F. C., Krause, U., Schellens, J. P. M., Vreeling-Sindelárová, H., and Meijer, A. J. (1997)Eur. J. Biochem. 243, 240–246). The aim of this study was to identify PI3Ks involved in the control of macroautophagic sequestration in human colon cancer HT-29 cells. An increase of class I PI3K products (phosphatidylinositol 3,4-bisphosphate and phosphatidylinositol 3,4,5-triphosphate) caused by either feeding cells with synthetic lipids (dipalmitoyl phosphatidylinositol 3,4-bisphosphate and dipalmitoyl phosphatidylinositol 3,4,5-triphosphate) or by stimulating the enzymatic activity by interleukin-13 reduced macroautophagy. In contrast, an increase in the class III PI3K product (phosphatidylinositol 3-phosphate), either by feeding cells with a synthetic lipid or by overexpressing the p150 adaptor, stimulates macroautophagy. Transfection of a specific class III PI3K antisense oligonucleotide greatly inhibited the rate of macroautophagy. In accordance with a role of class III PI3K, wortmannin (an inhibitor of PI3Ks) inhibits macroautophagic sequestration and protein degradation in the low nanomolar range (IC50 5–15 nm). Further in vitro enzymatic assay showed that 3-methyladenine inhibits the class III PI3K activity. Dipalmitoyl phosphatidylinositol 3-phosphate supplementation or p150 overexpression rescued the macroautophagic pathway in HT-29 cells overexpressing a GTPase-deficient mutant of the Gαi3 protein suggesting that both class III PI3K and trimeric Gi3 protein signaling are required in the control macroautophagy in HT-29 cells. In conclusion, our results demonstrate that distinct classes of PI3K control the macroautophagic pathway in opposite directions. The roles of PI3Ks in macroautophagy are discussed in the context of membrane recycling. 3-Methyladenine which stops macroautophagy at the sequestration step in mammalian cells also inhibits the phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K) activity raising the possibility that PI3K signaling controls the macroautophagic pathway (Blommaart, E.

In mammalian cells, the macroautophagic pathway starts with the sequestration of cytoplasmic material (including mitochondria, peroxisomes, smooth and rough membranes, and cytosolic constituents: proteins, glycogen, neutral lipids, RNA, and ribosomes) to form an early autophagosome. The membrane of early autophagosomes is derived from ribosome-free regions of the rough endoplasmic reticulum (5.Dunn Jr., W.A. J. Cell Biol. 1990; 110: 1923-1933Crossref PubMed Scopus (515) Google Scholar) and/or a related organelle called the phagophore (see Ref. 6.Fengsrud M. Roos N. Berg T. Liou W.L. Slot J.W. Seglen P.O. Exp. Cell Res. 1995; 221: 504-519Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar and references therein). After acidification the early autophagosome is transformed in a late autophagosome. Fusion between late autophagosomes and lysosomes triggers the degradation of sequestered material into autolysosomes. Material from the endocytic pathway can be imported in autophagic vacuoles at different steps of their maturation (7.Liou W. Geuze H.J. Geelen M.J.H. Slot J.W. J.

Recently, studies have shed light on the intracellular mechanisms that control membrane flow along the autophagic/lysosomal pathway in mammalian cells (reviewed in Refs. 9.Blommaart E.F.C.

Signal. 1997; 9: 125-130Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). It has been suggested that the phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K)1 signaling cascade controls macroautophagy (11.Blommaart E.F.C. Krause U. Schellens J.P.M. Vreeling-Sindelárová H. Meijer A.J. Eur. J. Biochem. 1997; 243: 240-246Crossref PubMed Scopus (731) Google Scholar) and that 3-MA, an inhibitor of macroautophagic sequestration (12.Seglen P.O. Gordon P.B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1982; 79: 1889-1892Crossref PubMed Scopus (1181) Google Scholar), behaves as a PI3K inhibitor. PI3K belongs to a family of enzymes that phosphorylates the 3′-hydroxyl group on the inositol ring of phosphoinositides (reviewed in Refs.13.Vanhaesebroeck B. Leevers S.J. Panayotou G. Waterfield M.D. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1997; 22: 267-272Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (835) Google Scholar, 14.Toker A. Cantley L.C.

These phospholipids are involved in a large array of signal transduction pathways controlling mitogenic responses, differentiation, apoptosis, cytoskeletal organization, and membrane flow along the secretory and endocytic pathways (reviewed in Ref. 17.Martin T.J.F. Annu. Rev. Cell Dev. Biol. 1998; 14: 231-264Crossref PubMed Scopus (452) Google Scholar). PI3Ks are classified into three classes. Class I enzymes are composed of catalytic p110 subunits and p85 adaptors. The SH2 motif contained in p85 adaptors bind to phosphorylated Tyr residues thereby linking the catalytic subunit to the Tyr kinase signaling pathway (class IA). A member of the class I PI3K family (class IB, p110γ/p101) is activated by subunits of trimeric G proteins (18.Stephens L. Smrcka A. Cooke F.T. Jackson T.R. Sterweis P.C. Hawkins P.T.

Class I PI3Ks phosphorylate PtdIns, PtdIns(4)P, PtdIns(4,5)P2 but in vivo PtdIns(4,5)P2 is likely to be the favorite substrate. Class II enzymes are large enzymes (>200 kDa) characterized by a C-terminal containing a C2 domain (20.MacDouglas L.K. Domin J. Waterfield M.D. Curr. Biol. 1995; 5995: 1404-1414Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (128) Google Scholar, 21.Molz L. Chen Y.W. Hirano M. Williams L.T. J. Biol.

Class III enzymes are homologous to the archetypal Vps34p characterized inSaccharomyces cerevisiae which only produce PtdIns(3)P (24.Schu P.V. Takegawa K. Fry M.J. Stack J.H. Waterfield M.D. Emr S.D. Science. 1993; 260: 88-91Crossref PubMed Scopus (806) Google Scholar). Vps34p function requires its association with a myristylated serine kinase Vps15p (25.Stack J.H. Herman P.K. Schu P.V. Emr S.D. EMBO J. 1993; 12: 2195-2204Crossref PubMed Scopus (266) Google Scholar). The complex Vps15p·Vps34p is of fundamental importance in controlling vesicular transport to the yeast vacuole (reviewed in Ref. 26.Wurmser A.E. Gary J.D. Emr S.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 9129-9132Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (197) Google Scholar). The human homologue of Vps34p has been shown to be associated with a p150 myristylated protein kinase (27.Panaretou C. Domin J. Cockcroft S. Waterfield M.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 2477-2485Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (186) Google Scholar). The goal of the present study was to identify PI3Ks involved in the control of macroautophagy. For this purpose we have used the human colon cancer HT-29 cells which have been demonstrated to be an appropriate model to investigate the signaling pathway that controls macroautophagy (28.Ogier-Denis E. Couvineau A. Maoret J.J. Houri J.J. Bauvy C. De Stefanis D. Isidoro C. Laburthe M. Codogno P. J. Biol.

J. 1999; 337: 289-295Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In the present study we show that macroautophagic sequestration is distinctly controlled by class I and class III PI3K. Stimulation of class I PI3K activity inhibits macroautophagy at the sequestration step whereas the activity of class III PI3K is required to trigger autophagic sequestration. HT-29 and Q204L-expressing cells were cultured as described previously (30.Ogier-Denis E. Houri J.J. Bauvy C. Codogno P. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 28593-28600Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar). Cells were maintained at 37 °C under 10% CO2/air atmosphere in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum, 1% penicillin-streptomycin (100 units/ml). 3-MA, phosphoinositides (PtdIns, PtdIns(4)P, and PtdIns(4,5)P2), NADH, metrizamide, and other chemicals were purchased from Sigma. Adenosine was from ICN, histone 2B was from Roche Molecular Biochemicals (Germany). Enzymes, synthetic oligonucleotides, cell culture reagents such as, Geneticin (G418) and LipofectAMINE were from Life Technologies, Inc. (Eragny, France). Nitrocellulose membranes were from Schleicher and Schuell (Dassel, Germany). The phosphoinositides PtdIns(3,4)P2, PtdIns(3,4,5)P3, and rabbit antibodies against p85 and p110α subunits of the class I PI3K were from TEBU (Le Perray en Yvelines, France). Goat anti-PKB polyclonal antibody was from Santa Cruz Biotechnology. The bicinchoninic acid (BCA) kit was from Pierce (Rockford, IL). IL-13 and cDNA encoding for the p150 adaptor were kindly provided by A. Minty (Sanofi Elf BioRecherche, France) and Dr. M. D. Waterfield and C. Panaretou (Ludwig Institute for Cancer Research, London), respectively. Rediprime random primer labeling kit, N+-Hybond membranes, and the radioisotopes [γ-32P]ATP (specific activity 10 mCi/mmol), [32P]dCTP (specific activity 10 mCi/mmol), andl-[U-14C]valine (specific activity 288.5 mCi/mmol) were from Amersham Pharmacia Biotech (Les Ulis, France). Cells were gently washed three times with phosphate-buffered saline (pH 7.4) and then twice with homogenization buffer (50 mm potassium phosphate, pH 7.5, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 300 mmsucrose, 100 μg/ml bovine serum albumin, 0.01% Tween 20). Cells were homogenized in cold homogenization buffer by 13 strokes in a glass/Teflon homogenizer on ice. A post-nuclear supernatant was prepared by centrifugation at 300 × g for 10 min at 4 °C. Post-nuclear material was layered on the top of a 4-ml density cushion of buffered metrizamide/sucrose (10% sucrose, 8% metrizamide, 1 mm EDTA, 100 μg/ml bovine serum albumin, 0.01% Tween 20, pH 7.5) and centrifuged at 7,000 × g for 60 min (31.Kopitz J. Kisen G.Ø. Gordon P.B. Bohley P. Seglen P.O. J. Cell Biol. 1990; 111: 941-953Crossref PubMed Scopus (191) Google Scholar). Finally, the pellet was washed once with homogenization buffer and resuspended in buffer containing 2 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.4), 50 mm mannitol, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 0.5 μg/ml aprotinin, and 0.7 μg/ml pepstatin. The suspension was sonicated (VibraCell sonicator, model 72434; power setting 3, microtip, for 20 s at 20% charge) and centrifuged for 10 min at 10,000 × g at 4 °C. The LDH activity was determined by measuring the oxidation of NADH with pyruvate as substrate at 340 nm. When used, WT, LY294002, synthetic lipids, and IL-13 were exposed to the cells for a period of 4 h. In order to maintain PI3K inhibition by WT, fresh WT was added every hour for a total incubation time of 4 h. Protein degradation was determined as previously reported (30.Ogier-Denis E. Houri J.J. Bauvy C. Codogno P. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 28593-28600Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar). HT-29 cells were incubated for 18 h at 37 °C with 0.2 μCi/ml of l-[14C]valine. Unincorporated radioisotope was removed by three rinses with phosphate-buffered saline (pH 7.4). Cells were then incubated in nutrient-free medium (without amino acids and in absence of fetal calf serum) supplemented with 0.1% bovine serum albumin and 10 mm cold valine throughout the chase period. When required 3-MA (10 mm) was added at the beginning of the chase period. After the first hour of incubation, at which time short-lived proteins were being degraded, the chase medium was replaced with the appropriate fresh medium and the incubation continued for an additional 4 h. Cells were scraped into 0.5 ml of phosphate-buffered saline and the radiolabeled proteins present in the 4-h media and cells were precipitated with 10% trichloroacetic acid, 1% phosphotungstic acid (v/v) at 4 °C. The precipitated proteins were separated from the soluble radioactivity by centrifugation at 600 × g for 10 min then dissolved in 1 ml of Soluene 350 (Packard) and the associated radioactivity was measured. The rate of protein degradation was calculated as acid soluble radioactivity recovered from both cells and medium. When used, WT, LY294002, synthetic lipids, and IL-13, were added at the beginning of the chase period. In order to maintain PI3K inhibition by WT, we added fresh WT every hour for a total incubation time of 4 h. PKB activity was determined after immunoprecipitation of HT-29 cell lysates with the goat anti-PKB polyclonal antibody (1/250) using histone 2B as substrate as described previously (32.Franke T.F. Yang S.-I. Chang T.O. Datta K. Kazlauskas A. Morrison D. Kaplan D.R. Tsichlis P.N. Cell. 1995; 81: 727-736Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1829) Google Scholar). Briefly, cells grown on 25-cm2 plates were washed once in cold phosphate-buffered saline (pH 7.4) and lysed with 1 ml of lysis buffer (1% Triton X-100, 10% glycerol, 137 mmNaCl, 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 10 μg/ml aprotinin, and leupeptin, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 20 mm sodium fluoride, 1 mm disodium pyrophosphate, and 1 mm Na3VO4). After preclearing, lysates were immunoprecipitated with goat anti-PKB polyclonal antibody using binding protein A-Sepharose to sediment the complexes. After three washes with kinase buffer (20 mmHepes, pH 7.4, 1 mm MgCl2, 1 mmMnCl2), reactions were performed for 30 min at 25 °C under continuous agitation in kinase buffer containing 0.05 mg/ml histone 2B, 5 μm ATP, 1 mm dithiothreitol, and 10 μCi of [γ-32P]ATP. The products of the kinase reactions were separated on 15% SDS-polyacrylamide gels, transferred onto nitrocellulose membranes, and exposed. Resulting autoradiograms were analyzed. When necessary the same membranes were analyzed subsequently by Western blot using goat anti-PBK to visualize the endogenous protein. Bands were developed by an enhanced chemiluminescence detection kit (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) using secondary antibody coupled to horseradish peroxidase. The p110α, p85, p150, and villin probes were 32P-labeled to a specific activity of 109 cpm/μg by random priming. Hybridization was performed at 45 °C in the presence of formamide and high stringency washes were performed in 0.1 × SSC, 0.1% SDS at 60 °C. cDNA was synthesized from mRNA isolated from HT-29 cells and was used to amplify a full-length cDNA encoding p110α and class III PI3K subunits, using RT-PCR. The forward PCR primers were: 5′-GACACTATTGTGTAACTATGGGGG-3′ for p110α, 5′-GATCTCTGTACCTTCTTGATATGGAG-3′ for class III PI3K, and 5′-GCAGATGGTTTCTGTAG-3′ for p150. The reverse PCR primers were: 5′-GTGTTAGGATATCTTGGGGTAAA-3′ for p110α, 5′-TTTGAAGAATAAGTTGATCTTGAGG-3′ for class III PI3K, and 5′-GAATGGAGGGGTACTGATGC-3′ for p150. cDNA (1 μg/ml) encoding the p150 was introduced into exponentially growing HT-29 cells by the LipofectAMINE method. Following transfection (48 h), cells were used for different experiments. Phosphorothioate oligonucleotide was synthesized so as to be anticomplementary to the sequence of class III PI3K (5′-TCCCCCCATCGCACCGTCTGC-3′) (33.Siddhanta U. McIlroy J. Shah A. Zhang Y.T. Backer J.M. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 143: 1647-1659Crossref PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar). Class III PI3K antisense was introduced into exponentially growing HT-29 cells by the LipofectAMINE method. Following transfection cells were used. Synthetic phosphatidylinositide phosphate (0.1 mg/ml) and phosphatidylserine (0.1 mg/ml) were solubilized in a mixture of chloroform/methanol, 1:1 (v:v), dried under N2, and dispersed by sonication for 15 min at 20 °C in buffer containing 25 mm HEPES (pH 7.4) and 1 mmEDTA. Samples were centrifuged at 6000 × g for 15 min at 4 °C and the supernatant was added at cells for an incubation of 4 h in a nutrient-free medium. PI3K activity was determined by the modified method of Burgering et al. (34.Burgering B.M. Medema R.H. van de Wetering M.L. van der Eb A.J. McCormick F. Bos J.L. EMBO J. 1991; 10: 1103-1109Crossref PubMed Scopus (209) Google Scholar). Briefly, immunoprecipitates and the supernatant of the immunoprecipitation were resuspended in 80 μl of buffer containing 30 mm Hepes and 300 μm adenosine. To both samples, 50 μl of lipid mixture (synthetic lipid and phosphatidylserine) was added for 20 min. The assay of class I PI3K activity was performed on the immunoprecipitate using diC16PtdIns(4,5)P2 as substrate in the presence of Mg2+, whereas class III PI3K activity was performed on the supernatant of a two rounds immunoprecipitation, using phosphatidylinositol as substrate in the presence of Mn2+(18.Stephens L. Smrcka A. Cooke F.T. Jackson T.R. Sterweis P.C. Hawkins P.T. Cell. 1994; 77: 83-93Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (520) Google Scholar). The reaction was initiated by the addition of 20 μCi of [γ-32P]ATP, 100 μm ATP, 100 μm MgCl2+, or MnCl2+ and terminated after 15 min by the addition of 80 μl of 1 mHCl and 200 μl of chloroform/methanol, 1:1 (v:v). After vigorous mixing and centrifugation, the organic layer was removed, dried under N2, and resuspended in chloroform/methanol. Extracted lipids were separated by TLC in developing solvents: isopropyl alcohol/H2O/acetic acid, 65:34:1 (v:v:v), and then exposed to hyperfilm. Unlabeled standards (1 mg/ml) were revealed by exposure to iodine vapor. Lipids were identified by comparison with unlabeled standards. Recently it has been shown that the PI3K inhibitors WT and LY294002 stop the macroautophagic pathway at the sequestration step in rat hepatocytes (11.Blommaart E.F.C. Krause U. Schellens J.P.M. Vreeling-Sindelárová H. Meijer A.J. Eur. J. Biochem. 1997; 243: 240-246Crossref PubMed Scopus (731) Google Scholar). In order to investigate the role of PI3K in the control of macroautophagy in HT-29 cells, we have studied the effect of WT and LY294002 on the degradation of [14C]valine-labeled long-lived proteins (Fig. 1) and on the rate of sequestration of the cytosolic enzyme LDH into autophagic vacuoles (Table I). WT and LY294002 impaired protein degradation in a dose-dependent manner with IC50 values in the range of those previously reported for rat hepatocytes (11.Blommaart E.F.C. Krause U. Schellens J.P.M. Vreeling-Sindelárová H. Meijer A.J. Eur. J. Biochem. 1997; 243: 240-246Crossref PubMed Scopus (731) Google Scholar). Results reported in Table I show that 10 nm WT and 10 μm LY294002 are as potent as 10 mm 3-MA as inhibitors of autophagic sequestration of the cytosolic enzyme LDH.Table IAutophagic sequestration in HT-29 cells treated with different drugsTreatmentAutophagic sequestration of LDH%/hUntreated cells4.0 ± 0.6aValues are the mean ± (S.D.)

Open table in a new tab In order to explore the mechanism by which PI3K controls the macroautophagic pathway, we have first examined the effect of PI3K products administered to HT-29 cells in liposome form using phosphatidylserine as a carrier (see “Experimental Procedures”). Results reported in Fig.2 A, show that diC16PtdIns(3,4)P2 and diC16PtdIns(3,4,5)P3inhibited the degradation of long-lived proteins in a dose-dependent manner. In contrast, diC16PtdIns(4,5)P2 had no inhibitory effect on protein degradation over the concentration range used. The inhibitory effect of diC16PtdIns(3,4)P2 and diC16PtdIns(3,4,5)P3 on the macroautophagic pathway was confirmed by the assay of the sequestration of the cytosolic enzyme LDH (Table I). The relevance of the effect induced by the synthetic lipids in a cellular environment was studied by measuring the activity of the kinase Akt/PKB which is a well established target of PtdIns(3,4)P2 and PtdIns(3,4,5)P3 (35.Burgering B.M.T.

Science. 1997; 275: 665-668Crossref PubMed Scopus (1310) Google Scholar). A stimulation of Akt/PKB activity using the histone 2B as a substrate was observed in cells loaded with diC16PtdIns(3,4)P2 and diC16PtdIns(3,4,5)P3 (Fig.3). In contrast, no significant stimulation of PKB activity was detected in cells fed with diC16PtdIns(4,5)P2. From the results reported above we reasoned that an increase in PtdIns(3,4)P2 and PtdIns(3,4,5)P3 by stimulating the HT-29 cells PI3K activity should lead to an effect similar to that obtained with synthetic diC16PtdIns(3,4)P2, and diC16PtdIns(3,4,5)P3. It has been demonstrated that the pleiotropic cytokine IL-13 stimulates PI3K activity and the production of PtdIns(3,4)P2 and PtdIns(3,4,5)P3 in HT-29 cells (38.Wright K. Ward S.G. Kolios G. Westwick J. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 12626-12633Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). As shown in Fig. 2 B and Table I, IL-13 inhibited the macroautophagic pathway in HT-29 cells. Accordingly stimulation of the PI3K activity by IL-13 (Ref. 38.Wright K. Ward S.G. Kolios G. Westwick J. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 12626-12633Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar and data not shown) was associated with the activation of Akt/PKB (Fig. 3). The bulk of these results seem contradictory because inhibitors and products of PI3K have a similar inhibitory effect on the macroautophagic pathway. However, several classes of PI3K producing different types of phosphoinositides are expressed in the same cell. Thus we next investigated the expression of class I and class III PI3Ks in HT-29 cells. We focused our study on these two families because the class II PI3K does not produce PtdIns(3,4,5)P3 from PtdIns(4,5)P2 and the widely expressed class II isoform PI3K-C2α is poorly sensitive to WT (13.Vanhaesebroeck B.

J. 1997; 326: 139-147Crossref PubMed Scopus (219) Google Scholar). These characteristics make the involvement of class II PI3K in the control of macroautophagy unlikely. RT-PCR and Northern blot analyses were used to characterize the different classes of PI3K present in HT-29 cells (Fig.4 A). Two different mRNAs of catalytic subunits of PI3K were detected corresponding to the class I p110α and the class III PI3K, respectively. The presence of other class I PI3K catalytic subunits was not considered. Class I and class III PI3Ks were also identified by their enzymatic activities (Fig. 4 B). After specific immunoprecipitation of the class I PI3K from HT-29 homogenates enzymatic activities were determined in the pellet (class I activity) and supernatant (class III activity). Using PtdIns(4,5)P2 as a substrate we observed production of PtdIns(3,4,5)P3 in the pellet derived from IL-13-treated cells whereas the basal activity of class I PI3K was very low in unstimulated HT-29 cells (Fig. 4 B). In the supernatant, using PtdIns as a substrate, we observed the production of PtdIns(3)P when Mn2+ was present in the assay whereas the activity was barely detectable when Mg2+ was used instead of Mn2+ (data not shown). This cation dependence has been shown to be a hallmark of class III PI3K (39.Volinia S. Dhand R. Vanhaesebroeck B.S. MacDougall L.K. Domin J. Panaretou C. Waterfield M.D. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 3339-3348Crossref PubMed Scopus (308) Google Scholar). Furthermore, and in contrast to the class I PI3K, the activity of class III PI3K was not dependent on IL-13 treatment. In order to determine the role of class III PI3K in the control of macroautophagy, we have tested the effect of PtdIns(3)P, the only product of class III PI3K (24.Schu P.V. Takegawa K. Fry M.J.

Results reported on Fig.5 A show that diC16PtdIns(3)P-stimulated protein degradation in a dose-dependent manner whereas its isomer diC16PtdIns(4)P had no effect on protein degradation. According to these data diC16PtdIns(3)P but not diC16PtdIns (4.Mortimore G.E. Kadowaki M. Ciechanover A.J. Schwartz A.L. Cellular Proteolytic Systems.

Canstatin, a fragment of the α2 chain of type IV collagen, was produced as a recombinant molecule inEscherichia coli and 293 embryonic kidneys cells. Canstatin significantly inhibited human endothelial cell migration and murine endothelial cell tube formation. Additionally, canstatin potently inhibited 10% fetal bovine serum-stimulated endothelial cell proliferation and induced apoptosis, with no inhibition of proliferation or apoptosis observed on non-endothelial cells. Inhibition of endothelial proliferation was not concomitant with a change in extracellular signal-regulated kinase activation. We demonstrate that apoptosis induced by canstatin was associated with a down-regulation of the anti-apoptotic protein, FLIP. Canstatin also suppressed in vivo growth of large and small size tumors in two human xenograft mouse models with histology revealing decreased CD31-positive vasculature. Collectively, these results suggest that canstatin is a powerful therapeutic molecule for suppressing angiogenesis.

Curr. Opin. Cell. Biol. 1996; 8: 618-624Crossref PubMed Scopus (553) Google Scholar). Type IV collagen is composed of six distinct gene products, namely α1–α6 (2.Prockop D.J. Kivirikko K.I. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1995; 64: 403-434Crossref PubMed Scopus (1373) Google Scholar). The α1 and α2 isoforms are ubiquitously present in human basement membranes (3.Paulsson M. Crit. Rev. Biochem. Mol. Biol. 1992; 27: 93-127Crossref PubMed Scopus (467) Google Scholar), whereas the other four isoforms exhibit restricted distributions (4.Kalluri R. Shield C.F. Todd P. Hudson B.G. Neilson E.G. J. Clin. Invest. 1997; 99: 2470-2478Crossref PubMed Scopus (262) Google Scholar). Type IV collagen promotes cell adhesion, migration, differentiation, and growth (3.Paulsson M. Crit. Rev. Biochem. Mol. Biol. 1992; 27: 93-127Crossref PubMed Scopus (467) Google Scholar) and via these functions may play a crucial role in angiogenesis, the process of formation of new blood vessels from pre-existing capillaries (5.Madri J.A. Pratt B.M. J. Histochem. Cytochem. 1986; 34: 85-91Crossref PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar, 6.Folkman J. Ann. Surg. 1972; 175: 409-416Crossref PubMed Scopus (1064) Google Scholar). In the adult, new blood vessels arise via angiogenesis, a process critical for normal physiological events such as wound repair and endometrium remodeling (7.Folkman J. Shing Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 10931-10934Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). It is now well documented that angiogenesis is required for metastasis and growth of solid tumors beyond a few mm3 in size (6.Folkman J. Ann.

Several studies have shown that inhibitors of collagen metabolism have anti-angiogenic properties, supporting the notion that basement membrane collagen synthesis and deposition is crucial for blood vessel formation and survival (9.Maragoudakis M.E.

Additionally, basement membrane organization is dependent on the assembly of a type IV collagen network, which is speculated to occur via the C-terminal globular non-collagenous (NC1) domain of type IV collagen (1.Timpl R. Curr. Opin. Cell. Biol. 1996; 8: 618-624Crossref PubMed Scopus (553) Google Scholar, 11.Timpl R. Wiedemann H. van Delden V. Furthmayr H. Kuhn K. Eur. J.

Based on these observations, we postulated that the NC1 domain of collagen type IV could disrupt tumor angiogenesis and thereby inhibit tumor growth. Our laboratory evaluated the anti-angiogenic potential of all six NC1 domains of type IV collagen, and in the present study, we demonstrate the ability of the NC1 domain of the α2 chain of type IV collagen, which we have named canstatin, to inhibit endothelial cell tube formation, migration, and proliferation and to induce apoptosis in vitro, as well as suppress tumor growth in vivo. The sequence encoding canstatin was amplified by PCR1 from the α2 NCI (IV)/pDS vector (12.Neilson E.G. Kalluri R. Sun M.J. Gunwar S. Danoff T. Mariyama M. Myers J.C. Reeders S.T. Hudson B.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 8402-8405Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) using a forward primer (5′-CGGGATCCTGTCAGCATCGGCTACCTC-3′) and a reverse primer (5′-CCCAAGCTTCAGGTTCTTC ATGCACAC-3′). The resulting cDNA fragment was digested with BamHI and HindIII and ligated into predigested pET22b(+) (Novagen, Madison, WI). This placed canstatin downstream of and in-frame with the pelB leader sequence, allowing for periplasmic localization and expression of soluble protein. Additional vector sequences encode the amino acids MDIGINSD. The 3′ end of the sequence was ligated in-frame with the polyhistidine tag sequence. Additional vector sequence between the 3′ end of the cDNA and the His tag encoded the amino acids KLAAALE. Positive clones were sequenced on both strands. Plasmid constructs encoding canstatin were first transformed intoE. coli HMS174 (Novagen, Madison, WI) and then transformed into BL21 for expression (Novagen, Madison, WI). An overnight bacterial culture was used to inoculate a 500-ml culture in LB medium. This culture was grown for approximately 4 h until the cells reached anA 600 of 0.6. Then, protein expression was induced by addition of isopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside to a final concentration of 0.5 mm. After a 2-h induction, cells were harvested by centrifugation at 5,000 × g and lysed by resuspension in 6 m guanidine, 0.1 mNaH2PO4, 0.01 m Tris-HCl, pH 8.0. Resuspended cells were sonicated briefly and centrifuged at 12,000 × g for 30 min. The supernatant fraction was passed over a 5-ml of nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid-agarose column (Qiagen) 4–6 times at a speed of 2 ml/min. Nonspecifically bound protein was removed by washing with 15 ml each of 10, 25, and 50 mm imidazole in 8m urea, 0.1 m NaH2PO4, 0.01 m Tris-HCl, pH 8.0. Canstatin protein was eluted from the column with two concentrations of imidazole (125 and 250 mm) in 8 m urea, 0.1 mNaH2PO4, 0.01 m Tris-HCl, pH 8.0. The eluted protein was dialyzed twice against 2 liters of PBS at 4 °C. A portion of the total protein precipitated during dialysis. Dialyzed protein was collected and centrifuged at approximately 3,500 × g and separated into pellet and supernatant fractions. Protein concentration in each fraction was determined by the BCA assay (Pierce) and quantitative (densitometric) SDS-PAGE analysis. The fraction of total protein in the pellet was approximately 40%, with the remaining 60% recovered as a soluble protein. The total protein yield was approximately 15 mg/liter. We used the pDS plasmid containing α2(IV)NC1 (12.Neilson E.G. Kalluri R. Sun M.J. Gunwar S. Danoff T. Mariyama M. Myers J.C. Reeders S.T. Hudson B.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 8402-8405Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) to PCR-amplify canstatin in a way that it would add a leader signal sequence in-frame into the pcDNA 3.1 (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA) eukaryotic expression vector. The leader sequence from the 5′ end of full-length α2(IV) chain was cloned 5′ to the NC1 domain to enable protein secretion into the culture medium. The canstatin containing recombinant vectors were sequenced using flanking primers. Error-free cDNA clones were further purified and used for in vitro translation studies to confirm protein expression (data not shown). The canstatin containing plasmid and control plasmid was used to transfect 293 cells using the calcium chloride method. Transfected clones were selected by geneticin (Life Technologies Inc.) antibiotic treatment. The cells were passed for 3 weeks in the presence of the antibiotic until no cell death was evident. Clones were expanded into T-225 flasks and grown until confluent. Then, the supernatant was collected and concentrated using an Amicon concentrator (Amicon, Beverly, MA). The concentrated supernatant was analyzed by SDS-PAGE and immunoblotting and enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay for canstatin expression. Strong binding in the supernatant was detected by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (data not shown). Canstatin containing supernatant was subjected to affinity chromatography using canstatin-specific antibodies (13.Gunwar S. Ballester F. Kalluri R. Timoneda J. Chonko A.M. Edwards S.J. Noelken M.E. Hudson B.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 15318-15324Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). A major peak was identified, containing a monomer of about 24 kDa that was immunoreactive with canstatin antibodies. Bovine calf pulmonary aortic endothelial (CPAE) cells were grown to confluence in DMEM with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS) and kept confluent for 48 h. Cells were harvested by trypsinization (Life Technologies, Inc.) at 37 °C for 5 min. A suspension of 12,500 cells in DMEM with 0.5% FCS was added to each well of a 24-well plate coated with 10 μg/ml fibronectin. The cells were incubated for 24 h at 37 °C with 5% CO2 and 95% humidity. Medium was removed and replaced with DMEM containing 0.5% FCS (unstimulated) or 10% FCS (stimulated and treated cells). 786-0, PC-3, and HEK 293 cells, used as controls, were also grown to confluency, trypsinized, and plated in the same manner. Cells were treated with concentrations of canstatin ranging from 0.025 to 40 μg/ml in triplicate. In thymidine incorporation experiments all wells received 1 μCi of [3H]thymidine at the time of treatment. After 24 h, medium was removed, and the wells were washed 3 times with PBS. Radioactivity was extracted with 1n NaOH and added to a scintillation vial containing 4 ml of ScintiVerse II (Fisher) solution. Thymidine incorporation was measured using a scintillation counter. In the methylene blue staining method, 3,100 cells were added to each well of a 96-well plate and treated as above, and then cells were counted using the method of Oliver et al. (14.Oliver M.H. Harrison N.K. Bishop J.E. Cole P.J. Laurent G.J. J. Cell Sci. 1989; 92: 513-518Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). All wells were washed one time with 100 μl of PBS, and the cells were fixed by adding 100 μl of 10% formalin in neutral-buffered saline (Sigma) for 30 min at room temperature. After formalin removal, cells were stained with a solution of 1% methylene blue (Sigma) in 0.01 m borate buffer, pH 8.5, for 30 min at room temperature. After removal of staining solution, the wells were washed 5 times with 100 μl of 0.01 m borate buffer, pH 8.5,. Methylene blue was extracted from the cells with 100 μl of 0.1n HCl, ethanol (1:1 mixture) for 1 h at room temperature. The amount of methylene blue staining was measured on a microplate reader (Bio-Rad) using light absorbance at 655 nm wavelength. Matrigel (Collaborative Biomolecules, Bedford, MA) was added (320 μl) to each well of a 24-well plate and allowed to polymerize (15.Grant D.S. Kibbey M.C. Kinsella J.L. Cid M.C. Kleinman H.K. Pathol. Res. Pract. 1994; 190: 854-863Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). A suspension of 25,000 mouse aortic endothelial cells (MAE) in EGM-2 (Clonetics, Walkersville, MD) medium without antibiotic was passed into each well coated with matrigel (15.Grant D.S. Kibbey M.C. Kinsella J.L. Cid M.C. Kleinman H.K. Pathol. Res. Pract. 1994; 190: 854-863Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). The cells were treated with either canstatin, BSA, sterile PBS, or α5-NC1 domain in increasing concentrations. All assays were performed in triplicate. Cells were incubated for 24–48 h at 37 °C and viewed using a CK2 Olympus microscope (3.3 ocular, 10× objective). The cells were then photographed using 400 DK-coated TMAX film (Eastman Kodak Co.). Cells were stained with diff-quik fixative (Sigma) and photographed again (15.Grant D.S. Kibbey M.C. Kinsella J.L. Cid M.C. Kleinman H.K. Pathol. Res. Pract. 1994; 190: 854-863Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). Ten fields were viewed, and tubes were counted and averaged. The inhibitory effect of canstatin on VEGF-induced chemotaxis was tested on human umbilical endothelial cells (HUVECs) using the Boyden chamber assay (Neuroprobe, MD). HUVECs were grown in M199 (Life Technologies Inc.) containing 10% FBS and 5 ng/ml DiIC18(3) living fluorescent stain (Molecular Probes, Eugene, OR) overnight. After trypsinizing, washing, and diluting cells in M199 containing 0.5% FBS, 60,000 cells were seeded on the upper chamber wells, together with or without canstatin (0.01 or 1 μg/ml). M199 medium containing 1% FBS plus 10 ng/ml VEGF (R & D Systems, Minneapolis, MN) was placed in the lower chamber as a chemotactant. The cell-containing compartments were separated from the chemotactant with polycarbonate filters (Poretics, CA) of 8-μm pore size. The chamber was incubated at 37 °C with 5% CO2and 95% humidity for 4.5 h. After discarding the non-migrated cells and washing the upper wells with PBS, the filters were scraped with a plastic blade, fixed in 4% formaldehyde in PBS, and placed on a glass slide. By using a fluorescent high power field, several independent homogenous images were recorded by a digital SenSys™ camera operated with Image Processing Software PMIS (Photometrics, CO). Cells were counted by employing the OPTIMIZE 6.0 software program (BioScan, WA) (16.Klemke R.L. Yebra M. Bayna E.M. Cheresh D.A. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 127: 859-866Crossref PubMed Scopus (248) Google Scholar). HUVEC cells were cultured overnight in McCoy's medium supplemented with 20% FBS, 1% penicillin/streptomycin, 100 μg/ml heparin, and 50 μg/ml endothelial mitogen (Biomedical Technologies). The following day cells were washed and grown for 4 h in low serum medium (McCoy's medium supplemented with 1% penicillin/streptomycin, 100 μg/ml heparin, and 5% FBS). After 4 h, the medium was replaced with fresh low serum medium with or without 20 μg/ml canstatin. One hour later the serum concentration was adjusted to 20%, and endothelial mitogen was added to 50 μg/ml. At 0, 5, 10, 25, and 40 min the cells were washed with PBS and lysed with passive lysis mix (Promega, Madison WI) plus leupeptin, phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, NaF, Na3VO4, β-glycerophosphate, and sodium pyrophosphate. Lysates were quantified for protein concentration and separated on 12% SDS-PAGE gels. Western blots of serum or serum + canstatin-treated HUVEC lysates were performed to detect levels of phospho-ERK using anti-phospho-ERK antibodies (New England Biolabs, Beverly, MA). Total ERK protein was detected on the same nitrocellulose membrane with anti-ERK antibody (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Santa Cruz, CA) illustrating equal amounts of total ERK protein. HUVEC cells were cultured overnight in McCoy's medium supplemented with 20% FBS, 1% penicillin/streptomycin, 100 μg/ml heparin, and 50 μg/ml endothelial mitogen (Biomedical Technologies). The following day, growth factor-containing medium was removed and replaced with medium containing 20% serum alone (with or without 20 μg/ml canstatin) or medium with 20% serum and growth factors (with or without 20 μg/ml canstatin). All wells received polymyxin B to eliminate potential effects of endotoxin. Cells were lysed at 30, 60, and 180 min with passive lysis mix (Promega, Madison, WI) plus leupeptin, phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, NaF, Na3VO4, β-glycerophosphate, and sodium pyrophosphate, and the lysates were analyzed for FLIP levels by Western blot with anti-FLIP antibody (17.Sata M. Walsh K. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 33103-33106Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar). 0.5 × 106 CPAE cells were added to each well of a 6-well tissue culture plate in 10% FBS-supplemented DMEM (BioWhittaker, Walkersville, MD) overnight. The next day the fresh medium was added to all wells together with 15 μg/ml canstatin or 40 ng/ml tumor necrosis factor-α. Control cells received an equal volume of PBS. After 24 h of treatment medium containing detached cells was collected, and attached cells were trypsinized and added together with detached cells and centrifuged at 3,000 × g. Cells were then washed and phosphatidylserine externalization (an early apoptotic indicator) was measured by labeling with FITC-labeled annexin V (CLONTECH, Palo Alto, CA) according to manufacturer's instructions. Annexin-FITC-labeled cells were counted using a Becton-Dickenson FACScan Plus flow cytometer. For each treatment 15,000 cells were counted and stored in listmode. The data were then analyzed using standard Cell Quest software. Human prostate adenocarcinoma cells (PC-3) were harvested from culture, and 2 × 106 cells in sterile PBS were injected subcutaneously into 7–9-week-old male SCID mice. The tumors grew for approximately 4 weeks after which animals were divided into groups of 4 mice. Experimental groups were injected daily intraperitoneally with canstatin at a dosage of 10 mg/kg in a total volume of 0.1 ml of PBS. The control group received equal volumes of PBS each day. In a second PC-3 experiment, PC-3 cells were harvested from culture, and 3 × 106 cells were injected into 6–7-week-old athymic nude mice, and tumors grew for approximately 2 weeks after which animals were divided into groups of 4 mice. Experimental groups were injected daily intraperitoneally with canstatin at a dosage of 3 mg/kg in a total volume of 0.2 ml of PBS or recombinant mouse endostatin at a dosage of 8 mg/kg in the same volume of PBS. The control group received equal volumes of PBS each day. Tumor length and width were measured using a Vernier caliper, and the tumor volume was calculated using the standard formula length × width squared × 0.52 (18.O'Reilly M.S. Boehm T. Shing Y. Fukai N. Vasios G. Lane W.S. Flynn E. Birkhead J.R. Olsen B.R. Folkman J. Cell. 1997; 88: 277-285Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (4236) Google Scholar). Volume ± S.E. is plotted over the treatment period. For the renal cell carcinoma cell model, 2 × 106 786-0 cells were injected subcutaneously into 7–9-week-old male athymic nude mice. The tumors were allowed to grow to ∼700 or ∼100 mm3. Each group contained 6 mice. Canstatin in sterile PBS was injected intraperitoneally daily (10 mg/kg) for 10 days. The control group received the same volume of PBS. At the end of treatment, mice were sacrificed, and the tumors were excised. The removed tumors were dissected with a scalpel into several pieces approximately 3–4 mm thick and then fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde for 24 h. Tissues were then switched to PBS for 24 h before dehydration and paraffin embedding. After embedding in paraffin, 3-μm tissue sections were cut and mounted. Sections were deparaffinized, rehydrated, and pretreated with 300 μg/ml protease XXIV (Sigma) at 37 °C for 5 min. Digestion was stopped in 100% ethanol. Sections were air-dried, rehydrated, and blocked with 10% rabbit serum. Next, slides were incubated at 4 °C overnight with a 1:50 dilution of rat anti-mouse CD31 monoclonal antibody (PharMingen), followed by two successive incubations at 37 °C for 30 min with 1:50 dilutions of rabbit anti-rat immunoglobulin (Dako, Carpinteria, CA) and rat APAAP (Dako). The color reaction was performed with new fuchsin. Sections were counterstained with hematoxylin. Human canstatin was produced in E. coli as a fusion protein with a C-terminal six histidine tag using pET-22b(+), a bacterial expression plasmid, and also produced as a secreted soluble protein in 293 embryonic kidney cells using the pcDNA 3.1 eukaryotic vector. The E. coli-expressed protein was isolated predominantly as a soluble protein, and SDS-PAGE analysis revealed a monomeric band at 27 and 3 kDa that arises from polylinker and histidine tag sequences. Uncleaved signal peptide may account for additional molecular weight seen in some preparations (Fig.1, A and B). Canstatin protein was analyzed by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (PAGE) and detected by Western blotting with an anti-polyhistidine tag antibody (Fig. 1, C andD). Canstatin antibodies also detected bacterially expressed recombinant canstatin protein (data not shown). The 293 cell-produced recombinant protein (without any purification or detection tags) was isolated using affinity chromatography, and a pure monomeric form was detected in the major peak by SDS-PAGE and immunoblot analyses (Fig. 1,E and F). In addition, human canstatin was isolated from human placenta by gel filtration, high pressure liquid chromatography, and affinity chromatography techniques; a 24-kDa molecule was detected by SDS-PAGE and immunoblot analyses (data not shown). We tested the ability of canstatin to disrupt endothelial cell tube formation in matrigel, a solid gel of mouse basement membrane proteins derived from sarcomas. When mouse aortic endothelial cells are cultured on matrigel, they rapidly align and form hollow tube-like structures (15.Grant D.S. Kibbey M.C. Kinsella J.L. Cid M.C. Kleinman H.K. Pathol. Res. Pract. 1994; 190: 854-863Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). Canstatin, produced in 293 cells, selectively inhibited endothelial tube formation in a dose-dependent manner, with a near-complete inhibition of tube formation seen with the addition of 1 μg of canstatin protein (Fig. 2,A and C). Neither a control protein, bovine serum albumin (BSA), nor the NC1 domain of type IV collagen α5 chain had an effect on endothelial tube formation (Fig. 2, A andD). During the process of angiogenesis, endothelial cells proliferate and migrate to form new blood vessels. Therefore, we assessed the effect of canstatin on endothelial cell migration. HUVECs were cultured in a Boyden chamber and stimulated to migrate toward a 10 ng/ml VEGF gradient (16.Klemke R.L. Yebra M. Bayna E.M. Cheresh D.A. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 127: 859-866Crossref PubMed Scopus (248) Google Scholar). Canstatin, produced in 293 cells, inhibited the migration of HUVECs with a significant effect observed at 10 ng/ml (Fig. 2, E and F). The ability of canstatin to inhibit both proliferation and migration of endothelial cells may indicate that it works at more than one step in the process of angiogenesis or that the effect is common to both migratory and proliferative processes. In thymidine incorporation assays of endothelial cell proliferation, using E. coli produced soluble protein, a dose-dependent inhibition of 10% serum-stimulated CPAE cells was detected with an ED50 value of 0.5 μg/ml (Fig.3 A). Furthermore, we found that HUVECs were also inhibited by canstatin with a similar ED50 value (Fig. 3 B). These results support earlier observations that α1 and α2 type IV collagen chains isolated from the Engelbreth-Holm-Swarm sarcoma tumor may be inhibitory to capillary endothelial cell proliferation (19.Madri J.A. Transplant. Immunol. 1997; 5: 179-183Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). No significant effect was observed on the proliferation of renal carcinoma cells (786-0), prostate cancer cells (PC-3), or human embryonic kidney cells (HEK 293) at canstatin doses up to 40 μg/ml (Fig. 3 C). Methylene blue colorimetric proliferation assay confirmed the results of the thymidine assay for the CPAE, PC-3, and HEK 293 cells (data not shown). In order to understand further the molecular mechanisms involved in the anti-proliferative and anti-migratory activities of canstatin, we assessed the effect of canstatin on ERK activation induced by 20% fetal bovine serum and endothelial mitogens. Fig. 3 D shows that ERK phosphorylation in HUVECs was evident within 5 min after growth factor stimulation, and treatment with 20 μg/ml canstatin did not alter early activation of ERK. A decrease in ERK phosphorylation was observed at later time points, a profile that is consistent with responses observed with several mitogens (20.Gupta K. Kshirsagar S. Li W. Gui L. Ramakrishnan S. Gupta P. Law P.Y. Hebbel R.P. Exp. Cell. Res. 1999; 247: 495-504Crossref PubMed Scopus (343) Google Scholar, 21.Pedram A. Razandi M. Levin E.R. J. Biol Chem. 1998; 273: 26722-26728Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (188) Google Scholar). These observations indicate that canstatin does not primarily work by inhibiting proximal events activated by VEGF or basic fibroblast growth factor receptors. In order to establish apoptosis of endothelial cells as a potential mode of action for canstatin, we used annexin V-FITC labeling of externalized phosphatidylserine to assess for apoptotic cells. Our results show that canstatin specifically induces apoptosis of endothelial cells (Fig. 3 E) with no significant effect observed on PC-3, 786-0, or HEK 293 cell lines (data not shown). It is probable that canstatin acts by predisposing cells to apoptosis, as evidenced by a steady decrease in FLIP protein levels during treatment with canstatin in the presence of both serum and growth factor (basic fibroblast growth factor and VEGF) stimulation (Fig. 3 F). Canstatin did not effect FLIP levels in the absence of growth factors. A transient increase in FLIP levels was seen with the addition of serum only medium, probably due to the removal of growth factors. In contrast, the addition of growth factor-containing medium induced a transient decrease in FLIP levels that returned to base line or increased in the absence of canstatin. Since endothelial cells express both Fas and FasL constitutively (17.Sata M. Walsh K. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 33103-33106Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar), it is likely that this decrease in FLIP sensitizes endothelial cells to the apoptotic signal. Furthermore, the lack of effect of canstatin on endothelial cells in the absence of growth factors indicates it may target angiogenic and not pre-formed endothelium. For in vivo experiments, established xenograft tumor models in mice were used to test the effectiveness of canstatin as an inhibitor of angiogenesis-dependent tumor growth. Canstatin, produced as soluble protein in E. coli, inhibited the growth of small (Fig. 4 A) and large (Fig. 4 B) renal cell carcinoma (786-0) tumors by 4- and 3-fold with respect to placebo-treated mice. Established human prostate (PC-3) tumors in severe combined immunodeficient (SCID) mice or athymic (nu/nu) mice exhibited fractional tumor volumes of 1.8–2.4-fold less than placebo-treated mice when treated with 10 (Fig.4 C) or 3 mg/kg (Fig. 4 D) canstatin, respectively. This decrease in tumor size was consistent with a decrease in CD31-positive vasculature (Fig. 4, E and F). A similar suppressive effect was observed with 8 mg/kg of endostatin (Fig. 4 D). Further studies will be required to determine the minimal effective doses of these proteins, but results in our laboratory indicate that a 5 mg/kg dose of endostatin is not able to suppress tumor growth (data not shown), suggesting that human canstatin may be more potent than endostatin. In all of the in vivostudies, mice appeared healthy with no signs of wasting, and none of the mice died during treatment. The ability of canstatin to inhibit specifically endothelial cell proliferation, migration, and tube formation strongly suggests that it is an anti-angiogenic agent and that it may function via a cell surface protein/receptor. Integrins are potential candidate molecules for binding to canstatin based on their extracellular matrix binding capacity and ability to modulate cell behavior such as migration and proliferation (22.Hynes R.O. Cell. 1992; 69: 11-25Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (9002) Google Scholar). In particular, αvβ3integrin is a possible canstatin receptor, due to its induction during angiogenesis and its promiscuous binding capacity (23.Brooks P.C. Clark R.A. Cheresh D.A. Science. 1994; 264: 569-571Crossref PubMed Scopus (2732) Google Scholar). Also, integrins α1β1 and α2β1have been implicated as cell adhesion receptors that bind to type IV collagen (24.Setty S. Kim Y. Fields G.B. Clegg D.O. Wayner E.A. Tsilibary E.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 12244-12249Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar), but whether canstatin is the collagen IV domain that is mediating this interaction or any other integrin binding has yet to be determined. The recent identification of other collagen-derived inhibitors of angiogenesis, such as endostatin and restin, C-terminal fragments of collagen XVIII and XV, respectively (18.O'Reilly M.S. Boehm T.

Furthermore, canstatin, endostatin, and restin are non- collagenous fragments of collagen molecules underscoring the importance of this portion of the protein in mediating cell behavior (2.Prockop D.J.

Future comparative studies with these inhibitors may also give insight into their unique mechanism of action."

Int. Rev. Immunol. 1998; 16: 457-499Crossref PubMed Scopus (671) Google Scholar). It does so by activating a set of transcription factors that includes NFκB and AP-1, which in turn promote production of effectors of the inflammatory response, such as the inducible forms of cycloxygenase and nitric oxide synthase (2.O'Neill L.A. Greene C. J. Leukocyte Biol. 1998; 63: 650-657Crossref PubMed Scopus (494) Google Scholar, 3.Dinarello C.A. Blood. 1996; 87: 2095-2147Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Interleukin 1 activity actually resides in each of two molecules, IL-1α and IL-1β, which act by binding to a common receptor composed of a ligand binding chain, the type I IL-1 receptor, and a required signaling component, the IL-1R accessory protein (AcP) (4.Sims J.E.

A third member of the family, the IL-1 receptor antagonist (IL-1ra), also binds to the type I IL-1 receptor but fails to bring about the subsequent interaction with AcP, thus not only not signaling itself but also, by blocking the receptor, preventing the action of the agonist IL-1s (8.Hannum C.H.

The two agonist IL-1s (IL-1α and IL-1β) are synthesized as larger precursors which undergo proteolytic removal of their pro-domains to generate the mature cytokines (14.March C.J. Mosley B. Larsen A.

At least for IL-1β, this processing is coupled to secretion (15.Cerretti D.P. Kozlosky C.J. Mosley B. Nelson N. Van Ness K. Greenstreet T.A. March C.J. Kronheim S.R. Druck T. Cannizzaro L.A.

IL-1ra, in contrast, contains a signal peptide and is secreted by the more traditional route through the endoplasmic reticulum (9.Eisenberg S.P. Evans R.J. Arend W.P. Verderber E. Brewer M.T.

Timans J.C. Kastelein R.A. Nature. 1996; 379: 591Crossref PubMed Scopus (259) Google Scholar). IL-18 induces the production of γ-interferon from T cells, especially in combination with IL-12, and stimulates the killing activity of cytotoxic T lymphocytes and NK cells by up-regulating Fas ligand (20.Dinarello C.A.

Like the agonist IL-1s, IL-18 contains a prodomain that is removed by the same protease, caspase-1, that processes IL-1β (21.Ghayur T. Banerjee S. Hugunin M. Butler D. Herzog L. Carter A. Quintal L.

We report here the sequences and some of the characteristics of four genes that appear to have descended from the same common ancestor as did IL-1α, IL-1β, IL-1ra, and IL-18. We propose that these novel molecules be designated FIL1δ, -ε, -ζ, and -η, with FIL1 being an acronym for Family of IL-1.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESCloning of Novel Human IL-1 Family MembersThe following details supplement the general descriptions given under “Results” for the cloning of the individual IL-1 family members.FIL1δA 469-base pair single-stranded32P-labeled PCR product spanning the entire mouse FIL1δ coding region (found in GenBankTMW08205) was used to probe a human placenta cDNA library (in λUni-ZAP XR; Stratagene number 937225) (hybridization in 40% formamide at 42 °C; wash in 0.3m NaCl at 55 °C). Several clones were isolated, all of which appeared to lack the full open reading frame by comparison with mouse FIL1δ. Vector-anchored PCR on DNA from the same library was used to isolate the remaining coding sequence.FIL1εA human genomic library (Stratagene catalog number 946205; in λFixII) was screened using a 32P-labeled single-strand DNA probe corresponding to the entire IL-1-like coding sequence present in GenBankTM EST AA030324 (hybridization in 45% formamide at 42 °C; wash in 0.3 m NaCl at 63 °C). The insert from one positive plaque was mapped to locate the hybridizing region, sequencing of which then revealed the 3′-most exon of the human FIL1ε gene. 5.3 kilobases of human genomic DNA to the 5′ side of this exon was isolated using theCLONTECH Human GenomeWalker kit (catalog number K1803-1). Sequencing of this DNA allowed identification of the remaining coding exons. The structure of the gene was confirmed by isolation of a PCR product in which the predicted exons were indeed spliced, using as template first-strand cDNA from the cell lines HL60 and THP1, and from human thymic tissue. Interestingly, while the original genomic DNA sequence coded for glutamine at amino acid 12, cDNA clones from all three sources contain arginine at amino acid 12.FIL1ζThe FIL1ζ open reading frame was identified in a cDNA library made from the pancreatic tumor cell line HPT-4.FIL1ηA human genomic DNA sequenced to identify theFIL1η 3′ exon was obtained using theCLONTECH Human GenomeWalker kit (catalog number K1803-1).Structure ModelingTemplate sequences for structure modeling were extracted from the Protein Data Bank (28.Bernstein F.C. Koetzle T.F. Williams G.J. Meyer Jr., E.F. Brice M.D. Rodgers J.R. Kennard O. Shimanouchi T. Tasumi M. Eur. J. Biochem. 1977; 80: 319-324Crossref PubMed Scopus (558) Google Scholar). A sequence alignment for the superfamily was generated based on that proposed by Bazan et al. (19.Bazan J.F. Timans J.C. Kastelein R.A. Nature. 1996; 379: 591Crossref PubMed Scopus (259) Google Scholar) for the IL-1s and IL-18, which appeared valid by examination of both cysteine and real versus predicted sheet alignments. Preliminary analysis using the program Gene Fold (29.Jaroszewski L. Rychlewski L. Zhang B. Godzik A. Protein Sci. 1998; 7: 1431-1440Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar) demonstrated that the experimentally determined structures for IL-1β (Protein Data Bank designations 1hib, 2i1b, 1iob, 1itb, and 21bi) and IL-1ra (Protein Data Bank designations 1ilr, 1ira, and i1rp) were valid templates for the new IL-1 family members FIL1δ, FIL1ε, and FIL1ζ. Although the sequence identity of the new IL-1-like cytokines is greater to IL-1ra, Gene Fold showed a stronger match to the structure of IL-1β. In addition, the various IL-1β structures appear better aligned structurally (as seen by superposition) than do the IL-1ra structures, so both templates were used for modeling. Modeler (30.Sali A. Potterton L. Yuan F. van Vlijmen H. Karplus M. Proteins. 1995; 23: 318-326Crossref PubMed Scopus (942) Google Scholar) was used to generate a family of 20 structures for each query sequence. All structures showed a well defined core β-trefoil, with higher variability in the outer loops; the per molecule probability density function (PDF) used by modeler varied from 1194 to 1984. The structure with the lowest overall PDF violation was visualized using a variable width ribbon based on the per residue PDF violation and showed that the highest violation was in the region of highest structural difference between IL-1ra and IL-1β. At this point the cysteine positions for the three models were revisited to ensure that no disulfide links were missed. A representative structure for each model was chosen by first ordering the models within a family by total PDF violation. After discarding structures with obvious problems, such as knots, the remaining members were then superimposed onto their mean. The structure with the lowest all atom root mean square deviation from the mean was chosen as the representative structure. Finally, the models were analyzed using Procheck (31.Laskowski R.A. Rullmannn J.A. MacArthur M.W. Kaptein R. Thornton J.M. J. Biomol. NMR. 1996; 8: 477-486Crossref PubMed Scopus (4329) Google Scholar) and it was shown that the structures are valid at 2.0-Å resolution with no major structural problems. The structure models for FIL1δ, FIL1ε, and FIL1ζ can be examined by contacting the authors.Intron/Exon MappingIntron placement was determined by direct cloning or amplification of genomic DNA from the various novel IL-1 loci. Primers were designed so that the PCR products overlapped one another to ensure that small introns were not overlooked. The sequence of the PCR products from genomic DNA was compared with the cDNA sequence in order to determine the exon/intron junctions.Chromosome MappingChromosome mapping was performed using the Genebridge 4 radiation hybrid panel (32.Gyapay G. Schmitt K. Fizames C. Jones H. Vega-Czarny N. Spillett D. Muselet D. Prud'Homme J.F. Dib C. Auffray C. Morissette J. Weissenbach J. Goodfellow P.N. Hum. Mol. Genet. 1996; 5: 339-346Crossref PubMed Scopus (424) Google Scholar) (catalog number RH02.05 from Research Genetics) which consists of 93 human/hamster hybrid cell lines. Genomic DNA from the cell lines was amplified using PCR primers specific for the human version of each novel IL-1 family gene. Products were separated by agarose gel electrophoresis and visualized by ethidium bromide staining. Each hybrid was scored in the following manner: 0 was assigned if there was clearly no amplification; 1 was assigned where there clearly was amplification; a score of 2 was assigned where the data was ambiguous. Scores were then submitted to the Whitehead Institute/MIT for chromosomal assignment and placement relative to known framework markers on the radiation hybrid map. Scores for each gene are as follows: FIL1δ, 100000010000000010001201001001200001101100001000000000101000010001120000000100010000100010100;FIL1ε, 101000010000100010001101121001100001101101001000001000101010021011110000001000010001100010100;FIL1ζ, 101000010000100010001201221001000001101101001000001000101010011021110000001000010001120010100;FIL1η, 122000200010000010000001001001000120001100201000000000101000001000220000001000010001100010100. Scores used for concomitant map placement of IL-1α, IL-1β, and IL-1ra were obtained from the NCBI (IL-1α, X02851;IL-1β, D20737 and AA150507; IL-1ra, H50548,R49297, and T72887).Expression AnalysisFirst-strand cDNAs present in CLONTECH(Palo Alto, CA) Human Multiple Tissue cDNA Panels I (catalog number K1420-1) and II (catalog number K1421-1) and the Human Immune Panel (catalog number K1426-1) were screened by PCR amplification using primers given in Table I. The primers were designed to span introns so that products arising from genomic DNA and cDNA could be distinguished. In some cases, nested primers were used in a second PCR reaction. The presence of an amplification product for each gene/tissue combination was determined by analysis on agarose gels stained with ethidium bromide.Table IPCR primer sequences used for analyzing expression of novel IL-1 family member mRNAMoleculePrimary or nestedSense/antiSequenceNo. cyclesAnneal °CFIL1δPrimarySenseGGGAGTCTACACCCTGTGGAGCTCAA3058FIL1δPrimaryAntisenseCTGCTGGAAGTAGAAGTCTGTGATGGFIL1δNestedSenseGGAGCTCAAGATGGTCCTGAGTGGGGCGCT3058FIL1δNestedAntisenseGCATTCCAGCCACCATTCTCGGGAAGCTFIL1εPrimarySenseGACACACCTCAGCAGGGGAGCATTCAGG4060FIL1εPrimaryAntisenseAACAGCATAGTTAACCCAAAGTCAGTAGFIL1ζPrimarySenseTGAGATCCTATGTCAGGCTGTGATAGG4060FIL1ζPrimaryAntisenseTGCTATGAGATTCCCAGAGTCCAGGACCFIL1ηPrimarySenseACATCATGAACCCACAACGGGAGGCAGCAC3560FIL1ηPrimaryAntisenseCTCTATCCTGGAACCAGCCACCCACAGCFIL1ηNestedSenseCCAAATCCTATGCTATTCGTGATTCTCGAC3558FIL1ηNestedAntisenseGGATTTATTCCACAGAATCTAAGTAGAAGOn some occasions, a second PCR reaction using nested primers was performed for FIL1δ and FIL1ε.

Immunol. 1999; 29: 3466-3477Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). In brief, NK cells were incubated with IL-12 (R & D Biosystems; 1 ng/ml) for either 2 or 4 h. T cells were unstimulated or stimulated with anti-CD3 (OKT-3 antibody, immobilized on plastic at 5 μg/ml) or with the combination of anti-CD3 and anti-CD28 (the anti-CD28 antibody was CK248, used in soluble form as a 1:500 dilution of ascites fluid), for 4 h. Monocytes were unstimulated, or stimulated with LPS (Sigma, 1 μg/ml) for 2 or 3 h. B cells were unstimulated, or stimulated with a combination of 005% SAC + 500 ng/ml CD40L trimer (Immunex) + 5 ng/ml IL-4 (Immunex) for 3.5 or 4 h. Dendritic cells were stimulated with LPS as for monocytes for 2 or 4 h. After isolation of RNA and synthesis of first-strand cDNA, PCR amplifications and gel analysis were performed as described above.Expression of Novel IL-1 Family Proteins for Receptor BindingNovel IL-1 family members, as well as control IL-1β and IL-18 molecules, were generated by transfection of expression vector constructs into COS cells using DEAE-dextran (35.Cosman D. Cerretti D.P. Larsen A. Park L. March C. Dower S. Gillis S. Urdal D. Nature. 1984; 312: 768-771Crossref PubMed Scopus (197) Google Scholar). Expression vectors used were pDC409 (36.Giri J.G. Ahdieh M. Eisenman J. Shanebeck K. Grabstein K. Kumaki S. Namen A. Park L.S. Cosman D. Anderson D. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 2822-2830Crossref PubMed Scopus (964) Google Scholar) for FIL1ε and FIL1ζ, or pDC412, a close relative, for FIL1δ and FIL1η. The unmodified open reading frames were used for FIL1δ, ε, and η. For FIL1ζ, the sequence beginning with Lys27 (KNLN. . . . . .) was fused downstream of the human immunoglobulin κ light chain signal peptide. IL-1β, with an ATG codon added to the N terminus of the mature form (beginning with Ala117), was expressed in pDC409. Human IL-18 was expressed as the mature form fused to the IL-7 signal peptide in the expression vector pDC206 (37.Kozlosky C.J. Maraskovsky E. McGrew J.T. VandenBos T. Teepe M. Lyman S.D. Srinivasan S. Fletcher F.A. Gayle III, R.B. Cerretti D.P. Beckmann M.P. Oncogene. 1995; 10: 299-306PubMed Google Scholar). For radiolabeling, 48 h after transfection cells were starved of cysteine and methionine for 60 min, then labeled with 70 μCi/ml of a [35S]cysteine/methionine mixture (Amersham; >1000 Ci/mmol) for 4–6 h. It is perhaps of interest that FIL1δ, FIL1ε, and FIL1η appear to be secreted from the COS cells despite the absence of either signal peptide or prodomain. C-terminal FLAG-tagged FIL1δ and -ε were partially purified from the conditioned medium using the tags, and their N termini sequenced. The N-terminal amino acid of the secreted FIL1ε was methionine 1; it had been modified by N-terminal acetylation. The N-terminal amino acid of the secreted FIL1δ is valine 2. Thus, there does not appear to have been cleavage of an unrecognized signal peptide or prodomain in either molecule. There are a number of proteins which, when transfected into COS cells, do not later appear in the medium, so this is not a general phenomenon attributable to leaky cells. However, the intracellular version of IL-1ra (icIL-1ra, a kind gift of William Arend, University of Colorado) also appears in the medium following transfection of COS cells. The significance of these findings is currently unknown.Receptor Binding AssaysThe novel IL-1 family members, present as35S-labeled proteins in conditioned medium from transfected COS cells, were tested for binding to Fc fusion proteins of the IL-1 receptor superfamily members (see Footnote 2 for general methods) 2Born, T. L., Morrison, L. A., Esteban, D. J., VandenBos, T., Thebeau, L. G., Chen, N., Spriggs, M. K., Sims, J. E., and Buller, M. L. (2000) J. Immunol., in press. IL-1R type I, IL-1R AcP, IL-1Rrp1, IL-1Rrp2, IL-1R AcPL, and T1/ST2 as follows: 0.5–1.0 ml of conditioned medium was pre-cleared for 2 h at 4 °C with 50 μl of protein G-Sepharose (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech; 50% solution in phosphate-buffered saline) containing 1% Triton X-100, 0.02% NaN3, and protease inhibitors (Roche Molecular Biochemicals catalog number 1 836 145). After a brief spin (3 min, 1000 rpm), the supernatant was transferred to a fresh tube and incubated overnight at 4 °C with 1 μg of receptor/Fc fusion protein plus another 50 μl of protein G-Sepharose. The mixture was centrifuged briefly, and the supernatant mixed with 0.5 ml of phosphate-buffered saline containing 5% glucose and protease inhibitors and spun again. The pellet was washed four times with 1 ml of a solution containing 0.4 m NaCl, 0.05% SDS, 1% Nonidet P-40, and protease inhibitors, and resuspended in 25 μl of 2 × reducing sample buffer (Zaxis, catalog number 220-2110106). Samples were run on 4–20% Tris glycine gels (Novex) and autoradiographed.RESULTSThe four previously known members of the IL-1 family (IL-1α, IL-1β, IL-1ra, and IL-18), while possessing a low overall fractional amino acid identity, share certain common amino acid sequence motifs, the most obvious of which can be summarized as F(X 10–12)FXS(AVS)XX(PE)XX(FY)(LI)(CAS)(TC) where X is any amino acid, and parentheses indicate that one of the included amino acids is present at that position. There are similarities in intron placement within the family as well. Relying on the sequence similarity, we searched public EST data bases and found sequences corresponding to three novel IL-1 family members, described below as FIL1δ, FIL1ε, and FIL1ζ. A fourth novel family member, described below as FIL1η, was originally revealed in a published patent application. Examination of the sequence (called IL-1δ by the inventors) in the patent application suggested that it was derived from an aberrantly spliced mRNA. We searched for and found an alternative form of mRNA that contains the conserved family sequence motif in the extreme 3′ exon. A brief description of the cloning and characteristics of each of the family members is given below. The sequences, and a comparison with the previously known IL-1 superfamily members, are given in Fig.1.FIL1δA search of GenBankTM revealed a murine EST, accession number W08205, that resembled the known IL-1s but was not identical to any. The IMAGE clone corresponding to the EST was sequenced and found to contain the entire open reading frame of an IL-1-like molecule. Unlike the known family members, this novel polypeptide (called FIL1δ) appeared to contain neither a signal peptide nor a prodomain at the N terminus. A human FIL1δ cDNA was then isolated from a human placenta cDNA library, using mouse FIL1δ as a probe. The human sequence predicted an open reading frame similar to that of mouse FIL1δ. Multiple FIL1δ cDNA clones from both species were subsequently isolated, and all had the same predicted open reading frame, with no evidence for isoforms containing either signal peptide or prodomain. Interestingly, among the cDNA clones from both species were found several different 5′-untranslated region sequences (data not shown). These different 5′ sequences appear to derive from separate exons, in that they can be found (separately) in genomic sequence upstream of the FIL1δ coding region, and have potential splice donor sites at their 3′ ends. Presumably theFIL1δ gene is transcribed from at least two promoters.FIL1εA later search of GenBankTM revealed a murine EST, accession number AA030324, that resembled a second novel IL-1 family member. Sequencing of the IMAGE clone corresponding to the EST showed an open reading frame that appeared to encode the C-terminal portion of an IL-1 molecule, but which could not be extended in the 5′ direction. The mouse sequence was used to probe a human genomic library, and a positive clone was identified and the insert sequenced. The sequence revealed a 212-base pair region with homology to the 3′-most exon of mouse FIL1ε. There was a potential splice acceptor site at the 5′ end of this region, and a stop codon at the 3′ end of the 70-amino acid open reading frame. More human genomic DNA to the 5′ side of this open reading frame was then isolated and sequenced, revealing three additional putative exons with sequence similarity to the mouse EST and to other IL-1 family members. On the assumption that the four putative exons were spliced to form a single coding region, PCR primers were designed and used successfully to amplify the predicted product from several different human RNA sources. As for FIL1δ, the predicted FIL1ε reading frame contains neither a signal peptide nor a prodomain.FIL1ζA third EST, accession number AI014548, was found in GenBankTM that appeared to encode an IL-1-like molecule. However, further sequencing revealed that the corresponding (human) IMAGE clone contained a stop codon upstream of the open reading frame but no initiating methionine. Screening of two other cDNA libraries resulted in isolation of a second, distinct aberrant clone, as well as a clone that contained an open reading frame that did begin with a methionine and that extended for 192 amino acids. This last clone was named FIL1ζ. Sequence comparison with other family members suggests that FIL1ζ has a prodomain of some 15–30 amino acids.Analysis of genomic DNA demonstrated that an intron lies between the nucleotides encoding the 23rd and 24th amino acids of the 192 amino acid open reading frame form (see Figs. 1 and4). The stop codon-containing sequences found in the aberrant cDNA clones lie within this intron, and appear to be incorporated into mRNA by cryptic splicing events. Since we had found three different cDNA isoforms for FIL1ζ, only one of which appeared to contain a functional open reading frame, it was important to determine the relative levels of the different transcripts. This was done by designing PCR primers that would amplify and distinguish the three isoforms, and using them to examine expression in a panel of first-strand cDNAs. The (presumably functional) FIL1ζ transcript was found in lymph node, thymus, bone marrow stroma, lung, testis, and placenta (Table II). We could not detect the form of mRNA represented by the EST in any tissue, whereas that represented by the other form of “aberrant” mRNA was present in bone marrow stroma (from which we had originally isolated it), lung, and placenta but not in the other tissues (not shown). The mRNA encoding that form appeared to be much less abundant than the functional FIL1ζ mRNA.Figure 4Intron positions. Intron positions were taken from GenBankTM (IL-1α, accession numberX03833; IL-1β, accession number X04500; IL-1ra, accession number X64532; IL-18, accession number E17138) or were determined for this paper by sequencing of genomic DNA (either directly cloned, or PCR amplified) and comparison to the cDNA sequences. The “intron 3,” “intron 4,” “intron 5” designations are by analogy with IL-1α andIL-1β, and"
https://openalex.org/W2010855976,"Previously, we identified a new mammalian sHSP, MKBP, as a myotonic dystrophy protein kinase-binding protein, and suggested its important role in muscle maintenance (Suzuki, A., Sugiyama, Y., Hayashi, Y., Nyu-i, N., Yoshida, M., Nonaka, I., Ishiura, S., Arahata, K., and Ohno, S. (1998) J. Cell Biol. 140, 1113–1124). In this paper, we develop the former work by performing extensive characterization of five of the six sHSPs so far identified, that is, HSP27, αB-crystallin, p20, MKBP/HSPB2, and HSPB3, omitting lens-specific αA-crystallin. Tissue distribution analysis revealed that although each sHSP shows differential constitutive expression in restricted tissues, tissues that express all five sHSPs are only muscle-related tissues. Especially, the expressions of HSPB3, identified for the first time as a 17-kDa protein in this paper, and MKBP/HSPB2 are distinctly specific to muscles. Moreover, these sHSPs form an oligomeric complex with an apparent molecular mass of 150 kDa that is completely independent of the oligomers formed by HSP27, αB-crystallin, and p20. The expressions of MKBP/HSPB2 and HSPB3 are induced during muscle differentiation under the control of MyoD, suggesting that the sHSP oligomer comprising MKBP/HSPB2 and HSPB3 represents an additional system closely related to muscle function. The functional divergence among sHSPs in different oligomers is also demonstrated in several ways: 1) an interaction with myotonic dystrophy protein kinase, which has been suggested to be important for the maintenance of myofibril integrity, was observed only for MKBP/HSPB2; 2) a myotube-specific association with actin bundles was observed for HSP27 and αB-crystallin, but not for MKBP/HSPB2; and 3) sHSPs whose mRNAs are induced by heat shock are αB-crystallin and HSP27. Taken together, the results suggest that muscle cells develop two kinds of stress response systems composed of diverged sHSP members, and that these systems work independently in muscle maintenance and differentiation. Previously, we identified a new mammalian sHSP, MKBP, as a myotonic dystrophy protein kinase-binding protein, and suggested its important role in muscle maintenance (Suzuki, A., Sugiyama, Y., Hayashi, Y., Nyu-i, N., Yoshida, M., Nonaka, I., Ishiura, S., Arahata, K., and Ohno, S.

Craig E.A. Annu. Rev. Genet. 1988; 22: 631-677Crossref PubMed Scopus (4418) Google Scholar). Considering that muscles are frequently subjected to severe conditions caused by heat, oxidative, and mechanical stresses, especially during exercise (2.Brooks G.A. Hittelman K.J. Faulkner J.A. Beyer R.E. Am. J. Physiol. 1971; 221: 427-431Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar), these HSPs may be especially important in this particular tissue. In fact, several HSPs, including HSP60, 70, and 90, have been shown to be induced after exhaustive exercise (3.Locke M. Noble E.G. Atkinson B.G. Am. J. Physiol. 1990; 258: C723-C729Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In addition, the inducible isoform of HSP70 has been shown to be constitutively expressed in a certain type of skeletal muscle fiber (4.Locke M. Noble E.G. Atkinson B.G. Am. J. Physiol. 1991; 261: C774-C779Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), suggesting that muscle cells are chronically ready to respond to frequent stresses. However, there have been limited numbers of studies that focus on HSPs in muscle cells. HSPs with low molecular masses of 15–30 kDa are called small heat shock proteins (sHSPs); they commonly share a homologous sequence of about 80 amino acids called the “α-crystallin domain” (5.Caspers G.J. Leunissen J.A. de Jong W.W. J. Mol. Evol. 1995; 40: 238-248Crossref PubMed Scopus (308) Google Scholar). Among mammalian sHSPs, HSP27 2Although the mouse and rat homologues of human HSP27 have been called HSP25, in this paper we standardize the protein name to HSP27 irrespective of species to avoid confusion. and αB-crystallin have been studied most intensely; they show chaperone-like activity in vitro (6.Horwitz J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 10449-10453Crossref PubMed Scopus (1745) Google Scholar, 7.Rajaraman K. Raman B. Rao Ch.M. J. Biol.

EMBO J. 1997; 16: 221-229Crossref PubMed Scopus (634) Google Scholar), and their expressions are induced in response to such diverse stimuli as heat shock, heavy metal exposure, and hypertonicity (9.Klemenz R. Frohli E. Steiger R.H. Schafer R. Aoyama A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 3652-3656Crossref PubMed Scopus (479) Google Scholar, 10.Head M.W. Corbin E. Goldman J.E. J. Cell. Physiol. 1994; 159: 41-50Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar). They confer stress resistance when overexpressed in cultured mammalian cells (11.Lavoie J.N. Gingras-Breton G. Tanguay R.M. Landry J. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 3420-3429Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 12.Iwaki T. Iwaki A. Tateishi J. Goldman J.E. J.

Immunol. 1995; 154: 363-374PubMed Google Scholar). The most interesting feature of their cytoprotective roles is that they are believed to act to stabilize cytoskeletal structures such as actin stress fibers and intermediate filaments (12.Iwaki T. Iwaki A. Tateishi J. Goldman J.E. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 125: 1385-1393Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar, 14.Lavoie J.N. Lambert H. Hickey E. Weber L.A. Landry J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 505-516Crossref PubMed Scopus (570) Google Scholar). Consistently, they are also suggested to interact with these cytoskeletal proteins in vitro (15.Miron T. Vancompernolle K. Vandekerckhove J. Wilchek M. Geiger B. J. Cell Biol. 1991; 114: 255-261Crossref PubMed Scopus (389) Google Scholar, 16.Bennardini F. Wrzosek A. Chiesi M. Circ.

Therefore, considering that muscle cells develop specific cytoskeletal structures based on actin and intermediate filaments (desmin), such as myofibrils, it is reasonable to speculate that HSP27 and αB-crystallin also play important roles in muscle maintenance. In fact, several studies have pointed out that these two sHSPs show abundant constitutive expression in skeletal muscle and heart (18.Kato K. Shinohara H. Kurobe N. Inaguma Y. Shimizu K. Ohshima K. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1991; 1074: 201-208Crossref PubMed Scopus (188) Google Scholar, 19.Kato K. Shinohara H. Goto S. Inaguma Y. Morishita R. Asano T. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 7718-7725Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Furthermore, their roles in organizing and protecting the myofibril structure have been suggested by the demonstration of their localization on specific sarcomeric structures such as Z- or I-bands, as well as their regulated expression during development or continuous contractile stimulation (20.Longoni S. Lattonen S. Bullock G. Chiesi M. Mol. Cell. Biochem. 1990; 97: 121-128Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar, 21.Lutsch G. Vetter R. Offhauss U. Wieske M. Grone H.J. Klemenz R. Schimke I.

Cell Biol. 1998; 75: 38-45Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). However, because of the relative ubiquitousness of their expression, most studies of HSP27 and αB-crystallin have been performed in non-muscle cells, and not enough attention has been paid to demonstrating the critical roles of sHSPs in muscle cells. Previously, we identified a novel sHSP, MKBP, as a binding protein for myotonic dystrophy protein kinase (DMPK), the protein product of the gene responsible for myotonic dystrophy (23.Suzuki A. Sugiyama Y. Hayashi Y. Nyu-i N. Yoshida M. Nonaka I. Ishiura S. Arahata K. Ohno S. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 140: 1113-1124Crossref PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar). This is the same protein as HSPB2, which was independently identified by Iwaki et al.(24.Iwaki A. Nagano T. Nakagawa M. Iwaki T. Fukumaki Y. Genomics. 1997; 45: 386-394Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar) as the protein product of a gene located in the 5′ upstream region of the αB-crystallin gene. We demonstrated that this MKBP/HSBP2 binds specifically to the kinase domain of DMPK, thus activating the kinase activity. MKBP/HSPB2 also shows a chaperone-like activity that protects the kinase from heat-induced inactivation. Importantly, the expression of MKBP/HSPB2, but not other sHSPs, is specifically up-regulated in the skeletal muscle of myotonic dystrophy patients as if to compensate for the reduced amount of DMPK. Together with the fact that DMPK knock-out mice develop a late-onset, progressive myopathy (25.Reddy S. Smith D.B. Rich M.M. Leferovich J.M. Reilly P. Davis B.M. Tran K. Rayburn H. Bronson R. Cros D. Balice-Gordon R.J. Housman D. Nat. Genet. 1996; 13: 325-335Crossref PubMed Scopus (288) Google Scholar), these findings led us to propose that this kinase is involved in a stress-response system in muscle cells by being a specific target of MKBP/HSPB2 (23.Suzuki A. Sugiyama Y. Hayashi Y. Nyu-i N. Yoshida M. Nonaka I. Ishiura S. Arahata K. Ohno S. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 140: 1113-1124Crossref PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar). Furthermore, because MKBP/HSPB2 itself is localized not only at the neuromuscular junction where DMPK is concentrated, but also at the Z-band of myofibrils, we speculated that MKBP/HSPB2 also contributes to the maintenance of myofibril integrity by interacting directly with myofibrils independent of DMPK. Interestingly, in muscle cytosol, MKBP/HSPB2 forms an oligomeric complex separate from that containing HSP27 and αB-crystallin. Therefore, our previous work, which provided the first example of a correlation between a particular muscular dystrophy and a stress-response system in muscle cells, also suggested the presence of muscle sHSPs systems that are more complicated than previously expected. Recently, the number of known mammalian sHSPs has rapidly risen to six (23.Suzuki A. Sugiyama Y. Hayashi Y. Nyu-i N. Yoshida M. Nonaka I. Ishiura S. Arahata K. Ohno S. J.

In this study, in an attempt to analyze the suggested sHSP systems in muscle cells, we carried out studies to characterize the five sHSPs expected to be expressed in muscles, that is, HSP27, αB-crystallin, p20, MKBP/HSPB2, and HSPB3. We first raised an antibody against HSPB3, the nucleotide sequence of which has been reported to be a possible novel mammalian sHSP (27.Lam W.Y. Wing Tsui S.K. Law P.T. Luk S.C. Fung K.P. Lee C.Y. Waye M.M. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1996; 1314: 120-124Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar, 28.Boelens W.C. Van Boekel M.A.M. De Jong W.W. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1998; 1388: 513-516Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar), and identified the protein product as a 17-kDa protein. We then used antibodies and cDNAs to examine the tissue distribution, transcriptional regulation, mutual interactions, and cellular localization of all five sHSPs in cultured muscle cells. Based on the results, we suggest that the sHSP family may have diverged to form two independent chaperone systems specific for muscle cells. Rat p20 and human HSPB3 cDNAs were amplified from a rat 3Y1 cell cDNA library (29.Izumi Y. Hirai S. Tamai Y. Fujise-Matsuoka A. Nishimura Y. Ohno S. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 7381-7389Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar) and a human skeletal muscle cDNA library (CLONTECH Laboratories, Inc., Palo Alto, CA), respectively, by PCR using appropriate synthetic oligonucleotide primers flanking the ORF of each protein. The preparation of the cDNAs for MKBP/HSPB2, αB-crystallin, and HSP27 has been described previously (23.Suzuki A. Sugiyama Y. Hayashi Y. Nyu-i N. Yoshida M. Nonaka I. Ishiura S. Arahata K. Ohno S. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 140: 1113-1124Crossref PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar). For the expression of HSPB3 in COS1 cells, we constructed an expression vector, HSPB3/SRD, by inserting a 0.64-kb fragment of an HSPB3 cDNA clone (GenBank accession numberU15590) containing 0.17 kb of the 5′-untranslated region and the whole ORF up to the predicted stop codon into an SRD mammalian expression vector (30.Ohno S. Akita Y. Konno Y. Imajoh S. Suzuki K. Cell. 1988; 53: 731-741Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (299) Google Scholar). Anti-human HSPB3 rabbit polyclonal antiserum was generated using a glutathione S-transferase-HSPB fusion protein as an antigen. Anti-human MKBP (c-2) and anti-rat p20 polyclonal antibodies have been reported previously (23.Suzuki A. Sugiyama Y. Hayashi Y. Nyu-i N. Yoshida M. Nonaka I. Ishiura S. Arahata K. Ohno S. J.

Chem. 1994; 269: 15302-15309Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The antibodies were affinity purified prior to use. The anti-αB-crystallin polyclonal antibody was purchased from Chemicon International Inc. (Temecula, CA), while the anti-HSP25 polyclonal antibody and anti-rat HSC70 polyclonal antibody were from StressGen Biotechnologies Corp. (British Columbia, Canada). The anti-human HSP27 monoclonal antibody and the anti-mouse desmin monoclonal antibody were purchased from Affinity Bioreagents Inc. (Colden, CO) andZymed Laboratories Inc. (San Francisco, CA), respectively. The tissue distribution of each sHSP mRNA was analyzed using a set of Human Multiple-tissue Northern blot membranes (CLONTECH). Total RNA from cultured cells was prepared using a Quick Prep Total RNA Extraction kit (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). cDNA fragments corresponding to the whole ORF of each sHSP were radiolabeled with [α-32P]dCTP (1 × 106 cpm/ml) and used to probe membranes to which the RNAs were blotted as described previously (23.Suzuki A. Sugiyama Y. Hayashi Y. Nyu-i N. Yoshida M. Nonaka I. Ishiura S. Arahata K. Ohno S. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 140: 1113-1124Crossref PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar). The probes for myogenin and muscle creatine kinase were prepared as described previously (31.Yoshida S. Fujisawa-Sehara A. Taki T. Arai K. Nabeshima Y. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 132: 181-193Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). Hybridization was performed using ExpressHyb™ Hybridization Solution (CLONTECH) according to the manufacturer's instructions. The membranes were washed two times at 50 °C for 20 min except for MKBP/HSPB2, which was washed at 53 °C. Autoradiography was carried out at −70 °C on Kodak x-ray film. When reprobing the membranes, the remaining radioactivity was removed by incubating the membranes in 5 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 2 mm EDTA, 0.1% SDS at 100 °C for 10 min; radioactivity was confirmed to be negligible before the next hybridization. RT-PCR was performed using Ready-To-Go RT-PCR beads (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) according to the manufacturer's instructions. The primer sets for the mouse sHSPs were as follows: ATGTCGGGCCGCACAGTGCC and CCTTCTCCGAAGCGCTGC for MKBP/HSPB2, ACTATGGCAAAAATCATTTTGAGG and CTTCTCCGTGGAGGCTGAGT for HSPB3 (designed based on the published mouse EST sequence), ATGGACATCGCCATCCACCAC and TCTGAGAGTCCGGTGTC for αB-crystallin, and ACTGGGCATGGCCTTCCGTGT and TTACTCCTTGGAGGCCATGT for glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase. Bait and prey plasmids were constructed by subcloning the whole ORF of each sHSP into pGBT9 or pGAD10 (CLONTECH Laboratories, Inc.), respectively, and an appropriate set of plasmids was simultaneously transformed into the yeast indicator strain HF7C by standard methods (32.Gietz D. St. Jean A. Woods R.A. Schiestl R.H. Nucleic Acids Res. 1992; 20: 1425Crossref PubMed Scopus (2895) Google Scholar). After 4 days of growth at 30 °C on selective culture plates lacking tryptophan and leucine, double transformants were replated onto histidine-lacking plates containing 10 mm 3-aminotriazole to examine the interaction of the introduced proteins. The results were also confirmed by examining the β-galactosidase activity of each clone with a standard filter assay method. A subclone of C2C12 mouse myoblast (clone C2/4) was used in this study (33.Yoshida N. Yoshida S. Koishi K. Masuda K. Nabeshima Y. J. Cell Sci. 1998; 111: 769-779Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). C3H10T1/2 (clone 8) was purchased from American Type Culture Collection and 10TflagMyoD cells were generated by transfecting the pME-flagMyoD expression vector together with pSV2neo (34.Takebe Y. Seiki M. Fujisawa J. Hoy P. Yokota K. Arai K. Yoshida M. Arai N. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1988; 8: 466-472Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). All cells were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum, with 400 μg/ml G418 added in the case of 10TflagMyoD. Differentiation was induced by culturing the cells on type I collagen-coated tissue culture plates (Iwaki, Tokyo), and then switching the cells to serum-free ITS medium consisting of Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10 μg/ml insulin, 5 μg/ml transferrin, 10 nmol of selenite (Life Technologies, Inc., Grand Island, NY). For heat treatment, the cells were exposed to transitory heat shock by floating them on a water at appropriate temperatures for 15–60 min; the cells were then recovered by culturing at 37 °C for appropriate times before harvest. Ten-week-old SD rats were fasted overnight and killed under ether anesthesia or by cardioectomy. Organs and tissues were excised and washed with ice-cold PBS, frozen immediately in liquid nitrogen, and then crushed into a powder with a CRYO-PRESS (Diatron, Ltd., Tokyo, Japan) precooled in liquid nitrogen. The powders were suspended in 10 volumes (v/w) of SDS sample buffer (2% SDS, 1 mm EDTA, 70 mmTris-HCl, pH 6.7, 10% glycerol, 125 mm 2-mercaptoethanol, 0.02% bromphenol blue), homogenized with a POLYTRON homogenizer (KINEMATICA AG, Littau/Luzern, Switzerland), and sonicated. A human skeletal muscle extract was prepared by similarly processing a small block of frozen limb muscle (biceps bracii) obtained for diagnostic purposes with informed consent. The samples were heat-denatured at 100 °C for 5 min. Total protein concentrations in the samples were determined by spotting aliquots of each sample onto nitrocellulose membranes (Hybond-C extra, Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) and staining with Coomassie Brilliant Blue. The stained spots were quantified densitometrically using bovine serum albumin as a standard. The amounts of each sHSP in a certain volume of human skeletal muscle solubilized as described above were estimated by Western blot analysis based on standard data obtained using purified recombinant human sHSPs. The frozen rat skeletal or cardiac muscle powders were suspended in 10 volumes (v/w) of lysis buffer (20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 100 mm NaCl, 5 mm EDTA, 5 mm EGTA, 10 mm MgCl2, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 10 μg/ml leupeptin, 0.5 mm dithiothreitol) and homogenized by 10 strokes of a Dounce homogenizer. The lysates were centrifuged at 130,000 × g for 40 min at 4 °C, and the supernatants were loaded onto a prepacked Superose 12 (HR10/30) column equilibrated with buffer (20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, 2 mm EGTA, 10 mmMgCl2, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 10 μg/ml leupeptin, 0.5 mm dithiothreitol) at 4 °C. The molecular mass standards used were thyroglobulin (669 kDa), apoferritin (440 kDa), β-amylase (200 kDa), bovine γ-globulin (158 kDa), bovine serum albumin (67 kDa), chicken ovalbumin (45 kDa), and carbonic anhydrase (29 kDa). Fifteen microliters of Protein A-Sepharose (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) was combined with 2 μg of affinity-purified anti-MKBP/HSPB2 or anti-p20 IgG, and incubated for 1 h at 4 °C with total rat muscle extracts (150 μl) or fractions obtained by gel filtration (260 μl). Bovine serum albumin, 0.1% (w/v), was added to the solutions to block nonspecific binding. The resins were washed five times with lysis buffer containing 0.5% Triton X-100. Immune complexes were eluted by agitating the resins vigorously in 100 μl of 0.2 m glycine-HCl, pH 2.5, for 15 min at 4 °C. The supernatant was neutralized with a small aliquot of Tris-HCl, pH 9.0, and mixed with 50 μl of 3 × SDS sample buffer. One-dimensional SDS-PAGE (12 or 15% polyacrylamide) was performed according to the method of Laemmli (35.Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (207218) Google Scholar). The separated proteins were transferred onto polyvinylidene fluoride membranes (Millipore Corp., Bedford, MA) which were then soaked in 5% skimmed milk. Immunoblots were processed for immunoreaction as described previously (36.Suzuki A. Yoshida M. Ozawa E. J. Cell Biol. 1995; 128: 373-381Crossref PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar), and visualized by a chemiluminescence ECL system (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). C2C12 cells were fixed directly on collagen-coated dishes using 3% formaldehyde in PBS for 30 min at room temperature, and permeabilized with 0.1% Triton X-100 in PBS for 15 min. Detergent extraction was performed by treating the cells with extraction buffer (10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 5 mmMgCl2, 10 mm NaCl, 0.1 mmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 0.5% Triton X-100) for 10 min on ice prior to fixation. The dishes were soaked in PBS containing 10% calf serum, cracked into several pieces, and treated with primary antibodies for 45 min at 37 °C in a moist chamber. The samples were washed three times with PBS containing 0.1% Tween 20, then similarly incubated with BODIPY-conjugated goat anti-rabbit IgG antibody (Molecular Probes, Inc., Eugene, OR). After washing, the cells were mounted with VECTASHIELD (Vector Laboratories, Inc., Barlingame, CA) and observed and photographed digitally under a fluorescence microscope (Olympus BX-50) equipped with a cooled CCD camera (Photometrics, East Britannia Drive, Tucson, AZ). Among the six members of the mammalian sHSP family so far reported, HSPL27 is the only one that has not been identified at the protein level (27.Lam W.Y. Wing Tsui S.K. Law P.T. Luk S.C. Fung K.P. Lee C.Y. Waye M.M. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1996; 1314: 120-124Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). Several errors in the nucleotide sequence of the HSPL27 cDNA were recently corrected in the data base to predict an ORF with 150 amino acids corresponding to a protein with an estimated molecular mass of 16,965 kDa (GenBank accession number U15590). Because this is identical to the sequence of HSPB3 published by Boelens et al. (28.Boelens W.C. Van Boekel M.A.M. De Jong W.W. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1998; 1388: 513-516Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar) as a corrected version of the HSPL27 cDNA, we also use HSPB3 as a revised name for HSPL27, according to the suggestion of the HUGO Human Gene Nomenclature Committee. To confirm the expression of endogenous HSPB3, we raised an anti-HSPB3 rabbit polyclonal antibody using a recombinant protein as an antigen, and detected a band with the predicted 17 kDa mass in human skeletal muscle (Fig. 3 a). The migration of this band was identical to that of the protein product of the HSPB3 cDNA ectopically expressed in COS1 cells (Fig. 3 a, lane 6; see “Experimental Procedures”). Therefore, we conclude that the corrected amino acid sequence for HSPB3 represents a novel sHSP with a molecular mass of 17 kDa expressed in vivo. Northern blot analysis of the poly(A)+ RNA from human tissues (Fig.2 a) revealed a consistent 0.84-kb transcript for HSPB3 specifically in skeletal muscle and heart (see below), although longer exposure produced an extremely faint band of 3.7-kb in the same tissues.Figure 2Northern blot analysis of the expression of each sHSP mRNA in various adult human tissues. A set of Human Multiple Northern blots (CLONTECH) was used, in which each lane was loaded with 2 μg of poly(A)+ RNA isolated from the indicated tissues. a, HSPB3 cDNA hybridizes to a 0.84-kb mRNA specifically expressed in skeletal muscle and heart. The probe cDNA corresponds to the region encoding the N-terminal region preceding the α-crystallin domain. Note that it also detects a faint band of 3.7 kb in the same tissues. The same results were obtained using a cDNA fragment encoding the whole ORF of the protein (part of the result is shown in b).b, comparison of the tissue specificity of the expression of each sHSP. The same blots were repeatedly probed with a succession of different cDNA fragments corresponding to the whole ORF of each sHSP (see “Experimental Procedures”). To demonstrate the relative ubiquitousness of αB-crystallin expression, another result obtained at longer exposure is also shown for this sHSP alone at thebottom of the panel. See the text for details.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) The alignment of the amino acid sequence of human HSPB3 with those of the other human sHSPs so far identified revealed it to be the most diverged member of the family (28.Boelens W.C. Van Boekel M.A.M. De Jong W.W. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1998; 1388: 513-516Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar), showing ∼40% amino acid identity in the α-crystallin domain (Fig.1 a), which is the most highly conserved region among family members (5.Caspers G.J. Leunissen J.A. de Jong W.W. J. Mol. Evol. 1995; 40: 238-248Crossref PubMed Scopus (308) Google Scholar). In addition, it shows no similarity in the N-terminal region (hatched bar in Fig.1 b) where another short conserved stretch is detected in other family members. As a first step in investigating the physiological functions of mammalian sHSPs, we performed comparative studies of their tissue distributions by Northern blot as well as Western blot analyses. Although there have been several studies in which the tissue distributions of three sHSPs, HSP27, αB-crystallin, and p20, were examined individually (18.Kato K. Shinohara H. Kurobe N. Inaguma Y.

The LGBP was purified by chromatography on Blue-Sepharose and phenyl-Sepharose, followed by Sephacryl S-200. The LGBP has a molecular mass of 36 kDa and 40 kDa on 10% SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis under reducing and nonreducing conditions, respectively. The calculated mass of LGBP is 39,492 Da, which corresponds to the native size of LGBP; the estimated pI of the mature LGBP is 5.80. LGBP has binding activity to lipopolysaccharides as well as to β-1,3-glucans such as laminarin and curdlan, but peptidoglycan could not bind to LGBP. Cloning and sequencing of LGBP showed significant homology with several putative Gram-negative bacteria-binding proteins and β-1,3-glucanases. Interestingly, LGBP also has a structure and functions similar to those of the coelomic cytolytic factor-1, a lipopolysaccharide- and glucan-binding protein from the earthworm Eisenia foetida. To evaluate the involvement of LGBP in the prophenoloxidase (proPO) activating system, a polyclonal antibody against LGBP was made and used for the inhibition of phenoloxidase (PO) activity triggered by the β-1,3-glucan laminarin in the hemocyte lysate of crayfish. The PO activity was blocked completely by the anti-LGBP antibody. Moreover, the PO activity could be recovered by the addition of purified LGBP. These results suggest that the 36-kDa LGBP plays a role in the activation of the proPO activating system in crayfish and thus seems to play an important role in the innate immune system of crayfish.

In the case of humans, monocytes and macrophages respond to LPS by inducing the expression of cytokines, cell adhesion proteins, and enzymes involved in the production of small proinflammatory mediators. Under pathophysiological conditions, LPS exposure can lead to an often fatal syndrome known as septic shock (4.Parillo J.E. N. Engl. J. Med. 1993; 328: 1471-1477Crossref PubMed Scopus (1503) Google Scholar).

For instance, in the horseshoe crab Tachypleus tridentatus, LPS or β-1,3-glucans both bind specifically to pattern recognition proteins, and as a result the coagulation cascade is activated (24.Muta T.

Kadotani T. Yaoi K. Iwashana H. Sato R. FEBS Lett. 1999; 443: 139-143Crossref PubMed Scopus (165) Google Scholar) have already been reported as special biological properties of pattern recognition proteins. In particular, the proPO system is an important non-self-recognition system in invertebrates which can be activated by LPS or peptidoglycan from bacteria and β-1,3-glucans from fungi (2.Söderhäll K. Cerenius L. Curr. Opin. Immunol. 1998; 10: 23-28Crossref PubMed Scopus (1102) Google Scholar). Non-self-molecules are recognized by endogenous pattern recognition proteins and their receptors, and then they cause activation of the proPO system (2.Söderhäll K. Cerenius L. Curr. Opin. Immunol. 1998; 10: 23-28Crossref PubMed Scopus (1102) Google Scholar). The active form of proPO, phenoloxidase (PO), is produced by a serine proteinase known as the proPO-activating enzyme. Subsequently, PO oxidizes DOPA to dopaquinone, which is converted to melanin through several non-enzymatic steps. The generated PO plays an important role as it can melanize pathogens (2.Söderhäll K. Cerenius L. Curr. Opin. Immunol. 1998; 10: 23-28Crossref PubMed Scopus (1102) Google Scholar), sclerotize the cuticle (40.Sugumaran M. FEBS Lett. 1991; 295: 233-239Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar), and heal wounds (41.Lai-Fook J. J. Insect Physiol. 1996; 12: 195-226Crossref Scopus (94) Google Scholar) in invertebrates. Since proPO was first cloned from the crayfish P. leniusculus (42.Aspán A. Huang T.-s. Cerenius L. Söderhäll K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 939-943Crossref PubMed Scopus (229) Google Scholar), a large number of invertebrate proPOs have been structurally determined, and recently, the primary structure of proPO-activating enzyme has been reported from three different insects (43.Lee S.Y. Cho M.Y. Hyun J.H. Lee K.M. Homma K. Natori S. Kawabata S.I. Iwanaga S. Lee B.L. Eur. J. Biochem. 1998; 257: 615-621Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar, 44.Jiang H. Wang Y. Kanost M.R. Proc.

However, so far only two groups have reported that a LPS- and β-GBP, the coelomic cytolytic factor-1, from the earthworm Eisenia foetida (27.Beschin A. Bilej M. Hanssens F. Raymarkers J. Van Dyck E.

Chem. 1996; 271: 13854-13860Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (400) Google Scholar) appear to be involved in the activation of the proPO system. In this paper, we describe the purification of a LPS- and β-1,3-glucan-binding protein (LGBP) from crayfish blood cells, its cDNA cloning, and its role in the proPO system of the crayfishP. leniusculus. Freshwater crayfish, P. leniusculus, were purchased from Berga Kräftodling, Södermanland, Sweden, and kept in an aquarium with tap water at 10 °C. Only intermoult male crayfish were used in these experiments. Hemocyte lysate supernatant (HLS) was prepared by collecting hemolymph from 200 crayfish in anticoagulant buffer (0.14 m NaCl, 0.1 m glucose, 30 mm trisodium citrate, 26 mm citric acid, 10 mm EDTA, pH 4.6) (46.Leonard C. Söderhäll K. Ratcliffe N.A. Insect Biochem. 1985; 15: 803-810Crossref Scopus (173) Google Scholar). The hemocytes were spun down at 4 °C and 800 × g for 10 min, and then the hemocytes were homogenized with CAC buffer (10 mm sodium cacodylate, 0.1 m CaCl2, pH 6.5). After centrifugation at 4 °C and 25,000 × g for 30 min, the supernatant was applied to a Blue-Sepharose CL-6B column (1 × 12 cm), previously equilibrated with CAC buffer. The flow-through containing LGBP was collected, and it was loaded to a phenyl-Sepharose CL-4B (1 × 4 cm) equilibrated with CAC buffer and washed with the same buffer. Bound proteins were eluted with 65% ethylene glycol in CAC buffer. The eluted proteins were concentrated on a Centricon concentration filter (Amicon, Inc.) to a final volume of 0.5 ml. As a final purification step, Sephacryl S-200 gel filtration column (0.8 × 100 cm) equilibrated with CAC buffer was used. 10% SDS-PAGE was carried out by the method of Laemmli (47.Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (207233) Google Scholar). Samples were denatured by heating them for 4 min at 95 °C in 2% (w/v) SDS and 0.1% dithiothreitol, and then the gels were stained according to the method of Fairbank et al.(48.Fairbank G. Steck T.L. Wallach D.L.H. Biochemistry. 1971; 10: 2606-2617Crossref PubMed Scopus (6175) Google Scholar). A low molecular mass calibration kit for electrophoresis (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) was used for size markers: rabbit muscle phosphorylase b (94 kDa), bovine serum albumin (67 kDa), egg white ovalbumin (43 kDa), bovine erythrocyte carbonic anhydrase (30 kDa), soybean trypsin inhibitor (20.1 kDa), and bovine milk α-lactalbumin (14.4 kDa). The purified LGBP was separated by 10% SDS-PAGE under reducing conditions. After Coomassie Blue staining, a band corresponding to LGBP was excised and homogenized in phosphate-buffered saline. Antibody against LGBP was raised by three injections of 20 μg of purified LGBP each time with Freund's adjuvant (complete for the first injection, incomplete for the other two injections). To purify the antibody to be used for immunoblotting experiment, the purified LGBP was electrophoresed and transferred onto a nitrocellulose membrane. The region of LGBP on the filter was excised and treated with 5% skim milk in 20 mm Tris/HCl, pH 7.9, at 4 °C for 1 h and then incubated in 2-fold dilution anti-LGBP antiserum with rinse solution containing 10 mm Tris/HCl, pH 7.9, 150 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 0.1% Triton X-200, 1% NaN3, and 0.5% skim milk at 4 °C for 12 h with gentle shaking. The strip was washed carefully with rinse solution and subsequently cut into pieces. The antibody bound to LGBP was eluted with 0.2 m glycine HCl, pH 2.8, and then the eluted antibody solution was neutralized immediately with 1m KOH, and bovine serum albumin (BSA) was added to a final concentration of 0.1%. To purify the antibody for PO activity test, the anti-LGBP antiserum was loaded to protein A-Sepharose CL-4B equilibrated with 50 mm Tris/HCL, pH 7.0, and washed with the same buffer. Bound anti-LGBP antibody was eluted with 0.1m glycine HCl, pH 2.8. The eluted anti-LGBP antibody was concentrated on a Centricon concentration filter. For immunoblotting, the proteins were subjected to 10% SDS-PAGE under reducing conditions and electrotransferred to nitrocellulose membranes in transfer buffer (25 mm Tris/HCl, 190 mmglycine, 20% MeOH) for 2 h at 280 mA on ice. All of the following steps were performed at room temperature. The membrane was subsequently blocked in TTBS (0.1% Tween 20 in 20 mm Tris/HCl, 150 mm NaCl, pH 7.4) containing 3% BSA for 1 h and incubated with antibody in TTBS containing 0.1% BSA for 1 h 30 min. A 2,000-fold dilution of affinity-purified antibody was used in immunoblotting. Then the membrane was washed with TTBS once for 15 min and three times for 5 min. The anti-rabbit IgG peroxidase-conjugated IgG diluted 1:10,000 with TTBS containing 0.1% BSA was incubated for 1 h, washed with TTBS once for 15 min and four times for 5 min. For detection, the enhanced chemiluminescence (ECL) Western blotting reagent kit (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) was used. To determine the internal amino acid sequence of peptide fragments of LGBP, the protein was subjected to 10% SDS-PAGE under reducing conditions, stained with 0.2% Coomassie Blue in 50% methanol, and destained with 30% methanol. The band corresponding to LGBP was excised and treated with lysyl endopeptidase according to Wilm et al. (49.Wilm M. Shevchenko A. Houthaeve T. Breit S. Schweigerer L. Fotsis T. Mann M. Nature. 1996; 379: 466-469Crossref PubMed Scopus (1507) Google Scholar). The resulting digest was subjected to reverse phase high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC, Pharmacia Smart chromatography system) using a phase μRPC C2/C18 column (MIC-15-03-MRP, Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). The HPLC was performed with a linear gradient of 0–50% acetonitrile in 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid for 75 min at a flow rate of 30 μl/min, and the most prominent peaks were sequenced using an Applied Biosystem 476A sequencer. For determination of the NH2-terminal amino acid sequence, the protein was electrotransferred onto a polyvinylidene difluoride membrane. The membrane was stained with Coomassie Blue, destained, washed with distilled water, and dried. The LGBP band was cut into small pieces and subjected to an Applied Biosystem 476A automated protein sequencer for amino acid sequencing. Fluorescein isothiocyanate-labeled LPS (smooth types) from Salmonella abortus (Sigma) and smooth types of LPS fromEscherichia coli serotype 055:B5 (Sigma) were used for LPS binding activity of LGBP. Microtiter 96-well plates were coated with purified LGBP (200 μl/well of 10 μg/ml in CAC buffer, pH 6.5) overnight at 4 °C. Excess binding sites were blocked with 1% BSA in CAC buffer at 37 °C for 2 h. The same concentration (10 μg) of BSA was used as control. After washing three times with CAC buffer, different doses of fluorescein isothiocyanate-labeled LPS were added in 100 μl of CAC buffer containing 0.1% BSA, incubated for 3 h at 37 °C, and then the plates were washed three times with CAC buffer. 100 μl/well 50 mm Tris/HCl containing 50 mmNaCl, pH 8.5, was added for measuring the bound fluorescence using a fluorescence multiwell plate reader (Wallac 1420 multilabel counter) at emission/excitation 485 nm/530 nm. This experiment was repeated twice with similar results. In another method, curdlan, a linear polymer of glucose units linked with β-1,3-linkages (Wako), laminarin, which consists of β-1,3-glucan chain with occasional β-1,6-linked glucose units (Calbiochem), peptidoglycan of Staphylococcus aureus(Fluka), or LPS of E. coli serotype 055:B5 (Sigma) was used for testing binding activity to LGBP. 4 μg of purified LGBP was incubated with 100 μg of curdlan, laminarin, LPS, or peptidoglycan in CAC buffer for 1 h at 4 °C. The supernatant was taken, and the pellets of curdlan, laminarin, LPS, or peptidoglycan were washed three times with CAC buffer. The bound protein was eluted with 30 μl of SDS-PAGE sample loading buffer (60 mm Tris/HCl, pH 6.8, containing 2% SDS, 1% glycerol, 0.01% bromphenol blue, and 0.1% dithiothreitol) and treated by heating at 95 °C for 4 min. The supernatant was treated by trichloroacetic acid for protein precipitation. The precipitated proteins were dissolved with 30 μl of SDS-PAGE sample loading buffer. To investigate LGBP binding activity to LPS, β-1,3-glucans, or peptidoglycan, the eluted proteins and the supernatants were applied to 10% SDS-PAGE and subsequently developed for immunoblotting using anti-LGBP antibody as a probe. Six pairs of nested degenerate primers were synthesized according to amino acid sequences of four lysyl endopeptidase-derived peptide fragments of LGBP. Two cDNA fragments, both coding for LGBP, were amplified by polymerase chain reaction from the crayfish hemocyte cDNA library using each combination of 12 degenerate primers, one of which was labeled with [α-32P]dCTP by random priming using the Megaprime labeling kit (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) and was used as a probe to screen more LGBP-specific clones. From an initial screening of approximately 120,000 recombinants of the crayfish hemocyte cDNA library λ-phage resulted in more than 300 positive clones. The largest one that was identified by restriction enzyme digestion was cultured and amplified, and the recombinant DNA was purified by using Wizard λ preparation DNA purification system (Promega). The insert was digested out by the restriction enzyme EcoRI (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) and subcloned into EcoRI-digested pBluescript II (SK+) plasmid (Stratagene). It was subsequently sequenced in double strands by an Applied Biosystems PRISM dye terminator cycle sequencing ready reaction kit (Perkin-Elmer). The cDNA sequence was analyzed with the MacVector 4.1.4 software (Kodak). The nucleotide sequence, and the deduced amino acid sequence was compared with the BLAST program (National Center Biotechnology International, Bethesda, MD). Total RNA was extracted from crayfish hemocytes by using Trizol LS reagent (Life Technologies) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Approximately 20 μg of total RNA was fractionated on a 1% agarose gel in the presence of formaldehyde and transferred to a nylon membrane (Hybond-N, Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) by capillary blotting following standard procedures. The 0.24–9.5-kilobase RNA ladder (Life Technologies) was electrophoresed simultaneously and stained with ethidium bromide. The cDNA probes, spanning the coding region and 3′-untranslated region, respectively, were labeled with [α-32P]dCTP using the Megaprime labeling kit (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). Northern blot hybridization was performed overnight at 65 °C in a solution composed of 5 × SSC, 5 × Denhardt's solution, 0.5% (w/v) SDS, and 100 μg/ml denatured salmon sperm DNA. The membrane was subsequently washed twice with 2 × SSC and 0.1% SDS at room temperature for 10 min, once with 1 × SSPE and 0.1% SDS at 65 °C for 15 min, and finally twice with 0.5 × SSC and 0.1% SDS at 65 °C for 10 min. The washed membrane was used for autoradiography. To confirm the involvement of LGBP in the crayfish proPO system, a polyclonal antibody against LGBP was used, and PO activity was assayed according to Aspán and Söderhäll. (50.Aspán A. Söderhäll K. Insect Biochem. 1991; 21: 363-373Crossref Scopus (134) Google Scholar). Briefly, 30 μg of HLS was incubated for 1 h at 4 °C with different concentrations of anti-LGBP antibody purified by protein A column chromatography and 10 μg of l-DOPA (3-(3,4-dihydroxylphenyl)-l-alanine). These mixtures were incubated at room temperature for 5 h in a final volume of 30 μl of 30 mm sodium cacodylate, pH 6.5, with or without 10 μg of laminarin, curdlan, LPS, or peptidoglycan. The oxidation ofl-DOPA was measured at 490 nm. For reconstitution of PO activity, 3 μg or 15 μg of purified LGBP, previously incubated with laminarin for 20 min at room temperature, was incubated with HLS, in which PO activity had been previously inhibited by addition of anti-LGBP antibody. The recovered PO activity was measured after addition of l-DOPA by spectrophotometry at 490 nm. The concentration of protein was measured with the Bradford method (51.Bradford M.M. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 72: 248-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (216440) Google Scholar), using BSA as a standard protein. LGBP was purified from crayfish hemocytes. The hemocyte lysate of crayfish was first subjected to a Blue-Sepharose column chromatography, and the flow-through fraction, containing LGBP, was then purified by hydrophobic chromatography on phenyl-Sepharose followed by gel filtration on Sephacryl S-200 (Fig.1 A). The purity of LGBP in the different fractions was ascertained by SDS-PAGE (Fig. 1 B). Hemocyte lysate supernatants from 200 crayfish with a protein content of about 35 mg of protein gave 210 μg of purified LGBP. The purified LGBP ran as a single band of approximately 36 kDa and 40 kDa in 10% SDS-PAGE under reducing and nonreducing conditions, respectively (Fig.2, A and B).Figure 2SDS-PAGE of purified LGBP and immunoblotting analysis. 2 μg of LGBP was precipitated with trichloroacetic acid and then subjected to SDS-PAGE. Panel A, 10% SDS-PAGE of purified LGBP under reducing conditions; panel B, 10% SDS-PAGE of purified LGBP under nonreducing conditions; panel C, immunoblotting used for localization of LGBP.

Fig. 2 C shows that the anti-LGBP antibody could recognize LGBP in hemocytes but not in plasma. This result suggests that LGBP exists only in the hemocytes. Two different methods were used for testing the binding activity of purified LGBP to LPS, β-1,3-glucans, or peptidoglycan. First, to examine the LPS binding activity fluorescein isothiocyanate-labeled LPS was used, and 10 μg of purified LGBP was immobilized to microtiter plates. When the fluorescence intensity of LGBP was compared with that of control BSA fluorescence intensity, the binding activity of LGBP to LPS was gradually increased in a dose-dependent manner (Fig. 3). This result shows that LGBP exhibits LPS binding activity. In a second approach, the purified LGBP was incubated with curdlan, laminarin, LPS, or peptidoglycan to demonstrate the binding activity of LGBP. Fig.4 shows the result of an immunoblot of the corresponding LGBP binding activity to curdlan, laminarin, LPS, or peptidoglycan. In the pellets, LGBP is shown to bind strongly to LPS and curdlan, less to laminarin (lanes 2, 3, and4 in Fig. 4), and not at all to peptidoglycan (lane 5). LGBP could not be found in the supernatants that were incubated with LPS, laminarin, or curdlan, (lanes 6,7, and 8 in Fig. 4), whereas the supernatant solution of peptidoglycan showed a 36-kDa LGBP band (lane 9). These results clearly show th"

This process must be tightly regulated since there are no distinct mechanisms for the excretion of excess iron from the body. An insight into the cellular mechanisms has recently been provided by expression cloning of a divalent cation transporter (DCT1) from rat duodenum and positional cloning of its human homologue, Nramp2. Here we demonstrate that Nramp2 is expressed in the apical membrane of the human intestinal epithelial cell line, Caco 2 TC7, and is associated with functional iron transport in these cells with a substrate preference for iron over other divalent cations. Iron transport occurs by a proton-dependent mechanism, exhibiting a concurrent intracellular acidification. Taken together, these data suggest that the expression of the Nramp2 transporter in human enterocytes may play an important role in intestinal iron absorption.

As a consequence, nature has developed an array of elaborate processes for the absorption, storage, and transport of iron within the body, and a homeostatic balance between these mechanisms is essential for good health. The vast majority of dietary non-heme iron is absorbed in the duodenum, where it is most soluble due to the acidic environment. Bioavailable iron is always in the ferrous (Fe2+) state, but most ingested iron is in the ferric (Fe3+) form. Reduction of Fe3+ to Fe2+ can be promoted by the action of a putative ferric reductase (1.Raja K.B. Simpson R.J. Peters T.J. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1992; 1135: 141-146Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar) and reducing components in the diet, such as ascorbate (2.Han O. Failla M.L. Hill A.D. Morris E.R. Smith J.C. J. Nutr. 1995; 125: 1291-1299PubMed Google Scholar). The regulation of iron absorption from the diet by the small intestine is of crucial importance in determining body iron status, and consequently, a great deal of research interest has focused on the cellular mechanisms involved in iron accumulation. This has culminated in the expression cloning of an iron transporter from rat duodenum (3.Gunshin H. Mackenzie B. Berger U.V. Gunshin Y. Romero M.F. Boron W.F. Nussberger S. Gollan J.L. Hediger M.A. Nature. 1997; 388: 482-487Crossref PubMed Scopus (2641) Google Scholar) and the positional cloning of the human homologue, Nramp2 (4.Fleming M.D. Trenor C.C. Su M.A. Foernzler D. Beier D.R. Dietrich W.F. Andrews N.C. Nat. Genet. 1997; 16: 383-386Crossref PubMed Scopus (1016) Google Scholar). In the Caco-2 cell model of human small intestinal enterocytes Nramp2 mRNA is down-regulated by increasing cellular iron status (5.Han O. Fleet J.C. Wood R.J. J. Nutr. 1999; 129: 98-104Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar), suggesting a role in iron homeostasis. In addition, in both microcytic anemic (mk) mice (4.Fleming M.D. Trenor C.C.

A. 1998; 95: 1148-1153Crossref PubMed Scopus (803) Google Scholar), there is a defect in intestinal iron transport that has been mapped to the gene encoding the protein Nramp2. Taken together these data suggest to us that Nramp2 should be expressed on human enterocyte plasma membranes and function as an iron transporter. Our present study has tested this hypothesis, and accordingly, we present evidence that human enterocytes absorb iron across their apical membrane in a pH-dependent fashion. Using cells loaded with the fluorescent dye BCECF,1 we show that there is a concurrent intracellular acidification induced by iron in the bathing medium. With an antibody generated against Nramp2, we demonstrate the expression of a 66-kDa apical membrane-resident protein in Caco-2 TC7 cells. Finally, we present evidence that in human enterocytes the pH-dependent iron uptake associated with Nramp2 expression has a different substrate specificity profile than the rat homologue, showing selectivity for iron over other divalent metals. Caco-2 TC7 cells were obtained from Drs. Monique Rousset and Edith Brot-Laroche (INSERM U178, Villejuif). Stock cultures of cells were maintained in 25-cm2 plastic flasks and cultured in a 90% air, 10% CO2 atmosphere in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's minimal essential medium supplemented with 20% heat-inactivated fetal bovine serum. All experiments were carried out on cells between passage numbers 30 and 35. For experiments, cells were seeded at a density of 1 × 104 cells/cm2 onto either glass coverslips for pH measurements or Transwell inserts (Costar) for all other experiments and used 20 days later. Caco-2 TC7 cells were fully differentiated at this time and demonstrated a small intestinal phenotype (data not shown), which has been described previously (7.Chantret I. Rodolosse A. Barbat A. Dussaulx E. Brot-Laroche E. Zweibaum A. Rousset M. J. Cell Sci. 1994; 107: 213-225Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). To investigate the regulation of Nramp2 by iron status, in some experiments cells were grown for the last 5 days in medium supplemented with 50 μm Fe3+ (complexed with a 2-fold excess of nitrilotriacetic acid). To determine the nature of iron transport across the Caco-2 TC7 cell monolayer, cells were grown on Transwell inserts. To achieve transepithelial pH gradients, either Hepes-buffered salt solution (HBSS), pH 7.5, containing 140 mm NaCl, 5 mm KCl, 1 mm Na2HPO4, 1 mm CaCl2, 0.5 mm MgCl2, 5 mm glucose, 10 mm Hepes, 0.2% bovine serum albumin, PBSS (pH 6.5, substituting Pipes for Hepes) or MBSS (pH 5.5, substituting MES for Hepes) were added to the apical chamber. HBSS was placed in the basolateral chamber. Uptake was initiated by the addition of 100 μm Fe2+, ascorbate (1:10 molar ratio) and 37 kBq/ml 55FeCl3 to the apical chamber and terminated after 60 min. Cells, solubilized in 200 mm NaOH, were subjected to scintillation counting to determine cell uptake. An aliquot of the basolateral medium was counted to determine transepithelial iron movement. Parallel experiments in which [14C]mannitol was substituted for55Fe2+ were performed to distinguish the passive transport component. Experiments measuring zinc uptake used a similar protocol and employed 65ZnCl2 as the radioligand tracer. For inhibition studies, 1 μm55Fe2+ and 100 μm appropriate divalent cation were added to the apical chamber, pH 5.5, and after 1 h, incubation the cells processed as above. After removal of culture medium, cell monolayers were washed twice in phosphate buffer, and harvested using a cell scraper. Enriched apical membranes were prepared by the MgCl2 precipitation technique (8.Sharp P.A. Debnam E.S. Exp. Physiol. 1994; 79: 203-214Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar) and used for Western blotting. Cell membranes and samples of the whole cell homogenates were solubilized in Laemmli buffer (9.Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 277: 680-685Crossref Scopus (206631) Google Scholar) and subjected to 10% SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. The proteins were transferred onto nitrocellulose (Hybond ECL, Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) and blocked overnight in phosphate buffer containing 0.05% Tween 20 and 1% fat-free milk. The nitrocellulose was incubated for 2 h at room temperature with a polyclonal antibody (1:250 dilution) raised in rabbit against a synthetic peptide corresponding to amino acids 310–330 of the human Nramp2 sequence or with a commercially available (Chemicon, Harrow, UK) polyclonal antibody to the sodium glucose cotransporter, SGLT1 (1:2000 dilution). After removal of the primary antibody, a secondary antibody against rabbit IgG (horseradish peroxide-labeled) was used, and cross-reactivity was visualized using enhanced chemiluminescence and Hyperfilm ECL (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). Western blots were analyzed by scanning densitometry to determine the enrichment of the transporters in the apical membrane of the intestinal epithelial cells. Caco-2 TC7 cells grown on semipermeable supports were fixed for 30 min with 4% paraformaldehyde (w/v) in phosphate-buffered saline and permeabilized with 0.1% Triton X-100 for a further 30 min. After blocking with normal goat serum, monolayers were incubated overnight at 4 °C with Nramp2 (1:20) or SGLT1 (1:200) antibodies. A fluorescein isothiocyanate-labeled anti-rabbit secondary antibody was used to visualize cross-reactivity. Optical sections (2 μm) were obtained using a Bio-Rad DVC-250 confocal microscope through the z plane of the Caco-2 TC7 cell monolayer. To assess the effect of extracellular iron on intracellular pH, cells grown for 20 days on glass coverslips were loaded in HBSS containing the pH-sensitive dye BCECF-AM (5 μm) for 40 min at 37 °C. Coverslips were transferred to fresh HBSS for 20 min to allow de-esterification of the dye. The glass coverslip formed the base of an experimental chamber attached to the stage of an inverted epifluorescence microscope (Zeiss IM35, ×40 neofluor Nikon objective) that was coupled to a fluorescence imaging system (Photon Technology International) with an intensified CCD video camera (Photonic Sciences, Sussex, UK). The cells were continually perifused with oxygenated HBSS or PBSS (37 °C) during the course of the experiment, and changes in the experimental solutions (prewarmed to 37 °C) were administered via a two-way tap. The fluorescence ratio (495/450-nm excitation, 530 nm-emission) was measured in a group of approximately 50 cells. In our system a decrease in the fluorescence ratio corresponds to an intracellular acidification (10.Williams M.R. Duncan G. Croghan P.C. Riach R.A. Webb S.F. J. Memb. Biol. 1992; 129: 179-187Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar). Total RNA (20 μg), isolated using Trizol reagent (Life Technologies, Inc.) was fractionated by electrophoresis on 1% agarose gels under denaturing conditions. RNA was transferred to Hybond-N membrane (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) and hybridized for 16 h at 42 °C in 50% formamide with a full-length cDNA clone labeled with [32P]dCTP using a random priming kit (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). Membranes were washed in 5 × SSC (1× SSC = 0.15 m NaCl and 0.015m sodium citrate), 0.1% SDS at 50 °C for 2 × 30 min and 0.1 × SSC, 0.1% SDS at 65 °C for 3 × 20 min before exposure to x-ray film. Data are presented as the mean ± S.E. Statistical analysis was carried out using SPSS statistics package employing either Student's unpaired t test when comparing 2 data sets or a one-way analysis of variance followed by Scheffe's post-hoc analysis when comparing multiple data sets. Differences were considered significant at p < 0.05. Radiochemicals and materials for Western blotting were supplied by Amersham Pharmacia Biotech. Cell culture medium and plastic ware were purchased from Life Technologies unless stated. Heat-inactivated fetal bovine serum was from Sigma. All other chemicals were of the highest grade available and bought from Sigma, Merck, or Fluka. The time course of iron uptake by Caco-2 TC7 cells could be fitted by a 1-exponential relationship (Fig.1 A). The uptake of ferrous ascorbate (100 μm Fe2+) across the apical membrane of cell monolayer was determined by the pHa and was significantly higher at both pHa 6.5 and pHa 5.5 compared with pHa 7.5 (Fig. 1 B). Transepithelial flux of iron from apical to basal was also increased significantly at low pHa (Fig. 1 C). Further analysis of these data revealed that the vast majority of iron utilizes the transcellular rather than paracellular route and that approximately 96% of this iron is retained within the cell within the time course of the experiment. Interestingly, transfer to the basolateral chamber was not pH-dependent when expressed as a function of apical uptake (Fig. 1 D). When the pH gradient across the epithelium was reversed, i.e. pHa 7.5/pHb 5.5, there was no pH-dependent movement of iron from the basolateral chamber into the cells (data not shown), confirming that pH-dependent transport was confined to the apical membrane. Western blotting revealed a major cross-reacting band in the apical membrane of Caco-2 TC7 cells at 66 kDa, which is in agreement with the predicted molecular mass of this transporter (Fig.2 A). Nramp2 was enriched (66%) in the apical membrane fraction of Caco-2 TC7 cells compared with whole cell protein levels (Fig. 2 A). Parallel blots for the apical membrane-resident transporter SGLT1 showed similar levels of enrichment (57%) in the plasma membrane fraction compared with whole cell amounts (Fig. 2 B). Confocal microscopy using Caco-2 TC7 cells grown on semipermeable supports showed significant apical staining for both Nramp2 (Fig.2 C) and SGLT1 (Fig. 2 E). Sequential sections (2 μm) through the z plane of the monolayer revealed that staining was confined to the apical section and was not present at the basolateral surface of the cells (Figs. 2, D andF). The specificity of the antibody for Nramp2 was confirmed by preadsorbing the antiserum with the original immunizing peptide before blotting (Fig. 3 A). Lanes 1 and 3 show the 69-kDa molecular mass marker as an internal control for development of the blots. The cross-reacting band at 66 kDa is clearly lost following peptide adsorption of the antiserum (lane 4). To demonstrate directly the link between Nramp2 and iron transport across the apical membrane of Caco-2 TC7 cells, the specific Nramp2 antibody (1:20 dilution) was added to the apical chamber of the Transwell inserts. Nonimmune rabbit serum (1:20 dilution) served as a control. In the antibody-treated wells iron uptake was reduced by 45% compared with nonimmune serum-treated cells (Fig. 3 B). There was a concomitant decrease in iron flux across the Caco-2 epithelium following antibody treatment (Fig. 3 C) that was proportional to the decrease in apical uptake. Paracellular permeability was not affected by antibody treatment (data not shown). Preliminary experiments on pHi in Caco-2 TC7 cells using nigericin (5 μm) showed that changes in the fluorescence ratio were linear with intracellular pH between pH 7.5 to 6.5 (data not shown), which is in agreement with data from other epithelial cell types (10.Williams M.R. Duncan G. Croghan P.C. Riach R.A. Webb S.F. J. Memb. Biol. 1992; 129: 179-187Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar). Perifusing the cells with PBSS, pH 6.5, resulted in an intracellular acidification that started to plateau after 10 min (Fig. 4). Upon reaching the plateau, 100 μm Fe2+ (given as a complex with ascorbic acid) was added to the apical medium, and a further rapid intracellular acidification was observed that was reversible. At pHo 7.5, Fe2+ ascorbate again induced intracellular acidification but with a much reduced rate and amplitude compared with pHo 6.5. This response was also fully reversible upon removal of the iron challenge. These intracellular events can be attributed directly to the addition of iron, since the addition of ascorbate alone (500 μm) at pHo 6.5 (Fig. 4) or at pHo7.5 (data not shown) had no further effect on the fluorescence ratio and, thus, intracellular pH. Caco-2 TC7 cells grown in iron-supplemented medium for the final 5 days before experimentation exhibited a decrease in Nramp2 mRNA levels (Fig.5 A) and an associated 2-fold decrease in Nramp2 protein expression in apical membrane fractions (Fig. 5 B). These changes in mRNA and protein expression were manifested as a decrease (30%) in functional iron transport across the apical membrane of Caco-2 TC7 cells (Fig. 5 C). Interestingly, the uptake of zinc, which is thought to be a substrate for Nramp2, was not affected by the iron-dependent changes in Nramp2 expression and function (Fig. 5 D), suggesting differences in transport pathways for these divalent metals. The role of Nramp2 as a divalent metal transporter was assessed by measuring the rate of uptake of 55Fe2+ by Caco-2 TC7 cells in competition with a range of divalent metals (Fig.6 A). At pHa5.5/pHb 7.5, absorption of 1 μm iron (285 pmol/cm2/h) was reduced by approximately 80% following the addition of a 100-fold excess of unlabeled Fe2+. Of the other metals used in this study only cadmium (75% inhibition) and cobalt (50% inhibition) showed significant competition with iron for transport via this pathway, although all metals inhibited to some extent. Calcium, which provided our control 100% uptake measurement, did not compete with iron for this transport pathway. To elucidate further the nature of the divalent cation uptake pathway we measured 65Zn absorption by Caco-2 TC7 cells. In contrast to the absorption of iron, zinc uptake (100 μm) was not dependent on extracellular pH (Fig. 6 B). Uptake of metal ions via the Nramp2 pathway is thought to be dependent on membrane potential (3.Gunshin H. Mackenzie B. Berger U.V. Gunshin Y. Romero M.F. Boron W.F. Nussberger S. Gollan J.L. Hediger M.A. Nature. 1997; 388: 482-487Crossref PubMed Scopus (2641) Google Scholar). We used high K+ solutions to depolarize Caco-2 TC7 cells and found that iron uptake was decreased by 42%, in agreement with voltage requirement (Fig. 6 C). In contrast, the absorption of zinc was unaffected by the dissipation of the membrane potential (Fig. 6 C). Little is known about the cellular mechanisms involved in the control of intestinal non-heme iron absorption, but the results of several previous studies have shown that iron uptake across the apical membrane of enterocytes is of major importance in determining the rate of absorption across the intestinal epithelium (11.Cox T.M. Peters T.J. Q. J. Med. 1980; 49: 249-257PubMed Google Scholar, 12.Cox T.M. O'Donnell M.W. Biochem. J. 1981; 194: 753-759Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar, 13.O'Riordan D.K. Sharp P. Sykes R.M. Srai S.K.S. Epstein O. Debnam E.S. Eur. J. Clin. Invest. 1995; 25: 722-727Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar, 14.O'Riordan D.K. Debnam E.S. Sharp P.A. Simpson R.J. Taylor E.M. Srai S.K.S. J. Physiol. (Lond.). 1997; 500: 379-384Crossref Scopus (26) Google Scholar). The requirement for the apical iron transporter Nramp2 in maintaining iron homeostasis is very evident, since a mutation in this protein is responsible for microcytic anemia in both mk/mk mice (4.Fleming M.D. Trenor C.C. Su M.A. Foernzler D. Beier D.R. Dietrich W.F. Andrews N.C. Nat. Genet. 1997; 16: 383-386Crossref PubMed Scopus (1016) Google Scholar) and Belgrade rats (6.Fleming M.D. Romano M.A. Su M.A. Garrick L.M. Garrick M.D. Andrews N.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 1148-1153Crossref PubMed Scopus (803) Google Scholar). The regulation and mechanisms of iron uptake across this membrane are therefore of great interest. Caco-2 cells have been used extensively as a human model to study many facets of iron homeostasis, including the expression of ferritin (15.Halleux C. Schnieder Y.J. In Vitro Cell Dev. Biol. 1991; 27: 293-302Crossref Scopus (84) Google Scholar) transferrin receptor (16.Nunez M.T. Tapia V. Arredondo M. J. Nutr. 1996; 126: 2151-2158Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar), and IRP-1 and IRP-2 (17.Arredondo M. Orellana A. Garate M.A. Nunez M.T. Am. J. Physiol. 1997; 273: G275-G280PubMed Google Scholar). In addition, Caco-2 cells are similar to “normal” enterocytes with regard to the expression of most of their differentiation markers (18.Carriere V. Barbat A. Rousset M. Brot-Laroche E. Dussaulx E. Cambier D. Dewaziers I. Beaune P. Zweibaum A. Am. J. Physiol. 1996; 270: G976-G986PubMed Google Scholar) and yield very similar data to those achieved with human absorption studies (19.Glahn R.P. Wien E.M. Van Campen D.R. Miller D.D. J. Nutr. 1996; 126: 332-339Crossref PubMed Scopus (163) Google Scholar), making them a very pertinent human model to study the regulation of iron absorption. Preliminary studies from our laboratory have demonstrated that iron absorption by Caco-2 TC7 cells is time- and concentration-dependent, exhibits saturation kinetics, and is inversely proportional to pHo (20.Sharp P.A. Dedes M. Williams M.R. Z. Gastroenterol. (Verh.). 1998; 36 (abstr.): 342Google Scholar, 21.Flatman R. Dedes M. Williams M. Sharp P. J. Physiol. (Lond.). 1998; 511 (abstr.): 26Google Scholar). In the present study, we have localized pH-dependent iron transport to the apical membrane in Caco-2 TC7 cells (Fig. 1 B). Proton-dependent uptake was not observed in the basal to apical direction. The appearance of iron in the basolateral compartment was directly proportional to transport across the apical membrane (Fig.1 D), further confirming the importance of the apical transport pathway in determining transepithelial movement of iron. Western blotting of apical membranes prepared from Caco-2 TC7 cells demonstrated that Nramp2 was present as a 66-kDa protein (Figs.2 A and 3 A), which is very close to the predicted molecular mass of this transporter (64 kDa). Immunofluorescence labeling of Caco-2 TC7 cells with the same Nramp2 antibody, viewed by confocal microscopy, confirmed that the transporter was localized to apical membrane (Fig. 2 C). There was no evidence of basolateral staining (Fig. 2 D). This is in good agreement with a recent report (22.Canonne-Hergaux F. Greunheid S. Ponka P. Gros P. Blood. 1999; 93: 4406-4417Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) that demonstrated the presence of Nramp2 at the apical surface and associated with microsomal fractions in rat enterocytes. Previous studies using transfected cells showed that this microsomal locus is the recycling endosome, suggesting a role for Nramp2 in iron accumulation from the transferrin receptor pathway (23.Su M.A. Trenor III, C.C. Fleming J.C. Fleming M.D. Andrews N.C. Blood. 1998; 92: 2157-2163Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Our study has established a direct link between Nramp2 expression and iron uptake in Caco-2 TC7 cells. Iron uptake was blocked by 45% by co-incubation with our Nramp2-specific antibody (Fig. 3 B). This provides the first physiological evidence that Nramp2 plays a major role in iron transport across the apical membrane of human small intestinal enterocytes. In accordance with proton-dependent iron uptake, we found that the addition of ferrous ascorbate to the apical medium resulted in intracellular acidification at both pHo 7.5 and 6.5 (Fig. 4). The rate of acidification (directly proportional to the BCECF fluorescence ratio, data not shown) was approximately 3-fold greater at pHo 6.5. Importantly, the relative increase in the rate of intracellular acidification is an underestimate of the increase in apical proton influx, since the intrinsic buffering capacity is greater at lower intracellular pH (data not shown). Iron-induced intracellular acidification at pHo 7.5, where the pH gradient would be expected to be outwardly directed, could be explained by the presence of an acidic microclimate, which surrounds enterocytes in the unstirred layers both in vivo (24.McEwan G.T.A. Daniel H. Fett C. Burgess M.N. Lucas M.L. Proc. R. Soc. Lond. Ser. B Biol. Sci. 1988; 234: 219-237Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar) and in vitro (25.Lucas M.L. Cooper B.T. Lei F.H. Johnson I.T. Holmes G.K.T. Blair J.A. Cooke W.T. Gut. 1978; 19: 735-742Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar) Additionally, Caco-2 cells have a membrane potential of −43mV, 2P. Sharp, E. Debnam, and S. Srai, unpublished information. which would result in an inwardly directed proton motive force in our experimental system. These data are consistent with the hypothesis that iron absorption across the apical membrane of enterocytes is proton-coupled and is dependent on the functional expression of Nramp 2. Nramp2 contains an iron response element in the 3′-untranslated region (3.Gunshin H. Mackenzie B. Berger U.V. Gunshin Y. Romero M.F. Boron W.F. Nussberger S. Gollan J.L. Hediger M.A. Nature. 1997; 388: 482-487Crossref PubMed Scopus (2641) Google Scholar), which should lead to decreased mRNA stability under iron-loaded conditions. Our data are consistent with this hypothesis, demonstrating that Nramp2 is down-regulated at mRNA (Fig.5 A) and protein level (Fig. 5 B) by increasing cellular iron status. These iron-dependent effects on protein and mRNA expression translate into modulation of transport function in Caco-2 TC7 cells (Fig. 5 C). Interestingly, zinc uptake was unaffected by these iron-dependent changes in Nramp2 expression and function (Fig. 5 D). Previous work has suggested that zinc is also a major substrate for the Nramp2 transport pathway (3.Gunshin H. Mackenzie B. Berger U.V. Gunshin Y. Romero M.F. Boron W.F. Nussberger S. Gollan J.L. Hediger M.A. Nature. 1997; 388: 482-487Crossref PubMed Scopus (2641) Google Scholar), and as such its uptake should also be modified by changes in transporter expression. This is not the case, and therefore, this led us to investigate the role that Nramp2 plays in the absorption of other divalent cations. Previous studies on the substrate specificity of the Nramp2 transporter were based on an indirect methodology, measuring inward currents evoked in the presence of metal ions (3.Gunshin H. Mackenzie B. Berger U.V. Gunshin Y. Romero M.F. Boron W.F. Nussberger S. Gollan J.L. Hediger M.A. Nature. 1997; 388: 482-487Crossref PubMed Scopus (2641) Google Scholar). In light of our finding that zinc uptake by Caco-2 TC7 cells was not affected by changing the levels of expression of the transporter, we employed radioligand uptake techniques to determine precisely the divalent metal transport characteristics of Nramp2 in these cells. By assessing55Fe2+ uptake in competition with several divalent metals, we have demonstrated that iron is the preferred substrate for the Nramp2 pathway, and only cadmium and cobalt exhibited inhibition of iron uptake by 50% or greater (Fig. 6 A). To further address the issue of substrate specificity, we measured65Zn uptake by Caco-2 TC7 cells. If zinc, which showed the lowest inhibition of iron transport in our competition assay (Fig.6 A), crosses the apical membrane via Nramp2, we would have expected to see pH-dependent absorption. However, unlike iron, the uptake of zinc is not pH-dependent (Fig.6 B). Moreover, previous studies using small intestinal brush border membrane vesicles showed that imposition of an inwardly directed pH gradient had an inhibitory effect on zinc transport (26.Tacnet F. Lauthier F. Ripoche P. J. Physiol. (Lond.). 1993; 465: 57-72Crossref Scopus (39) Google Scholar). Uptake of iron and other divalent metals, including zinc, via Nramp2 inXenopus oocytes is dependent on membrane potential (3.Gunshin H. Mackenzie B. Berger U.V. Gunshin Y. Romero M.F. Boron W.F. Nussberger S. Gollan J.L. Hediger M.A. Nature. 1997; 388: 482-487Crossref PubMed Scopus (2641) Google Scholar). We have shown in this study and previously (13.O'Riordan D.K. Sharp P. Sykes R.M. Srai S.K.S. Epstein O. Debnam E.S. Eur. J. Clin. Invest. 1995; 25: 722-727Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar) that depolarization of enterocytes with high K+ solutions (giving a resting membrane potential of −5 mV, data not shown) results in a significant decrease in iron transport across the apical membrane of intestinal epithelial cells (Fig. 6 C). In our experiments, the uptake of zinc is unaffected by dissipation of the membrane potential (Fig.6 C). Taken together, our findings that 1) zinc uptake is not affected by decreased expression of Nramp2 (Fig. 5 D), 2) zinc does not compete with iron for uptake via this transport pathway (Fig. 6 A), 3) the absorption of zinc is not pH-dependent (Fig. 6 B), and 4) zinc transport is not dependent on membrane potential (Fig. 6 C) strongly suggests that iron and zinc are absorbed by different and distinct transport mechanisms in this acknowledged model of human intestinal enterocytes. In agreement with this hypothesis, a number of other zinc uptake pathways are present in the apical membrane of Caco-2 cells that are not affected by metabolic inhibitors (27.Raffaniello R.D. Lee S.Y. Teichberg S. Wapnir R.A. J. Cell. Physiol. 1992; 152: 356-361Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar) or are linear and nonsaturable (28.Fleet J.C. Turnbull A.J. Bourcier M. Wood R.J. Am. J. Physiol. 1993; 264: G1037-G1045Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and therefore likely to be distinct from Nramp2. Clearly, although iron is the preferred substrate for the Nramp2 pathway, further work is required to fully elucidate the relative contribution of Nramp2 to the absorption of other divalent metals by intestinal enterocytes and to determine the nature of other transport pathways that may be involved. In conclusion, we have demonstrated that iron uptake occurs across the apical membrane of Caco-2 TC7 cells in a pH-dependent fashion, and the presence of the Nramp2 transporter in the apical membrane is associated with iron transport function. Furthermore, when iron is added to the bathing medium there is a concomitant intracellular acidification. Nramp2 expression and function are modulated as a function of the prevailing iron levels in the culture medium, and transport via this pathway shows a preference for iron over several other divalent metals. Taken together, these data suggest that, first and foremost, Nramp2 act as an iron transporter in the apical membrane of human intestinal Caco-2 TC7 cells. We are grateful to Dr. Edith Brot-Laroche for advice in setting up the Caco-2 TC7 cell culture system, Susanne Lindqvist for help with cell culture, Dr. Julia Marcantonio for assistance with confocal microscopy, and Alba Warn for excellent technical assistance."

Although proliferation and differentiation of normal prostate epithelia and the initial growth of prostate cancer cells are androgen-dependent, prostate cancers ultimately become androgen-independent and refractory to hormone therapy. The prostate-specific antigen (PSA) gene has been widely used as a diagnostic indicator for androgen-dependent and -independent prostate cancer. Androgen-induced and prostate epithelium-specific PSA expression is regulated by a proximal promoter and an upstream enhancer via several androgen receptor binding sites. However, little progress has been made in identifying androgen-independent regulatory elements involved in PSA gene regulation. We report the isolation of a novel, prostate epithelium-specific Ets transcription factor, PDEF (prostate-derived Etsfactor), that among the Ets family uniquely prefers binding to a GGAT rather than a GGAA core. PDEF acts as an androgen-independent transcriptional activator of the PSA promoter. PDEF also directly interacts with the DNA binding domain of androgen receptor and enhances androgen-mediated activation of the PSA promoter. Our results, as well as the critical roles of other Ets factors in cellular differentiation and tumorigenesis, strongly suggest that PDEF is an important regulator of prostate gland and/or prostate cancer development.

A. 1994; 91: 11874-11878Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar). Proliferation within the normal and hyperplastic prostate epithelium is restricted to the basal cells and is regulated by autocrine or paracrine growth factors. Differentiation from basal cells to secretory luminal epithelial cells is androgen-dependent, and androgen remains crucial for the initial growth of prostate cancer cells (3.Rhim J.S. Webber M.M. Bello D. Lee M.S. Arnstein P. Chen L.S. Jay G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 11874-11878Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar, 4.Robinson E.J. Neal D.E. Collins A.T. Prostate. 1998; 37: 149-160Crossref PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar). Nevertheless, prostate cancers ultimately become androgen-independent and refractory to hormone therapy. PSA1 has been used widely as a diagnostic indicator for prostate cancer (5.Ablin R.J. J. Cancer Res. Clin. Oncol. 1997; 123: 583-594Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). PSA is expressed by normal and cancerous luminal epithelial cells of the prostate, and its expression is under the control of androgens acting through the AR (5.Ablin R.J. J. Cancer Res. Clin. Oncol. 1997; 123: 583-594Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). However, even in hormone-refractory prostate cancer, PSA is expressed, suggesting an androgen-independent component in PSA regulation as well (6.Sadar M.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 7777-7783Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (235) Google Scholar). PSA gene expression is regulated by the proximal promoter and a strong upstream enhancer region (7.Cleutjens K.B. van der Korput H.A. Ehren-van Eekelen C.C. Sikes R.A. Fasciana C. Chung L.W.

Both regulatory regions contain binding sites for AR and are essential for androgen-induced transcriptional activation of the PSA gene. However, little progress has been made in identifying androgen-independent regulatory elements involved in PSA gene regulation. We report here the characterization of a novel prostate epithelial-specific Ets transcription factor, PDEF, that is involved in PSA gene regulation and acts as a co-regulator of AR. Ets factors play a crucial role in the regulation of genes involved in hematopoiesis, angiogenesis, organogenesis, and specification of neuronal connectivity (10.Wasylyk B. Hagman J.

Transfections were performed independently in triplicate and repeated three times with two different plasmid preparations with similar results.

Tissues fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde in phosphate-buffered saline, pH 7.4, for 2–4 h at 4 °C were transferred to 30% sucrose in phosphate-buffered saline overnight at 4 °C, frozen in OCT compound (Miles Diagnostics, Elkhart, IN), and stored at −70 °C. In situ hybridization was performed on 6-μm frozen sections with 35S-labeled riboprobes as described (15.Oettgen P. Alani R.M. Barcinski M.A. Brown L. Akbarali Y. Boltax J. Kunsch C. Munger K.

A series of GST-AR fusion proteins were generated by PCR with specific primers to contain in frame restriction enzyme sites (30.Sun Z. Pan J. Balk S.P. Nucleic Acids Res. 1997; 25: 3318-3325Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar) and sequenced to confirm that there were no mutations introduced by the PCR. GST fusion proteins were prepared as described before (31.Smith D.B. Johnson K.S. Gene (Amst.). 1988; 67: 31-40Crossref PubMed Scopus (5047) Google Scholar). 5 μl of [35S]methionine labeled in vitro translated full-length PDEF protein was incubated with equal amounts of GST-AR fusion proteins or GST on agarose beads in 200 μl of NETN (0.5% Nonidet P-40, 1 mm EDTA, 20 mmTris-HCl, pH 8.0, 100 mm NaCl) for 3 h at 4 °C with gentle shaking. PDEF protein that bound to the GST-AR fusion proteins was eluted after three washings with NETN buffer and analyzed on a 12% SDS-polyacrylamide gel. We have isolated full-length cDNA clones from human prostate encoding a novel member of the Ets transcription factor/oncogene family, PDEF (Fig.1 A). Sequence analysis revealed an open reading frame encoding a 335-amino acid protein with a predicted molecular mass of 37.5 kDa. The deduced amino acid sequence of PDEF predicts a protein rich in glutamic acid (8%), alanine (8%), serine (11%), leucine (10%), and proline (8%). Two putative PEST domains, common to rapidly degraded proteins, are located between amino acids 19 and 53 and between 161 and 186. Potential phosphorylation sites present in PDEF include a protein kinase C site, two AKT phosphorylation sites, two tyrosine kinase phosphorylation sites, and eight c-Jun NH2-terminal kinase/p38/extracellular signal-regulated kinase kinase phosphorylation sites. Five of these MAP kinase phosphorylation sites are clustered at the amino terminus of PDEF, and one of these sites conforms to the optimal MAP kinase phosphorylation site PX(S/T)P (Fig. 1 A). One of the tyrosine kinase phosphorylation sites contains the consensus sequence for interaction with phosphoinositol 3-kinase, YXXM (32.Songyang Z. Blechner S. Hoagland N. Hoekstra M.F. Piwnica W.H.

Alignment of the carboxyl-terminal ETS domain of PDEF with that of other Ets family members reveals highest homology to one particular subclass of Ets factors that includesDrosophila D-ets-4 (75%) and sea urchin SpETS4 (76%) (Fig.1 B). SpEts4 plays a role in establishing the animal-vegetal axis of the sea urchin embryo at late cleavage/early blastula stages (33.Wei Z. Angerer R.C. Angerer L.M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 1271-1278Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). D-Ets-4 is expressed highest in the pole cells, suggesting an involvement in germ line differentiation (34.Chen T. Bunting M. Karim F.D. Thummel C.S. Dev. Biol. 1992; 151: 176-191Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). Upstream of the Ets domain, PDEF contains a region with significant homology to the Pointed domain present in several other members of the Ets family including ESE-1, ESE-2, ESE-3, Tel, Tel-2, yan, pointed, Ets-1, Ets-2, fli-1, erg-2, Elg, and GABP-α and weakly homologous to the SAM protein-protein interaction domain of polycomb proteins and Eph receptors (35.Stapleton D. Balan I. Pawson T. Sicheri F. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1999; 6: 44-49Crossref PubMed Scopus (215) Google Scholar) (Fig. 1 C). In contrast to all other Ets factors where the Pointed domain is directly at the amino terminus and the Ets domain at the opposite carboxyl terminus, PDEF has the Pointed domain immediately upstream of the Ets domain. Expression of PDEF was analyzed by Northern blot hybridization of poly(A)+ mRNAs derived from human adult and fetal tissues, indicating the presence of one predominant PDEF transcript of ∼2.0 kb (Fig.2 A). PDEF is almost exclusively expressed in the prostate gland. Low levels of PDEF transcripts were also found in ovary (Fig. 2 A) and in mammary and salivary gland (data not shown), all tissues regulated by androgens or steroids. No PDEF transcripts were detected in brain, heart, gastrointestinal tract, liver, spleen, thymus, kidney, lung, and skeletal muscle or in fetal tissues. These results suggest that PDEF is expressed in a very restricted set of primarily hormone-regulated epithelial tissues with particularly high expression in prostate, an expression pattern strikingly different from other Ets factors such as ESE-1 (Fig. 2 A). More detailed analysis of PDEF expression in different cell types by RT-PCR revealed that only the prostate epithelial cancer cell line, LNCaP, expressed PDEF mRNA, whereas other epithelial cells and non-epithelial cells were completely devoid of PDEF mRNA (Fig.2 B). To further test the hypothesis that PDEF expression is restricted to epithelial cells within the prostate gland, we performedin situ hybridization on frozen sections of human prostate. Diffuse strong expression was only noted in luminal epithelium of the prostate, but not in other cell types (Fig. 2 C). These results most vividly demonstrate that PDEF is exclusively expressed in epithelial cells and particularly strong in the prostate. In the prostate, PDEF expression is restricted to luminal epithelial cells, the exact cells that express PSA. The PSA gene is regulated by an androgen-responsive promoter and an androgen-responsive upstream enhancer (Fig.3 A). At least eight high and low affinity androgen receptor binding sites have been identified in the promoter and enhancer region and implicated in androgen-mediated regulation of the PSA gene. Inspection of the PSA promoter and enhancer sequence revealed the existence of at least 11 putative Ets binding sites. Some of these sites are in close proximity to androgen receptor binding sites (Fig. 3 A). To determine whether the PSA promoter contains binding sites for PDEF, we tested the ability ofin vitro translated PDEF to bind specifically to oligonucleotides containing a variety of Ets related binding sites derived from the PSA promoter. EMSA analysis revealed that the PSA E site and G site oligonucleotides formed two major complexes with proteins present in the PDEF extract (Fig. 3 B), which were not formed by the control extract (Fig. 3 B). A third strong complex was nonspecific and was present in both PDEF and control reticulocyte lysates. Two additional PSA sites, site H and to a lesser extent site C (Fig. 3 C), formed weak complexes with PDEF, whereas other potential Ets sites in the PSA promoter did not significantly interact with PDEF. Strikingly, the high affinity binding sites for PDEF diverge from the binding sites found for other Ets factors showing an apparent preference for GGAT versus GGAA in the core of the binding site (Fig. 3 C). EMSA analysis of additional canonical Ets sites from other promoters did not reveal any significant PDEF binding, suggesting strong DNA binding selectivity for PDEF. 2P. Oettgen, E. Finger, Z. Sun, Y. Akbarali, U. Thamrongsak, J. Boltax, F. Grall, A. Dube, A. Weiss, L. Brown, G. Quinn, K. Kas, G. Endress, C. Kunsch, and T. A. Libermann, manuscript in preparation. To directly assess the relative DNA binding specificity and affinity of PDEF and other members of the Ets family, we compared the ability of PDEF and several other Ets factors to bind to the GGAT containing PSA promoter E site and to the same site containing a single nucleotide change to GGAA in the core of the binding site. PDEF bound with high affinity only to the GGAT-containing oligonucleotide, but not to the GGAA-containing oligonucleotide (Fig. 4). Some low affinity binding of ESE-3 to the GGAT oligonucleotide was also observed. In striking contrast to PDEF ESE-1, ESE-2, ESE-3, NERF-2, ELF-1, and PU.1 bound with high affinity exclusively to the GGAA-containing oligonucleotide, whereas Tel was unable to interact with either of the oligonucleotides (Fig. 4). These results provide strong evidence that the DNA binding specificity of PDEF is distinct from other members of the Ets family and uniquely shifted toward a GGAT recognition sequence. To assess whether the PSA gene is indeed a target for PDEF and to determine whether PDEF acts as a repressor or enhancer of transcription, full-length PDEF inserted into the eukaryotic expression vector pCI was co-transfected into PDEF- and AR-negative CV-1 cells together with a reporter gene construct containing the luciferase gene under the control of the 7-kb PSA promoter. Co-transfection with pCI/PDEF resulted in a ∼4-fold transcriptional stimulation of the PSA promoter construct compared with the parental pCI vector (Fig.5). The specificity of this effect was evaluated in co-transfections with other epithelial-restricted members of the Ets family that are expressed in the prostate. Neither ESE-1 nor ESE-2 enhanced PSA promoter activity. On the contrary, ESE-1, and to a lesser extent ESE-2, repressed basal PSA promoter activity (Fig.5). To confirm that the PSA promoter is a target for PDEF in prostate epithelium, the same transfection experiment was repeated in LNCaP cells, which are widely used as a model for prostate cancer, since these cells are androgen-sensitive, secrete PSA, and form androgen-sensitive tumors in nude mice (36.Chung L.W.

https://openalex.org/W2155845672,"Five members of a novel Ca2+-binding protein subfamily (CaBP), with 46–58% sequence similarity to calmodulin (CaM), were identified in the vertebrate retina. Important differences between these Ca2+-binding proteins and CaM include alterations within their second EF-hand loop that render these motifs inactive in Ca2+ coordination and the fact that their central α-helixes are extended by one α-helical turn. CaBP1 and CaBP2 contain a consensus sequence for N-terminal myristoylation, similar to members of the recoverin subfamily and are fatty acid acylated in vitro. The patterns of expression differ for each of the various members. Expression of CaBP5, for example, is restricted to retinal rod and cone bipolar cells. In contrast, CaBP1 has a more widespread pattern of expression. In the brain, CaBP1 is found in the cerebral cortex and hippocampus, and in the retina this protein is found in cone bipolar and amacrine cells. CaBP1 and CaBP2 are expressed as multiple, alternatively spliced variants, and in heterologous expression systems these forms show different patterns of subcellular localization. In reconstitution assays, CaBPs are able to substitute functionally for CaM. These data suggest that these novel CaBPs are an important component of Ca2+-mediated cellular signal transduction in the central nervous system where they may augment or substitute for CaM.

Ca2+ ions function as a diffusible signal that exerts its effect directly or through Ca2+-binding proteins on plasma membrane and intracellular channels, intracellular proteins involved in membrane trafficking, and a broad range of enzymes, including kinases, phosphatases, and adenylyl cyclases. Ca2+-binding proteins sense changes in [Ca2+] through either 130-amino acid (aa)1 structural elements called C2 domains, 29-aa EF-hand motifs, or through acidic regions of proteins or protein-lipid interfaces. In a growing number of eukaryotic signaling proteins, C2 and EF-hand motifs are present as either a single copy or clustered in multiple copies (1.Nalefski E.A. Falke J.J. Protein Sci. 1996; 5: 2375-2390Crossref PubMed Scopus (691) Google Scholar). The largest group of Ca2+-binding proteins belongs to the calmodulin (CaM) superfamily. They are structurally related and comprise four EF-hand motifs, some of which (one or two) may be nonfunctional in Ca2+ coordination (2.Polans A. Baehr W. Palczewski K. Trends Neurosci. 1996; 19: 547-554Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (267) Google Scholar). Neuronal Ca2+-binding proteins (NCBP) are a subset of the EF-hand-containing proteins, whose function is largely unknown. The sequence similarity among members of the NCBP family varies from ∼25% between CaM and visinin to ∼60% between GCAP1 and GCAP3 (3.Haeseleer F. Sokal I. Li N. Pettenati M. Rao N. Bronson D. Wechter R. Baehr W. Palczewski K. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 6526-6535Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar). NCBPs are acidic and similar in length. CaM and CaM-like proteins are the shortest (149–150 aa; molecular mass, 16,837 Da); other members of this family are ∼200 aa long (molecular mass, ∼23,000 Da) (2.Polans A. Baehr W. Palczewski K. Trends Neurosci. 1996; 19: 547-554Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (267) Google Scholar). NCBPs also display a variety of interesting structural features. Multifunctional CaM contains a pair of N-terminal (EF-hand 1 and EF-hand 2) and C-terminal EF-hand (EF-hand 3 and EF-hand 4) motifs (4.Babu Y.S. Bugg C.E. Cook W.J. J. Mol. Biol. 1988; 204: 191-199Crossref PubMed Scopus (976) Google Scholar). The “dumbbell shape” of CaM undergoes a major conformational change upon Ca2+ coordination. These conformational changes result in reorientation of the two N- and C-terminal domains with respect to each other and a rearrangement of α-helices in the N-terminal domain that makes the hydrophobic target peptide binding site more accessible (5.Wriggers W. Mehler E. Pitici F. Weinstein H. Schulten K. Biophys. J. 1998; 74: 1622-1639Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar). The flexible region of the central α-helix bends and unwinds upon binding of CaM to many target proteins (6.Ikura M. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1996; 21: 14-17Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (599) Google Scholar). Myristoylated recoverin, hippocalcin, frequenin, GCAPs, and other Ca2+-binding proteins comprise a separate subset of NCBPs (2.Polans A. Baehr W. Palczewski K. Trends Neurosci. 1996; 19: 547-554Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (267) Google Scholar). Binding of Ca2+ to recoverin induces more subtle changes in its compact structure, including the unclamping and extrusion of the myristoyl group. This so-called “myristoyl switch” may be unique to recoverin; other myristoylated NCBPs, like GCAP2, appear to have their hydrophobic group exposed to solvent permanently (7.Hughes R.E. Brzovic P.S. Dizhoor A.M. Klevit R.E. Hurley J.B Protein Sci. 1998; 7: 2675-2680Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar, 8.Ames J.B. Dizhoor A.M. Ikura M. Palczewski K. Stryer L. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 19329-19337Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar). The transition is also accompanied by a 45° rotation of the N-terminal domain relative to the C-terminal domain, as well as the exposure of many hydrophobic residues (9.Ames J.B. Ishima R. Tanaka T. Gordon J.I. Stryer L. Ikura M. Nature. 1997; 11: 198-202Crossref Scopus (429) Google Scholar). The main chain folds of neurocalcin and GCAP2 are similar to Ca2+-bound recoverin, except for structural differences near the N terminus (residues 2–18) and the binding of Ca2+ to EF-4 (8.Ames J.B. Dizhoor A.M. Ikura M. Palczewski K. Stryer L. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 19329-19337Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar, 10.Vijay-Kumar S. Kumar V.D. Nat. Struct.

This protein, named “caldendrin,” is an uncommon member of the CaM superfamily possessing a predicted molecular mass of 33 kDa. The ultra-structural localization in dendrites and the postsynaptic density were interpreted as evidence of an association with the somatodendritic cytoskeleton. Yamaguchi et al. (12.Yamaguchi K. Yamaguchi F. Miyamoto O. Sugimoto K. Konishi R. Hatase O. Tokuda M J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 3610-3616Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar) reported the cloning of a 70-aa-long form of caldendrin, termed “calbrain,” containing two putative EF-hand motifs. No reference to the caldendrin studies was provided, and thus it is difficult to evaluate whether the authors considered calbrain as a novel gene or a spliced form of caldendrin. In situ hybridization studies revealed abundant expression of mRNA containing calbrain sequence in the hippocampus, in the habenular area of the epithalamus, and in the cerebellum. Calbrain antagonized CaM in stimulation of CaM kinase II. These two studies raised an important question about the relationship between caldendrin and calbrain. Here, we report characterization of five novel neuronal Ca2+-binding proteins: CaBP1, CaBP2, CaBP3, CaBP4, and CaBP5. These proteins display a new combination of functional EF-hand motifs and myristoylation. CaBP1, although structurally related to CaM, has a disabled EF2-hand motif and contains a consensus sequence for myristoylation. A large portion of the CaBP1 sequence is homologous to previously published caldendrin (11.Seidenbecher C.I. Langnaese K. Sanmarti-Vila L. Boeckers T.M. Smalla K.H. Sabel B.A. Garner C.C. Gundelfinger E.D. Kreutz M.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 21324-21331Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar) and calbrain (12.Yamaguchi K. Yamaguchi F. Miyamoto O. Sugimoto K. Konishi R. Hatase O. Tokuda M J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 3610-3616Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). We believe that caldendrin contains an extra sequence at the N terminus as a result of alternative splicing, although calbrain represents only a partial sequence of larger CaBP1. Retina-specific CaBP2 is expressed at low levels and is likely to be myristoylated. CaBP2 has a 3-aa deletion in the second EF-hand loop, possibly rendering it nonfunctional for Ca2+ binding. Insoluble human CaBP3 has an identical C-terminal segment as compared with CaBP5, contains only functional EF3- and EF4-hand motifs, and is partially encoded by the reverse and complementary DNA strand of the CaBP5 gene. mRNAs for both CaBP3 and CaBP5 were only found in the retina. This study reveals a much larger variety of genes encoding NCBPs, suggesting that these proteins may play significant roles in the physiology of neurons. Initially, expressed sequence tag (EST) data bases were searched with the query sequence that corresponded to the sequence of GCAP1 Ca2+-binding loops using tFasta in the GCG package (Genetics Computer Group). This search identified the AA363865 clone (M. D. Adams and colleagues, Institute for Genomic Research, Rockville, MD), which represents a partial sequence of CaBP1. TheAA363865 sequence and full-length sequences of CaBPs were used in further searches. CaBPs were cloned by PCR from human, bovine, and mouse retina libraries in two overlapping fragments using primers from selected EST clones or new partially cloned CaBPs. Most CaBPs were cloned by nested PCR, employing primers that hybridized to the arm of the vector and CaBP sequences. PCR were heated for 5 min at 94 °C, followed by 35 cycles at 94 °C for 30 s, at a temperature specific to the primers for 30 s, and at 68 °C for 2.5 min followed by 7 min at 68 °C. PCR products were cloned in pCRII-TOPO vector (TOPO TA Cloning Kit, Invitrogen) and sequenced by dyedeoxyterminator sequencing (ABI-Prism, Perkin-Elmer) or purified for direct sequencing. Total RNAs were isolated from human, bovine, or mouse retinal tissue using the UltraSpec RNA isolation system (Biotecx, Inc.). mRNAs were selected from those three RNA preparations using the mRNA separation kit (CLONTECH). Directional cDNA libraries were constructed using the SuperscriptTMplasmid system for cDNA synthesis and plasmid cloning (Life Technologies, Inc.) following the manufacturer's instructions. Some sequences of h-CaBPs were obtained by PCR using a λgt10 human retina cDNA library (J. Nathans, Johns Hopkins School of Medicine, Baltimore). Clone 44N10 (GenBankTM/EMBL accession number Z97197) was identified by searching the GenBankTM/EMBL data base with CaBP1 cDNA as a query. The gene structure was solved by comparing CaBP1 cDNA with this genomic clone. A BAC clone containing the CaBP2 gene was purchased from Genome Systems, Inc. Each intron was amplified separately by PCR using Takara LA Taq Polymerase (Fisher) through 35 cycles of 94 °C for 30 s, 54 °C for 30 s, and 68 °C for 20 min. Introns 1 and 2A were amplified with primers K49 (5′-CATATGGTTCAAGGGCCCATGGGAAA-3′) and K96 (5′-TTCAATCTCCTCGGGCCGC-3′); intron 2B with primers K95 (5′-GAGCTGCGGCCCGAGGAG-3′) and K63 (5′-GCTCCATCTCGGTGGGCATGTA-3′); intron 3 with K101 (5′-CGAGACCAGGACGGCTACAT-3′) and K98 (5′-CCCGGACACCGATCATGTC-3′); and introns 4 and 5 with K46 (5′-TTTGATGACTTTGTGGAGCTGATG-3′) and K16 (5′-TCAGCGAGACATCATCTTCACAAAC-3′). PCR products were sequenced directly or cloned into the pCRII-TOPO vector before sequencing by dyedeoxyterminator sequencing (ABI-Prism, Perkin-Elmer). A BAC clone containing the CaBP3and CaBP5 genes was purchased from Genome Systems, Inc. A fragment covering exons 1–3 of h-CaBPs genomic DNA was amplified with primers K45 and K40 using Takara LA Taq polymerase, cloned in pCRII-Topo vector, and sequenced by dyedeoxyterminator sequencing (ABI-Prism, Perkin-Elmer). Fragments covering exons 3–4, exons 3–5, or exons 3–6 of the h-CaBP5 gene were amplified with Takara LA Taq DNA polymerase with primers K54 (5′-GGATCTGGGGAATCTCATGAGGA-3′) and K28 (5′-GGTCATCAGCTCCACAAAGTCA-3′), K54 and K29 (5′-CTCCCGGACAACCTCAGAGATC-3′), or K54 and K16 (5′-TCAGCGAGACATCATCTTCACAAAC-3′), respectively. Purified fragments were directly sequenced with primers designed in the exons. Fragments covering exons 3–4, exons 4–5, or exons 5–6 of the h-CaBP3 gene were amplified with Takara LA Taqpolymerase, purified, and sequenced directly by dyedeoxyterminator sequencing. The genomic clone CIT-HSP-1337H24 (GenBankTM/EMBL accession number AC005849) was identified by searching the GenBankTM/EMBL data base with CaBPs cDNA as a query. The gene structure was solved by comparing CaBP cDNAs with this genomic clone. mRNAs were prepared from bovine retinas as described above (see “Construction of cDNA Libraries”). Northern blot was prepared and hybridized with32P-labeled h-CaBP1, h-CaBP2, h-CaBP5, or glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase cDNA probe as described previously (3.Haeseleer F. Sokal I. Li N. Pettenati M. Rao N. Bronson D. Wechter R. Baehr W. Palczewski K. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 6526-6535Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar). A human multiple tissue Northern (MTN) containing 2 μg of poly(A)+ RNA from various human tissue (CLONTECH) was hybridized according to the manufacturer's instructions. Master RNA blots containing poly(A)+ RNA from 50 human tissues (CLONTECH) were hybridized with32P-labeled h-CaBP1, h-CaBP2, or h-CaBP5 cDNA probes according to the manufacturer's instructions. Total RNA was isolated from diverse mouse tissues using the UltraSpec RNA isolation system (Biotecx, Inc.). cDNA was prepared by reverse transcription with oligo(dT) from 3 μg of total RNA in a 20-μl reaction (Life Technologies, Inc.). PCR were carried out using 0.5 μl of cDNA and the Expand high fidelity PCR system (Roche Molecular Biochemicals) for 35 cycles with primers K65 (5′-GATGGGCAACTGCGTCAAGTCG3-′) and K7 (5′-CGGCCTCAGCGGGACATCATCC-3′) for CaBP1 (94 °C for 30 s, 60 °C for 30 s, 68 °C for 1.5 min); primers K69 (5′-CATATGGTTCAGAGACCCATGG-3′) and K72 (5′-CTCAGCGAGACATCATNCG-3′) for CaBP2 (94 °C for 20 s, 50 °C for 30 s, 68 °C for 3 min); primers K60 (5′-CATATGGGTCCTGCCTGCATCTTC-3′) and K30 (5′-CTCCCCATCTCCATTGGCA-3′) for CaBP5 (94 °C for 30 s, 68 °C for 1.5 min); and primers G3PDH-F (5′-GAAGGGCTAATGACCACAGTCCAT-3′) and G3PDH-R (5′-TAGCCATATTCGTTGTCGATCCAGG-3′) for mouse G3PDH (94 °C for 30 s, 68 °C for 1.5 min). The localization of CaBP2 and CaBP3/5 was carried out by Genome Systems, Inc. using fluorescence in situ hybridization. DNA from CaBP clones were labeled with digoxigenin dUTP by nick translation. Labeled probes were combined with sheared human DNA and hybridized to normal metaphase chromosomes derived from phytohemagglutinin-stimulated peripheral blood lymphocytes in a solution containing 50% formamide, 10% dextran sulfate, and 2× SSC. Specific hybridization signals were detected by incubating the hybridized slides in fluoresceinated anti-digoxigenin antibodies followed by counter-staining with 4′,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole (DAPI). A second set of experiments was conducted in which genomic clones from the identified loci were co-hybridized with CaBP clones. Rabbit anti-CaBP polyclonal antibodies were raised in New Zealand White rabbits by subcutaneous immunization with ∼50 μg/50 μl of the antigen solution mixed with an equal volume of Freund's adjuvant (Cocalico Biologicals, Inc., Reamstown, PA). Animals were boosted at 1–2-week intervals with 25 μg of antigen solution mixed with complete Freund's adjuvant. UW72, UW73, and UW75 were raised against bacterially expressed C-terminal region of CaBP1 (aa 25–227), UW92 against bacterially expressed CaBP2, and UW89 against bacterially expressed CaBP5. Rabbit serum (6 ml) was diluted twice in 10 mm BTP, pH 7.5, containing 50 mm NaCl and loaded on respective CaBP-Sepharose (1 × 4 cm; 0.25 mg of protein/1 ml of the CNBr-activated Sepharose 4B). Columns were previously equilibrated in the same buffer. The antibody (∼4 mg) was eluted with 0.1 m Gly, pH 2.5. A retinal extract containing CaBPs was prepared by homogenizing 50 bovine retinas in 50 ml of water, containing 2 mm benzamidine and 20 μg/ml leupeptin. The extract was separated from retinal particulates by centrifugation (48,000 × g for 50 min) at 4 °C. The extract was then loaded onto a UW75 polyclonal antibodies-Sepharose column (affinity purified; 2 mg of antibody per 1 ml of CNBr-activated Sepharose; 1 × 2.5 cm) equilibrated with 10 mm BTP, pH 7.5, containing 2 mm benzamidine at a flow rate of 15 ml/h. The column was then washed successively with: 1) the BTP buffer containing 200 mm NaCl and 2) the BTP buffer alone. The elution was performed with 0.1 m Gly, pH 2.5, containing 2 mm benzamidine. Fractions (1 ml) were collected, immediately neutralized with 1 m Tris/HCl, pH 8.4 (0.2 ml/fraction), and analyzed by SDS-PAGE and immunoblot with the UW72 or UW75 polyclonal antibody (CaBP1) (diluted 1:1000). The fractions containing retinal CaBPs eluted from the affinity column were combined and concentrated to approximately 0.5 ml using a SpeedVac. CH3CN was then added to yield a final concentration of 15%, and the sample was loaded on a C4 column (W-Porex 5 C4, 4.6 × 150 mm, Phenomenex) equilibrated with 30% CH3CN in 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid. CaBPs were eluted with a linear gradient of CH3CN (30–60%) in 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid at a flow rate of 0.5 ml/min (0.5-ml fractions were collected). Final purification was obtained on a C8 column (Vydac 208TP52, 2.1 × 250 mm) equilibrated with 30% CH3CN in 5 mm BTP, pH 7.5. CaBPs were eluted with a linear gradient of CH3CN (30–60%) in 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid at a flow rate of 0.2 ml/min (0.2-ml fractions were collected). The separation of different forms of CaBPs was obtained on SDS-PAGE. Electrotransfer of proteins from SDS-polyacrylamide gels onto an Immobilon-PSQ transfer membrane (Millipore, Bedford, MA) was performed in 10 mm BTP, pH 8.4, containing 10% methanol at 90 V for 1 h at 4 °C. After transfer, the membrane was stained for 10 min with 0.1% Coomassie Brilliant Blue R-250 in 45% methanol, 10% acetic acid and then destained in 45% methanol, 7% acetic acid for approximately 10 min. The excised bands were in situ tryptic digested using 0.2 μg of sequencing grade trypsin (Promega) in 1% Zwittergent 3-16 (Calbiochem) in 0.1 m ammonium bicarbonate for 2 h at 37 °C (13.Lui M.

Selected peak fractions were analyzed by a combination of delayed extraction matrix-assisted laser-desorption/ionization reflectron time-of flight mass spectrometry (MALDI re-TOF MS; REFLEX III, Bruker-Franzen, Bremen, Germany) and automated Edman sequencing (model 477A, PE Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA) (15.Tempst P.

Peptide monoisotopic masses were summed from the identified residues using ProComp version 1.2 software (obtained from Dr. P. C. Andrews, University of Michigan, Ann Arbor, MI). The coding sequences for the long and short h-CaBP1 were amplified from human retina cDNA library by PCR using K57 (5′-CATATGGGCAACTGTGTCAAGTATCC-3′) and K7 (5′-CGGCCTCAGCGGGACATCATCC-3′) through 35 cycles at 94 °C for 30 s, 68 °C for 1.5 min. The coding sequence for b-CaBP1 was amplified from bovine retina cDNA library with primers K53 (5′-CATATGGGAAACTGTGCCAAGCGGCC-3′), which placed an NdeI site on the ATG and K8 (5′-TCAGTGATGGTGATGGTGATGGCGGGACATCATCCGGACAAA-3′), which adds a His6 tag at the C terminus of the protein. The PCRs were cycled 35 times at 94 °C for 30 s, 56 °C for 30 s, and 68 °C for 2 min. The coding sequence for m-CaBP5 was amplified from the mouse retina cDNA library with primers K42 (5′-CATATGCAGTTTCCAATGGGTCCTG-3′) and either K16 (5′-TCAGCGAGACATCATCTTCACAAAC-3′) or either K17 (5′-TCAGTGATGGTGATGGTGATGGCGAGACATCATCTTCACAAACTC-3′), which adds a Ths6 tag at the C terminus of the protein. The reactions were cycled 35 times through 94 °C for 30 s, 60 °C for 30 s, and 68 °C for 1.5 min. The short form of m-CaBP5 (without 1–4 aa) was amplified with primers K60 (5′-CATATGGGTCCTGCCTGCATCTTC-3′) and K16 (5′-TCAGCGAGACATCATCTTCACAAAC-3′) at 94 °C for 30 s, 60 °C for 30 s, and 68 °C for 1.5 min. The PCR product for each CaBP was cloned in the pCRII-TOPO vector and sequenced by dyedeoxyterminator sequencing (ABI-Prism, Perkin-Elmer). The coding sequences were cloned as fragments NdeI-BamHI in the pET-3b vector (Novagen). CaBPs were expressed in BL21 bacteria after induction with 0.2 mmisopropyl-β-d-thiogalactopyranoside. CaBPs were produced in E. coli cotransfected with N-terminal myristoyltransferase (18.Rudnicka-Nawrot M. Surgucheva I. Hulmes J.D. Haeseleer F. Sokal I. Crabb J.W. Baehr W. Palczewski K.

Expressions of CaBPs were then induced with 1 mmisopropyl-β-d-thiogalactopyranoside and grown at 37 °C for 4 h. Proteins were purified on Ni2+-NTA resin (CaBP2, CaBP5 and S-CaBP5) or on DEAE cellulose (S-CaBP1, L-CaBP1) and stained with Coomassie Blue. Bands with CaBPs were excised from the gel and dissolved in 30% H2O2, and mixtures were subjected for scintillation counting. bGRK2 and hGRK5 were overexpressed and purified from Sf9 cells as described (19.Kim C.M.

GRK-mediated phosphorylation was assayed by incubating 0.8 pmol of GRK with either rod outer segment membranes (40 pmol of rhodopsin) or casein (5 μg) in 20 μl of 20 mm Tris/HCl, pH 8.0, 6 mm MgCl2, 0.1 mm CaCl2 (or 2 mm EGTA, where indicated) and 0.1 mm [γ-32P]ATP (1,000 cpm/pmol) in the presence of indicated concentrations of CaBPs or CaM for 4 min at 30 °C in room light. The reactions were stopped with 5 μl of SDS sample buffer and electrophoresed on 10% SDS-polyacrylamide gel. Gels were stained with Coomassie Blue, dried, and autoradiographed, and the 32P-labeled proteins were excised and counted. CMV promoter isolated as a fragmentBglII-XhoI from the pcDNA 3.1 vector was cloned between the sites BglII-XhoI of pEGFP-1 vector, giving pEGFPF-1. The coding sequence for h-CaBP1, with part of the 5′-untranslated region and without stop codon, was amplified from human retina cDNA library with primers K85 (5′-AGCCTCCTTCATGGACCC-3′) and K94 (5′-GCGGGACATCATCCGGAC-3′). The PCR were cycled 35 times at 94 °C for 30 s, 55 °C for 30 s, and 68 °C for 2 min. Both PCR products (0.5 and 0.7 kb) were cloned in pCRII-TOPO vector and sequenced by dyedeoxyterminator sequencing (ABI-Prism, Perkin-Elmer). Both the short form (Sh-CaBP1) and the long form (Lh-CaBP1) of CaBP1 were cloned as a fragmentEcoRI-EcoRI in pEGFPF-1 openedXhoI-EcoRI. Twenty micrograms of pcDNA3.1, pEGFPF-1, pSh-CaBP1-GFP, or pLh-CaBP1-GFP were transiently transfected into 50–80% confluent CHO cells using co-precipitates of calcium phosphate and DNA (21.Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. 2nd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989: 16.30-16.36Google Scholar). Three days after transfection, cells were plated on glass coverslips, placed in culture dishes, and incubated overnight at 37 °C. Four days after transfection, fluorescent transfected cells were analyzed with a Bio-Rad MRC-600 confocal microscope. Adult C57BL/6 mice were anesthetized with sodium pentobarbitol (Nembutol) delivered by intraperitoneal injection. Animals were perfused transcardially with 20 ml of 4% formaldehyde in 86 mm NaPO4, pH 7.3. Eyes were removed and incised at the limbus to facilitate rapid fixation of the retina. After 10 min in fixative, the anterior segments and lenses were dissected from the eyes, and the eye cups were returned to the fixative. Eyes were immersed in 4% formaldehyde in 86 mm NaPO4, pH 7.3, for 4 h on ice. Residual aldehydes were removed by washing eye cups repeatedly in 137 mm NaPO4, pH 7.3 (3 × 20 min). Retinal tissue was prepared for confocal immunofluorescence labeling according to Hale and Matsumoto (22.Hale I., L. Matsumoto B. Methods Cell Biol. 1993; 38: 289-324Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). Briefly, eye cups or peeled retinas were embedded in disposable weigh-boats containing molten low gel temperature agarose (5%) (Sigma) in phosphate-buffered saline containing 0.05% sodium azide at ∼40 °C. Agarose was solidified on ice for 1 h. Agarose blocks containing retinal tissue were trimmed and attached to metal stubs with cyanoacrylate adhesive. A Leica vibrating microtome was used to cut 100-μm sections of tissue, which were transferred to phosphate-buffered saline prior to immunolabeling. To reduce nonspecific labeling, retinal sections were incubated for 1 h in ICC buffer (phosphate-buffered saline, 0.5% bovine serum albumin, 0.5% Triton X-100, 0.01% sodium azide, pH 7.3), containing 5% normal goat serum. Sera from rabbits used for CaBP antibody production were diluted in ICC buffer as follows: UW72/CaBP1, 1:200; UW89/CaBP5, 1:400. Sections were incubated in primary antibody for 12 h at 4 °C. A monoclonal antibody to PKC (MC5 clone, Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) was diluted 1:50 and used for double-labeling studies to identify rod bipolar cells. Sections were then washed repeatedly in ICC buffer (3 × 20 min/1 × 60 min). Sections were incubated for 4 h in Cy3-conjugated goat anti-rabbit antibody (Jackson ImmunoResearch, West Grove, PA) diluted 1:200 in ICC buffer and subsequently washed in ICC buffer 3 × 20 min and 1 × 60 min. Sections were coverslipped in 50 μl of 5% n-propyl gallate in glycerol to retard photobleaching. Sections were analyzed and images collected using a Bio-Rad 600 laser scanning confocal microscope located at the W. M. Keck Center for Advanced Studies of Neural Signaling (University of Washington School of Medicine). Negative controls for immunolabeling studies included each of the following steps: omission of primary antibody; incubation in preimmune sera at matching dilutions from rabbits used for polyclonal production; and adsorbed controls using purified CaBP1 (for UW72) or CaBP5 (UW89) (600 nmfinal concentration) to abolish immunolabeling. The protein concentration was determined by the Bradford method (23.Bradford M.M. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 72: 248-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (216440) Google Scholar). SDS-PAGE was performed according to Laemmli (24."

In vitro, HGF increases the insulin content and proliferation of islets. To study the role of HGF in the islet in vivo, we have developed three lines of transgenic mice overexpressing mHGF using the rat insulin II promoter (RIP). Each RIP-HGF transgenic line displays clear expression of HGF mRNA and protein in the islet. RIP-mHGF mice are relatively hypoglycemic in post-prandial and fasting states compared with their normal littermates. They display inappropriate insulin production, striking overexpression of insulin mRNA in the islet, and a 2-fold increase in the insulin content in islet extracts. Importantly, beta cell replication rates in vivo are two to three times higher in RIP-HGF mice. This increase in proliferation results in a 2–3-fold increase in islet mass. Moreover, the islet number per pancreatic area was also increased by approximately 50%. Finally, RIP-mHGF mice show a dramatically attenuated response to the diabetogenic effects of streptozotocin. We conclude that the overexpression of HGF in the islet increases beta cell proliferation, islet number, beta cell mass, and total insulin production in vivo. These combined effects result in mild hypoglycemia and resistance to the diabetogenic effects of streptozotocin.

It is now recognized that HGF also exhibits its mitogenic, motogenic, and morphogenic activities in a wide variety of cells (4.Zarnegar R. Michalopoulos G.K. J.

The active form of HGF is a disulfide-linked heterodimeric protein, which is composed of a 69-kDa α-chain and a 34-kDa β-chain, containing four kringle domains and a serine protease-like domain, respectively. Active HGF derives from an inactive single chain precursor that is processed and activated by proteolysis. Four proteases have been reported to date to activate HGF in vitro, including blood coagulation factor XIIa, urokinase, tissue-type plasminogen activator, and a serum-derived serine protease named HGF activator (6.Shimomura T.

HGF is primarily a paracrine factor produced by mesenchymal cells that acts on epithelial cells through a membrane-spanning tyrosine kinase receptor, the protein product of the proto-oncogene, c-met (5.Matsumoto K. Nakamura T. J. Biochem. (Tokyo). 1996; 119: 591-600Crossref PubMed Scopus (615) Google Scholar, 10.Bottaro D.P. Rubin J.S. Faletto D.L. Chan A.M.L. Kmiecik T.E. Vande Woude G.F. Aaronson S.A.

Messenger RNAs encoding HGF and the HGF receptor, c-met, are highly expressed during the early development of the pancreas, and then maintained at a low level during puberty and adult life (12.Sonnenberg E. Meyer D. Weidner M. Birchmeier C. J. Cell Biol. 1993; 123: 223-235Crossref PubMed Scopus (640) Google Scholar, 13.Calvo E.L. Boucher C. Pelletier G. Morisset J. Biochem. Biophys. Res.

HGF has been detected immunohistochemically in the exocrine portion of rabbit pancreas, and in rat and human pancreatic islet cells (15.Zarnegar R. Muga S. Rahija R. Michalopoulos G. Proc. Natl.

Tissue-type plasminogen activator has been detected in the rat endocrine pancreas, preferentially in somatostatin cells (18.Kristensen P. Nielsen J.H. Larsson L.I. Dano K. Endocrinology. 1987; 121: 2238-2244Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). In addition, confocal immunofluorescent studies have preferentially colocalized the c-Met receptor protein to insulin-containing cells in the islet (14.Otonkoski T. Cirulli V. Beattie G.M. Mally M.I. Soto G. Rubin J.S. Hayek A. Endocrinology. 1996; 137: 3131-3139Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). A recent report has shown that fetal pancreatic mesenchyme stimulates the proliferation of neonatal islet cell clusters in culture (14.Otonkoski T. Cirulli V. Beattie G.M. Mally M.I. Soto G. Rubin J.S. Hayek A. Endocrinology. 1996; 137: 3131-3139Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Moreover, the addition of anti-HGF antiserum to the culture medium inhibited the islet mitogenic effect present in the pancreatic mesenchyme. Experiments performed in vitro by the same group have demonstrated that HGF is a mitogen and an insulinotropic agent for islet cells, not only in fetal islets, but also in adult islets (19.Otonkoski T.

In addition, HGF is able to increase the expression of Reg, a protein implicated in pancreatic regeneration, in human fetal islets (22.Otonkoski T. Mally M.I. Hayek A. Diabetes. 1994; 43: 1164-1166Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Finally, HGF alone or in combination with activin A, is able to convert pancreatic acinar AR42J cells into insulin-producing cells (23.Mashima H. Shibata H. Mine T. Kojima I. Endocrinology. 1996; 137: 3969-3976Crossref PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar). The identification of islet growth factors is an important requirement for successful transplantation of pancreatic islets in diabetes (24.Bonner-Weir S. Smith F.E. Trends Endocrinol.

A number of candidates, including glucose, growth hormone (GH), prolactin, placental lactogen, the Reg family of proteins, insulin-like growth factor I and II, islet neogenesis associated protein, transforming growth factor α, gastrin, parathyroid hormone-related protein, and HGF have been examined as regulators of islet cell proliferation in vitro and/or in vivo(14.Otonkoski T.

Among these factors, prolactin, placental lactogen, and HGF seem to be the most potent activators of islet cell growth in vitro (14.Otonkoski T. Cirulli V. Beattie G.M. Mally M.I. Soto G. Rubin J.S.

In order to determine whether local overexpression of HGF in the islet could result in an increase in islet mass and/or function in vivo, we have developed a transgenic mouse model of HGF overexpression in the islet using the rat insulin II promoter (RIP). We found that overexpression of HGF in the islet induces mild hypoglycemia, inappropriate hyperinsulinemia, and an increase in islet mass, reflecting an increase both in the number of islets as well as in the proliferation of beta cells. Interestingly, RIP-HGF mice show a dramatically attenuated response to the diabetogenic effects of streptozotocin. These results suggest that HGF could be useful in strategies focused on increasing islet mass and function in diabetes. RIP-HGF mice were generated as described previously for the RIP-parathyroid hormone-related protein transgenic mouse (33.Vasavada R.C. Cavaliere C. D'Ercole A.J. Dann P. Burtis W.J. Madlener A.L.

Briefly, the RIP-HGF transgene was constructed by placing a 2.2-kilobase murine HGF cDNA (generously provided by Dr. Jumpei Enami at Zenyaku Kogyo Co, Tokyo, Japan) downstream of a fragment of 650 bp of the RIP, and upstream of untranslated human growth hormone sequences containing transcriptional termination, polyadenylation, and splicing signals; the GH sequences are not translated (35.Wysolmerski J.J.

The 2.2-kilobase mHGF cDNA contained the entire coding region of murine HGF. The resulting linearized construct (5.1 kilobase) was isolated, purified, and then microinjected into the pronuclei of (C57B16 × SJL) F2 mouse ova. Potential founders were screened by polymerase chain reaction analysis of tail DNA using human growth hormone-specific primers designed from the human growth hormone gene sequences (36.Weir E.C.

Polymerase chain reaction efficiency was assessed by coamplification of a fragment of the endogenous murine glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase gene (36.Weir E.C. Philbrick W.M. Amling M.

Transgenic lines with germ line integration of the transgene were propagated by breeding to CD-1 outbred mice. All of the studies described in this manuscript were performed on mice between 8 and 14 weeks of age. All studies were performed with the approval of, and in accordance with, guidelines established by the University of Pittsburgh Animal Care and Use Committee. Tissues were harvested from control and transgenic mice and immediately frozen in liquid nitrogen. Total RNA was then isolated using Trizol reagent (Life Technologies, Inc., Grand Island, NY) according to the manufacturer's instructions. RNase protection assay was performed as described previously (33.Vasavada R.C. Cavaliere C. D'Ercole A.J. Dann P. Burtis W.J. Madlener A.L. Zawalich K. Zawalich W. Philbrick W. Stewart A.F. J. Biol.

Blood was obtained by retroorbital bleeding as described previously (33.Vasavada R.C. Cavaliere C. D'Ercole A.J. Dann P. Burtis W.J. Madlener A.L. Zawalich K. Zawalich W. Philbrick W. Stewart A.F. J.

Glucose was measured on whole blood using a Precision Q.I.D. glucometer (Medisense Inc., Bedford, MA). Plasma insulin levels were determined by radioimmunoassay using a kit purchased from Linco Research Inc. (St. Louis, MO). The detection limit of the assay is 0.02 ng/ml. Mouse islets were isolated from 8–14-week-old control and transgenic mice as described previously (37.Gotoh M. Maki T. Kiyoizumi T. Satomi S. Monaco A.P. Transplantation. 1985; 40: 437-438Crossref PubMed Scopus (536) Google Scholar). Protein extracts were prepared using the acid/ethanol method (38.Davalli A.M. Qgawa Y. Scaglia L. Wu Y.J. Hollister J. Bonner-Weir S. Weir G.C. Diabetes. 1995; 44: 104-111Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), with some modifications. Briefly, acid/ethanol (0.18m HCl in 70% ethanol) was added to aliquots of 25 to 50 islets, sonicated 15 s, and extracted at 4 °C for 24 h. Tubes were then centrifuged at 2500 rpm for 10 min at 4 °C, and the supernatant stored at −20 °C. After neutralization, the insulin content in the extracts was measured using the insulin radioimmunoassay as described above. Protein concentrations in the islet extracts were determined using the Bradford method. Insulin concentrations are expressed as a function of the amount of protein in the islet extract. Pancreata were removed, fixed overnight in 10% buffered formalin or Bouin's solution, and embedded in paraffin. Sections were obtained and stained with hematoxylin and eosin using standard techniques. Immunostaining for insulin, glucagon, pancreatic polypeptide, and somatostatin was performed as previously reported (33.Vasavada R.C. Cavaliere C. D'Ercole A.J. Dann P. Burtis W.J. Madlener A.L.

HGF was detected in pancreatic sections subjected to antigen retrieval by heating in citrate buffer (1.8 mm citric acid, pH 6.0, 8.2 mm sodium citrate) in a microwave oven at 750 W for 5 min. Subsequently, sections were immunostained with an affinity purified goat anti-human HGF polyclonal antibody (Santa Cruz) at a 1:50 dilution. Visualization of the staining was achieved using the species-appropriate avidin-biotin complex system as described previously (39.Soifer N.E. Van Why S.K. Ganz M.B. Kashgarian M. Seigel N.J. Stewart A.F. J. Clin. Invest. 1993; 92: 2850-2857Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). Histomorphometric analysis on insulin-stained sections from normal and transgenic mice was performed as previously reported (40.Stewart A.F. Vignery A. Silvergate A. Ravin N.D. LiVolsi V. Broadus A.E. Baron R. J. Clin. Endocrinol. Metab. 1982; 55: 219-227Crossref PubMed Scopus (226) Google Scholar). Briefly, quantitation of islet number and islet volume as a function of pancreatic volume was performed in insulin-stained sections by using a Nikon (Nikon Inc., New York, NY) Labophot microscope coupled to an Osteotablet (Osteometrics, Atlanta GA) planimeter and analyzed with Osteomeasure software package (Osteometrics). Beta cell replication was determined by 5-bromo-2′-deoxyuridine (BrdUrd) incorporation as described previously (41.Montana E. Bonner-Weir S. Weir G.C. J. Clin. Invest. 1994; 93: 1577-1582Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar), with minor modifications. Briefly, transgenic and normal littermates were injected intraperitoneally with BrdUrd (Cell Proliferation Kit, Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) and sacrificed after 6 h. Pancreata were removed and immediately fixed in Bouin's solution for 6 h, and then embedded, sectioned, deparaffinized, and stained with anti-BrdUrd antibody (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech), and with antibodies against glucagon, pancreatic polypeptide (BioGenex, San Ramon, CA), and somatostatin (Novocastra Laboratories, Newcastle upon Tyne, United Kingdom). After counterstaining with hematoxylin, the sections were counted in a blinded fashion. Islet cells which stained for BrdUrd but not glucagon, pancreatic polypeptide or somatostatin were considered BrdUrd positive beta cells. At least 1000 islet nuclei were counted per pancreas. The results are expressed as the percentage of BrdUrd-positive beta cell nuclei per total number of beta cell nuclei. RIP-HGF transgenic mice and their normal littermates were injected intraperitoneally with two doses of 75 mg/kg streptozotocin (STZ) (Roche Molecular Biochemicals, Indianapolis, IN) separated by 12–16 h. Tail blood glucoses were measured at baseline and after STZ injections at the time points shown in Fig. 9 with the Precision Q.I.D. glucometer. All results are expressed as mean ± S.D. Statistical analysis was performed using the unpaired Student's t test. Nine founder RIP-HGF transgenic mice were identified. Two of these were mosaics and failed to transmit the transgene to their progeny. One female founder died during her first pregnancy. Thus, six lines with germ line integration of the transgene were obtained, with a range of approximately two to 30 transgene copies. Murine HGF mRNA expression in the pancreas of the six transgenic lines was analyzed by RNase protection assay. Three mouse lines displayed high levels of transgene expression when compared with the other three lines or with the very low expression detected in the normal pancreas (Fig. 1). Prolonged (96 h) exposure was necessary to visualize the expression of endogenous murine HGF mRNA in normal pancreas. The three highest expressors, lines 48, 51, and 54 were bred separately from one another, but because of their similar phenotypes, data from these lines were pooled, except where indicated. To confirm that RIP-HGF mice also overexpress HGF at the protein level, we performed immunohistochemical analysis of HGF expression in the islet of normal and transgenic pancreas. As can be seen in Fig.2, HGF is overexpressed in the islet cells of transgenic mouse pancreas, compared with the level of staining detected in the islet of normal mice (Fig. 2). As can be seen in Fig.3 A, blood glucose concentrations were significantly lower in RIP-HGF mice in both non-fasting and 24-h fasting conditions compared with the glucose concentrations observed in normal mice. The values shown in Fig.3 A represent the mean of the three transgenic lines. Each of the three lines display hypoglycemia of comparable degree. Given the relative hypoglycemia in the RIP-HGF mice in both states, one would expect lower plasma insulin values in the transgenic mice compared with the controls. Surprisingly, in both fasting and non-fasting situations, the plasma insulin values were not lower in the RIP-HGF mice than in their normal siblings (Fig. 3 B). Moreover, the insulin/glucose ratio was significantly higher in the RIP-HGF mice than in normal in post-prandial conditions, and slightly (but not significantly) higher at the 24-h fasted state (Fig.3 C). Immunohistochemical analysis performed using antisera against insulin, glucagon, somatostatin, and pancreatic polypeptide is shown in Fig.4. The pattern of distribution and the intensity of staining of these peptides in the islet of RIP-HGF mice were normal. No distribution or quantitative differences were observed in the staining of these islet hormones between transgenics and their normal littermates. To determine the level of expression of insulin mRNA in the RIP-HGF mice, we performed RNase protection analysis of islet total RNA from these mice and their normal siblings. We found that the steady-state insulin mRNA levels were 4–7-fold higher in the three lines of RIP-HGF mice compared with the corresponding controls (Fig.5 A). To confirm the insulin overexpression, we determined the insulin content in islet extracts by radioimmunoassay. We found that the amount of insulin expressed as a function of total islet protein, an index of insulin expression per beta cell, in RIP-HGF mice was approximately two times higher than in normal littermates (Fig. 5 B). Histological examination of insulin-stained sections from normal and transgenic pancreas suggested that the islet size in RIP-HGF mice was increased compared with the size observed in the normal littermates (Fig. 6 A). To document whether the islet mass was increased, we performed a blinded systematic quantitative histomorphometric analysis of pancreatic sections obtained from normal and transgenic mice. We found that the islet volume per unit of pancreatic volume was increased 2–3-fold in the RIP-HGF mice as compared with their littermates (Fig.6 B). Importantly, no significant differences were observed in either the overall size or in the total pancreatic volume between normal and transgenic mice, indicating that the increase in islet volume in these pancreatic sections is not the result of the decrease in exocrine volume. In addition, the islet number expressed as a function of pancreatic area was also increased by 50% in RIP-HGF mice (Fig. 6 C). As shown in Fig. 6, B andC, these changes in islet volume and number were observed in each of the three transgenic lines. Together, these results suggest that the individual islet size is increased in the RIP-HGF mice. In vitro studies have suggested that HGF is a potent mitogen for fetal and adult human beta cells (14.Otonkoski T. Cirulli V. Beattie G.M. Mally M.I. Soto G. Rubin J.S. Hayek A. Endocrinology. 1996; 137: 3131-3139Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 19.Otonkoski T. Beattie G.M. Rubin J.S. Lopez A.D. Baird A. Hayek A. Diabetes. 1994; 43: 947-953Crossref PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar,20.Hayek A. Beattie G.M. Cirulli V. Lopez A.D. Ricordi C. Rubin J.S. Diabetes. 1995; 44: 1458-1460Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Moreover, the RIP-HGF mice display a dramatic increase in islet mass (Fig. 6). We therefore determined the pancreatic beta cell proliferation rate in vivo by measuring BrdUrd incorporation into the pancreatic beta cell nuclei of RIP-HGF mice and their normal littermates. As shown in Fig. 7, the beta cell replication rate was increased by a factor of 2.5 in RIP-HGF mice compared with normal siblings. This increase in the proliferation rate was observed in each of the three lines. This indicates that an increase in the islet beta cell proliferation rate is likely at least one of the mechanisms through which islet mass is increased in the RIP-HGF mice. To explore the possible therapeutic role of HGF in diabetes mellitus, we studied the response of RIP-HGF mice to experimental diabetes induced by the diabetogenic agent, STZ. RIP-HGF transgenic mice and normal littermates were injected intraperitoneally with a dose of STZ that induces prompt hyperglycemia in normal mice. As shown in Fig. 8, normal mice developed frank diabetes with the injection of STZ. Three weeks after the injection with STZ the blood glucose was 450 ± 46 mg/dl. In contrast, RIP-HGF showed an attenuated response to STZ, displaying mild hyperglycemia 3 weeks post-injection (211 ± 37 mg/dl). In the present study we have found that overexpression of HGF in the islet of transgenic mice induces an impressive increase in the islet mass, and is associated with mild, relative hypoglycemia and inappropriate hyperinsulinemia. These in vivo results extend previous in vitro findings suggesting that HGF is one of the most potent mitogens and insulinotropic agents for beta cells (14.Otonkoski T. Cirulli V. Beattie G.M.

Pathol. 1995; 147: 889-895PubMed Google Scholar) and the c-Met receptor is localized in the islet beta cells (14.Otonkoski T. Cirulli V. Beattie G.M. Mally M.I. Soto G. Rubin J.S. Hayek A. Endocrinology. 1996; 137: 3131-3139Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), it seems likely that HGF may play a paracrine and/or autocrine physiological role in the growth and development of the pancreatic islet. HGF is known to possess potent mitogenic, motogenic, and morphogenic properties in many different cell types (4.Zarnegar R. Michalopoulos G.K. J. Cell Biol. 1995; 129: 1177-1180Crossref PubMed Scopus (553) Google Scholar, 5.Matsumoto K. Nakamura T. J. Biochem. (Tokyo). 1996; 119: 591-600Crossref PubMed Scopus (615) Google Scholar). Recently, it has also been demonstrated that HGF prevents cell death in normal renal epithelial cells and hepatocytes (42.Liu Y. Sun A.M. Dworkin L.D. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1998; 246: 821-826Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar, 43.Kosai K. Matsumoto K. Nagata S. Tsujimoto Y. Nakamura T. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1998; 244: 683-690Crossref PubMed Scopus (185) Google Scholar). In fact, HGF induces Bcl-xL and BAG-1 overexpression, and enhances protection from apoptosis. In our study we have observed that RIP-HGF mice almost tripled their pancreatic islet mass compared with control littermates. This augmentation seems to be the result of both an increase in beta cell proliferation rate and an increase in the islet number per pancreas. However, inhibitory effects of HGF on the already low normal apoptotic rate in the beta cells in the adult pancreas (44.Scaglia L. Smith F.E. Bonner-Weir S. Endocrinology. 1995; 136: 5461-5468Crossref PubMed Scopus (193) Google Scholar) have not been excluded. Along these lines, RIP-HGF mice are more resistant to the development of streptozotocin-induced diabetes than their normal littermates. STZ is a diabetogenic drug that behaves as a DNA alkylating agent or as a nitric oxide donor (45.Eizirik D.L. Sandler S. Ahnstrom G. Welsh M. Biochem. Pharmacol. 1991; 42: 2275-2282Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar, 46.Turk J. Corbett J.A. Ramanadham S. Bohrer A. McDaniel M.L. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1993; 197: 1458-1464Crossref PubMed Scopus (182) Google Scholar) inducing DNA fragmentation in beta cells (47.Yamamoto H. Uchigata Y. Okamoto H. Nature. 1981; 294: 284-286Crossref PubMed Scopus (476) Google Scholar), an indication that these cells undergo apoptosis after the treatment with this drug. The anti-apoptotic properties and/or the mitogenic effects of HGF could contribute to this resistance to, or the attenuation of, the diabetogenic effects of STZ in RIP-HGF mice. Alternatively, one might argue that the dose selected of STZ was lethal to a fixed number of islet cells, and since RIP-HGF have more islet cells than their normal siblings, the residual population of functional islet cells in the RIP-HGF mice remained sufficient to prevent or attenuate the development of diabetes mellitus. Further studies will be required to clarify the mechanism responsible for this protective effect. In addition to an increase in the islet mass, the RIP-HGF mice also show a significant increase in the number of islets per pancreatic area. Otonkoski and collagues (22.Otonkoski T. Mally M.I. Hayek A. Diabetes. 1994; 43: 1164-1166Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) have demonstrated that the culture of human fetal islet-like cell clusters with HGF leads to a dramatic increase in the expression of Reg, a protein expressed in the islet beta cells which may be involved in pancreatic islet growth and regeneration (48.Watanabe T. Yonemura Y. Yonekura H. Suzuki Y. Miyashita H. Sugiyama K. Moriizumi S. Unno M. Tanaka O. Kondo H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 3589-3592Crossref PubMed Scopus (235) Google Scholar). The increase in islet number in RIP-HGF mice could be also the result of a direct effect on the differentiation of ductal precursor cells into pancreatic endocrine cells. For example, a recent report demonstrates that HGF is able to block the differentiation of acinar/endocrine AR42J cells to acinar-like cells, and to promote their conversion into insulin-producing cells (23.Mashima H. Shibata H. Mine T. Kojima I. Endocrinology. 1996; 137: 3969-3976Crossref PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar). Also, Otonkoski et al. (19.Otonkoski T. Beattie G.M. Rubin J.S. Lopez A.D. Baird A. Hayek A. Diabetes. 1994; 43: 947-953Crossref PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar), have shown that HGF augments the formation of islet-like cell clusters in human fetal pancreatic tissue in culture. Taken together, these results suggest that HGF could act as a differentiation factor for the pancreatic islet and may promote islet neogenesis. RIP-HGF mice also display mild, relative hypoglycemia that appears to result from inappropriate hyperinsulinemia. Evidence for inappropriate hyperinsulinemia includes the failure of circulating insulin to suppress with hypoglycemia and the near-doubling of islet insulin content in the islet extracts from RIP-HGF mice. A possible mechanism responsible of this inappropriate hyperinsulinemia could be the result of random insertional events relating to the location of the transgene in the mouse genome. It is unlikely that this is the case since three independent transgenic lines expressing similar levels of HGF exhibited the same phenotype. It seems that the resulting hypoglycemia and inappropriate hyperinsulinemia appear to be specifically related to the expression of HGF in the pancreatic islet. This expression was accompanied by an increase in the levels of insulin mRNA and insulin peptide content in the islet. In addition, the pattern and intensity of staining for glucagon, somatostatin, or pancreatic polypeptide in normal and transgenic mice were identical. The observed increase in islet mass would appear to be responsible for the inappropriate hyperinsulinemia and mild hypoglycemia in the RIP-HGF mice. Abnormalities in beta cell glucose sensing, insulin biosynthesis rate, or insulin secretion mechanism within the islet beta cell, directly or indirectly induced by HGF expression, may also contribute to the inappropriate hyperinsulinemia in the RIP-HGF mice. The disproportionate increments in insulin protein and insulin mRNA levels within the islet were particularly striking, and are unexplained. It may be that HGF interferes with insulin biosynthesis, and/or that some degree of de-differentiation of beta cells occurs with HGF overexpression. Alternatively, a trivial explanation may be that beta cells degranulate during islet isolation inducing a falsely low estimate of islet insulin content. From a practical standpoint the net result is that, in RIP-HGF mice, sufficient quantities of insulin are produced to induce hypoglycemia. The explanation for this insulin protein/mRNA dissonance is worthy of exploration, however, as it may represent an additional target for enhancing RIP-HGF islet insulin secretion. Further studies will need to be performed to clarify these issues. In summary, our studies indicate that HGF may play a physiological role as a regulator of islet cell growth and differentiation. The increase in islet mass induced by HGF overexpression in the islet beta cells, perhaps accompanied by additional functional changes within the beta cells, would appear to be responsible of the observed mild, relative hypoglycemia and inappropriate hyperinsulinemia. We conclude that HGF, as other islet growth factors such as parathyroid hormone-related protein and mPL-I, are good candidates for future strategies aimed at the treatment of diabetes mellitus.

https://openalex.org/W2007780468,"αA-Crystallin, a member of the small heat shock protein (sHsp) family, is a large multimeric protein composed of 30–40 identical subunits. Its quaternary structure is highly dynamic, with subunits capable of freely and rapidly exchanging between oligomers. We report here the development of a fluorescence resonance energy transfer method for measuring structural compatibility between αA-crystallin and other proteins. We found that Hsp27 and αB-crystallin readily exchanged with fluorescence-labeled αA-crystallin, but not with other proteins structurally unrelated to sHsps. Truncation of 19 residues from the N terminus or 10 residues from the C terminus of αA-crystallin did not significantly change its subunit organization or exchange rate constant. In contrast, removal of the first 56 or more residues converts αA-crystallin into a predominantly small multimeric form consisting of three or four subunits, with a concomitant loss of exchange activity. These findings suggest residues 20–56 are essential for the formation of large oligomers and the exchange of subunits. Similar results were obtained with truncated Hsp27 lacking the first 87 residues. We further showed that the exchange rate is independent of αA-crystallin concentration, suggesting subunit dissociation may be the rate-limiting step in the exchange reaction. Our findings reveal a quarternary structure of αA-crystallin, consisting of small multimers of αA-crystallin subunits in a dynamic equilibrium with the oligomeric complex. αA-Crystallin, a member of the small heat shock protein (sHsp) family, is a large multimeric protein composed of 30–40 identical subunits.

Although the exact mechanism of protection against stress and cell death is still unknown, current evidence suggests αB-crystallin and Hsp27 may perform similar physiological functions.Like many other members of the small heat shock protein family, α-crystallin and Hsp27 exist as high molecular mass complexes consisting of a large number of subunits (8.Jaffe N.S. Horwitz J. Lens and Cataract. Gower Medical Publishing, 1991Google Scholar, 57.Behlke J. Lutsch G. Gaestel M. Bielka H. FEBS Lett. 1991; 288: 119-122Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). However, the size of these complexes can change depending on a number of physical and chemical parameters such as temperature, pH, and ionic strength, as well as the phosphorylation state of the protein (58.Tardieu A.

Using fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET) to monitor subunit-subunit interaction, we have previously shown that the subunits of αA-crystallin can freely and reversibly exchange between oligomers (67.Bova M.P. Ding L.L. Horwitz J. Fung B.K.-K. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 29511-29517Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (267) Google Scholar). In this study we further demonstrate by this method that αA-crystallin can form a reversible hetero-oligomeric complex with Hsp27 and αB-crystallin, but not with other proteins unrelated to the sHsp family. In addition, we have identified the N-terminal region of αA-crystallin and Hsp27 to be essential for subunit exchange and oligomerization. Based on the results of our studies, we further propose an exchange mechanism that may explain the oligomeric organization of αA-crystallin subunits.DISCUSSIONIn this study we have developed a method to monitor the formation of hetero-oligomeric complexes between αA-crystallin and other structurally compatible proteins. Our method is based on the observed decrease in FRET between AIAS-labeled and LYI-labeled αA-crystallin upon the integration of a foreign protein into the oligomer. We found that the subunits of Hsp27 and αB-crystallin readily exchanged with αA-crystallin (Figs. 3 and 8), suggesting that their quaternary structures are compatible. In contrast, proteins that are not members of the sHsp family, such as β-crystallin, γ-crystallin, and rhodanese, were unable to integrate into the αA-crystallin oligomeric complex. β-Crystallin and γ-crystallin are composed of predominantly β-pleated sheets (8.Jaffe N.S. Horwitz J. Lens and Cataract. Gower Medical Publishing, 1991Google Scholar). While γ-crystallin is a monomer, β-crystallin can exist in multimeric forms (8.Jaffe N.S. Horwitz J. Lens and Cataract. Gower Medical Publishing, 1991Google Scholar). The absence of interaction between αA-crystallin and these proteins indicates that subunit exchange is not a property of any multimeric β-pleated sheet proteins.Our study indicated that the formation of a hetero-oligomeric complex between various forms of sHsp is not only feasible, but is probably quite common. What then is the importance of this type of hetero-oligomeric complex in vivo? α-Crystallin is composed of a 3:1 ratio of αA-crystallin to αB-crystallin in human lens. It has been shown that this complex has greater thermal stability than either protein alone (72.Sun T.X. Liang J.J.N. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 286-290Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar). Thus, one potentially important function of hetero-oligomers is the enhanced effectiveness in protecting cells from damage and stress. This is of paramount importance in the lens, where the lens proteins are constantly subjected to UV light, oxidative stress, and other external insults. Interestingly, Hsp27 is also expressed in the lens (15.Klemenz R. Andres A.C. Frohli E. Schafer R. Aoyama A. J. Cell Biol. 1993; 120: 639-645Crossref PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar). It would be interesting to find out whether or not it also forms a complex with α-crystallins and further contributes to the overall stability of these lens proteins.Hetero-oligomers containing αB-crystallin and Hsp27 have also been shown to be present in non-oncogenic adenovirus-transformed rat kidney cells and in human pectoral muscle (73.Zantema A. de Jong E. Lardenoije R. van der Eb A.J. J. Virol. 1989; 63: 3368-3375Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 74.Kato K. Shinohara H. Goto S. Inaguma Y. Morishita R. Asano T. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 7718-7725Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). However, contrary to the increased thermal stability observed in α-crystallin, the hetero-oligomer of αB-crystallin and Hsp27 was disrupted when cells were treated at 44 °C for 12 min (75.Zantema A. Verlaan-De Vries M. Maasdam D. Bol S. van der Eb A. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 12936-12941Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). We found that heat treatment at 44 °C did not dissociate the preformed complex of recombinant αA-crystallin and Hsp27 (data not shown), suggesting other cellular mechanisms such as phosphorylation or interaction with other proteins may modulate the dissociation of the Hsp27-αB-crystallin complex when the cell is under stress conditions.A hallmark of α-crystallin and other sHsp is their tendency to form large oligomeric structures. The organization of αA-crystallin subunits into larger oligomers most likely involves both ionic and hydrophobic interactions, since we have observed a decrease in the exchange rate under either very low salt or very high salt conditions (67.Bova M.P. Ding L.L. Horwitz J. Fung B.K.-K. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 29511-29517Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (267) Google Scholar). Our truncation study further suggests that sequence 20–56 is essential for the formation of large oligomers (Figs. 4 and 5). This finding is in agreement with Merck et al. (76.Merck K.B. De Haard-Hoekman W.A. Oude Essink B.B. Bloemendal H. De Jong W.W. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1992; 1130: 267-276Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar), who have observed that the removal of the N-terminal region resulted in a reduction in size of the αA-crystallin complex from an average molecular mass of 800 to 60 kDa. Moreover, Caenorhabditis elegans Hsp12.2 and Hsp12.3 that contain only an α-crystallin domain with a very short N-terminal region and no C-terminal tail exist as discrete tetramers (77.Kokke B.P.A. Leroux M.R. Candido E.P.M. Boelens W.C. de Jong W.W. Febs Lett. 1998; 433: 228-232Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). Similarly, yeast Hsp12.6, which is related to Hsp12.2 and Hsp12.3, is monomeric (78.Leroux M.R. Ma B.J. Batelier G. Melki R. Candido E.P.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 12847-12853Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). Taken together, these findings support the hypothesis that the N-terminal region is important for oligomerization.Our findings and those of others have suggested that the overall quaternary structure of the oligomer is variable and dynamic (67.Bova M.P.

Chem. 1998; 273: 286-290Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar) and is shaped by a continuous exchange of subunits (67.Bova M.P. Ding L.L. Horwitz J. Fung B.K.-K. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 29511-29517Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (267) Google Scholar, 81.Sun T.X. Liang J.J.N. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 286-290Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar). The absence of subunit exchange between the small αA-crystallin-(56–173) multimers further implies that the fundamental exchange unit is likely to be a small multimer composed of three or four subunits; otherwise, the αA-crystallin-(56–173) subunits, which apparently can interact to form multimers, should be able to exchange with each other and with the αA-crystallin oligomers. This finding is consistent with the observed conversion of αA-crystallin into tetramers in sodium deoxycholate (82.Kantorow M. Horwitz J. van Boekel M.A. de Jong W.W. Piatigorsky J. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 17215-17220Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar) and the reversible dissociation of Hsp27 to a smaller multimeric form following phosphorylation (64.Kato K.

Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 14867-14874Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar).How do subunits of αA-crystallin assemble into a stable exchange unit? Most sHsp contain a stretch of relatively homologous sequence of approximately 100 residues termed the “α-crystallin domain.” This region has been postulated to mediate subunit-subunit interaction (83.Berengian A.R. Bova M.P. Mchaourab H.S. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 9951-9957Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). Recently, the structure of a 16.5-kDa sHsp from Methanococcus jannaschii has been determined at 2.9-Å resolution (84.Kim K.K. Kim R. Kim S-H Nature. 1998; 394: 595-599Crossref PubMed Scopus (783) Google Scholar). The oligomer was shown to be composed of 24 subunits, with each subunit in the complex making extensive contacts with other subunits through hydrogen bonds, hydrophobic contacts, and ionic interactions. Most of the contact sites are located within the α-crystallin domain, which consists primarily of anti-parallel β-strands. Similarly, a β-sheet structure consisting of three anti-parallel β-strands has also been identified in the same region of αA-crystallin and Hsp27 by site-directed spin-labeling (85.Koteiche H.A. Berengian A.R. Mchaourab H.S. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 12681-12688Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar, 86.Mchaourab H.S. Berengian A.R. Koteiche H.A. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 14627-14634Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). Moreover, residues 109–120 of αA-crystallin and 133–144 of Hsp27 have been shown to form contacts between equivalent strands from neighboring subunits (83.Berengian A.R. Bova M.P. Mchaourab H.S. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 9951-9957Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar, 86.Mchaourab H.S. Berengian A.R. Koteiche H.A. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 14627-14634Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). Taken together, these recent findings suggest that some of the residues within the α-crystallin domain participate in subunit-subunit interaction. Perhaps these contact sites are also involved in stabilizing the quaternary structure of the small multimers.Our findings further suggest that the exchange unit of αA-crystallin are capable of freely associating and dissociating to form large oligomeric complexes. There are two potential mechanisms for the observed exchange reaction. The first mechanism involves the interchanging of the exchange unit as a result of collision between oligomers. The second mechanism is based on the continuous dissociation and reassociation of the exchange unit. Our data indicated that the transfer rate constant is independent of αA-crystallin concentration (Figs. 1 and 2), implying that the exchange of subunits is not due to the collision of the oligomers, but is most likely by a dissociation mechanism. If this mechanism is correct and the dissociation of the exchange unit is rate-limiting, as implied by the high activation energy of 60 kcal/mol (67.Bova M.P. Ding L.L. Horwitz J. Fung B.K.-K. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 29511-29517Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (267) Google Scholar), then the apparent dissociation rate constant (k off) can be determined by measuring the recovery of AIAS emission intensity after diluting the preformed fluorescent αA-crystallin mixture with a large pool of unlabeled αA-crystallin (Fig. 1). We have obtained ak off value of 6.3 × 10−4s−1 under this condition. Interestingly, the dissociation rate constants of many biological processes, such as receptor binding (87.Jansson M. Uhlen M. Nilsson B. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 4108-4117Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar), subunit assembly and dissociation (88.Persson E. Ezban M. Shymko R.M. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 12775-12781Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar), protein-protein interaction (89.Kuhlmann J. Macara L. Wittinghofer A. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 12027-12035Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar), and antibody-antigen recognition (90.England P. Bregegere F. Bedouelle H. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 164-172Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar), are all in the same range.We have also shown that the Hsp27 subunit can freely integrate into the αA-crystallin oligomeric complex (Fig. 8). Our truncation study further suggests that the N-terminal one-third of the Hsp27 molecule also contains the structure essential for subunit exchange activity (Figs. 6 and 9). Sequence comparison between αA-crystallin, Hsp27, and other members of the sHsp family indicates residues 18–28 and 40–46 of αA-crystallin are highly conserved. It is tempting to speculate that these residues may form an integral part of a common structural surface that allows unrestricted interfacing between various forms of sHsp. Site-directed mutagenesis of these residues in these regions would be an excellent way to test this hypothesis.αA-crystallin has been shown to possess chaperone-like property that binds unfolded proteins and prevents their aggregation during denaturation (29.Horwitz J.

We hypothesize that the area of interaction with denatured protein is this hydrophobic crevice located near the N-terminal interface between. The access to this pocket may involve a transient exposure through rearrangement of the exchange unit. α-Crystallin and Hsp271 are members of the small heat shock protein (sHsp) family (1.Ingolia T.D.

We examined this hypothesis by identifying and characterizing two murine cDNAs that encoded PanK. The two cDNAs were predicted to arise from alternate splicing of the same gene to yield different mRNAs that encode two isoforms (mPanK1α and mPanK1β) with distinct amino termini. The predicted protein sequence of mPanK1 was not related to bacterial PanK but exhibited significant similarity to Aspergillus nidulansPanK. mPanK1α was most highly expressed in heart and kidney, whereas mPanK1β mRNA was detected primarily in liver and kidney. Pantothenate was the most abundant pathway component (42.8%) in normal cells providing clear evidence that pantothenate phosphorylation was a rate-controlling step in CoA biosynthesis. Enhanced mPanK1β expression eliminated the intracellular pantothenate pool and triggered a 13-fold increase in intracellular CoA content. mPanK1β activityin vitro was stimulated by CoA and strongly inhibited by acetyl-CoA illustrating that differential modulation of mPanK1β activity by pathway end products also contributed to the management of CoA levels.

E. coli is capable ofde novo pantothenate biosynthesis, and additionally a sodium-dependent permease actively transports exogenous pantothenate into the cell (7.Vallari D.S. Rock C.O. J.

Rock C.O. J. Bacteriol. 1987; 169: 5795-5800Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The PanK gene of E. coli (coaA) was cloned by functional complementation of this mutant and was identical to a previously sequenced allele called rts (12.Song W.-J. Jackowski S. J.

E. coliPanK (bPanK) is a homodimer of 36-kDa subunits that exhibit highly positive cooperative ATP binding and mediate sequential ordered catalysis with ATP as the leading substrate (15.Song W.-J. Jackowski S. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 27051-27058Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). CoA and its thioesters inhibit bPanK activity by competitive binding to the ATP site (15.Song W.-J.

Nonesterified CoA is the most potent inhibitor of bPanKin vitro and in vivo, whereas acetyl-CoA is about 20% as effective as CoA (16.Vallari D.S. Jackowski S. Rock C.O. J. Biol.

PanK is also proposed to be the master regulator of CoA biosynthesis in mammalian cells (for review see Ref. 17.Robishaw J.D. Neely J.R. Am. J.

Since CoA and its thioesters are important regulators of several key enzymes in intermediary metabolism, such as pyruvate dehydrogenase, adjustments in the level of CoA and acetyl-CoA that occur in the examples cited above contribute to the metabolic alterations observed during fasting, in diabetes, and following treatment with hypolipidemic drugs.

In contrast to bacteria, acetyl-CoA is significantly more effective than CoA at inhibiting mammalian PanK in cell extracts and partially purified preparations. A recent detailed study with a purified eukaryotic PanK from A. nidulans (aPanK) found that acetyl-CoA was a potent aPanK inhibitor, whereas CoA was ineffective (38.Calder R.B. Williams R.S.B. Ramaswamy G. Rock C.O. Campbell E. Unkles S.E. Kinghorn J.R. Jackowski S. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 2014-2020Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). The bacterial PanK and aPanK do not exhibit a significant degree of similarity in their protein sequences reflecting the sharp contrast in the specificity of feedback regulation between the two proteins. The goal of the present study was to identify and characterize a mammalian PanK and test whether the expression level of this enzyme influences the regulation of intracellular CoA content, and to determine if CoA or acetyl-CoA is the most important feedback regulator of mammalian PanK activity. Sources of supplies were as follows: American Radiolabeled Chemicals, d-[1-14C]pantothenate (specific activity, 53.5 mCi/mmol); Bio-Rad, Bradford dye-binding protein assay solution; Promega, Klenow fragment; Analtech Inc., 250-μm Silica Gel H thin layer chromatography plates; Qiagen, Qiaquick kit; NEN Life Science Products, [α-32P]dCTP (specific activity, 3000 Ci/mmol); Fisher, Scintisafe 30%; Life Technologies, Inc., LipofectAMINETM reagent; Promega, restriction endonucleases and T4 DNA ligase; Qiagen, P100 columns; Sigma, CoA, acetyl-CoA, and malonyl-CoA; and Whatman, DE81 filter circles. All other materials were reagent grade or better. The A. nidulansPanK sequence was used to search the EST data base for related clones. This yielded clone AA030321 expressed in fetal tissue that contains the common region of mPanK1. mPanK1α- (AA014914 expressed in mouse placenta) and mPanK1β-specific (AI181055 expressed in mouse liver andAA105778 expressed in mouse kidney) EST clones were subsequently identified using AA030321. 3′-Rapid amplification of cDNA ends was performed to determine the 3′-untranslated region of the mPanK1 cDNA using reagents supplied by Life Techologies, Inc. Poly(A)+ RNAs (0.2 μg) from mouse brain, heart, kidney, liver, or skeletal muscle tissues (CLONTECH) were used as template for the first-strand cDNA synthesis together with an oligo(dT)-containing adapter primer 5′-GGCCACGCGTCGACTAGTACTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTT-3′ and Superscript TMII reverse transcriptase. The first-strand cDNA was used as a template for the PCR using the mPanK1-specific primer 5′-GATCTAGTGATCTTTTGGATCAAGG-3′ and the abridged universal amplification primer 5′-GGCCACGCGTCGACTAGTAC-3′. PCR products of the same size were amplified from all five tissues. The products were subcloned into the TA vector pCR2.1 (Invitrogen) and sequenced on both strands using M13 forward and reverse primers. The cDNA sequences of the 3′-untranslated regions were identical in all of the clones. The mPanK1β expression vector (pmPanK1β) was constructed by digesting EST clone AA105778 with BstXI. This product was first blunted by digestion with mung bean nuclease and the product was then digested with NheI. This fragment containing the entire mPanK1β open reading frame was cloned into plasmid pcDNA3.1 that had been digested with EcoRV and NheI. The clone was verified by DNA sequencing. The mPanK cDNA sequences were determined on both strands by automated DNA sequencing using ABI 373A automated fluorescent sequencing equipment at the Molecular Resource Center of St. Jude Children's Research Hospital. Enzyme preparation and assays were performed as described previously (16.Vallari D.S. Jackowski S. Rock C.O. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 2468-2471Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The pantothenate kinase-specific activities in cell lysates were calculated as a function of protein concentration. Assays were linear with respect to both time and protein input. Protein concentrations were measured by the method of Bradford (39.Bradford M.M. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 72: 248-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (217544) Google Scholar) with bovine γ-globulin as a standard. Standard assays containedd-[1-14C]pantothenate (45.5 μm; specific activity 55 mCi/mmol), ATP (2.5 mm, pH 7.0), MgCl2 (2.5 mm), Tris-HCl (0.1 m, pH 7.5), and 15 μg of protein from a soluble cell extract (see below) in a total volume of 40 μl. The mixture was incubated for 10 min at 37 °C, and the reaction was stopped by depositing a 30-μl aliquot onto a Whatman DE81 ion-exchange filter disc that was washed in three changes of 1% acetic acid in 95% ethanol (25 ml/disc) to remove unreacted pantothenate. 4′-Phosphopantothenate was quantitated by counting the dried disc in 3 ml of scintillation solution. COS-7 cells were grown in 100-mm dishes to 80% confluency in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum and 1% glutamine. Transfections using LipofectAMINETM reagent were performed according to the manufacturer's instructions. Briefly, 10 μg of plasmid and 60 μl of LipofectAMINETM reagent were diluted separately into 0.8 ml of serum-free medium. The two solutions were combined and incubated at room temperature for 45 min. Next, 6.4 ml of serum-free medium was added to each tube, and the diluted solution was overlaid onto cells that had been previously rinsed with serum-free medium. The cells and reagents were incubated at 37 °C for 5 h and then 8 ml of growth medium containing twice the normal amount of serum was added. The medium was replaced 24 h after the start of the transfection procedure. At 24 h post-transfection, cells were labeled at 37 °C for 24 h with d-[1-14C]pantothenate (2 μm, specific activity 55 mCi/mmol) in pantothenate-free Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium and dialyzed serum. Cells were washed with phosphate-buffered saline, harvested by scraping and centrifugation, and stored as pellets at −20 °C. Pantothenate metabolites were separated on Silica Gel H thin layers developed withn-butyl alcohol/acetic acid/water (5:2:3 v/v) and quantitated by zonal scraping of the plates followed by scintillation counting of the silica gel fractions. The identities of individual metabolites were confirmed by co-migration with standards in both the acidic chromatography system described above and a basic solvent system (ethanol/28% ammonium hydroxide, 4:1, v/v) as described previously (10.Jackowski S. Rock C.O. J. Bacteriol. 1981; 148: 926-932Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Panothenate kinase activity was measured in COS-7 cells that had been incubated for 48 h at 37 °C following transfection with plasmid pmPanK1β or pcDNA3.1 vector. Transfected cell pellets were resuspended in 100 μl of hypotonic lysis buffer (10 mmTris-Cl pH 7.5, 1 mm EDTA, 5 μg/ml leupeptin, 10 mm NaF) and left on ice for 30 min. Cells were then sonicated in a cup horn at maximum power three times for 30 s. Unbroken cells and cell debris were pelleted by centrifugation for 5 min at 5,000 × g. PanK activity was measured in aliquots of the cell extracts as described above. A mouse multiple tissue Northern blot was purchased from CLONTECH and hybridized and washed according to the manufacturer's instructions. The blot was first hybridized with an 808-bp 32P-labeled probe prepared from the digestion of cDNA clone AA030321 with AatII andNdeI which lies within the region common to both splice variants and which would signal the mRNAs encoding both mPanK1 isoforms. The mPanK1α-specific 171-bp probe was prepared by PCR amplification using the mPanK1α cDNA clone W83049 as a template and the 5′-GAACGGGCTGCTGCACAAC-3′ plus 5′-GTTCTTCCTCCCGGAGTCC-3′ primer pair. The 187-bp mPanK1β-specific probe was prepared by PCR amplification using the mPanK1β cDNA clone AI181055 as the template and the 5′-GGTAGACTGTAAAGGGTACC-3′ plus 5′-GCTTTCTGCCATTTACAAGC-3′ primer pair. RT-PCR was performed using mouse brain, heart, kidney, liver, or skeletal muscle poly(A)+ RNAs that were purchased fromCLONTECH. The RNAs (200 ng) were used as template to synthesize the first strand cDNA using Superscript TMII reverse transcriptase (Life Technologies, Inc.) following the manufacturer's recommended procedure and using the gene-specific primer 5′-CGTAGGCAGTGTTAGAAGTTAAATAC-3′ that was common to both mPanK1α and mPanK1β cDNAs. PCR amplification was carried out using 4 μl of the individual first-strand cDNAs as template together with a nested primer specific for the common region 5′-GCCGTGATATCCTTCGGTTC-3′ (R289) plus either the mPanK1α-specific primer 5′-GAACGGGCTGCTGCACAAC-3′ (F35) or the mPanK1β-specific primer 5′-GGTAGACTGTAAAGGGTACC-3′ (A16). PCR reactions were performed in 20 μl with 35 thermocycles at 94 °C for 30 s for denaturation, 55 °C for 1 min for annealing, and 72 °C for 2 min extension. PCR products (8 μl) were separated by gel electrophoresis in 1.4% agarose. BLAST searches of the public expressed sequence tagged (EST) data base identified cDNA clones (GenBankTM accession numbers AA030321 andAA014914 for mPanK1α; AI181055 and AA105778 for mPanK1β) with sequences homologous to the A. nidulans PanK (38.Calder R.B. Williams R.S.B. Ramaswamy G. Rock C.O. Campbell E. Unkles S.E. Kinghorn J.R. Jackowski S. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 2014-2020Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar) (Fig.1). The clones were purchased, and the complete cDNA sequences were determined on both strands for each clone. Analysis of the sequence data revealed that the mRNAs were the products of the same gene, and the cDNAs were predicted to encode two protein isoforms, designated mPanK1α and mPanK1β. The open reading frame encoding mPanK1β was preceded by an in-frame stop codon upstream from the first methionine. An in-frame stop codon in the 5′-sequence of the mPanK1α cDNA was not found, leaving open the possibility that the entire open reading frame had not been identified. Thus efforts were focused on characterization of the mPanK1β cDNA. The mPanK1β cDNA was predicted to encode a protein of 373 amino acids. The predicted molecular size of mPanK1β was 41,642 Da with a predicted isoelectric point of 6.03. The predicted amino acid sequence of mPanK1α included a methionine that aligned with the assigned translational start site of the mPanK1β cDNA (Fig. 1). The amino terminus of the α isoform differed from the β isoform from residues 2 to 10. Both isoforms were identical in amino acid sequence and in length from residues 11 to 373. The results of 3′-rapid amplification of cDNA ends on five different murine tissue poly(A)+RNAs confirmed the presence of the polyadenylation signal (AATAAA) in the 3′-untranslated region followed by the poly(A)+ tail 22 bp downstream. These data confirmed the assignment of the stop codon after residue 373. The relative abundance of mPanK1 mRNA expression in a variety of adult mouse tissues was addressed by Northern blot analysis (Fig. 2). Each lane contained 2 μg of poly(A)+ RNA isolated from the tissues indicated, and the blot was probed first with radiolabeled cDNA representing the coding sequence common to both mPanK1β and mPanK1α. A 3.6-kb mRNA was detected at high levels in heart, liver, and kidney tissues, with lower levels in brain and skeletal muscle. A 3.1-kb mRNA was also detected at high levels in liver and kidney and to a lesser extent in testis. A larger RNA of approximately 5 kb was also signaled in liver. Radiolabeled probes specific for either the mPanK1α or the mPanK1β coding sequences were then hybridized sequentially to kidney poly(A)+ mRNA because this tissue expressed both mPanK1 mRNAs. These experiments revealed that the 3.6-kb mRNA corresponded to mPanK1α expression, whereas the smaller 3.1-kb mRNA corresponded to mPanK1β expression (Fig. 2). To verify the results obtained with the Northern blotting, RT-PCR was performed using poly(A)+ RNA isolated from various mouse tissues as template for the RT reaction. Isoform-specific primers corresponding to the 5′-ends of either the α or β cDNAs were paired with a primer corresponding to the mPanK1 common sequence in the PCR step. The mPanK1β message was confirmed to be in abundance in kidney and liver, whereas brain, heart, and skeletal muscle were found to express mPanK1β at a lower, but detectable, level (Fig.3). The mPanK1α message was confirmed to be at high levels in heart, kidney, and liver, less in brain, and then at low but detectable levels in skeletal muscle (Fig. 3). These results were consistent with the conclusions derived from the Northern blot, where mPanK1α and mPanK1β mRNAs were abundant and present at about the same steady-state levels in kidney; mPanK1β expression was greater than mPanK1α in liver, and heart expressed primarily mPanK1α. The enhanced sensitivity of RT-PCR enabled detection of relatively low expression of the two isoforms in skeletal muscle and in brain, where the expression of mPanK1α was slightly greater than that of mPanK1β (Figs. 2 and 3).Figure 3RT-PCR analysis of mPanK1α and mPanK1β expression in mouse tissues. A, tissue distribution of mPanK1α evaluated using the F35 and R289 primer pair. B, tissue distribution of mPanK1β determined using the A16 and R289 primer pair. Primer R289 was a reverse primer from the common region of both mPanK1 cDNAs, whereas primer F35 was specific for the mPanK1α transcript, and A16 was specific for the mPanK1β transcript. C, control RT-PCR experiments: lane 1, primer F35 + template; lane 2, primer R289 + template; lane 3, primer A16 + template; lane 4, A16 + R289 without template.

Pantothenate kinase enzymatic activity was significantly higher in the lysate from pmPanK1β-transfected cells (Fig.4). Endogenous pantothenate kinase was detected in the control lysates at protein concentrations of 50 μg and higher (data not shown) with an average specific activity of 3.24 ± 0.07 pmol/min/mg. In the experiment shown in Fig. 4, pantothenate kinase enzyme was overexpressed an estimated 250 times in the cells transfected with pmPanK1β, indicating that a functional protein was encoded by the plasmid. Repeated transfections with the plasmid construct gave similar results. Two sets of COS-7 cells were transfected with either the mPanK1β expression plasmid or the control vector. Cells within a set were pooled and re-plated into pantothenate-free Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium plus dialyzed serum 24 h after transfection to avoid variation in transfection efficiency among replicate dishes.d-[1-14C]Pantothenate (2 μm) was added, and cells were radiolabeled for another 24 h at 37 °C and then harvested. Overexpression of mPanK1β was 919.9 ± 13.2 pmol/min/mg as determined by biochemical assay of an aliquot of the pooled cells from each set. The relative amounts of cellular pantothenate and its metabolites were compared in control cells and in cells overexpressing mPanK1β (Fig. 5). Pantothenate, which is the substrate for pantothenate kinase, constituted 43% of the total radiolabeled metabolite pool in control cells, whereas the product of the kinase, phosphopantothenate, was not detectable (Fig. 5 A). These data indicated that the phosphorylation of pantothenate by the endogenous level of PanK was rate-limiting to the CoA biosynthetic pathway and was consistent with previous results obtained in bacteria (1.Jackowski S. Neidhardt F.C. Curtiss R. Gross C.A. Ingraham J.L. Lin E.C.C. Low K.B. Magasanik B. Reznikoff W. Riley M. Schaechter M. Umbarger H.E. Escherichia coli and Salmonella typhimurium: Cellular and Molecular Biology. American Society for Microbiology, Washington, D. C.1996: 687-694Google Scholar) and mammals (18.Robishaw J.D. Berkich D.A. Neely J.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1982; 257: 10967-10972Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 19.Robishaw J.D. Neely J.R. Am. J. Physiol. 1984; 246: H532-H541Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The data also demonstrated that the transport of pantothenate into the cell was not limiting, but rather cellular pantothenate accumulated prior to its phosphorylation by PanK. Neither 4′-phosphopantothenate nor 4′-phosphopantothenoylcysteine was detected, but phosphopantetheine was the second most abundant metabolite and constituted 35% of the total (Fig. 5 A). These data suggested that the phosphopantetheine adenylyltransferase also catalyzed a slow step in the CoA biosynthetic pathway. The adenylyltransferase is three steps removed from PanK and converts 4′-phosphopantetheine into dephospho-CoA by addition of an adenine moiety. CoA was the third metabolite that was present in significant amounts, and it represented 22% of the total radiolabeled material (Fig. 5 A), the smallest of the three major pools in the control cells. In contrast, cells overexpressing mPanK1β did not accumulate pantothenate but readily metabolized it (Fig. 5 B and Fig.6). The total uptake ofd-[1-14C]pantothenate also increased by about 4-fold in response to overexpression of mPanK1β (Fig. 6). The cellular radiolabeled pool was dominated by two metabolites, CoA (75%) and 4′-phosphopantetheine (25%). The CoA level was 13 times higher in cells with the PanK construct and, unlike in control cells, exceeded the level of 4′-phosphopantetheine. These data demonstrated that the expression level of PanK1β influenced both the uptake and metabolism of pantothenate and, most importantly, regulated the cellular CoA content. The data also indicated that whereas the phosphopantetheine adenylyltransferase may be a slow step in the pathway of CoA biosynthesis, possible regulation at this step was secondary to regulation by the PanK enzyme. PanK activity from different sources is inhibited by CoA and/or CoA thioesters (15.Song W.-J. Jackowski S. J. Biol.

https://openalex.org/W1977363803,"The potato tuber (Solanum tuberosumL.) ADP-glucose pyrophosphorylase (ADP-GlcPPase) catalyzes the first committed step in starch biosynthesis. The main type of regulation of this enzyme is allosteric, and its activity is controlled by the ratio of activator, 3-phosphoglycerate to inhibitor, Pi. It was reported (Fu, Y., Ballicora, M. A., Leykam, J. F., and Preiss, J. (1998) J. Biol. Chem. 273, 25045–25052) that the enzyme was activated by reduction of the Cys12disulfide linkage present in the catalytic subunits. In this study, both reduced thioredoxin f and m from spinach (Spinacia oleracea) leaves reduced and activated the enzyme at low concentrations (10 μm) of activator (3-phosphoglycerate). Fifty percent activation was at 4.5 and 8.7 μm for reduced thioredoxin f andm, respectively, and 2 orders of magnitude lower than for dithiothreitol. The activation was reversed by oxidized thioredoxin. Cys12 is conserved in the ADP-GlcPPases from plant leaves and other tissues except for the monocot endosperm enzymes. We postulate that in photosynthetic tissues, reduction could play a role in the fine regulation of the ADP-GlcPPase mediated by the ferredoxin-thioredoxin system. This is the first time that a covalent mechanism of regulation is postulated in the synthesis of starch. The potato tuber (Solanum tuberosumL.) ADP-glucose pyrophosphorylase (ADP-GlcPPase) catalyzes the first committed step in starch biosynthesis. The main type of regulation of this enzyme is allosteric, and its activity is controlled by the ratio of activator, 3-phosphoglycerate to inhibitor, Pi. It was reported (Fu, Y., Ballicora, M. A., Leykam, J. F., and Preiss, J. (1998) J. Biol. Chem. 273, 25045–25052) that the enzyme was activated by reduction of the Cys12disulfide linkage present in the catalytic subunits. In this study, both reduced thioredoxin f and m from spinach (Spinacia oleracea) leaves reduced and activated the enzyme at low concentrations (10 μm) of activator (3-phosphoglycerate). Fifty percent activation was at 4.5 and 8.7 μm for reduced thioredoxin f andm, respectively, and 2 orders of magnitude lower than for dithiothreitol. The activation was reversed by oxidized thioredoxin. Cys12 is conserved in the ADP-GlcPPases from plant leaves and other tissues except for the monocot endosperm enzymes. We postulate that in photosynthetic tissues, reduction could play a role in the fine regulation of the ADP-GlcPPase mediated by the ferredoxin-thioredoxin system. This is the first time that a covalent mechanism of regulation is postulated in the synthesis of starch.

In vitro, since the reaction is reversible, the enzyme also catalyzes the pyrophosphorolysis of the ADP-Glc to produce ATP and Glc-1-P. The potato (Solanum tuberosum) tuber enzyme, as all the ADP-GlcPPases from higher plants studied so far, is a heterotetramer comprised of two distinct subunits (5.Okita T.W. Nakata P.A. Anderson J.M. Sowokinos J. Morell M. Preiss J. Plant Physiol. (Bethesda). 1990; 93: 785-790Crossref PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar). Both of these genes were cloned and expressed in Escherichia coli to yield a recombinant enzyme comprised of two large (51 kDa) subunits and two small (50 kDa) subunits (L2S2) (3.Preiss J. Foyer C. Quick P. Engineering Improved Carbon and Nitrogen Resource Use Efficiency in Higher Plants. Taylor & Francis Ltd., London1997: 81-104Google Scholar, 6.Ballicora M.A. Laughlin M.J. Fu Y. Okita T.W. Barry G.F. Preiss J. Plant Physiol. (Bethesda). 1995; 109: 245-251Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar). The amino acid sequence of the small subunits of higher plant ADP-GlcPPases is highly conserved, but the similarity among different large subunits is lower (7.Smith-White B.J. Preiss J. J. Mol. Evol. 1992; 34: 449-464Crossref PubMed Scopus (177) Google Scholar). The major function of the large subunit is to modulate the regulatory properties of the small subunit, which is primarily involved in catalysis (6.Ballicora M.A. Laughlin M.J. Fu Y. Okita T.W. Barry G.F. Preiss J. Plant Physiol. (Bethesda). 1995; 109: 245-251Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar, 8.Ballicora M.A. Fu Y. Nesbitt N.M. Preiss J. Plant Physiol.

In every plant tissue studied so far, the major activator of the enzyme is 3-phosphoglycerate (3-PGA) and the major inhibitor is orthophosphate (Pi) (2.Preiss J. Preiss J. The Biochemistry of Plants. 14. Academic Press, San Diego, CA1988: 181-254Crossref Scopus (188) Google Scholar, 10.Preiss J. Annu. Rev. Plant. Physiol. 1982; 33: 431-454Crossref Google Scholar). In photosynthetic organisms, the ratio [3-PGA]/[Pi] regulates allosterically this reaction and therefore the synthesis of starch (10.Preiss J. Annu. Rev. Plant. Physiol. 1982; 33: 431-454Crossref Google Scholar). It was found that the activity of both the recombinant and the ADP-GlcPPase purified from potato tubers is stimulated by dithiothreitol (DTT) (6.Ballicora M.A. Laughlin M.J. Fu Y. Okita T.W. Barry G.F. Preiss J. Plant Physiol. (Bethesda). 1995; 109: 245-251Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar, 11.Sowokinos J.R. Plant Physiol. (Bethesda). 1981; 68: 924-929Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Recently, it was possible to characterize with the recombinant enzyme the mechanism of this stimulation (12.Fu Y. Ballicora M.A. Leykam J.F. Preiss J. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 25045-25052Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar). There are two distinct stages, activation and catalysis (Scheme FSI). The first one is a slow step that involves DTT and the substrates to convert the enzyme from a native (oxidized) to an activated reduced form. DTT is responsible for the reduction of the only disulfide bond present in the oxidized form, which is an intermolecular bridge between Cys12 of the two small subunits. The substrates are needed to attain the active conformation after the reduction. This process was tested in the absence of activators and inhibitors in the catalytic step. The ratio [3-PGA]/[Pi] is, however, still the main factor to regulate the activity of the enzyme. The reductive activation by DTT increased the activity up to 4-fold (12.Fu Y. Ballicora M.A. Leykam J.F. Preiss J. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 25045-25052Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar), whereas 3-PGA activated the enzyme 30-fold (8.Ballicora M.A. Fu Y. Nesbitt N.M. Preiss J. Plant Physiol. (Bethesda). 1998; 118: 265-274Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). The Cys12 is conserved in all small subunits from plant ADP-GlcPPases known so far with the exception of the ones from endosperm tissue. The role of the activation by DTT was not clear since it is not a physiological compound. However, the regulation of many enzymes in plants follows a similar scheme of activation, as depicted in Scheme FSI, where the physiological reductant is thioredoxin. In this study, we tested both thioredoxin m and ffrom spinach (Spinacia oleracea) leaves. We observed that their reduced forms are able to activate the ADP-GlcPPase from potato tuber 4-fold when assayed at low concentrations of 3-PGA. We postulate that thioredoxin could play a role as a fine regulator of the ADP-GlcPPase from potato and from other plant tissues having the conserved Cys on the N-terminal of the small subunit. [32P]PPi was purchased from NEN Life Science Products. [14C]Glucose-1-P was from ICN Pharmaceuticals Inc. (Costa Mesa, CA). All other reagents were purchased at the highest quality available. DTT concentration was determined spectrophotometrically at 412 nm using 5,5′-dithiobis(2-nitrobenzoic acid) (Ellman's reagent) as described previously (13.Habeeb A.F.S.A. Methods Enzymol. 1972; 25: 457-464Crossref PubMed Scopus (863) Google Scholar). The recombinant ADP-GlcPPase from potato tuber was expressed in a strain of E. coli cell, AC70R1-504, devoid of endogenous ADP-GlcPPase activity. The enzyme was purified as indicated previously (6.Ballicora M.A. Laughlin M.J. Fu Y. Okita T.W. Barry G.F. Preiss J. Plant Physiol. (Bethesda). 1995; 109: 245-251Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar). It has been shown that the purified enzyme was in the oxidized form (12.Fu Y. Ballicora M.A. Leykam J.F. Preiss J. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 25045-25052Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar), and unless otherwise indicated, this enzyme form is referred to as the “oxidized” form. Protein concentration of the ADP-GlcPPase was determined by using bicinchoninic acid reagent (14.Smith P.K. Krohn R.I. Hermanson G.T. Mallia A.K. Garter F.H. Provenzano M.D. Fujimoto E.K. Goeke N.M. Olson B.J. Kenk D.K. Anal. Biochem. 1985; 150: 76-85Crossref PubMed Scopus (18346) Google Scholar) (Pierce) with BSA as the standard. The ADP-GlcPPase was reduced as follows: the purified enzyme (14 μg) was incubated in the presence of 50 mm Hepes (pH 8.0), 6 mm MgCl2, 2 mm ADP-Glc, 0.5 mg/ml BSA, and 4 mm DTT at 37 °C in a total volume of 100 μl. After 30 min the enzyme was desalted using with Bio-spin 6TM columns (Bio-Rad) equilibrated with 50 mmHepes (pH 8.0), 6 mm MgCl2, 2 mmADP-Glc and used immediately. It has been shown that in this condition the Cys12 is reduced (12.Fu Y. Ballicora M.A. Leykam J.F. Preiss J. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 25045-25052Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar). Pyrophosphorolysis of ADP-Glc was determined by the formation of [32P]ATP from32PPi. Unless otherwise indicated, the reaction mixture contained 20 μmol of glycine-glycine buffer (pH 8.0), 1.75 μmol of MgCl2, 2.5 μmol of NaF, 0.5 μmol of ADP-Glc, 0.38 μmol of 32PPi (0.5 to 2.0 × 106 cpm/μmol), 50 μg of crystalline bovine serum albumin, and variable concentrations of 3-PGA in a final volume of 0.25 ml. The reaction was started by the addition of the enzyme and, after 2 min incubation at 37 °C, was terminated by the addition of 3 ml of cold 5% trichloroacetic acid. The [32P]ATP formed was measured as described previously (15.Morell M.K. Bloom M. Knowles V. Preiss J. Plant Physiol. (Bethesda). 1987; 85: 182-187Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Synthesis of ADP-Glc was followed by the formation of [14C]ADP-Glc from [14C]Glc-1-P. Unless otherwise indicated, the reaction mixtures contained, in 0.2 ml, 20 μmol of Hepes buffer (pH 8.0), 1.4 μmol of MgCl2, 0.1 μmol of [14C]Glc-1-P (1.0 × 106 cpm/μmol), 0.3 μmol of ATP, 0.3 unit of inorganic pyrophosphatase, and 40 μg of crystalline bovine serum albumin. 3-PGA was added at different concentrations as indicated. Assays were initiated by addition of the enzyme. Reaction mixtures were incubated for 5 min at 37 °C and terminated by heating in a boiling water bath for 1 min. [14C]ADP-Glc was assayed as described previously (16.Ghosh H.P. Preiss J. J. Biol. Chem. 1966; 241: 4491-4504Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). SDS-PAGE was performed as described by Laemmli (17.Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (205516) Google Scholar) on 4–15% Tris-HCl pre-cast gradient polyacrylamide gel (Bio-Rad) except that β-mercaptoethanol was not added to the protein samples. Molecular weight markers were PerfectTM protein markers (Novagen, Madison WI). After the electrophoresis, the gel was electroblotted onto a ProtranTM nitrocellulose membrane (Schleicher & Schuell). This nitrocellulose membrane was treated with affinity purified anti-spinach leaf ADP-GlcPPase antibody (primary antibody), and the antigen-antibody complex was detected via treatment with alkaline phosphatase-linked goat anti-rabbit IgG. Color detection of the alkaline phosphatase was performed as described previously (18.Iglesias A.A. Kakefuda G. Preiss J. Plant Physiol. (Bethesda). 1991; 97: 1187-1195Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). Molecular weight markers were visualized including S-protein alkaline phosphatase conjugate (Novagen, Madison, WI) on the incubation with the secondary antibody. Recombinant thioredoxins f and m were purified as described in the literature (19.Schürmann P. Methods Enzymol. 1995; 252: 274-283Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar) and kept frozen at −80 °C in small aliquots. The concentration was determined spectrophotometrically using an extinction coefficient at 278 nm of 16,830 and 20,500 m−1 cm−1 for thioredoxins f and m, respectively (19.Schürmann P. Methods Enzymol. 1995; 252: 274-283Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). Purified thioredoxins were incubated 5 min at 37 °C in the presence of 50 mm Hepes (pH 8.0), 0.1 mm EDTA, and 5 mm of either reduced or oxidized DTT. 50 μl of this reaction was desalted with Bio-spin 6TM columns (Bio-Rad) equilibrated in 50 mm Hepes (pH 8.0) and used immediately. An aliquot of the eluate was separated and diluted in a 50-μl quartz cuvette to measure the concentration of thioredoxin as mentioned above. This procedure efficiently removed the DTT from the samples. A control with reduced DTT but no thioredoxin showed no detectable amounts of DTT after the desalting step (<4 μm) using 5,5′-dithiobis(2-nitrobenzoic acid) as described above. Kinetic data were plotted as velocity versussubstrate or effector concentration. Kinetic constants were obtained by nonlinear least square fitting of the data with the Hill equation using the program OriginTM 5.0 (Microcal Software Inc., Northampton, MA). Kinetic constants were expressed asA 0.5, S 0.5,I 0.5, which correspond to the concentration of effector necessary to reach 50% of maximal activation, velocity, and inhibition, respectively. The Hill coefficient was represented asn. The ADP-GlcPPase from potato tuber was sensitive to reduction by both of the reduced thioredoxins tested. It has been shown that the small subunit of the potato tuber ADP-GlcPPase migrates as a dimer in non-reducing SDS-PAGE when the intersubunit disulfide bridge Cys12-Cys12 is present (oxidized form) and as monomer when it is cleaved (reduced form) (12.Fu Y. Ballicora M.A. Leykam J.F. Preiss J. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 25045-25052Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar). The large subunit, which has no disulfide bridge, runs in both conditions as a monomer (12.Fu Y. Ballicora M.A. Leykam J.F. Preiss J. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 25045-25052Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar). Therefore, a change of the redox state of the heterotetrameric enzyme can be detected clearly from a modification of the electrophoretic mobility of the small subunit. The antibody (anti-spinach leaf ADP-GlcPPase) used in this work to develop the immunoblot after the electrophoresis is more reactive against the small subunit than the large subunit from potato tuber ADP-GlcPPase. When the enzyme was incubated for 15 min in the presence of ADP-Glc, Mg2+, and either thioredoxin f or m, changes in the electrophoretic mobility were observed (Fig.1). The lower band, which corresponds to the monomers, was much stronger after the incubation, whereas the upper band that constitutes the dimer of the small subunit almost disappeared. When the enzyme was incubated with oxidized thioredoxin, no significant difference was observed with respect to the control. This indicates that the reduced form of both thioredoxins were responsible for the change of mobility of the ADP-GlcPPase, which is attributable to the reduction of the enzyme. Concurrently, these changes in the redox state of the ADP-GlcPPase correlated with the activity in the pyrophosphorolysis direction. When the enzyme was reduced by either thioredoxin, the activity increased more than 2-fold when assayed in absence of the allosteric activator 3-PGA (Fig. 1). Since the reduced thioredoxins f andm can activate the enzyme in the pyrophosphorolysis direction, it was of interest to test the properties of the reduced and oxidized forms of the ADP-GlcPPase in the ADP-Glc synthesis direction, which is the physiological reaction. Once the enzyme was reduced in presence of thioredoxin f, the activity was assayed at different concentrations of 3-PGA and compared with the enzyme treated in absence of thioredoxin (control). It was observed that the thioredoxin-reduced ADP-GlcPPase has a higher affinity for the activator (Fig. 2). TheA 0.5 was 40 μm for the reduced and 85 μm for the control enzyme. Since the curve of the control enzyme was slightly more sigmoidal (n = 1.5) than the curve of the activated enzyme (n = 0.8), the activity at lower concentrations of activator was markedly higher for the thioredoxin-reduced ADP-GlcPPase. When the concentration of 3-PGA was 10 μm in the assay mixture, the activity of the thioredoxin-reduced enzyme was more than 4-fold higher than the control. However, both of the forms of the ADP-GlcPPase, reduced and oxidized, did not show big differences in the parameters of other effectors: the main inhibitor (Pi), substrate (Glc-1-P) and the cofactor (Mg2+) (TableI). Only the substrate ATP showed a significant but rather small difference since the apparent affinity of the reduced form was 1.6-fold higher (Table I). TheS 0.5 values were 56 and 90 μm for the reduced and oxidized forms, respectively. In presence of Pi, there is a shift on both 3-PGA activation curves, but the effect of the thioredoxin is maintained. At 0.2–0.3 mm3-PGA the difference in activity between the reduced and the oxidized form is ∼4-fold.Table IKinetic parameters of the reduced and oxidized ADP-GlcPPase from potato tuberEffectorADP-GlcPPase formOxidizedReduced by thioredoxin fI0.5 (n), μmPi120 ± 20 (0.9)140 ± 25 (0.9)S0.5 (n), μmATP90 ± 9 (1.1)56 ± 3 (1.2)Glc-1-P32 ± 2 (1.7)34 ± 2 (1.2)Mg2+1830 ± 60 (4.5)1640 ± 80 (7.0)The ADP-GlcPPase was used in its oxidized form as described under “Materials and Methods” or was first reduced in 50 mmHepes (pH 8.0), 6 mm MgCl2, 2 mmADP-Glc, and 12 μm reduced thioredoxin f at 37 °C for 30 min. Aliquots were withdrawn, and the activity was determined in the synthesis direction. Concentration of the effector was varied, whereas the concentration of the others was kept constant. The concentration of the activator 3-PGA was 10 μm in all cases.

The concentration of the activator 3-PGA was 10 μm in all cases. The kinetic parameters were determined as described under “Materials and Methods.” The deviation is the difference between duplicate experiments. The time curve of the reductive activation was studied assaying the enzyme in the synthesis direction in presence of 10 μm 3-PGA. This concentration of activator maximizes the difference between both redox forms of the ADP-GlcPPase (Fig. 2). The enzyme incubated in the presence of 12 μm thioredoxin f increased the activity up to 4-fold reaching near-maximum after 30 min. The calculatedt 0.5 of activation was 14 min. On the other hand, the control incubation did not modify the activity of the enzyme even after 60 min (Fig. 3), which further demonstrates that the presence of reduced thioredoxin is needed for the activation. Both reduced thioredoxinsf and m were capable of activating the ADP-GlcPPase from potato tuber. However, it has been observed that other reducing agents (monothiols and dithiols including DTT) have similar effects on the enzyme. 2M. A. Ballicora, J. B. Frueauf, Y. Fu, P. Schürmann, and J. Preiss, unpublished results. To test if the thioredoxins transfer the reducing power more efficiently, the reaction was performed at different concentrations. It was observed that both thioredoxins were needed in concentrations 2 orders of magnitude lower than DTT, which is the most powerful reducing agent tested on this enzyme. Thioredoxin f was twice as effective asm. The A 0.5 values were about 4.6, 8.7, and 400 μm for thioredoxin f, m, and DTT, respectively (Fig. 4). The reversibility of the process was examined incubating the activated (reduced) ADP-GlcPPase in the presence of oxidized thioredoxin. It was observed that oxidized thioredoxin f inactivates the enzyme. After 30 min of incubation, the activity was only 42% when compared with the control that was in absence of thioredoxin (TableII). This inactivation was completely reversible because after the addition of DTT the activity increased 4.2-fold (Table II), which is the ratio that is expected between the oxidized and reduced form (Figs. 3 and 4). It was observed that after adding DTT the activity increased 1.7-fold in the control (Table II) indicating that the enzyme was not completely reduced. Most likely, the control was partially oxidized by O2 during the 30-min incubation.Table IIInactivation of the reduced ADP-GlcPPase by oxidized thioredoxinIncubationActivityμmol · min −1 · mg −1A, Control5.6 ± 0.2B, thioredoxin f (oxidized)2.4 ± 0.1C, A, then + DTT + 15 min9.4 ± 0.2D, B, then + DTT + 15 min10.1 ± 0.4The potato tuber ADP-GlcPPase (2.8 μg), previously reduced as indicated under “Materials and Methods,” was incubated in presence of 20 mm Hepes (pH 8.0), 6 mm MgCl2, 2 mm ADP-Glc, and 12 μm oxidized thioredoxinf at 37 °C.

Open table in a new tab The potato tuber ADP-GlcPPase (2.8 μg), previously reduced as indicated under “Materials and Methods,” was incubated in presence of 20 mm Hepes (pH 8.0), 6 mm MgCl2, 2 mm ADP-Glc, and 12 μm oxidized thioredoxinf at 37 °C.

The deviation is the difference between the duplicates. It had been previously shown in our laboratory that the potato tuber ADP-GlcPPase could be activated by DTT and that the activation mechanism involved the slow reduction of the Cys12-Cys12 intersubunit disulfide bridge (12.Fu Y. Ballicora M.A. Leykam J.F. Preiss J. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 25045-25052Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar). In this work, we show that the enzyme is also activated by chloroplast thioredoxins f and m from spinach leaves and that either of the two reduced plastidial thioredoxins can replace DTT in the cleavage (Fig. 1) of the disulfide bridge. The kinetic properties of the thioredoxin-reduced enzyme differ from those of the oxidized form, as shown by a change in the affinity toward the activator 3-PGA (Fig. 2). Measurement of behavior toward other effectors did not detect any other important differences between the oxidized and reduced forms when assayed in the presence of 10 μm 3-PGA (Table I). This indicates that the affinity for the substrates does not play a role on the reductive activation of the enzyme at low concentrations of activator. Moreover, the affinity for the substrates does not vary whether the enzyme is activated by 3-PGA, reduction, or both. When the enzyme was assayed at saturated concentrations of 3-PGA (2 mm) the K m values for ATP and Glc-1-P were not significantly different between the reduced and oxidized forms and were similar to the values shown in Table I (data not shown). ADP-Glc was included in the activation mixture since it had been shown previously, when DTT was used as activator, that there was a further, conformational, conversion after the chemical, reductive, step if the substrate site is fully occupied (12.Fu Y. Ballicora M.A. Leykam J.F. Preiss J. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 25045-25052Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar). Filling of substrates sites can be achieved using ATP, Glc-1-P, and Mg2+/Ca2+or ADP-Glc. Thioredoxin f proved to be to be more efficient than thioredoxin m in the activation process, but the difference was only 2-fold. Although other enzymes regulated by thioredoxin seem to be far more selective toward one or another of the two forms,f or m (20.Wolosiuk R.A. Ballicora M.A. Hagelin K. FASEB J. 1993; 7: 622-637Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar), in some cases it has been shown that the inclusion of enzyme effectors diminished the selectivity significantly (21.Mora-Garcia S. Ballicora M.A. Wolosiuk R.A. FEBS Lett. 1996; 380: 123-126Crossref PubMed Scopus (5) Google Scholar). The A 0.5 for the activation of the potato tuber ADP-GlcPPase by spinach leaf thioredoxinf was 4.6 μm, higher than theA 0.5 for the most potent interactions between thioredoxin and its specific enzyme targets like fructose-1,6-bisphosphatase and thioredoxin f (0.9 μm) (22.Mora-Garcia S. Rodriguez-Suarez R. Wolosiuk R.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 16273-16280Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar), but also much lower than nonspecific interactions between fructose-1,6-bisphosphatase and E. colithioredoxin (33 μm). Recently, it was shown that the main factor in the specificity of thioredoxins m, f,and bacterial thioredoxins is manifested by electrostatic interactions (22.Mora-Garcia S. Rodriguez-Suarez R. Wolosiuk R.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 16273-16280Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). When the interactions are shielded or abolished by mutagenesis, the A 0.5 tends to reach values of ∼10 μm in all cases. It is possible that the formsm and f interact in a similar fashion with the potato tuber ADP-GlcPPase because the surface of the enzyme is neutral in the region of contact, but the three-dimensional structure of the enzyme would be needed to confirm this assumption. We do not discard the possibility that other factors (pH, the presence of 3-PGA, Pi, etc.) can modify the conformation of the enzyme exposing charged amino acids and making the interaction more selective, but this hypothesis has not been tested. It has been shown that the homology of the first 20 amino acids at the N terminus of the small subunits of the plant ADP-GlcPPases studied is very high, and the amino acids conserved include the Cys12responsible for the reductive regulation of the potato tuber enzyme. The exceptions to the rule include the monocot endosperm ADP-GlcPPases (23.Ballicora M.A. Fu Y. Frueauf J.B. Preiss J. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1999; 257: 782-786Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). An interesting case is barley (Hordeum vulgaris) where there is a mechanism of splicing that produces two ADP-GlcPPases corresponding to different tissues. The two enzymes share the same sequence except for the first 17 amino acids at the N terminus (24.Thorbjornsen T. Villand P. Kleczkowski L.A. Olsen O. Biochem. J. 1996; 313: 149-154Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar); the leaf enzyme has a Cys on the N terminus of the small subunit but the endosperm enzyme does not. Regarding the physiological relevance of the regulation by thioredoxin, it is worth noting that the same small subunit gene of the potato ADP-Glc PPase is expressed both in tuber and leaf (25.Nakata P.A. Anderson J.M. Okita T.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 30798-30807Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), although the level of expression is higher in tuber. Both enzymes are located in plastids; the leaf form is in the chloroplast, and the tuber enzyme is in the amyloplast (26.Kim T.W. Franceschi V.R. Okita T.W. Robinson N.L. Morell M. Preiss J. Plant Physiol. (Bethesda). 1989; 91: 217-220Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The most important physiological difference between these two subcellular environments is that the chloroplast is autotrophic whereas the amyloplast is heterotrophic (27.Sivak N.M. Preiss J. Adv. Food Nutr. Res. 1998; 41: 1-199Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In chloroplasts, the physiological interpretation of the regulation by thioredoxin in vitro is straightforward; the ferredoxin-thioredoxin system, which consists of ferredoxin, ferredoxin-thioredoxin reductase, and thioredoxin, is located in the chloroplast, and it has been thoroughly characterized (20.Wolosiuk R.A. Ballicora M.A. Hagelin K. FASEB J. 1993; 7: 622-637Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). Upon illumination, photosynthetic electron transport reduces ferredoxin, which then reduces thioredoxin via the ferredoxin-thioredoxin reductase. Reduced thioredoxin regulates many enzymes by this light-mediated mechanism, and at night, the effect of thioredoxin, oxidized by O2, is the opposite. The results presented in this paper suggest that thioredoxin could reduce or oxidize the chloroplastic ADP-GlcPPase during the light/dark cycle, thus providing a fine- tuned regulation of starch synthesis on chloroplasts. This mechanism could be particularly important at low concentrations of 3-PGA, where the difference of activity between the reduced and oxidized forms is maximal. The [3-PGA]/[Pi] ratio would be the main factor in the regulation, but in the dark, when the concentration of 3-PGA decreases, the oxidized thioredoxin could lower even more the activity of the ADP-GlcPPase, thus avoiding a futile cycling of starch metabolism. Indeed, oxidative inactivation of the ADP-GlcPPase by oxidized thioredoxin f occurred in vitro (Table II). In absence of Pi it was observed that the optimal concentration of 3-PGA to observe the regulation by thioredoxin is ∼10 μm. When the assay is performed in presence of 2 mm Pi, there is a shift on the 3-PGA activation curves, but the effect of regulation by thioredoxin in the lower part of the curve (0.2–0.6 mm) is conserved (Fig. 2 B). This is closer to the physiological conditions in the plastids. In amyloplasts, it is not clear what concentrations are physiological for these two metabolites. In chloroplasts, the concentration of Pi is difficult to determine experimentally because of the large amounts stored in the vacuoles; however, it is believed that both 3-PGA and Piconcentrations are in the mm range (28.Kaiser W.M. Basham J.A. Plant Physiol. (Bethesda). 1979; 63: 105-108Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The light/dark change produces shifts of 1 pH unit in the chloroplast (20.Wolosiuk R.A. Ballicora M.A. Hagelin K. FASEB J. 1993; 7: 622-637Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). Although the data reported here were obtained at pH 8.0, we observed that the reductive regulation by thioredoxin f also occurs at pH 7.0 and 7.5 (data not shown). The potato ADP-GlcPPases from tuber and leaf are heterotetrameric, and although the small subunit is the same in both enzymes (25.Nakata P.A. Anderson J.M. Okita T.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 30798-30807Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), the large subunits are different. It is the small subunit that contains the site subject to reductive regulation, but the modulation exerted in the leaf enzyme on the small subunit by the different large subunit might give to the leaf form different kinetic constants than those reported here for the tuber enzyme. It would be interesting to test the effect of the plastidial thioredoxins (m and f) on the enzyme from potato leaf. Earlier experiments by Kaiser and Basham (28.Kaiser W.M. Basham J.A. Plant Physiol. (Bethesda). 1979; 63: 105-108Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) suggested that the ADP-GlcPPase in an extract of lysed spinach leaf chloroplasts could be activated by reduction. High levels of DTT (10–50 mm) increased the synthesis of ADP-Glc in these extracts 5.7-fold (28.Kaiser W.M. Basham J.A. Plant Physiol. (Bethesda). 1979; 63: 105-108Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), but the interpretation of those experiments was not clear because conditions for the activation of the purified enzyme were not reported (10.Preiss J. Annu. Rev. Plant. Physiol. 1982; 33: 431-454Crossref Google Scholar). The relevance of the regulation by thioredoxin is not clear for an enzyme that is located in the amyloplast like the ADP-GlcPPase from potato tuber. Moreover, thus far it has not been investigated whether there is any thioredoxin in amyloplast or any other heterotrophic plastid. This is because biochemical studies on amyloplasts have been very few when compared with studies on chloroplasts, mainly because amyloplasts are very difficult to isolate intact. Despite the lack of experimental evidence, it is likely that a thioredoxin form is present in amyloplasts since thioredoxins are widely distributed and have been detected in many plant tissues and in different subcellular locations, including cytosol, mitochondria, chloroplasts, and nuclei (29.Jacquot J.P. Lancelin J.M. Meyer Y. New Phytol. 1997; 136: 543-570Crossref PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar). Indeed, plants display more diversity of thioredoxins than other organisms. For instance, in Arabidopsis thaliana, there are at least eight thioredoxin h genes, and four thioredoxin m and two thioredoxin f forms have been isolated (29.Jacquot J.P. Lancelin J.M. Meyer Y. New Phytol. 1997; 136: 543-570Crossref PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar). The other issue is what is the nature of the reducing power that would drive regulation of a target protein (e.g. ADP-GlcPPase) by thioredoxin. In the amyloplast, there is no photosynthetic electron transport, but like in other heterotrophic plastids, the oxidative pentose phosphate pathway generates reducing power. In the first two steps of this pathway, the Glc-6-P is oxidized producing NADPH by glucose-6-P dehydrogenase and 6-phosphogluconate dehydrogenase. In the amyloplast, the main carbon source, translocated from the cytosol, is either Glc-6-P or Glc-1-P (30.Emes M.J. Neuhaus H.E. J. Exp. Bot. 1997; 48: 1995-2005Google Scholar). The NADPH produced in this light-independent process further reduces a ferredoxin form that is present in heterotrophic plastids and serve as reducing power for ferredoxin-dependent enzymes (21.Mora-Garcia S. Ballicora M.A. Wolosiuk R.A. FEBS Lett. 1996; 380: 123-126Crossref PubMed Scopus (5) Google Scholar). It has been described that the cytosolic thioredoxin h is reduced by NADPH via a NADP-thioredoxin reductase as in bacteria (NADP-thioredoxin system). On the other hand, chloroplastic forms (m and f) use ferredoxin as an electron donor as mentioned above (ferredoxin-thioredoxin system). In heterotrophic plastids both electron donors are present, but it is not known whether either a ferredoxin-thioredoxin or NADP-thioredoxin system exists. More information about the biochemistry of the amyloplast is needed before we can draw any definite conclusion about the role of reductive activation in the regulation the ADP-GlcPPase from potato tuberin vivo. We postulate that in chloroplasts, where the reductive regulatory site (Cys12) is conserved, reductive activation by thioredoxin could add fine-tuning to the allosteric effect of 3-PGA. In the amyloplast, demonstration of the presence of a thioredoxin-like molecule is required before further speculation on the physiological relevance of reductive regulation of the ADP-GlcPPase. To our knowledge, this is the first time that a non-allosteric mechanism of regulation is postulated in the synthesis of starch and that conditions in which an ADP-GlcPPase is activated by thioredoxin are reported.

To understand the molecular pathway from histone acetylation to this Sp1 family factors-mediated promoter activation, we investigated the function of p300, one of the histone acetyltransferase, in the present work. The evidence supporting the linkage between p300 and TSA-induced p21 promoter activation were realized from the following findings: 1) cotransfection of p300 elevated p21 promoter activity, and this elevation was dependent on TSA-responsive GC-box; 2) TSA-induced promoter activation was blocked by the introduction of p300 dominant-negative mutant into cells; and 3) Sp1- or Sp3-mediated activation was also suppressed by this p300 dominant-negative mutant. Our data also suggested that p300 collaborates with Sp1 in a way which is different from that when p300 collaborates with p53 in p21 transcription.

Further studies indicated that p21 is also regulated by other transcription factors during cell differentiation and growth arrest (5.Michieli P. Chedid M. Lin D. Pierce J.H. Mercer W.E. Givol D.

During the study of cellular senescence, we found that the inhibitors of histone deacetylase, either sodium butyrate or TSA, can promote p21 transcription and induce growth arrest and senescence-like state in NIH 3T3 cells (9.Xiao H. Hasegawa T. Miyaishi O. Ohkusu K. Isobe K. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1997; 237: 457-460Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar). 2H. Xiao, T. Hasegawa, and K-i. Isobe, unpublished data.The minimal region of the mouse p21 promoter, containing from −60 to +40 bp relative to the TATA box, is essential and sufficient for the induction of p21 promoter by TSA. We reported also that a GC-box in this region is critical for both basal and TSA-induced promoter activity and that Sp1 and Sp3 are the functional activators of this GC-box (10.Xiao H. Hasegawa T. Isobe K. J. Cell. Biochem. 1999; 73: 291-302Crossref PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar). However, one question remained, how does histone acetylation affect Sp1-mediated transcription? Recently, the study of transcriptional regulation has been moving its focus to chromatin level. The molecules involved in chromatin transcription include DNA (promoter, enhancer, or silencer), histones, and non-histone proteins. It has become increasingly apparent that the equilibrium of histone acetylation and deacetylation plays an important role in transcriptional regulation (11.Wade PA. Pruss D. Wolffe A.P. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1997; 22: 128-132Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (410) Google Scholar, 12.Grunstein M. Nature. 1997; 389: 349-352Crossref PubMed Scopus (2401) Google Scholar). Several mammalian histone acetyltransferases and histone deacetylases have been cloned in recent years (13.Wang L. Mizzen C. Ying C. Candau R. Barlev N. Brownell J. Allis C.D. Berger S.L. Mol. Cell.

Chin J. Tsai L.H. Livingston D.M. Dotto G.P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 5451-5455Crossref PubMed Scopus (328) Google Scholar), the cis-element in the p21 promoter and the sequence-specific transcriptional activator remained unknown. The present work is part of our effort to understand the linkage between histone acetylation and Sp1-mediated transcription. Here we show evidence that p300 is required for TSA-induced, Sp1-mediated p21 transcription and discuss the possible mechanism of the functional interaction between Sp1 and p300 in p21 transcriptional activation. HeLa cells from ATCC and COS-1 cells from RIKEN (Wako, Japan) were cultured in a 37 °C humidified atmosphere containing 5% CO2 in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum. Trichostatin A (Wako, Osaka) was dissolved with ethanol at a concentration of 1 mg/ml and stored at −20 °C. The working solution was diluted with distilled phosphate-buffered saline to 10 μg/ml concentration and stored at 4 °C for less than 1 week. The full-length (pGL3b-4542), the wild type minimal region (pGL3b-60 or pRL-60), and the GC-box mutated minimal region (pGL3b-#4 or pRL-#4) of the p21 promoter inserted in two types of luciferase reporter containing vectors have been described elsewhere (10.Xiao H. Hasegawa T. Isobe K. J. Cell. Biochem. 1999; 73: 291-302Crossref PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar). All expression vectors employed in this study were driven by the CMV promoter. Sp1 cDNA expressing constructs (pCGN-Sp1) and its backbone vector pCGN were kind gifts from Thomas Shenk (Princeton University) (27.Parks C.L. Shenk T. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 4417-4430Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (202) Google Scholar). Sp3 cDNA expressing construct (pCGN-Sp3) was generated by subcloning human Sp3 cDNA from pCMV4-Sp3flu into pCGN vector (10.Xiao H. Hasegawa T. Isobe K. J. Cell. Biochem. 1999; 73: 291-302Crossref PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar). p300 cDNA expressing construct(pGAL4p300) and its dominant-negative mutant (pGAL4p300/1514–1922) were provided by Antonio Giordano (Thomas Jefferson University) (28.Dennig J. Beato M. Suske G. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 5659-5667Crossref PubMed Scopus (203) Google Scholar). pCAF cDNA expression vector (pCI-pCAF) was from Yoshihiro Nakatani (National Institutes of Health) (16.Yang X.J. Ogryzko V.V. Nishikawa J. Howard B.H. Nakatani Y. Nature. 1996; 382: 319-324Crossref PubMed Scopus (1317) Google Scholar). The Sp1 expression construct used forin vitro transcription and translation experiments was made by introducing the 2.0-kilobase XbaI/SmaI fragment of pERV2/Sp1 (21.Yuan W. Condorelli G. Caruso M. Felsani A. Giordano A. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 9009-9013Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (277) Google Scholar) into a T7 promoter containing expression vector, pcDNA3.1/Myc.HisC (Invitrogen), at XbaI andEcoRV sites. pRL-TK (Promega), a Renillaluciferase reporter vector, was used for transfection efficiency control. For mammalian two-hybrid experiments, the following constructs were used. 1) pG5luc was a 5-GAL4 DNA binding sites-containing firefly luciferase vector (Promega). 2) pGAL4p300 was the same construct as mentioned above, which is a chimeric fusion of GAL4 DNA binding domain (DBD) and full-length p300 cDNA. 3) pVP16pCAF was created by inserting the EagI/KpnI fragment of pCAF cDNA from pCI-pCAF into pACT vector (Promega), which has a VP16 activation domain (AD) sequence, at NotI and KpnI sites. 4) pVP16Sp1N was made by two steps. The 1.5-kilobase BamHI fragment of Sp1 cDNA from pCGN-Sp1 was inserted into pcDNA3.1/Myc.HisC vector at the BamHI site first, and then the EcoRV and KpnI insert from correctly directed clone was subcloned into pACT vector at the EcoRV and KpnI sites. 5) pVP16Sp1C was made by the same strategy as that for pVP16Sp1N except the 0.5-kilobase BamHI fragment of Sp1 cDNA was used, and 6) pRL-TK as mentioned above. Cells were seeded into 48-well plate at a density of 30,000 cells/well the day before transfection. In the transfection experiments with reporter plasmid only, HeLa cells were transfected with 100 ng of promoter-reporter construct by standard calcium phosphate procedure. Treatments of TSA were started after 24 h and continued for another 24 h generally, except where noted in the figure legends. In cDNA cotransfection experiments, transfection was performed by using FugeneTM6 (Roche Molecular Biochemicals). The DNA mixture contained 20 ng of reporter and 20–100 ng of cDNA and either pCGN or pcDNA3.1 to adjust a total amount of DNA to 120 ng per well. For mammalian two-hybrid assays, COS-1 cells were transfected by standard calcium phosphate procedure with the combination of pG5luc, pGAL4, and pVP16 (or their corresponding fusions) in 1:1:1 molar ratio. pGEM-5Zf(+) vector was also added as carrier and for making the concentration of DNA to 0.3 μg/well. In all of these experiments, after 2 days of transfection, 5 of 50 μl of total cell lysate was used, and its luciferase activity was assayed by luminometer and dual luciferase assay kit (Promega). The luciferase activities were normalized against the activity of pRL-TK control vector (Promega) and protein concentration. Every experiment was performed at least three times. Labeled proteins were produced from pGAL4p300, pCI-pCAF, and pcDNA3.1/Myc.HisCSp1 plasmids by in vitro transcription and translation system (TNT kit, Promega) in the presence of [35S]methionine. Two μl of in vitro translated 35S protein and 2 μg of specific antibody were incubated in 50 μl of binding buffer (25 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.0), 10% glycerol, 75 mmKCl, 5 mm MgCl2, 0.1 mm EDTA, 0.1% Nonidet P-40, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 0.5 mm PMSF) at 4 °C for 1 h and with 10 μl of 3% bovine serum albumin-blocked protein G-Sepharose (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech, 50% slurry) for an additional 1 h. After washing with binding buffer three times, the beads were resuspended in 50 μl of the same buffer and incubated with 2 μl of labeled pCAF or Sp1 reaction mixture at room temperature for 30 min. Then the beads were washed again and boiled for 2 min in the presence of 20 μl of Laemmli buffer. Finally, the supernatants were separated on 8% SDS-polyacrylamide electrophoresis gel. For the immunoprecipitation of unlabeled cellular p300 protein, HeLa cell lysates in radioimmune precipitation buffer (25 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.0), 150 mm NaCl, 1% Nonidet P-40, 0.5% deoxycholate, 0.1% SDS, 2.5 mm EDTA, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 0.5 mm PMSF) were immunoprecipitated with anti-p300 antibody and protein G-Sepharose. The beads were washed by radioimmune precipitation buffer three times and binding buffer once. Thereafter, the beads were used for pull-down assay as described above. The experimental procedure was the same as that described previously (10.Xiao H. Hasegawa T. Isobe K. J. Cell. Biochem. 1999; 73: 291-302Crossref PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar) except that the nuclear extract was from HeLa cells, and only the32P-labeled oligonucleotides probe with the wild type p21 promoter sequence (−40 to −10 bp from TATA box) was used. The polyclonal antibodies directed against Sp1 (catalogue number sc-59), Sp3 (sc-644), p300 N-terminal (p300-N, sc-584), p300 C-terminal (p300-C, sc-585) were purchased from Santa Cruz Biotechnology (Santa Cruz, CA). The monoclonal antibody for p300 (p300-mono, 05–267) was from Upstate Biotechnology (Lake Placid, NY). We have reported that TSA greatly induced the p21 promoter activity and determined the cis-element responsive to TSA in NIH 3T3 cells (10.Xiao H. Hasegawa T. Isobe K. J. Cell. Biochem. 1999; 73: 291-302Crossref PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar). We found that these results are not cellular-specific. In HeLa cells, the morphological differentiation and elevated p21 expression were also noticed after TSA treatment, and the minimal promoter region and TSA-responsive GC-box were the same as those in NIH 3T3 cells (results not shown). To confirm the functional effects of Sp1 family transcription factors on p21 promoter, especially on the TSA response of this promoter, we cotransfected wild type or the TSA-responsive GC-box-mutated promoter-luciferase constructs with Sp1 or Sp3 cDNA expression construct into HeLa cells (Fig.1). While Sp1 and Sp3 can obviously activate wild type minimal promoter (pRL21–60) in a dose-dependent manner, they poorly activate the GC-box mutated minimal promoter (pRL21-#4) and empty vector (pRL-null). These results suggest that both Sp1 and Sp3 are the transactivators of the p21 promoter in HeLa cells, and they function through the TSA-responsive GC-box in vivo. Therefore, TSA, GC-box, and Sp1/Sp3 are tightly interrelated in p21 promoter activity. Because no changes in Sp1/Sp3 protein expression or in their DNA binding activity were found after TSA treatment (data not shown), we considered that TSA-induced p21 promoter activity may result from some kinds of interaction between Sp1/Sp3 and histone acetyltransferase or deacetylase. As the first step to issue this question, we examined the effect of p300 on p21 promoter. As shown in Fig. 2, transfection of wild type p300 expression construct, pGAL4p300, into cells enhanced either full-length (pGL3b-4542) or minimal promoter (pGL3b-60) activity. The experiments performed using the intact wild-type p300 (pCMVβp300 provided from Prof. David M. Livingston) gave results similar to those using the GAL4 derivative (data not shown).This suggested the positive effect of p300 on p21 transcription. Different from p21 wild type minimal promoter, the activity of the GC-box mutated promoter (pGL3b-#4) was not affected by p300 cotransfection. Thus the TSA-responsive GC-box is also required for the function of p300 to the p21 promoter, as it is required for the function of Sp1/Sp3 on p21 promoter. The interrelationship of p300 and TSA-induced promoter activation was further evidenced by cotransfection of a dominant-negative mutant of p300 expression construct (pGAL4p300/1514–1922) with p21 promoter construct, followed by TSA treatment. The product of pGAL4p300/1514–1922 encodes only a small portion of p300 protein, corresponding to the CH3 domain and its surroundings, and has been reported to be capable of interfering with the activity of endogenous protein (28.Dennig J. Beato M. Suske G. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 5659-5667Crossref PubMed Scopus (203) Google Scholar, 30.Avantaggiati M.L. Ogryzko V. Gardner K. Giordano A. Levine A.S. Kell K. Cell. 1997; 89: 1175-1184Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (591) Google Scholar). In our experiment, this mutant lost the up-regulating effect of wild type p300 on the p21 promoter (Fig.3 A). Meanwhile, in the cells expressing this mutant p300, the p21 minimal promoter activity induced by TSA was obviously dose-dependent suppressed (Fig.3 B). These results suggest that the p300 molecule is also involved in TSA-induced p21 promoter activation. Considering the facts that both Sp1/Sp3 and p300 can up-regulate p21 promoter and function through the same GC-box in TSA-induced p21 promoter activation, the cooperative relationship between them might be present. To expose the interrelationship of Sp1/Sp3 and p300, we investigated the requirement of p300 for Sp1/Sp3-mediated transactivation. When Sp1 or Sp3 was cotransfected with various amounts of dominant negative mutant p300, Sp1/Sp3-mediated promoter activation was dose-dependent blocked (Fig.4). This result suggests that p300 is required for Sp1/Sp3-mediated p21 transcription and that some kind of collaboration between p300 and Sp1/Sp3 was present during this process. The cooperation of p300 and Sp1/Sp3 shown in functional assays described above may be from direct or indirect interaction of p300 with Sp1/Sp3. As p300 has been shown to physically interact with various transcription factors, we examined the physical relationship between p300 and Sp1 in vitro and in vivo. Fig.5 showed the results from two kinds ofin vitro protein binding assays. In immunoprecipitation pull-down assay (Fig. 5 A), the positive control, recombinant pCAF protein, can associate with recombinant p300 (lane 4) or native p300 (lane 7), whereas recombinant Sp1 cannot (lanes 5 and 8). That Sp1 does not associate with p300 in vitro was also implied from super shift assay (Fig.5 B). In this experiment, three kinds of antibodies for p300 failed to produce any shift or the loss of Sp1 and Sp3 complexes which were binding to the TSA-responsive GC-box-containing oligonucleotides (lanes 4–6). To examine whether there is the physical interaction between p300 and Sp1 in cellular situation, mammalian two-hybrid assay was performed. Fig.6 A shows the structures of fusion proteins produced in transfected cells and the schematic representation of this two-hybrid system. Briefly, after cotransfecting the GAL4 binding sites-containing reporter construct with GAL4DBD-fused vector as well as VP16AD-fused vector, the luciferase activity induced was detected. As shown in Fig. 6 B, when the GAL4DBD-fused p300 protein expressed together with the VP16AD-fused pCAF protein, which is a known p300 association protein, the luciferase activity in cells increased more than 2-fold. However, when the GAL4DBD-fused p300 expressed with VP16AD-fused Sp1, neither its N-terminal nor C-terminal portion, the luciferase activity was not affected compared with that with VP16AD only. This means that the exogenous p300 and Sp1 did not interact directly in this system. In vivoco-immunoprecipitation was also tried to detect the interaction of endogenous p300 and Sp1, but no positive clue was found (data not shown).Figure 6p300 does not directly interact with Sp1 in mammalian two-hybrid system. A, schematic representation of the two-hybrid system. The full-length p300 was cloned into a GAL4DBD-containing vector; the almost full-length of pCAF or indicated regions of Sp1 were inserted into a VP16AD-containing vector. Both of them were cotransfected with a GAL4 DNA binding sites-containing luciferase reporter vector. B, luciferase activity induced by different combinations of cotransfection. COS-1 cells seeded in a 48-well plate were transfected with the DNA mixture composed of the same molar ratio of pG5luc, GAL4p300, and VP16pCAF, VP16Sp1N, or VP16Sp1C. 30 ng of pRL-TK and a different amount of pGEM-5Zf(+) were used as internal control and carrier DNA, respectively. The total amount of DNA is 0.3 μg/well. Every point was triplicate, and the data are representative of three experiments. +, present; −, absent.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) The original purpose of this work is to elucidate how TSA affected Sp1-mediated p21 transcription. In view of recent progress in transcriptional regulation, we assumed that some kinds of histone acetyltransferase and/or deacetylase may be altered physically or functionally during TSA treatment and thus influence function of Sp1 family transcription factors. In working to try to identify these involved histone acetyltransferase and/or deacetylase, we found that p300, one of the histone acetyltransferases, up-regulates p21 promoter and functions through the GC-box responsible to TSA (Figs. 2 and 3). The dominant negative mutant of p300 can clearly block TSA-induced p21 activation, further supporting the opinion that p300 functionally contributes to TSA-induced p21 activation. It has been reported that p300 works as a coactivator for various transcription activators, such as MyoD, p53, RAR, CREB, c-Jun, and for basal transcription factors, for example TBP (21.Yuan W. Condorelli G. Caruso M. Felsani A. Giordano A. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 9009-9013Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (277) Google Scholar, 22.Somasundaram K. El-Deiry W.S.

A. 1996; 93: 8884-8888Crossref PubMed Scopus (368) Google Scholar). There is no report up to now implying the interaction of p300 and Sp1 family transcription factors. The same GC-box dependence of Sp1/Sp3 and p300 in p21 promoter activation reported in our present work, thereby, raises the possibility that p300 may cooperate with Sp1 family transcription factors as well. To address this question, the dominant negative mutant of p300 was cotransfected with Sp1 or Sp3 based on the idea that if the cooperative relationship is present, cellular knockout of p300 will abolish the function of Sp1/Sp3. Our results support this idea (Figs. 3 and 4). Owen, et al. (31.Owen G.I. Ricker J.K. Tung L. Takimoto G. Horowitz K.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 10696-10701Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (317) Google Scholar) reported recently that progesterone regulates transcription of p21 gene through Sp1 and CBP/p300. They showed data indicating that progesterone regulates p21 promoter activity through a Sp1 site and E1A can abolish the effect of progesterone on p21 promoter containing this Sp1 site. Given that other proteins except CBP/p300 also associate with E1A (32.Sandmoller A. Meents H. Arnold H.H. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 5846-5856Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar, 33.Mazzarelli J.M. Mengus G. Davidson I. Ricciardi R.P. J.

FEBS Lett. 1998; 429: 183-188Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar), we think the result from cotransfecting with E1A may not be enough for supporting the involvement of p300 in this Sp1 site-mediated transcription. By comparing the different effect of p300 on wild type or GC-box-mutated promoter and utilizing its dominant negative mutant to suppress TSA- and Sp1/Sp3-induced transactivation, we provide direct evidence here that p300 can regulate the activity of the p21 promoter through Sp1-mediated transcription. p300 is also involved in p21 transcription through a p53-mediated way (22.Somasundaram K. El-Deiry W.S. Oncogene. 1997; 14: 1047-1057Crossref PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar, 30.Avantaggiati M.L. Ogryzko V. Gardner K. Giordano A. Levine A.S. Kell K. Cell. 1997; 89: 1175-1184Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (591) Google Scholar). In that case, p300 physically interacts with p53 and is recruited by p53 to the basal transcription machinery. However, the molecular basis of the collaboration of p300 and Sp1 in p21 promoter regulation seems different. As the results from in vitro andin vivo experiments failed to provide any evidence that p300 directly interact with Sp1 (Figs. 5, 6), we considered that p300 and Sp1 might indirectly interact through a common multi-protein complex which is important for p21 transcription. Given that either p300 or Sp1 can interact with TBP and other basal transcription factors (35.Dallas P.B. Yaciuk P. Moran E. J. Virol. 1997; 71: 1726-1731Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 36.Abraham S.E. Lobo S. Yaciuk P. Wang H.G. Moran E. Oncogene. 1993; 8: 1639-1647PubMed Google Scholar, 37.Emili A. Greenblatt J. Ingles C.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 1582-1593Crossref PubMed Scopus (226) Google Scholar), and that the Sp1 binding site in p21 promoter is so close to TATA box, this multi-protein complex might be the transcription initiation complex. Thus, we propose one hypothesis here, that the functional collaboration of p300 and Sp1 in p21 expression may rely on the effect of p300 on the activity of the initiation complex or the interaction of this complex with Sp1, which is the base for Sp1-mediated transcription in p21 activation. In fact, a multi-protein transcriptional complex containing TATA-binding protein, Sp1, and cAMP-response element-binding protein (CBP/p300) has been noticed recently (29.Shetty S. Takahashi T. Matsui H. Ayengar R. Raghow R. Biochem. J. 1999; 339: 751-758Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). We prefer to say, based on the results presented here, that p300 is an indispensable factor for the p21 promoter activation, not only in a p53-mediated, DNA damage-responsible way but also in Sp1-mediated, basal and histone acetylation-effected way. Further work remains to be done to identify more details about the cooperation of p300 and Sp1. We thank Prof. Jonathan M. Horowitz (University of North Carolina), Prof. Thomas Shenk (Princeton University), Prof. Antonio Giordano (Thomas Jefferson University), Prof. David M.

Expression of CD36 in monocyte/macrophages is dependent on differentiation status and exposure to soluble mediators. In this study, we investigated the effect of transforming growth factor-β1 (TGF-β1) and TGF-β2 on the expression of CD36 in macrophages. Treatment of phorbol ester-differentiated THP-1 macrophages with TGF-β1 or TGF-β2 significantly decreased expression of CD36 mRNA and surface protein. TGF-β1/TGF-β2 also inhibited CD36 mRNA expression induced by oxidized low density lipoprotein and 15-deoxyΔ12,14 prostaglandin J2, a peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor (PPAR)-γ ligand, suggesting that the TGF-β1/TGF-β2 down-regulated CD36 expression by inactivating PPAR-γ-mediated signaling. TGF-β1/TGF-β2 increased phosphorylation of both mitogen-activated protein (MAP) kinase and PPAR-γ, whereas MAP kinase inhibitors reversed suppression of CD36 and inhibited PPAR-γ phosphorylation induced by TGF-β1/TGF-β2. Finally, MAP kinase inhibitors alone increased expression of CD36 mRNA and surface protein but had no effect on PPAR-γ protein levels.

In addition, two other macrophage receptors, MARCO (macrophage receptor with a collagenous structure) and CD68 (macrosialin), may also contribute to the uptake of modified lipoproteins (6.Elomaa O.

Unlike the low density lipoprotein receptor, scavenger receptors are not subject to negative regulation by high levels of intracellular cholesterol. We have shown that OxLDL can stimulate its own uptake by induction of CD36 gene expression (21.Han J. Hajjar D.P. Febbraio M. Nicholson A.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 21654-21659Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (234) Google Scholar). The mechanism(s) by which OxLDL up-regulates CD36 involves activation of the transcription factor, peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor (PPAR)-γ (22.Tontonoz P. Nagy L. Alvarez J. Thomazy V.

PPAR-γ is a member of a nuclear hormone superfamily that can heterodimerize with the retinoid X receptor and act as a transcriptional regulator of genes encoding proteins involved in adipogenesis and lipid metabolism (24.Tontonoz P. Hu E. Spiegelman B. Curr. Opin. 2t. Dev. 1995; 5: 571-576Crossref PubMed Scopus (404) Google Scholar). Phorbol esters (phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate (PMA) in particular), macrophage-colony-stimulating factor and interleukin-4 have also been shown to increase monocyte/macrophage expression of CD36 (25.Yesner L. Huh H. Pearce S.F.A. Silverstein R. Arterioscler. Thromb. 1996; 16: 1019-1025Crossref Scopus (151) Google Scholar), whereas expression of CD36 is down-regulated in response to cholesterol efflux (26.Han J. Hajjar D.P. Tauras J.M. Nicholson A.C. J.

With the exception of OxLDL, which activates PPAR-γ leading to CD36 gene transcription, the mechanism(s) by which this diverse collection of factors modulates CD36 expression remains undefined. Transforming growth factor-β1 (TGF-β1) and TGF-β2 are multifunctional mediators that regulate cellular growth, migration, adhesion, extracellular matrix formation, and apoptosis (28.Sporn M. Roberts A. Wakefield L. Crombrugghe B. J. Cell Biol. 1987; 105: 1039-1045Crossref PubMed Scopus (1010) Google Scholar). Smads, a novel family of signaling proteins, are the primary downstream signaling mediators activated following TGF-β receptor ligation (29.Engel M.E. Datta P.K. Moses H.L. J. Cell. Biochem. 1998; 30–31: 111-122Crossref Google Scholar). Heteromeric Smad complexes translocate into the nucleus and act as transcription factors for TGF-β-responsive genes (30.Massague J. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1998; 67: 753-791Crossref PubMed Scopus (3985) Google Scholar). However, in addition to Smad proteins, MAP kinases have also been implicated in mediating downstream TGF-β signaling (31.Chin B.Y. Petrache I. Choi A.M.K. Choi M.E. J. Biol.

We demonstrate that TGF-β1 and TGF-β2 decrease expression of CD36 by a mechanism involving phosphorylation of MAP kinase, subsequent MAP kinase phosphorylation of PPAR-γ, and a decrease in CD36 gene transcription by phosphorylated PPAR-γ. THP-1 cells, a human monocytic cell line, were obtained from ATCC (Manassas, VA). They were cultured in RPMI 1640 medium containing 10% fetal calf serum, 50 μg/ml each of penicillin and streptomycin, and 2 mm glutamine. Cells were adjusted to a density of 2.5 × 105cells/cm2 in 100-mm dishes and treated with 200 nm PMA to induce the differentiation of THP-1 monocytes into macrophages. After 8 h of treatment, PMA was removed and cells were washed twice with phosphate-buffered saline (PBS). Incubation was continued overnight in complete medium before initiation of experiments. TGF-β1 and TGF-β2 were purchased from R & D Systems (Minneapolis, MN). PMA and 15d-PGJ2 were obtained from Calbiochem (San Diego, CA). Cells were lysed in RNAzolTM B (Tel-Test, Inc., Friendswood, TX), chloroform was extracted, and total cellular RNA was precipitated in isopropanol. After washing with 80 and 100% ethanol, the dried pellet of total RNA was dissolved in distilled water and quantified by UV spectroscopy. Poly(A+) RNA was purified from approximately 100 μg of total RNA using the Poly(A)Ttract® mRNA isolation system III (Promega, Madison, WI). Poly(A+) RNA was loaded on 1% formaldehyde agarose gels. Following electrophoresis RNA was transferred to a Zeta-probe® GT genomic tested blotting membrane (Bio-Rad) in 10× SSC by capillary force overnight. The blot was UV cross-linked for 2 min and then prehybridized with HybrisolTM (Oncor, Inc., Gaithersburg, MD) for 30 min before the addition of 32P-randomly primed probes for CD36 or GAPDH. After overnight hybridization, membranes were washed twice for 20 min each time with 2× SSC and 0.2% SDS, and twice for 20 min each time with 0.2× SSC and 0.2% SDS at 55 °C. The blot was autoradiographed by exposure to a x-ray film (X-OmatTMAR, Eastman Kodak Co.). Semiquantitative analysis of autoradiograms was assessed by densitometric scanning using a UMAX (Santa Clara, CA) UC630 flatbed scanner attached to a Macintosh IIci (Apple Computer, Inc., Cupertino, CA) running National Institutes of Health Image software (Bethesda, MD). The probe for CD36 was generated by reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction. The sequences of 5′- and 3′-oligonucleotides used were ATGGGCTGTGACCGGAACT (285–304) and ACAGACCAACTGTGGTAG (871–889), respectively. After treatment, cells were suspended by the addition of trypsin and washed three times with PBS. Approximately 2 × 106 cell were suspended in 300 μl of PBS containing 5% mouse serum and incubated for 30 min at room temperature while shaking. Cells then were incubated with 10 μl of mouse anti-human CD36 conjugated to fluorescine isothiocyanate isomer 1 (Chemicon International Inc., CA). After incubation for 2 h with antibody at room temperature, cells were washed three times with PBS. After suspension in PBS, the cells analyzed by flow cytometry assay with a Coulter FACScan. In addition, photographs were taken of adherent cells on glass slides using a Nikon Labphot2 fluorescent microscope. Macrophages were washed twice with cold PBS and then scraped and lysed in ice-cold lysis buffer (50 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, 1% Triton X-100, 1% sodium deoxychlorate, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 50 mm sodium fluoride, 1 mm sodium orthovanadate, 50 μg/ml aprotinin, and 50 μg/ml leupeptin). The lysate was microcentrifuged for 15 min at 4 °C, and the supernatant was transferred to a new test tube. After determination of protein content by method of Lowry, samples were loaded on an SDS-polyacrylamide electrophoresis gel and transferred onto nylon-enhanced nitrocellulose membrane after electrophoresis. The membrane was blocked with a solution of 0.1% Tween 20/PBS (PBS-T) containing 5% fat-free milk for 2 h. It was next incubated with rabbit polyclonal anti-phospho-p44/42 MAP kinase (New England Bio-Labs) or PPAR-γ (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Santa Cruz, CA) for 2 h at room temperature, followed by washing three times for 10 min each with PBS-T buffer. The blot was reblocked with PBS-T containing 5% milk followed by incubation with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated goat anti-rabbit IgG for another 1 h at room temperature. After washing three times for 10 min each with PBS-T, the membrane was incubated for 1 min in a mixture of equal volumes of Western blot chemiluminescence reagents 1 and 2. The membrane was then exposed to film before development. PMA-differentiated THP-1 macrophages in 60-mm dishes were incubated with [32P]H3PO4 (0.2 mCi/ml). Following treatment, cells were washed three times with PBS and then lysed in 200 μl of lysis buffer. Supernatants were collected after centrifugation. Protein lysates (50 μg) from each sample were incubated with rabbit polyclonal anti-human PPAR-γ (1:150) for 1 h at 4 °C. Protein A-agarose (10 μl) was added, and incubation was continued overnight at 4 °C. After washing three times with cold PBS, the slurry was added to loading buffer and boiled for 5 min before loading on a 12% SDS-polyacrylamide electrophoresis gel. After electrophoresis, the gel was dried and exposed to film. To induce monocyte to macrophage differentiation, THP-1 cells were treated with PMA (200 nm). After several hours of treatment, more than 95% cells became adherent, exhibited spreading, and could not be removed by washing. PMA was removed by washing with PBS, and the cells were incubated overnight in complete medium. To investigate the effect of TGF-β1 and TGF-β2 on expression of CD36 mRNA, PMA-differentiated THP-1 cells were treated with various concentration of TGF-β1 or TGF-β2 for 15 h. TGF-β1 significantly decreased CD36 mRNA expression at a broad range of concentration in a non-dose-dependent manner (0.5–10.0 ng/ml) with maximum inhibition at 1.0 ng/ml (Fig. 1). In contrast, TGF-β2 decreased CD36 mRNA expression only at concentrations ≥2 ng/ml and in a concentration-dependent manner. A time course (Fig. 2) showed that both TGF-β1 and TGF-β2 (3 ng/ml) decreased CD36 mRNA expression by 5 h, although the rate of decrease was slightly faster with TGF-β2.Figure 2Time course of CD36 mRNA expression in response to TGF -β1 and TGF -β2. PMA-differentiated THP-1 macrophages were treated with TGF-β or TGF-β2 (4 ng/ml) in complete medium for the indicated times. Expression of CD36 mRNA was analyzed as described in Fig. 1.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) To determine whether the decrease in CD36 mRNA in response to TGF-β1 and TGF-β2 was associated with decreased cell surface expression of CD36 protein, we evaluated the CD36 surface expression by fluorescence-activated cell sorting (FACS) and immunohistochemistry using anti-CD36-fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated antibody. CD36 surface expression in THP-1 cells was minimal prior to PMA differentiation (Fig.3, THP) but increased significantly following PMA treatment (Fig. 3, THP/PMA). Consistent with the decrease of CD36 mRNA expression in the Northern assay, treatment of PMA-differentiated THP-1 cells with either TGF-β1 (Fig. 3, THP/PMA + TGFβ1) or TGF-β2 (Fig. 3,THP/PMA + TGFβ2) markedly reduced CD36 surface expression. To evaluate the mechanism(s) by which TGF-β1 and TGF-β2 decreased CD36 expression, PMA-differentiated THP-1 cells were treated with OxLDL or 15d-PGJ2 in the absence and presence of TGF-β1 or TGF-β2. Both OxLDL and 15d-PGJ2 activate PPAR-γ and increase transcription of PPAR-γ-responsive genes (22.Tontonoz P. Nagy L. Alvarez J. Thomazy V. Evans R. Cell. 1998; 93: 241-252Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1613) Google Scholar, 23.Nagy L. Tontonoz P. Alvarez J. Chen H. Evans R. Cell. 1998; 93: 229-240Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1594) Google Scholar). As expected, both OxLDL and 15d-PGJ2 increased CD36 mRNA expression (Fig.4). This induction was significantly suppressed by both TGF-β1 and TGF-β2 (Fig. 4), suggesting that TGF-β1 and TGF-β2 abrogated PPAR-γ-mediated transcriptional activation of CD36. Inhibition of induction of CD36 mRNA expression in response to PPAR-γ activation implied that TGF-β1 and TGF-β2 might be blocking PPAR-γ transcriptional activity. Because PPAR-γ contains consensus MAP kinase phosphorylation sequences (35.Adams M. Reginato M.J. Shao D. Lazar M.A. Chatterjee V.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 5128-5132Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (502) Google Scholar) and because MAP kinase-mediated phosphorylation of PPAR-γ had been shown to inhibit PPAR-γ transcriptional activity (35.Adams M. Reginato M.J. Shao D. Lazar M.A. Chatterjee V.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 5128-5132Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (502) Google Scholar), we evaluated the effect of TGF-β1 or TGF-β2 on MAP kinase activity and phosphorylation. When macrophages were treated with TGF-β1 or TGF-β2, both the p44 and p42 isoforms of MAP kinase were rapidly and transiently phosphorylated, with maximum (>2-fold) induction of phosphorylation observed a few minutes after the addition of TGF-β1 or TGF-β2 (Fig. 5). We next evaluated the phosphorylation status of PPAR-γ in response to TGF-β1 and TGF-β2. PMA-differentiated THP-1 macrophages were treated with TGF-β1 and TGF-β2 (4 ng/ml) for 10 h prior to analysis for both PPAR-γ and phospho-PPAR-γ. Western blot analysis demonstrated that phospho-PPAR-γ was undetectable in control macrophages, but treatment with TGF-β1 or TGF-β2 induced expression of phospho-PPAR-γ (Fig.6 A). In addition, PMA-differentiated THP-1 macrophages were incubated with [32P]H3PO4 followed by treatment with TGF-β1, TGF-β2 (4 ng/ml), or the MAP kinase inhibitors PD98059 (10 μm) and UO126 (5 μm) for 10 h. Phosphorylated PPAR-γ was increased 1.6-fold in TGF-β1-treated cells and 1.9-fold in TGF-β2-treated cells relative to untreated cells (Fig. 6 B). In contrast, two MAP kinase inhibitors, PD98059 and UO126, significantly blocked PPAR-γ phosphorylation (Fig.6 B). TGF-β1, TGF-β2 and MAP kinase inhibitors had no effect on PPAR-γ protein levels (Fig. 6, A andC). TGF-β and MAP kinase inhibitors produced opposite effects on PPAR-γ phosphorylation, implying that MAP kinase inhibitors might directly induce expression of CD36 in macrophages. To test this, macrophages were treated with two MAP kinase inhibitors, PD98059 and UO126. Both MAP kinase inhibitors significantly increased CD36 mRNA (Fig.7 A). FACS analysis demonstrated that, consistent with the increase of CD36 mRNA expression by MAP kinase inhibitors, surface protein of CD36 was also increased (Fig. 7 B). Finally, we evaluated the effects of MAP kinase inhibitors on CD36 expression in the presence of TGF-β1 and TGF-β2. Macrophage treatment with TGF-β1 or TGF-β2 markedly decreased expression of CD36 mRNA (Fig. 8). MAP kinase inhibitors increased expression of CD36 mRNA and also abrogated the inhibition of CD36 mRNA in response to TGF-β1 or TGF-β2 (Fig.8). Our data demonstrate that TGF-β1 and TGF-β2 inhibit expression of CD36 by inducing phosphorylation of the p44 and p42 isoforms of MAP kinase, which in turn, results in MAP kinase-mediated phosphorylation of PPAR-γ. Phosphorylation of PPAR-γ results in decreased CD36 gene transcription. MAP kinase inhibitors alone increase expression of CD36 by dephosphorylating and activating PPAR-γ. These data illustrate the complexity of regulation of PPAR-γ-mediated gene expression and demonstrate how multiple signal transduction pathways are utilized to control the transcriptional activities of PPAR-γ and CD36 gene expression. PPARs become transcriptionally active when bound to ligand (24.Tontonoz P. Hu E. Spiegelman B. Curr. Opin. 2t. Dev. 1995; 5: 571-576Crossref PubMed Scopus (404) Google Scholar). The three PPAR isoforms (α, δ, and β/γ) differ in their C-terminal ligand binding domains. PPARs bind to and are activated by such diverse agents as hypolipidemic drugs (fibrates), long chain fatty acids, arachidonic and linoleic acid metabolites (36.Forman B.M. Tontonoz P. Chen J.

Growth factors, such as epidermal growth factor and platelet-derived growth factor, have been shown to phosphorylate PPAR-γ via the MAP kinase signaling pathway and to decrease PPAR-γ transcriptional activity (38.Camp H.S. Tafuri S.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 10811-10816Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (405) Google Scholar). The NH2-terminal domain of PPAR-γ contains a consensus MAP kinase site in a region conserved between PPAR-γ1 and PPAR-γ2 isoforms (35.Adams M. Reginato M.J. Shao D. Lazar M.A. Chatterjee V.K. J.

PPAR-γ proteins migrate on immunoblots as closely spaced doublets, a pattern suggestive of phosphorylation (39.Vidal-Puig A. Jimenez-Linan M. Lowell B.B. Hamann A. Hu E. Spiegelman B. Flier J.S.

Phosphorylation significantly inhibits both ligand-independent and ligand-dependent transcriptional activation by PPAR-γ. (35.Adams M. Reginato M.J. Shao D. Lazar M.A. Chatterjee V.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 5128-5132Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (502) Google Scholar). This repression is mediated by MAP kinase phosphorylation of Ser-82 on PPAR-γ1 (38.Camp H.S. Tafuri S.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 10811-10816Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (405) Google Scholar). Mutation of the phosphorylated residue (Ser-82) prevents PPAR-γ1 phosphorylation as well as growth factor-mediated repression of PPAR-γ-dependent transcription. This phosphorylation-mediated transcriptional repression results from altering the ability of PPAR-γ to become transcriptionally activated by ligand and is not due to a reduced capacity of the PPARγ·retinoid X receptor complex to heterodimerize or recognize its DNA binding site (38.Camp H.S.

Activated MAP kinases have been shown, in turn, to regulate the activity of specific transcription factors including Elk-1, ATF-2, and c-Jun by phosphorylation of serine or threonine residues (44.Treisman R. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1996; 8: 205-215Crossref PubMed Scopus (1163) Google Scholar). The activity of several other nuclear hormone receptors is also regulated by phosphorylation. Phosphorylation of the human 1 thyroid receptor enhances the DNA binding capacity of the protein and increases ligand-mediated transcription (45.Lin K.H. Ashizawa K. Cheng S.Y. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 7737-7741Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). Phosphorylation of the retinoic acid receptor and retinoid X receptor modulates heterodimerization of the receptors and consequently increases DNA binding activity (46.Lefebvre P. Gaub M.-P.

In addition, the MAP kinase-dependent phosphorylation of Ser-118 on the estrogen receptor increases transcriptional activation by the AF1 domain (47.Kato S. Endoh H. Masuhiro Y. Kitamoto T.

Although in general, phosphorylation of nuclear receptors enhances their transcriptional activity, MAP kinase phosphorylation of PPAR-γ negatively regulates its function. Although Smads are the primary downstream signaling mediators activated following TGF-β receptor ligation (29.Engel M.E. Datta P.K. Moses H.L. J. Cell.

Our data implicate MAP kinase-mediated phosphorylation of PPAR-γ in inhibiting expression of CD36 in response to TGF-β and clearly demonstrate that MAP kinase inhibitors up-regulate expression of CD36. However, we cannot completely rule out the possibility that other downstream signaling events initiated by TGF-β activation of MAP kinase can also negatively regulate CD36 expression. In conclusion, we show for the first time that TGF-β, a growth factor expressed within atherosclerotic lesions, induces phosphorylation of PPAR-γ, inhibits its transcriptional activity, and down-regulates expression of the type B scavenger receptor, CD36. Both TGF-β and PPAR-γ are expressed by monocyte/macrophages (22.Tontonoz P. Nagy L. Alvarez J. Thomazy V. Evans R.

These data may have relevance to both atherosclerotic foam cell formation mediated by CD36 as well as expression of other PPAR-γ-responsive inflammatory mediators expressed within vascular lesions."
https://openalex.org/W2008069164,"Abstract The presence of the copper ion at the active site of human wild type copper-zinc superoxide dismutase (CuZnSOD) is essential to its ability to catalyze the disproportionation of superoxide into dioxygen and hydrogen peroxide. Wild type CuZnSOD and several of the mutants associated with familial amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (FALS) (Ala4 → Val, Gly93 → Ala, and Leu38 → Val) were expressed inSaccharomyces cerevisiae. Purified metal-free (apoproteins) and various remetallated derivatives were analyzed by metal titrations monitored by UV-visible spectroscopy, histidine modification studies using diethylpyrocarbonate, and enzymatic activity measurements using pulse radiolysis. From these studies it was concluded that the FALS mutant CuZnSOD apoproteins, in direct contrast to the human wild type apoprotein, have lost their ability to partition and bind copper and zinc ions in their proper locations in vitro. Similar studies of the wild type and FALS mutant CuZnSOD holoenzymes in the “as isolated” metallation state showed abnormally low copper-to-zinc ratios, although all of the copper acquired was located at the native copper binding sites. Thus, the copper ions are properly directed to their native binding sites in vivo, presumably as a result of the action of the yeast copper chaperone Lys7p (yeast CCS). The loss of metal ion binding specificity of FALS mutant CuZnSODsin vitro may be related to their role in ALS."

Chinese hamster lung hemagglutinin saxitoxin tetrodotoxin polymerase chain reaction Sodium channels isolated from brain are composed of a central pore-forming α subunit and two auxiliary subunits, β1 and β2, which do not form the pore yet play critical roles in channel modulation and expression. A mutation in the β1 gene (SCN1B) has been implicated to play a role in febrile seizures and generalized epilepsy, GEFS+ (1.Wallace R.H. Wang D.W. Singh R. Scheffer I.E. George Jr., A.L.

The primary structure of the β1 subunit predicts an integral membrane glycoprotein with type I transmembrane topology as well as an extracellular Ig fold (2.Isom L.L. DeJongh K.S. Catterall W.A.

In oocytes, co-expression of type IIA (SCN2A) or μI (SCN4A) α subunits with β1 increases the proportion of sodium channels that function in a fast gating mode, accelerates the macroscopic rates of activation and inactivation, shifts the voltage dependence of inactivation in the hyperpolarizing direction, and increases the peak current amplitude consistent with increases in channel expression (4.Isom L.L.

However, previous studies showing the developmental time course of β1 protein expression in rat forebrain suggested that multiple β1 subunit isoforms may be present (12.McHugh-Sutkowski E. Catterall W.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 12393-12399Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). A 26-kDa β1-immunoreactive protein was observed at embryonic day 18. This protein was also expressed in adult adrenal gland, heart, skeletal muscle, and PC12 cells. After birth, there was a dramatic decrease in the level of this protein in brain, and little if any remained by postnatal day 14. The expression time course of this immunoreactive protein was complementary to that of β1 mRNA. Day 18 embryonic brain membranes also exhibited a low level of an immunoreactive peptide that migrated with an apparent molecular mass greater than 42 kDa. This protein was not detected in rat brain after birth. Other excitable tissues expressed multiple size forms of immunoreactive β1-like subunits as well. Adult rat heart and skeletal muscle membrane preparations exhibited 38- and 41-kDa bands on Western blots in addition to the 26-kDa band. The 41-kDa immunoreactive band observed in these studies was shown to be the adult rat brain isoform and was later identified as C1Aa.β1 (4.Isom L.L. DeJongh K.S. Patton D.E. Reber B.F.X. Offord J. Charbonneau H. Walsh K. Goldin A.L. Catterall W.A. Science. 1992; 256: 839-842Crossref PubMed Scopus (600) Google Scholar). The immunoreactive peptides identified in the previous study were detected with a polyclonal antibody raised against purified β1 subunits; thus, they could represent β1 subunit isoforms that contained significantly different mRNA sequences from C1Aa.β1 that may not have been detected using previous methods.To test this hypothesis, we screened a rat adrenal cDNA library with a probe encoding only the coding region of β1. The present study reports the molecular cloning and functional expression of β1A, a splice variant of the β1 gene that contains identical amino-terminal and extracellular Ig fold regions as β1 followed by a significantly different extracellular juxtamembrane domain, predicted transmembrane region, and predicted intracellular COOH-terminal domain. β1A mRNA is expressed early in embryonic brain development and then disappears after birth. Western blot analysis of membrane preparations using an antibody to a unique, extracellular region of β1A not found in β1 showed that β1A protein is expressed in adult rat heart, skeletal muscle, and adrenal gland but was not detected in adult rat brain or spinal cord. Immunocytochemical analysis of β1A expression in adult rat tissues revealed high expression in heart and dorsal root ganglion and selective expression in some areas of the brain and spinal cord. β1A functions to increase channel expression at the plasma membrane when coexpressed with αIIA subunits in CHL fibroblasts. Unlike β1, however, mean steady state inactivation curves for αβ1A-expressing cell lines were shifted to more positive potentials than the mean inactivation curves for cells expressing α alone. Previous studies showed that coexpression of α and β1 subunits in CHL cells shifted the voltage dependence of inactivation to more negative potentials compared with α alone (10.Isom L.L. Scheuer T.

Therefore, the novel, carboxyl-terminal domains of β1A may be important for electrophysiological function. It has been shown previously that the extracellular domain of β1 is essential for expression and function of the αβ1 complex in Xenopus oocytes (13.Chen C. Cannon S.C. Pflügers Arch. 1995; 431: 186-195Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar, 14.McCormick K.A. Isom L.L. Ragsdale D. Smith D. Scheuer T. Catterall W.A. J. Biol.

We propose that the extracellular Ig fold, common to β1 and β1A, is essential for the observed increases in channel expression levels. Thus, this report introduces a novel splice variant of β1, β1A, and adds to our understanding of β1 structure-function relationships in terms of channel expression levels and electrophysiology.DISCUSSIONA number of cases of intron retention have been reported in the literature, including alternative splicing of the genes encoding leukocyte-common antigen-related protein tyrosine phosphatase, CD44, effector cell protease receptor-1, the microtubule-associated protein tau, thyrotropin-releasing hormone receptor, and bovine growth hormone (29.Tabiti K.

In many cases, the retained intron contains an alternate, in-frame termination codon as well as a polyadenylation signal. Alternative splicing that results in retention of the intron in the primary transcript thus results in an isoform of the protein containing a novel carboxyl terminus. Interestingly, this is not the first report of intron retention in the β1 gene. Waxman and co-workers (36.Oh Y. Waxman S.G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 9985-9989Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar, 37.Dib-Hajj S.D. Waxman S.G. FEBS Lett. 1995; 377: 485-488Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar) have previously reported that intron 5 of β1 can be retained, creating a novel isoform that is expressed in rat brain, optic nerve, sciatic nerve, and skeletal muscle. This isoform contains an 86-nucleotide insert encoded by intron 5 in the 3′-untranslated region. While the intron retention reported previously does not alter the β1 coding sequence, our present data describe a very significant coding sequence change resulting in a novel carboxyl terminus.Effects of β1A on sodium currents and [3H]STX Binding Levels in CHL CellsThe most striking functional consequence of αIIA and β1A coexpression in CHL cells was a 2.5-fold increase in sodium current density compared with cells expressing αIIA subunits alone. This increase in current density reflected two distinct effects of β1A: 1) an increase in the proportion of cells expressing detectable sodium currents and 2) an increase in the level of functional sodium channels in expressing cells. Increases in sodium channel expression with β1A are similar to previous results obtained with the adult β1 isoform in both mammalian cells (10.Isom L.L. Scheuer T. Brownstein A.B. Ragsdale D.S. Murphy B.J. Catterall W.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 3306-3312Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (191) Google Scholar) and Xenopus oocytes (4.Isom L.L. DeJongh K.S. Patton D.E. Reber B.F.X. Offord J. Charbonneau H. Walsh K. Goldin A.L. Catterall W.A. Science. 1992; 256: 839-842Crossref PubMed Scopus (600) Google Scholar). These observations are consistent with the hypothesis that β1 and β1A subunits facilitate the expression of sodium channels and/or stabilize the channels in the plasma membrane and that the molecular basis for this function resides in the extracellular cell adhesion molecule domain common to the two isoforms. The results of our [3H]STX binding experiments support this hypothesis. We propose that interaction of the extracellular cell adhesion molecule domain (Ig fold) common to β1 and β1A with α may be responsible for the observed effects on channel expression levels. Consistent with this interpretation, two previous studies have shown that the extracellular domain of β1 is essential for modulation of both brain and skeletal muscle α subunits, whereas the intracellular carboxyl-terminal domain is not; truncated β1 subunits lacking the intracellular carboxyl terminus are fully functional in terms of kinetic modulation of brain and skeletal muscle α subunits expressed in Xenopus oocytes (13.Chen C. Cannon S.C. Pflügers Arch. 1995; 431: 186-195Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar, 14.McCormick K.A. Isom L.L. Ragsdale D. Smith D. Scheuer T. Catterall W.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 3954-3962Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar). Residues predicted to be in the Ig fold of β1 interact with type IIA α subunits (14.McCormick K.A. Isom L.L. Ragsdale D. Smith D. Scheuer T. Catterall W.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 3954-3962Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar). Thus, the extracellular cell adhesion domain common to β1 and β1A appears to be required for function.Sodium currents in β1A-expressing cell lines also exhibited subtle functional differences compared with the parent SNaIIA cell line. For example, inactivation curves in SNaIIAβ1A cell lines were shifted to slightly more positive potentials than inactivation curves for SNaIIA cells. In contrast as shown both here and in a previous study (10.Isom L.L. Scheuer T. Brownstein A.B. Ragsdale D.S. Murphy B.J. Catterall W.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 3306-3312Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (191) Google Scholar), coexpression of β1 with αIIA in CHL cells shifted inactivation to potentials approximately 10 mV more negative than for cells expressing αIIA alone. Perhaps the differences between these two β subunit isoforms located in the putative juxtamembrane and/or transmembrane domains are responsible for these subtle distinctions in functional effects. Makita et al. (38.Makita N. Bennett P.B. George Jr., A.L. J. Neurosci. 1996; 16: 7117-7127Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) reported that a β1/β2 subunit chimeric construct containing the extracellular region plus the first 6 residues of the transmembrane domain of β1 was sufficient to modulate sodium channel skeletal muscle α subunits expressed in oocytes. Interestingly, this construct included an additional segment of β1 (ANRDMASIVSEIMMYVL) that is located carboxyl-terminal to the intron 3 splice site and is therefore not present in β1A. In contrast, β1A contains a novel juxtamembrane region that is 55 amino acids larger than that found in β1. This structural difference may be responsible for the opposite effects on steady state inactivation by β1versus β1A.In addition to opposite effects on steady state inactivation, the voltage dependence of activation and the rate of channel inactivation were also different in one of the three β1A-expressing cell lines, compared with the parent SNaIIA cell line. Thus, whole cell electrophysiological data suggest that β1A subunits may subtly modulate various aspects of sodium channel function. Nevertheless, the differences between cell lines with and without β1A subunits in the properties of whole cell sodium currents were very small and/or not observed in all cell lines. Therefore, additional analysis, perhaps at the single channel level, will be necessary to resolve whether these small differences actually reflect modulation of sodium channel function by β1A or some other source of variability between cell lines.TTX-sensitive sodium channel α subunits expressed in brain (SCN1A, Ref. 39.Smith R.D.

Nature. 1996; 379: 257-262Crossref PubMed Scopus (908) Google Scholar) are much less sensitive or insensitive to modulation by β1 when co-expressed either in Xenopus oocytes or mammalian cells. A transcript encoding a predicted TTX-insensitive sodium channel (NaN/SNS-2/SCN11A) has been cloned but not yet expressed (45.Dib-Hajj S.D. Tyrrell L. Black J.A. Waxman S.G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 8963-8968Crossref PubMed Scopus (458) Google Scholar). Interestingly, heart, skeletal muscle, and dorsal root ganglia express both TTX-sensitive and -resistant sodium channel α subunits. (Primary cultures of cardiac myocytes express SCN1A, as assessed by Western blot analysis.) 2J. D. Malhotra and L. L. Isom, unpublished results. We have shown in the present study that these tissues also express β1A subunits. It will be interesting in the future to determine whether the spinal cord and brain contain unique populations of neurons expressing TTX-resistant channels and whether TTX-resistant channels are modulated by β1A. We also show that β1A subunits appear to be expressed in nonexcitable tissues such as the lung, where sodium channel α subunits would not be expected to be expressed. This finding raises the intriguing hypothesis that auxiliary β subunits may be expressed independently of α subunits to function as cell adhesion molecules. Recent results form our laboratory have shown that β1 and β2 interact homophilically in the absence of α subunits, resulting in cell aggregation and recruitment of the ankyrin cytoskeleton to the plasma membrane. 3J. D. Malhotra, M. Hortsch, and L. L. Isom, unpublished results. It will be interesting in the future to test the function of β1A as a cell adhesion molecule. Sodium channels isolated from brain are composed of a central pore-forming α subunit and two auxiliary subunits, β1 and β2, which do not form the pore yet play critical roles in channel modulation and expression. A mutation in the β1 gene (SCN1B) has been implicated to play a role in febrile seizures and generalized epilepsy, GEFS+ (1.Wallace R.H. Wang D.W. Singh R. Scheffer I.E. George Jr., A.L.

The primary structure of the β1 subunit predicts an integral membrane glycoprotein with type I transmembrane topology as well as an extracellular Ig fold (2.Isom L.L. DeJongh K.S. Catterall W.A. Neuron. 1994; 12: 1183-1194Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (489) Google Scholar, 3.Isom L.L. Catterall W.A. Nature. 1996; 383: 307-308Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). β1 subunits can be classified as members of the V-set of the Ig superfamily, which includes many cell adhesion molecules. β1 and α subunit co-expression has been well characterized in Xenopus oocytes and in mammalian cells. In oocytes, co-expression of type IIA (SCN2A) or μI (SCN4A) α subunits with β1 increases the proportion of sodium channels that function in a fast gating mode, accelerates the macroscopic rates of activation and inactivation, shifts the voltage dependence of inactivation in the hyperpolarizing direction, and increases the peak current amplitude consistent with increases in channel expression (4.Isom L.L. DeJongh K.S. Patton D.E. Reber B.F.X. Offord J. Charbonneau H. Walsh K. Goldin A.L. Catterall W.A. Science. 1992; 256: 839-842Crossref PubMed Scopus (600) Google Scholar, 5.Patton D.E. Isom L.L.

In Chinese hamster lung (CHL)1 cells, stable coexpression of β1 with αIIA results in increased channel expression levels at the plasma membrane as well as moderate hyperpolarizing shifts in the voltage dependence of channel activation and inactivation (10.Isom L.L.

Chem. 1995; 270: 3306-3312Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (191) Google Scholar). β1 mRNA is expressed only after birth in the developing brain (5.Patton D.E. Isom L.L. Catterall W.A. Goldin A.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 17649-17655Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar,11.Sashihara S. Oh Y. Black J.A. Waxman S.G. Brain Res. Mol. Brain Res. 1995; 34: 239-250Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). However, previous studies showing the developmental time course of β1 protein expression in rat forebrain suggested that multiple β1 subunit isoforms may be present (12.McHugh-Sutkowski E. Catterall W.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 12393-12399Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). A 26-kDa β1-immunoreactive protein was observed at embryonic day 18. This protein was also expressed in adult adrenal gland, heart, skeletal muscle, and PC12 cells. After birth, there was a dramatic decrease in the level of this protein in brain, and little if any remained by postnatal day 14. The expression time course of this immunoreactive protein was complementary to that of β1 mRNA. Day 18 embryonic brain membranes also exhibited a low level of an immunoreactive peptide that migrated with an apparent molecular mass greater than 42 kDa. This protein was not detected in rat brain after birth. Other excitable tissues expressed multiple size forms of immunoreactive β1-like subunits as well. Adult rat heart and skeletal muscle membrane preparations exhibited 38- and 41-kDa bands on Western blots in addition to the 26-kDa band. The 41-kDa immunoreactive band observed in these studies was shown to be the adult rat brain isoform and was later identified as C1Aa.β1 (4.Isom L.L. DeJongh K.S. Patton D.E. Reber B.F.X. Offord J. Charbonneau H. Walsh K. Goldin A.L. Catterall W.A. Science. 1992; 256: 839-842Crossref PubMed Scopus (600) Google Scholar). The immunoreactive peptides identified in the previous study were detected with a polyclonal antibody raised against purified β1 subunits; thus, they could represent β1 subunit isoforms that contained significantly different mRNA sequences from C1Aa.β1 that may not have been detected using previous methods. To test this hypothesis, we screened a rat adrenal cDNA library with a probe encoding only the coding region of β1. The present study reports the molecular cloning and functional expression of β1A, a splice variant of the β1 gene that contains identical amino-terminal and extracellular Ig fold regions as β1 followed by a significantly different extracellular juxtamembrane domain, predicted transmembrane region, and predicted intracellular COOH-terminal domain. β1A mRNA is expressed early in embryonic brain development and then disappears after birth. Western blot analysis of membrane preparations using an antibody to a unique, extracellular region of β1A not found in β1 showed that β1A protein is expressed in adult rat heart, skeletal muscle, and adrenal gland but was not detected in adult rat brain or spinal cord. Immunocytochemical analysis of β1A expression in adult rat tissues revealed high expression in heart and dorsal root ganglion and selective expression in some areas of the brain and spinal cord. β1A functions to increase channel expression at the plasma membrane when coexpressed with αIIA subunits in CHL fibroblasts. Unlike β1, however, mean steady state inactivation curves for αβ1A-expressing cell lines were shifted to more positive potentials than the mean inactivation curves for cells expressing α alone. Previous studies showed that coexpression of α and β1 subunits in CHL cells shifted the voltage dependence of inactivation to more negative potentials compared with α alone (10.Isom L.L. Scheuer T.

Therefore, the novel, carboxyl-terminal domains of β1A may be important for electrophysiological function. It has been shown previously that the extracellular domain of β1 is essential for expression and function of the αβ1 complex in Xenopus oocytes (13.Chen C. Cannon S.C.

https://openalex.org/W2017430826,"Auxilin is a brain-specific DnaJ homolog that is required for Hsc70 to dissociate clathrin from bovine brain clathrin-coated vesicles. However, Hsc70 is also involved in uncoating clathrin-coated vesicles formed at the plasma membrane of non-neuronal cells suggesting that an auxilin homolog may be required for uncoating in these cells. One candidate is cyclin G-associated kinase (GAK), a 150-kDa protein expressed ubiquitously in various tissues. GAK has a C-terminal domain with high sequence similarity to auxilin; like auxilin this C-terminal domain consists of three subdomains, an N-terminal tensin-like domain, a clathrin-binding domain, and a C-terminal J-domain. Western blot analysis shows that GAK is present in rat liver, bovine testes, and bovine brain clathrin-coated vesicles. More importantly, liver clathrin-coated vesicles, which contain GAK but not auxilin, are uncoated by Hsc70, suggesting that GAK acts as an auxilin homolog in non-neuronal cells. In support of this view, the clathrin-binding domain of GAK alone induces clathrin polymerization into baskets and the combined clathrin-binding domain and J-domain of GAK supports uncoating of AP180-clathrin baskets by Hsc70 at pH 7 and induces Hsc70 binding to clathrin baskets at pH 6. Immunolocalization studies suggest that GAK is a cytosolic protein that is concentrated in the perinuclear region; it appears to be highly associated with the trans-Golgi where the budding of clathrin-coated vesicles occurs. We propose that GAK is a required cofactor for the uncoating of clathrin-coated vesicles by Hsc70 in non-neuronal cells."

In addition to their evident role in the recovery and maintenance of osmotic balance, these solutes should play an important role on the behavior of cellular macromolecules, for example in the process of protein folding. Using a random chemical mutagenesis approach, a conditional lysine auxotrophic mutant was obtained. The growth of this mutant was restored by addition of either lysine or osmoprotectants including glycine betaine (GB) in the minimal medium. The growth rate increased proportionally with the augmentation of the intracellular GB concentration. The mutation was located in the lysA gene and resulted in the substitution of the Ser at position 384 by Phe of the diaminopimelate decarboxylase (DAPDC), which catalyzes the conversion ofmeso-diaminopimelate to l-lysine. We purified both the wild type DAPDC and the mutated DAPDC-sf and demonstrated that GB was capable of activating DAPDC-sf in vitro, thus confirming the in vivo results. Most importantly, we showed that the activation was correlated with a conformational change of DAPDC-sf.

Bacteria submitted to a severe hyperosmotic stress instantaneously lose a large amount of their intracellular water to balance the osmotic strength between intracellular and extracellular spaces. The subsequent decrease of cellular water activity together with the loss of cell turgor lead to lessen the bacterial cell expansion rate (1.Csonka L.N. Epstein W. Neidhardt F.C. In Escherichia coli and Salmonella: Cellular and Molecular Biology. ASM Press, Washington, D. C.1996: 1210-1223Google Scholar). Surviving such injuring conditions implies the reversion of water flux across the cell membrane; this can be achieved by amassing highly soluble compounds termed osmolytes (2.Csonka L.N. Hanson A.D. Annu. Rev. Microbiol. 1991; 45: 569-606Crossref PubMed Scopus (641) Google Scholar, 3.Lucht J.M. Bremer E. FEMS Microbiol. Rev. 1994; 14: 3-20Crossref PubMed Scopus (216) Google Scholar). Thus, Escherichia colicells rapidly take up high amounts of potassium ions (4.Cayley S. Lewis B.A. Record Jr., M.T. J. Bacteriol. 1992; 174: 1586-1595Crossref PubMed Scopus (160) Google Scholar, 5.Sutherland L. Cairney J. Elmore M.J. Booth I.R. Higgins C.F. J. Bacteriol. 1986; 168: 805-814Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and subsequently increase their glutamate content to balance electric charges. To avoid the perturbing effect of elevated ionic strength, K+-glutamate can be progressively replaced by organic osmolytes that behave neutral at physiological pH (6.Dinnbier U. Limpinsel E. Schmid R. Bakker E.P. Arch. Microbiol. 1988; 150: 348-357Crossref PubMed Scopus (297) Google Scholar). Such compounds, termed compatible solutes (7.Brown A.D. Bacteriol. Rev. 1976; 40: 803-846Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), may be endogenously synthesized or imported from the surrounding medium (3.Lucht J.M. Bremer E. FEMS Microbiol. Rev. 1994; 14: 3-20Crossref PubMed Scopus (216) Google Scholar, 8.Csonka L.N. Microbiol. Rev. 1989; 53: 121-147Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Imported compatible solutes generally confer a high degree of osmotic tolerance to injured cells. Among these so-called osmoprotectants, glycine betaine (GB)1 is by far the most effective and the most commonly assayed for hyperosmotic purposes. In addition to the obvious predominant role they play in cellular osmotic adjustment, internalized and accumulated osmoprotectants should directly participate in other intracellular processes. Protective as well as stabilizing effects of betaine and other solutes on proteins denaturation because of increased salinity or temperature have been reported (9.Arakawa T. Timasheff S.N. Biophys. J. 1985; 47: 411-414Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (831) Google Scholar, 10.Murata N. Mohanty P.S. Hayashi H. Papageorgiou G.C.

Reed R.H. Stewart W.D.P. J. Gen. Microbiol. 1984; 130: 2169-2175Google Scholar). It is tempting to extrapolate these results in vivo; however, bacteria submitted to elevated temperature do not accumulate osmoprotectants. Similarly bacteria growing in high salinity media and in the presence of low amounts of osmoprotectant accumulate the latter at the expense of salts. Consequently in vitrodata concerning the beneficial effect of molar range of osmoprotectants on the protection of enzymes against deleterious effects of salts and temperature could not be extrapolated in vivo. Furthermore we can question whether bacterial osmoprotectants are neutral, in vivo, as commonly admitted (1.Csonka L.N. Epstein W. Neidhardt F.C. In Escherichia coli and Salmonella: Cellular and Molecular Biology. ASM Press, Washington, D. C.1996: 1210-1223Google Scholar), or whether they interact with enzymes, inducing thereby structural and functional modifications. Because in situ monitoring of enzyme activity is rather difficult, this aspect has been scarcely studied. It was recently shown that N-trimethylamine oxide induces in vitrorefolding of misfolded proteins (13.Qu Y. Bolen C.L. Bolen D.W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 9268-9273Crossref PubMed Scopus (270) Google Scholar, 14.Baskakov I. Bolen D.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 4831-4834Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (316) Google Scholar). It is therefore tempting to postulate that such effects may also occur in vivo with osmoprotectants; hence, mutants unable to grow unless an osmoprotectant is accumulated within the cell could be identified and used to develop an osmoprotectant sensitive enzymatic probe. In this report we describe the development of a lysA mutant of E. coli, which grows only when glycine betaine is intracellularly accumulated. An enzymatic probe derived from this mutant was constructed, allowing us to ascertain that glycine betaine induces, both in vitro and in vivo, the folding of the modified enzyme. Thus glycine betaine is able to induce the transition from an inactive to an active conformation of the enzyme, thereby sharing properties somehow similar to those assigned to chaperones. TheE. coli strains and plasmids used in this study are listed in Table I. Bacterial cells were grown aerobically in LB medium or in M63 minimal medium with glucose or lactose as carbon sources at 37 °C (15.Miller J.H. Experiments in Molecular Genetics.

Experiments in Molecular Genetics. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1972: 125-129Google Scholar). Mutants were replica-plated on M63 containing or not 0.5 m NaCl and 1 mm GB. Colonies growing only in presence of NaCl and GB were selected. Only a lysine auxotrophic mutant, N27, was retained for this study. All manipulations with recombinant DNA were carried out according to standard procedures (16.Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. 2nd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar) and the specifications of manufacturers. Chromosomal DNA of strains K10 and N27 was digested with HindIII and ligated with HindIII-cleaved pUN21. The ligation mixture was transformed into JM1637 (ΔlysA-lysR). Cells containing a plasmid bearing the wild type lysA gene were selected on M63 minimal medium with ampicilin and tetracycline. Transformants containing a plasmid with the lysA27 allele were selected on the same plates supplemented with 0.5 m NaCl and 1 mm GB. All transformants contained plasmids carrying an identical 6.7-kilobase pair HindIII insert that covers thelysA region of E. coli chromosome (17.Stragier P. Borne F. Richaud F. Richaud C. Patte J.C. J. Bacteriol. 1983; 156: 1198-1203Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) (see Fig.1). The lysA27 gene was isolated by subcloning a 2.3-kilobase pair HapI-HindIII fragment on pBluescript SK− plasmid yielding pN27 (see Fig. 1). This plasmid was able to complement JM1637 on M63–0.5 m NaCl-1 mm GB medium but not on M63 basal medium. The same procedure allowed the recovery of the wild type lysA gene yielding pK10 (see Fig. 1); this plasmid was able to complement JM1637 defect in M63 minimal medium. The nucleotide sequence of pK10 and pN27 inserts was determined by the dideoxy chain termination method (18.Sanger F. Nicklen S. Coulson A.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1977; 74: 5463-5467Crossref PubMed Scopus (52615) Google Scholar). The 5′ part oflysA gene was amplified by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) using pK10 as a template and using primers LysNdeI (5′-CCCCATATGCCACATTCACT-3′) and LysEco3 (5′-CGCCTCTTCACCCTGTTG-3′). The resulting PCR product, possessing an engineered NdeI site at the ATG start codon and the natural EcoRI site within lysA, was digested with NdeI andEcoRI and inserted between the corresponding sites of pET22b+ yielding pET-LA5. This places the 5′ part of lysAgene, with its authentic ATG start codon, under the optimized transcriptional and translational signals of the vector. The 3′ end oflysA gene carrying or not the mutation was amplified by PCR of pK10 or pN27 with the primers LysEco5 (5′-GCACATTGGTTCTGGCG-3′) and LysXho (5′-CCCCTCGAGCAATTCCAG-3′). The resulting PCR products possessed the natural EcoRI site of lysA and an engineeredXhoI site just before the stop codon. The amplified DNA, cleaved by EcoRI and XhoI, was inserted between the EcoRI-XhoI sites of pET-LA5, giving pET-LA (carrying the lysA) or pET-LA27 (carrying lysA27) (see Fig. 1). These vectors contained lysA orlysA27 fused to six contiguous histidine codon at the 3′ extremity; they are expressed from the T7 Φ10 promoter in strain BL21. The nucleotide sequence of pET-LA and pET-LA27 was confirmed. The half-end of tagged genes were transferred from pET-LA to pK10 yielding pK10-H6 and from pET-LA27 to pN27 creating pN27-H6 (Fig.1). The tagged genes are transcribed under the control of the lac promoter on these plasmids. The BL21(DE3)/pET-LA or pET-LA27 strains were grown in 900 ml of LB medium supplemented with ampicilin (50 μg/liter). When theA 570 of the culture reached 0.6, the synthesis of T7 RNA polymerase was induced by the addition of isopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside (final concentration, 1 mm) and cells were grown for an additional 2 h at 37 °C. Proteins extraction and purification steps were performed at 4 °C using nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid-agarose column according to manufacturer recommendations (Qiagen). Both wild type and mutated diaminopimelate decarboxylases were eluted at 150 mm imidazol. The proteins obtained contain only the diaminopimelate decarboxylase when analyzed on SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis that was performed according to Laemmli (19.Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (207031) Google Scholar). Protein concentration was determined according to Bradford (20.Bradford M.M. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 72: 248-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (215700) Google Scholar). Diaminopimelate decarboxylase assay was performed as described (21.Shimura Y. Vogel H.J. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1966; 118: 396-404Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Size exclusion chromatography was achieved by using two Superose 6 columns in series according to the manufacturer's instruction (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). Columns were equilibrated with 40 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.6), 200 mm NaCl-1 mm benzamidine and calibrated with α-amylase (200 kDa), alcohol dehydrogenase (150 kDa), bovine serum albumin (66 kDa), carbonic anhydrase (29 kDa), and cytochromec (12.5 kDa). 200 μl of purified protein (about 2 mg of protein) was applied onto the columns and were eluted at 0.2 ml/min with the same buffer used for column equilibration. Fractions were collected, separated on SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, and analyzed by Coomassie Blue staining. [methyl-14C]GB (2 GBq mmol−1) was prepared from [methyl-14C]choline, 2 GBq mmol−1 (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) according to Ikutaet al. (22.Ikuta S. Imamura S. Misaki H. Horiuti Y. J. Biochem. (Tokyo). 1977; 82: 1741-1749Crossref PubMed Scopus (201) Google Scholar). The GB content of the cells grown in M63 medium with various concentration of NaCl was determined in the presence of 1 mm [14C]GB as described previously (23.Jebbar M. Talibart R. Gloux K. Bernard T. Blanco C. J. Bacteriol. 1992; 174: 5027-5035Crossref PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar).meso-[14C-U]Diaminopimelate (12.9 GBq mmol−1; CEA, France) uptake was monitored as for GB (23.Jebbar M. Talibart R. Gloux K. Bernard T. Blanco C. J. Bacteriol. 1992; 174: 5027-5035Crossref PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar). Tryptophan fluorescence emission spectra of the purified wild type diaminopimelate decarboxylase (DAPDC) and the mutated enzyme (DAPDC-sf) were recorded with an SLM-Aminco 8100 spectrofluorimeter operating in the ratio mode. Excitation and emission slits were set to 4 nm. Emission spectra were collected by using an excitation wavelength of 295 nm. All emission data were corrected for instrumentation by using correction factors provided by the supplier, and the buffer contribution was removed by the proper emission subtraction. Tryptophan fluorescence quenching measurements were performed by using acrylamide, a collisional quencher having an efficiency γ equal to unity (24.Etfink M.R. Ghiron C.A. J. Phys. Chem. 1976; 80: 486-493Crossref Scopus (570) Google Scholar). As the DAPDC protein contains four tryptophanyl residues (positions 29, 140, 167, and 248), the Lehrer plot (25.Lehrer S.S. Biochemistry. 1971; 10: 3254-3263Crossref PubMed Scopus (1677) Google Scholar) was used to also determine the tryptophan-accessible fraction to acrylamide. Data treatment was essentially performed as described (26.Zargarian L. Le Tilly V. Jamin N. Chaffotte A. Gabrielsen O.S. Toma F. Alpert B. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 1921-1929Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). The steady-state fluorescence anisotropy of DAPDC labeled with the fluorescence probe dansyl was investigated as described (27.Fernando T. Royer C. Biochemistry. 1992; 31: 3429-3441Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). Secondary structure analysis of deuterated DAPDC and DAPDC-sf was carried out by Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy of the amide I′ band. IR spectra were collected by using a Magna 460 from Nicolet equipped with a deuterated triglycine sulfate detector. The samples were placed in a CaF2 cell with a Teflon spacer of 0.05 mm. Band component analysis was achieved by firstly estimating the number and position of elementary components from the second derivative peaks in the 1600–1700 cm−1domain (28.Dong H. Huang P. Caughey W.S. Biochemistry. 1990; 29: 3303-3308Crossref PubMed Scopus (1237) Google Scholar). Secondly, these parameters were introduced as first guess for band curve fitting by nonlinear regression analysis. A 1-methyl-3-nitro-1-nitrosoguanidine mutagenesis was undertaken onE. coli K10. Conditional auxotrophic mutants able to grow only in the presence of 0.5 m NaCl and 1 mm GB were isolated. Among them, a stable lysine conditional auxotroph (N27) required lysine for its growth in M63 medium. Alternatively, the growth of N27 was restored by the addition of 1 mm GB in M63 medium containing 0.5 m NaCl, 0.5 m KCl, or 0.9m sucrose; these three media generate the same osmotic strength of 1.2 osmol/kg H2O. However, in the presence of the free permeant glycerol (0.9 m), GB was unable to promote growth. Thus, growth restoration resulting from GB addition is linked to osmolarity rather than to ionic strength or water activity. When 1 mm of the osmoprotectants ectoine, proline, dimethylsulfonioacetate, or dimethylsulfoniopropionate were added to 0.5 m NaCl M63 medium, the growth rate of N27 was similar to that observed in the presence of 1 mm GB. Hence the reversion of N27 auxotrophy is not GB specific but seems to be dependent on the presence of any osmoprotectant. Addition of diaminopimelate, a biosynthetic precursor of bacterial lysine, to the medium was unable to promote the growth of N27, although it was actively taken up by the cells. Thus N27 seems affected in the last step of lysine biosynthesis,i.e. in DAPDC activity. Indeed, the enzyme assay confirmed that DAPDC activity was absent from the crude extract of N27. The phage P1-mediated transduction experiment revealed 20% cotransduction linkage of the mutation with argA, which suggests that the mutation was located in the region of lysA-lysR (29.Stragier P. Patte J.C. J. Mol. Biol. 1983; 168: 333-350Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). Further complementation experiments of N27 by pLA17 (lysA +) or pLA40 (lysR +) revealed that N27 has a mutation in lysA gene. The corresponding allele was named lysA27. The wild typelysA and the mutated lysA27 genes were cloned and sequenced. The comparison of the two sequences allowed identification of a single mutation corresponding to a C-T transversion inlysA sequence, which induced the substitution of Ser384 by Phe at the protein level. This mutated enzyme was designated as DAPDC-sf. To study the dependence of lysA27 mutant upon the intracellular GB level, the growth of the strains K10 and N27 was followed in M63 medium of increasing salt content added or not with 1 mm GB (Fig. 2). In the absence of GB, the growth rate of K10 slowed down when NaCl concentration was increased and was abolished over 0.5 mNaCl. The addition of 1 mm GB to the hyperosmotic medium allowed improvement of salt tolerance of bacterial cells. The intracellular GB concentration augmented in parallel to the NaCl content in growth medium. However, despite GB accumulation, the growth rate of K10 decreased when the amount of salt was raised (Fig. 2). The mutant N27 was unable to grow in the medium deprived of GB and supplemented or not with NaCl. However, in the presence of GB, the growth rate of N27 augmented proportionally with increasing concentration of NaCl that stimulates the uptake and intracellular accumulation of GB. Therefore, the growth rate of N27 was in direct proportion to intracellular GB content and became identical to that of K10 at concentrations of NaCl higher than 0.5 m (Fig.2). The above mentioned results indicate an in vivo activation of the mutated DAPDC. To assess the activation mechanism, the wild type and mutated DAPDC were purified. To facilitate the purification, a His6 codon tag was introduced at the 3′ extremity of the lysA andlysA27 genes on the plasmids pK10-H6 and pN27-H6, respectively. Growth parameters of the strains JM1637 (ΔlysA-lysR) containing pK10-H6 or pN27-H6 were similar to those observed with K10 and N27 (Fig. 2) or with JM1673 carrying pK10 or pN27 (data not shown), respectively. Therefore, the addition of the His6 tag at the C-terminal of wild type DAPDC or mutated DAPDC-sf did not affect the enzymatic properties. The cellular content of the two His tag enzymes was quantified after partial purification using Ni2+-NTA agarose columns. The values obtained were identical for the two strains in all growth conditions. These results clearly showed that the restoration of the growth of N27 does not result from an increase of enzyme synthesis but rather from the activation, by GB, of the enzymatic activity of DAPDC-sf. DAPDC and DAPDC-sf proteins were purified to homogeneity. Analysis of these proteins by size exclusion chromatography revealed that both DAPDC and DAPDC-sf were located in fractions corresponding to the molecular mass marker of 50 kDa. Because the molecular mass of DAPDC deduced from lysA sequence is 46.177 kDa, the DAPDC must function as a monomer. This result also rules out the possibility that the loss of enzyme activity of DAPDC-sf would result from a failure of oligomerization. The activity of purified DAPDC and DAPDC-sf were measured in vitro in presence or absence of GB (Fig.3). DAPDC activity was poorly affected by increasing GB concentration. Its K m increased from 2 to 3.5 mm, and V max increased from 48 to 66 μmol of lysine formed/min/mg of protein in the presence of 1m GB compared with that from medium deprived of betaine. In contrast, GB exhibited a strong stimulating effect on DAPDC-sf activity. This mutated protein was almost completely inactive in the absence of GB, and its activity increased proportionally to GB concentration in the assay medium (Fig. 3). In the absence of GB, theV max value of DAPDC-sf was less than 0.01 μmol of lysine formed/min/mg of protein, and its K m could not be calculated. In the presence of 1 m GB theV max increased to 4.4 μmol of lysine formed/min/mg of protein, and the K m value was 62 mm. Although these values are much different from those of the wild type enzyme, the 400-fold increase ofV max of the mutated DAPDC-sf is still significant. Therefore, GB is capable of activating the mutated DAPDC-sf, a result consistent with its capacity to restore the prototrophic phenotype of N27. The partial activation might result from the lack of pyridoxal phosphate cofactor in the mutated DAPDC-sf as observed by UV-visible absorption spectra analysis. Our attempt to improve the in vitro activation by adding crude extracts in the reaction solution was not successful. Furthermore, GB-dependent activation curves were the same for DAPDC-sf present in the crude extracts of JM1637/pN27 or JM1637/pN27-H6 (data not shown). Therefore, the addition of the His tag did not affect the activation of DAPDC-sf by GB. To understand the mechanism of GB-assisted in vivo activation of the mutated DAPDC-sf, the relationship between the structure and activity of DAPDC-sf was investigated in vitro by various approaches. UV-visible absorption spectra of both DAPDC and DAPDC-sf molecules (data not shown) indicated that the aromatic absorption band of DAPDC-sf remained roughly unaltered compared with the one of DAPDC. Upon selective excitation of tryptophan residues (Fig.4), the fluorescence emission spectrum of DAPDC-sf presented a total fluorescence intensity about 2-fold higher than that of DAPDC, whereas a maximum emission wavelength at 328 nm was observed for both enzymes. Such a λ max of fluorescence emission indicates either that the Trp residues are deeply buried into the protein bulk (30.Burstein E.A. Vedenkina N. Ivkova M.N. Photochem. Photobiol. 1973; 18: 263-279Crossref PubMed Scopus (1085) Google Scholar) or that the indol rings interact with hydrophobic residues. The large enhancement of Trp fluorescence in DAPDC-sf may not arise from an altered exposure of Trp residues to the solvent. To assess this point, the secondary structures of DAPDC and DAPDC-sf enzymes were investigated through infrared spectroscopy in the amide I′ band domain. DAPDC spectrum (Fig.5) is composed of two major peaks located at 1642 and 1652 cm−1, which can be assigned to random coil and α-helix, respectively. The α-helix component features 76% of the total amide I′ band area. The DAPDC-sf IR spectrum (Fig. 5) is dominated by a large random coil component (1641 cm−1), which features as much as 84% of the total band area. A weaker band, absent in DAPDC spectrum, is located at 1671 cm−1 and may feature β-sheets or, more likely, turns and represents 16% of the band area. It should be emphasized that, opposite to DAPDC, no helical structure is apparent in DAPDC-sf. Hence, as a result of the mutation, the DAPDC secondary structure shifts from a mainly helical protein to a rather unordered protein displaying a low β-sheet or turns content.Figure 5Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy spectra of the amide I′ band of DAPDC and DAPDC-sf. Protein concentration was 10 mg/ml. Spectra are the average of 128 scans collected at a 2 cm−1 resolution. The buffer contribution was interactively subtracted from the protein spectrum to yield a flat base line in the 2000–1800 cm−1 domain. The figure displays the amide I′ band contour of proteins along with the underlying components resolved by band decomposition as described in the text.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) To probe whether these structural alterations have repercussions on protein fluctuations, molecular dynamics was probed by collisional quenching experiments in the presence of increasing acrylamide concentrations. Fig. 6 displays the Lehrer plots of DAPDC and DAPDC-sf. Linear regression of the data yields similar accessible fractions of 1 for both DAPDC and DAPDC-sf molecules. Assuming that each Trp residue has the same quantum yield (which is likely because the Stern-Volmer plot yields a straight line), this finding allows to assess that all of the four Trp residues are accessible to acrylamide in both the wild type and mutated enzymes. However, the different slopes indicate that the quenching constantK is largely altered as a consequence of the mutation. As estimated from data, the DAPDC exhibits a quenching constantK of 3.51 m−1 versus2.08 m−1 for the DAPDC-sf. This may indicate that the protein fluctuations in the Trp environments are more constrained in DAPDC-sf compared with DAPDC. As a whole, this in vitro study clearly states that the loss of biological activity arises from large structural and dynamic alterations of the enzyme, which indicates that the mutated enzyme is not properly folded. To study the relation between activation and conformational change, the effect of 1 m GB on the DAPDC-sf fluorescence emission spectrum was investigated (Fig. 4). The presence of GB drastically affects the Trp fluorescence of the DAPDC-sf in the sense that it restores the emission spectrum observed with the DAPDC. Indeed 1m GB induces a 2-fold decrease in total fluorescence intensity without any Stokes shift variation. Thus, the fluorescence emission properties of Trp in DAPDC and DAPDC-sf with 1 mGB are very similar. A kinetic study of this transconformation has been performed by monitoring both the GB-induced Trp fluorescence decrease at 340 nm (Fig. 7) and the global protein tumbling (data not shown) as a function of time. Data fitting of the Trp emission decay leads to the conclusion that the transconformation is best described by a single exponential; this implies that the protein folding is ruled by a two-state equilibrium with relaxation time τ = 9.8 min ± 0.7 (95% confidence interval). Dansyl labeling experiments, which permit probing the global enzyme tumbling through fluorescence anisotropy, further supports the proposed mechanism of action of GB on the enzyme folding. The observed anisotropies were 0."

The vertebrate retina offers a distinct advantage in studying gene expression since it contains large numbers of well defined cell types, such as photoreceptor cells. Photoreceptor cells are highly specialized to convert light energy into neuronal impulses, a process which involves many proteins, several of which have been well characterized such as opsin, interphotoreceptor retinoid-binding protein (IRBP),1 and phosphodiesterase (4.Stryer L. Cold Spring Harbor Symp. Quant. Biol. 1988; 53: 283-294Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Arrestin, also known as S-antigen, accumulates to high levels in the outer segments of retinal photoreceptor cells, where it down-regulates the phototransduction cascade (5.Kuhn H. Hall S.W. Wilden U. FEBS Lett. 1984; 176: 473-478Crossref PubMed Scopus (277) Google Scholar). The transcriptional efficiency and tissue specificity of a given gene are determined by the specific combination of regulatory factors that assemble on the gene's regulatory elements to form the transcription initiation complex.

The RX homeobox gene has been found to be essential for normal vertebrate eye development, and its mis-expression has profound effects on eye morphology (1.Mathers P.H. Grinberg A. Mahon K.A. Jamrich M. Nature. 1997; 387: 603-607Crossref PubMed Scopus (582) Google Scholar). Xenopus embryos injected with RX mRNA develop ectopic retinal tissue and exhibit hyperproliferation in the neural retina. Mouse embryos homozygous for a null allele of this gene fail to form optic cups and therefore do not develop eyes. It is clear that the RX gene family plays a crucial role in the establishment and/or proliferation of retinal progenitor cells. Other homeobox proteins, especially the transcriptional regulatory protein Pax6, play an important role in vertebrate and invertebrate eye formation. Mutations which affect the function of Pax6 result in severe eye malformations known as Aniridia in humans and small eye syndrome in mice (8.Hill R.E. Favor J. Hogan B.L. Ton C.C. Saunders G.F.

Another homeodomain protein, CRX, binds to the OTX regulatory sequence found upstream of several photoreceptor cell-specific genes and can stimulate transcriptional activity of the opsin and IRBP promoters in non-retinal cells (2.Chen S. Wang Q.L. Nie Z. Sun H. Lennon G. Copeland N.G. Gillbert D.J. Jenkins N.A. Zack D.J. Neuron. 1997; 19: 1017-1030Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (575) Google Scholar). Moreover, mutation of the CRX gene induces a cone-rod dystrophy in humans (9.Freund C.L. Gregory-Evans C.Y. Furukawa T. Papaioannou M. Looser J. Ploder L. Bellingham J. Ng D. Herbrick J.A.S. Duncan A. Scherer S.W. Tsui L.C. Loutradis-Anagnostou A. Jacobson S.G. Cepko C.L. Bhattacharya S.S. McInnes R.R. Cell. 1997; 91: 543-553Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (455) Google Scholar). Thus, CRX is a novel photoreceptor cell-specific factor and plays a crucial role in the differentiation of photoreceptor cells. We have previously identified the photoreceptor conserved element 1 (PCE-1) consensus sequence which is found in the functionally important regulatory regions of all known photoreceptor cell-specific genes. The same nuclear regulatory factors which bind to the arrestin PCE-1 site also recognize PCE-1 sites in the promoter regions of other vertebrate photoreceptor-specific genes (10.Kikuchi T. Raji K. Breitman M.L. Shinohara T. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 4400-4408Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar). A factor-binding site with the same core sequence as PCE-1 has also been identified as Ret1 in the 5′-flanking region of the rat opsin gene (11.Morabito M.A., Yu, X. Barnstable C.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 9667-9672Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). These results suggest that the PCE-1 and Ret1 sites are structurally and perhaps functionally the same. Recently, a factor designated Erx was found to bind to the Ret 1 site (12.Martinez J.A. Barnstable J.C. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1998; 250: 175-180Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). Here we have isolated a human homeodomain-containing protein RX, which binds to the PCE-1/Ret1 site and activates the TATA-less arrestin promoter (10.Kikuchi T. Raji K. Breitman M.L. Shinohara T. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 4400-4408Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar, 13.Smale S.T. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1997; 1351: 73-88Crossref PubMed Scopus (501) Google Scholar) and IRBP promoter. Our study established that RX is a transcriptional regulatory protein which binds to a regulatory region found in many retina-specific genes and up-regulates expression of these genes. Furthermore, our study suggested that two individual elements (PCE-1 and OTX) and two different factors (RX and CRX) are necessary for stimulating expression of photoreceptor cell-specific genes. The random-primed λgt11 human retina library (CLONTECH Laboratories, Palo Alto, CA) was screened by the Southwestern method (14.Singh H. LeBowitz J.H. Baldwin Jr., A.S. Sharp P.A. Cell. 1988; 52: 415-423Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (419) Google Scholar). Oligonucleotides were synthesized by the Life Technologies, Inc. Custom Primers Service (Grand Island, NY). The oligonucleotides containing mouse PCE-1 sites were annealed, 5′ end-labeled with [γ-32P]ATP (NEN Life Science Products, Boston, MA) and T4 polynucleotide kinase, and concatenated with T4 DNA ligase. The average final length of probe 1 and probe 2 was approximately 200 bp. Probe 1 was GCGCAAGCTTTCAATTAGCTATTTTCGAAAGTTAATCGATAACGCG and Probe 2, CCAAAAGCTTTCAATTAGCTATTTTCGAAAGTTAATCGATAAGGTT. Bacteriophage (2 × 105 per dish) were plated withEscherichia coli Y1090 on 120-cm2 LB plates and incubated at 42 °C for 3.5 h. Nitrocellulose filters (BA-S 85TM; Schleicher & Schuell Inc., Keene, NH) impregnated with 10 mmisopropylthio-β-d-galactopyranoside were then overlaid onto the cultures and incubation continued at 37 °C overnight. The filters were lifted, air-dried, and submerged for 10 min in 250 ml of binding buffer (12 mm HEPES, pH 7.9, 12 mm KCl, 0.6 mm MgCl2, 1.2 mmdithiothreitol) containing 6 m guanidine hydrochloride. The filters were washed for 10 min with gentle shaking in the same volume of the binding buffer without guanidine hydrochloride. To maximize renaturation of the proteins, we repeated this cycle (binding buffer plus 6 m guanidine hydrochloride followed by binding buffer alone) four times. The filters were blocked with 250 ml of binding buffer containing 5% nonfat skim milk for 4 h at 4 °C with gentle shaking. They were incubated with gentle shaking at 4 °C overnight with labeled DNA probe (106 cpm/ml) in 250 ml of binding buffer supplemented with 0.25% skim milk. The filters were washed 3 times with 500 ml of binding buffer containing 0.25% skim milk and 50 mm KCl for 10 min at room temperature. The filters were dried on 3MM paper and exposed to Fuji x-ray Film (Fuji Film Co., Tokyo, Japan) overnight at −70 °C. The 5′ fragment (479 bp) and 3′ fragment (856 bp) of the hRx cDNA were 32P-labeled with T7 QuickPrimeTM Kit (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) and used to screen the human retina cDNA library. Bacteriophage (5 × 105) were plated with E. coli strain Y1090 onto 120-cm2 plates and grown 37 °C for 8 h. Detailed procedures were described elsewhere (15.Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning, A Laboratory Manual. 2nd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar). We produced RX and CRX as GST fusion proteins in anE. coli expression system. Because there was a stop codon upstream of the translation initiation codon of hRx, a PCR primer (TCCCGGAATTCCCCATGCACCTG) was designed with anEcoRI site just upstream of the translation initiation codon of the hRx cDNA, and a second PCR primer (GGACCTCTGGTAGGTTGACCTTG) was designed to introduce EcoNI site into the 3′ non-coding region of the hRx cDNA. These primers were used to PCR amplify 10 ng of DNA containing the entire coding region of hRx cDNA (16.Innis M.A. Gelfand D.H. Sninsky J.J. White T.J. PCR Protocols, A Guide to Method and Application. Academic Press, San Diego, CA1990Google Scholar). The PCR amplification product (548 bp) was blunt end ligated into the HincII site of the pBlueScript II SK+ (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA). After confirming the fidelity of the PCR amplification by DNA sequence analysis, the fragment between the XhoI site in the pBlueScript and EcoNI site in the PCR product was subcloned such that it replaced the XhoI/EcoNI fragment in the original hRx cDNA/pBlueScript construct. The EcoRI fragment of this new hRx cDNA was subcloned into the EcoRI site of pGEX4T-1 (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech), and the final ligation creates an in-frame fusion of the GST and hRx coding sequences. The cDNA for human CRX (provided by Dr. D.J. Zack, Johns Hopkin University) was subcloned into the BamHI and XhoI sites of pGEX4T-1 to create a similar in-frame fusion between GST and hCRX. These two GST fusion constructs were expressed in the E. coli strain BL21. The bacteria were cultured in 25 ml of LB medium with 0.1 mg/ml ampicillin at 37 °C for 3–4 h (to anA 600 of 0.6), then 0.2 mmisopropylthio-β-d-galactopyranoside was added and the incubation continued for an additional 4–6 h. The bacteria were harvested and resuspended in 1 ml of bacteria lysis buffer (50 mm Tris, pH 8.0, 200 mm NaCl, 1.5 mm EDTA, pH 8.0). The bacterial suspensions were treated with 1 mg/ml lysozyme, 5 mm dithiothreitol, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride and sonicated for 1 min. After centrifugation at 20,000 × g for 20 min, the supernatant was mixed with 30 μl of glutathione-Sepharose 4B (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) and incubated for 1 h at room temperature. The Sepharose was washed 3 times with bacteria lysis buffer, then mixed with glutathione reducing buffer (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). After centrifugation, the supernatant containing the GST fusion protein was kept at −70 °C. An albino rabbit (Harlan Sprague-Dawley) and a mouse (BALB/c) were immunized with the GST-RX fusion protein emulsified with CFA (Life Technologies, Inc.) by subcutaneous injection in the back with 2 mg/0.5 ml and 0.5 mg/0.2 ml, respectively. Two and four weeks later booster injections of GST-RX emulsified with IFA (Life Technologies, Inc.) were given. Five weeks after the first injection the animals were euthanized and their serum collected. The anti-RX antibodies were purified on an immobilized protein-A agarose column following a Pierce instruction manual (Pierce, Rockford, IL). The eyes from adult Long-Evan's rats (body weight about 200 g) were immersed in fixative (4% paraformaldehyde in phosphate-buffered saline, pH 7.4) at 4 °C for 10 min. Then the eyes were cut and retinae were removed from the anterior segment, lens and vitreous body and kept in the fresh fixative at 4 °C for overnight. The tissues were embedded in paraffin and thin sections (5 μm) were obtained. These sections were treated with methanol for 30 min at −20 °C to increase membrane permeability, followed by 4% hydrogen peroxide treatment to block endogenous peroxidase activity. The sections were incubated overnight at 4 °C with a 1:500 dilution of mouse anti-RX polyclonal Ab alone or with the same antiserum which had been neutralized by preincubation with 200 μg of GST-RX protein at 4 °C for 24 h. The sections were then incubated with biotinylated goat anti-rabbit IgG antibody (Sigma). Color development was done with ExtrAvidin Peroxidase (Sigma) and 3-amino-9-ethylcarbazole (AEC substrate kit, Vector Laboratories, Burlingame, CA) according to the manufacturers' instructions. One gram each of bovine retina, lens, iris, mouse brain, and mouse liver were homogenized in RIPA buffer (1× phosphate-buffered saline, 1% Nonidet P-40, 0.5% sodium deoxycholate, 0.1% SDS) and centrifuged. After estimation of supernatant protein concentration with Bio-Rad Protein AssayTM (Bio-Rad), aliquots containing 60 μg of protein were dissolved in SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis sample buffer, separated on SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and blotted onto ImmunobilonTM (Millipore Corp., Bedford, MA) (17.Legendre N. BioTechniques. 1990; 9: 788-805PubMed Google Scholar). The filters were incubated overnight with rabbit RX Ab alone (1:1000 dilution) or with RX Ab which had been neutralized with GST-RX protein (see above). After washing, the blots were incubated with horseradish peroxidase-labeled secondary Abs (goat anti-rabbit IgG or goat anti-mouse IgG; 1:1000; Kirkegaard & Perry Laboratories, Inc., Gaithersburg, MD). The color was developed with 0.01% hydrogen peroxide and 0.05% 3,3-diaminobenzidine tetrahydrochloride (Bio-Rad). Protein size markers were purchased from Bio-Rad. Oligonucleotide probes listed in TableI were annealed and their 5′-ends were labeled with [γ-32P]ATP and T4polynucleotide kinase (Promega, Madison, WI). The standard binding reaction was carried out in 20 μl of a mixture containing 12 mm HEPES (pH 7.9), 12 mm KCl, 0.6 mm MgCl2, 1.2 mm dithiothreitol, 10% glycerol, 2 μg of poly(dI-dC), 5 fmol of the32P-labeled probe, and 8 ng to 1 μg of purified GST-RX fusion protein. In competition assays, 8 fmol to 1 pmol (1.6–200 fold molar excess) of the competitor DNA was added to the standard mixture. After incubation on ice for 30 min, the samples were loaded onto 5% polyacrylamide gels in 0.5 × Tris borate-EDTA (TBE) buffer, and electrophoresed at 10 V/cm for 2 to 3 h at room temperature. The gel was then dried and autoradiographed at −70 °C.Table IOligonucleotides used in EMSA Open table in a new tab For Ab supershift analysis, 1 μl of rabbit Ab to RX was added to the standard mixture halfway through the reaction (after the first 15 min of incubation). Nuclear extract from bovine retinas was prepared by the method of Gorski et al. (18.Gorski K. Carneriro M. Schibler U. Cell. 1986; 47: 767-776Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (973) Google Scholar). A construct containing the mouse arrestin promoter (−209 to +304)/chloramphenicol acetyltransferase (CAT) fusion gene (m-ARR-209-CAT) was prepared as described (10.Kikuchi T. Raji K. Breitman M.L. Shinohara T. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 4400-4408Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar). A construct containing the mouse IRBP promoter (−1783 to +101)/CAT fusion gene (m-IRBP-1983-CAT) was provided by John M. Nickerson (Emory University). CAT constructs containing PCE-1 sites or OTX sites upstream of the basal herpes simplex virus thymidine kinase (tk) promoter were generated by inserting double-stranded oligonucleotides into theBstXI site of pBLCAT5 (ATCC, Manassas, VA). Oligonucleotides containing either the PCE-1 or OTX element were chemically synthesized and annealed and ligated as described above. The elements were: PCE-1 CTAGAAAAGCTTTCAATTAGCTATTTTTTCGAAAGTTAATCGATAAGATC and OTX CTAGACTGCTGAGCTTAATCAGGCCTTGACGACTCGAATTAGTCCGGAGATC. Selected clones were sequenced and only clones having exactly two tandemly repeated PCE-1 or OTX elements in the correct orientation were chosen for further experiments. To confirm that RX binds to the PCE-1 site and activates the natural arrestin promoter, the PCE-1 site in the mouse arrestin promoter/CAT construct m-ARR-209-CAT was mutated. The m-ARR-209-CAT was cleaved withHindIII and EcoNI and the fragment was replaced with a double-stranded oligomer containing the mutated sequence as follows: AGCTTTCAACCAGCTATTCCTCTCTTTGCACCTTGAAGTTGGTCGATAAGGAGAGAAACGTGGAACG. The resulting construct was called m-ARR-209-PCE-1-mut-CAT. The mammalian expression plasmid pcDNA3 (Stratagene), bearing the human cytomegalovirus promoter-enhancer, was used to generate RX and CRX expression vectors for co-transfection studies. cDNA fragments containing the complete coding regions of human RX (EcoRI/EcoRI fragment) and human CRX (BamHI/XhoI fragment) were subcloned intoEcoRI-digested and BamHI- andXhoI-digested pcDNA3, respectively. Neuroretinal cells from day 14 embryonic chicken retinae were incubated in 0.25% trypsin at 37 °C for 20 min. Then 5 × 106 cells were cultured in Y-199 medium with 10% fetal calf serum, penicillin (100 units/ml), and streptomycin (100 μg/ml) at 37 °C in polyornithine-coated 60-mm tissue culture plates. Detailed procedures were described elsewhere (19.Boatright J.H. Buono R. Bruno J. Lang R.K. Si J.S. Shinohara T. Peoples J.W. Nickerson J.M. Exp. Eye Res. 1997; 64: 269-277Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). Human embryonic kidney cells (293 cells) were cultured for 1 to 2 days in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 10% fetal calf serum, then they were co-transfected by the calcium phosphate precipitation method with three constructs: (i) 0.04–5.0 μg of an RX or CRX expression vector, (ii) 10 μg of promoter/CAT reporter construct, and (iii) 5 μg of pSV-β-galactosidase vector. After a 48-h incubation, cells were harvested and extracts were assayed for CAT activity (20.Gorman C. Glover D.M. DNA Cloning. 2. IRL Press, Oxford1985: 143-190Google Scholar). All CAT values were normalized to β-galactosidase activity. The results presented represent the mean of at least three independent experiments. We isolated cDNAs for seven individual factors from a human retinal library by Southwestern screening with the PCE-1 probes (probe 1 and probe 2; see “Experimental Procedures”), and a clone which bound strongly to both probes was selected for further study. Sequencing revealed that the clone contained a region homologous to the highly conserved DNA binding consensus (homeobox) in homeodomain proteins. The full size of this clone was 1790 bp long and encoded a 346-amino acid protein, which we have named human RX (GenBank accession number AF115392). This protein shares 85% identity (Fig.1 A) with mouse RX (1.Mathers P.H. Grinberg A. Mahon K.A. Jamrich M. Nature. 1997; 387: 603-607Crossref PubMed Scopus (582) Google Scholar, 7.Furukawa T. Kozack C.A. Cepko C.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 3088-3093Crossref PubMed Scopus (310) Google Scholar) and 100% identity between 97 and 162 with the partial human RX sequence isolated by Mathers et al. (1.Mathers P.H. Grinberg A. Mahon K.A. Jamrich M. Nature. 1997; 387: 603-607Crossref PubMed Scopus (582) Google Scholar) (GenBank™ accession numberAF001911). The nucleotide sequence between 295 and 493 bp of the partial human hRx cDNA (1.Mathers P.H. Grinberg A. Mahon K.A. Jamrich M. Nature. 1997; 387: 603-607Crossref PubMed Scopus (582) Google Scholar) shares 96% homology with the 478 to 676-bp region of our hRx. The sequence between 1 and 294 bp of the partial human Rx cDNA (1.Mathers P.H. Grinberg A. Mahon K.A. Jamrich M. Nature. 1997; 387: 603-607Crossref PubMed Scopus (582) Google Scholar) shares 95% homology with a Int-1 sequence of our hRx-1 cDNA (see below). Thus, the human partial sequence of Rx published by the Mathers et al. (1.Mathers P.H. Grinberg A. Mahon K.A. Jamrich M. Nature. 1997; 387: 603-607Crossref PubMed Scopus (582) Google Scholar) is part of hRx-1 cDNA. Two additional clones similar to hRx (hRx-1 and hRx-2) were isolated from the same library by a DNA hybridization method using an hRx (cDNA) probe. Nucleotide sequence of hRx-1 (2,230 bp) and hRx-2 (1,846 bp) was identical in sequence to hRx except for a 303-bp insertion between bp 484/485 in hRx-1 and two insertions of 303 and 159 bp between bp 484/485 and bp 742/743, respectively, in hRx-2 (Fig. 1 B). We believe that these cDNAs might be products of alternative RNA splicing. A functional role of these two clones is presently unknown. It does, however, seem unlikely that these cDNA clones could encode a homeodomain-containing protein, since the first inserted sequence (Int-1) contains two in-frame stop codons upstream of the homeodomain, and the second insertion (Int-2) also contains two stop codons. We studied the expression pattern of RX in various tissues by immunoblot analysis. Specificity of the this procedure was demonstrated on duplicate immunoblots probed with the same RX-specific Abs (Fig.2 A) which had been preincubated with purified GST-RX (Fig. 2 B) or with preimmune serum (data not shown). Two predominant bands in the 37-kDa molecular mass region were detected in retina (Fig. 2 A), but only one of these was RX (Fig. 2 A, shown by anarrowhead) since this band could be eliminated by addition of GST-RX to anti-RX Ab (Fig. 2 B). This RX-specific band was also detected in iris (Fig. 2 A). The specificity of the RX Abs for GST-RX but not the related GST-CRX is shown in Fig.2 A. These results suggest that RX is present in neural retina and iris, but not detectable lens, brain, and liver. The expression pattern of RX in the retina was further investigated by immunohistochemistry using the affinity purified rabbit anti-RX Ab (1/500 dilution). This analysis revealed that RX was present in the outer nuclear layer (nucleus of photoreceptor cells), in addition, it was present in neuroretinal cells including ganglion cells and the inner nuclear layer (Fig. 3 A). In control experiments, RX Abs which had been preincubated with purified GST-RX failed to stain any of these cell types (Fig.3 B).Figure 3Immunohistochemistry. A, rat retinas were immunostained with RX-specific antibodies (1/500 dilution). B, retinas were immunostained with RX-specific antibodies (1/500 dilation) which had been preincubated with purified GST-RX (200 μg).

Double-stranded oligonucleotides containing the PCE-1 element of the mouse arrestin gene (10.Kikuchi T. Raji K. Breitman M.L. Shinohara T. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 4400-4408Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar) and the mouse OTX element (m-OTX) (see Refs. 2.Chen S. Wang Q.L. Nie Z. Sun H. Lennon G. Copeland N.G. Gillbert D.J. Jenkins N.A.

Fusion proteins of GST with RX (GST-RX) or with the human CRX (GST-CRX) were produced in an E. coli expression system and purified by glutathione column chromatography. Strong binding was observed when the m-PCE-1 element was incubated with the GST-RX protein at higher concentrations (Fig.4 A). In contrast, less strong binding of GST-CRX to m-PCE-1 was observed. Conversely, binding was observed between m-OTX and GST-RX only at higher concentrations, but stronger binding was observed between m-OTX and GST-CRX at those concentrations. In the control experiments, GST bound to neither the m-PCE-1 site nor the m-OTX site. Binding of RX to the m-PCE-1 element was decreased significantly by a 40-fold molar excesses of unlabeled m-PCE-1 competitor, but was only slightly diminished by a 200-fold molar excesses of unlabeled m-OTX competitor (Fig. 4 B). Complex formation between RX and PCE-1 sites was unaffected by a large excess of an unlabeled, unrelated oligonucleotide containing the chicken ovalbumin upstream promoter transcription factor (COUP-TF) site. Conversely, binding of CRX to m-OTX was inhibited slightly by a large molar excess of unlabeled m-PCE-1, and strongly by a large molar excess of unlabeled of m-OTX, but was unaffected by the COUP competitor. These results indicated that the stronger binding was between m-PCE-1 and RX and between m-OTX and CRX, and that the affinity of CRX for m-PCE-1 and the affinity of RX for m-OTX are much weaker. We have therefore concluded that PCE-1 and OTX are the binding sites for RX and CRX, respectively. We used an antibody (Ab) supershifting technique in combination with EMSA to confirm that the PCE-1 elements bind to RX contained in retina extracts. In a previous publication (10.Kikuchi T. Raji K. Breitman M.L. Shinohara T. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 4400-4408Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar), when m-PCE-1 was incubated with bovine retinal nuclear extract, EMSA revealed a complex designated Bp1 (see also Fig. 5, lane 1, indicated by an arrow). Initially we generated complexes between m-PCE-1 and bovine nuclear extract followed by addition of Abs (Fig. 5, lanes 1 and 3, an arrow and an open arrowhead, respectively). Similarly, we generated complexes between m-PCE-1 and purified RX, then added RX-specific Abs (Fig. 5, lanes 4 and 5, an arrowheadand an open arrowhead, respectively). The RX-specific Abs recognized both purified GST-RX and RX from bovine nuclear extracts bound in PCE-1 complexes. The complexes formed between m-PCE-1 and purified GST-RX were smaller than those formed with the nuclear extract, but both of these complexes were supershifted by RX-specific Abs (Fig. 5, lanes 3 and 5, open arrowheads, respectively). We therefore concluded that the Bp1 complexes formed between bovine retina nuclear extract and the m-PCE-1 element contained RX factor. As reported previously (10.Kikuchi T. Raji K. Breitman M.L. Shinohara T. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 4400-4408Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar), m-PCE-1 and a bovine nuclear factor generated a second complex, Bp2 (Fig. 5, arrow). Interestingly, the Bp2 complex failed to supershift upon addition of RX-specific Abs suggesting that it does not contain RX. We speculated that the Bp2 may be composed of m-PCE-1 element and other homeodomain proteins such as CRX (2.Chen S. Wang Q.L. Nie Z. Sun H. Lennon G. Copeland N.G. Gillbert D.J. Jenkins N.A.

Parasite Immunol. 1982; 4: 307-318Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar), andMesocestoides corti (4.Todd Jr., K.S. Simon J. Dipietro J.A. Lab. Anim. 1978; 12: 51-53Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar) form eosinophilic inflammatory lesions in host tissue at the site where they invade or lay their eggs. The mechanisms by which eosinophils are recruited to local inflammatory sites via the circulation have been elucidated at least in part using eosinophil chemotactic factors (ECFs)1 (5.Owhashi M. Kitagawa K. Horii Y. Ishii A. Curr. Topics Vet. Res. 1994; 1: 37-41Google Scholar). Increased eosinopoiesis in bone marrow is observed prior to the tissue eosinophilia in parasitic infections (6.Spry C.J.F. Cell Tissue Kinet. 1971; 4: 351-364PubMed Google Scholar, 7.Owhashi M. Maruyama H. Nawa Y. Int. J. Parasitol. 1996; 26: 705-711Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar). Indeed, most multipotent hemopoietic stem cells are located in bone marrow (8.Maruyama H. Higa A. Asami M. Owhashi M. Nawa Y. Exp. Hematol. 1991; 19: 77-80PubMed Google Scholar). On the other hand, kinetic studies suggest that the spleen is the site where eosinophils mature (9.Spry C.J.F. Cell Tissue Kinet. 1971; 4: 365-374PubMed Google Scholar), indicating eosinophil influx from the bone marrow to spleen at the maturation stage. Previous studies have shown that a splenocyte-derived ECF (ECF-L) is produced in an antigen-specific manner during the course of parasitic infections accompanying systemic and local eosinophilia (7.Owhashi M. Maruyama H. Nawa Y. Int. J. Parasitol. 1996; 26: 705-711Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar), and CD4−CD8+ T cells play an important role in ECF-L production (10.Owhashi M. Arita H. Niwa A. Parasitol. Res. 1998; 84: 136-138Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). Although ECF-L can be discriminated from other ECFs in terms of its physicochemical and immunochemical properties (11.Owhashi M. Nawa Y. Int. Arch. Allergy Immunol. 1987; 83: 290-295Crossref Scopus (4) Google Scholar), the molecular structure of ECF-L still remains unclear. To obtain further insight into the immunological functions of ECF-L at the molecular level, cloning of cDNA encoding ECF-L is needed. In this paper, we present the isolation of cDNA encoding ECF-L, the molecular expression of ECF-L, and a structure comparison of ECF-L with related proteins. The results clearly show that ECF-L is a novel eosinophil chemotactic cytokine that belongs to the chitinase protein family. Female C57BL/6 or ddY mice were obtained from Japan SLC (Hamamastu, Japan) and used at 8–10 weeks of age. They were infected intraperitoneally with 30 cercariae of S. japonicum (Japanese strain) or 100 tetrathyridiae of M. corti and were killed by cervical dislocation under ether anesthesia. Soluble egg antigen of S. japonicum was prepared as described previously (12.Owhashi M. Ishii A. J. Immunol. 1982; 129: 2226-2231PubMed Google Scholar). In short, the eggs were harvested from the intestines of S. japonicum-infected mice by enzymatic digestion using Pronase (Kaken, Tokyo, Japan) and collagenase (type I, Sigma Chemical Co., St. Louis, MO). Eggs were suspended in 5.8 mm phosphate-buffered saline (PBS, pH 7.4) and homogenized with a Teflon homogenizer in an ice-chilled water bath. The mixture was centrifuged at 100,000 × g for l h. The supernatant was used as S. japonicum egg antigen. Purification of a major 260-kDa antigen (J1) was performed as described previously (13.Owhashi M. Horii Y. Imai J. Ishii A. Nawa Y. Int. Arch. Allergy Immunol. 1986; 81: 129-135Crossref Scopus (3) Google Scholar). For preparation of soluble M. cortiantigen, tetrathyridiae of M. corti were homogenized with a Teflon homogenizer in an ice-chilled water bath and centrifuged at 100,000 × g for 30 min. The supernatant was used asM. corti antigen. For collection of eosinophil-rich peritoneal exudate cells, ddY mice were infected intraperitoneally with 100 larvae of M. corti. 3 weeks later, peritoneal lavage was harvested. The cells were washed twice with PBS and suspended in RPMI 1640 medium (Life Technologies, Inc., Grand Island, NY) containing 2% FBS (Life Technologies, Inc.). To remove adherent cells, the cell suspension was incubated in a tissue culture flask (Nunc) at 37 °C for 30 min. The nonadherent cells were used for eosinophil chemotaxis experiments. By this method, more than 1 × 107 eosinophils were collected from one mouse, and the purity of the eosinophils was 50–70%. Major contaminants were macrophages and neutrophils. Neutrophil-rich or macrophage-rich peritoneal exudate cells were obtained from normal ddY mice that received an intraperitoneal injection of 2 ml of 0.1% oyster glycogen (Nacalai Tesque, Kyoto, Japan) 2 h or 48 h before use, for neutrophils or macrophages, respectively. Neutrophil-rich (>90%) or macrophage-rich (40–50%) cell suspensions from three animals were pooled and used for the respective chemotaxis experiments. T lymphocytes for chemotaxis indicator cells were prepared as a T cell line. Female C57BL/6 mice were immunized with 20 μg of ovalbumin (Sigma) in complete Freund's adjuvant. 12 days later, the spleen was removed, ground to single cell suspensions, and washed twice with PBS. The splenocytes were cultured with 30 μg/ml OVA in RPMI 1640 containing 2% FBS. Blast cells were separated on a Ficoll (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) density gradient and then cultured without antigen for 7 days in RPMI 1640 containing 2% FBS and 5% rat growth factor (supernatant of rat splenocytes cultured with 1 μg/ml concanavalin A in RPMI 1640 containing 2% FBS for 2 days). The cells (5 × 105/ml) were restimulated with 10 μg/ml ovalbumin in the presence of 5 × 106/ml irradiated splenocytes. The blast cells were cultured in RPMI 1640 containing 2% FBS and 5% rat growth factor for 7 days. After washing twice with PBS, they were used for chemotaxis experiments. Chemotactic activities in vitrowere measured as described previously (10.Owhashi M. Arita H. Niwa A. Parasitol. Res. 1998; 84: 136-138Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar) with slight modifications. Briefly, multiwell microchemotaxis chambers (Neuro Probe, Bethesda, MD) were equipped with Millipore membrane filters (Millipore Co., Bedford, MA) with a pore size of 3 μm for eosinophil and neutrophil chemotaxis or 8 μm for macrophage and T lymphocyte chemotaxis. The number of indicator cells was adjusted to 1 × 106/ml with RPMI 1640 medium containing 2% heat-inactivated FBS. Incubation was performed at 37 °C for 1 h in neutrophil chemotaxis or for 2 h in eosinophil, macrophage, or T lymphocyte chemotaxis. The membranes were stained according to Litt's procedure (51.Litt M. Am. J. Pathol. 1963; 42: 529-549PubMed Google Scholar). The indicator cells that migrated into the membrane were counted from a fixed level from the upper surface down to the lower surface. The distance from the upper surface was selected as a value between 60 and 90 μm from the upper surface to achieve background counts of less than 20 cells/10 high power field at 400 x. The total number of migrated cells was counted in 10 randomly selected high power fields. The chemotaxis experiments were done in quadruplicate and repeated at least twice. RANTES (Pepro Tech, London, U. K.), GRO (Diaclone Research, Besamcom Cedex, France), or MCP-1 (R & D Systems, Minneapolis, MN) was used as chemotaxis positive control. Samples (25 μl) were injected intradermally on the back of ddY mice that had been injected with 100 tetrathyridiae of M. corti 3 weeks earlier. 2 h later, mice were sacrificed, and the injection sites were collected. The tissue samples were fixed in 10% formalin, embedded in paraffin, sectioned at 4 μm, and stained with hematoxylin and eosin. The spleen was removed from normal or S. japonicum-infected mice 8 weeks after infection and gently squashed between two frost-ended slides in cold Hanks' balanced salt solution. The cell suspensions were washed with Hanks' balanced salt solution and suspended in serum-free RPMI 1640. Culturing was carried out at 37 °C for 24 h in a 5% CO2 and air environment in the presence of purified egg antigen J1 (10 μg/ml). Conditioned medium was obtained by centrifugation at 1,200 × g for 10 min. The supernatant was sterilized by filtration through a 0.45-μm membrane filter (Millipore Co.) and stored at −30 °C until used. DE52 (Whatman, Springfield, UK) anion-exchange chromatography was carried out at 4 °C using a 2.5 × 60-cm column equilibrated with 0.016 m Tris-HCl buffer, pH 7.7. Elution was performed with a linear gradient of NaCl (0–0.3 m) in the Tris-HCl buffer at a flow rate of 10 ml/h, and 8.5-ml fractions were collected. Procion red-agarose (Life Technologies, Inc.) was packed in a column (1.2 × 6-cm) and was equilibrated with 0.016 m Tris-HCl buffer, pH 7.7. Samples were dialyzed against the same buffer and applied to the Procion red-agarose column. The column was first washed with 60 ml of starting buffer, and then elution was performed with a linear gradient of NaCl (0–1.5 m) in the Tris-HCl buffer at a flow rate of 10 ml/h, and 6-ml fractions were collected. A sample was concentrated to 0.5 ml and applied to a size exclusion HPLC column (G3000SW, 0.78 × 30-cm, Toso, Tokyo, Japan) equilibrated with PBS. Chromatography was performed at a flow rate of 1.0 ml/min, and fractions of 0.7 ml were collected. A sample was concentrated to 0.5 ml and applied to an Cosmosil 5C18 column (4.6 × 25-cm, Nacalai Tesque). Elution was performed with a linear gradient of 0–70% acetonitrile in 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid at 25 °C and a flow rate of 0.7 ml/min, and 0.7-ml fractions were collected. The amino acid sequence was determined by automated Edman degradation on a gas-phase protein microsequencer (ABI470A, Perkin-Elmer, Foster City, CA). Female Lewis rats were immunized twice at a monthly interval in both hind footpads with a total of 0.2 ml of a 1:1 emulsion of the purified ECF-L (10 μg) in PBS and H37Ra adjuvant (Difco Laboratories, Detroit, MI). 2 weeks after the second immunization, they were bled, and the serum was separated. Establishment of a monoclonal antibody (mAb) to ECF-L was carried out according to a method described previously (14.Kenigsberg R.L. Elliott P.J. Cuello A.C. J. Immunol. Methods. 1991; 136: 247-257Crossref PubMed Scopus (7) Google Scholar) with modifications. In short, female Lewis rats were immunized twice with the purified ECF-L (10 μg) emulsified in H37Ra adjuvant. The spleens were removed 2 weeks after the last immunization and were hybridized to Sp2/0. A clone (E3.1) was selected, and the mAb was purified from the culture supernatant of hybridomas by gel chromatography on Sephacryl S300 (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) for experimental use. The isotype of E3.1 was determined as IgM by a kit (Binding Site, Birmingham, U. K.). The total RNA of bone marrow cells was isolated by the guanidine isothiocyanate/CsCl2 method (15.Chirgwin J. Przybyla A. MacDonald R. Rutter W. Biochemistry. 1979; 18: 5294-5299Crossref PubMed Scopus (16652) Google Scholar). Poly(A)+ RNA was selected by two passages over oligo(dT)-cellulose (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). cDNA synthesis was performed using a cDNA synthesis kit (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). The cDNAs were cloned into the EcoRI site of λgt11 vector (Promega Biotec, Madison, WI). Viral DNA was then packaged in vitro by means of Gigapack (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA). Independent recombinant clones (2 × 105) were screened using 1,000 × diluted anti-ECF-L polyclonal antibody as an antibody probe. Clones reacting with the antibody were isolated from the cDNA library and subcloned into Bluescript SK− (Stratagene). Nested deletions were prepared by using a nested deletion kit (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). The sequences of suitable clones were determined by the dideoxy chain termination method using an automated DNA sequencer (ABI310, Perkin-Elmer). A BamHI site was created 6 bp upstream of the translation initiation codon and an EcoRI site 6 bp downstream of the stop codon to obtain a full-length cDNA by polymerase chain reaction, and the cDNA was digested with theBamHI and EcoRI. TheBamHI-EcoRI fragment was then ligated to pVL1393 (Invitrogen). The recombinant pVL construct was co-transfected intoSpodoptera frugiperda Sf21 insect cells with a modified Autographa californica nuclear polyhedrosis virus DNA (BaculoPlus, Pharmingen), and the resultant viral pool was collected 4 days later. Sf21 insect cells were cultured in Grace medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (Life Technologies, Inc.) at 27 °C. To produce recombinant proteins, Sf21 cells seeded at a density of 106cells/ml were infected with the recombinant virus. The cells were harvested 96 h after infection, washed with a solution of 0.15m NaCl in 0.02 m phosphate buffer, pH 7.4, homogenized in a Tris-HCl, pH 7.6, and centrifuged at 10,000 ×g for 20 min. Recombinant ECF-L was purified from the supernatant using DE52, Procion red-agarose, G3000SW, and5C18 columns following the same steps as for the purification of natural ECF-L from the culture supernatant of splenocytes. SDS-PAGE was performed on 10% polyacrylamide gel by using the discontinuous buffer system of Laemmli (16.Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (207529) Google Scholar) with prestained Rainbow protein molecular weight markers (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). Western blotting onto a nitrocellulose filter (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) was performed as described (17.Towbin H. Staehelin T. Gordon J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1979; 76: 4350-4354Crossref PubMed Scopus (44939) Google Scholar). Blots were immunostained with 1,000 × diluted anti-ECF-L antiserum and 2,000 × diluted alkaline phosphatase-labeled goat anti-rat IgG (EY Laboratories, San Mateo, CA). Antibodies were detected with substrate containing 0.05 mg/ml 5-bromo-4-chloro-3-indolyl phosphate, 0.1 mg/ml nitro blue tetrazolium, and 4 mmMgCl2 in 100 mm Tris-HCl, pH 9.6. Total RNA from each organ was isolated using Isogen (Nippon Gene, Tokyo, Japan) from female C57BL/6 mice infected with 100 tetrathyridiae of M. corti 2 weeks earlier. 10 μg of total RNA from each organ was electrophoresed in 1% formaldehyde-agarose gel in MOPS and transferred onto a Hybond-N membrane (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). After prehybridization for 3 h in 50% formamide, 5 × Denhardt's solution, and 100 μg/ml denatured salmon sperm DNA at 65 °C, blots were hybridized with random primed 32P-labeled probes for 16 h under identical conditions. Filters were washed three times with 1 × SSC containing 0.1% SDS at 65 °C and then exposed to x-ray film (BioMax, Eastman Kodak, Rochester, New York). 32P-Labeled polymerase chain reaction fragments of ECF-L and mouse glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate-dehydrogenase cDNAs were used for probes. Chitinase activity was measured by a chromogenic assay using 200 mm p-nitrophenyl β-d-N,N′,N“-triacetylchitotriose (Sigma) in 0.05 m phosphate buffer, pH 6.8, as the substrate. Chitinase from Serratia marcescens (Sigma) was used as a positive control. Chitin bead (Life Technologies, Inc.) chromatography (1.0 × 3.3-cm column) was performed with PBS at a flow rate of 3.0 ml/h, and 0.6-ml fractions were collected. For purification of ECF-L protein, the medium conditioned by spleen cells obtained from S. japonicum-infected mice was concentrated, dialyzed against Tris-HCl buffer, and applied to a DE52 anion-exchange column. ECF activity was eluted at around the 0.15 m NaCl region of the gradient (Fig. 1 A). Active fractions were pooled, concentrated by ultrafiltration, dialyzed against Tris-HCl buffer, and then applied to the Procion red-agarose affinity column. Elution profiles are shown in Fig. 1 B. The major ECF activity was eluted at around 0.5 m NaCl. ECF-positive fractions were pooled, concentrated, and chromatographed by G3000SW HPLC (Fig. 1 C). ECF-positive fractions were pooled and purified further on a reverse phase HPLC column (Fig.1 D). A single absorbance peak at 230 nm coincided with the peak of ECF activity. The purified ECF-L showed homogeneity on SDS-PAGE analysis (Fig. 1 E) with a molecular mass of 43-kDa, and the specific eosinophil chemotactic activity was approximately 100 times that of the crude supernatant (Fig. 1 F). The cDNA library of bone marrow of mice was screened with an anti-ECF-L polyclonal antibody or mAb E3.1b. Of approximately 1,000,000 plaques screened, one plaque was found to be positive. The positive clone was picked and purified through three successive rounds of replating antibody screening. The insert was purified and subcloned into Bluescript SK−. As shown in Fig. 2, sequence analysis revealed that the cDNA was 1,506 bp long with a 1,197-bp open reading frame that could encode a protein 397 amino acids long. The putative amino acid sequence included the NH2-terminal 21-amino acid endoplasmic reticulum signal peptide followed immediately by the NH2-terminal sequence of natural ECF-L as determined by a protein microsequencer (YQLMXYYTSWAKDRPIEG). The molecular mass of mature ECF-L, calculated from the deduced amino acid sequence, was 42,370 Da. This value is close to the one determined experimentally by SDS-PAGE (Fig. 1 E). The calculated isoelectric point (pI 5.3) was somewhat higher than that determined experimentally (pI 3.6) by isoelectric focusing (11.Owhashi M. Nawa Y. Int. Arch. Allergy Immunol. 1987; 83: 290-295Crossref Scopus (4) Google Scholar). The sequence does not contain any consensus N-linked glycosylation sites (NXS, NXT) (18.Hart G.W. Brew K. Grant G.A. Brandshaw R.A. Lennarz W.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1979; 254: 9747-9753Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In addition, the mRNA contains an approximately 300-bp-long untranslated region with a polyadenylation signal (AAUAAA) toward the 3′-end. Recombinant ECF-L was prepared by a baculovirus expression system and purified by a combination of anion-exchange chromatography on DE52, affinity chromatography on Procion red-agarose, gel chromatography on G3000SW, and reverse phase HPLC. The purified recombinant protein showed a single band on SDS-PAGE analysis with a molecular mass of 43 kDa (data not shown). The ECF activity of the recombinant ECF-L was comparable with that of the natural ECF-L (Fig.3 A) and was completely inhibited by mAb to ECF-L (E3.1b) as well as natural ECF-L (Fig.3 B). We next examined the cellular specificity of ECF-L as a chemoattractant. Because the optimum chemotactic activity of RANTES, GRO, and MCP-1 was achieved at 10-8m in our assay system, the same molar concentration of ECF-L was employed for the comparative chemotaxis assays. As shown in Fig.4, both natural and recombinant ECF-L exhibited chemotactic activity for T lymphocytes and bone marrow cells as well as for eosinophils. Most of the migrated bone marrow cells in the membrane showed PMN-like features with segmented nuclei. In contrast, ECF-L exhibited a limited chemotactic activity for mature neutrophils and no detectable chemotactic activity for macrophages. This cellular specificity of ECF-L was similar to that of RANTES. On the other hand, GRO showed chemotactic activity for mature neutrophils but not for bone marrow cells. mAb to ECF-L (ECF-3) could inhibit most of the chemotactic activity of ECF-L for eosinophils, T lymphocytes, and bone marrow cells but not the chemotactic activities of RANTES, GRO, or MCP-1. To examine whether ECF-L could induce eosinophils to extravasate into the inflammatory site, recombinant ECF-L was injected intradermally on the back of mice infected with M. corti. As shown in Fig.5, large numbers of permeated eosinophils were observed at the site where ECF-L was injected. 90 ± 7% of the migrated leukocytes outside the blood vessel were eosinophilic when 29 ± 4% of all leukocytes in the blood were eosinophils in the treated mice. The number of migrated eosinophils increased dose-dependently with ECF-L. The increase in eosinophil migration was observed at as low as 5 × 10−8m (1 pmol). Kinetics of the ECF-L production by splenocytes were examined in M. corti-infected mice. As shown in Fig.6 A, production of eosinophil chemotactic activity by splenocytes was detectable as early as 2 weeks postinfection by Western blot analysis in an antigen-specific manner and increased with time. The amount of ECF-L detected was correlated with the eosinophil chemotactic activity of the culture supernatant of splenocytes (Fig. 6 B). When the ECF-L mRNA expression of each organ was examined at 2 weeks after M. corti infection, high level mRNA expression was detected in spleen, bone marrow, lung, and heart (Fig. 6 C). Lower levels of mRNA were also detected in liver, thymus, and small intestine. A message for ECF-L was generally undetectable in normal mice by Northern blot analysis, whereas a low level of mRNA was detected by reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction in bone marrow, spleen, and thymus in normal mice (data not shown). Nucleotide sequences of the reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction products (1–1,195) from the liver, spleen, and bone marrow mRNA of ddY mouse were identical to the sequence of the isolated cDNA clone from the library (Fig. 2). A comprehensive search of GenBank or EMBL nucleic acid data bases revealed that ECF-L possesses significant homology with prokaryotic chitinases, class III plant chitinases, fungus chitinase, insect and nematode chitinase, and chitinase family proteins distributed in vertebrate animals. An optimal alignment of 20 representative chitinases or chitinase family proteins was performed using the multiple sequence alignment program, Clustal X. 49 residues are highly conserved in more than 80% of the 20 representative chitinase family proteins, and 13 residues are completely conserved in all chitinase family proteins including ECF-L (Fig. 2). ECF-L retains 44 residues (90%) out of the 49 highly conserved. Fig. 7 shows an alignment of a conservative region where the catalytic center of the chitinases is located (19.Watanabe T. Kobori K. Miyashita K. Fujii T. Sakai H. Uchida M. Tanaka H. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 18567-18572Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Aspartic acid, essential for catalytic activity (19.Watanabe T. Kobori K. Miyashita K. Fujii T. Sakai H. Uchida M. Tanaka H. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 18567-18572Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), is conserved in all of the chitinases and chitinase family proteins other than ECF-L. Although the other essential acid for catalytic activity (19.Watanabe T. Kobori K. Miyashita K. Fujii T. Sakai H. Uchida M. Tanaka H. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 18567-18572Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), glutamic acid, is conserved in all of the chitinases, it is generally replaced by leucine or isoleucine in chitinase family proteins that have no chitinolytic activity (20.Hakala B.E.

In ECF-L, both the glutamic acid and the aspartic acid are replaced, by glutamine and asparagine, respectively. ECF-L possesses the CXC consensus sequence near the NH2 terminus which is typical of CXC chemokines. However, for ECF-L with CC chemokines or CXC chemokines (Fig. 8) poor alignments including for second and third cysteine residues were obtained. We could not detect any chitinase activity in purified ECF-L at any concentration up to 0.5 mg/ml. On the other hand, natural ECF-L eluted far behind (162%) the bed volume of the chitin column, whereas bovine serum albumin or other unrelated proteins eluted at 47% of the bed volume. In this paper, we described the purification, cDNA cloning, and molecular characterization of a novel eosinophil chemotactic cytokine, ECF-L, which is produced in parasitic infections upon stimulation of specific antigens. Comparisons of the inferred protein sequence against all of the sequences in the GenBank or EMBL data base revealed a high degree of similarity to chitinase belonging to family 18 of glycosyl hydrolases (26.Henrissat B. Bairoch A. Biochem. J. 1993; 293: 781-788Crossref PubMed Scopus (1778) Google Scholar) and vertebrate chitinase family proteins without chitinase activity (20.Hakala B.E. White C. Recklies A.D. J.

The covalent lipid modifications, myristoylation and palmitoylation, are critical for plasma membrane localization of heterotrimeric G protein α subunits. For αs and αq, two subunits that are palmitoylated but not myristoylated, we examined the importance of interacting with the G protein βγ dimer for their proper plasma membrane localization and palmitoylation. Conserved α subunit N-terminal amino acids predicted to mediate binding to βγ were mutated to create a series of βγ binding region mutants expressed in HEK293 cells. These αs and αq mutants were found in soluble rather than particulate fractions, and they no longer localized to plasma membranes as demonstrated by immunofluorescence microscopy. The mutations also inhibited incorporation of radiolabeled palmitate into the proteins and abrogated their signaling ability. Additional αq mutants, which contain these mutations but are modified by both myristate and palmitate, retained their localization to plasma membranes and ability to undergo palmitoylation. These findings identify binding to βγ as a critical membrane attachment signal for αs and αq and as a prerequisite for their palmitoylation, while myristoylation can restore membrane localization and palmitoylation of βγ binding-deficient αq subunits.

Upon receptor activation, the heterotrimer dissociates into a GTP-bound α subunit and a βγ subunit, both of which can regulate effector proteins. The correct targeting of G proteins to the plasma membrane, and likely micro-domains of the plasma membrane, is required for the proper functioning of this signaling system (3.Neubig R.R. FASEB J. 1994; 8: 939-946Crossref PubMed Scopus (319) Google Scholar). For example, α subunits defective in membrane binding are unable to couple receptor stimulation to effector activation (4.Morales J. Fishburn C.S. Wilson P.T. Bourne H.R. Mol. Biol.

Although the importance of membrane localization for proper signaling has been established, the basic signals that direct the different α subunits to the plasma membrane and retain them there are not well defined. A recent model proposes that G protein α subunits, and other peripheral membrane proteins, utilize two signals to bind tightly and stably to plasma membranes (7.McLaughlin S. Aderem A. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1995; 20: 272-280Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (619) Google Scholar, 8.Shahinian S. Silvius J.R.

These two signals are thought to act synergistically to promote a stable interaction between the membrane and G protein α subunit. According to the model, at least one of these signals must be involved in specifically targeting the α subunit to the plasma membrane rather than other intracellular membranes. The signals involved in targeting and binding to the membrane could be covalent lipid modifications, polybasic stretches of amino acids, or protein-protein interactions with other membrane-binding proteins (7.McLaughlin S. Aderem A. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1995; 20: 272-280Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (619) Google Scholar, 8.Shahinian S. Silvius J.R.

Lipid modifications clearly function as membrane binding signals for G protein α subunits (11.Dunphy J.T. Linder M.E. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1998; 1436: 245-261Crossref PubMed Scopus (317) Google Scholar, 12.Wedegaertner P.B. Biol. Signals Receptors. 1998; 7: 125-135Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). αi, αo, and αz contain two lipid modifications, myristoylation and palmitoylation, at their N terminus that are involved in membrane binding. Myristate, a 14-carbon fatty acid, is attached co-translationally via a stable amide bond to the N-terminal glycine residue after removal of the initiating methionine, while palmitate, a 16-carbon fatty acid, is attached post-translationally via a reversible thioester bond to a cysteine residue immediately C-terminal to the myristoylated glycine. Mutation of the N-terminal glycine abolishes myristoylation and inhibits palmitoylation, leading to a shift in localization from membrane to cytosol (13.Wilson P.T. Bourne H.R. J. Biol.

These results support a two-signal model of membrane binding in which myristoylation and palmitoylation cooperate in targeting α subunits of the αi family to the plasma membrane. Furthermore, myristoylation is required for subsequent palmitoylation. Many G protein α subunits (e.g. αs, αq, α12, α13), however, are not myristoylated, but are palmitoylated at N-terminal cysteines. The location of the cysteines and the surrounding sequences show little or no similarity among the different non-myristoylated α subunits. Although mutation of the palmitoylated cysteines inhibits membrane binding (5.Wedegaertner P.B. Chu D.H. Wilson P.T. Levis M.J. Bourne H.R. J. Biol.

Gilman A.G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 6116-6120Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar) have been proposed, although not yet tested, to function as membrane binding signals for the non-myristoylated α subunits. The importance of βγ subunits in helping to anchor α subunits to cellular (plasma) membranes is controversial. An early study showed that purified βγ was required to attach purified αi and αo to phospholipid vesicles in vitro (24.Sternweis P.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 631-637Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), and co-expression of βγ enhances membrane association of G2A myristoylation site mutants of αi or αz (4.Morales J. Fishburn C.S.

On the other hand, short N-terminal sequences of 10 amino acids or less from Gpa1 (a G protein α subunit fromSaccharomyces cerevisiae) (25.Gillen K.M. Pausch M. Dohlman H.G. J.

Cell. 1997; 8: 1159-1173Crossref PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar) are sufficient to target heterologous proteins to plasma membranes in the absence of interactions with βγ. Another recent report suggested that dissociation of αs from βγ combined with depalmitoylation of αs was not sufficient to release αs from isolated membranes, implying that neither palmitoylation nor βγ interactions were important for stable membrane association (28.Huang C. Duncan J.A. Gilman A.G. Mumby S.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 412-417Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). The goal of the studies presented here was to test the importance of βγ binding for two different non-myristoylated G protein α subunits. A series of mutations designed to disrupt βγ binding were introduced into αs and αq, and the localization of these subunits was determined by cell fractionation and immunofluorescence microscopy after transient transfection. In addition, palmitoylation of mutant αs and αq subunits was assayed by metabolic labeling. To test the possibility that myristoylation could substitute for βγ binding, an additional series of αq mutants containing an N-terminal site for myristoylation were created and assayed. The results of these experiments provide the first evidence that interactions with βγ are crucial for the proper membrane localization and palmitoylation of αs and αq. HEK293 cells were obtained from the American Type Culture Collection (CRL-1573). [2-3H]Inositol and [2-3H]adenine were from Amersham Pharmacia Biotech. [9,10-3H]Palmitic acid and [9,10-3H]myristic acid were from NEN Life Science Products. Dowex resin was from Bio-Rad. Tissue culture reagents were from Life Technologies, Inc. Other reagents were from Fisher Scientific and Sigma. The HA epitope (DVPDYA)-tagged HA- αs-pcDNAI and HA-αq-pcDNAI were constructed and analyzed previously and described in detail (5.Wedegaertner P.B. Chu D.H. Wilson P.T. Levis M.J. Bourne H.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 25001-25008Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar,29.Levis M.J. Bourne H.R. J. Cell Biol. 1992; 119: 1297-1307Crossref PubMed Scopus (182) Google Scholar). The coding region was transferred from these pcDNAI plasmids to pcDNA3 plasmids by restriction and ligation and the subsequent constructs are hereafter referred to as αs or αq. The Stratagene QuikChange site-directed mutagenesis kit was used to replace residues thought to contact βγ with alanines. The primers used for mutagenesis varied from 42 to 53 bases in length and the sense and antisense primers had 3′ overhangs of 3 to 7 bases. αqAG was created in the same manner using sense (5′-ctcggatccatcgatctggagtccatcatgggatgctgcctg-3′) and antisense (5′-gcagcatcccatgatggactccagatcgatggatccgagctc-3′) oligonucleotides, which replaced Ala with Gly after the second N-terminal methionine and prevented initiation from the first methionine by replacing the first putative methionine codon six residues upstream of the second with an isoleucine codon. To create all the αqAG βγ binding mutants, the 889-base pair EcoNI and EcoRI fragment from each of the βγ binding mutants of αq was ligated into αqAG plasmid cut withEcoNI and EcoRI. The resulting cDNAs were verified by DNA sequencing (Kimmel Cancer Center Nucleic Acids Facility) to contain no mutations other than those desired. The R201C and R183C mutants were created by excisingEco47III-XhoI andEco47III-NotI fragments from HA-αs-R201C-pcDNAI and HA-αq-R183C-pcDNAI (5.Wedegaertner P.B. Chu D.H. Wilson P.T. Levis M.J. Bourne H.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 25001-25008Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), respectively, and ligating them into appropriately digested αs- or αq-pcDNA3 plasmids. HEK293 cells were propagated in Dulbecco's minimal essential medium containing 10% fetal bovine serum and Gentamicin. Unless otherwise noted, cells were plated in six-well plates at 7.0 × 105 cells/well and grown for 24 h prior to transfection. 1 μg of each expression plasmid was transfected into the cells using LipofectAMINE from Life Technologies, Inc. according to the manufacturer's instructions. HEK293 cells were plated at 2 × 106 cells in 6-cm plates, grown for 24 h, and transfected with 3 μg of expression plasmid. 24 h after transfection, the cells were transferred to 10-cm plates and grown for 48 h. Cells were washed once with phosphate-buffered saline and then dislodged from the plate by washing and pelleted at low speed. The cell pellet was suspended in 0.5 ml of lysis buffer (50 mmTris-HCl, pH 8, 2.5 mm MgCl2, 1 mmEDTA, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 0.5 mmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 5 μg/ml leupeptin, 5 μg/ml aprotinin), and cells were lysed by 10 passages through a 27-gauge needle. Lysed cells were centrifuged at 400 × g for 5 min to remove nuclei and intact cells. The supernatant was centrifuged at 150,000 × g for 20 min at 4 °C in a TL-100 tabletop ultracentrifuge (Beckman Instruments). The supernatant (soluble fraction) was removed and the pellet (particulate fraction) was suspended in an equal volume of lysis buffer. Fractions were frozen at −20 °C and later analyzed by Western blotting. Samples were fractionated by 10% SDS-PAGE, transferred to PVDF-Plus (Micron Separations Inc.) using a Trans-Blot SD semi-dry electrophoretic transfer cell (Bio-Rad), and probed with 12CA5 monoclonal antibody. Bands were visualized by chemiluminescence and quantitated using a Kodak DC40 imaging system. 24 h after transfection in six-well plates, HEK293 cells were replated on glass coverslips and grown for 48 h. Cells were fixed with 3.7% formaldehyde in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) for 15 min and permeabilized by incubation in blocking buffer (2.5% nonfat milk and 1% Triton X-100 in PBS) for 30 min. Cells were then incubated with 12CA5 mouse monoclonal antibody (3 μg/ml) in blocking buffer for 1 h. The cells were washed with blocking buffer and incubated in a 1:100 dilution of donkey anti-mouse Texas Red conjugate (Jackson Immunoresearch Laboratories, West Grove, PA) for 30 min. The coverslips were washed with 1% Triton X-100 in PBS, rinsed in distilled water, and mounted on glass slides with 10 μl of Prolong Antifade reagent (Molecular Probes, Eugene, OR). Microscopy was performed with an Olympus BX60 microscope equipped with a 60×/NA1.4 objective and a Texas Red filter cube. Images were recorded with a Sony DKC-5000 digital camera and transferred to Adobe Photoshop for digital processing. 24 h after transfection in six-well plates, each well was reseeded into six wells of a 24-well plate with [2-3H]adenine or [2-3H]inositol (2 μCi/ml) and grown for 24 h. The cells were then assayed for their ability to induce production of cAMP or IP as described previously (5.Wedegaertner P.B. Chu D.H. Wilson P.T. Levis M.J. Bourne H.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 25001-25008Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The βγ binding competition assay was performed in the same manner as the cAMP assay except that cells were stimulated with 10 μm quinpirole rather than UK-14304, as described (30.Federman A.D. Conklin B.R. Schrader K.A. Reed R.R. Bourne H.R. Nature. 1992; 356: 159-161Crossref PubMed Scopus (481) Google Scholar). Radiolabeling of αs and αq with fatty acids was performed essentially as described (31.Wedegaertner P.B. Manning D.R. G Proteins:Techniques of Analysis. CRC Press, Boca Raton, FL1999: 153-171Google Scholar). 48 h after transfection, HEK293 cells in a 6-cm dish were incubated with 1 ml of Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 10% fetal bovine serum, 5 mmsodium pyruvate, and [9,10-3H]palmitic acid (1 mCi/ml) or [9,10-3H]myristate (0.25 mCi/ml) for 2 h. Cells were washed once with PBS and lysed in 1 ml of radioimmune precipitation buffer (50 mm HEPES, pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl, 0.5% sodium deoxycholate, 1% Nonidet P-40, 1 mm EDTA, 2.5 mm MgCl2, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 2 μg/ml leupeptin, 2 μg/ml aprotinin). Cell extracts were tumbled for 1 h at 4 °C, and nuclei and insoluble material were removed by microcentrifugation at 16,000 × g for 3 min. Samples containing HA-tagged αq or its mutants were adjusted to 0.1% SDS. 1 μg of 12CA5 antibody was added, and the samples were tumbled for 2 h at 4 °C. Next, 20 μl of Protein A/G Plus agarose (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Santa Cruz, CA) was added, and the sample was tumbled overnight at 4 °C. The sample was centrifuged for 30 s at 200 × g to pellet the beads. The supernatant was discarded, and the beads were washed three times with 1 ml of radioimmune precipitation buffer. SDS-PAGE sample buffer containing 10 mm dithiothreitol was added to the washed beads, and the samples were heated at 65 °C for 1 min. An aliquot was analyzed by 10% SDS-PAGE. Gels were incubated for 20 min in an aqueous solution of 50% methanol and 10% acetic acid, followed by 10% ethanol and 10% acetic acid for 20 min, and, finally, Amplify (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) for 20 min. Gels were dried and subjected to fluorography at −80 °C using Hyperfilm MP (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). HEK293 cells were transiently transfected with expression constructs, and soluble and particulate fractions were isolated as already described. The particulate (membrane) fractions were centrifuged at 20,000 rpm for 35 min at 4 °C in a TL-100 tabletop ultracentrifuge (Beckman Instruments). The pellet was resuspended in 100 μl of solubilization buffer (20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 100 mm NaCl, 2 mm MgCl2, 0.1 mm EDTA, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 10% glycerol, 1% C12E10 (polyoxyethylene 10-lauryl ether), 0.1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride) and incubated on ice for 30 min followed by centrifugation at 150,000 × g for 20 min at 4 °C. The supernatant was divided into separate tubes and incubated for 30 min at 30 °C with 10 μm GDP or AlF4− mix (30 mm NaF, 150 μm AlCl3, 10 μm GDP) (32.Garcia P.D. Onrust R. Bell S.M. Sakmar T.P. Bourne H.R. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 4460-4469Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar). Samples were then treated with a 1:500 dilution of trypsin mix (100 μm GDP, 0.6 mg/ml trypsin, 1% C12E10) and further incubated for 30 min at 30 °C. Reactions were terminated by adding soybean trypsin inhibitor to a final concentration of 3 mg/ml. Trypsin-resistant fragments of αq were visualized by SDS-PAGE and Western blot analysis using 12CA5 antibody as described previously. Examination of the extreme N terminus of several G protein α subunits reveals two conserved regions with a (I/L)(E/D)(K/R) triplet within the second region (Fig.1). X-ray crystallography of the αβγ complex for Gt and Gi1 has shown that this second region contains residues that directly contact βγ (33.Wall M.A. Coleman D.E. Lee E. Iniguez-Lluhi J.A. Posner B.A. Gilman A.G. Sprang S.R. Cell. 1995; 83: 1047-1058Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1018) Google Scholar,34.Lambright D.G. Sondek J. Bohm A. Skiba N.P. Hamm H.E. Sigler P.B. Nature. 1996; 379: 311-319Crossref PubMed Scopus (1055) Google Scholar). All of the conserved residues in this region, with the exception of (K/R), were shown to contact βγ. In order to assess the importance of βγ binding for proper localization and palmitoylation, we substituted alanine residues for these potentially important amino acids in αs and αq. 3The original report describing the cDNA sequence of murine αq (66.Strathmann M. Simon M.I. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 9113-9117Crossref PubMed Scopus (388) Google Scholar) identified histidine and valine (HV) at positions 28 and 29, respectively, rather than glutamine and leucine (QL) (Fig. 1). Our sequencing results of the cDNA from the same original source identifies glutamine and leucine at positions 28 and 29, respectively. A single gc reversal in the original DNA sequencing would have coded for HV rather than QL. This difference is not trivial since leucines in αi1 and αt at positions identical to αq residue 29 contact βγ. Alignment of G protein α sequences (34.Lambright D.G. Sondek J. Bohm A. Skiba N.P. Hamm H.E. Sigler P.B. Nature. 1996; 379: 311-319Crossref PubMed Scopus (1055) Google Scholar) indicates that other α subunits, including Gpa1 from S. cerevisiae, have leucine at this critical position. In addition, protein data base searches reveal that leucine has been reported at this position in αq homologs from all species, including Drosophila melanogaster and Homo sapiens. Although (K/R) does not seem to contact βγ, this highly conserved residue was also mutated in some constructs to examine its role in localization and palmitoylation of αs and αq. Interestingly, mutation of the lysine at this position in αo caused a reduction in βγ binding, as measured by pertussis toxin-catalyzed ADP-ribosylation (35.Slepak V.Z. Wilkie T.M. Simon M.I. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 1414-1423Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Constructs with progressively greater mutations were made beginning within the conserved triplet and working outward as shown in Fig. 1. Although a second surface of the α subunit forms an even larger area of interaction with βγ (33.Wall M.A. Coleman D.E. Lee E. Iniguez-Lluhi J.A. Posner B.A. Gilman A.G. Sprang S.R.

First, previous work by others showed that disruption of this region by deletion (36.Graf R. Mattera R. Codina J. Estes M.K. Birnbaumer L. J. Biol.

Second, mutations in the N-terminal region are unlikely to disrupt the overall three-dimensional structure of the α subunit. Crystal structures indicate that this region does not interact with other regions of α, whereas the second βγ contact surface is located within the switch I and II region where activation-dependent rearrangements occur (33.Wall M.A. Coleman D.E.

To facilitate immunodetection and immunoprecipitation of the α subunits, we utilized well characterized HA-tagged variants of αs and αq. To determine whether this putative βγ binding region of αs and αq is critical for membrane attachment, we transiently transfected the various α subunit constructs into HEK293 cells and determined their subcellular distributions. The transfected cells were lysed in hypotonic buffer, soluble (S) and particulate (P) fractions were separated by centrifugation and the distribution of α subunits was assessed by Western blot analysis. In these experiments the distribution of wild-type HA-tagged αs is reproducibly 60:40 P:S. As the putative βγ binding region of αs is subjected to increasing numbers of mutations, the membrane-bound fraction progressively decreases until construct αsIEK+ partitions 20:80 P:S (Fig. 2). Inclusion of the arginine 201 to cysteine (RC) (45.Landis C.A. Masters S.B. Spada A. Pace A.M. Bourne H.R. Vallar L. Nature. 1989; 340: 692-696Crossref PubMed Scopus (1237) Google Scholar) activating mutation further increases the soluble fraction to give a 10:90 P:S ratio for αsRC IEK+. The same mutations were also assayed in the αq subunit which showed the same trend toward greater solubility. αq without mutations was almost entirely membrane associated (85:15 P:S) while αqIER+ was found almost exclusively in the soluble fraction (15:85 P:S) (Fig. 2). The subcellular distribution of these two subunits varied only slightly between experiments. In agreement with the αs data, the other αq mutants were always found in the soluble fractions to a greater degree than was wild type αq; however, they displayed greater variability between experiments (data not shown). To examine further the effect of βγ binding region mutations on αs and αq localization, immunofluorescence microscopy was utilized to examine the subcellular distribution of the HA epitope-tagged αs and αq subunits in transiently transfected HEK293 cells. Wild-type αsdisplayed pronounced plasma membrane staining, as evidenced by the sharp signal at the cell periphery, with some diffuse staining of the cytoplasm (Fig. 3 A). Mutations in the βγ binding region caused a decrease in plasma membrane staining and a concomitant increase in cytoplasmic staining (Fig. 3,B–F). Complete loss of plasma membrane staining was only observed for αsIEK+. All other mutant subunits displayed an intermediate level of plasma membrane and cytoplasmic staining in which the level of cytoplasmic staining increased as the number of mutations increased. The αq subunit was much more sensitive to loss of plasma membrane staining in visualized cells. A"

To understand further the role of these CaRs, we analyzed the structure of mouse CaRs, and investigated their role using a mouse model in which only the full-length CaR was disrupted. Our results show that both the full-length and the alternatively spliced variant lacking exon 5 encoding 77 amino acids of the extracellular domain were expressed in mouse epidermis. The deletion of the full-length CaR increased the production of the alternatively spliced form of CaR in mutant mice. The keratinocytes derived from these mutant mice did not respond to extracellular calcium, suggesting that the full-length CaR is required to mediate calcium signaling in the keratinocytes. The loss of the full-length CaR altered the morphologic appearance of the epidermis and resulted in a reduction of the mRNA and protein levels of the keratinocyte differentiation marker, loricrin. These results indicate that CaR is important in epidermal differentiation, and that the alternatively spliced form does not fully compensate for loss of the full-length CaR.

Furthermore, the gradient of calcium within the epidermis, with highest levels in the stratum granulosum and lowest levels in the stratum basale, suggests that calcium is important in epidermal differentiation in vivo (8.Menon G.

We identified the calcium sensing receptor (CaR) in human keratinocytes as a candidate molecule, which mediates calcium signaling during terminal keratinocyte differentiation (10.Bikle D.D. Ratman A.

Chem. 1998; 273: 23344-23352Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar). This receptor is a member of the superfamily of G protein-coupled membrane receptors through which signaling occurs via phospholipase C activation, with subsequent inositol triphosphate (IP3) production and intracellular calcium ([Ca2+]i) release (12.Chattopadhyay N. Mithal A. Brown E. Endocr. Rev. 1996; 17: 289-307PubMed Google Scholar, 13.Hebert S. Brown E. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1995; 7: 484-492Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). In addition, we found that keratinocytes express an alternatively spliced form of CaR lacking exon 5. This spliced variant is unable to mediate the acute response to [Ca2+]o to produce IP3. The transcript of the full-length CaR is predominantly expressed in undifferentiated keratinocytes, and its levels decrease as the cells differentiate, whereas the transcript of the spliced variant is expressed throughout the differentiation process. These molecular changes are consistent with the decrease of [Ca2+]i and IP3response to [Ca2+]o during differentiation. These results suggest a role for full-length CaR in human keratinocyte differentiation that is not filled by the alternatively spliced form (11.Oda Y. Tu C.-L. Pillai S. Bikle D.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 23344-23352Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar). Here, we investigated the expression of CaR in mouse epidermis. The complete nucleotide sequence of mouse CaR cDNA was determined. The function of the CaR was analyzed using a mouse model in which the CaR gene was disrupted. To our initial surprise, mutant mice continued to express CaR. However, we then determined that the mouse epidermis, like the human keratinocyte, produced both the full-length and alternatively spliced form of CaR lacking the human equivalent of exon 5 (originally reported as exon 4 (Ref. 14.Ho C. Conner D. Pollak M. Ladd D. Kifor O. Warren H. Brown E. Seidman J. Seidman C. Nat. Genet. 1995; 11: 389-394Crossref PubMed Scopus (523) Google Scholar) but renamed exon 5 by a recent study of the genomic structure of CaR (Ref. 15.Pearce S. Trump D. Wooding C. Besser G. Chew S. Grant D. Heath D. Hughes I. Paterson C. Whyte M. Thakker R. J. Clin. Invest. 1995; 96: 2683-2692Crossref PubMed Scopus (330) Google Scholar)). The disruption of the CaR in this mouse model resulted in the sole production of the alternatively spliced variant because of the fortuitous insertion of the neomycin cassette into exon 5. This mouse model provided us the opportunity to examine the differentiation of mouse epidermis in which only the alternatively spliced form was expressed. This report contains the first complete nucleotide sequence of mouse CaR cDNA, and our initial description of the consequences to the keratinocyte of deletion of the full-length but not the alternatively spliced form of the CaR. These results indicate that the full-length CaR is important for normal epidermal differentiation in vivo presumably by mediating the calcium signaling required for keratinocyte terminal differentiation. A partial mouse CaR cDNA clone (mCaR-R) was isolated using RT-PCR from total RNA from the kidneys of either wild type (+/+) or mutant (−/−) mice. A set of primers flanking exon 5 of the mouse CaR was obtained from Dr. C. Ho (Harvard Medical School, Cambridge, MA): sense primer (mCaR1309F, 5′-CAA GGT CAT TGT CGT TTT CTC CAG C-3′), and antisense primer (mCaR2307R, 5′-GCA ATG CAG GAG GTG TGG TTC TCA T-3′). The latter includes 2 mismatches to the mouse CaR sequence subsequently found, but it was adequate for the initial experiments. The 3′ clone of mouse CaR was obtained by 3′ RACE. Briefly, total RNA from mouse kidney was reverse transcribed (Superscript II, Life Technologies, Inc.) using the poly(T) adaptor (5′-GAC TCG AGT CGA CAT CGA TTT TTT TTT TTT TTT TT-3′). The 3′ cDNA was amplified by PCR using the gene-specific sense primer (5′-ATT AAT TCT GTC CAC AAT GG-3′, CaR1018) and antisense adaptor primer (5′-GAC TCG AGT CGA CAT CGA T-3′). The 5′ cDNA clone was isolated using 5′ RACE (Life Technologies, Inc.) using the manufacturer's protocol. Briefly, the RNA was reverse transcribed using the gene specific antisense primer (5′-GGA AGG CAT TGG AGC TAT TGA G-3′, mCaR1175R). The reverse transcribed cDNA was conjugated with poly(C) on the 5′ end using terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase. The cDNA was amplified by PCR using an anchor primer with poly(G) (5′-CUA CUA CUA CUA GGC CAC GCG TCG ACT AGT ACG GGI IGG GII GGG IIG-3′) and a nested gene-specific antisense primer (5′-CCA TTG TGG ACA GAC TTC CT-3′, CaR1018R). PCR amplification was performed using a mixedPfu and Taq DNA polymerase (Stratagene) under optimized conditions. The appropriate PCR fragments were subcloned into a pCR II or pCR2.1 vector (Invitrogen). The isolated cDNA clones were sequenced on both strands using vector-specific and gene-specific primers using a Dye termination cycle sequencing kit (Applied Biosystems) on an Applied Biosystems 373A automated DNA sequencer. The DNA sequence was analyzed using the GCG DNA analysis package at the Computer Graphics Laboratory at the University of California, San Francisco. The CaR disrupted mice were prepared by insertion of a neomycin-resistant gene into exon 5 (originally reported as exon 4 (Ref. 14.Ho C. Conner D. Pollak M. Ladd D. Kifor O. Warren H. Brown E. Seidman J. Seidman C. Nat. Genet. 1995; 11: 389-394Crossref PubMed Scopus (523) Google Scholar), but which corresponds to exon 5 of the human CaR gene (Ref. 15.Pearce S. Trump D. Wooding C. Besser G. Chew S. Grant D. Heath D. Hughes I. Paterson C. Whyte M. Thakker R. J. Clin. Invest. 1995; 96: 2683-2692Crossref PubMed Scopus (330) Google Scholar)). The mice were given to us as a gift by Drs. C. Ho and J. Siedman (14.Ho C. Conner D. Pollak M. Ladd D. Kifor O. Warren H. Brown E. Seidman J. Seidman C. Nat. Genet. 1995; 11: 389-394Crossref PubMed Scopus (523) Google Scholar). The genotype was determined by PCR analysis using the same primer set described in RT-PCR below. The expression of the two forms of CaR was determined by RT-PCR using a set of primers that spanned the missing region (exon 5) of the spliced variant. Total RNA was isolated from the epidermis or kidney of wild type (+/+), heterozygous (+/−), and homozygous (−/−) mutant mice. By reverse transcription using Superscript II (Life Technologies, Inc.), the region encompassing exon 5 was amplified with a sense primer (5′-CAA GGT CAT TGT CGT TTT CTC CAG C-3′, mCaR1309F) and an antisense primer (5′-GCA ATG CAG GAG GTG TGG TTC TCA T-3′, mCaR2307R). Each sample was also amplified using a pair of primers for human G3PDH (CLONTECH) as a control for cDNA loading in the PCR assay. Amplification was carried out using Taqpolymerase Plus (Stratagene) for 35 cycles for CaR and 30 cycles for G3PDH. The PCR products were analyzed by 3% agarose gel electrophoresis. Molecular weights of the bands were estimated by φX174/HaeIII fragments (Life Technologies, Inc.) as standards. The expression of CaR protein in the skin was detected by immunostaining. The skin was dissected from 7-day-old mice. The skin was fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde at room temperature. The sections were incubated with an affinity-purified polyclonal anti-CaR antibody (1:500) raised against an epitope of amino acids 215–237 of bovine CaR, which is 100% conserved in mouse CaR. The sections were then washed and incubated with horseradish peroxidase-coupled goat anti-rabbit secondary antibody (1:2000). The cells were stained with the Fast DAB substrate system (Sigma). Photomicrographs were taken with a 100× objective. Crude plasma membranes were isolated from mouse kidney as described (11.Oda Y. Tu C.-L. Pillai S. Bikle D.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 23344-23352Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar). Membrane fractions were also prepared from HEK293 cells transfected by human cDNA of full-length or spliced variant CaR (11.Oda Y. Tu C.-L. Pillai S. Bikle D.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 23344-23352Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar). Briefly, the tissues or cells were sonicated, and the membrane fractions were extracted with radioimmune precipitation buffer containing 1% deoxycholate, 1% Triton X-100, 0.1% SDS. Protein concentration in these membrane preparations was determined using the Pierce BCA protein assay (Pierce). The CaR proteins were analyzed by Western blot as described (11.Oda Y. Tu C.-L. Pillai S. Bikle D.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 23344-23352Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar). Briefly, the membrane protein samples were electrophoresed through polyacrylamide gels and electroblotted onto nylon membranes. After blocking, the blot was incubated with monoclonal antibody against human CaR at a dilution of 1:32,000 (0.1 μg/ml) (ADD antibody; gift from Dr. E. F. Nemeth, NPS Pharmaceuticals) overnight at 4 °C. As a control for specificity, the antibody was preabsorbed with the synthetic peptide against which the antibody was raised. Subsequently, the samples were incubated with secondary antibody conjugated with horseradish peroxidase (anti-mouse Ig, sheep antibody, Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) for 1 h at room temperature. The bound antibody was visualized using an enhanced chemiluminescence system (ECL, Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). Mouse keratinocytes were obtained from 2–4-day-old newborn mouse epidermis by trypsinization as described (15.Pearce S. Trump D. Wooding C. Besser G. Chew S. Grant D. Heath D. Hughes I. Paterson C. Whyte M. Thakker R. J. Clin. Invest. 1995; 96: 2683-2692Crossref PubMed Scopus (330) Google Scholar). Briefly, cells were grown in serum-free keratinocyte growth medium (KGM, Clonetics) with 0.05 mm Ca2+ (5.Gibson D.F.C. Ratman A.V. Bikle D.D. J. Invest. Dermatol. 1996; 106: 154-161Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). The [Ca2+]i response to elevated [Ca2+]o was measured as described (11.Oda Y. Tu C.-L. Pillai S. Bikle D.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 23344-23352Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar). Briefly, preconfluent keratinocytes grown on a coverslip were loaded with 7.5 μm Fura-2 AM and 0.05 mmcalcium in buffer A (20 mm Hepes, 120 mm NaCl, 5 mm KCl, 1 mm MgCl2, 1 mg/ml pyruvate, 1 mg/ml glucose). Cells were then exposed to 2.0 mm calcium. The fluorescence (ratio ofF 340 nm/F 380 nm) from single cells was recorded by an image analyzer. The signals from more than 20 single cells for each preparation were recorded, and an average profile was calculated. Each sample was calibrated by the addition of ionomycin (10 μm final concentration) (F max) followed by 0.1% Triton X-100 and 20 mm EGTA/Tris, pH 8.3 (F min). [Ca2+]i was calculated from the following formula: [Ca2+] =KdQ(R −R min)/(R max −R), R =F 340/F 380,Q =F min/F max at 380 nm, where K d for Fura-2 for Ca2+ is 224 nm. Dorsal skin samples of 3-day-old wild type (+/+) and mutant (−/−) mice were fixed in 4% formaldehyde. Tissue processing, in situ hybridization, and immunohistochemistry were performed as described previously (16.Kömüves L. Hanley K. Jiang Y. Elias P. Williams M. Feingold K. J. Invest. Dermatol. 1998; 111: 429-433Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar). Microscopic anatomy of the tissues was analyzed on toluidine blue- or hematoxylin-eosin-stained sections. A digoxigenin-labeled antisense loricrin RNA probe was made from linearized cDNA templates (gift from S. H. Yuspa, National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, MD), using enzymes and reagents supplied by Roche Molecular Biochemicals. Loricrin mRNA was detected by in situ hybridization using 5-bromo-4-chloro-3-indolyl phosphate/nitro blue tetrazolium substrate (Roche Molecular Biochemicals). Sense control RNA was used to establish the specificity of the hybridization. The affinity-purified rabbit antibody against loricrin (BABCO, Berkeley, CA). (17.Steven A. Bisher M. Roop D. Steinert P. J. Struct. Biol. 1990; 104: 150-162Crossref PubMed Scopus (170) Google Scholar) was used to stain the loricrin protein with biotinylated goat anti-rabbit IgG followed by ABC-peroxidase (both from Vector, Burlingame, CA). Peroxidase activity was revealed by DAB substrate (Vector). To initiate the sequencing of mouse CaR, both the full-length and anticipated alternatively spliced form, we first generated partial cDNA clones by RT-PCR using primers spanning exon 5 (14.Ho C. Conner D. Pollak M. Ladd D. Kifor O. Warren H. Brown E. Seidman J. Seidman C. Nat. Genet. 1995; 11: 389-394Crossref PubMed Scopus (523) Google Scholar). The RNA from the wild type (+/+) mice produced a 0.8-kilobase pair DNA of mouse CaR (mCaR-R). Mutant mice (−/−) generated a smaller DNA fragment (mCaR-S). Sequencing demonstrated that the clone mCaR-S has an in frame deletion of 231 bp of exon 5, which would cause deletion of 77 amino acids, equivalent to the naturally produced CaR spliced variant in human keratinocytes. The complete nucleotide sequence of mouse CaR was then determined using 5′ and 3′ RACE. The cDNA of mouse full-length CaR contains 4550 bp including an open reading frame of 3236 bp (525–3761) having a translation initiation codon assigned to the first in frame ATG with Kozak sequence (Fig. 1) (GenBank accession no. AF110178). The spliced variant includes 4319 bp lacking 231 bp of exon 5 (AF110179). The deduced amino acid sequence of full-length CaR consists of 1079 amino acids (M r∼120,000), and the spliced variant includes 1002 amino acids (M r ∼100,000). The full-length mouse CaR consists of three major domains: a large hydrophilic extracellular domain (EC), a transmembrane (TM) domain, and an intracellular domain (Fig. 2). The mouse CaR is highly homologous to the CaR from the rat (98% amino acid identity, respectively) (18.Riccardi D. Park J. Lee W. Gamba G. Brown E. Hebert S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

The position of exon 5, which is deleted in the spliced variant, is indicated as a region having 77 amino acids with 2 N-linked glycosylation sites and 10 acidic amino acids in the position of 460–537. The region of exon 5 was highly conserved among species, having only 1 amino acid difference from rat and human CaR among 77 amino acids, suggesting that the mouse alternatively spliced variant of CaR would show the same loss of acute calcium signaling as the human variant (11.Oda Y. Tu C.-L. Pillai S. Bikle D.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 23344-23352Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar). The mouse CaR is also homologous to metabotropic glutamate receptors, which belong to G protein-coupled receptor family 3, and showed the typical structural features conserved in this family. The hydrophobic segment in the N-terminal side of the EC domain (aa 148–176) was identified, which may contribute to the ligand binding pocket (20.Brown E. Gamba G. Riccardi D. Lombardi M. Butters R. Kifor O. Sun A. Hediger M. Lytton J. Hebert S. Nature. 1993; 366: 575-580Crossref PubMed Scopus (2384) Google Scholar). The 17 conserved Cys and the 6-Cys cluster in the C-terminal part (560–585) of the extracellular domain may be involved in disulfide bonds. The 7-TM domain includes a conserved cytoplasmic loop (795–805) having a PKC site (646) between the 5th and 6th TM. The C-terminal cytoplasmic domain (217 amino acids) contains 6 potential phosphorylation sites for PKC at 794, 888, 895, 915, 993, and 1059 in addition to two sites in the TM domain at 646, 699. Potential phosphorylation sites for cAMP-dependent protein kinase were present at aa 899 and 900, suggesting that cAMP also may modulate the function of CaR. The nucleotide sequence of mouse CaR reported here is 100% identical to a partial 500-bp CaR cDNA isolated from the mouse osteoblast (GenBank accession no. AF002015) (22.Quarles L.D. Hartle J.E.

Both full-length and the spliced variant of CaR were detected by RT-PCR using a primer set encompassing exon 5. Both the 1007-bp full-length CaR (upper band) and the 777 bp spliced variant (lower band) were expressed in the epidermis of (+/+) and (+/−) mice (Fig.3 B, lanes 1 and 2), although the epidermis of (−/−) mice expressed only the spliced variant (B, lane 3). In contrast, kidney, which is an abundant source of CaR, produced only the full-length CaR in the wild type (+/+) mice (A, lane 1), although it expressed the spliced variant in mutant (−/−) mice (A, lane 3). The heterozygous mice (+/−) produced both forms in the kidney (A, lane 2). The intermediate band (A, lane 2) observed in the sample from (+/−) mice is a hybrid of the full-length and variant forms. The level of G3PDH transcripts showed no significant differences among the three samples of epidermis (B, lanes 4–6) and kidney (A, lanes 4–6). These results indicate that these two forms of CaR are expressed in the mouse epidermis even in the wild type animal, and that the alternatively spliced variant is expressed in other tissues such as the kidney when the full-length form is deleted. Whether expression of this mRNA leads to production of protein CaR is the next question we addressed. The CaR mutant mice (−/−) were originally reported not to produce CaR protein (14.Ho C. Conner D. Pollak M. Ladd D. Kifor O. Warren H. Brown E. Seidman J. Seidman C. Nat. Genet. 1995; 11: 389-394Crossref PubMed Scopus (523) Google Scholar). However, the mRNA data suggested that at least in the skin and kidney, the alternatively spliced CaR protein was likely to be produced in mutant (−/−) mice. In order to verify this prediction, we immunostained the skin from (+/+) and (−/−) mice using a polyclonal antibody against CaR (11.Oda Y. Tu C.-L. Pillai S. Bikle D.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 23344-23352Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar). The CaR was detected throughout the upper layers of epidermis of the 7-day-old wild type (+/+) mice (Fig.4 A). The epithelial cells around the hair follicle also stained strongly for CaR (A). Similar staining was observed in the skin of the CaR mutant (−/−) mice (B). The staining with pre-immune IgG did not show significant signal (C). When the antibody was pre-adsorbed with excess peptide against which the antibody was raised, the staining was markedly reduced (D). These results show that CaR is present in the epidermis on both wild type (+/+) and mutant (−/−) mice. We next analyzed CaR proteins by Western blot. The membrane fraction from the mouse kidney was prepared. The wild type (+/+) and heterozygous (+/−) mice expressed two major bands of CaR, estimated as ∼140 and ∼160 kDa (Fig. 5,lanes 1 and 2). These two bands correspond in size of the two differently glycosylated forms of human CaR expressed in HEK293 cells transfected with cDNA for the full-length CaR (lane 4) (11.Oda Y. Tu C.-L. Pillai S. Bikle D.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 23344-23352Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar). In contrast, the homozygous mutant (−/−) mice had only a ∼130-kDa band (lane 3), which corresponds to the single band of CaR transfected with the human spliced variant cDNA (lane 5) (11.Oda Y. Tu C.-L. Pillai S. Bikle D.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 23344-23352Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar). The size of the ∼130-kDa band is consistent with the spliced variant lacking 77 amino acids (lane 3) having altered glycosylation. The bands at ∼130, ∼140, and ∼160 kDa were removed by pre-adsorption of antibody (data not shown). The lower band around 100 kDa was nonspecific (lanes 1–3). The CaR protein was less readily detected in epidermal samples using Western analysis unlike immunolocalization. These results indicate that the full-length CaR is produced in the wild type (+/+) mice, although the spliced variant of CaR protein is still expressed in knockout mice (−/−).Figure 5Western analysis of the CaR in membrane protein preparations from knockout (−/−) mice. The membrane proteins were isolated from the kidney of mutant mice (lanes 1–3) and HEK 293 cells transfected with human full-length CaR (lane 4) or spliced variant CaR (lane 5). The CaR was detected using a monoclonal antibody against CaR (ADD). The wild type (+/+) (lane 1) and heterozygous (+/−) samples (lane 2) showed the ∼140- and ∼160-kDa bands, which correspond to the glycosylated forms of CaR of human full-length CaR in HEK293 cells (lane 4). The homozygous (−/−) mice expressed a ∼130-kDa band (lane 3), corresponding to the human spliced variant (lane 5) expressed in HEK293 cells. The lower band was nonspecific. The specificity of the upper three bands were confirmed by pre-adsorption of the antibody with peptide against which the antibody was raised.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) We have previously demonstrated that cultured human keratinocytes increase their [Ca2+]i in response to raised [Ca2+]o and that this response is necessary for calcium-induced keratinocyte differentiation. To determine whether the alternatively spliced CaR can substitute for the full-length CaR, we compared the [Ca2+]i response to [Ca2+]o in keratinocytes from wild type and mutant mice. The keratinocytes were isolated from the mouse epidermis and cultured in low Ca2+ (0.03 mm) to prevent differentiation. The [Ca2+]i response to [Ca2+]o (2.0 mm) was measured using Fura-2. The keratinocytes from wild type (+/+) mice had lower basal [Ca2+]i of 57 nm but increased this [Ca2+]i to 891 nmafter addition of 2.0 mm[Ca2+]o (Fig.6). In contrast, keratinocytes from mutant mice (−/−) showed higher basal [Ca2+]i (283 nm), and increased their [Ca2+]i only slightly to 333 nm following the calcium switch (Fig. 6). These results indicate that the full-length CaR is required for normal acute [Ca2+]i response to [Ca2+]o, and this function can not be replaced with the alternatively spliced CaR. To determine whether the loss of the full-length CaR is accompanied by altered epidermal differentiation, we analyzed the skin of the CaR mutant (−/−) mice. By 3 days after birth, the skin from mutant mice was shinier, less pigmented, and appeared thinner. This difference was less apparent after 7 days. The histopathology of 3-day-old mutant mice (−/−) showed a modest reduction in the number of nucleated epidermal cell layers, with a disordered differentiation sequence, demonstrated by abnormal polarity and flattening from the basal through suprabasal cells in comparison to wild type epidermis (Fig.7). In addition, both the stratum granulosum and the density of keratohyalin granules appeared to be reduced in the epidermis of mutant mice (Fig. 7). The same results were obtained in comparison with wild type littermates and with wild type animals from different litters. These results indicate that the CaR plays an important role in vivo during epidermal morphogenesis. To examine the effect of deletion of the full-length CaR on differentiation, we next compared the expression of the terminal differentiation marker, loricrin, in 3-day-old mutant (−/−) mice (Fig. 8, B, D, andF) with wild type (+/+) mice (A, C, and E). The histologic appearance (A andB), the loricrin mRNA (C and D), and protein levels of loricrin (E and F) are shown in the same skin samples. Whereas loricrin mRNA and protein levels and localization in wild type epidermis were as expected (C and E), the epidermis of the mutant (−/−) mice was altered (D and F). In wild type epidermis, loricrin mRNA was found in the stratum granulosum (C), where it was very abundant. In contrast, an extremely low (almost undetectable) signal for loricrin mRNA was present across the suprabasal layers of the epidermis in mutant mice (D), and most cells in the stratum granulosum did not show any accumulation of loricrin message. Even those occasional cells of the stratum granulosum which had a stronger signal, stained much less intensely than granular cells in the wild type epidermis. This expression pattern of the loricrin gene was paralleled in the localization of its protein product. In wild type epidermis, loricrin was localized in a sharply demarcated manner to the stratum granulosum (E). In mutant epidermis, however, a weak, diffuse immunostaining was seen (F) across the suprabasal epidermis, with lack of increased staining in the stratum granulosum. Therefore, in the absence of the full-length CaR, loricrin expression and localization are markedly reduced. These results strongly suggest that the full-length CaR is required for epidermal differentiation. The identification of the CaR provided an important step toward our understanding of how calcium regulates cell function. The ability of calcium to regulate keratinocyte growth and differentiation is well established (1.Hennings H. Michael D. Cheng C. Steinert P. Holbrook K. Yuspa S.H. Cell. 1980; 19: 245-254Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1507) Google Scholar, 2.Pillai S. Bikle D.D. Mancianti M.L. Cline P. Hincenbergs M. J. Cell. Physiol. 1990; 143: 294-302Crossref PubMed Scopus (210) Google Scholar). The discovery that the CaR, which was originally identified in the parathyroid gland and kidney, was also found in keratinocytes (10.Bikle D.D. Ratman A. Mauro T. Harris J. Pillai S. J. Clin. Invest. 1996; 97: 1085-1093Crossref PubMed Scopus (183) Google Scholar) suggested a common mechanism for calcium signaling in these different cell types. Deletions of the full-length CaR by homologous recombination in which the mutant gene contained a neomycin cassette in the mouse equivalent of exon 5 resulted in a phenotype comparable to neonatal hyperparathyroidism (14.Ho C. Conner D. Pollak M. Ladd D. Kifor O. Warren H. Brown E. Seidman J. Seidman C. Nat. Genet. 1995; 11: 389-394Crossref PubMed Scopus (523) Google Scholar). However, when we examine the epidermis of these mice using an antibody to the CaR, we found abundant protein CaR. Since we had previously observed that human keratinocytes produce an alternatively spliced form of CaR in which same exon 5 was deleted, we asked whether the mouse epidermis did likewise, and if so whether this would explain the finding that the CaR (−/−) mice continued to produce immunologically detectable CaR. To initiate this investigation, we first determined the complete nucleotide sequence of mouse CaR. The mouse CaR is highly homologous to CaR from other species including the rat (18.Riccardi D. Park J. Lee W. Gamba G. Brown E. Hebert S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 131-135Crossref PubMed Scopus (437) Google Scholar), human (19.Garrett J.E. Capuano I.V. Hammerland L.G.

Riccardi D. Lombardi M. Butters R. Kifor O. Sun A. Hediger M. Lytton J. Hebert S. Nature. 1993; 366: 575-580Crossref PubMed Scopus (2384) Google Scholar), and puffy fish (21.Naito T. Saito Y. Yamamoto J. Nozaki Y. Tomura K. Hazama M. Nakanishi S. Brenner S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci U. S. A. 1998; 95: 5178-5181Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar). The structural conservation of EC and TM domains were high (>90% amino acid identity) including fish CaR, suggesting the evolutionary conservation of these regions. The intracellular domain has more variation in amino acids and in length, suggesting that the signaling functions of this receptor may vary from fish to mammals. As in human keratinocytes, the mouse epidermis makes both the full-length and the spliced variant lacking exon 5. As shown first in human keratinocytes, and now in mouse keratinocytes from CaR mutant mice, the region of exon 5 is critical to the function of CaR at least with respect to the initial response to calcium shown by IP3 production and [Ca2+]i response. The mechanism of functional abolishment by exon 5 is not well understood, although several possibilities were considered. A change in binding affinity to calcium may be caused by the deletion of 10 acidic amino acids in this region of CaR. In addition, the glycosylation of the twoN-linked glycosylation sites may be critical for correct folding or transport of CaR protein to the membrane; the spliced variant has an altered glycosylation pattern. The full-length CaR is expressed in normal cells as two bands: the ∼160- and ∼140-kDa bands. From the analysis of human CaR, we predict that the ∼160-kDa band is the mature functional form of CaR, and that the ∼140-kDa band may be an intermediate product of CaR because it has endoglycosidase H-sensitive high mannose type oligosaccharide (11.Oda Y. Tu C.-L. Pillai S. Bikle D.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 23344-23352Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar). In contrast, the spliced variant is expressed as a single band of ∼130 kDa, having only the high mannose type glycosylation. The availability of a mouse model in which the full-length but not the spliced variant CaR was “knocked out” gave us the opportunity to determine the degree to which the alternatively spliced form could compensate for loss of the full-length form in terms of epidermal differentiation. Previous studies with this model (11.Oda Y. Tu C.-L. Pillai S. Bikle D.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 23344-23352Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar) clearly showed loss of normal calcium homeostasis in that these animals were severely hypercalcemic and died within a few weeks of birth. The keratinocytes from the CaR mutant mice did not respond to elevated [Ca2+]o with an increase in [Ca2+]i, clearly showing that the full-length CaR is required to mediate calcium signaling. However, we also observed that the CaR mutant keratinocytes maintained a higher basal [Ca2+]i level compared with normal cells, suggesting additional alterations in calcium regulation by CaR mutant keratinocytes. Higher resting [Ca2+]i levels were also observed in calreticulin-deficient mice, in which the [Ca2+]i response to ATP or bradykinin was abolished (23.Nakamura N. Krause K.-H. Michala M. FASEB J. 1999; 13: A1563Google Scholar). Therefore, a rise in [Ca2+]i under circumstances in which normal calcium signaling is disrupted may result in increased [Ca2+]i by way of compensation. The in vivo significance of this altered calcium signaling may be reflected in the altered differentiation pattern of the epidermis, as demonstrated by both the changes in morphology and expression of loricrin. The epidermis of the CaR mutant mice showed disordered differentiation with reduction of the number of epidermal layers, especially within the first few days of the birth. These differences were not observed after day 7. However, the differentiation marker loricrin still was decreased in mutant mice at this stage. These alterations in calcium response, skin morphology, and loricrin expression are not likely to result secondarily from the hypercalcemia of these animals. The calcium response was measured in cultured keratinocytes grown in low (0.03 mm) calcium conditions, which should obviate differences in calcium concentrations in vivo. The changes in morphology were only observed shortly after birth, and they were normalized with time, whereas the rise in serum calcium was progressive. Loricrin expression ought to be increased by hypercalcemia, not decreased. Therefore, the observed changes are more consistent with an intrinsic defect in calcium signaling by the CaR mutant (−/−) keratinocytes than a secondary response to hypercalcemia. In summary, we have reported the complete structure of mouse CaR and its alternatively spliced variant. Both are produced by the epidermis, but when the full-length CaR is deleted, the spliced variant is produced in other tissues that normally express only the full-length CaR. Keratinocytes lacking the full-length CaR do not respond to calcium normally, indicating that the full-length CaR is required for normal calcium signaling. The skin lacking the full-length CaR showed thinner epidermis with disordered differentiation, and decreased loricrin expression. These results indicate that CaR is required for normal epidermal differentiation in vivo, presumably by mediating the calcium signaling required for normal keratinocyte differentiation.

The signal transduction of bone morphogenetic proteins has recently been discovered to involve Smad proteins. Smad1 is an essential intracellular component that is specifically phosphorylated by bone morphogenetic protein receptors and translocated into the nucleus upon ligand stimulation. Previously, we have reported that Smad1 activates osteopontin gene expression in response to bone morphogenetic protein simulation through an interaction with a homeodomain transcription factor, Hoxc-8. In the present study, the interaction domains between the two proteins were characterized by deletional analysis in both yeast two-hybrid and gel shift assays. Two regions within the amino-terminal 87 amino acid residues of Smad1 were mapped to interact with Hoxc-8, one of which binds to the homeodomain. Overexpression of recombinant cDNAs encoding the Hoxc-8 interaction domains of Smad1 effectively activated osteopontin gene transcription in transient transfection assays. Furthermore, stable expression of these Smad1 fragments in 2T3 osteoblast precursor cells stimulated osteoblast differentiation-related gene expression and led to mineralized bone matrix formation. Our data suggest that the interaction of amino-terminal Smad1 with Hoxc-8 mimics bone morphogenetic protein signaling and is sufficient to induce osteoblast differentiation and bone cell formation.

Nature. 1997; 388: 304-308Crossref PubMed Scopus (450) Google Scholar). Smad1 consists of three distinct domains: two highly conserved amino- (NH2-) and carboxyl- (COOH-) terminal domains, referred to as MH1 (mad homology 1) and MH2, respectively, and a more divergent intervening linker region. MH1 has DNA binding activity when MH2 is removed. MH2 contains a conserved receptor phosphorylation motif, SSXS, and has transactivation activity. Cross-talk between Smad and mitogen-activated protein kinase signaling pathways is conferred by the linker region in which the serine residues can be phosphorylated by mitogen-activated protein kinases, leading to an inhibition of Smad1 translocation into the nucleus (12.Kretzschmar M. Doody J. Massague J. Nature. 1997; 389: 618-622Crossref PubMed Scopus (775) Google Scholar). In the inactive state, MH1 and MH2 bind to one another, mutually inhibiting the function of each domain. In the active state, the phosphorylation of Smad1 opens up this structure to allow association with Smad4 or with other DNA-binding proteins via the MH2 domain (13.Tsukazaki T. Chiang T.A.

Studies on the mechanism by which Smads mediate TGF-β/activin-regulated gene transcription have led to the discovery of several Smad-interacting nuclear transcription factors and theircis-acting DNA elements. In particular, theXenopus FAST-1 (forkhead activin signal transducer-1) binds to an activin response element upstream of the homeobox gene Mix.2. The transcription activation requires the presence of activin and assembly of a FAST-1-Smad2-Smad4 complex (16.Chen X. Weisberg E. Fridmacher V. Watanabe M. Naco G. Whitman M. Nature. 1997; 389: 85-89Crossref PubMed Scopus (494) Google Scholar). The mammalian homolog FAST-2 activates the hox gene goosecoid where formation of a higher order complex of FAST-2-Smad2-Smad4 is also essential for transactivation (17.Labbe E. Silvestri C. Hoodless P.A. Wrana J.L. Attisano L. Mol. Cell. 1998; 2: 109-120Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (464) Google Scholar). Transcription factor μF3 binds to the E-box of plasminogen activator inhibitor-1 promoter, whereas Smad3 and Smad4 bind to a sequence adjacent to the transcription factor μF3 binding site to cooperatively activate plasminogen activator inhibitor-1 gene transcription (18.Hua X. Liu X. Ansari D.O. Lodish H.F. Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 3084-3095Crossref PubMed Scopus (259) Google Scholar). In contrast to the TGF-β/activin pathway, little progress has been made in the identification of factors involved in Smad1-mediated transcriptional regulation in response to BMP signaling. We have reported that Smad1 interacts with homeodomain transcription factor Hoxc-8 (9.Shi X. Yang X. Chen D. Chang Z. Cao X. J. Biol.

The present study is aimed at investigating the mechanism by which the Smad1-Hoxc-8 interaction mediates induction of osteoblast differentiation. We show that two domains, one within MH1 and the other at the MH1-linker boundary of Smad1, interact with the Hoxc-8 and are functionally sufficient to activate bone marker gene transcription. More importantly, permanent expression of these Hoxc-8 interaction domains in 2T3 osteoblast precursor cells is able to mimic BMP signaling and induce osteoblast terminal differentiation. cDNAs encoding full-length forms of Smad1 and Hoxc-8 were fused in-frame to the GAL4 DNA binding domain of pGBT9 vector and to the GAL4 activation domain of pACT2 vector, respectively, to obtain the bait and prey plasmids as described previously (9.Shi X. Yang X. Chen D. Chang Z. Cao X. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 13711-13717Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar). All of the Smad1 or Hoxc-8 deletion constructs as indicated in figures were generated by Pfu(Stratagene) polymerase chain reaction-based strategy and inserted into their respective bait (pGBT9) or prey (pACT2) vectors. Resultant constructs were sequenced and subjected to yeast two-hybrid assays. To facilitate the interaction test, we first transformed a yeast reporter strain Y190 with the bait or prey plasmids and selected on SD/-Trp plate for pGBT9/Smad1 and SD/-Leu plate for the pACT2/Hoxc-8. Various deletions of Hoxc-8 were transformed individually into Y190 bearing pGBT9/Smad1, whereas the different truncated constructs of Smad1 were transformed into Y190 containing pACT2/Hoxc-8. The methods of constructing the bacterial expression plasmids for GST-Smad1 and GST-Hoxc-8 have been described previously (9.Shi X. Yang X. Chen D. Chang Z. Cao X. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 13711-13717Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar). GST fusion constructs of all of the Smad1 and Hoxc-8 deletion mutants were made by the polymerase chain reaction-based strategy with the pGEX-KG vector. Bacterially expressed GST fusion proteins were purified with glutathione substrate-affinity agarose beads (Sigma) as described (27.Guan K.L. Dixon J.E. Anal. Biochem. 1991; 192: 262-267Crossref PubMed Scopus (1641) Google Scholar) and analyzed for their purity by 10% SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. In vitrobinding was studied using a gel shift assay (28.Cao X. Teitelbaum S.L. Zhu H.J. Zhang L. Feng X. Ross F.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 20650-20654Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar) with constant amounts (1.5 μg for all forms of GST-Smad, 0.2 μg for GST-Hoxc-8, and 10 ng for deletions of GST-HDC and GST-HD) of purified GST fusion proteins. A double-stranded oligomer corresponding to the osteopontin promoter, −206 to −180 relative to the transcription start site (OPN-5) labeled using T4 polynucleotide kinase and [γ-32P]ATP, was used as probe. The single Hoxc-8 binding site and its flanking region derived from osteopontin promoter −290 to −166 were inserted in the pGL3 control vector (Promega) that uses luciferase as reporter (Hox-pGL3) (9.Shi X. Yang X. Chen D. Chang Z. Cao X. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 13711-13717Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar). The plasmids encoding various forms of Smad1 fused with a nuclear localization signal were constructed by inserting the polymerase chain reaction-amplified fragments into the cytomegalovirus (CMV) promoter-based mammalian expression vector pCMV5. Each construct contained one of the following regions: Smad1-NL (amino acids (aa) 3–278), Smad1-L (aa 145–278), and Smad1-M (aa 101–191). The expression plasmid for Hoxc-8 was made by subcloning the cDNA from pACT2/Hoxc-8 into pcDNA3 (Invitrogen). C3H10T1/2 cells (5 × 104 cells/well in a 12-well culture dish) were transfected with 0.5 μg of Hox-pGL3 plasmid together with 200 ng of the indicated constructs using Tfx-50 as instructed (Promega). Luciferase activity was determined 16 h after the start of transfection, and values were normalized with protein content. The luciferase activity shown in the figures is representative of transfections performed in triplicate in at least three independent experiments. The tetracycline-regulated expression system (Life Technologies, Inc.) was used for inducible expression of Smad1-Hoxc-8 interaction domains of Smad1 in 2T3 osteoblast precursor cells (29.Ghosh-Choudhury N. Windle J.J. Koop B.A. Harris M.A. Guerrero D.L. Wozney J.M. Mundy G.R. Harris S.E. Endocrinology. 1996; 137: 331-339Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). Smad1-NL, -L, or -M linked to a nuclear localization signal was subcloned from pCMV5 into pTet-Splice vector (Life Technologies, Inc.). 2T3 cells (105cells/60-mm dish) were transfected with a mixture of 2 μg of either empty pTet-Splice vector (control), recombinant pTet-Splice/Smad1-NL, -L, or -M along with 2 μg of pTet-tTAk, and 12 μl of Tfx-50 (Promega) in α-minimal essential medium containing 0.5 μg/ml tetracycline. pcDNA3 (40 ng) was also included in the DNA mixture to provide a selective marker plasmid that expresses resistance to G418. 2 days after transfection, cells were replated and α-minimal essential medium containing 10% fetal bovine serum, 0.5 μg/ml tetracycline, and 400 μg/ml G418 was added to exclude nontransfected cells. 2–3 weeks later, drug-resistant colonies developed from single cells were isolated and maintained in α-minimal essential medium containing 10% fetal bovine serum, 0.2 mg/ml G418, and 0.5 μg/ml tetracycline. To induce the expression of Smad1 fragments, tetracycline was omitted from the growth medium. The expression was analyzed with Slot-Blot (Bio-Rad) by Northern hybridization using 5 μg of total RNA and 5 × 105 cpm/ml [α-32P]dCTP-labeled appropriate cDNA probes. Total RNA was prepared with STAT-60 (Tel-Test) from G418-resistant clones grown in a medium with or without tetracycline. 10–20 clones of each indicated construct were analyzed. The tetracycline-regulated Smad1 fragment-expressing clones were kept for further characterization of the osteoblastic phenotype as described below. 2T3 and its derivative cell lines containing empty pTet-Splice (vector control) and those displaying regulated expression of indicated Smad1 fragments were grown in the absence of tetracycline to reach confluence. Then the medium was replaced with a medium consisting of 5% fetal bovine serum, 0.1 mg/ml ascorbic acid, and 5 mm β-glycerol phosphate with or without 50 ng/ml recombinant human (rh) BMP-2 in α-minimal essential medium. mRNA was isolated at day 4 with MicroPoly(A)Pure (Ambion), and 3 μg of poly(A)+ RNA was used for Northern blot using Rapid-Hyb buffer (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) according to the manufacturer's direction. Probes for osteopontin and osf-2/cbfa1were polymerase chain reaction amplified using cDNA prepared from rhBMP-2-treated C3H10T1/2 cells as template. Type I procollagen α1(1) cDNA was kindly provided by D. Chen (University of Texas). Bone cell differentiation was monitored by alkaline phosphatase (ALP) assay (30.Begley C.T. Doherty M.J. Hankey D.P. Wilson D.J. Bone. 1993; 14: 661-666Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar) and von Kossa stain of mineralized bone matrix (31.Bellows C.G. Aubin J.E. Heersche J.N. Antosz M.E. Calcif. Tissue Int. 1986; 38: 143-154Crossref PubMed Scopus (780) Google Scholar). In brief, cells were prepared in a fashion similar to that described in the Northern analysis except that the cell density was 5 × 104cells/well in 12-well culture plates for ALP assay and 2 × 104 cells/well in 24-well plates for mineralization staining. Cells were lysed with 0.05% Triton 2 days after reaching confluence. ALP activity was assayed usingp-nitrophenol phosphate (Sigma) as the substrate. TheA 405 was normalized to protein content, and the data shown are representative of positive clones. For von Kossa staining, cells were washed with phosphate-buffered saline, fixed with formalin, and stained with 2% silver nitrate and with 1% acid fuchsin as described (31.Bellows C.G. Aubin J.E. Heersche J.N. Antosz M.E. Calcif. Tissue Int. 1986; 38: 143-154Crossref PubMed Scopus (780) Google Scholar) with the exception of the dehydration and rehydration steps, which were omitted. The interaction of Smad1 and Hoxc-8 in yeast by two-hybrid assay, in mammalian cells by coimmunoprecipitation, and in vitro by pull-down analysis has been demonstrated previously (9.Shi X. Yang X. Chen D. Chang Z. Cao X. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 13711-13717Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar). To resolve region(s) mediating the protein-protein interaction, we first constructed five Smad1 deletions by removing various amino acids from either the NH2 terminus, COOH terminus, or both. All of these deletion forms of Smad1, pGBT9/Smad1 (positive control), and empty bait plasmid pGBT9 (negative control) were transformed individually into yeast reporter strain Y190 carrying a prey plasmid pACT2/Hoxc-8 to test their associations with full-length Hoxc-8. Transformants were plated on a medium deficient in His, Trp, and Leu. Fig. 1 A shows that all forms of Smad1 containing MH1 (3–169) and/or linker domains (148–278) were able to grow. In contrast, yeast containing empty pGBT9 or pGBT9/MH2 (279–465) failed to grow. These results suggest that the Hoxc-8 interaction domains of Smad1 may locate within the MH1 and linker domains. To localize further the domains involved in the protein-protein interaction, we took advantage of our previous observation from gel shift assays in which GST-Smad1 fusion protein inhibited Hoxc-8 binding to OPN-5, a 27-base pair element derived from the osteopontin promoter from −206 to −180 (9.Shi X. Yang X. Chen D. Chang Z. Cao X. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 13711-13717Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar). A set of Smad1 fragments fused with GST was expressed in bacteria and purified to homogeneity as shown in Fig.1 A. An equal amount (1.5 μg) of each purified GST-Smad1 or its deletion mutants was incubated with 0.2 μg of GST-Hoxc-8 and OPN-5 probe for gel shift assays. Fig. 1 B shows that the binding of Hoxc-8 (lane 4) was reduced by the addition of wild type Smad1 (lane 5) or mutant Smad1 containing either MH1 (3–169, lane 6) or linker (148–278, lane 8) to the binding reaction. A strong inhibition was observed in the Smad1 retaining both MH1 and linker domain (3–278, lane 7). In contrast, the binding of Hoxc-8 remained unchanged when GST-MH2 was added (lane 10). The Hoxc-8 binding was only slightly reduced by Smad1 containing both linker and MH2 (148–465, lane 9). It is possible that the MH2 domain prevents the linker from interacting with Hoxc-8 through MH2-linker interaction. These data are consistent with earlier observations in the yeast two-hybrid analysis (Fig. 1 A). To define the inhibitory regions within each domain, MH1 and linker domains were truncated further into smaller segments (Fig. 1 A). Similar gel shift assays using these smaller Smad1 derivatives resolved two regions of aa 101–144 within the Smad1 MH1 domain and aa 148–191 at the MH1-linker junction which were sufficient for the interaction (Fig. 1 B, lanes 13–16). Both fragments were shown to inhibit Hoxc-8 binding to OPN-5 in a dose-dependent manner (Fig. 1 C,lanes 2–7) where 6 μg of each diminished the binding (Fig. 1 C, lanes 4 and 7). These results indicate that two regions within the NH2 terminus of Smad1 can account for the inhibition of Hoxc-8 binding to its cognate DNA element. Hox proteins have in common a similar homeodomain (HD) consisting of a highly conserved DNA binding motif of 60 amino acid residues (32.Sharkey M. Graba Y. Scott M.P. Trends Genet. 1997; 13: 145-151Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar). In addition to the HD that lies from aa 149 to 209, Hoxc-8 contains two other conserved regions (CR), CR1 (aa 1–8) and a hexapeptide (aa 137–142) located upstream from the homeodomain (21.Le Mouellic H. Condamine H. Brulet P. Genes Dev. 1988; 2: 125-135Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar) (Fig. 2). The hexapeptide of Leu-Met-Phe-Pro-Trp-Met is presumably involved in the interaction with Hox-assisting cofactors such as the Pbx family (33.Phelan M.L. Rambaldi I. Featherstone M.S. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 3989-3997Crossref PubMed Scopus (202) Google Scholar). The regions outside of the HD may determine the functional specificity of Hox proteins (32.Sharkey M. Graba Y. Scott M.P. Trends Genet. 1997; 13: 145-151Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar, 34.Sreenath T.L. Pollock R.A. Bieberich C.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 9636-9640Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar). To determine region(s) that are involved in the association with Smad1, we constructed five deletion mutants of Hoxc-8 in addition to the originally identified truncated form of Hoxc-8 clone 19 (Fig. 2). pACT2 prey plasmid containing nonrelated cDNA (randomly chosen from cDNA library (9.Shi X. Yang X. Chen D. Chang Z. Cao X. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 13711-13717Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar) as a control), the full-length, and the deletion mutants of Hoxc-8 were transformed separately into Y190 harboring pGBT9/Smad1 bait plasmid, and β-galactosidase activity was assayed. Fig. 2 shows that the full-length Hoxc-8 (1–242) and all four HD-containing deletions (67–237, 137–242, 151–242, and 151–212) interacted with Smad1 as indicated by higher β-galactosidase activity compared with the negative control. The association was stronger with full-length Hoxc-8 and clone 19 compared with HD alone (151–212), indicating that the NH2-terminal region of Hoxc-8 contributes to the interaction. However, two constructs containing only the NH2-terminal region (1–137 and 1–151) failed to bind Smad1, showing negligible β-galactosidase activity (Fig. 2). This suggests that the NH2 terminus does not participate directly in the protein-protein interaction between Hoxc-8 and Smad1. The NH2-terminal region may help to stabilize the proper configuration of the homeodomain increasing its interaction with Smad1. Elimination of conserved region-1 (compare 1–242 with clone 19) and the hexapeptide (compare 137–242 with 151–242) appeared to produce no significant reduction in the association (Fig. 2). In fact, HD alone is sufficient to support the interaction (Fig. 2, 151–212), suggesting that HD is involved directly in Hoxc-8-Smad1 interaction. To delineate whether the COOH-terminal extension of HD contributes to the protein-protein interaction by gel shift assay, cDNAs encoding HD (151–212) or HDC (151–242) were cloned into pGEX-KG vector to make truncated forms of GST-Hoxc-8 fusion proteins. Purified GST-HDC and GST-HD (10 ng) bound to the OPN-5 probe. Reaction with full-length GST-Hoxc-8 (0.2 μg) was run alongside for comparison (Fig.3 A). The affinity of GST-HDC and GST-HD to the DNA probe is at least 20 times higher, suggesting that the NH2 terminus not only assists the Hoxc-8 to interact with Smad1 (Fig. 2) but also modulates the protein binding to its cognate element. Both deletions of Hoxc-8 were also tested for their interaction with either wild type or mutant Smad1. As shown in Fig. 3, B and C, the binding pattern of HDC and HD to the OPN-5 is nearly identical and is also comparable to that of full-length Hoxc-8 (Fig. 1 B). Similarly, Smad1 and all other MH1 or linker-containing mutants inhibited the binding of both HDC and HD to the probe. Interestingly, the MH1 domain showed the strongest inhibition of HDC and HD domains, which is different from the pattern seen earlier with full-length Hoxc-8 binding (compare Fig. 3,B and C, 3–169 and 3–144, with Fig.1 B, 3–278). Note that the linker region alone (148–278) and its smaller deletion (148–191) had no effect on the HDC and HD binding (Fig. 3, B and C). The binding of both HDC and HD to DNA was reduced by the smaller domain (aa 101–144), but it required a higher amount (6 μg; Fig. 3, B andC). As a control, the same amount of GST (6 μg) had no effect on the binding (lane 14 in Fig. 3, B andC). Collectively, these data suggest that the HD of Hoxc-8 is sufficient for the interaction with Smad1 possibly by making direct contact with amino acid residues within MH1 domain. The C3H10T1/2 (C3H) mesenchymal cell line provides an ideal model system for exploring the mechanism of Smad1-mediated BMP signaling. In response to BMP stimulation, C3H expresses bone markers, including osteopontin, ALP, collagen type I, and sialoprotein genes, leading to mineral deposition, the terminal stage of osteoblast differentiation (4.Ahrens M. Ankenbauer T. Schroder D. Hollnagel A. Mayer H. Gross G. DNA Cell Biol. 1993; 12: 871-880Crossref PubMed Scopus (311) Google Scholar, 35.Taylor S.M. Jones P.A. Cell. 1979; 17: 771-779Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (900) Google Scholar). Previously, we have reported that Hoxc-8 binds to a 266-base pair osteopontin promoter fragment and represses reporter gene transcription. Cotransfection of Smad1, Smad4, and a constitutively active form of the BMP type I receptor ALK3 (Q233D) in C3H cells induces reporter gene transcription (9.Shi X. Yang X. Chen D. Chang Z. Cao X. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 13711-13717Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar). Two regions of Smad1, Hoxc-8 interaction domains (HIDs), aa 101–144 (HID1) and aa 148–191 (HID2), are sufficient to inhibit Hoxc-8 binding to DNA (Fig. 1). To investigate the transcription activity of the HIDs of Smad1, we constructed three cDNA fragments. One fragment, Smad1-L (linker region), contained one Hoxc-8 interaction domain (HID2). Two others, Smad1-NL (N-domain and linker) and Smad1-M (minimal region of HIDs), held both HIDs. These constructs were fused with a nuclear localization signal into a CMV5 mammalian expression vector (Fig. 4 A). The same reporter Hox-pGL3 containing a Hoxc-8 binding site in front of the luciferase gene and SV-40 promoter (9.Shi X. Yang X. Chen D. Chang Z. Cao X. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 13711-13717Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar) was used for the transfections. Cotransfection was performed with Hox-pGL3 or its mutant (mHox-pGL3 (9.Shi X. Yang X. Chen D. Chang Z. Cao X. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 13711-13717Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar)) and plasmids for various Smad1 fragments separately. Results showed that Smad1-NL (3–276), -L (145–276), and -M (101–191) containing either one or both HIDs stimulated osteopontin promoter activity as monitored by the luciferase assay (2–4-fold). The reporter's activity was suppressed when Hoxc-8 was coexpressed (Fig.4 B). The minimal region containing both HIDs increased Hox-pGL3 reporter activity in a dose-dependent manner (Fig.4 C). In contrast, none of these Smad1 fragments affected the luciferase activity of the mHox-pGL3 reporter in which the Hox binding site was mutated (data no"

Nevertheless, the mechanisms underlying channel localization are poorly understood.

Could these phenomena be related? To test this possibility we examined the effect of PSD-95 on the internalization rate of Kv1.4 K+ channels in transfected HEK293 cells using cell-surface biotinylation assays. When expressed alone Kv1.4 was internalized with a half-life of 87 min, but, in the presence of PSD-95, Kv1.4 internalization was completely suppressed.

Clustering was necessary and sufficient to suppress Kv1.4 internalization since C35S-PSD-95, a mutant reported to bind but not cluster Kv1.4, (confirmed by imaging cells co-expressing a functional, GFP-variant-tagged Kv1.4) restored and, surprisingly, enhanced the rate of Kv1.4 internalization (t 12 = 16 min).

Molecular genetic studies indicate that K+ channels are encoded by numerous genes whose products can be classified into distinct subfamilies of which the most extensively characterized is that of the Kv1 (Shaker) class (3.Chandy K.G.

Thus, K+ channels exhibit a considerable potential for diversity, the basis for which has only begun to emerge. Important clues to the physiological roles of K+ channel diversity have come from observations that discrete K+ channel complexes have unique spatio-temporal patterns of expression in discrete brain regions and even within individual neurons (11.Sheng M.

Thus, it seems that K+ channel diversity provides a powerful means for neurons to tailor voltage-dependent K+ efflux to the specific requirements of discrete functional compartments.

How neurons concentrate specific K+ channels into select compartments is unclear but it must involve their segregation and maintenance to prevent their free diffusion throughout the lipid bilayer (14.Sheng M.

Important clues have come from the recent identification of a family of proteins termed MAGUKS1(membrane-associated guanylatekinases), that are concentrated and thought to organize proteins, in specific compartments such as tight junctions in epithelia and synapses in neurons (14.Sheng M.

Nature. 1995; 378: 85-88Crossref PubMed Scopus (892) Google Scholar). Among the most widely studied MAGUKs is the PSD-95 (postsynaptic density-95) subfamily (14.Sheng M. Wyszynski M. Bioessays. 1997; 19: 847-853Crossref PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar) whose members (e.g. PSD-95 and SAP-97) induce the clustering of proteins including Kv1 channels. Clustering appears to require two sets of interactions. First, there is direct binding of PSD-95 via protein-protein interaction modules termed PDZ (14.Sheng M. Wyszynski M. Bioessays. 1997; 19: 847-853Crossref PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar) domains to proteins, such as Kv1, that contain a specific peptide motif (T/S-X-V) at the distal ends of their carboxyl termini (18.Kim E. Niethammer M. Rothschild A. Jan Y.N. Sheng M. Nature. 1995; 378: 85-88Crossref PubMed Scopus (892) Google Scholar,19.Doyle D.A. Lee A. Lewis J. Kim E. Sheng M. MacKinnon R. Cell. 1996; 85: 1067-1076Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (953) Google Scholar). Second, there is self-association of PSD-95 (18.Kim E. Niethammer M. Rothschild A. Jan Y.N. Sheng M. Nature. 1995; 378: 85-88Crossref PubMed Scopus (892) Google Scholar, 20.Craven S.E. El-Husseini A.E. Bredt D.S.

Neuron. 1997; 18: 803-814Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (183) Google Scholar). Significantly, the membrane protein binding and PSD-95 self-association events can be dissociated since PSD-95 mutants lacking PDZ domains can self-associate. Moreover, membrane protein binding is unaffected by the deletion of a pair of NH2-terminal cysteine residues required for PSD-95 multimerization (21.Hsueh Y.P. Kim E. Sheng M. Neuron. 1997; 18: 803-814Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (183) Google Scholar, 22.Hsueh Y.P. Sheng M. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 532-536Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). The recent demonstration that PSD-95 mediates the clustering and immobilization of Kv1.4 in live cells (23.Burke N.A. Takimoto K. Li D. Han W. Watkins S.C. Levitan E.S. J. Gen. Physiol. 1999; 113: 71-80Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar) provides further compelling evidence that PSD-95-type interactions are key determinants of the spatial distribution of Kv1 channels. However, alternative or additional modes may exist through which PSD-95 specifies membrane protein segregation. One mode that may be especially pertinent to neurons is via the regulation of membrane protein endocytosis or internalization (which describes surface channel depletion when both endocytosis and recycling occur (for definitions see Ref. 24.Koenig J.A. Edwardson J.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 17174-17182Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar)) (25.Mukherjee S. Ghosh R.N. Maxfield F.R. Physiol. Rev. 1997; 77: 759-803Crossref PubMed Scopus (1284) Google Scholar). Differential rates of membrane protein endocytosis between cell regions would be a powerful means for defining their subcellular distribution and indirectly shaping the electrophysiology of the neuron (26.Parton R.G. Dotti C.G. J. Neurosci. Res. 1993; 36: 1-9Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar, 27.Bailey C.H. Chen M. Keller F. Kandel E.R. Science. 1992; 256: 645-649Crossref PubMed Scopus (283) Google Scholar). Powerful support for this hypothesis has come from studies showing differences in endocytosis between axons and dendrites (28.Parton R.G. Simons K. Dotti C.G. J. Cell Biol. 1992; 119: 123-137Crossref PubMed Scopus (220) Google Scholar) and observations that endocytosis can determine, selectively, the expression of ion channels at the cell surface in both epithelia (29.Shimkets R.A. Lifton R.P. Canessa C.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 25537-25541Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (242) Google Scholar) and neurons (30.Liu J. Bangalore R. Rutledge A. Triggle D.J. Mol. Pharmacol. 1994; 45: 1198-1206PubMed Google Scholar, 31.Dargent B. Jullien F. Couraud F. Neurochem. 1995; 65: 407-413Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). Indeed there is now direct evidence that the activation of endocytosis is pivotal in synaptic plasticity and may cause the redistribution of proteins to sites of synaptogenesis (27.Bailey C.H. Chen M. Keller F. Kandel E.R. Science. 1992; 256: 645-649Crossref PubMed Scopus (283) Google Scholar). We have, therefore, hypothesized that an important role for PSD-95, in addition to segregating ion channels through clustering is to selectively stabilize (or destabilize) clustered channels at the cell surface by modulating their rates of endocytosis. To test our hypothesis, we have determined the rate of internalization of Kv1.4 K+ channels in the presence and absence of PSD-95. We now show that when Kv1.4 is expressed alone in HEK293 (human embryonic kidney) cells it is internalized from the cell surface with at 12 of 87 min. However, upon co-transfection with cDNAs encoding PSD-95, internalization of Kv1.4 is ablated. The ability of PSD-95 to impede Kv1.4 internalization is a direct function of its capacity for mediating Kv1.4 clustering since a PSD-95 mutant, C35S-PSD-95, which retains its ability to bind, but not cluster, allows Kv1.4 to be internalized rapidly. Surprisingly, the rate of internalization of Kv1.4 in the presence of C35S-PSD-95 is much faster (t 12 of 16 min) than for Kv1.4 alone, suggesting the presence of undisclosed internalization motifs or mechanisms in PSD-95 (or its complex with Kv1.4). These data reveal an entirely new role for PSD-95 and channel clustering, and add weight to the notion that ion channel targeting may, in part, be conferred by regional differences in the stabilization of ion channel expression at the cell surface. A clone encoding myc-tagged PSD-95 in the expression vector pGW1-CMV was a generous gift of Dr. M. Sheng (Harvard University, Boston, MA). Anti-PSD-95 monoclonal antibody was purchased from Transduction Laboratories, Lexington, KY. The appropriate secondary antibodies conjugated to horseradish peroxidase were purchased from Amersham Pharmacia Biotech. Oligonucleotide primers were synthesized by the University of Toronto/Hospital for Sick Children Biotechnologies Services (Toronto, ON, Canada) or ACGT Inc. (Toronto, ON, Canada). All other chemicals were of reagent grade or higher. The Kv1.4 mammalian expression vectors were constructed via the polymerase chain reaction (PCR) using, as template, first strand cDNA synthesized from rat cortex (Fast Track, Stratagene, San Diego, CA). First, a Kv1.4 “core” cDNA encoding the NH2 terminus to transmembrane spanning segment S6 (amino acids M (1.Miller C. Science. 1991; 252: 1092-1096Crossref PubMed Scopus (194) Google Scholar)-P (577)) was PCR-amplified using the following oligonucleotide primers: 5′-GCGTCATCATCAGACCGCATC-3′ and 5′-AAATTTCCCGGGCAAAGCAATGGTTAAGAC-3′ which also served to introduce a 3′ SmaI site for subcloning. A second cDNA encoding the Kv1.4 “COOH terminus” (amino acids V (578)-V (655)), was generated likewise using the following oligonucleotide primers: 5′-AAATTTTACGTA CCGGTGATTGTGTCTAACTTT-3′ and 5′-AAGTCTCTCTCGGGCTTCAGC-3′ which also introduce a 5′ SnaBI site. The resulting PCR products were then subcloned into pCRII (Invitrogen, San Diego, CA). The Kv1.4 core was then excised from pCRII using EcoRI andSmaI, and ligated into the corresponding sites in the mammalian expression vector pSVK3 (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech, Baie d'Urfe, PQ, Canada). To complete the Kv1.4 expression vector, the Kv1.4 COOH terminus was excised from pCRII using SnaBI andApaI, and ligated into the corresponding sites of the Kv1.4core-pSVK3 vector. An EYFP (extendedyellow variant of green fluorescentprotein)-tagged Kv1.4 cDNA was constructed by PCR using the Kv1.4-pSVK3 vector as template and the following primers: 5′-TTTAAGCTTCTATGGAGGTGGCAATG-3′ and 5′-GGCACAATTCCCAAC-3′. The PCR product was then digested with HindIII and HincII and ligated into the HindIII and SmaI sites of pEYFP-C1 (CLONTECH, Palo Alto, CA). A PSD-95 mutant lacking cysteine residues at positions 3 and 5 was constructed by PCR using as template myc-tagged PSD-95 in the expression vector pGW1-CMV. The mutagenic primer (5′-AAAGAATTCATGGACTCTCTCTCTATAGTGACA-3′) corresponded to the first 24 nucleotides of PSD-95 coding sequence together with G to C substitutions (underlined) at the second position of the cysteine-3 or cysteine-5 codons and an EcoRI site for subcloning. The reverse primer was 5′-TTTCTCGAGTTTTCAGAGTCTCTC-3′ and included the stop codon and anXhoI site for cloning. The identity of the constructs was confirmed by restriction mapping and DNA sequencing (U.S. Biochemical Sequenase V2.0 or ACGT Inc., Toronto, ON). HEK293 were obtained from American Type Culture Collection (Manassas, VA) and grown at 37 °C, 95% O2, 5% CO2 in minimal essential medium (Life Technologies, Inc., Oakville, ON), supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum, penicillin (10 μg/ml), and streptomycin (10 units/μl). Transient transfections were performed via lipofection of HEK293 cultures. Briefly, cells were seeded directly on 35-mm plastic culture dishes (day 0), allowed to grow to confluency (day 2–5), and then transfected with fresh LipofectAMINE (Life Technologies, Inc.) (2 μg of DNA, 8 μg of LipofectAMINE reagent/dish), diluted into minimal essential medium (500 μl). After standing for 5 h, the transfection medium was replaced with normal medium, and again at 24 h following the start of the transfection. At no time during the experiment were the cells exposed to antimitotic or antibacterial agents. The transfection efficiency was >65%. Cell surface labeling of glycoproteins was performed using a version of the periodate-biotinylation assay described by Prince et al. (32.Prince L.S. Tousson A. Marchase R.B. Am. J. Physiol. 1993; 264: C491-C498Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). All procedures were conducted at 4 °C except where indicated. Briefly, at 48 h post-transfection, HEK293 cells were chilled to 4 °C, washed with ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline containing 0.1 mmCaCl2 and 1 mm MgCl2 (PBS-CM), and incubated with 20 mm NaIO4 in PBS-CM for 30 min in the dark, to oxidize cell surface carbohydrate residues. After re-washing with PBS-CM, fresh pre-warmed minimal essential medium was added to the cells and they were returned to the incubator to allow internalization to proceed. At specified times (t = 0 to 320 min) the cells were re-washed with ice-cold PBS-CM and labeled with 2 mm biotin-LC-hydrazide in 100 mm sodium acetate (pH 5.5) for 30 min in the dark. The cells were then re-washed with PBS-CM and lysed in 100 μl of lysis buffer (20 mmHEPES, 150 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 1% (v/v) Nonidet P-40, pH 7.4), supplemented with the protease inhibitors aprotinin (100 μg/ml), leupeptin (100 μg/ml), and phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride (2 mm). An HEK293 soluble membrane fraction was made by shearing HEK293 cell lysates 8× with an 18-gauge needle, and centrifuging at 12,000 × g av for 3 min to remove insoluble material. Rat brain membranes were prepared as described (33.Jones O.T. Bernstein G.M. Jones E.J. Jugloff D.G. Law M. Wong W. Mills L.R. J. Neurosci. 1997; 17: 6152-6164Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Membranes for biotinylated protein isolation were used immediately, all others were frozen and stored in liquid N2. Membrane protein concentrations were determined via a commercial kit (DC Protein Assay, Bio-Rad). Biotinylated proteins were isolated by incubating solubilized HEK293 membranes (40 μg of protein) with streptavidin-agarose (160 μl of 50% slurry) (Molecular Probes, Eugene, OR) pre-equilibrated in lysis buffer. After rocking the reaction mixtures gently for 12–16 h at 4 °C, biotin-streptavidin-agarose complexes were harvested by centrifugation, washed three times with a 20-fold excess of lysis buffer, and once with 10 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.0), 300 mm NaCl. The beads were then resuspended in 75 μl of SDS sample buffer and boiled for 5 min prior to SDS-PAGE. A peptide corresponding to residues N (14.Sheng M. Wyszynski M. Bioessays. 1997; 19: 847-853Crossref PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar)-R (37.Barry P.H. Lynch J.W. J. Membr. Biol. 1991; 121: 101-117Crossref PubMed Scopus (580) Google Scholar) of Kv1.4 (34.Stuhmer W. Ruppersberg J.P. Schroter K.H. Sakmann B. Stocker M. Giese K.P. Perschke A. Baumann A. Pongs O. EMBO J. 1989; 8: 3235-3244Crossref PubMed Scopus (613) Google Scholar) (GenBank accession number P15385), plus a COOH-terminal cysteine for coupling, was synthesized by Vetrogen (London, ON, Canada). The identity of the peptide was confirmed by amino acid analysis and mass spectroscopy. Kv1.4 peptide was coupled to keyhole limpet hemocyanin with the cross-linkerm-maleimidobenzoyl-N-hydroxysulfosuccinimide ester (Pierce) and the conjugate dialyzed against PBS. New Zealand White rabbits were immunized with the conjugate (Division of Comparative Medicine, University of Toronto) and antisera were collected and the IgG fraction was enriched using protein A affinity chromatography (MAPS kit, Bio-Rad, Mississauga, ON, Canada). Protein samples were heated in SDS sample buffer and the proteins resolved by electrophoresis on 7.5% SDS-polyacrylamide gels (35.Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (205531) Google Scholar). The proteins were transferred electrophoretically to nitrocellulose and immunoblotted as described previously (33.Jones O.T. Bernstein G.M. Jones E.J. Jugloff D.G. Law M. Wong W. Mills L.R. J. Neurosci. 1997; 17: 6152-6164Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) using the following primary antibody conditions: Kv1.4, 1:250 of 4 μg/μl, 1 h; PSD-95, 1:250 of 0.25 μg/μl, 1 h. Blots were incubated with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibodies at 1:2500–4000 for 2 h. Immunoreactive proteins were detected by enhanced chemiluminescence (ECL; Amersham Pharmacia Biotech, Oakville, ON, Canada) and quantified with a Bio-Rad Model GS-670 imaging densitometer. For display, exposed films were digitized via a StudioScan IIsi scanner (AGFA, Toronto, ON, Canada) using FotoLook PS2.07.2 software (Adobe Systems, Mountainview, CA). Digitized images were cropped, using Photoshop 4.0 software (Adobe Systems) and displayed without any further processing. The functional expression of Kv1.4 and EYFP-Kv1.4 in transfected HEK293 cells was assessed through whole cell patch clamp recordings (Axopatch 200A, Axon Instruments) (36.Schlichter L.C. Sakellaropoulos G. Ballyk B. Pennefather P.S. Phipps D.J. Glia. 1996; 17: 225-236Crossref PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar). Recordings were obtained 48 h after transfection on cells of simple morphology lacking contacts with surrounding cells. The internal pipette solution (300–310 mOsm) contained (in mm): 110 KCl, 5 BAPTA (tetra-potassium salt), 2 K2-ATP, 2 MgCl2, and 10 HEPES, adjusted to pH 7.2 with KOH. The bathing solution (320–330 mOsm) contained (in mm): 145 NaCl, 10 glucose, 4 KCl, 1.8 CaCl2, 1 MgCl2, and 10 HEPES, adjusted with NaOH to pH 7.35. Pipettes were pulled from borosilicate glass (World Precision Instruments, Sarasota, FL) and had resistance of 8–10 megaohm when filled with internal solution. All voltages were corrected to account for the junction potentials between bath, pipette, and agar bridge solutions (37.Barry P.H. Lynch J.W. J. Membr. Biol. 1991; 121: 101-117Crossref PubMed Scopus (580) Google Scholar). Voltages were applied and currents recorded using pCLAMP software (Ver. 6.0, Axon Instruments) and a Tecmar Labmaster data acquisition board. Analog subtraction was used to cancel capacitative transients during data acquisition. Currents were filtered at 5 KHz and the series resistance was compensated 50–70%. The time courses for activation and inactivation were calculated from nonlinear least squares fitting to Hodgkin-Huxley type n4j kinetics as described elsewhere (38.London B. Wang D.W. Hill J.A. Bennett P.B. J. Physiol. 1998; 509.1: 171-182Crossref Scopus (97) Google Scholar). Digital EYFP-Kv1.4 images were captured on an inverted scanning confocal microscope (Bio-Rad MRC-600) equipped with an argon ion laser, using fluorescein optics as detailed previously (33.Jones O.T. Bernstein G.M. Jones E.J. Jugloff D.G. Law M. Wong W. Mills L.R. J. Neurosci. 1997; 17: 6152-6164Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Unless otherwise specified all data are given as mean ± S.E. for n trials and analysis was done using Sigma Plot V.4.0 (Jandel, CA) or Origin 5.0 (Microcal, CT) software. To resolve the internalization of Kv1.4 in detail, we first raised specific polyclonal antibodies against an intracellular sequence corresponding to residues 14–37 of the Kv1.4 amino terminus (34.Stuhmer W. Ruppersberg J.P. Schroter K.H. Sakmann B. Stocker M. Giese K.P. Perschke A. Baumann A. Pongs O. EMBO J. 1989; 8: 3235-3244Crossref PubMed Scopus (613) Google Scholar) (Fig. 1 A) that has previously been used successfully for this purpose (11.Sheng M. Tsaur M.L. Jan Y.N. Jan L.Y. Neuron. 1992; 9: 271-284Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (398) Google Scholar). High titer antisera from rabbits immunized with this synthetic peptide recognized a band of 90 kDa in immunoblots of rat brain membranes (Fig.1 B, lane 1) that could be eliminated by pretreatment of the Kv1.4 antiserum with competing antigenic peptide (Fig. 1 B, lane 2). Although this band is similar in size to that found previously in brain (11.Sheng M. Tsaur M.L. Jan Y.N. Jan L.Y. Neuron. 1992; 9: 271-284Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (398) Google Scholar), it is somewhat higher than that anticipated from the published sequence (73 kDa). To obtain further evidence for the specificity of the Kv1.4 antibody we therefore analyzed immunoblots of lysates of HEK293 cells transfected with cDNAs encoding Kv1.4. As shown in Fig. 1 C, lane 1, our Kv1.4 antibody recognized a band of 76 kDa that is absent upon preincubation of the antibody with competing antigenic peptide (lane 2) or in lysates from mock-transfected HEK293 cells (lane 3). The absence of Kv1.4 in untransfected HEK293 cells is not surprising based on previous electrophysiology (23.Burke N.A. Takimoto K. Li D. Han W. Watkins S.C. Levitan E.S. J. Gen. Physiol. 1999; 113: 71-80Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar, 39.Kupper J. Eur. J. Neurosci. 1998; 10: 3908-3912Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). However, the expression of significant levels of endogenous PSD-95 could seriously complicate the analysis of its role in the endocytosis of Kv1.4. We therefore examined the levels of PSD-95 in HEK293 cells before and after transfection with a mammalian expression vector encoding PSD-95, tagged with a functionally inert c-myc epitope (22.Hsueh Y.P. Sheng M. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 532-536Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). Immunoblots of rat cortical membranes probed with a commercial antibody against PSD-95 (Fig.1 D, lane 1) disclosed a band of ∼95 kDa as reported (18.Kim E. Niethammer M. Rothschild A. Jan Y.N. Sheng M. Nature. 1995; 378: 85-88Crossref PubMed Scopus (892) Google Scholar,22.Hsueh Y.P. Sheng M. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 532-536Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). While a band of identical size was present in lysates of PSD-95-transfected HEK293 cells (lane 2), this band was absent from untransfected cells run under identical conditions (lane 3). To observe the internalization of Kv1.4, we utilized a two-step periodation/biotinylation assay to distinguish proteins present on the cell surface from those within the cytoplasm (32.Prince L.S. Tousson A. Marchase R.B. Am. J. Physiol. 1993; 264: C491-C498Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 40.Lisanti M.P. Le Bivic A. Sargiacomo M. Rodriguez-Boulan E. J. Cell Biol. 1989; 109: 2117-2127Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar). The basis of this assay lies in the conversion of sugar diols present within cell surface glycoproteins such as Kv1.4 (6.Sheng M. Liao Y.J. Jan Y.N. Jan L.Y. Nature. 1993; 365: 72-75Crossref PubMed Scopus (288) Google Scholar), to reactive aldehydes, by the mild, cell impermeant, oxidant sodium periodate. The extent of internalization following oxidation is then deduced from the disappearance of the aldehydic sites available to react with aldehyde-specific, non-permeable labels such as biotin hydrazide. To confirm the specificity of the internalization assay, we examined the cell-surface biotinylation of Kv1.4 expressed in transfected HEK293 cells. Following periodate oxidation and biotin hydrazide labeling, biotinylated proteins were harvested from cell lysates by affinity precipitation with streptavidin-agarose. The precipitates were then analyzed by SDS-PAGE and immunoblotting with Kv1.4 antibody (Fig.2). In experimental samples two immunoreactive bands were apparent, the first corresponding to a band of 77 kDa, as anticipated (lane 1) and a second lower band of 71 kDa. Omission of both periodate oxidation and biotinylation (lane 2), just the oxidation (lane 3), or just the biotinylation (lane 4) steps led to the disappearance of the upper, presumptive Kv1.4 band but not the lower band. Together these data suggest that Kv1.4 immunoreactivity is unaffected by the two-step procedure and support the validity of this assay as a way to detect cell surface Kv1.4 in transfected HEK293 cells. Using the two-step periodate-biotin hydrazide assay we analyzed the expression of Kv1.4 at the cell surface of HEK293 with or without PSD-95. To preclude variability between transfected dishes the band intensities for cell surface Kv1.4 (obtained from the streptavidin-agarose precipitates) were normalized with respect to the total level of Kv1.4 in each cell lysate (obtained by direct analysis of an aliquot of cell lysate) (32.Prince L.S. Tousson A. Marchase R.B. Am. J. Physiol. 1993; 264: C491-C498Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Such variability arose, primarily, through cell losses during the wash steps rather than differences in transfection efficiency or plated cell density. In the absence of PSD-95 (Fig.3 A, i), the expression of Kv1.4 at the cell surface declined rapi"

It is a homo-oligomer of a protein comprising two transmembrane segments connected by an external loop, with the NH2 and COOH termini located in the cytoplasm. The contributions of the extramembranous domains of the channel to its activity were investigated by specific proteolysis during patch-clamp experiments. Limited proteolysis of the COOH terminus or the NH2 terminus increased the mechanosensitivity of the channel without changing its conductance. Strikingly, after cleavage of the external loop of each monomer, the channel was still functional, and its mechanosensitivity was increased dramatically, indicating that the loop acts as a spring that resists the opening of the channel and promotes its closure when it is open. These results indicate that the integrity of most of the extramembranous domains is not essential for mechanosensitivity. They suggest that these domains counteract the movement of the transmembrane helices to which they are connected, thus setting the level of sensitivity of the channel to tension.

Since their discovery by patch-clamp experiments (1.Guharay F. Sachs F. J. Physiol. 1984; 352: 685-701Crossref PubMed Scopus (718) Google Scholar, 2.Brehm P. Kullberg R. Moody-Corbett F. J.

These channels gate in response to changes in membrane tension and are present in animal cells as well as in plant cells and bacteria (3.Morris C.E. J. Membr.

The situation in this ion channel field has thus been in sharp contrast with that known for voltage-gated or ligand-gated channels for which a wealth of information is available today. High conductance ion channels that are stretch-activated are present in Gram-negative and Gram-positive bacteria (8.Sukharev S.I. Blount P. Martinac B. Kung C. Annu. Rev.

In Escherichia coli, patch-clamp experiments have revealed stretch-activated conductances ranging from 100 to 1,500 picosiemens (in 0.1 m KCl). By order of increasing conductances, three families of Msc can be distinguished: MscM (M for mini), MscS (S for small), and MscL (L for large) (14.Berrier C. Besnard M. Ajouz B. Coulombe A. Ghazi A. J. Membr. Biol. 1996; 151: 175-187Crossref PubMed Scopus (166) Google Scholar). Prokaryotic Msc can be solubilized in detergent and functionally reconstituted in giant liposomes amenable to patch-clamp recording. This property has allowed purification of MscL, the channel of the highest conductance, and cloning of its corresponding gene,mscL (15.Sukharev S.I. Blount P. Martinac B. Blattner F.R. Kung C. Nature. 1994; 368: 265-268Crossref PubMed Scopus (590) Google Scholar). Expression of the mscL gene was shown to be necessary and sufficient for the activity of this channel (15.Sukharev S.I.

Chem. 1998; 273: 14667-14670Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar) suggested that the functional channel is a homohexamer. Recently, three-dimensional crystals of the MscL homolog from Mycobacterium tuberculosis were obtained (19.Chang G. Spencer R.H. Lee A.T. Barclay M.T. Rees D.C. Science. 1998; 282: 2220-2226Crossref PubMed Scopus (858) Google Scholar), allowing a determination by x-ray crystallography of its structure in the closed conformation to 3.5 Å resolution. In the crystal, the channel is organized as a homopentamer. Each subunit comprises two transmembrane segments connected by an external periplasmic loop, with the NH2 and COOH termini located in the cytoplasm. The closed pore is lined by the five M1 helices (on the NH2-terminal side) tilted at an oblique angle with respect to the membrane. The M2 helix returns to the cytoplasm along the outside of the closed pore. The COOH-terminal cytoplasmic domain consists of helices packed together to form a helical bundle. Because MscL is the first purified protein with unambiguous mechanosensitive activity, whose gene is available and whose structure is known, it becomes a model system to study the molecular mechanism of mechanosensation. It is a very simple system: an oligomer of a small protein which is able to change its conformation in response to a variation in membrane tension. However, despite this simplicity, its molecular mechanism is still unknown. In this study, we have examined the contributions of the NH2 and COOH termini and the external loop of the channel to its mechanosensitivity. This was achieved by proteolysis of these extramembranous domains (Fig. 1) during patch-clamp experiments performed on the native membrane or in liposomes in which the purified protein was reconstituted. We could demonstrate that limited proteolysis of either the COOH terminus or the NH2 terminus increased the mechanosensitivity of the channel. Importantly, the channel remained functional after cleavage of the only external loop of each subunit, such that its mechanosensitivity was increased dramatically. The results are interpreted within the framework of a molecular model for the gating mechanism of MscL. Giant E. coli protoplasts for which the plasma membrane is accessible to a patch electrode were prepared form E. coli lpp ompA − cells (14.Berrier C. Besnard M. Ajouz B. Coulombe A. Ghazi A. J. Membr. Biol. 1996; 151: 175-187Crossref PubMed Scopus (166) Google Scholar). Cells were grown in 50 ml of LB, pH 7.2, supplemented with 30 mm MgSO4 to an OD650 of 0.12–0.15 before the addition of cephalexin (60 μg/ml). Giant round cells (5–7 μm in diameter) were harvested 3–4 h later. Cells resuspended in 10 mm Tris-HCl buffer, pH 7, 100 mm NaCl, 400 mm sucrose, were incubated at 37 °C for 30 min in the presence of lysozyme (400 μg/ml). 2 μl of this suspension was deposited in the patch-clamp chamber and covered with 50 μl of 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7, 1 mmEDTA, 100 mm KCl. 2 ml of 10 mm HEPES-KOH, pH 7.4, 100 mm KCl, 10 mm MgCl2 was then added to the patch-clamp chamber for recording. Recombinant MscL proteins and mutant (Δ110–136) proteins were purified in one step, using a glutathione S-transferase fusion system, as described previously (16.Häse C.C. Le Dain A.C. Martinac B. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 18329-18334Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (167) Google Scholar). A few microliters of purified protein in 50 mm octyl β-d-glucoside was added to 1 ml of 10 mm HEPES-KOH, pH 7.4, 100 mm KCl, 25 mm octyl β-d-glucoside containing 1 mg of sonicated lipids (azolectin from soybean, type IV-S, Sigma) to achieve a lipid to protein ratio of 500–2,500. After a 20-min incubation, 160 mg wet weight of SM-2 Bio-Beads (Bio-Rad) was added to the suspension to remove the detergent (20.Rigaud J.-L. Paternostre M.-T. Bluzat A. Biochemistry. 1988; 27: 2677-2688Crossref PubMed Scopus (233) Google Scholar). The suspension was agitated for 3 h, the Bio-Beads were discarded, and the suspension was centrifuged for 30 min at 90,000 rpm using a TL100 Beckman ultracentrifuge. The pellet was resuspended in 15 μl of 10 mm HEPES-KOH, pH 7.4. The proteoliposomes were then fused into giant proteoliposomes amenable to patch-clamp recording, using a cycle of dehydration-rehydration as described previously (21.Berrier C. Coulombe A. Houssin C. Ghazi A. FEBS Lett. 1989; 259: 27-32Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar). Rehydration was performed in 10 mm HEPES-KOH, pH 7.4, 100 mm KCl. 2 μl of the giant proteoliposome suspension was deposited in the patch-clamp chamber and diluted with 2 ml of the bath solution for electrophysiological recording. Single-channel activity was measured using the methods of Hamill et al. (22.Hamill O.P. Marty A. Neher E. Sakmann B. Sigworth F.J. Pflügers Arch. Eur. J. Physiol. 1981; 391: 85-100Crossref PubMed Scopus (15148) Google Scholar). Patch electrodes were pulled from Pyrex capillaries (Corning code 7740) and were not fire polished before use. Whether using cells or proteoliposomes, recordings were performed in the excised patch mode, and the internal face of the membrane patch could be superfused by solution coming from the outlet of a manifold connected to a series of five piped inlets, allowing easy change of solution. The flow rate of the solutions was 50–100 μl/min. Because a flow of solution can sometimes activate the channels by itself, the patch was always superfused with a control solution before application of protease. Trypsin (tosylphenylalanyl chloromethyl ketone-treated), chymotrypsin (N α-p-tosyl-l-lysine chloromethyl ketone-treated), carboxypeptidase Y (from baker's yeast), leucine aminopeptidase (from porcine kidney), and Pronase E fromStreptomyces griseus were from Sigma. Control experiments were performed using bovine serum albumin in the bath or in the pipette. Negative pressure (suction) in the pipette was applied by syringe and monitored with piezo-electric pressure transducer (Bioblock scientific). Unitary currents were recorded using a Biologic RK-300 patch-clamp amplifier with a 10-gigaohmsfeedback resistance and stored on digital audio tape (Biologic DTR 1200 DAT recorder). Records were subsequently filtered at 1 kHz (−3 dB point) through a four-pole Bessel low pass filter, digitized off-line at a rate of 2 kHz, and analyzed on a personal computer, with a program developed by G. Sadoc (Gif sur Yvette). Data were plotted on a Hewlett-Packard laserjet printer, using Sigmaplot software (Jandel). Open probability P o multiplied by the unknown number N of channels in a given patch, versus the applied suction, were fitted with a Boltzmann distribution of the formN⋅Po=N⋅Pmax(1+expα(p1/2−p)) −1Equation 1 where P max is the maximum probability of channel being open, p is the suction,p 1/2 is the suction at which the open probability is 0.5, and α is the sensitivity to the applied suction. For the native membrane as well as for proteoliposomes, the convention for the membrane potential is the same and assigns zero level to the pipette. The contents of all the pipette, bath, and perfusion solutions are given in the figure legends. The patch-clamp experiments were performed on giantE. coli protoplasts (Fig. 6B in Ref. 14.Berrier C. Besnard M. Ajouz B. Coulombe A. Ghazi A. J. Membr. Biol. 1996; 151: 175-187Crossref PubMed Scopus (166) Google Scholar). After excision, the inside-out patches were superfused with a control solution similar to the bath solution. Negative pressure (suction) was raised progressively until the activation of the MscL channels and was then kept constant. The control solution was then exchanged for a solution containing a protease. As shown in Fig.2, the superfusion of the patch by trypsin (250 μg/ml) led to a sudden increase in channel activity at constant pressure. However, the channels remained mechanosensitive and closed immediately upon release of pressure. This effect was observed in four experiments. A similar effect was observed when the patch was superfused with chymotrypsin (300 μg/ml) (n = 2) (data not shown). In both cases, the activation by proteases did not modify the unit conductance of the channels. When we attempted to study the effect of proteases on the periplasmic side by adding them to the pipette solution, the seals were highly unstable and were usually lost upon application of pressure so that no meaningful results could be obtained (but see below). The MscL proteins alone form the ion channel (15.Sukharev S.I. Blount P. Martinac B. Blattner F.R. Kung C. Nature. 1994; 368: 265-268Crossref PubMed Scopus (590) Google Scholar, 16.Häse C.C.

EMBO J. 1996; 15: 4798-4805Crossref PubMed Scopus (163) Google Scholar). However, it cannot be ruled out that in the plasma membrane it may interact with other proteins which could modulate its sensitivity. To examine whether the effects described above are caused by the action of the proteases acting on the channel itself or on other associated proteins, we turned to a reconstituted system. The purified MscL was reconstituted in liposomes which were fused, by dehydration-rehydration, into giant liposomes amenable to patch-clamp recording. A first concern in such studies is the orientation of the protein in the pure lipid bilayer compared with the native system. The MscL channel is weakly voltage- dependent. In the plasma membrane, at a given applied pressure, the channel tends to be more open at low positive potentials than at low negative potentials (14.Berrier C. Besnard M. Ajouz B. Coulombe A. Ghazi A. J. Membr. Biol. 1996; 151: 175-187Crossref PubMed Scopus (166) Google Scholar). A first hint that the proteins were reconstituted with the right side orientation came from the observation of a voltage dependence of the same polarity in liposomes as in the native membrane (not shown). This was confirmed further by the experiments described in this paper. After excision from a giant liposome, superfusion of the patch by trypsin (250 μg/ml) resulted in an effect similar to that described above for patches performed on the plasma membrane (n = 13). Examination of the amino acid sequence and topology of the MscL monomer indicated that sites sensitive to trypsin are present in both amino and carboxyl termini (Fig. 1). To test whether proteolysis of the COOH terminus modifies mechanosensitivity, we examined the effect of carboxypeptidase. As shown in Fig.3 A, superfusion of carboxypeptidase Y (500 μg/ml) first led to a transient decrease in channel activity (marked by an asterisk on the figure), which was systematically observed, followed by a rapid and significant increase in the channel activity (n = 12). There was no change in unit conductance. Importantly, independent of the length of time during which carboxypeptidase was superfused on the patch (up to 5 min), no loss of channel activity was ever observed. Similarly, as shown in Fig. 3 B, superfusion of the patch by chymotrypsin (300 μg/ml) led to a rapid increase in the activity of the channels, at constant applied pressure, without a change in unit conductance (n = 11). The potential chymotrypsin cleavage sites (aromatic residues) are present in the NH2 terminus (Fig.1). However, hydrophobic residues, which are weaker potential targets for chymotrypsin, are present in the COOH terminus. We therefore tested the effect of aminopeptidase. As shown in Fig. 3 C, superfusion of the patch by aminopeptidase (500 μg/ml) also led to an increase in the channel open probability at constant applied pressure (n = 6). Taken as a whole these experiments indicate that limited proteolysis of either the COOH or the NH2terminus of the channel increased its sensitivity to pressure. In all cases, the channels remained mechanosensitive and could be closed and reopened at will upon decrease or increase of applied pressure. Previous studies led to the conclusion that most of the COOH-terminal extension plays no role in mechanosensitivity. Indeed, a mutant (Δ110–136), in which the last 27 residues had been deleted, was still functional, whereas deletion of 6 additional residues suppressed channel activity totally (23.Blount P. Sukharev S.I. Shroeder M.J. Nagle S.K. Kung C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 11652-11657Crossref PubMed Scopus (181) Google Scholar, 24.Häse C.C. Le Dain A.C. Martinac B. J. Membr. Biol. 1997; 157: 17-25Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). The mechanosensitivity of the Δ110–136 mutant was reported to be similar to that of the wild type. We reconstituted the purified Δ110–136 mutant in giant liposomes. The threshold of activation was not modified, but the slope of the activation curve was enhanced considerably compared with the wild type. Superfusion of excised patches by carboxypeptidase led nevertheless to an increase in channel activity at constant applied pressure (n = 3, not shown). Taken together, these results indicate that deletion of residues of the COOH terminus before and after residue 110 modulates the mechanosensitivity of the channel. We examined the effect of proteases on channel open probabilityversus applied pressure described by a Boltzmann distribution. In general, the pressure required for half-activation (where P o = 0.5) varied from patch to patch. The open probability was thus first determined before protease treatment, by application of pressure increased stepwise every 15 s. The protease was then superfused on the gating channels for 5–7 min, the patch was washed with control solution, and increased pressure was applied again for the open probability determination (Fig.4, A, B,C, and F). In control conditions, a full curve could not always be obtained because of the fear of breaking the patch. Nevertheless, a clear shift of the curve to lower pressures was observed after treatment either by trypsin or chymotrypsin, or carboxypeptidase, or chymotrypsin followed by carboxypeptidase. This shift was a result of both a decrease in the pressure required for half-activation and an increase of the sensitivity of the channel to membrane tension. The effect was more pronounced after the action of both chymotrypsin and carboxypeptidase. Furthermore, we examined whether chymotrypsin or carboxypeptidase was effective when applied to closed channels. After application of increased pressure to the patch under control conditions, pressure was released to close the channels, and the protease was superfused for 5–7 min. The patch was then washed with the control solution, and the open probability at different pressures was determined again. As shown in Fig. 4, D and E, both chymotrypsin and carboxypeptidase were able to induce a shift of the curve to lower pressure, indicating that they are active on closed channels as well. Outside-out patches cannot be obtained with giant proteoliposomes. To examine the effects of a protease on the outside of a patch, the protease was added to the pipette solution. After seal formation and excision of the patch, pressure was applied rapidly until activation of the channels. The pressure was kept constant, and the channel activity was monitored. Increase in channel activity was observed when chymotrypsin (300 μg/ml) or trypsin (250 μg/ml) was present in the pipette, but an upward drift of the baseline was observed upon application of the pressure. Reduction of trypsin or chymotrypsin concentration to 50 and 60 μg/ml, respectively, completely suppressed the mechanical instability of the patches. Under these conditions, we observed either with trypsin (n = 33) (Fig.5 A) or chymotrypsin (n = 5) (Fig. 5 B) an increase in channel activity at constant pressure, without a change in channel unit conductance. After 1 or 2 min, the channels became exquisitely sensitive to pressure, and application of pressure as low as 3–5 mm Hg was in general sufficient to activate the channels. In two cases, the channels were even observed to gate at apparent zero applied pressure. However, the channels remained mechanosensitive in that decrease (or increase) of pressure always resulted in a decrease (or increase) in open probability. We never observed, for instance, a permanently open level, within 20 min of continuous recording. A similar activation of the channels was also observed when Pronase (250 μg/ml), which has no specificity, was present in the pipette (n = 4). Importantly, when control experiments were performed with carboxypeptidase (500 μg/ml) in the pipette, no activation of the channels was observed (n = 9) (Fig. 5 C, compare with Fig. 3 A). We next examined how the presence of trypsin or chymotrypsin in the pipette affects the relationship between channel open probability and applied pressure. As shown in Fig.6 A, both proteases induce a dramatic shift of the activation curve reflected in a decrease pressure required for half-activation and a significant increase in the sensitivity of the channel to membrane tension. Moreover, the presence of trypsin or chymotrypsin or Pronase in the pipette drastically altered the channel open time. Fig. 6 B, which displays successive segments of recordings obtained after seal formation, in the presence of trypsin in the pipette, shows how the channel open time increased progressively with time.Figure 6Proteolysis of the external part of the channel alters its pressure dependence and drastically modifies its kinetics. Panel A, open probabilityP o versus the applied pressure, at fixed membrane potential (+10 mV), of the MscL channel after activation by trypsin (50 μg/ml) (circles) or chymotrypsin (60 μg/ml) (squares) present in the pipette. After seal formation, pressure was applied, and the activation of the channels was monitored for 10 min until a steady state was reached. The open probability at each applied pressure was then determined. Each point was obtained by integrating the current through open channels in a 15-s segment of recording and by dividing the integral by the time of recording multiplied by the unitary current and the total number of channels in the patch. The data were fitted to a Boltzmann distribution as defined in Fig. 5. After the action of trypsin,p 1/2 was 5 mm Hg, and 1/α was 0.4 mm Hg. After the action of chymotrypsin, p 1/2 was 7.3 mm Hg, and 1/α was 0.4 mm Hg. The broken line represents the Boltzmann distribution obtained by averaging the parameters of all of the control curves (in the absence of proteases) displayed in Fig. 5(p 1/2 = 67 mm Hg; 1/α = 4.85 mm Hg).Panel B, trypsin in the pipette altered the channel kinetics, increasing the open time. Successive segments of recordings were obtained at different times, as indicated, following seal formation and excision of the patch, with 50 μg/ml trypsin in the pipette. For each segment, only the amount of pressure necessary to activate one open channel level was applied.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Trypsin or chymotrypsin in the pipette was effective on gating channels but not on closed channels. In a typical experiment in which trypsin was present in the pipette, after excision of the patch, pressure was increased progressively until, at 50 mm Hg, the channels started to gate with a fast kinetics. Pressure was then released immediately to close the channels. After 10 min, pressure was applied again. The channels started to gate at 46 mm Hg. The channel kinetics was similar to that of control experiments characterized by short openings. Pressure was maintained, and the channel activity increased rapidly. After 2 min, the threshold of activation dropped to 3 mm Hg, and the channel kinetics exhibited characteristic long open times (not shown). This type of experiment was repeated four times with trypsin and two times with chymotrypsin with a similar result. We also incubated the giant proteoliposomes for 20 min in a bath containing 50 μg/ml trypsin. The liposomes were then patched with pipettes that contained no trypsin. Under these conditions, the threshold of activation for the channels was always relatively high (between 25 and 60 mm Hg), as in control experiments. The long open times were not observed. Finally we looked for the effects of proteases on both sides of the channel. The full effect of trypsin, present in the pipette, was observed. After that, chymotrypsin was perfused in the bath, followed by carboxypeptidase. A further slight enhancement in the activity of the channels was always observed after perfusion of the proteases in the bath. However, the channels always remained mechanosensitive; a permanently open level was never observed. In this study we examined the effect of different proteases on the mechanosensitivity of MscL either in the native membrane or in a reconstituted system. Our results indicated that MscL had the same orientation in the plasma membrane as in giant liposomes. This conclusion is based on the following findings. First, trypsin or chymotrypsin, when present in the pipette, activated the reconstituted channels in a different manner than when perfused in the bath. Second, carboxypeptidase activated the reconstituted channels when it was perfused in the bath, but not when it was present in the pipette. Therefore, in patch-clamp experiments performed on the plasma membrane and on giant liposomes, the amino and carboxyl termini were accessible from the bath, whereas the periplasmic loop faced the pipette. Because, with the reconstituted system, all experiments always yielded identical results, we concluded that MscL was in all cases reconstituted with the native orientation in giant liposomes. The experiments performed by applying proteases in the bath clearly indicate that limited proteolysis of either the NH2terminus or the COOH terminus resulted in an increased mechanosensitivity of the channels. This effect was characterized by both a reduction in p 1/2 and an increase in the slope of the curve in the Boltzmann distribution. These results modify somewhat the conclusion of previous studies, performed on mutated channels, that most of the COOH-terminal extension plays no role in mechanosensitivity (23.Blount P. Sukharev S.I. Shroeder M.J. Nagle S.K. Kung C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 11652-11657Crossref PubMed Scopus (181) Google Scholar, 24.Häse C.C. Le Dain A.C. Martinac B. J. Membr. Biol. 1997; 157: 17-25Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). The interest of the approach that has been used here is that it allows monitoring of the activity of channels in the same patch before and after application of proteases. The approach that uses mutated channels necessarily implies comparison of channel activities recorded in different patches, which may be more problematic. A limitation of the protease approach, however, is that the precise cleavage sites are unknown. Chymotrypsin cleavage sites are likely to be Phe-7 and Phe-10 (Fig. 1), indicating that deletion of part of the NH2 terminus (the first 7 or 10 amino acids of the protein) increased the sensitivity to pressure of MscL channels. Aminopeptidase and carboxypeptidase hydrolyze one amino acid after another, starting from the NH2 terminus and the COOH terminus, respectively, and stopping at an unknown distance of the membrane determined by steric hindrance. It is therefore not possible to know to what extent the NH2 and the COOH termini have been deleted in these experiments. Independently of its importance for the understanding of the channel mechanosensitivity, the finding that a limited proteolysis of the NH2 or COOH terminus of MscL increases its sensitivity to membrane tension might have a physiological relevance. In particular, it is remarkable that the numerous homologs of MscL which have now been found all have substantial cytoplasmic COOH-terminal extension. Several residues in this extension are conserved (25.Moe P.C. Blount P. Kung C. Mol. Microbiol. 1998; 28: 583-592Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar). This fact is difficult to understand, if, as suggested previously, this part of the protein plays no part in the channel function. A suggestion raised by our results is that the COOH-terminal extension plays a modulatory role, perhaps through interactions with other molecules. The most striking result of this study is that the channel remains mechanosensitive after the external loop has been cleaved. As discussed above, the external loop, the only non-membranous part of the channel on the periplasmic side, is accessible from the pipette in the reconstituted system. Therefore the change in channel kinetics and mechanosensitivity observed when trypsin or chymotrypsin is present in the pipette indicates that the loop was cleaved at one or two of the trypsin- or chymotrypsin-sensitive sites present in this region of the molecule (Fig. 1). Indeed, it is extremely unlikely that cleavage might have occurred at sites present in the transmembrane segments because this is never observed for membrane proteins. Given the symmetry of the homo-oligomer, one may expect that after a steady state has been reached, all of the subunits of the channels have been cleaved. Importantly, the effect of trypsin or chymotrypsin was only observed when the channel was gating, indicating that its opening results in a conformational change of the loop which exposes its protease-sensitive sites. Reconstitution of functional membrane proteins from proteolytic fragments or from genetically cleaved fragments has been reported for membrane protein (for review, see Ref. 26.Popot J.-L. De Vitry C. Atteia A. White S.H. Membrane Protein Structure. Oxford University Press, New York1994: 41-96Crossref Google Scholar). However, to our knowledge, this is the first time that the activity of a membrane protein has been monitored at the level of a single molecule after cleavage of all the of loops of the protein. That, after this treatment, the channel retained its main characteristic, mechanosensitivity, and that its conductance had not been altered, attest to the importance of the interactions between the transmembrane helices for both the stability and activity of the molecule. We are left with the remarkable conclusion that two unconnected segments plus a few amino acids on each side of the membrane are sufficient for the activity of a mechanosensitive channel. The integrity of the loop seemed not to be essential for mechanosensitivity itself. Therefore the external loop appears to act as a spring that resists opening of the channel and promotes its closure when it is open. Its stiffness sets the level of sensitivity of the channel to membrane tension. Taken as a whole, the results presented here strongly suggest that all of the different extramembranous parts of the channel counteract the movement of the transmembrane helices triggered by a change in membrane tension. The COOH termini interacting with each other by forming a bundle (19.Chang G. Spencer R.H. Lee A.T. Barclay M.T. Rees D.C. Science. 1998; 282: 2220-2226Crossref PubMed Scopus (858) Google Scholar) would resist the movement of the M2 helices. The cytoplasmic NH2 termini may also interact with each other and resist the movement of the M1 helices. The geometry of the external loop counteracts the movement of the two helices relative to each other. This leads us to propose that both M1 and M2 helices move when the channel opens. This could be possible if membrane tension itself, or thinning of the membrane upon stretch, modifies the orientation of each helix in the membrane and/or specifically modifies the interaction in the membrane between the two helices of an MscL subunit. The movement of these helices would be at the basis of mechanosensation for this molecule. It is not known how membrane tension or membrane thinning can affect transmembrane helices in membrane proteins, and it is therefore unclear what makes MscL helices specifically sensitive to membrane tension. The importance of the transmembrane helices for mechanosensation which is proposed here is consistent with a previous report indicating that several residues in both helices are highly conserved in MscL homologs (25.Moe P.C. Blount P. Kung C. Mol. Microbiol. 1998; 28: 583-592Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar). Moreover, a recent study has highlighted the importance of helix M1 for mechanosensitivity. Randomly mutagenized mscL genes were expressed in bacteria that were screened for gain-of-function mutants with impaired growth. The most severe mutations, which resulted in channels gating at anomalous low tension, were found on one facet of transmembrane helix M1 (27.Ou X. Blount P. Hoffman R.J. Kung C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 11471-11475Crossref PubMed Scopus (168) Google Scholar). In the closed conformation, as revealed by x-ray diffraction, the pore formed by M1 helices, is a funnel whose radius varies from 18 Å on the periplasmic side to 2 Å on the cytoplasmic side, where it is occluded (19.Chang G. Spencer R.H. Lee A.T. Barclay M.T. Rees D.C. Science. 1998; 282: 2220-2226Crossref PubMed Scopus (858) Google Scholar). Therefore, opening the channel requires a tilting of the M1 helices that are presumed to be pulled away from each other upon application of tension to the membrane. MscL, which has a high conductance and is able to catalyze the release of molecules such as thioredoxin (12.Ajouz B. Berrier C. Garrigues A. Besnard M. Ghazi A. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 26670-26674Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar), has a very large pore whose diameter was estimated to be around 40 Å by electrophysiological experiments (28.Cruickshank C.C. Minchin R.F. Le Dain A.C. Martinac B. Biophys. J. 1997; 73: 1925-1931Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (208) Google Scholar). Given the mean distance between α-helices in membrane proteins, it is doubtful that only M1 helices are sufficient to make such a large pore, and it is therefore probable that M2 helices also participate in the formation of the open pore (28.Cruickshank C.C. Minchin R.F. Le Dain A.C. Martinac B. Biophys. J. 1997; 73: 1925-1931Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (208) Google Scholar). These considerations lead to the putative model of Fig. 7 which enables us to interpret the whole of the data presented here. An increase in membrane tension modifies the interactions between M1 and M2 helices or between these helices and the core of the membrane causing both helices to tilt, with the M2 helices intercalating between the M1 helices. These movements are opposed by the non-membranous domains, thus setting the level of mechanosensitivity of the channel. On each α-helix, the amino acids immediately adjacent to the membrane on the cytoplasmic side certainly play an important role because their deletion results in an inactive channel (23.Blount P. Sukharev S.I. Shroeder M.J. Nagle S.K. Kung C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 11652-11657Crossref PubMed Scopus (181) Google Scholar, 24.Häse C.C. Le Dain A.C. Martinac B. J. Membr. Biol. 1997; 157: 17-25Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). This could not be seen in our experiments, probably because these residues are too close to the membrane to be accessible to proteases, but it is of interest to note that trypsin or chymotrypsin, perfused in the bath, totally abolished the activity of another mechanosensitive channel, MscS, in patch-clamp experiments performed on the native membrane (29.Ajouz B. Besnard M. Berrier C. Martinac B. Ghazi A. Biophys. J. 1998; 74 (abstr.): 238Google Scholar). It is possible that these cytoplasmic residues are important to keep the helices in an appropriate orientation relative to the plane of the membrane. Are the results described here relevant for the understanding of the molecular mechanisms of mechanosensitive channels outside the bacterial domain? Although bacterial mechanosensitive channels have been shown to gate in response to bilayer tension alone, it is usually considered that the tethered model is more likely to describe the functioning of eukaryotic mechanosensitive channels. In this model, a direct connection is hypothesized between the gate of the channel and proteins located in the extracellular matrix and/or the cytoskeleton (30.Hamill O.P. McBride D.W. Annu. Rev. Physiol. 1997; 59: 621-631Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar). A displacement of the channel relative to the extracellular matrix or the cytoskeleton will cause the channel to open or close. In the case of mechanotransduction in Caenorhabditis elegans, for instance, several non-membranous proteins are believed to interact with the mechanosensitive channel (31.Tavernarakis N. Driscoll M. Annu. Rev. Physiol. 1997; 59: 659-689Crossref PubMed Scopus (183) Google Scholar, 32.Garcia-Añoveros J. Corey D.P. Annu. Rev. Neurosci. 1997; 20: 567-594Crossref PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar). The MEC-4 and MEC-10 proteins, which belong to the DEG/ENaC superfamily, are likely to encode subunits of this mechanosensitive channel. These proteins have a similar predicted topology that includes two transmembrane domains, an extracellular loop, and internal COOH and NH2 termini (31.Tavernarakis N. Driscoll M. Annu. Rev. Physiol. 1997; 59: 659-689Crossref PubMed Scopus (183) Google Scholar, 32.Garcia-Añoveros J. Corey D.P. Annu. Rev. Neurosci. 1997; 20: 567-594Crossref PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar). It is clear, however, that modifications of the cytoskeleton might alter the mechanical properties of the membrane. Furthermore, the results presented here indicate that interactions with the end terminals and/or the loop of such proteins might greatly alter their mechanosensitivity, even if the channels are gated by membrane tension alone. Although no sequence similarity exists between MscL and the members of the DEG/ENaC superfamily, the overall structural similarity is striking. It is therefore possible that some of these channels share a common mechanism, for which the scheme outlined above could provide a working model."

As a model system, we chose two channels in T-lymphocytes, the voltage-gated channel Kv1.3and the Ca2+-activated channel IKCa1. Homology models of both channels were generated based on the crystal structure of the bacterial channel KcsA. Initial docking of charybdotoxin was undertaken with both models, and the accuracy of these docking configurations was tested by mutant cycle analyses, establishing that charybdotoxin has a similar docking configuration in the external vestibules of IKCa1 and Kv1.3. Comparison of the refined models revealed a unique cluster of negatively charged residues in the turret of Kv1.3, not present in IKCa1. To exploit this difference, three novel charybdotoxin analogs were designed by introducing negatively charged residues in place of charybdotoxin Lys32, which lies in close proximity to this cluster. These analogs block IKCa1with ∼20-fold higher affinity than Kv1.3. The other charybdotoxin-sensitive Kv channels, Kv1.2 andKv1.6, contain the negative cluster and are predictably insensitive to the charybdotoxin position 32 analogs, whereas the maxi-KCa channel, hSlo, lacking the cluster, is sensitive to the analogs. This provides strong evidence for topological similarity of the external vestibules of diverse K+channels and demonstrates the feasibility of using structure-based strategies to design selective inhibitors for mammalian K+channels. The availability of potent and selective inhibitors ofIKCa1 will help to elucidate the role of this channel in T-lymphocytes during the immune response as well as in erythrocytes and colonic epithelia.

Venoms from spiders, scorpions, snakes, bees, and marine extracts have yielded polypeptide inhibitors of mammalian K+ channels, many of which bind with high affinity to a vestibule at the external entrance of the channel pore. Some of these polypeptide toxins have been used as molecular calipers to estimate the dimensions of K+ channel vestibules (1.Stocker M. Miller C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Recently, the structure of the bacterial K+ channel KcsA fromStreptomyces lividans has been determined by x-ray crystallography (8.Doyle D.A. Morais Cabral J. Pfuetzner R.A. Kuo A. Gulbis J.M. Cohen S.L. Chait B.T. MacKinnon R. Science. 1998; 280: 69-77Crossref PubMed Scopus (5769) Google Scholar). The turret region and the external pore of this channel correspond to the external toxin-binding vestibule in eukaryotic K+ channels, and the crystallographic dimensions of the KcsA channel vestibule are remarkably similar to those estimated by toxin-mapping methods for eukaryotic K+channels (9.MacKinnon R. Cohen S.L. Kuo A. Lee A. Chait B.T. Science. 1998; 280: 106-109Crossref PubMed Scopus (371) Google Scholar). The convergence of these two approaches raises the possibility of exploiting structure-based strategies to design specific inhibitors that target pharmacologically relevant K+channel targets. To test the feasibility of this approach, we have used charybdotoxin (ChTX),1 a polypeptide that potently blocks the voltage-gated channel Kv1.3 and the Ca2+-activated channel IKCa1, both present in human T-lymphocytes (10.Logsdon N.J.

These two channels have been chosen as our model system since they are widely regarded as therapeutic targets. Both channels regulate the membrane potential of resting and activated T-cells and modulate the calcium signaling response that is essential for their activation (12.Cahalan M.D. Chandy K.G. Curr. Opin. Biotechnol. 1997; 8: 749-756Crossref PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar). Inhibitors of these channels block the activation of human T-lymphocytes (13.Koo G.C. Blake J.T. Talento A. Nguyen M.

Several potent and selective peptide and non-peptide inhibitors are available forKv1.3. However, there is a dearth of selective blockers of the Ca2+-activated IKCa1 channel, and the most selective inhibitor of this channel, clotrimazole, also inhibits cytochrome P450-dependent enzymes (16.Brugnara C.

Highly specific blockers of the IKCa1 channel may therefore have clinical use in both these ailments as well as a potential use as immunosuppressants. In this study, we have constructed homology models of IKCa1and Kv1.3 based on the crystal structure of theKcsA channel and performed preliminary docking of ChTX for heuristic purposes. The accuracy of these docking configurations was tested by mutant cycle analysis that measures the strength of coupling between interactive pairs of toxin and channel residues (26.Schreiber G. Fersht A.R. J. Mol. Biol. 1995; 248: 478-486Crossref PubMed Scopus (523) Google Scholar). Using this approach, we have determined the ChTX docking configuration in both channels and identified a structural feature unique to the ChTX-IKCa1 interaction surface. This paper describes the guided design and electrophysiological characterization of three novel ChTX analogs that specifically target this unique IKCa1motif. Cell lines stably expressing mouseKv1.1, rat Kv1.2, mouse Kv1.3, humanKv1.4, human Kv1.5, and mouse Kv3.1(27.Grissmer S. Nguyen A.N. Aiyar J. Hanson D.C. Mather R.J. Gutman G.A. Karmilowicz M.J.

Fmoc-derivatives were obtained from Bachem AG (Bubendorf, Switzerland). Solid-phase assembly was initiated with t-butyl-Fmoc-Ser resin. Automated stepwise assembly was carried out entirely on an ABI 431A peptide synthesizer (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA). The ChTX position 32 analogs were solubilized, oxidized, and purified by reversed-phase HPLC, and fractions were pooled and lyophilized. The structure and purity of the peptides were confirmed by reversed-phase HPLC, amino acid analysis, and electrospray ionization mass spectrometry analysis. Samples were weighed and adjusted to account for peptide content prior to bioassay. The ChTX-Asp25 analog has been described (4.Aiyar J. Withka J.M. Rizzi J.P. Singleton D.H. Andrews G.C. Lin W.

Fig. 1 shows the amino acid sequence of the turret region, pore, and parts of the inner helix of the KcsA channel aligned with the corresponding regions of IKCa1 and Kv1.3. These channel regions interact with polypeptide toxin inhibitors, and mapping studies with these toxins have shown that the external vestibules of theKv1.3 and IKCa1 channels are topologically similar to that of KcsA (7.Rauer H.

Based on this alignment (>50% sequence identity) and published structural data for theKcsA channel (8.Doyle D.A. Morais Cabral J. Pfuetzner R.A. Kuo A. Gulbis J.M. Cohen S.L. Chait B.T. MacKinnon R. Science. 1998; 280: 69-77Crossref PubMed Scopus (5769) Google Scholar), homology models of the IKCa1and Kv1.3 vestibules were constructed and energy-minimized. Coordinates for KcsA (Protein Data Bank code 1BL8) were kindly supplied by Dr. MacKinnon (Rockefeller University). Residues in each subunit that were not defined in the crystal structure (Arg27, Ile60, Arg64, Glu71, and Arg117) were inserted using the Biopolymer module of Insight98 (Molecular Simulations Inc., San Diego, CA). Models of Kv1.3 and IKCa1 were generated from the corrected structure by mutating appropriate KcsAresidues (between positions 23 and 119) in Biopolymer, thus simulating the S5-P-S6 regions of the two larger mammalian channels (see Fig. 1). These models were energy-minimized in the CVFF force field of the Discover module of Insight98. 10,000 iterations were performed using the conjugate gradient algorithm with a 25-Å cutoff for non-bonded atoms and a distance-dependent dielectric in place of explicit water molecules (10,000 iterations were sufficient to bring each model to steady state). K+ channels possess a conserved selectivity filter, Gly-Tyr-Gly-Asp, located in the channel pore. In KcsA, the backbone carbonyl groups of this selectivity filter are arranged in the pore lumen so as to form a series of oxygen rings, the dimensions of which allow the coordination of desolvated K+ ions. The Tyr side chains are oriented away from the pore and form hydrogen bonds with surrounding Trp side chains, suggesting the possibility that this acts like a spring to hold the pore open to the appropriate dimensions (8.Doyle D.A. Morais Cabral J. Pfuetzner R.A. Kuo A. Gulbis J.M. Cohen S.L. Chait B.T. MacKinnon R. Science. 1998; 280: 69-77Crossref PubMed Scopus (5769) Google Scholar). In KcsA, this hydrogen bonding is observed between Tyr78 and Trp68. Although a Trp67-Trp68 diad is conserved inKv1.3 and Shaker, only the equivalent of Trp67 is found in IKCa1 (Trp242). Assuming that the spring mechanism exists in IKCa1 as it does in KcsA, it is presumably mediated by Tyr253–Trp242 hydrogen bonding. In an attempt to preserve the overall architecture of each channel model while allowing any mutated residues to find their respective local energy minima, the Cα atoms of all channel residues were fixed in Cartesian space during the course of energy minimization (and during subsequent molecular dynamics simulations). Our Kv1.3 model is similar to that described previously (31.Kalman K. Pennington M.W. Lanigan M.D. Nguyen A. Rauer H. Mahnir V. Paschetto K. Kem W.R. Grissmer S. Gutman G.A. Christian E.P. Cahalan M.D. Norton R.S. Chandy K.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 32697-32707Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (230) Google Scholar), although the earlier model was constructed without access to the KcsAcoordinates. Energy-minimized channel models were juxtaposed with the closest-to-average conformation of ChTX in such a way as to preclude steric contact (typically this resulted in the closest possible contacts between ligand and receptor being ≥10 Å). ChTX was then positioned manually so that Lys27 was facing the pore and Arg25 was oriented toward channel residues, consistent with earlier studies (4.Aiyar J. Withka J.M. Rizzi J.P. Singleton D.H. Andrews G.C. Lin W. Boyd J. Hanson D.C. Simon M. Dethlefs B. Lee C. Hall J.E. Gutman G.A. Chandy K.G. Neuron. 1995; 15: 1169-1181Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (266) Google Scholar). Further mutant cycle analyses were performed to test the ChTX-IKCa1 interactions predicted by the docking model. To preserve the overall architecture of ChTX and the channel models during docking, various constraints were placed on both molecules prior to performing molecular dynamics. The Cα atoms of all channel residues were fixed in Cartesian space, and distances measured from the structure of ChTX (33d αα(i,i+4) distances along the backbone of ChTX and 3 d ααdistances, representing the disulfide bonds at positions 7–28, 13–33, and 17–35 were applied as constraints in Discover with a tolerance of ±0.1 Å and a force constant of 1000 kcal·mol−1. Docking simulations were performed by first energy-minimizing the restrained ligand-receptor complex as outlined above, followed by 250 ps of molecular dynamics at 300 K with a 1.0-fs time step, a 25-Å cutoff for non-bonded atoms, and a distance-dependent dielectric. A 25-Å cutoff distance was used even though it lengthens the computation time because initial docking simulations with cutoff distances of 15 and 20 Å did not reproduce some expected interactions between charged side chains of the toxin and channel. After allowing ∼50 ps for equilibration, the lowest van der Waals energy conformation was further energy-minimized as described above. Models of ChTX docked to Kv1.3 and IKCa1 were analyzed using Insight98. An alternative docking simulation was tried in which the turret region of the Kv1.3 model (residues 373–379 of each subunit) was left unrestrained to determine what effect this might have on potential electrostatic interactions between it and the Lys32 region of ChTX. In this simulation, the turret moved outward (further away from ChTX) relative to the simulation in which it was restrained. Each K+ channel expression construct was specifically linearized and transcribedin vitro. As described earlier, the cRNA, together with a fluorescent fluorescein isothiocyanate dye, was injected into rat basophilic leukemia cells. Fluorescent cells were visualized after 2–6 h of incubation, and specific currents were measured using the patch-clamp technique (32.Rauer H. Grissmer S. Mol. Pharmacol. 1996; 50: 1625-1634PubMed Google Scholar, 33.Rauer H. Grissmer S. Br. J. Pharmacol. 1999; 127: 1065-1074Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). Cells measured in the whole-cell configuration were bathed in mammalian Ringer's solution containing 160 mm NaCl, 4.5 mm KCl, 2 mmCaCl2, 1 mm MgCl2, and 10 mm HEPES (adjusted to pH 7.4 with NaOH) with an osmolarity of 290–320 mosm. The internal pipette solution for Kv recordings contained 134 mm potassium fluoride, 1 mm CaCl2, 2 mm MgCl2, 10 mm HEPES, and 10 mm EGTA (adjusted to pH 7.2 with KOH) with an osmolarity of 290–310 mosm, and these currents were measured following 200-ms depolarizing pulses to 40 mV from the holding potential every 30 s. The internal pipette solution for IKCa and SKCa recordings contained 135 mm potassium aspartate, 2 mmMgCl2, 10 mm HEPES, 10 mm EGTA, and 8.7 mm CaCl2 (adjusted to pH 7.2 with KOH) with an osmolarity of 290–310 mosm (free [Ca2+]i = 10−6m). Kv currents were activated by a 200-ms voltage step from a holding potential of −80 to 40 mV every 30 s. KCa currents were activated with 1 μm free Ca2+iand 200-ms voltage ramps from −150 to 50 mV applied every 5 s (holding potential = −80 mV). For hSlo expression, 25–50 ng of cRNA was injected into Xenopus laevis oocytes 3 to 6 days prior to recording. The outside-out patch-clamp configuration was used to record macroscopic hSlo currents. For these experiments, the external solution contained 140 mmNaMeSO3, 10 mm HEPES, 2 mmMgCl2, and 2 mm KCl (adjusted to pH 7.4 with NaOH), whereas the internal solution contained 140 mmKMeSO3, 10 mm HEPES, 2 mmMgCl2, 2 mm KCl, and 1 mm H-EDTA, and CaCl2 was added to obtain a free [Ca2+]i of 5 × 10−5m (adjusted to pH 7.2 with KOH). hSlo currents were activated with 50 μm free Ca2+iand 200-ms voltage ramps from −80 to 80 mV applied every 5 s. Series-resistance compensation (80%) was used if the current exceeded 2 nA. Leak currents were subtracted using the P/8 procedure for Kv currents. K d values were calculated using the equation K d = ([toxin]/((1/y) − 1)) (y = unblocked fraction of current) and are shown as mean ± S.D. (n ≥ 4). Toxin-channel interactions, predicted from the docking configuration of ChTX in IKCa1, were tested experimentally by mutant cycle analysis. This method evaluates the strength of the interaction between any given pair of channel and toxin residues. For each mutant cycle, we measured the potency (K d) of ChTX and its analogs onIKCa1 and its mutants. The change in coupling energy (ΔΔG) for a given pair of ChTX-IKCa1 residues and their mutants was calculated using the formula ΔΔG = kTlnΩ, as described (7.Rauer H. Pennington M. Cahalan M. Chandy K.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 21885-21892Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar). Based on earlier studies (3.Hidalgo P. MacKinnon R. Science. 1995; 268: 307-310Crossref PubMed Scopus (427) Google Scholar, 26.Schreiber G. Fersht A.R. J. Mol. Biol. 1995; 248: 478-486Crossref PubMed Scopus (523) Google Scholar), ΔΔG values ≥0.5 kcal·mol−1 indicate that a pair of toxin and channel residues are likely to lie within 5 Å of each other. Our approach to design a selective inhibitor relies on the identification of a unique feature in the ChTX-IKCa1interface that is absent from the ChTX-Kv1.3 binding surface. Therefore, the success of our comparative structure-based design strategy depends on understanding how ChTX interacts with theIKCa1 and Kv1.3 vestibules. To accomplish this, we developed homology models of the Kv1.3 andIKCa1 pore and vestibule regions (S5-P-S6 segments) based on the amino acid sequence alignment shown in Fig.1 and the crystal structure ofKcsA (see “Materials and Methods”). Initial docking of ChTX was performed based on published data for Kv1.3 and then carried out for IKCa1 under the assumption that ChTX may interact in a similar way. Both docking models were then tested by mutant cycle analyses, and these results were used to generate final refined docking models (Fig. 2). Comparison of the two docking models revealed a unique motif in the ChTX-Kv1.3 interface that is absent in the ChTX-IKCa1 binding surface, and three related ChTX analogs were designed to target this difference. Several well characterized ChTX-Kv1.3 interactions, previously identified by mutant cycle analyses and electrostatic compliance experiments (4.Aiyar J. Withka J.M. Rizzi J.P. Singleton D.H. Andrews G.C. Lin W. Boyd J. Hanson D.C. Simon M. Dethlefs B. Lee C. Hall J.E. Gutman G.A. Chandy K.G. Neuron. 1995; 15: 1169-1181Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (266) Google Scholar), were used to dock ChTX in the vestibule of the Kv1.3 model. In this configuration, Lys27 of ChTX protrudes into the pore in close proximity toKv1.3-Tyr400 located in the selectivity filter. ChTX-Arg25 interacts withKv1.3-Asp386 (in one subunit) andKv1.3-His404 (from two adjacent subunits). The docking model based on these data also predicts an interaction between ChTX-Lys31 and Kv1.3-Asp386 in the subunit diametrically opposite to that interacting with ChTX-Arg25. Mutant cycles were therefore performed with ChTX(Lys31 → Glu)-Kv1.3(Asp386 → Lys) and ChTX(Lys31 → Gln)-Kv1.3(Asp386 → Lys); these yielded ΔΔG values of 1.35 and 0.74 kcal·mol−1, respectively, indicating that Kv1.3-Asp386 and ChTX-Lys31 lie within 5 Å of each other (26.Schreiber G. Fersht A.R. J. Mol. Biol. 1995; 248: 478-486Crossref PubMed Scopus (523) Google Scholar). Consistent with our results, Lys31 in agitoxin has been reported to couple to the residue in the Shaker channel (Asp431) that is homologous toKv1.3-Asp386 (3.Hidalgo P. MacKinnon R. Science. 1995; 268: 307-310Crossref PubMed Scopus (427) Google Scholar, 6.Ranganathan R. Lewis J.H. MacKinnon R. Neuron. 1996; 16: 131-139Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (277) Google Scholar). The polypeptide toxin ChTX blocks Kv1.3(K d = 2 nm) and IKCa1(K d = 5 nm) with almost identical potency (10.Logsdon N.J. Kang J. Togo J.A. Christian E.P. Aiyar J. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 32723-32726Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (256) Google Scholar, 11.Fanger C.M. Ghanshani S. Logsdon N.J. Rauer H. Kalman K. Zhou J. Beckingham K. Chandy K.G.

Physiol. 1993; 102: 601-630Crossref PubMed Scopus (221) Google Scholar), and another toxin, Stichodactyla helianthus toxin, utilizes a similar core-binding domain to bind to both channels (7.Rauer H. Pennington M. Cahalan M. Chandy K.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 21885-21892Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar), albeit with very different potencies (16 pm versus 30 nm). Hence, ChTX might be expected to sit in the IKCa1 vestibule with a similar geometry to that in Kv1.3. Guided by the ChTX-Kv1.3 docking model, a docking simulation of ChTX in the IKCa1 vestibule was performed for heuristic reasons. This docking model predicts that IKCa1-Asp239, the residue homologous to Kv1.3-Asp386 (Fig. 1), lies in close proximity to ChTX-Arg25 and ChTX-Lys31, but not to ChTX-Lys32. In this model, the critical ChTX residue, Lys27, protrudes into the channel pore and lies in the vicinity of Tyr253 in the selectivity filter. These docking models were tested experimentally by evaluating the coupling energy of specific residues predicted to be in close proximity and then refined. Specifically, we determined the coupling energies for the following pairs of specific toxin/channel residues using mutant cycle analyses: ChTX-Arg25/IKCa1-Asp239, ChTX-Lys31/IKCa1-Asp239, ChTX-Lys32/IKCa1-Asp239, and ChTX-Lys27/IKCa1-pore. Replacement of the negatively charged residue Asp239 in IKCa1 with the neutral asparagine (Asn239) reduced the K d for native ChTX by ∼14-fold. A more substantial reduction in affinity of ∼180-fold was observed when a positively charged lysine (IKCa1-Lys239) was introduced at this channel position (Fig. 3, A andB). Neither mutation altered the biophysical properties of the channel. Charge reversal mutations at ChTX positions 25 (Arg25 → Asp) and 31 (Lys31 → Glu) also dramatically decreased toxin affinity by ∼1325- and ∼47-fold, respectively, for the wild-type IKCa1 channel (Fig. 3,A–C). In contrast, a similar mutation at ChTX position 32 (Lys32 → Asp) decreased affinity by only 9-fold (Fig.3 D). Thermodynamic double-mutant cycle analyses were performed to measure the change in coupling energy betweenIKCa1-Asp239 and each of the three ChTX residues Arg25, Lys31, and Lys32. The ΔΔG values for the mutant cycles shown in Fig.3 B are 2.25 and 3.1 kcal·mol−1, respectively, indicating that IKCa1-Asp239 and ChTX-Arg25 lie within 5 Å of each other. Strong coupling was also seen between IKCa1-Asp239 and ChTX-Lys31, with the coupling energies being 1.9 and 2.4 kcal·mol−1 for the two cycles shown in Fig.3 C. In contrast, the ΔΔG of 0.02 kcal·mol−1 for the cycle in Fig. 3 D indicates that IKCa1-Asp239 and ChTX-Lys32 are not energetically coupled. Two approaches were used to test the proximity of ChTX-Lys27 to the IKCa1 pore, the first showing that it lies close to a K+-binding site and the second demonstrating that a shorter analog at this position (ChTX-Orn27) interacts with a residue at the outer mouth of the pore. All K+ channel toxin inhibitors contain a critical lysine residue (in this case, ChTX-Lys27) that projects into the channel pore (34.Dauplais M. Lecoq A. Song J. Cotton J. Jamin N. Gilquin B.

Occupancy of this site by K+ ions destabilizes toxin interactions withKv1.3 via electrostatic repulsion of this critical lysine (5.Aiyar J. Rizzi J.P. Gutman G.A. Chandy K.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 31013-31016Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar, 6.Ranganathan R. Lewis J.H. MacKinnon R.

Chem. 1999; 274: 21885-21892Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar). If ChTX-Lys27 lies close to a K+-binding site near Tyr253 in the selectivity filter of the IKCa1 pore, then occupancy of this site by K+ ions should reduce the affinity of the toxin for the channel. We tested this by examining the effect of increasing the external K+ concentration from 4.5 to 164 mm on the affinity of the IKCa1 channel for ChTX-Lys27. As a control, we also performed this experiment using the ChTX analog ChTX-Dap27, in which Lys27 was replaced by the shorter (2.5 Å) positively charged non-natural amino acid diaminopropionic acid. Earlier studies on Kv1.3 have shown that Dap27 interacts with His404 at the entrance of the pore (5.Aiyar J. Rizzi J.P. Gutman G.A. Chandy K.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 31013-31016Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar), rather than with the K+-binding site in the selectivity filter, and the same may be true for IKCa1. Therefore, the interaction of Dap27 with the IKCa1 pore should be insensitive to changes in the external K+ concentration. Consistent with our prediction, the mutant cycle shown in Fig.4 A yields a strong coupling energy (ΔΔG = 0.76 kcal·mol−1), indicating that ChTX-Lys27 lies within 5 Å of a K+-binding site located in the IKCa1 pore. Interestingly, the critical lysine at position 22 in the sea anemoneS. helianthus toxin also interacts with a K+-binding site within the pore of the IKCa1channel, and the affinity of S. helianthus toxin forIKCa1 is reduced as the external K+concentration is increased (7.Rauer H. Pennington M. Cahalan M. Chandy K.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 21885-21892Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar). We also examined the sensitivity of Kv1.3 andIKCa1 to the analog ChTX-Orn27, in which the shorter positively charged ornithine (side chain length of 5.0 Å) was substituted for the critical Lys27 residue (chain length of 6.3 Å). As shown in Fig. 4 B, this analog blockedKv1.3 in the nanomolar range (K d = 196 nm), but was significantly less effective againstIKCa1 (K d = 3300 nm). Since ChTX-Lys27 protrudes into the pores of bothIKCa1 and Kv1.3, why does ChTX-Orn27have lower affinity for IKCa1 than for Kv1.3? The outer pore regions of both channels are almost identical (Fig. 1), except for the presence of a histidine (His404) at the entrance to the Kv1.3 pore in place of valine (Val257) in IKCa1. To determine whether this difference might contribute to the differential sensitivity to ChTX-Orn27, we replaced Kv1.3-His404with valine and measured the affinity of ChTX-Orn27 for this mutant channel, which more closely resembles the IKCa1pore. In keeping with our hypothesis, ChTX-Orn27 blockedKv1.3-Val404 with an affinity similar to that for IKCa1 and significantly less than that for wild-typeKv1.3 (Fig. 4 B). We were unable to determine the effect of the reverse mutation (Val257 → His) on the sensitivity of IKCa1 to ChTX-Orn27 since this mutant channel is nonfunctional. Our mutant cycle studies demonstrate that ChTX-Arg25and ChTX-Lys31 interact withIKCa1-Asp239 in different subunits, whereas ChTX-Lys27 lies close to a K+-binding site in the pore. The docking configuration of ChTX with both models was recalculated using these experimental data as restraints in molecular dynamics simulations (Fig. 2). Where significant coupling was observed between toxin and channel residues (ΔΔG > 0.7 kcal·mol−1), a target distance (as noted below) was applied between specific atoms from each residue with a 50 kcal·mol−1 force constant (31.Kalman K. Pennington M.W. Lanigan M.D. Nguyen A. Rauer H. Mahnir V. Paschetto K. Kem W.R. Grissmer S. Gutman G.A. Christian E.P. Cahalan M.D. Norton R.S. Chandy K.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 32697-32707Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (230) Google Scholar). Thus, docking constraints were applied between the following pairs of atoms: ChTX-Kv1.3 docking, Lys27 Nζ–Tyr400 Cβ (from all four subunits), Arg25 Cζ–His404Nδ1 (from two adjacent subunits, target distance of 8.0 Å), and Lys31 Nζ–Asp386Cγ (from a single subunit, target distance of 6.0 Å); and ChTX-IKCa1 docking, Lys27Nζ–Tyr253 Cβ (from all four subunits), Arg25 Cζ–Asp239Cγ (from a single subunit), and Lys31Nζ–Asp386 Cγ (from a single subunit, target distance of 6.0 Å). The final docking configurations of ChTX with Kv1.3 andIKCa1 (Fig. 2) place the toxin in similar orientations in the two channels, highlighting the usefulness of homology modeling approaches in defining toxin-channel interactions. In the case ofKv1.3, the orientation of the toxin about the pore axis is guided by the proximity of Arg25 to His404. Coupling of Arg25 to two His404 side chains in adjacent subunits brings the former in closer proximity to Asp386, an interaction alluded to by Aiyar et al. (5.Aiyar J. Rizzi J.P. Gutman G.A. Chandy K.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 31013-31016Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar), than if Arg25 is coupled to only one His404 side chain. This docking configuration of ChTX withKv1.3 matches closely the ChTX docking configuration withIKCa1 (Fig. 2). Thus, ChTX utilizes the same three key residues, Arg25, Lys27, and Lys31, to interact with homologous residues in the external vestibules ofKv1.3 and IKCa1. ChTX-Arg25 and ChTX-Lys31, positioned at opposite ends of the toxin, interact with Kv1.3-Asp386 andIKCa1-Asp239 in diametrically opposite subunits of these channel tetramers. ChTX-Lys27, located at the center of the channel-binding surface in the toxin, projects into the pores and lies close to the selectivity filter of both channels. A similar toxin-channel interaction has also been shown for S. helianthus toxin, which utilizes a conserved core domain to interact with Kv1.3 and IKCa1 (7.Rauer H. Pennington M. Cahalan M. Chandy K.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 21885-21892Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar) despite having a structural fold that bears no resemblance to ChTX (35.Tudor J.E. Pallaghy P.K. Pennington M.W. Norton R.S. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1996; 3: 317-320Crossref PubMed Scopus (161) Google Scholar). The amino acid sequences and refined models of IKCa1and Kv1.3 were compared to identify structural features unique to IKCa1. The sequence alignment in Fig. 1 shows a cluster of three negatively charged residues, Glu373, Asp375, and Asp376, in the turret region ofKv1.3 (shaded) that are not present inIKCa1. The Kv1.3 model (Fig. 2, A andB) shows the locations of these three acidic residues within the vestibule of Kv1.3. Glu373 and Asp376 are oriented toward the center of the channel pore, whereas Asp375 is at the outer edge of the turret. The docking configuration of ChTX in Kv1.3 indicates that ChTX-Lys32 lies in the vicinity of Glu373 and Asp376, although the terminal ammonium group of this Lys32 is ∼10 Å away. No intermolecular constraints were applied among any of these residues during the docking, but if a weak constraint was included between Asp376 Cγ and Lys32 N, the distance from Lys32 to this part of the turret decreased to ∼8 Å, without any significant change elsewhere. Based on this observation, the introduction of a negatively charged residue at ChTX position 32 might therefore significantly reduce the affinity of such an analog for Kv1.3 via electrostatic repulsion. IKCa1 contains two neutral residues (Ala226 and Gln229) and one basic residue (Arg228) (Figs. 1and 2, C and D) in place of the acidic residues in the turret of Kv1.3. The only negatively charged residue in the turret region of IKCa1 (Glu227) is located at the outer edge of the turret, pointing away from the center of the vestibule (Fig. 2,C and D), and is therefore unlikely to interact directly with any ChTX residues. In contrast to Kv1.3, a ChTX analog containing a negatively charged residue at position 32 would be expected to retain most of its potency against the IKCa1 channel."

Mutation of both of these amino acids to the corresponding amino acids in 15-LOX-2 (Asp and Val, respectively) converted the positional specificity from 8S to 90% 15S without yielding any other by-products.

These enzymes catalyze the hydroperoxidation of polyunsaturated fatty acids, usually with high positional specificity and stereospecificity. The lipoxygenase reaction is initiated by removal of a hydrogen from a methylene group between two cis double bonds, and then molecular oxygen reacts on the opposite face of the substrate to form a hydroperoxide product with a trans-cis-conjugated diene (1.Brash A.R.

Most of the work on the positional determinants of lipoxygenases has been reported for specificity between C-12 and C-15 utilizing the reticulocyte type of 15S-lipoxygenase (referred to herein as 15-LOX-1) and the different mammalian 12S-lipoxygenases. In an early report, two amino acids involved in the C-12 and C-15 specificity were identified by analysis of conserved differences in the enzyme primary structures (6.Sloane D.L. Leung R. Craik C.S. Sigal E. Nature. 1991; 354: 149-152Crossref PubMed Scopus (180) Google Scholar). It was proposed that the bulkiness of these residues determined the depth of the substrate binding pocket and hence whether hydrogen abstraction would occur at C-10 (for 12-lipoxygenase activity) or at C-13 (for 15-lipoxygenase). Subsequently, two additional candidates have been identified, F353 in rabbit 15-LOX-1 and R402 in human 15-LOX-1 (7.Borngräber S. Kuban R.-J. Anton M. Kühn H. J. Mol. Biol. 1996; 264: 1145-1153Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar, 8.Gan Q.-F. Browner M.F. Sloane D.L. Sigal E. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 25412-25418Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). All of these determinants are viewed to work via a “frameshift” that targets the hydrogen abstraction either to C-10 or C-13 on the same face of the substrate molecule (cf. Ref. 9.Kühn H. Sprecher H. Brash A.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 16300-16305Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). These determinants are not necessarily applicable to other lipoxygenases because in many cases the hydrogen abstraction occurs on a different carbon (e.g. at C-7 for 5-LOX) and/or on the opposite face of the substrate compared with the 12S- and 15S-lipoxygenases (Fig. 1) (10.Prigge S.T. Boyington J.C. Gaffney B.J. Amzel L.M. Proteins Struct. Funct. Genet. 1996; 24: 275-291Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). In 1997 and 1998 (11.Brash A.R. Boeglin W.E. Chang M.S. Proc. Natl.

These enzymes share 78% identity in their primary structures. Their nearest neighbors among other lipoxygenases show about 50% identity (13.Krieg P. Kinzig A. Heidt M. Marks F. Fürstenberger G.

Genomics. 1999; 58: 158-164Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). Human 15-LOX-1 and 15-LOX-2 are quite distinct, both in amino acid identity (∼35%) and substrate specificity and also in sites of tissue expression (11.Brash A.R. Boeglin W.E. Chang M.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 6148-6152Crossref PubMed Scopus (348) Google Scholar). Despite the structural resemblance between the mouse 8-LOX and human 15-LOX-2, their products are quite different. The 8-LOX produces solely 8S-HPETE from arachidonic acid (12.Jisaka M. Kim R.B. Nanney L.B. Boeglin W.E. Brash A.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 24410-24416Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar), whereas 15S-HPETE is the sole product from 15-LOX-2 (11.Brash A.R. Boeglin W.E. Chang M.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 6148-6152Crossref PubMed Scopus (348) Google Scholar). The hydrogen abstractions associated with these two reactions occur on different carbons (C-10 and C-13, respectively) and on different faces of the substrate. Thus, the mouse 8-LOX and human 15-LOX-2 represent new issues related to the reaction specificity of lipoxygenases. We addressed the basis of their positional specificities using chimeric enzymes and site-directed mutagenesis. Complementary DNAs of mouse 8S-lipoxygenase (8-LOX) and human 15S-lipoxygenase-2 (15-LOX-2) were obtained by PCR from cDNAs prepared from the mRNAs of phorbol ester-treated mouse skin and human hair root, respectively. 8-LOX was cloned into pCR3.1 mammalian expression vector (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA) (12.Jisaka M. Kim R.B. Nanney L.B. Boeglin W.E. Brash A.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 24410-24416Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar), and 15-LOX-2 was originally cloned into pcDNA3 mammalian expression vector (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA) (11.Brash A.R. Boeglin W.E. Chang M.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 6148-6152Crossref PubMed Scopus (348) Google Scholar) and then transferred to pCR3.1. Both pCR3.1 and pcDNA3 contain a T7 promoter for effective expression. [1-14C]Arachidonic acid was purchased from NEN Life Science Products. 8-LOX and 15-LOX-2 cDNAs contain XcmI andEcoRV sites at the corresponding positions, which separate their ORFs into three parts of almost same size: C-terminal, middle, and N-terminal regions. C-terminal chimeras, I and II (Fig.2 A), were prepared by mixed ligation between the C-terminal region cut out by double digestion ofHindIII and XcmI and the rest of the plasmids. N-terminal chimeras, III and IV (Fig. 2 A), were prepared in the same way using only EcoRV except that the rest of the plasmids were dephosphorylated before ligation. Various restriction site-independent chimeras between 8-LOX and 15 LOX-2 were prepared based on the method by Moore and Blakely (17.Moore K.R. Blakely R.D. BioTechniques. 1994; 17: 130-136PubMed Google Scholar). A tandemly connected 8-LOX and 15-LOX-2 cDNA in pCR3.1 was constructed in two steps in order to get some proper restriction sites between the two ORFs (Fig. 3 A). First, 15-LOX-2 cDNA cut out from pCR3.1 using NheI andXbaI was cloned into pSE280 (Invitrogen) pre-cut withXbaI. A clone containing the 15-LOX-2 cDNA in an inverse direction compared with the T7 promoter of the pSE280 was selected and digested with NotI to obtain a 15-LOX-2 cDNA fragment containing an HpaI site in the 5′ side of 15-LOX-2. This fragment was then transferred into a pCR3.1/8-LOX linearized by cutting with NotI. A clone containing tandemly connected 8-LOX and 15-LOX-2 cDNAs was selected, linearized by cutting the linker region between 8-LOX and 15-LOX-2 cDNAs with HpaI andKpnI, and purified from agarose gel using QIAEX II resin (Qiagen, Chatsworth, CA). Using 100 μg of the purified linear plasmid, TOP10F′-competent cells (Invitrogen) were transformed by heat shock at 42 °C. After selection of the correct size clones by gel electrophoresis, the switching point in each chimera cDNA was narrowed down by examining the restriction cut profiles and finally determined by sequencing. This first trial of chimera preparation ultimately yielded 3 useful chimeras, V, VI, and XII (Fig.4).Figure 4Structure of the in siturandom chimeras. The C-terminal regions of 8-LOX and 15-LOX-2 containing EcoRV and SmaI sites are shown. Amino acid differences are marked with asterisks. Theblack dots indicate the switching point of each chimera.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) In order to obtain much more variety of chimeras switched in the C-terminal region, a new tandem clone containing a full-length of 8-LOX cDNA and C-terminal 426 bases of 15-LOX-2 was constructed (Fig.3 B). The C-terminal portion of the parent 15-LOX-2 cDNA in pCR3.1 was cut out with SmaI and EcoRV and was cloned into pBS(SK−) (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA). The target portion was cut out again with ApaI/XbaI and transferred into pSE280 (Invitrogen), and then cut out again with ApaI and NotI and cloned into the downstream of the 8-LOX ORF in pCR3.1. The resulting chimera cDNA composed of a full-length of 8-LOX ORF and C-terminal 426 bases of 15-LOX-2 was linearized by cutting with NotI and XbaI and used to transform TOP10F′-competent cells. This chimerization resulted in 5 useful chimeras, VII, VIII, IX, X, and XI (Fig. 4). Site-directed mutagenesis in the Ser600-His604 region in 8-LOX and Tyr602-Asp603 in 15-LOX-2 was performed by PCR-based overlap extension mutagenesis using mutated synthetic oligonucleotides. The mismatching primers used are shown in Table I. Four kinds of mutants of successive two amino acids and then three kinds of mutants of one amino acid were prepared from 8-LOX, and three kinds of mutants were prepared from 15-LOX-2. The specific upstream primers for the primary PCR of 8-LOX and 15-LOX-2 anneal to SFVSEIV region (5′ GAGCTTTGTCTCTGAAATAGTCAG 3′) and GFSELIQR region (5′ GGCTTCTCTGAGTTGATACAGAGG 3′), respectively. The pCR3.1 reverse primer was used as the specific downstream primer for both enzymes. The resulting mutated fragments were digested with EcoRV and then exchanged with the corresponding region of the wild type cDNA.Table IPrimers used for the site-directed mutagenesisNameSequenceWild typeCCAGCAGTTAATTCGTCAAGTTATCACATCATTGCTCTCSS/ATCCAGCAGTTAATGCGACAAGTTATCACATCSS/TCGCAGTTAATTCGACATGTTATCACATCATTSY/CDGTTAATTCGTCATGTGATCACATCATTGCTYH/DVAATTCGTCAAGTGATGTCATCATTGCTCTCS602CGTTAATTCGTCATGTTATCACATCATTY603DAATTCGTCAAGTGATCACATCATTGCTH604VTCGTCAAGTTATGTCATCATTGCTCTCThe sequences of the primers used for the site-directed mutagenesis are shown with the original wild type sequence.

The mutated codons are underlined. All the cDNAs were expressed in HeLa cells using VTF-7, a recombinant vaccinia virus containing the T7 RNA polymerase gene (18.Blakely R.D. Clark J.A. Rudnick G. Amara S.G. Anal. Biochem. 1991; 194: 302-308Crossref PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar). Cells plated at 1 × 106 cells/35-mm well 48 h earlier were transfected with 1 μg of plasmid DNA and 3 μg of Lipofectin and harvested after 12 h. The harvested cells were sonicated on ice, and the resulting homogenate was used for LOX activity assay and Western analysis. The cell homogenates were incubated with 100 μm[1-14C]arachidonic acid for 45 min at room temperature. The products were extracted by the method of Bligh and Dyer (19.Bligh E.G. Dyer W.J. Can. J. Biochem. Physiol. 1959; 37: 911-917Crossref PubMed Scopus (41848) Google Scholar), and the extracts were analyzed directly by RP-HPLC first and then by normal phase HPLC after reduction using triphenylphosphine. For stereochemical analysis, the reduced hydroperoxide products were purified by normal phase HPLC, methylated with diazomethane, re-purified by normal phase HPLC, and then applied to chiral HPLC as described previously (11.Brash A.R. Boeglin W.E. Chang M.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 6148-6152Crossref PubMed Scopus (348) Google Scholar,12.Jisaka M. Kim R.B. Nanney L.B. Boeglin W.E. Brash A.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 24410-24416Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar). The expression level of each enzyme was estimated by Western analysis. The cell homogenate containing 20 μg of protein was separated by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and then transferred to a nylon membrane (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). The enzymes were stained as described previously (12.Jisaka M. Kim R.B. Nanney L.B. Boeglin W.E. Brash A.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 24410-24416Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar) using an antisera raised against 15-LOX-2, which cross-reacts with 8-LOX but not with 15-LOX-1, and an ECL detection kit (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech), according to the manufacturers specifications. The mouse 8-LOX cDNA and the human 15-LOX-2 cDNA contain XcmI and EcoRV sites at equivalent positions (at 730 and 1380 base pairs, respectively, in the murine sequence). These restriction sites separate the cDNAs into three almost equally sized parts: N-terminal, middle, and C-terminal regions. Four chimeric cDNAs were prepared using these restriction sites (Fig. 2 A). Chimeras I and II have the N-terminal regions exchanged at the XcmI site, whereas chimeras III and IV have the C-terminal regions exchanged at the EcoRV site. Following transfection into HeLa cells, all chimeras were expressed at the same level as the original wild type 8-LOX and 15-LOX-2 (Fig.2 B). Thus, substitution of their N- or C-terminal regions does not affect the enzyme expression probably due to the high sequential homology between the original enzymes. When expressed in HeLa cells, the wild type 8-LOX and 15-LOX-2 converted arachidonic acid exclusively to 8S-HETE and 15S-HETE, respectively, as reported previously (Fig. 2,C and D) (11.Brash A.R. Boeglin W.E. Chang M.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 6148-6152Crossref PubMed Scopus (348) Google Scholar, 12.Jisaka M. Kim R.B. Nanney L.B. Boeglin W.E. Brash A.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 24410-24416Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar). Chimeras I and III, containing the C-terminal region of 15-LOX-2, exhibited a lower level of enzymatic activity and produced solely 15-HETE (Fig. 2 E for chimera III and data not shown for chimera I). Two other chimeras, II and IV, containing the C-terminal region of 8-LOX were enzymatically inactive (data not shown). The 15-HETE product of chimera III was shown by chiral column analysis to have the 15S configuration (Fig.2 F). These data indicate that the C-terminal region of the mouse 8-LOX contains structural elements that determine its 8S specificity. In order to narrow down the positional determinants in the C-terminal region of the 8-LOX, a variety of chimeras were produced by in situchimeragenesis in Escherichia coli (17.Moore K.R. Blakely R.D. BioTechniques. 1994; 17: 130-136PubMed Google Scholar). In the first trial the bacteria were transformed with a plasmid containing the full-length 8-LOX and 15-LOX-2 cDNAs. We identified constructs that contained part of the C-terminal region of 15-LOX-2 cDNA exchanged with the corresponding region in the wild type 8-LOX sequence. Three useful chimeras were obtained (Fig. 3 A): chimera V, switched at Trp482; chimera VI at His554; and chimera XII at Leu610 (Fig. 4). After expression in HeLa cells, chimeras V and VI exhibited purely 15-LOX activity, similar to chimera III, and without any other detectable products including 8-HETE (data not shown). The activity of chimera XII was identical to the original 8-LOX (data not shown). This first set of chimeras preparedin situ showed that the positional determinants of the 8-LOX were located between the switching points of chimera VI (switched at His554) and XII (switched at Leu610) and that the downstream region beyond Leu610 is not involved. To obtain a greater number of chimeras switched in the region between His554 and Leu610, the second set of chimeras was prepared using the full-length 8-LOX ORF together with the C-terminal region of 15-LOX-2 in place of its complete ORF (Fig.3 B). This time, five useful chimera cDNAs were obtained as follows: chimera VII switched at Phe562, chimera VIII at Pro569, chimera IX at Gly584, chimera X at Ala586, and chimera XI at Val598 (Fig. 4). After expression in HeLa cells, all of these chimeras exhibited 15-lipoxygenase activity (data not shown). This allowed the positional determinant to be narrowed down to the amino acids between Val598 and Leu610. In this region, aside from an Ile/Leu substitution that we did not investigate, the mouse 8-LOX sequence differs from 15-LOX-2 only in the series of amino acids from Ser600 to His604 inclusive. The cluster of amino acids in positions 600–604 of the mouse 8-LOX, SSSYH, differ from the corresponding residues in human 15-LOX-2, ATCDV (Fig. 4). By site-directed mutagenesis using the primers shown in TableI, adjacent pairs of amino acids in 8-LOX were substituted with the corresponding amino acids in 15-LOX-2. As before, the resulting chimeras were expressed in HeLa cells, and their lipoxygenase activity was determined. The SS/AT mutant (data not shown) and the SS/TC mutant showed unchanged regiospecificity from wild type 8-LOX (Fig. 5, A andB). On the other hand, the SY/CD mutant produced mainly 8-HETE and a significant amount of 15-HETE product (Fig.5 C). The YH/DV mutant produced mainly 15-HETE and a small amount of 8-HETE (Fig. 5 D). Chiral HPLC analyses showed that both the 8-HETE produced by the SS/TC mutant and the 15-HETE by the YH/DV mutant were S isomers (Fig. 5, E andF). These data suggested that the positional determinants of the 8-LOX reside within the three amino acids, Ser602, Tyr603, and His604. To define further the positional determinants, Ser602, Tyr603, and His604 in 8-LOX were substituted with the corresponding amino acids in 15-LOX-2 (Cys, Asp, and Val, respectively) by site-directed mutagenesis using the primers shown in Table I. After expression in HeLa cells, the S602C mutant produced only 8S-HETE, indicating that this mutation has no effect on regiospecificity (Fig. 6 A). The Y603D mutant still produced mainly 8S-HETE, whereas there is also a significant amount of 15-HETE product (8S-HETE:15-HETE = 11:1) (Fig. 6 B). The H604V mutant gave significant amounts of 8- and 15-HETEs (38:62) (Fig.6 C), and furthermore, both products wereS-enantiomers (Fig. 6 D). Thus, His604appears to be a key amino acid determinant of positional specificity, and the neighboring Tyr603 seems to support it. Change at both positions is required to switch the 8-LOX to an enzyme with predominantly 15-lipoxygenase activity. In order to examine whether the Tyr-His pair can also function as an 8-preferring determinant in 15-LOX-2, the corresponding amino acids in 15-LOX-2 were mutated to Tyr or His. Switching of Asp602 to Tyr did not affect the positional specificity of the wild type 15-LOX-2 (Fig. 7 A), whereas the Val603 → His mutant gave almost equal amounts of 15- and 8-HETEs (Fig. 7 B). Furthermore, the double mutation of Asp602 and Val603 in 15-LOX-2 to the corresponding Tyr and His, respectively, yielded a mutant enzyme with a positional specificity of 70% 8-HETE and 30% 15-HETE (Fig.7 C). Again in these cases, additional normal phase and chiral HPLC analyses detected no other HETEs with different positional specificity or stereospecificity from those of wild type 8-LOX and 15-LOX-2 (data not shown). Initially, the presence of common restriction sites in the mouse 8-LOX and human 15-LOX-2 permitted ready exchange of their N and C termini. Two chimeras containing the C-terminal region of 15-LOX-2 exhibited significant 15S-lipoxygenase activity with no other products formed, suggesting that the C-terminal region of the 8-LOX contains positional determinants that distinguish the 8S and 15S specificities. To narrow this down, a variety of chimeric enzymes was prepared by the random mutagenesis method of Moore and Blakely (17.Moore K.R. Blakely R.D. BioTechniques. 1994; 17: 130-136PubMed Google Scholar). The two cDNAs to be interchanged are cloned into a single plasmid with the sequences lying in series, separated by an intervening linker containing two unique restriction sites. After the double enzyme digest at the linker site, the linearized plasmid is transfected into E. coli. Because of the mismatching ends, the bacteria are unable to effect repair by re-ligation. Instead, the repair systems align the two related sequences and reconstitute chimeric sequences with a homologous region of one sequence exchanged with the other. Repair of the linearized construct gives many different recombinants, mainly consisting of circularized plasmids containing a single chimeric species of cDNA. As a refinement of this approach, we placed the full-length 8-LOX cDNA in series with only the C-terminal part of 15-LOX-2, thus effectively focusing the switching onto the C-terminal region. From analysis of the various C-terminal chimeras, a cluster of 5 amino acids was identified (SSSYH, positions 600–604 of the mouse 8-LOX) that conferred 15-lipoxygenase activity on the murine 8-LOX. Further site-directed mutagenesis showed that His604 is the major positional determinant as its mutation to valine led to formation of almost comparable amounts of 15- and 8-products, both of which were pure S-isomers (Fig. 6 D). The nearly complete conversion of positional specificity observed in the YH/DV double mutant indicated that Tyr603 augments the 8Sspecificity favored by His604 (Fig. 5 D). The reverse substitutions in the human 15-LOX-2 produced the opposite effects, with the double mutant having primarily 8-lipoxygenase activity (Fig. 7 C). Three serines in this region do not affect the positional specificity. Our approach to identification of the positional determinants was independent of structural considerations. The results immediately beg the question, where do these critical amino acids lie in the enzyme three-dimensional structure? Although three-dimensional data are not available on the mouse 8-LOX or human 15-LOX-2, the primary structures of all the mammalian lipoxygenases show an unambiguous alignment in the region encompassing Tyr603 and His604(Fig. 8). Consequently, the positions of the corresponding residues in the x-ray structure of the rabbit reticulocyte 15-LOX should predict the approximate location of these residues (Fig. 9). The reticulocyte 15-LOX residues (Leu589 and Gln590) lie in the catalytic domain, on helix 21, on the opposite side of the iron from the β-barrel domain (5.Gillmor S.A. Villaseñor A. Fletterick R. Sigal E. Browner M.F. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1997; 4: 1003-1009Crossref PubMed Scopus (390) Google Scholar).Figure 9Location of the two residues equivalent to the 8-LOX/15-LOX-2 positional determinants in the x-ray structure of the rabbit reticulocyte lipoxygenase. From alignment of primary structures, the equivalent amino acids in the reticulocyte structure are Leu589 and Gln590 (Fig. 8). These arise from helix 21; Leu589 projects out of helix 21 and away from the viewpoint of this figure, whereas Gln590 projects down and away. The two residues protrude into a potential open pocket on the far side of helix 21 that leads down to the iron. This view of the enzyme is identical to that used before in describing the amino acid environment of the iron (1.Brash A.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 23679-23682Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1114) Google Scholar); the iron is shown here as theblack ball. This structure of the reticulocyte lipoxygenase is available under Protein Data Bank code 1LOX (5.Gillmor S.A. Villaseñor A. Fletterick R. Sigal E. Browner M.F. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1997; 4: 1003-1009Crossref PubMed Scopus (390) Google Scholar).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) The non-heme iron of the catalytic domain is surrounded by five amino acids lying approximately at the corners of an octahedron, with the sixth position open, or in some structures occupied by a water molecule (3.Minor W. Steczko J. Stec B. Otwinowski Z. Bolin J.T. Walter R. Axelrod B. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 10687-10701Crossref PubMed Scopus (392) Google Scholar). This open side of the iron also corresponds to the area where an inhibitor was bound in the x-ray crystal structure of the reticulocyte 15-LOX enzyme (5.Gillmor S.A. Villaseñor A. Fletterick R. Sigal E. Browner M.F. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1997; 4: 1003-1009Crossref PubMed Scopus (390) Google Scholar). The Leu589/Gln590 in the reticulocyte 15-LOX structure stand back about 15–20 Å from this open face of the iron (Fig. 9). This is somewhat further away from the iron than usually anticipated for substrate binding. Nonetheless, the linear length of arachidonic acid, ≈24 Å, is easily sufficient to reach this area. Assuming that the residues Tyr603/His604 of the murine 8-LOX lie in very approximately the same position as the Leu-Gln of the reticulocyte LOX structure, we can infer that they may have direct contact with the substrate and/or they may alter the positions of the helices that help form the putative substrate binding pocket in this region. When the amino acid alignments are extended to include plant lipoxygenases, there are lower overall similarities to the mouse 8-LOX and 15-LOX-2. Nonetheless, alignments utilizing either the clustal or Jotun-Hein algorithms of the DNAStar program identify Ile746/Ser747 of the soybean l-1 isozyme as the residues corresponding to Tyr603/His604 of the mouse 8-LOX (Fig. 8). These soybean amino acids lie in helix 21 (2.Boyington J.C. Gaffney B.J. Amzel L.M. Science. 1993; 260: 1482-1486Crossref PubMed Scopus (452) Google Scholar) in approximately the equivalent positions identified in the reticulocyte LOX structure. The change from 8S to 15S oxygenation would appear to entail a major alteration in specificity, yet it can be accounted for by a relatively simple change in binding of the substrate. For all lipoxygenases, the same stereochemical relationship pertains between the initial hydrogen abstraction and the reaction with molecular oxygen, namely that hydrogen removal from the CH2group between two cis double bonds occurs on one face of the substrate and oxygen reacts on the opposite face (20.Hamberg M. Samuelsson B. J. Biol. Chem. 1967; 242: 5329-5335Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). This antarafacial “rule” applies to all lipoxygenases tested (at least 10 different enzymes, including the mouse 8-LOX (21.Hughes M.A. Brash A.R. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1991; 1081: 347-354Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar)), and it should apply to each of the selective oxygenations of the 8-LOX, the 15-LOX-2, and the chimeras. Fig. 10 illustrates how a reorientation of the substrate can allow 8S or 15S oxygenation through stereochemically equivalent hydrogen abstractions and reactions with molecular oxygen. This change in binding provides a simple and straightforward mechanism that can account for the apparently major shift in positional specificity. There is ample precedent for this model in the lipoxygenase literature (e.g. Refs. 22.Egmond M.R. Vliegenthart J.F.G. Boldingh J. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1972; 48: 1055-1060Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar and 23.Schwarz K. Borngräber S. Anton M. Kühn H. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 15327-15335Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). The appropriateness of the model is further supported by the fact that the single amino acid mutants produce both 8S- and 15S-hydroperoxides, andonly these products (Fig. 6, C and D). There were no products at intermediary positions or products of opposite stereoconfiguration. This all but eliminates the possibility of a frameshift type of binding change (5.Gillmor S.A. Villaseñor A. Fletterick R. Sigal E. Browner M.F. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1997; 4: 1003-1009Crossref PubMed Scopus (390) Google Scholar) in which the substrate sinks deeper into the active site pocket as oxygenation specificity changes between C-15 and C-8. A potential role of the individual amino acids in substrate binding is speculative. The basic side chain of His604 could be a strong acceptor for the polar carboxyl group of the substrate fatty acid, whereas Tyr603 could support the substrate binding through hydrogen bonding and/or π-π interaction with the C terminus. Mutation of Tyr603 and His604 to Asp and Val, respectively, changes the character of the polarity and introduces a negative charge. This charge reversal might encourage a major repositioning of the substrate carboxyl group and hence promote the type of change proposed in Fig. 10. It is notable, however, that the experiments with single amino acid substitutions include the expression of the Tyr-Val (neutral) and Asp-His (acid-base) mutants; both of these enzymes produced mixtures of 8S- and 15S-hydroperoxides. It might be concluded, therefore, that in the context of the similar active sites of the 8-LOX and 15-LOX, substitutions in these key positions alter the contacts between amino acids on adjacent helices, the consequence being a change in the available space for substrate binding. This indirect effect may determine the shift in specificity. As noted in the Introduction, the molecular mechanisms determining the positional specificity in lipoxygenases have been approached before mainly using enzymes that exhibit frameshift differences in specificity. Several 12S-LOX and 15S-LOX-1 have received the most attention. Sequence comparisons led to the identification of residues of differing size that might influence the available space in the substrate binding pocket (6.Sloane D.L. Leung R. Craik C.S. Sigal E. Nature. 1991; 354: 149-152Crossref PubMed Scopus (180) Google Scholar). The evidence suggests that making more space is associated with oxygenation further along the carbon chain and, assuming a tail-first projection of the substrate into the active site, produces a change from 15Sto 12S specificity. These previously identified positional determinants do not seem to be applicable directly to 8-LOX and 15-LOX-2. Either the previously identified residues are not conserved in 8-LOX and 15-LOX-2 (this applies to Refs. 6.Sloane D.L. Leung R. Craik C.S. Sigal E. Nature. 1991; 354: 149-152Crossref PubMed Scopus (180) Google Scholar and 8.Gan Q.-F. Browner M.F. Sloane D.L. Sigal E. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 25412-25418Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar) or they are conserved but are present in both enzymes (7.Borngräber S. Kuban R.-J. Anton M. Kühn H. J. Mol. Biol. 1996; 264: 1145-1153Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). More recently, an amino acid was identified from modeling and sequence comparisons that could change a plant 13S-LOX to 9S-LOX specificity (24.Hornung E. Walther M. Kühn H. Feussner I. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 4192-4197Crossref PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar). This change is more akin to the positional specificity issues with the enzymes we have been studying. In both instances the change in LOX specificity must involve a turning around of the substrate in the active site. The residue identified in the plant enzyme is His608 of the cucumber lipid body 13-LOX. (Owing to the longer N-terminal sequence of plant lipoxygenases, this is roughly equivalent to position 420 in the mammalian enzymes.) Due to the weak percent identities of plant and mammalian lipoxygenases in this region, location of the equivalent residues in the 8-LOX and 15-LOX-2 is problematic; the alignments point to residues within a few amino acids of the mammalian consensus Gly-Gly-Gly-Gly motif that is not found in the plant enzymes. From sequence alignments, there appears to be a strong possibility that the residues we identified in the mouse 8-LOX will have an influence on the specificity of other mammalian lipoxygenases. This applies especially to the mammalian 5-LOX enzymes, as they conserve the histidine equivalent to His604 of the mouse 8-LOX (Fig. 8). A potential role of this 5-LOX histidine in positional specificity has been speculated upon before on the basis of sequence alignment and modeling studies (10.Prigge S.T. Boyington J.C. Gaffney B.J. Amzel L.M. Proteins Struct. Funct. Genet. 1996; 24: 275-291Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). In addition, the conserved tryptophan just before the histidine in the 5-LOX primary structures has a related character to Tyr603 of the 8-LOX. The likeness between the 5-LOX and 8-LOX is all the more compelling because both C-5 and C-8 oxygenations involve a similar mode of substrate binding (10.Prigge S.T. Boyington J.C. Gaffney B.J. Amzel L.M. Proteins Struct. Funct. Genet. 1996; 24: 275-291Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar, 23.Schwarz K. Borngräber S. Anton M. Kühn H. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 15327-15335Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar), differing only in a frameshift along the carbon chain. Mutation studies of these amino acids of mammalian 5-LOX would be interesting. We thank Brenda Leake for excellent technical assistance in expression experiments using HeLa cells and vaccinia virus."

The ability of Cd2+ ions to inhibit channels was used as the estimate of accessibility. The distribution of Cd2+ accessibility is consistent with an α-helical structure of M2. The apparent surface of reactivity is broad, and the most reactive residues correspond to the solvent-accessible residues in the bacterial KcsA channel crystal structure. In several mutants, single channel measurements indicated that inhibition occurred by a single transition from the open state to a zero-conductance state. Analysis of currents expressed from mixtures of control and L164C mutant subunits indicated that at least three cysteines are required for coordination of the Cd2+ ion. Application of phosphatidylinositol 4,5-diphosphate to inside-out membrane patches stabilized the open state of all mutants and also reduced cadmium sensitivity. Moreover, the Cd2+ sensitivity of several mutants was greatly reduced in the presence of inhibitory ATP concentrations.

Fibroblasts from HPS-2 patients exhibited a drastic reduction in AP-3 cellular content due to enhanced degradation of its β3A subunit, as well as increased trafficking of lysosomal membrane proteins through the plasma membrane en route to late endosomal/lysosomal compartments (8.Dell'Angelica E.C. Shotelersuk V. Aguilar R.C. Gahl W.A. Bonifacino J.S. Mol. Cell. 1999; 3: 11-21Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (576) Google Scholar). It is therefore likely that HPS-2 arises from impairment of protein transport to lysosomes as well as to lysosome-related organelles such as melanosomes and platelet dense granules. Finally, some HPS patients do not bear any detectable mutation in HPS1, ADTB3A,or any other AP-3 subunit gene (8.Dell'Angelica E.C. Shotelersuk V. Aguilar R.C. Gahl W.A. Bonifacino J.S. Mol.

Obvious candidates for the gene(s) mutated in these patients are those affected in a number of additional mouse models of HPS (13.Swank R.T. Novak E.K. McGarry M.P. Rusiniak M.E. Feng L.

The predicted protein (HPS1p) from both humans and mice has no sequence homology to any other known protein (9.Oh J. Bailin T. Fukai K. Feng G.H. Ho L. Mao J.I. Frenk E. Tamura N. Spritz R.A. Nat.

Theoretical analysis of the 700-amino acid form of human HPS1p predicted the existence of two membrane-spanning domains comprising residues 79–95 and 369–396 (9.Oh J. Bailin T. Fukai K. Feng G.H.

Such a polypeptide would be expected to be a bitopic integral membrane protein, with both the amino- and carboxyl-terminal segments (residues 1–78 and 397–700, respectively) facing the cytoplasm and the intervening loop (residues 96–368) facing the luminal/extracellular side of the membrane.

The sequences of both human and mouse HPS1p contain several potential dileucine-based motifs (9.Oh J. Bailin T. Fukai K. Feng G.H. Ho L. Mao J.I. Frenk E. Tamura N. Spritz R.A. Nat.

The presence of such motifs has led to speculation that HPS1p might be targeted to late endosomal/lysosomal compartments, including melanosomes and platelet dense granules. The role that HPS1p would play in these compartments remains unknown. In this work, we sought to identify and characterize biochemically the endogenous HPS1p from human cells in culture. We report that, contrary to expectations, HPS1p is not an integral membrane protein but exists as both cytosolic and peripheral membrane species. We also show that cells deficient in HPS1p do not display the abnormal trafficking of lysosomal membrane proteins described previously for HPS-2 cells (8.Dell'Angelica E.C. Shotelersuk V.

Cell. 1999; 3: 11-21Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (576) Google Scholar) and reported herein for fibroblasts derived from the murine AP-3 mutants (and HPS models), pearl and mocha. These observations, together with the apparent lack of physical interaction between HPS1p and AP-3, suggest that HPS1p controls the biogenesis or function of lysosome-related organelles by a mechanism different from that involving the AP-3 complex. Primary cultures of skin fibroblasts (GM00037F and GM00316A) and B-lymphoblastoid cell lines (GM00130C and GM00131B) derived from normal individuals, as well as fibroblasts (GM14609) and B-lymphoblastoid cells (GM14606) from an HPS-1 patient homozygous for a 16-bp duplication in exon 15 of theHPS1 gene (9.Oh J.

Genet. 1996; 14: 300-306Crossref PubMed Scopus (262) Google Scholar) were obtained from Coriell Cell Repositories (Camden, NJ). Fibroblasts from a second HPS-1 patient (Patient 8) with identical 16-bp duplication in HPS1, and from an HPS-2 patient (patient 40) with compound heterozygous mutations in the AP-3 complex β3A subunit, have been described previously (8.Dell'Angelica E.C.

B-lymphoblastoid cell lines established from patient 40, from a sibling of patient 40 also suffering from HPS-2 (patient 42), and from three unaffected relatives of patients 40 and 42 who are heterozygous carriers of the AP-3 β3A Δ390–410 deletion, have also been described (8.Dell'Angelica E.C.

Fibroblasts from various mouse strains were isolated by incubating, in 15-mm diameter plastic dishes, minced endodermis with complete Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 20% (v/v) fetal bovine serum, 2 mm glutamine, 100 μg/ml streptomycin, 100 IU/ml penicillin) for 3 days in a standard CO2 incubator. Adherent cells were then expanded by repeated passages in the same medium. The sources and culture conditions for the human cell lines M1, HeLa, H4 and Jurkat have been indicated in a previous report (19.Dell'Angelica E.C. Ooi C.E. Bonifacino J.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 15078-15084Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar). Megakaryocyte-derived MEG-01 cells and intestinal epithelial Caco-2 cells were from the American Tissue Culture Collection (Manassas, VA). MEG-01 cells were grown in suspension in RPMI 1640 medium supplemented with 15% (v/v) fetal bovine serum, 2 mm glutamine, 100 μg/ml streptomycin, and 100 IU/ml penicillin. Caco-2 cells were propagated in complete Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with non-essential amino acids and 1 mm sodium pyruvate. Melanoma-derived MNT-1 cells were a gift from Dr. Vincent Hearing (NIH, Bethesda, MD) and cultured in a medium similar to that of Caco-2 cells with the addition of 10% (v/v) AIM-V medium (Life Technologies, Inc., Gaithersburg, MD) and fungizone. The peptide sequence DDIQPSPRRARSSQN, corresponding to residues 253–267 of human HPS1p (9.Oh J. Bailin T. Fukai K. Feng G.H. Ho L. Mao J.I. Frenk E. Tamura N. Spritz R.A. Nat. Genet. 1996; 14: 300-306Crossref PubMed Scopus (262) Google Scholar) was used to generate a polyclonal rabbit antibody (Zymed Laboratories Inc., San Francisco, CA). The antibody was affinity purified (26.Harlow E. Lane D. Antibodies: A Laboratory Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1988Google Scholar) using the peptide as a ligand and 0.1 m glycine, pH 2.5, as elution buffer. Monoclonal rat antibody to mouse Lamp-1 (1D4B) was from the Developmental Studies Hybridoma Bank at the University of Iowa (Iowa City, IO). Monoclonal antibody to His6 tag was purchased from CLONTECH (Palo Alto, CA). The sources for all the other antibodies used in this study have been indicated elsewhere (8.Dell'Angelica E.C. Shotelersuk V. Aguilar R.C. Gahl W.A. Bonifacino J.S. Mol. Cell. 1999; 3: 11-21Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (576) Google Scholar). Metabolic labeling of cultured cells with [35S]methionine, preparation of Triton X-100 extracts, preparation and ultracentrifugation of detergent-free extracts, salt extraction of post-nuclear membranes, sucrose gradient fractionation, and immunoprecipitation-recapture were performed as described (18.Dell'Angelica E.C. Ohno H. Ooi C.E. Rabinovich E. Roche K.W. Bonifacino J.S. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 917-928Crossref PubMed Scopus (331) Google Scholar).

The following proteins were used as standards for sedimentation velocity experiments (s 20,w values given in parentheses): chicken ovalbumin (3.6 S), bovine serum albumin (4.6 S), bovine catalase (11.3 S), and horse spleen ferritin (16.5 S). Total RNA was isolated from cells in culture using the TRIzol reagent (Life Technologies, Inc., Gaithersburg, MD). Reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction was carried out using the Superscript kit from Life Technologies, Inc. with 5′ and 3′ primers comprising codons 495–502 and complementary to codons 694–701 of the predicted open reading frame of human HPS1 (9.Oh J. Bailin T. Fukai K. Feng G.H. Ho L. Mao J.I. Frenk E. Tamura N. Spritz R.A. Nat. Genet. 1996; 14: 300-306Crossref PubMed Scopus (262) Google Scholar), respectively. A construct encoding a His6-HPS1p fusion protein was generated by cloning in-frame the open reading frame of human HPS1 cDNA into the KpnI-XbaI sites of the pcDNA3.1.HisA vector (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA). The sequence of the construct was verified by DNA sequencing. Human HeLa or M1 cells grown on glass coverslips were transfected with the His6-HPS1p construct by using the FuGENE-6 reagent (Roche Molecular Biochemicals, Indianapolis, IN). Two days after transfection, cells were either fixed and processed for immunofluorescence (18.Dell'Angelica E.C. Ohno H. Ooi C.E. Rabinovich E. Roche K.W. Bonifacino J.S. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 917-928Crossref PubMed Scopus (331) Google Scholar) or used directly for antibody internalization experiments, as described (8.Dell'Angelica E.C. Shotelersuk V. Aguilar R.C. Gahl W.A. Bonifacino J.S. Mol. Cell. 1999; 3: 11-21Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (576) Google Scholar). Quantitation of antibody internalization in human or mouse fibroblasts and flow cytofluorometry of B-lymphoblasts were also performed as described previously (8.Dell'Angelica E.C. Shotelersuk V. Aguilar R.C. Gahl W.A. Bonifacino J.S. Mol. Cell. 1999; 3: 11-21Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (576) Google Scholar). To analyze the properties of HPS1p, we generated an affinity-purified, rabbit polyclonal antibody to residues 253–267 of its deduced amino acid sequence (9.Oh J. Bailin T. Fukai K. Feng G.H. Ho L. Mao J.I. Frenk E. Tamura N. Spritz R.A. Nat. Genet. 1996; 14: 300-306Crossref PubMed Scopus (262) Google Scholar). This antibody failed to detect endogenous HPS1p from HeLa cells or M1 fibroblasts by either immunoblotting or immunofluorescence microscopy, but could detect using the same methods a His6-HPS1p fusion protein expressed by transfection in these cells (data not shown; see, for example, Fig. 4 A). In order to detect the endogenous protein, we resorted to an immunoprecipitation-recapture protocol, which had been used successfully to study low-abundance cellular proteins (e.g. see Ref. 28.Dell'Angelica E.C. Mullins C. Bonifacino J.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 7278-7285Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (218) Google Scholar). HeLa cells metabolically labeled with [35S]methionine were extracted with a Triton X-100-containing buffer, and the resulting extract was subjected to nondenaturing immunoprecipitation with the anti-HPS1 antibody. Proteins in the immunoprecipitate were then denatured by heating in the presence of SDS and dithiothreitol, diluted 20-fold in Triton X-100 buffer containing iodoacetamide (to quench excess dithiothreitol), and subjected to a second immunoprecipitation with the same anti-HPS1 antibody. This procedure resulted in the isolation of a major radiolabeled protein of apparent molecular mass ∼80 kDa (Fig.1 A), a value which was in close agreement with the calculated mass of the largest predicted HPS1p species (79.3 kDa, Ref. 9.Oh J. Bailin T. Fukai K. Feng G.H. Ho L. Mao J.I. Frenk E. Tamura N. Spritz R.A. Nat. Genet. 1996; 14: 300-306Crossref PubMed Scopus (262) Google Scholar). A minor species of slightly higher electrophoretic mobility was also observed (Fig. 1 A); the nature of this species remains to be determined. Specificity controls confirmed that the species recognized by the anti-HPS1 antibody represented endogenous HPS1p. First, no bands were detected using two irrelevant control antibodies in the second immunoprecipitation (Fig.1 A). In addition, virtually no protein bands were detected when the immunoprecipitation-recapture procedure was performed on fibroblasts from two unrelated HPS-1 patients homozygous for a 16-bp duplication in HPS1 (Fig. 1 B); this mutation had been shown to affect the stability of the HPS1 mRNA (9.Oh J. Bailin T. Fukai K. Feng G.H. Ho L. Mao J.I. Frenk E. Tamura N. Spritz R.A. Nat. Genet. 1996; 14: 300-306Crossref PubMed Scopus (262) Google Scholar, 29.Boissy R.E. Zhao Y. Gahl W.A. Lab. Invest. 1998; 78: 1037-1048PubMed Google Scholar) and predicted to result in very low cellular levels of HPS1p. Fibroblasts from an AP-3 β3A-deficient HPS-2 patient were found to express normal levels of HPS1p (Fig. 1 B) and immunoprecipitation-recapture experiments failed to reveal interaction between HPS1p and the AP-3 complex (Fig. 1 C), suggesting that HPS1p and AP-3 are not part of a stable complex.Figure 1Detection of endogenous HPS1p by immunoprecipitation-recapture. A, HeLa cells were metabolically labeled with [35S]methionine for 22 h and extracted with lysis buffer containing 1% (w/v) Triton X-100 (18.Dell'Angelica E.C. Ohno H. Ooi C.E. Rabinovich E. Roche K.W. Bonifacino J.S. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 917-928Crossref PubMed Scopus (331) Google Scholar). The extract was then subjected to a first immunoprecipitation (1st IP) with anti-HPS1 antibody. The immunoprecipitate was subsequently heated at 95 °C for 5 min in the presence of SDS and dithiothreitol, diluted 20-fold with lysis buffer, and subjected to a second immunoprecipitation (2ndIP) with the same anti-HPS1 antibody or with either of two different control antibodies. Proteins were then analyzed by 4–20% gradient SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and fluorography. The positions of molecular mass markers are indicated on theleft. B, whole cell extracts from primary cultures of fibroblasts derived from a normal individual, two patients homozygous for a 16-bp duplication in HPS1 (HPS-1) and a patient with compound heterozygous mutations in the β3A subunit of AP-3 (HPS-2), were prepared and analyzed as described in Aby using in both immunoprecipitation and recapture steps the antibody to HPS1p (upper panel) or an antibody to a control cellular protein (lower panel). C, immunoprecipitation-recapture experiment, performed as in A,in which antibodies to HPS1p (this study) or the ς3 subunit of AP-3 (18.Dell'Angelica E.C. Ohno H. Ooi C.E. Rabinovich E. Roche K.W. Bonifacino J.S. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 917-928Crossref PubMed Scopus (331) Google Scholar) were used alternatively for the first or second immunoprecipitations. Notice that the HPS1p and AP-3 ς3 proteins were recovered only when their respective antibodies were used in both immunoprecipitation steps.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Previous Northern blot experiments suggested that the HPS1 mRNA is expressed in most cell types, although it was barely detectable in HeLa cells (9.Oh J. Bailin T. Fukai K. Feng G.H. Ho L. Mao J.I. Frenk E. Tamura N. Spritz R.A. Nat. Genet. 1996; 14: 300-306Crossref PubMed Scopus (262) Google Scholar). We analyzed a panel of human cell lines for expression of HPS1 at both the mRNA and protein levels. As shown in Fig. 2, both the protein and the mRNA were detected in a variety of human cell lines, including M1 (fibroblast), MNT-1 (melanoma), H4 (neuroblastoma), MEG-01 (megakaryocyte), Jurkat (T cell), and Caco-2 (intestinal epithelial). Although HPS1p levels were variable among the different cell lines, we did not find a cell line that expressed levels much higher than those observed in HeLa cells (Fig. 2). Of particular interest was the fact that the amount of HPS1p was not significantly higher in a melanoma and a megakaryocyte cell lines, both of which are derived from cell types where the HPS1p deficiency gives rise to characteristic manifestations of HPS (i.e. deficiency in pigmented melanosomes and platelet dense granules). These experiments thus suggested that HPS1p is expressed ubiquitously among human cells. To examine the subcellular localization of HPS1p, [35S]methionine-labeled HeLa or M1 cells were mechanically disrupted in the absence of detergents and subjected to a simple fractionation procedure in which a post-nuclear supernatant was centrifuged for 90 min at 120,000 × g, and the resulting supernatant and pellet fractions were analyzed for the presence of HPS1p by immunoprecipitation-recapture. Following this procedure, approximately 70–80% of endogenous HPS1p was recovered in the supernatant, while the remainder was associated with the post-nuclear pellet (Fig. 3 A). Similar results were obtained when using repetitive ultracentrifugation steps to sediment any contaminating membranes that could remain in the 120,000 × g supernatant (data not shown). As expected, the lysosomal integral membrane protein, Lamp-1, was found exclusively in the post-nuclear pellet fraction (Fig. 3 A). The small amounts of HPS1p associated with membranes could be solubilized by extraction with 2 m NaCl (Fig. 3 B), indicating that this fraction of HPS1p behaved as a peripheral membrane protein. To estimate the size of the soluble form of HPS1p, a cytosolic extract of [35S]methionine-labeled HeLa cells was fractionated by ultracentrifugation on a sucrose density gradient, and the resulting fractions were subjected to immunoprecipitation-recapture with the anti-HPS1 antibody. As shown in Fig. 3 C, HPS1p was recovered i"
https://openalex.org/W1972049807,"Synaptosome-associated protein of 25 kDa (SNAP-25) is a presynaptic membrane protein that has been clearly implicated in membrane fusion in both developing and mature neurons, although its mechanisms of action are unclear. We have now identified a novel SNAP-25-interacting protein named SNIP. SNIP is a hydrophilic, 145-kDa protein that comprises two predicted coiled-coil domains, two highly charged regions, and two proline-rich domains with multiple PPXY and PXXP motifs. SNIP is selectively expressed in brain where it co-distributes with SNAP-25 in most brain regions. Biochemical studies have revealed that SNIP is tightly associated with the brain cytoskeleton. Subcellular fractionation and immunofluorescence localization studies have demonstrated that SNIP co-localizes with SNAP-25 as well as the cortical actin cytoskeleton, suggesting that SNIP serves as a linker protein connecting SNAP-25 to the submembranous cytoskeleton. By using deletion analysis, we have mapped the binding domains of SNIP and SNAP-25, and we have demonstrated that the SNIP-SNAP-25 association is mediated via coiled-coil interactions. Moreover, we have shown that overexpression of SNIP or its SNAP-25-interacting domain inhibits Ca2+-dependent exocytosis from PC12 cells. These results indicate that SNIP is involved in regulation of neurosecretion, perhaps via its interaction with SNAP-25 and the cytoskeleton.

Nature. 1994; 372: 55-63Crossref PubMed Scopus (1993) Google Scholar). In developing neurons, fusion of plasmalemmal precursor vesicles with the plasma membrane is thought to mediate membrane expansion at the growth cone (2.Pfenninger K.H. Friedman L.B. Brain Res. Dev. Brain Res. 1993; 71: 181-192Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). At mature nerve terminals, exocytotic fusion of synaptic vesicles with the plasma membrane releases neurotransmitters and initiates synaptic transmission (3.Sudhof T.C. Nature. 1995; 375: 645-653Crossref PubMed Scopus (1754) Google Scholar, 4.Bennett M.K. Curr. Opin. Neurobiol. 1997; 7: 316-322Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). Activity-dependent modulation of neurotransmitter release is an important mechanism underlying the processes of learning and memory, whereas dysregulated neurotransmitter release has been linked to several disorders of the nervous system such as depression and schizophrenia. Thus, elucidation of the molecular mechanisms that mediate and regulate neuronal exocytosis is crucial to our understanding of neuronal function and dysfunction as well as to the understanding of membrane trafficking in general. Synaptosome-associated protein of 25 kDa (SNAP-25)1 was identified 10 years ago as a brain-specific protein that is localized in the plasma membrane of nerve terminal (5.Oyler G.A. Higgins G.A.

Cell. 1999; 97: 165-174Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (355) Google Scholar). Furthermore, introduction of antibodies or synthetic peptides specific to SNAP-25 into synaptosomes or PC12 cells blocks Ca2+-dependent exocytosis (11.Banerjee A. Kowalchyk J.A. DasGupta B.R.

InDrosophila, SNAP-25 null mutation results in a complete loss of the evoked release, whereas the spontaneous release is unaffected, implicating a role for SNAP-25 in the stimulation-secretion coupling (13.Deitcher D.L. Stewart B.A. Burgess R.W. Schwarz T.L. Soc. Neurosci. Abstr. 1997; 23: 1170Google Scholar). In mice, coloboma (Cm/+) mutation that deletes a fragment of chromosome 2 encompassing the SNAP-25 gene leads to impaired neurotransmitter release, profound spontaneous hyperactivity, and learning deficits (14.Hess E.J.

During development, interfering with SNAP-25 expression using antisense oligonucleotides or botulinum neurotoxins prevents neurite elongation (19.Osen-Sand A. Catsicas M. Staple J.K. Jones K.A.

Despite the overwhelming evidence linking SNAP-25 to membrane fusion in both developing and mature neurons, it is not understood how SNAP-25 actually facilitates the fusion process. SNAP-25 (a t-SNARE) interacts with syntaxin (another t-SNARE) and synaptobrevin/VAMP (a v-SNARE) to form a ternary complex referred to as the core complex or the SNARE complex (21.Söllner T. Bennett M.K. Whiteheart S.W. Scheller R.H. Rothman J.E. Cell. 1993; 75: 409-418Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1564) Google Scholar, 22.Söllner T. Whiteheart S.W. Brunner M. Erdjument-Bromage H. Geromanos S. Tempest P. Rothman J. Nature. 1993; 362: 318-324Crossref PubMed Scopus (2589) Google Scholar). According to the SNARE hypothesis, the core complex formation between cognate v- and t-SNAREs underlies the specificity of membrane fusion (21.Söllner T. Bennett M.K. Whiteheart S.W. Scheller R.H. Rothman J.E. Cell. 1993; 75: 409-418Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1564) Google Scholar, 22.Söllner T. Whiteheart S.W. Brunner M. Erdjument-Bromage H. Geromanos S. Tempest P. Rothman J.

However, this view has been challenged by the localization studies demonstrating that the t-SNAREs SNAP-25 and syntaxin are not localized exclusively at the release sites of target membranes (24.Garcia E.P. McPherson P.S. Chilcote T.J. Takai K. De Camilli P. J. Cell Biol. 1995; 129: 105-120Crossref PubMed Scopus (239) Google Scholar, 25.Galli T. Garcia E.P. Mundigl O. Chilcote T.J. De Camilli P.

De Camilli P. J. Cell Biol. 1995; 129: 105-120Crossref PubMed Scopus (239) Google Scholar, 25.Galli T. Garcia E.P. Mundigl O. Chilcote T.J. De Camilli P. Neuropharmacology. 1995; 34: 1351-1360Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar), and some of them are even localized on synaptic vesicles (26.Walch-Solimena C. Blasi J. Edelmann L.

A. 1997; 94: 6197-6201Crossref PubMed Scopus (230) Google Scholar). Furthermore, it has been shown that various v- and t-SNAREs can form stable ternary complexes rather promiscuously (28.Gotte M. von Mollard G.F. Trends Cell Biol. 1998; 8: 215-218Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar, 29.Pelham H.R. Exp.

Chem. 1999; 274: 5649-5653Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (255) Google Scholar). Recent structural studies revealed that the core complex consists of a parallel four-stranded helical bundle formed by one helix each from syntaxin and synaptobrevin and two helices from SNAP-25 (31.Hanson P.I.

The core complex is extremely stable and resistant to denaturation by SDS and high temperature (35.Hayashi T. McMahon H.T. Yamasaki S. Binz T. Hata Y. Südhof T.C. Niemann H. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 5051-5061Crossref PubMed Scopus (658) Google Scholar, 36.Fasshauer D. Otto H. Eliason W.K. Jahn R. Brunger A.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 28036-28041Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (273) Google Scholar). It has been proposed that the energy released upon formation of such an unusually stable complex provides a driving force for membrane fusion (31.Hanson P.I. Roth R. Morisaki H. Jahn R. Heuser J.E. Cell. 1997; 90: 523-535Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (663) Google Scholar, 37.Hanson P.I. Heuser J.E. Jahn R. Curr. Opin. Neurobiol. 1997; 7: 310-315Crossref PubMed Scopus (332) Google Scholar). Consistent with this view, in vitro studies have shown that assembly of the core complex from recombinant synaptobrevin, SNAP-25, and syntaxin reconstituted in liposomes leads to spontaneous mixing of lipid bilayer membranes (38.Weber T. Zemelman B.V. McNew J.A. Westermann B. Gmachl M. Parlati F. Söllner T. Rothman J.E. Cell. 1998; 92: 759-772Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1989) Google Scholar). Most recently, it was reported that the core complex formation is triggered by Ca2+ and coupled directly to the membrane fusion process in PC12 cells (10.Chen Y, A. Scales S.J. Patel S.M. Doung Y.-C. Scheller R.H. Cell. 1999; 97: 165-174Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (355) Google Scholar). However, evidence from studies in other fusion systems, namely the yeast vacuole fusion and the cortical vesicle fusion in sea urchin eggs, argues against such a direct association of the core complex with the fusion step (39.Ungermann C. Sato K. Wickner W. Nature. 1998; 396: 543-548Crossref PubMed Scopus (278) Google Scholar, 40.Coorssen J.R. Blank P.S. Tahara M. Zimmerberg J. J.

Chem. 1998; 273: 33667-33673Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). Despite these controversies, it is generally agreed that additional proteins and events are required to regulate and catalyze the fusion reaction (38.Weber T. Zemelman B.V. McNew J.A. Westermann B.

To identify regulatory proteins that control the activity of SNAP-25 and to determine the molecular mechanisms by which SNAP-25 mediates membrane fusion, we performed a search in rat brain for proteins that interact with SNAP-25 using a yeast two-hybrid screen. We report here the isolation and characterization of a novel protein called SNIP (SNAP-25-interacting protein). SNIP is a brain-specific protein of about 145 kDa that specifically interacts with the N-terminal t-SNARE coiled-coil domain of SNAP-25. Our data suggest that SNIP may be involved in anchoring SNAP-25 to the membrane cytoskeleton and have a role in regulating neurotransmitter release. The bait plasmid, pPC97-SNAP25, was constructed by subcloning the entire open reading frame of mouse SNAP-25b (5.Oyler G.A. Higgins G.A. Hart R.A. Battenberg E. Billingsley M. Bloom F.E. Wilson M.C. J. Cell Biol. 1989; 109: 3039-3052Crossref PubMed Scopus (684) Google Scholar) into the pPC97 vector (42.Chevray P.M. Nathans D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 5789-5793Crossref PubMed Scopus (476) Google Scholar, 43.Li X.-J. Li S.-H. Sharp A.H. Nuclfora Jr., F.C.. Schilling G. Lanahan A. Worley P. Snyder S.H. Ross C.A. Nature. 1995; 378: 398-402Crossref PubMed Scopus (531) Google Scholar). For the two-hybrid screen, the yeast strain CG-1945 (CLONTECH) was transformed sequentially with pPC97-SNAP25 and a rat hippocampal/cortical two-hybrid cDNA library (43.Li X.-J. Li S.-H. Sharp A.H. Nuclfora Jr., F.C.. Schilling G. Lanahan A. Worley P. Snyder S.H. Ross C.A. Nature. 1995; 378: 398-402Crossref PubMed Scopus (531) Google Scholar), using the lithium acetate method (44.Gietz R.D. Schiestl R.H. Methods Mol. Cell Biol. 1995; 5: 255-269Google Scholar). Positive clones were selected on 3-aminotriazole (5 mm, Sigma)-containing medium lacking leucine, tryptophan, and histidine and confirmed by a filter assay for β-galactosidase activity (45.Hannon G.J. Demetrick D. Beach D. Genes Dev. 1993; 7: 2378-2391Crossref PubMed Scopus (405) Google Scholar). Prey plasmids from positive clones were rescued and re-transformed into fresh yeast cells with the SNAP-25 bait or various control baits to confirm the specificity of the interaction. For analysis of SNIP-SNAP-25 interaction, deletion constructs of SNAP-25 were made by polymerase chain reaction and were subcloned into the pPC97 vector. The interactions of SNAP-25 deletion mutants with SNIP were tested in the yeast two-hybrid assay by using the HIS3 and β-galactosidase as the reporter genes. Quantitative β-galactosidase assay was performed on the yeast extracts by using the substrate chlorophenol red β-d-galactopyranoside as described previously (46.Li L. Suzuki T. Mori N. Greengard P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 1460-1464Crossref PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar). For cloning of the full-length SNIP, a rat hippocampal cDNA library in λZAPII (Stratagene) was screened using a partial cDNA probe of SNIP from the prey clone C53, according to standard procedures (47.Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. 2nd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar). The cDNA inserts from positive SNIP clones were sequenced multiple times on both strands, using an Applied Biosystems 373A DNA sequencer. An anti-SNIP antibody was raised in chicken against the synthetic peptide CPSRGSPVRQSFRKD, corresponding to amino acids 533–546 of SNIP. The N-terminal cysteine residue was added for the coupling purposes. The antibody was affinity purified using the immunogen peptide coupled to a SulfoLink column (Pierce). Other antibodies that were used in this study are as follows: anti-SNAP-25 (SMI 81, Sternberger Monoclonals, Inc.); anti-synaptophysin (clone SVP-38, Sigma) and anti-syntaxin 1 (HPC-1, Sigma); anti-actin (clone C4, Roche Molecular Biochemicals); anti-HA (HA.11, Berkeley Antibody Co.); and anti-FLAG (M5, Eastman Kodak Co.). The anti-synapsin antibody (G304) was a generous gift from A. Czernik (Rockefeller University). Total RNAs were extracted from various rat tissues using the TRIzol reagent (Life Technologies, Inc.) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Poly(A)+ mRNAs were isolated using the Oligotex mRNA purification system (Qiagen). Northern blot analysis was performed according to standard procedures (47.Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. 2nd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar), using a partial SNIP cDNA probe from the prey clone C53. For Western blot analysis, rat tissues were homogenized in 1% SDS and subjected to SDS-PAGE. The proteins were transferred onto nitrocellulose membranes and probed with the anti-SNIP and other antibodies. Antibody binding was detected by using the enhanced chemiluminescence system (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). The full-length SNIP-a and its fragments were subcloned in frame into the expression vector pGEX-5X-2 (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). After transformation of these fusion constructs into Escherichia coli BL21 cells, synthesis of fusion proteins was induced with isopropyl β-d-thiogalactopyranoside (0.1 mm) during the mid-logarithmic phase of bacteria growth (A 600 of 0.6). After 4 h of induction, bacteria were harvested and lysed. GST-SNAP-25 fusion protein was purified by affinity chromatography using the glutathione-agarose beads (Sigma). For binding experiments, rat brain homogenates were prepared by homogenizing the brains in 4 mm HEPES-NaOH, pH 7.4, and 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride followed by addition of an equal volume of 2× solubilization buffer (0.2 m NaCl, 4 mm HEPES-NaOH, pH 7.4, 1 mmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1% Triton X-100). After 4 h incubation at 4 °C under gentle rocking, insoluble material was removed by 30 min centrifugation at 120,000 × g. The brain homogenates were then incubated for 2 h at 4 °C under gentle rocking with various GST-SNIP fusion proteins immobilized on glutathione-agarose beads. After extensive washes with 1× solubilization buffer, the bound proteins were eluted by boiling in the Laemmli sample buffer and analyzed by SDS-PAGE and immunoblotting. Conventional molecular biological techniques (47.Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. 2nd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar) were used to generate the following expression constructs: pcDNA3.1-SNIP-a and pcDNA3.1-SNIP-b, which contain the full-length (including the 5′- and 3′-untranslated regions) SNIP-a and SNIP-b in the pcDNA3.1 vector, respectively; pCHA-SNIP-a, pCHA-SNIP-b, and pCHA-SNIP (C53), which direct the expression of N-terminal HA epitope-tagged, full-length SNIP-a, SNIP-b, and a SNIP fragment (residues 337–779), respectively; and pFLAG-SNIP-a and pFLAG-SNIP-b, which direct the expression of N-terminal FLAG epitope-tagged, full-length SNIP-a and SNIP-b, respectively. All recombinant sequences were determined to be free of polymerase chain reaction errors by DNA sequencing analysis. Transfections of HEK293 cells with various expression constructs were carried out using LipofectAMINE (Life Technologies, Inc.). Transfected cells were either harvested at 48 h post-transfection for Western blot analysis or selected with 0.5 mg/ml G418 (Geneticin, Life Technologies, Inc.) and grown until sufficient cells were obtained for subsequent subcellular fractionation experiments. PC12 cells were grown on poly-l-lysine-coated glass coverslips and differentiated for 1–2 days with nerve growth factor (50 ng/ml). The cells were fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde and processed for indirect immunofluorescence microscopy as described previously (48.Cameron P.L. Sudhof T.C. Jahn R. De Camilli P. J.

The following antibodies were used: the chicken anti-SNIP antibody, a mouse anti-SNAP-25 antibody (SMI 81, Sternberger Monoclonals, Inc.), and secondary antibodies coupled with fluorescein or Texas Red (Jackson ImmunoResearch Labs, Inc.). Cells were stained simultaneously for F-actin with Texas Red-labeled phalloidin (Molecular Probes). Stained cells were analyzed by using a Leica TCS-NT confocal microscope, and the images were processed using Adobe Photoshop 5.0 (Adobe Systems, Inc.). Subcellular fractionations of rat brain or SNIP-transfected HEK293 cells into membrane and cytosol fractions were performed as described (50.Hsu S.C. Ting A.E. Hazuka C.D. Davanger S. Kenny J.W.

The following extraction solutions were used: 1.5 m NaCl, 3 mKSCN, 1% CHAPS, 1% CHAPS with 1 m NaCl, 4% Triton X-100, 2% SDS, 2% N-lauroylsarcosine (Sarkosyl), 4 murea, 8 m urea, or 0.1 mNa2CO3 at pH 11.5. For sucrose gradient flotation analysis, brain membranes were resuspended in 55% sucrose in gradient buffer (20 mm HEPES, pH 7.4, 150 mmNaCl and 1 mm dithiothreitol) in a volume of 0.4 ml. The resuspended membranes were placed at the bottom of an ultracentrifuge tube and overlaid with 4.8 ml of a linear 25–52.5% sucrose gradient. Flotation was carried out for 16 h at 165,000 × gin a Beckman SW50.1 rotor. Following centrifugation, the gradient was divided into 18 fractions and analyzed by Western blot analysis. For cytoskeleton association studies, rat brains or SNIP-transfected HEK293 cells were lysed in a cytoskeleton stabilizing buffer and separated into a low speed cytoskeleton fraction, a high speed cytoskeleton fraction, and a soluble fraction, according to the procedure of Stamet al. (52.Stam J.C. Sander E.E. Michiels F. van Leeuwen F.N. Kain H.E.T. van der Kammen R.A. Collard J.G. J. Biol.

The cytoskeleton fractions were further analyzed by extraction studies using 1.5 m NaCl, 4% Triton X-100, 4 m urea, or 0.1 mNa2CO3 at pH 11.5 as described (52.Stam J.C. Sander E.E.

For synaptosomal localization studies, rat brain homogenates were fractionated into crude synaptosome fractions according to the procedure of Huttner et al. (53.Huttner W.B. Schiebler W. Greengard P. De Camilli P. J. Cell Biol. 1983; 96: 1374-1388Crossref PubMed Scopus (879) Google Scholar). The washed crude synaptosome (P2′) pellet fraction was then subfractionated on a three-step Percoll gradient into myelin, mitochondria, and purified synaptosome fractions as described previously (54.Dunkley P.R.

The purified synaptosome fraction (PG3) was further fractionated into the synaptosomal membranes (LP1), synaptic vesicle (LP2), and cytosol (LS2) fractions as described (53.Huttner W.B. Schiebler W. Greengard P. De Camilli P. J. Cell Biol. 1983; 96: 1374-1388Crossref PubMed Scopus (879) Google Scholar). All protein samples were subjected to SDS-PAGE and Western blot analysis. Exponentially growing PC12 cells were harvested and resuspended at a density of 2 × 107 cells/ml in the Opti-MEM medium (Life Technologies, Inc.). The cell suspension (0.4 ml) was then co-transfected with 10 μg of pXGH5 (56.Selden R.F. Howie K.B. Rowe M.E. Goodman H.M. Moore D.D. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1986; 6: 3173-3179Crossref PubMed Scopus (470) Google Scholar) encoding human growth hormone and 30 μg of test plasmid by electroporation using a Bio-Rad Gene Pulser at 250 V and 960 microfarads in a 0.4-cm cuvette. Following electroporation, the cells were placed into the growth medium (46.Li L. Suzuki T. Mori N. Greengard P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 1460-1464Crossref PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar) and transferred to the collagen-coated 12-well dishes at a density of 0.8 × 106 cells/well. Release experiments were performed 48 h after electroporation. PC12 cells were washed with a physiological salt solution (PSS (in mm): 145 NaCl, 5.6 KCl, 2.2 CaCl2, 0.5 MgCl2, 10 glucose, 15 HEPES, pH 7.4). The cells were then incubated for 15 min at 37 °C in PSS, PSS containing 56 mm KCl and 95 mm NaCl, or PSS containing 300 μm ATP. The amounts of GH released into the medium and retained in the cells were determined by radioimmunoassay (Nichols Institute). To identify proteins that interact with SNAP-25, we screened a rat hippocampal/cortical cDNA library by yeast two-hybrid selection, using the full-length mouse SNAP-25b as bait. DNA sequencing analysis revealed that some of the positive clones encode known SNAP-25-interacting proteins such as syntaxin 1B and syntaxin 4 (data not shown), confirming the validity of the two-hybrid screen. One of the positive clones, clone 53, was shown to encode part of a new protein called SNIP (Fig.1 A). Re-transformation experiments confirmed that SNIP interacts specifically with SNAP-25 but not with irrelevant baits (data not shown). Since SNAP-25 shares similar structure and function with a ubiquitously expressed protein named SNAP-23/syndet (57.Ravichandran V. Chawla A. Roche P.A. J. Biol.

We performed far-Western analysis and identified a 60-kDa protein (P60) that interacted with cPLA2α in a Ca2+-dependent manner. Peptide microsequencing revealed that purified P60 was identical to vimentin, a major component of the intermediate filament. The interaction occurred between the C2 domain of cPLA2α and the head domain of vimentin. Immunofluorescence microscopic analysis demonstrated that cPLA2α and vimentin colocalized around the perinuclear area in cPLA2α-overexpressing human embryonic kidney 293 cells following A23187 stimulation. Forcible expression of vimentin in vimentin-deficient SW13 cells augmented A23187-induced arachidonate release. Moreover, overexpression of the vimentin head domain in rat fibroblastic 3Y1 cells exerted a dominant inhibitory effect on arachidonate metabolism, significantly reducing A23187-induced arachidonate release and attendant prostanoid generation. These results suggest that vimentin is an adaptor for cPLA2α to function properly during the eicosanoid-biosynthetic process.

PLA2 plays crucial roles in diverse cellular responses, including phospholipid digestion and metabolism, host defense, signal transduction, and probably apoptosis. PLA2 provides precursors for the biosynthesis of eicosanoids, such as prostaglandins (PGs) and leukotrienes, when the hydrolyzed fatty acid is arachidonic acid (AA); platelet-activating factor when the sn-1 position of phosphatidylcholine contains an alkyl ether linkage; and some bioactive lysophospholipids, such as lysophosphatidic acid. As oversynthesis of these lipid mediators causes inflammation and tissue disorders, it is important to elucidate the mechanisms that regulate the functions of PLA2. Mammalian tissues and cells generally contain more than one PLA2, each of which is regulated independently and plays distinct roles. There are three large families of mammalian PLA2s, cytosolic PLA2 (cPLA2), secretory PLA2, and Ca2+-independent PLA2, and the roles of type IV cPLA2α and secretory types IIA and V sPLA2 in lipid mediator synthesis have been studied extensively (1.Leslie C.C.

Six D.A. Dennis E.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 2184-2191Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (161) Google Scholar), and two critical serine residues (Ser505 and Ser727), which undergo activation-directed phosphorylation (25.Borsch-Haubold A.G.

The C2 domain is responsible for translocation of cPLA2α from the cytosol to the membrane compartment and exhibits significant homology with the C2 domains of several proteins, such as protein kinase C, GTPase-activating protein, synaptotagmin, and phospholipase C, all of which bind to phospholipid membranes in a Ca2+-dependent manner (22.Nalefski E.A.

The carboxyl-terminal region mediates the Ca2+-independent enzymatic catalysis, which involves Ser228 at the active site (26.Sharp J.D. Pickard R.T. Chiou X.G. Manetta J.V. Kovacevic S. Miller J.R.

Interestingly, a number of enzymes involved in AA metabolism, such as COX-1 and -2, 5-LO, and 5-LO-activating protein, are also localized in the nuclear envelope and endoplasmic reticulum (27.Morita I.

In this study, we carried out far-Western screening in an attempt to determine how cPLA2α translocates specifically to the perinuclear particles and identified a protein that interacted with cPLA2α. We found that vimentin, a major component protein of intermediate filaments, interacted with the amino-terminal region of cPLA2α in a Ca2+-dependent manner. Further experiments demonstrated that cPLA2α and vimentin colocalized in Ca2+ ionophore-stimulated, but not unstimulated, human embryonic kidney 293 cells stably transfected with cPLA2α. Introduction of vimentin into a vimentin-deficient SW13 cell line restored cPLA2α-dependent AA release in response to a Ca2+ ionophore, whereas introduction of the vimentin head domain, to which cPLA2α bound via its C2 domain, into rat fibroblastic 3Y1 cells reduced it. These results suggest that vimentin is involved in the regulation of cPLA2α in the AA metabolic pathway.DISCUSSIONAs has been shown by a number of studies, there is no doubt that cPLA2α regulates the initial step of AA metabolism in response to stimuli that mobilize intracellular Ca2+ (1.Leslie C.C.

Six D.A. Dennis E.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 2184-2191Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (161) Google Scholar). However, the molecular mechanism whereby cPLA2α is directed to the intracellular membrane compartments, the perinuclear membranes in particular, in activated cells remains largely obscure.While searching for proteins that physically and functionally interact with cPLA2α, Wu et al. (49.Wu T. Angus W. Yao X.-L. Logun C. Shelhamer J.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 17145-17153Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar) recently identified, by means of the yeast two-hybrid system, a cellular protein, p11, that associated with the carboxyl-terminal portion of cPLA2α. Functional analysis revealed that p11 inhibited cPLA2α activity both in vitro and in vivo, suggesting that it acts as a negative regulator of cPLA2α. In this study, we found that cPLA2α interacted with a major intermediate filament protein, vimentin, which is expressed abundantly in the perinuclear regions of mesenchymal cells and a variety of cultured cells (40.Fuchs E. Weber K. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1994; 63: 345-382Crossref PubMed Scopus (1272) Google Scholar). This interaction occurred between the C2 domain of cPLA2α and the head domain of vimentin. In agreement with the dependence of their interaction on Ca2+, confocal microscopic analysis revealed that they colocalized around the perinuclear area in A23187-stimulated but not unstimulated cells. Most importantly, overexpression of full-length vimentin augmented cPLA2α-initiated AA metabolism, whereas that of the vimentin head domain exerted a dominant-negative effect. Collectively, these results suggest that vimentin represents a functional adaptor for cPLA2α that determines the intracellular localization and thereby modifies the function of cPLA2α, depending on the changes in the cytoplasmic Ca2+ levels during cellular activation.The C2 domain of cPLA2α, like those of protein kinase C and synaptotagmin, behaves as a Ca2+-dependent lipid-binding domain. Recent crystal structural analysis revealed that the C2 domain of cPLA2α captured two Ca2+ions at one end of the domain between three loops, CBR1, CBR2, and CBR3 (36.Perisic O. Fong S. Lynch D.E. Bycroft M. Williams R.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 1596-1604Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (240) Google Scholar, 37.Bittova L. Sumandea M. Cho W. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 9665-9672Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar), and the Ca2+ ions interacted directly with the phosphate moiety of a lipid head group. In this study, we showed that Asp43 (which resides in CBR1) and Asp93 (which resides in CBR3) in the C2 domain are involved in the cPLA2α-vimentin interaction. This is an important finding, because mutation of either of these two aspartates in the native C2 domain reduced Ca2+ binding, eventually leading to reduce phospholipid binding and enzyme activity (37.Bittova L.

SP-A concentrations are influenced by both cell-specific and ubiquitous nuclear proteins that regulate SP-A gene transcription in a cell-selective and temporally regulated manner. In this work, a consensus GATA-binding site (GBS) was identified at positions −69 to −64 of the mouse SP-A gene. The transcriptional activity of wild-type SP-A reporter constructs in HeLa cells was increased 5–10-fold when cotransfected with a GATA-6 expression plasmid. Deletion of the GBS completely blocked transactivation by GATA-6. Transfection of a construct expressing GATA-6-engrailed fusion protein inhibited basal expression of the SP-A/chloramphenicol acetyltransferase construct in MLE-15 cells. Nuclear extract proteins from MLE-15 cells bound to the GBS in the mouse SP-A gene, and a supershifted band was detected with a GATA-6-specific antibody. Transactivation of the wild-type SP-A constructs by GATA-6 increased transcriptional activity 7–10-fold, whereas thyroid transcription factor-1 (TTF-1) increased the activity of these constructs 12–18-fold. The effects of cotransactivating with both GATA-6 and TTF-1 expression constructs were additive. However, mutation of the TTF-1-binding sites alone or in combination decreased GATA-6 transactivation. Likewise, mutation of the GBS blocked TTF-1 activation of the SP-A promoter. In situ hybridization demonstrated GATA-6 mRNA in the peripheral epithelial cells of fetal mouse lung, consistent with the sites of SP-A expression.

In humans, SP-A is expressed at high levels by respiratory epithelial cells of the lung, being secreted by subsets of tracheobronchial, bronchiolar, and alveolar cells in vivo. SP-A binds to phospholipids, contributing to tubular myelin formation, and influences surfactant phospholipid secretion and re-uptake in vitro (1.Mason R.J. Greene K. Voelker D.R. Am. J.

SP-A gene expression is regulated in a complex manner at the level of gene transcription and mRNA stability (for review, see Ref. 11.Mendelson C.R. Gao E. Li J. Young P.P. Michael L.F. Alcorn J.L. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1998; 1408: 132-149Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). Like surfactant proteins B and C, SP-A transcription is dependent upon the action of thyroid transcription factor-1 (TTF-1), a homeodomain protein of the Nkx family of transcription factors (12.Bohinski R.J.

Recently, in situ hybridization studies demonstrated that GATA-5 and GATA-6 are expressed in developing mouse lung (17.Morrisey E.E. Ip H.S. Tang Z. Lu M.M. Parmacek M.S. Dev. Biol. 1997; 183: 21-36Crossref PubMed Scopus (214) Google Scholar). The GATA family of transcription factors includes at least six polypeptides whose temporal and spatial expression is highly distinct. GATA-6 mRNA was detected in respiratory epithelial cells of developing lung tubules, consistent with a potential role in lung cell differentiation or gene regulation. Embryonic stem cells with a targeted disruption of the Gata-6 gene failed to contribute to bronchial epithelial cells in the lung, supporting the concept that GATA-6 may play a role in the differentiation of subsets of lung cells (18.Morrisey E.E. Tang Z. Sigrist K. Lu M.M. Jiang F. Ip H.S. Parmacek M.S. Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 3579-3590Crossref PubMed Scopus (541) Google Scholar). The recent finding that GATA-6 activates TTF-1 reporter gene transcription provides further support for the concept that GATA-6 plays a role in the regulation of respiratory epithelial cell differentiation or function, either regulating TTF-1 expression or directly influencing transcription of surfactant proteins (19.Shaw-White J.R. Bruno M.D. Whitsett J.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 2658-2664Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). This study was designed to test whether GATA family members influence mouse SP-A gene transcription in vitro. Cell transfection and electrophoretic mobility shift assay of native and mutant mouse SP-A gene sequences demonstrated that GATA-6 activates SP-A gene transcription in vitro. The SP-A constructs used in this study are presented in Fig.1. The mouse SP-A sequences used to generate the various constructs were isolated and cloned as described previously (20.Korfhagen T.R. Bruno M.D. Glasser S.W. Ciraolo P.J. Whitsett J.A. Lattier D.L. Wikenheiser K.A. Clark J.C. Am. J. Physiol. 1992; 263: L546-L554PubMed Google Scholar). The murine SP-A gene promoter construct pCPA0.9 (−907 to +45) was made by isolating a 952-base pairSspI-PstI fragment from pCPA1.4 and using linker ligation to create a 5′-HindIII site. The product was cloned into pCPA-0 to generate pCPA0.9. The SP-A promoter construct pCPA0.45 was generated by PCR using linker primers containing 5′-HindIII and 3′-PstI sites to create fragment −399 to +45. The promoter constructs pCPA0.1 (−70 to +45) and pCPA0.1m (−60 to +45) were generated by PCR using linker primers containing 5′-HindIII and 3′-PstI sites. The TTF-1 site-directed mutants were generated by PCR using pCPA0.3 (−256 to +45) as template, as described previously (15.Bruno M.D. Bohinski R.J. Huelsman K.M. Whitsett J.A. Korfhagen T.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 6531-6536Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (238) Google Scholar). Oligomers were made to each of the three of the TTF-1-binding sites, replacing each with a restriction enzyme sequence. The TTF-1 site located at positions −159 to −154 was changed to a SalI site; the site located at positions −135 to −130 was changed to a NcoI site; and the TTF-1 site at positions −125 to −120 was changed to aBamHI restriction site. These oligomers were then used in PCRs with pCPA0.3 as template. These products were digested as appropriate and cloned into pCPA-0. The mutation of the GATA-binding site was generated by PCR using pCPA0.45 as template and replacing the 6-base pair GATA-binding site (GBS), TGATAG, with an EcoRI site, GAATTC. Additional constructs from positions −907 and −399 to +45 were generated from the 5′-end by digesting the linker-ligatedHindIII site and from the 3′-end using a BstEII site within the flanking region 5′ to the TTF-1-binding elements (TBEs). HeLa cells were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium and 10% fetal calf serum. MLE-15 cells were cultured in HITES medium (RPMI 1640 containing 10 mm HEPES, 5 μg/ml insulin, 10 μg/ml transferrin, 3 × 10−8m sodium selenite, 1 × 10−8m β-estradiol, and 200 mm l-glutamine) and transferred to Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium and 10% fetal calf serum as described previously (15.Bruno M.D. Bohinski R.J. Huelsman K.M. Whitsett J.A. Korfhagen T.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 6531-6536Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (238) Google Scholar). MLE-15 cells express TTF-1, GATA-6, SP-A, and surfactant protein B and C mRNAs. Cells were transfected using calcium precipitates prepared with 7.5 pmol of test plasmid and 4 pmol of pCMV/β-galactosidase. For GATA-6 transactivation experiments in HeLa cells, each 10-cm dish was treated with a precipitate prepared using 7.5 pmol of promoter/CAT fusion plasmid, 4 pmol of pCMV/β-galactosidase, and 1 pmol of either the empty expression vector (pCMV1.1) or an expression vector containing the entire GATA-6 open reading frame (pCMV/GATA-6, a kind gift from Dr. J. Molkentin, Children's Hospital Medical Center, Cincinnati, OH). Cells were maintained at 37 °C for 48–72 h, and the lysates were assayed for β-galactosidase and CAT activities as described previously (15.Bruno M.D. Bohinski R.J. Huelsman K.M. Whitsett J.A. Korfhagen T.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 6531-6536Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (238) Google Scholar). MLE-15 cells were also transiently transfected with an expression plasmid (pcDNA3/GATA-6-engrailed) that contains the DNA-binding domain of GATA-6 and the inhibitory regulatory domain encoded by theDrosophila engrailed gene. All data are presented as means ± S.D. MLE-15 and HeLa nuclear extracts were prepared using a modified mini-extract procedure. Nuclear extraction procedures were performed with ice-cold reagents. Confluent monolayers from six 10-cm-diameter dishes were washed twice with 10 ml of phosphate-buffered saline (pH 7.2) and harvested by scraping into 1 ml of phosphate-buffered saline, and the cells were pelleted in a chilled 1.5-ml microcentrifuge tube at 3000 rpm for 5 min. The pellet was washed once in phosphate-buffered saline and re-pelleted as described above. The cell pellet was resuspended in 1 packed cell volume of fresh lysis buffer (10 mm Hepes (pH 7.9), 10 mm KCl, 0.1 mm EDTA, 1.5 mmMgCl2, 0.2% (v/v) Nonidet P-40, 1 mmdithiothreitol, and 0.5 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride), and the cells were lysed during a 5-min incubation with occasional vortexing. A nuclear pellet was obtained by microcentrifugation at 3000 rpm for 5 min and was resuspended in 1 packed nuclear volume of fresh extract buffer (20 mm Hepes (pH 7.9), 420 mmNaCl, 0.1 mm EDTA, 1.5 mm MgCl2, 25% (v/v) glycerol, 1 mm dithiothreitol, and 0.5 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride). Nuclei were extracted during a 10-min incubation with occasional gentle vortexing. Extracted nuclei were pelleted in a microcentrifuge at 14,000 rpm for 10 min. The supernatant recovered was saved as the extracted nuclear protein. These nuclear extracts were quick-frozen and stored at −80 °C. Single-stranded oligonucleotides were annealed at a concentration of 10 mm in annealing buffer (10 mm Tris (pH 7.5), 10 mmMgCl2, and 50 mm NaCl) in a 95 °C dry heat block and then slowly cooled to room temperature. TheA 260 was determined, and dilutions of this mixture were made in TE buffer (10 mm Tris (pH 8.0) and 1 mm EDTA). These double-stranded oligomers were gel-purified for labeling. For use as a probe in EMSA, 20 μl of the annealed oligomer was gel-purified using 4% Bio-Gel and a MERmaid kit (Bio 101, Inc.) as specified by the manufacturer. The A 260was determined, and 1.5 pmol of annealed and gel-purified oligonucleotide was end-labeled using [γ-32P]ATP and T4 polynucleotide kinase. End-labeled probe was purified from unincorporated nucleotide using an Amersham Pharmacia Biotech Nick column and recovered in 400 μl of TE buffer. Nuclear extract (5.0–10.0 μg of protein) and, when indicated, unlabeled oligonucleotide competitor DNA were preincubated in 12.5 μl of EMSA buffer (12 mm Hepes (pH 7.9), 4 mm Tris-Cl (pH 7.9), 50 mm KCl, 5 mm MgCl2, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 75 ng/μl poly(dI-dC) (Roche Molecular Biochemicals), and 0.2 mm fresh phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride) for 10 min on ice. Oligonucleotide probe (100,000 dpm) was added to the mixture and incubated for an additional 20 min on ice. For antibody supershift assays, 1.0 μl of a 1:10 dilution of GATA-6 antibody (the kind gift of Dr. Kenneth Walsh, Tufts University, Boston) was added following addition of the nuclear extract and incubated as described above. The DNA-protein complexes were resolved from free probe by nondenaturing polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. Five percent gels (29:1 acrylamide/bisacrylamide, 0.5× TBE buffer (44.5 mm Tris, 44.5 mm borate, and 1 mmEDTA (pH 8.3)), and 2.5% (v/v) glycerol; 1.5-mm thick) were run in 0.5× TBE running buffer at constant current (30 mA) for ∼90 min. Gels were blotted onto Whatman No. 3MM paper, dried, and exposed to x-ray film. In situ hybridization analyses for GATA-6 mRNA were performed on tissues from fetal mice on day 17.5 of gestation using 35S-labeled cDNA probes following methods similar to those used previously (20.Korfhagen T.R. Bruno M.D. Glasser S.W. Ciraolo P.J. Whitsett J.A. Lattier D.L. Wikenheiser K.A. Clark J.C. Am. J. Physiol. 1992; 263: L546-L554PubMed Google Scholar). A 3.1-kilobase pair mouse GATA-6 cDNA template was utilized to generate35S-labeled probe, which was reduced to an average size of 200 base pairs by alkaline hydrolysis. Cotransfection of HeLa cells with the pCMV/GATA-6 expression vector and SP-A/CAT expression constructs containing sequences from positions −907 to +45 of the mouse SP-A gene (20.Korfhagen T.R. Bruno M.D. Glasser S.W. Ciraolo P.J. Whitsett J.A. Lattier D.L. Wikenheiser K.A. Clark J.C. Am. J. Physiol. 1992; 263: L546-L554PubMed Google Scholar) resulted in activation of reporter gene expression in all constructs (Fig.2). Comparison of the mouse (20.Korfhagen T.R. Bruno M.D. Glasser S.W.

Kahn A. Eur. J. Biochem. 1992; 206: 613-623Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar) SP-A sequences demonstrated a conserved GBS at positions −69 to −64 of the mouse gene (Fig. 3). Deletion of region −69 to −64 abrogated GATA-6-dependent activity, suggesting that the stimulatory effects of GATA-6 were dependent on an intact GBS located at positions −69 to −64 (Fig. 2, see pCPA0.1m). Although both GATA-6 and GATA-5 expression vectors stimulated the activity of the pCPA0.9 construct, GATA-6 was consistently more active than GATA-5 (data not shown). HeLa cells do not express GATA-6 mRNA, likely accounting for the more marked activation of the SP-A promoter construct (5–10-fold) by GATA-6 in HeLa cells. The pCPA0.9 and pCPA0.45 constructs were also cotransfected with pCMV/GATA-6 in MLE-15 pulmonary adenocarcinoma cells. Whereas the basal activity of the SP-A/CAT constructs was considerably higher in MLE-15 cells than in HeLa cells, SP-A promoter activity was stimulated only 2–3-fold by cotransfection with the GATA-6 expression vector (data not shown), a finding likely related to the presence of endogenous GATA-6 activity in this cell line (19.Shaw-White J.R. Bruno M.D. Whitsett J.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 2658-2664Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar).Figure 3Conservation of a GATA-binding site in the rat and mouse SP-A genes. Region −70 to −1 of the mouse SP-A gene was 90% identical to region −70 to −1 of the rat SP-A gene (21.Lacaze-Masmonteil T. Fraslon C. Bourbon J. Raymondjean M. Kahn A. Eur. J. Biochem. 1992; 206: 613-623Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). A consensus GATA-binding site is depicted in boldface, and the TATAAA sequence is boxed. Nucleotide differences areunderlined.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) To test for endogenous GATA activity in MLE-15 cells, the 0.45-kilobase pair SP-A/CAT construct was cotransfected into MLE-15 cells with pCMV/GATA-6-engrailed. The latter contains the GATA-6 DNA-binding domain, but the activation domain has been replaced by the repressor domain ofengrailed, thereby inhibiting GATA-6-dependent transcription. pCMV/GATA-6-engrailed inhibited SP-A/CAT activity in the MLE-15 cells in a dose-dependent manner, supporting the concept that endogenous GATA activity, at least in part, contributed to the higher activity of SP-A/CAT reporter constructs in the MLE-15 cell line (Fig. 4). Inspection of the 5′-flanking region of the mouse and rat SP-A genes revealed the presence of an extensive region of homology that included the sequence located at positions −69 to −64 (TGATAG) (Fig. 3). This sequence is homologous to a consensus GATA-binding site. To more precisely define the function of this element and to determine whether GATA-6 bound to the region, EMSA was performed with extracts prepared from adult mouse type II epithelial cells and MLE-15 cells. Migration of the 32P-labeled GATA-6 oligonucleotide was retarded by either mouse type II cell or MLE-15 cell nuclear extracts. Co-incubation of nuclear extracts with antibody to GATA-6 caused a clear supershift, consistent with the binding of GATA-6 to the EMSA probe containing the GBS (−64 to −69) (Fig.5). Mutation of the GBS (−64 to −69) by substitution of the sequence GAATTC for TGATAG in the pCPA0.45 construct resulted in complete inhibition of the GATA-6-dependent activation of the SP-A reporter construct (Fig. 6, compare pCPA0.45-G with pCPA0.45). Thus, the element that mediates the stimulatory effects of GATA-6 is located at positions −64 to −69 in the 5′-region of the SP-A gene. Since Nkx2 and GATA family members are known to participate in the regulation of a number of genes in target tissues, we tested whether TTF-1 (Nkx2.1) influences GATA-6 activation of the SP-A/CAT reporter constructs in vitro. Cotransfection of TTF-1 and GATA-6 expression plasmids in HeLa cells markedly increased the activity of the cotransfected pCPA0.45/CAT constructs (25-fold) (Fig.7). The effect of cotransfection with TTF-1 and GATA-6 expression plasmids was approximately additive (Fig.7). To further clarify the nature of the effects of GATA-6 and TTF-1, SP-A/CAT constructs containing mutations in TTF-1-binding sites were cotransfected with pCMV/GATA-6 in HeLa cells. Mutation of three TTF-1 sites, singly or in combination, markedly reduced GATA-6- and TTF-1-dependent transactivation of the pCPA0.45 constructs, supporting the concept that optimal GATA-6-dependent activity required the binding of TTF-1 to TTF-1-binding elements in this region of the promoter (Fig.8 A). Likewise, mutation of the GBS blocked TTF-1 transactivation of the pCPA0.45 construct (Fig.8 B). Thus, TTF-1 and GATA-6 transactivation depends on both intact GATA- and TTF-1-binding sites.Figure 8GATA-6 and TTF-1 do not transactivate SP-A promoter constructs with site-specific mutations of TTF-1 - or GATA-binding sites. A, constructs were cotransfected into HeLa cells with pCMV/GATA-6. The relative CAT activity of the respective constructs is presented as -fold induction compared with constructs transfected without pCMV/GATA-6. pCPA0.45 is the wild-type construct, and pCPA0.45T designates constructs mutagenized in the respective TBEs (see Fig. 1). B, constructs were cotransfected into HeLa cells with the expression plasmid pCMV/TTF-1. The relative CAT activity of the respective constructs is presented as -fold activation after transfection with pCMV/TTF-1 compared with constructs transfected without pCMV/TTF-1. Data are representative of at least three separate experiments.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Since other potential GATA-binding sites were noted upstream of positions −69 to −64, the larger SP-A construct, containing additional consensus GATA-binding sites, was tested. Cotransfection of pCMV/GATA-6 with pCPA0.9 alone or with a GBS mutation at gene positions −69 to −64 demonstrated that GATA-6 activity was mediated by the proximal GBS (Fig. 9). GATA-6 mRNA was localized in developing mouse lung by in situhybridization (Fig. 10). On day 17.5, GATA-6 mRNA was detected in peripheral airway epithelial cells overlapping with the sites of expression of SP-A and TTF-1 mRNAs, providing further support for the potential role of GATA-6 in the regulation of expression of SP-A in prenatal lung development. Unlike TTF-1 or SP-A, GATA-6 mRNA was not confined to respiratory epithelial cells in the lung, being detected in epithelial, mesenchymal, and vascular tissues at this time in development. GATA-6 mRNA was detected in respiratory epithelial cells in fetal lung at sites coincident with those of SP-A mRNA and protein. GATA-6 bound to an element (GBS) located at positions −64 to −69 in the 5′-flanking region of the SP-A gene, enhancing the activity of the SP-A gene reporter constructs. Mutation of the GBS or transfection of MLE-15 cells with a construct expressing a GATA-6-engrailedfusion protein inhibited the activity of the SP-A promoter constructs. Mutagenesis of the GBS inhibited TTF-1-dependent activation of the SP-A promoter, and the activity of the GBS was influenced by mutations in any of three distinct TTF-1 regulatory elements located within the 5′-flanking region of the SP-A gene. Taken together, these findings support a role for GATA-6 in the regulation of the transcriptional activity of the mouse SP-A gene. GATA-6 was consistently more active than GATA-5 in the activation of the SP-A promoter construct. Although both GATA-5 and GATA-6 are detected in developing lung (18.Morrisey E.E. Tang Z. Sigrist K. Lu M.M. Jiang F. Ip H.S. Parmacek M.S. Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 3579-3590Crossref PubMed Scopus (541) Google Scholar), only GATA-6 is expressed in respiratory epithelial cells, prior to and coincident with SP-A mRNA and protein. Previous studies demonstrated that GATA-6 and surfactant protein mRNAs are expressed in freshly isolated adult type II epithelial cells (19.Shaw-White J.R. Bruno M.D. Whitsett J.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 2658-2664Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). In contrast, GATA-5 is expressed primarily in the mesenchyme of developing lung, as assessed by in situ hybridization, at sites that do not overlap with SP-A (17.Morrisey E.E. Ip H.S. Tang Z. Lu M.M. Parmacek M.S. Dev. Biol. 1997; 183: 21-36Crossref PubMed Scopus (214) Google Scholar). In the present study, GATA-6 was also detected by EMSA in MLE-15 cells and mouse type II cells. Type II epithelial cells isolated from adult mice and immortalized MLE-15 cells express TTF-1, GATA-6, and various surfactant protein mRNAs (19.Shaw-White J.R. Bruno M.D. Whitsett J.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 2658-2664Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). Early in lung morphogenesis, the distribution of GATA-6 and TTF-1 mRNAs is similar, with both being detected in progenitor cells of the respiratory epithelium. TTF-1 plays a critical role in lung morphogenesis and in the regulation of surfactant proteins in respiratory epithelial cells. Therefore, GATA-6 may influence SP-A expression indirectly, by enhancing TTF-1 gene transcription, or directly, by binding to and activating the promoters of the surfactant protein genes (19.Shaw-White J.R. Bruno M.D. Whitsett J.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 2658-2664Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). Recent studies from this laboratory demonstrated that GATA-6 also directly influences both surfactant protein B and C transcription. 2M. D. Bruno, T. R. Korfhagen, C. Liu, E. E. Morrisey, and J. A. Whitsett, unpublished observations. GATA-6 is a member of the zinc finger family of transcription factors. The family members GATA-1 and GATA-2 were initially identified as important factors in hematopoietic precursor cells, where they play a role in differentiation and gene expression during erythropoiesis. More recently, other GATA family members were identified in non-hematopoietic tissues during embryonic development. GATA-4, -5, and -6 mRNAs were detected in various tissues in the embryo, including heart, gastrointestinal tract, and lung (22.Laverriere A.C. MacNeill C. Mueller C. Poelmann R.E. Burch J.B. Evans T. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 23177-23184Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 23.Morrisey E.E. Ip H.S. Lu M.M. Parmacek M.S. Dev. Biol. 1996; 177: 309-322Crossref PubMed Scopus (385) Google Scholar). In the present work, both GATA-6 and TTF-1 mRNAs were detected at overlapping sites in respiratory epithelial cells of developing lung (24.Zhou L. Lim L. Costa R.H. Whitsett J.A. J. Histochem. Cytochem. 1996; 44: 1183-1193Crossref PubMed Scopus (245) Google Scholar), although GATA-6 mRNA was detected in both epithelial and mesenchymal compartments in the lung. GATA-6 bound to the SP-A promoter in a region of the SP-A gene containing a number of TTF-1-binding sites that were previously shown to be involved in SP-A gene transcription (15.Bruno M.D. Bohinski R.J. Huelsman K.M. Whitsett J.A. Korfhagen T.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 6531-6536Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (238) Google Scholar). Mutation of any of the TTF-1-binding sites in the proximal region of the promoter inhibited GATA-6 stimulation of the SP-A/CAT constructs, suggesting that the effects of GATA-6 were dependent upon TTF-1 and its interaction with TTF-1-binding elements in the SP-A gene. It is unclear whether TTF-1 and GATA-6 factors function independently or are involved in a higher order DNA-protein complex that may be involved in SP-A gene regulation. In analogous models, GATA-4 and Nkx2.5 appear to directly interact in regulating expression of the atrial natriuretic peptide gene promoter (25.Durocher D. Charron F. Warren R. Schwartz R.J. Nemer M. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 5687-5696Crossref PubMed Scopus (548) Google Scholar, 26.Shiojima I. Komuro I. Oka T. Hiroi Y. Mizuno T. Takimoto E. Monzen K. Aikawa R. Akazawa H. Yamazaki T. Kudoh S. Yazaki Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 8231-8239Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar) and of the α-actin gene promoter in cardiac tissue (27.Sepulveda J.L. Belaguli N. Nigam V. Chen C. Nemer M. Schwartz R.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 3405-3415Crossref PubMed Scopus (276) Google Scholar). In those studies, Nkx2.5 and GATA-4 formed a complex that activated gene transcription. Whereas Durocher et al. (25.Durocher D. Charron F. Warren R. Schwartz R.J. Nemer M. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 5687-5696Crossref PubMed Scopus (548) Google Scholar) suggested that GATA-4 transactivation required DNA binding to a proximal GBS in the atrial natriuretic peptide gene promoter, Shiojima et al. (26.Shiojima I. Komuro I. Oka T. Hiroi Y. Mizuno T. Takimoto E. Monzen K. Aikawa R. Akazawa H. Yamazaki T. Kudoh S. Yazaki Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 8231-8239Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar) suggested that the synergistic activity of Nkx2.5 and GATA-4 did not require direct binding of GATA-4 to DNA. In the present study, mutation of either the GBS or TTF-1-binding sites in the mouse SP-A gene reduced transactivation by the other factor. It remains unclear whether direct or indirect interactions between TTF-1 and GATA-6 mediate their cooperative effects on SP-A promoter activity. We were unable to demonstrate direct binding or coprecipitation of TTF-1 and GATA-6 in MLE-15 cell extracts using antibodies to GATA-6 or TTF-1 (data not shown). It is possible that the respective antibodies bind epitopes required for protein-protein interactions. In vivo, GATA-6 and SP-A mRNAs are co-localized in developing lung, and both are expressed in isolated adult type II epithelial cells (19.Shaw-White J.R. Bruno M.D. Whitsett J.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 2658-2664Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). The early expression of GATA-6 in the development of respiratory tubules supports its potential role in lung morphogenesis and gene regulation. Similarly, GATA-6 mRNA are expressed at the highest levels in developing progenitor cells of the intestinal epithelium and developing cardiomyocytes (27.Sepulveda J.L. Belaguli N. Nigam V. Chen C. Nemer M. Schwartz R.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 3405-3415Crossref PubMed Scopus (276) Google Scholar, 28.Gao X. Sedgwick T. Shi Y. Evans T. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 2901-2911Crossref PubMed Scopus (202) Google Scholar), suggesting a critical role of GATA-6 in developing tissues. Recent findings in chimeric mice generated from GATA-6−/− and GATA-6+/+ embryonic stem cells demonstrated that GATA-6−/− cells do not contribute to the formation of the bronchiolar epithelium in chimeric mice (18.Morrisey E.E. Tang Z. Sigrist K. Lu M.M. Jiang F. Ip H.S. Parmacek M.S. Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 3579-3590Crossref PubMed Scopus (541) Google Scholar). In contrast, GATA-6−/− embryonic stem cells are fully competent to contribute to other fetal tissues. This finding suggests a unique role for GATA-6 in the morphogenesis of bronchiolar tissues. Further clarification of the role of GATA-6 in lung morphogenesis and gene regulation will require site-specific alterations in GATA-6 since mice lacking GATA-6 fail to survive to stages in which lung development is initiated (18.Morrisey E.E. Tang Z. Sigrist K. Lu M.M. Jiang F. Ip H.S. Parmacek M.S. Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 3579-3590Crossref PubMed Scopus (541) Google Scholar). SP-A is subjected to precise temporal, spatial, and tissue-specific regulation mediated, at least in part, at the transcriptional level. Although TTF-1 plays a critical role in lung cell-selective expression of SP-A, mutations of the TBEs lead to enhanced SP-A reporter gene transcription in vitro. This enhanced gene transcription is also influenced by combinatorial interactions of other transcription factors. For example, B-Myb binds to the murine SP-A promoter and influences SP-A gene transcription, with the highest transactivation occurring with phosphorylated B-Myb (29.Bruno M.D. Whitsett J.A. Ross G.F. Korfhagen T.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 27523-27528Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar). In contrast to findings with the rat and mouse SP-A genes, expression of rabbit, baboon, and human SP-A genes is enhanced by cAMP. Both basal and cAMP transcription of the rabbit and primate SP-A genes require binding of TTF-1, upstream factors 1a and b, unknown members of the steroid receptor family, and Kruppel family members (16.Li J. Gao E. Mendelson C.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 4592-4600Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar, 30.Gao E. Wang Y. Alcorn J.L. Mendelson C.R. J. Biol.

Alcorn J.L. Gao E. Mendelson C.R. Mol. Endocrinol. 1996; 10: 159-170PubMed Google Scholar). cAMP stimulates phosphorylation of TTF-1, enhancing transactivation of a baboon SP-A gene (30.Gao E. Wang Y. Alcorn J.L. Mendelson C.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 23398-23406Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). It is therefore increasingly apparent that SP-A gene transcription is controlled by complex interactions among cis-acting elements and multiple transcription factors, including GATA-6. This study demonstrates a role for GATA-6 in the regulation of the transcriptional activity of the mouse SP-A gene. Coexpression of GATA-6 and SP-A mRNAs during development and in adult type II epithelial cells supports a potential role for GATA-6 in the regulation of SP-A production, therefore influencing host defense and inflammatory responses in postnatal lung. We appreciate the assistance of Dr. Susan Wert in in situ hybridization, Iris Fink in tissue culture, and Ann Maher in manuscript preparation."

Osteocalcin expression is modulated by parathyroid hormone (PTH) and a variety of other factors. The cAMP-dependent protein kinase pathway has been shown previously to have an essential role in PTH signaling and regulation of osteocalcin expression. To determine the extent to which other pathways may also participate in osteocalcin expression, we used rat and human osteoblast-like cell lines to generate stably transfected clones in which the osteocalcin promoter was fused to a luciferase reporter gene. These clones were examined for their responsiveness to agents known to activate or interfere with protein kinase A (PKA)- and protein kinase C (PKC)-dependent pathways. We have found that forskolin, cAMP, and PTH, as well as insulin-like growth factor I (IGF-I) and basic fibroblast growth factor, all were effective in activating the osteocalcin promoter. Phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate (PMA) was also a strong inducer of the promoter, indicating that PKC plays a role in expression of osteocalcin. In combination with PTH or forskolin, the effect of PMA was additive to synergistic. Calphostin C, a selective inhibitor of PKC, decreased the PMA-, PTH-, and IGF-I-induced luciferase activity in a dose-dependent manner; a PKA inhibitor, H-89, also blocked the induction by PTH and IGF-I but not by PMA. We conclude that regulation of osteocalcin transcription is mediated by both PKA-dependent and PKC-dependent mechanisms and that the respective kinases reside on a linear or convergent pathway.

The osteocalcin promoter region contains a number of potential regulatory sequences that may be responsive to these factors. Also present are sequences that could confer species and tissue specificity (12.Stein G.S. van Wijnen A.J. Stein J.L. Lian J.B. Front. Biosci. 1998; 3: 849-864Crossref PubMed Scopus (5) Google Scholar, 13.Heinrichs A.A. Banerjee C. Bortell R. Owen T.A. Stein J.L. Stein G.S. Lian J.B. J. Cell.

Parathyroid hormone is a calcium-regulating peptide that plays a significant role in the maintenance of bone function (14.Fitzpatrick L.A. Bilezikian J.P. Bilezikian J.P. Raisz L.G. Rodan G.A. Principles of Bone Biology. Academic Press, Inc., San Diego1996: 339-346Google Scholar). A once-daily administration of PTH-(1–34) results in increased bone mineral density in normal and osteopenic bone in humans and animals (15.Finkelstein J.S Bilezikian J.P. Raisz L.G. Rodan G.A. Principles of Bone Biology. Academic Press, Inc., San Diego1996: 993-1005Google Scholar). This increase in bone density is correlated with enhanced osteoblast activity, leading to increased bone formation (16.Onyia J.E. Bidwell J. Herring J. Hulman J. Hock J.M. Bone. 1995; 17: 479-484Crossref PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar). While the mechanism of osteoblast activation by PTH is not fully understood, it is well established that the hormone action on target cells is mediated by binding of PTH to a G-protein-coupled receptor (17.Juppner H. Abou-Samra A.B. Freeman M. Kong X.F. Schipani E. Richards J. Kolakowski Jr., L.F. Hock J. Potts Jr., J.T. Kronenberg H.M. Segre G.V. Science. 1991; 254: 1024-1026Crossref PubMed Scopus (1150) Google Scholar). Binding is followed by activation of adenylyl cyclase, an increase in cAMP level, and activation of cAMP-dependent protein kinase A (PKA). At the same time, phospholipase C (PLC) may also be activated, leading to the release of Ca2+ and induction of a protein kinase C (PKC)-associated pathway (18.Schwartz Z. Semba S. Graves D. Dean D.D. Sylvia V.L. Boyan B.D. Bone. 1997; 21: 249-259Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar, 19.Yang R. Gerstenfeld L.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 29839-29846Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). Mutations causing inactivation or constitutive activation of PTH receptors are associated with profound genetic defects in humans (20.Jobert A.S. Zhang P. Couvineau A. Bonaventure J. Roume J. Le Merrer M. Silve C. J. Clin. Invest. 1998; 102: 34-40Crossref PubMed Scopus (265) Google Scholar, 21.Schipani E. Langman C.B. Parfitt A.M. Jensen G.S. Kikuchi S. Kooh S.W. Cole W.G. Juppner H. N. Engl. J. Med. 1996; 335: 708-714Crossref PubMed Scopus (254) Google Scholar). Our previous studies have shown that PTH activates osteocalcin transcription, at least in part, via the cAMP-dependent PKA pathway (6.Yu X.-P. Chandrasekhar S. Endocrinology. 1997; 138: 3085-3092Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). These results are consistent with the presence of cAMP regulatory sequences within the osteocalcin gene promoter (6.Yu X.-P. Chandrasekhar S. Endocrinology. 1997; 138: 3085-3092Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). However, since this promoter contains additional potential response elements, its activation by PTH may involve additional signal transduction pathways. In this report, we present evidence that activation of PTH-mediated osteocalcin transcription involves both PKA- and PKC-dependent pathways. Rat PTH-(1–38); human PTH-(1–31), PTH-(1–34), PTH-(13–34), PTH-(53–84), and PTH-(1–84); bovine PTH-(3–34) and PTH-(7–34); and human PTH-related protein-(1–34) were obtained from Bachem (Terrance, CA). Stocks of the polypeptides were prepared in a PTH diluent (1 mm HCl, 0.15 mNaCl containing 1 mg of bovine serum albumin/ml). Except where specified, the rat PTH-(1–38) peptide was used in the experiments described below. Calphostin C, okadaic acid, forskolin (FSK), 1,9-dideoxy-FSK, dibutyryl-3′,5′-cAMP, phorbol 12-myristoyl 13-acetate (PMA), and H-89 were obtained from Alexis Corp. (San Diego, CA). The compounds were dissolved in Me2SO and diluted as needed with PTH diluent. Human insulin-like growth factor I (IGF-I) and human basic fibroblast growth factor (FGF) were from Sigma; both were prepared in PTH diluent. Media components, Geneticin (G418), and fetal bovine serum (FBS) used for cell cultivation were purchased from Life Technologies, Inc. Plasmids containing the rat or human osteocalcin gene promoter fragments were constructed using the promoterless pGL-2 basic luciferase gene reporter vector (Promega Corp., Madison, WI) as a backbone (6.Yu X.-P. Chandrasekhar S. Endocrinology. 1997; 138: 3085-3092Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). The rat and the human promoter sequences (1.154 and 0.844 kilobase pairs, respectively) were generated by PCR on the basis of published information (rat promoter, GenBankTM accession number M23637, nucleotides 1–1154; human promoter, M34013, nucleotides 1–844). The PCR fragments were recovered in pCR®II TA cloning vector (Invitrogen Corp., Carlsbad, CA), excised with KpnI and XhoI, and subcloned into pGL-2 digested with KpnI and XhoI. These plasmids (pRaOCN-luc and pHuOCN-luc) were used to establish stable luciferase-expressing clones in ROS17/2.8 and SaOS-2 cell lines, respectively. The osteocalcin probe was prepared by 32P labeling of a full-length osteocalcin DNA obtained by PCR from a rat cDNA library generated previously in this laboratory. The RNA for Northern analysis was extracted from ∼80% confluent ROS17/2.8 cells using Ultraspec-IITM solution from Biotecx Laboratories (Houston, TX) and enriched for the poly(A)+-containing fraction by purification on an Oligotex column (Qiagen, Valencia, CA). Manufacturers' instructions were followed in each case. The RNAs were fractionated on a 1% agarose-formaldehyde gel, transferred to a nylon membrane, and probed with the osteocalcin-specific probe. A 465-base pair fragment of ubiquitin carrier protein DNA produced from a rat cDNA library by PCR was used to normalize the signal. For the RT-PCR experiments, the ROS17/2.8 cells were grown to confluence, starved in serum-free medium containing 0.1% bovine serum albumin, and treated with various forms of PTH. The RNAs were extracted using Ultraspec-IITM, and 5 μg of total RNA were used for first strand cDNA synthesis (SuperScriptTM; Life Technologies, Inc.). The product (1–2 μl) was amplified by 10 cycles of PCR using primers specific for osteocalcin and glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH). Aliquots of PCRs were fractionated on a 1% agarose gel, transferred to a nylon membrane, and probed with radiolabeled osteocalcin and GAPDH DNA. Quantitation was carried out with a PhosphorImager (Molecular Dynamics, Inc., Sunnyvale, CA). A slightly modified procedure of van Leeuwen et al. (22.van Leeuwen J.P.T.M. Birkenhager J.C. van dem Bemd G.C.M. Pols H.A.P. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1996; 1312: 55-62Crossref Scopus (27) Google Scholar) was used to follow osteocalcin production. ROS17/2.8 cells were seeded in six-well culture dishes (4.5 × 105 cells/well) in Ham's F-12 medium containing 10% FBS (Hyclone, Logan, UT) and 2 mm glutamine and incubated at 37 °C under a 5% CO2, 95% air atmosphere. After 24 h, the medium was aspirated and replaced with the F-12 medium containing 2% serum. PTH-(1–38) was added at a concentration of 10−7 to 10−9m, and the incubation continued for an additional 72-h period, unless otherwise indicated. The control well received vehicle diluent. Osteocalcin concentrations in the culture supernatants were determined using a rat osteocalcin radioimmunoassay kit (Biomedical Technologies, Stoughton, MA). Rat (ROS17/2.8) and human (SaOS-2) osteoblast-like cell lines were used to generate stable transfectants. Initially, cells were transiently transfected with either the OCN reporter vectors (see below) or the promoterless pGL-2 vector control, which established that FSK or PTH-(1–38) was effective in eliciting OCN-luciferase activation. The cells were maintained in Ham's F-12 or Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium/F-12 medium (3:1), respectively, supplemented with 2 mm glutamine and 10% FBS. The cells were grown to ∼90% confluence, trypsinized, and inoculated into T25 flasks at a density of 5 × 105 cells/flask. After 24 h, the attached cells were transfected with a mixture (1:1 molar ratio) of the reporter vector (pRaOCN-luc or pHuOCN-luc) and pcDNA3.1 plasmid (Invitrogen), carrying a neomycin resistance gene (a total of 3 μg of DNA). Transfections utilizing the LipofectAMINE reagent (Life Technologies, Inc.) were performed according to the manufacturer's instructions. Geneticin-resistant clones capable of growth in the presence of the antibiotic (1 mg/ml) were isolated over a period of 3–4 weeks, expanded, and assayed for luciferase activity as described below. SaOS-2 cells were transfected with OCN-luc plasmids by the calcium phosphate method as described previously (6.Yu X.-P. Chandrasekhar S. Endocrinology. 1997; 138: 3085-3092Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). Selected clones were maintained in T150 flasks in appropriate medium containing geneticin (1 mg/ml), grown to 80–90% confluence, harvested, and inoculated into 96-well plates at a density of 5 × 104 cells/well. Each well contained a total volume of 300 μl of medium. The plates were incubated for 24 h at 37 °C under a 5% CO2, 95% air atmosphere, and the cells were synchronized by an additional period of 12–20 h of incubation in 200 μl of the same medium containing 0.1% FBS. Following this starvation/synchronization period, the compounds under study were added to triplicate wells, the PTH diluent serving as the vehicle control. Unless stated otherwise, the length of each treatment was 8 h. After the treatments, the solutions were aspirated, and the cells were lysed for 15 min in 60 μl of the luciferase lysis buffer (Roche Molecular Biochemicals). At this point, the luciferase activity could be measured in lysates, or the plates, protected with sealing film, could be stored at −80 °C for assay at a later time. The assays were performed using the Luciferase Reporter Gene Assay kit from Roche Molecular Biochemicals Corp. Aliquots (20 μl) of cell lysates were pipetted into wells of white opaque microtiter plates (Dynex Technologies, Chantilly, VA) and placed in an automated injection MLX microtiter plate luminometer. The luciferase reaction mix (100 μl) was injected sequentially into the wells. The light signals generated in the reactions were integrated over an interval of 2 s, and the resulting luminescence values were used as a measure of luciferase activity (relative units). Initially, we evaluated the time course of OCN induction in response to PTH treatment. This was evaluated by treating ROS17/2.8 cells with PTH-(1–38) and then evaluating either the OCN mRNA (Fig. 1 A) or OCN secreted into the medium. Northern blot analysis demonstrates that the level of osteocalcin mRNA began to rise within 1 h of PTH administration and continued to increase for at least 24 h (Fig1 A). The mRNA abundance increased over 4-fold in 24 h as compared with the untreated control. The effect of PTH on osteocalcin secretion was also confirmed by determination of protein secreted into the medium at various time intervals as well as in response to various concentrations of PTH-(1–38). As shown in Fig. 1 (B and C), osteocalcin levels increased in a time- and dose-dependent manner, with 72 h of PTH treatment showing the best response to PTH-(1–38). Thus, PTH elevates both steady-state osteocalcin mRNA level and the quantity of osteocalcin protein secreted by the cells. We next examined the effect of truncated PTH peptides on the level of OCN expression (mRNA abundance and protein secretion). ROS17/2.8 cells were treated with various truncated forms of PTH and the relative abundance of OCN mRNA was measured by RT-PCR, using GAPDH mRNA as an internal control. The results (Fig.2 A) demonstrate that only those PTH fragments (PTH-(1–34), -(1–31), -(1–38), and -(1–84)) that are known to elicit cAMP accumulation (23.Chorev M. Rosenblatt M. Bilezikian J.P. Raisz L.G. Rodan G.A. Principles of Bone Biology. Academic Press, Inc., San Diego1996: 305-323Google Scholar) stimulated OCN expression. Other peptides (PTH-(3–34), -(13–34), and -(53–84)) that do not bind to PTH receptor and do not elevate cAMP level were ineffective. These mRNA level changes were further confirmed by quantitating the level of OCN secreted into the medium (Fig.2 B). To determine if PTH exerted its effects at the transcriptional level, we analyzed OCN promoter activity in stable transfectant cell lines generated in ROS17/2.8 and SaOS-2 cells with OCN-luciferase plasmids. Examination of independently and randomly selected geneticin-resistant clones revealed that these clones exhibited a wide variation in both basal luciferase activity and PTH-(1–38) responsiveness (Table I). For subsequent experiments, we chose two rat clones (RG15 and RG24) and two human clones (SG12 and SG40) that consistently maintained both basal and PTH-inducible luciferase expression.Table IOCN-luciferase activity and inducibility in stable transfectant clonesParent cell lines/clonesBasal activityActivity with PTHStimulation5 × 10 −8 m-foldROS17/2.8 RG2122.0 RG43134.3 RG50.1110.0 RG9501903.8 RG1023341.5 RG123328482.6 RG15392857.3 RG23743624.9 RG2412222.0SaOS-2 SG517321.9 SG11362.0 SG121215813.2 SG240.1220.0 SG404153.8The stable transfectants were generated as described under “Experimental Procedures” and were tested for OCN-luciferase expression in the absence or presence of PTH-(1–38). Open table in a new tab The stable transfectants were generated as described under “Experimental Procedures” and were tested for OCN-luciferase expression in the absence or presence of PTH-(1–38). Both ROS17/2.8 and SaOS-2 transfectants exhibited time-dependent induction of reporter gene activity by PTH-(1–38) (Fig. 3), with the highest level of luciferase activity observed at about 8 h (4–30-fold induction, depending on the clone). These results are in agreement with our previous observations on transiently transfected SaOS-2 cells (6.Yu X.-P. Chandrasekhar S. Endocrinology. 1997; 138: 3085-3092Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). The PTH dose response was also examined in the four stable clones (Fig.4). The four cell lines show a similar pattern of activation by the hormone, being half-maximally stimulated at PTH concentrations of 7.5 × 10−9 to 5 × 10−10m and reaching a maximum level at 5 × 10−7 to 5 × 10−5m. The activity in clone RG15 showed no leveling off even at the highest dose (5 × 10−5m) of PTH used in this experiment.Figure 4Effect of various concentrations of PTH -(1–38) on OCN-luc activity. Cells in microtiter dishes were treated with indicated amounts of PTH for 8 h, lysed, and assayed for expression of luciferase activity as described above.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) We next confirmed that in stable cell lines, distinct domains of PTH evoked specific OCN responses (Refs. 6.Yu X.-P. Chandrasekhar S. Endocrinology. 1997; 138: 3085-3092Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar and 23.Chorev M. Rosenblatt M. Bilezikian J.P. Raisz L.G. Rodan G.A. Principles of Bone Biology. Academic Press, Inc., San Diego1996: 305-323Google Scholar; Fig. 2). The PTH analogs PTH-(1–31) and PTH-(1–38), which are known to raise intracellular cAMP concentration and stimulate the PKA pathway (6.Yu X.-P. Chandrasekhar S. Endocrinology. 1997; 138: 3085-3092Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar, 23.Chorev M. Rosenblatt M. Bilezikian J.P. Raisz L.G. Rodan G.A. Principles of Bone Biology. Academic Press, Inc., San Diego1996: 305-323Google Scholar), were also able to stimulate reporter gene activity in the stable transfectant clones (Fig.5). A truncated PTH-related protein, PTHrP-(1–34), was nearly as active as PTH-(1–38). In contrast, PTH-(3–34) and PTH-(7–34), the analogues incapable of elevating intracellular cAMP level (23.Chorev M. Rosenblatt M. Bilezikian J.P. Raisz L.G. Rodan G.A. Principles of Bone Biology. Academic Press, Inc., San Diego1996: 305-323Google Scholar) were unable, at the concentration used, to activate OCN-luc. These results are consistent with the known involvement of PKA in PTH-induced osteocalcin expression. Both rat- and human osteosarcoma-derived stable clones responded similarly in this test. To further evaluate the involvement of the PKA pathway in PTH-induced OCN-luc expression in stably transfected cells, we examined the effect of various concentrations of FSK, a well known activator of adenylyl cyclase (6.Yu X.-P. Chandrasekhar S. Endocrinology. 1997; 138: 3085-3092Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar, 24.Towler D.A. Rodan G.A. Endocrinology. 1995; 136: 1089-1096Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar), and dibutyryl cAMP. As shown in Fig. 6 A, SaOS-2 cells exposed to dibutyryl cAMP (10−6 to 10−3m), or FSK (10−7 to 10−5m), demonstrated a concentration-dependent increase in OCN-luc expression. We also evaluated whether treatment with these agents resulted in enhanced OCN protein secretion. The results (Fig. 6 B) show that PTH, FSK, and cAMP treatment of ROS 17/2.8 cells resulted in a 5–7-fold stimulation of OCN secretion during the 72-h treatment period. We also evaluated OCN-luc expression in the presence of H-89, a selective inhibitor of the PKA pathway. The results (Fig. 7) of a transient transfection experiment using a single FSK concentration (10−5m) and various concentrations of H-89 (0.1–10 μm) indicate a concentration-dependent inhibition of FSK-stimulated OCN-luc expression by H-89. Collectively, these results further confirm that activation of the PKA pathway leads to activation of OCN expression.Figure 7Effect of various doses of H-89 on FSK-stimulated OCN promoter activity. SaOS-2 cells were transiently transfected with OCN-luc promoter, as described (6.Yu X.-P. Chandrasekhar S. Endocrinology. 1997; 138: 3085-3092Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar), using the calcium phosphate precipitation method, and after 24 h, they were further treated with FSK (10−5m) with the indicated concentrations of H-89. The enzyme activity was determined and normalized to cellular protein, and it is expressed as -fold increase versus control.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Because the PTH receptor can signal through phospholipase C and thus, indirectly, through the PKC pathway (18.Schwartz Z. Semba S. Graves D. Dean D.D. Sylvia V.L. Boyan B.D. Bone. 1997; 21: 249-259Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar, 19.Yang R. Gerstenfeld L.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 29839-29846Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar), we asked whether activators of PKC could stimulate OCN transcription. As shown in Fig. 8, when SG12 cells were treated with PMA, the expression of OCN-luc was significantly stimulated (28-fold increase over control level). A combination of PTH and PMA or of FSK and PMA was at least additive, if not synergistic (136- and 166-fold increase, respectively, as compared with PTH alone (63-fold) and FSK alone (45-fold)). Very similar results were obtained with SaOS-2 cells transiently transfected with OCN-luc plasmid (not shown). To determine whether PTH and PMA can act through independent pathways to activate osteocalcin transcription, we asked if cells pretreated with one activator are able to respond to a subsequent challenge with the same or the other agent. SG12 cells were incubated with either PTH or PMA for 12 h and then challenged with either PMA or PTH for additional 8 h. For comparison, the standard 8-h treatment and continuous 20-h exposure were also evaluated. The results (Fig.9) show that cells exposed to PTH or PMA remained responsive to subsequent challenge with PMA or PTH, respectively, although the amplitude of response was different. While the long term exposure to PMA significantly diminished response to either agent, the desensitization or down-regulation of the PKC-dependent pathway reduced but, importantly, did not abrogate the PTH-dependent signaling. This indicates that desensitization of one pathway still allows the other pathway to mediate OCN transcription. To obtain further confirmation of the involvement of protein kinases in PTH signaling, we have analyzed the SG12 clone responses to a selective protein kinase C inhibitor, calphostin C (25.Kobayashi E. Nakano H. Morimoto M. Tamaoki T. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1989; 159: 548-553Crossref PubMed Scopus (1072) Google Scholar). As shown in Fig. 10 A, calphostin C inhibited the PTH-inducible OCN-luc expression in a dose-dependent fashion. The compound was also effective in abolishing PMA-stimulated OCN-luc expression, indicating a major role for the PKC pathway in regulating osteocalcin transcription. The known PKA inhibitor, H-89 (26.Chijiwa T. Mishima A. Hagiwara M. Sano M. Hayashi K. Inoue T. Naito K. Toshioka T. Hidaka H. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 5267-5272Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), which inhibited the PTH-induced expression (6.Yu X.-P. Chandrasekhar S. Endocrinology. 1997; 138: 3085-3092Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar), had no effect on PMA-induced OCN-luc expression (Fig.10 B). In order to further define whether or not both the PKA and PKC pathways are activated independently, we evaluated the effects of H-89 or calphostin C on OCN mRNA levels after stimulation with either PTH or cAMP. The results (Fig. 11) show that a 24-h PTH treatment (lane 2) resulted in a 4.9-fold stimulation of OCN mRNA levels, in comparison with control (lane 1). Treatments with PTH plus H-89 (lane 3) or PTH plus calphostin C (lane 4) resulted in at least a partial reduction in OCN mRNA levels (2.9- and 2.4-fold, respectively, in comparison with control). A treatment with cAMP resulted in a 3.5-fold increase in OCN mRNA level (lane 5), while H-89 co-treatment with cAMP reduced the OCN mRNA levels to 1.6-fold (lane 6), which was comparable with the reduction obtained with H-89 alone (lane 8). More importantly, a calphostin C co-treatment with cAMP was ineffective (lane 7). These results establish that (a) PTH stimulation of OCN transcription is mediated by either PKA or"

Serotonin-1A receptors have been shown to be suppressed by corticosteroid hormones in a variety of animal studies. This effect may play a central role in the pathophysiology of depression. However, little is known about the molecular mechanism underlying this suppressive effect of corticosteroids. Here, we show by functional analysis of the promoter region of the rat serotonin-1A receptor gene that two NF-κB elements in the promoter contribute to induced transcription of the rat serotonin-1A receptor gene. Furthermore, we show that corticosteroids repress this NF-κB-mediated induction of transcription. Remarkably, we observed that only the glucocorticoid receptor and not the mineralocorticoid receptor was able to mediate this repressive effect of corticosteroids. We argue that negative cross-talk between the glucocorticoid receptor and NF-κB may provide a basis for the molecular mechanism underlying the negative action of corticosteroids on serotonin signaling in the brain.

Curr. Opin. Neurobiol. 1997; 7: 243-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (269) Google Scholar). Extensive evidence also supports the involvement of serotonin function in neuropsychiatric disorders, such as depression and anxiety (2.Murphy D.L.

The complex physiological actions of serotonin are mediated by a family of related receptors of which particular attention has focused on the 5-HT1A receptor (6.Julius D. Annu. Rev.

In addition to dysregulation of the serotonin system, abnormalities of hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis function also have been described to be involved in neuropsychiatric disorders. The hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis regulates the synthesis and secretion of the adrenal corticosteroids, which influence numerous processes in the central nervous system modulating mood, behavior, and neuroendocrine function (11.Stokes P.E. Sikes C.R. Meltzer H.Y. Psychopharmacology: The Third Generation of Progress. Raven, New York1987: 589-607Google Scholar, 12.de Kloet E.R. Front.

Corticosteroids exert their action by binding to two types of intracellular corticosteroid receptors, the mineralocorticoid receptor (MR) and the glucocorticoid receptor (GR) (14.Reul J.M.H.M. de Kloet E.R. Endocrinology. 1985; 117: 2505-2511Crossref PubMed Scopus (2215) Google Scholar, 15.Evans R.M. Arriza J.L. Neuron. 1989; 2: 1105-1112Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (182) Google Scholar). Upon hormone binding, the receptor translocates to the nucleus and can activate transcription by binding to specific glucocorticoid response elements (GREs) in the regulatory region of target genes. Because of the high degree of homology in the DNA binding domain, MR and GR can interact with the same target DNA sequence (16.Arriza J.L. Weinberger C. Cerelli G. Glaser T.M. Handelin B.L. Housman D.E. Evans R.M. Science. 1987; 237: 268-275Crossref PubMed Scopus (1643) Google Scholar). Of the two receptors, MR exhibits the highest affinity for corticosteroids, whereas GR mediates a higher stimulation of transcription (17.Rupprecht R. Ariza J.L. Spengler D. Reul J.M.H.M. Evans R.M. Holsboer F. Damm K. Mol. Endocrinol. 1993; 7: 597-603Crossref PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar). Besides activation of transcription, GR has been described to repress transcription of genes either via negative GREs or via protein-protein interactions with transcription factors such as AP-1 and NF-κB (18.Cato A.C.B. Wade E. Bioessays. 1996; 18: 317-378Crossref PubMed Scopus (297) Google Scholar, 19.Van der Burg B. Okret S. Liden J. Wissink S. van der Saag P.T. Gustafsson J.-Å. Trends Endocrinol.

Med. 1998; 76: 480-489Crossref PubMed Scopus (318) Google Scholar). Both autoradiographic and immunohistochemical studies indicate that the hippocampus contains particularly high concentrations of both MR and GR compared with other brain regions (21.Sarrieau A. Vial M. Philibert D. Rostene W. Eur. J. Pharmacol. 1984; 98: 151-152Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar, 22.Fuxe K. Wikstrom A.C. Okret S. Agnati L.F. Harfstrand A., Yu, Z.Y. Granholm L. Zoli M. Vale W. Gustafsson J.-Å. Endocrinology. 1985; 117: 1803-1812Crossref PubMed Scopus (492) Google Scholar). Several studies with adrenalectomized rats have shown a suppressive effect of exogenous corticosteroids on 5-HT1A receptor mRNA expression in the hippocampus (23.Chalmers D.T. Kwak S.P. Mansour A. Akil H. Watson S.J. J. Neurosc. 1993; 13: 914-923Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 24.Meijer O.C. de Kloet E.R. Eur. J. Parmacol. 1994; 266: 255-261Crossref PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar). However, little is known about the molecular mechanism underlying this effect. To investigate the mechanism by which corticosteroids repress rat 5-HT1A receptor expression, we functionally analyzed the promoter region of the rat 5-HT1A receptor gene in COS-1 cells and P19 embryonal carcinoma (EC) cells. Evidence is provided that two NF-κB elements in the rat 5-HT1A receptor promoter contribute to induced transcription of the rat 5-HT1A receptor gene. Furthermore, corticosteroids are shown to repress this NF-κB-mediated induction of transcription. Remarkably, we observed that only GR and not MR is able to mediate this repressive effect of corticosteroids. Our results suggest that repression of NF-κB activity by GR may provide a mechanism underlying the negative action of corticosteroids on 5-HT1A receptor activity. Dexamethasone, d-aldosterone, and hydrocortisone were obtained from Sigma. Monkey COS-1 cells were obtained from American Type Culture Collection (Manassas, VA). Mouse EC cells, P19S1801A1 were cultured as described before (25.Mummery C.L. van den Brink C.E. de Laat S.W. Dev. Biol. 1987; 121: 10-19Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). Both cell lines were cultured in a 1:1 mixture of DMEM and Ham's F-12 medium (Life Technologies, Inc.), buffered with bicarbonate, and supplemented with 7.5% FCS. CV1-b cells were grown in DMEM (Life Technologies, Inc.), buffered with bicarbonate, and supplemented with 5% FCS. Dextran-coated charcoal-FCS was prepared by treatment of FCS with dextran-coated charcoal to remove steroids, as described previously (26.Van der Burg B. Rutteman G.R. Blankenstijn M.A. de Laat S.W. Van Zoelen E.J.J. J. Cell. Physiol. 1988; 123: 101-108Crossref Scopus (224) Google Scholar). The construct −1588luc containing 1588 base pairs of the rat 5-HT1A receptor 5′-flanking region was described previously (38.Meijer, O. C., Williamson, A., Dallman, M. F., and Pearce, D. (1999) J. Neuroendocrinol., in pressGoogle Scholar). This 1588-base pairs XbaI/BglII was cloned into pGL3 digested with NheI/BglII. Subsequent deletion constructs were obtained using restriction digestions at specific sites in the promoter; −1388luc was created by digestion of −1588luc with HpaI/BglII and ligation into pGL3 digested with SmaI/BglII; −901luc was created by partial digestion of −1588luc with StyI, filling-in and ligation into pGL3 digested with SmaI, redigestion withHindIII, and religation; −208luc was created by digestion of −1588luc with KpnI/SacII, filling-in, and religation; −122luc was created by digestion of −1588luc withBamHI/BglII and ligation into pGL3 digested withBglII; −81luc was created by digestion of −1588luc withStyI, filling-in, and digestion with BglII and ligation into pGL3 digested with SmaI/BglII; and −1588Δ901–81luc was created by partial digestion of −1588luc with StyI and religation. −901 365Mluc and −901 64Mluc were constructed by introducing point mutations into the original promoter constructs by site-directed mutagenesis using the oligonucleotides 5′-gagccgaattctacagactaa-3′ and 5′-aactgcaaggagatctacatcgcccctcg-3′, respectively. −901 365/64Mluc was created by digestion of −901 64Mluc with SacII/HindIII and ligation into −901 365Mluc digested with SacII/HindIII. The reporter plasmid 2xGREtkluc has been described elsewhere (28.Schüle R. Muller M. Kaltschmidt C. Renkawitz R. Science. 1988; 242: 1418-1421Crossref PubMed Scopus (387) Google Scholar). The CMV4 expression vectors containing full-length cDNAs encoding human p65 (RelA), p50 (NF-κB1), and GR have been described before (29.Caldenhoven E. Liden J. Wissink S. Van de Stolpe A. Raaijmakers J. Okret S. Gustafsson J.-Å. Van der Saag P.T. Mol. Endocrinol. 1995; 9: 401-412Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The CMV4 expression vector containing full-length cDNA encoding human MR was made by digesting pRShMR, a kind gift from Dr. Evans (San Diego CA), with AvaI, filling-in, digesting with AccI, ligated into AccI/EcoRV-digested pBluescript SK−. Additionally, SK−hMR was digested withKpnI/SmaI, and the fragment was ligated into CMV4 digested with KpnI/SmaI. For transient transfections, COS-1 cells and P19 cells were cultured in 24-well plates in DMEM and Ham's F-12 medium. DMEM and Ham's F-12 medium supplemented with 5% dextran-coated charcoal-FCS for COS-1 cells and 7.5% dextran-coated charcoal-FCS for P19 cells was used when MR function was studied. Cells were transfected using calcium-phosphate coprecipitation with 0.4 μg of luciferase reporter, 0.6 μg of PDMlacZ, and 0.2 μg of the indicated expression plasmids. pBluescript SK− was added to obtain a total amount of 1.8 μg of DNA/well. After 16 h, the medium was refreshed, and, when indicated, hormone was added. Cells were harvested 24 h later and assayed for luciferase activity using the Luclite luciferase reporter gene assay kit (Packard Instruments, Meriden, CT) according to the manufacturer's protocol and the Topcount liquid scintillation counter (Packard Instruments, CT). Values were corrected for transfection efficiency by measuring β-galactosidase activity (30.Pfahl M. Tzukerman M. Zhang X.-K. Lehman J.M. Hermann T. Wills K.N. Graupner G. Methods Enzymol. 1990; 189: 256-270Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). For primer extension, CV1-b cells were cultured in 6-well plates in DMEM and transiently transfected with 1 μg of −1588CAT reporter in combination with 100 ng of empty expression vector or 100 ng of expression vector encoding p65. The total amount of DNA was adjusted to 2–3 μg with pBluescript SK−. Total RNA was isolated using RNeasy (Qiagen). 36-mers were end-labeled with [γ-32P]ATP using T4 kinase for 30 min at 37 °C. Labeled primers were ethanol-precipitated three times and resuspended in 0.3 m NaAc. 5 × 104cpm of primer was annealed overnight to 8 μg of RNA for unstimulated cells and 4 μg of RNA for p65 stimulated cells in S1 hybridization buffer (80% deionized formamide, 40 mm PIPES, 400 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA). cDNA was generated from the RNA using 20 units of Avian myeloblastosis virus reverse transcriptase at 42 °C for 90 min. RNA template was digested with RNase A, and the resulting products were precipitated and run on a 14% denaturing polyacrylamide gel at 300 V, alongside an end-labeled DNA ladder. Subsequently, the gel was dried and autoradiographed. COS-1 cells were grown in 10-cm dishes and transfected as described above with 20 μg of expression plasmid and 10 μg of both plasmids when combinations were used. Whole cell extracts were prepared in Dignam C (20 mmHepes, pH 7.9, 25% glycerol, 420 mm NaCl, 1.5 mm MgCl2, 0.2 mm EDTA, 0.5 mm dithiothreitol, 0.5 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1 μg/ml leupeptin, 1 μg/ml aprotinin) and incubated for 30 min at 4 °C, and membranes were pelleted. Protein concentration of the supernatant was determined by the Bio-Rad protein assay according to the manufacturer's protocol. Double-stranded oligonucleotides containing the κB sites from the HIV long terminal repeat (5′-agcttcagaggggactttccgagagg-3′), the intercellular adhesion molecule-1 promoter (5′-agcttcttggaaattccggagc-3′), the 5HT1AR promoter (−365, 5′-agcttagtcgggagaatccggctc-3′; −65, 5′-agcttgcgagggagatccccttgc-3′) and the mutated κB sites from the 5HT1AR promoter (−365M, 5′-agcttagtctgtagaattcggctc-3′; −65, 5′-agcttgcgatgtagatctccttgc-3′) were labeled with [32P]dCTP using the Klenow fragment of DNA polymerase I. Whole cell extracts (5 μg/assay) were incubated with 15,000 cpm of probe (0.1–0.5 ng) and 2 μg of poly(dI-dC) for 30 min at room temperature in a total reaction mixture of 20 μl containing 20 mm Hepes, pH 7.9, 100 mm KCl, 0.2 mm EDTA, 20% glycerol, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 1 μg/μl bovine serum albumin. Samples were loaded on a 5% polyacrylamide (29:1) gel containing 0.25 × Tris borate, EDTA, pH 8.0, as running buffer, and the gel was run at room temperature at 150 V for 2–2.5 h. After electrophoresis, gels were dried and autoradiographed for 1 day at −80 °C. Although previous studies have shown that addition of corticosteroids to adrenalectomized rats resulted in suppression of 5-HT1A receptor mRNA expression in the hippocampus (23.Chalmers D.T. Kwak S.P. Mansour A. Akil H. Watson S.J. J. Neurosc. 1993; 13: 914-923Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 24.Meijer O.C. de Kloet E.R. Eur. J. Parmacol. 1994; 266: 255-261Crossref PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar), the mechanism underlying this effect remained largely unknown. To elucidate the molecular mechanism by which corticosteroids repress 5-HT1A receptor expression, we functionally analyzed the promoter region of the rat 5-HT1A receptor gene. Sequence analysis of the 1.6-kb promoter did not reveal any GREs. However, sequence analysis did reveal potential response elements for other known transcription factors, including two potential NF-κB elements, located at −365 and −64 in the promoter. Activation of NF-κB in the brain, in response to a variety of stimuli, has been reported (31.O'Neill L.A.J. Kaltschmidt C. Trends Neurosci. 1997; 20: 252-258Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (915) Google Scholar), and we examined whether NF-κB transcription factors were able to influence the transcriptional activity of the 5-HT1A receptor promoter. To investigate the effect of NF-κB, we transiently transfected COS-1 cells and P19 EC cells with several reporter constructs, containing a variety of 5-HT1A promoter deletions (Fig.1 A), in combination with expression vectors encoding the p50 and p65 subunits of NF-κB. As shown in Fig. 1 (B and C), NF-κB was clearly capable of inducing luciferase activity of the −1588 promoter construct in both cell lines. Furthermore, deletion of the region between −122 and −81 resulted in complete abolishment of the NF-κB effect (−81 luc and −1588Δ901–81luc). Deletion of the distal region of the promoter from −1588 to −122 resulted in promoter fragments, which possessed stronger NF-κB-induced activity when transfected into COS-1 cells (Fig. 1 B). However, these proximal promoter fragments showed less induction by NF-κB when transfected into P19 EC cells (Fig. 1 C). This result suggests that the upstream region contains cis-acting DNA sequences that specifically repress transcription depending on the cell line used. The 5-HT1A receptor promoter is a TATA-less promoter, and multiple transcription initiation sites have been found in the mouse and human 5-HT1A receptor promoter (32.Parks C.L. Shenk T. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 4417-4430Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (201) Google Scholar). To determine transcription initiation sites in the rat promoter and to investigate whether increased reporter activity actually reflects increased 5-HT1A receptor promoter-directed transcription, primer extension analysis was carried out. A primer directed at the chloramphenicol acetyltransferase coding sequence, just downstream of the 5-HT1A receptor 5′-flanking region, was used with mRNA from unstimulated CV1-b cells or mRNA from CV1-b cells stimulated with expression vector encoding p65. In the unstimulated condition, two bands of equal intensity were found representing major transcription initiation sites around position −90 and −105 (Fig. 2, lane 1). After stimulation with p65, the lower band (−90) significantly increased in intensity suggesting recruitment of the transcription machinery specifically at this site (Fig. 2, lane 2). This site is located just upstream of the nearby NF-κB binding site at position −64. Longer exposure of the film revealed multiple minor bands (not shown). To further examine the importance of the NF-κB elements in the regulation of the 5-HT1A receptor promoter, we specifically mutated both NF-κB elements in the promoter. To investigate the effect, we transfected COS-1 cells and P19 EC cells with promoter constructs, containing either one or two mutated NF-κB elements (Fig.3 A) in combination with expression vectors encoding the p50 and p65 subunits of NF-κB. Mutation of either the distal NF-κB element located at −365 (−901 365Mluc) or the proximal NF-κB element located at −64 (−901 64Mluc) resulted in a 50% decrease in NF-κB-induced promoter activity in both cell lines (Fig. 3, B and C). Furthermore, mutation of both NF-κB elements (−901 365/64Mluc) completely abolished the effect of NF-κB on the 5-HT1A receptor promoter. Taken together, the results indicate that, although there are some cell type-specific differences in promoter regulation, NF-κB is able to induce the transcriptional activity of the 5-HT1A receptor promoter via two NF-κB elements in both COS-1 cells and P19 EC cells. To examine in more detail functional binding of NF-κB subunits to the kB elements in the 5-HT1A receptor promoter, electrophoretic mobility shift assays (EMSA) were performed using whole cell extracts of COS-1 cells overexpressing specific NF-κB subunits. As shown in Fig. 4 A, both NF-κB elements in the 5-HT1A receptor promoter were able to bind specific NF-κB complexes. The −365 κB element showed efficient binding of p50 homodimers (I), whereas only weak binding of p65 homodimers (III) could be observed. In addition, efficient binding of p50/p65 heterodimers (II), seen as an additional complex with intermediate mobility, could also be observed. In contrast, the −64 κB element showed only efficient binding of p50 homodimers (I), whereas weak binding of p50/p65 heterodimers (II) could be observed when cell extract containing p65 was used. This specific p50/p65 heterodimer is probably formed with endogenous p50 from COS-1 cells. No binding of p65 homodimers could be observed with this −64 κB element. Both mutated κB elements (−365M and −64M) as used earlier in the promoter studies were unable to bind any p50- or p65-containing complex (results not shown). As a control for binding and mobility of the specific κB complexes, EMSA was also performed with probes containing κB elements from the HIV long terminal repeat and the intercellular adhesion molecule-1 promoter (Fig. 4 B). As described before (33.Wissink S. Van de Stolpe A. Caldenhoven E. Koenderman L. Van der Saag P.T. Immunobiol. 1997; 198: 50-64Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar), the κB element in the HIV long terminal repeat preferentially bound p50 homodimers (I) and p50/p65 heterodimers (II) and more weakly p65 homodimers (III), whereas the κB element in the intercellular adhesion molecule-1 promoter preferentially bound p65 homodimers (III) and more weakly p50 homodimers (I) and p50/p65 heterodimers (II). Together these data indicate that specific NF-κB complexes are able to bind to the κB elements in the 5-HT1A receptor promoter. Previous studies have shown that GR is able to repress transcription of target genes via protein-protein interactions with other transcription factors, including NF-κB. To examine the effect of corticosteroids on NF-κB-induced activity of the 5-HT1A receptor promoter, we transfected COS-1 cells and P19 EC cells with three different reporter constructs, containing 5-HT1A promoter deletions (−1588 luc, −901 luc, and −208 luc; see Fig.1 A) in combination with expression vectors encoding the p50 and p65 subunits of NF-κB and GR. As shown in Fig.5 A, the NF-κB-induced activity of all three promoter constructs could be repressed by GR after treatment of COS-1 cells with dexamethasone. Comparison of the promoter constructs showed that the repression varied from 40% when −1588 luc and −901 luc were used to 65% when −208 luc was used. In P19 EC cells (Fig. 5 B), the NF-κB-induced activity of both −1588 luc and −901 luc was also repressed hormone-dependently by GR to approximately 55%, whereas the activity of the −208 luc construct was not affected by GR. This was due to a low level of NF-κB-induced activity of this construct in P19 EC cells as compared with COS-1 cells (see Fig. 1, B andC). Because corticosteroids are known to exert their action not only via GR but also via MR, we examined whether MR was also able to mediate this repressive effect of corticosteroids. We transfected COS-1 cells and P19 EC cells with the 5-HT1A promoter construct in combination with expression vectors encoding the p50 and p65 subunits of NF-κB and GR or MR. Although treatment of the cells with dexamethasone or hydrocortisone in the case of GR resulted in repression of NF-κB-induced promoter activity, treatment of the cells with aldosterone or hydrocortisone in the case of MR had no effect on the promoter activity in both cell lines (Fig.6, A and B). In a control experiment, MR was able to activate transcription from a GRE-containing reporter construct after treatment of the cells with ligand, although the transcriptional activity of MR was found to be less strong than that of GR (results not shown), a phenomenon that has been described earlier (17.Rupprecht R. Ariza J.L. Spengler D. Reul J.M.H.M. Evans R.M. Holsboer F. Damm K. Mol. Endocrinol. 1993; 7: 597-603Crossref PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar). Taken together, our results indicate that repression of NF-κB activity by GR could be the mechanism by which corticosteroids suppress rat 5-HT1A receptor expression in the brain. To unravel the mechanism underlying the negative action of corticosteroids on serotonin signaling, we investigated the promoter region of the rat 5-HT1A receptor gene. Previous studies in rats showed that the 5-HT1A receptor gene is negatively regulated by corticosteroids (23.Chalmers D.T. Kwak S.P. Mansour A. Akil H. Watson S.J. J. Neurosc. 1993; 13: 914-923Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 24.Meijer O.C. de Kloet E.R. Eur. J. Parmacol. 1994; 266: 255-261Crossref PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar). Because the gene does not contain obvious negative GREs, this negative regulation may be the result of protein-protein interactions of the corticosteroid receptors with other transcription factors. This negative action of GR via direct protein-protein interaction with other transcription factors, such as NF-κB and AP-1, is thought to play a pivotal role in the anti-inflammatory action of glucocorticoids (18.Cato A.C.B. Wade E. Bioessays. 1996; 18: 317-378Crossref PubMed Scopus (297) Google Scholar, 19.Van der Burg B. Okret S. Liden J. Wissink S. van der Saag P.T. Gustafsson J.-Å. Trends Endocrinol. Metabol. 1997; 8: 152-157Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar, 20.Göttlicher M. Heck S. Herrlich P. J. Mol. Med. 1998; 76: 480-489Crossref PubMed Scopus (318) Google Scholar). In the present study, we show that NF-κB binding sites in the rat 5-HT1A receptor promoter region contribute to induced transcription of the gene, whereas corticosteroids can repress this NF-κB-mediated induction of transcription via GR. Mutation analysis showed the importance of two NF-κB binding sites in activation of the 5-HT1A receptor promoter. Mutation of either one of the two elements resulted in a 50% decrease in NF-κB-induced promoter activity. These data indicate that there is no synergism between the two NF-κB elements but just an additive effect. The fact that the κB element at −64 is conserved between mouse and rat and the element at −365 is conserved between mouse, rat, and human (32.Parks C.L. Shenk T. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 4417-4430Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (201) Google Scholar) already suggests the importance of these elements in the regulation of the 5-HT1A receptor gene. Functional binding of NF-κB subunits was determined by EMSA, and it was shown that the −64 κB element preferentially bound p50 dimers, whereas p50/p65 heterodimers preferentially bound to the −365 κB element. These differences in affinity for NF-κB subunits were consistent with binding characteristics as predicted for these sequences, based on binding of NF-κB subunits to artificial κB oligonucleotides (34.Kunsch C. Ruben S.M. Rosen C.A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1992; 12: 4412-4421Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Promoter deletion analysis revealed the presence of several important regulatory regions in the rat 5-HT1A receptor promoter. The region between −122 and −81 was shown to be essential for NF-κB-induced activation of transcription. Although the −81luc construct still contained an NF-κB binding site, transcriptional activity was completely abolished. In both the human and mouse 5′-flanking sequence, RNA 5′ end mapping experiments demonstrated the existence of numerous transcription start sites (32.Parks C.L. Shenk T. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 4417-4430Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (201) Google Scholar). Primer extension analysis of the rat 5-HT1A receptor promoter showed the presence of two major start sites that represent initiation around −90 and −105. Both sites were equally used for basal transcription. Stimulation with p65 specifically induced initiation around position −90. This site is located just upstream of the NF-κB binding site located at −64 and absent from the inactive −81luc reporter construct, suggesting recruitment of the transcription machinery selectively at this site located around −90. Because this arrangement of start sites is conserved between mouse and human, it is also likely to have some functional significance. The presence of several transcription initiation sites may provide a mechanism for differential control of 5-HT1A receptor transcription in different cell types and brain regions. Furthermore, deletion of the distal part of the promoter from −1588 to −122 resulted in promoter constructs that were more active in COS-1 cells and less active in P19 EC cells. This could be due to the presence of cis-acting DNA sequences in the upstream region that repress transcription specifically in COS-1 cells, suggesting that a different complement of transcription factors is present in P19 EC cells as compared with COS-1 cells. In both cell lines, GR was shown to repress NF-κB-induced transcription of the 5-HT1A receptor after addition of hormone. Both the synthetic glucocorticoid, dexamethasone, and a naturally occurring corticosteroid, hydrocortisone, were able to mediate this effect of GR. In contrast, MR, the other corticosteroid receptor, important for activity in the brain, was unable to repress this NF-κB-induced transcription after addition of the mineralocorticoid, aldosterone, or hydrocortisone. In previous studies, similar results have been obtained on repression of AP-1 activity by both receptors. Under conditions in which GR represses AP-1-stimulated transcription, MR was inactive (35.Pearce D. Yamamoto K.R. Science. 1993; 259: 1161-1165Crossref PubMed Scopus (399) Google Scholar,36.Heck S. Kullman M. Gast A. Ponta H. Rahmsdorf H.J. Herrlich P. Cato A.C.B. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 4087-4095Crossref PubMed Scopus (466) Google Scholar). Although both receptors can bind to the same target DNA sequence (GRE), only GR has been found to negatively regulate transcription via protein-protein interactions with other transcription factors. These data suggest that negative cross-talk between GR and NF-κB may provide a basis for the molecular mechanism underlying the negative action of corticosteroids in the brain. Besides the 5-HT1A receptor and the corticosteroid receptors, GR and MR, NF-κB has also been found to be expressed in the brain, particularly in cortex and hippocampus (37.Schmidt-Ullrich R. Memet S. Lilienbaum A. Feuillard J. Raphael M. Israel A. Development. 1996; 122: 2117-2128PubMed Google Scholar). As in the periphery, the target genes for NF-κB in brain also encode proteins involved in inflammation. However, new evidence is accumulating that NF-κB also plays a specific role in the brain in processes such as neuronal plasticity and neurodegeneration (31.O'Neill L.A.J. Kaltschmidt C. Trends Neurosci. 1997; 20: 252-258Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (915) Google Scholar). In addition, it has been shown that expression of the NF-κB target gene, interleukin-1β, is increased during long-term potentiation of synaptic transmission, a process thought to underlie certain forms of learning and memory (27.Schneider H. Pitossi F. Balschun D. Wagner A. Del Rey A. Besedovsky H.O. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 7778-7783Crossref PubMed Scopus (412) Google Scholar). Obviously, the exact role of NF-κB in brain function related to serotonin needs to be further examined. Because removal of circulating corticosteroids by adrenalectomy causes up-regulation of 5-HT1A receptor expression and addition of exogenous corticosteroids suppresses 5-HT1A receptor expression, it seems clear that changes in hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis function can result in dysregulation of the serotonergic system. Controlling hippocampal 5-HT1A receptor expression is one way by which corticosteroids may act to decrease sensitivity to 5-HT in the brain. Based on the role of 5-HT1A receptors in the feedback regulation of the 5-HT system, we hypothesize that 5-HT1A receptors may be down-regulated in depression and therefore display an inadequate ability to convert binding of 5-HT to its receptors into an adequate physiological response.

Human lithostathine, a protein synthesized by the pancreas, inhibits the growth of calcite crystals by inducing a habit modification: the rhombohedral {10 1̄4} usual habit is transformed into a needle-like habit through the {112̄0} crystal form. A similar observation was made with the N-terminal undecapeptide (pE1R11) of lithostathine. We therefore aimed at discovering how peptides inhibit calcium salt crystal growth. We solved the complete x-ray structure of lithostathine, including the flexible N-terminal domain, at 1.3 Å. Docking studies of pE1R11 with the (101̄4) and (11 2̄0) faces through molecular dynamics simulation resulted in three successive steps. First, the undecapeptide progressively unfolded as it approached the calcite surface. Second, mobile lateral chains of amino acids made hydrogen bonds with the calcite surface. Last, electrostatic bonds between calcium ions and peptide bonds stabilized and anchored pE1R11 on the crystal surface. pE1R11-calcite interaction was stronger with the (11 2̄0) face than with the (10 1̄4) face, confirming earlier experimental observations. Energy contributions showed that the peptide backbone governed the binding more than did the lateral chains. The ability of peptides to inhibit crystal growth is therefore essentially based on backbone flexibility. Pancreatic juice is supersaturated with calcium carbonate.

N-(9-fluorenyl)methoxycarbonyl high pressure liquid chromatography pyroglutamic acid Biomineralization has occurred for millions of years (1.Weiner S. Addadi L. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1991; 16: 252-256Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (224) Google Scholar). Half of these biogenic minerals contain calcium (2.Addadi L. Weiner S. Angew. Chem. Int. Ed. Engl. 1992; 31: 153-169Crossref Scopus (792) Google Scholar); for example, the teeth of the sea urchin contain calcium carbonate (CaCO3) in the form of calcite (the most common polymorph existing in nature), and primitive mollusks have aragonite spicules. In humans, biomineralization is observed not only during skeletal formation, but also in biological fluids generally supersaturated with a calcium salt, such as oxalate in urine, phosphate in saliva, or carbonate in pancreatic juice. As a result, calcium salt crystals form spontaneously. While beneficial for tooth or bone mineralization, precipitation of calcium salts can be extremely harmful in fluids because it leads to the formation of stones and to the development of a lithiasis. Various structural motifs emerge at calcite surfaces. Adsorption of additives, i.e. foreign substances, takes place either on growth sites or along the steps that spread over the faces or even onto the flat area of the faces. Since growth proceeds mostly through kinks,i.e. defects, blocking these sites is sufficient to hinder crystal growth. In some cases, adsorption is irreversible. In other cases, however, adsorption of additives is temporary and reversible: the oncoming growing units continuously repulse the additive molecules, which try to incorporate into the crystal lattice, in front of faces in growth. Mineralization must therefore be controlled at the molecular level (3.Addadi L. Berman A. Moradian Oldak J. Weiner S. Connect. Tissue Res. 1989; 21: 127-135Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). This control is ensured mainly by macromolecules, essentially proteins. Since the discovery of dentin (4.Veis A. Perry A. Biochemistry. 1967; 6: 2409-2416Crossref PubMed Scopus (191) Google Scholar), an acidic protein in vertebrate teeth, many other proteins involved in crystal growth control in humans have been described (for a review, see Ref.5.Verdier J.-M. Dussol B. Berland Y. Dagorn J.C. Scanning Microsc. 1993; 7: 1017-1030PubMed Google Scholar). Among these proteins, lithostathine has been well documented. It is a protein of 144 amino acids that is produced by acinar cells of the pancreas and secreted into pancreatic juice. The structure of human lithostathine has been reported at 1.5-Å resolution (6.Bertrand J.A. Pignol D. Bernard J.P. Verdier J.-M. Dagorn J.C. Fontecilla-Camps J.-C. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 2678-2684Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar); no structural information was obtained on the N-terminal domain (residues 1–13), whereas the C-terminal part, which belongs to the C-type lectin superfamily, was fully characterized. Yet, lithostathine is very susceptible to proteolysis. It produces a soluble N-terminal undecapeptide (pE1R11) and a C-terminal form of 133 amino acids that precipitate and form fibrils (7.Cerini C. Peyrot V. Garnier C. Duplan L. Veesler S. Le Caer J.P. Bernard J.P. Bouteille H. Michel R. Vazi A. Dupuy P. Michel B. Berland Y. Verdier J.-M. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 22266-22274Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). The specific association of lithostathine with CaCO3 suggested that it could be involved in the control of crystal growth (8.Scheele G. Gyr K. Singer M. Sarles H. Pancreatitis, Concepts and Classification. Elsevier Science Publishers B. V., Amsterdam1984: 119-125Google Scholar). This suggestion was confirmed by Bernard et al. (9.Bernard J.P. Adrich Z. Montalto G. De Caro A. De Reggi M. Sarles H. Dagorn J.C. Gastroenterology. 1992; 13: 1277-1284Crossref Scopus (67) Google Scholar). However, several other groups published conflicting results depending on how crystal growth measurements in solution had been made (10.Bimmler D. Graf R. Scheele G.A. Frick T.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 3073-3082Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar, 11.De Reggi M. Gharib B. Patard L. Stoven V. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 4967-4971Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). Looking at the calcite crystal morphology in the presence of lithostathine, we previously observed that lithostathine changes the growth of calcite crystal by inducing a habit modification in vitro: the rhombohedral {10 1̄4} 1Crystal planes are denoted by the Miller indicesh, k, i, and l, wherei = −(h + l), which define their orientation relative to the crystal axes.1Crystal planes are denoted by the Miller indicesh, k, i, and l, wherei = −(h + l), which define their orientation relative to the crystal axes. usual habit is first transformed into a subcubic habit and finally into a needle-like habit with the main {11 2̄0} form (12.Geider S. Baronnet A. Cerini C. Nitsche S. Astier J.P. Michel R. Boistelle R. Berland Y. Dagorn J.C. Verdier J.-M. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 26302-26306Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). The synthetic form of pE1R11 also gave the same calcite morphology changes. It required a concentration of only ∼100 times higher than that of the whole protein, in the same range as for CBP1 (0.1–0.5 mm) (13.De Oliveira D.B. Laursen R.A. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1997; 119: 10627-10631Crossref Scopus (231) Google Scholar). The mechanisms of protein-crystal interactions are still poorly understood. Nothing is known about the protein groups involved in the binding to the crystal surface or about the relative energy of these interactions. The purpose of this study was therefore to examine the main characteristics of a good protein inhibitor of calcium salt crystal growth. The purification and crystallization of human lithostathine have been previously described (14.Pignol D. Bertrand J.A. Bernard J.P. Verdier J.-M. Dagorn J.C. Fontecilla-Camps J.-C. Proteins. 1995; 23: 604-606Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar). Crystals belong to the hexagonal P65 space group witha = b = 48 Å and c = 111 Å and contain one molecule of lithostathine/asymmetric unit. Soaking crystals for 24 h in a solution containing 0.5 mm p-chloromercuribenzenesulfonic acid provided the usable heavy atom derivative. A 1.5-Å resolution native data set and a 1.6-Å resolution p-chloromercuribenzenesulfonic acid derivative data set were collected from single crystals on a MarResearch imaging plate system mounted on the wiggler line W32 at the Laboratoire pour l'Utilisation du Rayonnement Electromagnétique synchrotron radiation facility (Orsay, France). The structure was solved by using SIRAS phases and refined to 1.55-Å resolution with X-PLOR (15.Brunger A.T. Kuriyan J. Karplus M. Science. 1987; 235: 458-460Crossref PubMed Scopus (2126) Google Scholar), applying the parameter set of Engh and Huber (16.Engh R.A. Huber R. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. A. 1991; 47: 392-400Crossref Scopus (2543) Google Scholar). The final model includes 138 water molecules and 131 out of the 144 protein residues corresponding to the C-type lectin domain of lithostathine (6.Bertrand J.A. Pignol D. Bernard J.P. Verdier J.-M. Dagorn J.C. Fontecilla-Camps J.-C. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 2678-2684Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). As no interpretable density data for N-terminal residues 1–13 were obtained, a 1.3-Å resolution data set was subsequently collected on a MarResearch imaging plate system at the Hamburg synchrotron radiation facility (Germany). Data were processed with DENZO and SCALEPACK (17.Otwinowski Z. Minor W. Methods Enzymol. 1987; 276: 307-326Crossref Scopus (38526) Google Scholar). The atomic coordinates resulting from the 1.55-Å resolution refinement were used as the starting model. Energy was first minimized with REFMAC (18.Collaborative Computational Project No. 4Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D. 1994; 50: 760-763Crossref PubMed Scopus (19748) Google Scholar) using individual isotropic B-factors. The (2mFo − DFc) and (mFo − DFc) electron density maps, calculated with SIGMAA (18.Collaborative Computational Project No. 4Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D. 1994; 50: 760-763Crossref PubMed Scopus (19748) Google Scholar), clearly showed an extended density around residue 14, into which it was possible to build the N-terminal part of the protein (residues 1–13). Residues 9–11 were built as alanine residues since the density was not interpretable for building the side chains. Finally, a new refinement procedure followed by electron density map calculation was carried out with the model including the complete protein chain. After energy minimization using REFMAC, the R-factor and the free R-factor were only 17.4 and 18.6%, respectively. The N-terminal undecapeptide pyro-EEAQTELPQAR (pE1R11) was assembled according to the method of Barany and Merrifield (19.Barany G. Merrifield R.B. Gross E. Meinhofer J. The Peptide: Analysis, Synthesis, Biology. 2. Academic Press, New York1980: 1-284Google Scholar) on 4-hydroxymethylphenoxymethylcopolystyrene and 1% divinylbenzene-preloaded resin (0.5–0.65 mmol; Perkin-Elmer) on an automated synthesizer (ABI 433A, Perkin-Elmer). To avoid derivatives with deletion, the N-terminal extremities without Fmoc2 were capped with a mixture of 4.75% acetic anhydride (Merck), 6.25% 2.0 m n,N-diisopropylethylamine, 1.5% 1m 1-hydroxybenzotriazole (Perkin-Elmer), and 87.5%N-methylpyrrolidone (Perkin-Elmer). The peptides were deprotected and removed from the resin with trifluoroacetic acid complemented with 10% methylphenylsulfide (Merck) and 5% ethanedithiol (Merck) as scavenger and with Fmoc on the N-terminal residue. Each deprotection step was monitored with a conductivity device. Purification was done on a Beckman HPLC apparatus (Gold system) equipped with a C8 reverse phase column (10 × 250 mm; Merck). Buffer A was water with 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid, and buffer B was acetonitrile with 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid. The elution gradient consisted of increasing the buffer B ratio from 20 to 40% in 40 min with a 2-ml/min flow rate. HPLC analysis was done with a C8 reverse phase column (4 × 125 mm; Merck) with same buffers, but with a gradient of 10–50% buffer B in 40 min and with a 0.8-ml/min flow rate. Electrospray mass spectrometry was carried out with a single quad PE-SCIEX API 150ex (Perkin-Elmer). Amino acid composition was analyzed on a Beckman Model 6300 amino acid analyzer. CD spectra were recorded at 37 °C with a 50-μm path length cell from 260 to 178 nm with a MARK VI UV CD spectrophotometer (Jobin-Yvon, Longjumeau, France). The instrument was calibrated with (+)-10-camphorsulfonic acid. A ratio of 2.1 was found between the positive CD band at 290.5 nm and the negative band at 192.5 nm. Data were collected at 0.5-nm intervals with a scan rate of 1 nm/min. CD spectra are reported as Δε/amide. The samples were in 20 mm phosphate buffer (pH 7). Protein concentrations (∼1 mg/ml) were determined by the Beckman Model 6300 amino acid analyzer. Calcite unit cell parameters were taken from the literature (20.Effenberger H. Mereiter H. Zema J. Z. Kristallogr. 1981; 156: 233-243Crossref Scopus (332) Google Scholar): space group R3̄c(rhombohedral system), Z = 6, a = 4.990 Å, and c = 17.002 Å. For partial charges on calcite atoms, the values of Catti et al. (21.Catti M. Pavese A. Apra E. Roetti C. Phys. Chem. Miner. 1993; 20: 104-110Crossref Scopus (26) Google Scholar) obtained fromab initio calculations were used: +1.865 e− on calcium, +1.075 e− on carbon, and −0.980 e−on oxygen. As the overall surface charge of calcite is neutral at physiological pH (22.Geffroy C. Interaction Mechanisms between Soluble Minerals and Anionic Polyelectrolytes. Ph.D. thesis. University of Franche-Comté, 1997Google Scholar), no specific surface charge or surface ionic species like -CO2− or -CO2H groups were taken into account. Periodic boundary conditions were applied on a simulation box to get rid of boundary effects. The simulation box size was chosen to allow the undecapeptide to move freely on the calcite surface. To avoid pE1R11adsorption under the top of the box where periodic boundary conditions replicate the calcite interface, a 100-Å box height was used. This height gave enough space for this undecapeptide to move over the calcite surface. Under these conditions, the (10 1̄4) and (112̄0) surface areas were 1411.52 Å2 (35 unit cells) and 2057.20 Å2 (42 unit cells), respectively. Finally, a slice depth of three unit cells was necessary to properly evaluate the interactions of the undecapeptide with calcite faces. DREIDING 2.21 (23.Mayo S.L. Olafson B.D. Goddard W.A. J. Chem. Phys. 1990; 94: 8897-8909Crossref Scopus (5250) Google Scholar) was used to determine the crystal lattice energy of calcite. We also employed DREIDING 2.21 to describe bonding (stretching, bending, torsion, and inversion potentials) and nonbonding (6–12 Lennard-Jones-like van der Waals, coulombic, and 10–12 Lennard-Jones-like hydrogen bond potentials) interactions. Long-range electrostatic interactions were computed using Ewald summation. Partial charges were computed using the qEq equilibration method, a geometry-sensitive charge assignment method implemented in the Cerius2 program package (MSI, San Diego, CA). To mimic the presence of the C-terminal part of lithostathine attached to the N-terminal undecapeptide through the COO−group of Arg11, this functional group was replaced by a -(C=O)C(CH3)3 group. Molecular dynamics simulations were carried out in the NVT ensemble (molecule number, volume, and temperature are kept constant during the simulation). They were performed with Cerius2 running on a Silicon Graphics R5000PC workstation. The simulation box contained a fixed calcite interface, representing either the (10 1̄4) or the (11 2̄0) face, and the pE1R11 peptide, whose coordinates were taken from x-ray data, without the carbohydrate moiety. A 0.5-fs integration step was used. Temperature was kept constant at 310 K using the Nosé-Hoover equation of motion with a 0.3 relaxation factor value that guaranteed a proper convergence of the dynamics simulation. No solvent molecules were added in our model. The undecapeptide was then introduced into the box and set at a 20-Å distance from the calcite interface. A typical dynamics simulation included a 20-ps relaxation period of the system during which the undecapeptide moved toward the calcite surface and reached rather stable location and conformation. It was followed by a simulation period of several tens of ps. Snapshots taken from the dynamics simulation trajectory files were then analyzed. The interaction energy between pE1R11 and the calcite surface was computed as the difference between the energy of the whole system and the energy of pE1R11 alone plus the energy of the calcite crystal. Ewald parameters were kept constant for all the calculations. As pE1R11coverage of the calcite surface could vary from one simulation snapshot to another, we expressed the undecapeptide-calcite interaction energyE i (J/mol of unit cell) in terms of microscopic adhesion work W i (J/m2) as proposed by Lin et al. (24.Lin C.H. Gabas N. Canselier J.-P. Pepe G. J. Cryst. Growth. 1998; 191: 791-802Crossref Scopus (40) Google Scholar): W i = −E i n 2/N A S hkl, where S hkl is the interface area,N A is the Avogadro number, andn 2 is the number of molecules each covering a contact area S c (S hkl =n 2 S c). The final refinement process was carried out with SHELX (25.Sheldrick G.M. Methods Enzymol. 1997; 276: 628-641Crossref PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar). Anisotropic temperature factor refinement led to subsequent R-factor and free R-factor values of 13.2 and 15.9, respectively, for all 32,058 reflections in the resolution range of 8.0 to 1.3 Å. X-ray data are provided in Table I. A Ramachandran plot (26.Ramakrishnan C. Ramachandran G.N. Biophys. J. 1965; 5: 909-933Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (696) Google Scholar) showed that 88.1% of the residues were in the most favored regions, and none of the non-glycine residues were in the disallowed regions (data not shown). The final model included 135 water molecules and the entire protein (144 residues) (Fig.1 A). Surprisingly for such a small protein, the complete high resolution structure of human lithostathine showed two domains: a well organized globular C-terminal domain (residues 14–144) (6.Bertrand J.A. Pignol D. Bernard J.P. Verdier J.-M. Dagorn J.C. Fontecilla-Camps J.-C. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 2678-2684Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar) and a flexible N-terminal region (residues 1–13) that do not interact. The C-terminal domain belongs to the C-type lectin superfamily, although it does not bind carbohydrate (6.Bertrand J.A. Pignol D. Bernard J.P. Verdier J.-M. Dagorn J.C. Fontecilla-Camps J.-C. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 2678-2684Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). It is separated from the N-terminal domain by the C-14–C-25 disulfide bridge. The N-terminal domain is a 13-residue peptide chain that stretches out of the heart shape of the C-type lectin domain. Three residues (positions 9–11) are involved in a helix turn motif that represented the only secondary element of this domain. As a result, the N-terminal domain was much more agitated in the crystal (averaged B-factor of 36 Å2) than the rest of the protein (averaged B-factor of 22 Å2). This is consistent with the fact that we needed x-ray data at 1.3-Å resolution to build this domain.Table IX-ray data collection parameters and refinement statisticsNative 1DerivativeNative 2Diffraction data Resolution (Å)1.51.61.3 Observations121,898124,141114,712 Unique reflections19,35617,62732,253 Completeness (%)98.299.395.4 R sym0.0420.0970.084Phasing statistics RmsaRoot mean square.

Open table in a new tab R- factor = (ΣhFo − Fc)/ΣhFo. Earlier studies have shown that lithostathine isO-glycosylated on Thr5 (27.De Reggi M. Capon C. Gharib B. Wieruszkeski J.M. Michel R. Fournet B. Eur. J. Biochem. 1995; 230: 503-510Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). During structure refinement, we observed a large electron density around Thr5, clearly indicating the presence ofO-linked sugars to the Thr5 side chain. This enhanced density of synthetic pE1R11 was confirmed by semi-empirical quantum chemical method calculations using the program MOPAC from the Cerius2 package (data not shown). This carbohydrate moiety was divided into two carbohydrate chains perpendicular to the protein backbone (Fig. 1 A). Furthermore, because of the high quality of our electron density maps (Fig. 1 B), it was possible to assign our isoform to isoform K (27.De Reggi M. Capon C. Gharib B. Wieruszkeski J.M. Michel R. Fournet B. Eur. J. Biochem. 1995; 230: 503-510Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar) and to build three sugar residues (NeuAc(α2–6)GalNAc(β1–3)Gal) out of the four forming the carbohydrate chain. In addition, mass spectroscopy results for the crystallized protein (17,199 Da) agreed very well with the theoretical weight of this isoform (17,194 Da) (data not shown). That the N-terminal domain remained disordered in the crystal prompted us to test the behavior of the synthetic counterpart, pE1R11, which is also an inhibitor of calcite crystal growth, under physiological conditions (pH 7, 37 °C). The CD spectrum (Fig. 2) was typical of a random coil structure (28.Johnson Jr., W.C. Methods Biochem. Anal. 1985; 31: 61-163Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and strengthened our x-ray data. The negative band near 200 nm had an intensity in the range of those observed with model peptides with no steric constraints or internal hydrogen bonds. Random coil CD spectra were characterized by an intense negative band at 200 nm due to π-π* transition and low intensity bands near 210 nm due to n-π* transitions (28.Johnson Jr., W.C. Methods Biochem. Anal. 1985; 31: 61-163Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). No typical secondary structures could be deduced from this spectrum. Similar results were obtained in trifluoroethanol or SDS (data not shown). Both x-ray and CD experiments therefore suggest that pE1R11 is a highly flexible molecule that can display many configurations depending on the environment. Calcite lattice energy computed with DREIDING 2.21 (2663 kJ·mol−1) was within 5% of that calculated from the Born-Fajans-Haber thermodynamic cycle (2804 kJ·mol−1, 29) and justified the use of this force field for our docking studies. (10 1̄4) and (11 2̄0) faces used in dynamics simulation are displayed in Fig. 3 (A andB, respectively). They both exhibit evenly spaced rows of calcium and carbonate ions. However, on the (10 1̄4) face, the planar carbonate ions are parallel to the surface and always the same OCO2 pattern. Conversely, on the (11 2̄0) face, Y-shaped carbonate ions display alternately one and two protruding oxygen atoms. In addition, row spacing is different: 6.358 Å on the (10 1̄4) face and 4.99 Å on the (11 2̄0) face. A qualitative analysis of the dynamics simulation trajectories showed that, as pE1R11approached the calcite face (10 1̄4) or (11 2̄0), it gradually unfolded (data not shown). Simultaneously, it attached to the calcite surface through electrostatic bonds between its oxygen atoms from C=O groups and calcium ions regularly emerging from the surface and by means of hydrogen bonds between its hydrogen atoms from N–H or O–H groups and oxygen atoms from the carbonate ions. This dual bonding strengthened the pE1R11-calcite surface interaction. Both types of bonds participated in the global interaction. Interestingly, we noticed that electrostatic bonds do not break during the course of simulation studies, which indicates very strong binding. Indeed, once the Casurface–Oundecapeptide bonds were established, the undecapeptide stayed rather still, only making or breaking hydrogen bonds. With such an inertia, the undecapeptide is a good crystal growth inhibitor candidate: it sticks to the calcite surface long enough to impede the attachment of crystal growth units and thus reduces the face growth rate. Furthermore, dynamics simulation assays with pE1R11 surrounded by water molecules showed a similar tendency, but convergence time was beyond our computer time capacity (data not shown). Fig.4 A shows a top view of the pE1R11 peptide adsorbed on the (10 1̄4) calcite interface. The most interesting feature was that pE1R11 was stabilized by 15 bonds: 5 hydrogen bonds (Hundecapeptide–Ocalcite surface) and 10 electrostatic bonds (Casurface–Oundecapeptide). These hydrogen bonds included four Ocalcite surface–H-Nundecapeptide bonds (two from backbone, Leu7 and pyro-Glu1; and two from lateral chains, Gln4 and Arg11) and one Ocalcite surface–H-O bond of the hydroxyl group of Thr5. Among the 10 electrostatic bonds, 9 showed the oxygen atom located just above the calcium ions, whereas one oxygen atom settled between two calcium ions (Casurface–Oundecapeptide–Casurface). Under these conditions, the Cacalcite surface–Oundecapeptide distance was 2.4 Å, but reached 2.5 Å when two calcium ions were involved in the bonding. Experimental measurements of Ca–O distances agreed on a 2.4-Å value regardless of the environment of the oxygen atom (30.Ohtaki H. Radnai T. Chem.

During the course of the dynamic simulations, the average number of Ca–O=Cundecapeptide and -CO2Ocalcite surface–Hundecapeptidebonds was 8 and 6, respectively. Average Ocalcite surface–Hundecapeptide, Ocalcite surface–H-Nundecapeptide, and Ocalcite surface–H-Oundecapeptide distances were 2.0, 2.8, and 2.9 Å, respectively, with an average O–H-N angle of 152°.

Four features could be deduced from these results. First, the nature of the pE1R11-calcite interaction was mostly coulombic (−175.4 kcal·mol−1), whereas van der Waals and hydrogen bonding contribution played a minor role (−26 and −12.8 kcal·mol−1, respectively). Second, these 15 strong bonds represented little more than 60% of the total energy interaction, although neither the Casurface–O=Cundecapeptide bond nor the hydrogen bond contributions to the total energy prevailed. The remaining amount was due to weak attractive van der Waals and coulombic interactions. Third, Cacalcite surface–O=Cundecapeptide bond stability was due to their coulombic nature (−105.6 kcal·mol−1), whereas the stability of the five hydrogen bonds was due to both their coulombic and hydrogen nature (−37.5 and −11.4 kcal·mol−1, respectively). Last, for all those bonds, the van der Waals contribution to the interaction energy with the (10 1̄4) calcite interface was positive because the repulsive term of the van der Waals potential dominates its attractive term at the short distances involved.Table IIEnergy values related to the pE1R11-(10 1̄ 4) interface interactionCrystal face–undecapeptide bond typeInteraction typevan der WaalsCoulombicaComputed using a dielectric constant (ɛ) value equal to 1.Hydrogen bondTotalkcal·mol −1pE1R11−26.0−175.4−12.8−214.25 Osurface–H-Nundecapeptidebonds+8.0−37.5−11.4−40.910 Casurface–OCundecapeptidebonds+15.2−105.6−90.4The 15 bonds identified, as well as the splitting of the total interaction energy in terms of interaction type (6–12 Lennard-Jones-like van der Waals type, coulombic type, and 10–12 Lennard-Jones-like hydrogen bond type), are shown.

Furthermore, the TRE confers repression by T3 to an heterologous promoter only when inserted downstream of the transcription initiation site. Binding of CCCTC binding factor and TR to their cognate sites in the region of transcriptional attenuation, as well as direct interactions between both factors, could facilitate the formation of a repressor complex and the inhibition of c-myc gene expression.

These receptors are ligand-inducible transcription factors that exert their actions by binding, preferentially as heterodimers with the retinoid receptor RXR, to hormone response elements (TREs) located in regulatory regions of target genes (1.Mangelsdorf D.J.

Naturally occurring and synthetic TREs are normally composed of at least two copies of the consensus AGGTCA motif arranged as direct repeats, palindromes, or inverted palindromes (IPs) separated by a variable number of nucleotides. The thyroid hormones are essential for brain development, although the specific mechanisms by which these hormones control neuronal proliferation and differentiation are not yet understood. It has been shown that T3 treatment of N2a-β cells (a murine neuroblastoma cell line that overexpresses the TRβ1 isoform) blocks proliferation by an arrest of cells in G0/G1 and induces morphological and functional differentiation (3.Lebel J.M.

One of the molecular events required for cell cycle progression is the inactivation by hyperphosphorylation of retinoblastoma protein (pRb) family members (5.Weinberg R.A. Cell. 1995; 81: 323-330Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (4309) Google Scholar), which is catalyzed by the cyclin-dependent kinases or CDKs. We have recently shown that T3 induces a strong and sustained increase of the levels of the cyclin kinase inhibitor p27Kip1 in N2a-β cells. As a consequence, the kinase activity associated with CDK2 complexes is inhibited and pRB proteins are hypophosphorylated in T3-treated N2a-β cells (6.Perez-Juste G. Aranda A. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 5026-5031Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). The c-myc proto-oncogene encodes a nuclear phosphoprotein with leucine zipper and helix-loop-helix domains, which can cause transcriptional activation as well as transcriptional repression, and also plays an important role in cell cycle progression (7.Henriksson M. Lusche B. Adv. Cancer Res. 1996; 68: 109-182Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 8.Marcu K.B. Bossone S.A. Patel A.J. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1992; 61: 809-860Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 9.Ryan K.M. Birnie G.D. Biochem. J. 1996; 314: 713-721Crossref PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar). Although the mechanisms connecting c-Myc function to cell cycle control are not well understood, different signals that arrest growth and elicit cell differentiation suppress c-myc expression. Conversely, elevated levels of c-Myc prevent differentiation and lead to continued growth in many lineages. Thus, regulation of c-mycexpression appears to play an important role in decisions of cellular growth versus differentiation. Therefore, it would not be surprising that T3 could repress c-myc. Indeed, we have observed that the effect of T3 on p27Kip1 and N2a-β cells differentiation is accompanied by a decrease in c-Myc protein and c-myc mRNA levels (6.Perez-Juste G. Aranda A. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 5026-5031Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). Transcription of the c-myc gene is controlled by several promoters in mice, humans, and chickens. The two major promoters P1 and P2, which are positioned 164 base pairs apart in mice, contribute to more than 95% of the cytoplasmic c-myc mRNAs (9.Ryan K.M. Birnie G.D. Biochem. J. 1996; 314: 713-721Crossref PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar). Analysis of these regions has shown that numerous positive and negative regulatory elements are important for transcriptional regulation of the c-myc gene. One region which lies −65 to −58 base pairs upstream of the P2 promoter and appears to be essential for c-myc activation is bound by the cell cycle-regulated transcription factor E2F (8.Marcu K.B. Bossone S.A. Patel A.J. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1992; 61: 809-860Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In addition, a block in transcriptional elongation plays an important role in the regulation of c-myc gene expression (9.Ryan K.M. Birnie G.D. Biochem. J. 1996; 314: 713-721Crossref PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar). The regions responsible for transcriptional blockage within c-myc have been defined (10.Bentley D.L. Groudine M. Cell. 1988; 53: 245-256Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar,11.Wright S. Bishop J.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1989; 86: 505-509Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). It has been shown that the sequences responsible for premature termination are found proximal to the P2 promoter. The site involved is known to function as a RNA polymerase II pausing region (12.Krumm A. Meulia T. Brunvand M. Groudine M. Genes Dev. 1992; 6: 2201-2213Crossref PubMed Scopus (221) Google Scholar, 13.Krumm A. Hickey L.B. Groudine M. Genes Dev. 1995; 9: 559-572Crossref PubMed Scopus (192) Google Scholar). An 11-zinc finger transcriptional repressor CTCF binds immediately downstream of the P2 promoter at a sequence that maps precisely within the region of the polymerase II pausing and release (14.Klenova E.M. Nicolas R.H. Peterson H.F. Carne A.F. Heath C.M. Goodwin G.H. Neiman P.E. Lobanenkov V.V. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 7612-7624Crossref PubMed Scopus (234) Google Scholar). CTCF is an exceptionally conserved protein that uses different combinations of the 11 zinc fingers to specifically bind to diverged regulatory DNA sequences within the promoter proximal regions of chicken, mouse, and human c-myc genes (15.Filippova G.N. Fagerlie S. Klenova E.M. Myers C. Dhener Y. Goodwin G. Neiman P.E. Collins S.T. Lobanenkov V.V. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 2802-2813Crossref PubMed Scopus (423) Google Scholar). CTCF contains two strong transcriptional repressor domains, and mutation of the CTCF binding site results in increased transcription from human c-mycreporter constructs (15.Filippova G.N. Fagerlie S. Klenova E.M. Myers C. Dhener Y. Goodwin G. Neiman P.E. Collins S.T. Lobanenkov V.V. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 2802-2813Crossref PubMed Scopus (423) Google Scholar). Very recently it has been demonstrated that CTCF is required for the enhancer blocking activity of vertebrate insulators that can act as a barrier to the influence of neighboringcis-acting elements preventing gene activation (16.Bell A.C. West A.G. Fenselfeld G. Cell. 1999; 98: 387-396Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (866) Google Scholar). A transcriptional repressor, negative protein 1 or NeP1, which binds to the F1 element of the chicken lysozyme silencer, has been demonstrated to be identical to CTCF (17.Burcin M. Arnold R. Lutz M. Kaiser B. Runge D. Lottspeich F. Filippova G.N. Lobalenkov V.V. Renkawitz R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 1281-1288Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar). CTCF recognizes a sequence within the lysozyme gene silencer without any obvious sequence similarity to CTCF binding sites in the c-myc gene because of the different usage of zinc fingers (17.Burcin M. Arnold R. Lutz M. Kaiser B. Runge D. Lottspeich F. Filippova G.N. Lobalenkov V.V. Renkawitz R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 1281-1288Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar). Interestingly, the lysozyme silencer is comprised of two DNA response elements (F1 and F2), which synergistically repress gene activity (18.Baniahmad A. Steiner C. Khöne A.C. Renkawitz R. Cell. 1990; 61: 505-514Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (368) Google Scholar). The F1 module is bound by CTCF and the F2 is bound by TR, the homologous viral oncoprotein v-ERBA, or the retinoic acid receptor (RAR) (15.Filippova G.N. Fagerlie S. Klenova E.M. Myers C. Dhener Y. Goodwin G. Neiman P.E. Collins S.T. Lobanenkov V.V. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 2802-2813Crossref PubMed Scopus (423) Google Scholar). Whereas the unliganded TR acts as a repressor, in the presence of T3 the two silencer modules can synergistically activate gene transcription (18.Baniahmad A. Steiner C. Khöne A.C. Renkawitz R. Cell. 1990; 61: 505-514Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (368) Google Scholar). In this work we have analyzed the effects of T3 on c-mycgene expression in neuroblastoma N2a-β cells. Our results show that the hormone causes an extremely rapid decrease of c-myctranscripts in N2a-β cells that is independent on de novoprotein synthesis. Transient transfection experiments and gel retardation assays showed the existence of a negative TRE located between nucleotides +239 and +268 in the region responsible for premature termination of transcription. This element is arranged as an IP with a 3-nucleotide gap (IP3), binds TR-RXR heterodimers, and is adjacent to the CTCF binding site. A promoter fragment (+140 to +266) containing binding sites for both transcription factors confers repression by T3 to an heterologous promoter but only when inserted 3′ of the promoter. These results indicate the direct implication of TR in premature termination of transcription leading in cooperation with CTCF to polymerase II pausing and release and to a decrease of c-myc mRNA levels. The clonal cell line Neuro-2a stably transfected with the β1 isoform of the human thyroid hormone receptor (N2a-β cells) was grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% (v/v) T3-depleted serum as described previously (3.Lebel J.M. Dussault J.H. Puymirat J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 2644-2648Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar, 6.Perez-Juste G. Aranda A. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 5026-5031Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). Thyroid hormones were stripped from the serum by treatment with resin AG1 × 8. Total RNA was extracted from the cell cultures with guanidine thiocyanate. The RNA was run in 1% formaldehyde-agarose gels and transferred to nylon-nitrocellulose membranes (Nytran) for Northern blot analysis. The RNA was stained with 0.02% methylene blue. The blots were hybridized with a labeled cDNA probe for c-myc (a 1.4-kilobaseEcoRI/HindIII fragment from the human c-myc 3′-exon). Quantification of mRNA levels was carried out by densitometric scan of the autoradiograms. The values obtained were always corrected by the amount of RNA applied in each lane, which was determined by densitometry of the stained membranes. Constructs containing different fragments of the mouse c-myc promoter were originated from genomic clone 18 (19.Lavenu A. Pournin S. Babinet C. Morello D. Oncogene. 1994; 9: 527-536PubMed Google Scholar). [-1141/+516]-mmyc-CAT was obtained by digestion withPstI and XhoI and cloned into ΔpBLCAT3 in which a 195-base pair fragment was removed by digestion with NdeI and Eco0109. This treatment deletes an AP-1 element present in the plasmid backbone that can influence T3 responses (20.Kushner P.J. Baxter J.D. Duncan K.G. Lopez G.N. Schaufele F. Uth R.M. Webb P. West B.L. Mol. Endocrinol. 1994; 8: 405-407PubMed Google Scholar). (+137/+516)-mmyc-CAT was obtained by digestion with HindIII and XhoI. The fragment AvaI/BamHI was cloned in the SalI and BamHI sites of ΔpBLCAT3 to give (−140/+113)-mmyc-CAT. HindIII digestion was used to obtain (+140/+335)-mmyc-CAT. The oligonucleotides 5′-AAAGGATCCTTTTCGGGCGTT-3′ and 5′-CTCGGATCCCGAAGCTGCCTT-3′ were used as primers to obtain the fragment +140 to +269 by polymerase chain reaction. This fragment was cloned either 3′ (in the BglII site) or 5′ (in the BamHI site) of the thymidine kinase promoter of ΔpBLCAT2 to give TK-(+140/+269)-CAT and [+140/+269]-TK-CAT, respectively. The same fragment with the TRE mutated was obtained using the reverse oligonucleotide 5′-CTCGGATCCCGAAGCTGGATTCTTATTTCGCCCC-3′. This fragment was cloned in the BglII site of ΔpBLCAT2 to obtain TK-(+140/+266mut)-CAT. N2a-β cells were plated 24 h prior to transfection into 60-mm dishes. The cells were transfected with calcium phosphate with 5 μg of the reporter plasmid (plus 1 μg of a luciferase internal control plasmid). After 16 h of incubation the precipitates were washed and the treatments with T3 (5 nm) were administered in medium containing 10% resin-treated serum. CAT activity was determined in the cell extracts with [14C]chloramphenicol. The unreacted and acetylated [14C]chloramphenicol was separated by thin layer chromatography and quantified with an Instantimager. Treatment with T3 was performed in triplicate cultures that normally exhibited less than 10% variation in CAT activity, and the experiments were repeated at least two or three times with similar relative differences in regulated expression. The results are expressed as the mean ± S.D. of the CAT values obtained. Nuclear extracts of N2a-β cells, as well as purified proteins, were used for gel retardation assays. Highly purified TR-RXR heterodimers (>80% purity) were obtained after vaccinia coinfection of HeLa cells (21.Valcarcel R. Holtz H. Garcı́a-Jiménez C. Barettino D. Stunenberg H. Genes Dev. 1995; 8: 3068-3079Crossref Scopus (59) Google Scholar). Recombinant GST-TR and GST-RXR (22.Hadzic E. Desai-Janick V. Helmer E. Guo S. Wu S. Koudinova N. Casanova J. Raaka B.M. Samuels H.H.

They were grown at 37 °C in 2 XYT (16 g/liter Tryptone, yeast extract, 5 g/liter NaCl (pH 7)) until the absorbance reached 0.6. Then the induction was performed at 30 °C for 3 h with 0.4 mmisopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside. The expression of correctly sized proteins was monitored by SDS-PAGE. CTCF purified from HeLa cells was a kind gift from R. Arnold. The sequence of the oligonucleotides TREmmyc corresponding to sequences +239 to +268 of the murine c-myc gene and the mutant oligonucleotides designated as IP3 and IP8 used in the assays are shown in Fig. 4. For the binding reaction, the nuclear extracts (10 μg) or purified proteins (100 ng) were incubated at room temperature for 15 min at 4 °C in a buffer (10 mm Hepes-KOH (pH 7.9), 80 mm KCl, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 5% Ficoll) containing 3 μg of poly(dI-dC) and then for 30 min at room temperature with approximately 30,000 cpm of labeled double-stranded oligonucleotide labeled with [32P]dCTP. The fragment +140 to +269, amplified with the primers indicated above, as well as the same fragment with the mutated TRE were also used in the assays. In addition, a labeled fragment of the murine c-myc promoter (from +137 to +335) was obtained by polymerase chain reaction using the primers 5′-AAGCTTTTCGGGCGTTTTTTTCTG-3′ and 5′-GCTGATGTTGGGTCAGTCGCAGGG-3′. For supershift experiments, 1 μl of specific antibodies against RXR (which recognizes the different receptor isoforms) and CTCF (17.Burcin M. Arnold R. Lutz M. Kaiser B. Runge D. Lottspeich F.

Biol. 1997; 17: 1281-1288Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar) were added to the binding reactions and incubated on ice for 30 min before the addition of the labeled probe. For competition experiments an excess of unlabeled double-stranded oligonucleotides or polymerase chain reaction fragment was added to the binding reaction mixture. The competitor oligonucleotide TREpal contains the palindromic element 5′-AGGTCATGACCT-3′, and the F1 probe contains the CTCF binding element of the lysozyme silencer (18.Baniahmad A. Steiner C. Khöne A.C. Renkawitz R. Cell. 1990; 61: 505-514Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (368) Google Scholar). DNA-protein complexes were resolved on 6% polyacrylamide gels in 0.5× Tris borate-EDTA buffer. The gels were then fixed, dried, and autoradiographed at −70° C. GST pull-down assays were performed with 5 μl ofl-[35S]methionine-labeled CTCF, and the GST fusion proteins GST-TR and GST-RXR. An N-terminally truncated TR, GST-TR-(120–408), lacking the A/B domain and the DNA binding domain (22.Hadzic E. Desai-Janick V. Helmer E. Guo S. Wu S. Koudinova N. Casanova J. Raaka B.M. Samuels H.H.

Labeled CTCF was incubated with 1 μg of GST-fusion protein or with the same amount of GST as a control immobilized in glutathione-Sepharose beads. The proteins were first incubated in the presence of 1 μm T3 or ethanol for 20 min at room temperature in glass tubes. The reaction with the beads was performed for 1 h at 4 °C in a binding buffer containing 25 mm Hepes-KOH, pH 7.9, 1% glycerol, 5 mmMg2Cl, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 0.05% Triton X-100, 5 mm EDTA, and 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride. Free proteins were washed from the beads with a buffer containing 100 mm KCl, and the bound proteins were analyzed by SDS-PAGE and autoradiography. Whole cell extracts from N2aβ cells were prepared with 25 mm Hepes-KOH, pH 7.9, 0.1% Nonidet P-40, 150 mm KCl, 2 mm EDTA, 10 mmNaFl, 1 mm dithiothreitol, and 0.25% bovine serum albumin. GST alone or GST-TR (1 μg) was exposed to 700 μg of cell extract. Proteins were eluted from the resin and resolved by SDS-PAGE. CTCF was detected by Western blot with the CTCF antibody at a 1:2000 dilution. For immunoprecipitation the cells were harvested in 400 μl of lysis buffer, and 700 μg of cell extract were incubated with 2 μg of anti-TR antibody (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) for 2 h at 4 °C. Protein A-Sepharose was added and the incubation proceed for 1 additional h. The immunocomplexes were resolved by SDS-PAGE and analyzed by Western blot with the CTCF antibody. We have previously observed that the levels of c-Myc and c-mycmRNA were reduced in N2a-β cells treated with T3 for 48 h (6.Perez-Juste G. Aranda A. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 5026-5031Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). Fig. 1 A shows the kinetics of reduction of c-myc mRNA. T3 produced a rapid decrease of this transcript with a maximal reduction found only after 2 h of incubation with the hormone. This decrease was maintained for at least 48 h. To analyze whether de novo protein synthesis was required for T3 repression of c-myc gene expression, treatment with the hormone was performed in the presence and absence of 10 μm cycloheximide. As shown in Fig.1 B, cycloheximide increased c-myc mRNA levels. Superinduction in the absence of protein synthesis is characteristic of “early response” genes, which have transcripts with short half-lives. Treatment with T3 for 4 h caused a reduction of basal c-myc mRNA and was able to significantly decrease the levels found in cells incubated with cycloheximide. These results indicate that the effect of the hormone does not require previous synthesis of proteins and suggest that repression of c-myc gene expression might represent a direct transcriptional action of the thyroid hormone receptor on the c-myc gene. To directly examine whether the reduction of c-myc transcripts following T3 treatment of N2a-β cells is exerted at a transcriptional level, reporter constructs containing different fragments of the murine c-myc promoter region were used in transient transfection studies. Fig.2 A shows that incubation with 5 nm T3 for 48 h reduced by approximately 70% the activity of (−1141/+516)-mmyc-CAT. A similar reduction was observed with the reporter (−140/+335)-mmyc-CAT. This result shows that the region between −140 and +335, which includes both the P1 and the P2 promoters, contains the sequences required for transcriptional repression by T3. In contrast, the activity of the ΔpBLCAT3 construct was very low and was not affected by incubation with T3 (not illustrated). To further map the elements responsible for this regulation, two additional plasmids (−140/+113)-mmyc-CAT and (+137/+516)-mmyc-CAT were also used. The first construct includes sequences upstream of the P1 promoter, and the second one comprises P2 and sequences downstream of this site including the premature termination region. When assayed after 48 h of treatment with T3, the activity of both promoters was similarly repressed by the hormone. However, the kinetics of repression were different. As illustrated in Fig. 2 B, incubation with T3 prevented accumulation of CAT activity, which occurred during the period examined in the untreated cells. An inhibitory effect on the activity of (+137/+516)-mmyc-CAT was found at the first time period analyzed, namely at 3 h of incubation with T3. However, a reduction in the activity of the (−140/+113)-mmyc-CAT plasmid was not detected at 3 or 8 h of incubation and became apparent from 20 h of treatment. The sequences responsible for the rapid repression of c-myc gene transcription by T3 were analyzed for TR binding sites by gel retardation assays. The labeled promoter fragment +140/+335 was incubated with recombinant TR and/or RXR as fusions with GST. As illustrated in Fig. 3, this region did not bind RXR and only weakly TR, but when both receptors were combined a strong retardation was observed (lane 4).In vitro incubation with T3 did not significantly alter retardation (lane 5). The mobility of the GST fusion proteins is slower than that obtained with highly purified TR-RXR heterodimers obtained with vaccinia infection that is shown inlanes 14 and 15. The promoter fragment +132 to +269 (lanes 6–9) also bound TR-RXR heterodimers, indicating the existence of a TRE in this region. In contrast, when the fragment +140 to +335 was excised to give +140 to +249 and +249 to +335, the resulting fragments did not bind TR-RXR (lanes 10–13), suggesting that the TRE is located around the excision point. Analysis of the sequences comprised between +237 and +270 revealed the existence of the three potential TRE hemisites depicted in Fig.4 A as TREmmyc. Fig.4 B shows that the TREmmyc probe, as the promoter fragments, binds TR-RXR heterodimers (lane 4) but not TR or RXR separately. Although with a lower affinity, this element also bound RAR-RXR heterodimers (not illustrated). The TREmmyc could be organized as an inverted palindrome separated by 3 nucleotides (IP3) or with an 8-nucleotide gap (IP8). To determine the contribution of the different hemisites to receptor binding, two additional probes were used in which either the more downstream motif or the middle one were mutated to render an IP3 or an IP8 element, respectively (Fig. 4 A).Lane 8 in panel B shows that the IP8 bound weakly TR-RXR heterodimers, whereas the IP3 (lane 12) bound the receptors at least as strongly as the complete TREmmyc. The competition studies illustrated in the right panel in Fig. 4 Bfurther demonstrate the IP3 configuration of the response element. Whereas the TREmmyc and IP3 probes were equally effective in competing the retardation caused by TR-RXR on the native element, a large molar excess of IP8 oligonucleotide was unable to reduce binding. Binding of nuclear proteins to the TREmmyc is shown in Fig.4 C. Nuclear extracts from control N2a-β cells as well as from cells treated with T3 were subjected to gel retardation assays with the TREmmyc oligonucleotide. A predominant retarded complex with the same mobility as the purified TR-RXR heterodimer was formed with the cell extracts. T3 treatment did not alter the abundance of these complexes, which were competed equally well by the TREmmyc and by the palindromic element TREpal. In addition, the retarded complex was supershifted by an RXR antibody, demonstrating the presence of RXR heterodimers (most likely TR-RXR) in the protein-DNA complexes. This heterodimeric complex was not detected in nuclear extracts from parental N2a cells, which express low levels of thyroid hormone receptors (lane 16 and 17), confirming that TR-RXR are the major heterodimeric complexes bound to the TREmmyc. The nuclear complexes formed with the +140 tp +266 promoter fragment are illustrated in Fig. 5 A. Several retarded bands were observed with the nuclear extracts from either untreated or T3-treated N2a-β cells. The components of the different bands were again identified by the use of antibodies and competition with specific binding sites. The fastest complex had a mobility identical to that caused by the TR-RXR heterodimer, was displaced by an excess of TREpal, and supershifted by the anti-RXR antibody. These treatments did not affect the predominant complex, which has a slower mobility than the TR-RXR heterodimer. It has been recently described that the transcriptional repressor CTCF binds to a GC-rich region between positions +165 and +205 in the murine c-myc promoter (15.Filippova G.N. Fagerlie S. Klenova E.M. Myers C. Dhener Y. Goodwin G. Neiman P.E. Collins S.T. Lobanenkov V.V. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 2802-2813Crossref PubMed Scopus (423) Google Scholar). That the more abundant complex found in N2a-β cells corresponds to CTCF is demonstrated by the finding that this retarded band is abolished by an anti-CTCF antibody and competed by the F1 oligonucleotide. The F1 sequence of the lysozyme silencer is highly divergent from the CTCF binding site in the c-mycpromoter but also binds this factor effectively (17.Burcin M. Arnold R. Lutz M. Kaiser B. Runge D. Lottspeich F. Filippova G.N. Lobalenkov V.V. Renkawitz R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 1281-1288Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar). An additional complex with the slowest mobility was also detected in the nuclear extracts. This complex was disrupted in the presence of excess TREpal and F1 and by both the RXR and CTCF antibodies. Furthermore, when purified CTCF and TR-RXR were incubated with the promoter fragment, a new retarded band appeared that had the same mobility as this nuclear complex. Together, these observations demonstrate that this complex represents a ternary complex that contains both CTCF and receptor heterodimers. That the TREmmyc within the +140 to +265 promoter region is responsible for TR-RXR binding is shown in Fig. 5 B. This figure compares binding of the heterodimer a"

Expression of EGFP-syntaxin 6 resulted in a perinuclear distribution identical to endogenous syntaxin 6 as determined both by confocal fluorescence microscopy and subcellular fractionation. Furthermore, both the endogenous and the expressed EGFP-syntaxin 6 fusion protein were localized to a brefeldin A-insensitive but okadaic acid-sensitive compartment characteristic of the TGN. In contrast, EGFP-syntaxin 6 constructs lacking the H2 domain were excluded from the TGN and were instead primarily localized to the plasma membrane. Although syntaxin 4 was localized to the plasma membrane, syntaxin 6/syntaxin 4 chimerae and syntaxin 6 truncations containing the H2 domain of syntaxin 6 were predominantly directed to the TGN. Importantly, the syntaxin 6 H2 domain fused to the transmembrane domain of syntaxin 4 was also localized to the TGN, demonstrating that the H2 domain was sufficient to confer TGN localization. In addition to the H2 domain, a tyrosine-based plasma membrane internalization signal (YGRL) was identified between the H1 and H2 domains of syntaxin 6. Deletion of this sequence resulted in the accumulation of the EGFP-syntaxin 6 reporter construct at the plasma membrane. Together, these data demonstrate that syntaxin 6 utilizes two distinct domains to drive its specific subcellular localization to the TGN.

These compartments serve multiple functions including the organized delivery of proteins to various intracellular destinations, a process accomplished largely through vesicular trafficking events (1.Palade G. Science. 1975; 189: 347-358Crossref PubMed Scopus (2341) Google Scholar, 2.Bennett M.K. Scheller R.H. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1994; 63: 63-100Crossref PubMed Scopus (233) Google Scholar, 3.Jahn R.

Despite the tremendous membrane lipid and protein flux through these intracellular trafficking nodes, many proteins show a remarkably stable, compartment-specific distribution under steady state conditions. Since membrane proteins are thought to be transported vectorially along the secretory pathway, a given protein may transiently occupy several compartments en route to its final destination. Indeed, delivery of proteins to various intracellular destinations may in some cases require a series of sorting decisions. One critical sorting step occurs at the trans-Golgi network (TGN),1 where proteins with specific targeting signals are incorporated into vesicles with defined trafficking itineraries (5.Griffiths G. Simons K. Science. 1986; 234: 438-443Crossref PubMed Scopus (764) Google Scholar, 6.Keller P. Simons K. J. Cell Sci. 1997; 110: 3001-3009Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 7.Traub L.M. Kornfeld S. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1997; 9: 527-533Crossref PubMed Scopus (194) Google Scholar). In addition, retrieval signals are often employed to return wayward proteins back to their resident membrane compartments (8.Nilsson T. Warren G. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1994; 6: 517-521Crossref PubMed Scopus (213) Google Scholar, 9.Sato M. Sato K. Nakano A. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 134: 279-293Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar, 10.Stanley K.K. Mol.

Sonnichsen B. Shima D.T. Nilsson T. Warren G. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1997; 8: 1777-1787Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). In contrast, membrane proteins without specific sorting signals are transported along the entire secretory pathway and accumulate at the plasma membrane under steady-state conditions (13.Pfeffer S.R. Rothman J.E. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1987; 56: 829-852Crossref PubMed Scopus (620) Google Scholar). Our understanding of vesicular trafficking is largely based on detailed studies of endoplasmic reticulum to Golgi trafficking and in the docking and fusion of synaptic vesicles with the presynaptic membrane (14.Rothman J.E. Orci L. Nature. 1992; 355: 409-415Crossref PubMed Scopus (744) Google Scholar, 15.Rothman J.E. Nature. 1994; 372: 55-63Crossref PubMed Scopus (2007) Google Scholar, 16.Rothman J.E. Warren G. Curr. Biol. 1994; 4: 220-233Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (481) Google Scholar). From these studies arose the SNARE hypothesis, which proposes that regulated interactions between v-SNAREs of donor membranes and t-SNAREs of acceptor membranes impart specificity to membrane trafficking and fusion events (14.Rothman J.E. Orci L. Nature. 1992; 355: 409-415Crossref PubMed Scopus (744) Google Scholar, 15.Rothman J.E. Nature. 1994; 372: 55-63Crossref PubMed Scopus (2007) Google Scholar, 16.Rothman J.E. Warren G. Curr. Biol. 1994; 4: 220-233Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (481) Google Scholar). However, analysis of specific v- and t-SNARE binding interactions demonstrate a high degree of promiscuity, at least in vitro (17.Fasshauer D. Antonin W. Margittai M. Pabst S. Jahn R. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274 (11546): 15440Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (244) Google Scholar, 18.Yang B. Gonzalez Jr., L. Prekeris R. Steegmaier M. Advani R.J. Scheller R.H. J. Biol.

Although additional accessory proteins may help to ensure binding selectivity, segregating v- and t-SNAREs in specific compartments may contribute significantly to membrane fusion specificity. To date, 16 mammalian syntaxin family members have been identified, all of which localize to specific membrane compartments along the exocytic and endocytic pathways. The first group of syntaxins identified (syntaxins 1–4) are predominantly restricted to the plasma membrane, where they mediate constitutive and regulated vesicle trafficking events at the cell surface (19.Bennett M.K.

In contrast, syntaxins 5, 6, 10, 11, and 16 are localized to different subcompartments within the Golgi apparatus (22.Dascher C. Matteson J. Balch W.E. J. Biol.

Although the mechanisms and protein interaction domains responsible for v-SNARE localization have been investigated, there is less information with regard to the targeting of the syntaxin family of t-SNARE proteins, particularly in mammalian cells. Therefore, to further our understanding of t-SNARE targeting we have examined the functional domains of syntaxin 6, a t-SNARE localized to the TGN (23.Bock J.B. Lin R.C. Scheller R.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 17961-17965Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar). We show here that the cytosolic H2 domain of syntaxin 6 plays a major role in TGN localization. Furthermore, the predicted α-helical H2 domain functions in concert with a YGRL plasma membrane retrieval sequence, resulting in a highly efficient mechanism for maintaining syntaxin 6 in the TGN. Brefeldin A (Sigma) was prepared as a 5 mg/ml stock in methanol and used at a final concentration of 5 μg/ml. Okadaic acid (Calbiochem) was kept as a 100 μm stock in dimethyl sulfoxide and used at a final concentration of 0.5 μm. Supersignal and Supersignal Ultra enhanced chemiluminescence reagents were purchased from Pierce and used according to the manufacturer's directions. Syntaxin 4 polyclonal antibody was obtained as described previously (30.Olson A.L. Knight J.B. Pessin J.E. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 2425-3245Crossref PubMed Scopus (209) Google Scholar). The syntaxin 6 monoclonal antibody was purchased from Transduction Laboratories. EGFP polyclonal antibody was purchased from CLONTECH. Transferrin receptor antibody was from Zymed Laboratories Inc. Grb2 antibody was from Santa Cruz. The cation-independent mannose 6-phosphate receptor (M6PR) antibody was a gift from Dr. Richard G. MacDonald, University of Nebraska. Antibodies directed against the Golgi specific resident protein giantin were kindly provided by Dr. Isabelle Moosbrugger, Institute of Immunology and Molecular Genetics, Karlsrue, Germany. Fluorescent secondary antibodies were purchased from Jackson Immunoresearch Laboratories. Horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibodies were purchased from Pierce. The full-length syntaxin 6 cDNA was obtained by PCR amplification from a mouse fat cDNA library (CLONTECH) and was also provided by Dr. Richard H. Scheller, Stanford University School of Medicine. To generate the amino-terminal EGFP fusion constructs, the polymerase chain reaction was used to introduce appropriate restriction enzyme sites on the 5′ and 3′ termini of cDNAs encoding syntaxins 4 and 6. The PCR products were then cloned in-frame with the EGFP coding sequence of the pEGFP-C series vectors (CLONTECH). Syntaxin chimeras and internal deletion constructs were generated using the PCR-based overlap extension method as described (31.Horton R.M. Ho S.N. Pullen J.K. Hunt H.D. Cai Z. Pease L.R. Methods Enzymol. 1993; 217: 270-279Crossref PubMed Scopus (430) Google Scholar). Truncations of the syntaxin 6 cDNAs were generated by PCR using internal primers that hybridized to the specific region of interest. The PCR products were then cloned in frame with EGFP. To generate the Syn6(YGRL/Δ234) and Syn6(AGRL/Δ234) constructs, synthetic oligonucleotides encoding the sequences TDRYGRLDRE or TDRAGRLDRE were cloned in-frame with the syntaxin 6 transmembrane domain. Murine 3T3L1 preadipocytes were purchased from the American Type Tissue Culture repository. Cells were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 25 mm glucose and 10% calf serum at 37 °C with 8% CO2. Cells were differentiated into adipocytes with 1 μg/ml insulin, 1 mm dexamethasone, and 0.5 mmisobutyl-1-methylxanthine as described previously (31.Horton R.M. Ho S.N. Pullen J.K. Hunt H.D. Cai Z. Pease L.R. Methods Enzymol. 1993; 217: 270-279Crossref PubMed Scopus (430) Google Scholar). Adipocytes were used in experiments 9–11 days after the initiation of differentiation and were electroporated using the Gene Pulser II (Bio-Rad) with settings of 0.16 kV and 960 microfarads. Unless otherwise specified, 50 μg of DNA was used for electroporation. Following electroporation, cells were plated on glass coverslips and allowed to recover for 20–36 h in complete medium prior to fixing. Adipocytes expressing the EGFP fusion constructs were washed in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) and fixed for 20 min in 4% paraformaldehyde. Cells were then quenched for 20 min in 100 mm glycine, washed in PBS, and mounted on glass slides using one drop of Vectashield (Vector Laboratories). Cells were imaged using confocal fluorescence microscopy. Images were then imported into Adobe Photoshop (Adobe Systems Inc.) and composite files generated. For immunofluorescence of endogenous proteins, the adipocytes were plated on glass coverslips and fixed as described above except that 20 μg/ml saponin was added to the 4% paraformaldehyde. Cells were washed in PBS and blocked in 5% donkey serum (Sigma), 1% bovine serum albumin (Sigma) for 1 h. Primary and secondary antibodies were used at 1:100 dilutions in blocking solution, and the samples were analyzed by confocal fluorescent microscopy as indicated above. Differential centrifugation was used to fractionate adipocytes as described previously (32.Simpson I.A. Yver D.R. Hissin P.J. Wardzala L.J. Karnieli E. Salans L.B. Cushman S.W. Biochim. Biophys.

Briefly, cells were washed in PBS and resuspended in HES buffer (20 mm HEPES, pH 7.4, 1 mm EDTA, 255 mm sucrose, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 10 μg/ml pepstatin, 10 μg/ml aprotinin, 5 μg/ml leupeptin). Cells were then sheared by 10 passages through a 22-gauge needle and centrifuged at 19,000 × g for 20 min at 4 °C. The supernatant was centrifuged at 41,000 × gfor 20 min at 4 °C, yielding the low speed pellet (LSP) and a supernatant that was further divided into the high speed pellet (HSP) and cytosolic fraction by centrifugation at 180,000 ×g for 75 min at 4 °C. A plasma membrane fraction was obtained by layering the pellet from the initial 19,000 ×g centrifugation step onto a 1.12 m sucrose cushion followed by centrifugation at 100,000 × g for 60 min at 4 °C. The plasma membrane layer was removed from the sucrose cushion with a Pasteur pipette and centrifuged at 40,000 × g for 20 min at 4 °C. Total protein in all fractions was then quantitated using the BCA protein assay kit (Pierce). Equal protein amounts from each of the subcellular fractions were loaded onto 5–15% gradient SDS-polyacrylamide gels, electrophoresed, transferred to nitrocellulose membranes, and immunoblotted with antibodies against the cation-independent M6PR, transferrin receptor (TfR), syntaxin 4 (Syn4), syntaxin 6 (Syn6), EGFP, and Grb2. Previous studies in several fibroblast cell lines have indicated that syntaxin 6 is predominantly localized to the TGN (23.Bock J.B. Lin R.C. Scheller R.H. J. Biol.

To examine the distribution of syntaxin 6 in 3T3L1 adipocytes, we compared the localization of endogenous syntaxin 6 with the Golgi marker giantin by immunofluorescence confocal microscopy (Fig.1, panels a andd). Giantin was primarily concentrated in the perinuclear region with a small amount of diffuse background staining throughout the cell (Fig. 1, panel a). Syntaxin 6 was also enriched in the perinuclear region with a low but significant level at the plasma membrane under steady-state conditions (Fig. 1,panel d). This membrane distribution is similar to what has been reported for other TGN resident proteins, including TGN38 and furin (36.Luzio J.P. Brake B. Banting G. Howell K.E. Braghetta P. Stanley K.K.

Similarly, expression of an EGFP-syntaxin 6 fusion protein (EGFP-Syn6) resulted in a predominantly perinuclear distribution with a small amount of plasma membrane localization (Fig.1, panel g). To confirm that both endogenous syntaxin 6 and EGFP-Syn6 were specifically localized to the TGN compartment, we took advantage of the differential effects of brefeldin A (BFA) and okadaic acid on the Golgi complex. BFA treatment induces the collapse or redistribution of the early Golgi membranes back into the endoplasmic reticulum, leaving the TGN to coalesce into a more spherical mass near the centrioles (45.Banting G. Ponnambalam S. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1997; 1355: 209-217Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar,46.Chardin P. McCormick F. Cell. 1999; 97: 153-155Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (316) Google Scholar). In contrast, okadaic acid disrupts the entire Golgi complex, including the TGN (47.Horn M. Banting G. Biochem. J. 1994; 301: 69-73Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). As expected, BFA and okadaic acid treatments resulted in the complete loss of perinuclear giantin labeling, consistent with a dissolution of the Golgi stack and entire Golgi complex, respectively (Fig. 1, panels b andc). In contrast, BFA treatment resulted in a more concentrated spherical distribution of both endogenous syntaxin 6 and expressed EGFP-Syn6, consistent with a TGN localization (Fig. 1,panels e and h). However, okadaic acid treatment induced a dispersed endogenous syntaxin 6 and EGFP-Syn6 fluorescence consistent with the disruption of the entire Golgi complex including the TGN (Fig. 1, panels f andi). The effects of BFA and okadaic acid are in excellent agreement to that previously reported for the TGN resident protein TGN38 (45.Banting G. Ponnambalam S. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1997; 1355: 209-217Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar, 47.Horn M. Banting G. Biochem. J. 1994; 301: 69-73Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). Together, these data demonstrate that endogenous syntaxin 6 as well as the expressed EGFP-Syn6 are both localized to the TGN in 3T3L1 adipocytes. Syntaxin 6 is predicted to contain two helical domains, H1 and H2, that are thought to form coiled-coil interactions with other proteins (23.Bock J.B. Lin R.C. Scheller R.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 17961-17965Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar). Similar to other syntaxin family members, syntaxin 6 also contains one transmembrane domain at the carboxyl terminus (Fig. 2). In contrast, based upon its close sequence similarity with syntaxin 1, syntaxin 4 is predicted to contain four helical domains, HA, HB, HC, and Hcore, as well as a carboxyl-terminal transmembrane domain (48.Sutton R. Fasshauer D. Jahn R. Brunger A. Nature. 1998; 395: 347-353Crossref PubMed Scopus (1916) Google Scholar,49.Fernandez I. Ubach J. Dulubova I. Zhang X. Sudhof T.C. Rizo J. Cell. 1998; 94: 841-849Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (263) Google Scholar). As depicted in Fig. 2, we initially generated a series of chimeric syntaxin 6/syntaxin 4 proteins containing EGFP fused at the cytoplasmic amino terminus. The chimera designated EGFP-Syn6(231)/Syn4(261) contains the amino-terminal 231 amino acids of syntaxin 6 fused in-frame with the transmembrane domain (amino acids 261–298) of syntaxin 4. Similarly, chimera EGFP-Syn6(160)/Syn4(185) contains the amino-terminal 160 amino acids of syntaxin 6 fused with amino acids 185–298 of syntaxin 4. We also generated two truncation mutants EGFP-Syn6(Δ160), truncated at amino acid 160 and EGFP-Syn6(Δ234), truncated at amino acid 234. In addition, chimera EGFP-Syn6(161–234)/Syn4(TM) was generated by fusing amino acids 161–234 of syntaxin 6 in-frame with the TM domain (amino acids 274–291) from syntaxin 4. As previously observed, the endogenous syntaxin 6 protein as well as expression of EGFP-Syn6 displayed the typical perinuclear distribution characteristic of the TGN as well as a relatively low level of plasma membrane localization (Fig. 3,panels a and b). In contrast to the TGN localization of syntaxin 6, both endogenous syntaxin 4 (data not shown) and EGFP-syntaxin 4 was localized predominantly to the plasma membrane (Fig. 3, panel e). Since integral membrane proteins lacking specific targeting signals localize to the plasma membrane by a default mechanism (13.Pfeffer S.R. Rothman J.E. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1987; 56: 829-852Crossref PubMed Scopus (620) Google Scholar), we reasoned that chimeric syntaxin 6/syntaxin 4 proteins would allow us to identify sequence motifs within syntaxin 6 necessary for TGN localization. Using this approach, expression of the EGFP-Syn6(231)/Syn4(261) chimera resulted in a predominant perinuclear localization, whereas expression of the Syn6(160)/Syn4(185) chimera was mainly localized to the plasma membrane (Fig. 3, panels c and d). The only distinct domain between these two chimerae that could account for perinuclear localization was the syntaxin 6 H2 domain. Therefore, we next examined two syntaxin 6 truncations, EGFP-Syn6(Δ160) ,which contains the H2 and transmembrane domains, and EGFP-Syn6(Δ234), which contains only the transmembrane domain. EGFP-Syn6(Δ160) showed a pronounced perinuclear distribution in addition to a plasma membrane localization, whereas EGFP-Syn6(Δ234) resulted in a diffuse intracellular signal along with a plasma membrane localization (Fig. 3,panels f and g). Furthermore, to demonstrate that the syntaxin 6 H2 domain was sufficient to confer a perinuclear distribution, we also examined the localization of a chimeric protein containing only the syntaxin 6 H2 domain fused to the syntaxin 4 transmembrane domain (Fig. 3, panel h). Consistent with the other chimeric and deletion constructs, EGFP-Syn6(161–234)/Syn4(TM) displayed a strong perinuclear localization. To ensure that the perinuclear distribution of the EGFP-Syn6(231)/Syn4(261), EGFP-Syn6(161–234)/Syn4(TM), and EGFP-Syn6(Δ160) constructs were indicative of the Golgi, we next examined the co-localization of these expressed fusion proteins with giantin or endogenous syntaxin 6 (Fig.4). Since the resolution afforded by confocal fluorescence microscopy is not sufficient to distinguish between the Golgi stacks and TGN, the distribution of giantin should overlap that of syntaxin 6. As expected, co-localization of giantin with EGFP-Syn6 demonstrated an identical perinuclear distribution (Fig.4 A, panels a–c). Similarly, there was a strong correspondence between the intracellular perinuclear distribution of giantin with the EGFP-Syn6(231)/Syn4(261) chimera (Fig. 4 A, panels d–f). In addition, since the EGFP-Syn6(Δ160) fusion only contains the transmembrane and H2 domains of syntaxin 6, we were able to co-localize this fusion protein with endogenous syntaxin 6 (Fig. 4 B). As is apparent, the expressed EGFP-Syn6(Δ160) construct displayed a distribution similar to endogenous syntaxin 6 (Fig. 4 B,panels a–c). Similarly, the EGFP-Syn6(161–234)/Syn4(TM) fusion protein was also predominantly co-localized with endogenous syntaxin 6. However, it is also important to note that both EGFP-Syn6(Δ160) and Syn6(161–234)/Syn4(TM) displayed a greater degree of plasma membrane localization than endogenous syntaxin 6, full-length EGFP-Syn6, or the Syn6(231)/Syn4(261) fusion proteins (see below). In any case, to confirm that these constructs were localized to the TGN rather than throughout the Golgi complex, cells were treated with BFA or okadaic acid. Treatment with BFA resulted in a more spherical and concentrated perinuclear distribution of EGFP-Syn6, EGFP-Syn6(231)/Syn4(261), EGFP-Syn6(Δ160), and EGFP-Syn6(161–234)/Syn4(TM), consistent with TGN localization (Fig.5, panels a,b, d, e, g, h,j, and k). In contrast, disruption of both the Golgi stack and TGN with okadaic acid resulted in the complete loss of perinuclear localized EGFP-Syn6, EGFP-Syn6(231)/Syn4(261), EGFP-Syn6(Δ160), and EGFP-Syn6(161–234)/Syn4(TM) (Fig. 5,panels c, f, i, andl). To further verify the localization of the key syntaxin constructs by an independent and more quantitative method, we used differential centrifugation to isolate subcellular membrane fractions from 3T3L1 adipocytes (Fig. 6). Cells were first electroporated with the EGFP fusion constructs, then collected, pooled, and centrifuged as described under “Experimental Procedures.” This protocol yielded HSP, LSP, PM, and cytosolic (CYT) fractions. To assess the efficacy of the fractionation procedure, we used several endogenous marker proteins known to localize to specific intracellular membrane compartments. The cation-independent M6PR is a marker for late endosomes and lysosomes and was partitioned in the HSP fraction. In contrast, TfR is primarily a marker for early endosomes but is also found in the TGN and plasma membrane and was partitioned predominantly into the LSP fraction, with lower levels in the PM fraction. As expected, syntaxin 4 partitioned mostly with the PM fraction, whereas syntaxin 6 partitioned mostly with the LSP fraction, with low but detectable levels in the PM fraction. The small cytosolic protein Grb2 was detected almost exclusively in the CYT fraction. Consistent with confocal fluorescence microscopy, EGFP-Syn6 was distributed in a similar pattern as that of the endogenous syntaxin 6 protein. The majority of the endogenous syntaxin 6 and EGFP-Syn6 fusion protein were found in the LSP fraction with a relatively small but significant amount in the PM fraction. In addition, the EGFP-Syn6(231)/Syn4(261) chimera also partitioned largely with the LSP fraction with lower levels detected in the PM fraction and was essentially indistinguishable from the endogenous syntaxin 6 and EGFP-Syn6 distribution. Although the EGFP-Syn6(Δ160) was detected in the LSP fraction, approximately equal amounts were found in the PM fraction. Similarly, the Syn6(161–234)/Syn4(TM) chimera also partitioned to the LSP and PM fractions at roughly equivalent levels. Thus, the subcellular fractionation of EGFP-Syn6(Δ160) and Syn6(161–234)/Syn4(TM) into the LSP fraction in combination with the confocal fluorescence localization of these constructs to the TGN compartment strongly implicates the syntaxin 6 H2 domain as an important TGN localization motif. Although the H2 domain can impart TGN localization, Western blot analysis revealed that the H2 domain alone may not direct TGN targeting as efficiently as the full-length syntaxin 6 or EGFP-Syn6(231)/Syn4(261) fusion p"

Advances in molecular genetics, transgenic mouse technology, and physiological measurements in mice provided an opportunity to go a step further and develop models to analyze the physiological significance of specific gene variants potentially causing hypertension. In this report, we describe the development of a human angiotensinogen transgenic mouse model generated by targeting the human angiotensinogen gene upstream of the mouse HPRT locus by homologous recombination. The main benefit of this transgenic mouse model is that the human angiotensinogen gene is inserted into the mouse genome as a single copy at a predefined locus and in a specific orientation—a process that can be repeated utilizing other variants of this gene. We establish the validity of this approach by showing that the hAGThprt mice have normal tissue- and cell-specific expression of the human angiotensinogen gene and normally produce and process the hAGT protein at physiological levels.

Since the angiotensinogen (AGT)1 gene was shown to be genetically linked to hypertension, there has been a search for specific mutations in the human AGT sequence that could be causative of the disorder (1.Jeunemaitre X.

Whereas a number of single nucleotide polymorphisms have been identified in the coding region, in introns, and within the promoter region of the gene, only one haplotype has been reported by independent research teams to associate with the hypertensive phenotype. This haplotype consists of two single base change alleles which exist in strong linkage disequilibrium, a G → A substitution at position −6 of the promoter and a T → C substitution in codon 235 changing it from methionine to threonine (2.Inoue I.

However, among dozens of linkage, association, and case-control studies on this subject, substantial controversy remains regarding the significance of this genetic alteration in hypertension (Ref. 9.Hingorani A.D.

Rep. 1999; 1: 31-41Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). The number of reports and their conflicting conclusions illustrate the difficulties encountered in addressing and understanding the genetics of polygenic diseases. Corvol et al. (15.Corvol P. Persu A. Gimenez-Roqueplo A.P. Jeunemaitre X. Hypertension. 1999; 33: 1324-1331Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar) recently described that it is very difficult to rigorously prove the significance of a genetic polymorphism utilizing only linkage analysis when the phenotype is polygenic and multifactorial in nature and when the populations are ethnically diverse. For example, the frequency of the −6A/235Thr allele is disproportionate among different ethnic groups, being prominent in African and Japanese populations whereas the −6G/235Met haplotype is predominant in people of European descent (2.Inoue I. Nakajima T. Williams C.S. Quackenbush J. Puryear R. Powers M. Cheng T. Ludwig E.H. Sharma A.M. Hata A. Jeunemaitre X. Lalouel J.M. J. Clin.

Browe C.S. Ross E.A. Biochem. Mol. Biol. Int. 1994; 34: 1271-1275PubMed Google Scholar). Because of these issues, studies must be performed in large populations to ensure adequate statistical power. Evidence of linkage is generally a statistical one governed by the modest excess of one allele in hypertensive over normotensive subjects. Thus, these studies can only establish an association between a phenotype and a gene but not prove causality. It is therefore essential to establish the significance of a genetic mutation experimentally by performing biochemical and functional studies. Understanding these limitations, we developed an experimental system using gene targeting to accurately assess the physiological significance of gene variation in the human AGT gene. The system is based on studies by us and others which established that: 1) the human renin and human AGT genes can functionally complement abnormalities in the mouse AGT gene induced by gene targeting (18.Davisson R.L. Kim H.S. Krege J.H. Lager D.J. Smithies O. Sigmund C.D. J. Clin. Invest. 1997; 99: 1258-1264Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar) and 2) that gene targeting can effectively deliver a transgene in a single copy to a selected locus in the genome (Ref. 19.Bronson S.K. Plaehn E.G. Kluckman K.D. Hagaman J.R. Maeda N. Smithies O. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 9067-9072Crossref PubMed Scopus (258) Google Scholar; and reviewed in Ref. 20.Cvetkovic, B., and Sigmund, C. D. (2000) Kidney Int., in pressGoogle Scholar). Here we report the development and characterization of a transgenic mouse model in which gene targeting at the HPRT locus was used to selectively target a single copy of the human AGT gene to a known site in the genome. We demonstrate that insertion of the single copy transgene upstream of HPRT does not affect the overall tissue- and cell-specific expression or hormonal regulation of human AGT. This study provides an important proof-of-principal that the functional significance of allelic variation in human AGT can be assessed by examining mice carrying transgenes targeted in a single copy to an identical insertion site. Genomic human AGT construct spanning all five exons and accompanying introns as well as 1.5 kb of 5′ and 0.3 kb of 3′ region was subcloned as a NotI fragment into a pMP8SKB HPRT vector (19.Bronson S.K. Plaehn E.G. Kluckman K.D. Hagaman J.R. Maeda N. Smithies O. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 9067-9072Crossref PubMed Scopus (258) Google Scholar), resulting in a 27-kb pMPGLM targeting vector. 107 BK4 ES cells were electroporated in ES cell medium (Dulbecco's modified Eagle's-Ham's medium withl-glutamine and glucose (4500 mg/l)) with 10 μg ofPvuI linearized pMPGLM plasmid using voltage and capacitance settings of 250V and 500 microfarads, respectively. ES cells were plated 1:4 on plates containing a layer of fibroblast feeder cells and were grown in ES cell culture media containing LIF (1000 u/ml) and 20% fetal calf serum. After 24 h, the media was substituted with selective HAT media (ES cell media containing LIF, fetal calf serum, hypoxanthine (0.016 mg/ml), aminopterin (0.175 μg/ml), and thymidine (0.0048 mg/ml)), and the cells were grown for one week. HAT-resistant colonies were isolated, expanded, and a portion used for DNA analysis. Chimeric mice were generated using routine procedures. Genomic DNA preparations from ES cells or mouse tails were used in a PCR reaction with oligonucleotides that specifically amplify 550 bp of human angiotensinogen sequence (5′-TGGTGCTAGTCGCTGCAAAACTTGACACCG-3′ and 5′-CAGGGAGCAGCCAGTCTTCCATCCTGTCAC-3′) as described previously (21.Yang G. Merrill D.C. Thompson M.W. Robillard J.E. Sigmund C.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 32497-32502Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Approximately 10 μg of genomic DNA from individual targeted ES cell clones, and/or control BK4 and R1 ES cells, was digested withBamHI enzyme overnight and resolved on a 0.8% agarose gel. Membranes were probed overnight with a radioactively labeled DNA probe which hybridizes to a 250-bp sequence located in the third intron of the endogenous HPRT gene. After washing, the membranes were analyzed using a Storm 820 PhosphorImagerTM system (Molecular Dynamics). Tissues were harvested following CO2 asphyxiation and snap-frozen in liquid N2, and RNA was prepared using TRI-Reagent (Molecular Research Corp.) as suggested by the manufacturer. For tissue-specific expression, 25 or 30 μg of individual RNA preparation (or the whole RNA preparation in case of tissues such as aorta and adrenal gland) was used per assay, and samples were resolved on a 0.5% agarose gel. Membranes were probed overnight with radioactively labeled RNA probe spanning nucleotides 302–931 of the human AGT cDNA sequence. After washing, the signals were detected using x-ray film (Kodak) or Storm 820 phosphorimager system (Molecular Dynamics). RPA was performed using HybSpeed RPA kit (Ambion) according to manufacturer's specifications. Each RNA sample was incubated with the human AGT and mouse actin probes (specific activity ≈20,000 cpm) which resulted in protected fragments of 518 and 250 bp, respectively. All samples were run on the same gel and bands quantified using Storm 820 PhosphorImagerTM system and ImageQuant Version 4.0 software (Molecular Dynamics). Data was normalized using mouse actin and analyzed using SigmaStat graphing program. For immunocytochemical analysis, kidney and liver segments were isolated from either transgenic mice or nontransgenic littermates and fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde for 2 h, transferred to 30% sucrose solution, and kept at 4 °C overnight. Next day, tissues were frozen in OCT and sectioned at 8–10 μm. Slides were rinsed with Superblock (Pierce) for 5 min followed by a 10-min incubation with 0.1% Triton X-100 in Superblock at room temperature. Permeabilized sections were then incubated with rabbit anti-human AGT primary antibody overnight at 4 °C. The slides were washed with phosphate-buffered saline (3× for 10 min), incubated with secondary Cy3-labeled donkey anti-rabbit antibody at 37 °C for 2 h, and washed again 3× for 10 min in phosphate-buffered saline. Confocal microscopy was performed using a Bio-Rad MRC-1024 Hercules Laser Scanning Confocal Microscope equipped with a Kr/Ar laser. Equal volume whole plasma samples (5 μl) were loaded onto 10% polyacrylamide gels and electrophoretically transferred onto nylon membranes. The membranes were either stained with Coomassie Blue to visualize total protein or used to detect human AGT protein. For human AGT protein detection, the membrane was probed with 1:1000 dilution of primary rabbit anti-human AGT and detected with colorimetric assay utilizing horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary goat anti-rabbit antibody (ECL Western blotting analysis system, Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). Mouse and human AGT can be differentiated in the plasma on the basis of the strict species-specificity of the biochemical reaction between renin and AGT (22.Hatae T. Takimoto E. Murakami K. Fukamizu A. Mol. Cell. Biochem. 1994; 131: 43-47Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). Plasma samples were collected from mice immediately following CO2 asphyxiation. Approximately 500 μl of whole blood was collected at each bleed and placed in chilled tubes containing 2.5 μl of 0.5 mol/l EDTA. The specimens were then immediately centrifuged at 12,000 rpm for 10 min at 4 °C, and two 250-μl plasma samples were obtained and immediately frozen at −80 °C. Generation of Ang-I and radioimmunoassay was performed as described previously (21.Yang G. Merrill D.C. Thompson M.W. Robillard J.E. Sigmund C.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 32497-32502Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Radioimmunoassays were performed using the RIANEN Angiotensin I 125I-labeled RIA kit (DuPont Co., Billerica, MA) using the directions and reagents supplied by the manufacturer. Samples were appropriately diluted with reagent blank so that the radioimmunoassay results were on the linear portion of the standard curve. Plasma levels of AGT were then extrapolated using the 1:1 molar relationship between Ang-I and its precursor, AGT, using the formula: ng Ang-I/ml × 0.77 pmol/ng Ang-I × 0.05 μg hAGT/pmol. Blood pressure was measured in conscious, freely moving mice surgically instrumented with a left common carotid artery catheter (0.04 in outer diameter × 0.025 in inner diameter, Microrenathane; Braintree Science Inc., Braintree, MA) as described (23.Davisson R.L. Yang G. Beltz T.G. Cassell M.D. Johnson A.K. Sigmund C.D. Circ. Res. 1998; 83: 1047-1058Crossref PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar). The blood pressure response to infusions of purified recombinant human renin were made via a catheter implanted into the right jugular vein as described (24.Stec D.E. Davisson R.L. Haskell R.E. Davidson B.L. Sigmund C.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 21285-21290Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). Recombinant human renin was the kind gift of Drs. Walter Fischli and Klaus Lindpaintner at F. Hoffman-LaRoche, Basel Switzerland. To assess specificity of the response, mice were given captopril (20 mg/kg, intravenously) or a known pressor response dose of Ang-II (10 mg/kg) (25.Sinn P.L. Zhang X. Sigmund C.D. Am. J. Physiol. 1999; 277: F634-F642PubMed Google Scholar). To target the human AGT in a single copy upstream of the HPRT locus, we generated a targeting vector consisting of a segment of genomic DNA containing the complete human AGT coding sequence into the pMP8SKB vector (19.Bronson S.K. Plaehn E.G. Kluckman K.D. Hagaman J.R. Maeda N. Smithies O. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 9067-9072Crossref PubMed Scopus (258) Google Scholar). The targeting vector was transfected into BK4 cells, an HPRT-deficient E14Tg2a ES cell line. This cell line lacks the promoter and first two exons of HPRT, rendering it sensitive in HAT media. The targeting vector contains two regions of homology upstream and downstream of HPRT to facilitate recombination, the promoter and first two exons of HPRT missing in BK4 cells, and the human AGT gene (Fig. 1 A). Successful homologous recombination corrects HPRT deficiency, restoring the ability of BK4 cells to grow in HAT medium, and simultaneously inserts the human AGT gene upstream of the locus (Fig. 1, B andC). HAT-resistant colonies were first screened for the presence of the human AGT transgene using specific PCR primers (Fig.2 A) and second by Southern blot for the presence of a single integration event at the HPRT locus (Fig. 2 B). This approach was highly efficient in creating independently targeted ES clones (summarized in TableI).Figure 2ES cell targeting and development of transgenic mice. HAT-resistant ES cell clones were analyzed for the presence of the hAGT gene by PCR using hAGT-specific primer set (A) and by Southern blot using rsa probe (B). Note that clone 7 contains two insertions, one upstream of HPRT, and one at another undefined location in the genome. A cross between a male chimeric mouse with a high degree of chimerism, derived from clone 1, and three C57BL/6J females resulted in 15 offspring that were analyzed for the presence of the hAGT transgene by PCR (C) and for single copy integration at the HPRT locus by Southern blot (D).

The chimera with the highest degree of BK4 cell contribution was 100% efficient in transmitting the BK4 genome when mated with C57BL/6J mice, as judged by the agouti coat color of the offspring, whereas the other two failed to transmit the ES cell genome. Because BK4 ES cells are male cells and HPRT locus is located on the X chromosome, only female offspring from the initial cross could receive the human AGT transgene. Indeed, subsequent analysis of DNA from offspring by PCR (Fig. 2 C) and Southern blot (Fig. 2 D) confirmed the generation of only female transgenic mice. Upon establishing the hAGThprt transgenic line, we analyzed the tissue-specific expression of the transgene and compared it with a previously established multicopy human AGT transgenic mouse line generated by standard pronuclear injection (Fig.3) (21.Yang G. Merrill D.C. Thompson M.W. Robillard J.E. Sigmund C.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 32497-32502Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 26.Yang G. Sigmund C.D. Hypertension. 1998; 31: 734-740Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). Abundant human AGT mRNA was detected in liver and kidney of both the multicopy and hAGThprt transgenes, with lower levels detected in tissues such as heart, brain, white and brown adipose tissue, diaphragm, and aorta. Only minor anomalies were observed, including diminished expression in adrenal gland of both male and female hAGThprt mice and increased expression in kidney of male hAGThprt mice. These results strongly suggest that integration of the human AGT transgene upstream of the HPRT locus does not have a significant effect on its expression. Cell-specific expression of the human AGT protein was tested by immunohistochemistry in two of the most abundantly expressing tissues—liver and kidney. Fluorescent signals specific to human AGT protein expression were restricted to proximal tubule cells of the renal cortex (Fig. 4) and hepatocytes of the liver (Fig. 5). These are both well established sites of AGT expression indicating correct cell-specific expression of the transgene. It is interesting to note that, whereas male and homozygous female transgenic mice had uniformly high expression of human AGT throughout the liver, the expression pattern in heterozygous female transgenic mice was variegated. This likely reflects the functional random inactivation of genes located on the X-chromosome of female mice. A similarly variegated pattern was observed in the kidney. Our quantification of the level of hAGThprt mRNA in liver and kidney is also consistent with a pattern of random X-chromosome inactivation. The level of hepatic (Fig. 6 A) and renal (Fig. 6 B) hAGThprt mRNA in homozygous female transgenic mice was twice that of heterozygous female mice.Figure 5Cell-specific expression of human AGT in liver. Cell-specific expression of hAGT protein in liver of hAGThprt mice was analyzed by indirect immunohistochemistry, utilizing hAGT-specific antibody, in homozygous transgenic female mice (A), heterozygous transgenic female mice (B), nontransgenic female littermates (C), transgenic male mice (D), and nontransgenic male littermates (E).

Relative expression of human AGT mRNA was analyzed by RNase protection assay using mouse actin as an internal control and quantified as described under “Material and Methods.” Homozygous (+/+) female mice had about 2-fold higher expression in both liver (panel A, *, p = 0.011; n = 5) and kidney (panel B, *, p = 0.022;n = 5) as compared with heterozygous (+/−) transgenic female mice. C, analysis of plasma hAGT levels by measuring Ang-I (AI) conversion using radioimmunoassay similarly showed significantly decreased levels of hAGT protein in heterozygous transgenic female hAGThprt mice (n = 6) as compared with both transgenic male (*, p = 0.021;n = 6) and homozygous female mice (*, p= 0.021; n = 6).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Angiotensinogen expression is known to be regulated by androgens in kidney (27.Ellison K.E. Ingelfinger J.R. Pivor M. Dzau V.J. J. Clin. Invest. 1989; 83: 1941-1945Crossref PubMed Scopus (178) Google Scholar), and the level of human AGT mRNA in kidneys of male hAGThprt mice was higher than that of female mice (Fig. 3). This was examined in more detail in hAGThprt mice by measuring human AGT expression in kidney and liver following castration and subsequent administration of a subcutaneous pellet containing testosterone. Human AGT mRNA in kidney was reduced following castration, when compared with sham-operated control, and was restored to base-line levels by testosterone (Fig.7). As expected, expression of the transgene in liver was unaffected by the same protocol. We next determined if human AGT protein from hAGThprt mice is correctly processed in the liver and secreted into plasma. Similar to hepatic hAGThprt mRNA, the levels of circulating human AGT, as detected by its conversion to Ang-I in the presence of exogenous human renin, was equivalent in hemizygous male and homozygous female transgenic mice and about twice that of heterozygous female mice (Fig. 6 C). Western blot analysis indicated the characteristic banding pattern of human AGT protein with an approximate size of 50 kDa (Fig. 8), suggesting the protein was appropriately processed and released into the systemic circulation. We previously demonstrated that unlike most transgenes, expression of the human AGT gene in transgenic mice was proportional to copy number (26.Yang G. Sigmund C.D. Hypertension. 1998; 31: 734-740Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). Indeed, the level of circulating human AGT in the hAGThprt mice was substantially lower than that observed in a standard multicopy transgenic mouse (Fig. 8 B). This is particularly important as our ability to make direct comparison among allelic constructs using this method will require near physiologic levels of the transgene products. Because of species-specificity in renin-angiotensinogen enzymatic reaction, human AGT protein is essentially inert in the plasma of a mouse. Therefore, to formally prove the physiologic activity of human AGT present in the circulation, we measured blood pressure responses to acute intravenous infusion of purified recombinant human renin. Administration of 500 ng of human renin induced an acute increase in blood pressure (ΔBP = 25.6 ± 2.0 mmHg,n = 6) in hAGThprt mice (Fig.9 A). This pressor response could be repeatedly observed by additional infusion cycles (data not shown). That this was mediated by the cleavage of human AGT by human renin was proven by the abrogation of the pressor response after administration of captopril, an inhibitor of angiotensin-converting enzyme (Fig. 9 B). Even after captopril treatment, these mice responded with a pressor response to direct infusion of purified Ang-II (ΔBP = 38.6 ± 4.4 mmHg, n = 7, Fig. 9 C). It is important to note that the pressor response in the hAGThprt mice to human renin was significantly less than that caused by Ang-II infusion, again suggesting that the levels of human AGT in the circulation were in the physiologic range. We selectively targeted the human AGT gene to the mouse HPRT locus by employing ES cells harboring a deletion in the endogenous HPRT gene and a special targeting vector capable of restoring its full functionality upon homologous recombination (19.Bronson S.K. Plaehn E.G. Kluckman K.D. Hagaman J.R. Maeda N. Smithies O. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 9067-9072Crossref PubMed Scopus (258) Google Scholar, 28.Thompson S. Clarke A.R. Pow A.M. Hooper M.L. Melton D.W. Cell. 1989; 56: 313-321Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (309) Google Scholar). The use of gene targeting is essential in developing a model for studying effects of allelic gene variants in vivo because it nullifies the copy number and positional effects associated with transgene expression in transgenic mouse models generated by pronuclear injection. It allows reproducible insertion of the single copy of a transgene in a predetermined locus, permitting direct comparison between individually generated transgenic lines. Furthermore, independently derived transgenic mice generated by gene targeting are genetically identical, abolishing the need for multiple transgenic mouse lines harboring the same construct. The largest benefit of our strategy is the highly reproducible efficiency in selecting single homologous recombination events. This should allow for relatively easy development of a number of transgenic ES cell clones that harbor specific variants of a gene of interest, and a subsequent generation of transgenic mice. Of course, we must recognize certain drawbacks of using a nonnative locus, such as HPRT, for gene targeting. Exogenous genes may not harbor all of the sequences necessary and sufficient for proper regulation of expression and may therefore be influenced by cis-acting regulatory elements in the vicinity of the HPRT gene. Although the HPRT gene is essentially ubiquitously expressed, three studies reported preferential expression of certain transgenes in some but not other tissues (19.Bronson S.K. Plaehn E.G. Kluckman K.D. Hagaman J.R. Maeda N. Smithies O. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 9067-9072Crossref PubMed Scopus (258) Google Scholar, 29.Hatada S. Kuziel W. Smithies O. Maeda N. J. Biol.

Transgenic Res. 1993; 2: 1-13Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). However, two of those studies used a different methodology in their targeting by employing the neomycin resistance gene and G418 selection. Moreover, while transgene expression in the animals was studied in two reports, the third utilized teratocarcinoma cells derived from targeted ES cells. In addition, it is possible that the transgenes in those studies lacked all of the elements required for their normal expression. Our previous studies indicate that the 13.8-kb genomic human AGT transgene, identical to the one used in this study, is expressed in a tissue- and cell-specific and copy-number proportional fashion in transgenic mice, suggesting that all essential regulatory elements are present in the transgene (26.Yang G. Sigmund C.D. Hypertension. 1998; 31: 734-740Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). Another difference is that the transgene in our model is transcribed in the reverse orientation relative to the endogenous HPRT locus, which has been shown to have a beneficial effect on the expression of a transgene (30.Shaw-White J.R. Denko N. Albers L. Doetschman T.C. Stringer J.R. Transgenic Res. 1993; 2: 1-13Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). Another potential drawback of targeting the HPRT locus is that it is located on the X chromosome and the transgene expression is affected by random X inactivation, as we have demonstrated in our mice. This means that one can effectively achieve an equivalent of 1 copy (in the case of male and homozygous transgenic female mice) or 0.5 copy (in the case of heterozygous transgenic female mice) transgene expression. This should not be of a great concern in employing such mice in the analysis of transgene variants as long as it is considered in the final data analysis. For example, one could compare two or more lines of mice transgenic for different gene variants and could stratify the data according to mouse gender and/or zygosity. In fact, it is conceivable that lower levels of transgene expression might be beneficial in identifying modest molecular and physiologic changes between specific allelic variants. Our data indicate that the human AGT gene was apparently unaffected by the HPRT locus. It exhibited correct tissue and cell specificity and was properly regulated by the changes in testosterone levels. Furthermore, the human AGT protein was normally processed, and its plasma concentration was proportional to the level of human AGT mRNA indicating proper regulation. The protein in plasma is readily cleaved by human renin, resulting in the acute pressor response which could be easily detected by changes in blood pressure. We also showed that we are capable of detecting relatively small differences in expression levels of both RNA and protein, comparable with the proposed differences among −6G/235Met and −6A/235Thr alleles (31.Morgan T. Craven C. Nelson L. Lalouel J.M. Ward K. J. Clin. Invest. 1997; 100: 1406-1415Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar).

We present structures of human estrogenic 17β-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase (17β-HSD1) complexes with dehydroepiandrosterone (DHEA) and dihydrotestosterone (DHT), providing the first pictures to date of DHEA and DHT bound to a protein. Comparisons of these structures with that of the enzyme complexed with the most potent estrogen, estradiol, revealed the structural basis and general model for sex hormone recognition and discrimination. Although the binding cavity is almost entirely composed of hydrophobic residues that can make only nonspecific interactions, the arrangement of residues is highly complementary to that of the estrogenic substrate. Relatively small changes in the shape of the steroid hormone can significantly affect the binding affinity and specificity. TheK m of estrone is more than 1000-fold lower than that of DHEA and the K m of estradiol is about 10 times lower than that of DHT. The structures suggest that Leu-149 is the primary contributor to the discrimination of C-19 steroids and estrogens by 17β-HSD1. The critical role of Leu-149 has been well confirmed by site-directed mutagenesis experiments, as the Leu-149 → Val variant showed a significantly decreased K m for C-19 steroids while losing discrimination between estrogens and C-19 steroids. The electron density of DHEA also revealed a distortion of its 17-ketone toward a β-oriented form, which approaches the transition-state conformation for DHEA reduction.

Steroid hormones follow a common pathway; they diffuse into cells and bind to their receptors, which in turn bind hormone response elements to the DNA and interact with the transcriptional machinery to activate or repress transcription of target genes (1.Milgrom E. Baulieu E.E. Kelly P.A. Hormones From Molecules to Disease. Hermann, New York1990: 405-420Google Scholar, 2.Fawell S.E. Lees J.A. White R. Parker M.G. Cell. 1990; 60: 953-962Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (486) Google Scholar). One important mechanism by which cells can modify hormone action is the modulation of the steroid structure itself (3.Andersson S. J. Endocrinol. 1995; 146: 197-200Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). Steroid hormones share a very similar structure that has as its core the cyclo-pentenophenanthrene ring. The addition of an 18th carbon atom results in the estrogen ring (C-18), the addition of a 19th carbon atom results in the C-19 ring (including androgens such as DHT1 and testosterone), and the addition of a two-carbon lateral chain produces the pregnane ring (C-21). Despite their very similar structures, steroid hormones have significantly different physiological activities. DHT, the most potent androgen, estradiol (E2), the most potent estrogen, and DHEA, the most abundant hormone precursor in humans and other mammals, exert numerous and diverse actions on their target tissues (Fig. 1) (4.Thomas D.B. Cancer. 1984; 53: 595-601Crossref PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar, 5.Shealy C.N. Integr. Physiol. Behav. Sci. 1995; 30: 308-313Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar, 6.Griffiths K. Morton M.S. Nicholson R.I. Eur. Urol. 1997; 32: 24-40PubMed Google Scholar). The detailed mechanism of steroid discrimination has not been well elucidated up to now. The enzymes of the 17β-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase (17β-HSD) family are responsible for the last step in the formation of all androgens and estrogens. The reduction of the 17-ketone to a 17β-hydroxyl increases the affinity of the steroids to their cognate receptors (7.Peltoketo H. Lsomaa V. Poutanen M. Vihko R. J. Endocrinol. 1996; 150 suppl.: S21-S30PubMed Google Scholar). The 17β-reduction activity of these enzymes is thus required for the synthesis of all active androgens and estrogens. Molecular cloning has revealed the presence of seven isozymes of 17β-HSD, six of which are members of the short chain dehydrogenase/reductase superfamily (8.Persson B. Krook M. Jornvall H. Eur. J. Biochem. 1991; 200: 537-543Crossref PubMed Scopus (411) Google Scholar, 9.Nokelainen P. Peltoketo H. Vihko R. Vihko P. Mol. Endocrinol. 1998; 12: 1048-1059Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). 17β-HSD1 primarily catalyzes the interconversion of estrone (E1) and estradiol, but it also has some catalytic activity for the interconversion between DHEA and 5-androstene-3,17-diol, 4-androgene-3,17-dione and testosterone, as well as between A-dione and DHT (9.Nokelainen P.

We have previously proved that 17β-HSD1 is a dimer consisting of two identical subunits (11.Lin S.-X. Yang F. Jin J.Z. Breton R. Zhu D.W. Luu-The V. Labrie F. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 16182-16187Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Immunochemical analyses have confirmed the presence of this enzyme in human placenta, breast, and ovary granulosa cells (12.Luu-The V. Labrie C. Simard J. Lachance Y. Zhao H.F. Conët J. Leblanc G.

Since it is well known that estradiol stimulates the proliferation of mammary tumor cells, this enzyme is an important target for breast cancer therapy (14.Lippman M.E. Breast Cancer Res. Treat. 1986; 7: 59-70Crossref PubMed Scopus (231) Google Scholar, 15.Labrie F. Luu-The V. Lin S.-X. Labrie C. Simard J. Breton R. Belanger A. Steroids. 1997; 62 (0): 148-158Crossref PubMed Scopus (421) Google Scholar). The structure of 17β-HSD1 from human placenta was first determined at 2.2 Å resolution (16.Ghosh D. Pletnev V.Z. Zhu D.W. Wawrzak Z. Duax W.L. Pangborn W. Labrie F. Lin S.-X. Structure. 1995; 3: 503-513Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (257) Google Scholar). More recently, the structure of the complex of 17β-HSD1 with E2, as well as the enzyme structure in the presence of E2 and NADP, have been reported (17.Azzi A. Rehse P. Zhu D.W. Campbell R. Labrie F.

Structure. 1996; 4: 905-915Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (191) Google Scholar). Nevertheless, it is still unclear why a small structural modification, like the addition of a C-19 methyl group, can result in a very different catalytic activity, and how steroids are recognized by different isozymes and receptors. To answer these questions, we have determined and compared the structures of 17β-HSD1 in complex with different steroids. Here we report the crystal structures of 17β-HSD1 complexed with either DHEA or DHT. The comparison of the structures of DHEA, DHT, and E2 complexes with 17β-HSD1 gives an informative picture of important steroid hormone recognition and discrimination by the enzyme. DHEA, DHT, 17β-estradiol, and estrone were purchased from Aldrich. NAD, NADH, β-octylglucoside, dithiothreitol, polyethylene glycol 4000, and glycerol were from Sigma. We packed the Q-Sepharose ion exchange and the Blue-Sepharose CL-6B columns ourselves with media and columns from Amersham Pharmacia Biotech (Montreal, Canada). Phenyl-Superose HR 10/10 was purchased directly from the same company. All reagents were of the best grade available.Spodoptera frugiperda cells (Sf9 cells), Bac-N-BlueTM transfection kit, and transfer vector pBlueBac4.5 were purchased from Invitrogen Corp.; Grace's insect cell culture medium, yeastolate, and lactalbumin hydrolysate were from Life Technologies, Inc.; cell culture grade fetal bovine serum was from HyClone. 17β-HSD1 was purified from human placenta with a previously described rapid purification procedure (11.Lin S.-X. Yang F. Jin J.Z. Breton R. Zhu D.W. Luu-The V. Labrie F. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 16182-16187Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The crystallization was carried out with the vapor-diffusion technique in hanging drops. Crystals were obtained in several days with 30% polyethylene glycol 4000, 0.06% (w/v) β-octylglucoside, 0.12 m MgCl2, 0.1m Hepes, pH 7.5, and in the presence of saturating DHEA or DHT (1 mm). In the absence of glycerol, 17β-HSD1 gets inactivated readily at low temperature (at less than 10–15 °C), and it gets reactivated by warming at 30 °C where the enzyme is stable (29.Jarabak J. Seeds A.E. Talalay P. Biochemistry. 1996; 5: 1269-1278Crossref Scopus (105) Google Scholar). The enzyme stability is necessary for obtaining high quality crystals with a high occupancy of substrate. We thus attempted the crystallization at 27 °C, which yielded good results. 2Q. Han and S.-X. Lin, unpublished results. The data for the DHEA complex was collected on an R-axis IIC image plate area detector on a Rigaku RU-H2R rotating anode generator equipped with a graphite monochromator and a 0.5-mm collimator at room temperature. Data for the DHT complex were collected at −150 °C at beamline X12-C at Brookhaven National Laboratory. The two data sets were processed using DENZO and SCALEPACK (30.Otwinowski Z. Minor W. Carter C.W. Sweet R.M. Methods in Enzymology: Processing of X-ray Diffraction Data Collected in Oscillation Mode. 76. Academic Press, New York1996Google Scholar, 36). Both data sets were isomorphous with the native and E2 complex structures and were refined with X-Plor (31.Brünger A.T. X-PLOR, Version 3.1 Manual. Yale University Press, New Haven, CT1992Google Scholar) using the protein portion of the structure of the E2 complex as a starting point. Model building was done using the program O (32.Jones T.A. Zou J.Y. Cowan S.W. Kjeldgaard M. Acta Crystallogr. A. 1991; 47: 110-119Crossref PubMed Scopus (13014) Google Scholar). The refinement was begun with data between 10 and 3 Å resolution and subsequently was extended to the high resolution limit of each data set. Both structures were refined with good geometry (TableI). The electron densities for DHEA and DHT are well defined, and they have been modeled and refined with full occupancies. The electron densities for the 43 C-terminal residues and for the flexible segment between residues 192 and 207 are stronger than those found in the first enzyme structure and in the estradiol complex (17.Azzi A. Rehse P. Zhu D.W. Campbell R. Labrie F. Lin S.-X. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1996; 3: 665-668Crossref PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar), but they are still not clear enough to define the atomic location of those residues (15% of the protein by molecular mass). These missing portions of the model may contribute to the somewhat high freeR factor for the structure of the DHT complex.Table IData processing, structural, and refinement statistics17β-HSD-DHEA17β-HSD-DHTResolution (Å)2.32.24Total reflections25,46239,772Unique reflections (all data)14,31614,692Redundancy1.82.7Completeness (%)9597R sym (%)93.8Resolution (Å)8–2.38–2.24R/R free0.184/0.2490.189/0.278Atoms (protein/water)2179/402179/44Root-mean-square deviation: Bond distance (Å)0.0080.010 Bond angle (Å)1.381.46 Estimated average coordinate error (Å; see Ref.33.Luzzati V.

The reaction mixture contained 50 mm phosphate buffer, pH 7.5, 100 μm NADP(H), and 10–60 μm steroid (with smaller upper concentrations for estrogens: 10–30 μm for estradiol and 1–10 μm for estrone). The cell subfractions obtained from the wild type, and from the variants, were sonicated and centrifuged at 100,000 × g for 0.5 h to separate the mitochondrial and microsomal fractions resulting in samples ready for assaying the enzyme activity for various steroids. Lineweaver-Burk plots were used to determine the K mand V max values. A blank value lacking steroids was obtained under the same condition and subtracted. Protein concentrations were determined by the method of Bradford (26.Bradford M.M. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 72: 248-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (217544) Google Scholar). Protein content was rapidly assayed using a Coomassie Blue dye-binding procedure combined with scanning densitometry (27.Ghosh S. Gepstein S. Heikkila J.J. Dumbroff E.B. Anal.

The mutation to obtain the variant L149V, was constructed by using the QuickChange site-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene) following the manufacturer's instructions. The mutation used two primers: 5′-GGAGGATTGATGGGGGTGCCTTTCAATGACG-3′ and 5′-CGTCATTGAAAGGCACCCCCATCAATCCTCC-3′. After verifying the mutation by dideoxynucleotide sequencing, the mutated transfer vector was cotransfected in Sf9 cells with linearized pBlueBac DNA following the protocol described by the manufacturer (35.Invitrogen Corp Bac-N-BlueTM Transfection Kit Manual, version F. Invitrogen Corp., Carlsbad, CA1997Google Scholar). Sf9 cells were grown as monolayers at 27 °C in Grace's insect cell culture medium containing 10% fetal calf serum and 10 μg/ml gentamycin. Cells were infected with virus at a multiplicity of infection of 0.1–0.5 for virus amplification, and at a multiplicity of infection of 5–10 for protein expression. Cells were harvested 72 h after infection, washed with phosphate-buffered saline, pelleted in aliquots (1 × 107), and stored at −80 °C for later use. In these complexes, the core of the protein maintains the same structure as that of the enzyme (16.Ghosh D. Pletnev V.Z. Zhu D.W. Wawrzak Z. Duax W.L. Pangborn W. Labrie F. Lin S.-X.

Nat. Struct. Biol. 1996; 3: 665-668Crossref PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar). The quality of the electron density map for both DHEA and DHT enabled the unambiguous localization of their positions. Both DHEA and DHT, like E2, are deeply engulfed in the hydrophobic cleft (Fig.2) that is located at the interface of helices αG′ (209–227), αH (274–284), and αH′ (251–271). This cavity is composed of valines 143 and 225, leucine 149, phenylalanines 226 and 259, glycine 186, methionines 193 and 279, glutamic acid 282, tyrosine 218, serines 142 and 222, proline 187, and histidine 221. The binding pocket is approximately 7.5 Å by 9 Å in cross-section and 16 Å deep. Hydrophobic atoms constitute 79% of the total 335 Å2 surface of the pocket. It also contains the Tyr-X-X-X-Lys sequence that is conserved in all members of the short chain dehydrogenase/reductase superfamily and essential for the enzymatic activity. The O-17 atom of DHEA (and that of DHT) forms two hydrogen bonds with the protein. These hydrogen bonds involve Tyr-155 and Ser-142 in the active site, and form a triangular-shaped network similar to that observed between the steroid and the catalytic residues in the 17β-HSD-E2 complex. The O-3 atom in DHEA forms two hydrogen bonds with N-ε2 of His-221 and O-ε2 of Glu-282. The hydrogen bond between Glu-282 and O-3 is weak, as shown by the flexibility of the side chain of Glu-282, which has a high B-factor and a weak electron density. The hydrogen bond formed with His-221 is strong and important for orientating the bound substrate. The latter hydrogen bond is also found in the 17β-HSD1-DHT complex, and a similar hydrogen bond is found in the complex of rat liver 3α-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase with testosterone (19.Bennett M.J. Albert R.H. Jez J.M. Ma H. Penning T.M. Lewis M. Structure. 1997; 5: 799-812Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar). When the structures of the three substrate complexes of 17β-HSD1 are superimposed, it is found that the core of DHEA rotates by nearly 20° about an axis along the length of the steroid binding pocket, and shifts 1.5 Å at the O-3 end and 0.6 Å at the O-17 end as compared with the position of E2 in the E2 complex (Figs. 3 and4). DHT shifts 1.4 Å at the O-3 end and 0.6 Å at the O-17 end, but the core of DHT rotates only slightly. These results are surprising, since it was thought that the binding pocket fitted the steroid tightly (16.Ghosh D. Pletnev V.Z. Zhu D.W. Wawrzak Z. Duax W.L. Pangborn W. Labrie F. Lin S.-X. Structure. 1995; 3: 503-513Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (257) Google Scholar). In all structures of DHEA, DHT, and E2, the C-10 is in a precise alignment with the fork-like side chain of Leu-149. In the E2 structure, the distance between E2 and the Cδ of Leu-149 is 4.6 Å. Because there is a β-methyl C-19 attached to C-10 of DHEA and DHT, these steroids obviously cannot remain at the same position due to steric hindrance. The position of Leu-149 is stabilized by two main chain hydrogen bonds with Pro-150 O and Gly-148 O. The electron density of Leu-149 is well defined, and the B-factors of its Cδ1 and Cδ2 are half the average B-factor for the whole protein. The interaction of Leu-149 with both DHEA and DHT is sufficiently strong to shift Cδ1 and Cδ2 of Leu-149 by 0.4 Å from their original position in the presence of E2. This rigidity of part of the active site forces the shift in position of DHEA and DHT. Compared with E2 binding, the different binding locations of DHT and DHEA result in reduced interactions of these steroids with several important non-polar residues in the binding pocket, although they can make new interactions with the more polar Ser-222 and Pro-187. The E2 complex structure and our modeling study 3B. Zhorov and S.-X. Lin, unpublished results. have revealed that Phe-259 plays an important part in E2 binding. Its side chain forms five van der Waals contacts with the A-ring of E2. Because the interactions with DHEA and DHT are decreased, we observed that the side chain of Phe-259 in the DHEA and DHT complexes has shifted a little from its binding position in the E2 complex and that its B-factor has increased. Due to the hydrophobic nature of steroids, van der Waals contacts between 17β-HSD1 and the non-polar atoms of the steroid provide major contributions to the binding energy. A loss of favorable interactions would be expected to decrease the affinity of binding. The reason for the difference between the binding positions of DHEA and of DHT may be explained by the differences in their shapes. The A- and B-rings of DHT are in the same plane while the double bond between C-5 and C-6 in DHEA forces the C-3 and 3-hydroxyl group toward the α surface. DHT makes stronger interactions with Val-283 and Tyr-218 than DHEA, while DHEA makes stronger interactions with Glu-282 and a stronger hydrogen bond with N-ε2 of His-221. The positions of most of the active site residues are unchanged, but the helix-turn-helix motif (αG“-αG′) (16.Ghosh D. Pletnev V.Z. Zhu D.W. Wawrzak Z. Duax W.L. Pangborn W. Labrie F. Lin S.-X. Structure. 1995; 3: 503-513Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (257) Google Scholar) has conformational mobility that allows different positions for His-221 and Phe-226 in the presence of various ligands (Fig. 3). The flexibility of helix αG′, which contains several residues in the binding pocket, may be important for steroid binding.Figure 4An expanded view of the superposition of DHEA, DHT , and E2 from another direction. The 17-hydroxyl or 17-ketone in those steroids are closer to each other than the 3-hydroxyl or 3-ketone. The bound positions of DHEA and DHT are more similar to each other than they are to the bound position of E2.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Evidence for the relative binding affinities of various substrates can be obtained from the steroid electron density in the different complex structures. The position of E2 in the binding pocket was proven by its high level of electron density. In contrast, the electron densities of DHEA and DHT are weaker than that of E2 in the cognate complex, although they were crystallized in the presence of higher concentrations of DHEA and DHT (about 1 mm) than the one that was used in the cocrystallization of E2 (500 μm) (17.Azzi A. Rehse P. Zhu D.W. Campbell R. Labrie F. Lin S.-X. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1996; 3: 665-668Crossref PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar). The slightly higher B factor values of the DHEA and DHT complexes also show that their positions are less well defined than was E2 in the binding pocket. Steady-state kinetic studies of these steroids with 17β-HSD1 were carried out in parallel, to compare with the structural information from various complexes. These kinetic studies show that theK m for DHEA is more than 1000-fold greater than that for estrone, and the K m value for DHT is about 10-fold greater than that for estradiol, in agreement with the structural information (Table II).Table IISteady-state kinetic parameters of 17β-HSD1 with different substratesLigandsWild type 17β-HSD1L149V variantK mk catk cat/K mK mK catk cat/K mμms −1μms −1Estrone0.035.81940.30.260.87Estradiol4.64.40.98100.240.024DHEA330.330.014.30.340.079DHT450.160.003517.20.120.007The K m and k cat for each case represent a mean value of two experiments.

Reference values ofK m and k cat for estrogens with wild type 17β-HSD1 were from Footnote 4. The catalytic mechanism of 17β-HSD1 for estrone reduction is thought to involve the direct transfer of a hydride ion from the C-4 position of the nicotinamide nucleotide to the acceptor carbonyl C-17 of estrone to produce a 17β-hydroxyl. The NADP+ molecule binds in an extended conformation, with the nicotinamide moiety in a synconformation pointing toward the substrate binding site of 17β-HSD1 (17.Azzi A. Rehse P. Zhu D.W. Campbell R. Labrie F. Lin S.-X. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1996; 3: 665-668Crossref PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar, 20.Mazza C. Breton R. Housset D. Fontecilla-Camps J. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 8145-8152Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). The shift of DHT and DHEA could increase the distance between C-17 of the steroid and C-4 of the nicotinamide. A modeling study using the model from Azzi et al. (17.Azzi A. Rehse P. Zhu D.W. Campbell R. Labrie F. Lin S.-X. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1996; 3: 665-668Crossref PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar) and the NADP+model from Breton et al. (18.Breton R. Housset D. Mazza C. Fontecilla-Camps J. Structure. 1996; 4: 905-915Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (191) Google Scholar) indicated that the distance is 3.6 Å for E2, 4.0 Å for DHT, and 3.9 Å for DHEA. If these longer distances are maintained when 17β-HSD1 binds both the cofactor and these substrates, then we would expect a lower rate of hydride transfer for the C-19 steroids. Thus, we propose that the weak affinity of DHEA and DHT for 17β-HSD1 is consistent with their increased K m values and that the longer distance between C-17 and C-4 of NADP+ is in accord with their lowerk cat values when compared with E2. As a result of the K m andk cat modification, the specificity difference between the estrogens and C-19 steroids could be between 250- and 50,000- fold. The discrimination between these steroids is thus guaranteed. Of all the steroid hormones, only the estrogens E1 and E2 lack the C-19 methyl group. 17β-HSD1 is well designed for its high specificity toward estrogen hormones. Although the binding cavity is almost entirely composed of hydrophobic residues having nonspecific interactions, the arrangement of residues yields highly specific interactions allowing only one orientation for the steroid, corresponding to the strongest binding. Thus, relatively small changes in the shape of the hormones can significantly affect the binding position and affinity resulting in critical hormone recognition and substrate selectivity. The interactions between C-19 and the hydrophobic side chains around Leu-149 appear to be the most important for discriminating C-19 steroids and in preventing them from binding in an ideal position. Therefore, the shape of the binding pocket plays a critical role in steroid hormone discrimination. In parallel with the crystallographic study, site-directed mutagenesis was carried out to produce the variant by replacing the Leu-149 by the very similar but smaller valine. As expected from our knowledge of the structure, the catalytic efficiency and substrate discrimination were significantly modified in the variant, which, unlike the native enzyme, demonstrates similar affinities for E2 and DHEA. TheK m of variant enzyme for DHEA has decreased from 33 μm to 4.3 μm, while theK m for E1 has increased from 0.03 μm to 0.3 μm (Table II). Similarly, the variant enzyme showed a lower K m value for DHT as compared with the wild type, though the effect is not so significant as in the case of DHEA (Table II). These changes appear to be due to some loss of favorable interactions with estrogens and to the removal of unfavorable interactions with C-19 steroids and thus are in good agreement with the above structural analysis. In Table II, we can see that the specificity values of the Leu-149 → Val variant for estrogens may decrease, while these values significantly increased for C-19 steroids, resulting in a loss of C-18/C-19 steroid discrimination. In fact, the specificity value for C-19 steroids and estrogens became similar (Table II). These results confirm the crucial role of the Leu-149 in the substrate recognition of 17β-HSD1. The structure of 17β-HSD1 complexed with DHEA gives important information about how the enzyme catalyzes the conversion of the 17-ketone to the 17β-hydroxyl. The omit difference electron density map shows that the C-17 ketone oxygen is oriented toward the β-position. The refinement was started with an energy-minimized DHEA model created with Insight II (Biosym, Inc.), in which thed-ring conformation position and O-17 are oriented toward the α-face of the steroid. This conformation is likely favored by the presence of the C-18 methyl group. However, the d-ring and O-17 did not fit into the electron density and O-17 was far from a position in which it could form hydrogen bonds with Tyr-155 (4.8 Å) and Ser-142 (4.4 Å). Small molecule structures of DHEA demonstrate a greater degree of flexibility of the d-ring compared with the rest of the steroid core (21.Caira M.R. Guillory J.K. Chang L.C. J. Chem. Crystallogr. 1995; 25: 393-400Crossref Scopus (16) Google Scholar). Therefore, the conformation of thed-ring was adjusted to fit the density (Fig.5). O-17, C-17, and C-16 were moved 1.2, 0.6, and 0.7 Å, respectively, toward the β-surface. The O-17–C-17 bond was shifted by 24° compared with its orientation in the energy-minimized and small molecular models. In this new conformation, the 17-ketone oxygen can form hydrogen bonds with Tyr-155 (3.6 Å) and Ser-142 (3.3 Å). This suggests that the hydroxyl groups of Tyr-155 and Ser-142 can induce the new position of the 17-ketone oxygen of DHEA, thereby allowing Tyr-155 to donate its proton and to form a hydrogen bond. These hydrogen bonds could stabilize this high energy state, thus facilitating the proton transfer from Tyr-155 to O-17, and the hydride transfer from nicotinamide ring to C-17 of the steroid. The presence of the positively charged side chain of Lys-159, in proximity to the Tyr-155 hydroxyl oxygen, could also facilitate the stabilization of the β-oriented ketone and proton transfer. By comparison, in the structure of the E2 complex, the 17-hydroxyl andd-ring of estradiol are β-oriented, forming strong hydrogen bonds with Tyr-155 and Ser-142. Thus, the β-oriented ketone shows the characteristics of the intermediate of 17β-HSD reduction, and this is evidence for enzyme-induced strain of the substrate. The stabilization of a β-oriented ketone is an obligatory step in the formation of the 17β-hydroxyl, because it decreases the energy barrier for the conversion of 17-ketone to 17β-hydroxyl. Therefore, the present results may indicate a new catalytic mechanism that includes a conformational modification during the reduction of DHEA, and this may also apply to the reduction of other 17-keto-steroid hormones (Fig. 6).Figure 6A side-by-side comparison of D-ring conformations. The normal model of DHEA (right) is the energy-minimized structure, which is very similar to the small molecule crystal structure of DHEA (21.Caira M.R. Guillory J.K. Chang L.C. J. Chem. Crystallogr. 1995; 25: 393-400Crossref Scopus (16) Google Scholar). The d-ring conformation of the model of 5-androstene-3,17-diol, the product of the reduction of DHEA (left), was made using Insight II by referring to the conformation of E2. The conformation of O-17 and thed-ring of DHEA changes from α-oriented toward an β-oriented position during the reduction reaction. The strained model of DHEA is also shown (center).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) The present structure and kinetic studies of inhibitors have determined that a 17β-hydroxyl or 17-ketone in the ligand is essential for tight binding with 17β-HSD1 (24.Penning T.M. Endocr. Relat. Cancer. 1996; 3: 41-56Crossref Scopus (80) Google Scholar). This is consistent with the formation of strong hydrogen bonds with Tyr-155 and Ser-142 as seen in the 17β-HSD1-E2 complex. Even though the orientations of the core of DHEA and DHT have been changed in the binding pocket, the hydrogen bonds to Tyr-155 have remained. Hydrogen bonds are highly directional and therefore are important in the determination of the binding orientation, while the non-directional van der Waals forces are important for the binding affinity of steroids. The three 17β-HSD1 binary complex structures shed light upon the general features of steroid hormone recognition by the 17β-HSD family. The steroid binding pocket appears to have three regions. The first region recognizes the steroid phenolic A-ring. It contains the conserved His-221 and Glu-282 residues that could form hydrogen bonds with O-3. The second region binds to the central hydrophobic core of the steroid. It contributes to the main thermodynamic force favoring the binding of substrates. The catalytic region surrounds the d-ring, and contains the absolutely conserved catalytic residue Tyr-155 that is located on the β-face of the steroid and forms a hydrogen bond with O-17. The α-face of the steroid is accessible to the nicotinamide to facilitate hydride transfer. Because both estrogens and androgens (with C-19) may have 3- and 17-hydroxyl or ketone groups, the critical residues that are expected to determine specificity for the estrogenic and androgenic members of the 17β-HSD family must lie within the hydrophobic binding region. In estrogen-specific enzymes, some residues will sterically hinder the C-19-methyl group of the androgens, resulting in an unfavorable binding position or no binding at all. In androgen-specific enzymes, such as 17β-HSD3, there may be a hydrophobic cavity that can strongly interact with the C-19. We predict that the hydrophobic region of 17β-HSD2 will be more tolerant than that of 17β-HSD1, as it shows similar activity with both C-18 and C-19 hormones. We propose that other C-19 steroids (androstenedione, androsterone, androst-5-ene-3β,17β-diol, and testosterone) must have similar interactions with 17β-HSD1 as do DHEA and DHT. This prediction is in agreement with our kinetic data, which show that these C-19 steroids have similar K m and K catvalues for 17β-HSD1.4 The combination of hydrogen bonding and hydrophobic interactions in the construction of the specific steroid binding site in 17β-HSD1 is expected to be a common feature in other protein-steroid interactions. Hydrogen bonds alone are insufficient for the requisite ligand-binding affinity; van der Waals contacts contribute significantly to binding energy. Similar mechanisms were recently shown in the interactions between the estrogen receptor and 17β-estradiol (22.Brzozowski A.M. Pike A.C. Dauter Z. Hubbard R.E. Bonn T. Engstrom O. Ohman L. Greene G.L. Gustafsson J.A. Carlquist M. Nature. 1997; 389: 753-758Crossref PubMed Scopus (2963) Google Scholar). Forty percent of all cancer cases are sex steroid-sensitive, including breast, prostate, ovarian, and uterine cancers. Steroid-metabolizing enzymes are thus prime candidates for approaches based on control of intracrine activity. Because the 17β-HSD isozymes have much greater tissue specificity than the receptor, this family of enzymes is an attractive target for the design of potent and selective drugs to combat steroid-related disorders (23.Duax W.L. Griffin J.F. Ghosh D. Curr. Opin. Struct. Biol. 1996; 6: 813-823Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar,24.Penning T.M. Endocr. Relat. Cancer. 1996; 3: 41-56Crossref Scopus (80) Google Scholar). The 17β-HSD1 complex structures suggest several ways to design potent inhibitors. The narrow hydrophobic binding region contributes the main thermodynamic force for binding. For the best access to the restricted pocket, a planar hydrophobic ring structure like that of E2 should be chosen as the core of an inhibitor. A β-oriented electron withdrawing group should be present to form hydrogen bonds with Tyr-155 and Ser-142. In addition, an α-oriented hydrophobic group at C-17 or C-16 would help to prevent the nicotinamide nucleotide cofactor from binding. Despite the narrowness of the hydrophobic cleft, there appears to be sufficient space to accommodate substituents at the 7α-position of the steroid. 17β-Estradiol derivatives with 7α-alkyl substituents have been synthesized and shown to inhibit 17β-HSD1 (25.Labrie C. Martel C. Dufour J.M. Levesque C. Merand Y. Labrie F. Cancer Res. 1992; 52: 610-615PubMed Google Scholar). The selectivity of an inhibitor toward androgenic or estrogenic HSDs would be controlled by the shape of its hydrophobic core. A group in the C-19 position of the androgen would greatly decrease its affinity toward 17β-HSD1 while increasing the affinity toward 17β-HSD3. We thank Dr. F. Labrie for his interest in this work.

Toxoplasma gondii is responsible for opportunistic infections in immunosuppressed individuals, in particular AIDS and transplant patients, and congenital infections in newborns. T. gondii is an obligate intracellular parasite that can survive and replicate inside many cell types, including activated macrophages. This suggests that the parasite has mechanisms to evade the macrophage respiratory burst (1.Murray H.W. Cohn Z.A. J. Exp. Med. 1979; 150: 938-949Crossref PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar). Previous studies have shown that the parasite is remarkably resistant to hydrogen peroxide and can quench released oxygen radicals (2.Chang H.R. Pechere J.C. Microb. Pathog. 1989; 7: 37-44Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). These phenomena are attributed to the high level expression of catalase and superoxide dismutase (3.Sibley L.D. Lawson R. Weidner E. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 1986; 19: 83-87Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar) and their ability to decompose H2O2. Despite their importance, no further effort has been made to characterize these enzymes in detail. Catalase (EC 1.11.1.6) is a marker enzyme of peroxisomes or microbodies. These subcellular organelles compartmentalize more than 50 different enzymes that intersect with a large variety of anabolic and metabolic pathways. In mammalian cells, these pathways include peroxide metabolism, β-oxidation of fatty acids, and ether phospholipid synthesis. Most peroxisomal enzymes are synthesized on free ribosomes and then post-translationally imported into peroxisomes through an evolutionarily conserved machinery (4.Gould S.J. Keller G.A. Hosken N. Wilkinson J. Subramani S. J. Cell Biol. 1989; 108: 1657-1664Crossref PubMed Scopus (889) Google Scholar). Several types of peroxisomal targeting signals (PTS)1 have been identified. PTS1, the C-terminal peroxisomal targeting signal, resides in the last 3 amino acids that share the following consensus motif: (S/T/A/G/C/N)-(R/K/H)-(L/I/V/M/A/F/Y) (PROSITE, Swiss Institute of Bioinformatics). However, not all combinations have been tested, and residues upstream of this signal are known to influence the recognition of this motif (5.Purdue P.E. Lazarow P.B. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 134: 849-862Crossref PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar). A well characterized example of microbodies in protozoan parasites are the glycosomes of the Kinetoplastidae, e.g. Leishmania and Trypanosoma (6.Opperdoes F.R. Baudhuin P. Coppens I. DeRoe C. Edwards S.W. Weijers P.J. Misset O. J. Cell Biol. 1984; 98: 1178-1184Crossref PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar). These organelles, most prominent in the bloodstream form of these parasites, notably compartmentalize glycolytic enzymes but surprisingly do not contain catalase. Protein import into glycosomes is thought to be mediated by a similar mechanism as reported for mammalian peroxisomal import. In the phylum Apicomplexa, however, peroxisomes or related particles have never been defined. In this study we report the cloning of T. gondii catalase, its subcellular localization in peroxisomes, and its targeting, mediated through a PTS1 signal. This is the first evidence for the existence of a peroxisomal compartment in any Apicomplexan parasite. The RH strain ofT. gondii was maintained by growth in monolayers of either African Green monkey (Vero) cells or human foreskin fibroblasts as described previously (7.Roos D.S. Donald R.G. Morissette N.S. Moulton A.L. Methods Cell Biol. 1994; 45: 27-63Crossref PubMed Scopus (511) Google Scholar). Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells were cultured in α-minimum Eagle's medium supplemented with 3.5% fetal bovine serum, 2 mm l-glutamine, and penicillin/streptomycin at 37 °C in 5% CO2 atmosphere. A catalase proximal heme-ligand signature (PROSITE, Swiss Institute of Bioinformatics) was found in two sequences of the EST data base of the Toxoplasma EST project (8.Ajioka J. Boothroyd J.C. Brunk B.P. Hehl A. Hillier L. Manger I.D. Overton G.C. Marra M. Roos D. Sibley L.D. Genome Res. 1998; 8: 18-28Crossref PubMed Scopus (163) Google Scholar). Both lambda phage clones (GenBankTM accession numbers W9973 and W6349) were obtained from Genome Systems (St. Louis, MO), in vivo excised with VCSM13 (Stratagene, Menasha, WI) as helper phage and sequenced. The upstream sequence was obtained by 5′-rapid amplification of cDNA ends (anchor primers: R1, R2, and R3 see TableI) and by RT-PCR with a degenerate primer (Fdeg) against a highly conserved motif in eukaryotic catalases and two specific reverse primers (R4 and R5). A second 5′- rapid amplification of cDNA ends (anchor primers: R6, R7, and R9) revealed the missing upstream region. The sequence was confirmed by RT-PCR with specific primers against the 5′- and 3′-untranslated regions (F4 and R0), and four independent clones were sequenced. For RT-PCR and rapid amplification of cDNA ends applications, RNA was isolated using TRIzol reagent and transcribed with Superscript II reverse transcriptase according to the manufacturer's instructions (Life Technologies, Inc.). DNA sequences were obtained by dideoxy sequencing of both strands at the W. M. Keck Sequencing Center, Yale University School of Medicine. The strategy for determining the nucleotide sequence of T. gondii catalase is shown in Fig.1.Table IPrimer 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 sequences used in this work are shown.

The nucleotide sequence that codes for the C-terminal part of T. gondii catalase (aa 335–502) was amplified by PCR (primers ExF and ExR) and cloned in frame into the BamHI andXmaI site of the pGEX-4T-1 expression vector (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). The resulting glutathione S-transferase (GST) fusion protein was expressed in the Escherichia colistrain DH5α. Synthesis of the GST fusion protein was induced with 0.5 mm isopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside for 4–6 h at 37 °C. The protein was solubilized withN-laurylsarcosine (9.Frangioni J.V. Neel B.G. Anal. Biochem. 1993; 210: 179-187Crossref PubMed Scopus (833) Google Scholar) and affinity purified on glutathione-Sepharose beads (Sigma). Rabbit preimmune sera were screened by immunoblot for low background recognition of T. gondii antigens, and a suitable animal was chosen. Immunization and antiserum production were carried out by Cocalico Biologicals (Reamstown, PA). About 5 × 106 parasites (or an equivalent amount of host cell material) were collected by centrifugation, separated on a 10% SDS-polyacrylamide gel, and transferred onto nitrocellulose membrane. The membranes were probed with a 1:500 dilution of anti-T. gondii catalase antiserum, followed by a 1:2000 dilution of horseradish peroxidase-conjugated anti-rabbit IgG antibody (Calbiochem). The signal was visualized with the ECL kit (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). As a control, incubation with preimmune serum at a 1:100 dilution was performed. The rabbit antiserum to T. gondii catalase was purified by adsorption to the 47-kDa band of the purified recombinant antigen on an immunoblot, as described previously (10.Beckers C.J. Dubremetz J.F. Mercereau-Puijalon O. Joiner K.A. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 127: 947-961Crossref PubMed Scopus (206) Google Scholar). Alternatively, the antiserum was affinity purified against the GST fusion protein coupled to cyanogen bromide-activated agarose (Sigma). The antibody was bound to the column in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS), pH 7.4, eluted with 0.2 mglycine, pH 2.8, and the pH of the eluate was immediately readjusted by adding 1 m Tris base. The immunofluorescence assay (IFA) for intracellular parasites was performed as described previously (11.Karsten V. Qi H. Beckers C.J. Joiner K.A. Methods. 1997; 13: 103-111Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar), using 3% paraformaldehyde as fixative. Extracellular parasites were fixed in ice-cold acetone for 15 min and then processed similarly. Controls included incubation with preimmune serum, secondary antibody alone, and competition experiments with the purified GST fusion protein. The following dilutions of antibodies were used: fluorescein isothiocyanate (FITC)-linked goat anti-rabbit IgG (Calbiochem) at 1:500; rhodamine-linked goat anti-mouse (Roche Molecular Biochemicals) at 1:500; affinity purified rabbit anti-catalase at 1:5; murine monoclonal anti-ROP2,3,4 (T3 4A7) at 1:250; murine monoclonal anti-GRA3 (T6 2H11) at 1:250; and murine monoclonal anti-MIC2 (D2R3) at 1:250. All monoclonal antibodies were generously provided by J. F. Dubremetz, Lille, France. The apicoplast was stained with 4′,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole (12.Fichera M.E. Roos D.S. Nature. 1997; 390: 407-409Crossref PubMed Scopus (504) Google Scholar). For IFA on CHO cells, the same protocol as for intracellular parasites was applied. Antibody concentrations used were as follows: rabbit anti-chloramphenicol acetyltransferase antibody (5 Prime → 3 Prime Inc., Boulder, CO) at 1:500; rabbit anti-catalase antiserum at 1:250,and rabbit anti-SKL antibody (Zymed Laboratories Inc., South San Francisco, CA) at 1:500. Diaminobenzidine (DAB) staining for catalase was performed according to established procedures (13.Deimann W. Angermüller S. Stoward P.J. Fahimi H.D. Stoward P.J. Everson Pearse A.G. Histochemistry. 3. Churchill Livingstone, Edinburgh, UK1991: 573-575Google Scholar). In brief, parasites were fixed for 15 min with 1.5% glutaraldehyde in 0.1m PIPES buffer, pH 7.4, washed once in PBS, pH 7.4, and one time in Teorell-Stenhagen buffer (T/S: 50 mm boric acid, 10 mm phosphoric acid, 2.5 mm citric acid brought to pH 10.5 by NaOH). Following a 1-h preincubation in DAB (2 mm in T/S) at room temperature, H2O2 was added to a final concentration of 0.15% for 1–3 h. After washing in T/S and 100 mm sodium cacodylate buffer, pH 7.4, the sample was fixed overnight with 2.5% glutaraldehyde in 100 mm sodium cacodylate at 4 °C and embedded in Epon (Electron Microscopy Sciences, Fort Washington, PA). Ultrathin 60–80 nm sections were mounted on Formvar-coated nickel grids (Electron Microscopy Sciences). The sections were not counterstained in order to facilitate recognition of the DAB precipitate. As a control, DAB incubations were done in the presence of 20 mm 3-amino-1,2,4-triazole or alternatively H2O2 was omitted. For light microscopy, the above procedure was performed on coverslips that were mounted and examined after the H2O2 incubation. Chloramphenicol acetyltransferase (CAT) and T. gondii catalase expression in CHO cells was driven by the cytomegalovirus promoter. CAT-AKM was ligated into the HindIII and KpnI site (CATFHind, CATAKMKpn) of pcDNA3.1/Zeo(+) (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA). For a cytosolic control, CAT in the pcDNA3.1/Zeo/CAT vector (Invitrogen) was used. T. gondii catalase was cloned into NheI and BamHI sites of pcDNA3.1/Zeo(+) using NheCat, AKMBgl (full-length catalase), and CYPBgl (C-terminal truncation) as primers. CHO cells were transfected using SuperFect (Qiagen, Valencia, CA), following the manufacturer's instructions. The cells were plated on coverslips 24–48 h after transfection, and IFA was performed 24 h later. The deduced amino acid sequence of T. gondii catalase encodes a protein of 502 residues with a predicted molecular mass of 57.2 kDa (Fig.2). Evaluation of the protein sequence by BLASTP (14.Altschul S.F. Madden T.L. Schäffer A.A. Zhang J. Zhang Z. Miller W. Lipman D.J. Nucleic Acids Res. 1997; 25: 3389-3402Crossref PubMed Scopus (60233) Google Scholar) shows a high degree of identity with other catalases (e.g. 53% identity with human catalase), whereas comparison of the T. gondii catalase nucleotide sequence with eukaryotic catalases reveals only minimal similarity. This suggests, along with additional data provided below (Fig. 4), that the deduced catalase sequence is derived from T. gondii and not from host cell contamination.Figure 4Immunoblot with antiserum against a GST-catalase fusion. Whole parasite lysates (from organisms grown in Vero cells) were probed by immunoblot with the antiserum to T. gondii catalase. A 63-kDa protein was detected in the parasite lysate (1st lane). No signal was observed in the negative control with lysates of uninfected Vero cells (2nd lane). The purified GST-catalase fusion protein serves as a positive control, migrating at the predicted size of 47 kDa (3rd lane).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Further analysis confirms that this protein is indeed a catalase. Foremost, both catalase consensus patterns (15.von Ossowski I. Hausner G. Loewen P.C. J. Mol. Evol. 1993; 37: 71-76Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar) are present: the active site signature at position 53–69 (consensus, (IF)X(RH)X 4(EQ)RX 2HX 2(GAS)-(GASTF)-(GAST)) and at position 343–351 the proximal heme ligand signature (consensus, R-(LIVMFSTAN)-F-(GASTNP)YXD(AST)-(QEH)) (Fig.3). Residues that comprise the active site are absolutely identical to human catalase (Phe-142, Phe-150, and Phe-53 as distal and His-207 and Arg-343 as proximal heme binding partners; Arg-61, Arg-101, and Arg-354 as binding partners for the propionate groups of the heme). Residues neighboring the active center are also conserved (Tyr-347, Asp-54, His-64, Val-135, and Phe-323), with minor alterations (S346A and L50M) in human catalase (16.Gouet P. Jouve H.-M. Dideberg O. J. Mol. Biol. 1995; 249: 933-954Crossref PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar). Residues that are thought to play a role in the catalytic mechanism are also conserved (His-64, Asn-137, Ser-103, and Tyr-347) (17.Loewen P. Gene (Amst.). 1996; 197: 39-44Crossref Scopus (43) Google Scholar). Some catalases, e.g. human or bovine catalase, are NADPH-containing enzymes (16.Gouet P. Jouve H.-M. Dideberg O. J. Mol. Biol. 1995; 249: 933-954Crossref PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar). NADPH is thought to prevent the formation of compound II, an inactive state in the catalytic cycle (18.Kirkman H.N. Rolfo M. Ferraris A.M. Gaetani G.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 13908-13914Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (219) Google Scholar). Sequence conservation suggests that T. gondii catalase may also bind NADPH as a cofactor. Residues possibly involved in NADPH binding (Arg-192, Thr-190, Asn-202, His-294, His-183, Gln-435, Trp-292, His-224, and Val-443) and residues in the environment of the putative NADPH-binding site (Glu-448, Phe-187, Thr-139, Pro-140, Tyr-204, Lys-226, Gln-271, Pro-293, Val-291, Phe-439, and Leu-444) are identical to the human sequence with the exception of Thr-190 and Glu-448 (16.Gouet P. Jouve H.-M. Dideberg O. J. Mol. Biol. 1995; 249: 933-954Crossref PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar). The substrate H2O2 is thought to diffuse to the active site through an approximately 30-Å long channel (16.Gouet P. Jouve H.-M. Dideberg O. J. Mol. Biol. 1995; 249: 933-954Crossref PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar). Residues that build the walls of the narrow part of this channel are identical to the human sequence (Val-105, Ala-106, Asp-117, Pro-118, Phe-142, Phe-143, Phe-150, Phe-153, Ile-154, Val-185, Leu-188, Gln-157, and Lys-158), suggesting that the range of potential substrates is similar (19.Zamocky M. Herzog C. Nykyri L.M. Koller F. FEBS Lett. 1995; 367: 241-245Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). Most catalases exist as homotetramers. Residues that are known to be involved in subunit interactions in Proteus mirabiliscatalase are identical with the corresponding residues in T. gondii catalase (Leu-50, Asp-54, Phe-53, Asp-349, Arg-55, P. mirabilis alignment not shown) (16.Gouet P. Jouve H.-M. Dideberg O. J. Mol. Biol. 1995; 249: 933-954Crossref PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar). Human and bovine catalases, which have a longer C terminus, also stabilize the subunit interactions with these additional amino acids. T. gondii catalase contains a putative peroxisomal targeting signal (PTS1) at the C terminus. The last three residues of the protein (-AKM) match the consensus motif of C-terminal peroxisomal targeting signals ((S/T/A/G/C/N)-(R/K/H)-(L/I/V/M/A/F/Y)). This motif has been shown to be a PTS1, albeit a weak one, when linked to CAT and expressed in monkey kidney (CV1) cells (20.Swinkels B.W. Gould S.J. Subramani S. FEBS Lett. 1992; 305: 133-136Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar). Antiserum was raised to a fusion protein between GST and residues 335–502 ofT. gondii catalase. This region of T. gondiicatalase is comparatively divergent to human catalase and was therefore chosen as antigen. As expected the antiserum recognizes the recombinant GST-catalase fusion protein migrating at 47 kDa (Fig.4, 3rd lane). This antiserum recognizes a single band on immunoblot, when tested against whole parasites (Fig. 4, 1st lane). This protein migrates at 63 kDa, which is in reasonable agreement with the predicted size (57.2 kDa) of T. gondii catalase. The parasite protein expressed in CHO cells also migrates with the sameM r (data not shown). No signal is observed with uninfected host cells (Fig. 4, 2nd lane) or with preimmune serum (data not shown), indicating that the band constitutes a T. gondii protein. Anti-catalase antiserum recognizes a punctate, beaded structure anterior to the nucleus by immunofluorescence (Fig.5). Additionally there is a weak but specific, diffuse signal throughout the parasite, which might correspond to a cytosolic pool of the protein. Colocalization experiments show that the catalase localization is distinct from other parasite organelles, namely micronemes, rhoptries, dense granules, and the apicoplast (Fig. 6).Figure 6IFA colocalization of catalase with various parasite markers. Catalase (green channel) does not colocalize with various parasite organelles by IFA. Micronemes (a), rhoptries (c), and dense granules (e) (all in the red channel) are labeled with monoclonal mouse antibodies to organellar proteins. The corresponding phase images are shown in b and d. The localization of the apicoplast DNA (f) is visualized by 4′6-diamidino-2-phenylindole staining (red channel) and denoted by arrows; the arrowheads point to the parasite nuclei. Scale bar, 2 μm.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Catalase was localized in T. gondii by histocytochemistry. Catalase can be visualized by precipitation of diaminobenzidine (DAB) under conditions of mild fixation, high substrate (hydrogen peroxide) concentrations, and high pH buffer. The precipitate can be seen in light microscopy as dark spots inside the parasite (Fig.7 c). Treatment with 20 mm 3-amino-1,2,4-triazole, a catalase inhibitor, abolishes the staining (data not shown). By electron microscopy a specific reaction product appears in a juxtanuclear position as a round structure of about 100–300 nm (Fig.7, a and b). It frequently possesses a core with a crystalloid shape. Reaction product in the mitochondrion is not specific for catalase, since it is still prevalent under inhibitor treatment or when the substrate hydrogen peroxide is omitted (data not shown). The functionality of the C-terminal -AKM motif as a peroxisomal targeting signal was tested by expressingT. gondii catalase in CHO cells, which provide a well defined peroxisomal compartment. Transiently expressed full-lengthT. gondii catalase localizes to particulate structures that show the same staining pattern as peroxisomes (Fig.8, c and e). The truncated version of catalase, without the last three amino acids, yields a diffuse staining pattern (Fig. 8 d), which is consistent with a predicted cytosolic localization. To address the question whether the -AKM motif is sufficient to target proteins to peroxisomes, CAT was used as a marker protein. CAT resides in the cytosol and therefore has a diffuse staining pattern (Fig.8 b). Addition of -AKM to the C terminus (CAT-AKM) relocates the protein to particulate structures (Fig. 8 a), suggesting a peroxisomal localization. To confirm targeting of CAT to peroxisomes we expressed CAT-SKL, which is known to reside in peroxisomes (data not shown). Catalase is the characteristic marker enzyme of peroxisomes and is highly conserved across species. The deduced amino acid sequence ofT. gondii catalase has typical features of eukaryotic catalases, e.g. residues that are known to be involved in heme binding, NADPH binding, tetramerization, and protein import are strongly conserved. This suggests a similar catalytic mechanism and localization in peroxisomes. We addressed the latter by analyzing catalase distribution by the electron and light microscope. We identified a distinctive, vesicular compartment anterior to the nucleus that does not overlap with known organelles of the parasite. Since peroxisomal proteins reach their subcellular destination through a specific import mechanism that is mediated by evolutionarily conserved signals, we investigated the functionality of the PTS1-type import signal (-AKM) of T. gondii catalase. This PTS1 motif is necessary and sufficient to target T. gondii catalase and chloramphenicol acetyltransferase to mammalian peroxisomes. Although we have not identified a peroxisomal membrane, due to the difficulties in detection of DAB precipitate in counterstained sections, our data remain consistent with the presence of peroxisomes in T. gondii. The enzymatic activity of catalase, the decomposition of H2O2, and therefore the protection from endogenously produced oxygen radicals are well established. One can also speculate about protection from exogenous H2O2, a mechanism that could potentially facilitate parasite survival during infection. However, in this case, a compartmentalization of catalase seems to be unfavorable, since H2O2 would have to diffuse through the parasite cytosol toward the enzyme. On the other hand, the observed pool of catalase in the parasite cytosol could be sufficient to clear exogenous hydrogen peroxide, whereas the peroxisomal pool might be needed to scavenge the H2O2 production of peroxisomal enzymes. The biochemical role of peroxisomes in T. gondii has yet to be elucidated. Of particular interest will be to determine the contribution of peroxisomal enzymes in lipid synthesis or metabolism. The parasite seems to be deficient in its ability to synthesize cholesterol and selected phospholipids de novo 2I. Coppens, A. Sinai, D. Voelker, and K. A. Joiner, unpublished observations. and presumably acquires these components from the host cell. On the other hand, enzymes involved in fatty acid biosynthesis are imported into theT. gondii apicoplast, a chloroplast remnant present in many if not all Apicomplexan parasites (21.Waller R.F. Keeling P.J. Donald R.G.K. Striepen B. Handman E. Lang-Unnasch N. Cowman A.F. Gurdyal S.B. Roos D.S. McFadden I. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Given the presence inT. gondii of genes for isocitrate lyase and malate synthase, two members of the glyoxylate cycle found in plant glyoxysomes, a role for T. gondii peroxisomes in fatty acid conversion in succinate and ultimately to glucose is also possible. 3E.

Determining the relative contribution of these three pathways to lipid homeostasis within T. gondii will require a detailed understanding of the biochemical composition of the T. gondii peroxisomes and may ultimately provide insights into novel therapeutic approaches.

The protease inhibitors phenylmethylsulphonylfluoride, leupeptin, and pepstatin A and the substrate fructose 1,6-bisphosphate were purchased from Roche Molecular Biochemicals. The reagents for dye terminator sequencing were purchased from Amersham Pharmacia Biotech. The E. coli strain INVαF+ was purchased from Invitrogen. The pET-21(+) expression vector was purchased from NBL Gene Sciences (Northumberland, United Kingdom). Ampicillin, isopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside, and the aldolase substrates fructose 1-phosphate, dihydroxyacetone phosphate, andd-glyceraldehyde, as well as other chemicals and reagents, were from Sigma. Blue Sepharose CL-6B, DEAE-Sepharose and CM-Sepharose, mono-S, desalting PD-10, and Superose 12 columns and resins were obtained from Amersham Pharmacia Biotech. The aldolase B cDNA gene from plasmid pΔXB was amplified by polymerase chain reaction so that a unique HindIII site was introduced downstream of the stop codon of the structural genes, thereby removing the polyadenylation signal by incorporating the primer HP (5′-GGAGCTAAGCTTGCGGGCA-3′) (8.Rellos P. Ali M. Vidailhet M. Sygusch J. Cox T.M. Biochem. J. 1999; 340: 321-327Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). A uniqueEcoRI site was introduced 18 bases upstream of the first codon of the aldolase B structural gene by polymerase chain reaction using the primer ER1 (5′-CGGATAACGAATTCATAAGGAGGAAACAG-3′). Incorporation of this primer also resulted in the introduction of a consensus E. coli ribosome binding site with an ideal spacing of 9 bases immediately preceding the start codon of the structural gene. The amplified DNA was digested with the restriction enzymes HindIII and EcoRI and ligated into the T7 DNA polymerase expression plasmid pET21(+) generating the plasmid pEBR+ (8.Rellos P. Ali M. Vidailhet M. Sygusch J. Cox T.M. Biochem. J. 1999; 340: 321-327Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). Mutations were introduced into the structural gene using the “two primer” method developed by Stratagene Inc. Overlapping mutagenic primers were hybridized onto the pEBR+ plasmid DNA, and mutagenesis was performed with 16 cycles of polymerase chain reaction under conditions of 30 s at 95 °C, 1 min at 55 °C, and 13.5 min at 68 °C. The amplified DNA was digested with 10 units of DpnI and transformed without further treatment. Initial mutagenesis trials indicated that >95% of transformants contained the mutation as detected by colony hybridization analysis (data not shown). The mutations that were introduced into the aldolase B expression system were originally discovered by us in the screening of patients with hereditary fructose intolerance. These natural human aldolase B missense variants are W147R (9.Ali M. Cox T.M. Am. J. Hum. Genet. 1995; 56: 1002-1005PubMed Google Scholar), A149P (7.Cross N.C.P. Tolan D. Cox T.M.

The corresponding primers used for the site specific mutagenesis and the resultant mutant plasmid constructs are as follows: GTTGACTTTGGGAAGCGGCGTGCTGTGCTG and CAGCACAGCACGCCGCTTCCCAAAGTCAAC for pEBR147R (W147R), CACCGTAACAGCTCCCCACCGTACTGTTC and GAACAGTACGGTGGGGAGCTGTTACGGTG for pEBR256P (L256P), GTTTCTCTTATGGATGGGCCCTGCAGGCC and GGCCTGCAGGGCCCATCCATAAGAGAAAC for pEBR303W (R303W), and CGGGCCATGGCTAAGTGCCAGGCGGCCAA and TTGGCCGCCTGGCACTTAGCCATGGCCCG for pEBR334K (N334K). The generation of the A337V expression clone pEBR337V has recently been reported (8.Rellos P. Ali M. Vidailhet M. Sygusch J. Cox T.M. Biochem. J. 1999; 340: 321-327Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). The A149P expression clone pEBR149P was generated by subcloning the cDNA from a polymerase chain reaction-amplified fragment bearing the A149P mutation from the plasmid pA149P (a pΔXB derivative) using the HP and ER1 primers into pET21+. The sequence of plasmid constructs was verified by dideoxy nucleotide sequencing using the dye terminator method (Applied Biosystems Inc.). Expression of recombinant human aldolases was carried out in the protease-deficient E. colihost strain, BL21(DE3), as previously reported (8.Rellos P. Ali M. Vidailhet M. Sygusch J. Cox T.M. Biochem. J. 1999; 340: 321-327Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). 250–500-ml cultures of mutant and wild-type aldolase B bacterial clones were grown in 2YT ampicillin media inoculated from overnight cultures that were grown in this medium supplemented with 0.2% (w/v) glucose. The cells were grown to mid-log phase at either 37 °C (wild-type, W147R, and R303W) or 23 °C (other mutant proteins), and expression was induced by the addition of isopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside to 1 mm. Cells were chilled on ice following a further 2.5 h of growth at 37 °C or approximately 16 h if grown at 23 °C. All subsequent steps were rapidly conducted at 4 °C where possible. The bacteria were harvested by centrifugation and lysed with a mortar and pestle, with alumina added at twice the estimated wet weight of cells. The bacteria were ground for 6–8 periods of 1 min with the addition of DNase and RNase (1 mg/ml) for the last three grindings. The lysed material and alumina mixture was resuspended in 15 ml of 50 mm Tris, 1 mm EDTA, pH 7.6, 10 mm MgCl2, 5% glycerol, 5 mmdithiothreitol, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 20 mg/ml pepstatin, and 20 mg/ml leupeptin A, and the alumina was removed by centrifugation at 3000 × g. Bacterial cultures expressing N334K and A337V aldolase variants were lysed by sonication at 15 μm amplitude in the previously described lysis buffer. The lysates were cleared by centrifugation at 30,000 × g for 1 h at 4 °C for all samples. Lysates containing recombinant wild-type aldolase B and the W147R and R303W mutant aldolases were acid-precipitated by the addition of cold acetic acid to a final pH of about 5.9 and incubated on ice for 15 min. Cell debris rendered insoluble by acid precipitation was removed by centrifugation at 20,000 × g for 20 min at 4 °C. The recombinant proteins A149P, A174D, L256P, N334K, and A337V were found to be unstable, and it was necessary to develop a rapid purification procedure for the isolation: these recombinant proteins were therefore not precipitated under acidic conditions before chromatographic separation. DEAE-Sepharose equilibrated with 10 mmTris·HCl, 1 mm EDTA, pH 7.5, was used as a primary separation step to remove soluble acidic E. coli proteins immediately after generation of cleared bacterial lysates: under these conditions, the recombinant aldolases were not bound to the matrix. Partially purified wild-type and all recombinant mutant proteins were dialyzed against 10 mmMOPS,1 pH 7.0, where the first dialysis buffer included 20 mm NaCl. The dialysate was applied to CM-Sepharose matrix in columns equilibrated with 10 mm MOPS, pH 7.0. The matrix was washed with 10 mm MOPS, pH 7.9, and aldolase protein was eluted with 2 mm fructose 1,6-bisphosphate (FBP) in the same buffer; affinity elution was found to release aldolase protein at greater than 90% purity. The recombinant aldolase R303W partly eluted at a pH of 7.9 without addition of FBP. All samples of purified recombinant human aldolase were rapidly concentrated by ultrafiltration in the presence of 100 mm NaCl using a Millipore ultrafiltration device (30-kDa exclusion). The protein concentrates were finally fractionated on a Superose 12 fast protein liquid chromatography gel exclusion column in 50 mm Tris·HCl, pH 7.6, 100 mmNaCl. Recombinant wild-type and mutant proteins were recovered at a region corresponding to a molecular mass of ∼150 kDa as predicted for homotetrameric class I aldolases. The recombinant proteins were obtained at greater than 98% purity as indicated by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. They were stored in 50 mm Tris·HCl, 10 mm EDTA, pH 7.6, 100 mm NaCl, 1 mm dithiothreitol on ice, and under these conditions, most remained stable for several days. The wild-type, W147R, and R303W proteins remained stable while stored unfrozen for several months on ice. The A174D protein could not be recovered in an active form and bound very weakly to the CM-Sepharose matrix following DEAE-Sepharose passage and equilibration against 10 mm MOPS, pH 7.0. The A174D protein was found to be extremely labile and could be stabilized neither by the presence of 1 mm fructose 1,6-diphosphate, reducing conditions, high ionic strength, nor by being bound either by cation exchange or Blue Sepharose matrices. The protein aggregated rapidly, even when dilute. Unlike the other recombinant aldolase variants, this mutant protein was found to be at low abundance in the host bacterial cells, suggesting that it is rapidly degraded in situ as a result of denaturation. Bacterial lysates containing the expressed N334K and A337V aldolase variants were passaged through DEAE-Sepharose and the eluate was immediately fractionated on Cibacron Blue Sepharose CL-6B affinity matrix (instead of CM-Sepharose). The Blue Sepharose matrix was washed with 50 mm Tris·HCl, 10 mm EDTA, pH 7.6, buffer, and the recombinant proteins were affinity eluted with a pulse of 2–5 mm fructose 1,6-bisphosphate in 50 mmTris, 5 mm EDTA, pH 8.6, to effect purification by affinity chromatography. The A337V mutant was exchanged immediately after the affinity elution step from the Blue Sepharose affinity matrix into 50 mm MOPS buffer solution at pH 7.0 and applied to an fast protein liquid chromatography mono-S Sepharose column. The mutant protein was eluted between 50 and 100 mm NaCl. The original tetrameric isolates of the recombinant mutant aldolases were used for all subsequent determinations of enzymatic activity. Aldolase cleavage activity toward the substrates fructose 1-phosphate and fructose 1,6-bisphosphate was assayed by the spectrophotometric measurement of NADH oxidation at 340 nm by the method of Racker (15.Racker E. J. Biol. Chem. 1947; 167: 843-854Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Enzymatic assays were conducted at 22 °C in a final volume of 1 ml by the addition of aldolase protein to reaction mixtures containing substrate, 0.15 mm NADH, 50 mm Tris-acetate, 10 mm EDTA, pH 7.6, 100 mg/ml bovine serum albumin, and 20 μl of α-glycerophosphate dehydrogenase/triose phosphate isomerase (2 mg/ml). The reactions were monitored for 4 min following an initial 1-min lag phase to ensure linearity. Protein concentration of pure preparations of aldolase was determined spectroscopically by determining the optical absorbance at 280 nm and by using the BCA protein determining method (Pierce) and the DC method (Bio-Rad). All cleavage specific activity andK m assays were done within 1 day of purification. The kinetic estimates were determined by least squares analysis of at least two experiments from two purifications using the Leonora program (16.Cornish-Bowden A. Analysis of Enzyme Kinetic Data. Oxford University Press, New York1995Google Scholar). Fructose 1-phosphate synthesis activities at 22 °C were measured by end point assays from 0 up to 20 min, sampling at 1–5-min intervals, in the previous Tris-acetate buffer containing 100 mg of bovine serum albumin and 45 mm each of d-glyceraldehyde and dihydroxyacetone phosphate. All mutants demonstrated linear kinetics in the synthesis reaction over this time period (data not shown). Fructose 1-phosphate generated in the synthesis was quantified by the method of Berthiaume et al. (17.Berthiaume L. Loisel T.P. Sygusch J. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266 (17015): 17099Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Absorbances were read at 380 and 412 nm, and the differences obtained between A 412and A 380 were compared with a standard curve using dilutions of fructose 1-phosphate and appropriate blank solutions. Generation of the carbanion intermediates in the aldolase reaction was determined by monitoring the formation of carbanion-enamine enzyme-substrate intermediates when oxidized in the presence of hexacyanoferrate (III) to yield hydroxypyruvaldehyde phosphate (18.Healy M.J. Christen P. Biochemistry. 1973; 12: 35-41Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). The reaction was monitored at 420 nm using 50 mg/ml aldolase protein in 200 mm Tris-glycine, pH 7.3, 1.43 mmK3Fe(CN)6, 100 mg/ml bovine serum albumin, and 1 mm of either fructose 1,6-diphosphate or dihydroxyacetone-P or 50 mm fructose 1-phosphate. The initial rate of the reaction over 24 s was used to determine the rate of reduction for the preparations of mutant aldolases B; generation of carbanions by wild-type aldolase B was followed at the initial reaction rate for 18 s. The amount of hexacyanoferrate (III) reduced to hexacyanoferrous ion (II) was determined by calibrating the optical absorbance of diluted standard solutions of potassium ferrocyanide at 420 nm. As judged by SDS-gel electrophoresis and densitometric scanning, the recombinant wild-type and mutant proteins were all expressed to about 30% of soluble cellular protein levels in E. coli after induction for 2.5 h at 37 °C (16 h induction at 22 °C for A149P, A174D, L256P, N334K, and A337V). The purity of the recombinant proteins was close to homogeneity as detected by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (Fig. 1). When analyzed by gel exclusion chromatography on Superose-12, the wild-type, W147R, R303W, and A337V enzymes had molecular masses of about 158 kDa, which corresponds to the native tetrameric molecular mass of the aldolase B purified from human liver (19.Gurtler B. Bally C. Leuthardt F. Hoppe-Seyler's Z. Physiol. Chem. 1971; 352: 1455-1462Crossref PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar) (Fig. 2). The mutant protein L256P eluted from the molecular exclusion column as two peaks with molecular masses estimated to be 158 and 60–40 kDa, indicating that the mutant tetramer partly dissociated into its constituent subunits during purification and storage. The A149P and N334K aldolase variants were isolated originally as a polydisperse mixture of protein conformers that encompassed all molecular sizes between tetramer and monomer. The mutant proteins A149P, L256P, N334K, and A337V dissociated to produce monomeric proteins after several days of storage (Fig. 2 B).Figure 2Molecular exclusion chromatography of recombinant human aldolase B and natural human variants.Chromatograms of recombinant aldolase B and natural variants were obtained by fractionating protein samples 2 days after initial purification through a Superose 12 gel exclusion column using an Amersham Pharmacia Biotech SMARTTM system. The protein was resolved by elution at 22 °C in 50 mm Tris·HCl, 100 mm NaCl. Panel A depicts the elution profile of wild-type and mutants that maintained a tetrameric quaternary structure after 2 days of incubation in 50 mm Tris·HCl, 100 mm NaCl. The molecular masses of the protein standards used in the calibration are as follows: bovine γ globulin, 158 kDa; chicken ovalbumin, 44 kDa; equine myoglobin; 17 kDa. Panel Bdepicts the elution profile of mutants that dissociated into monomeric subunits after 2 days of storage at 4 °C.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) In this study, aldolase activity was used as a measure of enzyme integrity. Once purified, recombinant wild-type human aldolase B was stable and maintained a high specific activity that declined slowly by about 50% after 3 months storage. Over this period, a progressive increase in the Michaelis constant for both hexose substrates and in the hydrodynamic radius of the protein was observed. In contrast, the mutant aldolases all had accelerated loss of activity and reduced stability (TableI). The aldolase mutants were not stabilized by the presence of substrate (FBP), reducing agents, high ionic strength, or binding to cation exchange or affinity dye resins. Once dissociated, the mutant aldolases aggregated freely, even when dilute. For instance, the mutant A149P aldolase when purified as a monomer aggregated rapidly as shown by its increasing hydrodynamic radius in solution; within 30 min of sampling, its molecular weight exceeded the technical limit of estimation (Fig.3).Table IProperties of recombinant aldolase B variantsProteinIsolated molecular formaTetramer (T) or monomer (M) when expressed at 37 °C for wild-type, W147R, and R303W and 22 °C for all other mutants.Long term stabilitybAs stored in 50 mm Tris·HCl, pH 7.6, 100 mm NaCl at 4 °C.Activities of monomerscAs compared with wild-type.t 1/2dTemperature at which half activity is retained after 15 min of incubation.%°CWild-typeT∼3 months<550W147RT∼3 months<553A149PT and M∼2 days<525L256PT and M∼2 days<545R303WT∼3 months<552N334KT and M∼30 minNDeND, not determined.50A337VT∼2 weeks<550a Tetramer (T) or monomer (M) when expressed at 37 °C for wild-type, W147R, and R303W and 22 °C for all other mutants.b As stored in 50 mm Tris·HCl, pH 7.6, 100 mm NaCl at 4 °C.c As compared with wild-type.d Temperature at which half activity is retained after 15 min of incubation.e ND, not determined. Open table in a new tab The recombinant A174D, L256P, and N334K aldolases proved difficult to recover when expressed at 37 °C, suggesting that they undergo rapid proteolysis when expressed in E. coli. It is likely that they are partly denatured in situ at this temperature, thus precluding formation of stable tetramers, because correct subunit folding will be critical for tetrameric assembly and cohesion. Accordingly, subsequent purification of the recombinant A149P, A174D, L256P, and N334K aldolases were carried out after expression at 22–23 °C. The induction period was extended to 16 h, and all subsequent purification procedures were carried out rapidly and at temperatures below 10 °C. A model of the rabbit aldolase B subunit structure determined from the high order crystal structure onto which the disease mutations have been mapped is presented in Fig.4. 2N. S. Blom, A. White, and J. Sygusch, manuscript in preparation.On the basis of their behavior during purification, we assigned the mutant aldolases to two classes: catalytic mutants that can be expressed in an intact tetrameric form that retained activity at 37 °C (W147R and R303W) and structural mutants that generate catalytically active enzymes only after expression at 22–23 °C (A149P, L256P, and N334K). The A337V variant was intermediate in character because it can be expressed as a tetramer with residual activity at 37 °C but appears more prone to proteolysis in E. coli at this temperature (8.Rellos P. Ali M. Vidailhet M. Sygusch J. Cox T.M. Biochem. J. 1999; 340: 321-327Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). The wild-type and all mutant proteins except for A149P and L256P had similar thermostability profiles (Table I). All of the mutants except A149P and L256P had t 12 temperatures close to 50 °C, similar to the native human liver aldolase B (19.Gurtler B. Bally C. Leuthardt F. Hoppe-Seyler's Z. Physiol. Chem. 1971; 352: 1455-1462Crossref PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar). That thermal inactivation was associated with denaturation was evident from the precipitates that formed at the t 12 temperature for all the proteins examined. The mutant A149P and L256P proteins were particularly prone to thermal inactivation, as demonstrated by their reduced t 12 temperatures of 25 °C and 45 °C, respectively. This temperature sensitivity indicates that the structural integrity of these proteins is profoundly disrupted. A149P affects an internal residue in the active site region and probably distorts each subunit of the tetramer. This subunit distortion is likely to be communicated to the subunit contact sites by long range conformational changes; unfavorable subunit contacts thus formed would predispose the protein to dissociation and inactivation. This was demonstrated by the tendency of the A149P variant to aggregate when expressed at 37 °C, a temperature at which the purified protein was found to be unstable in vitro (Fig. 3). The L256P mutation affects the interface between the aldolase subunits; it thereby impairs assembly of the stable tetrameric molecule. It was notable that this protein variant showed a slight decrease in thermal stability, indicating that the integrity of the tetramer contributes to the overall protein stability (21.Beernink P.T. Tolan D.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 5374-5379Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). Surprisingly, the thermal stability profile of the N334K mutant aldolase B did not greatly differ from wild-type, even though it could only be purified after expression at the lower temperature. It is likely this protein variant forms two distinct conformers at 22 and at 37 °C and that the conformer generated at physiological temperatures may be partially unfolded while still maintaining sufficient structural integrity to retain catalytic activity. The N334K conformer produced at 37 °C is likely to be more vulnerable to proteolytic cleavage in E. coli than the conformer generated at 22 °C; indeed, this phenomenon has been observed with the A337V variant (8.Rellos P. Ali M. Vidailhet M. Sygusch J. Cox T.M. Biochem. J. 1999; 340: 321-327Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). The A337V and N334K residues are situated in a region of the protein that is immediately proximal to the C terminus. The A337V variant of aldolase B was isolated as a partly truncated protein at 37 °C, indicating that it also forms a distinct conformer at this temperature that is sensitive to proteolysis inE. coli, probably because it is also partly denatured. No proteolysis was detected when the A337V protein was expressed at 22 °C, indicating that the conformer produced at the lower temperature is fully intact (8.Rellos P. Ali M. Vidailhet M. Sygusch J. Cox T.M. Biochem. J. 1999; 340: 321-327Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). The specific activities and Michaelis constants of the aldolase cleavage and condensation reactions of the enzyme variants are presented in TableII. The structural mutants all consistently dissociated into minimally active monomers (Table I). All the mutant aldolases had reduced catalytic activity toward the substrates FBP and F-1-P as expected from their causal association with the disease hereditary fructose intolerance. Those variants possessing appreciable residual catalytic activity were those that could be isolated by gel filtration chromatography as homotetrameric conformers. The catalytic activity of all the mutants was predominantly associated with the tetrameric fraction isolated by gel filtration.Table IISpecific activities and Km estimations of recombinant aldolase B (at 22 °C)ProteinFDP cleavageF-1-P cleavageFDP/F-1-PF-1-P synthesiscF-1-P synthesis using 45 mm each of DHAP andd-glyceraldehyde.S/CdF-1-P synthesis specific activity/F-1-P cleavage specific activity.SAaSpecific activities determined from a minimum of two preparations, where each preparation was assayed over a minimum of two separate experiments with triplicate samplings.K mbK m estimated from a minimum of two preparations, wher"

Although this enzyme(s) has not been purified and cloned from higher organisms, one mammalian cDNA has been previously isolated based on its similarity to the bacterial enzyme. To further elucidate the function of this neutral sphingomyelinase, we studied its relationship with enzymes present in mammalian cells and tissues, its subcellular localization, and properties that could be important for the regulation of its activity. Using specific antibodies, it is suggested that the enzyme could represent one of several forms of neutral sphingomyelinases present in the extract from brain particulate fraction. In PC12 cells, the enzyme is localized in the endoplasmic reticulum and is not present in the plasma membrane. The same result has been obtained in several cell lines transfected or microinjected with plasmids encoding this enzyme. The molecular and enzymatic properties of the cloned neutral magnesium-dependent sphingomyelinase, produced using baculovirus or bacterial expression systems, have been analyzed, demonstrating the expected ion dependence and substrate specificity. The enzyme activity also has a strong requirement for reducing agents and is reversibly inhibited by reactive oxygen species and oxidized glutathione. The studies demonstrate that the cellular localization and some properties of this enzyme are distinct from properties previously associated with neutral magnesium-dependent sphingomyelinases in crude or partially purified preparations.

Although ceramide can be generated by de novo synthesis, for the majority of cellular responses it is produced by sphingomyelin hydrolysis catalyzed by sphingomyelinases. Several types of sphingomyelinase activities have been characterized in mammalian cells according to optimal pH, ion dependence, and localization: an acidic form, a Zn2+-dependent secreted form, an alkaline form, and both cytosolic Mg2+-independent and transmembrane Mg2+-dependent neutral forms (1.Levade T.

The most extensively studied of these enzymes are the acidic and neutral Mg2+-dependent sphingomyelinases, both of which have been considered as signaling enzymes. Acidic sphingomyelinase (ASM)1 is a lysosomal enzyme, its main function being the metabolic degradation of sphingomyelin. The lysosomal storage disorder, Niemann-Pick disease, is caused by mutations in ASM (5.Sakuragawa N. Mito T. Kawada A. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1994; 1213: 193-198Crossref PubMed Scopus (6) Google Scholar). The enzyme has been cloned (6.Quintern L.E. Schuchman E.H. Levran O. Suchi M. Ferlinz K. Reinke H. Sandhoff K. Desnick R.J. EMBO J. 1989; 8: 2469-2473Crossref PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar), and while there are at least three transcripts, only one mRNA for ASM has been identified (7.Schuchman E.H. Suchi M. Takahashi T. Sandhoff K. Desnick R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 8531-8539Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The same gene encodes Zn2+-dependent secreted sphingomyelinase (8.Schissel S.L. Schuchman E.H. Williams K.J. Tabas I. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 18431-18436Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (251) Google Scholar). ASM knockout mice develop normally for approximately 10 weeks, after which they develop symptoms consistent with Niemann-Pick disease (9.Otterbach B. Stoffel W. Cell. 1995; 81: 1053-1061Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (189) Google Scholar,10.Horinouchi K. Erlich S. Perl D.P. Ferlinz K. Bisgaier C.L. Sandhoff K. Desnick R.J. Stewart C.L. Schuchman E.H. Nat. Genet. 1995; 10: 288-293Crossref PubMed Scopus (412) Google Scholar). There is also evidence that this enzyme could participate in signaling responses. The production of ceramide via ASM activation has been observed in response to extracellular signals such as TNFα (11.Schwandner R. Wiegmann K. Bernardo K. Kreder D. Kronke M. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 5916-5922Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar) and Fas ligand (12.Cifone M.G. Roncaioli P. De Maria R. Camarda G. Santoni A. Ruberti G. Testi R.

EMBO J. 1997; 16: 6200-6208Crossref PubMed Scopus (279) Google Scholar), which suggested a potential role for this enzyme in apoptosis. However, studies of cells obtained from ASM knockout mice and Niemann-Pick disease patients resulted in observations showing either an absolute requirement for ASM or normal signaling responses in the absence of this gene (1.Levade T. Jaffrezou J.-P. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1999; 1438: 1-17Crossref PubMed Scopus (283) Google Scholar). This discrepancy could be, in part, due to different cell types and extracellular signals used in a specific study. Neutral Mg2+-dependent sphingomyelinase (NSM) activation has been implicated in apoptosis (14.Adam D. Weigmann K. Adam-Klages S. Ruff A. Kronke M. J. Biol.

Pauig S.B. Daniel L.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 15493-15497Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In the case of TNFα, which activates both NSM and ASM, it has been shown that different domains on the TNF receptor and distinct adapter proteins are required to stimulate the two enzymes (21.Adam-Klages S. Schwandner R. Adam D. Kreder D. Bernardo K. Kronke M. J. Leukocyte Biol. 1998; 63: 678-682Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). An adapter protein FAN (factor associated withNSM activation), which interacts with the NSM activation domain on the TNFα receptor, is likely to provide a link to the stimulation of NSM. This is supported by the observations that overexpression of FAN enhances NSM activity (22.Adam-Klages S. Adam D. Wiegmann K. Struve S. Kolanus W. Schneider-Mergener J. Kronke M. Cell. 1996; 86: 937-947Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (357) Google Scholar) and that FAN-deficient mice are impaired in TNF-induced NSM activation (23.Kreder D. Krut O. Adam-Klages S. Wiegmann K. Scherer G. Plitz T. Jensen J.-M. Proksch E. Steinmann J. Pfeffer K. Kronke M. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 2472-2479Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). A number of other molecules have been shown to regulate NSM activity, at least in vitro (1.Levade T. Jaffrezou J.-P. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1999; 1438: 1-17Crossref PubMed Scopus (283) Google Scholar, 4.Liu B. Obeid L.M. Hannun Y.A. Semin. Cell Dev. Biol. 1997; 8: 311-322Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar). For example, recent studies have suggested that glutathione, within a physiological range, could regulate NSM activity by reversibly inhibiting the enzyme (24.Liu B. Hannun Y.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 16281-16287Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (280) Google Scholar). Although an increase in NSM activity has been described in many cellular systems, the purification of NSM and its molecular entity have remained elusive. Recently, NSM from mouse and human (referred to as mammalian NSM (mNSM)) were identified by their similarity with the bacterial neutral sphingomyelinases (25.Tomiuk S. Hofmann K. Nix M. Zumbansen M. Stoffel W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 3638-3643Crossref PubMed Scopus (259) Google Scholar). The enzymes were cloned, subsequently expressed, and exhibited similar characteristics to those described for the partially purified brain enzyme. In addition, it has been shown that TNFα stimulation of transfected cells resulted only in a moderate increase in ceramide levels, while the TNFα-triggered apoptosis was not enhanced compared with the control cells (25.Tomiuk S. Hofmann K. Nix M. Zumbansen M. Stoffel W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 3638-3643Crossref PubMed Scopus (259) Google Scholar). This suggested that the cloned molecule may not be the enzyme participating in TNFα signaling. More generally, several other critical issues remained, including the relationship of the cloned molecule with the NSM activity in cells, its subcellular localization, and regulatory mechanisms that control the enzyme activity. In this study, which is focused on the cloned mammalian NSM, we present evidence suggesting that this enzyme represents one of several isoforms of NSM, that it associates with an intracellular membrane rather than the plasma membrane, and that reversible inactivation by reactive oxygen species could provide one level of control of its activity. [methyl-14C]Sphingomyelin (SM), phosphatidyl[methyl-3H]choline (PC), phosphatidyl[2-14C]ethanolamine (PE), phosphatidyl[3-14C]serine (PS), and fast protein liquid chromatography columns were supplied by Amersham Pharmacia Biotech. Phosphatidyl[2-3H]inositol (PI), and phosphatidyl[2-3H]inositol 4,5-bisphosphate (PIP2) were from NEN Life Science Products. The transfection reagents, Lipofectin, lipofectAMINE, and lipofectAMINEPLUS were obtained from Life Technologies, Inc. Oligonucleotides were purchased from Oswel. The vector pBac4x-1 was from Novagen, pEGFP-C1 was from CLONTECH, and pGEX-2T was from Amersham Pharmacia Biotech. BaculoGold linearized baculovirus DNA was from Pharmingen. Anti-calnexin antibodies were from Bioquote Ltd., anti-His antibody was purchased from Qiagen, and conjugated wheat germ agglutinins (WGAs) were from Sigma. Actigel-ALD beads were purchased from Sterogene, and Probond Nickel resin was from Invitrogen. Complete protease inhibitor tablets were from Roche Molecular Biochemicals. Recombinant mouse NSM was amplified by polymerase chain reaction from a mouse liver cDNA library using primers 5′-CGGGATCCATGAAGCTCAACTTTTCTCTAC-3′ and 5′-CGGAATTCTTAAGCTCTGTCCCCCTCC-3′ (with incorporatedBamHI and EcoRI sites underlined). The polymerase chain reaction product was cloned using theBamHI/EcoRI sites of the mammalian expression vector PLINK to generate Myc-tagged recombinant protein (Myc.NSM). Inserts without any mutations were then subcloned into the pEGFP-C1 vector (to generate Gfp-tagged protein, Gfp.NSM), the baculovirus expression vector pBac4x-1 (to generate His-tagged protein, His.NSM), and the bacterial vector pGEX-2T (to generate a GST fusion protein, GST.NSM). Rabbit anti-NSM antibodies were raised against the synthetic peptide NH2-LLEEVWSEQDFQYLR-COOH, which represents residues 46–60 of both the murine and human NSM coupled to purified protein derivative. To affinity-purify the antibodies, 1 mg of the synthetic peptide was coupled to 5 ml of Actigel-ALD beads. Immune serum (5 ml) was diluted with an equal volume of PBS and loaded onto a column containing 2 ml of resin. Following washing with PBS, antibodies were eluted with 2 ml of 100 mm glycine, pH 2.5, and immediately buffered with 1 m Tris-HCl, pH 8. The purified IgG was analyzed by SDS-PAGE, and the antibodies were stored at −20 °C in the presence of protease inhibitors. COS, NIH 3T3, and MDCK cells were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum and 3 mm glutamine. PC12 cells were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 5% fetal calf serum, 10% horse serum, and 3 mm glutamine. All cells were grown at 37 °C under 5% CO2. Insect (Sf9) cells were grown in shaker flasks in TNM-FH medium supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum, 1× lipid mixture (Life Technologies, Inc.), 5 mm glutamine, penicillin (50 IU/ml), streptomycin (50 μg/ml), and fungizone (0.25 μg/ml). The cells were grown at 27 °C shaking at 150 rpm. For transfection, Sf9 cells were grown in monolayers in Grace's medium supplemented with glutamine, penicillin, streptomycin, and 10% fetal calf serum. For microinjection, PC12 and 3T3 cells were plated at 106 on 6-cm dishes for 24 h before use. MDCK cells were grown to confluence. Gfp.NSM DNA (25 μg/ml) was microinjected into the nucleus of the cells. Following a 2-h incubation, the cells were analyzed using a Bio-Rad MRC 1024 confocal imaging system configured for FITC fluorescence. For transfection of COS cells, the cells were plated at 8 × 105 on 10-cm dishes and left overnight. The following day, 5.1 μg of DNA (diluted to 0.025 μg/ml) was added to 34 μl of lipofectAMINE and left to form complexes for 15 min. The cells were washed in serum-free media, and the DNA-lipofectAMINE complexes were subsequently added to the cells in serum-free media. Following a 6-h incubation at 37 °C, the cells were washed, incubated for 24 h in medium supplemented with serum, and Gfp fluorescence or immunofluorescence was analyzed by confocal microscopy. For analysis of NSM activity, the cells were washed in PBS, scraped from the dishes, and harvested by centrifugation (1000 × g, 5 min). 3T3 cells were plated at 2 × 105 and MDCK cells were plated at 2.5 × 105 on 6-cm dishes and grown overnight. The following day, DNA was mixed with PLUS reagent in a total volume of 50 μl for 15 min as follows: for 3T3, 1.2 μg DNA and 8 μl of PLUS reagent; for MDCK, 1 μg DNA and 8 μl of PLUS regent. LipofectAMINE (8 μl for 3T3 cells and 10 μl for MDCK cells) was added to the DNA/PLUS reagent mixture in a total volume of 50 μl (total transfection volume of 100 μl). Following washing with serum-free media, the DNA complexes were added to the cells and incubated for 3 h. After 24 h in medium supplemented with serum, cells were analyzed as described for COS cells. Cells were washed twice with PBS and then fixed for 10 min with 0.4% formaldehyde. The cells were permeabilized for 10 min with 100 mm glycine and 0.1% Triton X-100 (pH 7.0). Nonspecific binding was blocked by a 5-min incubation in PBS containing 0.1% BSA. Primary antibody was added in PBS with 0.1% BSA (anti-calnexin (1:200), anti-NSM (1:500)) and incubated for 1 h at room temperature. Following washing, the Texas Red- or FITC-conjugated antibody was added for 30 min at room temperature. The cells were washed, mounted, and viewed by confocal microscopy. Sf9 cells were plated at 106 cells/well in a six-well plate and allowed to attach for at least 1 h. The cells were then washed twice in serum-free media. 1 μg of pBac4x-1/NSM DNA was mixed with 0.1 μg of linearized baculovirus DNA (BaculoGold) in a total volume of 12 μl. Lipofectin (8 μl) was diluted with 4 μl of PBS and then mixed with the DNA mixture. Following a 15-min incubation, the DNA-Lipofectin complexes were added to the cells and incubated for 4 h. The cells were then washed twice and incubated in media with serum for 3 days before being transferred to a 75-cm2 flask. Primary virus was harvested 7–10 days later and used to infect 107 cells to generate secondary virus. Tertiary (high titer) virus was similarly produced and used for infection. Large scale virus was produced from suspension cultures. For infection, cells growing in suspension were diluted to 106 cells/ml, and 10 ml of virus stock was added. Cells were harvested 72 h after infection and washed in PBS, and the pellet was stored at −20 °C until required. Confluent PC12 cells from four 15-cm dishes were washed twice with PBS, scraped from the dish, and harvested by centrifugation. Following resuspension in 4 ml of 25 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 0.1% Triton X-100, 1 mmEDTA, 1 mm DTT, and protease inhibitors, the cells were sonicated for 10 s on medium power and then subjected to centrifugation at 1000 × g for 5 min to obtain the postnuclear supernatant (PNS). The PNS was loaded onto a Mono Q 5/5 column and fractionated with a 15-ml NaCl gradient (0–1m). Fractions of 0.5 ml were collected. Cell pellets were resuspended in (40 ml/liter of original culture) 25 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 0.1% Triton X-100, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm DTT, and protease inhibitors (buffer A), sonicated, and centrifuged to generate the PNS. The PNS was loaded onto a Mono Q 16/10 column. Activity was eluted in 5-ml fractions with a 300-ml NaCl gradient (0–0.5 m). The active fractions were pooled and buffer-exchanged into 20 mm sodium phosphate, 500 mm NaCl, 0.2% Triton X-100, pH 7.8. The sample was bound to 6 ml (bed volume) of nickel-resin for 45 min at 4 °C. Batch washing/eluting was carried out for 5 min each time followed by centrifugation. The resin was extensively washed with 20 mm sodium phosphate, 500 mm NaCl, 0.2% Triton X-100, pH 6.0. Activity was eluted with 5 × 1.5 bed volumes of 250 mm imidazole, 20 mm sodium phosphate, 500 mm NaCl, 0.5% Triton X-100, pH 6.0. The active sample was exchanged into buffer A without protease inhibitors and applied to a 5-ml Hi-trap heparin-Sepharose column. The activity was eluted in 1-ml fractions with a 30-ml salt gradient. Pooled active fractions were then concentrated to 300 μl. 200 μl of sample was loaded onto a Superose-12 10/30 gel filtration column equilibrated in 20 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, 0.1% Triton X-100, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm DTT. Following a void volume of 7 ml, 250-μl fractions were collected. The active fractions were pooled and adjusted to 10% glycerol (which was found to help stabilize the protein) and stored at −20 °C. GST.NSM production was induced with 0.2 mmisopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside and grown for 18 h at 25 °C. Cells were pelleted by centrifugation and resuspended in (8 ml/liter of original culture) PBS, 2 mmDTT, 1 mm EDTA, 1% Triton X-100, and protease inhibitors. Following sonication and centrifugation (10,000 × gfor 10 min), the supernatant was added to glutathione-beads and incubated rotating at 4 °C for 90 min. Fusion protein was eluted with 10 mm glutathione for 3 × 30 min at room temperature. Eluted and dialyzed GST.NSM was stored at −20 °C in 10% glycerol. Mouse brains (5 g) were washed four times with PBS. The brains were then homogenized using a pestle glass homogenizer with 50 ml of homogenizing buffer (25 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 2 mm EDTA, 5 mm DTT, and protease inhibitors). The crude homogenate was subjected to centrifugation for 1 h at 100,000 ×g. The resulting pellet was rehomogenized in 50 ml of homogenizing buffer containing 1 m NaCl and stirred for 30 min at 4 °C. The pellet obtained after centrifugation was then resuspended in homogenization buffer containing 1% Triton X-100, stirred for 30 min at 4 °C, and again subjected to centrifugation. The supernatant was designated the mouse brain membrane protein extract. The membrane protein extract (10 ml) containing 40 mg of protein was loaded onto a Mono Q 5/5 column equilibrated in 25 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 0.1% Triton X-100, 1 mmDTT, 1 mm EDTA. Protein was eluted with a 20-ml NaCl gradient (0–0.5 m). Fractions of 0.5 ml were collected. This method was used to further purify peak 1, resulting from chromatography on a Mono Q column described above, as well as to determine the molecular size of this preparation and of partially purified His.NSM. Concentrated peak 1 NSM from mouse brain (400 μg) or partially purified His.NSM (100 μg) were loaded onto a SMART Superose-12 column in a total volume of 50 μl. Chromatography was carried out in 25 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 0.1% Triton X-100, 1 mm DTT, 1 mm EDTA, 250 mm NaCl. Fractions of 80 μl were collected. Molecular mass markers, aldolase (158 kDa), BSA (67 kDa), ovalbumin (43 kDa), chymotrypsinogen (25 kDa), and ribonuclease A (13.7 kDa), were subjected to chromatography under identical conditions, i.e.in the presence of 0.1% Triton X-100. The activities of both NSM and ASM were measured using radiolabeled substrate. 5 μCi of [14C]sphingomyelin was dried under N2 and resuspended in 1 ml of 2.5 mg/ml cold sphingomyelin in 10 mm Tris, pH 6.8. For NSM activity, the reaction mixture contained 5 μl of substrate, 50 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 0.05% Triton X-100, 1 mg/ml BSA, 10 mm MgCl2, 10 mm DTT, and enzyme preparation unless otherwise described in a total volume of 50 μl. ASM activity was monitored in a similar way, except 50 mm sodium acetate, pH 5.1, was used, and no MgCl2 or DTT was added. Following a 1-h incubation at 37 °C, the reaction was quenched with 250 μl of CHCl3/MeOH/HCl (100:100:0.6). Phase separation was achieved with the addition of 75 μl of 1 m HCl and subsequent centrifugation. A sample (200 μl) of the aqueous phase was removed, and 3 ml of scintillant was added for radioactivity counting. One unit of activity is defined as μmol of SM hydrolyzed/h. For measurements of hydrolyzing activities toward PC, PI, PIP2, PE, and PS, the assay was performed as above. The substrates were made to the same concentration as the SM substrate with the same ratios of radioactive to nonradioactive lipid. When phosphoinositide-specific phospholipase C (isoform δ1) was used in the assay, the preparation of the enzyme and the assay conditions were as described before (26.Ellis M.V. James S.R. Perisic O. Downes C.P. Williams R.L. Katan M. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 11650-11659Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar). Protein concentrations were calculated from a standard curve generated from BSA standards using a Bradford assay (Bio-Rad). Samples for gel electrophoresis were combined with 4× SDS sample buffer and boiled for 5 min, and the protein was separated on SDS-PAGE gels. Gels were stained as indicated in the figure legends. For Western blotting, following separation by SDS-PAGE, protein was transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride membrane. The membrane was blocked with Tris-buffered saline/Tween containing 5% dried milk powder for 1 h. Primary antibody (anti-His (1:1000), anti-NSM (1:500), anti-GST (1:15,000)) was added for 1 h in Tris-buffered saline/Tween followed by washing. Secondary antibody (anti-rabbit or anti-mouse), which is conjugated to horseradish peroxidase, was added (1:2000) for 30–60 min. Following washing, ECL was used for detection. Both the mammalian acidic and neutral sphingomyelinases hydrolyze sphingomyelin, but they share no sequence similarity (Fig.1 A). Although dissimilar at the level of primary structure, both proteins contain a transmembrane domain(s) near the C terminus. While ASM is significantly glycosylated, which is essential for its function (27.Newrzella D. Stoffel W. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 32089-32095Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar, 28.Ferlinz K. Hurwitz R. Moczall H. Lansmann S. Schuchman E.H. Sandhoff K. Eur. J. Biochem. 1997; 243: 511-517Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar), the NSM sequence contains a single putative glycosylation site (Fig. 1 A). Human and mouse NSM clones of mammalian enzymes have been identified (25.Tomiuk S. Hofmann K. Nix M. Zumbansen M. Stoffel W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 3638-3643Crossref PubMed Scopus (259) Google Scholar), which share 81% identity. For this study, DNA encoding the mouse enzyme was amplified from a mouse liver cDNA library and is designated as mNSM to refer specifically to this clone. The encoded protein was expressed as both a Myc-tagged and Gfp-tagged enzyme in COS cells. As shown in Fig. 1 B, the cloned enzyme exhibited magnesium-dependent activity at neutral pH with negligible activity at acidic pH, in contrast to ASM, which showed characteristic high activity at pH 5. These results are consistent with the previous observations (25.Tomiuk S. Hofmann K. Nix M. Zumbansen M. Stoffel W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 3638-3643Crossref PubMed Scopus (259) Google Scholar) and, in addition, demonstrate that the presence of either the Myc or Gfp tag is compatible with the activity. A polyclonal anti-peptide antibody was raised against the sequence (residues 46–60 in mouse NSM) present in both the human and mouse enzymes and subsequently affinity-purified. The antibody did not cross-react with any proteins around 40 kDa present in the PNS of mock-transfected COS cells (Fig. 1 C, lane 1), whereas a strong signal is detected in Myc.NSM-transfected cells (Fig. 1 C, lane 2). The specific band present in Myc.NSM-transfected COS cells was also detected by anti-Myc antibodies (data not shown), further supporting its identity as mNSM. NSM activity has been described in plasma membranes (29.Liu P. Anderson R.G.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 27179-27185Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (301) Google Scholar, 30.Spence M.W. Wakkary J. Clarke J.T.R. Cook H.W. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1982; 719: 162-164Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar), crude microsomes (31.Hostetler K.Y. Yazaki P.J. J. Lipid Res. 1979; 20: 456-463Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), and nuclear membranes (32.Tamiya-Koizumi K. Umekawa H. Yoshida S. Kojima K. J. Biochem. (Tokyo). 1989; 106: 593-598Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar, 33.Alessenko A. Chatterjee S. Mol. Cell. Biochem. 1995; 143: 169-174Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). To study the cellular localization of mNSM, the Gfp- and Myc-tagged constructs were introduced into different cell lines by microinjection and transfection. Gfp.NSM plasmid was microinjected into the nuclei of PC12, Swiss 3T3, and MDCK cells. Following a 2-h incubation, the observed fluorescence indicated the presence of Gfp.NSM in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) and nuclear membrane in all three cell lines (Fig.2 A). Identical localization was demonstrated after microinjection of Myc.NSM plasmid (data not shown). To further confirm this observation, NIH 3T3, COS, and MDCK cells were transfected with Gfp.NSM for 24 h and subsequently stained for the ER marker calnexin (Fig. 2 B). When Gfp.NSM localization was superimposed on that of calnexin, colocalization was clearly demonstrated in all three cell lines examined (Fig.2 B, Merge). The localization to ER could involve an ER retention signal (KDEL or the more recently described HDEF signal (34.Kaletta K. Kunze I. Kunze G. Kock M. FEBS Lett. 1998; 434: 377-381Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar)) or other types of interactions (35.Trombetta E.S. Helenius A. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 3282-3292Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). The mNSM lacks recognized ER retention signals, and while this does not exclude such a localization, it was important to establish whether the endogenous enzyme exhibited the same localization as seen in the microin"
https://openalex.org/W2068648293,"Human alpha(2)-macroglobulin-proteinase complexes bind to their receptor, the low density lipoprotein receptor-related protein (LRP), through a discrete 138-residue C-terminal receptor binding domain (RBD), which also binds to the beta-amyloid peptide. We have used NMR spectroscopy on recombinantly expressed uniformly (13)C/(15)N-labeled human RBD to determine its three-dimensional structure in solution. Human RBD is a sandwich of two antiparallel beta-sheets, one four-strand and one five-strand, and also contains one alpha-helix of 2.5 turns and an additional 1-turn helical region. The principal alpha-helix contains two lysine residues on the outer face that are known to be essential for receptor binding. A calcium binding site (K(d) approximately 11 mM) is present in the loop region at one end of the beta-sandwich. Calcium binding principally affects this loop region and does not significantly perturb the stable core structure of the domain. The structure and NMR assignments will enable us to examine in solution specific binding of RBD to domains of the receptor and to beta-amyloid peptide."
https://openalex.org/W2043206956,"Plant cells contain a complete oxidative pentose phosphate pathway in the chloroplasts, but an incomplete pathway was proposed to be present in the cytosol, with cytosolic (cyt) isoforms of ribulose-5-phosphate 3-epimerase (RPEase) and other non-oxidative branch enzymes being undetectable. Here we present for the first time the identification, cloning, and properties of a cyt-RPEase in rice (Oryza sativa) and presence of its homologues in other plant species. Recombinant cyt-RPEase is a homodimer of 24.3-kDa subunits such as in the case of the animal and yeast enzymes, whereas the chloroplast (chl) RPEase is a hexamer. Cytosolic and chloroplastic RPEases cannot be separated by anion exchange chromatography. Since plant cyt-RPEase is more closely related in its primary structure to homologous enzymes in animal and yeast cells than to the chloroplast RPEase, the plant nuclear genes coding for cytosolic and chloroplast RPEases were most likely derived from eubacteria and cyanobacteria, respectively. Accumulation of cyt-RPEase-mRNA and protein is high in root cells, lacking chl-RPEase, and lower in green tissue. These and other observations support the view that green and non-green plant cells possess a complete oxidative pentose phosphate pathway in the cytosol. Plant cells contain a complete oxidative pentose phosphate pathway in the chloroplasts, but an incomplete pathway was proposed to be present in the cytosol, with cytosolic (cyt) isoforms of ribulose-5-phosphate 3-epimerase (RPEase) and other non-oxidative branch enzymes being undetectable. Here we present for the first time the identification, cloning, and properties of a cyt-RPEase in rice (Oryza sativa) and presence of its homologues in other plant species.

Through breakdown of sugars in its oxidative branch, the OPPP generates reductant (NADPH) for fatty acid and amino acid synthesis. Enzymes of the reversible, non-oxidative branch of this pathway provide erythrose 4-phosphate for the shikimate pathway, the products of which are used for the synthesis of aromatic amino acids, flavonoids, and lignin, and ribose 5-phosphate for nucleic acid synthesis. The OPPP in the cytosol of yeast cells is vital for oxidative stress defense through supply of NADPH for the glutathione reductase (1.Slekar K.H. Kosman D.J. Culotta V.C. J. Biol.

Genet. 1996; 252: 456-464Crossref PubMed Scopus (182) Google Scholar). The chloroplast (chl) OPPP enzyme ribulose-5-phosphate 3-epimerase (RPEase, EC 5.1.3.1) was found to be critically involved in the early development of nematode feeding plant cells (3.Favery B. Lecomte P. Gil N. Bechtold N. Bouchez D. Dalmasso A. Abad P. EMBO J. 1998; 23: 6799-6811Crossref Scopus (76) Google Scholar). Since OPPP enzymes in animal and yeast cells are located exclusively in the cytosol, some textbooks propose an analogous location of this pathway in plant cells (4.Weier T.E. Stocking C.R. Barbour M.G. Rost T.L. Botany, An Introduction to Plant Biology. 6th Ed. John Wiley and Sons, New York1982Google Scholar, 5.Lüttge U. Kluge M. Bauer G. Botanik. WCH Verlagsgesellschaft, Weinheim1994Google Scholar, 6.Mohr H. Schopfer P. Pflanzenphysiologie. 4 th Ed. Springer-Verlag, Berlin1992Crossref Google Scholar). Reportedly, however, several essential OPPP enzymes could not be detected in the cytosol of plant leaf cells (7.Feierabend J. Gringel G. Z. Pflanzenphysiol. 1983; 110: 247-258Crossref Google Scholar, 8.Schnarrenberger C. Flechner A. Martin W. Plant Physiol. 1995; 108: 609-614Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar). On the other hand, chloroplasts and chromoplasts contain the components for a complete OPPP (9.Dennis D.T. Turpin D.H. Plant Physiology, Biochemistry and Molecular Biology. Longman Scientific and Technical, Singapore1990Google Scholar, 10.Thom E. Mühlmann T. Quick P.W. Camara B. Neuhaus H.-E. Planta (Basel). 1998; 204: 226-233Crossref Scopus (38) Google Scholar). Recently, nuclear-encoded genes for chloroplast enzymes with dual (amphibolic) function in the OPPP and reductive pentose phosphate cycle (Calvin cycle) have been cloned and characterized including transketolase (11.Teige M.

Relatively little is known about the occurrence, structure, and biochemistry of plant cytosolic (cyt) OPPP enzymes. Although cytosolic glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase and 6-phosphogluconate dehydrogenase have been isolated from green and non-green plant tissue (6.Mohr H. Schopfer P. Pflanzenphysiologie. 4 th Ed. Springer-Verlag, Berlin1992Crossref Google Scholar, 18.Schnarrenberger C. Oeser A. Tolbert N.E. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1973; 154: 438-448Crossref PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar), cytosolic isoforms of the non-oxidative branch OPPP enzymes transketolase, ribose-5-phosphate isomerase, and RPEase were undetectable in plant cell extracts by combined cell fractionation and enzyme chromatography experiments (7.Feierabend J. Gringel G. Z. Pflanzenphysiol. 1983; 110: 247-258Crossref Google Scholar, 8.Schnarrenberger C. Flechner A. Martin W. Plant Physiol. 1995; 108: 609-614Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar). Disregarding the possibility that cytosolic enzymes may have escaped from detection due to chromatographic properties similar to the chloroplast homologues, it has been proposed that spinach leaf cells contain a complete and incomplete OPPP in their chloroplasts and cytosol, respectively (8.Schnarrenberger C. Flechner A. Martin W. Plant Physiol. 1995; 108: 609-614Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar). To further address the important biochemical problem whether plant cells contain complete OPPP both inside and outside of their chloroplasts, we have attempted to identify and characterize non-chloroplastic enzymes of the non-oxidative branch of the OPPP. Cloning of chloroplast RPEase genes from potato and spinach (15.Teige M. Kopriva S. Bauwe H. Süss K.-H. FEBS Lett. 1995; 377: 349-352Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar, 16.Nowitzki U. Wyrich R. Westhoff P. Hense K. Schnarrenberger C. Martin W. Plant Mol. Biol. 1995; 29: 1279-1291Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar) opened up the way to search enzyme homologues. Here we report on the identification and cloning of a cyt-RPEase from rice, its heterologous and tissue-specific expression, properties, presence of homologues in other plant species, and its possible evolutionary origin. The cDNA clones encoding chloroplast RPEase-related proteins in rice were obtained form the MAFF DNA Bank, Tsukuba, Japan. Materials and vendors were as follows: transketolase, triose-phosphate isomerase, glycerophosphate dehydrogenase,d-ribose 5-phosphate, d-ribulose 5-phosphate, phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, lactate dehydrogenase, ATP, and NADH, Sigma; Bio-Spin columns, Bio-Rad; EcoRI, HindIII, and SacI restriction endonucleases, Roche Molecular Biochemicals. Oligonucleotide primers for polymerase chain reaction were synthetized by Microsynth GmbH, Balgach, Switzerland. The antisera against recombinant cytosolic RPEase were produced in Inselspital, Bern, Switzerland. The GenBank and EMBL sequence data bases were screened with the BLAST software for sequences related to the chloroplast RPEase from potato (15.Teige M. Kopriva S. Bauwe H. Süss K.-H. FEBS Lett. 1995; 377: 349-352Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). The sequences found were further analyzed by the PCGENE package (Intelligenetics). The cDNA clone encoding a putative cytosolic RPEase in rice, corresponding to GenBank accession number D41947, has been obtained from the MAFF DNA Bank, Tsukuba, Japan, and completely sequenced on both strands. The phylogenetic analysis of gene sequences was performed with the Treecon program (19.Van de Peer Y. De Wachter R. Comput. Appl. Biosci. 1993; 9: 177-182PubMed Google Scholar). A RPEase tree was constructed by the neighbor-joining method (20.Saitou N. Nei M. Mol. Biol. Evol. 1987; 4: 406-425PubMed Google Scholar) using the Dayhoff matrix and the statistical significance of the branches has been tested by bootstrap analysis with 100 replicates (21.Felsenstein J. Evolution. 1985; 39: 783-791Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). RNA was isolated from leaves, roots, and seedlings of rice by phenol extraction and LiCl precipitation. DNA was isolated from young leaves by phenol extraction and ethanol precipitation. Southern analysis of genomic DNA from Arabidopsis thaliana, Zea mays, and Oryza sativa and Northern blotting of the RNA isolated from rice tissues was performed as described (22.Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar). The blots were hybridized either with32P-labeled total cDNA of rice cyt-RPEase or chloroplast RPEase from Solanum tuberosum (15.Teige M. Kopriva S. Bauwe H. Süss K.-H. FEBS Lett. 1995; 377: 349-352Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). The two RPEase isoforms were expressed inEscherichia coli using the pET expression system (Novagen). The rice cyt-RPEase- and potato chl-RPEase (15.Teige M. Kopriva S. Bauwe H. Süss K.-H. FEBS Lett. 1995; 377: 349-352Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar) coding regions were cloned into pET3a and pET14b plasmids, the latter ensuring the addition of a 6-histidine tag at the N terminus of the expressed protein. To determine the extent of heterologous expression of recombinant RPEases in bacteria, RPEase activity measurements in extracts of bacteria carrying different expression constructs were performed. Cell-free extracts were prepared from overnight cultures of bacteria by sonication in phosphate-buffered saline prior to centrifugation at 20,000 × g for 10 min. Enzyme purification was performed at 4 °C, and all buffers were at pH 7.5. Cell paste (20 g) from 10 liters of culture was resuspended in 200 ml of a buffer containing 25 mmTricine-NaOH, pH 7.5, 1 mm EDTA, 10 mm NaCl, 0.01 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 10% glycerol, and 10 mm l-arginine. The slurry was sonicated for 20 min with intervals and ultracentrifuged at 20,000 ×g for 20 min. The supernatant was fractionated by addition of ammonium sulfate. The cyt-RPEase precipitated between 40 and 60% saturation of ammonium sulfate, whereas the chl-RPEase precipitated between 50 and 80% saturation of the salt. Protein was collected by centrifugation, desalted, and concentrated (Centriprep-30, Amicon). Protein solution was applied to a Mono-Q column (5/10) adapted to a fast protein liquid chromatography unit (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) which was pre-equilibrated with the above buffer. Enzymes were eluted with 70-ml linear gradient of 0 to 300 mm NaCl in equilibration buffer. Recombinant cyt-RPEase was resolved into two peaks that emerged at 0.12 (major peak) and 0.2 m NaCl. Recombinant chl-RPEase eluted at 0.14 and 0.22 m NaCl from the same column. Purification of both RPEases could be achieved as well by chromatography on a Ni2+-chelate column according to the manufacturer's instructions (Novagen), but the enzyme yield was usually much lower as compared with the conventional method. Enzyme solutions were concentrated and used immediately, or ammonium sulfate was added to yield 60 and 80% saturation for cytosolic and chloroplast RPEase, respectively, and stored at 4 °C. The molecular mass of the purified RPEases was determined by gel permeation chromatography on a fast protein liquid chromatography Superdex-S200 (HP, 16/60) column that had been pre-equilibrated with the buffer used for anion-exchange chromatography and calibrated with standard proteins as described previously (13.Teige M. Melzer M. Süss K.-H. Eur. J. Biochem. 1998; 252: 237-244Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). Protein concentration was determined with the Bio-Rad kit with bovine serum albumin as the standard. Ribulose-5-phosphate epimerase activity was determined spectrophotometrically at 340 nm, 25 °C, and pH 8.0 using a coupled enzyme assay (23.Williamson W.T. Wood W.A. Methods Enzymol. 1966; 9: 605-608Crossref Scopus (17) Google Scholar) in the presence of transketolase, triose-phosphate isomerase, glycerol-3-phosphate dehydrogenase, and ribulose-5-phosphate as described previously (13.Teige M. Melzer M. Süss K.-H. Eur. J. Biochem. 1998; 252: 237-244Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar, 15.Teige M. Kopriva S. Bauwe H. Süss K.-H. FEBS Lett. 1995; 377: 349-352Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). Antibodies were raised in rabbits against the recombinant rice cytosolic RPEase and potato chloroplast RPEase. SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and Western protein blotting were performed using standard procedures. Maize seedlings were grown for 2 weeks in hydroculture. Roots and leaves were washed extensively in distilled water, cut into small pieces, and homogenized in a buffer containing 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 1 mm EDTA, 5 mm MgCl2, 330 mm sorbitol, 1 mm sodium bisulfite with a Waring blender for 10 s at 4 °C. The slurry was filtered through 5 layers of cheesecloth and centrifuged at 1,000 ×g for 10 min to remove cell debris and nuclei. The supernatant was centrifuged at 20,000 × g for 10 min to spin down plastids and mitochondria, and the resulting supernatant was used as the crude cytosol fraction. To identify genes coding for ribulose-5-phosphate 3-epimerases that might be located in plant cell compartments other than the chloroplasts, a sequence homology search of the EMBL and GenBank data bases was undertaken with the potato chl-RPEase as a reference (15.Teige M. Kopriva S. Bauwe H. Süss K.-H. FEBS Lett. 1995; 377: 349-352Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). Two groups of EST entries were obtained from A. thaliana and rice (O. sativa) which were 65 and 45% identical to the nucleotide sequence of chl-RPEase. The 1-kilobase cDNA, reconstructed from the first group of rice RPEase sequences, coded for a 25-kDa protein (235 amino acids) 90% identical with the potato chl-RPEase and contained a presequence of 39 amino acids possessing all features of a chloroplast targeting peptide. The corresponding nuclear gene, therefore, most probably codes for rice chloroplast RPEase. The rice cDNA clones OSS4145a, OSS4976a, and OSR28401a (MAFF DNA Bank, Tsukuba, Japan) form the second group of chl-RPEase-related sequences and are identical to each other. The clone OSS4976a DNA was fully sequenced on both strands. The 942-base pair cDNA coded for a protein of 24.3 kDa (228 amino acids). The protein was only 40% identical in its primary structure with the rice and potato chl-RPEase, but possessed 52% identical residues with the cyt-RPEases from yeast (24.Miosga T. Zimmermann F.K. Curr. Genet. 1996; 30: 404-409Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar) and human (reconstructed from EST sequencesR98280, R53130, AA458563, AA373190, and AA380177) (Fig.1). Notably, human cyt-RPEase and rice chl-RPEase share only 36% identical residues. Moreover, there are only 27–35% identical amino acid positions in the primary structure of the novel rice RPEase and three homologous enzymes in E. coli(25.Lyngstadaas A. Lobner-Olesen A. Boye E. Mol. Gen. Genet. 1995; 247: 546-554Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar, 26.Blattner F.R. Plunkett III, G. Bloch C.A. Perna N.T. Burland V. Riley M. Collado-Vides J. Glasner J.D. Rode C.K.

The novel RPEase isoform from rice lacked a chloroplast targeting sequence indicating its localization in the cytosol. The EMBL data base was further searched for EST entries with high similarity to the novel rice RPEase. EST sequences from A. thaliana (T75815), poplar (27.Sterky F. Regan S. Karlsson J. Hertzberg M. Rohde A. Holmberg A. Amini B. Bhalerao R. Larsson M. Villarroel R. Van Montagu M. Sandberg G. Olsson O. Teeri T.T. Boerjan W. Gustafsson P. Uhlen M. Sundberg B. Lundeberg J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 13330-13335Crossref PubMed Scopus (375) Google Scholar), and pine xylem (28.Allona I. Quinn M. Shoop E. Swope K. St. Cyr S. Carlis J. Riedl J. Retzel E. Campbell M.M. Sederoff R. Whetten R.W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 9693-9698Crossref PubMed Scopus (277) Google Scholar) were retrieved that were 64 and 77% identical in their nucleotide and deduced amino acid sequence to the novel rice RPEase, respectively. The same sequences, however, shared only 49 and 36% identical nucleotide and amino acid residues with the chl-RPEases from rice, potato, andA. thaliana. Remarkably, the 5′-nontranslated region of the poplar EST clone (A061P33U) consists of 67 base pairs and possesses an in-frame stop codon upstream of the initial ATG codon indicating that it encodes a cytosolic rather than chloroplast enzyme. Accordingly, the homologous cDNA clones from rice, A. thaliana, and pine appear to code for non-chloroplast RPEases as well. Southern blot analysis was performed to determine the number of genes coding for the novel RPEase in rice, maize, and A. thaliana(Fig. 2, A and B). The analysis revealed 1–2 genes encoding this enzyme in the nuclear genome of these species, while only a single copy gene coding for chl-RPEase was detected in rice (Fig. 2 A). The latter finding corresponds with a previous report indicating that the spinach and Arabidopsis nuclear genomes contain a single copy gene for chl-RPEase (3.Favery B. Lecomte P. Gil N. Bechtold N. Bouchez D. Dalmasso A. Abad P. EMBO J. 1998; 23: 6799-6811Crossref Scopus (76) Google Scholar, 16.Nowitzki U. Wyrich R. Westhoff P. Hense K. Schnarrenberger C. Martin W. Plant Mol. Biol. 1995; 29: 1279-1291Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). These results indicate an ubiquitous distribution of the gene coding for putative cyt-RPEase in higher plants. A phylogenetic analysis was performed to investigate the evolutionary relationships between the known RPEase genes. RPEase sequences from 22 organisms 2Sources of RPEases compared in the phylogenetic analysis and GenBank accession numbers for their sequences are as follows: Mus musculus, AA162165, C88722; Homo sapiens, reconstructed from R98280, R53130, AA458563, AA373190, and AA380177; Drosophila melanogaster, AA247014 andAA392924; Caenorhabditis elegans, U28991;Saccharomyces cerevisiae, X83571; Saccharomyces pombe, Z98979; Mycobacterium tuberculosis, Z80108;Treponema pallidum, AE001263; Rhodobacter capsulatus, U23145; Alcaligenes euthropus, M64173;Hemeophilus influenzae, U32738; Serratia marcenses, X78415; E. coli, Z19601 and U14003;Bacillus subtilis, Y13937; Synechocystis sp.,D90911; S. tuberosum, Z50098; Spinacia oleracea, L42328; A. thaliana, AF015274; Aquifex aeolicus, AE000716; Methanococcus jannaschii, U67515; andHelicobacter pylori, AE001566. wereavailable at the time of this work. Three different RPEase related genes were found in E. coli. However, since disruption of therpe gene in the dam operon led to an impaired growth on minimal media, only the rpe gene was considered to be functional (25.Lyngstadaas A. Lobner-Olesen A. Boye E. Mol. Gen. Genet. 1995; 247: 546-554Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). Therefore the other E. coliRPEase-related genes were used as outgroups in the phylogenetic analysis. The analysis clearly revealed the existence of two different groups of RPEase genes in plants (Fig.3). Chloroplast RPEase of rice and other plant species are clustered and closely related to the cyanobacterial homologue from Synechocystis. Therefore, the nuclear gene encoding chl-RPEase was most likely acquired from the chloroplast ancestor and allocated to the plant nuclear genome through endosymbiotic gene transfer such as other genes coding for Calvin cycle enzymes (29.Martin W. Schnarrenberger C. Curr. Genet. 1997; 32: 1-18Crossref PubMed Scopus (201) Google Scholar). The other group of plant RPEases, however, is more closely related to the cytosolic enzyme homologues in yeast and animal cells than it is to any chl-RPEase. In striking analogy to the eubacterial origin of plant nuclear glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase genes (30.Martin W. Brinkmann H. Savonna C. Cerff R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 8692-8696Crossref PubMed Scopus (161) Google Scholar), this finding suggests that cyt-RPEase genes in the chimeric nuclear genomes originate from eubacteria and are not replaced by cyanobacterial homologues in the course of plant cell evolution. We predict, therefore, that algae also possess this RPEase gene. To compare the properties of the two types of plant RPEases, the cDNA clones coding for the cytosolic enzyme in rice and chloroplast isoform in potato (15.Teige M. Kopriva S. Bauwe H. Süss K.-H. FEBS Lett. 1995; 377: 349-352Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar) were overexpressed in E. coli with and without a N-terminal His-tag extension. Extracts of the E. coli transformed with the cDNA-containing vectors showed an about 6-fold higher RPEase activity than those from bacteria that had been transformed with pET14b alone (TableI). Cytosolic and chloroplast RPEases carrying the His-tag extensions were purified to homogeneity by affinity chromatography on Ni2+ columns and, alternatively, giving a higher yield, by fast protein liquid chromatography using an anion exchange Mono-Q column (HP5/10). Unexpectedly, both types of RPEases showed very similar chromatographic properties. The chloroplast and cytosolic enzyme eluted at 0.14 and 0.12 m NaCl, respectively, and a mixture of both proteins could not be resolved into single components. This finding may explain why only one rather than two different RPEase fraction have been detected in crude spinach leaf extracts as separated by anion-exchange chromatography (8.Schnarrenberger C. Flechner A. Martin W. Plant Physiol. 1995; 108: 609-614Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar). A striking difference between both enzyme isoforms was the tendency of the cytosolic enzyme to rapidly form aggregates in the course of purification. However, enzyme aggregation could be efficiently prevented in the presence of l-arginine which also enabled growth of enzyme crystals suitable for high resolution x-ray crystallography. 3K.-H. Süss, unpublished results. The His-tag extension apparently did not affect the activity of both types of RPEases in presence of l-arginine. No substantial differences were detected in the specific activity between freshly prepared recombinant cytosolic and chl-RPEases. At pH 8.0 and 25 °C, a V max for cytosolic and chl-RPEase of 16,000 and 16,500 units mg−1, respectively, was determined. A similar activity value was reported for recombinant chl-RPEase from spinach (31.Chen Y.-R. Hartman F.C. Lu T.-Y.S. Larimer F.W. Plant Physiol. 1998; 118: 199-207Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar). Gel permeation chromatography on a Sephacryl S-200 column in the presence of 0.2 m NaCl, in parallel with appropriate protein standards, yielded a M r of 55,000 for the cyt-RPEase, indicating a homodimeric subunit structure. In contrast, the recombinant potato chloroplast enzyme had aM r of 180,000 (17.Kopp J. Kopriva S. Süss K.-H. Schulz G.E. J. Mol. Biol. 1999; 287: 761-771Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). X-ray crystallography demonstrated, however, that the potato chl-RPEase is actually a homohexamer of 148,696 Da rather than an octamer (17.Kopp J. Kopriva S. Süss K.-H. Schulz G.E. J. Mol. Biol. 1999; 287: 761-771Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar).Table IRibulose-5-phosphate 3-epimerase activity in E. coli BL21 transformed with different RPEase expression constructsConstructRPEase activitymilliunits/min/mgpET14b1.08 ± 0.26Chl-RPEase/pET14b6.18 ± 0.09Chl-RPEase/pET3a6.06 ± 0.16Cyt-RPEase/pET14b6.8 ± 0.27Cyt-RPEase/pET3a5.81 ± 0.23The enzymatic activities were measured in duplicates on extracts of three independent bacterial overnight cultures.

Mean values ± S.D. are presented. Northern blot analysis of RNA prepared from rice tissues was performed to investigate, whether cytosolic and plastidic RPEase forms are expressed in a tissue-specific manner. These experiments showed that cyt-RPEase transcript is predominantly accumulated in roots and seedlings, whereas only a small amount of mRNA was detectable in leaves (Fig. 4). In contrast, chl-RPEase transcript was mainly expressed in leaves, and present only in minute quantities in seedlings and roots. The same pattern of transcript expression has been previously observed in potato organs (15.Teige M. Kopriva S. Bauwe H. Süss K.-H. FEBS Lett. 1995; 377: 349-352Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar) and is consistent with the low accumulation of chl-RPEase transcript in roots of A. thaliana (3.Favery B. Lecomte P. Gil N.

Western blotting of proteins prepared from the same rice tissues corroborated the results of RNA analysis for cyt-RPEase (Fig. 5), showing presence of this enzyme in all plant organs with maximum accumulation in root cells. Similar to the results of Teige et al. (15.Teige M. Kopriva S. Bauwe H. Süss K.-H. FEBS Lett. 1995; 377: 349-352Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar), chl-RPEase protein could not be detected in root tissue at all, although a low level of transcript was observed there. We also noted accumulation of a small amount of chl-RPEase in dark-grown seedlings even though the mRNA was hardly detectable by Northern blotting. This observation suggests that a post-transcriptional mechanism, but not light, is responsible for the tissue-specific accumulation of chl-RPEase. The reason why chloroplast transketolase, but not chl-RPEase, is accumulated at similar levels in roots and leaf mesophyll tissue (15.Teige M. Kopriva S. Bauwe H. Süss K.-H. FEBS Lett. 1995; 377: 349-352Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar), albeit carbon flux was observed to occur through the non-oxidative branch of OPPP in root proplastids (32.Bowsher C.G. Boulton E.L. Rose J. Nayagam S. Emes M.J. Plant J. 1992; 2: 893-898Crossref Scopus (123) Google Scholar), still remains to be elucidated.Figure 5Subcellular localization of cytosolic and plastidic RPEases in maize. The proteins from subcellular fractions of leaf chloroplasts (lane 1), leaf cytosol (lane 2), root proplastids (lane 3), and root cytosol (lane 4) were analyzed by Western blotting with antisera against recombinant cytosolic and chloroplast RPEase isoforms.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Although the lack of a chloroplast-targeting sequence, a homodimeric subunit structure, and a higher sequence similarity with homologous cytosolic enzymes in animals and yeast as compared with chloroplast epimerase suggested the location of the novel plant RPEase in the cytosol, cell fractionation experiments combined with Western blotting were conducted to prove that conjecture. The subcellular distribution of cyt-RPEase was investigated in root and leaf cells of which the subcellular fractions were obtained by differential centrifugation. Maize chloroplast and cyt-RPEases could be distinguished by Western blotting, because these enzymes are specifically cross-reacting with antibodies raised against the recombinant potato chl-RPEase and rice cyt-RPEase, respectively. Fig. 5shows that cyt-RPEase was exclusively present in the cytosol fraction of both root and leaf cells. As expected, chl-RPEase was undetectable in the subcellular fractions of root cells. However, in leaf cells, chl-RPEase was detected both in the isolated chloroplasts and the cytosol fraction. The latter enzyme fraction most probably originated from the stroma of osmotically broken chloroplasts contaminating the cytosol. These results thus support the conclusion that the novel plant RPEase isoform is a cytosolic rather than chloroplast enzyme. It has been proposed from combined cell fractionation and enzyme chromatography experiments that plant cells contain only an incomplete OPPP in the cytosol, because cytosolic isoforms of RPEase and other non-oxidative OPPP enzymes could not be detected (8.Schnarrenberger C. Flechner A. Martin W. Plant Physiol. 1995; 108: 609-614Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar). This work provides evidence for the presence of both cytosolic and chloroplast isoform of RPEase in rice and other plant species. The nuclear RPEase genes in rice could be divided into two groups due to their sequence similarity with chl-RPEase from potato and spinach. The rice chl-RPEase encoded by a single nuclear gene, as determined by Southern blotting, is 85% identical in the primary structure with homologous chloroplast enzymes from potato and spinach. The N-terminal amino acid residues 40–61 of the rice chl-RPEase precursor and the sequence determined from spinach chl-RPEase by N-terminal protein sequencing (13.Teige M. Melzer M. Süss K.-H. Eur. J. Biochem. 1998; 252: 237-244Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar) are identical, thus indicating that the first 39 N-terminal amino acids encoded by the rice gene represent a chloroplast targeting peptide. The second group of identical ESTs in rice also codes for a RPEase, because the cDNA expressed in E. coli led to the formation of a single enzyme that catalyzed the conversion of ribulose 5-phosphate to xylulose 5-phosphate. That this RPEase isoform most probably represents a cytosolic enzyme is indicated by different observations: (i) the equivalent enzyme in maize is present in the cytosol of leaf and root cells, (ii) the primary structure of the enzyme is more similar to cyt-RPEases from animals and yeast cells as compared with chloroplast enzyme homologues, (iii) the novel rice RPEase gene does not encode a chloroplast-targeting peptide, and (iv) the recombinant rice RPEase expressed in E. coli is a homodimer such as cyt-RPEase from yeast and human cell (23.Williamson W.T. Wood W.A. Methods Enzymol. 1966; 9: 605-608Crossref Scopus (17) Google Scholar, 33.Karmali A. Drake A.F. Spencer N. Biochem. J. 1983; 211: 617-623Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar), whereas the chl-RPEases are homohexamers (17.Kopp J. Kopriva S. Süss K.-H. Schulz G.E. J. Mol. Biol. 1999; 287: 761-771Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). Having deduced the function of amino acid residues from a high-resolution crystal structure of the wild-type and mutant chl-RPEases (17.Kopp J. Kopriva S. Süss K.-H. Schulz G.E. J. Mol. Biol. 1999; 287: 761-771Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar) as well as by site-directed mutagenesis (17.Kopp J. Kopriva S. Süss K.-H. Schulz G.E. J. Mol.

Chem. 1999; 274: 2132-2136Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar), it was interesting to analyze the conservation of these residues in the cytosolic and other RPEases. Only 17 amino acid residues are strictly conserved in all RPEases (Fig. 1), i.e. 7% of the 235 residues in spinach chl-RPEase. Among the invariant residues are Asp-43 and Asp-185 (sequence positions in mature spinach chl-RPEase), the two essential electrophiles catalyzing de- and reprotonation during pentose phosphate epimerization (17.Kopp J. Kopriva S. Süss K.-H. Schulz G.E. J. Mol. Biol. 1999; 287: 761-771Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar, 34.Chen Y.-R. Larimer F.W. Serpersu E.H. Hartman F.C. J. Biol.

Kopriva S. Süss K.-H. Schulz G.E. J. Mol. Biol. 1999; 287: 761-771Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). The evolutionary conservation of functionally essential residues not only indicates that all RPEases use the same mechanism of substrate conversion, but also indicates that the different genes coding for RPEases may be derived from the same ancestral gene. However, while the chloroplast enzyme is a hexamer, plant cyt-RPEase and homologue enzymes in animal and yeast cells (23.Williamson W.T. Wood W.A. Methods Enzymol. 1966; 9: 605-608Crossref Scopus (17) Google Scholar,33.Karmali A. Drake A.F. Spencer N. Biochem. J. 1983; 211: 617-623Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar) have a dimeric subunit structure. This conclusion is supported by a crystal structure analysis of the cytosolic enzyme at high resolution. 4S. Jelakovic and K.-H. Süss, unpublished results. Although the reason for the different subunit structure of chloroplast and cytosolic RPEases in plants is not obvious at present, one explanation may be that networking of metabolic pathways by complementary binding interactions between sequential enzymes requires more complex RPEase structures in chloroplast than in the cytosol of heterotrophic prokaryotes and eukaryotes. The location of the dual functional (amphibolic) chloroplast enzymes RPEase and transketolase and Calvin cycle enzymes adjacent to thylakoid membranes (13.Teige M. Melzer M. Süss K.-H. Eur. J. Biochem. 1998; 252: 237-244Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar, 35.Süss K.-H. Arkona C. Manteuffel R. Adler K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Marcel Dekker Inc., New York1997: 305-314Google Scholar) indicates that these catalysts are closely neighbored and may even form enzyme supercomplexes in vivo capable of catalyzing both the oxidative and reductive pentose phosphate pathway. An analogous situation of OPPP enzymes, albeit interacting with enzyme systems other than in plastids, might exist in the cytosol of plant cells. These results indicate that leaf mesophyll cells contain RPEase both in the cytosol and chloroplasts, whereas root cells apparently possess only cyt-RPEase, an enzyme active in the metabolically important non-oxidative branch of the OPPP. The gene coding for cyt-RPEase appears to be ubiquitously distributed in higher plants. Therefore, these observations cast doubts to a previous proposal (8.Schnarrenberger C. Flechner A. Martin W. Plant Physiol. 1995; 108: 609-614Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar) that leaf cells contain a complete OPPP in their chloroplasts and only an incomplete pathway in the cytosol due to the presence of glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase and 6-phosphogluconate dehydrogenase, but absence of enzymes active in the non-oxidative branch of this pathway. Although cyt-RPEase is not as abundant as its chloroplast counterpart in leaf cells, this does not disprove its potential metabolic importance. Although a search of DNA data bases did not provide evidence for cytosolic forms of transaldolase and ribose-5-phosphate isomerase, most likely due to the small number of data base entries, plants appear to possess cytosolic transketolase forms. A sequence comparison of the multiple transketolase genes inCraterostigma plantagineum (37.Bernacchia G. Schwall G. Lottspeich F. Salamini F. Bartels D. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 610-618Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar) with the potato chloroplast enzyme (11.Teige M. Kopriva S. Bauwe H. Süss K.-H. Plant Physiol. 1996; 112: 1735Crossref PubMed Scopus (4) Google Scholar) indicated that the cDNA clone tkt3 encodes a chloroplast enzyme form, whereas the clones tkt7 and tkt10 most likely coded for cytosolic tranketolases. 5S. Kopriva, unpublished results. It seems likely, therefore, that a complete OPPP operates both in chloroplasts and the cytosol of green plant cells as well as in the cytosol of non-green plant cells. The latter pathway is especially important biochemically, because root proplastids appear not to accumulate chloroplast RPEase, but root cells depend essentially on the use of sucrose supplied by leaf cells for the synthesis of proteins, nucleic acids, vitamins, and cell wall compounds.

Signals initiated following TCR and CD28 ligation include the stimulation of protein tyrosine kinases (PTKs), the generation of inositol triphosphate and diacylglycerol, the activation of protein kinase C (PKC), the increase in intracellular Ca2+, the activation of the Ras and Rho family of GTPases, and the activation of the mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) cascades (1.Qian D.

Stimulated MAPKs translocate from the cytoplasm to the nucleus where they phosphorylate and in turn activate transcription factors such as c-Fos and c-Jun. The increase in intracellular Ca2+ stimulates the serine/threonine phosphatase calcineurin, leading to the dephosphorylation of the transcription factor c-NAFT and in turn to its activation and translocation to the nucleus. Activated transcription factors bind to promoters of genes, leading to the initiation of gene transcription. In contrast to the extensive data available concerning the signals involved in promoting receptor function, much less is known about the mechanisms that down-regulate receptor signaling in T cells. There is evidence, however, implicating the serine/threonine kinase PKC in regulating receptor-initiated signaling in T cells. For example, PKC activation by PMA has been shown to modulate profoundly TCR- and CD28-mediated interleukin-2 production and T cell proliferation (4.Werlen G. Jacinto E. Xia Y. Karin M.

Interestingly, the effect of PKC stimulation by PMA in different types of cells, including T cells, is bidirectional; thus, the stimulation of PKC delivers a synergistic auxiliary signal for cell activation and a negative signal for down-regulating receptor function (4.Werlen G.

There is evidence implicating the focal adhesion PTKs Fak and Pyk2 in receptor-initiated activation of T cells.

Importantly, coligating CD28 and TCR increased the tyrosine phosphorylation of Pyk2, suggesting that this kinase may have a role in the costimulatory process in T cells (46.van Seventer G.A.

We show in the present article that PKC activation by PMA reverses receptor-induced tyrosine phosphorylation of the focal adhesion PTKs. PMA added to cells activated for 5 min by TCR or CD28 ligation led to the dephosphorylation of Pyk2 and Fak. In contrast, PMA did not affect TCR-induced tyrosine phosphorylation of CD3ζ and of the PTKs Fyn and Zap-70. However, PMA induced strong and rapid dephosphorylation of the linker molecule LAT. The dephosphorylation of the focal adhesion PTKs by PMA required PKC, as PMA failed to dephosphorylate proteins in PKC-depleted cells or in cells pretreated with the PKC inhibitor Ro-31-8220. The PTPase inhibitor orthovanadate completely abolished PMA-induced dephosphorylation of the focal adhesion PTKs, thereby suggesting a role for PTPases in the PMA effect. Together, the data implicate PKC in the regulation of receptor-induced tyrosine phosphorylation of the focal adhesion PTKs in T cells. Sodium orthovanadate, PMA, and 4α-phorbol were from Sigma. LumiGLO chemiluminescent substrate kit was purchased from Kirkegaard & Perry Laboratories (Gaithersburg, MD). Ro-31-8220 was obtained from Calbiochem. Anti-Zap-70 mAb, anti-PTP1C mAb, and anti-PTP1D mAb were obtained from Transduction Laboratories (Lexington, KY). Anti-CD3ζ mAb and anti-Fyn mAb were from Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc.

Human peripheral blood lymphocytes were isolated from healthy volunteers on Ficoll-Paque, washed with RPMI containing 10% fetal calf serum, and were then incubated with goat anti-human IgG-coated Immulan beads according to the manufacturer's recommendations. Unbound cells (T cells) were collected, and contaminating adherent cells were removed by incubating the cells in a tissue culture flask for 30 min at 37 oC. T cell purity was at least 98% as determined by flow cytometry (49.Fechner J.H.J. Vargo D.J. Geissler E.K. Graeb C. Wang J. Hanaway M.J. Watkins D.I. Piekarczyk M. Neville D.M.J. Knechtle S.J.

Acute human T cell leukemia (Jurkat) cells, clone E6-1, were obtained from American Type Culture Collection (Manassas, VA). Cells were maintained in suspension in complete medium (RPMI supplemented with 10% heat-inactivated fetal calf serum, 4 mm l-glutamine, and antibiotic/antimycotic mixture) at 37 °C in 5% CO2and were subcultured 3 times per week. T cell activation was done as reported previously with some modification (39.Hamawy M.M. Mergenhagen S.E. Siraganian R.P. J. Biol.

To examine the effect of activating PKC on receptor-initiated protein tyrosine phosphorylation, cells were incubated with 1 μg/ml anti-CD3 mAb or 3 μg/ml anti-CD28 mAb, and the tubes were placed in a 37 °C water bath for 5 min. At 5 min, cells were either lysed immediately, were treated with media only, or were treated with media containing PMA (50 ng/ml, final concentration). The incubation was then resumed for the indicated time at 37 °C. For analysis of proteins in whole cell lysates (WCL), cells were lysed with boiling SDS-PAGE sample buffer (final concentration: 75 mm Tris-HCl, pH 6.8, 2% SDS, 10% glycerol). For immunoprecipitation studies, cells were lysed with ice-cold lysis buffer (final concentrations: 10 mmTris-HCl, pH 7.5, 1% Triton X-100, 0.5% sodium deoxycholic acid, 50 mm NaCl, 50 mm NaF, 2 mmNa3VO4, 0.5 unit/ml aprotinin, and 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride). To study the effects of the PTPase inhibitor orthovanadate and the PKC inhibitor Ro-31-8220, T cells were pretreated with these drugs at 37 °C for 30 and 90 min, respectively, and then stimulated with anti-CD3 mAb as above.

After incubation, the beads were pelleted by centrifugation and washed with ice-cold solubilization buffer. The primary Ab was then added to the beads followed by the addition of cell lysates from 6 × 106 cells. The mixture was gently rotated for 2 h at 4 °C. After incubation, the beads were pelleted by centrifugation and washed 5× with ice-cold solubilization buffer. After the final centrifugation, the beads were resuspended in 2× SDS-PAGE sample buffer and boiled for 5 min. Immunoblotting was as described previously (39.Hamawy M.M. Mergenhagen S.E.

To investigate whether PKC regulates TCR-induced tyrosine phosphorylation of the focal adhesion PTKs in T cells, we examined the effect of the PKC activator PMA on receptor-induced tyrosine phosphorylation of these PTKs. Thus, we stimulated purified normal resting human T cells and Jurkat T cells with anti-CD3 mAb for 5 min to allow proteins to become tyrosine-phosphorylated and then added PMA. As previously reported, stimulating normal resting human T cells (Fig.1 A) or Jurkat T cells (Fig.1 B) with anti-CD3 mAb for 5 min induced protein tyrosine phosphorylation, determined by blotting WCL with anti-phosphotyrosine mAb. Interestingly, the addition of PMA to the cells in the continuous presence of the mAb for an additional 5 min (Fig. 1, A andB, compare lanes 3 and 4) or 10 min (Fig. 1, A and B, compare lanes 5 and6) markedly decreased the phosphorylation of certain proteins. In normal human T cells and in Jurkat T cells tyrosine phosphorylation of a 110-, a 70-, and a 40-kDa protein was reproducibly and most prominently affected by PMA. The dephosphorylation of the proteins was rapid and strong, as it was apparent within 5 min of the addition of PMA and was marked at 10 min. PMA effect was dose-dependent and was not mimicked by the biologically inactive 4α-phorbol (Fig. 1 C, compare lanes 7and 8). To examine the effect of PKC activation on receptor-induced tyrosine phosphorylation of Pyk2 and Fak, Jurkat T cells were stimulated with anti-CD3 mAb for 5 min and then treated with PMA as described above. Pyk2 and Fak were immunoprecipitated and transferred to membranes, and the membranes were then immunoblotted with anti-phosphotyrosine mAb or with the specific antibodies. As reported previously, ligating CD3 with a mAb increased tyrosine phosphorylation of Pyk2 and Fak (Fig.2, A and B, upper panel). Such phosphorylation declined with time after receptor ligation, reaching background values within 30–60 min (not shown). Strikingly, the addition of PMA to cells already stimulated for 5 min with anti-CD3 mAb almost completely reversed Pyk2 and Fak tyrosine phosphorylation (Fig. 2, A and B, comparelanes 3 and 4). The dephosphorylation of Pyk2 and Fak by PMA was rapid and strong, as the phosphorylation of the PTKs was markedly reduced within 5 min of the addition of PMA. Reprobing the membranes with anti-Pyk2 mAb (Fig. 2 A, lower panel) or anti-Fak mAb (Fig. 2 B, lower panel) showed equal amounts of proteins in all lanes, ruling out the possibility that incubating the cells with PMA induced a selective degradation of the PTKs. Following TCR ligation, Src PTKs (including Fyn) are rapidly activated, leading to the phosphorylation of the tyrosine residues in the CD3ζ subunit of TCR and to the subsequent activation of the PTK ZAP-70. To examine whether PKC activation under the same conditions that lead to the dephosphorylation of the focal adhesion PTKs also regulates tyrosine phosphorylation of molecules phosphorylated early in the TCR signaling cascade, Jurkat T cells were activated for 5 min with anti-CD3 mAb and then treated with PMA. Proteins were then immunoprecipitated from cell lysates and examined for tyrosine phosphorylation by blotting with anti-phosphotyrosine mAb (Fig. 3, A–C, upper panels). As shown in Fig. 3 A, Fyn was strongly tyrosine-phosphorylated in unstimulated cells, and its phosphorylation increased only modestly upon CD3 aggregation. PMA treatment did not appear to affect the receptor-induced tyrosine phosphorylation of Fyn (Fig. 3 A, compare lanes 3 and 4), although a slight decrease was seen in some experiments. Similarly, PMA did not affect tyrosine phosphorylation of CD3ζ, as at 10 min there was no difference in the tyrosine phosphorylation of CD3ζ in cells treated with or without PMA (Fig. 3 B, compare lanes 3 and 4). In contrast to CD3ζ and Fyn, Zap-70 was not tyrosine-phosphorylated in unstimulated cells (Fig. 3 C). Ligating CD3 markedly increased the tyrosine phosphorylation of the PTK. PMA addition to cells stimulated for 5 min with anti-CD3 mAb failed to dephosphorylate Zap-70, as the extent of Zap-70 tyrosine phosphorylation in untreated or in PMA-treated cells was similar (Fig.3 C, compare lanes 3 and 4). The failure of PMA to induce the dephosphorylation of CD3ζ, Fyn, and Zap-70 strongly suggests that PKC activation does not lead to general, nonspecific regulation of receptor signaling. PMA strongly and reproducibly dephosphorylated ∼40-kDa proteins (Fig. 1). Recently, a 36–40-kDa linker molecule has been identified as LAT (Linker for Activation ofT cells), which becomes tyrosine-phosphorylated upon TCR and CD28 ligation (48.Tsuchida M. Manthei E.R. Knechtle S.J. Hamawy M.M. Eur. J. Immunol. 1999; 29: 2354-2359Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar, 50.Zhang W. Sloan-Lancaster J. Kitchen J. Trible R.P. Samelson L.E. Cell. 1998; 92: 83-92Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1071) Google Scholar). Thus, we examined whether PMA down-regulates receptor-induced LAT phosphorylation. As previously reported, ligating CD3 with a mAb increased tyrosine phosphorylation of LAT (Fig. 3 D, upper panel). Notably, the addition of PMA to cells already stimulated for 5 min with anti-CD3 mAb almost completely reversed LAT tyrosine phosphorylation (Fig. 3 D, comparelanes 3 and 4). The dephosphorylation of LAT by PMA was rapid and strong, as the phosphorylation of LAT was markedly reduced within 5 min of the addition of PMA. Reprobing the membranes with anti-LAT mAb (Fig. 3 D, lower panel) showed equal amounts of proteins in all lanes, ruling out the possibility that incubating the cells with PMA induced a degradation of the molecule. PKC is the intracellular receptor for PMA and therefore is implicated in mediating PMA effects on cells. PMA is a diacetylglycerol analogue that can permeate biological membranes and directly bind to a cysteine-rich region on PKC that is physiologically recognized by diacylglycerol, leading to the sustained activation of the kinase. To confirm further the role of PKC in mediating the down-regulation by PMA of receptor signaling, cells were depleted of PKC by incubating for 16 h with 400 nm PMA. Such treatment effectively reduces Ca2+-dependent and Ca2+-independent PKC (Fig. 4 A). As shown in Fig. 4 B, ligating CD3 in PKC-depleted cells induced an increase in protein tyrosine phosphorylation. Impo"

Landes Co., New York1995: 255-279Google Scholar). The molecular mechanism of transcription regulation by CRP depends on the position of its binding site on the promoter sequence. Promoters that have the CRP-binding site centered between positions −60 and −100 usually require α-CTD for activation (3.Ishihama A. Nucleic Acids Mol.

Random and site-directed mutagenesis within α-CTD revealed that the amino acid residues responsible for interaction with the UP element in rrnBP1 include Leu-260, Leu-262, Arg-265, Asn-268, Cys-269, and Lys-297, whereas Leu-260, Leu-262, Arg-265, Asn-268, Leu-270, Ile-275, Lys-297, and Lys-298 are involved in transcription activation at thelacP1 promoter by CRP (14.Zou C.

The amino acid residues mostly important for UP element-dependent transcription (Leu-262, Arg-265, Asn-268, and Lys-297) are also crucial for CRP-dependent activation. Two possibilities are considered to explain this overlapping: (i) the same surface of α-CTD participates in the specific interaction with both the DNA UP element and CRP, or (ii) CRP ensures the contact between the specific surface of α-CTD and promoter DNA. These two possibilities are not necessarily contradictory if one α-subunit is involved in interaction with CRP while another forms a specific contact with DNA, or if α-CTD participates in an initial and transient interaction with CRP prior to the final and stable interaction with DNA. To get insight into the detailed mechanism of α-CTD interactions with the DNA UP element and CRP, we tried in this study to monitor CRP-induced conformational alterations in α-CTD upon transition from RNA polymerase-promoter binary complexes to ternary complexes. For this purpose, a set of single Cys mutant α-subunits at residues 263, 271, 272, 283, 285, 292, and 309 was constructed in addition to the Cys-269 mutant that was used in our previous studies (17.Ozoline O.N.

Using the reconstituted RNA polymerase holoenzymes containing the FMA-tethered mutant α-subunits, the fluorescent spectral changes were monitored after complex formation with the CRP-dependent promoteruxuAB, the factor-independent promoter T7D, and the UP element-dependent promoter rrnBP1. The topology of DNA contact surfaces was further studied by the recently developed approach employing a cutting reagent, FeBABE (19.Murakami K. Kimura M. Owens J.T. Meares C.F. Ishihama A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 1709-1714Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar, 20.Owens J.T. Chmura A.J. Murakami K. Fujita N. Ishihama A. Meares C.F.

EMBO J. 1999; 18: 4049-4059Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar), tethered at the critical Cys-269, Cys-272, and Cys-309. The results herein described show that within the RNA polymerase-promoter binary complexes with uxuAB and T7D promoters, the α-subunit of RNA polymerase make contacts with the upstream DNA, and this interaction involves Cys-309 on α-CTD helix IV rather than helix I, which is crucial for UP element-dependent transcription (15.Murakami K. Fujita N. Ishihama A. EMBO J. 1995; 15: 4358-4367Crossref Scopus (105) Google Scholar, 16.Gaal T. Ross W. Blatter E.E. Tang H. Jia X. Krishnan V.V. Assa-Munt N. Ebright R.H. Gourse R.L. Genes Dev. 1996; 10: 16-26Crossref PubMed Scopus (170) Google Scholar). Upon ternary complex formation in the presence of cAMP/CRP, both Cys-269 and Cys-272 approach the promoter DNA as in the case of rrnBP1 UP element interaction (15.Murakami K. Fujita N. Ishihama A. EMBO J. 1995; 15: 4358-4367Crossref Scopus (105) Google Scholar, 16.Gaal T. Ross W. Blatter E.E. Tang H. Jia X. Krishnan V.V. Assa-Munt N. Ebright R.H. Gourse R.L. Genes Dev. 1996; 10: 16-26Crossref PubMed Scopus (170) Google Scholar), indicating a conformational rearrangement in the topology of the DNA contact surface in α-CTD. Eight mutant derivatives of the rpoA gene were used in this study. One mutant, bearing the single Cys residue at its native position, 269, was constructed previously (17.Ozoline O.N. Murakami K. Negishi T. Fujita N. Ishihama A. Proteins Struct. Funct. Genet. 1998; 30: 183-192Crossref PubMed Scopus (3) Google Scholar, 18.Ozoline O.N. Fujita N. Murakami K. Ishihama A. Eur. J. Biochem. 1998; 253: 371-381Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar), whereas seven were prepared in this study by the overlapping polymerase chain reaction mutagenesis method (22.Ito W. Ishiguro H. Kurosawa Y. Gene (Amst.). 1991; 102: 67-70Crossref PubMed Scopus (261) Google Scholar). Two synthetic oligonucleotides (CGGAAGAAGATGAGCGCCCAATCGG and CCGTCTGCTGGTGACGCATGCTACAGCCCT) were used as forward primers, and seven species of oligonucleotides (GCTTGCGAAACGCGGGCCCAGTTCG, GCGTTAGCAGAGCGGAC(GCA)CAATTCCAGATCGT (T263C), GGATAGCTTCTGC(GCA)AAGAGCGTTAGCAGAGCGGA (L271C), GTGGATAGCTTC(GCA)TTTAAGAGCGTTAGCAGAGCGG (A272C), GCTCAACCTCGGTACG(GCA)TACCAGATCACCGA (Q283C), GGAGCTCAACCTC(GCA)ACGCTGTACCAGA (T285C), CCAAGGTTAGG(GCA)TTTAAGGAGCTCAACCT (T292C), and GAGACAGTCCACG(GCA)AGCCAGCACG (S309C) were used as reverse primers. Each of these reverse primers bears the substitution at a desired position. Plasmid pGEMA54A131A176A269A, encoding the Cys-free α-subunit (17.Ozoline O.N. Murakami K. Negishi T. Fujita N. Ishihama A. Proteins Struct. Funct. Genet. 1998; 30: 183-192Crossref PubMed Scopus (3) Google Scholar), was used as a parent plasmid. All mutant constructions were checked by DNA sequencing performed with a DSQ-1000L DNA sequencer (Shimadzu, Kyoto, Japan). Plasmids that have no polymerase chain reaction-generated mismatches in other positions were selected for expression of the single Cys mutant α-subunits inEscherichia coli BL21(DE3). Eight single Cys mutant α-proteins (bearing a Cys residue at position 263, 269, 271, 272, 283, 285, 292, or 309) and the Cys-free mutant α-subunit (Cys−) were purified according to Fujita and Ishihama (23.Fujita N. Ishihama A. Methods Enzymol. 1997; 273: 121-130Crossref Google Scholar) from insoluble fractions of overexpressed cell lysates using an HPLC system with a Poros HQ/H column (4.6 × 100 mm; PerSeptive Biosystems). The mutant α-subunit devoid of CTD up to residue 235 (α235) was prepared from the soluble fraction of the cell lysate by the standard procedure (9.Igarashi K. Ishihama A. Cell. 1991; 65: 1015-1022Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (268) Google Scholar). The purity of all proteins was >95% as judged by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. The synthesis and spectral and chemical characteristics of FMA are described elsewhere (17.Ozoline O.N. Murakami K. Negishi T. Fujita N. Ishihama A. Proteins Struct. Funct. Genet. 1998; 30: 183-192Crossref PubMed Scopus (3) Google Scholar, 24.Ozoline O.N. Uteshev T.A. Kamzolova S.G. Biochim. Biophys.

Acta. 1993; 1172: 251-261Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). Since a mercaptide bond is unstable in the presence of thiol compounds, DTT was removed from all protein samples by gel filtration through a Sephadex G-50 column (1 × 8 cm). Elution buffer contained 10 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.0 at 4 °C), 1 mm EDTA, 10 mm MgCl2, 0.3 m KCl, and 10% glycerol. Chemical modification was carried out by mixing the DTT-free samples of the wild-type or mutant derivatives of the α-subunit with a 10-fold excess of FMA dissolved in 10 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.0 at 4 °C). The reaction was allowed to proceed for 30 min at room temperature and then for 30 min at 4 °C. Unreacted FMA was removed by gel filtration in the same buffer. Conjugation of FeBABE to the single Cys α-subunit mutants was carried out essentially according to published procedures (19.Murakami K. Kimura M. Owens J.T. Meares C.F. Ishihama A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 1709-1714Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar, 20.Owens J.T. Chmura A.J. Murakami K. Fujita N. Ishihama A. Meares C.F. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 7670-7675Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). In brief, conjugation was initiated by mixing 250 μl of 40 μmprotein solution in 20 mm MOPS (pH 8.0 at 37 °C), 10 mm MgCl2, 0.2 m KCl, 0.1 mm EDTA, and 6 m urea with 3.4 μl of 30 mm FeBABE solution in dimethyl sulfoxide. The reaction was carried out at 37 °C for 1 h and then terminated by adding 250 μl of 1 m Tris-HCl (pH 8.0). Unconjugated FeBABE was removed by gel filtration through a Sephadex G-50 column (1 × 8 cm) in the same buffer. The β-, β′-, and ς-subunits were purified from overexpressed E. coli as described previously (23.Fujita N. Ishihama A. Methods Enzymol. 1997; 273: 121-130Crossref Google Scholar). The reconstitution of core enzyme was carried out using the purified β- and β′-subunits and either modified or unmodified α-subunits according to the standard procedure (23.Fujita N. Ishihama A. Methods Enzymol. 1997; 273: 121-130Crossref Google Scholar). Assembled RNA polymerase was separated from unassembled subunits and subassemblies by chromatography on a heparin-agarose column (HiTrapTM, Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) in an HPLC system. Proteins were eluted with a linear gradient of 0–1.5 m NaCl in 0.01m Tris-HCl (pH 8.0), 1 mm EDTA, and 5% glycerol, giving the protein peaks in the order of α-dimer, α2β, and core enzyme with the increase in NaCl concentration. Peak fractions containing the reconstituted core enzyme were pooled, dialyzed against storage buffer (10 mmTris-HCl (pH 7.8), 10 mm MgCl2, 0.2m KCl, 50% glycerol, and 0.1 mm EDTA), and stored at −30 or −80 °C until use. Holoenzyme was prepared by adding purified DTT-free ς70 to the reconstituted core enzyme at a molar ratio of 4:1. Transcription activity was tested under the conditions of single-round transcription as described previously (9.Igarashi K. Ishihama A. Cell. 1991; 65: 1015-1022Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (268) Google Scholar, 26.Kajitani M. Ishihama A. Nucleic Acids Res. 1983; 11: 671-686Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). In brief, the formation of open complexes was performed in the preincubation mixture containing, in 35 μl the following: 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.0 at 37 °C), 3 mmmagnesium acetate, 50 mm NaCl, 25 μg/ml nuclease-free bovine serum albumin, template DNA, and RNA polymerase. Transcription was carried out under template excess conditions to detect changes in the enzyme activity with the maximum sensitivity. The templates used were as follows: a 207-bp EcoRI fragment of plasmid pKB252 carrying the lacL8UV5 promoter (lacL8UV5 transcript, 68 bases) (26.Kajitani M. Ishihama A. Nucleic Acids Res. 1983; 11: 671-686Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar), a 1-kilobase pairPstI-XhoI fragment of pFA4S carrying theuxuAB promoter (uxuAB transcript, 169 bases) (9.Igarashi K. Ishihama A. Cell. 1991; 65: 1015-1022Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (268) Google Scholar), and a 375-bp fragment containing promoter T7D (T7D transcript, 224 bases) (27.Masulis I.S. Chasov V.V. Kostyanicina E.G. Ozoline O.N. Mol. Biol. (Mosc.). 1998; 32: 598-602PubMed Google Scholar). Both plasmid pSLUP carrying the wild-typerrnBP1 promoter and its 226-bp XhoI fragment promoted the synthesis of the 56-base RNA product (11.Murakami K. Owens J.T. Belyaeva T.A. Meares C.F. Busby S.J.W. Ishihama A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 11274-11278Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). The mixture was incubated for 30 min at 37 °C for open complex formation with thelacL8UV5 and uxuAB promoters, and at both 22 and 37 °C for open complex formation with the T7D promoter. Open complex formation with rrnBP1 and rrnBP1(SUB) was carried out at 22 °C and in the presence of ATP and CTP for stabilization of the open complexes formed (16.Gaal T. Ross W. Blatter E.E. Tang H. Jia X. Krishnan V.V. Assa-Munt N. Ebright R.H. Gourse R.L. Genes Dev. 1996; 10: 16-26Crossref PubMed Scopus (170) Google Scholar). To monitor CRP-dependent transcription at uxuAB, 100 nm CRP and 10 μm cAMP were added to the preincubation mixture. CRP was expressed using plasmid pH7 and purified according to Aiba et al. (28.Aiba H. Fujimoto S. Ozaki N. Nucleic Acids Res. 1982; 10: 1345-1361Crossref PubMed Scopus (211) Google Scholar). Transcription was initiated by adding 15 μl of a prewarmed substrate/heparin mixture in the same buffer to make the final concentrations as follows: 160 μm each ATP, GTP, and CTP; 50 μm [α-32P]UTP (2 μCi/reaction); and 200 μg/ml heparin. RNA synthesis was allowed to proceed for 15 min at 37 °C (uxuAB and lacL8UV5) or 22 °C (rrnBP1 and rrnBP1(SUB)) and terminated by adding 50 μl of stopping solution (40 mm EDTA and 200 μg/ml yeast tRNA). RNA was precipitated with ethanol and analyzed by 5–8% polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis in the presence of 8 murea. Gels were exposed to imaging plates, and the plates were analyzed with a BAS2000 BioImage analyzer (Fujix, Tokyo). FMA-modified core enzymes were dialyzed against transcription buffer (10 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.0 at 37 °C), 3 mm Mg-acetate, 50 mm NaCl, 5% glycerol, 0.1 mm EDTA, and 25 μg/ml bovine serum albumin) and used for spectral measurements. For spectral characterization of RNA polymerase-promoter complexes, 50 nm FMA-modified RNA polymerase in 320 μl of transcription buffer was first incubated at 32 °C for 10 min, and emission spectra were recorded in the absence and presence of polarizer set in different orientations. After the addition of the first portion of promoter-containing DNA fragment, the mixtures were incubated at 32 °C for 5 min, and spectral measurements were carried out. This cycle of DNA addition, 5 min of incubation, and spectral measurements were repeated four times, each time with an increased molar ratio of DNA fragment to enzyme usually up to 1.5. To prevent nonspecific absorption of the RNA polymerase to the surface of cuvettes, bovine serum albumin was added to the sample. Since the size ofuxuAB DNA fragment used was large, the concentration of FMA-modified RNA polymerase was reduced to 25 nm. The monitoring of RNA polymerase-CRP interaction was carried out essentially according to the same protocol, until the final concentration of CRP reached 200 nm (CRP/RNA polymerase ratio of 4). For the spectral measurements of CRP·DNA·RNA polymerase ternary complexes, CRP·DNA binary complexes were allowed to form for 15 min at 32 °C in the presence of cAMP and then added to the FMA-modified RNA polymerase in four portions. To follow the rrnBP1 promoter-induced alterations in the conformation of α-CTD, titration with the promoter DNA was performed in the absence and presence of increasing concentrations of the initiating substrates ATP and CTP, which are required for stabilization of the open complex. The two initiating nucleotides were added five times to increase the ATP and CTP concentrations stepwise up to 160 nm. By stepwise addition of these substrates, the amplitude of spectral changes increased gradually. The temperature of 32 °C was optimized to avoid the denaturation of the RNA polymerase during the prolonged time of spectral measurements (∼40 min for one cycle of the measurement). The fluorescence emission spectra were monitored using a Hitachi Model F4500 spectrofluorometer equipped with a thermo-controlled cuvette. Five-nm slits were used both for excitation at 480 nm and measurements of emitted light. Polarization anisotropy (A) was calculated by the following standard formula: A = (I 0–0 −GI 0–90)/(I 0–0 + 2G 0–90), where G =I 90–0/I 90–90, andI 0–0, I 0–90,I 90–0, and I 90–90 are the emission intensities registered at λmax using different orientations of polarizers. The DNA cleavage reaction induced by protein-bound FeBABE was carried out as described in our previous studies (19.Murakami K. Kimura M. Owens J.T. Meares C.F. Ishihama A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 1709-1714Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar, 20.Owens J.T. Chmura A.J. Murakami K. Fujita N. Ishihama A. Meares C.F. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 7670-7675Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). In brief, the reconstituted core enzymes containing FeBABE-modified α-subunits were dialyzed against DNA cleavage buffer (40 mm HEPES (pH 8.0), 10 mmMgCl2, 0.1 m KCl, 0.1 mm EDTA, and 5% glycerol) without DTT and stored at −80 °C until use. For DNA cleavage, mixtures of 32P-end-labeled DNA fragments (6 nm) and FeBABE-conjugated RNA polymerase (20 nm) were incubated at 37 °C for 10 min in 90 μl of DNA cleavage buffer in the absence and presence of CRP (100 nm) and cAMP (10 μm). To remove nonspecifically bound RNA polymerase, salmon sperm DNA (40 μg/ml final concentration) was added 0.5 min before the start of the DNA cleavage reaction. The cleavage reaction was initiated by the addition of sodium ascorbate (pH 7.0; 2 mm final concentration) and hydrogen peroxide (1 mm final concentration) and then allowed to proceed at 37 °C for 20 min before quenching with 0.1 m thiourea and 100 μg/ml sonicated salmon sperm DNA. After dilution with Tris/EDTA buffer up to 200 μl, DNA was extracted with phenol/chloroform, precipitated with ethanol, and analyzed by electrophoresis on 8% polyacrylamide gel containing 8 murea. Bands were visualized with the BAS2000 BioImage analyzer. The templates used were the 216-bp uxuAB fragment carrying the promoter (from −133 to +83) and the 213-bp fragment bearing the T7D promoter region (from −131 to +82). Both fragments were prepared by polymerase chain reaction using 32P-end-labeled primers: [5′-32P]CCCGGGGATCAATAACC (top strand ofuxuAB), [5′-32P]GAGACGCGGAACCCTGG (bottom strand of uxuAB), [5′-32P]GGCTAACAACAAGGCGTC (top strand of T7D), and [5′-32P]GTGTCCCTCTGTGTCCC (bottom strand of T7D). Previously, we constructed the single Cys mutant α-subunit derivative bearing Cys only at its natural position, 269 (17.Ozoline O.N. Murakami K. Negishi T. Fujita N. Ishihama A. Proteins Struct. Funct. Genet. 1998; 30: 183-192Crossref PubMed Scopus (3) Google Scholar). In addition, we constructed in this study a set of mutant α-subunit derivatives carrying a single Cys residue after replacement by Cys of Thr-263, Lys-271, Ala-272, Gln-283, Thr-285, Thr-292, or Ser-309, starting with the Cys-null α-subunit mutant possessing all four Cys residues substituted with Ala (C54A, C131A, C176A, and C269A) (17.Ozoline O.N. Murakami K. Negishi T. Fujita N. Ishihama A. Proteins Struct. Funct. Genet. 1998; 30: 183-192Crossref PubMed Scopus (3) Google Scholar). The site of Cys substitution was chosen so as to preserve the activities of the α-subunit by avoiding mutagenesis of amino acid residues generally crucial for biological activities and by replacing amino acid residues that are similar in chemical nature to Cys (with the exception of Lys-271). We tried to replace Lys-271 because it is located on the surface of helix I, which is essential for transcription activation by the UP element and CRP. All these mutant α-subunits were overexpressed, purified, modified with FMA, and reconstituted into the mutant holoenzymes. The efficiency of core enzyme assembly by the mutant α-subunits was essentially the same as that by the wild-type α-subunit, in agreement with the finding that the contact surfaces on the α-subunit for RNA polymerase assembly are all located within the N-terminal domain (8.Ishihama A. J. Bacteriol. 1993; 175: 2483-2489Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 9.Igarashi K. Ishihama A. Cell. 1991; 65: 1015-1022Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (268) Google Scholar). The functional activity of wild-type and mutant RNA polymerases was analyzed using a single-round transcription assay directed by the UP element-dependent promoter rrnBP1 (Fig.1, A and B), the CRP-dependent promoter uxuAB (Fig.1 D), and the control promoter T7D (Fig. 1 C). ThelacL8UV5 promoter was always added to the transcription mixture as an internal reference. Fig. 1 A shows one example of the gel electrophoresis pattern of rrnBP1 transcript by eight different species of the mutant RNA polymerases, each containing a different single Cys mutant α-subunit (lanes 4–11), together with transcripts by the enzymes containing the wild-type α-subunit (lane 1), the Cys-null mutant α-subunit (lane 2), and the C-terminal deletion mutant α235 (lane 3). The level of lacL8UV5 transcription stayed almost constant for all 11 RNA polymerases because transcription of lacL8UV5 without the UP element was virtually unaffected by the presence or absence of α-CTD (9.Igarashi K. Ishihama A. Cell. 1991; 65: 1015-1022Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (268) Google Scholar). After correction for the experimental fluctuations based on the intensity of thelacL8UV5 transcript, the levels of transcription activity of the mutant RNA polymerases relative to those of the wild-type enzyme were calculated for each template (Fig. 1, B,rrnBP1; C, T7D; and D,uxuAB). The activities of the mutant RNA polymerase containing α235, devoid of the C-terminal 84 residues, in transcription directed by UP element-dependent rrnBP1 (Fig. 1, A,lane 3; and B, bar 3) and by cAMP/CRP-dependent uxuAB (Fig. 1 D,bar 3) were <20 and ∼25%, respectively, of the level of wild-type RNA polymerase, in confirmation of the concept that α-CTD is required for both UP element- and class I factor-dependent transcription (4.Ross W. Gosink K.K. Salomon K.I. Zou C. Ishihama A. Severinov K. Gourse R.L. Science. 1993; 262: 1407-1413Crossref PubMed Scopus (622) Google Scholar, 9.Igarashi K. Ishihama A. Cell. 1991; 65: 1015-1022Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (268) Google Scholar). The T7D-dependent transcription by the α235 mutant RNA polymerase also decreased to ∼50% of the level of the wild-type enzyme (Fig. 1 C, bar 3), implying that the T7D promoter may have a weak UP element that is recognized by α-CTD (see below). All the single Cys mutant RNA polymerases, except for the enzyme containing a single Cys α-subunit at residue 269, retained therrnBP1 transcription activity at ∼40–60% (Fig.1 B, bars 2, 4, and 6–11) and the CRP-dependent uxuAB transcription activity at ∼50–70% (Fig. 1 D, bars 2,4, and 6–11) of the level of the wild-type enzyme. The enzyme with a single Cys mutant α-subunit at position 269 (note that Cys is the original amino acid residue in the wild-type α-subunit, but this enzyme was reconstituted in parallel with other mutant enzymes) retained, as expected, almost the full activities of UP element-dependent rrnBP1 transcription (Fig.1 B, bar 5) and CRP-dependent uxuAB transcription (Fig.1 D, bar 5). After replacement of Cys-269 by Ala, however, the UP element- and CRP-dependent transcription activities were markedly reduced because Cys-269 is located on helix I, which is critical for transcription activation (15.Murakami K. Fujita N. Ishihama A. EMBO J. 1995; 15: 4358-4367Crossref Scopus (105) Google Scholar). All the mutant enzymes containing single Cys α-subunits, including the Cys-269 mutant α-subunit enzyme, showed T7D transcription activities as high as the wild-type enzyme ("

The purified enzyme, which is free of nucleic acid, is an α2-dimer with a molecular mass of ∼65 kDa. RNase BN displays a number of unusual catalytic properties compared with the other exoribonucleases of E. coli. The enzyme is most active at pH 6.5 in the presence of Co2+ and high concentrations of monovalent salts. It is highly specific for tRNA substrates containing an incorrect residue within the universal 3′-CCA sequence. Thus, tRNA-CU and tRNA-CA are effective substrates, whereas intact tRNA-CCA, elongated tRNA-CCA-Cn, phosphodiesterase-treated tRNA, and the closely related tRNA-CC are essentially inactive as substrates. RNA or DNA oligonucleotides also are not substrates. These data indicate that RNase BN has an extremely narrow substrate specificity. However, since tRNA molecules with incorrect residues within the -CCA sequence are not normally produced in E. coli, the role of RNase BN in uninfected cells remains to be determined.

However, since tRNA molecules with incorrect residues within the -CCA sequence are not normally produced in E. coli, the role of RNase BN in uninfected cells remains to be determined. 4-morpholineethanesulfonic acid tRNA genes in Escherichia coli are normally transcribed as precursor molecules that require processing at both their 5′- and 3′-ends to generate the mature functional forms (1.Deutscher M.P. Soll D. Rajbhandary U.L. tRNA: Structure, Biosynthesis, and Function. American Society for Microbiology, Washington, D. C.1995: 51-65Google Scholar). Maturation of the 5′-end of tRNA precursors is carried out by a single endoribonuclease, RNase P, whereas 3′-processing generally is a multistep process requiring the action of both endo- and exoribonucleases to remove the extra nucleotides following the encoded 3′-terminal -CCA sequence (1.Deutscher M.P. Soll D. Rajbhandary U.L. tRNA: Structure, Biosynthesis, and Function. American Society for Microbiology, Washington, D. C.1995: 51-65Google Scholar, 2.Li Z. Deutscher M.P. J. Biol.

A single pathway for 3′-maturation does not exist. Rather, it appears to proceed in a stochastic manner such that any one of five exoribonucleases (RNase II, D, BN, T, or PH) may act to complete the 3′-maturation process (2.Li Z. Deutscher M.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 6064-6071Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 3.Li Z. Deutscher M.P.

The process is more complicated in bacteriophage T4-infectedEscherichia coli. In this situation, eight new tRNAs encoded by the T4 genome are synthesized (6.Deutscher M.P. Foulds J. McClain W.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1974; 249: 6696-6699Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Four of these tRNA precursors lack the usually encoded -CCA sequence, and during their 3′-maturation, the incorrect residues must be removed and be replaced by the -CCA sequence through the action of tRNA nucleotidyltransferase (5.McClain W.H.

In certain mutant E. coli strains, BN and CAN, this process does not occur (7.Maisurian A.N. Buyanovskaya E.A. Mol. Gen. Genet. 1973; 120: 227-229Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar, 8.Maisurian A.N. Buyanovskaya E.A. Genetika. 1975; XI: 114-118Google Scholar). Thus, these strains do not support the growth of a mutant T4 phage (BU33) because a phage-encoded suppressor tRNASer, required for the translation of an amber mutation in a BU33 head protein, cannot be processed to its mature form due to a defect in 3′-maturation (9.Seidman J.G. Schmidt F.J. Foss K. McClain W.H. Cell. 1975; 5: 389-400Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). The molecular basis for this phenotype in strains BN and CAN is the deficiency of the exoribonuclease RNase BN (10.Asha P.K. Blouin R.T. Zaniewski R. Deutscher M.P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1983; 80: 3301-3304Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar, 11.Asha P.K. Deutscher M.P. J. Bacteriol. 1983; 156: 419-420Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Thus, in contrast to uninfected cells, in which at least five exoribonucleases can remove the extra residues following the -CCA sequence during 3′-maturation of tRNA precursors, only RNase BN appears able to remove incorrect residues within the -CCA sequence during phage T4 tRNA maturation. To learn more about the structure, function, and specificity of RNase BN, we first identified and cloned the rbn gene encoding the enzyme (12.Callahan C. Deutscher M.P. J. Bacteriol. 1996; 178: 7329-7332Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). We discovered that rbn is nonessential inE. coli and that it encodes a polypeptide of 32.8 kDa (12.Callahan C. Deutscher M.P. J. Bacteriol. 1996; 178: 7329-7332Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In this paper, we describe the overexpression, purification, and characterization of RNase BN. Plasmid pBS(+) (Stratagene) is an inducible multicopy vector. Plasmid pBSrbn + (12.Callahan C. Deutscher M.P. J. Bacteriol. 1996; 178: 7329-7332Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) was used to overexpress RNase BN. E. coli strain BL21(DE3) pLys (13.Studier W.F. Moffatt B.A. J. Mol. Biol. 1986; 189: 113-130Crossref PubMed Scopus (4842) Google Scholar) was used as the host for the aforementioned plasmid. Cells were routinely grown at 37 °C in YT medium or on YT plates (14.Miller J.H. Experiments in Molecular Genetics. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1972: 431-435Google Scholar). Ampicillin, when added, was present at a concentration of 200 or 300 μg/ml. Growth in liquid medium was followed by absorbance measurements at 600 nm. [3H]Poly(A), blue dextran 2000, Ultrogel-AcA44, and DEAE-Sephadex A-50 were obtained from Amersham Pharmacia Biotech. [14C]ATP and [γ-32P]ATP were obtained from NEN Life Science Products. Unlabeled poly(A) used to dilute the radioactive material was obtained from Sigma. Bacterial alkaline phosphatase was purchased from Worthington. N-Ethylmaleimide, 5,5′-dithiobis(2-nitrobenzoic acid), p-hydroxymercuribenzoate, and protein size markers were obtained from Sigma. Mercuric chloride was obtained from J. T. Baker Inc. Hydroxylapatite HT, Affi-Gel blue, and cellulose were purchased from Bio-Rad. All other chemicals were reagent-grade. RNase BN removes the 3′-terminal mononucleotide AMP from the phage tRNA precursor analogue tRNA-C[14C]A. This substrate was prepared as described previously (15.Deutscher M.P. Ghosh R.K. Nucleic Acids Res. 1978; 5: 3821-3829Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). Reaction mixtures of 100 μl contained 20 mm Hepes, pH 6.5, 0.2 mm CoCl2, 200 mm KCl, 8 or 16 μg of tRNA-C[14C]A (104 cpm/nmol), and cell extract or purified enzyme. Samples were incubated for 30 min at 37 °C, and acid-soluble radioactivity was determined. One unit of RNase BN is the amount of enzyme that releases 1 nmol of AMP in 1 h. Plasmid pBSrbn + carrying the rbn gene cloned under control of a T7 promoter was transformed into strain BL21(DE3) pLys. Bacteriophage DE3 contains the gene for T7RNA polymerase controlled by the lacUV5 promoter, which is inducible by isopropyl-β-d-thiogalactopyranoside. The pLys plasmid carries the gene for T7 lysozyme, which inhibits basal levels of T7 transcription in the uninduced cell. Cells were grown to an absorbance of 0.5 at 600 nm in YT medium containing 200 μg/ml ampicillin. To maintain therbn + plasmid, cells were then harvested by centrifugation at 5000 rpm for 5 min, washed with YT medium to remove β-lactamase, and then resuspended in fresh YT medium containing 300 μg/ml ampicillin. The culture was grown to an absorbance of just under 1 at 600 nm. The cells were spun down, washed with YT medium, and resuspended in YT medium containing 300 μg/ml ampicillin and 0.4 mm isopropyl-β-d-thiogalactopyranoside to induce T7 RNA polymerase. Cells were then grown for an additional 4 h before harvesting. All steps of the purification procedure were carried out at 4 °C in the cold room. Ten grams of induced cells (wet weight) were suspended in 2.5 volumes of Buffer A (10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 0.1 mm EDTA, and 0.1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride) and passed twice through an Amicon French press at 10,000 p.s.i. DNase I was added to the resulting extract at a concentration of 10 μg/ml, and the sample was incubated at 0 °C for 45 min. The extract was then centrifuged at 20,000 rpm for 40 min, and the soluble fraction obtained was centrifuged at 45,000 rpm for an additional 120 min in a Ti-70.1 rotor in a Beckman L8–70M ultracentrifuge. The supernatant fraction was diluted 2-fold with Buffer A containing 10% glycerol to lower the ionic strength and passed through a 0.22-μ syringe filter. The resulting 12-ml sample was applied to a DEAE-Sephadex A-50 column (2.8 × 13 cm) and washed with Buffer A containing 50 mm KCl until the A 280 was <1. The column was eluted using a linear gradient of 50–700 mm KCl in Buffer A. Eighty 1-ml fractions were collected. Fractions 51–73, with the highest RNase BN activity, were combined. This material was concentrated 5-fold with an Amicon Diaflo YM-10 membrane and dialyzed against 2 liters of Buffer B (5 mm potassium phosphate, pH 7.5, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 0.1 mm EDTA, and 0.1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride). The dialyzed 6.7-ml sample was applied to a hydroxylapatite column (2.8 × 13 cm) that contained 10% cellulose to improve flow rates and that had been equilibrated with Buffer B. The column was eluted with a linear gradient of 5–50 mm phosphate in Buffer B. Eighty 1-ml fractions were collected. Fractions 35–55, with the highest activity, were combined and concentrated ∼10-fold to a final volume of 2 ml by ultrafiltration as described above. The concentrated sample was applied to an Ultrogel-AcA44 column (1.8 × 78 cm) equilibrated with Buffer A containing 1 m KCl. The column was eluted with the same buffer. Eighty 2-ml fractions were collected. Fractions 42–74, containing RNase BN activity, were combined, dialyzed against 2 liters of Buffer A, and concentrated ∼30-fold by ultrafiltration to a final volume of 2 ml. The sample was applied to an Affi-Gel blue column (0.8 × 10 cm) and washed with Buffer A containing 50 mm KCl until the A 280was <1. The column was eluted with a linear gradient of 0–1m KCl in Buffer A. Fifty 75-μl fractions were collected, and the active fractions, in tubes 25–27 (see Fig. 1), were combined and frozen at −80 °C. Side fractions, 19–24 and 28–33, were also combined and concentrated 2-fold by ultrafiltration. This latter sample was split into three portions and stored at −80, −20, and −20 °C with 50% glycerol to ascertain the best storage conditions. Protein was determined by the method of Bradford (16.Bradford M.M. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 72: 248-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (217544) Google Scholar) with bovine serum albumin as a standard or by absorbance at 280 nm. Overexpression of RNase BN is deleterious to cell growth and generally leads to loss of the expression plasmid. 1C. Callahan and M. P. Deutscher, unpublished observation.However, use of the inducible T7 expression system (with changing of the medium to remove β-lactamase and to restore ampicillin levels) resulted in a 25-fold overproduction of RNase BN during the 4-h induction period. In several experiments, it was found that this amount of time gave maximum expression of RNase BN. As shown in Table I, RNase BN was purified from a high-speed supernatant fraction using a series of four chromatographic steps. The overall purification from the overexpressed extract was 46-fold, equivalent to ∼1000-fold from a normal extract. The apparent recovery was 50%; however, as is clear from the increased activity in steps 2 and 3, RNase BN activity in the supernatant fraction actually is inhibited 2–3-fold, presumably by the large amount of nucleic acid present. This inhibition was verified directly by mixing of purified RNase BN with the initial supernatant fraction (data not shown).Table ISummary of purification of RNase BNStepTotal ProteinTotal activitySpecific activityRelative purificationRecoverymgunitsunits/mg-fold%1.

Open table in a new tab Purified RNase BN was stored for 1 month under a variety of conditions and then re-assayed to determine optimal conditions for storage. Although the enzyme was relatively stable under all the conditions tested, it was most stable at −20 °C in the presence of 50% glycerol or at −80 °C after rapid freezing in a dry ice/ethanol bath. Under these conditions essentially no RNase BN activity was lost during the period of storage. Based on the close correspondence between RNase BN activity and absorbance at 280 nm upon elution from Affi-Gel blue (Fig. 1), it was apparent that RNase BN was quite pure. This was confirmed by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (Fig. 2). Overexpression of RNase BN is evident by comparison of lanes 6 and7. The progressive purification of RNase BN can be seen inlanes 6 to 2. We estimate that the most purified material (lane 2) was at least 95% pure. Spectral analysis of RNase BN, carried out in the range of 200–350 nm, revealed no unusual peaks (data not shown). TheA 280/A 260 ratio was 1.89, indicating that purified RNase BN is free of nucleic acid. Thus, RNase BN does not require nucleic acid for activity. SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (Fig. 2) indicated that purified RNase BN contains only a single species of polypeptide chain with a molecular mass of ∼37 kDa. This is in good agreement with the predicted size of RNase BN of 32.8 kDa based on the sequence of the rbn gene (12.Callahan C. Deutscher M.P. J. Bacteriol. 1996; 178: 7329-7332Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Based on gel filtration on Ultrogel-AcA44 (step 4 of the purification procedure) and assuming that it is a globular protein, the native molecular mass of RNase BN is ∼65 kDa. These data strongly support the conclusion that RNase BN functions as an α2-dimer, as previously suggested from earlier genetic studies in which an interruption-deletion mutant of RNase BN displayed a strong dominant-negative effect (12.Callahan C. Deutscher M.P. J. Bacteriol. 1996; 178: 7329-7332Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Based on the nucleotide sequence of the rbn gene, RNase BN contains 2 cysteine residues/polypeptide chain (12.Callahan C. Deutscher M.P. J. Bacteriol. 1996; 178: 7329-7332Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). To ascertain whether these residues are present in their reduced form and whether they might play a role in enzyme activity, purified RNase BN was incubated with the sulfhydryl reagents N-ethylmaleimide, 5,5′-dithiobis(2-nitrobenzoic acid), p-hydroxymercuribenzoate, and mercuric chloride. As presented in Table II, each of these reagents was found to be a potent inhibitor of RNase BN, decreasing RNase BN activity ∼90% upon preincubation for 30 min at 37 °C. These data show that at least 2 of the cysteine residues in native RNase BN are in the reduced form and that cysteine residues are required for enzyme activity. Whether these residues are directly required for catalysis or indirectly by maintaining structure, such as the dimeric form, remains to be determined.Table IIEffect of sulfhydryl reagents on RNase BN activitySulfhydryl reagentRNase BN activityActivity remainingpmol/h%None72100NEMaNEM, N-ethylmaleimide; DTNB, 5,5′-dithiobis(2-nitrobenzoic acid); PMB,p-hydroxymercuribenzoate.10.815DTNB2.23PMB6.59Mercuric chloride6.59Purified enzyme from the Affi-Gel blue combined fractions was used.

The enzyme was incubated at 37 °C with a 0.2 mmconcentration of the indicated sulfhydryl reagent for 30 min prior to assay. Data shown are the averages of two experiments. Samples of RNase BN were incubated at various temperatures for 10 min prior to determining the amount of activity remaining. The data in Fig.3 show that RNase BN remained stable for 10 min at temperatures up to 45 °C, and at 50 °C, still retained 66% of its activity. However, at 60 °C, 90% of the activity was lost in 10 min. Additional experiments revealed that RNase BN retained ∼25% of its activity upon incubation for 40 min at 50 °C (data not shown). These data indicate that RNase BN is moderately stable at elevated temperatures. RNase BN was assayed under a variety of conditions to assess the requirements for optimal activity. Assay at pH values between 6.0 and 8.0 in Mes2 and Hepes buffers indicated that RNase BN is most active at pH 6.5. Activity at pH 8.0 was 70% of that at pH 6.5, whereas that at pH 6.0 was 95% of that at pH 6.5. The relatively low pH optimum for RNase BN is unusual among the exoribonucleases of E. coli, which generally function optimally at more alkaline pH values. Among the divalent cations tested, significant activity was observed only with Co2+ and Mg2+, with Co2+being considerably more effective at 0.2 mm (TableIII). A more detailed examination of these two cations (Fig. 4) revealed that at its optimum (0.2 mm), Co2+ was approximately twice as effective as Mg2+ at its optimum (1 mm). Both cations displayed quite sharp optima. These findings are quite unusual as Co2+ has not been observed previously to function as such an effective cofactor for RNases.Table IIIDivalent cation requirement for RNase BN activityDivalent cationRNase BN activitypmol/hNone4Co2+29Mg2+12Mn2+6Cd2+6Ca2+1EDTA3Purified RNase BN (0.025 μg) was assayed as described under “Experimental Procedures” using 8 μg of substrate. The indicated divalent cation as the chloride salt was present at 0.2 mm. EDTA was added at 4 mm. Open table in a new tab Purified RNase BN (0.025 μg) was assayed as described under “Experimental Procedures” using 8 μg of substrate. The indicated divalent cation as the chloride salt was present at 0.2 mm. EDTA was added at 4 mm. RNase BN also requires a monovalent cation for activity. With K+ as the cation, the optimal concentration was 200–400 mm (Fig. 5). At 200 mm, the monovalent cation requirement could be satisfied by Li+, which was as effective as K+; Na+ and Rb+ were ∼70% as effective, and Cs+ was ∼30% as effective. A monovalent cation is also required when Mg2+ is the divalent cation. Although a number of other E. coli exoribonucleases are stimulated by monovalent cations, the absolute requirement of RNase BN for a monovalent cation is unusual. RNase BN is highly specific in its mode of action (Table IV). tRNA molecules in which a nucleotide residue within the normal 3′-terminal -CCA sequence has been replaced such as tRNA-CA and tRNA-CU were highly active as substrates, whereas all the other RNA molecules tested, even those with very similar structures, were essentially inactive. Thus, intact tRNA-CCA, diesterase-treated tRNA (which lacks 3′-terminal residues), and tRNA-CCA-Cn (which contains residues following the normal 3′ terminus) were all extremely poor substrates. Even the closely related tRNA-CC, which differs from the active substrates by a single terminal residue, was almost inactive. Given this high degree of specificity against such similar molecules, it is not surprising that rRNA and poly(A) also were poor substrates (Table IV).Table IVSubstrate specificity of RNase BNSubstrateRNase BN activitypmol/h[32P]tRNA<5[32P]Diesterase-treated tRNA<5[32P]rRNA<5tRNA-CC[14C]A<5tRNA-C[14C]C5tRNA-C[14C]A68tRNA-C[14C]U133tRNA-CCA-[14C]Cn<5[3H]Poly(A)5Purified RNase BN (0.05 μg) was assayed as described under “Experimental Procedures” using 800 pmol of each RNA substrate. Open table in a new tab Purified RNase BN (0.05 μg) was assayed as described under “Experimental Procedures” using 800 pmol of each RNA substrate. A second group of substrates consisting of RNA and DNA oligonucleotides 11–17 residues in length were also tested as substrates (TableV). The sequences of the RNA oligonucleotides are those of the 3′ terminus of E. colitRNA1Tyr and its precursor molecules with 3 or 6 extra 3′-residues. These molecules were labeled at their 5′ termini with 32P, and RNase BN action was assessed on a 20% acrylamide gel, which can detect shortening by even a single nucleotide residue. Based on this analysis, none of these molecules were substrates for RNase BN under standard assay conditions.Table VAction of RNase BN on oligonucleotidesSubstrateActivityRibo-5′-32P-CCCCACCACCA-3′No shorteningRibo-5′-32P-CCCCACCACCAUCA-3′No shorteningRibo-5′-32P-CCCCACCACCAUCACUU-3′No shorteningDeoxy-5′-32P-CCCCACCACCATCACTT-3′No shortening5′-32P-dA17No shortening5′-32P-dC17No shortening5′-32P-dT17No shorteningPurified RNase BN (0.025 μg) was assayed as described under “Experimental Procedures” using 3 pmol of each substrate. Open table in a new tab Purified RNase BN (0.025 μg) was assayed as described under “Experimental Procedures” using 3 pmol of each substrate. Based on earlier work in which relatively crude preparations of RNase BN were found to release UMP from tRNA-CU, it was suggested that this enzyme is an exoribonuclease (10.Asha P.K. Blouin R.T. Zaniewski R. Deutscher M.P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1983; 80: 3301-3304Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). To confirm this conclusion and to ensure that the release of mononucleotide was not due to a secondary reaction resulting from the presence of a contaminating activity, the products of the reaction catalyzed by highly purified RNase BN were examined. Thus, using tRNA-C[14C]A as a substrate, both the acid-soluble and tRNA products were determined (TableVI).Table VIProducts of RNase BN treatment of tRNA-C[ 14 C]AAmount of productProduct due to RNase BNAfter treatment with phosphataseNucleosideNucleotideaThe nucleotide fraction would contain any acid-soluble species that remains charged after phosphatase treatment.pmolpmol%Acid-soluble1414937[3H]CTP into tRNA (+RNase BN)3213[3H]CTP into tRNA (−RNase BN)19tRNA-C[14C]A was treated with RNase BN (0.05 μg) for 30 min as described under “Experimental Procedures.” Half of each reaction mixture was used to determine acid-soluble radioactivity, as usual.

The pH of the sample was adjusted to 7, and the sample was added to a 1-ml column of Dowex AG 1-X2.

Nucleosides were eluted with seven 1-ml portions of H2O, and nucleotide material was eluted with five 1-ml portions of 0.1 n HCl. Data shown are the averages of two experiments. If RNase BN were an exoribonuclease, the 14C-labeled acid-soluble product would be expected to be AMP, which, upon treatment with alkaline phosphatase, would be converted to the uncharged molecule [14C]adenosine. If, on the other hand, RNase BN were an endoribonuclease, any acid-soluble oligonucleotides produced would remain charged after treatment with the phosphatase and would elute with the “nucleotide” fraction. Columns of the anion exchanger Dowex AG 1-X2 were used to separate radioactive nucleoside from nucleotide species. As shown in Table VI, after phosphatase treatment, 93% of the acid-soluble radioactivity was eluted from the ion-exchange column with water, consistent with its being the nucleoside adenosine. To further verify the exoribonucleolytic action of RNase BN, the tRNA product was treated with tRNA nucleotidyltransferase in the presence of [3H]CTP. Removal of AMP from tRNA-CA would generate tRNA-C, a substrate for the incorporation of CMP by tRNA nucleotidyltransferase. As also shown in Table VI, release of 14 pmol of acid-soluble radioactivity from tRNA-C[14C]A by RNase BN resulted in the incorporation of 13 pmol of [3H]CTP over and above that incorporated in the absence of RNase BN action. The incorporation of [3H]CTP in the absence of RNase BN treatment is due to the fact that the preparation of the tRNA-C[14C]A substrate from tRNA-C is not quantitative, and some residual tRNA-C remains. Nevertheless, these data support the conclusion that RNase BN removed a single nucleotide residue from tRNA-C[14C]A to generate [14C]AMP and tRNA-C, as expected if it were an exoribonuclease. In this paper, the purification of RNase BN in its native untagged form has been described. RNase BN is now the seventh of the eight knownE. coli exoribonucleases (all except RNase R) to have been purified to near homogeneity. Interestingly, RNase BN is the sixth of the eight enzymes to exist as a multimer and the fifth to be an α2-dimer (polynucleotide phosphorylase is a trimer). Inasmuch as there is relatively little overall sequence similarity or similarity in size among the exoribonucleases as a group, it is intriguing that there is commonality in their quaternary structure. Perhaps, this represents some consistency among these enzymes in their interactions with substrate. As yet, there is very little detailed structural information about this class of enzymes, so the significance of their multimeric forms will have to await further work. In contrast to its shared structural similarity, RNase BN is unique among the E. coli exoribonucleases in a number of its catalytic properties. These include a low pH optimum of 6.5, a strong preference for Co2+ as the required divalent cation, and a requirement for a high concentration of monovalent ions or for elevated ionic strength. In addition, RNase BN displays a highly unusual and strict substrate specificity. Of the molecules tested, only those containing alterations within the 3′-terminal -CCA sequence serve as effective substrates, resulting in removal of the incorrect nucleotide. Other closely related molecules, even tRNA-CC, are inactive or very poorly active as substrates. This unusual substrate specificity makes RNase BN ideally suited for its, so far, only known biological role: the maturation of a subset of bacteriophage T4 tRNA precursors that lack the -CCA sequence (5.McClain W.H. Acc. Chem. Res. 1977; 10: 418-428Crossref Scopus (33) Google Scholar). RNase BN is essential for the 3′-processing of at least some of this group of tRNAs (6.Deutscher M.P. Foulds J. McClain W.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1974; 249: 6696-6699Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 9.Seidman J.G. Schmidt F.J. Foss K. McClain W.H. Cell. 1975; 5: 389-400Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). This, of course, raises the interesting question of what the role of RNase BN is in the uninfected E. coli cell. Clearly, this enzyme has not been maintained solely for its role during phage infection. It is known that RNase BN can contribute to the maturation of cellular tRNAs when other processing exoribonucleases are absent (3.Li Z. Deutscher M.P. Cell. 1996; 86: 503-512Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar,4.Kelly K.O. Deutscher M.P. J. Bacteriol. 1992; 174: 6682-6684Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). However, it is the poorest of all the exoribonucleases in this regard. RNase BN is not an essential enzyme in E. coli, and its absence has no effect on cell growth under usual laboratory conditions (12.Callahan C. Deutscher M.P. J. Bacteriol. 1996; 178: 7329-7332Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). It is possible that RNase BN is important during a stress response. In fact, RNase BN expression is affected by manipulation of certain proteins altered during heat shock,1 but further work is necessary to clarify this effect. One might expect that the unusual substrate specificity of RNase BN would be a clue to its cellular function. Yet in E. coli, in contrast to higher organisms, all tRNA genes encode the universal -CCA sequence (17.Deutscher M.P. Prog. Nucleic Acid Res. Mol. Biol. 1990; 39: 209-240Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar). Thus, there are no known conditions in which incorrect residues would be present in this sequence other than in the case of errors during transcription. From the foregoing discussion, it is evident that there is much remaining to be learned about the structure and function of RNase BN. Now, with the availability of purified protein and of mutant strains lacking RNase BN (12.Callahan C. Deutscher M.P. J. Bacteriol. 1996; 178: 7329-7332Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), continued progress can be expected in studies of this interesting enzyme."
https://openalex.org/W1968998179,"CpG islands are mostly unmethylated GC-, and CpG-rich chromosomal segments overlapping promoter sequences in all housekeeping and many tissue-specific genes in vertebrates. Typically, these islands show an open chromatin structure, low in histone H1 and rich in acetylated histones. We have previously found that the island-like CGCG-rich sites in human DNA are hypersensitive to DNase I upon cloning in Saccharomyces cerevisiae. Here we studied, with a higher resolution, the chromatin formed in yeast by one such site, the CpG island accompanying the human glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase gene. We have found two strong hypersensitive sites and several positioned nucleosomes flanking the island despite the absence in yeast of such chromatin fiber-shaping factors as histone H1, methyltransferase, and the tissue-specific transcription factors. This finding, together with similar observations from our laboratories and others supports the idea that variations in GC and/or CpG content substantially contribute to the DNA sequence features modulating the structure of the chromatin. The composition-dependent fluctuations in the accessibility of DNA in the chromatin may constitute an evolutionary advantage and may explain the surprising compositional selection that acts in both the coding and non-coding segments of some genes during mammalian evolution. CpG islands are mostly unmethylated GC-, and CpG-rich chromosomal segments overlapping promoter sequences in all housekeeping and many tissue-specific genes in vertebrates. Typically, these islands show an open chromatin structure, low in histone H1 and rich in acetylated histones.

They were identified in the chromosomes of vertebrates several years ago (1.Bird A. Taggard M. Frommer M. Miller O.J. Macleod D. Cell. 1985; 40: 91-99Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (473) Google Scholar), but their full functional and structural significance, as well as their evolutionary origin, remains elusive. The islands show variable length (ranging from a few hundred to a few thousand base pairs), variable content of short GC-rich sequence elements (such as the Sp1 transcription factor recognition site), variable position with respect to the start of transcription of neighbor genes, and so on. In addition, it seems that the chromosomal function of these islands varies (2.Delgado S. Gomez M. Bird A. Antequera F. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 2426-2435Crossref PubMed Scopus (196) Google Scholar). This variability has made it difficult to discern which features are important and which are secondary for the function of the islands. One of the most fundamental characteristics of any functionally important segment of DNA within the chromatin fiber is its accessibility to proteins. The simple but efficient test used for screening the chromosome for such sites consists of treatment of the chromatin with DNase I. The chromosomal sites most readily attacked by the enzyme, the hypersensitive sites (HS1), usually correspond to the sites of protein-DNA interactions (3.Gross D.S. Garrard W.T. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1988; 57: 159-197Crossref PubMed Scopus (953) Google Scholar). The CpG islands, as expected for functionally important genomic regions, form special, active, DNase I-hypersensitive chromatin. Histone H1 is present there in low amounts, histones H3 and H4 are acetylated, and nucleosome-free regions are present (4.Tazi J. Bird A. Cell. 1990; 60: 909-920Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (366) Google Scholar). Studies of the long-range distribution of hypersensitive sites in the mammalian chromosome showed that the strong HS are distributed with distances compatible with the size of the chromatin loops (5.Filipski J. Leblanc J. Youdale T. Sikorska M. Walker P.R. EMBO J. 1990; 9: 1319-1327Crossref PubMed Scopus (249) Google Scholar, 6.Gromova I.I. Nielsen O.F. Razin S.V. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 18685-18690Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). We have found a similar pattern of distribution of the HS in the chromatin of human DNA cloned in yeast artificial chromosomes (YAC) (7.Svetlova E. Avril-Fournout N. Ira G. Deschavanne P. Filipski J. Mol. Gen. Genet. 1998; 257: 292-298Crossref PubMed Scopus (6) Google Scholar). Interestingly enough, the same DNA segments were hypersensitive in both organisms. In particular, the locus control region of the β-globin gene cluster, which is nuclease-hypersensitive in human cells, remains hypersensitive upon cloning of the cluster as a YAC (7.Svetlova E. Avril-Fournout N. Ira G. Deschavanne P. Filipski J. Mol. Gen. Genet. 1998; 257: 292-298Crossref PubMed Scopus (6) Google Scholar). Some aspects of the higher order chromatin structure, both structural and functional, are apparently evolutionarily conserved between humans and yeast (7.Svetlova E. Avril-Fournout N. Ira G. Deschavanne P. Filipski J. Mol. Gen. Genet. 1998; 257: 292-298Crossref PubMed Scopus (6) Google Scholar, 8.Ira G. Svetlova E. Filipski J. Nucleic Acids Res. 1998; 26: 2415-2419Crossref PubMed Scopus (4) Google Scholar, 9.Klein S. Zenwirth D. Sherman A. Ried K. Rappold G. Simchen G. Nat. Genet. 1996; 13: 481-484Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). YACs appear to be a simplified but still informative model to study chromatin organization in the chromosome. Probably the most surprising finding was that several of the HS in YACs are co-localized with the strong, presumably multiple, CGCG tetranucleotide sites (7.Svetlova E. Avril-Fournout N. Ira G. Deschavanne P. Filipski J. Mol. Gen. Genet. 1998; 257: 292-298Crossref PubMed Scopus (6) Google Scholar). As this tetranucleotide is frequent inside and rare outside the CpG islands, our finding suggested that the CpG islands, which are hypersensitive in vertebrate cells, (4.Tazi J. Bird A. Cell. 1990; 60: 909-920Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (366) Google Scholar) remain hypersensitive upon cloning in yeast. There are no CpG islands in the yeast genome, and there is a priori no reason why these sites should be hypersensitive in yeast. The work presented here has been performed to have a closer look at the chromatin of a CpG island cloned in yeast. We have chosen the CpG island located at the 3′ end of the human gene encoding glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G6PD). We have found that the chromatin formed by this island is flanked by two strong hypersensitive sites and is associated with clusters of positioned nucleosomes. This finding confirms our earlier observation (7.Svetlova E. Avril-Fournout N. Ira G. Deschavanne P. Filipski J. Mol. Gen. Genet. 1998; 257: 292-298Crossref PubMed Scopus (6) Google Scholar) and suggests that the evolutionarily conserved GC richness observed in the regulatory regions of eukaryotic genomes (10.Shimizu T. Takahashi K. Tomita M. Gene. 1997; 205: 103-107Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar) might be caused by a selection based on an advantage associated with the DNA composition. A possibility should be taken into consideration that GC-rich, as opposed to AT-rich, DNA shows a propensity to form an open chromatin structure. YAC yWXD206 (alias XY206) cloned by Chen et al. (11.Chen E.Y. Zollo M. Mazzarella R. Ciccodicola A. Chen C.N. Zuo L. Heiner C. Burough F. Repetto M. Schlessinger D. D'Urso M. Hum. Mol. Genet. 1996; 5: 659-668Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar) in the AB1380 yeast strain was purchased from ATCC, Manassas, VA (see Fig. 1 A for a partial map). It carries the 3′ part of the gene coding for G6PD including the first two exons as well as the accompanying CpG island. A DNA segment extracted from the island (nucleotide 2528–2654 from the beginning of the insert) was capable of acting as a core promoter, assuring the regulation of expression of a reporter gene in mammalian but not in Drosophilacells (12.Franze A. Ferrante I.M. Fusco F. Santoro A. Sanzari E. Martini G. Ursini M.V. FEBS Lett. 1998; 437: 313-318Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). The full nucleotide genomic sequence of the region is available from GenBank™ (Locus HUMFLNG6PD). The integrity of the YAC was verified by mapping with MunI, XbaI,BssHII, and SfiI restriction enzymes. The hybridizations of the products of partial digestion of the YAC with these enzymes were performed using radioactive C and T probes. Probe T was a BamHI–PvuII fragment and probe C aPvuII--PstI fragment of pBR322 recognizing the YAC telomeres t and c (distal and proximal to the centromere, respectively). The YAC did not show any signs of major rearrangements. The probe G6PD7 used in the mapping of the positioned nucleosomes was prepared by a polymerase chain reaction using primers 5′-CACACACCCAGCTTCCTTCCTG and 5′-GCAAGAATCTTATCAGACCAATGGG. The micrococcal nuclease digestion was performed as described (13.Patel S.A. Graunke D.M. Pieper R.O. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 5813-5822Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar) using the nuclei isolated as described previously (7.Svetlova E. Avril-Fournout N. Ira G. Deschavanne P. Filipski J. Mol. Gen. Genet. 1998; 257: 292-298Crossref PubMed Scopus (6) Google Scholar) and suspended in MN buffer (10 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 60 mm KCl, 1 mm CaCl2, 15 mm NaCl). The DNA isolated from the reaction mixture was subsequently cut by theSfiI restriction enzyme and analyzed by electrophoresis in a 0.5% agarose gel and hybridization with the G6PD7 probe radioactively labeled as described before (7.Svetlova E. Avril-Fournout N. Ira G. Deschavanne P. Filipski J. Mol. Gen. Genet. 1998; 257: 292-298Crossref PubMed Scopus (6) Google Scholar). The DNase I digestion performed to localize the HS has been described before (7.Svetlova E. Avril-Fournout N. Ira G. Deschavanne P. Filipski J. Mol. Gen. Genet. 1998; 257: 292-298Crossref PubMed Scopus (6) Google Scholar). Among the chromosomal sites hypersensitive to DNase I in YACs carrying human DNA, some are particularly sensitive to the restriction enzyme that recognizes CGCG tetranucleotides (7.Svetlova E. Avril-Fournout N. Ira G. Deschavanne P. Filipski J. Mol. Gen. Genet. 1998; 257: 292-298Crossref PubMed Scopus (6) Google Scholar). This observation suggested that CpG islands, which are nuclease-hypersensitive in humans, remain hypersensitive upon cloning in yeast. To verify this hypothesis we have chosen the YAC carrying part of the gene coding for glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase, including its accompanying CpG island. Foremost, we wanted to ascertain that the DNA of the chosen YAC had not been rearranged. For that reason we mapped the MunI andXbaI (not shown) as well as BssHII andSfiI restriction sites (Fig.1 A) in the YAC. Their relative positions were concordant with those predicted on the basis of the nucleotide sequence extracted from GenBank™. In addition, the restriction map showed that the CpG island was located close to the telomere proximal to the centromere and that the YAC was somewhat shorter (31.7 kb) than reported in the literature (40 kb) (14.D'Urso M. Zucchi I. Ciccodicola A. Palmieri G. Abidi F.E. Schlessinger D. Genomics. 1990; 7: 531-534Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). The mapping of the site hypersensitive to DNase I in the YAC has been performed by treating the yeast chromatin with various concentrations of the enzyme. The resulting DNA products of partial digestion were size-fractionated by gel electrophoresis, transferred to a nylon membrane, and revealed by hybridization with the radioactively labeled telomeric probe C. Fig. 1 B (lanes 2–4) shows the result of hybridization of this DNA along with the hybridization of the product of partial digestion of the intact DNA with the restriction enzyme BssHII (lane 1). The latter enzyme recognizes the GCGCGC hexanucleotide, three copies of which (two of them overlapping) are clustered in the island, that generates a single band in the autoradiogram in the region of the island (Fig.1 B, lane 1). Comparison of the positions of the DNase I bands with that of the BssHII band reveals that two strong hypersensitive sites (Fig. 1 B) flank the CpG island in this YAC. The DNase I hypersensitivity depends on the chromatin structure, because the digestion of naked DNA with this enzyme did not produce any strong band on the autoradiogram in the corresponding position (not shown). The HS, including those formed by the CpG islands, are usually accompanied by positioned nucleosomes (4.Tazi J. Bird A. Cell. 1990; 60: 909-920Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (366) Google Scholar). This also appeared to be the case for the island studied here. The digestion of the YAC chromatin with micrococcal nuclease produces a ladder of bands compatible with the distances between positioned nucleosomes in the 6742-base pair-longSfiI segment containing the island (see Fig.2). The positioning extends into the transcriptional unit, about 1 kb beyond the limits of the CpG island. This may suggest that this region contributes to the chromatin organization of the G6PD gene in human cells and to the control of its expression (12.Franze A. Ferrante I.M. Fusco F. Santoro A. Sanzari E. Martini G. Ursini M.V. FEBS Lett. 1998; 437: 313-318Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). Several factors involved in the modulation of the accessibility of DNA along the chromatin fiber in higher eukaryotes are absent from yeast. First, the yeast lack CpG methylation activity. Second, yeast also lack the standard histone H1 (15.Patterton H.G. Landel C.C. Landsman D. Peterson C.L. Simpson R.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 7268-7276Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar). Finally, formation of hypersensitive sites and an active chromatin accompanied by nucleosome positioning and histone acetylation is believed to be associated with the formation of complexes between transcription factors and their respective recognition sites in the DNA. Some of the yeast transcription factors such as MIG1 or RAP1 apparently recognize the same consensus sequences as mammalian transcription factors (16.Lundin M. Nehlin J.O. Ronne H. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 1979-1985Crossref PubMed Scopus (198) Google Scholar, 17.Simon B. Tillotson L. Brand S.J. FEBS Lett. 1994; 351: 340-344Crossref PubMed Scopus (6) Google Scholar). The recognition sequence of MIG1 (GCGGGG) is even present in multiple copies in the CpG island studied. However, it has been shown that the presence of the consensus sequence alone is necessary but not sufficient for the DNA·MIG1 complex formation (16.Lundin M. Nehlin J.O. Ronne H. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 1979-1985Crossref PubMed Scopus (198) Google Scholar) and, more importantly, it has been demonstrated that there is a basic difference between the organization of yeast and mammalian promoters (18.Sauer F. Tijan R. Curr. Opin. Genet. Dev. 1997; 7: 176-181Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). Surprisingly, despite that difference, the yeast cell is able to organize the chromatin in the YAC in such a way that the open chromatin occupies its correct place in the region of CpG island (Fig. 1). This finding confirms and extends our previous results, showing co-localization of CGCG sites with the DNase I-hypersensitive sites in YACs (see Figs. 4 and 5 in Ref. 7.Svetlova E. Avril-Fournout N. Ira G. Deschavanne P. Filipski J. Mol. Gen. Genet. 1998; 257: 292-298Crossref PubMed Scopus (6) Google Scholar). Some earlier experiments from other laboratories (19.Wu T.-C. Lichten M. Genetics. 1995; 140: 55-66Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) showed that pairs of HS, accompanied by arrays of positioned nucleosomes, systematically appeared at the pBR322-yeast DNA junctions if the artificial constructs containing such junctions were inserted into the yeast natural chromosomes. Hypersensitive sites appear even at the boundaries between two segments of yeast DNA extracted from different parts of the yeast genome (20.Fan Q.Q. Petes T. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1966; 16: 2037-2043Crossref Scopus (71) Google Scholar, 21.Cao L. Alani E. Kleckner N. Cell. 1990; 61: 1089-1101Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (531) Google Scholar, 22.Ohta K. Wu T.-C. Lichten M. Shibata T. Nucleic Acids Res. 1999; 27: 2175-2180Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). The authors of these observations suggested that hypersensitivity arose either as a result of disruption of the arrangement of sequences that direct assembly of nucleosomes into regular arrays or by creating a collision between phased nucleosomes directed by different sequences (22.Ohta K. Wu T.-C. Lichten M. Shibata T. Nucleic Acids Res. 1999; 27: 2175-2180Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). Irrespective of whether these explanations are correct or not, in the case of the CpG island, the boundary, the nucleosome positioning, and the accompanying hypersensitivity do not result from artificial assembly of heterologous sequences but have evolved in their natural context of a human chromosome. We suggest that the appearance of these boundaries is related to the changes in the GC content and/or frequency of CpG dinucleotides. Such a change occurs at the extremities of a CpG island as well as at the borders of segments of the CpG-rich plasmid pBR322 embedded into yeast DNA. Probably, an unidentified factor(s) that is dependent on the local GC content and/or density of CpG dinucleotides in the DNA molecule influences the structure and/or the mobility of nucleosomes, and as a consequence, influences the structure of the chromatin fiber. Alternatively, the GC-rich DNA may have an intrinsic tendency to form a different kind of chromatin fiber than the AT-rich DNA. The border between the two types of fiber generates a structural discontinuity having the properties of a hypersensitive site. Three independent lines of evidence suggest that a GC and/or CpG frequency-related feature has an impact on the structure and function of the chromatin. First, there is the sensitivity of the chromatin formed in yeast by a heterologous CGCG-(7) and GC-rich (19.Wu T.-C. Lichten M. Genetics. 1995; 140: 55-66Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) DNA to DNase I. A second line of evidence comes from an analysis of CpG distribution in DNA. It appears (10.Shimizu T. Takahashi K. Tomita M. Gene. 1997; 205: 103-107Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar) that the observedversus expected density of CpG dinucleotides is elevated in a 1–2-kb-long segment overlapping the regulatory region of an average eukaryotic gene. This rule holds for all groups of eukaryotic organisms (as opposed to bacteria) irrespective of whether the organism methylates its CpG (like humans) or not (like yeast orDrosophila). We suppose that the high CpG content in these regions has evolved as the result of a requirement for nucleosomal positioning and for protein-accessible chromatin structure in these regions. The third piece of evidence has been obtained by population genetic tests. The analysis of the distribution of alleles of major histocompatibility complex genes in several mammalian species has demonstrated the existence of GC content-driven evolutionary selection in both coding and noncoding regions of these genes, including the CpG islands, introns, and silent positions in the coding regions (23.Eyre-Walker A. Genetics. 1999; 152: 675-683PubMed Google Scholar). In other words, the carriers of an allele of a major histocompatibility complex gene in which an AT base pair has been replaced by a GC base pair produce more abundant progeny than the carriers of the wild type allele, even if the mutation has not changed the protein coded by these genes. This result contributes to the old but still alive discussion (23.Eyre-Walker A. Genetics. 1999; 152: 675-683PubMed Google Scholar, 24.Pilar Francino M. Ochman H. Nature. 1999; 400: 30-31Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar) between neutralists and selectionists concerning the origin of the compositional compartments observed in some genomes. For example, in the human genome the housekeeping genes and their accompanying non-coding sequences are GC-rich (25.Holmquist G.P. Filipski J. Trends Ecol. Evol. 1994; 9: 65-69Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar), whereas the tissue-specific genes are either GC- or AT-rich. Neutralists suggested that GC-biased mutations occurring during DNA synthesis during replication (26.Wolfe K.H. Sharp P.M. Li W.-H. Nature. 1989; 337: 283-285Crossref PubMed Scopus (475) Google Scholar) or repair (27.Filipski J. FEBS Lett. 1987; 217: 184-186Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar) of the early replicating segments of the chromosomes might have filled these early replicating (26.Wolfe K.H. Sharp P.M. Li W.-H. Nature. 1989; 337: 283-285Crossref PubMed Scopus (475) Google Scholar), actively transcribed, and frequently recombining (28.Eyre-Walker A. Proc. R. Soc. Lond. B Biol. Sci. 1999; 252: 237-243Google Scholar) chromosomal segments with G and C. The late replicating regions might be under AT pressure like the genomes of some bacterial species (29.Deschavanne P. Filipski J. Nucleic Acids Res. 1995; 23: 1350-1353Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). The selectionists suggested that the process of evolutionary selection is involved in the regional enrichment of genomes in GC base pairs based on their higher thermal stability compared with AT base pairs (30.Bernardi G. Bernardi G. J. Mol. Evol. 1986; 24: 1-11Crossref PubMed Scopus (351) Google Scholar). As this explanation does not seem to be particularly convincing, the demonstration that composition-driven selection indeed takes place came as a surprise (23.Eyre-Walker A. Genetics. 1999; 152: 675-683PubMed Google Scholar). The results presented here, together with the results from other laboratories mentioned under “Results and Discussion” (10.Shimizu T. Takahashi K. Tomita M. Gene. 1997; 205: 103-107Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar, 19.Wu T.-C. Lichten M. Genetics. 1995; 140: 55-66Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 23.Eyre-Walker A. Genetics. 1999; 152: 675-683PubMed Google Scholar) allow us to suggest a new molecular base to explain the observed compositional selection in the crucial regions of the vertebrate chromosome. The DNA with high GC content and/or a high proportion of CpG dinucleotides (which is proportional to the square of the GC content) might have an intrinsic tendency to form an active chromatin structure. This may facilitate interaction with regulatory proteins in the region of promoters, simplifying the regulation of transcription. The easy formation of an active chromatin may also assure the smooth passage of the chromatin fiber carrying the transcription unit through the transcription factories (31.Cook P.R. Science. 1999; 284: 1790-1795Crossref PubMed Scopus (627) Google Scholar). This advantage might be high enough in the case of some important proteins to become a base for evolutionary selection of GC base pairs. It might also be the reason why some organisms have chosen, during evolution, GC-biased repair processes to repair their early replicating or frequently recombining genes in the germline. The combined effect of these processes may explain such a strange observation as the difference between functionally close but compositionally different α- and β-globin genes in humans (32.Bernardi G. Olofsson B. Filipski J. Zerial M. Salinas J. Cuny G. Meunier-Rotival M. Rodier F. Science. 1985; 228: 953-958Crossref PubMed Scopus (755) Google Scholar). This hypothesis is in agreement with the contemporary consensus opinion on the formation of chromatin structure. The current model states that methylation, tissue-specific transcription factor binding, acetylation, and histone H1 binding stabilize and provide fine tuning to the chromatin accessibility pattern. Contributing to that are other DNA features and trans-acting factors that also affect the chromatin (33.Wolffe A.P. Kurumizaka H. Prog. Nucleic Acid Res. Mol. Biol. 1998; 61: 379-422Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 34.Hendrich B. Bird A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 6538-6547Crossref PubMed Scopus (1049) Google Scholar, 35.Wolffe A.P. Hayes J.J. Nucleic Acids Res. 1999; 27: 711-720Crossref PubMed Scopus (431) Google Scholar). The evidence presented here suggests that one of these features could be the high GC content and/or concentration of CpG dinucleotides in the DNA sequence, which might contribute to the organization of the open chromatin structure near eukaryotic genes."
https://openalex.org/W2032685222,"The transcriptional repressor for rat vasoactive intestinal polypeptide receptor 1 (VIPR-RP) is a recently isolated transcription factor. In this study, we have characterized the functional domains of VIPR-RP and the importance of phosphorylation on VIPR-RP function. Using various regions of VIPR-RP in gel mobility shift assays, we show that the amino acid sequences between positions 367 and 475 play an essential role for VIPR-RP DNA binding. Transient transfection of fusion constructs containing GAL4 DNA binding domain and different parts of VIPR-RP indicated that there are two separate transcriptional repression domains in VIPR-RP, located between amino acids 50 and 101 and between 469 and 527. We demonstrated that VIPR-RP is phosphorylated in vitro by casein kinase II on Ser-69/71 and Thr-110, and by cAMP-dependent kinase on Ser-245/361. Furthermore, by site-directed mutagenesis, we show that phosphorylation of the casein kinase II sites potentiates VIPR-RP transcriptional repression activity by enhancing its nuclear translocation, and that phosphorylation by cAMP-dependent kinase inhibits VIPR- RP transcriptional repression function without affecting its subcellular localization. These observations suggest that phosphorylation plays an important role in regulating VIPR-RP function."
