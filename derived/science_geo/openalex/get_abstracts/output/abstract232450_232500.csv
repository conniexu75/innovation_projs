However, the results of transcriptional programming of an osteoclast-specific cathepsin K gene are inconclusive. Here we report the regulatory mechanisms of RANKL-induced cathepsin K gene expression during osteoclastogenesis in a p38 MAP kinase-dependent manner. The reporter gene analysis with sequential 5′-deletion constructs of the cathepsin K gene promoter indicates that limited sets of the transcription factors such as NFATc1, PU.1, and microphthalmia transcription factor indeed enhance synergistically the gene expression when overexpressed in RAW264 cells. In addition, the activation of p38 MAP kinase is required for the maximum enhancement of the gene expression. RANKL-induced NFATc1 forms a complex with PU.1 in nuclei of osteoclasts following the nuclear accumulation of NFATc1 phosphorylated by the activated p38 MAP kinase. These results suggest that the RANKL-induced cathepsin K gene expression is cooperatively regulated by the combination of the transcription factors and p38 MAP kinase in a gradual manner.

During osteoclastogenesis, stimulation of the RANK receptor triggers causal induction of osteoclast-specific marker genes defining the fate of the cell or its function. Among these genes, the expression of genes closely linked to bone resorption is specifically regulated by limited sets of transcriptional factors such as PU.1 (15Tondravi M.M. McKercher S.R.

The interaction of MITF with either PU.1 or PU.1-interacting protein allows efficient induction of an osteoclast-specific marker of the tartrate-resistant acid phosphatase (TRAP) gene in a synergistic manner (22So H.

In mutant mice models, these transcription factors are disrupted or mutated but are of prime importance in showing their essential roles for osteoclast differentiation or its function, and these mice exhibit osteopetrosis because of defects in multinucleated osteoclasts (17Wang Z.Q. Ovitt C. Grigoriadis A.E. Mohle-Steinlein U. Ruther U. Wagner E.F. Nature. 1992; 360: 741-745Crossref PubMed Scopus (810) Google Scholar). Recently, it has been revealed that the nuclear factor of activated T cells (NFAT) c1 transcription factor was induced by RANKL stimulation and then activated the TRAP gene promoter synergistically with c-Fos (24Ishida N. Hayashi K. Hoshijima M. Ogawa T. Koga S. Miyatake Y. Kumegawa M. Kimura T. Takeya T. J. Biol.

Thus, the inducibility of the osteoclast-specific genes is controlled by the combination of the RANKL-induced and noninducible transcription factors in a gradual manner. A cysteine protease of the osteoclast-specific marker cathepsin K, which is capable of hydrolyzing extracellular bone matrix proteins, is highly expressed in osteoclasts (26Saftig P. Hunziker E. Wehmeyer O. Jones S. Boyde A. Rommerskirch W. Moritz J.D. Schu P. von Figura K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 13453-13458Crossref PubMed Scopus (759) Google Scholar). Pycnodysostosis is a human disease caused by congenital cathepsin K deficiency and indicates a crucial role of cathepsin K in the functional maturation of osteoclasts (27Gelb B.D. Shi G.P. Chapman H.A. Desnick R.J. Science. 1996; 273: 1236-1238Crossref PubMed Scopus (859) Google Scholar). The expression of the cathepsin K gene is controlled physiologically in vivo and in vitro by MITF (28Motyckova G. Weilbaecher K.N. Horstmann M. Rieman D.J. Fisher D.Z. Fisher D.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 5798-5803Crossref PubMed Scopus (194) Google Scholar). The mutant mi/mi mice that express a dominant negative form of MITF have the following characteristics, unpigmented small eyes, several intrinsic defects in melanocytes, mast cells, and multinucleated osteoclasts leading to osteopetrosis (21Hodgkinson C.A.

Cell. 1993; 74: 395-404Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (950) Google Scholar), which indicate essential roles of MITF in development of several cell type lineages. Cathepsin K mRNA is still expressed in osteoclasts derived from the mutant mice (28Motyckova G. Weilbaecher K.N. Horstmann M. Rieman D.J. Fisher D.Z. Fisher D.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Res. 2000; 15: 451-460Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar), suggesting a possible involvement of at least another modulator(s) upon the gene expression. In osteoclast differentiation, the RANKL signaling is mainly mediated by recruiting adaptor molecules, TRAF proteins, that activate the mitogen-activated protein (MAP) kinase cascades (14Teitelbaum S.L. Science. 2000; 289: 1504-1508Crossref PubMed Scopus (3104) Google Scholar, 30Wong B.R. Josien R. Lee S.Y. Vologodskaia M. Steinman R.M. Choi Y. J. Biol.

Three distinct MAPs kinases, extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK), c-Jun N-terminal kinase, and p38 MAP kinase, identified in mammalian cells, are implicated as mediators to transmit nuclear signaling for cell growth and differentiation in response to stress and various cytokines (31Cobb M.H.

Cell Biol. 2000; 2: 110-116Crossref PubMed Scopus (691) Google Scholar). Each of the kinases can activate specific transcription factors through direct phosphorylation prior to efficient expression of target genes. The p38 MAP kinase family members, consisting of p38α, p38β (33Jiang Y. Chen C. Li Z. Guo W. Gegner J.A. Lin S. Han J. J. Biol.

In fact, we and others (23Matsumoto M. Sudo T. Saito T. Osada H. Tsujimoto M. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 31155-31161Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (475) Google Scholar, 36Li X. Udagawa N. Itoh K. Suda K. Murase Y. Nishihara T. Suda T. Takahashi N. Endocrinology. 2002; 143: 3105-3113Crossref PubMed Scopus (171) Google Scholar) have reported that p38α MAP kinase activated by MAP kinase kinase 3 (MKK3) or MKK6, downstream of the RANKL signaling pathway, is critical for the relatively early phase of osteoclast differentiation. Recently, Mansky et al. (37Mansky K.C. Sankar U. Han J. Ostrowski M.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 11077-11083Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (197) Google Scholar) have reported that p38α MAP kinase phosphorylates MITF, resulting in increasing a synergistic expression level of the TRAP gene. These findings suggest that the critical roles of p38 MAP kinase are to trigger and enhance the coordinated induction of the osteoclast-specific gene(s) through the modification of the limited sets of the transcription factor(s). However, the molecular mechanism of the cathepsin K gene expression remains to be fully defined in the context of RANKL-induced osteoclast differentiation mediated by the MAP kinase cascades. This study shows that treatment with SB203580, a specific inhibitor of the p38 MAP kinase, markedly suppresses not only RANKL-induced cathepsin K gene expression in osteoclasts but osteoclast differentiation. After the analyses of the inducible mechanism of the RANKL-induced cathepsin K gene, we found here for the first time that NFATc1 interacts directly with PU.1, and these factors activate the gene promoter in concert with MITF. p38 MAP kinase phosphorylates NFATc1 but not PU.1 and thereby invokes enhancement of nuclear accumulation of NFATc1 and of the transcriptional activation of the cathepsin K gene promoter. These findings suggest that the transcriptional program of the RANKL-induced osteoclast-specific genes is controlled by limited sets of transcription factors at distinct stages of osteoclast differentiation. These studies give more detailed molecular analyses of the cathepsin K gene transcription leading the cells to undergo terminal differentiation of osteoclasts.

Recombinant human macrophage colony-stimulating factor (M-CSF) was kindly provided by Morinaga Milk Industry Co., Ltd. (Tokyo, Japan). Polyclonal antibodies against p38 MAP kinase and phosphorylated p38 MAP kinase (Thr180/Tyr182) were purchased from Cell Signaling Technology, Inc. (Beverly, MA). Polyclonal antibody against PU.1 was purchased from Santa Cruz Biotechnology (Santa Cruz, CA). The anti-NFATc1 monoclonal antibody was purchased from BD Biosciences. Alexa Fluor 546 goat antimouse and 488 goat anti-rabbit IgG antibodies were purchased from Molecular Probes, Inc. (Eugene, OR). Reverse transcription-PCR kit was obtained from Invitrogen. SB203580 and PD98059 were purchased from Calbiochem. Cell Culture—Bone marrow cells were prepared by removing femurs and tibias from 6- to 8-week-old C5B/B6N mice and flashing the bone marrow cavity with α-modified minimum Eagle's medium (Sigma) containing 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS; Biological Industries, Israel) and 50 μg/ml penicillin/streptomycin (ICN Biomedical, Inc. OH). After lysing the erythrocytes in lysing buffer (17 mm Tris, pH 7.65, 0.75% NH4Cl), cells were seeded at 1.5 ×106 cells/well (0.5 ml) in 24-well plates in the presence of M-CSF. After a 3-day incubation, nonadherent cells were removed from the culture by pipetting and washed with phosphate-buffered saline (PBS). Adherent cells were further incubated in the presence of M-CSF and sRANKL for 5–6 days. The culture medium was replaced every 3 days with fresh complete medium. The cells were then washed and subjected to immunostaining, reverse transcription-PCR (RT-PCR), and immunoblot analysis. The murine RAW264 cells (RIKEN, RCB0535) were maintained in α-modified minimum essential medium supplemented with 10% FBS (JRH Biosciences, Lenexa, KS) and 50 μg/ml penicillin/streptomycin as described previously. The HEK293 cells were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (Invitrogen) supplemented with 10% FBS and 50 μg/ml penicillin/streptomycin. Peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) were prepared from human heparinized blood by the Ficoll-Paque gradient centrifugation method and were incubated with human M-CSF. After 7 days, adherent macrophages were cultured with sRANKL for 3–5 days, and human osteoclasts were subjected to chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) assay. Detection of Cathepsin K mRNA Expression by RT-PCR—Total RNA for cDNA synthesis was isolated from murine bone marrow cells and cultured cells as described previously (38Matsumoto M. Hisatake K. Nogi Y. Tsujimoto M. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 33086-33092Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). RNA was reverse-transcribed by using SuperscriptII reverse transcriptase, 1 mm dNTPs, 1 μg of oligo(dT) primers, and the supplied buffer (Invitrogen). RT-PCR assay was carried out using the following primer pairs: 5′-TGGATGAAATCTCTCGGCGT-3′ (sense) and 5′-TCATGTCTCCCAAGTGGTTC-3′ (antisense). PCR was carried out for 1 cycle at 95 °C for 5 min, followed by 25 cycles at 95 °C for 0.5 min, 57 °C for 0.5 min, and 72 °C for 0.5 min. The relative amounts of the cathepsin K mRNAs were normalized to that of the β-actin mRNA (39Matsumoto M. Sudo T. Maruyama M. Osada H. Tsujimoto M. FEBS Lett. 2000; 486: 23-28Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). Plasmid Construction—The pcDNA3NFATc1 plasmid was kindly provided by Dr. M. A. Brown (Emory University School of Medicine). The pcDNA3PU.1 plasmid was a kind gift of Dr. H. Sighn (Harvard Medical School). The MITF expression plasmid, pcDNAFLAG-MITF, was constructed as described previously (38Matsumoto M. Hisatake K. Nogi Y. Tsujimoto M. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 33086-33092Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). The expression plasmids for murine p38, pcDNA3p38, and the constitutive active form of MKK6 (MKK6CA), pSRαMKK6, were kindly provided by Dr. T. Sudo (RIKEN) and Dr. M. Karin (University of California, San Diego), respectively. The cathepsin K gene promoter plasmid, p-1108CathepsinLuc, was constructed by obtaining a human genomic clone encoding the 5′-flanking region of the cathepsin K gene by PCR. The fragments of the sequentially deleted sequence from –1108, –818, –516, or –222 to +1 of the cathepsin K gene promoter were amplified by PCR using specific primers as a template. These fragments were then subcloned into MluI/HindIII sites of pGL3 basic vector containing the luciferase reporter gene (Promega, Madison, WI). Transfection and Luciferase Assay—For transfection of the reporter plasmid, RAW264 cells were plated on 12-well plates at a density of 3 × 105 cells/well the day before transfection. A total of 2 μg of plasmid DNA was mixed with Superfect (Qiagen, Santa Clarita, CA) and transfected into the cells following the manufacturer's protocol. After 48 h of transfection, the cells were washed three times with PBS and then lysed in reporter lysis buffer (Promega; Madison, WI). Luciferase activity was then measured with a luciferase assay system (Promega) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Luciferase activity was measured in triplicate, averaged, and then normalized to β-galactosidase activity to correct for transfection efficiency. β-Galactosidase activity was measured by using an o-nitrophenyl-β-d-galactopyranoside as a substrate. Electrophoretic Mobility-shift Analysis (EMSA)—The full-length murine NFATc1 and PU.1 cDNAs were transcribed by using T7 RNA polymerase, and the RNAs were then subjected to in vitro translation with rabbit reticulocyte lysate (Promega) as described previously (40Matsumoto M. Tanaka N. Harada H. Kimura T. Yokochi T. Kitagawa M. Schindler C. Taniguchi T. Biol. Chem. Hoppe-Seyler. 1999; 380: 699-703Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). Oligonucleotide probes employed were labeled with [γ-32P]ATP using T4 polynucleotide kinase. DNA binding assays were performed by incubating 2 μl of reticulocyte lysates and 32P-labeled double-stranded oligonucleotides for 30 min at 30 °C. For competition assays, a 200-fold excess of unlabeled double-stranded oligonucleotides was added in the reaction mixture. The samples were then resolved on a 4% polyacrylamide gel run in TBE buffer. Western Blot Analysis—Immunoblot analyses and immunoprecipitations were performed as described. In brief, cells were lysed in lysis buffer (20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, 1 mm Na2EDTA, 1 mm EGTA, 1% Triton, 2.5 mm sodium pyrophosphate, 1 mm β-glycerophosphate, 1 mm Na3VO4, 1 μg/ml leupeptin, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride). Whole cell extracts (WCEs) were prepared by centrifugation at 10,000 × g for 15 min at 4 °C after sonication of cells four times for 5 s. WCEs (30 μg) were electrophoresed on a 12% SDS-polyacrylamide gel and blotted onto a polyvinylidene difluoride membrane. Immunoblot detection was performed with the corresponding antibodies using an ECL detection kit (Amersham Biosciences). Protein Kinase Assays—p38 MAP kinase activity was measured in an immune complex kinase assay. Phosphorylated p38 MAP kinase was immunoprecipitated by anti-phosphorylated p38 (pp38) polyclonal antibody immobilized on agarose beads (anti-pp38 Ab-agarose). After 3 h of incubation at 4 °C, the immunoprecipitates were collected and washed twice with WCEs lysis buffer and then twice with kinase buffer (25 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 5 mm β-glycerophosphate, 2 mm dithiothreitol, 0.1 mm Na3VO4, 10 mm MgCl2). Immunoprecipitates of anti-pp38 Ab-agarose were mixed with 2 μg of GST fused to the truncated form of NFATc1 (GST-NFATc1) protein as a substrate and 5 μCi of [γ-32P]ATP in 30 μl of kinase buffer. The reaction mixture was further incubated for 30 min at 30 °C. The kinase reaction was terminated in the appropriate volume of SDS sample buffer. The phosphorylated GST-NFATc1 was then detected by autoradiography. Immunofluorescence Staining—Authentic osteoclasts on coverslips were fixed in PBS containing 4% paraformaldehyde for 10 min at room temperature and then washed in PBS. The coverslips were permeabilized in 0.1% Triton X-100 for 5 min, immersed in 5% normal goat serum for 30 min, incubated in the appropriate primary antibodies for 1 h, washed in PBS, incubated for 1 h in the appropriate fluorescent-conjugated secondary antibodies, and washed. All coverslips were mounted in OCT compound. Cells were examined by using fluorescence microscopy (Axioplan2 Imaging MOT; Zeiss). Images were recorded, and composite images were compiled by using AxioVision 3.1. The image enhancement was performed by using Adobe Photoshop 6.0. ChIP Assay—The ChIP assay was carried out essentially as described (41Saccani S. Pantano S. Natoli G. J. Exp. Med. 2001; 193: 1351-1359Crossref PubMed Scopus (338) Google Scholar), with a minor modification. Briefly, human PBMC, macrophages, and osteoclasts were treated with 1% formaldehyde for 15 min. The cross-linked chromatin was prepared and sonicated prior to being immunoprecipitated with antibodies against PU.1 and NFATc1 and the acetylated Lys14 (K14) and phosphorylated Ser10 (S10) forms of histone H3 (Upstate Biotechnology Inc., Lake Placid, NY) or control rabbit or murine IgG antibody (Santa Cruz, CA) at 4 °C overnight. After reversal of cross-linking, genomic DNA associated with the immunoprecipitated chromatin was used as a template for amplification by PCR at 27 or 30 cycles by using various sets of primers as indicated below. The amplified PCR product was resolved by 1.5% agarose gel electrophoresis, subsequently transferred to nylon membrane, and subjected to Southern blot analysis with a 32P-labeled cathepsin K promoter-specific probe spanning each region. For PCR amplification of specific regions of the cathepsin K genomic locus, the following primer sets were used: a region containing the PU.1-binding P2 site, sense, 5′-GAGGGTTTATGCATGGAATCCAGC-3′, and antisense, 5′-TCTAGGACAAGTCACATGAGCTTC-3′; a region containing NFATc1-binding N2 site, 5′-CATCCCAGAGGTGAGAGTCAGAC-3′, and antisense, 5′-GGAGCTTACTTTCTCTTTTGGTGAG-3′; and a region of exon 7, sense, 5′-GTGTATTATGATGAAAGCTGCAATAGC-3′, and antisense, 5′-CTGTTTTTAATTATCCAGTGCTTGTTTCC-3′ as a negative control. p38 MAP Kinase Is Essential for the Induction of Cathepsin K Gene by RANKL—MAP kinases are important for transmitting various extracellular signals to the nucleus in diverse biological phenomena including cell differentiation (4Lee Z.H.

Chem. 2001; 276: 33086-33092Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar) that terminal osteoclast differentiation induced by RANKL is accompanied by the increased expression of cathepsin K mRNA. To determine whether the p38 MAP kinase signaling pathway is involved in the RANKL-induced cathepsin K gene expression, we analyzed cathepsin K mRNA by using semiquantitative RT-PCR in the presence or absence of specific kinase inhibitors. As shown in Fig. 1A, murine bone marrow macrophage (BMMϕ) cells were allowed to differentiate into mononuclear or multinucleated tartrate acid phosphatase (TRAP)-positive osteoclasts in the presence of RANKL and M-CSF for 3–5 days, and total RNAs were isolated for PCR analysis. Fig. 1B shows that RANKL treatment of BMMϕ cells increased the expression of cathepsin K mRNA by 19.8- and 28.9-fold at day 3 and 5, respectively, during osteoclast differentiation. When the cells were treated with RANKL in the presence of SB203580, a specific inhibitor of p38 MAP kinase (43Cuenda A. Rouse J. Doza Y.N. Meier R. Cohen P. Gallagher T.F. Young P.R. Lee J.C.

Adams J.L. Lee J.C. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1999; 263: 825-831Crossref PubMed Scopus (228) Google Scholar), a dramatic reduction in the expression of cathepsin K mRNA as well as inhibition of osteoclast differentiation was observed. By contrast, PD98059, a specific inhibitor of MAP kinase kinase for the MAPK/ERK pathway, had no effect on the RANKL-induced expression of cathepsin K mRNA. Similar results were obtained by using the murine monocyte/macrophage cell line, RAW264, which can differentiate into osteoclasts (data not shown). As control, the expression of β-actin mRNA was not affected by the treatment with RANKL in the presence or absence of the inhibitors. These results suggest that the induction of cathepsin K expression by RANKL is largely mediated by the p38 MAP kinase but not the MAPK/ERK signaling pathway. Identification of RANKL-responsive Elements for NFAT Family and PU.1 in Cathepsin K Gene Promoter—Previous analyses of human cathepsin K gene promoter revealed several potentially important regulatory cis-elements, including the PU.1 and E box sites (46Rood J.A.

Our goal in this study was to determine where this occurs in the context of histologically defined breast cancer progression. To this end, we assessed genome instability (using fluorescence in situ hybridization) and other features associated with telomere crisis in normal ductal epithelium, usual ductal hyperplasia, ductal carcinoma in situ and invasive cancer. We modeled this process in vitro by measuring these same features in human mammary epithelial cell cultures during ZNF217-mediated transition through telomere crisis and immortalization. Taken together, the data suggest that transition through telomere crisis and immortalization in breast cancer occurs during progression from usual ductal hyperplasia to ductal carcinoma in situ."

In contrast, their potential role(s) in anti-bacterial defense and neutrophil activation mechanisms is less well explored. By comparing gene expression patterns between immature and mature human neutrophils, we obtained evidence that intracellular proteases and other anti-bacterial proteins are produced at earlier stages of maturation, whereas the genes for receptors and signaling molecules required for the release of these effector molecules are preferentially induced during terminal differentiation. For instance, mature neutrophils strongly expressed genes that increase their responses to type I and type II IFNs. Interestingly, granulocyte/macrophage colony-stimulating factor was identified as a repressor of IFN signaling components and consequently of IFN-responsive genes. Both IFN-α and IFN-γ induced strong tyrosine phosphorylation of STAT1 in mature but not in immature neutrophils. Functional in vitro studies suggested that IFNs act as priming factors on mature neutrophils, allowing the formation of extracellular traps upon subsequent stimulation with complement factor 5a (C5a). In contrast, both IFN-α and IFN-γ had only little capacity to prime immature cells in this system. Moreover, both IFNs did not have significant anti-proliferative effects on immature neutrophils. These data contribute to our understanding regarding changes of gene expression during neutrophil differentiation and IFN-mediated anti-bacterial defense mechanisms.

Neutrophils are a critical component of the innate immune system with several effector and immunoregulatory functions (1Simon H.-U. Immunol. Rev. 2003; 193: 101-110Crossref PubMed Scopus (298) Google Scholar). They are generated in the bone marrow under the influence of cytokines, such as granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (G-CSF) 1The abbreviations used are: G-CSF, granulocyte colony-stimulating factor; GM-CSF, granulocyte/macrophage colony-stimulating factor; C5a, complement factor 5a; GAPDH, glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase; IFN, interferon; Jak, Janus kinase; MPO, myeloperoxidase; PBMC, peripheral blood mononuclear cells; STAT, signal transducer and activator of transcription; Ab, antibody; mAb, monoclonal Ab. and granulocyte/macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF), from hematopoietic stem cells. Interestingly, G-CSF is not expressed in normal bone marrow cells under physiologic conditions (2Cluitmans F.H.M. Besendam B.H.J. Landegent J.E. Willemze R. Falkenberg J.H.F. Blood. 1995; 85: 2038-2044Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), suggesting that it drives myeloid differentiation in a hormonal manner. Multiple cell types such as endothelial cells, epithelial cells, fibroblasts, and macrophages are able to produce G-CSF and GM-CSF (3Broudy V.C. Kaushansky K. Harlan J.M. Adamson J.W. J. Immunol. 1987; 139: 464-468PubMed Google Scholar, 4Dibbert B. Weber M. Nikolaizik W.H. Vogt P. Schöni M.H. Blaser K. Simon H.-U. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 13330-13335Crossref PubMed Scopus (264) Google Scholar). All these cells make early contact with invading microorganisms and/or their products, resulting in increased cytokine production after infection. For instance, blood G-CSF levels have been described to rise from 25 to up to 10,000 pg/ml under pathologic conditions (5Kawakami M. Tsutsumi H. Kumakawa T. Abe H. Hirai M. Kurosawa S. Mori M. Fukushima M. Blood. 1990; 76: 1962-1964Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Moreover, systemic injection of G-CSF (6Anderlini P. Przepiorka D. Champlin R. Korbling M. Blood. 1996; 88: 2819-2825Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) or GM-CSF (7Ganser A. Völkers B. Greher J. Ottmann O.G. Walther F. Becher R. Bergmann L. Schulz G. Hoelzer D. Blood. 1989; 73: 31-37Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) results in a dramatic increase of neutrophil production. Taken together, G-CSF and GM-CSF have been demonstrated to be major regulators of neutrophil production. Under conditions of stress, such as infections, neutrophil numbers in blood can increase as a consequence of cytokine-forced neutrophil differentiation. Although immature neutrophils can be classified by morphology as well as by the expression of more or less specific surface proteins (8Terstappen L.W.M.M. Safford M. Loken M.R. Leukemia (Baltimore). 1990; 4: 657-663PubMed Google Scholar), it is difficult to obtain pure cell populations characterized by a certain maturation stage. Therefore, most of the studies trying to understand neutrophil differentiation at the molecular level were performed by using cell lines derived from leukemias. Previously published work resulted in the identification of genes that may play critical roles in the differentiation of neutrophils (9Lian Z. Wang L. Yamaga S. Bonds W. Beazer-Barclay Y. Kluger Y. Gerstein M. Newburger P.E. Berliner N. Weissman S.M. Blood. 2001; 98: 513-524Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). Moreover, a gene expression profile of neutrophils has been established (10Itoh K. Okubo K. Utiyama H. Hirano T. Yoshii J. Matsubara K. Blood. 1998; 92: 1432-1441Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Despite these previous studies, the underlying molecular events of normal neutrophil differentiation are not well understood, and many of the genes that are expressed by mature neutrophils have not been related to function. The objective of this study was to compare the transcriptional repertoire of immature and mature human neutrophils by using oligonucleotide microarrays. In addition we investigated whether certain differences in gene expression are reversible by in vitro re-exposure of mature neutrophils with GM-CSF. Although multiple genes were more expressed in mature compared with immature cells, it was interesting to see that mature neutrophils also demonstrated higher expression of genes, which transduce signals of type I and type II interferons. Consequently, several known IFN-responsive genes had elevated expression levels in mature compared with immature cells. The subsequently obtained functional data demonstrate the importance of increased IFN sensitivity of mature neutrophils for the formation of extracellular traps, which consist of antimicrobial agents able to kill bacteria (11Brinkmann V. Reichard U. Goosmann C. Fauler B. Uhlemann Y. Weiss D.S. Weinrauch Y. Zychlinsky A. Science. 2004; 303: 1532-1535Crossref PubMed Scopus (6220) Google Scholar). Reagents—Human IFN-α was purchased from PBL Biomedical Laboratories (Alexis Corp., Lausen, Switzerland), and human IFN-γ was from R&D Systems (Abingdon, United Kingdom). Human GM-CSF was from Novartis Pharma GmbH (Nürnberg, Germany), and human GCSF was from Aventis Pharma AG (Zurich, Switzerland). Complement factor 5a (C5a) was from Calbiochem. Fluorescein-conjugated anti-CD14 and anti-CD15 and allophycocyanin-conjugated anti-CD34 and anti-CD11b as well as phycoerythrin-conjugated anti-CD7, anti-CD16, and anti-CD36 monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) were obtained from BD Biosciences). Anti-STAT1 and anti-phospho-STAT1 (Y701) rabbit polyclonal Abs were from Cell Signaling Technology, Inc. (Bioconcept, Allschwill, Switzerland). Anti-STAT2, anti-Jak1, anti-Jak2, and anti-IFNABR-1 rabbit polyclonal Abs were from Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc. (LabForce AG, Nunningen, Switzerland). We obtained the following rabbit polyclonal antibodies from Fitzgerald Industries International, Inc.

Anti-glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH) mAb was ordered from Chemicon International, Inc. (Temecula, CA). Horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary Ab was purchased from Amersham Biosciences. Horseradish peroxidase-conjugated goat anti-rabbit IgG, Fcγ-specific, was obtained from Jackson ImmunoResearch Laboratories, Milan Analytika, La Roche, Switzerland). Anti-phycoerythrin secondary Abs microbeads were from Miltenyi Biotec GmbH (Bergisch Gladbach, Germany). Phytohemagglutinin was from Roche Diagnostics. Propidium iodide and Sytox Orange were both obtained from Molecular Probes (distributed by Invitrogen). Unless stated otherwise, all other reagents were from Sigma. Cells—Immature neutrophils were isolated from bone marrow aspirates with normal cellular morphology and distribution as previously described (12Altznauer F. Martinelli S. Yousefi S. Thürig C.

Briefly, after centrifugation on a two-step discontinuous Percoll density gradient, cells were negatively isolated using anti-CD7 and anti-CD36 mAbs to eliminate contaminating lymphoid and erythroid precursors. The resulting cell population contained >97% cells of the neutrophil lineage as determined by MPO staining and analysis of lineage-associated surface proteins as well as with Diff-Quik (Medion GmbH, Düdingen, Switzerland) and light microscopy. Table I demonstrates the distribution of the different maturation stages within the immature neutrophil populations used in this study.

Weber M. Nikolaizik W.H. Vogt P. Schöni M.H. Blaser K. Simon H.-U. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 13330-13335Crossref PubMed Scopus (264) Google Scholar, 13Yousefi S. Green D.R. Blaser K.

Eosinophil contamination was always less than 2%. Written informed consent was obtained from all patients and control individuals who donated bone marrow aspirates and blood, respectively. The study was approved by the ethics committee of the Canton Bern. Cell Cultures—Human immature and mature neutrophils were cultured at 1 × 106/ml in complete culture medium (RPMI 1640 containing 10% fetal calf serum) in the presence and absence of GM-CSF (50 ng/ml), G-CSF (25 ng/ml), IFN-α (500 units/ml), and IFN-γ (250 units/ml) for the indicated time periods. Gene Expression Profiling—Total RNA was isolated using the TRIzol reagent (Invitrogen). Double-stranded cDNA was generated using a Superscript cDNA synthesis kit (Invitrogen) using an oligo(dT)24 primer containing a T7 RNA polymerase promoter at the 3′ end (Microsynth, Balgach, Switzerland). Labeled cRNA was prepared from double-stranded cDNA by in vitro transcription using a T7 polymerase (MEGAscript T7 kit, Ambion (Europe) Ltd., Huntingdon, UK) in the presence of biotin-11-CTP and biotin-16-UTP (Enzo Diagnostics, Farmingdale, NY) and purified using RNeasy columns (Qiagen AG, Basle, Switzerland). 15 μg of biotinylated cRNA were fragmented and hybridized to HG-U95Av2 GeneChip® arrays (Affymetrix, Santa Clara, CA) which contain probe sets representing ∼12,600 human genes. Chip hybridization, washing, and staining were performed according to the Affymetrix recommended protocols. Each array was performed in triplicate. After scanning of the probe arrays, digitalized image data were processed using Affymetrix Microarray Suite 5.0 software. In addition to determining the expression level for each gene (so called “signal”), this software assigns a “detection” call, absent (A) (not expressed), present (P) (expressed) and marginal (M) (marginally expressed) for each gene measured. The overall fluorescence intensity was scaled to a global intensity of 500 to enable the comparison between chips. Gene Array Data Analysis—The expression data for all genes were exported to GeneSpring 5.0 (Silicon Genetics, Redwood City, CA). The following criteria were used to select differentially expressed genes in immature versus mature neutrophils or in GM-CSF-treated versus not treated neutrophils: 1) Student's t test with a multiple testing correction (Benjamini-Hochberg) significance level p < 0.05; 2) fold-change cut-off of 4 (2 for GM-CSF treatment) in both directions; 3) the P calls had to coincide with the regulation in question, e.g. if a candidate gene were to be called “up-regulated” in mature (GM-CSF treated cells), triplicate samples in the “treated” group had to be called P, and vice versa, if a gene were to be called “down-regulated,” triplicate samples in the immature (untreated) group had to have a P call. The selected differentially expressed genes were normalized to a mean of 0 and a S.D. of 1, log2-transformed, and subjected to average-linkage hierarchical clustering using the uncentered Pearson similarity matrix (14Eisen M.B. Spellman P.T. Brown P.O. Botstein D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 14863-14868Crossref PubMed Scopus (13235) Google Scholar). Clustering analysis was performed using the GENE CLUSTER program, and the figures were generated with TREE VIEW program (14Eisen M.B. Spellman P.T. Brown P.O. Botstein D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

PCR amplifications were carried out using HotStart system (LightCycler Faststart DNA Master SYBR Green I, Roche Applied Science) on the LightCycler™ thermocycler as previously described (16Willers J.

Serially diluted plasmids with corresponding gene inserts were used to generate the standard curve and subsequently used to calculate the number of the target molecules per sample. Results were initially expressed as the absolute copy number/μl. To compensate the variations in quantity and quality of starting mRNA, the absolute gene copy numbers/μl were normalized by the absolute GAPDH mRNA copy number/μl.Table IIPrimers and PCR conditionsGene/PrimersSequenceAmplicon sizeAnnealing temperaturebp°CSTAT1 (forward)5′-TGT GGT GAT CTC CAA CGT CAG-3′11355STAT1 (reverse)5′-CAC ATG GTG GAG TCA GGA AGA-′STAT2 (forward)5′-GAG GCC TCA ACT CAG ACC AG-3′20056STAT2 (reverse)5′-GCG TCC ATC ATT CCA GAG AT-3′Jak1 (forward)5′-TGC TCC TGA GTG TGT TGA GG-3′19260Jak1 (reverse)5′-AGG TCA GCC AGC TCC TTA CA-3′Jak2 (forward)5′-TGG GCA GAA TTA GCA AAC CT-3′20060Jak2 (reverse)5′-TGT GTA GGA TCC CGG TCT TC-3′IFNABR-1 (forward)5′-TTG CTC TCC CGT TTG TCA TTT A-3′39560IFNABR-1 (reverse)5′-GAC CTC AGG CTC CCA GTG TAA C-3′IFNABR-2 (forward)5′-CCC TTA AAA TGC ACC CTC CT-3′20060IFNABR-2 (reverse)5′-GCA TTC CAG CCC TTA GTG AG-3′IFNGR-1 (forward)5′-TCC TCG ATT GTC TTC GGT ATG C-3′22560IFNGR-1 (reverse)5′-GTG CTT AGC CTG GTA TTC ATC TGT-3′IFNGR-2 (forward)5′-TGG GGT CAC CTC AAT GTT TTC T-3′10460IFNGR-2 (reverse)5′-TTC AAT GTC ACT CTA CGC CTT CG-3′GAPDHGAPDH quantification kit (Search LC, GmbH, Dossenheim, Germany) Open table in a new tab Gel Electrophoresis and Immunoblotting—Cells (1-2.5 × 106) were washed with phosphate-buffered saline and lysed with modified radioimmune precipitation assay buffer (0.25% sodium deoxycholate, 1% Nonidet P-40, 150 mm sodium chloride, 50 mm Tris, pH 7.4) supplemented with a protease inhibitor mixture (Sigma) and 10 μm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride (Roche Applied Science) on ice for 30 min (17Baumann R.

For phospho-STAT1 immunoblots, radioimmune precipitation assay buffer was used, which contained 1% Triton X-100. After a 10-min centrifugation to remove insoluble particles, loading buffer was added, and equal amounts of the cell lysates were loaded on NuPage gels (Invitrogen). Separated proteins were electrotransferred onto polyvinylidene difluoride membranes (Immobilon-P, Millipore, Volketswil, Switzerland) except for phospho-STAT1 immunoblots where we used Hybound-ECL nitrocellulose membranes (Amersham Biosciences). The filters were incubated overnight with anti-IFNABR-1 (1/500), anti-IFNABR-2 (1/2000), anti-IFNGR-1 (1/3000), anti-IFNGR-2 (1/1000), anti-Jak1 (1/500), anti-Jak2 (1/500), anti-STAT1 (1/1000), and anti-STAT2 (1/1000) Abs at 4 °C in Tris-buffered saline, 0.1% Tween 20, 3% nonfat dry milk. Anti-phospho-STAT1 Ab was diluted in 1% bovine serum albumin (essentially globulin-free, Sigma (A-7638)), Tris-buffered saline, 0.1% Tween 20 (1/1000). The final concentrations of the primary Abs ranged between 0.3 and 0.5 μg/ml. For loading controls stripped filters were incubated with anti-GAPDH (1/2000) mAbs. Filters were washed in Tris-buffered saline, 0.1% Tween 20 for 30 min and incubated with the appropriate horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary Ab in Tris-buffered saline, 0.1% Tween 20, 5% nonfat dry milk for 1 h. In the immunoprecipitation experiments blots were incubated with a horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary Ab recognizing the Fc fragment of the primary Ab only. Filters were developed by an ECL technique (ECL-Kit, Amersham Biosciences) according to the manufacturer's instructions. [32P]Phosphorylation of STAT1—Cells (2 × 107/ml) were preincubated for 2 h in phosphate-free medium (136 mm NaCl, 5.9 mm KCl, 1.2 mm MgSO4, 5.0 mm NaHCO3, 5.5 mm glucose, and 20 mm HEPES, pH 7.4) supplemented with 1 mCi/ml [32P]orthophosphate (Amersham Biosciences). Cells were washed and stimulated with IFN-α and IFN-γ in complete culture medium for 15 min. STAT1 was subsequently immunoprecipitated as described previously (19Eilers A. Georgellis D. Klose B. Schindler C. Ziemiecki A. Harpur A.G. Wilks A.F. Decker T. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 3579-3586Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). Because immature neutrophils had only little amounts of STAT1, we loaded three times larger volumes of immunocomplexes from immature than from mature cells on NuPage-Gels. The gels were analyzed using the imaging system Typhoon 9200 (Amersham Biosciences). Analysis of Neutrophil Extracellular Traps—Mature and immature neutrophils were seeded on poly-l-lysine 12-mm glass (BD Biosciences), allowed to settle, and then either primed with IFN-α, IFN-γ, or GM-CSF for 30 min with the concentrations indicated in Cell cultures. Cells were subsequently stimulated with 10-7m C5a for 10 min and fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde solution. RNAs were digested by addition of 1 mg/ml RNase in phosphate-buffered saline for 15 min at room temperature. For DNA detection slides were treated with 2.5 μg/ml propidium iodide. Specimens were washed with phosphate-buffered saline and mounted in a drop of anti-bleaching mounting medium (5% 1,4-diazabicyclo-[2.2.2]octane, 11% glycerol, 22% polyvinyl alcohol, 56 mm Tris-HCl, pH 9.0) and analyzed with a confocal laser scanning microscope (LSM 510, Carl Zeiss). To quantify DNA release, neutrophils were seeded into 96-well plates (Greiner Bio-One GmbH, Frickenhausen, Germany) and stimulated under the same conditions as described above. Five μm Sytox Orange, a non cell-permeable DNA binding dye, was added (11Brinkmann V. Reichard U. Goosmann C. Fauler B. Uhlemann Y. Weiss D.S. Weinrauch Y. Zychlinsky A. Science. 2004; 303: 1532-1535Crossref PubMed Scopus (6220) Google Scholar). The plates were read using the imaging system Typhoon 9200 using a filter setting of 532 nm (excitation)/580 nm (emission) and TotalLab software (Amersham Biosciences). In addition, plates were analyzed by light microscopy and photographed. For MPO release analysis the same protocol for cell activation was used. Released MPO was measured in the supernatants by spectroscopy (20Krawisz J.E. Sharon P. Stenson W.F. Gastroenterology. 1984; 87: 1344-1350Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1626) Google Scholar). Briefly, 10 μl of supernatant and 10 μl of 20 mg/ml o-dianisidine were added to 155 μl of 100 mm potassium phosphate buffer, pH 6.0, containing 0.5% hexadecyltrimethylammonium bromide. The reaction was started by adding 25 μl of 2 mm hydrogen peroxide solution. Absorbance of 450 nm of visible light was measured at 37 °C for 20-30 min. MPO concentrations were calculated using an MPO standard. Proliferation Assay—Proliferation of immature neutrophils was induced by GM-CSF or G-CSF in complete culture medium. As control PBMC were stimulated with 10 μg/ml phytohemagglutinin. These proliferation assays were carried out in the presence and absence of interferons (IFN-α and IFN-γ). Total culture times were 72 h (immature neutrophils) and 48 h (PBMC), respectively, and pulsing the cells with 1 μCi/ml [methyl-3H]thymidine (Amersham Biosciences) was always performed for 16 h. [3H]Thymidine incorporation was measured by using a liquid scintillation counter (Wallac ADL, Hünenberg, Switzerland (21Simon H.-U. Yousefi S. Dommann-Scherrer C.C. Zimmermann D.R. Bauer S. Barandun J. Blaser K. J. Exp. Med. 1996; 183: 1071-1082Crossref PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar)). Statistical Analysis—Besides the gene array data, results are expressed either as single data (usually triplicate experiments) or as the means ± S.E. for the indicated number of independent experiments. Student's t test was used to identify statistical significant differences. The calculated p values are indicated in the figures. Differentially Expressed Genes in Immature Versus Mature Human Neutrophils—To gain an understanding of the molecular processes that occur during differentiation and infection in neutrophils, we screened 12,599 genes for changes in gene expression using the following neutrophil populations: 1) immature neutrophils isolated from bone marrow aspirates, 2) mature neutrophils isolated from peripheral blood, and 3) mature neutrophils stimulated in vitro with GM-CSF for 7 h. Based on our filtering criteria, we identified 1049 genes that were differentially transcribed in immature and mature neutrophils (459 genes up-regulated and 590 down-regulated in immature cells). To facilitate further analysis, each gene was assigned to a defined functional category according to available annotations (NetAffx). As shown in Table III, immature neutrophils showed preferential expression of genes involved in protein biosynthesis, metabolism, and transcriptional control as well as in cell cycle, mitosis, and proliferation. In contrast, mature neutrophils appeared to up-regulate genes that regulate signal transduction, inflammatory responses, transcription, and apoptosis.Table IIIFunctional grouping of genes differentially regulated in immature versus mature neutrophils obtained by screening NetAffx™ annotation database (www.affymetrix.com/analysis/index.affx)Functional categoryNumbers of up-regulated genesImmature neutrophilsProtein biosynthesis58Metabolism44Cell cycle39Control of transcription29Immune/inflammatory response23Mitosis21Signal transduction13Proliferation13DNA repair11Cell growth9Organ development8Cell adhesion8Apoptosis/cell death7Anti-proliferative5Cell-cell signaling2Anti-apoptosis2Chemotaxis1Mature neutrophilsSignal transduction97Immune/inflammatory response72Control of transcription60Apoptosis/cell death37Cell growth30Organ development27Metabolism26Cell cycle24Cell adhesion24Proliferation23Cell-cell signaling17Chemotaxis9Anti-proliferative7Anti-apoptosis7Mitosis4DNA repair4Protein biosynthesis2 Open table in a new tab A detailed analysis of neutrophil lineage-associated genes suggested high mRNA expression of azurocidin 1, neutrophil elastase 2, bactericidal/permeability-increasing protein, lipocalin 2, MPO, cathepsin G, and neutrophil collagenase as well as the defensins α3 and α4 in immature neutrophils. In contrast, the transcriptional activity of mature neutrophils apparently switched to particularly produce receptors for antibodies, chemokines, and cytokines (Table IV). As expected, CD16, a transcript associated with later stages of neutrophil differentiation, was relatively more abundant in mature as compared with immature neutrophils. In contrast, CD33, a marker of immature cells, was indeed much higher expressed in immature compared with terminally differentiated neutrophils (data not shown).Table IVRelative expression levels of neutrophil-specific genes in immature versus mature neutrophilsAcc"
https://openalex.org/W1963643013,"Bone marrow mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) can differentiate into different types of cells and have tremendous potential for cell therapy and tissue engineering. Transforming growth factor β1 (TGF-β) plays an important role in cell differentiation and vascular remodeling. We showed that TGF-β induced cell morphology change and an increase in actin fibers in MSCs. To determine the global effects of TGF-β on MSCs, we employed a proteomic strategy to analyze the effect of TGF-β on the human MSC proteome. By using two-dimensional gel electrophoresis and electrospray ionization coupled to quadrupole/time-of-flight tandem mass spectrometers, we have generated a proteome reference map of MSCs, and we identified ∼30 proteins with an increase or decrease in expression or phosphorylation in response to TGF-β. The proteins regulated by TGF-β included cytoskeletal proteins, matrix synthesis proteins, membrane proteins, metabolic enzymes, etc. TGF-β increased the expression of smooth muscle α-actin and decreased the expression of gelsolin. Overexpression of gelsolin inhibited TGF-β-induced assembly of smooth muscle α-actin; on the other hand, knocking down gelsolin expression enhanced the assembly of α-actin and actin filaments without significantly affecting α-actin expression. These results suggest that TGF-β coordinates the increase of α-actin and the decrease of gelsolin to promote MSC differentiation. This study demonstrates that proteomic tools are valuable in studying stem cell differentiation and elucidating the underlying molecular mechanisms.

MSCs can be expanded in culture and differentiate into a variety of cell types such as osteoblasts, chondrocytes, adipocytes, skeletal muscle cells, and smooth muscle cells (SMCs) in response to different microenvironmental cues (1Caplan A.I.

MSCs transplanted into the heart can differentiate into SMCs and contribute to the remodeling of vasculature (8Gojo S. Gojo N. Takeda Y. Mori T. Abe H. Kyo S. Hata J. Umezawa A. Exp.

However, the effects of vascular microenvironmental factors on MSC differentiation into SMCs and the underlying molecular mechanisms are not well understood. Transforming growth factor-β1 (TGF-β) proteins are multifunctional proteins that regulate cell growth, differentiation, migration, and extracellular matrix production (10Topper J.N. Trends Cardiovasc. Med. 2000; 10: 132-137Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar, 11Massague J. Wotton D. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 1745-1754Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 12Moustakas A.

It was shown recently (15Kinner B. Zaleskas J.M. Spector M. Exp. Cell Res. 2002; 278: 72-83Crossref PubMed Scopus (216) Google Scholar) that TGF-β increases smooth muscle (SM) α-actin expression in MSCs. In contrast, TGF-β induces chondrogenic differentiation of MSCs in the presence of dexamethasone or three-dimensional cell aggregates (16Johnstone B. Hering T.M. Caplan A.I. Goldberg V.M. Yoo J.U. Exp. Cell Res. 1998; 238: 265-272Crossref PubMed Scopus (2019) Google Scholar, 17Mackay A.M. Beck S.C. Murphy J.M. Barry F.P. Chichester C.O. Pittenger M.F. Tissue Eng. 1998; 4: 415-428Crossref PubMed Scopus (1104) Google Scholar). These results indicate that the effects of TGF-β on MSC differentiation depend on other microenvironmental factors. To elucidate the molecular mechanism in TGF-β-induced MSC differentiation, we investigated the TGF-β-induced proteome changes in MSCs. Proteome, the entire protein complement of the genome, determines cell phenotype and functions. With conventional molecular biological approaches, studies on the regulation of protein expression and activity can only be conducted on a limited number of proteins and on a protein-by-protein basis. Proteomics provides a systematic approach for the quantitative and qualitative mapping of the whole proteome (18Patterson S.D. Aebersold R.H. Nat. Genet. 2003; 33: 311-323Crossref PubMed Scopus (558) Google Scholar, 19Blackstock W.P. Weir M.P. Trends Biotechnol. 1999; 17: 121-127Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (728) Google Scholar). Rapid technology developments in two-dimensional electrophoresis, capillary/nano-high pressure liquid chromatography, mass spectrometry (MS), bioinformatics, and protein microarrays have greatly advanced proteome characterization and biomarker discovery (18Patterson S.D.

Two-dimensional electrophoresis separates proteins by isoelectric focusing (IEF) and SDS-PAGE. Two-dimensional electrophoresis offers better visualization of the whole proteome and hence the ease of subsequent comparison and characterization in addition to its lower cost. To date, two-dimensional electrophoresis still remains the central technology in proteomics for separation and differential comparison of thousands of proteins in a complex mixture (21Rabilloud T. Proteomics. 2002; 2: 3-10Crossref PubMed Scopus (666) Google Scholar, 25Witzmann F.A. Li J. Am. J. Physiol. 2002; 282: G735-G741Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar, 26Lilley K.S. Razzaq A. Dupree P. Curr. Opin. Chem. Biol. 2002; 6: 46-50Crossref PubMed Scopus (217) Google Scholar). Proteins separated by two-dimensional electrophoresis can be digested and analyzed by MS, e.g. using matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization (MALDI) or electrospray ionization (ESI) coupled to quadrupole/time-of-flight (Q-TOF) mass analyzers or triple-quadrupole tandem mass spectrometers (MS/MS). MS/MS spectra can be used to determine the peptide sequence with high specificity (18Patterson S.D. Aebersold R.H. Nat. Genet. 2003; 33: 311-323Crossref PubMed Scopus (558) Google Scholar, 22MacCoss M.J. Yates III, J.R. Curr. Opin. Clin. Nutr. Metab. Care. 2001; 4: 369-375Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). In this study, we used ESI-MS/MS to identify proteins in two-dimensional gels. A preliminary two-dimensional reference map of MSCs was generated, and about 30 TGF-β-regulated proteins with changes at the expression level and/or post-translational modifications were identified. We showed that TGF-β coordinated the increase of SM α-actin and the decrease of gelsolin to promote the assembly of α-actin and actin filaments in MSCs. These results from proteomic profiling will not only provide insight into the global responses of MSCs to TGF-β stimulation but will also lead to in-depth studies on the mechanisms of proteomic changes in MSCs. Cell Culture—Human bone marrow MSCs were obtained from Cambrex Corp. (Walkersville, MD). These MSCs had been well characterized by their surface markers and differentiation potential. They are positive for CD105, CD166, CD29, and CD44 but negative for CD34, CD14, and CD45. MSCs were cultured in MSCGM medium with prescreened fetal bovine serum (Cambrex Corp.) to allow for cell proliferation without differentiation. The cells were maintained in humidified incubators at 37 °C with 5% CO2. Cell culture products and other consumable laboratory supplies were purchased from Fisher and VWR International (Brisbane, CA). MSCs up to passage 10 were used in our experiments. Flow Cytometry—To confirm that MSCs maintain their phenotype after expansion in culture, the cells were subjected to flow cytometry analysis. The cells were detached by trypsin treatment, followed by centrifugation and washing with PBS. After resuspension of the cells, the nonspecific binding sites were blocked by incubation with 1% bovine serum albumin (Sigma) for 30 min. For primary antibodies conjugated with FITC (CD14, CD34, CD45, CD105, and CD166), the samples were incubated with the primary antibody for 30 min, and the expression level of each surface marker was quantified by using a Beckman Coulter EPICS XL flow cytometer. For primary antibodies without FITC conjugation (CD29 and CD44), the samples were incubated with an antibody against each of the surface markers for 30 min and stained with a FITC-conjugated secondary antibody (Molecular Probes, Eugene, OR) for 30 min, followed by flow cytometry analysis. As negative controls, cells were incubated only with the FITC-conjugated secondary antibody. The antibodies against the surface markers CD14 and CD45 were from Santa Cruz Biotechnologies (Santa Cruz, CA). CD34 antibody was from BD Biosciences. CD29 and CD105 antibodies were from Chemicon (Temecula, CA). CD166 antibody was from Serotec (Raleigh, NC). CD44 antibody was from BIOSOURCE (Camarillo, CA). Chemicals and TGF-β Treatment—Chemicals were purchased from Sigma unless otherwise specified. TGF-β1 (Sigma) at 10 ng/ml was used to treat MSCs. Our pilot experiments showed that TGF-β1 at 5 and 20 ng/ml induced similar levels of SM α-actin and collagen I expression in MSCs. For long term culture, TGF-β1 was supplemented when cultured medium was changed (every 2–3 days). Cell Staining and Microscopy—The phase contrast images of MSC morphology were collected by using a Nikon inverted microscope (TE300) with 10× objective and a Hamamatsu Orca100 cooled digital CCD camera. The images were transferred directly from a frame grabber to the computer storage using C-Imaging System software (Compix Inc., Cranberry Township, PA). Immunostaining and confocal microscopy were used to determine the subcellular distribution and organization of the proteins. MSCs were fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) for 15 min, followed by permeabilization with 0.5% Triton X-100 in PBS for 10 min. For immunostaining, the specimens were incubated with the primary antibody against gelsolin (from BD Biosciences), α-actin, or FLAG tag (Sigma) for 2 h and with FITC- or rhodamine-conjugated secondary antibody (Jackson ImmunoResearch, West Grove, PA) for 1 h. To stain F-actin filaments, the specimen was incubated with rhodamine-phalloidin for 30 min, followed by confocal microscopy. The images of the specimen were collected as Z series sections with a Leica TCL SL confocal microscopy system equipped with argon and He/Ne laser sources, a scanner, and a Leica DM IRB microscope. Multiple sections (0.3 μm thick for each section) were projected onto one plane for presentation. Immunoblotting Analysis of Proteins—To prepare cell lysates for SDS-PAGE, the cells were lysed in a lysis buffer containing 25 mm Tris, pH 7.4, 0.5 m NaCl, 1% Triton X-100, 0.1% SDS, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 10 μg/ml leupeptin, and 1 mm Na3VO4. The lysates were centrifuged at 12,000 rpm by using a microcentrifuge, and the protein concentration of the supernatants was measured by using a DC protein assay (Bio-Rad). The proteins were run in SDS-PAGE and transferred to a nitrocellulose membrane, which was blocked with 3% nonfat milk and incubated with the primary antibody in TTBS buffer (25 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 60 mm NaCl, and 0.05% Tween 20) containing 0.1% bovine serum albumin. The bound primary antibodies were detected by using a goat anti-mouse or a goat anti-rabbit IgG-horseradish peroxidase conjugate (Santa Cruz Biotechnologies, Santa Cruz, CA) and the ECL detection system (Amersham Biosciences). The immunoblotting results were scanned with a Hewlett Packard high resolution scanner, and the intensity of protein bands were quantified by using NIH Image software. The monoclonal antibody against gelsolin was from BD Biosciences. The antibodies against actin (including all isoforms) and tubulin were from Santa Cruz Biotechnologies. The antibodies against α-actin (monoclonal) and FLAG tag (polyclonal) were from Sigma. The antibody against HSP27 was from Stressgen Biotechnologies Corp. (Victoria, British Columbia, Canada). Cell Lysis and Two-dimensional Gel Electrophoresis—Cells were washed three times using ice-cold PBS buffer and centrifuged down at 3000 rpm for 5 min. Residual PBS buffer on top was removed by careful pipetting. Cells were then disrupted with lysis buffer, which is a mixture of 7 m urea, 2 m thiourea, 4% CHAPS, 40 mm Tris (Tris base), and 20 mm DTT. Normally 1 ml of lysis buffer was used for 1–2 × 107 cells. Upon addition of lysis buffer, cells were immediately pipetted up and down several times to mix well. Samples were allowed to stand at room temperature for about 1 h and vortexed occasionally. They were transferred to Beckman thick wall tubes (362305) and centrifuged at 66,000 rpm (100,000 × g) in a Beckman TLA100.4 rotor for 30 min at 20 °C. Supernatant were aliquoted into siliconized tubes (PGC Scientifics, Frederick, MD) and stored at –80 °C. Modified Bradford assay (Bio-Rad) was used to quantify the total protein amount in the cell lysates. The first-dimension IEF was performed by using an Ettan IPGphor unit (Amersham Biosciences) with a power supply EPS 3501XL. Precast 18-cm, pH 3–10, NL IPG strips were obtained from Amersham Biosciences. 100 μg of lysate mixtures in triplicate were supplemented with rehydration solution (7 m urea, 2 m thiourea, 2% CHAPS, trace of bromphenol blue, 20 mm DTT, and 0.5% corresponding IPG buffer) to a final volume of 350 μl. IPG strips were then rehydrated with the sample mixture in a strip holder for 24 h. IEF was carried out in three steps under step-n-hold mode as follows: (i) 500 V, 1.0 h; (ii) 1000 V, 3 h; and (iii) 8,000 V, 8 h. The total voltage-hour applied was 67,000. The second-dimension SDS-PAGE was carried out in an Ettan DALTsix system (Amersham Biosciences). IPG strips were equilibrated in two consecutive steps: (i) 30 min in 10 mg/ml of DTT; and (ii) 30 min in 25 mg/ml iodoacetamide (Sigma), both dissolved in SDS equilibration buffer (50 mm Tris base, 6 m urea, 30% glycerol (v/v), 2% SDS (w/v), and trace bromphenol blue). 1-mm-thick 10% polyacrylamide gels with a dimension of 27.5 × 21 cm were cast with 30% Duracryl, 0.65% Bis (Genomic Solutions, Ann Arbor, MI), 10% SDS, 10% ammonium persulfate, and 0.375 m Tris buffer at pH 8.8. IPG strips were sealed on the top of gels with 0.5% SeaKem LE-agarose (Cambrex Corp.). SDS-PAGE was performed at a constant voltage of 100 V at 10 °C and stopped once the bromphenol blue front disappeared from the gel. Silver Staining and Image Analysis—Proteins on gels were visualized by using silver staining performed with minor modifications to published procedures (27Shevchenko A. Wilm M. Vorm O. Mann M. Anal. Chem. 1996; 68: 850-858Crossref PubMed Scopus (7784) Google Scholar). Briefly, gels were fixed in 50% methanol, 5% acetic acid for at least 2 h followed by a 20-min washing in 50% methanol. Gels were washed twice with ddH2O for 15 min, treated with 0.02% Na2S2O3 for 3 min, and rinsed twice with ddH2O for 1 min before incubation in 0.1% silver nitrate for 30 min. After silver staining the gels were rinsed twice with ddH2O for 2 min and shaken vigorously in developer containing 0.04% formalin (37% formaldehyde in water) and 2% Na2CO3. After 30 s, the developer was discarded, and gels were shaken in fresh developer until the desired intensity was attained (∼3 min). Incubation in 5% acetic acid for 5 min terminated development after which gels were rinsed three times with ddH2O for 2 min prior to imaging. For long term storage, gels were incubated with 1% acetic acid at 4 °C. Stained gels were imaged with an Umax PowerLook 1100 scanner (Umax Technologies, Dallas, TX) with a defined scan resolution of 250 dpi in the transmissive and gray blue mode. Protein expression with and without TGF-β treatment was compared using Z3 3.0 software (Compugen, Tel Aviv, Israel). All gel images were cropped to the same dimensions and auto-contrasted in Photoshop 7.0 prior to image analysis. Multiple gel analysis wizard was applied to compare the two groups of three gels each. Spot detection and matching were achieved initially automatically and were fine-tuned by manual registration. Spurious spots were excluded by manual annotation. To define spots with differential expression, the settings used are as follows: spot contrast of 8, minimum confidence level of 0.95, and minimum spot area (pixels) of 50. Protein spots that were determined to be differentially expressed (n-fold more than 2.0 or less than 0.5) using the automatic analyses were verified manually by local pattern comparison to exclude artifacts. In-gel Tryptic Digestion and Peptide Extraction—To identify differentially expressed proteins, the spots were excised from the gels manually and digested with trypsin. Gel spots were diced into small pieces (1 mm2) and placed into 0.65-ml siliconized tubes. 100 μl (or enough to cover) of 50 mm NH4HCO3, 50% acetonitrile was added, and the tube was vortexed for 10 min. After a brief spin, the supernatant was discarded with gel-loading pipette tips. The washing step was repeated twice. Gel pieces were then brought to complete dryness with a Savant SpeedVac. 5 ng/μl trypsin (Promega, Madison, WI) freshly prepared in 50 mm NH4HCO3 was added to just barely cover the gel pieces. The trypsin solution added was about 3× the volume of dry gel volume estimated, and on average 20 μl was sufficient. The gel pieces were allowed to stand and to swell for 10 min under room temperature. They were then kept on ice for 30 min. Extra trypsin solution was discarded by pipetting to reduce trypsin autolysis. Finally 30 μl of 25 mm NH4HCO3 was gently overlaid on top, and the tubes were incubated at 37 °C overnight (16–20 h). To extract the peptides from the gel pieces, 30 μl of ddH2O was added, and the tube was vortexed for 10 min followed by sonication in a water bath for 5 min. The aqueous portion was transferred to a clean siliconized tube. Peptides were further extracted twice with 30 μl of 50% acetonitrile, 5% formic acid, and supernatants were combined. The total volume was reduced to ∼5 μl by using the SpeedVac. The resultant samples were then subjected to Q-TOF mass spectrometry directly or stored at –20 °C freezer for future analysis. Protein Identification by LC-MS/MS—A hybrid quadrupole/orthogonal time-of-flight mass spectrometer, Q-TOF API US (Waters) interfaced with a capillary liquid chromatography system (Waters), was used to carry out LC-MS/MS analysis. 1–2 μl of samples were injected through an auto-sampler into the LC system at the flow rate of 20 μl/min and pre-concentrated on a 300-μm × 5-mm PepMap C18 precolumn (Dionex, CA). The peptides were then eluted onto a 75-μm × 15-cm PepMap C18 analytical column. The column was equilibrated with solution A (3% acetonitrile, 97% water, 0.1% formic acid), and the peptide separation was achieved with a solution gradient from 3 to 40% of solution B (95% acetonitrile, 5% water, 0.1% formic acid) over 35 min at a flow rate of 250 nl/min. This flow rate through the column was reduced from 8 μl/min from pumps A and B by flow splitting. The LC eluent was directed to the electrospray source with a PicoTip emitter (New Objectives, Woburn, MA). The mass spectrometer was operated in positive ion mode with a source temperature of 100 °C and a cone voltage of 40 V. A voltage of 2 kV was applied to the PicoTip. TOF analyzer was set in the V-mode. The instrument was calibrated with a multipoint calibration by using selected fragment ions from the collision-induced decomposition of Glu-fibrinopeptide B. MS/MS spectra were obtained in a data-dependent acquisition mode in which the three multiple-charged (+2, +3, and +4) peaks with the highest intensity in each MS scan were chosen for collision-induced decomposition. Collision energies were set at 10 and 30 V, respectively, during the MS and MS/MS scans. Mass spectra were processed by using MassLynx 4.0 software, and proteins were identified by using Protein Global Server 1.0/2.0 software. The protein identities were further confirmed by Mascot (www.matrixscience.com) by using the MS/MS peak lists exported from MassLynx. The nonredundant data bases in the molecular mass range of 1,000–500,000 Da and pI values between 3.0 and 10.0 were used at the NCBI website. Modifications considered included carbamidomethylation of cysteine, amino-terminal acetylation, amino-terminal Gln to pyro-Glu, oxidation of methionine, and phosphorylation of serine, threonine, and tyrosine. RNA Isolation and Quantitative PCR (qPCR)—Cells in each well in 6-well plates were lysed with 0.5 ml of RNA Stat 60 (Tel-Test Inc, Friendswood, TX). RNA was extracted using chloroform and phenol extraction steps. Samples were centrifuged inbetween each of these steps for 15 min at 4 °C at 12,000 rpm. Isopropyl alcohol was added to precipitate the RNA, and the samples were centrifuged for 30 min under the same conditions. 75% ethanol was added to wash the RNA pellet and centrifuged at 7500 rpm for 5 min. The pellet was resuspended in 20 μl of diethyl pyrocarbonate-treated water and quantified by using a RiboGreen® RNA quantification assay (Molecular Probes Inc, Eugene, OR). Two-step reverse transcription (RT)-PCR was performed by using the ThermoScript RT-PCR system for first-strand cDNA synthesis (Invitrogen). The cDNA was made from equal amounts of total RNA from each sample, and qPCR was performed by using SYBR green kits and the ABI Prism® 7000 Sequence Detection System (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA) (28Li S. Lao J.M. Chen B.P.C. Li Y.S. Zhao Y.H. Chu J. Chen K.D. Tsou T.C. Peck K. Chien S. FASEB J. 2002; 16: U346-U370Google Scholar). Primers for SM α-actin, gelsolin, and 18 S were designed by using the ABI Prism Primer Express™ software version 2.0 (Applied Biosystems). Complete genomic sequences and the mRNA sequence were downloaded from the NCBI website (www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/LocusLink) to identify the intron-exon junctions. The primers that span an exon-exon junction were used to ensure the specific amplification of cDNA. The sequences of the designed primers were used to BLAST against nucleotide sequences in the NCBI data base (www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/BLAST/) to make sure that the primer sequences were unique. The primers used in this study are listed in Table I.Table IPrimers used in qPCRGene nameForward primer (5′ to 3′)Reverse primer (5′ to 3′)SM α-actinACCCTGCTCACGGAGGCGTCTCAAACATAATTTGAGTCATTTTCTCGelsolinTTGACTTCTGCTAAGCGGTACATCGGCTCAAAGCCTTGCTTCAC18 SCGCAGCTAGGAATAATGGAATAGGCATGGCCTCAGTTCCGAAA Open table in a new tab After each experiment, the melting temperature and the dissociation curve of PCR products were obtained to confirm the product specificity. The amount of RNA for each gene was normalized with the amount of 18 S RNA in the same sample. Transfection of DNA Plasmids and Small Interfering RNA (siRNA)— PCR was used to engineer the FLAG-tagged gelsolin construct by inserting the gelsolin cDNA beginning with the second codon immediately following the FLAG nucleotide sequence (GACTACAAGGATGACGATGACAAG) in the pCMV5b vector. MSCs were seeded in serum-free medium, and the DNA plasmids (2 μg for 10-cm2 culture area) were transfected into MSCs by using the LipofectAMINE PLUS reagent (Invitrogen). After incubation with the mixture of plasmids and LipofectAMINE reagents for 5 h, the cells were cultured for 1 day and treated with TGF-β or kept as control. The expression efficiency of DNA plasmids was about 20%. SiRNA for gelsolin was from Dharmacon Inc. (Lafayette, CO). The FITC-conjugated control siRNA was from Cell Signaling Technology, Inc. (Beverly, MA). The siRNAs (100 nm for 10-cm2 culture area) were transfected into MSCs by using LipofectAMINE 2000. The transfection efficiency of siRNA was more than 90%. Characterization of MSCs—We used MSCs up to passage 10 in our experiments. To confirm that expanded MSCs maintain their phenotype, MSCs were stained for a set of cell surface markers. As shown in Fig. 1, MSCs at passage 10 were positive for CD105, CD166, CD29, and CD44 but were negative for CD14, CD45, and CD34, suggesting that expanded MSCs maintain their phenotype. To further prove that expanded MSCs had pluripotent differentiation potential, MSCs at passage 10 were tested for the differentiation into chondrogenic cells and osteogenic cells by following the instructions supplied by the manufacturer. MSCs cultured as a three-dimensional pellet in chondrogenic media for 2 weeks showed a round shape and synthesized large amounts of glycosaminoglycans, suggesting the differentiation of MSCs into chondrogenic cells (data not shown). MSCs in osteogenic media for 2 weeks showed matrix mineralization by Alizarin Red stain (data not shown), suggesting the differentiation of MSCs into osteogenic cells. TGF-β Induced Morphological Changes, Increased Actin Filaments, and Increased SM α-Actin Expression—Long term treatment of MSCs with TGF-β significantly changed the cell morphology. As shown in Fig. 2, 2 days after TGF-β treatment, MSCs have a more spread out and myoblast-like morphology, and intracellular fibrous structures were visible (indicated by arrows in Fig. 2B). This cell morphology was maintained as the cells grew and reached confluence after 6 days (Fig. 2F). To determine whether the intracellular fibrous structure was actin cytoskeleton, MSCs were stained on actin filaments. Indeed, MSCs trea"

This protein is essential for E. coli growth and is highly conserved in Gram-negative bacteria (18Karow M. Georgopoulos C. Mol. Microbiol. 1993; 7: 69-79Crossref PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar).

There is considerable disagreement in the literature concerning the mechanism of trans-bilayer lipid movement.

Hrafnsdottir et al. (14Hrafnsdottir S. Menon A.K. J.

The ATPase activity that is associated with purified MsbA is greatly stimulated by lipids (26Doerrler W.T. Raetz C.R.H. J. Biol.

These results provided the first direct evidence that rapid movement of some lipids across the inner membrane of E. coli is dependent upon MsbA. Materials—Tryptone and yeast extract were from Difco. Radioisotopes were purchased from PerkinElmer Life Sciences.

Total protein was measured with the BCA assay (30Smith P.K. Krohn R.I. Hermanson G.T. Mallia A.K. Gartner F.H. Provenzano M.D. Fujimoto E.K. Goeke N.M. Olson B.J. Klenk D.C. Anal.

Sulfo-NHS-biotin and TNBS Modification of Newly Synthesized PE—Overnight cultures of W3110A and mutant WD2 cells were diluted 1:100 into LB broth, pH 7.0. Cells were grown with shaking at 30 °C until a cell density (A600) of 0.5-1.0 was reached. Cells were then diluted 1:4 into 10 ml of LB broth, pre-warmed to 44 °C, and grown with shaking for another 30 min. Next, 1 μCi/ml 32Pi was added, and the cells were grown for an additional 10 min. Flasks were cooled on ice, and the cells were collected by centrifugation for 10 min at 4000 × g at 2 °C. For sulfo-NHS-biotin modification of PE, the cells were washed twice with ice-cold 10 mm Tris chloride, pH 8.6, containing 140 mm NaCl. The washed pellet was then resuspended in 4 ml of the same buffer at 0 °C. Sulfo-NHS-biotin was added at a final concentration of 0-2 mg/ml, as indicated, and the cells were incubated on ice for 0-4 h. Reactions were quenched by the addition of 50 mm glycine, and the cells were collected in a microcentrifuge. For the TNBS modification of PE, the cell pellet was washed twice with ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline. The washed pellet was resuspended in 10 ml of cold 50 mm NaHCO3, pH 8.5, containing 100 mm NaCl. The TNBS was added to give a final concentration of 3 mm by dilution from a fresh 5% commercial stock solution (Sigma) in water, and the cells were incubated on ice. The reaction was stopped at indicated times by addition of 50 μl of 5% bovine serum albumin and 200 μl of 30% trichloroacetic acid/ml of cells. The cells were collected using a microcentrifuge. For the separation of TNBS-modified membranes by isopyknic sucrose density gradient ultracentrifugation, 32Pi-labeled cells were incubated in the presence of 3 mm TNBS on ice for 90 min. The reaction was stopped by the addition of an equal volume of 20 mm Tris chloride, pH 8.0, in 1% bovine serum albumin without trichloroacetic acid, and the membranes were prepared (10Doerrler W.T.

Glycerophospholipids present in cell pellets or sucrose density gradient fractions were extracted using a single phase Bligh-Dyer mixture consisting of chloroform:methanol:H2O (1:2:0.8, v/v) but without the prior mild acid treatment described above, which is used to release lipid A from LPS. Insoluble material was removed by centrifugation for 5 min at 20,000 × g in a microcentrifuge, and the supernatant was removed and converted to a two phase system by the addition of chloroform and water (final chloroform:methanol:H2O ratio of 2:2:1.8, v/v). Following a brief centrifugation to separate the phases, the upper phase was removed and discarded, and the lower phase was washed with a fresh pre-equilibrated upper phase. The lower phase was dried, redissolved in a small volume of chloroform:methanol (4:1, v/v), and spotted onto a Silica Gel 60 TLC (Merck). Sulfo-NHS-biotin-modified lipids were resolved in chloroform:methanol:acetic acid:H2O (25:15:4:2, v/v), and TNBS-modified lipids were resolved in chloroform:methanol:H2O (65:25:4, v/v). Radioactive phospholipids were detected using a PhosphorImager and quantified using IQMac software. Lipid A Modification with Phosphoethanolamine and Aminoarabinose Requires MsbA—Earlier studies of the temperature-sensitive MsbA mutant WD2 demonstrated the accumulation of newly synthesized phospholipids and lipid A in the inner membrane following inactivation of MsbA at 44 °C (10Doerrler W.T. Reedy M.C. Raetz C.R.H. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 11461-11464Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (182) Google Scholar). These findings are consistent with two alternative mechanisms. In one scenario, MsbA catalyzes the trans-bilayer movement of newly synthesized lipids (Fig. 1A, the “flip-flop” model). In this case, newly synthesized lipids would accumulate on the inner face of the inner membrane upon inactivation of MsbA. Alternatively, MsbA could catalyze the ejection of lipids from the outer face of the inner membrane. In the latter case, lipid flip-flop could occur by a different (as yet unknown) mechanism, and it might be MsbA-independent (Fig. 1B, the “ejection” model). The second scenario is similar to the proposed mechanism of action for the lipoprotein transporter LolCDE (37Yakushi T. Masuda K. Narita S. Matsuyama S. Tokuda H. Nat. Cell Biol. 2000; 2: 212-218Crossref PubMed Scopus (209) Google Scholar). Polymyxin-resistant mutants of E. coli, such as WD101, harbor a mutation (designated pmrAC) that constitutively activates the PmrA transcription factor (31Trent M.S. Ribeiro A.A. Lin S. Cotter R.J. Raetz C.R.H. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 43122-43131Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (246) Google Scholar, 32Trent M.S. Ribeiro A.A. Doerrler W.T. Lin S. Cotter R.J. Raetz C.R.H. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 43132-43144Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar). PmrA is required for the production of several enzymes needed for the synthesis and attachment of aminoarabinose and phosphoethanolamine groups to lipid A (Fig. 2, blue substituents). These amine-containing substituents reduce the net negative charge of the cell surface and decrease its affinity for cationic anti-microbial peptides, including polymyxin (31Trent M.S. Ribeiro A.A.

Raetz C.R.H. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 43132-43144Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar). As explained in the legend to Fig. 2, the addition of aminoarabinose and phosphoethanolamine groups are catalyzed by distinct enzymes (ArnT and EptA/PmrC, respectively), 2PmrC is an older designation for the enzyme EptA and should not be confused with the constitutively active version of the transcription factor, PmrAC. which face the periplasmic surface of the inner membrane (31Trent M.S.

These modifications should require the flip-flop of lipid A from the cytoplasmic to the periplasmic surface of the inner membrane and therefore are markers for the trans-membrane movement of newly synthesized lipid A. To examine the accessibility of newly made lipid A to ArnT and EptA/PmrC, we constructed strain WD201, which carries the temperature-sensitive msbA allele of WD2 together with the polymyxin resistance gene (pmrAC) of WD101 (Table I). WD101 and WD201 were pulse-labeled for 10 min with 32Pi following 30 min of growth at 44 °C to inactivate MsbA in WD201. Cells were harvested, and inner and outer membranes were separated by isopyknic sucrose gradient ultracentrifugation. Glycerophospholipids and lipid A molecules present in each fraction were extracted, separated by TLC, and visualized using a PhosphorImager. As shown in Fig. 3, A and B, sucrose gradient ultracentrifugation efficiently separated the outer and inner membranes of both strains as judged by marker enzyme assays. As seen in Fig. 3, C and E, the analysis of fractions from the polymyxin-resistant strain WD101(pmrAC) revealed that glycerophospholipids are evenly distributed between the outer and inner membranes, similar to what is seen in wild-type cells, like the parental strain W3110 (10Doerrler W.T. Reedy M.C. Raetz C.R.H. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 11461-11464Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (182) Google Scholar). Lipid A from the latter strain migrates just below PE in this system (10Doerrler W.T. Reedy M.C. Raetz C.R.H. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 11461-11464Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (182) Google Scholar). However, the lipid A molecules from the polymyxin-resistant strain WD101 are displayed as a group of slowly migrating bands (Fig. 3E, left arrows 1-4). This pattern is because of the presence of one or two hydrophilic phosphoethanolamine and/or aminoarabinose groups (31Trent M.S. Ribeiro A.A. Lin S. Cotter R.J. Raetz C.R.H. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 43122-43131Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (246) Google Scholar, 32Trent M.S. Ribeiro A.A. Doerrler W.T. Lin S. Cotter R.J. Raetz C.R.H. J. Biol.

Chem. 2001; 276: 43111-43121Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (184) Google Scholar), as explained in the legend. These modified lipid A species are present mainly in the outer membrane when MsbA is functional (Fig. 3E). Fig. 3, D and F show the analysis of the sucrose gradient fractions from the polymyxin-resistant strain WD201, which in addition to pmrAC contains the temperature-sensitive msbA2 mutation. WD201 accumulates newly made phospholipids and lipid A within its inner membrane after a shift to 44 °C (Fig. 3, D and F), similar to what is seen in the polymyxin-sensitive parental strain WD2 (10Doerrler W.T. Reedy M.C. Raetz C.R.H. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 11461-11464Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (182) Google Scholar). However, the lipid A that accumulates in the inner membrane of WD201 is largely unmodified, as judged by its migration just below PE (Fig. 3F, right arrow). These data indicate that following the inactivation of MsbA newly made lipid A does not gain access to ArnT and EptA/PmrC (Fig. 2), supporting the view that MsbA plays a critical role in the trans-bilayer movement of lipid A. Hydroxylation of Newly Made Lipid A by LpxO Is MsbA-independent—To make certain that newly synthesized lipid A is not sequestered from all enzymes involved in lipid A modification when msbA is inactivated, we constructed a derivative of WD2 and its parent W3110 expressing the Salmonella lpxO gene (Fig. 2), an inner membrane hydroxylase that can function only when the biosynthesis of hexa-acylated lipid A is completed (35Gibbons H.S. Lin S. Cotter R.J. Raetz C.R.H. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 32940-32949Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar). The active site of LpxO must face the cytoplasm given that it utilizes several cytoplasmic substrates (Fig. 2). Inactivation of the MsbA mutant protein in WD2/pHSG1 did not interfere with lipid A hydroxylation when compared with W3110/pHSG1 (Fig. 4), consistent with the unrestricted accessibility of newly made lipid A to LpxO on the inner surface of the inner membrane under conditions that block lipid export and lipid A modification with phosphoethanolamine or aminoarabinose (Fig. 4). As an additional control the concurrent formation of the lipid A diphosphate variant (Fig. 4A), which was previously shown to be MsbA-dependent (17Zhou Z. White K.A. Polissi A. Georgopoulos C.

In human subjects, overexpression of annexin 2 in acute promyelocytic leukemia leads to a bleeding diathesis reflective of excessive cell surface annexin 2-dependent generation of plasmin (Menell, J. S., Cesarman, G. M., Jacovina, A. T., McLaughlin, M. A., Lev, E. A., and Hajjar, K. A. (1999) N. Engl. J. Med. 340, 994–1004). In addition, mice completely deficient in annexin 2 display fibrin accumulation within blood vessels and impaired clearance of injury-induced thrombi (Ling Q., Jacovina, A.T., Deora, A.B., Febbraio, M., Simantov, R., Silverstein, R. L., Hempstead, B. L., Mark, W., and Hajjar, K. A. (2004) J. Clin. Investig. 113, 38–48). Here, we show that endothelial cell annexin 2, a protein that lacks a typical signal peptide, translocates from the cytoplasm to the extracytoplasmic plasma membrane in response to brief temperature stress both in vitro and in vivo in the absence of cell death or cell lysis. This regulated response is independent of new protein or mRNA synthesis and does not require the classical endoplasmic reticulum-Golgi pathway. Temperature stress-induced annexin 2 translocation is dependent on both expression of protein p11 (S100A10) and tyrosine phosphorylation of annexin 2 because annexin 2 release is completely eliminated on depletion of p11, inactivation of tyrosine kinase, or mutation of tyrosine 23. Translocation of annexin 2 to the cell surface dramatically increases tissue plasminogen activator-dependent plasminogen activation potential and may represent a novel stress-induced protein secretion pathway.

Translocation of annexin 2 to the cell surface dramatically increases tissue plasminogen activator-dependent plasminogen activation potential and may represent a novel stress-induced protein secretion pathway. The annexins represent a >50-member family of calcium-dependent, phospholipid-binding proteins of largely unknown function (1Gerke V. Moss S.E. Physiol. Rev. 2002; 82: 331-371Crossref PubMed Scopus (1596) Google Scholar). The canonical annexin “fold” (G-X-G-T-(38)-D/E) allows these proteins to shuttle intracellularly between aqueous and membrane compartments in response to fluctuations in calcium concentration. Like most family members, annexin 2 consists of a variable, Mr ∼3,000 amino-terminal “tail” domain and a conserved, Mr ∼33,000 carboxyl-terminal “core” region. The core specifies membrane binding capability, whereas the tail possesses an invariant tyrosine 23, the pp60-c-src phosphorylation target (2Isacke C.M. Trowbridge I.S. Hunter T. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1986; 6: 2745-2751Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). The annexin 2 tail also mediates heterotetramer formation with the S100 protein p11 (S100A10) that enhances membrane phospholipid binding affinity (3Thiel C. Osborn M. Gerke V. J. Cell Sci. 1992; 103: 733-742Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Annexin 2 was originally discovered as a cellular substrate for the avian sarcoma virus-transforming gene product, pp60-src (4Erikson E. Erikson R.L. Cell. 1980; 21: 829-836Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (213) Google Scholar). Recent evidence indicates that annexin 2 is a constitutive regulator of the fibrinolytic system. Annexin 2 serves as a co-receptor for the plasma-derived fibrinolytic zymogen, plasminogen, and its endothelial cell-derived activator, tissue plasminogen activator (tPA) 1The abbreviations used are: tPA, tissue plasminogen activator; FGF, fibroblast growth factor; HUVEC, human umbilical vein endothelial cell; RFU, relative fluorescence unit(s); siRNA, small interfering RNA; GFP, green fluorescent protein.1The abbreviations used are: tPA, tissue plasminogen activator; FGF, fibroblast growth factor; HUVEC, human umbilical vein endothelial cell; RFU, relative fluorescence unit(s); siRNA, small interfering RNA; GFP, green fluorescent protein.

Chem. 1991; 266: 21962-21970Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Both ligands assemble at distinct domains under equilibrium conditions and with high affinity, forming a catalytic complex that augments the efficiency (Km/kcat) of plasmin generation by 60-fold (7Cesarman G.M. Guevara C.A. Hajjar K.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 21198-21203Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Annexin 2 binding sites for plasminogen and tPA are blocked by interaction with two recognized atherothrombotic agents, lipoprotein(a) and homocysteine, respectively, providing a mechanistic basis for occlusive vascular disease in disease states associated with hyperlipoproteinemia(a) or hyperhomocysteinemia (8Hajjar K.A.

In rats, furthermore, pretreatment of the carotid artery with wild-type annexin 2, but not a mutant form of the protein, prevents vessel thrombosis in response to oxidative injury with ferric chloride (10Ishii H. Yoshida M. Hiraoka M. Hajjar K.A. Tanaka A. Yasukochi Y. Numano F. Circ. Res. 2001; 89: 1240-1245Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). In human subjects, overexpression of annexin 2 in acute promyelocytic leukemia leads to a hyperfibrinolytic bleeding diathesis reflective of excessive cell surface annexin 2-dependent generation of plasmin (11Menell J.S.

In addition, mice completely deficient in annexin 2 display fibrin accumulation within blood vessels and impaired clearance of injury-induced thrombi (12Ling Q. Jacovina A.T. Deora A.B. Febbraio M.

Thus, regulated endothelial cell surface expression of annexin 2 may represent a crucial cellular defense mechanism against intravascular thrombosis following vascular injury or stress. Despite evidence for the central role of annexin 2 in fibrinolysis, the mechanisms that control annexin 2 cell surface expression have not been delineated. Recent evidence indicates that members of the annexin family can be released into the extracellular environment even though they lack the hydrophobic signal sequence typical of classically secreted proteins. Annexin 1 is actively secreted into human seminal plasma (13Christmas P. Callaway J. Fallon J. Jones J. Haigler H.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 2499-2507Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), and annexin 6 translocates from an intracellular pool to the external basolateral surface of mouse mammary duct epithelium upon onset of lactation (14Rocha V. Lozano J.J. Haindl A.H. Biochem. Soc. Trans. 1990; 18: 1110-1113Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar). Evidence that annexin 2 is similarly expressed on cell surfaces includes the following observations: anti-annexin 2 IgG specifically inhibits binding of plasminogen and tPA to endothelial cells (5Hajjar K.A. Jacovina A.T. Chacko J. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 21191-21197Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), annexin 2-transfected human embryonic kidney HEK293 cells acquire the ability to bind both ligands (5Hajjar K.A. Jacovina A.T. Chacko J. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 21191-21197Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), annexin 2 can be eluted from the cell surface by the calcium-chelating agent EGTA (6Hajjar K.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 21962-21970Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), and flow cytometric analysis of fixed nonpermeabilized endothelial, monocytoid, and promyelocytic cells reveals annexin 2 cross-reactive material on the cell surface (5Hajjar K.A.

Nevertheless, the mechanism for extracellular transport of annexin 2 and related polypeptides is unknown. In the present study, we used a temperature-induced model of cellular stress to examine the stimulated translocation of annexin 2 to the cell surface. Our data show that annexin 2 translocation occurs independently of the classical endoplasmic reticulum-Golgi pathway and does not involve de novo protein synthesis. In contrast, translocation requires the presence of the annexin 2 binding partner p11 (S100A10) and the phosphorylation of annexin 2 at Tyr23 through a Src-like tyrosine kinase-dependent mechanism both in vitro and in vivo. Using both biochemical and quantitative cell biological approaches, we found that brief temperature stress was associated with a doubling or tripling of annexin 2 expression at the cell surface, an increase that would have profound implications for hemostatic balance in humans (11Menell J.S. Cesarman G.M. Jacovina A.T. McLaughlin M.A. Lev E.A. Hajjar K.A. N. Engl. J. Med. 1999; 340: 994-1004Crossref PubMed Scopus (315) Google Scholar). Cell Culture and Temperature Stress—Human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs; 80–90% confluent) were isolated and propagated as described previously (5Hajjar K.A. Jacovina A.T. Chacko J. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 21191-21197Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and studied at passage 1–4. For temperature stress, confluent cells were washed twice with HEPES buffered saline (pH 7.4) and incubated in serum-containing medium at 42 °C (heat stress) or 37 °C (control) in a 5% CO2 humidified incubator (3 h). Endothelial cell viability after heat stress was verified by trypan blue exclusion and by lactate dehydrogenase release as described previously (16Hajjar K.A. Guevara C.A. Lev E. Dowling K. Chacko J. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 21652-21659Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar). Inhibitors (cycloheximide, brefeldin A, okadaic acid, sodium orthovanadate, genistein, PP3, PP2, and herbimycin A) were used in each experiment at concentrations that did not produce cytotoxicity as assessed by trypan blue exclusion. Microinjection and Quantification of Annexin 2-GFP at the Cell Surface—The full-length human annexin 2 cDNA was cloned in-frame with a carboxyl-terminal GFP coding sequence into the eukaryotic expression vector pEGFP-N3 (Clontech) utilizing unique XhoI and KpnI restriction sites. To ascertain the expression of the full-length annexin 2-GFP protein, transient transfection (SuperFect reagent; Qiagen) of transformed HEK293 human embryonic kidney cells was carried out using the above-mentioned cDNA, followed by immunoblot analysis. HUVECs were plated on sterile glass coverslips coated with fibronectin (7 μg ml–1; PBS) and allowed to adhere for 6–8 h. Annexin 2-GFP cDNA stock was prepared in water and subsequently diluted in HKCl microinjection buffer (10 mm HEPES, 140 mm KCl, pH 7.4) to a final concentration of 10 μg ml–1. Annexin 2-GFP cDNA was introduced into cell nuclei by pressure microinjection using back-loaded glass capillaries and a Narishige micromanipulator (Narishige, Greenvale, NY) (17Kreitzer G. Schmoranzer J. Low S.H. Li X. Gan Y. Weimbs T. Simon S.M. Rodriguez-Boulan E. Nat. Cell Biol. 2003; 5: 126-136Crossref PubMed Scopus (182) Google Scholar). Cells were maintained at 37 °C in a humidified, 5% CO2 environment for 60 min after microinjection to allow expression of the exogenous cDNA and then either maintained at 37 °C (control) or transferred to 42 °C (heat stress) in a humidified incubator for 3 h. Cells were rinsed in PBS and fixed in 2% paraformaldehyde (21 °C, 2 min). Annexin 2-GFP at the cell surface was immunolabeled with rabbit anti-GFP IgG (7.5 μg ml–1; Novus Biologicals, Littleton, CO), followed by Cy3-conjugated donkey anti-rabbit IgG secondary antibody (1:200 dilution; Jackson Immunoresearch). Images of injected cells expressing annexin 2-GFP were acquired using a Nikon E-600 microscope coupled to a back-illuminated, cooled charge-coupled device camera (CCD1000-PB; Princeton Instruments/Roper Scientific) and transferred to a computer work station running MetaMorph imaging software (Universal Imaging Corp/Molecular Devices). Images were collected using a fluorescein filter (B-2E/C DM 505; Nikon) for direct detection of annexin 2-GFP and a rhodamine filter (G-2E/C DM 565; Nikon) for indirect immunofluorescence detection of cell surface-associated annexin 2-GFP. Images of annexin 2-GFP and anti-GFP labeling were acquired using identical acquisition settings and exposure times for all samples in a single experiment. The integrated cellular fluorescence intensities of total annexin 2-GFP and surface-associated anti-GFP were measured, and the ratio of anti-GFP/annexin 2-GFP intensities was calculated for each group of injected cells. Cell Surface Biotinylation—HUVECs (8 × 105) were washed twice with ice-cold PBS (pH 7.4) containing 1 mm CaCl2 and1mm MgCl2, and cell surface biotinylated proteins were precipitated from equal amounts of lysate (300–400 μg) and analyzed as described previously (18Marmorstein A.D. Zurzolo C. Le Bivic A. Rodriguez-Boulan E. Celis J. Cell Biology: A Laboratory Handbook. 4. Academic Press, New York1998: 341-350Google Scholar). Immunoreactive proteins resolved on 17.5% or 12.5% SDS-polyacrylamide gels were transferred to nitrocellulose (Bio-Rad), reacted with anti-annexin 2 or anti-p11 monoclonal IgG followed by horseradish peroxidase-conjugated ovine anti-mouse IgG, and visualized using chemiluminescence (ECL; Amersham Biosciences). Blots were scanned, digitized (Adobe Photoshop version 4.0.1), and analyzed densitometrically (SigmaGel version 1.0; Jandel or Scion Image, beta 3 version, Scion Corp.). Immunoprecipitation and Immunoblot Analysis—Confluent endothelial cells (5 × 106 per 100-mm culture dish) were washed with PBS (4 °C) and lysed (20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 3% Triton X-100, 50 mmn-octyl β-d-glucopyranoside, 150 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 2.5 mm sodium pyrophosphate, 1 mm β-glycerolphosphate, 1 mm sodium orthovanadate, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 10 μg ml–1 leupeptin; 5 min; 4 °C). Lysates were sonicated eight times (5 s each, 4 °C) and incubated (4 °C, 30 min). Supernatants (14,000 × g, 15 min, 4 °C, 1 mg) were incubated with immobilized anti-phosphotyrosine monoclonal IgG (P-Tyr-100; Cell Signaling Technology) (25 μl, 4 °C, 14 h). Pellets (12,000 × g, 30 s, 4 °C) were washed five times in a buffer containing 20 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 1% Triton X-100, 150 mm NaCl, 2.5 mm sodium pyrophosphate, 1 mm β-glycerolphosphate, 1 mm sodium orthovanadate, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and 10 μg ml–1 leupeptin. Bound proteins were resolved on 10% SDS-polyacrylamide gels and blotted with anti-annexin 2 IgG (0.25 μg ml–1 each; Transduction Laboratories and Zymed Laboratories) (2 h, 37 °C). Plasmin Generation Assays—Rates of plasminogen activation were assessed after incubation of cells with amino-terminal glutamic acid plasminogen (100 nm, 1 h, 4 °C) and tPA (10 nm) premixed with the fluorogenic plasmin substrate d-Val-Leu-Lys-7-amino-4-trifluoromethyl coumarin (AFC-81; Enzyme Systems) (125 μm, 200 μl) (19Jacovina A.T. Zhong F. Khazanova E. Lev E. Deora A.B. Hajjar K.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 49350-49358Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). Substrate hydrolysis was estimated in duplicate at 4-min intervals in a fluorescence spectrophotometer (SpectraMAX Gemini XS; Molecular Devices) as relative fluorescence units (RFU) at excitation 400 nm and emission 505 nm. Initial rates of plasmin generation were calculated for triplicate experiments using linear regression analysis of plots of RFU versus min2 (RFU min–2). In the absence of tPA, no significant plasmin generation was observed. Stable Transfections—Together with a carboxyl-terminal tag containing the c-Myc epitope, the full-length human annexin 2 cDNA was cloned in-frame into the eukaryotic expression vector pcDNA3.1/Myc-His (Invitrogen) utilizing unique XhoI and KpnI restriction sites. The resulting wild-type vector was subsequently modified by site-directed mutagenesis (QuikChange; Stratagene), substituting the tyrosine (codon TAT) at position 23 with an alanine (codon GCT) resulting in the Y23A mutant. The integrity of both vectors was verified by full-length cDNA sequence analysis. Transformed human embryonic kidney cells (HEK293) were transfected with either wild-type or Y23A annexin 2 mutant cDNA using Superfect reagent (Qiagen). Stable clones were selected and maintained in the presence of G418 (600 μg ml–1; Invitrogen). Total cell lysates for immunoblot and immunoprecipitation analysis from these cells were prepared using the protocol mentioned for HUVECs. Anti-myc IgG (Cell Signaling Technology) was used to detect the expression of myc-tagged annexin 2, whereas anti-phosphotyrosine (PY 20; Transduction Laboratories) was used to detect phosphotyrosylated annexin 2. p11 Silencing—Two annealed 64-bp oligonucleotides, each containing 19-nucleotide reverse complement sequences homologous to a portion of the mouse p11 gene (141GGATCCTCTGGCTGTGGAC159), separated by a 9-nucleotide spacer sequence, were subcloned into the BglII and HindIII sites of the 3.2-kb plasmid pSUPER (Oligoengine) containing the H1-RNA promoter (20Brummelkamp T.R. Bernards R. Agami R. Science. 2002; 296: 550-553Crossref PubMed Scopus (3928) Google Scholar). A neomycin resistance cDNA cassette was introduced between unique XhoI and KpnI sites, downstream of the HindIII site. The empty pSUPER vector containing the neomycin resistance cassette served as a control. A transformed mouse endothelial cell line (a kind gift of Dr. B. Weksler; Weill Medical College of Cornell University) was transfected with the above-mentioned vectors using Superfect reagent (Qiagen), and single cell clones were selected, expanded, and propagated in the presence of G418 (400 μg ml–1; Invitrogen). Total RNA was extracted by using TRIzol reagent (Invitrogen). 1 μg of total RNA was reverse transcribed using One-Step reverse transcription-PCR kit (Qiagen) according to the manufacturer's protocol for 22 cycles using mouse p11, annexin 2, and glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase gene-specific primers, and the products were analyzed by agarose gel electrophoresis. In Vivo Temperature Stress—Mice (C57Bl/6, 4–8 weeks old) received intraperitoneal injection with either 0.2% Me2SO or herbimycin A in Me2SO (200 μg kg–1) 2 h before placement in a 2-cm-deep, constant temperature water bath (40.8 °C ± 0.2 °C) or maintenance at room temperature (24 °C) for 45 min (21Huang L. Mivechi N.F. Moskophidis D. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 21: 8575-8591Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar). After temperature stress, mice were anesthetized by inhalation of methoxyfluorane until tail and toe pinch reflexes were extinguished. After thoracotomy, the right atrial appendage was incised, and the animal was perfused via the left ventricle using a constant infusion pump. The perfusate consisted of 10 ml of ice-cold PBS (2 ml min–1), followed by cell-impermeable sulfo-NHS-SS-biotin (1 mg ml–1 in PBS, 1 ml min–1, 5 ml). Excess biotin was then quenched by infusion of 50 mm NH4Cl, followed by ice-cold PBS (1 ml min–1; 5 ml, total volume). The thoracic aorta was harvested, washed twice with ice-cold PBS, and homogenized in 20 mm Tris-HCl, 150 mm NaCl, 5 mm EDTA, pH 8.0, containing 1% Triton X-100, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1 mm sodium orthovanadate, 10 μg ml–1 leupeptin, and 10 μg ml–1 aprotinin (Dounce, Teflon pestle, 10–12 strokes) before extraction in the same buffer (4 °C, 1 h). Cell surface biotinylated proteins were streptavidin (agarose-conjugated)-precipitated from equal protein concentrations of homogenate and analyzed by immunoblot with anti-annexin 2 IgG. Heat Stress Stimulates Translocation of Annexin 2 to the Surface of Cultured Endothelial Cells in Vitro—To study regulation of cell surface annexin 2 expression in the human endothelial cell, we used a 3-h period of mild temperature stimulation designed to induce a typical heat stress response. To determine the effect of this maneuver on cell viability, we utilized the trypan blue exclusion assay, which revealed no significant difference between cells incubated at either 37 °Cor 42 °C. Terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase-mediated dUTP nick end labeling assay for apoptosis revealed less than 0.0003% immunofluorescence among cells maintained at either 37 °C or 42 °C, whereas 20–30% of terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase-treated positive controls showed strong immunofluorescence. Similarly, neither release of the cytoplasmic enzyme lactate dehydrogenase (9.0 ± 2.4 versus 5.9 ± 3.2 units ml–1, S.E.; n = 3) nor release of 51Cr from preloaded cells (2.5 ± 0.3% versus 0.5 ± 0.4%, S.E.; n = 3) was increased in cells treated at 42 °C versus those maintained at 37 °C. These data indicated that heat stress failed to induce cell death or cell lysis. We have previously utilized cell surface elution with the calcium-chelating agent EGTA to dissociate annexin 2 from the endothelial cell surface (16Hajjar K.A. Guevara C.A. Lev E. Dowling K. Chacko J. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 21652-21659Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar). Whereas annexin 2 levels in cell lysates remained invariant during temperature stress, levels in surface EGTA eluates increased significantly over those in 37 °C controls (Fig. 1A). Similarly, among cell surface proteins derivatized with a cell-impermeable biotin analog and precipitated with immobilized streptavidin, temperature stress induced a 2.2 ± 0.2-fold (mean ± S.E.; n = 5) increase in cell surface expression of both annexin 2 and p11 in 42 °C samples over 37 °C controls (Fig. 1B). Because increased temperature did not induce any change in the recovery of control fluid-phase annexin 2 by biotin-streptavidin precipitation and we saw no difference in detection of another membrane protein, thrombomodulin, we concluded that heat stimulation leads to increased biomass of annexin 2 at the cell surface. Increased expression of annexin 2 at the cell surface was accompanied by a concomitant increase in cell surface fibrinolytic potential. Temperature stress induced a 2.3 ± 0.2-fold (mean ± S.E.; n = 6) increase in tPA-dependent plasmin generation compared with cells maintained at 37 °C (Fig. 1C). Whereas preimmune IgG had no effect on the rate of plasminogen activation, the heat-induced increase in plasmin production was completely inhibited in the presence of anti-annexin 2 IgG, and baseline plasminogen activation at 37 °C was reduced by 61.6 ± 3.6% (mean ± S.E.; n = 3). Preimmune IgG, on the other hand, had no effect on this activity. These data indicated that translocated annexin 2 was fibrinolytically active and that all of the heat-induced increment in fibrinolytic potential could be attributed to increased annexin 2 expression. To better understand the origin of stress-induced cell surface annexin 2, we used human annexin 2 (∼37 kDa) tagged with GFP (∼25 kDa) at the carboxyl terminus. HEK293 cells transfected with the annexin 2-GFP fusion construct expressed a protein of the predicted apparent molecular mass (∼62 kDa) that cross-reacted with antibodies directed against both annexin 2 and GFP (Fig. 2A). When we examined the effect of heat stress, we observed increased expression of a 62-kDa, anti-GFP-immunoreactive cell surface protein that was increased on cells incubated at 42 °C as compared with those incubated at 37 °C (Fig. 2B). To ascertain whether annexin 2 translocated from an intracellular location to the outer leaflet of the plasma membrane of individual cells exposed to temperature stress, we expressed GFP-tagged annexin 2 by nuclear injection of cDNAs in human endothelial cells. After a 37 °C incubation (60 min), newly synthesized annexin 2-GFP protein was uniformly distributed throughout the cytoplasm of the injected cells. In cells subsequently incubated at 42 °C or 37 °C, we detected surface-associated annexin 2-GFP protein on paraformaldehyde-fixed cells, using anti-GFP IgG in an indirect immunofluorescence assay. Total GFP-annexin 2 was detected at a separate wavelength via its intrinsic fluorescence. Cell surface annexin 2-GFP-related immunofluorescence was markedly increased in cells subjected to heat stress as compared with cells maintained at 37 °C (Fig. 2C). In addition, when the ratio of cell surface GFP to total annexin 2-GFP was analyzed in three independent experiments, we found that 3.4% of control cells (2 of 59) versus 38% of heat-stressed cells (22 of 58) exhibited at least a doubling in the surface/total annexin 2-GFP ratio over the 3-h incubation period (Fig. 2D). Cell Surface Translocation of Annexin 2 Is Protein Synthesis- and Endoplasmic Reticulum-Golgi-independent—The temperature-induced increase in cell surface annexin 2 expression was enhanced rather than impaired by blockade of protein synthesis (Fig. 3). Cycloheximide treatment, at a dose that inhibited 80% of total protein synthesis, potentiated rather than inhibited annexin 2 translocation in both 37 °C- and 42 °C-treated cells. Furthermore, Northern blot analysis showed no change in steady-state mRNA levels during heat stress (data not shown). In addition, we tested whether an intact endoplasmic reticulum-Golgi-related pathway might be required for annexin 2 release. Temperature-stressed cells treated with brefeldin A, an agent that disrupts the endoplasmic reticulum-Golgi complex, showed no decrease in their ability to direct annexin 2 to the cell surface, even though 73% of total protein secretion was blocked (data not shown). In addition, in microinjected cells, we never detected annexin 2-GFP in a pattern consistent with distribution within the endoplasmic reticulum or Golgi (data not shown). These data suggest that temperature stress induces translocation of annexin 2 from the cytoplasm to the cell surface in a protein synthesis-independent and endoplasmic reticulum-Golgi-independent manner. Cell Surface Translocation of Annexin 2 Requires p11 Expression—p11, a member of the S100 family of calcium-binding proteins, is an annexin 2 ligand that forms a heterotetramer with two annexin 2 monomer subunits in response to changes in intracellular calcium concentration (3Thiel C. Osborn M. Gerke V. J. Cell Sci. 1992; 103: 733-742Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). On complex formation with annexin 2 monomer, p11 enhances the phospholipid binding affinity of annexin 2 by directing it to anionic phospholipids on the inner leaflet of the plasma membrane. To study the contribution of p11 to annexin 2 translocation, we stably suppressed p11 protein expression in a transformed mouse endothelial cell line by RNA interference (20Brummelkamp T.R. Bernards R. Agami R. Science. 2002; 296: 550-553Crossref PubMed Scopus (3928) Google Scholar) (Fig. 4). We analyzed the effect of small interfering RNA (siRNA) on the p11 mRNA levels by performing reverse transcription-PCR. p11 mRNA levels were found to be reduced by ∼84% in pSUPER/p11siRNA cells as compared with the pSUPER cells or the untransfected parental cells. Furthermore, the annexin 2 and glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase mRNA levels remained unchanged, indicating that the siRNA approach was specific and that reduction of p11 mRNA levels did not affect the mRNA levels of annexin 2 (Fig. 4A). In this system, cells stably transfected with the p11 RNA silencing vector (siRNA) showed persistent, ∼90% suppression of p11 protein expression, whereas annexin 2 protein expression was unchanged (Fig. 4B). In cells transfected with the empty vector, cell surface annexin 2 as well as p11 increased by 2.4-fold in response to temperature stimulation, whereas surface expression of annexin 2 and p11 was markedly reduced at both 37 °C and 42 °C in cells expressing p11 siRNA (Fig."
https://openalex.org/W2117100349,"Wnt and estrogen signaling represent important regulatory pathways, each controlling a wide range of biological processes. While an increasing number of observations suggest potential convergence between these pathways, no direct evidence of their functional interaction has been reported. Using human colon and breast cancer cells, we found that estrogen receptor (ER) α- and β-catenin precipitated within the same immunocomplexes, reciprocally enhanced the transactivation of cognate reporter genes, and were reciprocally recruited to cognate response elements in the promoters of endogenous target genes. Using transgenic Drosophila that ectopically expressed human ERα alone or together with metabolically stable β-catenin/Armadillo mutants, we demonstrated genetic interaction between these signal transducers in vivo. Thus, we present here the first direct evidence of cross-talk between Wnt and estrogen signaling pathways via functional interaction between β-catenin and ERα.

Estrogens regulate a plethora of physiological functions in the developing and adult organism and act predominantly via the activation of ERα 1The abbreviations used are: ER, estrogen receptor; ERE, estrogen response element; TCF, T cell factor; LEF, lymphoid enhancer factor; TBE, TCF/LEF binding element; CSFCS, charcoal-stripped fetal calf serum; ChIP, chromatin immunoprecipitation; TUNEL, terminal deoxynucleotidyltransferase-mediated dUTP nick end labeling; LBD, ligand binding domain; wt, wild-type. 1The abbreviations used are: ER, estrogen receptor; ERE, estrogen response element; TCF, T cell factor; LEF, lymphoid enhancer factor; TBE, TCF/LEF binding element; CSFCS, charcoal-stripped fetal calf serum; ChIP, chromatin immunoprecipitation; TUNEL, terminal deoxynucleotidyltransferase-mediated dUTP nick end labeling; LBD, ligand binding domain; wt, wild-type. and ERβ. Liganded ER dimers bind to promoter estrogen response elements (EREs) and regulate the transcription of target genes. This ER-mediated regulation requires the recruitment of different co-factor complexes and is associated with rearrangement of chromatin structure at EREs within target gene promoters (1Yanagisawa J. Kitagawa H. Yanagida M. Wada O. Ogawa S. Nakagomi M. Oishi H. Yamamoto Y. Nagasawa H. McMahon S.B. Cole M.D. Tora L. Takahashi N. Kato S. Mol.

ER can also act as a co-factor at non-ERE sites via interaction with other DNA-bound transcriptional factor complexes, such as c-Jun/c-Fos on the AP-1 site (3Kushner P.J. Agard D.A. Greene G.L. Scanlan T.S. Shiau A.K. Uht R.M. Webb P. J. Steroid Biochem. Mol. Biol. 2000; 74: 311-317Crossref PubMed Scopus (735) Google Scholar) or c-Jun/NFκB on the tumor necrosis factor response element (4Tzagarakis-Foster C. Geleziunas R. Lomri A. An J. Dale C Leitman D.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 44772-44777Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). The physiological significance of ERs is demonstrated by the severe abnormalities in development and function of major organs and tissues in mice with ablated ERα and/or ERβ (5Couse J.F. Korach K.S. Endocr. Rev. 1999; 20: 358-417Crossref PubMed Scopus (0) Google Scholar). Also, both positive and negative impacts of estrogens in different types of cancer have been well documented (6Creasman W.T. Gynecol. Oncol. 2002; 86: 1-9Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). Wnt signaling plays a critical role in numerous processes of development and in adult tissues and appears to be conserved across all animal taxa. β-Catenin is an intracellular transducer of canonical Wnt or Wnt/β-catenin signaling and, thus, has a dual function: as a transcriptional factor and, in a cadherin-bound form, as a regulator of cell adhesion and migration. Cytoplasmic or signaling β-catenin is unstable and rapidly targeted to phosphorylation-ubiquitination-coupled proteasomal degradation. Wnt signaling inhibits this degradation, resulting in the accumulation of β-catenin in the nucleus and its association with members of the T cell factor/lymphoid enhancer factor (TCF/LEF) family of transcriptional factors that leads to the activation of Wnt target genes. Mutations that increase the stability of cytoplasmic β-catenin have been implicated in numerous malignant transformations and represent a leading cause of colorectal tumorigenesis (7Akiyama T. Cytokine Growth Factor Rev. 2000; 11: 273-282Crossref PubMed Scopus (277) Google Scholar, 8Peifer M. Polakis P. Science. 2000; 287: 1606-1609Crossref PubMed Scopus (1140) Google Scholar, 9Bienz M. Clevers H. Nat. Cell Biol. 2003; 5: 179-182Crossref PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar). Consistent with the concept of morphogen gradients (10Tabata T. Nat. Rev. Genet. 2001; 2: 620-630Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar) β-catenin exerts different biological effects, such as induction of cell proliferation and apoptosis or stimulation and repression of the same target genes, in a threshold-dependent manner (11Waltzer L. Vandel L. Bienz M. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 137-145Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar, 12Olmeda D. Castel S. Vilaro S. Cano A. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2003; 14: 2844-2860Crossref PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar). Thus, slight modulation of β-catenin signaling through cross-talk with other pathways may trigger serious physiological consequences. Potential cross-talk between Wnt/β-catenin and estrogen signaling in vivo has been implicated in physiological studies on tissues as different as brain (13Cardona-Gomez P. Perez M. Avila J. Garcia-Segura L.M. Wandosell F. Mol. Cell. Neurosci. 2004; 25: 363-373Crossref PubMed Scopus (170) Google Scholar) and uterus (14Gunin A.G. Emelianov V.U. Mironkin I.U. Morozov M.P. Tolmachev A.S. Eur. J. Obstet. Gynecol. Reprod. Biol. 2004; 114: 83-91Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). Furthermore, although males and females develop colorectal cancer with approximately the same frequency, its incidence rate is significantly lower in women undergoing hormone replacement therapy (15Crandall C.J. J. Womens Health Gend. Based Med. 1999; 8: 1155-1166Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar, 16Nelson H.D. Humphrey L.L. Nygren P. Teutsch S.M. Allan J.D. J. Am. Med. Assoc. 2002; 288: 872-881Crossref PubMed Scopus (901) Google Scholar). While these and other observations suggested the possibility of functional interaction between ER and β-catenin, previous attempts failed to detect such an interaction (13Cardona-Gomez P. Perez M. Avila J. Garcia-Segura L.M. Wandosell F. Mol. Cell. Neurosci. 2004; 25: 363-373Crossref PubMed Scopus (170) Google Scholar, 17Yang F. Yang F. Li X. Sharma M. Sasaki C.Y. Longo D.L. Lim B. Sun Z. J.

Chem. 2002; 277: 20702-20710Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar), and no direct evidence of Wnt and estrogen signaling pathway convergence has been reported. Compared with vertebrates, Wnt signaling has been far better characterized in Drosophila, in which it is not obscured by involvement of other, evolutionary more recent multiple pathways. Thus, Drosophila provides a powerful experimental system for analysis of functional interaction in vivo between Wnt signaling and other regulatory pathways, including those immerged at the later stages of evolution. Therefore, in addition to mammalian cells, to detect functional interaction between Wnt/β-catenin and estrogen signaling in vivo we used transgenic Drosophila that ectopically expressed human ERα coupled to an ERE-dependent green fluorescent protein (GFP) reporter gene alone or together with constitutively active mutants of Armadillo, a Drosophila homologue of β-catenin. Using different approaches, we obtained in this study the first evidence of physical association and transcriptional and genetic interaction in vivo between ERα and β-catenin. Immunoprecipitation and Immunoblotting—Cells grown in the presence of charcoal-stripped fetal calf serum (CSFCS) were transfected with FLAG-hERα expression vector and harvested 28–30 h post-transfection, after treatment for 3 h with vehicle (ethanol) or 10–8m 17β-estradiol (Sigma), tamoxifen (Sigma), or ICI 182,780 (Tocris). Anti-β-catenin E-5 or H-102 antibodies (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) or preimmune rabbit serum IgG (as a negative control) were used for immunoprecipitation. Western blots were visualized with anti-FLAG M2 (Sigma) or anti-ERα HC-20 (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) antibodies. Transfection and Reporter Assay—Cells grown in Opti-MEM, 5% CSFCS were transfected with 250 ng of reporter (ERE-tk-luc or tk-luc for MCF7 cells and TOPFLASH or FOPFLASH for colon cancer cells) and 1 ng of pRl (Promega) plasmid (control for transfection efficiency) together with 100 ng of empty (control) or cDNA (β-catenin S33Y for MCF7 cells and ERα for colon cancer cells) expression vector and treated for 16–20 h with vehicle or 10–8m ligand, as indicated. To nullify nonspecific effects on basal promoters, TOPFLASH and ERE-tk-luc reporter activities were normalized against FOPFLASH and tk-Luc reporter activities, respectively, from parallel experiments. Chromatin Immunoprecipitation (ChIP) Assay—Association of ERα and β-catenin with ERE in the pS2 gene promoter (19Shang Y. Hu X. DiRenzo J. Lazar M.A. Brown M.

As a control for nonspecific chromatin precipitation with these antibodies, a set of primers was used to amplify a pS2 gene DNA segment that does not have ERE or TBE sequences. In addition, IgG from normal preimmune rabbit serum was used as a negative control. Histology and Immunostaining—All techniques were performed as described previously (21Takeyama K. Ito S.

Nat. Cell Biol. 2003; 5: 211-215Crossref PubMed Scopus (179) Google Scholar). Expression of ERα and GFP in Drosophila eye discs were detected using Zeiss Confocal Laser Scanning System 510 and quantified by calculation of pixels of the corresponding signals using Adobe Photoshop 7 software facilities. TUNEL labeling was performed using the TACS2 TdT-Fluor In Situ Apoptosis Detection Kit (Trevigen). Drosophila Lines and Stocks—The UAS-ΔArm and UAS-ArmS10 mutants were obtained from the Bloomington Drosophila Stock Center. Generation and characterization of the used UAS-ERα, ERE-GFP transgenic Drosophila lines were described in Ref. 23Ito S. Takeyama K. Yamamoto A. Sawatsubashi S. Shirode Y. Kouzmenko A. Tabata T. Kato S. Genes Cells. 2004; (DOI 10.1111/j.1365-2443.2004.00777x)Google Scholar. Briefly, cDNA encoding full-length human ERα, ligand binding domain (LBD) deletion mutant ERα-(1–302), or GFP reporter under control an ERE containing promoter were recloned into the pCaSpeR vector. Transgene constructs together with pπ25.7wc transposase were microinjected into w1118 embryos using a micromanipulator (Leica). Several independent transformant lines have been generated. To target ERα expression into the eye disc, transgenic Drosophila were crossed with flies of a GMR-GAL4 line expressing GAL4 driver in the retina under control of the tissue-specific glass multimer gene promoter. Physical Association of ERα and β-Catenin—Human colon cancer HCT116 cells express metabolically stable β-catenin due to mutation at its putative phosphorylation site. These cells, however, do not express detectable ER. HCT116 cells were transfected with a FLAG-tagged human ERα expression plasmid, and endogenous β-catenin was immunoprecipitated from cell lysates following 3-h preincubation with estrogen or vehicle. IgG from normal rabbit serum was used as a control for nonspecific immunoprecipitation. Obtained immunocomplexes were subjected to Western blotting and analyzed by immunostaining with antibodies against FLAG-tag and ERα. ERα co-immunoprecipitated with β-catenin even in the absence of ligand; however, ERα-β-catenin association was markedly stimulated by estrogen (Fig. 1A). Similar results (data not shown) were obtained using SW480 human colon cancer cells, in which non-mutant β-catenin was stabilized by a loss-of-function mutation in the gene of tumor suppressor Adenomatous polyposis coli, an essential component of the β-catenin degradation machinery. Brief exposure to ligand did not affect FLAG-ERα expression in this (Fig. 1A) or further experiments. As anti-β-catenin antibodies co-precipitated a C-terminally truncated FLAG-ERα-(1–396) (Fig. 1B), it appeared that an intact LBD was not essential for the ER interaction with β-catenin. Predictably, C-terminal truncation of ERα abolished the ligand sensitivity of the interaction. We then analyzed whether ligands that inhibited the transcriptional activity of ERα would also affect its interaction with β-catenin. Immunoprecipitation of ERα with antibodies against β-catenin was significantly stimulated by the ERα partial, tamoxifen, and complete, ICI 182,780, antagonists (Fig. 1C). Transcriptional Interaction between ERα and β-Catenin— Next, we investigated whether the apparent physical association between ERα and β-catenin was consequential for transcriptional function of the proteins. Transactivation of an ERE-dependent reporter by endogenous ER was studied in human breast cancer MCF7 cells, in which the Wnt pathway is practically silent. Expression of stabilized β-catenin S33Y in these cells enhanced ligand-dependent expression of the reporter without affecting its basal activity in the absence of ligand (Fig. 2A). Expression of ERα in human colon cancer SW480 (Fig. 2B) and HCT116 (data not shown) cells enhanced the activation of the Wnt-responsive TOPFLASH reporter by endogenous β-catenin in the absence of ligand. Treatment with estrogen resulted in further moderate activation of reporter expression, while ER antagonists appeared not to affect reporter gene activity (Fig. 2B). The reciprocal activation of cognate reporters in the transfection experiments suggested that ERα and β-catenin might reciprocally recruit each other to their corresponding response elements in endogenous target gene promoters. Indeed, antibody against β-catenin precipitated ERE of the pS2 gene promoter from chromatin of β-catenin S33Y expressing MCF7 cells in an estrogen-dependent manner (Fig. 2C). Conversely, anti-ERα antibody precipitated in a ligand-dependent manner Axin2 gene promoter putative TBE from chromatin of SW480 cells transfected with an ERα expression construct, while recruitment of β-catenin to the TBE was not sensitive to the presence of estrogen (Fig. 2D). The used antibodies did not display nonspecific chromatin precipitation (Fig. 2E). Consistent with the results obtained using MCF7 cells, ERα transactivation was markedly enhanced in vivo by the stabilized Armadillo mutants ΔArm (24Tolwinski N.S. Wieschaus E. Development (Camb.). 2001; 128: 2107-2117PubMed Google Scholar) (Fig. 2F) or ArmS10 (25Pai L.M. Orsulic S. Bejsovec A. Peifer M. Development (Camb.). 1997; 124: 2255-2266PubMed Google Scholar) (data not shown) when ectopically co-expressed in the Drosophila eye disc. Genetic Interaction between ERα and β-Catenin—Constitutive activation of Armadillo in the Drosophila eye disc has been shown to induce apoptosis and consequent degeneration in the adult eye (26Greaves S. Sanson B. White P. Vincent J.P. Genetics. 1999; 153: 1753-1766PubMed Google Scholar, 27Freeman M. Bienz M. EMBO Rep. 2001; 2: 157-162Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). Potentiation of β-catenin transcriptional activity by ERα in SW480 cells (Fig. 2B) and functional interaction between ERα and Armadillo (Fig. 2F) would predict activation of endogenous Armadillo by the ectopic ERα expression in the Drosophila eye disc leading to development of a phenotype characteristic of abnormal Wnt/β-catenin activation. We performed TUNEL staining of the third instar larval eye discs with ectopic expression of ERα alone or together with the constitutively active Armadillo mutant ΔArm. When expressed singly, ERα and ΔArm both induced a slight increase in apoptosis compared with wild-type (wt) eye discs from Drosophila of the parental line. Co-expression of ERα and ΔArm resulted in a marked increase in apoptotic cell number. Importantly, while estrogen had no discernible effect on apoptosis in wt eye discs and those expressing either ERα or ΔArm alone (data not shown), treatment with estradiol significantly increased apoptosis rates when ERα and ΔArm (ERα,ΔArm+E2) were coexpressed (Fig. 3A). Activated Armadillo has a mild apoptotic effect in the third instar larva eye disc, reportedly due to the protective counteraction at this stage by the EGFR/MAPK signaling (27Freeman M. Bienz M. EMBO Rep. 2001; 2: 157-162Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). This allowed us to detect differences in apoptosis patterns in transgenic fly eye discs at this developmental stage that would otherwise be difficult to distinguish due to the onset of massive cell death at the later stages. We compared adult eye phenotypes of flies from these transgenic lines and the wt (Fig. 3B). The normal Drosophila eye is composed by regularly spaced ommatidia with regularly oriented interommatidial bristles. Expression of ERα in the eye disc leads to development of phenotypes similar to those caused by expression of ΔArm: rough eye appearance and disorientation or loss of interommatidial bristles. Co-expression of ΔArm and ERα synergistically enhanced this abnormal eye development. Again, while estradiol appeared not to affect the separate ΔArm or ERα expression phenotypes (data not shown), treatment with estrogen, however, further aggravated the severity of eye abnormalities in the ERα and ΔArm co-expression mutants (ERα,ΔArm+E2). Consistent with β-catenin-ERα-(1–396) coimmunoprecipitation, ectopic expression of the LBD deletion mutant ERα-(1–302) in the eye disc produced a phenotype closely resembling that with the full-length ERα (data not shown). We found that β-catenin associated with ERα even in the absence of ligand and that estrogens further enhanced this interaction. While it is possible that the ligand-independent association was due, at least in part, to the overexpression of one of the interacting proteins, the association between β-catenin and C-terminally truncated ERα suggested that the ligand binding was not essential but might rather induce a more favorable conformation for ERα to interact with β-catenin. This may be of functional significance at physiological concentrations of the interacting proteins. Interestingly, β-catenin recruitment to EREs and ERα recruitment to TBEs in the promoters of endogenous target genes were both highly ligand-dependent. The apparently equal stimulation of ERα-β-catenin interaction by ER agonists and antagonists may have important implications for the design of novel therapeutic strategies. Our most significant finding was that ERα functionally interacted with β-catenin/Armadillo in vivo in transgenic Drosophila. The ligand-dependent transactivation function of ERα was significantly enhanced by the co-expression of stabilized Armadillo mutants. Abnormalities in the eye development induced by targeted expression of activated Armadillo and ERα were of a similar nature. Co-expression of both proteins synergistically enhanced the abnormal phenotype that was further aggravated by treatment with estradiol. Importantly, in mammals, estradiol is shown to have a prominent neuroprotective activity thought to be mediated by ER (28Wise P.M. Dubal D.B. Wilson M.E. Rau S.W. Bottner M. Rosewell K.L. Brain Res. Rev. 2001; 37: 313-319Crossref PubMed Scopus (200) Google Scholar). Physical and transcriptional interaction between β-catenin and androgen receptor has been observed previously (17Yang F. Yang F.

However, in experiments presented in these reports no interaction between β-catenin and other nuclear hormone receptors, including ER, has been detected. Thus, we have shown that Wnt and estrogen signaling pathways cross-talk in vivo through functional interaction between ERα and β-catenin. This interaction may underlie mechanisms of estrogen effects in pathological conditions and processes in which abnormalities of Wnt/β-catenin signaling have been implicated, such as in colorectal cancer. In addition, we have established a novel experimental system in which to identify factors conserved between humans and Drosophila that may be involved in regulation of cross-talk between Wnt and estrogen signaling and for the screening of novel compounds able to interfere with this cross-talk. Although other mechanisms may be involved (e.g. intranuclear sequestration), transcriptional modulation appears to be the major mechanism of functional ERα-β-catenin interaction. The genomic function of nuclear receptors is dependent on the recruitment of different coactivator and chromatin remodeling complexes (1Yanagisawa J. Kitagawa H. Yanagida M. Wada O. Ogawa S.

Yanagisawa J. Fujii-Kuriyama Y. Kato S. Nature. 2003; 423: 545-550Crossref PubMed Scopus (640) Google Scholar). β-Catenin has been shown to recruit coactivators, such as the p300/CBP complex (31Hecht A. Vleminckx K. Stemmler M.P. van Roy F. Kemler R. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 1839-1850Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), and components of the mammalian SWI/SNF and RSC chromatin remodeling complexes (32Barker N. Hurlstone A. Musisi H. Miles A. Bienz M. Clevers H. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 4935-4943Crossref PubMed Scopus (364) Google Scholar) that are also known to interact with ERα. Recruitment of additional co-activator and chromatin remodeling complexes may account for the transcriptional outcome of ERα-β-catenin interaction. The physiological consequences of this interaction may also depend on cell and tissue specificity in composition of the recruited regulatory complexes. Further experiments to identify all ERα-β-catenin complex components are required to determine whether the ERα-β-catenin interaction results only in quantitative changes in the composition of the recruited regulatory proteins or if factors specific to ERα-β-catenin protein complexes are involved."

Activation of NF-κB and induction of interleukin-8 (IL-8) and CCL-20 by the commensal Escherichia coli strain MG1655 were first studied in vitro in the human intestinal epithelial cell (IECs) lines HT29-19A and Caco-2, transfected or not with plasmids encoding dominant negative Toll-like receptor (TLR) 5 and myeloid differentiation factor-88 (MyD88) adaptor protein. The response of enterocytes in situ was then assessed using murine ileal biopsies mounted in Ussing chambers. Commensal E. coli induced NF-κB DNA binding, NF-κB transcriptional activity, CCL-20 expression, and IL-8 secretion in the human IEC lines. E. coli MG1655 flagellin was necessary and sufficient to trigger this pro-inflammatory pathway via its interaction with TLR5 and the subsequent recruitment of the adaptor protein MyD88. Following epithelial cell polarization, signaling could be induced by live E. coli and flagellin on the apical side of HT29-19A. The in vivo relevance of our findings was confirmed, because immunohistochemical staining of murine ileum demonstrated expression of TLR5 in the apical part of enterocytes in situ.

Rather than a passive barrier, the intestinal epithelium is now considered to be an integral and essential component of the innate mucosal immune system of the host (1Strober W. Ann. N. Y. Acad. Sci. 1998; 859: 37-45Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). IECs can respond to enteric pathogens (e.g. Salmonella species, Yersinia enterocolitica, and enteropathogenic Escherichia coli) either by the release of molecules directly endowed with bactericidal properties (2Hecht G. Am. J. Physiol. 1999; 277: C351-C358Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) or by the secretion of pro-inflammatory mediators (3Fierer J. Eckmann L. Kagnoff M.

Many studies have demonstrated that the response of mammalian cells to pathogens is orchestrated through the activation of the nuclear transcription factor κB (NF-κB) (8Elewaut D. DiDonato J.A.

Toll-like receptors (TLRs), some of which are expressed by enterocytes, form the best characterized family of mammalian receptors to PAMPs (10Takeda K. Kaisho T. Akira S. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 2003; 21: 335-376Crossref PubMed Scopus (4731) Google Scholar). TLRs recognize an array of prokaryote motifs, including unmethylated CpG DNA motifs, lipopolysaccharide (LPS), lipoproteins, peptidoglycan, and flagellin (10Takeda K. Kaisho T. Akira S. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 2003; 21: 335-376Crossref PubMed Scopus (4731) Google Scholar, 11Akira S. Takeda K. Kaisho T. Nat. Immunol. 2001; 2: 675-680Crossref PubMed Scopus (3925) Google Scholar, 12Athman R. Philpott D. Curr. Opin. Microbiol. 2004; 7: 25-32Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar), shared by both pathogenic and commensal bacteria, suggesting that either type of bacteria may have the potential to initiate innate immune host responses in IECs. Accordingly, Haller et al. (13Haller D. Russo M.P. Sartor R.B. Jobin C. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 38168-38178Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar) have recently shown that, following recognition of LPS by TLR4, the non-pathogenic commensal enteric bacteria Bacteroides vulgatus activates NF-κB nuclear translocation and thereafter proinflammatory gene expression in IEC lines as well as in primary enterocytes. In contrast, Neish et al. (14Neish A.S. Gewirtz A.T. Zeng H. Young A.N. Hobert M.E. Karmali V. Rao A.S. Madara J.L. Science. 2000; 289: 1560-1563Crossref PubMed Scopus (747) Google Scholar) showed that a nonpathogenic Salmonella strain not only failed to activate epithelial cells but could also prevent the pro-inflammatory response induced by a pathogenic strain of Salmonella (14Neish A.S. Gewirtz A.T. Zeng H. Young A.N. Hobert M.E. Karmali V. Rao A.S. Madara J.L. Science. 2000; 289: 1560-1563Crossref PubMed Scopus (747) Google Scholar). In addition, a recent study has shown that Bacteroides thetaiotaomicron, a prevalent anaerobe commensal of the human intestine, attenuates pro-inflammatory cytokine expression induced by a pathogenic Salmonella strain in IECs (15Kelly D. Campbell J.I. King T.P. Grant G. Jansson E.A. Coutts A.G. Pettersson S. Conway S. Nat. Immunol. 2004; 5: 104-112Crossref PubMed Scopus (849) Google Scholar). Therefore, the capacity of commensal bacteria to activate a pro-inflammatory response in IECs remains controversial. In this study, we have combined in vitro and ex vivo approaches to investigate the capacity of the E. coli MG1655 commensal strain (16Blattner F.R. Plunkett 3rd, G. Bloch C.A. Perna N.T. Burland V. Riley M. Collado-Vides J. Glasner J.D. Rode C.K. Mayhew G.F. Gregor J. Davis N.W. Kirkpatrick H.A. Goeden M.A. Rose D.J. Mau B. Shao Y. Science. 1997; 277: 1453-1474Crossref PubMed Scopus (6005) Google Scholar) to induce a pro-inflammatory response in enterocytes. This bacterial strain was chosen as a paradigm of flagellated commensal enterobacteria. Furthermore, E. coli is usually the first colonizer of the human neonatal intestine and might therefore serve to prepare intestinal colonization by other commensals that are more prominent later on in life. In vitro studies allowed us to demonstrate the ability of this commensal strain to activate the NF-κB pathway in IEC lines and to ascribe this NF-κB induction to the sole interaction of bacterial flagellin with TLR5 in enterocytes. Ex vivo studies using Ussing chambers were used to show that this pro-inflammatory pathway can also be triggered in vivo in murine ileal enterocytes. Bacteria and Culture Conditions—We chose E. coli K12 MG1655 strain as the representative of commensal non-pathogenic E. coli. It has been isolated from human stools and maintained in laboratories with minimal genetic manipulation, having only been cured of the temperate bacteriophage lambda and F plasmid, and its genome is entirely sequenced (16Blattner F.R. Plunkett 3rd, G. Bloch C.A. Perna N.T. Burland V. Riley M. Collado-Vides J. Glasner J.D. Rode C.K. Mayhew G.F. Gregor J. Davis N.W. Kirkpatrick H.A. Goeden M.A. Rose D.J. Mau B. Shao Y. Science. 1997; 277: 1453-1474Crossref PubMed Scopus (6005) Google Scholar). Wild-type (WT) E. coli MG1655 and isogenic aflagellated ΔfliC mutant were aerobically grown with shaking in Luria broth (LB) medium at 37 °C. Bacteria were harvested by centrifugation (2500 × g, 10 min) at stationary growth phase, washed two times with PBS (Invitrogen, Cergy-Pontoise, France), and subsequently diluted to obtain a final multiplicity of infection of 100 bacteria per cell. Production of Aflagellar Mutant—The ΔfliC E. coli mutant was constructed according to a method previously described (17Datsenko K.A. Wanner B.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 6640-6645Crossref PubMed Scopus (11135) Google Scholar). Briefly, PCR fragments of the Flp recognition target sequence-flanked chloramphenicol-resistant gene from the pKD3 plasmid were amplified with primers that contained a 40-bp 5′ end extension, respectively, identical or complementary to nucleotides 371–410 or 1211–1250 of the fliC gene (relative to the +1 start codon) (5′-accgcgtatctggtcagacccagttcaacggcgtgaacgttgtgtaggctggagctgcttc-3′ and 5′-gcatcgtccagcgctttcagcggatccgtggttttaccatcatatgaatatcctccttag-3′). MG1655 E. coli strain, harboring plasmid pKD46 that encodes arabinose-inducible lambda phage Red recombinase and grown in medium containing 100 mg/liter ampicillin and 0.04% l-arabinose, was transformed by electroporation with the purified PCR product. Chloramphenicol-resistant clones, which had integrated the PCR product by homologous recombination by replacing the 410–1211 nucleotides in the fliC gene, were selected on LB agar plate supplemented with 30 mg/liter chloramphenicol, grown at 37 °C, and purified at 42 °C to cure the pKD46 plasmid of the strain. The insertion of the PCR product into the fliC gene was monitored by PCR using primers, respectively, identical or complementary to the nucleotides 21–43 or 1271–1294 of the fliC gene (5′-caacagcctctcgctgatcactc-3′ and 5′-gcaccgcaccgagggaagaacgg-3′). The chloramphenicol-resistant selected clone was then electroporated with the pCP20 plasmid, which carries a thermal-inducible FLP recombinase. By growing transformants at 42 °C, the pCP20 plasmid was cured of the strain, and the chloramphenicol resistance gene was removed by site-specific recombination between the Flp recognition target sites flanking the gene, resulting in an 800-nucleotide deletion in the fliC gene (from bp 410 to 1210). The deletion was confirmed by PCR. The motility of the bacterial populations was monitored in soft agar by plating dilutions of bacterial cultures into LB supplemented with 4.5 g/liter agar. Plates were dried 30 min at room temperature and incubated at 30 °C for 24 h. Mutant ΔfliC E. coli non-motile colonies appeared as dots in contrast to WT colonies that spread out into large spots. Preparation of Bacteria-conditioned Media—After a 24-h culture in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's (DMEM, Invitrogen), bacteria were harvested by centrifugation (2500 × g, 10 min). Bacteria-CM (culture supernatant) were collected, filtrated through 0.22-μm membranes, and frozen at -80 °C until used. In some experiments, bacteria-CM were treated with pepsin and trypsin to hydrolyze proteins. Briefly, pepsin (0.15 mg/ml, pH 1.8, Sigma) was added first for 4-h incubation at 37 °C. After adjusting the pH to 7.8, trypsin (0.15 mg/ml, Sigma) was added to the solution for a further 4-h incubation at 37 °C. After enzyme inactivation at 85 °C for 45 min, pH was adjusted to 7.4 and the hydrolyzed bacteria-CM were sterilized by filtration (0.22 μm) and frozen until used. To further characterize the active bacterial product, bacteria-CM were ultrafiltrated through centrifugal filter devices Centriplus® YM-10 that retain molecules larger than 10,000 Da. Filtrated fractions were concentrated 50 times and stored at 4 °C until use. SDS-PAGE analysis of the concentrated bacteria-CM and Coomassie Blue staining revealed a single band of 55 kDa reacting with anti-flagellin antibody, which was absent in the concentrated ΔfliC E. coli-CM (see “Results,” Fig. 2, A and B). The concentration of flagellin in the bacteria-CM was therefore determined using the Bio-Rad Bradford assay, because this assay did not detect a significant amount of proteins in the concentrated ΔfliC E. coli-CM. This concentrated flagellin was used for all tests. Cell Culture and Bacterial Stimulation of IECs—The human IEC lines HT29-19A and Caco-2 were grown in DMEM supplemented with FCS (10 and 20%, respectively, Invitrogen) to 80–90% confluence in 6-well plates (Falcon®) at 37 °C in 5 and 10% CO2, respectively. After an overnight culture in medium without FCS, confluent cell monolayers were stimulated with either live WT E. coli or ΔfliC mutant at a multiplicity of infection of 100 bacteria per cell, LPS (0.1–1 μg/ml, from E. coli O111:B4, Sigma), concentrated flagellin (0.1–1000 ng/ml), or IL-1β (10 ng/ml, R&D Systems, Abingdon, UK), for 1–16 h. To prevent bacterial overgrowth in co-cultures of IECs with live E. coli, 100 μg/ml gentamicin was added after 3 h of culture. For polarized monolayers, HT29-19A and Caco-2 cells were seeded on microporous filters (Falcon™ and Costar®, respectively), at a concentration of 0.8 × 106 cells/cm2 in DMEM supplemented with FCS, for 3 weeks at 37 °C. Tightly polarized monolayers then displayed a transepithelial electrical resistance of ∼150 ohm.cm-2. Polarized intestinal cell monolayers were treated as previously described, and electrical resistances were checked at the end of the experiments. Nuclear Extracts and Electrophoretic Migration Shift Assay—HT29-19A and Caco-2 cells were stimulated for various times (1–6 h) as noted above, and nuclear extracts were prepared as previously described (18Courtois G. Whiteside S.T. Sibley C.H. Israel A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 1441-1449Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Briefly, cells were washed twice in ice-cold PBS, scraped from the dishes, and centrifuged, and the cell pellets were resuspended in hypotonic buffer (20 mm HEPES, pH 7.8, 10 mm KCl, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 0.5 mm EDTA, 0.5 mm EGTA) containing protease inhibitor mixture (1 tablet/10 ml, Roche Applied Science). After incubation on ice for 10 min, Nonidet P-40 (Sigma) was added at a final concentration of 1%, and samples were centrifuged for 5 min at 3,000 × g. Supernatants (cytoplasmic fractions) were discarded, and nuclear pellets were washed briefly with hypotonic buffer and resuspended in extraction buffer (10 mm HEPES, pH 7.8, 400 mm NaCl, 0.1 mm EDTA, 1 mm dithiothreitol, protease inhibitors, 25% glycerol). After incubation at 4 °C for 30 min with occasional vortex mixing, samples were centrifuged at 10,000 × g for 5 min. Supernatants (nuclear fractions) were recovered and frozen at -80 °C until use. Nuclear extracts (5 μg) were placed in binding buffer (10 mm HEPES, pH 7.8, 100 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, and 10% glycerol) containing 1 μg of poly(dI-dC) and 0.5 ng of 32P-labeled DNA probe corresponding to the κB site (5′-AGTTGAGGGGACTTTCCCAGG-3′, Promega, Charbonnières, France) prepared according to the manufacturer's instructions. After incubation at room temperature for 30 min, samples were run on a 5% polyacrylamide gel in Tris-borate-EDTA buffer. The gel was dried, exposed to a PhosphorImager screen (Molecular Dynamics), and analyzed with the ImageQuant software (Molecular Dynamics). For NF-κB supershift assays, antibodies against p50 or p65 subunits (10 ng/μl, Santa Cruz, CA) were added after 15 min incubation of nuclear extracts with the 32P-labeled DNA probe. Cytokine Assays—Concentrations of IL-8 and KC were measured using enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays (Duoset kits, R&D Systems). Briefly, plates were coated overnight with anti-IL-8 or anti-KC capture antibodies (4 μg/ml), and nonspecific binding sites were blocked by 1-h incubation with PBS-1% bovine serum albumin (BSA, Sigma). Culture supernatants, centrifuged for 10 min at 10,000 × g to eliminate residual bacteria, and standards were then added at appropriate dilutions, and the mixture was incubated for 2 h. Plates were subsequently added with biotinylated detection antibody (20 ng/ml) for 2 h, streptavidin-horseradish peroxidase (HRP) for 20 min, and tetramethylbenzidine, used as a substrate for HRP detection for 20 min. Absorbance values were read at 450 nm, and cytokine concentrations were determined by comparison with standard curves. Real-time Quantitative PCR for Analysis of mRNA Levels—Two micrograms of total RNA extracted from cells with an RNeasy Mini kit (Qiagen) was transcribed into cDNA using murine-Moloney leukemia virus reverse transcriptase, random hexamers, and oligo(dT) (Promega) according to standard procedures. cDNA was then amplified with SYBR-Green PCR Master Mix (Applied Biosystems) and 300 nm of the corresponding primers with 40 cycles, including denaturation at 95 °C for 15 s, annealing, and extension at 60 °C for 1 min in an ABI Prism™ 7700 sequence detection system (Applied Biosystems, software version 1.6). Primers for CCL-20 (CCAAGAGTTTGCTCCTGGCT and TGCTTGCTGCTTCTGATTCG) and glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAAGGTGAAGGTCGGAGTC and GAGGGATCTCGCTCCTGGAAGA) yielded PCR products of 75 and 244 bp, respectively. Data were normalized referring to expression of glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase. Expression Plasmids and Transient Transfections of HT29-19A and Caco-2 Cells—The NF-κB reporter Igκ-luciferase plasmid (19Munoz E. Courtois G. Veschambre P. Jalinot P. Israel A. J. Virol. 1994; 68: 8035-8044Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and the MyD88 dominant negative expression plasmid were provided by Dr. D. J. Philpott (GIIS, Institut Pasteur, Paris). Co-transfection with 0.1 μg of Renilla luciferase reporter vector (phRL-TK, Promega) was used to normalize the transfection efficiencies. Transfection was performed using Amaxa Nucleofector™ apparatus (Amaxa, Cologne, Germany) according to the manufacturer's instructions. HT-29-19A and Caco-2 cells were harvested when 50% confluent and resuspended in electroporation buffer at a final concentration of 2.5 × 107 cells/ml. 0.1 ml of cell suspension was supplied with 1 μg of the Igκ-luciferase plasmid, 0.1 μg of the Renilla luciferase reporter vector, and 1 μg of empty vector (control) or 1 μg of plasmid encoding either dominant negative TLR5 (InvivoGen, San Diego, CA) or dominant negative MyD88, and was then transferred into a 2.0-mm electroporation cuvette, and electroporated. DNA quantity, cell concentration, and buffer volume were kept constant throughout all experiments. After electroporation, cells were immediately diluted with 2.5 ml of DMEM supplemented with 5% FCS and distributed into 24-well plates at a density of 0.5 × 106 cells per well. After 24 h at 37 °C, cells were stimulated with bacteria, as described above, or treated with either IL-1β (10 ng/ml) or concentrated flagellin (100 ng/ml) for 8 h. Cells were then lysed in lysis buffer (Promega), and luciferase activity was quantified using the Dual-luciferase® reporter assay system (Promega). Western Blotting—Proteins were run on 9% SDS-PAGE gels and electrotransferred onto nitrocellulose membranes (Amersham Biosciences) at 200 mA for 45 min. Membranes were blocked using 5% nonfat dry milk in TTBS (20 mm Tris at pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, and 0.05% Tween 20) and then successively incubated with Salmonella H antiserum poly a-z (Difco, BD Biosciences) at 1:1,000 dilution in TTBS containing 1% gelatin for 2 h and with 1:5,000 dilution of HRP-conjugated donkey anti-rabbit Ig (Jackson ImmunoResearch) for 1 h. HRP was revealed with ECL-Plus light detection reagents (Amersham Biosciences) and exposure to BioMax MR film (Eastman Kodak). Stimulation of Murine Ileal Biopsies Mounted in Ussing Chambers— C3H/HeN mice, 8–12 weeks old, were raised at the breeding facility of Institut National de la Recherche Agronomique (INRA), in accordance with the regulations of the Animal Care Committee of INRA. Animals were killed by cervical dislocation, and their small intestine was removed. Ileal segments, 0.5 cm long, were taken from the middle part of the ileum, opened as a flat sheet, gently rinsed with cold Ringer solution, and laid on a Millipore filter (HAMK, 8 μm). Filter and tissue were mounted within 5 min of sampling in adapted Ussing chambers exposing a surface area of 0.15 cm2. Tissue specimens were bathed on each side with 1 ml of Ringer's solution containing the following (in mm): 140 Na+, 5.2 K+, 120 Cl-, 25 HCO3−, 1.2 Ca2+, 2.4 HPO42−, 1.2 Mg +, and 4 glutamine. The solution was thermostatted, oxygenated, and maintained at pH 7.4 by a gas flow containing 95% O2 and 5% CO2. The mucosal and serosal bathing solutions were connected by agar bridges to calomel electrodes for measurement of the transmural potential difference and to Ag-AgCl electrodes for measurement of the short-circuit current (Isc). Biopsy specimens were pulsed at 5 mV regularly, and the increase in Isc was used to calculate the electrical resistance. Electrical parameters (potential difference, Isc, resistance) were recorded at 30-min intervals for 4 h. Concentrated flagellin (500 μg/ml), LPS (100 ng/ml), or concentrated ΔfliC-conditioned medium (10 μl, corresponding to the volume of 500 μg of concentrated flagellin) were added in the serosal compartment, and after a 4-h incubation period the mucosal and the serosal compartments were collected and assayed for KC by ELISA. Immunoperoxidase Staining of Paraffin Sections—Segments of ileums from C3H/HeN mice were fixed in 4% formalin (Prolabo) and embedded in paraffin. Tissue sections, 4 μm thick, were deparaffinized, rehydrated in PBS containing 0.1% BSA, and subsequently incubated with a 1:100 dilution of polyclonal goat anti-TLR5 antibody (TLR5 N-15, Tebu-bio, Le Perray en Yvelines, France) or control goat serum for 45 min, with a 1:500 dilution of biotinylated secondary rabbit anti-goat antibody (DakoCytomation, Denmark) for 30 min and then with avidin-biotin complex (ABC) linked to HRP (Vectastain Elite ABC kit, Vector Laboratories, AbCys, Paris, France) for 30 min. All reagents were diluted in PBS-0.1% BSA, and tissue sections were washed twice in this buffer between each incubation. HRP was revealed using the VIP peroxidase substrate kit (Vector Laboratories) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Sections were counterstained with methyl green (Vector Laboratories) and mounted with VectaMount (Vector Laboratories). Anti-TLR5 staining specificity was tested following overnight preincubation of goat anti-TLR5 antibodies with TLR5 blocking peptide (sc-8695P, Tebu-bio) at a ratio 1 V/10 V, at 4 °C. Measure of Endotoxin Contamination—LPS concentration was determined using the Limulus amebocyte lysate colorimetric assay QCL-1000 from BioWhittaker according to the manufacturer's instructions. Commensal Non-pathogenic E. coli MG1655 Induces a Proinflammatory Signal in Human IECs—To determine whether a commensal E. coli can induce a pro-inflammatory response in IECs, NF-κB DNA-binding activity was assessed by electrophoretic mobility shift assay (EMSA) in the HT29-19A and Caco-2 human IEC lines that had been co-cultured with E. coli MG1655 at a multiplicity of infection of 100 bacteria per cell. As shown in Fig. 1A, stimulation by bacteria induced a strong increase in NF-κB DNA-binding activity in both cell lines after 1 h, which persisted over 6 h. For comparison, IL-1β used as a control induced only a transient increase in NF-κB DNA-binding activity, which was weaker in Caco-2 than in HT29-19A cells. Supershift assays with an antibody against the p50 subunit resulted in a partial shift of the NF-κB band, whereas this band was fully supershifted in the presence of the anti-p65 antibody (Fig. 1B), suggesting that the NF-κB binding complexes induced by commensal E. coli likely contained both p65 homodimers and p65/p50 heterodimers. NF-κB is central to the activation of several pro-inflammatory genes in human IECs, including IL-8 (8Elewaut D. DiDonato J.A. Kim J.M. Truong F. Eckmann L. Kagnoff M.F. J. Immunol. 1999; 163: 1457-1466PubMed Google Scholar, 20Savkovic S.D. Koutsouris A. Hecht G. Am. J. Physiol. 1997; 273: C1160-1167Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). IL-8 was therefore measured in culture supernatants by ELISA after 16 h of stimulation. As shown in Fig. 1C, E. coli stimulation, similar to IL-1β stimulation, induced the secretion of IL-8 in the two IEC lines tested, indicating that NF-κB DNA-binding activity resulted in the induction of cytokine secretion. LPS of the commensal bacteria B. vulgatus was recently shown to activate the NF-κB signaling pathway in rat IECs (13Haller D. Russo M.P. Sartor R.B. Jobin C. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 38168-38178Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar). The pro-inflammatory effect of whole E. coli MG1655 was therefore compared with those of E. coli-conditioned medium (E. coli-CM) and E. coli LPS. E. coli-CM induced NF-κB activity (not shown) and IL-8 secretion in HT29-19A and Caco-2 cells as efficiently as whole bacteria, whereas LPS had no stimulatory effect even at a concentration of 1 μg/ml (Fig. 1D). Furthermore, addition of polymyxin B (10 μg/ml) to the E. coli-CM did not decrease its stimulatory effect, whereas its activity was abolished after treatment with proteases (Fig. 1D), pointing to the role of a proteinaceous factor. The Pro-inflammatory Signal Delivered by Commensal E. coli Is Mediated by Flagellin and Activation of the TLR5-MyD88 Signaling Pathway—SDS-PAGE analysis of E. coli-CM and Coomassie Blue staining revealed a prominent protein band with an estimated molecular mass of 55 kDa, which was similar to that of E. coli flagellin (Fig. 2A). The identity of the 55-kDa band was confirmed by its immunoreactivity with an antiserum against Salmonella H7 flagellin and the absence of this protein in preparations from an isogenic E. coli ΔfliC aflagellar mutant of the commensal E. coli MG1655 (Fig. 2B). When tested in soft agar, the ΔfliC E. coli mutant colonies appeared as dots in contrast to WT colonies, which spread out into large spots (Fig. 2C). The non-motile phenotype confirmed that the mutant strain was aflagellated. Flagellin from different bacterial strains was shown to induce IL-8 secretion and CCL-20 expression in several in vitro models of IECs (21Sierro F. Dubois B. Coste A. Kaiserlian D. Kraehenbuhl J.P.

Infect Immun. 2003; 71: 2120-2129Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar). Flagellin, concentrated from E. coli MG1655-CM, induced the secretion of IL-8 and increased the levels of CCL-20-encoding mRNA in both HT29-19A and Caco-2 cells (Fig. 2, D and E, respectively). This effect was dose-dependent, and a concentration of 10 ng/ml was sufficient for a significant stimulation. Moreover, the efficiency of 100 ng/ml flagellin concentrated from E. coli was comparable to that observed with similar amounts of flagellin purified from Salmonella typhimurium (data not shown).

In periphery, they contribute to sensory transmission, including that of nociception and pain. Here we characterized ASIC-like currents in dorsal horn neurons of the rat spinal cord and their functional modulation in pathological conditions. Reverse transcriptase-nested PCR and Western blotting showed that three ASIC isoforms, ASIC1a, ASIC2a, and ASIC2b, are expressed at a high level in dorsal horn neurons. Electrophysiological and pharmacological properties of the proton-gated currents suggest that homomeric ASIC1a and/or heteromeric ASIC1a + 2b channels are responsible for the proton-induced currents in the majority of dorsal horn neurons. Acidification-induced action potentials in these neurons were compatible in a pH-dependent manner with the pH dependence of ASIC-like current. Furthermore, peripheral complete Freund's adjuvant-induced inflammation resulted in increased expression of both ASIC1a and ASIC2a in dorsal horn.

In particular, increased expression of ASIC1a, ASIC2b, and ASIC3 in the DRG was detected after peripheral inflammation (23Voilley N. de Weille J. Mamet J. Lazdunski M. J. Neurosci. 2001; 21: 8026-8033Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The increased ASIC expression may contribute to the enhanced excitability of the DRG neuron after inflammation (24Mamet J. Baron A. Lazdunski M. Voilley N. J. Neurosci. 2002; 22: 10662-10670Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The roles of ASICs in nociception, however, are not limited to the DRG cells (25Scholz J. Woolf C.J. Nat. Neurosci. 2002; 5: 1062-1067Crossref PubMed Scopus (690) Google Scholar). The dorsal horn of spinal cord, the first central site for integration, relay, and modulation of nociceptive information, is an important area to investigate. For example, transcripts of ASICs have been localized to the spinal cord (10Chen C.C. England S. Akopian A.N. Wood J.N. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 10240-10245Crossref PubMed Scopus (403) Google Scholar, 26Alvarez de la Rosa D. Krueger S.R. Kolar A. Shao D. Fitzsimonds R.M. Canessa C.M. J. Physiol. (Lond.). 2003; 546: 77-87Crossref Scopus (181) Google Scholar), and acid-activated currents have been detected in cultured spinal ventral horn neurons (27Li Y.X. Schaffner A.E. Li H.R. Nelson R. Barker J.L. Brain. Res. Dev. Brain Res. 1997; 102: 261-266Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar). However, less is known about the molecular identity and functional roles of ASICs in spinal dorsal horn neurons. In the present study, we have investigated the functional and biochemical properties of ASICs in dorsal horn neurons of the rat spinal cord by using conventional whole-cell patch clamp electrophysiology, reverse transcriptase (RT)-nested PCR, and Western blotting techniques. Comparison of the properties with those of cloned ASIC channels suggests that homomeric ASIC1a and/or heteromeric ASIC1a + 2b channels are responsible for the proton-induced currents in the majority of dorsal horn neurons. Acidification-induced action potentials in these neurons, as well as the increased expression of the spinal ASICs by periphery inflammation, suggests the physiological involvement of ASICs in central pain sensing under physiological and/or pathological conditions. Isolation of Neurons—The experimental protocols were approved by our Institutional Care and Use of Animals Committee. The dorsal horn neurons were mechanically dissociated from rat spinal cord as described previously (28Li Y.F. Wu L.J. Li Y. Xu L. Xu T.L. J. Physiol. (Lond.). 2003; 552: 73-87Crossref Scopus (30) Google Scholar). In brief, 2-week-old Wistar rats were sacrificed by decapitation, and a segment of lumbosacral (L4-S2) spinal cord was dissected out. Thereafter, transverse slices at 400 μm were sectioned with a vibratome tissue slicer (VT1000S, Leica instruments, Ltd., Wetzlar, Germany) in the incubation solution (see “Solutions and Drugs” for the composition). A vibration-isolation system (29Wu L.J. Lu Y. Xu T.L. J. Neurosci. Methods. 2001; 108: 199-206Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar) was then used to mechanically dissociate dorsal horn neurons from the slices. Briefly, a fire-polished glass pipette mounted on a vibrator touched lightly and vibrated horizontally at about 5–10 Hz on the surface of the slices under the control of a pulse generator. The vibration-dissociation lasted for about 10 min, and then the slices were removed from the dish. Within 20 min after dissociation, isolated dorsal horn neurons attached to the bottom of the culture dish and the fusiform cells with oval or triangular soma (15–25 μm in diameter) were selected for electrophysiological experiments. Cell Culture and Transfection—All constructs were expressed in HEK293T cells. HEK293T cells were cultured at 37 °C in a humidified atmosphere of 5% CO2 and 95% air. The cells were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (Invitrogen) supplemented with 2 mm l-glutamine, 10% fetal bovine serum, and 100 units/ml penicillin/streptomycin. Transient transfection of HEK293T cells was carried out using the conventional calcium phosphate method. Co-transfection with a green fluorescent protein expression vector, pEGFP, was used to enable identification of transfected cells for patch clamping by monitoring its fluorescence. When more than one of the ASIC subunits were expressed, the multiplasmids were co-tranfected in a 1:1 ratio. Electrophysiological measurements were performed 16–48 h after transfection. GW1-CMV-ASIC1a and GW1-CMV-ASIC2a were generous gifts from Dr. Jun Xia (The Hong Kong University of Science and Technology, Hong Kong, China). pN1z-ASIC2b was kindly provided by Dr. Philip K. Ahring (NeuroSearch A/S, Ballerup, Denmark). pEGFP was from Dr. Jian-hong Luo (Zhejiang University Faculty of Medicine, Hangzhou, China). Solutions and Drugs—The ionic composition of the incubation solution was (mm): 124 NaCl, 24 NaHCO3, 5 KCl, 1.2 KH2PO4, 2.4 CaCl2, 1.3 MgSO4, and 10 glucose, aerated with 95% O2/5% CO2 to a final pH of 7.4. The standard external solution contained (mm): 150 NaCl, 5 KCl, 1 MgCl2, 2 CaCl2, and 10 glucose, buffered to various pH values with either 10 mm HEPES, pH 6.0–7.4, or 10 mm MES, pH <6.0. In Na+-free medium, Na+ was substituted with equimolar NMDG, and in Ca2+-free medium, Ca2+ was substituted with 5 mm EGTA. The glucose-free solution was prepared by replacing glucose with equimolar mannitol. The patch pipette solution for whole-cell patch recording was (mm): 120 KCl, 30 NaCl, 1 MgCl2, 0.5 CaCl2, 5 EGTA, 2 Mg-ATP, 10 HEPES. The internal solution was adjusted to pH 7.2 with Tris base. When the current-voltage relationships for proton-induced currents were examined, 300 nm tetrodotoxin and 200 μm CdCl2 were added to the standard external solution, and K+ was substituted with Cs+ in the internal solution. For measurement of the permeability of monovalent cations, the internal solution contained (mm) 160 NaCl, 10 EGTA, and 10 HEPES, and the external solution contained (mm) 160 test cation (X), 10 HEPES, and 12 glucose. The relative permeability of Cs+ and K+ was measured by comparing the reversal potentials when electrodes contained CsCl, KCl, or NaCl with extracellular NaCl in each case. Because of the inhibition of proton-induced currents by external Ca2+, Ca2+ permeability was measured under low Ca2+ external solution containing (mm) 5 CaCl2, 150 NMDG, 10 HEPES, and 12 glucose, and the internal solution contained (mm) 160 NaCl, 5 EGTA, and 10 HEPES. The osmolarity and pH of all these solutions were maintained at 300–325 milliosmole/liter (Advanced Instrument, Norwood, MA) and 7.2–7.4, respectively. All drugs were from Sigma (St. Louis, MO). Drugs were applied using a rapid application technique termed the “Y-tube” method throughout the experiments (28Li Y.F. Wu L.J. Li Y. Xu L. Xu T.L. J. Physiol. (Lond.). 2003; 552: 73-87Crossref Scopus (30) Google Scholar). This system allows a complete exchange of external solution surrounding a neuron within 20 ms. Electrophysiology—The electrophysiological recordings were performed in the conventional whole-cell patch recording configuration under voltage clamp or current clamp conditions. Patch pipettes were pulled from glass capillaries with an outer diameter of 1.5 mm on a two-stage puller (PP-830, Narishige Co., Ltd., Tokyo, Japan). The resistance between the recording electrode filled with pipette solution and the reference electrode was 4–6 MΩ. Membrane currents or potentials were measured using a patch clamp amplifier (Axon 200B, Axon Instruments, Foster City, CA) and were sampled and analyzed using a Digidata 1320A interface and a computer with the Clampex and Clamp-fit software (version 8.0.1, Axon Instruments). In most experiments, 70–90% series resistance was compensated. Unless otherwise noted, the membrane potential was held at –50 mV throughout the experiment, under voltage clamp conditions. All the experiments were carried out at room temperature (22–25 °C). Inflammation Experiments—Right hindpaws of anesthetized Wistar rats (4–5 weeks old) were inflamed by an injection of 100 μl of complete Freund's adjuvant (CFA) (50%). Both hindpaws were tested individually for withdrawal latency by measuring the response to the radiant heat stimulus. In brief, the inflamed animals were placed in individual plexiglass cages and allowed to acclimate to the testing environment for 30 min. Thereafter, radiant heat was turned on and focused on a small region of their hindpaws. When the animals withdrew their paws, stimulation ended. Both treated and untreated paws were tested so that each animal was its own control. The interval between tests of the same paw was at least 5 min. The average of five tests on each paw at each time point represented the withdrawal latency. L4–L5 spinal cords were removed at 1 h, 1 day, and 3 days after injection. The removed spinal cord was divided laterally into an ipsi- and contralateral half. The latter one was used as the negative control. Vehicle-injected rats were used as controls. RT-PCR Experiments—The sequences of primers used in this study are listed as follows: P1, 5′-ATGGAATTGAAGACCGAGGAGGAG-3′; P2, 5′-CGCTGCAGGCCTCCCCACGGAAGT-3′; P3, 5′-ATGGACCTCAAGGAGAGCCCCAGT-3′; P4, 5′-GATGCCCACACTCCTGCCCCTTGA-3′; P5, 5′-ACCGCGCTCAGCGGC-3′; P6, 5′-GCGGCAGGAAGAGGC-3′; P7, 5′-ATGCCCATCCAGATCTTTTGTTCT-3′; P8, 5′-AGAAAGCCTCTGGGCCAGGAGGAG-3′; P9, 5′-ATGAAACCTCGCTCCGGACTGGAG-3′; P10, 5′-GATCACTGTGAAGTTCTCAGGCCC-3′; P11, 5′-GAGGAGGAGGAGGTGGGTGGTGTC-3′; P12, 5′-CACGGAAGTGGCACGAGAGCAGCA-3′; P13, 5′-AGCCCCAGTGAGGGCAGCCTGCAA-3′; P14, 5′-GCCCCTTGAACTTGCAGTAGAGCA-3′; P15, 5′-ACCGCGCTCAGCGGC-3′; P16, 5′-GCGGCTCGTCGCCCCGCA-3′. Total RNA of spinal cord was extracted using an RNA extraction kit (Promega). One μg of total RNA was used as a template for cDNA synthesis and subsequent amplification with the One Step RNA PCR kit (Takara Shuzo, Kyoto, Japan). Primer pairs P1/P2, P3/P4, P5/P6, P7/P8, and P9/P10 were used for amplification of the transcripts of ASIC1a, ASIC2a, ASIC2b, ASIC1b, and ASIC3, respectively. To confirm the transcription of ASICs in dorsal horn neurons, the RT-nested PCR method was applied to amplify ASIC1a, ASIC2a, and ASIC2b, which are implicated to be expressed mainly in the central nervous system (4Reeh P.W. Kress M. Curr. Opin. Pharmacol. 2001; 1: 45-51Crossref PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar). In brief, 20–30 acutely isolated dorsal horn neurons were suctioned into a suction pipette (the tip diameter is 30–50 μm). Thereafter, the neurons were lysed, and the lysate was then used as a template for the RT-nested PCR. The primary RT-PCR was the same as described under “RT-PCR Experiments.” A nested secondary PCR amplification was then performed to amplify the smaller ASIC1a, ASIC2a, and ASIC2b fragments, using the primers of P11/P12, P13/P14, and P15/P16 respectively. PCR products were analyzed on 1% agarose gels by ethidium bromide staining. The purified PCR products were then subcloned into pGEM-T vector. DNA sequence verification was performed using the ABI Prism (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA), automated sequencing method. Western Blotting—Spinal cord was lysed in lysis buffer (150 mmol/liter Nacl, 1.0% Nonidet P-40, 0.5% deoxycholate, 0.1% SDS, 50 mmol/liter Tris, pH 8.0) supplemented with protease inhibitor mixture (Roche Applied Science). Protein concentration was determined by the BCA-200 protein assay kit (Pierce). The lysates (20 μg) were resolved by denaturing 12% SDS-PAGE and then transferred to nitrocellulose membranes. The membranes were probed with primary affinity-purified rabbit polyclonal antibody against ASIC1a, ASIC2a, and ASIC2b (Alpha Diagnostic International, San Antonio, TX) followed by secondary goat anti-rabbit alkaline phosphatase-conjugated antibody (Promega). The blots were then developed with the Western Blue® stabilized substrate for alkaline phosphatase. Data Analysis—Results were expressed as the mean ± S.E. Statistical comparisons were made with the Student's t test. Analysis of variance (ANOVA) for multiple comparisons was used as noted. In all cases, p < 0.05 (*) or 0.01 (**) was considered significant as shown in Figs. 2, 6, and 7. The permeability ratio of PX/PNa was calculated from the modified Goldmann-Hodgkin-Katz equation: PX/PNa = exp (ΔVrevF/RT) due to the equimolar cations in external and internal solution, where ΔVrev is the change in reversal potential when Na+ was replaced by the tested cation, F is the Faraday constant, R is the gas constant, and T is the absolute temperature. PNa/PCa was calculated from: PNa/PCa = [Na+]i exp (VrevF/RT) (1 + exp(VrevF/RT))/4[Ca2+]o. We consider the effect of NMDG negligible in the equation, as it is nearly impermeable to ASICs.Fig. 6Up-regulation of dorsal horn ASIC1a and ASIC2a proteins by periphery inflammation.A, changes in paw withdrawal latency (PWL) of the rat after CFA injection.

Krishtal O.A. Maruyama T. J. Neurophysiol. 1990; 63: 805-813Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar, 31Baron A. Waldmann R. Lazdunski M. J. Physiol. (Lond.). 2002; 539: 485-494Crossref Scopus (185) Google Scholar); however, no studies have been reported on spinal dorsal horn neurons. To investigate the ASIC-like currents in acutely dissociated spinal dorsal horn neurons, whole-cell patch clamp recordings were used, and acidic pH-buffered solution was applied. At a holding potential (VH) of –50 mV, fast reduction of extracellular pH evoked rapidly desensitizing inward currents with an average decay time constant of 1.18 ± 0.37 s in most neurons (181/200), the amplitude of which increased with decreasing extracellular pH, with the threshold around pH 7.0–6.8 and a half-maximum activation (pH50) value of pH 6.38 (Fig. 1A). The average amplitude of pH 6.0-induced currents was 420.5 ± 63.6 pA (n = 15). The currents could be reversibly inhibited by amiloride, a selective antagonist for cloned ASICs (7Waldmann R. Champigny G. Bassilana F. Heurteaux C. Lazdunski M. Nature. 1997; 386: 173-177Crossref PubMed Scopus (1155) Google Scholar), in a dose-dependent manner, with the half-maximal inhibition (IC50) value of 16.2 μm (Fig. 1B). Interestingly, in a minority of neurons (19/200), the pH 6.0 solution evoked responses with much longer duration (decay time of 4.52 ± 0.69 s, data not shown). Because of the low incidence, we did not include this minority in the present study. Therefore, we only focused on the rapidly decaying proton-evoked current in the following assays. The reversal potential of the currents, estimated from the current-voltage relationships, was 35.3 ± 2.8 mV (n = 11), which is close to the theoretical Na+ equilibrium potential (41.2 mV) calculated with the Nernst equation for the given extra- and intracellular Na+ concentrations (150 and 30 mm, respectively). When the extracellular Na+ was substituted by NMDG, the amplitude of the current was remarkably inhibited (Fig. 1C). These results suggest that the proton-induced currents are mainly due to an increase of the Na+ conductance. For quantitative estimation of the permeability of the proton-gated channel for cations, a voltage ramp protocol was applied under bi-ionic conditions (Fig. 1D). When equimolar Na+ was present in both the intracellular and extracellular solutions, the proton-induced currents exhibited a reversal potential close to 0 mV (–2.0 ± 1.1 mV, n = 5) as expected. Substitution of extracellular Na+ with Li+ shifted the reversal potential to 9.4 ± 0.9 mV (n = 5), and substitution of intracellular Na+ with K+ or Cs+ shifted the reversal potential to 48.9 ± 6.3 mV (n = 7) and 56.2 ± 9.8 mV (n = 5), respectively. The reversal potential moved to –73.4 ± 2.5 mV (n = 6) when low Ca2+ external solution was applied. Relative permeability ratios were then calculated (Fig. 1E) according to the method described under “Materials and Methods.” These results indicate that the channel underlying the proton-induced currents in rat dorsal horn neurons is permeable to Na+, Li+, Ca2+, K+, and Cs+ with a permeability preference of PNa > PLi > PCa > PK > PCs. Different ASIC subunits have different sensitivity to extracellular Ca2+ and Zn2+ ([Ca2+]o and [Zn2+]o) (7Waldmann R. Champigny G. Bassilana F. Heurteaux C. Lazdunski M. Nature. 1997; 386: 173-177Crossref PubMed Scopus (1155) Google Scholar, 32Baron A. Schaefer L. Lingueglia E. Champigny G. Lazdunski M. J. Biol.

Thus, we tested the effects of Ca2+ and Zn2+ on the proton-induced currents, which would help us identify the subunit composition of ASICs underlying the current in dorsal horn neurons. As shown in Fig. 2A, pH (6.0)-gated current was inhibited by high [Ca2+]o and was almost eliminated in 20 mm [Ca2+]o. The IC50 of [Ca2+]o inhibition was 4.1 mm. The underlying mechanisms of Ca2+ modulation of ASICs have been proposed to be an extracellular effect by several groups (33de Weille J. Bassilana F. Brain Res. 2001; 900: 277-281Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar, 34Immke D.C. McCleskey E.W. Neuron. 2003; 37: 75-84Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (214) Google Scholar). However, considering the relatively high Ca2+ permeability for the native channel in the present preparation, it is possible that the effects of extracellular Ca2+ are because of the feedback inhibition by Ca2+ influx. To study this possibility, intracellular pipette solution with high Ca2+ was used. However, we did not observe any inhibition of proton-induced current by intracellular high Ca2+ (see Supplement 1). The modulation of [Zn2+]o was then studied. As shown in Fig. 2B, [Zn2+]o exerted no significant inhibition on the peak amplitude of the currents. Interestingly, [Zn2+]o produced a biphasic modulatory effect on the decay time constant (τ) of the currents (Fig. 2B). In particular, the averaged τ was decreased by 1 μm [Zn2+]o to 77.2 ± 3.8% (p < 0.05, n = 8), and increased by 1 mm [Zn2+]o to 182.2 ± 12.7% (p < 0.01, n = 8) of the control value activated by pH 6.0. RT-PCR and Biochemical Study of ASICs in Dorsal Horn Neurons—Next, we performed RT-PCR to examine the molecular identity of ASICs in the dorsal horn of rat spinal cord. We did not consider ASIC4 in the present study, because it was found unresponsive to a drop in pH in either homomeric or heteromeric form (11Grunder S. Geissler H.S. Bassler E.L. Ruppersberg J.P. Neuroreport. 2000; 11: 1607-1611Crossref PubMed Scopus (198) Google Scholar, 12Akopian A.N. Chen C.C. Ding Y. Cesare P. Wood J.N. Neuroreport. 2000; 11: 2217-2222Crossref PubMed Scopus (183) Google Scholar). As shown in Fig. 3A, ASIC1a, ASIC2a, and ASIC2b were prominent isoforms, whereas ASIC1b and ASIC3 were not detected in the dorsal horn. Further DNA sequencing of the PCR products confirmed their identity as the expected portions of the corresponding genes. Consistent with this result, our Western blotting analysis showed that ASIC1a, ASIC2a, and ASIC2b proteins were expressed at high level in the dorsal horn (Fig. 3B). To verify directly the ASIC expression in individual dorsal horn neurons, we performed RT-nested PCR using 20–30 isolated neurons. Abundant expression of the ASIC1a, ASIC2a, and ASIC2b transcripts were detected in these neurons (Fig. 3C). The ratios of band intensity (normalized to β-actin) of ASIC1a to ASIC2a and ASIC2b in Fig. 3 are 1.83 and 1.67, respectively. The expression of ASIC1a, ASIC2a, and ASIC2b suggests that the possible ASIC channels responsible for the proton-induced currents are homomeric ASIC1a, ASIC2a, or heteromeric ASIC1a + 2a, ASIC2a + 2b, ASIC1a + 2b, ASIC1a + 2a + 2b. All these cloned channels have been well studied in an in vitro expression system, except ASIC1a + 2b and ASIC1a + 2a + 2b (7Waldmann R. Champigny G. Bassilana F. Heurteaux C. Lazdunski M.

Table I summarizes the properties of the proton-gated currents detected in the present preparation and those of homomeric ASIC1a or ASIC2a and heteromeric ASIC1a + 2a or ASIC2a + 2b, showing that the present current phenotype (but not the other three) was best matched to homomeric ASIC1a-mediated current. To further assess the possible involvement of ASIC1a + 2b and ASIC1a + 2a + 2b, we studied ASICs transfected in HEK293T cells. Desensitization time constant (τdes) and the ratio of sustained current and peak current (Isus/Ipeak) were tested (Fig. 4). The τdes of ASIC1a + 2a + 2b channel was significantly slower than t"
https://openalex.org/W2111061591,"Previous studies suggest native cardiac IKr channels are composed of alpha subunits encoded solely by the 1a transcript of the ERG1 gene. Using isoform-specific ERG1 antibodies, we have new evidence that subunits encoded by an alternate transcript, ERG1b, are also expressed in rat, canine, and human heart. The ERG1a and -1b subunits associate in vivo where they localize to the T tubules of ventricular myocytes. These data indicate native ventricular IKr channels are heteromers containing two α subunit types, ERG1a and -1b. The hERG1b-specific exon thus represents a novel target to screen for mutations causing type 2 long QT syndrome. These findings also suggest phenotypic analyses of existing type 2 long QT syndrome mutations, especially those exclusive to the hERG1a amino terminus, should be carried out in systems expressing both subunits.

Human male ventricular tissue was a gift from Dr. Timothy Kamp, (Dept. of Medicine, University of Wisconsin, Madison). Canine ventricular myocytes, a gift from the laboratory of Dr. Rob Haworth (Dept. of Surgery, University of Wisconsin, Madison), were isolated from mongrel males and enzymatically treated as previously described (11He J.Q.

Rat ventricular myocytes were prepared using the same procedure as described for the canine tissue. All procedures have been approved by the Research Animal Resources Center at University of Wisconsin, Madison. Cell Membrane Protein Preparations—Membranes were prepared from myocytes or ventricular tissue after suspension in homogenization buffer (25 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 10 mm NaEGTA, 20 mm NaEDTA). All buffers used in this procedure contained the following protease inhibitor mixture: 5 μg/ml aprotinin, 50 μg/ml 1,10-phenanthroline, 0.7 μg/ml pepstatin A, 1.56 μg/ml benzamidine, and 1× Complete minitab (Roche Applied Science). Suspensions were homogenized using a Polytron homogenizer at setting 6 for two bursts of 15 s each followed by sonication on ice twice at an amplitude of 20 for 20 s each. Suspensions were spun at 2,000 × g at 4 °C for 10 min to remove cellular debris. The supernatants were subject to further centrifugation at 40,000 × g for 30 min at 4 °C. The resultant pellet was solubilized on a rotary shaker at 4 °C for 2 h in either Triton buffer (150 mm NaCl, 25 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 20 mm NaEDTA, 10 mm NaEGTA, 5 mm glucose, and 1% (v/v) Triton X-100), or RIPA buffer (150 mm NaCl, 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 1 mm NaEDTA, and 1% (v/v) Triton X-100, 1% (v/v) sodium deoxycholate, 0.1% (v/v) sodium dodecylsulfate). Samples were then spun at 10,000 × g to remove insoluble material. Cell line membrane pellets were prepared by washing plates gently with PBS, aspirating, and adding either Triton buffer or RIPA buffer. Cells were then scraped, collected in a microcentrifuge tube, and sonicated on ice twice at an amplitude of 20 for 20 s each. The suspension was rotated at 4 °C for 2 h and then centrifuged at 10,000 × g for 10 min to remove insoluble material. Protein concentrations of all samples were determined using a modified Bradford assay (DC Protein Assay, Bio-Rad). Biochemical Analysis—Membrane proteins were deglycosylated using PNGase F and endoglycosidase H (Roche Applied Science) as described previously (8Zhou Z. Gong Q. Ye B. Fan Z. Makielski J.C.

Briefly, 100 mm tissue culture dishes with growth at 70–80% confluency were rinsed three times with cold PBS and incubated with freshly prepared biotin reagent (5 mg/ml) in PBS for 45 min at 4 °C. Cells were then rinsed once with 25 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, to quench the reaction, followed by three washes with cold PBS. Membrane proteins were prepared as indicated above. Western Blot Analysis—Membrane proteins (cell lines 2–10 μg/lane, heart lysates 30–50 μg/lane) were electrophoresed on 7.5% SDS-polyacrylamide gels along with prestained molecular weight markers (Bio-Rad) and then transferred to Immobilon-P polyvinylidene difluoride membranes (Millipore, Bedford, MA) for 1 h at 100 mV. Western blots were blocked, probed, and analyzed as described earlier (10Roti Roti E.C. Myers C.D. Ayers R.A. Boatman D.E. Delfosse S.A. Chan E.K.L. Ackerman M.J. January C.T. Robertson G.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 47779-47785Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). For peptide block experiments 5 μl of antibody was incubated with 10 μg of peptide in 100 μl of TBS (150 mm NaCl, 25 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4) for 6 h at 4 °C and then centrifuged at 10,000 × g for 20 min. The supernatant was carefully removed and used to probe Western blots. Western blot controls include probing blots with secondary antibody alone and peptide block of primary antibody. In the case of heart lysates, a lane containing hERG1a/1b cell membrane preparation was included as a positive control. Co-immunoprecipitation—Membrane lysates (cell lines 100–200 μg/reaction, heart lysates 500–1000 μg/reaction) in 1 ml of TBS were cleared with 50 μl of protein A- or G-Sepharose beads (Amersham Biosciences) depending on the origin of the immunoprecipitating antibody; protein A was used for rabbit and protein G for goat immunoprecipitating antibodies. Cleared lysates were incubated with antibody (ERG1b at 1:100 or N-20 at 1:20) on a rotating platform for 3–16 h at 4 °C. 50 μl of protein A- or G-coupled beads were added and samples were incubated at 4 °C for an additional 1–3 h. Beads were collected by centrifugation at 10,000 × g and washed three times with 150 mm NaCl, 25 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 5 mm NaEDTA, 1% (v/v) Trition X-100, followed by one wash with 150 mm NaCl, 25 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4. Proteins were eluted with 200 ng/ml antibody-specific peptide for 1 h at 4 °C. Samples were centrifuged at 10,000 × g, and the supernatant was collected. 100 μl of LSB (25 mm Tris-HCl, pH 6.8, 2% (v/v) sodium dodecylsulfate, 10% glycerol) was added to the beads to elute any proteins that remained bound. Additional controls included lysates processed without antibody. Eluted proteins were Western blotted as described above. Immunohistochemistry—Isolated canine myocytes were fixed in 2% paraformaldehyde-PBS, pH 7.4, for 10 min at room temperature and washed three times in PBS, pH 7.4. Myocytes were then either stored at 4 °C (for up to 8 weeks) or processed immediately. Myocytes were washed once in PBS, pH 7.4, + 1% Triton X-100 and permeabilized in PBS, pH 7.4, + 0.5% Triton X-100 for 10 min at room temperature followed by incubation in 0.75% glycine-PBS (pH 7.4) for 10 min at room temperature to quench any free aldehydes and incubation in blocking buffer (PBS, pH 7.4, + 0.1% Tween-20 + 10% donkey serum + 2% bovine serum albumin) for 2 h at 4 °C with rotation. Cells were washed three times with PBS, pH 7.4, + 0.1% Tween-20 and divided into 0.5-ml aliquots. Each myocyte aliquot was incubated overnight at 4 °C in diluted primary antibody. ERG1b antibodies were diluted 1:1000, ERG1a antibodies (N-20) were diluted 1:10, and myosin binding protein C antibodies were diluted 1:500. Myocytes were washed three times for 1 h in PBS, pH 7.4, + 0.1% Tween-20. Secondary antibodies were diluted in PBS, pH 7.4, + 0.1% Tween-20, + 5% bovine serum albumin, and spun to remove any aggregates. Myocytes were suspended in 0.5 ml of diluted secondary antibody and incubated in the dark 2 h at room temperature with rotation. Donkey anti-rabbit Alexa 488 and donkey anti-goat Alexa 568 antibodies were diluted 1:1000. Myocytes were washed briefly 3x with PBS, pH 7.4, + 0.1% Tween-20 followed by two 1-h washes with PBS, pH 7.4, and were stored at 4 °C until viewed on a Zeiss Axiovert 200 microscope with a ×63 objective. Optical sectioning was accomplished using the Apotome, and three-dimensional rendering was conducted within Axiovision software. Fluorescent excitation-emission filter set for Alexa 488 (excitation 450–490 nm, emission 515–565 nm) and Alexa 568 (excitation 500–639 nm, emission 560–700 nm) do not overlap. Species specificity of secondary antibodies was confirmed by incubating cells probed with one primary with secondary antibody raised against the other species. No signal was detected demonstrating each secondary is species specific. Secondary alone controls were also used to ensure the signal was specific. We initially observed an ERG1b-sized band on a Western blot of rat heart tissue when we probed with a novel, carboxylterminal ERG1 antibody termed KA, generated as a tool for a related study (10Roti Roti E.C. Myers C.D. Ayers R.A. Boatman D.E. Delfosse S.A. Chan E.K.L. Ackerman M.J. January C.T. Robertson G.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 47779-47785Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). As shown in Fig. 1B, the ERG1-KA antibody identified three bands at 160, 120, and 95 kDa. The two higher molecular mass bands are consistent in size with maturely glycosylated and unglycosylated rat ERG1a, respectively (6Pond A.L. Scheve B.K. Benedict A.T. Petrecca K. Van Wagoner D.R. Shrier A. Nerbonne J.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 5997-6006Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar). The 95-kDa band is consistent in size with ERG1b protein produced in heterologous expression systems (see below) but not observed previously in native tissue. The 95-kDa band cannot represent ERG-USO, another hERG1 transcript that produces a protein of approximately the same size (13Kupershmidt S. Snyders D.J. Raes A. Roden D.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 27231-27235Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar) because ERG-USO does not contain the carboxyl-terminal sequence against which the ERG1-KA antibody was raised. To test the hypothesis that the 95-kDa band represents ERG1b, we generated antibodies specific to the ERG1a and ERG1b amino termini. Fig. 2 shows the characterization of the two antisera and the pan-ERG1 antibody ERG1-KA on Western blots of membrane proteins prepared from HEK-293 cells stably expressing hERG1a and -1b. The ERG1-KA antibody recognized bands at 155 and 135 kDa, consistent with previously published results identifying these bands as mature and immature hERG1 glycoforms, respectively (Fig. 2A, Lane 1) (8Zhou Z. Gong Q. Ye B. Fan Z. Makielski J.C. Robertson G.A. January C.T. Biophys. J. 1998; 74: 230-241Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (623) Google Scholar). In addition, ERG1-KA recognized three lower molecular mass bands at 95, 85, and 80 kDa. The 95- and 85-kDa bands are consistent with bands attributed to hERG1b in tumor cell lines (14Crociani O. Guasti L. Balzi M. Becchetti A. Wanke E. Olivotto M. Wymore R.S. Arcangeli A. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 2947-2955Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (174) Google Scholar) and heterologously expressed in QT-6 cells (6Pond A.L. Scheve B.K. Benedict A.T. Petrecca K. Van Wagoner D.R. Shrier A. Nerbonne J.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 5997-6006Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar). As expected, blots probed with the ERG1a-specific antibody recognized the 155- and 135-kDa bands but not the three lower-mass bands (Fig. 2A, Lane 2). The 155- and 135-kDa bands were eliminated upon incubation of the ERG1a antisera with the antigenic 1a peptide prior to probing the blots (Lane 3). The ERG1b-specific antibody recognized the 95-, 85-, and 80-kDa bands but not the two higher mass hERG1a bands (Lane 4). These bands were similarly eliminated by preincubation of the antisera with the antigenic 1b peptide (Lane 5). These data show that ERG1-KA antisera recognize both 1a and 1b isoforms and that ERG1a and -1b antisera are specific for their corresponding isoforms. Membrane proteins from stable HEK-293 hERG1a/1b cell lines were incubated with glycosidases to determine whether the multiple hERG1b bands on Western blots correspond to different glycoforms as shown previously for the hERG1a 155- and 135-kDa bands (8Zhou Z. Gong Q. Ye B. Fan Z. Makielski J.C. Robertson G.A. January C.T. Biophys. J. 1998; 74: 230-241Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (623) Google Scholar). Removing all glycans from the hERG1b proteins by incubating membrane preparations with PNGase F reduced the higher molecular mass hERG1b species to a single 80-kDa band (Fig. 2B, Lane 2). Digestion with endoglycosidase H, which removes only glycans that are attached in the endoplasmic reticulum but not yet processed in the Golgi, reduced the 85-kDa band to 80-kDa but left the 95-kDa band unaltered (Fig. 2B, Lane 3). Thus, the 95-kDa band represents the maturely glycosylated (Golgi processed) hERG1b isoform, the 85-kDa band represents the core glycosylated, endoplasmic reticulum-retained form, and the 80-kDa band represents the unglycosylated form. To determine whether the mature hERG1b glycoform is expressed on the cell surface, where it could contribute to hERG1 currents, surface proteins were biotinylated prior to cell lysis. Biotinylated proteins were affinity purified with streptavidin beads, blotted, and probed with ERG1-KA antisera. Like hERG1a, only the maturely glycosylated hERG1b (95-kDa) protein band was biotinylated (Fig. 2B, Lane 4), showing hERG1b is expressed on the cell surface in HEK-293 cells. Next we tested the hypothesis that the lower molecular mass signals observed in native cardiac tissue correspond to the ERG1b protein using the ERG1a- and -1b-specific antisera. In Western blots from two separate human ventricular membrane preparations, the ERG1-KA antibody revealed bands at 140, 120, 94 and 83 kDa (Fig. 3A, Lane 1). The 140- and 120-kDa bands are consistent with previous reports from human tissue (6Pond A.L. Scheve B.K. Benedict A.T. Petrecca K. Van Wagoner D.R. Shrier A. Nerbonne J.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 5997-6006Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar) and represent the maturely glycosylated and unglycosylated hERG1a, respectively. The 1b-specific antibody recognized the 94- and 83-kDa bands (Fig. 3A, Lane 2) demonstrating that ERG1b protein is expressed in human ventricle. Erg1b was also observed in canine ventricular tissue. There the ERG1-KA antibody consistently recognized proteins at 160–165 and 90–95 kDa and less consistently at 140–145, 115–125, and 80–85 kDa. Fig. 3 shows that high molecular weight bands at 165 and 140 kDa were recognized by both ERG1-KA and ERG1a antibodies and thus represent ERG1a isoforms (Fig. 3B, Lanes 1 and 2). The ERG1b antibody recognized the bands at 95 and 83 kDa, which were also recognized by ERG1-KA, demonstrating that these bands represent ERG1b isoforms (Fig. 3B, Lanes 1 and 3). These data show conclusively that both ERG1a and -1b proteins are expressed within the ventricle across a range of mammalian species. To determine whether ERG1a and -1b are associated in native tissue, bidirectional co-immunoprecipitations were carried out in four separate canine cardiac membrane preparations. Fig. 4A shows that ERG1a protein was co-immunoprecipitated with the ERG1b-specific antibody and that ERG1b protein was co-immunoprecipitated with the ERG1a-specific antibody. Similar results were obtained from membrane preparations of human myocytes immunoprecipitated with ERG1a-specific antibody (data not shown). These data show ERG1a and -1b proteins associate in mammalian ventricular myocytes in vivo. Consistent with their biochemical association, ERG1a and ERG1b signals localized to the same subcellular compartment using immunocytochemistry. Both the 1a and 1b antibody in fixed, permeabilized canine myocytes revealed a punctate, Z-line-like fluorescence pattern characteristic of a T tubular localization (Fig. 4, B and C) (11He J.Q. Conklin M.W. Foell J.D. Wolff M.R. Haworth R.A. Coronado R. Kamp T.J. Cardiovasc. Res. 2001; 49: 298-307Crossref PubMed Scopus (245) Google Scholar). To characterize ERG1 localization more precisely, we stained myocytes concurrently with ERG1a and myosin binding protein C (MyBP-C) antisera (15Harris S.P. Bartley C.R. Hacker T.A. McDonald K.S. Douglas P.S. Greaser M.L. Powers P.A. Moss R.L. Circ. Res. 2002; 90: 594-601Crossref PubMed Scopus (276) Google Scholar). Three-dimensional images were rendered from a stack of deconvolved two-dimensional immunofluorescent images. MyBP-C signal, in green, appeared as a repeating pattern of doublets separated by regions devoid of fluorescence that span the width of the cell (Fig. 4, D–F). MyBP-C signal localizes to the myosin-containing sarcomere A-band (16Craig R. Offer G. Proc. R. Soc. Lond. B. Biol. Sci. 1976; 192: 451-461Crossref PubMed Scopus (207) Google Scholar); the unstained areas, between doublets, represent M-lines (Fig. 4E). ERG1a fluorescent signal, shown in red, is seen in I-bands adjacent to A-bands (Fig. 4, D and E). Both Z lines and T tubules are located in the I-band (17Huxley A.F. Niedergerke R. Nature. 1954; 173: 971-973Crossref PubMed Scopus (907) Google Scholar). The punctate red ERG1a signal extends in columns from the cell surface to the interior, as expected of a T tubular-restricted protein, where it borders the green MyBP-C signal (Fig. 4E). These data indicate ERG1 signal in canine myocytes is consistent with a T tubular distribution. In this study, we have shown ERG1b protein is produced in mammalian heart. The absence of ERG1b protein in previous studies is likely attributable to a lower affinity of the antibodies employed and/or differential accessibility to the common epitope in ERG1a and -1b. Studies by Finley et al. (7Finley M.R. Li Y. Hua F. Lillich J. Mitchell K.E. Ganta S. Gilmour R.F. Freeman L.C. Am. J. Physiol. 2002; 283: H126-H138Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar) in equine and Rasmussen et al. (18Rasmussen H.B. Moller M. Knaus H.G. Jensen B.S. Olesen S.P. Jorgensen N.K. Am. J. Physiol. 2004; 286: H1300-H1309Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar) in rat mention the appearance of an ∼100-kDa band in some preparations of cardiac membranes. In retrospect, it is reasonable to suggest these signals represented early indications of the ERG1b isoform. We also show ERG1a and -1b proteins are associated in ventricular myocytes. In heterologous systems, ERG1a and -1b expression produces currents with biophysical properties that cannot be explained by the coexistence of two populations of homomeric channels (4London B. Trudeau M.C. Newton K.P. Beyer A.K. Copeland N.G. Gilbert D.J. Jenkins N.A. Satler C.A. Robertson G.A. Circ. Res. 1997; 81: 870-878Crossref PubMed Scopus (246) Google Scholar). The properties of these heteromeric channels more closely resemble those of native IKr channels (19Yang T. Wathen M.S. Felipe A. Tamkun M.M. Snyders D.J. Roden D.M. Circ. Res. 1994; 75: 870-878Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). Localization of ERG1a and -1b to T tubular structures in canine ventricular myocytes is consistent with electron microscopy studies in rat myocytes showing ERG1 protein predominantly localized to the T tubules where it could regulate action potential duration at the site of excitation-contraction coupling (20Brette F. Orchard C. Circ. Res. 2003; 92: 1182-1192Crossref PubMed Scopus (293) Google Scholar). These data strongly suggest native IKr channels, which are localized to T tubules, comprise both ERG1a and -1b subunits. Understanding cardiac IKr physiology and the disease mechanisms of hERG-linked congenital and acquired LQTS necessitates approximating the native state in heterologous systems as closely as possible, minimally requiring coexpression of hERG1a and -1b. In addition, our findings have significant implications for amino-terminal mutations causing LQTS. Approximately 20% of LQTS-2 mutations reside in the amino terminus of hERG1a (pc4.fsm.it:81/cardmoc/hergmut.htm), where they can truncate the protein, alter gating properties, and/or cause trafficking deficiencies (21Chen J.

Because ERG1a and -1b are alternate transcripts produced by the ERG1 gene, mutations in exons encoding the ERG1a amino terminus are not likely to affect the production of wild-type ERG1b from this gene. These findings argue for screening LQTS patients for mutations in the hERG1b-specific exon and assessing the disease mechanism of all mutations in heterologous expression systems in which hERG1a and -1b are co-expressed.

https://openalex.org/W2165554981,"Insig-1 and Insig-2 are closely related proteins of the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) that block proteolytic activation of sterol regulatory element-binding proteins (SREBPs), membrane-bound transcription factors that activate synthesis of cholesterol and fatty acids in animal cells. When cellular cholesterol levels are high, Insig proteins bind to SREBP cleavage-activating protein, retaining it in the ER and preventing it from escorting SREBPs to the site of proteolytic activation in the Golgi complex. Here we report that hypotonic stress reverses the sterol-mediated inhibition of SREBP proteolytic activation by reducing the level of Insig-1 but not Insig-2. The reduction of Insig-1, a protein with a rapid turnover rate, results from a general inhibition of protein synthesis mediated by hypotonic stress. Insig-2 is not affected by hypotonic stress because of its slower turnover rate. Inhibition of protein synthesis by hypotonic shock has not been reported previously. Thapsigargin, an activator of the ER stress response, also inhibits protein synthesis and activates proteolysis of SREBP. Such activation also correlates with the disappearance of Insig-1. The current study demonstrates that animal cells, in response to either hypotonic shock or ER stress, can bypass the cholesterol inhibition of SREBP processing, an effect that is attributable to the rapid turnover of Insig-1.

Goldstein J.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 11041-11048Crossref PubMed Scopus (1093) Google Scholar). After synthesis in ER membranes, SREBPs form a complex with SCAP. When cells are depleted of sterols, SCAP escorts SREBPs from the ER to the Golgi. Within the Golgi two resident proteases, Site-1 protease (S1P) and Site-2 protease (S2P), sequentially cleave the SREBPs through regulated intramembrane proteolysis, release the NH2-terminal fragment of SREBP from the membrane, and allow it to translocate to the nucleus and activate transcription of target genes (2Brown M.S. Ye J. Rawson R.B. Goldstein J.L. Cell. 2000; 100: 391-398Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1141) Google Scholar). When sterols accumulate within cells, either by de novo synthesis or uptake of cholesterol through the LDL receptor, SCAP undergoes a conformational change, which causes the SCAP·SREBP complex to be retained in the ER and thus abrogates SREBP-dependent transcription.Insig-1 and Insig-2 were recently identified as membrane proteins that reside in the ER and play a central role in the regulation of SREBP proteolytic processing (3Yang T.

Goldstein J.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 12753-12758Crossref PubMed Scopus (416) Google Scholar). When cellular cholesterol levels are elevated, SCAP binds to Insigs, an action that blocks the movement of the SREBP·SCAP complex from the ER to the Golgi, thus blocking proteolytic cleavage and transcriptional activation of SREBPs. In cultured cells, the net result of Insig action is to decrease lipid synthesis whenever sterols accumulate to high levels within membranes.Human Insig-1 is composed of 277 amino acids (3Yang T. Espenshade P.J. Wright M.E. Yabe D. Gong Y. Aebersold R. Goldstein J.L. Brown M.S. Cell. 2002; 110: 489-500Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (768) Google Scholar), whereas human Insig-2 contains 225 amino acids (4Yabe D. Brown M.S. Goldstein J.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 12753-12758Crossref PubMed Scopus (416) Google Scholar). Both are deeply embedded in ER membranes through the presence of six membrane-spanning segments (5Feramisco J.D. Goldstein J.L. Brown M.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 279: 8487-8496Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). The proteins exhibit an amino acid identity of 59% with the differences confined mostly to the hydrophilic NH2- and COOH-terminal regions. Insig-1 and Insig-2 are functionally similar in that both cause the ER retention of the SCAP·SREBP complex (3Yang T. Espenshade P.J. Wright M.E. Yabe D. Gong Y. Aebersold R. Goldstein J.L. Brown M.S.

A. 2002; 99: 12753-12758Crossref PubMed Scopus (416) Google Scholar), although their transcription is regulated differently: Insig-1 expression is positively controlled by nuclear SREBPs, while Insig-2 expression is negatively regulated by insulin (6Yabe D.

A. 2003; 100: 3155-3160Crossref PubMed Scopus (246) Google Scholar).In the current study, we report that another difference between Insig-1 and Insig-2 is the turnover rate of Insig-1 is much quicker than that of Insig-2. We show that two cellular perturbations that inhibit general protein synthesis, incubation of cells in hypotonic medium or thapsigargin-induced ER stress (7Harding H.P. Zhang Y. Ron D. Nature. 1999; 397: 271-274Crossref PubMed Scopus (2482) Google Scholar), deplete Insig-1 because of its intrinsically rapid rate of degradation. The depletion of Insig-1 allows SREBP to be proteolytically activated even in the presence of sterols. The results indicate that mammalian cells can rapidly bypass cholesterol-mediated feedback inhibition by decreasing the synthesis of Insig-1.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESMaterials—We obtained sorbitol, thapsigargin, RPMI 1640 amino acid solution, and RPMI 1640 vitamin solution from Sigma; sucrose from Invitrogen; all sterols from Steraloids, Inc.; horseradish peroxidase-conjugated donkey anti-mouse and anti-rabbit IgGs (affinity-purified) from Jackson Immunoresearch Laboratories; and IgG-9E10, a mouse monoclonal antibody against Myc tag, from ATCC.

M19, SRD-12B, and SRD-13A cells were maintained in medium B (medium A supplemented with 5% (v/v) fetal calf serum, 5 μg/ml cholesterol, 1 mm sodium mevalonate, and 20 μm sodium oleate).

Conditions of incubation after transfection are described in the figure legends. After incubation, duplicate dishes of cells were pooled, harvested, and fractionated into membranes and nuclear extracts as described previously (8Sakai J. Duncan E.A. Rawson R.B. Hua X. Brown M.S. Goldstein J.L. Cell. 1996; 85: 1037-1046Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (431) Google Scholar). Thirty μg of membranes and nuclear extracts were subjected to SDS-PAGE and immunoblot analysis. Antibodies were used at the following concentrations: IgG-7D4, a mouse monoclonal antibody against hamster SREBP-2, 5 μg/ml; IgG-R139, a rabbit polyclonal antibody against hamster SCAP, 5 μg/ml; IgG-9E10, a mouse monoclonal antibody against Myc tag, 1 μg/ml; and horseradish peroxidase-conjugated donkey anti-mouse and anti-rabbit IgGs, 0.2 μg/ml. Bound antibodies were visualized by chemiluminescence using the SuperSignal substrate system (Pierce) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Filters were exposed to Kodak X-Omat Blue XB-1 films at room temperature for the indicated time.Real-time PCR—The protocol was identical to that described by Liang et al. (19Liang G. Yang J. Horton J.D. Hammer R.E. Goldstein J.L. Brown M.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 9520-9528Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (518) Google Scholar). Triplicate samples of first-strand cDNA were subjected to real-time PCR quantification using forward and reverse primers for the indicated mRNA with hamster actin as an invariant control. Relative amounts of mRNAs were calculated using the comparative CT method.Pulse-Chase Analysis in CHO-7 Cells—CHO-7 cells stably transfected with Myc-tagged Insig-1 or Insig-2 were incubated in medium A supplemented with 5% FCS as described above. Twenty h after incubation, cells were washed with phosphate-buffered saline and switched to medium D (methionine/cysteine-free Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 5% FCS, 100 units/ml penicillin, and 100 μg/ml streptomycin sulfate). After 1 h at 37 °C, the cells were pulse-labeled with 150 μCi/ml 35S protein labeling mix (PerkinElmer Life Sciences) in 1.5 ml of medium D. After labeling for 1 h, the medium was removed and the cells were washed with phosphate-buffered saline and chased for various times in the indicated medium supplemented with 0.5 mm unlabeled methionine and 1 mm unlabeled cysteine. Following the chase, the medium was removed, and the cells were washed three times with cold phosphate-buffered saline, lysed in 0.7 ml of lysis buffer (25 mm Tris-HCl at pH 7.2 and 0.15 m NaCl) containing 0.1% (v/v) Nonidet P-40 and a protease inhibitor mixture including 10 μg/ml leupeptin, 5 μg/ml pepstatin A, 10 μg/ml aprotinin, and 25 μg/ml N-acetyl-leucinal-leucinal-norleucinal. The lysate was clarified by centrifugation at 20,000 × g for 20 min at 4 °C. The supernatant was transferred to new tubes, and an aliquot (10 μl) was removed for trichloroacetic acid precipitation followed by scintillation counting of the precipitate as described (20Ye J. Wang C. Sumpter Jr., R. Brown M.S. Goldstein J.L. Gale Jr., M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2003; 100: 15865-15870Crossref PubMed Scopus (325) Google Scholar). The remainder of the supernatant was precleared by rotation for 16 h at 4 °C with 50 μl of protein A/G-agarose (Santa Cruz Biotechnology). After centrifugation at 300 × g for 7 min at 4 °C, the supernatant was transferred to a fresh tube, and 15 μg of monoclonal anti-Myc antibody (IgG-9E10) and 50 μl of protein A/G-agarose beads were added and rotated for 2 h at 4 °C. The beads were collected by centrifugation, washed six times (30 min each) in 1 ml of lysis buffer, resuspended in 100 μl of 1× SDS loading buffer, and boiled for 5 min. After centrifugation at 16,000 × g for 3 min at room temperature, the supernatant was transferred to a fresh tube, and aliquots of the immunoprecipitates were subjected to SDS-PAGE. Radiolabeled proteins were transferred to Hybond C-Extra nitrocellulose filters. The filters were dried, exposed to an imaging plate at room temperature for 1 h, and scanned in a Fuji X Bas 1000 phosphorimaging device.RESULTSFig. 1 shows the content of SREBP-2 in membrane and nuclear extracts of CHO-7 cells that were incubated for 2 h in media with varying osmolarities, all containing 5% FCS. When cells were incubated in normal culture medium containing 5% FCS, we observed the full-length precursor form of SREBP-2 in cell membranes but no cleaved mature form in nuclear extracts (Fig. 1, lane 1). This finding indicates that the LDL in FCS provides enough cholesterol to suppress SREBP cleavage. To test whether this suppression can be reversed by hypotonic stress, we created a medium with lower osmolarity by reducing NaCl from 140 to 20 mm (medium C). When cells were incubated in medium C containing 20 mm NaCl plus 5% FCS, we observed the cleaved nuclear form of SREBP-2 in nuclear extracts with a dramatic decrease of the precursor form in the membranes (Fig. 1, lane 2), indicating that SREBP cleavage occurred even though cells were exposed to the same amount of LDL cholesterol. This effect was abolished when we raised the osmolarity by adding more than 50 mm NaCl (Fig. 1, lanes 4–7), 200 mm sorbitol (Fig. 1, lanes 13 and 14), or 100 mm sucrose (Fig. 1, lanes 19–21). Inasmuch as sorbitol and sucrose were effective in restoring inhibition of SREBP-2 cleavage, these data indicate that the stimulation of SREBP-2 cleavage seen in medium C is because of hypotonic stress, not NaCl deprivation. Similar results were obtained when these membranes and nuclear extracts were immunoblotted with an antibody against SREBP-1 (data not shown). We also found that hypotonic stress stimulates SREBP cleavage in three other types of mammalian cells: human embryo kidney cells (HEK-293 cells), SV-40 transformed human fibroblasts (SV589 cells), and human hepatoma cells (Huh-7 cells) (data not shown). The hypotonic shock that we used in our studies is not lethal to cells, as cells continued to grow normally after they were switched back to normal medium.In all studies described below, we define hypotonic medium as medium C containing 20 mm NaCl plus 50 mm sucrose, and isotonic medium as medium C containing 20 mm NaCl plus 200 mm sucrose. As a further control, we studied normal medium, which contains 140 mm NaCl and no sucrose.The data of Fig. 1 demonstrate that hypotonic stress can reverse the suppression of SREBP proteolytic processing mediated by the LDL present in 5% FCS. We then tested whether the effect of hypotonic stress is specific for LDL-derived cholesterol. For this purpose, CHO-7 cells were incubated in 5% lipoprotein-deficient serum supplemented with 25-hydroxyl-cholesterol delivered in ethanol, complexes of cholesterol-·methyl-β-cyclodextrin, or LDL for 16 h prior to and during exposure to the normal, hypotonic, or isotonic medium. As shown in Fig. 2A, all three sterol delivery vehicles effectively suppressed SREBP-2 cleavage in normal (Fig. 2A, lanes 1, 4, and 7) and isotonic medium (Fig. 2A, lanes 3, 6, and 9) but not in hypotonic medium (Fig. 2A, lanes 2, 5, and 8). These data indicate that hypotonic stress reverses sterol-mediated inhibition of SREBP proteolytic processing regardless of whether the sterol is 25-hydroxycholesterol, cholesterol delivered in β-methyl cyclodextrin, or cholesterol delivered in LDL. Inasmuch as these three sources of sterol reach the ER by different mechanisms, these results indicate that hypotonic stress interferes with regulation at a step distal to ER delivery of sterol. This conclusion is supported by the observation that LDL stimulates cholesterol esterification normally in hypotonically shocked cells (data not shown), a finding that implies that LDL cholesterol reaches the ER membrane where esterification takes place.Fig. 2Hypotonic stress reverses the sterol-mediated suppression of SREBP-2 processing. A, CHO-7 cells were set up at 7 × 106 cells/60-mm dish on day 0. On day 1, they were changed to medium A containing 5% lipoprotein-deficient serum with the indicated addition of sterols: 0.1 μg/ml 25-hydroxycholesterol plus 10 μg/ml cholesterol (25-HC/Chol), 50 μm cholesterol in hydroxypropyl-β-cyclodextrin (Chol/CD), or 100 μg of protein/ml of LDL. On day 2, they were changed to normal (N), hypotonic (H), or isotonic (I) medium containing 5% lipoprotein-deficient serum and sterols as indicated above. After incubation for 2 h, cells were harvested and fractionated. Aliquots of membranes and nuclear extracts were subjected to SDS-PAGE and immunoblotting with anti-SREBP-2 antibody. Filters were exposed for 5–10 s. P and N denote precursor and nuclear forms of SREBP-2, respectively. B, CHO-7 cells were set up and treated with normal (white bar), hypotonic (gray bar), and isotonic (black bar) media containing 0.1 μg/ml 25-hydroxycholesterol plus 10 μg/ml cholesterol as described in A. After incubation in indicated medium for 5 h, total RNA was extracted and subjected to real-time PCR quantification with primers for the indicated mRNAs. Results are presented as a proportion of the value in normal medium, which was arbitrarily set at 1. HMG, hydroxymethylglutaryl.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT)To determine whether nuclear SREBP that is released through hypotonic stress is transcriptionally active, we measured mRNA levels of SREBP target genes using real-time PCR. Actin was used as the invariant control. The concentrations of hydroxymethylglutaryl-CoA synthase and hydroxymethylglutaryl-CoA reductase mRNAs, two well characterized SREBP targets, were enhanced 4- and 2-fold, respectively, in hypotonic but not in isotonic medium. The mRNA of Insig-2, a gene that is not subject to SREBP regulation, did not change upon hypotonic stress. The situation for Insig-1, another SREBP downstream gene, was more complicated. Its mRNA transcript was increased in both hypotonic and isotonic media. We do not understand the factor(s) that lead to increased Insig-1 mRNA in the high sucrose isotonic medium. Similar results were obtained in two other experiments performed on different days.We next performed a series of experiments in wild type and mutant CHO cells to determine whether hypotonic stress-induced cleavage of SREBP requires the same proteins that are required for SREBP processing upon sterol deprivation. For this purpose, we transfected the cells with a plasmid (pTK-HSV-SREBP2) encoding human SREBP-2 tagged with two copies of an NH2-terminal epitope derived from an HSV glycoprotein. To avoid artifacts from gross overexpression, the epitope-tagged SREBP-2 is driven by the weak HSV thymidine kinase promoter, which gives a low level of expression that is detectable by immunoblotting with HSV antibody. In wild type CHO-7 cells, the proteolytic cleavage of transfected SREBP-2 was stimulated by hypotonic stress (Fig. 3A). In mutant CHO cells deficient in SCAP (Fig. 3B), no nuclear cleaved form of SREBP-2 was observed when cells were incubated with hypotonic medium (Fig. 3B, lane 3), but co-transfection with SCAP restored the cleavage (Fig. 3B, lane 6). We also observed that the precursor form of SREBP-2 disappeared when these cells were incubated in hypotonic medium, regardless of whether SCAP was present or absent (Fig. 3B, lanes 3 and 6). The significance of this result will be discussed below. In mutant CHO cells deficient in S1P (Fig. 3C), hypotonic stress did not induce SREBP-2 cleavage (Fig. 3C, lane 2). Co-transfection with S1P restored the cleavage of SREBP-2 under hypotonic stress conditions (Fig. 3C, lane 5). In mutant CHO cells deficient in S2P (Fig. 3D), there was no nuclear cleaved form of SREBP-2 with or without hypotonic stress. However, when we transfected a cDNA encoding S2P, we restored the ability of hypotonic stress to induce nuclear SREBP (Fig. 3D, lane 6). Fig. 3D also shows the membrane-bound intermediate form of SREBP that represents the product of site-1 cleavage; it is only seen in cells lacking S2P. This intermediate was present in the cells incubated in normal medium containing FCS, primarily because these cells do not take up cholesterol from LDL in the FCS, due to a lack of LDL receptors, which is attributable to the lack of nuclear SREBPs. The data in Fig. 3, A–D, indicate that hypotonic stress-induced proteolytic processing of SREBP requires SCAP, S1P, and S2P, the same proteins that are required for SREBP processing upon sterol deprivation.Fig. 3Hypotonic stress-induced cleavage of SREBP-2 requires SCAP, S1P, and S2P. A–D, wild type or mutant CHO cells as indicated were set up at 7 × 106 cells/60-mm dish on day 0. On day 1, they were transfected with 2 μg/dish pTK-HSV-SREBP2, 0.5 μg/dish pTK-SCAP, 1 μg/dish pCMV-S1P-Myc, and 1 μg/dish pCMV-S2P-Myc as indicated. The total amount of transfected DNA was adjusted to 3 μg/dish using pcDNA3.1 (Invitrogen). Cells were cultured with medium A containing 5% FCS following transfection. On day 2 cells were switched to normal (N), hypotonic (H), and isotonic (I) media containing 5% FCS. After incubation for 2 h, cells were harvested and fractionated. Aliquots of membranes and nuclear extracts were subjected to SDS-PAGE and immunoblotting with anti-HSV antibody. Filters were exposed for 15 s. P, I, and N denote precursor, intermediate, and nuclear forms of transfected SREBP-2, respectively. The asterisk denotes a cross-reactive band.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT)The above data suggest that the SCAP·SREBP complex is able to move from ER to Golgi despite the presence of ER sterols in cells subjected to hypotonic stress. To determine whether the failure to block SCAP·SREBP movement is attributable to a loss of Insig-1 or Insig-2, we measured the levels of these proteins (as well as SCAP) by immunoblotting. Inasmuch as we lack an antibody sensitive enough to detect endogenous Insigs in CHO cells, we used CHO-7 cells stably transfected with Myc-tagged Insig-1 (CHO/pInsig-1-Myc) (Fig. 4A) or Insig-2 (CHO/pInsig-2-Myc) (Fig. 4B). As shown in Fig. 4A, incubation of CHO/pInsig-1-Myc cells in hypotonic medium stimulated SREBP cleavage as early as 1 h, with the peak induction occurring at 2 h (Fig. 4A, lanes 5–7). A similar increase was not observed in normal or isotonic medium (Fig. 4A, lanes 2–4 and 8–10). The abundance of SCAP and Insig-2 protein did not change throughout the incubation time regardless of which medium was used. Insig-1 protein showed two bands that represent translational products initiated with different methionines (3Yang T. Espenshade P.J. Wright M.E. Yabe D. Gong Y. Aebersold R. Goldstein J.L. Brown M.S. Cell. 2002; 110: 489-500Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (768) Google Scholar). Both bands showed a 50% reduction at 1 h and an 80% reduction at 2 h after switching to hypotonic medium (Fig. 4A, lanes 5 and 6). Such reduction did not occur when cells were incubated in normal and isotonic media. These data raised the possibility that a selective reduction of Insig-1 protein during hypotonic stress may be responsible for stimulation of SREBP proteolytic processing.Fig. 4Insig-1 protein diminishes upon hypotonic stress. CHO-7 cells stably transfected with Myc-tagged Insig-1 (A) or Insig-2 (B) were set up at 7 × 106 cells/60-mm dish on day 0. They were changed to medium A containing 5% FCS on day 1. On day 2, cells were switched to normal (N), hypotonic (H), and isotonic (I) media containing 5% FCS for the indicated time. Cells were then harvested and fractionated.

https://openalex.org/W1994250242,"Hypoxia-inducible factor (HIF) is a heterodimeric transcription factor that directs a broad range of cellular responses to hypoxia. Recent studies have defined a set of 2-oxoglutarate and Fe(II)-dependent dioxygenases that modify HIF-α subunits by prolyl and asparaginyl hydroxylation. These processes potentially provide a dual system of control, down-regulating both HIF-α stability and transcriptional activity. Although genetic analyses in both primitive organisms and mammalian cells have demonstrated a critical role for the prolyl hydroxylase pathway in the regulation of HIF, analogous studies have not been performed on the HIF asparaginyl hydroxylase pathway, and its role in directing the expression of endogenous HIF transcriptional targets has not yet been clearly defined. Here we demonstrate, using small interfering RNA-mediated FIH suppression and controlled overexpression by a doxycycline-inducible system, that alterations in FIH expression in both directions have reciprocal effects on the expression of a range of HIF target genes. These effects were observed in normoxic and severely hypoxic cells but not anoxic cells. Evidence for FIH activity in severely hypoxic cells contrasted with results for the prolyl hydroxylase PHD2, suggesting that these enzymes display different oxygen dependence in vivo, with PHD2 requiring higher levels of oxygen for biological activity. Our results demonstrate an important physiological role for FIH in regulating HIF-dependent target genes over a wide range of oxygen tensions and indicate that inhibition of FIH has the potential to augment HIF target gene expression even in severe hypoxia.

To address this, we first characterized FIH protein levels in different human tissue culture cell lines and used these data to guide functional studies with siRNA-based knockdown and controlled overexpression of FIH in target cells. We show that FIH protein is widely expressed, that it has important nonredundant effects on the expression of a range of HIF transcriptional targets, and that biologically significant FIH activity is observed in vivo even in severe hypoxia. Cell Culture—Cell lines were obtained from ATCC (American Type Culture Collection) (Manassas, VA), ECACC (European Collection of Animal Cell Cultures), or National Institutes of Health, NCI and cultured according to their recommendations. Stable transfectants were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% Tet system-approved fetal bovine serum (Clontech), penicillin G (50 IU/ml), streptomycin (50 μg/ml) (Invitrogen), l-glutamine (2 mm) (Sigma), blasticidin S (5 μg/ml) (Invitrogen) and maintained in hygromycin B (200 μg/ml; Roche Applied Science) or G418 (1 mg/ml Geneticin, Invitrogen). Hypoxic/anoxic incubations of cells were performed in an Invivo2 400 hypoxic work station (Ruskinn Technologies).

Two BALB/c mice were immunized with 50 μg of the purified immunogen in complete Freund's adjuvant followed by four further immunizations in phosphate-buffered saline at 10-day intervals until appropriate reactivity was observed with immunoblots of fih/pcDNA3-transfected COS cell extract. Fusion of mouse splenocytes with myeloma cells was performed using standard techniques. Hybridoma supernatants were screened by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay against purified FIH immunogen and by immunolabeling of COS cells transfected with fih/pcDNA3. One clone (MoAb162C) provided the strongest signal and was used in the majority of experiments. For confirmation of signal identity, additional experiments were performed with a second clone MoAb62B, which also gave a specific anti-FIH signal in COS cell transfectants. For immunoblot analysis, MoAb162C supernatant was diluted 1:750 and MoAb62B supernatant was diluted 1:50 in semi-skimmed milk. siRNA Preparation and Transient Transfection—A total of eight siRNA duplexes targeting FIH were designed according to previously described sequence determinants (21Elbashir S.M. Harborth J. Lendeckel W. Yalcin A. Weber K. Tusche T. Nature. 2001; 411: 494-498Crossref PubMed Scopus (8160) Google Scholar), prepared by in vitro transcription using the Silencer™ siRNA construction kit (Ambion), and tested for efficiency in suppression of FIH. Two sequences (sequence motif AA19; nucleotides 86–106 (target 1) and 172–192 (target 2) relative to the start codon; GenBank™ accession number NM_017902) were selected and used for further studies. In addition, two chemically synthesized and PAGE-purified siRNA duplexes were obtained from Ambion (sequence motif NA19; nucleotides 91–111 (target F1) and 160–180 (target F2) relative to the start codon; GenBank™ accession number NM_017902). All four siRNA duplexes achieved good suppression of FIH; F1 and F2 were used in the majority of the experiments. The sequence targeting HIF-1α (accession number NM_001530) corresponds to nucleotides 1257–1277 of the coding region (22Sowter H.M. Raval R.R. Moore J.W. Ratcliffe P.J. Harris A.L.

Annealing of siRNA was performed according to the manufacturer's instructions. 24 h after seeding the cells in antibiotic-free medium, transfection of siRNAs was carried out at a final concentration of 2.5–5 nm (in vitro transcribed siRNA) or 10 nm (chemically synthesized siRNA) using Oligofectamine reagent (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Cells were treated with three 24-h spaced applications of siRNA and assayed 72 h after the first transfection. RNA Analysis—Total RNA was extracted using RNAzol (Biogenesis, Poole, UK). Ribonuclease protection assays (RPA) were performed as described previously (24Maxwell P.H. Wiesener M.S. Chang G.-W. Clifford S.C. Vaux E.C. Cockman M.E. Wykoff C.C. Pugh C.W. Maher E.R.

To generate the template for FIH, a PstI/NsiI fragment (215 bp; nucleotides 436–650; accession number NM_017902) was subcloned into pSP72 (Promega) and transcribed using SP6. Templates for U6 small nuclear RNA (U6 SnRNA), glucose transporter 1 (GLUT1), vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), lactate dehydrogenase A (LDH-A), carbonic anhydrase 9 (CA9), and prolyl hydroxylase domain 2 (PHD2) were used as described previously (3Epstein A.C.R.

Immunofluorescence Microscopy—Cells grown on lysine-coated glass slides (polylysine; BDH, Poole, UK) were washed in ice-cold phosphatebuffered saline and fixed in methanol/acetone (1:1) at –20 °C for 10 min and air-dried. Slides were blocked with 3% bovine serum albumin/phosphate-buffered saline for 10 min followed by incubation with MoAb162C hybridoma supernatant or mouse anti-human HIF-1α (BD Transduction Laboratories, clone 54, 1:50) for 2 h. After washing in phosphate-buffered saline, cells were incubated for 1 h with Alexa Fluor 488 goat anti-mouse IgG (1:400; Molecular Probes), and nuclei were stained with propidium iodide/Vectashield (Vector Laboratories). Immunostained cells were analyzed using an MRC-1024 laser scanning confocal imaging system (Bio-Rad) with ×60 oil immersion objective lens. Images were captured and assessed using Bio-Rad Laser-Sharp2000 software. Expression of FIH in Human Tissue Culture Cell Lines— Immunoblot analysis of whole cell extracts using MoAb162C revealed FIH protein to be widely expressed at similar levels across a wide range of cell types (Fig. 1A). Since levels of HIF prolyl hydroxylases are modulated by hypoxia through the action of HIF (23Berra E. Benizri E. Ginouves A. Volmat V. Roux D. Pouyssegur J.

Chem. 2003; 278: 48690-48695Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar), we tested whether FIH protein levels are altered by hypoxia. Whole cell extracts from HeLa, Hep3B, U-2OS, MCF-7, and PC3 were prepared following parallel normoxic and hypoxic (0.2% oxygen) incubations for 16 h (Fig. 1B). FIH protein expression was unaffected by hypoxia, whereas as expected, HIF-1α was strongly induced. Similarly, exposure of Hep3B and U-2OS cells to cobaltous ions (CoCl2, 150 μm), the iron chelator desferrioxamine mesylate (100 μm), and dimethyloxalylglycine (1 mm), a competitive inhibitor of 2-oxoglutarate-dependent dioxygenases, for 6 h had no effect on FIH protein levels despite the striking induction of HIF-1α (data not shown). Immunohistochemical analysis of U-2OS cells using MoAb162C revealed a predominant cytoplasmic location for FIH that was not altered when cells were incubated in 0.2% oxygen for 6 h (Fig. 1C). Similar results were obtained by immunoblot analysis of nuclear and cytoplasmic extracts from U-2OS, Hep3B, and HeLa cells exposed to 21 and 0.2% oxygen for 6 h (Fig. 1D and data not shown). Taken together, these experiments demonstrate that FIH is widely expressed and thus potentially available for regulation of HIF activity across a broad range of cells and culture conditions. Silencing of FIH by RNA Interference Up-regulates HIF-dependent Target Gene Expression in Normoxia—To define the role of FIH in regulating endogenous HIF-dependent target gene expression, we used an siRNA approach to suppress FIH expression using two independent double-stranded oligonucleotide sequences. To control for nonspecific effects of the siRNA transfection, two irrelevant siRNA duplexes were used, and as a further control, in certain experiments, mock transfections were performed in which cells were exposed to the transfection reagent alone. Following preliminary experiments to optimize dose and transfection protocol, experiments were performed using three applications of the siRNA spaced by 24 h. Specific silencing of FIH in U-2OS cells was documented by immunofluorescence microscopy and immunoblotting (Fig. 2A). Successful silencing reciprocally confirmed that the immunoreactive signals detected by MoAb162C in immunofluorescence and immunoblot analysis correspond to FIH. To evaluate whether endogenous FIH exerts tonic inhibitory effects on HIF target gene expression in normoxic cells (21% oxygen), we transfected HeLa, Hep3B, and U-2OS cells with FIH-specific or irrelevant control siRNA duplexes (Fig. 2B). In all three cell lines, very substantial suppression of FIH was achieved. The low levels of HIF-1α protein in these normoxic cells were unaffected by FIH suppression. In contrast, HIF transcriptional target gene expression was clearly induced. The highly inducible HIF target CA9 was up-regulated by FIH suppression in all cells, whereas GLUT1 was up-regulated in both HeLa and U-2OS but remained below the limit of detection in Hep3B cells. This suggested that the low levels of HIF-1α in normoxic cells are potentially active and that this transcriptional activity is normally suppressed by FIH. Because of the importance of PHD2 in regulating HIF-1α in normoxia (23Berra E. Benizri E. Ginouves A. Volmat V. Roux D. Pouyssegur J. EMBO J. 2003; 22: 4082-4090Crossref PubMed Scopus (1092) Google Scholar), we sought to compare the effects of FIH suppression on HIF target genes with those of PHD2 siRNA (P2)-transfected U-2OS cells. As shown in Fig. 2B (right panel), the effect of FIH suppression on CA9 was relatively small when compared with the up-regulation of CA9 in PHD2 siRNA-transfected cells. Interestingly, the difference between GLUT1 induction in FIH and PHD2 knock-down cells was less striking, which might indicate that FIH has gene-specific effects or other targets that might be responsible for differential effects. Both CA9 and GLUT1 are dominantly responsive to HIF-1α in the cells under study (30Bruick R.K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 9082-9087Crossref PubMed Scopus (664) Google Scholar). 2R. R. Raval and P. J. Ratcliffe, unpublished observation. Therefore, to confirm that the observed up-regulation of GLUT1 and CA9 expression is mediated by the HIF system, U-2OS cells were co-transfected with FIH-specific or control siRNA either in the absence (additional irrelevant control) or in the presence of specific HIF-1α-targeting siRNA duplexes. As shown in Fig. 2C, lanes 1–4, HIF-1α was effectively suppressed, and this abolished up-regulation of GLUT1 and CA9 protein expression by FIH knock-down. To further confirm that the effects of FIH suppression were mediated by HIF, we tested the effects of FIH RNAi on HIF target gene expression in a U-2OS stable transfectant (c29) that inducibly overexpresses HIF-1α using a doxycycline-dependent “Tet-on” expression system (Fig. 2C, lanes 5–8). Following induction of HIF-1α by doxycycline treatment of normoxic c29 cells, both GLUT1 and CA9 were moderately up-regulated, with the siRNA-based suppression of FIH resulting in striking further induction. Taken together, these results demonstrate that endogenous FIH exerts a tonic inhibitory effect on the expression of at least two HIF target genes under standard tissue culture conditions and that this effect is substantial even in normoxic cells expressing very low steady-state levels of HIF-1α. FIH Modulates HIF Activity in Vivo over a Range of Oxygen Tensions—We next investigated the effects of FIH suppression on the induction of HIF target gene expression by hypoxia. To analyze effects on progressive induction of the HIF transcriptional response by graded hypoxia, Hep3B and U-2OS cells were transfected with FIH-specific or control siRNA duplexes and then incubated for 16 h in hypoxic atmospheres ranging from 7.5% oxygen down to 1% oxygen. Whole cell extracts were analyzed by immunoblotting for CA9 and GLUT1, and results are shown in Fig. 3A. Although induction by FIH suppression was modest in relation to the total amplitude of induction by hypoxia, CA9 and GLUT1 protein levels were clearly up-regulated by FIH suppression over the entire range of oxygen tensions from 21 to 1% oxygen. These results suggested that biologically significant FIH activity persists even in quite severe hypoxia. However, since transfections with siRNA were performed in normoxia prior to the 16-h hypoxic exposure, we considered it possible that the observed changes in target gene expression might simply reflect early changes in FIH, preceding hypoxic equilibration. To analyze this and also to determine the effects on additional HIF target genes, we therefore performed further experiments in which cells were equilibrated in hypoxia prior to the application of siRNA. In these experiments, U-2OS cells were exposed to 1% oxygen for 4 h prior to a transfection protocol involving three applications of siRNA spaced over a 48-h period followed by harvest after a total of 72 h in hypoxia. Total RNA was prepared, and mRNAs encoding CA9, GLUT1, LDH-A, and VEGF were analyzed by RNase protection (Fig. 3B). Up-regulation of these HIF target genes was clearly observed following FIH suppression, effects being somewhat variable and greater on CA9, GLUT1, and LDH-A mRNAs than on VEGF mRNA. These results in pre-equilibrated cells confirm that endogenous FIH is also able to limit transcriptional effects of HIF even at low (1%) oxygen availability. Modest Increase in FIH Expression Down-regulates HIF Target Gene Expression in Severe Hypoxia—To further explore the role of FIH in regulation of HIF target gene expression, we next generated stably transfected U-2OS cells capable of generating modest controlled increments in FIH expression using a doxycycline-dependent expression system.

RUNX2, a member of the Ig-loop family of transcription factors is expressed in vascular endothelial cells (EC) and regulates EC migration, invasion, and proliferation. Here we show that IGF-1 and its receptor regulate post-translational changes in RUNX2 to activate DNA binding in proliferating EC. The phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K) inhibitor, LY294002, reduced both basal and IGF-1-stimulated RUNX2 DNA binding activity in the absence of changes in RUNX2 protein as did the overexpression of the phosphatidylinositol 3-phosphate phosphatase, confirming that PI3K signaling mediates RUNX2 activation. IGF-1 increased ERK1/2 activation, which was abrogated by the inhibition of PI3K, thus linking these two pathways in EC. Treatment with U0126, which inhibits ERK1/2 activation, reduced IGF-1-stimulated RUNX2 DNA binding without affecting RUNX2 protein levels. Overexpression of constitutively active MKK1 increased RUNX2 DNA binding and phosphorylation. No additive effects of PI3K or ERK inhibitors on DNA binding were evident. Surprisingly, these IGF-1-mediated effects on RUNX2 were not regulated by Akt phosphorylation, a common downstream target of PI3K, as determined by pharmacological or genetic inhibition. However, an inhibitor of the p21-activated protein kinase-1, glutathione S-transferase-Pak1-(83–149), inhibited both basal and IGF-1-stimulated RUNX2 DNA binding, suggesting that Pak1 mediates IGF-1 signaling to increase RUNX2 activity. These results indicate that the angiogenic growth factor, IGF-1, can regulate RUNX2 DNA binding through sequential activation of the PI3K/Pak1 and ERK1/2 signaling cascade.

Overexpression of constitutively active MKK1 increased RUNX2 DNA binding and phosphorylation. No additive effects of PI3K or ERK inhibitors on DNA binding were evident. Surprisingly, these IGF-1-mediated effects on RUNX2 were not regulated by Akt phosphorylation, a common downstream target of PI3K, as determined by pharmacological or genetic inhibition. However, an inhibitor of the p21-activated protein kinase-1, glutathione S-transferase-Pak1-(83–149), inhibited both basal and IGF-1-stimulated RUNX2 DNA binding, suggesting that Pak1 mediates IGF-1 signaling to increase RUNX2 activity. These results indicate that the angiogenic growth factor, IGF-1, can regulate RUNX2 DNA binding through sequential activation of the PI3K/Pak1 and ERK1/2 signaling cascade. RUNX2 is a member of the family of transcription factor genes (RUNX) that contains a conserved Runt DNA-binding domain (1Stein G.S. Lian J.B. van Wijnen A.J. Stein J.L. Montecino M. Javed A.

Many matrix gene promoters in osteoblasts and chondrocytes are activated by RUNX2, including osteocalcin, type I collagen-α1 and α2 chains, bone sialoprotein, osteopontin (8Kern B. Shen J. Starbuck M. Karsenty G. J. Biol.

Chen Y. Garcia-Rojas X. Lee B. J. Cell Biol. 2003; 162: 833-842Crossref PubMed Scopus (257) Google Scholar). RUNX2 has been shown to mediate the expression of vascular endothelial growth factor in hypertrophic chondrocytes that regulates angiogenesis during bone formation (10Zelzer E. Glotzer D.J.

Vitolo M. Passaniti A. Cancer Res. 2001; 61: 4994-5001PubMed Google Scholar). Although endothelium is a tissue that expresses RUNX genes, it is not clear what the transcriptional targets are in EC. The expression of a dominant-negative Runt DNA-binding domain inhibited EC migration and invasion and expression of the genes encoding the proteolytic enzymes urokinase plasminogen activator and membrane-type matrix metalloproteinase-1, which mediate cell invasion (12Sun L. Vitolo M. Passaniti A. Cancer Res. 2001; 61: 4994-5001PubMed Google Scholar). RUNX2 expression in EC and during angiogenesis suggests that it may be a contributing factor for tumorigenesis. However, RUNX2 may also directly promote the malignant phenotype. RUNX2 cooperates with c-Myc to enhance lymphomagenesis in transgenic mice (14Vaillant F. Blyth K. Terry A. Bell M. Cameron E.R. Neil J. Stewart M. Oncogene. 1999; 18: 7124-7134Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). Endogenous RUNX2 in malignant breast cancer cells was found to regulate bone sialoprotein expression (15Barnes G.L. Javed A. Waller S.M. Kamal M.H. Hebert K.E. Hassan M.Q. Bellahcene A.

Extracellular factors, such as transforming growth factor-β, extracellular matrix (ECM), fibroblast growth factor-2 (FGF-2), bone morphogenic protein, retinoids, and vitamin D3 have been shown to activate, whereas tumor necrosis factor-α has been shown to reduce RUNX2 expression and/or activity (20Franceschi R.T.

Physiol. 2000; 184: 341-350Crossref PubMed Scopus (238) Google Scholar). RUNX2 DNA binding activity is enhanced by interaction with the α2 integrin (23Xiao G. Wang D. Benson M.D. Karsenty G. Franceschi R.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 32988-32994Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (335) Google Scholar) or treatment with the potent angiogenic factor, FGF-2 (24LaVallee T.M.

Med. 1995; 1: 27-31Crossref PubMed Scopus (7235) Google Scholar). FGF-2-stimulated angiogenesis is synergistic with the αVβ3 integrin pathway (26Friedlander M. Brooks P.C. Shaffer R.W. Kincaid C.M. Varner J.A. Cheresh D.A. Science. 1995; 270: 1500-1502Crossref PubMed Scopus (1225) Google Scholar). FGF-2 can also regulate skeletal development (27Coffin J.D. Florkiewicz R.Z. Neumann J.

Chem. 1996; 271: 7508-7515Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). FGF-2 increased while treatment with the MEK/ERK inhibitor, U0126, prevented RUNX2 phosphorylation in pre-osteoblast cells (30Xiao G. Jiang D. Gopalakrishnan R. Franceschi R.T. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 36181-36187Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (331) Google Scholar). RUNX2-mediated osteocalcin promoter activation was also increased by FGF-2 but inhibited by U0126, suggesting that an ERK pathway was responsible for transcriptional activity. This FGF-2 activated response was synergistically enhanced by the protein kinase A pathway after forskolin treatment (31Selvamurugan N. Pulumati M.R. Tyson D.R. Partridge N.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 5037-5042Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (174) Google Scholar). Insulin-like growth factor-1 (IGF-1) is part of a family of related growth factors including IGF-2 and insulin that interact with specific receptor tyrosine kinases (IGF-1R and IGF-2R) that transmit intracellular signals to regulate normal development and cellular function (32Baker J. Liu J.P. Robertson E.J. Efstratiadis A. Cell. 1993; 75: 73-82Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2072) Google Scholar). IGF-1 also regulates specific hormone receptor and cytokine genes that are important in postnatal growth, differentiation, and angiogenesis. Elevated IGF-1 levels appear to be associated with prostate cancer and IGF-1 regulates the growth of several breast cancer cells (33Manes S. Llorente M. Lacalle R.A. Gomez-Mouton C. Kremer L. Mira E.

Carcinog. 2000; 27: 10-17Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). Signal transduction cross-talk has been described for many receptor-regulated pathways (35Chang F. Steelman L.S. Lee J.T. Shelton J.G. Navolanic P.M. Blalock W.L. Franklin R.A. McCubrey J.A. Leukemia. 2003; 17: 1263-1293Crossref PubMed Scopus (603) Google Scholar). IGF-1 is a potent growth factor for many cells and an angiogenic factor that can stimulate EC proliferation and differentiation through selective cross-talk between the αVβ5 integrin and protein kinase C signaling pathways (36Brooks P.C. Klemke R.L. Schon S. Lewis J.M. Schwartz M.A. Cheresh D.A. J. Clin. Investig. 1997; 99: 1390-1398Crossref PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar). IGF-1 activates cell growth and survival through the phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K) and Akt pathway. IGF-1 treatment also leads to mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) kinase (MKK) and ERK1/2 activation (37Lopaczynski W. Acta Biochim. Pol. 1999; 46: 51-60Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar, 38Shelton J.G. Steelman L.S. White E.R. McCubrey J.A. Cell Cycle. 2004; 3: 372-379PubMed Google Scholar). The p21-activated kinase-1 (Pak1) in cooperation with Ras/Raf may serve as a link between PI3K and ERK signaling pathways (39Jaffer Z.M. Chernoff J. Int. J. Biochem. Cell Biol. 2002; 34: 713-717Crossref PubMed Scopus (318) Google Scholar). Pak1 is associated with chromatin during the G2/M phase of the cell cycle (40Li F. Adam L. Vadlamudi R.K. Zhou H. Sen S. Chernoff J. Mandal M. Kumar R. EMBO Rep. 2002; 3: 767-773Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar) and has a role in transcriptional repression (41Barnes C.J. Vadlamudi R.K. Mishra S.K.

Oncogene. 2002; 21: 2236-2244Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar). We showed previously that angiogenesis and RUNX2 mRNA and protein expression were stimulated by treatment with the angiogenic factor IGF-1 in a human bone marrow EC line (HBME-1) with an IC50 of 14 pm (12Sun L. Vitolo M. Passaniti A. Cancer Res. 2001; 61: 4994-5001PubMed Google Scholar). RUNX2 expression was associated with a dose-dependent increase in EC tube formation on extracellular matrix, which could be inhibited by incubation with neutralizing IGF-1 receptor antibodies. Although these results show that IGF-1 may increase RUNX2 expression in EC (12Sun L. Vitolo M. Passaniti A. Cancer Res. 2001; 61: 4994-5001PubMed Google Scholar), the specific components of the IGF-1 signaling pathway that regulate RUNX2 DNA binding activity (in the absence of changes in RNA and protein expression) have not been characterized. From the current studies, it now appears that the PI3K signaling pathway may mediate both IGF-1-dependent synthesis of RUNX2 and posttranslational regulation of RUNX2 DNA binding activity through an Akt-independent pathway requiring ERK1/2. Reagents—Recombinant human IGF-1 and neutralizing antibody for IGF-1 receptor were purchased from R&D Systems (Minneapolis, MN). LY294002 and U0126 were from Calbiochem. Each was prepared as a 20 mm stock solution in dimethyl sulfoxide and stored at –20 °C. The Akt-specific inhibitor (SH5) was from Alexis Biochemicals (San Diego, CA). Actinomycin D and cycloheximide were from Calbiochem. Anti-AML3 (RUNX2) polyclonal antibody was obtained from Oncogene Research Product (Cambridge, MA), and total and phospho-Akt antibodies were from Cell Signaling Technology (Beverly, MA). Total phospho-ERK1/2 antibodies were from Santa Cruz Biotechnology (Santa Cruz, CA). Akt dominant-negative (DN) and constitutively active (CA) expression vectors and the CA-MKK1 vector were prepared in our laboratories. PTEN wild-type and mutant vectors were from Dr. Yun Qiu (Department of Pharmacology, University of Maryland). FLAG-M2 monoclonal and γ-tubulin antibodies were from Sigma. Anti-GST antibody was from Zymed Laboratories Inc. (San Francisco, CA). Cell Culture and Treatment—HBME cells (46Lehr J.E. Pienta K.J. J. Natl. Cancer Inst. 1998; 90: 118-123Crossref PubMed Scopus (190) Google Scholar), a gift from Dr. Kenneth Pienta (Comprehensive Cancer Center, University of Michigan), and HEK293 cells (from Dr. Robert Fenton, University of Maryland) were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum, 100 units/ml penicillin, and 100 μg/ml streptomycin from Invitrogen at 37 °C in a humidified atmosphere with 5% CO2. HBME cells were treated with either IGF-1 or with inhibitors of the PI3K, Akt, or ERK signaling pathways as indicated in the figure legends. For experiments in which IGF-1 activation of RUNX2 was examined, HBME cells were harvested with trypsin and replated for 16 h in complete medium prior to IGF-1 treatment. Under these conditions, RUNX2 levels were generally low prior to IGF-1 treatment. In some cases, cells were serum-starved for 24 h after replating prior to IGF-1 treatment. For inhibition experiments, HBME cells were cultured for 3 days after replating until 90% confluent (subconfluent cells). Under these conditions, RUNX2 levels were generally high prior to inhibition with LY294002, U0126, or SH5. Transient Transfection—All of the cell lines were plated on 35-mm dishes at a density of 5 × 105 cells/cm2. After 24 h, the transfection of HBME or HEK293 cells was carried out in complete medium according to the manufacturer's protocols with Mirus TransIT LT1 reagent from Mirus Corporation (Madison, WI). Two days after transfection, the cells were harvested and analyzed for protein expression by Western blotting using specific antibodies. Nuclear Protein Isolation—For electrophoretic mobility shift assay (EMSA) assays, cells were washed with chilled phosphate-buffered saline and centrifuged at 800 × g for 5 min at 4 °C and then treated with hypotonic lysis buffer (10 mm Tris, 10 mm NaCl, 3 mm MgCl2, 0.5% Nonidet P-40) for 30 min at 4 °C. Nuclei were centrifuged at 14,000 rpm for 30 min at 4 °C, and nuclear proteins were extracted with buffer containing 10 mm HEPES, 20% glycerol, 800 mm KCl, 1.5 mm MgCl2, and 0.2 mm EDTA and diluted with hypotonic buffer (1:1, v:v) prior to use. Protein concentrations were determined by the Bradford assay using the Bio-Rad reagent. All of the buffers contained a mixture of protease and phosphatase inhibitors consisting of 2 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 5 μg/ml aprotonin, 1 mm EGTA, 10 mm NaF, 1 mm sodium pyrophosphate, and 1 mm sodium orthovanadate. For subcellular fractionation of RUNX2, hypotonic low salt buffer containing 0.5% Nonidet P-40 was used to solubilize RUNX2 from the cytosolic and nucleoplasmic compartments, high salt buffer (0.8 m KCl) was used to remove RUNX2 bound to nucleic acid, and a final resuspension of salt-insoluble nuclear pellet in 2× SDS sample buffer was used to extract RUNX2 associated with the chromatin fraction (47Westendorf J.J. Zaidi S.K. Cascino J.E. Kahler R. van Wijnen A.J. Lian J.B. Yoshida M. Stein G.S. Li X. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2002; 22: 7982-7992Crossref PubMed Scopus (282) Google Scholar). EMSA—5 μg of nuclear extract protein were incubated for 20 min at room temperature with a 32P-labeled oligonucleotide derived from the human osteocalcin promoter (from –141 to –165) and containing the human Runx2 consensus sequence (shown in boldface): 5′-CGTATTAACCACAATACTCG-3′ and 3′-AATTGGTGTTATGAGCATGC-5′. The double-stranded RUNX2 probe was end-labeled using [α-32P]-dATP, a dNTP mixture, and Klenow enzyme (New England Biolab number M0210S) and purified according to standard protocols from Amersham Biosciences. DNA-protein complexes were resolved on 6% Tris borate-EDTA polyacrylamide gels (Invitrogen). Gels were dried and exposed to x-ray film at –80 °C with an intensifying screen. For supershift experiments, nuclear extracts were incubated with RUNX2-specific antibody in binding buffer for 45 min at room temperature before 32P-labeled oligonucleotide was added to the binding mixture. Western Blotting—Heated denatured nuclear proteins were resolved by SDS-PAGE and then transferred to a polyvinylidene difluoride membrane using the Novex-NuPAGE system from Invitrogen. Membranes were blocked with 5% nonfat milk for 1 h at room temperature and subsequently incubated overnight with primary antibodies. Signals were detected using a horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibody and an enhanced chemiluminescence (ECL) detection kit from Amersham Biosciences. Data Analysis—The densitometry analysis to quantify RUNX2 DNA binding activity was performed using the NIH Image analysis program. Arbitrary densitometric units were normalized with total protein levels in each nuclear extract. Results shown are representative of at least three experiments with essentially similar results. Student's t test was used to determine significant differences. RUNX2 protein is expressed in several EC including HBME, human dermal microvascular EC, and human lung microvascular EC (11Namba K.

To determine whether EC RUNX2 protein could actively bind DNA, endogenous RUNX2 DNA binding activity assays (EMSA) were performed. Nuclear extracts from HBME cells were incubated with the cognate RUNX-binding oligonucleotide from the osteocalcin promoter (3Ducy P. Zhang R. Geoffroy V. Ridall A.L. Karsenty G. Cell. 1997; 89: 747-754Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3668) Google Scholar), and the shifted complexes were resolved on Tris borate-EDTA DNA retardation gels (Fig. 1A). A major binding complex (arrow) was evident, which was competed by specific cold oligonucleotide, but not the nonspecific oligonucleotide containing a STAT-binding site. RUNX2 was present in the binding complex as confirmed with RUNX2-specific antibody (Fig. 1B), which induced a supershifted complex. Several control antibodies, including anti-γ-tubulin antibody, did not affect the RUNX2 gel shift, whereas an antibody to corebinding factor β, a RUNX2-binding cofactor, slightly altered the shifted complex with evidence of a supershift. We showed previously that IGF-1 increases the expression of RUNX2 mRNA and protein (12Sun L. Vitolo M. Passaniti A. Cancer Res. 2001; 61: 4994-5001PubMed Google Scholar). IGF-1 stimulation of RUNX2 DNA binding was also conserved in several other cells, including the human breast cancer SUM159 and rat myoblast C2C12 cells (Fig. 1C). IGF-1 treatment increased RUNX2 DNA binding activity in HBME cells up to 10-fold relative to untreated cells (Fig. 2A). Maximum IGF-1 activation was observed between 10 and 20 ng/ml. These doses of IGF-1 are comparable to those used previously (12Sun L. Vitolo M. Passaniti A. Cancer Res. 2001; 61: 4994-5001PubMed Google Scholar) with a similar EC50 of 15 pm. Protein levels of RUNX2 also increased with a concomitant increase in phosphorylated Akt (pAkt), which is a downstream component activated by IGF-1 and used here as a positive control for IGF-1 treatment. The presence of a lower molecular weight band of RUNX2 has been described before by our laboratory (13Sun L. Vitolo M. Qiao M. Anglin I. Passaniti A. Oncogene. 2004; 23: 4722-4734Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar) and is the result of an alternative splicing event (13Sun L. Vitolo M. Qiao M. Anglin I. Passaniti A. Oncogene. 2004; 23: 4722-4734Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar, 49Geoffroy V. Corral D.A. Zhou L. Lee B. Karsenty G. Mamm.

The increase in RUNX2 activity was also time-dependent with up to 12-fold increase evident after 45 min in the presence of 20 ng/ml IGF-1 (Fig. 2B). The induction of RUNX2 activity was not dependent on new transcription or protein synthesis, because the presence of cycloheximide (Fig. 2B, panel c) or actinomycin D (data not shown) did not inhibit IGF-1-induced RUNX2 protein or DNA binding. Interestingly, in the absence of IGF-1, low levels of RUNX2 protein were present in high salt-extracted nuclear fractions (N), whereas increased RUNX2 was evident after IGF-1 treatment (Fig. 2C). Conversely, chromatin-associated RUNX2 (Chr) declined after IGF-1 treatment, suggesting an IGF-1-mediated redistribution of nuclear RUNX2. To test the hypothesis that the IGF-1-stimulated increase in RUNX2 DNA binding was regulated by IGF-1R, EC were treated with neutralizing IGF-1R antibody in the presence or absence of IGF-1 for 30 min. Nuclear extracts were prepared, and DNA binding activity was measured. Results indicate that neutralization of IGF-1R modestly inhibited the RUNX2 DNA binding induced by IGF-1 (Fig. 2C). RUNX2 protein levels were also lower in cells treated with neutralizing IGF-1R antibody. This is consistent with previous data showing that RUNX2 regulation of EC tube formation was inhibited by IGF-1R antibodies (12Sun L. Vitolo M. Passaniti A. Cancer Res. 2001; 61: 4994-5001PubMed Google Scholar). An early event in IGF-1 signaling is the activation of the PI3K pathway. To determine whether PI3K signaling could regulate RUNX2 activity, HBME cells were treated with the PI3K inhibitor LY294002 for 24 h and RUNX2 DNA binding and protein levels were measured (Fig. 3A). Inhibition of PI3K resulted in a dose-dependent inhibition of RUNX2 activity with 30, 50, and 90% inhibition at LY294002 concentrations of 5, 10, and 20 μm, respectively. RUNX2 protein levels were also reduced, as was pAkt. However, total Akt levels were unchanged. Inhibition with LY294002 was time-dependent (Fig. 3B) with ∼40% inhibition observed as early as 4 h with little change in RUNX2 protein levels. Longer treatment times resulted in complete inhibition of RUNX2 protein expression in the"

They cooperate with the Hsp70 chaperones in reactivation of thermally aggregated protein substrates. We investigated the initial events of the disaggregation reaction in real time using denatured, aggregated green fluorescent protein (GFP) as a substrate. Bacterial Hsp70 (DnaK), its co-chaperones (DnaJ and GrpE), and Hsp100 (ClpB) were incubated with aggregated GFP, and the increase in GFP fluorescence was monitored. Incubation of aggregated GFP with DnaK/DnaJ/GrpE but not with ClpB resulted in the rapid initiation of the disaggregation reaction. Under the same conditions a complex between DnaK, DnaJ, and GFP, but not ClpB, was formed as demonstrated by sedimentation analysis and light scattering experiments. Chaperone-dependent disaggregation of chemically denatured aggregated luciferase showed that, similar to GFP disaggregation, incubation with Hsp70 results in the rapid start of the reactivation reaction. For both aggregated GFP and luciferase, incubation with Hsp70 chaperones changes the initial rate but not the overall efficiency or rate of the refolding reaction. Our results clearly demonstrate that the interaction of DnaK and its co-chaperones with aggregated substrate is the rate-limiting reaction at the initial steps of disaggregation.

Our results clearly demonstrate that the interaction of DnaK and its co-chaperones with aggregated substrate is the rate-limiting reaction at the initial steps of disaggregation. Protein folding and maintenance in the cell require several molecular chaperones, which form transient, dynamic complexes with their protein substrates through hydrophobic interactions (1Wickner S. Maurizi M.R. Gottesman S. Science. 1999; 286: 1888-1893Crossref PubMed Scopus (916) Google Scholar, 2Bukau B. Deuerling E. Pfund C. Craig E. Cell. 2000; 101: 119-122Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (353) Google Scholar). Chaperone proteins from several families specialize in performing particular functions; therefore cooperation between chaperones from different families is very often required (1Wickner S. Maurizi M.R. Gottesman S. Science. 1999; 286: 1888-1893Crossref PubMed Scopus (916) Google Scholar, 2Bukau B. Deuerling E. Pfund C. Craig E. Cell. 2000; 101: 119-122Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (353) Google Scholar). Research in many laboratories has defined the function of chaperones within individual families. Yet the mechanistic details of the cooperation among the chaperones of different families are much less understood. ClpB, a member of the Hsp100 family in Escherichia coli, was identified as a thermotolerance conferring factor because mutations in the clpB gene severely decrease the survival rate of bacteria exposed to extreme heat (3Squires C.L. Pendersen S. Ross B. Squires C. J. Bacteriol. 1991; 173: 4254-4262Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 4Kitagawa M. Wada C. Yoshioka S. Yura T. J. Bacteriol. 1991; 173: 4247-4253Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae a similar decrease was observed in the survival rate of the hsp104 deletion strain (5Sanchez Y. Lindquist S. Science. 1990; 248: 1112-1115Crossref PubMed Scopus (656) Google Scholar, 6Sanchez Y. Taulien J. Borkovich K.A. Lindquist S. EMBO J. 1992; 11: 2357-2364Crossref PubMed Scopus (469) Google Scholar), which lacks the cytosolic member of the Hsp100 family. It was also shown that Hsp78, a mitochondrial member of the same chaperone family, plays a role in the thermotolerance of the respiratory function of mitochondria (7Schmitt M. Neupert W. Langer T. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 134: 1375-1386Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). Heat treatment of both bacteria and yeast results in the accumulation of aggregated proteins inside cells (8Parsell D.A.

EMBO J. 1999; 18: 6934-6949Crossref PubMed Scopus (516) Google Scholar). Studies on the reactivation of aggregated proteins following thermal stress showed that chaperones from the Hsp100 family alone are not sufficient for disaggregation. Other chaperone proteins are additionally involved in this process. For example, in E. coli Hsp70 (DnaK) and its co-chaperones cooperate with ClpB in the disaggregation of several aggregated proteins (10Mogk A. Tomoyasu T. Goloubinoff P. Rüdiger S. Röder D. Langen H. Bukau B. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 6934-6949Crossref PubMed Scopus (516) Google Scholar). Similarly, in studies performed on yeast it was shown that besides Hsp78, mitochondrial Hsp70 and its co-chaperones are needed for protection and reactivation of the organelle functions following heat stress (7Schmitt M. Neupert W. Langer T. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 134: 1375-1386Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar, 11Germaniuk A. Liberek K. Marszalek J. J. Biol.

The E. coli Hsp100 (ClpB) protein belongs to the AAA+ (ATPase associated with various cellular activities) superfamily of proteins. AAA+ proteins self-assemble into oligomeric structures and use the energy from ATP hydrolysis to remodel their target substrates (12Vale R.D. J. Cell Biol. 2000; 150: F13-F19Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). ClpB consists of an N-terminal domain and two ATP-binding domains that mediate ATP hydrolysis, are essential for ClpB oligomerization and chaperone function (13Krzewska J. Konopa G. Liberek K. J.

Trends Biochem. Sci. 1996; 21: 289-296Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (576) Google Scholar). Recent structural data obtained for ClpB from Thermus thermophilus show that the hexamer of this protein forms a two-tiered ring structure with a 16-Å hole in the top ring and six smaller openings on the lateral surface of the molecule (19Lee S. Sowa M.E. Watanabe Y.H. Sigler P.B. Yoshida M. Tsai F.T. Cell. 2003; 115: 229-240Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (357) Google Scholar). The other group of chaperones required for efficient protein disaggregation, that is Hsp70 and its co-chaperones, has been studied for a relatively long time. The E. coli Hsp70 (DnaK) chaperone and its DnaJ and GrpE cohorts play a role in a variety of cellular processes including the folding of newly synthesized proteins (20Teter S.A. Houry W.A. Ang D.

EMBO J. 1998; 17: 4818-4828Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar). Correct selection of substrates is crucial for DnaK function. The affinity of DnaK for substrates is regulated by ATP, e.g. DnaK exhibits low affinity and a fast exchange rate for substrates in the ATP-bound state and high affinity and a low exchange rate in the ADP-bound state (24Schmid D. Baici A. Gehring H. Christen P. Science. 1994; 263: 971-973Crossref PubMed Scopus (423) Google Scholar). DnaJ triggers the hydrolysis of DnaK-bound ATP (25Liberek K. Marszalek J. Ang D. Georgopoulos C. Zylicz M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 2874-2878Crossref PubMed Scopus (690) Google Scholar) and thus modulates the affinity of DnaK for substrates. An additional role of DnaJ is to target substrates to DnaK (26Wawrzynow A. Zylicz M. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 19300-19306Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar, 27Liberek K. Wall D. Georgopoulos C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Substrate release is mediated by ADP/ATP exchange, a process catalyzed by the GrpE co-chaperone, a nucleotide exchange factor. In some processes, the DnaK/DnaJ/GrpE chaperone system cooperates with other chaperones, for example with the Hsp60 (GroEL/GroES) system in protein folding (30Langer T. Lu C. Echlos H. Flanagan J. Hayer M.K. Hartl F.U. Nature. 1992; 356: 683-689Crossref PubMed Scopus (790) Google Scholar) and both Hsp100 (ClpB) (31Goloubinoff P. Mogk A. Zvi A.P.B. Tomayasu T. Bukau B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.

The ability of the DnaK/DnaJ/GrpE system itself to reactivate aggregated proteins is limited to certain substrates, including RNA polymerase (35Skowyra D. Georgopoulos C. Zylicz M.

The addition of ClpB protein to the DnaK/DnaJ/GrpE reactivation system results in a much broader range of potential substrates and furthermore lowers the concentration of chaperones needed for the efficient resolubilization of aggregated substrates in vitro (31Goloubinoff P.

Similar chaperone systems able to actively disaggregate denatured protein substrates in vitro were established for yeast cytosolic and mitochondrial chaperone proteins. Each of these systems, in analogy to the bacterial one, consists of a member of the Hsp100 family (Hsp104 for yeast cytosol and Hsp78 for yeast mitochondria) and an Hsp70 family member with its co-chaperones (Ssa1p or Ydj1p for yeast cytosol and Ssc1p, Mdj1p, or Mge1p for yeast mitochondria) (40Glover J.R. Lindquist S. Cell. 1998; 94: 73-82Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1105) Google Scholar, 41Krzewska J. Langer T. Liberek K. FEBS Lett. 2001; 489: 92-96Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar). Attempts to replace the components of each system with the homologous chaperones from another cellular compartment or organism indicated that a specific functional cooperation exists between chaperones from the Hsp100 and Hsp70 families in the reactivation process (40Glover J.R. Lindquist S. Cell. 1998; 94: 73-82Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1105) Google Scholar, 41Krzewska J. Langer T. Liberek K.

However, the mechanism of this cooperation and the order of events leading to efficient disaggregation are unclear. We investigated in detail the requirements for the cooperation between ClpB and the DnaK/DnaJ/GrpE system in the disaggregation of aggregated substrate proteins. To do this, we developed a system that enabled us to follow real time measurements of the disaggregation reaction. Protein Purification—GFP 1The abbreviations used are: GFP, green fluorescent protein; ATPγS, adenosine 5′-O-(thiotriphosphate). was purified from E. coli DH5α transformed with the pGFPuv plasmid (Clontech). GFP overproduction was induced by isopropyl-β-d-thiogalactopyranoside addition. The cells were lysed in a French press (Aminco) at 1000 p.s.i. The bacterial lysate was centrifuged at 26,000 rpm for 30 min, and the supernatant was mixed on ice with 96% ethanol (1/1, v/v). Ethanol-precipitated proteins were sedimented at 28,000 rpm. Green fluorescent supernatant containing mostly GFP was immediately dialyzed against buffer containing 40 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 10% glycerol (v/v), 100 mm NaCl. After the addition of ammonium sulfate to 20% of saturation, the proteins were loaded on a Phenyl-Sepharose HR5/5 (Amersham Biosciences) column and eluted with a 100-ml 20–0% (percentage of saturation) ammonium sulfate and 0–20% (v/v) glycerol gradient. Fractions containing GFP were pooled and dialyzed to remove salt. GFP present in these fractions was concentrated by a step elution from a 2-ml Q-Sepharose Fast Flow (Amersham Biosciences) column with buffer containing 40 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 10% (v/v) glycerol, and 150 mm NaCl. Published protocols were used for the purification of E. coli DnaK, DnaJ, GrpE, (43Zylicz M. Ang D. Liberek K. Georgopoulos C. EMBO J. 1989; 8: 1601-1608Crossref PubMed Scopus (203) Google Scholar), and ClpB (44Woo K.M. Kim K.L. Goldberg A.L. Ha D.B. Chung C.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 20429-20434Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Firefly luciferase (E1701) was purchased from Promega. Protein concentrations were determined with the Bradford (Bio-Rad) assay system, using bovine serum albumin as a standard. Molar concentrations are given assuming a hexameric structure for ClpB and a monomeric structure for the rest of the proteins. GFP Disaggregation Experiments—GFP at a concentration of 2 mg/ml was thermally inactivated in buffer containing 40 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 10% (v/v) glycerol, and 150 mm NaCl by incubation for 15 min at 85 °C in 5-μl aliquots. Following thermal inactivation GFP was frozen in liquid nitrogen. Disaggregation reactions were performed at 25 °C in a 450-μl final volume in a spectrofluorometric cuvette in buffer containing 40 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.8, 50 mm NaCl, 20 mm KCl, 20 mm MgCl2, 5 mm β-mercaptoethanol, and 10% (v/v) glycerol. In the experiments presented in Figs. 3 and 4B potassium glutamate was used at 85 mm concentration instead of KCl and NaCl. ATP was present in all reaction mixtures at 5 mm concentration. GFP in the disaggregation reaction was present at 0.5 μm, DnaK at 1 μm, DnaJ at 0.2 μm, GrpE at 0.1 μm, and ClpB at 0.65 μm concentration. Increase in GFP fluorescence was measured in a PerkinElmer Life Sciences LS50B spectrofluorometer with excitation at 395 nm and emission at 510 nm. The entrance slit was set to 5 nm, and the emission slit was set to 10 nm. The short time scale plots presented in Figs. 3B and 4 were corrected for the starting point to facilitate comparison. The fluorescence recorded at 510 nm was proportional to the amount of native GFP in the cuvette, which allowed us to calculate the rate of GFP reactivation.Fig. 4Both chaperones and nucleotides are required for the rapid initiation of fluorescence increase during GFP disaggregation. A, GFP aggregates were incubated with either DnaK, DnaJ, and GrpE; DnaK and DnaJ; DnaK; DnaJ; or no chaperones for 5 min. Following this, the missing chaperones were added, and the increase of fluorescence was monitored. B, aggregated GFP was incubated first with DnaK and DnaJ chaperones in the presence of 1 mm ATP, 1 mm ADP, or 1 mm ATPγS. After 5 min of incubation, ClpB and GrpE chaperones along with 10 mm ATP were added, and the increase of GFP fluorescence was monitored. GFP fluorescence was measured at 510 nm following excitation at 395 nm.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) Light Scattering Experiments—Light scattering experiments were essentially performed as GFP disaggregation experiments. Light scattering was measured in a PerkinElmer Life Sciences LS50B spectrofluorometer with the excitation and emission set at 310 nm. The entrance and emission slits were set to 5 nm. The solution of chaperones was additionally subjected to a short spin prior to the addition to cuvette. Sizing Chromatography Experiments—Native or heat-denatured GFP (20 μg) in buffer 40 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.8, 100 mm NaCl was loaded onto a Sephacryl S-500 HR column (0.7 × 29 cm) equilibrated with the same buffer. Chromatography was carried out at a flow rate of 0.4 ml/min at 4 °C. The fractions (200 μl) were collected and analyzed by SDS-PAGE followed by Western blot analysis with anti-GFP monoclonal antibodies. The column was calibrated with the Bio-Rad gel filtration chromatography standards. The void volume of the column was determined by sizing the intact E. coli cells overproducing GFP followed by fluorescence analysis. Sedimentation Experiments—The reaction mixture contained 15 μg of native or heat-denatured GFP, and as indicated 10 μg of ClpB, 5 μg of DnaJ, and 10 μg of DnaK in 50 μl of buffer (40 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.8, 50 mm NaCl, 20 mm KCl, 20 mm MgCl2, 5 mm β-mercaptoethanol, and 5mm ATP or ATPγS). The chaperone proteins and native GFP samples were briefly spun down prior to the start of the reaction. The reaction mixture was applied on a 3-ml 15–40% (v/v) glycerol gradient in the same buffer containing 0.5 mm ATP or ATPγS. The gradients were sedimented at 4 °C in a Beckman SW 60 rotor for 22 h at 46,000 rpm. The fractions were collected from the top of the gradients. The proteins present at the bottom of the centrifugation tube were resuspended in buffer containing 1% SDS, separated by SDS-PAGE, and stained with Coomassie Brilliant Blue. Refolding of Guanidine Hydrochloride-denatured Luciferase—Firefly luciferase (2 μm) was denatured for 3 h at 37°Cin buffer containing 40 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 50 mm KCl, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 15 mm magnesium acetate, 5% (v/v) glycerol, and 2 m guanidine hydrochloride. For refolding, denatured luciferase was diluted to 50 nm in the same buffer without denaturant and then incubated at 25 °C. The reaction was supplemented with ATP (5 mm), an ATP regenerating system (10 mm phosphocreatine, 100 μg/ml phosphocreatine kinase), 0.15 mg/ml bovine serum albumin, and chaperone proteins as indicated in the figure legends. The luciferase activity was determined in a Beckman scintillation counter using the Luciferase Assay System (Promega E1500). GFP Disaggregation Depends on Both the DnaK and ClpB Chaperones—To study in detail the cooperation between ClpB and the DnaK and co-chaperones in the disaggregation of substrate proteins, we developed a system that allowed us to follow real time measurements of this reaction. We took advantage of the fact that the fluorescence of the GFP depends on its proper folding. Only when the chromophore group is buried inside the β-barrel-like structure can the fluorescence characteristic to GFP be detected (45Tsien R.Y. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1998; 67: 509-544Crossref PubMed Scopus (4946) Google Scholar). We destabilized the otherwise extremely stable GFP protein structure by thermal denaturation at 85 °C. Such a treatment resulted in the complete loss of the characteristic fluorescence of GFP (Fig. 1A) and its extensive aggregation. Sizing chromatography (Fig. 1B) revealed that the majority of heat-treated GFP was eluted from the column in the fractions 30–34 corresponding to the molecular mass of ∼1–2 × 106 Da. Similar results were obtained by sedimentation analysis. The majority of heat-treated GFP sedimented in glycerol gradient 2–3-fold faster than the purified RNA polymerase (∼ 400 kDa) (result not shown). Monomers of GFP were not detected either by sizing chromatography or sedimentation analysis (Fig. 1B and result not shown). The GFP aggregates obtained following thermal inactivation did not refold spontaneously, because the characteristic fluorescence was not observed, even following prolonged incubation (Fig. 2A). To measure GFP disaggregation and refolding in real time, protein aggregates were placed in a spectrofluorometric cuvette, ClpB and DnaK/DnaJ/GrpE chaperones were added, and the fluorescence characteristic to GFP was monitored. Following an initial ∼2-min lag phase, GFP fluorescence increased linearly up to 30 min (Fig. 2B). Then the rate of the fluorescence increase became slower. After 100 min of GFP disaggregation and reactivation, the recovered GFP fluorescence reached approximately 30–40% of the fluorescence of nondenatured GFP (Fig. 2). The observed increase in GFP fluorescence correlated well with the formation of GFP monomers, as monitored by sedimentation analysis (result not shown). Thus, we conclude that GFP aggregates are efficiently disaggregated by this bi-chaperone system. In control experiments it was shown that a separate addition of ClpB alone to GFP aggregates did not lead to a fluorescence increase, whereas the addition of DnaK/DnaJ/GrpE alone resulted only in a slight increase in GFP fluorescence (Fig. 2A). This increase of fluorescence most likely reflects the DnaK/DnaJ/GrpE-dependent reactivation of small GFP aggregates (∼100 kDa), little amounts of which were detected in aggregated GFP preparation by sizing chromatography. It is important to mention here that the folding of completely unfolded GFP monomers takes place in 20–30 s and does not require the presence of chaperones (45Tsien R.Y. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1998; 67: 509-544Crossref PubMed Scopus (4946) Google Scholar, 46Makino Y. Amada K. Taguchi H. Yoshida M. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 12468-12474Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). Therefore, we assumed that the limiting step of the observed GFP fluorescence increase was not the spontaneous refolding of GFP monomers but the chaperone-dependent disaggregation reaction. The dependence of GFP disaggregation on the presence of chaperones from the Hsp100 and Hsp70 systems enabled us to perform a detailed analysis of the initial steps during the disaggregation reaction.Fig. 2Thermally denatured GFP is reactivated by the ClpB-DnaK/DnaJ/GrpE bi-chaperone system. Increase of the fluorescence of denatured GFP following incubation with ClpB, DnaK, DnaJ, and GrpE; ClpB alone; DnaK, DnaJ, and GrpE; or no chaperones. GFP fluorescence was monitored in the long (A) and short (B) time period at 510 nm following excitation at 395 nm.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) Preincubation of Aggregated GFP with DnaK/DnaJ Results in Faster Start of Disaggregation—To investigate the order of chaperone action in the disaggregation reaction, GFP aggregates were preincubated first in the spectrofluorometric cuvette for 5 min in the presence of ATP with either ClpB or DnaK/DnaJ/GrpE chaperones. Then, at time 0, the missing chaperone components were added, and GFP fluorescence was monitored. When GFP aggregates were first incubated with ClpB, before the addition of the DnaK/DnaJ/GrpE chaperones, the lag phase in the increase of fluorescence was the same as that observed when the complete set of chaperone proteins was added simultaneously (Fig. 3, A and B). In contrast, when GFP aggregates were incubated first with the DnaK/DnaJ/GrpE chaperones, followed by ClpB addition, no lag phase was observed, and GFP fluorescence increased linearly from the moment of ClpB addition (Fig. 3, A and B). In both cases, the efficiency of GFP disaggregation was similar (approximately 40% of the fluorescence of nondenatured GFP). We calculated and compared the rates of GFP refolding during the disaggregation reactions. Based on the shape of the fluorescence curve, we chose two time periods in which the reaction rates were calculated, the initial rate (the average rate in the first 2 min of the reaction) and final rate (the rate during the linear increase of fluorescence measured between 10 and 12 min of the reaction). The initial rate of GFP refolding was ∼4.6-fold higher in the case when aggregated GFP was preincubated with DnaK/DnaJ/GrpE as compared with ClpB preincubation (Fig. 3C). The comparison of the final rates gave nearly the same value regardless of the order of chaperone addition (62.6 ng of GFP refolded per min for DnaK/DnaJ/GrpE preincubation and 59 ng of GFP/min for ClpB preincubation) (Fig. 3C). These results taken together show that the DnaK chaperone system must interact with aggregated GFP prior to ClpB chaperone. To further determine which component of the DnaK system is needed at the preincubation step, GFP aggregates were incubated either with DnaK or DnaJ alone, with both DnaK and DnaJ, or with the whole DnaK system (DnaK/DnaJ/GrpE). Following this, the missing chaperones were added, and GFP fluorescence was monitored. Preincubation of aggregated GFP with DnaK or DnaJ resulted in initial rates comparable with those measured when no chaperones were present at the preincubation step (Fig. 4A). In contrast, preincubation of GFP aggregates with both DnaK and DnaJ resulted in a fast initial rate of fluorescence increase, comparable with the rate measured following preincubation with the entire DnaK/DnaJ/GrpE chaperone system (Fig. 4A). These experiments demonstrate that the simultaneous presence of at least DnaK and DnaJ is required at the initial step of the disaggregation reaction. Presence of ATP Is Required at the Initial Step of Disaggregation—It is known that the affinity of DnaK for substrates depends on the nature of its bound nucleotide and that this process is regulated by the DnaJ co-chaperone. DnaJ also targets various substrates for DnaK binding (26Wawrzynow A. Zylicz M. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 19300-19306Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar, 27Liberek K.

https://openalex.org/W2050345315,"The means by which calcium is transported into the milk produced by mammary glands is a poorly understood process. One hypothesis is that it occurs during exocytosis of secretory products via the Golgi pathway, consistent with the observation that the SPCA1 Ca<sup>2+</sup>-ATPase, which is expressed in the Golgi, is induced in lactating mammary tissue. However, massive up-regulation of the PMCA2bw plasma membrane Ca<sup>2+</sup>-ATPase also occurs during lactation and is more strongly correlated with increases in milk calcium, suggesting that calcium may be secreted directly via this pump. To examine the physiological role of PMCA2bw in lactation we compared lactating PMCA2-null mice to heterozygous and wild-type mice. Relative expression levels of individual milk proteins were unaffected by genotype. However, milk from PMCA2-null mice had 60% less calcium than milk from heterozygous and wild-type mice, the total milk protein concentration was lower, and an indirect measure of milk production (litter weights) suggested that the PMCA2-null mice produce significantly less milk. In contrast, lactose was higher in milk from PMCA2-null mice during early lactation, but by day 12 of lactation there were no differences in milk lactose between the three genotypes. These data demonstrate that the activity of PMCA2bw is required for secretion of much of the calcium in milk. This major secretory function represents a novel biological role for the plasma membrane Ca<sup>2+</sup>-ATPases, which are generally regarded as premier regulators of intracellular Ca<sup>2+</sup>."
https://openalex.org/W1965888721,"Anaplerotic flux into the Kreb's cycle is crucial for glucose-stimulated insulin secretion from pancreatic β-cells. However, the regulation of flux through various anaplerotic pathways in response to combinations of physiologically relevant substrates and its impact on glucose-stimulated insulin secretion is unclear. Because different pathways of anaplerosis generate distinct products, they may differentially modulate the insulin secretory response. To examine this question, we applied 13C-isotopomer analysis to quantify flux through three anaplerotic pathways: 1) pyruvate carboxylase of pyruvate derived from glycolytic sources; 2) pyruvate carboxylase of pyruvate derived from nonglycolytic sources; and 3) glutamate dehydrogenase (GDH). At substimulatory glucose, anaplerotic flux rate in the clonal INS-1 832/13 cells was ∼40% of Kreb's cycle flux, with similar contributions from each pathway. Increasing glucose to 15 mm stimulated insulin secretion ∼4-fold, and was associated with a ∼4-fold increase in anaplerotic flux that could mostly be attributed to an increase in PC flux. In contrast, the addition of glutamine to the perfusion media stimulated GDH flux ∼6-fold at both glucose concentrations without affecting insulin secretion rates. In conclusion, these data support the hypothesis that a signal generated by anaplerosis from increased pyruvate carboxylase flux is essential for glucose-stimulated insulin secretion in β-cells and that anaplerosis through GDH does not play a major role in this process.

Glucose homeostasis depends on the appropriate release of insulin from the pancreatic β-cell in response to increases in blood glucose concentrations. Although, it is well established that glucose-stimulated insulin secretion requires mitochondrial carbohydrate oxidation to drive ATP production (1Matschinsky F.M. Diabetes. 1996; 45: 223-241Crossref PubMed Scopus (0) Google Scholar), a number of studies have suggested that intermediates (e.g. malonyl-CoA (2Prentki M. Vischer S. Glennon M.C. Regazzi R.

Nature. 1999; 402: 685-689Crossref PubMed Scopus (442) Google Scholar)) generated, directly or indirectly, from anaplerosis may act as second messengers linking glucose oxidation with insulin secretion. Previous studies of anaplerotic flux have typically examined only a single anaplerotic pathway (pyruvate carboxylase (PC), 1The abbreviations used are: PC, pyruvate carboxylase; GDH, glutamate dehydrogenase; PCNG, pyruvate carboxylase of pyruvate derived from nonglycolytic sources; PDH, pyruvate dehydrogenase; ACS, acetyl-CoA synthetase; KRB, Krebs Ringer bicarbonate buffer; YS, anaplerosis leading to succinyl-CoA; PCG, pyruvate carboxylase of pyruvate derived from glycolytic sources. or glutamate dehydrogenase (GDH)) with a single substrate. Given the complexity and interdependence of these fluxes, a comprehensive and simultaneous evaluation of the relative contribution and regulation of alternate anaplerotic pathways and substrates into the Kreb's cycle is essential to understand the relative role of these individual fluxes in the regulation of glucose-stimulated insulin secretion. The experimental design of most previous studies have either inhibited competing anaplerotic pathways or used methodology that preclude any analysis of the coordination of flux through competing anaplerotic pathways. To address these limitations, we examined the relationship between insulin secretion and the pathways of anaplerosis in clonal INS-1 832/13 cells under conditions of low (2.5 mm) and high (15 mm) glucose. In addition, we also examined the effect of glutamine and leucine on these fluxes. Relative rates of the anaplerotic pathways: 1) pyruvate carboxylase of pyruvate derived from glycolytic sources (PCG); 2) pyruvate carboxylase of pyruvate derived from nonglycolytic sources (PCNG); 3) GDH, as well as from the non-anaplerotic pathways: pyruvate dehydrogenase (PDH) and acetyl-CoA synthetase (ACS) fluxes were determined from 13C NMR analysis of glutamate isotopomers derived from metabolism of [U-13C]glucose under each substrate condition.

INS-1 cells (micoplasm-free) were cultivated as monolayers in RPMI 1640 with 11.1 mm d-glucose supplemented with 10% (v/v) fetal calf serum, antibiotics (10,000 units/ml penicillin and 10 mg/ml streptomycin), 10 mm HEPES, 2 mm l-glutamine, 1 mm sodium pyruvate, and 50 μm β-mecaptoethanol. Cultures were maintained at 37 °C under humidified (5% CO2, 95% air) conditions. Cellular viability is assessed by the trypan blue staining method. Cells were subcultured into T-150 flasks at a density of ∼10 × 106 cells per flask and incubated at 37 °C in the presence of 5% CO2. 13C-Isotopomer Studies of Anaplerotic Pathways—INS-1 832/13 cells, at 80% confluence, were preincubated for 2 h at low glucose (2.5 mm) in KRB to establish basal conditions (12Li C. Najafi H. Daikhin Y. Nissim I. Collins H.W. Yudkoff M. Matschinsky F.M. Stanley C.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 2853-2858Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar). The cells were then washed to remove unlabeled glucose, and then incubated for 2 h in KRB with [U-13C]glucose (Cambridge Isotope Laboratories, Miamisburg, OH; 99% 13C, 2.5 or 15 mm), alone or supplemented with 4 mm glutamine and 10 mm leucine (singly, or in combination). Media aliquots were taken and placed on ice for insulin analysis at 0, 1, and 2 h. At the end of the 2-h isotopic labeling period, the media was removed and frozen for later analysis. The monolayer of cells was quenched with ice-cold 77% ethanol, 1% HCl, and snap frozen in liquid N2. Frozen cells were scraped from the plate, sonically disrupted, and neutralized with KOH. The cell suspension was then centrifuged (3,000 rpm for 5 min). An aliquot of the supernatant was used for protein and insulin assays, the remainder of the supernatant (and media) was lyophilized, and redissolved in 400 μl of D2O for NMR analysis. 13C-Isotopic Analysis of Leucine Oxidation—The relative contribution of leucine to the acetyl-CoA pool was determined from glutamate C-4 enrichment resulting from label input from [U-13C]glucose in comparison to label input from [U-13C]leucine. Thus, INS-1 832/13 cells were incubated in: 1) KRB with 15 mm [U-13C]glucose, 4 mm glutamine, and 10 mm leucine; or 2) KRB with 15 mm glucose, 4 mm glutamine, and 10 mm [U-13C]leucine. All other incubation conditions, and metabolite extractions, were as described above. Under condition 1, 13C enrichment in glutamate C-4 can only arise from PDH flux of [U-13C]pyruvate (from [U-13C]glucose). Under condition 2, 13C enrichment in glutamate C-4 can only arise from deamination of [U-13C]leucine to [U-13C]α-ketoisocaproic acid, and after several enzymatic steps, conversion to [U-13C]acetyl-CoA (13Giroix M.-H. Saulnier C. Portha B. Diabetogia. 1999; 42: 965-977Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). The contribution of leucine to the acetyl-CoA supplying citrate synthase flux was calculated as the following.% AcCoA from leucine= (G4 APE from [U-13C]leucine/G4 APE from [U-13C]glucose)× % acetyl-CoA from [U-13C] glucose(eq.1) Where, G4 APE is the 13C enrichment of glutamate C-4, and the % acetyl-CoA from [U-13C]glucose was determined from the isotopomer modeling analysis of [U-13C]glucose, as described below. NMR Analysis—The relative enrichments, and isotopomer distributions, of glutamate, glutamine, lactate, and alanine at each carbon position was determined by 13C NMR spectroscopy with an AVANCE 500-MHz spectrometer (Bruker Instruments, Inc., Billerica, MA) (14Jucker B.M. Rennings A.J.M. Cline G.W. Shulman G.I. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 10464-10473Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). Spectra were acquired with TR = 0.5 s, NS = 10,000, 16 K data, and Waltz-16 broadband proton decoupling. Correction factors for differences in T1 relaxation times, and NOE were determined from fully relaxed spectra of standard solutions. Proton-observed carbon-enhanced 1H spectroscopy was performed to determine absolute 13C enrichment at glutamate C-4, and alanine C-3, as previously described (14Jucker B.M. Rennings A.J.M. Cline G.W. Shulman G.I. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 10464-10473Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). Metabolite Analysis—Glucose concentration in the media was determined by the glucose oxidase reaction (Glucose Analyzer II; Beckman Instruments, Fullerton, CA). Total protein was measured spectrophotometrically, based on the method of Bradford (Bio-Rad). Insulin was determined by ultrasensitive enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay for rat insulin (ALPCO). This assay has 100% cross-reactivity to human insulin; therefore, all insulin secreted from this clonal INS-1 cell line is detected. ATP concentrations were determined separately in INS-1 832/13 cells propagated in 6-well plates to ∼80% confluent. Incubation conditions and substrate additions were identical to that described for the 13C labeling experiments. At the end of the incubation period, cells were treated with trypsin, and two wells for each condition were pooled and assessed for viability with trypan blue. Half of the sample was pelleted and resuspended in Somatic Cell Releasing Agent (Sigma) to a concentration of <2.5 × 105 cells per 150 μl. ATP concentrations were measured with an AutoLumat LB953 (EG & G Berthold Instruments) using the Bioluminescent Somatic Cell Assay Kit (Sigma). The remaining half of the cell sample was analyzed for ATP/ADP ratios as described below. The cells were pelleted and then resuspended in 50 μl of 50% aqueous acetonitrile. The precipitate from the lysate was pelleted in a table-top centrifuge. A spermine spike was added to the supernatant to a final concentration of 3 mm. 4 μl of sample per sample was injected into an API 3000 LC/MS/MS (PE Sciex, Foster City, CA) with 50% aqueous acetonitrile as running buffer. ATP and ADP signals from the lysate were observed in negative ion MRM mode selecting for the ribose moiety in the first quadruple and with m-1 of the nucleotide phosphate in the second. Ratios were calculated following integration of the di- and triphosphate peak within each replicate. Statistical Analyses—All data are reported as mean ± S.E. Unpaired two-tailed Student's t tests were used to test for comparisons between groups. Differences were considered statistically significant at p < 0.05. Correlation of insulin secretion with metabolic fluxes was assessed from Pearson correlation analysis. Anaplerotic Pathways into Kreb's Cycle from Steady-state Analysis of 13C-Isotopomer of Glutamate—Metabolism of [U-13C]glucose results in labeling of Kreb's cycle intermediates in ways that are characteristic of its point of entry, as well as input from other pathways, thereby providing an experimentally convenient means of simultaneously quantifying relative flux through multiple pathways from a single isotopic tracer input. Steady-state flux rates, relative to Kreb's cycle flux, were calculated from the isotopomers of glutamate observed at carbon positions 2, 3, and 4 in the 13C NMR spectra, and modeled using the program “tcacalc” (15Malloy C.R. Sherry A.D. Jeffrey F.M. Am. J. Physiol. 1990; 259: H987-H995Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Using the nomenclature adopted by the authors for tcacalc, the model was used to provide the best fit to our NMR data by calculating the relative fluxes of ACS, lactate dehydrogenase, PDH, PC, pyruvate kinase (PK), anaplerosis leading to succinyl-CoA (YS), and enrichments of “lactate” and “fat” (15Malloy C.R. Sherry A.D. Jeffrey F.M. Am. J. Physiol. 1990; 259: H987-H995Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Fat includes all metabolite inputs into acetyl-CoA other than glucose (e.g. leucine). All flux rates are represented in proportion to citrate synthase flux of 1, and is considered to be equivalent to Kreb's cycle flux. Citrate synthase flux is modeled as the sum of pyruvate dehydrogenase flux of labeled and unlabeled pyruvate, and of acetyl-CoA synthase flux, as presented in Scheme 1. It should be recognized that PC may also include anaplerotic flux of pyruvate into malate from malic enzyme activity. YS represents unidirectional anaplerotic flux of substrates that lead to succinyl-CoA. As originally designed, YS represented flux of a propionate tracer into the Kreb's cycle. In our experiments, YS represents the rate of synthesis of α-ketoglutarate from glutamate (Scheme 1: GDH). The percent anaplerosis (Fig. 2) to total Kreb's cycle flux was calculated as follows.% Anaplerosis=(PC+YS)/(PC+YS+PDH+ACS)(eq.2) The relative rates of labeled and unlabeled substrates were calculated as the product of the precursor enrichment and the relative rates. Pyruvate cycling was calculated, as proposed by Lu et al. (11Lu D. Mulder H. Zhao P. Burgess S.C. Jensen M.V. Kamzplova S. Newgard C. Sherry A.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 2708-2713Crossref PubMed Scopus (221) Google Scholar) as the average of the flux rates of PC and pyruvate kinase. Glucose Utilization, Oxidation, and Anaplerotic Pathways from Steady-state Analysis of 13C-Isotopic Isomers of Glutamate—Relative rates of glucose metabolism were determined from isotopomer analysis as previously described (15Malloy C.R. Sherry A.D. Jeffrey F.M. Am. J. Physiol. 1990; 259: H987-H995Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Isotopic isomers were identified from the 13C-13C J-coupling constants, and quantified by integration of line fitting (NUTS, Acorn, Inc.) to the glutamate resonances at C-2 (∼55ppm), C-3 (∼28 ppm), and C-4 (∼34 ppm). The 13C NMR spectrum of glutamate isotopomers that are generated by clonal INS-1 832/13 cells after incubation with 15 mm [U-13C]glucose is shown in Fig. 1. The addition of glutamine to the media significantly decreased the relative concentration of triply labeled glutamate C3-C4-C5 (decrease of C-4 quartet), and the triply labeled glutamate C2-C3-C4 (decrease of C-3 triplet). Pathways of Anaplerotic Flux—At substimulatory concentrations of glucose (2.5 mm), anaplerotic flux (PCG + PCNG + GDH) accounted for 40 ± 4% of Kreb's cycle flux (Fig. 2, Group 1), with approximately equivalent contributions from each anaplerotic pathway. Addition of 4 mm glutamine to the media increased anaplerotic flux 3-fold, such that anaplerotic flux accounted for 67 ± 4% of total carbon entry into the Kreb's cycle (Fig. 2, Group 2). Isotopomer analysis revealed that this increase in anaplerotic flux was mostly through an increase in GDH flux. The addition of leucine (10 mm) induced a significant increase in the anaplerotic contribution of unlabeled substrate through PC (Fig. 2, Group 3). When glutamine and leucine were both provided (Fig. 2, Group 4), anaplerotic flux accounted for 74 ± 2% of carbon entry in the Kreb's cycle, with the leucine-associated increase in PC flux accounting for about one-half of the total. Notably, we were unable to detect any further activation of GDH flux by leucine above that induced by glutamine alone. Raising glucose to 15 mm stimulated an increase of total anaplerotic flux similar to that observed by the addition of 4 mm glutamine to low glucose (Fig. 2, compare Groups 1 to 2, and 1 to 5). In contrast to glutamine, high glucose stimulated pyruvate carboxylase flux (Fig. 2, Group 5) without effecting GDH flux. Similar to the results at low glucose, addition of 4 mm glutamine to 15 mm glucose stimulated GDH flux ∼6-fold (Fig. 2, Groups 2 and 6), whereas leucine (10 mm), in the absence of exogenous glutamine, had a modest stimulatory effect on PC flux (Fig. 2, Group 7). The combination of 15 mm glucose, leucine (10 mm), and glutamine (4 mm) stimulated increases in all three anaplerotic pathways above basal levels (Fig. 2, Groups 1 and 8), with similar contributions of PC, PCNG, and GDH to the total anaplerotic flux. Pyruvate Cycling—Pyruvate cycling (Table I) in the clonal INS-1 832/13 cells was responsive to step increases of glucose, and the increase from 0.33 ± 0.07 to 1.22 ± 0.20 on going from low to high glucose was similar to that previously reported (11Lu D. Mulder H. Zhao P. Burgess S.C. Jensen M.V. Kamzplova S. Newgard C. Sherry A.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 2708-2713Crossref PubMed Scopus (221) Google Scholar). Addition of leucine, or the combination of leucine and glutamine to low glucose, significantly increased pyruvate cycling above basal conditions. At high glucose, cycling tended to increase with the addition of leucine, or leucine and glutamine, but was not significant.Table IPyruvate cycling in INS-1 832/13 cellsKRB bufferGlucose alone+4 mm Glutamine+10 mm Leucine+4 mm Glutamine + 10 mm leucine2.5 mm Glucose0.33 ± 0.070.65 ± 0.191.18 ± 0.29ap < 0.005.1.96 ± 0.67ap < 0.005.15 mm Glucose1.22 ± 0.20ap < 0.005.1.02 ± 0.23bp < 0.05.2.01 ± 0.86bp < 0.05.1.51 ± 0.28ap < 0.005.a p < 0.005.b p < 0.05. Open table in a new tab Glucose Oxidation—At a substimulatory glucose concentration (2.5 mm), about one-half of the acetyl-CoA was provided by PDH flux of glucose supplied in the media (Fig. 2, middle panel). At low glucose, adding exogenous glutamine (4 mm) significantly stimulated an increased flux of unlabeled carbon through PDH while decreasing synthesis of acetyl-CoA from ACS flux. Raising glucose to 15 mm increased its flux through PDH, such that ∼80% of the acetyl-CoA was supplied from glucose in the media. Although not significant, we noted a tendency for the addition of leucine to increase the ACS flux into acetyl-CoA because of increased leucine oxidation by transamination to α-ketoisocaproic acid, and eventual conversion to acetyl-CoA. Leucine Oxidation—After a 2-h incubation of INS-1 832/13 cells in KRB with 15 mm glucose (or [U-13C]glucose), 10 mm leucine (or [U-13C]leucine), and 4 mm glutamine, the 13C isotopic enrichment in glutamate C-4 was 12.5 ± 3.1% (n = 3), when label was provided from [U-13C]leucine. When the label was provided by [U-13C]glucose, the 13C isotopic enrichment in glutamate C-4 was 44.2 ± 0.7% (n = 3), and from isotopomer analysis, we calculated that 81 ± 5% of the acetyl-CoA originated from exogenous glucose (Fig. 2). From Equation 1, we calculate that under these conditions of high exogenous glucose, glutamine, and leucine, 23 ± 3% of the acetyl-CoA is derived from leucine catabolism. Insulin Secretion (Fig. 3)—Under basal conditions (2.5 mm glucose), the rate of insulin secretion was 1.51 ± 0.38 ng of insulin/mg of protein/h, which is comparable with previously published insulin secretion rates for this cell line (6Hohmeier H.E. Mulder H. Chen G. Henkel-Rieger R. Prentki M. Newgard C.B. Diabetes. 2000; 49: 424-430Crossref PubMed Scopus (717) Google Scholar). Addition of glutamine to low glucose had a negligible stimulatory effect on insulin secretion. Compared with basal rates, 15 mm glucose stimulated a ∼6-fold increase in insulin secretion. Glutamine and leucine tended to further stimulate the rate of insulin secretion, as high as ∼13-fold with the combination of 15 mm glucose, 4 mm glutamine, and 10 mm leucine. ATP Concentrations and ATP/ADP ratios—Cellular ATP concentrations following a 2-h equilibration period at 2.5 mm glucose, followed by a 2-h incubation with various substrate combinations are presented in Table II. ATP concentrations after 4 h in basal KRB (2.5 mm glucose) were ∼30% less than all other substrate conditions. Extrapolated to the beginning of the 2-h substrate incubation period, ATP was depleted by ∼15% and was restored by any and all added substrates. Thus, there was no correlation between insulin secretion and changes in ATP concentrations after 2 h of static incubations. Notably, and in contrast to the insulin results, there was no significant change in the ATP/ADP ratio in any of the conditions tested.Table IIATP concentrationKRB bufferGlucose alone+4 mm Glutamine+10 mm Leucine+4 mm Glutamine + 10 mm leucine2.5 mm Glucose10.3 ± 0.7 (7.8 + 1.2)14.6 ± 0.6ap < 0.05.

The purpose of this study was to quantify the relative importance of each of the pathways of anaplerosis: 1) pyruvate carboxylase of pyruvate derived from glycolytic sources (PCG); 2) pyruvate carboxylase of pyruvate derived from nonglycolytic sources (PCNG); and 3) GDH, as well as non-anaplerotic flux through PDH and ACS under the physiological conditions of competing substrates. The advantage of the 13C NMR isotopomer approach over the use of radiolabeled substrates is the ability to simultaneously follow the entry of multiple substrates through multiple pathways, and thus generate a comprehensive picture of Kreb's cycle metabolism in a single experiment (15Malloy C.R. Sherry A.D. Jeffrey F.M. Am. J. Physiol. 1990; 259: H987-H995Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Under basal conditions, only ∼60% of the acetyl-CoA is derived from PDH flux (Fig. 2). Labeled PC flux is ∼20% of citrate synthase flux, and surprisingly, an unlabeled pyruvate pool accounts for ∼15% of PDH flux and contributes an additional ∼10% to PC flux. Furthermore, GDH contributes ∼60% to total anaplerotic flux, even in the absence of exogenous glutamine. Thus, under basal conditions only approximately half of the carbons entering the TCA cycle are derived from glucose. We next investigated the effect that raising glucose concentrations, and the addition of the amino acids, leucine and glutamine, had on the metabolic pathways and insulin secretion. Although glutamine markedly increased GDH flux, regardless of the presence of leucine or high glucose concentrations, insulin secretion was independent of GDH flux (Fig. 4, panel G). However, we found a strong positive correlation of insulin secretion with PC flux, regardless of whether the pyruvate originated from glycolysis or another source (Fig. 4, panels A–C). Including PDH flux from the labeled glucose with total PC flux provided us with the strongest correlation with insulin secretion rates (Fig. 4, panel I). Thus, insulin secretion is enhanced when glucose oxidation is coupled to increased pyruvate carboxylase flux. Recently, Lu et al. (11Lu D. Mulder H. Zhao P. Burgess S.C. Jensen M.V. Kamzplova S. Newgard C. Sherry A.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 2708-2713Crossref PubMed Scopus (221) Google Scholar) proposed that the responsiveness of clonal INS-1 cells to glucose-stimulated insulin secretion was linked to the cycling of pyruvate and the Kreb's cycle intermediate, oxaloacetate (11Lu D. Mulder H. Zhao P. Burgess S.C. Jensen M.V. Kamzplova S. Newgard C. Sherry A.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 2708-2713Crossref PubMed Scopus (221) Google Scholar). Furthermore, they suggested that this cycling pyruvate pool was distinct from the pool of pyruvate used to sustain Kreb's cycle flux and oxidative phosphorylation. In contrast to their work, which examined glucose-stimulated insulin secretion where glucose was the only substrate, we evaluated pyruvate cycling in the INS-1 832/13 clonal cells incubated with multiple anaplerotic substrates (glucose, glutamine, and leucine). Under these conditions GDH contributes significantly to anaplerosis and more clearly resembles the in vivo milieu where competing nutrients may influence relative fluxes through alternative pathways. In agreement with their findings, we also observed a positive correlation (R2 = 0.538) between cycling and insulin secretion in response to increased glucose concentration. Moreover, the addition of glutamine and leucine increased PC flux still further and was coupled to greater insulin secretion. It has recently been proposed that increased anaplerotic flux through GDH is the key metabolic process underlying second phase insulin secretion (22Liu Y.-J. Cheng H. Drought H. MacDonald M.J. Sharp G.W.G. Straub S.G. Am. J. Physiol. 2003; 285: E380-E389Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). Our data in clonal INS-1 832/13 cells do not support this hypothesis. When glutamine was added to 2.5 mm glucose, we observed a ∼5-fold increase in GDH flux, but a negligible change in insulin secretion. Furthermore, when leucine was added with glutamine, GDH flux did not increase any further, but there was a marked increase in insulin secretion. Thus, increased GDH flux does not necessarily lead to increased insulin secretion, and the glutamine-induced increase of GDH flux can occur without leucine. The observation that GDH flux is minimally regulated by leucine agrees with a recent study by Li et al. (12Li C. Najafi H. Daikhin Y. Nissim I. Collins H.W. Yudkoff M. Matschinsky F.M. Stanley C.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 2853-2858Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar). They demonstrated that leucine-stimulated insulin secretion from islets is conditional, and concluded that under normal physiological conditions islets are refractory to leucine stimulation of GDH flux. Only when islets were cultured under conditions that reduced ATP levels by about one-half (i.e. glucose and glutamine-free media for 2 h), did leucine promote anaplerotic flux of glutamine through glutaminase and GDH. We could only achieve this level of ATP depletion and decrease the ATP/ADP ratio by culturing the cells in glucose and glutamine-free KRB for 4 h (Table II), or by treatment with the oxidative uncoupler, dinitrophenol (data not shown). Under our experimental conditions with 2.5 mm glucose present during the 2-h equilibration period, ATP levels dropped by ∼15%, but were restored to similar levels by all added substrates independent of stimulated insulin secretion. There were no significant differences in the ATP/ADP ratio under basal conditions compared with conditions of substrate-induced insulin secretion (Table II). Thus, in our studies ATP concentrations were maintained at levels where allosteric regulation of GDH by leucine is minimized. Leucine may also contribute to insulin secretion from catabolism to acetyl-CoA and subsequent oxidation. In fact, impaired leucine oxidation has been shown to be primarily responsible for the decreased leucine-stimulated insulin secretion from islets of diabetic rats (13Giroix M.-H. Saulnier C. Portha B. Diabetogia. 1999; 42: 965-977Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). We observed a trend for exogenous leucine to increase ACS flux by ∼50% (Fig. 2), which could be attributed to oxidation of leucine. Using [U-13C]leucine (10 mm) to directly assess leucine oxidation in the presence of 15 mm glucose and 4 mm glutamine in KRB, we calculated that leucine supplied ∼20% of acetyl-CoA. Our isotopomer analysis also indicated that leucine increased PC flux of both labeled and unlabeled carbons, distinct from both allosteric activation of GDH and leucine oxidation. Thus, leucine activation of PC flux may represent a novel role for leucine-stimulated insulin secretion. In conclusion, metabolic coupling to insulin secretion from clonal INS-1 832/13 cells best correlates with the flux of glucose through both pyruvate dehydrogenase and pyruvate carboxylase. Strikingly, there appears to be minimal correlation with anaplerotic input of non-glucose-derived carbons notably including those via GDH. This is despite the significant magnitude of some of these fluxes (with the total anaplerotic flux as high as ∼5–6-fold citrate synthase flux). It is unclear if the primary role of PC flux is to support the Kreb's cycle or contribute to a parallel pathway necessary for glucose-stimulated insulin secretion. Our data demonstrate that as the absolute flux of glucose through PDH approaches the total Kreb's cycle flux, that PC flux can increase severalfold beyond that of Kreb's cycle flux, suggesting that PC flux is contributing more than just the provision of oxaloacetate for citrate formation. Many disparate conclusions have been previously made about the relevance of different mitochondrial carbon pathways by perturbing and analyzing individual pathways. By simultaneously measuring fluxes through all these pathways we conclude that the fluxes of glucose carbon through both PC and PDH are the most relevant.

Recently, α6β4 has received much attention, because it was found to function as a signaling adaptor for growth factor-induced invasive growth (3Shaw L.M. Rabinovitz I. Wang H.H. Toker A.

In contrast to all other integrins, α6β4 couples to the intermediate filament cytoskeleton, and its regulation is likely to be different from other integrins. α6β4 is a major constituent of hemidesmosomes (6Jones J.C.

Cell Biol. 1999; 146: 1147-1160Crossref PubMed Scopus (188) Google Scholar). The upstream factors that regulate adhesion and migration to Ln-5 are not well understood, although cAMP has been shown to regulate the small GTPases RhoA and Rac in a protein kinase A (PKA)-dependent manner, thereby affecting cell migration on Ln-5 (for a review see Ref. 11Mercurio A.M. Rabinovitz I. Semin. Cancer Biol. 2001; 11: 129-141Crossref PubMed Scopus (197) Google Scholar). cAMP is a common second messenger that regulates many cellular processes. Until recently, PKA was thought to be the main target of cAMP in eukaryotic cells. However, Epac (exchange factor directly activated by cAMP), a widely expressed exchange factor for the small GTPases Rap1 and Rap2, has been shown to be a receptor for cAMP as well (12Kawasaki H.

Importantly, Epac controls a number of cellular processes previously attributed to PKA (for a review see Ref. 14Bos J.L. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2003; 4: 733-738Crossref PubMed Scopus (416) Google Scholar). Rap1 has recently attracted much attention, because it was shown to be involved in the regulation of cell adhesion in a variety of cell types (for reviews see Refs. 15.Bos, J. L., de Rooij, J., and Reedquist, K. A. (2001) 2, 369-377Google Scholar and 16Kinbara K. Goldfinger L.E. Hansen M. Chou F.L. Ginsberg M.H. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2003; 4: 767-776Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). cAMP also controls cell adhesion in many cell types, and recently a link between cAMP, Epac-Rap1, and regulation of cell adhesion has been established (17Rangarajan S. Enserink J.M. Kuiperij H.B. de Rooij J. Price L.S. Schwede F. Bos J.L. J. Cell Biol. 2003; 160: 487-493Crossref PubMed Scopus (235) Google Scholar). Furthermore, cAMP is known to control cell spreading, which is thus far thought to be mediated by PKA (18Dormond O. Bezzi M. Mariotti A. Ruegg C. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 45838-45846Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar). Although cAMP has previously been shown to regulate specific integrin functions on Ln-5 in a PKA-dependent manner, the involvement of the Epac-Rap1 pathway has not been appreciated in these studies. Therefore, the goal of this research was to test the role of the cAMP-Epac-Rap1 pathway in the regulation of adhesion to Ln-5. Furthermore, because α3β1 and α6β4 are regulated by two separate mechanisms, close investigation of Rap1-mediated adhesion to Ln-5 provides an excellent opportunity to gain more insight into how Rap1 may regulate integrins in general. Here we present evidence that cAMP acts as an upstream regulator of cell adhesion and cell spreading to Ln-5 through an Epac-Rap1-dependent pathway. Importantly, we found that although both α3β1 and α6β4 mediate adhesion to Ln-5, only α3β1-dependent adhesion is dependent on Rap1, showing that Rap1 specifically regulates α3β1 and not α6β4. This suggests that Rap1 exclusively regulates factors that couple to the actin cytoskeleton, without affecting the intermediate filament cytoskeleton. In addition, these results define different roles for the laminin-binding integrins in cAMP-regulated cell adhesion and subsequent cell spreading.

Briefly, as indicated, transfected or untransfected adherent cells were trypsinized and recovered in serum-free DMEM containing 20 mm Hepes, pH 7.4, and 1% fatty acid-free BSA for 1.5 h at 37 °C while rocking gently, to allow re-expression of cell surface markers. Serum-starved K562 cells, which grow in suspension, were not trypsinized but centrifuged and resuspended at a concentration of 1 × 106 cells ml-1 and rolled gently at 37 °C for 1 h. In studies with H-89 (10 μm), the cells were preincubated with the inhibitor during the final 40 min of the recovery period, whereas stimuli like forskolin, 8CPT-2Me-cAMP, isoproterenol, and PMA were added during the final 10 min of the recovery period. After the recovery period, the cells (2.5 × 104/well for 24-well plates and 10 × 104/well for 6-well plates in case of adherent cells; 5 × 105 cells/well of 96-well plates (Nunc Maxisorp) in the case of K562 cells) were directly transferred to plates. The cells were allowed to adhere at 37 °C for either 10 min or as indicated otherwise. Subsequently, the nonadherent cells were removed by washing gently but extensively with wash buffer (PBS with 1.8 mm CaCl2 and 2 mm MgCl2) five times. The cells were then lysed in luciferase lysis buffer (15% glycerol, 25 mm Tris-phosphate, pH 7.8, Triton X-100 1%, 8 mm MgCl2, 1 mm dithiothreitol), and luciferase activity (light units) was quantified with the addition of an equal volume of luciferase assay buffer (25 mm Tris-phosphate, pH 7.8, 8 mm MgCl2, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 1 mm ATP, 1 mm luciferin) using a luminometer. Unseeded cells were also measured to determine luciferase activity in the total input of cells. Expression of transfected cDNAs was confirmed by Western blotting. Specific adhesion (%) was determined (light units in cells bound/light units in total input × 100) and plotted relative to the basal adhesion of untreated, HA vector-transfected cells. Alternatively, cell adhesion was measured as follows. After washing the tissue culture plates with PBS, the cells were fixed in 4% formaldehyde in PBS for 30 min at 4 °C. The cells were then permeabilized and blocked in ice-cold TBST (50 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, 0.5% Triton X-100, 100 mm glycine, and 1% fatty acid-free BSA) for 30 min. Subsequently, the cells were incubated with phalloidin-TRITC overnight at 4 °C, washed with TBST, mounted in fluorescence mounting medium (DAKO), and photographed at 100× magnification using a CCD camera mounted on an inverted fluorescence microscope (Olympus IX 81, fitted for tissue culture dishes), after which the cells were counted directly. Cell Spreading Assay—As indicated, the cells were not transfected or transfected with cDNAs for Rap1GAPI or Rap1V12. GFP was co-transfected to visualize transfected cells. After 24 h, the cells were trypsinized and recovered in serum-free DMEM containing 20 mm Hepes, pH 7.4, and 1% fatty acid-free BSA for 2 h at 37 °C while rocking gently, to allow re-expression of cell surface markers. In studies with H-89 (10 μm) or function-blocking antibodies, the cells were preincubated during the final 40 min of the recovery period, whereas stimuli like forskolin, 8CPT-2Me-cAMP, and isoproterenol were added during the final 10 min of the recovery period. The cells (2.5 × 104/well in case of 24-well plates) were then directly transferred to plates and allowed to adhere at 37 °C on Ln-5 (15 min) or fibronectin (30 min), and the experiments were carried out in triplicate. After washing the tissue plates with PBS, the cells were fixed in 4% formaldehyde in PBS for 30 min at 4 °C. The cells were then permeabilized and blocked in ice-cold TBST (50 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, 0.5% Triton X-100, 100 mm glycine, and 1% fatty acid-free BSA) for 30 min. Subsequently, the cells were incubated with phalloidin-TRITC overnight at 4 °C, washed with TBST, mounted in fluorescence mounting medium (DAKO), and imaged at 400× magnification using a cooled CD camera mounted on an inverted fluorescence microscope (Olympus IX 81) fitted for tissue culture dishes. The total surface covered by cells (at least 33 cells/well, and a total of 3 wells/transfection) was plotted relative to the surface covered by untreated cells. The error bars represent average deviation among experiments. Alternatively, and as indicated in the figure legends, the percentage of spread cells (i.e. cells that had become flattened with their total diameter more than twice the diameter of the nucleus) per microscopic field (four different fields/treatment) was determined rather than the total cell surface. Fluorescence-activated Cell Sorter Analysis—Ovcar-3 cells were grown to ∼70% confluency, trypsinized, and recovered in serum-free DMEM containing 20 mm Hepes, pH 7.4, and 1% fatty acid-free BSA for 2 h at 37 °C while rocking gently. During the last 30 min the cells were treated with 100 μm 8CPT-2Me-cAMP or left untreated. Subsequently, the cells were washed with PBS, fixed in 4% formaldehyde in PBS for 30 min at 4 °C, washed with PBS, and incubated with 10 μl of fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated antibodies against α3 integrin (CD49c; Chemicon). Rap1 Activation Assay and Phosphorylation of CREB—Rap1 activation assays were performed as described previously (25Franke B. Akkerman J.W. Bos J.L. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 252-259Crossref PubMed Scopus (367) Google Scholar, 26van Triest M. de Rooij J. Bos J.L. Methods Enzymol. 2001; 333: 343-348Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). Briefly, adherent cells were stimulated as indicated and lysed in 750 μl of lysis buffer (10% glycerol, 1% Nonidet P-40, 50 mm Tris-Cl, pH 7.5, 200 mm NaCl, 2 mm MgCl2, 5 mm NaF, 1 mm NaVO3, and 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride). The lysates were clarified by centrifugation, and 500 μl of lysate was incubated with GST-tagged RBD of RalGDS precoupled to glutathione beads to specifically pull down the GTP-bound forms of Rap1. The samples were incubated for 1 h at 4 °C while tumbling. The beads were washed four times in lysis buffer, and the remaining fluid was removed with an insulin syringe. The proteins were eluted with Laemmli sample buffer and analyzed by SDS-PAGE and Western blotting using Rap1 antibodies. To 100 μl of clarified lysate 30 μl of 4× Laemmli sample buffer was added, and phosphorylation of CREB was analyzed by Western blotting using a phospho-specific antibody directed against phosphorylated Ser133. Rap1 Induces Adhesion to Ln-5—To investigate whether Rap1 is able to induce adhesion to Ln-5, we used 804G rat bladder carcinoma cells, which are known to adhere to Ln-5 (27Baker S.E. Hopkinson S.B. Fitchmun M. Andreason G.L. Frasier F. Plopper G. Quaranta V. Jones J.C. J. Cell Sci. 1996; 109: 2509-2520Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The cells were transfected with luciferase cDNA under control of a CMV promoter in combination with either Rap1V12, an activated mutant of Rap1 that is preferentially GTP-bound, or with Rap1GAPI, an inhibitor of Rap1. After detachment with trypsin-EDTA, the cells were plated on a Ln-5 matrix, and adhesion was quantified. As shown in Fig. 1A, Rap1V12 promoted adhesion of cells to Ln-5, whereas transfection with Rap1GAPI had no stimulatory effect. Expression of Rap1V12 and RapGAPI is shown in Fig. 1B. To test whether activation of endogenous Rap1 also induces adhesion of cells to Ln-5, we transiently transfected HaCaT keratinocyte cells, which also express α3β1 and α6β4, and 804G cells with the exchange factor Epac1, a specific activator of the family of Rap small GTPases that does not activate any other small GTPase (12Kawasaki H.

Transient transfection of cells with Epac1 cDNA has been shown previously to activate endogenous Rap1, even in the absence of stimuli that raise intracellular cAMP levels (17Rangarajan S. Enserink J.M. Kuiperij H.B. de Rooij J. Price L.S. Schwede F. Bos J.L. J. Cell Biol. 2003; 160: 487-493Crossref PubMed Scopus (235) Google Scholar, 28de Rooij J. Rehmann H. van Triest M. Cool R.H.

As shown in Fig. 1C, Epac1-expressing cells adhered better to a Ln-5 matrix than mock transfected cells. Activation of endogenous Rap1 and expression of Epac1 is shown in Fig. 1D. PDZ-GEFI is another exchange factor that does not activate any other small GTPase than the GTPases of the Rap family (20de Rooij J. Boenink N.M. van Triest M. Cool R.H. Wittinghofer A. Bos J.L. J.

Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2003; 1593: 141-149Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). Overexpression of PDZ-GEF in 804G cells also increased adhesion to Ln-5, whereas Rap1GAPI had a slight inhibitory effect (Fig. 1E). Activation of endogenous Rap1 and expression of the transgenes is shown in Fig. 1F. Interestingly, HEK293T cells, which only express α3β1 and not α6β4, also adhered better to Ln-5 upon overexpression of Epac1 (Fig. 1G), which was inhibited by co-expression of the inhibitor of Rap1, Rap1GAPI. Rap1-GTP levels are shown in Fig. 1H. Taken together, these results show that activation of endogenous Rap1 results in stimulation of cell adhesion to Ln-5 in a variety of cell lines and indicate that Rap1 may specifically regulate α3β1. cAMP Promotes Cell Adhesion to Ln-5 through Epac—Cyclic AMP is a versatile second messenger implicated in numerous cellular processes, many of which are believed to be carried out by PKA. However, some of the effects of cAMP have been shown to be mediated by the Epac1 signaling pathway rather than the PKA pathway, like calcium release, insulin secretion, and secretion of soluble amyloid precursor protein α (sAPPα), the major component of senile plaques in patient brains inflicted with Alzheimer's disease (30Kang G. Joseph J.W. Chepurny O.G. Monaco M. Wheeler M.B. Bos J.L. Schwede F. Genieser H.G. Holz G.G. J. Biol.

Cell Biol. 2001; 3: 1020-1024Crossref PubMed Scopus (282) Google Scholar). In addition, cAMP has recently been reported to induce adhesion of Ovcar-3 cells to fibronectin (FN) through the Epac-Rap1 pathway (17Rangarajan S. Enserink J.M. Kuiperij H.B. de Rooij J. Price L.S. Schwede F. Bos J.L. J. Cell Biol. 2003; 160: 487-493Crossref PubMed Scopus (235) Google Scholar). Ovcar-3 cells originate from a human ovarian carcinoma and have been reported to express both α3β1 and α6β4 and to adhere to laminins (33Bottini C. Miotti S. Fiorucci S. Facheris P. Menard S. Colnaghi M.I. Int. J. Cancer. 1993; 54: 261-267Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). All this makes the Ovcar-3 cell line an ideal cell line to study the role of cAMP in adhesion of cells to Ln-5. As shown in Fig. 2A, treatment of Ovcar-3 cells with the cAMP-elevating agent forskolin, a direct activator of adenylate cyclase, resulted in increased adhesion to Ln-5, which was resistant to the PKA inhibitor H-89. Importantly, treatment with isoproterenol, an agonist of the Gαs-coupled β2-adrenergic receptor, also resulted in increased cell adhesion (Fig. 2A), indicating that physiologically relevant stimuli also regulate adhesion to Ln-5. The finding that cAMP-induced cell adhesion was resistant to H-89 indicates that the effect of cAMP on cell adhesion is mediated by the Epac pathway rather than the PKA pathway. Therefore, we made use of a recently described Epac-specific cAMP analog, 8CPT-2Me-cAMP, which does not activate PKA even at high concentrations or long incubation times (21Enserink J.M. Christensen A.E. de Rooij J. van Triest M. Schwede F. Genieser H.G. Doskeland S.O. Blank J.L. Bos J.L. Nat. Cell Biol. 2002; 4: 901-906Crossref PubMed Scopus (618) Google Scholar). 8CPT-2Me-cAMP has previously been used to rapidly and very specifically “switch on” the endogenous Epac-Rap1 pathway and has been established as a tool for studying Epac signaling in a wide range of cellular processes (17Rangarajan S.

Rorsman P. J. Gen. Physiol. 2003; 121: 181-197Crossref PubMed Scopus (217) Google Scholar). As shown in Fig. 2B (top panel), 8CPT-2Me-cAMP rapidly activates Rap1 in Ovcar-3 cells, which is not affected by H-89, confirming that cAMP-induced Rap1 activation is mediated by the Epac pathway. The same results were obtained with forskolin and isoproterenol (Fig. 2B, top panel). As a control, phosphorylation of CREB, a direct target of PKA (37Gonzalez G.A. Montminy M.R. Cell. 1989; 59: 675-680Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2064) Google Scholar), was not affected by 8CPT-2Me-cAMP, whereas forskolin and isoproterenol clearly induced PKA-dependent phosphorylation of CREB (Fig. 2B, bottom panel). Equal loading was confirmed by probing total cell lysates with Rap1 antibodies (Fig. 2B, middle panel). Importantly, as observed for forskolin and isoproterenol, stimulation of Ovcar-3 cells with 8CPT-2Me-cAMP resulted in increased adhesion to Ln-5 (Fig. 2C), indicating the involvement of the Epac-Rap1 pathway. To confirm whether cAMP-induced cell adhesion to Ln-5 is indeed mediated by Rap1, we transfected cells with Rap1GAPI and performed an adhesion assay. As shown in Fig. 2D, overexpression of Rap1GAPI completely blocks forskolin-induced cell adhesion. Finally, we observed that Ovcar-3 cells undergo extensive cytoskeletal rearrangements upon treatment with forskolin, resulting in increased cell spreading (see Fig. 4 below). To test whether the increase in cell spreading is actually required for augmented cell adhesion, we performed an adhesion assay in which cells were only allowed to adhere for 5 min to an Ln-5 matrix. At this short time interval, forskolin-treated Ovcar-3 cells already adhered better to a Ln-5 matrix than untreated cells (Fig. 2E, left panel). The forskolin-treated cells were still round at this time point, without having undergone the large cytoskeletal changes that result in cell spreading (Fig. 2E, right panel). The fact that the rapid forskolin-induced increase in cell adhesion precedes the increase in cell spreading suggests that extensive cytoskeletal rearrangements are not required for Rap1-induced augmented cell adhesion. This view is in line with previous reports that Rap1 can regulate integrin affinity and avidity (16Kinbara K. Goldfinger L.E. Hansen M. Chou F.L. Ginsberg M.H. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2003; 4: 767-776Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Taken together, these results show that cAMP induces rapid, Epac-Rap1-dependent cell adhesion of Ovcar-3 cells to Ln-5.Fig. 4cAMP promotes cell spreading through Epac and Rap1. A, 804G cells were transiently transfected with mock DNA, Rap1V12, or Rap1GAPI. GFP was co-transfected to visualize transfected cells.

We report here that the two HSP90 isoforms, α and β, also localize on the surface of cells in the nervous system and are involved in their migration. A 94-kDa surface antigen, the 4C5 antigen, which was previously shown to be involved in migration processes during development of the nervous system, is shown to be identical to HSP90α using mass spectrometry analysis. This identity is further confirmed by immunoprecipitation experiments and by induction of 4C5 antigen expression in heat shock-treated embryonic rat brain cultures. Moreover, immunocytochemistry on live cerebellar rat cells reveals cell surface localization of both HSP90α and -β. Cell migration from cerebellar and sciatic nerve explants is inhibited by anti-HSP90α and anti-HSP90β antibodies, similarly to the inhibition observed with monoclonal antibody 4C5. Moreover, immunostaining with rhodamine-phalloidin of migrating Schwann cells cultured in the presence of antibodies against both α and β isoforms of HSP90 reveals that HSP90 activity is associated with actin cytoskeletal organization, necessary for lamellipodia formation.

The development of the vertebrate nervous system depends on extensive cell migration, which allows different cell types to reach their final destination and establish the composite organization of the adult nervous system. Cell migration is a complex process, which requires the coordination of many molecular and cellular events such as cell-cell recognition, adhesion, transmembrane signaling, and cell motility (1Anton E.S.

Emerging evidence suggests that many proteins in the nervous system have multiple distinct functions. Thus, molecules involved in migration processes have been shown to participate additionally in other developmental events. These include the cell adhesion molecules (CAMs), which regulate axonal growth and regeneration (25Walsh F.S. Doherty P. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1996; 8: 707-713Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar); integrins, which mediate cell proliferation and synaptic plasticity (26Milner R. Campbell I.L. J. Neurosci. Res. 2002; 69: 286-291Crossref PubMed Scopus (184) Google Scholar); and neuregulins that promote neuronal differentiation and regulate glial commitment, proliferation, survival, and differentiation (27Buonanno A.

We report here that heat shock protein 90 (HSP90) 1The abbreviations used are: HSP, heat shock protein; FPLC, fast performance liquid chromatography; HPLC, high performance liquid chromatography; MS, mass spectrometry; NF, neurofilament; mAb, monoclonal antibody; FCS, fetal calf serum; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline; NCAM, neural cell adhesion molecule. is also a multifunctional protein, processing a novel role in neuronal migration. HSP90 is a highly conserved molecule with a wide distribution in various species. It acts as capacitor of morphological evolution in Drosophila melanogaster (28Rutherford S.L. Lindquist S.

Garfinkel M.D. Ruden D.M. Nat. Genet. 2003; 33: 70-74Crossref PubMed Scopus (332) Google Scholar). It also functions as a chaperone in unstressed cells, specifically involved in the folding or conformational regulation of central signal transduction molecules, including steroid hormone receptors and proto-oncogene kinases (31Pratt W.B. Annu. Rev. Pharmacol. Toxicol. 1997; 37: 297-326Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 32Wegele H. Muller L. Buchner J. Rev. Physiol. Biochem.

Moreover, it is a protective agent under stress conditions and is involved in protein renaturation and refolding (33Rutherford S.L. Zuker C.S. Cell. 1994; 79: 1129-1132Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (171) Google Scholar). In the developing mammalian nervous system, HSP90 is highly expressed in the G0 phase of cells during neuroectoderm differentiation, suggesting that it is required in order to maintain cells in this phase (34Walsh D. Li Z. Wu Y. Nagata K. Cell Mol. Life Sci. 1997; 53: 198-211Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). Moreover, Loones et al. (35Loones M.T. Chang Y. Morange M. Cell Stress Chaperones. 2000; 5: 291-305Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar) have reported the differential expression of HSP90 in various regions of the developing nervous system, suggesting involvement of this molecule in specific functions distinct from its chaperone activity. Two isoforms of HSP90 exist, α and β, which share 86% amino acid sequence conservation. However, no isoform-specific functions have so far been attributed to these molecules. In order to understand the molecular events regulating neuronal migration and development, we have previously characterized a monoclonal antibody (mAb), named 4C5, which was produced after immunization of mice with a brain membrane fraction of 15-day-old rat embryos. As judged by immunoblotting and immunocytochemistry, this antibody recognizes a 94-kDa cell surface peripheral antigen (4C5 antigen) in the developing rat nervous system (36Thomaidou D. Patsavoudi E. Neuroscience. 1993; 53: 813-827Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). In the central nervous system, the 4C5 antigen is present in neurons, and its expression is decreased with age (36Thomaidou D. Patsavoudi E. Neuroscience. 1993; 53: 813-827Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar, 37Thomaidou D. Dori I. Patsavoudi E. J. Neurochem. 1995; 64: 1937-1944Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar). Moreover, antibody perturbation experiments, performed in cerebellar explant cultures using mAb 4C5, have indicated that the 4C5 antigen contributes to both the horizontal and the vertical neuron-neuron-mediated migrations of granule cells during cerebellar development (37Thomaidou D. Dori I. Patsavoudi E. J. Neurochem. 1995; 64: 1937-1944Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar, 38Yfanti E. Nagata I. Patsavoudi E. J. Neurochem. 1998; 71: 1381-1389Crossref PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar). In the peripheral nervous system and in particular in the rat sciatic nerve, the presence of the 4C5 antigen was detected not only in neurons but also in myelin-forming and non-myelinforming Schwann cells (39Thomaidou D. Yfanti E. Patsavoudi E. J. Neurosci. Res. 1996; 46: 24-33Crossref PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar). Western blot analysis showed that mAb 4C5 recognizes in the sciatic nerve a protein of the same molecular mass as in the brain (39Thomaidou D. Yfanti E. Patsavoudi E. J. Neurosci. Res. 1996; 46: 24-33Crossref PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar). Expression of the 4C5 antigen decreases with age in both myelin-forming and nonmyelin-forming Schwann cells, thus indicating its involvement in a developmental process common to all Schwann cells. Moreover, following adult sciatic nerve crush, the molecule was intensely re-expressed in Schwann cells of the distal segment, a few days after injury and during regeneration of the nerve. Antibody perturbation experiments performed in various in vitro systems of the peripheral nervous system using mAb 4C5 indicated that the 4C5 antigen participates in Schwann cell migration events during development and regeneration of the peripheral nervous system (40Yfanti E. Sidera K. Margaritis L.H. Patsavoudi E. Glia. 2004; 45: 39-53Crossref PubMed Scopus (7) Google Scholar). Finally, data have been presented suggesting the involvement of this protein in actin cytoskeletal dynamics of migrating Schwann cells (40Yfanti E. Sidera K. Margaritis L.H. Patsavoudi E. Glia. 2004; 45: 39-53Crossref PubMed Scopus (7) Google Scholar). In the present work, we show, using a proteomic approach, that the mAb 4C5 recognizes HSP90. Moreover, we demonstrate that the expression of the 4C5 antigen/HSP90 is induced in primary cell cultures derived from rat embryonic brain after heat shock treatment of these cultures. Finally, with the use of polyclonal antibodies against both HSP90 isoforms, we show that these proteins are localized not only in the cytoplasm but also on the cell surface of cells and furthermore that they are involved in cell migration processes in the developing central and peripheral nervous system. Antibodies and Reagents—mAb 4C5 was produced in our laboratory, as previously described (36Thomaidou D. Patsavoudi E. Neuroscience. 1993; 53: 813-827Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). In the present study, mAb 4C5 was used as concentrated serum-free supernatant in all experiments performed. Rabbit anti-HSP90α and anti-HSP90β were from Chemicon International. Rabbit antibody against BM88, a neuron-specific protein (41Mamalaki A. Boutou E. Hurel C. Patsavoudi E. Tzartos S. Matsas R. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 14201-14208Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar), was kindly provided by Dr. Matsas (Hellenic Pasteur Institute). Rabbit anti-NCAM was a kind gift from Dr. Rougon (CNRS/IBDM Marsaille). Mouse monoclonal antibody to the cytoskeletal neurofilament (NF) protein, secondary polyclonal fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated antibodies, rhodamine-conjugated phalloidin, fetal calf serum (FCS), poly-l-lysine, laminin, trypsin, diaminobenzidine tetrahydrochloride, and 5-bromo-2′-deoxyuridine were purchased from Sigma. Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (DMEM), Ham's F-12 medium, and Ca2+/Mg2+-free minimum essential medium were obtained from Invitrogen. The anti-mouse IgG-specific ABC complex was obtained from Vector. Brain Preparations—Embryonic day 18 brain extracts were homogenized in at least 10 times their volume of 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, in a glass homogenizer on ice. This was centrifuged at 500 × g for 5 min, the pellet was discarded, and the supernatant was treated with 1 m NaCl for 20 min in 10 mm Tris buffer, followed by centrifugation at 15,000 × g for 30 min. The pellet was discarded, and the supernatant was dialyzed in 20 mm Tris, pH 7.8, for 48 h. Protein estimations were performed using the Bradford method. Two-dimensional Electrophoresis, Western Blot, and Mass Spectrometry—The above described brain preparations were separated on a MonoQ column using a fast protein liquid chromatography (FPLC) system (Amersham Biosciences). The column was developed with a linear gradient to 1 m NaCl. Fractions were collected and analyzed by 12% SDS-PAGE followed by Western blotting with mAb 4C5 performed as previously described (36Thomaidou D. Patsavoudi E. Neuroscience. 1993; 53: 813-827Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). The immunoreactive fractions were then separated in duplicate two-dimensional gels, with isoelectric focusing as the first dimension (IPG strips; nonlinear pI range 3–10; Amersham Biosciences) and SDS-PAGE (12%) as the second. This was followed by silver staining of one gel and immunoblotting with mAb 4C5 of the other. The spot from the silver-stained gel corresponding to the immunoreactive spot was cut, and after overnight in-gel digestion with sequence grade trypsin (Promega), peptides were extracted from the gel, and a peptide preparation in 2% acetonitrile, 0.1% formic acid was applied to a C-18 reversed-phase high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) column (75 μm × 15 cm) on an UltiMate nano-HPLC system (LC Packings; Dionex). The column was developed with a linear gradient to 90% acetonitrile, 0.1% formic acid at a flow rate of 150 nl/min. The eluate was analyzed on an ion trap mass spectrometer with a nanospray source (LCQ Deca; ThermoFinnigan). MS and MS/MS data were used to search protein data bases (SwissProt) with the Turbo-SEQUEST search engine. Immunoprecipitation—For immunoprecipitation, the 4C5-immunoreactive fraction derived from FPLC separation was incubated either with anti-HSP90α or with anti-HSP90β. In particular, 100 μl of the fraction were incubated with 5 μl of anti-HSP90α and anti-HSP90β, respectively, coupled to Protein A-Sepharose beads, for 1 h at room temperature. For controls, the 4C5-immunoreactive fraction was incubated with 5 μl of anti-rabbit immunoglobulins coupled to Protein A-Sepharose beads. Samples were mixed for 1 h, and beads were washed three times in PBS. Proteins were eluted from the beads by boiling in sample buffer and analyzed by SDS-PAGE and immunoblotting using mAb 4C5. Cell Cultures and Heat Shock Treatment—Primary cell cultures from embryonic day 18 rat brain were prepared as previously reported (42Patsavoudi E. Hurel C. Matsas R. Neuroscience. 1989; 30: 463-478Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). Briefly, the brain was aseptically removed from the embryos, dissected, and treated for 45 min at 37 °C with 0.25% trypsin in 10 ml of Ca2+/Mg2+-free minimum essential medium. The digestion was terminated with the addition of 20% FCS, and the cells were dissociated by trituration and passage through a nylon mesh (60 μm). Resulting cells were centrifuged at 500 × g for 10 min, resuspended in DMEM supplemented with 10% FCS culture medium and plated (3.5 × 105 cells/well) on 10-mm diameter glass coverslips, precoated with 1 mg/ml poly-l-lysine in 48-well Costar culture dishes. The dishes were placed in an incubator at 37 °C with a humidified atmosphere of 5% CO2 and 95% air. After 48 h in cultures, cells were heat-shocked for 1 h in a water bath preheated to 43 °C followed by another 24 h in vitro before immunostaining. Controls were maintained in the incubator. Cerebellar primary cell cultures from postnatal day 5 rats were prepared as previously described (37Thomaidou D. Dori I. Patsavoudi E. J. Neurochem. 1995; 64: 1937-1944Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar). In Vitro Migration Assays—In the two bioassays used, control cultures were grown either in culture medium alone (DMEM, 10% FCS) or in culture medium containing 100 μg/ml polyclonal antibody against BM88. Cerebellar Microexplants—Cerebellum obtained from postnatal day 5 rats was quickly removed from the skull, placed in cold DMEM, and freed from meninges and choroids plexus. The cerebellum was then cut in slices from which rectangular pieces (50–100 μm) were dissected using a surgical blade under a stereoscope. Such prepared microexplants were placed on precoated coverslips with 0.1% mg/ml poly-l-lysine and 20 μg/ml laminin with 100 μl of DMEM, 10% FCS in the presence of 100 μg/ml of anti-HSP90α and anti-HSP90β, respectively, or in control media. After 36 h of culture, granule cells migrating out of the tissue were observed, as identified by peroxidase immunostaining using antibody to the NF protein. Sciatic Nerve Explants—Sciatic nerves were aseptically dissected from postnatal day 1 Wistar rats, and the perineurium was removed. Small pieces, ∼2 mm long, of the nerves were placed on poly-l-lysinecoated glass coverslips and cultured in DMEM, 10% FCS in the presence of 100 μg/ml anti-HSP90α and anti-HSP90β, respectively, or in control media. After 36 h of culture, Schwann cells migrating out of the tissue were observed, as identified by immunochemistry using antibody to S-100 protein. Immunostaining—Immunolabeling of embryonic day 18 brain cultures for the 4C5 antigen and NF protein was performed by the immunoperoxidase method. The preparations were fixed in 4% (w/v) paraformaldehyde in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) for 20 min and washed three times in PBS. For demonstration of intracellular antigens, the samples were permeabilized with 0.1% Triton X-100. Antibodies were diluted in PBS containing 10% FCS and 0.1 m lysine. The samples were incubated overnight at 4 °C with the primary antibodies, followed by incubation with the anti-mouse IgG-specific ABC complex. Immunoreactivity was visualized using diaminobenzidine tetrahydrochloride as a substrate with nickel enhancement. The stained preparations were mounted on glass slides in glycerol. Live cells from primary cerebellar cultures were labeled by indirect immunofluorescence as previously reported (36Thomaidou D. Patsavoudi E. Neuroscience. 1993; 53: 813-827Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). Briefly, unfixed cells were incubated with mAb 4C5, anti-HSP90α, anti-HSP90β, anti-NCAM, and anti-NF, diluted in culture medium for 2 h. The cells were then washed in DMEM and fixed in cold acetone for 3 min. Secondary antibodies were fluorescein-conjugated anti-mouse or anti-rabbit immunoglobulins, diluted 1:50 in PBS containing 10% FCS and 0.1 m lysine. Immunolabeling of sciatic nerve explants for the S-100 protein was performed by the immunofluorescence method as previously described (38Yfanti E. Nagata I. Patsavoudi E. J. Neurochem. 1998; 71: 1381-1389Crossref PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar). Briefly, the preparations were fixed in 4% (w/v) paraformaldehyde in PBS for 20 min and washed three times in PBS. Antibodies were diluted in PBS containing 10% FCS and 0.1 m lysine. The samples were incubated overnight at 4 °C with the primary antibody, followed by incubation with fluorescence-conjugated secondary antibody (anti-rabbit Fab fragments conjugated to fluorescein isothiocyanate, at a dilution of 1:100). For detection of actin filaments of sciatic nerve explants, the cells were fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde in PBS, permeabilized with 0.1% Triton X-100 in PBS in order to increase phalloid penetration, rinsed twice with PBS, and incubated for 20 min at room temperature with rhodamine-conjugated phalloidin diluted in the same buffer. The stained preparations were mounted on glass slides in CITIFLUOR (CITIFLUOR Ltd.) to prevent fading of the fluorescence. For all experiments, controls were performed by omitting the primary antibodies. All preparations were viewed by a Zeiss microscope. Quantification of Immunofluorescence—For quantifying the extent of lamellipodia formation, images of Schwann cells labeled with rhodamine-phalloidin were collected using a Leica DM 300 camera connected to a computer. The extent of labeled areas was measured with the help of Image Pro Plus analysis software. Statistical Analysis—In all of the experimental groups that were statistically analyzed for differences, Student's t test was used, in which p < 0.05 was defined as statistically significant. Identification of the 4C5 Antigen as the HSP90 Protein—The functional properties of mAb 4C5 led us to believe that it recognizes an important molecule for cell migration, and we therefore set out to establish its identity. We prepared homogenates from rat embryonic brain and carried out a partial purification of the 4C5 antigen by anion exchange FPLC on a MonoQ column. All fractions were assayed by immunoblotting with mAb 4C5, revealing a peak of the 94-kDa antigen eluting at ∼400 mm NaCl. A major band of 94 kDa was present in a silver-stained gel of the three peak fractions, correlating in intensity with that of the immunoreactive band. 2K. Sidera, M. Samiotaki, E. Yfanti, G. Panayotou, and E. Patsavoudi, unpublished data. However, the presence of possible contaminating bands in the complex mixture led us to a further purification using two-dimensional electrophoresis. The MonoQ fraction containing most of the immunoreactive material was separated in two parallel two dimensional gels, one of which was silver-stained and the other processed for immunoblotting with mAb 4C5. The protein spot that reacted with the antibody was identified and cut from the duplicate gel stained with silver (Fig. 1A). Following in-gel digestion with trypsin, peptides were extracted and separated on a reversed phase C18 nano-HPLC column, coupled to an ion trap mass spectrometer with a nanospray source. Tandem MS data were collected for the entire digest and used to search protein databases. The immunoreactive protein spot was clearly identified as HSP90α (Fig. 1, B and C). Approximately 30 peptides were matched, covering 51.4% of the protein by sequence (Fig. 1D). The same result was obtained with material extracted from the one-dimensional separation of the immunoreactive fractions. 2K. Sidera, M. Samiotaki, E. Yfanti, G. Panayotou, and E. Patsavoudi, unpublished data. No other protein gave a significant match. In order to confirm the above result, we employed specific polyclonal antibodies raised against both isoforms of HSP90, α and β. Western blot analysis of the 4C5 immunoreactive fraction derived from the FPLC separation with mAb 4C5, anti-HSP90α, and anti-HSP90β revealed in all cases a single immunoreactive band (Fig. 1E, lanes 1–3, respectively). The 4C5-immunoreactive fraction derived from the FPLC separation was then incubated with polyclonal anti-HSP90α or -β coupled to protein A beads, and the immunoprecipitated proteins were immunoblotted with mAb 4C5. Whereas in both cases, a single immunoreactive band was observed, the intensity of the band obtained after anti-HSP90α immunoprecipitation was much more intense than that obtained for the β isoform (Fig. 1E, lanes 4 and 5). The two isoforms are closely related in amino acid sequence (86% conservation), and it is therefore not surprising that some cross-reactivity is observed. No bands were observed in controls where protein A beads were incubated with anti-rabbit immunoglobulins and followed by immunoblotting with mAb 4C5 (Fig. 1E, lane 6). The possibility that the commercial anti-HSP90 antibodies and mAb 4C5 recognize two different proteins that interact strongly with each other and have the same molecular weight is highly unlikely given their co-migration in two-dimensional electrophoresis, as shown above. We conclude from these results that the 4C5 antigen and HSP90 are most probably one and the same molecule. Cell Surface and Intracellular 4C5 Antigen/HSP90 Are Induced by Heat Shock—Our identification of HSP90 as the antigen most likely recognized by mAb 4C5 led us to investigate whether expression of this antigen is induced by heat shock. To this end, cells from embryonic day 18 rat brain were immunolabeled with mAb 4C5 either prior to or following heat shock treatment and in the absence or presence of Triton X-100 to allow cell surface or intracellular labeling, respectively (Fig. 2A). In the absence of Triton X-100 or heat shock treatment, immunoreactivity was observed on cells morphologically identified as neurons (Fig. 2A, arrows). Immunostaining of astrocytes (Fig. 2A, arrowheads) was very weak, close to that obtained in controls where the primary antibody was omitted.2 When these cultures were treated with Triton X-100, a more intense immunolabeling was observed in both cell types (Fig. 2, A and B), indicating the predominantly intracellular localization of the protein in both neurons and astrocytes. Exposure of the cultures to heat shock resulted in a significant increase of 4C5 immunoreactivity both in neurons and astrocytes (Fig. 2, A and B). It is interesting to note that increased immunolabeling corresponded both to the cell surface (Fig. 2, A and B) and to the intracellular protein (Fig. 2, A and B) recognized by mAb 4C5. Finally, heat shock treatment of the cultures did not affect the immunostaining observed for the control neuronal NF protein.2 These results further confirm that the 4C5 antigen and HSP90 are identical. They also demonstrate that whereas HSP90 has a ubiquitous and predominant intracellular localization, in some cell types, such as neurons, it is also present in significant amounts at the cell surface, indicating potential novel roles in cellular function. Anti-HSP90α and Anti-HSP90β Stain the Cell Surface—Our previously published work has shown that the 4C5 antigen is expressed at the cell surface of neuronal cells. In order to confirm cell surface localization of HSP90, unfixed cells from rat cerebellum of postnatal day 5 were incubated after 3 h in culture with anti-HSP90α and anti-HSP90β. The cells were then carefully washed, fixed, and labeled with a fluorescent secondary antibody. Thus, the primary antibody had access only to the external surface of the cells. The observed typical punctate immunostaining confirmed the cell surface localization of both HSP90α and HSP90β isoforms (Fig. 3A). Interestingly, immunolabeling with anti-HSP90α was more intense than with anti-HSP90β; however, the observed difference was not significant (Fig. 3B). In accordance with our previous data, surface immunolabeling of cerebellar cells was also obtained with mAb 4C5 (Fig. 3A). Control experiments using antibodies to cell surface NCAM and to the intracellular NF protein resulted in positive and negative results, respectively (Fig. 3A). HSP90 Is Involved in Cell Migration in the Central and Peripheral Nervous System—HSP90 has not been associated before with cell migration processes during development of the nervous system. Our finding that this protein is the antigen recognized by mAb 4C5, which has been previously reported to be involved in migration processes in the central (37Thomaidou D. Dori I. Patsavoudi E. J.

Thus, we performed antibody perturbation experiments using anti-HSP90α and anti-HSP90β in two in vitro model systems for the central and peripheral nervous system.

Alternative splicing of primary gene transcripts provides a mechanism to generate functionally distinct protein isoforms from a single gene. For the development of safe and efficacious therapeutic compounds, it is necessary to identify the repertoire of proteins that can arise from a gene targeted for therapeutic intervention and determine their tissue distribution within the body. The completion of several mammalian genome sequences, coupled with rich resources provided by extensive expressed sequence tag (EST) and cDNA sequencing, present opportunities for computational prediction of alternative splicing (1Thanaraj T.A.

The UCSC genome browser (genome.ucsc.edu), which displays overlapping tracks of mRNAs, ESTs, and comparative genomic conservation, can also facilitate the identification of potential alternative splice events. DNA microarrays that monitor exon-exon junctions directly across a broad range of transcripts provide an additional resource to detect alternative splicing on a genome-wide scale (5Johnson J.M.

These combined computational and experimental approaches, coupled with traditional laboratory validation, provide a wealth of information about alternative splicing and tissue-specific expression, which are essential to define a drug target at the molecular level.Sodium channels are multisubunit protein complexes that play a pivotal role in the propagation of action potentials along neurons (7Catterall W.A. Neuron. 2000; 26: 13-25Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1685) Google Scholar, 8Yu F.H. Catterall W.A. Genome Biol. 2003; 4: 207Crossref PubMed Scopus (502) Google Scholar). The α-subunit genes encode the primary channel-forming pores within the cell membrane that allow ion-specific translocation. The α-subunit gene family contains nine paralogs (and one additional sodium channel-like gene, Nax) that are highly conserved across vertebrate species (9Goldin A.L. Barchi R.L. Caldwell J.H.

Neuron. 2000; 28: 365-368Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (649) Google Scholar). The channel protein structure includes four highly similar clusters of transmembrane helices that are connected by intracellular loops. A similar structure is found in calcium and potassium channels, indicating that this ion channel superfamily arose from a single primordial ion channel gene (8Yu F.H. Catterall W.A.

Voltage-gated sodium channels perform a broad spectrum of functions within vertebrate cells, as is evident from the large number of paralogous genes and their tissue-selective expression patterns. For a particular sodium channel gene, subtle differences in channel properties can be attributed to alternative splicing, post-translational modification, changes in the expression of ancillary β-subunits, and mutation (7Catterall W.A. Neuron. 2000; 26: 13-25Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1685) Google Scholar, 8Yu F.H. Catterall W.A. Genome Biol. 2003; 4: 207Crossref PubMed Scopus (502) Google Scholar). Importantly, alternative splicing of transcripts derived from a common gene has been shown to generate biochemically and pharmacologically distinct sodium channel isoforms (11Tan J. Liu Z. Nomura Y.

Modulation of DRG sodium channel activity may provide relief from neuropathic pain, a medical condition that is not well addressed by current medicinal therapies (13Waxman S.G. Cummins T.R.

Our goal was to catalog and quantify alternative splicing events that occur in SCN8A (encoding Nav1.6, PN4), SCN9A (encoding Nav 1.7, PN1), and SCN11A (encoding Nav 1.9, PN5). As an example, previous research had shown alternative splicing of SCN8A transcripts (14Plummer N.W. McBurney M.W. Meisler M.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 24008-24015Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar, 15Plummer N.W. Galt J. Jones J.M. Burgess D.L. Sprunger L.K. Kohrman D.C. Meisler M.H. Genomics. 1998; 54: 287-296Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). In rat DRG, alternative splicing extends the reading frame of exon 11, resulting in a channel that has altered kinetics of inactivation and reactivation relative to the non-extended isoform (12Dietrich P.S. McGivern J.G. Delgado S.G. Koch B.D. Eglen R.M. Hunter J.C. Sangameswaran L. J. Neurochem. 1998; 70: 2262-2272Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar). Developmentally regulated alternative splicing of SCN8A coding exon 18 in mouse and human results in a transcript that encodes a truncated, nonfunctional channel that appears in fetal tissue but vanishes just after birth (14Plummer N.W. McBurney M.W. Meisler M.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 24008-24015Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar). Finally, a splicing event involving a mutually exclusive alternative exon 6 was inferred from human genomic sequence (15Plummer N.W. Galt J. Jones J.M. Burgess D.L. Sprunger L.K. Kohrman D.C. Meisler M.H. Genomics. 1998; 54: 287-296Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). A recent report of DRG-selective expression of an alternatively spliced, functionally distinct variant of the voltage-gated calcium channel CACNA1B (Cav2.2) suggests that DRG-specific alternative splicing may generate a unique constellation of ion channels within this physiologically important PNS subregion (16Bell T.J. Thaler C. Castiglioni A.J. Helton T.D. Lipscombe D. Neuron. 2004; 41: 127-138Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (180) Google Scholar). In this study, we were able to detect both known and novel sodium channel transcripts in DRG that arise by alternative splicing. Quantitative PCR was used to assess the expression patterns of these alternatively spliced isoforms, and we found that alternative splicing of sodium channel mRNAs was most pronounced in DRG. These data indicate that effective treatment of neuropathic pain via antagonism of sodium channels must account for multiple channel isoforms.MATERIALS AND METHODSSodium Channel Expression Compendium (Body Atlas)—Gene expression profiling of cynomolgus monkey mRNA was performed on ink-jet synthesized oligonucleotide microarrays designed to monitor ∼47,000 human transcripts. This two-array set (Hu50K) is an updated version of human microarrays described previously (17Hughes T.R. Mao M. Jones A.R. Burchard J. Marton M.J. Shannon K.W. Lefkowitz S.M. Ziman M. Schelter J.M.

Biotechnol. 2001; 19: 342-347Crossref PubMed Scopus (1045) Google Scholar). Probes for the nine voltage-gated sodium channel transcripts reported here were present on these arrays. Additional results from these experiments will be described in future publications. Microarray probe sequences were designed to hybridize near the transcript 3′-end. Messenger RNA amplification and hybridization conditions were performed as described previously (17Hughes T.R. Mao M. Jones A.R. Burchard J. Marton M.J. Shannon K.W. Lefkowitz S.M. Ziman M. Schelter J.M. Meyer M.R. Kobayashi S. Davis C. Dai H. He Y.D. Stephaniants S.B. Cavet G. Walker W.L. West A. Coffey E. Shoemaker D.D. Stoughton R. Blanchard A.P. Friend S.H. Linsley P.S. Nat. Biotechnol. 2001; 19: 342-347Crossref PubMed Scopus (1045) Google Scholar). Individual samples were labeled with either fluorescent Cy3 or Cy5 dye and hybridized to a human microarray in replicate against a mass-balanced control pool of 220 individual tissue RNA samples. Each experiment was repeated with the Cy3 and Cy5 dyes reversed (a dye swap). Microarrays were purchased from Agilent Technologies (Palo Alto, CA). The housing, necropsy, and extraction of RNA from organs and tissues of all animals used in the monkey expression experiments was performed by MPI Research Inc. (Mattawan, MI), with the sole exception of RNA extraction from bone samples. Four cynomolgus (Macaca fascicularis) monkeys, 2 male and 2 female, were the source of the organs and tissues. All animals were matched for age, weight, and diet (Lab Diet® Certified Primate Diet 5048, PMI Nutrition International, Inc.) available ad libitum. Monkeys were fasted for 16 h pre-euthanasia and sedated with ketamine, followed by overdose of sodium pentobarbital solution and exsanguination. All samples were harvested, trimmed, and snap frozen in liquid nitrogen within 30 min with the majority of samples being frozen within 15 min.Each sample was hybridized to 8 microarrays: 4 individuals and 2 microarrays for the dye-swap. For each gene, a log10 ratio of individual sample to pool was generated by combining dye-swap microarray pairs. These 4 values, one for each individual, were then averaged in an error-weighted fashion (18He Y.D. Dai H. Schadt E.E. Cavet G. Edwards S.W. Stepaniants S.B. Duenwald S. Kleinhanz R. Jones A.R. Shoemaker D.D. Stoughton R.B. Bioinformatics. 2003; 19: 956-965Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar) to produce a log10 error-weighted average (tissue-to-pool) ratio for each gene. Error bars estimate the one standard deviation of this average combine the modeled errors calculated for each sample and the replicate error (18He Y.D. Dai H. Schadt E.E. Cavet G. Edwards S.W.

Bioinformatics. 2003; 19: 956-965Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar) Finally, for each gene, we transformed the log ratios to ratios and normalized linearly by scaling the largest tissue ratio to 1.RT-PCR and Quantitative Real Time PCR (TaqMan®)—Reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) amplification from tissue-specific mRNA or total RNA was performed as described previously (5Johnson J.M.

Total rat dorsal root ganglia RNA from control and treated animals from a spinal nerve ligation neuropathic pain model was obtained as a gift from Dr. Hao Wang and colleagues (Merck Research Labs, West Point, PA). All of the handling of the animals and testing was performed in accordance with the policies and recommendations of the International Association for the Study of Pain (19Zimmermann M. Pain. 1983; 16: 109-110Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (6802) Google Scholar) and received approval from the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee of MRL, West Point, PA.

Neuroscience. 2002; 114: 529-546Crossref PubMed Scopus (218) Google Scholar. RNA was converted to cDNA for TaqMan® measurements using a commercially available kit from Applied Biosystems. All assays were normalized on a tissue-to-tissue basis by adding a constant amount of input total RNA into the RT reaction. We chose this normalization method because we were unable to identify a single housekeeping gene that yielded satisfactory normalization data. Isoform levels within tissue RNAs were measured in triplicate on separate occasions, and the results were highly reproducible. A representative data set is shown in each case.Quantitative PCR values were calculated by assuming that the sum of splicing events at a given site was equal to unity (e.g. SCN8A [exon 6N] + [exon 6A] = 1). This was applied to the most abundant measurement in each data set (SCN8A-adult brain; SCN9A exon 5-DRG; SCN9A exon 11-fetal brain) where the sum of the isoform measurements was adjusted to a value of 100%. All other measurements in the data set were normalized to these maximum values. Error bars are 1 S.D. of the average of triplicate measurements.RESULTSBody Atlas Expression Patterns of Sodium Channels—DNA microarrays afford the opportunity for genome-wide monitoring of transcription within any RNA sample. When RNA samples from diverse tissues throughout the body are hybridized, it becomes possible to assemble a transcriptional compendium or Body Atlas (5Johnson J.M. Castle J. Garrett-Engele P. Kan Z.

This resource is essentially a semiquantitative, whole-genome Northern blot for all transcripts with corresponding probes on the array. The Body Atlas of the nine voltage-gated sodium channel paralogs across a broad range of tissues was obtained for cynomolgus macaque monkey transcripts profiled on human microarrays (Fig. 1). While entirely consistent with previous studies (7Catterall W.A. Neuron. 2000; 26: 13-25Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1685) Google Scholar, 8Yu F.H. Catterall W.A.

Neuron. 2000; 28: 365-368Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (649) Google Scholar), these data are unique in that they provide a comprehensive overview of the entire gene family in a wide range of tissues. We present the data for monkey because our data for human were incomplete. Moreover, we believe the cynomolgus macaque data are a more accurate reflection of normal human biology because tissue RNA samples were obtained from healthy individuals under carefully controlled conditions. Microarrays using human sequences have routinely and successfully been used to profile non-human primate samples to study gene expression, including the use of samples from cynomolgus monkey (23Miyahara T. Kikuchi T. Akimoto M. Kurokawa T. Shibuki H. Yoshimura N. Investig. Ophthalmol. Vis. Sci. 2003; 44: 4347-4356Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). There is a high level of conservation of orthologous sodium channel sequences and expression patterns among mammals that is likely even higher among primates. On average, one would expect zero to only a few mismatched bases between monkey and human per 60-mer probe sequence. Of the 10 sodium channel probes that could be mapped to both human and chimpanzee genomic sequences, seven were perfect matches in both species. Finally, although sequence differences between human and cynomolgus monkey transcripts may affect individual probe intensities, they are unlikely to influence intensity ratios (between sample and pool), which are used here. Examination of the Body Atlas data reveals that SCN4A (Nav1.4) and SCN5A (Nav1.5) exhibit strikingly selective expression in striated muscle and heart, respectively. SCN3A (Nav1.3) appears to be transcribed in numerous tissues. Channels SCN1A (Nav1.1), SCN2A (Nav1.2) and SCN8A (Nav1.6) appear to be abundantly expressed in both PNS and CNS tissues. In contrast, SCN9A (Nav1.7), SCN10A (Nav1.8) and SCN11A (Nav1.9) expression is strikingly selective to DRG, with only minor expression levels detected elsewhere in the body.Detection of Alternative Splicing in SCN8A, SCN9A, and SCN11A—Within the vertebrate sodium channel paralog family, parsimonious clustering by protein sequence indicates that SCN8A and SCN9A occupy one branch of the sodium channel family tree that also includes SCN1A, SCN2A, and SCN3A (8Yu F.H. Catterall W.A. Genome Biol. 2003; 4: 207Crossref PubMed Scopus (502) Google Scholar, 9Goldin A.L. Barchi R.L. Caldwell J.H. Hofmann F. Howe J.R. Hunter J.C. Kallen R.G. Mandel G. Meisler M.H.

As mentioned, within SCN8A, two alternative splicing events with the potential to produce functional sodium channels have been described. The first involves the potential use of mutually exclusive, alternative exon 6 (coding exon 5) sequences that encode parts of transmembrane segments S3 and S4 within domain I (Fig. 2 and Refs. 14Plummer N.W. McBurney M.W. Meisler M.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 24008-24015Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar and 15Plummer N.W. Galt J. Jones J.M. Burgess D.L. Sprunger L.K. Kohrman D.C. Meisler M.H. Genomics. 1998; 54: 287-296Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). The 92 nucleotide (nt) alternative exons, which are found in human, mouse, and rat genomic sequence and known to be used in other sodium channel family members, code for nearly identical amino acid sequences that differ at only two positions. The second, described in mouse and rat, involves the use of alternative 5′-splice donor sites in exon 12 (coding exon 11), which encodes a portion of the cytoplasmic loop between domains I and II (Fig. 2 and Ref. 12Dietrich P.S. McGivern J.G. Delgado S.G. Koch B.D. Eglen R.M. Hunter J.C. Sangameswaran L. J. Neurochem. 1998; 70: 2262-2272Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar). The resulting channels differ by 11 amino acid residues, and these isoforms exhibit distinct electrophysiological properties (Table I and Ref. 12Dietrich P.S. McGivern J.G. Delgado S.G. Koch B.D. Eglen R.M. Hunter J.C. Sangameswaran L. J. Neurochem. 1998; 70: 2262-2272Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar). Given conservation of the respective genomic sequences, we hypothesized that these alternative splice events might be expressed in human tissues. Gene-specific amplification primers for SCN8A were used to generate RT-PCR products from human DRG, and sequencing confirmed usage of both mutually exclusive exon 6 cassettes and alternative splice donor sites in exon 12 (Fig. 2). Inspection of genomic sequence of human, mouse and rat SCN9A suggested it has a gene structure similar to SCN8A. Specifically, the genome sequences from all three species encode potentially mutually exclusive exon 5 sequences, and evidence for alternative splicing of the rabbit paralog was deduced from cDNA sequences (24Belcher S.M. Zerillo C.A. Levenson R. Ritchie J.M. Howe J.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 11034-11038Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). Similarly, conservation of exon 11 alternative splice donor sites was found in human, mouse and rat genomic sequences, and evidence for alternative splicing was suggested by comparison of human, rat, and rabbit cDNA sequences (12Dietrich P.S. McGivern J.G. Delgado S.G. Koch B.D. Eglen R.M. Hunter J.C. Sangameswaran L. J. Neurochem. 1998; 70: 2262-2272Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar). Confirmation that both of alternative splice events occur in human SCN9A was obtained by sequencing of RT-PCR products amplified from human DRG (Fig. 2).Fig. 2Alternative splicing of SCN8A, SCN9A, and SCN11A transcripts.A, neonatal (N) and adult (A) alternative splices involve the use of mutually exclusive alternative exons. The RefSeq (RS; human SCN8A [NM_014191.1], human SCN9A [NM_002977.1]), and extended (EXT) coding exon 11 sequences are generated by the use of alternative splice donor sites. The SCN11A variant was generated by exon skipping (3Kan Z. Castle J. Johnson J.M. Tsinoremas N.F. Pac. Symp. Biocomput. 2004; : 42-53PubMed Google Scholar).

In animal models, caloric restriction (CR) suppresses these diseases as well as chemical-induced tissue damage. These beneficial effects of CR overlap with those altered by agonists of nuclear receptors (NR) under control of the fasting-responsive transcriptional co-activator, peroxisome proliferator-activated co-activator 1α (PGC-1α). In a screen for compounds that mimic CR effects in the liver, we found statistically significant overlaps between the CR transcript profile in wild-type mice and the profiles altered by agonists of lipid-activated NR, including peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor α (PPARα), liver X receptor, and their obligate heterodimer partner, retinoid X receptor. The overlapping genes included those involved in CVD (lipid metabolism and inflammation) and cancer (cell fate). Based on this overlap, we hypothesized that some effects of CR are mediated by PPARα. As determined by transcript profiling, 19% of all gene expression changes in wild-type mice were dependent on PPARα, including Cyp4a10 and Cyp4a14, involved in fatty acid ω-oxidation, acute phase response genes, and epidermal growth factor receptor but not increases in PGC-1α. CR protected the livers of wild-type mice from damage induced by thioacetamide, a liver toxicant and hepatocarcinogen. CR protection was lost in PPARα-null mice due to inadequate tissue repair. These results demonstrate that PPARα mediates some of the effects of CR and indicate that a pharmacological approach to mimicking many of the beneficial effects of CR may be possible.

A strategy for identifying drugs that mimic the beneficial effects of CR includes those that optimize glucose and lipid homeostasis and suppress inflammation (6Weindruch R. Keenan K.P. Carney J.M. Fernandes G. Feuers R.J. Floyd R.A. Halter J.B. Ramsey J.J. Richardson A. Roth G.S. Spindler S.R. J. Gerontol. A. Biol. Sci. Med. Sci. 2001; 1: 20-33Crossref Scopus (119) Google Scholar). These responses are partly under control of the nuclear receptors PPARα, LXRα/LXRβ, and RXR. PPARα is activated by endogenous fatty acids (7Gottlicher M. Widmark E. Li Q. Gustafsson J.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 4653-4657Crossref PubMed Scopus (795) Google Scholar), environmental chemicals, and clinically relevant hypolipidemic agents (8Corton J.C. Anderson S.P. Stauber A. Annu. Rev. Pharmacol. Toxicol. 2000; 40: 491-518Crossref PubMed Scopus (285) Google Scholar). PPARα regulates genes involved in gluconeogenesis as well as fatty acid transport and β-oxidation (8Corton J.C. Anderson S.P. Stauber A. Annu. Rev. Pharmacol. Toxicol. 2000; 40: 491-518Crossref PubMed Scopus (285) Google Scholar). LXRα and LXRβ are activated by naturally occurring oxysterols and regulate genes involved in reversed cholesterol transport, bile acid and triglyceride synthesis, glucose homeostasis, and inflammation (9Edwards P.A. Kennedy M.A. Mak P.A. Vascul. Pharmacol. 2002; 38: 249-256Crossref PubMed Scopus (180) Google Scholar, 10Tontonoz P. Mangelsdorf D.J. Mol. Endocrinol. 2003; 17: 985-993Crossref PubMed Scopus (519) Google Scholar). PPARα and LXR heterodimerize with RXR family members, which themselves can be activated by natural and synthetic retinoid compounds. Activation of one or more of these receptors in mice and rats leads to responses that overlap with those of CR, including decreases in serum cholesterol and triglyceride levels, decreased incidence of atherosclerosis in models of heart disease, increased insulin sensitivity in diabetes models, and inhibition of cancer incidence (8Corton J.C. Anderson S.P. Stauber A. Annu. Rev. Pharmacol. Toxicol. 2000; 40: 491-518Crossref PubMed Scopus (285) Google Scholar, 10Tontonoz P. Mangelsdorf D.J. Mol.

Lipidol. 2001; 12: 245-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (179) Google Scholar). Given these phenotypic overlaps, beneficial effects of CR might be mediated in part by mechanisms that overlap with those regulated by these NRs. In addition to a role in lipid metabolism, PPARα also determines responses to diverse forms of physical- and chemical-induced stress. When compared with PPARα-null mice, wild-type mice pre-exposed to PPARα agonists exhibit decreased mortality, decreased cellular damage, and increased tissue repair after exposure to physical and chemical stressors in the liver (12Anderson S.P. Yoon L. Richard E.B. Dunn C.S. Cattley R.C. Corton J.C. Hepatology. 2002; 36: 544-554Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar, 13Chen C. Hennig G.E. Whiteley H.E. Corton J.C. Manautou J.E.

Manautou J.E. Ronis M.J. Bucci T.J. Mehendale H.M. Toxicol. Sci. 2003; 73: 220-234Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). The ability of PPARα to regulate tissue repair genes may contribute to protection in the liver (12Anderson S.P. Yoon L. Richard E.B. Dunn C.S. Cattley R.C. Corton J.C. Hepatology. 2002; 36: 544-554Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar, 16Shankar K. Vaidya V.S. Wang T. Bucci T.J. Mehendale H.M. Toxicol. Appl. Pharmacol. 2003; 188: 122-134Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). Like activation of PPARα, CR protects tissues from chemical-induced toxicity (6Weindruch R. Keenan K.P. Carney J.M. Fernandes G. Feuers R.J. Floyd R.A. Halter J.B. Ramsey J.J. Richardson A. Roth G.S. Spindler S.R. J. Gerontol. A. Biol. Sci. Med. Sci. 2001; 1: 20-33Crossref Scopus (119) Google Scholar). Protection is thought to occur partly through elimination of damaged cells by apoptosis (17James S.J. Muskhelishvili L. Gaylor D.W. Turturro A. Hart R. Environ. Health Perspect. 1998; 106: 307-312Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar) or by modulation of genes involved in xenobiotic metabolism (18Keenan K.P. Laroque P. Dixit R.J. Toxicol. Environ. Health B. Crit. Rev. 1998; 1: 135-148Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). CR protected the livers of rats from permanent damage after exposure to the model hepatotoxicant thioacetamide through a timely and robust compensatory tissue repair response (19Apte U.M. Limaye P.B. Desaiah D. Bucci T.J. Warbritton A. Mehendale H.M. Toxicol. Sci. 2003; 72: 272-282Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). The mechanism by which CR protects the liver from damage is not known. Mammals have evolved highly regulated systems to maintain blood glucose levels within tight limits, even during times of food deprivation. Blood glucose levels are controlled by peripheral glucose uptake as well as the hormonal modulation of glucose production. Gluconeogenesis occurs during fasting in which insulin levels are low and in diabetic states in which the liver is insulin-resistant. PGC-1α, a transcriptional co-activator is a central regulator of glucose levels and the response to fasting. PGC-1α coordinately regulates genes involved in gluconeogenesis and fatty acid β-oxidation in the heart and liver during fasting (20Puigserver P. Spiegelman B.M. Endocr. Rev. 2003; 24: 78-90Crossref PubMed Scopus (1581) Google Scholar). The PGC-1α gene is induced at the transcriptional level by the cAMP response element-binding protein, CREB, a transcription factor activated by glucagon and cAMP under conditions of low glucose. PGC-1α mediates effects on metabolic pathways through both ligand-dependent and -independent activation of NR expressed in the liver, including hepatocyte nuclear factor-4α, glucocorticoid receptor, and PPARα (20Puigserver P. Spiegelman B.M. Endocr. Rev. 2003; 24: 78-90Crossref PubMed Scopus (1581) Google Scholar). In the heart, PGC-1α and PPARα were identified as downstream effectors of p38 kinase-dependent stress-activated signaling, indicating a link between extracellular stressors and alterations in energy metabolic gene expression (21Barger P.M. Browning A.C. Garner A.N. Kelly D.P. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 44495-44501Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (223) Google Scholar). PGC-1α may also play a role in the regulation of other NRs, including LXR (22Oberkofler H. Schraml E. Krempler F. Patsch W. Biochem. J. 2003; 371: 89-96Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar), farnesoid X receptor (23Zhang L. Fogg D.K. Waisman D.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 2053-2062Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar), and constitutive androstane receptor (24Maglich J.M. Watson J. McMillen P.J. Goodwin B. Willson T.M. Moore J.T. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 19832-19838Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (190) Google Scholar), all of which exhibit increased expression and/or activity during fasting. In an effort to identify compounds that mimic the CR transcriptional response, we compared the CR transcript profiles with the transcript profiles altered by agonists of NR under control of PGC-1α. In addition, we posed the hypothesis that many of the beneficial effects of CR are mediated by the NR under control of fasting-induced PGC-1α. As a first step to test this hypothesis, we determined the role of PPARα in CR transcriptional responses as well as CR protection from chemical-induced damage in the liver. Animals—Wild-type and PPARα-null mice on a SV129 background were used in these studies. Control and treated mice were provided with NIH-07 rodent chow (Zeigler Brothers, Gardeners, PA) and deionized filtered water ad libitum. Lighting was on a 12-h light/dark cycle. Mice were fed 90% of calculated AL levels for 1 week followed by 65% of AL for 4 weeks as described previously (19Apte U.M. Limaye P.B. Desaiah D. Bucci T.J. Warbritton A. Mehendale H.M. Toxicol. Sci. 2003; 72: 272-282Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). Under these conditions, we see the typical effects of CR in wild-type mice, including decreases in mean body weights (wild-type AL, 32.3 ± 1.4 g; wild-type CR, 21.6 ± 1.9 g) and decreases in serum glucose and triglyceride levels. PPARα-null mice exhibited similar changes in body weight (PPARα-null AL, 31.1 ± 3 g; PPARα-null CR, 21.9 ± 1.2 g) and decreases in glucose compared with wild-type mice (see below). In addition, our CR protocol increased apoptosis and decreased proliferation of hepatocytes in WT mice (data not shown), as observed earlier (17James S.J. Muskhelishvili L. Gaylor D.W. Turturro A. Hart R. Environ. Health Perspect. 1998; 106: 307-312Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). In separate studies carried out at CIIT Centers for Health Research, mice were given by gavage each day for 3 days the RXR agonist AGN 194,204 (Allergan, Irvine, CA) at 3 mg/kg/day or the PPARα agonist WY-14,643 (ChemSyn Science, Lenexa, KS) at 50 mg/kg/day. Mice were also fed a control diet or a diet containing WY in the diet (0.05%) for 1 week followed by a 40-min heat stress at 42 °C or heat stress alone. Mice were sacrificed 4 h after the heat stress. Experiments with T0901317 (25Stulnig T.M. Steffensen K.R. Gao H. Reimers M. Dahlman-Wright K. Schuster G.U. Gustafsson J.A. Mol. Pharmacol. 2002; 62: 1299-1305Crossref PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar), D3T (26Kwak M.K. Wakabayashi N. Itoh K. Motohashi H. Yamamoto M. Kensler T.W. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 8135-8145Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (586) Google Scholar), and DEHP and CR (27Wong J.S. Gill S.S. Toxicol. Appl. Pharmacol. 2002; 185: 180-196Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar) have been described. In the thioacetamide studies, female mice were fed Harlen Teklad rat chow (No. 7029, Madison, WI) AL or 65% of AL for 21 days. On day 22, all four groups were treated with a lethal dose of TA (1000 mg/kg, intraperitoneally in saline) and observed for signs of toxicity and mortality twice a day for 14 days. For time-course experiments, separate groups of mice were treated with TA (1000 mg/kg, intraperitoneally) and killed at 0, 12, 24, 36, 48, and 72 h after TA administration. Animals were sacrificed under diethyl ether anesthesia. Blood was collected for analysis of plasma glucose and triglyceride levels. Portions of the livers were snap frozen in liquid nitrogen and stored at -70 °C until analysis. Slices of liver were fixed in 10% neutral buffered formalin for 48 h, transferred to 70% ethanol, and embedded in paraffin; 5-μm sections were cut and mounted on slides and stained with hematoxylin and eosin. Hematoxylin and eosin-stained liver sections were examined by light microscopy. All animal studies were conducted under the federal guidelines for the use and care of laboratory animals and were approved by Institutional Animal Care and Use Committees. RNA Isolation and Transcript Profiling—For the analysis of livers, three mice were analyzed from each treatment group. Liver RNA was isolated using a modified guanidium isothiocyanate method (TRIzol®, Invitrogen) and was further purified using silica membrane spin columns (RNeasy®, Qiagen, Valencia, CA). RNA integrity was assessed by ethidium bromide staining followed by resolution on denaturing agarose gels and also by the RNA 6000 LabChip® kit using a 2100 Bioanalyzer (Agilent Technologies, Palo Alto, CA). For each sample, 15 μg of biotin-labeled cRNA was generated from 10 μg of total RNA and hybridized to GeneChip® Test3 arrays (Affymetrix, Inc., Santa Clara, CA) to determine the quality of the RNA. Subsequently, the same samples were hybridized to Murine GeneChip® U74Av2 GeneChips (Affymetrix). All procedures were carried out according to the manufacturer's recommendations using the antibody amplification technique. Images were processed using the Microarray Suite 5.0 software (Affymetrix). Hybridization quality was assessed by visual inspection of the image and from a report generated by Microarray Suite 5.0. Criteria for an acceptable hybridization were the following: background < 100, noise (RawQ) < 5, 3′/5′ ratio for select housekeeping genes < 4. Hybridizations not meeting these criteria were repeated, beginning at the target preparation step. The data were analyzed and statistically filtered using Rosetta Resolver® version 3.0 software (Rosetta Inpharmatics, Kirkland, WA). The threshold for significance was set at p ≤ 0.001 and ≥1.5-fold or ≤1.5-fold, and the relative increase or decrease in mRNA abundance for each gene was reported as a -fold change relative to control. Genes altered by CR in wild-type mice were further filtered using a Bonferroni correction of the p value (28Miller R.A. Chang Y. Galecki A.T. Al-Regaiey K. Kopchick J.J. Bartke A. Mol. Endocrinol. 2002; 16: 2657-2666Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar). Because CR responses are dependent on the genetic background of the mouse strain (29Forster M.J. Morris P. Sohal R.S. FASEB J. 2003; 17: 690-692Crossref PubMed Scopus (177) Google Scholar), the significant genes were compared with those genes altered by CR in an independent study in C57Bl/6 mice (27Wong J.S. Gill S.S. Toxicol. Appl. Pharmacol. 2002; 185: 180-196Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar) to identify common transcriptional targets of CR. Only those genes that were altered by CR in an identical direction in both studies were examined further. Genes were grouped into functional classes using KEGG (www.kegg.org) and Gene Ontology (www.geneontology.org). Identification of expressed sequence tags was facilitated by euGenes (iubio.bio.indiana.edu:89/mouse/). The CR, heat stress, WY, and AGN profiles were compared with those genes reported as statistically changed (≥1.5-fold or ≤1.5-fold) from the studies of Stulnig et al. (25Stulnig T.M. Steffensen K.R. Gao H. Reimers M. Dahlman-Wright K. Schuster G.U. Gustafsson J.A. Mol. Pharmacol. 2002; 62: 1299-1305Crossref PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar), Kwak et al. (26Kwak M.K. Wakabayashi N. Itoh K. Motohashi H. Yamamoto M. Kensler T.W. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 8135-8145Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (586) Google Scholar), and Wong and Gill (27Wong J.S. Gill S.S. Toxicol. Appl. Pharmacol. 2002; 185: 180-196Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar) for T1317, D3T, and DEHP, respectively. The Spearman rank correlation test was performed using SAS, version 6.12 (SAS Institute, Research Triangle Park, NC). A complete list of the 87 genes altered by CR, WY, T1317, AGN, and D3T in wild-type and nullizygous mice, including unique identifiers, is provided in the Supplementary Materials as Table S1. Reverse Transcriptase-PCR Analysis of Gene Expression—Real-time reverse transcriptase-PCR was performed as follows. After DNase treatment, total RNA was quantified (Ribogreen®, Molecular Probes, Inc., Eugene, OR) and diluted with water. 50 ng of RNA and PCR reagents was aliquoted into 96-well plates using an ABI Prism™ 6700 Automated Nucleic Acid Workstation (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA) and subjected to real-time quantitative PCR (TaqMan®, Applied Biosystems) using gene-specific primers (Table S2) and fluorescently labeled probes (Molecular Probes) designed by the Primer Express® software (Applied Biosystems). Amplification curves were generated using the ABI Prism™ 7900HT Sequence Detection System (Applied Biosystems). Expression relative to vehicle control animals was determined after normalizing to the ribosomal 18S gene. There were three animals per treatment group, and each sample was analyzed in duplicate. Variability is expressed as standard error of the mean. Western Blot—Procedures for preparation of liver lysates, Western blotting, and description of antibodies used have been described before (30Fan L.Q. Coley J. Miller R.T. Cattley R.C. Corton J.C. Biochem. Pharmacol. 2003; 65: 949-959Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). Estimation of Liver Injury—Plasma was separated by centrifugation and estimated for alanine aminotransferase activity (EC 2.6.1.2.), a marker of liver injury, by using Sigma kit 59UV (ALT) (Sigma). Liver injury assessed by ALT was corroborated by histopathology using liver sections stained with hematoxylin and eosin. Estimation of Tissue Repair—Liver cell division was determined by proliferating cell nuclear antigen (PCNA) staining on paraffin-embedded, 5-μm-thick liver sections as previously described (31Greenwell A. Foley J.F. Maronpot R.R. Cancer Lett. 1991; 59: 251-256Crossref PubMed Scopus (172) Google Scholar). Cells in various phases of the cell cycle were identified as follows: Go, cells with no staining; G1, cells with light brown nuclear staining; S, cells with deep brown nuclear staining; G2, cells with diffuse speckled nuclear staining and brown cytoplasmic staining; and M, cells with diffuse cytoplasmic staining with deep blue chromosomal staining (32Ramaiah S.K. Bucci T.J. Warbritton A. Soni M.G. Mehendale H.M. Toxicol. Sci. 1998; 45: 233-241Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Three slides per time point per group were observed under light microscopy. In all, 1000 cells were counted per animal per time point, and cells in S-phase of cell division were recorded. The percentage of cells in S-phase at each time point was calculated and used as an index of cell division. Statistical Analysis of Data—Overall statistical significance of gene expression by TaqMan was determined by two-way analysis of covariance using Proc.MIXED with α = 0.05 (SAS Institute, Research Triangle Park, NC). Student's t test was used to determine if statistically significant differences existed between individual groups. The t-tests for the four individual comparisons per gene were not adjusted for multiplicity. Other statistical tests of significance were done by analysis of variance post-hoc testing performed using the Tukey-Kramer test with a p value of <0.05 (JMP™, SAS Institute). The survival data was analyzed using the Kaplan-Meier test for significance. Identification of PPARα-dependent Genes Regulated by CR in Mouse Liver—To identify genes regulated by CR in wild-type mice and determine the role of PPARα in their regulation, transcript profiles were generated in the livers of AL and CR wild-type and PPARα-null mice using Affymetrix mouse U74Av2 GeneChips® containing ∼12,500 genes. We identified 87 genes altered by CR in wild-type mice (≥1.5-fold or ≤-1.5-fold) as described under “Experimental Procedures.” This number decreased to 78 as 9 of the genes were represented twice. In all cases, the expression behavior of the two expressed sequence tags was very similar (see below). The CR transcript profile from WT mice was dominated by down-regulated genes (85%). Fifteen of the 78 CR genes (19%) were dependent on PPARα for CR-mediated alteration, because the changes occurred only in wild-type mice (Fig. 1). To ensure the analysis resulted in a low false discovery rate, the expression of a number of genes was analyzed using TaqMan (Table I). We initially examined the expression of five genes that were altered in the transcript profiles in the same direction in the SV129 and C57Bl/6 strains. Changes in the expression of all of these genes were verified as to direction and magnitude in both the wild-type and PPARα-null mice indicating our methods of analysis were reliable. We next examined the expression of additional genes that fell into a number of functional categories of interest (described below). These genes were identified as altered in the wild-type SV129 mice by CR (p ≤ 0.001), but they either did not pass the fairly strict statistical criterion determined by a p ≤ 0.001 with a Bonferroni adjustment or they were not coordinately regulated in the two strains. Out of 22 comparisons (11 genes in wild-type and PPARα-null mice), 17 were confirmed by TaqMan (Table I). These results indicate that 1) our criteria for selection of the 78 CR-regulated genes is stringent with a low false discovery rate (<0.08), and 2) the less stringent methods for gene selection that we used in our initial analysis and that are more commonly used in the field (i.e. p ≤ 0.001) led to a higher false discovery rate indicating a greater need for confirmation of altered expression using other techniques.Table IExpression of CR-responsive genes in wild-type and PPARα-null mice determined by TaqManFunctional categoryGeneaGenes in bold are those identified using the more stringent criteria described under “Experimental Procedures.” Other genes were identified as altered by CR in wild-type SV129 mice (p ≤ 0.001)WT-ALWT-CRbNumbers are expressed as ratios of changes in CR versus ad libitum (AL) fed in the same strain as determined by TaqMan.

We compared the genes regulated in our studies with those recently identified as CR-responsive by Dhahbi et al. (33Dhahbi J.M. Kim H.J. Mote P.L. Beaver R.J. Spindler S.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2004; 101: 5524-5529Crossref PubMed Scopus (210) Google Scholar). Comparison was facilitated by the fact that identical DNA chips were used in the analyses. Out of the 18 overlapping genes that were CR-responsive in the two studies, 17 genes were regulated in an identical manner, despite the fact that there were differences in study design, including sex, genotype, and length of CR (male, SV129, and 5 weeks CR (our study) versus female, B6C3F1, and 2–8 weeks CR (33Dhahbi J.M.

Only one gene was regulated in an opposite manner in the two studies (Orm1). Most of the common genes were changed early after the initiation of CR (within 4 weeks), although 7 of the genes were classified as “late genes” and altered only after 8 weeks of CR. Bauer et al.

Recent studies with PARP-1 null mice and PARP-1 inhibitors have also demonstrated that PARP-1 has an essential role in nuclear factor-κB (NF-κB)-dependent gene expression induced by various inflammatory stimuli. In this study, we used primary cultured mouse glial cells to investigate the role of poly(ADP-ribosyl)ation by PARP-1 in NF-κB-dependent gene expression. PARP-1 inhibitors and the antisense RNA for PARP-1 mRNA suppressed lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced expression of tumor necrosis factor-α and inducible nitric-oxide synthase, suggesting that PARP-1 activity has a critical role in synthesis. Western blotting with anti-poly(ADP-ribose) antibody revealed that PARP-1 itself was mainly poly(ADP-ribosyl)ated in glial cells, i.e. automodified PARP-1 (AM-PARP). The amounts of AM-PARP were not affected by LPS treatment, but were decreased by PARP-1 inhibitors. Electrophoretic mobility shift assay revealed that PARP-1 inhibitors and the antisense RNA for PARP-1 mRNA reduced the LPS-induced DNA binding of NF-κB. Non-modified PARP-1 also reduced the DNA binding of NF-κB via its physical association with NF-κB, whereas AM-PARP had no effect. On the other hand, enhancement of the automodification of PARP-1 by the addition of NAD+, its substrate, promoted the DNA binding of NF-κB. Furthermore, in in vitro transcription assay, the addition of AM-PARP or NAD+ to nuclear extracts promoted NF-κB p50-dependent transcription. These results indicate that automodification of PARP-1 positively up-regulates formation of the NF-κB·DNA complex and enhances transcriptional activation. Therefore, AM-PARP may be critical for the NF-κB-dependent gene expression of some inflammatory mediators in glial cells.

Therefore, AM-PARP may be critical for the NF-κB-dependent gene expression of some inflammatory mediators in glial cells. Poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase-1 (PARP-1 1The abbreviations used are: PARP-1, poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase-1; PAR, poly(ADP-ribose); NF-κB, nuclear factor-κB; TNF-α, tumor necrosis factor-α; IL, interleukin; LPS, lipopolysaccharide; GAPDH, glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase; mAb, monoclonal antibody; pAb, polyclonal antibody; iNOS, inducible nitric-oxide synthase; AM-PARP, automodified PARP-1; NM-PARP, non-modified PARP-1; EMSA, electrophoretic mobility shift assay. 1The abbreviations used are: PARP-1, poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase-1; PAR, poly(ADP-ribose); NF-κB, nuclear factor-κB; TNF-α, tumor necrosis factor-α; IL, interleukin; LPS, lipopolysaccharide; GAPDH, glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase; mAb, monoclonal antibody; pAb, polyclonal antibody; iNOS, inducible nitric-oxide synthase; AM-PARP, automodified PARP-1; NM-PARP, non-modified PARP-1; EMSA, electrophoretic mobility shift assay.; EC 2.4.2.30) is an abundant nuclear protein that is activated by DNA strand breakage and that catalyzes the covalent attachment of poly-(ADP-ribose) (PAR) from NAD+ to numerous nuclear proteins and transcription factors, including histones; DNA polymerase α and β; p53; and PARP-1, itself being the major target, via its automodification domain (1de Murcia G. de Murcia J.M.

J. 1999; 342: 249-268Crossref PubMed Scopus (0) Google Scholar). Besides PARP-1, another six PARPs have been identified: short PARP, PARP-2, PARP-3, tankylase-1/2, and vault PARP (2D'Amours D. Desnoyers S. D'Silva I. Poirier G.G. Biochem. J. 1999; 342: 249-268Crossref PubMed Scopus (0) Google Scholar, 3Chiarugi A. Trends Pharmacol. Sci. 2002; 23: 122-129Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (267) Google Scholar). However, the physiological roles of poly(ADP-ribosyl)ation of nuclear proteins and transcription factors induced by PARPs are not completely understood. The initially identified subtype of the enzyme, PARP-1, has been thought to play a central role in the process of poly(ADP-ribosyl)ation because poly(ADP-ribosyl)ation is markedly reduced in most tissues of PARP-1 null mice (4Shieh W.M. Ame J.C. Wilson M.V. Wang Z.-Q. Koh D.W. Jacobson M.K. Jacobson E.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 30069-30072Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (261) Google Scholar). Transient poly(ADP-ribosyl)ation by PARP-1 can be induced by a wide variety of environmental stimuli, including reactive oxygen, ionizing radiation, and genotoxic stress (1de Murcia G. de Murcia J.M. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1994; 19: 172-176Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (761) Google Scholar, 2D'Amours D. Desnoyers S. D'Silva I. Poirier G.G. Biochem. J. 1999; 342: 249-268Crossref PubMed Scopus (0) Google Scholar). Thus, PARP-1 has been suggested to regulate DNA repair (5Dantzer F. Schreiber V. Niedergang C. Trucco C. Flatter E. de la Rubia G. Oliver J. Rolli V. de Murcia J.M. de Murcia G. Biochimie (Paris). 1999; 81: 69-75Crossref PubMed Scopus (304) Google Scholar). On the other hand, overactivation of PARP-1 by massively damaged DNA consumes NAD+ and consequently ATP, resulting in necrotic cell death by energy failure (3Chiarugi A. Trends Pharmacol. Sci. 2002; 23: 122-129Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (267) Google Scholar, 6Pieper A.A. Verma A. Zhang J. Snyder S.H. Trends Pharmacol. Sci. 1999; 20: 171-181Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (467) Google Scholar). There are many reports suggesting that PARP-1 is also involved in regulation of gene expression at the transcriptional step (2D'Amours D. Desnoyers S. D'Silva I. Poirier G.G. Biochem. J. 1999; 342: 249-268Crossref PubMed Scopus (0) Google Scholar, 3Chiarugi A. Trends Pharmacol. Sci. 2002; 23: 122-129Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (267) Google Scholar). PARP-1 seems to play dual roles in transcription. Poly(ADP-ribosyl)ation of transcription factors such as Yin-Yang 1 (7Oei S.L. Shi Y. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2001; 285: 27-31Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar), RNA polymerase II-associated factors (8Oei S.L. Griesenbeck J. Ziegler M. Schweiger M. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 1465-1469Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar), and p53 (9Mendoza-Alvarez H. Alvarez-Gonzalez R. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 36425-36430Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar) results in reversible silencing of transcription by impairing the DNA binding of these proteins. In other instances, PARP-1 was found to have only one function, stimulating the DNA binding activity of transcription factors such as Oct-1 (10Nie J. Sakamoto S. Song D. Qu Z. Ota K. Taniguchi T. FEBS Lett. 1998; 424: 27-32Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar) and B-Myb (11Cervellera M.N. Sala A. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 10692-10696Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar). Recent reports have also shown that PARP-1 is required for specific nuclear factor-κB (NF-κB)-dependent gene expression and acts as a coactivator for NF-κB in vitro (13Oliver F.J. de Murcia J.M. Nacci C. Decker P. Andriantsitohaina R. Muller S. de la Rubia G. Stoclet J.C. de Murcia G. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 4446-4454Crossref PubMed Scopus (535) Google Scholar, 14Hassa P.O. Covic M. Hasan S. Imhof R. Hottiger M.O. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 45588-45597Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (264) Google Scholar). Indeed, the NF-κB-dependent transcription of some inflammatory mediators in response to endotoxin (13Oliver F.J. de Murcia J.M. Nacci C. Decker P. Andriantsitohaina R. Muller S. de la Rubia G. Stoclet J.C. de Murcia G. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 4446-4454Crossref PubMed Scopus (535) Google Scholar) or pro-inflammatory cytokines such as tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α) and interleukin-1β (IL-1β) (12Hassa P.O. Hottiger M.O. Biol. Chem. 1999; 380: 953-959Crossref PubMed Scopus (263) Google Scholar, 13Oliver F.J. de Murcia J.M. Nacci C. Decker P. Andriantsitohaina R. Muller S. de la Rubia G. Stoclet J.C. de Murcia G.

Chem. 2001; 276: 45588-45597Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (264) Google Scholar) is almost completely abrogated in PARP-1 null mice. Thus, anti-inflammatory effects of PARP-1 inhibitors have been extensively discussed in relation to various inflammation-related diseases (15Hassa P.O. Hottiger M.O. CMLS Cell. Mol. Life Sci. 2002; 59: 1534-1553Crossref PubMed Scopus (345) Google Scholar, 16Hasko G. Mabley J.G. Nemeth Z.H. Pacher P. Deitch E.A. Szabo C. Mol. Med. (N. Y.). 2002; 8: 283-289Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). However, the exact biochemical mechanism by which PARP-1 regulates NF-κB-dependent transcription is obscure. To date, some groups have reported that the enzyme activity of PARP-1 might directly influence NF-κB-dependent transcription. Kameoka et al. (17Kameoka M. Ota K. Tetsuka T. Tanaka Y. Itaya A. Okamoto T. Yoshihara K. Biochem. J. 2000; 346: 641-649Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar) showed that poly(ADP-ribosyl)ation markedly suppresses the DNA binding activity of NF-κB via direct modification in vitro. Chang and Alvarez-Gonzalez (18Chang W.J. Alvarez-Gonzalez R. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 47664-47670Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar) demonstrated that the DNA binding activity of NF-κB p50 is NAD+-dependent and reversibly regulated by the automodification of PARP-1 under cell-free conditions. In contrast, Hassa et al. (14Hassa P.O. Covic M. Hasan S. Imhof R. Hottiger M.O. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 45588-45597Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (264) Google Scholar) concluded that neither the enzyme activity nor the DNA binding activity of PARP-1 is required for NF-κB-dependent transcription. Thus, there are contradictory results (15Hassa P.O. Hottiger M.O. CMLS Cell. Mol. Life Sci. 2002; 59: 1534-1553Crossref PubMed Scopus (345) Google Scholar). To further investigate the role of poly(ADP-ribosyl)ation by PARP-1 in NF-κB-dependent transcription in inflammation, we examined the effects of several PARP-1 inhibitors and the antisense RNA for PARP-1 mRNA on lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced expression of some inflammatory mediators in primary cultured mouse glial cells. Cultured glial cells, composed of macroglia (astrocytes and oligodendrocytes) and microglia, were found to be a good in vitro model for neuro-inflammatory diseases such as stroke (19Eliasson M.J. Sampei K. Mandir A.S. Hurn P.D. Traystman R.J. Bao J. Pieper A. Wang Z.-Q. Dawson T.M. Snyder S.H. Dawson V.L. Nat. Med. 1997; 3: 1089-1095Crossref PubMed Scopus (943) Google Scholar) and Parkinson's disease (20Mandir A.S. Przedborski S. Jackson-Lewis V. Wang Z.-Q. Simbulan-Rosenthal C.M. Smulson M.E. Hoffman B.E. Guastella D.B. Dawson V.L. Dawson T.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 5774-5779Crossref PubMed Scopus (347) Google Scholar), which are implicated in the activation of PARP-1. Although these previous reports have focused on the activation of neuronal PARP-1, the pathophysiological significance of poly(ADP-ribosyl)ation catalyzed by PARP-1 in glial cells remains unclear. Here, we report that poly(ADP-ribosyl)ated PARP-1 itself, i.e. automodified PARP-1, has a critical role in NF-κB-dependent transcription and gene expression in glial cells. Isotopes—[adenine-2,8-3H]NAD+, [adenylate-32P]NAD+, [α-32P]GTP, and [γ-32P]ATP were purchased from PerkinElmer Life Sciences. Antibodies—The following antibodies were obtained from the indicated commercial sources: mouse anti-GAPDH monoclonal antibody (mAb) (MAB374, Chemicon International, Inc., Temecula, CA); mouse anti-PARP-1 mAb (SA-250) and rabbit anti-PAR polyclonal antibody (pAb) (SA-276) (BIOMOL Research Labs Inc., Plymouth Meeting, PA); rabbit anti-PARP-1 pAb (Roche Applied Science, Mannheim, Germany); mouse anti-PAR mAb (4335-MC) and guinea pig anti-PAR pAb (4336-PC) (Trevigen, Gaithersburg, MD); mouse anti-PAR mAb (10H, Alexis Biochemicals, Lausen, Switzerland); mouse anti-NF-κB p50 mAb (sc-8414), rabbit anti-p50 pAb (sc-7178), and rabbit anti-NF-κB p65 pAb (sc-109) (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Santa Cruz, CA); and mouse anti-inducible nitric-oxide synthetase (iNOS) mAb (Transduction Laboratories, Lexington, KY). Other Materials—The following reagents were obtained from the indicated commercial sources: benzamide and nicotinamide (Nacalai Tesque, Kyoto, Japan); 3-aminobenzamide (Sigma); 1,5-dihydroxyisoquinoline (RBI, Natick, MA); pcDNA3, Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium, and SuperScript II RNase H– reverse transcriptase (Invitrogen); cytokine enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay kits, protein A and G-Sepharose, and the enhanced chemiluminescence ECL detection system (Amersham Biosciences); the gel shift assay kit, the HeLaScribe® nuclear extract in vitro transcription system, the ϕX174 DNA/HinfI dephosphorylation marker, and the human recombinant p50 subunit of NF-κB (Promega, Madison, WI); LPS (Escherichia coli 0111:B4) (Difco); and Effectene transfection reagent and the RNeasy mini-kit (QIAGEN Japan, Tokyo, Japan). All other materials we used were of analytical grade. Cell Culture and Transfection—Primary mixed glial cultures were prepared from neonatal BALB/c mice (1–2 days old) as described previously (21Kong L.-Y. Lai C. Wilson B.C. Simpson J.N. Hong J.-S. Neurochem. Int. 1997; 30: 491-497Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar) with some modifications. Cells harvested by centrifugation at 800 × g for 5 min were resuspended; grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum (JRH Biosciences, Lenexa, KS), 100 units/ml penicillin, and 100 μg/ml streptomycin; and seeded in 6- or 24-well culture plates. The cells were incubated at 37 °C in a humidified atmosphere of 5% CO2. The medium was changed twice each week. The cultures were used at 14–18 days after plating. Immunohistochemical analysis indicated that the cultures consisted of 72% astrocytes and 22% microglia (data not shown). For transfection of the antisense RNA expression vector for PARP-1 mRNA, microglial cells were mechanically isolated from the primary mixed glial culture as described previously (22Nakajima K. Hamanoue M. Shimojo M. Takei N. Kohsaka S. Biomed. Res. 1989; 10: 411-423Crossref Scopus (0) Google Scholar) and then seeded in a 24-well plate at 1–2 × 105 cells/well. The purity of the cultures was >95% as estimated by morphological criteria and by their reactivity toward MRC-OX42 (CD11b, a maker of microglia). A 3.0-kb full-length mouse PARP-1 cDNA was cloned in an antisense orientation in the expression vector pcDNA3 as described previously (23Simbulan-Rosenthal C.M. Rosenthal D.S. Iyer S. Boulares A.H. Smulson M.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 13703-13712Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (255) Google Scholar). The resulting antisense or mock vector (pcDNA3) was transfected into microglia (1 h after plating) using the Effectene transfection reagent for 24 h according to the manufacturer's protocol. The efficacy of transfection was assessed by PARP catalytic activity (24Tanuma S. Kanai Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1982; 257: 6565-6570Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Treatment of the cells with the antisense vector down-regulated the resulting PARP activity to 62% versus the control; efficacy was calculated as 38% of the total cells (n = 4) (data not shown). Assessment of Cell Viability—The viability of glial cells was assessed by Alamar Blue™ (BIOSOURCE) according to the manufacturer's protocol. Measurement of Cytokines and Nitrite—The culture supernatants were collected at the indicated times, and the levels of TNF-α, IL-1β, and IL-6 were measured using the respective mouse enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay kits according to the manufacturer's protocol. The detection limit for assays was 50 pg/ml. The nitrite concentration was measured with a standard Griess reaction adapted to microplates as described previously (25Kong L.-Y. McMillian M.K. Maronpot R. Hong J.-S. Brain Res. 1997; 729: 102-109Crossref Scopus (63) Google Scholar). The sensitivity of this assay was ∼0.5 μm. Western Blotting—For sample preparation, the attached cells were washed twice with ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline, solubilized in lysis buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.2, 1 mm EDTA, 150 mm NaCl, 0.1% SDS, 0.5% sodium deoxycholate, 1% Nonidet P-40, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 10 μg/ml aprotinin, and 10 μg/ml leupeptin), and sonicated on ice for 10 s. After centrifugation at 15,000 × g for 10 min at 4 °C, the cleared supernatants were obtained; an equal volume of SDS sample buffer (0.25 m Tris-HCl, pH 6.8, 2% SDS, 10% 2-mercaptoethanol, 30% glycerol, and 0.01% bromphenol blue) was added; and the sample was heated at 100 °C for 5 min. Protein concentrations of the samples were determined by the Bradford assay (Bio-Rad). Protein samples were separated by 5–20% SDS-PAGE (DRC, Tokyo) and transferred to Immobilon P membranes (Millipore, Tokyo). The membranes were incubated for 1 h with 5% bovine serum albumin in phosphate-buffered saline containing 0.05% Tween 20 and 0.02% NaN3 to block nonspecific binding and then incubated overnight at 4 °C with anti-PAR pAb (1:500), anti-PAR mAb (1:1000), anti-PARP-1 mAb (1:5000), or anti-iNOS mAb (1:5000). Subsequently, the membranes were incubated with an affinity-purified peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibody (Zymed Laboratories Inc.). PAR-bound proteins, PARP-1, and iNOS were detected using the ECL detection system according to the manufacturer's protocol. The membranes were also reprobed with anti-GAPDH mAb (1:500). These band intensities were quantified with NIH Image Version 1.61. Measurement of Cellular PARP-1 Activity—Measurement of cellular PARP-1 activity was performed as described previously (26Szabo C. Cuzzocrea S. Zingarelli B. O'Connor M. Salzman A.L. J. Clin. Investig. 1997; 100: 723-735Crossref PubMed Scopus (353) Google Scholar). Briefly, cells were washed twice with ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline; resuspended in 0.5 ml of assay buffer containing 56 mm Hepes-KOH, pH 7.5, 28 mm KCl, 28 mm NaCl, 2 mm MgCl2, 30 μm digitonin, 125 μm NAD+, and 18 kBq/ml [adenine-2,8-3H]; and incubated for 10 min at 37 °C. After incubation, ice-cold 20% trichloroacetic acid was added, and the samples were further incubated for 30 min at 4 °C. The samples were then washed twice with ice-cold 10% trichloroacetic acid and solubilized overnight in 2% SDS and 0.1 n NaOH at 37 °C. The radioactivity of each sample was measured in a liquid scintillation counter. Reverse Transcription-PCR—Total RNA from glial cells was prepared using RNeasy. cDNA was synthesized by SuperScript II RNase H– reverse transcriptase according to the manufacturer's protocol. The sequences of the oligonucleotide primers used as a control for RNA isolation and reverse-transcription were as follows: for mouse TNF-α (354 bp), 5′-TTCTGTCTACTGAACTTCGGGGTAATCGGTCC-3′ (upstream) and 5′-GTATGAGATAGCAAATCGGCTGACGGTGTGGG-3′ (downstream); and for mouse GAPDH (558 bp), 5′-TGCTGAGTATGTCGTGGAGTCT-3′ (upstream) and 5′-AATGGGAGTTGCTGTTGAAGTC-3′ (downstream). One PCR cycle was run under the following conditions: DNA denaturation at 94 °C for 30 s, primer annealing at 60 °C for 1 min, and DNA extension at 72 °C for 1 min (28 cycles for TNF-α and 22 cycles for GAPDH). Semiquantification of mRNA levels of TNF-α and 18 S ribosomal RNA (used as a control) was carried out using a TaqMan cytokine gene expression plate and ABI PRISM 7700 (PerkinElmer Life Sciences) according to the manufacturer's protocol. Preparation of Automodified PARP-1 (AM-PARP) and Non-modified PARP-1 (NM-PARP)—Construction of recombinant baculovirus containing cDNA of human His-tagged PARP-1, its expression in insect cells, and protein purification are described elsewhere (27Giner H. Simonin F. de Murcia G. de Murcia J.M. Gene (Amst.). 1992; 114: 279-283Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). AM-PARP was prepared by the following procedure. Purified His-PARP-1 was incubated in buffer containing 100 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 10 mm MgCl2, 1mm dithiothreitol, 1 μm NAD+, and 20 μg/ml synthetic octameric DNA (5′-GGAATTCC-3′) at 37 °C. After 5 min, the reactions were terminated by passing the mixture through a spin column (prepared with a 1-ml cylinder filled with Sephadex G-25 and equilibrated with 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.2, and 1 mm EDTA) by centrifugation at 800 × g for 3 min. The concentration of the resulting proteins was measured, and the proteins were stored at –30 °C until used. NM-PARP was obtained by the same protocol as used for AM-PARP, except for incubation with 1 μm NAD+. Preparation of Nuclear Extracts—Nuclear extracts from unstimulated or LPS-stimulated glial cells (1–5 × 105 cells) were prepared by the method of Lukasiuk et al. (28Lukasiuk K. Kaczmarek L. Condorelli D.F. Neurochem. Int. 1995; 26: 173-178Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar) with slight modifications. Cells were washed twice with ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline; lysed in 400 μlof buffer containing 10 mm Hepes-KOH, pH 7.8, 10 mm KCl, 0.1 mm EDTA, 0.1 mm EGTA, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 1 mm sodium vanadate, 0.5 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 2.5 μg/ml aprotinin, 1 μg/ml pepstatin A, and 0.5 μg/ml leupeptin containing 0.1% Nonidet P-40 for 10 min on ice; vortexed vigorously for 15 s; and centrifuged at 12,000 × g for 3 min. The pelleted nuclei were resuspended in 100 μl of buffer containing 20 mm Hepes-KOH, pH 7.8, 0.4 m KCl, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm EGTA, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 1 mm sodium vanadate, 0.5 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 2.5 μg/ml aprotinin, 1 μg/ml pepstatin A, and 0.5 μg/ml leupeptin; mixed vigorously for 15 min at 4 °C; and centrifuged at 15,000 × g for 30 min. Supernatants containing the nuclear proteins were stored at –80 °C. Electrophoretic Mobility Shift Assay (EMSA)—The nuclear extracts (10 μg) were preincubated in a total volume of 19 μl of gel shift binding buffer (10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 1 mm MgCl2, 0.5 mm dithiothreitol, 0.5 mm EDTA, 50 mm NaCl, 5% glycerol, and 0.05 mg/ml poly(dI-dC)) for 10 min on ice. The sample was mixed with 1 μlof 32P-labeled NF-κB probe (5′-AGTTGAGGGGACTTTCCCAGGC-3′), which was end-labeled with [γ-32P]ATP using T4 DNA polynucleotide kinase; and the mixtures were then further incubated for 20 min at room temperature. For EMSA with purified proteins, purified recombinant NF-κB p50 (350 ng) was preincubated with purified His-PARP-1 (20, 100, or 200 ng; non-modified or automodified) for 20 min at room temperature in buffer containing 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 60 mm KCl, 5 mm MgCl2, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 0.05% Nonidet P-40, 10% glycerol, and 50 μg/ml bovine serum albumin (18Chang W.J. Alvarez-Gonzalez R. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 47664-47670Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar) and mixed with the 32P-labeled probe, and the mixtures were further incubated for 30 min at room temperature. Additionally, LPS-stimulated nuclear extract (10 μg) and purified His-PARP-1 (200 ng; non-modified or automodified) were incubated for 20 min at room temperature in gel shift binding buffer and mixed with the 32P-labeled probe, and the mixtures were then further incubated for 20 min at room temperature. After the reactions, the protein·DNA complexes were separated on a 6% nondenaturing polyacrylamide gel (DRC) using the gel shift assay kit according to the manufacturer's protocol. In the supershift assay, 2 μg of anti-p65 pAb were added, and the samples were incubated for 30 min at 4 °C before the addition of 32P-labeled probes. The competition experiments were performed by adding a 100-fold molar excess of unlabeled probes with the 32P-labeled probes. Poly(ADP-ribosyl)ation in Nuclear Extracts—Assays were performed as described by Chang and Alvarez-Gonzalez (18Chang W.J. Alvarez-Gonzalez R. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 47664-47670Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar). Each 10-μg sample in assay buffer containing 100 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 20 mm MgCl2, and 1 mm dithiothreitol was preincubated with 10 mm 3-aminobenzamide for 5 min at 37 °C before the addition of 10 μm NAD+ to start a reaction. Control assays were performed in the same manner, except that no 3-aminobenzamide was added. After 10 min, an equal volume of 2× gel shift binding buffer was added to each mixture, which was then incubated for 20 min at room temperature before EMSA. Alternatively, the poly(ADP-ribosyl)ated proteins were resolved by Western blotting with rabbit anti-PAR pAb as described above. Co-immunoprecipitation Assay—In a cell-free system, the procedure reported previously (18Chang W.J. Alvarez-Gonzalez R. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 47664-47670Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar) was used. NM- or AM-PARP (200 ng) and the p50 subunit (350 ng) were preincubated for 30 min at 4 °C in buffer containing 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 150 mm NaCl, and 0.1% Nonidet P-40. Anti-p50 pAb (2 μg) was added, and the mixture was incubated for 60 min at 4 °C. Protein G-Sepharose beads (1:1 slurry) were added next, and the samples were further incubated for 60 min at 4 °C with rocking. After centrifugation at 5000 × g for 1 min, both the first supernatants and the pellet of beads were collected. The beads were further washed five times, and then the bead-bound proteins were eluted by adding SDS sample buffer and heating at 100 °C for 5 min. The eluted proteins and the supernatants were submitted to Western blotting with anti-p50 mAb, anti-PARP-1 mAb, or anti-PAR mAb (10H) as described above. To assess the association of PARP-1 with the p50 subunit in vivo, glial nuclear extracts (1 mg) prepared as described above were initially incubated with both rabbit control IgG (5 μg) and protein G-Sepharose beads for 30 min at 4 °C with rocking to block nonspecific binding. After centrifugation, the supernatants were obtained, and the following procedure, which was similar to the procedure used in the cell-free system, was performed. Immunodepletion Assay—To remove AM-PARP in glial cells by immunodepletion (29Akiyama T. Takasawa S. Nata K. Kobayashi S. Abe M. Shervani N.J. Ikeda T. Nakagawa K. Unno M. Matsuno S. Okamoto H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 48-53PubMed Google Scholar), total cell extracts (100 μg/50 μl) or LPS-treated nuclear extracts (50 μg/25 μl) were preincubated for 60 min at 4 °C with one of the following antibodies (2 μg/assay): rabbit control IgG, anti-PARP-1 pAb, or rabbit anti-PAR pAb. Subsequently, protein A-Sepharose beads (1:1 slurry) were added, and the samples were further incubated for 45 min at 4 °C with rocking. After centrifugation at 5000 × g for 1 min, the supernatants were obtained, and free proteins were submitted to Western blotting with anti-PARP-1 mAb or rabbit anti-PAR pAb as described above. In Vitro Transcription Assay (Runoff Assay)—In vitro transcription reactions were performed as described by Dignam et al. (30Dignam D.J. Lebovitz R.M. Roeder R.G. Nucleic Acids Res. 1983; 11: 1475-1489Crossref PubMed Scopus (9150) Google Scholar) following the HeLaScribe® nuclear extract in vitro transcription system protocol provided by the manufacturer. Briefly, 25-μl reaction mixtures were prepared by combining HeLa nuclear extract (8 units/reaction) with ATP, UTP, and CTP (0.4 mm each) and GTP (0.012 mm) in buffer containing 3 mm MgCl2. [α-32P]GTP (3000 Ci/mmol, 10 mCi/ml) was used to label runoff transcripts. The standard reactions were performed in the presence of 50 ng of human recombinant NF-κB p50 or bovine serum albumin, and 30 ng of linearized pNF-κB-Luc plasmid (Stratagene) digested with BsrGI were used as a template. The commercially available plasmid has five NF-κB-binding sites (TGGGGACTTTCCGC) in the promoter region and a unique restriction site by BsrGI in the open reading frame of the luciferase gene (see Fig. 9A). The reactions were started by the addition of HeLa nuclear extract and incubated at 30 °C for 45 min. The reactions were terminated by the addition of 175 μl of stop solution containing of 0.3 m Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 0.3 m sodium acetate, 0.5% SDS,"
https://openalex.org/W2039330045,"Dicer is a ribonuclease III-like enzyme playing a key role in the RNA silencing pathway. Genome sequencing projects have demonstrated that eukaryotic genomes vary in the numbers of Dicer-like (DCL) proteins from one (human) to four (Arabidopsis). Two DCL genes, MDL-1 and -2 (Magnaporthe Dicer-like-1 and -2) have been identified in the genome of the filamentous fungus Magnaporthe oryzae. Here we show that the knockout of MDL-2 drastically impaired gene silencing of enhanced green fluorescence protein by hairpin RNA and reduced related small interfering RNA (siRNA) accumulation to nondetectable levels. In contrast, mutating the other DCL, MDL-1, exhibited a gene silencing frequency similar to wild type and accumulated siRNA normally. The silencing-deficient phenotype and loss of siRNA accumulation in the mdl-2 mutant was restored by genetic complementation with the wild-type MDL-2 allele. These results indicate that only MDL-2 is responsible for siRNA production, and no functional redundancy exists between MDL-1 and MDL-2 in the RNA silencing pathway in M. oryzae. Our findings contrast with a recent report in the filamentous fungus Neurospora crassa, where two DCL proteins are redundantly involved in the RNA silencing pathway, but are similar to the results obtained in a more distantly related organism, Drosophila melanogaster, where an individual DCL protein has a distinct role in the siRNA/micro-RNA pathways.

The ribonuclease III (RNase III) 1The abbreviations used are: RNase III, ribonuclease III; dsRNA, double-stranded RNA; RISC, RNA-inducing silencing complex; siRNA, small interfering RNA; miRNA, micro-RNA; DCL, Dicer-like; HPH, hygromycin phosphotransferase; GFP, green fluorescent protein; EGFP, enhanced green fluorescent protein; nt, nucleotide(s); RT, reverse transcriptase. family, which specifically processes double-stranded RNA (dsRNA) precursors into mature RNAs, is one of the most interesting endonuclease families. RNase III enzymes of the Dicer class are large multidomain proteins and have been shown to play an important role in the post-transcriptional gene silencing pathway triggered by double-stranded RNA. Here, we call the silencing mechanisms collectively, RNA silencing, since this phenomenon has been termed “co-suppression or PTGS” (post-transcriptional gene silencing) in plants, “quelling” in the fungus Neurospora crassa, and “RNA interference” in animals (1Baulcombe D. Curr. Biol. 2002; 12: 82-84Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In the RNA silencing pathway, Dicer cleaves long dsRNA into short RNA duplexes of 21–25 nucleotides (small interfering RNAs (siRNAs)) (2Zamore P.D. Tuschl T. Sharp P.A. Bartel D.P. Cell. 2000; 101: 25-33Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 3Bernstein E.C.A. Hammond S.M. Hannon G.J.

Subsequently, these siRNAs are incorporated into the RNA-inducing silencing complex (RISC) to serve as sequence-specific guides for targeting cognate mRNA for destruction (5Hammond S.M. Bernstein E. Beach D. Hannon G.J. Nature. 2000; 404: 293-296Crossref PubMed Scopus (2405) Google Scholar). Recently, Dicer has been implicated in down-stream processes of siRNA production in the silencing pathway. Depletion of Dicer in mammalian cells resulted in a significant reduction in gene silencing efficiency induced by cognate siRNA treatment (6Doi N. Zenno S. Ueda R. Ohki-Hamazaki H. Ui-Tei K. Saigo K. Curr. Biol. 2003; 13: 41-46Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (186) Google Scholar). Supporting this, Dicer has been shown to physically interact with protein components of RISC and siRNAs (7Pham J.W. Pellino J.L. Lee Y.S. Carthew R.W. Sontheimer E.J. Cell. 2004; 117: 83-94Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (349) Google Scholar). In addition to the RNA silencing pathway, Dicer also plays an essential role in developmental pathways by generating regulatory 19–25-nucleotide small RNAs, termed micro-RNAs (miRNAs), from longer partially double-stranded RNA precursors (8Hutvagner G. McLachlan J. Pasquinelli A.E. Balint E. Tuschl T. Zamore P.D. Science. 2001; 293: 834-838Crossref PubMed Scopus (2184) Google Scholar, 9Ketting R.F. Fischer S.E. Bernstein E. Sijen T. Hannon G.J.

EMBO J. 2002; 21: 4663-4670Crossref PubMed Scopus (1712) Google Scholar). miRNAs negatively regulate gene expression by annealing to the 3′-untranslated region of target transcripts and directly interfere with translation (11Olsen P.H. Ambros V. Dev. Biol. 1999; 216: 671-680Crossref PubMed Scopus (951) Google Scholar, 12Lai E.C. Nat. Genet. 2002; 30: 363-364Crossref PubMed Scopus (1187) Google Scholar) or, in some cases, by inducing sequence-specific nucleolysis (13Llave C. Xie Z. Kasschau K.D. Carrington J.C. Science. 2002; 297: 2053-2056Crossref PubMed Scopus (1308) Google Scholar, 14Dunoyer P. Lecellier C.H. Parizotto E.A. Himber C. Voinnet O. Plant Cell. 2004; 16: 1235-1250Crossref PubMed Scopus (386) Google Scholar). Therefore, Dicer enzymes are key components in the small RNA-mediated gene regulation mechanisms. Genome-wide sequencing projects have revealed that Dicer-like (DCL) proteins are evolutionarily conserved in a wide range of eukaryotic genomes. Interestingly, the number of DCL proteins in the genome varies among distinct organisms (15Schauer S.E. Jacobsen S.E. Meinke D.W. Ray A. Trends Plant Sci. 2002; 7: 487-491Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (402) Google Scholar). For example, only one DCL protein has been identified in the genomes of human, mouse, nematode Caenorhabditis elegans, and fission yeast Schizosaccharomyces pombe, whereas multiple DCL proteins have been found in other organisms such as the fruit fly Drosophila melanogaster (two), plants Arabidopsis thaliana (four) and Oryza sativa (two), and filamentous fungi N. crassa (two) and Magnaporthe oryzae (two). It is not still clear how the multiple DCL proteins in the genome participate in the siRNA/miRNA silencing pathways. Catalanotto et al. (16Catalanotto C. Pallotta M. ReFalo P. Sachs M.S. Vayssie L. Macino G. Cogoni C. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2004; 24: 2536-2545Crossref PubMed Scopus (161) Google Scholar) recently showed that transgene-induced RNA silencing in N. crassa was not compromised in either of the single mutants of the two DCL proteins but was impaired in the double DCL mutant, thereby suggesting that both N. crassa DCL proteins were redundantly involved in the RNA silencing pathway. In contrast, Lee et al. (17Lee Y.S. Nakahara K. Pham J.W. Kim K. He Z. Sontheimer E.J. Carthew R.W. Cell. 2004; 117: 69-81Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1013) Google Scholar) demonstrated that both of the single Dicer mutants (dicer-1 and dicer-2) in Drosophila had some degree of deficiency in the silencing phenotype induced by hairpin-RNA and indicated that both Dicer-1 and Dicer-2 were involved in the RNA silencing pathway by playing different roles; Dicer-2 was responsible for siRNA production in the initiation step, and both Dicer-1 and Dicer-2 were involved in siRNA-dependent RISC formation in the effector step. In addition, they showed that Dicer-1 was solely responsible for the production of mature miRNA. Therefore, Dicer-1 and Dicer-2 appear to have distinct roles in the siRNA/miRNA silencing pathways with respect to the small RNA species they generate. Similar to Drosophila, DCL proteins in Arabidopsis also appear to function differently in the siRNA/miRNA silencing pathways (18Finnegan E.J. Margis R. Waterhouse P.M. Curr. Biol. 2003; 13: 236-240Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar, 19Xie Z. Johansen L.K. Gustafson A.M. Kasschau K.D. Lellis A.D. Zilberman D. Jacobsen S.E. Carrington J.C. PLoS Biol. 2004; 2: 642-652Crossref Scopus (1212) Google Scholar). Mutation of DCL1 (CAF), one of the four Arabidopsis DCL proteins, blocked miRNA production but not siRNA accumulation or hairpin RNA-induced silencing, whereas those of DCL2 and DCL3 resulted in a decrease in virus-derived and endogenous siRNA biogenesis, respectively (19Xie Z. Johansen L.K. Gustafson A.M. Kasschau K.D. Lellis A.D. Zilberman D. Jacobsen S.E. Carrington J.C. PLoS Biol. 2004; 2: 642-652Crossref Scopus (1212) Google Scholar). One possible explanation for the difference in redundancy of DCL proteins in the RNA silencing pathway among the organisms could be that functions of DCL proteins may be differentiated during evolutionary processes from lower eukaryotes such as fungi to higher eukaryotes such as plants and insects. Alternatively, it is possible that the degree of functional diversity of DCL proteins differs even in closely related organisms. The ascomycete fungus M. oryzae (formerly Magnaporthe grisea) (20Couch B.C. Kohn L.M. Mycologia. 2002; 94: 683-693Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) is the causal agent of blast disease on many gramineous plants and is taxonomically close to N. crassa. Due to its economic importance, the genome sequence of rice blast fungus was determined in 2002 (21Martin S.L. Blackmon B.P. Rajagopalan R. Houfek T.D. Sceeles R.G. Denn S.O. Mitchell T.K. Brown D.E. Wing R.A. Dean R.A. Nucleic Acids Res. 2002; 30: 121-124Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). Thus, M. oryzae offers a model system for elucidating fungal pathogen-plant interactions. We have demonstrated that RNA silencing occurred in the fungus with the molecular features consistent with this type of gene silencing (22Kadotani N. Nakayashiki H. Tosa Y. Mayama S. Mol. Plant Microbe Interact. 2003; 16: 769-776Crossref PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar). We identified two DCL-like genes, by data base comparison, in the genome of M. oryzae and tentatively named them MDL-1 and -2 (Magnaporthe Dicer-like-1 and -2). To gain insights into roles of MDL-1 and -2 in M. oryzae, we disrupted these genes by homologous recombination and examined the characteristics of the mutants in detail. Here we demonstrate that one of the two DCL proteins in M. oryzae is responsible for siRNA production in the RNA silencing pathway. M. oryzae Strains and Culture Conditions—M. oryzae strain Br48 isolated from wheat, Triticum aestivum (L.) Thell, was used as a recipient in transformation. The fungus was maintained on potato dextrose agar for several months. For long term storage, the fungus was cultured on barley seeds soaked with sucrose, dried, and kept at 4 °C as described previously (23Nakayashiki H. Kiyotomi K. Tosa Y. Mayama S. Genetics. 1999; 153: 693-703PubMed Google Scholar). For DNA or RNA isolation and protoplast preparation, M. oryzae was grown in CM liquid broth (0.3% casamino acids, 0.3% yeast extract, 0.5% sucrose) at 26 °C. Transformation of M. oryzae—Protoplast preparation and fungal transformation were performed as described previously (23Nakayashiki H. Kiyotomi K. Tosa Y. Mayama S. Genetics. 1999; 153: 693-703PubMed Google Scholar). Three plasmids, pSH75 (24Kimura N. Tsuge T. J. Bacteriol. 1993; 175: 4427-4435Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), pII99 (25Namiki F. Matsunaga M. Okuda M. Inoue I. Nishi K. Fujita Y. Tsuge T. Mol. Plant-Microbe Interact. 2001; 14: 580-584Crossref PubMed Scopus (207) Google Scholar), and pPTR-EGFP2, carrying the hygromycin B phosphotransferase gene, the neomycin phosphotransferase gene, and pyrithiamine resistance gene, respectively, were used as selective makers. For selection, hygromycin, Geneticin, and pyrithiamine were used at concentrations of 400, 800, and 0.1 μg/ml, respectively. For pyrithiamine screening, Czapek medium (0.05% MgSO4·7H2O, 0.1% K2HPO4, 0.05% KCl, 0.2% NaNO3, 0.0001% FeSO4·7H2O and 2% agar, pH 6.0) containing 20% sucrose was used as regeneration medium after transformation. Construction of Plasmid Vectors—Gene disruption vectors pMDL1-hph and pMDL2-hph targeting for the MDL-1 and MDL-2 genes, respectively, were constructed by inserting a hygromycin phosphotransferase gene (HPH) cassette into exons of those genes. For pMDL1-hph construction, a 3.0-kb fragment in the MDL-1 gene was amplified from genomic DNA with a pair of specific primers (5′-TTTGCGGCCGCCA-TGGAAGTTCACGATGGG-3′ and 5′-CCCGAATTCTCACCATCCGTC-TCGTCC-3′) and cloned into pBluescript SK+II. Then a HPH cassette amplified by PCR with the primers 5′-CCGCGGCCGCACGTTAACTG-ATATTGAAG-3′ and 5′-TTTGCGGCCGCAACCCAGGGCTGGTG-ACGG was inserted into a SmaI site located in the middle of the cloned MDL-1 fragment to establish pMDL1-hph. For pMDL2-hph construction, two adjacent fragments (2.1 and 3.0 kb) in the MDL-2 gene were separately amplified from genomic DNA by PCR with two pairs of specific primers having appropriate restriction sites at the 5′ terminus (for the 2.1-kb fragment, 5′-TTTGCGGCCGCTGTCGTCCCAGGAC-GAATC-3′ and 5′-CCCTCTAGAAGATGTTCGTTGATCAGTCC-3′; for 3.0-kb fragment, 5′-CCCTCTAGATCTTCCTATCCGGGAGTCTG-3′ and 5′-CTAAACCCCTTCCTCCAAAACTACCCC-3′). The PCR products were cloned into pBluescript SK+II in a one-by-one manner so that two fragments maintained correct orientation and order. The HPH cassette amplified by PCR as above was then inserted in the middle of the two fragments at the EcoRV site, resulting in pMDL2-hph. The silencing construct pEGFP-SA-neo was constructed by modifying pEGFP-SA that expressed hairpin RNA of the enhanced green fluorescence protein (EGFP) gene (22Kadotani N. Nakayashiki H. Tosa Y. Mayama S. Mol. Plant Microbe Interact. 2003; 16: 769-776Crossref PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar). A neomycin phosphotransferase gene (NPTII) cassette was amplified by PCR with specific primers containing NotI restriction sites (5′-CCGCGGCCGCACGTTAACTGATATTGAAG-3′ and 5′-TTTGCGGCCGCAACCCAGGGCTGGTGACGG-3′) and inserted into the NotI site of pEGFP-SA, resulting in pEGFP-SA-neo. pMDL2-NT-RV used for genetic complementation of the mdl-2 mutant was constructed by inserting a 7.4-kb EcoRV-NotI fragment derived from a cosmid T33H1 into pBluescript SK+II. The cosmid T33H1 was isolated by screening a cosmid library of M. oryzae Br48 with a 2.1-kb DNA fragment of the MDL-2 gene. Imaging and Measurements of GFP Fluorescence—The GFP fluorescence of transformant colonies on potato dextrose agar medium was measured by the ProXPRESS Proteomic Imaging System and ProFinder software (PerkinElmer) as described previously (22Kadotani N. Nakayashiki H. Tosa Y. Mayama S. Mol. Plant Microbe Interact. 2003; 16: 769-776Crossref PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar). The GFP fluorescence was detected using 485-nm excitation and 535-nm emission wavelengths. Southern and Northern Analysis—Fungal genomic DNA was extracted as described previously (23Nakayashiki H. Kiyotomi K. Tosa Y. Mayama S. Genetics. 1999; 153: 693-703PubMed Google Scholar). Southern blot analysis was performed using the dioxetane chemiluminescence system Gene Image™ (Amersham Biosciences). Genomic DNA was digested with an appropriate restriction enzyme(s), and the digests were transferred to Hybond N+ (Amersham Biosciences) after fractionation on a TAE-agarose gel. The hybridization and detection procedures were performed according to the manufacturer's instructions. Total RNA and low molecular weight RNA fractions were prepared as described previously (22Kadotani N. Nakayashiki H. Tosa Y. Mayama S. Mol. Plant Microbe Interact. 2003; 16: 769-776Crossref PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar). Briefly, frozen mycelia were homogenized with a mortar and a pestle in liquid N2. An equal volume (2 ml each) of extraction buffer (0.1 m LiCl, 0.1 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 10 mm EDTA, 1% SDS) and phenol (80 °C) were added to the mycelial powder in a tube. The homogenates were mixed with 2 ml of choloroform/isoamyl alcohol (24:1). The mycelial debris was then pelleted by centrifugation at 10,000 × g at 4 °C for 20 min. The supernatant was carefully removed and extracted twice with an equal volume of choloroform/isoamyl alcohol (24:1). Total RNA was precipitated from the aqueous phase with 1 volume of 4 m LiCl and recovered by centrifugation at 10,000 × g for 20 min. The pellet was washed with 70% ethanol and dried. Low molecular weight RNAs were prepared from total RNA as described by Dalmay et al. (26Dalmay T. Hamilton A. Mueller E. Baulcombe D.C. Plant Cell. 2000; 12: 369-379Crossref PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar). For mRNA detection, total RNA (20 μg) was separated on a 1.2% denaturing agarose gel. When dsRNA was a target for detection, total RNA was treated with S1 nuclease (Takara) at 37 °C for 3 h and precipitated with ethanol. The pellet was dissolved in 100% formamide, heated at 95 °C for 5 min, and then put on ice for 5 min before loading. After electrophoresis, RNA was transferred to Hybond NX (Amersham Biosciences). Prehybridization and hybridization were performed in ULTRAhyb™ (Ambion) or Perfect-Hyb buffer (Sigma) at 68 °C. [32P]dCTP-labeled probes were prepared by the random priming method. After hybridization, membranes were washed twice in 2× SSC (1× SSC: 0.15 m NaCl and 0.015 m sodium acetate) containing 0.2% SDS for 20 min at 68 °C and subsequently washed twice in 0.1× SSC containing 0.2% SDS for 20 min at 68 °C. For siRNAs analysis, low molecular weight RNA was separated on a 17.5% polyacrylamide, 7 m urea gel. After blotting onto Hybond NX, the hybridization was performed at 42 °C overnight with Perfect-Hyb buffer, and the membrane was washed twice at 50 °C in 2× SSC containing 0.2% SDS. DNA oligonucleotides (30-, 24-, and 20-mer) were used as molecular size makers. Equal loading of total RNA was estimated by ethidium bromide staining of rRNAs, predominant RNAs, or cleaved RNAs by S1 nuclease upon their availability. RT-PCR Analysis—Total RNA was isolated as described above. After treatment with RNase-free DNase followed by phenol extraction and ethanol precipitation, total RNA was reverse transcribed in a 20-μl reaction using ReverTra Ace (Toyobo) with the oligo(dT)15 primer. For PCR amplification, 1 μl of 5× diluted RT mix was used as a template. The PCR was carried out in 20 μl with 0.5 unit of rTaq DNA polymerase (Toyobo), 1.2 mm MgCl2, and 20 pmol of each primer. The PCR program was as follows: 10 min at 94 °C, 25 cycles of 45 s at 94 °C, 45 s at the optimal annealing temperature (50–65 °C), and 45 s at 72 °C, followed by 10 min at 72 °C. Sets of gene-specific primers used were as follows: MDL1-F (5′-AGCTGACTGGCTGATTGGTG-3′) and MDL1-R (5′-GT-CACGCATTTTCTGCTCGTTG-3′), MDL2-F (5′-TGGACTGATCAAC-GAACATC-3′) and MDL2-R (5′-GAAACTAGGGTCTGTACTAC-3′), B-TUB-F (5′-TTCCCCCGTCTCCACTTCTTCATG-3′) and B-TUB-R (5′-GACGAGATCGTTCATGTTGAACTC-3′). Sequence Analysis—Sequencing reactions were carried out using the ABI Prism Big-dye Terminator Ready Reaction sequence kit (Applied Biosystems) and analyzed with an ABI310 sequencer. The International Rice Blast Genome Consortium M. grisea data base (available on the World Wide Web at www.broad.mit.edu/annotation/fungi/Magnaporthe/) and BLAST program were used for data base searches. The Pfam server (available on the World Wide Web at www.sanger.ac.uk/Software/Pfam/) was used to search for conserved domains in the sequence. Multiple sequences of helicase and two RNase III domains were aligned using the ClustalW program (available on the World Wide Web at www.ebi.ac.uk/clustalw/), and phylogenetic analysis was performed. Identification of two M. oryzae Dicer Homologues and Construction of Mutants—Searches of the M. grisea data base (available on the World Wide Web at www.broad.mit.edu/annotation/fungi/Magnaporthe/) for Dicer-like proteins resulted in the identification of two possible candidates (MG01541.4 and MG07167.4), which we designated as MDL-1 and -2 (Magnaporthe Dicer-like-1 and -2, respectively). MDL-1 encodes a protein of 1658 amino acids exhibiting three distinct characteristic domains of Dicer: an N-terminal DEAD/DEAH box helicase, two C-terminal RNase III signatures, and a domain of unknown function DUF 283. MDL2 is a protein of 1485 amino acids also displaying the characteristic domains of Dicer, but the DUF 283 domain is weakly conserved in MDL2 (Fig. 1). In addition, both MDL1 and MDL2 harbor possible dsRNA binding domains at the C terminus, which show recognizable similarity to dsRNA binding domains found in other DCL proteins. Cluster analysis of conserved helicase and RNase III domains in DCL proteins revealed that MDL1 and MDL2 were most closely related to DCL1 and DCL2 in N. crassa, respectively, among known DCL proteins (data not shown). To examine the roles of MDL1 and MDL2 in the RNA silencing pathway in vivo, mutations in each gene were constructed by homologous recombination. Two vectors containing HPH gene cassette insertions in the exons of either the MDL-1 or MDL-2 genes were constructed. Each vector was then transformed into the M. oryzae isolate Br48. Transformants were screened by PCR analysis for homologous recombination of the HPH cassette into either mdl-1 or mdl-2 (data not shown) and further analyzed by Southern blotting. Southern blots (Fig. 2, A and B) showed the integration of the vectors at the expected site. Two mutants each of MDL-1 (mdl1–4 and -10) and MDL-2 (mdl2–17 and mdl-36) were obtained. The mutants mdl1–4 and mdl2–36 were primarily used in further analyses and were designated as mdl-1 and mdl-2 mutants, respectively. To confirm that the disrupted genes in both mutants were not functional, expression of the MDL-1 and -2 genes was examined by RT-PCR using specific sets of primers as described under “Experimental Procedures.” The β-tubulin gene was used as an internal control. Fig. 2C showed MDL2 mRNA but not MDL1 mRNA in mdl-1, and MDL1 mRNA but not MDL2 mRNA in mdl-2 were detectable in this assay, indicating the loss of function of the MDL-1 gene in the mdl-1 mutant and of the MDL-2 gene in the mdl-2 mutant. To examine the effect of MDL1 and MDL2 on vegetative growth, colony growth assay was performed. Wild-type and mdl mutants were cultured on potato dextrose agar medium without antibiotics for 5 days in the absence of light, and colony sizes were subsequently measured. Slightly slower growth was observed with the mdl-2 mutant compared with wild-type at 22 and 30 °C but not at 20 °C (Table I). The growth rate of the mdl-1 mutant was equivalent to that of wild-type at any temperature examined.Table IGrowth of wild type and mdl mutants of M. oryzaeStrainColony size20 °C22 °C30 °CcmWild type1.77 ± 0.082.09 ± 0.093.10 ± 0.07mdl-11.71 ± 0.052.09 ± 0.113.16 ± 0.08mdl-21.69 ± 0.111.88 ± 0.13aSignificant difference by Student's t test (1%).2.94 ± 0.13aSignificant difference by Student's t test (1%).a Significant difference by Student's t test (1%). Open table in a new tab Disruption of MDL-2 but not MDL-1 Impaired RNA Silencing in M. oryzae—Gene silencing assays of the mdl mutants were performed by two steps of transformation. First, test strains were transformed with pEGF75 carrying the EGFP gene under control of the Aspergillus nidulans trpC promoter. After screening the resulting transformants for strong GFP fluorescence, pEGFP-SA-neo, carrying transcriptional units for the neomycin phosphotransferase gene as a selective maker and for hairpin RNA of the EGFP gene was introduced into the GFP-expressing transformants. After selection by antibiotics, double transformants containing pEGF75 and pEGFP-SA-neo were randomly selected, and their GFP fluorescence was measured using the image analyzer ProExpress (Applied Biosystems). Based on the intensity of GFP fluorescence, the double transformants were categorized into five classes, and the number in each class was represented in a graph (Fig. 3A). In the mdl-1 double transformants, loss of GFP fluorescence was observed at a frequency comparable with that in wild type. In contrast, loss of GFP fluorescence was barely detected in the mdl-2 double transformants. These results suggested that MDL2 but not MDL1 was involved in the RNA silencing pathway. However, there were some contradictory results (e.g. strong GFP fluorescence was observed in some mdl-1 double transformants and also in the wild-type strain). In addition, a few mdl-2 transformants showed a silenced phenotype. To address this, silenced (S in Fig. 3) and nonsilenced (N in Fig. 3) transformants were selected from each of the mdl-1, mdl-2, and wild-type strains, and Southern analysis was used to examine the integrated vectors pEGFP75 and pEGFP-SA-neo. Double digestion of the vectors with EcoRI and XbaI should give rise to 2.6- or 3.2-kb fragments containing transcriptional units of EGFP mRNA and hairpin RNA in pEGFP75 and pEGFP-SA-neo, respectively. Southern blots with EcoRI- and XbaI-digested genomic DNA and an EGFP probe indicated that the transcriptional units of both EGFP hairpin RNA and mRNA remained intact in the silenced transformants of mdl-1 and wild type. In the nonsilenced transformants, the 3.2-kb band corresponding to the intact transcription unit of EGFP hairpin RNA was not detected, indicating that integration of pEGFP-SA-neo might have occurred by interruption of a transcriptional unit or that some rearrangement might have occurred after the integration event. The 3.2-kb band was not present in all nonsilenced mdl-1 transformants examined. Those results indicated that the mdl-1 mutant have no phenotypic deficiency in the RNA silencing pathway triggered by hairpin RNA. In the mdl-2 mutant, the 2.6- and 3.2-kb fragments were detected in most of the nonsilenced transformants (Fig. 3B), indicating that the nonsilenced phenotype of the transformants was not due to the loss of the transcription units of EGFP hairpin RNA but probably due to a deficiency in the RNA silencing pathway. One double transformant of the mdl-2 mutant showed a complete silenced phenotype (Fig. 3A). Southern analysis revealed that the 2.6-kb band corresponding to the transcription unit of EGFP mRNA was absent in the transformant. Therefore, it was likely that the silenced phenotype of the transformant was simply attributed to the loss of the EGFP gene but not to RNA silencing. In conclusion, the results obtained here indicated that mutation of MDL-2 but not MDL-1 impaired RNA silencing triggered by hairpin RNA in M. oryzae. MDL-2 Is Essential for dsRNA Dicing—To determine the biochemical roles of MDL1 and MDL2 in the RNA silencing pathway, siRNA production and mRNA accumulation were examined by Northern analyses. GFP-expressing transformants with or without the intact silencing construct pEGFP-SA-neo were employed with different genetic backgrounds of wild-type, mdl-1, and mdl-2. Accumulation of EGFP siRNAs was induced by introducing the silencing construct in the wild-type and mdl-1 transformants and not in the mdl-2 transformants, consistent with the idea that MDL2 processed dsRNA into siRNAs in M. oryzae (Fig. 4A). Of note, no siRNA accumulation was detectable in the mdl-2 mutant even when the blot was overexposed (Fig. 4A). This is in contrast to previous reports on DCL mutants in other organisms, where a low level of siRNA accumulation was detectable even in mutants of DCL proteins that were mainly responsible for siRNA production (16Catalanotto C.

As with the previous phenotypic assay, a drastic decrease in EGFP mRNA accumulation by the silencing construct was observed with wild-type and mdl-1 backgrounds (Fig. 4B). However, in the mdl-2 transformant, no decrease in EGFP mRNA accumulation was observed by the silencing construct. This probably was due to the lack of EGFP siRNA accumulation in the mdl-2 transformant, which led to loss of a sequence-specific guide for EGFP mRNA degradation in the RISC complex. To confirm that the absence of EGFP siRNAs in the mdl-2 transformant was attributed to a deficiency in the dicing process of hairpin RNA but not due to inhibition of hairpin RNA expression, further Northern analysis was performed to detect a"

The two ubiquitous isoforms of this protease, calpain I and II, are considered to be cytosolic proteins that can translocate to various sites in the cell. The activity of calpain is modulated by two regulatory proteins, calpastatin, the specific endogenous inhibitor of calpain, and the 28-kDa regulatory subunit. Using velocity gradient centrifugation, the results of this study confirm and greatly expand upon our previous finding that the calpain/calpastatin network is associated with the endoplasmic reticulum and Golgi apparatus in cells. Moreover, confocal microscopy demonstrates that calpain II colocalizes with specific proteins found in these organelles. Additional experiments reveal that hydrophobic rather than electrostatic interactions are responsible for the association of the calpain/calpastatin network with these organelles. Treatment of the organelles with Na2CO3 or deoxycholate reveal that calpain I, 78-kDa calpain II, and the regulatory subunit are “embedded” within the organelle membranes similar to integral membrane proteins. Proteinase K treatment of the organelles shows that calpain I and II, calpastatin, and the regulatory subunit localize to the cytosolic surface of the organelle membranes, and a subset of calpain II and the regulatory subunit are also found within the lumen of these organelles. These results provide a new and novel explanation for how the calpain/calpastatin network is organized in the cell.

Thompson V.F. Li H. Wei W. Cong J. Physiol. Rev. 2003; 83: 731-801Crossref PubMed Scopus (2305) Google Scholar). The major isoforms of Cp, Cp I and Cp II, are heterodimers composed of an 80-kDa catalytic subunit and an identical 28-kDa regulatory subunit (Rs). The Cp I and Cp II isoforms differ not only in the amino acid sequence of the catalytic subunits but in their in vitro Ca2+ requirements for activation. Thus, Cp I (μ-calpain) requires 3-50 μm Ca2+, whereas 0.2-1.0 mm of Ca2+ is required for activation of Cp II (m-calpain) (2Croall D.E. DeMartino G.N. Physiol.

These increases in [Ca2+]i also induce translocation of Cp from the cytosol to the plasma membrane (PM) and focal adhesions, contacts, or clusters (3Mellgren R.L.

Lauffenburger D.A. Wells A. Trends Cell Biol. 2002; 12: 46-54Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (320) Google Scholar). Although the ability of Cp to move within the cell is well known, the spatial and temporal aspects governing the subcellular positioning of the Cp/Cs network remain undefined. Using confocal microscopy and velocity gradient centrifugation, the current study was undertaken to expand upon our previous observation that Cp, the Rs, and Cs associate with the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) and Golgi apparatus (GA) (27Hood J.L. Logan B.B. Sinai A.P. Brooks W.H. Roszman T.L. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2003; 310: 1200-1212Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). The results show a differential association of Cp I, Cp II, Cs, and the Rs with the ER and GA as a result of hydrophobic rather than electrostatic interactions. Moreover, Cp II and the Rs appear to not only be associated with these cytosolic side of these membranes but also in the lumen of the organelles. Positioning of the Cp/Cs network within the ER and GA affords a focal environment capable of facilitating activation in the presence of elevated [Ca2+]i, providing a means of protease regulation and access to substrates.

All other reagents were purchased from Sigma. Confocal Microscopy—Confluent cells were detached from the flask using 0.5% trypsin-EDTA, resuspended in serum-free medium, and pelleted at 1500 rpm at 4 °C. The cells were stained with trypan blue and counted using a hemocytometer. Cells (50,000/ml) were allowed to settle and adhere to glass coverslips in 6-well plates for 24 h at 37 °C under 5% CO2. After incubation, cells were washed three times with PBS (pH 7.4) to remove nonadherent cells and fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde in PBS (pH 7.4) for 30 min at room temperature. After fixation, cells were washed three times in PBS (pH 7.4) to remove excess paraformaldehyde, permeabilized with 0.1% Triton X-100 in PBS (pH 7.4) for 10 min at room temperature, washed three times in PBS (pH 7.4) to remove excess Triton X-100, and blocked for 10 min at room temperature in PBS (pH 7.4) containing 1% bovine serum albumin and 4% goat serum. Primary antibodies were added to the cells and incubated for 20 min, cells were washed three times in PBS (pH 7.4) to remove excess primary antibody, and appropriate secondary fluorescent antibodies (Alexa 488 or Alexa 594) were added. Cells were washed three times with phosphate-buffered saline (pH 7.4) to remove background fluorescent staining, and coverslips containing cells were removed from the 6-well plates and mounted on glass slides using the ProLong antifade kit according to the manufacturer's protocol. Coverslips were allowed to dry for 24 h and visualized using a Leica confocal microscope under ×1000 magnification and Leica imaging software. Enrichment of ER and GA Organelles by Optiprep Velocity Gradients—The ER and GA subcellular compartments isolated as previously described were separated on Optiprep (Axis-Shield, Oslo, Norway) velocity gradients (28Tekirian T.L.

Briefly, cells were cultured for 24 h at 37 °C and harvested using 0.5% trypsin EDTA. Cells were resuspended in RPMI 1640 medium and pelleted at 1800 × g for 15 min. Cell pellets were resuspended in 4 ml of isotonic cell transfer (ICT) homogenization medium (78 mm KCl, 4 mm MgCl2, 8.37 mm CaCl2, 10 mm EGTA, 50 mm Hepes/KOH, pH 7.0, 1 mm PMSF, and Complete protease inhibitor mixture (Roche Applied Science)) and passaged 10 times through an ice-cold ball bearing homogenizer with a 12-μm clearance. The resulting cell lysate was spun at 1500 × g for 20 min at 4 °C to remove nuclei and debris. The pellet was discarded, and the postnuclear supernatant (PNS) containing organelles was removed and set aside. A 10-25% continuous Optiprep gradient diluted in 0.75% NaCl, 10 mm Tris, 3 mm KCl, and 1 mm EDTA was generated by a Gradient Master (BioComp Instruments, Inc.). A protein assay was performed on the PNS, and 1.5 mg of PNS was loaded to the top of the gradient. The gradient was spun in an SW40 Ti rotor for 18 h at 27,700 rpm (100,000 × g) and 4 °C. After centrifugation, 12 1.0-ml fractions (heavy to light density) were collected from the bottom of the gradient using a Dynamax RP-1 peristaltic pump (Rainin). The protein from each fraction was precipitated by incubation with 10% trichloroacetic acid for 30 min at 4 °C. The protein precipitates were recovered by centrifugation at 16,000 × g for 20 min. Pellets were washed two times with acetone to remove the trichloroacetic acid and resuspended in 300 μl of Laemmli's sample buffer. Samples were heated to 80 °C and vortexed three times, and 10 μl of each sample was loaded onto a 4-20% Tris-HCl polyacrylamide gel (Bio-Rad) and analyzed by Western blotting using nitrocellulose membrane.

The microsomal pellet was resuspended in 200 μl of 50 mm Tris buffer, pH 7.4, and 0.25 mg of control or sample microsomes were resuspended in 1.5 ml of 50 mm Tris buffer, pH 7.4. The following five samples were prepared: 100 mm NaCl, 100 mm KCl, 10 mm EDTA, 10 mm EGTA, or both 10 mm EDTA and 10 mm EGTA. The samples and control microsomes were incubated with rotation at 37 °C for 1 h. After incubation, treated microsomes were spun at 100,000 × g in a TLA 100.3 rotor for 1 h at 4 °C, the supernatant was discarded, and the pellets were rinsed in 50 mm Tris buffer, pH 7.4, and solubilized in 250 μl of Laemmli's sample buffer.

Samples were heated to 80 °C and vortexed three times, and 10 μl of each sample was loaded onto a 4-20% Tris-HCl polyacrylamide gel and analyzed by Western blotting using nitrocellulose membrane. Subcellular Localization of Cp II in Cells as Determined by Confocal Microscopy—The association of Cp II with subcellular organelles was determined by confocal microscopy experiments utilizing A-549 lung adenocarcinoma cells cultured for 24 h on glass slides and subsequently immunostained. The initial series of experiments examined the relationship between Cp II and the ER using the trans-membrane protein chaperone calnexin (29Bergeron J.J.M. Brenner M.B. Thomas D.Y. Williams D.B. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1994; 19: 124-128Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (455) Google Scholar) or the lumenal protein chaperone Grp 78/KDEL (30Cotner T. Pious D. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 2379-2386Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar) (Fig. 1). Cells probed with antibodies to Cp II and calnexin showed diffuse staining throughout the cell but with considerable colocalization of these two proteins (Fig. 1A). Conversely, colocalization of Cp II and Grp 78/KDEL is more focal and intense, particularly in the perinuclear region (Fig. 1B). These results suggest that Cp II is associated with the cytoplasmic face of the ER as well as the ER lumen in A-549 cells. Similar experiments were performed to determine the relationship between Cp II with either COPβ, a COP I vesicle coat protein (31Duden R. Mol. Membr. Biol. 2003; 20: 197-207Crossref PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar), or P230, a protein associated with the GA (32Kjer-Nielsen L. van Vliet C. Erlich R. Toh B.-H. Gleeson P.A. J. Cell Sci. 1999; 112: 1645-1654Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) (Fig. 2). Cells stained with antibodies to Cp II or COPβ show diffuse staining with extensive colocalization. (Fig. 2A). The most prominent feature of this colocalization was the appearance of intensely stained vesicles. This suggests that Cp II associates with the COP I/II vesicle system comprising the ER to GA intermediate compartment (ERGIC) and provides a potential means for Cp II transport between the ER and GA. Cp II also colocalizes with the GA marker P230 (Fig. 2B). The P230 staining of the GA appears perinuclearly with prominent punctuate colocalization. Collectively, these results indicate that Cp II associates with the ERGIC and GA in A-549 cells. Association of Cp and Its Regulatory Proteins with the ER and GA as Determined by Velocity Gradient Centrifugation—To confirm and extend the results obtained with confocal microscopy indicating the association of Cp with subcellular organelles, PNS prepared from A-549 cells was subjected to Optiprep velocity gradient centrifugation. The resulting organelle fractions obtained from the gradient were subjected to Western analysis using antibodies to proteins associated with the ER, ERGIC, and GA (Fig. 3). The results show that the GA resides primarily in gradient fractions 8 and 9 as demonstrated by reactivity to antibodies against mannosidase II, a specific marker for the medial to trans-GA (33Moremen K.W. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2002; 1573: 225-235Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). The trans-GA-associated 14-3-3 protein (28Tekirian T.L. Merriam D.E. Marshansky V. Miller J. Crowley A.C. Chan H. Ausiello D. Brown D. Buxbaum J.D. Xia W. Wasco W. Mol. Brain Res. 2001; 96: 14-20Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar) resided in fractions 9-11 of the gradient, whereas ribophorin II, an ER-resident protein (34Fu J. Pirozzi G. Sanjay A. Levy R. Chen Y. De Lemos-Chiarandini C. Sabatini D. Kreibich G. Eur. J. Cell Biol. 2000; 79: 219-228Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar), was detected in gradient fractions 3-7. COPβ was distributed throughout the gradient, with the majority detected in fractions 8 and 9, corresponding to the location of the GA. Because COPβ is involved in the trafficking of proteins and lipids between the ER and GA, it is expected that this protein should be found in both the ER and GA (31Duden R. Mol. Membr. Biol. 2003; 20: 197-207Crossref PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar). Additionally, because the size and buoyancy of vesicles transported by COPβ vary greatly it is not unreasonable to find COPβ throughout the gradient. However, for the purposes of analysis, the ERGIC will be defined as the COPβ-containing compartment, fractions 7 and 8, with a buoyant density between that of the ER and GA. Fraction 12 is defined as containing those cellular compartments, vesicles/PM, with buoyant densities less than that of the trans-GA. The presence of Cp and its regulatory proteins in the gradient fractions was determined by Western analysis (Fig. 3). The results show that Cp I is found predominantly in fraction 9, with smaller amounts detected in fractions 7, 8, 10, and 11, indicating that Cp I is primarily associated with the GA. The distribution of Cp II is quite different in that this isoform is detectable throughout the gradient. Interestingly, the 80-kDa form of Cp II is found in all gradient fractions, whereas the 78-kDa form is predominant in fractions 6-12. Moreover, the ratio of the 80-kDa to the 78-kDa forms of Cp II is dependent on their association with the different organelles. Accordingly, only the 80-kDa Cp II is detected in the densest region of the gradient (fractions 1-3). Appreciable amounts of the 78-kDa form of Cp II initially are observed in the ERGIC (fractions 7 and 8) and exceed that of the 80-kDa form in the GA and vesicle/PM fractions. These data suggest that the 80-kDa form of Cp II may undergo conversion to the 78-kDa form within the GA. Both the Rs and Cs are found distributed throughout the gradient, but the greatest concentration of these proteins extends from the ERGIC to the vesicle/PM fractions of the gradient (fractions 7-12). It is noteworthy that the Rs and Cs also are present in gradient fractions 7-12 concurrent with the appearance of the 78-kDa form of Cp II, thereby suggesting a potential site for regulation of Cp activity. Electrostatic Association of Cp and Its Regulatory Proteins with Organelle Membranes—Having demonstrated differential compartmentalization of Cp and its regulatory proteins with the ER, ERGIC, and GA, the next set of investigations were designed to begin to determine the mechanism(s) of this association. To explore the possibility that the association of Cp, Rs, and Cs with the ER and GA is dependent on electrostatic interactions, microsomes were prepared from A-549 cells and treated with either NaCl or KCl or the divalent metal ion chelators EDTA or EGTA (Fig. 4). The results reveal no observable changes in binding of Cp I, Cp II, or the Rs to microsomes after treatment with NaCl or KCl. Similarly, the association of these proteins with microsomes was not altered after treatment with the divalent metal chelator EDTA or the more Ca2+-specific chelator EGTA. Interestingly, a modest decrease in the 110-kDa form of Cs was noted in all treatment groups but not for the other breakdown products of Cs. These results indicate that the association of the Cp/Cs network with organelles is not dependent on electrostatic interactions. T"

However, cisplatin, a DNA damage-inducing chemotherapeutic agent, is thought to regulate p73 only by affecting its stability through mechanisms involving the MLH-1/c-Abl signaling cascade. Here we show that c-Jun, a component of the AP-1 family of transcription factors, contributes to p73 induction by cisplatin. c-jun–/– cells are defective in p73 induction, and ectopic c-Jun expression augments p73 levels. c-Jun-mediated accumulation of p73 requires the transactivation activity of c-Jun and occurs in a c-Abl- and Mdm2-independent manner. c-Jun expression increases p73 half-life by preventing it from proteasome-mediated degradation, resulting in the potentiation of p73-mediated transcriptional activity. Moreover, mouse fibroblasts lacking c-Jun are resistant to cisplatin-induced apoptosis, and reintroduction of c-Jun restores p73 activation and sensitivity to cisplatin. Furthermore, p73-mediated apoptosis is abrogated in c-jun–/– cells. Together, these findings demonstrate a possible role for c-Jun in regulating p73 function and highlight the importance of the cooperativity between transcription factors in potentiating apoptosis.

Together, these findings demonstrate a possible role for c-Jun in regulating p73 function and highlight the importance of the cooperativity between transcription factors in potentiating apoptosis. Many stress signals and chemotherapeutic agents activate the c-Jun NH2-terminal kinase signaling pathway leading to the activation of c-Jun, a major component of the mammalian Jun protein family that includes JunB and JunD (1Shaulian E. Karin M. Nat. Cell Biol. 2002; 4: E131-E136Crossref PubMed Scopus (2173) Google Scholar). c-Jun, together with the Fos proteins, form the set of dimers belonging to the AP-1 family of DNA-binding proteins (1Shaulian E. Karin M. Nat. Cell Biol. 2002; 4: E131-E136Crossref PubMed Scopus (2173) Google Scholar). c-Jun is a central component of all AP-1 complexes, which act often as transcriptional activators (2Karin M. Liu Z. Zandi E. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1997; 9: 240-246Crossref PubMed Scopus (2289) Google Scholar). c-Jun is required for a variety of biological processes that influence oncogenic transformation including cell differentiation, proliferation, and apoptosis (3Jochum W. Passegue E. Wagner E.F. Oncogene. 2001; 20: 2401-2412Crossref PubMed Scopus (595) Google Scholar). Its expression is elevated in response to many stimuli, including 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate, growth factors, cytokines, chemotherapeutic drugs, UV irradiation, and other stress stimuli (4Leppa S. Bohmann D. Oncogene. 1999; 18: 6158-6162Crossref PubMed Scopus (440) Google Scholar). Fibroblasts lacking c-jun have severe proliferation defects and are resistant to several forms of stress-induced apoptosis (5Johnson R.S. van Lingen B. Papaioannou V.E. Spiegelman B.M. Genes Dev. 1993; 7: 1309-1317Crossref PubMed Scopus (343) Google Scholar, 6Schreiber M. Kolbus A. Piu F. Szabowski A. Mohle-Steinlein U. Tian J. Karin M. Angel P. Wagner E.F.

Wagner E.F. Nat. Genet. 1999; 21: 326-329Crossref PubMed Scopus (594) Google Scholar). It has been shown that Fas ligand is a transcriptional target of c-Jun, contributing to some forms of c-Jun-mediated cell death (8Behrens A. Sibilia M. Wagner E.F. Nat. Genet. 1999; 21: 326-329Crossref PubMed Scopus (594) Google Scholar, 9Eichhorst S.T. Muller M. Li-Weber M. Schulze-Bergkamen H. Angel P. Krammer P.H. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 7826-7837Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar). However, the detailed mechanisms by which c-Jun regulates apoptosis is not well understood. Many chemotherapeutic agents that activate c-Jun also often induce both p53-dependent and -independent cell death (10Siddik Z.H. Oncogene. 2003; 22: 7265-7279Crossref PubMed Scopus (2596) Google Scholar, 11Manson M.M. Holloway K.A. Howells L.M. Hudson E.A. Plummer S.M. Squires M.S. Prigent S.A. Biochem. Soc. Trans. 2000; 28: 7-12Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). These agents have been shown to activate p73, a structural and functional homologue of p53 (12Gong J. Costanzo A. Yang H.Q. Melino G.

Cancer. 2002; 2: 605-615Crossref PubMed Scopus (501) Google Scholar). In addition, the use of an alternative promoter in the intron 3 of the p73 gene leads to the expression of a p73 protein that lacks the NH2-terminal transactivation domain (ΔNp73) (17Pozniak C.D. Radinovic S. Yang A. McKeon F. Kaplan D.R. Miller F.D. Science. 2000; 289: 304-306Crossref PubMed Scopus (406) Google Scholar). The full-length p73 isoforms have been shown to have tumor-suppressive properties because ectopic overexpression in cell lines often leads to p53-independent apoptosis and suppression of colony formation (15De Laurenzi V. Costanzo A. Barcaroli D. Terrinoni A. Falco M. Annic-chiarico-Petruzzelli M. Levrero M. Melino G. J. Exp. Med. 1998; 188: 1763-1768Crossref PubMed Scopus (361) Google Scholar, 18Jost C.A. Marin M.C. Kaelin Jr., W.G. Nature. 1997; 389: 191-194Crossref PubMed Scopus (898) Google Scholar). The c-Abl tyrosine kinase appears to play a central role in DNA damage-induced activation of p73 and consequent cell death (12Gong J. Costanzo A. Yang H.Q. Melino G. Kaelin W.G. Levrero M. Wang J.Y. Nature. 1999; 399: 806-809Crossref PubMed Scopus (831) Google Scholar, 13Costanzo A. Merlo P. Pediconi N. Fulco M. Sartorelli V. Cole P.A. Fontemaggi G. Fanciulli M. Schiltz L. Blandino G. Balsano C. Levrero M. Mol. Cell. 2002; 9: 175-186Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (278) Google Scholar). Upon DNA damage, activated c-Abl has been shown to bind to the PXXP motif of p73 and phosphorylate on tyrosine residue 99 and to a lesser extent, on residues 121 and 240 (19.Agami, R., Blandino, G., Oren, M., and Shaul, Y. (1999) 399, 809–813Google Scholar, 20Tsai K.K. Yuan Z.M. Cancer Res. 2003; 63: 3418-3424PubMed Google Scholar). p73 was not activated in c-Abl–/– cells, and hence, these cells were found to be resistant to DNA damage-induced cell death (12Gong J. Costanzo A. Yang H.Q. Melino G. Kaelin W.G. Levrero M. Wang J.Y. Nature. 1999; 399: 806-809Crossref PubMed Scopus (831) Google Scholar). Moreover, we have recently shown that multiple stress signals activate p73, resulting in cell death, and that p73–/– cells are resistant to apoptosis induced by these stress signals (21Lin K.W. Nam S.Y. Toh W.H. Dulloo I. Sabapathy K. Neoplasia. 2004; 6 (in press)Google Scholar). Hence, activation of p73 appears to contribute to another line of defense against stress signals, in the absence of p53. Although p73 is able to induce apoptosis when overexpressed, p73-mediated transactivation of many p53-responsive promoters, including the apoptotic targets, is less efficient compared with p53-mediated transactivation (22Zhu J. Jiang J. Zhou W. Chen X. Cancer Res. 1998; 58: 5061-5065PubMed Google Scholar). This raises the possibility that expression of p73 alone might not be sufficient to execute cell death. In this regard, it is noteworthy that p73 null mice do not develop spontaneous tumors as do their p53 null counterparts (23Yang A. Walker N. Bronson R. Kaghad M. Oosterwegel M. Bonnin J. Vagner C. Bonnet H. Dikkes P. Sharpe A. McKeon F. Caput D. Nature. 2000; 404: 99-103Crossref PubMed Scopus (880) Google Scholar), reinforcing the idea that p73 might be a weaker tumor suppressor of the two, and it might require the cooperation of other apoptosis activators. c-Jun has been shown to negatively regulate transcription of both p53 and its target, the cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor, p21, thereby antagonizing p53-mediated growth suppression (6Schreiber M. Kolbus A. Piu F. Szabowski A. Mohle-Steinlein U. Tian J. Karin M. Angel P. Wagner E.F. Genes Dev. 1999; 13: 607-619Crossref PubMed Scopus (461) Google Scholar, 24Shaulian E. Schreiber M. Piu F. Beeche M. Wagner E.F. Karin M. Cell. 2000; 103: 897-907Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Hitherto, it is not evident whether c-Jun has any role in regulating p73 function. We report here that c-Jun contributes to the increase in p73 half-life by preventing it from proteasome-mediated degradation, thus resulting in p73 induction and potentiation of p73-mediated cell death. These findings demonstrate a critical role for c-Jun in regulating p73 function. Cell Culture and Transfections—COS7, H1299, and all mouse fibroblasts were cultured as described (6Schreiber M.

Oncogene. 2002; 21: 2441-2445Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). c-jun–/– cells were infected with c-Jun retroviral particles derived from a pBabe-c-Jun construct as described (6Schreiber M. Kolbus A. Piu F. Szabowski A. Mohle-Steinlein U. Tian J. Karin M. Angel P. Wagner E.F. Genes Dev. 1999; 13: 607-619Crossref PubMed Scopus (461) Google Scholar) and selected on puromycin for stable infectants. These c-jun–/– + c-jun cells were used as controls with the c-jun–/– cells. Transfections were performed by using LipofectAMINE reagent as per the manufacturer's instructions. The total amounts of transfected DNA were equalized with appropriate amounts of pCDNA3 vector in all cases. pCDNA3-based expression plasmids for p73α, p73β, ΔNp73α, and ΔNp73β have been described (15De Laurenzi V. Costanzo A. Barcaroli D. Terrinoni A. Falco M. Annic-chiarico-Petruzzelli M. Levrero M. Melino G. J. Exp. Med. 1998; 188: 1763-1768Crossref PubMed Scopus (361) Google Scholar). Point mutations of p73α and p73β were generated using the site-directed mutagenesis kit as per the manufacturer's instructions (Stratagene), and c-Jun mutants were generated by standard molecular biological techniques. Transfected cells were harvested 48 h post-transfection for analysis of proteins and RNA. The cells were treated with cisplatin with the indicated amounts and harvested for protein and cell survival analysis. Immunoblot and Immunoprecipitation Analysis—The cells lysates were prepared in lysis buffer containing 0.5% Nonidet P-40 as described (26Sabapathy K. Hu Y.L. Kallunki T. Schreiber M. David J.P. Jochum W. Wagner E.F. Karin M. Curr. Biol. 1999; 11: 116-125Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (270) Google Scholar). The proteins were separated on SDS-polyacrylamide gels and Western blotted with anti-p73α (ER15; Oncogene), anti-p73β (GC15; Oncogene), anti-c-Jun (H79, Santa Cruz; G56–206, Pharmingen), anti-Actin (Sigma), and anti-Egfp (Clontech) antibodies. The specificity of the p73 antibodies are described by Lin et al. (21Lin K.W. Nam S.Y. Toh W.H. Dulloo I. Sabapathy K. Neoplasia. 2004; 6 (in press)Google Scholar). Generally, 150 μg of lysate was used from transfected cells to monitor steady-state levels of proteins. In the following cases, 300 μg of total cell extracts were used: Figs. 1C and 2B.Fig. 2Ectopic c-Jun expression increases the steady-state levels of p73. A, c-jun–/– and c-jun–/–+ c-jun mouse embryonic fibroblasts were transfected with plasmids encoding p73β (1.0 μg) and egfp (0.3 μg). In each case, total amount of transfected DNA were equalized with pCDNA3 vector. The cells were harvested 48 h after transfection and subjected to immunoblot analysis as indicated. B, COS7 cells were transfected transiently with the transactivation proficient or deficient p73α or p73β isoforms (1.0 μg) without or with c-jun (1.0 μg) or the pCDNA3 empty vector as indicated. In each case, total amount of transfected DNA were brought up to 2.3 μg with pCDNA3 vector. The cells were harvested 48 h after transfection and subjected to Western blot analysis with both p73α- and p73β-specific antibody (ER-15 and GC15, respectively) and c-Jun-specific antibody. The asterisks indicate the detection of endogenous p73β in c-jun transfected cells. C, COS7 cells were transfected with the indicated plasmids encoding p73α, egfp, and c-jun at the indicated concentrations and were analyzed as described in B. D, COS7 cells were transfected with the indicated point mutants of the p73α or p73β without or with c-jun (1.0 μg) and were analyzed as described above. E, levels of p73β and glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (gapdh) RNA were determined in the above cells as in B.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) The half-life of p73 was determined by starving cells in methionine/cysteine-free minimum essential medium for 1 h, followed by labeling in minimum essential medium with 300 μCi ml–1 of [35S]methionine (ICN) for 2 h. After washing away the [35S]methionine with 1× phosphate-buffered saline, the cells were chased with normal Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium for different lengths of time. The lysates were prepared as described earlier. 500 μg of lysate was immunoprecipitated overnight with anti-p73β antibody and separated on a 12% SDS-PAGE and analyzed as described (26Sabapathy K.

The amount of 35S in p73 was quantified by phosphorimaging. RNA Analysis—Total RNA was prepared from cells using the TRI Reagent (Sigma) as per the manufacturer's instructions. Reverse transcriptase-PCR and Northern blot analysis were performed using total RNA as described (21Lin K.W. Nam S.Y. Toh W.H. Dulloo I. Sabapathy K.

Full-length p73 PCR was performed using a forward 5′-TCTGGAACCAGACAGCACCT-3′ primer and a reverse 5′-GTGCTGGACTGCTGGAAAGT-3′ primer under the following conditions, as described (21Lin K.W. Nam S.Y. Toh W.H. Dulloo I. Sabapathy K. Neoplasia. 2004; 6 (in press)Google Scholar). Luciferase Assays—Transient transfections of H1299 and the indicated mouse fibroblasts were generally performed with 10 ng of expression plasmids for p73β and c-jun, the mdm2-luc plasmid, or the PG13-luc plasmid (0.5 μg) together with 0.5 μg plasmid encoding the β-galactosidase gene for evaluating the transfection efficiency. The cells were collected 48 h post-transfection. Luciferase assays were performed as described (27Sabapathy K. Klemm M. Jaenisch R. Wagner E.F. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 6217-6229Crossref PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar, 28Funk W.D. Pak D.T. Karas R.H. Wright W.E. Shay J.W. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1992; 12: 2866-2871Crossref PubMed Scopus (675) Google Scholar). Apoptosis Assays—Cisplatin-treated cells were analyzed for cell death by staining with Annexin-V fluorescein isothiocyanate as per the manufacturer's instructions and analyzed by flow cytometry as described (25Hochedlinger K. Wagner E.F. Sabapathy K. Oncogene. 2002; 21: 2441-2445Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). Cell death analysis of transfected cells (1.0 μg of p73 in the presence or absence of 1.0 μg of c-Jun expression plasmids, together with 0.1 μg of Egfp encoding plasmid) was performed by sub-2N analysis of DNA content by staining ethanol-fixed cells with propidium iodide. DNA content of Egfp-positive cells were determined by flow cytometry. Visual inspection of the Egfp-positive cells was performed by conventional fluorescence microscopy. c-Jun Is Required for Cisplatin-induced p73 Accumulation—We have recently shown that multiple stress signals activate p73, both through the induction of p73 mRNA and through the prolongation of p73 half-life (21Lin K.W. Nam S.Y. Toh W.H. Dulloo I. Sabapathy K. Neoplasia. 2004; 6 (in press)Google Scholar). Among them, the chemotherapeutic drug cisplatin, which has been shown by several groups to induce p73 protein (12Gong J. Costanzo A. Yang H.Q. Melino G. Kaelin W.G. Levrero M. Wang J.Y. Nature. 1999; 399: 806-809Crossref PubMed Scopus (831) Google Scholar), was not able to induce p73 mRNA (Fig. 1A and Ref. 12Gong J. Costanzo A. Yang H.Q. Melino G. Kaelin W.G. Levrero M. Wang J.Y. Nature. 1999; 399: 806-809Crossref PubMed Scopus (831) Google Scholar). This was in contrast to Taxol, another chemotherapeutic drug that was able to activate p73 mRNA (Fig. 1A). Cisplatin treatment leads to activation of a plethora of signaling modules, including the c-Jun NH2-terminal kinase signaling cascade that regulates c-Jun (29Sanchez-Perez I. Perona R. FEBS Lett. 1999; 453: 151-158Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). Because c-jun–/– cells are resistant to cisplatin-induced cell death (29Sanchez-Perez I. Perona R. FEBS Lett. 1999; 453: 151-158Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar), we examined whether c-Jun is a critical determinant of cisplatin-induced p73 activation. Treatment of wild-type mouse fibroblasts with cisplatin resulted in a time-dependent increase in the levels of c-Jun protein, indicating that c-Jun is activated by cisplatin (Fig. 1B). Immunoblot analysis using a p73β-specific antibody that is able to recognize endogenous human, mouse, and simian p73β (21Lin K.W. Nam S.Y. Toh W.H. Dulloo I. Sabapathy K. Neoplasia. 2004; 6 (in press)Google Scholar) revealed that exposure to cisplatin for 24 h induced expression of p73 in c-jun–/– mouse embryonic fibroblasts stably re-expressing a single copy of c-jun by retroviral infection (c-jun–/– + c-jun cells) but not in cells lacking c-Jun, demonstrating that c-Jun can potentiate p73 expression upon cisplatin treatment (Fig. 1C). Although basal p53 levels were elevated in c-jun–/– cells as previously reported and re-expression of c-Jun led to a decrease in p53 basal levels (6Schreiber M. Kolbus A. Piu F. Szabowski A. Mohle-Steinlein U. Tian J. Karin M. Angel P. Wagner E.F. Genes Dev. 1999; 13: 607-619Crossref PubMed Scopus (461) Google Scholar), p53 was induced in both the cell types by cisplatin (Fig. 1C). Together, the results indicate that c-Jun contributes to the accumulation of endogenous p73 protein. c-Jun Expression Increases Steady-state p73 Levels—Because p73 induction appears to be dependent on c-Jun, we further examined whether p73 expression was altered by the absence of c-Jun. Immunoblot analysis revealed that the levels of transiently transfected p73β expression was much reduced in c-jun–/– fibroblasts as compared with the c-jun–/– + c-jun cells (Fig. 2A, compare lanes 2–5). Transient expression of c-Jun together with p73 in c-jun–/– fibroblasts resulted in higher levels of p73 expression (Fig. 2A, compare lanes 2 and 3). In addition, expression of c-Jun with p73 in jun–/– + c-jun cells led to the highest levels of p73 expression (Fig. 2A, lane 6), indicating that the presence of c-Jun affected the levels of ectopically expressed p73. In contrast, the status of c-Jun did not affect the levels of green fluorescent protein (Egfp), which was used to normalize the transfection efficiency (Fig. 2A). We assessed the effect of c-Jun overexpression on steady-state p73 levels in an attempt to investigate the mechanism by which c-Jun regulates p73 expression. Monkey COS7 cells were transiently transfected with the expression plasmids for c-Jun either alone or together with p73α or p73β, and p73 levels were determined by Western blotting 48 h later. Ectopic expression of c-Jun alone led to the accumulation of endogenous p73β, as indicated by the asterisk, as compared with cells transfected with “empty” vector (Fig. 2B, compare lanes 1 and 2). Moreover, co-expression of equal amounts (1.0 μg) of c-Jun with p73α or p73β resulted in a significant increase in the steady-state levels of p73 compared with expression of p73 alone (Fig. 2B, compare lanes 3 and 7 for p73α and compare lanes 4 and 8 for p73β). This accumulation was seen in several other human cell lines (H1299, MCF-7, and 293 cells; data not shown). Using various amounts of both p73α and c-Jun expression plasmids, we observed that c-Jun overexpression led a dose-dependent accumulation of p73α (Fig. 2C) and p73β (data not shown). In contrast, expression of c-Jun did not affect the levels of Egfp, which was used to normalize the transfection efficiency (Fig. 2C). We next investigated the domains of p73 that are required for c-Jun-mediated increase in steady-state levels. Transfection of the expression constructs for ΔNp73α and ΔNp73β, the anti-apoptotic proteins that lack the NH2-terminal transactivation domain, with c-Jun expression construct did not lead to increased expression of these proteins, as compared with their full-length counterparts (Fig. 2B, compare lanes 5 and 9, 6 and 10, 3 and 7, and 4 and 8), suggesting that the NH2 terminus of p73 is required for c-Jun-mediated p73 accumulation. However, co-expression with c-Jun led to the accumulation of two p73 mutants that have been shown to be defective in c-Abl-mediated p73 stability, namely the 338-p73 (which is defective in c-Abl binding) and the 99-p73 (which cannot be phosphorylated by c-Abl) (Fig. 2D), indicating that c-Jun-mediated p73 accumulation is probably independent of the pathway by which the tyrosine kinase c-Abl stabilizes p73. Furthermore, the increased levels of p73 in the presence of c-Jun was not due to increased p73 transcription, because co-expression of c-Jun with p73β did not affect the levels of p73 RNA (Fig. 2E), further suggesting that c-Jun-mediated p73 accumulation occurs at a post-transcriptional level. Together, the results demonstrate that the overexpression of c-Jun can lead to a substantial increase in the amount of p73 in human and monkey cells, which appears not to be dependent on the binding and phosphorylation of p73 by c-Abl. The Transactivation Domain of c-Jun Is Required for p73 Accumulation—To determine the mechanism by which c-Jun contributes to p73 accumulation, we determined whether c-Jun could be co-immunoprecipitated with p73. Several strategies to evaluate protein-protein interactions failed to reveal reciprocal binding between c-Jun and p73 (data not shown). We therefore determined the critical domains of c-Jun that were required for increasing p73 steady-state levels. To this end, the following expression plasmids were generated: transactivation domain deficient c-Jun (TAM67) (30Dong Z. Crawford H.C. Lavrovsky V. Taub D. Watts R. Matrisian L.M. Colburn N.H. Mol. Carcinog. 1997; 19: 204-212Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar), deletion mutant of c-Jun that does not have the COOH-terminal DNA-binding and leucine zipper domains that are required for DNA-binding and oligomerization with other transcription factors, respectively (Δ195–331), and a mutant that only expresses the COOH terminus of c-Jun containing the DNA-binding domain and the leucine zipper domains (Δ1–244) (Fig. 3A). Co-expression of p73β with increasing amounts of these mutants, unlike full-length c-Jun, did not cause an increase in the steady-state levels of p73β (Fig. 3B). The transactivation and DNA-binding domains together appear to be critical for c-Jun-mediated p73 accumulation, because c-Jun mutants expressing the DNA-binding domain without the transactivation domain (TAM-67) or the Δ195–331 mutant that lacks the DNA-binding domain but retains the transactivation domain were unable to increase p73 levels (Fig. 3B). Expression of the DNA-binding and leucine zipper domains of c-Jun (1–244) alone was also not sufficient to increase p73 levels (Fig. 3B). The data together suggest that the transactivation property of c-Jun is required for 73 accumulation. c-Jun Prolongs p73 Half-life—Intracellular p73 levels were shown to be regulated by c-Abl at the level of protein stability (12Gong J. Costanzo A. Yang H.Q. Melino G. Kaelin W.G. Levrero M. Wang J.Y. Nature. 1999; 399: 806-809Crossref PubMed Scopus (831) Google Scholar). To assess whether the effect of c-Jun is mediated through interference with the proteasomal degradation of p73, we first evaluated the effect of the proteasomal inhibitor MG132 on endogenous p73. Treatment of wild-type fibroblasts with MG132 resulted in the increase of endogenous p73, indicating that p73 is indeed degraded through the proteasomal pathway (Fig. 4A). c-Jun was also stabilized by MG132 treatment, as has been reported earlier (31Fuchs S.Y. Dolan L. Davis R.J. Ronai Z. Oncogene. 1996; 13: 1531-1535PubMed Google Scholar). In addition, MG132 treatment of COS7 cells transiently transfected with p73β resulted in increased levels of p73 expression in cells transfected with p73 alone, which was comparable with the levels obtained in the presence of c-Jun (Fig. 4B, compare lane 3 with lanes 4 and 7). MG132, however, did not elicit a further increase in p73 beyond the levels induced by c-Jun (Fig. 4B, compare lanes 4 and 8). This suggests that c-Jun and MG132 mediate p73 accumulation through similar mechanisms, namely by inhibiting the proteasomal degradation of p73. To investigate whether c-Jun can stabilize p73, cells transfected with p73β in the absence or presence of c-Jun were pulse-labeled with [35S]Met/Cys followed by a 4-h chase. Transiently expressed p73 had a half-life of about 1.5 h (Fig. 4C, p73). When p73 was co-expressed with c-Jun, about 60% of p73 remained at the end of the 4-h chase period (Fig. 4C, p73 + c-Jun). To further confirm that p73 stability is dependent on c-Jun expression upon cisplatin treatment, the half-life of p73 was determined in wild-type and c-jun–/– cells. Pulse-chase experiments indicated that p73 has a half-life of approximately 1 h in wild-type fibroblasts (Fig. 4D). In contrast, p73 was less stable in c-jun–/– cells with a much shorter half-life, and almost all the p73 protein had disappeared by 1 h (Fig. 4D). Together, these data suggest that c-Jun regulates the accumulation of p73 by controlling protein stability. p73 Transcriptional Activity Is Potentiated by c-Jun—To assess whether c-Jun-mediated p73 stability affects the transactivation function of p73, reporter assays were performed in H1299 cells with constructs containing the luciferase gene driven by the p53/p73 responsive mdm2 promoter (mdm2luc) or the multimerized consensus p53 binding site (PG13). Co-transfection of the mdm2luc with a vector expressing c-Jun had only a slight effect on luciferase activity (Fig. 5A, left panel). By contrast, co-transfection of the reporters with 10 ng of the p73β expression vector resulted in the activation of luciferase activity, which was potentiated by co-expression with c-Jun. The elevated level of p73 activity in the presence of c-Jun was comparable with the activity of higher amounts of p73β (100 ng) (Fig. 5A, left panel). Similar results were obtained using the PG13-luc construct (Fig. 5A, right panel). RNA analysis indicated that co-expression of c-Jun with p73β potentiated the expression of endogenous p53AIP-1 (Fig. 5B), an apoptotic target gene that is induced by p73 (13Costanzo A. Merlo P. Pediconi N. Fulco M. Sartorelli V. Cole P.A. Fontemaggi G. Fanciulli M. Schiltz L. Blandino G. Balsano C. Levrero M. Mol. Cell. 2002; 9: 175-186Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (278) Google Scholar), further demonstrating that expression of c-Jun leads to enhanced p73 activity. Furthermore, analysis of transfected p73 activity was assessed in mouse fibroblasts lacking p53 alone or those lacking both c-Jun and p53. Expression of p73β resulted in activation of luciferase activity in p53–/– fibroblasts, which was compromised in the absence of c-Jun (Fig. 5C, right panel), i"

However, the intracellular signaling pathways triggered by anaphylatoxins are not well understood. Here we report for the first time that sphingosine kinase (SPHK) plays a key role in C5a-triggered signaling, leading to physiological responses of human neutrophils. We demonstrate that C5a rapidly stimulates SPHK activity in neutrophils and differentiated HL-60 cells. Using the SPHK inhibitor N,N-dimethylsphingosine (DMS), we show that inhibition of SPHK abolishes the Ca2+ release from internal stores without inhibiting phospholipase C or protein kinase C activation triggered by C5a but has no effect on calcium signals triggered by other stimuli (FcγRII). We also show that DMS inhibits degranulation, activation of the NADPH oxidase, and chemotaxis triggered by C5a. Moreover, an antisense oligonucleotide against SPHK1, in neutrophil-differentiated HL-60 cells, had similar inhibitory properties as DMS, suggesting that the SPHK utilized by C5a is SPHK1. Our data indicate that C5a stimulation decreases cellular sphingosine levels and increases the formation of sphingosine-1-phosphate. Exogenously added sphingosine has a dual effect on C5a-stimulated oxidative burst: it has a priming effect at lower concentrations but a dose-dependent inhibitory effect at higher concentrations; however, C5a-triggered protein kinase C activity was only reduced at high concentration of sphingosine. In contrast, C5a-triggered Ca2+ signals, chemotaxis, and degranulation were not affected by sphingosine at all. Exogenous sphingosine-1-phosphate, by itself, did not induce degranulation or chemotaxis, but it did marginally induce Ca2+ signals and oxidative burst and had a priming effect, enhancing all the C5a-triggered responses. Taken together, these results suggest that SPHK plays an important role in the immune-inflammatory pathologies triggered by anaphylatoxins in human neutrophils and point out SPHK as a potential therapeutic target for the treatment of diseases associated with neutrophil hyperactivation.

Activation of the complement cascade plays a key role in host defense. However, anaphylatoxins produced after the activation of the complement system are associated with a variety of pathologies, including septic shock, adult respiratory distress syndrome, and immune complex-dependent diseases such as rheumatoid arthritis (1Smedegard G.

Immunogenicity is a problem, and proteins are expensive to manufacture, very susceptible to degradation by proteases in serum or gastrointestinal tract, and generally display poor pharmacokinetic properties. More recently, attempts have been made to produce smaller molecules that are more stable, cheaper to make, have better bioavailability, and are more attractive as drug candidates for treating human diseases mediated by C5a (14Wong A.K.

However, very little is known about the intracellular signaling pathways activated by C5a in immune effector cells. During the last few years, it has become clear that sphingo-lipids, in addition to being structural constituents of cell membranes, are sources of important signaling molecules. In particular, the sphingolipid metabolites, ceramide and sphingosine-1-phosphate (SPP), 1The abbreviations used are: SPP, sphingosine-1-phosphate; SPHK, sphingosine kinase; IP3, inositol-1,4,5-trisphosphate; DMS, N,N-dimethylsphingosine; fMLP, formylmethionylleucylphenylalanine; PKC, protein kinase C.1The abbreviations used are: SPP, sphingosine-1-phosphate; SPHK, sphingosine kinase; IP3, inositol-1,4,5-trisphosphate; DMS, N,N-dimethylsphingosine; fMLP, formylmethionylleucylphenylalanine; PKC, protein kinase C. have emerged as a new class of potent bioactive molecules implicated in a variety of cellular processes such as cell differentiation, apoptosis, and proliferation (16Hannun Y.A.

Interest in SPP focused recently on two distinct cellular actions of this lipid, namely, the function of SPP as an extracellular ligand activating specific G protein-coupled receptors and the role of SPP as an intracellular second messenger (20Meyer zu Heringdorf D. van Koppen C.J. Jakobs K.H. FEBS Lett. 1997; 410: 34-38Crossref PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar). Several findings enforced the notion of SPP as an important intracellular second messenger. First, activation of various plasma membrane receptors, such as the platelet-derived growth factor receptor (21Olivera A. Spiegel S.

Second, inhibition of sphingosine kinase stimulation strongly reduced or even prevented cellular events triggered by these receptors, such as receptor-stimulated DNA synthesis, Ca2+ mobilization, and vesicular trafficking (21Olivera A.

We have used primary human neutrophils and differentiated HL-60 cells (a human neutrophil cell model) to better understand the intracellular molecular mechanisms responsible for C5a-triggered physiological events and to identify key molecules as candidates for novel therapeutic intervention. Here we report for the first time that the anaphylatoxin C5a activates the intracellular signaling molecule sphingosine kinase and present data that support the role for sphingosine kinase in the physiological responses triggered by C5a in human neutrophils, showing that inhibition of this enzyme has potential anti-inflammatory properties. We demonstrate that C5a receptor activation rapidly stimulates sphingosine kinase activity in primary human neutrophils and neutrophil-differentiated HL-60 cells. Moreover, inhibition of sphingosine kinase by N,N-dimethylsphingosine (DMS) does not affect phospholipase C stimulation or protein kinase C (PKC) activation triggered by C5a, but it largely inhibits C5a-stimulated Ca2+ mobilization, enzyme release, chemotaxis, and NADPH activation from both primary neutrophils and differentiated HL-60 cells. Furthermore, an antisense oligonucleotide specific for sphingosine kinase (SPHK) 1, transfected to the HL-60 cells, also inhibited the responses triggered by C5a. Interestingly, DMS had no effect calcium signals triggered by another stimulus (FcγRII). We also show here that C5a stimulation decreases cellular sphingosine levels and increases the formation of SPP; this may suggest a role for SPHK in removing a negative regulator (sphingosine) and generating a positive regulator (SPP), as has been suggested for mast cell activation (27Prieshl E.E. Csonga R. Novotny V. Kikuchi G.E. Baumruker T. J. Exp. Med. 1999; 190: 1-8Crossref PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar). Thus, we studied the effects of exogenously added sphingosine and SPP; we found that sphingosine has a dual effect on C5a-stimulated NADPH oxidase activation: it has a priming effect at lower concentrations but has a dose-dependent inhibitory effect at higher concentrations. On the other hand, C5a-triggered PKC activity was only reduced at high concentrations of sphingosine. C5a-triggered Ca2+ signals, chemotaxis, and degranulation were not affected by sphingosine at all. SPP, by itself, did not induce degranulation or chemotaxis, but it did marginally induce Ca2+ signals and the oxidative burst. However, SPP showed a priming effect, enhancing all C5a-triggered responses. Thus, our data contribute not only to the understanding of the intracellular molecular mechanisms utilized by C5a, suggesting that SPHK plays a key role in anaphylatoxin-triggered physiological functions, but also point out SPHK as a novel candidate for therapeutic intervention to treat inflammatory diseases. All materials, unless stated otherwise, were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich (Singapore). Isolation of Primary Human Neutrophils—Neutrophils were purified from healthy donors as described previously (28Smith W.B. Gamble J.R. Clark-Lewis I. Vadas M.A. Immunology. 1991; 72: 65-72PubMed Google Scholar). Briefly, this was done using dextran sedimentation, followed by density gradient centrifugation with Lymphoprep (Nycomed) and hypotonic lysis of erythrocytes. Cells were resuspended in assay medium (RPMI 1640 medium with 10 mm HEPES and 2.5% fetal calf serum) before use. Cytological examination of stained centrifuged preparations showed that 95% of the cells were neutrophils. Trypan blue staining confirmed that >98% of these cells were viable. After purification, the cells (2 × 106 cells/ml) were resuspended in RPMI 1640 medium supplemented with 2.5% fetal calf serum and allowed to recover for 30 min at 37 °C in a 5% CO2 atmosphere. For experiments, the cells were left untreated or pretreated with DMS (10 μm) for 20 min before stimulation. HL-60 Cell Culture and Differentiation to Neutrophil-like Cells—HL-60 cells were grown in RPMI 1640 medium supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum, 150 units/ml penicillin, and 150 μg/ml streptomycin at 37 °C in 5% CO2. Differentiation into neutrophil-like cells was induced by culturing HL-60 cells for 48 h in the presence of 0.5 mm dibutyril cyclic AMP, followed by an additional 48 h of differentiation in the presence or absence of antisense oligonucleotides and 0.5 mm dibutyril cyclic AMP. C5a Stimulation—Cells (2 × 106 cells/ml) resuspended in RPMI 1640 medium supplemented with 2.5% fetal calf serum, untreated or pretreated with DMS (10 μm), sphingosine (at the concentrations indicated in Fig. 9), or SPP (10 μm) for 20 min or antisense oligonucleotides for 48 h, were stimulated by the addition of 1 μm C5a and incubated at 37 °C for the times indicated in each figure. Sphingosine-1-phosphate Generation in Whole Cells—SPP generation was measured by assaying the amount of intracellular SPP generation after receptor activation as described previously (25Melendez A. Floto R.A. Gillooly D.J. Harnett M.M. Allen J.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 9393-9402Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (166) Google Scholar). Briefly, cells were preincubated overnight in media containing [3H]serine (2 μCi/ml) to label cellular sphingolipids and free sphingosine pools. After labeling, the cells were stimulated by the addition of C5a and warming to 37 °C, and the reactions were terminated at specified times. Lipids were extracted and analyzed by TLC on Silica Gel G60. Standard sphingosine 1-phosphate was applied with the samples, and the lipids were visualized using iodine vapors. Bands corresponding to sphingosine-1-phosphate were excised from the plate and counted by liquid scintillation spectrometry. Results were calculated as a percentage of the total radioactivity incorporated in the lipids. Sphingosine Kinase Activity—After C5a stimulation, activation of sphingosine kinase was measured as described previously (24Melendez A.J. Khaw A.K. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 17255-17262Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar, 29Melendez A. Floto R.A. Cameron A.J. Gillooly D.J. Harnett M.M. Allen J.M. Curr. Biol. 1998; 8: 210-221Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) in total cell lysates. Briefly, cells were resuspended in ice-cold 0.1 m phosphate buffer (pH 7.4) containing 20% glycerol, 1 mm mercaptoethanol, 1 mm EDTA, phosphatase inhibitors (20 mm ZnCl2, 1 mm sodium orthovanadate, and 15 mm sodium fluoride), protease inhibitors (10 μg/ml leupeptin, 10 μg/ml aprotinin, and 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride), and 0.5 mm 4-deoxypyridoxine and disrupted by freeze-thawing. Lysates were assayed for sphingosine kinase activity, based on the SPHK-catalyzed transfer of the γ-phosphate group of ATP (using a mixture of cold ATP and [γ32P]ATP (1 μCi/sample)) to a specific substrate, and the products were separated by TLC on Silica Gel G60 (Whatman) and visualized by autoradiography. The radioactive spots corresponding to sphingosine phosphate were scraped and counted in a scintillation counter. Phospholipase C Activity—After stimulating the cells with C5a for the indicated times, inositol-1,4,5-trisphosphate (IP3) was measured as described previously (24Melendez A.J. Khaw A.K. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 17255-17262Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar), using the BIOTRAK TRK 1000 kit (Amersham Biosciences). Briefly, the system is based on the competitive binding of cellularly formed IP3 and a known amount of radiolabeled IP3 to the IP3 receptor. Cytosolic Calcium Measurement—Cytosolic calcium was measured as described previously (24Melendez A.J. Khaw A.K. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 17255-17262Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar). Briefly, cells were loaded with 1 μg/ml Fura-2/AM (Molecular Probes) in PBS, 1.5 mm Ca2+, and 1% bovine serum albumin. After removal of excess reagents by dilution and centrifugation, the cells were resuspended in 1.5 mm Ca2+-supplemented PBS and warmed to 37 °C in the cuvette; after the basal line was obtained, the cells were stimulated by the addition of C5a. Fluorescence was measured at 340 and 380 nm, and the background-corrected 340: 380 ratio was calibrated as described previously (24Melendez A.J. Khaw A.K. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 17255-17262Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar). Degranulation/Enzyme Release—After C5a stimulation, β-glucorinidase release from neutrophils and neutrophil differentiated HL-60 cells was measured as described previously (26Alemany R. zu Henringdorf D.M. van Koppen C.J. Jacobs K.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 3994-3999Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). Enzyme release is measured as a percentage of the total cellular enzyme content. Chemotaxis Assay—Chemotaxis was assayed using the Chemicin QCM™ Chemotaxis 3 μm 96-well Cell Migration Assay kit (catalog no. ECM 515) following the manufacturer's instructions. Briefly, the assay is based on the 3-μm pore size of Boyden chambers. Cells are placed in the upper chamber, and 5 nm C5a is placed in the lower chamber, and cells are incubated at 37 °C for 2 h. Migratory cells found on the lower chamber are collected, and migratory cells attached on the bottom of the insert membrane are dissociated from the membranes with the Cell Detachment Buffer provided. These cells are subsequently lysed and detected using the CyQuant GR dye (Molecular Probes) provided in the kit. This green fluorescent dye exhibits strong fluorescence enhancement when bound to cellular nucleic acids. The number of migratory cells is determined by running a fluorescent cell dose curve, in which a known number of cells are lysed and detected using the CyQuant GR dye to generate a standard curve. NADPH Oxidative Burst Assays—Whole cell superoxide production after C5a stimulation was measured in primary neutrophils and differentiated HL-60 cells. Cells were assayed using an enhanced luminol-based substrate (DIOGENES, National Diagnostics) added to the cells at the same time as C5a (1 μm), and luminescence was measured using a luminometer (Wallac 1420 Multilabel counter). Western Blots—Unless otherwise stated, 40 μg of lysate for each sample was resolved on 12% polyacrylamide gels (SDS-PAGE) under denaturing conditions and then transferred to 0.45 μm nitrocellulose membranes. After blocking overnight at 4 °C with 5% nonfat milk in Tris-buffered saline and 0.1% Tween 20 and washing, the membranes were incubated with the relevant antibodies for 4 h at room temperature. The membranes were washed extensively in Tris-buffered saline/0.1% Tween 20 (washing buffer). The blots were probed using specific anti-SPHK1 polyclonal (made in house as described previously (21Olivera A. Spiegel S. Nature. 1993; 365: 557-560Crossref PubMed Scopus (814) Google Scholar)) and monoclonal anti-Arf1 (Santa Cruz Biotechnologies) primary antibodies. Bands were visualized using anti-rabbit horseradish peroxidase-conjugated and anti-mouse horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibodies and the ECL Western blotting detection system (Amersham Biosciences). Fluorescence Microscopy—After C5a stimulation, suspended cells were fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde and deposited on microscope slides in a cytospin centrifuge and then permeabilized for 5 min in 0.1% Triton X-100 in PBS. Fluorescence labeling was performed using the anti-SPHK1 polyclonal antibody made in house as described previously (21Olivera A. Spiegel S. Nature. 1993; 365: 557-560Crossref PubMed Scopus (814) Google Scholar) as primary antibody and an anti-rabbit, fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated secondary antibody. Staining was analyzed by fluorescence microscopy using a Leica DM IRB microscope, and images were captured using a Leica DC 300F camera. Antisense Knock-down of Sphingosine Kinase 1—The antisense down-regulation of SPHK1 was carried out as described previously (24Melendez A.J. Khaw A.K. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 17255-17262Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar). Antisense oligonucleotides were purchased from Oswell DNA Services; 20-mers were synthesized, capped at either end by the phosphorothioate linkages (the first two and the last two linkages), and corresponded to the reverse complement of the first 20 coding nucleotides for SPHK1; a scrambled oligonucleotide was used as a control. The sequences of the oligonucleotides were 5′-CCCGCAGGATCCATAACCTC-3′ (antisense) for SPHK1 and 5′-CTGGTGGAAGAAGAGGACGT-3′ (scrambled antisense) for control. Flow Cytometry for Cell Viability—Cell viability was detected by propidium iodide staining, which stains dead or dying cells. 100 μl of propidium iodide (catalog no. 1 348 639; Roche Diagnostics) was added to a 1-ml cell suspension containing 106 cells (final concentration of propidium iodide, 50 μg/ml) just before analysis using a Coulter EPICS-XL flow cytometer. PKC Activity—PKC enzyme activity was measured using the Biotrak Protein Kinase C enzyme assay system (Amersham Biosciences). Briefly, the system is based on the PKC-catalyzed transfer of the γ-phosphate group of ATP (using a mixture of cold ATP and [γ-32P]ATP (1 μCi/sample)) to a peptide substrate specific for PKC. After receptor stimulation, PKC assays were carried out. Results are expressed as phosphorylation rate per pmol of protein per minute. Sphingosine Levels—Sphingosine levels were analyzed as follows after C5a stimulation in cells pretreated or not pretreated with the antisense oligonucleotide to SPHK1: cells were preincubated overnight in media containing [3H]serine (2 μCi/ml) to label cellular sphingolipids and free sphingosine pools. After labeling, the cells were stimulated by the addition of C5a and warming to 37 °C, and the reactions were terminated at the specified times. Lipids were extracted and analyzed by TLC on Silica Gel G60 as described previously (25Melendez A. Floto R.A. Gillooly D.J. Harnett M.M. Allen J.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 9393-9402Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (166) Google Scholar). The sphingosine standard was applied to the samples to act as carrier and aid visualization of the lipid after TLC, and the lipids were visualized using iodine vapors. Bands corresponding to sphingosine were excised from the plate and counted by liquid scintillation spectrometry. Results were expressed as cpm per 2 × 106 cells. FcγRII (CD32) Aggregation/Stimulation.—FcγRII aggregation was carried out as described previously (29Melendez A. Floto R.A. Cameron A.J. Gillooly D.J. Harnett M.M. Allen J.M. Curr. Biol. 1998; 8: 210-221Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Briefly, cells were incubated at 5 °C, rocked for 45 min with a specific mouse monoclonal anti-CD32 antibody, and then washed to remove excess antibody. After that, anti-mouse IgG was added to the cells, which were incubated at 37 °C, and reactions were stopped at the indicated times. C5a Stimulates Sphingosine Kinase Activity in Human Neutrophils—We first investigated whether the C5a receptor would stimulate sphingosine kinase activity in primary human neutrophils and differentiated HL-60 cells (a human neutrophil model). Direct measurement of sphingosine kinase activity showed that the enzyme is activated after C5a receptor engagement in both the primary neutrophils and the HL-60 neutrophil model (Fig. 1A) and that this activation was inhibited in cells pretreated with DMS (Fig. 1A). After that, direct measurement of cellular SPP generation showed that SPP is generated after C5a receptor engagement in both the primary neutrophils and the HL-60 neutrophil model (Fig 1B) and that this SPP generation was inhibited in cells pretreated with DMS (Fig. 1B); the kinetics of SPP generation correlate with the kinetics for SPHK activity. These data show that the C5a receptor is capable of stimulating sphingosine kinase activity and the generation of intracellular SPP in both the primary neutrophils and the HL-60 neutrophil model. Role of Sphingosine Kinase on C5a-triggered Ca2+ Signals—Previous studies have demonstrated that sphingosine kinase mediates Ca2+ signals for several plasma membrane receptors (20Meyer zu Heringdorf D. van Koppen C.J. Jakobs K.H. FEBS Lett. 1997; 410: 34-38Crossref PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar, 21Olivera A. Spiegel S. Nature. 1993; 365: 557-560Crossref PubMed Scopus (814) Google Scholar, 22Bornfeldt K.E.

Kim J.H. Kinet J.P. Nature. 1996; 18: 634-636Crossref Scopus (385) Google Scholar), and because our results show that C5a triggers sphingosine kinase activity in human neutrophils, we decided to investigate the role of sphingosine kinase in C5a-triggered Ca2+ mobilization in these cells. C5a stimulation of primary neutrophils rapidly and transiently triggered calcium release from internal stores (Fig. 2A). However, in cells pretreated with DMS, the"
https://openalex.org/W2100721448,"The homo- and heterodimerization of Bcl-2 family proteins is important for transduction and integration of apoptotic signals and control of the permeability of mitochondria and endoplasmic reticulum membranes. Here we mapped the interface of the Bcl-2 homodimer in a cell-free system using site-specific photocross-linking. Bcl-2 homodimer-specific photoadducts were detected from 11 of 17 sites studied. When modeled into the structure of Bcl-2 core, the interface is composed of two distinct surfaces: an acceptor surface that includes the hydrophobic groove made by helices 2 and 8 and the loop connecting helices 4 and 5 and a donor surface that is made by helices 1-4 and the loop connecting helices 2 and 3. The two binding surfaces are on separate faces of the three-dimensional structure, explaining the formation of Bcl-2 homodimers, homo-oligomers, and Bcl-2/Bax hetero-oligomers. We show that <i>in vitro</i> the Bcl-2 dimer can still interact with activated Bax as a larger oligomer. However, formation of a Bax/Bcl-2 heterodimer is favored, since this interaction inhibits Bcl-2 homodimerization. Our data support a simple model mechanism by which Bcl-2 interacts with activated Bax during apoptosis in an effective manner to neutralize the proapoptotic activity of Bax."

The bacterial and eukaryotic GS form two distinct families lacking amino acid sequence homology. Moreover, the detailed kinetic mechanism of the bacterial and the eukaryotic GS remains unclear. Here we have overexpressed Arabidopsis thaliana GS (AtGS) in an Escherichia coli expression system and purified the recombinant enzyme for biochemical characterization. AtGS is functional as a homodimeric protein with steady-state kinetic properties similar to those of other eukaryotic GS. The kinetic mechanism of AtGS was investigated using initial velocity methods and product inhibition studies. The best fit of the observed data was to the equation for a random Ter-reactant mechanism in which dependencies between the binding of some substrate pairs were preferred. The binding of either ATP or γ-glutamylcysteine increased the binding affinity of AtGS for the other substrate by 10-fold. Likewise, the binding of ATP or glycine increased binding affinity for the other ligand by 3.5-fold. In contrast, binding of either glycine or γ-glutamylcysteine causes a 6.7-fold decrease in binding affinity for the second molecule. Product inhibition studies suggest that ADP is the last product released from the enzyme. Overall, these observations are consistent with a random Ter-reactant mechanism for the eukaryotic GS in which the binding order of certain substrates is kinetically preferred for catalysis.

Glutathione is a key modulator of the intracellular reducing environment that provides protection against reactive oxygen species and maintains protein thiols in a reduced state (1Meister A. Anderson M.E. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1983; 52: 711-760Crossref PubMed Scopus (5924) Google Scholar). In plants, metabolic pathways for the detoxification of herbicides (2May M.J. Vernoux T. Leaver C.

In the first reaction, glutamate-cysteine ligase (EC 6.3.2.2) catalyzes the ATP-dependent formation of the dipeptide γ-glutamylcysteine from cysteine and glutamate. Next, glutathione synthetase (GS, 1The abbreviations used are: GS, glutathione synthetase; AtGS, Arabidopsis thaliana glutathione synthetase; NTA, nitrilotriacetic acid; γEC, γ-glutamylcysteine. 1The abbreviations used are: GS, glutathione synthetase; AtGS, Arabidopsis thaliana glutathione synthetase; NTA, nitrilotriacetic acid; γEC, γ-glutamylcysteine.

Cleland W.W. Methods Enzymol. 1982; 87: 353-366Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). Here we report the expression and purification of AtGS and the basic biochemical characterization of this enzyme. To elucidate the kinetic mechanism of AtGS, we used a combination of initial velocity data collected as a function of varying substrate concentrations and product inhibition patterns to determine the order of substrate addition and product release (24Viola R.E.

Ni2+-nitrilotriacetic acid (NTA)-agarose was bought from Qiagen. Benzamidine-Sepharose and the HiLoad 26/60 Superdex-75 fast protein liquid chromatography column were from Amersham Biosciences. The BioMol Green reagent used for the detection of inorganic phosphate was purchased from BioMol Research Laboratories, Inc. All other reagents were purchased from Sigma and were of ACS reagent quality or better.Cloning and Generation of Expression Vectors—AtGS (GenBank™ accession number U22359) (26Wang C.-L. Oliver D.J. Plant Mol. Biol. 1996; 31: 1093-1104Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar) was amplified from an A. thaliana cDNA library using PCR with 5′-dTTTCCATGGCATGGGAATCACAGAAACCGATTTCG-3′ as the forward primer (NcoI site is underlined and the AtGS start codon is in bold) and 5′-dAGCGGCCGCTCAAATCAGATATATGCTGTCCAAGACTCC-3′ as the reverse primer (NotI site is underlined and the AtGS stop codon is in bold). Following NcoI and NotI restriction digests, the 1.4-kb PCR product was subcloned into NcoI/NotI digested pHIS8 bacterial expression vector (27Jez J.M. Ferrer J.L. Bowman M.E. Dixon R.A. Noel J.P. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 890-902Crossref PubMed Scopus (283) Google Scholar). Automated nucleotide sequencing confirmed the fidelity of the AtGS PCR product (Washington University Sequencing Facility).Expression in E. coli and Protein Purification—The pHIS8-AtGS bacterial expression construct was transformed into E. coli C41(DE3) cells. Transformed E. coli were grown at 37 °C in Terrific broth containing 50 μg ml–1 kanamycin until A600 nm∼0.8. After induction with 1 mm isopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside (IPTG), the cultures were grown at 20 °C for 4 h. Cells were pelleted by centrifugation and resuspended in lysis buffer (50 mm TRIS-HCl (pH 8.0), 500 mm NaCl, 20 mm imidazole, 5 mm MgCl2, 10% (v/v) glycerol, and 1% (v/v) Tween-20). After sonication and centrifugation, the supernatant was passed over a Ni2+-NTA column previously equilibrated with lysis buffer. The column was then washed with wash buffer (lysis buffer without Tween-20). His-tagged protein was eluted with elution buffer (wash buffer containing 250 mm imidazole (pH 8.0)). Incubation with thrombin (1/2000 the amount of AtGS by weight) during overnight dialysis at 4 °C against wash buffer removed the His-tag. Dialyzed protein was reloaded on a mixed benzamidine-Sepharose/Ni2+-NTA column. The flow-through of this step was dialyzed overnight against 30% (v/v) glycerol, 25 mm HEPES (pH 7.5), 5 mm MgCl2, and 100 mm NaCl, then loaded onto a HiLoad 16/60 Superdex-200 fast protein liquid chromatography column equilibrated in the same buffer without glycerol. Fractions containing AtGS were pooled, concentrated to 10 mg ml–1, and stored at –80 °C. Protein concentration was determined by the Bradford method (protein assay, Bio-Rad) with bovine serum albumin as standard.Enzyme Assays—The activity of AtGS was determined spectrophotometrically at 25 °C by measuring the rate of formation of ADP using a coupled assay with pyruvate kinase and lactate dehydrogenase (8Tanaka T.

A standard reaction mixture (0.5 ml) contained 100 mm HEPES (pH 7.5), 150 mm NaCl, 20 mm MgCl2, 2.5 mm γ-glutamylcysteine, 10 mm glycine, 2.5 mm disodium ATP, 2 mm sodium phosphoenolpyruvate, 0.2 mm NADH, 5 units of type III rabbit muscle pyruvate kinase, and 10 units of type II rabbit muscle lactate dehydrogenase. Reactions were initiated by adding AtGS (0.75 μg). The rate of decrease in A340 nm was followed using a Cary Bio300 UV/Vis spectrophotometer. Steady-state kinetic parameters were determined by initial velocity experiments. Measurements of the kcat and Km values for γ-glutamylcysteine (0.002–2.5 mm) were made at 10 mm glycine and 2.5 mm ATP. Kinetic constants for glycine (0.1–10 mm) were measured at 2.5 mm γ-glutamylcysteine and 2.5 mm ATP. Determination of the kinetic constants for ATP (0.002–2.5 mm) used 2.5 mm γ-glutamylcysteine and 10 mm glycine. Steady-state kinetic parameters were calculated using Kaleidagraph (Synergy Software) to fit the untransformed data to the Michaelis-Menten equation, v = kcat[S]/(Km + [S]).Analysis of the Kinetic Mechanism—Analysis of the kinetic mechanism of AtGS used global fitting analysis (28Brekken D.L. Phillips M.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 26317-26322Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar, 29Emanuele J.J. Jin H. Yanchunas J. Villafranca J.J. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 7264-7271Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). Reaction rates were measured using standard assay conditions in a matrix of substrate concentrations (γ-glutamylcysteine, 0.01–2.5 mm; ATP, 0.01–2.5 mm; glycine, 0.1–10 mm). Thus, the rate measured for any given substrate concentration is measured over the entire range of the other two substrates. Global curve fitting in SigmaPlot (Systat Software, Inc.) was used for modeling of the kinetic data to rapid equilibrium rate equations describing the possible Ter-reactant kinetic mechanisms (30Meierjohann S. Walter R.D. Müller S. Biochem. J. 2002; 363: 833-838Crossref PubMed Google Scholar).Product Inhibition Assays—Initial velocities in the presence of glutathione or phosphate were determined spectrophotometrically using the standard assay system. Enzymatic activity was determined after the addition of AtGS (0.75 μg) to solutions containing inhibitor and varied concentrations of γ-glutamylcysteine (0.01–2.5 mm), glycine (0.1–10 mm), or ATP (0.01–2.5 mm). Varied concentrations of glutathione (0, 5, 10, 25, or 50 mm) and potassium phosphate (0, 10, or 25 mm) were used. Assays with added phosphate (1.5 μg AtGS) contained MnCl2 at a 1:1 ratio with ATP and no added MgCl2 to prevent precipitation of magnesium phosphate at high phosphate concentrations.In the presence of added ADP, initial rates were measured by colorimetric determination of inorganic phosphate. Each 0.1-ml assay mixture contained 100 mm HEPES (pH 7.5), 150 mm NaCl, 20 mm MgCl2, varied substrate concentrations (as above), and ADP (0, 0.1, 0.25, 1, or 5 mm). The reaction was initiated by addition of AtGS (0.5 μg) and quenched at several time intervals (0–5 min) with 1 ml of BioMol Green reagent. Reaction rates were linear over the time course monitored. Control reactions were used to correct for background levels of inorganic phosphate in the reaction mixture. Color was measured at A620 nm and quantified with a standard curve for inorganic phosphate (0–8 nmol).Global fitting analysis in the kinetics module of SigmaPlot (Systat Software, Inc.) was used to simultaneously fit all data to the equations for competitive inhibition, v = Vmax/(1 + ((Km/[S])(1 + [I]/Ki))), non-competitive inhibition, v = Vmax/((1 + [I]/Ki)(1 + Km/[S])), and uncompetitive inhibition, v = Vmax/(1 + [I]/Ki + Km/[S]).RESULTSExpression and Purification of AtGS—AtGS was overexpressed in E. coli C41(DE3) as octahistidine-tagged protein and purified to apparent homogeneity using Ni2+ affinity and size exclusion chromatography (Fig. 1). By SDS-PAGE analysis, purified recombinant AtGS migrated with a monomer weight of ∼50 kDa, which corresponds to the predicted molecular weight (53.4 kDa). Matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization mass spectrometry of purified AtGS confirmed the identity of the protein and verified the molecular weight (not shown). AtGS eluted from the size exclusion column as a 90-kDa species representing the physiologic dimer. Unlike previous efforts to express AtGS in a bacterial expression system (18Wang C.-L. Oliver D.J. Biochem. J. 1997; 322: 241-244Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar, 19Wang C.-L. Oliver D.J. Biochem. J. 1997; 326: 563-566Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar), we did not observe any protein degradation during purification. Purified recombinant AtGS had a specific activity of 7.5 μmol min–1 mg protein–1 using standard assay conditions. The recombinant protein was stable for three months at –80 °C and for 24 h at 4 °C (with a loss of 25% activity after 72 h at 4 °C). Typical yields were ∼2 mg of pure protein per liter of culture.Steady-state Kinetic Analysis of AtGS—Steady-state kinetic parameters (kcat and Km) for γ-glutamylcysteine, glycine, and ATP were determined for AtGS (Table I). Similar values were obtained using the colorimetric assay for the detection of inorganic phosphate (not shown). Purified recombinant AtGS displayed Km values similar to those reported for the partially purified GS (KmγEC = 0.022 mm and KmGly = 0.31 mm) assayed in tobacco cell homogenates (17Hell R. Bergmann L. Physiol. Plant. 1988; 72: 70-76Crossref Scopus (84) Google Scholar). However, the reaction rate was 2000-fold higher because of the greater purity of the AtGS sample. The kcat and Km values determined for each substrate of AtGS were equivalent to those reported for the yeast (12Dodd-Mooz E. Meister A. Biochemistry. 1967; 6: 1722-1734Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar), human (22Njalsson R. Carlsson K. Olin B. Carlsson B. Whitbread L. Polekhina G. Parker M.W. Norgren S. Mannervik B.

J. 2002; 363: 833-838Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) enzymes. Compared with the E. coli GS (8Tanaka T. Kato H. Nishioka T. Oda J. Biochemistry. 1992; 31: 2259-2265Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar), the Km values of AtGS for both γ-glutamylcysteine and ATP were 10-fold lower, and the turnover rate was 10-fold slower. In place of magnesium, manganese (2.5 mm MnCl2) supported enzymatic activity with 2- to 3-fold reductions in kcat and no changes in Km for each substrate compared with those determined with MgCl2.Table ISteady-state kinetic parameters of AtGSkcatKmkcat/Kms-1μmm-1 s-1γEC12.2 ± 0.339 ± 5312,800Glycine12.6 ± 0.31510 ± 888,340ATP12.1 ± 0.557 ± 10212,300 Open table in a new tab Because different plants also synthesize a range of glutathione analogs in which glycine is substituted by another amino acid (4Zenk M.H. Gene (Amst.). 1996; 179: 21-30Crossref PubMed Scopus (886) Google Scholar), we examined the substrate specificity of AtGS. Assays containing ATP, γ-glutamylcysteine, and either β-alanine, serine, or glutamate showed no enzymatic activity (10 and 50 mm substrate; 100 μg AtGS).Initial Velocity Analysis of the Kinetic Mechanism—Initial velocity kinetic studies were performed by varying two of the three substrates while holding the third substrate constant under identical reaction conditions (24Viola R.E. Cleland W.W. Methods Enzymol. 1982; 87: 353-366Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar, 25Segel I.H. Enzyme Kinetics: Behavior and Analysis of Rapid Equilibrium and Steady-State Enzyme Systems.

Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 7264-7271Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). Six families of data were generated such that for a saturating concentration of one substrate the reaction rates were measured over the entire range of the other two substrates. Double reciprocal plots of the experimental data are presented in Fig. 2. Any potential ping-pong kinetic mechanisms were eliminated from further consideration because the reciprocal plots for each family of substrate data converge.Fig. 2Kinetic mechanism of AtGS. Experimental data are indicated by the symbols in the reciprocal plots of the initial velocity experiments. The lines shown represent the global fit of all data to the equation for a random Ter-reactant system. Parameters of the fit are listed in Table II. The square of the correlation coefficient (r2) for the global fit of all displayed data is 0.993. The following conditions were used for each set of assays: A, 2.5 mm γ-glutamylcysteine (γEC); 0.01–2.5 mm ATP; and 0.1, 0.25, 0.5, 1.0, 2.5, or 10 mm glycine (top to bottom).

Enzyme Kinetics: Behavior and Analysis of Rapid Equilibrium and Steady-State Enzyme Systems. John Wiley & Sons, Inc., New York1975Google Scholar). These included six potential ordered mechanisms, nine possible partially ordered/random mechanisms, and a random kinetic mechanism. Computerized simultaneous fitting of the initial velocity data provides a robust analysis of the data compared with earlier reciprocal re-plotting approaches (24Viola R.E. Cleland W.W. Methods Enzymol. 1982; 87: 353-366Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar, 29Emanuele J.J. Jin H. Yanchunas J. Villafranca J.J.

Based on global fits to the initial velocity data, the best fit (r2 = 0.993) was obtained using the equation of a random Ter-reactant system (Equation 1). vVmax=[ATP][Gly][γEC]αβγKATPKGlyKγEC1+[ATP]KATP+[Gly]KGly+[γEC]KγEC+[ATP][Gly]γKATPKGly+[ATP][γEC]βKATPKγEC+[Gly][γEC]αKGlyKγEC+[ATP][Gly][γEC]αβγKATPKGlyKγEC (Eq. 1) In this equation, KATP, KGly, and KγEC are the equilibrium dissociation constants for the binding of substrate to the free enzyme. The interaction factors between glycine and γ-glutamylcysteine, ATP and γ-glutamylcysteine, and ATP and glycine are represented by α, β, and γ, respectively. The interaction factors are factors by which the dissociation constant for a given substrate varies as other ligand binding sites are occupied. Examination of the residual plots and the standard errors of the fitted parameters also indicated that a random Terreactant system best described the data.Fits of the data to a random Ter-reactant kinetic model are drawn as lines in Fig. 2. The resulting kinetic model is shown in Fig. 3. Table II summarizes the fitted equation parameters and the calculated substrate dependencies. The fit of the data to a random mechanism was significantly better than the next best models, as follows: ordered B (ATP)/random AC (r2 = 0.971), ordered C (glycine)/random AB (r2 = 0.941), or ordered A (ATP)/random BC (r2 = 0.919). The fit (r2 = 0.896) to the previously proposed ordered mechanism (ATP/γ-glutamylcysteine/glycine) for E. coli GS (11Hara T. Kato H. Katsube Y. Oda J. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 11967-11974Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar) was worse than these partly ordered/random models.Fig. 3Model of the random Ter-reactant kinetic mechanism of AtGS.KATP, the KGly, and KγEC are the equilibrium dissociation constants for binding of substrate with the free enzyme. The interaction factors between glycine and γ-glutamylcysteine (γEC), ATP and γEC, and ATP and glycine are represented by α, β, and γ, respectively.

For example, the apparent Km values for ATP, γ-glutamylcysteine, and glycine (Table I) correspond to βγKATP, αγKGly, and αβKγEC, respectively (Table II). The model-derived dissociation constants are influenced by the interaction factors because the binding of some substrates will influence the binding of a second substrate. The interaction factors derived from fitting the data to a random Ter-reactant system (Table II) indicate that positive and negative interactions occur between different binding sites. Positive interactions occur between the ATP and γ-glutamylcysteine (β = 0.10) such that the binding of one substrate increases the affinity of AtGS for the other substrate 10-fold. Likewise, the prior binding of ATP increases the affinity for glycine (and vice versa) 3.5-fold (γ = 0.29). Negative interaction that reduces binding affinity 6.7-fold occurs between the glycine and γ-glutamylcysteine binding sites (α = 6.68). Thus, although the order of substrates binding to the enzyme is random, interactions between binding sites minimize unfavorable interactions and enhance the binding of certain substrates.Product Inhibition—Product inhibition studies were performed to determine the order of product release (31Cooper B.F. Rudolph F.B. Methods Enzymol. 1995; 249: 188-211Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar). The resulting Ki values and the best fits of the data to the inhibition equations are summarized in Table III. ADP was found to be a competitive inhibitor with respect to ATP. ADP was a non-competitive inhibitor versus both γ-glutamylcysteine and glycine. Glutathione was a non-competitive inhibitor of ATP, γ-glutamylcysteine, and glycine. Inorganic phosphate was also found to be a non-competitive inhibitor with respect to each substrate.Table IIIProduct inhibition patternsVaried substrateInhibitorFixed substrateInhibitionKimmATPADPγEC (2.5 mm), glycine (10 mm)C1.89 ± 0.35γECADPGlycine (10 mm), ATP (2.5 mm)NC2.67 ± 0.42GlycineADPγEC (2.5 mm), ATP (2.5 mm)NC0.77 ± 0.07ATPGlutathioneγEC (2.5 mm), glycine (10 mm)NC35.4 ± 1.9γECGlutathioneGlycine (10 mm), ATP (2.5 mm)NC16.6 ± 0.8GlycineGlutathioneγEC (2.5 mm), ATP (2.5 mm)NC22.7 ± 1.5ATPPiγEC (2.5 mm), glycine (10 mm)NC25.1 ± 2.6γECPiGlycine (10 mm), ATP (2.5 mm)NC69.1 ± 15.8GlycinePiγEC (2.5 mm), ATP (2.5 mm)NC47.3 ± 6.2 Open table in a new tab DISCUSSIONGS catalyzes the ATP-dependent formation of glutathione, a ubiquitous cellular protection compound. Compared with the bacterial GS, the kinetic properties of the eukaryotic enzymes are not well characterized. Here we described the heterologous expression of AtGS and the steady-state kinetic characterization of the purified recombinant enzyme. In addition, we employed a combination of initial velocity and product inhibition experiments to determine the order of substrate addition and product release for GS.AtGS shares a dimeric structure with the GS isolated from other eukaryotes (14Polekhina G.

Here we demonstrate that Vpr has the ability to regulate transcription of the cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor, p21WAF1 (p21), one of the key regulators of the cell cycle, in human astrocytic cells. The results from transcription assays demonstrated that Vpr augments promoter activity of p21 through the GC-rich region located between nucleotides -84 and -74 with respect to the +1 transcription start site. Activation of p21 by Vpr required cooperativity of Sp1, which binds to the DNA sequence spanning -84 to -74. Results from bandshift assay revealed an increased level of Sp1 DNA binding activity in the presence of Vpr. Furthermore, Vpr was able to associate with Sp1 via the zinc finger domain located in the C-terminal region of Sp1. Functional studies revealed that the cooperativity between Vpr and Sp1 requires the zinc finger domain at the C terminus and the glutamine-rich domain at the N terminus of Sp1. Expression of p53 further enhanced the level of Vpr-Sp1-mediated transcription activation of p21 through the sequence spanning -84 to -74 and increased the DNA binding activity of Sp1 in the presence of Vpr. Results from glutathione S-transferase pull-down assay showed the association of Vpr with p53 in extracts containing Sp1. Altogether, the outcome of our functional and binding studies suggested that the physical interaction of Vpr with Sp1 and p53 could modulate transcriptional activity of p21.

The association of these factors or their downstream responsive regulators with the specific DNA sequence spanning the p21 genome is important for their regulatory function upon p21. For example, p53, retinoic acid, vitamin D3, and interferon may utilize the distal-specific cis-acting DNA motifs that extend between positions -2280 and -120 to stimulate transcription of the p21 gene (14Liu M. Iavarone A. Freedman L.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 31723-31728Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (307) Google Scholar). The other regulators such as transforming growth factor β, progesterone, phorbol esters, and phosphatase inhibitors mediate their effects on p21 gene expression via the proximal region of the promoter, which spans -120 to +1 (15Kardassis D. Papakosta P. Pardali K. Moustakas A. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 29572-29581Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (178) Google Scholar). The proximal promoter contains consensus GC-rich motifs that may serve as binding sites for members of the Sp1 family of ubiquitous transcription factors (16Datto M.B. Yu Y. Wang X.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 28623-28628Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (400) Google Scholar). Sp1 belongs to a zinc finger family of transcription factors and was first identified based on its ability to interact with the GC-rich motif of SV40 regulatory sequences (17Cantor A.B. Orkin S.H.

This protein plays a critical role in many cellular events by regulating expression of several other genes, including early embryonic development and the maintenance of terminal cell differentiation (20Hasleton M.D. Ibbitt J.C. Hurst H.C. Biochem. J. 2003; 373: 925-932Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). The structure of Sp1 is composed of four domains, A–D, and a zinc finger region, which is involved in DNA-protein interaction (21Pascal E. Tjian R. Genes Dev. 1991; 5: 1646-1656Crossref PubMed Scopus (355) Google Scholar). Domains A and B are the two major glutamine-rich regions essential for transcriptional activation. Although the role of domain C is not fully understood, it has been shown that the region spanning domain C may be involved in synergistic activation with steroid regulatory element-binding proteins (22Athanikar J.N. Sanchez H.B. Osborne T.F. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 5193-5200Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). Domain D, by interacting with other activation domains, creates a configuration that maximizes their activity (23Courey A.J. Tjian R. Cell. 1988; 55: 887-898Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1079) Google Scholar). The DNA binding and transcriptional activities of Sp1 are regulated by the state of phosphorylation that follows changes in the cell cycle (24Dovat S. Ronni T. Russell D. Ferrini F. Cobb B.S.

Vpr is produced at the late phase of HIV-1 infection and plays a role in facilitating infection of nondividing cells such as macrophages (38Jowett J.B. Planelles V. Poon B. Shah N.P. Chen M.L.

Furthermore, Vpr can inhibit cell cycle progression at the G2 phase, at least in part via inactivation of the cyclin-dependent kinase cdc2 and hyperphosphorylation and the concomitant suppression of cdc2-cyclin B kinase activity (38Jowett J.B.

In this study we have focused on the transcriptional activity of Vpr, and we assessed the ability of Vpr to cooperate with Sp1 in regulating transcription of p21 through the GC-rich motif identified between -84 and -74. We demonstrate that the interaction of Vpr and Sp1 can potentiate p53 to enhance transcription of p21 via the GC-rich motif. Plasmids—The p21-luciferase reporter plasmid was a gift from J.

Drosophila melanogaster Schneider cell line, SL2, was kindly provided by Dr. J. Jaines (Thomas Jefferson University, Philadelphia). These cells were grown in Schneider medium (Sigma) supplemented with antibiotics and 12% heat-inactivated fetal calf serum (42Schneider I. J. Embryol. Exp.

Cell extracts were prepared 48 h after transfection, and CAT and luciferase assays were performed as described by Sawaya et al. (36Sawaya B.E. Khalili K. Mercer W.E. Denisova L. Amini S. J. Biol.

Overexpression and Purification of Recombinant Proteins—HIV-1 GST-Vpr, GST-p53, and GST-Sp1ΔZF fusion proteins were prokaryotically expressed and purified as described previously (44Smith D.B. Johnson K.S. Gene (Amst.). 1988; 67: 31-40Crossref PubMed Scopus (5047) Google Scholar). The integrity and purity of the GST fusion proteins were analyzed by SDS-PAGE followed by Coomassie Blue staining. Known amounts of bovine serum albumin were included as controls on the same gel. Radiolabeled Sp1 deletion mutants, p53, and Vpr proteins were synthesized with TnT-coupled wheat germ extract system according to the manufacturer's recommendations (Promega, Madison, WI). In Vitro Protein-Protein Interactions (GST Pull-down Assay)—For in vitro binding assays, 4 μl of 35S-labeled and translated Sp1 deletion mutants were incubated with 5.0 μg of GST or fusion proteins GST-Vpr coupled to glutathione-Sepharose beads in 300 μl of Lysis Buffer 150 (LB 150) for 2 h at 4 °C with continuous rocking (45Darbinian N. Sawaya B.E. Khalili K. Jaffe N. Wortman B. Giordano A. Amini S. J. Neuroimmunol. 2001; 121: 3-11Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). After incubation, the beads were separated by centrifugation and washed five times with LB 150 buffer. The same procedure was used with labeled and translated Vpr, and p53 when incubated with GST, GST-p53, and GST-Sp1ΔZF, or GST-Vpr, respectively. The bound proteins were eluted with Laemmli sample buffer, heated to 95 °C for 5 min, and separated by SDS-PAGE. Western Blot Assays—The U-87MG cells were transfected with 10 μg of a plasmid encoding wild type or mutant Vpr (Vpr and Vpr-LR), Sp1, and/or p53. Forty-eight hours post-transfection, cell extracts (100 μg of proteins/sample) derived from nontransfected or transfected cells were subjected to Western blot analysis using anti-p21, anti-Sp1 (Santa Cruz Biotechnology), anti-Vpr, or anti-p53 antibodies. Anti-p21 (Ab-5) (Oncogene, Cambridge, MA) recognizes the region encompassing amino acids 15–61 within the p21 protein. Western blot analysis was performed as described previously (36Sawaya B.E.

Gel Electrophoretic Mobility Shift Assay—Gel electrophoretic mobility shift assay was performed as described previously (43Amini S. Clavo A. Nadraga Y. Giordano A. Khalili K. Sawaya B.E. Oncogene. 2002; 21: 5797-5803Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). Oligonucleotides corresponding to the p21 promoter region were synthesized, annealed, labeled with [γ-32P]ATP, and incubated at 4 °C for 30 min with 10 μg of nuclear extracts or with 100 ng of translated Vpr protein. For supershift assays, antibodies directed against Sp1 or p53 (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) were mixed with nuclear proteins for 1 h at 4 °C prior to addition of the probe. The sequences of the oligonucleotides used in these experiments are as follows: a, p21wt (-89/-70), 5′-gCgggTCCCgCCTCCTTgAg-3′; b, p21wt (-70/-89), 5′-CTCAAggAggCgggACCCgC-3′; c, p21mut (-89/-70), 5′-gCgggTCCCgCCCT TgAg-3′; and d, p21mut (-70/-89) 5′-CTCAAgggCgg gACCCgC-3′. We demonstrated previously the ability of Vpr to induce p21 at transcriptional and translational levels and that Vpr activation of the HIV-1 LTR is p21-dependent. We have also demonstrated that Vpr affects p21 functions through a physical interaction. 2B. E. Sawaya, personal observation. To assess the effect of Vpr on transcription of p21, U-87MG cells were transfected with reporter plasmids containing the various regions of the p21 upstream regulatory sequence fused to the reporter gene along with a plasmid expressing Vpr. As shown in Fig. 1A, Vpr was able to enhance p21 promoter activity, and the minimum DNA sequence spanning between -93 and +1 of the p21 promoter is sufficient for Vpr to exert its activity. Close examination of the DNA sequence spanning -93 to +1 revealed the presence of several characteristic GC-rich motifs, putative binding sites for the Sp1 transcription factor, positioned upstream from the TATA box at position -44. Results from cluster mutants with 10 nucleotide changes across the p21 minimal promoter region suggest the importance of the DNA sequence (nucleotides -84 to -74) in Vpr activation of the p21 promoter (Fig. 1B, lane 2). As anticipated, alterations within the region spanning the TATA box (-54 to -44), where the transcription initiation complex is formed, drastically suppressed transcriptional activity of p21. Further mutations within the region -84 to -74 led us to conclude that the nucleotide sequence (nucleotides -79 to -76) is dispensable for Vpr activation of the p21 promoter (Fig. 1B). Previously, it has been shown that the region encompassing nucleotides -84 to -74 within the p21 promoter contains a GC-rich motif, putative binding sites for the Sp1 transcription factor (16Datto M.B. Yu Y. Wang X.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 28623-28628Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (400) Google Scholar). Therefore, it was necessary to elucidate the role of Vpr in the presence and absence of Sp1 and to examine whether Vpr binds the responsive DNA sequences directly in order to activate p21 promoter. To that end, we examined the importance of this sequence in transcriptional activation of p21 by Sp1 in astrocytic cells. As shown in Fig. 2A, the mutation within -84 to -74 severely affected the level of p21 activation by Sp1, suggesting a critical role for the distal GC-rich motif in transcription of the p21 gene (Fig. 2A, compare lanes 2 and 5). Co-expression of Sp1 and Vpr significantly elevated the level of transcription from the wild type but not the mutant p21 promoter, pointing to the potential cooperativity between Vpr and Sp1 and the importance of the sequence between -84 to -74 for this event (compare lanes 3 and 6). In an attempt to further demonstrate the functional interaction of Vpr with Sp1, we performed a similar set of transfection assays in an Sp1 null cell line, SL2. As shown in Fig. 2B, expression of Vpr had no effect on the basal transcription of the full-length (-2301 to +1) and the minimal (-93-S/+1) promoters of p21 (Fig. 2B, lanes 1 and 4). Most interestingly, in the presence of Sp1, Vpr gained the ability to augment the activity of the p21 promoter (Fig. 2B, lanes 3 and 6). The observed enhancement of p21 transcription was specific and required the intact distal GC-rich motif (-84 to -74), as the mutant -93-S mut2 showed no significant response to Vpr activation (Fig. 2B, lane 9). These experiments led us to conclude that activation of the p21 promoter by Vpr depends on the presence of Sp1. Later we examined the ability of Vpr to bind the DNA by bandshift assays using nuclear extracts prepared from Vpr, Sp1-, or Vpr plus Sp1-transfected cells, and a DNA probe spanning sequences between -89 to -70 or its mutant variant. The mutant oligonucleotide had two base substitutions, at positions -79 and -80, and two others deleted at positions -77 and -78 that prevents its association with Sp1 (16Datto M.B. Yu Y. Wang X.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 28623-28628Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (400) Google Scholar). As shown in Fig. 2C, the intensity of the band corresponding to the DNA-Sp1 complex was slightly enhanced in U-87MG cells transfected with a plasmid expressing Sp1 (Fig. 2C, compare complex C1 in lanes 2 and 3). The level of association of Sp1 with the DNA probe was further increased in cells expressing Sp1 and Vpr, suggesting that Vpr may facilitate binding of Sp1 to its responsive DNA motif (Fig. 2C, compare complex C1 in lanes 3 and 8). As expected, Vpr was unable to bind the DNA (Fig. 2C, lane 6). The -89/-70 sequence is the binding site for distinct transcription factors, including members of the Sp1 family (16Datto M.B. Yu Y. Wang X.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 28623-28628Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (400) Google Scholar). To examine whether proteins of the Sp1 family were present in complex C1, we performed supershift experiments by using anti-Sp1 antibody. The presence of the Sp1 protein in complex C1 was demonstrated, as addition of anti-Sp1 antibodies (Fig. 2C, lanes 5 and 10) but not a nonimmune serum (lanes 4 and 9), led to the up-shifting of the complex and the formation of the new complex C0. The Sp1 antibodies were unable to completely abolish the binding of the complex C1 to the DNA, suggesting that in addition to Sp1 other proteins are present in the C1 complex (Fig. 2C, complex C1, lanes 5 and 10). Competition using unlabeled wild type or mutant DNA probes verified the specificity of the complex (data not shown). When the mutant probe was used, the complex C1 was lost, and only the nonspecific complex remained (Fig. 2C, lanes 12–15). Furthermore, the mutant DNA probe failed to bind Sp1 in the absence and presence of Vpr (Fig. 2C, lanes 13–15). Results from the functional interaction of Vpr and Sp1 provided a rationale to investigate the physical association of these two proteins and to identify the regions within either Sp1 or Vpr, which are important for their cooperativity. A series of N- and C-terminal deletion mutants of Sp1 were created, and after production by a cell-free translation system, they were used in GST pull-down assay using GST or GST-Vpr. As shown in Fig. 3A, Sp1 contains three zinc finger domains, ZF1, ZF2, and ZF3, which are positioned between the C- and D-domains in the C terminus of the protein. Removal of ZF1 slightly decreased the level of Vpr interaction with Sp1 (Fig. 3B). Further deletion of the protein that removed ZF2 showed an increasingly negative effect on the association of Vpr and Sp1. Deletion of all three zinc fingers abrogated the interaction of Vpr with Sp1. Fig. 3B illustrates representative results from GST pull-down assay. These observations suggest that the zinc finger domains of Sp1 are critical for Vpr association. Next, we sought to identify the Sp1-binding domain within the Vpr. Previously, we as well as others demonstrated that Vpr-LR, a mutant that lacks the leucine-rich region, was unable to activate HIV-1 LTR (36Sawaya B.E. Khalili K. Mercer W.E. Denisova L. Amini S. J.

Chem. 1995; 270: 25564-25569Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (166) Google Scholar). Therefore, it was of interest to examine the ability of this mutant to bind to Sp1. To that end, U-87MG cells were transfected with 10 μg of Vpr-LR or Sp1 expression plasmids separately or in combination. As a positive control, cells were also transfected with Vpr wild type alone or combined with Sp1. As shown in Fig. 3C, and as expected, extracts isolated from Sp1-transfected cells showed an induction in Sp1 level when compared with the control cells (Fig. 3C, lanes 1 and 2). The increase in the Sp1 level was also observed in cells transfected with Sp1 and Vpr (Fig. 3C, lane 3) but not in cells transfected with Sp1 and Vpr-LR (Fig. 3C, lane 4). For the IP, 300 μg of cell proteins were incubated with anti-Vpr antibody (Fig. 3C, lanes 5 and 6), with nonimmune rabbit serum (lane 7), or with empty Sepharose beads (lane 8). Western blot analysis revealed that Sp1 was able to interact with the wild type (Fig. 3C, lane 5) but not with Vpr mutant (lane 6). The interaction between the two proteins was specific, because no interaction was observed with the rabbit serum or with the beads alone. These findings lead to the conclusion that the zinc finger domain within Sp1 and the leucine-rich region within Vpr are necessary for the physical interaction between these two proteins. To correlate the observed protein-protein interaction data with the functional cooperativity between Sp1 and Vpr on the p21 promoter, U-87MG cells were transfected with the p21 minimal promoter reporter construct (-93-S/+1) and plasmids expressing Vpr, Vpr-LR, wild type Sp1, and the various Sp1 mutants. Results from transfection assays revealed that complete or partial removal of the A-domain of Sp1 has no significant effect on the ability of Sp1 to stimulate transcription of p21 (Fig. 4A, compare lanes 4 and 6 with lane 2). Deletion of ZF1, ZF2, and ZF3 severely affected the ability of Sp1 to stimulate the"
https://openalex.org/W2004628029,"Detachment of adherent epithelial cells from the extracellular matrix induces apoptosis, known as anoikis. Integrin stimulation protects cells from anoikis, but the responsible mechanisms are not well known. Here, we demonstrated that a pro-apoptotic GTP-binding protein, DAP3 (death-associated protein 3), is critical for induction of anoikis. Down-regulation of DAP3 expression by antisense oligonucleotides inhibited anoikis. Conversely, overexpression of DAP3 augmented cell death and caspase activation induced by cell detachment. Furthermore, the association of DAP3 with FADD and the activation of caspase-8 were induced by cell detachment. We also showed that DAP3 is phosphorylated by kinase Akt (PKB), and active Akt can nullify apoptosis induction by DAP3. Mutation of a consensus Akt phosphorylation site in DAP3 renders it resistant to suppression by active Akt in cells. Integrin ligation stimulates Akt activation and phosphorylation of DAP3 in intact cells, as well as suppresses the ability of DAP3 overexpression to augment anoikis. Involvement of DAP3 in anoikis signaling demonstrates a novel role for this GTP-binding protein in apoptosis induction caused by cell detachment."

Inhibition of hsp90 function with 17-allylamino-17-demothoxygeldanamycin (17-AAG) reduces RET/PTC1 protein levels. Furthermore, 17-AAG increases radioiodide accumulation in thyroid cells, mediated in part through a protein kinase A-independent mechanism. We show that 17-AAG does not increase the total amount of NIS protein or cell surface NIS localization. Instead, 17-AAG increases radioiodide accumulation by decreasing iodide efflux.

Cell Stress Chaperones. 2002; 7: 91-96Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar), have been demonstrated to interact with hsp90. Structural studies of hsp90 have demonstrated the presence of a molecular clamp, whose open or closed state is regulated by the presence of ATP (9Prodromou C. Roe S.M. Piper P.W. Pearl L.H. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1997; 4: 477-482Crossref PubMed Scopus (206) Google Scholar). The co-chaperone p50cdc37 has been shown to interact with the molecular clamp, maintaining hsp90 in the open state and facilitating client protein loading (10Roe S.M. Ali M.M. Meyer P. Vaughan C.K. Panaretou B. Piper P.W. Prodromou C. Pearl L.H. Cell. 2004; 116: 87-98Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (274) Google Scholar). In contrast, hsp90 function can be inhibited by several members of the ansamycin family of antibiotics, including herbimycin A, geldanamycin, and 17-allylamino-17-demethoxygeldanamycin (17-AAG).Ansamycin antibiotics were thought to function as tyrosine kinase inhibitors (11Uehara Y. Murakami Y. Mizuno S. Kawai S. Virology. 1988; 164: 294-298Crossref PubMed Scopus (166) Google Scholar), however, it was subsequently demonstrated that their molecular target is hsp90 (12Stebbins C.E. Russo A.A. Schneider C.

Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 8324-8328Crossref PubMed Scopus (1317) Google Scholar). Geldanamycin and 17-AAG have been shown to reduce cellular proliferation and induce apoptosis, and interest has risen in their use as anti-neoplastic agents (14Goetz M.P. Toft D.O. Ames M.M. Erlichman C. Ann. Oncol. 2003; 14: 1169-1176Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (288) Google Scholar). The utility of geldanamycin, however, is limited by significant hepatotoxicity (15Supko J.G. Hickman R.L. Grever M.R. Malspeis L. Cancer Chemother. Pharmacol. 1995; 36: 305-315Crossref PubMed Scopus (477) Google Scholar). In contrast, 17-AAG is well tolerated in animal studies and has recently entered phase I clinical trials (14Goetz M.P. Toft D.O. Ames M.M. Erlichman C. Ann. Oncol. 2003; 14: 1169-1176Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (288) Google Scholar).Geldanamycin and 17-AAG represent novel chemotherapeutic agents for thyroid cancer. Park et al. (16Park J.W. Yeh M.W. Wong M.G. Lobo M. Hyun W.C. Duh Q.Y. Clark O.H. J. Clin. Endocrinol. Metab. 2003; 88: 3346-3353Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar) have demonstrated that geldanamycin decreased expression of c-Raf, inhibited thyroid cell proliferation, reduced Matrigel invasion, and induced apoptosis. Recently, the ability of 17-AAG to decrease thyroid cell proliferation has also been demonstrated, although no increase in apoptosis was observed (17Braga-Basaria M. Hardy E. Gottfried R. Burman K.D. Saji M. Ringel M.D. J. Clin. Endocrinol. Metab. 2004; 89: 2982-2988Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). Thyroid cancer is associated with mutations in several different kinase pathways, including ras and B-raf, and with activation of the AKT pathway (18Segev D.L. Umbricht C. Zeiger M.A. Surg. Oncol. 2003; 12: 69-90Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). In addition, several chromosomal rearrangements involving the RET gene have also been identified in papillary thyroid cancer and named RET/PTC (19Jhiang S.M. Oncogene. 2000; 19: 5590-5597Crossref PubMed Scopus (244) Google Scholar).RET/PTC chimeric oncoproteins have been identified in as many as 40% of papillary thyroid carcinomas in the general population (20Nikiforov Y.E. Endocr. Pathol. 2002; 13: 3-16Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and 60-70% of cases following the 1986 Chernobyl nuclear disaster (21Nikiforov Y.E. Rowland J.M. Bove K.E. Monforte-Munoz H. Fagin J.A. Cancer Res. 1997; 57: 1690-1694PubMed Google Scholar). All RET/PTC isoforms contain the C-terminal tyrosine kinase domain of the RET linked to the N-terminal portion of an activating gene. These N-terminal proteins are expressed in thyroid follicular cells and are capable of dimerization, resulting in constitutive activation of the RET kinase domain (19Jhiang S.M. Oncogene. 2000; 19: 5590-5597Crossref PubMed Scopus (244) Google Scholar). PTC1 is the most common rearrangement seen in the general population, whereas PTC3 was most highly prevalent in short-latency tumors after Chernobyl (22Smida J. Salassidis K. Hieber L. Zitzelsberger H. Kellerer A.M. Demidchik E.P. Negele T. Spelsberg F. Lengfelder E. Werner M. Bauchinger M. Int. J. Cancer. 1999; 80: 32-38Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). To develop novel molecular therapies for PTC-induced thyroid cancer, we have conducted a proteomic study to identify novel PTC1-associated factors.We have identified hsp90 and p50cdc37 as novel PTC1-associated proteins. Treatment with 17-AAG reduced PTC1 expression levels and increased radioiodide accumulation in thyroid cells, most likely through reduced iodide efflux. The effect of 17-AAG on radioiodide accumulation required preservation of the PKA signaling pathway, which maintained NIS expression at the cell surface. These results suggest that 17-AAG may be useful as a chemotherapeutic agent, not only to inhibit proliferation but also to increase the efficacy of radioiodide therapy in patients with thyroid cancer.MATERIALS AND METHODSCell Culture and Reagents—PC-Cl3 (23Fusco A.

Sugimura T. Nagao M. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1990; 168: 402-408Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar) human thyroid cancer cell lines were maintained in RPMI and DMEM, respectively, containing 10% fetal bovine serum and 1% penicillin-streptomycin RPMI and DMEM (Invitrogen). 293FT, HeLa, and COS-7 cells were grown in DMEM, supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum and 1% penicillin-streptomycin. 293FT cells are a fast-growing 293 cell line that stably expresses the large T antigen of SV40 (Invitrogen). Myristoylated PKI and 17-AAG were obtained from Calbiochem.Generation and Immunoprecipitation of FLAGPTC Constructs—To construct the FLAG-C1 vector, two complementary primers were designed based on the FLAG sequence, flanked by PinA1 and BspE1 sites (5′-ACC GGT CGC CAC CAT GGA CTA CAA GGA CGA CGA CGA CAA GT and 5′-TCC GGA CTT GTC GTC GTC GTC CTT GTA GTC CAT GGT GGC GA). EGFP-C1 vector (Clontech) was digested with PinA1/BspE1 to remove the green fluorescent protein sequence, and the annealed FLAG primers were ligated into the vector backbone.FLAGPTC1 was generated by subcloning PTC1 from pRC-CMV-PTC1 using EcoRV and DraI sites into FLAG-C1 vector, which had been cut with XhoI and filled in. FLAGPTC3 was created by subcloning PTC3 from pcDNA3-PTC3 using HindIII and EcoRV into FLAG-C1 cut with HindIII and SmaI. For FLAGPTC1 Y/F mutants, PTC1Y/F DNA fragments were released with EcoRI digestion from pBS-PTC1ΔE, pBS-PTC1ΔP, and pRC-CMV-PTC1ΔG, and then subcloned into FLAGPTC1 vector cut with EcoRI.Transfection of FLAGPTC constructs was performed using LipofectAMINE 2000 (Invitrogen). After 15 h, immunoprecipitation was performed with FLAG-M2-agarose (Sigma) using 500-1500 μg of whole cell extract (0.5% Nonidet P-40, 10 mm Tris (pH 7.5), and 100 mm NaCl). Equal amounts of extracts were incubated with 40 μl of FLAG-M2-agarose (Sigma) for 2 h at 4 °C. The pellets were washed twice and eluted using 150 ng/μl 3× FLAG peptide (Sigma) in TBS at 4 °C for 30 min. The eluted peptides were separated on polyacrylamide gels. Coomassie Blue staining was performed using GelCode Blue Stain Reagent (Pierce).MALDI-TOF Analysis of FLAGPTC-associated Proteins—SDS-gel sample bands were cut from Coomassie-stained gels and submitted the Proteomics Core Facility. The samples were transferred to the MassPrep station (PerkinElmer Life Sciences) for automated in-gel protein digestion, using WinPREP Multiprobe II software. Briefly, gel pieces were first de-stained with ammonium bicarbonate/acetonitrile and reduced with dithiothreitol. The samples were then alkylated with iodoacetamide, washed with ammonium bicarbonate, and dehydrated with acetonitrile. In-gel digestion was carried out with 6-ng/μl trypsin (Promega) in 50 mm ammonium bicarbonate for 5 h at 37 °C. The digested peptides were washed and concentrated with ZipTipC18 tips. The samples were eluted directly onto the Micromass MALDI-TOF target plate with 2 μl of matrix solution (2 mg/ml recrystallized α-cyano-4-hydroxycinnamic acid in 50% acetonitrile/0.2% trifluoroacetic acid) and air-dried.Mass spectra of the resulting peptides were recorded on the MALDI-TOF spectrometer in reflectron mode. Prior to data collection, calibration was performed using the following standards: angiotensin I (average molecular mass 1296.5 Da), renin (average molecular mass, 1759.0 Da), and adrenocorticotropic hormone 18-39 clip (average molecular mass, 2465.199 Da). Resulting peptides were matched with their corresponding proteins with the Protein Prospector (available at prospector.ucsf.edu/) by searching the non-redundant data base maintained at the NCBI (available at www3.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/). The following parameters are used for the search: mass tolerance, 0.1 Da; allowed incomplete cleavages, 1; acetylation of the N terminus, alkylation of cysteine, and oxidation of methionine were considered as possible modifications.Generation of PC-Cl3 Cell Lines with Constitutive and Doxycycline-inducible Expression of PTC1—To generate a constitutively expressing cell line, PTC1 was cloned into the pLNCX vector (Clontech) and transfected into Phoenix retroviral packaging cells. After 48 h, the media was harvested, centrifuged at 1000 rpm to pellet producer cells, and then filtered through a 0.22-μm filter. PC-Cl3 cells transduced with PTC1 retrovirus were selected with 400 μg/ml G418 (Invitrogen) and screened by Western blot analysis.To generate a PC-Cl3 cell line with inducible expression, PTC1 was cloned into the multiple cloning region of pTRE (Clontech). Phoenix cells were transfected with either pCMV-TetOn (Clontech) or pTRE-PTC1, and retrovirus was collected. PC-Cl3/pCMV-TetOn cells were selected with 400 μg/ml G418 and screened with transient transfection of TRE-luciferase. A highly inducible clone was subsequently infected with pTRE-PTC1 retrovirus to generate PC-Cl3/TetOn-PTC1 cell lines. Clones were selected with 200 μg/ml hygromycin and expanded in media containing 200 μg/ml G418 and 100 μg/ml hygromycin.Generation of HeLa Cell Lines with Doxycycline-inducible Expression of NIS—Human NIS was cloned into the multiple cloning site of pTRE (Clontech). Phoenix cells were transfected with pTRE-hNIS and retroviruses were harvested. HeLa TetOn cells (Clontech) were transduced with TRE-hNIS viral supernatant, and stable clones selected in media containing 250 mg/ml hygromycin (Clontech). The clones were expanded in media containing 100 mg/ml hygromycin.Radioactive Iodide Uptake and Efflux Studies—When cells were seeded, higher numbers of cells were included in wells treated with 17-AAG, due to its anti-proliferative effect. After treatment with 17-AAG, one well was counted for each treatment group, and the remaining wells were incubated with media containing 2.0 μCi of Na125I in 5 μm non-radioactive NaI for 30 min at 37 °C in 5% CO2. Cells were washed twice with ice-cold HBSS and lysed with cold 95% ethanol. The cell lysate was collected and counted for 125I activity.For efflux studies, the cells were incubated with media containing Na125I as described above. They were then washed twice and incubated in 1 ml of HBSS plus 5 μm non-radioactive NaI. After 2 min, the buffer was collected, and fresh HBSS plus 5 μm non-radioactive NaI was added. This was repeated every 2 min for a total of 10 min, after which the cells were lysed. The total uptake for each well was calculated as the sum of the efflux washes and the lysate.Preparation of Cell Lysate and Western Blot Analysis—Cells were washed twice in phosphate-buffered saline and lysed in 0.5% Nonidet P-40, 100 mm NaCl, and 10 mm Tris (pH 7.5) containing 1:500 Protease Inhibitor Mixture Set III (Calbiochem), 1 mm NaF, and 1 mm sodium orthovanadate. The extract was clarified by centrifugation at 14,000 rpm for 20 min at 4 °C. Protein concentration was determined by the Bradford method, and the lysate was separated on a 4-15% polyacrylamide gel and transferred to a nitrocellulose membrane. Membranes were blocked in 5% dry milk plus TBST (10 mm Tris (pH 8.0), 150 mm NaCl, 0.1% Tween 20), and Western blot to detect PTC1 was performed as previously described (27Xing S. Furminger T.L. Tong Q. Jhiang S.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 4909-4914Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). Antibodies against hsp90, p50cdc37, PLCγ were obtained from Santa Cruz, and FLAG M2 monoclonal antibody was purchased from Sigma.Crude, post-nuclear membrane fractions were prepared as described (28Lin X. Fischer A.H. Ryu K.Y. Cho J.Y. Sferra T.J. Kloos R.T. Mazzaferri E.L. Jhiang S.M. J. Clin. Endocrinol. Metab. 2004; 89: 2344-2350Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar), and 2 μg was resolved on a 4-15% polyacrylamide gel. Western blot analysis was performed using PA716 polyclonal rabbit α-rat NIS antibody diluted 1:2500 (a kind gift from Dr. Bernard Rousset, INSERM, Lyon, France). Antibody against the E subunit of V-ATPase (kindly provided by Dr. Beth Lee, The Ohio State University) was diluted 1:1000.Immunofluorescence—TetOn-PTC1 or parental PC-Cl3 cells (2 × 104) were seeded in 4-well chamber slides (Fisher Scientific). For wells treated with 17-AAG, 3 × 104 cells were seeded. After 24 h, 2 μg/ml doxycycline was added. 12 h later, 17-AAG was added to a final concentration of 3 μm for 24 h. The cells were washed with phosphate-buffered saline, fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde for 15 min, and blocked with 4% donkey serum for 1 h. The slides were incubated for 1 h with a PA716 α-NIS rabbit polyclonal antibody diluted 1:2500, followed by Cy3-conjugated donkey α-rabbit IgG antibody (Jackson ImmunoResearch) diluted 1:250 for 30 min. Cells were visualized using a fluorescent microscope equipped with a 63× oil immersion objective lens.Statistical Analysis—Statistical comparison of radioactive iodide uptake and efflux was performed using the paired t test test. A p value <0.05 was considered to be statistically significant.RESULTSCharacterization of FLAGPTC Constructs—To facilitate co-immunoprecipitation of PTC-associated proteins, we generated FLAGPTC1 and FLAGPTC3 constructs. The FLAG tag was placed at the N-terminal region of the PTC proteins to avoid interference with the C-terminal kinase domain. Following transfection into 293 cells, FLAGPTC1 and FLAGPTC3 expression was confirmed by Western blot (Fig. 1A), using α-FLAG M2 antibody or α-RET/PTC C1 antibody. In addition, co-immunoprecipitation using α-FLAG M2-agarose followed by Western blot demonstrated that PLCγ, a known PTC1-interacting protein (29Borrello M.G. Alberti L. Arighi E. Bongarzone I. Battistini C. Bardelli A. Pasini B. Piutti C. Rizzetti M.G. Mondellini P. Radice M.T. Pierotti M.A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 2151-2163Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), is associated with FLAGPTC1 (Fig. 1B).hsp90 and p50cdc37 Are Novel PTC1-associated Proteins—To identify novel PTC-associated factors, 293FT cells were transiently transfected with FLAG-C1 vector, FLAGPTC1, or FLAGPTC3 (Fig. 2A). Gel electrophoresis of α-FLAG M2 immunoprecipitates demonstrated four groups of proteins that were associated with both FLAGPTC1 and FLAGPTC3, but not FLAG-C1 vector. These proteins corresponded to molecular masses of 92-94, 74-76, 50, and 28 kDa. MALDI-TOF analysis of tryptic peptides from the excised bands identify hsp90, hsp70, and p50cdc37, with Molecular Weight Search (MOWSE) (30Pappin D.J. Hojrup P. Bleasby A.J. Curr. Biol. 1993; 3: 327-332Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1416) Google Scholar) scores of 2 × 1012, 8 × 105, and 1 × 105, respectively. However, analysis of the 28-kDa protein band did not yield strong MOWSE scores, the highest of which was 2 × 102 for cyclin G. Co-immunoprecipitation followed by Western blot verified the association of FLAGPTC1 with hsp90 and p50cdc37 in 293 cells (data not shown).Fig. 2hsp90 and p50cdc37 are novel PTC1-associated factors.A, Coomassie Blue staining shows four sets of PTC-associated proteins in 293FT cells: p90A-C, p70A-B, p50, and p30 (arrows). Asterisks indicate the location of FLAGPTC proteins. Co-immunoprecipitation was performed using 2.5 mg of WCE extract from transfected 293FT cells. B, hsp90 and p50cdc37 are associated with FLAGPTC1 in ARO human thyroid cancer cells. Mutations in tyrosines 294, 404, and 451 do not affect the association of FLAGPTC1 with hsp90 and p50cdc37. Co-immunoprecipitation was performed using 500 μg of whole cell extract (WCE), and Western blot analysis was performed using 20 μg WCE.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT)To determine whether PTC1 was associated with hsp90 and p50cdc37 in thyroid cells, we transiently transfected ARO human thyroid cancer cells with FLAGPTC1 or FLAG-C1 plasmids. Western blot analysis of α-FLAG M2 immunoprecipitates demonstrated that both hsp90 and p50cdc37 were associated with FLAGPTC1 but not with FLAG-C1 vector (Fig. 2B). In addition, we explored the requirement for specific tyrosines in the kinase domain of PTC1 to mediate interaction with hsp90 and p50cdc37. Mutations in tyrosines 294, 404, and 451 were studied, due to their well characterized roles in differentially mediating downstream signaling (19Jhiang S.M. Oncogene. 2000; 19: 5590-5597Crossref PubMed Scopus (244) Google Scholar). Single phenylalanine mutants of these tyrosines in PTC1 showed no decrease in their ability to interact with hsp90 and p50cdc37, compared with wild-type PTC1 (Fig. 2B).Inhibition of hsp90 Function with 17-AAG Reduces PTC1 Protein Levels—To determine the effect of inhibiting hsp90 function on PTC1, we employed PC-Cl3-TetOn/PTC1 cells (TetOn/PTC1), a rat immortalized thyroid cell line in which PTC1 expression is induced by doxycycline. Treatment with 17-AAG for 24 h resulted in a dose-dependent decrease in the expression level of PTC1 (Fig. 3A). The decrease in PTC1 expression was not the result of reduced levels of hsp90, as hsp90 levels were unchanged by 17-AAG.Fig. 3PTC1 protein levels are rapidly decreased following inhibition of hsp90 function with 17-AAG.A, treatment of TetOn/PTC1 cells with 17-AAG for 24 h decrease PTC1 protein levels in a dose-dependent manner. hsp90 is used as a loading control. B, treatment of TetOn/PTC1 cells with 17-AAG reduces PTC protein levels within 6 h. The schedule for induction of PTC1 expression and treatment with 17-AAG is shown in the diagrams. All Western blots were performed using 20 μg of whole cell extract. The data shown are representative of two experiments performed independently.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT)The temporal profile of PTC1 expression in response to 17-AAG was assessed by inducing PTC1 expression for 12 h, followed by the addition of 17-AAG to a final concentration of 3 μm for varying lengths of time. A rapid decrease in PTC1 expression levels occurred within 6 h of 17-AAG treatment (Fig. 3B, lane 2 versus 3). Due to continued induction of PTC1 by doxycycline, a slight increase in PTC1 levels occurred at 24 h, relative to the 6-h exposure (Fig. 3B, lane 3 versus 5). Taken together, inhibition of hsp90 function with 17-AAG results in a rapid decrease in PTC1 expression levels.17-AAG Increases Radioiodide Accumulation in Thyroid Cells—Expression of PTC1 has been previously reported to decrease NIS expression (31Trapasso F.

Oncogene. 1999; 18: 3659-3665Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). Indeed, we found that NIS protein levels (Fig. 4B, lane 1 versus 3) and RAIU (Fig. 4A) were reduced in TetOn/PTC1 compared with parental PC-Cl3 cells. Treatment with 17-AAG significantly increased radioiodide accumulation in TetOn/PTC1 cells (p < 0.05), and perchlorate inhibition (33Cho J.Y. Sagartz J.E. Capen C.C. Mazzaferri E.L. Jhiang S.M. Oncogene. 1999; 18: 3659-3665Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar) demonstrated that the radioiodide uptake following 17-AAG treatment was mediated by NIS. However, following 17-AAG treatment, NIS protein levels were decreased in PC-Cl3 cells and unchanged in TetOn/PTC1 cells, despite an increase in RAIU. Thus, the increase in RAIU by 17-AAG was not the result of increased amount of NIS protein. Interestingly, 17-AAG increased RAIU in TetOn/PTC1 cells to a level greater than that of parental PC-Cl3 cells.Fig. 417-AAG increases RAIU in TetOn/PTC1 and parental PC-Cl3 cells without increasing NIS protein levels.A, treatment with 17-AAG increased radioiodide accumulation in thyroid cells. PCCl3 cells were treated with 3 μm 17-AAG for 24 h. TetOn/PTC1 cells were treated with 3 μm 17-AAG as described in Fig. 3A. Perchlorate inhibition demonstrated that the radioiodine uptake was mediated by NIS. B, NIS protein levels were decreased by 17-AAG in parental PC-Cl3 cells but unchanged in TetOn/PTC1 cells. Western blot was performed using 2 μg of post-nuclear crude membrane fractions. The E subunit of V-ATPase was used as a loading control.

Withdrawal of TSH has been demonstrated to reduce cell surface NIS expression (34Riedel C. Levy O. Carrasco N. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 21458-21463Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (223) Google Scholar), and inhibition of PKA results in decreased NIS cell surface trafficking. 2K. Y. Ryu and S. M. Jhiang, unpublished results. Indeed, treatment of parental and TetOn/PTC1 cells with myristoylated PKI, a PKA inhibitor, resulted in reduced RAIU (Fig. 5A) and decreased expression of cell surface NIS (Fig. 5B). Following 17-AAG treatment, however, NIS surface expression was unchanged in both TetOn/PTC1 and parental PC-Cl3 cells, compared with untreated cells. Treatment with PKI prior to the addition of 17-AAG reduced both RAIU (p < 0.05) and NIS cell surface expression. Regardless, RAIU was higher in cells treated with both PKI and 17-AAG (Fig. 5A) compared with those treated with PKI alone (p < 0.05), suggesting that 17-AAG increases RAIU in part through a PKA-independent mechanism.Fig. 517-AAG increased RAIU in part through a PKA-independent mechanism.A, whereas inhibition of PKA function by PKI reduced radioiodide accumulation in the presence or absence of 17-AAG, RAIU is higher in cells treated with both PKI and 17-AAG compared with PKI alone.

https://openalex.org/W2105783369,"An antibiotic, d-cycloserine (DCS), inhibits the catalytic activities of alanine racemase (ALR) and d-alanyl-d-alanine ligase (DDL), which are necessary for the biosynthesis of the bacterial cell wall. In this study, we cloned both genes encoding ALR and DDL, designated alrS and ddlS, respectively, from DCS-producing Streptomyces lavendulae ATCC25233. Each gene product was purified to homogeneity and characterized. Escherichia coli, transformed with a pET vector carrying alrS or ddlS, displays higher resistance to DCS than the same host carrying the E. coli ALR- or DDL-encoded gene inserted into the pET vector. Although the S. lavendulae DDL was competitively inhibited by DCS, the Ki value (920 μm) was obviously higher (40∼100-fold) than those for E. coli DdlA (9 μm) or DdlB (27 μm). The high Ki value of the S. lavendulae DDL suggests that the enzyme may be a self-resistance determinant in the DCS-producing microorganism. Kinetic studies for the S. lavendulae ALR suggest that the time-dependent inactivation rate of the enzyme by DCS is absolutely slower than that of the E. coli ALR. We conclude that ALR from DCS-producing S. lavendulae is also one of the self-resistance determinants. An antibiotic, d-cycloserine (DCS), inhibits the catalytic activities of alanine racemase (ALR) and d-alanyl-d-alanine ligase (DDL), which are necessary for the biosynthesis of the bacterial cell wall. In this study, we cloned both genes encoding ALR and DDL, designated alrS and ddlS, respectively, from DCS-producing Streptomyces lavendulae ATCC25233. Each gene product was purified to homogeneity and characterized. Escherichia coli, transformed with a pET vector carrying alrS or ddlS, displays higher resistance to DCS than the same host carrying the E. coli ALR- or DDL-encoded gene inserted into the pET vector. Although the S. lavendulae DDL was competitively inhibited by DCS, the Ki value (920 μm) was obviously higher (40∼100-fold) than those for E. coli DdlA (9 μm) or DdlB (27 μm). The high Ki value of the S. lavendulae DDL suggests that the enzyme may be a self-resistance determinant in the DCS-producing microorganism. Kinetic studies for the S. lavendulae ALR suggest that the time-dependent inactivation rate of the enzyme by DCS is absolutely slower than that of the E. coli ALR. We conclude that ALR from DCS-producing S. lavendulae is also one of the self-resistance determinants. Since the discovery of streptomycin, tuberculosis, a disease caused by infection of Mycobacterium tuberculosis, has decreased annually; however, currently, it is once again on the rise. The increase in morbidity is likely because of the decline in immunity caused by changes in the environment and diet (1Sammon A.M. Postgrad. Med. J. 1999; 75: 129-132Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). In addition, the advent of multidrug-resistant M. tuberculosis is also a cause of the return of tuberculosis (2Pablos-Mendez A. Raviglione M.C. Laszlo A. Binkin N. Rieder H.L. Bustreo F. Cohn D.L. Lambregts-van Weezenbeek C.S. Kim S.J. Chaulet P. Nunn P. N. Engl. J. Med. 1998; 338: 1641-1649Crossref PubMed Scopus (837) Google Scholar). d-Cycloserine (d-4-amino-3-isoxazolidone (DCS) 1The abbreviations used are: DCS, d-cycloserine; aa, amino acid(s); ALR, alanine racemase; alrS, a gene encoding ALR from DCS-producing S. lavendulae; DDL, d-alanyl-d-alanine ligase; ddlS, a gene encoding DDL from DCS-producing S. lavendulae; ddlA, a gene encoding DDL from E. coli or S. typhymurium; ddlB, a gene encoding DDL from E. coli; K12alr, a gene encoding ALR from E. coli K-12 W3110; LCS, l-cycloserine; MES, 2-(N-morpholino)ethanesulfonic acid; ORF, open reading frame; PLP, pyridoxal 5′-phosphate.), which is a cyclic structural analogue of d-alanine (d-Ala) and is produced by Streptomyces garyphalus and Streptomyces lavendulae, is a clinical medicine for the treatment of tuberculosis. The antibiotic is an effective anti-mycobacterial agent, but it is rarely prescribed and is used only in combined therapies because of its serious side effects (3Heifets L.B. Iseman M.D. Am. Rev. Respir. Dis. 1991; 144: 1-2Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). The side effects are caused by the binding of DCS to N-methyl-d-aspartate receptors as an agonist. However, application of these adverse effects to treatments for neural diseases (4Johannesen T.S. Myhrer T. Eur. J. Pharmacol. 2002; 437: 73-77Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar) such as Alzheimer's (5Andersen J.M. Lindberg V. Myhrer T. Behav. Brain Res. 2002; 129: 211-216Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar) and Parkinsonism (6Schneider J.S. Tinker J.P. Van Velson M. Giardiniere M. Brain Res. 2000; 860: 190-194Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar) have been dedicatedly researched. The peptidoglycan layer, which is contained in a bacterial cell wall, is the main component that enables bacteria to be resistant to osmotic pressure. The formation of UDP-N-acetyl muramyl pentapeptide, which is a precursor of peptidoglycan, is followed by a cross-link reaction of the precursors. In the cross-linking process, d-Ala plays an important role as a bridge molecule (7Walsh C.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 2393-2396Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Because d-amino acids, including d-Ala, are not primarily found in natural resources, bacteria generate d-Ala from l-Ala by the catalysis of Ala racemase (ALR). This enzyme needs a pyridoxal 5′-phosphate (PLP) as a cofactor and catalyzes the racemization of both Ala enantiomers. Escherichia coli and Salmonella typhimurium possess two kinds of closely related ALR-encoded genes (alr and dadX in E. coli, and dal and dadB in S. typhimurium) (8Wasserman S.A. Daub E. Grisafi P. Botstein D. Walsh C.T. Biochemistry. 1984; 23: 5182-5187Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar, 9Esaki N. Walsh C.T. Biochemistry. 1986; 25: 3261-3267Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar, 10Lilley P.E. Stamford N.P. Vasudevan S.G. Dixon N.E. Gene. 1993; 129: 9-16Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). For example, the racemase encoded by dal of S. typhimurium is necessary for peptidoglycan synthesis and displays a 40% identity to a catabolic racemase encoded by dadB (11Galakatos N.G. Daub E. Botstein D. Walsh C.T. Biochemistry. 1986; 25: 3255-3260Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). d-Ala, generated by ALR, is a substrate to form d-alanyl-d-alanine (d-Ala-d-Ala) (12Neuhaus F.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1962; 237: 778-786Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The dipeptide is formed by the action of an ATP-dependent enzyme, d-Ala-d-Ala ligase (DDL) and is incorporated into the peptidoglycan precursor by the catalytic activity of the d-Ala-d-Ala-adding enzyme (7Walsh C.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 2393-2396Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). E. coli produces two kinds of DDL, designated DdlA and DdlB, which are encoded by ddlA and ddlB, respectively. S. typhimurium expresses DDL, which has high similarity to the E. coli DdlA (13Zawadzke L.E. Bugg T.D.H. Walsh C.T. Biochemistry. 1991; 30: 1673-1682Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar). DCS interferes with the activities of both ALR and DDL, which are necessary for the synthesis of peptidoglycan contained in the cell wall of bacteria. Because these enzymes are unique to bacteria, they may become potential targets for the screening of selective anti-bacterial agents (14Neuhaus F.C. Hammes W.P. Pharmacol. Ther. 1981; 14: 265-319Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). ALR and DDL have been considered competitively inhibited because DCS is structurally similar to d-Ala (13Zawadzke L.E. Bugg T.D.H. Walsh C.T. Biochemistry. 1991; 30: 1673-1682Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar, 15Lambert M.P. Neuhaus F.C. J. Bacteriol. 1972; 110: 978-987Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). However, it was recently reported that DCS inhibits the catalytic activity of ALR in a time-dependent inactivation manner (16Fenn T.D. Stamper G.F. Morollo A.A. Ringe D. Biochemistry. 2003; 42: 5775-5783Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). In addition, the antibiotic and its enantiomer, l-cycloserine (LCS), inhibit several kinds of PLP-dependent enzymes in the same manner (16Fenn T.D. Stamper G.F. Morollo A.A. Ringe D. Biochemistry. 2003; 42: 5775-5783Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar, 17Peisach D. Chipman D.M. van Ophem P.W. Manning J.M. Ringe D. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1998; 120: 2268-2274Crossref Scopus (41) Google Scholar, 18Wang E. Walsh C. Biochemistry. 1978; 17: 1313-1321Crossref PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar). Antibiotic-producing microorganisms must be protected from the lethal effect of their own products. We recently cloned a 3.5-kb DNA fragment carrying a gene that confers resistance to DCS from DCS-producing S. garyphalus by a “shotgun” cloning technique (19Matsuo H. Kumagai T. Mori K. Sugiyama M. J. Antibiot. 2003; 56: 762-767Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar). The hydropathy plot analysis of a protein deduced from the nucleotide sequence of the gene encoding DCS resistance revealed that the protein may carry membrane-integral domains spanning the membrane 10 times, suggesting that the DCS resistance gene product may be a factor associated with DCS transport. Interestingly, an incomplete gene was found to be located upstream of the transmembrane protein gene from S. garyphalus. The incomplete gene consists of 246 bp, and the putative protein has a 52.6% identity with a d-Ala-d-Ala ligase from Pseudomonas aeruginosa (20Stober C.K. Pham X.Q. Erwin A.L. Mizoguchi S.D. Warrener P. Hickey M.J. Brinkman F.S. Hufnagle W.O. Kowalik D.J. Lagrou M. Garber R.L. Goltry L. Tolentino E. Westbrock-Wadman S. Yuan Y. Brody L.L. Coulter S.N. Folger K.R. Kas A. Larbig K. Lim R. Smith K. Spencer D. Wong G.K. Wu Z. Paulsen I.T. Reizer J. Saier M.H. Hancock R.E. Lory S. Olson M.V. Nature. 2000; 406: 959-964Crossref PubMed Scopus (3465) Google Scholar). On the other hand, although the cloned fragment has a few open reading frames (ORFs), it has no gene, which makes it similar to a gene encoding ALR. Because DDL and ALR are target enzymes of DCS, it is of great interest to know whether these enzymes from the DCS-producing microorganism show resistance to DCS. In the present study, an effort was made to clone ALR- and DDL-encoding genes from DCS-producing S. lavendulae ATCC25233. Both the S. lavendulae ALR and DDL, which were overproduced in an E. coli host vector system, were purified and characterized biochemically and kinetically. The present study suggests that the Streptomyces ALR and DDL function as self-resistance determinants. Bacterial Strains and Plasmids—E. coli strains TG1, JM109, and DH5α and plasmids pUC18 and pUC19 were used for the cloning experiments. E. coli XL1-Blue MRA (P2) was used for the construction of phage libraries. E. coli BL21(DE3)-pLysS and plasmid pET-21a(+) (Novagen) were used for protein expression. E. coli was grown in LB medium (21Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. 2nd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar) at 37 or 28 °C. If necessary, ampicillin (100 μg/ml) and/or chloramphenicol (34 μg/ml) were added to the LB medium. For the cultivation of E. coli XL1-Blue MRA (P2), 0.2% maltose and 10 mm MgSO4 were added to the LB medium. Streptomyces coelicolor A3 (2Pablos-Mendez A. Raviglione M.C. Laszlo A. Binkin N. Rieder H.L. Bustreo F. Cohn D.L. Lambregts-van Weezenbeek C.S. Kim S.J. Chaulet P. Nunn P. N. Engl. J. Med. 1998; 338: 1641-1649Crossref PubMed Scopus (837) Google Scholar) (strain M145), used as the typical strain of the International Streptomyces Genome Project (22Bentley S.D. Chater K.F.

Nature. 2002; 417: 141-147Crossref PubMed Scopus (2639) Google Scholar), and DCS-producing S. lavendulae ATCC25233 were grown at 28 °C in a GMP medium (23Ikeda K. Masujima T. Sugiyama M. J. Biochem. 1996; 120: 1141-1145Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar) or a YEME medium (24Hopwood D.A. Bidd M.J. Chater K.F. Kieser T. Bruton C.J. Kieser H.M. Lydiate D.J. Smith C.P. Ward J.M. Schrempf H. Genetic Manipulation of Streptomyces: A Laboratory Manual. John Innes Foundation, Norwich, UK1985Google Scholar). DNA Manipulations—Plasmid DNA from E. coli was isolated by the standard method described previously (21Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. 2nd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar). The chromosomal DNA from S. coelicolor A3 (2Pablos-Mendez A. Raviglione M.C. Laszlo A. Binkin N. Rieder H.L. Bustreo F. Cohn D.L. Lambregts-van Weezenbeek C.S. Kim S.J. Chaulet P. Nunn P. N. Engl. J. Med. 1998; 338: 1641-1649Crossref PubMed Scopus (837) Google Scholar) and S. lavendulae was isolated from 100 ml of a culture grown at 28 °C for 72 h according to a method described earlier (24Hopwood D.A. Bidd M.J. Chater K.F. Kieser T. Bruton C.J. Kieser H.M. Lydiate D.J. Smith C.P. Ward J.M. Schrempf H. Genetic Manipulation of Streptomyces: A Laboratory Manual. John Innes Foundation, Norwich, UK1985Google Scholar). Phage DNA from plaque was isolated by the standard method described elsewhere (21Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. 2nd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar). Analysis of Genes Encoding the DCS Resistance Determinant from S. lavendulae—The chromosomal DNA (500 μg) from S. lavendulae was partially digested with BamHI, purified by the phenol/chloroform extraction method, and precipitated by ethanol. The DNA fragments, cleaved within 10–20 kb, were separated by sucrose gradient (10–40%) centrifugation and precipitated by ethanol (21Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. 2nd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar). After the 5′-dephosphorylation of DNA with bacterial alkaline phosphatase, the resulting DNA fragments were ligated to a BamHI-digested Lambda DASH II vector (Stratagene). In vitro packaging was performed using a Gigapack III Gold Packaging Extract (Stratagene) according to the supplier's instructions. The resulting phages were infected to E. coli XL1-Blue MRA (P2) and plated onto an NZYM medium (21Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. 2nd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar) containing 1.2% agarose to generate plaques. The plaques generated on the NZYM agarose plate were transferred to a nylon membrane (Hybond-N+, Amersham Biosciences), and the phage DNA was fixed to the membrane by the alkaline treatment (21Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. 2nd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar). Hybridization was performed at 65 °C by using a 1.2-kb DNA fragment from pCSPC9 (which contains the DCS resistance gene of S. garyphalus (19Matsuo H. Kumagai T. Mori K. Sugiyama M. J. Antibiot. 2003; 56: 762-767Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar)) as a probe DNA. The probe labeling, hybridization, and detection were performed with an AlkPhos direct labeling and detection kit (Amersham Biosciences) according to the supplier's instructions. One positive clone was obtained by plaque hybridization. The phage DNA, isolated from the positive plaque, had a 14-kb DNA insert from S. lavendulae. The phage DNA containing a 14-kb DNA from S. lavendulae was digested with BamHI. The resulting DNA fragments (about 1.2, 2.0, 2.9, and 8.0 kb) were subcloned into pUC18 or pUC19. Using the resulting chimeric plasmids, the DNA sequence was determined with the BigDye terminator cycle sequencing ready reaction kit (Applied Biosystems) and ABI PRIZM 310 genetic analyzer (Applied Biosystems). Of the 14-kb DNA fragment, in the present study, we determined the nucleotide sequence of a 2820-bp DNA fragment including the S. lavendulae DDL gene. Genetic analysis was performed by using GENETYX-Mac software (Software Development, Tokyo, Japan) and the Frame Analysis program (25Bibb M.J. Findlay P.R. Johnson M.W. Gene. 1984; 30: 157-166Crossref PubMed Scopus (648) Google Scholar). The homology search was done with the FASTA program. The DNA sequence determined in this study has been submitted to the DNA Data Bank of Japan (DDBJ accession number AB176675). Cloning and Analysis of an ALR Gene from S. lavendulae—The chromosomal DNA from S. lavendulae ATCC25233, which was digested with BamHI, was fractionated on 0.8% agarose gel electrophoresis and transferred to a Hybond-N+ membrane using the standard protocol (21Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. 2nd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar). Southern hybridization analysis was done using a putative ALR gene (1176-bp) from S. coelicolor (22Bentley S.D. Chater K.F. Cerdeno-Tattaga A.M. Challis G.L. Thomson N.R. James K.D. Harris D.E. Quail M.A. Kieser H. Harper D. Bateman A. Brown S. Chandra G. Chen C.W. Collins M. Cronin A. Fraser A. Goble A. Hidalgo J. Horncby T. Howarth S. Huang C.H. Kieser T. Larke L. Murphy L. Oliver K. O'Neil S. Rabbinowitsch E. Rajandream M.A. Rutherford K. Rutter S. Seeger K. Saunders D. Sharp S. Squares R. Squares S. Taylor K. Warren T. Wietzorrek A. Woodward J. Barrell B.G. Parkhill J. Hopwood D.A. Nature. 2002; 417: 141-147Crossref PubMed Scopus (2639) Google Scholar) as a probe. To obtain the probe DNA, PCR amplification was done using the S. coelicolor genomic DNA as a template together with a sense primer (5′-ATGAGCGAGACAACTGCTCGGCGGGACGCG-3′) and an antisense primer (5′-TCATTCGTTGACGTAGACGCGCGGGACCCGG-3′). PCR was done under the following conditions: an initial 5 min at 96 °C and 3 min at 70 °C; then, 24 cycles of 1 min at 96 °C and 3 min at 70 °C; and, finally, a 3-min extension period at 72 °C. Probe labeling, hybridization, and detection were performed using an AlkPhos direct labeling and detection kit according to the manufacturer's instructions. The probe DNA was hybridized to BamHI-digested genomic DNA that had a size of 3.0 kb. Therefore, BamHI digests of 2.5–3.5 kb were extracted from the agarose gel, purified, ligated to BamHI-digested pUC19, and then introduced into E. coli TG1. The resulting genomic libraries were screened using the colony hybridization technique (21Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. 2nd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar). From ∼8000 clones, 52 candidates carrying the putative ALR gene were obtained using the putative alr from S. coelicolor as a probe DNA. One of the chimeric plasmids, isolated from these candidate colonies, was hybridized to the probe. Results from the International Streptomyces Genome Project confirmed that a protein deduced from the nucleotide sequence of the S. lavendulae gene, which was inserted into the candidate plasmid, displayed a high similarity with the S. coelicolor putative ALR. DNA sequencing was performed with the ABI PRIZM 310 genetic analyzer using the BigDye terminator cycle sequencing ready reaction kit according to the manufacturer's protocols. Using a combination of subcloning and chromosome-walking techniques, the entire nucleotide sequence of the cloned DNA fragment containing the S. lavendulae ALR gene, designated alrS, was determined and analyzed for the existence of ORF using GENETYX-Mac software. The ORFs were predicted using a frame analysis program (25Bibb M.J. Findlay P.R. Johnson M.W. Gene. 1984; 30: 157-166Crossref PubMed Scopus (648) Google Scholar). The similarity among proteins was searched using the FASTA program on the website. The sequence data obtained in this study has been submitted to the DDBJ (accession number AB176676). Overexpression and Purification of S. lavendulae DDL—A gene encoding DDL from S. lavendulae was amplified by PCR using a sense primer, 5′-CACCATATGCGAATCGTGATCTTGTGTGGTGGAGAAGC-3′ (NdeI site underlined), and an antisense primer, 5′-CACCTCGAGTCAGCGGGTGGCGAGGGACAC-3′ (XhoI site underlined). PCR was done under the following conditions: 1 cycle of 5 min at 96 °C, 1 min at 55 °C, and 2 min at 72 °C followed by 29 cycles of 1 min at 96 °C, 1 min at 55 °C, and 2 min at 72 °C. The amplified DNA was digested with NdeI and XhoI and subcloned into the same sites of pET-21a(+) to generate pET-ddlS. E. coli BL21(DE3)-pLysS harboring pET-ddlS was grown at 28 °C in 6 liters of LB medium to an A600 nm = 0.5, whereupon isopropyl-β-d-thiogalactopyranoside was added to the culture at the final concentration of 1 mm to induce the expression of ddlS. The E. coli cells were grown for 8 h at 28 °C. The purification of the S. lavendulae DDL was carried out at 4 °C: the E. coli cells were suspended in Buffer I (50 mm sodium phosphate (pH 7.5), 10 mm MgCl2, 2 mm dithiothreitol, and 1 mm EDTA·Na2) and disrupted by sonication. The cell debris was removed by centrifugation at 17,000 × g for 30 min. Solid ammonium sulfate was gradually added to the supernatant to 20% saturation and centrifuged to obtain the supernatant fluid. Solid ammonium sulfate was added to the supernatant fluid to 50% saturation, and the resulting precipitate was collected by centrifugation. The precipitate was dissolved in a small volume of Buffer I and dialyzed against the same buffer. After the dialysate was applied on a DEAE-Sepharose column (2.5 × 10 cm, Amersham Biosciences) previously equilibrated with Buffer I, the column was washed with the same buffer. Elution was done with a 0–500 mm KCl linear gradient concentration in Buffer I. The fractions containing the S. lavendulae DDL were pooled and dialyzed against Buffer II (20 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 2.5 m KCl, 1 mm ATP, 10 mm MgCl2, and 1 mm 2-mercaptoethanol) and then subjected to an Octyl-Sepharose column (1.5 × 15 cm, Amersham Biosciences) previously equilibrated with Buffer II. Since no S. lavendulae DDL was bound to the column, the solution that passed through the column was collected. Finally, the solution carrying the DDL activity was dialyzed against Buffer III (50 mm sodium phosphate (pH 7.5), 10 mm MgCl2, 2 mm dithiothreitol, 1 mm EDTA·Na2, and 0.2 mm ATP) and applied on a DEAE-Sepharose column (1 × 15 cm) equilibrated with Buffer III. The S. lavendulae DDL did not bind to the column, possibly because of the presence of ATP. Therefore, the solution that passed through the column was collected. Through these steps, the S. lavendulae DDL was purified to homogeneity. Overexpression and Purification of S. lavendulae ALR—An ALR gene of S. lavendulae was amplified by PCR using the sense primer, 5′-CACCATATGAACGAGACACCGACGCGCGTG-3′ (the underline indicates the NdeI cleavage site), and the antisense primer, 5′-TATCTCGAGGCCGCCGAGGTAGACCCGGG-3′ (the underline indicates the XhoI cleavage site). The amplified DNA was digested with NdeI and XhoI and then subcloned into the same sites of pET-21a(+) to yield pET-alrS. The pET-alrS plasmid expresses ALR having His6 tag at the C terminus. E. coli BL21(DE3)-pLysS harboring pET-alrS was grown in 3 liters of LB medium at 28 °C. At the exponential phase of growth (A600 nm = 0.6), isopropyl-β-d-thiogalactopyranoside was added to the culture at a concentration of 0.1 mm to express the ALR gene. After an additional incubation for 4.5 h, the cells were harvested by centrifugation and washed with a binding buffer (20 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.9), 500 mm NaCl, and 5 mm imidazole. The washed cells (20 g wet weight) were suspended into 200 ml of the same buffer and disrupted by sonication at 4 °C for 60 min. The cell debris was removed by centrifugation at 24,000 × g twice for 20 min. The resulting cell-free extract was brought to 65% saturation with solid ammonium sulfate. The resulting precipitate was collected by centrifugation at 24,000 × g for 20 min, dissolved in a binding buffer, and dialyzed against the same buffer. The dialysate was applied to a Ni(II)-chelated His-bind resin (Novagen) column (1.0 × 30 cm) according to the manufacturer's protocol. The column was washed with a wash buffer (20 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.9), 500 mm NaCl, and 60 mm imidazole) and eluted with a linear gradient of 60–350 mm imidazole. The fractions having ALR activity were pooled and concentrated by ultrafiltration (Amicon Ultra, Millipore). The concentrate was loaded onto a Sephadex G-100 super fine (Amersham Biosciences) column (1.5 × 120 cm) equilibrated with a 200 mm Tris-HCl buffer (pH 8.5) supplemented with 50 mm NaCl and eluted with the same buffer. The purified enzyme fractions were collected, concentrated by ultrafiltration, and stored at 4 °C until use. Overexpression and Purification of E. coli ALR—A gene encoding ALR from E. coli K12 W3110 was amplified by PCR using the primers 5′-CACCATATGCAAGCGGCAACTGTTGTGATT-3′ (the underline indicates the NdeI cleavage site) and 5′-TATCTCGAGATCCACGTATTTCATCGCGAC-3′ (the underline indicates the XhoI cleavage site) according to the genome information (26Blattner F.R. Plunkett G. Bloch C.A. Perna N.T. Burland V. Riley M. Collado-Vides J. Glanser J.D. Rode C.K. Mayhew G.F. Gregor J. Davis N.W. Kirkpatrick H.A. Goeden M.A. Rose D.J. Mau B. Shao Y. Science. 1997; 277: 1453-1474Crossref PubMed Scopus (6081) Google Scholar). The amplified DNA was inserted into pET-21a(+) to generate pET-K12alr. The cell-free extract of E. coli BL21(DE3)-pLysS harboring pET-K12alr was applied to a Ni(II)-chelated His-bind resin column (1.0 × 30 cm) and washed with the binding buffer. Elution was done with the same buffer containing 500 mm imidazole. The enzyme fraction was concentrated by 65% ammonium sulfate precipitation, and the resulting precipitate was dissolved in a 50 mm ammonium phosphate buffer (pH 8.2) containing 50 mm NaCl followed by dialysis against the same buffer. The dialyzed solution was subjected to a DEAE-Sepharose column (1.0 × 30 cm) equilibrated with the same buffer. The fraction that passed through the column containing ALR from E. coli K12 was concentrated by ultrafiltration. Enzyme Assay of DDL—The DDL activity was monitored by the continuous ADP release-coupled assay method as described previously (27Daub E. Zawadzke L.E. Botstein D. Walsh C.T.

The DDL activity at different pH values was compared with buffers prepared as follows. A solution containing 100 mm Tris, 100 mm glycine, and 100 mm MES was adjusted to pH 6.0 and 10.5. By mixing the two solutions, buffers with pH values of 6.0, 7.0, 8.0, 9.0, 9.5, and 10.0 were prepared. All reactions were carried out at 37 °C. The protein concentrations were determined using a Bio-Rad Protein Assay (Bio-Rad), which is based on the method of Bradford (28Bradford M.M. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 34: 248-254Crossref Scopus (218585) Google Scholar). Enzyme Kinetic Study of DDL—Kinetic assays for the purified S. lavendulae DDL were carried out by the continuous ADP release-coupled assay method (27Daub E. Zawadzke L.E. Botstein D. Walsh C.T.

By application of the steady-state approximation to the proposed reaction sequence, which is shown as Equation 1, a rate equation (Equation 2) can be obtained, which gives parabolic Lineweaver-Burk plots (Equation 3). The Vmax value can be obtained from the y intercept of Equation 3. Subsequently, a plot of [S](1/V – 1/Vmax) against 1/[S] gives a straight line (Equation 4), in which the y intercept (K2/Vmax) and slope (K1K2/Vmax) provide the two Km values.E+S⇄K1ES+S⇄K2ESS→kcatE+P(Eq. 1) V=Vmax[S]2K1K2+K2[S]+[S]2(Eq. 2) 1V=1Vmax+K2Vmax1[S]+K1K2Vmax1[S]2(Eq. 3) [S][1V−1Vmax]=K2Vmax+K1K2Vmax1[S](Eq. 4) Because the K1 value in the above equations is very small (13Zawadzke L.E. Bugg T.D.H. Walsh C.T. Biochemistry. 1991; 30: 1673-1682Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar), the value can be ignored when the concentration of the substrate ([S]) is high; therefore, Equations 2 and 3 can be represented as Equations 5 and 6, respectively. We determined the K2 value alone using these equations (Equations 5 and 6).V=Vmax[S]K2+[S](Eq. 5) 1V=1Vmax+K2Vmax1[S](Eq. 6) Enzyme Assay and Kinetic Study of ALR—The enzyme assay and kinetic study of ALR using circular dichroism (CD) spectrometry were performed by a novel method. 2M.

https://openalex.org/W2040369304,"Alanine racemase (ALR), an enzyme that catalyzes the interconversion of Ala enantiomers, is essential for the synthesis of the bacterial cell wall. We have shown that it is harder to inhibit the catalytic activity of ALR from d-cycloserine (DCS)-producing Streptomyces lavendulae than that from Escherichia coli by DCS. To obtain structural evidence for the fact that Streptomyces ALR displays resistance to DCS, we determined the precise nature of the x-ray crystal structures of the cycloserine-free and cycloserine enantiomer-bound forms of Streptomyces ALR at high resolutions. Streptomyces ALR takes a dimer structure, which is formed by interactions between the N-terminal domain of one monomer with the C-terminal domain of its partner. Each of the two active sites of ALR, which is generated as a result of the formation of the dimer structure, is composed of pyridoxal 5′-phosphate (PLP), the PLP-binding residue Lys38, and the amino acids in the immediate environment of the pyridoxal cofactor. The current model suggests that each active site of Streptomyces ALR maintains a larger space and takes a more rigid conformation than that of Bacillus stearothermophilus ALR determined previously. Furthermore, we show that Streptomyces ALR results in a slow conversion to a final form of a pyridoxal derivative arising from either isomer of cycloserine, which inhibits the catalytic activity noncompetitively. In fact, the slow conversion is confirmed by the fact that each enzymebound cycloserine derivative, which is bound to PLP, takes an asymmetric structure.

Gottlieb D. Shaw P.L. Antibiotics, Mechanisms of Action. 1. Springer-Verlag, Heidelberg, GermanyF. C.1967: 40-83Google Scholar). The antibiotic inhibits the enzymatic activities of both Ala racemase (ALR, EC 5.1.1.1) and d-Ala-d-Ala ligase (2Lambert M.P. Neuhaus F.C. J. Bacteriol. 1972; 110: 978-987Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 3David H.L. Takayama K. Goldman D.S. Am. Rev. Respir. Dis. 1969; 100: 579-581PubMed Google Scholar). These enzymes are expressed ubiquitously in bacteria and are indispensable because both d-Ala synthesis and the linkage of two d-Ala molecules are essential for peptidoglycan synthesis in the bacterial cell wall. However, the undesirable side effects of DCS restrict its use in human chemotherapy (4Yew W.W. Wong C.F. Wong P.C. Lee J. Chau C.H. Clin. Infect. Dis. 1993; 17: 288-289Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). Nonetheless, the potent bactericidal effect of DCS makes this antibiotic an attractive prototype compound for developing new mechanism-based antibacterial agents.ALR, which is a target of DCS, belongs to the fold type III group of pyridoxal 5′-phosphate (PLP)-dependent enzymes and catalyzes the interconversion between l-Ala and d-Ala. It has also been shown that DCS and its enantiomer l-cycloserine (LCS) can inhibit the catalytic activity of other PLP-dependent enzymes such as aminotransferases (5Janski A.M. Cornell N.W. Biochem. J. 1981; 194: 1027-1030Crossref PubMed Scopus (6) Google Scholar). Genes encoding ALRs from several bacterial sources have been cloned and characterized (6Diven W.F. Scholz J.J. Johnston R.B.

Bacteriol. 1994; 176: 1500-1510Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) produce two types of ALRs, respectively; one type of ALR is induced by l-Ala and functions in the catabolism of the amino acid, and the other type is constitutively synthesized and contributes to the assembly of peptidoglycan.The crystal structure of ALR from Bacillus stearothermophilus, which is susceptible to DCS (13Fenn T.D. Stamper G.F. Morollo A.A. Ringe D. Biochemistry. 2003; 42: 5775-5783Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar), has been determined at a 1.9 Å resolution (14Shaw J.P. Petsko G.A. Ringe D. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 1329-1342Crossref PubMed Scopus (248) Google Scholar). The structure of the Bacillus ALR, which is bound to the substrate analogues or the ALR inhibitors, has also been analyzed (13Fenn T.D. Stamper G.F. Morollo A.A. Ringe D.

Through crystallographic studies, the catalytic mechanism of ALR, the binding manner between ALR and DCS, and the inhibitory mechanism of ALR by DCS have been proposed. Many substances, including DCS, inhibit the catalytic activity of ALR by a time-dependent mechanism (13Fenn T.D. Stamper G.F. Morollo A.A. Ringe D. Biochemistry. 2003; 42: 5775-5783Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar, 18Wang E. Walsh C. Biochemistry. 1978; 17: 1313-1321Crossref PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar, 19Walsh C.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 2393-2396Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The proposed inactivation pathway (see Scheme 2 in Ref. 13Fenn T.D. Stamper G.F. Morollo A.A. Ringe D. Biochemistry. 2003; 42: 5775-5783Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar) by DCS involves an initial transamination step and is followed by transimination and tautomerization to form a stable aromatic adduct. This scheme is similar to that seen in the inactivation mechanism of aminotransferases by DCS (20Peisach D. Chipman D.M. van Ophem P.W. Manning J.M. Ringe D. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 4958-4967Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar).DCS-producing microorganisms must be protected from the lethal effect of their own product. We noticed that both ALR and d-Ala-d-Ala ligase, targets of DCS from a DCS producer, exhibit resistance to DCS. Therefore, we have cloned genes encoding these two enzymes from DCS-producing S. lavendulae ATCC25233 and characterized their gene products (accompanying article (34Noda M. Kawahara Y. Ichikawa A.

In addition, we performed kinetic studies for enzyme inhibition by DCS and LCS on Streptomyces ALR, which suggest that the time-dependent inhibitory rate of DCS is faster than that of LCS. Interestingly, the inhibitory rate of the cycloserine enantiomers to Streptomyces ALR was about 3-fold lower than that of the E. coli ALR (accompanying article (34Noda M. Kawahara Y. Ichikawa A. Matoba Y. Matsuo H. Lee D.-G. Kumagai T. Sugiyama M. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 46143-46152Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar)) and 4-fold lower than that of B. stearothermophilus ALR (13Fenn T.D. Stamper G.F. Morollo A.A. Ringe D. Biochemistry. 2003; 42: 5775-5783Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar), both of which are susceptible to DCS. This result must be distinguished from a DCS resistance mechanism proposed in Mycobacterium, in which overexpression of ALR contributes to DCS resistance (21Caceres N.E. Harris B. Wellehan J.F. Feng Z. Kapur V. Barletta R.G. J. Bacteriol. 1997; 179: 5046-5055Crossref PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar, 22Feng Z. Barletta R.G. Antimicrob. Agents Chemother. 2003; 47: 283-291Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar). In this study, we show structural and biological evidence that ALR from DCS-producing microorganisms exhibits resistance to DCS.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESCrystallography of Streptomyces ALR—Enzyme expression and purification of the Streptomyces ALR were done as described previously (34Noda M. Kawahara Y. Ichikawa A. Matoba Y. Matsuo H. Lee D.-G. Kumagai T. Sugiyama M. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 46143-46152Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). Prior to crystallization, the purified enzyme solution was dialyzed against a 30 mm Tris-HCl buffer (pH 8.5) containing 50 mm NaCl and 0.5 mm PLP and then concentrated to 10 mg/ml using an Amicon concentrator (Millipore). The resulting enzyme solution contained a 2-fold molar excess of PLP. The Streptomyces ALR crystals were obtained by the sitting-drop vapor diffusion method (23McPherson A. The Preparation and Analysis of Protein Crystals. 1st Ed. John Wiley & Sons Inc., New York1982: 96-97Google Scholar) using 0.1 m Tris-HCl (pH 9.5) containing 1.5 m ammonium sulfate as a precipitant. The crystal belongs to the monoclinic space group C2 with the unit cell dimensions a = 84.0 Å, b = 63.4 Å, c = 86.0 Å, and β = 120.1°, with one protein monomer per asymmetric unit. The diffraction data were collected using a high-speed Rigaku R-AXIS VII imaging plate detector with the CuKα radiation generated by Rigaku FR-E SuperBright. Each oscillation frame was taken with a rotation of 1° for 1 min at a crystal-to-detector distance of 120 mm. Diffraction intensities covering the rotation range of 180° were integrated and scaled by the program CrystalClear (24Corporation Rigaku Molecular Structure CrystalClear. Rigaku Molecular Structure Corp., Orem, Utah2001Google Scholar). A total of 71,155 reflections were merged to 24,889 independent reflections, with an Rmerge of 11.1%. This data set is 94.0% complete to a 2.0 Å resolution.The structure determination was done by the molecular replacement method using the program Amore in the CCP4 suite (25Number Collaborative Computational Project Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D Biol. Crystallogr. 1994; 50: 760-763Crossref PubMed Scopus (19693) Google Scholar). Although the amino acid sequence of ALR from S. lavendulae exhibits only a 34% similarity with that from B. stearothermophilus, as a start model, we used the B. stearothermophilus ALR monomer, which forms a dimeric structure (Protein Data Bank code 1SFT (14Shaw J.P. Petsko G.A. Ringe D. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 1329-1342Crossref PubMed Scopus (248) Google Scholar)). Fig. 1 shows the alignment of amino acid sequences of ALRs from several microbial sources. ALRs were analyzed by using the Internet program ClustalW (26Thompson J.D. Higgins D.G. Gibson T.J. Nucleic Acids Res. 1994; 22: 4673-4680Crossref PubMed Scopus (55133) Google Scholar). Prior to the molecular replacement analysis, we modified a start model based on the sequence information; in other words, inconsistent residues were replaced with Ala residues, and inserted or deleted regions were removed from the model.The atomic coordinates, which were in the top solution obtained by the molecular replacement method, were refined by the combination of simulated annealing (27Brünger A.T. Kuriyan J. Karplus M. Science. 1987; 235: 458-460Crossref PubMed Scopus (2125) Google Scholar) and the conventional restrained refinement (28Konnert J.H. Hendrickson W.A. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. A. 1980; 36: 344-350Crossref Scopus (298) Google Scholar) method using the program X-PLOR (29Brünger A.T. X-PLOR Version 3.1 Manual. Yale University Press, New Haven, CT1993Google Scholar). A subset of 5% of the reflections was used to monitor the free R-factor (Rfree) (30Brünger A.T. Nature. 1992; 355: 472-475Crossref PubMed Scopus (3844) Google Scholar). The refinement was started using the reflections within a 3.5 Å resolution and finished at a 2.0 Å resolution. The refinement of positional parameters and individual isotropic B-factor, the correction using the flat bulk solvent model, and the introduction of water molecules were included in each refinement cycle. The program Xfit in the Xtalview suite (31McRee D.E. J. Mol. Graph. 1992; 10: 44-46Crossref Google Scholar) was used for visualization and model building. In the course of the refinement, the Fo – Fc electron density map clearly showed the presence of PLP covalently bound to the Lys38 amino group. Moreover, a Lys129 residue seemed to be modified to the lysine Nζ-carboxylic acid (KCX), as pointed out for B. stearothermophilus ALR. At the final stage of the X-PLOR refinement, Rfree and R-factor were improved to 25.2 and 19.7%, respectively. The current model contains one protein monomer chain including the unusual KCX residue, one PLP molecule, and 74 water molecules. In the space group, a crystallographic 2-fold axis relates two monomers in the active dimer. The protein monomer in the current model consists of 3–384 residues, since both terminal regions were invisible in the electron density. All residues, except Arg136, Phe220, and Ser269, are in the acceptable region of the Ramachandran plot (32Ramachandran G.N. Ramakrishnan C. Sasisekharan V. J. Mol. Biol. 1963; 7: 95-99Crossref PubMed Scopus (2629) Google Scholar). The root mean square (r.m.s.) deviations from the ideal values (33Engh R.A. Huber R. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. A. 1991; 47: 392-400Crossref Scopus (2536) Google Scholar) in the protein portion are 0.005 Å bond length, 1.1° bond angle, and 0.63° improper angle. The average B-factors are 33.0 Å2 and 29.6 Å2 for 2,851 all-protein atoms and for 89 non-protein atoms, respectively.Crystallography of the DCS-bound Form of ALR—The crystal of Streptomyces ALR bound to DCS was prepared by soaking the noninhibited crystal in a reservoir solution (0.1 m Tris-HCl (pH 9.5) containing 1.8 m ammonium sulfate) containing 50 mm DCS for 12 h. The crystal soaked into the DCS solution belongs to the monoclinic space group P21 with the unit cell dimensions a = 83.0 Å, b = 63.6 Å, c = 84.6 Å, and β = 118.6°, with one dimer per asymmetric unit. Although the unit cell dimensions of the DCS-bound form crystal are almost the same as those of the DCS-unbound form crystal, the diffraction intensities have an adequately high signal-to-noise ratio when h + k equals an odd number. This means that the local 2-fold axis relating the two protein subunits imperfectly corresponds to the crystallographic 2-fold axis, indicating the asymmetric feature of the DCS-bound ALR dimer. Diffraction data was collected using the same detector and x-ray source. Each oscillation frame was taken with a rotation of 1° for 1 min at a crystal-to-detector distance of 120 mm. Diffraction intensities covering the rotation range of 180° were integrated and scaled by the program CrystalClear (24Corporation Rigaku Molecular Structure CrystalClear. Rigaku Molecular Structure Corp., Orem, Utah2001Google Scholar). A total of 218,091 reflections were merged to 60,275 independent reflections, with an Rmerge of 12.8%. This data set is 99.7% complete to a 1.9 Å resolution.The protein structure was determined by the molecular replacement method using the program Amore in the CCP4 suite (25Number Collaborative Computational Project Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D Biol. Crystallogr. 1994; 50: 760-763Crossref PubMed Scopus (19693) Google Scholar). The start model was the previously determined noninhibited form of the Streptomyces ALR dimer, which was generated according to the crystallographic symmetry. Atomic coordinates, obtained by the molecular replacement method, were refined by the program X-PLOR (29Brünger A.T. X-PLOR Version 3.1 Manual. Yale University Press, New Haven, CT1993Google Scholar). The refinement was started using the reflections within a 3.0 Å resolution and finished at a 1.9 Å resolution. In the course of the refinement, the Fo – Fc electron density map clearly shows the presence of the DCS derivatives covalently bound to PLP in the active sites. Solvent atoms having unambiguously strong density when compared with adjacent atoms were interpreted as chloride ions. In the final stage of the X-PLOR refinement, Rfree and R-factor were improved to 26.5 and 20.9%, respectively. The current model contains two protein monomers, including unusual KCX residues, two DCS derivatives bound to the PLP molecule, one chloride ion, and 158 water molecules. One protein monomer in the current dimer model consists of 3–385 residues, and the other subunit consists of 3–384 residues. The Ramachandran plot (32Ramachandran G.N. Ramakrishnan C. Sasisekharan V. J. Mol. Biol. 1963; 7: 95-99Crossref PubMed Scopus (2629) Google Scholar) of the DCS-bound form of Streptomyces ALR is almost the same as that of the DCS-free form (data not shown). The r.m.s. deviations from the ideal values (33Engh R.A. Huber R. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. A. 1991; 47: 392-400Crossref Scopus (2536) Google Scholar) in the protein portion are 0.006 Å bond length, 1.2° bond angle, and 0.65° improper angle. The average B-factors are 26.2 and 24.6 Å2 for 5,712 all-protein atoms and for 202 non-protein atoms, respectively.Crystallography of the LCS-bound Form of ALR—A crystal of LCS-bound Streptomyces ALR was prepared by soaking the ALR crystal in the reservoir solution containing 50 mm LCS for 12 h. The resulting crystal belongs to the monoclinic space group P21 with unit cell dimensions a = 83.8 Å, b = 63.5 Å, c = 85.3 Å, and β = 118.0°, with one dimer per asymmetric unit. Diffraction data were collected using the same method as described above. Each oscillation frame was taken with a rotation of 1° for 2 min at a crystal-to-detector distance of 130 mm. The diffraction intensities covering the rotation range of 180° were integrated and scaled by the program CrystalClear (24Corporation Rigaku Molecular Structure CrystalClear. Rigaku Molecular Structure Corp., Orem, Utah2001Google Scholar). A total of 117,304 reflections were merged to 34,960 independent reflections, with an Rmerge of 12.0%. This data set is 98.7% complete to a 2.3 Å resolution.A rigid-body refinement was done using the DCS-bound type of the Streptomyces ALR dimer, which was previously determined, as a start model. The structural refinement, performed by using the program X-PLOR (29Brünger A.T. X-PLOR Version 3.1 Manual. Yale University Press, New Haven, CT1993Google Scholar), was started using the reflections within a 3.0 Å resolution and finished at a 2.3 Å resolution. Solvent atoms having unambiguously strong density when compared with adjacent atoms were interpreted as chloride ions. In the final stage of the X-PLOR refinement, the Rfree and R-factor were improved to 28.7 and 19.7%, respectively. The current model contains two monomeric proteins including unusual KCX residues, together with two DCS derivatives bound to PLP, one chloride ion, and 117 water molecules. One monomer consists of 4–385 residues, and its partner consists of 5–384 residues. A Ramachandran plot (32Ramachandran G.N. Ramakrishnan C. Sasisekharan V. J. Mol. Biol. 1963; 7: 95-99Crossref PubMed Scopus (2629) Google Scholar) analysis shows that the LCS-bound form is almost the same as the LCS-free form. The r.m.s. deviations from the ideal values (33Engh R.A. Huber R. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. A. 1991; 47: 392-400Crossref Scopus (2536) Google Scholar) in the protein portion are 0.006 Å bond length, 1.2° bond angle, and 0.65° improper angle. The average B-factors are 36.1 and 31.0 Å2 for 5,687 all-protein atoms and for 162 non-protein atoms, respectively.RESULTS AND DISCUSSIONThe Overall Structure of ALR from S. lavendulae—The ALR monomer from S. lavendulae takes an eight-stranded α/β barrel structure at the N terminus, which is characteristic of the proteins carrying a phosphate-binding site (Fig. 2). In addition, the protein takes a dimeric structure, which is formed by interactions between the N-terminal domain of one monomer with the C-terminal domain of its partner. The C-terminal domain takes a distorted barrel structure including a Greek-key motif. In detail, although the C-terminal domain of one monomer interacts with both the N- and C-terminal domains of its partner, the N-terminal domain of one monomer interacts only with the C-terminal domain of its partner. Although the amino acid sequence of Streptomyces ALR displays 34% homology to that of B. stearothermophilus ALR (13Fenn T.D. Stamper G.F. Morollo A.A. Ringe D.

However, in detail, the C-terminal β-strand found in Bacillus ALR is absent in Streptomyces ALR. Fig. 3a shows the superposition of the Bacillus ALR dimer (14Shaw J.P. Petsko G.A. Ringe D. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 1329-1342Crossref PubMed Scopus (248) Google Scholar) on the Streptomyces ALR dimer. When the superposition matrix is calculated using the Cα atoms of structurally corresponding residues (final distance < 5 Å) between two ALRs, the positional r.m.s. differences are 1.95 and 1.75 Å for the dimeric and monomeric structures, respectively. Remarkably, the positional relations of the C-terminal domain to the N-terminal domain of the monomer itself are distinguishable between two ALRs. When the fitting of the N-terminal domains between both ALRs is done, the C-terminal domain is not superimposed (Fig. 3b). The positional r.m.s. difference between the resting C-terminal domains from both ALRs is 3.32 Å for 128 Cα atoms. This is because the distance between the gravity centers of the N- and C-terminal domains of the Streptomyces ALR monomer is smaller than that of the Bacillus ALR monomer. The Streptomyces ALR dimer structure displays a large anisotropy in its shape. The complementarity between the two monomers of the Streptomyces ALR is lower than that of the Bacillus ALR. In fact, the decreased accessible surface area on the binding of the two monomers of the Streptomyces ALR is estimated to be 2,800 Å2, whereas that of the Bacillus ALR is estimated to be 3,200 Å2.Fig. 2Ribbon view of the Streptomyces ALR dimer structure. The two subunits that form the dimer structure of the Streptomyces ALR are shown in different colors (red and blue).

The Streptomyces ALR model reveals that almost all critical amino acid residues that form the active site around the PLP moiety are conserved in the Bacillus ALR (Fig. 1). Especially, the degree of conservation is high for the residues that interact with the phosphate of PLP and participate in the hydrogen-bonding network around the PLP ring.Each PLP is near the center of the barrel and closer to the C-terminal domain of the partner monomer. PLP covalently binds to Lys38, similar to Lys39 of the Bacillus ALR (Fig. 4). The phosphate group of PLP forms several hydrogen bonds with the side-chain atoms of residues Tyr42, Tyr361, and Ser209 and with the main-chain atoms of residues Ser209, Gly226, and Leu227 in the same subunit of Streptomyces ALR. These residues are completely conserved in the Bacillus ALR (Tyr43, Tyr354, Ser204, Gly221, and Ile222).Fig. 4Comparison of the active site around PLP between ALRs from S. lavendulae (a) and B. stearothermophilus (b). Carbon atoms of the residues from each subunit are colored differently (orange and cyan), and those from the PLP molecule are shown in the same color as their bonding subunits. An acetate molecule is found only in b, and its carbon atoms are indicated in purple.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT)The pyridine ring of PLP is held in place by an important hydrogen bond between its N-1 atom and the Nϵ of Arg224 in the Streptomyces ALR. The guanidinium group is part of a long hydrogen-bonding network involving the side-chain atoms of Arg136, Tyr270′ (from the other subunit of the dimer, indicated by the ′ symbol), His168, Arg224, His205, Gln127, Asp101, and Arg125. The five residues are conserved in the Bacillus ALR (Arg136, Tyr265′, His166, Arg219, and His200). In the Bacillus ALR, the imidazole group of His127, which corresponds to Gln127 of the Streptomyces ALR, forms a hydrogen-bonding network with the side-chain atoms of His200 and Glu161. The guanidinium group of Arg224 also forms a hydrogen bond with the main-chain atoms of Ser167. In the Bacillus ALR, Ser167 is conservatively replaced by Thr165.The side chain of Arg136 may interact weakly with the phenolic oxygen of the PLP ring, although the distance between the phenolic oxygen of PLP and the Nη-2 atom of Arg136 is out of the range of acceptable hydrogen-bond distance. This residue is also conserved in the Bacillus ALR as Arg136 and unambiguously forms a hydrogen bond with the phenolic oxygen of PLP. The side chain of Arg136 is stabilized by the formation of two hydrogen bonds with the carboxylate of the unusual residue KCX129. This observation holds true in the case of the Bacillus ALR complexed with the cycloserine enantiomer, although an unusual KCX residue is not assigned at position 129 in the DCS-free Bacillus ALR structure. The phenolic oxygen of PLP is the starting point of a local hydrogen-bonding network involving Lys38, Trp84, Asp319′, Gln320′, and one water molecule. The phenolic oxygen forms one water-mediated hydrogen bond with the carboxylate of Asp319′, the amine group derived from Lys38, and the Nϵ-1 atom of Trp84, and the carboxylate of Asp319′ further bonds to the Gln320′ side chain. Trp84 of the Streptomyces ALR is replaced by aliphatic Leu85 in the Bacillus ALR, whereas Asp319′ and Gln320′ are conserved in the Bacillus ALR (Asp313′ and Gln314′). In the case of the DCS-free Bacillus ALR, this local hydrogen-bonding network is not conserved. The phenolic oxygen of PLP forms two water-mediated hydrogen bonds with the carboxylate of Asp313′, and the carboxylate of Asp313′ further bonds to the side chain of Arg363′ rather than to Gln314′. A covalent double bond that links the Lys38 amino group and PLP is trans-configured in the Streptomyces ALR, whereas the cor"

Hyperosmotic stress-stimulated FAK phosphorylation at Tyr-397 occurred via a Src-independent pathway, whereas Tyr-577 phosphorylation was completely blocked by exposure to the Src family kinase inhibitor PP-2. Inhibition of p38 MAP kinase or phosphatidylinositol 3-kinases did not prevent FAK phosphorylation stimulated by hyperosmotic stress. Overexpression of N17 RhoA did not reduce hyperosmotic stress-mediated localization of phosphorylated FAK to focal contacts and treatment with the Rho-associated kinase inhibitor Y-27632 did not prevent FAK translocation and tyrosine phosphorylation in response to hyperosmotic stress. Overexpression of N17 Rac only slightly altered the hyperosmotic stress-mediated localization of phosphorylated FAK to focal contacts. In contrast, overexpression of the N17 mutant of Cdc42 disrupted hyperosmotic stress-stimulated FAK Tyr-397 localization to focal contacts. Additionally, treatment of cells with Clostridium difficile toxin B potently inhibited hyperosmotic stress-induced FAK tyrosine phosphorylation. Furthermore, FAK null fibroblasts compared with their FAK containing controls show markedly increased sensitivity, manifest by subsequent apoptosis, to sustained hyperosmotic stress. Our results indicate that FAK plays a fundamental role in protecting cells from hyperosmotic stress, and that the pathway(s) that mediates FAK autophosphorylation at Tyr-397 in response to osmotic stress can be distinguished from the pathways utilized by many other stimuli, including neuropeptides and bioactive lipids (Rho- and Rho-associated kinase-dependent), tyrosine kinase receptor agonists (phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase-dependent), and integrins (Src-dependent).

A successful response to hyperosmotic stress is of fundamental importance to cell survival as evidenced by the remarkable conservation of cellular osmotic stress response pathways from yeast to humans.

FAK is rapidly phosphorylated on multiple tyrosines, including Tyr-397, the major autophosphorylation site, Tyr-576 and Tyr-577 (within the FAK kinase activation loop), and Tyr-861 and Tyr-925 in cells stimulated by extracellular ligands. The biological importance of FAK is underscored by the fact that FAK-/- knockout animals are not viable, exhibiting a defect in mesodermal development and cells that showed impaired locomotion (44Ilic D. Furuta Y. Kanazawa S. Takeda N. Sobue K. Nakatsuji N. Nomura S. Fujimoto J. Okada M. Yamamoto T. Nature. 1995; 377: 539-544Crossref PubMed Scopus (1587) Google Scholar). FAK activation has also been shown to block p53-mediated anoikis when epithelial cells are deprived of their extracellular matrix attachments (45Ilic D. Almeida E.A. Schlaepfer D.D. Dazin P. Aizawa S. Damsky C.H. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 143: 547-560Crossref PubMed Scopus (436) Google Scholar). It has recently been demonstrated that FAK and Pyk2, although structurally related, are differentially regulated in many systems (46Schaller M.D. Sasaki T. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 25319-25325Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar), and their functions have been shown in some instances to be mutually antagonistic (47Roy S. Ruest P.J. Hanks S.K. J. Cell. Biochem. 2002; 84: 377-388Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). The potential role of FAK in anti-apoptotic signaling in response to hyperosmotic stress has not been examined. In the present study, we demonstrate that exposure to sucrose or sorbitol leading to hyperosmotic stress rapidly and robustly stimulates FAK phosphorylation at Tyr-397, the major autophosphorylation site, and at Tyr-577, within the kinase activation loop, in Swiss 3T3 cells. The results presented in this study imply that FAK autophosphorylation at Tyr-397 in response to osmotic stress is mediated through a pathway(s) that can be distinguished from the pathways utilized by neuropeptides and bioactive lipids (Rho- and ROK-dependent), tyrosine kinase agonists (PI 3-kinase-dependent) and integrins (Src-dependent). In contrast, overexpression of the N17 mutant of Cdc42 disrupted hyperosmotic stress-stimulated localization of FAK phosphorylated at Tyr-397 to focal contacts. Furthermore, treatment of Swiss 3T3 cells with Clostridium difficile toxin B potently inhibits hyperosmotic stress-induced FAK Tyr-397 phosphorylation. Additionally, we show that FAK-/- fibroblasts derived from FAK null embryos are markedly more susceptible to sustained hyperosmotic stress exposure, undergoing increased apoptosis compared with FAK expressing fibroblasts exposed for equal lengths of time. Src-null cells also exhibit similar susceptibility to hyperosmotic stress-induced apoptosis compared with c-Src-expressing cells. These results indicate a novel signaling cascade leading to FAK/Src activation in Swiss 3T3 cells in response to hyperosmotic stress and support the idea that the FAK and c-Src participate in protecting mammalian cells from hyperosmotic stress. Cell Culture—Stock cultures of Swiss 3T3 cells were maintained in DMEM, supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum in a humidified atmosphere containing 10% CO2 and 90% air at 37 °C. For experimental purposes, Swiss 3T3 cells were plated in 100-mm dishes at 6 × 105cells/dish in DMEM supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum and used after 6–8 days when cells were confluent and quiescent.

Cell Stimulation with Bombesin or Other Agonists—Confluent and quiescent Swiss 3T3 cells were washed twice with DMEM, equilibrated in the same media at 37 °C for at least 30 min, and then treated with bombesin or other agonists for the times indicated. The stimulation was terminated by aspirating the medium and lysing the cells in 1 ml of ice-cold RIPA buffer containing 50 mm HEPES, pH 7.4, 1% Triton X-100, 1% sodium deoxycholate, 0.1% SDS, 150 mm NaCl, 10% glycerol, 1.5% mm MgCl2, 1 mm EGTA, 1 mm sodium orthovanadate, 10 mm sodium pyrophosphate, 100 mm NaF, and 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride. Cell Stimulation by Hypertonicity—Confluent and quiescent Swiss 3T3 cells were washed twice with DMEM, equilibrated in the same media at 37 °C for at least 30 min, and then the media was exchanged for 0.45 m sucrose, 0.6 m sorbitol, or 0.45 m urea in DMEM at 37 °C for the times indicated in the figure legends. The stimulation was terminated by rapid rinsing in ice-cold PBS followed by aspirating the medium and solubilizing the cells in 1 ml of ice-cold RIPA buffer as above or in 4× SDS-PAGE sample buffer. Immunoprecipitation—Lysates were clarified by centrifugation at 14,000 rpm for 10 min. Supernatants were transferred to fresh tubes, and proteins were immunoprecipitated at 4 °C for 4 h with 1 μg/ml polyclonal anti-FAK (C20), 1 μg/ml monoclonal anti-paxillin antibody, 1 μg/ml anti-CAS monoclonal antibody, or 1 μg/ml anti-phosphotyrosine antibody (PY20). The antibodies were precoupled to protein A-agarose prior to immunoprecipitation. Immunoprecipitates were washed three times with RIPA buffer and extracted in 4× SDS-PAGE sample buffer (400 mm Tris-HCl, pH 6.8, 2 mm EDTA, 12% SDS, 8% 2-mercaptoethanol, 20% glycerol) by boiling 10 min and analyzed by SDS-PAGE. Western Blotting—After SDS-PAGE, proteins were transferred to Immobilon-P (polyvinylidene difluoride) membranes. After transfer, membranes were blocked using 5% nonfat dried milk in PBS, pH 7.2, and incubated overnight at 4 °C with the anti-FAK-Tyr(P)-397 Ab (0.1 μg/ml), anti-FAK-Tyr(P)-577 Ab (1 μg/ml), anti-Paxillin mAb (0.1 μg/ml), anti-CAS mAb (0.1 μg/ml), or anti-phosphotyrosine mAb (0.1 μg ml) as indicated in the figure legends. The membranes were washed three times with PBS, 0.1% Tween 20 (PBST) and then incubated with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibodies (donkey anti-rabbit or sheep anti-mouse) at 1:5000 for 1 h at room temperature. After washing four times with PBST, the immunoreactive bands were visualized using enhanced chemiluminescence (ECL) detection reagents and photographic film. Immunofluorescence—20% confluent Swiss 3T3 cells were washed 2 times in serum-free DMEM treated as indicated in the figure legends and fixed in 10% phosphate-buffered formalin (Fisher) for 30 min followed by permeabilization with Tris-buffered saline (TBS) with 0.1% Triton X-100 for 5 min. Cells were blocked in TBS with 1% bovine serum albumin, 2% fetal bovine serum overnight and incubated with anti-FAK-Tyr(P)-397 Ab for 4 h followed by Alexa Fluor 488 or 594 goat anti-rabbit (Molecular Probes, Eugene, OR) secondary antibodies for 1 h. The N17 Rho family mutant expressing cells were also stained with primary anti-hemagglutinin (HA) epitope monoclonal antibody along with the anti-FAK-Tyr(P)-397 polyclonal Ab. Dual images were obtained after incubating for 1 h with Alexa Fluor 488 chicken anti-mouse and Alexa Fluor 594 chicken anti-rabbit secondary antibodies. Cells were imaged with an epifluorescence microscope (Zeiss Axioskop), and a Zeiss water immersion objective (Achroplan 40/0.75 w, Carl Zeiss, Inc., Jena, Germany). Alexa Fluor 488 or Alexa Fluor 594 signals were observed with HI Q filter sets for FITC or rhodamine isothiocyanate, respectively (Chroma Technology). Images were captured as uncompressed 12-bit TIFF files with a SPOT cooled (-12 °C) single CCD color digital camera (three pass method) driven by SPOT version 2.1 software (Diagnostic Instruments, Inc., Sterling Heights, MI). Images were processed using Adobe Photoshop CS. For N17 Cdc42-transfected cells treated with hyperosmotic stress (because of marked cell rounding), images were obtained using a Zeiss LSM510META confocal microscope (Carl Zeiss Inc.) using two separate lasers and emission filters: using the 488-nm argon laser line for excitation of Alexa Fluor 488, and the 543-nm laser line for the excitation of Alexa Fluor 594. Selected cells in the appropriate images are representative of 70–80% of cells. N17 Rho Family (RhoA, Rac1, and Cdc42) GTPase Expression—Swiss 3T3 cells were in plated 35-mm dishes at 3 × 105 cells/dish and transfected 18–20 h later. Cells were transfected with 1 μg of DNA/33-mm dish using LipofectAMINE Plus (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's suggested conditions. Transfections were carried out with equivalent amounts of DNA. Transfected cells were incubated for 18–20 h before agonist or hyperosmotic stress exposure. Cdc42-GTP Pull-down Assay—Confluent, cultures of IEC-18 cells were serum starved overnight, and washed with warm serum-free DMEM 30 min before starting stimulation. Cells were then incubated in DMEM in the presence or absence of 0.45 m sucrose for 30 min at 37 °C. After which the cells were rapidly washed 1 time in PBS at room temperature, and lysed in ice-cold lysis buffer containing, 50 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 10 mm MgCl2, 0.3 m NaCl, and 2% IGEPAL (polyoxyethylene nonylphenol) supplemented with 1× protease inhibitor mixture (Cytoskeleton, Inc., Denver, CO). Lysates were clarified by centrifuging for 5 min at 8,000 rpm in a 4 °C microcentrifuge. Samples of clarified lysates were saved for loading controls. 20 μl of glutathione-agarose beads, to which a fusion protein, glutathione S-transferase-CBD (Cdc42-binding domain), of WASP is bound (Cytoskeleton, Inc.) and 10 μlof100× protease inhibitor mixture (Cytoskeleton, Inc.) were added to 1 ml of the freshly obtained clarified lysates and the mixture was incubated at 4 °C on a rotator for 1 h. Beads were pelleted by centrifugation at 5,000 × g for 3 min at 4 °C. The pelleted beads were then washed in ice-cold wash buffer containing, 25 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 30 mm MgCl2, 40 mm NaCl. The washed beads were then resuspended in 20 μl of 4× SDS-PAGE sample buffer (400 mm Tris-HCl, pH 6.8, 2 mm EDTA, 12% SDS, 8% 2-mercaptoethanol, 20% glycerol), boiled 10 min, and the attached protein, along with the saved clarified lysates, were analyzed by SDS-PAGE. Western blots were performed as in the above protocol (membrane corresponding to molecular weights below 97,000) with anti-Cdc42 primary antibody (Cytoskeleton, Inc.) or (membrane corresponding to molecular weights above 97,000) with anti-FAK-Tyr(P)-397 Ab (0.1 μg/ml). Apoptosis Assay—FAK-/-, FAK+/+, SYF, or YF cells were plated at 1 × 104 cell/35-mm dish and after 5 days in culture (90% confluent) they were washed 2 times in DMEM, then exposed to DMEM alone or DMEM containing 0.45 m sucrose for increasing times at 37 °C, after which they were washed 3 times with DMEM. They were then incubated for a further 24 h after which they were fixed in phosphate-buffered formalin (Fisher) for 30 min followed by permeabilization with TBS with 0.1% Triton X-100 for 5 min. Cells were then washed in TBS and incubated in FITC-labeled dUTP and dNTP in reaction buffer (200 mm potassium cacodylate, 25 mm Tris-HCl, 1 mm CoCl2, 0.25 mg/ml bovine serum albumin, pH 6.6; Roche Diagnostics GmbH) in the presence or absence of terminal deoxynucleotide transferase (Roche Diagnostics GmbH) for 60 min at 37 °C in a humidified incubator. Following terminal deoxynucleotide transferase reaction, cells were washed 3 times in TBS, then imaged immediately (FAK-/- and FAK+/+ cells) or further stained with a 1:5000 dilution of 4′,6′-diamidino-2-phenylindole (Molecular Probes, Inc.) for 30 min at room temperature, followed by a further washing 3 times in TBS. Cells were imaged with an epifluorescence microscope (Zeiss Axioskop) with a Zeiss water immersion objective (Achroplan 40/0.75 w, Carl Zeiss, Inc.) under FITC fluorescence and DIC settings (FAK-/- and FAK+/+ cells), or under FITC fluorescence and 4′,6′-diamidino-2-phenylindole settings (SYF and YF cells) and photographed with a CCD camera. Images were processed using Adobe Photoshop CS. Statistical Analysis of Apoptosis Quantification—5 high powered fields were photographed per experiment and the FITC positive fragmented nuclei were counted as were the total number of cells/field (over 900 total cells were counted/experimental group). Statistical significance was determined by a one-tailed Student's t test as described by Jekel et al. (50Jekel J.F. Elmore J.G. Katz D.L. Epidemiology, Biostatistics, and Preventive Medicine. Saunders, Philadelphia, PA1996Google Scholar). Materials—Bombesin, sucrose (ultra-pure), and sorbitol (ultra-pure) were all obtained from Sigma. Horseradish peroxidase-conjugated donkey anti-rabbit antibody (NA 934) and sheep anti-mouse antibody and ECL reagents were from Amersham Biosciences. PY-20 anti-phosphotyrosine mAb was from ICN, and the 4G10 anti-phosphotyrosine mAb was from UBI, Lake Placid, NY. Anti-paxillin and anti-CAS monoclonal antibodies were obtained from Signal Transduction Laboratories. Anti-FAK antibody C20 was from Santa Cruz Biotechnology (Santa Cruz, CA). The polyclonal phospho-specific Abs to FAK Tyr-397, FAK Tyr-577, or total FAK (C20) were obtained from BIOSOURCE International (Camarillo, CA), PP-2 and PP-3 were obtained from Calbiochem-Novabiochem. cDNA plasmids encoding influenza-HA-tagged L17N mutants of RhoA, Rac1, and Cdc42 were obtained from Guthrie cDNA resource center, Guthrie Research Institute, Sayre, PA. All other reagents used were of the highest grade available. CBD-WASP beads, anti-Cdc42 polyclonal antibody, wash, and lysis buffers for Cdc42 pull-down assay all obtained from Cytoskeleton, Inc. Hyperosmotic Stress Stimulates Tyrosine Phosphorylation of FAK: Both on FAK Tyr-397 and FAK Tyr-577—To determine whether exposure of mammalian cells to hyperosmotic stress increases the tyrosine phosphorylation of FAK, quiescent Swiss 3T3 cells were incubated in media containing 0.45 m sucrose, or 0.6 m sorbitol for 10 min at 37 °C and then lysed. The cell extracts were incubated with anti-FAK polyclonal antibody and the immunoprecipitates were analyzed by Western blot with an anti-phosphotyrosine mAb. Fig. 1A shows that hypertonic stress induced by either 0.45 m sucrose or 0.6 m sorbitol caused a marked increase in FAK tyrosine phosphorylation. The increase in FAK tyrosine phosphorylation in response to hyperosmotic stress was comparable with that induced by cell stimulation with 5 nm bombesin or 20% fetal bovine serum, shown for comparison. Immunoprecipitation with anti-FAK followed by Western blot with the same antibody (lower blot) shows that recovery of FAK from cell lysates is not altered by hyperosmotic treatment. The results shown in Fig. 1A demonstrate that hyperosmotic stress by either sucrose or sorbitol induces FAK tyrosine phosphorylation in Swiss 3T3 cells. Many stimuli, including integrin clustering by fibronectin, and GPCR stimulation by bombesin and other agonists, lead to FAK tyrosine phosphorylation at Tyr-397 (autophosphorylation site) and FAK Tyr-577 (one of two Src phosphorylation sites within the FAK activation loop). Consequently, we examined whether these sites were phosphorylated in response to hyperosmotic stress stimulation. Confluent and quiescent Swiss 3T3 cells were exposed to 0.45 m sucrose at 37 °C for increasing times. Cell lysates were analyzed by SDS-PAGE and Western blot using antibodies that detect the phosphorylated state of FAK tyrosine 397 (FAK Tyr(P)-397), or tyrosine 577 (FAK Tyr(P)-577). Fig. 1B shows representative blots probed for FAK Tyr("
https://openalex.org/W2021921293,"The nitrogen-fixing filamentous cyanobacterium Nostoc PCC 7120 (formerly named Anabaena PCC 7120) possesses two genes for superoxide dismutase, a unique membrane-associated manganese superoxide dismutase (MnSOD) and a soluble iron superoxide dismutase (FeSOD). A phylogenetic analysis of FeSODs shows that cyanobacterial enzymes form a well separated cluster with filamentous species found in one subcluster and unicellular species in the other. Activity staining, inhibition patterns, and immunogold labeling show that FeSOD is localized in the cytosol of vegetative cells and heterocysts (nitrogenase containing specialized cells formed during nitrogen-limiting conditions). The recombinant Nostoc FeSOD is a homodimeric, acidic enzyme exhibiting the characteristic iron peak at 350 nm in its ferric state, an almost 100% occupancy of iron per subunit, a specific activity using the ferricytochrome assay of (2040 ± 90) units mg–1 at pH 7.8, and a dissociation constant Kd of the azide-FeSOD complex of 2.1 mm. Using stopped flow spectroscopy it was shown that the decay of superoxide in the presence of various FeSOD concentrations is first-order in enzyme concentration allowing the calculation of the catalytic rate constants, which increase with decreasing pH: 5.3 × 109m–1 s–1 (pH 7) to 4.8 × 106m–1 s–1 (pH 10). FeSOD and MnSOD complement each other to keep the superoxide level low in Nostoc PCC 7120, which is discussed with respect to the fact that Nostoc PCC 7120 exhibits oxygenic photosynthesis and oxygen-dependent respiration within a single prokaryotic cell and also has the ability to form differentiated cells under nitrogen-limiting conditions.

FeSOD and MnSOD complement each other to keep the superoxide level low in Nostoc PCC 7120, which is discussed with respect to the fact that Nostoc PCC 7120 exhibits oxygenic photosynthesis and oxygen-dependent respiration within a single prokaryotic cell and also has the ability to form differentiated cells under nitrogen-limiting conditions. Cyanobacteria are oxygenic, phototrophic prokaryotes combining the mechanisms of plant-type photosynthesis and cytochrome c oxidase-based respiration in one cell (1Peschek G.A. Obinger C. Paumann M. Physiol. Plant. 2004; 120: 358-369Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). Because the cyanobacteria were the first organisms that produced molecular oxygen they necessarily had to find a way to balance between death and life, because in aerobic organisms active oxygen species such as superoxide radicals, hydroxyl radicals, and hydrogen peroxide are inevitably formed. For the efficient removal of reactive oxygen species the cyanobacteria, as well as other organisms, developed quite a number of strategies including redox enzymes such as superoxide dismutases (SODs). 1The abbreviations used are: SOD, superoxide dismutase; CM, cytoplasmic or plasma membrane; DMF, dimethylformamide; FeSOD, iron-containing superoxide dismutase; ICM, intracytoplasmic or thylakoid membrane; MnSOD, manganese-containing superoxide dismutase; PCC, Pasteur Culture Collection; PMSF, phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride; Pipes, 1,4-piperazinediethanesulfonic acid; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline.1The abbreviations used are: SOD, superoxide dismutase; CM, cytoplasmic or plasma membrane; DMF, dimethylformamide; FeSOD, iron-containing superoxide dismutase; ICM, intracytoplasmic or thylakoid membrane; MnSOD, manganese-containing superoxide dismutase; PCC, Pasteur Culture Collection; PMSF, phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride; Pipes, 1,4-piperazinediethanesulfonic acid; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline. Genome analysis (www.kazusa.or.jp/cyano/cyano.html) shows that cyanobacteria possess either one or more SOD genes encoding SODs with iron, manganese, copper-zinc, or nickel at the active site (2Regelsberger G. Atzenhofer W. Rüker F. Peschek G.A. Jakopitsch C. Paumann M. Furtmüller P.G. Obinger C. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 43615-43622Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). The filamentous, nitrogen-fixing cyanobacterium Nostoc PCC 7120 (formerly named Anabaena PCC 7120) was recently shown to contain two genes for SODs, namely a sodB gene encoding an iron-containing and a sodA gene encoding a manganese-containing superoxide dismutase (2Regelsberger G. Atzenhofer W. Rüker F. Peschek G.A. Jakopitsch C. Paumann M. Furtmüller P.G. Obinger C. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 43615-43622Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). Nostoc PCC 7120 forms heterocysts when the filaments are grown under nitrogen-limiting conditions (3Golden J.W. Yoon H.S. Curr. Opin. Microbiol. 1998; 1: 623-629Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). Mature heterocysts are the site of nitrogen fixation and contain nitrogenase, the enzyme that catalyzes the reduction of atmospheric nitrogen to ammonia. Because nitrogenase is irreversibly inhibited upon exposure to molecular oxygen or activated oxygen species (4Fay P. Microbiol. Rev. 1992; 56: 340-373Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), several strategies are necessary to protect this ancient enzyme: (i) heterocysts have no oxygen-evolving activity because they lack photosystem II (4Fay P. Microbiol. Rev. 1992; 56: 340-373Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), (ii) they are surrounded by a thick cell wall (5Walsby A.E. Proc. R. Soc. Lond. B. 1985; 226: 345-366Crossref Scopus (123) Google Scholar), and (iii) they have a high activity of respiration which consumes oxygen (6Wastyn M. Achatz A. Molitor V. Peschek G.A. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1988; 935: 217-224Crossref Scopus (29) Google Scholar). In nonheterocyst nitrogen-fixing cyanobacteria, nitrogen fixation and oxygenic photosynthesis are separated temporally or spatially (7Berman-Frank I. Lundgren P. Chen Y.-B. Küpper H. Kolber Z. Bergmann B. Falkowski P. Science. 2001; 294: 1534-1537Crossref PubMed Scopus (285) Google Scholar). The protection mechanism in heterocysts is not perfect. The thick cell wall does not totally exclude oxygen penetration into the cells (5Walsby A.E. Proc. R. Soc. Lond. B. 1985; 226: 345-366Crossref Scopus (123) Google Scholar), and both the respiratory electron transport and photosystem I contribute to the formation of superoxide radicals (4Fay P. Microbiol. Rev. 1992; 56: 340-373Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Thus, superoxide dismutase activity is necessary in both vegetative cells and heterocysts of cyanobacteria in order to protect against cellular damage by superoxide. We have reported that Nostoc PCC 7120 MnSOD is unique in being membrane-bound and presented a comprehensive biochemical and biophysical characterization of this enzyme (2Regelsberger G. Atzenhofer W. Rüker F. Peschek G.A. Jakopitsch C. Paumann M. Furtmüller P.G. Obinger C. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 43615-43622Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). MnSOD is localized in both cytoplasmic and thylakoid membranes (2Regelsberger G. Atzenhofer W. Rüker F. Peschek G.A. Jakopitsch C. Paumann M. Furtmüller P.G. Obinger C. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 43615-43622Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). Recently, the 2.0-Å structure of the catalytic portion of the MnSOD was reported (8Atzenhofer W. Regelsberger G. Jacob U. Peschek G.A. Furtmüller P.G. Huber R. Obinger C. J. Mol. Biol. 2002; 321: 479-489Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). Membrane attachment of Nostoc MnSOD was confirmed by immunoblotting and activity staining (9Li T. Huang X. Zhou R. Liu Y. Li B. Nomura C. Zhao J. J. Bacteriol. 2002; 184: 5096-5103Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). To complete the characterization of SODs in Nostoc PCC 7120 and understand superoxide detoxification in nitrogen-fixing heterocystous cyanobacteria, we cloned the sodB gene from this organism and performed a comprehensive biochemical and kinetic investigation including the determination of actual bimolecular rate constants at pH 7–10. Its localization in the cytosol of both vegetative cells and heterocysts is presented as well as its phylogenetic relationship with other cyanobacterial FeSODs. Comparing these findings with those from MnSOD obtained under identical experimental conditions, we conclude that FeSOD and MnSOD complement each other in Nostoc PCC 7120 to protect cell components from oxidative stress. The physiological relevance is discussed with respect to the bioenergetic peculiarities of cyanobacteria as well as to nitrogen fixation in heterocysts. The SOD equipment of Nostoc PCC 7120 is compared with that of other cyanobacteria. Enzymes and chemicals were used from the following companies: alkaline phosphatase from Roche Applied Science; T4 DNA ligase, NcoI and XhoI restriction enzymes from MBI Fermentas; ExTaq DNA polymerase from TaKaRa; Epoxy resin kit from Multilab; bovine serum albumin, lysozyme (from chicken egg white), DNase I (from bovine pancreas), PMSF, leupeptin, pepstatin A, fibrinogen type IV (from bovine plasma), thrombin (from bovine plasma), SigmaMarker (wide molecular weight range), electrophoresis kit for isoelectric focusing, cytochrome c (from horse heart), xanthine, xanthine oxidase (from buttermilk grade I), 18-crown-6-ether, 3-Å molecular sieve and potassium superoxide from Sigma; the GFX PCR DNA and gel band purification kit, gel filtration LMW calibration kit, chelating Sepharose fast flow, Superdex 200 prep grade, and PD-10 desalting columns from Amersham Biosciences; Bio-Lyte 3/6 and 3/10 Ampholyte from Bio-Rad; and the Centriprep-30 concentrators from Amicon. All other reagents were of the highest grade available. Growth Conditions and Preparation of Cytosolic and Membrane Extracts of Vegetative Cells—Axenic cultures of Nostoc PCC 7120 were grown photoautotrophically in BG-11 medium (10Stanier R.Y. Kunisawa R. Mandel M. Cohen-Bazire G. Bacteriol. Rev. 1971; 35: 171-205Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) at 35 °C for 1 week. During growth they were illuminated with cool white fluorescent light and bubbled with filtered air containing 1% (v/v) of CO2. Filaments were harvested by centrifugation (4000 × g, 10 min, 4 °C), washed twice with Hepes-EDTA buffer (10 mm Hepes/NaOH, pH 7.4, 5 mm NaCl, 2 mm Na2EDTA) and resuspended in the same buffer to a cell density of 80 μl/ml of packed cells. The suspension was made up to 20% (w/w) sucrose and 0.5% lysozyme, incubated at 37 °C for 2 h and centrifuged (3000 × g, 10 min, 4 °C). Thereafter, the pellet was resuspended in Hepes-EDTA buffer containing 0.0075% DNase I, incubated on ice for 30 min, passed twice through a precooled French pressure cell (Aminco) at 40 and 70 MPa, respectively, and centrifuged (5000 × g, 10 min, 4 °C). Then the supernatant was used to separate membrane vesicles and cytosolic components by ultracentrifugation (250,000 × g, 50 min, 4 °C) or adjusted to 42% (w/w) with solid sucrose for discontinuous density gradient centrifugation. This solution was overlaid with 35, 30, and 10% (w/w) sucrose in Hepes/NaOH buffer and centrifuged (Beckman SW-27 rotor, 131,500 × g, 16 h, 4 °C). The cytoplasmic membrane (orange layer) and thylakoid fractions (dark green layer) obtained by density gradient centrifugation were recentrifuged severalfold to reduce cross-contamination. All buffers contained 1 mm PMSF, 5 μm leupeptin, and 5 μm pepstatin A to reduce proteolytic degradation (11Peschek G.A. Wastyn M. Trnka M. Molitor V. Fry I.V. Packer L. Biochemistry. 1989; 28: 3057-3063Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). Preparation of Heterocyst Extracts—To obtain filaments containing heterocystous cells, Nostoc PCC 7120 was grown similar to that described above but using nitrogen-free BG-11 medium (10Stanier R.Y. Kunisawa R. Mandel M. Cohen-Bazire G. Bacteriol. Rev. 1971; 35: 171-205Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Cyanobacterial cells were centrifuged (4000 × g, 10 min, room temperature), washed twice with 30 mm Hepes-Pipes-KOH buffer (with 10 mm Na2EDTA, pH 7.2), suspended in 10 mm Hepes-KOH buffer (with 10 mm MgCl2, 300 mm mannitol, 0.5% bovine serum albumin, 0.5% lysozyme, pH 7.2), and incubated at 35 °C for 1 h at a cell density of 50 μl of packed cells per ml. The lysozyme-treated cells were pelleted, washed twice with lysozyme-free mannitol buffer, resuspended in 30 mm Hepes-Pipes-KOH buffer (with 1 mm MgCl2, 0.0075% DNase I, pH 7.2) to a cell density of 50 μl of packed cells per ml, and extruded through a precooled French pressure cell (Aminco) at 34.5 MPa and 4 °C. Unaffected heterocysts were separated from broken vegetative cells by centrifugation (4000 × g, 4 min, 4 °C) and disrupted by French Press extrusion at 138 MPa and 4 °C (6Wastyn M. Achatz A. Molitor V. Peschek G.A. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1988; 935: 217-224Crossref Scopus (29) Google Scholar). The membranes and cytosolic components of heterocysts were separated as described for vegetative cells. Electron Microscopy Combined with Immunogold Labeling—Samples of Nostoc PCC 7120 were agglutinated with a thrombin-fibrinogen solution, fixed with 3% glutaraldehyde (in 0.2 m phosphate buffer, pH 7.2) for 2 h, washed twice with 0.2 m phosphate buffer for 5 min, and post-fixed with 1% osmium tetroxide (in 0.2 m phosphate buffer, pH 7.2) for 2 h. Subsequently, samples were dehydrated by incubation in solutions of increasing ethanol and propylene oxide concentration and embedded in epoxy resin using resin-propylene oxide mixtures of increasing resin concentration. After drying at 40 °C for 2 h, the specimens were polymerized at 60 °C for 2 days. Ultrathin sections were produced using the Ultracut E ultramicrotome (Reichert-Jung) and mounted on 200-mesh nickel grids. The grids were treated with 5% H2O2 for 5 min, washed with PBS-T (PBS containing 0.1% Tween-20), and blocked with 5% bovine serum albumin (in PBS-T) for 30 min. The grids were incubated overnight in rabbit anti-FeSOD antibody, diluted 1:200 with 1% bovine serum albumin (in PBS-T), and washed three times with PBS-T for 15 min each. Incubation with goat anti-rabbit IgG antibody conjugated with 10-nm colloidal gold particles (diluted 1:20 with PBS-T) was performed for 1 h, the grids were washed twice with PBS-T, and twice with distilled water for 15 min each. Grids were poststained in 2% uranyl acetate for 15 min, washed in distilled water, incubated in lead citrate for 5 min, washed in distilled water, air-dried, and observed with a transmission electron microscope (CEM 902 from Zeiss) operating at 80 kV. Controls were made using preimmune serum instead of anti-FeSOD antibody (13Canini A. Civitareale P. Marini S. Grilli Caiola M. Rotilio G. Planta. 1992; 187: 438-444Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar, 14Maunsbach A.B. Celis J.E. Cell Biology, A Laboratory Handbook. 3. Academic Press, San Diego1998: 249-276Google Scholar). Cloning and Overexpression of FeSOD—DNA and protein sequence of the iron-containing superoxide dismutase was obtained from the CyanoBase, the genome data base for Nostoc PCC 7120, at www.kazusa.or.jp/cyano/Anabaena/. The following oligonucleotide primers were synthesized from geneXpress (Maria Wörth, Austria): primer 1 (5′-ATA CCA TGG CAT TTG TAC AGG AAC C-3′; 25 bases containing an NcoI restriction site), and primer 2 (5′-GTG CTC GAG AGC TTT AGC ATA ATT CGC-3′; 27 bases with a XhoI restriction site). Chromosomal DNA was obtained by treating Nostoc cell pellets with SDS and heat, followed by phenol/chloroform/isoamyl alcohol extraction and ethanol wash steps (15Williams J.G.K. Methods Enzymol. 1988; 167: 766-778Crossref Scopus (850) Google Scholar). To amplify the gene for FeSOD, primers 1 and 2, chromosomal DNA from Nostoc as the template and the TaKaRa ExTaq DNA polymerase were used for PCR under the following conditions: 94 °C for 2 min (hot start); 28 cycles at 92 °C for 30 s, 50 °C for 30 s and 72 °C for 1.5 min; finally at 72 °C for 10 min. The PCR product was fractionated on a 1% agarose gel, and the appropriate DNA was cut out and purified using the GFX PCR DNA and gel band purification kit. This DNA fragment was digested with the restriction enzymes NcoI and XhoI and cloned into the NcoI- and XhoI-digested, alkaline phosphatase-treated expression vector pET-28a(+) (16Studier W.

Nicklen S. Coulson A.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1977; 74: 5463-5467Crossref PubMed Scopus (52610) Google Scholar). Competent Escherichia coli BL21(DE3) cells were transformed with the expression vector by electroporation (Gene Pulser, Bio-Rad), positive clones carrying the recombinant plasmid were selected and grown overnight on an orbital shaker (180 rpm) at 37 °C in LB medium containing 50 μg/ml kanamycin. M9ZB medium containing 50 μg/ml kanamycin and 100 μm FeSO4 was inoculated with an overnight culture, shaken at 37 °C to reach an OD600 of 1.0 and induced by the addition of 1 mm isopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside. After 4 h of incubation at 37 °C, cells were harvested by centrifugation (5000 × g, 5 min, 4 °C), frozen, and stored at –80 °C until used. Cells were resuspended in lysis buffer (50 mm Tris/HCl, pH 8.0, containing 2 mm EDTA, 0.1% Triton X-100, 1 mm PMSF, 5 μm leupeptin, and 5 μm pepstatin A) and broken by sonication with short bursts. The cell extract was centrifuged (21,000 × g, 20 min, 4 °C), and from the supernatant the superoxide dismutase was purified. Protein Purification—The supernatant was adjusted to 1 m NaCl and 20 mm imidazole and loaded on a chelating Sepharose column (1.6 × 10 cm) charged with 30 μmol of Zn2+/ml gel and equilibrated with 67 mm phosphate buffer, pH 7.0, containing 1 m NaCl and 20 mm imidazole at 4 °C. The column was washed with 200 ml of the equilibration buffer, and bound proteins were eluted with 100 ml of a gradient of 20–500 mm imidazole in 67 mm phosphate buffer, pH 7.0, containing 1 m NaCl. The eluted proteins were concentrated with Centriprep concentrators. Proteins were loaded onto a Superdex 200 column equilibrated with 67 mm phosphate buffer, pH 7.0, containing 150 mm KCl, at room temperature. Active fractions were concentrated using Centriprep concentrators, desalted with PD-10 columns, and stored frozen at –80 °C. Molecular Mass Determination—The native molecular mass was determined by gel filtration chromatography and by nondenaturing gel electrophoresis. A Superdex 200 column was equilibrated with 67 mm phosphate buffer, pH 7.0, containing 150 mm KCl, and calibrated with standards including beef liver catalase (232 kDa), bovine serum albumin (67 kDa), chicken ovalbumin (43 kDa), and bovine carboanhydrase II (29 kDa). Native discontinuous gel electrophoresis at 7, 9, 11, and 13% acrylamide was employed to measure mobility in relation to the standards also used for gel filtration, and Ferguson plots were drawn to calculate molecular mass (18Gallagher S.R. Coligan J.E. Dunn B.M. Speicher D.W. Wingfield P.T. Current Protocols in Protein Science. John Wiley & Sons, New York1995: 10.3.1-10.3.11Google Scholar). Polyacrylamide Gel Electrophoresis—SDS-PAGE was carried out on 15% slab gels as described by Laemmli (19Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (207012) Google Scholar) using SigmaMarkers and the Bio-Rad Mini-Protean II system. Proteins on the gel were stained with Coomassie Brilliant Blue. Detection of SOD activity was realized by combining native electrophoresis on 12% polyacrylamide gels with activity staining according to Beauchamp and Fridovich (20Beauchamp C. Fridovich I. Anal. Biochem. 1971; 44: 276-287Crossref PubMed Scopus (9842) Google Scholar). This assay was also performed in the presence of azide, cyanide, or hydrogen peroxide to evaluate the sensitivity of the enzyme. Isoelectric Focusing—Determination of the isoelectric point was done on 5% acrylamide gels containing Bio-Lyte ampholytes (pH 3–6 or 3–10) and using the Model 111 Mini IEF cell (Bio-Rad). Standard proteins were: amyloglucosidase (pI 3.6), trypsin inhibitor (pI 4.6), β-lactoglobulin (pI 5.1), carboanhydrase II (pI 5.9), carboanhydrase I (pI 6.6), myoglobin (pI 6.8/7.2). Spectrophotometry—Spectrophotometric measurements were made on a Zeiss Specord S10 diode array or a Hitachi U-3000 spectrophotometer, both equipped with a thermostatted cell holder. Activity Assay—SOD activity was determined by the ferricytochrome c assay (21McCord J.M. Fridovich I. J. Biol. Chem. 1969; 244: 6049-6055Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), where xanthine and xanthine oxidase was used as the source of superoxide radicals and cytochrome c as the indicating scavenger of the radical. The assay mixture (3.0 ml) contained 50 mm phosphate buffer (pH 7.8), 0.1 mm EDTA, 50 μm xanthine, 20 μm cytochrome c, and 50 μl of buffer or sample solution of several dilutions. The absorbance at 550 nm was monitored with a spectrophotometer after the addition of 50 μl of a solution containing 0.2 units/ml xanthine oxidase and thermostatted at 25 °C. Under these conditions the reduction rate of cytochrome c was 0.0004 absorbance units per second in absence of SOD which corresponds to 2.1 nm s–1 cytochrome c reduced by one electron transfer from superoxide and is proportional to the superoxide concentration. SOD reduces the cytochrome c reduction rate, and a linear plot of reciprocal absorbance change per second versus protein concentration was used for computation of specific activity. One unit of SOD was defined as the amount of enzyme that inhibits the rate of cytochrome c reduction by 50% at pH 7.8 and 25 °C, calculated from the initial rate of reaction. Determination of Protein Concentration—From cell extracts and partially purified SOD, the concentration was measured by the Coomassie Blue protein assay at 595 nm utilizing bovine serum albumin as a standard (22Bradford M.M. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 72: 248-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (215632) Google Scholar). The concentration of purified enzyme solutions was determined spectrophotometrically using the calculated molar absorbance coefficient ϵ280 = 46,410 m–1 cm–1 per subunit (23Pace C.N. Vajdos F. Fee L. Grimsley G. Gray T. Protein Sci. 1995; 4: 2411-2423Crossref PubMed Scopus (3436) Google Scholar). Sodium Azide Binding—The binding of azide to FeSOD was followed spectrophotometrically by increasing the NaN3 concentration by stepwise addition of 5 μl of 0.2–5 M NaN3 stock solutions to 1 ml of 100 μm FeSOD in 100 mm phosphate buffer, pH 7, and recording the spectrum. Stopped Flow Measurements—To follow the reaction of superoxide and SOD the model SX-18MV stopped flow spectrophotometer from Applied Photophysics equipped with a 1-cm observation cell at room temperature was used. Calculation of kinetic parameters from experimental traces was performed with the SpectraKinetic work station v4.38 interfaced to the instrument. The superoxide solution was prepared in a glove box; 133 mg of potassium superoxide and 800 mg of 18-crown-6-ether were dissolved in 6.7 ml of dimethyl sulfoxide (Me2SO), 3.3 ml dimethylformamide (DMF) and filtered. Both aprotic organic solvents were dried over a 3-Å molecular sieve. The sequential-mixing mode was utilized to follow the decrease of superoxide concentration. In the first step superoxide solution was mixed with 5 mm buffer at pH 10. After a delay time of 10 ms, this mixture was combined with buffer at pH 7–10 with or without the enzyme. The following molar absorbance coefficients were used for recording of the superoxide decay (wavelength is shown in parentheses): 2250 m–1 cm–1 (245 nm) and 284 m–1 cm–1 (300 nm) (24Bull C. Fee J.A. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1985; 107: 3295-3304Crossref Scopus (163) Google Scholar). Prior to data collection for superoxide decay, several shots of the buffer with Me2SO/DMF mixture were used to determine the baseline. All stopped flow determinations were measured in 50 mm of final buffer concentration at various pH values between pH 7 and 10, containing 100 μm EDTA, and at least three determinations were performed per substrate and enzyme concentration. Sequence Analysis—The amino acid sequences used in this work were extracted from the protein entries in the Entrez Protein search and retrieval system of NCBI (at www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov:80/entrez/query.fcgi?db=Protein), which includes data from SwissProt, PIR, PRF, PDB, GenBank™, and RefSeq. Multiple sequence alignment was performed using ClustalX (25Jeanmougin F. Thompson J.D. Gouy M. Higgins M. Gibson T.J. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1998; 23: 403-405Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2382) Google Scholar) and the following parameters: gap opening 10.0, gap extension 0.05 and the BLOSUM protein weight matrices. Phylogenetic analysis was performed using ClustalX, version 1.81, and the Bootstrap Neighbor Joining Tree option (25Jeanmougin F. Thompson J.D. Gouy M. Higgins M. Gibson T.J. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1998; 23: 403-405Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2382) Google Scholar). Detection of Superoxide Dismutase Activity in Nostoc PCC 7120 —To search for enzymes that are able to destroy the superoxide radical anion, cultures of the filamentous cyanobacterium Nostoc PCC 7120 were grown under photoautotrophic conditions. Cells were broken, and one part was separated into a cytosolic and a membrane fraction. Because cyanobacteria possess two types of membrane, the membrane component was further separated into cytoplasmic and thylakoid membranes by density gradient centrifugation. The four cell extracts (whole cell extract, cytosol, cytoplasmic membranes, and thylakoids) were used for SOD activity assays and native gel electrophoresis combined with SOD-specific staining. Membrane-containing extracts were solubilized in 2% dodecyl maltoside before application to the native gel. After the electrophoretic run SOD staining of whole cell extracts showed two bands, which were interpreted as an indication of the presence of two different types of SOD (Fig. 1, lane 1). Separation of cytosol and membranes showed that the upper band is only present in membranes and the lower band only in the soluble cytosolic fraction (Fig. 1, lane 2). To determine the type of SOD, gels with electrophoresed whole cell extracts were incubated with 50 mm NaCN or 10 mm H2O2. Both bands were present with cyanide, indicating that they do not represent CuZnSOD, which is inhibited by cyanide. Hydrogen peroxide can be used to distinguish FeSOD and MnSOD because only FeSOD is inactivated by this reagent. With hydrogen peroxide, only the lower band disappeared. Therefore the upper band should be an MnSOD (bound to the membrane) and the lower band should be an FeSOD (within the cytosol). Quantitative measurements using the ferrocytochrome c assay gave the following values (specific activities in units per mg protein in parenthesis): cytosolic fraction (15.5 ± 2), cytoplasmic membrane (3.1 ± 0.5), and thylakoids (2.0 ± 0.7). The next step was to show the presence and distribution of SODs in heterocysts. Therefore Nostoc PCC 7120 was grown in nitrogen-depleted medium and heterocysts were selectively separated from vegetative cells and broken. Whole heterocyst extracts also gave two bands at the same positions as vegetative cells in the native gel after SOD staining. Quantitative measurements using the ferrocytochrome c assay showed the following values (specific activities in units per mg protein in parenthesis): cytosolic fraction (9.3 ± 0.2), crude membranes (thylakoid and cytoplasmic membrane) (8.1 ± 0.5). Results for vegetative cells and heterocysts are summarized in Table I.Table ISuperoxide dismutase activities in cell extracts of vegetative cells and heterocysts of Anabaena PCC 7120Vegetative cellsHeterocystsCytosolCMICMCytosolCM + ICMStain on gel+++++Type of SODFeSODMnSODMnSODFeSODMnSODSpec.act.aSpec.act., specific activity in units per mg of protein determined with the ferrocytochrome c assay and using xanthine/xanthine oxidase as the superoxide radical-generating system.15.53.12.09.38.1a Spec.act., specific activity in units per mg of protein determined with the ferrocytochrome c assay and using xanthine/xanthine oxidase as the superoxide radical-generating system. Open table in a new tab Localization of FeSOD in Nostoc PCC 7120 Cells by Immunogold Labeling—To determine the distribution of FeSOD in vegetative cells and heterocysts, an antibody raised against the Anabaena cylindrica FeSOD was used (13Canini A.

https://openalex.org/W2024073408,"The two closely related bacteria Bradyrhizobium and Rhodopseudomonas palustris show an unusual mechanism of regulation of photosystem formation by light thanks to a bacteriophytochrome that antirepresses the regulator PpsR. In these two bacteria, we found out, unexpectedly, that two ppsR genes are present. We show that the two Bradyrhizobium PpsR proteins exert antagonistic effects in the regulation of photosystem formation with a classical repressor role for PpsR2 and an unexpected activator role for PpsR1. DNase I footprint analysis show that both PpsR bind to the same DNA TGTN12ACA motif that is present in tandem in the bchC promoter and the crtED intergenic region. Interestingly, the cycA and aerR promoter regions that contain only one conserved palindrome are recognized by PpsR2, but not PpsR1. Further biochemical analyses indicate that PpsR1 only is redox sensitive through the formation of an intermolecular disulfide bond, which changes its oligomerization state from a tetramer to an octamer under oxidizing conditions. Moreover, PpsR1 presents a higher DNA affinity under its reduced form in contrast to what has been previously found for PpsR or its homolog CrtJ from the Rhodobacter species. These results suggest that regulation of photosystem synthesis in Bradyrhizobium involves two PpsR competing for the binding to the same photosynthesis genes and this competition might be modulated by two factors: light via the antagonistic action of a bacteriophytochrome on PpsR2 and redox potential via the switch of PpsR1 oligomerization state.

In anoxygenic photosynthetic bacteria, the conversion of light energy into chemical energy requires several specialized membranous complexes, the light-harvesting complexes, the photosynthetic reaction center, and the cytochrome bc1 complex. After absorption of light by the bacteriochlorophyll and carotenoid molecules associated with the light harvesting complexes, the energy is transferred to the reaction center where a charge separation occurs, leading to an electron transfer that generates a transmembrane proton-motive force ultimately used for ATP synthesis. The synthesis of this photosynthetic apparatus is highly regulated in response to oxygen tension and light intensity (for reviews, see Refs. 1Oh J.I. Kaplan S. Mol. Microbiol. 2001; 39: 1116-1123Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 2Bauer C.E. Elsen S. Swem L.R. Swem D.L. Masuda S. Philos. Trans. R. Soc. Lond. B Biol.

Under aerobic conditions, the expression of photosynthesis genes is low, and the bacteria develop by drawing on the energy derived from aerobic respiration, whereas under semiaerobic or anaerobic conditions and in the light, the photosynthetic apparatus is synthesized in large amounts permitting growth by utilization of light energy.The genes necessary for the formation of the photosynthetic apparatus are clustered in a 45-kb region designated as the photosynthesis gene cluster (PGC). 1The abbreviations used are: PGC, photosynthesis gene cluster; DTT, dithiothreitol; TMPD, N,N,N′,N′-tetramethylphenylenediamine dihydrochloride; BrBphP, Bradyrhizobium bacteriophytochrome photoreceptor; Rps., Rhodopseudomonas.1The abbreviations used are: PGC, photosynthesis gene cluster; DTT, dithiothreitol; TMPD, N,N,N′,N′-tetramethylphenylenediamine dihydrochloride; BrBphP, Bradyrhizobium bacteriophytochrome photoreceptor; Rps., Rhodopseudomonas. The PGC includes several operons involved in 1) the photopigment synthesis (bacteriochlorophyll (bch), and carotenoid (crt)); 2) the light-harvesting polypeptides (pucBAC and pufBA); 3) the reaction center subunits (puhA, pufLM); and 4) various regulators (ppsR, tspO, and aerR) (4Alberti M.

Kaplan S. Nucleic Acids Res. 2000; 28: 862-867Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). The fine control of photosystem synthesis by oxygen relies on the combined action of several transcription factors that activate or repress the expression of photosynthesis genes in response to redox conditions (2Bauer C.E. Elsen S. Swem L.R. Swem D.L. Masuda S. Philos. Trans. R. Soc. Lond. B Biol. Sci. 2003; 358: 147-154Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar, 6Gregor J. Klug G. FEMS Microbiol. Lett. 1999; 179: 1-9Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). One well characterized regulator is the aerobic repressor PpsR in Rhodobacter sphaeroides or its homolog CrtJ in Rhodobacter capsulatus (7Penfold R.J. Pemberton J.M. J. Bacteriol. 1994; 176: 2869-2876Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 8Gomelsky M. Kaplan S. J. Bacteriol. 1995; 177: 1634-1637Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Both proteins share the same mode of action: under oxidizing conditions, PpsR/CrtJ blocks transcription by binding as a tetramer to a palindromic (TGTN12ACA) motif, which is found in tandem in the bch, crt, and puc promoters (9Ponnampalam S.N.

Bacteriol. 2000; 182: 2253-2261Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). In addition, biochemical studies have recently shown that CrtJ/PpsR have redox sensing capabilities thanks to the formation of an intramolecular disulfide bond promoted by oxygen, which stimulates their binding to target promoters (12Masuda S. Dong C. Swem D. Setterdahl A.T. Knaff D.B. Bauer C.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 7078-7083Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar, 13Masuda S. Bauer C.E. Cell. 2002; 110: 613-623Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (342) Google Scholar).Light intensity also controls the expression of photosynthesis genes with repressive effects less drastic than oxygen. The molecular mechanism of this regulation, described in R. sphaeroides, implicates the antagonistic actions of the repressor PpsR and the flavoprotein AppA (14Braatsch S. Gomelsky M. Kuphal S. Klug G. Mol. Microbiol. 2002; 45: 827-836Crossref PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar). Masuda and Bauer (13Masuda S. Bauer C.E. Cell. 2002; 110: 613-623Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (342) Google Scholar) have recently shown that AppA is a blue light photoreceptor that modulates the DNA binding activity of PpsR in response to oxygen and light signals, using two distinct mechanisms: it may break the disulfide bond in oxidized PpsR, or form an inactive AppA-PpsR2 complex.A new type of light regulation has been described for the two closely related species Bradyrhizobium strain ORS278 and Rhodopseudomonas palustris (15Giraud E. Fardoux J. Fourrier N. Hannibal L. Genty B. Bouyer P. Dreyfus B. Verméglio A. Nature. 2002; 417: 202-205Crossref PubMed Scopus (171) Google Scholar). In these two bacteria, depending on the oxygen tension, far-red light is necessary to trigger the expression of photosynthesis genes. The mechanism of this light regulation has been partially elucidated and involves a bacteriophytochrome. This chromoprotein exerts its regulatory activity by switching between a red light absorbing form (Pr) and a far-red light absorbing form (Pfr) (16Quail P.H. Boylan B.T. Parks B.M. Short T.W. Xu Y. Wagner D. Science. 1995; 268: 675-680Crossref PubMed Scopus (650) Google Scholar). It is noteworthy that the bacteriophytochrome genes (bphP) responsible for this regulation are found in the PGC region contiguous to a ppsR gene in both bacteria. Mutation in bphP of Bradyrhizobium strain ORS278 results in the absence of photosystem formation irrespective of the light conditions, whereas mutation in ppsR leads to the opposite phenotype. Based on phenotypes of these bphP and ppsR mutants and the action spectrum of the photosystem synthesis, it was proposed that the Pr form of the bacteriophytochrome antagonizes the repressive effect of PpsR. More recently, similar results have been obtained for Rps. palustris strain CEA001 (17Giraud E. Zappa S. Jaubert M. Hannibal L. Fardoux J. Adriano J.M. Bouyer P. Genty B. Pignol D. Verméglio A. Photochem. Photobiol. Sci. 2004; 3: 587-591Crossref PubMed Google Scholar).In this study, we reveal the presence of a second ppsR gene linked to the PGC of Bradyrhizobium strain ORS278. Examination of the genome sequence of Rps. palustris (available at http://spider.jgi-psf.org/JGI-microbial/html/) also reveals the presence of a second ppsR gene located in the PGC region. The unexpected presence of two ppsR genes in the same bacterium raises several questions. Why two different PpsR? Do both of them exert the same repressive effect as usually observed in purple bacteria? On the same photosynthesis genes? Are both PpsR involved in redox and light regulation circuit? Here, we specify the roles and the mechanisms of action of both PpsR from Bradyrhizobium, by combining genetic and biochemical approaches.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESBacterial Strains and Growth Conditions—Bradyrhizobium strain ORS278 (wild type strain) and isogenic mutants were grown in a modified YM-agar medium with addition of appropriate antibiotics when required (18Giraud E. Hannibal L. Fardoux J. Verméglio A. Dreyfus B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 14795-14800Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). All the strains were grown at 35 °C for 7 days under either semiaerobic (Petri dishes filled at 40% with YM medium and sealed with a double adhesive tape) or aerobic conditions (Petri dishes with ventilated ergot). Illumination of the cultures was provided by light emitting diodes of different wavelengths between 590 and 870 nm with an irradiance of 6.6 μmol of photons/m2/s. Escherichia coli was grown in Luria-Bertani (LB) medium supplemented with the appropriate antibiotics.Determination of Photosynthetic Activity—The amount of the photosynthetic apparatus in intact cells was estimated as previously described (18Giraud E. Hannibal L. Fardoux J. Verméglio A. Dreyfus B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 14795-14800Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar).Construction of ppsR1, ppsR2, and ppsR2/BrbphP Mutant Strains— Construction of the ppsR2 mutant has been previously described (15Giraud E. Fardoux J. Fourrier N. Hannibal L. Genty B. Bouyer P. Dreyfus B. Verméglio A. Nature. 2002; 417: 202-205Crossref PubMed Scopus (171) Google Scholar). For the construction of a ppsR1 mutant, a region of about 2.3 kb containing the ppsR1 gene was amplified by PCR using the primers 5′-TCAGGATCCTGACCGAACGGCGATAGCTTTAG-3′ and 5′-ATCG-GATCCTGCGCCGGACGGCCCCACACAATGAG-3′ and subsequently cloned in the pGEM-T vector (Promega, Madison, WI). The 4.7-kb BamHI lacZ-Kmr cassette of pKOK5 (19Kokotek W. Lotz W. Gene (Amst.). 1989; 84: 67-471Crossref Scopus (157) Google Scholar) was then inserted in the unique BglII site of ppsR1. The resulting 7-kb BamHI insert containing the mutated ppsR1 gene was cloned into the pJQ200mp18 suicide vector linearized by BamHI digestion (20Quandt J. Hynes M.F. Gene (Amst.). 1993; 127: 15-21Crossref PubMed Scopus (828) Google Scholar). For the construction of the double mutant ppsR2/BrbphP, a region of about 5 kb containing the contiguous ppsR2 and BrbphP genes was amplified by PCR using the primers 5′-TGCGGATCCGCACCCCGTCCTGTGCCAGCGTATC-3′ and 5′-TAGGGATCCATAACCACCGCCGCCTGTGATGATAAAAC-3′ and subsequently cloned into the pGEM-T vector. A 3.2-kb region containing a part of the ppsR2 and BrbphP genes was deleted by XhoI digestion and replaced by the 4.7-kb SalI lacZ-Kmr cassette of pKOK5. The resulting 6.6-kb BamHI insert containing the mutated ppsR2 and Brb-phP genes was cloned into the pJQ200mp18 suicide vector linearized by BamHI digestion. The pJQ200 derivatives obtained, which encoded a counter selective sacB marker, were transformed into E. coli S17-1 for mobilization into ORS278 as previously described (18Giraud E. Hannibal L. Fardoux J. Verméglio A. Dreyfus B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 14795-14800Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). Double recombinants were selected on sucrose and the insertion was confirmed by PCR.β-Galactosidase Assay—For analysis of ppsR1 and ppsR2 expression, β-galactosidase activity was assayed as previously described (15Giraud E. Fardoux J. Fourrier N. Hannibal L. Genty B. Bouyer P. Dreyfus B. Verméglio A. Nature. 2002; 417: 202-205Crossref PubMed Scopus (171) Google Scholar).Cloning, Protein Expression, and Purification—The ppsR1 and ppsR2 genes from Bradyrhizobium strain ORS278 were amplified by PCR using Pfu DNA polymerase and the following pairs of primers: PpsR1.pBAD.f, 5′-GGATCCGTGAGGGCGTTCAGAGCTCCGAAAGA-G-3′ and PpsR1.pBAD.r, 5′-AAGCTTCTATTCCAACTGACTGTCTTCT-TCGCTTG-3′; PpsR2.pBAD.f, 5′-ATGGATCCATGGCCGAGTTTCAC-GGTCCACGA-3′ and PpsR2.pBAD.r, 5′-ATGGATCCCTAGCTCCCCT-TTTCGGTTTCCT-3′. The PCR products were digested (BamHI/HindIII for ppsR1; BamHI for ppsR2) and ligated into the expression vector pBAD/HisB (Invitrogen). The recombinant PpsR proteins were overexpressed in E. coli LMG194 (Invitrogen) by induction with l-arabinose as previously described (17Giraud E. Zappa S. Jaubert M. Hannibal L. Fardoux J. Adriano J.M. Bouyer P. Genty B. Pignol D. Verméglio A. Photochem. Photobiol. Sci. 2004; 3: 587-591Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Purification of His6-appended PpsR proteins was performed using nickel chelate affinity chromatography as described (17Giraud E. Zappa S. Jaubert M. Hannibal L. Fardoux J. Adriano J.M. Bouyer P. Genty B. Pignol D. Verméglio A. Photochem. Photobiol. Sci. 2004; 3: 587-591Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The purified protein were quantified using the Bradford assay (Bio-Rad) and then aliquoted and stored at –80 °C in the presence of 20% (v/v) glycerol.Reduction and oxidation of both PpsR were tested using various reagents: 10 mm dithiothreitol (DTT), 0.1 and 1 mm H2O2, 0.5 and 5 mm K3Fe(CN)6 (potassium ferricyanide), or a mixture of 0.5 and 5 mm K3Fe(CN)6 with 10 μm TMPD (N,N,N′,N′-tetramethylphenylenediamine dihydrochloride) diluted in water, and air by exposing the sample to a constant flow of air gas during 3 h. After addition of the oxidizing or reducing reagents, the proteins were incubated overnight on ice and subsequently analyzed by nonreducing SDS-PAGE and gel filtration chromatography, or used for DNase I footprint experiments.Site-directed Mutagenesis—Single mutations were introduced in PpsR1 and PpsR2 amino acid sequences using the QuikChange™ site-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene) according to the manufacturer's recommendations. To construct the PpsR1-C429S mutant, the plasmid pBAD::ppsR1 was used as a template with the following primers: PpsR1-C429S sense (5′-GTGATCGAGCGGATGTCGATCGAGACCGC-GCTC-3′) and PpsR1-C429S antisense (5′-GAGCGCGGTCTCGATCG-ACATCCGCTCGATCAC-3′). The Y407C mutation on the PpsR2 sequence was generated using the plasmid pBAD::ppsR2 as a template and the primers PpsR2-Y407C sense (5′-GTCGAGCAGCATTGTGTCC-GCGCCGCG-3′) and PpsR2-Y407C antisense (5′-CGCGGCGCGG-ACACAATGCTGCTCGAC-3′).DNase I Footprint Analysis—Four probes corresponding to the promoter regions of bchC, crtE, aerR, and cycA were used for studying the DNA binding of PpsR1 and PpsR2. Probes were prepared by PCR using 32P5′-end labeled oligonucleotide primers, as previously described (17Giraud E. Zappa S. Jaubert M. Hannibal L. Fardoux J. Adriano J.M. Bouyer P. Genty B. Pignol D. Verméglio A. Photochem. Photobiol. Sci. 2004; 3: 587-591Crossref PubMed Google Scholar).The bchC promoter region was obtained using the primers: 5′-CTC-GAGGATCCGCGGAATTCAAGCTTCTACGACGACCCGCTGCCTA-C-3′ and 5′-CTCGAGGATCCGCGGAATTCAAGCTTCTACGACGACC-CGCTGCCTAC-3′; the crtE promoter region was obtained using the primers: 5′-GCCGATTGCGATCTGGCGCATCTTG-3′ and 5′-AGGGA-TTTTTCGATCCGGGCCATCAC-3′; the cycA promoter region was obtained using the primers: 5′-GAGAGTCTTGAGAATGTCGTTAG-3′ and 5′-GTCGCCGCCGTCCAGCGCGAATG-3′; the aerR promoter region was obtained using the primers: 5′-CGGGCACGCACTCGGGGA-TTTG-3′ and 5′-TGTCGCGCCGGCGCTTTTCCTC-3′. DNase I footprint experiments were performed as previously described (17Giraud E. Zappa S. Jaubert M. Hannibal L. Fardoux J. Adriano J.M. Bouyer P. Genty B. Pignol D. Verméglio A. Photochem. Photobiol. Sci. 2004; 3: 587-591Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). PpsR1, PpsR1-C429S, or PpsR2 DNA binding isotherms to the bchC promoter were generated by DNase I titration assays using different protein dilutions treated by 10 mm DTT or a mixture of 0.5 mm K3Fe(CN)6 with 10 μm TMPD. The gel was then analyzed for PpsR binding isotherms using a PhosphorImager (Storm, Amersham Biosciences) to quantify the level of PpsR protection of a single band in the upstream and downstream palindromes. Values were corrected for loading by normalization with a band from an unprotected region.Gel Filtration Chromatography—The oligomerization states of PpsR1 and PpsR2 were estimated by gel filtration chromatography. The Superdex 200 26/60 column (Amersham Biosciences) was equilibrated with 20 mm HEPES (pH 8.5), 50 mm NaCl in the presence of either 1 mm DTT or 1 mm K3Fe(CN)6. Before injection of the samples, the purified proteins were previously incubated under different redox conditions as described above. Each experiment was carried out in duplicate. The column was previously size calibrated using commercial gel filtration standards (Amersham Biosciences).RESULTSppsR1 and ppsR2: Identification and Sequence Analysis—We have previously isolated the PGC region of Bradyrhizobium strain ORS278 and revealed the presence of a ppsR gene contiguous to a bacteriophytochrome gene named BrbphP. The sequencing of the downstream region revealed the presence of a second ppsR gene located around 5 kb from the first one (Fig. 1A). Examination of the PGC region of Rps. palustris also revealed the presence of two ppsR genes, one of them being also contiguous to a bacteriophytochrome gene (Fig. 1A). In the genome annotation of Rps. palustris, the ppsR gene contiguous to bphP is named ppsR2 and the other one is called ppsR1. As the gene organization is similar in both bacteria, we propose to use the same nomenclature for Bradyrhizobium and Rps. palustris. Interestingly PpsR1 and PpsR2 from both bacteria show a relatively weak amino acid sequence identity (32% between the two PpsR identified in Bradyrhizobium and 33% between PpsR1 and PpsR2 from Rps. palustris). It is noteworthy that a stronger similarity is observed between the two PpsR1 (54% of identity) and the two PpsR2 (44%). Furthermore, phylogenetic analysis using the available PpsR or CrtJ sequences clearly shows that the two PpsR1 and the two PpsR2 belong to two distinct clusters (Fig. 1B). These data suggest functional relationships between the two PpsR1 and between the two PpsR2 identified in Bradyrhizobium ORS278 and Rps. palustris.Despite their low sequence similarity, PpsR1 and PpsR2 of both organisms present a similar architecture to the one predicted for Rhodobacter PpsR/CrtJ (11Gomelsky M. Horne I.M. Lee H. Pemberton J.M. McEwan A.G. Kaplan S. J. Bacteriol. 2000; 182: 2253-2261Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar), with the presence of two PAS domains and a helix-turn-helix DNA binding motif at the carboxyl-terminal region. One significant feature of both PpsR2 sequences is the absence of the Cys residue. In contrast, the PpsR1 of Bradyrhizobium strain ORS278 contains only one Cys residue, whereas three are present in the PpsR1 of Rps. palustris. The absence of the Cys residue in both PpsR2 strongly suggests a mode of action different from the “classical” one described in Rhodobacter species.Role of PpsR1 and PpsR2 in Bradyrhizobium Strain ORS278—To specify the role of PpsR1 and PpsR2 identified in Bradyrhizobium strain ORS278, we constructed isogenic mutants (278ΔppsR1, 278ΔppsR2) and compared their photosynthetic phenotypes to the wild type strain after growth under different light and oxygen conditions.The synthesis of the photosynthetic apparatus is highly enhanced by far-red light when the WT strain is grown under semiaerobic conditions (Fig. 2A). When the oxygen tension is increased (aerobic conditions), the stimulatory effect of far red light is not observed anymore (Fig. 2B) and the photosystem synthesis remains very low irrespective of the light conditions. This suggests that oxygen exerts a repressive effect that dominates the activation by far-red light.Fig. 2Effect of illumination on photosynthetic activity of Bradyrhizobium ORS278 wild type strain and mutants 278ΔppsR1 and 278ΔppsR2. A, under semiaerobic conditions. B, under aerobic conditions. C, image of the long-wavelength fluorescence emission of the bacteriochlorophyll of the 278ΔppsR2 mutant cultivated under aerobic conditions in the presence of light of different wavelengths (see “Experimental Procedures”). D, wavelength dependence of photosystem synthesis of the 278ΔppsR2 mutant cultivated in aerobic conditions. The data represent the mean of three experiments (error bars indicate ± S.D.)View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT)In contrast with the WT strain, we previously observed that the 278ΔppsR2 mutant constitutively synthesized the photosystem under semiaerobiosis irrespective of the light conditions (Fig. 2A). We therefore concluded that PpsR2 acts as a repressor and that far-red light antagonizes its repressive effect under semiaerobic conditions via the action of the bacteriophytochrome BrBphP (15Giraud E. Fardoux J. Fourrier N. Hannibal L. Genty B. Bouyer P. Dreyfus B. Verméglio A. Nature. 2002; 417: 202-205Crossref PubMed Scopus (171) Google Scholar). Under aerobic conditions, the phenotype of the 278ΔppsR2 mutant is puzzling. Indeed, we observed that the synthesis of the photosystem is high in darkness and low under far-red light illumination (Fig. 2B). To specify the nature of the pigment involved in this light inhibition, we cultivated the 278ΔppsR2 mutant in aerobiosis under a series of light-emitting diodes of different wavelengths (between 590 and 870 nm). Bacteriochlorophyll fluorescence was used as a specific marker of the presence of the photosynthetic apparatus (Fig. 2C). We observed a clear negative effect of light in the 700–770 nm region, with a maximum close to 750 nm (Fig. 2D). The action spectrum of this repressive effect of light under aerobic conditions is very similar to the absorption of the Pfr form of a bacteriophytochrome. To test whether this effect of light under aerobic conditions was controlled by BrBphP, we constructed a PpsR2 and BrBphP double mutant. The same repressive effect of far red light was observed in this mutant (data not shown) demonstrating that BrBphP is not involved in this light inhibition. Therefore, a second bacteriophytochrome is likely involved in this light regulatory circuit. Such an hypothesis makes sense because sequence analysis of the closely related Rps. palustris genome revealed the presence of 6 genes encoding putative bacteriophytochromes, four of them being located close to photosynthesis genes (21Larimer F.W. Chain P. Hauser L. Lamerdin J. Malfatti S. Do L. Land M.L. Pelletier D.A. Beatty J.T. Lang A.S. Tabita F.R. Gibson J.L. Hanson T.E. Bobst C. Torres y Torres J.L. Peres C. Harrison F.H. Gibson J. Harwood C.S. Nat. Biotechnol. 2004; 22: 55-61Crossref PubMed Scopus (551) Google Scholar).The phenotype of the 278ΔppsR1 mutant was also unexpected as we observed a very low photosystem synthesis whatever the light and oxygen conditions (Fig. 2, A and B). This clearly shows that contrary to PpsR2 and PpsR/CrtJ of the Rhodobacter species, PpsR1 is an activator of transcription that plays a key role because its presence appears essential for the synthesis of the photosynthetic apparatus in Bradyrhizobium.Oligomerization States of PpsR1 and PpsR2 in Response to Redox Conditions—The His-tagged versions of both PpsR were successfully overexpressed in E. coli LMG194 using the pBAD-HisB vector. They were subsequently isolated to a high level of purity (>95% as judged by Coomassie Blue staining) (Fig. 3, A and B) by affinity binding of the His6 tag to a Ni2+ column.Fig. 3Redox dependence of PpsR1 and PpsR2. SDS-PAGE analysis of PpsR after reduction or oxidation using various reagents. A, PpsR2. B, PpsR1.

The estimated position of elution of native PpsR1, PpsR2, and PpsR1-C429S are shown after reduced (E) or oxidized (F) treatments.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT)PpsR/CrtJ from Rhodobacter species were shown to be redox sensitive via the formation of an intramolecular disulfide bond between two conserved cysteine residues, which modulates the DNA binding affinity (12Masuda S.

Cell. 2002; 110: 613-623Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (342) Google Scholar). The absence of the Cys residue in PpsR2 as well as the presence of a unique Cys residue in PpsR1 suggest fundamental differences in their response to redox conditions. To assess this hypothesis, the purified proteins were incubated overnight at 4 °C under various oxidizing or reducing conditions and subsequently analyzed by SDS-PAGE under non-reducing conditions. As expected from the sequence analysis, the variation of the redox potential does not influence the oligomerization state of PpsR2. Indeed, a single band around 50 kDa, corresponding to its calculated molecular mass, is observed whatever the redox conditions (Fig. 3A). In contrast, the oligomerization state of PpsR1 depends on the redox conditions. Under reducing conditions, PpsR1 migrates as a monomer (Fig. 3B, lane a), whereas in appropriate oxidizing conditions, an additional band corresponding to a protein of 100 kDa is revealed (Fig. 3B, lanes e, h, and i). This molecular mass corresponds to a dimer of PpsR1, suggesting that oxidizing conditions lead to the formation of an intermolecular disulfide bond. Contrary to CrtJ or PpsR, which are oxidized after 5 min of air exposure (9Ponnampalam S.N. Bauer C.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 18391-18396Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar, 13Masuda S. Bauer C.E. Cell. 2002; 110: 613-623Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (342) Google Scholar), PpsR1 remains reduced even after several hours of aeration (Fig. 3B, lane c). The maximal effect on the PpsR1 oligomerization state was only reached when ferricyanide was added in the presence of TMPD (a mediator that facilitates the equilibrium of electrons from the oxidizing reagent to the protein) (see Fig. 3B, lanes h and i). About equal amounts of protein were present in the bands of 50 and 100 kDa when PpsR1 had been incubated with 0.5 mm ferricyanide + TMPD. Higher concentrations of ferricyanide and TMPD up to 10 mm did not increase this ratio. This result suggests that the quaternary structure of the fully oxidized form of PpsR1 corresponds to a complex in which half"

We probed the molecular and biophysical mechanisms of this modulation using mutagenesis, biochemistry, and both whole-cell and single channel modes of patch clamp recording. Immunoprecipitation assays showed that Src associates with KCNQ2–5 subunits but phosphorylates only KCNQ3–5. Using KCNQ3 as a background, we found that mutation of a tyrosine in the amino terminus (Tyr-67) or one in the carboxyl terminus (Tyr-349) abolished Src-dependent modulation of heterologously expressed KCNQ2/3 heteromultimers. The tyrosine phosphorylation was much weaker for either the KCNQ3-Y67F or KCNQ3-Y349F mutants and wholly absent in the KCNQ3-Y67F/Y349F double mutant. Biotinylation assays showed that Src activity does not alter the membrane abundance of channels in the plasma membrane. In recordings from cell-attached patches containing a single KCNQ2/3 channel, we found that Src inhibits the open probability of the channels. Kinetic analysis was consistent with the channels having two discrete open times and three closed times. Src activity reduced the durations of the longest open time and lengthened the longest closed time of the channels. The implications for the mechanisms of channel regulation by the dual phosphorylations on both channel termini are discussed.

Regulation of neuronal activity by tyrosine kinases has emerged as an important theme in neurobiology. In addition to their well documented role in neuronal proliferation and trophic responses are actions on several different types of ion channels that link alterations in electrical activity to neuronal plasticity. Examples are non-receptor tyrosine kinase modulation of Shaker family K+ channels (1Fadool D.A. Holmes T.C. Berman K. Dagan D. Levitan I.B. J.

Compared with other Kv channels, KCNQ channels have an extended intracellular carboxyl terminus that seems to be the target of many modulatory signals. Examples are modulation by Ca2+ (18Selyanko A.A. Brown D.A. Neuron. 1996; 16: 151-162Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar), using calmodulin as the channel Ca2+ sensor (19Gamper N. Shapiro M.S. J. Gen.

Src is the prototypical member of the family of non-receptor tyrosine kinases that also includes Fyn, Hck, Lck, and Yes. These proteins often act via two mechanisms: by binding to substrate via Src homology (SH) 1The abbreviations used are: SH, Src homology; CA, constitutively active; CHO, Chinese hamster ovary; wt, wild-type; DN, dominant-negative; PIP2, phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate; pS, picosiemens; CMD, channel-modulatory domain.1The abbreviations used are: SH, Src homology; CA, constitutively active; CHO, Chinese hamster ovary; wt, wild-type; DN, dominant-negative; PIP2, phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate; pS, picosiemens; CMD, channel-modulatory domain. 2 and SH3 domains and/or by phosphorylation of target tyrosines (24Martin G.S. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 2: 467-475Crossref PubMed Scopus (489) Google Scholar). For example, distinct effects of Src actions by these two mechanisms have been described for Kv1.4 and Kv1.5 K+ channels (6Nitabach M.N. Llamas D.A. Thompson I.J. Collins K.A. Holmes T.C. J. Neurosci. 2002; 22: 7913-7922Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). We recently showed subunit-specific modulation of KCNQ channels by Src and suggested that Src action was distinct from modulation by muscarinic acetylcholine receptor stimulation (25Gamper N. Stockand J.D. Shapiro M.S. J. Neurosci. 2003; 23: 84-95Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Although we showed that tyrosine phosphorylation of a substrate is involved, we did not ascertain whether direct phosphorylation of the channels themselves is required and the location of any putative tyrosines involved. The strongest effect of Src activity in both the heterologous system involving cloned channels and sympathetic neurons is a strong voltage-independent suppression of whole-cell currents with other effects being a shift in the voltage dependence of activation and a slowing of activation kinetics (25Gamper N. Stockand J.D. Shapiro M.S. J. Neurosci. 2003; 23: 84-95Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Here we focus on the major voltage-independent effect and probe the underlying molecular and biophysical mechanism by which it occurs. The observed depression of macroscopic KCNQ currents could be a reduction of the unitary properties of the channels or a reduction of channel number in the plasma membrane. In neurons, the M current, named for its suppression by muscarinic acetylcholine receptor agonists (26Constanti A. Brown D.A. Neurosci. Lett. 1981; 24: 289-294Crossref PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar), is largely composed of KCNQ2/3 heteromultimers (11Wang H.S. Pan Z. Shi W. Brown B.S. Wymore R.S. Cohen I.S. Dixon J.E. McKinnon D.

Pharmacol. 2002; 137: 1173-1186Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar), and we predominantly focused on these channels in this work. Using a heterologous expression system and site-directed mutagenesis, we suggest that two widely separated tyrosines, one in the amino terminus and the other in the carboxyl terminus, must be phosphorylated for Src-mediated modulation. In addition, by single channel recording and biotinylation assays we show that the suppression of whole-cell KCNQ2/3 currents by Src is caused by a reduced probability of channel opening. These results provide important insights into our understanding of regulation of K+ channels by protein tyrosine kinases. In particular, they shed further light on the molecular mechanisms regulating gating of KCNQ channels. cDNA Constructs—Plasmids encoding human KCNQ2, rat KCNQ3, human KCNQ4, and human KCNQ5 (GenBank™ accession numbers AF110020, AF091247, AF105202, and AF249278, respectively) were kindly given to us by David McKinnon (State University of New York, Stony Brook, NY; KCNQ2 and KCNQ3), Thomas Jentsch (Zentrum für Molekulare Neurobiologie, Hamburg, Germany; KCNQ4), and Klaus Steinmeyer (Aventis Pharma, Frankfurt am Main, Germany; KCNQ5).

Neurosci. 2000; 20: 1710-1721Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). KCNQ4 and KCNQ5 were subcloned into pcDNA3.1zeo+ and pcDNA3.1zeo–as described previously (25Gamper N. Stockand J.D. Shapiro M.S. J. Neurosci. 2003; 23: 84-95Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Myc-tagged KCNQ2–5 were generated by subcloning each channel in-frame into cytomegalovirus-myc (pCMV) plasmid (Clontech) behind the Myc epitope. The tyrosine to phenylalanine KCNQ3 mutants were made commercially using the QuikChange mutagenesis kit (BioS&T, Montreal Canada) and were sequenced to verify mutagenesis. Rat wild-type and K298M Src were subcloned into pcDNA3.1zeo–using EcoRI. Cell Culture and Transfections—Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells were grown in 100-mm tissue culture dishes (Falcon, BD Biosciences) in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium with 10% heat-inactivated fetal bovine serum and 0.1% penicillin and streptomycin in a humidified incubator at 37 °C (5% CO2) and passaged every 3–4 days. Cells were discarded after ∼30 passages. For transfection, cells were plated onto poly-l-lysine-coated coverslip chips and transfected 24 h later with Polyfect reagent (Qiagen, Hilden, Germany) according to the instructions of the manufacturer. For electrophysiological and biochemical experiments, cells were used 48–96 h after transfection. As a marker for successfully transfected cells, cDNA encoding green fluorescent protein was co-transfected together with the cDNAs of interest. Biotinylation of Cell Surface Protein and Immunoblotting—Cells were grown in 100-mm culture dishes and individually transfected with Myc-tagged KCNQ2–5 and green fluorescent protein together with either wild-type (wt) or dominant-negative K298M rat Src (DN-Src). After 48 h, cells were washed three to five times with cold phosphate-buffered saline at room temperature (22–25 °C), and then cell surface proteins were biotinylated by EZ-link sulfo-N-hydroxysuccinimide-S-S-biotin (0.5 mg/ml, Pierce) in phosphate-buffered saline. After incubation at 4 °C for 1 h, cells were washed five times with ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline to remove any remaining biotinylation reagent. Cells were then harvested with a rubber policeman in gentle lysis buffer (GLB; 75 mm NaCl, 50 mm Tris-HCl, 2 mm EGTA, 1% Nonidet P-40, 10% glycerol) plus the protease inhibitor phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride (Sigma), and lysate proteins were quantified with a BCA assay (Pierce). Proteins (150 μg/reaction) were mixed with 50 μl of streptavidin-immobilized beads (Pierce, beads were first washed four times with GLB) overnight at 4 °C. Beads were pelleted, washed thoroughly in GLB, and incubated in Laemmli sample buffer at 50 °C for 30 min, and bound proteins were separated using SDS-PAGE followed by electroblotting onto nitrocellulose membranes. Immunoblots were probed with mouse anti-Myc primary antibodies (Clontech) at 1:1000 dilution overnight at 4 °C in a blocking solution containing 5% nonfat dry milk (Carnation) in Tris-buffered saline and Tween 20 and subsequently treated with goat anti-mouse horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibodies (1: 25,000 dilution, 45 min, room temperature; Jackson ImmunoResearch, West Grove, PA). Blots were developed with enhanced chemiluminescence (Supersignal, Pierce) and exposed on x-ray film (Biomax). Phosphotyrosine Labeling—CHO cells were grown in Ham's F-12 medium (Invitrogen) supplemented with 10% newborn calf serum and 1% penicillin/streptomycin. Transfections of CHO cells were performed in 60-mm plates with 3 μg of total recombinant plasmid using LipofectAMINE reagent according to the manufacturer's protocol (Invitrogen). Twenty-four hours after transfection, cells were lysed in 300 μl of Buffer A (50 mm HEPES, pH 7.6, 150 mm NaCl, 1% Triton X-100, 10 mm NaF, 20 mm sodium pyrophosphate, 20 mm β-glycerol phosphate, 1 mm Na+ orthovanadate, 10 μg/ml leupeptin, 10 μg/ml aprotinin, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride). The homogenate was centrifuged (14,000 × g, 4 °C, 10 min), and the supernatants were incubated with specific antibodies bound to protein G beads overnight at 4 °C with gentle rotation. After incubation, immunoprecipitates were washed extensively with ice-cold Buffer B (50 mm HEPES, pH 7.6, 150 mm NaCl, and 0.1% Triton X-100). Proteins bound to the beads were eluted by heating at 95 °C for 4 min in SDS-PAGE sample loading buffer. The eluted proteins were separated by SDS-PAGE, transferred to a nitrocellulose membrane, and detected with specific anti-phosphotyrosine, anti-Src, or anti-Myc antibodies. Whole-cell Electrophysiology—Whole-cell patch clamp experiments were performed at room temperature (22–25 °C). Pipettes were pulled from borosilicate glass capillaries (1B150F-4, World Precision Instruments) using a Flaming-Brown P-97 micropipette puller (Sutter Instruments, Novato, CA) and had resistances of 2–3 megaohms when filled with internal solution and measured in Ringer's solution. Membrane current was measured under voltage clamp with pipette and membrane capacitance cancellation, sampled at 1 kHz, and filtered at 200 Hz by an Axopatch 1-D amplifier (Axon Instruments, Union City, CA). Data acquisition and analysis were performed by PULSE software (HEKA), ITC-16 interface (Instrutech, Port Washington, NY), and IgorPro (Wavemetrics, Eugene, OR). The whole-cell access resistance was typically 4–10 megaohms. Cells were placed in a 500-μl perfusion chamber through which solution flowed at 1–2 ml/min. Inflow to the chamber was by gravity from several reservoirs, selectable by activation of solenoid valves (VaveLink 8, Automate Scientific). Bath solution exchange was complete by <30 s. To observe green fluorescent protein fluorescence, a mercury lamp was used in combination with an Eclipse TE 300 inverted microscope equipped with an HQ fluorescein isothiocyanate filter cube (Nikon, Melville, NY). To evaluate current amplitudes at saturating voltages, CHO cells were held at 0 mV, and 800-ms hyperpolarizing steps to –60 mV followed by 1-s pulses back to 0 mV were given. The amplitude of the current was usually defined as the difference between the holding current at 0 mV and the current at the beginning (after any capacity current has subsided) of the 1-s pulse back to 0 mV. All results are reported as mean ± S.E. Cell-attached Patch/Single Channel Electrophysiology—The methods of recording and analysis were similar to those used previously for studying unitary KCNQ channels (29Li Y. Gamper N. Shapiro M.S. J. Neurosci. 2004; 24: 5079-5090Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). Channel activity was recorded 48–72 h after transfection in the cell-attached configuration. Pipettes had resistances of 7–15 megaohms when filled with a solution of the following composition: 150 mm NaCl, 5 mm KCl, 2 mm CaCl2, 1 mm MgCl2, 10 mm HEPES, pH 7.4 with NaOH. Cells were bath-perfused with a solution of the following composition: 175 mm KCl, 4 mm MgCl2, 10 mm HEPES, pH 7.4 with KOH. There was no Ca2+ or Ca2+ chelator added to this solution, and we assumed free Ca2+ to be in the range of ∼50 μm. The resting membrane voltage was assumed to be 0 mV. Currents were recorded using an Axopatch 1-D amplifier (Axon Instruments), sampled at 5 kHz, and filtered at 1 kHz or 500 Hz. Data were analyzed using PulseFit and TAC (Bruxton, Seattle, WA) software. Open and closed times were analyzed by using the “50% threshold criterion.” All events were carefully checked visually before being accepted. Open and closed time histograms as well as Po were generated using TACFit (Bruxton). The presence of only one channel in a patch was assumed if Po was >0.25 for >1 min without superimposed openings especially at strongly depolarized potentials where Po is highest. At a given potential, the single channel amplitude (i) was calculated by fitting all-point histograms with single or multi-Gaussian curves. The difference between the fitted “closed” and “open” peaks was taken as i. When superimposed openings were observed, the number of channels in the patch was estimated from the maximal number of superimposed openings. Only the apparent NPo was estimated asNPo=(∑j=1Ntjj)/T(Eq. 1) where tj is the time spent at each current level corresponding to j = 0, 1, 2... N; T is the duration of the recording; and N is the number of current levels (minimum number of active channels). Sites of Action of Src on KCNQ Channels—We have previously reported that c-Src (Src) modulates both KCNQ currents from cloned channels heterologously expressed in CHO cells and endogenous M currents in rat sympathetic neurons. Src modulation is most easily observed by overexpression of Src in either system, which strongly depresses the whole-cell currents. In the heterologous system, currents from KCNQ3, KCNQ4, and KCNQ5 homomultimers and KCNQ2/3 heteromultimers, but not KCNQ1 or KCNQ2 homomultimers, are depressed by Src overexpression (25Gamper N. Stockand J.D. Shapiro M.S. J. Neurosci. 2003; 23: 84-95Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). We found that Src-dependent phosphorylation of a protein that may be the channel itself correlated with the subunit specificity of Src action and hypothesized that this is due to a subunit-specific phosphorylation of channel tyrosines. Alignment and inspection of the KCNQ1–5 amino acid sequences does not reveal conserved tyrosines among KCNQ3–5 that are not present in KCNQ1 and KCNQ2. However, there are five tyrosines conserved among KCNQ2–5 subunits that are predicted to be accessible from the intracellular side. These residues are depicted schematically in Fig. 1B. Using KCNQ3 as a background, we initially individually mutated those tyrosines to phenylalanines and assayed the effect of Src on those mutant channels. Since KCNQ3 homomultimers usually express poorly, we co-expressed KCNQ2 and either the wt or mutant KCNQ3 subunits to form KCNQ2/3 heteromultimers. We compared the amplitudes of the currents in cells only expressing the channels with those co-expressed with Src. Since KCNQ2 homomeric currents are not depressed by Src (25Gamper N. Stockand J.D. Shapiro M.S. J. Neurosci. 2003; 23: 84-95Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), we reasoned that any suppression of the currents by Src must be on the KCNQ3 subunits in the tetramer. In these experiments, we often verified that the co-expressed subunits did form heteromultimers by assaying block by tetraethylammonium ions. At 10 mm, tetraethylammonium block of KCNQ2 or KCNQ3 homomultimers is nearly total or very slight, respectively, and block of KCNQ2/3 heteromultimers is ∼60% (28Shapiro M.S. Roche J.P. Kaftan E.J. Cruzblanca H. Mackie K. Hille B. J. Neurosci. 2000; 20: 1710-1721Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 30Hadley J.K. Noda M. Selyanko A.A. Wood I.C. Abogadie F.C. Brown D.A. Br. J. Pharmacol. 2000; 129: 413-415Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar). As before, co-expression of KCNQ2 and wt KCNQ3 subunits resulted in robust currents that were greatly suppressed by overexpression of Src (Fig. 1A). For KCNQ2/wtQ3 channels, the mean current amplitude in control cells was 451 ± 92 pA, but in cells co-expressed with Src, it was reduced to 150 ± 42 pA (n = 37, 39; p < 0.005). We also observed slowing of activation kinetics as described previously (25Gamper N. Stockand J.D. Shapiro M.S. J. Neurosci. 2003; 23: 84-95Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Heteromultimers formed by co-expression of KCNQ2 and the five Tyr-to-Phe mutant KCNQ3 subunits also expressed well and yielded currents similar in amplitude to those formed by wt heteromultimers. Tetraethylammonium (10 mm) block of currents produced by co-expression of KCNQ2 and the KCNQ3 mutants ranged from 52–72%, consistent with expression of heteromeric channels. Among the five mutants, we found that co-expression of two of them with KCNQ2 resulted in currents that were not suppressed by Src co-expression. The two were Y67F, located in a highly conserved region of the amino terminus, and Y349F, located in the carboxyl terminus in the first highly conserved region just downstream of the end of the sixth transmembrane domain (S6) (Fig. 1A). For co-expression of KCNQ2/Q3-Y67F, the mean current amplitude in control cells was 264 ± 59 pA, and in cells co-expressed with Src, it was 297 ± 116 pA (n = 7, 23). For co-expression of KCNQ2/Q3-Y349F, the mean current amplitude in control cells was 294 ± 68 pA, and in cells co-expressed with Src, it was 248 ± 59 pA (n = 8, 9). Interestingly Tyr-349 is in the domain suggested to be a site for binding of phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate (PIP2) to the channels (22Zhang H. Craciun L.C. Mirshahi T. Rohacs T. Lopes C.M. Jin T. Logothetis D.E. Neuron. 2003; 37: 963-975Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (428) Google Scholar) and for calmodulin-mediated assembly (31Wen H. Levitan I.B. J. Neurosci. 2002; 22: 7991-8001Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). For the other mutants, Y88F, Y243F, and Y513F, overexpression of Src inhibited the heteromeric current in a way similar to the inhibition of currents from wt KCNQ2/3 channels (Fig. 1C). These data suggest that Src-mediated suppression of KCNQ2/3 channels might involve phosphorylation of both Tyr-67 in the amino terminus and Tyr-349 in the carboxyl terminus. Src Binds to KCNQ2–5 Subunits but Induces Subunit-specific Phosphorylation—The actions of non-receptor tyrosine kinases on effector proteins may involve binding of the kinase to the effector, its tyrosine phosphorylation by the kinase, or a combination of the two (32Hubbard S.R. Till J.H. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2000; 69: 373-398Crossref PubMed Scopus (859) Google Scholar). In the case of Shaker K+ channels, distinct effects of Src kinase have been attributed to both of these mechanisms (3Holmes T.C. Fadool D.A. Ren R. Levitan I.B. Science. 1996; 274: 2089-2091Crossref PubMed Scopus (230) Google Scholar, 6Nitabach M.N. Llamas D.A. Thompson I.J. Collins K.A. Holmes T.C. J. Neurosci. 2002; 22: 7913-7922Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Thus, we investigated whether the Src effects on KCNQ channels were due to binding of Src to the channels or to phosphorylations and, if the latter, whether direct phosphorylation of channel tyrosines are involved. To probe for binding of the kinase to the channels, we performed co-immunoprecipitation assays. KCNQ2–5 subunits were epitope-tagged by introduction of Myc epitope to their amino termini and individually expressed in CHO cells together with Src. The properties of the KCNQ2–5 channels were not affected by introduction of the Myc epitope (data not shown). Whole-cell lysates were immunoprecipitated with anti-Src antibodies, the precipitates were resolved by SDS-PAGE, and immunoblots were performed with anti-Myc antibodies. The immunoblots yielded signals for all KCNQ2–5 channels, and those signals were sharply reduced by preadsorbing the anti-Src antibodies with the immunizing peptide that was used to raise the antibodies (Fig. 2A). Similar results were seen in three such assays. Thus, we conclude that all KCNQ2–5 channels can associate with Src kinase either via some intermediary adaptor protein or by directly binding to the channels. Although these data suggest that Src can associate with KCNQ2, homomeric KCNQ2 currents are not suppressed by Src overexpression (25Gamper N. Stockand J.D. Shapiro M.S. J. Neurosci. 2003; 23: 84-95Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), indicating that association with channels is not sufficient for Src-mediated modulation of whole-cell currents. We then asked whether the channels are directly phosphorylated by Src kinase using another immunoprecipitation assay. In these experiments, we used the constitutively-active (CA)-Src-Y527F (33Cooper J.A. Gould K.L. Cartwright C.A. Hunter T. Science. 1986; 231: 1431-1434Crossref PubMed Scopus (344) Google Scholar) to enhance Src-dependent phosphorylation signals. CHO cells were individually transfected with KCNQ2, KCNQ3, or KCNQ5 (we had technical problems in these assays with KCNQ4) either alone or together with CA-Src. Whole-cell lysates were precipitated with anti-Myc antibodies, the precipitates were separated by SDS-PAGE, and immunoblots were performed with anti-phosphotyrosine antibodies. In this assay, only direct phosphorylations of the channel proteins will result in a phosphotyrosine signal in the immunoblots. We found that both KCNQ3 and KCNQ5 were strongly tyrosine phosphorylated in a wholly Src-dependent manner but that KCNQ2 showed only a very faint phosphorylation signal that was not Src-dependent at all (Fig. 2B). Similar results were seen in three such assays. These results are in accord with the subunit-specific sensitivity of KCNQ channels to Src action and with our earlier phosphotyrosine assays that associated phosphotyrosine signals with KCNQ3–5 but not with KCNQ2 (25Gamper N. Stockand J.D. Shapiro M.S. J. Neurosci. 2003; 23: 84-95Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The present data indicate that Src acts by direct phosphorylation of channel tyrosines and that binding of the kinase to the channels is not sufficient for the subunit-specific modulation of KCNQ currents by the kinase. Two Tyrosines Are Specifically Phosphorylated by Src— Given that mutation of either Tyr-67 or Tyr-349 in KCNQ3 abolished Src modulation of KCNQ3-containing channels, we asked which of these tyrosines or the other tyrosines that we mutated are phosphorylated by Src. To answer this question, we performed immunoprecipitation assays similar to those shown in Fig. 2B using the mutant Myc-tagged KCNQ3 channels tested in Fig. 1. In these assays, we used wt KCNQ3 and KCNQ2 as positive and negative controls, respectively. Fig. 3 shows a representative exp"
https://openalex.org/W2094849741,"We previously demonstrated that the formation of complexes between the DNA binding domains of the hepatocyte nuclear factor 6 (HNF6) and Forkhead Box a2 (Foxa2) transcription factors resulted in synergistic transcriptional activation of a Foxa2 target promoter. This Foxa2·HNF6 transcriptional synergy was mediated by the recruitment of CREB-binding protein (CBP) coactivator through the HNF6 Cut-Homeodomain sequences. Although the HNF6 DNA binding domain sequences are sufficient to recruit CBP coactivator for HNF6·Foxa2 transcriptional synergy, paradoxically these HNF6 Cut-Homeodomain sequences were unable to stimulate the transcription of an HNF6-dependent reporter gene. Here, we investigated whether the CBP coactivator protein played a different role in regulating HNF6 transcriptional activity. We showed that acetylation of the HNF6 protein by CBP increased both HNF6 protein stability and its ability to stimulate transcription of the glucose transporter 2 promoter. Mutation of the HNF6 Cut domain lysine 339 residue to an arginine residue abrogated CBP acetylation, which is required for HNF6 protein stability. Furthermore, the HNF6 K339R mutant protein, which failed to accumulate detected protein levels, was transcriptionally inactive and could not be stabilized by inhibiting the ubiquitin proteasome pathway. Finally, increased HNF6 protein levels stabilized the Foxa2 protein, presumably through the formation of the Foxa2·HNF6 complex. These studies show for the first time that HNF6 protein stability is controlled by CBP acetylation and provides a novel mechanism by which the activity of the CBP coactivator may regulate steady levels of two distinct liver-enriched transcription factors."

Here we demonstrate that antibodies against the human La protein specifically precipitate HBV RNA from HBV ribonucleoprotein-containing mammalian cell extracts, providing evidence for the association between human La and HBV RNA. Moreover, we report that the turnover of HBV RNA depends on structural features and less on the primary sequence of the La-binding site on the viral RNA. In addition we show that the interaction between human La and HBV RNA in vitro is modulated by accessory factor(s) in a phosphorylation-dependent manner.

RNA metabolism depends on the formation of ribonucleoprotein particles mediating diverse processes such as splicing, polyadenylation, nuclear export, and the regulation of mRNA stability (1Keene J.D.

Such stimuli can alter the RNA binding activity of proteins on the post-translational level by phosphorylation or dephosphorylation and thereby the processing and stability of RNAs (3Kracht M. Saklatvala J. Cytokine. 2002; 20: 91-106Crossref PubMed Scopus (208) Google Scholar, 4Bevilacqua A. Ceriani M.C. Capaccioli S. Nicolin A. J. Cell.

In addition, RNA processing depends on various cis-acting elements including splice sites, export elements, and endoribonucleolytic cleavage sites recognized by RNA-binding proteins. To understand fully the regulation of processing of a specific RNA, both trans-acting factors and cis-acting elements as well as their functions need to be known. The same applies for a detailed understanding of the metabolism of viral RNA. Such studies could lead to the identification of novel cellular targets valuable for the development of innovative antiviral strategies when focused on the post-transcriptional control of RNAs of viruses with global medical importance. This applies to hepatitis B virus (HBV) with more than 300 million chronically infected carriers worldwide who await more effective antiviral therapies. HBV is a noncytopathic, hepatotropic virus with a 3.2-kb circular DNA genome. After conversion into a covalently closed circular DNA, this genome serves in the nucleus as a template for transcription of all viral RNAs. Synthesis of these transcripts is driven by at least four promotors, leading to a large size heterogeneity with many different 5′-ends, whereas they all have very similar 3′-ends because of processing at the same polyadenylylation site (6Seeger C. Mason W.S. Microbiol. Mol. Biol. Rev. 2000; 64: 51-68Crossref PubMed Scopus (1183) Google Scholar). The so-called pregenomic RNA (slightly longer than genome length) is encapsidated into nucleocapsids where it is reverse-transcribed into viral DNA. This RNA serves also as messenger for synthesis of the viral P protein as well as for the core protein. The viral surface proteins as well as a regulatory protein with a role in hepatocarcinogenesis, designated HBx, are translated from subgenomic mRNAs at 2.4, 2.1, and 0.7 kb in length. Recently, several factors and cis-acting elements involved in the post-transcriptional control of the HBV gene expression were described. A number of publications highlighted the potential of cytokines to induce the post-transcriptional down-regulation of HBV RNA (for review see Ref. 7Heise T.D. Dandri U.M. Petersen J. Rang A.

In the HBV transgenic mouse model, the cytotoxic T lymphocyte (CTL) response to HBV antigens was shown to inhibit HBV replication by a post-transcriptional, noncytotoxic mechanism, leading to effective viral RNA degradation as induced by interferon-γ and tumor necrosis factor-α (8Guidotti L.G.

Investig. 1997; 99: 1472-1477Crossref PubMed Scopus (349) Google Scholar). While trying to evaluate the intracellular mechanism(s) responsible for the cytokine-mediated post-transcriptional destabilization of HBV RNA, the mouse La autoantigen (homologue to human La autoantigen) has been identified. The La protein interacts with a small cis-acting element located within the viral RNA between nt 1275 and 1291 (16Heise T. Guidotti L.G. Chisari F.V. J. Virol. 1999; 73: 5767-5776Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 17Horke S. Reumann K. Rang A. Heise T. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 34949-34958Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). The tight temporal correlation between the cytokine-mediated down-regulation of HBV RNA and the cytokine-induced fragmentation of full-length La led to the assumption that full-length La stabilizes HBV RNA by interacting with the cis-acting element (18Heise T. Guidotti L.G. Cavanaugh V.J. Chisari F.V. J. Virol. 1999; 73: 474-481Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Recently, it has been shown that HBV RNA is cleaved close to the La-binding site by an endoribonucleolytic activity present in nuclear extracts prepared from HBV transgenic mice (19Heise T. Guidotti L.G. Chisari F.V. J. Virol. 2001; 75: 6874-6883Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). Up-regulation of this activity coincided with the cytokine-induced fragmentation of La and the degradation of HBV RNA, supporting the assumption that HBV RNA is more accessible to endoribonucleolytic cleavage after the disappearance of full-length La protein. More specifically, we hypothesize that La, in concert with additional trans-acting factors, forms an HBV RNA ribonucleoprotein complex stabilizing HBV RNA. The La protein has been described as important cellular factor involved in the RNA metabolism of a variety of viruses. Most often a function of La was attributed to the translational regulation of viruses like polio and hepatitis C (20Ali N. Siddiqui A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 2249-2254Crossref PubMed Scopus (246) Google Scholar, 21Shimazaki T. Honda M. Kaneko S. Kobayashi K.

Chem. 2003; 278: 12231-12240Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). In cultured cells relocalization of the predominantly nuclear La protein into the cytoplasm during infection was frequently observed (24Shiroki K. Isoyama T. Kuge S. Ishii T. Ohmi S. Hata S. Suzuki K. Takasaki Y. Nomoto A. J. Virol. 1999; 73: 2193-2200Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 25Bachmann M. Falke D. Schroder H.C. Muller W.E. J. Gen. Virol. 1989; 70: 881-891Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). Moreover, La protein was reported to stabilize not only cellular histone mRNA (26McLaren R.S. Caruccio N. Ross J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 3028-3036Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar) but also RNA of hepatitis C virus (27Spangberg K. Wiklund L. Schwartz S. J. Gen. Virol. 2001; 82: 113-120Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). We studied whether hLa is associated with full-length HBV RNA, and we evaluated the importance of the La-binding site for the half-life of HBV RNA. We show that HBV RNA is co-precipitated with hLa, a strong indication for a physical interaction between hLa and HBV RNA in living cells. In addition, we demonstrate in transient transfection experiments that disruption of the proposed La-binding site diminishes the HBV RNA half-life. Furthermore, we show that recombinant hLa binds WT and mutant HBV RNA with the same affinity but with lower specificity, thus arguing for the requirement of accessory factors for a specific interaction. Collectively, these results support the concept that hLa contributes to HBV RNA stability. Plasmid Constructs and Mutagenesis—The HBV expression plasmid pCH-9/3091 (kind gift of H. Schaller, Heidelberg, Germany) referred to as pHBV-WT contains a more than full-length HBV genome (subtype ayw) in which synthesis of the pregenomic RNA is under control of a CMV promotor. Mutations were introduced into the plasmid by PCR according to the site-directed mutagenesis method (Stratagene) using proofreading Pwo DNA polymerase (Roche Applied Science). Different nucleotide substitutions were introduced with the following oligonucleotides: mutant pHBV-M2, sense primer (5′-CCG ATC CAT ACT AAG GAA CTC CTA GAA GCT TGT TTT GCT C-3′), and antisense primer (5′-G AGC AAA ACA AGC TTC TAG GAG TTC CTT AGT ATG GAT CGG-3′); mutant pHBV-M7, sense primer (5′-GCC GAT CCA TAC TCG CCA ACT CCT AGG GCG TTG TTT TGC TCG C-3′), and antisense primer (5′-G CGA GCA AAA CAA CGC CCT AGG AGT TGG CGA GTA TGG ATC GGC-3′); mutant pHBV-M12, sense primer (5′-GCG GAA CTC CTA TAC GCT TGT TTT GCT CG-3′), and antisense primer (5′-CGA GCA AAA CAA GCG TAT AGG AGT TCC GC-3′); mutant pHBV-M13, sense primer (5′-CCA TAC TGC GGA AAT AAT AGC CGC TTG TTT TGC TGC-3′), and antisense primer (5′-CGA GCA AAA CAA GCG GCT ATT ATT TCC GCA GTA TGG-3′). ptetHBV contains a more than full-length HBV genome (subtype ayw) in which synthesis of the pregenomic RNA is under control of the tet promotor (kindly provided by Dr. Christoph Seeger and described in Ref. 28Rang A. Will H. Nucleic Acids Res. 2000; 28: 1120-1125Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). To introduce mutation M-2 into ptetHBV plasmid, the DraIII and NcoI fragments of pHBV-M2 were ligated into the DraIII- and NcoI-linearized ptetHBV by using standard methods. The plasmid was designated ptetHBV-M2. Correct mutagenesis was confirmed by sequencing by using the Taq cycle sequencing protocol with IRD-800-labeled primers (MWG Biotec, Ebersberg, Germany) and a Licor automated sequencing device (MWG Biotec). Cell Culture and Transfection Procedure—1.3 × 106 Huh-7 human hepatoma cells were grown as monolayers in 4 ml of Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum per 60-mm dish. All plasmids used for transfection were purified by using the Maxiprep kit (Qiagen). Transfections were performed using FuGENE 6 Transfection Reagent (Roche Applied Science) according to the manufacturer's protocol. HBV expression plasmid (1.5 μg) was co-transfected with 0.5 μg of pCMV/SEAP (kindly provided by J. Taylor, Philadelphia), which codes for a secreted alkaline phosphatase, or, if indicated, with 0.07 μg of pEGFP-N1. To monitor transfection efficiency, Northern blot membranes were hybridized with a GFP mRNA-specific probe, or the amount of secreted alkaline phosphatase activity secreted into the medium of transfected cells was determined as described previously (9Rang A. Gunther S. Will H. J. Hepatol. 1999; 31: 791-799Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). In Vitro Transcription for Northern Blot Analysis—HBV-specific antisense RNA probe (referred to as HBV probe 1, spanning nucleotides 1403–2907) was generated by in vitro transcription with T3 RNA polymerase (Promega) by using the XhoI-linearized plasmid pBSK c/x (kindly provided by G. Sommer, Hamburg, Germany). GAPDH mRNA antisense RNA probes were generated by in vitro transcription of the SacI-linearized plasmid pBSK-GAPDH (kindly provided by K. Harbers, Hamburg, Germany) using T7 RNA polymerase (Promega). DNA templates used for the in vitro transcription to generate antisense RNA probes specific for HBV pregenomic RNA, histone 2A mRNA, and GFP mRNA were raised by PCR. pWA 175 (containing the histone H2A/a gene, kindly provided by W. Albig, Göttingen, Germany) was used for the production of DNA templates for the generation of histone 2A antisense transcripts. Two primers were used for PCR as follows: the antisense primer (5′-gga tcc taa tac gac tca cta tag gGA ACA TTG AGA TTT CAG GC-3′) contained a restriction site for ClaI (shown with underlines), the T7 RNA polymerase promotor sequence (shown in boldface), and the histone 2A sequence spanning nt 829–847 (shown by capitol letters); and the sense primer contained histone 2A sequences from nt 19 to 37 (5′-CAG CAG TGA GAA TGA ACG C-3′). Plasmid pEGFP-N1 was used for the production of DNA templates for the generation of GFP antisense transcripts. Two primers were used as follows: the antisense primer (5′-gga tcc taa tac gac tca cta tag gGT CCA TGC CGA GAG TGA TCC C-3′) contained a restriction site for ClaI (shown with underlines), the T7 RNA polymerase promotor sequence (shown in boldface), and the GFP sequence (shown by capitol letters); and the sense primer contained GFP sequences (5′-CCT GGT CGA GCT GGA CGG C-3′). PCRs for the templates were performed with 1 ng of plasmid, and the mixture contained 80 pmol of each primer in 1× PCR buffer, 0.2 mm GTP, ATP, TTP, and CTP, and 2.5 units of TaqDNA polymerase (Roche Applied Science). PCR was performed as follows: 5 min at 95 °C, followed by 35 cycles of 1 min at 95 °C, 1 min at 56 °C, and 1 min at 72 °C and finally once for 5 min at 72 °C. The PCR products were purified by size exclusion using Microspin G-25 columns (Amersham Biosciences), according to the manufacturer's protocol, ethanol-precipitated, and used as templates for in vitro transcription. Transcription reactions were carried out with 0.5–1.0 μg of linearized plasmid or PCR product in a final volume of 20 μl in transcription buffer (Promega) containing 0.31 mm ATP, CTP, and GTP, 0.25 μm UTP, and 5.0 μm [α-32P]UTP (800 Ci/mmol) (Hartmann Analytic, Braunschweig, Germany), 5 mm DTT, and 20 units of RNasin (Promega). The reaction was started by the addition of 20 units of T7 RNA polymerase (Promega). After incubation for 45 min at 37 °C, another 20 units of T7 RNA polymerase were added, and the reaction was continued for 45 min at 37 °C. The reaction was terminated by adding 10 μg of yeast tRNA and 1 unit of DNase I (Promega) and incubated for 15 min at 37 °C. Unin-corporated nucleotides were removed by using Microspin G-25 columns. Northern Blot Analysis—Huh-7 cells were harvested for 48 h or as indicated after transfection. Total RNA was prepared by using TriPure Isolation Reagent (Roche Applied Science) according to the manufacturer's protocol. 10 μg of total RNA was separated on a 1.2% agarose-formaldehyde gel. RNA was blotted onto a nylon membrane (Osmonics, Westborough, MA) and hybridized with 32P-labeled in vitro transcribed RNA probes overnight at 68 °C. To standardize transfection efficiency and RNA loading, Northern blots were hybridized with 32P-labeled in vitro transcribed antisense GFP probe and antisense glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH) or antisense histone 2A probes, respectively. Blots were exposed to Fuji imaging screens, and signals were quantified by Fujix BAS 2000 bio-imaging analyzer (Fuji, Japan) and by TINA software (Raytest, Germany). Determination of Pregenomic HBV-RNA Half-life by Using the Tet-Off System—Huh-7 cells were transfected with 1.5 μg of ptetHBV-WT or ptetHBV-M2 and 0.5 μg of pUHD-TA, expressing tTA, the tetracycline-controlled transactivator. Synthesis of pregenomic RNA was blocked by addition of 500 ng/ml doxycycline to the culture medium 24 or 40 h after transfection. Cells were harvested directly upon addition of doxycycline or 3, 6, and 8 h thereafter. Total RNA was prepared and analyzed by Northern blot analysis. Co-immunoprecipitation and RT-PCR—For immunoprecipitation of endogenous hLa-RNA complexes, about 107 HepG2 2.15 cells were harvested, and cell lysates were prepared as described previously (29Tenenbaum S.A. Lager P.J. Carson C.C. Keene J.D. Methods. 2002; 26: 191-198Crossref PubMed Scopus (234) Google Scholar). Briefly, cells were washed twice with ice-cold PBS, collected in 500 μlof ice-cold polysomal lysis buffer containing 10 mm HEPES, pH 7.0, 100 mm KCl, 5 mm MgCl2, 1 mm DTT, and 0.5% Nonidet P-40. 120 units of RNasin (Promega), 4 μl of ribonucleoside vanadyl complex (200 μg/μl, Sigma), and protease inhibitor mixture (Roche Applied Science) were freshly added. Cells were pipetted up and down and incubated for 10 min on ice. The lysate was centrifuged at 14,000 × g for 10 min at 4 °C, and the supernatant was removed and centrifuged again. The final supernatant was stored on ice until use. Protein A-Sepharose 4 fast flow beads (Amersham Biosciences) were blocked with bovine serum albumin and pre-coated with specific antibodies as described previously (29Tenenbaum S.A. Lager P.J. Carson C.C. Keene J.D. Methods. 2002; 26: 191-198Crossref PubMed Scopus (234) Google Scholar). Mouse anti-La antibody (about 7 μg of SW5, kindly provided by M. Bachmann) or a purified mouse IgG (7.5 μg per reaction, Sigma) were used. The antibody-coated beads were washed six times with 900 μl of NT2 buffer containing 50 mm Tris, pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl, 1 mm MgCl2, 0.05% Nonidet P-40. Finally, the pellets were resuspended in 850 μl of NT2 buffer, supplemented with 4 μl of vanadyl ribonucleoside complex, 160 units of RNasin, and 20 mm EDTA, and 100 μl of cell lysate. The immunoprecipitation reactions were rotated (head over head) at 4 °C overnight. Beads were collected by centrifugation at 800 × g for 2 min, and pellets were washed six times with ice-cold NT2 buffer. Pellets for Western blot analysis were resolved in 100 μl of SDS denaturing buffer, and pellets for RNA analysis were resuspended in 100 μl of NT2 buffer supplemented with 0.01% SDS, 40 μg of proteinase K (Roche Applied Science) and incubated at 50 °C for 30 min in a thermomixer (1000 rpm); subsequently, RNA was extracted by using the TriPure isolation reagent (Roche Applied Science) and precipitated in the presence of 20 μg of glycogen. For Northern blot analysis, the complete RNA pellet was solved in 40 μl of loading buffer, loaded onto a 1.2% agarose-formaldehyde gel, and processed as described above. Western blot analysis was performed by standard methods, using 12.5% polyacrylamide gels and nitrocellulose membranes. For RT-PCR analysis, the RNA pellets (starting material, pellets, and supernatants) were solved in 43 μl of diethyl pyrocarbonate-treated water; subsequently, 5 μl of RNase-free DNase reaction buffer (Promega) and 2 units of RNase-free DNase (Promega) were added and incubated for 30 min at 37 °C. DNase was inactivated by heating the sample for 10 min at 70 °C. 2 μl of DNase-treated RNA was used as template for RT-PCR. RT-PCR was conducted by using the Titan One-Tube RT-PCR kit (Roche Applied Science), and the following primer pairs were used: HBV sense, 5′-GGACCCCTTCTCGTGTTACAG-3′, and antisense, 5′-GCTGGTTGTTGAGGATCCTGG-3′; L-37 sense, 5′-ACGAAGGGAACGTCATCGT-3′, and antisense, 5′-CATTCGACCAGTTCCGGT-3′; hnRNP E2 sense, 5′-GACACCGGTGTGATTGAAGG-3′, and antisense, 5′-CTCAGGACAATTCCCTTCTGAG-3′. Expression, Purification, Phosphorylation, Dephosphorylation of Recombinant hLa Protein, and Preparation of Nuclear Extracts—Recombinant hLa protein was prepared as described previously (17Horke S. Reumann K. Rang A. Heise T. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 34949-34958Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). Phosphorylation of recombinant hLa was performed for 3 h at 37 °Cin30-μl reactions containing 1 μg of hLa, 0.2 μl of casein kinase II (New England Biolabs), 3 μl of 10× reaction buffer, and 6 μl of 1 mm ATP. Dephosphorylation occurred with shrimp-alkaline phosphatase (Roche Applied Science) or λ-protein phosphatase (New England Biolabs) according to the manufacturer's instructions. All reactions were controlled by two-dimensional SDS-PAGE, and efficient hyperphosphorylation or dephosphorylation was verified (data not shown). For preparation of nuclear extracts, Huh-7 cells were plated in 15-cm dishes, grown until confluence, washed twice with 1× PBS, harvested in 1 ml of 1× PBS, and collected by centrifugation at 500 × g for 5 min. Cells were resuspended in 1 ml of 1× PBS and pelleted by centrifugation for 10 s at 10,000 × g. Subsequently, the cell pellet was suspended in 600 μl of buffer A containing 20 mm HEPES, pH 7.9, 1.5 mm MgCl2, 10 mm KCl, 0.2 mm EDTA, 0.1% Nonidet P-40, and at the time of use 0.5 mm DTT and 40 μl/ml protease inhibitor mix (Roche Applied Science) were added. Samples were placed on ice for 10 min. Cell lysis was controlled by light microscopy. Nuclei were collected by centrifugation for 1 min at 8000 × g and resuspended in 150 μl of buffer B containing 20 mm HEPES, pH 7.9, 1,5 mm MgCl2, 10mm KCl, 420 mm NaCl, 0.2 mm EDTA, 25% glycerol, and freshly added 0.5 mm DTT and 40 μl/ml protease inhibitor mix. Samples were placed on ice for 20 min, and cell lysate was cleared by centrifugation at 10,000 × g for 10 min and stored at –70 °C. Gel Retardation Assay—The standard binding reaction was carried out in a final volume of 40 μl with 200 ng of purified recombinant hLa protein as indicated and about 200,000 cpm or molar concentrations, as indicated, of 32P-radiolabeled HBV RNA.B in binding buffer containing 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 3 mm MgCl2, 200 mm NaCl, 0.5 mm EDTA, and 0.5% Nonidet P-40 (unless otherwise stated). The in vitro transcribed 32P-labeled RNA.B was denatured at 75 °C for 10 min and renatured by cooling slowly to room temperature prior to addition to the reaction mixture. Samples were incubated for 30 min at room temperature. After addition of 5 μl of electrophoresis buffer containing 10% glycerol and 0.01% bromphenol blue, reaction mixtures were separated on an 8% native polyacrylamide gel (18 × 18 cm) for 3–4 h at 200 V at room temperature. The gels were pre-run at 240 V for 1 h in 1× TBE containing 45 mm Tris, 45 mm boric acid, 1 mm EDTA. Gels were dried (for 1.5 h at 80 °C) on Whatman paper (Whatman) using a Bio-Rad Slab Dryer model 483, and signals were evaluated using a FUJIX BAS 2000 PhosphorImager System (Fuji, Germany) or documented via exposure to x-ray films. For supershift analysis, 100 ng of NiNTA-purified hLa was preincubated with 5 μl of antibody (as indicated in the figures) and 20 units of RNasin (Promega) in a 20-μl volume of 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 4 °C for 1 h, before the nuclear extracts and the other components of the standard reaction and the labeled RNA were added. Analysis of RNA-Protein Interactions with Surface Plasmon Resonance Technology—Real time affinity determination of recombinant human La protein with different RNAs was achieved by using a BIA-core-2000 device (BIAcore, Germany) producing the “sensorgram.” All experiments were performed at 25 °C with a nitrilotriacetic acid (NTA) sensor chip (Biacore) and the histidine-tagged recombinant hLa proteins and gel-purified in in vitro transcribed HBV RNA.B-WT, -M2, and -M7. The chip contains four flow cells that were treated and detected simultaneously. All four flow cells were loaded with 25 μl of loading buffer (500 μm NiSO4 in running buffer (see below)) at 10 μl min–1, which resulted in a stable average increase of 100–250 response units (RUs). After washing flow cells for 150 s at 10 μl min–1 with running buffer (10 mm HEPES, pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl, 50 μm EDTA, 0.005% Tween 20), proteins were injected from 0.2 μm solutions with 5 μl min–1 into flow cells 1–3. Protein attachment to the chip surface was manually restricted to yield a mean difference of 1000–1300 RUs, where 1000 RUs corresponds to ∼1.0 ng/mm2 (30Johnsson B. Lofas S. Lindquist G. Anal. Biochem. 1991; 198: 268-277Crossref PubMed Scopus (1199) Google Scholar). Later, RNA was injected into all four flow cells, thereby obtaining triple values (flow cells 1–3) each with one negative control (flow cell 4) reflecting potential unspecific binding of RNA to the nickel-coated chip surface. Application of RNAs resulted in RU differences of 30–500, depending on the amount loaded. To exclude that any RNA potentially still bound to the fixed protein after a study could interfere with subsequent analysis, the chip surface was regenerated after measurement by applying 30 μl of regeneration buffer (10 mm HEPES, pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl, 100 mm EDTA, 0.005% Tween 20) with 10 μl min–1 before the chip was loaded and prepared for successive measurements. RNAs were supplied in at least four different concentrations, which resulted in consistent data where the level of response units after RNA loading increased with the amount of RNA loaded. Data were evaluated with the BIAevaluation 3.0.2 software (Biacore); curves of flow cell 4 without protein were subtracted from the corresponding protein containing flow cells 1–3, and results were fitted into Langmuir's model of 1:1 binding. As for the fit, software internal χ2 standards never exceeded values above 0.8, and Rmax values were in the expected ranges, and the residuals had a mean deviation from fitted graphs of less than 1.0 (not shown). Estimated half-life of a given RNA-protein complex was calculated as t½ = –ln(0.5)/kd. The hLa Protein Is Associated with HBV RNA—Recently, it has been shown that the cytokine-induced post-transcriptional degradation of HBV RNA tightly correlates with the cytokine-dependent processing of the mouse La protein (18Heise T. Guidotti L.G. Cavanaugh V.J. Chisari F.V. J. Virol. 1999; 73: 474-481Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In addition it has been shown that recombinant hLa interacts with in vitro transcribed HBV RNA.B (17Horke S. Reumann K. Rang A. Heise T. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 34949-34958Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). These data suggest an association of La and HBV RNA in living cells. Accordingly, we asked whether it would be possible to co-precipitate HBV RNA with hLa-specific antibodies for immunoprecipitations (IP). For this purpose HepG2 2.15 cells, stably expressing HBV RNA (31Sells M.A. Chen M.L. Acs G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1987; 84: 1005-1009Crossref PubMed Scopus (980) Google Scholar), were harvested and lysed, and subsequently the cleared cell lysate was incubated with either anti-La antibodies or mouse IgG 2A-coated protein A-Sepharose beads. As shown in Fig. 1, A and B, hLa was specifically precipitated and not detectable in the pellet of the control IP. To detect viral RNA in the IP pellets, RNA was extracted from additional pellets immunoprecipitated with h"
https://openalex.org/W2011495264,"In response to ligand binding, G protein-coupled receptors undergo phosphorylation and activate cellular internalization machinery. An important component of this process is the concentration of receptors into clusters on the plasma membrane. Aside from organizing the receptor in anticipation of internalization, little is known of the function of ligand-mediated G protein-coupled receptor clustering, which has traditionally been thought of as being a phosphorylation-dependent event prior to receptor internalization. We now report that following receptor activation, the N-formyl peptide receptor (FPR) forms distinct membrane clusters prior to its association with arrestin. To determine whether this clustering is dependent upon receptor phosphorylation, we used a mutant form of the FPR, ΔST-FPR, which lacks all phosphorylation sites in the carboxyl-terminal domain. We found that activation of the signaling-competent ΔST-FPR resulted in rapid receptor clustering on the plasma membrane independent of Gi protein activation. This clustering required receptor activation since the D71A mutant receptor, which binds ligand but is incapable of transitioning to an active state, failed to induce receptor clustering. Furthermore we demonstrated that FPR-mediated clustering and signaling were cholesterol-dependent processes, suggesting that translocation of the active receptor to lipid rafts may be required for maximal signaling activity. Finally we showed that FPR stimulation in the absence of receptor phosphorylation resulted in translocation of FPR to GM1-rich clusters. Our results demonstrate for the first time that formation of a clustered activated receptor state precedes receptor phosphorylation, arrestin binding, and internalization."
https://openalex.org/W2017542358,"The vasoactive intestinal peptide (VIP) and its G protein-coupled receptors VPAC1 and VPAC2 prominently mediate diverse physiological functions in the neural, endocrine, and immune systems. A deletion variant of mouse VPAC2 has been identified in immune cells that lacks amino acids 367–380 at the carboxyl-terminal end of the seventh transmembrane domain. When expressed at equivalent levels in a human Jurkat T cell line, which has very low endogenous expression of human VPAC1 and VPAC2, wild-type and deletion-variant VPAC2 bound the same amount of 125I-VIP with similar affinity. Unlike wild-type VPAC2, however, deletion-variant VPAC2 did not transduce VIP-elicited increases in intracellular concentration of cyclic AMP, chemotaxis, or suppression of generation of interleukin-2. Natural deletion of part of the last transmembrane domain of VPAC2 thus abrogates signaling functions without apparent alterations of expression or ligand binding.

VPAC1 and VPAC2 each couple to at least two different G proteins and consequently transduce increases in intracellular concentrations of calcium and cyclic AMP, as well as an array of cellular functional responses to VIP and PACAP. VPAC2 is inducible on lymphocytes and regulates the balance between two major types of immune responses (4Voice J.K. Dorsam G. Lee H. Kong Y. Goetzl E.J.

This genomic complexity is considered to explain in part the many different alternatively spliced and other structurally distinct forms of PAC1 (7Zhou C.J. Kikuyama S. Arimura A. Shioda S. Ann. N. Y.

Brain Res. 2002; 105: 29-37Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). However, no such natural mutant forms of VPAC1 and VPAC2 have been identified to date. A search for mutant forms of VPAC2 was carried out by PCR amplification of RNA sequences encoding VPAC2 that were isolated from lymphoid organs of the immune system. The discovery of a naturally occurring variant VPAC2, which lacks a 14-amino acid sequence at the cytosolic end of the seventh transmembrane domain, prompted initial studies of its expression, VIP-binding properties, and characteristics of transduction of cellular biochemical and functional responses to VIP. This deletion-variant VPAC2 appears to bind VIP normally in lymphocyte transfectants but unlike wild-type VPAC2 does not transduce VIP-elicited increases in intracellular concentration of cyclic AMP ([cAMP]i), decreases in generation of interleukin 2 (IL-2), or chemotactic responses. Identification, Cloning, and Sequencing of cDNAs Encoding Mouse Wild-type and Deletion-mutant VPAC2 GPCRs—Total RNA was isolated from thymus and spleen tissues of normal 6–8-week-old C57BL/6 female mice with TRIzol (Invitrogen) for synthesis of first-strand cDNAs using the Superscript II system (Invitrogen). VPAC2 DNAs in the first-strand cDNA array were amplified by PCR with platinum TaqDNA polymerase (Invitrogen) and primers for sequences at the ends of the coding region: 5′-gac tag tcc acc atg agg gcg tcg gtg gtg ctg a-3′ (forward (SpeI)) and 5′-gga att cct aaa tga ctg aag tct ctg act gca gga a-3′ (reverse (EcoRI)). Individual VPAC2 DNAs isolated by 1% agarose gel electrophoresis were introduced into pBluescript II SK(+) phagemids (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA) at the SpeI/EcoRI sites for transformation into Library-Efficiency DH5α Escherichia coli (Invitrogen), selection of colonies with PCR-detectable VPAC2 inserts in plasmid mini-preparations (Qiagen, Valencia, CA), and determination of the sequences of these VPAC2 DNAs with primers for vector sequences: 5′-ctcgaaattaaccctcactaaa-3′ (forward) and 5′-gaattgtaatacgactcactatag-3′ (reverse) (ELIM Biopharmaceuticals, Inc., Hayward, CA). Multiple DNAs encoding wild-type and deletion-variant VPAC2 receptors were subcloned into the pIRESneo3 bicistronic expression vector (BD Biosciences) at the NheI/EcoRI sites and re-sequenced with the primers: 5′-ctcactatagggagacccaagctt-3′ (forward) and 5′-cgcttttgagagggagtactcac-3′ (reverse). Generation of Jurkat Human T Cell Transfectants and Characterization of Their VPAC2 Expression—Replicate suspensions of 107 Jurkat T cells in Opti-MEM I (University of California San Francisco Cell Culture Facility) were incubated as recommended with a mixture of Gene-PORTER transfection reagent and 40 μg of purified pIRES plasmids containing wild-type or deletion-mutant VPAC2 DNA, followed 4 h later by addition of Booster Express reagent number 1 (Gene Therapy Systems, Inc., San Diego, CA). After 24 h, the Jurkat cells were washed and cultured for 2 days in complete RPMI 1640 medium containing 10% fetal bovine plasma, 100 units/ml penicillin G, and 50 μg/ml streptomycin. Geneticin (Invitrogen) then was added to the cultures in steps of 200, 400, and 600 μg/ml every 4–6 days and cultures continued further for 7–10 days prior to quantification of their expression of VPAC GPCRs by real-time PCR. Real-time PCR was carried out as described in an ABI Prism 7700 sequence detection system (9Graeler M. Goetzl E.J. FASEB J. 2002; 16: 1874-1878Crossref PubMed Scopus (192) Google Scholar, 10Wang W.

Western blots of proteins extracted from each transfectant (TF) and untransfected Jurkat T cells, as described (11Xia M. Sreedharan S.P. Goetzl E.J. J. Clin. Immunol. 1996; 16: 21-30Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar), were developed with a rabbit antibody to the amino-terminal sequence 54–70 (12Kaltreider H.B. Ichikawa S. Byrd P.K. Ingram D.A.

Mouse anti-human CD45 monoclonal antibody (clone 69, IgG1, PharMingen) was used to standardize the quantity of cellular proteins added to each well. Intact cellular binding of 3-[125I]iodotyrosyl-VIP (specific activity = 2,000 Ci/mmol, PerkinElmer Life Sciences) was quantified as described (13Sreedharan S.P. Patel D.R. Xia M. Ichikawa S.

Assessment of Biochemical and Functional Responses of Jurkat T Cell TFs to VIP—To measure VIP-evoked increases in the intracellular concentration of cyclic AMP, [cAMP]i, replicate 0.5-ml aliquots of 106 TFs/ml of RPMI 1640 with 1 mg/ml crystallized bovine serum albumin and 5 μm Ro20-1724 (Biomol, Plymouth Meeting, PA) were added to 24-well plates. After 15 min of preincubation at 37 °C in humidified 5% CO2 in air, 10–9 to 10–6m VIP, 10–6m VPAC1-selective agonist [Lys15,Arg16,Leu27]VIP-(1–7)/GRF-(8–27) or 10–6m VPAC2-selective agonist Ac-[Glu8,OCH3-Tyr10,Lys12,Nle17,Ala19,Asp25,Leu26,Lys27,28]VIP-cyclo-(21–25) (14Gourlet P.

Results of preliminary studies at 2, 20, and 60 min showed maximal levels of cAMP at 20 min. After removal of supernates, the T cells were disrupted by incubation for 10 min at 37 °C in 0.25 ml per well of 0.1 m HCl with 1% (v/v) Triton X-100 and re-centrifuged at 4 °C for 10 min at 1,200 × g. The [cAMP]i in the lysate supernates was quantified directly after acetylation with the Correlate-EIA kit (Assay Designs, Inc., Ann Arbor, MI); sensitivity = 0.035 nm and mean recovery = 85%. To determine the extent of VIP suppression of generation of human IL-2 by stimulated Jurkat T cells, replicate 0.6-ml aliquots of 2 × 106 Jurkat cells/ml of complete RPMI 1640 were added to 24-well plates that had been precoated with 0.75 μg/well of mouse anti-human CD3 monoclonal antibody (PharMingen). After addition of 10–9 to 10–6m VIP or 10–6m VPAC1-selective agonist or VPAC2-selective agonist, wells received 20 ng/ml phorbol myristate acetate, and incubations were continued for 48 h at 37 °Cin5%CO2 in humidified air. At 24 and 48 h, 200-μl portions of supernatant were harvested for immunoassays of IL-2 (R&D Systems, Inc., Minneapolis, MN). Chemotaxis of Jurkat T cells was assessed as described (16Zheng Y. Kong Y. Goetzl E.J. J. Immunol. 2001; 166: 2317-2322Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar) after 4 h of incubation in Transwell chambers over 5-μm pore filters, which had been pretreated in 1 μg/ml of human type IV collagen and dried. Stimuli included 10–9 to 10–6m VIP and 100 nm human recombinant SDF-1α chemokine (CXCL-12, Peprotech, Inc., Rocky Hills, NJ). The results of this and other assays are presented as mean ± S.D., and t tests for statistical significance were conducted with the Prism 4 system (GraphPad Software, Inc., San Diego, CA). A variant form of mouse VPAC2 was identified in multiple clones from both spleen and thymus. The sequence showed a deletion of 42 bases and re-alignment, which led to loss of 14 amino acids (367–380) from the carboxyl-terminal end of the seventh transmembrane domain (Table IA). This region may be vital for both cellular behavior and signal transduction of VPAC2, as it is in some other GPCRs with short intracellular loops. Therefore, studies were designed to examine these characteristics of mouse VPAC2 GPCR stable TFs in Jurkat human T cells that have low levels of endogenous human VPAC2 receptors and barely detectable levels of human VPAC1 receptors (Table IB). After several weeks of Geneticin-selection of Jurkat T cells transfected with pIRESneo3-VPAC2 plasmids, the mRNAs encoding wild-type and deletion-variant (deletion-mutant) mouse VPAC2 were substantially more abundant than that encoding endogenous human wild-type VPAC2 (Table IB).Table IStructures of mVPAC2 GPCRs and levels of mRNA expression in Jurkat T cell transfectantsA.

Open table in a new tab Similarly, Western blots of membrane proteins extracted from Jurkat cells showed that total VPAC2 protein levels were substantially higher in wild-type and deletion-mutant mouse VPAC2 TFs than untransfected Jurkat cells (Fig. 1). Although this polyclonal anti-VPAC2 antibody specific for the amino terminus does not distinguish between mouse and human VPAC2 GPCRs, the mRNA measurements indicate that transfection with either mouse VPAC2 decreases the level of message for endogenous human VPAC2 (Table IB). Thus it is assumed that the higher total levels of VPAC2 receptor protein in TFs are attributable nearly totally to the respective mouse VPAC2 GPCR (Fig. 1). The specific binding of 125I-VIP by 106 wild-type and deletion-mutant mouse VPAC2 TFs, respectively, was a mean (±S.D.) of 18,635 ± 3,078 dpm and 19,277 ± 3,552 dpm, as contrasted with 2,490 ± 838 for untransfected Jurkat T cells (n = 2, in duplicate). The respective mean Kd values were 17, 19 and 15 nm. Thus any differences in signaling and transduction of functions between the two forms of mouse VPAC2 are not attributable to altered binding of VIP. One of the principal signals transduced by VIP binding to VPAC2 is a Gαs-mediated increase in [cAMP]i. Several hundredfold increases in the [cAMP]i in wild-type VPAC2 TFs were elicited by VIP in a concentration-dependent relationship up to a maximal level similar to that attained by forskolin (Fig. 2). In contrast, deletion-mutant VPAC2 TFs showed no rise in [cAMP]i at any concentration of VIP. Untransfected Jurkat T cells that express only low levels of human native VPAC2 showed only modest increases in [cAMP]i, which were significant at the highest two concentrations of VIP but never exceeded 10-fold. The striking increments in [cAMP]i evoked by forskolin in all Jurkat cell lines were indistinguishable. In two of the studies where mean increases in [cAMP]i in wild-type VPAC2 TFs were 238-fold and 366-fold with 10–8m and 10–7m VIP, respectively, mean increases were 184-fold for 10–6m VPAC2-selective agonist and 3.2-fold for 10–6m VPAC1-selective agonist. Thus increases in [cAMP]i were mediated solely by signals from VPAC2 GPCRs. The known consistent suppression of T cell generation of IL-2 by VIP was confirmed through VIP concentration-dependent inhibition of IL-2 generation by wild-type VPAC2 TFs stimulated for 24 and 48 h (Fig. 3). After 24 h, inhibition of IL-2 generation in wild-type VPAC2 TFs was significant at 10–8 to 10–6m VIP and achieved a maximal level of over 60% at 10–6m VIP. After 48 h, inhibition was significant at 10–7 and 10–6m VIP with maximal suppression of 52% at 10–7m VIP. IL-2 generation by stimulated untransfected Jurkat T cells was just marginally suppressed only by 10–6m VIP at 24 h and not at all at 48 h. There was no inhibitory effect of any concentration of VIP at either time on IL-2 generation by stimulated deletion-mutant TFs (Fig. 3). In two of the studies where mean suppression of IL-2 generation in wild-type VPAC2 TFs were 30 and 48% with 10–8m and 10–7m VIP, respectively, mean inhibition was 44% for 10–6m VPAC2-selective agonist and only 5% for 10–6m VPAC1-selective agonist. As for [cAMP]i responses, suppression of IL-2 generation was mediated solely by signals from VPAC2 GPCRs. Wild-type VPAC2 TFs showed significant chemotactic responses to 10–9 to 10–6m VIP, concentration-dependent increments in responses, and maximal chemotaxis at 10–7m VIP, as had been observed for human blood and mouse spleen T cells (Fig. 4) (17Xia M. Leppert D. Hauser S.L. Sreedharan S.P. Nelson P.J. Krensky A.M. Goetzl E.J. J. Immunol. 1996; 156: 160-167PubMed Google Scholar). In contrast, untransfected Jurkat T cells showed marginal chemotactic responses only to 10–8 and 10–7m VIP, and deletion-mutant VPAC2 TFs did not respond at all to VIP (Fig. 4). It is not yet known whether this deletion-variant arises from a mutation, alternative splicing, or another mechanism. It also is difficult to predict the effects on VPAC2 structure of deleting amino acids 367–380, which constitute the carboxyl-terminal end of the seventh transmembrane domain (Table IA). Two predictions seem certain, both of which are consistent with the observed properties of the deletion-variant mouse VPAC2 in Jurkat T cells. First, most sites of post-translational modifications involved in signaling and for docking of signaling proteins are in the carboxyl-terminal tail. The likely retraction and distortion of this intracellular tail induced by the amino acid sequence deletion would be expected to alter signaling and consequently cellular functional effects. Thus it is not surprising that TFs expressing deletion-mutant VPAC2 GPCRs at a level equal to that of the wild-type VPAC2 GPCRs in parallel TFs (Table IB and Fig. 1) fail to manifest VIP-evoked increases in [cAMP]i, suppression of IL-2 generation, or chemotaxis (Figs. 2, 3, 4). Second, results of studies of structural determinants of VIP binding strongly support requirements for the extracellular amino terminus, portions of the first and second extracellular loops, and part of the fifth transmembrane domain but not the seventh transmembrane domain or carboxyl terminus (18Nicole P. Du K. Couvineau A. Laburthe M. J. Pharmacol. Exp. Ther. 1998; 284: 744-750PubMed Google Scholar, 19Juarranz M.G. Van Rampelbergh J. Gourlet P. De Neef P. Cnudde J. Robberecht P. Waelbroeck M. Mol.

Thus normal expression and VIP-binding properties of the deletion-mutant VPAC2 GPCR are not unexpected. What remains to be elucidated about the deletion-variant VPAC2 GPCR is the mechanism of its generation, its cell and tissue distribution, determinants of the regulation of its expression during development and after cellular activation, and its natural functional role in immunity and other physiological and pathobiological activities affected by the VIP-VPAC2 GPCR axis."
https://openalex.org/W2004762052,"Nucleoside diphosphate kinase (NdK) is a ubiquitous enzyme in both prokaryotes and eukaryotes and is primarily involved in the maintenance of cellular nucleotide pools. We have cloned ndk from Mycobacterium tuberculosis strain H37Ra and expressed it in Escherichia coli as a fusion protein with glutathione S-transferase. The purified protein, following thrombin cleavage and gel permeation chromatography, was found to be hexameric with a monomeric unit molecular mass of ∼16.5 kDa. The protein exhibited nucleotide binding, divalent cation-dependent autophosphorylation, and phosphate transfer ability from nucleoside triphosphate to nucleoside diphosphate. Although UDP inhibited the catalytic activity of the recombinant protein, the classic inhibitors, like cromoglycate, 5′-adenosine 3′-phosphate, and adenosine 3′-phosphate 5′-phosphosulfate, had no effect on the activity. Among three histidine residues in the protein, His-117 was found to be essential for autophosphorylation. However, in subsequent phosphate transfer, we observed that His-53 had a significant contribution. Consistent with this observation, substitution of His-53 with either Ala or Gln affected the ability of the recombinant protein to complement NdK function in Pseudomonas aeruginosa. Furthermore, mutational analysis established critical roles for Tyr-50 and Arg-86 of the M. tuberculosis protein in maintaining phosphotransfer ability.

Furthermore, mutational analysis established critical roles for Tyr-50 and Arg-86 of the M. tuberculosis protein in maintaining phosphotransfer ability. Nucleoside triphosphates or their deoxy derivatives (NTP/dNTP) are of fundamental importance for the survival of any living organism, because they act as precursors for synthesis of macromolecules like nucleic acids. Nucleoside diphosphate kinase (NdK) 1The abbreviations used are: NdK, nucleoside diphosphate kinase; ABTS, 2,2′-azino-bis(3-ethylbenzthiazoline-6-sulfonic acid); FSBA, 5′-p-fluorosulfonylbenzoyl adenosine; GST, glutathione S-transferase; IPTG, isopropyl-β-d-thiogalactopyranoside; mNdK, M. tuberculosis nucleoside diphosphate kinase; PAP, 5′-adenosine 3′-phosphate; PAPS, adenosine 3′-phosphate 5′-phosphosulfate. plays a pivotal role in the maintenance of intracellular ratios of NTPs and dNTPs. This enzyme has very little specificity for the base or the sugar and catalyzes phosphotransfer reaction from a NTP/dNTP to a NDP through a ping-pong mechanism involving a high energy phosphorylated intermediate (1Lascu I. Gonin P. J. Bioenerg. Biomembr. 2000; 32: 237-246Crossref PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar). NdK has been characterized from several prokaryotes and eukaryotes (2Munoz-Dorado J. Inouye M. Inouye S.

Despite high homology in the amino acid sequence, the functional enzymes are tetrameric in several prokaryotes, whereas in eukaryotes they exist in hexameric form. The crystal structures of many NdKs with or without substrates have been determined, and they are highly conserved from Escherichia coli to human (43% identity) with polypeptides having a molecular size of ∼15 to 18 kDa (7Lascu I. Giartosio A. Ransac S. Erent M. J. Bioenerg. Biomembr. 2000; 32: 227-236Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). Besides their role in maintaining NTP pools, NdKs have also been reported to participate in regulating a variety of cellular functions. Studies in bacteria have revealed that NdK is essential for cell growth and differentiation (2Munoz-Dorado J. Inouye M. Inouye S. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 2702-2706Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 5Sundin G.W. Shankar S. Chugani S.A. Chopade B.A. Kavanaugh-Black A. Chakrabarty A.M. Mol. Microbiol. 1996; 20: 965-979Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). In E. coli, NdK has been shown to act as a protein kinase to phosphorylate histidine kinases like EnvZ and CheA, thereby suggesting its involvement in cross-talk with two component signal transduction systems (8Lu Q. Park H. Egger L.A. Inouye M. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 32886-32893Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). Its role in sequence-dependent DNA binding as well as transcription (9Postel E.H. Berberich S.J. Rooney J.W. Kaetzel D.M. J. Bioenerg.

Interestingly, the DNase activity exhibited by both human and E. coli NdKs has been implicated in base excision repair (12Postel E.H. Abramczyk B.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2003; 100: 13247-13252Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). In Drosophila melanogaster, NdK was involved in development of wing disc cells (13Biggs J. Hersperger E. Steeg P.S. Liotta L.A. Shearn A. Cell. 1990; 63: 933-940Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (332) Google Scholar). Several NdKs have been reported in humans. Although NdKA (NM23-H1) suppressed tumor metastasis in melanoma cells (14Lacombe M.L. Sastre-Garau X. Lascu I. Vonica A. Wallet V. Thiery J.P. Veron M. Eur. J. Cancer. 1991; 27: 1302-1307Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar), NdKB (NM23-H2) has been shown to bind the promoter of c-myc oncogene to activate its transcription (15Hartsough M.T. Steeg P.S. J. Bioenerg. Biomembr. 2000; 32: 301-308Crossref PubMed Scopus (197) Google Scholar). NdK has been found to be present in membranous, cytosolic, and secretory forms (16Kimura N. Shimada N. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 4647-4653Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 17Shankar S. Hershberger C.D. Chakrabarty A.M. Mol. Microbiol. 1997; 24: 477-487Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). Interestingly, in Pseudomonas aeruginosa, interaction of NdK with different proteins has been shown to modulate the synthesis of GTP (17Shankar S. Hershberger C.D. Chakrabarty A.M. Mol. Microbiol. 1997; 24: 477-487Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). Although the membrane-associated form of NdK in this bacteria could complex with the Ras-like protein Pra and/or pyruvate kinase, the cytosolic form interacted with elongation factor TU (Ref. 18Chakrabarty A.M. Mol. Microbiol. 1998; 28: 875-882Crossref PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar and references therein). Extracellular secretion of this enzyme has been reported in Mycobacterium bovis bacillus Calmette-Guérin (19Zaborina O. Li X. Cheng G. Kapatral V. Chakrabarty A.M. Mol. Microbiol. 1999; 31: 1333-1343Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar), P. aeruginosa (20Shankar S. Kamath S. Chakrabarty A.M. J.

Immun. 2000; 68: 4930-4937Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). Because a large number of secretory proteins are usually produced by pathogens to adhere to or infect host cells, they have often been considered as target molecules for designing new vaccines as well as novel drug intervention strategies (23Lefevre P. Braibant M. de Wit L. Kalai M. Roeper D. Grotzinger J. Delville J.P. Peirs P. Ooms J. Huygen K. Content J. J.

In this context, we have focused on tuberculosis, a disease caused by Mycobacterium tuberculosis that is responsible for considerable human morbidity and mortality worldwide due to the rapid resurgence of drug resistant strains in recent years (25Bloom B.R.

Taylor K. Whitehead S. Barrell B.G. Nature. 1998; 393: 537-544Crossref PubMed Scopus (6557) Google Scholar) has revealed the presence of single ndk gene (Rv2445c). It has been reported that mycobacterial NdKs were secretory in nature and might be involved in virulence by the sequestration of ATP from macrophage surface-associated P2Z receptors (19Zaborina O. Li X. Cheng G. Kapatral V. Chakrabarty A.M. Mol. Microbiol. 1999; 31: 1333-1343Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). Furthermore, it has also been reported to be cytotoxic in mouse macrophage cell lines (27Chopra P. Singh A. Koul A. Ramachandran S. Drlica K. Tyagi A.K. Singh Y. Eur. J. Biochem. 2003; 270: 625-634Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). Although a 2.6-Å x-ray structure of NdK from M. tuberculosis (mNdK) has been solved (28Chen Y. Morera S. Mocan J. Lascu I. Janin J. Proteins. 2002; 47: 556-557Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar), its detailed biochemical characterization is not available as yet. Therefore, we concentrated on the mNdK and studied the autophosphorylation as well as phosphotransfer activities of this recombinant protein through structure-function analysis. Our results argued that different amino acid residues are required for autophosphorylation and phosphotransfer activities in mNdK. Although the His-117 was essential for autophosphorylation of the protein, it was not involved in subsequent transfer of phosphate to NDPs. On the other hand, His-53, Tyr-50, and Arg-86 were critical for its phosphotransfer activity. Materials—Restriction/modifying enzymes were obtained from New England Biolabs. All other fine chemicals, including ABTS, different nucleotides, proteinase K, thrombin, PAP, PAPS, FSBA, cromoglycate, and 4-aminoantipyrine were procured from Sigma Chemical Co. Oligonucleotides used in this study were custom synthesized (Biobasic Inc. or IDT). [γ-32P]ATP and [α-32P]dCTP were purchased from Jonaki Laboratories, the Board of Radiation and Isotope Technology, Hyderabad, India PCR Amplification, Construction of Recombinant Plasmids, and Generation of Site-directed Mutants of mNdK—Genomic DNA was isolated from M. tuberculosis strain H37Ra as described previously (29Chaba R. Raje M. Chakraborti P.K. Eur. J. Biochem. 2002; 269: 1078-1085Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar) and used for PCR amplification of ndk. Primers (CT3: 5′-CATATGACCGAACGGACTCTGG 3′ and CT4: 5′-CTAGGCGCCGGGAAACCAG-3′) used for this purpose were designed based on the published ndkA (Rv2445c) sequence of M. tuberculosis (26Cole S.T. Brosch R. Parkhill J. Garnier T. Churcher C. Harris D. Gordon S.V. Eiglmeier K. Gas S. Barry III, C.E. Tekaia F. Badcock K. Basham D. Brown D. Chillingworth T. Connor R. Davies R. Devlin K. Feltwell T. Gentles S. Hamlin N. Holroyd S. Hornsby T. Jagels K. Krogh A. McLean J. Moule S. Murphy L. Oliver K. Osborne J. Quail M.A. Rajandream M.A. Rogers J. Rutter S. Seeger K. Skelton J. Squares R. Squares S. Sulston J.E. Taylor K. Whitehead S. Barrell B.G. Nature. 1998; 393: 537-544Crossref PubMed Scopus (6557) Google Scholar). However, for expression of the protein in E. coli or P. aeruginosa, the start codon was changed to ATG instead of GTG and, accordingly, an NdeI site was incorporated in the primer CT3. The ndk gene (∼411 bp) was PCR-amplified using the GC Rich PCR system (Roche Applied Science) following the manufacturer's recommended protocol. The gene was initially cloned in pT-Adv vector (pTAdv-NdK), and its nucleic acid sequence was determined using an automated sequencer (Applied Biosystems). This construct was subsequently used for subcloning the M. tuberculosis ndk gene in different vectors for its expression in heterologous hosts, like E. coli and P. aeruginosa. pTAdv-NdK was digested with NdeI and treated with DNA polymerase I (Klenow) to obtain a blunt-ended fragment. This fragment was subsequently digested with either HindIII or KpnI for subcloning into different vectors. Similarly, following XhoI digestion of pGEX-KG (30Guan K.L. Dixon J.E. Anal. Biochem. 1991; 192: 262-267Crossref PubMed Scopus (1641) Google Scholar) or pSFFLAG-MAC (31Couch R. Seidle H. Parry R. BioTechniques. 2002; 32: 1230-1236Crossref PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar), the fragments were treated with Klenow. The blunt-ended vectors were then digested with either HindIII (pGEX) or KpnI (pSFFLAG). Finally, the M. tuberculosis ndk gene was ligated to the appropriate vectors to yield pGEX-NdK or pSFFLAG-NdK and transformed in E. coli strain DH5α. Clones containing the gene of interest were confirmed by restriction analysis while junction sequencing was carried out to authenticate in-frame fusions. Genomic DNA from P. aeruginosa type strain MTCC 1934 was extracted following procedures described elsewhere (32Ausubel F.M. Brent R. Kingston R.E. Moore D.D. Seidman J.G. Smith J.A. Struhl K. Current Protocols in Molecular Biology. John Wiley and Sons, New York1998Google Scholar) and used for PCR amplification of a fragment of ∼1.5 kb (nucleotide position 4,265,949–4,267,400 of the genome) containing 431 bp of ndk (nucleotide position 4,266,469–4,266,900; coding sequence at –1 frame). Primers, CT34 (5′-CAACTAGTCTAGACGACATTGGTGATGGCG-3′; XbaI site incorporated) and CT35 (5′-CAAAACGAGCTCCCATCAACCAGGTGTC-3′; SacI site introduced) used for this purpose were designed from the published P. aeruginosa genome sequence (33Stover C.K. Pham X.Q. Erwin A.L. Mizoguchi S.D. Warrener P. Hickey M.J. Brinkman F.S. Hufnagle W.O. Kowalik D.J. Lagrou M. Garber R.L. Goltry L. Tolentino E. Westbrock-Wadman S. Yuan Y. Brody L.L. Coulter S.N. Folger K.R. Kas A. Larbig K. Lim R. Smith K. Spencer D. Wong G.K. Wu Z. Paulsen I.T. Reizer J. Saier M.H. Hancock R.E. Lory S. Olson M.V. Nature. 2000; 406: 959-964Crossref PubMed Scopus (3446) Google Scholar). The PCR-amplified fragment was cloned in pUC19 (pPN1). Subsequently, a kanamycin cassette of ∼1.3 kb (34Oka A. Sugisaki H. Takanami M. J. Mol. Biol. 1981; 147: 217-226Crossref PubMed Scopus (427) Google Scholar) was introduced at the unique NruI site of pPN1 to obtain pPNK1. Thus this plasmid had the kanamycin cassette inserted in the ndk open reading frame and was used for gene disruption in P. aeruginosa. Site-directed mutants of M. tuberculosis ndk (K10A, K29A, H49A, H49Q, Y50F, H53A, H53Q, R86A, R104A, H117A, H117Q, and S119A) were generated using pGEX-NdK as template following the overlap extension PCR method (35Ho S.N. Hunt H.D. Horton R.M. Pullen J.K. Pease L.R. Gene (Amst.). 1989; 77: 51-59Crossref PubMed Scopus (6851) Google Scholar, 36Sarin J. Aggarwal S. Chaba R. Varshney G.C. Chakraborti P.K. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 44590-44597Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). CT31 (in addition to nucleotides in CT3, an XhoI site was incorporated at the 5′-end) and CT32 (HindIII site was added in CT4) were used as external primers. The different internal primers used in generating mutants will be provided upon request. Different mutants (H49A, H49Q, H53A, H53Q, H117A, H117Q, and Y50F) were initially digested with HindIII, treated with Klenow, and finally excised by XhoI digestion. These constructs were then cloned into the XhoI/SmaI sites of pSFFLAG-MAC and used to assess the ability of different mutants to complement NdK function in P. aeruginosa (please see below). Expression and Purification of Recombinant Protein—The pGEX-NdK or different mutants were transformed into E. coli strain BL21(DE3) for overexpression and subsequent purification of proteins. Overnight cultures of these clones (∼15 h at 37 °C in LB broth containing 100 μg/ml ampicillin) were re-inoculated and grown to an A600 of ∼0.6. Cells were then induced with 0.2 mm IPTG, harvested after 3 h, and suspended in lysis buffer (50 mm Tris, pH 8, containing 5 mm EDTA, 50 mm NaCl, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1 μg/ml of pepstatin, and 1 μg/ml leupeptin). Following lysozyme treatment (30 min at 4 °C), cells were sonicated and the supernatant fraction was collected after centrifugation (17,600 × g for 15 min at 4 °C). This fraction was loaded onto a glutathione-agarose affinity column and cleaved with thrombin (55.5 units/5 ml of bed volume) following the manufacturer's recommended protocol. The protein (mNdK or different mutants following removal of GST tag) obtained in this way was subjected to gel permeation chromatography on a fast-protein liquid chromatography unit using a Superdex 200 column. Finally, the purified protein was eluted with elution buffer (50 mm Tris, pH 8, containing 1 mm EDTA), and its concentration was estimated following Bradford's method (37Bradford M.M. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 72: 248-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (217544) Google Scholar). Gene Disruption and Complementation—The ndk gene of P. aeruginosa type strain was disrupted using the pPNK1 gene disruption cassette following the method described elsewhere (38Diver J.M. Bryan L.E. Sokol P.A. Anal. Biochem. 1990; 189: 75-79Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). Twenty-five transformants were selected in LB plates supplemented with kanamycin (200 μg/ml). They were further confirmed by Southern analysis using [α-32P]dCTP-labeled probes (kanamycin-resistant gene and DNA fragment containing P. aeruginosa ndk) following the standard protocol (39Sambrook J. Russel D. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY2001Google Scholar). As expected, SacI digestion of genomic DNA from ndk-disrupted transformants yielded a fragment of ∼10.8 kb compared with that of ∼9.5 kb in wild type cells. One of these transformants was randomly chosen to carry out experiments and was designated as WTd. For complementation studies, ndk (both M. tuberculosis and P. aeruginosa) or other mutants were transformed in WTd, and the expression was confirmed by Western blotting. Autophosphorylation and Phosphotransfer Assays—Autophosphorylating abilities of mNdK or different mutants were assessed by incubating purified proteins in 1× kinase buffer (50 mm Tris-Cl, pH 7.5, 50 mm NaCl, 300 μm MgCl2) in the presence of 2 μCi of [γ-32P]ATP at 24 °C for 1 min. SDS sample buffer (30 mm Tris-Cl, pH 6.8, 5% glycerol, 2.5% β-mercaptoethanol, 1% SDS, and 0.01% bromphenol blue) was added to terminate the reaction. Samples were boiled for 5 min and resolved on 12% SDS-PAGE gels. Gels were analyzed in a phosphorimaging device (Bio-Rad) using Quantity One software and exposed to Kodak X-Omat/AR film for autoradiography (29Chaba R. Raje M. Chakraborti P.K. Eur. J. Biochem. 2002; 269: 1078-1085Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). To monitor the effect of different divalent cations on the autophosphorylating abilities of mNdK, they (Ca+2/Co+2/Cu+2/Mn+2/Zn+2) were added in the kinase buffer instead of MgCl2. Phosphotransfer activities of mNdK or different mutants were monitored in a colorimetric assay performed in microtiter plates (40Lascu I. LeBlay K. Lacombe M.L. Presecan E. Veron M. Anal. Biochem. 1993; 209: 6-8Crossref PubMed Scopus (6) Google Scholar). Briefly, in a 50-μl reaction volume mNdK protein (1–10 ng) was mixed with several ingredients (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 5 mm MgCl2, 75 mm KCl, 1.5 mm 4-aminoantipyrene, 1 mm glycerol, 1.5 mm 3,5-dichlorophenolsulfonic acid, 0.5 mg/ml bovine serum albumin, 1 unit/ml glycerokinase, 2.5 units/ml glycerol-3-phosphate oxidase, 2.5 units/ml peroxidase) along with dGTP (1 mm) as the phosphate donor nucleotide and ADP (5–250 μm) as the substrate. This was followed by incubation (0–8 min) at 24 °C and subsequent monitoring of enzyme activity at 490 nm in an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay plate reader. The values obtained were corrected by subtracting the blank readings (no significant difference was noticed when assays were carried out with all ingredients except either substrate or mNdK or dGTP). Standard curves were prepared with known amounts (5–200 μm) of ATP (omitting dGTP, ADP, and mNdK in reaction mixtures), and the kinase activity of mNdK was expressed as micromoles of ATP produced/min/mg of protein. A preincubation step (20 min or 3 h at 24 °C) with the protein was included in the assays to monitor the influence of varied concentrations of inhibitors (AMP, cyclic AMP, cromoglycate, PAP, PAPS, and UDP). Western Blotting—Polyclonal antibody against mNdK was raised in rabbit following the method described earlier (36Sarin J. Aggarwal S. Chaba R. Varshney G.C. Chakraborti P.K. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 44590-44597Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar) and used for monitoring the expression of mNdK or mutant proteins by Western blotting. The antisera also showed cross-reactivity to NdK of P. aeruginosa. Samples (100 ng to 10 μg of protein/slot) were resolved on SDS-PAGE gels and transferred to nitrocellulose membranes. Blots were probed with primary (anti-mNdK or anti-GST) and secondary (horseradish peroxidase-conjugated anti-rabbit or anti-mouse IgG) antibodies and processed with the ECL detection system (Amersham Biosciences). The ATP-binding ability of the recombinant mNdK was monitored by labeling the protein with a nonhydrolyzable ATP analogue, FSBA, followed by detection through Western blotting using anti-FSBA antibody (Roche Applied Science). Structural Analysis—Analysis of all available NdK structures, including that of mNdK (Protein DataBank accession number 1K44 and Ref. 28Chen Y. Morera S. Mocan J. Lascu I. Janin J. Proteins. 2002; 47: 556-557Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar), were done using either ‘O’ program (41Jones T.A. Zou J.Y. Cowan S.W. Kieldgaard M. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. A. 1991; 47: 110-119Crossref PubMed Scopus (13014) Google Scholar) or ICM (www.molsoft.com) on an SGI O2 graphics system. Overexpression of mNdK—The ndk gene from M. tuberculosis strain H37Ra was amplified by PCR and cloned in the pT-Adv vector. Sequencing of this fragment indicated 100% identity at the nucleotide level with the published ndkA sequence of the pathogenic strain, H37Rv, of M. tuberculosis. To monitor expression of mNdK as a fusion protein with GST, pGEX-NdK was transformed into E. coli strain DH5α or BL21(DE3). Several colonies harboring the expression plasmid were obtained in both hosts. On SDS-PAGE gels, however, cell lysates prepared from E. coli strain DH5α exhibited two IPTG-induced bands (∼41 and ∼43 kDa). On the other hand, the expected ∼43 kDa fusion protein was observed in cell lysates of E. coli strain BL21(DE3) and therefore was used in subsequent studies (Fig. 1A). Approximately 20% of the expressed protein was found to be in the soluble fraction (Fig. 1A, lane 3). The fusion protein was purified by glutathione-agarose affinity chromatography (Fig. 1A, lane 5) and checked by Western blotting using anti-GST antibody (data not shown). GST-mNdK protein was treated with thrombin, further purified through a glutathione-agarose affinity column, and subjected to gel permeation chromatography. The purified mNdK protein containing 16 amino acids from the GST tag was eluted as a single peak in a Superdex 200 column and exhibited a molecular mass of 107 ± 2.56 kDa (mean ± S.D., n = 9). The same sample revealed a molecular mass of 16.5 ± 0.45 kDa (mean ± S.D., n = 12) on SDS-PAGE (Fig. 1A, lane 6). Western blotting with anti-mNdK antibody also recognized the purified protein (Fig. 1B). Considering the presence of 16 amino acids from GST tag in the mNdK, the molecular weight determined by SDS-PAGE analysis was found to be the same as has been predicted from the sequence. Thus our data support a possible hexameric conformation of the active form of mNdK, which is consistent with the value obtained following crystal structure analysis of the protein from M. tuberculosis pathogenic strain H37Rv (28Chen Y. Morera S. Mocan J. Lascu I. Janin J. Proteins. 2002; 47: 556-557Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). mNdK Is a Nucleotide-binding Protein—The nucleotide binding ability of different NdKs has already been established (1Lascu I. Gonin P. J. Bioenerg. Biomembr. 2000; 32: 237-246Crossref PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar, 42Munoz-Dorado J. Inouye S. Inouye M. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 2707-2712Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). To gain insight on this aspect, we utilized a nonhydrolyzable ATP analogue, FSBA, which binds to the nucleotide-binding site of proteins through covalent attachment (43Anostario M. Harrison M. Geahlen R. Anal. Biochem. 1990; 190: 60-65Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). Following the labeling of protein (purified in borate buffer) with FSBA (1 or 3 mm) or treating with Me2SO (solvent control), samples were subjected to SDS-PAGE and immunoblotting using anti-FSBA antibody. As shown in Fig. 1B, anti-FSBA antibody recognized only those samples that were incubated with FSBA (lanes 2 and 3). On the other hand, anti-mNdK antibody recognized all samples of this blot after being stripped (Fig. 1B). Although nonspecific binding of FSBA to mNdK could not be ruled out in our experimental set-up, the evidence we presented strongly suggested that this recombinant protein does bind nucleotides. Therefore, our results corroborated a recent study where the nucleotide binding ability of NdK from M. tuberculosis strain H37Rv was established using a different approach (27Chopra P. Singh A. Koul A. Ramachandran S. Drlica K. Tyagi A.K. Singh Y. Eur. J. Biochem. 2003; 270: 625-634Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). mNdK Exhibits Autophosphorylation and Phosphotransfer Ability—The autophosphorylating ability of mNdK was monitored by incubating it with [γ-32P]ATP in the presence of Mg+2 followed by separation of the reaction products by SDS-PAGE and identification of the labeled proteins in a phosphorimaging device as well as by autoradiography of the dried gels. In vitro assays revealed that mNdK was capable of phosphorylating itself in a concentration-dependent manner (Fig. 2A, lanes 2–7), whereas heat-inactivated (100 °C for 5 min) protein did not show any activity (Fig. 2A, lane 1). The protein was able to autophosphorylate over a broad pH range of 3–12 (data not shown). As shown in Fig. 2B, divalent cations were essential for the autophosphorylation of mNdK (compare lane 1 with lanes 2–7). Interestingly, autophosphorylation of this protein was detectable in the presence of all divalent cations (Ca+2, Co+2, Cu+2, Mg+2, Mn+2, and Zn+2) tested (Fig. 2B). Among the different inhibitors tested (AMP, cyclic AMP, and UDP), only UDP affected the autophosphorylation of mNdK. Surprisingly, cromoglycate, which is a known inhibitor of histidine phosphorylation (44Kowluru A. Biochem. Pharmacol. 2002; 63: 2091-2100Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar), had no significant effect (Fig. 2C, lanes 8 and 9). We further investigated the phosphotransfer activity of mNdK employing an enzyme-coupled assay using dGTP and ADP as donor and acceptor nucleotides, respectively. To determine the kinetic parameters, purified enzyme was incubated (up to 8 min at 24 °C) with increasing concentrations of ADP, and the activity was measured at every minute (Fig. 3, inset A shows a representative plot). The rate of reaction (amount of ATP generated/min) was calculated from the standard curve (see “Experimental Procedures”) and plotted as a function of substrate concentration. This yielded a typical Michaelis-Ment"
https://openalex.org/W1587653288,"Antibodies recognizing peptide bound to a major histocompatability complex (MHC) protein usually have a higher affinity for the composite peptide·MHC (pMHC) ligand than T cell receptors (TCR) with the same specificity. Because the solvent-accessible peptide area constitutes only a small portion of the contacting pMHC surface, we hypothesized that the contribution of the MHC moiety to the TCR-pMHC complex stability is limited, ensuring a small increment of the binding energy delivered by the peptide to be distinguishable by the TCR or the peptide-specific antibody. This suggests that the gain in affinity of the antibody-pMHC interaction can be achieved through an increase in the on-rate without a significant change in the off-rate of the interaction. To test the hypothesis, we have analyzed the binding of an ovalbumin peptide (pOV8) and its variants associated with soluble H-2Kb protein to the 25-D1.16 monoclonal antibody and compared it with the binding of the same pMHC complexes to the OT-1 TCR. This comparison revealed a substantially higher on-rate of the antibody-pMHC interaction compared with the TCR-pMHC interaction. In contrast, both the antibody and the TCR-pMHC complexes exhibited comparably fast off-rates. Sequencing of the 25-D1.16 VH and VL genes showed that they have very few somatic mutations and those occur mainly in framework regions. We propose that the above features constitute a signature of the recognition of MHC-bound peptide antigens by TCR and TCR-like antibodies, which could explain why the latter are rarely produced in vivo.

T cell antigen-specific receptors (TCR) 1The abbreviations used are: TCR, T cell receptor; MHC, major histocompatibility complex; pMHC, complex of antigenic peptide with MHC protein; mAb, monoclonal antibody; VH, variable domain of antibody heavy chain; VL, variable domain of antibody light chain; FR, framework regions; CLIP, class II invariant chain-associated peptide; CDR, complementary determining region.1The abbreviations used are: TCR, T cell receptor; MHC, major histocompatibility complex; pMHC, complex of antigenic peptide with MHC protein; mAb, monoclonal antibody; VH, variable domain of antibody heavy chain; VL, variable domain of antibody light chain; FR, framework regions; CLIP, class II invariant chain-associated peptide; CDR, complementary determining region. must recognize major histocompatibility complex (MHC) protein and at the same time discriminate between many different peptides bound to that MHC. Approximately 80% of the solvent-accessible area of the peptide is buried in the MHC binding groove (1Rudolph M.G. Wilson I.A. Curr. Opin. Immunol. 2002; 14: 52-65Crossref PubMed Scopus (246) Google Scholar), limiting the amount of energy that a peptide can contribute to the TCR-pMHC interaction. To ensure TCR specificity for the MHC-bound peptide, the amount of binding energy coming from the MHC moiety must be restricted, allowing the peptide contribution of the composite ligand to be distinguishable by the TCR. In accord with this idea, it has been found that only two to three residues of an MHC class I protein mediate critical TCR-MHC contacts (2Baker B.M. Turner R.V. Gagnon S.J. Wiley D.C. Biddison W.E. J. Exp. Med. 2001; 193: 551-562Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar, 3Wang Z. Turner R. Baker B.M. Biddison W.E. J. Immunol. 2002; 169: 3146-3154Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). In addition, experimentally measured values of the free energy for various TCR-pMHC interactions (4Willcox B. Gao G. Wyer J. Ladbury J. Bell J. Jakobsen B. van der Merwe P.

Biochemistry. 1978; 17: 2943-2948Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar, 10Stites W.E. Chem. Rev. 1997; 97: 1233-1250Crossref PubMed Scopus (429) Google Scholar). However, it has been shown that the TCR intrinsic affinity can be significantly increased without the loss of its specificity (11Holler P.D. Chlewicki L.K. Kranz D.M. Nat. Immunol. 2003; 4: 55-62Crossref PubMed Scopus (176) Google Scholar). The increase in the TCR affinity was mainly the result of the on-rate, not the off-rate, indicating that limited activation energy of the dissociation phase of the TCR-pMHC reaction is required to preserve the peptide specificity. This led us to suggest that, similar to the TCR with enhanced affinity, the apparent increase in the binding energy of pMHC-specific antibodies is achieved through a faster on-rate, without a significant change in the off-rate of the interaction. To test this hypothesis we analyzed the binding of an ovalbumin peptide, SIINFEKL (pOV8), and its variants with known biological activities (12Jameson S.C. Carbone F.R. Bevan M.J. J. Exp. Med. 1993; 177: 1541-1550Crossref PubMed Scopus (251) Google Scholar) in association with soluble Kb protein to the pOV8·Kb-specific monoclonal antibody (mAb) 25-D1.16 (13Porgador A. Yewdell J.W.

Comparison of the equilibrium and kinetic constants of OT-1 TCR and 25-D1.16 antibody binding parameters revealed that an increase in intrinsic affinity of antibody interactions with peptide·Kb complexes was mainly the result of changes in the on-rate but not the off-rate. We have also found very few somatic mutations in the variable domain of antibody heavy chain (VH) and light chain (VL) 25-D1.16 genes encoding this mAb, which appeared to be very similar to the corresponding germ line genes. Based on these data, we suggest that the above features are essential characteristics of the recognition of short peptides bound to MHC proteins by TCR and TCR-like antibodies. This knowledge improves our understanding of the specificity of recognition of pMHC ligands and may be useful for designing pMHC-specific reagents. It may also help to understand why pMHC-specific antibodies are usually selected from combinatorial libraries in vitro but are very rarely elicited in vitro in response to immunization in vivo. Peptides—Peptides were synthesized using Fmoc (N-(9-fluorenyl)methoxycarbonyl) chemistry by BioSynthesis (Lewisville, TX). Purity of the peptides was confirmed by high pressure liquid chromatography and mass spectrometric analyses. Peptides used were SIINFEKL, a chicken ovalbumin peptide (257–264) (pOV8), and its variants RGYNYEKL (V-OVA), EIINFEKL (E1), SAINFEKL (A2), SIIRFEKL (R4), and SIINFEDL (D7); RGYVYQGL, a vesicular stomatitis virus nucleo-capsid protein (52–59) peptide (VSV); FAPGNYPAL, a Sendai virus nucleoprotein (324–332) peptide (SV9); and KVVRFDKL, a chicken ovalbumin (55–62) peptide (KVDL). Soluble pOV8·Kb Complexes—The pRMHa-3 plasmids coding the H-2Kb extracellular domain of the H-2Kb with His6 tag at the C-terminal end and mouse β2-microglobulin were kindly provided by Anders Brunmark. These plasmids and a plasmid containing a neomycin resistance gene (Invitrogen) were co-transfected into Schneider cells (S2) by calcium phosphate precipitation, and stable transfectants were selected as described previously (16Brunmark A. Jackson M. Fernandez N. Butcher G. MHC. 2. Oxford University Press, Oxford1998: 53-78Google Scholar). The cells were expanded in serum-free medium Sf-900 II (Invitrogen) and grown to a density of 1.4–2.0 × 107 cells/ml. The expression H-2Kb had been induced by 1 μm cupric sulfate for 72 h, and soluble H-2Kb molecules were isolated from the culture supernatant essentially as described previously (8Anikeeva N. Lebedeva T. Krogsgaard M. Tetin S.Y. Martinez-Hackert E. Kalams S.A. Davis M.M. Sykulev Y. Biochemistry. 2003; 42: 4709-4716Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar, 17Anikeeva N. Lebedeva T. Sumaroka M. Kalams S.A. Sykulev Y. J. Immunol. Methods. 2003; 277: 75-86Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). Soluble, “empty” H-2Kb protein was loaded with peptides of interest. Typically, 50 μg of peptide in 5 μl of Me2SO was added to 1.2 mg of H2-Kb in 250 μl of phosphate-buffered saline, pH 7.4, and the reaction mixture was incubated at room temperature (22–24 °C) overnight. The peptide·MHC complexes were stored in the presence of peptide excess at 4 °C. Gel filtration of the peptide·Kb complexes on a Sephacryl S200 HiPrep 16/60 column (Amersham Biosciences) did not reveal the presence of aggregates in the samples. Purification of 25-D1.16 Antibody and Fab Fragment—Murine hybridoma 25-D1.16 secreting an IgG1κ mAb specific for the pOV8·H-2Kb complex (13Porgador A. Yewdell J.W. Deng Y. Bennink J.R. Germain R.N. Immunity. 1997; 6: 715-726Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (584) Google Scholar) was kindly provided by Drs. Germain and Porgador. The hybridoma was grown in serum-free high glucose Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium/Ham's F-12 medium (1:1) supplemented with l-glutamine, sodium pyruvate, β-mercaptoethanol, vitamins, essential and non-essential amino acids, l-ascorbic acid, and SPITE (Sigma) (18Markvicheva E.A. Kuptsova S.V. Mareeva T.Y. Vikhrov A.A. Dugina T.N. Strukova S.M. Belokon Y.N. Kochetkov K.A. Baranova E.N. Zubov V.P. Poncelet D. Rumsh L.D. Appl. Biochem. Biotechnol. 2000; 88: 145-157Crossref Google Scholar). The monoclonal antibody 25-D1.16 was purified from culture supernatant by affinity chromatography on protein G-agarose. Fab fragment was produced by papain digestion and purified on a MonoQ anion exchange column (Amersham Biosciences). The identity of purified Fab fragment was confirmed by SDS-PAGE and enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay with soluble pOV8·Kb ligand. N-terminal Sequencing of mAb 25-D1.16 Heavy and Light Chains— Partial N-terminal amino acid sequences of mAb 25-D1.16 heavy and light chains were determined by Edman degradation on a PROCISE-cLC (Applied Biosystems) sequencer. The heavy chain of the mAb contains glutamine at the N terminus that cyclizes to pyroglutamic acid precluding sequencing. To remove pyroglutamic acid, 25-D1.16 mAb was treated with pyroglutamate aminopeptidase from Pyrococcus furiosus (Takara Biotechnology) essentially as described previously (19Mozdzanowski J. Bongers J. Anumula K. Anal. Biochem. 1998; 260: 183-187Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). 8.5 mg of dithiothreitol and 300 mg of guanidine chloride (final concentration approximately 3 m) were added to 0.5 ml of the antibody (2 mg/ml) in 0.35 m Tris-HCl, pH 8.5, and incubated under argon at 60 °C for 90 min. After cooling to room temperature, solid sodium iodoacetate (28 mg) was added to the reaction, and the mixture was incubated in the dark for 45 min at room temperature. The reaction was terminated by the addition of 5 mg of solid dithiothreitol. The reduced/carboxymethylated mAb 25-D1.16 was dialyzed against 100 mm sodium phosphate buffer, pH 8.0, containing 2 mm EDTA overnight at 4 °C, and the protein concentration was adjusted to 1 mg/ml. 5 μl of glycerol, 5 μl of pyroglutamate aminopeptidase from P. furiosus stock solution (0.2 units/ml) in 1× reaction buffer (50 mm sodium phosphate buffer, pH 7.0, containing 10 mm dithiothreitol and 1 mm EDTA), and 25 μl of 5× reaction buffer were added to 0.1 mg of reduced/carboxymethylated IgG, and the mixture was incubated at 37 °C for 24 h. The heavy and light chains of deblocked 25-D1.16 mAb were separated by SDS-12% PAGE at reducing conditions, blotted onto polyvinylidene difluoride membrane, and stained by Coomassie Blue G-250. The protein bands corresponding to heavy (50 kDa) and light (25 kDa) chains were excised, and 10 and 30 cycles, respectively, of Edman sequencing were performed on each sample. Cloning and Sequencing of VH and VL Genes—Total RNA was extracted from 5 × 106 hybridoma 25-D1.16 cells using the RNeasy Mini kit (Qiagen). Approximately 5 μg of total RNA was reverse transcribed in a reaction volume of 20 μl using 200 units of SuperScript II RNase H– reverse transcriptase (Invitrogen) and 13 pmol of oligo(dT)18 primer according to the manufacturer's (Invitrogen) protocol. PCR amplification was carried out using Taq DNA/polymerase (Eppendorf). The VH gene was amplified with 5′-ATG GGA TGG AGC TGG ATC TTT CTC-3′ (HFOR) and 5′-CTC AAT TTT CTT GTC CAC CTT GGT GC-3′ (HBACK) primers, whereas the light chain variable region (VL) gene was amplified with 5′-ATG AAG TTT CCT TCT CAA CTT CTG CTC-3′ (LFOR) and 5′-CTA ACA CTC ATT CCT GTT GAA GCT CTT GAC-3′ (LBACK) primers. The amplified fragments were inserted into the pGEM-T Easy vector (Promega) and transformed into competent Escherichia coli JM109 cells. Transformants were selected by α-complementation screening, and plasmid DNA from several positive clones was purified. Sequencing of cDNA was performed by BigDye terminator reaction on an ABI PRISM 377 DNA sequencer (Applied Biosystems). Binding of Peptide·Kb Complexes to 25-D1.16 Antibody—Analysis of the interaction between 25-D1.16 mAb and soluble peptide·Kb complexes was performed on a model 3000 Biosensor (Biacore, AB). The antibody 25-D1.16 in 10 mm acetic buffer, pH 5.0, was covalently immobilized to the surface of sensor chip CM5 by amine coupling to obtain a surface density of 100–400 resonance units. In the control flow cell, polyclonal mouse antibodies were immobilized at the same level and were used as a negative control. Before experiments were performed, peptide·Kb complexes were transferred to HBS-EP buffer (10 mm HEPES, pH 7.4, 0.15 m NaCl, 3 mm EDTA, 0.005% surfactant P20 (Biacore, AB)) using Micro BioSpin 6 columns (Bio-Rad). Soluble peptide·Kb complexes were injected into the flow cells at concentrations ranging from 50 to 3000 nm and a flow rate of 30 μl/min at 25 °C. Six different analyte concentrations were used. Binding of analyte (peptide·Kb complexes) was measured by surface plasmon resonance with association and dissociation times of 1 and 2 min, respectively. Injection mode KINJECT, optimized for kinetic measurements, was used in all experiments. To regenerate the surface, 0.1 m glycine-HCl, pH 2.2, was applied for a contact time of 0.5 min at a flow rate of 90 μl/min. The response curve of each analyte sample on the control surface was subtracted from the corresponding experimental curve. Analysis of the binding kinetics and calculations of the rate constants of association (ka) and dissociation (kd) were performed using BIAevaluation version 4.1 software. No differences in calculated values of ka and kd were observed in control experiments, in which reduced surface densities of immobilized mAb 25-D1.16 were used, showing that the interactions were not limited by mass transfer. Values of ka and kd were determined as averages of at least two independent measurements. Thermodynamic Analysis—The free energy of binding (Gibbs energy) was calculated from the value of the equilibrium binding constant Keq,ΔG=−RTlnKeq(eq.1) where R is the universal gas constant (R = 1.987 cal K–1 mol–1) and T is the temperature (in degrees K). The difference in free energy between OT-1 and 25-D1.16 binding to pOV8 and the other peptide·Kb complexes was determined as shown in Equation 2.ΔΔG=ΔG(pOV8−Kb)−ΔG(peptide−Kb)(eq.2) The contribution of the association (ΔGan) and dissociation (ΔGdn) phases of the interactions was determined from the Eyring equation (20Eisenberg D. Crothers D. Physical Chemistry with Applications to the Life Sciences. Benjamin/Cummings Publishing Co., Menlo Park, CA1979: 242-243Google Scholar), lnk=ln{(kBTκ)/−(h/2π)}−ΔGn/RT (eq.3) where k is the reaction rate constant of association or dissociation, kB = 3.3 × 10–24 cal K–1 and h/2π = 1.586 × 10–34 cal s are the Boltzmann and the Planck constants, respectively, and κ is the transmission coefficient. Because the κ value is not known, actual values of ΔGan and ΔGdn are difficult to determine; here we assume that the κ value is similar for both reactions. Differences in energy contributions of ΔGan and ΔGdn to the binding energy between OT-1 and 25-D1.16 interactions with various peptide·Kb complexes were calculated as shown in Equations 4 and 5.ΔΔGa=ΔGan(25-D1.16)−ΔGan(OT-1)(eq.4) ΔΔGd=ΔGdn(25-D1.16)−ΔGdn(OT-1)(eq.5) Analysis of VH and VL Sequences—The nucleotide sequences obtained for the V region genes encoding 25-D1.16 mAb V domains are shown in Fig. 1. Sequence analysis of the VH region (Fig. 1A) (GenBank™ accession no. AY704180) shows that it shares 98.6% sequence identity with the germ line gene J558.6. Comparison of the two genes revealed four base pair changes, of which two are silent mutations located in the framework regions (FR)-H1 and FR-H3, and two others are located within FR-H3, resulting in the replacement of Thr-77 with Ala and Leu-82 with Val, respectively. The CDR-H3 comprises five codons contributed by the D gene segment D-SP2.7 used in reading frame 3 and the JH3 segment (Fig. 1B). No mutations are present in the sequence contributed by D-SP2.7 and JH3. Alignment of the mature VH gene and corresponding germ line gene segments shows four nucleotide insertions at the V-D junction and two nucleotide insertions at the D-J junction. This results in the appearance of Lys-95 and Phe-100A. Sequence analysis of the VL region showed that it is a κ chain. The VL gene segment of 25-D1.16 exhibits 98.2% homology with the AJ231273 germ line sequence belonging to the Vκ33 family (Fig. 1C) (GenBank™ accession no. AY704179) and is joined to the Jκ5 segment (Fig. 1D). Five base pair differences were found with the germ line sequence, of which two are silent mutations. The others resulted in amino acid replacements in FR-L1 (Met-4 to Val) and FR-L3 (Gly-68 to Arg and Ser-74 to Ile). No mutations were present in the sequence contributed by Jκ5. CDRs of the 25-D1.16 mAb and the OT-1 TCR—Based on x-ray crystallographic analysis, CDRs of heavy and light chains of Ig molecules can be described in term of known canonical structures (21Al-Lazikani B. Lesk A.M. Chothia C. J. Mol. Biol. 1997; 273: 927-948Crossref PubMed Scopus (578) Google Scholar, 22Morea V. Tramontano A. Rustici M. Chothia C. Lesk A.M. J. Mol. Biol. 1998; 275: 269-294Crossref PubMed Scopus (301) Google Scholar). The conformation of a particular canonical structure is determined by the length of the loop and the nature of amino acid residues at key positions. This conformation is conserved despite different positioning of the canonical loops relative to the framework regions. The structure of the hypervariable regions -H1, -H2, -L1, and -L2 of mAb 25-D1.16 (Fig. 2) suggests that they belong to canonical classes 1, 2A, 2B, and 1, respectively (21Al-Lazikani B. Lesk A.M. Chothia C. J. Mol. Biol. 1997; 273: 927-948Crossref PubMed Scopus (578) Google Scholar). The CDR-H3 that is expected to contact MHC-bound peptide is much more variable and is not included in the canonical structure description (22Morea V. Tramontano A. Rustici M. Chothia C. Lesk A.M. J. Mol. Biol. 1998; 275: 269-294Crossref PubMed Scopus (301) Google Scholar), whereas CDR-L3 belongs to canonical class 1. The primary structures of the CDRs of the OT-1 and 25-D1.16 mAb are shown in Fig. 2. They appear to be very different, indicating that CDRs with divergent sequences may determine very similar specificities for pMHC binding (see below). Binding Interactions of the 25-D1.16 mAb to Various Peptide·Kb Complexes—Fig. 3 shows specific binding of the soluble pOV8·Kb complex to the 25-D1.16 mAb immobilized on a biosensor surface. The binding of two irrelevant peptide·Kb complexes containing either Sendai virus peptide (SV9) or peptide from vesicular stomatitis virus was undetectable (not shown). The values of kinetic and equilibrium (affinity) constants for the 25-D1.16 mAb binding to pOV8·Kb and variant peptide·Kb complexes with defined biological activities measured at 25 °C are summarized in Table I. Because the mAb was immobilized on the biosensor surface, soluble monovalent pOV8·Kb complexes bound to the antibody-binding sites independently, allowing measurements of intrinsic parameters of the interaction. This was confirmed by measuring binding of the antibody monovalent Fab fragment to pOV8·Kb immobilized on the biosensor surface (data not shown).Table IBinding parameters of various peptide·KbHalf-life time of the receptor. pMHC complex, i.e. t1/2 = 0.693/kd. complexes to the OT-1 TCR and to the 25-D.1.16 mAbBinding parametersPeptideaPeptides used were: pOV8, SIINFEKL; E1, EIINFEKL; R4, SIIRFEKL, D7, SIINFEDL; V-OVA, RGYNYEKL; KVDL, KVVRFDKL; A2, SAINFEKL; SV9, FAPGNYPAL; VSV, RGYVYQGL.pOV8SV9VSVE1R4D7V-OVAKVDLA225.D-1.16 antibodyka (m-1 s-1)2.9 ± 0.1 × 104NMfNM, not measurable.NM3.2 ± 0.3 × 1041.2 ± 0.2 × 104NM5.4 ± 0.1 × 1043.4 ± 0.3 × 1042.8 ± 0.1 × 104kd (s-1)7.6 ± 0.3 × 10-3NMNM5.2 ± 0.1 × 10-33.8 ± 0.3 × 10-2NM1.3 ± 0.1 × 10-21.8 ± 0.2 × 10-26.2 ± 0.1 × 10-3t1/2 (s)bHalf-life time of the receptor. pMHC complex, i.e. t1/2 = 0.693/kd.91133185339112Keq (m-1)cReaction equilibrium binding constant, Keq, was determined as ka/kd ratio.3.9 × 1066.1 × 1060.32 × 106<104gThe binding of D7-Kb to 25-D.1.16 immobilized on the biosensor surface was to too weak to measure; Keq of this interaction was estimated to be less than 104m-1.4.1 × 1061.9 × 1064.6 × 106ΔG (cal/mol)dThe free energy of binding (Gibbs energy), ΔG, i.e. ΔG = -RT ln Keq-8955-9218-7479<-5434-8984-8530-9052ΔΔG (cal/mol)eThe difference in the free binding energy, i.e. ΔΔG, of receptor-pMHC interactions caused by replacement of Kb-bound pOV8 to indicated peptides.263-1476>-3521N 29-42597OT-1 TCRhThe binding parameters of OT-1 TCR to indicated peptide·Kb complexes were determined previously by biosensor technology (14) and are presented for comparison.ka (m-1 s-1)3.1 ± 0.1 × 103NMNM3.0 ± 0.3 × 1032.56 ± 0.04 × 103NDiND, not determined.1.3 ± 0.3 × 103ND4.8 ± 0.8 × 103jThese values have been published previously (15).kd (s-1)2.0 ± 0.1 × 10-2NMNM6.8 ± 0.4 × 10-21.5 ± 0.1 × 10-1ND3.9 ± 0.5 × 10-2ND2.0 ± 0.3 × 10-2t1/2 (s)3510.24.617.834.7Keq (m-1)15.5 × 1044.4 × 1041.8 × 104ND3.3 × 10424 × 104ΔG (cal/mol)-7055-6312-5785-6142-7314ΔΔG (cal/mol)-743-1270-913259a Peptides used were: pOV8, SIINFEKL; E1, EIINFEKL; R4, SIIRFEKL, D7, SIINFEDL; V-OVA, RGYNYEKL; KVDL, KVVRFDKL; A2, SAINFEKL; SV9, FAPGNYPAL; VSV, RGYVYQGL.b Half-life time of the receptor. pMHC complex, i.e. t1/2 = 0.693/kd.c Reaction equilibrium binding constant, Keq, was determined as ka/kd ratio.d The free energy of binding (Gibbs energy), ΔG, i.e. ΔG = -RT ln Keqe The difference in the free binding energy, i.e. ΔΔG, of receptor-pMHC interactions caused by replacement of Kb-bound pOV8 to indicated peptides.f NM, not measurable.g The binding of D7-Kb to 25-D.1.16 immobilized on the biosensor surface was to too weak to measure; Keq of this interaction was estimated to be less than 104m-1.h The binding parameters of OT-1 TCR to indicated peptide·Kb complexes were determined previously by biosensor technology (14Alam S.M.

Open table in a new tab Derivation of the ka and kd values using a 1:1 Langmuir binding model demonstrated a good correlation between the experimental and globally fitted data (χ2 = 0.05). The equilibrium binding constant Keq was calculated from the ratio ka/kd. For a two-step reaction, Keq measured from the maximum (plateau) binding response is expected to be different from the Keq value measured by the ka/kd ratio, suggesting a complex mechanism of the reaction (23Wu L.C. Tuot D.S. Lyons D.S. Garcia K.C. Davis M.M. Nature. 2002; 418: 552-556Crossref PubMed Scopus (234) Google Scholar, 24Gakamsky D.M. Luescher I.F. Pecht I. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Very often, however, the intermediate complex of the reaction is short lived, and the difference between the two Keq values is not significant (25Schreiber G. Curr. Opin. Struct. Biol. 2002; 12: 41-47Crossref PubMed Scopus (259) Google Scholar). We did not investigate this issue in detail here and used the Keq value determined from the ratio ka/kd to compare it with corresponding data measured for the binding of the same pMHC complexes to the OT-1 TCR (14Alam S.M. Travers P.J. Wung J.L. Nasholds W. Redpath S. Jameson S.C. Gascoigne N.R. Nature. 1996; 381: 616-620Crossref PubMed Scopus (539) Google Scholar). Comparison of the Specificity of the OT-1 TCR with the 25-D1.16 mAb—To compare the specificity of 25-D1.16 mAb with OT-1 TCR, we analyzed binding to peptide·Kb complexes in which biological activity (12Jameson S.C.

Immunity. 1999; 10: 227-237Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (186) Google Scholar) were determined previously. The ka value of mAb 25-D1.16 binding to pOV8·Kb was 2.9 × 104m–1 s–1, 1 order of magnitude higher than the ka value for the OT-1 TCR-pOV8·Kb interactions, although the difference in rate constant of dissociation for the two reactions was only approximately 3-fold (Table I). Thus, the gain in the free energy of the 25-D1.16-pOV8·Kb interaction is primarily determined by an increase in on-rate but not by a decrease in off-rate. This suggests that the activation energy of the dissociation phase of the antibody-pMHC interaction is only slightly higher than that of the TCR-pMHC interaction. Amino acid substitutions in MHC-bound peptide had an effect on the recognition of pOV8·Kb by the OT-1 TCR that was similar to the 25-D1.16 mAb. For instance, the R4·Kb complex, which induces positive selection of immature OT-1+ thymocytes (26Hogquist K.A. Jameson S.C. Heath W.R. Howard J.L. Bevan M.J. Carbone F.R. Cell. 1994; 76: 17-27Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2222) Google Scholar) and antagonizes cytolytic activity of mature OT-1 cytotoxic T lymphocytes (12Jameson S.C. Carbone F.R. Bevan M.J. J. Exp. Med. 1993; 177: 1541-1550Crossref PubMed Scopus (251) Google Scholar), bound to the 25-D1.16 mAb with lower affinity as it did to the OT-1 TCR (Table I). In both cases, the loss of the free binding energy was caused by a faster off-rate, whereas changes in the on-rate were marginal. Similarly, the Kb complex with V-OVA peptide, which shares solvent-accessible amino acid residues with pOV8 and has biological activity similar to R4 (12Jameson S.C. Carbone F.R. Bevan M.J. J. Exp."

Proteins of both families promote receptor oligomerization, activation of the Janus kinase (JAK)/STAT pathway, and transcription of many genes, including the suppressor of cytokine signaling (SOCS) family. In this study, we show that chemokine-mediated SOCS1 and SOCS3 up-regulation modulates the signaling and function associated to a cytokine receptor, both in vitro and in vivo. The effect is mediated by SOCS binding to JAK2 and to the cytokine receptor, which blocks subsequent signaling events. The data reinforce the premise of cytokine-chemokine cross-talk, which helps contribute to modulating individual responses and in defining the functional plasticity of the immune system.

Baixeras E. Mol. Cell. Endocrinol. 2002; 188: 1-7Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar). Indeed, bovine growth hormone-transgenic mice show reduced B cell lymphopoiesis, reduced myelopoiesis in fetal liver, and virtual absence of myelopoiesis in bone marrow (7Gonzalo J.A. Mazuchelli R. Mellado M. Frade J.M. Carrera A.C. von Kobbe C. Merida I. Martínez A.C. J. Immunol. 1996; 157: 3298-3304PubMed Google Scholar). Growth hormone effects are mediated directly or indirectly through induction and release of insulin-like growth factor-1 (IGF-1) (8Woelfle J. Chia D.J. Rotwein P. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 51261-51266Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar). GH exerts its biological effects by binding to its receptor (GHR), a member of the cytokine receptor superfamily (9Herrington J. Carter-Su C. Trends Endocrinol. Metab. 2001; 12: 252-257Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (278) Google Scholar); this results in receptor dimerization and tyrosine phosphorylation of an associated Janus kinase (JAK2). Activated JAK2 in turn phosphorylates the intracellular domain of the GHR, and the GHR-JAK2 complex provides docking sites for a variety of signaling molecules of the signal transducer and activator of transcription family (STAT) (9Herrington J. Carter-Su C. Trends Endocrinol. Metab. 2001; 12: 252-257Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (278) Google Scholar, 10Zhu T. Goh E.L. Graichen R. Ling L. Lobie P.E. Cell Signal. 2001; 13: 599-616Crossref PubMed Scopus (221) Google Scholar). GH activates mainly STAT5, and to a lesser degree, STAT3 and STAT1. After phosphorylation, the STATs form dimers, translocate to the nucleus, and bind to DNA, triggering gene transcription (11Herrington J. Smit L.S. Schwartz J. Carter-Su C. Oncogene. 2000; 19: 2585-2597Crossref PubMed Scopus (226) Google Scholar). Some cytokine actions differ, depending on signal persistence. JAK/STAT pathway activation is generally transient and cell type-dependent. Negative regulation is exerted by tyrosine phosphatases such as SHP-2 (12Yin T. Shen R. Feng G.S. Yang Y.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 1032-1037Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar) and by SOCS proteins, either by direct interaction with activated JAK or with cytokine receptors (13Naka T. Narazaki M. Hirata M. Matsumoto T. Minamoto S. Aono A. Nishimoto N. Kajita T. Taga T. Yoshizaki K. Akira S. Kishimoto T.

SOCSs also have a regulatory role in other receptor systems, including the IGF-1 (16Dey B.R. Furlanetto R.W. Nissley P. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2000; 278: 38-43Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar) and chemokine receptors (17Soriano S.F. Hernanz-Falcón P. Rodríguez-Frade J.M. Martín de Ana A. Garzón R. Carvalho-Pinto C.

Immunity. 2000; 13: 287-290Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar). Chemokines comprise a large family of low molecular mass (8–10 kDa) cytokines, with chemotactic and proactivatory effects on different leukocyte lineages (19Mackay C.R. Nat. Immunol. 2001; 2: 95-101Crossref PubMed Scopus (715) Google Scholar). Several studies established the central role of chemokines in a number of physiological situations, including T helper cell responses, hematopoiesis, angiogenesis, and homeostasis, as well as in processes such as asthma, tumor rejection, human immunodeficiency virus-1 (HIV-1) infection, and arteriosclerosis (20Gerard C. Rollins B.J. Nat. Immunol. 2001; 2: 108-115Crossref PubMed Scopus (1211) Google Scholar, 21Moser B. Loetscher P. Nat.

CXCL12 was isolated from stromal cell culture supernatants (23Bleul C.C. Fuhlbrigge R.C. Casasnovas J.M. Aiuti A. Springer T.A. J. Exp.

In contrast to proinflammatory chemokines, CXCL12 is constitutively produced in many organs, including human bone marrow, suggesting a major role for CXCL12/CXCR4 interactions in steady-state homeostatic processes such as controlling leukocyte trafficking and retaining undifferentiating and maturing hematopoietic cells within the bone marrow. Embryos of mice lacking either the CXCL12 protein (24Nagasawa T. Hirota S. Tachibana K. Takakura N. Nishikawa S. Kitamura Y. Yoshida N. Kikutani H. Kishimoto T.

Chemokines mediate their biological effects by binding to specific receptors, members of the seven-transmembrane domain G protein-coupled receptor family. After binding, chemokines trigger receptor dimerization, association to, and activation of JAK in a process that is central to chemokine function. JAK in turn phosphorylates the chemokine receptors on tyrosine residues and activates STAT transcription factors (30Mellado M. Rodriguez-Frade J.M. Manes S. Martínez A.-C. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 2001; 19: 397-421Crossref PubMed Scopus (299) Google Scholar). We recently showed that CXCL12-induced STAT activation leads to SOCS3 up-regulation and interference with chemokine signaling and function (17Soriano S.F. Hernanz-Falcón P. Rodríguez-Frade J.M. Martín de Ana A. Garzón R. Carvalho-Pinto C. Vila-Coro A.J. Zaballos A. Balomenos D. Martínez A.-C. Mellado M. J. Exp. Med. 2002; 196: 311-321Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). Here we show that GH-mediated JAK/STAT pathway activation is blocked in cells pretreated with chemokines. CXCL12-mediated up-regulation of SOCS1 and SOCS3 is linked to inhibition of GH-mediated responses both in vitro and in vivo. These data and previous observations are discussed in the context of cytokine-chemokine cross-talk, a two-way mechanism that modulates the biological functions of these protein families that coincide in many physiopathological settings. Biological Materials and Antibodies—IM9 cells were from the American Type Culture Collection (CCL159). Antibodies included anti-CXCR4 (CXCR4-01) (31Vila-Coro A.J. Rodríguez-Frade J.M. Martín De Ana A. Moreno-Ortíz M.C. Martínez A.-C. Mellado M. FASEB J. 1999; 13: 1699-1710Crossref PubMed Scopus (442) Google Scholar) and anti-hGH receptor (hGHR-05) mAb generated in our laboratory (32Mellado M. Rodriguez-Frade J.M. Kremer L. Martínez A.-C. J. Clin. Endocrinol. Metab. 1996; 81: 1613-1618PubMed Google Scholar), rabbit anti-JAK2 (Upstate Biotechnology, Lake Placid, NY), rabbit anti-PTyr (Promega, Madison, WI), and rabbit anti-STAT5b, goat anti-SOCS1, and rabbit anti-SOCS3 (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Santa Cruz, CA). Recombinant hGH (Genotonorm) was from Amersham Biosciences. Flow Cytometry Analysis—Cells were centrifuged (250 × g, 10 min, room temperature), plated in V-bottom 96-well plates (2.5 × 105 cells/well), and incubated with biotin-labeled GH (1 μg/100 μl/well) followed by fluorescein isothiocyanate (FITC)-labeled streptavidin (Southern Biotechnology) (30 min, 4 °C). When mAbs were used, cells were incubated as above with biotin-hGHR-05 (1 μg/50 μl/well, 60 min, 4 °C) or biotin-CXCR4-01 (1 μg/50 μl/well). Cells were washed twice in PBS with 2% bovine serum albumin and 2% fetal calf serum and then centrifuged (250 × g, 5 min, 4 °C). FITC-labeled streptavidin was added (30 min, 4 °C), and cell-bound fluorescence was determined in a Profile XL flow cytometer at 525 nm (Coulter, Miami, FL). When necessary, cell cycle status was measured by cellular DNA staining with propidium iodide followed by cytometric determination as above. Immunoprecipitation, SDS-PAGE, and Western Blot Analysis—After serum depletion (60 min, 37 °C in RPMI containing 0.1% bovine serum albumin), IM9 cells were CXCL12-treated (50 nm, 60 min, 37 °C) prior to stimulation with GH (10 μg/ml). Cells were lysed in detergent buffer (10 mm triethanolamine, pH 8.0, 150 mm NaCl, 1 nm EDTA, 10% glycerol, 2% digitonin, with 10 μm sodium orthovanadate, 10 μg/ml leupeptin, and 10 μg/ml aprotinin; 30 min, 4 °C, continuous rocking) and then centrifuged (15,000 × g, 15 min). Immunoprecipitation was as described (31Vila-Coro A.J. Rodríguez-Frade J.M. Martín De Ana A. Moreno-Ortíz M.C. Martínez A.-C. Mellado M. FASEB J. 1999; 13: 1699-1710Crossref PubMed Scopus (442) Google Scholar). Precipitates or protein extracts were separated in SDS-PAGE and transferred to nitrocellulose membranes. Western blot analysis was as described (31Vila-Coro A.J. Rodríguez-Frade J.M. Martín De Ana A. Moreno-Ortíz M.C. Martínez A.-C. Mellado M. FASEB J. 1999; 13: 1699-1710Crossref PubMed Scopus (442) Google Scholar), using 3% bovine serum albumin in Trissaline buffer as a blocking agent for anti-phosphotyrosine analyses. For stripping, membranes were incubated (60 min, 60 °C) with 62.5 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.8, containing 2% SDS and 0.5% β-mercaptoethanol. Protein loading was controlled using a protein detection kit (Pierce) and by reprobing the membrane with the immunoprecipitating antibody. When necessary, splenocytes from untreated and CXCL12-treated mice were extracted and activated in vitro with GH (10 μg/ml, 37 °C) for different periods of time before processing. In Vivo Assays to Determine the GH Biological Activity—One-month-old BALB/c mice received an intrasplenic injection of CXCL12 (1 μg in 75 μl of sterile PBS) or PBS. Mice were sacrificed 60 min after injection, and splenocytes were extracted and activated in vitro with GH (10 μg/ml, 37 °C). In other experiments, mice received an intravenous injection of CXCL12 (1 μg in 200 μl of sterile PBS) or PBS. After 60 min, mice received an intravenous injection of GH (0.1 μgin100 μl of sterile PBS). Blood, spleen, and liver were extracted at different times for later analysis. Quantification of IGF-1 Serum Levels—Blood was collected at different times after GH injection from the retro-orbital sinus of mice stimulated as above. After acid-ethanol extraction of IGF-1-binding proteins (IGFBP) (33Daughaday W.H. Mariz I.K. Blethen S.L. J. Clin. Endocrinol. Metab. 1980; 51: 781-788Crossref PubMed Scopus (702) Google Scholar), serum IGF-1 levels were measured in a radioimmunoassay using polyclonal anti-IGF-1 antibody (Gropep, Adelaide, Australia) and rhIGF-1 (Amersham Biosciences and Kabi Peptide Hormones, Stockholm, Sweden) as a standard. To avoid interference from the remaining IGFBP-coupled IGF after extraction, a truncated 125I-des(1–3) IGF-1 (Amersham Biosciences and Kabi Peptide Hormones) was used as tracer (34Bang P. Eriksson U. Sara V. Wivall I.L. Hall K. Acta Endocrinol. (Copenh.). 1991; 124: 620-629Crossref PubMed Scopus (303) Google Scholar). Northern Blot Analysis—Total spleen and liver RNA from 4-week-old BALB/c mice, treated with CXCL12 (1 μg/ml, 60 min) or PBS, were extracted using Tri reagent (Sigma). RNA samples were resolved on denaturing formaldehyde-agarose gels and transferred to nylon membrane (Hybond N+; Amersham Biosciences). Membranes were hybridized with 32P-labeled cDNA from pEF-FLAG-I/mSOCS1, /mSOCS3, and β-actin (17Soriano S.F. Hernanz-Falcón P. Rodríguez-Frade J.M. Martín de Ana A. Garzón R. Carvalho-Pinto C. Vila-Coro A.J. Zaballos A. Balomenos D. Martínez A.-C. Mellado M. J. Exp. Med. 2002; 196: 311-321Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). In some cases, mice received intravenous injections of CXCL12 (1 μg in 200 μl of sterile PBS) or PBS followed by an intravenous injection of GH (0.1 μg in 100 μl of sterile PBS); spleen and liver were extracted, and total RNA was processed as above. Membranes were hybridized with 32P-labeled cDNA from pGEM-mIGF-1 exon 4, pGEM-rIGFBP3, and β-actin. Data were quantified using ImageJ software and expressed as a percentage of the optical density (OD) of the specific band as compared with that of controls. IGFBP3 Analysis by Ligand Blot—Mice received CXCL12 or PBS injections as above followed 60 min later by an intravenous injection of GH (0.1 μg in 100 μl of sterile PBS); 1 h later, they were bled from the retro-orbital sinus, and serum IGFBP-3 was analyzed in Western ligand blot as described (35Hossenlopp P. Seutin D. Segovia-Quinson B. Hardouin S. Binoux M. Anal. Biochem. 1986; 154: 138-143Crossref PubMed Scopus (1199) Google Scholar). In brief, 1.5 μl of serum was treated with 2× SDS loading buffer containing Tris (0.5 m, pH 6.8), glycerol (68% v/v), and SDS (2% w/v) and then electrophoresed on 15% SDS-polyacrylamide gels under non-reducing conditions. Proteins were transferred to nitrocellulose and treated sequentially with Tris (0.1 m) pH 7.4 buffer containing NaCl (0.15 m), 3% (v/v) Nonidet P-40, and 1% (w/v) bovine serum albumin and then probed overnight with 125I-labeled IGF-1 and IGF-II (106 cpm each/sheet). After extensive washing in buffer containing 0.1% (v/v) Tween 20, the nitrocellulose was autoradiographed with Kodak X-omat AR film (4–8 days, –70 °C). Human serum (1.5 μl) was included as a positive control. When necessary, data were quantified using ImageJ software and expressed as the area of the spot (arbitrary units). CXCL12 Modulates GH-mediated Function and Affects Circulating IGF-1 Levels—GH binding to its target cell triggers production of IGF-1 (8Woelfle J. Chia D.J. Rotwein P. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 51261-51266Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar), the main mediator of GH function. We observed that an intravenous injection of GH (1 μg/ml) into 4-week-old BALB/c mice triggered an increase in serum IGF-1 levels, as determined by radioimmunoassay (maximum effect at 60 min after GH injection) (Fig. 1A). The data concur with up-regulation of IGF-1 mRNA levels in the liver of GH-treated animals (Fig. 1B). Nonetheless, animals that received an intravenous injection of the chemokine CXCL12 (50 nm) 60 min prior to GH treatment showed neither IGF-1 mRNA up-regulation nor modification of circulating IGF-1 levels (Fig. 1, A and B). GH is reported to increase circulating IGFBP-3 levels (36Beauloye V. Muaku S.M. Lause P. Portetelle D. Renaville R. Robert A.R. Ketelslegers J.M. Maiter D. Am. J. Physiol. 1999; 277: E308-E315PubMed Google Scholar); CXCL12 pretreatment also abrogated GH-induced up-regulation of IGFBP-3, as shown by the determination of IGFBP-3 mRNA levels in the liver of treated mice (Fig. 1C). This was confirmed by ligand blot analysis of sera from untreated and CXCL12-treated mice (Fig. 1D). We previously showed GH-mediated modulation of chemokine responses based on SOCS3 up-regulation (17Soriano S.F. Hernanz-Falcón P. Rodríguez-Frade J.M. Martín de Ana A. Garzón R. Carvalho-Pinto C. Vila-Coro A.J. Zaballos A. Balomenos D. Martínez A.-C. Mellado M. J. Exp. Med. 2002; 196: 311-321Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). SOCS3 binding to CXCR4 blocks activation of the CXCR4-triggered signaling cascade and its function. To evaluate whether a similar mechanism could explain the effect of CXCL12 on GH function, we used the human B cell line IM9, which endogenously co-expresses CXCR4 and GHR as analyzed by flow cytometry with biotin-anti-CXCR4 or -GHR mAb followed by FITC-streptavidin (Fig. 2A).Fig. 2CXCL12 treatment alters GH-mediated early signaling events in IM9 cells. A, CXCR4 and GHR levels were measured by flow cytometry in IM9 cells incubated with biotin-labeled hGHR-05 or CXCR4 mAb followed by FITC-streptavidin. mAb binding is compared with that of negative controls. B, untreated or CXCL12-treated IM9 cells were GH-stimulated for the time indicated and then lysed. Lysates were immunoprecipitated with anti-PTyr, and the Western blot was developed with anti-JAK2 antibody. Mr, molecular mass; i.s., intrasplenic. C, IM9 cell lysates as in B were immunoprecipitated with anti-PTyr and developed with anti-STAT5b antibody.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) CXCL12 Treatment Alters GH-mediated Early Signaling Events—GH-induced SOCS3 up-regulation is mediated by activation of the JAK2/STAT5 pathway (9Herrington J. Carter-Su C. Trends Endocrinol. Metab. 2001; 12: 252-257Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (278) Google Scholar). We evaluated the effect of CXCL12 treatment on GH-mediated JAK2/STAT5 activation in IM9 cells. Untreated or CXCL12-treated (50 nm, 60 min, 37 °C) IM9 cells were activated with GH (10 μg/ml, 37 °C). Cells were lysed, immunoprecipitated with anti-PTyr polyclonal antibody, and analyzed in Western blot with anti-JAK2 antibody (Fig. 2B) or precipitated with anti-JAK2 and developed with anti-PTyr polyclonal antibody (not shown). GH induced a rapid tyrosine phosphorylation of JAK2, which was completely abrogated by CXCL12 pretreatment (Fig. 2B). To confirm that CXCL12 affects the entire GH-induced JAK/STAT pathway, cells as above were immunoprecipitated with anti-pTyr antibody and analyzed in Western blot with anti-STAT5 antibodies. As predicted, GH-induced STAT5 phosphorylation was abrogated in CXCL12-pretreated cells (Fig. 2C). Our data thus indicate that CXCL12 treatment blocks GH-mediated signaling events; together with previous observations (17Soriano S.F. Hernanz-Falcón P. Rodríguez-Frade J.M. Martín de Ana A. Garzón R. Carvalho-Pinto C. Vila-Coro A.J. Zaballos A. Balomenos D. Martínez A.-C. Mellado M. J. Exp. Med. 2002; 196: 311-321Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar), this suggests that chemokine-cytokine interference is a two-way phenomenon. CXCL12 treatment modifies neither GHR levels nor GH binding, as shown by flow cytometry analysis using biotin-GH followed by FITC-streptavidin (Fig. 3A). Cytokine activation of the JAK/STAT pathway leads to up-regulation of SOCS, a protein family implicated in the negative feedback of cytokine and chemokine signaling (13Naka T. Narazaki M. Hirata M.

Med. 2002; 196: 311-321Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). We thus measured SOCS up-regulation in CXCL12-treated IM9 cells. Northern blot analysis of CXCL12-stimulated IM9 cells showed SOCS1 and SOCS3 up-regulation after chemokine treatment (Fig. 3B) (maximum at 60 min); β-actin hybridization was used as a loading control. We studied the mechanism by which CXCL12-mediated SOCS up-regulation interferes in GH signaling and function. The SOCS block cytokine signaling via interactions with JAK2 (SOCS1) and/or the cytoplasmic tail of GHR (cytokine-inducible SH2 protein and SOCS3) (9Herrington J. Carter-Su C. Trends Endocrinol. Metab. 2001; 12: 252-257Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (278) Google Scholar). Untreated and CXCL12-treated (60 min, 37 °C) IM9 cells were activated with GH (10 μg/ml, 37 °C) as indicated and then lysed. Cell extracts were immunoprecipitated with anti-JAK2 and blotted with anti-SOCS1 antibodies. Results showed that CXCL12 treatment up-regulated SOCS1 expression (Fig. 3B) and promoted its association to JAK2 (Fig. 3C). Protein loading equivalence was controlled with a protein detection kit (Pierce). Notably, JAK2/SOCS1 association did not increase after GH activation, suggesting that this complex may not require further JAK2 activation (Fig. 3C). Further, untreated and CXCL12-treated (60 min, 37 °C) IM9 cells were activated with GH as above before lysis. Cell extracts were immunoprecipitated with anti-GHR and blotted with anti-SOCS3 antibody. SOCS3, which is up-regulated by CXCL12 treatment (Fig. 3B), associates with GHR (Fig. 3D). This association increases after GH binding, indicating that the hormone promotes a conformational change in the GHR that exposes or stabilizes a SOCS3 binding site. These data suggest that CXCL12 interference in GH signaling includes up-regulation of some SOCS proteins, SOCS1 and SOCS3, that associate in turn to JAK2 and GHR, blocking later signaling events. CXCL12 Treatment Modifies GH-mediated Responses in Primary Cells—We tested whether the mechanism identified in vitro is also implicated in modulation of in vivo responses. CXCL12 (50 nm) was injected intrasplenically into 4-week-old BALB/c mice. After 60 min, mice were killed, and splenocytes were used to measure SOCS1 and SOCS3 levels by Northern blot. The analysis showed that both SOCS proteins were up-regulated in vivo after CXCL12 treatment (Fig. 4A, upper); as a control, the membrane was rehybridized with the β-actin probe (Fig. 4A, lower). These splenocytes, which express CXCR4 and GHR as confirmed by flow cytometry analysis (not shown), were stimulated in vitro with GH (10 μg/ml, 37 °C) for the times indicated and then lysed. Cell extracts were immunoprecipitated with anti-pTyr and blotted using anti-JAK2 (Fig. 4B) and anti-STAT5 (Fig. 4C) antibodies. CXCL12 treatment completely abrogated GH-mediated JAK2 and STAT5 phosphorylation (Fig. 4, B and C). The potential toxic effects of intrasplenic injection were discarded by evaluating splenocyte cell cycle status after propidium iodide incorporation and flow cytometry analysis (Fig. 4D). To analyze the mechanism behind this effect, splenocytes from untreated or CXCL12-pretreated (60 min) mice were stimulated in vitro with GH (10 μg/ml, 37 °C) for the times indicated. Cells were lysed, and cell extracts were immunoprecipitated with anti-SOCS1 antibody and analyzed in Western blot using anti-JAK2 antibody. As for IM9 cells, SOCS1 associated with JAK2 in an in vivo model (Fig. 4E). GH activation did not modify JAK2/SOCS1 association, supporting the observation that association between these molecules does not require JAK2 kinase activity. In accordance, SOCS1 is described to inhibit JAK catalytic activity by an interaction between the SOCS1 kinase inhibitory region and the JAK activation loop (37Alexander W.

Interaction among different cell systems is essential for the survival of all species; coordination of various stimuli is thus a critical step in achieving optimal cell responses. Interactions between the endocrine and the immune systems have been described (38Chappel S. Murphy W. Oppenheim J. Feldman M. Durum S. Hirano T. Vilcek J. Nicola N. Cytokine Reference. First Ed. Academic Press, London2002: 251-265Google Scholar); some immune mediators have a direct effect on endocrine function (39Aller M.A. Arias J.L. Nava M.P. Arias J. Exp. Biol. Med. 2004; 229: 170-181Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar), and endocrine system proteins affect immune cell activity (40Bonizzi G. Karin M. Trends Immunol. 2004; 25: 280-288Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2080) Google Scholar, 41Akdis M. Verhagen J. Taylor A. Karamloo F. Karagiannidis C. Crameri R. Thunberg S. Deniz G.

Immune processes involve many cell types and molecules, including cytokines and chemokines, indicating the need for coordination among these molecules for an effective response. Cytokines, chemokines, and growth factors share some signaling pathways in which ligand binding stabilizes receptor oligomerization and activates JAK; several proteins including the STAT transcription factors. are then phosphorylated by this tyrosine kinase. Activated STAT proteins dimerize and translocate to the nucleus, where they mediate transcription of a broad range of genes (9Herrington J. Carter-Su C. Trends Endocrinol. Metab. 2001; 12: 252-257Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (278) Google Scholar, 30Mellado M. Rodriguez-Frade J.M. Manes S. Martínez A.-C. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 2001; 19: 397-421Crossref PubMed Scopus (299) Google Scholar), including those of the SOCS proteins. Most cytokines analyzed to date induce several SOCS in a tissue-specific manner (18Chen X.P. Losman J.A. Rothman P. Immunity. 2000; 13: 287-290Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar); SOCS could thus have a central role in coordinating individual responses from different immune system components. We recently described an active role for SOCS interfering with chemokine responses and determined that, via SOCS, stimulation of the GHR reduced the migratory capacity of different immune cell types (17Soriano S.F. Hernanz-Falcón P. Rodríguez-Frade J.M. Martín de Ana A. Garzón R. Carvalho-Pinto C. Vila-Coro A.J. Zaballos A. Balomenos D. Martínez A.-C. Mellado M. J. Exp. Med. 2002; 196: 311-321Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). Here we show a reciprocal interaction between these two families of mediators as activation of the CXCR4 chemokine receptor modulates GH cytokine responses through SOCS proteins, both in vivo and in vitro. GH exerts its effects by inducing the synthesis of its main mediator, IGF-1, which circulates in complex with high affinity IGFBP. These binding proteins act as carriers to transport IGF from the synthesis sites to target tissues; they also protect IGF from proteolytic degradation (42Martin J.L. Baxter R.C. Rosenfeld R. Roberts C. The IGF System: Molecular Biology, Physiology and Clinical Applications. Humana, Totowa, NJ1999: 227-255Crossref Google Scholar). Circulating IGF-1 is produced mainly by hepatic cells, although it presumably does not act directly on hepatocytes as they do not express detectable levels of IGF-1 receptor mRNA (43Le Roith D. Scavo L. Butler A. Trends Endocrinol. Metab. 2001; 12: 48-52Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In this model, GH triggers IGF-1 up-regulation and an increase in IGFBP3 levels, which may be an indirect effect as it is not seen in GH-stimulated, liver-specific IGF-1 gene-deleted mice (LID mice) (44Yakar S. Liu J.L. Stannard B. Butler A. Accili D. Sauer B. Le Roith D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 7324-7329Crossref PubMed Scopus (1185) Google Scholar). Our observation that CXCL12 pretreatment reduces circulating IGF-1 levels and blunts the GH-induced IGF-1 increase in serum suggests an inhibitory effect on liver IGF-1 production. The co-expression of CXCR4 (45Wald O. Pappo O. Safadi R. Dagan-Berger M. Beider K. Wald H. Franitza S. Weiss I. Avniel S. Boaz P. Hanna J. Zamir G. Eid A. Mandelboim O. Spengler U. Galun E. Peled A. Eur. J. Immunol. 2004; 34: 1164-1174Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar) and GH receptors in hepatocytes (9Herrington J. Carter-Su C. Trends Endocrinol. Metab. 2001; 12: 252-257Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (278) Google Scholar) hints at cross-talk between the signaling pathways activated through these receptors. CXCL2 could thus indirectly regulate IGF-1 expression in the liver; indeed, CXCL12 was shown to stimulate hematopoiesis in adult liver (46Kollet O. Shivtiel S. Chen Y.Q. Suriawinata J. Thung S.N. Dabeva M.D. Kahn J. Spiegel A. Dar A. Samira S. Goichberg P. Kalinkovich A. Arenzana-Seisdedos F. Nagler A. Hardan I. Revel M. Shafritz D.A. Lapidot T. J. Clin. Invest. 2003; 112: 160-169Crossref PubMed Scopus (557) Google Scholar). Our data confirm that CXCL12 pretreatment blocks GH in human IM9 lymphoblastoid cells. Chemokine treatment affected neither GH binding nor GH receptor levels, suggesting that interference is downstream of ligand/receptor interaction. As GH and CXCL12 both activate the JAK/STAT/SOCS pathway, we tested whether the effect was mediated through SOCS proteins. We found that CXCL12 treatment up-regulated SOCS1 and SOCS3 in vitro and in splenocytes from chemokine-treated mice. SOCS1 and SOCS3, by binding to JAK2 and to GHR, respectively, cooperate to abrogate GH-mediated activation. SOCS1/JAK2 association was unaffected by GH stimulation, indicating that JAK2 kinase activity is not involved in complex formation in this system. It has been established that hematopoietic cell growth, differentiation, and function are controlled by the coordinated action of the cytokine-chemokine network (47Youn B.S. Mantel C. Broxmeyer H.E. Immunol. Rev. 2000; 177: 150-174Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar). All leukocyte lineages are derived from pluripotent hematopoietic stem cells (HSC) that localize predominantly in the fetal liver and adult bone marrow. These cells can be mobilized to the periphery by cytokine treatment. Among other cytokine receptors, GHR is expressed in both hematopoietic and non-hematopoietic cells (48Kopchick J.J. Andry J.M. Mol. Genet. Metab. 2000; 71: 293-314Crossref PubMed Scopus (187) Google Scholar), and recombinant hGH significantly increases in vitro colony formation by human myeloid and erythroid progenitors (49Golde D.W. Bersch N. Li C.H. Science. 1997; 196: 1112-1113Crossref Scopus (143) Google Scholar, 50Reinerova M. Reiner P. Neoplasma (Bratisl.). 1991; 38: 175-183PubMed Google Scholar). Administration of recombinant hGH to mice after syngeneic bone marrow transplant significantly accelerates multilineage hematopoietic recovery (51Tian Z.G. Woody M.A. Sun R. Welniak L.A. Raziuddin A. Funakoshi S. Tsarfaty G. Longo D.L. Murphy W.J. Stem Cells (Mi-amisburg). 1998; 16: 193-199Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). CXCL12 and its receptor CXCR4 play a key role in HSC trafficking to bone marrow (52Wright D.E. Bowman E.P. Wagers A.J. Butcher E.C. Weissman I.L. J. Exp. Med. 2002; 195: 1145-1154Crossref PubMed Scopus (418) Google Scholar). A reduction in CXCL12 and CXCR4 activity has also been implicated in HSC mobilization by G-CSF; this treatment leads to increased granulocyte accumulation in bone marrow and subsequent release of proteases that inactivate both CXCL12 and CXCR4 (53Levesque J.P. Hendy J. Takamatsu Y. Simmons P.J. Bendall L.J. J. Clin. Invest. 2003; 111: 187-196Crossref PubMed Scopus (641) Google Scholar), triggering HSC mobilization to the periphery (54Petit I. Szyper-Kravitz M. Nagler A. Lahav M. Peled A. Habler L. Ponomaryov T. Taichman R.S. Arenzana-Seisdedos F. Fujii N. Sandbank J. Zipori D. Lapidot T. Nat. Immunol. 2002; 3: 687-694Crossref PubMed Scopus (1154) Google Scholar). The mechanism we propose could also participate in this process since, by affecting cytokine or chemokine responses, SOCS could alter the equilibrium between HSC formation and mobilization. In aged mice with impaired bone marrow hematopoietic function and reduced stem cell mobilizing capacity, hGH is reported to restore bone marrow progenitor cell growth, as well as cytokine-elicited stem cell mobilization (55Carlo-Stella C. Di Nicola M. Milani R. Longoni P. Milanesi M. Bifulco C. Stucchi C. Guidetti A. Cleris L. Formelli F. Garotta G. Gianni A.M. Exp. Hematol. 2004; 32: 171-178Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). In conclusion, the results show that individual cytokine responses are influenced by the presence of chemokines and vice versa. An overall view of these systems must thus consider the effect of cytokine/chemokine modulation of ligands and of receptors, as well as their influence on individual signaling pathways.

Biochem. J. 1982; 204: 353-356Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar, 2Paxton R. Harris R.A. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1984; 231: 48-57Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar). Whereas the BCKD complex is located in the mitochondria of all mammalian tissues, the BCKD-kinase protein content varies with tissue type. The concentration of BCKD-kinase in liver cells is low, whereas skeletal muscle has the highest level of BCKD-kinase expression. Other tissues, such as the brain and kidney, hold intermediate amounts between these two extremes (3Doering C.B. Coursey C. Spangler W. Danner D.J. Gene (Amst.). 1998; 212: 213-219Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar, 4Huang Y.S. Chuang D.T. Biochem. J. 1998; 334: 713-722Crossref PubMed Scopus (6) Google Scholar). This distribution inversely correlates with the highest BCKD activity state in the liver and the lowest BCKD activity state in skeletal muscle (5Gillim S.E. Paxton R. Cook G.A. Harris R.A. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1983; 111: 74-81Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar, 6Wagenmakers A.J. Schepens J.T. Veldhuizen J.A. Veerkamp J.H. Biochem. J. 1984; 220: 273-281Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). As a result, the general activity state of the BCKD complex varies from tissue to tissue, probable based on the ratio of phosphorylated (inactive) to dephosphorylated (active) E1α subunits within the BCKD complex. The need for regulation of BCKD activity is noted by pathological conditions that exist at the extreme activity states. Abnormally high or inappropriate BCKD complex activity has been shown to contribute to increased branched-chain amino acid catabolism and protein degradation in skeletal muscle, the hallmark of cachexia (5Gillim S.E. Paxton R. Cook G.A. Harris R.A. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1983; 111: 74-81Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar, 7Gibson R. Zhao Y. Jaskiewicz J. Fineberg S.E. Harris R.A. Arch. Biochem.

Treatment of this wasting condition, often seen in late stages of cancer and other illnesses, is of continuing concern in the care of chronically ill patients, because it often occurs even in the presence of otherwise adequate parenteral nutrient intake (8Laviano A. Meguid M.M. Nutrition. 1996; 12: 358-371Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar). In contrast, impaired BCKD complex activity results in the rare inborn error of metabolism maple syrup urine disease, a condition that can result in mental retardation, brain edema, seizures, coma, and death if not treated by life-long limitation of branched-chain amino acid intake (9Menkes J.H. Pediatrics. 1959; 23: 348-353PubMed Google Scholar, 10Dancis J. Hutzler J. Levitz M. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1960; 43: 342-343Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar, 11Chuang D.T. Niu W.L.

Numerous reports have demonstrated that insulin, glucocorticoids, and conditions such as acidosis, diabetes, hyperthyroidism, and amino acid deprivation can affect the distribution and expression of BCKD-kinase in cells and tissues with the expected change in activity state of the BCKD complex (12Popov K.M.

To date, little is known regarding the means of regulating basal BCKD-kinase expression under normal nutritional conditions including the mechanism of its tissue specificity in any organism. Similar to the subunits of the BCKD complex, the BCKD-kinase is a mitochondrial protein encoded in the nuclear genome. The gene is on human chromosome 16p11.2, mouse chromosome 7F3, and rat chromosome 1q36. The gene structure and amino acid sequence between mouse and human is highly conserved. 2NCBI Entrez Gene: www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/entrez/query.fcgi?db=gene. Gene ID numbers: 29603 (rat); 12041 (mouse); and 10295 (human). Regulation of protein expression may occur at any of several steps, including transcription, post-transcriptional mRNA stability, translational efficiency, mitochondrial membrane transport, and post-translational protein stability (16McConnell B.B. McKean M.C. Danner D.J. J. Cell. Biochem. 1996; 61: 118-126Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar, 17Sitler T.L. McKean M.C. Peinemann F. Jackson E. Danner D.J. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1998; 1404: 385-392Crossref PubMed Scopus (4) Google Scholar, 18Danner D.J. Methods Enzymol. 2000; 324: 336-342Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Previously, the binding of the transcription factor Sp1 at a weak non-canonical site was shown to be both necessary and sufficient for minimal BCKD-kinase transcription in cultured rat hepatoma and kidney cells (4Huang Y.S. Chuang D.T. Biochem. J. 1998; 334: 713-722Crossref PubMed Scopus (6) Google Scholar, 19Huang Y. Chuang D.T. Biochem. J. 1996; 313: 603-609Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar). Whereas this site is conserved in both sequence and location among the rat, mouse, and human, the BCKD-kinase nucleic acid sequence upstream of this site shows little similarity in these species. Because the liver has the lowest levels of BCKD-kinase protein among all of the tissues studied and the skeletal muscle has the highest, a comparison of regulatory effectors in these two tissues will provide the necessary information to begin to understand how the expression of this gene is controlled. In this study, we use cultured BNL Cl.2 normal mouse liver cells and differentiated C2C12 mouse myotubes to explore the means used to control expression of BCKD-kinase. The results demonstrate that transcription of this gene and stability of the murine BCKD-kinase mRNA do not differ substantially between these two cell types. Further, unlike in the rat cells, basal transcription is not dependent upon Sp1 binding at the previously described site. Finally, we show that translation of the BCKD-kinase transcript does differ between the cell lines and involves an upstream open reading frame in the 5′-UTR that encodes a putative peptide conserved in mouse, rat, chimpanzee, and human. Cell Culture—BNL Cl.2 mouse liver cells and C2C12 mouse myoblasts were obtained from American Type Culture Collection (ATCC, Manasass, VA). NIH-3T3 mouse fibroblasts and previously described Sp1–/– mouse fibroblast-like cells (20Ping D. Boekhoudt G. Zhang F. Morris A. Philipsen S. Warren S.T. Boss J.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 1708-1714Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar) were a gift from Dr. Stephen Warren (Emory University, Department of Human Genetics). BNL Cl.2 and C2C12 cells were propagated in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 4.5 g/liter d-glucose, 2 mm l-glutamine, and 1 mm sodium pyruvate (MediaTech, Herndon, VA) and supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum. To trigger fusion into contractile myotubes, confluent C2C12 myoblasts were grown for 3 days in differentiation medium made up of Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% horse serum (HyClone, Logan, UT). NIH-3T3 cells were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% newborn calf serum (HyClone). Sp1–/– cells were grown in Invitrogen α-minimum essential medium containing 2 mm l-glutamine and 1 mm sodium pyruvate and supplemented with 5% fetal bovine serum, 1 ng/ml basic fibroblast growth factor (Roche Diagnostics), and 4 μg/ml crystalline bovine zinc insulin (Invitrogen). All of the cell culture media contained 1% penicillin/streptomycin (MediaTech). Cells lines were maintained in a humidified atmosphere of 5% CO2 at 37 °C. RNA Isolation, Northern Blot, and RT-PCR Analyses—Total cellular RNA was prepared with TRI reagent (Sigma) from one 75-cm2 flask of confluent BNL Cl2. cells, a 3-day culture of differentiated C2C12 cells, or from adult male C57BL/6 mouse tissues stabilized in RNAlater (Ambion Inc., Austin, TX) according to the manufacturers' instructions. For RNA stability experiments, cells were incubated in growth or differentiation medium containing 10 μg/ml actinomycin D (Sigma) for 3, 6, 12, and 24 h. Untreated cells were used as the control 0-h time point. For Northern blot analysis, 10 μg of total RNA was electrophoresed on a 1% agarose, 2.2 m formaldehyde gel in 1× MOPS and transferred to a MagnaGraph neutral nylon membrane (Micron Separations, West-boro, MA) by capillary transfer in 20× SSC overnight at room temperature. Radiolabeled murine BCKD-kinase, 18 S, and rat GAPDH cDNA probes were made with [α-32P]dCTP using the RediPrime kit (Amersham Biosciences). Hybridization was performed overnight in ULTRA-hyb (Ambion) at 42 °C. This membrane was then washed twice in 2× SSC, 0.1% SDS for 10 min each and twice in 0.1× SSC, 0.1% SDS for 15 min each. All of the washes were performed at 42 °C. All of the solutions were treated with diethyl pyrocarbonate to inactivate RNases. Hybridization signals were detected by scanning on a Molecular Dynamics Typhoon 9200 PhosphorImager and quantified using ImageQuant densitometry software (Amersham Biosciences). For RT-PCR analysis, random hexanucleotide primers were used to generate first-strand cDNA from either 2.5 μg of total RNA isolated as described above or yeast tRNA (Sigma) using the SuperScript first-strand synthesis system for RT-PCR (Invitrogen). For gene-specific PCR, 2 μl of first-strand cDNA product was amplified with platinum Taq polymerase (Invitrogen) according to manufacturer's instructions. Specific gene amplification products were as follows: for BCKD-kinase, either a 428-bp product from primers mkexon1–2for (5′-GTCTGGCCTCGCGATGGAAGC-3′) and mkexon3rev (5′-CCTGTGAGCGACCGGAATAGAGCA-3′) at 60 °C anneal or a 321-bp product from primers mB-CKDK9for (5′-GCCCCTCGAGTCCGCATCAAC-3′) and mBCKDK-11rev (5′-GTGCATATCCAGGTGGCCGAAGAG-3′) at 60 °C anneal; a 255-bp BCKD-E1α product from primers mE1A-8for (5′-AGGCAGTACCTGCTGAACCAG-3′) and mE1A-9rev (5′-GCTAGGGCCTCACTTGTCAAAGT-3′) at 58 °C anneal; a 627-bp GAPDH product from primers mGAPDH1for (5′-TGAAGGTCGGTGTGAACGGATTTG-3′) and mGA-PDH1rev (5′-CACCAGTGGATGCAGGGATGATGT-3′) at 60 °C anneal; a 561-bp firefly luciferase product from primers lucif-for 1 (5′-TGCGCCCGCGAACGACATTTA-3′) and lucif-rev1 (5′-GGCACCAGCAGCGCACTTTGAA-3′) at 57 °C anneal; and a 325-bp 18 S ribosomal subunit product from primers m18SFOR-2 (5′-TGGATACCGCAGCTAGGAATAATG 3′) and m18SREV-2 (5′-CCCCCGGAACCCAAAGACT-3′) at 57 °C anneal. All of the PCR products were resolved by electrophoresis on 1.5% agarose gels and assessed by ethidium bromide staining. Mitochondria Isolation and Western Blot—For mitochondria isolation, ∼5 × 107 BNL Cl.2 cells or differentiated C2C12 myotubes were harvested with trypsin/EDTA, centrifuged at 300 × g, washed in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS), and resuspended in 1 ml of mitochondrial isolation buffer (220 mm mannitol, 70 mm sucrose, 2 mm HEPES, pH to 7.4 with KOH). Cells were then homogenized by douncing 25 times in a Wheaton Potter-Elvehjem tissue grinder, and nuclei were pelleted by centrifugation at 2000 × g for 10 min at 4 °C. The mitochondria were isolated from the cytoplasmic supernatant by centrifugation for 10 min at 15,000 × g at 4 °C. For tissues, the procedure was similar with the exception that finely diced pieces of adult male C57BL/6 mouse liver, whole brain, kidney, heart, and skeletal muscle were homogenized in the following buffers (all pH 7.4): liver in mitochondrial isolation buffer; brain in 10 mm Tris-Cl, 250 mm sucrose, 0.5 mm EDTA; kidney in 300 mm sucrose; and heart and skeletal muscle in 70 mm mannitol, 220 mm sucrose, 5 mm Tris-Cl. The protein concentration in each sample was determined using the BCA protein assay (Pierce). For Western blot experiments, mitochondrial protein was resolved through 10% SDS-PAGE and then transferred to a nitrocellulose membrane by electroblotting in transfer buffer (24.7 mm Tris, 192 mm glycine, 20% methanol) at room temperature over 2 h. Equality of protein loading and transfer was determined by Ponceau S staining of the membrane. Development of the immunoblot with BCKD-kinase antibody was as previously described (21Danner D.J. Elsas L.J. Litwer S. Methods Enzymol. 1988; 166: 108-114Crossref PubMed Scopus (2) Google Scholar). Visualization of the antibody binding was with West Pico chemiluminescent substrate detection protocol (Pierce). The chemiluminescent signal was exposed to Blue BioFilm (Denville Scientific Inc., Metuchen, NJ) for 2–5 min. In some experiments, the blot was stripped of all of the antibodies and then re-probed with a 1: 3,000 dilution of primary polyclonal rabbit anti-BCKD sera and a 1: 25,000 dilution of goat anti-rabbit-horseradish peroxidase-conjugated antibody (Bio-Rad). All of the incubations, antibody dilutions, and washes were performed at room temperature in IM2 (50 mm Tris-Cl, 150 mm NaCl, 5 mm EDTA, 0.25% gelatin, 1% Tween 20). Whole Cell BCKD Assay—Whole cell BCKD activity state, expressed as percent activity, was determined by measuring the pmol 14CO2 released from [1-14C]leucine per milligram of total cellular protein under basal conditions relative to that produced after a 10-min preincubation with 1 mm α-chloroisocaproate, an inhibitor of BCKD-kinase, as previously described (17Sitler T.L. McKean M.C. Peinemann F. Jackson E. Danner D.J. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1998; 1404: 385-392Crossref PubMed Scopus (4) Google Scholar, 22Harris R.A. Kuntz M.J. Simpson R.

Luciferase Reporter Vector Construction—A 930-bp PCR product was amplified from mouse genomic DNA using the Expand Long Template PCR system (Roche Applied Science) with the PAGE-purified 5′-phosphorylated primers mkpro5for (5′-GGAGCCCTCATAAATTCTTGTGGT-3′) and mkex2rev3 (5′-CATTGTCCTGCTACTTTGTTGAA-3′). The PCR reactions were cleaned with QIAquick PCR purification kit (Qiagen Inc., Valencia, CA) according to the manufacturer's instructions. The purified PCR product was then cloned into the Klenow-treated NcoI site of pGL3Basic vector (Promega, Madison, WI). The inserted PCR fragment spanned from 79 bp 5′ of the mouse BCKD-kinase transcriptional start site up to, but not including, the ATG translational start site in exon 2. Plasmid ligation fused the entire 5′-UTR of mouse BCKD-kinase to the translational start ATG of the luciferase reporter gene in this vector, creating the luciferase construct pEMluc3mk[–79]. A Lambda FIX II phage mouse genomic library (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA) was screened with various rat and mouse BCKD-kinase exon DNA sequence probes. Of the two positive clones found, clone 4 hybridized with a probe-bearing sequence from BCKD-kinase exons 1–4. The insert was cloned into pBluescript II KS–vector (Stratagene) via the flanking NotI restriction sites. The resulting 16.2-kb plasmid, designated pmkin4, contained several kilobases of genomic DNA 5′ to the mouse BCKD-kinase gene through the first 234 bp of intron 4. A 945-bp BglII/BamHI fragment of the mouse BCKD-kinase gene was cut from pmkin4 and subcloned into the BglII site of pGL3Promoter (Promega). This fragment contained a sequence from ∼298 bp 5′ to the start of transcription through most of intron 1. Vector pEMluc3mk[–298] then was constructed by ligating the BglII/NdeI restriction fragment from this subclone into BglII/NdeI-cut pEMluc3mk[–79]. Plasmid pEMluc3mk[–4174] was created by subcloning a 4.2-kb fragment from pmkin4 into pEMluc3mk[–79] using KpnI and NdeI restriction enzymes. Vector pEMluc3mk[–1107] resulted from digesting pEMluc3mk[–4174] with KpnI and EcoRI and blunting the ends with T4 DNA polymerase followed by ligation. Internal deletion of this vector with NheI and XhoI followed by blunting of the ends and re-ligation yielded pEMluc3mk[–1107/ΔuORF]. Restriction endonuclease digestions and DNA sequencing (Emory Core Sequencing Facility) were used to verify all of the plasmid constructs. Restriction enzymes, Klenow fragment, T4 DNA polymerase, and T4 DNA ligase were obtained from New England Biolabs (Beverly, MA). Transient Transfection and Luciferase Reporter Analysis—An overnight culture of 7.5 × 104 NIH-3T3, 7.5 × 104 Sp1–/–, 1.5 × 105 BNL Cl.2, or 1.5 × 105 C2C12 cells, plated in 6-well tissue culture plates was transfected with a mixture containing a 3:1 volume-to-mass ratio of FuGENE 6 transfection reagent (Roche Applied Science) to total plasmid DNA in supplement-free growth medium, 3 μg of firefly luciferase reporter construct, and 120 ng of pRL-null Renilla plasmid (Promega). 24 h post-transfection, the growth medium was replaced with fresh medium (or switched to differentiation medium for the C2C12 cells) and replaced again every 24 h thereafter. Cells were harvested 72 h post-transfection according to the passive lysis conditions in the Dual luciferase reporter system protocol (Promega). The ratio of firefly luciferase to Renilla luciferase luminescence was manually measured on a Turner Systems 20/20–1E luminometer, setting the luminescence from untransfected control cell lysates of the appropriate cell type as background for each measurement. The figures represent the mean luminescence ratio ± S.E. of three independent experiments, each performed in triplicate, for each reporter construct. Average values for different vectors were compared using a one-tailed Student's t test (Microsoft Excel, version X) (p values <0.05 were considered significant). Nuclear Extract Preparation—This procedure was performed essentially as described (23Tarumi T. Kravtsov D.V. Zhao M. Williams S.M. Gailani D. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 18510-18516Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar) with modifications. Just prior to use, a 25× protease inhibitor solution was made by dissolving Complete protease inhibitor mixture tablet (Roche Applied Science) in 2 ml of RNase-free ultrapure dH2O and then it was added fresh to each buffer at a 1× concentration. All of the glass tubes and pestles used for nuclear extract preparation were pre-chilled on ice. Cells were grown to confluence and fully differentiated where appropriate in 75-cm2 flasks. Cells were harvested with trypsin/EDTA, washed with PBS, and resuspended in 1 ml of hypotonic buffer (20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 10 mm KCl, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm DTT, 1× protease inhibitors) per flask. Cells were incubated on ice for 15 min and then dounced 30 times in a glass using Pestle B. Nuclei were pelleted by centrifugation at 2,000 × g for 10 min at 4 °C and washed in hypotonic buffer. The nuclear pellets were resuspended in 125 μl of high salt extraction buffer (20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 420 mm KCl, 25% glycerol, 0.2 mm EDTA, 0.5 mm MgCl2, 1 mm DTT, 1× protease inhibitors) per flask, mixed by vortexing, and incubated on ice for 30 min. The suspension was then centrifuged at 15,000 × g for 15 min at 4 °C. The supernatant (nuclear extract) was assessed for protein concentration by BCA protein assay (Pierce), aliquotted, flash-frozen in liquid nitrogen, and stored at –80 °C. For mouse tissues, the protocol was modified from that described for cells (23Tarumi T. Kravtsov D.V. Zhao M. Williams S.M. Gailani D. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 18510-18516Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar, 24Borchert A. Savaskan N.E. Kuhn H. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 2571-2580Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar) and partially based on the instructions from the nuclear extract kit available from Active Motif (Carlsbad, CA). Freshly isolated adult male C57BL/6 mouse liver or thigh muscle was minced, weighed, and homogenized at low speed on a Polytron homogenizer in 3 ml of hypotonic buffer per gram of tissue. The homogenates were incubated on ice for 15 min, and any undisrupted tissue was removed by centrifugation at 850 × g for 10 min at 4 °C. The supernatants (cytoplasmic fraction) were removed, and the cell pellets were resuspended in 1 ml of hypotonic buffer. After a 15-min incubation on ice, the cells were dounced in glass using Pestle B. Nuclei were pelleted by centrifugation at 2,000 × g for 10 min at 4 °C. The supernatants were removed and pooled with the earlier cytoplasmic fractions. The nuclear pellets were resuspended in 1 ml of high salt extraction buffer, vortexed, and incubated on ice for 30 min. The nuclear extract was clarified and aliquotted as in the procedure for cells. Rat liver nuclear extract was supplied by Active Motif. DNase I Protection—This procedure was performed as described previously (25Kelly S.E. Bachurski C.J. Burhans M.S. Glasser S.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 6881-6888Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (218) Google Scholar) with some modifications. A 442-bp substrate for DNase I digestion was produced from PCR amplification of plasmid pEMluc3mk[–1107] with primer mkpro4for (5′-GAGGAGTCAGATCTTGTTACG-3′) and mkpro5rev (5′-CGCCGGAGGGGGTCTGTG-3′) using an anneal temperature of 57 °C. For each amplification, one of the primers in each pair was end-labeled with 32P prior to PCR for visualization of a single DNA strand. Each radiolabeled PCR product was cleaned with the QIAquick PCR purification kit (Qiagen), and aliquots of the resulting purified product were assessed by electrophoresis on 1.5% agarose and by scintillation counting. For DNase I protection experiments, 50-μl reactions containing 10 mm Tris-Cl, pH 7.5, 5 mm MgCl2, 50 μm EDTA, 75 mm KCl, 12% glycerol, 0.4 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1 mm DTT, 50 ng/μl poly(dI·dC), and ∼20,000 cpm of purified radiolabeled PCR product were incubated at room temperature for 30 min in the presence of 30 μg of crude nuclear extract or bovine serum albumin. Subsequently, 50 μl of RQ1 RNase-free DNase I (Promega), freshly diluted in digestion buffer (10 mm MgCl2, 5 mm CaCl2), was added. DNase I was used at 0.13, 0.4, or 1.2 units per reaction. Incubations proceeded for 1.5 min at room temperature. All of the reactions were stopped by adding 100 μlof a buffer containing 200 mm NaCl, 20 mm EDTA, 1% SDS, and 60 μg/ml yeast tRNA (Sigma). DNA was phenol:chloroform-extracted, ethanol-precipitated, and dried under vacuum. The DNA pellet was resuspended in sequencing stop buffer (10 mm NaOH, 95% deionized formamide, 0.05% bromphenol blue, 0.05% xylene cyanol) and heated at 95 °C for 3 min. Sample aliquots were resolved on a 6% acrylamide/8 m Urea gel in 1× TBE. The fmol DNA cycle sequencing system (Promega) was used to generate dideoxyribonucleotide-terminated ladders for sequence comparison using the same primers and template as was used to generate the DNase I substrate. Size comparison was also made with a 25-bp DNA ladder (Invitrogen) that was 32P end-labeled with T4 polynucleotide kinase. Sequencing gels were dried under vacuum at 80 °C for 2 h, and autoradiography was performed on Kodak Biomax MS film at –80 °C with intensifying screens. Electrophoretic Mobility Shift Assay (EMSA)—To make radiolabeled double-stranded DNA oligomers for EMSA, equimolar amounts of complementary single-stranded DNA oligomers were mixed in annealing buffer (10 mm Tris-Cl, 1 mm EDTA, pH 8.0, 50 mm NaCl) and slowly cooled from 95 to 15 °C over the course of 1.5 h in a PerkinElmer Gene-Amp 9600 PCR machine. Of the resulting double-stranded products, 20 pmol were 32P end-labeled with T4 polynucleotide kinase and the column was purified in G25 Sephadex spin columns (Roche Applied Science). In some experiments, 3′-biotinylated double-stranded DNA oligomers were used. To make these detection probes, single-stranded DNA oligomers were first labeled with the Biotin 3′-End DNA-labeling kit (Pierce) and then annealed at room temperature for 1.5 h. EMSA binding reactions containing 10 mm Tris-Cl, pH 7.5, 5 mm MgCl2, 50 μm EDTA, 75 mm KCl, 12% glycerol, 0.4 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1mm DTT, 50 ng/μl poly dI·dC, and 10 μg of crude nuclear extract were incubated with unlabeled double-stranded oligomer for 10 min at room temperature. Subsequently, 20 fmol of 3′-biotinylated probe or 10 fmol (20,000–30,000 cpm) of 5′-32P-labeled probe was added and incubation continued at room temperature for an additional 10 min. In antibody supershift experiments, 2 μg of Sp1, Sp3, or TFIID antibodies (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Santa Cruz, CA) were added to the reactions, and incubation continued for an additional 10 min. In some reactions, oligomers bearing a consensus sequence for either Sp1 (Promega) or EBNA-1 (Pierce) transcription factor binding were used as competitors. All of the unlabeled competitor oligomers were used at 200× the molar amount of labeled probe. Resolution of free probe from protein-bound probe was performed by non-denaturing electrophoresis through 4% acrylamide/bisacrylamide (29: 1) in 0.5× TBE at room temperature. For the biotinylated probes, gels were semi-dry-electroblotted onto Hybond N+ nylon membrane (Amersham Biosciences) in 0.5× TBE for 1 h at room temperature. Band detection was performed with the LightShift chemiluminescent EMSA kit (Pierce) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Gels using radiolabeled probes were dried and autoradiographed as described under “Experimental Procedures.” Cytoplasmic Fractionation and Polyribosome Analysis—This procedure was performed as described previously (26Feng Y.

BNL Cl.2 cells were plated, transfected, and maintained as described under “Experimental Procedures.” After 72 h, the medium in each well was replaced with fresh medium containing 100 μg/ml cycloheximide and the cells w"

We demonstrated previously that angiotensin II stimulates hypertrophy in C2C12 myoblasts by transient activation of the cyclin-dependent kinase 4 complex, subsequent phosphorylation of retinoblastoma protein, release of histone deacetylase 1 from the retinoblastoma protein inhibitory complex, and partial activation of the transcription factor E2F-1. These observations led us to propose a model in which partial inactivation of the retinoblastoma protein complex leads to the derepression of a subset of E2F-1 targets necessary for cell growth without division during hypertrophy. We now present data that support this model and suggest the mechanism by which E2F-1 regulates hypertrophy. We examined expression profiles of angiotensin II-stimulated myoblasts and identified a subset of E2F-1 target genes that are specifically regulated during the hypertrophic response. We showed that the expression of E2F-1 targets involved in G1/S transit, DNA replication, and mitosis is not altered during the hypertrophic response, while the expression of E2F-1-regulated genes controlling early G1 progression, cytoskeletal organization, protein synthesis, mitochondrial function, and programmed cell death is up-regulated. Furthermore, we demonstrated that activation of cytochrome c oxidase genes occurs during the development of hypertrophy and that cytochrome c oxidase IV is a direct transcriptional target of E2F-1. These studies demonstrated that E2F-1 activity at specific promoters is dependent on physiological circumstances and that E2F-1 should be considered a potential target in the treatment of pathologic hypertrophy. Cellular hypertrophy, or growth without division, is an adaptive response to various physiological and pathological stimuli in postmitotic muscle. We demonstrated previously that angiotensin II stimulates hypertrophy in C2C12 myoblasts by transient activation of the cyclin-dependent kinase 4 complex, subsequent phosphorylation of retinoblastoma protein, release of histone deacetylase 1 from the retinoblastoma protein inhibitory complex, and partial activation of the transcription factor E2F-1.

Cellular hypertrophy, or growth without division, is an adaptive response to various physiological and pathological stresses in postmitotic muscle. The decision to undergo DNA synthesis and proliferation or to cease proliferation is determined in late G1 of the cell cycle (1Pardee A.B. Science. 1989; 246: 603-608Crossref PubMed Scopus (1854) Google Scholar). G1 progression and G1/S transit are governed by G1 cyclins and cyclin-dependent kinase (Cdk) 1The abbreviations used are: Cdk, cyclin-dependent kinase; Rb, retinoblastoma protein; AngII, angiotensin II; Cox, cytochrome c oxidase; RT, reverse transcription; Ad, adenovirus; EMSA, electrophoretic mobility shift assay; ChIP, chromatin immunoprecipitation. complexes through their actions on the E2F-1·retinoblastoma protein (Rb) complex (2Sherr C.J. Science. 1996; 274: 1672-1677Crossref PubMed Scopus (4977) Google Scholar,3Harbour J.W. Dean D.C. Genes Dev. 2000; 14: 2393-2409Crossref PubMed Scopus (959) Google Scholar). Cdks 4 and 6, assembled with their regulatory subunits, the D-type cyclins, are activated in response to mitogenic stimuli, heralding cell cycle entry and G1 progression (4Morgan D.O. Annu. Rev. Cell Dev. Biol. 1997; 13: 261-291Crossref PubMed Scopus (1804) Google Scholar). Active Cdk4/6·cyclin D1 phosphorylates Rb during early G1; this leads to the up-regulation of cyclin E, its assembly with Cdk2, and activation of the Cdk2·cyclin E complex, which in turn hyperphosphorylates Rb (5Lundberg A.S. Weinberg R.A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 753-761Crossref PubMed Scopus (856) Google Scholar). Hyperphosphorylated Rb releases and thereby activates the transcription factor E2F-1, allowing the expression of genes necessary for G1/S transit, DNA replication, and mitosis (6Ishida S. Huang E. Zuzan H. Spang R. Leone G. West M. Nevins J.R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 21: 4684-4699Crossref PubMed Scopus (498) Google Scholar). The E2F family of transcription factors plays an important role in regulating the expression of genes required for G1/S transit, DNA replication, and mitosis. The E2F family can be divided into distinct subgroups on the basis of their structural and functional similarities. E2F-1, E2F-2, and E2F-3 are primarily transcriptional activators; their expression peaks in late G1 and coincides with activation of G1/S-specific genes (7Leone G. DeGregori J. Yan Z. Jakoi L. Ishida S. Williams R.S. Nevins J.R. Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 2120-2130Crossref PubMed Scopus (310) Google Scholar). In contrast, E2F-4 and E2F-5 act mainly as transcriptional repressors by primarily complexing with the Rb-related proteins p107 and p130 (8Smith E.J. Leone G. DeGregori J. Jakoi L. Nevins J.R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 6965-6976Crossref PubMed Scopus (207) Google Scholar). E2F-6 is a transcriptional repressor that lacks domains for Rb binding and for transactivation (9Cartwright P. Muller H. Wagener C. Holm K. Helin K. Oncogene. 1998; 17: 611-623Crossref PubMed Scopus (163) Google Scholar, 10Gaubatz S. Wood J.G. Livingston D.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 9190-9195Crossref PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar) and is thought to exert its transcriptional repression through the recruitment of polycomb group proteins, histone methyltransferase, and Mga and Max proteins (11Ogawa H. Ishiguro K. Gaubatz S. Livingston D.M. Nakatani Y. Science. 2002; 296: 1132-1136Crossref PubMed Scopus (629) Google Scholar). E2F-7 recently was identified and is thought to be a transcriptional repressor of cell cycle progression (12Di Stefano L. Jensen M.R. Helin K. EMBO J. 2003; 22: 6289-6298Crossref PubMed Scopus (211) Google Scholar, 13de Bruin A. Maiti B. Jakoi L. Timmers C. Buerki R. Leone G. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 42041-42049Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (165) Google Scholar). While details about the E2F family are being elucidated, precise functional divisions among individual members and the level of redundancy among them are only starting to be made clear. Recent knock-out experiments have provided some insight. Studies in E2F-1-deficient mouse embryonic fibroblasts have demonstrated that E2F-1 is required for timely cell cycle reentry in G0-arrested cells but not for G1/S transit in cycling cells (14Wang Z.M. Yang H. Livingston D.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 15583-15586Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). In contrast, E2F-4/E2F-5 single or double nullizygous mouse embryonic fibroblasts show no defect in cell cycle reentry from G0 and proliferate normally (15Gaubatz S. Lindeman G.J. Ishida S. Jakoi L. Nevins J.R. Livingston D.M. Rempel R.E. Mol. Cell. 2000; 6: 729-735Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (222) Google Scholar). Studies with E2F-6-deficient mouse embryonic fibroblasts have demonstrated that E2F-6 is not required either for growth arrest following serum withdrawal or for timely reentry into the cell cycle from G0 (16Storre J. Elsasser H.P. Fuchs M. Ullmann D. Livingston D.M. Gaubatz S. EMBO Rep. 2002; 3: 695-700Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). In whole animals, E2F-1-null mice have a higher incidence of tumor development but exhibit testicular atrophy, suggesting tissue-specific functions for E2F-1 in both suppressing and stimulating cell proliferation (17Field S.J. Tsai F.Y. Kuo F. Zubiaga A.M. Kaelin Jr., W.G. Livingston D.M. Orkin S.H. Greenberg M.E. Cell. 1996; 85: 549-561Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (691) Google Scholar). In muscle, E2F-1 overexpression has been shown to drive postmitotic rat ventricular myocytes into G1 both in vitro and in vivo (18Kirshenbaum L.A. Abdellatif M. Chakraborty S. Schneider M.D. Dev. Biol. 1996; 179: 402-411Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar, 19Agah R. Kirshenbaum L.A. Abdellatif M. Truong L.D. Chakraborty S. Michael L.H. Schneider M.D. J. Clin. Investig. 1997; 100: 2722-2728Crossref PubMed Scopus (181) Google Scholar, 20Akli S. Zhan S. Abdellatif M. Schneider M.D. Circ. Res. 1999; 85: 319-328Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). Taken together, these observations suggest that E2F-1, as distinct from other E2F family members, promotes cell cycle reentry in G0-arrested cells. Previous experiments have suggested that differentiating, cell cycle-arrested myoblasts treated with hypertrophic stimuli, such as angiotensin II (AngII), undergo a process with biochemical features similar to cell cycle reentry (21Hlaing M. Shen X. Dazin P. Bernstein H.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 23794-23799Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). E2F-1, therefore, would appear to be the most likely among E2F family members to be involved. Over the past several years, the role of E2F-1 in the transcriptional regulation of other cellular functions, such as apoptosis, has been revealed (22Helin K. Curr. Opin. Genet. Dev. 1998; 8: 28-35Crossref PubMed Scopus (428) Google Scholar, 23Dick F.A. Dyson N. Mol. Cell. 2003; 12: 639-649Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar). However, little is known about the role of E2F-1 during muscle development or in response to pathophysiological conditions. Recently others have reported a role for E2F-1 during skeletal muscle regeneration (24Yan Z. Choi S. Liu X. Zhang M. Schageman J.J. Lee S.Y. Hart R. Lin L. Thurmond F.A. Williams R.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 8826-8836Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (207) Google Scholar). Although both E2F-1 and E2F-2 expression were induced in response to skeletal muscle injury, regeneration was severely compromised in E2F-1-null mice but not in E2F-2-null mice. In addition, others have demonstrated that inhibition of E2F-1 prevents the development of myocyte hypertrophy in vitro, suggesting that E2F-1 is necessary for hypertrophy (25Vara D. Bicknell K.A. Coxon C.H. Brooks G. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 21388-21394Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). The mechanism by which E2F-1 controls the hypertrophic response, however, has not been described. We demonstrated previously that AngII stimulates hypertrophy in C2C12 myoblasts by transient activation of Cdk4, subsequent phosphorylation of Rb, release of histone deacetylase 1 from the Rb inhibitory complex, and partial activation of E2F-1 (21Hlaing M. Shen X. Dazin P. Bernstein H.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 23794-23799Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). We hypothesized that partial inactivation of the Rb complex leads to the derepression of a subset of E2F-1-responsive genes necessary for cell growth without division during hypertrophy (21Hlaing M. Shen X. Dazin P. Bernstein H.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 23794-23799Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). We now present data that support this model and suggest the mechanism by which E2F-1 regulates hypertrophy. We examined expression profiles of AngII-stimulated myoblasts and identified subsets of E2F-1 target genes that are specifically regulated during the hypertrophic response. These data revealed that E2F-1-responsive genes involved in protein synthesis, cytoskeletal organization, and mitochondrial function were up-regulated during the hypertrophic response. However, the expression patterns of E2F-1 targets that regulate G1/S transit, DNA replication, and mitosis were not altered. To determine whether our data would identify novel E2F-1 targets involved in the hypertrophy response, we examined the transcriptional regulation of members of the cytochrome c oxidase (Cox) gene family. We demonstrated that Cox IV is a direct transcriptional target of E2F-1 and mapped the E2F-1-regulatory element within the Cox IV promoter. Cell Culture—C2C12 skeletal myoblasts (ATCC) were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (Invitrogen) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum and 100 IU of penicillin/streptomycin. Cells were synchronized in the quiescent state by starvation for 36–48 h with serum-free Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium and stimulated with 100 nm AngII (Sigma) to render hypertrophy for the indicated times at 37 °C. Microarray Analysis—The Qiagen/Operon version 2.0 mouse oligonucleotide library, comprised of oligonucleotides (70-mers) representing 16,443 unique mouse genes, was printed on poly-l-lysine-coated glass slides. The library also included sets of positive and negative controls that were used for quality control purposes. Oligonucleotides were prepared in sets of 384-well plates at a concentration of 40 μm. Arrays were prepared using a custom-built array printer equipped with Majer MicroQuill-2000 split tip pins with a capacity of 255 slides per print run. The printed arrays were numbered sequentially during each run and tracked by a unique identification number. After completion of printing and air drying of the arrays, all slides were washed in 0.2% SDS to remove excess oligonucleotide followed by a brief rinse in 70% ethanol. Slides selected from throughout the run were tested for correct printing by nonspecific hybridization of Cy3-labeled, random 9-mers. An additional test to confirm DNA attachment and availability of the oligonucleotides was performed by hybridization of Cy3- and Cy5-labeled cDNAs prepared from total RNA isolated from previously characterized tissues or cell lines. For microarray analysis, total RNA was purified from quiescent C2C12 myoblasts and myoblasts that were stimulated with AngII for 12 or 24 h using the RNeasy minikit (Qiagen). The quality of RNA was analyzed using the RNA 6000 nanokit on an Agilent BioAnalyzer 2100 system (Agilent Technologies); as expected, discreet 28 S rRNA and 18 S rRNA peaks were observed. RNA samples with an A260/A280 ratio of 1.8–2.1 were used. Targets to be hybridized to the arrays were prepared by synthesis of single-stranded cDNA from total RNA using an oligo(dT) primer in the presence of aminoallyl-modified dUTP. After synthesis, RNA was removed by hydrolysis in alkali followed by neutralization and ethanol precipitation. Either monofunctional N-hydroxysuccinimide ester Cy3 or Cy5 fluors were chemically coupled to the free amine groups incorporated into the cDNA. After coupling, the uncoupled fluors were quenched by the addition of hydroxylamine and then removed by purification using a Qiagen QIAquick cleanup kit. Efficiency of cDNA synthesis and Cy3 and Cy5 labeling was monitored by measurement of the absorbance at 260, 550, and 649 nm, respectively. Arrays were hybridized using a Genomic Solutions GeneTAC Hybridization Station according to the manufacturer's instructions. Slides were scanned for the presence of Cy3 and Cy5 signal using an Axon GenePix4000 scanner, and the images were quantified using GenePix Pro 3.0 software. Normalization of arrays was performed using the Locally Weighted Scatter plot Smooth (LOWESS) normalization algorithm in the Bioconductor package (www.bioconductor.org). Expression ratios were calculated using the SCANALYZE software package (26Eisen M.B. Brown P.O. Methods Enzymol. 1999; 303: 179-205Crossref PubMed Scopus (900) Google Scholar). Ratios had a mean close to 1 and a S.D. of 0.4 for each array, which is comparable to the variation seen in other array studies (27Shen X. Collier J.M. Hlaing M. Zhang L. Delshad E.H. Bristow J. Bernstein H.S. Dev. Dyn. 2003; 226: 128-138Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar, 28Friddle C.J. Koga T. Rubin E.M. Bristow J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Shalon D. Botstein D. Brown P.O. Science. 1999; 283: 83-87Crossref PubMed Scopus (1730) Google Scholar). Each array experiment was performed at least four times with independently isolated RNA target pools and arrays. To correct for any gene-, sequence-, or intensity-specific artifacts, a set of three arrays comparing quiescent, serum-deprived cells was used to determine normal variation in expression level for each gene as described previously (29Iyer V.R. Eisen M.B. Ross D.T. Schuler G. Moore T. Lee J.C. Trent J.M. Staudt L.M. Hudson Jr., J. Boguski M.S. Lashkari D. Shalon D. Botstein D. Brown P.O. Science. 1999; 283: 83-87Crossref PubMed Scopus (1730) Google Scholar). The median expression ratio for each gene over the three control arrays was compared with each subsequent experimental array. Statistical significance for multiple comparisons of changes in expression was determined using two-sided, unpaired t tests (30Callow M.J. Dudoit S. Gong E.L. Speed T.P. Rubin E.M. Genome Res. 2000; 10: 2022-2029Crossref PubMed Scopus (184) Google Scholar). Absolute -fold change in expression greater than 1.5 with p < 0.05 was considered significant. GenMAPP and MAPPFinder (www.GenMAPP.org) were used to cluster microarray data into functional groups and biological pathways, respectively (31Dahlquist K.D. Salomonis N. Vranizan K. Lawlor S.C. Conklin B.R. Nat. Genet. 2002; 31: 19-20Crossref PubMed Scopus (807) Google Scholar, 32Doniger S.W. Salomonis N. Dahlquist K.D. Vranizan K. Lawlor S.C. Conklin B.R. Genome Biol. 2003; (http://genomebiology.com/2003/4/1/R7 [GRAPHIC])PubMed Google Scholar). The array data were deposited in Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) and can be viewed or downloaded under accession number GSE1592. Semiquantitative RT-PCR—Total RNA was extracted using the RNeasy minikit (Qiagen). RT-PCR was performed, following DNase I treatment, using the Titanium one-step RT-PCR kit (BD Biosciences) as described by the manufacturer. A minimum amount of cycles was carried out to ensure linear amplification, and reactions were repeated at least three times. The following sequences of 5′ and 3′ primers were used: calreticulin, 5′-TGTGGGGGCGGCTACGTGAA and 5′-GCCTCATCATTGGTGATGAG; cyclin E, 5′-GCAGAAGGTCTCAGGTTATC and 5′-GTGGCCTCCTTAACTTCAAG; Cox VIIc, 5′-ACCGAAGGAAGTTAGGTGGTACGGCCA TTT and 5′-CATAGCCAGCAACCGCCACTTGTTT; cellular retinoic acid-binding protein 2, 5′-AAGATCGCTGTGGCTGCAGC and 5′-CAAATGGCGGTGGGAGGGTT; β-actin, 5′-GTGGGCCGCTCTAGGCACCAA and 5′-CTCTTTGATGTCACGCACGATTTC; cyclin B2, 5′-AACAGAACCACTCAGGTGGC and 5′-GGCACGCATACGTCCATTTA; cyclin B1, 5′-ACTGCTCTTGGAGACATTGG and 5′-CGTCACTCACTGCAAGGATT; cyclin A2, 5′-TAACAGCATGAGGGCGATCC and 5′-AAGGCAGCTCCAGCAATGAG; thymidine kinase, 5′-CAGCATCTTGAACCTGGTGC and 5′-CTGAGAGGCAAAGAGCTTCC; topoisomerase IIα, 5′-AAGACAGAAGACAGCGGAAG and 5′-TCTGAGTCCACGTTCGGATA; Cox Va, 5′-GGGTCACACGAGACAGATGAGGAGTTT and 5′-AGTCCTTAGGAAGCCCATCGAAGGGAGTTT; Cox IV, 5′-ACTTACGCTGATCGGCGTGA and 5′-GCAGCGGGCTCTCACTTCTT. Plasmids—Mouse Cox IV promoter fragments were generated by PCR from mouse genomic DNA. The PCR primers were designed to amplify 1501 bp (–500 to +1051) of Cox IV promoter: 5′-TGCCGTGGAAGAGCGGGATGCAGTCCACGAA and 5′-TCTTGCCAATCAGGCTCAGCGCTCTGGAAG. The PCR product was cloned into pCR 2.1-TOPO (Invitrogen), and then a KpnI-XhoI fragment was subcloned into pGL3 (Promega) upstream of the Photinus pyralis luciferase reporter gene (pGL3-CoxIVpro). 5′ deletion fragments of the Cox IV promoter (–288/+1051, –193/+1051, +195/+1051, and +821/+1051) were generated using the reverse primer mentioned above with the following forward primers, respectively: 5′-ACCCTCCGCTGCACGCCGTGACGCTCTCGCA, 5′-ACCCGCTCGGCCTTTCGCGACAGTTACCGC, 5′-CTTCCCCGAGCGGGTCTGTTGTCTCGGGTC, and 5′-AGTGGAAGCTTTCAGGCCAGTCCGTGCCTTA. Mutations in the E2F-1 binding sites were generated in pGL3-CoxIVpro using the QuikChange multisite-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene) according to the manufacturer's instructions that changed CTTGGGGC at position –81 to CTTGATAC, ATTCCCGC at position –61 to ATTCATAG, CTTCGCGG at position –49 to CTTCATAG, and GTTGCGGG at position –23 to GTTGATAG. Transcriptional Reporter Assay—Adenoviral constructs expressing E2F-1 (AdE2F1) and green fluorescent protein (AdG) were the generous gifts of Joseph Nevins (Duke University) (33Schwarz J.K. Bassing C.H. Kovesdi I. Datto M.B. Blazing M. George S. Wang X.F. Nevins J.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 483-487Crossref PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar). C2C12 myoblasts were infected with adenovirus or transiently transfected with reporter plasmids using LipofectAMINE 2000 (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's instructions. E2F-1 expression was confirmed by immunoblot with monoclonal anti-E2F-1 antibody (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) using methods described previously (21Hlaing M. Shen X. Dazin P. Bernstein H.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 23794-23799Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). Luciferase assays were performed in whole cell lysates using the dual luciferase reporter assay system (Promega) as described previously (34Lei X.H. Shen X. Xu X.Q. Bernstein H.S. J. Cell Sci. 2000; 113: 4523-4531PubMed Google Scholar). pRL-TK (Promega) encoding constitutively expressed Renilla reniformis luciferase was included in each transfection to normalize for transfection efficiency. Briefly C2C12 cells were transfected with 4 μg of pGL3, pGL3-CoxIVpro, deletions, or point mutants of pGL3-CoxIVpro together with 0.1 μg of pRL-TK, and following 24 h recovery infected with AdE2F1 or AdG virus. For assays to determine the effect of AngII, cells were transfected with the reporter plasmids described above but without adenovirus infection. For all reporter assays, cells were maintained in serum-free media for 36–48 h prior to stimulation with 100 nm AngII. Following stimulation for 12 h, cell lysates were assayed for Photinus and Renilla luciferase activities. Photinus luciferase activity was normalized against Renilla luciferase activity and expressed as relative light units. All conditions were assayed in triplicate, and each assay was performed at least three times. Electrophoretic Mobility Shift Assay (EMSA)—EMSA was performed as described previously (34Lei X.H. Shen X. Xu X.Q. Bernstein H.S. J. Cell Sci. 2000; 113: 4523-4531PubMed Google Scholar). Nuclear extract from asynchronously dividing C2C12 myoblasts were prepared according to standard methods (35Dignam J.D. Lebovitz R.M. Roeder R.G. Nucleic Acids Res. 1983; 11: 1475-1489Crossref PubMed Scopus (9160) Google Scholar). All buffers contained protease inhibitor mixture (Sigma catalog number P2714) and phosphatase inhibitor cocktails I and II (Sigma catalog numbers P2850 and P5726). Wild type and mutant EMSA probes, consisting of 179-bp fragments that spanned the region from –177 to +2 of the Cox IV promoter, were generated by NruI digestion of Cox IV wild type and mutant reporter plasmids described above. The probes were labeled with [α-32P]dATP using the DNA 5′ end-labeling system (Promega) according to the manufacturer's instructions. The wild type and mutant E2F-1 consensus oligonucleotides used for competition experiments were obtained commercially (catalog number sc-2507, Santa Cruz Biotechnology) or amplified from mutant plasmids described above, respectively. 10 μg of nuclear extract protein were incubated with 300 ng of poly(dI-dC) (Amersham Biosciences) for 10 min at 4 °C in a 20-μl reaction volume containing 10 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 50 mm NaCl, 1 mm MgCl2, 4% glycerol, 0.5 mm dithiothreitol, 0.5 mm EDTA with or without a 100-fold molar excess of unlabeled competitor oligonucleotide. After incubation, 105 cpm labeled probe were added, and the DNA binding reaction was continued for an additional 20 min. DNA·protein complexes were separated by electrophoresis on a 4% nondenaturing polyacrylamide gel. Following electrophoresis, the gels were dried, and DNA·protein complexes were visualized by autoradiography at –80 °C. Chromatin Immunoprecipitation (ChIP) Assay—ChIP assays were performed as described previously (36Wells J. Boyd K.E. Fry C.J. Bartley S.M. Farnham P.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 5797-5807Crossref PubMed Scopus (207) Google Scholar, 37Shang Y. Hu X. DiRenzo J. Lazar M.A. Brown M. Cell. 2000; 103: 843-852Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1452) Google Scholar). Briefly asynchronously dividing C2C12 cells were treated with formaldehyde to cross-link chromatin complexes and then lysed in 50 mm Tris, pH 8.1, 10 mm EDTA, 1% SDS with protease inhibitor mixture (Sigma catalog number P2714). Cross-linked chromatin was sonicated to generate fragments of ∼500 –900 bp in length and diluted with 1% Triton X-100, 0.01% SDS, 1.5 mm EDTA, 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.1, 150 mm NaCl followed by preclearing with salmon sperm DNA/protein A-agarose. Immunoprecipitation was performed at 4 °C overnight with either anti-E2F1 antibody (catalog number sc-193, Santa Cruz Biotechnology), control IgG (catalog number sc-2027, Santa Cruz Biotechnology), or no antibody. The immunoprecipitates were washed once with 1% Triton X-100, 0.1% SDS, 2 mm EDTA, 20 mm Tris, pH 8.1, 150 mm NaCl; once with the same buffer except that it contained 500 mm NaCl; once with 0.25 m LiCl, 1% Nonidet P-40, 1% deoxycholate, 1 mm EDTA, 10 mm Tris, pH 8.1; and three times with 10 mm Tris, 1 mm EDTA, pH 8 and then eluted with 1% SDS, 0.1 m NaHCO3. Eluates were heated at 65 °C for 4–6 h to reverse cross-linking, and DNA fragments were purified using the QIAquick spin kit (Qiagen) according to the manufacturer's instructions. The presence of specific promoter sequences was detected by PCR using primers spanning the region –198 to +72 of the Cox IV promoter (5′-CTGCTACCCGCTCGGCCTTTCGCGACAGTTA and 5′-TCCAAGGCCGTCACCTGCCACCGCTGCCCAG) and β-actin (5′-GTGGGCCGCTCTAGGCACCAA and 5′-CTCTTTGATGTCACGCACGATTTC) as control. Genes Involved in Cellular Metabolism Are Specifically Regulated during the Hypertrophic Response in C2C12 Myoblasts—To test our hypothesis that a subset of E2F-1 target genes responsible for cell growth without division are activated during the induction of hypertrophy, C2C12 mouse myoblasts were stimulated with AngII for 12 or 24 h, and total RNA extracted from these cells was used to probe oligonucleotide microarrays containing ∼16,000 unique mouse sequences. Hypertrophy-responsive genes were identified that demonstrated greater than 1.5-fold change in expression (p ≤ 0.05) with AngII stimulation (see Supplemental Table). Consistent with previous reports of expression profiling in various models of hypertrophy (28Friddle C.J. Koga T. Rubin E.M. Bristow J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Physiol. 2001; 63: 391-426Crossref PubMed Scopus (578) Google Scholar), we demonstrated that ∼180 genes regulating growth factor signaling, cytoskeletal organization and biogenesis, ribosome biogenesis, protein biosynthesis, mitochondrial function, cell cycle progression, and programmed cell death were specifically regulated during AngII-stimulated hypertrophy in C2C12 myoblasts. We performed RT-PCR to confirm the expression patterns of five genes (cyclins A2, B1, and B2; thymidine kinase 1; and DNA topoisomerase IIα) with unaltered expression (Fig. 1A) and four up-regulated genes (calreticulin, cyclin E1, cytochrome c oxidase VIIc subunit, and cellular retinoic acid-binding protein 2) (Fig. 1B) as identified by microarray screen. These observations demonstrate the reliability of our system for examining gene expression patterns during hypertrophy. Expression of E2F-1 Target Genes Promoting Cell Division Is Not Altered during the Hypertrophic Response—We have shown previously that hypertrophic C2C12 cells are arrested in G1 (21Hlaing M. Shen X. Dazin P. Bernstein H.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 23794-23799Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar) and expected that expression of E2F-1 targets involved in cell cycle progression beyond G1 would remain unchanged. Indeed expression patterns of known E2F-1 target genes represented in our microarrays and involved in G1/S transit (cyclin A and Cdk2), DNA synthesis and replication (thymidine kinase 1, thymidylate synthase, DNA topoisomerase IIα, proliferating cell nuclear antigen,"
https://openalex.org/W2088712532,"Quiescent cultures of human fibroblasts were exposed to levels of ionizing radiation sufficient to induce a transient growth delay, while causing only small decreases in long term clonogenicity. Following the mitogenic stimulation of damaged cells, cyclin D-associated kinase activity was induced to levels equivalent to those seen in control cultures. In addition, late G0/G1 E2F-dependent transcriptional and translational activity was observed in restimulated irradiated cells. However, cells became arrested prior to entry into S phase in a manner that paralleled the repression of cdk2-associated kinase activity. Cyclin A/cdk2-associated kinase activity was repressed in a biphasic manner following the irradiation of logarithmically growing cells. The initial rapid decline in activity to levels ∼50% of those observed in control cultures occurred prior to increases in cellular levels of p21Cip1 protein, was not blocked by the addition of cycloheximide, and was not accompanied by alterations in cdk2 phosphotyrosine content. The subsequent repression to undetectable levels was coincident with the induction of p21Cip1 and was dependent on de novo protein synthesis. Only a subpopulation of cyclin A complexes were associated with p21Cip1 regardless of the magnitude of the repression of catalytic activity, although all cyclin A-cdk2-p21Cip1 complexes were inactive. These data suggest that temporally and functionally distinct mechanisms mediate the repression of cyclin-cdk activity in damaged cells. In addition, we present evidence that irradiated cells are competent to traverse S phase and arrest in G2 in the complete absence of cdk2-associated kinase activity.

Cell cycle traverse in cultured fibroblasts is regulated by the sequential activation of the kinase activity associated with cyclin-cdk 1The abbreviations used are: cdk, cyclin-dependent kinase; RB, retinoblastoma; FCS, fetal calf serum; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline; PDGF, platelet-derived growth factor; Gy, Gray; CHO, Chinese hamster ovary; MEM, minimal essential medium.1The abbreviations used are: cdk, cyclin-dependent kinase; RB, retinoblastoma; FCS, fetal calf serum; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline; PDGF, platelet-derived growth factor; Gy, Gray; CHO, Chinese hamster ovary; MEM, minimal essential medium. complexes. The subsequent phosphorylation of members of the retinoblastoma (RB) family of pocket proteins allows for the induction of E2F-dependent transcription and the expression of genes required for the traverse of late G0/G1 and entry into S phase (1Nevins J.R.

Cyclin D-associated kinase activity, induced during G1 traverse following a mitogen-dependent increase in cyclin D1 mRNA and protein expression (3Won K.-A. Xiong Y. Beach D. Gilman M.Z. Proc. Natl.

Nature. 1992; 358: 375-376Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). The resulting E2F-dependent transcriptional activity is responsible for an induction of cyclin E protein that, following association with its catalytic partner cdk2, phosphorylates RB on an additional set of residues, resulting in a complete E2F activation and an induction of an additional series of genes including cyclin A (9Lundberg A.S. Weinberg R.A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 753-761Crossref PubMed Scopus (842) Google Scholar). A specific role for cyclin A-cdk2 complexes has not been described. However, based on antibody microinjection experiments (10Girard F. Stansfeld U. Fernandez A. Lamb N.J.C. Cell. 1991; 57: 1169-1179Abstract Full Text PDF Scopus (742) Google Scholar, 11Pagano M. Peppercock R. Verde F. Ansorge W. Draetta G. EMBO J. 1992; 11: 961-971Crossref PubMed Scopus (1106) Google Scholar), it has been proposed that cyclin A-associated kinase activity plays a critical role in the maintenance of DNA synthesis. Traverse of cells through G2 and into mitosis is regulated by the actions of cyclin B-cdc2 complexes (12Ohi R. Gould K.L. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1999; 11: 267-273Crossref PubMed Scopus (163) Google Scholar). Exposure to agents that inflict damage to DNA causes profound alterations in multiple parameters of cell cycle traverse that appear to be mediated to a large extent by modulations in cyclin/cdk expression or activation (13Hwang A. Muschel R.J. Radiat. Res. 1998; 150 (suppl.): S52-S59Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar, 14Shackelford R.E. Kaufmann W.K. Paules R.S. Environ. Health Perspect. 1999; 107: 5-24Crossref PubMed Scopus (221) Google Scholar). The pioneering experiments in this area of research suggested that cells exposed to ionizing radiation largely arrest in G2 (15Yamada M. Puck T.T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci U. S. A. 1961; 47: 1181-1191Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). It has been subsequently shown that a number of pathways, including those regulating the expression of cyclin B (16Muschel R.J. Zhang H.B. McKenna W.G. Cancer Res. 1995; 53: 1128-1135Google Scholar), the phosphorylation of cdc2 (17Sanchez Y. Wong C. Thoma R.S. Richman R. Wu R.Q. Piwnica-Worms H. Elledge S.J. Science. 1997; 277: 1497-1501Crossref PubMed Scopus (1112) Google Scholar), or the actions of gadd45 (18Zhan Q. Antinore M.J. Wang W. Carrier F. Smith M.L. Harris C.C. Fornace A.J. Oncogene. 1999; 18: 2892-2900Crossref PubMed Scopus (391) Google Scholar), converge on the activation of cyclin B-associated kinase activity to mediate the induction of the G2/M checkpoint in irradiated cells. While the expression of wild-type p53 is not required for the induction of a G2 arrest in damaged cells (19Strasser-Wozak E.M. Hartman B.L. Geley S. Sgonc R. Bock G. Santos A.J. Hattmannstorfer R. Wolf H. Pavelka M. Kofler R. Cell Death Diff. 1998; 5: 687-693Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar), the nature of the molecular phenotype of the arrested cells appears to be p53 dependent (20Bunz F. Dutriaux A. Lengauer C. Waldman T. Zhou S. Brown J.P. Sedivey J.M. Kinzler K.W. Vogelstein B. Science. 1998; 282: 1497-1501Crossref PubMed Scopus (2504) Google Scholar, 21Passalaris T.M. Benanti J.A. Gewin L. Kiyono T. Galloway D.A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 5872-5881Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar). A parallel effort has been extended toward an understanding of the molecular basis of the G1 arrest that is seen in irradiated cells under some circumstances. A critical advance in this arena was the observation that an efficient G1 arrest after DNA damage was only evident in cells that exhibit wild-type p53 function (22Kastan M.B. Onyekwere O. Sidransky D. Vogelstein B. Craig R.W. Cancer Res. 1991; 51: 6304-6311PubMed Google Scholar). A potential explanation of the p53 dependence of the damage-induced G1 arrest was based on the identification of p21Cip1, a potent inhibitor of cyclin-dependent kinase activity, as a p53-dependent gene product (23el-Deiry W.S. Tokono T. Velculesco V.E. Levy D.B. Parsons R. Trent J.M. Lin D. Mercer W.E. Kinzler K.W. Vogelstein B. Cell. 1993; 75: 817-825Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (7865) Google Scholar). Based on these data, models have arisen in which it has been proposed that elevated levels of p21Cip1, expressed in irradiated cells following the stabilization of p53, inhibit cyclin/cdk-associated kinase activity (predominantly that dependent on cdk2) directly leading to the induction of a G1 growth arrest (24Agrawal M.L. Taylor W.R. Chernov M.V. Chervon O.B. Stark G.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 1-4Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (644) Google Scholar, 25Fei P.W. el-Deiry W.S. Oncogene. 2003; 22: 5774-5783Crossref PubMed Scopus (407) Google Scholar). While such models have provided a valuable framework for subsequent investigations describing the molecular basis for radiation-induced cell cycle arrests, it has become clear that they remain incomplete. Under some circumstances, there is no direct relationship between the induction of a G1 arrest and p53 status (26Syljuasen R.G. Krolewski B. Little J.B. Cancer Res. 1999; 59: 1008-1014PubMed Google Scholar, 27Little J.B. Nagasawa H. Keng P.L. Yu Y. Li C.-Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 11033-11036Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar). Furthermore, in cultured MEFs the loss of p53 expression leads to a more severe abrogation of the radiation-induced G1 arrest than is seen in cells that express wild-type p53 but that are lacking p21Cip1 (28Deng C. Zhang P. Harper J.W. Elledge S.J. Leder P. Cell. 1995; 82: 675-684Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1925) Google Scholar, 29Brugarolas J. Chandraskaran C. Gordon J.I. Beach D. Jacks T. Hannon G.J. Nature. 1995; 377: 552-557Crossref PubMed Scopus (1136) Google Scholar). In addition, the temporal patterns of alterations in p53 and p21Cip1 levels do not always coincide with the duration of the cell cycle arrest (30Bae I. Fan S. Bhatia K. Kohn K.W. Fornace A.J. O'Connor P.M. Cancer Res. 1995; 55: 2387-2393PubMed Google Scholar). Taken together, these results make it clear that additional, as yet undescribed, molecular events contribute to both damage-induced cells cycle arrests and the underlying modulation of cyclin-cdk activities. Several reports have described alterations in cyclin A-associated kinase activity following DNA damage. When quiescent human fibroblasts are exposed to high levels of ionizing radiation prior to stimulation with serum, the late G0/G1 induction of cyclin A-associated kinase activity is not observed. However, the lack of kinase activity under these circumstances is not due to a modification of cyclin A complexes by processes such as the binding of p21Cip1. Instead, it appears to be caused by a marked repression of cyclin A expression (31Dulic V. Kaufmann W.K. Wilson S.J. Tlsty T.D. Lees E. Harper J.W. Elledge S.J. Reed S.I. Cell. 1994; 76: 1013-1023Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1411) Google Scholar) that we have proposed is an indirect effect of the absence of cyclin D-associated kinase activity (32Savell J. Rao S. Pledger W.J. Wharton W. Radiat. Res. 2001; 155: 554-563Crossref PubMed Scopus (6) Google Scholar). In contrast, the irradiation of logarithmically growing cells that contain cyclin A-cdk2 complexes at the time of damage, causes a rapid loss of cyclin A-associated kinase activity that occurs more rapidly than a loss of cyclin D1 kinase activity (32Savell J. Rao S. Pledger W.J. Wharton W. Radiat. Res. 2001; 155: 554-563Crossref PubMed Scopus (6) Google Scholar). While these observations are potentially consistent with a radiation-induced loss of activity by a p53/p21Cip1-dependent process, it has also been reported that cyclin A kinase activity is repressed in irradiated CHO cells that are null for p53 function (33D'Anna J.A. Valdez J.G. Habbersett R.C. Crissman H.A. Radiat. Res. 1997; 148: 260-271Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). Based on these results, we have continued our investigation of the of repression of cell cycle traverse in irradiated human fibroblasts and report that: 1) at least two functionally distinct G0/G1 checkpoints can be invoked in damaged cells depending on the dose of radiation; 2) multiple regulatory networks interact to impinge on cyclin A-cdk2 complexes to repress kinase activity; and 3) cells are able to traverse at least a portion of S phase and enter G2 in the complete absence of cyclin A-associated kinase activity. Cell Culture—Flow 2000 cells, a strain of normal precrisis p53-positive human fibroblasts obtained from Dr. H. L. Moses, were grown in α-Minimal Essential Medium (αMEM) supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum (FCS) in a humidified atmosphere containing 5% CO2. When logarithmically growing cultures were required for experiments, cells were plated in 100-mm tissue culture plates at an initial density of 5 × 105 cells/dish, fresh medium containing 10% FCS was added 2 days later, and the experiment was performed after a further 24 h of incubation. When growth-arrested cells were analyzed, plates were seeded as described above. Following a 48-h incubation, the cells were rinsed with serum-free αMEM and fresh medium supplemented with 0.1% FCS was added for an additional 48-h period. Cells were irradiated at a constant dose rate of 150 cGy/min using a 137Cs source (Model Mark I, Shepherd and Associates). Flow Cytometry—Cells were detached from the tissue culture plates by treatment with PBS containing 0.125% trypsin and 0.5 mm EDTA. The resulting cell slurry was added to an equal volume of αMEM containing 10% FCS and pelleted by low speed centrifugation. Cells were thoroughly resuspended in 1 ml of PBS, and 4 ml of ethanol were slowly added as the samples were vortexed. Fixed cells were centrifuged, resuspended in PBTB (PBS supplemented with 0.1% Tween-20 and 0.5% bovine serum albumin) containing 10 μg/ml RNase A and 50 μg/ml propidium iodide, and cell cycle distributions were determined using a BD PharMingen FACScan. Cyclin-CDK Analyses—Plates were cooled on ice, rinsed twice with cold PBS, and the cells were scraped off the surface into 1 ml of PBS and pelleted in a microcentrifuge. The supernatant was aspirated, and the pellet was snap frozen in a dry ice/methanol bath and stored at –80°. Cells were thawed for 30 min in immunoprecipitation buffer (50 mm Hepes pH 7.2, 250 mm NaCl, 0.1% Tween-20, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm EGTA, 0.1 mm orthovanadate, 0.5 mm NaF, 0.25 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and 2.5 μg/ml leupeptin), and the slurry was cleared by a 5-min centrifugation in a microcentrifuge. For Western blots, aliquots containing 40 μg of cellular protein were separated by discontinuous SDS-polyacrylamide electrophoresis, and transferred to nitrocellulose membranes. Blots were blocked with PBST (PBS with 0.1% Tween-20) containing 5% dry milk, and PBST containing primary antibodies was added for a 1–2 h incubation at room temperature. The blots were rinsed in several changes of PBST, and incubated for 30 min in PBST containing secondary antibodies. Following a second series of rinses, complexes were visualized with enhanced chemiluminescence. For immunoprecipitations, aliquots of cell extracts containing 80 μg of protein were diluted with immunoprecipitation buffer to a total volume of 350 μl (except for the cyclin A immunoprecipitation/phosphorylated cdk2 Western, where 160 μg of protein was used). The appropriate primary antibody was added, and samples were rocked for 2–3 h at 4°. Protein A-agarose beads were then added and the samples were rocked for an additional 1-h period. Immune complexes were pelleted, and washed twice with immunoprecipitation buffer. When measuring the proteins associated with the primary antigen, the isolated complexes were disrupted by the addition of Laemmli buffer, and processed for Western analysis as described above. Immune complexes to be used in kinase assays were rinsed an additional time in kinase buffer (50 mm Hepes pH 7.5, 10 mm MgCl2, 5 mm MnCl2, and 10 mm dithiothreitol). The beads were then suspended in 10 μl of kinase buffer containing 10 μCi [γ-32P]ATP, 10 mm ATP, and 1 μg of histone H1, and incubated at 30° for 15 min. 10 μl of 2× Laemmli buffer was added, and the samples were heated to 100 °C for 3 min. Proteins were separated on SDS-polyacrylamide gels, and phosphorylated proteins were visualized by autoradiography. Northern Blots—RNA was purified from cellular extracts using an RNeasy Mini Kit (Qiagen) and separated on a 1% agarose/formaldehyde gel. Samples were transferred to Gene Screen Plus, and the subsequent blots were dried and cross-linked with UV. Hybridization in PerfectHyb Plus (Sigma) with a radiolabeled probe prepared with a Prime-It Kit (Stratagene) was conducted overnight at 42 °C. The blots were washed twice at room temperature with 2× SSC 0.1% SDS, twice at room temperature with 0.2× SSC 0.1% SDS, and twice at 42 °C with 0.2× SSC 0.1% SDS, and labeled bands were visualized by autoradiography. Materials—Culture medium, fetal calf serum, and antibiotics were purchased from Invitrogen Life Technologies. All buffers, detergents, and salts were from Sigma. Antibodies against cdk2 and phosphotyrosine were purchased from Transduction Laboratories, whereas the anti-p21 antibody was from Upstate Biotechnology. The anti-cyclin A antisera was a kind gift from Dr. E. B. Leof (Mayo Clinic). Acute Inhibition of Cell Cycle Traverse by Low Levels of Ionizing Radiation—Serum-starved, G0-arrested cultures of human fibroblasts were exposed to increasing levels of ionizing radiation and immediately treated with fresh medium supplemented with 10 ng/ml PDGF and 10% serum. After a 22-h incubation, samples were harvested and DNA distributions were determined by flow cytometry. At time 0, more than 95% of the cells were arrested with a 2N content of DNA. Stimulation of control cells with mitogens caused over 60% of the cells to exit G0/G1 and initiate DNA synthesis (normalized to 100%). As shown in Fig. 1, exposure of cells to as little as 10 cGy caused a small reduction in the percentage of S phase cells, and 75–100 cGy, levels of radiation that cause only small decreases in long term clonogenicity (34Cornforth M.N. Bedford J.S. Radiat. Res. 1987; 111: 385-405Crossref PubMed Scopus (285) Google Scholar, 35Wharton W. Cancer Res. 1995; 55: 5069-5074PubMed Google Scholar), caused a complete repression of short term cell cycle traverse. Modulation of Cell Cycle-dependent Pathways in Cells Exposed to Low Level Radiation—We have previously characterized the cell cycle checkpoint induced when quiescent human fibroblasts are exposed to high levels of radiation prior to mitogenic stimulation, inducing what was termed a permanent growth arrest (32Savell J. Rao S. Pledger W.J. Wharton W. Radiat. Res. 2001; 155: 554-563Crossref PubMed Scopus (6) Google Scholar). Under these conditions we observed an induction of a checkpoint early in the cell cycle, prior to an increase in cyclin D-associated kinase activity. The next series of experiments were designed to characterize the molecular nature of the checkpoint induced when cells were reversibly arrested following exposure to lower levels of radiation that induce a transient rather than permanent growth arrest. The purpose of these experiments was to determine whether there was a single radiation-induced G0/G1 checkpoint that was reversible under some circumstances and irreversible under others (ultimately dependent on dosage levels), or whether any differences in the temporal nature of the damage-induced growth arrests might reflect the induction of mechanistically distinct checkpoints. As seen in Fig. 2A, quiescent Flow 2000 cells contained very low levels of cyclin D1-associated kinase activity. 12 h following the addition of fresh mitogens to control cultures, there was a 3–4-fold increase in the RB kinase activity associated with cyclin D1 immunoprecipitation. Similar to what we had observed before, prior exposure to levels of radiation sufficient to induce a permanent growth arrest completely repressed the mitogen-induced increase in cyclin D1-associated RB kinase activity. Much different results were obtained when cells were exposed to lower levels of ionizing radiation, as shown in Fig. 2B. In this experiment, control cells contained low levels of kinase activity that were increased 12 h following the addition of PDGF and serum, similar to what was seen above. Exposure of cells to lower levels of radiation failed to cause a reduction in cyclin D1-associated kinase activity in mitogen-stimulated damaged cells, even at levels of damage that caused an acute inhibition of G0/G1 traverse. These data suggest the presence of mechanistically distinct checkpoints that mediate the cellular response to either moderate or elevated levels of ionizing radiation. As shown in Fig. 3A, the late G0/G1 expression of E2F-dependent genes was also observed in cultures transiently arrested following exposure to low levels of ionizing radiation. Quiescent cells expressed undetectable levels of cyclin A, cdk2, and E2F-1 mRNAs. 22 h following the restimulation of control quiescent cells with medium supplemented with PDGF and serum there were dramatic increases in the abundance of each transcript. Prior exposure of cells to levels of radiation that abolished short term entry into S phase caused only small decreases in the expression of this series of genes. The late G0/G1 expression of E2F-2 dependent transcripts in cells exposed to levels of radiation sufficient to cause a complete, albeit transient, inhibition of entry into S phase, was paralleled by increases in the expression of the corresponding proteins, as exemplified by the data shown in Fig. 3B. Cyclin A protein levels were low in quiescent Flow 2000 cells. Restimulation of control cells with fresh medium supplemented with PDGF, and serum caused a robust induction of cyclin A protein. Prior exposure to ionizing radiation up to levels of 100 cGy caused only modest decreases in cyclin A protein expression, even though entry into S phase was systematically repressed over the doses of radiation used in this experiment. Western blots measuring levels of either cdk2 or E2F-1 showed a similar pattern of expression (data not shown). In stark contrast to the activation of cyclin D1 kinase activity and the expression of late G0/G1 gene expression in cells exposed to low level radiation, the degree of activation of cdk2-associated kinase activity directly paralleled the ability of cells to initiate DNA synthesis as shown in Fig. 3C. Quiescent cells contained very low levels of kinase activity, as expected since cdk protein is not expressed under these conditions. 22 h following mitogenic stimulation of undamaged cells, robust histone kinase activity was observed in cdk2 immunoprecipitates. Exposure to increasing levels of radiation caused a dose-dependent decrease in the activation of cdk2 kinase in proportion to the decrease in DNA synthesis (Fig. 1) despite the fact that both cdk2 and cyclin A protein expression was observed (Fig. 3B). Cyclin E protein, another component of active cdk2 complexes in restimulated cells was also present at equivalent levels in control and growth-arrested cultures (data not shown). Taken together, the data in Fig. 3 provide conclusive evidence for the presence of functionally distinct radiation-induced G0/G1 checkpoints. As we previously reported, cells exposed to levels of radiation sufficient to cause a marked loss of clonogenicity arrest because of a lack of cyclin D-associated kinase activity, and in the complete absence of late G0/G1 gene expression (32Savell J. Rao S. Pledger W.J. Wharton W. Radiat. Res. 2001; 155: 554-563Crossref PubMed Scopus (6) Google Scholar). In marked contrast, cells growth-inhibited following exposure to more modest levels of radiation, contain levels of cyclin D kinase activity equivalent to that seen in control restimulated cultures, and express high levels of cyclin A, cdk2, and E2F-1. Instead, cultures of cells exposed to lower levels of ionizing radiation arrest in a manner that at least parallels, and potentially is mediated by, a repression of cdk2-associated kinase activity. We next carried out a series of experiments that investigated whether the repression of cdk2-associated kinase activity could be entirely accounted for by the actions of p21Cip1. In order to do complete dose response curves and to measure alterations in kinase activity immediately following damage (as opposed to a long term failure to activate kinases), these experiments were performed in logarithmically growing cells. Effects of Ionizing Radiation on Cell Cycle Traverse in Logarithmically Growing Flow 2000 Cells—Logarithmically growing Flow 200 cells were harvested at regular intervals following exposure to 800 cGy of ionizing radiation, and alterations in cell cycle distributions were determined by a flow cytometric analysis (Table I). Over the first 6 h following damage, the number of cells in the G2/M compartment remained constant, reflecting the rapid and complete inhibition of cell division induced in irradiated cells. During this same period of time, the percentage of G1 cells steadily decreased, due to the somewhat delayed repression of G1/S traverse in damaged cultures. The transient repression of ongoing DNA synthesis following exposure to ionizing radiation, together with the continuing exit of cells from the G1 compartment, resulted in approximately a 70% increase in the percentage of S phase cells by 6 h following damage. Between 6 and 12 h following exposure to γ-rays, the percentage of cells in the G1 compartment remained relatively constant while cells in S phase steadily entered G2.By 12 h the entire population was stably arrested in G1 and G2, a pattern that was maintained for several days after exposure to this high level of radiation (data not shown). This pattern of inhibition is essentially identical to what we had seen earlier with other strains of human fibroblasts (35Wharton W. Cancer Res. 1995; 55: 5069-5074PubMed Google Scholar), and was not accompanied by decreases in total cell numbers (data not shown).Table ICell cycle arrest following exposure of logarithmically growing Flow 2000 cells to ionizing radiationHoursPercentageG1SG2/M04732183414216627532092838381229862 Open table in a new tab Repression of Cyclin A-associated Kinase Activity in Irradiated Cells—Logarithmically growing Flow 2000 cells contained readily detectable levels of cyclin A-associated kinase activity, as shown in Fig. 4A. Within 1 h following exposure to 800 cGy, kinase activity decreased by ∼50% to a level that was maintained for 2 h following DNA damage. Between 2 and 6 h following exposure to radiation, cyclin A kinase activity decreased a second time, eventually reaching levels approaching those observed in quiescent cultures. These data suggest that the modulation of cyclin A-associated kinase activity was biphasic, with an initial rapid decrease followed by a second, more protracted fall. Cellular levels of the cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor p21Cip1 are shown in Fig. 4B. p21Cip1 mRNA levels were low in logarithmically growing Flow 2000 cells. Between 1 and 2 h following exposure to 800 cGy, p21Cip1 message increased, with peak levels seen at 4 and 6 h following damage. p21Cip1 protein was also low in quiescent cells and was increased following exposure to ionizing radiation, although with somewhat delayed kinetics compared with the increase in mRNA levels, as would be expected. Significant increases in p21Cip1 protein were not observed until 2–4 h following damage, after which levels remained relatively constant. Therefore the initial decreases in cyclin A-associated kinase activity following irradiation occurred in the absence of measurable increases in p21Cip1 protein levels, while the subsequent, complete inhibition of activity was temporally correlated with an increased expression of the CKI. It has been suggested (36Mailand N. Falch J. Lukas C. Sylijuasen R.G. Welcker M. Bartek J. Lukas J. Science. 2000; 288: 1425-1429Crossref PubMed Scopus (639) Google Scholar) that an acute repression of cdc25A protein levels regulate a rapid decrease in cyclin E-associated kinase activity in human fibroblasts exposed to ultraviolet radiation. To determine whether the repression of cyclin A-associated kinase activity in damaged cells, such as that seen in Fig. 3A, could be mediated by alterations in cdc25 activity, we measured the phosphotyrosi"
