https://openalex.org/W2111759041,"We have used retrovirus-mediated gene transfer to mark hematopoietic stem cells in vitro and have tracked the fate of these cells after their transplantation into lethally irradiated recipients. Several classes of stem cells are demonstrated, including cells whose progeny completely repopulate all hematopoietic lineages as well as cells that contribute predominantly to certain lineages or to specific anatomical locations. In a majority of recipients, we find that few (1 or 2) stem-cell clones account for the majority of the mature hematopoietic cells. These results coupled with retransplantation studies suggest an in vivo mechanism for the temporal control of stem-cell use. Further studies based on periodic sampling of primary recipients suggest that normal hematopoiesis results from the sequential activation of different stem-cell clones rather than from an averaged contribution of the entire stem-cell pool."
https://openalex.org/W2021272662,"Isolated Golgi membranes incubated in the presence of ATP and a cytosolic protein fraction form a population of coated buds or vesicles from the Golgi cisternae. The coats do not have the characteristic hexagonal-pentagonal basketwork of clathrin, and do not react with anti-clathrin polyclonal antibody. The conditions that produce these apparently nonclathrin-coated buds also reconstitute protein transport between compartments of the Golgi stack. The membrane of the buds contains the glycoprotein in transit through these Golgi stacks (VSV-encoded G protein). This suggests that protein transport through the Golgi stack is mediated by a new type of coated vesicle that does not contain clathrin. The concentration of G protein in the coated buds reflects the local concentration of G protein in the cisternae, raising the possibility that the Golgi coated vesicles may be ""bulk"" membrane carriers."

https://openalex.org/W2070909725,"Involucrin is a keratinocyte protein that first appears in the cell cytosol, but ultimately becomes cross-linked to membrane proteins by transglutaminase. The gene for human involucrin has now been cloned and sequenced. The central segment of the coding region contains 39 repeats of a 30 nucleotide sequence whose ten encoded amino acids include three glutamines and two glutamic acids. This segment must have originated by successive duplications. Later duplications of modified sequences within the central segment can also be identified. Flanking the central segment lie shorter coding segments, a part of which must have given rise to the central segment. The flanking segments also show homology to a simpler 30 nucleotide sequence from which they likely originated. The evolution of involucrin as a substrate of transglutaminase and an envelope precursor was evidently made possible by this process of repeated mutation and duplication."

https://openalex.org/W1506077057,"As reported previously [Vulliet et al. (1985) FEBS Lett. 182 335-339], tyrosine hydroxylase purified from rat pheochromocytoma is phosphorylated at an identical site (site A) by cyclic AMP-dependent protein kinase, the calmodulin-dependent multiprotein kinase and protein kinase C, while the calmodulin-dependent multiprotein kinase also phosphorylates another unique site (site C). Preparations of tyrosine hydroxylase purified from this source are also contaminated with traces of a fourth protein kinase which phosphorylates another unique site (site E). We have isolated tryptic peptides containing each of these sites and determined their amino acid sequences. By comparison of these data with the known cDNA sequence for rat tyrosine hydroxylase, we have been able to identify these sites as Ser-8 (site E), Ser-19 (site C), and Ser-40 (site A). In some preparations of tyrosine hydroxlyase, cyclic AMP-dependent protein kinase also phosphorylated a secondary site which was identified as ser-153. All of these phosphorylation sites are in the amino-terminal region, where there is no significant homology with the closely related enzyme, phenylalanine hydroxylase. Our data also establish that the initiator methionine is removed by post-translational processing to leave pro-2 as the amino-terminus of the mature protein. The significance of these results for the mechanism of action of extracellular signals on catecholamine biosynthesis is discussed."
https://openalex.org/W1509418264,"The soluble form of guanylate cyclase (EC 4.6.1.2) from rat lung has been purified to homogeneity by a one-step immunoaffinity chromatographic procedure. The purified soluble guanylate cyclase has specific activities of 432 and 49.1 nmol of cyclic GMP formed per min/mg protein with manganese and magnesium ions as a cofactor, respectively. This represents a purification of approximately 2,000-fold with a 50% recovery. The native enzyme has a molecular weight of 150,000 and a Stokes radius of 4.8 nm as determined on Spherogel TSK-G3000SW gel permeation chromatography. Sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis results in two protein-staining bands with molecular weights of 82,000 and 70,000. The purified soluble guanylate cyclase was also subjected to native polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, isoelectric focusing electrophoresis, ion exchange chromatography, and GTP-agarose affinity chromatography. These additional purification procedures confirmed the presence of a single protein peak coincident with enzyme activity. The two subunits separated on sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis were shown to have different primary structures by immunoblotting with monoclonal and polyclonal antibodies prepared against purified soluble guanylate cyclase and by peptide mapping with papain or Staphylococcus aureus V8 protease treatment. These data demonstrate that soluble guanylate cyclase purified from rat lung is a heterodimer composed of 82,000- and 70,000-dalton subunits with different primary structures."
https://openalex.org/W1971624034,"Transplantation of normal, immature, fetal hematopoietic cells into a preimmune fetal recipient with a congenital hemoglobinopathy may allow partial reconstitution of normal hemoglobin production without the complications associated with postnatal bone marrow transplantation (immunosuppression and the occurrence of graft versus host disease). In order to test this hypothesis the naturally occurring polymorphism at the Î²-hemoglobin locus of the sheep was used as a marker for engraftment and hematopoietic chimerism. Intraperitoneal injection of allogeneic fetal stem cells into normal fetal lambs resulted in hematopoietic chimerism in three of four surviving recipients. This chimerism has been sustained for 6 months after birth and 9 months after engraftment, without evidence of graft versus host disease, and without the use of immunosuppressive therapy."

Two distinct types of TGF beta receptors can be distinguished based on structural analysis of the 125I-TGF beta-labeled species by peptide mapping. Type I TGF beta receptors include the 280-kilodalton labeled receptor form previously found to be the subunit of a disulfide-linked TGF beta receptor complex. (Massague, J. (1985) J. Biol. Chem. 260, 7059-7066), as well as a 65-kDa labeled receptor form present in all cell lines examined, and a 130-140-kDa labeled receptor form detected only in 3T3-L1 cells. The 280-kDa form is the major TGF beta receptor species in most cell lines examined, but is apparently absent in rat skeletal muscle myoblasts. Type I TGF beta receptors bind TGF beta with an apparent Kd of 50-500 pM. Type II TGF beta receptors include an 85-kDa labeled receptor form present in all mammalian cells examined and a 110-kDa labeled receptor form present in chick embryo fibroblasts. Type II TGF beta receptors bind TGF beta with an apparent Kd of about 50 pM. Except for the 280-kDa type I TGF beta receptor form, none of the TGF beta receptor forms described here is found as part of a disulfide-linked receptor complex. All the TGF beta receptor forms described here behave as intrinsic membrane proteins exposed on the surface of intact cells."

https://openalex.org/W1483437866,"We have systematically characterized, by aqueous column chromatography on a size exclusion cross-linked dextran gel (Sephadex G-10), 12 solutes, 11 of which are known to affect protein stability. Six are chaotropes (water structure breakers) and destabilize proteins, while five are polar kosmotropes (polar water structure makers) and stabilize proteins. Analysis of the chromatographic behavior of these neutral (ethylene glycol, urea), positively charged (Tris, guanidine, as the hydrochloride salts) and negatively charged (SO2-4, HPO2-4, F-, Cl-, Br-, Cl3CCO-2, I-, SCN-, as the sodium salts, in order of elution) solutes at pH 7 as a function of sample concentration (up to 0.6 M), supporting electrolyte, and temperature yields four conclusions, based largely on the behavior of the anions. Chaotropes adsorb to the gel according to their position in the Hofmeister series, with the most chaotropic species adsorbing most strongly. ++Chaotropes adsorb to the gel less strongly in the presence of chaotropes (a salting in effect) and more strongly in the presence of polar kosmotropes (a salting out effect). Polar kosmotropes do not adsorb to the gel, and are sieved through the gel according to their position in the Hofmeister series, with the most kosmotropic species having the largest relative hydrodynamic radii. The hydrodynamic radii of polar kosmotropes is increased by chaotropes and decreased by polar kosmotropes. These results suggest that a chaotrope interacts with the first layer of immediately adjacent water molecules somewhat less strongly than would bulk water in its place; a polar kosmotrope, more strongly."
https://openalex.org/W1489280661,"The developing rat placenta expresses two placental lactogens at different stages of pregnancy: rat placental lactogen I from Days 11 to 13 of pregnancy and rat placental lactogen II (rPLII) from Day 12 to term. In this paper, we describe cDNA clones for rPLII, which have been isolated from a Day 18 rat placental cDNA library. The rPLII clones hybrid-select a mRNA which translates in vitro to a protein of 25,000 daltons. This protein is processed by dog pancreatic microsomes to a 22,000-dalton form, identical in size to rPLII isolated from pregnant rat serum. Both forms are precipitated by an anti-rPLII antiserum and an anti-ovine prolactin antiserum. The mRNA for rPLII is first expressed in Day 12 placenta and reaches a maximum at about Day 18 of pregnancy, in parallel with the appearance of the hormone in serum. Sequencing of the cDNA shows that, unlike human placental lactogen which is 85% homologous to human growth hormone at the amino acid level, rPLII is much more closely related to the prolactins. Thus, rPLII is 52% homologous to rat prolactin at the amino acid level, but only 34% related to rat growth hormone. This is the second placental lactogen to be fully characterized, and in the rat this hormone appears to have evolved by a route quite different from that which produced placental lactogen in humans."
https://openalex.org/W1599507177,"Incubation of clathrin-coated vesicles with Mg2+-[gamma-32P]ATP results in the autophosphorylation of a 50-kDa polypeptide (pp50) (Pauloin, A., Bernier, I., and Jolles, P. (1982) Nature 298, 574-576). We describe here a second protein kinase that is associated with calf brain and liver coated vesicles. This kinase, which phosphorylates casein and phosvitin but not histone and protamine using either ATP or GTP, co-fractionates with coated vesicles as assayed by gel filtration, electrophoresis, and sedimentation. The enzyme can be extracted with 0.5 M Tris-HCl or 1 M NaCl, and can be separated from the pp50 kinase as well as the other major coat proteins. We identified this enzyme as casein kinase II based on physical and catalytic properties and by comparative studies with casein kinase II isolated from brain cytosol. It has a Stokes radius of 4.5 nm, a catalytic moiety of approximately 45 kDa, and labels a polypeptide of 26 kDa when the pure enzyme is assayed for autophosphorylation. Its activity is inhibited by heparin and not affected by cAMP, phospholipids, or calmodulin. This protein kinase preferentially phosphorylates clathrin beta-light chain. The phosphorylation is markedly stimulated by polylysine and inhibited by heparin. Isolated beta-light chain as well as beta-light chain in triskelions or in intact coated vesicles is phosphorylated. All of the phosphate (0.86 mol of Pi/mol of clathrin beta-light chain) is incorporated into phosphoserine."
https://openalex.org/W1635791937,"Mutations in the uncB gene which encodes the a subunit of F1F0-ATPase in Escherichia coli were isolated and characterized. Eight mutations caused premature polypeptide chain termination. Two mutations were single amino acid substitutions resulting in the replacements of serine 206 with leucine (ser-206----leu) and histidine 245 with tyrosine (his-245----tyr). The ser-206----leu mutation does not alter F1 binding and allows ATP driven membrane energization at a low level. Stripping of F1 from membranes containing the ser-206----leu mutation does not render the membranes permeable to protons indicating impaired proton conductivity. The his-245----tyr mutation also blocks Fo-mediated proton conduction but has normal F1 binding properties. F1 bound to membranes with both ser-206----leu and his-245----tyr mutant a subunits is sensitive to dicyclohexylcarbodiimide. Apparently, both missense mutations impair proton conduction without altering assembly of the F1F0-ATPase complex. The direct involvement of the a subunit in proton translocation is discussed."
https://openalex.org/W1601932687,"High concentrations of glutathione (GSH) and two of its constituent amino acids, glutamate and glycine, are normally found in rat bile. To examine the role of intrabiliary GSH hydrolysis as a source of these amino acids, as well as of cystine in bile, the biliary excretion of GSH and free amino acids was measured in normal male Sprague-Dawley rats; in animals given either phenol 3,6-dibromphthalein disulfonate or diethyl maleate, inhibitors of GSH secretion into bile; and after a retrograde intrabiliary infusion of (alpha S, 5S)-alpha-amino-3-chloro-4,5-dihydro-5-isoxazoleacetic acid (AT-125), an irreversible inhibitor of gamma-glutamyl transferase activity. Total concentration of amino acids in normal rat bile ranged from 4 to 7 mM and was more than double the concentration in plasma (2-3 mM). Although most amino acids were detected in bile, glutamate and glycine were the most prevalent (1.2 and 1.0 mM, respectively), followed by the branched chain amino acids valine and leucine. The administration of phenol 3,6-dibromphthalein disulfonate (180 mumol/kg, intravenous), or of diethyl maleate (1 mmol/kg, intraperitoneal), resulted in a marked decrease in the biliary excretion of GSH, as well as a decrease in the excretion of glutamate, cystine, and glycine; however, the effects of these agents were not specific for the amino acid constituents of GSH. Following retrograde intrabiliary infusion of AT-125 (10 mumol/kg), there was an immediate and sustained doubling in the rate of biliary excretion of both GSH and glutathione disulfide and a marked decrease in the rate of excretion of glutamate. Varying the dose of AT-125 (0-20 mumol/kg) resulted in an inverse linear relation between hepatic gamma-glutamyl transferase activity and the biliary excretion of intact GSH. These findings suggest that most, if not all, of the free glutamate in excreted bile is formed from the intrabiliary hydrolysis of GSH. Prior to hydrolysis within the biliary tree, substantial concentrations of GSH must be transported from liver cells into bile; minimal canalicular concentrations of this tripeptide are estimated at 5 mM."
https://openalex.org/W1530270875,"12-O-Tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate (TPA) enhances the apparent maximal velocity of adenylate cyclase in S49 lymphoma cells, an effect that seems not to result from an increased rate of activation of the catalytic subunit by the stimulatory GTP-binding protein (Gs) (Bell, J. D., Buxton, I. L. O., and Brunton, L. L. (1985) J. Biol. Chem. 260, 2625-2628). In membranes from wild type S49 cells, this enhancing effect of TPA is largely GTP-dependent; TPA enhances forskolin-stimulated adenylate cyclase activity by 35% in the presence of guanine nucleotide but only slightly (approximately 10%) in its absence. TPA causes comparable results in membranes from the cyc- variant that lacks the GTP-binding subunit of Gs. Blockade of the activity of the inhibitory GTP-binding protein (Gi) by high concentrations of Mg2+ (100 mM) or Mn2+ (3 mM) abolishes the effect of TPA to enhance adenylate cyclase activity in wild type membranes. The potentiation by TPA of cAMP accumulation in intact cells is greater than and not additive with the similar effect of pertussis toxin (an agent known to abolish hormonal inhibition of adenylate cyclase). Kinetic experiments indicate that TPA decreases the rate of activation of Gi by guanine nucleotide. We conclude that the resultant withdrawal of tonic inhibition of adenylate cyclase is one mechanism by which phorbol esters enhance guanine nucleotide-dependent cAMP synthesis."
https://openalex.org/W2107566021,"To investigate the mechanism of glycophospholipid anchoring of the surface antigen Thy-1, we have undertaken a comparative biosynthetic study using a wild-type Thy-1+ murine T lymphoma (BW5147) and a mutant T lymphoma (class E) that synthesizes Thy-1 but fails to express it on the plasma membrane. Labeling experiments with d-[2-3H]mannose demonstrate that, unlike the wild type, the mutant cells are secreting large amounts of Thy-1 and that the secreted molecules are hydrophilic. Moreover, unlike the wild type, they fail to incorporate [3H]palmitic acid into Thy-1. Both wild-type and mutant cells do incorporate labeled galactose and fucose into Thy-1. We conclude that the lack of surface expression of Thy-1 by this mutant results from the failure to add anchor components to Thy-1."
https://openalex.org/W1506061902,"Glutamine synthetase is encoded by the glnA gene of Escherichia coli and catalyzes the formation of glutamine from ATP, glutamate, and ammonia. A 1922-base pair fragment from a cDNA containing the glnA structural gene for E. coli glutamine synthetase has been sequenced. An open reading frame of 1404 base pairs encodes a protein of 468 amino acid residues with a calculated molecular weight of 51,814. With few exceptions, the amino acid sequence deduced from the DNA sequence agreed very well with the amino acid sequences of several peptides reported previously. The secondary structure predicted for the E. coli enzyme has approximately 36% of the residues in alpha-helices which is in agreement with calculations of approximately 39% based on optical rotatory dispersion data. Comparison of the amino acid sequences of glutamine synthetase from E. coli (468 amino acids) and Anabaena (473 amino acids) (Turner, N. E., Robinson, S. T., and Haselkorn, R. (1983) Nature 306, 337-342) indicates that 260 amino acids are identical and 80 are of the same type (polar or nonpolar) when aligned for maximum homology. Several homologous regions of these two enzymes exist, including the sites of adenylylation and oxidative modification, but the regulation of each enzyme is different."
https://openalex.org/W1593922073,"Liposomes prepared by sonication of asolectin were fractionated by glycerol density gradient centrifugation, and the small liposomes contained in the upper region of the gradients were used for reconstitution of purified, radiolabeled Neurospora plasma membrane H+-ATPase molecules by our previously published procedures. The reconstituted liposomes were then subjected to two additional rounds of glycerol density gradient centrifugation, which separate the H+-ATPase-bearing proteoliposomes from ATPase-free liposomes by virtue of their greater density. The isolated H+-ATPase-bearing proteoliposomes in two such preparations exhibited a specific H+-ATPase activity of about 11 mumol of Pi liberated/mg of protein/min, which was approximately doubled in the presence of nigericin plus K+, indicating that a large percentage of the H+-ATPase molecules in both preparations were capable of generating a transmembrane protonic potential difference sufficient to impede further proton translocation. Importantly, quantitation of the number of 105,000-dalton ATPase monomers and liposomes in the same preparations by radioactivity determination and counting of negatively stained images in the electron microscope indicated ATPase monomer to liposome ratios of 0.97 and 1.06. Because every liposome in the preparations must have had at least one ATPase monomer, these ratios indicate that very few of the liposomes had more than one, and simple calculations show that the great majority of active ATPase molecules in the preparations must have been present as proton-translocating monomers. The results thus clearly demonstrate that 105,000-dalton monomers of the Neurospora plasma membrane H+-ATPase can catalyze efficient ATP hydrolysis-driven proton translocation."
https://openalex.org/W1569529718,"The rat thyroid cell line, FRTL-5, expresses an alpha 1-adrenergic receptor when exposed to thyrotropin. We have found that occupation of this alpha 1-adrenergic receptor by norepinephrine stimulated the release of [3H]arachidonic acid from prelabeled cells. Arachidonic acid was metabolized primarily to prostaglandin E2 and to much smaller amounts of 11-hydroxy-5,8,11,13-eicosatetraenoic acid, 15-hydroxy-5,8,11,13-eicosatetraenoic acid, prostaglandin D2, and thromboxane B2. Synthesis of all these metabolites was inhibited by the cyclooxygenase inhibitor indomethacin. When FRTL-5 cells were starved of thyrotropin for 24 h, norepinephrine nearly doubled [3H]thymidine uptake into DNA. Cyclooxygenase inhibitors inhibited norepinephrine-stimulated thymidine uptake by 60-70%. Of several arachidonic acid metabolites tested, none was able to stimulate thymidine uptake directly in the presence of indomethacin. Prostaglandin E2, however, was able to restore [3H]thymidine uptake when added together with norepinephrine in the presence of indomethacin. Thus, occupation of an alpha 1-adrenergic receptor in a functional rat thyroid cell line leads to arachidonic acid release. Subsequent metabolism of the arachidonic acid by the cyclooxygenase pathway leads to synthesis of prostaglandin E2, which mediates a norepinephrine-stimulated activity related to cell replication."
https://openalex.org/W1512317806,"Mycophenolic acid (MA) was demonstrated to be an effective inhibitor of the growth of the intracellular parasitic protozoan Eimeria tenella in tissue culture and guanine was shown to reverse this inhibition as expected for an inhibitor of IMP dehydrogenase (IMP:NAD+ oxidoreductase, EC 1.1.1.205). A high performance liquid chromatography study of the intracellular nucleotide pools labeled with [3H]hypoxanthine was carried out in host cells lacking hypoxanthine-guanine phosphoribosyltransferase, and the depletion of guanine nucleotides demonstrated that the intracellular parasite enzyme was being inhibited by the drug. Kinetic studies carried out on the enzyme derived from E. tenella oocysts demonstrated substrate inhibition by NAD and mycophenolic acid inhibition similar to that found for mammalian enzymes, but different from that for bacterial enzymes. The inhibition by mycophenolic acid was not time-dependent and was immediately reversed upon dilution. As found previously for other IMP dehydrogenases, an Ordered Bi-Bi mechanism prevails with IMP on first followed by NAD, NADH off first, and then XMP. The kinetic patterns are consistent with substrate inhibition at high concentrations of NAD due to the formation of an E X XMP X NAD complex. Uncompetitive inhibition by MA versus IMP, NAD, and K+ was found and this was interpreted as evidence for the formation of an E X XMP X MA complex. A speculative mechanism for the inhibition of the enzyme is offered which is consistent with the fact that E X XMP X MA readily forms, whereas E X IMP X MA does not."
https://openalex.org/W1568998975,"A mutation of the b subunit of the Escherichia coli proton translocating ATPase was previously described (Porter, A. C. G., Kumamoto, C., Aldape, K., and Simoni, R. D. (1985) J. Biol. Chem. 260, 8182-8187). This mutation, which causes substitution of aspartic acid for glycine at position 9 (basp9), results in loss of function of the ATPase complex. In this paper we describe the isolation and characterization of two mutations that partially suppress the effects of the basp9 alteration. The suppressor mutations cause amino acid substitutions at position 240 of the a subunit. Membranes derived from strains carrying a suppressor mutation and the basp9 mutation exhibited ATP-dependent proton translocating activity."
https://openalex.org/W1485250185,"A transglutaminase from the malignant chondrocytes, rat swarm chondrosarcoma cells, was partially purified and characterized in an effort to understand transformation-induced changes in its activity. This enzyme separated by DE52 column chromatography after extraction from the particulate fraction of cell lysate was found to be distinct from previously characterized transglutaminases in its electrophoretic mobility, molecular size, substrate specificity, and immunologic reactivity. This enzyme was identified as a transglutaminase by its catalysis of amine (putrescine, spermine) incorporation at the carboxamide group of protein-bound gamma-glutamyl residues, and accordance of its kinetic data with the modified double displacement mechanism described for other transglutaminases. Limited proteolysis of the isolated enzyme resulted in a 3-4-fold increase of catalytic activity and a concomitant reduction of molecular size by approximately one-half. Incubation of labeled amine with chondrosarcoma cell lysate resulted in labeling of only a few proteins that appeared to be extensively cross-linked and that were located mostly in the particulate fraction of the cells. Transglutaminase extracted from the rat liver particulate fraction displayed enzymatic and structural properties closely resembling those of the enzyme from chondrosarcoma cells."
https://openalex.org/W2058948293,"In order to identify nucleotide sequences required for efficient and accurate polyadenylation of mRNA precursors, we have constructed a series of mutations in the X. laevis beta 1-globin gene and analyzed transcripts produced upon microinjection into Xenopus oocytes. Small deletion and linker replacement mutations, which lie in the region from 8 to 39 bp downstream of the AATAAA sequence and which effectively remove previously identified second components of the polyadenylation signal, do not greatly reduce the efficiency of processing, but in some cases alter the precise site of cleavage. We conclude that sequences downstream of the polyadenylation site affect the position of 3' RNA processing, but have minimal effects on its efficiency."
https://openalex.org/W1489289777,"The binding of somatostatin-14 (S-14) to rat pancreatic acinar cell membranes was characterized using [125I-Tyr11]S-14 as the radioligand. Maximum binding was observed at pH 7.4 and was Ca2+-dependent. Such Ca2+ dependence of S-14 receptor binding was not observed in other tissues. Scatchard analysis of the competitive inhibition by S-14 of [125I-Tyr11]S-14 binding revealed a single class of high affinity sites (Kd = 0.5 +/- 0.07 nM) with a binding capacity (Bmax) of 266 +/- 22 fmol/mg of protein. [D-Trp8]S-14 and structural analogs with halogenated Trp moiety exhibited 2-32-fold greater binding affinity than S-14, [D-F5-Trp8]S-14 being the most potent. [Tyr11]S-14 was equipotent with S-14. The affinity of somatostatin-28 for binding to these receptors was 50% of that of S-14. Cholecystokinin octapeptide (CCK-8) inhibited the binding of [125I-Tyr11]S-14, but its inhibition curve was not parallel to that of S-14. In the presence of 1 nM CCK-8, the Bmax of S-14 receptors was reduced to 150 +/- 17 fmol/mg of protein. Dibutyryl cyclic GMP, a CCK receptor antagonist, partially reversed the inhibitory action of CCK-8, suggesting that CCK receptors mediate the inhibition of S-14 receptor binding. GDP, GTP, and guanyl-5'-yl imidodiphosphate inhibit S-14 receptor binding in this tissue. The inhibition was shown to be due to decrease in binding capacity and not due to change in affinity. Specifically bound [125I-Tyr11]S-14 cross-linked to the S-14 receptors was found associated with three proteins of approximate Mr = 200,000, 80,000, and 70,000 which could be detected under both reducing and nonreducing conditions. Finally, pancreatic acinar cell S-14 receptors were shown to be down-regulated by persistent hypersomatostatinemia 1 week after streptozotocin-induced diabetes characterized by decreased Bmax (105 +/- 13 fmol/mg of protein) without any change in affinity. We conclude that pancreatic acinar cell membrane S-14 receptors require Ca2+ for maximal binding and thus differ from S-14 receptors in other tissues, S-14 receptors in this tissue also exhibit selective ligand specificities, these receptors are regulated by CCK-8 and guanine nucleotides, three receptor proteins of apparent Mr = 200,000, 80,000, and 70,000 specifically bind S-14, and (v) these receptors are regulated by S-14 in vivo as evidenced by decreased binding in streptozotocin diabetic rats characterized by hypersomatostatinemia."
https://openalex.org/W52034921,"Coagulation Factor V (Mr = 330,000), upon cleavage by thrombin, produces Factor Va, which is composed of two subunits with Mr values of 94,000 and 74,000, along with two activation fragments possessing no known function. Studies were undertaken to assess the ability of the transamidase Factor XIIIa to covalently incorporate the lysine analogs [3H]putrescine and dansylcadaverine into the thrombin-cleaved (activated) and unactivated forms of human and bovine Factor V. The incorporation of either probe into thrombin-activated Factor V proceeded at an initial rate approximately twice that for unactivated Factor V. The extent of the incorporation of [3H]putrescine or dansylcadaverine into activated or unactivated human Factor V was identical; 4 mol of either probe per mol of Factor V. In the case of bovine Factor V, however, while 4 mol of probe were bound per mol of the unactivated pro-cofactor, 5 mol of either lysine analog were covalently linked to 1 mol of thrombin-cleaved Factor V. Polyacrylamide gel fluorography, immunoaffinity chromatography, and immunoprecipitation identified the largest activation fragment of human Factor V (Mr = 150,000) and bovine Factor V (Mr = 120,000) to contain the sites of incorporation of the covalently bound probes. High molecular weight, apparently covalent polymers of Factor V were produced by the action of Factor XIIIa on activated and unactivated human or bovine Factor V. The absence of either probe in the reaction mixtures did not appear to allow an enhancement of protein polymerization."
https://openalex.org/W1534303771,"Substrate determinants for rabbit and chicken skeletal muscle myosin light chain kinases were examined with synthetic peptides. Both skeletal muscle myosin light chain kinases had similar phosphorylation kinetics with synthetic peptide substrates. Average kinetic constants for skeletal muscle myosin light chain heptadecapeptide, (formula; see text) where S(P) is phosphoserine, were Km, 2.3 microM and Vmax, 0.9 mumol/min/mg of enzyme. Km values were 122 and 162 microM for skeletal muscle peptides containing A-A for basic residues at positions 2-3 and 6-7, respectively. Average kinetic constants for smooth muscle myosin light chain peptide, (formula; see text), were Km, 1.4 microM and Vmax 27 mumol/min/mg of enzyme. Average Km values for the smooth muscle peptide, residues 11-23, were 10 microM which increased 6- and 11-fold with substitutions of alanine at residues 12 and 13, respectively. Vmax values decreased and Km values increased markedly by substitution of residue 16 with glutamate in the 11-23 smooth muscle tridecapeptide. Basic residues located 3 and 6-7 residues toward the NH2 terminus from phosphoserine in smooth muscle myosin light chain and 6-8 and 10-11 residues toward the NH2 terminus from phosphoserine in skeletal muscle myosin light chain appear to be important substrate determinants for skeletal muscle myosin light chain kinases. These properties are different from myosin light chain kinase from smooth muscle."
https://openalex.org/W1568172418,"Human choriogonadotropin [hCG] has two dissimilar noncovalently associated subunits, designated alpha and beta. An ectopically secreted hCG alpha subunit that fails to associate with the beta subunit and displays an anomalously high molecular weight on molecular sieve chromatography but not on sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis has been sequenced. A single substitution of Glu56 by Ala56 has been found in the altered subunit. No evidence for conformational differences between normal and ectopic alpha could be found using circular dichroism or intrinsic fluorescence as measures of secondary and tertiary structure, respectively. Hydrophobicity profiles as determined by the method of Kyte and Doolittle (Kyte, J., and Doolittle, R. F. (1982) J. Mol. Biol. 157, 105-132) predicted, however, that the hydrophilic segment, Thr54-Ser55-Glu56-Ser57-Thr58, becomes an extension of the preceding hydrophobic segment when Glu56 is substituted with Ala. This solitary hemoglobin S-like mutation may lead to an altered tertiary structure, self dimerization, or an alteration in glycosylation that could be responsible for the ectopic alpha subunit's failure to associate with the beta subunit."
https://openalex.org/W279815479,"This study is aimed both at characterizing an ATPase activity in rat kidney equivalent to the proton pump described in bovine kidney medulla and at localizing this enzyme along the nephron. Membrane fractions isolated from kidney homogenates by differential and density gradient centrifugations were enriched 7-fold in ATPase activity sensitive to N-ethylmaleimide (NEM). These fractions also displayed ATP-dependent proton transport. ATPase activity and proton transport in vesicles had similar pharmacological properties as both were insensitive to vanadate and ouabain and had similar sensitivities toward NEM (apparent Ki = 20 microM) and N,N'-dicyclohexylcarbodiimide (apparent Ki = 50 microM). Proton transport was dependent on chloride availability as chloride addition to the extravesicular medium stimulated proton transport in a dose-dependent fashion (apparent K 1/2 = 7 mM). NEM-sensitive ATPase activity displaying similar pharmacological properties as proton transport in vesicles was also found in single segments of nephron. It was insensitive to vanadate and ouabain, was inhibited by similar concentrations of NEM (apparent Ki = 15-20 microM) and N,N'-dicyclohexylcarbodiimide (apparent Ki = 30 microM), and is therefore likely to be a proton pump. NEM-sensitive ATPase was localized in all the segments of the rat nephron; its activity was highest in proximal convoluted tubules; intermediate in proximal straight tubules, thick ascending limbs, and cortical collecting tubules; and lowest in outer medullary collecting tubules."
https://openalex.org/W1490237917,"The catalysis of amine oxidation by lysyl oxidase has been probed to assess for the likely order of substrate binding and product release and to discriminate between mechanistic alternatives previously proposed for other copper-dependent amine oxidases using molecular oxygen as a substrate. Lineweaver-Burk plots revealed a pattern of parallel lines when the oxidation of n-butylamine was followed at different fixed concentrations of oxygen consistent with a kinetic mechanism in which the aldehyde is produced and released before the binding of oxygen, the second substrate. Initial burst experiments revealed the ability of lysyl oxidase to form and release n-butyraldehyde in amounts stoichiometric with functional active site content in the absence of oxygen, consistent with the ping-pong kinetics obtained. Reciprocal plots of n-butylamine oxidation in the presence of fixed concentrations of the reaction products were consistent with a Uni Uni Uni Bi ping-pong kinetic mechanism with the aldehyde being the first, H2O2 the second, and ammonia the last departing product. Moreover, spectral studies of the oxidation of p-hydroxybenzylamine by lysyl oxidase indicated that the enzyme does not process the amine substrate to a noncovalently bound p-hydroxybenzaldimine intermediate subsequently to be hydrolyzed to p-hydroxybenzaldehyde. The kinetic mechanism of lysyl oxidase thus appears to be similar to those described for diamine oxidase and pig plasma monoamine oxidase."
https://openalex.org/W1527036234,"The proton-translocating ATPase of the thermophilic bacterium PS3 was incorporated into a planar phospholipid bilayer, and its electrogenicity was directly demonstrated. The enzyme (TF0F1) consists of a catalytic portion, F1, and a membrane-integrated portion, Fo. A short-circuit current of up to 1 nA/cm2 was generated upon the addition of ATP, and the direction of the current indicated the flow of positive charges from the TF1 side to the TF0 side. The generation of the electric current was progressively suppressed by the presence of an inhibitor of TF1 such as NaN3 or adenyl-5'-yl imidodiphosphate. An open-circuit membrane potential of 40-120 mV was also demonstrated (more negative on the TF1 side), which was inhibited by NaN3. Furthermore, an applied voltage of -180 mV (TF1 side negative) was sufficient to prevent the generation of electric current dependent on ATP hydrolysis, which indicated that the electrogenicity of TF0F1 is some 180 mV under the conditions studied. From these results it was tentatively concluded that the number of protons transported across the bilayer/mol of ATP is more than 3."
https://openalex.org/W1564197466,"Somatostatin is a 14-amino acid peptide hormone that is proteolytically processed from its precursor, prosomatostatin, by a paired-basic-specific protease localized in the Golgi apparatus and secretory vesicles. Yeast (Saccharomyces cerevisiae MAT alpha) synthesize an analogous peptide hormone precursor, pro-alpha-factor, that contains tandem repeats of alpha factor (13 amino acids) flanked by spacers that include paired basic residues. To investigate the role of these two pro regions in mediating intracellular transport and processing, cloned genes specific for preprosomatostatin and prepro-alpha-factor were used to generate recombinants encoding hybrids between the alpha-factor pro region (amino-terminal) and somatostatin (carboxyl-terminal). These recombinants were inserted into yeast expression vectors under control of either the native alpha-factor promoter or the inducible yeast PHO5 (acid phosphatase) promoter. Yeast transformed with these plasmids expressed the hybrid messenger RNAs constitutively (alpha-factor promoter) or when induced in phosphate-deficient medium (PHO5 promoter). Radioimmunoassay of culture media revealed the secretion of up to 200 ng of immunoreactive somatostatin/10(7) cells. Metabolic labeling with [35S]cysteine, followed by immunoprecipitation with anti-somatostatin antibodies revealed two forms of hybrid precursor intracellularly, one of Mr 25,000, containing core carbohydrates, and a second of Mr 11,000, which was unglycosylated. Translation of mRNA extracted from these transformants in the wheat germ cell-free system revealed that the Mr 11,000 form was the primary translation product, whereas the Mr 25,000 species could be generated in vitro by inclusion of mammalian rough microsomes. The secreted immunoreactive material was shown to be authentic somatostatin by high pressure liquid chromatography analysis and protein sequencing. These results demonstrate that the yeast processing enzymes recognize these chimeric precursors, resulting in the secretion of the mature peptide hormone."
https://openalex.org/W1545621475,"Translation of the gene for the b subunit of the Escherichia coli proton-translocating ATPase has been examined. Oligonucleotide-directed site-specific mutagenesis was used to mutate certain nucleotides in the intergenic region between uncE (c) and uncF (b). One of the changes was predicted to lower the stability of a proposed stem structure which blocked the ribosome binding site of the uncF mRNA segment. The result of the mutation is a nearly 3-fold increase in the rate of synthesis of the b polypeptide. Another mutation was introduced which changed the initiation codon for uncF from GUG to AUG. This change resulted in an approximately 2-fold increase in the synthesis rate of the b polypeptide. These results suggest that secondary structure in the mRNA and the use of a less efficient initiation codon play a role in restricting translation initiation of the uncF mRNA segment. These mechanisms may, in part, explain how the polypeptides of the ATPase complex are synthesized in approximately the same relative amounts as they appear in the assembled complex."
https://openalex.org/W1505719907,"Mitochondrial F1-ATPase from the yeast Schizosaccharomyces pombe has been prepared under a stable form and in relatively high amounts by an improved purification procedure. Specific chemical modification of the enzyme by the thiol reagent N-ethylmaleimide (NEM) at pH 6.8 leads to complete inactivation characterized by complex kinetics and pH dependence, indicating that several thiols are related to the enzyme activity. A complete protection against NEM effect is afforded by low concentrations of nucleotides in the presence of Mg2+, with ADP and ATP being more efficient than GTP. A total binding of 5 mol of [14C]NEM/mol of F1-ATPase is obtained when the enzyme is 85% inactivated: 3 mol of the label are located on the alpha-subunits and 2 on the gamma-subunit. Two out of the 3 mol on the alpha-subunits bind very rapidly before any inactivation occurs, indicating that the two thiols modified are unrelated to the inactivation process. Complete protection by ATP against inactivation by NEM prevents the modification of three essential thiols out of the group of five thiols labeled in the absence of ATP: one is located on a alpha-subunit and two on the gamma-subunit. These two essential thiols of the gamma-subunit can be differentiated by modification with 6,6'-dithiodinicotinic acid (CPDS), another specific thiol reagent. A maximal binding of 4 mol of [14C]CPDS/mol of enzyme is obtained, concomitant to a 25% inhibition. Sequential modification of the enzyme by CPDS and [14C]NEM leads to the same final deep inactivation as that obtained with [14C]NEM alone. One out of the two thiols of the gamma-subunit is no longer accessible to [14C]NEM after CPDS treatment. When incubated at pH 6.8 with [3H]ATP in the presence of Mg2+, F1-ATPase is able to bind 3, largely exchangeable, mol of nucleotide/mol of enzyme. Modification of the three essential thiols by NEM dramatically decreases the binding of 3H-nucleotide down to about 1 mol/mol of enzyme. Partial modification modifies the cooperative properties, the enzyme being no longer sensitive to anion activation."
https://openalex.org/W1578997517,"Abstract Treatment of the plasma membrane H+-ATPase of Neurospora crassa with the arginine-specific reagents phenylglyoxal or 2,3-butanedione at 30 degrees C, pH 7.0, leads to a marked inhibition of ATPase activity. MgATP, the physiological substrate of the enzyme, protects against inactivation. MgADP, a competitive inhibitor of ATPase activity with a measured Ki of 0.11 mM, also protects, yielding calculated KD values of 0.125 and 0.115 mM in the presence of phenylglyoxal and 2,3-butanedione, respectively. The excellent agreement between Ki and KD values makes it likely that MgADP exerts its protective effect by binding to the catalytic site of the enzyme. Loss of activity follows pseudo-first order kinetics with respect to phenylglyoxal and 2,3-butanedione concentration, and double log plots of pseudo-first order rate constants versus reagent concentration yield slopes of 0.999 (phenylglyoxal) and 0.885 (2,3-butanedione), suggesting that the modification of one reactive site/mol of H+-ATPase is sufficient for inactivation. This stoichiometry has been confirmed by direct measurements of the incorporation of [14C]phenylglyoxal. Taken together, the results support the notion that one arginine residue, either located at the catalytic site or shielded by a conformational change upon nucleotide binding, plays an essential role in Neurospora H+-ATPase activity."
https://openalex.org/W109964576,"Transglutaminase in the rat lung is tightly associated with the insoluble matrix which is not extractable with detergent, 0.5 M NaCl, and 40% glycerol solutions. The insoluble matrix was found to be rich in heparin sulfate and poor in collagen, elastin, and DNA. The lung transglutaminase was found to be distinct from tissue transglutaminase (identifiable with the well-characterized guinea pig liver transglutaminase) in its retention volume in DEAE-Sephacel columns and its Kd value in gel-filtration columns. The enzyme was activated 6-8-fold with the sulfhydryl reagent dithiothreitol. This activation was accompanied with the dissociation of enzyme from the tightly bound insoluble matrix and resulted in changes of the molecular properties of the enzyme--increase in affinity for anion-exchanger and decrease in Stokes radius. Addition of 50 mM KSCN induced a 2-fold increase in SH-dependent activation of transglutaminase activity. These results suggest that sulfhydryl agents may play a role in the activation and compartmental translocation of the transglutaminase in the lung."
https://openalex.org/W1967661839,"The human homology, c-moshu, of the mouse cellular mos proto-oncogene (c-mosmu) transforms NIH 3T3 cells at low efficiency. Furthermore, the c-moshu-induced foci are less distinct, and transformed cells contain a high level of human mos protein. The transforming activity of hybrid mos genes derived from human and mouse sequences reveals three domains within the coding region, as well as a negative regulatory sequence upstream from the c-moshu ORF that reduces its transforming efficiency. The mos C-terminal region, however, which contains the src-kinase homology domain, appears to have the greatest influence on transforming efficiency. The low transforming efficiency of c-moshu may provide a selective advantage to the host, but it also may indicate a reduced or modified function of mos in humans."
https://openalex.org/W1600790124,"Proton translocating ATPases comprise a hydrophilic sector F1, a membrane sector F0, and, in the case of bovine mitochondria, a connecting stalk which is believed to contain the oligomycin sensitivity-conferring protein (OSCP) and coupling factor 6 (F6). The present study was undertaken to verify the accessibility of F6 and OSCP to trypsin and to examine the functional consequences of such treatment. Our data show that F1 binds equally to trypsin-treated F0 and untreated F0, but the former complexes exhibit cold lability and only partial sensitivity to oligomycin. Furthermore, these complexes fail to exhibit ATP-driven proton translocation or ATP-32Pi exchange activity. Trypsinization of F0 does not, however, inhibit passive proton conductance through the membrane sector but actually enhances it. Immunological data indicate extensive degradation of OSCP under conditions where F6 proteolysis is insignificant. Intact H+-ATPase complexes are relatively resistant to both the structural and functional effects of trypsin. We conclude that OSCP is predominantly an extrinsic protein which is shielded by F1 in the native membrane. F6 may also be an extrinsic protein but is shielded from trypsinization by OSCP and/or other F0 polypeptides. The exposed, trypsin-sensitive segments of OSCP are not required for passive proton conductance through F0 but may be required for ATP-driven reactions. We propose that bovine mitochondrial OSCP is a functional analogue of subunit b in the Escherichia coli H+-ATPase."
https://openalex.org/W1547860024,"The rat hepatoma H35 cells in serum-free medium produce tyrosine aminotransferase (TAT) and initiate DNA synthesis and cell division upon exposure to 10(-9)-10(-10) M insulin. This insulin-dependent hormonal and mitogenic stimulation is through the insulin receptors and not through the receptors for insulin-like growth factor type I. We have isolated genetic variants of H35 cells which are resistant to a cytotoxic insulin-diphtheria toxin A fragment conjugate. These variants showed different degrees of insulin binding capacity and exhibited different sensitivities to insulin-stimulated TAT and DNA synthesis. Variant DTaI-b had a slight decrease in number of insulin receptors but completely lost sensitivity to both TAT and DNA stimulation. Variant 11-1 had a reduced number of insulin receptors but retained both TAT and DNA inducibilities. Variant 14-1, which had a high number of insulin receptors, was not responsive to DNA synthesis but was responsive to TAT induction. The beta-subunit of insulin receptors in these cell variants had different sensitivities to their insulin-dependent autophosphorylation. The rat hepatoma HTC cells used as a control showed very low insulin binding, no stimulation of TAT and DNA synthesis by insulin, and no detectable insulin-enhancement of beta-subunit phosphorylation. These characteristics provide genetic evidence for the divergence of the insulin receptor-mediated mitogenic and hormonal signals during the post-receptor pathways which is apparently regulated by the insulin-dependent phosphorylation."
https://openalex.org/W1577853496,"Subunit specific antiserum can be employed to study the course of ATPase assembly in mitochondria isolated from bakers' yeast. Comparing rates of subunit import with rates of enzyme assembly indicated that no substantial pool of unassembled subunits exists for the three largest ATPase peptides (alpha, beta, and gamma). Blocking import of specific ATPase subunits, however, did reveal a possible accumulation of unassembled alpha and gamma subunits in isolated mitochondria. The kinetic experiments also revealed a lag in the import of beta subunit relative to the uptake of alpha and gamma precursors. Experiments conducted in yeast cells confirmed that beta subunit is assembled soon after it is imported, but did not indicate a delay in import relative to the other subunits of F1."
https://openalex.org/W1606105124,"Monospecific polyclonal antibodies that were generated against the beta-subunit of Escherichia coli ATPase (F1Fo) cross-reacted with a protein present in the cells of several Mycoplasma and Acholeplasma species. In Mycoplasma gallisepticum, the reactive protein was found almost exclusively in the cell membrane. This protein had an apparent molecular mass of approximately 52 kDa and could not be released from the membranes by repeated washings with either low or high salt solutions in the presence or absence of EDTA. The reactive protein was found to be catalytically active, exhibiting up to 44% of the total membrane-bound ATPase activity. We suggest that mycoplasmas possess a F1Fo-ATPase which undergoes structural modification(s) allowing its integration into the membrane."
https://openalex.org/W2108238371,"Lauryl dimethylamine oxide activates ATP hydrolysis by the mitochondrial H+-ATPase. Activation is observed in systems with a high content of inhibitor protein as described by Pullman and Monroy (Pullman, M.E., and Monroy, G.C. (1963) J. Biol. Chem. 238, 3762-3769), i.e. Mg-ATP submitochondrial particles and a Triton X-100-solubilized H+-ATPase from the same particles. Detergent activation of ATP hydrolysis is also present in inhibitor-reconstituted systems, i.e. submitochondrial particles, Triton extracts, and soluble F1-ATPase. In submitochondrial particles depleted of inhibitor protein, lauryl dimethylamine oxide induced a biphasic response which is characterized by a drop-in activity induced by relatively low concentrations of LDAO; at higher concentrations the detergent activates to an extent never greater than the initial activity. In inhibitor protein-depleted oligomycin-sensitive Triton extracts, lauryl dimethylamine oxide stimulates ATP hydrolysis to very high values (30 mumol min-1 mg-1). These findings suggest that in addition to the inhibitor protein ATP hydrolysis is controlled by other subunit interactions."
https://openalex.org/W1543384844,"The contribution of the purine nucleotide cycle to renal ammoniagenesis was examined in cortical tubule suspensions prepared from acidotic rats and incubated with [alpha-15N]glutamine, [15N]glutamate, or [15N]aspartate. Labeling of ammonia and adenine nucleotides was determined after enzymatic transformations designed to circumvent the technical problem that 15NH3 and H2O have the same nominal mass. Labeling of the adenine nucleotide was undetectable (less than 10%) even after 1 h of incubation. From the measured concentrations of adenine nucleotides and ammonia and the labeling of the ammonia, the flux through the purine nucleotide cycle was calculated to account for less than 1% of the deamination of alpha-amino groups from all three substrates. The glutamate dehydrogenase reaction is therefore the likely pathway for deamination. The rate of 15NH3 production from [alpha-15N]glutamine was two or three times greater than from added [15N]glutamate, indicating a preference for intracellularly generated glutamate. 15NH3 production from added [15N]aspartate was similar to and perhaps slightly greater than that from added [15N]glutamate."
https://openalex.org/W1599563575,"Resting rat light gastric membranes prepared through 2H2O and Percoll gradient centrifugations were enriched not only with (H+-K+)-ATPase and K+ transport activity (Im, W. B., Blakeman, D. P., and Davis, J. P. (1985) J. Biol. Chem. 260, 9452-9460), but also with a K+-independent, ATP-dependent H+-pumping activity. This intravesicular acidification has been ascribed to an oligomycin-insensitive H+-ATPase which differed from (H+-K+)-ATPase in several respects. The H+-ATPase is electrogenic, apparently of lower capacity, required a lower optimal ATP concentration (4 microM for the H+-ATPase and 500 microM for (H+-K+)-ATPase), of lower sensitivity to vanadate and sulfhydryl agents such as p-chloromercuribenzoate and N-ethylmaleimide, and insensitive to SCH 28,080, a known competitive inhibitor of (H+-K+)-ATPase with respect to K+. Operation of the H+-ATPase, however, appeared to interfere with the K+ transport activity in the light gastric membranes, probably through development of intravesicular positive membrane potential; for example, micromolar levels of Mg2+-ATP fully inhibited K+ uptake and stimulated K+ efflux as measured with 86Rb+. Involvement of (H+-K+)-ATPase in the K+ transport is not likely, since the inhibitory effect of Mg2+-ATP continued even after removal of the nucleotide with an ATP-scavenging system. Moreover, nigericin, an electroneutral H+/K+ exchanger, could bypass the inhibitory effect of Mg2+-ATP and equilibrate the membrane vesicles with 86Rb+ while valinomycin, an electrogenic K+ ionophore, could not. Finally, the H+-ATPase could possibly be involved in the acid secretory process, since its H+-pumping activity was removed from the light gastric membrane fraction upon carbachol treatment, along with the K+ transport and (H+-K+)-ATPase activities. We have speculated that the H+-ATPase is responsible for maintaining the K+-permeable intracellular membrane vesicles acidic and K+ free during the resting state of acid secretion and may contribute to basal acid secretion."
