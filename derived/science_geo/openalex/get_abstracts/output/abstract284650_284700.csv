https://openalex.org/W2006313280,"Downward movement of the water table during both day and night in the short grass zone of intertidal salt marshes is due not to drainage but to water uptake by roots. Removal of water from the sediment results in the entry of air into the sediment, suggesting a feedback between plant growth, water uptake, and sediment oxidation. The water balance of Spartina alterniflora appears to influence the internal morphology of its roots, potentially giving rise to a new mechanism for the mass flow of gas in plants."
https://openalex.org/W2134937688,"Annual growth rings from short-leaf pine trees in the Great Smoky Mountains National Park show suppressed growth and increased iron content between 1863 and 1912, a period of smelting activity and large sulfur dioxide releases at Copperhill, Tennessee, 88 kilometers upwind. Similar growth suppression and increases of iron and other metals were found in rings formed in the past 20 to 25 years, a period when regional fossil fuel combustion emissions increased about 200 percent. Metals concentrations in phloem and cambium are high, but whether they exceed toxic thresholds for these tissues is not known."
https://openalex.org/W2093771956,"A new fossil site near Gilboa, New York, is one of only three where fossils of terrestrial arthropods of Devonian age have been found. The new Gilboan fauna is younger than the other two but richer in taxa. Fragmentary remains and nearly whole specimens assigned to Eurypterida, Arachnida (Trigonotarbida, Araneae, Amblypygi, and Acari), Chilopoda [Craterostigmatomorpha(?) and Scuterigeromorpha(?)], and tentatively to Insecta (Archaeognatha) have been found. The centipedes and possible insects may represent the earliest records known for these groups."
https://openalex.org/W2067258888,"Intraspecific brood parasitism (laying eggs in another's nest) occurs widely in colonial cliff swallows (Passeriformes: Hirundinidae: Hirundo pyrrhonota). In colonies consisting of more than ten nests, up to 24 percent of the nests were sometimes parasitized by colony members. Laying eggs in a conspecific's nest may be a benefit of coloniality for parasitic individuals and simultaneously may represent a cost to host individuals within the same colony."
https://openalex.org/W2009235838,"Fossil flowers discovered in 94-million-year-old clays of the Dakota Formation in Nebraska are among the earliest known demonstrably bisexual flowers. The flowers are of medium size and have pentamerous whorls of clearly differentiated floral parts, petals alternate with the sepals, short stamens are borne opposite the petals, the carpels are fused, and a receptacular disk is present. The pollen is small and tricolporate. These flowers appear to be well adapted to insect pollination. The numerous floral features and pollen characters provide sufficient diagnostic data to assess its systematic position. No extant order accommodates the features of this flower and it shares some features of various extant orders. The classification of flowering plants and our understanding of their evolution must be influenced by the fossilized remains of ancient flowers."
https://openalex.org/W1997479296,"Large sharks (Carcharhinidae, Sphyrnidae), in their natural environment, were attracted to low-frequency (predominantly 20 to 60 cy/sec) pulsed sounds, but apparently not to higher frequency (400 to 600 cy/sec) pulsed sounds, or to low-frequency continuous sounds. The sharks apparently detected and oriented to the sounds in the acoustic far field."
https://openalex.org/W2093732113,Green algae living within gastrodermal cells of hydra photosynthetically incorporate C(11)O(2). About 10 percent of the carbon fixed by the algae is released to the hydra where it is assimilated into animal cell components The specific activity (counts per minute per microgram of protein nitrogen) of hydra animal tissue is 50 to 100 times greater than that of algae-free controls exposed to C(14)O(2). Analyses were facilitated by a new method for rapid separation of hydra tissue layers.

https://openalex.org/W2029385416,A series of five radiocarbon dates obtained from samples taken along the base of the lagoon between the Brigantine City Barrier and the mainland indicates a rate of submergence of 3 meters per millennium between 6000 and 2600 years before the present. During the last 2600 years the average submergence has slowed down to only 1.2 to 1.4 meters per millennium; the general picture of a rapid rise and the subsequent slackening is in agreement with results published for the New England area.
https://openalex.org/W2040523761,"Cutthroat trout were periodically exposed to p,p'-DDT, in acetone solution or in the food. Excessive mortality occurred only in lots treated with high concentrations of DDT, probably as a result of decreased resistance to nonspecific stressors. Surviving fish in these lots were significantly larger than those in the control lot, or in the lots treated with low concentrations of DDT. The number and volume of eggs produced was not reduced by DDT, but mortality among sac fry appeared to be highest in the lots treated with high concentrations. The data suggest that the sublethal concentrations of DDT ordinarily encountered in the environment are unlikely to damage a fishery."
https://openalex.org/W2039482352,"A diagnostic ice-ocean model of the Arctic, Greenland, and Norwegian seas is constructed and used to examine the role of ocean circulation in seasonal sea-ice simulations. The model includes lateral ice motion and three-dimensional ocean circulation. The ocean portion of the model is weakly forced by observed temperature and salinity data. Simulation results show that including modeled ocean circulation in seasonal sea-ice simulations substantially improves the predicted ice drift and ice margin location. Simulations that do not include lateral ocean movment predict a much less realistic ice edge."
https://openalex.org/W2072935367,The standard heats of formation for gaseous xenon tetrafluoride and xenon difluoride and the average strength of the bonds in these molecules have been determined from appearance-potential data obtained with a mass spectrometer. The experimental values are compatible with theoretical estimates of these quantities.

Measurements on ethane, propane, and normal butane indicate that diffusion coefficients can be obtained with a precision of 1 to 2 percent."

https://openalex.org/W2008328423,The absorption spectrum of permselective ion-exchange membranes containing positively charged groups shows specific effects which depend on the nature of the negative gegenion used. Such colored permselective membranes with positive or negative functional groups show increased condutivity after illumination with light flashes. The increased conductivity returns slowly to the original value.

https://openalex.org/W2064572154,Significant quantities of starch accumulation were evident in excised mature lemon fruit tissue growing in vitro on a nutrient solution of mineral salts and sucrose. Positive evidence for the presence of starch in the growing cells was obtained with iodine staining and polarizing microscopy. Starch was observed in all growing cultures regardless of age.

https://openalex.org/W2076510927,"The gamma ray activity of particulate matter filtered from air samples of northerly winds and of southerly winds has been studied during the period October 1961 to May 1963 with a scintillation spectrometer. It was found that the gamma activity at 0.75, 0.49, and 0.145 Mev was greater when the wind was southerly than when the wind was northerly during the months December through May; the opposite was true from June through September. The gamma ray activity was least during the summer of 1962, the decrease being more pronounced for southerly winds than for northerly winds. These results can be accounted for by modifying the Brewer-Dobson theory of stratospheric circulation so that during most of the year stratospheric debris first reaches the ground south of latitude 40 degrees N. No diurnal effect on the gamma ray activity of the samples could be detected."
