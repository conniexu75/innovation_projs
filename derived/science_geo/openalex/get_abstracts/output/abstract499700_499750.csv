https://openalex.org/W2165835468,"Discerning clusters of data points Cluster analysis is used in many disciplines to group objects according to a defined measure of distance. Numerous algorithms exist, some based on the analysis of the local density of data points, and others on predefined probability distributions. Rodriguez and Laio devised a method in which the cluster centers are recognized as local density maxima that are far away from any points of higher density. The algorithm depends only on the relative densities rather than their absolute values. The authors tested the method on a series of data sets, and its performance compared favorably to that of established techniques. Science , this issue p. 1492"

Mak et al. observed the so-called valley Hall effect in a monolayer of MoS 2 . The electrons from different valleys moved in opposite directions across the sample, with one valley being overrepresented with respect to the other. The scientists achieved this by shining circularly polarized light on the material, which created an imbalance in the population of the two valleys. The findings may enable practical applications in the newly formed field of valleytronics. Science , this issue p. 1489"

This is especially true when the cycling changes the crystal structure of the battery components. Liu et al. examined the structural changes in components of a type of lithium battery (see the Perspective by Owen and Hector). Their findings explain why LiFePO 4 delivers unexpectedly good electrochemical performances, particularly during rapid cycling. Science , this issue p. 10.1126/science.1252817 ; see also p. 1451"
https://openalex.org/W2952277428,"Epistatic interactions between mutations can make evolutionary trajectories contingent on the chance occurrence of initial mutations. We used experimental evolution in Saccharomyces cerevisiae to quantify this contingency, finding differences in adaptability among 64 closely related genotypes. Despite these differences, sequencing of 104 evolved clones showed that initial genotype did not constrain future mutational trajectories. Instead, reconstructed combinations of mutations revealed a pattern of diminishing-returns epistasis: Beneficial mutations have consistently smaller effects in fitter backgrounds. Taken together, these results show that beneficial mutations affecting a variety of biological processes are globally coupled; they interact strongly, but only through their combined effect on fitness. As a consequence, fitness evolution follows a predictable trajectory even though sequence-level adaptation is stochastic."

Like many viruses, Lassa virus binds to cell surface receptors. Jae et al. now show that to enter a cell, the virus requires a second receptor, this one inside the infected cell. This requirement sheds light on the “enigmatic resistance” of bird cells to Lassa virus observed three decades ago. Although bird cells have the cell surface receptor, the intracellular receptor cannot bind the virus, stopping it in its tracks. Science , this issue p. 1506"

https://openalex.org/W2158297861,"Making of methane deep underground Technologies such as hydraulic fracturing, or “fracking,” can now extract natural gas from underground reservoirs. Within the gas, the ratio of certain isotopes holds clues to its origins. Stolper et al. analyzed a wide range of natural gas, including samples from some of the most active fracking sites in the United States. Using a “clumped isotope” technique, the authors could estimate the high temperatures at which methane formed deep underground, as well as the lower temperatures at which ancient microbes produced methane. The approach can help to distinguish the degree of mixing of gas from both sources. Science , this issue p. 1500"

Though we might imagine insects “following their noses,” the wealth of odors in the real world can drown out the smell of a flower, making it hard to find. Riffel et al. found that hawkmoths find angel's trumpets by creating a neuronal picture within their antennal lobe, the part of the moth brain that receives olfactory signals from the antennae (see the Perspective by Szyszka). The picture represents both the flower and the background odors. Finding a flower involves a complex reading of both background and target odors, and changes in the background odors—including human pollutants—can hinder the process.

Two teams studied what happens when parasitic worms and viruses infect mice at the same time. Reese et al. found that parasite co-infection woke up a dormant virus. Osborne et al. found that mice already infected with parasitic worms were worse at fighting off viruses. In both cases, worms skewed the immune response so that the immune cells and the molecules they secreted created an environment favorable for the worm at the expense of antiviral immunity.

https://openalex.org/W2102419267,"The Heisenberg uncertainty principle sets a lower bound on the sensitivity of continuous optical measurements of force. This bound, the standard quantum limit, can only be reached when a mechanical oscillator subjected to the force is unperturbed by its environment, and when measurement imprecision from photon shot-noise is balanced against disturbance from measurement backaction. We apply an external force to the center-of-mass motion of an ultracold atom cloud in a high-finesse optical cavity. The optomechanically transduced response clearly demonstrates the trade-off between measurement imprecision and back-action noise. We achieve a sensitivity that is consistent with theoretical predictions for the quantum limit given the atoms' slight residual thermal disturbance and the photodetection quantum efficiency, and is a factor of 4 above the absolute standard quantum limit."

A type of molecular machine known as dynamin is involved in this sort of membrane remodeling. Dynamins use guanosine triphosphate (GTP) rather than the more commonly used cellular energy source adenosine triphosphate to work. Boissan et al. now show that two separate dynamins found in the cytoplasm or the mitochondria both use the same sort of enzyme—nucleoside diphosphate kinases—to provide GTP at just the right time and the right place to power membrane fission.

Pena and Goldstein analyzed the isotopic composition of neodymium in marine sediments from the South Atlantic. The results suggest how the contributions of deep water from northern and southern sources varied across the transition. The boundary between the two glacial states appears to have been marked by a dramatic weakening, perhaps even a shutdown, of deep-water currents. Science , this issue p. 318"
https://openalex.org/W2036616803,"Building coral reefs in ancient times 540 million years ago, in the dawn before the Cambrian explosion, evolution was setting the stage for the global rise of animals. Before they took over the seas, the earliest animals developed strategies to defend themselves against predators. These strategies, which remain common today, include forming skeletons and building reefs. Penny et al. discovered a massive fossil reef deposit in Namibia made up of tiny coneshaped early animals known as Cloudina. The reef, which is 20 million years older than other ancient reefs, was probably formed as the Cloudina adapted to benefit from reefs, which protect the animals and allow them to feed more efficiently.

https://openalex.org/W2109341213,"Mammalian zygotic development is initiated by sperm-mediated intracellular calcium oscillations, followed by activation of metaphase II-arrested oocytes. Sperm postacrosomal WW binding protein (PAWP) fulfils the criteria set for an oocyte-activating factor by inducing oocyte activation and being stored in the perinuclear theca, the sperm compartment whose content is first released into oocyte cytoplasm during fertilization. However, proof that PAWP initiates mammalian zygotic development relies on demonstration that it acts upstream of oocyte calcium oscillations. Here, we show that PAWP triggers calcium oscillations and pronuclear formation in human and mouse oocytes similar to what is observed during intracytoplasmic sperm injection (ICSI). Most important, sperm-induced calcium oscillations are blocked by coinjection of a competitive inhibitor, derived from the WWI domain-binding motif of PAWP, implying the requirement of sperm PAWP and an oocyte-derived WWI domain protein substrate of PAWP for successful fertilization. Sperm-delivered PAWP is, therefore, a unique protein with a nonredundant role during human and mouse fertilization, required to trigger zygotic development. Presented data confirm our previous findings in nonmammalian models and suggest potential applications of PAWP in the diagnosis and treatment of infertility.-"

Polymorphisms in genes regulating inflammation may explain part of the genetic heritage. Methods Using a candidate gene approach, 39 mainly functional single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in 26 genes regulating inflammation were assessed in a clinical homogeneous group of severely diseased patients consisting of 624 patients with CD, 411 patients with UC and 795 controls. The results were analysed using logistic regression. Results Sixteen polymorphisms in 13 genes involved in regulation of inflammation were associated with risk of CD and/or UC (p≤0.05). The polymorphisms TLR2 (rs1816702), NFKB1 (rs28362491), TNFRSF1A (rs4149570), IL6R (rs4537545), IL23R (rs11209026) and PTPN22 (rs2476601) were associated with risk of CD and the polymorphisms TLR2 (rs1816702), TLR4 (rs1554973 and rs12377632), TLR9 (rs352139), LY96 (rs11465996), NFKBIA (rs696), TNFA (rs1800629), TNFRSF1A (rs4149570), IL10 (rs3024505), IL23R (rs11209026), PTPN22 (rs2476601) and PPARG (rs1801282) were associated with risk of UC. When including all patients (IBD) the polymorphisms TLR2 (rs4696480 and rs1816702), TLR4 (rs1554973 and rs12377632), TLR9 (rs187084), TNFRSF1A (rs4149570), IL6R (rs4537545), IL10 (rs3024505), IL23R (rs11209026) and PTPN22 (rs2476601) were associated with risk. After Bonferroni correction for multiple testing, both the homozygous and the heterozygous variant genotypes of IL23R G>A(rs11209026) (ORCD,adj: 0.38, 95% CI: 0.21–0.67, p = 0.03; ORIBD,adj 0.43, 95% CI: 0.28–0.67, p = 0.007) and PTPN22 1858 G>A(rs2476601) (ORCD,unadj 0.54, 95% CI: 0.41–0.72, p = 7*10−4; ORIBD,unadj: 0.61, 95% CI: 0.48–0.77, p = 0.001) were associated with reduced risk of CD. Conclusion The biological effects of the studied polymorphisms suggest that genetically determined high inflammatory response was associated with increased risk of CD. The many SNPs found in TLRs suggest that the host microbial composition or environmental factors in the gut are involved in risk of IBD in genetically susceptible individuals."
https://openalex.org/W1990240889,"Plasma kallikrein (pKal) proteolytically cleaves high molecular weight kininogen to generate the potent vasodilator and the pro-inflammatory peptide, bradykinin. pKal activity is tightly regulated in healthy individuals by the serpin C1-inhibitor, but individuals with hereditary angioedema (HAE) are deficient in C1-inhibitor and consequently exhibit excessive bradykinin generation that in turn causes debilitating and potentially fatal swelling attacks. To develop a potential therapeutic agent for HAE and other pKal-mediated disorders, we used phage display to discover a fully human IgG1 monoclonal antibody (DX-2930) against pKal. In vitro experiments demonstrated that DX-2930 potently inhibits active pKal (Ki = 0.120 ± 0.005 nm) but does not target either the zymogen (prekallikrein) or any other serine protease tested. These findings are supported by a 2.1-Å resolution crystal structure of pKal complexed to a DX-2930 Fab construct, which establishes that the pKal active site is fully occluded by the antibody. DX-2930 injected subcutaneously into cynomolgus monkeys exhibited a long half-life (t½ ∼12.5 days) and blocked high molecular weight kininogen proteolysis in activated plasma in a dose- and time-dependent manner. Furthermore, subcutaneous DX-2930 reduced carrageenan-induced paw edema in rats.

For treatment of acute attacks, these include C1-INH replacement, selective inhibition of pKal proteolytic activity with the Kunitz domain inhibitor ecallantide, or bradykinin B2 receptor antagonism with the bradykinin peptidomimetic icatibant (30.Bork K. Current management options for hereditary angioedema.Curr. Allergy Asthma Rep. 2012; 12: 273-280Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). Prophylactic treatments include chronic C1-INH replacement, which is limited by the need for frequent intravenous administration that can lead to the placement of an indwelling catheter. C1-INH therapy is also associated with a risk for serious thromboembolic events (31.Gandhi P.K. Gentry W.M. Bottorff M.B. Thrombotic events associated with C1 esterase inhibitor products in patients with hereditary angioedema: investigation from the United States Food and Drug Administration adverse event reporting system database.Pharmacotherapy. 2012; 32: 902-909Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). Oral androgens are an alternative prophylactic option that are more convenient to administer but are associated with serious toxicities and morbidities from unwanted androgenizing effects, particularly in women, as well as hepatic adenomas with malignant potential (32.Bork K.

Furthermore, despite chronic treatment with existing prophylactic agents, breakthrough attacks still occur (34.Zuraw B.L. Busse P.J. White M. Jacobs J. Lumry W. Baker J. Craig T. Grant J.A. Hurewitz D. Bielory L. Cartwright W.E. Koleilat M. Ryan W. Schaefer O. Manning M. Patel P. Bernstein J.A. Friedman R.A. Wilkinson R. Tanner D. Kohler G. Gunther G. Levy R. McClellan J. Redhead J.

Med. 2010; 363: 513-522Crossref PubMed Scopus (356) Google Scholar). Thus, there remains an unmet medical need for a long lasting, convenient, safe, and effective prophylactic therapeutic to treat HAE-C1INH. Given the potential for target specificity and long serum half-life with antibody therapeutics, we used phage display to select a potent and highly specific human antibody inhibitor of pKal, DX-2930. Here, we describe the discovery and biochemical characterization of DX-2930, including the x-ray structure of the Fab·pKal complex, which provides a rationale for the specificity and effectiveness of DX-2930. Moreover, preclinical studies reveal DX-2930 to exhibit a prolonged half-life in circulation, and we further demonstrate that this translates into a prolonged capacity to inhibit the KKS. Taken together, data presented here support the potential of DX-2930 for the prophylactic inhibition of pKal-mediated edema and provide a highly specific reagent tool to investigate the effects of targeted pKal inhibition in complex biological samples containing highly homologous proteases. Full-length human plasma kallikrein (prekallikrein and activated pKal forms), 1-chain kininogen (intact kininogen), and 2-chain kininogen (treated with pKal to excise bradykinin) were obtained from Enzyme Research Laboratories. C1-INH and pKal orthologues from rat, cynomolgus monkey, and rabbit plasma were purified by Athens Research and Technology. The pKal catalytic domain variant used in crystallographic studies contained three deglycosylation (N396E, N453E, and N494E) and two cysteine (C383S and C503S) mutations and were purified as described previously (35.Tang J.

Phage isolates were screened by ELISA (streptavidin-immobilized pKal with detection by anti-M13 coat protein VIII), positive hits were DNA-sequenced, and unique Fabs were batch-processed for Escherichia coli expression as isolated Fab fragments from the pMID21 vector as described (38.Wassaf D.

An affinity maturation library was constructed around the lead Fab (given its inhibition of both human and rat pKal) by employing mixed nucleotide synthesis of heavy chain variable complementary determining region 3 (HV-CDR3) where the nominal base was present at 85% and each of the others at 5%. High throughput production of E. coli-secreted Fabs and their subsequent purification by protein A-Sepharose followed previously reported protocols (38.Wassaf D. Kuang G. Kopacz K. Wu Q.L. Nguyen Q.

The DX-2930 Fab construct generated for crystallization studies was produced as follows. The DNA sequence for the DX-2930 Fab region was codon-optimized and cloned into the pJexpress 401 expression vector by DNA2.0. SS320 TG1 E. coli cells (Lucigen) were transformed with the Fab expression vector and grown in 10 ml of TBDry media containing 2% glucose and 25 μg/ml kanamycin for 18 h at 30 °C. 10 liters of TBDry media containing 0.1% glucose and 25 μg/ml kanamycin was then inoculated with 10 ml of the starter culture (1:1000 ratio) and grown for 20 h at 30 °C. Cells were harvested by centrifugation (15 min at 2000 × g); the pellet resuspended in 10 liters with TBDry media containing 25 μg/ml kanamycin, 1 mm isopropyl 1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside, and 0.5% Triton X-100, and incubated an additional 20 h at 30 °C with shaking. The culture was finally harvested by spinning at 9000 × g for 30 min and filtered through a Corning 0.22-μm PES filter. The resulting culture supernatant containing secreted Fab protein was subjected to a three-step chromatography purification. Fab product was first captured by immunoaffinity protein A resin (RepliGen). 80 ml of immobilized protein A resin was added to the 10 liters of filtered supernatant and incubated with rocking for 18 h at 4 °C. Resin was captured in a fritted column and extensively washed to remove host cell-related impurities and reduce endotoxin level. Washes successively included 10 column volumes (cv) of PBS, 20 cv of Fab Wash Buffer (50 mm sodium acetate, 0.5 m sodium chloride, pH 5.0), 50 cv of PBS with 0.1% Triton X-100, and then a final wash with 50 cv PBS. Soluble Fab (sFab) was then eluted from protein A with 6 cv of Fab elution buffer (50 mm sodium phosphate, 150 mm sodium chloride, pH 2.5) and instantly neutralized to pH 6.0 with 2 cv equivalents of 1 m HEPES, pH 7.2. Neutralized protein A eluate was loaded onto PBS pre-equilibrated mercaptoethylpyridine HyperCel resin (Pall Lifesciences) and incubated overnight at 4 °C with rocking. Mercaptoethylpyridine resin was then washed with 10 cv of PBS, followed by step elutions with 50 mm sodium acetate solutions at varying pH values from pH 5 to pH 3. The major elution peak at pH 5 was collected and directly loaded onto a POROS HS 50 strong CEX resin (Invitrogen) pre-equilibrated with 50 mm sodium acetate, pH 4.5 (“CEX Buffer”), washed first with the same CEX Buffer, and then an additional wash with CEX Buffer + 250 mm NaCl. Fab was subsequently eluted with CEX Buffer + 350 mm NaCl. Purified Fab product was exchanged into a buffer containing 50 mm citrate/phosphate, 100 mm NaCl, pH 6.0, through an ultrafiltration/diafiltration process using a Millipore Amicon Ultra concentration unit (10,000-kDa molecular mass cutoff). Recombinant Fab fragments were reformatted into full-length human IgG1 antibodies (f-allotype) (39.Jostock T. Vanhove M. Brepoels E. Van Gool R. Daukandt M. Wehnert A. Van Hegelsom R. Dransfield D.

https://openalex.org/W2034741032,"4'-Ethynyl-2-fluoro-2'-deoxyadenosine (EFdA) is a nucleoside analog that, unlike approved anti-human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors, has a 3'-OH and exhibits remarkable potency against wild-type and drug-resistant HIVs. EFdA triphosphate (EFdA-TP) is unique among nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors because it inhibits HIV-1 reverse transcriptase (RT) with multiple mechanisms. (a) EFdA-TP can block RT as a translocation-defective RT inhibitor that dramatically slows DNA synthesis, acting as a de facto immediate chain terminator. Although non-translocated EFdA-MP-terminated primers can be unblocked, they can be efficiently converted back to the EFdA-MP-terminated form. (b) EFdA-TP can function as a delayed chain terminator, allowing incorporation of an additional dNTP before blocking DNA synthesis. In such cases, EFdA-MP-terminated primers are protected from excision. (c) EFdA-MP can be efficiently misincorporated by RT, leading to mismatched primers that are extremely hard to extend and are also protected from excision. The context of template sequence defines the relative contribution of each mechanism and affects the affinity of EFdA-MP for potential incorporation sites, explaining in part the lack of antagonism between EFdA and tenofovir. Changes in the type of nucleotide before EFdA-MP incorporation can alter its mechanism of inhibition from delayed chain terminator to immediate chain terminator. The versatility of EFdA in inhibiting HIV replication by multiple mechanisms may explain why resistance to EFdA is more difficult to emerge."
https://openalex.org/W2093788957,"Innate monocytes and macrophages can be dynamically programmed into distinct states depending upon the strength of external stimuli. Innate programming may bear significant relevance to the pathogenesis and resolution of human inflammatory diseases. However, systems analyses with regard to the dynamic programming of innate leukocytes are lacking. In this study, we focused on the dynamic responses of human promonocytic THP-1 cells to lipopolysaccharide (LPS). We observed that varying dosages of LPS differentially modulate the expression of selected pro- and anti- inflammatory mediators such as IL-6 and IL-33. Super-low dosages of LPS preferentially induced the pro-inflammatory mediator IL-6, while higher dosages of LPS induced both IL-6 and IL-33. Mechanistically, we demonstrated that super-low and high doses of LPS cause differential activation of GSK3 and Akt, as well as the transcription factors FoxO1 and CREB. Inhibition of GSK3 enabled THP-1 cells to express IL-33 when challenged with super-low dose LPS. On the other hand, activation of CREB with adenosine suppressed IL-6 expression. Taken together, our study reveals a dynamic modulation of monocytic cells in response to varying dosages of endotoxin, and may shed light on our understanding of the dynamic balance that controls pathogenesis and resolution of inflammatory diseases."

Phosphorylation of serine residues i.e. Ser-303–304, Ser-310, Ser-315, Ser-320, and Ser-328 within the AIR results in AIR destabilization, which exposes the sSH3 groove for p22phox to bind and to activate NADPH oxidase (14.Groemping Y.

However, the molecular mechanism of how a single serine (Ser-379) phosphorylation can promote NADPH oxidase activation is unknown. In the current study, we have generated, for the first time, an in silico model of the complete p47phox protein structure and shown the importance of the C-terminal tail in stabilizing the p47phox structure at rest. We have demonstrated step by step the phosphorylation-induced p47phox conformational changes and protein/protein interactions with p22phox by molecular dynamics. The in silico results were further confirmed by site-directed mutagenesis and gene transfection of p47phox−/− cells. Our study has discovered a molecular switch in initiating p47phox activation and revealed an important mechanism for how p47phox becomes activated from partial to full opening of the sSH3 groove for p22phox binding and O2⨪ production by NADPH oxidase. The auto-inhibited p47phox (1–390 amino acids) model was generated based on three available crystal structures i.e. the N-terminal PX domain (residues 1–141, PDB: 1KQ6); the p47phox PRR domain (residues 359–390, PDB: 1K4U) (19.Kami K. Takeya R. Sumimoto H. Kohda D.

The missing linking segments (142-MKDGKSTATDITGPII-156 and 340-PGPQSPGSPLEEERQTQRSK-360) were generated using the web-based homology protein modeling server Phyre2 as described previously (20.Jefferys B.R.

Cell Biol. 2011; 89: 225-230Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). Briefly, the short residue sequences were uploaded to the server, and underwent template identification and structure refinement. The subsequent Phyre2 models scored 50 and 90% structure confidences, respectively, which satisfied structural motifs predicted by SWISS-MODEL (23.Schwede T. Kopp J. Guex N. Peitsch M.C. SWISS-MODEL: An automated protein homology-modeling server.Nucleic Acids Res. 2003; 31: 3381-3385Crossref PubMed Scopus (4492) Google Scholar) and PHDsec (24.Rost B. Sander C. Conservation and prediction of solvent accessibility in protein families.Proteins. 1994; 20: 216-226Crossref PubMed Scopus (538) Google Scholar). The generated Phyre2 linking peptides had 5 residue extensions at both the N- and C-terminal sides to superimpose with the corresponding ends of the protein crystal structures, and the protein backbones were joined together manually in molecular operating environment (MOE; Chemical Computing Group Inc., Canada). The final model of the full p47phox protein (a.a.1–390) was constructed using the protein homology modeling function in MOE, and was refined by energy minimization using the AMBER99 force field as described previously (25.Meijles D. Howlin B.J. Li J.-M. Consensus in silico computational modelling of the p22phox subunit of the NADPH oxidase.Comput. Biol. Chem. 2012; 39: 6-13Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). The secondary structure, residue contacts and water affinities of the energy minimized models were analyzed using the protein geometry function in MOE. The stereochemical qualities of the models were assessed by using Ramachandran plot analysis and structural analysis using the protein report function in MOE. This searches for disallowed bond angles, bond lengths and side chain rotamers. There were no unacceptable deviations in the models with less than 2 outliers in the Ramachandran plot. The effect of phosphorylation-induced p47phox conformational changes was investigated in silico by adding a phosphate group (PO43−) to the side-chain of each serine residue of Ser-303, Ser-304, Ser-310, Ser-315, Ser-320, Ser-328, Ser-345, Ser-348, Ser-359, Ser-370, and Ser-379 using the molecular builder function of MOE. The phosphorylated p47phox model then underwent energy minimization for structural refinement to correct any potential disallowed bond angles, bond lengths and unfavorable torsion angles following PO43− addition. The p47phox conformational changes associated with serine phosphorylation were studied by molecular dynamics (MD). Prior to MD simulation the protein was prepared by addition of missing hydrogen atoms which were unable to be located in low resolution protein x-ray structures. The hydrogen atoms were added at positions calculated using the Protonate 3-dimensional module of MOE. Next, the protein was solvated in a square-box of water, which was positioned randomly to occupy the volume using the solvate module in MOE. Finally, sodium ions were added to the simulation box to balance charges, and followed by energy minimization to remove any high energy interactions or van der Waals violations. The MD simulation was recorded every 0.5 picoseconds (ps) at a constant temperature of 310K for 500 ps, with a time step of 0.002 ps. The algorithm employed was the Nosé-Poincaré-Anderson with an NPT ensemble. The force field used was AMBER99 with a distance-dependent dielectric of 4 for the protein and 80 for the solvent. This resulted in a stable simulation after initial equilibration of the structure under calculated conditions. The simulation was considered to have been equilibrated after the first 100 ps. The NPA Hamiltonian used in MOE is shown in Equations 1 and 2, H(t)=s[H˜(t)- H˜(t)](Eq. 1) H˜(t)=u⋅M−1u2s2V2/3+u22QP+V22QP+U(V1/3q)+gkTlogs+PV(Eq. 2) where g is the number of degrees of freedom in the atomic system plus one if V is not fixed. The s coordinate is a time scaling coordinate used to enforce constant temperature. The quantity H is conserved, and the equations of motion can be derived by differentiating H with respect to the conjugate coordinates and momenta to obtain the equations of motion. q˙=s−1V−2/3M−1uu˙=sV−1/3∇U(r)r=V1/3s˙=su/QTu˙=2k−gkT−H˜(t)+H˜(0)2K=u⋅M−1us−2V−2/3V˙=sv/Qpv˙=s[(2K−W)/3V−P]W=r⋅∇U(r)(Eq. 3) To solve these equations, the symplectic, time-reversible Generalized Leapfrog Algorithm is used. A Hamiltonian, H (p,q) in which q are the coordinates and p the conjugate momenta at time t can be integrated through a time step h with (Eq. 4), (Eq. 5), (Eq. 6), pt+h/2=pt−h2∂H∂q(pt+h/2,qt)(Eq. 4) qt+h=qt+h2∂H∂q(pt+h/2,qt)+∂H∂q(pt+h/2,qt)(Eq. 5) pt+h/2=pt+h/2−h2∂H∂q(pt+h/2,qt+h)(Eq. 6) which is a concatenation of the Symplectic Euler method with its adjoint (its reverse time analog) (see the MOE user manual). Protein docking is a well-established technique for probing the proteome or interactome (26.Wass M.N. Fuentes G. Pons C. Pazos F. Valencia A. Towards the prediction of protein interaction partners using physical docking.Mol. Syst. Biol. 2012; 7 (469-10.1038/msb.2011.3)Google Scholar). Protein-protein interaction between the p47phox sSH3 domain and the p22phox PRR domain was examined by molecular docking using MOE. A 1.80Å resolution x-ray structure of the p22phox (14.Groemping Y. Lapouge K. Smerdon S.J. Rittinger K. Molecular basis of phosphorylation-induced activation of the NADPH oxidase.Cell. 2003; 113: 343-355Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (315) Google Scholar) PRR was positioned near to the AIR region before and after phosphorylation and the molecular dynamics was re run for 500 ps to see if the p22phox peptide would migrate into the p47phox sSH3 binding groove. This dynamics simulation was followed by energy minimization to convergence. The resulting root mean squared deviation (RMSD) following MD when compared with the orientation of the crystallized p22phox peptide was 1.676Å, and the peptide interacted successfully with the p47phox in the sSH3 binding groove. The substitution of serine (S) by alanine (A) in human p47phox cDNA (GenBankTM: AF330627.1) was performed exactly as described previously using the QuikChange Multi Site-directed Mutagenesis kit (Agilent Technologies) (18.Teng L. Fan L.M. Meijles D. Li J.-M. Divergent effects of p47phox phosphorylation at S303–4 or S379 on tumor necrosis factor-α signaling via TRAF4 and MAPK in endothelial cells.Arterioscler. Thromb. Vasc. Biol. 2012; 32: 1488-1496Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). Briefly, Wild-type p47phox cDNA was cloned into pcDNA3.1/Zeovector (Invitrogen) and used for the mutagenesis. Mutated p47phox cDNAs were then sequenced and cloned into Escherichia coli, DH5α (Invitrogen) (18.Teng L. Fan L.M. Meijles D. Li J.-M.

Biol. 2012; 32: 1488-1496Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). The plasmids were purified for gene transfection. The p47phox knock-out (KO) mice on a 129sv background were obtained from the European Mouse Mutant Archive, and backcrossed to C57BL/6J for 10 generations. All studies were performed in accordance with protocols approved by the Home Office under the Animals (Scientific Procedures) Act 1986 UK. The p47phox−/− coronary microvascular endothelial cells (CMEC) were isolated from the hearts of 10–12 week-old p47phox KO mice as described previously (18.Teng L. Fan L.M. Meijles D. Li J.-M.

Fan L.M. Meijles D. Li J.-M. Divergent effects of p47phox phosphorylation at S303–4 or S379 on tumor necrosis factor-α signaling via TRAF4 and MAPK in endothelial cells.Arterioscler. Thromb. Vasc. Biol. 2012; 32: 1488-1496Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). After 48 h of gene transfection, cells were treated with vehicle, or with phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate (PMA, Sigma) 100 ng/ml for 30 min to activate the NADPH oxidase. Cells were used immediately for ROS measurement and cell membrane isolation. The cell membrane protein fraction was prepared in MOPS-KOH buffer (MOPS-KOH 20 mmol/liter, sucrose 250 mmol/liter, pH 7.4) containing PMSF (1 mmol/liter), EDTA (0.1 mmol/liter), sodium fluoride (50 mmol/liter), sodium vanadate (2 mmol/liter), leupeptin (2 μmol/liter), and pepstatin (2 μmol/liter). The fractions of cell nuclei, mitochondria, submitochondria, and small organelles were eliminated by sequential ultracentrifugation as described previously (11.Li J.-M. Fan L.M. Christie M.R. Shah A.M. Acute tumor necrosis factor alpha signaling via NADPH oxidase in microvascular endothelial cells: role of p47phox phosphorylation and binding to TRAF4.Mol. Cell. Biol. 2005; 25: 2320-2330Crossref PubMed Scopus (187) Google Scholar), and the final pellet of membrane fraction was obtained after 60 min of centrifugation at 100,000 × g. Membrane proteins were analyzed for NADPH-dependent oxidase activity by lucigenin chemiluminescence or used for immunoblotting. Immunoprecipitation of p47phox was performed as described previously (18.Teng L. Fan L.M. Meijles D. Li J.-M. Divergent effects of p47phox phosphorylation at S303–4 or S379 on tumor necrosis factor-α signaling via TRAF4 and MAPK in endothelial cells.Arterioscler. Thromb. Vasc. Biol. 2012; 32: 1488-1496Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). Subsequent immunoblotting was performed using either phospho-serine specific monoclonal antibody for p47phox phosphorylation or antibody to p22phox for their association. For quantification of phos-p47phox or p22phox pulled-down with p47phox, the levels of total p47phox detected in the same sample were used as loading controls. The O2⨪ production was measured by lucigenin (5 μmol/liter)-chemiluminescence as described previously (28.Fan L.M. Li J.M.

Biol. 2009; 29: 1651-1656Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). NADPH (100 μm) was added into the cell homogenates as substrate for the detection of NADPH-dependent O2⨪ production. The specificity of O2⨪ detection was confirmed by tiron (5 mmol/liter, an O2⨪ scavenger). Potential enzymatic sources of O2⨪ production were verified using inhibitors: rotenone (100 μmol/liter), oxypurinol (100 μmol/liter), or diphenyleneiodonium (DPI, 20 μmol/liter). As an independent approach, the intracellular ROS production by adherent cells was examined by 5-(and 6)-chloromethyl-2′,7′-dichlorodrofluorescein diacetate (DCF, Invitrogen) (28.Fan L.M. Li J.M. Evaluation of methods of detecting cell reactive oxygen species production for drug screening and cell cycle studies.J. Pharmacol. Toxicol. Methods. 2014; 70: 40-47Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). Briefly, cells cultured onto chamber slides were incubated with 5 μmol/liter of DCF in Hanks' buffer for 15 min at 37 °C with or without PMA stimulation. DCF fluorescence at an excitatory wavelength of 495 nm was immediately acquired using Olympus BX61 fluorescence microscopy. Fluorescence intensity was quantified from at least 3 random fields (269.7 × 269.2 μm) per chamber, >1000 cells assessed per cell culture experiment, and at least 3 separated cell cultures per condition. Tiron (10 mmol/liter), a cell membrane permeable non-enzymatic scavenger of O2⨪ was used to verify the detection of O2⨪ (29.Fan L.M. Teng L. Li J.-M. Knockout of p47phox uncovers a critical role of p40phox in reactive oxygen species production in microvascular endothelial cells.Arterioscler. Thromb. Vasc.

Divergent effects of p47phox phosphorylation at S303–4 or S379 on tumor necrosis factor-α signaling via TRAF4 and MAPK in endothelial cells.Arterioscler. Thromb. Vasc. Biol. 2012; 32: 1488-1496Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). Antibody binding was detected by extravidin-FITC (green) or streptavidin-Cy3 (red). Normal rabbit or goat IgG (5 μg/ml) were used instead of primary antibody as negative controls. Images were acquired with an Olympus BX61 fluorescence microscope system as described previously (30.Du J. Fan L.M. Mai A. Li J.-M. Crucial roles of Nox2-derived oxidative stress in deteriorating the function of insulin receptor and endothelium in dietary obesity of middle-aged mice.Br. J. Pharmacol. 2013; 170: 1064-1077Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). For the in vitro studies, data were presented as means±S.D. of results taken from at least 3 independent cell cultures/per condition. In the case of CMEC, each isolation used 6 mice/per group, and the data presented were the mean from at least 3 isolations. Comparisons were made by one-way ANOVA with Bonferroni test analysis, and p < 0.05 was considered statistically significant. To produce a reliable structural model of the full p47phox protein, we initially generated computational models from three available crystal structures of the p47phox functional domains: the PX-domain (a.a 1–141, 1KQ6), the sSH3/AIR-domain (a.a. 159–340, 1NG2), and the PRR domain (a.a. 359–390, 1K4U) (Fig. 1, a and b). Two missing linking peptides (142-MKDGKSTATDITGPII-156 and 340-PGPQSPGSPLEEERQTQRSK-360) between these structures were generated using the homology modeling server Phyre2 with a 50 and 90% structural confidence, respectively. A full p47phox structure of the auto-inhibited form was generated using the in silico homology modeling technique (Fig. 1c). The structure has no distorted torsion angles or residues in disallowed regions as analyzed using a Ramachandran plot (Fig. 1d), and all internal hydrogen-bonds were optimally occupied as an independent measure of structural reliability. Furthermore, the generated p47phox structure is extended rather than globular, with a radius of gyration in the same order of magnitude that was published previously in a study employing small angle x-ray scattering (31.Durand D. Cannella D. Dubosclard V. Pebay-Peyroula E. Vachette P. Fieschi F. Small-angle X-ray scattering reveals an extended organization for the autoinhibitory resting state of the p47(phox) modular protein.Biochemistry. 2006; 45: 7185-7193Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). To examine the conformational changes in the p47phox structure toward the C terminus, the PX domain was omitted, and the rest of the structure (a.a. 156–390) was subjected to MD simulation (Fig. 2). We found that without phosphorylation, the auto-inhibited p47phox model remained stable over the MD time course (post-equilibration,"
https://openalex.org/W2006523830,"In our previous work, using a fluorescent adenosine-A3 receptor (A3AR) agonist and fluorescence correlation spectroscopy (FCS), we demonstrated high-affinity labeling of the active receptor (R∗) conformation. In the current study, we used a fluorescent A3AR antagonist (CA200645) to study the binding characteristics of antagonist-occupied inactive receptor (R) conformations in membrane microdomains of individual cells. FCS analysis of CA200645-occupied A3ARs revealed 2 species, τD2 and τD3, that diffused at 2.29 ± 0.35 and 0.09 ± 0.03 μm2/s, respectively. FCS analysis of a green fluorescent protein (GFP)-tagged A3AR exhibited a single diffusing species (0.105 μm2 /s). The binding of CA200645 to τD3 was antagonized by nanomolar concentrations of the A3 antagonist MRS 1220, but not by the agonist NECA (up to 300 nM), consistent with labeling of R. CA200645 normally dissociated slowly from the A3AR, but inclusion of xanthine amine congener (XAC) or VUF 5455 during washout markedly accelerated the reduction in the number of particles exhibiting τD3 characteristics. It is notable that this effect was accompanied by a significant increase in the number of particles with τD2 diffusion. These data show that FCS analysis of ligand-occupied receptors provides a unique means of monitoring ligand A3AR residence times that are significantly reduced as a consequence of allosteric interaction across the dimer interface.—Corriden, R., Kilpatrick, L.

Our results demonstrated that NB effectively synergized with Cur to enhance its antiproliferative activity on A375 human melanoma cells by induction of apoptosis, as evidenced by an increase in sub-G1 cell population, DNA fragmentation, PARP cleavage and caspase activation. Further mechanistic studies by Western blotting showed that after treatment of the cells with NB/Cur, up-regulation of the expression level of phosphorylated JNK and down-regulation of the expression level of phosphorylated ERK and Akt contributed to A375 cells apoptosis. Moreover, NB also potentiated Cur to trigger intracellular ROS overproduction and the DNA damage with up-regulation of the expression level of phosphorylated ATM, phosphorylated Brca1 and phosphorylated p53. The results indicate the combinational application potential of NB and Cur in treatments of cancers."
https://openalex.org/W1995792761,"Many essential cellular proteins fold only with the assistance of chaperonin machines like the GroEL-GroES system of Escherichia coli. However, the mechanistic details of assisted protein folding by GroEL-GroES remain the subject of ongoing debate. We previously demonstrated that GroEL-GroES enhances the productive folding of a kinetically trapped substrate protein through unfolding, where both binding energy and the energy of ATP hydrolysis are used to disrupt the inhibitory misfolded states. Here, we show that the intrinsically disordered yet highly conserved C-terminal sequence of the GroEL subunits directly contributes to substrate protein unfolding. Interactions between the C terminus and the non-native substrate protein alter the binding position of the substrate protein on the GroEL apical surface. The C-terminal tails also impact the conformational state of the substrate protein during capture and encapsulation on the GroEL ring. Importantly, removal of the C termini results in slower overall folding, reducing the fraction of the substrate protein that commits quickly to a productive folding pathway and slowing several kinetically distinct folding transitions that occur inside the GroEL-GroES cavity. The conserved C-terminal tails of GroEL are thus important for protein folding from the beginning to the end of the chaperonin reaction cycle."

https://openalex.org/W2027286022,"Special AT-rich sequence-binding protein-1 (SATB1) has been identified as a genome organizer that reprograms chromatin organization and transcription profiles. SATB1 promotes tumor growth and metastasis in breast cancer and is associated with poor prognosis in several cancer types. The association between SATB1 and colorectal cancer (CRC) has not been studied intensively. Therefore, this study aimed to investigate the effect of SATB1 on CRC growth and metastasis in vitro and in vivo and its correlation with overall survival and clinicopathological factors in CRC patients. Stable SATB1 knockdown and SATB1-overexpressing cell lines were established. SATB1 knockdown decreased cell growth, colony formation, migration, and invasion and increased apoptosis in CRC cells in vitro (p<0.05), whereas SATB1 overexpression had the opposite effect. SATB1 overexpression increased tumor growth and metastasis to lung and liver in vivo by using xenograft animal models (p<0.05). Thus, SATB1 promoted an aggressive CRC phenotype in vitro and in vivo. Immunohistochemical analysis of 560 CRC specimens showed that SATB1 expression was significantly higher in CRC tissues than in matched non-tumor mucosa (p<0.001). In addition, SATB1 expression was significantly higher in patients with poorly differentiated tumors, higher invasion depth, distant metastasis, and advanced TNM stage. SATB1-positive patients had a poorer prognosis than SATB1-negative patients, and SATB1 was identified as an independent prognostic factor for CRC (p = 0.009). Strikingly, we also evaluated SATB2 expression in CRC and found that SATB2 was more abundantly expressed in non-cancerous mucosa compared to colorectal cancer tissues (p<0.001). However, SATB2 expression had no influence on prognosis of CRC patients (p = 0.836). SATB1 expression was significantly associated with shorter survival time either in SATB2-positive patients or in SATB2-negative patients (p<0.001). In conclusion, our findings indicated an important role for SATB1 in CRC tumorigenesis and metastasis. Therefore, SATB1 may represent an important prognostic biomarker and therapeutic target for CRC."
https://openalex.org/W2043376513,"The cotton aphid, Aphis gossypii Glover, is a polyphagous pest that inflicts great damage to cotton yields worldwide. Antennal olfaction, which is extremely important for insect survival, mediates key behaviors such as host preference, mate choice, and oviposition site selection. In insects, odor detection is mediated by odorant receptors (ORs) and ionotropic receptors (IRs), which ensure the specificity of the olfactory sensory neuron responses. In this study, our aim is to identify chemosensory receptors in the cotton aphid genome, as a means to uncover olfactory encoding of the polyphagous feeding habits as well as to aid the discovery of new targets for behavioral interference. We identified a total of 45 candidate ORs and 14 IRs in the cotton aphid genome. Among the candidate AgoORs, 9 are apparent pseudogenes, while 19 can be clustered with ORs from the pea aphid, forming 16 AgoOR/ApOR orthologous subgroups. Among the candidate IRs, we identified homologs of the two highly conserved co-receptors IR8a and IR25a; no AgoIR retain the complete glutamic acid binding domain, suggesting that putative AgoIRs bind different ligands. Our results provide the necessary information for functional characterization of the chemosensory receptors of A. gossypii, with potential for new or refined applications of semiochemicals-based control of this pest insect."
https://openalex.org/W2167133383,"This work combined gene and protein expression, gas chromatography-flame ionization detector, and hydrophilic interaction liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry to compare lipid metabolism changes in undifferentiated/proliferating vs. functionally differentiated mammary epithelial cells (MECs) and to study their correlation to breast cancer survival. Sixty-eight genes involved in lipid metabolism were changed in MEC differentiation. Differentiated cells showed induction of Elovl6 (2-fold), Scd1 (4-fold), and Fads2 (2-fold), which correlated with increased levels of C16:1 n–7 and C18:1 n–9 (1.5-fold), C20:3 n–6 (2.5-fold), and C20:4 n–6 (6-fold) fatty acids (FAs) and more phospholipids (PLs) containing these species. Further, increased expression (2- to 3-fold) of genes in phosphatidylethanolamine (PE) de novo biosynthesis resulted in a 20% PE increase. Proliferating/ undifferentiated cells showed higher C16:0 (1.7-fold) and C18:2 n–6 (4.2-fold) levels and more PLs containing C16:0 FAs [PC(16:0/16:1), PG(16:0/18:2), PG(16: 0/18:1), and SM(16:0/18:0)]. Kaplan-Meier analysis of data from 3455 patients with breast cancer disclosed a positive correlation for 59% of genes expressed in differentiated MECs with better survival. PE biosynthesis and FA oxidation correlated with better prognosis in patients with breast cancer, including the basal-like subtype. Therefore, genes involved in mammary gland FA and PL metabolism and their resulting molecular species reflect the cellular proliferative ability and differentiation state and deserve further studies as potential markers of breast cancer progression.— Dória, M.

https://openalex.org/W2152343080,"Up-regulation of placental soluble fms-like tyrosine kinase 1 (sFlt1) contributes to the pathogenesis of preeclampsia. To evaluate novel upstream pathways that regulate placental sFlt1 production, we screened a library of natural compounds (n=502) in human placental cell lines. Here, we report 3 compounds in the cardiac glycoside family, ouabain, gitoxigenin, and digitoxin, that inhibit placental sFlt1 production at nanomolar concentrations in vitro. We further characterized ouabain and demonstrated that it inhibits sFlt1 mRNA and protein expression in human placental cytotrophoblasts and explant cultures in a dose- and time-dependent manner. Ouabain down-regulated sFlt1 production by inhibiting hypoxia-inducible factor 1 (HIF-1α) protein expression in the placenta. Furthermore, we found that phosphorylation of heat-shock protein 27 (HSP27) was necessary for ouabain to inhibit HIF-1α translation. In a rat model of pregnancy-induced hypertension, ouabain reduced mean arterial pressure and enhanced placental HSP27 phosphorylation without any adverse effects on pups. Further studies are needed to explore the usefulness of targeting HIF-1α/HSP27 pathway in preeclampsia."
https://openalex.org/W1970138950,"Neuronal apoptosis is one of the major causes of poststroke neurological deficits. Inflammation during the acute phase of stroke results in nuclear translocation of NFκB in affected cells in the infarct area. Macrophage migration inhibitory factor (MIF) promotes cardiomyocyte survival in mice following heart ischemia. However, the role of MIF during stroke remains limited. In this study, we showed that MIF expression is down-regulated by 0.75 ± 0.10-fold of the control in the infarct area in the mouse brains. Two functional cis-acing NFκB response elements were identified in the human MIF promoter. Dual activation of hypoxia and NFκB signaling resulted in significant reduction of MIF promoter activity to 0.86 ± 0.01-fold of the control. Furthermore, MIF reduced caspase-3 activation and protected neurons from oxidative stress- and in vitro ischemia/reperfusion-induced apoptosis. H2O2 significantly induced cell death with 12.81 ± 0.58-fold increase of TUNEL-positive cells, and overexpression of MIF blocked the H2O2-induced cell death. Disruption of the MIF gene in MIF-knockout mice resulted in caspase-3 activation, neuronal loss, and increased infarct development during stroke in vivo. The infarct volume was increased from 6.51 ± 0.74% in the wild-type mice to 9.07 ± 0.66% in the MIF-knockout mice. Our study demonstrates that MIF exerts a neuronal protective effect and that down-regulation of MIF by NFκB-mediated signaling under hypoxia accelerates neuronal loss during stroke. Our results suggest that MIF is an important molecule for preserving a longer time window for stroke treatment, and strategies to maintain MIF expression at physiological level could have beneficial effects for stroke patients."

In these models, feature selection techniques are used to pre-process the raw data and remove noise. In this paper, a prediction model is constructed to forecast stock market behavior with the aid of independent component analysis, canonical correlation analysis, and a support vector machine. First, two types of features are extracted from the historical closing prices and 39 technical variables obtained by independent component analysis. Second, a canonical correlation analysis method is utilized to combine the two types of features and extract intrinsic features to improve the performance of the prediction model. Finally, a support vector machine is applied to forecast the next day's closing price. The proposed model is applied to the Shanghai stock market index and the Dow Jones index, and experimental results show that the proposed model performs better in the area of prediction than other two similar models."
https://openalex.org/W2156062402,"Bombyx mori (B. mori), silkworm, is one of the most important economic insects in the world, while phoxim, an organophosphorus (OP) pesticide, impact its economic benefits seriously. Phoxim exposure can damage the brain, fatbody, midgut and haemolymph of B. mori. However the metabolism of proteins and carbohydrates in phoxim-exposed B. mori can be improved by Titanium dioxide nanoparticles (TiO2 NPs). In this study, we explored whether TiO2 NPs treatment can reduce the phoxim-induced brain damage of the 5th larval instar of B. mori. We observed that TiO2 NPs pretreatments significantly reduced the mortality of phoxim-exposed larva and relieved severe brain damage and oxidative stress under phoxim exposure in the brain. The treatments also relieved the phoxim-induced increases in the contents of acetylcholine (Ach), glutamate (Glu) and nitric oxide (NO) and the phoxim-induced decreases in the contents of norepinephrine (NE), Dopamine (DA), and 5-hydroxytryptamine (5-HT), and reduced the inhibition of acetylcholinesterase (AChE), Na+/K+-ATPase, Ca2+-ATPase, and Ca2+/Mg2+-ATPase activities and the activation of total nitric oxide synthase (TNOS) in the brain. Furthermore, digital gene expression profile (DGE) analysis and real time quantitative PCR (qRT-PCR) assay revealed that TiO2 NPs pretreatment inhibited the up-regulated expression of ace1, cytochrome c, caspase-9, caspase-3, Bm109 and down-regulated expression of BmIap caused by phoxim; these genes are involved in nerve conduction, oxidative stress and apoptosis. TiO2 NPs pretreatment also inhibited the down-regulated expression of H+ transporting ATP synthase and vacuolar ATP synthase under phoxim exposure, which are involved in ion transport and energy metabolism. These results indicate that TiO2 NPs pretreatment reduced the phoxim-induced nerve toxicity in the brain of B. mori."
https://openalex.org/W2053861334,"Earth harbors an enormous portion of subsurface microbial life, whose microbiome flux across geographical locations remains mainly unexplored due to difficult access to samples. Here, we investigated the microbiome relatedness of subsurface biofilms of two sulfidic springs in southeast Germany that have similar physical and chemical parameters and are fed by one deep groundwater current. Due to their unique hydrogeological setting these springs provide accessible windows to subsurface biofilms dominated by the same uncultivated archaeal species, called SM1 Euryarchaeon. Comparative analysis of infrared imaging spectra demonstrated great variations in archaeal membrane composition between biofilms of the two springs, suggesting different SM1 euryarchaeal strains of the same species at both aquifer outlets. This strain variation was supported by ultrastructural and metagenomic analyses of the archaeal biofilms, which included intergenic spacer region sequencing of the rRNA gene operon. At 16S rRNA gene level, PhyloChip G3 DNA microarray detected similar biofilm communities for archaea, but site-specific communities for bacteria. Both biofilms showed an enrichment of different deltaproteobacterial operational taxonomic units, whose families were, however, congruent as were their lipid spectra. Consequently, the function of the major proportion of the bacteriome appeared to be conserved across the geographic locations studied, which was confirmed by dsrB-directed quantitative PCR. Consequently, microbiome differences of these subsurface biofilms exist at subtle nuances for archaea (strain level variation) and at higher taxonomic levels for predominant bacteria without a substantial perturbation in bacteriome function. The results of this communication provide deep insight into the dynamics of subsurface microbial life and warrant its future investigation with regard to metabolic and genomic analyses."
https://openalex.org/W2122012867,"α-Synuclein is a key pathogenic protein that aggregates in hallmark lesions in Parkinson's disease and other α-synucleinopathies. Prior in vitro studies demonstrated that it is a substrate for cross-linking by transglutaminase 2 (TG2) into higher-order species. Here we investigated whether this increased aggregation occurs in vivo and whether TG2 exacerbates α-synuclein toxicity in Mus musculus and Saccharomyces cerevisiae. Compared with α-synuclein transgenic (SynTg) mice, animals double transgenic for human α-synuclein and TG2 (TG2Tg/SynTg) manifested greater high-molecular-weight insoluble species of α-synuclein in brain lysates and developed α-synuclein aggregates in the synaptic vesicle fraction. In addition, larger proteinase K-resistant aggregates developed, along with increased thioflavin-S-positive amyloid fibrils. This correlated with an exaggerated neuroinflammatory response, as seen with more astrocytes and microglia. Further neuronal damage was suggested by greater morphological disruption of nerve fibers and a trend toward decreased c-Fos immunoreactive neurons. Finally, the performance of TG2Tg/SynTg animals on motor behavioral tasks was worse relative to SynTg mice. Greater toxicity of α-synuclein was also demonstrated in yeast cells coexpressing TG2. Our findings demonstrate that TG2 promotes the aggregation of α-synuclein in vivo and that this is associated with aggravated toxicity of α-synuclein and its downstream neuropathologic consequences.—Grosso, H., Woo, J.-M., Lee, K.W., Im, J.-Y., Masliah, E., Junn, E., Mouradian, M.

https://openalex.org/W2076749962,"Transient starch in leaves is synthesized by various biosynthetic enzymes in the chloroplasts during the light period. This paper presents the first mathematical model for the (bio)synthesis of the chain-length distribution (CLD) of transient starch to aid the understanding of this synthesis. The model expresses the rate of change of the CLD in terms of the actions of the enzymes involved. Using this to simulate the experimental CLD with different enzyme combinations is a new means to test for enzymes that are significant to the rate of change of the CLD during synthesis. Comparison between the simulated CLD from different enzyme combinations and the experimental CLD in the leaves of the model plant Arabidopsis thaliana indicate α-amylase, in addition to the core starch biosynthetic enzymes, is also involved in the modification of glucans for the synthesis of insoluble starch granules. The simulations suggest involvement of β-amylase, in the absence of α-amylase in mutants, slows the rate of attaining a crystalline-competent CLD for crystallization of glucans to form insoluble starch. This suggests a minor role of β-amylase in shaping normal starch synthesis. The model simulation predicts that debranching of glucans is an efficient mechanism for the attainment of crystalline-competent CLD; however, attaining this is still possible, albeit slower, through combinations of α- and β-amylase in the absence of isoamylase-type debranching enzyme. In Arabidopsis defective in one of the isoamylase-type debranching enzymes, the impact of α-amylase in starch synthesis is reduced, while β-amylase becomes significantly involved, slowing the rate of synthesis in this mutant. Modeling of transient starch CLD brings to light previously unrecognized but significant effects of α- and β-amylase on the rate of transient starch synthesis."
https://openalex.org/W2041507295,"Defensins are components of the innate immune system that promote the directional migration and activation of dendritic cells, thereby modulating the adaptive immune response. Because matrix glycosaminoglycan (GAG) is known to be important for these functions, we characterized the structural features of human β-defensin 6 (hBD6) and GAG interaction using a combination of structural and in silico analyses. Our results showed that GAG model compounds, a pentasaccharide (fondaparinux, FX) and an octasaccharide heparin derivative (dp8) bind to the α-helix and in the loops between the β2 and β3 strands, inducing the formation of a ternary complex with a 2:1 hBD6:FX stoichiometry. Competition experiments indicated an overlap of GAG and chemokine receptor CCR2 binding sites. An NMR-derived model of the ternary complex revealed that FX interacts with hBD6 along the dimerization interface, primarily contacting the α-helices and β2-β3 loops from each monomer. We further demonstrated that high-pressure NMR spectroscopy could capture an intermediate stage of hBD6-FX interaction, exhibiting features of a cooperative binding mechanism. Collectively, these data suggest a “sandwich-like” model in which two hBD6 molecules bind a single FX chain and provide novel structural insights into how defensin orchestrates leukocyte recruitment through GAG binding and G protein-coupled receptor activation.

This work adds significant information to the currently limited data available for the molecular structures and dynamics of defensin carbohydrate binding. Human defensins have been described as a group of structurally diverse, multifunctional host proteins that are secreted in response to danger and are able to both recruit and activate various leukocytes, particularly antigen-presenting cells, including dendritic cells. These proteins, also called alarmins, act as warning signals that alert the innate and adaptive immune systems (1.Oppenheim J.J. Yang D. Alarmins: chemotactic activators of immune responses.Curr.

The structure and function of defensins are very similar to those of chemokines, a superfamily of some 50 (8- to 12-kDa) proteins that are involved in leukocyte trafficking and activation (3.Yang D.

It has been thought that, within tissues, concentration gradients of chemokines are formed and maintained to establish directional signals for migrating cells, and this process is believed to be controlled by intermolecular complexes with GAGs (8.Blanchet X.

GAGs such as heparin and heparan sulfate (HS) are long, linear, sulfated polysaccharides. Heparin, which resembles certain sequences found in HS, is used widely therapeutically and is readily available in large quantities. Therefore, it is often used as a model for the investigation of GAG interactions. Heparin and HS are composed of disaccharide-repeating units of alternating glucosamine and uronic acid. The diversity stems from differences in the level of epimerization and positions of N- and O-sulfate groups along the chain (10.Prabhakar V. Capila I. Sasisekharan R. The structural elucidation of glycosaminoglycans.Methods Mol. Biol. 2009; 534: 147-156PubMed Google Scholar).

Here we investigate the structural features of the defensin-GAG complex using two GAG models: the heparin pentasaccharide (fondaparinux, FX) and an octasaccharide heparin derivative (dp8). We mapped the interaction of hBD6 with FX and characterized their binding using a combination of NMR spectroscopy, high pressure, relaxation parameters, computational analysis, and isothermal titration calorimetry (ITC)-based methods. Our results reveal that FX binds along the N-terminal helices and to the loops between the β2 and β3 strands of hBD6, promoting the formation of a ternary complex. Additionally, binding studies with a CCR2 N-terminal sulfopeptide demonstrate overlap and competition with the FX binding interface. This NMR study describes the structural and dynamic characterization of hBD6-GAG recognition, which, we suggest, may be involved in the regulation of defensin signaling. 15N-Labeled hBD6 was expressed and purified as described previously (24.De Paula V.S.

Fondaparinux was purchased from GlaxoSmithKline. The heparin-derived octasaccharide (degree of polymerization, dp8) was prepared by size exclusion chromatography (SEC) of a commercially available enoxaparin sample applied to a Bio-gel P10 column as described elsewhere (25.Pomin V.H.

In titration experiments, heparin-derived oligosaccharides (3.7 mm) were added progressively to an hBD6 sample (0.1 mm) in the abovementioned buffer. For titration of FX into hBD6, the following molar ratios of GAG to defensin were used: 0.1:1, 0.2:1, 0.3:1, 0.5:1, 1:1, 2:1, 3:1, and 4:1. Titrations of dp8 into hBD6 were carried out with the following ratios: 0.25:1, 0.5:1, and 1:1. The pH value at each step of the titration was kept constant. Chemical shift perturbations were calculated using CcpNmr analysis (26.Vranken W.F. Boucher W. Stevens T.J. Fogh R.H. Pajon A. Llinas M. Ulrich E.L. Markley J.L. Ionides J. Laue E.D.

The synthetic sulfopeptide (purity >95%) corresponding to the N-terminal of chemokine receptor CCR2 was purchased from American Peptide. The peptide has the following sequence: CCR2(sulfated)-18EEVTTFFDsYDsYGAP31. Binding site competition between the CCR2 sulfopeptide and FX was assessed using 1H,15N HSQC experiments at 25 °C. Titrations of 1 mm FX into a mixture of 400 μm CCR2 sulfopeptide, 100 μm 15N-labeled hBD6, 10 mm phosphate buffer (pH 5.0), and 10% (v/v) D2O were monitored by measuring the chemical shift changes in two-dimensional 1H,15N HSQC. Relaxation experiments were recorded on 100 μm 15N-labeled hBD6 at a field of 800 MHz. 15N R1 and R2 relaxation rates were measured from spectra with different relaxation delays: 20, 50, 100 (duplicate), 200, 250, 500, 750, and 1000 ms for R1 and 48, 80 (duplicate), 112, 144, 176, 208, 240, 272, and 304 ms for R2.

Size exclusion chromatography was carried out using a Superdex peptide 10/300 GL column (GE Healthcare) attached to an AKTA prime HPLC system, with detection conducted at 214 nm. The samples were run at 0.5 ml/min in 20 mm sodium phosphate (pH 5.0 and 7.4). ITC experiments were performed at 25 °C with an iTC200 microcalorimeter (GE Healthcare). hBD6 and fondaparinux were dissolved in 20 mm sodium phosphate buffer, 50 mm NaCl (pH 5.0). The sample cell was filled with 100 μm hBD6 and the injection syringe with 1500 μm FX. The titration typically consisted of a preliminary injection followed by ∼15 subsequent injections with 150-s spacing. The heat of dilution of the FX and the heat of dilution of the buffer were small compared with the heat of binding and were subtracted from the experimental titration results. The experimental data were integrated and fitted to a theoretical single binding site titration curve using Origin 7 software. Molecular docking of FX with hBD6 was carried out using HADDOCK 2.1 (28.de Vries S.J. van Dijk M. Bonvin A.M. The HADDOCK web server for data-driven biomolecular docking.Nat. Protoc. 2010; 5: 883-897Crossref PubMed Scopus (969) Google Scholar). Because the C-terminal tail does not participate in the binding and to reduce the complexity of the calculation, only residues 1–38 from the 2LWL PDB structure (24.De Paula V.S. Gomes N.S. Lima L.G. Miyamoto C.A. Monteiro R.Q. Almeida F.C. Valente A.P. Structural basis for the interaction of human β-defensin 6 and its putative chemokine receptor CCR2 and breast cancer microvesicles.J. Mol. Biol. 2013; 425: 4479-4495Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar) were included in the calculations. The pentasaccharide coordinates used as input for HADDOCK was obtained in drugbank.ca. Topology and parameter files for FX were obtained from the PRODRG program (29.Schüttelkopf W. van Aalten D.M.F. PRODRG: a tool for high-throughput crystallography of protein-ligand complexes.Acta Crystallogr. D Biol. Crystallogr. 2004; 60: 1355-1363Crossref PubMed Scopus (4253) Google Scholar), and necessary modifications were made in the parameter file and included in the HADDOCK 2.1 program suite. The docking of pentasaccharide onto hBD6 was driven by ambiguous interactions restraints. For hBD6, on the basis of the chemical shift perturbation data, residues 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 27, 30, and 31 were defined as active in HADDOCK, with residues 5, 7, 29, and 32 defined as passive. For pentasaccharide, the sulfate groups were defined as active, with the remaining of the structure as passive. The interface information was converted into ambiguous interactions restraints via the setup page of the HADDOCK web site. The generated ambiguous interactions restraint files, together with one FX molecule and two hBD6 molecules, were then supplied to the multibody server as input for the docking (30.Karaca E. Melquiond A.S. de Vries S.J. Kastritis P.L. Bonvin A.M. Building macromolecular assemblies by information-driven docking: introducing the HADDOCK multibody docking server.Mol. Cell Proteomics. 2010; 9: 1784-1794Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar). To favor compactness of the solution, center of mass restraints were enabled. The number of structures was increased to 5000, 400, and 400 for it0, it1, and water, respectively. All other parameters were left at their default settings. Complex structures were sorted according to the intermolecular interaction energy (the sum of intermolecular van der Waals and electrostatic energies and restraint energies). The calculated models were clustered using a 5.0-Å interface root mean square deviation cutoff. High-pressure experiments were conducted using a zirconium high-pressure cell system (Daedalus Innovations LLC) at 25 °C with a Bruker Avance III 800-MHz spectrometer. Both the line and pressure generator were filled with extra low viscosity paraffin wax (Sigma-Aldrich, catalog no. 95369). High-pressure spectra of two samples of 15N-labeled hBD6 (0.1 mm) were measured as a series of 1H,15N HSQC spectra. One sample was measured in the free state and one sample with addition of FX (0.1 mm) in 10 mm sodium phosphate buffer (pH 5.0). HSQC spectra were recorded at 1, 10, 75, 100, 250, 500, 750, 1000, 1700, 2000, and 2400 bar. 15N relaxation measurements (T1, T2, and {1H}15N NOE) for the free state of hBD6 and in complex with FX were recorded at 2400 bar and at 800 MHz. The changes of the 1H chemical shifts with pressure (δHN) were fitted to a polynomial quadratic function: δHN(p) = δ0(p0) + B1(p − p0) + B2(p − p0)2, where B1 (ppm/bar) and B2 (ppm/bar2) are the linear (first-order) and non-linear (second-order) coefficients, respectively (31.Kitahara R.

Spectrosc. 2013; 71: 35-58Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). Although a phosphate buffer system is not recommended for high-pressure experiments, we decide to use it because our initial characterization was done with this buffer (31.Kitahara R. Hata K. Li H. Williamson M.P. Akasaka K. Pressure-induced chemical shifts as probes for conformational fluctuations in proteins.Prog. Nucl. Magn. Reson. Spectrosc. 2013; 71: 35-58Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). As a control, we performed a 1H,15N HSQC at pH 4.0, and the changes in 1H15N chemical shifts were much smaller than those observed by the pressure effects. Therefore, we believe that the effects of changes in pH in the hBD6 are limited. We used NMR spectroscopy to map the direct interaction between hBD6 and GAG and to obtain high-resolution mapping of the binding interface of their complexes. The observed NMR chemical shift changes may result from direct interaction with the binding partner or from binding-induced conformational changes. We used the synthetic heparin pentasaccharide (48.Hricovíni M. Torri G. Dynamics in aqueous solutions of the pentasaccharide corresponding to the binding site of heparin for antithrombin III studied by NMR relaxation measurements.Carbohydr. Res. 1995; 268: 159-175Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar) FX as a highly sulfated HS mimetic and monitored its binding to hBD6 using two-dimensional 1H,15N HSQC NMR spectroscopy. The residues that exhibited large changes in chemical shift were correlated with significant involvement in FX binding. The 1H,15N HSQC spectrum of free 15N-labeled hBD6 assigned previously (24.De Paula V.S. Gomes N.S. Lima L.G. Miyamoto C.A. Monteiro R.Q. Almeida F.C. Valente A.P. Structural basis for the interaction of human β-defensin 6 and its putative chemokine receptor CCR2 and breast cancer microvesicles.J. Mol. Biol. 2013; 425: 4479-4495Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar) was used to monitor chemical shift changes of amide resonances upon binding to FX. Fig. 1A shows a detailed region of the 1H,15N HSQC NMR spectra for hBD6 recorded as a function of the FX concentration, ranging from a 0 (black) to a 4:1 FX:hBD6 ratio (cyan). Moreover, NMR titration experiments revealed large changes in hBD6 chemical shift in fast exchange equilibrium between free and FX-bound hBD6, as demonstrated by a gradual shift in peak positions in 1H,15N HSQC. We did not observe any changes such as precipitation or signal disappearance upon FX addition. A quantitative analysis of the 1H and 15N chemical shift changes for a subset of hBD6 resonances following titration with FX using a simple binding model yielded a Kd of 4.1 (± 2.9) μm (Fig. 1B). Interestingly, both hBD2 and chemokines can interact with a heparin mimetic with similar micromolar affinities (22.Seo E.S. Blaum B.S. Vargues T. De Cecco M. Deakin J.A. Lyon M. Barran P.E. Campopiano D.J. Uhrín D. Interaction of human β-defensin 2 (HBD2) with glycosaminoglycans.Biochemistry. 2010; 49: 10486-10495Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar, 32.Poluri K.M. Joseph P.R.

Chem. 2013; 288: 25143-25153Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). Fig. 1C shows the CSP map of hBD6 upon complete saturation (FX:hBD6 molar ratio of 4:1) plotted as a function of the residue number of hBD6 for the FX titration. It is clear that the hBD6 residues most sensitive to FX binding are located in the α-helix (Phe-1, Phe-2, Asp-3, Glu-4, Lys-5, Cys-6, and Asn-7) and the loops between the β2 and β3 strands (Cys-27, Gln-28, Lys-29, Ser-30, Leu-31, and Lys-32). Three of seven lysines (Lys-5, Lys-29, and Lys-32) had backbone NH (15N and 1H) resonances affected significantly by the binding of FX (Fig. 1). The perturbed residues indicate that Coulombic interactions contribute to FX binding. Fig. 1D shows the FX binding site mapped onto the hBD6 structure (PDB code 2LWL). Our data indicate that Lys-5 is located near Lys-32. This result suggests that, together, Lys-5, Lys-29, and Lys-32 make up the common heparin-binding site BBXB motif, which is usually observed in the heparin-binding proteins. B and X stand for basic and neutral amino acids, respectively (12.Lortat-Jacob H. The molecular basis and functional implications of chemokine interactions with heparan sulfate.Curr. Opin. Struct. Biol. 2009; 19: 543-548Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). The binding of hBD6 to FX was investigated using ITC to obtain a clearer picture of the binding stoichiometry and binding mechanism. The raw ITC data showed that the binding of FX to hBD6 is exothermic, resulting in negative peaks in the plots of power versus time. The integrated heat values were fitted with a one-site binding model to obtain a binding stoichiometry of n = 0.5 ± 0.03 and an equilibrium Kd of 10.4 ± 2.7 μm. The stoichiometry and equilibrium dissociation constant are both in agreement with the results derived from the NMR data and are consistent with a 2:1 hBD6:FX stoichiometry (Fig. 2). We also monitored the binding of a heparin-derived octasaccharide (dp8) using two-dimensional 1H,15N HSQC NMR experiments. Residues that exhibited the largest changes in CSP correlated with the residues with large CSP changes observed for FX (Fig. 3). Saturation of the binding site was reached at a 2:1 hBD6:dp8 ratio, after which a further chemical shift change was negligible for all residues. CSP showed major chemical shift changes for the NH signals of residues Phe-1, Phe-2, Asp-3, Glu-4, Asn-7, Cys-27, Gln-28, Lys-29, Ser-30, and Leu-31. We used backbone dynamics to further characterize hBD6-FX recognition. We examined the picosecond-nanosecond and microsecond-millisecond time scale conformational dynamics of the free hBD6 and the FX-bound form using 15N relaxation parameter measurements. Fig. 4 shows the 15N R1 and R2 relaxation rates and R2/R1 values for hBD6 and the hBD6-FX complex at a 1:1 molar ratio. Remarkably, both R2 and R2/R1 showed that the region exhibiting extensive microsecond-millisecond conformational exchange, in both the free and bound states of hBD6, encompasses part of the binding site for GAG formed by residues from the α-helix. Interestingly, residues Lys-29, Ser-30, and Lys-32 showed increased R2 values in the presence of FX when compared with hBD6 free in solution, indicating that the binding interface becomes dynamic at a microsecond-millisecond time scale in the hBD6-GAG complex (Fig. 4B and C). These data demonstrate that Ser-30, together with Lys-5, Lys-29, and Lys-32, is likely to contribute to the development of the BBXB motif observed in heparin-binding proteins. Another interesting feature of this defensin is that the picosecond-nanosecond dynamics observed in the first residues located in the α-helix in the free state were reduced in the FX-bound form, indicating that the α-helix becomes more structured upon FX binding (Fig. 4, B and C). The formation of the hBD6-FX complex was confirmed independently by the overall decrease in 15N R1 associated with an increase in 15N R2, indicating an increase in the overall tumbling time of the protein. The rotational correlation time (τc) for the complex was 7.4 ns, whereas that for the free protein was 3.4 ns, suggesting the formation of a ternar"

Metabolites of noradrenaline and dopamine, 3-methoxy-4-hydroxyphenylglycol (MHPG) and homovanillic acid (HVA), respectively, are reduced by treatment with antipsychotics, but whether these phenomena are caused by antipsychotics or by the pathophysiology of BDI is not known. Interactions between brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) and mood disorders have also been suggested. We conducted a multifaceted study in BDI patients to ascertain if biological markers are associated with the manic state. Patients with Young Mania Rating Scale (YMRS) scores >20 participated in the study. Final analyses involved 24 BDI patients (13 men and 11 women). We used YMRS scores to identify mania stages in individual BDI patients (i.e., manic syndrome, response and remission stages). Statistical analyses were done using one-way repeated-measures analyses of variance (rep-ANOVA) throughout manic syndrome, response and remission stages. Plasma concentrations of MHPG and HVA were analyzed by high-performance liquid chromatography with electrochemical detection. Plasma levels of BDNF were measured by sandwich enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. BDI patients had significantly reduced plasma levels of MHPG throughout manic syndrome, response and remission stages (rep-ANOVA, p = 0.002). Without a case of response state, there was a significant positive correlation between YMRS scores and plasma levels of MHPG (ρ = 0.33, p = 0.033, n = 48). Plasma levels of HVA and BDNF were not significantly altered throughout manic syndrome, response and remission stages. These data suggest that the peripheral level of MHPG (which is associated with noradrenaline levels in the brain) could be used as a biomarker for the manic state in BDI. The MHPG level is likely to reflect the clinical characteristics of the manic syndrome in BDI, and noradrenaline may reflect the pathophysiology from manic to remission states."
https://openalex.org/W2043129552,"Virus-associated RNA I (VA RNAI) is a short (∼160-nucleotide) non-coding RNA transcript employed by adenoviruses to subvert the innate immune system protein double-stranded RNA-activated protein kinase (PKR). The central domain of VA RNAI is proposed to contain a complex tertiary structure that contributes to its optimal inhibitory activity against PKR. Here we use a combination of VA RNAI mutagenesis, structural analyses, as well as PKR activity and binding assays to dissect this tertiary structure and assess its functional role. Our results support the existence of a pH- and Mg(2+)-dependent tertiary structure involving pseudoknot formation within the central domain. Unexpectedly, this structure appears to play no direct role in PKR inhibition. Deletion of central domain sequences within a minimal but fully active construct lacking the tertiary structure reveals a crucial role in PKR binding and inhibition for nucleotides in the 5' half of the central domain. Deletion of the central domain 3' half also significantly impacts activity but appears to arise indirectly by reducing its capacity to assist in optimally presenting the 5' half sequence. Collectively, our results identify regions of VA RNAI critical for PKR inhibition and reveal that the requirements for an effective RNA inhibitor of PKR are simpler than appreciated previously."
https://openalex.org/W2051681035,"Many bioscience fields employ high-throughput methods to screen multiple biochemical conditions. The analysis of these becomes tedious without a degree of automation. Crystallization, a rate limiting step in biological X-ray crystallography, is one of these fields. Screening of multiple potential crystallization conditions (cocktails) is the most effective method of probing a proteins phase diagram and guiding crystallization but the interpretation of results can be time-consuming. To aid this empirical approach a cocktail distance coefficient was developed to quantitatively compare macromolecule crystallization conditions and outcome. These coefficients were evaluated against an existing similarity metric developed for crystallization, the C6 metric, using both virtual crystallization screens and by comparison of two related 1,536-cocktail high-throughput crystallization screens. Hierarchical clustering was employed to visualize one of these screens and the crystallization results from an exopolyphosphatase-related protein from Bacteroides fragilis, (BfR192) overlaid on this clustering. This demonstrated a strong correlation between certain chemically related clusters and crystal lead conditions. While this analysis was not used to guide the initial crystallization optimization, it led to the re-evaluation of unexplained peaks in the electron density map of the protein and to the insertion and correct placement of sodium, potassium and phosphate atoms in the structure. With these in place, the resulting structure of the putative active site demonstrated features consistent with active sites of other phosphatases which are involved in binding the phosphoryl moieties of nucleotide triphosphates. The new distance coefficient, CDcoeff, appears to be robust in this application, and coupled with hierarchical clustering and the overlay of crystallization outcome, reveals information of biological relevance. While tested with a single example the potential applications related to crystallography appear promising and the distance coefficient, clustering, and hierarchal visualization of results undoubtedly have applications in wider fields."

The cap domain of Rv0805, an MPE from Mycobacterium tuberculosis, is located C-terminal to its catalytic domain and is dispensable for the catalytic activity of this enzyme in vitro. We show here that this C-terminal extension (CTE) mediates in vivo localization of the protein to the cell membrane and cell wall as well as modulates expression levels of Rv0805 in mycobacteria.

Using a panel of mutant proteins, we identify interactions between active site residues of Rv0805 and the CTE that determine its association with the cell wall. Finally, we show that Rv0805 and a truncated mutant devoid of the CTE produce different phenotypic effects when expressed in mycobacteria.

Participants viewed neutral, positive and negative pictures, and took a recognition memory test 5 minutes, 24 hours, or 1 week after learning. The findings are: 1) For neutral, positive and negative pictures, overall recognition accuracy in the 5-min delay did not significantly differ from that in the 24-h delay. For neutral and positive pictures, overall recognition accuracy in the 1-week delay was lower than in the 24-h delay; for negative pictures, overall recognition in the 24-h and 1-week delay did not significantly differ. Therefore negative emotion modulates the effect of time delay on recognition memory, maintaining retention of overall recognition accuracy only within a certain frame of time. 2) For the three types of pictures, recollection and familiarity in the 5-min delay did not significantly differ from that in the 24-h and the 1-week delay. Thus emotion does not appear to modulate the effect of time delay on recollection and familiarity. However, recollection in the 24-h delay was higher than in the 1-week delay, whereas familiarity in the 24-h delay was lower than in the 1-week delay."
https://openalex.org/W2000896465,"The maximum power principle dictates that open biological systems tend to self-organize to a level of efficiency that allows maximal power production. Applying this principle to cellular energetics and whole-body physiology would suggest that for every metabolic challenge, an optimal efficiency exists that maximizes power production. On exposure to hypoxia, it would be favorable if metabolic efficiency would rapidly adjust so as to better preserve work performance. We tested this idea in humans by measuring metabolic efficiency and exercise tolerance under normoxic (FiO2=20.9%) and hypoxic (FiO2=16%) conditions, where FiO2 is fraction of inhaled oxygen. The results were compared with respirometric analyses of skeletal muscle mitochondria from the same individuals. We found that among healthy trained subjects (n=14) with a wide range of metabolic efficiency (ME), those with a high ME during normoxic exercise were able to better maintain exercise capacity (Wmax) in hypoxia. On hypoxic exposure, these subjects acutely decreased their efficiency from 19.2 to 17.4%, thereby likely shifting it closer to a degree of efficiency where maximal power production is achieved. In addition, mitochondria from these subjects had a lower intrinsic respiration compared to subjects that showed a large drop in Wmax in hypoxia An acute shift in efficiency was also demonstrated in isolated mitochondria exposed to physiological levels of hypoxia as P/O ratio increased from 0.9 to 1.3 with hypoxic exposure. These findings suggest the existence of a physiological adaptive response by which metabolic efficiency is dynamically optimized to maximize power production.—Schiffer, T.

The main function of B cells is to produce antibodies to fight against the invaded pathogens and foreign antigens to maintain the homeostasis of the body. On the other hand, skewed functional status of B cells may undermine body functions or injure the organs and tissue, such as the production of auto antibodies against islet cells to cause diabetes (1.Culina S.

However, the conditions of induction of tolerogenic B cells remain to be further investigated. The integrin family has several immune regulatory members, such as αvβ6 (7.Liu T. Liang X. Li T.L. Ma J.

The CX3CR1-expressing cells may be chemotracted to the direction of the endothelial/epithelial region to capture the released αvβ6 or αvβ6-laden exosomes (10.Chen X. Song C.H. Feng B.S. Li T.L. Li P.

Leukoc. Biol. 2011; 90: 751-759Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). In the preliminary study, we observed that human vascular endothelial cells express both CX3CL1 and αvβ6. Based on the above information, we hypothesize that a fraction of CX3CR1-expressing B cells may capture the endothelial cell-released αvβ6 to differentiate into tolerogenic B cells. Thus, we collected human peripheral B cells to be analyzed by flow cytometry. The results showed that a fraction of B cells were both CX3CR1+ and αvβ6+. This fraction of B cells showed immune regulatory properties. Antibodies of β6 (C-19), CX3CR1 (H-70), CX3CL1 (H-300), LAMP1 (C-20), LAP (T-17), TGF-β1 (d-12), and shRNA kits of CX3CL1 and β6 were purchased from Santa Cruz Biotechnology (Beijing, China). Fluorescence-labeled antibodies for flow cytometry were purchased from BD Bioscience. The ELISA kit of TGF-β was purchased from R&D Systems (Beijing, China). The reagents of real time RT-PCR were purchased from Invitrogen. Ten patients (10 male and 10 female; age was 25–58 years old, with an average of 33.4 years old) with egg sensitization, and 10 healthy subjects were recruited into the present study. The using human tissue in the research was approved by the Research Ethic Committee at China PLA General Hospital. An informed written consent was obtained from each human subject. Blood samples were collected from the human subjects (20 ml/person). The peripheral blood mononuclear cells were isolated by gradient density centrifugation and cultured in RPMI1640 medium complemented with 10% fetal cowl serum, 2 mm l-glutamin, 1 mg/ml streptomycin, and 200 units/ml penicillin. The cells were used in further experiments. The immune cells were isolated from peripheral blood mononuclear cells by magnetic cell sorting with commercial reagent kits following the manufacturer's instructions. The isolated immune cells were checked the purity (more than 95%) by flow cytometry before using in further experiments. Human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVEC) 2The abbreviations used are: HUVEChuman umbilical vein endothelial cell(s)FAfood allergy. were cultured in the HUVEC-specific culture medium. To purify the exosomes, the culture supernatant was collected and processed following published procedures (14.Luketic L. Delanghe J. Sobol P.T. Yang P. Frotten E. Mossman K.L. Gauldie J. Bramson J. Wan Y. Antigen presentation by exosomes released from peptide-pulsed dendritic cells is not suppressed by the presence of active CTL.J. Immunol. 2007; 179: 5024-5032Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar). Briefly, the supernatant was subjected to three successive centrifugation steps at 12,000 × g for 1 h, 35,000 × g for 1 h, and 70,000 × g for 3 h at 4 °C. The supernatant was filtered sequentially through 10.0-, 0.45-, and 0.22-μm filters. The supernatant was then ultracentrifuged at 100,000 × g for 1 h at 4 °C. The pellet of exosomes was used for further experiments. The purified exosomes were lysed with lysing buffer; the proteins were analyzed by Western blotting to assess the levels of αvβ6 and the endosome marker LAMP1. human umbilical vein endothelial cell(s) food allergy. For analysis by flow cytometry, brefildin A (10 μg/ml) was added to the culture medium for the last 3 h of culture. Cells were fixed with 2% paraformaldehyde (in case of the intracellular staining, 0.1% Triton X-100 was added to the fixatives) for 1 h. After washing, the cells were blocked by 5% skim milk. The cells were incubated with fluorescence-labeled antibodies as indicated in figures at concentrations of 0.5–1 μg/ml for 1 h at room temperature. The cells were analyzed by a flow cytometer (FACSCanto II; BD Bioscience). The gating was performed when necessary. Briefly, cells were stained with the indicated fluorescence-labeled antibodies. One positively stained cell population was gated first; by double clicking the gated cell population, a new window popped out for further analysis, and so on. CX3CR1+ B cells and CD4+ CD25− T cells (labeled with carboxyfluorescein diacetate, succinimidyl ester) were obtained from healthy subjects. The cells were cultured at a ratio of 1:5 (B cell:T cell) for 3 days (the treatment is denoted in Fig. 5). The cells were collected and analyzed by the carboxyfluorescein diacetate, succinimidyl ester dilution assay. The viability of the cells was checked by trypan blue exclusion assay before each experiment, which was more than 95%. HUVEC were purchased from ATCC and cultured with the HUVEC culture medium (Sigma-Aldrich). The total RNA was extracted using TRIzol reagents. The cDNA was synthesized using a reverse transcription kit. The quantitative PCR was performed on a MiniOpticon real time PCR device using the SYBR Green Master Mix. The results were calculated with the 2−ΔΔCt method. The primers using in this study include integrin β6 (forward, gaaggggtgactgctactgt; reverse, tgcacacacattcaccacag) and β-actin (forward, cgcaaagacctgtatgccaa; reverse, cacacagagtacttgcgctc). The total proteins were extracted from cells. An equal volume (50 μg/well) of the proteins was added to each well, fractioned by SDS-PAGE, and transferred onto a nitrocellulose membrane. The membrane was blocked by 1% BSA for 1 h and incubated with the primary antibodies (0.5–1 μg/ml) overnight at 4 °C, followed by incubation with the second antibodies (conjugated with horseradish peroxidase) for 1 h at room temperature. The immune complex on the membrane was developed by ECL. The results were recorded with x films. The data were presented as means ± S.D. The differences between the two groups were analyzed by analysis of variance, and the means were compared by Student-Newman-Keuls test. p < 0.05 was set as a significant criterion. Published data indicate that the CX3CR1+ B cells are involved in immune regulation (15.Corcione A. Ferretti E. Bertolotto M. Fais F. Raffaghello L. Gregorio A. Tenca C. Ottonello L. Gambini C. Furtado G. Lira S. Pistoia V. CX3CR1 is expressed by human B lymphocytes and meditates CX3CL1 driven chemotaxis of tonsil centrocytes.PLoS One. 2009; 4: e8485Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar); whether their amounts or functions are affected in immune diseases, such as in food allergy (FA), is unclear. In this study, we collected the peripheral blood samples from 20 FA patients (10 male, 10 female; age, 34.5 ± 5.5 years) sensitized to egg, and 20 healthy subjects (10 male, 10 female; age, 35.6 ± 5.8 years). The cell samples were analyzed by flow cytometry. The results showed that CX3CR1+ B cells were detected in the peripheral blood samples of healthy subjects (Fig. 1, A and C), which were significantly less in FA patients (Fig. 1, B and C). Integrin αvβ6 and TGF-β are immune regulatory molecules (16.Saban D.R. Bock F. Chauhan S.K. Masli S. Dana R. Thrombospondin-1 derived from APCs regulates their capacity for allosensitization.J. Immunol. 2010; 185: 4691-4697Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). To elucidate whether the CX3CR1+ B cells contained αvβ6 and TGF-β, using the gating technique, we further analyzed the αvβ6+ and TGF-β+ cells in the gated CX3CR1+ CD19+ B cells and CX3CR1− CD19+ B cells of Fig. 1 (A and B). The results showed that ∼60% CX3CR1+ CD19+ B cells were αvβ6+ and TGF-β+ in both healthy subjects and FA patients (Fig. 1, D–G). We also measured the levels of αvβ6 and TGF-β in CX3CR1− CD19+ B cells; the results showed significantly less αvβ6 and TGF-β were detected in CX3CR1− CD19+ B cells (Fig. 1, D–G). Compared with the LPS-treated B cells, CX3CR1+ B cells expressed much lower levels of CD80 and CD86 (Fig. 1, H–L). Because the αvβ6 is usually expressed by epithelial cells, we wondered whether the detected αvβ6 in the B cells was originally expressed by the B cells. Thus, we isolated CX3CR1+ B cells from the peripheral blood mononuclear cells of healthy subjects. The cells were analyzed by quantitative RT-PCR and Western blotting. The results showed that although the αvβ6 was detected in the CX3CR1+ B cells, the levels of αvβ6 mRNA were below the detectable levels (Fig. 2). The results implicate that the αvβ6 in CX3CR1+ B cells may be captured from extrinsic sources. Previous data indicate that αvβ6 can be released to the microenvironment from epithelial cells via the exosome system (10.Chen X. Song C.H. Feng B.S. Li T.L. Li P. Zheng P.Y. Chen X.M. Xing Z. Yang P.C. Intestinal epithelial cell-derived integrin aβ6 plays an important role in the induction of regulatory T cells and inhibits an antigen-specific Th2 response.J. Leukoc. Biol. 2011; 90: 751-759Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). The αvβ6 in the B cells may be absorbed from the blood stream. To test the inference, we measured the levels of αvβ6 in the sera from healthy subjects and FA patients. However, the levels of αvβ6 in the sera were below the detectable levels (data not shown). Then we took an alternative approach. Based on the fact of the HUVEC express αvβ6 (Fig. 2), we purified exosomes from the culture supernatant of HUVEC; the extracts of exosomes were analyzed by Western blotting. The results showed that CX3CL1 (the ligand of CX3CR1; Fig. 3A), αvβ6 (Fig. 3B), and LAMP1 (a marker of exosomes; Fig. 3C) were detected in the cellular extracts, indicating that the endothelial cell-derived exosomes carry CX3CL1 and αvβ6. We further cultured HUVEC in the inserts of Transwells and BC-3 cells in the basal chambers. Twenty-four hours later, the cells were analyzed by flow cytometry. The results showed 61.1% BC-3 cells containing αvβ6+ (Fig. 3D), indicating that these cells captured αvβ6 in the culture. To clarify whether the detected αvβ6 was attaching to the surface of the cells, some BC-3 cells were processed via the surface staining approach, which resulted in only 1.25% αvβ6+ BC-3 cells (Fig. 3E). Because CX3CL1 was detected in the HUVEC-derived exosomes (Fig. 3A) and CX3CR1+ BC-3 cells captured the exosomes (Fig. 3D), we inferred that the interaction of CX3CL1/CX3CR1 was required in the capturing of the αvβ6-containing exosomes. BC-3 cells were cultured with CX3CL1-null HUVEC in the Transwell system with similar procedures above. Indeed, the αvβ6 capturing by BC-3 cells was abolished (Fig. 3, F–H). Based on the data of Fig. 1 indicating that CX3CR1+ B cells are TGF-β+ but the CX3CR1− B cells are not, we inferred that the endocytic αvβ6 activated the latent TGF-β (LTGF-β) in B cells. To this end, we treated CX3CR1− B cells with anti-IgM. Indeed, the levels of LTGF-β in the B cells increased in an anti-IgM dose-dependent manner (Fig. 4A), but the TGF-β was still below the detectable levels (Fig. 4B). Considering that the HUVEC-derived exosomes contain αvβ6 (Fig. 3B), which can convert LTGF-β to TGF-β, we carried out this experiment again in Transwells where HUVEC or αvβ6-null HUVEC were cultured in the inserts and B cells were cultured in the basal chambers. The results showed that TGF-β was increased in the presence of αvβ6-sufficient HUVEC, but not in the presence of αvβ6-null HUVEC (Fig. 4C). The results indicate that HUVEC-derived αvβ6 converts LTGF-β to TGF-β in B cells. Published data indicate that TGF-β plays a critical role in the differentiation of Tregs (10.Chen X. Song C.H. Feng B.S. Li T.L. Li P. Zheng P.Y. Chen X.M. Xing Z. Yang P.C. Intestinal epithelial cell-derived integrin aβ6 plays an important role in the induction of regulatory T cells and inhibits an antigen-specific Th2 response.J. Leukoc. Biol. 2011; 90: 751-759Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). Because CX3CR1+ B cells express TGF-β, these cells may have immune regulatory ability. Thus, we cultured healthy human CX3CR1+ B cells with CD4+ CD25− T cells (Fig. 4). Using the proliferation as a reference of activation of T cells, we observed that 5.71% T cells proliferated in culturing with medium alone (Fig. 5, A and H); exposure to anti-CD3/CD28 induced 42.4% proliferated T cells (Fig. 5, B and H), which was significantly suppressed in the presence of CX3CR1+ B cells (Fig. 5, C and H) but could not be suppressed by the presence of CX3CR1− B cells (Fig. 5D, H). After priming with HUVEC-derived exosomes, BC-3 cells could suppress T cell proliferation (Fig. 5, E and H), the latter was not suppressed by those BC-3 cells primed by αvβ6-null exosomes (Fig. 5, F–H). The data indicate that human CX3CR1+ B cells have immune suppressor properties. The present study has revealed a subfraction of B cells, the CX3CR1+ B cells, in the human peripheral blood system. Such a fraction of B cells contains αvβ6 and TGF-β, expresses less costimulatory molecules, and has immune suppressor properties. FA patients have a low frequency of CX3CR1+ B cells in the peripheral blood system. Several integrins are involved in immune regulation. αvβ6 can convert the LTGF-β to the active form of TGF-β (17.Giacomini M.M. Travis M.A. Kudo M. Sheppard D. Epithelial cells utilize cortical actin/myosin to activate latent TGF-β through integrin αvβ6-dependent physical force.Exp. Cell Res. 2012; 318: 716-722Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). Because TGF-β is a critical molecule in immune regulation, the lack of TGF-β compromises immune tolerance and causes severe autoimmune disorders (18.Aoki C.A. Borchers A.T. Li M. Flavell R.A. Bowlus C.L. Ansari A.A. Gershwin M.E. Transforming growth factor β (TGF-β) and autoimmunity.Autoimmun. Rev. 2005; 4: 450-459Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar). Other investigators report that αvβ6 contributes to the development of immune tolerance (7.Liu T. Liang X. Li T.L. Ma J. Yang J.F. Yang P.C. Staphylococcal enterotoxin B compromises the immune tolerant status in the airway mucosa.Clin. Exp. Allergy. 2012; 42: 375-382Crossref PubMed Scopus (2) Google Scholar, 19.Yang S.B. Du Y. Wu B.Y.

Our data indicate that a fraction of B cells also contains αvβ6 and has an immune suppressor feature. The present data indicate that B cells contribute immune regulation, apart from via releasing IL-10 (20.Jeong Y.I. Hong S.H. Cho S.H. Lee W.J. Lee S.E. Induction of IL-10-producing CD1d high CD5+ regulatory B cells following Babesia microti infection.PLoS One. 2012; 7: e46553Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar, 21.Yang M. Deng J. Liu Y.

J. Pathol. 2012; 180: 2375-2385Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar), and a fraction of αvβ6-containing B cells may contribute to immune tolerance. Similar to the tolerogenic dendritic cells, the CX3CR1+ B cells also express lower levels of costimulatory molecules as shown by the present data. αvβ6 is produced by epithelial cells or endothelial cells; it attaches to the plasma membrane and is not a secretory protein. Thus, it is not expected to detect αvβ6 in the body fluid. However, it can be carried by exosomes; the latter can be captured by immune cells. For example, Chen et al. (10.Chen X. Song C.H. Feng B.S. Li T.L. Li P. Zheng P.Y. Chen X.M. Xing Z. Yang P.C. Intestinal epithelial cell-derived integrin aβ6 plays an important role in the induction of regulatory T cells and inhibits an antigen-specific Th2 response.J. Leukoc. Biol. 2011; 90: 751-759Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar) reported that intestinal epithelial cell-derived exosomes carried αvβ6 that could be captured by dendritic cells. Our data also show that human vascular endothelial cell line expresses the αvβ6 and CX3CL1. It seems that CX3CR1+ B cells capture the epithelial cell-derived αvβ6 via the interaction of CX3CR1/CX3CL1. The expression of CX3CL1 by epithelial cells is also reported by others (22.Maeda S.

There are some other immune regulatory cells, such as regulatory T cells, in the body that play important roles in the maintenance of the homeostasis. We propose that the CX3CR1+ B cells, compared with regulatory T cells, may be more, or at least equally, important in the immune regulation of the mucosa because the ligand of CX3CR1 (the CX3CL1) is expressed by epithelial cells; the chemotactic force makes CX3CR1+ B cells move to the subepithelial region to fulfill the immune regulatory task. After synthesis, TGF-β exists as a precursor, the LTGF-β; the latter needs to be converted to the active form, TGF-β, to fulfill the immune regulatory function. αvβ6 can remove the latency-associated peptide from TGF-β precursor (25.Shi M. Zhu J. Wang R. Chen X. Mi L. Walz T. Springer T.A. Latent TGF-β structure and activation.Nature. 2011; 474: 343-349Crossref PubMed Scopus (681) Google Scholar). Our data are consistent with the previous studies (10.Chen X. Song C.H. Feng B.S. Li T.L. Li P. Zheng P.Y. Chen X.M. Xing Z. Yang P.C. Intestinal epithelial cell-derived integrin aβ6 plays an important role in the induction of regulatory T cells and inhibits an antigen-specific Th2 response.J. Leukoc. Biol. 2011; 90: 751-759Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar); the αvβ6-containing CX3CR1+ B cells are also TGF-β-positive. It is reported that exogenous TGF-β can induce Tregs (26.Dons E.M. Raimondi G. Cooper D.K. Thomson A.W. Induced regulatory T cells: mechanisms of conversion and suppressive potential.Hum. Immunol. 2012; 73: 328-334Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). The present data suggest that the CX3CR1+ B cells are one of the immune regulatory cells in the body. The inference is supported by further data showing that CX3CR1+ B cells efficiently suppressed T cell proliferation. Supporting data have been reported by Liu et al. (27.Liu Z.Q. Wu Y. Song J.P. Liu X. Liu Z. Zheng P.Y. Yang P.C. Tolerogenic CX3CR1+ B cells suppress food allergy-induced intestinal inflammation in mice.Allergy. 2013; 68: 1241-1248Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar), who show that CX3CR1+ B cells facilitate the generation of regulatory T cells. In summary, the present data define a subfraction of B cells expressing CX3CR1 that contain αvβ6 and TGF-β; the cells have immune suppressor properties."
https://openalex.org/W2084918926,"Celiac disease (CD) is a gluten sensitive enteropathy characterized by a marked infiltration of the mucosa with immune cells, over-production of inflammatory cytokines and epithelial cell damage. The factors/mechanisms that sustain and amplify the ongoing mucosal inflammation in CD are not however fully understood. Here, we have examined whether in CD there is a defective clearance of apoptotic cells/bodies, a phenomenon that helps promote tolerogenic signals thus liming pathogenic responses. Accumulation of apoptotic cells and bodies was more pronounced in the epithelial and lamina propria compartments of active CD patients as compared to inactive CD patients and normal controls. Expression of scavenger receptors, which are involved in the clearance of apoptotic cells/bodies, namely thrombospondin (TSP)-1, CD36 and CD61, was significantly reduced in active CD as compared to inactive CD and normal mucosal samples. Consistently, lamina propria mononuclear cells (LPMC) of active CD patients had diminished ability to phagocyte apoptotic cells. Interleukin (IL)-15, IL-21 and interferon-γ, cytokines over-produced in active CD, inhibited the expression of TSP-1, CD36, and CD61 in normal intestinal LPMC. These results indicate that CD-related inflammation is marked by diminished clearance of apoptotic cells/bodies, thus suggesting a role for such a defect in the ongoing mucosal inflammation in this disorder."
https://openalex.org/W2028281782,"Intrauterine environmental exposures have been shown to influence neonatal immunity and subsequent allergic disease development. We have previously shown that fewer lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-stimulated eosinophil-basophil (Eo/B) colonies grow from cord blood (CB) of high-atopic risk infants, compared to low-atopic risk infants. In the present study, we investigated whether a surrogate ex vivo TH2 milieu (i.e., either IL-4 or IL-13) could represent an underlying mechanism to explain our previous findings. CB CD34+ cells from healthy donors were cultured with IL-4 or IL-13 (in combination with LPS) and assessed for Eo/B differentiation using methylcellulose cultures and flow cytometry for related intracellular signalling pathways. Pharmacological inhibitors were added to the methylcellulose cultures to determine the effect of blocking intracellular signalling in CB CD34+ cells in relation to Eo/B colony forming unit (CFU) formation. Stimulation of CD34+ cells with IL-4, but not IL-13, reduced Eo/B CFU formation in the presence of LPS; this was found to be dependent on IL-4Rα and not IL-13Rα1. Additionally, IL-4 reduced the expression of ERK 1/2 after LPS stimulation, which was recovered by inhibition of IL-4Rα. While IL-13 did not have an inhibitory effect on ERK 1/2 expression, inhibition of ERK 1/2 significantly reduced Eo/B CFU formation. Thus, the responsiveness of CB CD34+ progenitor cells to LPS is differentially regulated by the TH2 cytokines, IL-4 and IL-13. This may have implications for in utero interactions between placental-derived pro-allergic cytokines and neonatal progenitor cells influencing Eo/B-mediated inflammatory responses in early life."
