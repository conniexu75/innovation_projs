https://openalex.org/W1972170345,"The mesenchymal-amoeboid transition (MAT) was proposed as a mechanism for cancer cells to adapt their migration mode to their environment. While the molecular pathways involved in this transition are well documented, the role of the microenvironment in the MAT is still poorly understood. Here, we investigated how confinement and adhesion affect this transition. We report that, in the absence of focal adhesions and under conditions of confinement, mesenchymal cells can spontaneously switch to a fast amoeboid migration phenotype. We identified two main types of fast migration—one involving a local protrusion and a second involving a myosin-II-dependent mechanical instability of the cell cortex that leads to a global cortical flow. Interestingly, transformed cells are more prone to adopt this fast migration mode. Finally, we propose a generic model that explains migration transitions and predicts a phase diagram of migration phenotypes based on three main control parameters: confinement, adhesion, and contractility."
https://openalex.org/W2170585188,"A central paradigm within virology is that each viral particle largely behaves as an independent infectious unit. Here, we demonstrate that clusters of enteroviral particles are packaged within phosphatidylserine (PS) lipid-enriched vesicles that are non-lytically released from cells and provide greater infection efficiency than free single viral particles. We show that vesicular PS lipids are co-factors to the relevant enterovirus receptors in mediating subsequent infectivity and transmission, in particular to primary human macrophages. We demonstrate that clustered packaging of viral particles within vesicles enables multiple viral RNA genomes to be collectively transferred into single cells. This study reveals a novel mode of viral transmission, where enteroviral genomes are transmitted from cell-to-cell en bloc in membrane-bound PS vesicles instead of as single independent genomes. This has implications for facilitating genetic cooperativity among viral quasispecies as well as enhancing viral replication."
https://openalex.org/W1984474513,"3D amoeboid cell migration is central to many developmental and disease-related processes such as cancer metastasis. Here, we identify a unique prototypic amoeboid cell migration mode in early zebrafish embryos, termed stable-bleb migration. Stable-bleb cells display an invariant polarized balloon-like shape with exceptional migration speed and persistence. Progenitor cells can be reversibly transformed into stable-bleb cells irrespective of their primary fate and motile characteristics by increasing myosin II activity through biochemical or mechanical stimuli. Using a combination of theory and experiments, we show that, in stable-bleb cells, cortical contractility fluctuations trigger a stochastic switch into amoeboid motility, and a positive feedback between cortical flows and gradients in contractility maintains stable-bleb cell polarization. We further show that rearward cortical flows drive stable-bleb cell migration in various adhesive and non-adhesive environments, unraveling a highly versatile amoeboid migration phenotype."
https://openalex.org/W2055891785,"PTX3 is an essential component of the humoral arm of innate immunity, playing a nonredundant role in resistance against selected microbes and in the regulation of inflammation. PTX3 activates and regulates the Complement cascade by interacting with C1q and with Factor H. PTX3 deficiency was associated with increased susceptibility to mesenchymal and epithelial carcinogenesis. Increased susceptibility of Ptx3(-/-) mice was associated with enhanced macrophage infiltration, cytokine production, angiogenesis, and Trp53 mutations. Correlative evidence, gene-targeted mice, and pharmacological blocking experiments indicated that PTX3 deficiency resulted in amplification of Complement activation, CCL2 production, and tumor-promoting macrophage recruitment. PTX3 expression was epigenetically regulated in selected human tumors (e.g., leiomyosarcomas and colorectal cancer) by methylation of the promoter region and of a putative enhancer. Thus, PTX3, an effector molecule belonging to the humoral arm of innate immunity, acts as an extrinsic oncosuppressor gene in mouse and man by regulating Complement-dependent, macrophage-sustained, tumor-promoting inflammation."
https://openalex.org/W1967199837,"AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) is a master sensor and regulator of cellular energy status. Upon metabolic stress, AMPK suppresses anabolic and promotes catabolic processes to regain energy homeostasis. Cancer cells can occasionally suppress the growth-restrictive AMPK pathway by mutation of an upstream regulatory kinase. Here, we describe a widespread mechanism to suppress AMPK through its ubiquitination and degradation by the cancer-specific MAGE-A3/6-TRIM28 ubiquitin ligase. MAGE-A3 and MAGE-A6 are highly similar proteins normally expressed only in the male germline but frequently re-activated in human cancers. MAGE-A3/6 are necessary for cancer cell viability and are sufficient to drive tumorigenic properties of non-cancerous cells. Screening for targets of MAGE-A3/6-TRIM28 revealed that it ubiquitinates and degrades AMPKα1. This leads to inhibition of autophagy, activation of mTOR signaling, and hypersensitization to AMPK agonists, such as metformin. These findings elucidate a germline mechanism commonly hijacked in cancer to suppress AMPK."

Following environmental challenges, cells stimulate production of heat-shock proteins (HSPs). This HSP induction is the hallmark of the heat-shock, or proteotoxic stress, response (PSR) (Lindquist, 1986Lindquist S. The heat-shock response.Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1986; 55: 1151-1191Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). As molecular chaperones, HSPs facilitate folding, transportation, and degradation of other proteins (Morimoto, 2008Morimoto R.I. Proteotoxic stress and inducible chaperone networks in neurodegenerative disease and aging.Genes Dev. 2008; 22: 1427-1438Crossref PubMed Scopus (694) Google Scholar). In guarding the proteome against misfolding and aggregation, the PSR preserves proteostasis (Balch et al., 2008Balch W.E. Morimoto R.I. Dillin A. Kelly J.W. Adapting proteostasis for disease intervention.Science. 2008; 319: 916-919Crossref PubMed Scopus (1748) Google Scholar). In vertebrates, heat shock transcription factors (HSFs) govern the PSR. Among them is HSF1, the master regulator of this response (Morimoto, 2008Morimoto R.I. Proteotoxic stress and inducible chaperone networks in neurodegenerative disease and aging.Genes Dev. 2008; 22: 1427-1438Crossref PubMed Scopus (694) Google Scholar, Xiao et al., 1999Xiao X. Zuo X. Davis A.A. McMillan D.R. Curry B.B. Richardson J.A. Benjamin I.J. HSF1 is required for extra-embryonic development, postnatal growth and protection during inflammatory responses in mice.EMBO J. 1999; 18: 5943-5952Crossref PubMed Scopus (447) Google Scholar). As a multi-step process, HSF1 activation entails trimerization, nuclear translocation, posttranslational modifications, and DNA binding (Morimoto, 2008Morimoto R.I. Proteotoxic stress and inducible chaperone networks in neurodegenerative disease and aging.Genes Dev. 2008; 22: 1427-1438Crossref PubMed Scopus (694) Google Scholar). Yet, our understanding of this process remains incomplete. The HSF1-mediated PSR antagonizes many pathological conditions, including hyperthermia, heavy-metal toxification, ischemia, and reperfusion, and oxidative damage, and impacts aging and neurodegeneration (Dai et al., 2012aDai C. Dai S. Cao J. Proteotoxic stress of cancer: implication of the heat-shock response in oncogenesis.J. Cell. Physiol. 2012; 227: 2982-2987Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). HSF1, not surprisingly, acts as a longevity factor (Hsu et al., 2003Hsu A.L. Murphy C.T. Kenyon C. Regulation of aging and age-related disease by DAF-16 and heat-shock factor.Science. 2003; 300: 1142-1145Crossref PubMed Scopus (1121) Google Scholar). In contrast, our and others’ work has revealed a pro-oncogenic role of HSF1 (Dai et al., 2007Dai C. Whitesell L. Rogers A.B. Lindquist S.

Selective suppression of lymphomas by functional loss of Hsf1 in a p53-deficient mouse model for spontaneous tumors.Oncogene. 2007; 26: 5086-5097Crossref PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar). Despite its dispensability under non-stress conditions, HSF1 is crucial for tumor cells’ growth and survival (Dai et al., 2007Dai C. Whitesell L. Rogers A.B. Lindquist S. Heat shock factor 1 is a powerful multifaceted modifier of carcinogenesis.Cell. 2007; 130: 1005-1018Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (628) Google Scholar). Nonetheless, the mechanisms underlying its activation in malignancy remain unclear. Here, we report that RAS-MEK-ERK signaling critically regulates the PSR. It is MEK that phosphorylates and activates HSF1. MEK inhibition destabilizes the proteome, provoking protein aggregation and amyloidogenesis. Combinatorial proteasome blockade potently augments this tumor-suppressive amyloidogenic effect. Hence, our findings not only suggest HSF1 as a new MEK substrate but also uncover a biological function of RAS-MEK-ERK signaling in governing proteostasis. Beyond shifting the canonical view of RAS-MEK-ERK signaling, our proof-of-concept experiments suggest that intrinsic proteomic instability associated with malignant state may be exploited to combat cancer. Phosphorylation notably impacts HSF1 activation (Guettouche et al., 2005Guettouche T. Boellmann F. Lane W.S. Voellmy R. Analysis of phosphorylation of human heat shock factor 1 in cells experiencing a stress.BMC Biochem. 2005; 6: 4Crossref PubMed Scopus (229) Google Scholar), suggesting a key role of signaling pathways. To illuminate how such pathways regulate the PSR, we first examined their responses to stress, focusing on RAS-MEK-ERK signaling. To inflict proteotoxic stress, we applied stressors with diverse mechanisms of action, including heat shock (HS), proteasome inhibitor MG132, histone deacetylase 6 inhibitor tubastatin, amino-acid analog azetidine, and HSP inhibitors (17-DMAG for HSP90 and VER155008 for HSP70) (Kawaguchi et al., 2003Kawaguchi Y.

Workman P. Hsp90 molecular chaperone inhibitors: are we there yet?.Clin. Cancer Res. 2012; 18: 64-76Crossref PubMed Scopus (746) Google Scholar). Transient exposure to stressors did not impair cell viability (Figure S1A), but elevated phosphorylation of MEK and ERK (Figure 1A), two key components of this pathway. MEK Ser218/222 and ERK Thr202/Tyr204 phosphorylation signify their active state (Dhillon et al., 2007Dhillon A.S. Hagan S. Rath O. Kolch W. MAP kinase signalling pathways in cancer.Oncogene. 2007; 26: 3279-3290Crossref PubMed Scopus (2152) Google Scholar, Roux and Blenis, 2004Roux P.P. Blenis J. ERK and p38 MAPK-activated protein kinases: a family of protein kinases with diverse biological functions.Microbiol. Mol. Biol. Rev. 2004; 68: 320-344Crossref PubMed Scopus (1924) Google Scholar). Congruently, all stressors activated ELK1 (Figure 1B), a transcription factor downstream of ERK (Roux and Blenis, 2004Roux P.P. Blenis J. ERK and p38 MAPK-activated protein kinases: a family of protein kinases with diverse biological functions.Microbiol. Mol. Biol. Rev. 2004; 68: 320-344Crossref PubMed Scopus (1924) Google Scholar). To determine whether MEK-ERK signaling regulates the PSR, we employed U0126 and AZD6244, two specific MEK1/2 inhibitors (Favata et al., 1998Favata M.F. Horiuchi K.Y. Manos E.J. Daulerio A.J. Stradley D.A. Feeser W.S. Van Dyk D.E. Pitts W.J. Earl R.A. Hobbs F. et al.Identification of a novel inhibitor of mitogen-activated protein kinase kinase.J. Biol.

Cancer Res. 2007; 13: 1576-1583Crossref PubMed Scopus (476) Google Scholar). Both inhibitors impeded the HS-induced transcription of Hsp genes and impaired the DNA-binding capacity and transcriptional activation of HSF1 (Figures 1C–1F and S1B), suggesting that MEK activates the HSF1-mediated PSR. ERK, phosphorylated by MEK (Ahn et al., 1991Ahn N.G. Seger R. Bratlien R.L. Diltz C.D. Tonks N.K. Krebs E.G. Multiple components in an epidermal growth factor-stimulated protein kinase cascade. In vitro activation of a myelin basic protein/microtubule-associated protein 2 kinase.J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 4220-4227PubMed Google Scholar), is widely recognized as the master effector of this pathway (Dhillon et al., 2007Dhillon A.S. Hagan S. Rath O. Kolch W. MAP kinase signalling pathways in cancer.Oncogene. 2007; 26: 3279-3290Crossref PubMed Scopus (2152) Google Scholar, Roux and Blenis, 2004Roux P.P. Blenis J.

Surprisingly, ERK inhibitors, FR180204 and Sch772984 (Ohori et al., 2005Ohori M. Kinoshita T. Okubo M. Sato K. Yamazaki A. Arakawa H. Nishimura S. Inamura N. Nakajima H.

Black S. et al.Discovery of a novel ERK inhibitor with activity in models of acquired resistance to BRAF and MEK inhibitors.Cancer Discov. 2013; 3: 742-750Crossref PubMed Scopus (461) Google Scholar), activated HSF1 (Figures 1F and S1C). Both MEK and ERK inhibitors impaired two ERK-mediated events—MSK1 phosphorylation and ELK1 activation (Figures 1G and S1D) (Roux and Blenis, 2004Roux P.P. Blenis J. ERK and p38 MAPK-activated protein kinases: a family of protein kinases with diverse biological functions.Microbiol. Mol. Biol. Rev. 2004; 68: 320-344Crossref PubMed Scopus (1924) Google Scholar). While MEK inhibitors reduced ERK phosphorylation, two ERK inhibitors showed distinct effects (Figure 1G). Sch772984 suppressed ERK phosphorylation, likely due to ERK conformational changes that block MEK-mediated phosphorylation (Morris et al., 2013Morris E.J. Jha S. Restaino C.R. Dayananth P. Zhu H. Cooper A. Carr D. Deng Y. Jin W. Black S. et al.Discovery of a novel ERK inhibitor with activity in models of acquired resistance to BRAF and MEK inhibitors.Cancer Discov. 2013; 3: 742-750Crossref PubMed Scopus (461) Google Scholar); conversely, FR180204 promoted ERK phosphorylation (Figure 1G), suggesting feedback MEK activation. The impacts of MEK and ERK inhibitors on HSF1 were validated via genetic depletions of MEK and ERK (Figures 1I–1O). While depletion of one ERK isoform diminished the other isoform at the protein level (Figures 1L and 1N), mRNA levels of the isoform not targeted were elevated (Figures S1E–S1H), suggesting posttranscriptional mechanisms underlying reduced proteins. These results not only pinpoint RAS-MEK-ERK signaling as a key regulator of the PSR, but also reveal divergent impacts of MEK and ERK on HSF1. To determine whether MEK directly activates HSF1, we examined endogenous MEK-HSF1 interactions by co-immunoprecipitation (coIP). While no evident MEK1/2 proteins were precipitated with HSF1 without HS, HS caused a marked coIP (Figures 2A and 2B ), showing a stress-inducible MEK-HSF1 interaction. The mobility shift of HSF1 marks HS-induced phosphorylation (Figure 2A). These MEK-HSF1 interactions were verified via expression of recombinant proteins (Figures S2A and S2B). To determine whether MEK and HSF1 are in direct contact, we employed the Proximity Ligation Assay (PLA) technique (Clausson et al., 2011Clausson C.M. Allalou A. Weibrecht I. Mahmoudi S. Farnebo M. Landegren U. Wählby C. Söderberg O. Increasing the dynamic range of in situ PLA.Nat. Methods. 2011; 8: 892-893Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). Antibody specificities were validated by immunostaining (Figures S2C and S2D). In MEK-proficient cells, PLA signals were marginally visible without HS and HS intensified these signals (Figure 2C). In MEK-deficient cells, only faint signals were detected even after HS (Figure 2C), confirming the specificity of PLA. Of note, PLA signals were more manifest in the nucleus than in the cytoplasm (Figure 2C), revealing a prominently nuclear localization of interactions. These results strongly suggest a direct MEK-HSF1 association.Figure S2MEK Physically Interacts with HSF1, Related to Figure 2Show full caption(A and B) HSF1 is co-precipitated with MEK1 and MEK2.

Scale bar: 50 μm. MEK1 and MEK2 form either homo- or heterodimers in vivo (Catalanotti et al., 2009Catalanotti F. Reyes G. Jesenberger V. Galabova-Kovacs G. de Matos Simoes R. Carugo O. Baccarini M. A Mek1-Mek2 heterodimer determines the strength and duration of the Erk signal.Nat. Struct. Mol. Biol. 2009; 16: 294-303Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar). To address which type of dimer binds HSF1, we examined MEK1-HSF1 interactions in the deficiency of MEK2. Under HS, more MEK1 proteins were precipitated with HSF1 in MEK2-deficient cells (Figure 2D). Similarly, MEK1 deficiency heightened MEK2-HSF1 interactions (Figure 2E), revealing a competition between the two MEK isoforms for HSF1 binding and suggesting that MEK homodimers can interact with HSF1. To elucidate how ERK inactivates HSF1, we first examined the impact of ERK on MEK-mediated HSF1 activation. Whereas ERK1 depletion promoted MEK-HSF1 interactions (Figure 2F), ERK1 overexpression mitigated these interactions and suppressed HSF1 (Figures 2G and S2E). Thus, we contemplated three possible scenarios (Figure 2H): (1) both MEK substrates, ERK and HSF1, compete for MEK interaction; (2) ERK, like MEK, binds HSF1 and thereby competes for HSF1 interaction; and (3) ERK inhibits MEK kinase activity toward HSF1. Each of the first two scenarios predicts competition between two protein complexes; in contrast, the third scenario predicts that ERK assembles with MEK and HSF1 into a single protein complex. Interestingly, under HS HSF1 precipitated both MEK and ERK (Figure 2I), and ERK precipitated both MEK and HSF1 (Figure 2J). Although these results do not exclude the existence of independent MEK-ERK and MEK-HSF1 complexes, they argue against the two complexes being stable and prevalent, as depicted in the first scenario. To test the second scenario, we detected ERK-HSF1 interactions by PLA, as this scenario predicts HSF1 as a substrate for both ERK and MEK. The specificity of ERK antibodies was validated in ERK-depleted cells (Figure S2F). In contrast to evident MEK1-ERK interactions (Figure 2K), no apparent PLA signals denoting ERK-HSF1 interactions were detected (Figure 2L), suggesting lack of direct contact between these two proteins. Moreover, while ERK1 overexpression mitigated MEK-HSF1 interactions, less ERK1 proteins were precipitated with HSF1 (Figure 2G), conflicting with heightened ERK1-HSF1 interactions predicted by the second scenario. Thus, these results not only refute the second scenario but also suggest that ERK complexes with HSF1 via MEK, in line with the third scenario. Importantly, MEK depletion markedly diminished ERK-HSF1 coIP (Figure 2J). These results suggest existence of a protein complex comprising ERK, MEK, and HSF1, wherein ERK suppresses HSF1 indirectly, via inhibition of MEK. Under HS, HSF1 undergoes a series of phosphorylating events, among which Ser326 phosphorylation stimulates its activation (Guettouche et al., 2005Guettouche T. Boellmann F. Lane W.S. Voellmy R. Analysis of phosphorylation of human heat shock factor 1 in cells experiencing a stress.BMC Biochem. 2005; 6: 4Crossref PubMed Scopus (229) Google Scholar). Yet, the identity of the kinase remains elusive. To determine whether MEK phosphorylates Ser326, we examined the effect of MEK blockade on this modification using a phosphospecific antibody that recognized HSF1WT, but not HSF1S326A, proteins (Figure S3A). Either MEK knockdown or U0126 treatment impaired Ser326 phosphorylation (Figures 3A and S3B). Conversely, a constitutively active mutant, MEK1DD (S218D/S222D) (Brunet et al., 1994aBrunet A. Pagès G. Pouysségur J. Constitutively active mutants of MAP kinase kinase (MEK1) induce growth factor-relaxation and oncogenicity when expressed in fibroblasts.Oncogene. 1994; 9: 3379-3387PubMed Google Scholar), induced Ser326 phosphorylation and activation of HSF1 without HS (Figures 3B and 3C). ERK inhibition enhanced Ser326 phosphorylation, and MEK depletion abolished this effect (Figures 3D and S3C), indicating MEK-dependent regulation. HSF1S326A mutants displayed impaired transcriptional activities (Figure 3E), congruent with their defective nuclear translocation and DNA-binding capacity (Figures S3D and 3F). Moreover, HSF1 proteins were reduced in MEK-deficient cells (Figures 3A and S3E). To determine whether MEK impacts HSF1 stability, we performed cycloheximide chase experiments. MEK depletion shortened the half-life of HSF1WT protein; importantly, while HSF1S326A mutants were less stable in MEK-proficient cells, their stability was not evidently affected by MEK deficiency (Figure 3G), suggesting that MEK stabilizes HSF1 largely via Ser326 phosphorylation.

In vitro, recombinant MEK1 proteins directly phosphorylated HSF1 at Ser326, and U0126 blocked this event (Figure 3H). ERK was reported to phosphorylate HSF1 at Ser307 (Chu et al., 1998Chu B. Zhong R. Soncin F. Stevenson M.A. Calderwood S.K. Transcriptional activity of heat shock factor 1 at 37 degrees C is repressed through phosphorylation on two distinct serine residues by glycogen synthase kinase 3 and protein kinases Calpha and Czeta.J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 18640-18646Crossref PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar), implying a direct ERK-HSF1 interaction. To exclude direct Ser326 phosphorylation by ERK, we performed in vitro HSF1 phosphorylation using immunoprecipitated endogenous ERK complexes that would comprise ERK associated with or without MEK. Although precipitated complexes phosphorylated Ser326, this event was blocked by U0126, but not by FR180204 (Figure 3I). U0126, but not FR180204, blocked phosphorylation of recombinant ERK1 proteins by the same precipitates (Figure 3I). In contrast, FR180204, but not U0126, blocked phosphorylation of myelin basic protein (MBP), a known ERK substrate (Ahn et al., 1991Ahn N.G. Seger R. Bratlien R.L. Diltz C.D. Tonks N.K. Krebs E.G. Multiple components in an epidermal growth factor-stimulated protein kinase cascade. In vitro activation of a myelin basic protein/microtubule-associated protein 2 kinase.J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 4220-4227PubMed Google Scholar), by the same precipitates (Figure 3I), showing ERK blockade by FR180204. These results strongly suggest that MEK, rather than ERK, directly phosphorylates Ser326. Moreover, recombinant ERK1 proteins impeded in vitro HSF1 Ser326 phosphorylation by recombinant MEK1 proteins (Figure 3J), consistent with the suppression of Ser326 phosphorylation by ERK in vivo. In contrast, ERK promotes HSF1 Ser307 phosphorylation. ERK depletion diminished Ser307 phosphorylation, however, this effect was largely abolished in MEK-deficient cells (Figure S3F), again indicating MEK dependence. MEK inhibition impaired Ser326 phosphorylation but enhanced Ser307 phosphorylation of HSF1WT proteins (Figure S3G). Interes"
https://openalex.org/W2065533930,"Interferon-stimulated genes (ISGs) act in concert to provide a tight barrier against viruses. Recent studies have shed light on the contribution of individual ISG effectors to the antiviral state, but most have examined those acting on early, intracellular stages of the viral life cycle. Here, we applied an image-based screen to identify ISGs inhibiting late stages of influenza A virus (IAV) infection. We unraveled a directly antiviral function for the gene SERPINE1, encoding plasminogen activator inhibitor 1 (PAI-1). By targeting extracellular airway proteases, PAI-1 inhibits IAV glycoprotein cleavage, thereby reducing infectivity of progeny viruses. This was biologically relevant for IAV restriction in vivo. Further, partial PAI-1 deficiency, attributable to a polymorphism in human SERPINE1, conferred increased susceptibility to IAV in vitro. Together, our findings reveal that manipulating the extracellular environment to inhibit the last step in a virus life cycle is an important mechanism of the antiviral response."

Thus, harnessing this mechanism for anti-pain therapy may prevent adverse effects associated with currently available TRPV1 blockers. Pathological forms of pain are usually triggered by injury or inflammation of peripheral sensory neurons of the pain pathway. A diverse set of inflammatory stimuli can sensitize nociceptive neurons to promote pain hypersensitivity. As a consequence, inhibition of individual inflammatory pathways as a means to attenuate pain is a problematic approach for drug development, as parallel signaling cascades are still able to drive pathological, pain-promoting sensitization (Gold and Gebhart, 2010Gold M.S. Gebhart G.F. Nociceptor sensitization in pain pathogenesis.Nat. Med. 2010; 16: 1248-1257Crossref PubMed Scopus (505) Google Scholar). One receptor that has been found to serve as downstream integrator of many inflammatory pathways and thus holds great hope for anti-pain therapy is the capsaicin receptor TRPV1 (Caterina et al., 1997Caterina M.J. Schumacher M.A. Tominaga M. Rosen T.A. Levine J.D. Julius D.

Next to its physiological function as a detector of noxious stimuli, a large body of literature attests to a crucial pathological role for TRPV1. Importantly, inflammatory sensitization leads to dramatically reduced activation thresholds of TRPV1, producing hyperalgesia and pain hypersensitivity. Indeed, Trpv1−/− animals completely lack thermal hyperalgesia, confirming TRPV1’s central role as integrator of disparate inflammatory pathways (Caterina et al., 2000Caterina M.J. Leffler A. Malmberg A.B. Martin W.J. Trafton J. Petersen-Zeitz K.R. Koltzenburg M. Basbaum A.I. Julius D.

TRPV1’s central role in pathological forms of pain has sparked intense efforts to develop TRPV1 antagonists. However, blocking TRPV1 activity per se leads to impaired noxious heat sensation and produces hypothermia, attesting to a role of this temperature-gated receptor in homeostatic thermoregulation. Therefore, preventing and counteracting sensitization of the receptor while leaving basal TRPV1 activity untouched has been suggested to be a more promising avenue for pain therapy (Szallasi and Sheta, 2012Szallasi A.

Combining mouse genetics with proteomics, here we report the identification of the GABAB1 receptor as a modulator of TRPV1 sensitization. Canonical GABAB signaling requires GABAB1 and GABAB2 receptor subunits to orchestrate activation of inhibitory G proteins (Gassmann et al., 2004Gassmann M. Shaban H. Vigot R. Sansig G. Haller C.

Surprisingly, the GABAB2 subunit is dispensable for mediating inhibition of TRPV1 sensitization, demonstrating that the underlying mechanism diverges from canonical GABAB receptor signaling. Collectively, our results establish an endogenous GABA/GABAB1 feedback mechanism that keeps TRPV1-mediated pain hypersensitivity in check. Given the complex integrative function of the capsaicin receptor, we reasoned that analysis of TRPV1 accessory proteins would shed light on unrecognized modulation of the receptor. Therefore, we utilized a genetic-biochemical approach to identify components of TRPV1 protein complexes isolated from native sensory tissue of transgenic animals. To achieve efficient and specific biochemical purification of TRPV1 protein complexes for downstream analysis by mass spectrometry, we generated mice expressing an affinity-tagged version of TRPV1 (Tag-TRPV1, Figure 1A). Western blotting of protein extracts derived from sensory ganglia (dorsal root ganglia, DRG) of transgenic animals revealed the expected size of the tagged receptor protein, which is slightly shifted toward higher molecular weight compared to native (untagged) TRPV1 (Figure 1B). To assure identification of physiological relevant TRPV1 protein complex components, we first verified cell-type-specific expression and functionality of the tagged receptor in BAC transgenic animals. Tag-TRPV1 expression recapitulated the native profile in DRG (Figures 1C, S1A, and S1B). Accordingly, the tagged receptor rescued capsaicin responses in DRG sensory neurons derived from transgenic animals crossed onto the TRPV1 knockout background (Figures 1D and S1C). Importantly, the Tag did not impair trafficking of TRPV1 to peripheral and central nerve terminals (Figures 1E and S1D). Finally, we tested TRPV1-dependent nociceptive behavior. Whereas we observed normal responses to heat stimuli in a transgenic mouse line expressing close to physiological levels of Tag-TRPV1, a second line, expressing high levels of the tagged receptor (Figure S1E), exhibited significantly reduced pain thresholds (Figure S1F). These findings not only prove the functionality of the tagged receptor in vivo but also underscore TRPV1’s predominance in mediating heat hyperalgesia. Next, utilizing the Strep or Flag moiety of the tagged receptor, we affinity purified protein complexes extracted from DRG of transgenic animals expressing both the tagged and the native form of the receptor. Wild-type animals devoid of the tagged receptor served as control. Mass spectrometry revealed the presence of TRPV2—a TRP family member previously shown to interact with TRPV1 (Rutter et al., 2005Rutter A.R. Ma Q.P. Leveridge M. Bonnert T.P. Heteromerization and colocalization of TrpV1 and TrpV2 in mammalian cell lines and rat dorsal root ganglia.Neuroreport. 2005; 16: 1735-1739Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar)—in purified protein complexes, further validating our approach. The GABAB1 receptor subunit was identified as one of the most abundant components of native TRPV1 protein complexes, regardless of Tag-TRPV1 expression level (Figures 2A and S2A and Table S1).Figure S2Characterization of TRPV1-GABAB Protein Complexes, Related to Figure 2Show full caption(A) Quantitative mass spectrometry of affinity purified samples derived from DRG of mice expressing high and low amounts of Tag-TRPV1, with samples of WT mice serving as controls for unspecific binding to the affinity matrix.

Interestingly, GABAB receptors in the CNS have long been known to mediate analgesia (Sokal and Chapman, 2003Sokal D.M. Chapman V. Inhibitory effects of spinal baclofen on spinal dorsal horn neurones in inflamed and neuropathic rats in vivo.Brain Res. 2003; 987: 67-75Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). However, GABAB mechanisms specifically targeting the peripheral nociceptive pathway have not been identified. Surprisingly, GABAB receptors are robustly expressed in peripheral nociceptive neurons (Charles et al., 2001Charles K.J. Evans M.L. Robbins M.J. Calver A.R. Leslie R.A. Pangalos M.N. Comparative immunohistochemical localisation of GABA(B1a), GABA(B1b) and GABA(B2) subunits in rat brain, spinal cord and dorsal root ganglion.Neuroscience. 2001; 106: 447-467Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar, Towers et al., 2000Towers S.

Neurosci. 2000; 12: 3201-3210Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar), suggesting an unrecognized role for GABAB in the pain pathway. We were able to confirm these results and found that most, if not all, TRPV1-positive sensory neurons express the GABAB1 subunit (Figure 2B). We validated the presence of GABAB1 in TRPV1 protein complexes by immunoprecipitation (IP) of Tag-TRPV1 or GABAB1 (Figures 2C and 2D). To further confirm the close proximity of the two transmembrane receptors in their native environment, we carried out proximity ligation assays (PLA). In this assay, a fluorescent signal is generated when two proteins of interest either physically interact directly or coexist within close molecular distance (Söderberg et al., 2006Söderberg O. Gullberg M. Jarvius M. Ridderstråle K. Leuchowius K.J. Jarvius J. Wester K. Hydbring P. Bahram F. Larsson L.G. Landegren U. Direct observation of individual endogenous protein complexes in situ by proximity ligation.Nat. Methods. 2006; 3: 995-1000Crossref PubMed Scopus (1754) Google Scholar). We therefore cultured DRG neurons of Tag-Trpv1 mice and wild-type control animals and performed PLA using anti-Flag and anti-GABAB1 antibodies. A robust PLA signal was detected in Tag-Trpv1 neurons, but not in WT controls, demonstrating that a TRPV1-GABAB1 complex is present in intact sensory neurons and their projecting neurites (Figure 2E). Intriguingly, we were not able to detect the GABAB2 subunit either by mass spectrometry or by western blotting of TRPV1 protein complexes (Figures S2B and S2C). Similarly, KCTD proteins—found to constitutively interact with the GABAB2 receptor subunit (Schwenk et al., 2010Schwenk J. Metz M. Zolles G. Turecek R. Fritzius T. Bildl W. Tarusawa E. Kulik A. Unger A. Ivankova K. et al.Native GABA(B) receptors are heteromultimers with a family of auxiliary subunits.Nature. 2010; 465: 231-235Crossref PubMed Scopus (237) Google Scholar)—were absent, and only GABAB1 selectively co-purified with TRPV1 complexes. Additionally, when co-expressing TRPV1, GABAB1, and GABAB2, lower amounts of GABAB1 protein were detected in TRPV1 IPs when compared to samples containing TRPV1 and GABAB1 alone (Figures S2D and S2E). These findings suggested that TRPV1 and GABAB2 might compete for binding to GABAB1. To further examine this possibility, we carried out bioluminescence resonance energy transfer (BRET) assays (Ayoub and Pfleger, 2010Ayoub M.A. Pfleger K.D.

While GABAB BRET probes have been characterized previously (Adelfinger et al., 2014Adelfinger L. Turecek R. Ivankova K. Jensen A.A. Moss S.J. Gassmann M. Bettler B. GABAB receptor phosphorylation regulates KCTD12-induced K+ current desensitization.Biochem. Pharmacol. 2014; 91: 369-379Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar), we first confirmed the functionality of the TRPV1 BRET probes (Figures S2F and S2G). The BRET assay confirmed close association of TRPV1 and GABAB1 (Figure 2F). Again, no interaction was detectable between TRPV1 and GABAB2 (Figure 2G). Moreover, similar to the co-IP experiments (Figures S2D and S2E), co-expression of GABAB2 interfered with the interaction of Rluc-TRPV1 and GABAB1-YFP (Figure 2F), shown by the increased amount of BRET acceptor (GABAB1-YFP) required to reach 50% of the maximal BRET signal (Figures 2F, S2H, and S2I). In summary, GABAB1 and TRPV1 form a protein complex that appears to lack the G protein signaling subunit GABAB2. Given GABAB’s established role in modulating KIR3 and CaV channels (Padgett and Slesinger, 2010Padgett C.L. Slesinger P.A. GABAB receptor coupling to G-proteins and ion channels.Adv. Pharmacol. 2010; 58: 123-147Crossref PubMed Scopus (165) Google Scholar), it is conceivable that GABAB’s known analgesic property could stem in part from inhibiting TRPV1 activity. Different to its effect on KIR3 channels (Figure S3A), neither calcium imaging nor electrophysiological recordings revealed any influence of the GABAB agonist baclofen on TRPV1 currents elicited by capsaicin (Figures 3A and S3B). Tachyphylaxis, a form of rapid TRPV1 desensitization, was also not affected by baclofen application (Figure S3C).Figure 3Effect of Baclofen on Native TRPV1 Receptors in Cultured Sensory NeuronsShow full caption(A) Electrophysiological recordings of cultured DRG neurons.

Cells treated with vehicle or baclofen served as a negative control. Error bars represent SEM. See also Figure S3. Under inflammatory conditions, multiple pathways sensitize TRPV1. Paramount among the different inflammatory sensitizers is NGF, activating parallel TRKA receptor signaling cascades that converge on the capsaicin receptor to enhance its sensitivity. We thus tested whether NGF-mediated TRPV1 sensitization is modulated by GABAB activation. To this end, we monitored nociceptive neuron populations for NGF-enhanced TRPV1 activity using calcium imaging (Bonnington and McNaughton, 2003Bonnington J.K. McNaughton P.A. Signalling pathways involved in the sensitisation of mouse nociceptive neurones by nerve growth factor.J. Physiol. 2003; 551: 433-446Crossref PubMed Scopus (273) Google Scholar). Indeed, pre-incubation of sensory neurons with baclofen (but not saline) robustly blocked TRPV1 sensitization (Figures 3B, 3C, and S3D). Apart from the receptor tyrosine kinase TRKA, several G-protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) mediate TRPV1 sensitization (Figure 3C). Notorious in this regard are bradykinin- and serotonin-triggered GPCR cascades (Chuang et al., 2001Chuang H.H. Prescott E.D. Kong H. Shields S. Jordt S.E. Basbaum A.I. Chao M.V. Julius D.

Zhang X. McNaughton P.A. Inflammatory pain: the cellular basis of heat hyperalgesia.Curr. Neuropharmacol. 2006; 4: 197-206Crossref PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar). Strikingly, baclofen was equally effective in inhibiting TRPV1 sensitization induced by both inflammatory mediators (Figures 3C, S3E, and S3F). Given that the initial signaling events controlled by the two GPCRs are quite different to that of TRKA, these results suggest that GABAB exerts its effect at a converging point downstream of the different pathways, potentially at TRPV1 itself. In agreement with this hypothesis, bypassing upstream inflammatory receptor signaling by direct pharmacological PKC activation also resulted in baclofen-reversible TRPV1 sensitization (Figure 3C). The inflammatory prostaglandin PGE2 mediates TRPV1 sensitization largely via a Gs-coupled/PKA pathway (Gu et al., 2003Gu Q. Kwong K. Lee L.Y.

https://openalex.org/W2056338458,"Aneuploid genomes, characterized by unbalanced chromosome stoichiometry (karyotype), are associated with cancer malignancy and drug resistance of pathogenic fungi. The phenotypic diversity resulting from karyotypic diversity endows the cell population with superior adaptability. We show here, using a combination of experimental data and a general stochastic model, that the degree of phenotypic variation, thus evolvability, escalates with the degree of overall growth suppression. Such scaling likely explains the challenge of treating aneuploidy diseases with a single stress-inducing agent. Instead, we propose the design of an ""evolutionary trap"" (ET) targeting both karyotypic diversity and fitness. This strategy entails a selective condition ""channeling"" a karyotypically divergent population into one with a predominant and predictably drugable karyotypic feature. We provide a proof-of-principle case in budding yeast and demonstrate the potential efficacy of this strategy toward aneuploidy-based azole resistance in Candida albicans. By analyzing existing pharmacogenomics data, we propose the potential design of an ET against glioblastoma."
https://openalex.org/W1995275122,"Preeclampsia (PE) is a life-threatening hypertensive pathology of pregnancy affecting 3-5% of all pregnancies. To date, PE has no cure, early detection markers, or effective treatments short of the removal of what is thought to be the causative organ, the placenta, which may necessitate a preterm delivery. Additionally, numerous small placental microarray studies attempting to identify ""PE-specific"" genes have yielded inconsistent results. We therefore hypothesize that preeclampsia is a multifactorial disease encompassing several pathology subclasses, and that large cohort placental gene expression analysis will reveal these groups.To address our hypothesis, we utilized known bioinformatic methods to aggregate 7 microarray data sets across multiple platforms in order to generate a large data set of 173 patient samples, including 77 with preeclampsia. Unsupervised clustering of these patient samples revealed three distinct molecular subclasses of PE. This included a ""canonical"" PE subclass demonstrating elevated expression of known PE markers and genes associated with poor oxygenation and increased secretion, as well as two other subclasses potentially representing a poor maternal response to pregnancy and an immunological presentation of preeclampsia.Our analysis sheds new light on the heterogeneity of PE patients, and offers up additional avenues for future investigation. Hopefully, our subclassification of preeclampsia based on molecular diversity will finally lead to the development of robust diagnostics and patient-based treatments for this disorder."

These heavily marketed UPPs are cheap and convenient for consumers and profitable for manufacturers, but contain high levels of salt, fat and sugars. This study aimed to explore the potential mortality reduction associated with future policies for substantially reducing ultra-processed food intake in the UK.We obtained data from the UK Living Cost and Food Survey and from the National Diet and Nutrition Survey. By the NOVA food typology, all food items were categorized into three groups according to the extent of food processing: Group 1 describes unprocessed/minimally processed foods. Group 2 comprises processed culinary ingredients. Group 3 includes all processed or ultra-processed products. Using UK nutrient conversion tables, we estimated the energy and nutrient profile of each food group. We then used the IMPACT Food Policy model to estimate reductions in cardiovascular mortality from improved nutrient intakes reflecting shifts from processed or ultra-processed to unprocessed/minimally processed foods. We then conducted probabilistic sensitivity analyses using Monte Carlo simulation.Approximately 175,000 cardiovascular disease (CVD) deaths might be expected in 2030 if current mortality patterns persist. However, halving the intake of Group 3 (processed) foods could result in approximately 22,055 fewer CVD related deaths in 2030 (minimum estimate 10,705, maximum estimate 34,625). An ideal scenario in which salt and fat intakes are reduced to the low levels observed in Group 1 and 2 could lead to approximately 14,235 (minimum estimate 6,680, maximum estimate 22,525) fewer coronary deaths and approximately 7,820 (minimum estimate 4,025, maximum estimate 12,100) fewer stroke deaths, comprising almost 13% mortality reduction.This study shows a substantial potential for reducing the cardiovascular disease burden through a healthier food system. It highlights the crucial importance of implementing healthier UK food policies."

https://openalex.org/W2021541624,"LSD1, a lysine-specific histone demethylase, is overexpressed in several types of cancers and linked to poor outcomes. In breast cancer, the significance of LSD1 overexpression is not clear. We have performed an in silico analysis to assess the relationship of LSD1 expression to clinical outcome. We demonstrate that LSD1 overexpression is a poor prognostic factor in breast cancer, especially in basal-like breast cancer, a subtype of breast cancer with aggressive clinical features. This link is also observed in samples of triple negative breast cancer. Interestingly, we note that overexpression of LSD1 correlates with down-regulation of BRCA1 in triple negative breast cancer. This phenomenon is also observed in in vitro models of basal-like breast cancer, and is associated with an increased sensitivity to PARP inhibitors. We propose therefore that high expression levels of the demethylase LSD1 is a potential prognostic factor of poor outcome in basal-like breast cancer, and that PARP inhibition may be a therapeutic strategy of interest in this poor prognostic subtype with overexpression of LSD1."
https://openalex.org/W2100123523,"Background Vagus nerve stimulation is increasingly applied to treat epilepsy, psychiatric conditions and potentially chronic heart failure. After implanting vagus nerve electrodes to the cervical vagus nerve, side effects such as voice alterations and dyspnea or missing therapeutic effects are observed at different frequencies. Cervical vagus nerve branching might partly be responsible for these effects. However, vagus nerve branching has not yet been described in the context of vagus nerve stimulation. Materials and Methods Branching of the cervical vagus nerve was investigated macroscopically in 35 body donors (66 cervical sides) in the carotid sheath. After X-ray imaging for determining the vertebral levels of cervical vagus nerve branching, samples were removed to confirm histologically the nerve and to calculate cervical vagus nerve diameters and cross-sections. Results Cervical vagus nerve branching was observed in 29% of all cases (26% unilaterally, 3% bilaterally) and proven histologically in all cases. Right-sided branching (22%) was more common than left-sided branching (12%) and occurred on the level of the fourth and fifth vertebra on the left and on the level of the second to fifth vertebra on the right side. Vagus nerves without branching were significantly larger than vagus nerves with branches, concerning their diameters (4.79 mm vs. 3.78 mm) and cross-sections (7.24 mm2 vs. 5.28 mm2). Discussion Cervical vagus nerve branching is considerably more frequent than described previously. The side-dependent differences of vagus nerve branching may be linked to the asymmetric effects of the vagus nerve. Cervical vagus nerve branching should be taken into account when identifying main trunk of the vagus nerve for implanting electrodes to minimize potential side effects or lacking therapeutic benefits of vagus nerve stimulation."
https://openalex.org/W2047108864,"Addition of menthol to cigarettes may be associated with increased initiation of smoking. The potential mechanisms underlying this association are not known. Menthol, likely due to its effects on cold-sensing peripheral sensory neurons, is known to inhibit the sensation of irritation elicited by respiratory irritants. However, it remains unclear whether menthol modulates cigarette smoke irritancy and nicotine absorption during initial exposures to cigarettes, thereby facilitating smoking initiation. Using plethysmography in a C57Bl/6J mouse model, we examined the effects of L-menthol, the menthol isomer added to cigarettes, on the respiratory sensory irritation response to primary smoke irritants (acrolein and cyclohexanone) and smoke of Kentucky reference 2R4 cigarettes. We also studied L-menthol’s effect on blood levels of the nicotine metabolite, cotinine, immediately after exposure to cigarette smoke. L-menthol suppressed the irritation response to acrolein with an apparent IC₅₀ of 4 ppm. Suppression was observed even at acrolein levels well above those necessary to produce a maximal response. Cigarette smoke, at exposure levels of 10 mg/m³ or higher, caused an immediate and marked sensory irritation response in mice. This response was significantly suppressed by L-menthol even at smoke concentrations as high as 300 mg/m³. Counterirritation by L-menthol was abolished by treatment with a selective inhibitor of Transient Receptor Potential Melastatin 8 (TRPM8), the neuronal cold/menthol receptor. Inclusion of menthol in the cigarette smoke resulted in roughly a 1.5-fold increase in plasma cotinine levels over those observed in mice exposed to smoke without added menthol. These findings document that, L-menthol, through TRPM8, is a strong suppressor of respiratory irritation responses, even during highly noxious exposures to cigarette smoke or smoke irritants, and increases blood cotinine. Therefore, L-menthol, as a cigarette additive, may promote smoking initiation and nicotine addiction."

Its close proximity with the anterior incisors affects one’s ability to place immediate implants in ideal position. Objective To avoid causing complication, variations in their dimensions were studied. Material and Methods Images of ninety Mongoloids patients examined with i-CAT Cone Beam Computed Tomography were included. The sizes of the nasopalatine foramen, the incisive canal and foramen, and anterior maxillary bone thickness were measured. The direction and course of the canals were assessed. Results The mean labiopalatal and mesiodistal measurements of the incisive foramen were 2.80mm and 3.49 mm respectively, while the labiopalatal width of the nasal foramen was 6.06mm. The incisive canal was 16.33mm long and 3.85 mm wide. The anterior maxillary bone has an average thickness of 7.63 mm. The dimensions of the incisive foramen and incisive canal, and anterior maxillary bone thickness demonstrated gender differences with males showing greater values. The anterior maxillary bone thickness was affected by age but this difference was not observed in canal dimensions. The majority of subjects have a funnel shape-like incisive canal with the broader opening located at its superior. They seem to have a longer slanted-curve canal with one channel at its middle portion and a narrower incisive foramen opening than those reported elsewhere. Conclusions This study found that gender is an important factor that affected the characteristics of the IC and the amount of bone anterior to it. Male generally had bigger IC and thicker anterior bone. In addition, the anterior maxillary bone thickness was affected by aging, where it becomes thinner with increased age even though the subjects were fully dentate."
https://openalex.org/W2089345123,"Fragile X Syndrome (FXS), a neurodevelopmental disorder, is the most prevalent single-gene cause of autism spectrum disorder. Autism has been associated with impaired auditory processing, abnormalities in the auditory brainstem response (ABR), and reduced cell number and size in the auditory brainstem nuclei. FXS is characterized by elevated cortical responses to sound stimuli, with some evidence for aberrant ABRs. Here, we assessed ABRs and auditory brainstem anatomy in Fmr1-/- mice, an animal model of FXS. We found that Fmr1-/- mice showed elevated response thresholds to both click and tone stimuli. Amplitudes of ABR responses were reduced in Fmr1-/- mice for early peaks of the ABR. The growth of the peak I response with sound intensity was less steep in mutants that in wild type mice. In contrast, amplitudes and response growth in peaks IV and V did not differ between these groups. We did not observe differences in peak latencies or in interpeak latencies. Cell size was reduced in Fmr1-/- mice in the ventral cochlear nucleus (VCN) and in the medial nucleus of the trapezoid body (MNTB). We quantified levels of inhibitory and excitatory synaptic inputs in these nuclei using markers for presynaptic proteins. We measured VGAT and VGLUT immunolabeling in VCN, MNTB, and the lateral superior olive (LSO). VGAT expression in MNTB was significantly greater in the Fmr1-/- mouse than in wild type mice. Together, these observations demonstrate that FXS affects peripheral and central aspects of hearing and alters the balance of excitation and inhibition in the auditory brainstem."
https://openalex.org/W2094850376,"Prenatal stress causes predisposition to cognitive and emotional disturbances and is a risk factor towards the development of neuropsychiatric conditions like depression, bipolar disorders and schizophrenia. The extracellular protein Reelin, expressed by Cajal-Retzius cells during cortical development, plays critical roles on cortical lamination and synaptic maturation, and its deregulation has been associated with maladaptive conditions. In the present study, we address the effect of prenatal restraint stress (PNS) upon Reelin expression and signaling in pregnant rats during the last 10 days of pregnancy. Animals from one group, including control and PNS exposed fetuses, were sacrificed and analyzed using immunohistochemical, biochemical, cell biology and molecular biology approaches. We scored changes in the expression of Reelin, its signaling pathway and in the methylation of its promoter. A second group included control and PNS exposed animals maintained until young adulthood for behavioral studies. Using the optical dissector, we show decreased numbers of Reelin-positive neurons in cortical layer I of PNS exposed animals. In addition, neurons from PNS exposed animals display decreased Reelin expression that is paralleled by changes in components of the Reelin-signaling cascade, both in vivo and in vitro. Furthermore, PNS induced changes in the DNA methylation levels of the Reelin promoter in culture and in histological samples. PNS adult rats display excessive spontaneous locomotor activity, high anxiety levels and problems of learning and memory consolidation. No significant visuo-spatial memory impairment was detected on the Morris water maze. These results highlight the effects of prenatal stress on the Cajal-Retzius neuronal population, and the persistence of behavioral consequences using this treatment in adults, thereby supporting a relevant role of PNS in the genesis of neuropsychiatric diseases. We also propose an in vitro model that can yield new insights on the molecular mechanisms behind the effects of prenatal stress."

Comparisons of gene-expression between the control and the treatment were conducted after tag-mapping to the sequenced Brassica rapa genome. The differentially expressed genes during the time course of salt stress were focused on, and 163 genes were identified to be differentially expressed at all the time points. Gene Ontology and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes enrichment analyses revealed that some of the genes were involved in proline metabolism, inositol metabolism, carbohydrate metabolic processes and oxidation-reduction processes and may play vital roles in the salt-stress response at the germination stage. Thus, this study provides new candidate salt stress responding genes, which may function in novel putative nodes in the molecular pathways of salt stress resistance."

This enzyme has a three-domain structure consisting of an N-terminal heme b containing a cytochrome domain that is homologous to the cytochrome domain of cellobiose dehydrogenase (CDH; EC 1.1.99.18) from the wood-rotting basidiomycete Phanerochaete chrysosporium, a C-terminal family 1-type carbohydrate-binding module, and a novel central catalytic domain containing PQQ as a cofactor. Here, we describe the biochemical and electrochemical characterization of recombinant CcPDH. UV-vis and resonance Raman spectroscopic studies clearly reveal characteristics of a 6-coordinated low-spin heme b in both the ferric and ferrous states, as well as intramolecular electron transfer from the PQQ to heme b. Moreover, the formal potential of the heme was evaluated to be 130 mV vs. NHE by cyclic voltammetry. These results indicate that the cytochrome domain of CcPDH possesses similar biophysical properties to that in CDH. A comparison of the conformations of monosaccharides as substrates and the associated catalytic efficiency (kcat/Km) of CcPDH indicates that the enzyme prefers monosaccharides with equatorial C-2, C-3 hydroxyl groups and an axial C-4 hydroxyl group in the 1C4 chair conformation. Furthermore, a binding study shows a high binding affinity of CcPDH for cellulose, suggesting that CcPDH function is related to the enzymatic degradation of plant cell wall."

A few prior studies have shown that migraine is associated with atypical cortical brain structure and atypical functional connectivity amongst cortical regions that participate in sensory processing. However, the specific brain regions that most accurately differentiate the migraine brain from the healthy brain have yet to be determined. The aim of this study was to identify the brain regions that comprised interregional cortical thickness correlations that most differed between migraineurs and healthy controls. Methods This was a cross-sectional brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) investigation of 64 adults with migraine and 39 healthy control subjects recruited from tertiary-care medical centers and their surrounding communities. All subjects underwent structural brain MRI imaging on a 3T scanner. Cortical thickness was determined for 70 brain regions that cover the cerebral cortex and cortical thickness correlations amongst these regions were calculated. Cortical thickness correlations that best differentiated groups of six migraineurs from controls and vice versa were identified. Results A model containing 15 interregional cortical thickness correlations differentiated groups of migraineurs from healthy controls with high accuracy. The right temporal pole was involved in 13 of the 15 interregional correlations while the right middle temporal cortex was involved in the other two. Conclusions A model consisting of 15 interregional cortical thickness correlations accurately differentiates the brains of small groups of migraineurs from those of healthy controls. Correlations with the right temporal pole were highly represented in this classifier, suggesting that this region plays an important role in migraine pathophysiology."
https://openalex.org/W2003679092,"Synthetic pesticide use has been the dominant form of pest control since the 1940s. However, biopesticides are emerging as sustainable pest control alternatives, with prevailing use in organic agricultural production systems. Foremost among botanical biopesticides is the limonoid azadirachtin, whose perceived environmental safety has come under debate and scrutiny in recent years. Coconut production, particularly organic coconut production, is one of the agricultural systems in which azadirachtin is used as a primary method of pest control for the management of the invasive coconut mite, Aceria guerreronis Keifer (Acari: Eriophyidae). The management of this mite species also greatly benefits from predation by Neoseiulus baraki (Athias-Henriot) (Acari: Phytoseiidae). Here, we assessed the potential behavioral impacts of azadirachtin on the coconut mite predator, N. baraki. We explored the effects of this biopesticide on overall predator activity, female searching time, and mating behavior and fecundity. Azadirachtin impairs the overall activity of the predator, reducing it to nearly half; however, female searching was not affected. In contrast, mating behavior was compromised by azadirachtin exposure particularly when male predators were exposed to the biopesticide. Consequently, predator fecundity was also compromised by azadirachtin, furthering doubts about its environmental safety and selectivity towards biological control agents."
https://openalex.org/W2089563539,"Phylogenetic profiling is a well-established approach for predicting gene function based on patterns of gene presence and absence across species. Much of the recent developments have focused on methodological improvements, but relatively little is known about the effect of input data size on the quality of predictions. In this work, we ask: how many genomes and functional annotations need to be considered for phylogenetic profiling to be effective? Phylogenetic profiling generally benefits from an increased amount of input data. However, by decomposing this improvement in predictive accuracy in terms of the contribution of additional genomes and of additional annotations, we observed diminishing returns in adding more than ∼100 genomes, whereas increasing the number of annotations remained strongly beneficial throughout. We also observed that maximising phylogenetic diversity within a clade of interest improves predictive accuracy, but the effect is small compared to changes in the number of genomes under comparison. Finally, we show that these findings are supported in light of the Open World Assumption, which posits that functional annotation databases are inherently incomplete. All the tools and data used in this work are available for reuse from http://lab.dessimoz.org/14_phylprof. Scripts used to analyse the data are available on request from the authors."
https://openalex.org/W2058276819,"During asthma development, differentiation of epithelial cells and fibroblasts towards the contractile phenotype is associated with bronchial wall remodeling and airway constriction. Pathological fibroblast-to-myofibroblast transition (FMT) can be triggered by local inflammation of bronchial walls. Recently, we have demonstrated that human bronchial fibroblasts (HBFs) derived from asthmatic patients display some inherent features which facilitate their FMT in vitro. In spite of intensive research efforts, these properties remain unknown. Importantly, the role of undifferentiated HBFs in the asthmatic process was systematically omitted. Specifically, biomechanical properties of undifferentiated HBFs have not been considered in either FMT or airway remodeling in vivo. Here, we combine atomic force spectroscopy with fluorescence microscopy to compare mechanical properties and actin cytoskeleton architecture of HBFs derived from asthmatic patients and non-asthmatic donors. Our results demonstrate that asthmatic HBFs form thick and aligned ‘ventral’ stress fibers accompanied by enlarged focal adhesions. The differences in cytoskeleton architecture between asthmatic and non-asthmatic cells correlate with higher elastic modulus of asthmatic HBFs and their increased predilection to TGF-β-induced FMT. Due to the obvious links between cytoskeleton architecture and mechanical equilibrium, our observations indicate that HBFs derived from asthmatic bronchi can develop considerably higher static tension than non-asthmatic HBFs. This previously unexplored property of asthmatic HBFs may be potentially important for their myofibroblastic differentiation and bronchial wall remodeling during asthma development."

The determination of sex in zebrafish has been suggested to rely on a mechanism that is affected by germ cell-derived signals. To begin our current study, a simplified and efficient germ cell-specific promoter of the dead end (dnd) gene was identified. Utilizing the metrodinazole (MTZ)/ bacterial nitroreductase (NTR) system for inducible germ cell ablation, several stable Tg (dnd:NTR-EGFP(-3'UTR)) and Tg (dnd:NTR-EGFP(+3'UTR)) zebrafish lines were then generated with the identified promoter. A thorough comparison of the expression patterns and tissue distributions of endogenous dnd and ntr-egfp transcripts in vivo revealed that the identified 2032-bp zebrafish dnd promoter can recapitulate dnd expression faithfully in stable transgenic zebrafish. The correlation between the levels of the germ cell-derived signals and requirement for maintaining the female fate has been also explored with different durations of the MTZ treatments. Our results revealed the decreasing ratios of female presented in the treated transgenic group are fairly associated with the reducing levels of the early germ cell-derived signals. After the juvenile transgenic fish treated with 5 mM MTZ for 20 days, all MTZ-treated transgenic fish exclusively developed into males with subfertilities. Taken together, our results identified here a simplified and efficient dnd promoter, and provide clear evidence indicating that it was not the presence but the sufficiency of signals derived from germ cells that is essential for female sex development in zebrafish.

Habitat suitability models are useful in quantifying species-environment relationships and predicting species distribution patterns. Little is known, however, about the stability and performance of habitat suitability models when projected into new areas (spatial transferability) and how this can inform resource management. The aims of this study were to model habitat suitability of Norway lobster (Nephrops norvegicus) in five fished areas of the Northeast Atlantic (Aran ground, Irish Sea, Celtic Sea, Scotland Inshore and Fladen ground), and to test for spatial transferability of habitat models among multiple regions. Nephrops burrow density was modelled using generalised additive models (GAMs) with predictors selected from four environmental variables (depth, slope, sediment and rugosity). Models were evaluated and tested for spatial transferability among areas. The optimum models (lowest AICc) for different areas always included depth and sediment as predictors. Burrow densities were generally greater at depth and in finer sediments, but relationships for individual areas were sometimes more complex. Aside from an inclusion of depth and sediment, the optimum models differed between fished areas. When it came to tests of spatial transferability, however, most of the models were able to predict Nephrops density in other areas. Furthermore, transferability was not dependent on use of the optimum models since competing models were also able to achieve a similar level of transferability to new areas. A degree of decoupling between model ‘fitting’ performance and spatial transferability supports the use of simpler models when extrapolating habitat suitability maps to different areas. Differences in the form and performance of models from different areas may supply further information on the processes shaping species’ distributions. Spatial transferability of habitat models can be used to support fishery management when the information is scarce but caution needs to be applied when making inference and a multi-area transferability analysis is preferable to bilateral comparisons between areas."

In this study, 13 sampling areas were selected from vegetable fields in the outskirts of Xi’an, the largest city in northwestern China. The similarity of PAH composition in soil and vegetation was investigated through principal components analysis and redundancy analysis (RDA), rather than discrimination of PAH congeners from various sources. The toxic equivalent quantity of PAHs in soil ranged from 7 to 202 μg/kg d.w., with an average of 41 μg/kg d.w., which exceeded the agricultural/horticultural soil acceptance criteria for New Zealand. However, the cancer risk level posed by combined direct ingestion, dermal contact, inhalation of soil particles, and inhalation of surface soil vapor met the rigorous international criteria (1×10−6). The concentration of total PAHs was (1052±73) μg/kg d.w. in vegetation (mean±standard error). The cancer risks posed by ingestion of vegetation ranged from 2×10−5 to 2×10−4 with an average of 1.66×10−4, which was higher than international excess lifetime risk limits for carcinogens (1×10−4). The geochemical indices indicated that the PAHs in soil and vegetables were mainly from vehicle and crude oil combustion. Both the total PAHs in vegetation and bioconcentration factor for total PAHs (the ratio of total PAHs in vegetation to total PAHs in soil) increased with increasing pH as well as decreasing sand in soil. The total variation in distribution of PAHs in vegetation explained by those in soil reached 98% in RDA, which was statistically significant based on Monte Carlo permutation. Common pollution source and notable effects of soil contamination on vegetation would result in highly similar distribution of PAHs in soil and vegetation."
https://openalex.org/W2075442777,"Soft bottom macrobenthic communities were studied seasonally in three coastal ponds (Marinello ponds, Italy) at increasing distances from a gull (Larus michahellis) colony to investigate the effect of seabird-induced eutrophication (i.e. guanotrophication) on macrobenthic fauna. We hypothesized that enhanced nutrient concentration and organic load caused by guano input significantly alter the trophic and sedimentological condition of ponds, affecting benthic fauna through a bottom-up control. The influence of a set of environmental features on macrobenthic assemblages was also tested. Overall, the lowest macrobenthic abundances and functional group diversity were found in deeper sites, especially in the pond characterised by severe guanotrophication, where the higher disturbance resulted in a decline in suspension feeders and carnivores in favour of deposit feeders. An increase in opportunistic/tolerant taxa (e.g. chironomid larvae and paraonids) and totally azoic sediments were also found as an effect of the harshest environmental conditions, resulting in a very poor ecological status. We conclude that macrobenthic assemblages of the Marinello coastal system display high spatial variability due to a synergistic effect of trophic status and the geomorphological features of the ponds. The macrobenthic response to guanotrophication, which was a clear decrease in abundance, diversity and trophic functional groups, was associated with the typical response to severe eutrophication, magnified by the geomorphological features."
https://openalex.org/W1980128052,"Targeting antigens to dendritic cells (DCs) by using hybrid monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) directed against DC receptors is known to improve activation and support long-lasting T cell responses. In the present work, we used the mAb αDEC205 fused to the Trypanosoma cruzi amastigote surface protein 2 (ASP-2) to identify a region of this protein recognized by specific T cells. The hybrid αDEC-ASP2 mAb was successfully generated and preserved its ability to bind the DEC205 receptor. Immunization of BALB/c mice with the recombinant mAb in the presence of polyriboinosinic: polyribocytidylic acid (poly (I:C)) specifically enhanced the number of IFN-γ producing cells and CD4+ T cell proliferation when compared to mice immunized with a mAb without receptor affinity or with the non-targeted ASP-2 protein. The strong immune response induced in mice immunized with the hybrid αDEC-ASP2 mAb allowed us to identify an ASP-2-specific CD4+ T cell epitope recognized by the BALB/c MHCII haplotype. We conclude that targeting parasite antigens to DCs is a useful strategy to enhance T cell mediated immune responses facilitating the identification of new T-cell epitopes."
https://openalex.org/W2114706058,"Understanding how invasive plants may alter predator avoidance behaviors is important for granivorous rodents because their foraging can trigger ripple effects in trophic webs. Previous research has shown that European beach grass Ammophila arenaria, an invasive species in coastal California, affects the predation of other seeds by the rodents Microtus californicus, Peromyscus maniculatus, and Reithrodontomys megalotis. This may be due to lower perceived predation risk by rodents foraging in close proximity to the cover provided by Ammophila, but this mechanism has not yet been tested. We examined the perceived predation risk of rodents by measuring the ‘giving up density’ of food left behind in experimental patches of food in areas with and without abundant cover from Ammophila and under varying amount of moonlight. We found strong evidence that giving up density was lower in the thick uniform vegetation on Ammophila-dominated habitat than it was in the more sparsely and diversely vegetated restored habitat. There was also evidence that moonlight affected giving up density and that it mediated the effects of habitat, although with our design we were unable to distinguish the effects of lunar illumination and moon phase. Our findings illustrate that foraging rodents, well known to be risk-averse during moonlit nights, are also affected by the presence of an invasive plant. This result has implications for granivory and perhaps plant demography in invaded and restored coastal habitats. Future research in this system should work to unravel the complex trophic links formed by a non-native invasive plant (i.e., Ammophila) providing cover favored by native rodents, which likely forage on and potentially limit the recruitment of native and non-native plants, some of which have ecosystem consequences of their own."
https://openalex.org/W2108070046,"Literature has suggested that changes in brain flow circulation occur in patients with multiple sclerosis. In this study, digital subtraction angiography (DSA) was used to measure the absolute CCT value in MS patients and to correlate its value to age at disease onset and duration, and to expand disability status scale (EDSS). DSA assessment was performed on eighty MS patients and on a control group of forty-four age-matched patients. CCT in MS and control groups was calculated by analyzing the angiographic images. Lesion and brain volumes were calculated in a representative group of MS patients. Statistical correlations among CCT and disease duration, age at disease onset, lesion load, brain volumes and EDSS were considered. A significant difference between CCT in MS patients (mean = 4.9s; sd = 1.27s) and control group (mean = 2.8s; sd = 0.51s) was demonstrated. No significant statistical correlation was found between CCT and the other parameters in all MS patients. Significantly increased CCT value in MS patients suggests the presence of microvascular dysfunctions, which do not depend on clinical and MRI findings. Hemodynamic changes may not be exclusively the result of a late chronic inflammatory process."

Methods The hospital-based investigation included patients who underwent cataract surgery between March 2014 and April 2014. Using aqueous humour collected at the start of cataract surgery, the interleukins IL-1β, IL-6, IL-8, IL-10 and IL-12p, TNF-α and VEGF were examined using a cytometric bead array. Axial length was determined by partial coherence laser interferometry (IOL Master). Results The study included 33 patients with cataract (33 eyes) with a mean age of 69.2±10.8 years (range:50–87 years) and a mean axial length of 24.7±1.9 mm (range:22.6–31.5 mm). Lower aqueous concentration of VEGF was significantly associated with longer axial length (VEGF concentration (pg/mL) = -5.12 x Axial Length (mm) + 163; correlation coefficient r = -0.41; P<0.001) and more myopic refractive error (VEGF concentration (pg/mL) = 1.27xspherical equivalent (diopters)+44.8; r = 0.383; P = 0.002). The aqueous concentrations of all other substances were not significantly (all P>0.10) associated with axial length or refractive error. Conclusions Higher intravitreal concentrations of VEGF were measured in eyes with a longer axial length, while the intraocular concentrations of IL-1β, IL-6, IL-8, IL-10, IL-12p and TNF-α were not correlated with axial length. The lower concentration of VEGF in axially elongated eyes may be one of the reasons for the lower prevalence of age-related macular degeneration and diabetic retinopathy in myopic eyes."
https://openalex.org/W1980124732,"The common differential diagnosis of microcytic anemia in young Asian men includes iron deficiency anemia (IDA), α-thalassemia (αT) and β-thalassemia (βT). In this study, we aimed to distinguish between these diseases in a distinct population of young men using a specific index.We retrospectively reviewed the laboratory data of young men with microcytic anemia. The clinical, characteristic and laboratory data, including complete blood cell counts, serum ferritin and hemoglobin electrophoresis results, were collected; genomic DNA mutations were also evaluated. Based on these data, ten discrimination indices were used to differentiate thalassemia from IDA. The sensitivity, specificity, positive and negative predictive values, Youden's index and receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves were also calculated.A total of 877 patients (92 patients with IDA, 332 with αT and 453 with βT) were enrolled; the Shine and Lal (S&L) formula was the best method with which to discriminate IDA from thalassemia (100% sensitivity, 91% specificity). The new cut-off values were evaluated, and the approaches used in our study cohort, particularly the Green & King (G&K) formula, significantly increased the accuracies of red cell distribution width-containing indices (cut-off value: 58.66; 89.62% sensitivity and 96.2% specificity; AUC: 0.9716). In addition, when applied properly, these indices could differentiate IDA patients from αT patients, especially Huber-Herklotz index (HH).The sensitivity and specificity differed among ethnic and age groups. We concluded that when using the original cut-off value, the S&L formula was the best discriminating index for differentiating between IDA and thalassemia in young Asian men. However, when using the G&K formula, the newly obtained cut-off value must be applied to increase accuracy based on the results from our cohort."
https://openalex.org/W1986817721,"The ability to control infections is a key trait for migrants that must be balanced against other costly features of the migratory life. In this study we explored the links between migration and disease ecology by examining natural variation in parasite exposure and immunity in several populations of Lesser Black-backed Gulls (Larus fuscus) with different migratory strategies. We found higher activity of natural antibodies in long distance migrants from the nominate subspecies L.f.fuscus. Circulating levels of IgY showed large variation at the population level, while immune parameters associated with antimicrobial activity showed extensive variation at the individual level irrespective of population or migratory strategy. Pathogen prevalence showed large geographical variation. However, the seroprevalence of one of the gull-specific subtypes of avian influenza (H16) was associated to the migratory strategy, with lower prevalence among the long-distance migrants, suggesting that migration may play a role in disease dynamics of certain pathogens at the population level."
https://openalex.org/W2070574237,"Pancreatic cancer has been increasing in importance in Shanghai over the last four decades. The etiology of the disease is still unclear. Evidence suggests that the COX-2 pathway, an important component of inflammation, may be involved in the disease. We aimed to evaluate the association between urinary prostaglandin E2 metabolite (PGE-M) level and risk of pancreatic cancer. From a recent population-based case-control study in Shanghai, 200 pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma cases and 200 gender- and age- frequency matched controls were selected for the present analysis. Urinary PGE-M was measured with a liquid chromatography/mass spectrometric assay. Adjusted unconditional logistic regression was used to estimate odds ratios (ORs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs). A positive association was observed between PGE-M leve and pancreatic cancer risk: OR = 1.63 (95% CI 1.01–2.63) for the third tertile compared to the first. Though the interactions were not statistically significant, the associations tended to be stronger among subjects with diabetes history (OR = 3.32; 95% CI 1.20–9.19) and higher meat intake (OR = 2.12; 95% CI 1.10–4.06). The result suggests that higher urinary PGE-M level may be associated with increased risk of pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma."
https://openalex.org/W2020507006,"Background Metabolic syndrome (MetS) and obesity are risk factors for cardiovascular disease, however, it remains unclear about effects of MetS with or without obesity on perioperative and long-term morbidity and mortality after coronary artery bypass graft (CABG). Methods An observational cohort study was performed on 4,916 consecutive patients receiving isolated primary CABG in Fuwai hospital. Of all patients, 1238 patients met the inclusion criteria and were divided into three groups: control, MetS with obesity and MetS without obesity (n = 868, 76 and 294 respectively). The patient’s 5-year survival and major adverse cerebral and cardiovascular events (MACCE) were studied. Results Among all three groups, there were no significant differences in in-hospital postoperative complications, epinephrine use, stroke, ICU stay, ventilation time, atrial fibrillation, renal failure, coma, myocardial infarction, repeated revascularization, and long-term stroke. The patients in MetS without obesity group were not associated with increased perioperative or long-term morbidities and mortality. In contrast, the patients in MetS with obesity group were associated with significant increased perioperative complications including MACCE (30.26% vs. 20.75%, 16.7%, p = 0.0074) and mortality (11.84% vs. 3.74%, 3.11%, p = 0.0007) respectively. Patients in MetS with obesity group was associated with significantly increased long-term of MACCE (adjusted OR:2.040; 95%CI:1.196–3.481; P＜0.05) and 5-years of mortality (adjusted HR:4.659; 95%CI:1.966–11.042; P＜0.05). Conclusions Patients with metabolic syndrome and obesity are associated with significant increased perioperative and long-term complications and mortality, while metabolic syndrome without obesity do not worsen outcomes after CABG."
https://openalex.org/W2042388763,"The combination of radiotherapy treatments and breast reconstruction, using temporary tissue expanders, generates several concerns due to the presence of a magnetic valve inside the radiation field. The objective of this work is to evaluate a radiotherapy treatment planning for a patient using a tissue expander. Isodose curve maps, obtained using radiochromic films, were compared to the ones calculated with two different dose calculation algorithms of the Eclipse radiotherapy Treatment Planning System (TPS), considering the presence or absence of the heterogeneity. The TPS calculation considering the presence of the heterogeneity shows changes around 5% in the isodose curves when they were compared with the calculation without heterogeneity correction. This calculation did not take in account the real density value of the heterogeneity. This limitation was quantified to be around 10% in comparison with the TPS calculation and experimental measurements using the radiochromic film. These results show that the magnetic valve should be taken in account in dose calculations of the TPS. With respect to the AAA and Pencil Beam Convolution algorithms, when the calculation is compared with the real distribution, AAA presents a distribution more similar to experimental dose distribution."
https://openalex.org/W1974589190,"α-synuclein (α-syn) is a major component of the intracellular inclusions called Lewy bodies, which are a key pathological feature in the brains of Parkinson’s disease patients. The neurotransmitter dopamine (DA) inhibits the fibrillisation of α-syn into amyloid, and promotes α-syn aggregation into SDS-stable soluble oligomers. While this inhibition of amyloid formation requires the oxidation of both DA and the methionines in α-syn, the molecular basis for these processes is still unclear. This study sought to define the protein sequences required for the generation of oligomers. We tested N- (α-syn residues 43–140) and C-terminally (1–95) truncated α-syn, and found that similar to full-length protein both truncated species formed soluble DA:α-syn oligomers, albeit 1–95 had a different profile. Using nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR), and the N-terminally truncated α-syn 43–140 protein, we analysed the structural characteristics of the DA:α-syn 43–140 dimer and α-syn 43–140 monomer and found the dimerisation interface encompassed residues 43 to 60. Narrowing the interface to this small region will help define the mechanism by which DA mediates the formation of SDS-stable soluble DA:α-syn oligomers."
https://openalex.org/W1989046204,"Objective To evaluate whether the genetic susceptibility of T2D was associated with overall survival (OS) and disease-free survival (DFS) outcomes for breast cancer (BC). Methods Included in the study were 6346 BC patients who participated in three population-based epidemiological studies of BC and were genotyped with either GWAS or Exome-chip. We constructed a genetic risk score (GRS) for diabetes using risk variants identified from the GWAS catalog (http://genome.gov/gwastudies) that were associated with T2D risk at a minimum significance level of P ≤ 5.0E-8 among Asian population and evaluated its associations with BC outcomes with Cox proportional hazards models. Results During a median follow-up of 8.08 years (range, 0.01–16.95 years), 1208 deaths were documented in 6346 BC patients. Overall, the diabetes GRS was not associated with OS and DFS. Analyses stratified by estrogen receptor status (ER) showed that the diabetes GRS was inversely associated with OS among women with ER- but not in women with ER+ breast cancer; the multivariable adjusted HR was 1.38 (95% CI: 1.05–1.82) when comparing the highest to the lowest GRS quartiles. The association of diabetes GRS with OS varied by diabetes status (P for interaction <0.01). In women with history of diabetes, higher diabetes GRS was significantly associated with worse OS, with HR of 2.22 (95% CI: 1.28–3.88) for the highest vs. lowest quartile, particularly among women with an ER- breast cancer, with corresponding HR being 4.59 (95% CI: 1.04–20.28). No significant association between the diabetes GRS and OS was observed across different BMI and PR groups. Conclusions Our study suggested that genetic susceptibility of T2D was positively associated with total mortality among women with ER- breast cancer, particularly among subjects with a history of diabetes. Additional studies are warranted to verify the associations and elucidate the underlying biological mechanism."
https://openalex.org/W1992067904,"Objective For the treatment of obesity, both conservative and surgical procedures are available. Psychological factors are likely to influence the choice of treatment; however, to date, systematic studies that investigate these factors are few in number. The aim of our study was to analyze whether patients who undergo a surgical treatment differ from those who require a conservative treatment in regard to psychological factors, regardless of their somatic conditions. Furthermore, predictors of treatment choice will be examined. Methods A total of 244 patients (189 women), with a mean body mass index of 45.1 kg/m2, underwent a weight reduction treatment, with 126 patients undergoing bariatric surgery and 118 patients participating in a conservative, multimodal outpatient weight reduction program. Differences in the results of the psychological questionnaires between conservatively and surgically treated patients were evaluated through the use of t-tests, χ2-tests and an ANCOVA. For the analysis of the predictors, logistic regression models were calculated. Results Surgically and conservatively treated obese patients differ in psychological, somatic, and socio-demographic factors. The psychological differences between the groups are independent of obesity-related co-morbidities, such as body mass index (BMI), type 2 diabetes mellitus, hypertension and coronary heart disease. The following psychological and somatic factors equally predict the choice of bariatric surgery: apathy, delegated active coping, a sense of coherence, complaints, type 2 diabetes mellitus, BMI, and age. Conclusion Longitudinal studies are required to assess the predictive value of the psychological factors in regard to the postsurgical weight course to improve the pre-surgical screening and treatment selection process. The pre-surgical identification of psychological predictors should result in a more personalized medicine course and may ensure long term outcomes."
https://openalex.org/W2083918330,"Background In India, despite well-established anti-retroviral treatment programs, Cytomegalovirus (CMV) infection-related end-organ diseases (EODs) still remain a major concern resulting in exacerbation of morbidity and mortality among HIV/AIDS patients. A prospective study was designed to understand the distribution and prognosis of CMV associated EODs and to determine a standardized cut-off value for serum CMV viral load associated with the development of EODs amongst HIV/AIDS subjects. Methods In a cohort of 400 late-diagnosed HAART naïve HIV/AIDS subjects attending anti-retroviral centers of Kolkata during 2008–2014, the median duration of follow-up was 560 days, and at least 3 visits subsequent to the baseline were mandatory for eligibility. HIV-1 and CMV viral load were estimated by performing Real-Time Polymerase Chain Reactions (PCR). Results Among subjects, 40.5% (162/400) had CMV EODs which were more common at lower CD4 counts. Poor prognosis and higher death rate were associated with a low CD4 count and increased HIV-1 and CMV viral loads. Subjects having higher CD4 count responded better to therapy [for CD4 = 60–100: Risk Ratio:RR = 1.48 (95% Confidence Interval: 95%CI = 1.18–1.82) and for CD4 = 30–59: RR = 1.64 (95%CI = 1.18–2.27)]. The cut off value of the serum CMV viral load (expressed as log10DNA/ml serum) associated with the development of EODs and disseminated CMV EODs was determined as 5.4 (p<0.0001) and 6.4 (p<0.0001) respectively. These cut offs were found to have satisfactorily high sensitivity, specificity, positive and negative predictive values. Conclusion Prognosis of CMV EOD was poor as indicated by higher death rates among subjects with lower CD4 count, and specific cut-off values were found to have useful potential for identification and treatment of CMV infected HIV/AIDS patients in due time to avoid CMV EODs among HIV/AIDS subjects. Targeted intervention programs seemed to be required urgently to make these cut-offs operational in order to minimize the burden of CMV EOD in this vulnerable population."
https://openalex.org/W2027868853,"Objective The endothelium is a key mediator of vascular homeostasis and cardiovascular health. Molecular research on the human endothelium may provide insight into the mechanisms underlying cardiovascular disease. Prior methodology used to isolate human endothelial cells has suffered from poor yields and contamination with other cell types. We thus sought to develop a minimally invasive technique to obtain endothelial cells derived from human subjects with higher yields and purity. Methods Nine healthy volunteers underwent endothelial cell harvesting from antecubital veins using guidewires. Fluorescence-activated cell sorting (FACS) was subsequently used to purify endothelial cells from contaminating cells using endothelial surface markers (CD34 / CD105 / CD146) with the concomitant absence of leukocyte and platelet specific markers (CD11b / CD45). Endothelial lineage in the purified cell population was confirmed by expression of endothelial specific genes and microRNA using quantitative polymerase chain reaction (PCR). Results A median of 4,212 (IQR: 2161 – 6583) endothelial cells were isolated from each subject. Quantitative PCR demonstrated higher expression of von Willebrand Factor (vWF, P<0.001), nitric oxide synthase 3 (NOS3, P<0.001) and vascular cell adhesion molecule 1 (VCAM-1, P<0.003) in the endothelial population compared to similarly isolated leukocytes. Similarly, the level of endothelial specific microRNA-126 was higher in the purified endothelial cells (P<0.001). Conclusion This state-of-the-art technique isolates human endothelial cells for molecular analysis in higher purity and greater numbers than previously possible. This approach will expedite research on the molecular mechanisms of human cardiovascular disease, elucidating its pathophysiology and potential therapeutic targets."
https://openalex.org/W1989939328,"Deception is an impactful social event that has been the focus of an abundance of researches over recent decades. In this paper, an electroencephalography (EEG) study is presented regarding the cognitive processes of an instructed liar/truth-teller during the time window of stimulus (question) delivery period (SDP) prior to their deceptive/truthful responses towards questions related to authentic (WE: with prior experience) and fictional experience (NE: no prior experience). To investigate deception in non-experienced events, the subjects were given stimuli in a mock interview scenario that induced them to fabricate lies. To analyze the data, frequency domain network and connectivity analysis was performed in the source space in order to provide a more systematic level understanding of deception during SDP. This study reveals several groups of neuronal generators underlying both the instructed lying (IL) and the instructed truth-telling (IT) conditions for both tasks during the SDP. Despite the similarities existed in these group components, significant differences were found in the intra- and inter-group connectivity between the IL and IT conditions in either task. Additionally, the response time was found to be positively correlated with the clustering coefficient of the inferior frontal gyrus (44R) in the WE-IL condition and positively correlated with the clustering coefficient of the precuneus (7L) and the angular gyrus (39R) in the WE-IT condition. However, the response time was found to be marginally negatively correlated with the clustering coefficient of the secondary auditory cortex (42L) in the NE-IL condition and negatively correlated with the clustering coefficient of the somatosensory association cortex (5L, R) in the NE-IT condition. Therefore, these results provide complementary and intuitive evidence for the differences between the IL and IT conditions in SDP for two types of deception tasks, thus elucidating the electrophysiological mechanisms underlying SDP of deception from regional, inter-regional, network, and inter-network scale analyses."
https://openalex.org/W2007728784,"Objective Pancreatic-derived factor (PANDER, also named as FAM3B) is secreted by pancreatic α and β cells. Increasing evidence suggests that it may serve a hormonal function related to glycemic and lipid metabolism. In this study, we investigated the effects of PANDER overexpression on hepatic and adipose triglyceride metabolism in high-fat diet-fed male C57BL/6 mice. Methods PANDER overexpression was achieved by tail-vein injection of recombinant Ad-PANDER and Ad-GFP injected mice served as a control. The TG metabolism in both groups were compared. Results Adenoviral-mediated overexpression of PANDER did not affect body weight, food consumption, or liver enzymes. The triglyceride (TG) content of both liver and adipose tissue was significantly decreased in Ad-PANDER mice (liver: 6.16±1.89 mg/g vs. control 14.95±2.27 mg/g, P<0.05; adipose: 39.31±1.99 mg/100mg vs. 47.22±2.21 mg/100mg, P<0.05). The free fatty acid (FFA) content of adipose tissue in Ad-PANDER mice was also decreased (1.38±0.18 mg/g vs. 2.77±0.31 mg/g, P<0.01). The investigation of key enzymes of triglyceride hydrolysis and FFA oxidation in liver and adipose tissue showed that p-HSL/HSL was significantly increased and that DGAT1 gene and protein expression were significantly reduced in the liver of PANDER-overexpressing mice. PKA phosphorylation was also significantly increased in the livers of Ad-PANDER mice. No differences in ATGL, CPT1, ACOX1, or DGAT2 expression were observed. Conclusion Overexpression of PANDER is associated with observable decreases in TG, increases in PKA phosphorylation, and decreased DGAT1 expression, suggesting a possible interrelationship. The mechanisms by which this occurs remain to be elucidated."
https://openalex.org/W1995228704,"RNA sequencing (RNA-Seq) technology provides the detailed transcriptomic information for a biological sample. Using the RNA-Seq data of six organs from nine vertebrate species, we identified a number of organ-specifically expressed or repressed orthologous genes whose expression patterns are mostly conserved across nine species. Our analyses show the following results: (i) About 80% of these genes have a chordate or more ancient origin and more than half of them are the legacy of one or multiple rounds of large-scale gene duplication events. (ii) Their evolutionary rates are shaped by the organ in which they are expressed or repressed, e.g. the genes specially expressed in testis and liver generally evolve more than twice as fast as the ones specially expressed in brain and cerebellum. The organ-specific transcription factors were discriminated from these genes. The ChIP-seq data from the ENCODE project also revealed the transcription-related factors that might be involved in regulating human organ-specifically expressed or repressed genes. Some of them are shared by all six human organs. The comparison of ENCODE data with mouse/chicken ChIP-seq data proposes that organ-specifically expressed or repressed orthologous genes are regulated in various combinatorial fashions in different species, although their expression features are conserved among these species. We found that the duplication events in some gene families might help explain the quick organ/tissue divergence in vertebrate lineage. The phylogenetic analysis of testis-specifically expressed genes suggests that some of them are prone to develop new functions for other organs/tissues."
https://openalex.org/W2024384142,"Despite implementation of the biological passport to detect erythropoietin abuse, a need for additional biomarkers remains. We used a proteomic approach to identify novel serum biomarkers of prolonged erythropoiesis-stimulating agent (ESA) exposure (Darbepoietin-α) and/or aerobic training.Thirty-six healthy young males were randomly assigned to the following groups: Sedentary-placebo (n = 9), Sedentary-ESA (n = 9), Training-placebo (n = 10), or Training-ESA (n = 8). They were treated with placebo/Darbepoietin-α subcutaneously once/week for 10 weeks followed by a 3-week washout period. Training consisted of supervised biking 3/week for 13 weeks at the highest possible intensity. Serum was collected at baseline, week 3 (high dose Darbepoietin-α), week 10 (reduced dose Darbepoietin-α), and after a 3-week washout period.Serum proteins were separated according to charge and molecular mass (2D-gel electrophoresis). The identity of proteins from spots exhibiting altered intensity was determined by mass spectrometry.Six protein spots changed in response to Darbepoietin-α treatment. Comparing all 4 experimental groups, two protein spots (serotransferrin and haptoglobin/haptoglobin related protein) showed a significant response to Darbepoietin-α treatment. The haptoglobin/haptoglobin related protein spot showed a significantly lower intensity in all subjects in the training-ESA group during the treatment period and increased during the washout period.An isoform of haptoglobin/haptoglobin related protein could be a new anti-doping marker and merits further research.ClinicalTrials.gov NCT01320449."
https://openalex.org/W2075377332,"To determine the interocular retinal nerve fiber layer (RNFL) thickness difference of normal subjects.Both eyes of 230 normal adults received peripapillary RNFL thickness measurements using OCT. The effect of ocular cyclotorsion on the RNFL thickness profile was mathematically corrected. The fractional and absolute interocular RNFL thickness differences at 256 points of peripapillary area were calculated. We divided the subjects into 3 groups according to the locations of superior and inferior peak thickness, respectively, and compared the interocular RNFL thickness differences between the subgroups.The fractional interocular RNFL thickness difference exhibited smaller regional variations than the absolute interocular difference. The means of fractional interocular differences were 0.100 ± 0.077 in the temporal half area and 0.146 ± 0.105 in the nasal half area, and the tolerance limits for the 95th and 99 th distributions were about 0.246 and 0.344 in the temporal half area and 0.293 and 0.408 in the nasal half area, respectively. The fractional interocular differences of subgroups classified by the locations of superior and inferior peak RNFL thickness showed difference at smaller areas than the absolute interocular differences (19 and 8 points versus 49 and 23 points, respectively).Glaucoma can be strongly suspected, if interocular fractional RNFL thickness difference is over 25% at 5 consecutive points or over 35% at 3 consecutive points in the temporal half area. The fractional interocular comparison is a better diagnostic approach because the fractional interocular RNFL thickness difference is less influenced by the locations of peak RNFL thickness."
https://openalex.org/W2121528320,"The behavior of rope-guided conveyances is so complicated that the rope-guided hoisting system hasn’t been understood thoroughly so far. In this paper, with user-defined functions loaded, ANSYS FLUENT 14.5 was employed to simulate lateral motion of rope-guided conveyances in two typical kinds of shaft layouts. With rope-guided mine elevator and mine cages taken into account, results show that the lateral aerodynamic buffeting force is much larger than the Coriolis force, and the side aerodynamic force have the same order of magnitude as the Coriolis force. The lateral aerodynamic buffeting forces should also be considered especially when the conveyance moves along the ventilation air direction. The simulation shows that the closer size of the conveyances can weaken the transverse aerodynamic buffeting effect."
https://openalex.org/W2004674833,"Researchers have recently paid attention to social contact patterns among individuals due to their useful applications in such areas as epidemic evaluation and control, public health decisions, chronic disease research and social network research. Although some studies have estimated social contact patterns from social networks and surveys, few have considered how to infer the hierarchical structure of social contacts directly from census data. In this paper, we focus on inferring an individual’s social contact patterns from detailed census data, and generate various types of social contact patterns such as hierarchical-district-structure-based, cross-district and age-district-based patterns. We evaluate newly generated contact patterns derived from detailed 2011 Hong Kong census data by incorporating them into a model and simulation of the 2009 Hong Kong H1N1 epidemic. We then compare the newly generated social contact patterns with the mixing patterns that are often used in the literature, and draw the following conclusions. First, the generation of social contact patterns based on a hierarchical district structure allows for simulations at different district levels. Second, the newly generated social contact patterns reflect individuals social contacts. Third, the newly generated social contact patterns improve the accuracy of the SEIR-based epidemic model."
https://openalex.org/W2031398084,"The anion exchanger (AE) plays critical roles in physiological processes including CO2 transport and volume regulation in erythrocytes and acid-base regulation in renal tubules. Although expression of the AE in inner-ear hair cells was reported, its specific localization and function are still unclear. Using in situ hybridization, we found that the AE1b transcript is expressed in lateral-line hair cells of zebrafish larvae. An immunohistochemical analysis with a zebrafish-specific antibody localized AE1b to stereocilia of hair cells, and the expression was eliminated by morpholino knockdown of AE1b. A non-invasive, scanning ion-selective electrode technique was applied to analyze mechanotransducer (MET) channel-mediated Ca2+ influx at stereocilia of hair cells of intact fish. Ca2+ influx was effectively suppressed by AE1b morpholino knockdown and inhibitor (DIDS) treatment. Elevating external Ca2+ (0.2 to 2 mM) neutralized the inhibition of DIDS. Taken together, this study provides solid evidence to show that AE1b in stereocilia is required for the proper functioning of MET channels."
