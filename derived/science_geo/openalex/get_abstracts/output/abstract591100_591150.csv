Nevertheless, little is known about the prevalence of loneliness in different age groups in Switzerland. Furthermore, the existing evidence about age and gender as potential effect modifiers of the associations between loneliness, physical and mental health and lifestyle characteristics warrants further investigation. Thus, the aim of the study was to examine the prevalence of loneliness among adults in Switzerland and to assess the associations of loneliness with several physical and mental health and behavioral factors, as well as to assess the modifying effect of sex and age. Methods Data from 20,007 participants of the cross-sectional population-based Swiss Health Survey 2012 (SHS) were analyzed. Logistic regression analyses were used to assess associations of loneliness with physical and mental health or lifestyle characteristics (e.g. diabetes, depression, physical activity). Wald tests were used to test for interactions. Results Loneliness was distributed in a slight U-shaped form from 15 to 75+ year olds, with 64.1% of participants who had never felt lonely. Lonely individuals were more often affected by physical and mental health problems, such as self-reported chronic diseases (Odds ratio [OR] 1.41, 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.30–1.54), high cholesterol levels (OR 1.31, 95% CI 1.18–1.45), diabetes (OR 1.40, 95% CI 1.16–1.67), moderate and high psychological distress (OR 3.74, 95% CI 3.37–4.16), depression (OR 2.78, 95% CI 2.22–3.48) and impaired self-perceived health (OR 1.94, 95% CI 1.74–2.16). Loneliness was significantly associated with most lifestyle factors (e.g. smoking; OR 1.13, 95% 1.05–1.23). Age, but not sex, moderated loneliness’ association with several variables. Conclusion Loneliness is associated with poorer physical and mental health and unhealthy lifestyle, modified by age, but not by sex. Our findings illustrate the importance of considering loneliness for physical and mental health and lifestyle factors, not only in older and younger, but also in middle-aged adults. Longitudinal studies are needed in Switzerland to elucidate the causal relationships of these associations."

We have compared the diagnostic capability of CCM against a range of established measures of nerve damage in patients with diabetic neuropathy.In this cross sectional study, thirty subjects with Type 1 diabetes without neuropathy (T1DM), thirty one T1DM subjects with neuropathy (DSPN) and twenty seven non-diabetic healthy control subjects underwent detailed assessment of neuropathic symptoms and neurologic deficits, quantitative sensory testing (QST), electrophysiology, skin biopsy and corneal confocal microscopy (CCM).Subjects with DSPN were older (C vs T1DM vs DSPN: 41.0±14.9 vs 38.8±12.5 vs 53.3±11.9, P = 0.0002), had a longer duration of diabetes (P<0.0001), lower eGFR (P = 0.006) and higher albumin-creatinine ratio (P = 0.03) with no significant difference for HbA1c, BMI, lipids and blood pressure. Patients with DSPN were representative of subjects with diabetic neuropathy with clinical signs and symptoms of neuropathy and greater neuropathy deficits quantified by QST, electrophysiology, intra-epidermal nerve fibre density and CCM. Corneal nerve fibre density (CNFD) (Spearman's Rho = 0.60 P<0.0001) and IENFD (Spearman's Rho = 0.56 P<0.0001) were comparable when correlated with peroneal nerve conduction velocity. For the diagnosis of diabetic neuropathy the sensitivity for CNFD was 0.77 and specificity was 0.79 with an area under the ROC curve of 0.81. IENFD had a diagnostic sensitivity of 0.61, specificity of 0.80 and area under the ROC curve of 0.73.CCM is a valid accurate non-invasive method to identify small nerve fibre pathology and is able to diagnose DPN."
https://openalex.org/W2736085475,"Carboxylic acid reductase (CAR) catalyzes the ATP- and NADPH-dependent reduction of carboxylic acids to the corresponding aldehydes. The enzyme is related to the nonribosomal peptide synthetases, consisting of an adenylation domain fused via a peptidyl carrier protein (PCP) to a reductase termination domain. Crystal structures of the CAR adenylation-PCP didomain demonstrate that large-scale domain motions occur between the adenylation and thiolation states. Crystal structures of the PCP-reductase didomain reveal that phosphopantetheine binding alters the orientation of a key Asp, resulting in a productive orientation of the bound nicotinamide. This ensures that further reduction of the aldehyde product does not occur. Combining crystallography with small-angle X-ray scattering (SAXS), we propose that molecular interactions between initiation and termination domains are limited to competing PCP docking sites. This theory is supported by the fact that (R)-pantetheine can support CAR activity for mixtures of the isolated domains. Our model suggests directions for further development of CAR as a biocatalyst."

However, we found that the Bacillus cereus fluoride riboswitch aptamer adopts identical tertiary structures in solution with and without ligand. Using chemical-exchange saturation transfer (CEST) NMR spectroscopy, we revealed that the structured ligand-free aptamer transiently accesses a low-populated (∼1%) and short-lived (∼3 ms) excited conformational state that unravels a conserved 'linchpin' base pair to signal transcription termination. Upon fluoride binding, this highly localized, fleeting process is allosterically suppressed, which activates transcription. We demonstrated that this mechanism confers effective fluoride-dependent gene activation over a wide range of transcription rates, which is essential for robust toxicity responses across diverse cellular conditions. These results unveil a novel switching mechanism that employs ligand-dependent suppression of an aptamer excited state to coordinate regulatory conformational transitions rather than adopting distinct aptamer ground-state tertiary architectures, exemplifying a new mode of ligand-dependent RNA regulation."
https://openalex.org/W2734730294,"Growing evidence points out that the capacity of organisms to acclimate or adapt to new habitat conditions basically depends on their phenomic plasticity attributes, of which their gut commensal microbiota might be an essential impact factor. Especially in aquatic organisms, which are in direct and continual contact with the aquatic environment, the complex and dynamic microbiota have significant effects on health and development. However, an understanding of the relative contribution of internal sorting (host genetic) and colonization (environmental) processes is still unclear. To understand how microbial communities differ in response to rapid environmental change, we surveyed and studied the environmental and gut microbiota of native and habitat-exchanged shrimp (Macrobrachium nipponense) using 16S rRNA amplicon sequencing on the Illumina MiSeq platform. Corresponding with microbial diversity of their living water areas, the divergence in gut microbes of lake-to-river shrimp (CK) increased, while that of river-to-lake shrimp (KC) decreased. Importantly, among the candidate environment specific gut microbes in habitat-exchanged shrimp, over half of reads were associated with the indigenous bacteria in native shrimp gut, yet more candidates presented in CK may reflect the complexity of new environment. Our results suggest that shrimp gut microbiota has high plasticity when its host faces environmental changes, even over short timescales. Further, the changes in external environment might influence the gut microbiome not just by providing environment-associated microbes directly, but also by interfering with the composition of indigenous gut bacteria indirectly."
https://openalex.org/W2735341248,"Faithful DNA replication is essential for genome stability. To ensure accurate replication, numerous complex and redundant replication and repair mechanisms function in tandem with the core replication proteins to ensure DNA replication continues even when replication challenges are present that could impede progression of the replication fork. A unique topological challenge to the replication machinery is posed by RNA–DNA hybrids, commonly referred to as R-loops. Although R-loops play important roles in gene expression and recombination at immunoglobulin sites, their persistence is thought to interfere with DNA replication by slowing or impeding replication fork progression. Therefore, it is of interest to identify DNA-associated enzymes that help resolve replication-impeding R-loops. Here, using DNA fiber analysis, we demonstrate that human ribonuclease H1 (RNH1) plays an important role in replication fork movement in the mammalian nucleus by resolving R-loops. We found that RNH1 depletion results in accumulation of RNA–DNA hybrids, slowing of replication forks, and increased DNA damage. Our data uncovered a role for RNH1 in global DNA replication in the mammalian nucleus. Because accumulation of RNA–DNA hybrids is linked to various human cancers and neurodegenerative disorders, our study raises the possibility that replication fork progression might be impeded, adding to increased genomic instability and contributing to disease.

Because accumulation of RNA–DNA hybrids is linked to various human cancers and neurodegenerative disorders, our study raises the possibility that replication fork progression might be impeded, adding to increased genomic instability and contributing to disease. High-fidelity DNA replication is paramount to the maintenance of genome stability. Therefore, cells have evolved various redundant mechanisms to resolve genotoxic challenges including the presence of topological structures. If not resolved, these structures can impede replication fork progression, leading to the stalling and eventual collapse of replication forks (1O'Driscoll M. The pathological consequences of impaired genome integrity in humans; disorders of the DNA replication machinery.J. Pathol. 2017; 241: 192-207Crossref PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar). One such structure is the RNA–DNA hybrid, commonly referred to as an R-loop. Mapping studies have revealed that RNA–DNA hybrid structures are present throughout the genome more frequently than previously appreciated (2Ginno P.A. Lim Y.W. Lott P.L. Korf I. Chédin F.

Quantitative model of R-loop forming structures reveals a novel level of RNA-DNA interactome complexity.Nucleic Acids Res. 2012; 40: e16Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). One source of R-loops is transcription during which nascent RNA emanating from RNA polymerase II hybridizes with its template DNA (4Santos-Pereira J.M. Aguilera A. R loops: new modulators of genome dynamics and function.Nat. Rev. Genet. 2015; 16: 583-597Crossref PubMed Scopus (442) Google Scholar). Although these topological structures play a vital role in a number of key processes including class switch recombination of immunoglobulin genes and transcription termination, their persistence or unscheduled formation and stabilization pose a significant challenge to genome integrity (5Yu K. Chedin F. Hsieh C.-L. Wilson T.E. Lieber M.R. R-loops at immunoglobulin class switch regions in the chromosomes of stimulated B cells.Nat.

Because DNA replication and transcription occur simultaneously at many regions of the genome, hybrids can form in front of the replication machinery and affect its progression. Indeed, these R-loops can lead to increased DNA mutations, unwanted recombination, and gross chromosomal aberrations (7Aguilera A. García-Muse T. R loops: from transcription byproducts to threats to genome stability.Mol. Cell. 2012; 46: 115-124Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (640) Google Scholar). Thus, it is not surprising that a number of proteins inhibit the formation of these structures or resolve them once they have formed (4Santos-Pereira J.M. Aguilera A. R loops: new modulators of genome dynamics and function.Nat. Rev. Genet. 2015; 16: 583-597Crossref PubMed Scopus (442) Google Scholar). Topoisomerase I, mRNA export, and splicing factors, for example, play an active role in preventing R-loop formation (4Santos-Pereira J.M. Aguilera A.

In addition, DNA damage response factors such as breast cancer susceptibility factors (BRCA1 and BRCA2) are also implicated in preventing R-loop accumulation and the ensuing DNA damage (10Bhatia V.

Ribonuclease H1 (RNH1) is a specialized enzyme that can specifically resolve long RNA–DNA hybrids. A closely related protein complex, ribonuclease H2 (RNH2), is adept at removing single misincorporated ribonucleotides from DNA and is critical for ongoing genomic stability (12Reijns M.A. Rabe B.

In yeast, RNH1 and RNH2 function redundantly to facilitate efficient double strand break repair during homologous recombination by assisting in the unwinding of DNA strands and replication protein A binding (13Ohle C. Tesorero R. Schermann G. Dobrev N. Sinning I. Fischer T.

Ectopic expression of RNH1 in yeast is sufficient to minimize transcription-dependent hyper-recombination, pausing of the replication fork, and hydroxyurea sensitivity (14Huertas P. Aguilera A.

In mammalian cells, RNH1 has an established role in mitochondrial DNA replication, and its deletion is embryonically lethal, demonstrating that RNH2 cannot compensate in this setting (17Ruhanen H. Ushakov K. Yasukawa T. Involvement of DNA ligase III and ribonuclease H1 in mitochondrial DNA replication in cultured human cells.Biochim. Biophys.

Ribonuclease H: the enzymes in eukaryotes.FEBS J. 2009; 276: 1494-1505Crossref PubMed Scopus (495) Google Scholar). RNH1 localizes to the mammalian nucleus (21Suzuki Y. Holmes J.B. Cerritelli S.M. Sakhuja K. Minczuk M. Holt I.J. Crouch R.J. An upstream open reading frame and the context of the two AUG codons affect the abundance of mitochondrial and nuclear RNase H1.Mol. Cell. Biol. 2010; 30: 5123-5134Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar), and ectopic RNH1 expression is routinely exploited in mammalian cells to resolve RNA–DNA hybrids. Recently, RNH1 was shown to prevent unwanted recombination events at the telomere by resolving telomeric RNA–DNA hybrids in cells that utilize the alternative lengthening mechanism of telomere maintenance (22Arora R. Lee Y. Wischnewski H. Brun C.M. Schwarz T. Azzalin C.M. RNaseH1 regulates TERRA-telomeric DNA hybrids and telomere maintenance in ALT tumour cells.Nat. Commun. 2014; 5: 5220Crossref PubMed Scopus (252) Google Scholar). Another recent study identified a link between DNA damage and the accumulation of RNA–DNA hybrids at the telomere (23Sagie S. Toubiana S. Hartono S.R. Katzir H. Tzur-Gilat A. Havazelet S. Francastel C. Velasco G. Chédin F. Selig S. Telomeres in ICF syndrome cells are vulnerable to DNA damage due to elevated DNA:RNA hybrids.Nat. Commun. 2017; 8: 14015Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). However, whether RNH1 plays a role in nuclear DNA replication outside of telomeres remains to be explored. Given the role of RNA–DNA hybrids in replication impairment and the ability of RNH1 to resolve such hybrids, we sought to determine whether RNH1 impacts genomic integrity in the mammalian nucleus and if so how. We depleted RNH1 from human cell lines and found that RNH1 depletion resulted in increased RNA–DNA hybrids, DNA damage response, and slowing of DNA replication forks. Importantly, these phenotypes were dependent upon RNH1 nuclease activity, suggesting that the hybrids were responsible for these phenotypes. Our studies uncover a novel role of RNH1 in the mammalian nucleus and extend its important function in nuclear DNA replication. Although RNH2 has well-ascribed functions in the mammalian nucleus, the role of RNH1 has remained more obscure. Because R-loops form throughout the genome and RNH1 can resolve R-loops that would pose barriers to the replication machinery, we hypothesized that RNH1 might play an important role in the nucleus and that its loss might perturb replication fork progression and thus elicit a DNA damage response (4Santos-Pereira J.M. Aguilera A. R loops: new modulators of genome dynamics and function.Nat. Rev. Genet. 2015; 16: 583-597Crossref PubMed Scopus (442) Google Scholar). To test this hypothesis, we depleted RNH1 from normal, checkpoint-competent RPE1 cells and measured the levels of histone H2AX phosphorylation at Ser-139 (γH2AX), a canonical marker of the DNA damage response (24Siddiqui M.S. François M. Fenech M.F. Leifert W.R. Persistent γH2AX: a promising molecular marker of DNA damage and aging.Mutat. Res. Rev. Mutat. Res. 2015; 766: 1-19Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar), in control versus RNH1-depleted cells. Following RNH1 depletion, we observed increased levels of γH2AX, demonstrating that RNH1 depletion induces a DNA damage response (Fig. 1, A and B). These data suggest that RNH1 plays an important role in preserving genome stability. To further interrogate the function of RNH1, we first focused our attention to telomeres, chromosomal ends that contain RNA–DNA hybrids (25Azzalin C.M. Reichenbach P. Khoriauli L. Giulotto E. Lingner J. Telomeric repeat containing RNA and RNA surveillance factors at mammalian chromosome ends.Science. 2007; 318: 798-801Crossref PubMed Scopus (957) Google Scholar). Recent work demonstrates that in cells utilizing the alternative lengthening of telomere mechanism, which maintains telomere length independently of telomerase, RNH1 associates with telomeres and regulates the levels of telomeric RNA–DNA hybrids to prevent telomere loss (22Arora R. Lee Y. Wischnewski H. Brun C.M. Schwarz T. Azzalin C.M. RNaseH1 regulates TERRA-telomeric DNA hybrids and telomere maintenance in ALT tumour cells.Nat. Commun. 2014; 5: 5220Crossref PubMed Scopus (252) Google Scholar). In these cells, depletion of RNH1 led to hybrid accumulation and abrupt telomere excision. A second study suggested that RNH1 plays an important role in resolving RNA–DNA hybrids at the telomere (23Sagie S. Toubiana S. Hartono S.R. Katzir H. Tzur-Gilat A. Havazelet S. Francastel C. Velasco G. Chédin F. Selig S. Telomeres in ICF syndrome cells are vulnerable to DNA damage due to elevated DNA:RNA hybrids.Nat. Commun. 2017; 8: 14015Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). Because the leading strand-replicated telomere is transcribed, RNA–DNA hybrids would be expected to form on the leading strand. Thus, we examined the integrity of the leading strand telomere by performing chromosomal orientation fluorescence in situ hybridization (CO-FISH), which allows one to interrogate the leading versus lagging strand-replicated telomere. Surprisingly, CO-FISH analysis revealed no differences in the leading versus lagging strand telomere in control versus shRNH1 cells (data not shown). However, in the RNH1-depleted cells, we observed a significant increase in telomere free ends in which both leading and lagging strand telomeres were lost, a phenotype suggestive of DNA replication defects (26Takikawa M. Tarumoto Y. Ishikawa F. Fission yeast Stn1 is crucial for semi-conservative replication at telomeres and subtelomeres.Nucleic Acids Res. 2017; 45: 1255-1269Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar) (Fig. 1, C and D). These data suggest that RNH1 assists the replication machinery by resolving RNA–DNA hybrids that could present a topological barrier to replication fork progression. To demonstrate that RNA–DNA hybrids were responsible for the DNA damage and telomere loss phenotype upon RNH1 loss, we next measured the hybrid levels in the nucleus. We treated 293T cells with control (siCtrl) or RNH1-directed (siRNH1) siRNAs and collected cells 48 h later. Transfection with siRNH1 led to a significant reduction in RNH1 mRNA levels (2.5-fold) (Fig. 2A) and protein levels (3.5-fold) (Fig. 2B) compared with levels present in siCtrl cells. To measure the amount of RNA–DNA hybrids in control versus RNH1-depleted cells, we next extracted nuclear DNA lysate and subjected it to DNA–RNA immunoprecipitation (DIP) using the well-characterized RNA–DNA hybrid antibody S9.6 (27Boguslawski S.J. Smith D.E. Michalak M.A. Mickelson K.E. Yehle C.O. Patterson W.L. Carrico R.J. Characterization of monoclonal antibody to DNA.RNA and its application to immunodetection of hybrids.J. Immunol. Methods. 1986; 89: 123-130Crossref PubMed Scopus (259) Google Scholar). We conducted a genomic quantitative PCR on a well-characterized hybrid-forming 5′ pause site of β-actin gene as a readout of hybrids. As a control for specificity, we also pretreated lysates with recombinant RNaseH enzyme in vitro to degrade existing RNA–DNA hybrids in both control and depleted cells. As expected, pretreatment with an in vitro RNaseH enzyme led to a 1.8-fold reduction of RNA–DNA hybrids in control and a 3.5-fold in RNH1-depleted cells, confirming the specificity of the S9.6 antibody. Additionally, immunoprecipitation with an IgG control antibody failed to precipitate RNA–DNA hybrids, indicating that the signals we measured were bona fide RNA–DNA hybrids. Analysis of immunoprecipitations from RNH1-depleted cells revealed a significant 2-fold increase in the nuclear RNA–DNA hybrids compared with those in control cells (Fig. 2C). To further corroborate these findings, we also utilized the S9.6 antibody and carried out immunofluorescence on RPE1 cells. As expected, RNH1-depleted cells showed increased levels of RNA–DNA hybrids as represented by elevated S9.6 signal in the nucleus compared with that in the control cells (Fig. 2, D and E). Together, these data demonstrate that RNH1 depletion can lead to a significant increase in RNA–DNA hybrids and that this increase correlates with increased DNA damage and telomere loss. Given the increased RNA–DNA hybrids, DNA damage, and loss of both telomeric ends, indicative of a replication defect following RNH1 depletion, we hypothesized that RNA–DNA hybrids pose barriers to DNA replication forks. This hypothesis was supported by previous studies showing that the removal of RNA–DNA hybrids by ectopically expressed RNH1 can directly affect replication fork movement in yeast (28Jones R.M. Mortusewicz O. Afzal I. Lorvellec M. García P. Helleday T. Petermann E. Increased replication initiation and conflicts with transcription underlie Cyclin E-induced replication stress.Oncogene. 2013; 32: 3744-3753Crossref PubMed Scopus (174) Google Scholar). To test this hypothesis, we used microfluidic-assisted replication track analysis (maRTA) to directly measure replication fork progression in RPE1 cells depleted of RNH1 (29Berti M. Ray Chaudhuri A. Thangavel S. Gomathinayagam S. Kenig S. Vujanovic M. Odreman F. Glatter T. Graziano S. Mendoza-Maldonado R. Marino F. Lucic B. Biasin V. Gstaiger M. Aebersold R. et al.Human RECQ1 promotes restart of replication forks reversed by DNA topoisomerase I inhibition.Nat. Struct. Mol. Biol. 2013; 20: 347-354Crossref PubMed Scopus (288) Google Scholar, 30Sidorova J.M. Li N. Schwartz D.C. Folch A. Monnat R.J. Microfluidic-assisted analysis of replicating DNA molecules.Nat. Protoc. 2009; 4: 849-861Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). RPE1 cells were transduced with siRNAs, and cells were collected for Western blot analysis 48 h later. As expected, RNH1 depletion resulted in significant DNA damage as evidenced by increased γH2AX (Fig. 3A). In parallel, we carried out maRTA by plating RNH1-depleted or control cells and labeling them with the nucleotide analogs CldU (red) and IdU (green) sequentially for 30 min each to allow us to follow replication fork movement (Fig. 3B). To restrict our analysis to progressing replication forks, we measured IdU tracks that were directly preceded by a CldU track (Fig. 3B). Measuring the lengths of these IdU tracks, we found that RNH1-depleted cells had an average IdU track length of 9.3 ± 0.3 μm, whereas that in the control cells was 14.5 ± 0.4 μm, indicating that the replication forks moved significantly slower in RNH1-depleted cells compared with control cells (Fig. 3C). Given the increase in RNA–DNA hybrids associated with RNH1 loss, these data suggest that RNH1 facilitates efficient DNA replication by clearing RNA–DNA hybrids that would otherwise impede replication fork progression during S phase. To understand how the loss of RNH1 perturbed replication dynamics, we next asked whether other replication parameters including termination, stalling, and origin firing were affected upon RNH1 depletion. Premature termination and stalling events correspond to CldU (red)-only tracks (Fig. 3B). RNH1-depleted cells showed a significant 1.4-fold increase in termination and/or stalling events compared with control cells (Fig. 3D). Next, we analyzed the impact of RNH1 depletion on origin firing to address a possibility that slower fork progression triggers the S phase checkpoint and increases the frequency of origin firing as reported previously (31Zhong Y. Nellimoottil T. Peace J.M. Knott S.R. Villwock S.K. Yee J.M. Jancuska J.M. Rege S. Tecklenburg M. Sclafani R.A. Tavaré S. Aparicio O.M. The level of origin firing inversely affects the rate of replication fork progression.J. Cell. Biol. 2013; 201: 373-383Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). To measure origin firing, the incidence of tracks with either green-only (IdU) color or red flanked by green on both sides was analyzed (Fig. 3B). However, no significant differences in origin firing were observed between RNH1-depleted and control cells (Fig. 3E). Collectively, these results indicate that RNH1 plays an important role in assisting fork movement during DNA replication. We suggest that RNH1 does this by resolving RNA–DNA hybrids that pose barriers to a progressing replication fork. Furthermore, our data provide the first evidence that RNH1 plays a role in global DNA replication in the mammalian nucleus. To further characterize the role of RNH1 in DNA replication, we tested whether the nuclease function of RNH1 was required for this activity. To do this, we created a series of RPE1 cell lines ectopically expressing either a GFP-tagged wild-type (WT) or a well-characterized GFP-tagged nuclease-dead (D145N) form of RNH1 (32Tresini M. Warmerdam D.O. Kolovos P. Snijder L. Vrouwe M.G. Demmers J.A. van IJcken W.F. Grosveld F.G. Medema R.H. Hoeijmakers J.H. Mullenders L.H. Vermeulen W. Marteijn J.A.

To establish a direct role in the nucleus, these RNH1 constructs lacked the mitochondrial targeting sequence present in the endogenous gene, thereby restricting their expression to the nucleus. We confirmed the nuclear localization of ectopically expressed proteins by visualizing GFP expression only in the nucleus (Fig. 4A). These stable RPE1 cells were transfected with an siRNH1 directed toward the 3′-untranslated region (3′-UTR) that did not target the ectopically expressed protein. We observed that RNH1 depletion using a 3′-UTR siRNA was comparable with that of a previously used coding sequence targeting siRNA (Fig. 4B). We also observed robust expression of our ectopically tagged RNH1 proteins and significant depletion of endogenous RNH1 levels (Fig. 4B). Next, using maRTA, we again measured replication fork movement and found that ectopic expression of WT RNH1 restored fork movement to the levels observed in siCtrl cells (Fig. 4C). Indeed, although RNH1-depleted forks moved an IdU length of 8 μm, ectopic expression of WT RNH1 increased this to 12 μm, levels we observed in siCtrl cells. In contrast, ectopic expression of the catalytically dead D145N allele of RNH1 failed to rescue the replication fork movement defect (fork movement was 7.9 μm, nearly identical to that observed in RNH1-depleted cells). Together, these findings demonstrated that the nuclease activity of RNH1 is required for the unperturbed movement of replication forks in mammalian cells. Similarly, we also measured fork termination and stalling events upon ectopic expression of WT and D145N alleles in RNH1-depleted cells. As expected, both events were reversed by ectopic expression of WT RNH1 but not the nuclease-dead allele, thereby reiterating the importance of the nuclease function of RNH1 in the fidelity of replication fork progression (Fig. 4D). Neither WT nor the D145N allele of RNH1 affected the levels of origin firing in RNH1-depleted cells (Fig. 4E). These data suggest that the nuclease activity of RNH1 is required for resolution of RNA–DNA hybrids and therefore efficient movement of replication forks during nuclear DNA replication. Our study establishes a role for RNH1 in genomic DNA replication. Indeed, we illustrate for the first time that RNH1 nuclease activity is required for efficient fork movement during nuclear DNA replication. Furthermore, we have established a correlation between the accumulation of RNA–DNA hybrids and replication defects observed upon RNH1 depletion. Taken together, we propose a model wherein RNH1 resolves RNA–DNA hybrids to assist the replication machinery in its uninterrupted movement during DNA replication. The unscheduled formation and stabilization of RNA–DNA hybrids have been postulated to be detrimental to the replication machinery. The importance of resolving these structures is probably best underscored by the multitude of proteins that act on RNA–DNA structures. Indeed, helicases such as SETX, AQR, and DHX9 in mammalian cells and Sen1 and PIF1 in yeast have all been shown to resolve RNA–DNA hybrids (9Sollier J. Stork C.T. García-Rubio M.L. Paulsen R.D.

Here, we add RNH1 to a growing list of proteins by showing that endogenous RNH1 is required to similarly remove RNA–DNA hybrids and that if these hybrids are not removed replication is significantly impacted. Furthermore, our work demonstrates that these other proteins are unable to compensate for loss of RNH1 in replication fork progression. However, how RNH1 is regulated in the nucleus and how its activity is coordinated with the replication machinery remain unclear. A recent study from Nguyen et al. (37Nguyen H.D. Yadav T Giri S.

We have now expanded our cohort (n = 84) to investigate the levels of anti-Neu5Gc and anti-nonGal/nonNeu5Gc antibodies in healthy humans. Anti-nonGal and anti-nonGal/nonNeu5Gc human IgM and IgG binding to pRBCs and pAECs from GTKO/CD46 and GTKO/CD46/Neu5GcKO pigs were measured by flow cytometry. Anti-Gal and anti-Neu5Gc IgM and IgG levels were measured by ELISA. In summary, (i) the great majority (almost 100%) of humans had anti-Neu5Gc IgM and IgG antibodies that bound to pAECs and approximately 50% had anti-Neu5Gc antibodies that bound to pRBCs, (ii) there was significantly less human antibody binding to pig cells that did not express either Gal or Neu5Gc compared with those that did not express Gal alone, (iii) the levels of both IgM and IgG binding to GTKO/CD46/Neu5GcKO pRBCs and pAECs were low, (iv) the level of anti-Neu5Gc IgG was higher in men than women, (v) the level did not change with age or diet, and there was some variability associated with (vi) previous vaccination history and (vii) the geographic region in which the individual spent his or her childhood. Our study confirms that human antibody binding to RBCs and AECs from GTKO/CD46/Neu5GcKO pigs is greatly reduced compared to binding to GTKO/CD46 cells. However, all humans appear to have a low level of antibody that binds to pAECs that is not directed to either Gal or Neu5Gc. Our findings require consideration in planning clinical trials of xenotransplantation."
https://openalex.org/W2735513027,"A new ichnospecies of a large theropod dinosaur, Megalosauripus transjuranicus, is described from the Reuchenette Formation (Early–Late Kimmeridgian, Late Jurassic) of NW Switzerland. It is based on very well-preserved and morphologically-distinct tracks (impressions) and several trackways, including different preservational types from different tracksites and horizons. All trackways were excavated along federal Highway A16 near Courtedoux (Canton Jura) and systematically documented in the field including orthophotos and laserscans. The best-preserved tracks were recovered and additional tracks were casted. Megalosauripus transjuranicus is characterized by tridactyl tracks with clear claw and digital pad impressions, and notably an exceptionally large and round first phalangeal pad on the fourth digit (PIV1) that is connected to digit IV and forms the round heel area. Due to this combination of features, M. transjuranicus clearly is of theropod (and not ornithopod) origin. M. transjuranicus is compared to other Megalosauripus tracks and similar ichnotaxa and other unassigned tracks from the Early Jurassic to Early Cretaceous. It is clearly different from other ichnogenera assigned to large theropods such as Eubrontes–Grallator from the Late Triassic and Early Jurassic or Megalosauripus–Megalosauropus–Bueckeburgichnus and Therangospodus tracks from the Late Jurassic and Early Cretaceous. A second tridactyl morphotype (called Morphotype II) is different from Megalosauripus transjuranicus in being subsymmetric, longer than wide (sometimes almost as wide as long), with blunt toe impressions and no evidence for discrete phalangeal pad and claw marks. Some Morphotype II tracks are found in trackways that are assigned to M. transjuranicus, to M.? transjuranicus or M. cf. transjuranicus indicating that some Morphotype II tracks are intra-trackway preservational variants of a morphological continuum of Megalosauripus transjuranicus. On the other hand, several up to 40 steps long trackways very consistently present Morphotype II features (notably blunt digits) and do not exhibit any of the features that are typical for Megalosauripus (notably phalangeal pads). Therefore, it is not very likely that these tracks are preservational variants of Megalosauripus transjuranicus or Megalosauripus isp. These trackways are interpreted to have been left by an ornithopod dinosaur. The high frequency of large theropod tracks in tidal-flat deposits of the Jura carbonate platform, associated on single ichnoassemblages with minute to medium-sized tridactyl and tiny to large sauropod tracks has important implications for the dinosaur community and for paleoenvironmental and paleogeographical reconstructions. As with most other known occurrences of Megalosauripus tracks, M. transjuranicus is found in coastal settings, which may reflect the preference of their theropod trackmakers for expanded carbonate flats where food was abundant."

Almost 2000 phage genomes have been sequenced from phages infecting hosts in the phylum Actinobacteria, and analysis of these genomes reveals substantial diversity, pervasive mosaicism, and novel mechanisms for phage replication and lysogeny. Here, we describe the isolation and genomic characterization of 46 phages from environmental samples at various geographic locations in the U.S. infecting a single Arthrobacter sp. strain. These phages include representatives of all three virion morphologies, and Jasmine is the first sequenced podovirus of an actinobacterial host. The phages also span considerable sequence diversity, and can be grouped into 10 clusters according to their nucleotide diversity, and two singletons each with no close relatives. However, the clusters/singletons appear to be genomically well separated from each other, and relatively few genes are shared between clusters. Genome size varies from among the smallest of siphoviral phages (15,319 bp) to over 70 kbp, and G+C contents range from 45–68%, compared to 63.4% for the host genome. Although temperate phages are common among other actinobacterial hosts, these Arthrobacter phages are primarily lytic, and only the singleton Galaxy is likely temperate."
https://openalex.org/W2734653938,"Maize (Zea mays L.) is a globally important staple food crop prone to contamination by aflatoxin, a carcinogenic secondary metabolite produced by the fungus Aspergillus flavus. An efficient approach to reduce accumulation of aflatoxin is the development of germplasm resistant to colonization and toxin production by A. flavus. Lipoxygenases (LOXs) are a group of non-heme iron containing dioxygenase enzymes that catalyze oxygenation of polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs). LOX derived oxylipins play critical roles in plant defense against pathogens including A. flavus. The objectives of this study were to summarize sequence diversity and expression patterns for all LOX genes in the maize genome, and map their effect on aflatoxin accumulation via linkage and association mapping. In total, 13 LOX genes were identified, characterized, and mapped. The sequence of one gene, ZmLOX10, is reported from 5 inbred lines. Genes ZmLOX1/2, 5, 8, 9, 10 and 12 (GRMZM2G156861, or V4 numbers ZM00001D042541 and Zm00001D042540, GRMZM2G102760, GRMZM2G104843, GRMZM2G017616, GRMZM2G015419, and GRMZM2G106748, respectively) fell under previously published QTL in one or more mapping populations and are linked to a measurable reduction of aflatoxin in maize grains. Association mapping results found 28 of the 726 SNPs tested were associated with reduced aflatoxin levels at p ≤ 9.71 x 10-4 according to association statistics. These fell within or near nine of the ZmLOX genes. This work confirms the importance of some lipoxygenases for resistance to aflatoxin accumulation and may be used to direct future genetic selection in maize."
https://openalex.org/W2736304028,"Differences in pet dogs’ and captive wolves’ ability to follow human communicative intents have led to the proposition of several hypotheses regarding the possession and development of social cognitive skills in dogs. It is possible that the social cognitive abilities of pet dogs are induced by indirect conditioning through living with humans, and studying free-ranging dogs can provide deeper insights into differentiating between innate abilities and conditioning in dogs. Free-ranging dogs are mostly scavengers, indirectly depending on humans for their sustenance. Humans can act both as food providers and as threats to these dogs, and thus understanding human gestures can be a survival need for the free-ranging dogs. We tested the responsiveness of such dogs in urban areas toward simple human pointing cues using dynamic proximal points. Our experiment showed that pups readily follow proximal pointing and exhibit weaker avoidance to humans, but stop doing so at the later stages of development. While juveniles showed frequent and prolonged gaze alternations, only adults adjusted their behaviour based on the reliability of the human experimenter after being rewarded. Thus free-ranging dogs show a tendency to respond to human pointing gestures, with a certain level of behavioural plasticity that allows learning from ontogenic experience."
https://openalex.org/W2737846178,"Wireless Sensor Networks (WSNs) are becoming ubiquitous in everyday life due to their applications in weather forecasting, surveillance, implantable sensors for health monitoring and other plethora of applications. WSN is equipped with hundreds and thousands of small sensor nodes. As the size of a sensor node decreases, critical issues such as limited energy, computation time and limited memory become even more highlighted. In such a case, network lifetime mainly depends on efficient use of available resources. Organizing nearby nodes into clusters make it convenient to efficiently manage each cluster as well as the overall network. In this paper, we extend our previous work of grid-based hybrid network deployment approach, in which merge and split technique has been proposed to construct network topology. Constructing topology through our proposed technique, in this paper we have used analytical network process (ANP) model for cluster head selection in WSN. Five distinct parameters: distance from nodes (DistNode), residual energy level (REL), distance from centroid (DistCent), number of times the node has been selected as cluster head (TCH) and merged node (MN) are considered for CH selection. The problem of CH selection based on these parameters is tackled as a multi criteria decision system, for which ANP method is used for optimum cluster head selection. Main contribution of this work is to check the applicability of ANP model for cluster head selection in WSN. In addition, sensitivity analysis is carried out to check the stability of alternatives (available candidate nodes) and their ranking for different scenarios. The simulation results show that the proposed method outperforms existing energy efficient clustering protocols in terms of optimum CH selection and minimizing CH reselection process that results in extending overall network lifetime. This paper analyzes that ANP method used for CH selection with better understanding of the dependencies of different components involved in the evaluation process."
https://openalex.org/W2737747761,"The MYC oncoprotein regulates transcription of a large fraction of the genome as an obligatory heterodimer with the transcription factor MAX. The MYC:MAX heterodimer and MAX:MAX homodimer (hereafter MYC/MAX) bind Enhancer box (E-box) DNA elements (CANNTG) and have the greatest affinity for the canonical MYC E-box (CME) CACGTG. However, MYC:MAX also recognizes E-box variants and was reported to bind DNA in a “non-specific” fashion in vitro and in vivo. Here, in order to identify potential additional non-canonical binding sites for MYC/MAX, we employed high throughput in vitro protein-binding microarrays, along with electrophoretic mobility-shift assays and bioinformatic analyses of MYC-bound genomic loci in vivo. We identified all hexameric motifs preferentially bound by MYC/MAX in vitro, which include the low-affinity non-E-box sequence AACGTT, and found that the vast majority (87%) of MYC-bound genomic sites in a human B cell line contain at least one of the top 21 motifs bound by MYC:MAX in vitro. We further show that high MYC/MAX concentrations are needed for specific binding to the low-affinity sequence AACGTT in vitro and that elevated MYC levels in vivo more markedly increase the occupancy of AACGTT sites relative to CME sites, especially at distal intergenic and intragenic loci. Hence, MYC binds diverse DNA motifs with a broad range of affinities in a sequence-specific and dose-dependent manner, suggesting that MYC overexpression has more selective effects on the tumor transcriptome than previously thought."
https://openalex.org/W2736873309,"Since the advent of tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs) such as imatinib, nilotinib, and dasatinib, chronic myelogenous leukemia (CML) prognosis has improved greatly. However, ~30–40% of patients develop resistance to imatinib therapy. Although most resistance is caused by mutations in the BCR-ABL kinase domain, 50–85% of these patients develop resistance in the absence of new mutations. In these cases, targeting other pathways may be needed to regain clinical response. Using label-free Raman spectromicroscopy, we evaluated a number of leukemia cell lines and discovered an aberrant accumulation of cholesteryl ester (CE) in CML, which was found to be a result of BCR-ABL kinase activity. CE accumulation in CML was found to be a cancer-specific phenomenon as untransformed cells did not accumulate CE. Blocking cholesterol esterification with avasimibe, a potent inhibitor of acyl-CoA cholesterol acyltransferase 1 (ACAT-1), significantly suppressed CML cell proliferation in Ba/F3 cells with the BCR-ABLT315I mutation and in K562 cells rendered imatinib resistant without mutations in the BCR-ABL kinase domain (K562R cells). Furthermore, the combination of avasimibe and imatinib caused a profound synergistic inhibition of cell proliferation in K562R cells, but not in Ba/F3T315I. This synergistic effect was confirmed in a K562R xenograft mouse model. Analysis of primary cells from a BCR-ABL mutation-independent imatinib resistant patient by mass cytometry suggested that the synergy may be due to downregulation of the MAPK pathway by avasimibe, which sensitized the CML cells to imatinib treatment. Collectively, these data demonstrate a novel strategy for overcoming BCR-ABL mutation-independent TKI resistance in CML."
https://openalex.org/W2735004977,"Introduction Anxiety and depression are highly prevalent during adolescence and characterized by negative interpretation biases. Cognitive bias modification of interpretations (CBM-I) may reduce such biases and improve emotional functioning. However, as findings have been mixed and the traditional scenario training is experienced as relatively boring, a picture-based type of training might be more engaging and effective. Methods The current study investigated short- and long-term effects (up to 6 months) and users’ experience of two types of CBM-I procedure in adolescents with heightened symptoms of anxiety or depression (N = 119, aged 12–18 year). Participants were randomized to eight online sessions of text-based scenario training, picture-word imagery training, or neutral control training. Results No significant group differences were observed on primary or secondary emotional outcomes. A decrease in anxiety and depressive symptoms, and improvements in emotional resilience were observed, irrespective of condition. Scenario training marginally reduced negative interpretation bias on a closely matched assessment task, while no such effects were found on a different task, nor for the picture-word or control group. Subjective evaluations of all training paradigms were relatively negative and the imagery component appeared particularly difficult for adolescents with higher symptom levels. Conclusions The current results question the preventive efficacy and feasibility of both CBM-I procedures as implemented here in adolescents."

Apart from the need for enhanced security, the media and entertainment sectors have also been applying biometrics in the emerging market of user-adaptable objects/systems to make these systems more user-friendly. However, the complexity of some state-of-the-art biometric systems (e.g., iris recognition) or their high false rejection rate (e.g., fingerprint recognition) is neither compatible with the simple hardware architecture required by reduced-size devices nor the new trend of implementing smart objects within the dynamic market of the Internet of Things (IoT). It was recently shown that an individual can be recognized by extracting features from their electrocardiogram (ECG). However, most current ECG-based biometric algorithms are computationally demanding and/or rely on relatively large (several seconds) ECG samples, which are incompatible with the aforementioned application fields. Here, we present a computationally low-cost method (patent pending), including simple mathematical operations, for identifying a person using only three ECG morphology-based characteristics from a single heartbeat. The algorithm was trained/tested using ECG signals of different duration from the Physionet database on more than 60 different training/test datasets. The proposed method achieved maximal averaged accuracy of 97.450% in distinguishing each subject from a ten-subject set and false acceptance and rejection rates (FAR and FRR) of 5.710±1.900% and 3.440±1.980%, respectively, placing Beat-ID in a very competitive position in terms of the FRR/FAR among state-of-the-art methods. Furthermore, the proposed method can identify a person using an average of 1.020 heartbeats. It therefore has FRR/FAR behavior similar to obtaining a fingerprint, yet it is simpler and requires less expensive hardware. This method targets low-computational/energy-cost scenarios, such as tiny wearable devices (e.g., a smart object that automatically adapts its configuration to the user). A hardware proof-of-concept implementation is presented as an annex to this paper."

Methods We included adults (≥15 years) and children (<15 years) enrolled in the cohort in 2005–2014. The cohort underwent significant changes from autumn 2012 to optimise care. We evaluated mortality and loss to follow-up (LTFU) using competing risks methods, ART usage, opportunistic infections (OI), co-infections and laboratory abnormalities. Results Overall, 7010 adults and 680 children were enrolled; enrolment peaked in 2008 but has increased steadily since 2011. Among adults (65% female; median age 37 [interquartile range 31–45] years), the proportion referred from hospital wards quadrupled in 2013–14 versus earlier years. 653 (9%) adults died and 2648 (38%) were LTFU; the five-year cumulative probabilities of death and LTFU were 10.3% and 44.0%, respectively. Among children, 69 (10%) died and 225 (33%) were LTFU. The corresponding five-year probabilities were 12.1% and 39.6%. Adult ART use (regardless of eligibility) increased from 5% in 2005 to 89% in 2014 (similarly among children), with 9% on second-line therapy in 2014 (17% of children). OI diagnoses increased over time; tuberculosis prevalence at enrolment quadrupled from 6% in 2011 to 26% in 2014. The proportion of newly-enrolled participants assessed for laboratory abnormalities peaked at nearly 100% in 2014 (from a minimum of 24%), yet abnormality prevalences remained fairly constant. Conclusions In this cohort, ART usage improved dramatically and is approaching targets of 90%. Improved screening led to increases in detection of OIs and laboratory abnormalities, suggesting that a large number of these co-morbidities previously went undetected and untreated. Further work will address the high LTFU rates and implications for mortality estimates, and the management and outcomes of co-morbidities."

Sm biofilms were formed during 5 days on bovine enamel slabs of known surface hardness (SH). The biofilms were exposed to sucrose 10% or glucose + fructose 10.5% (carbohydrates that differ on EPS formation), 8x/day but were maintained in starvation during the night. Biofilm samples were harvested during two moments, on the end of the 4th day and in the morning of the 5th day, conditions of sugar abundance and starvation, respectively. The slabs were also collected to evaluate the percentage of surface hardness loss (%SHL). The biofilms were analyzed for EPS soluble and insoluble and intracellular polysaccharides (IPS), viable bacteria (CFU), biofilm architecture and biomass. pH, calcium and acid concentration were determined in the culture medium. The data were analyzed by two-way ANOVA followed by Tukey's test or Student's t-test. The effect of the factor carbohydrate treatment for polysaccharide analysis was significant (p < 0.05) but not the harvest moment (p > 0.05). Larger amounts of soluble and insoluble EPS and IPS were formed in the sucrose group when compared to glucose + fructose group (p < 0.05), but they were not metabolized during starvation time (S-EPS, p = 0.93; I-EPS, p = 0.11; and IPS = 0.96). Greater enamel %SHL was also found for the sucrose group (p < 0.05) but the demineralization did not increase during starvation (p = 0.09). In conclusion, the findings suggest that EPS metabolization by S. mutans during night starvation do not contribute to increase enamel demineralization occurred during the daily abundance of sugar."

The aim of this study was to assess the variation in AgNP-induced lung inflammation and toxicity across multiple inbred mouse strains and to use genome-wide association (GWA) mapping to identify potential candidate susceptibility genes. Mice received doses of 0.25 mg/kg of either 20-nm citrate-coated AgNPs or citrate buffer using oropharyngeal aspiration. Neutrophils in bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF) served as markers of inflammation. We found significant strain- and treatment-dependent variation in neutrophils in BALF.

https://openalex.org/W2735636636,"Increased production of reactive oxygen/nitrogen species (ROS) and impaired cellular Ca2+ handling are implicated in the prolonged low-frequency force depression (PLFFD) observed in skeletal muscle after both metabolically and mechanically demanding exercise. Metabolically demanding high-intensity exercise can induce PLFFD accompanied by ROS-dependent fragmentation of the sarcoplasmic reticulum Ca2+ release channels, the ryanodine receptor 1s (RyR1s). We tested whether similar changes occur after mechanically demanding eccentric contractions. Human subjects performed 100 repeated drop jumps, which require eccentric knee extensor contractions upon landing. This exercise caused a major PLFFD, such that maximum voluntary and electrically evoked forces did not recover within 24 h. Drop jumps induced only minor signs of increased ROS, and RyR1 fragmentation was observed in only 3 of 7 elderly subjects. Also, isolated mouse muscle preparations exposed to drop-jump-mimicking eccentric contractions showed neither signs of increased ROS nor RyR1 fragmentation. Still, the free cytosolic [Ca2+] during tetanic contractions was decreased by ∼15% 1 h after contractions, which can explain the exaggerated force decrease at low-stimulation frequencies but not the major frequency-independent force depression. In conclusion, PLFFD caused by mechanically demanding eccentric contractions does not involve any major increase in ROS or RyR1 fragmentation.-Kamandulis, S., de Souza Leite, F., Hernandez, A., Katz, A., Brazaitis, M., Bruton, J.

Materials and methods Systemic lupus in miR155-deficient and wild type mice was induced upon injection of pristane and analyzed after 8 months, PBS-injected mice served as controls. Glomerulonephritis and pneumonitis were quantified using the kidney biopsy score and a newly adapted histomorphometric image analysis system; lung tissue was further analyzed by tissue cytometry. Serum levels of anti-dsDNA, anti-histone and anti-chromatin antibodies were measured by ELISA. Frequencies of B cells, activated and regulatory CD4+ T cells as well as Th1, Th2, Th17 cells were measured by flow cytometry. RT-qPCR was used to measure expression levels of interferon-signature and T-cell subset related as well as miR155-associated genes. Results After induction of lupus, miR155-deficient mice had significant less pulmonary involvement (perivascular inflammatory area in mm2/mm2 lung area 0.00092±0.00015 vs. 0.0027±0.00075, p = 0.0347) and renal disease (glomerular activity score 1.95±0.19 vs 3±0.26, p = 0.0029) compared to wild types. MiR155-deficient mice had significantly lower serum levels of disease-associated auto-antibodies and decreased frequencies of activated CD4+CD25+ (Foxp3-) cells. Upon restimulation, CD4+ cells showed a less pronounced Th2 and Th17 and a slightly decreased Th1 response in mir155-deficient mice. Pristane-treated wild types showed significantly up-regulated expression of genes related to the INF-signature (MX1, IP10, IRF7, ISG15). Conclusions MiR155-deficient mice had less severe organ involvement, lower serum auto-antibody levels, a less prominent T cell response and lower expressions of genes jointly responsible for disease development. Thus, antagonizing miR155 might be a future approach in treating SLE."

Nationwide, multicenter retrospective cohort study. Medical records of BTRE patients seen from 1/1/2010 to 12/31/2011, followed for at least one month were examined. Information included age, sex, tumor type/treatments, epilepsy characteristics, antiepileptic drugs (AEDs). Time to modify first AED due to inefficacy and/or toxicity was assessed with the Kaplan-Meier method and Cox proportional hazard models were used to identify predictors of treatment outcome. Enrolled were 808 patients (447 men, 361 women) from 26 epilepsy centers. Follow-up ranged 1 to 423 months (median 18 months). 732 patients underwent surgery, 483 chemotherapy (CT), 508 radiotherapy. All patients were treated with AEDs. Levetiracetam was the most common drug. 377 patients (46.7%) were still on first drug at end of follow-up, 338 (41.8%) needed treatment modifications (uncontrolled seizures, 229; side effects, 101; poor compliance, 22). Treatment discontinuation for lack of efficacy was associated with younger age, chemotherapy, and center with <20 cases. Treatment discontinuation for side effects was associated with female sex, enzyme-inducing drugs and center with > 20 cases. About one-half of patients with BTRE were on first AED at end of follow-up. Levetiracetam was the most common drug. A non enzyme-inducing AED was followed by a lower risk of drug discontinuation for SE."
https://openalex.org/W2735858272,"Barnacles are sessile macro-invertebrates, found along rocky shores in coastal areas worldwide. The euryhaline bay barnacle Balanus improvisus (Darwin, 1854) (= Amphibalanus improvisus) can tolerate a wide range of salinities, but the molecular mechanisms underlying the osmoregulatory capacity of this truly brackish species are not well understood. Aquaporins are pore-forming integral membrane proteins that facilitate transport of water, small solutes and ions through cellular membranes, and that have been shown to be important for osmoregulation in many organisms. The knowledge of the function of aquaporins in crustaceans is, however, limited and nothing is known about them in barnacles. We here present the repertoire of aquaporins from a thecostracan crustacean, the barnacle B. improvisus, based on genome and transcriptome sequencing. Our analyses reveal that B. improvisus contains eight genes for aquaporins. Phylogenetic analysis showed that they represented members of the classical water aquaporins (Aqp1, Aqp2), the aquaglyceroporins (Glp1, Glp2), the unorthodox aquaporin (Aqp12) and the arthropod-specific big brain aquaporin (Bib). Interestingly, we also found two big brain-like proteins (BibL1 and BibL2) constituting a new group of aquaporins not yet described in arthropods. In addition, we found that the two water-specific aquaporins were expressed as C-terminal splice variants. Heterologous expression of some of the aquaporins followed by functional characterization showed that Aqp1 transported water and Glp2 water and glycerol, agreeing with the predictions of substrate specificity based on 3D modeling and phylogeny. To investigate a possible role for the B. improvisus aquaporins in osmoregulation, mRNA expression changes in adult barnacles were analysed after long-term acclimation to different salinities. The most pronounced expression difference was seen for AQP1 with a substantial (>100-fold) decrease in the mantle tissue in low salinity (3 PSU) compared to high salinity (33 PSU). Our study provides a base for future mechanistic studies on the role of aquaporins in osmoregulation."
https://openalex.org/W2613152541,"Brucellosis is a bacterial disease, which, although affecting cattle primarily, has been associated with human infections, making its detection an important challenge. The existing gold standard diagnosis relies on the culture of bacteria which is a lengthy and costly process, taking up to 45 days. New technologies based on molecular diagnosis have been proposed, either through dip-stick, immunological assays, which have limited specificity, or using nucleic acid tests, which enable to identify the pathogen, but are impractical for use in the field, where most of the reservoir cases are located. Here we demonstrate a new test based on hybridization assays with metal nanoparticles, which, upon detection of a specific pathogen-derived DNA sequence, yield a visual colour change. We characterise the components used in the assay with a range of analytical techniques and show sensitivities down to 1000 cfu/ml for the detection of Brucella. Finally, we demonstrate that the assay works in a range of bovine samples including semen, milk and urine, opening up the potential for its use in the field, in low-resource settings."
https://openalex.org/W2737452984,"Background Epidemiology studies have shown that ambient concentrations of ozone and fine particulate matter (PM2.5) are associated with increased emergency department (ED) visits and hospital admissions (HAs) for asthma. Objective Evaluate the impact of outdoor pollen, respiratory infections, and socioeconomic status (SES) on the associations between ambient ozone and PM2.5 and asthma HAs in New York City. Methods Daily ozone, PM2.5, meteorological factors, pollen, and hospitalization records during 1999 to 2009 were obtained for New York City residents. Daily counts of HAs for asthma and respiratory infections were calculated for all-age and specific age groups, and for high- and low-SES communities. Generalized additive models were used to examine ambient concentrations of ozone and PM2.5 and asthma HAs, potential confounding effects of outdoor pollen and HAs for respiratory infections, and potential effect modification by neighborhood SES. Results Both ozone and PM2.5 were statistically significantly associated with increased asthma HAs in children aged 6–18 years (per 10 ppb increase in ozone: RR = 1.0203, 95% CI: 1.0028–1.0382; per 10 μg/m3 increase in PM2.5: RR = 1.0218, 95% CI: 1.0007–1.0434), but not with total asthma HAs, or asthma HAs in other age groups. These associations were stronger for children living in the high-SES areas. Adjustment for respiratory infection HAs at various lags did not result in changes greater than 10% in the risk estimates for either ozone or PM2.5. In contrast, adjustment for outdoor pollen generally attenuated the estimated RRs for both ozone and PM2.5. Conclusions Ambient ozone and PM2.5 are associated with asthma HAs in school-age children, and these associations are not modified by SES. HAs for respiratory infections do not appear to be a confounder for observed ozone- and PM2.5-asthma HAs associations, but pollen may be a weak confounder."
https://openalex.org/W2738790986,"The exact cause of Alzheimer's disease (AD) and the role of metals in its etiology remain unclear. We have used an analytical approach, based on inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry coupled with multivariate statistical analysis, to study the profiles of a wide range of metals in AD patients and healthy controls. AD cannot be cured and the lack of sensitive biomarkers that can be used in the early stages of the disease may contribute to this treatment failure. In the present study, we measured plasma levels of amyloid-β1-42(0.142±0.029μg/L)and furin(2.292±1.54μg/L), together with those of the metalloproteinases, insulin-degrading enzyme(1.459±1.14μg/L) and neprilysin(0.073±0.015μg/L), in order to develop biomarkers for AD. Partial least squares discriminant analysis models were used to refine intergroup differences and we discovered that four metals(Mn, Al, Li, Cu) in peripheral blood were strongly associated with AD. Aberration in homeostasis of these metals may alter levels of proteinases, such as furin, which are associated with neurodegeneration in AD and can be a used as plasma-based biomarkers."
https://openalex.org/W2735830395,"Objective To investigate the association between preceding endometriosis and gestational hypertension-preeclampsia (GH-PE). Methods In this nationwide population-based longitudinal study, data from 1998–2012 Taiwan National Health Insurance Research Database were used. We used ICD9-CM codes 617.X and 642.X respectively for the diagnoses of endometriosis and GH-PE, which were further confirmed by examining medical records of surgeries, blood pressure and urine protein to ensure the accuracy of the diagnoses. The study excluded women diagnosed with endometriosis at < 15 or > 45 years of age, chronic hypertension, and GH-PE prior to endometriosis. Each pregnant woman with a prior diagnosis of endometriosis was matched to 4 pregnant women without endometriosis by age. Logistic regression analysis was used to calculate odds ratios (ORs) for the risk of GH-PE with adjustment for age, occupation, urbanization, economic status and comorbidities. Results Among 6,300 women with a prior endometriosis diagnosis who were retrieved from a population of 1,000,000 residents, 2,578 (40.92%) had subsequent pregnancies that were eligible for further analysis and were compared with 10,312 pregnant women without previous endometriosis. GH-PE occurred more in women with prior endometriosis as compared to those without endometriosis (3.88% vs. 1.63%, p<0.0001). Further analysis revealed prior endometriosis was associated with GH-PE (adjusted OR = 2.27; 95% CI:1.76–2.93). For danazol-treated and non-danazol-treated subgroups, the incidences of GH-PE were 3.13% (15/480) and 4.05% (85/2,098), respectively. Although the risk for subsequent GH-PE was lower (adjusted OR = 1.49; 95% CI:0.86–2.56) after receiving danazol treatment than average (adjusted OR = 2.27; 95% CI:1.76–2.93) for women with preceding endometriosis, the reduction of risk was not statistically remarkable for danazol-treated (adjusted OR = 1.49) vs. non-danazol-treated (adjusted OR = 2.48) subgroups (p heterogeneity = 0.12). Conclusions Preceding endometriosis is an independent and significant risk factor for the occurrence of GH-PE."

Many novel heart- and skeletal muscle-specific proteins have been discovered and suggested to play an important role in various signaling pathways, e.g. the previously described protein family of calsarcins (5Frey N. Richardson J.A. Olson E.N. Calsarcins, a novel family of sarcomeric calcineurin-binding proteins.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2000; 97: 14632-14637Crossref PubMed Scopus (251) Google Scholar) that directly interacts with the serine/threonine phosphatase calcineurin. Calsarcin-1 knock-out mice are sensitized to pathological stimuli such as pressure overload, resulting in an excessive hypertrophic response and severe cardiomyopathy (6Frey N. Barrientos T. Shelton J.M. Frank D. Rütten H. Gehring D. Kuhn C. Lutz M. Rothermel B. Bassel-Duby R. Richardson J.A. Katus H.A. Hill J.A. Olson E.N.

Overexpression of calsarcin-1 is sufficient to inhibit Gq agonist-induced hypertrophy and suppress calcineurin signaling in the heart (7Frank D. Kuhn C. van Eickels M. Gehring D. Hanselmann C.

The calcium/calmodulin-dependent phosphatase calcineurin and its downstream targets, transcription factors of the nuclear factor of activated T-cells (NFAT) family, play essential roles in cardiomyocyte signaling (8Molkentin J.D.

Dephosphorylation of these transcription factors by calcineurin promotes their translocation into the nucleus and induces the pro-hypertrophic gene program. Overexpression of constitutively active calcineurin in mouse heart leads to substantial ventricular hypertrophy, massive cardiac enlargement, and heart failure (8Molkentin J.D. Lu J.R. Antos C.L.

In contrast, mice lacking the most prevalent calcineurin isoform (CnAβ) are dramatically impaired in their ability to establish cardiac hypertrophy induced by pressure overload and angiotensin II or isoproterenol infusions (10Bueno O.F.

Similarly, the immunosuppressive agents cyclosporine A or tacrolimus (FK506) can block hypertrophic growth in cardiomyocytes by inhibiting calcineurin through the formation of complexes with immunophilins (11Liu J.

To identify previously unknown sarcomeric proteins, we screened expressed sequence tag (EST) databases for uncharacterized proteins predominantly found in cardiac and skeletal muscle cDNA libraries. Using a bioinformatics approach, we found an open reading frame coding for a 1435-aa protein, which we termed CEFIP (cardiac-enriched FHL2-interacting protein). This cardiac- and muscle-specific protein is dysregulated in human ischemic and dilated cardiomyopathy as well as in murine models of heart failure and hypertrophy. By performing yeast two-hybrid (Y2H) screens, we identified a well-known protein FHL2 (four and a half-LIM domains 2), which is primarily expressed in the heart, as one of the binding partners of CEFIP. FHL2 has recently been described to bind calcineurin and repress pathological cardiac growth. In contrast, we found that the overexpression of CEFIP led to dramatic induction of the hypertrophic marker genes and NFAT-dependent signaling. Taken together, we identified CEFIP as a novel z-disc protein and established its role as an activator of calcineurin-dependent hypertrophy in cardiomyocytes. Numerous z-disc proteins have recently been identified as a cause for cardiomyopathies and cardiac diseases. Based on the notion that almost all of these are expressed in a tissue-restricted pattern, we performed an in silico screen for uncharacterized heart-specific expressed genes (12Will R.D. Eden M. Just S. Hansen A. Eder A. Frank D. Kuhn C. Seeger T.S. Oehl U. Wiemann S. Korn B. Koegl M. Rottbauer W. Eschenhagen T. Katus H.A. Frey N. Myomasp/LRRC39, a heart- and muscle-specific protein, is a novel component of the sarcomeric M-band and is involved in stretch sensing.Circ. Res. 2010; 107: 1253-1264Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). Data mining and extraction mainly relied on T-STAG (Tissue-S) and Unigene EST databases. Utilizing this approach, we recently also discovered the cardiac z-disc protein Fbxl-22, which controls turnover of specific sarcomeric proteins (13Spaich S. Will R.D. Just S. Spaich S. Kuhn C. Frank D. Berger I.M. Wiemann S. Korn B. Koegl M. Backs J. Katus H.A. Rottbauer W. Frey N.

Res. 2012; 111: 1504-1516Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). Several of the newly identified expressed sequence tags correspond to the Homo sapiens Unigene cluster Hs.585480 and the Mus musculus Unigene cluster Mm.318319 encoding C10orf71. Here, we describe a so far uncharacterized gene that we termed CEFIP (Cardiac enriched FHL2-interacting protein; human NM_001135196.1 and mouse NM_001195097.1). These NCBI reference sequences were used for designing probes containing the open reading frame. Northern blot analyses of multiple human and mouse tissues indeed showed a heart- and skeletal muscle-specific expression pattern (Fig. 1A). These results could be confirmed in quantitative real-time PCR experiments of multiple mouse tissue samples (Fig. 1B). To also analyze the expression of CEFIP at the protein level, Western blottings of several mouse tissue samples were performed. Because there was no antibody for CEFIP available, we generated a novel rabbit antiserum using a 354-aa fragment of mouse N-terminal CEFIP as immunogen. To verify the specificity of the antiserum, a multiple tissue Western blotting was probed with the novel CEFIP antibody, and another blot with antibody preincubated with the CEFIP fragment used for immunization served as control. Again, these blots revealed strong expression of CEFIP in mouse heart and skeletal muscle tissue, whereas the peptide displacement confirms the antibody's specificity at ∼250 kDa (Fig. 1C). The full open reading frame encodes a 1435-aa (human NP_001128668.1) and a 1412-aa (mouse NP_001182026.1) protein, respectively. The alignment of the CEFIP protein sequence reveals that it is highly evolutionarily conserved among different species (Fig. 1D and supplemental Fig. 1). Surprisingly, it only contains a domain of unknown function (DUF4585, pfam15232) that is shared with proline-rich basic protein 1 (PROB1), a protein with unknown function that is also mainly expressed in striated muscles, but no other known protein domains. To examine the subcellular localization of CEFIP, we used the newly generated antibody for immunostaining in cardiomyocytes (supplemental Fig. 2). Staining of cultivated neonatal rat cardiomyocytes with the anti-CEFIP antiserum showed a signal at the z-disc co-labeled with the well-characterized α-actinin2 antibody (Fig. 2A) (7Frank D. Kuhn C. van Eickels M. Gehring D. Hanselmann C. Lippl S. Will R. Katus H.A. Frey N.

Mutations in the muscle LIM protein and α-actinin-2 genes in dilated cardiomyopathy and endocardial fibroelastosis.Mol. Genet. Metab. 2003; 80: 207-215Crossref PubMed Scopus (215) Google Scholar). Similarly, co-immunostaining in isolated adult rat ventricular cardiomyocytes with anti-α-actinin2 and anti-CEFIP revealed an overlapping fluorescence pattern (Fig. 2B). Subcellular immunolocalization in cryosections of intact mouse heart again confirmed z-disc localization for CEFIP (Fig. 2C). To identify a potential patho-physiological relevance of CEFIP in vivo, we determined its expression in established models of cardiac diseases. CEFIP was significantly up-regulated in mouse models of hypertrophy like biomechanical stress due to transverse aortic constriction (TAC), calcineurin-TG mice (CnA-TG), and models of dilated cardiomyopathy, including calsarcin-1 knock-out (CS1-KO (15Schoensiegel F. Bekeredjian R. Schrewe A. Weichenhan D. Frey N. Katus H.A. Ivandic B.T. Atrial natriuretic peptide and osteopontin are useful markers of cardiac disorders in mice.Comp. Med. 2007; 57: 546-553PubMed Google Scholar)) and muscle LIM protein knock-out (MLP-KO) mice (Fig. 3, A–D). Consistently, the expression level of CEFIP mRNA was significantly higher in samples of myocardial tissue from human patients suffering from ischemic (ICM) or dilated (DCM) cardiomyopathy compared with non-failing controls (Fig. 3E). Previously, it was shown that sarcomeric z-disc proteins play an important role in cardiomyocyte function and signaling (1Frank D. Kuhn C. Katus H.A. Frey N. The sarcomeric Z-disc: a nodal point in signalling and disease.J. Mol. Med. 2006; 84: 446-468Crossref PubMed Scopus (190) Google Scholar). To elucidate the role of CEFIP in cardiomyocytes, we generated adenoviral constructs for overexpression or knockdown of CEFIP allowing gain and loss of function experiments. NRVCMs were infected by AdCEFIP or by a control virus overexpressing β-galactosidase (AdLacZ) and treated with the hypertrophy-inducing agent phenylephrine (PE, 100 μm). The adenoviral infection with AdCEFIP led to an overexpression of CEFIP up to 8-fold on the mRNA level and 9.7-fold on the protein level (Fig. 4, A and B), which was accompanied by an induction of members of the hypertrophic gene program such as NppA/ANF (2.36-fold), NppB/BNP (1.63-fold), Acta1 (1.9-fold), and RCAN1.4 (2-fold) (Fig. 4C). Similarly, overexpression of CEFIP significantly increased the cell-surface area (CSA), equivalent to the increased CSA due to stimulation with PE (100 μm, 24 h). Moreover, the presence of PE with AdCEFIP treatment further enhanced cardiomyocyte hypertrophy (Fig. 4, C and D). Conversely, down-regulation of CEFIP by 72% at the mRNA level and 64% at the protein level (Fig. 4, E and F), due to synthetic miRNA overexpression, revealed no differences in the expression pattern of the hypertrophic gene markers under baseline conditions, but it blunted increased expression following stimulation with PE (Fig. 4G). Interestingly, CSA is decreased in AdmiR-CEFIP-treated cardiomyocytes compared with cells treated with AdmiR-Control at baseline (Fig. 4H). Of note, AdmiR-CEFIP treatment abrogated cardiomyocyte hypertrophy induced by phenylephrine (Fig. 4H). To establish either a potential structural or a more dynamic role for CEFIP, we studied the dynamic behavior of CEFIP with the help of FRAP. Cultured myotubes derived from immortalized mouse myoblasts were transduced with CEFIP-EGFP. Importantly, also in these skeletal muscle cells, EGFP-tagged CEFIP targeted to z-discs. Single z-discs in these transduced cells were bleached with a laser using a spinning disc confocal microscope (Fig. 5A and supplemental Movie S1). Analysis of CEFIP recovery showed a biphasic curve. The biexponential fit accounts for a fast and a slow phase (Fig. 5B). Because the initial fast recovery is to some extent caused by lateral diffusion of unbound EGFP-tagged protein (3Leber Y.

Mol. Genet. 2016; 25: 2776-2788PubMed Google Scholar), we focused on the slow halftime (t½ slow) of CEFIP that indicates the exchange process of bound proteins with the soluble fraction. The exchange of CEFIP was extremely fast with a t½ slow of 32 ± 5 s, while 91 ± 3% of the protein was in the mobile fraction (Fig. 5, C and D). This half-time is comparable with that previously found for FLNc and aciculin/PGM5 in mammalian cultured muscle cells, whereas that of α-actinin2 and especially titin is considerably slower (Fig. 5E). Therefore, CEFIP seems to belong to the group of highly dynamic z-disc proteins involved in mechanosensing, signaling, and myofibrillar remodeling (3Leber Y. Ruparelia A.A. Kirfel G. van der Ven P.F. Hoffmann B. Merkel R. Bryson-Richardson R.J. Fürst D.O. Filamin C is a highly dynamic protein associated with fast repair of myofibrillar microdamage.Hum. Mol.

To unravel a potential function of CEFIP in cardiomyocyte signaling, we performed Y2H experiments to identify interacting proteins. Because of auto-activation of the full-length construct, we used three different protein fragments (289–966, 966–2160, and 2160–3168 nt) as bait (Fig. 5F and Table 1). Interestingly, in screens of two fragments (966–2160 and 2160–3168 nt), we found several prey clones coding for the well-known titin and filamin-binding protein FHL2 (four and a half-LIM domains 2). Of note, this heart-specific protein also localizes to the z-disc (17Hojayev B. Rothermel B.A. Gillette T.G. Hill J.A. FHL2 binds calcineurin and represses pathological cardiac growth.Mol. Cell. Biol. 2012; 32: 4025-4034Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). We confirmed the interaction between HA-tagged FHL2 and Myc-tagged CEFIP via co-immunoprecipitation (Fig. 5G). Furthermore, immunostaining of adult rat ventricular cardiomyocytes confirmed co-localization of CEFIP and FHL2 at the sarcomeric z-disc (Fig. 5H). FHL2 has recently been described to directly bind to calcineurin and to repress pathological cardiac growth (17Hojayev B. Rothermel B.A. Gillette T.G. Hill J.A. FHL2 binds calcineurin and represses pathological cardiac growth.Mol. Cell. Biol. 2012; 32: 4025-4034Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). Given this information and the pro-hypertrophic effects CEFIP exerted on cardiomyocytes, we next examined whether calcineurin signaling is affected by CEFIP. NRVCMs co-infected with a reporter adenovirus expressing luciferase under control of an NFAT-responsive promoter showed a 2.0-fold up-regulation of NFAT-luciferase activity on adenoviral overexpression of CEFIP. This effect was further enhanced in the presence of constitutively active calcineurin (Fig. 6A). Similar to treatment with phenylephrine, stimulation with calcineurin and simultaneously overexpressed CEFIP led to “super”-induction of the hypertrophy marker genes NppA/ANF (1.7-fold), NppB/BNP (1.8-fold), and RCAN1.4 (3-fold) (Fig. 6B). Consistently, cardiomyocyte hypertrophy, as assessed by CSA measurements, was exaggerated in the presence of both calcineurin and CEFIP (Fig. 6C). Conversely, we observed a dose-dependent reduction of NFAT-luc activity upon miRNA-mediated CEFIP knockdown, even in presence of calcineurin overexpression (Fig. 6D). Likewise, the induction of hypertrophic marker genes and the increase in cell-surface area caused by stimulation with calcineurin was attenuated in the absence of CEFIP (Fig. 6, E and F).Table 1List of potential CEFIP-binding partnersPreyGene descriptionGene IDProteinAccession no.Bait CEFIP (nt 289–966) ACTN2Actinin α288α-actinin-2 isoform 1NP_001094 DESDesmin1674DesminNP_1918 DYNLL1Dynein light chain LC8-type 18655Dynein light chain LC8-type 1AAI04245 EDC4Enhancer of mRNA decapping 423644Enhancer of mRNA decapping 4AAH64567 EFEMP2EGF-containing fibulin-like extracellular matrix protein 230008Fibulin-4CAA10791 HSPB3Heat shock protein family B (small) member 38988Heat shock protein β-3NP_006299.1 HSPB2Heat shock protein family B (small) member 23316Heat shock 27-kDa protein 2AAI09394 IMMTInner membrane mitochondrial protein10989Proliferation-inducing gene 4AAP69987 IMMTInner membrane mitochondrial protein10989Inner membrane protein, mitochondrial (mitofilin)AAH02412 LZTS2Leucine zipper tumor suppressor 284445LAPSER1AAK31577 MPRIPMyosin phosphatase Rho-interacting protein23164Myosin phosphatase Rho-interacting protein isoformNP_958431 PDE4DIPPhosphodiesterase 4D-interacting protein9659Phosphodiesterase 4D-interacting proteinAAH78660 VIMVimentin7431VimentinCAI39485 VPS51VPS51, GARP complex subunit738Chromosome 11 open reading frame 2AAH07198Bait CEFIP (nt 966–2160) ACTN2Actinin α288α-Actinin-2 isoform 1NP_001094 FHL2Four and a half LIM domains 22274FHL2 isoform 5ABB73038 GYPCGlycophorin C2995Glycophorin-C isoform 1NP_002092 HSPB3Heat shock protein family B (small) member 38988Heat shock protein β-3NP_006299.1 IFITM1Interferon-induced transmembrane protein 18519Interferon-induced transmembrane protein 1AAH00897 MYL2Myosin light chain 24633cardiac myosin light chain 2AAA91832.1Bait CEFIP (nt 2160–3168) ACTN2Actinin α288α-Actinin-2 isoform 1NP_001094 FHL2Four and a half LIM domains 22274FHL2 isoform 5ABB73038 HSPB3Heat shock protein family B (small) member 38988Heat shock protein β-3NP_006299.1 MPC1Mitochondrial pyruvate carrier1 (brain protein 44-like protein)51660Brain protein 44-likeAAH00810 TAOK3TAO kinase 351347STE20-like kinaseAAF14559 Open table in a new tab To further analyze the interaction between FHL2 and CEFIP, we performed luciferase assays in the absence of FHL2 when CEFIP or CnA is either overexpressed or knocked down. FHL2 was 80% down-regulated by silencer siRNA. As reported earlier, knockdown of FHL2 increased NFAT-luciferase activity (Fig. 6G). Interestingly, simultaneous overexpression of CEFIP and down-regulation of FHL2 revealed a slight additive increase of luciferase activity (Fig. 6G). Conversely, knockdown of CEFIP abrogated the hypertrophic effect by the absence of FHL2 (Fig. 6H). However, overexpression of both CnA and CEFIP when FHL2 is knocked down had no significant effect compared with overexpression of CnA alone in the absence of FHL2 (Fig. 6G). Moreover, knockdown of CEFIP did not completely attenuate the activation of NFAT-luc due to the knockdown of FHL2 in the presence of CnA (Fig. 6H). Thus, it is unlikely that FHL2 and CEFIP function in a linear pathway. Instead, we hypothesize that CEFIP plays an independent role to fine-tune calcineurin/NFAT signaling in cardiomyocytes (Fig. 7). Here, we introduce CEFIP as a novel striated muscle-enriched sarcomeric z-disc protein. This previously uncharacterized protein appears to play an important role in cardiomyocyte hypertrophy via modulation of calcineurin-dependent signaling. Recently, the perception of the z-disc has experienced a transformation from the traditionally, merely mechanical role into a nodal point in cardiomyocyte signaling (1Frank D. Kuhn C. Katus H.A. Frey N. The sarcomeric Z-disc: a nodal point in signalling and disease.J. Mol. Med. 2006; 84: 446-468Crossref PubMed Scopus (190) Google Scholar) and a “hotspot” of cardiomyopathies. Several z-disc components have been discovered to participate in the processes of mechanical stress sensing and signal transduction (3Leber Y. Ruparelia A.A. Kirfel G. van der Ven P.F. Hoffmann B.

Because the function of CEFIP was largely unknown, we first applied a yeast two-hybrid screen using three independent protein fragments of CEFIP as baits in order to identify possible protein interaction partners. We identified FHL2 as a binding partner of CEFIP and could verify this interaction by co-immunoprecipitation and co-localization. Interestingly, at least two independent binding sites for FHL2 must exist on CEFIP, as two non-overlapping baits revealed this new interaction partner. FHL2, like CEFIP, is localized at the z-disc and highly enriched in the heart (22Chan K.K. Tsui S.K. Lee S.M. Luk S.C. Liew C.C. Fung K.P. Waye M.M. Lee C.Y.

Aims To estimate the normal serum AMH values and to assess the age-specific TT levels in men aged 30–70, we conducted the present population-based study. Methods A total of 831 healthy eligible men, aged 30–70 years, were recruited from Tehran Lipid and Glucose study cohort. Centiles for AMH were estimated according to the exponential normal 3-parameter model. The parametric method of Royston available in general software was applied for the first time to estimate the age-specific AMH and TT percentiles of 5th, 10th, 25th, 50th, 75th, 90th and 95th. Results Mean AMH level was 6.93, ranging from 0.1 to 40.1 ng/ml. Serum AMH concentrations followed a steady reduction with increasing age. Mean TT level was 4.8, ranging from 0.44 to 11.4 ng/ml. Discussion A measurable serum concentrations of AMH in healthy males throughout lifespan with variations, based on age, confirming a slight age-related AMH decline. Fractional polynomial (FP) regression models revealed that the mean and standard deviation (SD) of the TT were not associated with age, so the percentiles estimated were not age-specific. Conclusion We presented a nomogram of age-specific AMH values in a healthy cohort of Iranian men. This finding might have clinical importance in dealing hormonal disorders in men."

Long-term recovery from sepsis has garnered increasing attention recently, but a lack of suitable animal models impairs progress in this area. Our study, therefore, aimed to address the performance of the immune system in a survivable model of sepsis (cecal ligation and sepsis; CLP) for up to 28 d after the initial injury in humanized mice. Our model mimics human sepsis with weight loss and post-sepsis hypothermia. Within the first 7 d of sepsis, the M1 inflammatory cell subtype predominated, as evidenced by increased CD16 expression, but at 28 d, a mixed population of M1 and M2 inflammatory cells emerged, as evidenced by increased secretion of transforming growth factor TGFβ and CD206 expression. This change was accompanied by normalized production of interleukin (IL)-6, tumor necrosis factor TNFα and IL-10 at 28 d. Furthermore, the ability of MO to become regulatory DC or the frequency of endogenous DC were severely affected at 28 days. Thus, sepsis results in profound and persistent changes in the function of myeloid cells up to 28 days after CLP demonstrating the persistence of the new acquired immunological features long after resolution of the sepsis."
https://openalex.org/W2739235298,"G protein coupled receptor (GPCR) signalling covers three major mechanisms. GPCR agonist engagement allows for the G proteins to bind to the receptor leading to a classical downstream signalling cascade. The second mechanism is via the utilization of the β-arrestin signalling molecule and thirdly via transactivation dependent signalling. GPCRs can transactivate protein tyrosine kinase receptors (PTKR) to activate respective downstream signalling intermediates. In the past decade GPCR transactivation dependent signalling was expanded to show transactivation of serine/threonine kinase receptors (S/TKR). Kinase receptor transactivation enormously broadens the GPCR signalling paradigm. This work utilizes next generation RNA-sequencing to study the contribution of transactivation dependent signalling to total protease activated receptor (PAR)-1 signalling. Transactivation, assessed as gene expression, accounted for 50 percent of the total genes regulated by thrombin acting through PAR-1 in human coronary artery smooth muscle cells. GPCR transactivation of PTKRs is approximately equally important as the transactivation of the S/TKR with 209 and 177 genes regulated respectively, via either signalling pathway. This work shows that genome wide studies can provide powerful insights into GPCR mediated signalling pathways."
https://openalex.org/W2739382621,"It is known that the catabolism of branched-chain amino acids (BCAAs) in skeletal muscle is suppressed under normal and sedentary conditions but is promoted by exercise. BCAA catabolism in muscle tissues is regulated by the branched-chain α-keto acid (BCKA) dehydrogenase complex, which is inactivated by phosphorylation by BCKA dehydrogenase kinase (BDK). In the present study, we used muscle-specific BDK deficient mice (BDK-mKO mice) to examine the effect of uncontrolled BCAA catabolism on endurance exercise performance and skeletal muscle energy metabolism. Untrained control and BDK-mKO mice showed the same performance; however, the endurance performance enhanced by 2 weeks of running training was somewhat, but significantly less in BDK-mKO mice than in control mice. Skeletal muscle of BDK-mKO mice had low levels of glycogen. Metabolome analysis showed that BCAA catabolism was greatly enhanced in the muscle of BDK-mKO mice and produced branched-chain acyl-carnitine, which induced perturbation of energy metabolism in the muscle. These results suggest that the tight regulation of BCAA catabolism in muscles is important for homeostasis of muscle energy metabolism and, at least in part, for adaptation to exercise training."
https://openalex.org/W2735042890,"A number of oxidoreductases from the VAO/para-cresol methylhydroxylase flavoprotein family catalyze the oxidation of para-substituted phenols. One of the best-studied is vanillyl-alcohol oxidase (VAO) from the fungus Penicillium simplicissimum. For oxidation of phenols by VAO to occur, they must first be bound in the active site of the enzyme in their phenolate anion form. The crystal structure of VAO reveals that two tyrosine residues, Tyr-108 and Tyr-503, are positioned to facilitate this deprotonation. To investigate their role in catalysis, we created three VAO variants, Y108F, Y503F, and Y108F/Y503F, and studied their biochemical properties. Steady-state kinetics indicated that the presence of at least one of the tyrosine residues is essential for efficient catalysis by VAO. Stopped-flow kinetics revealed that the reduction of VAO by chavicol or vanillyl alcohol occurs at two different rates: kobs1, which corresponds to its reaction with the deprotonated form of the substrate, and kobs2, which corresponds to its reaction with the protonated form of the substrate. In Y108F, Y503F, and Y108F/Y503F, the relative contribution of kobs2 to the reduction is larger than in wild-type VAO, suggesting deprotonation is impaired in these variants. Binding studies disclosed that the competitive inhibitor isoeugenol is predominantly in its deprotonated form when bound to wild-type VAO, but predominantly in its protonated form when bound to the variants. These results indicate that Tyr-108 and Tyr-503 are responsible for the activation of substrates in VAO, providing new insights into the catalytic mechanism of VAO and related enzymes that oxidize para-substituted phenols."

To study the effect of cofactor regeneration on recombinant protein expression, NADH oxidase (noxE) was engineered in P. pastoris expressing lipase B (GSCALB). Expression of noxE in P. pastoris (GSCALBNOX) increased NAD+ levels by 85% with a concomitant reduction in NADH/NAD+ ratio of 67% compared to GSCALB. The change in the redox level positively influenced the methanol uptake rate and made 34% augment in CALB activity. The decline in NADH level (44%) by noxE expression had lowered the adenylate energy charge (AEC) and ATP level in GSCALBNOX. In order to regenerate ATP in GSCALBNOX, adenylate kinase (ADK1) gene from S. cerevisiae S288c was co—expressed. Expression of ADK1 showed a remarkable increase in AEC and co—expression of both the genes synergistically improved CALB activity. This study shows the importance of maintenance of cellular redox homeostasis and adenylate energy charge during recombinant CALB expression in P. pastoris."
https://openalex.org/W2736006777,"Remnants of ancient transposable elements (TEs) are abundant in mammalian genomes. These sequences contain multiple regulatory motifs and hence are capable of influencing expression of host genes. TEs are known to be released from epigenetic repression and can become transcriptionally active in cancer. Such activation could also lead to lineage-inappropriate activation of oncogenes, as previously described in lymphomas. However, there are few reports of this mechanism occurring in non-blood cancers. Here, we re-analyzed whole transcriptome data from a large cohort of patients with colon cancer, compared to matched normal colon control samples, to detect genes or transcripts ectopically expressed through activation of TE promoters. Among many such transcripts, we identified six where the affected gene has described role in cancer and where the TE-driven gene mRNA is expressed in primary colon cancer, but not normal matched tissue, and confirmed expression in colon cancer-derived cell lines. We further characterized a TE-gene chimeric transcript involving the Interleukin 33 (IL-33) gene (termed LTR-IL-33), that is ectopically expressed in a subset of colon cancer samples through the use of an endogenous retroviral long terminal repeat (LTR) promoter of the MSTD family. The LTR-IL-33 chimeric transcript encodes a novel shorter isoform of the protein, which is missing the initial N-terminus (including many conserved residues) of Native IL-33. In vitro studies showed that LTR-IL-33 expression is required for optimal CRC cell line growth as 3D colonospheres. Taken together, these data demonstrate the significance of TEs as regulators of aberrant gene expression in colon cancer."
https://openalex.org/W2736014138,"Synaptic strength at excitatory synapses is determined by the presence of glutamate receptors (i.e. AMPA, NMDA, and kainate receptors) at the synapse. Synaptic strength is modulated by multiple factors including assembly of different receptor subunits, interaction with auxiliary subunits, and post-translational modifications of either the receptors or their auxiliary subunits. Using mass spectrometry, we found that the intracellular region of neuropilin and tolloid-like proteins (Neto) 1 and Neto2, the auxiliary subunits of kainate receptor (KARs), are phosphorylated by multiple kinases in vitro. Specifically, Neto2 was phosphorylated at serine 409 (Ser-409) by Ca2+/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase II (CaMKII) and protein kinase A (PKA) both in vitro and in heterologous cells. Interestingly, we observed a substantial increase in Neto2 Ser-409 phosphorylation in the presence of CaMKII, and this phosphorylation was reduced in the presence of the KAR subunit GluK1 or GluK2. We also found endogenous phosphorylation of Neto2 at Ser-409 in the brain. Moreover, Neto2 Ser-409 phosphorylation inhibited synaptic targeting of GluK1 because, unlike WT Neto2 and the phosphodeficient mutant Neto2 S409A, the Neto2 S409D phosphomimetic mutant impeded GluK1 trafficking to synapses.

Neurosci. 2014; 34: 622-628Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). Although an interdependence of Neto1/2 and KARs on synaptic localization has been shown, underlying molecular mechanisms still need to be understood. Neto1 and Neto2 are single-pass transmembrane proteins containing an extracellular region with two CUB domains, an LDL domain, and an intracellular C terminus. There are a few reports that highlight the function of these specific domains: CUB domains mediate interactions with KAR subunits (4Tang M. Pelkey K.A. Ng D. Ivakine E. McBain C.J. Salter M.W. McInnes R.R. Neto1 is an auxiliary subunit of native synaptic kainate receptors.J. Neurosci. 2011; 31: 10009-10018Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar), the LDL domain affects channel kinetics (7Fisher J.L. Mott D.D. The auxiliary subunits Neto1 and Neto2 reduce voltage-dependent inhibition of recombinant kainate receptors.J. Neurosci. 2012; 32: 12928-12933Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar), and the intracellular domain is important both for modifying channel properties and for regulating synaptic abundance of KARs (7Fisher J.L.

In this study, we found that the intracellular region of Neto1 and Neto2 can be phosphorylated by various kinases in vitro. We characterized phosphorylation at one of the residues on Neto2, Ser-409, by different biochemical methods and found that this residue is phosphorylated by CaMKII and PKA. We also demonstrated endogenous phosphorylation of this residue in the brain. Additionally, we found that Neto2 inhibits synaptic targeting of GluK1 when phosphorylated at Ser-409. This is the first report showing that Neto1 and Neto2 can be phosphorylated and how Neto phosphorylation regulates synaptic targeting of KARs. Future studies on the other identified phosphorylation residues will further our understanding of KAR trafficking by Netos. It is well established that the function and trafficking of synaptic proteins are modulated by different post-translational modifications such as phosphorylation. The intracellular C termini of Neto1 and Neto2 contain several serine and threonine residues that can be potentially phosphorylated. We began by testing whether Neto proteins can be phosphorylated in vitro. We expressed and purified the C termini as GST-Neto1 and GST-Neto2 fusion proteins and used these in an in vitro kinase assay. GST-Neto1 and GST-Neto2 were incubated with three different kinases, CaMKII, PKA, and PKC, along with [γ-32P]ATP in the kinase reaction buffer. The autoradiogram shows that the C termini of both Neto1 and Neto2 are phosphorylated by CaMKII, PKA, and PKC (Fig. 1, A–C). Subsequently, we identified the residues of Neto1 and Neto2 that can be phosphorylated by the specific kinases using mass spectrometry. We found that both Neto1 and Neto2 can be phosphorylated at multiple residues (highlighted in red) by different kinases (Fig. 2, A and B). In certain regions of the sequence, it was difficult to distinguish the specific residue due to the high abundance of Ser/Thr residues. For those cases, both residues are highlighted in blue. All three kinases, PKA, PKC, and CaMKII, phosphorylated multiple residues on both proteins. The C termini of Neto1 and Neto2 show a certain degree of sequence similarity, and we observed that some phosphorylated residues are common for both Neto1 and Neto2, and others are specific for each of the proteins (Fig. 2C). The mass spectrometry analysis shows that Neto2 is phosphorylated at Ser-409 by both CaMKII (Fig. 3A) and PKA (Fig. 3B). To evaluate the phosphorylation at Ser-409, we generated and characterized a phosphorylation state-specific antibody, Ser(P)-409. We mutated Ser-409 to Ala (S409A) and tested the specificity of the antibody in an in vitro kinase assay using purified GST-Neto2 (WT or S409A). Upon blotting with Ser(P)-409 antibody, a specific signal was observed only with GST-Neto2 WT when it was incubated with either CaMKII (Fig. 3C) or PKA (Fig. 3D). This experiment showed the specificity of the custom Ser(P)-409 antibody along with confirming that Neto2 is phosphorylated at Ser-409 directly by CaMKII and PKA. Subsequently, we tested the effect of CaMKII or PKA on full-length Neto2. We co-transfected COS-7 cells with Neto2 and a constitutively active mutant of CaMKII (T286D) or treated Neto2-transfected cells with forskolin to activate PKA. We observed a substantial increase in Neto2 Ser-409 phosphorylation both in the presence of CaMKII T286D and with forskolin treatment in heterologous cells using Ser(P)-409 antibody (Fig. 4, A–D), demonstrating the CaMKII- and PKA-mediated phosphorylation of Neto2 Ser-409 in situ. We subsequently immunoprecipitated Neto2 from brain lysates of young WT animals (age P1–P2), which show a high expression of the protein (14Vernon C.G. Swanson G.T. Neto2 assembles with kainate receptors in DRG neurons during development and modulates neurite outgrowth in adult sensory neurons.J. Neurosci. 2017; 37: 3352-3363Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar), and confirmed that Neto2 is endogenously phosphorylated at Ser-409 in the brain by immunoblotting with the custom Ser(P)-409 antibody (Fig. 4E). Phosphorylation at Ser-409 has also been previously reported in two independent proteomic studies using HeLa cells and the brain (15Huttlin E.L. Jedrychowski M.P. Elias J.E. Goswami T. Rad R.

Sumioka A. Morimoto-Tomita M. Kim K.S. Straub C. Burlingame A.L. Howe J.R. Tomita S. A transmembrane accessory subunit that modulates kainate-type glutamate receptors.Neuron. 2009; 61: 385-396Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (179) Google Scholar) and affects both the channel gating and synaptic targeting properties of different subunits of KARs. Therefore, we tested whether Neto2 Ser-409 phosphorylation is modulated in the presence of KARs. Although we found that Neto2 Ser-409 phosphorylation increased considerably in the presence of CaMKII T286D, no such increase was observed when either KAR subunit GluK1 or GluK2 was co-expressed (Fig. 5, A and B). We probed with the respective antibodies to confirm that both Neto2 and KAR subunits are being expressed and found no apparent difference in their expression under different conditions (supplemental Fig. S1). We subsequently tested whether binding between GluK1 and Neto2 is affected by this phosphorylation. However, we did not find any differences in the binding ability of Neto2 WT; Neto2 S409A, the phosphodeficient mutant; or Neto2 S409D, the phosphomimetic mutant (Fig. 5C). We have previously shown that Neto2 induces synaptic targeting of GluK1 (9Sheng N. Shi Y.S. Lomash R.M. Roche K.W. Nicoll R.A. Neto auxiliary proteins control both the trafficking and biophysical properties of the kainate receptor GluK1.Elife. 2015; 4: e11682Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar), and now we have demonstrated that Neto2 is phosphorylated at Ser-409 in the brain. So, we next tested whether phosphorylation of Neto2 Ser-409 affects KAR-mediated synaptic transmission. We co-expressed GluK1 and Neto2 (WT, S409A, or S409D) in CA1 neurons of rat hippocampal slices through biolistic transfection. Subsequently, we measured synaptic responses at −70 mV by dual whole-cell recordings. As previously reported, we found a substantial increase in GluK1 synaptic responses in the presence of Neto2 WT (Fig. 6A). Co-expression of GluK1 with the phosphodeficient mutant Neto2 S409A also showed a similar increase in synaptic responses (Fig. 6B). By contrast, there was significantly less enhancement of synaptic currents when co-expressed with Neto2 S409D, the phosphomimetic mutant (Fig. 6, C and D). We have previously shown that Neto2 itself does not regulate AMPAR-mediated synaptic transmission (9Sheng N. Shi Y.S. Lomash R.M. Roche K.W. Nicoll R.A. Neto auxiliary proteins control both the trafficking and biophysical properties of the kainate receptor GluK1.Elife. 2015; 4: e11682Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). Taken together, these results show that when Neto2 is phosphorylated at Ser-409 the synaptic targeting of GluK1 is inhibited. Although there have been a number of studies showing that Neto1 and Neto2 interact with and regulate the trafficking properties of KARs, the precise mechanisms underlying this regulation are not fully understood. Our findings show a molecular mechanism by which phosphorylation of the Neto2 C terminus regulates GluK1 synaptic targeting. We have shown that the intracellular region of Neto1 and Neto2 can be phosphorylated by different kinases at specific residues in vitro. Furthermore, we have demonstrated that the Neto2 C terminus can be phosphorylated at Ser-409 by two different kinases, CaMKII and PKA, both of which are widely expressed in the brain and regulate synaptic plasticity by modulating multiple synaptic proteins including glutamate receptors (17Lussier M.P. Sanz-Clemente A. Roche K.W. Dynamic regulation of N-methyl-d-aspartate (NMDA) and α-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methyl-4-isoxazolepropionic acid (AMPA) receptors by posttranslational modifications.J. Biol. Chem. 2015; 290: 28596-28603Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar). We further characterized Neto2 Ser-409 phosphorylation and found that it is significantly increased in the presence of constitutively active CaMKII or PKA activated by forskolin treatment. We were able to confirm endogenous phosphorylation of Neto2 Ser-409 in the brain, suggesting a potential role in vivo. Interestingly, we observed reduced phosphorylation of this residue in the presence of CaMKII when Neto2 was co-expressed with either GluK1 or GluK2. It is possible that the reduced Neto2 Ser-409 phosphorylation observed in the presence of KAR subunits is due to competition with KAR subunits, which are also substrates for different kinases (18Nasu-Nishimura Y.

We tested using different mutants whether phosphorylation has any effect on binding with GluK1 but found no difference. This is possibly because the binding between the two proteins is spread through a large interface involving multiple domains of Neto2 (12Tang M. Ivakine E. Mahadevan V. Salter M.W. McInnes R.R. Neto2 interacts with the scaffolding protein GRIP and regulates synaptic abundance of kainate receptors.PLoS One. 2012; 7: e51433Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar) and thus may not be easy to alter. Importantly, we found that Neto2 Ser-409 phosphorylation affects synaptic targeting of GluK1. Upon co-expression of GluK1 with Neto2 S409D, a phosphomimetic mutation, we found reduced GluK1 at the synapses. The remaining enhancement seen with Neto2 S409D is presumably due to an incomplete blockade of synaptic trafficking, although we cannot completely exclude the possibility of some unrelated mechanism. We, along with others, have previously shown that Neto2 is essential for synaptic targeting of GluK1 to synapses (9Sheng N. Shi Y.S. Lomash R.M. Roche K.W. Nicoll R.A.

It has been reported that Neto2 interacts with the scaffolding protein glutamate receptor-interacting protein and regulates synaptic localization of KARs (12Tang M. Ivakine E. Mahadevan V. Salter M.W. McInnes R.R. Neto2 interacts with the scaffolding protein GRIP and regulates synaptic abundance of kainate receptors.PLoS One. 2012; 7: e51433Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar) and that deletion of the C terminus of either Neto1 or Neto2 abrogates synaptic targeting of GluK1 (9Sheng N.

Neto auxiliary proteins control both the trafficking and biophysical properties of the kainate receptor GluK1.Elife. 2015; 4: e11682Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). It is also well established that Neto2 can directly interact with GluK1 (21Copits B.A. Robbins J.S. Frausto S. Swanson G.T.

Neurosci. 2011; 31: 7334-7340Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar), and Neto2 affects the levels of synaptic KARs and vice versa; however, no underlying mechanism has been described. Analogous to the role Netos play in regulating KARs, TARPs are AMPAR auxiliary subunits whose role in modulating AMPAR trafficking and gating has been characterized extensively. It has been shown that CaMKII-mediated phosphorylation of the intracellular C termini of TARPs regulates AMPAR-mediated synaptic transmission (22Sumioka A. Yan D. Tomita S. TARP phosphorylation regulates synaptic AMPA receptors through lipid bilayers.Neuron. 2010; 66: 755-767Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar, 23Park J. Chávez A.E.

Additionally, PKA-mediated phosphorylation of the C terminus of stargazin, one of the TARPs, is known to inhibit its binding to the scaffolding protein PSD-95, and the corresponding phosphomimetic mutant reduces synaptic AMPARs (24Chetkovich D.M. Chen L. Stocker T.J. Nicoll R.A. Bredt D.S.

It has also been shown that the phosphomimetic mutant of stargazin alters the NMDAR-dependent long-term depression component of synaptic plasticity, whereas wild-type or phosphodeficient stargazin did not have any effect (26Tomita S. Stein V. Stocker T.J. Nicoll R.A. Bredt D.S. Bidirectional synaptic plasticity regulated by phosphorylation of stargazin-like TARPs.Neuron. 2005; 45: 269-277Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (266) Google Scholar). Our observation that Neto2 Ser-409 phosphorylation alters synaptic targeting of GluK1 explains such a molecular mechanism for KARs by which phosphorylation of auxiliary subunits affects receptor trafficking. Our observations of less GluK1 synaptic targeting in the presence of Neto2 S409D and reduced Ser-409 phosphorylation in the presence of KAR subunits suggest that Neto2 phosphorylated at Ser-409 helps restrict KAR from the synapses due to altered trafficking. Thus, phosphorylation of Neto2 Ser-409 is a possible regulatory mechanism adopted for restricting GluK1 from synapses. In conclusion, this is the first report showing a molecular mechanism by which Neto2 phosphorylation might control KAR synaptic content. Additionally, we identified multiple other phosphorylation sites in the C termini of Neto1 and Neto2, and deciphering their role will further our understanding of KAR synaptic regulation by Netos. HA-GluK1 and full-length Neto2 were generated as described previously (9Sheng N. Shi Y.S. Lomash R.M. Roche K.W. Nicoll R.A. Neto auxiliary proteins control both the trafficking and biophysical properties of the kainate receptor GluK1.Elife. 2015; 4: e11682Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). GluK2 in pRK5 mammalian expression vector was obtained as a gift from Dr. P. Seeburg. GST-GluA1 loop1 and GST-GluA1 C-tail have been described previously (27Lussier M.P. Gu X. Lu W. Roche K.W. Casein kinase 2 phosphorylates GluA1 and regulates its surface expression.Eur. J. Neurosci. 2014; 39: 1148-1158Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). C-terminal tails of mouse Neto1 (amino acids 363–533) and rat Neto2 (amino acids 368–525) were cloned into pGEX4T1 in EcoRI and NotI sites to generate GST fusion proteins. Point mutations were generated using a QuikChange mutagenesis kit (Agilent Technologies), and the positive clone was confirmed by sequencing. Different antibodies used in the study were as follows: α-GST (A190-122A, Bethyl Laboratories; 1:25,000), α-CaMKII (C6974, Thermo Scientific; 1:1000), α-HA clone 3F10 (Roche Applied Science), α-GluK2 clone NL9 (Millipore), α-Neto2 (for immunoblotting, HPA013180, Sigma; 1:1000; for immunoprecipitation and experiments from the brain, ab109288, Abcam). The phosphorylation state-specific antibody was generated by New England Peptide. Rabbits were immunized with the synthetic phosphopeptide Ac-REKEIpSADLA-amide (where pS is phosphoserine). Serum was collected and affinity-purified using a column immobilized with the phosphopeptide as the antigen. For immunoblotting with this antibody, the membranes were blocked in 5% PhosphoBLOCKER (Cell Biolabs, Inc.) at room temperature for 1 h and incubated with the primary antibody at 4 °C overnight at a concentration of 1 μg/μl and secondary antibody at room temperature for 1 h, both diluted in 1% PhosphoBLOCKER. The protein was expressed in Escherichia coli BL21 cells by induction with 0.5 mm isopropyl 1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside at 37 °C for 3 h. The induced bacterial pellet was resuspended in buffer (20 mm Tris-Cl, pH 8.0, 150 mm NaCl, 5 mm EDTA, 100 mm DTT, and protease inhibitors). To lyse the bacterial cells, they were sonicated followed by incubation with 1% Triton X-100 for 45 min at 4 °C. Subsequently, the lysate was centrifuged at 18,000 × g for 30 min at 4 °C to separate the soluble protein, which was then incubated with glutathione-Sepharose 4B beads (Amersham Biosciences) for 2 h at 4 °C. The nonspecific protein was removed by washes with PBS. The protein bound to beads was resuspended as a 50:50 slurry in PBS containing protease inhibitors. The in vitro kinase assays were performed as described previously (28Bemben M.A. Shipman S.L. Hirai T. Herring B.E. Li Y. Badger 2nd, J.D. Nicoll R.A. Diamond J.S. Roche K.W. CaMKII phosphorylation of neuroligin-1 regulates excitatory synapses.Nat. Neurosci. 2014; 17: 56-64Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). The protein bound on the glutathione beads was incubated with the respective kinases in reaction buffer at 30 °C for 30 min. For PKA, reactions were incubated in 10 mm HEPES, pH 7.0, 20 mm MgCl2, 50 μm ATP, and 1 pmol of [γ-32P]ATP (3,000 Ci mmol−1) with 50 ng of purified PKA catalytic subunit (Promega). For PKC, reactions were performed in 20 mm HEPES, pH 7.4, 1.67 mm CaCl2, 1 mm DTT, 10 mm MgCl2, 50 μm ATP, and 1 pmol of [γ-32P]ATP (3,000 Ci mmol−1) with 10 ng of purified PKC (Promega). No lipid activators of PKC were included in the assay. For CaMKII, the assay was performed in 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 10 mm MgCl2, 0.5 mm DTT, 0.1 mm EDTA, 2.4 μm calmodulin, 2 mm CaCl2, 100 μm ATP, and 1 pmol of [γ-32P]ATP (3,000 Ci mmol−1) with 25 ng of recombinant CaMKII-α (Calbiochem). The reaction was terminated by boiling samples in SDS sample buffer at 95 °C for 10 min. The proteins were resolved by SDS-PAGE and visualized by autoradiography. For samples analyzed by immunoblotting, the proteins were transferred onto PVDF membranes and probed by the indicated antibodies. For identifying phosphorylated residues by mass spectrometry, gels were stained with Coomassie Brilliant Blue, and the respective protein band was excised for further analysis. The in-gel samples were reduced with tris(2-carboxyethyl)phosphine, alkylated with N-ethylmaleimide, and digested with trypsin overnight at 37 °C. Tryptic peptides were desalted first and analyzed on an Orbitrap Elite mass spectrometer (Thermo Scientific) coupled to an Ultimate 3000 HPLC (Thermo-Dionex) via an Easy-Spray ion source (Thermo Scientific). Peptides were separated on an ES802 Easy-Spray column (Thermo Scientific; 75-μm inner diameter, 25-cm length, 3-μm C18 beads). A 40-min linear gradient of 2–27% mobile phase B (mobile phase A, 2% acetonitrile and 0.1% formic acid; mobile phase B, 98% acetonitrile and 0.1% formic acid) was used. The flow rate was set at 300 nl/min. The Thermo Scientific Orbitrap Elite mass spectrometer was operated in positive nanoelectrospray mode. The resolution of the survey scan was set at 60,000 at m/z 400 with a target value of 1 × 106 ions. The m/z range for MS scans was 300–1600. The collision-induced dissociation MS/MS data were acquired in data-dependent mode. The top 10 most abundant ions were selected for product ion analysis. The isolation window for MS/MS fragmentation was set to 2.0 Da. Dynamic exclusion was 12 s, and early expiration was enabled. Xcalibur RAW files were converted to peak list files in mgf format using Mascot Distiller (version 2.5.1). The database search was performed using Mascot Daemon (2.5.1) against a house-built database that contains the Neto1 and Neto 2 sequences and the NCBInr human database (10,962 sequences; 5,416,110 residues). The following database search parameters were used: enzyme, semitrypsin; variable modifications, N-ethylmaleimide (Cys), oxidation (Met), phospho (Ser/Thr), phospho (Tyr); peptide mass tolerance, ±10 ppm; fragment mass tolerance, ±0.3 Da. The MS/MS spectra of all phosphopeptides detected in the database search were manually checked. The phosphorylation sites listed were identified in at least two independent experiments. The sites identified only in one experiment have not been highlighted. COS-7 cells were transfected with the indicated plasmids using Lipofectamine 2000 reagent (Invitrogen). 40 h after transfection, cells were washed in PBS, lysed directly with SDS-PAGE sample buffer, sonicated, and boiled at 95 °C for 10 min. The proteins were resolved by SDS-PAGE and subjected to Western blotting using the indicated antibodies. For testing change in phosphorylation upon forskolin treatment (20 μm; 30 min; 37 °C), Neto2 was immunoprecipitated using Neto2 antibody to enrich the protein. The amount of phosphorylation in different conditions was quantitated by densitometry using ImageJ. Statistical significance was calculated using an unpaired t test. Pups from WT animals (P1–P2) were dissected, and the brains were homogenized in buffer containing protease and phosphatase inhibitors. The crude synaptosomal fraction was isolated and detergent-solubilized in 1% Triton X-100 as described previously (28Bemben M.A. Shipman S.L. Hirai T. Herring B.E. Li Y. Badger 2nd, J.D. Nicoll R.A. Diamond J.S. Roche K.W. CaMKII phosphorylation of neuroligin-1 regulates excitatory synapses.Nat. Neurosci. 2014; 17: 56-64Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). Different concentrations of the P2 solubilized fraction were immunoprecipitated with anti-Neto2 antibody, and the pulled down complexes were immunoblotted with the indicated antibodies. HA-GluK1 and Neto2 (WT or mutants) were co-expressed in HEK cells using PEI. The lysates were immunoprecipitated with HA-agarose (Sigma), and the bound Neto2 was detected by probing with Neto2 antibody. Immunoprecipitation of GluK1 was confirmed by probing with HA antibody. Organotypic hippocampal slice cultures were made from P6–P8 rats. All experiments were performed in accordance with established protocols approved by the University of California San Francisco Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee. Transfections were carried out on day in vitro 2 after culturing using a Helios Gene Gun (Bio-Rad) with 1-μm DNA-coated gold particles. When biolistically expressing two plasmids, gold particles were coated with equal amounts of each plasmid, and plasmids always expressed different fluorescent markers. Observed frequency of co-expression was nearly 100%. Slices were maintained at 34 °C with changes of media every other day. On day in vitro 8, dual whole-cell recordings in the CA1 area were done by simultaneously recording responses from a fluorescent transfected neuron as well as a neighboring untransfected control neuron. Pyramidal neurons were identified by morphology and location. Series resistance was monitored online, and recordings in which series increased to >30 megaohms or varied by >50% between neurons were discarded. Dual whole-cell recordings measuring evoked EPSCs used artificial cerebrospinal fluid, bubbled with 95% O2 and 5% CO2, consisting of 119 mm NaCl, 2.5 mm KCl, 4 mm CaCl2, 4 mm MgSO4, 1 mm NaH2PO4, 26.2 mm NaHCO3, and 11 mm glucose. 100 μm picrotoxin was added to block inhibitory currents, and 4 μm 2-chloroadenosine was used to control epileptiform activity. The intracellular solution contained 135 mm CsMeSO4, 8 mm NaCl, 10 mm HEPES, 0.3 mm EGTA, 5 mm QX314-Cl, 4 mm MgATP, 0.3 mm Na3GTP, and 0.1 mm spermine. A bipolar stimulation electrode was placed in the stratum radiatum, and responses were evoked at 0.2 Hz. As the ratio of synaptic current amplitudes between experimental and control neurons is independent of the stimulation intensity (29Herring B.E. Nicoll R.A. Kalirin and Trio proteins serve critical roles in excitatory synaptic transmission and LTP.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2016; 113: 2264-2269Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar), any evoking intensity was applied only when stable synaptic currents were observed. Peak AMPAR and KAR currents were recorded at −70 mV. All these data were analyzed offline with custom software (Igor Pro, Wavemetrics). Responses were collected with a Multiclamp 700A amplifier (Axon Instruments), filtered at 2 kHz, and digitized at 10 kHz. Significance of evoked dual whole-cell recordings compared with controls was determined using the two-tailed Wilcoxon signed rank sum test. For all experiments involving unpaired data, a Mann-Whitney U test with Bonferroni correction for multiple comparisons was used. Data analysis was carried out in Igor Pro, Excel (Microsoft), and GraphPad Prism (GraphPad Software). R. M. L. performed all biochemistry experiments and data analysis. R. M. L. and K. W.

https://openalex.org/W2735261229,"Background Recombinant human growth hormone (rhGH) treatment in children is usually prescribed using actual body weight. This may result in inappropriately high doses in obese children. Methods Retrospective audit of all paediatric patients treated with rhGH 2010–14 at a tertiary paediatric hospital in the UK. Change in height SDS and IGF-I SDS during the first year of treatment was stratified by initial BMI SDS in a mixed cohort, and a subgroup of GH deficient (GHD) patients. Alternative doses for those BMI SDS ≥2.0 (Obese) were calculated using BSA, IBW and LBW. Results 354 patients (133 female) received rhGH, including 213 (60.2%) with GHD. Obesity was present in 40 patients (11.3%) of the unselected cohort, and 32 (15.0%) of the GHD cohort. For GHD patients, gain in height SDS was directly related to BMI SDS, except in obese patients (p<0.05). For both the entire cohort, and GHD patients only, IGF-1 SDS was significantly higher in obese patients (p<0.0001 for both groups). Cross sectional data identified 265 children receiving rhGH, 81 (30.5%) with a BMI-SDS ≥1.75. Alternate prescribing strategies for rhGH prescribing in obese patients suggest a saving of 27% - 38% annually. Conclusions Gain in IGF-I SDS is greater in obese children, and is likely to be related to relatively higher doses of rhGH. Additional gain in height was not achieved at the higher doses administered to obese children. Alternative dosing strategies in the obese patient population should be examined in rigorous clinical trials."

The purpose of this study is to investigate the response of physiological and morphological acclimation of two shrubs Haloxylon ammodendron and Calligonum mongolicunl to variations in irrigation intervals. Methodology/Principal findings The irrigation frequency was set as 1-, 2-, 4-, 8- and 12-week intervals respectively from March to October during 2012–2014 to investigate the response of physiological and morphological acclimation of two desert shrubs Haloxylon ammodendron and Calligonum mongolicunl to variations in the irrigation system. The irrigation interval significantly affected the individual-scale carbon acquisition and biomass allocation pattern of both species. Under good water conditions (1- and 2-week intervals), carbon assimilation was significantly higher than other treatments; while, under water shortage conditions (8- and 12-week intervals), there was much defoliation; and under moderate irrigation intervals (4 weeks), the assimilative organs grew gently with almost no defoliation occurring. Conclusion/Significance Both studied species maintained similar ecophysiologically adaptive strategies, while C. mongolicunl was more sensitive to drought stress because of its shallow root system and preferential belowground allocation of resources. A moderate irrigation interval of 4 weeks was a suitable pattern for both plants since it not only saved water but also met the water demands of the plants."
https://openalex.org/W2737788605,"The Proxy Mobile IPv6 (PMIPv6) is a network-based mobility management protocol that allows a Mobile Node(MN) connected to the PMIPv6 domain to move from one network to another without changing the assigned IPv6 address. The user authentication procedure in this protocol is not standardized, but many smartcard based authentication schemes have been proposed. Recently, Alizadeh et al. proposed an authentication scheme for the PMIPv6. However, it could allow an attacker to derive an encryption key that must be securely shared between MN and the Mobile Access Gate(MAG). As a result, outsider adversary can derive MN's identity, password and session key. In this paper, we analyze Alizadeh et al.'s scheme regarding security and propose an enhanced authentication scheme that uses a dynamic identity to satisfy anonymity. Furthermore, we use BAN logic to show that our scheme can successfully generate and communicate with the inter-entity session key."
https://openalex.org/W2949189046,"Epidemics of influenza A vary greatly in size and age distribution of cases, and this variation is attributed to varying levels of pre-existing immunity. Recent studies have shown that antibody-mediated immune responses are more cross-reactive than previously believed, and shape patterns of humoral immunity to influenza A viruses over long periods. Here we quantify antibody responses to the hemagglutinin subunit 1 (HA1) across a range of subtypes using protein microarray analysis of cross-sectional serological surveys carried out in the Netherlands before and after the A/2009 (H1N1) pandemic. We find significant associations of responses, both within and between subtypes. Interestingly, substantial overall reactivity is observed to HA1 of avian H7N7 and H9N2 viruses. Seroprevalence of H7N7 correlates with antibody titers to A/1968 (H3N2), and is highest in persons born between 1954 and 1969. Seroprevalence of H9N2 is high across all ages, and correlates strongly with A/1957 (H2N2). This correlation is most pronounced in A/2009 (H1N1) infected persons born after 1968 who have never encountered A/1957 (H2N2)-like viruses. We conclude that heterosubtypic antibody cross-reactivity, both between human subtypes and between human and nonhuman subtypes, is common in the human population."
https://openalex.org/W2735587480,"To systematically survey existing definitions, concepts, and criteria of clinical research quality, both developed by stakeholder groups as well as in the medical literature. This study serves as a first step in the development of a comprehensive framework for the quality of clinical research.We systematically and in duplicate searched definitions, concepts and criteria of clinical research quality on websites of stakeholders in clinical research until no further insights emerged and in MEDLINE up to February 2015. Stakeholders included governmental bodies, regulatory agencies, the pharmaceutical industry, academic and commercial contract research organizations, initiatives, research ethics committees, patient organizations and funding agencies from 13 countries. Data synthesis involved descriptive and qualitative analyses following the Framework Method on definitions, concepts, and criteria of clinical research quality. Descriptive codes were applied and grouped into clusters to identify common and stakeholder-specific quality themes.Stakeholder concepts on how to assure quality throughout study conduct or articles on quality assessment tools were common, generally with no a priori definition of the term quality itself. We identified a total of 20 explicit definitions of clinical research quality including varying quality dimensions and focusing on different stages in the clinical research process. Encountered quality dimensions include ethical conduct, patient safety/rights/priorities, internal validity, precision of results, generalizability or external validity, scientific and societal relevance, transparency and accessibility of information, research infrastructure and sustainability. None of the definitions appeared to be comprehensive either in terms of quality dimensions, research stages, or stakeholder perspectives.Clinical research quality is often discussed but rarely defined. A framework defining clinical research quality across stakeholders' individual perspectives is desirable to facilitate discussion, assessment, and improvement of quality at all stages of clinical research."
https://openalex.org/W2736109855,"We examine whether people are more honest in public than in private. In a laboratory experiment, we have subjects roll dice and report outcomes either in public or in private. Higher reports yield more money and lies cannot be detected. We also elicit subjects' ethical mindsets and their expectations about others' reports. We find that outcome-minded subjects lie less in public to conform with their expectations about others' reports. Ironically, these expectations are false. Rule-minded subjects, in turn, do not respond to public scrutiny. These findings challenge the common faith in public scrutiny to promote ethical behavior. While public scrutiny eventually increases honesty, this effect is contingent on people's mindsets and expectations."

Nephroprotective effects of the anesthetic xenon on ischemia-reperfusion injury were found in several experimental studies.We aimed to explore whether xenon anesthesia can reduce renal damage in humans undergoing partial nephrectomy and to gather pilot data of possible nephroprotection in these patients.A prospective randomized, single-blinded, controlled study.Single-center, University Hospital of Aachen, Germany between July 2013-October 2015.Forty-six patients with regular renal function undergoing partial nephrectomy.Patients were randomly assigned to receive xenon- (n = 23) or isoflurane (n = 23) anesthesia.Primary outcome was the maximum postoperative glomerular filtration rate (GFR) decline within seven days after surgery. Secondary outcomes included intraoperative and tumor-related data, assessment of further kidney injury markers, adverse events and optional determination of renal function after 3-6 months.Unexpected radical nephrectomy was performed in 5 patients, thus they were excluded from the per-protocol analysis, but included in the intention-to-treat analysis. The maximum postoperative GFR decline was attenuated by 45% in the xenon-group (10.9 ml min-1 1.73 cm-2 versus 19.7 ml min-1 1.73 cm-2 in the isoflurane group), but without significance (P = 0.084). Occurrence of adverse events was reduced (P = 0.003) in the xenon group. Renal function was similar among the groups after 3-6 months.Xenon anesthesia was feasible and safe in patients undergoing partial nephrectomy with regard to postoperative renal function. We found no significant effect on early renal function but less adverse events in the xenon group. Larger randomized controlled studies in more heterogeneous collectives are required, to confirm or refute the possible clinical benefit on renal function by xenon.ClinicalTrials.gov NCT01839084 and EudraCT 2012-005698-30."
https://openalex.org/W2734323170,"The benefit of aspirin use after coronary artery bypass graft surgery has been well proven. However, the effect of preoperative aspirin use in patients undergoing off-pump coronary artery bypass graft surgery (OPCAB) has not been evaluated sufficiently. To evaluate platelet function changes during OPCAB due to preoperative aspirin use, we conducted a randomized controlled trial using flow cytometry and the Multiplate® analyzer. Forty-eight patients scheduled for elective OPCAB were randomized to the aspirin continuation (100 mg/day until operative day) and discontinuation (4 days before the operative day) groups. Platelet function was measured using the platelet activation markers CD62P, CD63, and PAC-1 by flow cytometry, and platelet aggregation was measured using the Multiplate® analyzer, after the induction of anesthesia (baseline), at the end of the operation, and 24 and 48 h postoperatively. Findings of conventional coagulation assays, thromboelastography by ROTEM® assays, and postoperative bleeding—related clinical outcomes were compared between groups. No significant change in CD62P, CD63, or PAC-1 was observed at the end of the operation or 24 or 48 h postoperatively compared with baseline in either group. The area under the curve for arachidonic acid—stimulated platelet aggregation, measured by the Multiplate® analyzer, was significantly smaller in the aspirin continuation group (P < 0.01). However, chest tube drainage and intraoperative and postoperative transfusion requirements did not differ between groups. Our study showed that preoperative use of aspirin for OPCAB did not affect perioperative platelet activation, but it impaired platelet aggregation, which did not affect postoperative bleeding, by arachidonic acid."
https://openalex.org/W2734660399,"The circadian system has been regarded as a limit cycle oscillator constructed by the integrated interaction of clock genes and proteins. Here, we investigated a mammalian circadian oscillation geometrically before and after a perturbation. We detected the singular point and transition from a type 1 to type 0 phase response curve (PRC) and determined the embedding dimension to show how many variables are needed to describe the limit cycle oscillation and relaxation process after a perturbation. As a perturbation, forskolin (FK) was administered to Rat-1 cells expressing the Per2::luc gene. By broadly and finely changing the phase and strength of the perturbation, we detected the transition of the PRC from type 1 to type 0 and a possible singular transition point, the property of which agreed quite well with our numerical simulation of the noisy Goodwin model, a simple yet canonical model for the transcription-translation feedback loop of the core clock genes. Furthermore, we estimated the embedding dimension of the limit cycle before and after the perturbation. The trajectory of the limit cycle was embedded in two dimensions but with the perturbation of the state point moved out of the trajectory, the relaxation process was generally embedded in higher dimensions. The average number of embedding dimensions at each dose of FK increased as the FK dose increased but most of the relaxation process was generally embedded within four dimensions. These findings support the existence of a circadian limit cycle oscillator in mammalian cells and suggest that a small number of variables determine the relaxation process after a perturbation."
https://openalex.org/W2738450365,"Background Observational studies have shown a beneficial effect of obesity on bone health; however, most of those studies were not based on bone biopsies. Metabolic syndrome (MetS) could have an effect on bone remodeling. However, there are no data on the effects of MetS in the presence of renal osteodystrophy. Objective The aim of this study was to investigate associations between MetS and renal osteodystrophy using the bone histomorphometric turnover-mineralization-volume (TMV) classification. Design, setting, participants & measurements This observational cross-sectional study included 55 hemodialysis patients (28 women/27 men) who were evaluated for MetS and bone histomorphometry. Biochemical parameters included calcium, phosphorus, alkaline phosphatase, intact parathyroid hormone (iPTH), 25-hydroxyvitamin D, free serum leptin, fibroblast growth factor 23 (FGF23), intact osteocalcin, sclerostin (Scl), glucose, insulin, and thyroid hormones. Robust models of multivariate linear regressions were used for the statistical analyses. Results Females had higher iPTH levels (1,143 vs. 358, p = 0.02). Patients with normal bone volume (BV/TV) had a higher prevalence of MetS (73.6% vs. 41.7%, p = 0.02) and higher serum phosphorus, C-terminal FGF23 and insulin levels. The multivariate regression analysis showed that low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL) was positively correlated with bone formation rate (BFR/BS) and negatively associated with mineralization lag time. Bone volume was negatively associated with age but positively associated with MetS. Body mass index (BMI) was not correlated with any of the bone histomorphometric parameters. Conclusion Our results suggest that MetS is not a risk factor for low bone volume in hemodialysis patients. Furthermore, BMI alone was not related to bone volume in this population."
https://openalex.org/W2735058606,"The North American little black ant, Monomorium sp. AZ-02 (subfamily Myrmicinae), displays a dimorphism that consists of alate (winged) and ergatoid (wingless) queens. Surveys at our field site in southcentral Arizona, USA, demonstrated that only one queen phenotype (alate or ergatoid) occurred in each colony during the season in which reproductive sexuals were produced. A morphometric analysis demonstrated that ergatoid queens retained all specialized anatomical features of alate queens (except for wings), and that they were significantly smaller and had a lower mass than alate queens. Using eight morphological characters, a discriminant analysis correctly categorized all queens (40 of 40) of both phenotypes. A molecular phylogeny using 420 base pairs of the mitochondrial gene cytochrome oxidase I demonstrated that alate and ergatoid queens are two alternative phenotypes within the species; both phenotypes were intermixed on our phylogeny, and both phenotypes often displayed the same haplotype. A survey of the genus Monomorium (358 species) found that wingless queens (ergatoid queens, brachypterous queens) occur in 42 of 137 species (30.6%) in which the queen has been described. These wingless queen species are geographically and taxonomically widespread as they occur on several continents and in eight species groups, suggesting that winglessness probably arose independently on many occasions in the genus."
https://openalex.org/W2735677486,"Retention and recruitment of part time clinical adjunct faculty members in dental education is becoming increasingly difficult as dental schools come to rely on this workforce for their increased involvement in clinical education. Contributing factors include full time faculty shortage, aging workforce, practice and student debt, practice and family commitments, and financial compensation. This study attempts to ascertain barriers to teaching so appropriate strategies can be formulated to address this issue.In the spring of 2016 an email survey was sent to current and former adjunct faculty members to ascertain demographics and retention and recruitment strategies. Descriptive analyses were completed for all variables in the sample.Twenty nine of forty six subjects responded to the survey with a response rate of 63%. Subjects over the age of sixty comprised 55% with only 17% being under the age of forty five. Overall family and practice commitments along with compensation were the primary barriers to teaching part time. For new dentists, student loan debt was the primary barrier to teaching. Travel to teach was also a barrier as 70% of respondents drove 200 miles or less to the dental school.The study demonstrated that the aging part time work force is a great concern and new part time clinical adjunct faculty members must be recruited. Barriers to recruitment and retention of faculty must be considered and addressed to sustain this teaching model."
https://openalex.org/W2738650665,"While the immune system is essential for the maintenance of the homeostasis, health and survival of humans, aberrant immune responses can lead to chronic inflammatory and autoimmune disorders. Pharmacological modulation of drug targets in the immune system to ameliorate disease also carry a risk of immunosuppression that could lead to adverse outcomes. Therefore, it is important to understand the 'immune fingerprint' of novel therapeutics as they relate to current and, clinically used immunological therapies to better understand their potential therapeutic benefit as well as immunosuppressive ability that might lead to adverse events such as infection risks and cancer. Since the mechanistic investigation of pharmacological modulators in a drug discovery setting is largely compound- and mechanism-centric but not comprehensive in terms of immune system impact, we developed a human tissue based functional assay platform to evaluate the impact of pharmacological modulators on a range of innate and adaptive immune functions. Here, we demonstrate that it is possible to generate a qualitative and quantitative immune system impact of pharmacological modulators, which might help better understand and predict the benefit-risk profiles of these compounds in the treatment of immune disorders."
https://openalex.org/W2735700093,"Alendronate, a nitrogen-containing bisphosphonate, is well established as a treatment for osteoporosis through regulation of osteoclast activity. Previously, the pharmacological effects of bisphosphonates on cells outside the bone environment have been considered irrelevant because bisphosphonates target bone. Here we show that administration of alendronate impairs muscle regeneration in mice after bone fracture. A series of injections of alendronate alone or bone fracture alone did not affect muscle regeneration induced by cold injury. In contrast, alendronate treatment plus bone fracture severely impaired the regeneration of muscle that closely contacts the bone fracture site after cold injury. After cold injury, M-cadherin-positive myogenic cells disappeared in the damaged muscle areas of mice receiving the combination of alendronate treatment and bone fracture. The present results suggest that the muscle regeneration capacity is impaired by bone fracture in mice receiving alendronate treatment. The present research on the pharmacological effects of alendronate on muscle regeneration will aid in understanding of the in vivo action of alendronate on skeletal muscles."
