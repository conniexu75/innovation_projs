https://openalex.org/W2912652602,"Vaccine efficacy (VE) estimates are crucial for assessing the suitability of dengue vaccine candidates for public health implementation, but efficacy trials are subject to a known bias to estimate VE toward the null if heterogeneous exposure is not accounted for in the analysis of trial data. In light of many well-characterized sources of heterogeneity in dengue virus (DENV) transmission, our goal was to estimate the potential magnitude of this bias in VE estimates for a hypothetical dengue vaccine. To ensure that we realistically modeled heterogeneous exposure, we simulated city-wide DENV transmission and vaccine trial protocols using an agent-based model calibrated with entomological and epidemiological data from long-term field studies in Iquitos, Peru. By simulating a vaccine with a true VE of 0.8 in 1,000 replicate trials each designed to attain 90% power, we found that conventional methods underestimated VE by as much as 21% due to heterogeneous exposure. Accounting for the number of exposures in the vaccine and placebo arms eliminated this bias completely, and the more realistic option of including a frailty term to model exposure as a random effect reduced this bias partially. We also discovered a distinct bias in VE estimates away from the null due to lower detectability of primary DENV infections among seronegative individuals in the vaccinated group. This difference in detectability resulted from our assumption that primary infections in vaccinees who are seronegative at baseline resemble secondary infections, which experience a shorter window of detectable viremia due to a quicker immune response. This resulted in an artefactual finding that VE estimates for the seronegative group were approximately 1% greater than for the seropositive group. Simulation models of vaccine trials that account for these factors can be used to anticipate the extent of bias in field trials and to aid in their interpretation."
https://openalex.org/W2913436837,"Objective To analyze quality and frequency of OCTA artifacts and to evaluate their impact on the interpretability of OCTA images. Design 75 patients with diabetic retinopathy (DR), retinal artery occlusion (RAO), retinal vein occlusion (RVO), or neovascular age-related macular degeneration (nAMD) and healthy controls were enrolled in this cross-sectional study in the outpatient department of a tertiary eye care center. Methods All participants underwent an OCTA examination (spectral domain OCT Cirrus 5000 equipped with the AngioPlex module). OCTA scans were analyzed independently by two experienced ophthalmologists. Frequency of various artifacts for the entire OCTA scan and for different segmentation layers and the grading of OCTA interpretability were investigated. Results The analysis of 75 eyes of 38 women and 37 men between 24 and 94 years were included. Six eyes had no retinal disease, 19 eyes had nAMD, 16 had DR, 19 eyes had RVO, and 15 eyes showed RAO. A macular edema (ME) was present in 40 of the diseased eyes. Projection artifacts occurred in all eyes in any structure below the superficial retinal vessel layer, segmentation and motion artifacts were found in 55% (41/75) and 49% (37/75) of eyes, respectively. Other artifacts occurred less frequently. Segmentation artifacts were significantly more frequent in diseased than in healthy eyes (p<0.01). Qualitative assessment of OCTA images was graded as excellent in 65% and sufficient in 25% of cases, adding up to 91% images deemed acceptable for examination. Presence of ME was associated with a significantly poorer interpretability (p<0.01). Conclusion and Relevance Various artifacts appear at different frequencies in OCTA images. Nevertheless, a qualitative assessment of the OCTA images is almost always possible. Good knowledge of possible artifacts and critical analysis of the complete OCTA dataset are essential for correct clinical interpretation and determining a precise clinical diagnosis."
https://openalex.org/W2913032218,"Biological aging is associated with progressive damage accumulation, loss of organ reserves, and systemic inflammation ('inflammaging'), which predispose for a wide spectrum of chronic diseases, including several types of cancer. In contrast, aerobic exercise training (AET) reduces inflammation, lowers all-cause mortality, and enhances both health and lifespan. In this study, we examined the benefits of early-onset, lifelong AET on predictors of health, inflammation, and cancer incidence in a naturally aging mouse model (C57BL/J6). Lifelong, voluntary wheel-running (O-AET; 26-month-old) prevented age-related declines in aerobic fitness and motor coordination vs. age-matched, sedentary controls (O-SED). AET also provided partial protection against sarcopenia, dynapenia, testicular atrophy, and overall organ pathology, hence augmenting the ‘physiologic reserve’ of lifelong runners. Systemic inflammation, as evidenced by a chronic elevation in 17 of 18 pro- and anti-inflammatory cytokines and chemokines (P < 0.05 O-SED vs. 2-month-old Y-CON), was potently mitigated by lifelong AET (P < 0.05 O-AET vs. O-SED), including master regulators of the cytokine cascade and cancer progression (IL-1β, TNF-α, and IL-6). In addition, circulating SPARC, previously known to be upregulated in metabolic disease, was elevated in old, sedentary mice, but was normalized to young control levels in lifelong runners. Remarkably, malignant tumours were also completely absent in the O-AET group, whereas they were present in the brain (pituitary), liver, spleen, and intestines of sedentary mice. Collectively, our results indicate that early-onset, lifelong running dampens inflammaging, protects against multiple cancer types, and extends healthspan of naturally-aged mice."
https://openalex.org/W2912759883,"Habitat forming 'ecosystem engineers' such as kelp species create complex habitats that support biodiverse and productive communities. Studies of the resilience and stability of ecosystem engineers have typically focussed on the role of external factors such as disturbance. However, their population dynamics are also likely to be influenced by internal processes, such that the environmental modifications caused by engineer species feedback to affect their own demography (e.g. recruitment, survivorship). In numerous regions globally, kelp forests are declining and experiencing reductions in patch size and kelp density. To explore how resilience and stability of kelp habitats is influenced by this habitat degradation, we created an array of patch reefs of various sizes and supporting adult Ecklonia radiata kelp transplanted at different densities. This enabled testing of how sub-canopy abiotic conditions change with reductions in patch size and adult kelp density, and how this influenced demographic processes of microscopic and macroscopic juvenile kelp. We found that ecosystem engineering by adult E. radiata modified the environment to reduce sub-canopy water flow, sedimentation, and irradiance. However, the capacity of adult kelp canopy to engineer abiotic change was dependent on patch size, and to a lesser extent, kelp density. Reductions in patch size and kelp density also impaired the recruitment, growth and survivorship of microscopic and macroscopic juvenile E. radiata, and even after the provisioning of established juveniles, demographic processes were impaired in the absence of sufficient adult kelp. These results are consistent with the hypothesis that ecosystem engineering by adult E. radiata facilitates development of juvenile conspecifics. Habitat degradation seems to impair the ability of E. radiata to engineer abiotic change, causing breakdown of positive intraspecific feedback and collapse of demographic functions, and overall, leading to reductions in ecosystem stability and resilience well before local extirpation."
https://openalex.org/W2914710934,"Deep subcortical lesions (DSCL) of the brain, are present in ~60% of the ageing population, and are linked to cognitive decline and depression. DSCL are associated with demyelination, blood brain barrier (BBB) dysfunction, and microgliosis. Microglia are the main immune cell of the brain. Under physiological conditions microglia have a ramified morphology, and react to pathology with a change to a more rounded morphology as well as showing protein expression alterations. This study builds on previous characterisations of DSCL and radiologically ‘normal-appearing’ white matter (NAWM) by performing a detailed characterisation of a range of microglial markers in addition to markers of vascular integrity. The Cognitive Function and Ageing Study (CFAS) provided control white matter (WM), NAWM and DSCL human post mortem tissue for immunohistochemistry using microglial markers (Iba-1, CD68 and MHCII), a vascular basement membrane marker (collagen IV) and markers of BBB integrity (fibrinogen and aquaporin 4). The immunoreactive profile of CD68 increased in a stepwise manner from control WM to NAWM to DSCL. This correlated with a shift from small, ramified cells, to larger, more rounded microglia. While there was greater Iba-1 immunoreactivity in NAWM compared to controls, in DSCL, Iba-1 levels were reduced to control levels. A prominent feature of these DSCL was a population of Iba-1-/CD68+ microglia. There were increases in collagen IV, but no change in BBB integrity. Overall the study shows significant differences in the immunoreactive profile of microglial markers. Whether this is a cause or effect of lesion development remains to be elucidated. Identifying microglia subpopulations based on their morphology and molecular markers may ultimately help decipher their function and role in neurodegeneration. Furthermore, this study demonstrates that Iba-1 is not a pan-microglial marker, and that a combination of several microglial markers is required to fully characterise the microglial phenotype."
https://openalex.org/W2913015596,"Familial Alzheimer's disease (FAD)-associated presenilin 1 (PS1) serves as a catalytic subunit of γ-secretase complex, which mediates the proteolytic liberation of β-amyloid (Aβ) from β-amyloid precursor protein (APP). In addition to its proteolytic role, PS1 is involved in non-proteolytic functions such as protein trafficking and ion channel regulation. Furthermore, postmortem AD brains as well as AD patients showed dysregulation of cholesterol metabolism. Since cholesterol has been implicated in regulating Aβ production, we investigated whether the FAD PS1-associated cholesterol elevation could influence APP processing. We found that in CHO cells stably expressing FAD-associated PS1 ΔE9, total cholesterol levels are elevated compared to cells expressing wild-type PS1. We also found that localization of APP in cholesterol-enriched lipid rafts is substantially increased in the mutant cells. Reducing the cholesterol levels by either methyl-β-cyclodextrin or an inhibitor of CYP51, an enzyme mediating the elevated cholesterol in PS1 ΔE9-expressing cells, significantly reduced lipid raft-associated APP. In contrast, exogenous cholesterol increased lipid raft-associated APP. These data suggest that in the FAD PS1 ΔE9 cells, the elevated cellular cholesterol level contributes to the altered APP processing by increasing APP localized in lipid rafts."
https://openalex.org/W2912898652,"The enteric protist Blastocystis is one of the most frequently reported parasites infecting both humans and many other animal hosts worldwide. A remarkable genetic diversity has been observed in the species, with 17 different subtypes (STs) on a molecular phylogeny based on small subunit RNA genes (SSU rDNA). Nonetheless, information regarding its distribution, diversity and zoonotic potential remains still scarce, especially in groups other than primates. In Brazil, only a few surveys limited to human isolates have so far been conducted on Blastocystis STs. The aim of this study is to determine the occurrence of Blastocystis subtypes in non-human vertebrate and invertebrate animal groups in different areas of the state of Rio de Janeiro, Brazil. A total of 334 stool samples were collected from animals representing 28 different genera. Blastocystis cultivated samples were subtyped using nuclear small subunit ribosomal DNA (SSU rDNA) sequencing. Phylogenetic analyses and BLAST searches revealed six subtypes: ST5 (28.8%), ST2 (21.1%), ST1 and ST8 (19.2%), ST3 (7.7%) and ST4 (3.8%). Our findings indicate a considerable overlap between STs in humans and other animals. This highlights the importance of investigating a range of hosts for Blastocystis to understand the eco-epidemiological aspects of the parasite and its host specificity."
https://openalex.org/W2915002507,"Given the inherent characteristics of the Hajj pilgrimage, the event is a risk for tuberculosis (TB) infection. Early diagnosis and appropriate management of TB cases by knowledgeable and skilled healthcare workers (HCWs) are key in improving patients' outcome and preventing transmission during the Hajj mass gathering and globally.We conducted a cross-sectional study to assess knowledge, attitude and practice (KAP) of HCWs deployed during the 2016 Hajj regarding TB and its management using an anonymous self-administered questionnaire.Data was collected from 540 HCWs from 13 hospitals. HCWs originated from 17 countries and included physicians, nurses and other non-administrative HCWs. Nearly half of HCWs declared having experience dealing with TB patients. In general, HCWs had average knowledge (mean knowledge score of 52%), above average attitude (mean attitude score of 73%) and good practice (mean practice score of 85%) regarding TB, based on our scoring system and cut-off points. Knowledge gaps were identified in relation to the definition of MDR-/XDR-TB and LTBI, smear microscopy results, length of standard TB treatment for drug-sensitive TB, 2nd line anti-TB drugs, BCG vaccination, and appropriate PPE to be used with active PTB patients. Poor attitudes were found in relation to willingness to work in TB clinic/ward and to the management and treatment of TB patients. Poor practices were reported for commencing anti-TB treatment on suspected TB cases before laboratory confirmation and not increasing natural ventilation in TB patients' rooms. Age, gender, nationality, occupation, length of work experience and experience dealing with TB patients were associated with knowledge scores. Age and occupation were associated with attitude scores while length of work experience and occupation were associated with practice scores. There was a weak but statistically significant positive correlation between score for knowledge and attitude (rs = 0.11, p = 0.009) and attitude and practice (rs = 0.13, p = 0.002).While the results of the study are encouraging, important knowledge gaps and some poor attitudes and practices regarding TB were identified among HCWs during Hajj. This calls for multifaceted interventions to improve HCWs KAP regarding TB including tailored, periodic TB education and training aimed at boosting knowledge and improving behaviour."
https://openalex.org/W2914290033,"Sustainability standards for seafood mainly address environmental performance criteria and are less concerned with the welfare of fisheries workers who produce the seafood. Yet human rights violations such as slavery and human trafficking are widespread in fisheries around the world, and underscore the need for certification bodies and other seafood supply chain actors to improve social performance, in addition to addressing environmental challenges. Calls for socially responsible seafood have referenced human rights law and policy frameworks to shape the guiding principles of socially responsible seafood and to provide the legal machinery to implement these aspirations, but practical guidance on how to achieve this is lacking. To provide clarity on this challenge, we reviewed the literature concerning human rights in the seafood supply chain, and prepared an analysis of opportunities and challenges to implement socially responsible seafood through relevant human rights, legal and policy instruments. We observe that human rights laws are generally framed in favour of addressing violations of civil and political rights, but there remains considerable scope for applying economic, social and cultural (ESC) rights in this context. Other challenges include weakly defined ESC rights infringements, a lack of straightforward mechanisms to enforce human rights entitlements, and practical difficulties such as resources to support and secure rights. On the positive side, governments can draw on international instruments to inspire national policies and legislation to eliminate illegalities from the seafood supply chain. However, for socially responsible seafood principles to translate into tangible actions, these objectives must be rooted in clear legal obligations and be supported by sufficient national capacity and political will."
https://openalex.org/W2912376985,"Background/Aims Extraintestinal cutaneous manifestations of IBD represent a severe disease complication and an early and accurate treatment might positively influence the disease course. Using the patient collective of the Swiss IBD Cohort Study (SIBDCS), we analysed epidemiological as well as clinical factors being associated with the onset of pyoderma gangrenosum, erythema nodosum and aphthous ulcers in IBD patients. Methods We included 3266 SIBDCs patients, 1840 with Crohn’s disease (CD) and 1426 with ulcerative colitis (UC) or IBD unclassified (IBDU) and analysed the association of cutaneous manifestations with age, age at diagnosis time, type of disease, gender, family history, HLA-allotype, smoking, intestinal disease activity, therapy and other extraintestinal manifestations (EIM). Results 354 CD patients and 136 UC/IBDU patients presented with skin manifestations at any time during their disease course. In both, CD and UC, female gender and younger age at IBD diagnosis were significantly associated with extraintestinal skin manifestations. For CD, we also detected a positive family history as associated factor. As an indicator of more intensive intestinal disease activity, patients with cutaneous manifestations of IBD needed more frequently therapy with antibiotics, steroids, immunomodulators and anti-TNF. Multivariate analysis revealed female gender, younger age at diagnosis and presence of other extraintestinal manifestations as factors being associated with skin EIM in IBD patients and anti-TNF as well as immunomodulatory treatment in CD patients. Conclusion Our results suggest that young females with a positive family history of IBD might be at increased risk for the onset of skin manifestations and require a careful screening for such complications."
https://openalex.org/W2913643708,"Cardiovascular magnetic resonance feature tracking (CMR-FT) is increasingly used for myocardial deformation assessment including ventricular strain, showing prognostic value beyond established risk markers if used in experienced centres. Little is known about the impact of appropriate training on CMR-FT performance. Consequently, this study aimed to evaluate the impact of training on observer variance using different commercially available CMR-FT software.Intra- and inter-observer reproducibility was assessed prior to and after dedicated one-hour observer training. Employed FT software included 3 different commercially available platforms (TomTec, Medis, Circle). Left (LV) and right (RV) ventricular global longitudinal as well as LV circumferential and radial strains (GLS, GCS and GRS) were studied in 12 heart failure patients and 12 healthy volunteers.Training improved intra- and inter-observer reproducibility. GCS and LV GLS showed the highest reproducibility before (ICC >0.86 and >0.81) and after training (ICC >0.91 and >0.92). RV GLS and GRS were more susceptible to tracking inaccuracies and reproducibility was lower. Inter-observer reproducibility was lower than intra-observer reproducibility prior to training with more pronounced improvements after training. Before training, LV strain reproducibility was lower in healthy volunteers as compared to patients with no differences after training. Whilst LV strain reproducibility was sufficient within individual software solutions inter-software comparisons revealed considerable software related variance.Observer experience is an important source of variance in CMR-FT derived strain assessment. Dedicated observer training significantly improves reproducibility with most profound benefits in states of high myocardial contractility and potential to facilitate widespread clinical implementation due to optimized robustness and diagnostic performance."

Here we analyze shared bicycle use from the perspective of the theory of planned behavior, and propose a model to investigate factors influencing shared bicycle usage in China. A total of 211 shared bicycle users selected from 28 provinces throughout China completed a self-reported survey. Structural equation modelling (SEM) was used to delineate the pathway from shared bicycle usage. The SEM model demonstrated that: (1) shared bicycle use intention was significantly associated with four variables, namely travel attitude(β = 0.491, t = 24.569), social norms(β = 0.149, t = 6.771), travel habits(β = 0.146, t = 7.226) and perceived behavioral control (β = 0.190, t = 11.110); (2) shared bicycle use behavior was significantly affected by shared bicycle use intention(β = 0.406, t = 15.936), and also by travel habits(β = 0.320, t = 11.921); (3) shared bicycle use behavior was also affected by demographic variables (gender, age) and situational factors (distance). The conclusions of this study provide useful data for operators of bicycle services and government policy makers."
https://openalex.org/W2907173810,"Stroke survivors frequently experience a range of post-stroke deficits. Specialized stroke rehabilitation improves recovery, especially if it is started early post-stroke. However, resource limitations often preclude early rehabilitation. Mobile technologies may provide a platform for stroke survivors to begin recovery when they might not be able to otherwise. The study objective was to demonstrate the feasibility of RecoverNow, a tablet-based stroke recovery platform aimed at delivering speech and cognitive therapy.We recruited a convenience sample of 30 acute stroke patients to use RecoverNow for up to 3 months. Allied health professionals assigned specific applications based on standard of care assessments. Participants were encouraged to take home the RecoverNow tablets upon discharge from acute care. The study team contacted participants to return for a follow-up interview 3 months after enrollment. The primary outcome of interest was feasibility, defined using 5 facets: recruitment rate, adherence rate, retention rate, the proportion of successful follow-up interventions, and protocol deviations. We tracked barriers to tablet-based care as a secondary outcome.We successfully recruited 30 of 62 eligible patients in 15 weeks (48% recruitment rate). Participants were non-adherent to tablet-based therapy inside and outside of acute care, using RecoverNow for a median of 12 minutes a day. Retention was high with 23 of 30 patients participating in follow-up interviews (77% retention rate) and all but 3 of the 23 interviews (87%) were successfully completed. Only 2 major protocol deviations occurred: one enrollment failure and one therapy protocol violation. Barriers to tablet-based care were frequently encountered by study participants with many expressing the assigned applications were either too easy or too difficult.Acute stroke patients are interested in attempting tablet-based stroke rehabilitation and are easily recruited early post-stroke. However, tablet-based therapy may be challenging due to patient, device and system-related barriers. Reducing the frequency of common barriers will be essential to keeping patients engaged in tablet-based therapy."
https://openalex.org/W2911972669,"The increasing demand for network applications, such as teleconferencing, multimedia messaging and mobile TV, which have diverse requirements, has resulted in the introduction of Long Term Evolution (LTE) by the Third Generation Partnership Project (3GPP). LTE networks implement resource allocation algorithms to distribute radio resource to satisfy the bandwidth and delay requirements of users. However, the scheduling algorithm problem of distributing radio resources to users is not well defined in the LTE standard and thus considerably affects transmission order. Furthermore, the existing radio resource algorithm suffers from performance degradation under prioritised conditions because of the minimum data rate used to determine the transmission order. In this work, a novel downlink resource allocation algorithm that uses quality of service (QoS) requirements and channel conditions to address performance degradation is proposed. The new algorithm is formulated as an optimisation problem where network resources are allocated according to users’ priority, whereas the scheduling algorithm decides on the basis of users’ channel status to satisfy the demands of QoS. Simulation is used to evaluate the performance of the proposed algorithm, and results demonstrate that it performs better than do all other algorithms according to the measured metrics."
https://openalex.org/W2913740601,"At the time of this study, prior to the introduction of biologics in the US, systemic therapies used for the treatment of moderate-to-severe atopic dermatitis included off-label immunosuppressants and corticosteroids. Immunosuppressant therapy is associated with a substantial risk of side-effects, therefore needing clinical monitoring, and is likely to incur a significant healthcare burden for patients and payers. This retrospective cohort study based on claims data measured immunosuppressant use and its associated burden among US adult patients with atopic dermatitis covered under commercial or Medicare Supplemental insurance from January 01, 2010, to September 30, 2015. Overall, based on age, gender, region, and index year, 4201 control patients with atopic dermatitis without immunosuppressant use were matched with 4204 patients treated with immunosuppressants. The majority (68.5%) of patients using immunosuppressants were non-persistent with immunosuppressant treatment during the 12-month follow-up period after a mean (standard deviation) of 88.1 (70.7) days of immunosuppressant use; 72.3% required systemic steroid rescue treatment. Immunosuppressant users had higher incidence of immunosuppressant-related clinical events than controls; in addition, a larger proportion of immunosuppressant users versus controls developed cancer (0.28% vs 0.14%, respectively; P < 0.0001). Healthcare utilization and costs associated with clinical events and monitoring were also higher for immunosuppressant users compared with controls (total costs, $9516 vs $1630, respectively; P < 0.0001; monitoring costs, $363 vs $54, respectively; P < 0.0001). This study revealed that patients treated with systemic immunosuppressants often require systemic steroids or changes to treatment. The increase in immunosuppressant-related clinical events, including the need for increased monitoring with immunosuppressant treatment, compared with controls demonstrates a substantial treatment burden and highlights the unmet need for more effective long-term therapies for atopic dermatitis with improved safety profiles and reduced monitoring requirements."
https://openalex.org/W2914264236,"Geospatial habitat suitability index (HSI) models have emerged as powerful tools that integrate pertinent spatial information to guide habitat restoration efforts, but have rarely accounted for spatial variation in ecosystem service provision. In this study, we utilized satellite-derived chlorophyll a concentrations for Pamlico Sound, North Carolina, USA in conjunction with data on water flow velocities and dissolved oxygen concentrations to identify potential restoration locations that would maximize the oyster reef-associated ecosystem service of water filtration. We integrated these novel factors associated with oyster water filtration ecosystem services within an existing, ‘Metapopulation Persistence’ focused GIS-based, HSI model containing biophysical (e.g., salinity, oyster larval connectivity) and logistical (e.g., distance to nearest restoration material stockpile site) factors to identify suitable locations for oyster restoration that maximize long-term persistence of restored oyster populations and water filtration ecosystem service provision. Furthermore, we compared the ‘Water Filtration’ optimized HSI with the HSI optimized for ‘Metapopulation Persistence,’ as well as a hybrid model that optimized for both water filtration and metapopulation persistence. Optimal restoration locations (i.e., locations corresponding to the top 1% of suitability scores) were identified that were consistent among the three HSI scenarios (i.e., “win-win” locations), as well as optimal locations unique to a given HSI scenario (i.e., “tradeoff” locations). The modeling framework utilized in this study can provide guidance to restoration practitioners to maximize the cost-efficiency and ecosystem services value of habitat restoration efforts. Furthermore, the functional relationships between oyster water filtration and chlorophyll a concentrations, water flow velocities, and dissolved oxygen applied in this study can guide field- and lab-testing of hypotheses related to optimal conditions for oyster reef restoration to maximize water quality enhancement benefits."

Therefore, the purpose of this study was to analyze the ability of different adiposity indices to identify subjects with MetS among people with intermediate cariovascular risk.The cross-sectional study involved 2478 subjects, recruited by the MARK study. Adiposity measures: general adiposity by body mass index (BMI), central adiposity by waist-to-height ratio (WHtR), fat mass percent by the Clínica Universidad de Navarra-body adiposity estimator (CUN-BAE), percentage of body fat and of visceral adipose tissue by body roundness index (BRI) and visceral obesity and general adiposity with body shape index (ABSI). The diagnosis of MetS was made in accordance with the criteria established in the international consensus of the Joint Scientific Statement National Cholesterol Education Program III.The highest correlation coefficients were obtained by the glycemic components (HbA1c and FPG) of the MetS and ranged from 0.155 to 0.320. The exception was ABSI, which showed lower values in the global analysis and in the males. Values of the area under the ROC curve with the adiposity indices ranged from 0.773 with the BMI in males to 0.567 with ABSI in males. In the logistic regression analysis, all adiposity factors, except ABSI, showed similar OR values of MetS after adjusting for possible confounding factors. In the global analysis, the adiposity index that showed a highest OR of MetS was CUN-BAE (OR 5.50; 95% CI 4.27-7.09). In the analysis by gender, the highest ORs were BMI in males (OR 5.98; 95% CI 4.70-7.60) and both WHtR and BRI in females (OR 4.15; 95% CI 3.09-5.58).All adiposity indices, except for ABSI, show an association with MetS and similar ability to detect subjects with MetS among people with intermediate cariovascular risk."
https://openalex.org/W2912720741,"A novel approach for drug design based on the oral carbapenem analog tebipenem pivoxil (TP) has been proposed. The formation of the tebipenem pivoxil-β-cyclodextrin (TP-β-CD) complex resulted in changes concerning physicochemical properties of TP, which is significant for planning the development of an innovative pharmaceutical formulation as well as in the modifications of biological activity profile of the studied delivery system. The inclusion of TP into β-cyclodextrin (β-CD) was confirmed by spectral (infrared and Raman spectroscopies) and thermal method (differential scanning calorimetry). Precise indications of TP domains responsible for interaction with β-CD were possible through a theoretical approach. The most important physicochemical modifications obtained as an effect of TP inclusion were changes in solubility and its rate depending on acceptor fluids, and an increase in chemical stability in the solid state. Biologically essential effects of TP and β-CD interactions were decreased TP permeability through Caco-2 cell monolayers with the use of efflux effect inhibition and increased antibacterial activity. The proposed approach is an opportunity for development of the treatment in resistant bacterial infections, in which along with physicochemical modifications induced by a drug carrier impact, a carrier synergy with a pharmacological potential of an active pharmaceutical substance could be used."

https://openalex.org/W2913837215,"Background Synthetic lethality describes a relationship between two genes where single loss of either gene does not trigger significant impact on cell viability, but simultaneous loss of both gene functions results in lethality. Targeting synthetic lethal interactions with drug combinations promises increased efficacy in tumor therapy. Materials and methods We established a set of synthetic lethal interactions using publicly available data from yeast screens which were mapped to their respective human orthologs using information from orthology databases. This set of experimental synthetic lethal interactions was complemented by a set of predicted synthetic lethal interactions based on a set of protein meta-data like e.g. molecular pathway assignment. Based on the combined set, we evaluated drug combinations used in late stage clinical development (clinical phase III and IV trials) or already in clinical use for ovarian cancer with respect to their effect on synthetic lethal interactions. We furthermore identified a set of drug combinations currently not being tested in late stage ovarian cancer clinical trials that however have impact on synthetic lethal interactions thus being worth of further investigations regarding their therapeutic potential in ovarian cancer. Results Twelve of the tested drug combinations addressed a synthetic lethal interaction with the anti-VEGF inhibitor bevacizumab in combination with paclitaxel being the most studied drug combination addressing the synthetic lethal pair between VEGFA and BCL2. The set of 84 predicted drug combinations for example holds the combination of the PARP inhibitor olaparib and paclitaxel, which showed efficacy in phase II clinical studies.

Glutaredoxin-1 is a small cytosolic thioltransferase that controls a reversible protein thiol modification, S-glutationylation (protein-GSH adducts), thereby regulating redox signaling. In this study, we examined the mechanism of Glrx regulation of endogenous IL-33 induction in macrophages. Glrx knockdown resulted in impaired de-glutathionylation of TRAF6, which is required for TRAF6 activation, and inhibited downstream IKKβ and NF-κB activation. Inhibitors of NF-κB suppressed IL-33 induction and chromatin IP sequencing data analysis confirmed that IL-33 is an NF-κB-responsive gene. Since TRAF6-NF-κB activation is also essential for IL-33 signaling through its receptor, ST2L, we next tested the involvement of Glrx in exogenous IL-33 responses in RAW264.7 cells. Recombinant IL-33 (rIL-33) administration induced IL-33 mRNA expression in RAW264.7 macrophages, and this was inhibited by Glrx knockdown. Interestingly, rIL-33-induced IL-33 protein was identified as the 20 kDa cleaved form whereas LPS-induced IL-33 protein was identified as full-length IL-33, which may be less active than the cleaved form. In a clinically-relevant mouse model of asthma, intra-tracheal cockroach antigen treatment induced Glrx protein in wild type mouse lungs but Glrx induction was attenuated in IL-33 knockout mouse lungs, suggesting that IL-33 may regulate Glrx induction in vivo in response to allergen challenge. In summary, our data reveal a novel mechanism by which Glrx controls both LPS- and IL-33-mediated NF-κB activation leading to IL-33 production, and paracrine IL-33 can induce Glrx to further regulate inflammatory reactions."
https://openalex.org/W2914911754,"Current approaches to quantifying resilience make extensive use of self-reported data. Problematically, this type of scales is plagued by response distortions-both deliberate and unintentional, particularly in occupational populations. The aim of the current study was to develop an objective index of resilience. The study was conducted in 30 young healthy adults. Following completion of the Connor-Davidson Resilience Scale (CD-RISC) and Depression/Anxiety/Stress Scale (DASS), they were subjected to a series of 15 acoustic startle stimuli (95 dB, 50 ms) presented at random intervals, with respiration, skin conductance and ECG recorded. As expected, resilience (CD-RISC) significantly and negatively correlated with all three DASS subscales-Depression (r = -0.66, p<0.0001), Anxiety (r = -0.50, p<0.005) and Stress (r = -0.48, p<0.005). Acoustic stimuli consistently provoked transient skin conductance (SC) responses, with SC slopes indexing response habituation. This slope significantly and positively correlated with DASS-Depression (r = 0.59, p<0.005), DASS-Anxiety (r = 0.35, p<0.05) and DASS-Total (r = 0.50, p<0.005) scores, and negatively with resilience score (r = -0.47; p = 0.006), indicating that high-resilience individuals are characterized by steeper habituation slopes compared to low-resilience individuals. Our key finding of the connection between habituation of the skin conductance responses to repeated acoustic startle stimulus and resilience-related psychometric constructs suggests that response habituation paradigm has the potential to characterize important attributes of cognitive fitness and well-being-such as depression, anxiety and resilience. With steep negative slopes reflecting faster habituation, lower depression/anxiety and higher resilience, and slower or no habituation characterizing less resilient individuals, this protocol may offer a distortion-free method for objective assessment and monitoring of psychological resilience."

Most PCMs are unsuited to make full use of fossil information, which is a drawback, given the inclusion of such data improves, and in some cases even corrects, the proper understanding of trait evolution. Here we present a new computer application, written in R, that allows the simultaneous computation of temporal trends in phenotypic mean and evolutionary rate along a phylogeny, and to contrast such patterns among different clades within the tree. By using simulation experiments, we show the new implementation, names search.trend is as powerful as existing PCM tools in discerning macroevolutionary patterns in phenotypic means and rates, but differently from any other PCM allows comparing individual clades to each other, and provides rich information about trait evolution for all lineages in the tree."
https://openalex.org/W2911525659,"The prolonged use of many currently available drugs results in the severe side effect of the disruption of glucose metabolism leading to type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM. Gut hormone receptors including glucagon receptor (GCGR) and the incretin hormone receptors: glucagon-like peptide 1 receptor (GLP1R) and gastric inhibitory polypeptide receptor (GIPR) are important drug targets for the treatment of T2DM, as they play roles in the regulation of glucose and insulin levels and of food intake. In this study, we hypothesized that we could compensate for the negative influences of specific drugs on glucose metabolism by the positive incretin effect enhanced by the off-target interactions with incretin GPCR receptors. As a test case, we chose to examine beta-blockers because beta-adrenergic receptors and incretin receptors are expressed in a similar location, making off-target interactions possible. The binding affinity of drugs for incretin receptors was approximated by using two docking scoring functions of Autodock VINA (GUT-DOCK) and Glide (Schrodinger) and juxtaposing these values with the medical information on drug-induced T2DM. We observed that beta-blockers with the highest theoretical binding affinities for gut hormone receptors were reported as the least harmful to glucose homeostasis in clinical trials. Notably, a recently discovered beta-blocker compound 15 ([4-((2S)-3-(((S)-3-(3-bromophenyl)-1-(methylamino)-1-oxopropan-2-yl)amino)-2-(2-cyclohexyl-2-phenylacetamido)-3-oxopropyl)benzamide was among the top-scoring drugs, potentially supporting its use in the treatment of hypertension in diabetic patients. Our recently developed web service GUT-DOCK (gut-dock.miningmembrane.com) allows for the execution of similar studies for any drug-like molecule. Specifically, users can compute the binding affinities for various class B GPCRs, gut hormone receptors, VIPR1 and PAC1R."
https://openalex.org/W2912131755,"Integrating seasonal malaria chemoprevention (SMC), recommended by the WHO since 2012 to prevent malaria infection, with nutrition interventions may improve health outcomes and operational efficiencies. This study assessed the effects of co-packaging interventions on distribution coverage, nutrition, and clinical malaria outcomes in northern Nigeria. From August to November 2014, community volunteers delivered sulfadoxine-pyrimethamine and amodiaquine (SP-AQ) door-to-door each month to approximately 7,000 children aged 6-24 months in seven wards of Madobi, Kano State, Nigeria. In three of the wards children additionally received a lipid-based nutrient supplement (LNS-medium quantity), Plumpy Doz. Coverage, adherence, and anthropometric outcomes were assessed through baseline, midline, and endline household surveys. A facility-based case-control study was also conducted to estimate impact on clinical malaria outcomes. Coverage of SP-AQ was similar between arms at 89% (n = 2,409 child-months [88-90%]) in the SP-AQ only arm and 90% (n = 1,947 child-months [88-92%]) in the SP-AQ plus LNS arm (p = 0.52). Coverage of LNS was 83% (n = 2,409 child-months [81-84%]). Whilst there were marked changes in anthropometric status between baseline, midline and endline, these were largely accounted for by socioeconomic status and must be interpreted with care due to possible measurement issues, especially length-based indices. Overall nutritional status of our most robust measure, weight-for-age, does appear to have improved by endline, but was similar in the two study arms, suggesting no additional benefit of the LNS. While the odds of clinical malaria among those who received the intended intervention were lower in each study arm compared to children who did not receive interventions (SP-AQ only OR = 0.23 [0.09-0.6]; SP-AQ plus LNS OR = 0.22 [0.09-0.55]), LNS was not shown to have an additional impact. Coverage of SMC was high regardless of integrating LNS delivery into the SMC campaign. Supplementation with LNS did not appear to impact nutritional outcomes, but appeared to enhance the impact of SP-AQ on clinical odds of malaria. These results indicate that combining nutritional interventions with seasonal malaria chemoprevention in high-risk areas can be done successfully, warranting further exploration with other products or dosing.

https://openalex.org/W2914038221,"Objectives Despite a high vaccine uptake rate of over 80% in South Korea, the disease burden of influenza is still high among the elderly, which may be due to low effectiveness of vaccines. Therefore, the cost-effectiveness of use among the elderly was analyzed in order to compare the current trivalent influenza vaccine (TIV) with a quadrivalent influenza vaccine (QIV) or MF59-adjuvanted trivalent influenza vaccine (ATIV). Methods A static lifetime Markov model was used. It was assumed that the model would be repeated until individuals reached the age of 100. Cost-effectiveness was analyzed across three age groups (65–74 years, 75–84 years, and ≥85 years), and the at-risk group was studied. Results Compared to the TIV, the QIV was expected to reduce the number of influenza infections by 342,873, complications by 17,011, hospitalizations by 8,568, and deaths by 2,031. The QIV was highly cost-effective when compared to the TIV, with a base case incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) estimated at USD 17,699/QALY (1USD = 1,151KRW), and the ICER decreased with age and was USD 3,431/QALY in the group aged 85 and above. Sensitivity analysis revealed that the ICER was sensitive to the QIV price, the proportion of influenza B, and vaccine mismatching. On the other hand, the ATIV was expected to reduce the number of influenza cases and complications by 1,812,395 and 89,747, respectively, annually, yielding cost-saving among all ages. ATIV price and vaccine efficacy were the most influential parameters for the ICER of ATIV. Conclusions The QIV and ATIV strategies were considered more cost-effective in comparison to the TIV for vaccination strategies implemented for the elderly. However, owing to a lack of data on the effectiveness of ATIV among the elderly, a large-scale effectiveness study is required."
https://openalex.org/W2915066788,"Background Visceral adipose tissue (VAT) is a strong predictor of cardiometabolic health, and lifestyle factors may have a positive influence on VAT depot. This study aimed to assess the cross-sectional associations between baseline levels of physical activity (PA), sedentary behaviours (SB) and adherence to the Mediterranean diet (MedDiet) with VAT depot in older individuals with overweight/obesity and metabolic syndrome. Methods Baseline data of the PREDIMED-Plus study including a sample of 1,231 Caucasian men and women aged 55–75 years were used. Levels of leisure-time PA (total, light, and moderate-to-vigorous, in METs·min/day) and SB (total and TV-viewing, in h/day) were evaluated using validated questionnaires. Adherence to the MedDiet was evaluated using a 17-item energy-restricted MedDiet (erMedDiet) screener. The chair-stand test was used to estimate the muscle strength. VAT depot was assessed with DXA-CoreScan. Multivariable adjusted linear regression models were used to evaluate the association between lifestyle factors and VAT. For the statistics we had used multiadjusted linear regression models. Results Total leisure-time PA (100 METs·min/day: β -24.3g, -36.7;-11.9g), moderate-to-vigorous PA (β -27.8g, 95% CI -40.8;-14.8g), chair-stand test (repeat: β -11.5g, 95% CI -20.1;-2.93g) were inversely associated, and total SB (h/day: β 38.2g, 95% CI 14.7;61.7) positively associated with VAT. Light PA, TV-viewing time and adherence to an erMedDiet were not significantly associated with VAT. Conclusions In older adults with overweigh/obesity and metabolic syndrome, greater PA, muscle strength, and lower total SB were associated with less VAT depot. In this study, adherence to an erMedDiet was not associated with lower VAT."
https://openalex.org/W2914273404,"Background and aim Dynamic magnetic resonance imaging with gadolinium-ethoxybenzyl-diethylenetriamine pentaacetic acid (EOB-MRI) can be used not only to detect liver tumors but also to estimate liver function. The aim of this study was to establish a new EOB-MRI-based formula to determine the resection limit in patients undergoing hepatectomy. Methods Twenty-eight patients with a normal liver (NL group) and five with an unresectable cirrhotic liver (UL group) who underwent EOB-MRI were included. Standardized liver function (SLF) was calculated based on the signal intensity (SI), the volume of each subsegment (S1–S8), and body surface area. A formula defining the resection limit was devised based on the difference in the SLF values of patients in the NL and UL groups. The formula was validated in 50 patients who underwent EOB-MRI and hepatectomy. Results The average SLF value in the NL and UL groups was 2038 and 962 FV/m2, respectively. The difference (1076 FV/m2) was consistent with a 70% in resection volume. Thus, the resection limit for hepatectomy was calculated as a proportion of 70%: 70×(SLF−962)/1076 (%). The one patient who underwent hepatectomy over the resection limit died due to liver failure. In other 49 patients, in whom the resection volume was less than the resection limit, procedures were safely performed. Conclusions Our formula for resection limit based on EOB-MRI can improve the safety of hepatectomy."

We investigated associations between CDD and muscle strength in a general Japanese population. We used mid-sagittal-plane MRIs to assess CDD in 344 subjects recruited from participants in our community health-check project, and measured body mass index (BMI), skeletal muscle index (SMI), and muscle strength in the neck, trunk, hands, and legs. CDD was scored based on the prevalence and severity of intravertebral disc degeneration. Spearman correlation coefficients were used to evaluate whether the SMI or muscle-strength values were correlated with the disc degenerative score. Stepwise multiple linear regression analyses were then conducted with the CDD score as the dependent variable, and age, sex, BMI, and muscle strength as independent variables, for each gender. These analyses used the muscle-strength parameters that were found to be correlated with the CDD scores in the single correlation analyses. The CDD scores were similar in men and women. Men had significantly more muscle strength in the neck, trunk, hands, and legs. There was a significant negative corelation between the CDD score and the trunk strength in both sexes, handgrip in men, and leg strength in women in the single-variable correlation analysis. Including age and the limb- or trunk-muscle strength comprehensively, multiple linear regression analyses showed that age was the strongest factor that was independently associated with CDD in both sexes, and that the effects were attenuated by limb and trunk muscle strength."
https://openalex.org/W2912718256,"The small GTPases, Rab5 and Rab7, are key regulators at multiple stages of the endocytic/endolysosomal pathway, including fusion and maturation of endosomes. In yeast, Vps21p (Rab5 homolog) recruits a GEF for Rab7 and activates the downstream Ypt7p (Rab7 homolog) on endosomal membrane. Although the model of this sequential activation from Vps21p to Ypt7p in the endocytic pathway has been established, activation mechanism of Ypt7p in the Vps21p-independent pathway has not been completely clarified. Here we show that Ypt7p is activated and mediates vacuolar fusion in cells lacking all yeast Rab5 genes, VPS21, YPT52, and YPT53. We also demonstrate that deletion of both VPS21 and YPT7 genes cause severe defect in the AP-3 pathway as well as the CPY pathway although the AP-3 pathway is mostly intact in each vps21Δ or ypt7Δ mutant. Interestingly, in vps21Δ ypt7Δ mutant cargos trafficked via the VPS or endocytic pathway accumulate beside nucleus whereas cargo trafficked via the AP-3 pathway disperse in the cytosol. These findings suggest that Ypt7p is activated and plays a Rab5-independent role in the AP-3-mediated pathway."

We assessed immunogenicity and antitumor potential of recombinant MASH2 protein combined with AS15 immunostimulant (recMASH2+AS15) in CB6F1 and Apc+/Min-FCCC mice. CB6F1 mice received 4 injections of recMASH2+AS15 or AS15 alone before challenge with TC1-MASH2 tumor cells (Tumor Challenge). Apc+/Min-FCCC mice received 9 injections of recMASH2+AS15 or vehicle (phosphate buffer saline [PBS] or AS15 alone), before (two independent Prophylactic Studies) or after (Immunotherapy) colon adenomas were detectable by colonoscopy. CB6F1 mice immunized with recMASH2+AS15 had a significantly smaller mean tumor size and improved survival rate compared to controls (104 mm2 vs. 197 mm2 [p = 0.009] and 67% vs. 7% [p = 0.001], respectively). In Prophylactic Study 1, the mean number of colon adenomas was significantly lower in Apc+/Min-FCCC mice receiving recMASH2+AS15 compared to PBS (1.8 [95% confidence interval 1.0-3.3] vs. 5.2 [3.7-7.4], p = 0.003). Fewer microadenomas were observed in recMASH2+AS15 groups compared to PBS in both Prophylactic Studies (Study 1: mean 0.4 [0.2-1.0] vs. 1.5 [0.9-2.4], p = 0.009; Study 2: 0.4 [0.2-0.6] vs. 1.1 [0.8-1.5], p = 0.001). In the Immunotherapy Study, fewer colon adenomas tended to be observed in recMASH2+AS15-treated mice (4.1 [2.9-6.0]) compared to controls (AS15 4.7 [3.3-6.6]; PBS 4.9 [3.5-6.9]; no significant difference). recMASH2+AS15 induced MASH2-specific antibody and CD4+ responses in both mouse models. recMASH2+AS15 partially protected mice against MASH2-expressing tumors and reduced spontaneous colorectal adenomas in Apc+/Min-FCCC mice, indicating that MASH2/HASH2 antigens are targets for colorectal cancer immunotherapy."

Here, we aim to identify tumor-based genomic markers of response to VEGF TT to optimize treatment selection.From an institutional database, primary tumor tissue was obtained from 79 patients with clear cell mRCC, and targeted sequencing was performed. Clinical outcomes were obtained retrospectively. Progression-free survival (PFS) on first-line VEGF TT was correlated to genomic alterations (GAs) using Kaplan-Meier methodology and Cox proportional hazard models. A composite model of significant GAs predicting PFS in the first-line setting was developed.Absence of VHL mutation was associated with inferior PFS on first-line VEGF TT. A trend for inferior PFS was observed with GAs in TP53 and FLT1 C/C variant. A composite model of these 3 GAs was associated with inferior PFS in a dose-dependent manner.In mRCC, a composite model of TP53 mutation, wild type VHL, and FLT1 C/C variant strongly predicted PFS on first-line VEGF TT in a dose-dependent manner.

https://openalex.org/W2914457068,"Perception of inclination in the gravity field and perception of light direction are two important environmental signals implicated in the control of plant shape and habit. However, their quantitative study in light-grown plants remains a challenge. We present a novel method here to determine the sensitivities to gravitropism and phototropism. The method combines: (i) an original experimental device of isotropic light to disentangle gravitropic and phototropic plant responses; and (ii) model-assisted phenotyping using recent models of tropism perception—the AC model for gravitropism alone and the ArC model for gravitropism combined with phototropism. We first assessed the validity of the AC and ArC models on poplar, the classical species model for woody plants. We then tested the method on three woody species contrasted by their habit and tolerance to shade: poplar (Populus tremula*alba), oak (Quercus petraea) and beech (Fagus sylvatica). The method was found to be effective to quantitatively discriminate the tested species by their ratio of tropistic sensitivities. The method thus appears as an interesting tool to quantitatively determine tropistic sensitivities, a prerequisite for assessing the role of tropisms in the control of the variability of the habit and/or tolerance to shade of woody species in the future."
https://openalex.org/W2914903973,"Community kitchens (CKs) have been recommended as public health strategies with social and nutritional health benefits for low-income participants and their families in different settings. The benefit of CKs in improving the food security status of participants in the context of conflict and displacement is less conclusive. This study aimed to qualitatively explore the impact of CKs on the food security status of community kitchen workers (CWs) and Syrian refugee (SR) families in Lebanon. An exploratory qualitative descriptive approach was adopted. Focus group discussions were conducted with 15 CWs and 49 SRs, and transcripts were analyzed thematically. Emerging themes included: motivation to join the CKs (CWs only), perception towards CKs, impact of these CKs, and their sustainability (both groups). Motivating factors for CWs included financial, internal and societal drivers, and the favorable type of work in kitchens. The perception towards CKs was overall positive among CWs and SR beneficiaries. Both groups reported the positive impact of CKs on their food security and financial status, which in turn affected positively their psychological health. At the social level, CWs indicated that the kitchen’s friendly atmosphere increased social cohesion and companionship between Syrians and Lebanese within the kitchen. In addition, CWs reported increased sense of empathy towards SRs benefiting from the CK services. According to study participants, the positive impact of the CKs was almost completely reversed when their operation and services were interrupted for two months. Both CWs and SRs identified facilitators and barriers that can affect the sustainability of the kitchens, including financial and entrepreneurial skills. In conclusion, findings from this study highlight that CKs can be promising programs to improve the food security and livelihoods of participants, while also increasing social cohesion and integration of refugees within host communities in protracted crisis contexts."
https://openalex.org/W2912424012,"Background Human cytomegalovirus (HCMV) can be managed by monitoring HCMV DNA in the blood and giving valganciclovir when viral load exceeds a defined value. We hypothesised that such pre-emptive therapy should occur earlier than the standard 3000 genomes/ml (2520 IU/ml) when a seropositive donor transmitted virus to a seronegative recipient (D+R-) following solid organ transplantation (SOT). Methods Our local protocol was changed so that D+R- SOT patients commenced valganciclovir once the viral load exceeded 200 genomes/ml; 168 IU/ml (new protocol). The decision point remained at 3000 genomes/ml (old protocol) for the other two patient subgroups (D+R+, D-R+). Virological outcomes were assessed three years later, when 74 D+R- patients treated under the old protocol could be compared with 67 treated afterwards. The primary outcomes were changes in peak viral load, duration of viraemia and duration of treatment in the D+R- group. The secondary outcome was the proportion of D+R- patients who developed subsequent viraemia episodes. Findings In the D+R- patients, the median values of peak viral load (30,774 to 11,135 genomes/ml, p<0.0215) were significantly reduced on the new protocol compared to the old, but the duration of viraemia and duration of treatment were not. Early treatment increased subsequent episodes of viraemia from 33/58 (57%) to 36/49 (73%) of patients (p< 0.0743) with a significant increase (p = 0.0072) in those episodes that required treatment (16/58; 27% versus 26/49; 53%). Median peak viral load increased significantly (2,103 to 3,934 genomes/ml, p<0.0249) in the D+R+ but not in the D-R+ patient subgroups. There was no change in duration of viraemia or duration of treatment for any patient subgroup. Interpretation Pre-emptive therapy initiated at the first sign of viraemia post-transplant significantly reduced the peak viral load but increased later episodes of viraemia, consistent with the hypothesis of reduced antigenic stimulation of the immune system."
https://openalex.org/W2913090472,"Assisted migration can aid in the conservation of narrowly endemic species affected by habitat loss, fragmentation and climate change. Here, we employ a multidisciplinary approach by examining the population genetic structure of a threatened, dioecious rainforest tree of the subtropical notophyll vine forests of eastern Australia, Fontainea rostrata, and its potential requirements for population enhancement and translocation to withstand the effects of anthropogenic fragmentation and climate change. We used microsatellite markers to gain an understanding of the way genetic diversity is partitioned within and among the nine extant populations of F. rostrata identified in this study. We combined the results with species distribution modelling to identify populations vulnerable to possible future range shifts based on climate change projections. We found regional differences between the species’ main distribution in the south and a disjunct northern population cluster (FRT = 0.074, FSR = 0.088, FST = 0.155), in mean allelic richness (AR = 2.77 vs 2.33, p < 0.05), expected heterozygosity (HE = 0.376 vs 0.328), and inbreeding (F = 0.116 vs 0.219). Species distribution models predicted that while southern populations of F. rostrata are likely to persist for the next 50 years under the RCP6.0 climate change scenario, with potential for a small-scale expansion to the south-east, the more highly inbred and less genetically diverse northern populations will come under increasing pressure to expand southwards as habitat suitability declines. Given the species’ genetic structure and with the aim to enhance genetic diversity and maximise the likelihood of reproductive success, we recommend that plant reintroductions to supplement existing populations should be prioritised over translocation of the species to new sites. However, future conservation efforts should be directed at translocation to establish new sites to increase population connectivity, focussing particularly on habitat areas identified as persisting under conditions of climate change."
https://openalex.org/W2911333380,"To clarify the possible mechanism causing binaural diplacusis with low-tone hearing loss, two psychoacoustic experiments were performed with 20 healthy subjects, using harmonic complex tones. In the first experiment, two tones were presented unilaterally, either from the right or left side. One of the tones presented was higher in frequency in terms of the fundamental component, but lower or equal in frequency in terms of the highest component, than the other tone. The subjects were asked which tone was higher in pitch after listening to both tones. They were also asked to compare tones in which low-tone components were eliminated. In the second experiment, the subjects heard these complex tones binaurally, with low-tone components eliminated in one ear. In the first experiment, most subjects perceived pitch direction, that is, higher or lower, in a reverse way when low-tone components were eliminated from the complex tones. In the second experiment, approximately half of all subjects heard the tones at different pitches in both ears. Under certain conditions, complex tone stimulation may induce binaural diplacusis when low-tone hearing is lost in one ear."

We explored the attitude and willingness of women to start conversations on VMMC with their sexual partners in a South African peri-urban setting to increase VMMC uptake.Thirty women with median age of 30 years (inter-quartile range 26-33 years) were interviewed in a language of their choice. Key questions included: types of approach to use, gender roles, benefits and barriers to introducing the topic of VMMC, and perceptions of VMMC. Interviews were digitally-recorded, transcribed, and translated. Through a standard iterative process, a codebook was developed (QSR NVIVO 10 software) and inductive thematic analysis applied.Most women were willing talk to their sexual partners about circumcision, but indicated that the decision to circumcise remained that of their sexual partner. Women felt that they should encourage their partners, show more interest in circumcision, be patient, speak in a caring and respectful tone, choose a correct time when their partner was relaxed and talk in a private space about VMMC. Using magazine/newspaper articles, pamphlets or advertisements were identified as tools that could aid their discussion. Substantial barriers to initiating conversations on VMMC included accusations by partner on infidelity, fear of gender-based violence, cultural restrictions and hesitation to speak to a mature partner about circumcision.Women need to ensure that before talking to their partner about circumcision, the environment and approach that they use are conducive. Female social network forums could be used to educate women on conversation techniques, skills to use when talking to their partners and how to address communication challenges about circumcision. Involvement of women in VMMC awareness campaigns could encourage circumcision uptake among men."
https://openalex.org/W2913785273,"Vision begins with the encoding of contrast at specific orientations. Several works showed that humans identify their conspecifics best based on the horizontally-oriented information contained in the face image; this range conveys the main morphological features of the face. In contrast, the vertical structure of the eye region seems to deliver optimal cues to gaze direction. The present work investigates whether the human face processing system flexibly tunes to vertical information contained in the eye region when processing gaze direction. Alternatively, face processing may invariantly rely on the horizontal range, supporting the domain specificity of orientation tuning for faces and the gateway role of horizontal content to access any type of facial information. Participants judged the gaze direction of faces staring at a range of lateral positions. They additionally performed an identification task with upright and inverted face stimuli. Across tasks, stimuli were filtered to selectively reveal horizontal (H), vertical (V), or combined (HV) information. Most participants identified faces better based on horizontal than vertical information confirming the horizontal tuning of face identification. In contrast, they showed a vertically-tuned sensitivity to gaze direction. The logistic functions fitting the “left” and “right” response proportion as a function of gaze direction were indeed steeper when based on vertical than on horizontal information. The finding of a vertically-tuned processing of gaze direction favours the hypothesis that visual encoding of face information flexibly switches to the orientation channel carrying the cues most relevant to the task at hand. It suggests that horizontal structure, though predominant in the face stimulus, is not a mandatory gateway for efficient face processing. The present evidence may help better understand how visual signals travel the visual system to enable rich and complex representations of naturalistic stimuli such as faces."

Methods The Spanish National Institute of Statistics supplied data on PC mortality, hospital admission, and population data. We estimated the expected town-specific number of deaths and calculated the standardized mortality ratios. Spatial autoregressive models of Besag-York-Mollié provided smoother municipal estimators of PC mortality risk (all ages; <65 years). We computed the provincial age-standardized rate ratios of PC hospital admissions (all men; <60 years) using Spanish rates as the reference. Results A total of 29,566 PC deaths (6% among those <65 years) were registered between 2010–2014, with three high-mortality risk zones: Northwest Spain; Southwest Andalusia & Granada; and a broad band extending from the Pyrenees Mountains to the north of Valencia. In younger men, the spatial patterns shared the high risk of mortality in the Northwest but not the central band. The PC hospital discharge rates confirmed a North-South gradient but also low mortality/high admission rates in Madrid and Barcelona and the opposite in Southwest Andalusia. Conclusion The consistent high PC mortality/morbidity risk in the Northwest of Spain indicates an area with a real excess of risk. The different spatial pattern in younger men suggests that some factors associated with geographical risk might have differential effects by age. Finally, the regional divergences in mortality and morbidity hint at clinical variability as a source of inequity within Spain."
https://openalex.org/W2914528977,"A simple method to estimate the size of the vaccine bank needed to control an epidemic of an exotic infectious disease in case of introduction into a country is presented. The method was applied to the case of a Lumpy Skin disease (LSD) epidemic in France. The size of the stock of vaccines needed was calculated based on a series of simple equations that use some trigonometric functions and take into account the spread of the disease, the time required to obtain good vaccination coverage and the cattle density in the affected region. Assuming a 7-weeks period to vaccinate all the animals and a spread of the disease of 7.3 km/week, the vaccination of 740 716 cattle would be enough to control an epidemic of LSD in France in 90% of the simulations (608 196 cattle would cover 75% of the simulations). The results of this simple method were then validated using a dynamic simulation model, which served as reference for the calculation of the vaccine stock required. The differences between both models in different scenarios, related with the time needed to vaccinate the animals, ranged from 7% to 10.5% more vaccines using the simple method to cover 90% of the simulations, and from 9.0% to 13.8% for 75% of the simulations. The model is easy to use and may be adapted for the control of different diseases in different countries, just by using some simple formulas and few input data."
https://openalex.org/W2913304617,"This study was inspired by the need to estimate pointwise confidence intervals (CIs) for a nonlinear dose-response model from a dose-finding clinical trial. Profile likelihood based CI for a nonlinear dose response model is often recommended. However, it is still not commonly used in dose-finding studies because it cannot generally be calculated explicitly. Most previous research has mainly focused on the performance of the profile likelihood based CI method compared with other common approaches. However, there are still no reports on computing profile likelihood based pointwise CIs for an entire dose-response curve. Based on a previous dose-finding trial with binary-response data, this present study proposed to calculate profile likelihood based pointwise CIs by using the bisection method with proper calculation order for doses in the curve plus crude search when the expected response is close to a boundary. The convergence could be improved by applying appropriate starting values for the optimization procedure with straightforward programming techniques. The algorithm worked well in most cases based on the simulation study and it can be applied more generally to other dose-response models, and other type of data like normally distributed response. It would indeed be great to be able to use profile likelihood approaches more routinely when constructing pointwise CIs for nonlinear dose-response models."
https://openalex.org/W2913584676,"We explored the hypothesis that high β-diversity of terrestrial vertebrates of Mexico is associated with a high environmental heterogeneity (HEH) and identify the drivers of β-diversity at different spatial scales. We used distribution range maps of 2,513 species of amphibians, reptiles, mammals, and birds occurring in Mexico. We estimated β-diversity for each taxon at four spatial scales (grid cells of 2°, 1°, 0.5° and 0.25°) using the multiplicative formula of Whittaker βw. For each spatial scale, we derived 10 variables of environmental heterogeneity among cells based on raw data of temperature, precipitation, elevation, vegetation and soil. We applied conditional autoregressive models (CAR) to identify the drivers of β-diversity for each taxon at each spatial scale. CARs increased in explanatory power from fine-to-coarse spatial scales in amphibians, reptiles and mammals. The heterogeneity in precipitation including both, coefficient of variation (CV) and range of values (ROV), resulted in the most important drivers of β-diversity of amphibians; the heterogeneity in temperature (CV) and elevation (ROV) were the most important drivers of β-diversity for reptiles; the heterogeneity in temperature (ROV) resulted in the most important driver in β-diversity for mammals. For birds, CARs resulted significant at fine scales (grid cells of 0.5° and 0.25°), and the precipitation (ROV and CV), temperature (ROV), and vegetation (H) and soil (H) were heterogeneity variables retained in the model. We found support for the hypothesis of environmental heterogeneity (HEH) for terrestrial vertebrates at coarse scales (grid cell of 2°). Different variables of heterogeneity, mainly abiotic, were significant for each taxon, reflecting physiological differences among terrestrial vertebrate groups. Our study revealed the importance of mountain areas in the geographic patterns of β-diversity of terrestrial vertebrates in Mexico. At a coarse scale, specific variables of heterogeneity can be used as a proxy of β-diversity for amphibians and reptiles."
https://openalex.org/W2913621805,"As a visual art form, Chinese calligraphic handwriting (CCH) has been found to correlate with certain brain activity and to induce functional connectivity reorganization of the brain. This study investigated the effect of long-term CCH training on brain functional plasticity as assessed with network measures. With the resting-state fMRI data from 31 participants with at least five years of CCH training and 40 controls, we constructed brain functional networks, examined group differences at both the whole brain and modular levels, and correlated the topological characteristics with calligraphy skills. We found that, compared to the control group, the CCH group showed shorter characteristic path lengths and higher local efficiency in certain brain areas in the frontal and parietal cortices, limbic system, basal ganglia, and thalamus. Moreover, these network measures in the cingulate cortex, caudate nucleus, and thalamus were associated with CCH performance (i.e., copying and creating skills). These results suggest that long-term CCH training has a positive effect on the topological characteristics of brain networks."
https://openalex.org/W2769306227,"In research into higher education, the evaluation of completion and dropout rates has generated a steady stream of interest for decades. While most studies only calculate quotes using student and graduate numbers for both phenomena, we propose to additionally consider the budget available to universities. We transfer the idea of the excellence shift indicator [1] from the research to the teaching area, in particular to the completion rate of educational entities. The graduation shift shows the institutions' ability to produce graduates as measured against their basic academic teaching efficiency. It is an important advantage of the graduation shift that it avoids the well-known heterogeneity problem in efficiency measurements. Our study is based on German universities of applied science. Given their politically determined focus on education, this dataset is well-suited for introducing and evaluating the graduation shift. Using a comprehensive dataset covering the years 2008 to 2013, we show that the graduation shift produces results, which correlate closely with the results of the well-known graduation rate and standard Data Envelopment Analysis (DEA). Compared to the graduation rate, the graduation shift is preferable because it allows to take the budget of institutions into account. Compared to the DEA, the computation of the graduation shift is easy, the results are robust, and non-economists can understand them results. Thus, we recommend the graduation shift as an alternative method of efficiency measurement in the teaching area."
https://openalex.org/W2913458432,"We propose a set of family-based burden and kernel tests for censored traits (FamBAC and FamKAC). Here, censored traits refer to time-to-event outcomes, for instance, age-at-onset of a disease. To model censored traits in family-based designs, we used the frailty model, which incorporated not only fixed genetic effects of rare variants in a region of interest but also random polygenic effects shared within families. We first partitioned genotype scores of rare variants into orthogonal between- and within-family components, and then derived their corresponding efficient score statistics from the frailty model. Finally, FamBAC and FamKAC were constructed by aggregating the weighted efficient scores of the within-family components across rare variants and subjects. FamBAC collapsed rare variants within subject first to form a burden test that followed a chi-squared distribution; whereas FamKAC was a variant component test following a mixture of chi-squared distributions. For FamKAC, p-values can be computed by permutation tests or for computational efficiency by approximation methods. Through simulation studies, we showed that type I error was correctly controlled by FamBAC for various variant weighting schemes (0.0371 to 0.0527). However, FamKAC type I error rates based on approximation methods were deflated (max 0.0376) but improved by permutation tests. Our simulations also demonstrated that burden test FamBAC had higher power than kernel test FamKAC when high proportion (e.g. ≥ 80%) of causal variants had effects in the same direction. In contrast, when the effects of causal variants on the censored trait were in mixed directions, FamKAC outperformed FamBAC and had comparable or higher power than an existing method, RVFam. Our proposed framework has the flexibility to accommodate general nuclear families, and can be used to analyze sequence data for censored traits such as age-at-onset of a complex disease of interest."
https://openalex.org/W2913849311,"Plant leaves occur in diverse shapes. Divarication patterns that develop during early growths are one of key factors that determine leaf shapes. We utilized leaves of Microsorum pteropus, a semi-aquatic fern, and closely related varieties to analyze a variation in the divarication patterns. The leaves exhibited three major types of divarication: no lobes, bifurcation, and trifurcation (i.e., monopodial branching). Our investigation of their developmental processes, using time-lapse imaging, revealed localized growths and dissections of blades near each leaf apex. Restricted cell divisions responsible for the apical growths were confirmed using a pulse-chase strategy for EdU labeling assays."
https://openalex.org/W2912443067,"Four methods, including hot acid treatment, hot alkali treatment, calcination treatment and sulfhydrylation treatment, were applied to activate alum plasma in order to obtain new Pb2+ adsorbents. The corresponding adsorption isotherm satisfies the Langmuir equation, and the maximum adsorption of the alum plasma after hot acid treatment, hot alkali treatment and high-temperature calcination were 18.9, 57.3 and 10.9 mg·g-1, respectively, and in the range of 1.23-6.57 times greater than the adsorption capacity of the original alum plasma. The soil culture experiments indicated that the effective Pb content in the soils treated with hot alkali ameliorated alum plasma was significantly lower (p < 0.05) than those treated with the other three types of alum plasma. For example, if the additive content is 5.0%, after a storage period of 16 weeks, the effective Pb content becomes 19.87 mg·kg-1, which corresponds to a reduction of 60.9% in comparison with the control sample. In addition, Specific surface area (BET), Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FIR) were used to characterize the microstructure of alum plasma before and after amelioration. It was evident that hot alkali treatment of alum plasma resulted in smaller particles, a significantly higher specific area and lower mineral crystallinity, which improved the adsorption performance of Pb2+. In conclusion, hot alkali treatment of alum plasma indicates relatively good Pb2+ adsorption ability, and is a promising novel adsorbents that could ameliorate soils that have been polluted by heavy metal Pb."
https://openalex.org/W2914867944,"Analysis of single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-Seq) data often involves filtering out uninteresting or poorly measured genes and dimensionality reduction to reduce noise and simplify data visualization. However, techniques such as principal components analysis (PCA) fail to preserve non-negativity and sparsity structures present in the original matrices, and the coordinates of projected cells are not easily interpretable. Commonly used thresholding methods to filter genes avoid those pitfalls, but ignore collinearity and covariance in the original matrix. We show that a deterministic column subset selection (DCSS) method possesses many of the favorable properties of common thresholding methods and PCA, while avoiding pitfalls from both. We derive new spectral bounds for DCSS. We apply DCSS to two measures of gene expression from two scRNA-Seq experiments with different clustering workflows, and compare to three thresholding methods. In each case study, the clusters based on the small subset of the complete gene expression profile selected by DCSS are similar to clusters produced from the full set. The resulting clusters are informative for cell type."
