Here we describe a mouse model of an anxiety/depressive-like state induced by chronic corticosterone treatment. Furthermore, chronic antidepressant treatment reversed the behavioral dysfunctions and the inhibition of hippocampal neurogenesis induced by corticosterone treatment. In corticosterone-treated mice where hippocampal neurogenesis is abolished by X-irradiation, the efficacy of fluoxetine is blocked in some, but not all, behavioral paradigms, suggesting both neurogenesis-dependent and -independent mechanisms of antidepressant action. Finally, we identified a number of candidate genes, the expression of which is decreased by chronic corticosterone and normalized by chronic fluoxetine treatment selectively in the hypothalamus. Importantly, mice deficient in one of these genes, β-arrestin 2, displayed a reduced response to fluoxetine in multiple tasks, suggesting that β-arrestin signaling is necessary for the antidepressant effects of fluoxetine.

Depression and anxiety are distinct psychiatric disorders with a high comorbidity. Selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) are the most commonly prescribed drugs for the treatment of depression and several anxiety disorders. However, the actions of SSRIs at the molecular and cellular level still remain poorly understood. Furthermore, successful development of animal models displaying features of depression/anxiety disorders that are responsive to treatment remains in its infancy. Recently, compelling work has suggested that SSRIs exert their behavioral activity in rodents through cellular and molecular changes in the hippocampus as well as other brain structures (Santarelli et al., 2003Santarelli L.

The hypothalamo-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis, a crossroad between central and peripheral pathways, is also known to play a key role in the pathogenesis of mood disorders (de Kloet et al., 2005de Kloet E.R.

Based on these findings, long-term exposure to exogenous corticosterone (4-pregnen-11b-DIOL-3 20-DIONE 21-hemisuccinate) in rodents has been used to induce anxiety/depression-like changes in behavior, neurochemistry, and brain morphology (Ardayfio and Kim, 2006Ardayfio P.

Recent results demonstrated that behavioral deficits and decreased cell proliferation in the dentate gyrus of adult mice induced by elevation of glucocorticoid levels are reversed by chronic monoaminergic antidepressant treatment (Murray et al., 2008Murray F. Smith D.W. Hutson P.H. Chronic low dose corticosterone exposure decreased hippocampal cell proliferation, volume and induced anxiety and depression like behaviours in mice.Eur. J. Pharmacol. 2008; 583: 115-127Crossref PubMed Scopus (243) Google Scholar). In addition, in a chronic stress paradigm, the behavioral effects of some, but not all, antidepressants are blocked by the ablation of hippocampal neurogenesis (Surget et al., 2008Surget A. Saxe M. Leman S. Ibarguen-Vargas Y. Chalon S. Griebel G. Hen R. Belzung C. Drug-Dependent Requirement of Hippocampal Neurogenesis in a Model of Depression and of Antidepressant Reversal.Biol. Psychiatry. 2008; 64: 293-301Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (392) Google Scholar). In this study we model an anxiety/depressive-like state in mice by studying the consequences of excess glucocorticoids in an attempt to investigate both neurogenesis-dependent and -independent mechanisms required for the functions of monoaminergic antidepressants. To this end, we show that chronic treatment with fluoxetine and imipramine in mice reverses the behavioral dysfunction induced by long-term exposure to corticosterone in the Open Field (OF) paradigm, Novelty Suppressed Feeding (NSF) test, Forced Swim test (FST), and splash test of grooming behavior. Chronic antidepressant treatment also stimulates the proliferation, differentiation, and survival of neural progenitors in the dentate gyrus. Focal X-irradiation that ablates neurogenesis in the hippocampus while leaving other brain areas intact (Santarelli et al., 2003Santarelli L. Saxe M. Gross C. Surget A. Battaglia F. Dulawa S. Weisstaub N. Lee J. Duman R. Arancio O. et al.Requirement of hippocampal neurogenesis for the behavioral effects of antidepressants.Science. 2003; 301: 805-809Crossref PubMed Scopus (3384) Google Scholar, David et al., 2007David D.J.

Pharmacol. Exp. Ther. 2007; 321: 237-248Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar), coupled with behavioral tests, indicates that there are neurogenesis-dependent and -independent mechanisms mediated by chronic fluoxetine in our model of an anxiety/depression-like state. The neurogenesis-independent mechanisms underlying antidepressant efficacy may be linked to changes in signaling in brain areas other than the hippocampus, as we show that three genes related to G protein receptor coupling, β-arrestin 1, β-arrestin 2, and Giα2 proteins, have decreased expression in the hypothalamus that is reversed by fluoxetine. Genetic ablation of β-arrestin 2 blocked several effects of fluoxetine on behavior, suggesting that β-arrestins are necessary for the anxiolytic/antidepressant activity of this drug. A complete statistical summary is included in Tables S2–S4, available online. Recently, multiple studies have confirmed that long-term exposure to glucocorticoids induces anxiety and depressive-like states in rodents (Stone and Lin, 2008Stone E.A. Lin Y. An anti-immobility effect of exogenous corticosterone in mice.Eur. J. Pharmacol. 2008; 580: 135-142Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar, Gourley et al., 2008Gourley S.L. Wu F.J. Kiraly D.D.

Chronic low dose corticosterone exposure decreased hippocampal cell proliferation, volume and induced anxiety and depression like behaviours in mice.Eur. J. Pharmacol. 2008; 583: 115-127Crossref PubMed Scopus (243) Google Scholar). Using a low dose of corticosterone (35 ug/ml/day or 5 mg/kg/day), we found that C57BL/6Ntac and CD1 mice treated for 4 weeks developed an anxiety-like phenotype in both the OF and NSF test (Figure 1 and Figures S2 and S5, available online). We first tested the effects of 3 week treatment with two distinct antidepressants, a tricyclic (imipramine 40 mg/kg/day) and an SSRI (fluoxetine 18 mg/kg/day), in our model of corticosterone-induced anxiety/depression-like behavior in C57BL/6Ntac mice (see experimental design, Figure S1). In the OF, chronic exogenous corticosterone had a marked effect on all anxiety parameters, resulting in decreased time spent in the center (Figure 1A) and decreased number of entries to the center (data not shown). Interestingly, this anxiety phenotype was reversed by chronic antidepressant treatment (two-way ANOVA, ∗∗p < 0.01, Figures 1A and S7, significant effects of pretreatment, treatment factors, and sampling pretreatment x treatment interactions during the OF sessions [∗∗p < 0.01]). Regarding the total ambulatory distance, chronic corticosterone treatment showed a nonsignificant trend that was abolished by chronic fluoxetine treatment (Figure 1B). Since this trend may affect interpretation of results, we also checked the ratio of total distance in center divided by total distance (or percent path in the center). We found that corticosterone still induced an anxiety-like phenotype as it decreased this measure (Figure S7B). Both fluoxetine and imipramine significantly reversed this phenotype. These data suggest that chronic corticosterone treatment can model an anxious-like state that is responsive to treatment with distinct classes of antidepressants. In the NSF test, we found that chronic corticosterone treatment led to a significant increase in latency to feed (Figure 1C). We then explored whether antidepressants were able to reverse this anxiety/depressive-like state observed in the NSF. Similar to the OF, the change (+36%) in latency to feed induced by chronic corticosterone was reversed by chronic fluoxetine (18 mg/kg/day) and imipramine (40 mg/kg/day) (Figure 1C, Kaplan-Meier survival analysis, Mantel-Cox log-rank test, ∗∗p < 0.01, Figure S7C), without affecting the home food consumption (Figure S7). These data further suggest that chronic corticosterone models a state of anxiety/depression that is responsive to antidepressant treatment. In the mouse FST, two-way ANOVA revealed that chronic corticosterone had no effect, while both fluoxetine and imipramine treatment decreased the duration of mobility during the last four minutes of the test (Figure 1D; significant treatment factor effect [∗∗p < 0.01]). The increase in mobility duration with both antidepressants was observed in corticosterone-treated (from 12.2 ± 2.3 s in corticosterone group to 31.7 ± 5.1 s and 20.3 ± 3.3 s in corticosterone/fluoxetine and corticosterone/imipramine group, respectively) and non-corticosterone-treated animals (from 12.2 ± 2.4 s in vehicle [hydroxypropyl-β-cyclodextrin, or β-CD] to 30.3 ± 5.3 s and 20.7 ± 3.6 s in fluoxetine and imipramine group, respectively). We next assessed the coat state of the animals. This measure has been described as a reliable and well-validated index of a depressed-like state (Griebel et al., 2002Griebel G. Simiand J. Serradeil-Le Gal C. Wagnon J. Pascal M. Scatton B. Maffrand J.P. Soubrie P. Anxiolytic- and antidepressant-like effects of the non-peptide vasopressin V1b receptor antagonist, SSR149415, suggest an innovative approach for the treatment of stress-related disorders.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2002; 99: 6370-6375Crossref PubMed Scopus (409) Google Scholar, Santarelli et al., 2003Santarelli L. Saxe M. Gross C. Surget A. Battaglia F. Dulawa S. Weisstaub N. Lee J. Duman R. Arancio O. et al.Requirement of hippocampal neurogenesis for the behavioral effects of antidepressants.Science. 2003; 301: 805-809Crossref PubMed Scopus (3384) Google Scholar). Long-term glucocorticoid exposure, similar to chronic stress (Surget et al., 2008Surget A. Saxe M. Leman S. Ibarguen-Vargas Y. Chalon S. Griebel G. Hen R. Belzung C. Drug-Dependent Requirement of Hippocampal Neurogenesis in a Model of Depression and of Antidepressant Reversal.Biol. Psychiatry. 2008; 64: 293-301Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (392) Google Scholar), induced physical changes including deterioration of coat state (Figures 1E and S3A) and altered body weight (Figure S3B). Importantly, a 3 week fluoxetine regimen significantly reversed the deterioration of the coat state (Figure 1E) induced by chronic corticosterone (from 2.23 ± 0.09 to 1.80 ± 0.08) (two-way ANOVA with significant effect of pretreatment, treatment factors, and sampling pretreatment x treatment interactions [∗∗p < 0.01]). We then investigated whether the deterioration of the coat state was linked to changes in grooming behavior (Figure 1F). We observed that after squirting a 10% sucrose solution on the mouse's snout, the decreased grooming frequency (−55%, Figure 1F) induced by corticosterone treatment was reversed with 3 weeks of fluoxetine treatment (18 mg/kg/day) (from 3.3 ± 0.5 to 9 ± 1) [two-way ANOVA with significant treatment and pretreatment factors [∗p < 0.05 and ∗∗p < 0.01]). Taken together, these results suggest through multiple behavioral readouts that chronic antidepressant treatment is effective in reversing an anxiety/depression-like phenotype induced by excess glucocorticoids. To further validate our model, we next tested the effects of fluoxetine and a norepinephrine reuptake inhibitor (NRI) (reboxetine 20 mg/kg/day) in chronic corticosterone-treated animals using two additional behavioral measures. In the elevated plus maze, a test associated with anxiety, we found that chronic fluoxetine increased entries into the open arms, while mice treated with reboxetine displayed a strong trend in this measure (Figure 1G; one-way ANOVA, significant effect of treatment [∗∗p < 0.01]). Furthermore, in the Tail Suspension Test (TST), a test of response to antidepressants, both chronic fluoxetine and reboxetine significantly increased mobility (Figure 1H; one-way ANOVA, significant effect of treatment [∗∗p < 0.01, ∗p < 0.05]). We also looked at the effects of chronic corticosterone treatment on the response of the HPA axis to an acute stress. The increase of corticosterone elicited by stress in the control mice was markedly attenuated in corticosterone-treated animals (Figure S3E) (two-way ANOVA with significant effect of pretreatment, treatment factor, and pretreatment x treatment interaction for corticosterone levels [∗∗p < 0.01]). Fluoxetine and imipramine had no effect on stress-induced corticosterone levels, both in baseline conditions and after chronic corticosterone treatment. To investigate the potential cellular mechanisms underlying the behavioral effects of fluoxetine, we next evaluated changes in adult hippocampal neurogenesis hypothesized to be relevant for antidepressant action (Santarelli et al., 2003Santarelli L. Saxe M. Gross C. Surget A. Battaglia F. Dulawa S. Weisstaub N. Lee J. Duman R. Arancio O. et al.Requirement of hippocampal neurogenesis for the behavioral effects of antidepressants.Science. 2003; 301: 805-809Crossref PubMed Scopus (3384) Google Scholar, Airan et al., 2007Airan R.D.

High-speed imaging reveals neurophysiological links to behavior in an animal model of depression.Science. 2007; 317: 819-823Crossref PubMed Scopus (313) Google Scholar). In agreement with previous observations (Murray et al., 2008Murray F. Smith D.W. Hutson P.H. Chronic low dose corticosterone exposure decreased hippocampal cell proliferation, volume and induced anxiety and depression like behaviours in mice.Eur. J. Pharmacol. 2008; 583: 115-127Crossref PubMed Scopus (243) Google Scholar, Qiu et al., 2007Qiu G. Helmeste D.M. Samaranayake A.N. Lau W.M. Lee T.M. Tang S.W. So K.F. Modulation of the suppressive effect of corticosterone on adult rat hippocampal cell proliferation by paroxetine.Neurosci. Bull. 2007; 23: 131-136Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar), chronic corticosterone exposure mimicked the effect of chronic stress on cell proliferation (Surget et al., 2008Surget A. Saxe M. Leman S. Ibarguen-Vargas Y. Chalon S. Griebel G. Hen R. Belzung C. Drug-Dependent Requirement of Hippocampal Neurogenesis in a Model of Depression and of Antidepressant Reversal.Biol. Psychiatry. 2008; 64: 293-301Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (392) Google Scholar), decreasing the number of BrdU-positive cells in the dentate gyrus of the adult mouse hippocampus (−25%) (Figure 2A) (two-way ANOVA with significant effect of treatment factor and sampling pretreatment x treatment interactions [∗∗p < 0.01]). This change in cell proliferation induced by corticosterone was completely reversed by 3 weeks of fluoxetine treatment (18 mg/kg/day). Interestingly, fluoxetine induced a very large and significant effect on proliferation in corticosterone-treated mice, but not in non-corticosterone-treated animals (BrdU-positive cells: from 1335 ± 98.3 in corticosterone-treated animals to 3570 ± 733.1 in corticosterone/fluoxetine group). Although chronic corticosterone treatment alone altered cell proliferation, it did not affect the survival of newborn neurons (Figure 2B) or the number of dendrites and dendritic morphology in doublecortin-positive cells (Figures 2C–2F, 2H, and 2I). A similar lack of effect on cell survival has been observed after chronic mild stress in rats (Heine et al., 2004Heine V.M. Maslam S. Joels M. Lucassen P.J. Prominent decline of newborn cell proliferation, differentiation, and apoptosis in the aging dentate gyrus, in absence of an age-related hypothalamus-pituitary-adrenal axis activation.Neurobiol. Aging. 2004; 25: 361-375Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (263) Google Scholar, Airan et al., 2007Airan R.D. Meltzer L.A. Roy M. Gong Y. Chen H. Deisseroth K. High-speed imaging reveals neurophysiological links to behavior in an animal model of depression.Science. 2007; 317: 819-823Crossref PubMed Scopus (313) Google Scholar). Furthermore, as we previously described, chronic fluoxetine increased the number of doublecortin-positive cells with tertiary dendrites and the maturation index in control animals (Figures 2H and 2I) (Wang et al., 2008Wang J.W. David D.J. Monckton J.E. Battaglia F. Hen R. Chronic fluoxetine stimulates maturation and synaptic plasticity of adult-born hippocampal granule cells.J. Neurosci. 2008; 28: 1374-1384Crossref PubMed Scopus (386) Google Scholar). However, the effect of fluoxetine is more pronounced in the presence of corticosterone when assessing survival (Figure 2B, two-way ANOVA with significant effect of treatment factor, ∗p < 0.05) as well as when counting the number of doublecortin-positive cells and assessing their dendritic morphology [Figure 2G; significant effect of treatment factor [∗∗p < 0.01]; Figure 2H; two-way ANOVA with significant effect of treatment factor [∗∗p < 0.01]). These results indicate that antidepressants stimulate all stages of adult neurogenesis in an animal model of an anxiety/depression-like phenotype. To assess whether adult neurogenesis is required for the antidepressant-mediated reversal of chronic corticosterone treatment in several behavioral tasks, we next submitted animals to focal hippocampal X-irradiation prior to a chronic corticosterone regimen alone or in combination with fluoxetine (see timeline, Figure S1). In the OF paradigm, the complete loss of hippocampal neurogenesis did not impact the anxiety/depression-like effects of chronic corticosterone. Moreover, the efficacy of fluoxetine was not modified in irradiated mice for all the OF parameters tested (Figures 3A–3D). Thus, the total decrease in the time spent in the center (sham: 144.7 ± 16.2 s; X-ray: 143.2 ± 18.4 s in corticosterone-treated animals), the total number of entries (sham: 285 ± 45.1; X-ray: 275.2 ± 40.1 in corticosterone-treated animals), and the ratio of center/total distance traveled (sham: 17.9% ± 4.4%; X-ray: 13.2% ± 3.2% in corticosterone-treated animals) for all sessions after 7 weeks of corticosterone treatment were reversed by chronic fluoxetine treatment regardless of whether the mice were exposed to X-irradiation (Figures 3A–3D; two-way ANOVA with significant treatment factor [∗p < 0.05]). In contrast, the effects of fluoxetine to reverse the anxiety/depressive-like state induced by chronic corticosterone in the NSF paradigm was completely abolished with hippocampal irradation (from 371.3 ± 50.29 s in sham corticosterone/fluoxetine group to 546.2 ± 36.5 s in irradiated corticosterone/fluoxetine group) (Figures 3E and 3G; two-way ANOVA with significant interaction between irradiation and treatment [∗∗p < 0.01]), suggesting a dependence on adult hippocampal neurogenesis. Home cage food consumption was not affected by fluoxetine or irradiation (Figure 3F). In the mouse FST, the fluoxetine-induced decrease in immobility duration in corticosterone-treated animals was not affected by focal irradiation (Figure 3H). Taken together, these results demonstrate that hippocampal neurogenesis is required for the behavioral activity of fluoxetine in the NSF test but not in the OF and FST, suggesting distinct underlying mechanisms. Interestingly, this report indicates that fluoxetine mediates its effects through distinct neurogenesis-dependent and -independent mechanisms. A recent report has suggested that antidepressants utilize both mechanisms, but fluoxetine was suggested to be neurogenesis dependent while distinct compounds that are V1B and corticotropin-releasing factor type 1 (CRF1) antagonists were suggested to be neurogenesis-independent (Surget et al., 2008Surget A. Saxe M. Leman S. Ibarguen-Vargas Y. Chalon S. Griebel G. Hen R. Belzung C. Drug-Dependent Requirement of Hippocampal Neurogenesis in a Model of Depression and of Antidepressant Reversal.Biol. Psychiatry. 2008; 64: 293-301Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (392) Google Scholar). We next wanted to further explore the distinct neurogenesis-dependent and -independent mechanisms responsible for the anxiolytic/antidepressant-like activity of fluoxetine. To this end, we used a candidate-based approach to assess whether there were changes in the expression of genes previously linked to mood disorders (Avissar et al., 2004Avissar S. Matuzany-Ruban A. Tzukert K. Schreiber G. Beta-arrestin-1 levels: reduced in leukocytes of patients with depression and elevated by antidepressants in rat brain.Am. J.

Among a panel of more than 20 genes involved in mood disorders, we only found 3 that were changed in our corticosterone model. Long-term exposure to corticosterone (35 ug/ml/day) significantly decreased β-arrestin 1 expression in the hypothalamus and there was a similar trend in the amygdala (Figures 4A and 4D), but exposure did not affect expression in the hippocampus (Figure 4G) (one-way ANOVA for gene expression in the hypothalamus [∗∗p < 0.01]). Expression of Giα2 is also significantly decreased with chronic corticosterone treatment in the hypothalamus and the amygdala (Figures 4C and 4F) (one-way ANOVA for gene expression in the hypothalamus and the amygdala [∗∗p < 0.01]). Interestingly, the decrease of β-arrestin 1 (Figure 4A) and Giα2 (Figure 4C) gene expression after 7 weeks of corticosterone treatment was totally reversed by chronic fluoxetine treatment in the hypothalamus, but not in the amygdala and the hippocampus (Figures 4D, 4F, 4G, and 4I) (one-way ANOVA for gene expression in the hypothalamus [∗∗p < 0.01]). We also found that with β-arrestin 2 expression, a trend of decreased expression (−16%) was reversed with fluoxetine treatment in the hypothalamus, but not in the amygdala (Figures 4B, 4E, and 4H) (corticosterone/vehicle group versus corticosterone/fluoxetine group in the hypothalamus [p < 0.05]). Interestingly, in the hippocampus, fluoxetine had an opposite effect on β-arrestin 2 levels (Figure 4H). From these three genes, we were particularly interested in β-arrestin 2 because the gene expression profile was affected differentially in the hippocampus and hypothalamus, which may indicate an involvement in neurogenesis-dependent and -independent effects of fluoxetine. Interestingly, β-arrestin 2 has been implicated in pathways associated with responsiveness to the mood stabilizer lithium (Beaulieu et al., 2008Beaulieu J.M. Marion S. Rodriguiz R.M. Medvedev I.O. Sotnikova T.D. Ghisi V. Wetsel W.C. Lefkowitz R.J. Gainetdinov R.R. Caron M.G.

The human brain is an immensely complex organ composed of billions of precisely interconnected neurons. The increase in both size and complexity of the brain, and in particular of the prefrontal cortex (PFC), defines us as a species more than any other evolutionary event (Kostovic, 1990Kostovic I.

The development of human brain circuitry depends on the diversity and precise spatiotemporal regulation of its transcriptome. Thus, it has long been postulated that changes in the transcriptional regulation of key developmentally expressed genes contributed significantly to the evolution of human brain uniqueness (King and Wilson, 1975King M.C.

Such changes are thought to have led to the creation of new combinatorial expression patterns from a relatively limited set of genes, and ultimately to the formation of distinct neuronal circuits that fostered the emergence of higher cognitive skills. One essential mechanism for increasing the spatiotemporal complexity of the transcriptome is alternative splicing (AS), which generates multiple mRNA transcripts from a single gene. It has been estimated that 70% or more of human multiexon genes are alternatively spliced (Johnson et al., 2003Johnson J.M. Castle J. Garrett-Engele P. Kan Z. Loerch P.M. Armour C.D. Santos R. Schadt E.E. Stoughton R. Shoemaker D.D. Genome-wide survey of human alternative pre-mRNA splicing with exon junction microarrays.Science. 2003; 302: 2141-2144Crossref PubMed Scopus (1152) Google Scholar) and that the majority of splicing events are regulated in a tissue-specific manner (Clark et al., 2007Clark T.A. Schweitzer A.C. Chen T.X. Staples M.K. Lu G. Wang H. Williams A. Blume J.E. Discovery of tissue-specific exons using comprehensive human exon microarrays.Genome Biol. 2007; 8: R64Crossref PubMed Scopus (227) Google Scholar). Moreover, in the adult human, the brain expresses more alternatively spliced transcripts than any other tissue (Yeo et al., 2004Yeo G. Holste D. Kreiman G. Burge C. Variation in alternative splicing across human tissues.Genome Biol. 2004; 5: R74Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), and the importance of specific AS programs to a number of neurodevelopmental and neurological processes has been recognized (Licatalosi and Darnell, 2006Licatalosi D.D.

Zhang Y. Fu X. PTB/nPTB switch: a post-transcriptional mechanism for programming neuronal differentiation.Genes Dev. 2007; 21: 1573-1577Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). Perhaps most intriguingly, AS has also been implicated as a significant source of evolutionary diversity between human and chimpanzee (Calarco et al., 2007Calarco J.A. Xing Y. Cáceres M. Calarco J.P. Xiao X. Pan Q. Lee C. Preuss T.M. Blencowe B.J. Global analysis of alternative splicing differences between humans and chimpanzees.Genes Dev. 2007; 21: 2963-2975Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar). Nevertheless, the extent and spatial specificity of AS within the developing human brain have not yet been evaluated. The evolution of the human brain not only provided us with remarkable cognitive and motor abilities, but might also have increased our susceptibility to a spectrum of neurological and psychiatric disorders. Substantial evidence suggests that the symptoms of many human brain disorders are dramatically influenced by pre-existing regional molecular profiles and neuronal circuitry (Morrison and Hof, 1997Morrison J.H. Hof P.R. Life and death of neurons in the aging brain.Science. 1997; 278: 412-419Crossref PubMed Scopus (1041) Google Scholar). For example, schizophrenia and autism are linked to dysfunction of specific cortical circuits, in particular those of the PFC (Levitt, 2005Levitt P. Developmental neurobiology and clinical disorders: lost in translation?.Neuron. 2005; 46: 407-412Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). This suggests that such disorders are defined in part during development by differential gene expression determining regional differences in neuronal circuits. Despite these motivations, technological and practical limitations have until now precluded a spatially comprehensive transcriptome survey of the human brain during the prenatal period, when key gene expression differences responsible for the unique features of human brain development and evolution are prominent. In this study, we used whole-genome exon microarrays to survey the transcriptome of the human left and right cerebellum, thalamus, striatum, hippocampus, and nine neocortical areas at mid-fetal gestation, a crucial developmental period for the formation of neuronal circuits and the appearance of structural asymmetry in perisylvian neocortical areas. Through multifaceted analysis of these data, we identified regional, intraneocortical areal, and cell type-restricted patterns of differential gene expression, coordinated activity, and AS associated with various neurodevelopmental processes. In addition, we discovered a disproportionate association of differentially expressed genes with conserved putative cis-regulatory elements displaying human-specific accelerated evolution. Altogether, these data represent a unique and crucial resource, and provide biologically relevant insights into the genetic and molecular mechanisms underlying the development, evolution, and increased disease susceptibility of the human brain. The late mid-fetal stage is a crucial developmental period encompassing multiple cellular processes that are essential to the development of the human brain (Kostovic, 1990Kostovic I. Structural and histochemical reorganization of the human prefrontal cortex during perinatal and postnatal life.Prog. Brain Res. 1990; 85: 223-239Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, Bystron et al., 2008Bystron I. Blakemore C. Rakic P. Development of the human cerebral cortex: Boulder Committee revisited.Nat. Rev.

Cortex. 2009; (Published online February 20, 2009)https://doi.org/10.1093/cercor/bhp009Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar), and which have also likely undergone substantial evolutionary changes. The regions depicted schematically in Figure 1A, representing five major embryonic brain regions, were microdissected from left and right sides of four late mid-fetal human brains (18, 19, 21, and 23 weeks of gestation [wg]). Samples included cerebellum (CBL), thalamus (THM), striatum (STR), hippocampus (HIP), and nine areas of neocortex (NCTX) individually representing the major sensory and association cortices, with the exception of the somatosensory and motor cortices, which cannot be reliably distinguished at this fetal stage and were therefore combined into one “motor-somatosensory” (MS) sample. Furthermore, we sampled four distinct areas of PFC: orbital (OPFC), dorsolateral (DLPFC), medial (MPFC), and ventrolateral (VLPFC). For complete details of tissue sources and specimens, see Table S1 in the Supplemental Data available with this article online. Tissue remaining after microdissection was fixed and analyzed for possible neuropathological defects and the presence of all major neuronal and glial cell types present at this developmental age (Figures S1 and S2 and data not shown). Genomic analysis with Illumina BeadChip whole-genome genotyping assays confirmed the absence of large-scale genomic structural defects such as aneuploidy. Furthermore, copy number variant (CNV) predictions for all four brains fell within the range of variation found in a sample of 120 well-characterized HapMap individuals, and the majority of predictions corresponded to known CNVs (Figure S3 and Table S2). Thus, by multiple measures, these brains did not exhibit any obvious signs of neurodevelopmental or genetic pathology. We hybridized RNA isolated from the regions illustrated in Figure 1A to Affymetrix GeneChip Human Exon 1.0 ST Arrays (“Exon Arrays”) to obtain independent genome-wide “whole transcript coverage” expression data from each of the four microdissected brains (Table S3). Probesets on the Exon Array are classified as Core, Extended, or Full according to the level of annotation of the source sequence(s); all analyses reported here utilized only the highest confidence “core” probesets, which are based on RefSeq and GenBank full-length mRNAs. Probesets are grouped into “transcript clusters” corresponding to all possible isoforms transcribed from a single locus or gene; therefore, for simplicity we refer to transcript clusters as genes throughout these results. Hybridization of selected samples to both Affymetrix U133 and Exon microarrays revealed comparable differential expression results between the two platforms (R2 > 0.5; Figure S4). In addition, we performed principal component analysis (PCA) to assess the consistency of Exon Array data within and between brain regions, in comparison to the variability across subjects or hybridizations (Figure S5). PCA confirmed that brain region, rather than individual differences, contributed the majority of variance to the data. Together, these results supported the validity of the Exon Array for comprehensive expression profiling of the mid-fetal human brain. We first analyzed gene expression and splicing differences across the five major embryonic brain divisions (NCTX, HIP, STR, THM, and CBL) represented in our samples. Out of 17,421 core transcripts, just under 76% (13,223) were present in at least one brain region, indicating that the great majority of human genes are significantly expressed in the developing brain (Figure 1B). Moreover, at a stringent false discovery rate (FDR) of 10−5, 4369 genes, or about 33% of those present, were differentially expressed (DEX). In addition, 3755 genes (28%) exhibited differential exon usage suggestive of region-dependent splicing (“differentially alternatively spliced,” DAS), for a combined 44% of expressed genes showing evidence of some form of differential regulation. A total of 2260 genes (17%) fell into both categories (DEX and DAS). Of particular note are 1495 genes, or 11% of those present, detected as DAS but not DEX, which represent a cohort of genes whose differential regulation across brain regions would not be detected by older 3′-biased array platforms. For our purposes, AS encompasses alternative promoter usage, polyadenylation site usage, and cassette exon splicing. Numbers of genes present, DEX, and DAS from all analyses are given in Table S4. To identify candidates for further study, we selected DEX genes (FDR < 10−5) with a minimum 2-fold difference in expression between any two brain regions and performed unsupervised hierarchical clustering on both genes and brain regions. We used the resulting heatmaps to identify groups of genes with the most specific or restricted expression patterns (Figure 2). In addition to large numbers of novel expression patterns, these clusters included transcription factors whose mouse orthologs are critical for the development of region-specific neuronal cell types, including FEZF2, SATB2, SOX5, and TBR1 in cortex, and TITF1 in STR (Sur and Rubenstein, 2005Sur M.

Correlations and sizes of these and all subsequent clusters are given in Table S5; complete lists of genes in these clusters are given in Table S6. Consistent with their ontogenetic and phylogenetic closeness and similar cellular composition, NCTX and HIP were the only two brain regions with a positive correlation (r = 0.13) across all of the genes clustered, as reflected in the 57 genes in cluster one enriched in both regions (Figure 2 and Tables S5 and S6). CBL was the most distinct of the brain regions sampled, consistent with previous findings in the adult human brain (Khaitovich et al., 2004Khaitovich P. Muetzel B. She X. Lachmann M. Hellmann I.

These data provide a survey of the proportions of the human transcriptome with broad or specific expression in the late mid-fetal brain, and identify a large number of regionally enriched or alternatively spliced genes not previously identified as such. In addition, the detection of many orthologs of important rodent neurodevelopmental genes suggests their human counterparts play evolutionarily conserved roles in establishing regional neuronal identity and connectivity. We next sought to validate some of these novel expression patterns by additional methods. Genes were prioritized by expression level, fold change, functional classification, and existing rodent and monkey data. Particular emphasis was placed on previously unknown or uncharacterized genes, and on those that appeared to differ in their regional enrichment from available data in other species. A total of 65 of 68 genes validated by quantitative real-time reverse-transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR) (bar graphs in Figure 2; Tables S6 and S9) correlated with Exon Array data (median r = 0.95), giving us extremely high confidence in Exon Array gene-level analysis. We further examined over 20 candidate genes by in situ hybridization (ISH) or immunohistochemistry (IHC) in whole sagittal or coronal sections of 13 additional mid-fetal human brains (Tables S1 and S6, Figure S6, and additional data available at www.humanbrainatlas.org). These confirmation data provide further confidence in the Exon Array platform, and identify an initial cohort of strong candidate genes for functional analyses. Next, we used a similar approach to search for areal differences in gene expression and splicing within the NCTX. Previous studies have found few differences between adult human neocortical areas (Khaitovich et al., 2004Khaitovich P. Muetzel B. She X. Lachmann M. Hellmann I. Dietzsch J. Steigele S. Do H.H. Weiss G. Enard W. et al.Regional patterns of gene expression in human and chimpanzee brains.Genome Res. 2004; 14: 1462-1473Crossref PubMed Scopus (235) Google Scholar, Roth et al., 2006Roth R.B. Hevezi P. Lee J. Willhite D. Lechner S.M. Foster A.C. Zlotnik A. Gene expression analyses reveal molecular relationships among 20 regions of the human CNS.Neurogenetics. 2006; 7: 67-80Crossref PubMed Scopus (247) Google Scholar). We hypothesized that developing NCTX would show more genetic differences, both because of the possibility of an increased number of genes expressed during development and because of the neuronal differentiation and establishment of connectivity that occur during the late mid-fetal period. Comparing among nine areas of NCTX and using the same FDR threshold as the previous analysis (10−5), we identified 471 DEX (4.1%) and 496 DAS (4.3%) genes from the total of 11,407 expressed (Table S4). We hypothesized that important gene expression differences among neocortical areas might be smaller in magnitude than those between brain regions, and thus relaxed the FDR to 1% for exploratory cluster analysis, yielding 1,753 DEX (15.4%) and 828 DAS (7.3%) genes (Figure 1C). Clustering revealed a clear division between the four PFC areas and the four non-frontal lobe areas (PAS, TAU, TAS, OCC) (Figure S7). Interestingly, the MS area, which was dissected from the border region of the frontal and parietal lobes, was not highly correlated with either prefrontal or nonfrontal areas. Rather, genes enriched in MS were roughly evenly divided into those correlated with PFC and those correlated with more posterior cortical areas (Figure S7), consistent with the mixed frontal/parietal nature of the tissue sample. In order to investigate both PFC- and non-frontal-enriched genes in greater detail, we performed two additional, targeted intra-NCTX analyses. First, we grouped together the four PFC samples and compared them to the remaining NCTX areas. Hierarchical clustering of DEX genes (Figure 3A and Tables S5 and S6) revealed, in addition to PFC- and non-frontal-enriched genes, more specific patterns of enrichment including TAU+TAS, PFC+TAS, and OCC. This analysis confirmed previous reports of enrichment of PCDH17 and CNTNAP2 (Figure 3B) in mid-fetal human frontal NCTX (Abrahams et al., 2007Abrahams B.S. Tentler D. Perederiy J.V. Oldham M.C. Coppola G. Geschwind D.H. Genome-wide analyses of human perisylvian cerebral cortical patterning.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2007; 104: 17849-17854Crossref PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar) and EPHA3 and EPHA7 (Table S9) in the fetal rhesus macaque monkey occipital and temporal NCTX, respectively (Sestan et al., 2001Sestan N. Rakic P. Donoghue M.J. Independent parcellation of the embryonic visual cortex and thalamus revealed by combinatorial Eph/ephrin gene expression.Curr. Biol. 2001; 11: 39-43Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). However, the vast majority of our results revealed a complexity of expression patterns in the developing NCTX that has not been previously recognized in either humans (see Table S11), nonhuman primates, or rodents (see Table S12). Next, we hypothesized that small but significant gene expression differences might exist among functionally distinct PFC areas during development. Thus, in our second targeted intra-NCTX analysis, we compared the four PFC areas and the MS sample that partially clustered with them (Figure 3B). This analysis yielded 233 DEX genes (2.1% of those present; FDR 1%; Tables S4 and S8), representing evidence for genetic differences between functionally distinct PFC areas in human or non-human primate developing brain. We found the most specific gene enrichment in OPFC, followed by MPFC; other clusters defined various combinations of PFC areas and MS. Interestingly, VLPFC, which encompasses the prospective Broca's speech area and its right hemisphere homolog, was more closely correlated to MS than to other prefrontal areas at this developmental stage (r = 0.36), suggesting a molecular similarity to the neighboring orofacial motor cortex controlling muscles involved in speech production. Moreover, genes enriched in VLPFC + MS included FOXP2 (Figure 3B, cluster 6), haploinsufficiency of which causes a severe speech and language disorder associated with morphological abnormalities and functional underactivation of Broca's area (Lai et al., 2003Lai C.S. Gerrelli D. Monaco A.P. Fisher S.E. Copp A.J.

This differential expression of FOXP2 within the human frontal lobe has not been observed in previous studies (Lai et al., 2003Lai C.S. Gerrelli D. Monaco A.P. Fisher S.E. Copp A.J.

Neurosci. 2004; 24: 3152-3163Crossref PubMed Scopus (251) Google Scholar), suggesting that the late mid-fetal stage might be a critical time-point for the role of this gene in establishing speech-related cortical circuitry. In addition, genes that clustered with FOXP2 might be candidates for further investigation in speech and language disorders (e.g., CNTNAP5, BCL6, C6orf206). Finally, this result prompted us to search more specifically for genes enriched in the perisylvian cortical region that encompasses future speech and language-related areas: VLPFC, MS, PAS, TAS, and TAU. An analysis contrasting these areas with the remaining NCTX samples identified many slightly but significantly enriched genes (Table S10). FOXP2 showed a modest 1.1-fold increase in perisylvian areas, whereas the greatest enrichment was found for TRPC7, TRPC4, and the unknown locus DKFZp547H025 (1.3- to 1.4-fold enrichment). In addition, NR4A2, which was 1.2-fold enriched in perisylvian areas, has previously been found to be enriched in mid-fetal temporal NCTX (Abrahams et al., 2007Abrahams B.S. Tentler D. Perederiy J.V. Oldham M.C. Coppola G. Geschwind D.H. Genome-wide analyses of human perisylvian cerebral cortical patterning.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2007; 104: 17849-17854Crossref PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar). These results suggest that despite being dispersed across the frontal, parietal, and temporal lobes, the combined perisylvian cortical areas might express a developmental genetic signature related to their common involvement in speech and language in humans. Altogether, these patterns of expression suggest genetic programs for the development of PFC and perisylvian areas involved in higher cognitive functions, and thus represent promising candidate genes for evolutionary and functional analyses. Genes identified as DEX within NCTX (Figure 3A) or PFC (Figure 3B) were chosen for further confirmation based on previous association with disorders such as autism, dyslexia, or speech and language impairments (e.g., CNTNAP2, ROBO1, FOXP2; Bakkaloglu et al., 2008Bakkaloglu B.

We validated 75 intra-NCTX DEX genes by qRT-PCR (bar graphs in Figure 3; Tables S7–S9), with a focus on PFC-enriched candidates, again finding a very high level of correlation between Exon Array and qRT-PCR results (median r > 0.9; median ANOVA p < 0.005). In addition, we confirmed 18 intra-NCTX DEX genes by ISH and/or IHC (Figure 4 and Table S9). These analyses revealed that despite the cellular heterogeneity of NCTX, Exon Array analysis was able to detect areal differences not only in genes exhibiting widespread expression within a neocortical area (Figure 4F), but also in genes whose expression differs in specific cell types, including astrocytes (Figure 4I), subplate neurons and marginal zone cells (Figure 4L), and cortical layer-specific neurons (Figure 4C). Thus, gene expression in various cell types contributes to neocortical areal molecular differences during development. The human brain exhibits structural and functional left-right differences, a prominent example of which is the interhemispheric asymmetry of perisylvian NCTX unde"
https://openalex.org/W2153227271,"Neurons recruited for local computations exhibit rhythmic activity at gamma frequencies. The amplitude and frequency of these oscillations are continuously modulated depending on stimulus and behavioral state. This modulation is believed to crucially control information flow across cortical areas. Here we report that in the rat hippocampus gamma oscillation amplitude and frequency vary rapidly, from one cycle to the next. Strikingly, the amplitude of one oscillation predicts the interval to the next. Using in vivo and in vitro whole-cell recordings, we identify the underlying mechanism. We show that cycle-by-cycle fluctuations in amplitude reflect changes in synaptic excitation spanning over an order of magnitude. Despite these rapid variations, synaptic excitation is immediately and proportionally counterbalanced by inhibition. These rapid adjustments in inhibition instantaneously modulate oscillation frequency. So, by rapidly balancing excitation with inhibition, the hippocampal network is able to swiftly modulate gamma oscillations over a wide band of frequencies."

Our intracellular studies of surround suppression in cat primary visual cortex (V1) provide strong evidence on this question. Although suppression has been thought to arise from an increase in lateral inhibition, we find that the inhibition that cells receive is reduced, not increased, by a surround stimulus. Instead, suppression is mediated by a withdrawal of excitation. Thalamic recordings and previous work show that these effects cannot be explained by a withdrawal of thalamic input. We find in theoretical work that this behavior can only arise if V1 operates as an inhibition-stabilized network (ISN), in which excitatory recurrence alone is strong enough to destabilize visual responses but feedback inhibition maintains stability. We confirm two strong tests of this scenario experimentally and show through simulation that observed cell-to-cell variability in surround effects, from facilitation to suppression, can arise naturally from variability in the ISN.

Considerable evidence suggests that stimulus selectivity in primary sensory cortex emerges largely from the organization of feed-forward thalamic connections (Bruno and Sakmann, 2006Bruno R.M.

And yet, anatomically, primary sensory cortex appears to be dominated by recurrent connections (Binzegger et al., 2004Binzegger T. Douglas R.J. Martin K.A.

Here, we demonstrate that the circuitry of primary visual cortex (V1) operates in a regime that may reconcile these two views. Theorists have proposed several functions for recurrent cortical connections. In attractor models of orientation selectivity in V1 (Ben-Yishai et al., 1995Ben-Yishai R. Bar-Or R.L. Sompolinsky H. Theory of orientation tuning in visual cortex.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 1995; 92: 3844-3848Crossref PubMed Scopus (732) Google Scholar, Somers et al., 1995Somers D.C. Nelson S.B. Sur M. An emergent model of orientation selectivity in cat visual cortical simple cells.J. Neurosci. 1995; 15: 5448-5465PubMed Google Scholar), strong excitatory recurrence constrains the set of stable cortical activity patterns (the network's “attractors”) to a small (low-dimensional) subset of the large (high-dimensional) set of all possible patterns. Which one appears in response to a stimulus is determined by a correspondingly low-dimensional subset of stimulus features, such as orientation or spatial frequency, while all other stimulus features are ignored. The degree to which V1 responses closely reflect feed-forward input, however, argues against this idea (Ferster and Miller, 2000Ferster D. Miller K.D.

Inhibition, spike threshold, and stimulus selectivity in primary visual cortex.Neuron. 2008; 57: 482-497Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (239) Google Scholar). In a second proposal, recurrent connections strongly amplify feed-forward inputs so that most of the stimulus-evoked depolarization in layer 4 neurons originates intracortically (Douglas et al., 1995Douglas R.J. Koch C. Mahowald M. Martin K.A. Suarez H.H. Recurrent excitation in neocortical circuits.Science. 1995; 269: 981-985Crossref PubMed Scopus (714) Google Scholar). Anatomically, thalamic inputs may constitute only a fraction of the total synapses in layer 4 of sensory cortex (Peters and Payne, 1993Peters A. Payne B.R. Numerical relationships between geniculocortical afferents and pyramidal cell modules in cat primary visual cortex.Cereb. Cortex. 1993; 3: 69-78Crossref PubMed Scopus (202) Google Scholar). Physiological experiments suggest, however, that recurrence only modestly amplifies (Chung and Ferster, 1998Chung S. Ferster D.

In a third proposal, strong recurrent excitation and inhibition tightly balance one another so that the net input to each neuron is only a fraction of either input alone (van Vreeswijk and Sompolinsky, 1998van Vreeswijk C. Sompolinsky H. Chaotic balanced state in a model of cortical circuits.Neural Comput. 1998; 10: 1321-1371Crossref PubMed Scopus (461) Google Scholar). This balance can explain the large variability of cortical spiking (Shadlen and Newsome, 1994Shadlen M.N. Newsome W.T. Noise, neural codes and cortical organization.Curr. Opin. Neurobiol. 1994; 4: 569-579Crossref PubMed Scopus (912) Google Scholar) and is consistent with the balanced changes in excitation and inhibition that may occur as activity states change (Haider et al., 2006Haider B. Duque A. Hasenstaub A.R. McCormick D.A. Neocortical network activity in vivo is generated through a dynamic balance of excitation and inhibition.J.

Neurosci. 2006; 26: 8267-8277Crossref PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar). Here, we provide evidence that, during visual stimulation, cat visual cortex operates as an inhibition-stabilized network (Tsodyks et al., 1997Tsodyks M.V. Skaggs W.E. Sejnowski T.J. McNaughton B.L. Paradoxical effects of external modulation of inhibitory interneurons.J. Neurosci. 1997; 17: 4382-4388PubMed Google Scholar), or ISN. In this regime, which includes the balanced network models, excitatory recurrence is so strong as to be unstable if inhibition is fixed, but is stabilized by inhibitory feedback. Experimental evidence for the ISN arises from our study of surround suppression. Although surround suppression is nominally a form of lateral inhibition, intracellular recordings failed to reveal the expected pattern of synaptic inputs. Only the ISN model can resolve this apparent paradox. In many cortical cells, stimuli surrounding the classical receptive field, or center, suppress spike responses to simultaneously presented center stimuli. The orientation tuning of this suppression (Cavanaugh et al., 2002Cavanaugh J.R. Bair W. Movshon J.A.

Time course and time-distance relationships for surround suppression in macaque V1 neurons.J. Neurosci. 2003; 23: 7690-7701PubMed Google Scholar) all suggest that suppression originates intracortically, through local horizontal connections or feedback from higher areas. Since these connections are largely excitatory, however, they are typically assumed to act through local inhibitory interneurons to increase inhibition in surround-suppressed cells. We have found instead that surround stimuli decrease both the inhibition and excitation received by suppressed cells. We show that these decreases cannot be accounted for by suppression of input from the lateral geniculate nucleus (LGN) and therefore must arise from intracortical input. How can an increase of intracortical input to the local circuit decrease both excitation and inhibition? Previous work has established that an ISN can lead to such a decrease (Tsodyks et al., 1997Tsodyks M.V. Skaggs W.E. Sejnowski T.J. McNaughton B.L. Paradoxical effects of external modulation of inhibitory interneurons.J. Neurosci. 1997; 17: 4382-4388PubMed Google Scholar), and we show theoretically that an ISN is the only solution to this apparent paradox. In addition, we test and confirm two predictions of the ISN model regarding the time course of surround-evoked inhibition and the source of synaptic input to surround-suppressed cells. The ISN provides a framework within which strong recurrence may be reconciled with feed-forward models of cortical selectivity. The ISN's strong recurrence can support complex computations (Latham and Nirenberg, 2004Latham P.E. Nirenberg S. Computing and stability in cortical networks.Neural Comput. 2004; 16: 1385-1412Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar), yet allow neuronal responses to change smoothly with changing feed-forward input, and thus reflect the full, high-dimensional space of possible input patterns. Feed-forward inputs may determine neuronal tuning to a center stimulus, whereas the local recurrent circuitry helps set the gain through the balance between strong excitation and stabilizing inhibition. This balance may in turn be modulated by stimulus context, cortical state changes, or top-down influences. Cortical cells were classified as surround suppressed if an increase in stimulus size beyond the classical receptive field caused a statistically significant reduction in firing rate (Experimental Procedures). In the simple cell in Figure 1, a 10-fold increase in stimulus size reduced the spike response by >80% (F1 component; Figures 1A and 1B). The underlying reduction in membrane potential responses was much smaller (DC component, 40%; F1 component, 30%) and, like the spike responses, was selective for the orientation of the surround stimulus. A surround stimulus oriented 90° from the optimal evoked little suppression (Figure 1C). To investigate the mechanisms underlying this suppression (Figure 2), we measured stimulus-evoked changes in membrane conductance by injecting different levels of steady current into the cell (Figure 2B). Total membrane conductance (Figure 2C) was derived from the slope of the I-V relationship constructed at each point in time, and changes in excitatory and inhibitory conductance (Figures 2D and 2E) were derived from estimates of synaptic reversal potentials applied to the membrane equation (Anderson et al., 2000Anderson J.S. Carandini M. Ferster D. Orientation tuning of input conductance, excitation, and inhibition in cat primary visual cortex.J. Neurophysiol. 2000; 84: 909-926PubMed Google Scholar). Surprisingly, the surround stimulus reduced total conductance—and both the excitatory and inhibitory conductance—in an orientation-selective manner (Figure 2H). Membrane potential measurements were made from 67 cortical cells; conductance measurements were made in the 34 cells that showed surround suppression in their spike responses. For each of the four measures—firing rate, membrane potential, and excitatory and inhibitory conductance—we plotted response amplitude for center-plus-surround stimulation against that for center-only stimulation (Figure 3). In each plot, the amount of surround suppression for a given cell is indicated by how far each point lies below the diagonal. Several trends can be observed. First, as expected from previous extracellular studies (Cavanaugh et al., 2002Cavanaugh J.R. Bair W. Movshon J.A. Selectivity and spatial distribution of signals from the receptive field surround in macaque V1 neurons.J. Neurophysiol. 2002; 88: 2547-2556Crossref PubMed Scopus (307) Google Scholar, DeAngelis et al., 1994DeAngelis G.C. Freeman R.D. Ohzawa I.

Sadakane O. Akasaki T. Naito T. Shimegi S. Sato H. Relationship between excitation and inhibition underlying size tuning and contextual response modulation in the cat primary visual cortex.J. Neurosci. 2004; 24: 1428-1438Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar), suppression in firing rate and membrane potential is much greater for the iso-oriented surround (Figures 3A and 3B) than for the cross-oriented surround (Figures 3E and 3F). Second, as it does for many other response properties (Priebe and Ferster, 2008Priebe N.J. Ferster D. Inhibition, spike threshold, and stimulus selectivity in primary visual cortex.Neuron. 2008; 57: 482-497Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (239) Google Scholar), including length tuning (Anderson et al., 2001Anderson J.S. Lampl I. Gillespie D.C. Ferster D. Membrane potential and conductance changes underlying length tuning of cells in cat primary visual cortex.J. Neurosci. 2001; 21: 2104-2112PubMed Google Scholar), spike threshold generally amplifies surround suppression and its sensitivity to orientation, size, and contrast in spike responses relative to membrane potential responses (Figures 3A, 3B, S1, and S2). This effect is quantified and fit to a power-law threshold nonlinearity in Figure S3. Third, in surround-suppressed cells, iso-oriented surround stimulation on average caused a reduction in both excitation and inhibition (51% and 38%; Figures 3C and 3D) rather than the increase in inhibition expected from standard models of lateral inhibition. Excitation was reduced by >25% in 85% of surround-suppressed cells; inhibition was reduced by >25% in 65% of such cells. These conductance measurements were not likely distorted by action potentials, since similar results were obtained when voltage-gated Na+ and K+ channels (and GABAB-mediated inhibition) were blocked with intracellular QX-314 and Cs+ (Figures 3C and 3D, closed symbols; Figure S4). Fourth, both excitation and inhibition are tuned for surround orientation (Figure S5), but the tuning was stronger for excitation than for inhibition. Changing the surround from iso- to cross-orientation reduced excitatory suppression in 21 of 23 cells (one-sided binomial test, p < 0.0001); over all cells, average suppression fell from 54% (Figure 3C) to 24% (Figure 3G) (one-sided paired t test, p < 0.0001). Changing the surround orientation reduced inhibitory suppression in 16 of 23 cells (p < 0.05); average suppression fell from 42% (Figure 3D) to 27% (Figure 3H) (p < 0.06). The standard lateral inhibition models make a critical prediction regarding the synaptic inputs underlying surround suppression—that suppression in membrane potential is driven by, and therefore should be strongly correlated with, an increase in inhibition. To test this prediction, we plotted suppression in membrane potential against suppression in excitation and inhibition (Figures 4A and 4B), quantifying suppression using a suppression index: the percentage by which the surround stimulus decreases the response to the center stimulus (SI = 1 – Rcenter+surround/Rcenter). SI = 0 represents no suppression, SI = 1 represents complete suppression, SI > 1 represents suppression below the spontaneous level, and SI < 0 represents facilitation. Using this measure, the standard lateral inhibition models would predict that the points in Figure 4B fall along a line of negative slope and intercept 0. In contrast to this prediction, suppression in membrane potential was not at all correlated with an increase in inhibition (Figure 4B, r = 0.08, p > 0.54). Instead, suppression in membrane potential was strongly correlated with—and thus appears to be driven by—a decrease in excitation (Figure 4A, r = 0.80, p < 0.00001). The lack of negative correlation between SI of membrane potential and SI of inhibition seems surprising. This expected negative correlation may be counteracted, however, by a positive correlation in suppressed cells between suppression in excitation and suppression in inhibition (Figure 7, below) that arises because a more strongly suppressive stimulus more strongly reduces all synaptic inputs. If a decrease in excitation—rather than an increase in inhibition—drives surround suppression, what drives the decrease in excitation? One possibility is a withdrawal of feed-forward input from LGN cells, which themselves show surround suppression (Bonin et al., 2005Bonin V. Mante V. Carandini M.

Orientation bias of the extraclassical receptive field of the relay cells in the cat's dorsal lateral geniculate nucleus.Neuroscience. 2004; 125: 495-505Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). To test this possibility, we asked whether the strength, orientation selectivity, and size tuning of surround suppression in LGN cells match those of cortical simple cells, which receive a substantial portion of their input from the LGN. To study how LGN responses change during cortical surround suppression, it is important to use the same stimuli in LGN and cortex. The center stimuli we used for measuring suppression in cortical cells were, by definition, optimal in size for these cells, and were therefore two to three times larger than the centers of geniculate receptive fields at comparable retinal eccentricities (<5°). These stimuli by themselves generate significant surround suppression in LGN cells (Jones et al., 2000Jones H.E. Andolina I.M. Oakely N.M. Murphy P.C. Sillito A.M. Spatial summation in lateral geniculate nucleus and visual cortex.Exp. Brain Res. 2000; 135: 279-284Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). As a result, the surround suppression that we observed in LGN cells using center stimuli optimized for cortex was much weaker and less orientation selective than in a previous study using center stimuli optimized for the LGN (Naito et al., 2007Naito T. Sadakane O. Okamoto M. Sato H. Orientation tuning of surround suppression in lateral geniculate nucleus and primary visual cortex of cat.Neuroscience. 2007; 149: 962-975Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). Nevertheless, these stimuli are most appropriate for understanding the changes in thalamic input generated during cortical surround suppression. Spike responses were recorded from 18 LGN cells (13 X and 5 Y) using center stimuli at two orthogonal orientations and surround stimuli at seven orientations relative to the center. From these responses, we calculated normalized and averaged responses across cells as a function of surround orientation (Figures 5A and S6) and plotted suppression indices (SI) for iso- and cross-oriented surround stimuli against one another (Figure 5D). For comparison, similar plots were constructed for the membrane potential and excitatory synaptic input to simple cells (Figures 5B and 5E, 5C and 5F). None of the properties of surround suppression in the LGN matched those of suppression in the cortex. First, the amplitude of suppression generated by an iso-oriented surround is far smaller for LGN cells (20%) than it is for the membrane potential (42%; Wilcoxon, p < 0.001) or excitatory conductance (48%; p < 0.001) of surround-suppressed simple cells, as can be seen by comparing the 0° points in Figures 5A, 5B (black), and 5C. The surround-induced reduction in LGN responses is more similar to the 8% reduction in membrane potential responses of nonsuppressed cortical cells (Figure 5B, cyan), though significantly different (p < 0.05). Second, the orientation tuning of surround suppression is much weaker in LGN cells than it is in cortical cells (Figures 5A–5C). Orientation selectivity for individual cells can be seen in plots of suppression index for cross-orientation (SIcross) against the index for iso-orientation (SIiso). In the LGN, these two measures are strongly correlated; that is, SI is similar at iso- and cross-orientation (Figure 5D, r = 0.66, p < 0.004). In the cortex, the correlation is weak; that is, SI is much stronger at the iso-orientation than at the cross-orientation (Figure 5E, r = 0.22, p > 0.14; Figure 5F, r = 0.36, p > 0.20). Third, size tuning is much narrower in LGN cells than it is in cortical cells (Jones et al., 2000Jones H.E. Andolina I.M. Oakely N.M. Murphy P.C. Sillito A.M. Spatial summation in lateral geniculate nucleus and visual cortex.Exp. Brain Res. 2000; 135: 279-284Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). Starting with optimal center stimuli for LGN cells (0.4°–2° in diameter), half-maximal suppression occurred with annuli of 1°–2° in thickness (data not shown). By contrast, for simple cells, optimal center stimuli were 2°–4° in diameter and half-maximal suppression occurred for annuli of 2°–5° in thickness (Figure S1). In other words, for the center stimuli used in the cortex, geniculate neurons are already almost maximally surround suppressed. Note that when stimuli with optimal sizes for LGN cells were presented, surround suppression was stronger but less tuned to surround orientation (iso-orientation: 49%; cross-orientation: 47%), in accordance with previous studies. Together, these observations—that geniculate surround suppression is substantially weaker, less orientation tuned, and peaks at smaller stimulus diameters than cortical suppression—make it unlikely that the LGN is the source of the strong, orientation-selective surround suppression in the cortex. To understand the possible mechanisms underlying these experimental results, we explored the behavior of simple mathematical models of the cortical circuit and found that only one cortical architecture can explain the surround-induced reduction in excitation and inhibition: an inhibition-stabilized network, or ISN (Tsodyks et al., 1997Tsodyks M.V. Skaggs W.E. Sejnowski T.J. McNaughton B.L. Paradoxical effects of external modulation of inhibitory interneurons.J. Neurosci. 1997; 17: 4382-4388PubMed Google Scholar). We first modeled a cortical orientation column with two populations of cells (Figure 6A), one excitatory (E) and one inhibitory (I), each making recurrent connections onto themselves and reciprocal connections onto each other (Tsodyks et al., 1997Tsodyks M.V.

J. 1972; 12: 1-24Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2029) Google Scholar). The column also receives external input from two sources: center stimuli activate the E and I cells through feed-forward inputs from the LGN and/or other cortical cells; surround stimuli preferentially activate the I cells through lateral excitatory connections. These lateral connections could have several possible sources: layer 6 cells, which preferentially target inhibitory cells in layer 4 (McGuire et al., 1984McGuire B.A. Hornung J.P. Gilbert C.D.

https://openalex.org/W2167855218,"Jawless vertebrates use variable lymphocyte receptors (VLR) comprised of leucine-rich-repeat (LRR) segments as counterparts of the immunoglobulin-based receptors that jawed vertebrates use for antigen recognition. Highly diverse VLR genes are somatically assembled by the insertion of variable LRR sequences into incomplete germline VLRA and VLRB genes. Here we show that in sea lampreys (Petromyzon marinus) VLRA and VLRB anticipatory receptors are expressed by separate lymphocyte populations by monoallelic VLRA or VLRB assembly, together with expression of cytosine deaminase 1 (CDA1) or 2 (CDA2), respectively. Distinctive gene expression profiles for VLRA+ and VLRB+ lymphocytes resemble those of mammalian T and B cells. Although both the VLRA and the VLRB cells proliferate in response to antigenic stimulation, only the VLRB lymphocytes bind native antigens and differentiate into VLR antibody-secreting cells. Conversely, VLRA lymphocytes respond preferentially to a classical T-cell mitogen and upregulate the expression of the pro-inflammatory cytokine genes interleukin-17 (IL-17) and macrophage migration inhibitory factor (MIF). The finding of T-like and B-like lymphocytes in lampreys offers new insight into the evolution of adaptive immunity. Lampreys and hagfish, the last of the jawless vertebrates, attract the attention of immunologists as their adaptive immune system rivals that of humans in its flexibility. In humans, each lymphocyte expresses a unique anticipatory receptor for an antigen, constructed from variable, diversity and joining segments. Jawless vertebrates use variable lymphocyte receptors composed of leucine-rich-repeat protein segments with a non-varying stalk tethered to the lymphocyte surface. New work on the sea lamprey reveals yet more parallels with humans: they have a compartmentalized adaptive immune system containing cells that resemble cytokine-secreting T cells and antibody-secreting B cells of the mammalian adaptive immune system. This points to a split in lymphocyte differentiation along T- and B-like cell lineages much earlier in evolution than previously appreciated, such that their system was either a precursor of, or evolved alongside, our own immune system. Variable lymphocyte receptors (VLRs) are used for antigen recognition in jawless vertebrates. Distinctive gene expression profiles for VLRA+ and VLRB+ lymphocytes in lampreys are now shown to resemble those of mammalian T and B cells, offering insight into the evolution of adaptive immunity."

The reports further predict that ecosystems will take centuries to recover from damages if they recover at all. Accordingly, there is despair that we are passing on a legacy of irreparable damage to future generations which is entirely inconsistent with principles of sustainability. Methodology/Principal Findings We tested the prediction of irreparable harm using a synthesis of recovery times compiled from 240 independent studies reported in the scientific literature. We provide startling evidence that most ecosystems globally can, given human will, recover from very major perturbations on timescales of decades to half-centuries. Significance/Conclusions Accordingly, we find much hope that humankind can transition to more sustainable use of ecosystems."
https://openalex.org/W2162900910,"Background Synesthesia is a condition in which the stimulation of one sense elicits an additional experience, often in a different (i.e., unstimulated) sense. Although only a small proportion of the population is synesthetic, there is growing evidence to suggest that neurocognitively-normal individuals also experience some form of synesthetic association between the stimuli presented to different sensory modalities (i.e., between auditory pitch and visual size, where lower frequency tones are associated with large objects and higher frequency tones with small objects). While previous research has highlighted crossmodal interactions between synesthetically corresponding dimensions, the possible role of synesthetic associations in multisensory integration has not been considered previously. Methodology Here we investigate the effects of synesthetic associations by presenting pairs of asynchronous or spatially discrepant visual and auditory stimuli that were either synesthetically matched or mismatched. In a series of three psychophysical experiments, participants reported the relative temporal order of presentation or the relative spatial locations of the two stimuli. Principal Findings The reliability of non-synesthetic participants' estimates of both audiovisual temporal asynchrony and spatial discrepancy were lower for pairs of synesthetically matched as compared to synesthetically mismatched audiovisual stimuli. Conclusions Recent studies of multisensory integration have shown that the reduced reliability of perceptual estimates regarding intersensory conflicts constitutes the marker of a stronger coupling between the unisensory signals. Our results therefore indicate a stronger coupling of synesthetically matched vs. mismatched stimuli and provide the first psychophysical evidence that synesthetic congruency can promote multisensory integration. Synesthetic crossmodal correspondences therefore appear to play a crucial (if unacknowledged) role in the multisensory integration of auditory and visual information."

Fructose 2,6-bisphosphate (Fru-2,6-BP) is an allosteric activator of 6-phosphofructo-1-kinase (PFK-1), a rate-limiting enzyme and essential control point in glycolysis. The concentration of Fru-2,6-BP in mammalian cells is set by four 6-phosphofructo-2-kinase/fructose-2,6-bisphosphatases (PFKFB1-4), which interconvert fructose 6-phosphate and Fru-2,6-BP. The relative functions of the PFKFB3 and PFKFB4 enzymes are of particular interest because they are activated in human cancers and increased by mitogens and low oxygen. We examined the cellular localization of PFKFB3 and PFKFB4 and unexpectedly found that whereas PFKFB4 localized to the cytoplasm (i.e. the site of glycolysis), PFKFB3 localized to the nucleus. We then overexpressed PFKFB3 and observed no change in glucose metabolism but rather a marked increase in cell proliferation. These effects on proliferation were completely abrogated by mutating either the active site or nuclear localization residues of PFKFB3, demonstrating a requirement for nuclear delivery of Fru-2,6-BP. Using protein array analyses, we then found that ectopic expression of PFKFB3 increased the expression of several key cell cycle proteins, including cyclin-dependent kinase (Cdk)-1, Cdc25C, and cyclin D3 and decreased the expression of the cell cycle inhibitor p27, a universal inhibitor of Cdk-1 and the cell cycle. We also observed that the addition of Fru-2,6-BP to HeLa cell lysates increased the phosphorylation of the Cdk-specific Thr-187 site of p27. Taken together, these observations demonstrate an unexpected role for PFKFB3 in nuclear signaling and indicate that Fru-2,6-BP may couple the activation of glucose metabolism with cell proliferation."
https://openalex.org/W1996553105,"We investigated how experience regulates the structure of a defined neuronal circuit in adult mice. Enriched environment (EE) produced a robust and reversible increase in hippocampal stratum lucidum synapse numbers, mossy fiber terminal (LMT) numbers, and spine plus synapse densities at LMTs, whereas a distinct mechanism depending on Rab3a promoted LMT volume growth. In parallel, EE increased postsynaptic CA3 pyramidal neuron Wnt7a/b levels. Inhibiting Wnt signaling through locally applied sFRP-1 suppressed the effects of EE on synapse numbers and further reduced synapse numbers in control mice. Wnt7 applied to CA3 mimicked the effects of EE on synapse and LMT numbers. CA3 Wnt7a/b levels were enhanced by excitatory activity and reduced by sFRP-1. Synapse numbers and Wnt7a/b levels peaked in mice aged 6–12 months; a decline in aged mice was reversed by EE. Therefore, behavioral experience specifically regulates adult global stratum lucidum synapse numbers and hippocampal network structure through Wnt signaling."

Information processing and control capabilities of nervous systems depend on a diversity of transmitter release properties. Synapses can be strong but depress rapidly, or facilitate powerfully from near silence, with important consequences for circuit function. Presynaptic terminals of crustacean NMJs are well suited for electrophysiological recording, biochemical manipulation, and fluorescent tracking of chemical mediators. “Phasic” and “tonic” motor neuron junctions at crayfish leg extensor muscles differ 1000-fold in initial efficacy—phasic synapses depress while transmission at tonic synapses can grow 1000-fold during normal activity. These fast glutamatergic junctions span the range of short-term synaptic plasticity observed at vertebrate central synapses (Atwood and Karunanithi, 2002Atwood H.L. Karunanithi S.

Previous analysis was limited by the paucity of quantitative data on plasticity at these junctions. Here we characterize phasic depression and tonic facilitation and the time courses of synchronous and asynchronous transmitter release. We offer a comprehensive model simulating these characteristics.

Release in Normal Medium. In normal van Harreveld's (NVH) solution, focal extracellular recordings from a presynaptic bouton (Figure 1) show strong transmission with no failures but a drop in quantal content in successive responses (Bradacs et al., 1997Bradacs H.

Average quantal amplitudes, recorded as miniature excitatory junctional currents (mEJCs), remain constant. Depression to five impulses at 100 Hz was modest, with quantal content falling 34% ± 30% (mean ± standard deviation [SD], n = 14). Responses toa five-spike 100 Hz train, recorded as focal extracellular potentials reporting postsynaptic current, in NVH. (A) Sample traces from one preparation; #, synchronous release; ∗, asynchronous release. (B) Average of 100 trials in the same preparation. (C) Averaged responses from 14 preparations (thin colored lines), with global average ± SD (thick gray line), predictions from a simple model of depletion from a single pool (thick blue line), or from two independent pools (thick green line), and simulations from our full model (dashed line). (D) Synchronous release rates during EJCs from one preparation, estimated by deconvolution of EJC with average mEJC; 0.1 ms bins (full dataset in Figure S1). (E) Asynchronous release rates from the same preparation, estimated by counting mEJCs between EJCs; 0.5 ms bins (full dataset in Figure S2). (F and G) Composite synchronous and asynchronous release rates from 11 synapses. An increased mEJC frequency follows synchronous multiquantal releases. We measured release rate during the synchronous release period (Figure 1D and Figure S1 [available online]) by deconvolution of averaged EJCs (Figure 1B) with averaged mEJCs. Asynchronous release was evaluated by counting single quanta (Figures 1E and S2). Figure 2A1 shows release rates estimated by both methods; Figure 2B magnifies asynchronous release and also plots ±1 SD. The methods agree where the measurements overlap. As synchronous release drops, asynchronous release grows in a train. Responses tofive stimuli at 100 Hz. (A1) Release rates averaged from 11 preparations estimated by deconvolution (black line) or by counting mEJPs (green line ± SD shown as light green area). Simulation 1 (dashed blue line, “fast buffer” diffusion constant [Df] of 0) and simulation 2 (solid red line, Df = 0.002 μm2/ms) rescaled to overlay peak rates (16.4 and 12.3 quanta/ms) on measured peak release rate (8.7/ms). (A2 and A4) Magnified synchronous release periods (gray regions in all panels) for first and fifth responses from (A1), showing measurements and simulation 2: the fifth response is broader (wider half width, horizontal dashed lines) and begins earlier than the first response. (B) Expansion of (A1) showing asynchronous release. (A3) Quantal contents (green bars, ±SD) and simulations (in blue for Df = 0 and red for Df = 0.002 μm2/ms); first quantal contents: 8.06 (experimental), 7.91 (simulation 1), and 9.21 (simulation 2). Quantal contents were calculated (Figure 2A3) by integrating release rate during the synchronous release period (defined in Experimental Procedures) and confirmed by dividing successive average EJC areas by average mEJC area. Quantal contents drop less (to 74.5% ± 26.9% of the first quantal content of 8.06 ± 6.80; Figure 2A3) than peak release rates (to 71.4% in Figure 2A1) because the half-width of synchronous release in the first response (Figure 2A2) is a bit less than for the fifth response (Figure 2A4). Depression in Cs+-Ringer. To characterize depression, we enhanced it by prolonging APs in a bathing medium with Cs+ substituted for K+ (Millar et al., 2002Millar A.G. Bradacs H. Charlton M.P. Atwood H.L. Inverse relationship between release probability and readily releasable vesicles in depressing and facilitating synapses.J. Neurosci. 2002; 22: 9661-9667PubMed Google Scholar). Responses to ten stimuli at 100 Hz were quite variable (Figure 3A), even if normalized to the first response (Figures S3A and S3B). Depression was negatively correlated with initial quantal content (p < 0.01, Spearman r = −0.83 for second and fifth EJCs, n = 9), as expected if it arises from vesicle depletion. Weaker synapses showed a net facilitation on the second response, whereas stronger synapses depressed the most. Restricting attention to four synapses of intermediate strength, depression was more uniform and uncorrelated with first EJC (block in Figure 3A). Average data from these synapses (solid gray lines in Figure S3v, A and B) had smaller SDs (Figure S3C), especially if normalized to the first response (Figure S3D). We regard these intermediate synapses as “typical” phasic synapses (Figure 3B). Growth of, and recovery from, depression at nine phasic synapses stimulated ten times at 100 Hz. (A) Correlation between depression of the second (squares, left ordinate) or fifth responses (triangles, right ordinate) and initial quantal content. Four synapses with intermediate depression uncorrelated (p > 0.05) with initial amplitude (symbols within box) were used for analysis. (B) Responses averaged from 20 trials for individual boutons (gray lines), means ± SDs for all synapses (black symbols), simple single-pool (blue line) and two-pool (green line) depletion models, and simulations of our model (solid red line); the latter is separated into release from willingly (W, dashed line) and reluctantly released (V, dotted line) pools. (C) Recovery from depression in five boutons (colored symbols, averages of 20 trials), showing double exponentials (r2 ≥ 0.97) fitted to each (colored lines). The global average (thick gray line) is a double exponential using parameters averaged from these fits (boxed values). Simulated recovery (black line) is separated into vesicle pools W (dashed line) and V (dotted line). For double-exponential fits, the amplitude and time constant of each exponential is indicated (±SDs for data; ±SEs for simulation parameters). (D) Cumulative quantal content from simulations (red symbols) used to estimate RRP (red line) from 20-AP 100 Hz train, and an example of experimental data (green symbols and line). Dashed line shows larger RRP estimated from simulation of total cumulative release, including asynchronous release. We studied recovery from depression in synapses in which the fifth response was between 32% and 40% of the first EJC, resembling our “typical” synapses. Conditioning trains were followed by stimuli at intervals from 5 ms to 4 s after the train (Figure 3C); recovery followed a double-exponential time course. Synaptic depression is usually attributed to depletion of one or more pools of vesicles available for release (collectively called the RRP). RRP is estimated by plotting cumulative quantal content in a train versus stimulus number and extrapolating to the ordinate the final slope when release has reached steady state (Schneggenburger et al., 1999Schneggenburger R. Meyer A.C. Neher E. Released fraction and total size of a pool of immediately available transmitter quanta at a calyx synapse.Neuron. 1999; 23: 399-409Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (423) Google Scholar). Pool-depletion models of depression require an estimate of RRP size. Our measurements of phasic RRP size fell between 10 and 75 (41 ± 23), similar to results of Millar et al., 2002Millar A.G. Bradacs H. Charlton M.P. Atwood H.L. Inverse relationship between release probability and readily releasable vesicles in depressing and facilitating synapses.J. Neurosci. 2002; 22: 9661-9667PubMed Google Scholar. Figure 3D shows a sample RRP determination. Tonic synapses are the opposite of phasic synapses—they start out nearly silent but facilitate tremendously. Focal recordings in NVH reveal occasional single-quantal responses to the first stimulus (quantal content 0.015 ± 0.011, corresponding to a probability of release per active zone of 0.00075 if there are 20 per bouton; Msghina et al., 1998Msghina M. Govind C.K. Atwood H.L. Synaptic structure and transmitter release in crustacean phasic and tonic motor neurons.J. Neurosci. 1998; 18: 1374-1382PubMed Google Scholar), whereas asynchronous release is virtually nonexistent (Figures 4A1 and 4A2); synchronous and asynchronous release grow strongly in subsequent responses. Overlapping quanta are extremely rare, so release rate may be estimated from histograms of synaptic delays to all quantal responses (Figures 4A3 and S4). Figure 4B1 shows average release time course (±SD). Quantal contents (Figure 4B3) were estimated by counting quanta in the synchronous release period and confirmed by dividing average EJC area by average mEJC area. Facilitation was defined as the fractional increase of the quantal content of a subsequent response, mn, compared with that of the first, m1, using Fn = mn/m1 − 1. Facilitation of quantal content (28.4 ± 14.4 for the fifth response, with a quantal content of 0.15 ± 0.11 for the first EJC) exceeded that of peak release rate (22.4 ± 13.4), due to broadening of the release period (Figures 4B2 and 4B4). Measured and simulated release from tonic synapses stimulated five times at 100 Hz in NVH.

(B2 and B4) Enlarged first and fifth responses, respectively, from (B1). (B3) Measured (means ± SDs) and predicted facilitation; measured m1 = 0.015 ± 0.011 (n = 13); simulated m1 = 0.012–0.013. Excitatory junctional potentials (EJPs) were also recorded intracellularly from the muscle fiber used for focal recording. Quantal contents were estimated by counting uniquantal responses for early stimuli (Figure S5B), while, for later stimuli, EJP amplitude (Figure S5A) was divided by average mEJP amplitude; when both methods could be used, they agreed closely. Facilitation derived from this data (Figure S5C) was similar to that from extracellular recordings. Figure 5A illustrates an accelerating accumulation of facilitation and its posttetanic biexponential decay in individual experiments; Figure 5B plots average behavior. Growth of, and recovery from, facilitation at tonic synapses stimulated five times at 100 Hz. (A) Data from 13 focal extracellular recordings (symbols, and thin colored lines, which for decay are two-exponential fits), compared with simulation (thick red lines). (B) Averaged results ±SDs (purple lines and symbols) and simulation (red lines); dashed lines show initial growth rates of facilitation, illustrating acceleration.

The components of fits are unrelated to vesicle pools in model simulations. Our model of synaptic transmission began with the scheme proposed by Millar et al., 2002Millar A.G. Bradacs H.

Neurosci. 2002; 22: 9661-9667PubMed Google Scholar, shown as grayed portions of Figure 6; they added a Ca2+-dependent priming process to the binding of five Ca2+ ions to synaptotagmin (Bollmann et al., 2000Bollmann J.H.

This scheme had six parameters: on and off rates (kon and koff) for synaptotagmin binding, a cooperativity factor b, a fusion rate γ, and on and off rates for the priming process, kprime and kupr. Ca2+ binding to C2A and C2B domains occurs independently but with identical kinetics (Chapman, 2008Chapman E.R. How does synaptotagmin trigger neurotransmitter release?.Annu. Rev.

The complete release scheme includes mobilization of vesicles from a reserve pool (R) to a docked, unprimed pool (U), molecular priming to vesicles unattached to a Ca2+ channel (V), and conversion to vesicles coupled to a Ca2+ channel (W). Primed vesicle pools are released by only one isoform of synaptotagmin binding three Ca2+ ions to C2A domains and two Ca2+ ions to C2B domains with positive cooperativity (reducing off-rates). Upon full binding, exocytosis occurs at rate γ. All transitions except exocytosis are reversible, and mobilization and priming are Ca dependent. A vesicle cannot be released from a vacated site for a time determined by refractoriness, implemented by reducing the priming or conversion rate in proportion to the fractional loss of vesicles in the pool from which exocytosis occurred.

The sketch indicates dimensions and locations of Ca2+ channels and vesicles in pools R, U, V, and W, the sites of Ca2+ action on those pools (small dots), and properties of endogenous buffers and uptake. We modified this scheme to encompass features of depression. We allowed for refilling pool U of docked but unprimed vesicles from a reserve pool, R. Mobilization of vesicles from R to U was made Ca dependent, as suggested for other preparations (Gomis et al., 1999Gomis A. Burrone J. Lagnado L.

This added two parameters, kmob and kdemob. Finally, instead of the number of unprimed (U) and primed (V) vesicles being fixed at average RRP sizes (Millar et al., 2002Millar A.G. Bradacs H.

We recorded from larger phasic boutons, similar in size to average tonic boutons, so we assumed 20 active zones per bouton (Msghina et al., 1998Msghina M. Govind C.K. Atwood H.L. Synaptic structure and transmitter release in crustacean phasic and tonic motor neurons.J.

Activity-induced changes in synaptic release sites at the crayfish neuromuscular junction.J. Neurosci. 1994; 14: 3688-3703Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) gives 12,000 vesicles per bouton. The dual-component nature of depression (Figures 3B and 3C) resembles that of vertebrate glutamatergic synapses (Neher and Sakaba, 2008Neher E. Sakaba T. Multiple roles of calcium ions in the regulation of neurotransmitter release.Neuron. 2008; 59: 861-872Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (568) Google Scholar). There, depression initially develops faster and then slower than a single exponential, as if two vesicle pools are depleted at different rates, due to different release probabilities, and depression also recovers with two time constants. After a short train depleting only the first pool, recovery proceeds at the slower rate, as if the willingly released pool recovers more slowly than the reluctantly released pool. Phasic junctions behave similarly, as shown by fits to single- and dual-pool models used for vertebrate synapses (Wölfel et al., 2007Wölfel M. Lou X. Schneggenburger R.

Each pool is characterized by a resting size S (dependent on filling and reverse rates k+ and k− from a fixed reserve pool), and a constant fraction F of that pool is released by each AP. Following stimulation, each pool recovers at rate k−. S, F, and k− of the one-pool model were derived by fitting an exponential to recovery and from quantal contents of the first two responses, m1 and m2 (see Supplemental Experimental Procedures). The six parameters of the dual-pool model required estimation of the steady state of depression as well as m1 and m2, two time constants of recovery, and the resting sizes of the two pools, SA and SB. Their sum was set to 58, the average RRP of phasic synapses (Millar et al., 2002Millar A.G. Bradacs H. Charlton M.P. Atwood H.L. Inverse relationship between release probability and readily releasable vesicles in depressing and facilitating synapses.J. Neurosci. 2002; 22: 9661-9667PubMed Google Scholar). Dual-pool models provided better fits to data from individual synapses (data not shown), as well as to composite data (Figures S3 and 3B). As at vertebrate synapses, the rapidly depleted pool was the slowest to recover. Rather than propose independent pools, we adopted the suggestion of Neher and Sakaba, 2008Neher E. Sakaba T. Multiple roles of calcium ions in the regulation of neurotransmitter release.Neuron. 2008; 59: 861-872Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (568) Google Scholar that puts the pools in series (Figure 6). The idea is that the first pool (V) consists of molecularly primed and releasable vesicles uncoupled from a Ca2+ channel, so that release probability to an AP is low. Vesicles in the second pool (W) are attached to a Ca2+ channel, where their exposure to higher [Ca2+]i increases release probability. If priming is faster than transit between pools V and W, which Neher and Sakaba, 2008Neher E. Sakaba T.

https://openalex.org/W2054014550,"A key feature of escape responses is the fast translation of sensory information into a coordinated motor output. In C. elegans, anterior touch initiates a backward escape response in which lateral head movements are suppressed. Here, we show that tyramine inhibits head movements and forward locomotion through the activation of a tyramine-gated chloride channel, LGC-55. lgc-55 mutant animals have defects in reversal behavior and fail to suppress head oscillations in response to anterior touch. lgc-55 is expressed in neurons and muscle cells that receive direct synaptic inputs from tyraminergic motor neurons. Therefore, tyramine can act as a classical inhibitory neurotransmitter. Activation of LGC-55 by tyramine coordinates the output of two distinct motor programs, locomotion and head movements that are critical for a C. elegans escape response."

Cell fate is dictated by the balance between pro- and antiapoptotic factors. Akt is one of these antiapoptotic factors, which must be activated through phosphorylation. The phosphorylation of Akt has previously been shown to be promoted by X-linked inhibitor of apoptosis protein (XIAP), another antiapoptotic protein dictating the fate of normal and cancer cells. However, the underlying mechanisms are poorly understood. We have observed that XIAP associates with PTEN (phosphatase and tensin homolog deleted on chromosome ten), the best characterized negative regulator of Akt phosphorylation, in vitro and in vivo. XIAP knockdown reduces constitutive mono- and polyubiquitination of PTEN, increases PTEN protein levels, and prevents nuclear accumulation of PTEN. Overexpression of XIAP induces polyubiquitination of PTEN and proteasome-dependent decrease of PTEN protein levels. RNA interference experiments showed that XIAP-induced regulation of Akt phosphorylation is PTEN-dependent. Additional experiments confirmed that XIAP also regulates PTEN in vivo; primary mouse embryonic fibroblasts derived from XIAP−/− mice contain higher levels of PTEN protein, less mono- and polyubiquitinated PTEN, and less nuclear PTEN than primary mouse embryonic fibroblasts derived from XIAP+/+ mice.

XIAP is also thought to promote Akt activity; we have previously reported that overexpression of XIAP promotes Akt phosphorylation in normal and cancerous ovarian cells (6Asselin E. Wang Y.

Similar to several other proteins, polyubiquitination of PTEN leads to proteasome-dependent degradation (12Wu W. Wang X. Zhang W. Reed W. Samet J.M. Whang Y.E. Ghio A.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 28258-28263Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar). Because XIAP has been shown to induce degradation of proapoptotic factors (4Morizane Y. Honda R. Fukami K. Yasuda H. J. Biochem. 2005; 137: 125-132Crossref PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar, 5Suzuki Y. Nakabayashi Y. Takahashi R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2001; 98: 8662-8667Crossref PubMed Scopus (545) Google Scholar), we hypothesized that XIAP promotes Akt phosphorylation by inducing PTEN degradation. Using in vitro and in vivo models, we have thus investigated whether XIAP regulates PTEN ubiquitination and content. Primary mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs) derived from XIAP+/+ and XIAP−/− mice were kindly provided by Dr. Philip A. Barker (McGill University, Montreal, Quebec, Canada). Human embryonic kidney fibroblastic cells HEK-293-T were a generous gift from Dr. Lionel Berthoux (University of Quebec, Trois-Rivières, Quebec, Canada). Human breast adenocarcinoma cell line MCF-7 and human cervical carcinoma cell line HeLa were purchased from the ATCC. XIAP plasmid constructs were a kind gift from Dr. Robert G. Korneluk (University of Ottawa Eye Institute, Ottawa, Ontario, Canada). Cells were seeded in 6-well plates at the required density to reach ∼75% confluency after 24 h. On the day of transfection, shRNAs (XIAP shRNA (5′-GCCACGCAGTCTACAAATTCT-3′) or control (scrambled) shRNA or PTEN shRNA (5′-GCAGCTAAAGGAAGTGAATCT-3′) or control (scrambled) shRNA) (all shRNAs inserted into pGeneClip (SABiosciences, Frederick, MD)) or XIAP constructs (Myc6-XIAP (WT), Myc6-XIAP-H467A (E3 ligase inactive mutant), or empty pcDNA3.1 vector (13Arora V.

Plates were incubated for 40 additional hours (total: 48 h) at 37 °C before cells were collected. Recombinant human XIAP (730 ng) (or deionized water as a control) and PTEN (200 ng) proteins were mixed in a 6-μl final volume and incubated on ice for 1 h. The remaining components for the ubiquitination reaction were then added: 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 5 mm MgCl2, 5 mm ATP, 2 μm ubiquitin aldehyde, 2 mm dithiothreitol, 15 mg of ubiquitin, 100 nm E1 enzyme, and 1 μm E2 enzyme (or deionized water as a control) (final reaction volume: 20 μl). Ubiquitination reaction was conducted for 1 h at 30 °C and stopped by adding 20 μl of 2× reducing sample buffer and by heating the samples for 5 min at 95 °C. Please see the supplemental materials for immunofluorescence, Western blot, and RT-PCR procedures. In accordance with a role for XIAP in promoting Akt activity, knockdown of XIAP using RNAi reduces the phosphorylation of Akt, as shown by a decrease of P-Akt levels when compared with total Akt levels (Fig. 1A). We have found that XIAP knockdown increased PTEN protein levels (Fig. 1A). Similar results were obtained using a small interfering RNA targeting a different sequence of XIAP (15Van Themsche C. Mathieu I. Parent S. Asselin E. J. Biol. Chem. 2007; 282: 4794-4802Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar) (supplemental Fig. S1A) and in other normal (HEK-293-T) or cancerous (HeLa) model cell lines (supplemental Fig. S1B). This indicates that XIAP down-regulates endogenous PTEN content, in various cell types. Akt phosphorylation is negatively regulated by PTEN (9Stambolic V. Suzuki A. de la Pompa J.L. Brothers G.M. Mirtsos C. Sasaki T. Ruland J. Penninger J.M. Siderovski D.P. Mak T.W. Cell. 1998; 95: 29-39Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2100) Google Scholar); in accordance, knockdown of PTEN using RNAi increases Akt phosphorylation (Fig. 1B). We found that RNAi-induced silencing of PTEN prevented XIAP knockdown from reducing Akt phosphorylation (Fig. 1B), indicating that regulation of PTEN content is necessary for XIAP to regulate Akt phosphorylation. We observed that overexpression of XIAP (Fig. 1C) or silencing of XIAP using RNAi (Fig. 1D) had no impact on PTEN transcript levels, indicating that XIAP does not regulate PTEN content at the transcriptional level. However, pretreating the cells with proteasome inhibitor MG-132 prevented a decrease of PTEN protein levels following overexpression of XIAP (Fig. 1E), indicating that XIAP negatively regulates PTEN content in a proteasome-dependent manner. Proteasomal degradation of PTEN protein is induced by its polyubiquitination (16Torres J. Pulido R. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 993-998Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (527) Google Scholar); we have thus investigated whether XIAP induces polyubiquitination of PTEN. Immunoprecipitation of ubiquitinated proteins using anti-ubiquitin antibody, followed by Western blot analysis using an anti-PTEN antibody, allows the visualization of mono- and polyubiquitination of PTEN protein in a given condition (Fig. 1F). Monoubiquitination of unrelated protein Smad4 (as described in Ref. 17Dupont S. Mamidi A. Cordenonsi M. Montagner M. Zacchigna L. Adorno M. Martello G. Stinchfield M.J. Soligo S. Morsut L. Inui M. Moro S. Modena N. Argenton F. Newfeld S.J. Piccolo S. Cell. 2009; 136: 123-135Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (392) Google Scholar) was monitored as a control. Using this approach, we found that although knockdown of XIAP in resting cells did not alter monoubiquitination of Smad4 (Fig. 1G), it reduced both monoubiquitination and polyubiquitination of PTEN (Fig. 1G). This indicates that XIAP constitutively regulates mono- and polyubiquitination of PTEN in resting cells. Reciprocally, vector-induced delivery of XIAP did not modify monoubiquitination of Smad4 but markedly increased polyubiquitination of PTEN (Fig. 1H), consistent with a proteasome-dependent decrease of PTEN protein levels following overexpression of XIAP (Fig. 1E). Because monoubiquitination of PTEN induces its nuclear import (11Trotman L.C. Wang X. Alimonti A. Chen Z. Teruya-Feldstein J. Yang H. Pavletich N.P. Carver B.S. Cordon-Cardo C. Erdjument-Bromage H.

Cell. 2007; 128: 141-156Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (585) Google Scholar), we have investigated whether XIAP, which constitutively promotes monoubiquitination of PTEN (Fig. 1G), regulates subcellular localization of PTEN. We found that following XIAP knockdown, PTEN protein levels were increased in the cytosol but were decreased in the nucleus (Fig. 1I). These results indicate that XIAP constitutively promotes nuclear localization of PTEN. On the contrary, overexpression of XIAP decreased total PTEN content in both the cytosol and the nucleus, with no apparent change in PTEN localization (Fig. 1J). This result is consistent with the observation that overexpression of XIAP did not increase monoubiquitination of PTEN (Fig. 1H). Wang et al. (18Wang X. Trotman L.C. Koppie T. Alimonti A. Chen Z. Gao Z. Wang J. Erdjument-Bromage H. Tempst P. Cordon-Cardo C. Pandolfi P.P. Jiang X. Cell. 2007; 128: 129-139Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (552) Google Scholar) have shown that NEDD4.1 could act as an E3 ubiquitin ligase for PTEN. In our model cell lines, knockdown (supplemental Fig. S2A) or overexpression (supplemental Fig. S2B) of XIAP did not modify NEDD4 protein levels, and knockdown of NEDD4 before overexpression of XIAP did not prevent XIAP-induced reduction of PTEN protein levels (supplemental Fig. S2C). Altogether, these observations indicate that an E3 ligase different from NEDD4 mediates XIAP-induced ubiquitination of PTEN. XIAP protein harbors a RING domain with E3 ubiquitin ligase activity (3Yang Y. Fang S. Jensen J.P. Weissman A.M. Ashwell J.D. Science. 2000; 288: 874-877Crossref PubMed Scopus (865) Google Scholar) and has previously been shown to polyubiquitinate proapoptotic proteins to induce their proteasomal degradation (4Morizane Y. Honda R. Fukami K. Yasuda H. J. Biochem. 2005; 137: 125-132Crossref PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar, 5Suzuki Y. Nakabayashi Y. Takahashi R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2001; 98: 8662-8667Crossref PubMed Scopus (545) Google Scholar). We have thus investigated whether XIAP could act as an E3 ligase for PTEN. Supporting this idea, only wild-type XIAP protein and not E3 ligase-inactive mutant XIAP protein induced polyubiquitination of PTEN and reduction of PTEN levels (Fig. 1H), indicating that E3 ligase activity of XIAP is required for the induction of polyubiquitination and degradation of PTEN. We also found that PTEN co-immunoprecipitates with XIAP (Fig. 2A) and that XIAP co-immunoprecipitates with PTEN (Fig. 2B) in multiple cell types (supplemental Fig. S3), indicating that XIAP and PTEN proteins associate in resting cells. Moreover, ubiquitinated PTEN proteins co-immunoprecipitated with XIAP (Fig. 2A), even under highly stringent conditions where 2% SDS is added to the cell lysates before immunoprecipitation (19Gallagher E. Enzler T. Matsuzawa A. Anzelon-Mills A. Otero D. Holzer R. Janssen E. Gao M. Karin M. Nat. Immunol. 2007; 8: 57-63Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar) (supplemental Fig. S4). Contrary to XIAP, NEDD4 did not co-immunoprecipitate with PTEN (supplemental Fig. S5A) or with XIAP (supplemental Fig. S5B), confirming that XIAP does not regulate PTEN ubiquitination by recruiting NEDD4 to a complex with PTEN. Finally, we have investigated whether XIAP could directly ubiquitinate PTEN, using in vitro ubiquitination assays. Commercially available recombinant PTEN protein that was used as a substrate already contained mono- and polyubiquitinated PTEN. In a first assay, recombinant XIAP and PTEN proteins were combined with the other reaction components except for E2 ubiquitin-conjugating enzyme, which was omitted in the control reaction, to allow specific monitoring of the ubiquitination of PTEN. The results showed increased levels of polyubiquitinated PTEN when E2 enzyme was present (Fig. 2C), showing that XIAP can ubiquitinate PTEN in vitro. To ensure that contaminating E3 ligase activity that could have been co-purified with PTEN was not already present in the recombinant PTEN protein mixture and responsible for the ubiquitination of PTEN (instead of XIAP), we also conducted ubiquitination assays comparing the ubiquitination of PTEN in the presence or in the absence of recombinant XIAP. The results showed increased polyubiquitination of PTEN in the reaction where XIAP was present (Fig. 2D). Altogether, these experiments indicate that XIAP can act as an E3 ubiquitin ligase for PTEN in vitro. We have used primary MEFs freshly derived from genetically engineered XIAP knock-out (XIAP−/−) mice or from control (XIAP+/+) mice to investigate whether XIAP also regulates PTEN protein in vivo. In primary MEFs derived from control XIAP+/+ mice, PTEN co-immunoprecipitated with XIAP (Fig. 2E) and XIAP co-immunoprecipitated with PTEN (Fig. 2F), confirming that PTEN and XIAP proteins also associate in vivo. Ubiquitinated PTEN proteins also co-immunoprecipitated with XIAP (Fig. 2E), even under highly stringent conditions (supplemental Fig. S4), suggesting that XIAP can also ubiquitinate PTEN in vivo. Total PTEN levels were increased in primary XIAP−/− MEFs when compared with corresponding XIAP+/+ MEFs (Fig. 2G), supporting a role for XIAP in negatively regulating PTEN content in vivo. In agreement, less polyubiquitinated PTEN was present in XIAP−/− cells when compared with XIAP+/+ cells (Fig. 2G), showing that XIAP regulates PTEN ubiquitination in vivo. Finally, less monoubiquitinated PTEN was detected in XIAP−/− MEFs when compared with XIAP+/+ MEFs (Fig. 2G). In agreement, we found intense nuclear immunostaining for PTEN in XIAP+/+ primary MEFs, which was absent in XIAP−/− MEFs, where PTEN mainly localized to the cytoplasm (Fig. 2H). These results indicate that XIAP also regulates PTEN localization in vivo. We have previously reported that TGF-β3, a cytokine widely expressed in normal and cancerous tissues, up-regulates XIAP and P-Akt levels in uterine cancer cells (15Van Themsche C. Mathieu I. Parent S. Asselin E. J. Biol. Chem. 2007; 282: 4794-4802Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). Here, we have investigated whether up-regulation of XIAP by TGF-β3 modifies PTEN ubiquitination, content, and localization in these cells. Following treatment with TGF-β3, less non-ubiquitinated but more ubiquitinated PTEN proteins co-immunoprecipitated with XIAP (supplemental Fig. S6A). In agreement, TGF-β3-induced up-regulation of XIAP was accompanied by a reduction of total PTEN content (supplemental Fig. S6B). XIAP knockdown prevented TGF-β3-induced decrease of PTEN content (supplemental Fig. S6C), showing that up-regulation of XIAP is responsible for the decrease of PTEN levels following exposure to TGF-β3. Down-regulation of PTEN was observed in both the cytosol and the nucleus of treated cells (supplemental Fig. S6D), and immunofluorescence analysis showed no difference between the subcellular localization of PTEN following exposure to TGF-β3 (supplemental Fig. S6E). This is consistent with our observation that overexpression of XIAP mostly increases polyubiquitination of PTEN in vitro (Fig. 1H) and modifies PTEN content but not its localization (Fig. 1, I and J). It is noteworthy that exposure to a physiological stimulus rapidly increasing Akt phosphorylation without increasing XIAP levels, namely IGF-1, was not associated with a modification of PTEN content (supplemental Fig. S6F) or of the levels of ubiquitinated PTEN co-immunoprecipitating with XIAP (supplemental Fig. S6G). Altogether, these results indicate that physiological stimuli that modify XIAP levels result in altered PTEN ubiquitination and content. The mechanisms and factors regulating PTEN ubiquitination only begin to be unraveled. We have found that XIAP regulates PTEN ubiquitination, content, and compartmentalization in vitro, and probably in vivo as it also occurs in primary cells freshly derived from mice. Previous studies support a role for XIAP in negatively regulating PTEN content in vitro and in vivo. Decrease of XIAP protein levels in cancer cells in response to the apoptosis-inducing agent mesalazine is accompanied, among others, by an increase of PTEN content (20Schwab M. Reynders V. Loitsch S. Shastri Y.M. Steinhilber D. Schröder O. Stein J. Carcinogenesis. 2008; 29: 1407-1414Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar), and exposure of mice to the apoptosis-inducing agent rosiglitazone modestly up-regulates PTEN protein levels in HCT116-XIAP+/+ cell-derived tumors but markedly increases PTEN content in HCT116-XIAP−/− cell-derived tumors (21Dai Y. Qiao L. Chan K.W. Zou B. Ma J. Lan H.Y. Gu Q. Li Z. Wang Y. Wong B.L. Wong B.C. Int. J. Cancer. 2008; 122: 2858-2863Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). These studies further suggest that XIAP can regulate PTEN content in response to non-physiological stimuli, and in compliance with those studies, we show here that physiological stimuli can regulate XIAP-PTEN interaction. It is likely that only physiological stimuli modifying XIAP levels impact Akt phosphorylation through the XIAP-PTEN axis because in the case of rapid induction of Akt phosphorylation in response to IGF-1, which was not accompanied by increased XIAP levels, no changes of PTEN content were observed. NEDD4.1 has already been identified as an E3 ubiquitin ligase(s) for PTEN (18Wang X. Trotman L.C. Koppie T. Alimonti A. Chen Z. Gao Z. Wang J. Erdjument-Bromage H. Tempst P. Cordon-Cardo C. Pandolfi P.P. Jiang X. Cell. 2007; 128: 129-139Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (552) Google Scholar); however, E3 ligases for PTEN different from NEDD4 could exist because PTEN ubiquitination has been reported to occur in the absence of NEDD4, in vitro and in vivo (22Fouladkou F. Landry T. Kawabe H. Neeb A. Lu C. Brose N. Stambolic V. Rotin D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2008; 105: 8585-8590Crossref PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar). Based on our findings that XIAP associates with PTEN as well as ubiquitinated PTEN proteins in vitro and in vivo and that XIAP can directly ubiquitinate PTEN in vitro, we propose that XIAP can act as an E3 ligase for PTEN. It is likely that multiple E3 ligases can act on PTEN, ensuring constant post-transcriptional control of its activity, depending on environmental conditions. We observed that although monoubiquitinated PTEN proteins co-immunoprecipitate with XIAP in resting cells and knockdown of XIAP decreases both monoubiquitination and polyubiquitination of PTEN, overexpression of XIAP or exposure to XIAP-inducing factors such as TGF-β3 only induces polyubiquitination of PTEN. It is therefore possible that XIAP preferentially mono- or polyubiquitinates PTEN depending on environmental conditions. Similarly, others have evidenced that different ubiquitin ligases could be responsible for mono- and polyubiquitination of another factor, Smad4, which translocates between the cytoplasm and the nucleus similar to PTEN (17Dupont S. Mamidi A. Cordenonsi M. Montagner M. Zacchigna L. Adorno M. Martello G. Stinchfield M.J. Soligo S. Morsut L. Inui M. Moro S. Modena N. Argenton F. Newfeld S.J. Piccolo S. Cell. 2009; 136: 123-135Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (392) Google Scholar). Thus, although we have gathered evidence demonstrating that NEDD4 was not involved in XIAP-induced ubiquitination of PTEN, regulation of PTEN stability and compartmentalization is probably not the sole responsibility of XIAP. In vivo, for example, mono- and polyubiquitination of PTEN can still be detected in XIAP KO mice. Because c-IAP1 and c-IAP2 are increased in XIAP KO cells (23Hwang C. Oetjen K.A. Kosoff D. Wojno K.J. Albertelli M.A. Dunn R.L. Robins D.M. Cooney K.A. Duckett C.S. Cell Death. Differ. 2008; 15: 831-840Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar) and because these enzymes have been shown to act as E3 ligases (24Huang H. Joazeiro C.A. Bonfoco E. Kamada S. Leverson J.D. Hunter T. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 26661-26664Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), cIAP-1 or cIAP-2 could possibly be involved in mono- and/or polyubiquitination PTEN. Nuclear localization of PTEN has been shown to be altered in human tumors, including prostate cancers (25Song M.S. Salmena L. Carracedo A. Egia A. Lo-Coco F. Teruya-Feldstein J. Pandolfi P.P. Nature. 2008; 455: 813-817Crossref PubMed Scopus (392) Google Scholar). By regulating PTEN compartmentalization, XIAP could thus be one of the factors influencing susceptibility to and/or progression of prostate cancer. Hwang et al. (23Hwang C. Oetjen K.A. Kosoff D. Wojno K.J. Albertelli M.A. Dunn R.L. Robins D.M. Cooney K.A. Duckett C.S. Cell Death. Differ. 2008; 15: 831-840Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar) observed no significant difference between XIAP WT and KO transgenic adenocarcinoma mouse prostate (TRAMP) mice for the onset and progression of prostate cancer; again, this could be due to a compensatory increase of c-IAP1 and c-IAP2 levels in XIAP KO cells (23Hwang C. Oetjen K.A. Kosoff D. Wojno K.J. Albertelli M.A. Dunn R.L. Robins D.M. Cooney K.A. Duckett C.S. Cell Death. Differ. 2008; 15: 831-840Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). They did report, however, a trend toward more aggressive disease in XIAP-deficient mice (23Hwang C. Oetjen K.A. Kosoff D. Wojno K.J. Albertelli M.A. Dunn R.L. Robins D.M. Cooney K.A. Duckett C.S. Cell Death. Differ. 2008; 15: 831-840Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar), which is consistent with reduced nuclear localization of PTEN in the absence of XIAP. The present study evidences a role for XIAP in down-regulating PTEN content and in promoting nuclear localization of PTEN. Because negative regulation of Akt phosphorylation only occurs when PTEN localizes to the cytoplasm (26Chung J.H. Eng C. Cancer Res. 2005; 65: 8096-8100Crossref PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar), the ability of XIAP to promote nuclear import of PTEN likely constitutes an additional mechanism through which XIAP promotes Akt phosphorylation/activity. Considering the emerging roles that are ascribed to PTEN and Akt in cellular processes other than apoptosis/survival (such as DNA repair (27Shen W.H. Balajee A.S. Wang J. Wu H. Eng C. Pandolfi P.P. Yin Y. Cell. 2007; 128: 157-170Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (782) Google Scholar)), the discovery of a role for XIAP in regulating the PTEN-Akt axis broadens the view of regulatory functions that can be attributed to XIAP.

This activation is mediated by a serine protease cascade leading to the processing of Spätzle, which generates the functional ligand of the Toll receptor. Recently, we identified three serine proteases mediating Toll pathway activation induced by lysine-type peptidoglycan of Gram-positive bacteria. However, the identities of the downstream serine protease components of Gram-negative-binding protein 3 (GNBP3), a receptor for a major cell wall component β-1,3-glucan of fungi, and their order of activation have not been characterized yet. Here, we identified three serine proteases that are required for Toll activation by β-1,3-glucan in the larvae of a large beetle, Tenebrio molitor. The first one is a modular serine protease functioning immediately downstream of GNBP3 that proteolytically activates the second one, a Spätzle-processing enzyme-activating enzyme that in turn activates the third serine protease, a Spätzle-processing enzyme. The active form of Spätzle-processing enzyme then cleaves Spätzle into the processed Spätzle as Toll ligand. In addition, we show that injection of β-1,3-glucan into Tenebrio larvae induces production of two antimicrobial peptides, Tenecin 1 and Tenecin 2, which are also inducible by injection of the active form of Spätzle-processing enzyme-activating enzyme or processed Spätzle.

Both the PGRP-SA/GNBP1 complex and GNBP3 are believed to mediate the activation of a serine protease cascade that ultimately leads to the cleavage of pro-Spätzle into processed Spätzle (5.Lemaitre B.

Cleaved Spätzle serves as a ligand for the cell membrane receptor Toll, and induces the production of AMPs by the fat body (8.Levashina E.A. Langley E. Green C. Gubb D. Ashburner M. Hoffmann J.A.

Serine protease cascades play very important roles in conveying and amplifying signals from pattern recognition receptors in the hemolymph (the insect blood) and lead to activation of the intracellular signaling pathway (23.LeMosy E.K.

BMB Rep. 2008; 41: 102-107Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). They involve the sequential activation of serine proteases and share similarity to the vertebrate complement system (13.Lemaitre B.

This large insect enabled us to collect large amount of hemolymph, allowing us to purify several different serine proteases. Our study demonstrated that the recognition of Lys-type PG by the PGRP-SA/GNBP1 complex activates Spätzle through the sequential activation of three different Tenebrio serine proteases: modular serine protease (MSP), Spätzle-processing enzyme-activating enzyme (SAE) and SPE (26.Kim C.H.

A recent study (9.El Chamy L. Leclerc V. Caldelari I. Reichhart J.M. Nat. Immunol. 2008; 9: 1165-1170Crossref PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar) showed that Drosophila Grass functioned as a common serine protease, which transferred signals recognizing both Gram-positive bacteria and fungi via the pattern recognition receptors Drosophila PGRP-SA/GNBP1 and GNBP3, respectively. Moreover, these authors showed that the Drosophila Persephone protease, previously shown to be specific for fungal detection in the Toll pathway (18.Gottar M. Gobert V. Matskevich A.A. Reichhart J.M. Wang C. Butt T.M. Belvin M. Hoffmann J.A. Ferrandon D. Cell. 2006; 127: 1425-1437Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (311) Google Scholar, 28.Ligoxygakis P. Pelte N. Hoffmann J.A. Reichhart J.M. Science. 2002; 297: 114-116Crossref PubMed Scopus (277) Google Scholar), was also required for the sensing of proteases elicited by bacteria in the hemolymph (9.El Chamy L. Leclerc V. Caldelari I. Reichhart J.M. Nat. Immunol. 2008; 9: 1165-1170Crossref PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar). Even though Drosophila Grass and Persephone proteases are known to be serine proteases that transfer fungal recognition signals to pro-Spätzle during β-1,3-glucan-dependent Drosophila Toll pathway activation, the exact biological functions of these serine proteases have not yet been determined biochemically. Therefore, the purification and biochemical characterization of the immediate downstream molecule(s) of GNBP3 or the upstream serine protease(s) of Spätzle that participates in the fungal-dependent Toll signaling pathway are essential for understanding the host defense against fungal infections and the sensing of fungal virulence factors.Here, we have identified the serine protease that lies immediately downstream of Tenebrio GNBP3. By performing in vitro reconstitution experiments, we provide biochemical evidence as to how the Tenebrio GNBP3-mediated β-1,3-glucan recognition signal is transferred to Spätzle. We identified three Tenebrio serine proteases, MSP, SAE, and SPE that function sequentially in a cascade linking β-1,3-glucan recognition by GNBP3 to pro-Spätzle activation. Furthermore, we identified two AMPs that were induced upon injection of β-1,3-glucan, activated SAE, or a processed Spätzle into Tenebrio larvae, demonstrating that they constitute bona fide targets of the Toll pathway.DiscussionIn this study, we report three novel findings regarding the β-1,3-glucan recognition signaling pathway in T. molitor larvae. We show that: 1) Tenebrio MSP functions apically downstream of GNBP3; 2) the β-1,3-glucan recognition signal is transferred via the sequential activation of the three Tenebrio serine proteases, namely MSP, SAE, and SPE, and that this results in the processing of pro-Spätzle to its mature form; and 3) the activation of the GNBP3/MSP/SAE/SPE/Spätzle module cascade regulates the expression of two AMPs, Tenecin 1 and Tenecin 2. Collectively, our results demonstrate that the Tenebrio GNBP3/MSP/SAE/SPE/Spätzle cascade is an essential unit involved in the recognition of fungi and in the activation of Toll-mediated antimicrobial defense (Fig. 5).Our current work, combined with our recent report (26.Kim C.H. Kim S.J. Kan H. Kwon H.M. Roh K.B. Jiang R. Yang Y. Park J.W. Lee H.H. Ha N.C. Kang H.J. Nonaka M. Söderhäll K. Lee B.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2008; 283: 7599-7607Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar), support a model in which Lys-type PG and β-1,3-glucan activate a common set of three serine protease zymogens sequentially (Fig. 5). This three-step proteolytic cascade-dependent processing of the extracellular pro-Spätzle produces active Spätzle, which then binds to the Toll receptor, resulting in the induction of AMP expression in the Tenebrio larval hemocytes (Fig. 5). Each of the three serine proteases has unique biochemical properties to regulate activation of the Tenebrio Toll pathway. The initial enzyme pro-MSP is an 82-kDa serine protease zymogen with an N-terminal chymotrypsin-like cleavage site and a C-terminal chymotrypsin-like catalytic serine protease domain. Pro-SAE is a 41-kDa serine protease with an N-terminal chymotrypsin cleavage site and a C-terminal trypsin-like catalytic serine protease domain, and pro-SPE is a 44-kDa protein with an N-terminal trypsin-like cleavage site and a C-terminal trypsin-like catalytic serine protease domain. These three different serine protease combinations enhance the specificity of the proteolytic serine protease cascade and prevent nonspecific cleavage of these serine protease zymogens.Recent genetic studies using either in vivo RNAi strategy or loss-of-function mutation have demonstrated that several Drosophila serine proteases, such as Persephone, Grass, and Spirit, function upstream of the Drosophila SPE during activation of Toll (22.Kambris Z. Brun S. Jang I.H. Nam H.J. Romeo Y. Takahashi K. Lee W.J. Ueda R. Lemaitre B. Curr. Biol. 2006; 16: 808-813Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (161) Google Scholar). Furthermore, El Chamy et al. (9.El Chamy L. Leclerc V. Caldelari I. Reichhart J.M. Nat. Immunol. 2008; 9: 1165-1170Crossref PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar) demonstrated that Drosophila Grass functions as a signaling component required for both the detection of fungi by GNBP3 and the sensing of Gram-positive bacteria by PGRP-SA. Also, it was suggested that another Drosophila serine protease, Persephone, previously shown to be specific for fungal detection, was required for the sensing of proteases that are released by fungi and bacteria (9.El Chamy L. Leclerc V. Caldelari I. Reichhart J.M. Nat. Immunol. 2008; 9: 1165-1170Crossref PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar). This indicates that Drosophila Persephone defines a parallel proteolytic cascade activated by virulence factors in the hemolymph. However, Drosophila Grass and Persephone genes do not show any homology with Tenebrio MSP, which functions as an apical serine protease common to both Tenebrio GNBP3 and PGRP-SA/GNBP1 complex. These results suggest the existence of significant differences in the proteolytic cascades working upstream of Toll in Tenebrio and Drosophila. In addition to this diversity of serine proteases, the gene expression sites of Tenebrio AMPs are also different from those of Drosophila AMPs. The Tenebrio Tenecin 1 gene was strongly induced in hemocytes of the Tenebrio larvae, while Drosophila AMPs are mainly produced by the fat body. Taken together, the differences in the organization of the serine protease cascade, in the type of AMPs and in the site of AMP synthesis between Drosophila and Tenebrio could represent adaptation mechanisms to fight specific environmental pathogens or may be linked to differences in their physiology. Analyzing differences and similarities in the mechanisms used by insects to fight microbial infection should shed light on the evolution of the immune system in this important phylum.Recently, we provided clear biochemical evidence that the activated Tenebrio SPE converted both the 79-kDa Tenebrio pro-phenoloxidase and clip-domain serine protease homologue 1 zymogen to their matured forms to generate an active melanization complex (27.Kan H.

This complex, consisting of a 76-kDa Tenebrio-activated phenoloxidase and a 43-kDa serine protease homologue 1, efficiently produced melanin on the surface of bacteria, and this activity had a strong bactericidal effect (27.Kan H. Kim C.H. Kwon H.M. Park J.W. Roh K.B. Lee H. Park B.J. Zhang R. Zhang J. Söderhäll K. Ha N.C. Lee B.L. J. Biol.

Because Tenebrio SPE also participates in the activation of the Toll pathway by GNBP3 upon β-1,3-glucan sensing and by PGRP-SA upon Lys-type PG recognition, our results indicate that both the melanization and the Toll pathway immune modules are sharing a common serine protease cascade for the regulation of these two major innate immune responses.In summary, our biochemical studies shed light on the molecular mechanism regulating the Toll pathway by fungi. Our work supports a model in which bacterial Lys-type PG and β-1,3-glucan recognition activate a common proteolytic cascade involving three different serine protease zymogens that are sequentially processed. This three-step proteolytic cascade leads to the maturation of Spätzle and the activation of the Toll intracellular signaling that control the synthesis of AMPs. A greater understanding of these two cascades could also facilitate the development of novel kits to detect bacteria and fungi in clinical and food products rapidly and sensitively. Innate immunity is a crucial host defense mechanism against microbial infection in all animals (1.Hoffmann J.A. Kafatos F.C. Janeway C.A. Ezekowitz R.A.

Both the PGRP-SA/GNBP1 complex and GNBP3 are believed to mediate the activation of a serine protease cascade that ultimately leads to the cleavage of pro-Spätzle into processed Spätzle (5.Lemaitre B.

Cleaved Spätzle serves as a ligand for the cell membrane receptor Toll, and induces the production of AMPs by the fat body (8.Levashina E.A. Langley E. Green C. Gubb D. Ashburner M. Hoffmann J.A.

Serine protease cascades play very important roles in conveying and amplifying signals from pattern recognition receptors in the hemolymph (the insect blood) and lead to activation of the intracellular signaling pathway (23.LeMosy E.K.

BMB Rep. 2008; 41: 102-107Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). They involve the sequential activation of serine proteases and share similarity to the vertebrate complement system (13.Lemaitre B.

The amplification of these recognition signals represents an efficient host defense strategy in insects, which lack an acquired immune system (1.Hoffmann J.A. Kafatos F.C. Janeway C.A. Ezekowitz R.A. Science. 1999; 284: 1313-1318Crossref PubMed Scopus (2137) Google Scholar). Recently, we analyzed the serine protease cascade that regulates the Toll pathway using larvae of the beetle, Tenebrio molitor (26.Kim C.H. Kim S.J. Kan H. Kwon H.M. Roh K.B. Jiang R. Yang Y.

This large insect enabled us to collect large amount of hemolymph, allowing us to purify several different serine proteases. Our study demonstrated that the recognition of Lys-type PG by the PGRP-SA/GNBP1 complex activates Spätzle through the sequential activation of three different Tenebrio serine proteases: modular serine protease (MSP), Spätzle-processing enzyme-activating enzyme (SAE) and SPE (26.Kim C.H. Kim S.J. Kan H. Kwon H.M. Roh K.B. Jiang R. Yang Y. Park J.W. Lee H.H. Ha N.C. Kang H.J. Nonaka M. Söderhäll K. Lee B.L. J. Biol.

A recent study (9.El Chamy L. Leclerc V. Caldelari I. Reichhart J.M. Nat. Immunol. 2008; 9: 1165-1170Crossref PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar) showed that Drosophila Grass functioned as a common serine protease, which transferred signals recognizing both Gram-positive bacteria and fungi via the pattern recognition receptors Drosophila PGRP-SA/GNBP1 and GNBP3, respectively. Moreover, these authors showed that the Drosophila Persephone protease, previously shown to be specific for fungal detection in the Toll pathway (18.Gottar M. Gobert V. Matskevich A.A. Reichhart J.M. Wang C. Butt T.M. Belvin M. Hoffmann J.A. Ferrandon D. Cell. 2006; 127: 1425-1437Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (311) Google Scholar, 28.Ligoxygakis P. Pelte N. Hoffmann J.A. Reichhart J.M. Science. 2002; 297: 114-116Crossref PubMed Scopus (277) Google Scholar), was also required for the sensing of proteases elicited by bacteria in the hemolymph (9.El Chamy L. Leclerc V. Caldelari I. Reichhart J.M. Nat. Immunol. 2008; 9: 1165-1170Crossref PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar). Even though Drosophila Grass and Persephone proteases are known to be serine proteases that transfer fungal recognition signals to pro-Spätzle during β-1,3-glucan-dependent Drosophila Toll pathway activation, the exact biological functions of these serine proteases have not yet been determined biochemically. Therefore, the purification and biochemical characterization of the immediate downstream molecule(s) of GNBP3 or the upstream serine protease(s) of Spätzle that participates in the fungal-dependent Toll signaling pathway are essential for understanding the host defense against fungal infections and the sensing of fungal virulence factors. Here, we have identified the serine protease that lies immediately downstream of Tenebrio GNBP3. By performing in vitro reconstitution experiments, we provide biochemical evidence as to how the Tenebrio GNBP3-mediated β-1,3-glucan recognition signal is transferred to Spätzle. We identified three Tenebrio serine proteases, MSP, SAE, and SPE that function sequentially in a cascade linking β-1,3-glucan recognition by GNBP3 to pro-Spätzle activation. Furthermore, we identified two AMPs that were induced upon injection of β-1,3-glucan, activated SAE, or a processed Spätzle into Tenebrio larvae, demonstrating that they constitute bona fide targets of the Toll pathway. DiscussionIn this study, we report three novel findings regarding the β-1,3-glucan recognition signaling pathway in T. molitor larvae. We show that: 1) Tenebrio MSP functions apically downstream of GNBP3; 2) the β-1,3-glucan recognition signal is transferred via the sequential activation of the three Tenebrio serine proteases, namely MSP, SAE, and SPE, and that this results in the processing of pro-Spätzle to its mature form; and 3) the activation of the GNBP3/MSP/SAE/SPE/Spätzle module cascade regulates the expression of two AMPs, Tenecin 1 and Tenecin 2. Collectively, our results demonstrate that the Tenebrio GNBP3/MSP/SAE/SPE/Spätzle cascade is an essential unit involved in the recognition of fungi and in the activation of Toll-mediated antimicrobial defense (Fig. 5).Our current work, combined with our recent report (26.Kim C.H. Kim S.J. Kan H. Kwon H.M. Roh K.B. Jiang R. Yang Y. Park J.W. Lee H.H. Ha N.C. Kang H.J. Nonaka M. Söderhäll K. Lee B.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2008; 283: 7599-7607Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar), support a model in which Lys-type PG and β-1,3-glucan activate a common set of three serine protease zymogens sequentially (Fig. 5). This three-step proteolytic cascade-dependent processing of the extracellular pro-Spätzle produces active Spätzle, which then binds to the Toll receptor, resulting in the induction of AMP expression in the Tenebrio larval hemocytes (Fig. 5). Each of the three serine proteases has unique biochemical properties to regulate activation of the Tenebrio Toll pathway. The initial enzyme pro-MSP is an 82-kDa serine protease zymogen with an N-terminal chymotrypsin-like cleavage site and a C-terminal chymotrypsin-like catalytic serine protease domain. Pro-SAE is a 41-kDa serine protease with an N-terminal chymotrypsin cleavage site and a C-terminal trypsin-like catalytic serine protease domain, and pro-SPE is a 44-kDa protein with an N-terminal trypsin-like cleavage site and a C-terminal trypsin-like catalytic serine protease domain. These three different serine protease combinations enhance the specificity of the proteolytic serine protease cascade and prevent nonspecific cleavage of these serine protease zymogens.Recent genetic studies using either in vivo RNAi strategy or loss-of-function mutation have demonstrated that several Drosophila serine proteases, such as Persephone, Grass, and Spirit, function upstream of the Drosophila SPE during activation of Toll (22.Kambris Z.

Also, it was suggested that another Drosophila serine protease, Persephone, previously shown to be specific for fungal detection, was required for the sensing of proteases that are released by fungi and bacteria (9.El Chamy L. Leclerc V. Caldelari I. Reichhart J.M. Nat. Immunol. 2008; 9: 1165-1170Crossref PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar). This indicates that Drosophila Persephone defines a parallel proteolytic cascade activated by virulence factors in the hemolymph. However, Drosophila Grass and Persephone genes do not show any homology with Tenebrio MSP, which functions as an apical serine protease common to both Tenebrio GNBP3 and PGRP-SA/GNBP1 complex. These results suggest the existence of significant differences in the proteolytic cascades working upstream of Toll in Tenebrio and Drosophila. In addition to this diversity of serine proteases, the gene expression sites of Tenebrio AMPs are also different from those of Drosophila AMPs. The Tenebrio Tenecin 1 gene was strongly induced in hemocytes of the Tenebrio larvae, while Drosophila AMPs are mainly produced by the fat body.

https://openalex.org/W1993227369,"Inhibitory projection neurons in the deep cerebellar nuclei (DCN) provide GABAergic input to neurons of the inferior olive (IO) that in turn produce climbing fiber synapses onto Purkinje cells. Anatomical evidence suggests that DCN to IO synapses control electrical coupling between IO neurons. In vivo studies suggest that they also control the synchrony of IO neurons and play an important role in cerebellar learning. Here we describe the DCN to IO synapse. Remarkably, GABA release was almost exclusively asynchronous, with little conventional synchronous release. Synaptic transmission was extremely frequency dependent, with low-frequency stimulation being largely ineffective. However, due to the prominence of asynchronous release, stimulation at frequencies above 10 Hz evoked steady-state inhibitory currents. These properties seem ideally suited to transform the firing rate of DCN neurons into sustained inhibition that both suppresses the firing of IO cells and regulates the effective coupling between IO neurons."
https://openalex.org/W2035598429,"Adaptation is conventionally regarded as occurring at the level of the individual organism, where it functions to maximize the individual's inclusive fitness. However, it has recently been argued that empirical studies on the evolution of parasite virulence in spatial populations show otherwise. In particular, it has been claimed that the evolution of lower virulence in response to limited parasite dispersal provides proof of Wynne-Edwards's idea of adaptation at the group level. Although previous theoretical work has shown that limited dispersal can favour lower virulence, it has not clarified why, with five different suggestions having been given. Here we show that the effect of dispersal on parasite virulence can be understood entirely within the framework of inclusive fitness theory. Limited parasite dispersal favours lower parasite growth rates and, hence, reduced virulence because it (1) decreases the direct benefit of producing offspring (dispersers are worth more than non-dispersers, because they can go to patches with no or fewer parasites), and (2) increases the competition for hosts experienced by both the focal individual ('self-shading') and their relatives ('kin shading'). This demonstrates that reduced virulence can be understood as an individual-level adaptation by the parasite to maximize its inclusive fitness, and clarifies the links with virulence theory more generally."
https://openalex.org/W2009024574,"Recent studies have demonstrated that kynurenic acid (KYNA), a compound produced endogenously by the interferon-γ-induced degradation of tryptophan by indoleamine 2,3-dioxygenase, activates the previously orphaned G protein-coupled receptor, GPR35. This receptor is expressed in immune tissues, although its potential function in immunomodulation remains to be explored. We determined that GPR35 was most highly expressed on human peripheral monocytes. In an in vitro vascular flow model, KYNA triggered the firm arrest of monocytes to both fibronectin and ICAM-1, via β1 integrin- and β2 integrin-mediated mechanisms, respectively. Incubation of monocytes with pertussis toxin prior to use in flow experiments significantly reduced the KYNA-induced monocyte adhesion, suggesting that adhesion is triggered by a Gi-mediated process. Furthermore, KYNA-triggered adhesion of monocytic cells was reduced by short hairpin RNA-mediated silencing of GPR35. Although GPR35 is expressed at slightly lower levels on neutrophils, KYNA induced firm adhesion of these cells to an ICAM-1-expressing monolayer as well. KYNA also elicited neutrophil shedding of surface L-selectin, another indicator of leukocyte activation. Taken together, these data suggest that KYNA could be an important early mediator of leukocyte recruitment.

Leukocyte recruitment into tissue compartments is a tightly regulated process orchestrated by chemokines (1.Springer T.A. Cell. 1994; 76: 301-314Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (6414) Google Scholar). Chemokines convert leukocyte rolling or tethering on the vascular endothelium to firm arrest via the activation of leukocyte surface integrins (2.Campbell J.J. Hedrick J. Zlotnik A.

As chemoattractants, chemokines subsequently play an important role in the directional migration of leukocytes through tissues. Chemoattractant receptors are a subtype of G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs), 3The abbreviations used are: GPCRG protein-coupled receptorIL-8interleukin-8MCP-1monocyte chemoattractant protein-1fMLPformyl-methionyl-leucyl-phenylalanineKYNAkynurenic acidIDOindoleamine 2,3-dioxygenaseAAanthranilic acidPTXpertussis toxinHUVEChuman umbilical vein endothelial cellICAM-1intercellular adhesion molecule-1QPCRquantitative polymerase chain reactionshRNAshort hairpin RNA. one of the largest known families of human proteins. Chemoattractant receptors bind a variety of agonists, including proteins such as interleukin-8 (IL-8, CXCL8) (4.Holmes W.E. Lee J. Kuang W.J. Rice G.C. Wood W.I. Science. 1991; 253: 1278-1280Crossref PubMed Scopus (917) Google Scholar) and monocyte chemoattractant protein-1 (MCP-1, CCL2) (5.Charo I.F. Myers S.J. Herman A. Franci C. Connolly A.J. Coughlin S.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 1994; 91: 2752-2756Crossref PubMed Scopus (654) Google Scholar), small peptides such as fMLP (6.Koo C. Lefkowitz R.J. Snyderman R. J. Clin.

Nature. 1997; 387: 620-624Crossref PubMed Scopus (856) Google Scholar). As such, chemoattractant receptors mirror the entire family of GPCRs, which can be activated by ligands ranging in size from metabolites to large proteins (8.Lagerström M.C. Schiöth H.B. Nat. Rev. Drug Discov. 2008; 7: 339-357Crossref PubMed Scopus (1138) Google Scholar).

Because GPCRs serve as targets for therapeutic intervention, considerable activity has gone into the identification of both putative GPCR genes and the ligands for the resulting receptors (8.Lagerström M.C. Schiöth H.B. Nat. Rev. Drug Discov. 2008; 7: 339-357Crossref PubMed Scopus (1138) Google Scholar). Recently, the tryptophan metabolite kynurenic acid (KYNA) was identified as an agonist for the previously “orphaned” receptor GPR35. KYNA was shown to elicit intracellular release of Ca2+ in Chinese hamster ovary cells in which GPR35 was co-expressed in the context of a chimeric G protein signaling apparatus. HEK93 cells transfected with GPR35 and Gqo proteins accumulated inositol phosphate upon exposure to KYNA. KYNA also induced internalization of GPR35 on HeLa cells, which is commonly seen following the activation of GPRs with agonists such as chemokines (9.Wang J. Simonavicius N. Wu X. Swaminath G. Reagan J. Tian H. Ling L. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 22021-22028Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (479) Google Scholar). KYNA is produced endogenously as a result of the degradation of tryptophan (Fig. 1). In most tissues, the rate-limiting step in this degradation is the conversion of tryptophan to N-formylkynurenine, a reaction that can be catalyzed by the inducible enzyme indolemine 2,3-dioxygenase (IDO). IDO is induced by interferon-γ, which leads to a substantial increase in the concentration of KYNA and other tryptophan catabolites during inflammatory processes. Previous work has demonstrated that KYNA acts as a neuroprotective agent by antagonizing both N-methyl-d-aspartate and α7-nicotinic receptors (10.Stone T.W. Pharmacol. Rev. 1993; 45: 309-379PubMed Google Scholar, 11.Parsons C.G. Danysz W. Quack G. Hartmann S. Lorenz B. Wollenburg C. Baran L. Przegalinski E. Kostowski W. Krzascik P. Chizh B. Headley P.M. J.

Neurosci. 2001; 21: 7463-7473Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Many peripheral tissues, including the heart and vasculature, are also capable of generating KYNA (13.Baran H. Amann G. Lubec B. Lubec G. Pediatr. Res. 1997; 41: 404-410Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar, 14.Stazka J. Luchowski P. Wielosz M. Kleinrok Z. Urbańska E.M. Eur. J. Pharmacol. 2002; 448: 133-137Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar), although its role in these tissues has not been well defined. Expression analysis indicates that GPR35 is selectively present in immune and intestinal tissues. From a functional perspective, KYNA treatment inhibited the secretion of tumor necrosis factor-α by mononuclear cells treated with lipopolysaccharide (9.Wang J. Simonavicius N. Wu X. Swaminath G. Reagan J. Tian H. Ling L. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 22021-22028Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (479) Google Scholar). This finding is in general agreement with the prevailing literature suggesting that IDO-mediated tryptophan catabolism appears to play a significant counter-regulatory role in dampening down the activation of the immune system (15.Mellor A.L. Munn D.H. Nat. Rev. Immunol. 2004; 4: 762-774Crossref PubMed Scopus (1875) Google Scholar). However, the potential spectrum of physiological roles for KYNA in immune modulation remains incompletely characterized. Given the reported high level of GPR35 expression on circulating leukocytes, here we tested the hypothesis that KYNA may play a chemokine-like role in modulating leukocyte-endothelial interactions under physiologically relevant flow conditions as seen in the vasculature. We explored the intracellular signaling pathways by which KYNA may be activating leukocytes, as well as the surface integrins modulating these effects. We report the unanticipated finding that KYNA is sufficient to drive early leukocyte adhesion. RPMI 1640 and Dulbecco's phosphate-buffered saline with or without Ca2+ and Mg2+ were obtained from Invitrogen. KYNA, tryptophan, anthranilic acid (AA), and pertussis toxin (PTX) were obtained from Sigma. Human chemokines MCP-1 and IL-8 were obtained from Peprotech (Rocky Hill, NJ). Human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs), endothelial growth medium-2, and endothelial basal medium-2 were obtained from Lonza (Basel, Switzerland); HUVECs were cultured according to the supplier's directions. To prepare slides for flow adhesion studies, 0.8-cm2 chambers were attached to Permanox slides (Nunc, Rochester, NY) using 2% agarose in phosphate-buffered saline. The interior surface of the resulting well was coated with 0.05% fibronectin (Sigma) in phosphate-buffered saline (with Ca2+ and Mg2+) for 1 h at 37 °C. For monolayers, ∼20,000 freshly trypsinized HUVECs (passages 2–4) were seeded in the fibronectin-coated wells and grown at 37 °C for 18 h prior to transfection with adenoviral ICAM-1 vector as previously described (16.Gerszten R.E.

Chem. 2001; 276: 26846-26851Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar) using endothelial basal medium-2 as a transfection medium and endothelial growth medium-2 for growth conditions. HUVEC monolayers were used in flow experiments 48 h after transfection. HP2/1, a monoclonal antibody to α4 integrin (CD49d) was obtained from Immunotech (Marseille, France). TS1/18, a monoclonal antibody to human β2 integrin (CD18) was obtained from Endogen (Rockford, IL). Mouse IgG1 isotype control antibody was obtained from Pharmingen. LM609, a blocking antibody to αvβ3 integrin was obtained from Millipore (Billerica, MA). Leukocytes were freshly prepared from healthy human donors. Mononuclear cells were isolated via Ficoll-Hypaque (LSM, Fisher Scientific, Fair Lawn, NJ) density gradient centrifugation and washed in RPMI 1640. CD14+ monocytes were further purified from this subset of cells by depletion of other mononuclear cell types with magnetic-activated cell separation (Monocyte Isolation Kit II, Miltenyi Biotec, Auburn, CA). Neutrophils were isolated by Ficoll-Hypaque gradient, followed by dextran sedimentation and hypotonic lysis of contaminating red blood cells (17.Clark R.A. Nauseef W.M. Coligan J.E. Kruisbeek A.M. Margulies D.H. Shevach E.M. Strober W. Current Protocols in Immunology. John Wiley and Sons, Inc., New York1996: 7.23.2-7.23.4Google Scholar). Quantitative PCR (QPCR) analysis of transcript levels of GPR35 and other chemokine receptors was performed on freshly isolated leukocytes. Total cellular RNA was isolated using RNeasy columns (Qiagen, Valencia, CA), treated with DNase I (Invitrogen), and reverse transcribed to cDNA using TaqMan reagents (Applied Biosystems, Foster, CA). QPCR was performed on an Mx4000 quantitative PCR instrument (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA) using Power SYBR Green PCR reagents (Applied Biosystems). Primers for GPR35 were as previously described (9.Wang J. Simonavicius N. Wu X. Swaminath G. Reagan J. Tian H. Ling L. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 22021-22028Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (479) Google Scholar); primers for chemokine receptors were the generous gift of Dr. Terry Means, and were designed as previously described (18.Means T.K. Hayashi F. Smith K.D. Aderem A. Luster A.D. J. Immunol. 2003; 170: 5165-5175Crossref PubMed Scopus (335) Google Scholar). To measure shedding of L-selectin, 3 × 106 neutrophils in a total volume of 200 μl in RPMI 1640 were incubated with test compounds for 30 min at room temperature. Cleaved L-selectin in the supernatant was measured using the Human sL-Selectin ELISA kit (BIOSOURCE, Nivelles, Belgium). Flow adhesion studies were carried out in a parallel plate laminar flow chamber (Immunetics, Cambridge, MA), using either phosphate-buffered saline with Ca2+ and Mg2+ (for fibronectin-coated slides) or RPMI + 1% autologous serum (for ICAM-1-transfected monolayers) as perfusion medium. Estimated shear stress ranged from 1 dyne/cm2 (0.2 ml/min) for fibronectin-coated surfaces to 1.75 dyne/cm2 (0.35 ml/min) for the ICAM-1-expressing monolayers. Compounds to be tested were added to the leukocyte reservoir, and the adherent cells on the test surface were counted at the indicated time in at least three fields. For inhibitor studies, leukocytes were incubated with the appropriate antibody for 10 min on ice, or with PTX for 60 min at 37 °C, prior to introduction into the flow chamber. Plasmids encoding lentiviruses expressing shRNAs were obtained from the library of The RNAi Consortium (TRC) at the Broad Institute (19.Moffat J. Grueneberg D.A. Yang X. Kim S.Y. Kloepfer A.M.

Plasmids were purified using the QiaPrep miniprep kit (Qiagen), then transfected into HEK 293T cells with a three-plasmid system to produce lentivirus (19.Moffat J. Grueneberg D.A. Yang X. Kim S.Y.

THP-1 cells at 2 × 105 cells/ml were infected with the virus in media containing 7.5 μg/ml Polybrene, and centrifuged for 30 min at 37 °C and 2000 × g. Three days post-infection, infected cells were selected by adjusting the media to 3 μg/ml puromycin. Degree of knockdown was determined by QPCR analysis as described above; the cell strain with the highest degree of GPR35 knockdown (Table S1) was selected for further study of adhesion under flow conditions. All data are presented as mean ± S.E. For significance, an unpaired two-tailed Student's t test was performed. The null hypothesis was rejected at p < 0.05. To assess the potential role of KYNA in leukocyte adhesion processes, we first measured the level of GPR35 mRNA in several leukocyte cell types, as well as in endothelial cells. GPR35 was most highly expressed in monocytes, with significant expression in neutrophils as well. By contrast, QPCR experiments suggested virtually no expression in endothelial cells (Fig. 2A). The level of GPR35 expression on monocytes was less than that of the prototypical monocyte chemokine receptor, CCR2, although comparable with that of CXCR2 (Fig. 2B). Activation of both of these receptors results in robust monocyte adhesion (3.Gerszten R.E. Garcia-Zepeda E.A. Lim Y.C. Yoshida M. Ding H.A. Gimbrone Jr., M.A. Luster A.D. Luscinskas F.W. Rosenzweig A. Nature. 1999; 398: 718-723Crossref PubMed Scopus (1070) Google Scholar) and also contributes to monocyte trafficking in atherosclerosis in vivo (21.Papadopoulou C. Corrigall V. Taylor P.R. Poston R.N. Cytokine. 2008; 43: 181-186Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar, 22.Boring L. Gosling J. Cleary M. Charo I.F. Nature. 1998; 394: 894-897Crossref PubMed Scopus (1686) Google Scholar). GPR35 expression greatly exceeded that of CCR3, a chemokine receptor that is highly expressed on basophils and eosinophils but present only at very low levels on monocytes (23.Ponath P.D. Qin S. Post T.W. Wang J. Wu L. Gerard N.P. Newman W. Gerard C. Mackay C.R. J. Exp. Med. 1996; 183: 2437-2448Crossref PubMed Scopus (553) Google Scholar). To test whether KYNA was sufficient to induce β1 integrin-mediated firm arrest under physiological flow conditions, we employed a flow chamber to pass monocytes over a fibronectin-coated surface. At a shear stress of 1.0 dyne/cm2, KYNA treatment resulted in a 13-fold increase in the number of adherent cells as compared with baseline, slightly higher than adhesion induced by the CCR2 agonist MCP-1. Tryptophan and AA, two metabolites closely related to KYNA that do not bind GPR35 (9.Wang J. Simonavicius N. Wu X. Swaminath G. Reagan J. Tian H. Ling L. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 22021-22028Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (479) Google Scholar), had no effect on the adhesion of monocytes (Fig. 3A). Pretreatment of the monocytes with HP2/1, an α4 integrin-blocking antibody that interferes with α4β1-mediated arrest, significantly reduced the number of adherent cells induced by KYNA exposure. By contrast, pretreatment with an isotype-matched control antibody did not result in any reduction in KYNA-induced firm arrest (Fig. 3B). Many chemokine-triggered effector functions in leukocytes are dependent on the G protein αi subunit of the G protein heterotrimer (24.Kuang Y. Wu Y. Jiang H. Wu D. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 3975-3978Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (174) Google Scholar). To assess whether the effects of KYNA on monocyte adhesion involved this pathway, we pretreated cells with PTX prior to introducing them into the flow chamber. PTX exerts its effects by ADP-ribosylating the α subunit of the G protein heterotrimer, thus preventing the complex from coupling with receptors on the surface of the cell (25.Burns D.L. Microbiol. Sci. 1988; 5: 285-287PubMed Google Scholar). Incubation of monocytes with PTX prior to use in flow experiments significantly reduced the KYNA-induced adhesion of monocytes to fibronectin (Fig. 3B), confirming that this adhesion is triggered by a Gi-mediated process. Interactions between activated β2 integrins and intercellular adhesion molecule (ICAM)-1 are also sufficient to confer monocyte arrest under flow conditions (3.Gerszten R.E. Garcia-Zepeda E.A. Lim Y.C. Yoshida M. Ding H.A. Gimbrone Jr., M.A. Luster A.D. Luscinskas F.W. Rosenzweig A. Nature. 1999; 398: 718-723Crossref PubMed Scopus (1070) Google Scholar). We therefore examined the adhesion of monocytes to endothelial monolayers expressing ICAM-1 using an adenoviral expression system. We have previously demonstrated that this system is extremely sensitive to adhesive triggers (3.Gerszten R.E. Garcia-Zepeda E.A. Lim Y.C. Yoshida M. Ding H.A. Gimbrone Jr., M.A. Luster A.D. Luscinskas F.W. Rosenzweig A. Nature. 1999; 398: 718-723Crossref PubMed Scopus (1070) Google Scholar). KYNA treatment of monocytes in this system increased adhesion in a dose-dependent fashion, with significant arrest observed as low as 300 nm, while treatment with 1 μm anthranilic acid elicited no effect (Fig. 4A). This is significantly lower than the concentration necessary to induce adhesion to fibronectin surfaces, consistent with previous reports that firm arrest of leukocytes on adhesion molecule-expressing endothelial monolayers (as opposed to purified protein immobilized on coverslip) is highly sensitive to chemoattractant agonists (3.Gerszten R.E. Garcia-Zepeda E.A. Lim Y.C. Yoshida M. Ding H.A. Gimbrone Jr., M.A. Luster A.D. Luscinskas F.W. Rosenzweig A. Nature. 1999; 398: 718-723Crossref PubMed Scopus (1070) Google Scholar). To verify the specificity of the observed interactions, we pretreated the leukocytes with the β2 integrin-blocking antibody, TS1/18. Pretreatment with this antibody, but not an αvβ3-blocking antibody, LM609, abolished the KYNA-induced response (Fig. 4B). As with adhesion to fibronectin, pretreatment of monocytes with PTX significantly reduced adhesion to ICAM-1-expressing monolayers, confirming Gi involvement (Fig. 4B). Although KYNA-triggered response of monocytes on fibronectin was greater than the MCP-1-triggered response, the reverse was observed with the ICAM-1 monolayers. As KYNA and MCP-1 would both be expected to be present under certain inflammatory circumstances (and potentially other chemokines as well), we tested how the addition of both agonists modulated adhesion. Simultaneous treatment with both MCP-1 and KYNA resulted in an additive, but not synergistic effect on firm arrest (data not shown). To confirm that the observed adhesion was indeed due to activation of GPR35 by KYNA, we used shRNA to generate THP-1 cells with reduced expression of GPR35. GPR35-silenced cells showed a marked reduction in GPR35 mRNA expression relative to control cells infected with an anti-green fluorescent protein lentivirus (Fig. 5A). Green fluorescent protein-silenced control THP-1 cells retained a level of KYNA-triggered firm arrest relative to baseline that is similar to that observed in freshly isolated human leukocytes. By contrast, cells with reduced GPR35 expression did not show a significant increase in firm arrest after KYNA treatment (Fig. 5B). Because GPR35 was also readily detected in human neutrophils, we tested whether KYNA was sufficient to trigger adhesion of this leukocyte subset as well. Because neutrophil adhesion under flow is predominantly dependent on β2 integrin-ICAM-1 interactions, we also flowed neutrophils over ICAM-1-expressing HUVECs. At a shear stress of 1.75 dyne/cm2, 300 nm KYNA was sufficient to trigger statistically significant increases in neutrophil adhesion (Fig. 6A), whereas treatment with 1 μm AA did not increase adhesion above background levels. In this system as well, pretreatment of the neutrophils with the β2 integrin-blocking antibody TS1/18 abrogated the effects of KYNA on leukocyte arrest. To verify that KYNA-induced arrest is a result of leukocyte, and not endothelial activation, we treated the HUVEC monolayers for 15 min with KYNA in perfusion buffer and then washed the monolayers prior to placement in the flow chamber. As treatment of the monolayers resulted in no increase of neutrophil adhesion over background (Fig. 6C), KYNA appeared to be exerting its effects on the neutrophils. We also examined the cleavage of L-selectin from the surface of neutrophils as an indicator of the degree of cellular activation (26.Kishimoto T.K. Jutila M.A. Berg E.L. Butcher E.C. Science. 1989; 245: 1238-1241Crossref PubMed Scopus (922) Google Scholar). After a 30-min incubation with 100 nm of the known activating agent IL-8, a significant increase in cleaved L-selectin over baseline was observed (Fig. 7), consistent with previous results (27.Smith C.W. Kishimoto T.K. Abbassi O. Hughes B. Rothlein R. McIntire L.V. Butcher E. Anderson D.C. Abbassi O. J. Clin. Invest. 1991; 87: 609-618Crossref PubMed Scopus (348) Google Scholar). Treatment with KYNA resulted in shedding of L-selectin from neutrophils in a dose-dependent fashion, showing a greater than 2-fold increase in shed L-selectin over baseline at a concentration of 10 mm, and a significant increase in the cleaved molecule even at the lowest KYNA dose tested (100 μm) (Fig. 7). Additionally, we tested two other metabolites from the tryptophan metabolic pathway that are known not to activate GPR35 (9.Wang J. Simonavicius N. Wu X. Swaminath G. Reagan J. Tian H. Ling L. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 22021-22028Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (479) Google Scholar): tryptophan and anthranilic acid. At a concentration of 1 mm, neither compound elicited an increase in L-selectin shedding above the background level (Fig. 7). We found that KYNA is capable of activating multiple subsets of leukocytes, eliciting firm arrest in these cells through both β1 and β2 integrin-mediated adhesion. This adhesion was PTX-sensitive, which suggests that it occurs through a Gi-coupled pathway. By contrast, two related compounds that are known not to bind GPR35, tryptophan and anthranilic acid (9.Wang J. Simonavicius N. Wu X. Swaminath G. Reagan J. Tian H. Ling L. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 22021-22028Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (479) Google Scholar), did not evoke activation or adhesion of leukocytes, consistent with a GPR35-mediated mechanism. Silencing of GPR35 expression using shRNA significantly reduced KYNA-induced firm arrest of a monocytic cell line to ICAM-1-expressing surfaces, confirming GPR35 involvement in this process. The ability of KYNA to trigger adhesion is consistent with other studies demonstrating unanticipated roles for small molecules in immune modulation. Medium chain fatty acids, particularly capric acid, undecanoic acid, and lauric acid, are able to activate GPR84, a receptor that is significantly up-regulated in lipopolysaccharide-stimulated monocytes. Treatment with these compounds amplifies the effect of lipopolysaccharide treatment on secretion of the cytokine IL-12p40 by RAW264.7 cells (28.Wang J. Wu X. Simonavicius N. Tian H. Ling L. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 34457-34464Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (295) Google Scholar). The baseline concentration of KYNA in human plasma is ∼25 nm (29.Forrest C.M. Mackay G.M. Oxford L.

During inflammation, however, interferon-γ induction of IDO leads to the degradation of tryptophan and subsequent generation of catabolites including KYNA. As such, the concentration of KYNA could be expected to reach the micromolar range (32.Heyes M.P. Saito K. Crowley J.S. Davis L.E. Demitrack M.A. Der M. Dilling L.A. Elia J. Kruesi M.J. Lackner A.

Vascular endothelial cells have been demonstrated to convert kynurenine to KYNA, so localized regions with sufficient KYNA concentration to elicit a leukocyte response may be present in the vasculature. Our studies indicate that KYNA can evoke firm adhesion at concentrations as low as 300 nm. This is significantly less than the EC50 of 39.2 μm previously reported for KYNA activation of human GPR35 overexpressed on Chinese hamster ovary cells (9.Wang J. Simonavicius N. Wu X. Swaminath G. Reagan J. Tian H. Ling L. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 22021-22028Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (479) Google Scholar). However, we would expect that the receptor expressed in its endogenous context would behave differently than when overexpressed in a transformed cell line. The coupling of GPRs to chimeric G proteins for Ca2+ mobilization assays may significantly increase the measured EC50 for some ligands, relative to assays utilizing native couplings (35.Liu C. Wilson S.J. Kuei C. Lovenberg T.W. J. Pharmacol. Exp. Ther. 2001; 299: 121-130PubMed Google Scholar, 36.Chen J. Liu C. Lovenberg T.W. Eur. J. Pharmacol. 2003; 467: 57-65Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar); differences up to 50-fold have been reported (37.Liu C. Chen J. Sutton S. Roland B. Kuei C. Farmer N. Sillard R. Lovenberg T.W. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 50765-50770Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (209) Google Scholar). Additionally, the arrest of leukocytes on ICAM-1-expressing endothelial cells is a highly sensitive assay (3.Gerszten R.E. Garcia-Zepeda E.A. Lim Y.C. Yoshida M. Ding H.A. Gimbrone Jr., M.A. Luster A.D. Luscinskas F.W. Rosenzweig A. Nature. 1999; 398: 718-723Crossref PubMed Scopus (1070) Google Scholar), and significant adhesion may be seen with ligands at less than half-maximal activation concentration. Reports have indicated that KYNA can reduce the lipopolysaccharide-stimulated secretion of the pro-inflammatory cytokines tumor necrosis factor-α and interferon-γ over long (18–72 h) time periods (9.Wang J. Simonavicius N. Wu X. Swaminath G. Reagan J. Tian H. Ling L. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 22021-22028Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (479) Google Scholar, 38.Maes M. Mihaylova I. Ruyter M.D. Kubera M. Bosmans E. Neuroendocrinol. Lett. 2007; 28: 826-831PubMed Google Scholar). This would suggest a down-modulation of the immune response; however, other types of acute assays were not performed. Although immunosuppression is consistent with evidence that tryptophan metabolites generated after the induction of IDO act in an anti-inflammatory capacity (15.Mellor A.L. Munn D.H. Nat. Rev. Immunol. 2004; 4: 762-774Crossref PubMed Scopus (1875) Google Scholar), the data presented here suggest that the situation may in fact be more complex. Given the ability of KYNA to elicit early stage arrest of leukocytes, tryptophan catabolism by IDO may have a rapid pro-inflammatory phase, followed by a later anti-inflammatory period. Further investigation into the kinetic response of leukocytes to KYNA will be necessary to better understand both the pro- and anti-inflammatory actions of KYNA on specific leukocyte subsets. shRNA-mediated decrease in GPR35 expression was accompanied by a concordant reduction in KYNA-triggered adhesion of monocytic cells. We were also interested to find that GPR35-deficient cells grew in clusters, although the cells could be easily dissociated by gentle pipetting for functional assays. The spectrum of chronic effects of GPR35 deletion in vitro and in vivo thus remains the subject of future investigation. Also worth considering is the potential effect of KYNA on individuals with renal insufficiency. Because the primary method of excretion of tryptophan catabolites is through the kidneys, renal insufficient patients have chronically elevated levels of KYNA. A recent study has shown that uremic patients exhibit pre-dialysis serum levels of KYNA greater than 300 nm; this elevation is only partially reduced by hemodialysis, with KYNA remaining at ∼10 times the baseline level (39.Pawlak D. Pawlak K. Malyszko J. Mysliwiec M. Buczko W. Int. Urol. Nephrol. 2001; 33: 399-404Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). As patients with renal insufficiency suffer from an increased rate of cardiovascular disease, further investigation into the consequences of chronically elevated KYNA in these patients may be merited. In summary, our studies have shown that KYNA is capable of eliciting firm arrest of both neutrophils and monocytes under physiological flow conditions in an in vitro model. Clearly, multiple factors contribute to the adhesion process in vivo that are not present in this system, and additional studies in animal models are warranted.

Previously, we and others have shown that Leptospira immunoglobulin-like proteins (Lig) of Leptospira spp. bind to fibronectin, laminin, collagen, and fibrinogen. In this study, we report that Leptospira can be immobilized by human tropoelastin (HTE) or elastin from different tissues, including lung, skin, and blood vessels, and that Lig proteins can bind to HTE or elastin. Moreover, both elastin and HTE bind to the same LigB immunoglobulin-like domains, including LigBCon4, LigBCen7'-8, LigBCen9, and LigBCen12 as demonstrated by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) and competition ELISAs. The LigB immunoglobulin-like domain binds to the 17th to 27th exons of HTE (17-27HTE) as determined by ELISA (LigBCon4, K(D) = 0.50 microm; LigBCen7'-8, K(D) = 0.82 microm; LigBCen9, K(D) = 1.54 microm; and LigBCen12, K(D) = 0.73 microm). The interaction of LigBCon4 and 17-27HTE was further confirmed by steady state fluorescence spectroscopy (K(D) = 0.49 microm) and ITC (K(D) = 0.54 microm). Furthermore, the binding was enthalpy-driven and affected by environmental pH, indicating it is a charge-charge interaction. The binding affinity of LigBCon4D341N to 17-27HTE was 4.6-fold less than that of wild type LigBCon4. In summary, we show that Lig proteins of Leptospira spp. interact with elastin and HTE, and we conclude this interaction may contribute to Leptospira adhesion to host tissues during infection."

Here, we report that Notch activation modulates TGFβ signaling pathways in a receptor-activated Smad (R-Smad)-specific manner.

TGFβ is a multifunctional growth factor that is involved in many biological processes, including proliferation, differentiation, and apoptosis (8.Massagué J. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2000; 1: 169-178Crossref PubMed Scopus (1653) Google Scholar, 9.Attisano L. Wrana J.L. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 2000; 12: 235-243Crossref PubMed Scopus (479) Google Scholar). The TGFβ signal is transmitted through specific transmembrane type I and type II serine/threonine kinase receptors. Upon TGFβ binding, the constitutively active TGFβ type II receptor recruits and phosphorylates TGFβ type I receptor, and the latter phosphorylates receptor-activated Smads (R-Smads), including Smad1, Smad2, Smad3, Smad5, and Smad8. The phosphorylated R-Smads then form a complex with a common Smad, Smad4, and translocate into the nucleus to regulate target gene expression through interaction with other cofactors (10.Massagué J. Seoane J. Wotton D. Genes Dev. 2005; 19: 2783-2810Crossref PubMed Scopus (1927) Google Scholar). In endothelial cells, TGFβ binds two distinct type I receptors, ALK1 (activin receptor-like kinase 1) and ALK5, to activate ALK1/Smad1/5/8 and ALK5/Smad2/3 signaling pathways. These two pathways regulate different genes and exert opposing biological functions in endothelial cells (11.Goumans M.J. Lebrin F. Valdimarsdottir G. Trends Cardiovasc. Med. 2003; 13: 301-307Crossref PubMed Scopus (281) Google Scholar, 12.Goumans M.J. Valdimarsdottir G. Itoh S. Rosendahl A. Sideras P. ten Dijke P. EMBO J. 2002; 21: 1743-1753Crossref PubMed Scopus (932) Google Scholar). The evolutionarily conserved Notch signaling pathway determines cell fate by regulating multiple cellular processes, including proliferation, differentiation, and apoptosis (13.Artavanis-Tsakonas S.

In mammals, four Notch receptors (Notch1–Notch4) and five ligands (Dll1 (Delta-like 1), Dll3, Dll4, Jagged1, and Jagged2) have been identified. Notch signaling is initiated by ligand binding, which triggers proteolytic cleavage of the transmembrane receptor and release of the Notch intracellular domain (NICD). Translocation of NICD into the nucleus results in association with the DNA-binding protein CSL and recruitment of coactivators, such as MAML (Mastermind-like) to initiate transcription (15.Wu L. Sun T. Kobayashi K. Gao P. Griffin J.D. Mol. Cell Biol. 2002; 22: 7688-7700Crossref PubMed Scopus (209) Google Scholar, 16.Nam Y. Weng A.P. Aster J.C. Blacklow S.C. J. Biol.

Cross-talk between the Notch and TGFβ pathways has not been studied in endothelial cells, where both the Smad1/5/8 and Smad2/3 pathways can be activated in the same cell via ALK1 and ALK5 receptors, respectively (11.Goumans M.J. Lebrin F. Valdimarsdottir G. Trends Cardiovasc. Med. 2003; 13: 301-307Crossref PubMed Scopus (281) Google Scholar, 12.Goumans M.J. Valdimarsdottir G. Itoh S. Rosendahl A. Sideras P. ten Dijke P.

Both synergy and antagonism between Notch and TGFβ signaling have been reported in other cell types, and the interaction between Notch and TGFβ signaling appears to be cell type- and context-dependent (18.Blokzijl A.

Chem. 2008; 283: 1324-1333Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). Further, in previous studies, Notch signaling was activated by overexpression of the constitutively active NICD. In the current studies, we have attempted to understand the functional consequences of coordinate TGFβ and Notch activation at physiologic levels in the endothelium. Dll4 (Delta-like 4) is the major Notch ligand expressed in endothelial cells (25.Mailhos C. Modlich U. Lewis J. Harris A. Bicknell R. Ish-Horowicz D. Differentiation. 2001; 69: 135-144Crossref PubMed Scopus (261) Google Scholar), and Dll4 activation of Notch plays an important role in cardiovascular development (26.Krebs L.T. Shutter J.R. Tanigaki K. Honjo T. Stark K.L. Gridley T. Genes Dev. 2004; 18: 2469-2473Crossref PubMed Scopus (438) Google Scholar). Here, we report for the first time that in endothelial cells, Notch activation by either NICD expression or co-culture of Dll4-expressing cells regulates TGFβ ALK1/Smad1, ALK5/Smad2, and ALK5/Smad3 signaling pathways by differentially affecting the expression of these R-Smads. Notch activation decreases the expression of Smad1 and Smad2 and their target genes, whereas Notch increases expression of Smad3 and regulates target genes in a gene-specific manner. Notch not only increases SMAD3 mRNA levels but also prolongs Smad3 protein half-life. In vivo endothelium-specific inhibition of Notch signaling by the expression of dominant negative MAML1 reduces Smad3 expression in the cardiac cushion of mouse embryonic hearts. Importantly, we demonstrate that simultaneous activation of TGFβ and Notch signaling recruits Smad3 to both Smad binding elements (SBEs) and CSL binding sites and cooperatively increases histone H4 acetylation at promoters in which consensus cis elements of both pathways are present. Our findings provide a molecular mechanism for the synergistic induction of a subset of TGFβ and Notch target genes, and demonstrate the crucial role of this interaction in vivo. Rabbit anti-Smad1 and Smad2 antibodies were acquired from Zymed Laboratories Inc. (San Francisco, CA). Rabbit anti-Smad3, anti-Snail, and anti-histone H3 (trimethyl K4) antibodies were obtained from Abcam (Cambridge, MA).

Rabbit anti-acetyl-histone H4 antibody was obtained from Upstate Biotechnology, Inc. (Lake Placid, NY). The human microvascular endothelial cell line HMEC-1 (human microvascular endothelial cells (HMEC); Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (Atlanta, GA)), the retroviral packaging cell line, PhoenixTM-Ampho, and 293T cells were cultured as described previously (5.Niessen K. Fu Y. Chang L. Hoodless P.A. McFadden D. Karsan A. J. Cell Biol. 2008; 182: 315-325Crossref PubMed Scopus (265) Google Scholar). pLNCX-N4IC-HA, MIY-Dll4-HA, MSCV-Smad3, and MSCV-FLAG-Smad3 were used for retroviral infection of HMEC or transient transfection of 293T cells. TransIT-LT1 Transfection Reagent (Mirus, Madison, WI) or calcium phosphate was used for transfection of PhoenixTM-Ampho and 293T cells. For TGFβ treatment, HMEC were cultured in MCDB medium containing 0.2% serum overnight and then left untreated or treated with 2.5 ng/ml of recombinant human TGFβ1 (R&D systems, Inc., Minneapolis, MN) for various times. Whole cell lysates were prepared using modified radioimmune precipitation buffer as described previously (27.Fu Y. Sies H. Lei X.G. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 43004-43009Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). For cytosolic and nuclear fraction preparations, cells were lysed using Buffer A (10 mm HEPES-KOH, pH 7.8, 1.5 mm MgCl2, 10 mm KCl) containing 0.5% Nonidet P-40 and a protease inhibitor mixture (PIC; Roche Applied Science), incubated on ice for 10 min, and centrifuged at 12,000 × g for 15 min. The supernatant was collected as the cytosolic fraction. The pellet was resuspended in Buffer C (50 mm HEPES-KOH, pH 7.8, 50 mm KCl, 300 mm NaCl, 0.1 mm EDTA, 10% glycerol) containing 1% Triton X-100 and 1× PIC, incubated with rotating at 4 °C for 20 min, and centrifuged at 12,000 × g for 10 min. The supernatant was collected as the nuclear fraction. Proteins in cell lysates and cytosolic or nuclear fractions were quantified using the DC protein assay and used for immunoblotting. Total RNA was isolated using the GenEluteTM Mammalian Total RNA Miniprep Kit (Sigma) and DNase-treated before cDNA was synthesized using SuperScript II reverse transcriptase reagent (Invitrogen) in the presence of RNase inhibitor. qRT-PCR was carried out using the SYBR green method on an Applied Biosystems 7900HT (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA). Sequences of the primers for qPCR are listed in supplemental Table 2. TetOS-dominant negative MAML1 (dnMAML1) transgenic mice were generated in house and will be described elsewhere. 5L. Chang and A. Karsan, unpublished data.. dnMAML1 mice were crossed with VE-cadherin-tTA mice (28.Sun J.F. Phung T. Shiojima I. Felske T. Upalakalin J.N. Feng D. Kornaga T. Dor T. Dvorak A.M. Walsh K. Benjamin L.E.

Benjamin, Harvard Medical School, Boston, MA), and in the double transgenic offspring, inducible expression of dnMAML1 blocks Notch activity in an endothelial cell-specific manner. Inhibition of Notch activity by dnMAML1 expression was initiated at embryonic day 8.5 (E8.5) or E9.5 by removal of tetracycline from the drinking water, cellularization of the cardiac cushion was examined at E10.5 by staining cells with DAPI, and cell number was quantified using ImageJ Software (National Institutes of Health). To examine Smad3 protein expression in the cardiac cushion cells, Notch activity was inhibited by dnMAML1 expression at E9.5, and Smad3 protein expression was examined at E10.5 by immunofluorescence staining. Smad3 protein expression was quantified using ImageJ software and normalized to total cell numbers by counting the DAPI-stained nuclei in the same area. To examine the interaction between Smad3 and NICD, HEK 293T cells were transiently transfected with pLNCX-N4IC-HA, MSCV-pac-Smad3, or both. After 48 h, cell lysates were prepared using lysis buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.6, 150 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 1% Triton X-100, 1% Nonidet P-40, and 0.1% deoxycholate) containing protease inhibitors. After preclearing, cell lysates were incubated with anti-Smad3 or anti-HA antibody at 4 °C overnight. The immunoprecipitation mixture was then incubated with protein A-agarose (for Smad3 antibody) or protein G-agarose (for HA antibody) beads for 2 h at 4 °C. After three washes with lysis buffer, the beads were resuspended with 20 μl of 2× SDS sample buffer and heated to 95 °C for 5 min. The supernatant was loaded onto 10% SDS-polyacrylamide gels for immunoblotting. HMEC transduced with empty vector or NICD were treated with 50 μg/ml of cycloheximide and cell lysates were prepared at the indicated times. Smad3 protein levels were examined by immunoblotting. The relative density of each Smad3 band compared with tubulin was expressed as the percentage of the untreated sample. HMEC with or without Dll4 coculture were left untreated or treated with 2.5 ng/ml TGFβ1 for 1 h for Smad3 chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) and 2 h for acetyl-histone H4 and trimethylated histone 3 on lysine 4 (H3K4Me3) ChIP. Cells were then cross-linked using 1% formaldehyde and harvested following lysis. After sonication, the lysates were diluted, and equal amounts of chromatin were used for ChIP with anti-Smad3, anti-acetyl-histone H4, or anti-histone H3 (trimethyl Lys4) and rabbit IgG as a negative control. Enrichment of DNA around the SBE or CSL binding sites (for Smad3 ChIP) or the proximal promoter region and/or the 5′-end of the genes (for acetyl-histone H4 and H3K4Me3) was detected using qPCR and normalized against the respective input DNA. Primer positions and sequences are listed in supplemental Tables 3 and 4. Endothelial cells signal through two TGFβ type I receptor pathways, ALK1/Smad1/5/8 and ALK5/Smad2/3 (11.Goumans M.J. Lebrin F. Valdimarsdottir G. Trends Cardiovasc. Med. 2003; 13: 301-307Crossref PubMed Scopus (281) Google Scholar, 12.Goumans M.J. Valdimarsdottir G. Itoh S. Rosendahl A. Sideras P. ten Dijke P. EMBO J. 2002; 21: 1743-1753Crossref PubMed Scopus (932) Google Scholar). To study the interaction between Notch and TGFβ, we examined the expression of R-Smads in HMEC transduced with activated Notch, NICD. Immunoblotting showed that NICD decreased Smad1 and Smad2 protein expression by 53 ± 3.9% and 55 ± 8.3%, respectively, but increased Smad3 protein 240 ± 22.9% (Fig. 1, A and B). Consistent with effects on protein expression, qRT-PCR revealed that NICD decreased mRNA levels of SMAD1 and SMAD2 by 59% ± 3.1% and 38% ± 13.7%, respectively, while increasing SMAD3 mRNA 145 ± 7.3% and not affecting SMAD5 mRNA (Fig. 1C). TGFβ stimulation induces the phosphorylation of R-Smads, which then form protein complexes with Smad4 and translocate to the nucleus. Since NICD affects the expression of R-Smads, we expected that TGFβ-induced phosphorylation of R-Smads and nuclear translocation would be altered accordingly. As shown in Fig. 1D, NICD decreased phospho-Smad1 and phospho-Smad2 levels and increased phospho-Smad3 levels consistent with changes in total R-Smad protein expression. The differential effect of Notch activation on TGFβ-induced nuclear translocation of Smad1, Smad2, and Smad3 was confirmed by immunoblotting for Smad1, Smad2, and Smad3 in cytosolic and nuclear fractions after TGFβ treatment (Fig. 1E). Since NICD affects the protein level, TGFβ-induced phosphorylation, and nuclear localization of R-Smads, we next examined the functional effects of NICD on the expression of TGFβ target genes. qRT-PCR showed that activated Notch significantly reduced the basal and TGFβ-induced levels of ALK1/Smad1 target genes SMAD6, ID1, and ID2 (Fig. 2A), and two ALK5/Smad2-dependent targets, MMP2 and NET1 (29.Phanish M.K.

In contrast to inhibition of Smad1 and Smad2 targets, NICD alone up-regulated the ALK5/Smad3 target genes PAI1, CTGF, and CYR61 (29.Phanish M.K. Wahab N.A. Colville-Nash P. Hendry B.M. Dockrell M.E.

Costimulation of Notch and TGFβ only slightly induced (<2-fold) expression of PAI1, CTGF, and CYR61 compared with TGFβ alone (Fig. 2C), suggesting a possible common signaling pathway through induction of Smad3. In contrast, a synergistic effect on the expression of ANKRD1, another TGFβ/Smad3 target gene (33.Kanai H. Tanaka T. Aihara Y. Takeda S. Kawabata M. Miyazono K. Nagai R. Kurabayashi M. Circ. Res. 2001; 88: 30-36Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar), and HEY1 was observed between NICD and TGFβ (Fig. 2D), similar to the effect we have previously noted for Snail (5.Niessen K. Fu Y. Chang L. Hoodless P.A. McFadden D. Karsan A. J. Cell Biol. 2008; 182: 315-325Crossref PubMed Scopus (265) Google Scholar). These results suggest that the effect of Notch activation on the expression of TGFβ/Smad3 targets is gene-specific. To examine whether ligand-induced Notch activation would have similar effects as NICD on TGFβ signaling pathways, we transduced HMEC with Dll4, the major Notch ligand in endothelial cells (25.Mailhos C. Modlich U. Lewis J. Harris A. Bicknell R. Ish-Horowicz D. Differentiation. 2001; 69: 135-144Crossref PubMed Scopus (261) Google Scholar), and cocultured these cells with parental HMEC at a 1:1 ratio. In keeping with the NICD findings, qRT-PCR analysis showed that Dll4-induced Notch activation decreased SMAD1 and SMAD2 mRNA expression by 40 ± 4.8% and 17 ± 2.5%, respectively, and increased SMAD3 mRNA expression 122 ± 3.2% but did not affect SMAD5 mRNA expression (Fig. 3A). Consistent with mRNA expression, Smad1 and Smad2 protein levels were decreased and Smad3 protein levels were increased by Dll4-induced Notch activation (Fig. 3B). Additionally, TGFβ-induced phosphorylation and nuclear translocation of Smad1 and Smad2 were also decreased and that of Smad3 was increased by Dll4-induced Notch activation (Fig. 3, B and C). Given that the nuclear levels of the R-Smads were proportional to cytosolic expression, it is likely that the changes in R-Smad phosphorylation and nuclear translocation are a direct reflection of R-Smad levels. Similar to NICD, Dll4-induced Notch activation inhibited the basal and TGFβ-induced mRNA levels of the ALK1/Smad1 target genes SMAD6, ID1, and ID2 (Fig. 3D) and ALK5/Smad2 target genes MMP2 and NET1 (Fig. 3E). Dll4 minimally affected the basal mRNA levels of CYR61, CTGF, and PAI1 (Fig. 3F). As with NICD, Dll4-induced Notch activation synergized with TGFβ upon inducing ANKRD1 and HEY1 expression (Fig. 3G) as well as on two classical direct Notch targets, HEY2 and HEYL (see supplemental Fig. 1). To ensure that the effects we observed in coculture of parental HMEC and Dll4-expressing HMEC reflect Dll4-induced Notch activation in parental HMEC, we flow-sorted the cocultured cells into green fluorescent protein-positive (Dll4-expressing HMEC cells) and green fluorescent protein-negative (parental HMEC) populations after TGFβ treatment and examined mRNA expression of R-Smads and TGFβ target genes in these two populations by qRT-PCR. The results confirmed that the effect of Dll4 on TGFβ signaling is due to Notch activation, since the effects were more pronounced in parental HMEC (receiving the Notch signal) than in Dll4-expressing HMEC (see supplemental Fig. 2). Taken together, our data indicate that, similar to NICD, Dll4-induced Notch activation has an inhibitory effect on Smad1 and Smad2 pathways but a positive effect on Smad3 levels, with synergistic induction of a subset of Smad3 target genes. A subset of endocardial cells initiates EndMT at E9.5 in the atrioventricular canal, which is regulated in part by Notch and TGFβ pathways (1.Armstrong E.J. Bischoff J. Circ. Res. 2004; 95: 459-470Crossref PubMed Scopus (524) Google Scholar, 5.Niessen K. Fu Y. Chang L. Hoodless P.A. McFadden D. Karsan A. J. Cell Biol. 2008; 182: 315-325Crossref PubMed Scopus (265) Google Scholar). To investigate whether Notch activity affects the expression of Smad3 during EndMT in vivo, we examined Smad3 expression in cardiac cushions of embryonic hearts from mice inducibly expressing the pan-Notch inhibitor, dnMAML1, from an endothelial promoter. 5L. Chang and A. Karsan, unpublished data.. As the mesenchymal cells are derived from the endocardium, Notch inhibition carries through into the mesenchymal cells of the cardiac cushion (34.Alva J.A. Zovein A.C. Monvoisin A. Murphy T. Salazar A. Harvey N.L. Carmeliet P. Iruela-Arispe M.L. Dev. Dyn. 2006; 235: 759-767Crossref PubMed Scopus (329) Google Scholar). 5L. Chang and A. Karsan, unpublished data.. We first examined the effect of Notch inhibition on cellularization of the cardiac cushion. Notch activity was inhibited by inducing expression of dnMAML1 at E8.5 or E9.5, and cardiac cushion cells were stained by DAPI and quantified at E10.5. Inhibition of Notch activity by dnMAML1 for 24 and 48 h resulted in a reduction of cell numbers in cardiac cushion by 46 ± 17.9 and 81 ± 11.3%, respectively, compared with littermate controls, demonstrating that inhibition of endocardial Notch activity blocks EndMT (Fig. 4, A and B). We then examined Smad3 expression in these cardiac cushion cells. Notch activity was inhibited by inducing expression of dnMAML1 at E9.5, and Smad3 protein expression in cardiac cushion cells was examined at E10.5 by immunofluorescent staining. There was reduced nuclear Smad3 localization in the cardiac cushion cells (Fig. 4C) and an overall reduction in Smad3 protein expression of 34 ± 9% per cell (Fig. 4D) when Notch activity was inhibited for 24 h compared with littermate controls. Thus, Notch activation regulates Smad3 expression in a physiologic context in vivo. Several pieces of data suggested to us that Notch also regulates Smad3 at the post-transcriptional level. First, Smad3 protein levels appeared disproportionately increased compared with the mRNA levels by NICD (Fig. 1, A and B compared with C) or by Dll4 (Figs. 3B and 6 compared with Fig. 3A). Additionally, TGFβ stimulation increased SMAD3 mRNA to a similar level as that induced by Notch activation (Fig. 1C (131 ± 7.2%) and Fig. 3A (129 ± 11%)), but the increase of Smad3 protein was only observed in cells with active Notch and not in TGFβ-stimulated cells (Figs. 1D and 3B). To test whether NICD could increase Smad3 stability, we treated HMEC transduced with vector or NICD with 50 μg/ml cycloheximide to block new protein synthesis and analyzed Smad3 protein expression by immunoblotting. As shown in Fig. 5A, loss of Smad3 protein was much slower in NICD-expressing cells than in the vector control cells, suggesting that NICD increases Smad3 protein stability. In contract, NICD did not increase the stability of Smad1 and Smad2 (Fig. 5A). Next, we examined whether expression of NICD could increase the protein level of ectopically expressed Smad3 whose expression is controlled by the viral LTR rather than the endogenous promoter. Transient transfection of 293T cells with vector or FLAG-Smad3 co-transfected with increasing amounts of NICD showed that NICD increased protein levels of ectopically transfected FLAG-Smad3 (Fig. 5B). Since the expression of FLAG-Smad3 is not controlled by the endogenous Smad3 promoter, the increase of FLAG-Smad3 protein by NICD can be attributed to regulation at a post-translational level. Although we confirmed the physical interaction between NICD and Smad3 by co-immunoprecipitation in transiently transfected 293T cells (Fig. 5C) (18.Blokzijl A. Dahlqvist C. Reissmann E. Falk A.

To further study the synergy between Notch and TGFβ signaling, we pretreated HMEC-Dll4 cocultures with an ALK5 kinase inhibitor SB431542 or a γ-secretase inhibitor, DAPT, to block Notch activation prior to TGFβ1 stimulation. Immunoblotting showed that the synergistic up-regulation of ANKRD1 and Snail was abolished by either ALK5 or Notch inhibition (Fig. 6). However, ALK5 inhibition did not affect the induction of Smad3 by Dll4 but completely blocked TGFβ-induced Smad3 phosphorylation (Fig. 6), indicating that SB431542 effectively inhibits the TGFβ/ALK5/Smad3 signaling pathway, independent of the effect of Notch on Smad3 prot"

K38Q-MCT1 and K38R-MCT1 were inactive when expressed at the plasma membrane of Xenopus laevis oocytes, whereas K45R/K282R/K413R-MCT1 and K45Q/K282Q/K413Q-MCT1 were active. The former exhibited normal reversible and irreversible inhibition by DIDS, whereas the latter showed less reversible and no irreversible inhibition. K45Q/K413Q-MCT1 retained some irreversible inhibition, whereas K45Q/K282Q-MCT1 and K282Q/K413Q-MCT1 did not. These data suggest that the two DIDS SO3− groups interact with positively charged Lys282 together with Lys45 and/or Lys413. This positions one DIDS isothiocyanate group close to Lys38, leading to its covalent modification and irreversible inhibition. Additional mutagenesis revealed that DIDS cross-links MCT1 to its ancillary protein embigin using either Lys38 or Lys290 of MCT1 and Lys160 or Lys164 of embigin. We have modeled a possible structure for the outward facing (open) conformation of MCT1 by employing modest rotations of the C-terminal domain of the inner facing conformation modeled previously. The resulting model structure has a DIDS-binding site consistent with experimental data and locates Lys38 in a hydrophobic environment at the bottom of a substrate-binding channel. Our model suggests a translocation cycle in which Lys38 accepts a proton before binding lactate. Both the lactate and proton are then passed through the channel via Asp302− and Asp306+, an ion pair already identified as important for transport and located adjacent to Phe360, which controls channel selectivity. The cross-linking data have also been used to model a structure of MCT1 bound to embigin that is consistent with published data.

Meredith D. Pflugers Arch. 2004; 447: 619-628Crossref PubMed Scopus (793) Google Scholar). All of the members of this family are thought to have 12 transmembrane alpha helices (TMs) with a large loop between TMs 6 and 7 and the C and N termini facing the cytosol (2Poole R.C. Sansom C.E.

This transport is proton-linked and leads to the net uptake or release of lactic acid from cells, which is critical for metabolic pathways such as anaerobic glycolysis, gluconeogenesis, and lactate oxidation (9Poole R.C. Halestrap A.P. Am. J. Physiol. 1993; 264: C761-782Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). MCT8 is a high affinity thyroid hormone transporter (10Friesema E.C. Ganguly S. Abdalla A. Manning Fox J.E.

The other members of the MCT family remain to be characterized.MCT1 is the most widely distributed member of the MCT family and was first identified as the lactate transporter present in red blood cells where its kinetics and substrate and inhibitor specificity were investigated in detail (9Poole R.C.

These studies revealed that MCT1 can be inhibited by stilbene disulfonate derivatives such as DIDS and 4,4′-dibenzamido-stilbene-2,2′-disulfonate (DBDS). DIDS was shown to exhibit a rapid reversible inhibition of transport that was competitive with respect to l-lactate. This is followed by a slowly developing irreversible inhibition that is not exhibited by DBDS and is thought to be caused by one of the isothiocyanate groups of DIDS attacking a lysine residue on MCT1 (13Poole R.C.

Prolonged incubation with DIDS also led to a fraction of the MCT1 becoming cross-linked to a 70-kDa glycoprotein that was identified as embigin, also known as gp70 (16Poole R.C. Halestrap A.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 14624-14628Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). Embigin has a short intracellular C terminus, a single TM sequence containing a glutamic acid residue, and a large extracellular N terminus containing two immunoglobulin domains (17Guenette R.S.

Histopathol. 2003; 18: 981-987PubMed Google Scholar). Subsequent studies revealed that either embigin or, more frequently, the homologous protein basigin (also known as CD147) is required as a chaperone to take MCT1 to the membrane (19Kirk P.

Such studies, together with homology modeling have enabled us to propose a three-dimensional structure of MCT1 based around the published structure of the Escherichia coli glycerol-3-phosphate transporter (Protein Data Bank 1PW4) (24Manoharan C. Wilson M.C. Sessions R.B. Halestrap A.P. Mol. Membr. Biol. 2006; 23: 486-498Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). This model can account for the effects of mutating a range of amino acids, including some that disrupt the interaction with basigin, and has led to the proposal that the single TM of basigin or embigin lies between TMs 3 and 6 of MCT1. The model also reveals exofacial lysines that are present in MCT1 that might be responsible for the irreversible inhibition of MCT1 by DIDS and the cross-linking of MCT1 to embigin. In rat MCT1 these residues are Lys38, Lys45, Lys282, Lys284, Lys290, and Lys413. In this paper, we use site-directed mutagenesis of these lysine residues to identify which of them are involved in DIDS binding to MCT1. In addition we use site-directed mutagenesis of embigin to demonstrate that Lys160 and Lys164 are involved in its cross-linking to MCT1. Our new data allow us to propose a modified structural model of MCT1 in its outward facing conformation that binds DIDS. This model is consistent with the site-directed mutagenesis data and also suggests a mechanism for the translocation cycle that involves Lys38 as well as Asp302 and Arg306 that have already been identified as important for transport (23Galić S.

MCT1 is the most widely distributed member of the MCT family and was first identified as the lactate transporter present in red blood cells where its kinetics and substrate and inhibitor specificity were investigated in detail (9Poole R.C.

These studies revealed that MCT1 can be inhibited by stilbene disulfonate derivatives such as DIDS and 4,4′-dibenzamido-stilbene-2,2′-disulfonate (DBDS). DIDS was shown to exhibit a rapid reversible inhibition of transport that was competitive with respect to l-lactate. This is followed by a slowly developing irreversible inhibition that is not exhibited by DBDS and is thought to be caused by one of the isothiocyanate groups of DIDS attacking a lysine residue on MCT1 (13Poole R.C.

Prolonged incubation with DIDS also led to a fraction of the MCT1 becoming cross-linked to a 70-kDa glycoprotein that was identified as embigin, also known as gp70 (16Poole R.C. Halestrap A.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 14624-14628Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). Embigin has a short intracellular C terminus, a single TM sequence containing a glutamic acid residue, and a large extracellular N terminus containing two immunoglobulin domains (17Guenette R.S.

Histopathol. 2003; 18: 981-987PubMed Google Scholar). Subsequent studies revealed that either embigin or, more frequently, the homologous protein basigin (also known as CD147) is required as a chaperone to take MCT1 to the membrane (19Kirk P. Wilson M.C. Heddle C. Brown M.H. Barclay A.N. Halestrap A.P.

Such studies, together with homology modeling have enabled us to propose a three-dimensional structure of MCT1 based around the published structure of the Escherichia coli glycerol-3-phosphate transporter (Protein Data Bank 1PW4) (24Manoharan C. Wilson M.C. Sessions R.B. Halestrap A.P. Mol. Membr. Biol. 2006; 23: 486-498Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). This model can account for the effects of mutating a range of amino acids, including some that disrupt the interaction with basigin, and has led to the proposal that the single TM of basigin or embigin lies between TMs 3 and 6 of MCT1. The model also reveals exofacial lysines that are present in MCT1 that might be responsible for the irreversible inhibition of MCT1 by DIDS and the cross-linking of MCT1 to embigin. In rat MCT1 these residues are Lys38, Lys45, Lys282, Lys284, Lys290, and Lys413. In this paper, we use site-directed mutagenesis of these lysine residues to identify which of them are involved in DIDS binding to MCT1. In addition we use site-directed mutagenesis of embigin to demonstrate that Lys160 and Lys164 are involved in its cross-linking to MCT1. Our new data allow us to propose a modified structural model of MCT1 in its outward facing conformation that binds DIDS. This model is consistent with the site-directed mutagenesis data and also suggests a mechanism for the translocation cycle that involves Lys38 as well as Asp302 and Arg306 that have already been identified as important for transport (23Galić S.

Resolution of the x-ray structure of the N-terminal CUB1-epidermal growth factor (EGF) C1s segment has led to a model of the C1q/C1s-C1r-C1r-C1s interaction where the C1q collagen stem binds at the C1r/C1s interface through ionic bonds involving acidic residues contributed by the C1r EGF module (Gregory, L. A., Thielens, N. M., Arlaud, G. J., Fontecilla-Camps, J. C., and Gaboriaud, C. (2003) J. Biol. Chem. 278, 32157–32164). To identify the C1q-binding sites of C1s-C1r-C1r-C1s, a series of C1r and C1s mutants was expressed, and the C1q binding ability of the resulting tetramer variants was assessed by surface plasmon resonance. Mutations targeting the Glu137-Glu-Asp139 stretch in the C1r EGF module had no effect on C1 assembly, ruling out our previous interaction model. Additional mutations targeting residues expected to participate in the Ca2+-binding sites of the C1r and C1s CUB modules provided evidence for high affinity C1q-binding sites contributed by the C1r CUB1 and CUB2 modules and lower affinity sites contributed by C1s CUB1. All of the sites implicate acidic residues also contributing Ca2+ ligands. C1s-C1r-C1r-C1s thus contributes six C1q-binding sites, one per C1q stem. Based on the location of these sites and available structural information, we propose a refined model of C1 assembly where the CUB1-EGF-CUB2 interaction domains of C1r and C1s are entirely clustered inside C1q and interact through six binding sites with reactive lysines of the C1q stems. This mechanism is similar to that demonstrated for mannan-binding lectin (MBL)-MBL-associated serine protease and ficolin-MBL-associated serine protease complexes.

The classical pathway of complement, a major component of innate immune defense against pathogens and altered self, is triggered by C1, a 790-kDa Ca2+-dependent complex assembled from a recognition protein C1q and C1s-C1r-C1r-C1s, a tetramer of two modular proteases, C1r and C1s, that respectively mediate activation and proteolytic activity of the complex (1.Cooper N.R.

In addition, all CUB modules contained in these structures were found to contain a hitherto unrecognized Ca2+-binding site involving three conserved acidic residues (Glu45, Asp53, and Asp98 in C1s), defining a novel CUB module subset diverging from the type originally described in the spermadhesins (20.Romero A.

The aim of this work was to use site-directed mutagenesis to delineate the sites of C1r and C1s involved in the interaction between C1s-C1r-C1r-C1s and C1q. Our data rule out our previous interaction model and provide evidence that C1 assembly involves the same basic Ca2+-dependent mechanism as demonstrated in the case of MBL-MASP and ficolin-MASP complexes. Diisopropyl phosphorofluoridate was purchased from Sigma-Aldrich. C1q was purified from human plasma as described previously (24.Arlaud G.J. Sim R.B. Duplaa A.M. Colomb M.G. Mol.

Dr. Mario Tosi (University of Rouen, Rouen, France), respectively. Oligonucleotides were purchased from MWG-BIOTECH (Courtaboeuf, France). Antibiotics and molecular biology reagents were obtained from Fermentas (Burlington, Canada). Cellfectin was from Invitrogen. The concentrations of purified proteins were determined using the following absorption coefficients (A1%, 1 cm at 280 nm) and molecular weights: C1q, 6.8 and 459,300; recombinant C1r (S637A mutant), 12.4 and 83,373; recombinant C1s (wild type), 14.5 and 77,465; and C1s-C1r-C1r-C1s tetramer assembled from recombinant C1r and C1s, 13.45 and 321,676. The molecular weights of recombinant C1r and C1s were determined by mass spectrometry analysis using the matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization technique as described previously (27.Lacroix M.

Recombinant C1r and C1s variants were expressed using a baculovirus/insect cells system. The protocol used for C1s has been previously described in detail (28.Bally I. Rossi V. Thielens N.M. Gaboriaud C. Arlaud G.J. J. Immunol. 2005; 175: 4536-4542Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). In the case of C1r, a DNA fragment encoding the signal peptide plus the full-length mature protein (amino acid residues 1–705) was amplified by PCR using the VentR polymerase. The sequences of the sense (5′-CCGGAATTCATGTGGCTCTTGTAC-3′) and antisense (5′-CCCAAGCTTTCAGTCCTCCTCCTCCA-3′) primers introduced an EcoRI restriction site (underlined) at the 5′ end of the PCR product and a HindIII site (underlined) at the 3′ end. The amplified DNA was purified using the gel extraction kit QIAquick (Qiagen) and cloned into the pCR-Script Amp SK(+) intermediate vector (Stratagene) according to the manufacturer's instructions. The fragment was excised by digestion with EcoRI and HindIII and cloned into the corresponding sites of the pFastBac1 baculovirus transfer vector (Invitrogen). The resulting construct was characterized by restriction mapping and checked by double-stranded DNA sequencing (Cogenics, Meylan, France). The expression plasmids coding for all C1r and C1s mutants were generated using the QuikChangeTM XL site-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA). The mutagenic oligonucleotides were designed according to the manufacturer's recommendations, and a silent restriction site was introduced in each case for screening of positive clones. The pFastBac1/C1s expression plasmid coding for wild type C1s was used as a template for all C1s variants. The pFastBac1/C1r S637A plasmid coding for the S637A C1r mutant was used as a template for all C1r variants. The sequences of all variants were confirmed by double-stranded DNA sequencing. The recombinant baculoviruses were generated using the Bac-to-BacTM system (Invitrogen) as described previously (13.Thielens N.M. Cseh S. Thiel S. Vorup-Jensen T. Rossi V. Jensenius J.C. Arlaud G.J. J. Immunol. 2001; 166: 5068-5077Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar). The bacmid DNA was purified using the Qiagen midiprep purification system and used to transfect Sf21 insect cells with cellfectin in Sf900 II SFM medium (Invitrogen) as recommended by the manufacturer. Recombinant virus particles were collected 4 days later and amplified as described by King and Possee (29.King L.A. Possee R.D. The Baculovirus Expression System: A Laboratory Guide. Chapman and Hall, Ltd., London1992: 111-114Google Scholar). High Five cells (1.75 × 107 cells/175-cm2 tissue culture flask) were infected with the recombinant viruses at a multiplicity of infection of 2 in SF900 II SFM medium at 28 °C for 48 h (C1s variants) or 55 h (C1r variants). The culture supernatants containing recombinant C1r or C1s were collected by centrifugation, supplemented with 1 mm diisopropyl phosphorofluoridate, and stored frozen at −20 °C until use. The relative C1r or C1s content of each culture supernatant was estimated by SDS-PAGE analysis (30.Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (207537) Google Scholar) followed by Coomassie Blue staining and gel scanning. Based on this estimate, C1r- and C1s-containing supernatants were mixed in proportions appropriate to achieve a C1r:C1s ratio of ∼1:1. The resulting mixture was dialyzed against 25 mm NaCl, 2 mm CaCl2, 50 mm triethanolamine HCl, pH 7.4, and loaded onto a Q-Sepharose Fast Flow column (Pharmacia) (50 ml) equilibrated in the same buffer. Elution was carried out by applying a linear gradient from 25 to 250 mm NaCl in the same buffer. Fractions containing the C1s-C1r-C1r-C1s tetramer were identified by SDS-PAGE analysis, pooled, and concentrated by ultrafiltration to 0.2–0.4 mg/ml. Further purification was achieved by high pressure gel filtration on either a TSK G3000 SW column (7.5 × 60 cm) (Tosoh Bioscience, Tokyo, Japan) or a Superose 6 10/300 GL column (Amersham Biosciences), each equilibrated in 145 mm NaCl, 2 mm CaCl2, 50 mm triethanolamine HCl, pH 7.4. The purified tetramer was concentrated by ultrafiltration to 0.2 mg/ml and stored at 4 °C until use. Analyses were performed using a BIAcore X instrument (GE Healthcare). C1q was immobilized on the surface of a CM5 sensor chip (GE Healthcare) using the amine coupling chemistry, as described previously (31.Cseh S. Vera L. Matsushita M. Fujita T. Arlaud G.J.

Binding of the purified C1s-C1r-C1r-C1s tetramer variants was measured over 15,000 resonance units of immobilized C1q, at a flow rate of 20 μl/min in 145 mm NaCl, 2 mm CaCl2, 50 mm triethanolamine HCl, pH 7.4, containing 0.005% surfactant P20 (GE Healthcare). Each sample was injected in parallel over a surface with immobilized bovine serum albumin for subtraction of the bulk refractive index background. Regeneration of the surfaces was achieved by injection of 10 μl of 145 mm NaCl, 5 mm EDTA, 50 mm triethanolamine HCl, pH 7.4. The data were analyzed by global fitting to a 1:1 Langmuir binding model of the association and dissociation phases simultaneously, using the BIAevaluation 3.1 software (GE Healthcare). The apparent equilibrium dissociation constants (KD) were calculated from the ratio of the dissociation and association rate constants (koff/kon). Each C1s-C1r-C1r-C1s variant was analyzed at six different concentrations, ranging from 1 to 10 nm. Experimentally determined structures were used in the case of C1s CUB1-EGF (16.Gregory L.A.

C1r CUB1 was built using the scaffold common to its counterparts in C1s, MAp19, and MASP-1/3 (16.Gregory L.A. Thielens N.M. Arlaud G.J. Fontecilla-Camps J.C. Gaboriaud C. J. Biol.

A few segments (residues 23–25, 62–67, 74–92, and 107–115) correspond to more variable areas, and their conformation is therefore somewhat arbitrary. The N-terminal residues 1–8 were not included because this stretch shows low structural and sequence homology in the available homologous structures. A Ca2+-binding site, as seen in the C1s, MAp19, and MASP-1/3 structures, was introduced in the model. Assembly of the head-to-tail C1r/C1s CUB1-EGF heterodimer was carried out using the remarkably conserved intermonomer interface seen in the human C1s, human MAp19, rat MASP-2, and human MASP-1/3 homodimeric structures (16.Gregory L.A.

Indeed, there are only a few conservative replacements in C1r compared with C1s, with Phe9, Thr13, Phe17, Gln44, Leu118, Gln122, and Val152 substituting for Tyr5, Leu9, Tyr13, Thr40, Ala109, Val113, and Ile136, respectively (16.Gregory L.A.

The relative positioning of the monomers observed in the C1s structure was used as a template, and assembly of the C1r/C1s heterodimer was achieved by superimposing the C1r CUB1 model and the NMR-derived C1r EGF structure onto one of the C1s monomers. The root mean square deviations calculated for these superimpositions were 0.9 Å (CUB1, 98 Cα pairs) and 1.04 Å (EGF, 33 Cα pairs). Homology models for C1r and C1s CUB2 were derived from the scaffold common to their counterparts in rat MASP-2 and human MASP-1/3 (18.Teillet F. Gaboriaud C. Lacroix M. Martin L. Arlaud G.J.

Subtle variations may also occur in the C1r segments 242–248 and 254–257. Initial positioning of the C1r and C1s CUB2 modules in the overall C1r-C1s CUB1-EGF-CUB2 heterodimeric structure was achieved using the plane configurations of human MASP-1/3 and rat MASP-2 as templates. The graphics program O (33.Jones T.A. Zou J.Y. Cowan S.W. Kjeldgaard M. Acta Crystallogr. A. 1991; 47: 110-119Crossref PubMed Scopus (13014) Google Scholar) was used throughout the modeling procedure. The objective of this study was to perform point mutations in various areas of the interaction domains of C1r and C1s and to measure the impact of these mutations on the assembly of the C1 complex with a view to delineate the sites of C1r and C1s responsible for the interaction between the C1s-C1r-C1r-C1s tetramer and C1q. For this purpose, C1r and C1s were expressed in a baculovirus/insect cells system and secreted in the culture supernatants, at concentrations of 1–3 and 5–10 mg/liter, respectively. The wild type C1s DNA sequence was used as a template for all of the mutations. In the case of C1r, in contrast, the template sequence used for subsequent mutations contained a Ser to Ala mutation at the active site residue Ser637. The purpose of this modification was to stabilize all C1r variants in the proenzyme form and to prevent spontaneous activation during expression and upon subsequent interaction of the reconstituted C1s-C1r-C1r-C1s tetramer with C1q. We initially attempted to express and purify recombinant C1r and C1s separately, with a view to subsequently reconstitute the C1s-C1r-C1r-C1s tetramer variants. A major drawback of this protocol arose from the relatively poor expression yield of recombinant C1r, combined with a considerable loss of protein during ion exchange purification. This did not allow us to produce purified C1r variants in sufficient amounts to perform subsequent analyses by surface plasmon resonance spectroscopy. To circumvent this problem, an alternative strategy was used. The culture supernatants containing the C1r and C1s variants were first combined in the presence of Ca2+ ions under appropriate proportions to achieve a C1r:C1s molar ratio of ∼1:1 and thereby reconstitute the C1s-C1r-C1r-C1s tetramer. The resulting mixture was then submitted to ion exchange chromatography on a Q-Sepharose Fast Flow column as described under “Experimental Procedures.” SDS-PAGE analysis of the elution profile provided evidence that C1r and C1s eluted as a single peak containing equimolar amounts of each protein (data not shown), confirming formation of the C1s-C1r-C1r-C1s tetramer. Excess C1s was observed occasionally and eluted in a peak immediately following the tetramer. All of the C1r/C1s combinations tested yielded similar elution profiles, providing a first indication that none of the mutations performed in C1r or C1s had a significant impact on the assembly of the tetramer. The tetramer pool from the ion exchange chromatography column was always contaminated by 40–50% bovine serum albumin, originating from the fetal calf serum contained in the culture medium and partially overlapping with the tetramer (Fig. 1, lanes 1 and 2). Further purification was achieved by high pressure gel permeation, allowing complete elimination of bovine serum albumin and providing further evidence that, in the presence of Ca2+ ions, all of the C1r/C1s combinations tested yielded a peak co-eluting with the “native” tetramer reconstituted from wild type C1s and the S637A C1r mutant (data not shown). As expected, gel filtration analysis in the presence of EDTA resulted in disruption of the tetramer, yielding two peaks corresponding to monomeric C1s and the C1r-C1r dimer. SDS-PAGE analysis of the purified tetramer preparation indicated that C1r and C1s each behaved as single-chain proteins under nonreducing and reducing conditions, indicative of their proenzyme state. Both C1r and C1s had similar apparent molecular masses of 85–90 kDa under reducing conditions (Fig. 1, lanes 3 and 4). A series of C1s-C1r-C1r-C1s variants were produced, and their ability to associate with C1q was analyzed by surface plasmon resonance spectroscopy, using the tetramer variants as soluble ligands and immobilized C1q. To test the validity of the interaction model derived from the x-ray structure of the C1s interaction domain (16.Gregory L.A. Thielens N.M. Arlaud G.J. Fontecilla-Camps J.C. Gaboriaud C. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 32157-32164Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar), we initially targeted acidic residues located in the C1r EGF module. Residues Glu137, Glu138, and Asp139, which form an acidic cluster in a large insertion loop of the C1r EGF module (Fig. 2), were each individually mutated to alanine, and the whole Glu137–Asp139 sequence stretch was deleted. As listed in Table 1, none of these modifications significantly decreased the ability of the resulting C1s-C1r-C1r-C1s tetramer variants to associate with C1q, with KD ratios relative to the native tetramer ranging from 0.9 to 1.4. Two other acidic residues of C1r also considered as possible C1q ligands (16.Gregory L.A. Thielens N.M. Arlaud G.J. Fontecilla-Camps J.C. Gaboriaud C. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 32157-32164Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar), Asp127 (in the EGF module) and Asp64 (in the CUB1 module), were also individually mutated to asparagine. Again, these mutations did not alter the C1q binding ability of C1s-C1r-C1r-C1s. These results were therefore clearly not compatible with a major contribution of the C1r EGF module in the tetramer/C1q interaction, ruling out our previous model of C1 assembly essentially based on this assumption (16.Gregory L.A.

Given the strong structural homology between C1r, C1s, and the MASPs, this prompted us to target residues expected to participate in the Ca2+-binding sites of the C1r and C1s CUB1 and CUB2 modules. We particularly focused our attention on the residues homologous to two of the three conserved acidic residues known to coordinate Ca2+ in C1s CUB1, Glu45 and Asp98 (Fig. 2). The reason for this choice is that, unlike the third Ca2+ ligand (homologous to Asp"

In particular, it is unclear whether its kinase activity is required for signaling or for maintaining protein stability. We have investigated the expression level of different retrovirally expressed kinase-dead Rip2 mutants and the role of Rip2 kinase activity in the signaling events that follow Nod1 and Nod2 stimulation. We show that in primary cells expressing kinase-inactive Rip2, protein levels were severely compromised, and stability could not be reconstituted by the addition of a phospho-mimetic mutation in its autophosphorylation site. Consequently, inflammatory cytokine production in response to Nod1 and Nod2 ligands was abrogated both in vitro and in vivo in the absence of Rip2 kinase activity. Our results highlight the central role that Rip2 kinase activity plays in conferring stability to the protein and thus in the preservation of Nod1- and Nod2-mediated innate immune responses.

Rip2 contains a caspase-recruitment domain (CARD), which mediates interaction with other CARD-containing proteins such as Nod1 and Nod2, in addition to an N-terminal kinase domain and an intermediate domain. Nod1 and Nod2 associate with Rip2 upon peptidoglycan ligation (17.Inohara N. Koseki T. Lin J. del Peso L. Lucas P.C. Chen F.F. Ogura Y. Núñez G. J. Biol.

Recent reports have suggested that the mitogen-activated protein kinase kinase kinase family member TAK1 provides the link between Rip2 and NF-κB activation upon Nod1 and Nod2 stimulation (21.Hasegawa M.

However, the exact role of Rip2 and in particular its kinase activity in mediating downstream effector activation in NLR signaling still remains unclear. Notably, in vitro investigations have suggested that Rip2 kinase activity may be dispensable for the induction of immune responses initiated by NLR-ligands (21.Hasegawa M. Fujimoto Y. Lucas P.C.

Lang C. Peggie M. Plater L.A. Cohen P. Biochem. J. 2007; 404: 179-190Crossref PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar); however, such studies utilized protein overexpression in cell lines and are yet to be tested in primary cells or in vivo. In the current investigation we sought to elucidate the role of Rip2 kinase activity in transducing inflammatory signals upon NLR stimulation in vitro and in vivo. To this end, we utilized both Rip2 knock-out (15.Kobayashi K. Inohara N. Hernandez L.D. Galán J.E. Núñez G. Janeway C.A. Medzhitov R. Flavell R.A.

We show here that in the absence of intact kinase activity, Rip2 protein is not stable and that insertion of a phospho-mimetic mutation is not sufficient to restore stability. Moreover, pharmacological abrogation of Rip2 kinase activity in primary cells similarly leads to destabilization of the molecule. As a consequence, signaling downstream of Nod1 and Nod2 and inflammatory cytokine production is impaired both in vivo and in vitro. Our results highlight Rip2 kinase activity as a central regulator of protein stability and consequently innate immune responses triggered by Nod1 and Nod2 ligands.

Bone marrow-derived dendritic cells were generated from bone marrow cells cultured for 10 days in complete RPMI medium supplemented with granulocyte macrophage-colony-stimulating factor. At day 10, the cells were incubated with LPS, MDP or FK565. For intracellular cytokine staining, the cells were activated for 6 h, and 10 μg/ml brefeldin A was added to the cultures for the final 3 h. Alternatively, DCs were activated overnight, and supernatant was collected for ELISA. For kinase inhibition studies, BM-DCs were incubated for 24 h with 10 μm SB203580 or 0.1 μm BIRB0796 and then lysed for Western blot. Bone marrow-derived macrophages (BM-DMs) were prepared from bone marrow cells cultured for 7 days in complete RPMI medium supplemented with 10% L929 supernatant containing macrophage-stimulating factor. For detection of intracellular cytokine production, BM-DCs were stained with biotin-conjugated anti-CD11c mAb (BD Biosciences), PercP-labeled streptavidin (BD Bioscience) and, after fixation, with fluorescein isothiocyanate-labeled anti-tumor necrosis factor-α mAb, phosphatidylethanolamine-labeled anti-IL-6 mAb, and allophycocyanin-labeled anti-IL-12p40 mAb (all from eBioscience). The cells were washed and analyzed by flow cytometry (FACSCalibur®; Becton Dickinson) and FlowJo software (Tree Star, Inc.). For cytokine detection in supernatants from activated BM-DCs, alkaline phosphatase-dependent ELISA was performed. Anti-IL-6 and anti-IL-12p40 mAb were purchased from eBioscience. For chemokine and Rip2 mRNA detection, total RNA was isolated from activated BM-DMs and subjected to reverse transcription using SuperScript III RT (Invitrogen). Quantitative real time reverse transcription-PCR was performed using Brilliant SYBR Green (Stratagene) on an iCycler (Bio-Rad). Expression was normalized to the housekeeping gene glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase. Naïve C57BL/6, Rip2 knock-out, and Rip2 K47A knock-in mice were primed by intraperitoneal injection of MDP (500 μg) and challenged by intraperitoneal LPS injection (250 μg) 24 h after priming and monitored for general condition and survival. Blood samples were collected in EDTA before MDP immunization and 1.5 h after LPS challenge. Serum was analyzed for cytokine levels by ELISA. Monoclonal antibody against Rip2 (clone Nick-1) was purchased from Santa Cruz Biotechnology. Antibodies against the phosphorylated form of p38, ERK, JNK, and IκB-α were purchased from Cell Signaling. Polyclonal antibody against β-actin was purchased from Santa Cruz Biotechnology. Stimulated cells were lysed in Triton X-100 buffer containing protease inhibitors. The lysates were loaded on SDS-PAGE gels, transferred to nitrocellulose membranes, and immunoblotted with the primary antibodies followed by incubation with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibodies (Southern Biotechnology). Proteins were detected by ECL. cDNA encoding wild type or mutated forms of Rip2 were cloned into pMY-IRES-GFP retroviral vectors (27.Kitamura T. Koshino Y. Shibata F. Oki T. Nakajima H. Nosaka T.

Achacoso P. Nolan G.P. Current Protocols in Immunology. John Wiley and Sons, Inc., New York2001Google Scholar). Bone marrow cells were isolated from Rip2-deficient mice previously injected with 5′-fluorouracil (29.Crcareva A. Saito T. Kunisato A. Kumano K. Suzuki T. Sakata-Yanagimoto M. Kawazu M. Stojanovic A.

Infected, stem cell-enriched bone marrow cells were then cultured in the presence of IL-6, IL-3, and stem cell factor. After 6 days of culture, infected GFP-expressing cells were sorted using a FACSVantage SE (Becton Dickinson). Rip2 has been reported to regulate downstream signaling of NLRs; however, the importance of its kinase activity in primary cells and in vivo is unknown. We first sought to establish the requirements for Rip2 and its kinase activity in the signaling events following Nod1 and Nod2 stimulation in primary cells in vitro. Accordingly, we generated BM-DCs from naive C57BL/6, Rip2-deficient mice, and Rip2 kinase-inactive knock-in mice (Rip2 K47A). In the latter, the residue crucial for ATP binding, lysine 47, is mutated to alanine. Wild type, Rip2 knock-out, and knock-in dendritic cells were then stimulated with the Nod1 and Nod2 ligands, FK565 and MDP, respectively. Inflammatory cytokine production by the activated BM-DCs was determined after 6 h by intracellular staining and flow cytometry (Fig. 1A) or after 24 h in culture supernatant by ELISA (Fig. 1B, left panel). Although MDP and FK565 alone poorly induced cytokine secretion, cooperative induction of IL-6, IL-12p40, and tumor necrosis factor-α was observed in wild type cells when these ligands were administered together with LPS. Cells from Rip2-deficient mice did not respond to MDP or FK565 alone, nor in combination with LPS, confirming the importance of Rip2 in Nod1 and Nod2 responses. Notably, Rip2 kinase-inactive BM-DCs exhibited a similarly impaired cytokine response upon stimulation with MDP and FK565, indicating that an intact kinase activity was required for Nod1- and Nod2-induced cytokine responses. In addition to inflammatory cytokines, microbial products also induce chemokine secretion. In particular, stimulation with a synthetic Nod1 ligand has been shown to induce chemokines such as KC (also known as CXCL1) in vitro and in vivo (30.Masumoto J. Yang K. Varambally S. Hasegawa M. Tomlins S.A. Qiu S. Fujimoto Y. Kawasaki A. Foster S.J. Horie Y. Mak T.W. Núñez G. Chinnaiyan A.M. Fukase K. Inohara N. J. Exp. Med. 2006; 203: 203-213Crossref PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar, 31.Park J.H. Kim Y.G. Shaw M. Kanneganti T.D. Fujimoto Y. Fukase K. Inohara N. Núñez G. J. Immunol. 2007; 179: 514-521Crossref PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar). Our aim was to determine whether Rip2 kinase activity was involved in chemokine production upon NLR stimulation. We thus generated bone marrow-derived macrophages from C57BL/6, Rip2 knock-out, and Rip2 knock-in mice and stimulated them with MDP and FK565 alone or together with LPS. After 6 h, total RNA was isolated and reverse-transcribed, and KC mRNA expression was determined by quantitative real time PCR analysis (Fig. 1B, right panel). There was a 10–30-fold increase in KC mRNA expression when wild type cells were stimulated with FK565 or MDP together with LPS. Comparatively, stimulation of both Rip2 deficient and kinase-dead cells did not lead to KC mRNA transcription. These results are in line with the cytokine data and highlight a role for Rip2 kinase activity in inflammatory responses following stimulation with bacterial products. To test our in vitro results, we investigated whether the abrogation of Rip2 kinase activity also resulted in impaired NLR-mediated inflammation in vivo. It has previously been shown that MDP administration renders mice more susceptible to LPS-induced endotoxic shock (32.Kobayashi K.S. Chamaillard M. Ogura Y. Henegariu O. Inohara N. Nuñez G. Flavell R.A. Science. 2005; 307: 731-734Crossref PubMed Scopus (1489) Google Scholar). Accordingly, we sensitized wild type, Rip2 knock-out, and Rip2 kinase-inactive mice with MDP and subsequently challenged with LPS. Inflammatory cytokine levels in the serum were measured 1.5 h after LPS administration (Fig. 1C). A strong synergy between MDP and LPS was evident in wild type mice as shown by significantly higher levels of IL-6 and IL-12p40 as compared with stimulation with single ligands; however, this synergy was not observed in the serum of Rip2 kinase-inactive or knock-out mice, where only the effect of LPS was detected. Thus, also in vivo the absence of Rip2 kinase activity leads to impaired inflammatory cytokine production upon MDP stimulation. Notably, injection of ultrapure LPS alone induced similar levels of IL-6 and IL-12 in all groups of mice, further excluding a critical role for Rip2 in mediating Toll-like receptor 4 signaling. The cytokine storm induced by LPS during an endotoxic shock can lead to organ dysfunction and eventually death (33.Hotchkiss R.S. Nicholson D.W. Nat. Rev. Immunol. 2006; 6: 813-822Crossref PubMed Scopus (609) Google Scholar). We therefore monitored the survival of mice injected with MDP or PBS and challenged with LPS (Fig. 1D). Wild type mice sensitized with PBS (right panel) showed a better survival rate than their MDP-immunized counterparts, all of which succumbed to LPS challenge by day 4 (left panel). Conversely, we did not observe any significant difference in survival between Rip2 knock-out or knock-in mice sensitized with either MDP or PBS, indicating that no immune response to this Nod2 ligand took place in the absence of an intact Rip2 kinase domain. Our results indicate that Rip2 deficiency and kinase inactivation both lead to abrogated signaling following NLR stimulation. Notably, different reports showed that a mutation in the Rip2 kinase residue, lysine 47, leads to a decrease in protein expression (23.Windheim M. Lang C. Peggie M. Plater L.A. Cohen P. Biochem. J. 2007; 404: 179-190Crossref PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar, 24.Lu C. Wang A. Dorsch M. Tian J. Nagashima K. Coyle A.J. Jaffee B. Ocain T.D. Xu Y. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 16278-16283Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). To further investigate the role of Rip2 kinase activity on the stability of the protein, we assessed Rip2 expression under steady state conditions or after stimulation with LPS in bone marrow-derived macrophages. Wild type, Rip2 knock-in, or Rip2 knock-out cells were stimulated with LPS for 6 and 24 h, and protein expression was analyzed by Western blot. In line with previous reports, we found that protein levels of the kinase-dead Rip2 mutant were lower in BM-DMs as compared with its wild type counterparts (Fig. 2A). Moreover, we found that activation with LPS was not sufficient to restore Rip2 expression in knock-in cells as proposed elsewhere (24.Lu C. Wang A. Dorsch M. Tian J. Nagashima K. Coyle A.J. Jaffee B. Ocain T.D. Xu Y. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 16278-16283Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). We next sought to determine whether introduction of the K47A mutation would negatively regulate transcription or mRNA stability of the Rip2 gene and thus lead to decreased protein levels. To this purpose Rip2 mRNA expression was determined in wild type, Rip2 knock-in, and Rip2 knock-out BM-DMs by quantitative real time PCR. We did not observe any impairment in Rip2 gene transcription in the knock-in cells when compared with the wild type counterparts, both in the presence or in the absence of LPS (Fig. 2B). These results indicate that K47A mutation affects Rip2 protein levels as opposed to RNA; yet the possible causes for the instability of the kinase remain to be clarified. Replacement of a lysine with the uncharged and hydrophobic amino acid alanine in the K47A kinase-dead mutation could potentially lead to misfolding of the Rip2 protein. Alternatively, Rip2 kinase activity might play a direct role in controlling the stability of the protein, so that its inactivation would affect protein expression levels. This latter hypothesis is supported by a previous investigation by Windheim et al. (23.Windheim M. Lang C. Peggie M. Plater L.A. Cohen P. Biochem. J. 2007; 404: 179-190Crossref PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar) indicating that the expression levels of wild type Rip2 in transfected cells could be decreased following treatment with the kinase inhibitor SB203580. We sought to further investigate the influence of Rip2 kinase inhibitors on endogenous protein expression in primary cells. Accordingly, BM-DCs were generated from wild type mice and incubated with SB203580, a p38 kinase inhibitor, which was previously shown to efficiently inhibit Rip2 kinase activity. Additionally, BM-DCs were treated with BIRB0796, which strongly inhibits p38 but has no effect on Rip2. Rip2 protein levels were then analyzed by Western blot before, as well as 24 h after treatment. In support of the previous results, we observed a decrease in Rip2 protein levels in response to the kinase inhibitor SB203580 as compared with both nontreated and BIRB0796-treated cells (Fig. 2C). These data further indicate that Rip2 kinase activity is directly involved in mediating the stability of the protein even under steady state conditions. To rule out a potential misfolding of the protein caused by the introduction of the uncharged amino acid alanine, we generated a new mutation in which lysine 47 is replaced by the more similar amino acid arginine. Wild type and K47R Rip2 mutant gene sequences were cloned into retroviral pMY-IRES-GFP vectors, and the resulting retroviruses were used to infect Rip2-deficient bone-marrow cells. GFP-positive cells expressing wild type or K47R mutant Rip2 were FACS-sorted and lysed, and the level of Rip2 protein expression was analyzed by Western blot. As shown in Fig. 2D, protein expression of the Rip2 K47R mutant was still reduced as compared with the retrovirally expressed wild type Rip2, suggesting that protein instability is not due to a charge difference but to the inactivation of the enzymatic activity. Because Rip2 has been shown to undergo autophosphorylation only in the presence of an intact kinase activity (34.Dorsch M. Wang A. Cheng H. Lu C. Bielecki A. Charron K. Clauser K. Ren H. Polakiewicz R.D. Parsons T. Li P. Ocain T. Xu Y. Cell Signal. 2006; 18: 2223-2229Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar), it can be speculated that this is an important mechanism by which the protein stabilizes itself. Serine 176 has been mapped as a Rip2 autophosphorylation site, and mutation of this amino acid influences kinase activity (34.Dorsch M. Wang A. Cheng H. Lu C. Bielecki A. Charron K. Clauser K. Ren H. Polakiewicz R.D. Parsons T. Li P. Ocain T. Xu Y. Cell Signal. 2006; 18: 2223-2229Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). Because the protein must be stable to determine its role in the course of signaling events, we sought to generate a stable kinase-inactive Rip2 mutant by mimicking autophosphorylation; for this purpose serine 176 was replaced by the negatively charged phospho-mimetic glutamic acid. We cloned the S176E mutation into our retroviral plasmid expressing the Rip2 mutant K47R and subsequently infected Rip2-deficient bone marrow cells. Expression of the K47R/S176E Rip2 double mutant was compared with wild type and K47R Rip2 protein expression. We found that introduction of the S176E phospho-mimetic mutation did not lead to a stable kinase-inactive mutant, because protein expression was comparable with the Rip2 K47R mutant (Fig. 2D). However, it remains possible that other serine amino acids, such as in the intermediate or CARD domain are also involved in autophosphorylation and thus might support protein stability. Our results indicate that Rip2 kinase activity is required to preserve inflammatory immune responses following Nod1 and Nod2 stimulation in vivo and in vitro. Specifically, we speculate that Rip2 kinase activity primarily functions to stabilize Rip2 expression levels such that it can participate in the signaling cascade downstream of Nod1 and Nod2. Nevertheless, a role for Rip2 kinase activity in directly phosphorylating downstream effector molecules in vivo remains to be elucidated and cannot be excluded. Rip2 has previously been shown to mediate phosphorylation of different signaling molecules in vitro (19.Navas T.A. Baldwin D.T. Stewart T.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 33684-33690Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar, 35.Ruefli-Brasse A.A. Lee W.P. Hurst S. Dixit V.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 1570-1574Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar), as well as to induce IKK-γ/NEMO ubiquitinylation, thereby controlling NF-κB activation (25.Abbott D.W. Wilkins A. Asara J.M. Cantley L.C. Curr. Biol. 2004; 14: 2217-2227Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (319) Google Scholar). Moreover, recent reports describe TAK1 kinase as the crucial effector molecule downstream of Rip2 in NLR signaling (21.Hasegawa M. Fujimoto Y. Lucas P.C. Nakano H. Fukase K. Núñez G. Inohara N. EMBO J. 2008; 27: 373-383Crossref PubMed Scopus (399) Google Scholar, 22.Kim J.Y. Omori E. Matsumoto K. Núñez G. Ninomiya-Tsuji J. J. Biol. Chem. 2008; 283: 137-144Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar), and Rip2 overexpression has been shown to mediate TAK1 phosphorylation and activation (23.Windheim M. Lang C. Peggie M. Plater L.A. Cohen P. Biochem. J. 2007; 404: 179-190Crossref PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar). Hasegawa et al. (21.Hasegawa M. Fujimoto Y. Lucas P.C. Nakano H. Fukase K. Núñez G. Inohara N. EMBO J. 2008; 27: 373-383Crossref PubMed Scopus (399) Google Scholar) additionally showed that Rip2 polyubiquitinylation is required for interaction with TAK1 and subsequent NF-κB activation. It is of note that the NF-κB activation was achieved by inducing protein overexpression and oligomerization and not by activation via Nod1 and Nod2 ligands. In our system we activated wild type, Rip2 knock-in, and Rip2 knock-out BM-DMs with MDP and analyzed phosphorylation of signaling molecules, including the NF-κB-inhibitor IκB-α. The results shown in Fig. 2E indicate that under these more physiological conditions, NF-κB and mitogen-activated protein kinase activation did not take place in the absence of Rip2 kinase activity. Taken together, our in vitro and in vivo data show that the serine/threonine kinase, Rip2, is a central regulator of NLR-induced immune responses. Although the exact role of Rip2 kinase activity in the activation of signaling molecules still remains to be elucidated, our results highlight the importance of an intact kinase domain in preserving adequate Rip2 protein levels and thus in ensuring the efficient transmission of Nod1 and Nod2 signals. Accordingly, inhibition of Rip2 kinase activity abrogates signaling downstream of Nod1 and Nod2, and may thus prove to be a valid therapeutic strategy for the treatment of inflammatory diseases linked to the dysregulated activity of these intracellular receptors (36.Chamaillard M. Philpott D. Girardin S.E. Zouali H. Lesage S. Chareyre F. Bui T.H. Giovannini M. Zaehringer U. Penard-Lacronique V. Sansonetti P.J. Hugot J.P. Thomas G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci.

https://openalex.org/W2023891029,"Rhizosecretion is an attractive technology for the production of recombinant proteins from transgenic plants. However, to date, yields of plant-derived recombinant pharmaceuticals by this method have been too low for commercial viability. Studies conducted focused on three transgenic plant lines grown in hydroponic culture medium, two expressing monoclonal antibodies Guy's 13 and 4E10 and one expressing a small microbicide polypeptide cyanovirin-N. Rhizosecretion rates increased significantly by the addition of the plant growth regulator alpha-naphthalene acetic acid. The maximum rhizosecretion rates achieved were 58 microg/g root dry weight/24 h for Guy's 13, 10.43 microg/g root dry weight/24 h for 4E10, and 766 microg/g root dry weight/24 h for cyanovirin-N, the highest figures so far reported for a full-length antibody and a recombinant protein, respectively. The plant growth regulators indole-butyric acid, 6-benzylaminopurine, and kinetin were also demonstrated to increase rhizosecretion of Guy's 13. The effect of the growth regulators differed, as alpha-naphthalene acetic acid and indole-butyric acid increased the root dry weight of hydroponic plants, whereas the cytokinins benzylaminopurine and kinetin increased rhizosecretion without affecting root mass. A comparative glycosylation analysis between MAb Guy's 13 purified from either hydroponic culture medium or from leaf extracts demonstrated a similar pattern of glycosylation comprising high mannose to complex glycoforms. Analysis of the hydroponic culture medium at harvest revealed significantly lower and less complex levels of proteolytic enzymes, in comparison with leaf extracts, which translated to a higher proportion of intact Guy's 13 IgG in relation to other IgG products. Hydroponic medium could be added directly to a chromatography column for affinity purification, allowing simple and rapid production of high purity Guy's 13 antibody. In addition to the attractiveness of controlled cultivation within a contained environment for pharmaceutical-producing plants, this study demonstrates advantages with respect to the quality and downstream purification of recombinant proteins."

Likewise, Plk1 was suggested to act as a negative regulator of tumor suppressor p53, but the mechanism remains to be determined.

Oncogene. 2005; 24: 287-291Crossref PubMed Scopus (344) Google Scholar). Thus, Plk1 has been proposed as a novel diagnostic marker for cancers. Accumulating evidence suggests that Plk1 negatively regulates the function of the tumor suppressor p53, whose loss-of-function mutations have been observed in nearly 50% of human tumors (1.Eckerdt F. Yuan J. Strebhardt K. Oncogene. 2005; 24: 267-276Crossref PubMed Scopus (328) Google Scholar). In our earlier studies, we were the first to demonstrate that Plk1 depletion results in increased p53 level in HeLa cells (3.Liu X. Erikson R.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci.

Subsequently, it was shown that Plk1 directly binds to the DNA-binding domain of p53 through its N-terminal kinase domain and inhibits the transactivation as well as the proapoptotic function of p53 (5.Ando K.

Gene. 1999; 235: 93-101Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). Although Topors is widely expressed in normal human tissues, its expression is decreased or undetectable in colon, lung, and brain adenocarcinomas, indicating that it might function as a tumor suppressor (8.Saleem A.

Topors contains an N-terminal C3HC4-type RING domain that is closely related in sequence to the RING domains of known E3 ligases (see Fig. 1A) and is the first example of a protein that has both ubiquitin and SUMO-1 E3 ligase activity. Topors functions as an E3 ubiquitin ligase for p53 and NKX3.1, and Topors-mediated ubiquitination leads to the degradation of these proteins (9.Rajendra R. Malegaonkar D. Pungaliya P. Marshall H.

Substrates of the SUMO-1 E3 ligase activity of Topors include DNA topoisomerase I and p53 (11.Weger S. Hammer E. Heilbronn R.

In contrast to ubiquitination-induced protein degradation, Topors-induced p53 sumoylation is accompanied by an increase in the level of p53 protein (11.Weger S. Hammer E. Heilbronn R. FEBS Lett. 2005; 579: 5007-5012Crossref PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar). Taken together, these studies indicate that Topors functions both as an ubiquitin and as a SUMO-1 E3 ligase for p53. Therefore, it is likely that the effects of Topors on p53 depend on cellular context (10.Guan B. Pungaliya P. Li X. Uquillas C. Mutton L.N. Rubin E.H. Bieberich C.J. J. Biol.

Significantly, we demonstrate that the Plk1-mediated phosphorylation of Topors results in reduced sumoylation of p53, whereas the ubiquitination activity toward p53 is increased, thereby facilitating p53 degradation. Cell culture, transfections, kinase assays, immunoblotting, and metabolic labeling are described in the supplemental Experimental Procedures.

Recent studies have demonstrated the Plk1 is involved in pX-induced hepatocyte transformation using an in vitro pX-expressing cellular model (Studach et al. (28.Studach L.L. Rakotomalala L. Wang W.H. Hullinger R.L. Cairo S. Buendia M.A. Andrisani O.M. Hepatology. 2009; (in press)PubMed Google Scholar)). Furthermore, Topors was identified as a gene whose depletion via a small interfering RNA library screen rescued pX-expressing cells from DNA damage-induced apoptosis. 4W. H. Wang and O. M. Andrisani, unpublished data. Based on these findings, we explored the possibility of potential direct connection between Plk1 and Topors. To test whether Topors is a binding partner of Plk1, a co-immunoprecipitation experiment was performed. As shown in supplemental Fig. 1A, the Plk1 protein was specifically pulled down by the anti-GFP antibody from lysates of cells expressing GFP-Topors, indicating an association between Topors and Plk1. To examine the interaction between the relevant endogenous proteins, HeLa cells were treated with hydroxyurea or nocodazole, and total cell lysates were subjected to anti-Topors IP followed by anti-Plk1 Western blot. As shown in supplemental Fig. 1B, Plk1 co-immunoprecipitates with Topors using lysates from cells synchronized in S and M phases. Considering the in vivo interaction between Topors and Plk1, we investigated whether Plk1 phosphorylates Topors. We performed in vitro Plk1 kinase assays, employing affinity-purified GST-Plk1 expressed in baculovirus-infected Hi5 insect cells and affinity-purified GST-Topors, the N-terminal (amino acids 1–510) or C-terminal fragments (aa 511–1045), in the presence of [γ-32P]ATP. As shown in Fig. 1B, C-terminal Topors, but not N-terminal Topors, was phosphorylated by Plk1 efficiently, indicating that C-terminal Topors is a Plk1 substrate. To identify the phosphorylation site(s), four shorter Topors fragments (aa 1–250, 251–510, 511–760, and 756–1045) were purified and subjected to Plk1 kinase reactions. Only the fragment containing amino acids 511–760 yielded a strong phosphorylation signal (Fig. 1C). Moreover, a similar experiment with three additional non-overlapping Topors fragments (aa 511–596, 597–678, and 679–760) revealed that that only the fragment spanning amino acids 679–760 was phosphorylated by Plk1 (Fig. 1D). Next, to map the potential phosphorylation site(s) for Plk1, we mutated every serine/threonine in the fragment spanning aa 679–760 into alanine. When compared with the phosphorylation level of WT-Topors (aa 679–760), the phosphorylation level of S718A-Topors was completely abolished, indicating that Ser718 is the phosphorylation site for Plk1 (Fig. 1E). Significantly, the sequence context of the Plk1 phosphorylation site that we have mapped in Topors is 717ESSY720. Earlier studies by others have determined that Plk1 prefers a negatively charged residue in the nearby sequence (15.Nakajima H. Toyoshima-Morimoto F. Taniguchi E. Nishida E. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 25277-25280Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (266) Google Scholar, 16.Wu Z.Q. Liu X. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2008; 105: 1919-1924Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar, 17.Wu Z.Q. Yang X. Weber G. Liu X. J. Biol. Chem. 2008; 283: 25503-25513Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). Thus, the sequence context of the Plk1 phosphorylation site in Topors (717ESSY720) matches this rule. To examine whether Plk1-dependent phosphorylation of Topors occurs in vivo, metabolic labeling experiments were performed. HEK293T cells were transfected with Myc-Topors (WT or S718A), retransfected with double-stranded RNA to deplete Plk1, treated with nocodazole, and metabolically labeled with [32P]orthophosphate. Topors was immunoprecipitated with an anti-Myc antibody, and the level of Topors phosphorylation was determined (Fig. 1F). The mutation S718A significantly reduced Topors phosphorylation, suggesting that Ser718 is the major site phosphorylated in vivo under these conditions. Moreover, depletion of Plk1 also reduced the phosphorylation of Topors, indicating that Plk1 does phosphorylate Topors in vivo (Fig. 1F). Moreover, the C-terminal fragment of Topors was expressed and analyzed in vivo. As shown in supplemental Fig. 2, overexpressed GFP-Topors, both in WT and in the S718A mutant, localizes in punctate nuclear regions associated with promyelocytic leukemia nuclear bodies (18.Rasheed Z.A. Saleem A. Ravee Y. Pandolfi P.P. Rubin E.H. Exp. Cell Res. 2002; 277: 152-160Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). In contrast, GFP-Topors-aa 679–760, both in the WT and in the S718A mutant, is detected throughout the cell with the same localization pattern as GFP (supplemental Fig. 2). Metabolic labeling experiments indicated that this fragment of Topors is not phosphorylated in vivo (supplemental Fig. 2B), likely due to the mislocalization of the protein fragment (supplemental Fig. 2A). To explore the role of Plk1-mediated phosphorylation of Topors, U2OS cells were generated that stably express Myc-Topors (WT or S718A). As shown in Fig. 2A, the expression level of Myc-Topors (WT or S718A) is similar in the stably transfected cells. Because Topors is a dual ubiquitin and SUMO E3 ligase, modulating the stability of p53 (9.Rajendra R. Malegaonkar D. Pungaliya P. Marshall H. Rasheed Z. Brownell J. Liu L.F. Lutzker S. Saleem A. Rubin E.H. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 36440-36444Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar, 11.Weger S. Hammer E. Heilbronn R. FEBS Lett. 2005; 579: 5007-5012Crossref PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar), we asked whether the Plk1-mediated phosphorylation of Topors regulates p53 stability. To address this question, U2OS cells stably expressing Myc-Topors (WT or S718A) were subjected to an anti-p53 Western blot. Consistent with a previous report (9.Rajendra R. Malegaonkar D. Pungaliya P. Marshall H. Rasheed Z. Brownell J. Liu L.F. Lutzker S. Saleem A. Rubin E.H. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 36440-36444Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar), expression of WT-Topors led to a slight reduction in the protein level of p53. In striking contrast, the level of p53 protein was significantly elevated in cells expressing S718A-Topors (Fig. 2B, left three lanes). Considering that p53 is stabilized in response to DNA damage, similar experiments were performed in the presence of VP-16, a topoisomerase II inhibitor, used to induce DNA double strand breaks (19.Mok T.S. Wong H. Zee B. Yu K.H. Leung T.W. Lee T.W. Yim A. Chan A.T. Yeo W. Chak K. Johnson P. Cancer. 2002; 95: 1511-1519Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). In the presence of VP-16, the p53 level of cells expressing S718A-Topors was still significantly higher than that of cells expressing WT-Topors, suggesting that Plk1 phosphorylation of Topors negatively regulates p53 stability in a DNA damage-independent manner (Fig. 2B, right three lanes). Consistent with the above observation, p21, whose transcription is under control of p53, is clearly elevated in cells expressing S718A-Topors (supplemental Fig. 3A). The increased level of p53 protein in U2OS cells expressing S718A-Topors could be due to either an increased level of protein translation or a reduced rate of protein degradation. To distinguish between these two possibilities, we quantified the half-life of p53 after treatment with cycloheximide, a protein translation inhibitor (20.Takano Y.S. Harmon B.V. Kerr J.F. J. Pathol. 1991; 163: 329-336Crossref PubMed Scopus (166) Google Scholar). First, U2OS cells stably expressing Topors (WT or S781A) were treated with cycloheximide for different times and analyzed by an anti-p53 Western blot. Cycloheximide treatment resulted in a gradual decrease in the level of p53 in cells expressing WT-Topors but not in cells expressing S718A-Topors, suggesting that the S718A mutation prevents p53 degradation (Fig. 2C and supplemental Fig. 4A). This result agrees with our earlier observations that Plk1 depletion leads to an elevation in the level of p53 in HeLa cells (3.Liu X. Erikson R.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2003; 100: 5789-5794Crossref PubMed Scopus (436) Google Scholar). To examine whether this is a general phenomenon or a cell type-dependent event, U2OS cells were depleted of Plk1 by RNA interference (3.Liu X. Erikson R.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2003; 100: 5789-5794Crossref PubMed Scopus (436) Google Scholar), treated with cycloheximide, and analyzed by an anti-p53 Western blot. As indicated, the half-life of p53 increased from less than 20 min in control U2OS cells to about 2 h following Plk1 depletion (Fig. 2D and supplemental Fig. 4B). These results indicate that p53 stabilization in response to Plk1 depletion is likely to be a general phenomenon. To further confirm these observations, we analyzed p53 degradation in U2OS cells stably expressing WT-Topors. In these cells, Plk1 depletion also strongly prevented p53 degradation (Fig. 2E and supplemental Fig. 4C) in a pattern almost identical to that in S718A-Topors-expressing cells (Fig. 2C, right four lanes), confirming that Plk1-mediated phosphorylation of Topors promotes p53 degradation. Finally, we compared the stability of p53 in cells expressing different forms of Topors (WT or S718A) after Plk1 depletion. As expected, although p53 degradation was almost completely blocked in S178A-Topors-expressing cells, p53 was also significantly stabilized in cells expressing WT-Topors (Fig. 2F and supplemental Fig. 4D). Because the level of p53 immunostaining in S178A-Topors-expressing cells is very pronounced, only 10% of lysate was loaded in Fig. 2F, right four lanes, resulting in the low level of Mek1 used as our internal control. To determine the half-life of p53 in cells expressing different forms of Topors (WT or S718A) by quantification, we needed to control p53 Western signals of cells expressing S718A-Topors in a liner range. For that purpose, we deliberately underloaded the S718A samples (Fig. 2F and supplemental Fig. 3B). The amount of lysate loaded in the right four lanes (S718A samples) was only 10% of that in the left four lanes (WT samples), as indicated by Mek1 Western blotting. Therefore, the apparent low Mek1 levels in cells expressing S718A-Topors is not a phenotype (Fig. 2F and supplemental Fig. 3B) because the Mek1 levels of cells expressing S718A-Topors were the same as those of cells expressing WT-Topors if the same amount of lysates was loaded (Fig. 2C). Considering that Topors functions both as a ubiquitin and as a SUMO-1 E3 ligase for p53, we asked whether the Plk1-dependent phosphorylation of Topors is involved in the sumoylation or ubiquitination of p53. Toward this end, U2OS cells stably expressing Topors (WT or S718A) were transfected with YFP-SUMO-1 and analyzed by an anti-p53 Western blot. As indicated in Fig. 3A, multiple SUMO-1-modified forms of p53 were detected in lysates from cells expressing S718A-Topors. By contrast, sumoylated forms of p53 were absent in WT-Topors-expressing or non-transfected U2OS cells, suggesting that Plk1-mediated phosphorylation of Topors inhibits its sumoylation activity toward p53. This is not due to a loading difference because sumoylated forms of p53 can be easily detected even with only 5% of the lysate from S718A-Topors-expressing cells (supplemental Fig. 5A). The increased level of p53 sumoylation in cells expressing S718A-Topors was also confirmed by anti-SUMO-1 Western blotting (supplemental Fig. 5B). To provide more evidence that Plk1 activity regulates sumoylation of p53, U2OS cells stably expressing Topors (WT or S718A) were co-transfected with YFP-SUMO-1 and pBS/U6-Plk1, the vector used to deplete Plk1 previously (3.Liu X. Erikson R.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2003; 100: 5789-5794Crossref PubMed Scopus (436) Google Scholar). When compared with cells with a normal Plk1 level, both untransfected cells and WT-Topors-expressing cells accumulated sumoylated forms of p53 upon Plk1 depletion (Fig. 3B). Based on these observations, we conclude that Plk1-mediated phosphorylation of Topors at Ser718 negatively regulates sumoylation of p53 in mammalian cells. In addition, we examined whether Plk1 phosphorylation of Topors also regulates the ubiquitination of p53. Accordingly, U2OS cells stably expressing Topors (WT or S718A) were transfected with His-ubiquitin and subjected to an anti-p53 IP followed by an anti-p53 Western blot. As shown in Fig. 3C and supplemental Fig. 5C, strong ubiquitin-modified forms of p53 were observed in both control and WT-Topors-expressing cells, whereas ubiquitinated forms p53 were absent in S718A-Topors-expressing cells. These results demonstrate that phosphorylation of Topors at Ser718 is required for ubiquitination of p53. Taken together, our data strongly support the notion that Plk1-mediated phosphorylation of Topors suppresses the sumoylation of p53, inducing instead p53 ubiquitination, which results in p53 degradation. Phosphorylation of Topors was reported in a screen for nuclear phosphorylated proteins in HeLa cells (21.Beausoleil S.A. Jedrychowski M. Schwartz D. Elias J.E. Villén J. Li J. Cohn M.A. Cantley L.C. Gygi S.P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2004; 101: 12130-12135Crossref PubMed Scopus (1239) Google Scholar). Recently, mass spectrometry was used to identify four Topors phosphorylation sites (22.Park H.J. Zheng H. Kulkarni D. Kerrigan J. Pungaliya P. Saleem A. Rubin E.H. Biochemistry. 2008; 47: 13887-13896Crossref PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar). Ser718 was not identified as a residue to be phosphorylated in this approach, likely due to an incomplete coverage of Topors fragments by enzymatic digestion of arginine/serine-rich regions (22.Park H.J. Zheng H. Kulkarni D. Kerrigan J. Pungaliya P. Saleem A. Rubin E.H. Biochemistry. 2008; 47: 13887-13896Crossref PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar). It is likely that multiple kinases act together to regulate Topors functions. In the case of Plk1, it has been established that a priming kinase phosphorylates the substrate to create a docking site for the C-terminal Polo box domain of Plk1 and that the recruited Plk1 phosphorylates the substrate to regulate its function (16.Wu Z.Q. Liu X. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2008; 105: 1919-1924Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar, 23.Elia A.E. Cantley L.C. Yaffe M.B. Science. 2003; 299: 1228-1231Crossref PubMed Scopus (577) Google Scholar). Being a part of a serine-proline dipeptide, Ser98 is a likely cyclin-dependent kinase site (24.Songyang Z. Blechner S. Hoagland N. Hoekstra M.F. Piwnica-Worms H. Cantley L.C. Curr. Biol. 1994; 4: 973-982Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (538) Google Scholar). Whether cyclin-dependent kinase serves as a priming kinase for Ser98 to regulate Plk1-mediated phosphorylation of Topors at Ser718 is a likely possibility. Although SUMO-1 is thought to be mono-conjugated to its substrate, a recent publication provides the first definite demonstration of the assembly of a poly-SUMO-1 chain on a protein substrate at a single SUMO-1 acceptor site (25.Yang M. Hsu C.T. Ting C.Y. Liu L.F. Hwang J. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 8264-8274Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). Therefore, it is possible that the multiple sumoylated p53 bands we observed in Fig. 3A are due to the formation of the poly-SUMO-1 chain on p53. Alternatively, because at least two sumoylation sites (Lys26 and Lys302) have been identified for Drosophila p53 (26.Mauri F. McNamee L.M. Lunardi A. Chiacchiera F. Del Sal G. Brodsky M.H. Collavin L. J. Biol. Chem. 2008; 283: 20848-20856Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar), additional sumoylation sites may also exist for human p53, in addition to the already established site Lys386 (27.Watson I.R. Irwin M.S. Neoplasia. 2006; 8: 655-666Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). Possible multiple sumoylation sites can also be a reason for the multiple bands we observed in Fig. 3A. The mechanism by which the Plk1 phosphorylation of Ser718 inhibits the sumoylation activity of Topors while enhancing the ubiquitination activity is currently unknown. Several possibilities exist, including affecting ubiquitin carrier protein (E2) enzyme interaction, substrate binding, cellular localization, or protein stability (22.Park H.J. Zheng H. Kulkarni D. Kerrigan J. Pungaliya P. Saleem A. Rubin E.H. Biochemistry. 2008; 47: 13887-13896Crossref PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar). These possibilities are currently under investigation. We thank Dr. R.

https://openalex.org/W1965100677,"Heme oxygenase (HO) catalyzes the rate-limiting step in heme catabolism to generate CO, biliverdin, and free iron. Two isoforms of HO have been identified in mammals: inducible HO-1 and constitutively expressed HO-2. HO-1 and HO-2 share similar physical and kinetic properties but have different physiological roles and tissue distributions. Unlike HO-1, which lacks cysteine residues, HO-2 contains three Cys-Pro signatures, known as heme regulatory motifs (HRMs), which are known to control processes related to iron and oxidative metabolism in organisms from bacteria to humans. In HO-2, the C-terminal HRMs constitute a thiol/disulfide redox switch that regulates affinity of the enzyme for heme (Yi, L., and Ragsdale, S. W. (2007) J. Biol. Chem. 282, 20156-21067). Here, we demonstrate that the thiol/disulfide switch in human HO-2 is physiologically relevant. Its redox potential was measured to be -200 mV, which is near the ambient intracellular redox potential. We expressed HO-2 in bacterial and human cells and measured the redox state of the C-terminal HRMs in growing cells by thiol-trapping experiments using the isotope-coded affinity tag technique. Under normal growth conditions, the HRMs are 60-70% reduced, whereas oxidative stress conditions convert most (86-89%) of the HRMs to the disulfide state. Treatment with reductants converts the HRMs largely (81-87%) to the reduced dithiol state. Thus, the thiol/disulfide switch in HO-2 responds to cellular oxidative stress and reductive conditions, representing a paradigm for how HRMs can integrate heme homeostasis with CO signaling and redox regulation of cellular metabolism."
https://openalex.org/W2007018052,"NMDA receptor subunit composition varies throughout the brain, providing molecular diversity in NMDA receptor function. The NR2 subunits (NR2A–D) in large part dictate the distinct functional properties of NMDA receptors and differentially regulate receptor trafficking. Although the NR2C subunit is highly enriched in cerebellar granule cells and plays a unique role in cerebellar function, little is known about NR2C-specific regulation of NMDA receptors. Here, we demonstrate that PKB/Akt directly phosphorylates NR2C on serine 1096 (S1096). In addition, we identify 14-3-3ɛ as an NR2C interactor, whose binding is dependent on S1096 phosphorylation. Both growth factor stimulation and NMDA receptor activity lead to a robust increase in both phosphorylation of NR2C on S1096 and surface expression of cerebellar NMDA receptors. Finally, we find that NR2C expression, unlike NR2A and NR2B, supports neuronal survival. Thus, our data provide a direct mechanistic link between growth factor stimulation and regulation of cerebellar NMDA receptors.

Thus, our data provide a direct mechanistic link between growth factor stimulation and regulation of cerebellar NMDA receptors. NMDA receptors are widely distributed in the CNS where they regulate neuronal development and synaptic plasticity. NMDA receptors are tetramers composed of homologous subunits (NR1, NR2A–D, NR3A–B), but their precise subunit composition varies at excitatory synapses throughout the brain and during development (Cull-Candy and Leszkiewicz, 2004Cull-Candy S.G. Leszkiewicz D.N. Role of distinct NMDA receptor subtypes at central synapses.Sci. STKE. 2004; 2004: re16Crossref PubMed Scopus (605) Google Scholar). Functional NMDA receptors require both NR1 and NR2 subunits; however, unlike NR1, there are multiple NR2 subunits, each with unique spatiotemporal expression patterns, ensuring molecular diversity in endogenous NMDA receptors. The NR2 subunit composition determines the functional properties of NMDA receptors as well as the coupling of NMDA receptors to distinct intracellular signaling pathways. Furthermore, at a given synapse, the subunit composition of NMDA receptors can change in response to experience and synaptic activity (Bellone and Nicoll, 2007Bellone C. Nicoll R.A. Rapid bidirectional switching of synaptic NMDA receptors.Neuron. 2007; 55: 779-785Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (254) Google Scholar). Ultimately, this precise regulation of NMDA receptor expression at excitatory synapses regulates synaptic function and plasticity of AMPA receptors. The trafficking of NMDA receptors is tightly regulated. There is evidence that NMDA receptor trafficking is governed by a variety of mechanisms that regulate distinct intracellular trafficking pathways including ER-retention/egress, exocytosis, lateral diffusion in the plasma membrane, and endocytosis followed by either degradation or recycling (Groc and Choquet, 2006Groc L.

Zukin R.S. NMDA receptor trafficking in synaptic plasticity and neuropsychiatric disorders.Nat. Rev. Neurosci. 2007; 8: 413-426Crossref PubMed Scopus (909) Google Scholar). The precise molecular mechanisms regulating NMDA receptor trafficking depend on motifs located within the intracellular C-termini of receptor subunits, often within the NR2 subunits (Lau and Zukin, 2007Lau C.G. Zukin R.S. NMDA receptor trafficking in synaptic plasticity and neuropsychiatric disorders.Nat. Rev. Neurosci. 2007; 8: 413-426Crossref PubMed Scopus (909) Google Scholar, Wenthold et al., 2003Wenthold R.J. Prybylowski K. Standley S. Sans N. Petralia R.S. Trafficking of NMDA receptors.Annu. Rev. Pharmacol. Toxicol. 2003; 43: 335-358Crossref PubMed Scopus (292) Google Scholar). Protein phosphorylation is also an important mechanism regulating NMDA receptor trafficking, as well as channel function. NMDA receptors are directly phosphorylated by a variety of protein kinases, and the substrate specificity is often subunit specific (Chen and Roche, 2007Chen B.S. Roche K.W. Regulation of NMDA receptors by phosphorylation.Neuropharmacology. 2007; 53: 362-368Crossref PubMed Scopus (305) Google Scholar). In cerebellar granule cells, the subunit composition of NMDA receptors changes dramatically during development (Akazawa et al., 1994Akazawa C. Shigemoto R. Bessho Y. Nakanishi S. Mizuno N. Differential expression of five N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor subunit mRNAs in the cerebellum of developing and adult rats.J. Comp.

Developmental and regional expression in the rat brain and functional properties of four NMDA receptors.Neuron. 1994; 12: 529-540Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2878) Google Scholar). NR2B is expressed early but almost disappears by postnatal day 21 (Akazawa et al., 1994Akazawa C. Shigemoto R. Bessho Y. Nakanishi S. Mizuno N. Differential expression of five N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor subunit mRNAs in the cerebellum of developing and adult rats.J. Comp. Neurol. 1994; 347: 150-160Crossref PubMed Scopus (385) Google Scholar). In contrast, NR2A and NR2C are not expressed early in development but replace NR2B in mature neurons. In contrast to NR2A and NR2B, which are highly expressed in many regions of the forebrain, NR2C is specifically enriched in cerebellar granule cells, suggesting a unique role for this subunit in the regulation of cerebellar neurons. NR2C-containing NMDA receptors have distinct characteristics including a reduced sensitivity to magnesium and a smaller conductance compared to NR2A- or NR2B-containing NMDA receptors (Cull-Candy and Leszkiewicz, 2004Cull-Candy S.G. Leszkiewicz D.N. Role of distinct NMDA receptor subtypes at central synapses.Sci. STKE. 2004; 2004: re16Crossref PubMed Scopus (605) Google Scholar). In addition, mice expressing NR2C and NR2A with deleted C-terminal domains have impaired cerebellar synaptic plasticity (Rossi et al., 2002Rossi P. Sola E. Taglietti V. Borchardt T. Steigerwald F. Utvik J.K. Ottersen O.P. Kohr G. D'Angelo E. NMDA receptor 2 (NR2) C-terminal control of NR open probability regulates synaptic transmission and plasticity at a cerebellar synapse.J. Neurosci. 2002; 22: 9687-9697Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), and mice lacking NR2C display impaired motor coordination (Sprengel et al., 1998Sprengel R. Suchanek B. Amico C. Brusa R. Burnashev N. Rozov A. Hvalby O. Jensen V. Paulsen O. Andersen P. et al.Importance of the intracellular domain of NR2 subunits for NMDA receptor function in vivo.Cell. 1998; 92: 279-289Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (379) Google Scholar), demonstrating a critical role for NR2C in cerebellar function. However, there has been little characterization of NR2C-specific regulation of glutamate receptor trafficking. Cerebellar granule cells require growth factor signaling to survive during development (Contestabile, 2002Contestabile A. Cerebellar granule cells as a model to study mechanisms of neuronal apoptosis or survival in vivo and in vitro.Cerebellum. 2002; 1: 41-55Crossref PubMed Scopus (176) Google Scholar). Insulin-like growth factor-1 (IGF-1), in particular, is essential to inhibit apoptosis (Blair et al., 1999Blair L.A. Bence-Hanulec K.K. Mehta S. Franke T. Kaplan D. Marshall J. Akt-dependent potentiation of L channels by insulin-like growth factor-1 is required for neuronal survival.J. Neurosci. 1999; 19: 1940-1951Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, Dudek et al., 1997Dudek H.

IGF-1 upregulates PI3K and stimulates protein kinase B (PKB)/Akt, which phosphorylates many cellular substrates (Brazil et al., 2004Brazil D.P. Yang Z.Z.

Neurochem. 2002; 82: 1097-1105Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar), there are no reports of PKB directly phosphorylating any subtype of glutamate receptor. In the current study, we now show that PKB phosphorylates NR2C on S1096, thus regulating NMDA receptor trafficking by promoting the association of 14-3-3ɛ with NR1/NR2C heteromeric receptors. Growth factor stimulation or receptor activity trigger PKB-dependent trafficking of cerebellar NMDA receptors to the cell surface. Furthermore, NR2C expression, unlike NR2A or NR2B, protects cerebellar granule cells in an NMDA toxicity assay. Thus, our findings provide a novel link between growth factor stimulation, NMDA receptor phosphorylation and trafficking, and neuronal survival. To identify NR2C interacting proteins, we screened a rat brain yeast two-hybrid library with the NR2C C terminus (aa 1076–aa 1250; Figure 1A), and isolated 14-3-3ɛ (see Figure S1 available online). The mammalian 14-3-3 proteins consist of seven highly homologous members that interact with a variety of proteins, regulating signal transduction and protein trafficking. The 14-3-3 family of proteins were originally isolated as abundant proteins in the brain and are highly conserved in a broad range of eukaryotic organisms. To characterize the specificity of the NR2C-14-3-3ɛ interaction, we evaluated the binding of 14-3-3ɛ to the C terminus of NR2A, NR2B, or NR2C using yeast two-hybrid direct interaction assays. By evaluating growth on histidine-deficient plates (−His) as an assay for protein-protein interactions, we observed no specific binding when the C terminus of NR2A or NR2B was coexpressed with 14-3-3ɛ (Figure S1). In contrast, NR2C interacted strongly with 14-3-3ɛ, demonstrating that the interaction between 14-3-3ɛ and NMDA receptors is specific for the NR2C subunit. Upon sequence examination, we found two regions (1093-R-H-A-S-L-P-1098 and 1141-R-L-P-S-Y-P-1146) within the NR2C C terminus that are similar to previously identified 14-3-3 binding motifs, R-S-X-SP-X-P and R-X-X-X-SP-X-P (X can be any amino acid and SP indicates a phosphorylated serine; Yaffe et al., 1997Yaffe M.B. Rittinger K. Volinia S. Caron P.R. Aitken A. Leffers H. Gamblin S.J. Smerdon S.J. Cantley L.C. The structural basis for 14–3-3:phosphopeptide binding specificity.Cell. 1997; 91: 961-971Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1347) Google Scholar). To determine whether these two regions of NR2C are required for 14-3-3ɛ binding, we tested the interaction of 14-3-3ɛ with NR2C containing a mutation in the critical serine residue within each putative binding site, S1096A (Figure 1A) or S1144A. The NR2C S1096A mutation disrupted the 14-3-3ɛ binding, whereas NR2C S1144A mutant had no effect (Figure 1B), indicating that S1096 is part of the 14-3-3ɛ binding motif on NR2C. We also examined 14-3-3ɛ binding to NR2C using a coimmunoprecipitation assay in HEK293 cells expressing FLAG-NR2C or FLAG-NR2C S1096A and Myc-14-3-3ɛ. Surprisingly, Myc-14-3-3ɛ was not coimmunoprecipitated efficiently with NR2C (Figure 1C). Because NR2 subunits are ER-retained in the absence of NR1, we reasoned that perhaps the correct assembly of NR2C with NR1 is required for the 14-3-3 interactions. Indeed, there is evidence that 14-3-3 family members preferentially bind to assembled proteins in the ER-Golgi intermediate compartment thus facilitating export of properly assembled multimers from the ER (O'Kelly et al., 2002O'Kelly I. Butler M.H. Zilberberg N. Goldstein S.A.

Consistent with this hypothesis, we observed robust binding of 14-3-3 to NR2C only upon co-transfection with NR1. Furthermore, the NR2C S1096A mutation disrupted the NR2C-14-3-3ɛ interaction (Figure 1C). These results not only provided evidence that the R-H-A-S-L-P (S1096) motif of NR2C is responsible for 14-3-3 binding but also show that 14-3-3ɛ specifically binds NR1/NR2C heteromers. To investigate the interaction between NR2C and 14-3-3ɛ in neurons, 14-3-3ɛ was immunoprecipitated from cerebellum homogenate and immunoblotted with an NR2C antibody, which also cross-reacted with NR2A and NR2B. Consistent with the results from yeast two-hybrid interaction assay, we found that NR2C, but not NR2A and NR2B, coimmunoprecipitated with 14-3-3ɛ (Figure 1D), demonstrating that NR2C is a specific binding partner for 14-3-3ɛ in vivo. NMDA receptors are dynamically regulated by protein phosphorylation, and many sites have been identified on the C-termini of NR2 subunits (Chen and Roche, 2007Chen B.S. Roche K.W. Regulation of NMDA receptors by phosphorylation.Neuropharmacology. 2007; 53: 362-368Crossref PubMed Scopus (305) Google Scholar). Because 14-3-3 proteins typically bind to phosphorylated serine residues (Yaffe et al., 1997Yaffe M.B. Rittinger K. Volinia S. Caron P.R. Aitken A. Leffers H. Gamblin S.J. Smerdon S.J. Cantley L.C. The structural basis for 14–3-3:phosphopeptide binding specificity.Cell. 1997; 91: 961-971Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1347) Google Scholar) and S1096 on NR2C is required for 14-3-3 binding, we investigated whether S1096 on NR2C is phosphorylated. Interestingly, sequence examination revealed a prototypical PKB consensus motif surrounding S1096 in the NR2C intracellular C terminus, which coincides with the 14-3-3 binding motif (Figure 1A). Although the serine is conserved in other NR2 subunits, the entire PKB recognition motif is not (Figure 1A). We performed in vitro phosphorylation assays using GST fusion proteins (GST, GST-NR2C wild-type (WT) or GST-NR2C S1096A) incubated with recombinant PKB. The equal loading of GST-NR2C fusion proteins was confirmed by Coomassie blue staining (data not shown). GST-NR2C WT and GST-NR2C S1244A were efficiently phosphorylated by PKB in vitro (Figure S2A), but reduced phosphorylation was observed for GST-NR2C S1096A (Figure S2A), demonstrating the direct phosphorylation of S1096 by PKB in vitro. The residual phosphorylation of GST-NR2C S1096A indicates that there is a second site on NR2C that PKB phosphorylates in vitro, although less efficiently than S1096. We next raised a phosphorylation state-specific polyclonal antibody recognizing phosphorylated S1096 that specifically detected PKB phosphorylated GST-NR2C fusion protein (Figure S2B). In contrast, the antibody did not recognize GST-NR2C S1096A even when the fusion protein was incubated with PKB (Figure S2B), demonstrating the direct phosphorylation of S1096 by PKB in vitro and confirming the specificity of the antibody for NR2C phosphorylated on S1096. To test if NR2C S1096 is phosphorylated upon PKB activation in situ, we coexpressed NR2C with a constitutively active form of PKB (caPKB; Cong et al., 1997Cong L.N. Chen H. Li Y. Zhou L. McGibbon M.A. Taylor S.I. Quon M.J. Physiological role of Akt in insulin-stimulated translocation of GLUT4 in transfected rat adipose cells.Mol. Endocrinol. 1997; 11: 1881-1890Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) in HEK293 cells. Coexpression of NR2C with either caPKB or a dominant-negative form of PKB (dnPKB) in HEK293 cells did not affect NR2C expression (Figure 2A). The phosphorylation of S1096 increased dramatically upon cotransfection with caPKB, but no increase was observed for NR2C S1096A or for NR2C WT or NR2C S1096A coexpressed with dnPKB (Figure 2A). Similar results were obtained when NR1 was co-transfected with NR2C and caPKB or dnPKB (Figure S3A). Various growth factors stimulate the phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K) signal transduction cascade, which results in the activation of PKB (Datta et al., 1999Datta S.R. Brunet A. Greenberg M.E. Cellular survival: a play in three Akts.Genes Dev. 1999; 13: 2905-2927Crossref PubMed Scopus (3720) Google Scholar). Because HEK293 cells are insulin sensitive, we investigated whether IGF-1 treatment, which activates PKB via PI3K, would stimulate NR2C phosphorylation on S1096. We observed a marked increase in NR2C S1096 phosphorylation in response to PKB activation that was blocked by incubation with the PI3K inhibitor wortmannin to prevent activation of the PI3K-PKB pathway (Figure 2B). Taken together, these results demonstrate that IGF-1, through the activation of PI3K/PKB pathway, is able to induce NR2C S1096 phosphorylation. Similar results were obtained when NR2C was co-transfected with NR1 (Figure S3B). To evaluate the phosphorylation of endogenous NR2C, we analyzed NR2C isolated from mouse cerebellum slices (prepared from P12 animals). Immunoblots probed with the NR2C S1096 phosphorylation state-specific antibody revealed that endogenous NR2C was phosphorylated on S1096 (Figure 2C). Furthermore, treatment of the membrane with lambda-phosphatase prior to immunoblotting eliminated the NR2C band recognized with the S1096 phosphorylation state-specific antibody (Figure 2C), confirming that the immunoreactivity was specific for phosphorylated NR2C. NR2C is expressed at a very low level in hippocampus compared to cerebellum, accordingly in hippocampus we observed only a low level of NR2C expression (Figure 2C). To investigate if S1096 phosphorylation on endogenous NR2C is dynamically regulated in neurons, we treated cultured cerebellar granule cells (12 days in vitro) with IGF-1 for various periods of time to stimulate PKB activity. Immunoblot analysis with the NR2C S1096 phosphorylation state-specific antibody revealed that NR2C S1096 is phosphorylated even in the absence of IGF-1, indicating that there is a modest basal level of phosphorylation in cerebellar granule cells. However, IGF-1 treatment resulted in a dramatic increase in phosphorylation of NR2C S1096 (Figure 2D), showing that endogenous NR2C S1096 is regulated by PKB in vivo. NMDA receptor activation has been shown to stimulate PKB activity (Lafon-Cazal et al., 2002Lafon-Cazal M. Perez V. Bockaert J. Marin P. Akt mediates the anti-apoptotic effect of NMDA but not that induced by potassium depolarization in cultured cerebellar granule cells.Eur. J. Neurosci. 2002; 16: 575-583Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar); therefore, we examined if agonist exposure regulates phosphorylation of NR2C S1096 and found that brief NMDA treatment transiently increased phosphorylation of NR2C S1096 (Figure 2E). In contrast, application of the NMDA receptor antagonist APV decreased NR2C S1096 phosphorylation over the same time course (Figure 2F), revealing a tonic stimulation of NR2C S1096 phosphorylation by endogenous glutamate. These results demonstrate that both IGF-1 and NMDA receptor activity regulate phosphorylation of NR2C on S1096 in cerebellar granule cells. Phosphorylation of ionotropic glutamate receptors is an important mechanism modulating receptor trafficking (Lee, 2006Lee H.K. Synaptic plasticity and phosphorylation.Pharmacol. Ther. 2006; 112: 810-832Crossref PubMed Scopus (165) Google Scholar). We therefore examined if PKB phosphorylation of NR2C affects surface expression of NR2C-containing NMDA receptors using fluorescence activated cell sorting (FACS) analysis. A bicistronic expression construct containing the coding sequence of FLAG-tagged NR2C and EGFP was used to monitor NR2C-transfected cells (GFP-positive cells), and a second bicistronic expression construct containing the coding sequence of NR1-1a and DsRed was used to monitor NR1-1a-transfected cells (DsRed-positive cells). Surface expression of FLAG-NR2C in live HEK293 cells expressing both GFP and DsRed was measured. We found that caPKB dramatically increased wild-type NR2C surface expression, whereas expression of caPKB resulted in only a modest increase in the surface expression of NR2C S1096A (Figure 3A), demonstrating that S1096 primarily mediates the PKB-dependent increase in NMDA receptor surface expression. We also measured the effects of PKB on surface expression of NR2C/NR1 heteromers in HEK293 cells using a cell surface biotinylation assay. We found that IGF-1 treatment robustly increased surface expression of NR2C WT with only a modest effect on NR2C S1096A (Figure 3B). α-Tubulin, an intracellular protein, was used as a negative control for surface biotinylation. To determine whether surface expression of endogenous NR2C is regulated by PKB phosphorylation in neurons, we treated cultured cerebellar granule cells with IGF-1 and performed a cell surface biotinylation assay. IGF-1 treatment dramatically increased surface expression of NR2C in cerebellar granule cells (Figure 3C), and the increase was blocked by pre-incubation with the PI3K inhibitor wortmannin or LY294002 prior to IGF-1 treatment (Figures S4A and S4C). We also treated cultured cerebellar granule cells with NMDA and evaluated receptor surface expression using the cell surface biotinylation assay. Interestingly, NMDA treatment also dramatically upregulated surface expression of endogenous NR2C (Figure 3D), which can be blocked by preincubation with wortmannin or LY294002 (Figures S4B and S4C). Taken together, these data demonstrate that PKB phosphorylation of NR2C S1096 driven by IGF-1 signaling or NMDA receptor activation facilitates NR2C trafficking to the plasma membrane. The biotinylation results indicated that PKB phosphorylation of NR2C is required for receptor trafficking in neurons, but these experiments did not specifically address the role of 14-3-3ɛ in regulating surface expression of NR2C. To determine whether 14-3-3ɛ binding to NR2C is necessary for NR2C trafficking, we used a dominant-negative form of 14-3-3ɛ (14-3-3ɛ dn) to functionally deplete 14-3-3ɛ in neurons (Czirjak et al., 2008Czirjak G. Vuity D. Enyedi P. Phosphorylation-dependent binding of 14–3-3 proteins controls TRESK regulation.J. Biol. Chem. 2008; 283: 15672-15680Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar, Thorson et al., 1998Thorson J.A. Yu L.W. Hsu A.L. Shih N.Y. Graves P.R. Tanner J.W. Allen P.M. Piwnica-Worms H. Shaw A.S. 14–3-3 proteins are required for maintenance of Raf-1 phosphorylation and kinase activity.Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 5229-5238Crossref PubMed Scopus (184) Google Scholar). We made a GFP-NR2C construct, which contains a GFP tag in the extracellular N-terminal domain of the receptor, to specifically label surface-expressed receptors. Cerebellar granule cells were co-transfected with GFP-NR2C WT or GFP-NR2C S1096A and Myc-14-3-3ɛ or Myc-14-3-3ɛ dn. We labeled the surface-expressed receptors with anti-GFP antibody. Surface expression of NR2C WT was dramatically decreased upon cotransfection with 14-3-3ɛ dn (Figure 4), indicating that the interaction between NR2C and 14-3-3 is required for NR2C trafficking. In addition, surface expression of NR2C S1096A was much less than that of NR2C WT when 14-3-3ɛ was coexpressed and was further reduced upon coexpression with 14-3-3ɛ dn (Figure 4), suggesting that S1096 is not the sole molecular determinant in 14-3-3ɛ-regulated NR2C trafficking. Because IGF-1 has been shown to promote neuronal survival by activating PKB and increased surface expression of NR2C was driven by the same signaling pathway, we investigated whether NR2C is involved in neuronal survival. Cultured cerebellar granule cells were co-transfected with vector, GFP-NR2A, GFP-NR2B or GFP-NR2C and DsRed. At 6 DIV, the neurons were incubated with NMDA to induce excitotoxicity (Bonfoco et al., 1995Bonfoco E. Krainc D. Ankarcrona M. Nicotera P. Lipton S.A. Apoptosis and necrosis: two distinct events induced, respectively, by mild and intense insults with N-methyl-D-aspartate or nitric oxide/superoxide in cortical cell cultures.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 1995; 92: 7162-7166Crossref PubMed Scopus (1863) Google Scholar). To closely monitor the effect of NMDA treatment, we used time-lapse microscopy of DsRed-labeled neurons. We found that neurons overexpressing NR2A or NR2B developed cell body swelling and dendritic varicosities within 5 min following NMDA treatment (Figure 5A and Movie S1). Neurons expressing DsRed alone also showed swelling of the cell body and localized dendritic varicosities, although not as rapidly as neurons expressing NR2A or NR2B. In sharp contrast, NR2C expressing neurons were protected from the NMDA-induced toxicity (Figure 5A and Movie S1). To determine if PKB-dependent trafficking of NR2C played a role in cell survival, we evaluated toxicity in cerebellar granule cells expressing NR2C WT or NR2C S1096A and found no difference in cell survival upon acute NMDA treatment (data not shown). However, we analyzed older cultures (DIV8) and found that neurons expressing NR2C S1096A displayed increased dendritic fragmentation and varicosities compared to NR2C WT, indicating neuronal injury (Hasbani et al., 2001Hasbani M.J. Schlief M.L. Fisher D.A. Goldberg M.P. Dendritic spines lost during glutamate receptor activation reemerge at original sites of synaptic contact.J. Neurosci. 2001; 21: 2393-2403Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Quantitation revealed that cerebellar granule cells expressing NR2C S1096A showed almost double the number of neurons with dendritic varicosities compared to NR2C WT-expressing cells (Figure 5B). This is consistent with NR2C surface expression, and specifically S1096, playing an important role in regulating cell survival. In this study, we have revealed a growth factor-dependent pathway for the subunit-specific regulation of cerebellar NMDA receptors. We demonstrate that NR2C specifically interacts with 14-3-3ɛ, that phosphorylation of S1096 on NR2C regulates NMDA receptor binding to 14-3-3, and that S1096 is phosphorylated by PKB. Furthermore, growth factor stimulation or NMDA receptor activation increases NR2C S1096 phosphorylation and surface expression of NMDA receptors in cerebellar granule cells. These data are all consistent with a model in which NR1 and NR2C oligomerize, PKB phosphorylates S1096, and 14-3-3ɛ binds to phosphorylated NR2C thereby promoting NR2C-containing NMDA receptor surface expression in cerebellar granule cells. Our findings therefore provide a direct link between growth factor signaling, which is essential for cerebellar granule cell survival, and NMDA receptor surface expression. Our finding that the serine/threonine kinase PKB specifically phosphorylates NR2C expands the list of kinases regulating endogenous NMDA receptors and adds to the subunit-specific complexity of NMDA receptor regulation. PKB has been studied extensively vis a vis its role in cell cycle progression, apoptosis, and cell signaling. In addition, PKB phosphorylation of many distinct substrates can regulate protein-protein interactions and protein trafficking (Brazil et al., 2004Brazil D.P. Yang Z.Z. Hemmings B.A. Advances in protein kinase B signalling: AKTion on multiple fronts.Trends Biochem. Sci. 2004; 29: 233-242Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (722) Google Scholar). We now show that such a mechanism regulates NMDA receptor trafficking in the cerebellum. Interestingly, NR2C S1096 is conserved in NR2A (S1291) and NR2B (S1303), with the analogous serines being substrates for PKC and/or CaMKII (Jones and Leonard, 2005Jones M.L. Leonard J.P.

https://openalex.org/W2092395399,"We have previously reported that growth factor receptor-bound protein-7 (Grb7), an Src-homology 2 (SH2)-containing adaptor protein, enables interaction with focal adhesion kinase (FAK) to regulate cell migration in response to integrin activation. To further elucidate the signaling events mediated by FAK*Grb7 complexes in promoting cell migration and other cellular functions, we firstly examined the phosphorylated tyrosine site(s) of Grb7 by FAK using an in vivo mutagenesis. We found that FAK was capable of phosphorylating at least 2 of 12 tyrosine residues within Grb7, Tyr-188 and Tyr-338. Moreover, mutations converting the identified Tyr to Phe inhibited integrin-dependent cell migration as well as impaired cell proliferation but not survival compared with the wild-type control. Interestingly, the above inhibitory effects caused by the tyrosine phosphorylation-deficient mutants are probably attributed to their down-regulation of phospho-Tyr-397 of FAK, thereby implying a mechanism by competing with wild-type Grb7 for binding to FAK. Consequently, these tyrosine phosphorylation-deficient mutants evidently altered the phospho-Tyr-118 of paxillin and phosphorylation of ERK1/2 but less on phospho-Ser-473 of AKT, implying their involvement in the FAK*Grb7-mediated cellular functions. Additionally, we also illustrated that the formation of FAK*Grb7 complexes and Grb7 phosphorylation by FAK in an integrin-dependent manner were essential for cell migration, proliferation and anchorage-independent growth in A431 epidermal carcinoma cells, indicating the importance of FAK*Grb7 complexes in tumorigenesis. Our data provide a better understanding on the signal transduction event for FAK*Grb7-mediated cellular functions as well as to shed light on a potential therapeutic in cancers."
https://openalex.org/W2090006482,"Blood-retinal barrier (BRB) breakdown is a key event in diabetic retinopathy and other ocular disorders that leads to increased retinal vascular permeability. This causes edema and tissue damage resulting in visual impairment. Insulin-like growth factor-I (IGF-I) is involved in these processes, although the relative contribution of increased systemic versus intraocular IGF-I remains controversial. Here, to elucidate the role of this factor in BRB breakdown, transgenic mice with either local or systemic elevations of IGF-I have been examined. High intraocular IGF-I, resulting from overexpression of IGF-I in the retina, increased IGF-I receptor content and signaling and led to accumulation of vascular endothelial growth factor. This was parallel to up-regulation of vascular Intercellular adhesion molecule I and retinal infiltration by bone marrow-derived microglial cells. These alterations resulted in increased vessel paracellular permeability to both low and high molecular weight compounds in IGF-I-overexpressing retinas and agreed with the loss of vascular tight junction integrity observed by electron microscopy and the altered junctional protein content. In contrast, mice with chronically elevated serum IGF-I did not show alterations in the retinal vasculature structure and permeability, indicating that circulating IGF-I cannot initiate BRB breakdown. Consistent with a key role of IGF-I signaling in retinal diseases, a strong up-regulation of the IGF-I receptor in human retinas with marked gliosis was also observed. Thus, this study demonstrates that intraocular IGF-I, but not systemic IGF-I, is sufficient to trigger processes leading to BRB breakdown and increased retinal vascular permeability. Therefore, therapeutic interventions designed to counteract local IGF-I effects may prove successful to prevent BRB disruption."

Another early event is the release of metabolites of arachidonic acid (e.g. prostaglandin D2 (PGD2) and leukotriene C4 (LTC4)). These eicosanoids cross the plasma membrane using transmembrane transporters (8.Loe D.W. Almquist K.C. Deeley R.G. Cole S.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 9675-9682Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (545) Google Scholar), and their production is regulated by the activation of their synthetic enzymes (9.Wong A. Cook M.N. Foley J.J. Sarau H.M. Marshall P. Hwang S.M. Biochemistry. 1991; 30: 9346-9354Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). A late response after MC activation is the secretion of cytokines and growth factors (e.g. tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α) and interleukin-4 (IL-4)). The gap in time of minutes to hours between stimulation and the secretion of these mediators is explained by the fact that regulation is at the transcriptional and post-transcriptional levels, with secretion occurring via constitutive exocytosis (10.Theoharides T.C. Kempuraj D. Tagen M. Conti P. Kalogeromitros D. Immunol. Rev. 2007; 217: 65-78Crossref PubMed Scopus (339) Google Scholar). mast cell bone marrow-derived MC cytoplasmic Ca2+ concentration plasma membrane capacitance change 2,4-dinitrophenol electron microscopy α-subunit of the high affinity receptor for IgE fluorescein isothiocyanate human serum albumin immunoglobulin E interleukin leukotriene C4 N-ethylmaleimide-sensitive fusion protein postnatal day 16 passive cutaneous anaphylaxis prostaglandin D2 stem cell factor synaptosome-associated protein of 25 kDa soluble NSF adaptor protein receptor Synaptotagmin tumor necrosis factor α vesicle-associated membrane protein MC-deficient B6.Cg-KitW-sh/KitW-sh mouse guanosine 5′-3-O-(thio)triphosphate. A common intracellular mediator linking the stimulation event to these three MC responses is calcium (Ca2+) that is released into the cytoplasm from intracellular stores and introduced from the extracellular environment via specialized channels. Increase in the cytoplasmic concentration of Ca2+ ([Ca2+]i) is required for the activation of phospholipase A2 and other enzymes in the synthetic pathway of prostaglandins and leukotrienes, for the expression of cytokines and growth factors, and for the regulated exocytosis of MC secretory granules (11.Turner H. Kinet J.P. Nature. 1999; 402: B24-B30Crossref PubMed Scopus (621) Google Scholar). MC degranulation is a highly regulated process, and, like other exocytic events, it requires the participation of soluble NSF (N-ethylmaleimide-sensitive fusion protein) adaptor protein receptor (SNARE) proteins. These are present both on the cytoplasmic surfaces of secretory vesicles (v-SNAREs such as vesicle-associated membrane protein, VAMP) and of the plasma membrane (target or t-SNAREs such as Syntaxin and synaptosome-associated protein of 25 kDa, SNAP-25). Cognate v- and t-SNAREs form a highly stable quadruple α-helix complex (core complex) apposing the vesicle and target membranes. According to the “zipper hypothesis” the coiling of this complex drives the fusion between these membranes, opening a fusion pore and releasing the vesicle contents into the extracellular space (12.Jahn R. Lang T. Südhof T.C. Cell. 2003; 112: 519-533Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1230) Google Scholar). This step is Ca2+-dependent and is under the control of multiple proteins such as Synaptotagmin (Syt) (13.Chapman E.R. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2008; 77: 615-641Crossref PubMed Scopus (422) Google Scholar). There are at least 15 Syts in mammals, and several of them mediate Ca2+-dependent exocytosis. All Syts have a short intravesicular N terminus, a transmembrane domain, a variable linker region, and two conserved C2 domains (C2A and C2B) at their C terminus. The binding of Ca2+ to the C2 domains alters their electrostatic surface charge and mediates most of the Ca2+-dependent functions of Syt (13.Chapman E.R. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2008; 77: 615-641Crossref PubMed Scopus (422) Google Scholar). The C2A domains of Syt1, -2, and -9 bind Ca2+ with low affinity and high cooperativity. These Syts were first identified in neurons where they control fast, synchronous, Ca2+-dependent synaptic vesicle exocytosis. Syt1 mediates this form of exocytosis in forebrain neurons (14.Geppert M. Goda Y. Hammer R.E. Li C. Rosahl T.W. Stevens C.F. Südhof T.C. Cell. 1994; 79: 717-727Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1217) Google Scholar) and Syt9 in limbic and striatal neurons (15.Xu J. Mashimo T. Südhof T.C. Neuron. 2007; 54: 567-581Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (245) Google Scholar). Both of them also mediate rapid exocytosis of dense core granules in adrenal chromaffin cells. We showed that Syt2 functions as the Ca2+ sensor for fast synchronous synaptic vesicle release in hindbrain neurons and at the neuromuscular junction and that deletion of Syt2 produces a severe neurologic phenotype that results in death during the third week of postnatal life (16.Sun J. Pang Z.P. Qin D. Fahim A.T. Adachi R. Südhof T.C. Nature. 2007; 450: 676-682Crossref PubMed Scopus (270) Google Scholar, 17.Pang Z.P. Melicoff E. Padgett D. Liu Y. Teich A.F. Dickey B.F. Lin W. Adachi R. Südhof T.C. J. Neurosci. 2006; 26: 13493-13504Crossref PubMed Scopus (167) Google Scholar). These low Ca2+ affinity Syts also inhibit spontaneous and slow asynchronous vesicle exocytosis in the neurons where they are expressed (14.Geppert M. Goda Y. Hammer R.E. Li C. Rosahl T.W.

Tuvim M. Dickey B.F. Mekori Y.A. Sagi-Eisenberg R. J. Exp. Med. 1999; 189: 1649-1658Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar). Here we study the effects of Syt2 deficiency in MC secretion in vivo. We show that Syt2-null mice contain normal MCs in number and morphology in their peritoneal cavity and skin and that MCs can be generated from the bone marrow of these mutant mice. Although no defects were found in IgE-dependent generation and secretion of cytokines and eicosanoids, the MCs in our Syt2-null mice had a marked deficiency in the exocytosis of their preformed granule mediators. MC-deficient and Syt2 knock-out mice have been described (17.Pang Z.P. Melicoff E. Padgett D. Liu Y. Teich A.F. Dickey B.F. Lin W. Adachi R. Südhof T.C. J.

We produced all experimental animals and littermate controls by heterozygous crossings of a Syt2+/− line that we backcrossed 13 times into C57BL/6. We harvested and purified peritoneal MCs as described (4.Thakurdas S.M. Melicoff E. Sansores-Garcia L. Moreira D.C. Petrova Y. Stevens R.L. Adachi R. J. Biol. Chem. 2007; 282: 20809-20815Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar). We harvested bone marrow from femurs of postnatal day 16 (P16) mice to generate bone marrow-derived MCs (BMMCs). Cells were grown in RPMI 1640 (with 1% fetal calf serum, 100 μm Hepes buffer pH 7.3, 1 mm sodium pyruvate, 1× nonessential amino acids, and 0.1% β-mercaptoethanol) supplemented with mIL-3 5 ng/ml and stem cell factor (SCF) 100 ng/ml for 6 weeks. We followed the viability of BMMCs by Trypan Blue exclusion, and their maturation and differentiation by flow cytometry using labeled antibodies against the α-subunit of the high affinity receptor for IgE (FcϵRIα; eBioscience) and cKit/CD117 (BD Pharmingen). Cytospins of peritoneal MCs were postfixed with cold acetone, blocked with 3% bovine serum albumin/0.4% Triton X-100, incubated first with rabbit anti-Syt2 antibody 1:500 (A320; Dr. T. C. Südhof, Stanford University School of Medicine, Stanford, CA) (17.Pang Z.P. Melicoff E. Padgett D. Liu Y. Teich A.F. Dickey B.F. Lin W. Adachi R. Südhof T.C. J.

We used the same antibody for the immunoblotting of peritoneal MC lysates resolved by SDS-PAGE and transferred to nitrocellulose membranes. GAPDH (glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase), detected with a specific antibody (Abcam), was used as a loading control. We harvested and processed tissues, peritoneal lavage, and electron microscopy (EM) samples from P16 mice as described (4.Thakurdas S.M. Melicoff E. Sansores-Garcia L. Moreira D.C. Petrova Y. Stevens R.L. Adachi R. J. Biol. Chem. 2007; 282: 20809-20815Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar). In tissue sections, we stained MC secretory granules with fluorescein isothiocyanate (FITC)-avidin and nuclei with Hoechst (Invitrogen-Molecular Probes), and then counted nucleated MC profiles (FITC+/Hoechst+) in randomized sections. In ears, we used the autofluorescence of cartilage, epidermis, and muscle in the red channel to calculate the dermis area by subtracting the cartilage and muscle areas from the area between the two epidermal edges. We counted peritoneal MCs using a Neubauer chamber and cytospins (Wright-Giemsa). We obtained EM pictures of BMMCs and peritoneal MCs using an unbiased random sampling technique. We calculated the volume fraction and the surface density of the granules using the point counting method with a cycloid grid, and the profile area using a point grid (20.Peterson D.A. Methods. 1999; 18: 493-507Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). For each experiment, we suspended 106 BMMCs in 1 ml of culture medium and sensitized them with anti-2,4-dinitrophenol (DNP) IgE 5 μg/ml for 3 h. After repeated washes, we stimulated them with 100 ng/ml of DNP-human serum albumin (DNP-HSA). We measured all products in supernatants before and after stimulation. We also measured β-hexosaminidase in cell lysates (106 BMMCs treated with 1 ml of 0.2% Triton X-100). After stimulation, we measured LTC4 and PGD2 at 30 min, β-hexosaminidase and histamine at 1 h, TNF-α at 6 h, and IL-4 at different time points. We used enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays (ELISA, Oxford Biomed Res) to measure all products except β-hexosaminidase activity, which was measured by colorimetry using as substrate 4-nitrophenyl N-acetyl-β-d-glucosaminide. We used BMMCs derived from Syt2+/+ or Syt2−/− P16 mice for reconstitution of both ears of MC-deficient B6.Cg-KitW-sh/KitW-sh (Wsh/Wsh) mice. After 6 weeks in culture, 105 BMMCs were suspended in 25 μl of PBS and injected intradermally into each ear pinna. Six weeks later, we quantified the MCs in the ears of some animals by histology and then performed the PCA sensitization and challenge on the rest as described (4.Thakurdas S.M. Melicoff E.

Peritoneal MCs from P16 mice were sensitized with 3 μg/ml of anti-DNP IgE for 2 h, plated onto coverslips and incubated in 5 μm Fura 2-AM. Intracellular calcium of each individual MC was ratiometrically calculated (21.Zhou Z.Y. Wan Q.F. Thakur P. Heidelberger R. J. Neurophysiol. 2006; 96: 2539-2548Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar, 22.Heidelberger R. Matthews G. J. Physiol. 1992; 447: 235-256Crossref PubMed Scopus (193) Google Scholar). The fluorescence of an unstimulated MC was measured for 60 s prior to the addition of DNP-HSA to a final concentration of 0.5 μg/ml. Whole cell capacitance measurements of individual peritoneal MCs were made at room temperature using 5 to 6 mΩ sylgard-coated patch pipettes (21.Zhou Z.Y. Wan Q.F. Thakur P. Heidelberger R. J. Neurophysiol. 2006; 96: 2539-2548Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). The intracellular recording solution both defined the [Ca2+]i and stimulated exocytosis (23.Riedel D. Antonin W.

The external recording solution contained (mm) 140 NaCl, 2.5 KCl, 2 CaCl2, 1 MgCl2, 10 glucose, 10 HEPES (pH 7.2 and 310 mOsm). In previous studies, we showed that Syt2 is the main Syt isoform expressed in the RBL-2H3 MC line (18.Baram D. Adachi R. Medalia O. Tuvim M. Dickey B.F. Mekori Y.A. Sagi-Eisenberg R. J. Exp. Med. 1999; 189: 1649-1658Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar). Neurons from Syt2−/− mice have severe impairments in Ca2+-dependent-regulated exocytosis (16.Sun J. Pang Z.P. Qin D. Fahim A.T. Adachi R. Südhof T.C. Nature. 2007; 450: 676-682Crossref PubMed Scopus (270) Google Scholar, 17.Pang Z.P. Melicoff E. Padgett D. Liu Y. Teich A.F. Dickey B.F. Lin W. Adachi R. Südhof T.C. J. Neurosci. 2006; 26: 13493-13504Crossref PubMed Scopus (167) Google Scholar), so we wondered if this low Ca2+ affinity exocytic Syt may play a similar role in a non-neuronal cell, such as the MC, in which activation does not depend on Ca2+ entry through voltage-gated channels in the plasma membrane. Our first step was to confirm expression of Syt2 in normal MCs using cells from our Syt2−/− mice as negative controls. Immunoblots of Syt2+/+ MC lysates showed intense staining at ∼80 kDa, whereas Syt2−/− MC lysates showed no immunoreactivity at this mobility (Fig. 1A), and we observed perigranular immunohistochemical staining for Syt2 only in Syt2+/+ peritoneal MCs (Fig. 1B). Together, these results provide evidence of the expression of Syt2 in mature endogenous MCs. PCA models the acute phase of an allergic reaction. In PCA, we measure the localized vasodilation and increased endothelial permeability induced by products secreted by skin-resident MCs (26.Inagaki N. Goto S. Nagai H. Koda A. Int. Arch. Allergy Appl. Immunol. 1986; 81: 58-62Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). All animals we used are on a C57BL/6 genetic background. We initially found a decreased PCA response in Syt2−/− mice compared with Syt2+/+ mice (not shown). A flaw in these pilot experiments was that altered responses of Syt2-deficient cells other than MCs (e.g. vascular smooth muscle relaxation and endothelial cell retraction) could also be responsible for the observed difference. To avoid this confounding factor and to guarantee that only the MCs in our model will be differentially deficient or sufficient in Syt2, we reconstituted Syt2-sufficient MC-deficient Wsh/Wsh mice with BMMCs from Syt2−/− and Syt2+/+ mice. In histological analysis performed 6 weeks after reconstitution, we identified 101 ± 11 and 98 ± 9 (mean ± S.E.; n = 4) MCs per mm2 of dermis at the site of injection in Wsh/Wsh mice that received Syt2+/+ and Syt2−/− BMMCs, respectively. As shown in Fig. 2, MC-deficient animals failed to mount a response to the antigen challenge. This reaction was rescued by intradermic reconstitution with Syt2+/+ BMMCs. Reconstitution with Syt2−/− BMMCs provided only a partial (about one-third) rescue compared with Syt2+/+ BMMCs. Pharmacologic interventions have determined that PCA is highly dependent on histamine. Given that this vasoactive amine is stored in MC secretory granules and released during degranulation, and that the presence of a Ca2+-binding exocytic Syt defines an exocytic event as regulated, we postulated that the lack of Syt2 was negatively affecting MC-regulated exocytosis. To rule out the possibility that the defective response to PCA was due to an unexpected effect of the absence of Syt2 on some aspect of MC development, we examined MC structure and differentiation in Syt2−/− mice. We found no difference in the MC density in skin (Fig. 3A and Table 1), peritoneal fluid (Fig. 3B and Table 1), tongue, trachea, stomach, or jejunum (not shown) between Syt2+/+ and Syt2−/− mice. EM images of peritoneal MCs from animals of both genotypes were indistinguishable (Fig. 3C) and unbiased stereological analysis to measure the size and surface complexity of the cells and the number, size, and density of their granules showed no difference (Table 1). We also did not find a difference in the rate of differentiation of bone marrow cells into BMMCs in SCF and IL-3-enriched medium (Table 1) or in the surface density of immunoreactivity against cKit/CD117 and FcϵRIα in BMMCs after 6 weeks in culture (Fig. 3D). Morphometric analysis of electron micrographs of Syt2+/+ and Syt2−/− BMMCs also failed to uncover a difference (Fig. 3E and Table 1). As part of the secretion assays described below we found almost identical amounts of total cellular histamine (Table 1) and β-hexosaminidase activity (not shown) in unstimulated Syt2+/+ and Syt2−/− BMMCs.TABLE 1Quantitation, morphometry, and cellular contents of studied MCsSyt2+/+Syt2−/−Dermal MCsaFITC-avidin+ cells with a Hoechst+ nuclear profile per area of dermis in random sections of ear (10 samples/animal).106 cells/m2183 ± 15182 ± 12Peritoneal MCsbCalculated from Neubauer chamber counts and Wright-Giemsa staining of cytospins of peritoneal lavages (3 samples/animal).%9.7 ± 1.79.3 ± 1.1106 cells/liter180 ± 13174 ± 16Peritoneal MCscStereological analysis of randomly acquired EM images from peritoneal MCs and BMMCs after 6 weeks in culture (10 cell profiles/sample, 4 samples/animal).Vv0.25 ± 0.020.26 ± 0.02Sv, 10−6 m−122.89 ± 1.7121.82 ± 2.85A, 10−12 m233.82 ± 2.9732.76 ± 0.78BMMCs in culturedPercent of Kit+/FcϵRIα+ double positive cells in bone marrow cultures in medium enriched with SCF and IL-3 assessed by flow cytometry (1 sample/animal/time point).2 weeks, %17.2 ± 3.119.1 ± 3.94 weeks, %89.1 ± 4.486.2 ± 5.46 weeks, %97.5 ± 1.297.1 ± 1.4BMMCs (6 w)cStereological analysis of randomly acquired EM images from peritoneal MCs and BMMCs after 6 weeks in culture (10 cell profiles/sample, 4 samples/animal).Vv0.41 ± 0.040.39 ± 0.03Sv, 10−6 m−120.77 ± 2.0120.46 ± 1.14A, 10−12 m243.11 ± 2.8848.58 ± 2.78BMMCs histamineeTotal histamine concentration in lysates of 106 BMMCs measured by ELISA (1 sample/animal).10−3 g/liter0.93 ± 0.110.97 ± 0.09a FITC-avidin+ cells with a Hoechst+ nuclear profile per area of dermis in random sections of ear (10 samples/animal).b Calculated from Neubauer chamber counts and Wright-Giemsa staining of cytospins of peritoneal lavages (3 samples/animal).c Stereological analysis of randomly acquired EM images from peritoneal MCs and BMMCs after 6 weeks in culture (10 cell profiles/sample, 4 samples/animal).d Percent of Kit+/FcϵRIα+ double positive cells in bone marrow cultures in medium enriched with SCF and IL-3 assessed by flow cytometry (1 sample/animal/time point).e Total histamine concentration in lysates of 106 BMMCs measured by ELISA (1 sample/animal). Open table in a new tab Based on these results, we concluded that the lack of Syt2 did not affect the proliferation, migration, and maturation of MCs, the morphology of these cells and of their secretory granules, the expression of receptors important for their maturation and stimulation, and the storage of preformed inflammatory mediators in their secretory granules. Thus, none of these factors explained the defective acute allergic cutaneous response described in Fig. 2. Other possibilities that we needed to test were that the deficient PCA response was part of a more extensive defect affecting all forms of MC secretion and/or the activation of MCs. We studied the functional consequences of the absence of Syt2 in the three main MC secretory effector responses: regulated exocytosis, constitutive exocytosis, and nonexocytic secretion (6.Adachi R. Nigam R. Dickey B.F. Eissa N.T. Huston D.P. Mast Cell Exocytosis in Airway Inflammation, Therapeutic Targets in Airway Inflammation. Marcel Dekker, New York2003: 327-348Google Scholar). To simulate the conditions used in our PCA model, we used FcϵRI cross-linking to stimulate BMMCs from Syt2+/+ and Syt2−/− mice. After incubating the cells with anti-DNP IgE, we stimulated them by applying DNP-HSA. Because excess of polyvalent antigen can interfere with FcϵRI cross-linking, we used the antigen to cell ratio that induced the maximum secretory response in our system (106 BMMCs in 1 ml of DNP-HSA at 100 ng/ml, Fig. 4A). To assess exocytosed secretory granule contents, we measured the enzymatic activity of β-hexosaminidase (expressed as a fraction of total cellular content; Fig. 4, A and B) and the amount of histamine (expressed in absolute values, Fig. 4C) in the cell supernatants before and after stimulation. In both cases we found that Syt2−/− cells showed only about a third of the response found in Syt2+/+ cells. We next measured the release of cytokines under transcriptional control and secreted via constitutive exocytosis, and found no difference in the total amount released (TNF-α, Fig. 5A) or in the time course of this response (IL-4, Fig. 5B). We did not find any difference in the release of products that do not depend on exocytosis for their secretion such as PGD2 and LTC4 (Fig. 5, C and D).FIGURE 5Syt2 deficiency does not affect other MC secretory mechanisms. Secreted products were measured in supernatants of BMMCs from Syt2+/+ and Syt2−/− mice incubated with anti-DNP IgE before and at different time points after addition of DNP-HSA.

(Error bars represent S.E.)View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) The normal secretion of cytokines and lipid mediators, together with the normal surface expression of FcϵRIα (Fig. 3D), point to an intact IgE-dependent stimulation mechanism in MCs lacking Syt2, and excludes a defect in this pathway as an explanation for our findings. The presence of an abnormal and selective defect in degranulation confirms that, like in neurons and neuroendocrine cells, the presence of a Ca2+-binding Syt defines an exocytic step as a regulated event (7.Verhage M. Toonen R.F. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 2007; 19: 402-408Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). Our finding that Syt2 discriminates between the secretory compartment containing both β-hexosaminidase and histamine from that containing cytokines is very similar to the findings on VAMP-8 in MCs (27.Tiwari N. Wang C.C. Brochetta C. Ke G. Vita F. Qi Z. Rivera J. Soranzo M.R. Zabucchi G. Hong W. Blank U. Blood. 2008; 111: 3665-3674Crossref PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar). Another study suggested that VAMP-8 may further discriminate between subpopulations of granules released by regulated exocytosis, as it may control the release of serotonin, cathepsin-D, and β-hexosaminidase but not of histamine (28.Puri N. Roche P.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2008; 105: 2580-2585Crossref PubMed Scopus (168) Google Scholar). Because we found a similar defect in the secretion of β-hexosaminidase and histamine (Fig. 4, B and C), we postulate that there may be only a single secretory granule population that contains both mediators or that Syt2 controls the exocytosis of the two granule subpopulations. In nonexcitable cells, another Syt that regulates exocytic events is the high affinity Ca2+-binding Syt7 (29.Chakrabarti S. Kobayashi K.S. Flavell R.A. Marks C.B. Miyake K. Liston D.R. Fowler K.T. Gorelick F.S. Andrews N.W. J. Cell Biol. 2003; 162: 543-549Crossref PubMed Scopus (161) Google Scholar), an ubiquitously expressed protein that associates with lysosomal compartments. Although its function in MCs is not known, it is a good candidate to explain the residual exocytic response seen in Syt2−/− MCs. Similar functional redundancy can explain why the inhibition of VAMP-7, VAMP-8, and Stx-4 with neutralizing antibodies does not entirely inhibit the release of histamine from MCs compared with the complete suppression obtained with anti-SNAP-23 antibodies (30.Sander L.E. Frank S.P. Bolat S. Blank U. Galli T. Bigalke H. Bischoff S.C. Lorentz A. Eur. J. Immunol. 2008; 38: 855-863Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). Finally, we found no structural or functional difference between Syt2+/+ and Syt2+/− MCs (not shown), so there is no phenotypic haploinsufficiency, similar to our findings in synapses and neuromuscular junctions (16.Sun J.

Burns K.A. Chua M. Mohler P.J. Melicoff E. Adachi R. Ammar-Aouchiche Z. Davis C.W. Dickey B.F. J. Biol. Chem. 2009; 284: 9781-9787Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). In neurons, Syt2 plays a double role: it is required for the fast synchronized component of the evoked exocytic release of synaptic vesicles, and it also suppresses the slow nonsynchronized component of this process and the spontaneous exocytic events that occur in the absence of stimuli (16.Sun J. Pang Z.P. Qin D. Fahim A.T. Adachi R. Südhof T.C. Nature. 2007; 450: 676-682Crossref PubMed Scopus (270) Google Scholar, 17.Pang Z.P. Melicoff E. Padgett D. Liu Y. Teich A.F. Dickey B.F. Lin W. Adachi R. Südhof T.C. J. Neurosci. 2006; 26: 13493-13504Crossref PubMed Scopus (167) Google Scholar). As shown in Fig. 4C, we did not find a difference in the baseline concentration of histamine in the supernatants of Syt2+/+ and Syt2−/− BMMCs, even when these measurements were repeated over 24 h (results not shown). Also, as described in Table 1, the amount of histamine present in cells of both genotypes was almost identical, so there was no evidence of depletion of internal stores. Thus, like in neurons, Syt2 in MCs is required for an effective regulated exocytic response, but unlike in neurons, its absence does not produce an increase in spontaneous fusion events resulting in depletion of stored products. An explanation for this difference may be the nature of the membrane fusion machinery in these different cells. Neurotransmission takes place within milliseconds after an action potential induces influx of Ca2+. In neurons, secretory vesicles are docked at active zones with VAMP-2, SNAP-25, and Syntaxin-1 forming a partially coiled SNARE complex. The cytoplasmic protein complexin “clamps” the complex in this state and prevents complete coiling and membrane fusion. At low [Ca2+]i Syt promotes this action of complexin, but as [Ca2+]i rises, Syt displaces complexin and actively promotes the “zippering” of the quadruple helix, driving membrane fusion (32.Carr C.M. Munson M. EMBO Rep. 2007; 8: 834-838Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). In MCs, regulated exocytosis takes place over minutes and depends on different complexins, v- and t-SNAREs. Perhaps because there is no need for an immediate coupling of Ca2+ entry with exocytosis, the “clamping” effect of Syt2 is not required in MCs, and that may be a consequence of a different interaction with complexin or with the SNARE complex. An alternative explanation is that another Syt isoform plays this negative role in MC exocytosis. In neurons and muscle cells, some voltage-gated Ca2+ channels physically interact with the exocytic proteins Syntaxin, SNAP-25, and Syt. These interactions help localize synaptic vesicles to the active zone and alter the permeability to Ca2+ of these channels (33.Catterall W.A. Ann. N. Y. Acad. Sci. 1999; 868: 144-159Crossref PubMed Scopus (232) Google Scholar). Furthermore, some Syt channel complexes are the target of autoantibodies in Lambert-Eaton myastenic syndrome (34.Leveque C. Hoshino T. David P. Shoji-Kasai Y. Leys K. Omori A. Lang B. el Far O. Sato K. Martin-Moutot N. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 1992; 89: 3625-3629Crossref PubMed Scopus (190) Google Scholar). Even though there is no reported physical or functional interaction between a Syt and the inositol trisphosphate receptor, STIM (stromal interaction molecule), or components of the Ca2+ release activated Ca2+ channel such as Orai1/CRACM1, it was important to confirm that the defective exocytic response we found in Syt2−/− MCs was not due to an impairment of store-operated Ca2+ entry in this nonexcitable cell (35.Vig M. Kinet J.P. Cell Calcium. 2007; 42: 157-162Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). In purified peritoneal MCs passively sensitized with specific IgE, we found no difference in the increase of [Ca2+]i (Δ[Ca2+]i) after challenge by exposure to the cognate antigen (Fig. 6, A and B). Thus, it is a deficiency in a Ca2+ sensor, and not in upstream Ca2+ signaling that explains the degranulation defect in Syt2−/− MCs. Another possibility we explored was to determine whether the effects of lack of Syt2 in MCs were indirect, affecting exocytosis by altering the competence of the core exocytic machinery. For example, the deletion of VAMP-2 (36.Schoch S. Deák F. Königstorfer A. Mozhayeva M. Sara Y. Südhof T.C. Kavalali E.T. Science. 2001; 294: 1117-1122Crossref PubMed Scopus (514) Google Scholar) or SNAP-25 (37.Washbourne P. Thompson P.M. Carta M. Costa E.T. Mathews J.R. Lopez-Benditó G. Molnár Z. Becher M.W. Valenzuela C.F. Partridge L.D. Wilson M.C. Nat. Neurosci. 2002; 5: 19-26Crossref PubMed Scopus (7) Google Scholar) produces a defect in neurotransmitter release that cannot be overcome by any stimulus because a core component of the neuronal exocytic machinery is absent. Single peritoneal MCs from Syt2+/+ and Syt2−/− mice were strongly stimulated by intracellular dialysis with GTPγS and a persistent high [Ca2+]i (25.Fernandez J.M. Neher E. Gomperts B.D. Nature. 1984; 312: 453-455Crossref PubMed Scopus (376) Google Scholar), while measuring plasma membrane capacitance (Cm). We found no difference in plasma membrane capacitance gain (ΔCm), demonstrating that the total amount of granule membrane incorporated into the plasma membrane via exocytosis was the same, and therefore that the membrane fusion machinery was intact (Fig. 6, C and D). Similar to our findings, application of an intervention that induces neuronal exocytosis via a mechanism independent of Syts (hypertonic sucrose) to neurons deficient in Syt1 (14.Geppert M. Goda Y. Hammer R.E. Li C. Rosahl T.W. Stevens C.F. Südhof T.C. Cell. 1994; 79: 717-727Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1217) Google Scholar), Syt2 (16.Sun J. Pang Z.P. Qin D. Fahim A.T. Adachi R.

Neuron. 2007; 54: 567-581Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (245) Google Scholar) elicited similar levels of vesicle fusion when compared with wild-type controls. We found that Syt2 controls exclusively regulated exocytosis in MCs in vitro and in vivo and not constitutive exocytosis or nonexocytic secretion. We also found that this Ca2+ sensor has no “clamping” activity on spontaneous exocytosis in this nonexcitable cell. Although the defect in Syt2-deficient mice is profound, it is not absolute, and it would be interesting to explore if another Syt such as Syt7 could explain this residual exocytic activity. We also found that the PCA reaction is highly dependent on MC-regulated exocytosis, suggesting that it may be possible to control the acute phase of the allergic response by manipulating this exocytic step."
https://openalex.org/W2018644256,"The pneumococcal surface protein C (PspC) is a major adhesin of <i>Streptococcus pneumoniae</i>, the cause of lobar pneumonia and invasive diseases. PspC interacts in a human-specific manner with the ectodomain of the human polymeric immunoglobulin receptor (pIgR) produced by respiratory epithelial cells. By adopting the retrograde machinery of human pIgR, this protein-protein interaction promotes colonization and transcytosis across the epithelial layer. Here, we explored the role of Rho family guanosine triphosphatases (GTPases), phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K) and protein kinase B (Akt) for ingestion of pneumococci via the human pIgR. Inhibition experiments suggested that the host-cell actin microfilaments and microtubules are essential for this pneumococcal uptake mechanism. By using specific GTPase-modifying toxins, inhibitors, and GTPase expression constructs we demonstrate that Cdc42, but not Rac1 and RhoA are involved in PspC-mediated invasion of pneumococci into host cells. Accordingly, Cdc42 is time-dependently activated during ingestion of pneumococci. In addition, PI3K and Akt are essential for ingestion of pneumococci by respiratory epithelial cells via the PspC-pIgR interaction. The subunit p85α of PI3K and Akt was activated during the infection process. Moreover, Akt activation upon pneumococcal invasion depends on PI3K. In conclusion, our results illustrate for the first time key signaling molecules of host cells that are required for PspC-pIgR-mediated invasion of pneumococci into epithelial cells. This unique and specific bacterial entry process is dependent on the cooperation and activation of Rho family GTPase Cdc42, PI3K, and Akt."
https://openalex.org/W1964511529,"The myosin neck, which is supported by the interactions between light chains and the underlying alpha-helical heavy chain, is thought to act as a lever arm to amplify movements originating in the globular motor domain. Here, we studied the role of the cardiac myosin regulatory light chains (RLCs) in the capacity of myosin to produce force using a novel optical-trap-based isometric force in vitro motility assay. We measured the isometric force and actin filament velocity for native porcine cardiac (PC) myosin, RLC-depleted PC (PC(depl)) myosin, and PC myosin reconstituted with recombinant bacterially expressed human cardiac RLC (PC(recon)). RLC depletion reduced unloaded actin filament velocity by 58% and enhanced the myosin-based isometric force approximately 2-fold. No significant change between PC and PC(depl) preparations was observed in the maximal rate of actin-activated myosin ATPase activity. Reconstitution of PC(depl) myosin with human RLC partially restored the velocity and force levels to near untreated values. The reduction in unloaded velocity after RLC extraction is consistent with the myosin neck acting as a lever, while the enhancement in isometric force can be directly related to enhancement of unitary force. The force data are consistent with a model in which the neck region behaves as a cantilevered beam."

The complexity of eukaryotic Ca2+ signaling arises from the ability of cells to respond differently to Ca2+ signals that vary in amplitude, duration, and location. A variety of mechanisms decode these signals to drive the appropriate physiological responses. The Ca2+ sensor for many of these physiological responses is the Ca2+-binding protein calmodulin (CaM). 2The abbreviations used are: CaMcalmodulinPDBProtein Data BankN-lobeamino-terminal domain of calmodulinC-lobecarboxy-terminal domain of calmodulinRyRryanodine receptorapoCaMCa2+-free calmodulinCa2+-CaMcalmodulin bound to four Ca2+CDFCa2+-dependent facilitationCDICa2+-dependent inactivationMOPS3-(N-morpholino)propanesulfonic acidr.m.s.d.root mean square deviationIAEDANS5-((((2-iodoacetyl)amino)ethyl)amino)naphthalene-1-sulfonic acidDDPMN-(4-dimethylamino-3,5-dinitrophenyl)maleimideFRETfluorescence resonance energy transferSPRsurface plasmon resonanceCaMDAcalmodulin labeled with donor and acceptorCaMDcalmodulin labeled with donor only. The primary sequence of CaM is tightly conserved in all eukaryotes, yet it binds and regulates a broad set of target proteins in response to Ca2+ binding. CaM has two domains that bind Ca2+ as follows: an amino-terminal domain (N-lobe) and a carboxyl-terminal domain (C-lobe) joined via a flexible α-helix. Each lobe of CaM binds two Ca2+ ions, and binding within each lobe is highly cooperative. The two lobes of CaM, however, have distinct Ca2+ binding properties; the C-lobe has higher Ca2+ affinity because of a slower rate of dissociation, whereas the N-lobe has weaker Ca2+ affinity and faster kinetics (1Black D.J. Halling D.B. Mandich D.V. Pedersen S.E. Altschuld R.A. Hamilton S.L. Am. J. Physiol. Cell Physiol. 2005; 288: C669-676Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). CaM can also bind to some target proteins in both the presence and absence of Ca2+, and the preassociation of CaM in low Ca2+ modulates the apparent Ca2+ affinity of both the amino-terminal and carboxyl-terminal lobes. Differences in the Ca2+ binding properties of the lobes and in the interaction sites of the amino- and carboxyl-terminal lobes enable CaM to decode local versus global Ca2+ signals (2Tadross M.R.

Even though CaM is highly conserved, CaM target (or recognition) sites are quite heterogeneous. The ability of CaM to bind to very different targets is at least partially due to its flexibility, which allows it to assume different conformations when bound to different targets. CaM also binds to various targets in distinct Ca2+ saturation states as follows: Ca2+-free (3Houdusse A. Gaucher J.F. Krementsova E. Mui S. Trybus K.M. Cohen C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci.

If a target site can bind multiple conformers of CaM, CaM may undergo several transitions that depend on Ca2+ concentration, thereby tuning the functional response. Identification of stable intermediate states of CaM bound to individual targets will help to elucidate the steps involved in this fine-tuned control.

Differences in the rate at which 1,2-bis(o-aminophenoxy)ethane-N,N,N′,N′-tetraacetic acid affects CDI of CaV1.1 and CaV1.2 could reflect differences in their interactions with CaM. In this study we describe the differences in CaM interactions with the IQ motifs of the CaV1.1 and the CaV1.2 channels in terms of crystal structure, CaM affinity, and Ca2+ binding to CaM. We find the structures of Ca2+-CaM-IQ complexes are similar except for a single amino acid change in the peptide that contributes to its affinity for CaM. We also find that the other three amino acids that differ in CaV1.2 and CaV1.1 contribute to the ability of CaV1.2 to bind a partially Ca2+-saturated form of CaM. All peptides used were either synthesized in the core facility at the Baylor College of Medicine under the direction of Dr. Richard Cook or by GenScript Corp. (Piscataway, NJ). CaV1.1 IQB and CaV1.2 IQB peptides had a six-carbon biotin linker attached via an additional modified lysine at the carboxyl terminus of the peptide (CPC Scientific Inc., San Jose, CA).

The complex of CaM-CaV1.1 IQ peptide complex was purified following the procedure described for the CaM-CaV1.2 IQ peptide complex (28Fallon J.L. Halling D.B. Hamilton S.L. Quiocho F.A.

The complex was concentrated to 10 mg/ml in a buffer containing 20 mm MOPS, pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl, and 10 mm CaCl2. Crystals were grown by vapor diffusion by mixing 2 μl of complex into a 4-μl drop of a milieu from the well containing 32% polyethylene glycol 3500, 50 mm Tris, 50 mm MgCl2. Large football-shaped crystals grew to full size in 2 weeks in a Torrey Pines Scientific incubator (San Marcos, CA) at 20 °C.

Open table in a new tab Surface plasmon resonance (SPR) with a Biacore3000 instrument (GE Biacore, Inc., Piscataway, NJ) was used to assess the affinity of CaM, E12QCaM, and E34QCaM for the biotinylated wild type and mutant IQ peptides (Table 2). Sensor chip SA was conditioned according to the manufacturer's protocol, and biotinylated wild type or mutant IQ peptides were immobilized to a sensor chip SA by loading 100 μl of 3 nm peptide in running buffer containing 3 mm CaCl2, 30 mm MOPS, 100 mm KCl, 0.1 mg/ml BSA, 0.005% Tween 20, 0.02% NaN3, pH 7.5, at a flow rate of 30 μl/min. Biotin (5–10 μl of 300 nm) alone was immobilized to control flow cells on the chip and used to subtract bulk movement of CaM, the analyte, to the chip during binding. Peptide immobilization was preceded and followed by a system desorb. CaM, E12QCaM, and E34QCaM were injected at a flow rate of 30 μl/min. All experiments were performed in triplicate; each sensorgram representing an independent dilution. KD values were determined by fitting the amplitudes of the plateau phase as a function of CaM concentration using a one- or two-site saturation model.TABLE 2Synthetic peptide sequencesAccession no.α1 subunitSequence no.NameSequenceQ13936CaV1.21665–1685CaV1.2 IQKFYATFLIQEYFRKFKKRKEQQ13698CaV1.11522–1542CaV1.1 IQKFYATFLIQEHFRKFMKRQEEMutantCaV1.2CaV1.2 Y1675HKFYATFLIQEHFRKFKKRKEQMutantCaV1.1CaV1.1 H1532YKFYATFLIQEYFRKFMKRQEEMutantCaV1.1CaV1.1/H1532Y/M1537KKFYATFLIQEYFRKFKKRQEEMutantCaV1.1CaV1.1/H1532Y/Q1540KKFYATFLIQEYFRKFMKRKEEMutantCaV1.1CaV1.1/H1532Y/E1542QKFYATFLIQEYFRKFMKRQEQMutantCaV1.1CaV1.1/H1532Y/M1537K/Q1540KKFYATFLIQEYFRKFKKRKEEBiotinylatedCaV1.2CaV1.2 IQBaModified lysine residue was inserted to attach linker for biotin tag.KFYATFLIQEYFRKFKKRKEQK,-C6-biotinBiotinylatedCaV1.1CaV1.1 IQBaModified lysine residue was inserted to attach linker for biotin tag.KFYATFLIQEHFRKFMKRQEEK-C6-biotinBiotinylatedCaV1.2CaV1.2 Y1675H-IQBaModified lysine residue was inserted to attach linker for biotin tag.KFYATFLIQEHFRKFKKRKEQK-C6-biotinBiotinylatedCaV1.1CaV1.1 H1532Y-IQBaModified lysine residue was inserted to attach linker for biotin tag.KFYATFLIQEYFRKFMKRQEEK-C6-biotina Modified lysine residue was inserted to attach linker for biotin tag.

For FRET measurements, 200 nm labeled CaM was incubated with 1 μm peptide for 1 h at room temperature in a 20 μm Ca2+ buffer from Molecular Probes (Ca2+ calibration buffer kit 3). Fluorescence was measured at 400–625 nm with an SLM8000 spectrofluorometer with 350 nm excitation. Settings included 8-nm bandpass excitation and emission slits, 309 nm cut-on excitation filter, 395 nm cut-on emission filter, and 1-s integration times. All spectra had the same spectral maximum near 493 nm, and bar graphs reflect the observations at this wavelength. Stopped-flow experiments were performed as described (1Black D.J. Halling D.B.

Represented data were averages of 5–8 individual traces fit with either a single or double exponential curve after premixing reached equilibrium. Tryptophan fluorescence was measured after rapidly mixing equal volumes (50 μl each) of solution A, F19WCaM or F92WCaM (4 μm), peptide (20 μm), and Ca2+ (200 μm) in 10 mm MOPS, 90 mm KCl, pH 7.0, with solution B, EGTA (10 mm). All traces were fit with the exponential Equation 1, where A is the amplitude of the fluorescence change, and k is the rate at which the change is occurring. Ca2+ dissociation rates (1Black D.J. Halling D.B. Mandich D.V. Pedersen S.E. Altschuld R.A. Hamilton S.L. Am. J. Physiol. Cell Physiol. 2005; 288: C669-676Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar) were also determined with Quin-2. Solution A (CaM (8 μm), IQ peptide (40 μm), Ca2+ (15 μm) in 10 mm MOPS, and 90 mm KCl, pH 7.0) was rapidly mixed with an equal volume of solution B, Quin-2 (150 μm). The reaction was monitored by exciting fluorescence at 330 nm and measuring light emission with 510-nm broad bandpass filter (Oriel) in place. Quin-2 fluorescence traces required fits with the double exponential Equation 2, where A1 and A2 are component amplitudes of the fluorescence change, and k1 and k2 are the corresponding rates of change. The double exponential reflects the Ca2+ dissociation rates from both the N-lobe (fast) and the C-lobe (slow). The molar quantity of Ca2+ dissociating from CaM was calculated by monitoring the increase in Quin-2 fluorescence with increasing concentrations of Ca2+ standards (10, 20, 40, and 80 μm) (34Johnson J.D. Snyder C. Walsh M. Flynn M. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 761-767Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar). To define the determinants for interaction of CaV1.1 IQ and CaV1.2 IQ (differing by four amino acids) with CaM, we obtained crystals of Ca2+-CaM bound to the CaV1.1 IQ peptide and determined the structure to 1.94 Å resolution (Table 1). The crystals are isomorphous to those formed with CaV1.2 IQ, and the crystal properties (Table 1) are very similar to those of the complex with CaV1.2 IQ peptide, but the CaM/CaV1.2 structure was determined at a higher resolution of 1.45 Å (28Fallon J.L. Halling D.B. Hamilton S.L. Quiocho F.A. Structure. 2005; 13: 1881-1886Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar). The N-lobe of CaM binds the amino terminus of the CaV1.1 IQ peptide, and the C-lobe binds the carboxyl terminus of CaV1.1 IQ in a parallel arrangement similar to that seen with CaV1.2 IQ (Fig. 1, A and D) and other IQ peptides (28Fallon J.L.

Biol. 2005; 12: 1108-1115Crossref PubMed Scopus (205) Google Scholar). As expected from the identity of the amino-terminal portions of the CaV1.1 IQ and CaV1.2 IQ peptides, the N-lobe of CaM binds the amino-terminal peptide sequences in nearly identical conformations (Fig. 1, B and E). The root mean square deviation (r.m.s.d.) for the backbone atoms of the superimposed N-lobes is 0.34 Å. This value is about 2-fold smaller than the r.m.s.d. of 0.75 Å for the superimposed C-lobes, both of which are smaller than the overall backbone r.m.s.d. of 0.88 Å for the superimposed structures of the two CaM-peptide complexes. This indicates a difference in the relative orientation between the two lobes in the two structures. Other differences are detected in the C-lobe interactions. There is a salt bridge between Arg-1539 on the CaV1.1 IQ peptide and Glu-127 of CaM that was not observed in our CaV1.2 IQ-CaM structure (28Fallon J.L. Halling D.B. Hamilton S.L. Quiocho F.A. Structure. 2005; 13: 1881-1886Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar), but it was seen in the structure by Van Petegem et al. (36Van Petegem F. Chatelain F.C. Minor Jr., D.L. Nat. Struct. Mol. Biol. 2005; 12: 1108-1115Crossref PubMed Scopus (205) Google Scholar). Of the four nonconserved residues, only His-1532 on CaV1.1 IQ (Fig. 1, A and C) and Tyr-1675 in CaV1.2 IQ (Fig. 1, D and F) contact Ca2+-CaM. In Ca2+-CaM/CaV1.2 IQ, a water molecule forms hydrogen bonds both with the hydroxyl group side chain of the Tyr-1675 and with the carbonyl oxygen of the Met-124 main chain (28Fallon J.L. Halling D.B. Hamilton S.L. Quiocho F.A. Structure. 2005; 13: 1881-1886Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar). A hydrophobic pocket formed by four C-lobe methionine side chains is more collapsed around His-1532 (Fig. 1C). This Ca2+-CaM methionine pocket expands around the bulkier Tyr-1675 on the CaV1.2 IQ peptide (Fig. 1F). Although the methionine side chains are slightly farther away from Tyr-1675, the α-carbon atoms are actually drawn inward toward the tyrosine. When comparing structures, the main chain α-carbon atoms of residues of Met-109, Met-124, Met-144, and Met-145 are displaced by 0.54, 0.18, 0.52, and 0.38 Å, respectively. The α-carbon to α-carbon distance from Met-109 to Met-145 is 0.41 Å closer in the presence of CaV1.2 IQ than in the presen"
https://openalex.org/W2095254823,"The Drosophila pericentrin-like protein has been shown to be essential for the formation of the sensory cilia of chemosensory and mechanosensory neurons by mutant analysis in flies, while the in vivo function of pericentrin, a well-studied mammalian centrosomal protein related to microcephalic primordial dwarfism, has been unclear. To determine whether pericentrin is required for ciliogenesis in mammals, we generated and analyzed mice with a hypomorphic mutation of Pcnt encoding the mouse pericentrin. Immunofluorescence analysis demonstrated that olfactory cilia of chemosensory neurons in the nasal olfactory epithelium were malformed in the homozygous mutant mice. On the other hand, the assembly of motile and primary cilia of non-neuronal epithelial cells and the formation of sperm flagella were not affected in the Pcnt-mutant mice. The defective assembly of olfactory cilia in the mutant was apparent from birth. The mutant animals displayed reduced olfactory performance in agreement with the compromised assembly of olfactory cilia. Our findings suggest that pericentrin is essential for the assembly of chemosensory cilia of olfactory receptor neurons, but it is not globally required for cilia formation in mammals."

Chicken anti-human MD-2 polyclonal antibodies were prepared against recombinant human MD-2 by GenTel (Madison, WI), monoclonal mouse anti-human MD-2 9B4 antibodies were ordered from eBioscience (San Diego, CA), and secondary goat anti-mouse IgG antibodies conjugated with horseradish peroxidase were from Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc. (Santa Cruz, CA). Human embryonic kidney 293 and 293T (HEK293 and HEK293T) cells were cultured as an adherent monolayer at 37 °C, 5% CO2, and normal humidity in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (Invitrogen) supplemented with 10% (v/v) fetal bovine serum (BioWhittaker, Walkersville, MD). Mouse macrophages RAW264.7 were cultured as suspension cells in RPMI 1640 (Invitrogen) supplemented with 12% (v/v) fetal bovine serum (BioWhittaker). A specific point mutation was introduced into plasmid pET14b human MD-2 using site-directed mutagenesis. A site-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA) was used, and the reaction was performed according to the manufacturer's instructions. The sequences of primers used to change the amino acid residue Cys133 to Phe were 5-AAATTTTCTAAGGGAAAATACAAATTTGTTGTTGAAGCTATTTCTGGGAG-3 and 5-CTCCCAGAAATAGCTTCAACAACAAATTTGTATTTTCCCTTAGAAAATTT-3. The complete sequence of MD-2 mutant was verified by DNA sequencing. Recombinant MD-2 was produced in Escherichia coli as described previously (8.Gruber A. Mancek M. Wagner H. Kirschning C.J. Jerala R. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 28475-28482Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar), using solubilization of inclusion bodies followed by their purification and refolding on reversed phase column chromatography. Biological activity of MD-2 was tested on HEK293 cells transfected with TLR4. Fluorescence measurements were performed with an LS55 spectrofluorimeter (PerkinElmer Life Sciences) with a double monochromator. All measurements were done in 10 mm Tris-HCl buffer, pH 7.5, at 25 °C in a 5 × 5-mm quartz cell. A slit width of 5 nm was used for both excitation and emission. MD-2 WT or MD-2C133F (1 μm) was added to 5 μm compound solution. Binding of fluorescent IAANS and N-pyrene maleimide to MD-2 was measured using an excitation wavelength of 326 and 338 nm, respectively. Displacement of fluorescent probe bis-ANS was used to determine binding of nonfluorescent auranofin to MD-2. 1 μm bis-ANS and 1 μm MD-2 were mixed and incubated to reach stable fluorescence at an excitation wavelength of 380 nm. Then auranofin was added in 2 μm increments, and decrease of the initial emission fluorescence was followed. Distribution of N-pyrene maleimide between the aqueous and organic phase was determined by extraction with chloroform. 1 volume of N-pyrene maleimide (40 μm) in 10 mm Tris-HCl buffer, pH 7.5, was extracted with 2 volumes of chloroform. The extraction was repeated twice. Afterward, the content of N-pyrene maleimide in aqueous and organic phase was determined by fluorescence measurement at an excitation wavelength of 338 nm. MD-2 (10 μm) was added to the aqueous solution of N-pyrene maleimide and incubated for 2 h at 25 °C. As a control, either MD-2 WT, which was preincubated with 50 μm of iodoacetamide to block free cysteine residues, or a mutant MD-2C133F was used in the reaction. The requirement for the native conformation and formation of a covalent bond between N-pyrene maleimide and MD-2 was analyzed by the addition of guanidine HCl (6 m) to the mixture of MD-2 with N-pyrene maleimide after previous preincubation and followed by chloroform extraction as described above. The extraction removed unbound and noncovalently bound compound. The complex was then precipitated with 5 volumes of ice-cold acetone for 1 h at −20 °C and centrifuged. Acetone was removed, and the pellet was washed with acetone. The pellet was then resolved in 6 m guanidine HCl, and the fluorescence spectra of samples were measured. An ELISA was used to determine binding of selected compounds to MD-2. Polyclonal chicken anti-human MD-2 antibodies in 50 mm Na2CO3, pH 9.6, were used to coat a 96-well microtiter plate. The plate was incubated overnight at 4 °C and then rinsed with phosphate-buffered saline. Excess binding sites were blocked with 1% bovine serum albumin (Sigma) in phosphate-buffered saline buffer. 1 μm MD-2 WT in 10 mm Tris-HCl buffer, pH 7.5, was preincubated with IAANS, N-pyrene maleimide, JTT-705, or auranofin in the range from 0 to 20 μm for 2 h at 25 °C. As a negative control, compounds were preincubated in buffer. 200 μl/well of preincubated solutions were added into a precoated plate and were incubated for 2 h at 25 °C. After rinsing, MD-2 bound to coated polyclonal chicken anti-MD-2 antibodies was detected by primary mouse anti-human MD-2 9B4 monoclonal antibodies, followed by secondary goat anti-mouse IgG antibodies conjugated with horseradish peroxidase. Both steps were carried out in phosphate-buffered saline for 1.5 h at 37 °C. Horseradish peroxidase was detected using 2,2′-azinobis(3-ethylbenzthiazoline-6-sulfonic acid) substrate (Sigma). When color was developed, the reaction was stopped with 1% SDS, and the absorbance at 420 nm was measured. The compounds were investigated also for binding to the mutant MD-2C133F by the same procedure. RAW264.7 cells were seeded at 2 × 105 cells/96-well in RPMI containing 12% fetal bovine serum and 100 μm PTIO. Individual compound was added and preincubated for 1 h. Cells were then stimulated with 100 ng/ml LPS overnight. NO was detected in supernatants using Griess reagent (Sigma). A standard curve was prepared using sodium nitrite, and absorbance measurements were converted to concentrations. To determine the effect of JTT-705 and auranofin on the activity of recombinant hMD-2, 2 μm hMD-2 WT or hMD-2C133F was mixed with 0, 40, 100, 200, or 300 μm concentrations of compound in 2 mm Tris-HCl buffer, pH 7.5, to allow thiolate reactivity of a cysteine residue and incubated for 1 h at room temperature. HEK293 cells were transiently transfected with hTLR4 expression vector as well as NF- κB-dependent luciferase and constitutive Renilla reporter plasmids. 6 h later, transfection media were changed, and 5 μl of MD-2·JTT-705 complex was added per well to reach 100 nm final concentration of MD-2. After 1 h of incubation, cells were stimulated with 100 ng/ml LPS. After 16 h, cells were lysed and analyzed for reporter gene activities using a dual luciferase reporter assay system on a Mithras LB940 luminometer. Data from luciferase activity were normalized using Renilla luciferase readings. Inhibition of the MyD88-dependent signaling pathway was determined by transfecting HEK293T cells with 3 ng of MyD88 expression vector and NF-κB-dependent luciferase reporter plasmids. 6 h later, transfection medium was changed followed by the addition of JTT-705 or auranofin and incubated for 16 h. Cells were lysed and analyzed for luciferase activity as described above. Mouse feed pellets containing JTT-705 were made by first mixing 50 mg of the compound with 300 g of powdered mouse feed (Harlan) using an electric food blender. Then 75 ml of a 5% solution of cornstarch was added to the mixture, and the suspension was thoroughly homogenized in the food mixer, divided into pellets, and dehydrated in a glassware air dryer. Female C57BL/6J mice weighing 13–16 g were purchased from Harlan Spain (Harlan Interfauna Iberica S.A., Barcelona, Spain) and randomly distributed in experimental groups (n = 8). Animals provided with JTT-705-containing pellets ate their feed at the same rate (4 g/day, approximately) as animals fed regular mouse feed, and all mice had a similar weight at the end of the feeding period. 6 days after the beginning of the treatment, animals received an intraperitoneal injection containing a mixture of 50 ng of LPS and 18 mg of d-galactosamine resuspended in 200 μl of endotoxin-free saline following the method of Galanos et al. (20.Galanos C. Freudenberg M.A. Reutter W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 1979; 76: 5939-5943Crossref PubMed Scopus (844) Google Scholar). In previous experiments, this dose of LPS-galactosamine killed 90–100% of the animals 48 h postinoculation. As a positive control of protection against endotoxic shock, mice from one of the groups fed regular mouse pellets received 150 μl of pyrogen-free saline containing 150 μg of polymyxin B (PMB) immediately after LPS challenge. To facilitate the therapeutic action of PMB, mice were gently massaged at the site of inoculation for a few seconds. Animal mortality was monitored at 6 and 12 h postinoculation and at daily intervals for 5 days. In separate experiments, serum levels of TNFα were determined in the animal groups (n = 4) at 60 min postinoculation coinciding with the cytokine peak production as established in previous experiments. For that purpose, mice were anesthetized, a sample of blood was obtained by cardiac puncture, and serum levels of TNFα were quantified using the Quantikine TNFα immunoassay kit (R&D Systems, Minneapolis, MI) following the manufacturer's instructions. All of the animal protocols used in this study were approved by the University of Navarra Animal Research Committee (protocol number 035/05). The coordinates of human MD-2 (Protein Data Bank code 2E59) and models of compounds created by geometry minimization using Chemscape were used for docking calculations with AutoDock. Protein was kept rigid, whereas in the ligands 1–4 bonds were flexible, producing 100 docked structures. Crystal structure of MD-2 in complex with the tetraacylated antagonists lipid IVa and eritoran clearly identified the binding site for lipid A derivatives (11.Ohto U. Fukase K. Miyake K. Satow Y. Science. 2007; 316: 1632-1634Crossref PubMed Scopus (402) Google Scholar, 12.Kim H.M. Park B.S. Kim J.I. Kim S.E. Lee J. Oh S.C. Enkhbayar P. Matsushima N. Lee H. Yoo O.J. Lee J.O. Cell. 2007; 130: 906-917Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (880) Google Scholar). Most contacts between the protein and a ligand are achieved through hydrophobic interactions between hydrophobic residues of MD-2 and fatty acid chains of lipid A. Polar interactions are involved in a relatively low number of contacts. A single free cysteine residue (Cys133) is conserved in all MD-2 orthologues but not in the MD-1 family, which does not bind LPS or activate LPS signaling (10.Mancek-Keber M. Jerala R. FASEB J. 2006; 20: 1836-1842Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). Cys133 lies inside the hydrophobic binding pocket and is exposed to solvent (Fig. 1A). Its replacement with hydrophobic residues retains the functional activity of MD-2 (6.Kawasaki K. Nogawa H. Nishijima M. J. Immunol. 2003; 170: 413-420Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar, 10.Mancek-Keber M. Jerala R. FASEB J. 2006; 20: 1836-1842Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). Due to the structural considerations described above, we anticipated that compounds comprising both the cysteine-reactive group and large hydrophobic moiety could increase the selectivity for targeting MD-2 and thus more effectively inhibit the LPS signaling pathway. We predicted that this type of interaction with MD-2 should prevent LPS binding. To test this hypothesis, we selected four compounds with the above mentioned requirements (Fig. 1B). Two of the compounds, IAANS and N-pyrene maleimide, were selected among the intrinsically fluorescent thiol-reactive compounds, whose binding to MD-2 could be monitored by fluorescence. Both fluorophores contain a bulky lipophilic moiety, which contributes to the binding energy and leads the thiol-reactive compound toward its target. Additionally, IAANS contains the ANS group, for which we previously showed high affinity for MD-2 (10.Mancek-Keber M. Jerala R. FASEB J. 2006; 20: 1836-1842Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). Two further compounds that comply with the set of desired structural motifs were selected among the drugs that are in clinical use or in clinical studies for different indications and whose literature data suggested immunosuppression of LPS stimulation (21.Bondeson J. Sundler R. Biochem. Pharmacol. 1995; 50: 1753-1759Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar, 22.Youn H.S. Lee J.Y. Saitoh S.I. Miyake K. Hwang D.H. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2006; 350: 866-871Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). Thioester JTT-705 has been developed as an inhibitor of CETP (14.Okamoto H. Yonemori F. Wakitani K. Minowa T. Maeda K. Shinkai H. Nature. 2000; 406: 203-207Crossref PubMed Scopus (512) Google Scholar). CETP contains a free cysteine residue within a pocket where cholesteryl ester binds and therefore in many ways possesses structural properties resembling those of the MD-2 pocket. The second tested compound was auranofin, which is used as an anti-rheumatic drug. Auranofin is a gold-containing compound with sulfur-linked organic ligands. Au(I) has thiol reactivity, and proteins with free cysteine residues represent its potential targets (23.Jeon K.I. Byun M.S. Jue D.M. Exp. Mol. Med. 2003; 35: 61-66Crossref PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar). IAANS and N-pyrene maleimide are fluorescent probes, and their fluorescence increases in nonpolar environment, such as organic solvent or upon binding to protein hydrophobic sites. Fluorescence of both IAANS (Fig. 2A) and N-pyrene maleimide (Fig. 2B) increased significantly by the addition of WT MD-2. Significantly lower fluorescence increase was measured by the addition of MD-2C133F. The remaining interaction is probably due to the noncovalent reversible binding of the probe to MD-2 mutant. Binding of auranofin could not be determined through direct fluorescence, since the compound does not posses intrinsic fluorescence. Therefore, we used a competition displacement assay with bis-ANS as before to determine competition with LPS (10.Mancek-Keber M. Jerala R. FASEB J. 2006; 20: 1836-1842Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). The gradual addition of auranofin to the bis-ANS·MD-2 complex displaced bis-ANS from MD-2, causing a decrease of fluorescence (Fig. 2C), as expected for its binding to MD-2. N-Pyrene maleimide contains a maleimide group that can form a thioester with free thiol-containing polypeptides. We have therefore tested our hypothesis that N-pyrene maleimide forms a covalent bond with MD-2 using extraction of N-pyrene maleimide into the organic solvent. Essentially all of the reagent transferred from the aqueous into the organic phase. The addition of WT MD-2, MD-2C133F mutant, or WT MD-2 with blocked free thiol group retained a significant amount of N-pyrene maleimide in the aqueous phase (Fig. 3A), which can be attributed to the affinity of N-pyrene maleimide for the binding site on MD-2. Chemical unfolding of protein should disrupt the binding site and release the noncovalently bound fluorophore, whereas the covalently bound compound, on the other hand, should remain with the protein in the aqueous phase. Fig. 3B shows that unfolding of WT MD-2 by the addition of 6 m guanidine HCl, subsequent to the formation of a MD-2·N-pyrene maleimide complex, indeed retained N-pyrene maleimide in the aqueous phase after extraction, demonstrating the formation of a covalent bond. In the case of the C133F mutant or when the thiol group of WT MD-2 was carboxymethylated, complete transfer of N-pyrene maleimide into the organic phase occurred from the denatured protein solution. We expected that the binding site for IAANS, N-pyrene maleimide, JTT-705, and auranofin on MD-2 would overlap with the binding site for LPS. To test this experimentally, we performed an ELISA type of assay where detection of MD-2·compound complex was carried out with anti-MD-2 monoclonal antibody. Since its binding to MD-2 is inhibited by LPS (24.Viriyakosol S. McCray P.B. Ashbaugh M.E. Chu J. Jia H.P. Weiss J. Kirkland T.N. Hybridoma. 2006; 25: 349-357Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar), occupation of the LPS-binding site by the compounds could also prevent recognition by antibody. We demonstrated that all tested compounds bound to MD-2 inhibited binding in a concentration-dependent manner but less efficiently than LPS (Fig. 4). Inhibition of antibody binding due to the competition with the investigated compound was maximal for IAANS (45%), followed by the N-pyrene maleimide (35%), auranofin (32%), and JTT-705 (30%). We may ascribe lower inhibitory capacity of compounds to their smaller size and affinity. We determined that lipid A inhibited antibody binding at 40% of the LPS value, which is probably due to the steric effects of the carbohydrates of the LPS. Based on those results, we further expected that binding of compounds to MD-2 would prevent LPS activation of macrophages. We demonstrated that IAANS, N-pyrene maleimide, JTT-705, and auranofin inhibit LPS stimulated NO production in mouse RAW264.7 macrophages (Fig. 5). The most efficient compounds were auranofin and N-pyrene maleimide with IC50 lower than 1 μm, whereas JTT-705 and IAANS achieved 50% inhibition above 30 μm. Since auranofin has been described as an inhibitor of TLR4 dimerization and the MyD88-dependent signaling pathway (22.Youn H.S. Lee J.Y. Saitoh S.I. Miyake K. Hwang D.H. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2006; 350: 866-871Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar), inhibition of NO production could be due to the inhibition of downstream signaling. An additional experiment was performed, where MyD88 was overexpressed in HEK293T cells to investigate the potential inhibition downstream of MyD88. Auranofin and partially JTT-705 inhibited NF-κB activation induced by the overexpression of MyD88; however, 5 μm auranofin was required to significantly inhibit NF-κB activation (Fig. 6). On the other hand, already 2 μm auranofin completely inhibited LPS-induced NO production (Fig. 5), showing that the major inhibition target is located upstream of MyD88.FIGURE 5Compounds inhibit LPS induced NO production. RAW264.7 cells were seeded and preincubated with increasing concentrations of N-pyrene maleimide (top left), IAANS (top right), JTT-705 (bottom left), or auranofin (bottom right) for 1 h. After LPS stimulation for 16 h, release of NO into the medium was determined using Griess reagent, and the NO amount was calculated from the standard curve.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)FIGURE 6Auranofin and JTT-705 inhibit the MyD88-dependent signaling pathway.

JTT-705 still bound to MD-2C133F but to a significantly lower extent than to the wild type protein (Fig. 7A). To demonstrate that mutagenesis of Cys133 also affects LPS signaling in HEK293 cells, we preincubated recombinant proteins with increasing concentrations of JTT-705. MD-2·JTT-705 or MD-2C133F·JTT-705 complexes were added to HEK293 cells expressing TLR4 and stimulated with LPS. The inhibitory effect of JTT-705 on LPS signaling was only minor when MD-2C133F was applied (Fig. 7B). In the case of WT MD-2, cell activation was reduced by 50% at 15 μm JTT-705, which is also lower than the concentration necessary for inhibition of MyD88-induced activation. This finding confirms that the efficiency of inhibition depends on the reactivity of Cys133 residue with JTT-705. For animal studies, the compound JTT-705 had to be administered to mice mixed with their feed due to its very low water solubility (see “Materials and Methods”). Animals were fed JTT-705-containing mouse pellets for 6 days, and each animal received an estimated dose of 0.6 mg of compound/day. On a body weight basis, this"
https://openalex.org/W1992802441,"ERK3 and ERK4 are atypical MAPKs in which the canonical TXY motif within the activation loop of the classical MAPKs is replaced by SEG. Both ERK3 and ERK4 bind, translocate, and activate the MAPK-activated protein kinase (MK) 5. The classical MAPKs ERK1/2 and p38 interact with downstream MKs (RSK1-3 and MK2-3, respectively) through conserved clusters of acidic amino acids, which constitute the common docking (CD) domain. In contrast to the classical MAPKs, the interaction between ERK3/4 and MK5 is strictly dependent on phosphorylation of the SEG motif of these kinases. Here we report that the conserved CD domain is dispensable for the interaction of ERK3 and ERK4 with MK5. Using peptide overlay assays, we have defined a novel MK5 interaction motif (FRIEDE) within both ERK4 and ERK3 that is essential for binding to the C-terminal region of MK5. This motif is located within the L16 extension lying C-terminal to the CD domain in ERK3 and ERK4 and a single isoleucine to lysine substitution in FRIEDE totally abrogates binding, activation, and translocation of MK5 by both ERK3 and ERK4. These findings are the first to demonstrate binding of a physiological substrate via this region of the L16 loop in a MAPK. Furthermore, the link between activation loop phosphorylation and accessibility of the FRIEDE interaction motif suggests a switch mechanism for these atypical MAPKs in which the phosphorylation status of the activation loop regulates the ability of both ERK3 and ERK4 to bind to a downstream effector."
https://openalex.org/W1963799187,"Streptococcus pyogenes can cause invasive diseases in humans, such as sepsis or necrotizing fasciitis. Among the various M serotypes of group A streptococci (GAS), M3 GAS lacks the major epithelial invasins SfbI/PrtF1 and M1 protein but has a high potential to cause invasive disease. We examined the uptake of M3 GAS into human endothelial cells and identified host signaling factors required to initiate streptococcal uptake. Bacterial uptake is accompanied by local F-actin accumulation and formation of membrane protrusions at the entry site. We found that Src kinases and Rac1 but not phosphatidylinositol 3-kinases (PI3Ks) are essential to mediate S. pyogenes internalization. Pharmacological inhibition of Src activity reduced bacterial uptake and abolished the formation of membrane protrusions and actin accumulation in the vicinity of adherent streptococci. We found that Src kinases are activated in a time-dependent manner in response to M3 GAS. We also demonstrated that PI3K is dispensable for internalization of M3 streptococci and the formation of F-actin accumulations at the entry site. Furthermore, Rac1 was activated in infected cells and accumulated with F-actin in a PI3K-independent manner at bacterial entry sites. Genetic interference with Rac1 function inhibited streptococcal internalization, demonstrating an essential role of Rac1 for the uptake process of streptococci into endothelial cells. In addition, we demonstrated for the first time accumulation of the actin nucleation complex Arp2/3 at the entry port of invading M3 streptococci."

Egg activation refers to the cellular and molecular events that take place immediately following fertilization, transitioning the zygote into embryogenesis. In vertebrates, egg activation encompasses the block to polyspermy and the completion of oocyte meiosis, which is coupled to the extrusion of the second polar body. Interestingly, in all sexually reproducing organisms tested to date the cellular events associated with egg activation are Ca2+-dependent (1Stricker S.A. Dev. Biol. 1999; 211: 157-176Crossref PubMed Scopus (583) Google Scholar). Importantly the Ca2+ signal at fertilization encodes the progression of these cellular events in a defined temporal sequence that ensures a functional egg-to-embryo transition (2Ducibella T. Huneau D. Angelichio E. Xu Z. Schultz R.M. Kopf G.S. Fissore R. Madoux S. Ozil J.P. Dev. Biol. 2002; 250: 280-291Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 3Ozil J.P. Markoulaki S. Toth S. Matson S. Banrezes B.

The first order of business for the fertilized egg is to block polyspermy, which could be lethal to the embryo. This presents a particularly difficult problem for the large Xenopus oocyte. Therefore, this species employs a fast and slow blocks to polyspermy, both of which are Ca2+-dependent (4Machaca K. Qu Z. Kuruma A. Hartzell H.C. McCarty N. Fuller C.M. Calcium Activates Chloride Channels. Academic Press, San Diego2001: 3-39Google Scholar). In addition, the Ca2+ release wave at fertilization releases the metaphase II cytostatic factor-dependent arrest in Xenopus oocytes. As is the case in other vertebrates, Xenopus eggs arrest at metaphase of meiosis II, an event that marks the completion of maturation. Therefore, Ca2+ dynamics at fertilization initiate and temporally encode critical cellular events for the egg-to-embryo transition. Specificity in Ca2+ signaling is encoded to a large extent in the spatial, temporal, and amplitude features of the Ca2+ signal. This endows Ca2+ signaling with its versatility and specificity, where in the same cell Ca2+ signals can mediate distinct cellular responses (5Dolmetsch R.E. Lewis R.S. Goodnow C.C. Healy J.I.

Indeed Ca2+ release from intracellular stores through the IP3 receptor (IP3R) represents the primary source for the initial Ca2+ rise at fertilization in vertebrates (12Miyazaki S. Shirakawa H. Nakada K. Honda Y. Dev. Biol. 1993; 158: 62-78Crossref PubMed Scopus (506) Google Scholar, 13Larabell C. Nuccitelli R. Dev.

The sensitivity of IP3-dependent Ca2+ release is enhanced during maturation (10Machaca K. Dev. Biol. 2004; 275: 170-182Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar, 15Terasaki M. Runft L.L. Hand A.R. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2001; 12: 1103-1116Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar). The IP3R physically clusters during maturation (9El-Jouni W. Jang B. Haun S. Machaca K. Dev. Biol. 2005; 288: 514-525Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar, 16Parys J.B. McPherson S.M. Mathews L. Campbell K.P. Longo F.J. Dev. Biol. 1994; 161: 466-476Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar), and this is associated with functional clustering of elementary Ca2+ release events (10Machaca K. Dev. Biol. 2004; 275: 170-182Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). IP3R clustering is important for the slow and continuous nature of Ca2+ wave propagation in Xenopus eggs (10Machaca K. Dev. Biol. 2004; 275: 170-182Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). In fact the potentiation of IP3-dependent Ca2+ release is a hallmark of Ca2+ signaling differentiation during oocyte maturation in several vertebrate and invertebrate species (17Chiba K. Kado R.T. Jaffe L.A. Dev. Biol. 1990; 140: 300-306Crossref PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar, 18Fujiwara T. Nakada K. Shirakawa H. Miyazaki S. Dev.

An attractive mechanism to explain increased IP3R sensitivity during oocyte maturation is phosphorylation, given the critical role kinase cascades play in the initiation and progression of the meiotic cell cycle. Furthermore, the affinity of the IP3R increases during mitosis apparently due to direct phosphorylation by maturation-promoting factor (MPF) (20Malathi K. Kohyama S. Ho M. Soghoian D. Li X. Silane M.

Immunol. 2005; 175: 6205-6210Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). In contrast, in starfish eggs, although the increase in Ca2+ release was dependent on MPF activation, MPF does not directly phosphorylate the IP3R, but rather it appears to mediate its effect through the actin cytoskeleton (22Santella L. Ercolano E. Lim D. Nusco G.A. Moccia F. Biochem. Soc. Trans. 2003; 31: 79-82Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar, 23Lim D. Ercolano E. Kyozuka K. Nusco G.A. Moccia F. Lange K. Santella L. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 42505-42514Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). More recently, the MAPK cascade has been shown to be important for shaping Ca2+ dynamics in mouse eggs (24Lee B. Vermassen E. Yoon S.Y. Vanderheyden V. Ito J. Alfandari D. De Smedt H. Parys J.B. Fissore R.A. Development. 2006; 133: 4355-4365Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). Together, these results argue that phosphorylation plays an important role in the sensitization of IP3-dependent Ca2+ release during M-phase. Xenopus oocyte maturation is initiated by steroids that appear to act on a cell surface receptor (25Josefsberg Ben-Yehoshua L. Lewellyn A.L. Thomas P. Maller J.L. Mol. Endocrinol. 2007; 21: 664-673Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). An important kinase cascade activated during maturation is the MAPK cascade that is initiated through the accumulation of Mos (Fig. 1A). This cascade culminates in the inhibition of Myt1, which phosphorylates and inhibits MPF. MPF is the key regulator of entry into M-phase and is composed of a Ser/Thr kinase subunit (cdk1) and cyclin B as a regulatory subunit. In addition, activation of Cdc25C is essential for oocyte maturation, because it represents the rate-limiting step in MPF activation (26Perdiguero E. Nebreda A.R. Cell Cycle. 2004; 3: 733-737Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar). Cdc25C is phosphorylated by polo-like kinase through unknown upstream steps. In this work we analyze the functional regulation and phosphorylation pattern of the IP3R during oocyte maturation to better understand the role of cell cycle kinases in modulating IP3-dependent Ca2+ release. A portion of the Xenopus IP3R coupling domain (residues 565–1895) was amplified from a Xenopus oocyte library (N. Garret, Wellcome Trust) and subcloned into the SacII-ClaI sites of the oocyte expression vector pSGEM (M. Hollmann, Max-Planck) (27Villmann C. Bull L. Hollmann M. J. Neurosci. 1997; 17: 7634-7643Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The forward primer inserts a SacII site, an internal ribosomal binding site followed by a start Met and a FLAG tag in-frame upstream of the IP3R coding sequence: TCCCCGCGGGGAACCACCATGGACTACAAGGACGACGACGACAAGGGCTTTATGCAGAAGCAGATTGGTTATGATGTGTTGG. The reverse primer was CCATCGATGGTGCAACAGCCATCACGCCTTCTCC. pSGEM flanks the cDNA with the 5′- and 3′-untranslated regions from the Xenopus globin gene, thus stabilizing the resultant mRNA in the oocyte (42Liman E.R. Tytgat J. Hess P. Neuron. 1992; 9: 861-871Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (979) Google Scholar). T931A, T1136A, and the double mutant were engineered using the QuikChange kit (Stratagene) and sequence-verified. Plasmids were linearized with NheI and transcribed with T7 polymerase using the mMessage mMachine transcription kit (Ambion). Cyclin B1, Mos, and Wee1 RNAs were synthesized from a pXen-GST-Mos, pSP64-cyclinB1xen, and pXen-Wee1 plasmids as previously described (28Sun L. Machaca K. J. Cell Biol. 2004; 165: 63-75Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). Oocytes (150 cells) were subject to immunoprecipitation using custom-made preImmune and immune sera as described below. MPF phosphorylation assays were performed using the SignaTech cdc2 Protein Kinase Assay System (Promega, catalog no. V6430) directly on antigen-antibody complex bound to Protein A/G-agarose beads. The MPF assay consisted of 60 oocytes per reaction containing 0.13 μCi of [γ-32P]ATP, 50 μm ATP, 10 units of Xenopus MPF (Calbiochem, catalog no. 506120) in MPF buffer. Samples were incubated for 1 h at 30 °C, and the reaction was terminated by the addition of SDS loading and boiling. The samples were then separated on polyacrylamide gel, transfer to polyvinylidene difluoride membrane, and analyzed by autoradiography. Western analysis was also performed on the same set of IP samples (five oocytes or eggs/sample). Two dishes of oocytes (>1,000 cells each) were labeled with [32P]orthophosphoric acid (10 μCi/μl, PerkinElmer Life Sciences). Progesterone was added to one dish to induce maturation. After overnight incubation oocytes and eggs were harvested and lysed in IP Lysis buffer (in mm: 30 Hepes, pH 7.5, 100 NaCl, 2 sodium vanadate, 50 β-glycerol phosphate, 10 sodium pyrophosphate, 5 EDTA, 5 EGTA, 1 dithiothreitol, plus protease inhibitors, Mixture III, EMD Bioscience). The lysates were centrifuge five times at 1,000 × g to remove particulates, and Nonidet P-40 was added to the supernatant to a final concentration of 2.5%. The samples were incubated for 2 h with rotation at 4 °C followed by centrifugation at 12,000 × g for 10 min. IPs were performed using custom-made rabbit anti-IP3R antibodies. Protein A/G-agarose beads (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Santa Cruz, CA) were used to precipitate the antigen-antibody complex. The bound agarose beads were washed four times with lysis buffer containing 2.5% Nonidet P-40. SDS loading buffer were added to the beads, boiled for 5 min, separated on SDS-PAGE gel, and analyzed by autoradiography. FLAG-tagged regulatory region of the IP3R was immunoprecipitated using an anti-FLAG antibody (Stratagene) followed by protein G-agarose beads. Immunoprecipitation of the IP3R was confirmed by Western blotting. Custom-made antibodies against the Xenopus type 1 IP3R were generated in rabbits against the C-terminal 19 residues. The specificity of the antibody against the target peptide was confirmed by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. In addition the antibody was validated against commercially available anti-IP3R antibodies (CT-1 and T433 (Upstate)), where commercial antibodies detect the IP3R immunoprecipitated using our custom-made antibody. Our rabbit anti-IP3R antibody (ProteinTech) was used at 1:1000 dilution for Western blots. Phospho-specific antibodies for Thr-931 and Thr-1136 were generated against the following phosphorylated peptides, respectively: N′-C-GGGFLPMT(phos)PMAAPEG and N′-C′AGGADKGET(phos)PGKAKK. Antibodies were affinity-purified against the phosphorylated peptide, and the specificity was confirmed by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay where the antibody detected the phosphorylated but not the native peptide. These phosphospecific antibodies detected immunoprecipitated IP3R in eggs but not oocytes and were used at 1:500 dilution for Western blots. Other commercially purchased antibodies were as follows: Phospho-(Ser/Thr) PKA substrate mAb (Cell Signaling catalog no. 9624), Phospho-(Ser) CDKs substrate Ab (Cell Signaling catalog no. 2324), Phospho-(Thr) MAPK/CDC substrate mAb (Cell Signaling catalog no. 2321), Phospho MAPK mAb (Cell Signaling, catalog no. 9106), Phospho Cdc2 Ab (Cell Signaling, catalog no. 9111), Anti-FLAG® M2 antibody (Stratagene catalog no. 200472), and monoclonal anti-α-tubulin antibody (Sigma catalog no. T9026). For Western blotting lysates or IP samples were separated on 6 or 10% polyacrylamide gels, transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride membrane, and blotted with the primary antibodies. This was followed by the appropriate horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibody (Jackson) and detected by using ECL-Plus (Amersham Biosciences). Western blots were visualized using a StormTM system (Amersham Biosciences). Xenopus oocytes were injected with Oregon Green 1,2-bis(2-aminophenoxy)ethane-N,N,N′,N′-tetraacetic acid tetrakis-1 and caged-IP3 (d-myo-inositol 1,4,5-triphosphate, P4(5)-(1-(2-nitrophenyl)ethyl) ester, tris triethylammonium salt, Molecular Probes). Ca2+ imaging was performed on a Zeiss LSM510 or Olympus Fluoview300 confocal microscope. Because sperm targets the egg's animal hemisphere, all experiments were limited to this pole. The IP3R was immunoprecipitated, re-suspended in SDS NuPAGE LDS Sample buffer, and resolved on a 4–12% gradient NuPAGE gel (Invitrogen). The gel was stained with Simply BlueTM SafeStain according to the manufacturer's instructions. The IP3R band was excised and robotically (Progest, Genomic Solutions, Ann Arbor, MI) digested with trypsin or chymotrypsin using an in-gel digestion protocol using either trypsin or chymotrypsin (29Edmondson R.D. Vondriska T.M. Biederman K.J. Zhang J. Jones R.C. Zheng Y. Allen D.L. Xiu J.X. Cardwell E.M. Pisano M.R. Ping P. Mol. Cell Proteomics. 2002; 1: 421-433Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). The resulting peptide pools were separated by reversed-phase high performance liquid chromatography using a splitless high-performance liquid chromatography system (Nano LC-2D, Eksigent, Dublin, CA). Peptides were loaded onto a 4-mm × 75-μm column packed with C12 resin (Jupiter proteo 4 μm, Phenomenex, Torrance, CA) and eluted using a gradient elution (gradient conditions were 0.1–30% B in 35 min, 30–50% B in 10 min, 50–80% B in 5 min) flowing at 200 nl/min over the analytical column (15 cm × 75 μm packed with the same resin). The column was interfaced to a 30-μm × 3-cm stainless steel emitter (Proxeon, Odense, Denmark) onto which 1.8 kV was applied. The peptides were analyzed by an ion trap (LCQ Deca XP Plus, Thermo, San Jose, CA) using data-dependent acquisition. Each scan cycle consisted of one parent MS scan, which utilized an m/z range of 400–1600 followed by 4 MS/MS scans of the four most intense ions that had not been previously selected for fragmentation. Normalized collision activation energy was set at 35%, and three microscans were summed following automatic-gain-control implementation, which consisted of 5 × 108 ions for MS and 6 × 107 ions for MS/MS. Dynamic exclusion was set for 30 s, ensuring that peptides were only selected once for fragmentation. Data from the MS/MS analysis was searched against the non-redundant NCBI data base for Xenopus laevis proteins using Mascot as the search engine. This process was automated by Mascot Daemon. Peptides were searched with a fixed modification of carbamidomethyl (Cys), and variable modifications of oxidation (Met), phosphorylation of serine or threonine, and phosphorylation of tyrosine. Maximum limit for missed cleavages was set at 2, peptide mass tolerance was set at 2.0 Da, and fragment ion tolerance was set at 0.6 Da. The search results were then parsed into Scaffold (Proteome Software, Portland, OR), which verified peptide identification from Mascot and probabilistically validates these peptide identifications using PeptideProphet (30Keller A. Nesvizhskii A.I. Kolker E. Aebersold R. Anal. Chem. 2002; 74: 5383-5392Crossref PubMed Scopus (3897) Google Scholar) and derives corresponding protein probabilities using ProteinProphet (31Nesvizhskii A.I. Keller A. Kolker E. Aebersold R. Anal. Chem. 2003; 75: 4646-4658Crossref PubMed Scopus (3635) Google Scholar). Candidate phosphopeptides (peptides identified by Mascot as phosphorylated) were all manually verified and annotated to ensure genuineness. The fragment ion data were vigilantly examined to ensure sufficient spectral data (both intact ion series as well as ion series containing the typically observed neutral loss) existed to confirm the localization of the phosphorylation site on the peptides containing multiple potential sites. Several kinase cascades are activated during Xenopus oocyte maturation and regulate critical milestones throughout this complex developmental transition (32Nebreda A.R. Ferby I. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 2000; 12: 666-675Crossref PubMed Scopus (222) Google Scholar). Fig. 1A outlines the salient features of the signal transduction cascade driving oocyte maturation as relevant to this work. We employed functional imaging and biochemical approaches to correlate kinase activation along the oocyte maturation cascade with the sensitivity of IP3-dependent Ca2+ release. For these experiments oocytes were loaded with the Ca2+ sensor Oregon-Green 1,2-bis(2-aminophenoxy)ethane-N,N,N′,N′-tetraacetic acid tetrakis, to assess changes in Ca2+ levels and caged IP3 to allow quantitative IP3 generation based on the duration of the uncaging pulse as previously described (9El-Jouni W. Jang B. Haun S. Machaca K. Dev. Biol. 2005; 288: 514-525Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar, 10Machaca K. Dev. Biol. 2004; 275: 170-182Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). We first assessed the Ca2+ release response to a gradual slow rise in IP3 in a spatially defined location (Fig. 1, B and C). This was accomplished by continuously uncaging IP3 using the near UV 405 nm laser on an LSM510 confocal in line-scan mode (Fig. 1B). In oocytes this protocol produces Ca2+ puffs, which are initial events, followed by Ca2+ oscillations before the Ca2+ signal plateaus (Fig. 1B, Oocyte). After imaging, each cell was lysed to analyze the activation state of both MAPK and MPF. This allowed direct correlation at the single cell level between Ca2+ dynamics and kinases activation. Phospho-specific antibodies were employed to visualize the phosphorylation, and thus activation state, of MAPK (Fig. 1B, arrowhead) and MPF (Fig. 1B, arrow), whereas tubulin was used as the loading control (Fig. 1B, line). Detection of a phosphorylated MAPK band indicates activation. In contrast, phosphorylation at Tyr-15 of MPF inhibits the kinase, and thus MPF activation is indicated by loss of the reactive band using the anti-phospho-Tyr-15 antibody (Fig. 1B, arrow). As oocytes progress through maturation, IP3-dependent Ca2+ release dynamics are altered (Fig. 1, B and C). Two or more hours after progesterone addition oocytes exhibit similar Ca2+ dynamics and were thus pooled for analysis (Fig. 1, B–E, p > 2). The sensitivity of IP3-dependent Ca2+ release is decreased in this population, especially late after progesterone addition (i.e. ≥70% of the cells in the population have undergone germinal vesicle breakdown (GVBD)). This is indicated by the dampened release observed in the representative line scan (Fig. 1B, Prog. Late), the increased percent of non-responding cells (Fig. 1C, p > 2), and the higher percentage of cells that produce only Ca2+ puffs (Fig. 1C, p > 2, Puffs). Therefore, Ca2+ mobilization in oocytes that have initiated maturation, but before GVBD, shifted toward a less responsive mode. In a subset of this population, that is in oocytes 1–2 h before GVBD, MAPK was activated at low levels (Fig. 1B, Prog. Late). At GVBD, when both the MAPK cascade and MPF are activated, typically fewer Ca2+ oscillations were observed (Fig. 1B, GVBD), and a small percentage of cells produced Ca2+ waves without any observable puffs indicating that the sensitivity of IP3-dependent Ca2+ release was enhanced (Fig. 1C). As maturation progressed further, Ca2+ oscillations were gradually inhibited and were absent in fully mature eggs (Fig. 1, B and C). In this experimental paradigm of gradually increasing IP3 levels, three measures of Ca2+ dynamics reflect sensitivity of IP3-dependent Ca2+ release. The amplitude of the initial Ca2+ response (Fig. 1D, 1st Peak) as compared with the maximum response (Fig. 1D, Max), the latency to the initial Ca2+ response (Fig. 1E, Time to 1st Peak), and the percent of cells that produce Ca2+ waves (Fig. 1C). The differential between the amplitude of the initial and maximal Ca2+ signals was pronounced in oocytes and gradually decreased as cells progressed through maturation (Fig. 1D). Functionally this results in the suppression of Ca2+ oscillations (Fig. 1B), which is physiologically significant, because a single sweeping Ca2+ wave is important to trigger and maintain the polyspermy block in eggs (4Machaca K. Qu Z. Kuruma A. Hartzell H.C. McCarty N. Fuller C.M. Calcium Activates Chloride Channels. Academic Press, San Diego2001: 3-39Google Scholar). Surprisingly, however, the latency to the initial response was not statistically different throughout maturation, and even tended to be longer in eggs (Fig. 1E). The reasons for this observation were not clear, but one possibility is that the gradual increase in IP3 levels in eggs resulted in inactivation of the receptor before an observable Ca2+ release was mounted. Mathematical modeling argues that this mechanism explains the shorter puff duration observed in eggs as compared with oocytes (11Ullah G. Jung P. Machaca K. Cell Calcium. 2007; 42: 556-564Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). We then tested the Ca2+ mobilization response throughout maturation using a flash uncaging pulse, to determine the instantaneous Ca2+ response following a step rather than gradual IP3 increase (Fig. 2). For each batch of cells the sub-threshold uncaging pulse duration was empirically determined in oocytes and applied to different stages of maturation. Uncaging caged-fluorescein in oocytes and eggs resulted in similar fluorescence signals (Fig. 2A, inset), showing that light penetrance in the two cell types is comparable. We also confirmed the activation states of MAPK and MPF along the maturation pathway (Fig. 2C). As in Fig. 1 cells were lysed individually after imaging, and MAPK and MPF activation was determined (Fig. 2C). Examples from three individual cells are shown (Fig. 2C). The sensitivity of IP3-dependent Ca2+ release began to increase at the GVBD stage and reached maximal sensitivity in fully mature eggs (Fig. 2, A and B). Similar results were observed in response to a gradual IP3-uncaging protocol in a region of interest (supplemental Fig. S1). Typically, MAPK is activated at low levels 1–2 h before GVBD (Fig. 2C, P3–15h), followed by robust MAPK activation due to a positive feedback loop between the MAPK cascade and MPF (33Machaca K. Haun S. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 38710-38715Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). IP3-dependent Ca2+ release was not sensitized in this population (Fig. 2B, low P-MAPK). This indicates that low MAPK activation is not sufficient to sensitize IP3Rs during maturation. In fact low MAPK activity correlated with decreased IP3-dependent Ca2+ release sensitivity (Fig. 1B, Prog. Late). Together these results show that IP3R sensitization occurs downstream of MPF activation and reaches maximal potentiation in fully mature eggs. An attractive potential mechanism to regulate IP3R sensitivity during oocyte maturation is phosphorylation, especially given the central role of kinase cascades in driving oocyte maturation. To test whether the IP3R is phosphorylated during maturation, oocytes were metabolically labeled with [32P]orthophosphate and either left untreated (oocytes) or matured with progesterone (eggs) (Fig. 3A). Immunoprecipitation of the IP3R shows that it is phosphorylated in eggs but not oocytes (Fig. 3A). Several proteins that coimmunoprecipitate with the IP3R were also phosphorylated in eggs (Fig. 3A, Egg). Stripping and probing the blot with anti-IP3R antibodies confirmed that the IP3R was immunoprecipitated successfully from both cell types (Fig. 3A, WB). Because the increased sensitivity of IP3-dependent Ca2+ release was observed only after MPF activation, we tested whether the IP3R is an MPF substrate. The IP3R was immunoprecipitated from oocytes and incubated in the presence of [γ-32P]ATP and MPF (Fig. 3B). Western blotting (WB) confirmed IP3R pulldown with immune but not pre-immune antibodies, and autoradiography (MPF-P) shows that the IP3R can be phosphorylated by MPF in vitro (Fig. 3B). Other proteins immunoprecipitated with the IP3R represent good substrates for MPF, however, we do not know their identity (Fig. 3B). These data show that the IP3R was phosphorylated in eggs and that it could act as an MPF substrate in vitro. To better define the role of phosphorylation in sensitizing the IP3R, we were interested in mapping the residues phosphorylated during maturation, because this would help identify the kinases responsible and outline possible functional implications based on which domains are phosphorylated. However, this is a daunting task given the large size of the IP3R (2693 residues). We tackled this problem using MS given its built-in high-throughput capabilities. The IP3R was immunoprecipitated fro"

The SK.Pg* catalytic complex binds Pg as a specific substrate and cleaves it into plasmin (Pm), which binds SK to form the SK.Pm complex that propagates Pm generation. Catalytic complex formation is dependent on lysine-binding site (LBS) interactions between a Pg/Pm kringle and the SK COOH-terminal Lys(414). Pg substrate recognition is also LBS-dependent, but the kringle and SK structural element(s) responsible have not been identified. SK mutants lacking Lys(414) with Ala substitutions of charged residues in the SK beta-domain 250-loop were evaluated in kinetic studies that resolved conformational and proteolytic Pg activation. Activation of [Lys]Pg and mini-Pg (containing only kringle 5 of Pg) by SK with Ala substitutions of Arg(253), Lys(256), and Lys(257) showed decreases in the bimolecular rate constant for Pm generation, with nearly total inhibition for the SK Lys(256)/Lys(257) double mutant. Binding of bovine Pg (BPg) to the SK.Pm complex containing fluorescently labeled Pm demonstrated LBS-dependent assembly of a SK.labeled Pm.BPg ternary complex, whereas BPg did not bind to the complex containing the SK Lys(256)/Lys(257) mutant. BPg was activated by SK.Pm with a K(m) indistinguishable from the K(D) for BPg binding to form the ternary complex, whereas the SK Lys(256)/Lys(257) mutant did not support BPg activation. We conclude that SK residues Arg(253), Lys(256), and Lys(257) mediate Pg substrate recognition through kringle 5 of the [Lys]Pg and mini-Pg substrates. A molecular model of the SK.kringle 5 complex identifies the putative interactions involved in LBS-dependent Pg substrate recognition."

Glycine fulfills a dual role in neurotransmission by mediating inhibition through the strychnine-sensitive glycine receptor and excitation as a co-agonist of the NMDA 2The abbreviations used are: NMDAN-methyl-d-aspartic acidPKCprotein kinase CPMAphorbol 12-myristate 13-acetateDATdopamine transporterGFPgreen fluorescent proteinMDCKMadin-Darby canine kidneyNGFRnerve growth factor receptorYFPyellow fluorescent proteinHAhemagglutininUbubiquitinE1ubiquitin-activating enzymeSulfo-NHS-SS-Biotinsulfosuccinimidyl 2-(biotinamido)-ethyl-1,3-dithiopropionate. receptors (1.Betz H.

Although it was initially believed that the concentration of glycine in the synaptic cleft would be sufficient to saturate the glycine sites on NMDA receptors, recent pharmacological and electrophysiological evidence indicates that due to the activity of the GLYT1 (glycine transporter-1) glycine transporter, this is probably not the case. Three isoforms of GLYT1 exist that differ in their NH2-terminal sequence (GLYT1a, GLYT1b, and GLYT1c), and they are strongly expressed in glycinergic areas of the nervous system, predominantly in glial cells (3.Zafra F. Giménez C. IUBMB Life. 2008; 60: 810-817Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). Indeed, mice lacking GLYT1 have impaired glycinergic neurotransmission, which has been attributed to an increase in extracellular glycine close to the strychnine-sensitive glycine receptor (4.Gomeza J. Hülsmann S. Ohno K. Eulenburg V. Szöke K. Richter D. Betz H. Neuron. 2003; 40: 785-796Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (259) Google Scholar). Moreover, GLYT1 has been identified in neuronal elements closely associated with the glutamatergic pathways throughout the brain (5.Cubelos B. Giménez C. Zafra F. Cereb. Cortex. 2005; 15: 448-459Crossref PubMed Scopus (244) Google Scholar, 6.Sur C. Kinney G.G. Curr. Drug Targets. 2007; 8: 643-649Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). GLYT1 is enriched in presynaptic buttons, where it largely co-localizes with the vesicular glutamate transporter vGLUT1. It is also present in the postsynaptic densities of asymmetric synapses, and complexes containing both NMDA receptor and GLYT1 have been shown to exist (5.Cubelos B. Giménez C. Zafra F. Cereb. Cortex. 2005; 15: 448-459Crossref PubMed Scopus (244) Google Scholar). In these postsynaptic sites, the distribution of GLYT1 is partially controlled through its interaction with the scaffolding protein PSD-95 (7.Cubelos B. González-González I.M. Giménez C. Zafra F. J. Neurochem. 2005; 95: 1047-1058Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). Accordingly, GLYT1 is believed to play a role in controlling the concentration of glycine in the microenvironment around the NMDA receptor. Indeed, functional studies have shown that a specific GLYT1 inhibitor, N-[3-(4′-fluorophenyl)-3-(4′-phenylphenoxy)propyl]sarcosine, potentiates NMDA-mediated responses in vitro and in vivo (8.Bergeron R.

The potential role of GLYT1 in glutamatergic neurotransmission has also been confirmed in heterozygous Glyt1+/− animals that express only 50% of the normal levels of GLYT1 as well as when GLYT1 expression is disturbed in forebrain neurons. In these animals, hippocampal NMDA receptor function is enhanced, and the mice appear to display better memory retention than wild type mice (11.Yee B.K. Balic E. Singer P. Schwerdel C. Grampp T.

The mechanisms responsible for the insertion of GLYT1 into glutamatergic synapses are unknown. However, recent studies indicate that the movement of transporters within the cell is highly organized and that a number of ancillary proteins control their intracellular trafficking by interacting with targeting motifs in the transporter. Indeed, like other neurotransmitter transporters, GLYT1 is asymmetrically distributed in polarized cells (14.Poyatos I. Ruberti F. Martínez-Maza R. Giménez C. Dotti C.G. Zafra F. Mol. Cell Neurosci. 2000; 15: 99-111Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar, 15.Melikian H.E. Buckley K.M. J. Neurosci. 1999; 19: 7699-7710Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The asymmetric distribution of sodium-dependent neurotransmitter transporters (NSS) requires a number of steps that commence with their efficient exit from the endoplasmic reticulum. This is followed by sorting processes in the Golgi complex, insertion into the plasma membrane, and the retention of the transporter at functional synaptic sites. Moreover, the amount of transporter in the plasma membrane is also regulated by endocytosis and recycling mechanisms. Like several other members of the NSS family, GLYT1 is subjected to regulation by protein kinase C. Activation of PKC by phorbol esters down-regulates GLYT1, which is endocytosed from the plasma membrane to intracellular compartments in several cell lines (16.Gomeza J. Zafra F. Olivares L. Giménez C. Aragón C. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1995; 1233: 41-46Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar, 17.Morioka N. Abdin J.M. Morita K. Kitayama T. Nakata Y. Dohi T. Neurochem.

For years, the molecular mechanisms that mediate phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate (PMA)-stimulated endocytosis of the NSS family members have remained elusive. However, recent evidence obtained for the dopamine transporter (DAT) has revealed the importance of ubiquitination of DAT for its endocytosis (19.Miranda M. Sorkin A. Mol. Interv. 2007; 7: 157-167Crossref PubMed Scopus (173) Google Scholar). DAT is ubiquitinated by the Nedd4-2 ligase at several intracellular lysines. Indeed, mutation of these lysines abolished both ubiquitination and phorbol ester-stimulated endocytosis, indicating that the associated ubiquitin molecules serve as a platform to recruit endocytotic adaptors (20.Sorkina T. Hoover B.R. Zahniser N.R. Sorkin A. Traffic. 2005; 6: 157-170Crossref PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar, 21.Sorkina T. Miranda M. Dionne K.R. Hoover B.R. Zahniser N.R. Sorkin A. J.

Chem. 2005; 280: 35617-35624Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar). Ubiquitination has also been implicated in the endocytosis of other membrane proteins, including the main transporter for glutamate, GLT1, and the system A transporter SNAT2 (24.Sheldon A.L.

Glia. 2008; 56: 963-974Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). Ubiquitin coupling can involve either mono- or polyubiquitination. Monoubiquitination occurs when a single ubiquitin molecule is coupled to one or more lysine residues on a target protein, such that the final stoichiometry is one ubiquitin per lysine. Polyubiquitination refers to the coupling of a chain of ubiquitins to a lysine on the target protein, with a final stoichiometry of four or more ubiquitins per lysine. Whereas monoubiquitinated proteins are degraded in lysosomes, polyubiquitinated proteins are recognized by and subsequently degraded by the 26 S proteasome (27.Hershko A. Ciechanover A. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1998; 67: 425-479Crossref PubMed Scopus (6959) Google Scholar). In this study, we show that GLYT1b is endocytosed through a clathrin-dependent mechanism, a process that is accelerated by phorbol esters. Through a mutational analysis, we have identified a lysine residue in the COOH-terminal tail of the protein as the major determinant for GLYT1b internalization through both constitutive and PMA-stimulated pathways. Ubiquitination GLYT1b is stimulated by PMA, a finding compatible with ubiquitin being the platform on which the clathrin network is assembled. The [3H]glycine, protein standards for SDS-PAGE (Rainbow markers), and the ECL Western blotting detection reagents were all obtained from Amersham Biosciences.

All other chemicals were obtained from Sigma. MDCK cells (American Type Culture Collection) were grown in high glucose Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum at 37 °C and in an atmosphere of 5% CO2. Transient expression in MDCK cells was achieved using Lipofectamine 2000 according to the manufacturer's instructions. The cells were incubated for 48 h at 37 °C and then analyzed biochemically or by immunofluorescence and/or in transport assays. The various GLYT1 mutants used in this study were prepared using the rat GLYT1b cDNA (7.Cubelos B. González-González I.M. Giménez C. Zafra F. J. Neurochem. 2005; 95: 1047-1058Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar) as a template and the QuikChangeTM site-directed mutagenesis kit, according to the manufacturer's instructions. Previously, an HA tag was included in the NH2 terminus of the transporter by PCR or the YFP in the COOH terminus, as described previously (28.Fernández-Sánchez E. Díez-Guerra F.J. Cubelos B. Giménez C. Zafra F. Biochem. J. 2008; 409: 669-681Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). The inclusion of these tags had no effect either on the activity or on the subcellular distribution of the transporter. All of the mutations were confirmed by sequencing of the clones. [3H]Glycine transport in transfected cells was measured as described previously (29.Olivares L. Aragón C. Giménez C. Zafra F. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 9437-9442Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). Protein concentrations were determined with the Bio-Rad protein determination kit and using bovine serum albumin as the standard. Cells were plated at 50% confluence in 60-mm cell culture plates and transfected as indicated above. After 2 days, the cell surface proteins were labeled with the non-permeable sulfo-NHS-SS-biotin reagent as described previously (28.Fernández-Sánchez E. Díez-Guerra F.J. Cubelos B. Giménez C. Zafra F. Biochem. J. 2008; 409: 669-681Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). MDCK cells were grown in p100 dishes, and they were then transfected with expression vectors for GLYT1b-YFP and His-Ub. Two days later, the cells were lysed in 2 ml of buffer (6 m guanidium HCl, 0.1 m Na2HPO4/NaH2PO4, pH 8.0, 5 mm imidazole), sonicated for 2 min, and incubated with 70 μl of Ni2+-nitrilotriacetic acid-agarose beads for 4 h at room temperature with rotatory agitation. The beads were collected by mild centrifugation and washed exhaustively with the sequential addition of 1) 340 μl of 6 m guanidium HCl 0.1 m sodium phosphate, pH 8.0; 2) 700 μl of 6 m guanidium HCl, 0.1 m sodium phosphate, pH 5.8; 3) 340 μl of 6 m guanidium-HCl, 0.1 m sodium phosphate, pH 8.0; 4) 700 μl of 1:1 6 m guanidium HCl, 0.1 m sodium phosphate, pH 8.0, 50 mm sodium phosphate, 100 mm KCl, 20% glycerol, 0.2% Nonidet P-40; 5) 700 μl of 1:3 6 m guanidium HCl, 0.1 m sodium phosphate, pH 8.0, 50 mm sodium phosphate, 100 mm KCl, 20% glycerol, 0.2% Nonidet P-40; 6) 700 μl of 50 mm sodium phosphate, 100 mm KCl, 20% glycerol, 0.2% Nonidet P-40; and 7) the last solution with 10 mm imidazole. Finally, the protein was eluted with 30 μl of the final wash solution containing 500 mm imidazole, and the proteins recovered were analyzed by SDS-PAGE and immunoblotting. SDS-PAGE was carried out on 7.5% polyacrylamide gels in the presence of 2-mercaptoethanol. After electrophoresis, the protein samples were transferred to a nitrocellulose membrane, as described previously (28.Fernández-Sánchez E. Díez-Guerra F.J. Cubelos B. Giménez C. Zafra F. Biochem. J. 2008; 409: 669-681Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). The blot was then probed overnight at 4 °C with the primary antibody (anti-HA or anti-ubiquitin), which was then detected after washing with an anti-mouse IgG peroxidase-linked secondary antibody. The labeled bands were visualized by ECL and quantified by densitometry (Molecular Dynamics ImageQuant version 3.0). MDCK cells grown on glass coverslips were transfected with the corresponding expression vectors using Lipofectamine 2000, according to the manufacturer's instructions. Immunostaining was performed as described previously (26.González-González I.M. García-Tardón N. Giménez C. Zafra F. Glia. 2008; 56: 963-974Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). Antibody staining was visualized, and the images were captured on confocal microradiance equipment (Bio-Rad) coupled to an Axioscop2 microscope (Carl Zeiss, Jena, Germany). To study the endocytosis of GLYT1b, we mainly used the MDCK cell line in which the transfected transporter is efficiently exported to the cell surface, thereby avoiding any interference of the intracellular biosynthetic intermediates in the microscopy analysis (Fig. 1A). The presence of GLYT1b in the cell surface was confirmed in preliminary experiments by measuring [3H]glycine uptake in transfected cells. This localization is also supported (with the limitations imposed by the resolution limit of the confocal microscope) by colocalization of this transporter with the β-subunit of the Na+K+-ATPase, a marker of the plasma membrane. To more rapidly detect the protein, a YFP-tagged construct was used, although similar results were obtained with the HA-tagged GLYT1b or the untagged transporter (compare Fig. 1 with Fig. 4D) (data not shown). A common technique to investigate the constitutive endocytosis of membrane proteins consists of blocking protein recycling to the plasma membrane with the carboxylic ionophore monensin (20.Sorkina T. Hoover B.R. Zahniser N.R. Sorkin A. Traffic. 2005; 6: 157-170Crossref PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar, 30.Potau N. Bailey A.C. Roach E. Williams J.A. Goldfine I.D.

González M.I. Robinson M.B. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 34505-34513Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar). This treatment inhibits transport through acidic endosomes and, consequently, the recycling of proteins to the plasma membrane, promoting the accumulation of the endocytosed protein in endosomes. Exposing MDCK cells transiently transfected with GLYT1b-YFP to a non-toxic concentration of monensin (10 μm) promoted the accumulation of the transporter in intracellular vesicular structures in conjunction with a decrease in the amount of the transporter at the cell surface (Fig. 1B). Similarly, treatment of MDCK cells with the protein kinase C activator PMA induced the accumulation of GLYT1b-YFP in vesicles concomitant with a reduction in the expression of this protein in the plasma membrane region (Fig. 1C). Indeed, simultaneous exposure of the cells to both PMA and monensin further increased the intracellular accumulation of GLYT1b-YFP (Fig. 1D). The loss of functional GLYT1b from the surface of cells exposed to monensin- and PMA was confirmed by assessing the [3H]glycine uptake in MDCK cells transfected with GLYT1b (Fig. 2A). When compared with untreated controls, a 30-min exposure to monensin produced a 49% reduction in glycine uptake, measured over 10 min, whereas PMA induced a 54% reduction. Simultaneous exposure to both reagents further reduced uptake up to 79%. Nevertheless, it should be noted that a fraction of the measured effect of monensin on glycine uptake might be due to an indirect disruption of the sodium gradients. These experiments suggested that there was a constitutive pathway to remove GLYT1b from the cell surface to the intracellular compartment (visualized only in the presence of monensin), which was accelerated by exposure to PMA. Alternatively, PMA might inhibit the insertion of the transporter into the membrane. To investigate whether the internalized protein was targeted for degradation or if it was recycled to the cell surface, we analyzed the stability of the protein in these cells. Accordingly, we quantified the amount GLYT1b in the cell extracts when protein synthesis was blocked with cycloheximide, either in the presence or absence of PMA (Fig. 2B). These results revealed that in the absence of PMA, the protein was quite stable, and after 6 h, the amount of GLYT1b in the cells decreased by only 5% (Fig. 2C). Exposure to PMA accelerated the degradation of GLYT1b, and after 6 h, the amount of this protein had fallen by 42% (Fig. 2C). In transfected cells treated with monensin or with PMA, a significant pool of the intracellular GLYT1b-YFP co-localized with a marker of the early/recycling endosome, Texas Red-transferrin (not shown), as also occurred when the cells were exposed to both compounds together (Fig. S1). Accordingly, these treatments appeared to promote the accumulation of GLYT1b-YFP in the early and/or recycling endosome. Because the aforementioned immunofluorescence and transport assays reflect the steady state, the decrease in transporter at the plasma membrane and the concomitant accumulation in intracellular vesicles might be a consequence of the slower insertion of the transporter into the plasma membrane rather than an acceleration of endocytosis. To directly measure the internalization of GLYT1b from the plasma membrane, we first introduced an extracellular epitope into GLYT1b as previously reported for similar proteins (21.Sorkina T. Miranda M. Dionne K.R. Hoover B.R. Zahniser N.R. Sorkin A. J. Neurosci. 2006; 26: 8195-8205Crossref PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar), but this transporter proved to be inactive. As an alternative approach, we generated a chimeric protein that consisted of the extracellular and transmembrane domains of the p75 NGFR fused to the NH2 terminus of GLYT1b (named NG1wt; scheme in Fig. 3A). This protein was expressed at the cell surface, and it was fully functional in glycine transport assays, indicating that the GLYT1b part of the chimera was correctly folded (data not shown). Prior to performing the endocytosis assays, the chimera could be labeled at the cell surface of living cells (Fig. 3B). To that end, intracellular trafficking was blocked by maintaining the cells at 4 °C, and the chimera at the membrane was then incubated with an antibody against the extracellular domain of NFGR and a fluorescent secondary antibody (Fig. 3, A and B). When trafficking was restored at 37 °C, the labeled NG1wt chimera was seen to internalize. Thus, after 15 min at 37 °C, a number of intracellular vesicles could already be detected (arrows in Fig. 3C), and by 30 min, most of the labeled protein was in these intracellular vesicles (constitutive endocytosis) (Fig. 3D). To investigate whether PMA accelerated the endocytosis of NG1wt, the cells were exposed to this drug for 15 min, conditions in which the chimera was completely internalized (constitutive plus regulated endocytosis) (Fig. 3E). The vesicles with the chimera also co-stained with transferrin in a double labeling endocytosis assay either under constitutive endocytosis or after the PMA treatment (Fig. S2), suggesting that NG1wt and GLYT1b-YFP use the same endocytotic pathway for recycling through the endosomes. To determine whether this internalization was clathrin-dependent, endocytosis of the NG1wt was measured in the presence of hypertonic sucrose. This treatment completely suppressed endocytosis of the chimera either in the presence (Fig. 3F) or absence of PMA (Fig. 3G). Moreover, the endocytosis of HA-tagged GLYT1b was also dependent on dynamin 2, since the dominant negative mutant of this protein (GFP-tagged mutant K44A) suppressed the endocytosis of HA-GLYT1b in MDCK cells treated with monensin (not shown), with PMA (not shown), or with PMA and monensin simultaneously (Fig. 4, A–C). By contrast, wild-type dynamin 2 (GFP tagged) did not affect endocytosis (Fig. 4, D–F). PMA- and monensin-promoted internalization of HA-GLYT1b was also blocked in cells transfected with a dominant negative construct of Eps15 (34.Benmerah A. Bayrou M. Cerf-Bensussan N. Dautry-Varsat A. J. Cell Sci. 1999; 112: 1303-1311Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), another component of clathrin-coated pits (which was GFP-tagged and carried a deletion in residues 95–295) (G-EPS-Δ in Fig. 4, G–I). A quantitative estimate of the effect of the dynamin 2 dominant negative construct on the PMA-regulated endocytosis was obtained by biotinylation of HA-GLYT1b remaining on the cell surface after the treatment (Fig. 4, J and K). PMA reduced the amount of cell surface transporter by 60–70% in controls, whereas the reduction was lower than 10% in the presence of Dyn2 K44A (Fig. 4K). Further evidence for the involvement of the clathrin-dependent endocytosis was obtained by microscopy analysis of YFP-tagged GLYT1b. Thus, hypertonic sucrose treatment largely abolished the internalization of GLYT1b-YFP in transfected MDCK cells in response to either monensin (Fig. 5, A and B) or PMA (Fig. 5, C and D), and few intracellular vesicles were observed after these treatments. Together, these results indicate that GLYT1b underwent active turnover from the plasma membrane to the recycling endosome, a process that was accelerated by activation of the protein kinase C. Moreover, the data support a major contribution of the clathrin-dependent pathway to both the constitutive and the regulated endocytosis of GLYT1b.FIGURE 4PMA and monensin promote the internalization of GLYT1 through the dynamin 2-clathrin pathway. MDCK cells were transfected with HA-GLYT1b (HA-G1 wt) plus GFP-dynamin 2 mutant K44A (G-K44A) (A–C), HA-GLYT1b plus GFP-dynamin 2 (G-Dyn) (D–F), or HA-GLYT1b plus GFP-EPS15Δ (G-EPS-Δ) (G–I). Two days after transfection, they were exposed to PMA and monensin, as indicated in the legend to Fig. 1.

https://openalex.org/W2012670303,"Nitric-oxide synthases (NOSs) are calmodulin-dependent flavoheme enzymes that oxidize l-Arg to nitric oxide (NO) and l-citrulline. Their catalytic behaviors are complex and are determined by their rates of heme reduction (kr), ferric heme-NO dissociation (kd), and ferrous heme-NO oxidation (kox). We found that point mutation (E762N) of a conserved residue on the enzyme's FMN subdomain caused the NO synthesis activity to double compared with wild type nNOS. However, in the absence of l-Arg, NADPH oxidation rates suggested that electron flux through the heme was slower in E762N nNOS, and this correlated with the mutant having a 60% slower kr. During NO synthesis, little heme-NO complex accumulated in the mutant, compared with ∼50–70% of the wild-type nNOS accumulating as this complex. This suggested that the E762N nNOS is hyperactive because it minimizes buildup of an inactive ferrous heme-NO complex during NO synthesis. Indeed, we found that kox was 2 times faster in the E762N mutant than in wild-type nNOS. The mutational effect on kox was independent of calmodulin. Computer simulation and experimental measures both indicated that the slower kr and faster kox of E762N nNOS combine to lower its apparent Km,O2 for NO synthesis by at least 5-fold, which in turn increases its V/Km value and enables it to be hyperactive in steady-state NO synthesis.

In the current post-genomic era, large scale efforts are underway to study the emerging proteome. Because of their ability to bind their respective targets with extremely high specificity, antibodies are essential tools in this endeavor. In fact, non-profit organizations like the European “ProteomeBinders” Consortium (1Taussig M.J. Stoevesandt O. Borrebaeck C.A. Bradbury A.R. Cahill D. Cambillau C. de Daruvar A. Dübel S. Eichler J.

To regulate their function, many proteins are altered after their initial synthesis. Because such post-translational modifications change the physicochemical properties of a given protein, this further increases the complexity of the proteome. Therefore, the true challenge is to have not only all-inclusive antibody libraries but also to assemble collections of sensors, which specifically detect post-translational changes. One of the best studied modifications after polypeptide synthesis is reversible protein phosphorylation through the action of specific kinases and phosphatases. A plethora of cellular processes hinges upon the correct phosphorylation state of key regulators (3Manning G. Whyte D.B. Martinez R. Hunter T. Sudarsanam S. Science. 2002; 298: 1912-1934Crossref PubMed Scopus (6257) Google Scholar), and errors may result in cell death or malignancy (4Johnson L. Biochem. Soc. Trans. 2007; 35: 7-11Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). It is therefore not surprising that protein phosphorylation represents a very active area of research in the quest for new therapeutic cancer targets (5Ventura J.J. Nebreda A.R. Clin. Transl. Oncol. 2006; 8: 153-160Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). Phosphospecific antibodies, first described over 25 years ago (6Ross A.H. Baltimore D. Eisen H.N.

Their production, however, is relatively costly and time consuming. In our laboratory we have succeeded in obtaining highly functional, conformation-specific recombinant antibodies using the method of phage display (9Dimitrov A. Quesnoit M. Moutel S. Cantaloube I. Poüs C. Perez F. Science. 2008; 322: 1353-1356Crossref PubMed Scopus (188) Google Scholar, 10Nizak C. Monier S. del Nery E. Moutel S. Goud B. Perez F.

This not only allowed us to follow the fate of proteins upon activation but also demonstrated that the diversity of available recombinant antibody libraries is sufficiently broad. We thus decided to use a similar approach for the selection of phosphospecific antibodies. We chose GRASP65 as the antigen, the predominant phosphoprotein of mitotic Golgi membranes (11Wang Y. Seemann J. Pypaert M. Shorter J. Warren G. EMBO J. 2003; 22: 3279-3290Crossref PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar). Careful studies have mapped several phospho-residues of this structural Golgi protein, and phosphospecific antibodies have been generated using classical methods (12Wang Y. Satoh A. Warren G. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 4921-4928Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar, 13Preisinger C. Körner R. Wind M. Lehmann W.D. Kopajtich R. Barr F.A.

This study describes a novel approach, which allowed the direct selection and characterization of three distinct and highly functional monoclonal phosphospecific antibodies. Poly-His-tagged full-length rat GRASP65 was expressed in Escherichia coli and purified on Ni-NTA 6The abbreviations used are: Ni-NTAnickel-nitrilotriacetic acidscFvsingle chain variable fragmenthhuman. beads as described (12Wang Y.

The still bound protein was enzymatically phosphorylated by incubating it at 37 °C with mitotic cell extract prepared as described before (15Rabouille C. Misteli T. Watson R. Warren G. J. Cell Biol. 1995; 129: 605-618Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar). After washing six times, the protein was eluted with a 200 mm imidazole-containing buffer followed by dialysis in phosphate-buffered saline, 20 mm β-glycerol phosphate. nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid single chain variable fragment human. Successful modification was confirmed using the mobility shift assay described before (11Wang Y. Seemann J. Pypaert M. Shorter J. Warren G. EMBO J. 2003; 22: 3279-3290Crossref PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar). Prior to phage display, the antigen was biotinylated using EZ-Link maleimide PEO2-biotin (Pierce). The Griffin.1 library protocol was used with modifications as published before (16Griffiths A.D. Williams S.C. Hartley O. Tomlinson I.M. Waterhouse P. Crosby W.L. Kontermann R.E. Jones P.T. Low N.M. Allison T.J. et al.EMBO J. 1994; 13: 3245-3260Crossref PubMed Scopus (877) Google Scholar, 17Nizak C. Martin-Lluesma S. Moutel S. Roux A. Kreis T.E. Goud B. Perez F. Traffic. 2003; 4: 739-753Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). After three rounds of affinity selection, 80 and 96 clones, respectively, were randomly selected and analyzed using two approaches. First, clones were analyzed directly by immunofluorescence using scFv-containing bacterial supernatants and HeLa cells transfected with rat GRASP65-GFP or nontransfected NRK cells. From all positive clones (34 in total) plasmids were extracted, and the scFv-coding region was sequenced. In the second approach, clones were first screened for the presence of antibodies by PCR using the primers 5′-CA GGA AAC AGC TAT GAC-3′ and 5′-TGA ATT TTC TGT ATG AGG-3′. Amplified products were cleaned using a 96-well format kit (Machery-Nagel) and then sequenced. Known and duplicate scFvs were discarded. The remaining unique positive clones were subcloned into an Fc-containing mammalian expression vector (see above). Subsequently produced full antibodies were characterized by immunofluorescence using NRK cells. For the postfixation treatment with λ-phosphatase (New England Biolabs), cells were fixed in paraformaldehyde and permeabilized with Triton X-100. After washing in phosphate-buffered saline, cells were subsequently incubated for 1 h at 30 °C in the presence of the enzyme in TET buffer (50 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 0.1 mm EDTA, 0.01% Triton X-100, 2 mm MnCl2) before immunofluorescence staining. For epitope mapping, purified His-tagged GRASP65 full-length proteins (wild type and various mutants mA, mB, mC, mD, mE, mF, mG, mH, mI, and mJ, where known/potential phosphorylation sites had been mutated to alanines) were incubated with mitotic or interphase cytosol at 37 °C for 1 h and then were further subjected to one round of purification with Ni-NTA beads. The eluates were resolved with SDS-PAGE and probed with the indicated antibodies on Western blot. For more detailed “Experimental Procedures,” see supplemental material. Classical methods to obtain phosphospecific antibodies require the design and subsequent synthesis of highly specific short phosphopeptides, which are ultimately used for animal immunization. In stark contrast, in our in vitro approach, the full-length protein can be used. In a first step, rodent GRASP65 fused to a polyhistidine tag was produced in bacteria. It was next purified on Ni-NTA resin and then directly phosphorylated by exposing it to kinase-containing mitotic cell extract, prepared as described before (15Rabouille C. Misteli T. Watson R. Warren G. J. Cell Biol. 1995; 129: 605-618Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar). Finally, the now enzymatically phosphorylated full-length antigen was eluted. Prior to antibody selection, successful modification was confirmed using a mobility shift assay (11Wang Y. Seemann J. Pypaert M. Shorter J. Warren G. EMBO J. 2003; 22: 3279-3290Crossref PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar) as shown in Fig. 1A. Using the phosphorylated full-length GRASP65 protein as antigen (immobilized on magnetic beads), scFv antibodies were selected from a semi-synthetic phagemid library by using a protocol essentially as described before (17Nizak C. Martin-Lluesma S. Moutel S. Roux A. Kreis T.E. Goud B. Perez F. Traffic. 2003; 4: 739-753Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). Briefly, several rounds of affinity selection and amplification were performed. After the third round, randomly picked clones were analyzed by testing bacterially produced scFvs through immunofluorescence on GRASP65-overexpressing mammalian cells. Additionally, unique scFvs were identified using up-front DNA sequencing directly from bacterial colonies followed by immunofluorescence. Combining the two approaches, three distinct antibodies, R3F2, RB7, and R3G3, were retained for further analysis. R3F2 was the most abundant scFv antibody, representing ∼15% of all clones, whereas the other two were each retrieved only once. Prior to further characterization, they were subcloned into a human Fc domain containing vector as described before (18Moutel S. El Marjou A. Vielemeyer O. Nizak C. Benaroch P. Dübel S. Perez F. BMC Biotechnol. 2009; 9: 14Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar), thus generating dimeric antibodies (hR3F2, hRB7, and hR3G3) with enhanced avidity and greater ease of use. In this format, all three antibodies clearly labeled perinuclear Golgi-like structures also of nontransfected cells (Fig. 1B). Furthermore, they easily detected bacterially produced rat GRASP65 on immunoblot. However, this was the case only if the antigen had first been exposed to mammalian cell extract (Fig. 1B). We noticed that hR3F2 and hRB7, when used for immunofluorescence, labeled only a subset of cells. Detailed analysis revealed Golgi membrane staining exclusively in dividing cells (supplemental Figs. 1 and 2). Because phosphorylation of GRASP65 mostly takes place at the onset of mitosis (11Wang Y. Seemann J. Pypaert M. Shorter J. Warren G. EMBO J. 2003; 22: 3279-3290Crossref PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar, 13Preisinger C. Körner R. Wind M. Lehmann W.D. Kopajtich R. Barr F.A. EMBO J. 2005; 24: 753-765Crossref PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar), this strongly suggested recognition of an epitope modified by a mitotic kinase. In contrast, hR3G3 labeled intracellular structures of all cells, although staining of mitotic cells was more pronounced. This implied binding of this third scFv to either a nonmodified residue or to an epitope modified by both interphase and mitotic kinases. In co-immunofluorescence experiments, the antibody labeling of all three scFvs strongly overlapped with that of other Golgi markers, including GRASP65, detected by a monoclonal antibody named 7E10 (19Shorter J. Watson R. Giannakou M.E. Clarke M. Warren G. Barr F.A. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 4949-4960Crossref PubMed Scopus (256) Google Scholar). All three selected antibodies readily recognized overexpressed GRASP65, although none bound to overexpressed GRASP55, which is closely related to GRASP65. Protein expression knockdown with GRASP65-specific small interfering RNA led to a loss of immunofluorescence signal (data not shown). All three antibodies, although readily staining cells of rodent origin, never decorated human cells. Species specificity was confirmed through immunofluorescence analysis of a mixed HeLa cell population, where cells stably expressing rat GRASP65 were mixed with wild type HeLa cells. All three antibodies bound the recombinant rodent protein, whereas nontransfected cells were never stained (supplemental Fig. 3). Our immunofluorescence and immunoblot data (Fig. 1B) suggested that all three antibodies would specifically recognize phospho-epitopes. To confirm this, FR3T3 cells were fixed, permeabilized, and incubated with a broad-acting λ-phosphatase to dephosphorylate cellular proteins. Subsequent immunofluorescence analysis showed loss of labeling by all three selected antibodies, whereas staining with nonphosphospecific antibodies was not affected (Fig. 1C and supplemental Fig. 4). Furthermore, a GRASP65 mutant, in which eight known/putative phospho-residues had been replaced by alanines, was no longer recognized by any of the three antibodies. This not only confirmed the λ-phosphatase experiment but also suggested that the antibody epitopes would be found among those eight residues. In a last set of experiments, epitope mapping for all three phosphospecific antibodies was performed through immunoblotting and the use of a set of GRASP65 mutants with substitutions of known/putative phosphoamino acids (Fig. 2A). For hR3F2, phosphoserine at position 376 was found as the epitope because the antibody failed to recognize any construct in which this residue had been mutated (Fig. 2, B–E, mC, mE, mF, mG, and mI). The second mitosis-specific antibody, hRB7, displayed an identical pattern (Fig. 2, D and E), thus representing a distinct second phosphorylation sensor against the same epitope. Previously, it has been shown that Ser(P)-376 is modified by the mitotic kinase Cdk1-cyclin B, and polyclonal phosphospecific antibodies have generated a staining pattern very similar to that seen with our selected hR3F2 and hRB7 (13Preisinger C. Körner R. Wind M. Lehmann W.D. Kopajtich R. Barr F.A. EMBO J. 2005; 24: 753-765Crossref PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar). Finally, epitope mapping was also performed for the third antibody, hR3G3. Analysis of binding patterns of this scFv to the different mutant constructs enabled identification of Ser(P)-277 as the target of the antibody (Fig. 2, B and C, mB). This finding is again in agreement with published data; it has been shown that this serine residue at position 277 is phosphorylated in both interphase and during mitosis by the action of two distinct kinases (14Yoshimura S. Yoshioka K. Barr F.A. Lowe M. Nakayama K. Ohkuma S. Nakamura N. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 23048-23056Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). This work describes a novel antibody selection approach where the antigen is prepared by enzymatically phosphorylating the full-length target protein and where the antibodies are then subsequently obtained by utilizing a fully in vitro affinity-based selection process. Using the example of GRASP65, a well studied Golgi phosphoprotein, we show that highly functional conformation-specific sensors can be obtained; in one screen three distinct scFvs against two different phospho-epitopes were found and subsequently characterized. Our method has several inherent advantages over animal-based techniques (schematically depicted in Fig. 3). First, the in vitro approach requires less time and resources. It allows skipping the steps of selection, synthesis, and injection of short synthetic phosphopeptides as antigen usually needed for the production of phosphospecific antibodies and uses the full-length protein directly during the antibody selection process. Classical methods depend on a robust immune response by the mammalian host and entail a fair amount of animal experimentation, including the need for repeated immunizations often with multiple different antigens. Thus, routinely milligram quantities of several different phosphopeptides and a significant time investment are required because either purification of the obtained serum to remove nonspecific binders or, in case of classic monoclonal antibodies, screening of a large number of hybridoma clones are necessary. In our animal-free method, microgram amounts of the bacterially produced antigen are sufficient, and high quality scFv antibodies can be obtained in a few days fully in vitro. Successful antibody selection is independent of the recognition of the target protein by the immune system, and the selected antibodies can be analyzed at the molecular level because their encoding nucleotide sequences are readily available. An even more distinct advantage of our method, however, lies in the fact that there is no necessity to determine the phospho-residue composition of the protein of interest prior to antibody production. Because the entire selection process occurs in vitro, events activated after the injection of animals, such as protein degradation, dephosphorylation, and antigen processing, are all circumvented. The entire full-length protein prepared and enzymatically modified under quasi-physiologic conditions can thus be used directly as the antigen. This way, in a single phage display screen, multiple phosphospecific antibodies targeted at more than one phospho-epitope can be selected as evidenced by the present study. Furthermore, our approach may favor the selection of antibodies against the major phosphorylation site(s) of a given antigen. Indeed, two of the selected scFvs were found to bind one and the same residue, and one of them (R3F2) was by far the most abundant antibody found in the screen. Their target residue, Ser(P)-376, represents one of the key phospho-residues on GRASP65 (13Preisinger C. Körner R. Wind M. Lehmann W.D. Kopajtich R. Barr F.A. EMBO J. 2005; 24: 753-765Crossref PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar). Intriguingly, no nonphosphospecific antibodies were obtained using our method. Although this seems to be a paradox, previous work in our laboratory has similarly led to the selection of scFvs, which exclusively bind active domains. For instance, only antibodies specifically recognizing the GTP-bound form were obtained when the small GTPases Rab6 (10Nizak C. Monier S. del Nery E. Moutel S. Goud B. Perez F. Science. 2003; 300: 984-987Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar) and Rab15 were used as antigens. Upon activation through GTP loading (or analogously through phosphorylation), new protein-protein interaction domains are formed on the surface of the molecule. In contrast to animal-based approaches, the in vitro selection process relies on the recognition of three-dimensional rather than linear epitopes and is thus biased toward these interaction domains because they represent ideal binding sites for antibodies. Altogether this is yet another argument in favor of our approach because it may more efficiently yield highly functional conformation sensors and help determine the major phosphorylation site of a given protein. Finally, our approach benefits from inherent advantages of the recombinant approach. Selected antibody clones can be stored as plasmids and at a fraction of the cost, which all but eliminates the risk of losing a clone. Antibodies can be produced in an endless supply and with high reproducibility, including in the form of fully humanized antibodies synthesized by mammalian cells. Because the Fc portion to which a given scFv would be fused can be chosen freely, various versions of the antibody, with the same variable regions but differing Fc fragments (mouse, rabbit, human, etc.), can be produced, as recently described by our laboratory (18Moutel S. El Marjou A. Vielemeyer O. Nizak C. Benaroch P. Dübel S. Perez F. BMC Biotechnol. 2009; 9: 14Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). Finally, additional modifications, including fusions to fluorescent tags, can be easily made. In summary, we have described a novel in vitro approach that allows the selection of high quality phosphospecific antibodies directly from full-length phosphorylated antigens, thus obviating the need for up-front phospho-residue mapping. To meet the challenges of understanding the proteome in all its complexity, collections of such modification-specific sensors will have to be assembled in addition to already existing antibody libraries. We strongly believe that our in vitro approach, by providing a simple and robust alternative to classical methods and at the same time offering savings in both time and resources, will be a reliable tool in this endeavor.

https://openalex.org/W1997812508,"Multiple studies suggest that phospholipase C-gamma (PLC-gamma) contributes to regulation of sodium/hydrogen exchanger 3 (NHE3) in the small intestine, although the mechanism(s) for this regulation remain unknown. We demonstrate here that PLC-gamma binds directly to the C terminus of NHE3 and exists in similar sized multiprotein complexes as NHE3. This binding is dynamic and decreases with elevated [Ca(2+)](i). The PLC-gamma-binding site in NHE3 was identified (amino acids 586-605) and shown to be a critical regulatory domain for protein complex formation, because when it is mutated, NHE3 binding to PLC-gamma as well as NHERF2 is lost. An inhibitory peptide, which binds to the Src homology 2 domains contained in PLC-gamma without interrupting binding of PLC-gamma to NHE3, was used to probe a non-lipase-dependent role of PLC-gamma. In the presence of this peptide, carbachol-stimulated calcium inhibition of NHE3 was lost. These results mirror previous studies with the transient receptor potential channel and suggest that PLC-gamma may play a common role in regulating the cell-surface expression of ion transporters."

Serine proteases of the trypsin family are responsible for digestion, blood coagulation, fibrinolysis, development, fertilization, apoptosis, and immunity (1Page M.J. Di Cera E. Cell. Mol. Life Sci. 2008; 65: 1220-1236Crossref PubMed Scopus (275) Google Scholar). Activation of the protease requires the transition from a zymogen form (2Bode W. Huber R. FEBS Lett. 1976; 68: 231-236Crossref PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar) and formation of an ion pair between the newly formed amino terminus of the catalytic chain and the side chain of the highly conserved residue Asp194 (chymotrypsinogen numbering) next to the catalytic Ser195. This ensures substrate access to the active site and proper formation of the oxyanion hole contributed by the backbone N atoms of Ser195 and Gly193 (3Hedstrom L. Chem. Rev. 2002; 102: 4501-4524Crossref PubMed Scopus (1284) Google Scholar). The zymogen → protease conversion is classically associated with the onset of catalytic activity (3Hedstrom L. Chem.

Aspects Med. 2008; 29: 203-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (234) Google Scholar), have drawn attention to a significant plasticity of the trypsin fold that impacts the function of the enzyme in a decisive manner. The active form of the protease, E, coexists with an inactive form, E*, that is distinct from the zymogen conformation (9Di Cera E. IUBMB Life. 2009; 61: 510-515Crossref PubMed Scopus (247) Google Scholar). The E* form features a collapse of the 215–217 β-strand into the active site and a flip of the peptide bond between residues Glu192 and Gly193 that disrupts the oxyanion hole. Importantly, the ion pair between Ile16 and Asp194 remains intact, suggesting that E* is not equivalent to the zymogen form of the protease and that the E*-E equilibrium is established after the conversion from the zymogen form has taken place. Indeed, existing structures of the zymogen forms of trypsin (10Fehlhammer H. Bode W. Huber R. J. Mol. Biol. 1977; 111: 415-438Crossref PubMed Scopus (218) Google Scholar), chymotrypsin (11Wang D.

The most likely explanation for the widespread occurrence of inactive conformations of trypsin-like proteases is that the E*-E equilibrium is a basic property of the trypsin fold that fine tunes activity and specificity once the zymogen → protease conversion has taken place (9Di Cera E. IUBMB Life. 2009; 61: 510-515Crossref PubMed Scopus (247) Google Scholar). The new paradigm established by the E*-E equilibrium has obvious physiological relevance. In the case of complement factors, kallikreins, tryptase, and some coagulation factors must be kept to a minimum until binding of a trigger factor ensues. Stabilization of E* may afford a resting state of the protease waiting for action, as seen for other systems (24Eisenmesser E.Z. Bosco D.A. Akke M. Kern D.

For example, factor B is mostly inactive until binding of complement factor C3 unleashes catalytic activity at the site where amplification of C3 activation is most needed prior to formation of the membrane attack complex (29Gros P. Milder F.J. Janssen B.J. Nat. Rev. Immunol. 2008; 8: 48-58Crossref PubMed Scopus (224) Google Scholar). Indeed, the crystal structure of factor B reveals a conformation with the oxyanion hole disrupted by a flip of the 192–193 peptide bond (22Ponnuraj K. Xu Y. Macon K. Moore D. Volanakis J.E. Narayana S.V. Mol. Cell. 2004; 14: 17-28Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar), as observed in the E* form of thrombin (6Gandhi P.S. Chen Z. Mathews F.S. Di Cera E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2008; 105: 1832-1837Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar, 7Pineda A.O. Chen Z.W. Bah A. Garvey L.C. Mathews F.S. Di Cera E. J. Biol.

The allosteric equilibrium as shown in Scheme 1, involves the rates for the E* → E transition, k1, and backward, k−1, that define the equilibrium constant r = k−1/k1 = [E*]/[E] (5Bah A. Garvey L.C. Ge J. Di Cera E. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 40049-40056Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). The value of kcat/Km for an enzyme undergoing the E*-E equilibrium is as shown in Equation 1 (30Carrell C.J. Bush L.A. Mathews F.S. Di Cera E. Biophys. Chem. 2006; 121: 177-184Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar),View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) where sE is the value of s for the E form, and obviously sE* = 0. Likewise, the binding of an inhibitor to the enzyme undergoing the E*-E equilibrium is shown in Equation 2,View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) where KE is the value of the equilibrium association constant K for the E form, and KE* = 0. As the value of r increases upon stabilization of E*, the values of s and K in Equations 1 and 2 decrease without limits. Hence, stabilization of E* has the potential to completely abrogate substrate hydrolysis (s → 0) or inhibitor binding (K → 0). However, binding of a suitable cofactor could restore activity by triggering the E* → E transition. This suggests a simple explanation for the anticoagulant profile observed in a number of thrombin mutants that have poor activity toward all physiological substrates but retain activity toward the anticoagulant protein C in the presence of the cofactor thrombomodulin (31Cantwell A.M.

Northampton, MA) with the sample cell containing thrombin and the syringe injecting argatroban. The sample volume for iTC200 is 204.6 μl and the total volume of injected ligand is 39.7 μl. The thermal equilibration step at 37 °C, was followed by an initial 60-s delay step and subsequently an initial 0.2-μl injection. Typically, 19 serial injections of 2 μl and 1 last injection of 1.5 μl of ligand were performed at an interval of 180 s. The stirring speed was maintained at 1000 rpm, and the reference power was kept constant at 5 μcal/s. The heat associated with each injection of ligand was integrated and plotted against the molar ratio of ligand to macromolecule. Thermodynamic parameters were extracted from a curve fit to the data using the software (Origin 7.0) provided by MicroCal according to a one-site binding model. Experiments were performed in triplicate with excellent reproducibility (<10% variation in thermodynamic parameters). Crystals of human thrombin Δ146–149e were obtained using the hanging drop vapor-diffusion method. A solution of Δ146–149e (8 mg/ml in 1 μl) in 50 mm NaCl, 20 mm Tris, pH 7.5, was mixed with an equal volume reservoir solution containing 20% PEG20000 and 100 mm Tris, pH 8.5, at 25 °C. Crystals were tetragonal, space group P43, with unit cell parameters a = b = 58.2 Å, c = 119.6 Å, and contained one molecule in the asymmetric unit. Crystals were flash-frozen in liquid nitrogen after soaking in artificial mother liquor containing 15% (v/v) glycerol. X-ray diffraction data were recorded on an ADSC Quantum 315 CCD at beamline 14-BM-C at BIOCARS (Argonne, IL). One pass of 150° with steps of 0.5° was collected and processed to 1.55 Å resolution.

Open table in a new tab Once generated in the blood from its inactive precursor prothrombin, thrombin acts as a procoagulant when it converts fibrinogen into an insoluble fibrin clot (45Spraggon G. Everse S.J. Doolittle R.F. Nature. 1997; 389: 455-462Crossref PubMed Scopus (390) Google Scholar) and acts as a prothrombotic when it cleaves protease-activated receptors (PARs) (46Coughlin S.R. Nature. 2000; 407: 258-264Crossref PubMed Scopus (2081) Google Scholar, 47Coughlin S.R. J. Thromb. Haemost. 2005; 3: 1800-1814Crossref PubMed Scopus (803) Google Scholar). However, upon interaction with the endothelial cell receptor thrombomodulin, thrombin loses both procoagulant and prothrombotic functions and increases its activity >1,000-fold toward the anticoagulant protein C (48Esmon C.T. Chest. 2003; 124: 26S-32SAbstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (654) Google Scholar). A thrombin mutant stabilized in the E* form would have little or no activity toward physiological substrates. If this mutant could be converted to the E form upon binding of thrombomodulin, then a selective anticoagulant response would be elicited upon activation of protein C in the vascular endothelium where thrombomodulin is present. The mutant Δ146–149e carries a deletion of the nine residues 146ETWTANVGK149e in the autolysis loop and was originally constructed to assess the role of this highly flexible domain in thrombin function (49Dang Q.D. Sabetta M. Di Cera E. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 19649-19651Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). The sequence 149aANVGK149e is not present in trypsin and chymotrypsin and can be deleted without functional consequences (49Dang Q.D. Sabetta M. Di Cera E. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 19649-19651Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). Also, swapping the entire 146ETWTANVGK149e sequence of thrombin with the 146SSGT149 sequence of trypsin (50DiBella E.E. Scheraga H.A. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 4427-4433Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar) or deleting the 146ETW148 sequence (51Le Bonniec B.F. Guinto E.R. Esmon C.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 19341-19348Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) produces perturbations of function that are recapitulated by the single mutations E146A and R221aA (32Dang Q.D.

The entire autolysis loop likely participates in the long range communication seen in the E*-E equilibrium (6Gandhi P.S. Chen Z. Mathews F.S. Di Cera E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2008; 105: 1832-1837Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar) between the 220-loop, the active site, and exosite I where thrombomodulin binds (8Di Cera E. Mol. Aspects Med. 2008; 29: 203-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (234) Google Scholar). Deletion of the entire sequence 146ETWTANVGK149e in the Δ146–149e mutant causes a significant loss of activity toward chromogenic and physiological substrates, but binding of thrombomodulin almost completely restores activity toward the anticoagulant protein C (Fig. 1). Importantly, thrombomodulin has only a modest effect on the hydrolysis of a chromogenic substrate (Fig. 1), as already documented for other anticoagulant thrombin mutants (52Pineda A.O. Chen Z.W. Caccia S. Cantwell A.M. Savvides S.N. Waksman G. Mathews F.S. Di Cera E. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 39824-39828Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar) and wild type (53Vindigni A. White C.E. Komives E.A. Di Cera E. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 6674-6681Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). These properties suggest that the Δ146–149e mutation shifts the E*-E equilibrium of thrombin in favor of E*, and thrombomodulin in complex with protein C can switch the mutant back into the active conformation E. Evidence that the thrombin mutant Δ146–149e is stabilized in the E* form in solution comes from inspection of the values of kcat/Km for chromogenic and natural substrates. The data in Fig. 1 reveal a remarkable similarity in the loss of activity toward fibrinogen, PAR1, PAR3, and protein C for the Δ146–149e mutant compared with wild type. Likewise, a comparable loss of activity is observed toward several chromogenic substrates bearing replacements at the P1 or P2 positions (54Vindigni A. Dang Q.D. Di Cera E. Nat. Biotechnol. 1997; 15: 891-895Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). On the average, the loss is about 200-fold. For a mutation that selectively shifts the E*-E equilibrium in favor of E*, without introducing additional effects on substrate or inhibitor recognition, the values of s and K in Equations 1–2 must decrease by the same amount. Specifically, the ratio shown in Equation 3 between the wild-type (WT) and mutant values of s and K must be the same for all substrates and inhibitors. The data in Fig. 1 are consistent with the prediction from Equation 3. Perturbation of PAR4 recognition is significantly more pronounced compared with all other substrates, but this is consistent with the direct interactions that this substrate makes with residues of the autolysis loop (55Bah A. Chen Z. Bush-Pelc L.A. Mathews F.S. Di Cera E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2007; 104: 11603-11608Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). Further support for stabilization of E* in the Δ146–149e mutant comes from calorimetric measurements of the binding of the inhibitor argatroban (39Tanaka K.A. Gruber A. Szlam F. Bush L.A. Hanson S.R. Di Cera E. Blood Coagul. Fibrinolysis. 2008; 19: 465-468Crossref PubMed Scopus (3) Google Scholar) to the active site. The value of K (see Equation 2) drops 135-fold in the mutant compared with wild type (Fig. 2), as expected from Equation 3.FIGURE 2Argatroban binding to thrombin wild type (left) and Δ146–149e (right) measured by isothermal titration calorimetry. The top panel shows the heat exchanged in each individual titration for the thrombin sample (bottom trace) and the argatroban buffer control (top trace). The bottom panel is the integration of the data to yield the overall heat exchanged as a function of the ligand/protein molar ratio. Experimental conditions are 5 mm Tris, 0.1% polyethylene glycol, 145 mm NaCl, pH 7.4, 37 °C. The enzyme and argatroban concentrations are as follows: 13.44 and 140 μm (thrombin wild type); 52.5 and 777 μm (Δ146–149e). Titration curves were fit using the Origin software of the iTC200, with best fit parameter values as follows: thrombin wild type, K = 1.0 ± 0.1 108m−1, ΔG = −11.3 ± 0.1 kcal/mol, ΔH = −15.2 ± 0.1 kcal/mol, and TΔS = −3.9 ± 0.1 kcal/mol; Δ146–149e, K = 7.4 ± 0.4 105m−1, ΔG = −8.3 ± 0.1 kcal/mol, ΔH = −13.8 ± 0.1 kcal/mol, and TΔS = −5.5 ± 0.1 kcal/mol.

Chen Z. Mathews F.S. Di Cera E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2008; 105: 1832-1837Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). Therefore, the thrombin mutant Δ146–149e likely functions as an allosteric switch stabilized into the inactive form E* until the combined binding of thrombomodulin and protein C shifts E* to E and restores activity. To gain direct information on the conformational properties of the Δ146–149e mutant, its crystal structure was solved in the free form at 1.55 Å resolution. Consistent with the functional data, the mutant assumes a collapsed conformation that is practically identical (r.m.s.d. 0.154 Å) to the E* form identified recently from the structure of the thrombin mutant D102N (6Gandhi P.S.

https://openalex.org/W2076287486,"The Sulfolobus solfataricus protein acetyltransferase (PAT) acetylates ALBA, an abundant nonspecific DNA-binding protein, on Lys(16) to reduce its DNA affinity, and the Sir2 deacetylase reverses the modification to cause transcriptional repression. This represents a ""primitive"" model for chromatin regulation analogous to histone modification in eukaryotes. We report the 1.84-A crystal structure of PAT in complex with coenzyme A. The structure reveals homology to both prokaryotic GNAT acetyltransferases and eukaryotic histone acetyltransferases (HATs), with an additional ""bent helix"" proximal to the substrate binding site that might play an autoregulatory function. Investigation of active site mutants suggests that PAT does not use a single general base or acid residue for substrate deprotonation and product reprotonation, respectively, and that a diffusional step, such as substrate binding, may be rate-limiting. The catalytic efficiency of PAT toward ALBA is low relative to other acetyltransferases, suggesting that there may be better, unidentified substrates for PAT. The structural similarity of PAT to eukaryotic HATs combined with its conserved role in chromatin regulation suggests that PAT is evolutionarily related to the eukaryotic HATs."

Genes pertaining to male reproduction, especially those involved in sperm production, evolve morphologically and functionally much faster than their nonsexual counterparts. A comparison of SLO3 channel amino acid sequences from several species revealed a high degree of structural divergence relative to their SLO1 channel paralogues. To reveal any biophysical differences accompanying this rapid structural divergence, we analyzed the functional properties of SLO3 channels from two species, bovine and mouse. We observed several functional differences including voltage range of activation, kinetics, and pH sensitivity. Although SLO3 channel proteins from these two species lack conservation in many structural regions, we found that the first two of these three functional differences map to the same loop structure in their RCK1 (regulator of K+ conductance 1) domain, which links the intermediate RCK1 subdomain to the C-terminal subdomain. We found that small structural changes in this region produce major changes in the voltage range of activation and kinetics. This rapidly evolving loop peptide shows the greatest length and sequence polymorphisms within RCK1 domains from many different species.

SLO3 encodes a high conductance potassium (K+) channel of the SLO potassium channel family (4Schreiber M. Wei A. Yuan A. Gaut J. Saito M. Salkoff L. J. Biol.

SLO3 channels were first cloned in 1998, from a testis cDNA library based on their homology to the BK (SLO1 channel). Several lines of evidence suggest that SLO3 expression is limited to mammalian testes. Reverse transcription-PCR experiments in mouse using total RNA from many tissues showed expression only in testes, and Northern analysis using RNA derived from many tissues in both mouse and human showed expression only in testes of both species. In contrast, the closely related paralogue SLO1 is widely expressed in many tissues (5Butler A. Tsunoda S. McCobb D.P. Wei A. Salkoff L.

Expression of SLO3 channels in Xenopus oocytes showed that, like SLO1 channels, they express high conductance K+ channels, and their gating also includes a component of voltage sensitivity. However, they differ in several ways. Of greatest significance is their ion dependence of gating. SLO1 channels are sensitive to changes in intracellular Ca2+ at physiological concentrations, whereas SLO3 channels are not. On the other hand, SLO3 channels are highly sensitive to intracellular pH and are activated by both voltage and intracellular alkalinization (4Schreiber M. Wei A. Yuan A. Gaut J. Saito M. Salkoff L. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 3509-3516Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (181) Google Scholar). Because of its sensitivity to both pH and voltage, SLO3 could be involved in sperm capacitation and/or the acrosome reaction, which are essential steps in fertilization where changes in both intracellular pH and membrane potential are known to occur (reviewed in Refs. 9Visconti P.E.

In comparing the primary structures of SLO3 channel subunits among several mammalian species, we were struck by their low sequence conservation relative to SLO1 channel subunits. It has been shown that genes that mediate sexual reproduction are more divergent than genes expressed in nonreproductive tissues (1Wyckoff G.J. Wang W. Wu C.I.

Recently another gene encoding an ion channel whose expression is limited to male testes has also been shown to have unusually low sequence conservation among mammals. This gene, Catsper, is also apparently involved in the physiology of fertilization (13Podlaha O. Webb D.M. Tucker P.K. Zhang J. Mol. Biol.

Here we report the cloning and functional expression of the SLO3 gene from the bovine species (bSLO3) 2The abbreviations used are: bbovinemmouseDIDS4,4′-diisothiocyanostilbene-2,2′-disulfonic acidWTwild typepSpicosiemens. 2The abbreviations used are: bbovinemmouseDIDS4,4′-diisothiocyanostilbene-2,2′-disulfonic acidWTwild typepSpicosiemens. and show that functional differences between it and its mouse orthologue (mSLO3) map to a region in RCK1 with particularly low conservation. bovine mouse 4,4′-diisothiocyanostilbene-2,2′-disulfonic acid wild type picosiemens. bovine mouse 4,4′-diisothiocyanostilbene-2,2′-disulfonic acid wild type picosiemens. bSLO3 was cloned by reverse transcription-PCR of bovine testes total RNA (obtained from Biochain). First strand cDNA was made using Powerscript reverse transcriptase (Clontech) and random hexamers. Specific primers were made to the predicted bovine sequence and used to amplify bSLO3 in convenient-sized pieces from the first strand cDNA with a Clontech Advantage-HF 2 PCR kit as well as with New England Biolabs Phusion high fidelity DNA polymerase. The pieces were ligated into our pOX oocyte expression vector to make a complete construct. The mSLO3 construct used is described (4Schreiber M. Wei A. Yuan A. Gaut J. Saito M. Salkoff L. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 3509-3516Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (181) Google Scholar). The above-described bSLO3 construct and the mSLO3 construct described by Schreiber (4Schreiber M.

Chimeric pieces were made either by PCR amplification or by a two-step overlap extension/PCR amplification (New England Biolabs Phusion polymerase) and then subcloned into convenient restriction sites in either the bSLO3 or the mSLO3 construct. The final chimeric amino acid sequences of the constructs, expressed as residue numbers from the protein sequences shown in Fig. 1, are as follows: 1) for Chim1: bSLO3, Met1–Asn168; mSLO3, Ser172–Lys455; and bSLO3, Ala453–His1141; 2) for Chim2: bSLO3, Met1–Asn168; mSLO3, Ser172–Lys862; and bSLO3, Arg848–Hsi1141; 3) for Chim3: mSLO3, Met1–Lys455; bSLO3, Ala453–Val631; and mSLO3, Met636–Lys1121; 4) for mSLO3-A: mSLO3, Met1–Lys455; bSLO3, Ala453–Ile470; and mSLO3, Cys474; 5) for mSLO3-B: mSLO3, Met1–Thr497; bSLO3, Ser495–Cys515; and mSLO3, Asn519–Lys1121; and 6) for mSLO3-C: mSLO3, Met1–Asp533; bSLO3, Phe531–His548; and mSLO3, Lys552–Lys1121. To create mSLO3-Ba and mSLO3-Bb, mSLO3 residues were replaced by the corresponding residues present in bSLO3 (see Fig. 5C) using the methods described above.FIGURE 5A small region in the distal part of the RCK1 domain has the most dramatic effect in changing the voltage range of activation of mSLO3 channels. A, G-V curve obtained from expression of chimera 3 compared with wild type G-V curves shows a G-V relation substantially shifted to negative values. Chimera 3 is a mSLO3-based construct containing only the distal half of RCK1 from bSLO3. Boltzmann fit of the chimera 3 G-V curve gave V½ and k values of +8.9 ± 1.98 mV and 23.97 ± 1.3 (n = 11), respectively. B, the small bSLO3 sequence in chimera 3 was subdivided and incorporated into three constructs, mSLO-A, mSLO3-B, and mSLO3-C. G-V relationships are shown for mSLO-A, mSLO3-B, and mSLO3-C chimeras. Their respective V½ parameters are 47 ± 3.15, 16.2 ± 1.42, and 56.1 ± 2.3 mV, and their respective k parameters are 23.5 ± 1.73, 26.5 ± 0.98, and 23.6 ± 0.91 (n = 12, 19, and 11) (means ± S.E.). The mSLO3-B G-V curve substantially resembled that of wild type bSLO3 with regard to its voltage parameters. C, subregion B was further subdivided. Using the mSLO3 wild type template, we incorporated four of the upstream residues of bovine subregion B to create mSLO3-Ba and three of the downstream bovine subregion B residues to create mSLO3-Bb. The respective V½ values of activation of these constructs are 42.4 ± 4.7 and 28.8 ± 1.5 mV, and the respective k values are 34.1 ± 2.5 and 30.2 ± 1.2 for mSLO3-Ba (n = 7) and mSLO3-Bb (n = 8). The sequence at the bottom shows the sequence of mSLO3 where two histidine residues have been replaced by the corresponding residues present in bSLO3. As shown in Fig. 6, the replacement of the histidine residues had no effect on the pH sensitivity of mSLO3 channels.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Core and tail constructs were made by PCR amplification (New England Biolabs Phusion polymerase) of the areas of interest and subcloned into pOX. The amino acid sequences of the constructs, expressed as residue numbers from the protein sequences shown in Fig. 1, are as follows: bSLO3 core, bSLO3 Met1–Arg633; bSLO3 tail, bSLO3 Met632–His1141; mSlo3 core, mSLO3 Met1–Met636; and mSLO3 tail, and mSLO3 Met636–Lys1121. Defolliculated oocytes were injected with 75 ng of cRNA from SLO3 using a Drummond Scientific nanoinjector (Broomall, PA). Injected oocytes were incubated at 18 °C in ND96 medium (96 mm NaCl, 2 mm KCl, 1.8 mm CaCl2, 1 mm MgCl2, 5 mm HEPES, pH 7.5, with NaOH). The oocytes were electrophysiologically analyzed 3–5 days after injection. Two-microelectrode voltage clamp recordings were obtained in ND96 plus 1 mm DIDS to block the endogenous chloride conductances. For patch-clamp experiments, the vitelline membranes were mechanically removed before recording. Inside-out patches were analyzed while perfusing the intracellular side of the membrane with a solution containing 140 mm potassium methanesulfonate, 30 mm KOH, 10 mm HEPES. pH was adjusted to 9 (with KOH) or to 5 with methanesulfonic acid. The pipette solution was 140 mm potassium methanesulfonate, 20 mm KOH, 10 mm HEPES, 2 mm MgCl2, 5 mm EGTA, pH 7. Pipette tip resistance ranged from 2 to 3 megaohms. The traces were acquired using an Axopatch 200A (Molecular Devices, Palo Alto, CA), digitized at 10 kHz, and filtered at 2 kHz. The data were analyzed using pClamp 9 (Molecular Devices), SigmaPlot 8 (Jandel Scientific, Corte Madera, CA), or Origin 6.0 (Microcal Software, Northampton, MA). Drugs and pharmacological agents used in this study were purchased from Sigma. The conductance-voltage (G-V) relationships of the wild type and mutant channels were obtained by converting the current values at steady state to conductances using the equation G = I/(Vm − Erev), where I is the K+ current at steady state, Vm is the test pulse potential, and Erev is the estimated reversal potential. The G-V curves were fitted with the Boltzmann equation, G = Gmin + [(Gmax − Gmin)/(1 + e(−(V − V½)/k))], where V½ is the voltage for the channel at half-activation, k = RT/zF, z is the number of equivalent gating charges, and F, R, and T have their usual meanings. Fig. 1 and supplemental Fig. S1 show the primary structure of both SLO3 and SLO1 α subunits and show a comparative alignment in two species, bovine and mouse. The comparative alignments show that the SLO3 orthologues are far less conserved between these two species than are the SLO1 orthologues. SLO3 orthologues are only 62.1% identical in their amino acid sequence, whereas SLO1 orthologues are 99.4% identical. supplemental Table S1 shows that the relative low conservation of SLO3 channels is consistent among six species examined: bovine, mouse, human, canine, pig, and opossum. Within these species SLO3 pairwise identities range from 51.9 to 73.7%, whereas SLO1 identities range from 89.9 to 99.8%. This conspicuous difference in conservation is especially notable when considering that both SLO3 and SLO1 channel subunits are highly homologous, co-linear, and similar in size. Both are also similarly unique with respect to all other voltage-gated K+ channels in having an extracellular N terminus, which requires an extra membrane-spanning segment (labeled S0 in Fig. 1 and supplemental Fig. S1). These unique similarities suggest that SLO3 and SLO1 form a distinctive subfamily of potassium channels. (Note that the SLO2 paralogue lacks the S0 membrane-spanning domain and is somewhat more distant.) A comparison of Fig. 1 and supplemental Fig. S1 shows that the functional regions (defined as the membrane-spanning domains S0 through S6) and the RCK1 and RCK2 regions have much less interspecies conservation in SLO3 than in SLO1; rapid evolutionary divergence is clearly taking place within these regions in SLO3 channels relative to SLO1 channels. Because these regions are known to determine and control the biophysical properties of channels belonging to the SLO family, it is likely that some of these evolutionary changes reflect changes in biophysical properties between the bovine and mouse orthologues. To investigate this possibility, we undertook a comparative study of the basic biophysical properties of bovine and mouse channels, with the intention of physically mapping any functional differences to the evolutionarily diverged structural domains. Fig. 2A shows a comparison of whole cell currents carried by bSLO3 and mSLO3 channels heterologously expressed in Xenopus oocytes. In the whole cell configuration, both bSLO3 currents and mSLO3 currents resemble a voltage-dependent delayed rectifier, showing little or no inactivation. One obvious difference between the two is that bSLO3 currents have a faster rate of rise in response to depolarizing voltage clamp step pulses than mSLO3 currents. This property is further discussed below. Another major difference between bSLO3 and mSLO3 currents is their voltage range of activation; Fig. 2B shows that bSLO3 activation is significantly more negative relative to mSLO3. bSLO3 currents are obvious at −60 mV, whereas mSLO3 current activation is not obvious until approximately +20 mV. The V½ of activation for bSLO3 currents is approximately +0.5 mV, which is considerably more negative than the half-activation voltage we estimate for mSLO3 of approximately +77 mV. (Schreiber et al. (4Schreiber M. Wei A. Yuan A. Gaut J. Saito M. Salkoff L. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 3509-3516Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (181) Google Scholar) estimated a V½ of +70 mV.) bSLO3 channels have unusually weak voltage dependence. Fitting the bSLO3 current-voltage relation with a Boltzmann function shows a slope factor of 31.7 mV for an e-fold change in conductance indicating a minimum equivalent gating charge of ∼0.8 e. This contrasts with the somewhat greater apparent voltage sensitivity of mSLO3, which we estimate has a minimum equivalent gating charge of ∼1.2 e. Such weak voltage sensitivity and left-shifted current-voltage relation for bSLO3 predict that a significant number of channels will be open throughout the physiologically relevant voltage range in sperm, including the resting potential. Because spermatozoa have a very high input resistance, the opening of only a few high conductance K+ channels such as SLO3 could have a profound impact on the resting potential and excitable properties of the cell. The third difference noted between these two channels is their difference in selectivity for K+ over Na+. bSLO3 channels have a pK/pNa of ∼17 (Fig. 2C). Although this K+ selectivity over Na+ is somewhat low relative to many other types of K+ channels, it nevertheless is significantly higher than that of mSLO3 channels, which have unusually low selectivity for K+ over Na+; we measured pK/pNa to be ∼10 in the current study. (Schreiber et al. (4Schreiber M. Wei A. Yuan A. Gaut J. Saito M. Salkoff L. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 3509-3516Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (181) Google Scholar) reported a PK/PNa of ∼5 for mSLO3 channels.) The higher K+ selectivity of bSLO3 channels would allow them to contribute more to the hyperpolarization of the sperm plasma membrane. On the other hand, the reversal potential of mSLO3 channels would be more affected by the extracellular environment that sperm encounter on their journey to the egg. In high external Na+ environments, mSLO3 channels may have a depolarizing influence on the mouse sperm membrane potential. A fourth difference noted between bSLO3 and mSLO3 channels is their pH sensitivity, with bSLO3 showing somewhat less sensitivity to pH than mSLO3. Data relating to their pH sensitivity will be shown and discussed in Fig. 6. Like mSLO3 channels, bSLO3 channels are high conductance channels with very brief mean open times. Fig. 3 shows an inside-out patch containing bSLO3 with a conductance of 83 pS (84 ± 1.5 pS was the conductance measured in seven patches) in 140 mm symmetrical K+. mSLO3 channels have been reported to have a similar single channel conductance (77 pS) in symmetric 140 mm K+ (20). The mean open time values of bSLO3 channels vary from 0.18 ± 0.02 ms at −60 mV to 0.38 ± 0.07 ms at +50 mV at pHi 9 (n = 4). As predicted from the very shallow slope of its current-voltage relation, bSLO3 single channel openings are obvious throughout a wide voltage range, including negative voltages (Fig. 3). A striking difference in biophysical properties between bSLO3 and mSLO3 was the negative voltage range of bSLO3 current activation relative to mSLO3. Because there were so many differences in sequence between bSLO3 and mSLO3, we decided to narrow down the relevant region by creating interspecies (bovine and mouse) chimeric channel constructs involving large regions of the α subunits and testing each for its voltage range of activation. Our first approach in creating chimeric channels was to use a previously described technique (17Wei A. Solaro C. Lingle C. Salkoff L. Neuron. 1994; 13: 671-681Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (227) Google Scholar, 18Schreiber M. Yuan A. Salkoff L. Nat. Neurosci. 1999; 2: 416-421Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar, 19Xia X.M. Zhang X. Lingle C.J. J. Neurosci. 2004; 24: 5585-5591Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar) of creating core and tail regions from bovine and mouse α subunits and co-expressing the two constructs encoded on separate cRNAs. Note that we had previously used this technique to analyze SLO1 channels and had shown that co-injection of both core and tail cRNA into Xenopus oocytes produced SLO1 channels with functional properties indistinguishable from those of the wild type (17Wei A. Solaro C. Lingle C. Salkoff L. Neuron. 1994; 13: 671-681Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (227) Google Scholar, 18Schreiber M. Yuan A. Salkoff L. Nat. Neurosci. 1999; 2: 416-421Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar). Furthermore we showed that functional channels can even be produced when co-expressing core and tail constructs from SLO1 and SLO3 channels (18Schreiber M. Yuan A. Salkoff L. Nat. Neurosci. 1999; 2: 416-421Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar). Using this approach we could mix and match the cores and tails from different species and compare the results. Core constructs of the α subunits were created for each of the two species beginning at the N terminus including membrane-spanning domains S0 through S6 and all of RCK1 and ending in the nonconserved linker region that joins RCK1 and RCK2 (Fig. 4A). C-terminal tail constructs were synthesized that began in the nonconserved linker region and extended through RCK2 to the C-terminal end of the channel subunit. Our primary objective in doing the core and tail experiments was to determine whether structural domains in the tail region were a major determinant of the voltage range of activation. As a control we undertook the co-expression of mouse SLO3 core with mouse SLO3 tail. As expected, the currents produced in this experiment were indistinguishable from wild type mSLO3 currents (data not shown). In the next experiments we co-expressed the mouse tail with the bovine core to see whether the mouse tail region would cause a right shifted voltage range of activation when combined with the bovine core region. However, the currents in these experiments were virtually indistinguishable from wild type bovine (bSLO3) currents (Fig. 4A) in having a left-shifted voltage range of activation typical of bSLO3 and unlike mSLO3. These experiments suggested that the tail region, which contained the entire RCK2 domain, could be ruled out as the major determinant of the voltage range of activation. To explore the importance of regions located in the core domain, three chimeras where then constructed to subdivide the core region between bSLO3 and mSLO3 (chimeras 1–3). These constructs are shown diagrammatically in FIGURE 4, FIGURE 5. Experiments were then undertaken to analyze the voltage range of activation produced by each chimeric construct. Chimera 1 is a bSLO3-based chimera containing the region of mSLO3 extending from S3 to the middle of RCK1. When tested, these channels also had properties similar to wild type bSLO3 channels in that their voltage range of activation was left-shifted (Fig. 4B). This result suggested that the structural region responsible for the bSLO3 left-shifted voltage range of activation might be located outside of the S3 to mid-RCK1 region. Chimera 2 was used to assay the region to the right of the chimera 1 mSLO3-bSLO3 join point located in the middle of RCK1 because the mSLO3 insert had a common upstream origin with chimera 1 but extended through the entire RCK1 region (Fig. 4C, diagram). Chimera 2 channels, unlike chimera 1, expressed a current that had a more depolarized voltage range of activation and resulted in shifting the V½ of ∼40 mV to the right of wild type bSLO3 (see Fig. 4 legend). This represented a significant shift of the G-V curve toward the activation range of wild type mSLO3. The results of this experiment focused our attention on the distal half of RCK1 as being responsible for controlling the voltage range of activation in these SLO3 channel. This was because the influence of the RCK2 domain had been already ruled out by the results of the bSLO3 core-mSLO3 tail co-expression experiment shown in Fig. 4A, which produced currents with a G-V relation similar to wild type bSLO3 but included RCK2 in the mSLO3 tail. Thus, we narrowed down the critical region of the channel involved in determining the left-shifted voltage range of activation to the distal half of the RCK1 domain (Fig. 4, diagram, gray shading). To test whether this bSLO3 region alone was both necessary and sufficient to confer the left-shifted voltage range of activation, we created chimera 3, which was based on mSLO3 but contained the distal half of RCK1 from bSLO3 (diagram at top of Fig. 5). If our assumptions were correct, chimera 3, which contained mostly mSLO3 sequence except for the distal half of RCK1, should have a left-shifted G-V relation characteristic of wild type bSLO3. Fig. 5A shows the results of chimera 3 expression. Currents expressed by chimera 3 were indeed shifted almost entirely into the wild type bSLO3 voltage range, having a V½ of activation of +8.84 ± 1.98 mV (n = 11) to +0.49 ± 2.1 mV (n = 21) seen for bSLO3. We next attempted to subdivide the distal half of the RCK1 region of bSLO3 to narrow down the region containing critical amino acid differences between bSLO3 and mSLO3 in this region, which might account for the shift in voltage range of activation. A comparison of amino acid sequence conservation in this region showed several areas of low conservation (Fig. 1). Three of these subregions (red bars A–C in Fig. 1) were chosen for analysis by creating three separate subunit constructs, mSLO3-A, mSLO3-B, and mSLO3-C by site-directed mutagenesis. Each of these three subunit constructs was identical to wild type mSLO3 except for the incorporation of bSLO3 residue substitutions from subregion A, B, or C. The results of functional expression of mSLO3-A, mSLO3-B, and mSLO3-C are shown in Fig. 5B. Of these three subregions of RCK1, subregion B clearly had the greatest effect in left shifting the voltage range of channel activation; chimera mSLO3-B had a V½ of 16.2 ± 1.42 mV (n = 19), which was closest to the V½ of 0.49 ± 2.1 mV (n = 21) of wild type bSLO3 and far left-shifted from wild type mSLO3 (V½ of 77.1. ± 4.9 (n = 9)). The incorporation of subregions A and C had much smaller effects (Fig. 5B). Finally, we subdivided subregion B further to explore whether the amino acid residues determining the voltage range of activation within this region were distributed over the region, clustered, or even limited to a single residue (Fig. 5C). Thus, using the mSLO3 template, we incorporated four of the upstream residues of bovine subregion B to create mSLO3-Ba and three of the downstream bovine subregion B residues to create mSLO3-Bb (Fig. 5C). An analysis of the voltage range of activation of each of the constructs suggested that the amino acid residues determining this property were distributed over the region. Thus, whereas the entire subregion B from bovine incorporated into mSLO3 had a V½ of 16.2 ± 1.4 mV compared with that of WT mSLO3 (V½ of 77.1 ± 4.9 mV), both mSLO3-Ba and mSLO3-Bb were intermediate, with of V½ values of 42.4 ± 4.7 mV (n = 7) and 28.8 ± 1.5 mV (n = 8), respectively. Although mSLO3-Bb had a significantly larger effect on left shifting the voltage range of activation, it appears that several amino acid residues distributed across subregion B have significant effects on the voltage range of activation. An additional functional property that differs between currents produced by bSLO3 and mSLO3 channels is their sensitivity to pH. When subjected to a rise in the intracellular pH induced by the application of NH4Cl to alkalinize the intracellular medium, currents from both channels increase in amplitude (Fig. 6) (4Schreiber M. Wei A. Yuan A. Gaut J. Saito M. Salkoff L. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 3509-3516Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (181) Google Scholar, 20Zhang X. Zeng X. Xia X.M. Lingle C.J. J. Gen. Physiol. 2006; 128: 301-315Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). However, mSLO3 currents exhibit a somewhat larger relative increase than bSLO3 currents (Fig. 6 legend). We wondered whether this difference in pH sensitivity might be due to the fact that two histidine residues are conspicuously present in subregion B of mSLO3, whereas only one histidine residue is present in subregion B of bSLO3 (Fig. 5C, green asterisks; note also that the single His residue in bSLO3 is not in register with either of the two His residues present in mSLO3). To investigate this question, we replaced both of the histidine residues present in mSLO3 with the corresponding residues present in bSLO3 (glutamate and leucine) and tested currents produced by this construct for its pH sensitivity. The results of this experiment were negative; the replacement of both histidine residues in the mSLO3 subregion B sequence had no significant effect on the pH sensitivity of the channel (Fig. 6). Thus, although we cannot say definitively what the relationship is between pH sensitivity and voltage range of activation (or activation kinetics), it seems unlikely that the two histidine residues present in the mSLO3 subregion B area are central to the pH sensor. Another notable difference between wild type bSLO3 and mSLO3 channels is their difference in activation kinetics. bSLO3 currents activate faster and at more negative potentials than mSLO3 currents (Fig. 7A, bSLO3 wt and mSLO3 wt). To quantify macroscopic activation rates, we fitted a single exponential function to the first 22 ms of the activating currents at different voltages and plotted τact versus voltage (Fig. 7B). bSLO3 currents showed faster activation than mSLO3 currents at all voltages studied. Furthermore bSLO3 currents showed less voltage sensitivity in their rates of activation, in contrast to mSLO3 currents, which activate more rapidly at more positive voltages. Remarkably, we also found that chimera mSLO3-B, which is identical in amino acid sequence to wild type mSLO3 except for the small RCK1 subregion B from bSLO3, had current activation rates highly similar to those of wild type bSLO3 (Fig. 7). Additionally, mSLO3-B shows similar voltage dependence of activation rates to bSLO3 (Fig. 7B). This was unlike the currents produced by chimera mSLO3-A or mSLO3-C, which had activation rates and kinetic properties with greater similarity to wild type mSLO3 currents (data not shown). Finally, we analyzed the kinetics of mSLO3-Ba and mSLO3-Bb, which subdivided subregion B (Fig. 5C), to explore whether the amino acid residues determining the kinetics of activation could be narrowed to yet a smaller region. An analysis of the kinetics of mSLO3-Ba and mSLO3-Bb showed that the kinetics of mSLO3-Bb channels were remarkably similar to those of wild type bSLO3, whereas mSLO3-Ba channels behaved more like wild type mSLO3. Again, this illustrated the large changes in channel behavior conferred by small structural changes in the subregion B area. A prior alignment analysis of the amino acid sequences of RCK (regulator of K+ conductance) domains produced an alignment of RCK1 domains from both eukaryotic (SLO1) and prokaryotic potassium channels (21Jiang Y. Lee A. Chen J. Cadene M. Chait B.T. MacKinnon R. Nature. 2002; 417: 515-522Crossref PubMed Scopus (1196) Google Scholar). Because the sequence of SLO3 potassium channels is co-linear and conserved with that of SLO1 potassium channels, we were able to add the SLO3 RCK1 domain to that alignment (Fig. 8). This alignment revealed that subregion B is a loop between the αG helix and the ΒG strand of the RCK1 domain and serves to link the αG helix of the intermediate subdomain to the C-terminal subdomain. Remarkably, it is this loop region that contains the greatest sequence and length polymorphisms among RCK1 domains of many species, as shown by the RCK1 sequence alignment of Jiang et al. (21Jiang Y. Lee A. Chen J. Cadene M. Chait B.T. MacKinnon R. Nature. 2002; 417: 515-522Crossref PubMed Scopus (1196) Google Scholar). This region also has unusually low sequence conservation in bovine and mouse SLO3 channels (FIGURE 1, FIGURE 2, FIGURE 3, FIGURE 4, FIGURE 5, FIGURE 6, FIGURE 7, FIGURE 8). Possible implications of this finding are discussed below. It should be mentioned that a reciprocal effect was not observed when mSLO3 subregion B was introduced into bSLO3. This reciprocal construct did not shift the voltage range of activation from the bSLO3 range to more positive values characteristic of mSLO3. It appears that, unlike mSLO3, there are several regions in bSLO3 that strongly influence its voltage range of activation. Even the large region from mSLO3 extending from S3 all the way through RCK2 and inserted into bSLO3 to form chimera 2 (Fig. 4C, diagram) only shifted the voltage range of activation a little more than halfway into the positive voltage range of mSLO3 (Fig. 4C, graph). Thus, the voltage range of activation in bSLO3 channels may involve functions or interactions of the N terminus through the S3 region, or even of the extreme C terminus, which are relatively less important in mSLO3 channels. Here we report the cloning and expression of a SLO3 orthologue from bovine species (bSLO3) and compare its sequence and functional properties with that of the previously cloned SLO3 channel from mouse (mSLO3). We found a significantly low degree of conservation in both sequence and functional properties in the SLO3 orthologues when compared with the very high degree of conservation in SLO1 orthologues in the same two species. This is despite the fact that SLO3 and SLO1 paralogues are highly homologous and co-linear. Despite their similarity, SLO3 channels seem to be driven by evolutionary pressures that radically differ from those influencing the evolution of SLO1 channels. Because SLO3 channels are only found in Mammalia, whereas SLO1 channels are found even in invertebrate phyla, it is reasonable to assume that SLO3 channels appeared relatively late in evolution, probably as a result of duplication of the SLO1 gene followed by evolutionary differentiation. The pattern of tissue distribution of these two proteins is also very different. SLO3 is only found in testis and localized in male reproductive cells (4Schreiber M. Wei A. Yuan A. Gaut J. Saito M. Salkoff L. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 3509-3516Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (181) Google Scholar), whereas SLO1 is widespread and found in many tissues including neurons and muscle. SLO1 appears to be optimized for many different roles in many different organs. Thus, its rate of change over time may be limited by its use in multiple roles. On the other hand, the role of SLO3 may be restricted to a reproductive function that requires continual optimization as species evolve and/or conditions change. In general, it is known that the spatial pattern of expression of a gene is a major determinant of its evolutionary rate of change (22Civetta A. Singh R.S. J Mol. Evol. 1995; 41: 1085-1095Crossref PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar, 23Duret L. Mouchiroud D. Mol. Biol. Evol. 2000; 17: 68-74Crossref PubMed Scopus (412) Google Scholar) because genes of different functional classes may evolve under different selective pressures. At one extreme, genes involved in sex and reproduction evolve most rapidly (2Swanson W.J. Vacquier V.D. Nat. Rev. Genet. 2002; 3: 137-144Crossref PubMed Scopus (991) Google Scholar, 24Singh R.S. Kulathinal R.J. Genes Genet. Syst. 2000; 75: 119-130Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar), and this is particularly true for those expressed in the male reproductive tract (25Coulthart M.B. Singh R.S. Mol. Biol. Evol. 1988; 5: 182-191PubMed Google Scholar). The differing functional properties of SLO3 channels from bovine and mouse species may have important consequences for the physiology of fertilization in these two species. Because of their left-shifted range of activation, bSLO3 channels are more likely to contribute to the resting potential of bovine sperm. Also, the higher K+ selectivity of bSLO3 channels would allow them to contribute more to hyperpolarization of the sperm plasma membrane, a factor that may be important in capacitation (9Visconti P.E.

U.S.A. 1999; 96: 6757-6762Crossref PubMed Scopus (185) Google Scholar). On the other hand, mSLO3 channels that activate at more positive voltages and have lower selectivity for K+ appear less suited for a role in capacitation. Recently, a pH-sensitive K+ current was detected in mouse sperm by direct voltage clamp recordings (27Navarro B. Kirichok Y. Clapham D.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2007; 104: 7688-7692Crossref PubMed Scopus (163) Google Scholar, 28Martínez-López P. Santi C.M. Treviño C.L. Ocampo-Gutiérrez A.Y. Acevedo J.J. Alisio A. Salkoff L.B. Darszon A. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2009; 381: 204-209Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar) and may be the native current carried by mSLO3 channels. Nevertheless, the physiological function of SLO3 channels remains unknown and will probably require the physiological analysis of a SLO3 gene knock-out mutant to be resolved. In MthK channels the opening and closing of the gating ring result from the movement of individual RCK subunits around two hinge points of the flexible interface. One is at Ser230 between the N-terminal lobe and the intermediate subdomain. The other one is at Thr261 within the loop between the intermediate subdomain and the C-terminal subdomain (29Ye S. Li Y. Chen L. Jiang Y. Cell. 2006; 126: 1161-1173Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). Amazingly, an alignment of the amino acid sequence of the SLO3 RCK1 domain with that of MthK shows that subregion B corresponds to the same loop between the intermediate subdomain and the C-terminal subdomain (Fig. 8). Indeed, the alignment suggests that the distal end of subregion B may well contain a hinge point analogous to MthK Thr261 (Fig. 8, red circled residue). This loop region appears to be a major determinant of channel function in that we found that very small structural changes produce large changes in channel activation and kinetics. It remains to be determined why channel function is so sensitive to amino acid residue composition in this loop area and what the critical factors are relative to, length, charge, bulk, or other physical properties. Given this sensitivity to composition, it is tempting to speculate that the high degree of sequence divergence seen in this RCK1 region in several potassium channel types and species (Fig. 8) represents an evolutionary adaptation of channel properties for a multitude of purposes.

https://openalex.org/W2047672501,"The transcription factor encoded by the murine ecotropic integration site 1 gene (MEIS1) is a partner of HOX and PBX proteins. It has been implicated in embryonic patterning and leukemia, and causally linked to restless legs syndrome. The MEIS1A C terminus harbors a transcriptional activation domain that is stimulated by protein kinase A (PKA) in a manner dependent on the co-activator of cAMP response element-binding protein (CREB), CREB-binding protein (CBP). We explored the involvement of another mediator of PKA-inducible transcription, namely the CREB co-activators transducers of regulated CREB activity (TORCs). Overexpression of TORC1 or TORC2 bypassed PKA for activation by MEIS1A. Co-immunoprecipitation experiments demonstrated a physical interaction between MEIS1 and TORC2 that is dependent on the MEIS1A C terminus, whereas chromatin immunoprecipitation revealed PKA-inducible recruitment of MEIS1, PBX1, and TORC2 on the MEIS1 target genes Hoxb2 and Meis1. The MEIS1 interaction domain on TORC1 was mapped to the N-terminal coiled-coil region, and TORC1 mutants lacking this domain attenuated the response to PKA on a natural MEIS1A target enhancer. Thus, TORCs physically cooperate with MEIS1 to achieve PKA-inducible transactivation through the MEIS1A C terminus, suggesting a concerted action in developmental and oncogenic processes."

V-ATPases are multisubunit complexes that consist of two domains, V1 (peripheral) and V0 (membrane-bound) (1.Forgac M. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2007; 8: 917-929Crossref PubMed Scopus (1065) Google Scholar, 2.Kane P.M. Microbiol. Mol. Biol. Rev. 2006; 70: 177-191Crossref PubMed Scopus (325) Google Scholar). Each of the subunits in the V-ATPase complex is critical for function and V1V0 assembly (8.Doherty R.D. Kane P.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 16845-16851Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Deletion of a peripheral V1 subunit leads to disruption of the entire V1 domain in yeast. Loss of a V0 subunit does not affect V1 assembly but disrupts the entire V0 domain, which also prevents V1 from associating with the membrane. An exception is subunit a for which two functional isoforms (Vph1, Stv1) exist in yeast (9.Manolson M.F. Wu B. Proteau D. Taillon B.E. Roberts B.T. Hoyt M.A. Jones E.W. J. Biol.

Eight different subunits (A-H) compose the V1 domain where ATP hydrolysis takes place at a catalytic hexamer A3B3 (1.Forgac M. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2007; 8: 917-929Crossref PubMed Scopus (1065) Google Scholar). Six subunits (a, c, c′, c′′, d, e) form V0, the membrane intrinsic domain that holds V1 and forms the path for proton transport via a hydrophobic ring structure (c-ring). V1 and V0 subunits contribute to the formation of one central and three peripheral stalks that connect the c-ring and the catalytic hexamer A3B3 (1.Forgac M. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2007; 8: 917-929Crossref PubMed Scopus (1065) Google Scholar). ATP hydrolysis drives rotation of the central stalk (connected to the c-ring) (10.Yokoyama K. Nakano M. Imamura H. Yoshida M.

Protons are transferred from the cytosol to each subunit of the c-ring and from the c-ring to the other side of the membrane passing through subunit a (11.Kawasaki-Nishi S. Nishi T. Forgac M. Proc.

It is postulated that the asymmetry imposed by having a 3-fold symmetry in F1 (and V1) and an apparent 10-fold symmetry in the c-ring of F0 (and V0) requires energy to be transiently stored. The energy of coupling is thought to be stored in the peripheral (stator) and central (rotor) stalk structures of F1F0 (15.Junge W. Pänke O. Cherepanov D.A. Gumbiowski K. Müller M. Engelbrecht S.

It is key for maintaining structural stability when relative rotation of subunits occurs during catalysis. Thus, the tether of subunit a in V0 could be functionally comparable with the tether of subunit b in F0 (Escherichia coli), although subunits a (V0) and b (F0) do not share sequence homology. Subunit a is a 95-kDa protein that consists of two domains that are structurally and functionally distinguishable. The hydrophilic N-terminal domain (∼45 kDa) is oriented toward the cytosolic side of the membrane and contains the information necessary to deliver V-ATPases to different compartments (19.Kawasaki-Nishi S.

It is through these interactions that the N-terminal domain serves as a stator, which prevents rotation of the A3B3 hexamer during catalysis. The other half of subunit a, the C-terminal domain (∼50 kDa), is buried in the membrane by multiple transmembrane-spanning regions (9.Manolson M.F. Wu B. Proteau D. Taillon B.E. Roberts B.T.

In contrast to its role as stator during catalysis, the N-terminal domain of subunit a is a movable element that switches positions when V1V0 is regulated by disassembly and reassembly in vivo (1.Forgac M.

In the absence of glucose the V-ATPase complex dissociates into three parts: V1 subunit C, V1 (without subunit C), and V0 (23.Kane P.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 17025-17032Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Disassembly is reversible, and the three components reassociate immediately after glucose addition, restoring ATP hydrolysis and proton transport. As V1V0 disassembles and reassembles, the N-terminal domain of subunit a alternates between V1V0 and V0 (26.Wilkens S. Inoue T. Forgac M. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 41942-41949Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar, 27.Wilkens S. Forgac M. J. Biol.

As its functional and regulatory roles emerge, it becomes clear that the cytosolic N terminus of V0 subunit a is key for V1V0 activity, assembly, and regulation. In this study deletions were made at amino acids that connect the N-terminal and C-terminal domains of subunit a Vph1. Shrinking of the tether that anchors subunit a to the membrane harmed assembly of subunit d into V0, making yeast cells sensitive to pH (vma growth phenotype). Growth defects were rescued by exogenous VMA6, the gene encoding subunit d. Remarkably, subunit d restored assembly and significant function of V-ATPase proton pumps that had up to 46 residues of the tether removed. Because V1V0 containing tether-less vph1 assembled with peripheral V1 subunits and with the glycolytic enzyme phosphofructokinase, we concluded that no major structural changes were generated at the N- and C-terminal domains. Early steps of V0 assembly, and trafficking were likely impaired by shorter tethers and rescued by VMA6. The potential mechanisms by which overexpression of subunit d rescued subunit a deletions are discussed. Zymolase 100T was purchased from Seikagaku.

Cells were washed in 10 mm Tris·HCl, pH 7.5, containing 1.2 m sorbitol and converted to spheroplasts by treatment with zymolase (4 units/ml) at 30 °C for 20 min. Spheroplasts were gently washed twice in 10 mm Tris·HCl, pH 7.5, 2% glucose, and 1.2 m sorbitol. Washed spheroplasts were incubated in YEPD plus 1.2 m sorbitol for 15 min, harvested, and lysed by the addition of ice-chilled PBS containing protease inhibitors and 1% C12E9 in the presence of 1 mm dithiobis[succinimidyl propionate]. Lysis was completed by Dounce homogenization on ice, and the cross-linker was quenched with 1 mm Tris·HCl, pH 7.5. The lysate was cleared by adding 100 μl of protein A-Sepharose (40% suspension in PBS plus 5 mg/ml bovine serum albumin). After 15 min of incubation, lysates were centrifuged at 3750 rpm for 10 min at 4 °C in a bench-top Beckman GPR centrifuge. The resulting supernatant was incubated with the indicated antibody overnight at 4 °C in the presence of PBS containing 5 mg/ml bovine serum albumin and protease inhibitors. The monoclonal antibodies 8B1 (anti-subunit A) and 10D7 (anti-subunit a) were used at a concentration of 5 μg/ml each per immunoprecipitation and antibody anti-HA at 10 μg/ml. A control (antibody alone) which did not have the cell lysate added was incubated in parallel under the same conditions. After a 100-μl addition of the 40% suspension protein A-Sepharose, mixtures were incubated on ice for 1 h, and V-ATPase complexes were immunoprecipitated. Beads were spun down and washed twice with immunobuffer (10 mm Tris·HCl, pH 8.0, 0.1% Triton X-100 (v/v), 2 mm EDTA). Immunoprecipitated proteins were solubilized from the beads by incubation at 65–70 °C for 30 min in cracking buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 6.8, 8 m urea, 5% SDS, 1 mm EDTA, 5% β-mercaptoethanol) at a concentration of 6–10 A600 of the original cell culture per μl of cracking buffer. Immunoprecipitates were subjected to SDS-PAGE and analyzed by Western blots. Immunoprecipitation of biosynthetically labeled cells was as described before (25.Parra K.J. Kane P.M. Mol. Cell.

Briefly, cells were grown to mid-log phase (0.5 A600/ml) in minimal medium lacking methionine or lacking methionine and the nutritional marker uracil. Cells were converted to spheroplasts by zymolase treatment and biosynthetically labeled with Tran35S-label. Labeled spheroplasts were lysed in PBS containing 1% C12E9 and protease inhibitors in the presence of 1 mm dithiobis[succinimidyl propionate]. V-ATPase was immunoprecipitated under nondenaturing conditions (23.Kane P.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 17025-17032Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 25.Parra K.J. Kane P.M. Mol.

Gels were dried, scanned in a Fuji Scanner 5100, and analyzed using the Multi Gauge and Sigma Plot software. When reversible disassembly was studied, excess unlabeled cysteine and methionine were added immediately after labeling. Chases were performed in the presence of 2% glucose (20 min in YEPD medium plus 1.2 m sorbitol), in the absence of glucose (10 min in YEP medium plus 1.2 m sorbitol), and after glucose readdition (10 min in YEP medium plus 1.2 m sorbitol and 2% glucose added) (25.Parra K.J.

Secondary structure prediction of the 409 residues forming the N terminus of subunit a showed primarily α-helical (49%) and coiled (39%) composition (Fig. 1A) (35.Bryson K. McGuffin L.J. Marsden R.L. Ward J.J. Sodhi J.S. Jones D.T. Nucleic Acids Res. 2005; 33: W36-8Crossref PubMed Scopus (625) Google Scholar). Amino acids 362–407, which represent the tether that connects the N-terminal and C-terminal domains, are predicted to be mainly coiled. Although the N-terminal domain is poorly conserved, the residues at its tether exhibit 56% conservation (37% identity) between yeast and mouse isoforms. To address the role of its conserved tether, we deleted the entire region by site-directed mutagenesis (Fig. 1A). VPH1 containing two copies of the antigenic sequence HA immediately after residue Asn-185 (28.Kawasaki-Nishi S. Nishi T. Forgac M. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 17941-17948Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar) was used as the template. Because V-ATPase subunit a is encoded by two structural genes (VPH1 and STV1) which are functional homologues (9.Manolson M.F. Wu B. Proteau D. Taillon B.E. Roberts B.T. Hoyt M.A. Jones E.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 14064-14074Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), complete deletion of the yeast subunit a requires disruption of both genes. We transformed vph1Δstv1Δ yeast cells, which lack subunit a, with the wild-type allele of subunit a (VPH1) and the truncation construct (VPH1-Δ362–407) separately, each cloned in the CEN vector pRS316. Therefore, the only isoform of subunit a present was HA-tagged Vph1 (wild type or mutant) expressed from pRS316 under control of its natural promoter. Transformants were selected on SD−Ura plates adjusted to pH 5 because disruption of yeast V-ATPase function results in a distinctive vacuolar membrane ATPase (vma) phenotype that displays growth sensitivity to pH (36.Nelson H.

To assess effects of molecular oxygen on TNFR2 expression, we subjected cultured human dermal microvascular ECs (HDMECs) to hypoxic conditions (1% O2) or to hypoxic conditions followed by return to normoxic conditions. TNFR2 mRNA and protein are expressed under normoxic conditions but are rapidly reduced by hypoxia; they fall even further upon reoxygenation but rebound by 6–9 h. TNFR1 expression is unaffected by hypoxia or reoxygenation in these same cells. We identified a potential FOXO3a binding site in the 5′ enhancer region of the TNFR2 gene. FOXO3a from normoxic but not hypoxic HDMECs binds an oligonucleotide sequence matching this site, and the endogenous enhancer binds FOXO3a at this site in HDMECs under normoxic but not hypoxic conditions. Unphosphorylated FOXO3a is present in the nucleus of HDMECs under normoxic conditions. Hypoxia leads to FOXO3a phosphorylation at an Akt/protein kinase B target site and subsequent nuclear export; these processes are reversed by reoxygenation and blocked by LY294002, a phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase inhibitor that blocks Akt activation. LY294002 also prevents the hypoxia-mediated decrease in TNFR2 expression. Transiently transfected FOXO3a activates a TNFR2 promoter/reporter construct in HDMECs, whereas small interference RNA knockdown of FOXO3a reduces TNFR2 but not TNFR1 expression under normoxic conditions. Reduction in TNFR2 by small interference RNA sensitizes HDMECs to TNFR1-mediated apoptosis. We conclude that FOXO3a regulates oxygen-dependent changes in expression of TNFR2 in HDMECs, controlling sensitivity to TNF-mediated apoptosis.

Czechowski M. Schobersberger W. Fürhapter C. Sepp N. Exp. Dermatol. 2004; 13: 113-119Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar). However, the net biological effects on these cells are complex and variable. For example, under certain circumstances, TNF may induce EC apoptosis while at other times it may promote EC proliferation and angiogenesis (5.Deshpande S.S. Angkeow P. Huang J. Ozaki M. Irani K. FASEB J. 2000; 14: 1705-1714Crossref PubMed Scopus (199) Google Scholar, 6.Grethe S. Coltella N. Di Renzo M.F. Pörn-Ares M.I. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2006; 347: 781-790Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). Some of this complexity may be explained by time-dependent alterations in signaling complexes. For example, TNF may promote activation of NF-κB within 10 min and switch over to activation of c-Jun N-terminal kinase and p38 MAPK (7.Yamanaka Y. Abu-Amer Y. Faccio R. Clohisy J.C. J. Orthop. Res. 2006; 24: 1349-1357Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar) in a response that is also self-limited. After a lag of several hours, TNF may promote autocatalytic activation of pro-caspase 8, initiating an apoptotic signaling pathway (8.Qin Z.H. Wang Y. Kikly K.K. Sapp E. Kegel K.B. Aronin N.

However, caspase 8 activation may be opposed by genes that are induced by NF-κB such as c-FLIP (10.Schattenberg J.M. Galle P.R. Schuchmann M. Liver Int. 2006; 26: 904-911Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar). Further complexities in the response may be attributed to the existence of two distinct TNF receptors, TNFR1 (CD120a), which initiates the pathways just described, and TNFR2 (CD120b), which initiates a PI3K/Akt signaling pathway via recruitment and activation of endothelial/epithelial tyrosine kinase (11.He Y.

TNFR1 may also activate PI3K/Akt but appears to do so more indirectly, e.g. via generation of sphingosine 1-phosphate, which, in turn, engages a G protein-coupled receptor on ECs (16.De Palma C. Meacci E. Perrotta C. Bruni P. Clementi E. Arterioscler. Thromb. Vasc. Biol. 2006; 26: 99-105Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar). Once activated, Akt (also known as protein kinase B) can inhibit apoptosis by several mechanisms, including the phosphorylation of the FOXO3a transcription factor, which is then excluded from the cell nucleus (17.Rena G. Woods Y.L. Prescott A.R. Peggie M. Unterman T.G. Williams M.R. Cohen P. EMBO J. 2002; 21: 2263-2271Crossref PubMed Scopus (197) Google Scholar). This response is thought to be protective, because several known genes controlled by FOXO3a contribute to apoptosis through either mitochondrial or TNFR1-dependent pathways (18.Lee H.H. Dadgostar H. Cheng Q. Shu J. Cheng G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 1999; 96: 9136-9141Crossref PubMed Scopus (482) Google Scholar). The role of FOXO3a may be more nuanced than originally thought. Like p53, it may contribute to genome repair and cell cycle arrest and, only if these fail, initiate apoptosis (19.Tran H. Brunet A. Grenier J.M. Datta S.R. Fornace Jr., A.J. DiStefano P.S. Chiang L.W. Greenberg M.E. Science. 2002; 296: 530-534Crossref PubMed Scopus (691) Google Scholar). We have recently described another layer of regulation of TNF responses, namely differential control of TNFR1 and TNFR2 expression (20.Al-Lamki R.S. Wang J. Vandenabeele P. Bradley J.A. Thiru S. Luo D. Min W. Pober J.S. Bradley J.R. FASEB J. 2005; 19: 1637-1645Crossref PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar). In healthy human kidney specimens, TNFR1 is expressed mainly on microvascular and glomerular ECs, whereas TNFR2 expression is barely detectable on any cell type. Following ischemia/reperfusion injury, TNFR1 expression is lost from ECs, being replaced by the structurally related protein death receptor 3 (DR3), and TNFR2 is induced on both ECs and renal tubular epithelial cells (21.Cornell L.D. Smith R.N. Colvin R.B. Annu. Rev. Pathol. 2008; 3: 189-220Crossref PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar). These alterations in protein levels are correlated with changes in mRNA expression, suggesting that receptor levels are controlled at the level of gene transcription. Treatment of renal organ cultures with TNF or with TL1A, the ligand of DR3, can mimic the changes in TNFR1 and TNFR2 mRNA and protein levels seen in ischemia/reperfusion injury (22.Al-Lamki R.S. Wang J. Thiru S. Pritchard N.R. Bradley J.A. Pober J.S. Bradley J.R. Am. J. Pathol. 2003; 163: 401-411Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). However, we have not observed regulation of TNFR1 or TNFR2 by TNF or TL1A in cultured ECs. tumor necrosis factor TNF receptor death receptor 3 endothelial cell human dermal microvascular EC mitogen-activated protein kinase phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase chromatin immunoprecipitation small interference RNA phosphate-buffered saline cycloheximide. tumor necrosis factor TNF receptor death receptor 3 endothelial cell human dermal microvascular EC mitogen-activated protein kinase phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase chromatin immunoprecipitation small interference RNA phosphate-buffered saline cycloheximide. We are particularly interested in the one or more pathways by which TNFR2 expression is regulated, because selective engagement of this receptor by a mutated form of TNF that is incapable of binding TNFR1 exhibits little of the pro-apoptotic properties of the wild-type cytokine but retains at least some of the protective effects. We have chosen to begin our investigation of TNFR2 expression in the well characterized culture system of human dermal microvascular ECs (HDMECs). HDMECs, like most other cultured cells, express both TNFR1 and TNFR2 under standard culture conditions. As an initial approach to investigate ischemia/reperfusion injury, we manipulated the oxygen tension of the culture system, going from normoxia to hypoxia and back again. Here we report that hypoxia leads to a fall in TNFR2 mRNA with a further fall followed by a rebound upon reoxygenation. We present evidence that these changes in TNFR2 transcription are in part controlled by FOXO3a and that TNFR2 mediates cytoprotective effects in HDMECs. HDMECs were isolated by the cell culture core of the Yale Skin Disease Research Center from discarded skin under a protocol approved by the Yale Human Investigation Committee and cultured in EGM-2 medium supplemented with EGM-2® MV singleQuots (Lonza, Walkersville, MD) as described (23.Kluger M.S. Shiao S.L. Bothwell A.L. Pober J.S. J. Immunol. 2002; 168: 2091-2095Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). Experiments were conducted with cells at passage levels 2–4. To create conditions of hypoxia and reoxygenation, passaged HDMECs were seeded at low density and cultured for 2 days at room air plus 5% CO2 to a density of ∼50–60% visual confluence and then transferred to 1% O2 and 5% CO2 in a controlled environment chamber (Proox model C21, Biopherix, Redfield, NY) for up to 6 h as indicated in the text. Reoxygenation was achieved by transferring the cultures back to 21% O2 plus 5% CO2 for up to 12 h as indicated in the text. Where indicated, Ly294002 (20 μm, Sigma-Aldrich) or an equivalent volume of DMSO (Sigma, vehicle control) was added 15 min prior to exposure to hypoxia. At the end of the experiment, cells were fixed and analyzed by immunofluorescence microscopy or were harvested by adding lysis buffer directly on ice and analyzed by immunoblotting, chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP), or oligonucleotide binding as indicated in the text. To knock down gene expression, HDMECs were transfected separately with FOXO3a siRNA duplexes (Sigma), designated as siRNA1 (5′-CUCUGAACUCCCUACGCCATT-3′), siRNA2 (5′-UUAACAGCACGGTGTTCGGTT-3′), or siRNA3 (5′-GAAUGAUGGGCUGACUGAATT-3′), or with control siRNA (Qiagen Allstar control siRNA) using Lipofectamine 2000 and incubated 48 h before experimentation. The final concentration of siRNA was 60 pmol/ml. The same procedure was used to knock down TNFR2 using a validated siRNA (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Santa Cruz, CA). For assays of reporter genes, HDMECs were cotransfected using nucleoelectroporation (Amaxa, Inc., Gaithersburg, MD) with either pGL-FOXO/pCMV-HA-FOXO3A or pGL-HIF/pCMV-HA-FOXO3A (control) as well as with pSVβgal (as an internal efficiency control, Promega, Madison, WI) at the point when the cells were at 95% visual confluence, and cells were trypsinized for nucleoelectroporation. The pGL-FOXO reporter gene was constructed by inserting a 156-bp PCR segment (from −882 to −1038) of the TNFR2 5′-flanking region into the KpnI/BglII site of the pGL3 vector. The PGL-HIF reporter gene, used as a control, was constructed by inserting a 140-bp PCR segment (from −596 to −736) of the TNFR2 5′-flanking region into the KpnI/BglII site of the pGL3 vector. The pCMV-HA-FOXO3a expression vector was constructed by cutting HA-FOXO3A from pECE-HA-FOXO3A (Addgene Inc., Cambridge, MA) and transferring to pCDNA3.0 (Invitrogen). The activity of luciferase was detected after 48 h incubation using a luciferase assay kit (Promega) according to the manufacturer's instructions. The results of both siRNA knockdown and of plasmid expression were confirmed by immunoblotting or fluorescence-activated cell sorting analysis as described (23.Kluger M.S. Shiao S.L. Bothwell A.L. Pober J.S. J. Immunol. 2002; 168: 2091-2095Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar) using a mouse anti-human TNFR2 antibody (ABCAM clone MR2, catalog no. Ab8161). Antibodies used for immunoblotting included: anti-hsTNFR2 (R&D System, catalog no. MAB226, Minneapolis, MN), anti-TNFR1 (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, catalog no. sc-8436), anti-β-actin (Sigma), anti-Foxo3a (Cell Signaling, catalog no. 9467, Boston, MA), anti-phospho-Foxo3a (Cell Signaling, catalog no. 9466S), and goat anti-goat or rabbit IgG-conjugated fluorescein isothiocyanate or Texas Red (Santa Cruz Biotechnology). At times indicated in the text, HDMECs were harvested with trypsin (Invitrogen) and washed three times with ice-cold PBS. Lysis buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 10% of glycerol, 1% of Triton X-100, 300 mm NaCl, 150 mm KCl, 5 mm EDTA, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 0.5 mm Na3VO4, 10 mm NaF, 10 mm iodoacetamide, and protease inhibitors) or SDS gel buffer with β-mercaptoethanol (Laemmli sample buffer, Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA) was then added, and the lysates were cleared of debris by centrifugation. Total protein concentration of the clarified lysates was determined using Bradford reagent as described by the manufacturer (Bio-Rad). 80 μg of total protein/sample was subjected to 4–15% gradient SDS-PAGE and electrophoretically transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride membranes. Protein blots on the membrane were identified by using specific primary antibodies followed by horseradish peroxidase-conjugated anti-IgG secondary antibodies in blocking buffer. Images were obtained by chemiluminescence on x-ray film using ECL reagents (LumiGLO Reserve Chemiluminescent substrate kit, KPL, Gaithersburg, MD). Isolated HDMECs were cross-linked by addition of 3% formaldehyde. Genomic DNA was sheared by sonication and purified by using the Nuclear/Cytosol Fractionation kit (BioVision, catalog no. k266-25, Dublin, OH). Anti-FOXO3a antibody was used to pull down complexes of FOXO3a-binding DNA (Chromatin Immunoprecipitation Assay Kit, Upstate). PCR amplification of the precipitated DNA was conducted with one set of primers that flank a putative FOXO3a binding site in the 5′-flanking region of the TNFR2 gene: forward (5′-GAGCAGGGAAGTGCAGAGTC-3′) and backward (5′-ATGTTGTCCAGGCTGGTCTC-3′). Control primers flanked a putative FOXO3a binding sequence located in the first intron: forward (5′-GCGCTGGAGTTAGATCCCTA-3′) and backward (5′-GGAGCAATCTGCCACTCTTC-3′). DNA binding by proteins in HDMEC lysates was examined using a biotinylated double-stranded oligonucleotide (24.Hata A. Seoane J. Lagna G. Montalvo E. Hemmati-Brivanlou A. Massagué J. Cell. 2000; 100: 229-240Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (365) Google Scholar) containing a FOXO3a binding motif sequence, 5′-CCTGTGAGAAGGCTGGATGCGTGTTTAAGGATAAATGAACACGCGAAGAGTAGTAACAACAGCCAAGATTTATAAATGCCTATTGTTATATATGTAGATACTTACTTAAGTATATATAAAGTACAGACTGCATTATGTATATTACATATCTTTAAA-3′ (sense strand), as well as a control biotinylated double-stranded oligonucleotide containing a HIF-binding motif sequence, 5′-CTCTAGAGTCTAAACAGGCCGAGTGCAGTGGCTCACACCTATAATCCCAGCACCTTGGGAGGCCAGAGGCGGGAAGATCACTTGAGGGTGGGAAGAACACGTGAGCTCAGGAGTTCGAGACCAGCCTGGACAACATGGCG-3′ (sense strand). The DNA and target protein complexes were pulled down using streptavidin agarose. Beads were washed, boiled, and centrifuged. The supernatants were then subjected to immunoblotting blot to detect FOXO3a. HDMEC cultures grown on coverslips were fixed in methanol/acetone (1:1) for 20 min at −20 °C. Anti-TNFR2 antibody (R&D Systems) or Anti-Foxo3a antibody (Cell Signaling) were separately added (1:200 in 10% goat serum in PBS) and incubated overnight at 4 °C. Goat anti-goat or rabbit IgG-conjugated fluorescein isothiocyanate or Texas Red (1:200) were added, and the mixture was incubated 45 min at room temperature. The coverslips were washed with PBS and air-dried. Slide covers were sealed with anti-fade solution containing 4′,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole for nuclear identification (H1200, Vector Laboratories, Burlingame, CA). Slides were viewed on a fluorescence microscope (Nikon, Japan). HDMECs were plated into 100- × 20-mm tissue culture dishes and allowed to grow to confluence. Confluent cultures were transfected with an siRNA for TNFR2 or a control siRNA as described above and allowed to rest for 48 h. Cells were then passaged into 24-well plates for TNF and cycloheximide (CHX) cytotoxicity assays. Cells were either untreated or treated with 10 μg/ml CHX (Calbiochem) and with a variable concentration of TNF, as indicated, for 18 h. Floating HDMECs were collected and pooled with residual attached HDMECs suspended by trypsin treatment. The pooled HDMECs were washed once in PBS and resuspended in PBS containing propidium iodide (50 μg/ml, Sigma). The percentage of cell death was determined by fluorescence-activated cell sorting analysis using FloJo Software (TreeStar, Ashland OR). Where indicated, multigroup comparisons were analyzed by analysis of variance. Cytotoxicity data were analyzed by using a paired t-test. To elucidate the mechanism of altered TNFR2 expression induced in vivo by ischemia/reperfusion injury, we analyzed the response of cultured human microvascular ECs to changes in oxygen tension using the well studied HDMEC culture system. Under “normoxic” culture conditions (21% O2), we found that HDMECs express TNFR2 mRNA and protein as detected by quantitative reverse transcription-PCR and immunoblotting, respectively (FIGURE 1, FIGURE 2). Upon reduction of O2 to 1%, both TNFR2 mRNA and protein expression fell within 30–60 min. After 6 h of hypoxia, TNFR2 remained at reduced levels. When the cells were then restored to normoxic conditions, TNFR2 mRNA initially fell further and then reappeared by 3–6 h, peaked at 9 h at levels above control cultures not exposed to hypoxia, and then returned to pre-hypoxic levels (Fig. 3). TNFR2 protein re-expression followed that of mRNA but did not appear to overshoot levels in normoxic controls. TNFR1 mRNA and protein levels were unaffected by hypoxia or by reoxygenation (Fig. 1 and data not shown), indicating that this is not a global effect on gene expression in HDMECs.FIGURE 2Effects of hypoxia on TNFR2 protein levels. HDMECs were treated as in Fig. 1, and TNFR2 protein was analyzed by immunoblotting as described under “Experimental Procedures.” A chemiluminescence image is shown in A, and a densitometric quantitation of the same image is shown in B. Note that protein levels fall to ∼40% of the levels in normoxic cells. Data represent one of three experiments with similar results, although the kinetics varied slightly among different experiments.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)FIGURE 3Effects of hypoxia and reoxygenation on TNFR2 mRNA and protein levels. HDMECs were subjected to hypoxia followed by reoxygenation and TNFR2 mRNA (A) and protein (B and C) were quantified as in FIGURE 1, FIGURE 2. Note that mRNA levels recover sooner than those of protein, which actually fall further upon reoxygenation, and that mRNA but not protein levels transiently overshoot the levels in normoxic cells. Data represent one of three experiments with similar results, although the kinetics varied among different experiments. TNFR2 mRNA was significantly reduced by 6 h (p < 0.05). Levels remained significantly lower (p < 0.05) until 6 h of re-oxygenation whereby they significantly increased by 9 h and returned to baseline by 18 h.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Because changes in mRNA levels generally correlated with alterations in protein expression (although the kinetics varied among different experiments), we considered the hypothesis that TNFR2 expression might be mediated by oxygen tension through control of gene transcription. We analyzed the 5′-flanking region of the TNFR2 gene for the presence of possible oxygen regulatory sequences and identified a potential FOXO3a binding site at position −1011 (Fig. 4A). We then performed ChIP analysis and found this site to be occupied by FOXO3a in HDMECs cultured under normoxic conditions and that occupancy was lost as early as 10 min of exposure to hypoxia (Fig. 4B). A second potential FOXO3a binding site located in the coding region of the gene was not occupied by FOXO3a in either normoxic or hypoxic HDMECs. The findings of our ChIP analysis were supported by an oligonucleotide binding assay in which FOXO3a could be pulled down using the relevant but not an irrelevant (putative HIF-1 binding) sequence from normoxic but not hypoxic HDMECs (Fig. 4C). In other cell systems, regulation of FOXO3a is mediated by Akt-catalyzed phosphorylation, which leads to nuclear export and sequestration in the cytosol (25.Krol J. Francis R.E. Albergaria A. Sunters A. Polychronis A. Coombes R.C. Lam E.W. Mol. Cancer Ther. 2007; 6: 3169-3179Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). To determine if this mechanism is operational in HDMECs, we examined the subcellular location of FOXO3a in HDMECs under normoxic and hypoxic conditions (Fig. 5). We observed that FOXO3a is localized to the nucleus, identified by 4′,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole costaining, in normoxic cells, but is translocated to the cytosol under hypoxic conditions. Reoxygenation leads to re-localization to the nucleus. Only cytosolic FOXO3a under hypoxic conditions appears to be phosphorylated by Akt, detected with a phospho-FOXO3a-specific antibody, and prevention of the activation of Akt with the PI3K inhibitor Ly294002 prevents hypoxia-induced export of FOXO3a from the nucleus. Ly294002 also prevents the reduction of TNFR2 mRNA (Fig. 1) and protein expression (Fig. 6) observed in hypoxic conditions.FIGURE 6Effects of PI3K inhibition on the response to hypoxia. A, Ly294002 treatment prevents the hypoxia-induced decline of TNFR2 protein levels in cultured HDMECs as assessed by immunoblotting. B, densitometric quantitation of the chemiluminescence results in panel A. Note that, in this experiment, PI3K inhibition actually leads to a superinduction of TNFR2 expression. Data represent one of four experiments with similar results.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) In the next series of experiments, we examined if FOXO3a could directly control the transcription of TNFR2 in HDMECs under normoxic conditions. First, we transiently transfected HDMECs with two TNFR2 promoter-reporter genes (using the sequences identified in Fig. 7A) and cotransfected both a FOXO3a expression vector and a control expression vector or only the control vector. Overexpression of exogenous FOXO3a increased the expression level of the TNFR2 promoter-reporter gene containing the FOXO3a binding element but had no effect on the expression of the TNFR2 promoter-reporter gene lacking the FOXO3a binding site (Fig. 7B). Finally, we reduced the expression of endogenous FOXO3a using siRNA. Two siRNAs that efficiently reduced FOXO3a expression in HDMECs efficiently reduced TNFR2 mRNA, whereas a third siRNA that was less effective at reducing FOXO3a less effectively reduced TNFR2 mRNA (Fig. 8A). None of the three siRNAs nor a control siRNA had any effect on TNFR1 mRNA. TNFR2 protein was proportionately reduced to the knockdown of FOXO3A protein (Fig. 8B).FIGURE 8Effect of siRNA knock down of FOXO3a on expression of endogenous TNFR1 and TNFR2 in HDMECs. A, comparison of the effects of three different siRNA sequences that target FOXO3a on mRNA expression levels of FOXO3a, TNFR2, and TNFR2. These results were highly significant (p < 0.05) for both the FOXO3a and TNFR2 mRNA with the exception of “D” in the TNFR2 group. There was no reduction in FOXO3a expression on TNFR1 expression. Data represent one of three experiments with similar results. B, effect of a FOXO3a siRNA sequence (siRNA3 in panel A) on both FOXO3a and TNFR2 protein expression; note the co-ordinate reduction with increasing siRNA concentration. C, densitometric quantitation of the chemiluminescence image in panel B.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) In a final series of experiments, we asked if reduction of TNFR2 expression as caused by hypoxia could affect the response of HDMECs to TNF. In pilot experiments, we had observed that hypoxia produces a global inhibition of cytokine-induced protein synthesis, which would confound any simple interpretation. Therefore, we chose instead to reduce expression of TNFR2 by means of siRNA transfection and then to assess the response to killing of HDMECs by the combination of TNF plus CHX. This response is known to be mediated by TNF binding to TNFR1, and we thus asked if the absence of TNFR2 would increase EC injury as had been observed in vivo (13.Luo D. Luo Y. He Y. Zhang H. Zhang R. Li X. Dobrucki W.L. Sinusas A.J. Sessa W.C. Min W. Am. J. Pathol. 2006; 169: 1886-1898Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar). In three of three experiments, we observed an increase in the sensitivity of HDMECs to killing by TNF proportional in each case to the extent of knock down of TNFR2 on the cell surface (Fig. 9 and data not shown). Our siRNA results, oligonucleotide binding data, ChIP data, and reporter gene experiments collectively establish that TNFR2 transcription in cultured HDMECs depends upon FOXO3a under normoxic conditions. Our immunofluorescence experiments, oligonucleotide binding data, ChIP data, and pharmacological inhibition experiments indicate that TNFR2 transcription is down-regulated in response to hypoxia through PI3K/Akt-mediated phosphorylation and nuclear export of FOXO3a. Furthermore, we observe a further fall in expression upon reoxygenation followed by rebound of expression. The mechanism for further rapid reduction of mRNA upon reoxygenation is unclear and implies that there must be additional levels of regulation. The delayed rebound appears related to reappearance of dephosphorylated FOXO3a in the nuclear compartment. FOXO3a may be phosphorylated by several different kinases, including Akt, SGK, CK1, DYRK1A, and Ral (26.Van Der Heide L.P. Hoekman M.F. Smidt M.P. Biochem. J. 2004; 380: 297-309Crossref PubMed Scopus (537) Google Scholar). We believe that our data are most consistent with an Akt response, because the phospho-FOXO3a species detected with our antibody is directed toward the species that is generated by Akt (phosphorylated on Ser residue 253) and because the generation of this species was blocked by preventing the activation of Akt through inhibition of PI3K. The inhibition of FOXO3a function by its phosphorylation represents an adaptive response to hypoxia, inhibiting the transcription of target genes known to contribute to apoptosis (27.Mandinova A. Lefort K. Tommasi di Vignano A. Stonely W. Ostano P. Chiorino G. Iwaki H. Nakanishi J. Dotto G.P. EMBO J. 2008; 27: 1243-1254Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). Consistent with this interpretation, it has recently been reported that adenovirally transduced overexpression of FOXO3a in cultured human umbilical vein ECs leads to increased expression of several TNF pathway genes that contribute to apoptosis, including TNF itself, TANK, and TTRAP. TNF treatment of these modified cells led to diminished NF-κB signaling and increased JNK signaling, contributing to cell death (28.Lee H.Y. Youn S.W. Kim J.Y. Park K.W. Hwang C.I. Park W.Y. Oh B.H. Park Y.B. Walsh K. Seo J.S. Kim H.S. Arterioscler. Thromb. Vasc. Biol. 2008; 28: 112-120Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). The induction of TNFR2 transcription by FOXO3a in HDMECs reported here, which was not described in human umbilical vein ECs, appears to defy this pattern, because this receptor is principally linked to cell survival and proliferation, largely through activation of PI3K and Akt. In other words, the induction of TNFR2 by FOXO3a likely represents a negative feedback loop leading to the activation of a pathway that inhibits FOXO3a function. Reduction of TNFR2 by siRNA knockdown does render HDMECs more sensitive to TNFR1-mediated killing, consistent with this idea. It is our experience 3B. Ding and J. S. Pober, unpublished observations. that hypoxic regulation of FOXO3a is more pronounced in HDMECs than in human umbilical vein ECs, although the basis of this difference is unclear. The transcriptional control of TNFR2 is incompletely understood. As noted earlier, we have observed induction of TNFR2 in organ culture in response to TNF and to TL1A (20.Al-Lamki R.S. Wang J. Vandenabeele P. Bradley J.A. Thiru S. Luo D. Min W. Pober J.S. Bradley J.R. FASEB J. 2005; 19: 1637-1645Crossref PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar, 29.Al-Lamki R.S. Wang J. Tolkovsky A.M.

The TNF response appears to be mediated through TNFR2, as assessed by the response to receptor-specific mutein forms of TNF (20.Al-Lamki R.S. Wang J. Vandenabeele P. Bradley J.A. Thiru S. Luo D. Min W. Pober J.S. Bradley J.R. FASEB J. 2005; 19: 1637-1645Crossref PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar), and the response to TL1A occurs in mouse kidney tissue harvested from DR3-deficient mice (29.Al-Lamki R.S. Wang J. Tolkovsky A.M. Bradley J.A. Griffin J.L. Thiru S. Wang E.C. Bolton E. Min W. Moore P. Pober J.S. Bradley J.R. J. Am. Soc. Nephrol. 2008; 19: 953-960Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar), DR3 being the only known receptor for TL1A. In both cases, the induction of TNFR2 was not reduced by effective pharmacological inhibition of NF-κB activation (29.Al-Lamki R.S. Wang J. Tolkovsky A.M. Bradley J.A. Griffin J.L. Thiru S. Wang E.C. Bolton E. Min W. Moore P. Pober J.S. Bradley J.R. J. Am. Soc. Nephrol. 2008; 19: 953-960Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). In addition to the FOXO3a site we have identified in this study, there are a number of other potential regulatory sequences in the 5′-flanking region of the human (30.Santee S.M. Owen-Schaub L.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 21151-21159Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar) and mouse (31.Seitz C. Männel D.N. Hehlgans T. Genomics. 1998; 48: 111-116Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar) TNFR2 gene, including motifs for binding of transcription factors T cell factor 1, Ikaros, AP-1, CK-2, interleukin-6 receptor E, ISRE, GAS, NF-κB, Sp1, CREB, Yi, and YY1. One previous report (32.Hehlgans T. Seitz C. Lewis C. Männel D.N. J. Interferon Cytokine Res. 2001; 21: 757-762Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar) examined the response of TNFR2 in murine NIH 3T3 cells to hypoxia and reoxygenation. These investigators saw an increase in expression but ruled out a role for HIF-1 or HIF-2 and instead identified a response to NF-interleukin-6. We do not understand the basis of the differences between the response of HDMECs and murine 3T3 cells, but they could be species- and/or cell type-dependent. No previous reports have implicated a role for forkhead family transcriptional control of TNFR2 in any cell type. In summary, we have described a novel pathway of regulation of TNFR2 expression in cultured HDMECs involving PI3K, Akt, and the FOXO3a transcription factor. Nuclear FOXO3a drives TNFR2 in normoxic conditions, and its inactivation by hypoxia results in reduced expression of this receptor. Because FOXO3a mediates EC apoptosis and TNFR2 mediates resistance to apoptosis, this pathway could function as a negative feedback loop."
