https://openalex.org/W2024168869,It has recently been suggested that the solar irradiance has varied in phase with the 80- to 90-year period represented by the envelope of the 11-year sunspot cycle and that this variation is causing a significant part of the changes in the global temperature. This interpretation has been criticized for statistical reasons and because there are no observations that indicate significant changes in the solar irradiance. A set of data that supports the suggestion of a direct influence of solar activity on global climate is the variation of the solar cycle length. This record closely matches the long-term variations of the Northern Hemisphere land air temperature during the past 130 years.

Application of climate-pollen response surfaces to three climate model simulations of doubled preindustrial atmospheric CO(2) levels shows that the change in the equilibrium distribution of natural vegetation over eastern North America over the next 200 to 500 years could be larger than the overall change during the past 7,000 to 10,000 years and equivalent to the change that took place over the 1,000- to 3,000-year period of most rapid deglaciation. Some plant ranges and abundance maxima could shift as much as 500 to 1000 km during the next 200 to 500 years; such changes would have dramatic impacts on silvicultural and natural ecosystems. Although unprecedented vegetation change is likely if climate changes as predicted, forecasting the exact timing and patterns of change will be difficult."
https://openalex.org/W1980708147,An in situ scanning tunneling microscope (STM) was used to observe the morphological changes accompanying the selective dissolution of Ag from low-Ag content Ag-Au alloys in dilute perchloric acid. This study was undertaken to explore the role of surface diffusion in alloy corrosion processes. These results are interpreted within the framework of the kink-ledge-terrace model of a crystal surface and a recent model of alloy corrosion based on a variant of percolation theory. The corrosion process leads to roughening of the surface by dissolution of Ag atoms from terrace sites. Annealing or smoothening of the surface occurs by vacancy migration through clusters and the subsequent annihilation of clusters at terrace ledges.

No other fossils of this group have been reported. Although this new hagfish differs from living forms in position of the gills, feeding apparatus, and relatively well developed eyes, it is quite similar to its recent relatives. Thus, hagfishes have a long, conservative geological history. Cladograms showing myxinoids as a sister group to the vertebrates are supported."

Associated faunas suggest an Early Cambrian age for these strata. These now earliest known unequivocal foraminifera help constrain hypotheses concerning the origin of skeletalization at the beginning of the Phanerozoic."
https://openalex.org/W2094014279,"Structural, petrological, and geochronological studies of the middle to late Proterozoic Grenville orogen in Ontario, Canada, indicate that a major extensional fault developed synchronously with late thrusting. This fault zone was initiated during peak metamorphism and extended into the crust to depths of at least 25 kilometers. The temporal and spatial relations among faulting, metamorphism, and regional compression indicate that synorogenic collapse initiated because the crust exceeded the maximum physiographic height and thickness that could be supported by its rheology. Comparison of Grenville with recent Himalayan orogenic activity suggests that during Proterozoic times physiographic height, crustal thickness, and crustal strength were similar to modern conditions in orogenic belts."
https://openalex.org/W2048443594,"Voyager observations suggest that three of Neptune's major cloud features oscillate in latitude by 2 degrees to 4 degrees and that two of them simultaneously oscillate in longitude by 7.8 degrees and 98 degrees about their mean drift longitudes. The observations define most convincingly the two orthogonal oscillations of the second dark spot (near 53 degrees south). These oscillations have similar periods near 800 hours and approximately satisfy a simple advective model in which a latitudinal oscillation produces a phase-shifted longitudinal oscillation proportional to the local wind shear. The latitudinal motion of the Great Dark Spot can be fit with an oscillation period of about 2550 hours, whereas its dominant longitudinal motion, if oscillatory at all, has such a long period that it is not well constrained by the Voyager data."

https://openalex.org/W2094656554,"IT is well known that the luminescence produced in certain materials subjected to the action of the radioactive rays decreases with time and that the colour of the luminescence changes, while at the same time the material itself also changes in colour. From experimental work covering more than two years and still under way, we are led to believe that the decrease in luminescence of phosphorescent zinc sulphide, etc., is probably due to the masking of the radiation luminosity by the colour which the material acquires, due to the action of the radiation."
