https://openalex.org/W2028695285,"Gephi is a network visualization software used in various disciplines (social network analysis, biology, genomics…). One of its key features is the ability to display the spatialization process, aiming at transforming the network into a map, and ForceAtlas2 is its default layout algorithm. The latter is developed by the Gephi team as an all-around solution to Gephi users’ typical networks (scale-free, 10 to 10,000 nodes). We present here for the first time its functioning and settings. ForceAtlas2 is a force-directed layout close to other algorithms used for network spatialization. We do not claim a theoretical advance but an attempt to integrate different techniques such as the Barnes Hut simulation, degree-dependent repulsive force, and local and global adaptive temperatures. It is designed for the Gephi user experience (it is a continuous algorithm), and we explain which constraints it implies. The algorithm benefits from much feedback and is developed in order to provide many possibilities through its settings. We lay out its complete functioning for the users who need a precise understanding of its behaviour, from the formulas to graphic illustration of the result. We propose a benchmark for our compromise between performance and quality. We also explain why we integrated its various features and discuss our design choices."

However, configuration of these devices imposes an additional burden on clinicians relative to conventional prostheses; devices for transfemoral amputees that require configuration of both a knee and an ankle joint are especially challenging. In this paper, we present an approach to configuring such powered devices. We developed modified intrinsic control strategies—which mimic the behavior of biological joints, depend on instantaneous loads within the prosthesis, or set impedance based on values from previous states, as well as a set of starting configuration parameters. We developed tables that include a list of desired clinical gait kinematics and the parameter modifications necessary to alter them. Our approach was implemented for a powered knee and ankle prosthesis in five ambulation modes (level-ground walking, ramp ascent/descent, and stair ascent/descent). The strategies and set of starting configuration parameters were developed using data from three individuals with unilateral transfemoral amputations who had previous experience using the device; this approach was then tested on three novice unilateral transfemoral amputees. Only 17% of the total number of parameters (i.e., 24 of the 140) had to be independently adjusted for each novice user to achieve all five ambulation modes and the initial accommodation period (i.e., time to configure the device for all modes) was reduced by 56%, to 5 hours or less. This approach and subsequent reduction in configuration time may help translate powered prostheses into a viable clinical option where amputees can more quickly appreciate the benefits such devices can provide."

Lycopene is a potent antioxidant found in such diets with evidence suggesting beneficial effects. We wished to investigate the effects of lycopene on the vasculature in CVD patients and separately, in healthy volunteers (HV).We randomised 36 statin treated CVD patients and 36 healthy volunteers in a 2∶1 treatment allocation ratio to either 7 mg lycopene or placebo daily for 2 months in a double-blind trial. Forearm responses to intra-arterial infusions of acetylcholine (endothelium-dependent vasodilatation; EDV), sodium nitroprusside (endothelium-independent vasodilatation; EIDV), and NG-monomethyl-L-arginine (basal nitric oxide (NO) synthase activity) were measured using venous plethysmography. A range of vascular and biochemical secondary endpoints were also explored. EDV in CVD patients post-lycopene improved by 53% (95% CI: +9% to +93%, P = 0.03 vs. placebo) without changes to EIDV, or basal NO responses. HVs did not show changes in EDV after lycopene treatment. Blood pressure, arterial stiffness, lipids and hsCRP levels were unchanged for lycopene vs. placebo treatment groups in the CVD arm as well as the HV arm. At baseline, CVD patients had impaired EDV compared with HV (30% lower; 95% CI: -45% to -10%, P = 0.008), despite lower LDL cholesterol (1.2 mmol/L lower, 95% CI: -1.6 to -0.9 mmol/L, P<0.001). Post-therapy EDV responses for lycopene-treated CVD patients were similar to HVs at baseline (2% lower, 95% CI: -30% to +30%, P = 0.85), also suggesting lycopene improved endothelial function.Lycopene supplementation improves endothelial function in CVD patients on optimal secondary prevention, but not in HVs.ClinicalTrials.gov NCT01100385."
https://openalex.org/W2024735394,"Reactive oxygen and nitrogen species can have either harmful or beneficial effects on biological systems depending on the dose administered and the species of organism exposed, suggesting that application of reactive species can possibly produce contradictory effects in disease control, pathogen inactivation and activation of host resistance. A novel technology known as atmospheric-pressure non-thermal plasma represents a means of generating various reactive species that adversely affect pathogens (inactivation) while simultaneously up-regulating host defense genes. The anti-microbial efficacy of this technology was tested on the plant fungal pathogen Fusarium oxysporum f.sp. lycopersici and its susceptible host plant species Solanum lycopercicum. Germination of fungal spores suspended in saline was decreased over time after exposed to argon (Ar) plasma for 10 min. Although the majority of treated spores exhibited necrotic death, apoptosis was also observed along with the up-regulation of apoptosis related genes. Increases in the levels of peroxynitrite and nitrite in saline following plasma treatment may have been responsible for the observed spore death. In addition, increased transcription of pathogenesis related (PR) genes was observed in the roots of the susceptible tomato cultivar (S. lycopercicum) after exposure to the same Ar plasma dose used in fungal inactivation. These data suggest that atmospheric-pressure non-thermal plasma can be efficiently used to control plant fungal diseases by inactivating fungal pathogens and up-regulating mechanisms of host resistance."
https://openalex.org/W1965053868,"There is increasing evidence that acute aerobic exercise is associated with improved cognitive function. However, neural correlates of its cognitive plasticity remain largely unknown. The present study examined the effect of a session of acute aerobic exercise on working memory task-evoked brain activity as well as task performance. A within-subjects design with a counterbalanced order was employed. Fifteen young female participants (M = 19.56, SD = 0.81) were scanned using functional magnetic resonance imaging while performing a working memory task, the N-back task, both following an acute exercise session with 20 minutes of moderate intensity and a control rest session. Although an acute session of exercise did not improve behavioral performance, we observed that it had a significant impact on brain activity during the 2-back condition of the N-back task. Specifically, acute exercise induced increased brain activation in the right middle prefrontal gyrus, the right lingual gyrus, and the left fusiform gyrus as well as deactivations in the anterior cingulate cortexes, the left inferior frontal gyrus, and the right paracentral lobule. Despite the lack of an effect on behavioral measures, significant changes after acute exercise with activation of the prefrontal and occipital cortexes and deactivation of the anterior cingulate cortexes and left frontal hemisphere reflect the improvement of executive control processes, indicating that acute exercise could benefit working memory at a macro-neural level. In addition to its effects on reversing recent obesity and disease trends, our results provide substantial evidence highlighting the importance of promoting physical activity across the lifespan to prevent or reverse cognitive and neural decline."
https://openalex.org/W1965641302,"Persons with certain neurological conditions have higher mortality rates than the population without neurological conditions, but the risk factors for increased mortality within diagnostic groups are less well understood. The interRAI CHESS scale has been shown to be a strong predictor of mortality in the overall population of persons receiving health care in community and institutional settings. This study examines the performance of CHESS as a predictor of mortality among persons with 11 different neurological conditions.Survival analyses were done with interRAI assessments linked to mortality data among persons in home care (n = 359,940), complex continuing care hospitals/units (n = 88,721), and nursing homes (n = 185,309) in seven Canadian provinces/territories.CHESS was a significant predictor of mortality in all 3 care settings for the 11 neurological diagnostic groups considered after adjusting for age and sex. The distribution of CHESS scores varied between diagnostic groups and within diagnostic groups in different care settings.CHESS is a valid predictor of mortality in neurological populations in community and institutional care. It may prove useful for several clinical, administrative, policy-development, evaluation and research purposes. Because it is routinely gathered as part of normal clinical practice in jurisdictions (like Canada) that have implemented interRAI assessment instruments, CHESS can be derived without additional need for data collection."
https://openalex.org/W2002891084,"Background Growing evidence has linked autophagy to a protective role of preconditioning in liver ischemia/reperfusion (IR). Heme oxygenase-1 (HO-1) is essential in limiting inflammation and preventing the apoptotic response to IR. We previously demonstrated that HO-1 is up-regulated in liver graft after remote ischemic preconditioning (RIPC). The aim of this study was to confirm that RIPC protects against IR via HO-1-mediated autophagy. Methods RIPC was performed with regional ischemia of limbs before liver ischemia, and HO-1 activity was inhibited pre-operation. Autophagy was assessed by the expression of light chain 3-II (LC3-II). The HO-1/extracellular signal-related kinase (ERK)/p38/mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) pathway was detected in an autophagy model and mineral oil-induced IR in vitro. Results In liver IR, the expression of LC3-II peaked 12–24 h after IR, and the ultrastructure revealed abundant autophagosomes in hepatocytes after IR. Autophagy was inhibited when HO-1 was inactivated, which we believe resulted in the aggravation of liver IR injury (IRI) in vivo. Hemin-induced autophagy also protected rat hepatocytes from IRI in vitro, which was abrogated by HO-1 siRNA. Phosphorylation of p38-MAPK and ERK1/2 was up-regulated in hemin-pretreated liver cells and down-regulated after treatment with HO-1 siRNA. Conclusions RIPC may protect the liver from IRI by induction of HO-1/p38-MAPK-dependent autophagy."
https://openalex.org/W2084154378,"In plants, serine residues in extensin, a cell wall protein, are glycosylated with O-linked galactose. However, the enzyme that is involved in the galactosylation of serine had not yet been identified. To identify the peptidyl serine O-α-galactosyltransferase (SGT), we chose Chlamydomonas reinhardtii as a model. We established an assay system for SGT activity using C. reinhardtii and Arabidopsis thaliana cell extracts. SGT protein was partially purified from cell extracts of C. reinhardtii and analyzed by tandem mass spectrometry to determine its amino acid sequence. The sequence matched the open reading frame XP_001696927 in the C. reinhardtii proteome database, and a corresponding DNA fragment encoding 748 amino acids (BAL63043) was cloned from a C. reinhardtii cDNA library. The 748-amino acid protein (CrSGT1) was produced using a yeast expression system, and the SGT activity was examined. Hydroxylation of proline residues adjacent to a serine in acceptor peptides was required for SGT activity. Genes for proteins containing conserved domains were found in various plant genomes, including A. thaliana and Nicotiana tabacum. The AtSGT1 and NtSGT1 proteins also showed SGT activity when expressed in yeast. In addition, knock-out lines of AtSGT1 and knockdown lines of NtSGT1 showed no or reduced SGT activity. The SGT1 sequence, which contains a conserved DXD motif and a C-terminal membrane spanning region, is the first example of a glycosyltransferase with type I membrane protein topology, and it showed no homology with known glycosyltransferases, indicating that SGT1 belongs to a novel glycosyltransferase gene family existing only in the plant kingdom."
https://openalex.org/W2089879126,"Cerebral ischemic preconditioning (IPC) protects brain against ischemic injury. Activation of Toll-like receptor 3 (TLR3) signaling can induce neuroprotective mediators, but whether astrocytic TLR3 signaling is involved in IPC-induced ischemic tolerance is not known.IPC was modeled in mice with three brief episodes of bilateral carotid occlusion. In vitro, IPC was modeled in astrocytes by 1-h oxygen-glucose deprivation (OGD). Injury and components of the TLR3 signaling pathway were measured after a subsequent protracted ischemic event. A neutralizing antibody against TLR3 was used to evaluate the role of TLR3 signaling in ischemic tolerance.IPC in vivo reduced brain damage from permanent middle cerebral artery occlusion in mice and increased expression of TLR3 in cortical astrocytes. IPC also reduced damage in isolated astrocytes after 12-h OGD. In astrocytes, IPC or 12-h OGD alone increased TLR3 expression, and 12-h OGD alone increased expression of phosphorylated NFκB (pNFκB). However, IPC or 12-h OGD alone did not alter the expression of Toll/interleukin receptor domain-containing adaptor-inducing IFNβ (TRIF) or phosphorylated interferon regulatory factor 3 (pIRF3). Exposure to IPC before OGD increased TRIF and pIRF3 expression but decreased pNFκB expression. Analysis of cytokines showed that 12-h OGD alone increased IFNβ and IL-6 secretion; 12-h OGD preceded by IPC further increased IFNβ secretion but decreased IL-6 secretion. Preconditioning with TLR3 ligand Poly I:C increased pIRF3 expression and protected astrocytes against ischemic injury; however, cells treated with a neutralizing antibody against TLR3 lacked the IPC- and Poly I:C-induced ischemic protection and augmentation of IFNβ.The results suggest that IPC-induced ischemic tolerance is mediated by astrocytic TLR3 signaling. This reprogramming of TLR3 signaling by IPC in astrocytes may play an important role in suppression of the post-ischemic inflammatory response and thereby protect against ischemic damage. The mechanism may be via activation of the TLR3/TRIF/IRF3 signaling pathway."
https://openalex.org/W2047729770,"Our understanding of the molecular events contributing to myogenic control of diameter in cerebral resistance arteries in response to changes in intravascular pressure, a fundamental mechanism regulating blood flow to the brain, is incomplete. Myosin light chain kinase and phosphatase activities are known to be increased and decreased, respectively, to augment phosphorylation of the 20-kDa regulatory light chain subunits (LC20) of myosin II, which permits cross-bridge cycling and force development. Here, we assessed the contribution of dynamic reorganization of the actin cytoskeleton and thin filament regulation to the myogenic response and serotonin-evoked constriction of pressurized rat middle cerebral arteries. Arterial diameter and the levels of phosphorylated LC(20), calponin, caldesmon, cofilin, and HSP27, as well as G-actin content, were determined. A decline in G-actin content was observed following pressurization from 10 mm Hg to between 40 and 120 mm Hg and in three conditions in which myogenic or agonist-evoked constriction occurred in the absence of a detectable change in LC20 phosphorylation. No changes in thin filament protein phosphorylation were evident. Pressurization reduced G-actin content and elevated the levels of cofilin and HSP27 phosphorylation. Inhibitors of Rho-associated kinase and PKC prevented the decline in G-actin; reduced cofilin and HSP27 phosphoprotein content, respectively; and blocked the myogenic response. Furthermore, phosphorylation modulators of HSP27 and cofilin induced significant changes in arterial diameter and G-actin content of myogenically active arteries. Taken together, our findings suggest that dynamic reorganization of the cytoskeleton involving increased actin polymerization in response to Rho-associated kinase and PKC signaling contributes significantly to force generation in myogenic constriction of cerebral resistance arteries."
https://openalex.org/W2017301822,"This study was undertaken to investigate combined toxic and genotoxic effects of cadmium (Cd) and arsenic (As) on white clover, a pollutant sensitive plant frequently used as environmental bioindicator. Plants were exposed to soil spiked with increasing concentrations of cadmium sulfate (20, 40 and 60 mg Kg−1) or sodium arsenite (5, 10 and 20 mg Kg−1) as well as with their combinations. Metal(loid) bioavailability was assessed after soil contamination, whereas plant growth, metal(loid) concentration in plant organs and DNA damage were measured at the end of plant exposition. Results showed that individual and joint toxicity and genotoxicity were related to the concentration of Cd and As measured in plant organs, and that As concentration was the most relevant variable. Joint effects on plant growth were additive or synergistic, whereas joint genotoxic effects were additive or antagonistic. The interaction between Cd and As occurred at both soil and plant level. In soil the presence of As limited the bioavailability of Cd, whereas the presence of Cd increased the bioavailability of As. Nevertheless only As biovailability determined the amount of As absorbed by plants. The amount of Cd absorbed by plant was not linearly correlated with the fraction of bioavailable Cd in soil suggesting the involvement of additional factors, such as plant uptake mechanisms. These results reveal that the simultaneous presence in soil of Cd and As, although producing an additive or synergistic toxic effect on Trifolium repens L. growth, generates a lower DNA damage."
https://openalex.org/W2066222183,"The extrinsic subunits of membrane-bound photosystem II (PSII) maintain an essential role in optimizing the water-splitting reaction of the oxygen-evolving complex (OEC), even though they have undergone drastic change during the evolution of oxyphototrophs from symbiotic cyanobacteria to chloroplasts. Two specific extrinsic proteins, PsbP and PsbQ, bind to the lumenal surface of PSII in green plants and maintain OEC conformation and stabilize overall enzymatic function; however, their precise location has not been fully resolved. In this study, PSII-enriched membranes, isolated from spinach, were subjected to chemical cross-linking combined with release-reconstitution experiments. We observed direct interactions between PsbP and PsbE, as well as with PsbR. Intriguingly, PsbP and PsbQ were further linked to the CP26 and CP43 light-harvesting proteins. In addition, two cross-linked sites, between PsbP and PsbR, and that of PsbP and CP26, were identified by tandem mass spectrometry. These data were used to estimate the binding topology and location of PsbP, and the putative positioning of PsbQ and PsbR on the lumenal surface of the PSII. Our model gives new insights into the organization of PSII extrinsic subunits in higher plants and their function in stabilizing the OEC of the PSII supercomplex."
https://openalex.org/W1975308821,"Background A Food and Drug Administration (FDA) safety communication in August 2011 warned that citalopram was associated with a dose dependent risk of QT prolongation and recommended dose restriction in patients over the age of 60 but did not provide data for this age group. Methods CitAD was a randomized, double-masked, placebo-controlled, multicenter clinical trial for agitation in Alzheimer's disease (AD). Participants were assigned to citalopram (target dose of 30 mg/day) or placebo in a 1∶1 ratio. 186 people, 181 of whom were over the age of 60, having probable AD with clinically significant agitation were recruited from September 2009 to January 2013. After the FDA safety communication about citalopram, ECG was added to the required study procedures before enrollment and repeated at week 3 to monitor change in QTc interval. Forty-eight participants were enrolled after enhanced monitoring began. Results Citalopram treatment was associated with a larger increase in QTc interval than placebo (difference in week 3 QTc adjusting for baseline QTc: 18.1 ms [95% CI: 6.1, 30.1]; p = 0.004). More participants in the citalopram group had an increase ≥30 ms from baseline to week 3 (7 in citalopram versus 1 in placebo; Fisher's exact p = 0.046), but only slightly more in the citalopram group met a gender-specific threshold for prolonged QTc (450 ms for males; 470 ms for females) at any point during follow-up (3 in citalopram versus 1 in placebo, Fisher's exact p = 0.611). One of the citalopram participants who developed prolonged QTc also displayed ventricular bigeminy. No participants in either group had a cardiovascular-related death. Conclusion Citalopram at 30 mg/day was associated with improvement in agitation in patients with AD but was also associated with QT prolongation. Trial Registration ClinicalTrials.gov NCT00898807"
https://openalex.org/W1965247339,"The relationship between dietary vitamin A and all-trans-retinoic acid levels in serum and tissues had not been quantified. We determined the impact of dietary vitamin A on retinoid levels in serum, liver, kidney, testis, and epididymal white adipose of five mouse strains: AKR/J; BALB/cByJ; C3H/HeJ; C57BL/6J; 129S1/SvImJ. Retinoids were quantified in mice fed copious vitamin A (lab chow, ≥20 IU/g) followed by one month feeding a vitamin A-sufficient diet (4 IU/g), or after three generations of feeding a vitamin A-sufficient diet. Retinol and retinyl esters were measured by high-performance liquid chromatography with ultraviolet absorbance detection. All-trans-retinoic acid was quantified by liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry. The amounts of dietary vitamin A had long-term strain-specific effects on tissue retinyl ester, retinol and all-trans-retinoic acid concentrations. Three generations of feeding a vitamin A-sufficient diet decreased all-trans-retinoic acid in most tissues of most strains, in some cases more than 60%, compared to a diet with copious vitamin A. With both diets, all-trans-retinoic acid concentrations maintained an order of liver ≈ testis > kidney > white adipose tissue ≈ serum. Neither retinol nor all-trans-retinoic acid in serum reflected all-trans-retinoic acid concentrations in tissues. Strain and tissue-specific differences in retinol and all-trans-retinoic acid altered by different amounts of dietary vitamin A could have profound effects on retinoid action. This would be the case especially with the increased all-trans-retinoic acid values associated with the amounts of vitamin A and its precursors (carotenoids) in chow diets."
https://openalex.org/W1990271819,"Ketamine, an N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptor antagonist, is used as a general pediatric anesthetic and anti-depressive drug. Recent studies suggest that ketamine enhances neuronal apoptosis in developing rats. The goal of this study is to explore whether ketamine could result in learning and memory impairment and neurodegeneration in adolescent rats, and if so, whether the effects of ketamine are associated with miR-214 and PTEN expression. Fifty-day-old SD rats were randomly divided into three groups receiving ketamine at 30, or 80 mg/kg, i.p. or saline for seven consecutive days. Twenty-four hours after the last treatment, learning and memory function were tested by the Morris water maze. The rats were then decapitated, and the brains were isolated for detection of neuronal apoptosis and protein PTEN expression by TUNEL and immunohistochemistry respectively. Expression levels of the miR-214 and PTEN in the hippocampus were measured by qRT-PCR and western blot analysis respectively. Ketamine administered to the adolescent rats at a dose of 80 mg/kg rather than the lower dose of 30 mg/kg caused learning and memory impairment, increased the number of apoptotic cells in the hippocampal CA1 region, cerebral cortex and subcortical region, decreased the miR-214 levels and increased PTEN protein expression in hippocampus. The results suggest that ketamine at a dose of 80 mg/kg in the adolescent rats is able to induce the learning and memory impairment and neurodegeneration, in which the down-regulation of miR-214 and high expression of PTEN protein may be involved."
https://openalex.org/W2057242319,"The objective of this research was to establish a chloroplast transformation technique for Platymonas (Tetraselmis) subcordiformis. Employing the gfp gene as a reporter and the bar gene as a selectable marker, transformation vectors of P. subcordiformis chloroplast were constructed with endogenous fragments rrn16S-trnI (left) and trnA-rrn23S (right) as a recombination site of the chloroplast genome. The plasmids were transferred into P. subcordiformis via particle bombardment. Confocal laser scanning microscopy indicated that the green fluorescence protein was localized in the chloroplast of P. subcordiformis, confirming the activity of the Chlamydomonas reinhardtii promoter. Cells transformed with the bar gene were selected using the herbicide Basta. Resistant colonies were analyzed by PCR and Southern blotting, and the results indicated that the bar gene was successfully integrated into the chloroplast genome via homologous recombination. The technique will improve genetic engineering of this alga."
https://openalex.org/W2004933891,"Humans hold unrealistically optimistic predictions of what their future holds. These predictions are generated and maintained as people update their beliefs more readily when receiving information that calls for adjustment in an optimistic direction relative to information that calls for adjustment in a pessimistic direction. Thus far this update bias has been shown when people make estimations regarding the self. Here, we examine whether asymmetric belief updating also exists when making estimations regarding population base rates. We reveal that while participants update beliefs regarding risk in the population in an asymmetric manner, such valence-dependent updating of base rates can be accounted for by priors. In contrast, we show that optimistic updating regarding the self is a robust phenomenon, which holds even under different empirical definitions of desirable information."
https://openalex.org/W2004650888,"Keratoconjunctivitis sicca (KCS), or dry eye, is a significant medical problem in both humans and dogs. Treating KCS often requires the daily application of more than one type of eye drop in order to both stimulate tear prodcution and provide a tear supplement to increase hydration and lubrication. A previous study demonstrated the potential for a crosslinked hyaluronic acid-based hydrogel (xCMHA-S) to reduce the clinical signs associated with KCS in dogs while using a reduced dosing regimen of only twice-daily administration. The present study extended those results by comparing the use of the xCMHA-S to a standard HA-containing tear supplement in a masked, randomized clinical study in dogs with a clinical diagnosis of KCS. The xCMHA-S was found to significantly improve ocular surface health (conjunctival hyperaemia, ocular irritation, and ocular discharge) to a greater degree than the alternative tear supplement (P = 0.0003). Further, owners reported the xCMHA-S treatment as being more highly effective than the alternative tear supplement (P = 0.0024). These results further demonstrate the efficacy of the xCMHA-S in reducing the clinical signs associated with KCS, thereby improving patient health and owner happiness."
https://openalex.org/W2054289136,"Using published dairy cattle liver transcriptomics dataset along with novel blood biomarkers of liver function, metabolism, and inflammation we have attempted an integrative systems biology approach applying the classical functional enrichment analysis using DAVID, a newly-developed Dynamic Impact Approach (DIA), and an upstream gene network analysis using Ingenuity Pathway Analysis (IPA). Transcriptome data was generated from experiments evaluating the impact of prepartal plane of energy intake [overfed (OF) or restricted (RE)] on liver of dairy cows during the peripartal period. Blood biomarkers uncovered that RE vs. OF led to greater prepartal liver distress accompanied by a low-grade inflammation and larger proteolysis (i.e., higher haptoglobin, bilirubin, and creatinine). Post-partum the greater bilirubinaemia and lipid accumulation in OF vs. RE indicated a large degree of liver distress. The re-analysis of microarray data revealed that expression of >4,000 genes was affected by diet × time. The bioinformatics analysis indicated that RE vs. OF cows had a liver with a greater lipid and amino acid catabolic capacity both pre- and post-partum while OF vs. RE cows had a greater activation of pathways/functions related to triglyceride synthesis. Furthermore, RE vs. OF cows had a larger (or higher capacity to cope with) ER stress likely associated with greater protein synthesis/processing, and a higher activation of inflammatory-related functions. Liver in OF vs. RE cows had a larger cell proliferation and cell-to-cell communication likely as a response to the greater lipid accumulation. Analysis of upstream regulators indicated a pivotal role of several lipid-related transcription factors (e.g., PPARs, SREBPs, and NFE2L2) in priming the liver of RE cows to better face the early postpartal metabolic and inflammatory challenges. An all-encompassing dynamic model was proposed based on the findings."
https://openalex.org/W2135096092,"Seroprevalence data of human herpesviruses (HHVs) are limited for sub-Saharan Africa. These are important to provide an indication of potential burden of HHV-related disease, in particular in human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-infected individuals who are known to be at increased risk of these conditions in the Western world. In this cross-sectional study among 405 HIV-infected and antiretroviral therapy naïve individuals in rural South Africa the seroprevalence of HHVs was: herpes simplex virus type 1 (HSV-1) (98%), herpes simplex virus type 2 (HSV-2) (87%), varicella zoster virus (VZV) (89%), and 100% for both Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) and cytomegalovirus (CMV). Independent factors associated with VZV seropositivity were low educational status and having children. Lack of in-house access to drinking water was independently associated with positive HSV-1 serostatus, whereas Shangaan ethnicity was associated with HSV-2 seropositivity. Increasing age was associated with higher IgG titres to both EBV and CMV, whereas CD4 cell count was negatively associated with EBV and CMV IgG titres. Moreover, IgG titres of HSV-1 and 2, VZV and CMV, and CMV and EBV were positively correlated. The high HHV seroprevalence emphasises the importance of awareness of these viral infections in HIV-infected individuals in South Africa."
https://openalex.org/W2018218953,"TCF7L2 is the susceptibility gene for Type 2 diabetes (T2D) with the largest effect on disease risk that has been discovered to date. However, the mechanisms by which TCF7L2 contributes to the disease remain largely elusive. In addition, epigenetic mechanisms, such as changes in DNA methylation patterns, might have a role in the pathophysiology of T2D. This study aimed to investigate the differences in terms of DNA methylation profile of TCF7L2 promoter gene between type 2 diabetic patients and age- and Body Mass Index (BMI)- matched controls. We included 93 type 2 diabetic patients that were recently diagnosed for T2D and exclusively on diet (without any pharmacological treatment). DNA was extracted from whole blood and DNA methylation was assessed using the Sequenom EpiTYPER system. Type 2 diabetic patients were more insulin resistant than their matched controls (mean HOMA IR 2.6 vs 1.8 in controls, P<0.001) and had a poorer beta-cell function (mean HOMA B 75.7 vs. 113.6 in controls, P<0.001). Results showed that 59% of the CpGs analyzed in TCF7L2 promoter had significant differences between type 2 diabetic patients and matched controls. In addition, fasting glucose, HOMA-B, HOMA-IR, total cholesterol and LDL-cholesterol correlated with methylation in specific CpG sites of TCF7L2 promoter. After adjustment by age, BMI, gender, physical inactivity, waist circumference, smoking status and diabetes status uniquely fasting glucose, total cholesterol and LDL-cholesterol remained significant. Taken together, newly diagnosed, drug-naïve type 2 diabetic patients display specific epigenetic changes at the TCF7L2 promoter as compared to age- and BMI-matched controls. Methylation in TCF7L2 promoter is further correlated with fasting glucose in peripheral blood DNA, which sheds new light on the role of epigenetic regulation of TCF7L2 in T2D."
https://openalex.org/W2019939916,"The Pannexin-1 (Panx1) channel is known to become activated under a variety of physiological conditions resulting in the release of medium-sized molecules such as ATP and amino acids from the cell. The detailed molecular mechanism of activation of the channel resulting in the opening of the Pannexin pore is poorly understood. The best-studied gating mechanism is caspase-3/7-mediated cleavage and truncation of the c-terminus. In the absence of caspase-cleavage, the c-terminal peptide maintains the channel in the closed state, possibly by directly plugging the pore from the intracellular side. We sought to understand in detail the part of the c-terminus necessary for this interaction by alanine-scanning and truncation mutagenesis of the c-terminal gating peptide. These experiments demonstrate that no single amino acid side-chain is necessary for this interaction. In fact, replacing blocks of 10–12 amino acids in different parts of the c-terminal peptide with alanines fails to disrupt the ability of the c-terminus to keep the channel closed. Surprisingly, even replacing the entire c-terminal gating peptide with a scrambled peptide of the same length maintains the interaction in some cases. Further analysis revealed that the interaction surface, while delocalized, is located within the amino-terminal two-thirds of the c-terminal peptide. Such a delocalized and potentially low-affinity interaction surface is allowed due to the high effective concentration of the c-terminal peptide near the inner vestibule of the pore and likely explains why this region is poorly conserved between species. This type of weak interaction with a tethered gating peptide may be required to maintain high-sensitivity to caspase-dependent activation."
https://openalex.org/W1984861157,"Lafora disease is a progressive myoclonus epilepsy caused by mutations in the EPM2A or EPM2B genes that encode a glycogen phosphatase, laforin, and an E3 ubiquitin ligase, malin, respectively. Lafora disease is characterized by accumulation of insoluble, poorly branched, hyperphosphorylated glycogen in brain, muscle, heart, and liver. The laforinmalin complex has been proposed to play a role in the regulation of glycogen metabolism and protein quality control. We evaluated three arms of the protein degradation/ quality control process (the autophago-lysosomal pathway, the ubiquitin-proteasomal pathway, and the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress response) in mouse embryonic fibroblasts from Epm2a(-/-), Epm2b(-/-), and Epm2a(-/-) Epm2b(-/-) mice. The levels of LC3-II, a marker of autophagy, were decreased in all knock-out cells as compared with wild type even though they still showed a slight response to starvation and rapamycin. Furthermore, ribosomal protein S6 kinase and S6 phosphorylation were increased. Under basal conditions there was no effect on the levels of ubiquitinated proteins in the knock-out cells, but ubiquitinated protein degradation was decreased during starvation or stress. Lack of malin (Epm2b(-/-) and Epm2a(-/-) Epm2b(-/-) cells) but not laforin (Epm2a(-/-) cells) decreased LAMP1, a lysosomal marker. CHOP expression was similar in wild type and knock-out cells under basal conditions or with ER stress-inducing agents. In conclusion, both laforin and malin knock-out cells display mTOR-dependent autophagy defects and reduced proteasomal activity but no defects in the ER stress response. We speculate that these defects may be secondary to glycogen overaccumulation. This study also suggests a malin function independent of laforin, possibly in lysosomal biogenesis and/or lysosomal glycogen disposal."
https://openalex.org/W2024885527,"Background Shiga toxin-producing E. coli (STEC) are a group of common and potentially deadly intestinal pathogens expressing Shiga toxin (Stx) as a primary virulence factor. Of the two types of Stx, Stx2 is responsible for more severe symptoms during infection, while Stx1 is almost identical to the Shiga toxin from Shigella dysenteriae, a ubiquitous pathogen in developing countries. Although antibodies against Stx1 have been reported, few have reached the affinity needed for assembling highly sensitive immunoassays. Sensitive and affordable immunoassays for Stx1 and Stx2 could help improve detection of STEC in livestock, food, the environment, and in clinical samples resulting in improved food safety and human health. Method and Findings Three new monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) against the B subunit of Stx1 were generated using recombinant toxoid Stx1E167Q and hybridoma technology. These new mAbs recognize all subtypes of Stx1, but do not cross-react with any subtype of Stx2. In addition, they exhibited the ability to neutralize Stx1 toxicity in Vero cell assays. An optimized sandwich ELISA using of a pair of these mAbs had a limit of detection of 8.7 pg/mL, which is superior to any existing assay of this kind. Using one of these Stx1 mAbs in concert with Stx2 mAbs, the presence of hybrid Stx1/Stx2 toxin in the culture media of STEC strains that express both Stx1 and Stx2 was demonstrated. Conclusions These new mAbs provide a mix of availability, utility, versatility, and most importantly, increased sensitivity for detection of Stx1. There are numerous potential applications for these mAbs, including low-cost detection assays and therapeutic use. Analysis of hybrid Stx1/2 could provide new insights on the structure, activity, and cellular targets of Shiga toxins."
https://openalex.org/W1987055005,"Clonality is a common characteristic of successful invasive species, but general principles underpinning the success of clonal invaders are not established. A number of mechanisms could contribute to invasion success including clones with broad tolerances and preferences, specialist clones and adaptation in situ. The majority of studies to date have been of plants and some invertebrate parthenogens, particularly aphids, and have not necessarily caught invasion at very early stages. Here we describe the early stages of an invasion by a Northern Hemisphere Hymenopteran model in three different land masses in the Southern Hemisphere. Nematus oligospilus Förster (Hymenoptera: Tenthredinidae), a sawfly feeding on willows (Salix spp.), was recently introduced to the Southern Hemisphere where it has become invasive and is strictly parthenogenetic. In this study, the number of N. oligospilus clones, their distribution in the landscape and on different willow hosts in South Africa, New Zealand and Australia were assessed using 25 microsatellite markers. Evidence is presented for the presence of two very common and widespread multilocus genotypes (MLGs) or 'superclones' dominating in the three countries. Rarer MLGs were closely related to the most widespread superclone; it is plausible that all N. oligospilus individuals were derived from a single clone. A few initial introductions to Australia and New Zealand seemed to have occurred. Our results point towards a separate introduction in Western Australia, potentially from South Africa. Rarer clones that were dominant locally putatively arose in situ, and might be locally favoured, or simply have not yet had time to spread. Data presented represent rare baseline data early in the invasion process for insights into the mechanisms that underlie the success of a global invader, and develop Nematus oligospilus as a valuable model to understand invasion genetics of clonal pests."

In clear cell RCC, VHL loss generates pseudohypoxia that exacerbates HGF-driven invasion through β-catenin deregulation. Hypoxia also enhances HGF-driven invasiveness by papillary RCC cells, but in the absence of VHL, loss signaling integration involves three parallel routes: 1) hypoxia-induced reactive oxygen species production and decreased DUSP2 expression, leading to enhanced mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) cascade activation; 2) reactive oxygen species-induced diacylglycerol production by phospholipase Cγ, leading to protein kinase C activation and increased protein phosphatase-2A activity, thereby suppressing HGF-induced Akt activation; and 3) a profound shift from HGF-enhanced, proliferation-oriented metabolism to autophagy-dependent invasion and suppression of proliferation. This tripartite signaling integration was not unique to RCC or HGF; in RCC cells, invasive synergy induced by the combination of hypoxia and epidermal growth factor occurred through the same mechanism, and in estrogen receptor-positive breast cancer cells, this mechanism was suppressed in the absence of estrogen. These results define the molecular basis of growth factor and hypoxia invasive synergy in VHL-competent papillary RCC cells, illustrate the plasticity of invasive and proliferative tumor cell states, and provide signaling profiles by which they may be predicted.

https://openalex.org/W1977348397,"Cellular accumulation of cyclin D1, a key regulator of cell proliferation and tumorigenesis, is subject to tight control. Our previous studies have identified PKCα as a negative regulator of cyclin D1 in the intestinal epithelium. However, treatment of non-transformed IEC-18 ileal crypt cells with PKC agonists has a biphasic effect on cyclin D1 expression. Initial PKCα-mediated down-regulation is followed by recovery and subsequent accumulation of the cyclin to levels markedly higher than those seen in untreated cells. Using protein overexpression strategies, siRNA, and pharmacological inhibitors, we now demonstrate that the recovery and hyperinduction of cyclin D1 reflect the combined effects of (a) loss of negative signals from PKCα due to agonist-induced PKCα down-regulation and (b) positive effects of PKCϵ. PKCϵ-mediated up-regulation of cyclin D1 requires sustained ERK stimulation and transcriptional activation of the proximal cyclin D1 (CCDN1) promoter, without apparent involvement of changes in protein stability or translation. PKCϵ also up-regulates cyclin D1 expression in colon cancer cells, through mechanisms that parallel those in IEC-18 cells. Although induction of cyclin D1 by PKCϵ is dependent on non-canonical NF-κB activation, the NF-κB site in the proximal promoter is not required. Instead, cyclin D1 promoter activity is regulated by a novel interaction between NF-κB and factors that associate with the cyclic AMP-response element adjacent to the NF-κB site. The differential effects of PKCα and PKCϵ on cyclin D1 accumulation are likely to contribute to the opposing tumor-suppressive and tumor-promoting activities of these PKC family members in the intestinal epithelium."
https://openalex.org/W2037518984,"Preadipocytes contribute to the inflammatory responses within adipose tissue. Whilst fatty acids are known to elicit an inflammatory response within adipose tissue, the relative contribution of preadipocytes and mature adipocytes to this is yet to be determined. We aimed to examine the actions of common dietary fatty acids on the acute inflammatory and adipokine response in 3T3-L1 preadipocytes and differentiated mature adipocytes. Gene expression levels of key adipokines in 3T3-L1 preadipocytes and adipocytes were determined following incubation with palmitic acid, myristic acid or oleic acid and positive inflammatory control, lipopolysaccharide for 2 and 4 h. Inflammatory kinase signalling was assessed by analysis of nuclear factor-κB, p38-mitogen-activated protein kinase and c-jun amino-terminal kinase phosphorylation. Under basal conditions, intracellular monocyte chemoattractant protein-1 and interleukin-6 gene expression levels were increased in preadipocytes, whereas mature adipocytes expressed increased gene expression levels of leptin and adiponectin. Fatty acid exposure at 2 and 4 h increased both monocyte chemoattractant protein-1 and interleukin-6 gene expression levels in preadipocytes to greater levels than in mature adipocytes. There was an accompanying increase of inhibitor of κB-α degradation and nuclear factor-κB (p65) (Ser536) phosphorylation with fatty acid exposure in the preadipocytes only. The current study points to preadipocytes rather than the adipocytes as the contributors to both immune cell recruitment and inflammatory adipokine secretion with acute increases in fatty acids."
https://openalex.org/W2162950659,"Paranoia is a dimension of clinical and subclinical experiences in which others are believed to have harmful intentions. Mild paranoid concerns are relatively common in the general population, and more clinically severe paranoia shares features with social anxiety and is a key characteristic of schizotypy. Given that subclinical manifestations of schizotypy and paranoia may predict the occurrence of more severe symptoms, disentangling the associations of these related constructs may advance our understanding of their etiology; however no known studies to date have comprehensively evaluated how paranoia relates to social anxiety and schizotypy. The current research sought to examine the association of paranoia, assessed across a broad continuum of severity, with 1) the positive and negative schizotypy dimensions and 2) social anxiety. Specifically, the study tested a series of six competing, a priori models using confirmatory factor analysis in a sample of 862 young adults. As hypothesized, the data supported a four-factor model including positive schizotypy, negative schizotypy, social anxiety, and paranoia factors, suggesting that these are distinct constructs with differing patterns of interrelationships. Paranoia had a strong association with positive schizotypy, a moderate association with social anxiety, and a minimal association with negative schizotypy. The results are consistent with paranoia being part of a multidimensional model of schizotypy and schizophrenia. Prior studies treating schizotypy and schizophrenia as homogenous constructs often produce equivocal or non-replicable results because these dimensions are associated with distinct etiologies, presentations, and treatment responses; thus, the present conceptualization of paranoia within a multidimensional schizotypy framework should advance our understanding of these constructs."
https://openalex.org/W2037026202,"Salvia miltiorrhiza is one of the most widely used medicinal plants. As a first step to develop a chloroplast-based genetic engineering method for the over-production of active components from S. miltiorrhiza, we have analyzed the genome, transcriptome, and base modifications of the S. miltiorrhiza chloroplast. Total genomic DNA and RNA were extracted from fresh leaves and then subjected to strand-specific RNA-Seq and Single-Molecule Real-Time (SMRT) sequencing analyses. Mapping the RNA-Seq reads to the genome assembly allowed us to determine the relative expression levels of 80 protein-coding genes. In addition, we identified 19 polycistronic transcription units and 136 putative antisense and intergenic noncoding RNA (ncRNA) genes. Comparison of the abundance of protein-coding transcripts (cRNA) with and without overlapping antisense ncRNAs (asRNA) suggest that the presence of asRNA is associated with increased cRNA abundance (p<0.05). Using the SMRT Portal software (v1.3.2), 2687 potential DNA modification sites and two potential DNA modification motifs were predicted. The two motifs include a TATA box–like motif (CPGDMM1, “TATANNNATNA”), and an unknown motif (CPGDMM2 “WNYANTGAW”). Specifically, 35 of the 97 CPGDMM1 motifs (36.1%) and 91 of the 369 CPGDMM2 motifs (24.7%) were found to be significantly modified (p<0.01). Analysis of genes downstream of the CPGDMM1 motif revealed the significantly increased abundance of ncRNA genes that are less than 400 bp away from the significantly modified CPGDMM1motif (p<0.01). Taking together, the present study revealed a complex interplay among DNA modifications, ncRNA and cRNA expression in chloroplast genome."
https://openalex.org/W2079629220,"Colonisation of novel environments means facing new ecological challenges often resulting in the evolution of striking divergence in phenotypes. However, little is known about behavioural divergence following colonisation, despite the predicted importance of the role of behavioural phenotype-environment associations in adaptive divergence. We studied the threespine stickleback (Gasterosteus aculeatus), a model system for postglacial colonisation of freshwater habitats largely differing in ecological conditions from the ones faced by the descendants of the marine ancestor. We found that common-environment reared freshwater juveniles were less social, more active and more aggressive than their marine counterparts. This behavioural divergence could represent the result of natural selection that acted on individuals following freshwater colonisation, with predation as a key selection agent. Alternatively, the behavioural profile of freshwater juveniles could represent the characteristics of individuals that preferentially invaded freshwater after the glacial retreat, drawn from the standing variation present in the marine population."
https://openalex.org/W2057438139,"FUS mutations can occur in familial amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (fALS), a neurodegenerative disease with cytoplasmic FUS inclusion bodies in motor neurons. To investigate FUS pathology, we generated transgenic zebrafish expressing GFP-tagged wild-type or fALS (R521C) human FUS. Cell cultures were made from these zebrafish and the subcellular localization of human FUS and the generation of stress granule (SG) inclusions examined in different cell types, including differentiated motor neurons. We demonstrate that mutant FUS is mislocalized from the nucleus to the cytosol to a similar extent in motor neurons and all other cell types. Both wild-type and R521C FUS localized to SGs in zebrafish cells, demonstrating an intrinsic ability of human FUS to accumulate in SGs irrespective of the presence of disease-associated mutations or specific cell type. However, elevation in relative cytosolic to nuclear FUS by the R521C mutation led to a significant increase in SG assembly and persistence within a sub population of vulnerable cells, although these cells were not selectively motor neurons."
https://openalex.org/W2014495166,"The pole-to-pole oscillation of the Min proteins in Escherichia coli results in the inhibition of aberrant polar division, thus facilitating placement of the division septum at the midcell. MinE of the Min system forms a ring-like structure that plays a critical role in triggering the oscillation cycle. However, the mechanism underlying the formation of the MinE ring remains unclear. This study demonstrates that MinE self-assembles into fibrillar structures on the supported lipid bilayer. The MinD-interacting domain of MinE shows amyloidogenic properties, providing a possible mechanism for self-assembly of MinE. Supporting the idea, mutations in residues Ile-24 and Ile-25 of the MinD-interacting domain affect fibril formation, membrane binding ability of MinE and MinD, and subcellular localization of three Min proteins. Additional mutations in residues Ile-72 and Ile-74 suggest a role of the C-terminal domain of MinE in regulating the folding propensity of the MinD-interacting domain for different molecular interactions. The study suggests a self-assembly mechanism that may underlie the ring-like structure formed by MinE-GFP observed in vivo."
https://openalex.org/W2058339321,"Introduction Spermatogenesis is a highly complex process involving several thousand genes, only a minority of which have been studied in infertile men. In a previous study, we identified a number of Copy Number Variants (CNVs) by high-resolution array-Comparative Genomic Hybridization (a-CGH) analysis of the X chromosome, including 16 patient-specific X chromosome-linked gains. Of these, five gains (DUP1A, DUP5, DUP20, DUP26 and DUP40) were selected for further analysis to evaluate their clinical significance. Materials and Methods The copy number state of the five selected loci was analyzed by quantitative-PCR on a total of 276 idiopathic infertile patients and 327 controls in a conventional case-control setting (199 subjects belonged to the previous a-CGH study). For one interesting locus (intersecting DUP1A) additional 338 subjects were analyzed. Results and Discussion All gains were confirmed as patient-specific and the difference in duplication load between patients and controls is significant (p = 1.65×10−4). Two of the CNVs are private variants, whereas 3 are found recurrently in patients and none of the controls. These CNVs include, or are in close proximity to, genes with testis-specific expression. DUP1A, mapping to the PAR1, is found at the highest frequency (1.4%) that was significantly different from controls (0%) (p = 0.047 after Bonferroni correction). Two mechanisms are proposed by which DUP1A may cause spermatogenic failure: i) by affecting the correct regulation of a gene with potential role in spermatogenesis; ii) by disturbing recombination between PAR1 regions during meiosis. This study allowed the identification of novel spermatogenesis candidate genes linked to the 5 CNVs and the discovery of the first recurrent, X-linked gain with potential clinical relevance."

This receptor disintegration process can hardly be explained through the action of a single protease (elastase), particularly as CXCR1 represents a seven-transmembrane G-protein-coupled receptor. Based on our current view, post-translational disintegration of CXCR1 involves at least two distinct molecular events: (i) proteolytic cleavage of an extracellular moiety of CXCR1 by elastase activities and (ii) disintegration of the C-terminal CXCR1 receptor part through a so-far unidentified intracellular machinery. Because the C-terminal moiety of CXCR1 is physically not accessible to exogenous proteases, we hypothesized that elastase, besides its direct proteolytic effects, activates an intracellular downstream network of proteases, which collaborate in the disintegration of the C-terminal CXCR1 moiety. cystic fibrosis co-immunoprecipitation matrix metalloprotease disintegrin and metalloprotease bioluminescence resonance energy transfer Hanks' balanced salt solution 2-[bis(2-hydroxyethyl)amino]-2-(hydroxymethyl)propane-1,3-diol nicastrin basigin Toll-like receptor.

Next, 9 ml of the Percoll solution with density 1.03 g/ml were underlayered with 9 ml of the supernatant to create a flotation medium for separation of plasma membranes/cytosol and secretory vesicles. Furthermore, this was underlayered with a two-layer Percoll gradient (9 ml with a density of 1.09 g/ml and with 9 ml of a density of 1.12 g/ml) to separate azurophil, specific, and gelatinase granules. pH was adjusted to 7.0 by HCl. The four-layer gradient was centrifuged 20 000 × g for 40 min, resulting in 5 major bands: the α-band enriched in primary/azurophil granules (marker: myeloperoxidase), the β1-band enriched in secondary/specific granules (marker: neutrophil gelatinase-associated lipocalin), the β2-band enriched in tertiary/gelatinase granules (marker: gelatinase/MMP9), a γ1-band enriched in secretory vesicles (marker: albumin), and the γ2 band-containing plasma membranes (marker: human leukocyte antigen). Samples were subjected to ELISA analysis or to SDS-PAGE and Western blot analysis. Myeloperoxidase, neutrophil gelatinase-associated lipocalin, MMP-9, HSA, and human leukocyte antigen were quantified in each fraction by ELISA and used as marker proteins for azurophil granule, specific granules, gelatinase granules, secretory vesicles, and plasma membrane, respectively. Neutrophil fractions were separated on NuPAGE 4–12% BOLT Bis-Tris Plus gels (Invitrogen), and immunoblotting was performed by standard procedures using XCell II blotting chambers (Invitrogen). After blocking, a primary antibody against PAR-2 (Abcam, ab128628) was incubated overnight. Blots were processed by using alkaline phosphatase-conjugated secondary antibodies (DAKO) and ECL solution (GE Healthcare). Semiquantitative analysis was performed with the Quantity One software system (Bio-Rad). Flow cytometric data were obtained on a FACSCalibur flow cytometer and analyzed with CellQuest software (BD Biosciences). Staining was performed following standard procedures. The mAbs used were anti-presenilin-1 and anti-PAR-2. Appropriate isotype controls were used for all applied detection antibodies. For intracellular cytokine, detection cells were preincubated with brefeldin A at 10 μg/ml. After surface staining, cells were fixed with 2% paraformaldehyde and subsequently permeabilized with saponin 0.1% and then stained for intracellular proteins. For visualization of presenilin-1, the samples were incubated with rabbit anti-human presenilin-1 (Abcam, ab15456 monoclonal) or anti-human CXCR1 antibodies (Santa Cruz, polyclonal). The primary antibodies were detected in confocal laser-scanning microscope by means of a secondary anti-rabbit Alexa Fluor 555 antibody (Invitrogen). DNA was stained with DAPI (Sigma), and concanavalin A Alexa 488 conjugate (Invitrogen) was used for detecting glycoconjugates in the cytoplasm. The specimens were analyzed with a confocal laser-scanning microscope (Olympus IX 51). Interactions between CXCR1 and candidate proteins of the α- and γ-secretase or PAR-2 were tested using BRET where Renilla luciferase (Rluc) serves as donor and yellow fluorescent protein (YFP) serves as the acceptor of energy transfer, occurring when proteins physically interact (14Pfleger K.D. Eidne K.A. Illuminating insights into protein-protein interactions using bioluminescence resonance energy transfer (BRET).Nat. Methods. 2006; 3: 165-174Crossref PubMed Scopus (434) Google Scholar). Plasmids were constructed carrying the coding sequence of candidate proteins fused to Rluc or YFP protein, respectively. BRET experiments were performed as described previously (15Gersting S.W. Lotz-Havla A.S. Muntau A.C. Bioluminescence resonance energy transfer: an emerging tool for the detection of protein-protein interaction in living cells.Methods Mol. Biol. 2012; 815: 253-263Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar). For each interaction HEK293 cells were co-transfected with a total of 0.8 μg of DNA at an acceptor-to-donor ratio of 3:1. For BRET titration experiments that where performed to distinguish a true positive interaction and bystander BRET resulting from random collision, HEK293 cells were co-transfected at increasing acceptor-to-donor ratios with a total of 2 μg of DNA. For BRET titration experiment that were performed to distinguish direct and non-direct interactions, cells were co-transfected at increasing DNA amounts at a constant acceptor-to-donor ratio of 1. All experiments where performed in duplicate and at least two independent experiments. After 24 h, coelenterazine (30 μm) was added to the living cells, and light emission was collected in a 96-well microplate luminometer LUMIstar OPTIMA (BMG Labtech) for 10 s at 475 nm (Rluc signal) and 535 nm (BRET signal). BRET ratio was calculated based on R = IA/ID − cf, where R is the BRET ratio, IA is the intensity of light emission at 535 nm, ID is the intensity of light emission at 475 nm, and cf is a correction factor = (BRETcontrol/Rluccontrol) with the negative control being the co-transfection of donor fusion proteins with YFP in the absence of the protein of interest. A positive interaction was assumed if an investigated protein pair results in a BRET ratio above the method-specific threshold of 0.094. The expression of a YFP-Rluc fusion protein as a control was included in every individual experiment. For evaluation of titration experiments, an bioinformatics algorithm was applied (16James J.R. Oliveira M.I. Carmo A.M. Iaboni A. Davis S.J. A rigorous experimental framework for detecting protein oligomerization using bioluminescence resonance energy transfer.Nat. Methods. 2006; 3: 1001-1006Crossref PubMed Scopus (267) Google Scholar). First, titration experiments performed at increasing acceptor-to-donor ratios, and constant total DNA amounts were analyzed using the Akaike's method (GraphPad Prism) to distinguish non-linear regression (true positive interaction) and linear regression (false positive interaction). For the non-linear regression model, parameters were subsequently calculated by Y = BRETmax(X/BRET50 + X), where BRETmax is the maximal BRET ratio, and BRET50 is the acceptor-to-donor ratio required to reach half-maximal BRET. An interaction was assumed to be true positive if the preferred model was non-linear, with an R2 > 0.8. Second, linear regression analysis was applied for experiments performed at a constant acceptor-to-donor ratio but increasing DNA amounts. An interaction was assumed to be direct at parameters of 1/slope <10 and y intercepts when X = 0.0 at >0.05. For BRET experiments probing the influence of elastase on protein interactions, HEK293 co-transfected with candidate proteins at increasing acceptor-to-donor ratios were incubated with 5 μg/ml elastase for 60 min before BRET measurements. Co-IP in isolated human neutrophils was performed using the Dynabead technology (Invitrogen) as described previously (17Hanafusa H. Ishikawa K. Kedashiro S. Saigo T. Iemura S. Natsume T. Komada M. Shibuya H. Nara A. Matsumoto K. Leucine-rich repeat kinase LRRK1 regulates endosomal trafficking of the EGF receptor.Nat. Commun. 2011; 2: 158Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). The presenilin-1 (Abcam, ab15456 monoclonal) was used. Moreover, co-IP to confirm the interaction of CXCR1 and APH-1 was performed in COS-7 cells co-transfected with candidate proteins carrying C-terminal V5 tag or N-terminal FLAG tag. Lysates of COS-7 cells were incubated with mouse anti-FLAG antibody (1:1000 dilution; Agilent Technologies) and μMac beads (1:20 dilution; Miltenyi Biotec). Pre-equilibrated μMac columns were loaded with the lysate followed by washing and preincubated with LDS sample buffer (95 °C) for 5 min. Bound material was resuspended in 45 μl of LDS buffer, and proteins were separated by SDS-PAGE (4–12% Novex NuPAGE Bis-Tris gel system, Invitrogen) at a constant voltage of 200 V for 90 min. Proteins were blotted onto nitrocellulose membranes subsequent to SDS-PAGE. Blocked membranes were incubated for 1 h with the primary antibody, mouse anti-V5 (1:5,000 dilution; Invitrogen), or mouse anti-FLAG antibody (1:1,000 dilution; Agilent Technologies) as control and 1 h with the secondary, goat anti-mouse IgG HRP conjugated antibody (1:10,000 dilution; Santa Cruz Biotechnology). Blots were visualized with SuperSignal West Femto Substrate (Thermo Scientific), and chemiluminescence was monitored with a DIANA III imaging system. Background-corrected images were quantified by use of Aida Image Analyzer software v.4.04 (Raytest). Statistical significance of differences was determined by paired two-tailed Student's t test. In all tests differences were considered significant at p < 0.05. To dissect intracellular pathways involved in elastase-mediated cleavage of CXCR1, we applied an unbiased small molecule screen covering different classes of (i) proteases, including MMPs, ADAM/α-secretases, and γ-secretases, (ii) kinases, and (iii) putative elastase receptors and pretreated isolated neutrophils with these compounds/blocking antibodies before elastase stimulation (see Table 1 for details). Pretreatment of isolated neutrophils with single protease inhibitors in non-toxic but inhibitory concentrations (based on their IC50 values) had no significant effect on elastase-triggered CXCR1 cleavage (Fig. 1A). However, when our screen was expanded to combined inhibition of ADAM17 and γ-secretase activity, elastase-mediated CXCR1 cleavage was largely prevented, whereas inhibition of ADAM17 and γ-secretase alone had no significant effect. This initial finding was corroborated by immunoblotting of the extracellular C-terminal CXCR1 moiety (Fig. 1B) and confocal laser scanning microscopy (Fig. 1C) and was pharmacologically confirmed by a second class of γ-secretase inhibitors that showed a similar result (Fig. 1A). Because α- and γ-secretases are mainly active intracellularly, we hypothesized that exogenous elastase activates intracellular secretases through activation of a surface receptor on neutrophils. Because TLR4 and PAR-2 have been previously involved in elastase-mediated cell activation, we used TLR4 and PAR-2 blocking antibodies in these assays. These experiments showed that blocking PAR-2, but not blocking TLR4 (Fig. 1A), had a significant effect on elastase-mediated CXCR1 loss comparable to the effect observed by combined α- and γ-secretase inhibition. When viewed in combination, these results demonstrate that combined α- and γ-secretase activity and PAR-2 are involved in elastase-mediated disintegration of CXCR1 expression on human neutrophils. Next, we asked whether secretase components are expressed by human neutrophils and colocalize with CXCR1 at the single cell level. Confocal microscopy, flow cytometry, and immunoblotting (Fig. 2) confirmed the presence of the presenilin-1, the key component of γ-secretase harboring protease activity (18Wolfe M.S. Haass C. The role of presenilins in γ-secretase activity.J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 5413-5416Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar), in isolated primary human neutrophils. Presenilin-1 was mainly localized intracellularly and at perimembranous regions and partially co-localized with CXCR1 in neutrophils (Fig. 2, A and B). BRET further demonstrated physical interaction of CXCR1 with other core components of the γ-secretase complex, particularly APH-1. BRET ratios determined for interaction of CXCR1 with presenilin-1 and with PEN-2 did not exceed a method specific threshold of 0.094, and the BRET ratio for nicastrin was even lower (Fig. 2C). However, a BRET ratio above the threshold was observed for basigin, recently shown to act as a key regulator of γ-secretase function (19Zhou S. Zhou H. Walian P.J. Jap B.K. CD147 is a regulatory subunit of the γ-secretase complex in Alzheimer's disease amyloid β-peptide production.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2005; 102: 7499-7504Crossref PubMed Scopus (175) Google Scholar). Moreover, the α-secretase ADAM10 and PAR-2 interacted with CXCR1. The interaction of CXCR1 with CXCR2 served as a positive control, and the interaction with the peroxisomal protein PEX14 as a negative control. Next we performed fine-mapping of the CXCR1/γ-secretase network analyzing APH-1, which displayed the highest BRET ratio, as well as presenilin-1 as the active component of the complex. BRET titration experiments revealed that CXCR1 interacted directly with APH-1, whereas the interaction with presenilin-1 was found to be indirect (Fig. 2, D and E). By contrast, CXCR2 only indirectly interacted with both APH-1 and presenilin-1 (data not shown). This finding pointed to a specific non-redundant and functional interaction of CXCR1 with the γ-secretase, whereas CXCR2 was linked to the complex indirectly by interaction with CXCR1. This is consistent with our previous observations that CXCR1 (4Hartl D. Latzin P. Hordijk P. Marcos V. Rudolph C. Woischnik M. Krauss-Etschmann S. Koller B. Reinhardt D. Roscher A.A. Roos D. Griese M. Cleavage of CXCR1 on neutrophils disables bacterial killing in cystic fibrosis lung disease.Nat. Med. 2007; 13: 1423-1430Crossref PubMed Scopus (262) Google Scholar), but not CXCR2, is processed by elastase in the airways of individuals with CF, thereby disabling the bacteria-killing capacity of neutrophils and modulating disease activity. To investigate whether the interaction of CXCR1 with APH-1 depends on a functional catalytically active γ-secretase complex, further BRET experiments were performed upon co-expression of wild-type presenilin-1 or the mutant D257A. The D257A side chain replacement allows for γ-secretase complex formation but impedes the activating endoproteolytic cleavage of presenilin-1 (Fig. 2F). No impact on the interaction of CXCR1 with APH-1 was observed (p = 0.28) in the presence of D257A, indicating that the APH-1-mediated recruitment of CXCR1 to the γ-secretase complex did not depend on secretase activity. Finally, the direct physical interaction between CXCR1 and APH-1 was confirmed by co-immunoprecipitation (Fig. 2G). To explore the functional context and to gain insight into cellular pathways of proteins involved in the identified interactions, we investigated the cellular protein network of CXCR1 and the α-/γ-secretases in more depth. Based on a database research (STRING, BioGRID, HPRD), a network of first order interactions was constructed (Fig. 2H). These studies confirmed the notion that the chemokine receptors CXCR1 and CXCR2 interact with each other through receptor cross-desensitization, cross-regulation (20Richardson R.M. Pridgen B.C. Haribabu B. Ali H. Snyderman R. Differential cross-regulation of the human chemokine receptors CXCR1 and CXCR2. Evidence for time-dependent signal generation.J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 23830-23836Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar), and heterodimerization (21Wilson S. Wilkinson G. Milligan G. The CXCR1 and CXCR2 receptors form constitutive homo- and heterodimers selectively and with equal apparent affinities.J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 28663-28674Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar) and thereby establish shared interactions with their cognate chemokine ligands (CXCL1, CXCL2, CXCL5, PPBP, CXCL8). CXCR1 and PAR-2 were further shown to be linked to the protein interaction cluster of the γ-secretase complex (APH-1, NCSTN, PEN-2, PSEN1) by interaction with APH-1. In addition, CXCR1 established an interaction with the α-secretase ADAM10. Second-order interactions of CXCR1 and PAR-2 with the γ-secretase complex were further established through CXCR1-BSG-PSEN1 and PAR-2-TMED2-NCSTN. The latter sequence of interactions may point to a shared pathway of membrane trafficking for PAR-2 and the γ-secretase complex. TMED2 is involved in anterograde COPII vesicle-mediated trafficking of G-protein-coupled receptors and nicastrin (NCSTN) has been described to play a role in γ-secretase trafficking (22Zhang X. Hoey R.J. Lin G. Koide A. Leung B. Ahn K. Dolios G. Paduch M. Ikeuchi T. Wang R. Li Y.M. Koide S. Sisodia S.S. Identification of a tetratricopeptide repeat-like domain in the nicastrin subunit of γ-secretase using synthetic antibodies.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2012; 109: 8534-8539Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). The immunoglobulin family member basigin or CD147 (BSG) is known as a regulator of γ-secretase activity as well as inducer of MMP and as a receptor for the chemotactic cyclophilins (23Yurchenko V. Constant S. Bukrinsky M. Dealing with the family: CD147 interactions with cyclophilins.Immunology. 2006; 117: 301-309Crossref PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar). Moreover, the expanded network (Fig. 3) visualized how CXCR1 and PAR-2 are linked by the γ-secretase complex to functional protein interaction clusters of cell cycle control and the cadherins/catenins (24Jeon A.H. Böhm C. Chen F. Huo H. Ruan X. Ren C.H. Ho K. Qamar S. Mathews P.M. Fraser P.E. Mount H.T. S.t George-Hyslop P. Schmitt-Ulms G.

Chem. 2013; 288: 15352-15366Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar). Taken together, these results support an association of CXCR1 and PAR-2 with the γ-secretase complex, which is mediated by APH-1 and may be regulated by basigin. Our studies so far provided evidence that secretases, PAR-2, and CXCR1 colocalize and physically interact and indicate that this interaction is involved in regulation of CXCR1 expression. Although CXCR1 expression in neutrophils has been analyzed and defined in detail, the expression and subcellular localization characteristics of PAR-2 in human neutrophils are poorly"
https://openalex.org/W2026198504,"The nutritional composition of diets can vary widely in nature and have large effects on the growth, reproduction and survival of animals. Many animals, especially herbivores, will tightly regulate the nutritional composition of their body, which has been referred to as nutritional homeostasis. We tested how experimental manipulation of the lipid and protein content of live prey affected the nutrient reserves and subsequent diet regulation of web-building spiders, Argiope keyserlingi. Live locusts were injected with experimental solutions containing specific amounts of lipid and protein and then fed to spiders. The nutrient composition of the spiders' bodies was directly related to the nutrient composition of the prey on which they fed. We then conducted an experiment where spiders were fed either high lipid or high protein prey and subsequently provided with two large unmanipulated locusts. Prior diet did not affect the amount or ratio of lipid and protein ingested by spiders when feeding on unmanipulated prey. Argiope keyserlingi were flexible in the storage of lipid and protein in their bodies and did not bias their extraction of nutrients from prey to compensate for previously biased diets. Some carnivores, especially those that experience frequent food limitation, may be less likely to strictly regulate their body composition than herbivores because food limitation may encourage opportunistic ingestion and assimilation of nutrients."
https://openalex.org/W2072263704,"We tested whether adenosine, a cytoprotective mediator and trigger of preconditioning, could protect endothelial cells from inflammation-induced deficits in mitochondrial biogenesis and function. We examined this question using human microvascular endothelial cells exposed to TNFα. TNFα produced time and dose-dependent decreases in mitochondrial membrane potential, cellular ATP levels, and mitochondrial mass, preceding an increase in apoptosis. These effects were prevented by co-incubation with adenosine, a nitric oxide (NO) donor, a guanylate cyclase (GC) activator, or a cell-permeant cyclic GMP (cGMP) analog. The effects of adenosine were blocked by a nitric oxide synthase inhibitor, a soluble guanylate cyclase inhibitor, a morpholino antisense oligonucleotide to endothelial nitric oxide synthase (eNOS), or siRNA knockdown of the transcriptional coactivator, PGC-1α. Incubation with exogenous NO, a GC activator, or a cGMP analog reversed the effect of eNOS knockdown, while the effect of NO was blocked by inhibition of GC. The protective effects of NO and cGMP analog were prevented by siRNA to PGC-1α. TNFα also decreased expression of eNOS, cellular NO levels, and PGC-1α expression, which were reversed by adenosine. Exogenous NO, but not adenosine, rescued expression of PGC-1α in cells in which eNOS expression was knocked down by eNOS antisense treatment. Thus, TNFα elicits decreases in endothelial mitochondrial function and mass, and an increase in apoptosis. These effects were reversed by adenosine, an effect mediated by eNOS-synthesized NO, acting via soluble guanylate cyclase/cGMP to activate a mitochondrial biogenesis regulatory program under the control of PGC-1α. These results support the existence of an adenosine-triggered, mito-and cytoprotective mechanism dependent upon an eNOS-PGC-1α regulatory pathway, which acts to preserve endothelial mitochondrial function and mass during inflammatory challenge."
https://openalex.org/W2005805706,"Objectives To describe the distribution of apolipoprotein E (APOE) genotypes among an elderly Chinese patient population with memory complaints treated in a memory clinic in Beijing and to compare the ε4 allele frequency among individuals with subjective cognitive impairment (SCI), mild cognitive impairment (MCI) and Alzheimer's disease (AD). Methods A total of 385 subjects with memory complaints participated in the study, including 216 patients with AD, 56 with MCI, 17 with SCI, and 96 with other types of cognitive impairment. A total of 75 healthy elderly control subjects were also recruited. The polymerase chain reaction-restriction fragment length polymorphism (PCR-RFLP) technique was used to investigate the APOE genotypes. Results The frequency of the ε4 allele was 19.6 percent for the entire sample of patients who had memory complaints. The APOE allele distribution differed between women and men (22.6% and 14.9%, respectively; p<0.05) in the individuals with memory complaints. Compared with the control group (7.3%), the prevalence of the APOE ε4 allele was significantly higher in the AD (23.6%) and MCI (21.4%) groups and was slightly increased in the SCI (14.7%) group. Conclusions In the memory clinic, we observed a higher prevalence of the APOE ε4 allele among Chinese AD and MCI patients. A similar trend was observed in patients with SCI. These findings suggest that nondemented APOE ε4 allele carriers with memory complaints may have a greater genetic risk for AD and should be monitored more closely."

Our objective was to evaluate the impact of interleukin 28B single nucleotide polymorphism (rs12979860, rs8099917) variability in HCV genotype 3 infected populations. Methods 400 hepatitis C seroreactive patients from different population groups in Eastern and North Eastern part of India were assessed for host and viral genotypic analysis. 83 HCV genotype 3 infected patients were administered pegylated interferon- ribavirin therapy. Viral genotyping was performed using nested reverse transcriptase-PCR followed by direct sequencing methods. Host interleukin 28B genotyping was performed using real-time PCR based single nucleotide polymorphism analysis. Results Out of 400 hepatitis C seroreactive individuals, 73.25% were found to be RNA positive. HCV genotype 3 (65.87%) was found to be the major circulating strain in this region followed by genotype 1 (32.08%). rs12979860 CC genotype was significantly associated with sustained virological response in HCV genotype 3 infected population. In patients achieving rapid virological response, favourable CC/TT allele at rs12979860, rs8099917 was found to be predominant at both the alleles at 77%, 73.2% respectively; whereas in case of patients with relapsed HCV infection CT, TG alleles were found to be predominant. Additionally, CC genotypes at rs12979860 were found to be associated with sustained virological response in patients with high viral load (OR = 6.75, 0.05<p). HCV unfavourable rs12979860 TT, rs8099917 GG alleles were present in 34%, 27.6% patients with relapsed HCV infection respectively. Also unfavourable CT, TG genotypes were found to be predominant in patients with advanced stages of liver disease. Conclusion CC, TT the two favourable markers at SNPs rs12979860 and rs8099917 are strongly associated with sustained virological response in genotype 3 infected populations. This information will aid clinicians to effectively design response based treatment regimen."
https://openalex.org/W1990682547,"Repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation is usually applied to visual cortex to explore the effects on cortical excitability. Most researchers therefore concentrate on changes of phosphene threshold, rarely on consequences for visual performance. Thus, we investigated peripheral visual acuity in the four quadrants of the visual field using Landolt C optotypes before and after repetitive stimulation of the visual cortex. We applied continuous and intermittend theta burst stimulation with various stimulation intensities (60%, 80%, 100%, 120% of individual phosphene threshold) as well as monophasic and biphasic 1 Hz stimulation, respectively. As an important result, no serious adverse effects were observed. In particular, no seizure was induced, even with theta burst stimulation applied with 120% of individual phosphene threshold. In only one case stimulation was ceased because the subject reported intolerable pain. Baseline visual acuity decreased over sessions, indicating a continuous training effect. Unexpectedly, none of the applied transcranial magnetic stimulation protocols had an effect on performance: no change in visual acuity was found in any of the four quadrants of the visual field. Binocular viewing as well as the use of peripheral instead of foveal presentation of the stimuli might have contributed to this result. Furthermore, intraindividual variability could have masked the TMS- induced effects on visual acuity."
https://openalex.org/W2053150437,"Grassland managements can affect carbon (C) and nitrogen (N) storage in grassland ecosystems with consequent feedbacks to climate change. We investigated the impacts of compound fertilization and clipping on grass biomass, plant and soil (0–20 cm depth) C, N storage, plant and soil C: N ratios, soil microbial activity and diversity, and C, N sequestration rates in grassland in situ in the National Dalaoling Forest Park of China beginning July, 2011. In July, 2012, the fertilization increased total biomass by 30.1%, plant C by 34.5%, plant N by 79.8%, soil C by 18.8% and soil N by 23.8% compared with the control, respectively. Whereas the clipping decreased total biomass, plant C and N, soil C and N by 24.9%, 30.3%, 39.3%, 18.5%, and 19.4%, respectively, when compared to the control. The plant C: N ratio was lower for the fertilization than for the control and the clipping treatments. The soil microbial activity and diversity indices were higher for the fertilization than for the control. The clipping generally exhibited a lower level of soil microbial activity and diversity compared to the control. The principal component analysis indicated that the soil microbial communities of the control, fertilization and clipping treatments formed three distinct groups. The plant C and N sequestration rates of the fertilization were significantly higher than the clipping treatment. Our results suggest that fertilization is an efficient management practice in improving the C and N storage of the grassland ecosystem via increasing the grass biomass and soil microbial activity and diversity."
https://openalex.org/W2081339030,"Four distinct serotypes of dengue viruses (DENV) are the cause of re-emerging dengue fever (DF) and dengue hemorrhagic fever (DHF). Dengue circulation in the Caribbean has gone from none or single serotype to multiple serotypes co-circulating with reports of continuing cycles of progressively more severe disease in the region. Few studies have investigated dengue on Sint Eustatius. Blood samples were collected to determine the prevalence of antibodies against dengue in the Sint Eustatius population. Greater than 90% of the serum samples (184 of 204) were positive for anti-flavivirus antibodies by enzyme linked immunosorbance assay (ELISA). Plaque reduction neutralization test (PRNT), specific for dengue viruses, showed that 171 of these 184 flavivirus antibody positive sera had a neutralization titer against one or more DENV serotypes. A majority of the sera (62%) had neutralizing antibody to all four dengue serotypes. Only 26 PRNT positive sera (15%) had monotypic dengue virus neutralizing antibody, most of which (20 of 26) were against DENV2. Evidence of infection with all four serotypes was observed across all age groups except in the youngest age group (10-19 years) which contained only DENV2 positive individuals. In a multiple logistic regression model, only the length of residence on the island was a predictor of a positive dengue PRNT50 result. To our knowledge this is the first dengue serosurveillance study conducted on Sint Eustatius since the 1970s. The lack of antibodies to the DEN1, 3, and 4 in the samples collected from participants under 20 years of age suggests that only DEN2 has circulated on island since the early 1990s. The high prevalence of antibodies against dengue (83.8%) and the observation that the length of time on the island was the strongest predictor of infection suggests dengue is endemic on Sint Eustatius and a public health concern that warrants further investigation."
https://openalex.org/W1970021025,"Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb) synthesizes polymethylated polysaccharides that form complexes with long chain fatty acids. These complexes, referred to as methylglucose lipopolysaccharides (MGLPs), regulate fatty acid biosynthesis in vivo, including biosynthesis of mycolic acids that are essential for building the cell wall. Glucosyl-3-phosphoglycerate phosphatase (GpgP, EC 5.4.2.1), encoded by Rv2419c gene, catalyzes the second step of the pathway for the biosynthesis of MGLPs. The molecular basis for this dephosphorylation is currently not understood. Here, we describe the crystal structures of apo-, vanadate-bound, and phosphate-bound MtbGpgP, depicting unliganded, reaction intermediate mimic, and product-bound views of MtbGpgP, respectively. The enzyme consists of a single domain made up of a central β-sheet flanked by α-helices on either side. The active site is located in a positively charged cleft situated above the central β-sheet. Unambiguous electron density for vanadate covalently bound to His(11), mimicking the phosphohistidine intermediate, was observed. The role of residues interacting with the ligands in catalysis was probed by site-directed mutagenesis. Arg(10), His(11), Asn(17), Gln(23), Arg(60), Glu(84), His(159), and Leu(209) are important for enzymatic activity. Comparison of the structures of MtbGpgP revealed conformational changes in a key loop region connecting β1 with α1. This loop regulates access to the active site. MtbGpgP functions as dimer. L209E mutation resulted in monomeric GpgP, rendering the enzyme incapable of dephosphorylation. The structures of GpgP reported here are the first crystal structures for histidine-phosphatase-type GpgPs. These structures shed light on a key step in biosynthesis of MGLPs that could be targeted for development of anti-tuberculosis therapeutics."

These genes, which were identified based on homology to genes of known effect in other study systems, were initially sequenced from a panel of improved lines. All genes that exhibited a paucity of sequence diversity, consistent with the possible effects of selection during the evolution of cultivated sunflower, were then sequenced from a panel of wild sunflower accessions an outgroup. These data enabled formal tests for the effects of selection in shaping sequence diversity at these loci. When selection was detected, we further sequenced these genes from a panel of primitive landraces, thereby allowing us to investigate the likely timing of selection (i.e., domestication vs. improvement). We ultimately identified seven genes that exhibited the signature of positive selection during either domestication or improvement. Genetic mapping of a subset of these genes revealed co-localization between candidates for genes involved in the determination of flowering time, seed germination, plant growth/development, and branching and QTL that were previously identified for these traits in cultivated × wild sunflower mapping populations."
https://openalex.org/W2150335972,"Cross-boundary nutrient inputs can enhance and sustain populations of organisms in nutrient-poor recipient ecosystems. For example, Pacific salmon (Oncorhynchus spp.) can deliver large amounts of marine-derived nutrients to freshwater ecosystems through their eggs, excretion, or carcasses. This has led to the question of whether nutrients from one generation of salmon can benefit juvenile salmon from subsequent generations. In a study of 12 streams on the central coast of British Columbia, we found that the abundance of juvenile coho salmon was most closely correlated with the abundance of adult pink salmon from previous years. There was a secondary role for adult chum salmon and watershed size, followed by other physical characteristics of streams. Most of the coho sampled emerged in the spring, and had little to no direct contact with spawning salmon nutrients at the time of sampling in the summer and fall. A combination of techniques suggest that subsidies from spawning salmon can have a strong, positive, time-delayed influence on the productivity of salmon-bearing streams through indirect effects from previous spawning events. This is the first study on the impacts of nutrients from naturally-occurring spawning salmon on juvenile population abundance of other salmon species."

https://openalex.org/W2085087772,"Background Previous studies have analyzed factors associated with renal infarction so that patients can be provided with earlier diagnosis and treatment. However, the factors associated with development of chronic kidney disease (CKD) following renal infarction are unknown. Methods We retrospectively reviewed the records of patients with a diagnosis of renal infarction based on enhanced computed tomography. All patients were admitted to a single emergency department in Taiwan from 1999 to 2008. Univariate and multivariate analysis were used to assess the effect of different factors on development of CKD based on estimates of the glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) at admission and at 3–12 months after discharge. Results Univariate analysis indicated significantly increased risk of CKD in patients older than 50 years, with symptoms for 24 h or less before admission, lower eGFR at admission, APACHE II score greater than 7, SOFA score greater than 1, ASA score greater than 2, and SAPS II score greater than 15. Multivariate analysis indicated that only SOFA score greater than 1 was significantly and independently associated with CKD at follow-up (p<0.001). Conclusions A total of 32.5% of patients admitted for renal infarction over a ten-year period developed CKD at 3–12 months after discharge. A SOFA score greater than 1 was significantly and independently associated with development of CKD in these patients."
https://openalex.org/W2110781832,"Background & Aims Hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg) seroclearance and seroconversion are regarded as favorable outcomes of chronic hepatitis B (CHB). This study aimed to develop artificial neural networks (ANNs) that could accurately predict HBsAg seroclearance or seroconversion on the basis of available serum variables. Methods Data from 203 untreated, HBeAg-negative CHB patients with spontaneous HBsAg seroclearance (63 with HBsAg seroconversion), and 203 age- and sex-matched HBeAg-negative controls were analyzed. ANNs and logistic regression models (LRMs) were built and tested according to HBsAg seroclearance and seroconversion. Predictive accuracy was assessed with area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUROC). Results Serum quantitative HBsAg (qHBsAg) and HBV DNA levels, qHBsAg and HBV DNA reduction were related to HBsAg seroclearance (P<0.001) and were used for ANN/LRM-HBsAg seroclearance building, whereas, qHBsAg reduction was not associated with ANN-HBsAg seroconversion (P = 0.197) and LRM-HBsAg seroconversion was solely based on qHBsAg (P = 0.01). For HBsAg seroclearance, AUROCs of ANN were 0.96, 0.93 and 0.95 for the training, testing and genotype B subgroups respectively. They were significantly higher than those of LRM, qHBsAg and HBV DNA (all P<0.05). Although the performance of ANN-HBsAg seroconversion (AUROC 0.757) was inferior to that for HBsAg seroclearance, it tended to be better than those of LRM, qHBsAg and HBV DNA. Conclusions ANN identifies spontaneous HBsAg seroclearance in HBeAg-negative CHB patients with better accuracy, on the basis of easily available serum data. More useful predictors for HBsAg seroconversion are still needed to be explored in the future."
https://openalex.org/W2024229823,"The status of the maternal endometrium is vital in regulating humoral homeostasis and for ensuring embryo implantation. Cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulators (CFTR) and epithelial sodium channel alpha subunits (ENaC-α) play an important role in female reproduction by maintaining humoral and cell homeostasis. However, it is not clear whether the expression levels of CFTR and ENaC-α in the decidual component during early pregnancy are related with early miscarriage. CBA×DBA/2 mouse mating has been widely accepted as a classical model of early miscarriage. The abortion rate associated with this mating was 33.33% in our study. The decidua of abortion-prone CBA female mice (DBA/2 mated) had higher CFTR mRNA and protein expression and lower ENaC-α mRNA and protein expression, compared to normal pregnant CBA mice (BLAB/C mated). Furthermore, increased CFTR expression and decreased ENaC-α expression were observed in the uterine tissue from women with early miscarriage, as compared to those with successful pregnancy. In conclusion, increased CFTR expression and decreased ENaC-α expression in the decidua of early abortion may relate with failure of early pregnancy."
https://openalex.org/W2085648919,"Background HPV vaccination programs have adversely affected participation in future cervical cancer screening. The purpose of this study is to determine the influence of decision satisfaction with accepting/rejecting the HPV vaccine, as well as traditional clinical factors, on the intent to participate in future screening. Methods and Findings From January 2011 through August 2012 women 18–26 years old presenting for health care in an urban college student health and wellness clinic in the US Midwest were asked to complete a descriptive and medical history survey including a six element decisional satisfaction survey scored on 5-point Likert scales, where the intent to participate in future cervical cancer screening was measured. Of the 568 women who completed the decisional satisfaction survey, 17% of those <21 years and 7% ≥21 years indicated no intent to participate in future cervical cancer screenings. Among women of current screening age, the univariate risk factors of race/ethnicity, contraceptive use, number of lifetime sexual partners, and receipt of HPV vaccine were not predictors of intent for future cervical cancer screening. Instead, only a history of a prior Pap test was a significant positive predictor and only a decisional satisfaction of ‘neutral’ (Likert score = 3) for any of the four decisional satisfaction elements was a significant negative predictor. For the decisional satisfaction element “best for me personally”, there was a 78% decreased likelihood of intending to participate in future screening if the satisfaction was neutral rather than firm (aOR = 0.22, 95% CI: 0.05–0.91) and a 26 fold increased likelihood if she had had a prior Pap test (aOR = 26, 95% CI: 5–133). Conclusions HPV vaccination implementation programs must help women be the owner of their decision around HPV vaccination and understand the importance of future participation in cervical cancer screening."
