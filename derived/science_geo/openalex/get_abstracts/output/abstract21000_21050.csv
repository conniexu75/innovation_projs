https://openalex.org/W1975771868,"The neurogenic loci Notch and Delta, which both encode EGF-homologous transmembrane proteins, appear to function together in mediating cell-cell communication and have been shown to interact at the cell surface in vitro. To examine the role of the EGF repeats in this interaction, we performed an extensive deletion mutagenesis of the extracellular domain of Notch. We find that of the 36 EGF repeats of Notch, only two, 11 and 12, are both necessary and sufficient to mediate interactions with Delta. Furthermore, this Delta binding ability is conserved in the corresponding two repeats from the Xenopus Notch homolog. We report a novel molecular interaction between Notch and Serrate, another EGF-homologous transmembrane protein containing a region of striking similarity to Delta, and show that the same two EGF repeats of Notch also constitute a Serrate binding domain. These results suggest that Notch may act as a multifunctional receptor whose 36 EGF repeats form a tandem array of discrete ligand-binding units, each of which may potentially interact with several different proteins during development."
https://openalex.org/W2152013874,"The rate of long-distance electron transfer in proteins rapidly decreases with distance, which is indicative of an electron tunneling process. Calculations predict that the distance dependence of electron transfer in native proteins is controlled by the protein's structural motif. The helix and sheet content of a protein and the tertiary arrangement of these secondary structural units define the distance dependence of electronic coupling in that protein. The calculations use a tunneling pathway model applied previously with success to ruthenated proteins. The analysis ranks the average distance decay constant for electronic coupling in electron transfer proteins and identifies the amino acids that are coupled to the charge localization site more strongly or weakly than average for their distance."
https://openalex.org/W2008999766,"Expression cloning from a pool of gastrula cDNAs identified the Wnt family member Xwnt-8 as having dorsal axis-inducing activity in Xenopus embryos. Microinjected Xwnt-8 mRNA was able to rescue the development of a dorsally complete anterior-posterior axis in embryos ventralized by exposure to UV light. Axis induction was observed in embryos injected in either marginal or vegetal blastomeres at the 32-cell stage. Vegetal blastomeres receiving Xwnt-8 mRNA contributed progeny not to the induced dorsal axis, but to the endoderm, a result consistent with Xwnt-8 causing cells to act as a Nieuwkoop center (the vegetal-inducing component of normal dorsal axis formation), rather than as a Spemann organizer (the induced dorsal marginal zone component that directly forms the dorsal mesoderm). Xwnt-8, which is normally expressed ventrally in midgastrula and neurula embryos, appears to mimic, when injected, maternally encoded dorsal mesoderm-inducing factors that act early in development."

https://openalex.org/W2008415422,"Human papillomavirus (HPV) types 16 and 18 appear to play a role in the development of ano-genital malignancies, whereas HPV 6 and 11 are usually associated with benign lesions. One HPV16 oncoprotein, E6, complexes with and promotes degradation of the cellular tumor suppressor p53. Here we show that E6 proteins of both oncogenic and benign HPV types associate in vitro with p53, but binding by E6 proteins of benign HPV types cannot target p53 for degradation. A C-terminal region of E6 conserved among all HPV types is important for p53 binding. However, N-terminal sequences of E6 conserved only between oncogenic HPV types are necessary to direct p53 degradation. p53 binding by E6 appears necessary but not sufficient for this activity. All E6 proteins tested showed comparable transcriptional trans-activating activity, a property that does not require the ability to bind or direct degradation of p53."
https://openalex.org/W1516318762,"Mutants of Escherichia coli lacking superoxide dismutase (SOD) activity were used to explore the sensitivity of aconitase toward O2 and O2-. The aconitase activity in SOD-free extracts was rapidly lost under aerobic conditions and exogenous SOD afforded a concentration-dependent protection. The rate of the inactivating reaction between O2- and aconitase was estimated to be of the order of 10(9) M-1 s-1. The competitive inhibitors fluorocitrate and tricarballylate provided some protection, and at saturating concentrations, they decreased the rate of the inactivating reaction by 100- and 10-fold, respectively. Aconitase was markedly less sensitive to O2 than it was to O2-. Aerobic growth on succinate involves a greater dependence upon aconitase than does growth on glucose and, as expected, the deleterious consequences of SOD deficiency were more pronounced on succinate than on glucose. Moreover, aconitase activity was lower in extracts of aerobically grown SOD mutants, than it was in the parental strain. We suppose that inactivation of aconitase by O2- involves oxidative attack on the prosthetic iron-sulfur cluster. The extreme sensitivity of aconitase to inactivation by O2- suggests that its inactivation will be an early event in the oxidative stress imposed by hyperoxia, ultraviolet irradiation or redox-cycling agents, such as viologens or quinones."
https://openalex.org/W2125269304,"Although L-type voltage-sensitive calcium channels (VSCCs) have been well characterized electrophysiologically, their role in synaptic physiology has remained unclear. To assess their involvement in synaptic regulation of gene expression, we have examined the effects of selective VSCC antagonists on basal, synaptically mediated activation of several transcription factor genes in cultured cortical neurons. Basal expression of c-fos, jun-B, zif268, and fos-B is rapidly suppressed by exposure to L-type VSCC antagonists and increased by (-)BayK-8644, a VSCC agonist. Although VSCC antagonists block kainate-induced rises in intracellular calcium and gene expression, these agents have little effect on spontaneous electrical activity or synaptically induced calcium transients in these neurons. These findings suggest that even though L-type VSCCs contribute a relatively minor component of synaptic calcium transients, they appear to play a key role in coupling synaptic excitation to activation of transcriptional events thought to contribute to neuronal plasticity."
https://openalex.org/W2069039144,"Brefeldin A (BFA) is a fungal metabolite that causes a redistribution of the stacked cisternae of the Golgi complex into the endoplasmic reticulum by inhibiting anterograde transport. We report that BFA also causes membrane tubules derived from the trans-Golgi network (TGN) to fuse with early endosomes. In the presence of BFA, a mannose-6-phosphate receptor (M6PR)-enriched tubular network rapidly forms from the TGN, not from the prelysosomal compartment, and can be labeled with endocytic tracers after only 5 min of uptake at either 20 degrees C or 37 degrees C, indicating that it is also functionally an early endosome. Formation of the TGN-early endosome network is microtubule dependent and may involve modification of membrane processes affected by microtubule-associated motor activity. Concomitant with the formation of the fused TGN-early endosome network, there is a greater than 5-fold increase in cell surface M6PRs. The data suggest that BFA has revealed a membrane transport cycle between the TGN and early endosomes, perhaps used for the secretion or delivery of molecules to the cell surface."
https://openalex.org/W2007289876,"Voltage-gated sodium channels, which are responsible for the generation of action potentials in the brain, are phosphorylated by protein kinase C (PKC) in purified form. Activation of PKC decreases peak sodium current up to 80 percent and slows its inactivation for sodium channels in rat brain neurons and for rat brain type IIA sodium channel alpha subunits heterologously expressed in Chinese hamster ovary cells. These effects are specific for PKC because they can be blocked by specific peptide inhibitors of PKC and can be reproduced by direct application of PKC to the cytoplasmic surface of sodium channels in excised inside-out membrane patches. Modulation of brain sodium channels by PKC is likely to have important effects on signal transduction and synaptic transmission in the central nervous system."

https://openalex.org/W2001842895,"We have localized a G protein activator region of the human beta 2-adrenergic receptor to region beta III-2 (from Arg259 to Lys273). The synthetic beta III-2, corresponding to the C-terminal end of the third cytoplasmic loop, activates Gs at nanomolar concentrations and weakly activates Gi. beta III-2 activates adenylyl cyclase at nanomolar concentrations in wild-type S49 lymphoma membranes, but not in membranes of unc mutant S49 cells, in which Gs is uncoupled from beta-adrenergic stimulation. Phosphorylation of beta III-2 by cAMP-dependent protein kinase A, which is involved in the desensitization of the beta-adrenergic receptor from Gs, drastically reduces the effect of beta III-2 on Gs while potentiating its action on Gi, resulting in a total loss of adenylyl cyclase-stimulating activity. These findings indicate that this receptor sequence is a multipotential G protein activator whose G protein specificity is regulated by protein kinase A."
https://openalex.org/W2034200430,"Sequences encoded by the first exon of BCR that bind to the ABL SH2 domain are essential for the activation of the ABL tyrosine kinase and transforming potential of the chimeric BCR-ABL oncogene. The normal cellular BCR gene encodes a 160,000 dalton phosphoprotein associated with a serine/threonine kinase activity, but it shows only weak dispersed homologies to protein kinases. p160c-BCR was purified to apparent homogeneity as an oligomer of greater than 600,000 daltons that contains autophosphorylation activity and transphosphorylation activity for several protein substrates. A region containing paired cysteine residues within the 426 amino acids encoded by the first exon of BCR is essential for its novel phosphotransferase activity, which overlaps with the strong SH2-binding regions. The recent demonstration of a GTPase-activating function within the C-terminal portion of BCR suggests that the protein kinase and SH2-binding domains may work in concert with other regions of the molecule in intracellular signalling processes."

https://openalex.org/W1537167627,"Two short-lived precursor proteins, pp37 and pp32, of the mitochondrial phosphoprotein pp30 (formerly denoted as ib) have been detected in Bt2cAMP-stimulated rat adrenal cortex cells, incubated at 25 degrees C or with 1,10-ortho-phenanthroline at 37 degrees C. Subsequently, these two precursor proteins were also identified in cells incubated at 37 degrees C, where they are present only at low levels due to their short half-life. pp30 is produced in several steroidogenic tissues in response to trophic hormone or second messenger analogue. pp37 and pp32 are also phosphoproteins located in the mitochondrion that are produced in response to cAMP analogue and give rise to proteolytic peptide maps similar to that of pp30. As for pp30, inhibition of cytosolic translation prevents the production of pp37 and pp32. The larger precursor protein pp37 has an apparent molecular mass of 37 kDa, an isoelectric point of approximately 7.1, and a half-life at 37 degrees C of 3-4 min. Pulse-chase studies indicate that this protein is processed into the smaller protein, pp32, which has an apparent molecular mass of 32 kDa, an isoelectric point of approximately 6.4, and a half-life at 37 degrees C of 3-4 min. This latter protein is the immediate precursor of pp30. Since ortho-phenanthroline inhibits the mitochondrial processing protease, while the lower incubation temperature slows both protein import and protease processing, the experimental conditions necessary to detect these proteins are consistent with pp37 being a precursor protein that contains two cleavable presequences and is imported into the mitochondrion. The sequential removal of these sequences produces the mature protein pp30."
https://openalex.org/W2001295380,"The unique cytoplasmic loop regions of the alpha 1, alpha 2, alpha 3, and alpha 5 subunits of the GABAA receptor were expressed in bacterial and used to produce subunit-specific polyclonal antisera. Antibodies immobilized on protein A-Sepharose were used to isolate naturally occurring alpha-specific populations of GABAA receptors from rat brain that retained the ability to bind [3H]muscimol, [3H]flunitrazepam, [3H]Ro15-1788, and [125I]iodo-clonazepam with high affinity. Pharmacological characterization of these subtypes revealed marked differences between the isolated receptor populations and was generally in agreement with the reported pharmacological profiles of GABAA receptors in cells transiently transfected with alpha 1 beta 1 gamma 2, alpha 2 beta 1 gamma 2, alpha 3 beta 1 gamma 2, and alpha 5 beta 1 gamma 2 combinations of subunits. Additional subtypes were also identified that bind [3H]muscimol but do not bind benzodiazepines with high affinity. The majority of GABAA receptor oligomers contains only a single type of alpha subunit, and we conclude that alpha 1, alpha 2, alpha 3, and alpha 5 subunits exist in vivo in combination with the beta subunit and gamma 2 subunit."
https://openalex.org/W1554264637,"Abstract The ubiquitous and amiloride-sensitive Na+/H+ exchanger (NHE-1), a plasma membrane phosphoglycoprotein that regulates intracellular pH, is rapidly activated by growth factors. We showed previously that epidermal growth factor (EGF), alpha-thrombin, or serum stimulates Na+/H+ exchange activity in growth-arrested Chinese hamster lung fibroblasts (ER22 cells) in a time-dependent manner which correlates with increased phosphorylation of at serine residues (Sardet, C., Counillon, L., Franchi, A., and Pouyssegur, J. (1990) Science 247, 723-726). Here we show that the tumor promoter, okadaic acid, a potent in vivo inhibitor of serine/threonine protein phosphatases 1 (PP1) and 2A (PP2A), stimulates Na+/H+ exchange in G0-arrested ER22 cells and in exchanger-deficient fibroblasts transfected with the human cDNA. Okadaic acid effects are maximal at 1 microM (EC50 = 500 nM), detected in 2 min, complete within 15-20 min, and are additives when combined with EGF or alpha-thrombin. Parallel to the pHi-induced rise, okadaic acid alone or together with growth factors stimulated the phosphorylation of NHE-1. More importantly tryptic phosphopeptide maps of NHE-1, immunoprecipitated from cells treated with EGF, alpha-thrombin, or okadaic acid, show a common pattern of phosphorylation. This pattern consists of five major 32P-labeled peptides (P1-P5) present in lower amounts in resting cells. One of them, P5, barely detectable in resting cells is increased up to 15-fold in mitogen-stimulated cells. Taken together these results reinforce the notion that phosphorylation of controls the set point value of the exchanger and suggest that: (i) the proximate step in Na+/H+ exchange activation is mediated by as yet unidentified growth factor-activatable serine NHE-1 kinase(s) and (ii) this kinase(s), partly active in resting cells, integrate signals from receptor tyrosine kinases and G protein-coupled receptors."
https://openalex.org/W2112984407,"Two Drosophila receptor-like tyrosine phosphatase genes, DPTP99A and DPTP10D, were characterized. Protein products of these genes show distinct expression patterns specific to subsets of developing CNS axons. DPTP99A expression coincides with the onset of axonogenesis and is expressed in several pioneer neurons, including aCC and RP2, which pioneer the intersegmental nerve; its proteins are transiently expressed in the intersegmental and segmental nerves, arguing for a role in the establishment of these nerves. Both genes produce complex sets of transcripts, owing to the alternative utilization of exons and polyadenylation sites. Each gene produces alternative protein forms, which differ in their C-terminal tails. The deduced proteins possess extracellular FN-III repeats and intracellular PTPase domain(s). We discuss the implications of these results and the role of protein tyrosine dephosphorylation in axon outgrowth and guidance."
https://openalex.org/W1632558799,"The MET proto-oncogene encodes a transmembrane tyrosine kinase receptor for HGF (p190MET). In this work, p190MET was immunoprecipitated, allowed to phosphorylate in the presence of [gamma-32P]ATP, and digested with trypsin. A major phosphopeptide was purified by reverse phase chromatography. The phosphorylated tyrosine was identified as residue 1235 (Tyr1235) by Edman covalent radiosequencing. A synthetic peptide derived from the corresponding MET sequence was phosphorylated by p190MET in an in vitro assay and coeluted in reverse phase chromatography. Tyr1235 lies within the tyrosine kinase domain of p190MET, within a canonical tyrosine autophosphorylation site that shares homology with the corresponding region of the insulin, CSF-1 and platelet-derived growth factor receptors, and of p60src and p130gag-fps. The p190MET kinase is constitutively phosphorylated on tryosine in a gastric carcinoma cell line (GTL16), due to the amplification and overexpression of the MET gene. Metabolic labeling of GTL-16 cells with [32P]orthophosphate followed by immunoprecipitation and tryptic phosphopeptide mapping of p190MET showed that Tyr1235 is a major site of tyrosine phosphorylation in vivo as well. Since phosphorylation activates p190MET kinase, we propose a regulatory role for Tyr1235."
https://openalex.org/W1896621431,"Chimeric insulin/insulin-like growth factor-1 receptors and insulin receptor alpha-subunit point mutants were characterized with respect to their binding properties for insulin and insulin-like growth factor-1 (IGF-1) and their ability to translate ligand interaction into tyrosine kinase activation in intact cells. We found that replacement of the amino-terminal 137 amino acids of the insulin receptor (IR) with the corresponding 131 amino acids of the IGF-1 receptor (IGF-1R) resulted in loss of affinity for both ligands. Further replacement of the adjacent cysteine region with IGF-1R sequences fully reconstituted affinity for IGF-1, but only marginally for insulin. Unexpectedly, replacement of the IR cysteine-rich domain alone by IGF-1R sequences created a high affinity receptor for both insulin and IGF-1. The binding characteristics of all receptor chimeras reflected the potential of both ligands to regulate the receptor tyrosine kinase activity in intact cells. Our chimeric receptor data, in conjunction with IR amino-terminal domain point mutants, strongly suggest major contributions of structural determinants in both amino- and carboxyl-terminal IR alpha-subunit regions for the formation of the insulin-binding pocket, whereas, surprisingly, the residues defining IGF-1 binding are present predominantly in the cysteine-rich domain of the IGF-1R."
https://openalex.org/W1494702869,"The formation and disappearance of a photosensitive species during the reaction of reduced cytochrome c oxidase (putatively a3II.O2), EC 1.9.3.1, has been followed by (a) mixing a3II.CO with O2 in a stopped flow apparatus; (b) initiating the oxygen-oxidase reaction by removing CO with a laser flash; (c) probing the reaction mixture for photosensitivity with a second laser flash. Photosensitivity appears in the reaction mixture after the first laser flash, reaches a maximum after 50-60 microseconds ([O2] greater than 100 microM), and disappears in a further 50-100 microseconds. The kinetics can be represented by the scheme [formula: see text]. In species B, O2 is associated with the protein, possibly CuB, but not with the heme. Species C is the photosensitive a3II.O2 complex, and in D, a3 iron has been oxidized. The formation of species C is responsible for the rapid phase of absorbance change in the oxidase-oxygen reaction. The rate of reaction with oxygen approaches the limit of 35,000 s-1 at high oxygen. Nitric oxide, however, reacts with FeII oxidase with a rate of 1 x 10(8) M-1 s-1, which is accurately maintained up to an observed rate of 10(5) s-1. In flash photolysis experiments, approximately half of the photodissociated nitric oxidase recombines in a biphasic geminate reaction with rates of 1 x 10(8) s-1 and 1 x 10(7) s-1."
https://openalex.org/W1974773169,"Wilms tumor has been associated with genomic alterations at both the 11p13 and 11p15 regions. To differentiate between the involvement of these two loci, a chromosome 11 was constructed that had one or the other region deleted, and this chromosome was introduced into the tumorigenic Wilms tumor cell line G401. When assayed for tumor-forming activity in nude mice, the 11p13-deleted, but not the 11p15.5-p14.1-deleted chromosome, retained its ability to suppress tumor formation. These results provide in vivo functional evidence for the existence of a second genetic locus (WT2) involved in suppressing the tumorigenic phenotype of Wilms tumor."
https://openalex.org/W2344007777,"The p53 gene has been implicated as a tumor-suppressor gene whose disruption is involved in the pathogenesis of common human cancers. The results of extensive analysis of p53 mutations in non-small cell lung cancers (NSCLCs) have revealed that p53 is mutated in 45% of NSCLC with base changes different from those of colon cancer. In this study, we examined 17 SCLC tumor samples taken directly from 15 patients as well as the corresponding nine tumor cell lines. Mutations changing the p53 coding sequence were found in 11 of 15 patients (73.3%) and showed a similar but distinct nucleotide substitution pattern compared with NSCLC, suggesting that a different mutagenic process is involved. In addition, a strong correlation was seen between the presence of p53 mutations in tumors and the successful establishment of the corresponding cell lines, suggesting that p53 mutations can confer a selective growth advantage in vitro (and probably also in vivo)."
https://openalex.org/W1512361626,"Residues 287 to 404 of the rat thyrotropin (TSH) receptor exhibit little homology to gonadotropin receptors. A large segment of this region, residues 303-382, has no determinants important for TSH to bind or elevate cAMP levels nor for the activity of thyroid-stimulating autoantibodies (TSAbs) from the sera of Graves' patients, i.e. deletions, substitutions, or mutations in this segment do not result in a loss of any of these activities in transfected Cos-7 cells. Critical residues for these activities do, however, flank both sides of this segment. Of particular interest, deletion or mutation of residues 299-301 and 387-395 results in a marked decrease in high affinity TSH binding but preserves the ability of a TSAb to increase cAMP levels. Tyrosine 385 is also of particular interest since its mutation to phenylalanine, alanine, threonine, or glutamine results in a receptor with a 20-fold decrease in the ability of TSH to bind or increase cAMP levels, but one whose TSAb activity is, once again, preserved. Because one activity is preserved, we can conclude that (a) the receptor must be fully integrated within the membrane of the cell without malfolding, (b) these sequences represent determinants involved in the high affinity TSH binding site, and (c) separate determinants exist for high affinity TSH binding and TSAb activity, consistent with the existence of autoantibodies in Graves' sera which inhibit TSH binding (TBIAbs) or which increase cAMP levels (TSAbs). Additionally, we show that a 16-mer peptide (residues 352-367), which reacts with the sera of greater than 80% of patients with Graves' disease, can induce the formation of antibodies to a peptide with no sequence homology, residues 377-397. This peptide flanks the region, residues 303-382, with no determinants important for TSH receptor binding or activity. As noted above, it contains residues involved in the high affinity TSH binding site but whose deletion or mutation has no effect on TSAb activity, i.e. residues which would appear to be required at an epitope important for TBIAb but not TSAb antibody activity."
https://openalex.org/W1526187099,"The plasma membrane Ca2+ pump ATPase from porcine aorta was isolated by the calmodulin affinity chromatographic method of Kosk-Kosicka et al. (Kosk-Kosicka, D., Scaillet, S., and Inesi, G. (1986) J. Biol. Chem. 261, 3333-3338). Its activity was restored by adding either phosphatidylcholine or phosphatidylserine. Cyclic GMP-dependent protein kinase (G-kinase) stimulated the enzyme in a concentration-dependent manner. However, phosphatidylinositol kinase (PI-kinase) activity was not detected in the enzyme preparation, and the presence of phosphatidylinositol was not necessary for stimulation by G-kinase. Furthermore, adenosine, a potent PI-kinase inhibitor, did not affect the stimulation. The enzyme preparation contained three major proteins, with molecular masses of 240, 145, and 135 kDa, as assessed by sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. The 240- and 135-kDa proteins were phosphorylated in association with the stimulation by G-kinase, but only the phosphorylation of the 240-kDa protein was dependent on the G-kinase concentration. A purified enzyme without the 240-kDa protein, prepared by our previous method (Imai, S., Yoshida, Y., and Sun, H.-T. (1990) J. Biochem. (Tokyo) 107, 755-761), was not activated by G-kinase. Immunoblotting with an antibody against the human erythrocyte Ca2+ pump revealed that the 135-kDa protein corresponded to one of the isoforms of the plasma membrane Ca2+ pump. These results suggest that the phosphorylation of the 240-kDa protein is responsible for stimulation of the plasma membrane Ca2+ pump ATPase by G-kinase."
https://openalex.org/W2117566528,"The calyx-type synapse of the chick ciliary ganglion was used to examine single calcium channels in a vertebrate cholinergic presynaptic nerve terminal by means of the cell-attached, patch-clamp technique. Calcium channels were recorded on the internal, transmitter-release face of the nerve terminal, but were not detected on the external face. These channels were recruited at −30 mV, with maximum activation at about +30 mV, and were sometimes clustered at high densities. Single-channel conductance estimates with voltage-pulse or-ramp techniques gave values of 11–14 pS with 110 mM barium, which is in the intermediate, N-type range for calcium channels on a control neuron. This nerve terminal calcium channel, termed the NPT-type, may link action potentials to transmitter release at many vertebrate fast-transmitting synapses."
https://openalex.org/W1517629137,"Enzyme I, the first in the sequence of phosphocarrier proteins of the bacterial phosphoenolpyruvate:glycose phosphotransferase system, is a potential critical point for regulating sugar uptake. The thermal stability of Enzyme I was studied by high sensitivity differential scanning calorimetry. At pH 7.5, thermal unfolding of the protein exhibits two peaks with maxima (Tm) at 47.6 and 55.1 degrees C, indicating that the protein comprises two cooperative unfolding structures. Interaction between the two domains is markedly dependent on pH within the range 6.5-8.5. At pH 7.5, catalytic activity was unaffected by heating through the first transition but was lost by heating through the second. Cleavage of Enzyme I (63.5 kDa) by trypsin, chymotrypsin, or Staphylococcus aureus V8 protease yields a 30-kDa fragment, EI-N, containing the NH2 terminus and the active site, His-189. Protease and differential scanning calorimetry experiments show that EI-N is the structural domain corresponding to the cooperative region in the intact enzyme that unfolds at the higher Tm. EI-N catalyzes one activity of Enzyme I; it accepts a phosphoryl group from phosphohistidine-containing phosphocarrier protein but cannot be phosphorylated by phospho-Enzyme I or phosphoenolpyruvate. The phosphoryl transfer between EI-N and the histidine-containing phosphocarrier protein is reversible. Portions of the Salmonella typhimurium ptsI DNA sequence are known; the complete sequence is presented here and compared to Escherichia coli ptsI."
https://openalex.org/W1582511005,"Tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha) has been shown to enhance the synthesis of interleukin-6 (IL-6) and collagenase in human omental microvascular endothelial (HOME) cell (Mawatari, M., Kohno, K., Mizoguchi, H., Matsuda, T., Asoh, K., Van Damme, J. V., Welgus, H. G., and Kuwano, M. (1989) J. Immunol. 143, 1619-1627). In the present study, we have examined whether the TNF-alpha-induced synthesis of IL-6 or collagenase in HOME cells is mediated by an inducible growth factor. Among several growth factors examined, we found that the expression of basic fibroblast growth factor (bFGF) mRNA was the one most prominently enhanced when HOME cells were treated with TNF-alpha. The increase of bFGF mRNA by TNF-alpha in HOME cells was observed in both a dose- and time-dependent manner when assayed by Northern blot analysis. The induction of bFGF mRNA was observed by 3 h after incubation with TNF-alpha, and the maximal increase of 5-fold was obtained after 12 h of incubation with 100 units/ml TNF-alpha. Western blot analysis confirmed the enhanced synthesis of bFGF by TNF-alpha. Metabolic labeling and immunoprecipitation assays of bFGF showed that exposure to TNF-alpha enhanced secretion of bFGF into culture medium and also that TNF-alpha stimulated the production of bFGF molecules with molecular masses of 18, 21, and 22.5 kDa in HOME cells. TNF-alpha induced the expression of collagenase mRNA and IL-6 mRNA in HOME cells as well, and the coadministration of neutralizing anti-bFGF antibody almost completely blocked the effects of TNF-alpha. The treatment of HOME cells with exogenous bFGF significantly stimulated the expression of collagenase mRNA and IL-6 mRNA in HOME cells. Therefore, the biological effects of TNF-alpha on HOME cells may be mediated, at least in part, by TNF-alpha-induced bFGF."
https://openalex.org/W2129039245,"We have utilized molecular biological techniques to demonstrate that rat IIA sodium channels expressed in Xenopus oocytes were blocked by tetrodotoxin (TTX) in a use-dependent manner. This use dependence was the result of an increased affinity of the channels for TTX upon depolarization, most likely due to a conformational change in the channel. Using a mutant with a slower macroscopic rate of inactivation, we have demonstrated that this conformational change is not the transition into the fast-inactivated state. The transition is probably one occurring during activation of the channel, as suggested by the fact that one sodium channel mutant demonstrated comparable depolarizing shifts in the voltage dependence of both activation and use-dependent block by TTX. The transition occurred at potentials more negative than those resulting in channel conductance, suggesting that the conformational change that causes use-dependent block by TTX is a closed-state voltage-dependent gating transition."
https://openalex.org/W1535888286,"The regulatory mechanisms which control the wide array of cellular responses to transforming growth factor beta (TGF beta) are not understood. This report presents evidence that down-regulation of TGF beta receptors on human monocytes may be one mechanism by which the effects of TGF beta are regulated. Treatment of monocytes with interferon gamma (IFN gamma) and lipopolysaccharide for 18 h reduced monocyte receptor number (approximately 400/cell) in a dose-dependent fashion by 89 and 78%, respectively, as determined by 125I-TGF beta binding. Incubation with other cytokines (granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor, macrophage colony-stimulating factor-1, interleukin-1, tumor necrosis factor alpha) did not alter the amount of TGF beta bound. The decrease in 125I-TGF beta binding could not be attributed to competition for receptor sites by secreted TGF beta. Instead, the decline in binding was due to a loss of type I TGF beta receptors, the subtype primarily expressed by monocytes, with no decrease in receptor affinity. Lipopolysaccharide-induced receptor loss was rapid (1-4 h), in contrast to the prolonged (12 h) decline induced by IFN gamma. Loss of receptors was accompanied by a diminished ability of the cells to respond to TGF beta with an induction of TNF alpha mRNA. Thus, this monocyte system is the first example of a heterologous agent causing the down-regulation of TGF beta receptors with a concomitant decline in a TGF beta-stimulated function."
https://openalex.org/W1607668178,"Modeling studies suggest that electrons are transferred from cytochrome c to cytochrome c peroxidase (CcP) with cytochrome c predominantly bound at a site facing the gamma-meso edge of the CcP prosthetic heme group (Poulos, T.L., and Kraut, J. (1980) J. Biol. Chem. 255, 10322-10330). As shown here, guaiacol and ferrocyanide are oxidized at a different site of CcP. Thus, the oxidations of cytochrome c and guaiacol are differentially inactivated by phenylhydrazine and sodium azide. The loss of guaiacol oxidation activity correlates with covalent binding of 1 equivalent of [14C]phenylhydrazine to the protein, whereas the slower loss of cytochrome c activity correlates with the appearance of a 428-nm absorbance maximum attributed to the formation of a sigma-phenyl-iron heme complex. The delta-meso-phenyl and 8-hydroxymethyl derivatives of heme are formed as minor products. Catalytic oxidation of azide to the azidyl radical results in inactivation of CcP and formation of delta-meso-azidoheme. Reconstitution of apo-CcP with delta-meso-azido-, -ethyl-, and -(2-phenylethyl)heme yields holoproteins that give compound I species with H2O2 and exhibit 80, 59, and 31%, respectively, of the control kcat value for cytochrome c oxidation but little or no guaiacol or ferrocyanide oxidizing activity. Conversely, CcP reconstituted with gamma-meso-ethylheme is fully active in the oxidation of guaiacol and ferrocyanide but only retains 27% of the cytochrome c oxidizing activity. These results indicate that guaiacol and ferrocyanide are primarily oxidized near the delta-meso-heme edge rather than, like cytochrome c, at a surface site facing the gamma-meso edge."

https://openalex.org/W1507252795,"The alpha subunits of heterotrimeric GTP-binding (G) proteins act upon ion channels through both cytoplasmic and membrane-delimited pathways (Brown, A. M., and Birnbaumer, L. (1990) Annu. Rev. Physiol. 52, 197-213). The membrane pathway may involve either a direct interaction between G protein and ion channel or an indirect interaction involving a membrane-delimited second messenger. To distinguish between the two possibilities, we tested whether a purified G protein could interact with a purified channel protein in a defined system to produce changes in channel currents. We selected the alpha subunit of Gs and the dihydropyridine (DHP)-sensitive Ca2+ channel of skeletal muscle T-tubules, the DHP binding protein (DHPBP), because: 1) a membrane-delimited interaction between the two has been shown (Brown, A. M., and Birnbaumer, L. (1990) Annu. Rev. Physiol. 52, 197-213; Yatani, A., Imoto, Y., Codina, J., Hamilton, S. L., Brown, A. M., and Birnbaumer, L. (1988) J. Biol. Chem. 263, 9887-9895); and 2) at the present time, these Ca2+ channels are the only putative G protein channel effectors which, following purification, still retain channel function. We used a defined system in which purified components were studied by direct reconstitution in planar lipid bilayers. Just as we had found in crude skeletal muscle T-tubule membranes (Yatani, A., Imoto, Y., Codina, J., Hamilton, S. L., Brown, A. M., and Birnbaumer, L. (1988) J. Biol. Chem. 263, 9887-9895), alpha*s but not alpha*i-3 stimulated Ca2+ currents. However, in the reconstituted system, this probably represents a direct interaction between Gs alpha and Ca2+ channels. To establish whether the two proteins were physically associated in the native T-tubule membrane, we examined the ability of either endogenous G proteins or exogenous alpha*s to purify with detergent-solubilized DHPBP through a wheat germ agglutinin affinity column and a sucrose gradient. Small amounts of a labeled G protein were found to co-purify with DHPBP. In addition, partially purified DHPBP increased the sedimentation rate of purified alpha*s but not alpha*i-3. G proteins were immunoprecipitated with an antibody to the alpha 1 subunit of the DHPBP, and, in addition, both alpha s and the beta subunit of Gs were detected in Western blots of the partially purified DHPBP. The results suggest that Gs and Ca2+ channels are closely associated in the T-tubule plasma membrane, and we conclude that skeletal muscle Ca2+ channels are direct effectors for Gs."
https://openalex.org/W1581465426,"We identified a peptide fraction from the venom of the scorpion Buthotus hottentota that stimulated binding of [3H]ryanodine to ryanodine receptors of skeletal and cardiac sarcoplasmic reticulum and brain microsomes in a highly specific manner. Activity was concentrated in a peptide fraction of Mr 5,000-8,000. Assuming a single active peptide in this fraction, we estimated a dissociation constant of 20-30 nM for the interaction of the peptide with the ryanodine receptor. The whole venom and the purified fraction activated skeletal ryanodine receptor Ca2+ release channels incorporated into planar lipid bilayers. The venom produced a 10-fold increase in the mean open time and induced the appearance of a long lasting subconductance state not seen in controls. Changes were reversible and could be induced by the partially purified venom fraction. This novel scorpion venom should be helpful in establishing the role of ryanodine receptors in the initiation of intracellular Ca2+ release in striated muscle and in nonmuscle cells containing functional ryanodine receptors such as neurons and secretory cells."
https://openalex.org/W1599140686,"Pyrococcus furiosus ferredoxin contains a single [4Fe-4S] that exists in both S = 1/2 (20%) and S = 3/2 (80%) ground states in the reduced protein. We report here on the temperature-dependent potentiometric properties of the two spin forms, their stability, and on the structural features that differentiate them. The midpoint potential (Em) of the cluster in either spin state was determined at -365 mV (30 degrees C, pH 8.0). By rapidly freezing samples for EPR analyses, it was shown that the Em values of both spin states appear to change by -1.7 mV/degrees C over the range 20 degrees-80 degrees C, and by -6 mV/degrees C between 80 and 89 degrees C. The Em values and the relative amounts of the S = 1/2 and S = 3/2 forms of the cluster were unaffected by pH (6.8-10.5), even at 85 degrees C, and were unchanged by the presence of NaCl (1.0 M), sodium dodecyl sulfate (10%, w/v) or ethylene glycol (50%, v/v), even at 80 degrees C. The S = 1/2 form of the [4Fe-4S]+ cluster was found to exhibit a strongly coupled 1H ENDOR resonance (A = 22 MHz) that was exchangeable with the solvent. Such a large coupling has not been observed in any other iron-sulfur protein. Since a unique feature of this 4Fe-ferredoxin is that only 3 cysteinyl residues appear to be coordinated to the [4Fe-4S] cluster, the ENDOR data are consistent with an H2O molecule being a ligand to the unique Fe site. The S = 3/2 form of the [4Fe-4S]+ cluster exhibited a similar, strongly coupled 1H ENDOR resonance, but in this spin state it was not exchangeable with the solvent. This suggests that the [4Fe-4S]+ cluster exhibiting the S = 3/2, but not the S = 1/2 ground state, is shielded from the solvent, presumably by neighboring amino acid residues. In view of the pH dependence of the midpoint potential of the two spin states, the fourth ligand to the cluster and the source of the strongly coupled 1H ENDOR resonance is probably an OH- rather than H2O molecule."
https://openalex.org/W1496714497,"The regulatory subunit of cAMP-dependent protein kinase in yeast, encoded by the BCY1 gene, is known to be required under certain conditions such as growth on nonfermentable carbon sources and entry into stationary phase. We have identified novel isoforms of Bcy1 in cells under these conditions. The isoforms are distinguishable by their migration on one-dimensional sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE) and 2-dimensional nonequilibrium pH gradient gel electrophoresis. The isoforms observed by one-dimensional SDS-PAGE bind cAMP, as determined by [32P]8-azido-cAMP labeling (diagnostic of Bcy1 protein). Proteins isolated from cells grown to stationary phase in rich medium exhibit five antibody-reactive bands, by one-dimensional SDS-PAGE immunoblot analysis, with apparent molecular masses of 50, 52, 55, 59 and 61 kDa. Total Bcy1 protein increases at least 8-fold between exponential and stationary phase. Analysis of proteins from a variety of yeast mutants indicated that 1) many of the observed modifications of Bcy1 are dependent upon the presence of the Ser-145 phosphorylation site; 2) the appearance of the 59- and 61-kDa bands is dependent upon the presence of Yak1 kinase; and 3) Bcy1 protein is modified even in the absence of cAMP-dependent protein kinase catalytic subunits. Cells carrying the bcy1(ala145) allele exhibit non-wild type growth, indicating that these modifications may be functionally significant."
https://openalex.org/W1531065454,"gCap39 is an actin filament end-capping protein which has a threefold repeated domain structure similar to the N-terminal half of gelsolin. However, unlike gelsolin, gCap39 does not sever actin filaments and dissociates completely from filament ends after calcium removal. We have capitalized on these differences to explore the structural basis for actin filament capping, severing, and their regulation. Using truncated gCap39, generated by limited proteolysis or deletion mutagenesis, we found that actin filament capping requires multiple gCap domains, and almost the entire molecule is necessary for optimal activity. gCap39 domain I, like the equivalent domain in gelsolin, contains an actin monomer binding site. gCap39 domains II-III are, however, different from gelsolin in that they do not bind to the side of actin filaments. Since filament side binding is hypothesized to be the first step in severing, lack of side binding may explain why gCap39 does not sever. This is confirmed directly by swapping gCap39 domains II-III for the side-binding gelsolin domains to generate a chimera which severs actin filaments. The chimera is Ca2+ independent in actin filament severing and capping, although gCap39 domain I itself is regulated by Ca2+."
https://openalex.org/W2004993844,"The 17-amino acid peptide from chicken ovalbumin, Ova(323-339), was labeled at the amino terminus with fluorescein [FOva(323-339)] and near the carboxyl terminus with Texas Red [AcOva(323-338)KTR]. Fluorescence spectroscopy was carried out on resolved electrophoretic bands on nonreducing polyacrylamide gels derived from incubation mixtures containing major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class II molecules IAd and the FOva(323-339)- and AcOva(323-338)KTR-labeled peptides. Energy transfer between fluorescein and Texas Red was observed in the ""floppy"" alpha beta heterodimer band, but not in the ""compact"" alpha beta heterodimer band. Energy transfer was detected between the truncated peptides FOva(323-328)CONH2 and AcOva(331-338)KTR in both the compact alpha beta and floppy alpha beta gel bands. The energy-transfer data suggest that the two binding sites of floppy alpha beta arise from splitting apart a putative large, single binding site region in compact alpha beta."
https://openalex.org/W1577753916,"The effects of short wave ultraviolet (UV)-induced DNA lesions on the catalytic activity of Drosophila melanogaster topoisomerase II were investigated. The presence of these photoproducts impaired the enzyme's ability to relax negatively supercoiled pBR322 plasmid molecules. As determined by DNA photolyase-catalyzed photoreactivation experiments, enzyme inhibition was due to the presence of cyclobutane pyrimidine dimers in the DNA. When 10-20 cyclobutane dimers were present per plasmid, the initial velocity of topoisomerase II-catalyzed DNA relaxation was inhibited approximately 50%. Decreased relaxation activity correlated with an inhibition of the DNA strand passage step of the enzyme's catalytic cycle. In contrast, UV-induced photoproducts did not alter the prestrand passage DNA cleavage/religation equilibrium of topoisomerase II either in the absence or presence of antineoplastic agents. Results of the present study demonstrate that the repair of cyclobutane pyrimidine dimers is important for the efficient catalytic function of topoisomerase II."
https://openalex.org/W1596835235,"Anion exchange chromatography of reticulocyte lysates revealed that the ubiquitin cell-free system can be resolved into two essential fractions: unadsorbed material (Fraction I) that contains ubiquitin and a high salt eluate (Fraction II) that contains the conjugating enzymes and the conjugate-degrading protease. Many proteins with exposed NH2 termini are degraded in a ubiquitin-supplemented Fraction II. However, this partially purified and reconstituted system does not degrade N-alpha-acetylated proteins. These proteins are degraded in whole lysates in a ubiquitin-dependent manner (Mayer, A. Siegel, N. R., Schwartz, A. L., and Ciechanover, A. (1989) Science 244, 1480-1483). It appears that a protein factor which is specifically required for the degradation of N-alpha-acetylated proteins is removed or inactivated during the fractionation of the lysate. Here we report the purification and characterization of a novel protein that is required along with the protease for the degradation of ubiquitin conjugates of histone H2A, an N-alpha-acetylated protein. The protein is not required for the degradation of ubiquitin conjugates of proteins with free NH2 termini. The protein, which is found in crude Fraction I, was purified approximately 200-fold by (NH4)2SO4 precipitation, Sephadex G-100 gel-filtration chromatography, Mono Q anion exchange chromatography, and an additional Sephadex G-100 gel filtration chromatography step. The protein is removed from Fraction I during the purification of ubiquitin and has not been previously recognized since the majority of the protein substrates evaluated in the cell-free system have free NH2 termini. The protein has an apparent molecular mass of approximately 92 kDa. It is a homodimer that is composed of two identical 46-kDa subunits. Initial analysis of the mechanism of action of this protein revealed that it must interact with the conjugates in order to allow proteolysis to occur. We designated the protein Factor H (Factor Hedva)."
https://openalex.org/W1516851917,"Botulinum C2 toxin, a binary toxin which selectively ADP-ribosylates nonmuscle G-actin, was used to evaluate the role of cytoskeletal rearrangement in ligand-evoked signal transduction and secretory processes in human neutrophils (polymorphonuclear leukocyte). Preincubation with the combined toxin components reduced the basal F-actin content and nearly completely suppressed the actin assembly initiated by the peptide and lipid chemoattractants formyl-methionyl-leucyl-phenylalanine, platelet activating factor, and leukotriene B4. Superoxide production and elastase secretion were increased markedly under these conditions. Concomitantly, ligand-elicited phosphoinositide hydrolysis was augmented with particular increase in inositol monophosphate. This was paralleled by a severalfold amplification of diacylglycerol formation and sustained elevation of cytosolic calcium. The toxin-effected amplification of postreceptor events and secretory responses was most pronounced in response to formyl-methionyl-leucyl-phenylalanine greater than platelet activating factor greater than leukotriene B4. All metabolic and secretory effects in C2 toxin-pretreated cells were sensitive to pertussis toxin inhibition. In conjunction with the recent finding of unchanged formyl-methionyl-leucyl-phenylalanine receptor binding and dissociation dynamics under influence of C2 (Norgauer, J., Just, I., Aktories, K., and Sklar, L. A. (1989) J. Cell Biol. 109, 1133-1140), the present investigation suggests amplification of postreceptor events as a major mechanism underlying C2 toxin-related increase in polymorphonuclear leukocyte secretory responses. Cytoskeletal rearrangement, putatively linked to phosphoinositide turnover and calcium transients, thus appears to be operative in temporal and/or spatial limitation of chemoattractant-evoked cellular signal transduction."

https://openalex.org/W1550420936,"GRP78/BiP resides in the lumen of the endoplasmic reticulum (ER), a major site of Ca2+ sequestration and early protein processing. Agents, such as ionophore A23187, that mobilize sequestered ER Ca2+ suppress translational initiation within minutes and induce GRP78 within 1-3 h accompanied by development of translational tolerance to the inhibitor. Accommodation is prevented by actinomycin D and reduced by antisense oligonucleotides directed against GRP78 mRNA. In GH3 cells, optimal induction of GRP78 and translational accommodation depended on cAMP elevation and phorbol ester. GRP78 mRNA was induced 3-6-fold with A23187 alone as compared with 12-20-fold with ionophore plus cAMP-elevating agent and phorbol ester, but was not markedly induced without A23187. GRP78 gene transcription in nuclei isolated from A23187-treated cells was increased 2-4-fold by cAMP and phorbol ester. A nucleotide sequence homologous to the cAMP-responsive element consensus potentially exists in the promoter region of the GRP78 gene. GRP78 mRNA in ionophore-treated cells was largely associated with mono- and polysomal fractions rather than ribonuclear protein particles, a distribution different from actin and tubulin mRNAs. While polysomal content increased in cells undergoing translational recovery, cAMP and phorbol esters did not affect GRP78 mRNA stability. Translational accommodation in ionophore-treated GH3 cells is proposed to involve enhanced transcription of GRP78 mRNA promoted by cAMP/phorbol ester in conjunction with preferential polysomal loading of the message."

https://openalex.org/W1549386858,"A mutational analysis was used to identify structural domains that are important for exocytic transport and proteolytic cleavage of the mouse mammary tumor virus (MMTV) glycoprotein, which is expressed as a multidomain polyprotein. Rat HTC hepatoma cells were transfected with the MMTV glycoprotein gene driven by the constitutive Rous sarcoma virus promoter, with mutant genes encoding a series of polypeptide truncations or with a defective MMTV provirus containing a premature termination codon in the viral glycoprotein gene. Efficient proteolytic maturation and transport of MMTV glycoproteins to the cell surface or extracellular environment required the presence of the transmembrane domain but not the cytoplasmic tail. Two stable truncations retaining the hydrophobic region of the ectodomain in the absence of the transmembrane domain and cytoplasmic tail (trgp67 and trgp58) remained in endoglycosidase H sensitive and uncleaved forms. One of these truncations, trgp58, appeared to be tightly associated with intracellular membranes and strongly bound by heavy chain binding protein, whereas the other truncation, trgp67, was a soluble component of the lumen and persists intracellularly by a heavy chain binding protein-independent pathway. The truncated MMTV glycoprotein additionally lacking the hydrophobic region of the ectodomain was efficiently secreted. Taken together, our results demonstrate that the hydrophobic transmembrane domain of the MMTV glycoprotein is required for proper transport and proteolytic processing, whereas, in the absence of the transmembrane domain, the presence of a hydrophobic region of the ectodomain correlated with retention at an early step in the exocytic pathway."
