https://openalex.org/W1499300100,"Mammalian mitochondrial DNAs contain a conserved origin of light-strand replication that supports accurate initiation of DNA synthesis in vitro. This provides an opportunity to examine the sequence requirements for initiation through in vitro analysis of a series of deleted and mutagenized DNA templates. These assays use enzymes isolated from human mitochondria and single-stranded DNA templates containing deletions or substitutions in the known origin region. The data indicate that accurate and efficient light-strand replication in vitro requires the previously identified stem-loop structure located within a tRNA cluster. In addition, the template sequence 3'-GGCCG-5', located immediately adjacent to the stem, is necessary for efficient replication. This sequence, the complement of which encodes the 3' end of tRNACys, may be the site of transition from RNA primer synthesis to DNA synthesis. Surprisingly, substitutions within a region located in the loop of this origin do not reduce levels of replication."
https://openalex.org/W1955885340,"The neutral histidine-rich polypeptide (HRP) from human parotid secretion was isolated by ion-exchange and gel-filtration chromatography. The complete amino acid sequence determined by automated Edman degradation of the protein, tryptic and Staphylococcus aureus V8 protease peptides, and digestion with carboxypeptidase A is: (Formula: see text) where Pse represents phosphoserine. The polypeptide contains 38 residues and has Mr 4929. The charged amino acids predominate with 7 histidine, 4 arginine, 3 lysine, 3 aspartic acid, 3 glutamic acid residues, and 1 phosphoserine. Assuming minimal charge contributions from histidine and one negative charge from phosphoserine at pH 7, the net charge of HRP is balanced by an equal contribution of basic and acidic residues. Furthermore, the distribution of hydrophilic and hydrophobic residues along the polypeptide chain indicates that there is no structural polarity. The polypeptide lacks threonine, alanine, valine, cysteine, methionine, and isoleucine. HRP did not display sequence similarity with any protein sequence in the National Biomedical Research Foundation Data Bank. HRP is an active inhibitor of hydroxyapatite crystal growth from solutions supersaturated with respect to calcium phosphate salts and therefore must play a role in the stabilization of mineral-solute interactions in oral fluid. In addition, HRP is a potent inhibitor of Candida albicans germination and therefore may be a significant component of the antimicrobial host defense system in the oral cavity."
https://openalex.org/W1515063683,"Extracts of bovine neurointermediate pituitary secretory granules and frozen bovine neurointermediate pituitary contain multiple forms of peptidylglycine alpha-amidating monooxygenase (PAM) activity differing in apparent molecular weight and in charge. Metal chelate affinity chromatography, substrate affinity chromatography, and gel filtration resulted in the purification of two forms of amidation activity from frozen bovine neurointermediate pituitary: PAM-A, apparent molecular weight 54,000, was purified 7,000-fold and PAM-B, apparent molecular weight 38,000, was purified 21,000-fold. Enzyme activity of similar molecular weights was observed in the starting material. Purified PAM-A and PAM-B correspond to two of the three charge forms present in crude extracts, and both exhibited optimal activity at alkaline pH. Sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis of PAM-B revealed the presence of two bands with apparent molecular weights of 42,000 and 37,000; autoradiography of 125I-labeled PAM-B revealed only the same two bands, and 125I-labeled PAM-B co-eluted with enzyme activity during gel filtration. PAM-A was still heterogeneous based on sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. The properties of purified PAM-A and PAM-B were very similar to those of amidation activity in crude extracts: activity was reduced upon removal of molecular oxygen; activity was stimulated by the addition of CuSO4 and eliminated by the addition of diethyldithiocarbamate; activity was stimulated by the addition of ascorbate, with optimal levels of ascorbate increasing as the concentration of peptide substrate was increased. In the presence of 1.25 mM ascorbate, PAM-B exhibited a Km of 7.0 microM for D-Tyr-Val-Gly and a Vmax of 84 nmol/micrograms/h."

The isoelectric point was measured at pH 4.0 for Pf1 and at pH 4.2 for fd. Close agreement of experimental and calculated data was found, confirming the hypothesis that charged residues in the DNA are neutralized by oppositely charged residues of the coat proteins. Almost perfect consistence is reached when structural details of the viruses are included."
https://openalex.org/W1506667936,"The dihydrolipoyl transacetylase component, which serves as the structural core of mammalian pyruvate dehydrogenase complexes, is acetylated when treated with either pyruvate or with acetyl-CoA in the presence of NADH. Besides the dihydrolipoyl transacetylase component, we have found that another protein, referred to as protein X, is rapidly acetylated at thiol residues. Protein X remains fully bound to the transacetylase core under conditions that remove the pyruvate dehydrogenase and dihydrolipoyl dehydrogenase components. Mapping of 125I-tryptic peptides indicated that the transacetylase subunits and protein X are structurally distinct; however, under the same mapping conditions, there is considerable similarity in the positions of acetylated peptides derived from these subunits. Affinity-purified rabbit immunoglobulin G prepared against the dihydrolipoyl transacetylase core reacted exclusively with the transacetylase and with both its tryptic-derived inner domain and outer lipolyl-bearing domain. Those results further indicate that protein X is not derived from the transacetylase subunit Affinity-purified mouse antibody to protein X reacted selectively with large tryptic polypeptides derived from protein X and did not react with the inner domain of the transacetylase. However, the anti-protein X antibody did react with the intact transacetylase subunit, the lipoyl-bearing domain of the transacetylase, and weakly with the transsuccinylase component of the alpha-ketoglutarate dehydrogenase complex. This cross-reactivity reflected specificity of a portion of the polyclonal antibodies for a related structural region in the transacetylase and protein X (possibly a similar lipoyl-bearing region). Furthermore, a major portion of that polyclonal antibody was shown to react exclusively with protein X. Thus, protein X subunits differ substantially from transacetylase subunits but the two components have a region of structural similarity. We estimate that there are about 5 mol of protein X per mol of the kidney pyruvate dehydrogenase complex. Under a variety of conditions that result in a wide range of levels of acetylation of sites in the complex, about 1 acetyl group is incorporated into protein X per 10 acetyl groups incorporated into the transacetylase subunits per mol of complex. That ratio is close to the ratio of protein X subunits of transacetylase subunits in the complex, indicating that there are efficient mechanisms for acylation and deacylation of protein X."
https://openalex.org/W1496336749,"Previous studies demonstrated that palmitate and myristate are covalently linked to distinct sets of cellular proteins and that the linkages through which these fatty acids are attached to the polypeptide chains are different (Olson, E. N., Towler, D. A., and Glaser, L. (1985) J. Biol. Chem. 260, 3784-3790). In the present study, the kinetics and subcellular sites of acylation of proteins with palmitate and myristate were examined in the BC3H1 muscle cell line. Acylation with myristate was an extremely early modification that appeared to take place cotranslationally or shortly thereafter for a variety of soluble and membrane-bound proteins. In contrast, acylation of proteins with palmitate was a post-translational event that occurred exclusively on membrane proteins. To begin to understand the intracellular pathways that acyl proteins follow during their maturation, the degree of glycosylation, and the nature of the interaction of these proteins with membranes were examined. The majority of acyl proteins were tightly associated with membranes and could not be removed by conditions that release peripheral proteins from membranes. However, only a minor fraction of acylated proteins were N-glycosylated. These data suggest that the acyltransferases that attach palmitate and myristate to proteins are present in different subcellular locations and demonstrate that these fatty acids are attached to newly synthesized acyl proteins at different times during their maturation. The lack of carbohydrate on the majority of integral membrane acyl proteins suggests that these proteins may follow intracellular pathways that are different from those followed by cell surface glycoproteins."
https://openalex.org/W1599539035,"Previous studies on the lipopigment from the livers of sheep affected with ceroid lipofuscinosis showed that the disease does not involve a defect in lipid metabolism or abnormal lipid peroxidation and that most of the lipopigment was proteinaceous. In this study, lipopigment was isolated from liver, kidney, pancreas, and brain of affected sheep without the use of proteolytic enzymes. Lipopigment from all tissues was two-thirds protein. Modified silver staining after sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis showed a major band of Mr = 14,800, heterogeneous material between Mr = 5,000 and 9,000, and a major band of Mr = 3,500. These compounds did not stain for RNA or carbohydrate and were digested by a nuclease-free protease as expected for protein. They are not normal lysosomal proteins. Lipopigment levels of dolichol, ubiquinone, and cholesterol were consistent with the lipopigment being protein-enriched lysosome-derived cytosomes. The presence of the Mr = 3,500 proteins in whole affected tissue homogenates distinguished them from homogenates of normal tissues. It was concluded that low Mr proteins are specifically stored in ovine ceroid lipofuscinosis and that the ceroid lipofuscinoses may result from inherited defects in lysosomal protein catabolism."
https://openalex.org/W1642193049,"Bovine brain contains calmodulin-dependent cyclic nucleotide phosphodiesterase isozymes which are composed of two distinct subunits: Mr 60,000 and 63,000. The 60-kDa but not the 63-kDa subunit-containing isozyme can be phosphorylated by cAMP-dependent protein kinase resulting in decreased affinity of this subunit toward calmodulin (Sharma, R. K., and Wang, J. H. (1985) Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 82, 2603-2607). In contrast, purified 63-kDa subunit-containing isozyme has been found to be phosphorylated by a preparation of bovine brain calmodulin-binding proteins in the presence of Ca2+ and calmodulin. The phosphorylation resulted in the maximal incorporation of 2 mol of phosphate/mol of the phosphodiesterase subunit with a 50% decrease in the enzyme affinity toward calmodulin. At a constant calmodulin concentration of 6 nM, the phosphorylated isozyme required a higher concentration of Ca2+ for activation than the nonphosphorylated phosphodiesterase. The Ca2+ concentrations at 50% activation by calmodulin of the nonphosphorylated and phosphorylated isozymes were 1.1 and 1.9 microM, respectively. Phosphorylation can be reversed by the calmodulin-dependent phosphatase, calcineurin, but not by phosphoprotein phosphatase 1. The results suggest that the Ca2+ sensitivities of brain calmodulin-dependent cyclic nucleotide phosphodiesterase isozymes can be modulated by protein phosphorylation and dephosphorylation mechanisms in response to different second messengers."
https://openalex.org/W1545964569,"The receptor for the heat-stable enterotoxin (ST) from Escherichia coli was solubilized with Lubrol-PX from rat intestinal brush-border membranes and characterized. The binding kinetics and analog specificity of the solubilized receptor were virtually identical to those obtained with the membrane-bound receptor. Furthermore, the regulation of the receptor's affinity by cations was also maintained after solubilization, indicating a conservation of the toxin-binding site after removal of the receptor from its membrane environment. Gel filtration and sucrose density gradient sedimentation studies gave a Stokes radius of 5.5 nm and a sedimentation coefficient of 7.0 S for the solubilized receptor. The isoelectric point of the receptor was determined as 5.5 using Sephadex isoelectric focusing electrophoresis. In all of these separation techniques, the ST receptor showed a single peak of activity that was clearly separated from that of guanylate cyclase. When 125I-ST was cross-linked to brush-border membranes with disuccinimidyl suberate, the affinity-labeled receptor solubilized with 0.1% Lubrol-PX eluted at a similar position as the native receptor on gel filtration chromatography. Analysis of the affinity-labeled receptor by sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis in the presence of reducing agent and by autoradiography revealed the presence of three specifically labeled polypeptides with apparent molecular weights of 80,000, 68,000, and 60,000. These results suggest that the ST receptor is solubilized by Lubrol-PX in an active form with preservation of its regulation by cations. Also, the ST receptor is separable from particulate guanylate cyclase indicating that the receptor is coupled to the activation of guanylate cyclase by an as yet undefined mechanism. Three subunit peptides may constitute a binding region of the receptor."
https://openalex.org/W1587373255,"The enzyme previously considered as an isozyme (E4, ALDH IV) of human liver aldehyde dehydrogenase (NAD+) (EC 1.2.1.3) has been purified to homogeneity by the use of ion exchange chromatography on CM-Sephadex and affinity chromatography on Blue Sepharose CL-6B and 5'-AMP Sepharose 4B and identified as glutamic gamma-semialdehyde dehydrogenase, or more precisely 1-pyrroline-5-carboxylate dehydrogenase (EC 1.5.1.12). Glutamic gamma-semialdehyde dehydrogenase was never previously purified to homogeneity from any mammalian species. The homogeneous enzyme is seen on isoelectric focusing gels as two fine bands separated by 0.12 pH units: pI = 6.89 and 6.77. In addition, the enzyme also appears as two bands in gradient gels; however, in polyacrylamide gels containing sodium dodecyl sulfate the enzyme migrates as one band, indicating that its subunits are of identical size. Because the enzyme molecule is considerably smaller (Mr approximately 142,000-170,000) than that of aldehyde dehydrogenases (EC 1.2.1.3) (Greenfield, N. J., and Pietruszko, R. (1977) Biochim. Biophys. Acta 483, 35-45; Mr approximately 220,000) and its subunit weight is different (70,600 versus approximately 54,000 for E1 and E2 isozymes), the enzyme is not an isozyme of aldehyde dehydrogenase previously described. The Michaelis constants for glutamic gamma-semialdehyde dehydrogenase with acetaldehyde and propionaldehyde are in the millimolar range. Its substrate specificity within the straight chain aliphatic aldehyde series is essentially confined to that of acetaldehyde and propionaldehyde with butyraldehyde and longer chain length aldehydes being considerably less active. Other substrates include succinic, glutaric, and adipic semialdehydes in addition to glutamic gamma-semialdehyde. The reaction velocity with glutamic gamma-semialdehyde is at least an order of magnitude larger than with carboxylic acid semialdehydes. Aspartic beta-semialdehyde is not a substrate. The reaction catalyzed appears to be irreversible. Although NADP can be used, NAD is the preferred coenzyme. The enzyme also exhibits an unusual property of being subject to substrate inhibition by NAD."
https://openalex.org/W1518115945,"A major phosphopeptide labeled in vivo, was identified in nucleolar protein B23 (Mr/pI = 37,000/5.1) after tryptic digestion. This peptide was purified by high performance liquid chromatography using reverse-phase (C8 and C18) columns. The phosphopeptide contains 20 amino acids including 1 phosphoserine, 7 glutamic acids, and 4 aspartic acids. The amino acid sequence is: His-Leu-Val-Ala-Val-Glu-Glu-Asp-Ala-Glu-Ser(P)-Glu-Asp-Glu-Asp- Glu-Glu-Asp-Val-Lys. This amino acid sequence is similar to that of nucleolar phosphoprotein C23 (8 consecutive amino acids were identical), and to the regulatory subunit (RII) of cAMP-dependent protein kinase (7 consecutive amino acids were identical, which is phosphorylated by casein kinase II (Carmichael, D.F., Geahlen, R.L., Allen, S.M., and Krebs, E.G. (1982) J. Biol. Chem 257, 10440-10445). The regions near these phosphorylation sites are enriched with glutamic and aspartic acids, suggesting that this acidic amino acid cluster may be essential for kinase recognition."
https://openalex.org/W1571199640,"We report the first anisotropy decays of protein fluorescence obtained using a frequency-domain fluorometer. The ultraviolet light source (300 nm) was a ring dye laser equipped with an intracavity frequency doubler, pumped by an argon ion laser. The data, measured at modulation frequencies from 2 to 200 MHz, reveal the presence of subnanosecond motions (0.1-0.2 ns) of the single tryptophan residues in melittin and monellin. For melittin the data also indicate the presence of slower motions near 1 ns, which may be the result of concerted motions of several peptide units. Smaller amplitude motions, on a similar timescale, were observed for the single tryptophan residue in staphylococcal nuclease. We demonstrate using N-acetyl-L-tryptophanamide in water that the method of frequency-domain fluorometry is capable of measuring correlation times as short as 50 ps. This method can provide data for the direct comparison of measured anisotropy decays with those predicted from molecular dynamics calculations."
https://openalex.org/W1523027978,"Twenty-one soluble proteins, five tRNAs, and three protein-nucleic acid complexes were studied in a systematic manner with regard to their crystallization behavior from polyethylene glycol and ammonium sulfate solutions in the presence of 0 to 1.5% beta-octyl glucoside. Our observations suggest that this neutral detergent does influence in a very positive way the growth characteristics of the macromolecules included in this experiment. In general, more reproducible and rapid growth was noted with an increased number of large individual crystals at the expense of microcrystals. In several cases, new crystal forms were discovered. Selected x-ray diffraction analyses imply that crystals grown in the presence of beta-octyl glucoside diffract as well or better than those grown in its absence. In addition, a screen of two proteins grown in the presence of 14 different common detergents suggested that a general detergent effect may be beneficial for the growth of crystals of biological macromolecules."
https://openalex.org/W1528685016,"Accurate transcription by RNA polymerase II has previously been shown to require a HeLa cell fraction designated [AB] in addition to other components (Samuels, M., Fire, A., and Sharp, P. A. (1982) J. Biol. Chem. 257, 14419-14427). A factor which substituted for HeLa [AB] was identified in chromatographic fractions from calf thymus and was purified an estimated 9,000-fold or more. The final calf thymus [AB] fractions contained three polypeptide species with molecular weights of 19,600, 19,100, and 12,800, whose appearance correlated with the transcription factor enzymatic activity. The intact factor had a molecular weight of 25,600-35,000 based on gel filtration and sedimentation analysis and could be inactivated by treatment with high temperatures or with N-ethyl-maleimide. [AB] did not stimulate nonspecific nucleotide incorporation by pure RNA polymerase II, but it did interact with factor [DB] and promoter template DNA to form a functional intermediate preceding accurate initiation. The calf thymus factor thus was homologous to HeLa [AB] by both physical and functional criteria. In contrast to a previous suggestion that this factor has properties associated with actin the highly purified active fractions did not contain detectable actin."
https://openalex.org/W1580372330,"Normal human plasma alpha 2HS-glycoprotein has earlier been shown to be comprised of two polypeptide chains. Recently, the amino acid and carbohydrate sequences of the short chain were elucidated (Gejyo, F., Chang, J.-L., Burgi, W., Schmid, K., Offner, G. D., Troxler, R.F., van Halbeck, H., Dorland, L., Gerwig, G. J., and Vliegenthart, J.F.G. (1983) J. Biol. Chem. 258, 4966-4971). In the present study, the amino acid sequence of the long chain of this protein, designated A-chain, was determined and found to consist of 282 amino acid residues. Twenty-four amino acid doublets were found; the most abundant of these are Pro-Pro and Ala-Ala which each occur five times. Of particular interest is the presence of three Gly-X-Pro and one Gly-Pro-X sequences that are characteristic of the repeating sequences of collagens. Chou-Fasman evaluation of the secondary structure suggested that the A-chain contains 29% alpha-helix, 24% beta-pleated sheet, and 26% reverse turns and, thus, approximately 80% of the polypeptide chain may display ordered structure. Four glycosylation sites were identified. The two N-glycosidic oligosaccharides were found in the center region (residues 138 and 158), whereas the two O-glycosidic heterosaccharides, both linked to threonine (residues 238 and 252), occur within the carboxyl-terminal region. The N-glycans are linked to Asn residues in beta-turns, while the O-glycans are located in short random segments. Comparison of the sequence of the amino- and carboxyl-terminal 30 residues with protein sequences in a data bank demonstrated that the A-chain is not significantly related to any known proteins. However, the proline-rich carboxyl-terminal region of the A-chain displays some sequence similarity to collagens and the collagen-like domains of complement subcomponent C1q."
https://openalex.org/W1595399273,"Toxin B, a potent cytotoxin produced by Clostridium difficile, was purified to homogeneity from 6-day broth cultures of a toxigenic isolate. Cytotoxin was purified approximately 4000-fold by sequential ammonium sulfate precipitation, DEAE-Sepharose chromatography, and high performance liquid chromatography on a Mono Q anion-exchange column. The molecular weight of reduced purified toxin was 50,000 on sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, compared to 150,000 for unreduced toxin. Dose-response studies indicated that subpicogram concentrations of purified toxin caused rounding of approximately 20,000 IMR-90 fibroblasts. The phenomenon of cell rounding caused by toxin B was correlated with the ratio of globular to filamentous actin in fibroblasts as measured by two techniques. The toxin caused a significant increase in the ratio of globular to filamentous actin which was nearly completed prior to the onset of rounding. We conclude that cell rounding of fibroblasts exposed to toxin B is related to an increase in the ratio of globular to filamentous actin which is produced by small numbers of toxin molecules/cell."
https://openalex.org/W1596512712,"Abstract A series of blood group H antigens reacting with monoclonal antibody MBrl has been found in human blood group A and AB erythrocytes, but not in O or B erythrocytes. These H antigens are clearly different from the globo-H structure (Fuc alpha 1----2Gal beta 1----3GalNAc beta 1----3Gal alpha 1----4Gal beta 1----4Glc beta 1----1Cer), which was previously isolated from O erythrocytes and is also reactive with the MBrl antibody. The new series of H antigens associated with blood group A has been characterized as having TLC mobilities which approximately coincide with those of H2, H3, and H4 glycolipids. One of these A-associated H antigens, having a similar TLC mobility as the H2 glycolipid, was isolated from A erythrocytes and was characterized by 1H NMR spectroscopy, methylation analysis, and enzymatic degradation as having the structure shown below: (formula, see text). The structure represents a precursor of the repetitive A epitope attached to type 2 chain, previously called type 3 chain A (Clausen, H., Levery, S. B., Nudelman, E., Tsuchiya, S., and Hakomori, S. (1985) Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 82, 1199-1203). This A-associated H structure is hereby called type 3 chain H."
https://openalex.org/W1564327094,"A protein, previously designated thioltransferase (Askelof, P., Axelsson, K., Eriksson, S., and Mannervik, B. (1974) FEBS Lett. 38, 263-267) was purified to homogeneity as judged by sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and flatbed gel isoelectric focusing. The preparative procedure, a modification of that of Axelsson et al. (Axelsson, K., Eriksson, S., and Mannervik, B. (1978) Biochemistry 17, 2978-2984) and Hatakeyama et al. (Hatakeyama, M., Tanimoto, Y., and Mizoguchi, T. (1984) J. Biochem. (Tokyo) 95, 1811-1818) was faster and higher-yielding than the previous procedures. The purified enzyme has a molecular weight of 11,700 as determined by sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and a pI of 8.8. The amino acid composition of thioltransferase is reported, and it closely resembles that of calf thymus glutaredoxin. The optimal pH for this enzyme was 8.5 when S-sulfocysteine was used as a substrate. The plots of the activity of thioltransferase as a function of S-sulfocysteine and 2-hydroxyethyl disulfide concentrations showed sigmoidal relationships. The K0.5 for S-sulfocysteine was 0.6 mM. The enzyme was very sensitive to sulfhydryl alkylating reagents. Preincubation of the enzyme with disulfide compounds prevented the enzyme from inactivation by iodoacetamide but inhibited the thioltransferase activity in the absence of iodoacetamide. The results suggest that the active center of thioltransferase is cysteine dependent and that substrates may form mixed disulfides with the enzyme. Based on the iodoacetamide inactivation and disulfide protection of thioltransferase activity, a model for the catalytic mechanism of the thiol-disulfide oxidoreduction is proposed."
https://openalex.org/W2149204394,"The ceroid lipofuscinoses are inherited lysosomal diseases of children characterized by a fluorescent lipopigment stored in a variety of tissues. Defects in lipid metabolism or the control of lipid peroxidation have been postulated to explain their pathogenesis. In the present study, lipopigment was isolated from the liver of sheep affected with ceroid lipofuscinosis. It was 70% protein, the rest being mainly lipids. These were only one-sixth as fluorescent as total liver lipids, but contained a number of fluorophors. None were major components of the lipopigment or the postulated fluorescent product of lipid peroxidation. Lipopigment lipids included the lysosomal marker bis(monoacylglycero)phosphate that contained 42.9% linoleate and 16.5% linolenate. Lipopigment neutral lipids were dolichol, dolichyl esters, ubiquinone, free fatty acids, and cholesterol, indicative of a lysosomal origin of the lipopigment. Phosphatidylcholine, phosphatidylinositol, phosphatidylserine, and phosphatidylethanolamine were present in proportions and with fatty acid profiles typical of lysosomes. No differences were found between the lipids of total control and affected livers, nor the fatty acid profiles of their phosphatidylcholine, phosphatidylethanolamine, or triglycerides. It is concluded that ovine ceroid lipofuscinosis is not a lipidosis, nor does the lipopigment arise from the abnormal peroxidation of lipids. Strong similarities between the lipopigment and the age pigment lipofuscin were noted."
https://openalex.org/W1597814524,"Abstract Passive uptake of potassium acetate into the mitochondrial matrix can be induced by nigericin, a K+/H+ antiporter, or by A23187, a Mg2+/2H+ antiporter. The latter process is thought to reflect operation of the Mg2+-dependent, endogenous K+/H+ antiporter, but there is ambiguity with respect to the mechanism of K+ transport in this assay (Nakashima, R.A., and Garlid, K.D. (1982) J. Biol. Chem. 257, 9252-9254). Kinetic analysis of potassium acetate transport provides verification that Mg2+ depletion 1) unmasks the K+/H+ antiporter, 2) opens up an intrinsic anion uniporter, 3) has no effect on acetic acid transport, and 4) does not induce high K+ uniport conductance. Mg2+-dependent uptake of potassium acetate is thereby shown to be mediated specifically by operation of the endogenous K+/H+ antiporter, as previously proposed. An extension of this analysis confirms that N,N'-dicyclohexylcarbodiimide and quinine block potassium acetate uptake via specific action on the K+/H+ antiporter. These findings support those of a previous study (Martin, W.H., Beavis, A.D., and Garlid, K.D. (1984) J. Biol. Chem. 259, 2062-2065) in which binding of [14C]N,N'-dicyclohexylcarbodiimide to membrane proteins under selective conditions was used to identify an 82,000-dalton band as the protein responsible for K+/H+ antiport in mitochondria."
https://openalex.org/W1568637259,"Abstract Cytochalasin D strongly inhibits the faster components in the reactions of actin filament depolymerization and elongation in the presence of 10 mM Tris-Cl-, pH 7.8, 0.2 mM dithiothreitol, 1 mM MgCl2, 0.1 mM CaCl2, and 0.2 mM ATP or ADP. Assuming an exclusive and total capping of the barbed end by the drug, the kinetic parameters derived at saturation by cytochalasin D refer to the pointed end and are 10-15-fold lower than at the barbed end. In ATP, the critical concentration increases with cytochalasin D up to 12-fold its value when both ends are free; as a result of the lowering of the free energy of nucleation by cytochalasin D, short oligomers of F-actin exist just above and below the critical concentration. Cytochalasin D interacts strongly with the barbed ends independently of the ADP-G-actin concentration (K = 0.5 nM-1). In contrast, the affinity of cytochalasin D decreases cooperatively with increasing ATP-G-actin concentration. These data are equally well accounted for by two different models: either cytochalasin D binds very poorly to ATP-capped filament ends whose proportion increases with actin concentration, or cytochalasin D binds equally well to ATP-ends and ADP-ends and also binds to actin dimers in ATP but not in ADP. A linear actin concentration dependence of the rate of growth was found at the pointed end, consistent with the virtual absence of an ATP cap at that end."
https://openalex.org/W1513046262,"The novel A-associated H antigen (type 3 chain H), described in the accompanying paper (Clausen, H., Levery, S.B., Kannagi, R., and Hakomori, S. (1986) J. Biol. Chem. 261, 1380-1387), as well as globo-H were found to be present in greater quantity in A2 erythrocytes than in A1 erythrocytes. A1 erythrocytes contain the repetitive A epitope (type 3 chain A) (Clausen, H., Levery, S.B., Nudelman, E., Tsuchiya, S., and Hakomori, S. (1985) Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 82, 1199-1203), which is defined by A1-specific monoclonal antibody TH-1, in addition to globo-A. The ability of alpha-GalNAc transferase from A1 and A2 serum to catalyze the conversion of type 2 chain H, type 3 chain H, and globo-H to type 2 chain A, type 3 chain A, and globo-A, respectively, was compared. The conversion to type 3 chain A and globo-A occurred to a minimal degree in the presence of the A2 enzyme as compared with the A1 enzyme, particularly at low substrate concentration. Although a lower conversion from type 2 chain H to type 2 chain A was also observed in the presence of the A2 enzyme than in the presence of the A1 enzyme, the conversion of type 2 chain H to type 2 chain A was less restricted than the type 3 chain conversion catalyzed by the A2 enzyme, particularly at low substrate concentration. The conversion from globo-H to globo-A was essentially absent in the presence of the A2 enzyme. Since the expression of type 1 chain H in erythrocytes is dependent on secretor status, the distribution of type 3 chain H and globo-H in erythrocytes from secretors and non-secretors was compared. These antigens appeared to be present in the same quantity in erythrocytes of secretors and nonsecretors."

From chymotryptic digests of the hydroxylase carried out in the presence and absence of (6R)-tetrahydrobiopterin, several different enzyme species were isolated by high pressure gel filtration. One species (subunit Mr = 47,000) with unchanged hydroxylase activity was isolated from the chymotryptic digest in the presence of (6R)-tetrahydrobiopterin; it was derived from the native enzyme (Mr = 52,000) by cleavage of the COOH-terminal Mr = 5,000 portion of the native enzyme. In the absence of (6R)-tetrahydrobiopterin, another species (subunit Mr = 36,000) was isolated. In addition to modification at the COOH-terminal end of the molecule, this species also had lost a Mr = 11,000 fragment from the NH2-terminal end of the hydroxylase. The Mr = 11,000 fragment was shown to include the phosphorylation site of the enzyme. This Mr = 36,000 species was 30-fold more active than the native phenylalanine hydroxylase when assayed in the presence of tetrahydrobiopterin. These results suggest that the regulatory domain that inhibits hydroxylase activity in the basal state may be located at the NH2 terminus of the phenylalanine hydroxylase subunit."
https://openalex.org/W1552552486,"Polypeptide gp95 is a major glycoprotein present in preparations of isolated ciliary extensions from frog olfactory sensory neurons (Chen, Z., and Lancet, D. (1984) Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 81, 1859-1863). We report here that gp95 is distinct among the ciliary polypeptides in having several properties that make it a plausible receptor candidate: it is specific to olfactory cilia, it has the appropriate bilayer density, and it is a transmembrane protein. Polypeptide gp95 has a uniquely high content of complex type oligosaccharides compared to other ciliary glycoproteins, a property which is used for its partial purification and can also serve as a probe for functional identification. The present biochemical characterization of frog gp95 and of its putative homologs from other species may open the way to a future assignment of its role in chemosensory reception."
https://openalex.org/W1511510926,"The reaction of Old Yellow Enzyme (OYE) with pyridine nucleotides has been examined using steady state kinetics, rapid reaction kinetics, and equilibrium binding. alpha-NADPH, beta-NADPH, and the acid breakdown products of NADPH all bind to oxidized OYE with dissociation constants below 1 microM. These complexes produce characteristic red shifts in the absorption spectrum of OYE. A similar red shift which occurs after multiple turnovers of OYE with NADPH has been found to be due to an impurity in the NADPH preparation, possibly an acid breakdown product. Anions such as chloride, acetate, azide, and phenolates compete with the pyridine nucleotides for binding to a common site in oxidized OYE. Anaerobic reduction of OYE by NADPH proceeds via two intermediates to establish a readily reversible equilibrium. In contrast to most other NADPH-dependent enzymes, both alpha- and beta-NADPH are capable of reducing OYE, and alpha-NADPH is more effective. Using beta-[4(R)-2H]NADPH, a primary deuterium isotope effect was observed in the reduction reaction. Results from rapid reaction and steady state studies showed that reduction of OYE was rate limiting in turnover. Consistent with this, the turnover number with alpha-NADPH was significantly higher than that with beta-NADPH."

The assignments are based on distance connectivities of less than 4.5 A established from NOE effects between base and sugar protons on the same strand and occasionally between strands, as well as, coupling connectivities within the protons on each sugar ring. We observe the NOEs to exhibit directionality and are consistent with the d(G-G-A-A-T-T-C-C) duplex adopting a right-handed helix in solution. The relative magnitude of the NOEs between base and sugar H2‘ protons of the same and 5‘-adjacent sugars characterizes the AATT segment to the B-helix type in solution."
https://openalex.org/W1490723098,"A pulse-chase experiment was performed in embryonic rat myotube cultures to examine possible precursor-product relationships among the various molecular forms of acetylcholinesterase (AChE). AChE was labeled with paraoxon, a compound which diethylphosphorylates AChE at its active site. Diethylphosphorylated (labeled) AChE is inactive but can be reactivated by treatment with 1-methyl-2-hydroxyiminomethyl-pyridinium. Thus labeled enzyme could be followed as AChE that regained activity following treatment with 1-methyl-2-hydroxyiminomethylpyridium. To selectively label monomeric AChE (the hypothesized precursor form), cultures were treated with methanesulfonylfluoride which irreversibly inactivated more than 97% of total cellular AChE. Methylsulfonylfluoride was then washed from the cultures, and they were labeled with paraoxon during a 40-55-min recovery period. AChE appearing in the cultures during this recovery period is newly synthesized and consists almost entirely (92%) of the monomeric form. Immediately and 120-130 min after labeling, cultures were subjected to a sequential extraction procedure to separate globular from asymmetric forms. Individual forms were then separated by velocity sedimentation on sucrose gradients. In our first series of experiments, we observed a 55% decrease in labeled monomers during the chase, a 36% increase in labeled tetramers, and a 36% increase in labeled asymmetric forms. In a second series of experiments focused on individual asymmetric forms, we observed a 55% decrease in labeled monomers, a 58% increase in labeled tetramers, an overall increase of 81% in labeled asymmetric forms, and a 380% increase in labeled A12 AChE. These data provide the first uniequivocal proof that complex forms of AChE are assembled from active monomeric precursors."
https://openalex.org/W1487857339,"The role of gamma-carboxyglutamic acid in prothrombin has been examined using partially carboxylated variant prothrombins isolated from a person with a hereditary defect in vitamin K-dependent carboxylation. These species differ in gamma-carboxyglutamic acid content, distribution, and function, as monitored by metal binding properties, conformational transitions, phospholipid binding, and calcium-dependent coagulant activity (Borowski, M., Furie, B. C., Goldsmith, G. H., and Furie, B. (1985) J. Biol. Chem. 260, 9258-9264). The distribution of gamma-carboxyglutamic acids in the variant prothrombin species was determined by specific tritium incorporation into gamma-carboxyglutamic acid residues, thermal decarboxylation, and automated Edman degradation. gamma-Carboxyglutamic acid residues in the partially carboxylated prothrombins were identified by the assay of tritium in the resultant glutamic acid residues in the acarboxyprothrombins. The results indicate that variant prothrombins 1-3 are nearly homogeneous populations of partially carboxylated prothrombins. The ability of prothrombin to undergo a metal-induced conformational change and to bind to phospholipid vesicles correlated closely to the presence of a gamma-carboxyglutamic acid at residue 16. This residue is likely involved in the formation of a critical high affinity metal-binding site, possibly formed by Gla 16 and Gla 25 and/or Gla 26. A second high affinity metal-binding site, present in all of the variant prothrombin species, is defined, as an upper limit, by Gla 6, Gla 14, Gla 19, and Gla 20. This region is likely responsible for the interaction of certain of the conformation-specific antibodies to the metal-stabilized conformer of prothrombin."
https://openalex.org/W1498411345,"Monolayer cultures of bovine parathyroid cells or fresh gland slices were incubated with radioactive amino acids in order to study the formation and metabolism of parathormone (PTH). PTH, secretory protein I, and COOH-terminal fragments of PTH were all released into media within 30 min, most strongly in the first hour after synthesis. Peptides in tissue, cells, and media were separated using reverse-phase high performance liquid chromatography. In eluates of media, six radioactive peaks were prominent. The first four and the sixth were immunoreactive in a COOH-terminal specific PTH radioimmunoassay, but only the sixth was reactive in an NH2-terminal specific assay. Under conditions where recovery of PTH(1-34) was quantitative, gel filtration of media was used to show that no NH2-terminal fragments of PTH were secreted. Sequence analyses of secreted COOH-terminal peptides indicated that the NH2 termini of the first three peaks corresponded to residues 43, 37, and 34 of PTH. The fourth peak contained a mixture of two peptides with NH2 termini at residues 24 and 28 of PTH. The fifth could not be identified; the sixth was PTH. Cleavages at the 23-24 bond of PTH occurred within minutes of the formation of PTH itself, and the other peptides were formed more slowly. Mandatory cleavage of PTH at the 23-24 peptide bond would destroy the biological activity of the hormone on kidney and bone, a situation consistent with the possibility that intracellular PTH metabolism participates in secretory regulation. The results showed that different peptides were generated in parathyroid cells than were previously shown to be produced by cathepsin B or D. The results suggest that the proteolytic pathway which results in the secretion of PTH fragments is nonlysosomal in nature."
https://openalex.org/W1521708233,"Abstract To characterize the process by which glycolipids are shed from cell membranes, the cellular and supernatant glycolipids were compared from a variant of the mouse lymphoma L5178Y which had been selected for strong expression of the neutral glycolipid gangliotriaosylceramide (GgOse3Cer). This glycolipid was present in three forms which differed in their fatty acid composition. Whereas the major cell-associated form of GgOse3Cer contained C24 fatty acids, the predominant form shed into the culture supernatant contained C16 fatty acids. Ultracentrifugation of the culture medium yielded a pellet with a GgOse3Cer profile similar to that of the cells and a supernatant enriched in the C16 fatty acid form. Gel filtration of the culture medium revealed two GgOse3Cer-containing pools. The first was excluded from Sepharose CL-2B and had a GgOse3Cer profile similar to that of the cells, while the second migrated with proteins in the range of 25,000-500,000 daltons and was enriched in the C16 fatty acid form. These results suggest two forms in which glycolipids are released from cell membranes. The first is in a large complex, possibly a membrane vesicle, which retains the glycolipid profile of the membrane of intact cells while the second form appears to result from the preferential release of particular glycolipid components."
https://openalex.org/W1524148297,"Cytochrome P-450 (P-450C21), purified from bovine adrenocortical microsomes, was incorporated into the single bilayer liposomes of egg yolk phosphatidylcholine by gel filtration, using a high pressure liquid chromatography system. Interaction of the steroid substrates, 17 alpha-hydroxyprogesterone and progesterone, with P-450C21 in the liposomes was studied in the equilibrium state by measuring substrate-induced spectral change. The apparent dissociation constant of the P-450C21-substrate complex increased with phosphatidylcholine concentration in the system, showing the substrate to be partitioned between the aqueous and lipid phases. Partition coefficients, determined by equilibrium dialysis and the Hummel-Dreyer method, were 3500 for progesterone and 2000 for 17 alpha-hydroxyprogesterone at 25 degrees C. The binding process of the substrates to P-450C21 in the liposomes and their dissociation were measured by a stopped flow method. The apparent rate of substrate binding to P-450C21 in the liposomes was not effected by substrate partitioning, indicating partitioning to occur much more quickly than substrate binding to P-450C21. Absorption changes observed in the stopped flow experiments were analyzed at a rapid equilibrium of partitioning. Based on these results, the substrate binding site of P-450C21 was concluded to face the lipid phase of the liposome membranes."

The oligosaccharide fraction thus obtained was separated into four acidic fractions by paper electrophoresis. The four acidic fractions were confirmed to be mixtures of mono-, di-, tri-, and tetrasialyloligosaccharides. Both N-acetyl- and N-glycolylneuraminic acids were found as sialic acids of interphotoreceptor retinol-binding protein. The monosialylated oligosaccharide fraction, which accounted for 40 molar per cent of the total oligosaccharides liberated, was a mixture of the following hybrid-type oligosaccharides: (Formula: see text) This is the first time that fucosylated hybrid-type oligosaccharides have been found in any glycoprotein.

Combined with NMR spectroscopy of the intact structure and degradative studies the structure was shown to be -O3SO----3Galp beta 1----3GalNAcp beta 1----4Galp beta 1----4Glcp beta 1----1Cer. The sulfoglycolipid was enriched in epithelial cells of mouse small intestine where it constituted at least 90% of the acidic glycolipids and 4-8 mol% of the total glycosphingolipids."

One of these monoclonal antibodies, FR-1, inhibited in vitro binding of 125I-HMG-1 to chromatin isolated from FL cells. When 125I-HMG-1 was co-introduced with antibody FR-1 by red cell-mediated microinjection, antibody FR-1 did not prevent the accumulation of 125I-HMG-1 in the nucleus. When 125I-antibody FR-1 or fluorescein isothiocyanate antibody FR-1 was introduced into the cytoplasm of FL cells, most of the antibody did not accumulate in the nucleus. But when 125I- or fluorescein isothiocyanate antibody FR-1 was co-introduced with HMG-1 into the cytoplasm of FL cells, it did migrate into the nucleus."
https://openalex.org/W1600993901,"Abstract In order to investigate the physicochemical properties of the N-formyl peptide receptor of human neutrophils, the receptor was specifically and covalently labeled with an iodinated, photoactivatable derivative of the chemotactic hexapeptide, N-formyl-norleucylleucyl- phenylalanyl-norleucyl-[125I]iodotyrosyl-N epsilon-(6- (4'-azido-2'-nitrophenylamino) hexanoyl)-lysine. After labeling isolated neutrophil membranes, the receptor was extracted with Triton X-100, digitonin, or octyl glucoside and subjected to gel filtration on a calibrated Ultrogel AcA 34 column. The Triton X-100- and digitonin-extracted receptor eluted as single molecular species, with Stokes radii of 40 and 33 A, respectively. This material was subjected to further physicochemical analysis. When octyl glucoside-extracted material was gel-filtered, a second peak containing specifically labeled material eluted in the void volume. Subsequent sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacryl-amide amide gel electrophoresis analysis indicated that this species was the result of disulfide bonded aggregates containing the monomeric species. Sedimentation equilibrium analysis was carried out in H2O and D2O/H2O mixtures, yielding an apparent molecular mass of 63,000 daltons for both Triton X-100- and digitonin-extracted receptor. This agrees closely with the reduced sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoretic value of 50,000-60,000 daltons, indicating that the receptor extracted from unstimulated membranes is monomeric in these detergents. From the sedimentation equilibrium data, the partial specific volume (v) and frictional ratio (f/f0) were calculated. The v is high in both Triton X-100 (0.880) and digitonin (0.829), indicating that the receptor may be associated with tightly bound endogenous lipid or that it is a hydrophobic membrane protein. This latter likelihood is further supported by the quantitative extraction of receptor into Triton X-114 by a phase-separation method. The frictional ratio of 1.1-1.3 is consistent with an elongated globular protein having an axial ratio of approximately 3:1. This in conjunction with the Stokes radius of 40 A would indicate that the receptor is capable of spanning the 35-40-A nonpolar center of the lipid bilayer. The state of the receptor in situ is discussed."
https://openalex.org/W1575315618,"We conducted solution hybridization and Northern blot experiments utilizing synthetic 18'-mer oligodeoxyribonucleotides complementary to two major rat hepatic phenobarbital-inducible cytochrome P-450s, P-450b and P-450e, to assess their mRNA expression during rat development. At all ages studied, with one exception (i.e. in day 22 neonates), P-450b mRNA was not detected in control animals. However, traces of P-450e message were observed in control animals on day 22 and persisted to adulthood. Phenobarbital pretreatment caused marked increases in hepatic mRNA for both P-450s as early as 22 days after conception. No increases were observed in RNA isolated from phenobarbital-pretreated day 10 or 19 rats. In general, the inducible levels of P-450b and P-450e mRNA increased as a function of age. The age-dependent increase in responsiveness to phenobarbital was associated with an age-dependent decrease in the ratio of P-450b to P-450e mRNA levels. The levels of P-450b/P-450e varied from a ratio of 19 at day 22 of development to a ratio of 5 at day 62 of development. Maximal levels of phenobarbital-induced hepatic RNA for both isozymes occurred 24 days after birth (day 46 of development), at which time P-450b and P-450e mRNAs accumulated to levels 2.4- and 1.8-fold greater, respectively, than levels found in comparably induced adult rat liver. Northern blot analyses indicated that the major mRNA species hybridizing to either the P-450b or P-450e oligomers in all age groups studied was approximately 1.8 kilobases."
https://openalex.org/W1673892247,"Several strains of Staphylococcus aureus secrete a protein, staphylocoagulase, that binds stoichiometrically to human prothrombin, resulting in a coagulant complex designated staphylothrombin. In the present study, staphylocoagulase was digested with alpha-chymotrypsin and the resulting fragments were isolated by gel filtration. One fragment (Mr 43,000) exhibited a high affinity for human prothrombin (Kd = 1.7 X 10(-9) M), which is comparable to the affinity observed using intact staphylocoagulase (Kd = 4.6 X 10(-10) M). A complex of the Mr 43,000 fragment and prothrombin possessed both clotting and amidase activity essentially identical to that observed in a complex of intact staphylocoagulase and prothrombin. A second fragment (Mr 30,000) exhibited weaker affinity for prothrombin (Kd = 1.2 X 10(-7) M). While clotting activity was not observed with a complex of this fragment and prothrombin, it nonetheless possessed a weak amidase activity. A third fragment (Mr 20,000) was found to bind to prothrombin, but the resultant complex did not exhibit clotting or amidase activity. Amino-terminal sequence analyses of these staphylocoagulase fragments revealed that the Mr 43,000 fragment constitutes the amino-terminal portion of staphylocoagulase and also contains the Mr 30,000 and 20,000 fragments. Moreover, the amino-terminal sequence of the Mr 20,000 fragment was identical to that observed for the Mr 30,000 fragment. From these results, we conclude that the functional region of staphylocoagulase for binding and activation of human prothrombin is localized in the amino-terminal region of the intact bacterial protein."

This phosphorylation can occur when the intracellular transport is inhibited by carbonyl cyanide m-chlorophenylhydrazone or when the attachment of asparagine-linked oligosaccharides is prevented by tunicamycin. Serine and glycosaminoglycan chains were identified as phosphorylation sites of secreted proteodermatan sulfate.

Based on the results of 500-MHz 1H NMR spectroscopy, in conjunction with sugar analysis and immunological assays, we propose the following structures for these oligosaccharides.

https://openalex.org/W1546856423,"When cells with surface-bound diphtheria toxin were exposed to pH 4.5, the toxin became shielded against lactoperoxidase-catalyzed radioiodination, indicating that the toxin was inserted into the membrane. Cells thus treated had strongly reduced ability to take up 36Cl-, 35SO4(2-), and [14C]SCN-. The reduction of chloride uptake was strongest at neutral pH, whereas that of sulfate was strongest at acidic pH. Lineweaver-Burk plots indicated that the toxin treatment reduced the Jmax but not the Km for the anions. The toxin also inhibited the NaCl-stimulated efflux of 35SO4(2-), indicating that the toxin inhibits the antiporter. No inhibition was found when toxin-treated cells were not exposed to low pH, whereas exposure to pH 4.5 for 20 s induced close to maximal inhibition. Half-maximal inhibition was obtained after exposure to pH 5.4. The concentration of diphtheria toxin required to obtain maximal inhibition (0.3 micrograms/ml) was sufficient to ensure close to maximal toxin binding to the cells. Even in ATP-depleted cells and in the absence of permeant anions, low pH induced inhibition of anion antiport in toxin-treated Vero cells. There was no measurable inhibition of anion antiport in cells with little or no ability to bind the toxin."
https://openalex.org/W1577941007,"Differential detergent gel electrophoresis conditions are described which enable the accurate quantitation of radiolabel incorporated into each of the closely migrating, constituent polypeptides of chicken fibrinogen: glycosylated and nonglycosylated A alpha, B beta, gamma', and gamma. These methods were applied to analysis of fibrinogen synthesis by monolayer cultures of chick embryo hepatocytes to determine whether the cells coordinate biosynthesis of the fibrinogen subunits under nonstimulated or basal conditions (i.e. in the absence of hormones) and in the presence of serum, which is a potent stimulator of fibrinogen production. Since secretion of the subunits apparently depends on their oligomeric assembly into the general structure (A alpha, B beta, gamma)2, it was thought that their synthesis might be stoichiometric. Incorporation of [35S]methionine into the subunit chains was determined for both cellular and secreted fibrinogen, immunoprecipitated from pulse-labeled and continuously labeled cultures. Molar ratios of subunit synthesis and the degree of serum-induced stimulation for each subunit were calculated. Specific subunit mRNA levels were also evaluated with a cell-free translation assay as well as microinjection of RNA into Xenopus oocytes. The results indicate, to the contrary, that in hormone-deprived hepatocytes there is a deficiency in A alpha chain synthesis, correlating with reduced A alpha-specific mRNA levels, which leads to hepatocellular degradation of surplus B beta and gamma chains. Addition of serum to the cellular environment, while increasing rates of subunit synthesis, also corrects the deficiency in A alpha chain synthesis, thereby restoring a measure of balance and preventing much of the degradation. The outcome of this serum-induced enhancement and coordination of fibrinogen subunit gene expression is a dramatic (more than 20-fold) stimulation of fibrinogen secretion."
https://openalex.org/W1494101678,"The effects of estrogen on liver gene expression in Xenopus laevis were examined using a nuclear transcription run-on assay. Vitellogenin transcription was detected 2 h after a single dose of estradiol and reached a maximum on day 4. By 12 days after hormone treatment vitellogenin transcription declined to low levels. Within 3 h after estrogen, total transcriptional activity increased 9-fold relative to control values, reaching a maximum level of 40-fold by 12 h. Total transcription remained elevated throughout the following 12-day time course. These data indicate that changes in vitellogenin transcription and total nuclear transcription are uncoupled. Steady-state levels of vitellogenin mRNA demonstrated a close correlation with the level of vitellogenin gene transcription at all time points. In another series of experiments, animals treated repeatedly with estrogen demonstrated an elevated steady-state level of vitellogenin transcription, an elevated steady-state level of vitellogenin mRNA, and a constant elevated level of total nuclear transcriptional activity. Neither hormonal treatment regimen had an effect on the transcription of actin or induced the embryonic gene DG42. Finally, the increase in total transcriptional activity is associated with increased activities of RNA polymerase I and/or III in addition to stimulation of RNA polymerase II activity."
https://openalex.org/W1497518126,"The regulation by glucocorticoids of phosphate transport in primary cultured chick renal cells was examined. Dexamethasone inhibited the Na+-dependent phosphate uptake system. Na+-independent phosphate uptake and Na+-dependent uptakes of alpha-methylglucoside and L-proline were unaffected. The mineralocorticoid aldosterone did not alter phosphate uptake. The inhibition of Na+-dependent phosphate uptake by dexamethasone was concentration-dependent, exhibited an induction period, was blocked by inhibitors of RNA and protein synthesis, and was rapidly reversed when the steroid was removed. Following reversal, the cells could respond a second time to the glucocorticoid. However, this time the response was rapid, could be evoked at least for 24 h after glucocorticoid withdrawal, and might be prevented by actinomycin D and cycloheximide. These findings demonstrate that glucocorticoids act on renal cells to modulate phosphate transport and suggest that the renal cell system provides an attractive model to examine the mechanism by which glucocorticoids control gene expression and regulate plasma membrane transport function."
https://openalex.org/W1512970527,"We have isolated a non-muscle myosin heavy chain gene from Acanthamoeba castellanii using as a heterologous probe a sarcomeric myosin heavy chain gene from Caenorhabditis elegans. The amoeba genomic clone has been tentatively identified as containing a myosin II heavy chain gene based on hybridization to a 5300-nucleotide RNA species, hybrid selection of a mRNA encoding a 185-kDa polypeptide, specific immunoprecipitation of this polypeptide with antiserum to myosin II, and an exact match between the DNA sequence and a carboxyl-terminal myosin II peptide previously sequenced by protein chemical methods (Cote, G.P., Robinson, E.A., Appella, E., and Korn, E. D. (1984) J. Biol. Chem. 259, 12781-12787). We also sequenced a region of the gene whose deduced amino acid sequence shows strong homology with that region of muscle myosins which is thought to be involved in nucleotide binding. These results indicate that the amoeba genomic clone contains at least 90% of the coding information for the 185-kDa heavy chain polypeptide and that the bulk of the gene contains very little intron DNA. Genomic blots of amoeba DNA probed with a portion of this myosin gene indicate the presence of additional highly related sequences within the amoeba genome."
https://openalex.org/W1548518713,"In sodium-free buffer of low ionic strength, the uptake of chloride and sulfate in Vero cells was found to occur mainly by antiport which was very sensitive to inhibition by 4-acetamido-4'-isothiocyanostilbene-2,2'-disulfonic acid. Efflux of anions from the cells appeared to energize the uptake. While the uptake of Cl- occurred over a wide pH range, that of SO4(2-) showed a clear maximum at pH 6-7. The rate of efflux of 36Cl- and 35SO4(2-) was strongly increased by the presence of permeant anions in the efflux buffer. Preincubation of the cells at slightly alkaline pH strongly increased the rate of C1- efflux into buffers nominally free of permeant anions, as well as the efflux by exchange. This increase did not occur if the cells were depleted for ATP during the preincubation. Depolarization of the cells reduced the rate of efflux into buffers without permeant anions, indicating that the efflux is at least partly due to net, electrogenic, anion transport. The efflux by antiport was not affected by manipulations of the membrane potential, indicating electroneutral exchange. The uptake and efflux were increased to the same extent with increasing temperature, the activation energies were Ea = 25 kcal/mol of Cl- and Ea = 12 kcal/mol of SO4(2-). Similar anion antiport appears to occur in L, baby hamster kidney, and HeLa S3 cells."
https://openalex.org/W1523295801,"Chicken erythrocyte tubulin containing a unique beta tubulin variant polymerizes with greater efficiency (lower critical concentration) but at a slower rate than chicken brain tubulin. In a previous study we demonstrated that the low net rate of assembly is partly due to the presence of large oligomers and rings which reduce the initial rate of subunit elongation on microtubule seeds (Murphy, D.B., and Wallis, K.T. (1985) J. Biol. Chem. 260, 12293-12301). In this study we show that erythrocyte tubulin oligomers also retard the rate of microtubule nucleation and the net rate of self-assembly. The inhibitory effect is most likely to be due to the increased stability of erythrocyte tubulin oligomers, including a novel polymer of coiled rings that forms during the rapid phase of microtubule polymerization. The slow rate of dissociation of rings and coils into dimers and small oligomers appears to limit both the nucleation and elongation steps in the self-assembly of erythrocyte microtubules."

Acute administration of 0.1 microM glucagon was accompanied by disappearance of the D- and I-bands and appearance of two additional forms (P- and A-bands, respectively). These latter two forms were demonstrated to be phosphorylated forms of the subunit. A fifth isoelectric form of the pyruvate kinase subunit (B-band) was identified by immunolocation; however, incorporation of radioisotope into this band was low. Chronic administration of glucagon or dexamethasone had no significant influence on the molecular properties of pyruvate kinase. However, novel observations concerning the influence of glucose and ethanol on the phosphorylation state of the enzyme were made. When hepatocytes were maintained at 5.5 mM glucose for 24-48 h, the activity ratio for pyruvate kinase decreased from 0.65 to 0.40 and the enzyme became partially phosphorylated. Raising the glucose concentration to 28 mM prevented or rapidly reversed the phosphorylation state of the enzyme. Administration of low concentrations of ethanol (1-20 mM) caused a decline in the activity ratio of pyruvate kinase in the presence of both 5.5 and 28 mM glucose. These latter observations concerning the influence of glucose and ethanol are the first demonstrating that nutrients or metabolites alter the phosphorylation state of the enzyme in the absence of hormonal stimuli."

Serine-82 becomes the pyruvate residue at the NH2 terminus of the alpha chain (Recsei, P.A., Huynh, Q. K., and Snell, E.E. (1983) Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 80, 973-977). The unusual reactivity of this particular -Ser-Ser- bond is demonstrated by its sensitivity to 1 M hydroxylamine, which cleaves the native proenzyme under mild conditions (pH 8.0, 37 degrees C) to yield a modified beta chain with serine hydroxamate at the COOH terminus (Ser-81) and a modified alpha chain containing serine (Ser-82 of the proenzyme) rather than pyruvate at the NH2 terminus. Neither an -Asn-Gly- bond nor other -Ser-Ser- bonds in the proenzyme were cleaved under these conditions. The reaction also did not occur with the denatured enzyme or with model peptides, indicating that the enhanced reactivity is a result of the particular conformation at this position in the native protein. The reaction with the native proenzyme proceeded optimally at pH 7.5-8.0 with a half-time (30 min) substantially less than that (3.5-4.5 h) required for the activation reaction and was not increased in rate by addition of K+. Correspondingly, preincubation of the proenzyme at pH 8.0 in the absence of both hydroxylamine and K+ modestly increased the rate of activation when K+ was subsequently added. Although these findings do not exclude other mechanisms, they are all consistent with and most easily explained by rearrangement of the pi chain to form an internal ester intermediate prior to the beta-elimination that occurs during activation to yield the alpha and beta chains of the mature enzyme."
https://openalex.org/W1609762995,"Abstract Heme-linked ionizations of the acidic and basic isoenzymes of ferrous horseradish peroxidase influence both the Fe-histidine stretching mode and the oxidation-state marker line. First, Raman difference spectroscopy of horseradish peroxidase confirms earlier work showing that v(Fe-His) undergoes a transition in frequency with a pK that is characteristic of the enzyme's functional properties. The Fe-histidine mode shifts by about 2.5-3.0 cm-1 for horseradish peroxidase C and by about 6 cm-1 for the acidic isoenzyme. Further, we find that the oxidation-state marker line v4 also exhibits a transition with the same pK. For horseradish peroxidase C the shift in v4 is 0.4 cm-1 and the pK is 7.1 +/- .5, in good agreement with the pK found by other techniques. Shifts in these two Raman lines are correlated for the pK 7.1 transition and attain their highest frequency at low pH. The correlation is in marked contrast with R/T shifts in hemoglobins for which delta v(Fe-His) and delta v4 are also linearly related but shift in opposite directions. The shift in v4 suggests a mechanism for pH control of catalytic function based on ring pi-charge density effects on the energy of charge-depleted high oxidation-state intermediates. A second transition in v4 (delta v4 = 2.6 cm-1) with a pK of 10.0 is interpreted in terms of a change in ligation and spin state."
https://openalex.org/W1514515159,"The hemoglobin of the marine annelid Glycera dibranchiata possesses several unique features: the hemoglobin consists of multiple monomeric and polymeric components, quaternary structure is lacking, the distal histidine is replaced by leucine in at least one monomeric constituent, and 4) the protein exhibits extremely rapid ligand binding kinetics. The effect of these structural modifications on the ligand binding process has been evaluated using resonance Raman spectroscopy to examine the vibrational modes of the porphyrin macrocycle in deoxy and carbonmonoxy equilibrium species of hemoglobin G. dibranchiata in both the unseparated monomeric and polymeric forms and in a single monomeric component designated Fraction II. Significant differences relative to hemoglobin were found in porphyrin pi electron density, vinyl environment, low frequency vibrational modes, and, in particular, the Fe-proximal histidine stretching mode. Spectra of the deoxy heme transients generated within 10 ns of ligand photolysis have also been examined. These clearly indicate large differences in the heme pocket dynamics subsequent to CO photolysis in G. dibranchiata hemoglobins relative to other hemoglobins. The significance of these results in terms of the kinetics and thermodynamics of ligand binding is discussed."
