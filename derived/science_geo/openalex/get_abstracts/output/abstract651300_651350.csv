A promising drug target is the viral main protease M pro , which plays a key role in viral replication and transcription. Dai et al. designed two inhibitors, 11a and 11b, based on analyzing the structure of the M pro active site. Both strongly inhibited the activity of M pro and showed good antiviral activity in cell culture. Compound 11a had better pharmacokinetic properties and low toxicity when tested in mice and dogs, suggesting that this compound is a promising drug candidate. Science , this issue p. 1331"
https://openalex.org/W3015411337,"Two-dimensional materials and their heterostructures constitute a promising platform to study correlated electronic states, as well as the many-body physics of excitons. Transport measurements on twisted graphene bilayers have revealed a plethora of intertwined electronic phases, including Mott insulators, strange metals and superconductors1–5. However, signatures of such strong electronic correlations in optical spectroscopy have hitherto remained unexplored. Here we present experiments showing how excitons that are dynamically screened by itinerant electrons to form exciton-polarons6,7 can be used as a spectroscopic tool to investigate interaction-induced incompressible states of electrons. We study a molybdenum diselenide/hexagonal boron nitride/molybdenum diselenide heterostructure that exhibits a long-period moiré superlattice, as evidenced by coherent hole-tunnelling-mediated avoided crossings of an intralayer exciton with three interlayer exciton resonances separated by about five millielectronvolts. For electron densities corresponding to half-filling of the lowest moiré subband, we observe strong layer pseudospin paramagnetism, demonstrated by an abrupt transfer of all the (roughly 1,500) electrons from one molybdenum diselenide layer to the other on application of a small perpendicular electric field. Remarkably, the electronic state at half-filling of each molybdenum diselenide layer is resilient towards charge redistribution by the applied electric field, demonstrating an incompressible Mott-like state of electrons. Our experiments demonstrate that optical spectroscopy provides a powerful tool for investigating strongly correlated electron physics in the bulk and paves the way for investigating Bose–Fermi mixtures of degenerate electrons and dipolar excitons. Optical spectroscopy is used to probe correlated electronic states in a moiré heterostructure, showing many-body effects such as strong layer paramagnetism and an incompressible Mott-like state of electrons."
https://openalex.org/W3014730061,"The initiation of an intestinal tumour is a probabilistic process that depends on the competition between mutant and normal epithelial stem cells in crypts1. Intestinal stem cells are closely associated with a diverse but poorly characterized network of mesenchymal cell types2,3. However, whether the physiological mesenchymal microenvironment of mutant stem cells affects tumour initiation remains unknown. Here we provide in vivo evidence that the mesenchymal niche controls tumour initiation in trans. By characterizing the heterogeneity of the intestinal mesenchyme using single-cell RNA-sequencing analysis, we identified a population of rare pericryptal Ptgs2-expressing fibroblasts that constitutively process arachidonic acid into highly labile prostaglandin E2 (PGE2). Specific ablation of Ptgs2 in fibroblasts was sufficient to prevent tumour initiation in two different models of sporadic, autochthonous tumorigenesis. Mechanistically, single-cell RNA-sequencing analyses of a mesenchymal niche model showed that fibroblast-derived PGE2 drives the expansion οf a population of Sca-1+ reserve-like stem cells. These express a strong regenerative/tumorigenic program, driven by the Hippo pathway effector Yap. In vivo, Yap is indispensable for Sca-1+ cell expansion and early tumour initiation and displays a nuclear localization in both mouse and human adenomas. Using organoid experiments, we identified a molecular mechanism whereby PGE2 promotes Yap dephosphorylation, nuclear translocation and transcriptional activity by signalling through the receptor Ptger4. Epithelial-specific ablation of Ptger4 misdirected the regenerative reprogramming of stem cells and prevented Sca-1+ cell expansion and sporadic tumour initiation in mutant mice, thereby demonstrating the robust paracrine control of tumour-initiating stem cells by PGE2-Ptger4. Analyses of patient-derived organoids established that PGE2-PTGER4 also regulates stem-cell function in humans. Our study demonstrates that initiation of colorectal cancer is orchestrated by the mesenchymal niche and reveals a mechanism by which rare pericryptal Ptgs2-expressing fibroblasts exert paracrine control over tumour-initiating stem cells via the druggable PGE2-Ptger4-Yap signalling axis."

https://openalex.org/W2955244474,"Efforts to make research results open and reproducible are increasingly reflected by journal policies encouraging or mandating authors to provide data availability statements. As a consequence of this, there has been a strong uptake of data availability statements in recent literature. Nevertheless, it is still unclear what proportion of these statements actually contain well-formed links to data, for example via a URL or permanent identifier, and if there is an added value in providing such links. We consider 531,889 journal articles published by PLOS and BMC, develop an automatic system for labelling their data availability statements according to four categories based on their content and the type of data availability they display, and finally analyze the citation advantage of different statement categories via regression. We find that, following mandated publisher policies, data availability statements become very common. In 2018 93.7% of 21,793 PLOS articles and 88.2% of 31,956 BMC articles had data availability statements. Data availability statements containing a link to data in a repository -- rather than being available on request or included as supporting information files -- are a fraction of the total. In 2017 and 2018, 20.8% of PLOS publications and 12.2% of BMC publications provided DAS containing a link to data in a repository. We also find an association between articles that include statements that link to data in a repository and up to 25.36% ($\pm$~1.07%) higher citation impact on average, using a citation prediction model. We discuss the potential implications of these results for authors (researchers) and journal publishers who make the effort of sharing their data in repositories. All our data and code are made available in order to reproduce and extend our results."
https://openalex.org/W3017270069,"Astrocytes play essential roles in brain function by supporting synaptic connectivity and associated circuits. How these roles are regulated by transcription factors is unknown. Moreover, there is emerging evidence that astrocytes exhibit regional heterogeneity, and the mechanisms controlling this diversity remain nascent. Here, we show that conditional deletion of the transcription factor nuclear factor I-A (NFIA) in astrocytes in the adult brain results in region-specific alterations in morphology and physiology that are mediated by selective DNA binding. Disruptions in astrocyte function following loss of NFIA are most pronounced in the hippocampus, manifested by impaired interactions with neurons, coupled with diminution of learning and memory behaviors. These changes in hippocampal astrocytes did not affect basal neuronal properties but specifically inhibited synaptic plasticity, which is regulated by NFIA in astrocytes through calcium-dependent mechanisms. Together, our studies reveal region-specific transcriptional dependencies for astrocytes and identify astrocytic NFIA as a key transcriptional regulator of hippocampal circuits."

Telomeres, the repetitive DNA sequences capping chromosome ends, regulate cellular aging (López-Otín et al., 2013López-Otín C. Blasco M.A. Partridge L. Serrano M. Kroemer G. The hallmarks of aging.Cell. 2013; 153: 1194-1217Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (7849) Google Scholar). Telomeres undergo attrition with each cell division due to the inability of DNA polymerases to completely replicate linear chromosome ends (Olovnikov, 1973Olovnikov A.M. A theory of marginotomy.

To maintain replicative capacity, human stem cells express telomerase reverse transcriptase (TERT), which together with the non-coding RNA (ncRNA) template telomerase RNA component (TERC) comprise a functional telomerase ribonucleoprotein (RNP) to replenish telomere repeats (Feng et al., 1995Feng J.

TERC is a 451-nt-long box H/ACA small Cajal body RNA (scaRNA) bound by several additional factors (dyskerin, NOP10, NHP2, GAR1, and TCAB1) that stabilize and traffic telomerase RNP to Cajal bodies (Jády et al., 2004Jády B.E.

TERC and its associated factors are ubiquitously expressed in human somatic cells but are insufficient to elongate telomeres (Feng et al., 1995Feng J. Funk W.D. Wang S.S. Weinrich S.L. Avilion A.A.

The ectopic expression of TERT completes the telomerase RNP and confers immortality to somatic cells (Bodnar et al., 1998Bodnar A.G. Ouellette M. Frolkis M. Holt S.E. Chiu C.P. Morin G.B. Harley C.B.

Mendelian disorders associated with compromised telomere maintenance cause a spectrum of telomere biology diseases (TBDs), ranging from severe, early-onset syndromes such as dyskeratosis congenita (DC) to more common midlife presentations of seemingly isolated aplastic anemia, liver cirrhosis, or pulmonary fibrosis (PF) (Armanios and Blackburn, 2012Armanios M.

Mutations impacting TERT and TERC most often underlie TBDs, alongside other genes regulating telomere structure and replication (Bertuch, 2016Bertuch A.A. The molecular genetics of the telomere biology disorders.RNA Biol. 2016; 13: 696-706Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar). Across the range of TBDs there are no curative therapies, only bone marrow or organ transplantation that are associated with poor outcomes due to impaired tissue function and regenerative capacity throughout the body (Agarwal, 2018Agarwal S.

Although TERT is the “on/off” switch for telomerase activity, human genetic data indicate that TERC is limiting and determines telomerase activity in human stem cells once TERT is expressed (Greider, 2006Greider C.W.

We show that pharmacologic PAPD5 inhibition reverses TERC oligoadenylation and increases TERC in human cell lines, primary cells and induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) from DC patients, and CRISPR/Cas9-engineered PARN-deficient primary human hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells (HSPCs). While TERC levels are restored across all of the different cell types tested, we find an increase in telomerase activity and telomere length only in TERT-expressing cells. At PAPD5 inhibitor levels sufficient to increase telomere length in patient iPSCs, few changes are observed in other mRNAs and ncRNAs across the transcriptome, revealing unexpected specificity and supporting a potential therapeutic window. In mice xenotransplanted with human PARN-deficient HSPCs, oral administration of PAPD5 inhibitors is tolerated for months and restores TERC maturation and telomere elongation. Our findings validate PAPD5 as a target to control TERC levels and telomere elongation in human stem cells and identify BCH001 and RG7834 as promising leads in a new class of telomere therapeutics. To discover PAPD5 inhibitors, we designed and executed a high-throughput luciferase-based screen, measuring ATP consumption by recombinant PAPD5 (rPAPD5) during RNA poly-adenylation in vitro (Figures 1A and S1A–S1D). We screened 100,055 chemically diverse small molecules and identified several that reduced rPAPD5-mediated RNA 3′- polyadenylation (Figures 1B and S1E). 480 compounds were selected for their ability to inhibit PAPD5 in a dose-dependent manner, and 72 of these showed specificity for PAPD5 versus the canonical yeast poly(A) polymerase. We further triaged the compounds using four assays: (1) direct visualization of dose-dependent inhibition of RNA oligoadenylation on a polyacrylamide gel; (2) specificity versus other canonical and non-canonical poly-nucleotide polymerases; (3) specificity versus PARN, which like PAPD5 is a member of the superfamily of β-nucleotidyltransferases (Aravind and Koonin, 1999Aravind L. Koonin E.V. DNA polymerase beta-like nucleotidyltransferase superfamily: identification of three new families, classification and evolutionary history.Nucleic Acids Res. 1999; 27: 1609-1618Crossref PubMed Scopus (274) Google Scholar) and whose inhibition would be expected to be counterproductive; and (4) cell-based assays using PARN mutant DC patient iPSCs (Figure 1B). Through this process, we identified a single compound, a quinoline derivative dubbed BCH001 (Figure 1B). BCH001 inhibited rPAPD5 in the low micromolar range in vitro and showed no inhibition of PARN or several other canonical and non-canonical polynucleotide polymerases (Figures 1C–1E). By differential scanning fluorimetry (DSF), BCH001 exhibited ATP- and dose-dependent binding to rPAPD5 (Figure 1F). In multiple clones of PARN mutant iPSCs from three patients, treatment with 1 μM BCH001 for 7 days reversed TERC 3′ end processing defects, including a decrease in overall 3′ end adenylation of TERC species (Figures 2A, 2B, S2A, and S2B). Concordant with this result, northern blot analysis showed that TERC steady-state levels increased across all replicates and were accompanied by increases in telomerase activity levels without affecting TERT expression (Figures 2C–2E). Remarkably, with continued exposure, we observed elongation of telomere ends by thousands of nucleotides in BCH001-treated patient iPSCs compared to DMSO-treated controls (Figure 2F). Telomeres were elongated in a dose-dependent manner at 0.1–1 μM BCH001 in patient iPSCs (Figure S2C). These results were similar to those seen when we used CRISPR/Cas9 to delete PAPD5 in PARN mutant patient iPSCs, which showed “dose-dependent” rescue of TERC processing, TERC levels, and telomere length (Figures S2D–S2G). When we tested BCH001 in a PARN-deficient HEK293 heterologous cell context, we also found restored TERC 3′ end maturation and steady-state levels and increased telomere length (Figures S3A–S3C). Taken together, these results comprise a novel demonstration of TERC modulation using small molecules to increase telomere length in human cells. We found that patient iPSCs could be cultured continuously in 1 μM BCH001 for months, establishing a normalized telomere length setpoint (Figure 3A). Importantly, telomere length did not continue to extend beyond that of wild-type (WT) iPSCs (Figure 3A), as we observed in PAPD5-null CRISPR/Cas9-engineered clones (Figure S2G), consistent with the notion that counterregulatory mechanisms limiting excessive telomere elongation remain intact (Greider, 2016Greider C.W.

We found there was no adverse impact on cell growth, cell cycle, or apoptosis when cells were cultured with BCH001 at concentrations sufficient to increase telomere length (Figures S3D–S3F). When BCH001 was removed, TERC maturation and TERC levels reverted to pathological levels, and telomere length decreased gradually over the course of weeks (Figures 3A–3C). Collectively, these results indicate that ongoing PAPD5 inhibition is required for telomere maintenance and argue against selection of cells with higher TERC levels, longer telomeres, or activation of alternative mechanisms of telomere maintenance by BCH001. To identify transcriptome-wide changes caused by PAPD5 inhibitors in PARN mutant patient iPSCs, we performed RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) on total RNA. We found that only the non-coding small Cajal body RNA13 (scaRNA13), which is known to be dependent on PARN for stability (Moon et al., 2015Moon D.H. Segal M. Boyraz B. Guinan E. Hofmann I. Cahan P.

When we examined scaRNA13 transcripts by rapid amplification of cDNA ends (RACE) and northern blot, we found 3′ extended forms and decreased steady-state levels, both of which were rescued by treatment with BCH001, as seen with TERC (Figures 3D and 3E). We found similar results upon analysis of scaRNA8 (Figures 3D and 3E), another ncRNA recently shown to be regulated by PARN and PAPD5 (Son et al., 2018Son A. Park J.E. Kim V.N.

These data lend further evidence that mRNAs are not a major target of the PARN/PAPD5 axis and are consistent with findings that other RNAs impacted by PARN loss of function are restored by RNA interference of PAPD5 (Shukla et al., 2019Shukla S.

Taken together, the results indicate minimal changes in the ncRNA transcriptome after PAPD5 inhibition, and demonstrate that ncRNAs dysregulated by PARN deficiency beyond TERC can be restored by small-molecule PAPD5 inhibitors.

https://openalex.org/W3015604723,"Separation of eukaryotic sister chromatids during the cell cycle is timed by the spindle assembly checkpoint (SAC) and ultimately triggered when separase cleaves cohesion-mediating cohesin1–3. Silencing of the SAC during metaphase activates the ubiquitin ligase APC/C (anaphase-promoting complex, also known as the cyclosome) and results in the proteasomal destruction of the separase inhibitor securin1. In the absence of securin, mammalian chromosomes still segregate on schedule, but it is unclear how separase is regulated under these conditions4,5. Here we show that human shugoshin 2 (SGO2), an essential protector of meiotic cohesin with unknown functions in the soma6,7, is turned into a separase inhibitor upon association with SAC-activated MAD2. SGO2–MAD2 can functionally replace securin and sequesters most separase in securin-knockout cells. Acute loss of securin and SGO2, but not of either protein individually, resulted in separase deregulation associated with premature cohesin cleavage and cytotoxicity. Similar to securin8,9, SGO2 is a competitive inhibitor that uses a pseudo-substrate sequence to block the active site of separase. APC/C-dependent ubiquitylation and action of the AAA-ATPase TRIP13 in conjunction with the MAD2-specific adaptor p31comet liberate separase from SGO2–MAD2 in vitro. The latter mechanism facilitates a considerable degree of sister chromatid separation in securin-knockout cells that lack APC/C activity. Thus, our results identify an unexpected function of SGO2 in mitotically dividing cells and a mechanism of separase regulation that is independent of securin but still supervised by the SAC. Shugoshin and MAD2 regulate separase-mediated chromosome separation during mitosis, in parallel to a previously identified mechanism involving the anaphase inhibitor securin."
https://openalex.org/W3017261207,"Global threats to ocean biodiversity have generated a worldwide movement to take actions to improve conservation and management. Several international initiatives have recommended the adoption of marine protected areas (MPAs) in national and international waters. National governments and the Commission for the Conservation of Antarctic Marine Living Resources have successfully adopted multiple MPAs in the Southern Ocean despite the challenging nature of establishing MPAs in international waters. But are these MPAs representative of Southern Ocean biodiversity? Here we answer this question for both existing and proposed Antarctic MPAs, using benthic and pelagic regionalizations as a proxy for biodiversity. Currently about 11.98% of the Southern Ocean is protected in MPAs, with 4.61% being encompassed by no-take areas. While this is a relatively large proportion of protection when compared to other international waters, current Antarctic MPAs are not representative of the full range of benthic and pelagic ecoregions. Implementing additional protected areas, including those currently under negotiation, would encompass almost 22% of the Southern Ocean. It would also substantially improve representation with 17 benthic and pelagic ecoregions (out of 23 and 19, respectively) achieving at least 10% representation."

https://openalex.org/W3016418892,"Modern survey methods may be subject to non-observable bias, from various sources. Among online surveys, for example, selection bias is prevalent, due to the sampling mechanism commonly used, whereby participants self-select from a subgroup whose characteristics differ from those of the target population. Several techniques have been proposed to tackle this issue. One such is Propensity Score Adjustment (PSA), which is widely used and has been analysed in various studies. The usual method of estimating the propensity score is logistic regression, which requires a reference probability sample in addition to the online nonprobability sample. The predicted propensities can be used for reweighting using various estimators. However, in the online survey context, there are alternatives that might outperform logistic regression regarding propensity estimation. The aim of the present study is to determine the efficiency of some of these alternatives, involving Machine Learning (ML) classification algorithms. PSA is applied in two simulation scenarios, representing situations commonly found in online surveys, using logistic regression and ML models for propensity estimation. The results obtained show that ML algorithms remove selection bias more effectively than logistic regression when used for PSA, but that their efficacy depends largely on the selection mechanism employed and the dimensionality of the data."

This study aims to assess the TB treatment outcomes among patients registered in the national TB surveillance database in Malaysia from 2014 until 2017 and identify factors associated with unsuccessful treatment outcomes and all-cause mortality.Using registry-based secondary data, a retrospective cohort study was conducted. TB patients' sociodemographic characteristics, clinical disease data and treatment outcomes at one-year surveillance were extracted from the database and analyzed. Logistic regression analysis was used to determine factors associated with unsuccessful treatment outcomes and all-cause mortality.A total of 97,505 TB cases (64.3% males) were included in this study. TB treatment success (cases categorized as cured and completed treatment) was observed in 80.7% of the patients. Among the 19.3% patients with unsuccessful treatment outcomes, 10.2% died, 5.3% were lost to follow-up, 3.6% had outcomes not evaluated while the remaining failed treatment. Unsuccessful TB treatment outcomes were found to be associated with older age, males, foreign nationality, urban dwellers, lower education levels, passive detection of TB cases, absence of bacille Calmette-Guerin (BCG) scar, underlying diabetes mellitus, smoking, extrapulmonary TB, history of previous TB treatment, advanced chest radiography findings and human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection. Factors found associated with all-cause mortality were similar except for nationality (higher among Malaysians) and place of residence (higher among rural dwellers), while smoking and history of previous TB treatment were not found to be associated with all-cause mortality.This study identified various sociodemographic characteristics and TB disease-related variables which were associated with unsuccessful TB treatment outcomes and mortality; these can be used to guide measures for risk assessment and stratification of TB patients in future."

Annual CLCuD incidences during 2012 to 2014 were estimated to be 37.5%, 63.6%, and 38.8% respectively. Cotton leaves were collected from symptomatic plants annually for three years and subjected to DNA isolation, followed by rolling circle amplification (RCA), cloning, and DNA sequencing of apparently full-length begomoviral genomes and associated betasatellites and alphasatellites. Among the thirteen CLCuD-begomoviral genomes recovered, eight were identified as Cotton leaf curl Multan virus-Rajasthan (CLCuMuV-Ra), one as -Pakistan (PK) and another as -Faisalabad (Fai), whereas, three were as Cotton leaf curl Kokhran virus-Burewala (CLCuKoV-Bu), indicating that CLCuMuV-Ra was the most prevalent begomovirus species. Five of the eight CLCuMuV-Ra sequences were found to be recombinants. The CLCuMuV-Ra- associated satellites consisted of Cotton leaf curl Multan betasatellite (CLCuMB), and Gossypium darwinii symptomless alphasatellite (GDarSLA), and Croton yellow vein mosaic alphasatellite (CrYVMoA).

With data from four of these projects, we computed probabilistic forecasts of the replication outcomes, which we then evaluated regarding discrimination, calibration and sharpness. A novel model, which can take into account both inflation and heterogeneity of effects, was used and predicted the effect estimate of the replication study with good performance in two of the four data sets. In the other two data sets, predictive performance was still substantially improved compared to the naive model which does not consider inflation and heterogeneity of effects. The results suggest that many of the estimates from the original studies were inflated, possibly caused by publication bias or questionable research practices, and also that some degree of heterogeneity between original and replication effects should be expected. Moreover, the results indicate that the use of statistical significance as the only criterion for replication success may be questionable, since from a predictive viewpoint, non-significant replication results are often compatible with significant results from the original study. The developed statistical methods as well as the data sets are available in the R package ReplicationSuccess."
https://openalex.org/W3016695406,"Background Community-based management of acute malnutrition (CMAM) is an effective program to manage children with acute malnutrition, including both severe and moderate acute malnutrition. However, little is known about continued child nutritional status after discharge from community based management of acute malnutrition programs in Ethiopia. Objective The study aimed to identify factors associated with relapse of acute malnutrition among children 6–59 months after been discharged recovered from community based management program in South Gondar Zone, Northwest Ethiopia. Methods A case-control study was conducted in three districts of South Gondar Zone by tracing children age 6–59 months who were reported as recovered from the community based management program. Sample size calculated for the first objective of assessing prevalence of severe acute malnutrition among children following discharge as recovery using Epi- Info version 7.1.3.3 StatCalc taking 95% CL, 17.8% post discharge relapse (Ashraf H, et al. (2012), 3% margin of error, design effect of 2 and adding 5% non-response rate was the largest sample size and used to this study. Children with Mid Upper Arm Circumference (MUAC) <12.5cm constituted cases and children with > = 12.5cm served as controls. Data were collected from 10 November 2017 to 30 January 2018 using a survey questionnaire and families were asked to bring children to a health facility for anthropometric measurements, following which data were entered and analyzed. Bivariate and multivariable logistic regression models were utilized to measure association between the risk factors and acute malnutrition. Results Overall, 1,273 participants were interviewed. The mean age in months of children was 23.1 (±9.1 SD) for cases and 23.1 (±8.9 SD) for controls. About 40% of the cases and 50% of the controls were female children. The factors associated with acute malnutrition were: male children (AOR = 1.84, 95% CI: 1.42–2.39), living in a food insecure household (AOR = 1.67, 95% CI:1.15–2.44), non-receipt of Vitamin A supplement (AOR = 1.76, 95% CI: 1.28–2.41), prelacteal feeding (AOR = 2.81 (95%CI, 1.57–5.05), distance to water source more than 15 walk (AOR = 1.88, 95% CI:1.32–2.71), less frequent self-reported hand washing (AOR = 1.35, 95% CI:1.05–1.75), mother not having consumed extra food during this pregnancy/lactation (AOR = 1.36, 95% CI: 1.03–1.78), and respondent age above 30 years (AOR = 1.43, 95% CI:1.10–1.87). Conclusion The key factors contributing to relapse of acute malnutrition were related to childcare and feeding practices. Social and behavior change communication strategies targeting families at risk of undernutrition, along with improved food security and integrated programming are recommended to prevent relapse of acute malnutrition."
https://openalex.org/W3016875878,"Background Hepatitis B (HB) is a viral infection that affects the liver and can lead to life-threatening conditions including cirrhosis and liver cancer. Over a billion people are estimated to be infected globally with the hepatitis B virus, with over 240 million chronically infected. Sub-Saharan Africa including Ghana is an HBV endemic area and an estimated 5%– 10% of the population in the region is infected. Research on the knowledge and vaccination status of hepatitis B in rural communities in Ghana is lacking. Objectives The objectives of this study proposed were to assess the HBV knowledge, risk of HBV infection, and vaccination status of high school students in two rural districts of the Northern region on Ghana. Methods A cross-sectional study of a random sample of 426 students from two senior high schools in the Nanumba North and South districts of the Northern region of Ghana on hepatitis B knowledge and vaccination status was conducted. Descriptive statistics were used to analyze and present data on demographic and knowledge variables. A Mann Whitney U test was used to compare the differences in HBV knowledge between male and female students and between students of the two high schools that were involved in the study. Pearson correlation coefficient was used to compute the association between HBV knowledge and age of students. Logistic regression was used to develop a model to predict variables that influenced vaccination against HB. Results The results of the study showed basic but not a good knowledge of HBV among the rural high school students, with a mean score of 11.8 (SD = 1.98) out of a maximum score of 16. Descriptive statistics also revealed that only 20% of 426 students ever tested for HBV and 96 (22.5%) were vaccinated against HBV. A Mann-Whitney U test results revealed no statistically significant difference in HBV knowledge between male and female students (p = 0.688, two-tailed) and between the two high schools (p = 0.24, two-tailed). A Pearson correlation showed no relationship between age and HBV knowledge (p = 0.486). Regression analysis showed that only taking the HBV test (p <0.05) and attending Bimbilla Senior High (p = 0.032) significantly predicted vaccination against HBV infection. Conclusion The results of this study has re-echoed the high prevalence of HBV in Ghana. The poor state of knowledge and a high risk of HBV infection among young adults in rural communities have also been highlighted in the findings of this study. Vaccination against the HBV infection was found to be low and consistent with other findings. Finally, HBV screening is shown to be significantly associated with vaccination against the virus, hence the need for national screening and vaccination programs."
https://openalex.org/W3017312781,"Background Neonatal infections remain a leading cause of newborn deaths globally. In 2015, WHO issued guidelines for managing possible serious bacterial infection (PSBI) in young infants (0–59 days) using simplified antibiotic regimens when compliance with hospital referral is not feasible. Bangladesh was one of the first countries to adopt WHO’s guidelines for implementation. We report results of an implementation research study that assessed facility readiness and provider performance in three rural sub-districts of Bangladesh during August 2015-August 2016. Methods This study took place in 19 primary health centers. Facility readiness was assessed using checklists completed by study staff at three time points. To assess provider performance, we extracted data for all infection cases from facility registers and compared providers’ diagnosis and treatment against the guidelines. We plotted classification and dosage errors across the study period and superimposed a locally weighted smoothed (LOWESS) curve to analyze changes in performance over time. Focus group discussions (N = 2) and in-depth interviews (N = 28) with providers were conducted to identify barriers and facilitators for facility readiness and provider performance. Results At baseline, none of the facilities had adequate supply of antibiotics. During the 10-month period, 606 sick infants with signs of infection presented at the study facilities. Classification errors were identified in 14.9% (N = 90/606) of records. For infants receiving the first dose(s) of antibiotic treatment (N = 551), dosage errors were identified in 22.9% (N = 126/551) of the records. Distribution of errors varied by facility (35.7% [IQR: 24.7–57.4%]) and infection severity. Errors were highest at the beginning of the study period and decreased over time. Qualitative data suggest errors in early implementation were due to changes in providers’ assessment and treatment practices, including confusion about classifying an infant with multiple signs of infection, and some providers’ concerns about the efficacy of simplified antibiotic regimens. Conclusions Strategies to monitor early performance and targeted supports are important for enhancing implementation fidelity when introducing complex guidelines in new settings. Future research should examine providers’ assessment of effectiveness of simplified treatment and address misconceptions about superiority of broader spectrum antibiotics for treating community-acquired neonatal infections in this context."
https://openalex.org/W3016528017,"The World Health Organization has recommended HIV self-testing (HIVST) as an alternative testing strategy given the limitations of facility-based testing. While the benefits of HIV self-testing have been demonstrated at the individual level among men who have sex with men (MSM), limited data exist on if this testing approach can be effectively diffused through individuals' social or sexual networks. The objectives of this study were to examine patterns and correlates of HIVST distribution within Chinese MSM's sexual networks.Data used for this analysis was a part of the process evaluation of an HIVST intervention trial among MSM in Nanjing, China. Between May and October 2017, we enrolled 400 men into the trial. Participants assigned to the intervention group (N = 200) were given three HIVST kits at baseline and could request more during the follow-up periods. We incorporated measures for process evaluation in the self-administered online follow-up surveys. This analysis reported findings from the three-month follow-up survey in the intervention group. Frequencies and percentages were used to describe characteristics of participants who distributed kits to their sexual partners as well as patterns of distribution. Multivariable logistic regression was conducted to identify independent correlates of participants who distributed the kits.Of the 177 participants retained (88.5%) at the three-month follow-up, 72 (40.7%) distributed one or more kits to either primary or casual partners. About half of distributors (51.4%) gave one HIVST kit to their sexual partners while 15.3% distributed 3 or more. Over half gave these kits (58.3%) to primary sexual partners while 27.8% reported giving the kits to both primary and casual partners. About half (54.2%) of distributors used the kits together with their partners. Compared to participants who had an HIV test in the past six months, those who tested over six months ago or never tested had significantly lower odds of distributing the kits (AOR = 0.484, 95% CI: 0.250-0.983, p = 0.032). Compared to those who had not used the kits themselves, participants who did had significantly higher odds of distributing the kits (AOR = 3.345, 95% CI: 1.488-7.517, p = 0.003). Participants who reported higher HIV testing efficacy had 2.051 fold greater odds (95% CI: 1.062-3.961, p = 0.033) of distributing the kits compared to those who had lower efficacy.Our study demonstrated that a sexual network-based approach to distributing HIVST among Chinese MSM is feasible and can be a promising strategy to improve the effectiveness of HIVST programs including its reach to untested men. Such approach should be complimented by intervention components that enhance HIV testing efficacy and improve experiences of HIVST."
https://openalex.org/W3016695035,"The emergence and rapid spread of unusual DS-1-like intergenogroup reassortant rotaviruses having G1/3/8 genotypes have been recently reported from major parts of the world (Africa, Asia, Australia, Europe, and the Americas). During rotavirus surveillance in Thailand, three novel intergenogroup reassortant strains possessing the G9P[8] genotype (DBM2017-016, DBM2017-203, and DBM2018-291) were identified in three stool specimens from diarrheic children. In the present study, we determined and analyzed the full genomes of these three strains. On full-genomic analysis, all three strains were found to share a unique genotype constellation comprising both genogroup 1 and 2 genes: G9-P[8]-I2-R2-C2-M2-A2-N2-T2-E2-H2. Phylogenetic analysis demonstrated that each of the 11 genes of the three strains was closely related to that of emerging DS-1-like intergenogroup reassortant, human, and/or locally circulating human strains. Thus, the three strains were suggested to be multiple reassortants that had acquired the G9-VP7 genes from co-circulating Wa-like G9P[8] rotaviruses in the genetic background of DS-1-like intergenogroup reassortant (likely equine-like G3P[8]) strains. To our knowledge, this is the first description of emerging DS-1-like intergenogroup reassortant strains having the G9P[8] genotype. Our observations will add to the growing insights into the dynamic evolution of emerging DS-1-like intergenogroup reassortant rotaviruses through reassortment."
https://openalex.org/W3016720595,"Subtle abnormalities in sensory integration, motor coordination and sequencing of complex motor acts or neurological soft signs (NSS) are characteristic phenomena in patients with schizophrenia at any stage of the illness. Previous MRI studies in schizophrenia found NSS to be associated with cortical, thalamic and cerebellar changes. Since these studies mainly focused on first-episode or recent onset schizophrenia, the cerebral correlates of NSS in chronic schizophrenia remained rather unclear. 49 middle-aged patients with chronic schizophrenia with a mean duration of illness of 20.3 ± 14.0 years and 29 healthy subjects matched for age and sex were included. NSS were examined on the Heidelberg Scale and correlated to grey matter (GM) by using whole brain high resolution magnetic resonance imaging (3 Tesla) with SPM12/CAT12 analyses. As expected, NSS in patients were significantly (p≤0.001) elevated in contrast to healthy controls, a finding, which not only applied to NSS total score, but also to the respective subscales ""motor coordination"", ""sensory integration"", ""complex motor tasks"", ""right/left and spatial orientation"" and ""hard signs"". Within the patient group NSS total scores were significantly correlated to reduced GM in right lingual gyrus, left parahippocampal gyrus, left superior temporal gyrus, left thalamus (medial dorsal nucleus) and left posterior lobe of the cerebellum (declive). Respective negative associations could also be revealed for the subscales ""motor coordination"", ""complex motor tasks"" and ""right/left and spatial orientation"". These findings remained significant after FWE-correction for multiple comparisons and were confirmed when years of education, chlorpromazine-equivalents or variables indicating the severity of psychopathology were introduced as additional covariates. According to our results lingual, parahippocampal, superior temporal, inferior and middle frontal gyri, thalamus and cerebellum have to be considered as important sites of NSS in chronic schizophrenia. That these findings only applied for patients but not healthy controls may indicate a different pathogenesis of NSS."
https://openalex.org/W3017164164,"Populations of freshwater dolphins are declining in response to increased human pressure, including habitat degradation, overfishing, bycatch, poaching and obstruction of free-flowing river corridors by dams. At least three river dolphin species occur in South America: the Amazonian river dolphin, or boto (Inia geoffrensis), the Bolivian river dolphin (Inia boliviensis) and the tucuxi (Sotalia fluviatilis). A fourth species, the Araguaian boto (Inia araguaiaensis), been proposed for the Tocantins-Araguaia, a large river basin in northern Brazil. Here we show that the Araguaian boto population in the Tocantins River is relatively small (N = 1083, CV = 0.52). During a survey to estimate density and abundance, 138 groups (198 individuals) of botos were observed along a ~600 km stretch of the Tocantins River in five different habitats (river margin, river channel, channel, island margin, and a dam reservoir). Overall, lower densities of the Araguaian boto were registered downstream of the Tucuruí dam, the world's fifth largest hydropower dam. Density was 68% lower in the river margin habitat downstream (0.23 ind./km2, CV = 0.92) than upstream (0.72 ind./km2, CV = 0.53). In addition, density within the Tucuruí reservoir decreases from upstream areas towards the dam. Geographic post-stratification of data into sub-regions (downstream, reservoir, upstream) in relation to the Tucuruí dam helped to reduce CV by ~70%, which illustrates the high variability in the encounter rate in these areas. Our findings suggest that the Araguaian boto population has been impacted by the construction of the Tucuruí dam. The construction of other dams proposed for the Tocantins-Araguaia basin should be planned strategically to minimize overlapping with the Araguaian boto distribution. Coordinated conservation actions are imperative to prevent the Araguaian boto from reaching extinction or near-extinction as some of their Asian counterparts such as the Yangtze, Ganges, and Indus river dolphins."

The glycosylphosphatidylinositol (GPI) anchor of PrPC is involved in prion disease pathogenesis, and especially sialic acid in a GPI side chain reportedly affects PrPC conversion. Thus, it is important to define the location and structure of the GPI anchor in human PrPC. Moreover, the sialic acid linkage type in the GPI side chain has not been determined for any GPI-anchored protein. Here we report GPI glycan structures of human PrPC isolated from human brains and from brains of a knock-in mouse model in which the mouse prion protein (Prnp) gene was replaced with the human PRNP gene. LC–electrospray ionization–MS analysis of human PrPC from both biological sources indicated that Gly229 is the ω site in PrPC to which GPI is attached. Gly229 in human PrPC does not correspond to Ser231, the previously reported ω site of Syrian hamster PrPC. We found that ∼41% and 28% of GPI anchors in human PrPCs from human and knock-in mouse brains, respectively, have N-acetylneuraminic acid in the side chain. Using a sialic acid linkage-specific alkylamidation method to discriminate α2,3 linkage from α2,6 linkage, we found that N-acetylneuraminic acid in PrPC's GPI side chain is linked to galactose through an α2,3 linkage.

Glycosylphosphatidylinositol (GPI) anchoring is a posttranslational modification by a glycolipid and is highly conserved among eukaryotes. Precursors of GPI-anchored proteins (GPI-APs) have a GPI attachment signal peptide at the C terminus, which is cleaved off and replaced by a preassembled GPI (1Kinoshita T.

The amino acid residue to which GPI is attached is termed the ω site (1Kinoshita T.

GPI biosynthesis occurs in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER), followed by attachment to proteins generating nascent GPI-APs. GPI-APs then undergo structural remodeling of the GPI moiety by post-GPI attachment to protein 1 (PGAP1) and PGAP5 in the ER (4Tanaka S. Maeda Y. Tashima Y. Kinoshita T.

After PGAP1- and PGAP5-dependent reactions, GPI-APs efficiently exit from the ER, mediated by a specific cargo receptor consisting of p24 family proteins (6Fujita M. Watanabe R. Jaensch N.

They then enter the Golgi apparatus, where they undergo fatty acid remodeling, in which PGAP3 removes an unsaturated fatty acid (usually arachidonic acid) at the sn-2 position, and PGAP2 attaches a saturated fatty acid (usually stearic acid) to the same position, which facilitates association of GPI-APs with lipid rafts (7Maeda Y.

One is an EtNP side chain linked to the 2 position of the first Man, Man being linked to GlcN (Fig. 1A) (9Hong Y. Maeda Y. Watanabe R. Ohishi K. Mishkind M. Riezman H. Kinoshita T.

This EtNP side chain, which is added during GPI biosynthesis in the ER, is common among mammalian GPI-APs. Another side chain is the fourth Man linked to the third Man via α1,2 linkage (Fig. 1A).

The GalNAc modification occurs for GPI-APs in the Golgi apparatus after fatty acid remodeling (12Hirata T. Mishra S.K. Nakamura S. Saito K. Motooka D. Takada Y. Kanzawa N. Murakami Y. Maeda Y.

The GalNAc side chain may be further elongated by β1,3-linked galactose (Gal) and then by sialic acid (Sia) (Fig. 1A) (13Stahl N. Baldwin M.A. Hecker R. Pan K.M. Burlingame A.L. Prusiner S.B.

We recently identified PGAP4 (also known as TMEM246 or C9orf125) as a GPI-specific GalNAc transferase (12Hirata T. Mishra S.K. Nakamura S. Saito K. Motooka D. Takada Y. Kanzawa N. Murakami Y.

More recently, we reported that B3GALT4, which is also known as ganglioside GM1 synthase, also acts as a Gal transferase for the GPI GalNAc side chain (14Wang Y. Maeda Y. Liu Y.S. Takada Y.

Although these achievements have furthered our understanding of the GPI GalNAc side chain, the biosynthesis pathway of the GPI glycan structure is still incompletely understood. A major issue to be resolved is identification the sialyltransferase. Currently, the characteristics of the enzyme are not known because of a lack of information, including the linkage type. Therefore, determination of the Sia linkage type is important. Prion diseases, including Creutzfeldt–Jakob disease in humans and scrapie or bovine spongiform encephalopathy in animals, are lethal, transmissible, and progressive neurodegenerative disorders. These are designated protein misfolding disorders, similar to other neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease, Huntington's disease, and ALS (15Aguzzi A. Lakkaraju A.K.K. cell biology of prions and prionoids: a status report.Trends Cell Biol. 2016; 26 (26455408): 40-5110.1016/j.tcb.2015.08.007Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). When specific proteins are misfolded because of aging or genetic background, they aggregate and accumulate in cells, leading to cell death. Prion diseases are caused by accumulation of the scrapie form of the prion protein (PrPSc), which is converted from the normal cellular prion protein (PrPC) (16Prusiner S.B. Scott M.R. DeArmond S.J. Cohen F.E. Prion protein biology.Cell. 1998; 93 (9590169): 337-34810.1016/S0092-8674(00)81163-0Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (795) Google Scholar). PrPC has an α helix–rich structure, whereas PrPSc contains more β sheet structures. Prnp (the gene encoding PrPC) knockout mice are resistant to prion disease even after inoculation with PrPSc (17Büeler H. Aguzzi A. Sailer A. Greiner R.A. Autenried P. Aguet M. Weissmann C. Mice devoid of PrP are resistant to scrapie.Cell. 1993; 73 (8100741): 1339-134710.1016/0092-8674(93)90360-3Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1735) Google Scholar, 18Prusiner S.B. Groth D.

Because PrPC is anchored on the cell surface via a GPI anchor, previous studies have attempted to uncover the involvement of the GPI anchor in conversion. Although cultured cells expressing GPI anchor–less PrPC were unable to support persistent infection in vitro (19McNally K.L. Ward A.E. Priola S.A. Cells expressing anchorless prion protein are resistant to scrapie infection.J. Virol. 2009; 83 (19225008): 4469-447510.1128/JVI.02412-08Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar), transgenic mice expressing only GPI anchor–less PrPC showed accumulation of PrPSc and replication of infectivity in the brain after inoculation with PrPSc (20Chesebro B. Trifilo M. Race R. Meade-White K. Teng C. LaCasse R. Raymond L. Favara C. Baron G. Priola S. Caughey B. Masliah E. Oldstone M. Anchorless prion protein results in infectious amyloid disease without clinical scrapie.Science. 2005; 308 (15933194): 1435-143910.1126/science.1110837Crossref PubMed Scopus (506) Google Scholar). Transgenic mice had a prolonged incubation period, altered deposition pattern of PrPSc, and distinctive spread pattern of PrPSc in the brain (21Rangel A. Race B. Phillips K. Striebel J. Kurtz N. Chesebro B. Distinct patterns of spread of prion infection in brains of mice expressing anchorless or anchored forms of prion protein.Acta Neuropathol. Commun. 2014; 2 (24447368): 810.1186/2051-5960-2-8Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). In addition, studies investigating Sia in the GPI anchor strengthen the possibility that the GPI anchor is involved in prion pathogenesis. Desialylated PrPC is resistant to conversion to PrPSc in cultured neurons (22Bate C. Nolan W. Williams A. Sialic acid on the glycosylphosphatidylinositol anchor regulates PrP-mediated cell signaling and prion formation.J. Biol. Chem. 2016; 291 (26553874): 160-17010.1074/jbc.M115.672394Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). Moreover, mice expressing PrPC lacking Sia on the GPI anchor have a prolonged incubation time after PrPSc inoculation (23Puig B. Altmeppen H.C. Linsenmeier L. Chakroun K. Wegwitz F. Piontek U.K. Tatzelt J. Bate C. Magnus T. Glatzel M. GPI-anchor signal sequence influences PrPC sorting, shedding and signalling, and impacts on different pathomechanistic aspects of prion disease in mice.PLoS Pathog. 2019; 15 (30608982): e100752010.1371/journal.ppat.1007520Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar). These studies indicate the significance of the PrPC GPI anchor for the pathogenesis of prion diseases. Therefore, understanding precise structures of human PrPC GPI is important to fully understand the role of the GPI anchor in PrPSc. Nevertheless, elucidation of the human PrPC GPI anchor structure has not been achieved, although an early study determined GPI structures in the Syrian hamster (13Stahl N. Baldwin M.A. Hecker R. Pan K.M. Burlingame A.L. Prusiner S.B. Glycosylinositol phospholipid anchors of the scrapie and cellular prion proteins contain sialic acid.Biochemistry. 1992; 31 (1350920): 5043-505310.1021/bi00136a600Crossref PubMed Scopus (218) Google Scholar). In this study, we affinity-purified PrPC from knock-in (KI) mouse brains in which Prnp was replaced by human PRNP and from human brains and determined their GPI glycan structure by LC–electrospray ionization (ESI)–MS and the linkage type of Sia using the sialic acid linkage-specific alkylamidation (SALSA) method. We identified the ω site of human PrPC as Gly229 and the Sia linkage type as α2,3 linkage. For structural analysis of GPI glycan by MS, the lipid portion of the GPI anchor has to be removed because the presence of lipid interferes with ionization, and, even when ionized, the pattern of product ions is highly complex and confounds analysis. Thus, we first tested phosphatidylinositol-specific phospholipase C (PI-PLC) for removal of the lipid portion of the GPI anchor in mouse brains. The mouse brain (especially the medulla oblongata) contains high levels of free GPIs with the GalNAc side chain that are not associated with proteins and exist as glycolipids on the cell surface (24Wang Y.

We estimated the effect of PI-PLC treatment based on loss of free GPIs. We prepared mouse medulla oblongata homogenates and incubated them with PI-PLC. Samples were subjected to Western blotting with an anti-T5 antibody, which specifically detects free GPIs with GalNAc (12Hirata T. Mishra S.K. Nakamura S. Saito K. Motooka D. Takada Y. Kanzawa N.

In contrast, no signals were obtained after PI-PLC treatment, indicating that PI-PLC worked well (Fig. 1B). Previously, we generated KI mice expressing human PrPC with the 129M/M genotype (Ki-Hu129M/M) (26Asano M. Mohri S. Ironside J.W. Ito M. Tamaoki N. Kitamoto T. vCJD prion acquires altered virulence through trans-species infection.Biochem. Biophys. Res.

To investigate the structure of the human PrPC GPI glycan, we affinity-purified human PrPC from KI mouse brains after PI-PLC treatment and then treated the isolated PrPC with peptide N-glycosidase F (PNG-F) to remove N-glycans. The prepared sample was separated by SDS-PAGE, and the gel was stained with Coomassie Brilliant Blue to visualize bands of PNG-F and human PrPC lacking N-glycans (Fig. 1C). We excised the band corresponding to de-N-glycosylated human PrPC and subjected the isolated gel fragment to analysis. To determine the ω-site amino acid and GPI glycan structures of human PrPC, we first performed LC-ESI-MS analysis. Proteins in the excised gel fragment were digested with trypsin, and the samples were separated by reverse-phase HPLC using a nanoLC system connected to a C18 column. Data were obtained by LTQ Orbitrap Velos MS. A MASCOT search revealed eight peptides of human PrPC, and the coverage was 41% (Fig. 2A and Table S1), indicating that the excised gel fragment mainly contained human PrPC. We searched for peptides with GPI glycan, which contain fragment ions of m/z 422+ and 447+ in the MS/MS profiles (these fragments contain GlcN, which is highly specific to GPI glycan). However, we barely detected peptides containing GPI glycan in this way, probably because of low hydrophobicity of the expected peptides containing a short peptide with large hydrophilic glycans. To overcome this problem, sample separation was performed by forward-phase HPLC with nanoLC using a hydrophilic interaction LC (HILIC) column, which can capture hydrophilic peptides. Using a HILIC column, we found six PrPC peptides (Table S2) and a C-terminal peptide with GPI glycan (total ion chromatogram and MS spectra are shown in Fig. S1, A and B). We initially speculated that the ω site of human PrPC was Ser230 by using PredGPI software to predict GPI attachment sites and because of homology to the Syrian hamster PrPC sequence (whose ω site is Ser231) (Fig. 2B) (27Pierleoni A. Martelli P.L. Casadio R. PredGPI: a GPI-anchor predictor.BMC Bioinformatics. 2008; 9 (18811934): 39210.1186/1471-2105-9-392Crossref PubMed Scopus (343) Google Scholar, 28Stahl N. Baldwin M.A. Burlingame A.L. Prusiner S.B. Identification of glycoinositol phospholipid linked and truncated forms of the scrapie prion protein.Biochemistry. 1990; 29 (1980209): 8879-888410.1021/bi00490a001Crossref PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar). Unexpectedly, we only identified Gly229 GPI glycan but not Gly229-Ser230 GPI glycan (Table S3; raw data are available from PRIDE). These results strongly indicate that Gly229 and not Ser230 is the bona fide ω site of human PrPC. We compared the sequence of GPI attachment signal among various species, including human and Syrian hamster. Alignment of PrPC peptides indicated that Syrian hamster Ser231 is conserved among rodent PrPC proteins, whereas human Gly229 is conserved among nonrodent species such as cows and sheep (Fig. 2B). Based on the known structures of the mammalian GPI anchors, there are eight possible GPI glycan species: core only (m/z 1211.3+), core + fourth Man (m/z 1373.4+), core + GalNAc (m/z 1414.4+), core + GalNAc + fourth Man (m/z 1576.4+), core + GalNAc + Gal (m/z 1576.4+), core + GalNAc + Gal + fourth Man (m/z 1738.5+), core + GalNAc + Gal + Sia (m/z 1867.5+ when Sia is N-acetylneuraminic acid (Neu5Ac)), and core + GalNAc + Gal + Sia + fourth Man (m/z 2029.6+ when Sia is Neu5Ac). Because MS analysis provides m/z only, peptides with the same m/z, such as core + GalNAc + fourth Man and core + GalNAc + Gal cannot be distinguished, and the precise sugar species are not determined. Thus, there are seven possible species in MS analysis. We found four species of GPI glycans and verified them by MS/MS spectra (Fig. 3, A–C, and Table S3). Next we investigated the percentage of each GPI glycan species. For this, peak intensities of each fragment were calculated from the MS spectra (Fig. S1B). We revealed that core + N-acetylhexosamine (HexNAc) + hexose (Hex), core + HexNAc + Hex + Hex, core + HexNAc + Hex + Neu5Ac, and core + HexNAc + Hex + Neu5Ac + Hex were present at 34.5%, 37.7%, 17.4%, and 10.4%, respectively (Fig. 3D and Table S3; HexNAc and Hex are GalNAc and Gal or fourth Man, respectively). The peptides corresponding to core only, core + HexNAc, and core + Hex were not detected (Fig. 3D and Table S3). These results indicate that almost all of the GPI anchor of human PrPC is modified by a GalNAc side chain and that at least 60% of the GPI anchor is elongated by Gal and 25% is further elongated by Neu5Ac in the mouse brain. We did not find N-glycolylneuraminic acid–containing GPI, probably because of very low levels of N-glycolylneuraminic acid in vertebrate brains (29Davies L.R. Pearce O.M. Tessier M.B. Assar S. Smutova V. Pajunen M. Sumida M. Sato C. Kitajima K. Finne J. Gagneux P. Pshezhetsky A. Woods R. Varki A.

Next, to determine the linkage type of a Neu5Ac in the human PrPC GPI anchor, we used a linkage-specific chemical derivatization approach, SALSA (30Nishikaze T. Tsumoto H. Sekiya S. Iwamoto S. Miura Y. Tanaka K. Differentiation of sialyl linkage isomers by one-pot sialic acid derivatization for mass spectrometry-based glycan profiling.Anal.

Chem. 2018; 90 (30335964): 13193-1319910.1021/acs.analchem.8b02775Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). SALSA converts carboxyl groups in Sia residues into alkylamide forms with different alkyl chain lengths in a linkage-specific manner, allowing direct discrimination of the α2,3 linkage type from the α2,6 linkage type by MS. To suppress unfavorable by-products during SALSA reactions, free amine groups were capped by dimethyl labeling (DML) prior to SALSA reactions. After DML and SALSA treatments, the derivatized sample was measured in negative ion mode MALDI-MS. There are mainly four glycoforms at m/z 1630.5−, m/z 1792.5−, m/z 1934.6−, and m/z 2096.6− in human PrPC (Fig. 4, A and B, and Fig. S2, A–C). The peaks at m/z 1630.5− and 1792.5− correspond to nonsialylated GPI anchor glycopeptides (Fig. 4B). The peaks at m/z 1934.6− and 2096.6− correspond to sialylated GPI anchor glycopeptides, which include a methylamidated Neu5Ac residue (304 Da) (Fig. 4B). This indicates that the linkage type of a Neu5Ac residue is α2,3-linked, not α2,6-linked. Structural analysis by MS/MS supports these assignments (see Fig. 4C and Fig. S2, A–C for MS/MS spectra). We could not identify GPI species without HexNAc (m/z 1427−) or Hex and HexNAc (m/z 1265−) because of dense peaks of foreign substances (HexNAc, GalNAc; Hex, fourth Man). Accompanying signals, including −28, −14, and +14 Da, were by-products attributable to incomplete or additional DML reactions (MS/MS data were not shown). Signals of +25 Da also seemed to be by-products, but their structures and origins were not identified because of unexpected reactions. Although these by-product signals were detected, the main signals with Δm = 304 Da clearly indicated the presence of α2,3-linked Neu5Ac. Finally, we determined GPI-glycan structures of PrPC isolated from a human brain. Deglycosylated and delipidated PrPC was prepared by PNG-F and PI-PLC treatments, followed by affinity purification as described above. Trypsinized samples were analyzed by LC-ESI-MS (Table S4). Similar to the results for human PrPC from KI mice, the C-terminal glycopeptide corresponding to Gly229 GPI glycan, but not Gly229-Ser230 GPI glycan, was detected, confirming that Gly229 was indeed the ω site of human PrPC (Table S5; raw data are available from PRIDE). We again detected four kinds of GPI glycans, core + HexNAc + Hex, core + HexNAc + Hex + Hex, core + HexNAc + Hex + Neu5Ac, and core + HexNAc + Hex + Neu5Ac + Hex, in the human brain sample (see Fig. 5, A and B, for MS/MS spectra). The percentages of these species were 8.5%, 50.3%, 1.4%, and 39.8%, respectively (Fig. 5C and Table S5). This indicates that almost all GPI in human brain PrPC is modified by a GalNAc side chain; 90% of the GalNAc side chain is further elongated by Gal, and 40% of the GalNAc side chain has Gal-Neu5Ac elongation. These results also indicate that 90% of GPI in the human brain PrPC contains a fourth Man. Taken together, we conclude that the ω site of human PrPC is Gly229 and that the majority of human brain PrPC contains a fourth Man and a galactosylated GalNAc side chain with or without Neu5Ac modification. Here we determined the GPI glycan structures of human PrPC, including the Sia linkage type. The GPI Sia linkage type was unknown for any GPI-APs. We took advantage of KI mice expressing human PrPC in place of mouse PrPC and the SALSA method. In general, analysis of Sia-containing glycans by MS is difficult because of low ionization and chemical instability. We employed the SALSA method to enhance detection of Sia and to determine the linkage types. We demonstrated that Sia in the human PrPC GPI anchor is Neu5Ac linked to Gal via α2,3 linkage (Fig. 4). Intriguingly, the GPI side-chain structure, NeuNAcα2–3Galβ1–3GalNAcβ1-, is exactly the same as a partial structure of GD1a, a product of sialylation of GM1a ganglioside (32Schnaar R.L. Gangliosides of the vertebrate nervous system.J. Mol. Biol. 2016; 428 (27261254): 3325-333610.1016/j.jmb.2016.05.020Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar).

However, cytokine release syndrome (CRS) remains a risk. CRS is characterized by the excessive activation of CAR T cells and macrophages. Signs and symptoms of CRS are usually resolved after steroid administration, but steroids abrogate the expansion and persistence of CAR T cell populations. Tocilizumab is a humanized monoclonal antibody (mAb) that attenuates CRS without significant loss of CAR T cell activity. However, interleukin-6 (IL-6)/IL-6 receptor (IL-6R) blockade alone cannot relieve CRS symptoms fully, and novel treatments are needed to prevent or cure CRS. TO-207 is an N-benzoyl-L-phenylalanine derivative that significantly inhibits inflammatory cytokine production in human monocyte and macrophage-specific manner. We investigated whether TO-207 could inhibit cytokine production without impairing CAR T cell function in a CRS-simulating co-culture system."
https://openalex.org/W3017078513,"Here we provide bioinformatic evidence that the Organo-Arsenical Exporter (ArsP), Endoplasmic Reticulum Retention Receptor (KDELR), Mitochondrial Pyruvate Carrier (MPC), L-Alanine Exporter (AlaE), and the Lipid-linked Sugar Translocase (LST) protein families are members of the Transporter-Opsin-G Protein-coupled Receptor (TOG) Superfamily. These families share domains homologous to well-established TOG superfamily members, and their topologies of transmembranal segments (TMSs) are compatible with the basic 4-TMS repeat unit characteristic of this Superfamily. These repeat units tend to occur twice in proteins as a result of intragenic duplication events, often with subsequent gain/loss of TMSs in many superfamily members. Transporters within the ArsP family allow microbial pathogens to expel toxic arsenic compounds from the cell. Members of the KDELR family are involved in the selective retrieval of proteins that reside in the endoplasmic reticulum. Proteins of the MPC family are involved in the transport of pyruvate into mitochondria, providing the organelle with a major oxidative fuel. Members of family AlaE excrete L-alanine from the cell. Members of the LST family are involved in the translocation of lipid-linked glucose across the membrane. These five families substantially expand the range of substrates of transport carriers in the superfamily, although KDEL receptors have no known transport function. Clustering of protein sequences reveals the relationships among families, and the resulting tree correlates well with the degrees of sequence similarity documented between families. The analyses and programs developed to detect distant relatedness, provide insights into the structural, functional, and evolutionary relationships that exist between families of the TOG superfamily, and should be of value to many other investigators."
https://openalex.org/W3017093892,"The goal of this research was to evaluate the microclimate (temperature, relative humidity and ECI–enthalpy comfort index) of commercial loads of broiler chickens at different transport distances: Dist15 (15 km on average) and Dist90 (90 km on average) in the summer and winter seasons and their effects on the production parameters body weight difference (BWD), mortality (%) and bruising prevalence (%). Twelve broiler loads were monitored using dataloggers to record temperature and humidity, with a total of 24 target crates per load. The experiment followed a factorial design [2 seasons (rainy and dry) × 2 distances (Dist15 and Dist90)] with a randomized complete block arrangement, 3 sexes (all males, all females, or mixed shipments) and one shipment per combination. BWD had a heterogeneous distribution throughout the load, and this distribution was not significantly correlated with the mean ECI measured during transport at 12 positions along the load. In terms of comfort, summer is the most critical period for broiler transport. In the interaction between rainy season and Dist90, the highest ECI was scored in the lethal zone (where physiological mechanisms are not enough to control body temperature). Mortality during the rainy season was not significantly different between distances. However, during the dry season, mortality was twice as high as broilers that travelled for 15 km. The prevalence of bruising on carcasses was not affected by the interaction between season and distance. As we know, broiler chicken performance, during transport, can be also related to road conditions, being hard to evaluate the real impact of seasons and distances on animal welfare. Load microclimate can compromise broiler chicken welfare during transport and it does not necessary reflect significant losses pre and post-slaughter."

Participants were recruited using systematic random sampling technique and screened with HBsAg Rapid Test. Data was analyzed with the aid of Statistical Package for Social Sciences (SPSS), version 23.0. Results were presented using descriptive statistics, Fisher's Exact test and Logistic Regression analysis.Two hundred and twenty-one (221) of the total sample (n = 232) agreed to participate in this study; representing a response rate of 95%. The mean age of the participants was 31 years and standard deviation of 5.3. The mean gestational period at recruitment was 28 weeks and standard deviation of 6.8. Majority of the participants were married (83.3%), parous (69.6%), educated (91.4%) and employed (90.5%). The prevalence of HBsAg was 7.7%. We found no significant association between socio-demographic characteristics of the participants and HBV infection.Seroprevalence of 7.7% indicates moderate endemicity.

https://openalex.org/W3016313710,"The prognosis for people with the high-grade brain tumor glioblastoma is very poor, due largely to low cell death in response to genotoxic therapy. The transcription factor BCL6, a protein that normally suppresses the DNA damage response during immune cell maturation, and a known driver of B-cell lymphoma, was shown to mediate the survival of glioblastoma cells. Expression was observed in glioblastoma tumor specimens and cell lines. When BCL6 expression or activity was reduced in these lines, increased apoptosis and a profound loss of proliferation was observed, consistent with gene expression signatures suggestive of anti-apoptotic and pro-survival signaling role for BCL6 in glioblastoma. Further, treatment with the standard therapies for glioblastoma-ionizing radiation and temozolomide-both induced BCL6 expression in vitro, and an in vivo orthotopic animal model of glioblastoma. Importantly, inhibition of BCL6 in combination with genotoxic therapies enhanced the therapeutic effect. Together these data demonstrate that BCL6 is an active transcription factor in glioblastoma, that it drives survival of cells, and that it increased with DNA damage, which increased the survival rate of therapy-treated cells. This makes BCL6 an excellent therapeutic target in glioblastoma-by increasing sensitivity to standard DNA damaging therapy, BCL6 inhibitors have real potential to improve the outcome for people with this disease."
https://openalex.org/W3016854463,"Due to their cartilaginous endoskeleton and the continuous tooth replacement, the chondrichthyan fossil record predominantly consists of isolated teeth, which offer diagnostic features for taxonomic identifications, but only provide very limited information of an organism’s life history. In contrast, the calcified vertebral centra of elasmobranchs (sharks, skates and rays) yield important information about ecological and biological traits that can be utilized for constructing age-structured population dynamic models of extant species and palaeoecological reconstructions of such aspects in extinct groups. Here, we describe two large shark vertebrae from the Santonian (Upper Cretaceous) of Spain, which show a unique combination of characters (asterospondylic calcification pattern, with concentric lamellae and numerous parallel bands that are oriented perpendicular) that is only known from ptychodontid sharks, a distinct, extinct group of giant durophagous sharks of the Cretaceous era. Based on linear regression models for large extant sharks a total length between 430 and 707cm was estimated for the examined specimen. Our results indicate that ptychodontid sharks were large viviparous animals, with slow growth rates, matured very late and, therefore, show typical traits for K-selected species. These traits combined with a highly specialized feeding ecology might have played a crucial role for the success but also, eventually, extinction of this group."
https://openalex.org/W3017078989,"The development of Web 2.0 and the rapid growth of available data have led to the development of systems, such as recommendation systems (RSs), that can handle the information overload. However, RS performance is severely limited by sparsity and cold-start problems. Thus, this paper aims to alleviate these problems. To realize this objective, a new model is proposed by integrating three sources of information: a user-item matrix, explicit and implicit relationships. The core strategy of this study is to use the multi-step resource allocation (MSRA) method to identify hidden relations in social information. First, explicit social information is used to compute the similarity between each pair of users. Second, for each non-friend pair of users, the MSRA method is applied to determine the probability of their relation. If the probability exceeds a threshold, a new relationship will be established. Then, all sources are incorporated into the Singular Value Decomposition (SVD) method to compute the missing prediction values. Furthermore, the stochastic gradient descent technique is applied to optimize the training process. Additionally, two real datasets, namely, Last.Fm and Ciao, are utilized to evaluate the proposed method. In terms of accuracy, the experiment results demonstrate that the proposed method outperforms eight state-of-the-art approaches: Heats, PMF, SVD, SR, EISR-JC, EISR-CN, EISR-PA and EISR-RAI."
https://openalex.org/W3016553824,"There is a strong and continuously growing interest in using large electronic healthcare databases to study health outcomes and the effects of pharmaceutical products. However, concerns regarding disease misclassification (i.e. classification errors of the disease status) and its impact on the study results are legitimate. Validation is therefore increasingly recognized as an essential component of database research. In this work, we elucidate the interrelations between the true prevalence of a disease in a database population (i.e. prevalence assuming no disease misclassification), the observed prevalence subject to disease misclassification, and the most common validity indices: sensitivity, specificity, positive and negative predictive value. Based on this, we obtained analytical expressions to derive all the validity indices and true prevalence from the observed prevalence and any combination of two other parameters. The analytical expressions can be used for various purposes. Most notably, they can be used to obtain an estimate of the observed prevalence adjusted for outcome misclassification from any combination of two validity indices and to derive validity indices from each other which would otherwise be difficult to obtain. To allow researchers to easily use the analytical expressions, we additionally developed a user-friendly and freely available web-application."
https://openalex.org/W3016638022,"Objective Interference with the transmission of sensory signals along visual and auditory pathways has been implicated in the pathogenesis of hallucinations. The relay centres for vision (the lateral geniculate nucleus) and hearing (the medial geniculate nucleus) appear to be susceptible to the uptake of circulating mercury. We therefore investigated the distribution of mercury in cells of both these geniculate nuclei. Materials and methods Paraffin-embedded tissue sections containing the lateral geniculate nucleus were obtained from 50 adults (age range 20–104 years) who at autopsy had a variety of clinicopathological conditions, including neurological and psychiatric disorders. The medial geniculate nucleus was present in seven sections. Sections were stained for mercury using autometallography. Laser ablation-inductively coupled plasma-mass spectrometry was used to confirm the presence of mercury. Results Ten people had mercury in cells of the lateral geniculate nucleus, and in the medial geniculate nucleus of three of these. Medical diagnoses in these individuals were: none (3), Parkinson disease (3), and one each of depression, bipolar disorder, multiple sclerosis, and mercury self-injection. Mercury was distributed in different groups of geniculate capillary endothelial cells, neurons, oligodendrocytes, and astrocytes. Mass spectrometry confirmed the presence of mercury. Conclusion Mercury is present in different combinations of cell types in the lateral and medial geniculate nuclei in a proportion of people from varied backgrounds. This raises the possibility that mercury-induced impairment of the function of the geniculate nuclei could play a part in the genesis of visual and auditory hallucinations. Although these findings do not provide a direct link between mercury in geniculate cells and hallucinations, they suggest that further investigations into the possibility of toxicant-induced hallucinations are warranted."

The aim of this study was to screen for polymorphism in the equine LGB1 and LGB2 gene sequences (all exons, introns, and 5'-flanking region) and to assess potential relationship of particular genotypes with gene expression levels (measured in milk somatic cells) and milk composition traits (protein, fat, lactose, and total β-lactoglobulin content). Direct DNA sequencing analysis was performed for twelve horse breeds: Polish Primitive Horse (PPH), Polish Coldblood Horse (PCH), Polish Warmblood Horse (PWH), Silesian, Hucul, Fjording, Haflinger, Shetland Pony, Welsh Pony, Arabian, Thoroughbred, and Percheron-and revealed the presence of 83 polymorphic sites (47 and 36 for LGB1 and LGB2 genes, respectively), including eight that were previously unknown. Association analysis of the selected polymorphisms, gene expression, and milk composition traits (conducted for the PPH, PCH, and PWH breeds) showed several statistically significant relationships; for example, the two linked LGB1 SNPs (rs1143515669 and rs1144647991) were associated with total milk protein content (p < 0.01). Our study also confirmed that horse breed had significant impact on both gene transcript levels (p < 0.01) and on milk LGB content (p < 0.05), whereas an influence of lactation period was seen only for gene relative mRNA abundances (p < 0.01)."
https://openalex.org/W3016420485,"Environmental mold (fungus) exposure poses a significant threat to public health by causing illnesses ranging from invasive fungal diseases in immune compromised individuals to allergic hypertensive diseases such as asthma and asthma exacerbation in otherwise healthy people. However, the molecular pathogenesis has not been completely understood, and treatment options are limited. Due to its thermo-tolerance to the normal human body temperature, Aspergillus. fumigatus (A.fumigatus) is one of the most important human pathogens to cause different lung fungal diseases including fungal asthma. Airway obstruction and hyperresponsiveness caused by mucus overproduction are the hallmarks of many A.fumigatus induced lung diseases. To understand the underlying molecular mechanism, we have utilized a well-established A.fumigatus extracts (AFE) model to elucidate downstream signal pathways that mediate A.fumigatus induced mucin production in airway epithelial cells. AFE was found to stimulate time- and dose-dependent increase of major airway mucin gene expression (MUC5AC and MUC5B) partly via the elevation of their promoter activities. We also demonstrated that EGFR was required but not sufficient for AFE-induced mucin expression, filling the paradoxical gap from a previous study using the same model. Furthermore, we showed that fungal proteases in AFE were responsible for mucin induction by activating a Ras/Raf1/ERK signaling pathway. Ca2+ signaling, but ROS, both of which were stimulated by fungal proteases, was an indispensable determinant for ERK activation and mucin induction. The discovery of this novel pathway likely contributes to our understanding of the pathogenesis of fungal sensitization in allergic diseases such as fungal asthma."

Under-sampling or over-sampling dynamic PET images induces significant variations on kinetic parameters quantification. We aimed to optimize temporal time frame binning for dynamic FDOPA PET imaging. Methods Fourteen patients with 33 tumoral TAC with biopsy-proven gliomas were analysed. The mean SUVmax tumor-to-brain ratio (TBRmax) were compared at 20 min and 35 min post-injection (p.i). Five different time frame samplings within 20 min were compared: 11x10sec-6x15sec-5x20sec-3x300sec; 8x15sec– 2x30sec– 2x60sec– 3x300sec; 6x20sec– 8x60sec– 2x300sec; 10x30sec– 3x300sec and 4x45sec– 3x90sec– 5x150sec. The reversible single-tissue compartment model with blood volume parameter (VB) was selected using the Akaike information criterion. K1 values extracted from 1024 noisy simulated TAC using Monte Carlo method from the 5 different time samplings were compared to a target K1 value as the objective, which is the average of the K1 values extracted from the 33 lesions using an imaging-derived input function for each patient. Results The mean TBRmax was significantly higher at 20 min p.i. than at 35 min p.i (respectively 1.4 +/- 0.8 and 1.2 +/- 0.6; p <0.001). The target K1 value was 0.161 mL/ccm/min. The 8x15sec– 2x30sec– 2x60sec– 3x300sec time sampling was the optimal time frame binning. K1 values extracted using this optimal time frame binning were significantly different with K1 values extracted from the other time frame samplings, except with K1 values obtained using the 11x10sec– 6x15sec –5x20sec-3x300sec time frame binning. Conclusions This optimal sampling schedule design (8x15sec– 2x30sec– 2x60sec– 3x300sec) could be used to minimize bias in quantification of FDOPA uptake in glioma using kinetic analysis."

Furthermore, this paper analyzes three types of distribution channels strategy in the context of how they influence a manufacturer’s product quality decision and quality prevention strategy, a retailer’s product pricing decision and quality inspection strategy, and the final customer’s product demand decision. We compare the manufacturer’s product quality level, quality prevention effort level, wholesale price, direct sale price and the retailer’s quality inspection effort level, retail price in three types of distribution channels and determine the manufacturer’s and retailer’s expected profits function and the final customer’s consumer surplus. In addition, we introduce the distribution channels demand elasticity ratio to analyze the influence of determining the product quality control strategy. Most importantly, we conduct a numerical sample analysis that will prove the model’s effectiveness and indicate a specific application in practice."

This study was undertaken to determine if there is greater corneal nerve damage in patients with recurrent ischemic stroke. Methods Corneal confocal microscopy (CCM) was used to quantify corneal nerve fiber density (CNFD), corneal nerve branch density (CNBD), corneal nerve fiber length (CNFL) and corneal nerve fiber tortuosity (CNFT) in 31 patients with recurrent ischemic stroke, 165 patients with a first acute ischemic stroke and 23 healthy control subjects. Results Triglycerides (P = 0.004, P = 0.017), systolic BP (P = 0.000, P = 0.000), diastolic BP (P = 0.000, P = 0.000) and HbA1c (P = 0.000, P = 0.000) were significantly higher in patients with first and recurrent stroke compared to controls. There was no difference in age, BMI, HbA1c, total cholesterol, triglycerides, LDL, HDL, systolic and diastolic BP between patients with a first and recurrent ischemic stroke. However, CNFD was significantly lower (24.98±7.31 vs 29.07±7.58 vs 37.91±7.13, P<0.05) and CNFT was significantly higher (0.085±0.042 vs 0.064±0.037 vs 0.039±0.022, P<0.05) in patients with recurrent stroke compared to first stroke and healthy controls. CNBD (42.21±24.65 vs 50.46±27.68 vs 87.24±45.85, P<0.001) and CNFL (15.66±5.70, P<0.001 vs 17.38±5.06, P = 0.003) were equally reduced in patients with first and recurrent stroke compared to controls (22.72±5.14). Conclusions Corneal confocal microscopy identified greater corneal nerve fibre loss in patients with recurrent stroke compared to patients with first stroke, despite comparable risk factors. Longitudinal studies are required to determine the prognostic utility of corneal nerve fiber loss in identifying patients at risk of recurrent ischemic stroke."

Our results showed that the lifespans of the N2, sod-3 and sod-5 mutant strains were extended by approximately 22.7%, 9.5%, and 8.7%, respectively, after hydrogen treatment, but hydrogen had no effect on the lifespans of the daf-2 and daf-16 mutant strains. Meanwhile, the level of reactive oxygen species (ROS) in the hydrogen treatment group was significantly lower than that in the control group. At the transcript level, the expression of age-1 and let-363 was obviously decreased, while the expression of ins-18 was increased at the same time point (14 d). Compared with the control group, paraquat (PQ) could reduce the lifespan of the N2 and sod-5 mutant strains. Importantly, the longevity of these mutant strains recovered to normal levels when the animals were treated with exogenous hydrogen. According to these results, the lifespan of C. elegans is closely related to oxidative stress and can be significantly prolonged by reducing oxidative stress damage. Taken together, our data showed that hydrogen is a valuable antioxidant that can significantly reduce the body's ROS levels and extend the lifespan of C. elegans. This study also laid a foundation for the subsequent application of hydrogen in antiaging studies."
https://openalex.org/W3017253262,"Auxin signalling is vital for plant growth and development, from embryogenesis to senescence. Recent studies have shown that auxin regulates biological processes by mediating gene expression through a family of functionally original DNA-binding auxin response factors, which exist in a large multi-gene family in plants. However, to date, no information has been available about characteristics of the ARF gene family in Brassica juncea var. tumida. In this study, 65 B. juncea genes that encode ARF proteins were identified in the B. juncea whole-genome, classified into three phylogenetical groups and found to be widely and randomly distributed in the A-and B-genome. Highly conserved proteins were also found within each ortholog based on gene structure and conserved motifs, as well as clustering level. Furthermore, promoter cis-element analysis of BjARFs demonstrated that these genes affect the levels of plant hormones, such as auxin, salicylic, gibberellin acid, MeJA, abscisic acid, and ethylene. Expression analysis showed that differentially expressed BjARF genes were detected during the seedling stage, tumor stem development and the flowering period of B. juncea. Interestingly, we found that BjARF2b_A, BjARF3b_A, BjARF6b_A, and BjARF17a_B were significantly expressed in tumor stem, and an exogenous auxin assay indicated that these genes were sensitive to auxin and IAA signaling. Moreover, eight of the nine BjARF10/16/17 genes and all of the BjARF6/8 genes were involved in post-transcriptional regulation, targeted by Bj-miR160 and Bj-miR167c, respectively. This analysis provides deeper insight of diversification for ARFs and will facilitate further dissection of ARF gene function in B. juncea."
https://openalex.org/W3017384785,"China is emerging as an increasingly important player in the global development space, but may be less bound to compacts that aim to curb political preferencing and therefore may produce less yield in terms of impact toward Sustainable Development Goals. This research tests the hypothesis that the disproportionate aid allocation to the birth regions of the current African political leaders that applies to some sectors more than others.We applied a two-part model to first estimate the probability that a region receives an aid project. Then when at least one aid project is present in a leader's birth region, we estimated the mean amount of aid the region received.This analysis covers 699 subnational units (first administrative level) across 44 African countries over 2000-2014. These administrative units were compiled into a region year panel resulting in 10,485 observations.Birth regions of the current political leader are significantly more likely than the average of all of the regions to receive education (1.3 percentage points), social infrastructure and services (1.2 percentage points), and energy aid (1.7 percentage points). No significant association was found between aid flows to the birth region of the current political leader in the agriculture, communication, education, government, health or transportation sectors. Within the education sector, the coefficients for birth region are positive in both parts and statistically significant. Both the probability of aid allocation and the amount of aid conditional on any projects increase in the birth region of the current political leader.This sector-specific analysis provides a more nuanced picture of Chinese aid than previous analyses that determine the presence of political preference according to aggregate aid flows. The sectors where political preferencing exists are also those sectors that are typically associated with limited counterfactual-based program evaluation. We present evidence that demonstrates the importance of disaggregating aid flows in order to support a new policy framework designed to target the Sustainable Development Goals."
https://openalex.org/W3016882878,"Nasopharyngeal (NP) colonization with antimicrobial-resistant bacteria is a global public health concern. Antimicrobial-resistance (AMR) genes carried by the resident NP microbiota may serve as a reservoir for transfer of resistance elements to opportunistic pathogens. Little is known about the NP antibiotic resistome. This study longitudinally investigated the composition of the NP antibiotic resistome in Streptococcus-enriched samples in a South African birth cohort.As a proof of concept study, 196 longitudinal NP samples were retrieved from a subset of 23 infants enrolled as part of broader birth cohort study. These were selected on the basis of changes in serotype and antibiogram over time. NP samples underwent short-term enrichment for streptococci prior to total nucleic acid extraction and whole metagenome shotgun sequencing (WMGS). Reads were assembled and aligned to pneumococcal reference genomes for the extraction of streptococcal and non-streptococcal bacterial reads. Contigs were aligned to the Antibiotic Resistance Gene-ANNOTation database of acquired AMR genes.AMR genes were detected in 64% (125/196) of the samples. A total of 329 AMR genes were detected, including 36 non-redundant genes, ranging from 1 to 14 genes per sample. The predominant AMR genes detected encoded resistance mechanisms to beta-lactam (52%, 172/329), macrolide-lincosamide-streptogramin (17%, 56/329), and tetracycline antibiotics (12%, 38/329). MsrD, ermB, and mefA genes were only detected from streptococcal reads. The predominant genes detected from non- streptococcal reads included blaOXA-60, blaOXA-22, and blaBRO-1. Different patterns of carriage of AMR genes were observed, with only one infant having a stable carriage of mefA, msrD and tetM over a long period.This study demonstrates that WMGS can provide a broad snapshot of the NP resistome and has the potential to provide a comprehensive assessment of resistance elements present in this niche."
https://openalex.org/W3016879369,"Countries in Sub-Saharan Africa (SSA) have seen rapid increases in injection drug use since 2008. In Uganda, the Global Sate of Harm report and studies conducted by Makerere University Crane Surveys have estimated HIV prevalence among people who inject drugs (PWID) at approximately 17%. The objective of the research was to document injection and other drug-related risks among people who use drugs in Uganda to develop comprehensive HIV/HCV prevention interventions.Between August and September 2018, we conducted qualitative interviews among male and female people who use drugs. Interview topics included the availability and accessibility of clean syringes, injection risks, overdose, sexual-risk behaviors, and the availability and accessibility of harm reduction and drug treatment services.Participants reported several injection-related risks including sharing and reusing syringes, pooling and mixing drugs in the same container, measuring drugs using syringes, getting prefilled injections from dealers, being injected by other people who inject drugs, and using contaminated water or blood to dilute drugs. Participants reported a scarcity of harm reduction services, although a few appear to have participated in the syringe exchange pilot conducted by the Uganda Harm Reduction Network (UHRN). Even fewer reported knowing organizations that helped people who use drugs abstain from or reduce their use. Medication assisted therapy (MAT) and naloxone to reverse overdoses are not currently available.Comprehensive prevention and treatment services are needed in Uganda and should include expanded syringe exchange programs, social network HIV testing, HCV testing, provision of naloxone and MAT, and linkage to and retention in HIV care."
https://openalex.org/W3017121788,"In the United States (US), long-term opioid therapy has been commonly prescribed for chronic pain. Since recognition of the opioid overdose epidemic, clinical practice guidelines have recommended tapering long-term opioids to reduced doses or discontinuation. The Effects of Prescription Opioid Changes for veterans (EPOCH) study is a national population-based prospective observational study of US Veterans Health Administration primary care patients designed to assess effects of evolving opioid prescribing practice on patients treated with long-term opioids for chronic pain. A stratified random sampling design was used to identify a survey sample from the target population of patients treated with opioid analgesics for ≥ 6 months. Demographic, diagnostic, visit, and pharmacy dispensing data were extracted from existing datasets. A 2016 mixed-mode mail and telephone survey collected patient-reported data, including the main patient-reported outcomes of pain-related function (Brief Pain Inventory interference; BPI-I scores 0-10, higher scores = worse) and health-related quality of life. Data on survey participants and non-participants were analyzed to assess potential nonresponse bias. Weights were used to account for design. Linear regression models were used to assess cross-sectional associations of opioid treatment with patient-reported measures. Of 14,160 patients contacted, 9253 (65.4%) completed the survey. Participants were older than non-participants (63.9 ± 10.6 vs. 59.6 ± 13.0 years). The mean number of bothersome pain locations was 6.8 (SE 0.04). Effectiveness of pain treatment and quality of pain care were rated fair or poor by 56.1% and 45.3%, respectively. The opioid daily dosage range was 1.6 to 1038.2 mg, with mean = 50.6 mg (SE 1.1) and median = 30.9 mg (IQR 40.7). Among the 73.2% of patients who did not receive long-acting opioids, the mean daily dosage was 30.4 mg (SE 0.6) and mean BPI-I was 6.4 (SE 00.4). Among patients who received long-acting opioids, the mean daily dosage was 106.2 mg (SE 2.8) and mean BPI-I was 6.8 (SE 0.07). Higher daily dosage was associated with worse pain-related function and quality of life among patients without long-acting opioids, but not among patients with long-acting opioids. Future analyses will use follow-up data to examine effects of opioid dose reduction and discontinuation on patient outcomes."
https://openalex.org/W3016440958,"Background Of the total 56 million deaths worldwide during 2012, 38 million (68%) were due to noncommunicable diseases (NCDs), particularly cardiovascular diseases (17.5 million deaths) cancers (8.2 million) which represents46.2% and 21.7% of NCD deaths, respectively). Nearly 80 percent of the global CVD deaths occur in low- and middle-income countries. Some of the major CVDs such as ischemic heart disease (IHD) and stroke and CVD risk conditions, namely, hypertension and dyslipidaemia share common modifiable risk factors including smoking, unhealthy diets, harmful use of alcohol and physical inactivity. The CVDs are now putting a heavy strain of the health systems at both national and local levels, which have previously largely focused on infectious diseases and appalling maternal and child health. We set out to estimate district-level co-occurrence of two cardiovascular diseases (CVDs), namely, ischemic heart disease (IHD) and stroke; and two major risk conditions for CVD, namely, hypertension and dyslipidaemia in South Africa. Method The analyses were based on adults health collected as part of the 2012 South African National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (SANHANES). We used joint disease mapping models to estimate and map the spatial distributions of risks of hypertension, self-report of ischaemic heart disease (IHD), stroke and dyslipidaemia at the district level in South Africa. The analyses were adjusted for known individual social demographic and lifestyle factors, household and district level poverty measurements using binary spatial models. Results The estimated prevalence of IHD, stroke, hypertension and dyslipidaemia revealed high inequality at the district level (median value (range): 5.4 (0–17.8%); 1.7 (0–18.2%); 32.0 (12.5–48.2%) and 52.2 (0–71.7%), respectively). The adjusted risks of stroke, hypertension and IHD were mostly high in districts in the South-Eastern parts of the country, while that of dyslipidaemia, was high in Central and top North-Eastern corridor of the country. Conclusions The study has confirmed common modifiable risk factors of two cardiovascular diseases (CVDs), namely, ischemic heart disease (IHD) and stroke; and two major risk conditions for CVD, namely, hypertension and dyslipidaemia. Accordingly, an integrated intervention approach addressing cardiovascular diseases and associated risk factors and conditions would be more cost effective and provide stronger impacts than individual tailored interventions only. Findings of excess district-level variations in the CVDs and their risk factor profiles might be useful for developing effective public health policies and interventions aimed at reducing behavioural risk factors including harmful use of alcohol, physical inactivity and high salt intake."
https://openalex.org/W3016622671,"Severely damaged adult zebrafish extraocular muscles (EOMs) regenerate through dedifferentiation of residual myocytes involving a muscle-to-mesenchyme transition. Members of the Twist family of basic helix-loop-helix transcription factors (TFs) are key regulators of the epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) and are also involved in craniofacial development in humans and animal models. During zebrafish embryogenesis, twist family members (twist1a, twist1b, twist2, and twist3) function to regulate craniofacial skeletal development. Because of their roles as master regulators of stem cell biology, we hypothesized that twist TFs regulate adult EOM repair and regeneration. In this study, utilizing an adult zebrafish EOM regeneration model, we demonstrate that inhibiting twist3 function using translation-blocking morpholino oligonucleotides (MOs) impairs muscle regeneration by reducing myocyte dedifferentiation and proliferation in the regenerating muscle. This supports our hypothesis that twist TFs are involved in the early steps of dedifferentiation and highlights the importance of twist3 during EOM regeneration."
https://openalex.org/W3017311780,"Oxidative stress may cause ocular surface damage during the development of dry eye. Mammalian cells have defense systems against oxidative stress. A central regulator of the stress response is nuclear factor-erythroid 2-related factor 2 (NFE2L2). NFE2L2 is activated by the novel triterpenoid RS9 (a biotransformation compound of RTA 402). The purpose of this study was to assess the efficacy of RS9 against dry eye using in vitro and in vivo models. Bioactivity was estimated by the induction of mRNAs for two NFE2L2-targeted genes: NQO1 (prevents radical species) and GCLC (glutathione synthesis), using a corneal epithelial cell line (HCE-T). Protection against oxidation and cell damage was tested in vitro by culturing cells under hyperosmotic stress or by the addition of menadione, a generator of reactive oxygen species (ROS). Dry eye in vivo was induced by the injection of scopolamine into rats. Then, 930 nM of RS9 was applied to both eyes for 2 weeks. Oxidative stress was measured by the accumulation of 8-hydroxy-2’-deoxyguanosine (8-OHdG). Corneal wound healing was measured by scoring for superficial punctate keratitis (SPK). Corneal epithelial cell densities were evaluated histologically. RS9 and RTA 402 induced the expression of NQO1 and GCLC mRNAs in HCE-T cells. And both compounds suppressed hyperosmotic-ROS generation and menadione induced cellular damage. However RS9 had a stronger protective effect than RTA 402. Ocular instillation of RS9 also significantly upregulated the expression of Nqo1 mRNA in the corneal epithelium. Accumulation of 8-OHdG, increase of SPK scores and decrement of basal cell density were observed in corneal epithelium from scopolamine-injected rats. These changes were significantly ameliorated by the topical administration of RS9. RS9 induced Nfe2l2 activation and Nfe2l2-targeted genes, reduced oxidation, and ameliorated symptoms of dry eye using in vitro and in vivo models. Thus, RS9 might be a potent candidate agent against dry eye disease."
https://openalex.org/W3019465353,"The erythropoietin-producing human hepatocellular receptor EPH receptor B6 (EPHB6) is a receptor tyrosine kinase that has been shown previously to control catecholamine synthesis in the adrenal gland chromaffin cells (AGCCs) in a testosterone-dependent fashion.

Using amperometry recordings, we now found that catecholamine secretion by AGCCs is compromised in the absence of EPHB6. AGCCs from male knockout (KO) mice displayed reduced cortical F-actin disassembly, accompanied by decreased catecholamine secretion through exocytosis. This phenotype was not observed in AGCCs from female KO mice, suggesting that testosterone, but not estrogen, contributes to this phenotype. Of note, reverse signaling from EPHB6 to ephrin B1 (EFNB1) and a 7-amino acid-long segment in the EFNB1 intracellular tail were essential for the regulation of catecholamine secretion.

We discuss the implications of EPHB6's effect on catecholamine exocytosis and secretion for blood pressure regulation. Erythropoietin-producing human hepatocellular receptors (EPH) are the largest family of receptor tyrosine kinases.

EPHs are classified into A and B subfamilies based on their sequence homology. EFNs are also categorized into A and B subfamilies, based on the way they anchor on the cell membrane. EFNAs attach to the cell membrane by a glycosylphosphatidylinositol linkage, and they are without intracellular tails. EFNBs are transmembrane molecules. EPH and EFN interact promiscuously, but generally speaking, EPHAs preferably interact with EFNAs, and EFPBs with EFNBs (2Pasquale E.B.

Accordingly, AGCCs from male EPHB6 KO mice have a lower CAT content, caused by a reduced level of tyrosine hydroxylase (24Shi W. Wang Y. Peng J. Qi S. Vitale N. Kaneda N. Murata T. Luo H. Wu J. EPHB6 controls catecholamine biosynthesis by up-regulating tyrosine hydroxylase transcription in adrenal gland chromaffin cells.J. Biol.

In this study, we assessed whether EPHB6 KO affected CAT exocytosis and studied underlying mechanisms. Our previous study has shown a reduction of 24-h urine CAT levels in EPHB6 KO male but not female mice. To prove that such reduction was due to decreased CAT secretion by AGCCs, we conducted amperometry to assess CAT release by individual AGCCs. Typical amperometry traces of AGCCs from male KO and wildtype (WT) mice are shown in Fig. 1A. Compared with WT counterparts, KO AGCCs from male mice presented a significantly reduced spike number per cell within the first 2 s of ACh stimulation (Fig. 1B) and within 60 s (Fig. 1C). The maximal spike height (Imax, Fig. 1D) and charge per peak (Q, Fig. 1E) of the KO AGCCs were also reduced, although the spike width at half-height (T½, Fig. 1F) and the time to reach the peak (Tpeak, Fig. 1G) were not significantly different from their WT counterparts. Analysis of the pre-spike feet (PSF) showed that the number of PSF per cell (Fig. 1H), the PSF amplitude (Fig. 1I), and the percentage of spikes with PSF (Fig. 1K) were all significantly reduced in AGCCs from male KO mice, compared with their WT counterparts. However, the PSF charge (Fig. 1K) and duration (Fig. 1L) were comparable between KO and WT AGCCs from male mice. Of note, all these amperometry parameters, including the number of spikes per cell were not significantly different in AGCCs from female KO and WT mice (Fig. S1). We next examined the cortical F-actin morphology in AGCCs after nicotine stimulation using confocal microscopy. Typical micrographs of continuous and disassembled cortical F-actin in resting and activated WT AGCCs (40 s after nicotine stimulation) are shown in Fig. 2A. The percentages of cells with disassembled F-actin ring in the resting KO and WT AGCCs cells are similar (Fig. 2B). When examined between 20 and 60 s after nicotine stimulation, KO AGCCs showed a consistently lower percentage of cells with disassembled cortical F-actin (Fig. 2B). However, after castration, the KO AGCCs reverted to the WT morphology as the percentage of cells with disassembled F-actin increased to a level similar to that of WT AGCCs (Fig. 2B). Castration did not affect the F-actin disassembly in WT AGCCs (Fig. 2C). F-actin disassembly in AGCCs from female KO and WT mice was also similar (Fig. 2D). Altogether these results suggest that EPHB6 deletion and testosterone are both indispensable for the compromised F-actin disassembly in AGCCs from male KO mice. We further elucidated how sex hormones in concert with EPHB6 regulated F-actin disassembly. When AGCCs from female KO mice were treated shortly for 15 min with cell-impermeable BSA-conjugated testosterone, their F-actin disassembly was compromised (Fig. 2E). BSA-conjugated testosterone had no effect on AGCCs from WT females (Fig. 2F), excluding the possibility that testosterone alone affected the F-actin disassembly. In contrast, when estrogen was added to the culture of AGCCs from male WT (Fig. 2G) or KO (Fig. 2H) mice, it manifested no significant effect on the F-actin disassembly. To prove that the reduced F-actin disassembly in KO cells due to cell-impermeable testosterone did have a functional consequence in terms of CAT secretion, we treated female AGCCs with BSA-conjugated testosterone. Such treatment indeed significantly reduced noradrenaline secretion by KO but not WT AGCCs (Fig. 2I). Altogether, these data indicate that the observed compromised F-actin disassembly in AGCCs from male KO mice is due to EPHB6 deletion in concert with the nongenomic effect of testosterone, whereas the absence of estrogen does not play a role in this matter. Furthermore, such F-actin disassembly appears functionally associated with CAT secretion. EPHB6 and its ligands (EFNBs) are capable of bidirectional signaling. To discern these two types of signaling related to CAT exocytosis of AGCCs, we employed solid-phase EPHB6 (EPHB6-FC–coated wells) and solid-phase anti-EPHB6 Ab (anti-EPHB6 Ab-coated wells) to stimulate tsAM5NE cells, which are derived from normal AGCCs (25Kohno S. Murata T. Koide N. Hikita K. Kaneda N. Establishment and characterization of a noradrenergic adrenal chromaffin cell line, tsAM5NE, immortalized with the temperature-sensitive SV40 T-antigen.Cell Biol. Int. 2011; 35 (21029049): 325-33410.1042/CBI20090344Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar). In the adrenal gland medullae, there are two types of chromaffin cells containing either epinephrine (EPI) or norepinephrine (NE) (26Tomlinson A. Durbin J. Coupland R.E. A quantitative analysis of rat adrenal chromaffin tissue: morphometric analysis at tissue and cellular level correlated with catecholamine content.Neuroscience. 1987; 20 (3601067): 895-90410.1016/0306-4522(87)90250-8Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). They secret EPI or NE, respectively (27Vollmer R.R. Baruchin A. Kolibal-Pegher S.S. Corey S.P. Stricker E.M. Kaplan B.B. Selective activation of norepinephrine- and epinephrine-secreting chromaffin cells in rat adrenal medulla.Am. J. Physiol. 1992; 263 (1415662): R716-R721PubMed Google Scholar). tsAM5NE cells are NE-secreting AGCCs (25Kohno S. Murata T. Koide N. Hikita K. Kaneda N. Establishment and characterization of a noradrenergic adrenal chromaffin cell line, tsAM5NE, immortalized with the temperature-sensitive SV40 T-antigen.Cell Biol. Int. 2011; 35 (21029049): 325-33410.1042/CBI20090344Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar); their NE secretion was used as a readout. As shown in Fig. 3A, solid-phase EPHB6 significantly augmented ACh-triggered NE release by AGCCs, whereas solid-phase anti-EPHB6 Ab had no such effect. Their respective proteins control normal human IgG (the Fc part of EPHB6-Fc was of human IgG origin) or normal mouse IgG did not impact on the NE release. This result indicated that the reverse signaling from EPHB6 to EFNBs was responsible for regulating NE exocytosis in AGCCs. To identify which EFNB was mediating such reverse signaling, we placed Ab against two major EPHB6 ligands, i.e. EFNB1 and EFNB2, on the solid-phase, and used them to stimulate tsAM5NE cells. Anti-EFNB1 but not anti-EFNB2 Ab drastically augmented ACh-stimulated NE secretion (Fig. 3B), suggesting that the major reverse signaling was mediated by EFNB1. EFNBs have no enzymatic activity, and their reverse signaling depends on the association of other signaling molecules with their short intracellular sequences. In the intracellular sequence of EFNB1, there are 5 tyrosine residues and a PDZ-binding domain at its C terminus (Fig. 3C). We constructed lentiviruses expressing full-length EFNB1 and various deletion mutants of the EFNB1 intracellular sequence (Fig. 3C). tsAM5NE cells were infected with these viruses. By adjusting virus concentrations, the tsAM5NE cell-surface overexpression of different EFNB1 mutants was titrated to a similar level according to flow cytometry (Fig. S2). The method of flow cytometry was described in the supplementary methods in supplementary Information. tsAM5NE cells overexpressing the full-length EFNB1 increased NE secretion significantly, compared with the empty virus-infected cells (both of them were cultured in anti-EFNB1 Ab-coated wells) (Fig. 3D). The cells with full-length EFNB1 overexpression and cultured in anti-EFNB1 AB-coated wells also had significantly increased NE secretion compared with the same kinds of cells cultured in wells coated with control IgG (i.e. without reverse signaling via EFNB1) (Fig. 3D). These controls validated the assay system as one being able to detect reverse signaling by overexpressed EFNB1 over the endogenous EFNB1 on the tsMA5NE cell surface. EFNB1-Δ2Y (the deletion of the last 16 aa of the C terminus including the PDZ-binding domain and two tyrosine residues, Tyr-342 and Tyr-343) was equally potent as the full-length EFNB1. The further deletion of 7 aa, including tyrosine residues Tyr-323 and Tyr-328 (EFNB1-Δ4Y), significantly reduced the potency of the mutant to stimulate NE secretion. The additional deletion of 11 aa containing the remaining tyrosine residues Tyr-312 and Tyr-316 (EFNB1-Δ6Y) did not result in a further decrease of the potency. These results suggested that the critical sequence mediating EFNB1 reverse signaling in mouse AGCCs in terms of controlling CAT secretion resided within the 7-aa intracellular sequence from aa 322 to 328, containing Tyr-323 and Tyr-328. It has been established that EFNB1 reverse signaling depends on several RHO family G-proteins (13Wu Z. Luo H. Thorin E. Tremblay J. Peng J. Lavoie J.L. Wang Y. Qi S. Wu T. Wu J.

We found that RHOA activity after nicotine stimulation in AGCCs from male KO was increased compared with their WT counterparts (Fig. 3E). This is compatible with prior knowledge that heightened RHOA activity increases actin polymerization (31Bader M.F. Doussau F. Chasserot-Golaz S. Vitale N. Gasman S. Coupling actin and membrane dynamics during calcium-regulated exocytosis: a role for Rho and ARF GTPases.Biochim. Biophys.

When AGCCs from male WT mice were treated with RHOA inhibitor Rhosin, no effect on F-actin disassembly was observed (Fig. 3F). However, such inhibition reverted the decreased F-actin disassembly in the KO cells to a level similar to that of the WT counterparts (Fig. 3F). This result indicated that the increased RHOA activity in the KO AGCCs contributed to the diminished F-actin disassembly. FYN was previously reported to interact with EFNB1 (32Palmer A. Zimmer M. Erdmann K.S. Eulenburg V. Porthin A. Heumann R. Deutsch U. Klein R. EphrinB phosphorylation and reverse signaling: regulation by Src kinases and PTP-BL phosphatase.Mol.

The SRC-family tyrosine kinase FYN was activated (based on its Tyr-420 phosphorylation) within 5–10 min of nicotine stimulation in AGCCs of WT male mice (Fig. 4A). Such phosphorylation was compromised in the KO AGCCs, whereas the total FYN protein remained unchanged (Fig. 4A). The tyrosine kinase c-ABL is a substrate of FYN kinase (33Plattner R. Kadlec L. DeMali K.A. Kazlauskas A. Pendergast A.M. c-Abl is activated by growth factors and Src family kinases and has a role in the cellular response to PDGF.Genes Dev. 1999; 13 (10500097): 2400-241110.1101/gad.13.18.2400Crossref PubMed Scopus (357) Google Scholar). Its phosphorylation, which is needed for its activation (33Plattner R. Kadlec L. DeMali K.A. Kazlauskas A. Pendergast A.M. c-Abl is activated by growth factors and Src family kinases and has a role in the cellular response to PDGF.Genes Dev. 1999; 13 (10500097): 2400-241110.1101/gad.13.18.2400Crossref PubMed Scopus (357) Google Scholar), was diminished, as expected, in AGCCs from male KO mice (Fig. 4B). In this experiment, total phosphoprotein was immunoprecipitated, followed by anti-c-ABL Ab blotting. We previously demonstrated that the phosphorylation of ELK1 was not influenced by EPHB6 KO in AGCCs (24Shi W. Wang Y. Peng J. Qi S. Vitale N. Kaneda N. Murata T. Luo H. Wu J. EPHB6 controls catecholamine biosynthesis by up-regulating tyrosine hydroxylase transcription in adrenal gland chromaffin cells.J. Biol.

Fig. 4B showed that ELK1 phosphorylation was similar in all the precipitated samples and was used as a loading and immunoprecipitation efficiency control. Furthermore, the total protein of c-ABL in the KO and WT AGCCs was similar (Fig. 4C). MICAL-1 is a substrate of the c-ABL kinase (34Yoon J. Kim S.B. Ahmed G. Shay J.W. Terman J.R. Amplification of F-actin disassembly and cellular repulsion by growth factor signaling.Dev. Cell. 2017; 42 (3926323): 117-129.e118Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar) and is an F-actin-monooxygenase, which oxidizes methionine residues of actin (35Hung R.J. Pak C.W. Terman J.R. Direct redox regulation of F-actin assembly and disassembly by Mical.Science. 2011; 334 (22116028): 1710-171310.1126/science.1211956Crossref PubMed Scopus (194) Google Scholar). It is essential in promoting the depolymerization of F-actin (35Hung R.J. Pak C.W. Terman J.R. Direct redox regulation of F-actin assembly and disassembly by Mical.Science. 2011; 334 (22116028): 1710-171310.1126/science.1211956Crossref PubMed Scopus (194) Google Scholar), and its phosphorylation is necessary for its activity (34Yoon J. Kim S.B. Ahmed G. Shay J.W. Terman J.R. Amplification of F-actin disassembly and cellular repulsion by growth factor signaling.Dev. Cell. 2017; 42 (3926323): 117-129.e118Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). Although total MICAL-1 protein levels in WT and KO AGCCs were similar in resting and 10-min nicotine-stimulated cells (Fig. 5A), MICAL-1 phosphorylation was significantly increased in stimulated male WT AGCCs (Fig. 5B). This augmentation was compromised in the KO AGCCs (Fig. 5B). FYN inhibitor PP2 suppressed the up-regulation of nicotine-stimulated MICAL-1 phosphorylation in the male WT AGCCs but did not affect the KO counterparts (Fig. 5B), supporting a model in which FYN acted downstream of EPHB6, and this activity appeared upstream of MICAL-1 phosphorylation. When the male WT AGCCs were treated with Imatinib, a c-ABL inhibitor, their MICAL-1 phosphorylation up-regulation upon nicotine stimulation was compromised (Fig. 5C). On the other hand, imatinib had no such effect on KO counterparts, suggesting that c-ABL activity was downstream of EPHB6 and upstream of MICAL-1 phosphorylation in these cells. ELK1 phosphorylation was again employed as an internal control for the efficiency of immunoprecipitation and loading in this experiment. To assess the functional consequences of FYN and c-ABL inhibition concerning F-actin disassembly, we treated the WT and KO AGCCs with FYN inhibitor PP2 (Fig. 6A) and c-ABL inhibitor imatinib (Fig. 6B). They effectively reduced F-actin disassembly in WT but not KO AGCCs. This finding suggested that reduced FYN and c-ABL activities occurred downstream of EPHB6, and were relevant to the reduced F-actin disassembly seen in the make KO AGCCs. In this work, we demonstrated that EPHB6 reverse signaling via a 7-aa intracellular sequence of EFNB1 between aa 322 and 328 was critical for regulating CAT exocytosis in AGCCs. The signaling from EFNB1 traversing through RHOA as well as through the FYN/c-ABL/MICAL-1/F-actin pathways was necessary for EPHB6's effect on CAT secretion. In our amperometric experiments, CAT vesicles released within 2 and 60 s after ACh stimulation were recorded. A reduced number of spikes during the first 2 s in KO AGCCs were found (Fig. 1C). Such reduction reflects reduced immediately-released CAT. This could be caused by the Ca2+ influx decrease in these cells, as we reported previously (19Wang Y. Shi W. Blanchette A. Peng J. Qi S. Luo H. Ledoux J. Wu J. EPHB6 and testosterone in concert regulate epinephrine release by adrenal gland chromaffin cells.Sci. Rep. 2018; 8 (29339804): 84210.1038/s41598-018-19215-2Crossref PubMed Scopus (7) Google Scholar), or caused by a smaller pool of immediately-releasable vesicles (IRVs), or both, in the KO AGCCs. Additional experiments will be needed to assess the pool size of IRVs. Analysis of individual spike parameters is commonly used to quantify the dynamics and size of single vesicular fusion events. We found here that the spike charge Q, reflecting the amount of CAT released per vesicle, was lower in male"

The present study demonstrates differences between right and left talar morphometric geometric profiles as fluctuating asymmetry in matched pairs of cadaveric specimens. Methods In total, 24 tali were collected in this study. All eligible tali were systematically measured with a Vernier caliper and three-dimensional laser scanner, which provided data for further analysis regarding the talar morphometric geometric profiles. Data were calculated to demonstrate differences between the right and left talar profiles using a matched-pair method, including the general size of the talus. Results The average talar length was 53.5 mm, the average talar dome height was 31.2 mm, and the average talar body width was 41.3 mm. The average anterior trochlear width, middle trochlear width, posterior trochlear width, and trochlear length were 31.8, 31.2, 28.3, and 30.7 mm, respectively. Eleven matched pairs of intact tali were eligible for the matched-pair study. Paired t-tests showed significant differences in the talar dome height (P = 0.019), middle trochlear width (P = 0.027), and posterior trochlear width (P = 0.016) between the right and left tali. However, there were no significant differences in the surface area or volume between the right and left tali. Conclusion Significant differences in the morphometric profile were found between the right and left matched pairs of tali. This basic information indicates that the profile of the contralateral talus may not be used as a single reference to reconstruct or duplicate the talus of interest in certain conditions such as talar prosthesis implantation or customized total ankle replacement."

Based on these Hermite functions, new improved first class of Side-Side (FCSS), second class of Side-Side (SCSS), first class of Side-Vertex (FCSV) and second class of Side-Vertex (SCSV) interpolation operators are proposed respectively, which can be used to construct C1 Coons surfaces over triangular domain. By altering the values of two shape parameters, the shape of the Coons surface patch can be adjusted flexibly, but without affecting the function values and partial derivatives of the boundaries. For constructing the triangular surface patches with the center of mass passing through a fixed point, we also give a center of mass function value control method, by which we can solve the corresponding shape parameter values. Moreover, we also apply these four improved interpolation operators to image interpolation. Compared with some widely used image interpolation methods, our methods achieve competitive performance."

Using sex-specific logistic spline-models, cross-sectional and longitudinal associations between obesity measures and seropositivity of the previously mentioned infections were investigated. Overall and abdominal fat content were significantly associated with seropositivity of varicella-zoster virus in both cross-sectional and longitudinal analyses among women. In addition, a non-significant inverse relationship with Epstein-Barr virus seroprevalence in both sexes and a trend towards a positive association with human herpesvirus 6 seropositivity in women were observed. Therefore, in women total body fat may be associated with VZV-seropositivity and may influence the reactivation of the varicella-zoster virus, independent of adipose tissue distribution."
https://openalex.org/W3017128381,"Widespread and ever-increasing anthropogenic impacts in the marine environment are driving a need to develop more efficient survey methods for monitoring changes in marine biodiversity. There is a particular urgent need for survey methods that could more rapidly and effectively detect change in species richness, abundance and community composition. Here, test the suitability of the Mackinnon Lists Technique for use in the marine environment by testing its effectiveness for rapid assessment of fish communities. The MacKinnon Lists Technique is a time-efficient and cost-effective sampling method developed for studying avian tropical biodiversity, in which several list samples of species can be collected from a single survey. Using the well-established MaxN approach on data from deployments of a Baited Remote Underwater Video Systems for comparison, we tested the suitability of the MacKinnon Lists Technique for use in marine environments by analysing tropical reef fish communities. Using both methods for each data set, differences in community composition between depths and levels of protection were assessed. Both methods were comparable for diversity and evenness indices with similar ranks for species. Multivariate analysis showed that the MacKinnon Lists Technique and MaxN detected similar differences in community composition at different depths and protection status. However, the MacKinnon Lists Technique detected significant differences between factors when fewer videos (representing reduced survey effort) were used. We conclude that the MacKinnon Lists Technique is at least as effective as the widely used MaxN method for detecting differences between communities in the marine environment and suggest can do so with lower survey effort. The MacKinnon Lists Technique has the potential to be widely used as an effective new tool for rapid conservation monitoring in marine ecosystems."
