https://openalex.org/W1993378267,"We have converted nanoscale mechanical energy into electrical energy by means of piezoelectric zinc oxide nanowire (NW) arrays. The aligned NWs are deflected with a conductive atomic force microscope tip in contact mode. The coupling of piezoelectric and semiconducting properties in zinc oxide creates a strain field and charge separation across the NW as a result of its bending. The rectifying characteristic of the Schottky barrier formed between the metal tip and the NW leads to electrical current generation. The efficiency of the NW-based piezoelectric power generator is estimated to be 17 to 30%. This approach has the potential of converting mechanical, vibrational, and/or hydraulic energy into electricity for powering nanodevices."

The material can be patterned using standard nanolithography methods. The transport properties, which are closely related to those of carbon nanotubes, are dominated by the single epitaxial graphene layer at the silicon carbide interface and reveal the Dirac nature of the charge carriers. Patterned structures show quantum confinement of electrons and phase coherence lengths beyond 1 micrometer at 4 kelvin, with mobilities exceeding 2.5 square meters per volt-second. All-graphene electronically coherent devices and device architectures are envisaged."

However, product binding has inhibited catalytic turnover in such systems, and selectivity has rarely approached the levels observed in more structurally elaborate natural enzymes. We found that an aqueous organopalladium cage induces highly unusual regioselectivity in the Diels-Alder coupling of anthracene and phthalimide guests, promoting reaction at a terminal rather than central anthracene ring. Moreover, a similar bowl-shaped host attains efficient catalytic turnover in coupling the same substrates (although with the conventional regiochemistry), most likely because the product geometry inhibits the aromatic stacking interactions that attract the planar reagents to the host."

We test the receptors with a panel of over 100 odors and find that strong responses are sparse, with response density dependent on chemical class. Individual receptors range along a continuum from narrowly tuned to broadly tuned. Broadly tuned receptors are most sensitive to structurally similar odorants. Strikingly, inhibitory responses are widespread among receptors. The temporal dynamics of the receptor repertoire provide a rich representation of odor quality, quantity, and duration. Receptors with similar odor sensitivity often map to widely dispersed glomeruli in the antennal lobe. We construct a multidimensional “odor space” based on the responses of each individual receptor and find that the positions of odors depend on their chemical class, concentration, and molecular complexity. The space provides a basis for predicting behavioral responses to odors."

Barriers to the introduction of hydrogen as the fuel have stimulated interest in developing an anode material that can be used with natural gas under operating temperatures 650°C &lt; T &lt; 1000°C. Here we report identification of the double perovskites Sr 2 Mg 1- x Mn x MoO 6-δ that meet the requirements for long-term stability with tolerance to sulfur and show a superior single-cell performance in hydrogen and methane."

Results are presented for the dissociative ionization of deuterium molecules (D 2 ⇒ D + + D), where asymmetric ejection of the ionic fragment reveals that light-driven intramolecular electronic motion before dissociation localizes the electron on one of the two D + ions in a controlled way. The results extend subfemtosecond electron control to molecules and provide evidence of its usefulness in controlling reaction dynamics."
https://openalex.org/W2102548112,"The molecular organization of presynaptic active zones during calcium influx–triggered neurotransmitter release is the focus of intense investigation. The Drosophila coiled-coil domain protein Bruchpilot (BRP) was observed in donut-shaped structures centered at active zones of neuromuscular synapses by using subdiffraction resolution STED (stimulated emission depletion) fluorescence microscopy. At brp mutant active zones, electron-dense projections (T-bars) were entirely lost, Ca 2+ channels were reduced in density, evoked vesicle release was depressed, and short-term plasticity was altered. BRP-like proteins seem to establish proximity between Ca 2+ channels and vesicles to allow efficient transmitter release and patterned synaptic plasticity."
https://openalex.org/W2149512324,"Obesity is a heritable trait and a risk factor for many common diseases such as type 2 diabetes, heart disease, and hypertension. We used a dense whole-genome scan of DNA samples from the Framingham Heart Study participants to identify a common genetic variant near the INSIG2 gene associated with obesity. We have replicated the finding in four separate samples composed of individuals of Western European ancestry, African Americans, and children. The obesity-predisposing genotype is present in 10% of individuals. Our study suggests that common genetic polymorphisms are important determinants of obesity."
https://openalex.org/W2009464531,"We observe that a nanostructured metal can be hardened by annealing and softened when subsequently deformed, which is in contrast to the typical behavior of a metal. Microstructural investigation points to an effect of the structural scale on fundamental mechanisms of dislocation-dislocation and dislocation-interface reactions, such that heat treatment reduces the generation and interaction of dislocations, leading to an increase in strength and a reduction in ductility. A subsequent deformation step may restore the dislocation structure and facilitate the yielding process when the metal is stressed. As a consequence, the strength decreases and the ductility increases. These observations suggest that for materials such as the nanostructured aluminum studied here, deformation should be used as an optimizing procedure instead of annealing."
https://openalex.org/W2067834397,"Liver mass depends on one or more unidentified humoral signals that drive regeneration when liver functional capacity is diminished. Bile acids are important liver products, and their levels are tightly regulated. Here, we identify a role for nuclear receptor–dependent bile acid signaling in normal liver regeneration. Elevated bile acid levels accelerate regeneration, and decreased levels inhibit liver regrowth, as does the absence of the primary nuclear bile acid receptor FXR. We propose that FXR activation by increased bile acid flux is a signal of decreased functional capacity of the liver. FXR, and possibly other nuclear receptors, may promote homeostasis not only by regulating expression of appropriate metabolic target genes but also by driving homeotrophic liver growth."

Using protein correlation profiling, we have mapped 1,404 proteins to ten subcellular locations in mouse liver, and these correspond with enzymatic assays, marker protein profiles, and confocal microscopy. These localizations allowed assessment of the specificity in published organellar proteomic inventories and demonstrate multiple locations for 39% of all organellar proteins. Integration of proteomic and genomic data enabled us to identify networks of coexpressed genes, cis-regulatory motifs, and putative transcriptional regulators involved in organelle biogenesis.

Integration of proteomic and genomic data enabled us to identify networks of coexpressed genes, cis-regulatory motifs, and putative transcriptional regulators involved in organelle biogenesis. Our analysis ties biochemistry, cell biology, and genomics into a common framework for organelle analysis. For over a century, the eukaryotic cell has been analyzed biochemically and imaged in countless ways to arrive at our modern model of a protective plasma membrane surrounding several membrane-enclosed organelles. Many specialized functions are compartmentalized within these organelles, such as protein and lipid biosynthesis in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) and Golgi apparatus or oxidative phosphorylation in the mitochondria. Cell biologists have taken a holistic approach to study organelles, using dyes and optical methods to define distinct morphological patterns. Conversely, biochemists have disrupted cells to separate compartments and complexes, usually by density gradient centrifugation, in order to characterize the chemical, physical, or enzymatic properties of each (Figure 1). To aid the interpretation of both biochemical and microscopic examination of an organelle, certain proteins or enzyme activities that appear to localize exclusively to that organelle are considered markers, essentially defining that compartment. Recently, proteomics (de Hoog and Mann, 2004de Hoog C.L. Mann M. Proteomics.Annu. Rev. Genomics Hum. Genet. 2004; 5: 267-293Crossref PubMed Scopus (195) Google Scholar) has been applied to study organelle composition. The genetic tractability of Saccharomyces cerevisiae has allowed a large fraction of yeast ORFs to be tagged for localization studies (Ross-Macdonald et al., 1999Ross-Macdonald P. Coelho P.S. Roemer T. Agarwal S. Kumar A. Jansen R. Cheung K.H. Sheehan A. Symoniatis D.

Howson R.W. Weissman J.S. O'Shea E.K. Global analysis of protein localization in budding yeast.Nature. 2003; 425: 686-691Crossref PubMed Scopus (3291) Google Scholar), but such an approach is more challenging in mammalian systems due, in part, to artifacts from overexpression (Simpson et al., 2000Simpson J.C. Wellenreuther R. Poustka A. Pepperkok R. Wiemann S. Systematic subcellular localization of novel proteins identified by large-scale cDNA sequencing.EMBO Rep. 2000; 1: 287-292Crossref PubMed Scopus (298) Google Scholar). Mass spectrometry-based proteomics (Aebersold and Mann, 2003Aebersold R. Mann M. Mass spectrometry-based proteomics.Nature. 2003; 422: 198-207Crossref PubMed Scopus (5581) Google Scholar) is often employed to characterize the protein composition of organelle-enriched fractions. Indeed, protein catalogs are now available for virtually all cytoplasmic organelles as well as most of the major nuclear ones (reviewed in Yates et al., 2005Yates 3rd, J.R. Gilchrist A. Howell K.E. Bergeron J.J.M. Proteomics of organelles and large cellular structures.Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2005; 6: 702-714Crossref PubMed Scopus (344) Google Scholar). However, due to the high sensitivity of mass spectrometers and the difficulties inherent in purifying organelles to homogeneity, it has been challenging to distinguish bona fide organellar proteins from those that are contaminating. To address this problem, we previously introduced protein correlation profiling (PCP) (Andersen et al., 2003Andersen J.S. Wilkinson C.J. Mayor T. Mortensen P. Nigg E.A. Mann M. Proteomic characterization of the human centrosome by protein correlation profiling.Nature. 2003; 426: 570-574Crossref PubMed Scopus (1051) Google Scholar) to study the human centrosome. In that study, mass spectrometric intensity profiles from centrosomal marker proteins were used to define a consensus profile through a density centrifugation gradient, in direct analogy to Western blotting profiling of gradient fractions. Distribution curves generated from the intensities of tens of thousands of peptides from consecutive fractions established centrosomal proteins by their similarity to the consensus profile using mean squared deviation (χ2 value). In the present study, we extend PCP to the entire cell (Figure 1A) to localize 1,400 proteins to ten cellular compartments (Figure 1B), and we confirm these data with biochemical and cell biological methods. Furthermore, we integrate the results with functional genomics datasets to gain insights into the biogenesis of cellular organelles. Mouse liver homogenates were resolved by rate-zonal centrifugation (Figure 2A), and fractions were digested to peptides prior to analysis by liquid chromatography/tandem mass spectrometry (LC/MS/MS) using a linear ion-trap/Fourier transform hybrid mass spectrometer (Syka et al., 2004Syka J.E. Marto J.A. Bai D.L. Horning S. Senko M.W. Schwartz J.C. Ueberheide B. Garcia B. Busby S. Muratore T. et al.Novel linear quadrupole ion trap/FT mass spectrometer: performance characterization and use in the comparative analysis of histone H3 post-translational modifications.J. Proteome Res. 2004; 3: 621-626Crossref PubMed Scopus (333) Google Scholar). Database searches with the fragmentation spectra identified 2,197 unique proteins (Table S1) from 22,256 distinct peptides (Table S2) that, by requiring two sequenced peptides per protein and less than 15 parts per million (p.p.m.) mass accuracy, contain a false positive rate of about one protein in 8,000 (Experimental Procedures). Common peptides identified in neighboring fractions were used to correlate elution times between each fraction (Andersen et al., 2003Andersen J.S. Wilkinson C.J. Mayor T. Mortensen P. Nigg E.A. Mann M. Proteomic characterization of the human centrosome by protein correlation profiling.Nature. 2003; 426: 570-574Crossref PubMed Scopus (1051) Google Scholar) so that ion current profiles across the gradient could be generated for the peptides and compiled into protein correlation profiles (Experimental Procedures). Due to the very large amount of analysis time involved, most data discussed here were generated from a single mouse liver, but a localization error rate of 6% was estimated from repeated PCP analysis of mitochondria (see Experimental Procedures and Table S8). Of the identified proteins, the quantitative data for 1900 were reliable enough to evaluate their subcellular locations (Figure 1B). To determine the PCP of well-studied organelles, we examined the profiles of several well-characterized marker proteins, including 130 kDa Golgi phosphoprotein (GPP130, Golgi), AP-2 assembly subunit AP17 (plasma membrane [PM]), early endosome antigen 1 (EEA1, early endosomes [EE]), transferrin receptor 2 (TfR2, recycling endosome [RE]), calnexin (ER), p115 (ER/Golgi-derived vesicles [ERGDV]), and F1-F0 ATP synthase β subunit (mitochondria). Each of these markers peaked in different gradient fractions and had distinct profiles; thus at least these seven organelles could be distinguished with confidence (Figure 2B). Markers of other compartments were also observed, but their profiles matched closely to one of the seven mentioned above. In particular, ERGIC-53, a marker for the ER-Golgi intermediate compartment, overlapped very closely with the ER, as has been reported previously (Breuza et al., 2004Breuza L. Halbeisen R. Jeno P. Otte S. Barlowe C. Hong W. Hauri H.P. Proteomics of ERGIC membranes from brefeldin A-treated HepG2 cells identifies ERGIC-32, a new cycling protein that interacts with human Erv46.J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 242-253Crossref Scopus (90) Google Scholar). Likewise, the profiles of cation-independent mannose 6-phosphate receptor and adaptor-related protein 1β, markers of the late endosome and trans-Golgi network, respectively, largely overlapped with TfR2 (Tables S3 and S4). This suggests that these compartments migrate similarly in rate-zonal centrifugation and is in agreement with the specialized conditions required for even partial segregation reported by others (Tulp et al., 1998Tulp A. Fernandez-Borja M. Verwoerd D. Neefjes J. High-resolution density gradient electrophoresis of subcellular organelles and proteins under nondenaturing conditions.Electrophoresis. 1998; 19: 1288-1293Crossref PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar, Hashiramoto and James, 2000Hashiramoto M. James D.E. Characterization of insulin-responsive GLUT4 storage vesicles isolated from 3T3–L1 adipocytes.Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 416-427Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). Interestingly, the profile for several proteasome subunits showed these proteins were enriched near 0.62 M sucrose, suggesting that the proteasome complex also migrated during centrifugation but not as quickly as any membrane bound organelle observed (Figure 2B). The profiles of proteasome subunits β1, α6, and α7 were thus used as a standard curve for PCP comparisons. Ribosomes, much larger multimolecular complexes than proteasomes, migrated further in our gradients, apparently as both free complexes and attached to the ER. However, the PCP of free ribosomes overlapped those of several organelles. Finally, since the initial homogenate was layered on top of the gradient and only large complexes or organelles migrate during centrifugation, cytosolic proteins remain highly enriched in the low-density fractions—typified by the glycolytic enzyme fructose bisphosphate aldolase C (Figure 2B). Measurement of the activities for amine oxidase (mitochondrial marker), γ-glutamyltransferase (PM marker), and nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate (NADP)-phosphatase (Golgi marker) provided further confirmation of the separation of these organelles (Figure 2C). Having established organellar profiles, we then evaluated the distribution of all 1,900 proteins using a more stringent cutoff criterion for the χ2 test than we have used previously. Using the rules described more fully in Experimental Procedures, the PCPs of 1,258 proteins matched to at least one of the markers mentioned above and were distributed as follows: mitochondria—297, ER—229, Golgi—67, ERGDV—220, EE—76, RE—326, PM—250, proteasome—50, cytosol—488 (Figure 1B; for all 1,404 cytoplasmic and nuclear localizations, see Table S5). Where we sequenced peptides that allowed us to distinguish one isoform from another, we were in some cases able to discern differential localization. For instance, Rab1a was found in ERGDV, while Rab2b was found in the EE and RE/TGN (Table S5). This dataset is available in the supplementary tables and also as a database at proteome.biochem.mpg.de/ormd.htm. It represents a major advance in large-scale protein localization, especially in mammals, and is likely to complement data obtained via other methods for several reasons: (1) the information is derived from native liver tissue, avoiding artifacts of cell culture; (2) the locations are derived for endogenous proteins rather than overexpression of exogenous, tagged proteins, avoiding pitfalls associated with fluorescence-based assays in mammalian systems (Wiemann et al., 2004Wiemann S. Arlt D. Huber W. Wellenreuther R. Schleeger S. Mehrle A. Bechtel S. Sauermann M. Korf U. Pepperkok R. et al.From ORFeome to biology: a functional genomics pipeline.Genome Res. 2004; 14: 2136-2144Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar); and (3) by only selecting proteins matching consensus profiles, background proteins are eliminated. Notably, this study achieved similar or deeper coverage of genuine organellar components than previous proteomics studies dedicated to specific compartments (see below). However, the PCP localizations presented here certainly do not yet cover the entire protein composition of any organelle, and further, more in-depth study of each will be required. While these data represent an unbiased set of localizations, we evaluated these assignments based on known information about each protein in order to estimate our own potential false positive rate (see Supplemental Experimental Procedures). Using the functional and spatial annotations in the UniProt and Gene Ontology databases, we asked whether the localizations we found matched previously reported data, excluding that collected in proteomic studies. Remarkably, in those cases where annotations contained unambiguous localization information, the PCP-based organelle assignments reported here were correct in 87% of all cases. In a separate experiment, we quantified the relative abundances of 734 proteins in nuclear versus cytoplasmic preparations (Tables S3 and S4) based on integrated peptide ion intensities in LC/MS analyses of each. Major nuclear proteins, including histones, lamin, and fibrillarin, were enriched several hundred-fold in the nucleus, while the opposite was true for proteins such as glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH) and translation initiation factors. The nuclear proteins observed in the gradient of cytoplasmic material likely represent newly synthesized products, given that they largely associated with biosynthetic organelles and that this level represents far less than 1% of the total within the cell. Thus this quantitative proteomic dataset can be mined for nuclear/cytoplasmic distributions of many protein families. For example, in the liver tissue we examined, proteasome subunits were, on average, 12 times more abundant in cytoplasm than in the nuclear fraction, with some regulatory subunits exclusive to the cytoplasm. This is in contrast to previous microscopic studies suggesting a more even distribution (Peters et al., 1994Peters J.M. Franke W.W. Kleinschmidt J.A. Distinct 19 S and 20 S subcomplexes of the 26 S proteasome and their distribution in the nucleus and the cytoplasm.J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 7709-7718Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, Reits et al., 1997Reits E.A. Benham A.M. Plougastel B. Neefjes J. Trowsdale J. Dynamics of proteasome distribution in living cells.EMBO J. 1997; 16: 6087-6094Crossref PubMed Scopus (241) Google Scholar). At least 90% of protein mass in liver comes from hepatocytes, with smaller contributions from Kupffer cells and various endothelial and epithelial cells. Thus, the protein localizations described here are largely representative of hepatocytes. While it is formally possible for an organelle from Kupffer cells to sediment at a different rate than the corresponding organelle in hepatocytes, we could find no systematic evidence of this. The protein localizations reported here can now be used to assess outstanding issues in cell biology. For example, several groups have suggested that glycolytic enzymes associate with mitochondria, largely based on their presence in mitochondria-enriched fractions (Danial et al., 2003Danial N.N. Gramm C.F. Scorrano L. Zhang C.Y. Krauss S. Ranger A.M. Datta S.R. Greenberg M.E. Licklider L.J. Lowell B.B. et al.BAD and glucokinase reside in a mitochondrial complex that integrates glycolysis and apoptosis.Nature. 2003; 424: 952-956Crossref PubMed Scopus (592) Google Scholar, Gaucher et al., 2004Gaucher S.P. Taylor S.W. Fahy E. Zhang B. Warnock D.E. Ghosh S.S. Gibson B.W. Expanded coverage of the human heart mitochondrial proteome using multidimensional liquid chromatography coupled with tandem mass spectrometry.J. Proteome Res. 2004; 3: 495-505Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). The PCP evidence gathered here argues against this, especially for GAPDH (Figure 2D) and aldolase (Table S3), whose profiles clearly show that they do not physically associate with mitochondria, at least under the conditions used in our preparation. Thus, data tying these enzymes to mitochondria may instead reflect functional interactions. At least 373 of the 968 proteins localized to cytoplasmic organelles or the proteasome were found in more than one compartment (not including cytosol or nucleus) (Table S5). In many cases, these multiple localizations might be predicted a priori given a basic knowledge of cell biology. Many proteins were found in more than one of the ER, Golgi, and/or ERGDV, likely reflecting the dynamic retro and anterograde traffic between these locations. In cases where one organelle is derived from another, such as the PM and RE, multiple localizations were also common. Sorting nexins (Snx) 1, 2, and 9 were in both the PM and RE as well as on the ER (Snx2) and ERGDV (Snx1 and 2). However, the unexpectedly large fraction of localizations to multiple organelles would likely go undiscovered with other large-scale methods as such assignments using microscopy require the use of multiple labels for colocalization and thus are essentially impossible in large-scale studies when no markers are used (Huh et al., 2003Huh W.K. Falvo J.V. Gerke L.C. Carroll A.S. Howson R.W. Weissman J.S. O'Shea E.K.

Pepperkok R. et al.From ORFeome to biology: a functional genomics pipeline.Genome Res. 2004; 14: 2136-2144Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). For the subset of proteins whose subcellular locations have been well characterized in more focused studies of single proteins, our results agree 87% of the time, as discussed above, but in many cases PCP revealed multimodal distributions for proteins previously described as resident in single organelles. Protein abundance is now recognized to be a key parameter describing a proteome, and a first proteome-wide study has recently been reported in yeast (Ghaemmaghami et al., 2003Ghaemmaghami S. Huh W.K. Bower K. Howson R.W. Belle A. Dephoure N. O'Shea E.K. Weissman J.S. Global analysis of protein expression in yeast.Nature. 2003; 425: 737-741Crossref PubMed Scopus (2992) Google Scholar). We calculated a protein abundance index (PAI) that provides a rough measure of abundance for each protein measured in liver tissue. We used the extracted ion current PAI (xPAI) (Rappsilber et al., 2003Rappsilber, J., Ishihama, Y., Foster, L.J., Mittler, G., and Mann, M. (2003). Approximate relative abundance of proteins within a mixture determined from LC-MS data. In Abstracts of the 51st Conference in Mass Spectrometry and Allied Topics.Google Scholar), which represents the average ion current for the three most intense peptides from each protein. This resulted in a rough estimation of protein abundance, similar to protein staining methods, and demonstrates that we were able to detect proteins spanning a concentration range of about 105 between the most and least abundant proteins identified (Tables S3 and S4). These data should represent the vast majority of protein mass in the liver and may be useful in modeling major functions in this organ, such as detoxification or intermediary metabolism. While the classical tool of the organelle biochemist is gradient centrifugation, for the organelle cell biologist it is fluorescence microscopy. Through the use of standard marker proteins, we have already classified the PCPs of several organelles but, as mentioned above, several proteins appeared to localize to more than one compartment. Therefore, we utilized indirect immunofluorescence and confocal microscopy to visualize how overlapping or nonoverlapping PCPs translate into visual patterns. As an example of mostly overlapping PCPs, the profiles of TfR2 and secretory carrier-associated membrane protein-3 (SCAMP) indicated that both were highly enriched in the fractions enriched for the EE and RE compartments (Figure 3), consistent with their known functions. In accordance with this, the immunofluorescent patterns of these two proteins overlapped in an RE-like compartment as well as in large punctae reminiscent of early endosomes. However, their PCPs did not overlap completely, and this was reflected in the punctate green (SCAMP) pattern and plasmalemmal red (TfR2) staining seen in the merged image (Figure 3, first row). Neprilysin1, a protein localized to the ERGDV by PCP, showed less extensive overlap with clathrin HC, which PCP assigned mainly to the PM. However, the PCPs for both proteins had a shoulder extending into fraction 17, where TfR2 peaked, and this was reflected in their staining patterns (Azarani et al., 1998Azarani A. Boileau G. Crine P. Recombinant human endothelin-converting enzyme ECE-1b is located in an intracellular compartment when expressed in polarized Madin-Darby canine kidney cells.Biochem.

Association of the AP-3 adaptor complex with clathrin.Science. 1998; 280: 431-434Crossref PubMed Scopus (308) Google Scholar), which were largely distinct from one another but displayed partial overlap in a perinuclear region (Figure 3, second row) similar to that seen for TfR2. On the other hand, the PCP for neprilysin1 showed little or no overlap with the PCPs from any proteasome subunits or cytochrome c, and double labeling of mouse liver cells showed no overlapping staining for these proteins (Figure 3, third and fourth rows). As demonstrated in these examples, immunofluorescence links the localizations determined biochemically by PCP with classical cell biological methods and indicate that much information can be derived from careful examination of individual PCPs. Previous studies have utilized mass spectrometry-based proteomics to catalogue the components of organelles. In these studies, there are two possible sources for false-positive localizations: incorrect protein identifications or incorrect assignment of contaminating proteins. We have essentially eliminated the first source of error by using high-performance mass spectrometry, and we exclude contaminating proteins via PCP. Figure 2D demonstrates the difficulty in distinguishing copurifying proteins from organelle components in the absence of gradient profile information. To extend the mitochondria example, we identified 645 proteins in mitochondrial fractions, yet after PCP analysis only 297 of these had profiles matching the mitochondrial standard curve. The set of proteins validated by PCP, but not the remaining proteins, agreed very well with mitochondrial proteins described in the literature, excluding other proteomic studies. In order to estimate the level of agreement between our study and published organelle catalogues, we asked whether our PCP data agreed with previously reported (Da Cruz et al., 2003Da Cruz S.

Omission of CCCTC-binding factor (CTCF) or deletion of the maternal ICR abrogated this association and altered Wsb1/Nf1 gene expression.

Although both share common mechanisms of cell biology and biochemistry, little is known about their coordinated integration in the formation of neural circuits.

This tangential migration contributes to the establishment of a permissive corridor that is essential for thalamocortical axon pathfinding. Our results also demonstrate that in this process two different products of the Neuregulin-1 gene, CRD-NRG1 and Ig-NRG1, mediate the guidance of thalamocortical axons.

These results show that neuronal tangential migration constitutes a novel mechanism to control the timely arrangement of guidance cues required for axonal tract formation in the mammalian brain. The neural assembly underlying the formation of functional networks in the central nervous system (CNS) is probably the most complex biological system in vertebrates. Ultimately, brain function depends on the ability of specific populations of neurons to connect with a restricted number of appropriate synaptic partners among an astonishing number of undesired targets. This pattern of connections, which is highly reproducible among different individuals of the same species, is established during development through a series of consecutive events. This program begins with the process of neural induction and the differentiation of distinct classes of neurons from progenitor cells (Jessell, 2000Jessell T.M. Neuronal specification in the spinal cord: inductive signals and transcriptional codes.Nat. Rev. Genet. 2000; 1: 20-29Crossref PubMed Scopus (1555) Google Scholar). Once distinct neuronal populations have been generated, immature neurons migrate from progenitor regions to more superficial positions of the neural tube, where axonal connections eventually occur (Hatten, 2002Hatten M.E. New directions in neuronal migration.Science. 2002; 297: 1660-1663Crossref PubMed Scopus (271) Google Scholar). Neurons then extend axons, which navigate through the developing brain following highly stereotyped routes to find specific targets (Tessier-Lavigne and Goodman, 1996Tessier-Lavigne M. Goodman C.S. The molecular biology of axon guidance.Science. 1996; 274: 1123-1133Crossref PubMed Scopus (2592) Google Scholar). Finally, refinement of axonal terminals shapes the pattern of synaptic connections that will ultimately imprint the behaviors of the adult organism (Benson et al., 2000Benson D.L. Schnapp L.M. Shapiro L. Huntley G.W. Making memories stick: cell-adhesion molecules in synaptic plasticity.Trends Cell Biol. 2000; 10: 473-482Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (167) Google Scholar). Somewhat surprisingly, these different events are normally analyzed as independent processes, although it is evident that they must have been efficiently linked through evolution to ensure the precise formation of neural circuits. Axons are guided along specific pathways by guidance molecules positioned in the extracellular environment (Tessier-Lavigne and Goodman, 1996Tessier-Lavigne M. Goodman C.S. The molecular biology of axon guidance.Science. 1996; 274: 1123-1133Crossref PubMed Scopus (2592) Google Scholar, Dickson, 2002Dickson B.J. Molecular mechanisms of axon guidance.Science. 2002; 298: 1959-1964Crossref PubMed Scopus (1113) Google Scholar). They navigate following a series of distinct steps in which specific guidance cues located at defined decision points determine their direction. In axon pathfinding, therefore, not only guidance factors are important; the precise distribution of guidance molecules in time and space constitutes an essential part of the process. Much progress has been made during the past ten years in the identification of molecules controlling growth cone guidance (Tessier-Lavigne and Goodman, 1996Tessier-Lavigne M. Goodman C.S. The molecular biology of axon guidance.Science. 1996; 274: 1123-1133Crossref PubMed Scopus (2592) Google Scholar, Dickson, 2002Dickson B.J. Molecular mechanisms of axon guidance.Science. 2002; 298: 1959-1964Crossref PubMed Scopus (1113) Google Scholar). In contrast, our understanding of the mechanisms controlling the precise timing and arrangement of guidance cues is much more limited. Patterning mechanisms contribute to ensure that growth cones find their way in the brain by inducing the expression of appropriate sets of guidance molecules in specific groups of neuroepithelial cells. In addition to neuroepithelial cells, postmitotic neurons also contribute to display guidance information as the brain develops. Patterning information—and therefore the expression of guidance cues—is transferred from neural progenitors to postmitotic cells through the process of radial migration, in which neurons that are born nearby occupy adjacent locations in the mantle (Rakic, 1988Rakic P. Specification of cerebral cortical areas.Science. 1988; 241: 170-176Crossref PubMed Scopus (2197) Google Scholar). Thus, radial migration contributes to the arrangement of guidance cues for axon guidance by faithfully conveying patterning information from progenitors to postmitotic neurons. Tangential migration represents a second general mechanism of neuronal translocation in the developing CNS (Hatten, 2002Hatten M.E. New directions in neuronal migration.Science. 2002; 297: 1660-1663Crossref PubMed Scopus (271) Google Scholar). This mode of migration is a primitive trait of the vertebrate brain, and it is thought to have evolved as a mechanism to increase the complexity of neuronal circuits because it allows neurons born from distant progenitor zones to intermingle in a final common destination (Corbin et al., 2001Corbin J.G. Nery S. Fishell G. Telencephalic cells take a tangent: non-radial migration in the mammalian forebrain.Nat. Neurosci. 2001; 4: 1177-1182Crossref PubMed Scopus (240) Google Scholar, Marín and Rubenstein, 2001Marín O. Rubenstein J.L.R. A long, remarkable journey: tangential migration in the telencephalon.Nat. Rev. Neurosci. 2001; 2: 780-790Crossref PubMed Scopus (790) Google Scholar). The ability of tangential migration to supply distinct regions of the nervous system with immigrant neurons raises the intriguing question of whether this mode of migration may contribute to axonal pathfinding by providing with novel guidance cues for growing axons. Tangential migration occurs extensively throughout the nervous system but is more prominent in the ventral telencephalon, through which various major axonal tracts, such as the thalamocortical connection, traverse. Thalamocortical projections constitute one of the most prominent higher-level processing connections in the mammalian brain. Thalamocortical axons (TCAs) convey sensory and motor inputs to the cerebral cortex, where integration of this information leads to perception and the organization of appropriate responses. The functional complexity of the thalamocortical projection is the consequence of an extremely elaborate process of axon guidance, orderly linking the various thalamic nuclei with specific cortical regions. Here we provide evidence for a novel mechanism of axon guidance by demonstrating that the tangential migration of a specific neuronal population is essential for the normal guidance of thalamocortical projections. These neurons, which we have designated corridor cells, migrate tangentially within the ventral telencephalon to generate an intermediate target for TCAs, forming a permissive bridge through an otherwise nonpermissive territory for the growth of TCAs. Extension of TCAs through this permissive corridor also requires the existence of axon-growth-promoting factors generated in the developing cortex. The molecular basis for this novel guidance mechanism relies on different forms of the Neuregulin-1 (Nrg1) gene and their ErbB4 receptor, which coordinately represent the first signaling system identified to mediate the role of tangentially migrating corridor cells in the guidance of thalamocortical projections. TCAs follow a highly stereotyped pathway from their origin in the dorsal thalamus to their final target, the cerebral cortex (López-Bendito and Molnár, 2003López-Bendito G. Molnár Z. Thalamocortical development: how are we going to get there?.Nat. Rev. Neurosci. 2003; 4: 276-289Crossref PubMed Scopus (330) Google Scholar, Garel and Rubenstein, 2004Garel S. Rubenstein J.L. Intermediate targets in formation of topographic projections: inputs from the thalamocortical system.Trends Neurosci. 2004; 27: 533-539Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). They run rostrally toward the telencephalon, make a sharp turn dorsally to enter the mantle region of the medial ganglionic eminence (MGE), and then advance through the striatum to finally reach the developing cortex (Figures 1A and 1I). As they first enter the telencephalon around embryonic day (E) 13, TCAs navigate through a narrow corridor located superficial to the progenitor zones of the MGE and deep to the developing mantle, where the globus pallidus is starting to form (Figure 1A). The existence of this corridor through which TCAs specifically extend suggests it may be involved in their guidance. To test this possibility, we first examined the molecular identity of cells present in this domain. Cells located within the MGE corridor do not express detectable levels of genes characteristic of this region, such as Nkx2-1 or Lhx6 (Figures 1B and S1) (Sussel et al., 1999Sussel L. Marín O. Kimura S. Rubenstein J.L. Loss of Nkx2.1 homeobox gene function results in a ventral to dorsal molecular respecification within the basal telencephalon: evidence for a transformation of the pallidum into the striatum.Development. 1999; 126: 3359-3370PubMed Google Scholar). In contrast, we found that corridor cells specifically express markers of lateral ganglionic eminence (LGE) derivatives. In particular, corridor cells express Islet1, Ebf1, and Meis2 (Figures 1C–1F and S1), three transcription factors present in the neighboring striatum, the main LGE mantle derivative. Corridor cells also express the γ-aminobutyric acid (GABA) synthesis enzyme Gad67, suggesting they are GABA-containing (GABAergic) neurons (Figure S1). Double immunohistochemistry using Calretinin as a marker for TCAs demonstrated that incoming axons grow in close contact with Islet1-expressing corridor cells (Figures 1G and 1H). In sum, the MGE domain used by TCAs to first grow into the telencephalon is unexpectedly made of neurons expressing a combination of molecular markers common to LGE derivatives (Figure 1I). To understand how the corridor forms within the MGE, we next examined the expression of the LGE markers at early stages of development. A progressive expansion of LGE markers into the MGE was found between E11.5 and E13.5 (Figures 1E and 2A–2D), raising the possibility that corridor cells may migrate tangentially from the LGE to the MGE before TCAs reach this region. To test this hypothesis, we performed homotypic and isochronic transplants of LGE progenitor zones from transgenic embryos expressing green fluorescent protein (GFP) into wild-type host slices (Figure 2E). In addition to an expected striatal radial migration (Figure 2F), transplants generated a stream of GFP-positive cells migrating tangentially into the MGE (n = 17 at E12.5; n = 23 at E13.5) (Figures 2F and 2G). These cells displayed a morphology characteristic of tangentially migrating neurons in the developing telencephalon (Figure 2H) (Marín and Rubenstein, 2001Marín O. Rubenstein J.L.R. A long, remarkable journey: tangential migration in the telencephalon.Nat. Rev. Neurosci. 2001; 2: 780-790Crossref PubMed Scopus (790) Google Scholar) and expressed the LGE marker Islet1 (Figure 2I), reinforcing the idea that MGE corridor cells derive from the LGE. To confirm that the majority of corridor cells originate in the LGE, we mechanically blocked their ventral migration by inserting a semipermeable membrane between the LGE and the MGE in E11.5-E12 telencephalic slices (Figure 2J). After 48 hr in culture, the distribution of Islet1-expressing cells was normal in control slices (Figure 2K), whereas the insertion of a semipermeable membrane drastically reduced (n = 14) or abolished (n = 5) the presence of Islet1-positive cells in the MGE corridor (Figures 2L and 2L'). Taken together, our results show that the MGE corridor is largely generated by tangential migration from the LGE prior to the entrance of TCAs in the telencephalon. To investigate how this early LGE migration relates to TCAs pathfinding, we analyzed the ability of TCAs to grow into MGE- and LGE-derived territories using a slice coculture assay. In this assay, we dissected dorsal thalamic (dTh) explants from GFP-expressing embryonic brains and confronted them with wild-type telencephalic slices for 72–96 hr (Figure 2M). When confronted with the MGE, TCAs preferentially grew into the LGE-derived corridor, avoiding the MGE ventricular and subventricular zones (VZ and SVZ, respectively) and globus pallidus (n = 38) (Figures 2O and 2P). The apposition of dTh explants to the striatum showed a widespread axon invasion (n = 45) (Figure S2), demonstrating that this territory is highly permissive for the growth of TCAs. Thus, our in vitro assay reproduces the in vivo behavior of TCAs in the ventral telencephalon: highly fasciculated growth in the Islet1-positive corridor of the MGE, avoiding progenitors and derivatives, and widespread growth through the striatum. The preferential growth of TCAs through the LGE-derived corridor present in the MGE could be due to two nonexclusive mechanisms: (1) MGE-derived territories (i.e., VZ/SVZ and globus pallidus) are nonpermissive for TCAs; and (2) The corridor is specifically attractive for TCAs. To test these ideas, we first inserted small explants of the MGE VZ/SVZ (n = 8) or globus pallidus (n = 9) into the striatum and examined the behavior of GFP-positive TCAs after 72 hr in culture (Figure S2). TCAs grew normally through the striatum in control slices (n = 5), while they systematically avoided the heterotypic MGE VZ/SVZ (n = 8) or globus pallidus (n = 9) transplants (Figure S2). Thus, compared to the striatum, MGE progenitors and their derived territories are relatively nonpermissive to TCAs outgrowth (Figure S2). We next tested whether corridor cells could facilitate the growth of TCAs in an otherwise nonpermissive environment. In the experiments performed to validate our slice assays, we found that the most caudal part of the ventral telencephalon constitutes a nonpermissive territory for TCAs outgrowth (n = 7) (Figures 3A and 3B). In contrast, when a transplant containing corridor cells was grafted into the caudal ventral telencephalon, TCAs were found to invade the telencephalon specifically through the transplant, as visualized by Islet1 immunohistochemistry (n = 8) (Figures 3A, 3C, 3D, and 3D'). Thus, corridor cells are sufficient to provide a permissive environment for TCAs to cross a nonpermissive region. To test if corridor cells are required for the normal growth of TCAs, we performed a series of experiments in which we prevented the formation of the MGE corridor by mechanically blocking cell migration between the LGE and the MGE (Figure 3E). Telencephalic slices in which corridor formation was blocked by the insertion of a semipermeable membrane showed a drastic reduction in TCAs navigation in the MGE domain as compared to control slices (n = 8) (Figures 3F–3H). These experiments support an essential role for tangential migration of corridor cells in TCAs pathfinding. To establish the involvement of corridor cells in the guidance of TCAs in vivo, we searched for mouse mutants in which the development of corridor cells is affected. The Mash1 mutant constitutes an excellent candidate to test our hypothesis since loss of this transcription factor leads to a defect in the early development of the basal telencephalon that correlates with an abnormal pathfinding of TCAs (Casarosa et al., 1999Casarosa S. Fode C. Guillemot F. Mash1 regulates neurogenesis in the ventral telencephalon.Development. 1999; 126: 525-534Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, Tuttle et al., 1999Tuttle R. Nakagawa Y. Johnson J.E. O'Leary D.D. Defects in thalamocortical axon pathfinding correlate with altered cell domains in Mash-1-deficient mice.Development. 1999; 126: 1903-1916PubMed Google Scholar). We found that the MGE corridor does not form or is severely reduced in Mash1 mutant embryos (Figures 3I and 3J and data not shown), which may cause the initial blockage of TCAs at their entry point in the telencephalon (Figures 3K and 3L). Slice experiments showed that cell migration from the LGE is drastically impaired in Mash1 mutant embryos, most likely causing the observed defect in corridor formation (data not shown). Thus, Mash1 mutant slices represent a corridor-free system in which we could further test the role of these cells in TCAs pathfinding. As expected from our previous results, wild-type TCAs largely failed to transverse the MGE in rostral slices from Mash1 mutant embryos (n = 11) (Figures 3M and 3N). We next tested whether a graft of wild-type LGE progenitor zones—the origin of corridor cells—in Mash1 mutant slices could rescue the formation of the corridor in the MGE and thereby restore TCAs pathfinding. Wild-type LGE transplants gave rise to ventrally migrating cells in approximately half of the experiments (n = 13 out of 25 slices) (Figures 3O and 3P). In a vast majority of these experiments, migrating cells reached the dTh explants (n = 9 out of 13). Remarkably, formation of the corridor restored the growth of wild-type TCAs into the Mash1 mutant MGE territory (Figure 3O). Analysis of the nontransplanted side to the slice, used as a control, demonstrated that TCAs consistently fail to grow toward the cortex in the absence of the corridor (n = 25 out of 25 slices). Finally, since the MGE is also affected in Mash1 mutants (Casarosa et al., 1999Casarosa S. Fode C. Guillemot F. Mash1 regulates neurogenesis in the ventral telencephalon.Development. 1999; 126: 525-534Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), we performed additional control experiments in which wild-type MGE was homotypically transplanted in Mash1 mutant slices. MGE transplants restored the migration of interneurons from the MGE into the cortex (which is perturbed in Mash1 mutants; see Casarosa et al., 1999Casarosa S. Fode C. Guillemot F. Mash1 regulates neurogenesis in the ventral telencephalon.Development. 1999; 126: 525-534Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) but did not rescue the growth of TCAs through the ventral telencephalon (n = 24 slices) (Figure S3). In sum, this series of experiments indicates that the absence of LGE-derived corridor cells in Mash1 mutants specifically contributes to the inability of TCAs to extend through the MGE. Furthermore, they show that tangential migration of corridor cells is necessary and sufficient for the normal navigation of TCAs in the ventral telencephalon. We next investigated the molecular basis for the role of corridor cells in TCAs guidance. We have recently described that different isoforms of the Neuregulin-1 (Nrg1) gene act as short- and long-range attractants for migrating cortical interneurons (Flames et al., 2004Flames N. Long J.E. Garratt A.N. Fischer T.M. Gassmann M. Birchmeier C. Lai C. Rubenstein J.L. Marín O. Short- and long-range attraction of cortical GABAergic interneurons by neuregulin-1.Neuron. 2004; 44: 251-261Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (327) Google Scholar). Interestingly, we observed that the LGE-derived corridor found within the MGE expresses high levels of membrane bound isoforms of Nrg1 (CRD-Nrg1 or type III NRG1) (Figures 4A–4C), raising the possibility that CRD-NRG1 may participate in controlling TCAs navigation. To test this hypothesis, we adapted an assay in which the complete TCA pathway is preserved in a single slice culture (Agmon and Connors, 1991Agmon A. Connors B.W. Thalamocortical responses of mouse somatosensory (barrel) cortex in vitro.Neuroscience. 1991; 41: 365-379Crossref PubMed Scopus (537) Google Scholar) and placed aggregates of CRD-Nrg1-expressing COS cells in the ventral telencephalon prior to the entrance of TCAs in this territory (Figure 4E). TCAs that encountered COS cell aggregates expressing CRD-Nrg1 were diverted from their normal pathway (n = 21) (Figures 4I–JK), whereas control cell aggregates did not influence the guidance of TCAs (n = 28) (Figures 4F–4H). Thus, TCAs preferentially grow in contact with CRD-NRG1-expressing cells in slice cultures. To assess the function of CRD-NRG1 in the guidance of TCAs in vivo, we examined mutant embryos in which CRD-containing isoforms of NRG1 are disrupted through gene targeting, but diffusible NRG1 proteins (type I and type II NRG1, also known as Ig-NRG1 isoforms) are still produced (Wolpowitz et al., 2000Wolpowitz D. Mason T.B. Dietrich P. Mendelsohn M. Talmage D.A. Role L.W. Cysteine-rich domain isoforms of the neuregulin-1 gene are required for maintenance of peripheral synapses.Neuron. 2000; 25: 79-91Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (237) Google Scholar). We analyzed TCAs development in these mutant mice at E14.5 by placing crystals of DiI in the developing dTh. These experiments revealed a disorganized arrangement of TCAs as they progress through the MGE in CRD-Nrg1 mutants (n = 3) (Figures 4P, 4Q, and 4S) as compared to controls (n = 3) (Figures 4L, 4M, and 4O). Labeling of TCAs using L1 immunohistochemistry (Fukuda et al., 1997Fukuda T. Kawano H. Ohyama K. Li H.P. Takeda Y. Oohira A. Kawamura K. Immunohistochemical localization of neurocan and L1 in the formation of thalamocortical pathway of developing rats.J. Comp. Neurol. 1997; 382: 141-152Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) confirmed this observation (n = 3) (Figure S4) and showed that fewer TCAs reached the neocortex in CRD-Nrg1 mutants than controls (n = 3) (Figures 4N, 4O, 4R, and 4S). Thus, CRD-NRG1 expression in corridor cells contributes to the navigation of TCAs within the ventral telencephalon in vivo. The previous results prompted us to search for additional molecules that could contribute to the growth of TCAs even in the absence of the permissive substrate that CRD-NRG1 represents. Since Ig-Nrg1is expressed in the cortex at the time TCAs first enter the telencephalon (Figure 5A), we wondered whether the diffusible forms of NRG1 could also contribute to their guidance. To test this hypothesis, we cocultured E13.5 dTh explants with COS cells aggregates expressing Ig-Nrg1 in a three-dimensional matrix. In these experiments, axons did not specifically extend toward the source of NRG1, but instead Ig-NRG1 dramatically promoted their outgrowth (n = 21) (Figures 5B–5D and S5). This effect was observed independently of the type of three-dimensional matrix used and was reproduced by the purified EGF-like domain of human Ig-NRG1 (Figure S5). We next examined the consequences of loss of Ig-NRG1 in the outgrowth of TCAs within the telencephalon. Although Ig-Nrg1 expression is found throughout the cerebral cortex around E15.5 (Flames et al., 2004Flames N. Long J.E. Garratt A.N. Fischer T.M. Gassmann M. Birchmeier C. Lai C. Rubenstein J.L. Marín O. Short- and long-range attraction of cortical GABAergic interneurons by neuregulin-1.Neuron. 2004; 44: 251-261Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (327) Google Scholar), the domain of Ig-Nrg1 expression is largely confined to ventral and lateral divisions of the pallium when the earliest TCAs enter the telencephalon, around E13-E13.5 (Figure 5A). Based on this observation, we predicted that ablation of the VZ at the pallial/subpallial boundary—the “angle” region—would result in a reduction of secreted NRG1, thereby influencing TCAs in our slice culture system (Figure 5E). While in control experiments TCAs reached the cortex within 72 hr in culture (n = 8) (Figures 5F and 5H), complete angle ablations drastically affected axonal navigation, preventing TCAs to reach the cortex (n = 19 out of 21) (Figures 5G and 5H). These experiments suggest that the angle region contributes to the growth of TCAs through long-range factors since it influences axonal outgrowth long before they reach the pallium. To directly test if the TCA outgrowth blockage produced by the angle ablation was partly due to a reduction of Ig-NRG1 levels, we supplied angle-ablated slice cultures with exogenous Ig-Nrg1-expressing COS cells, placed in the lateral cortex or at the pallial/subpallial boundary (Figure 5I). While ablation experiments with control cells drastically affected TCA navigation (n = 16 out of 19) (Figures 5J and 5J' and data not shown), addition of Ig-Nrg1-expressing COS cells to the slice cultures rescued the growth of TCAs toward the cortex (n = 16 out of 27) (Figures 5K–L'). In addition, these experiments demonstrated that in a physiologically relevant context Ig-NRG1 controls the oriented growth of TCAs since laterally placed aggregates were able to partially derail growing axons from their normal trajectory to the neocortex (Figures 5K and 5K'). To reveal the contribution of Ig-NRG1 to the guidance of TCAs in vivo, we next analyzed embryos in which all forms of NRG1 were disrupted through gene targeting specifically restricted to the telencephalon. L1 staining and DiI tracing at E14 revealed that in the absence of telencephalic NRG1 TCAs entered the telencephalon as in controls but defasciculated through the MGE corridor and largely failed to progress toward the cortex (n = 3) (Figures 6 and S4). This defect was found to be partially persistent in neonatal embryos (n = 3) (Figure S6) and was not due to an absence of corridor formation, as shown by Islet1 expression in the Nrg1 mutant MGE (Figure S7). Altogether, these experiments suggest that CRD-NRG1 and Ig-NRG1 proteins cooperate in vivo to guide TCAs through the MGE corridor on their way to the neocortex. NRG1 directly binds to ErbB3 and ErbB4 receptors, which alone or in combination with ErbB2 mediate a large range of functions (Falls, 2003Falls D.L. Neuregulins: functions, forms, and signaling strategies.Exp. Cell Res. 2003; 284: 14-30Crossref PubMed Scopus (809) Google Scholar). ErbB4 receptors are expressed by thalamic neurons at the time they start extending their axons toward the telencephalon (Figure 4D and data not shown), suggesting that ErbB4 signaling may underlie the function of NRG1 in TCAs guidance. To test this hypothesis, we analyzed the thalamocortical projection by DiI tracing at E14 in a strain of ErbB4 mutant embryos (Tidcombe et al., 2003Tidcombe H. Jackson-Fisher A. Mathers K. Stern D.F. Gassmann M. Golding J.P. Neural and mammary gland defects in ErbB4 knockout mice genetically rescued from embryonic lethality.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2003; 100: 8281-8286Crossref PubMed Scopus (189) Google Scholar). As in the case of Nrg1 mutant embryos, TCAs largely failed to progress normally through the MGE in ErbB4 mutants, extending in all directions within ventral telencephalic region (n = 3) (Figures 7A–7F). Further analysis of ErbB4 mutants revealed that the migration of LGE-derived corridor cells to the MGE does not depend on ErbB4 function (Figure S7), suggesting that the observed defects were cause by a cell-autonomous mechanism. To directly test this, we performed two sets of experiments: (1) We expressed a dominant-negative form of ErbB4 (dnErbB4) in the dTh by focal electroporation in embryonic slices (Figure 7G); and (2) We recombined wild-type telencephalic slices with dTh explants from ErbB4 mutant embryos (Figure 7J). In control electroporation experiments (n = 26) (Figure 7H) or recombination experiments (n = 10 out of 10 slices) (Figures 7K), axons formed a tight organized bundle in the ventral telencephalon before reaching the cortex. In contrast, in slices electroporated with dnErbB4, axons failed to organize in a compact bundle through the MGE, navigating randomly in all directions within the ventral telencephalon (n = 27) (Figure 7I). Similarly, axons derived from ErbB4 mutant explants largely fail to reach the neocortex (n = 22 out of 23 slices) (Figures 7L). Thus, loss of ErbB4 function in the dTh resulted in a similar phenotype to the ErbB4 mutant, in which TCAs enter the telencephalon but fail to progress efficiently toward the cortex (Figures 7C and 7F). Altogether, these results strongly suggest that ErbB4 signaling in TCAs is required for their proper navigation in the ventral telencephalon and are in agreement with the hypothesis that ErbB4 mediates the"
https://openalex.org/W2030572014,"In many organisms, meiotic chromosomes are bundled at their telomeres to form a ""bouquet"" arrangement. The bouquet formation plays an important role in homologous chromosome pairing and therefore progression of meiosis. As meiotic telomere clustering occurs in response to mating pheromone signaling in fission yeast, we looked for factors essential for bouquet formation among genes induced under mating pheromone signaling. This genome-wide search identified two proteins, Bqt1 and Bqt2, that connect telomeres to the spindle-pole body (SPB; the centrosome equivalent in fungi). Neither Bqt1 nor Bqt2 alone functions as a connector, but together the two proteins form a bridge between Rap1 (a telomere protein) and Sad1 (an SPB protein). Significantly, when both Bqt1 and Bqt2 are ectopically expressed in mitotic cells, they also form a bridge between Rap1 and Sad1. Thus, a complex including Bqt1 and Bqt2 is essential for connecting telomeres to the SPB."

By solving structures of reaction intermediates at near-atomic resolution, we have identified the reaction pathway for tryptamine oxidation by aromatic amine dehydrogenase. Combining experiment and computer simulation, we show proton transfer occurs predominantly to oxygen O2 of Asp 128 β in a reaction dominated by tunneling over ∼0.6 angstroms. The role of long-range coupled motions in promoting tunneling is controversial. We show that, in this enzyme system, tunneling is promoted by a short-range motion modulating proton-acceptor distance and no long-range coupled motion is required."
https://openalex.org/W2083128576,"Most RNA molecules require Mg(2+) for their structure and enzymatic properties. Here we report the first example of an RNA serving as sensor for cytoplasmic Mg(2+). We establish that expression of the Mg(2+) transporter MgtA of Salmonella enterica serovar Typhimurium is controlled by its 5' untranslated region (5'UTR). We show that the 5'UTR of the mgtA gene can adopt different stem-loop structures depending on the Mg(2+) levels, which determine whether transcription reads through into the mgtA coding region or stops within the 5'UTR. We could recapitulate the Mg(2+)-regulated transcription using a defined in vitro transcription system with RNA polymerase as the only protein component. The initiation of mgtA transcription responds to extracytoplasmic Mg(2+) and its elongation into the coding region to cytoplasmic Mg(2+), providing a singular example in which the same ligand is sensed in different cellular compartments to regulate disparate steps in gene transcription."

Cyanidin-3-glucoside (C3G), a compound found in blackberry and other food products, was shown to possess chemopreventive and chemotherapeutic activity in the present study. In cultured JB6 cells, C3G was able to scavenge ultraviolet B-induced ·OH and O2_˙ radicals. In vivo studies indicated that C3G treatment decreased the number of non-malignant and malignant skin tumors per mouse induced by 12-O-tetradecanolyphorbol-13-acetate (TPA) in 7,12-dimethylbenz[a]anthracene-initiated mouse skin. Pretreatment of JB6 cells with C3G inhibited UVB- and TPA-induced transactivation of NF-κB and AP-1 and expression of cyclooxygenase-2 and tumor necrosis factor-α. These inhibitory effects appear to be mediated through the inhibition of MAPK activity. C3G also blocked TPA-induced neoplastic transformation in JB6 cells. In addition, C3G inhibited proliferation of a human lung carcinoma cell line, A549.

Chemoprevention, the use of drugs or natural substances to retard or reverse the process of carcinogenesis, represents one of several promising strategies to reduce the development of cancer. Many naturally occurring substances present in the human diet have been identified as potential chemopreventive and/or chemotherapeutic agents (1Ross J.A. Kasum C.M. Annu. Rev.

In a search for better chemopreventive or chemotherapeutic agents, we isolated cyanidin-3-glucoside (C3G) from blackberries (8Zheng W. Wang S.Y. J. Agric. Food Chem. 2003; 51: 502-509Crossref PubMed Scopus (662) Google Scholar). C3G belongs to the flavonoid class of molecules and is a member of the anthocyanin family, the largest group of pigments present in many edible berries, dark grapes, cabbages, and other pigmented foods. Evidence suggests that anthocyanins may serve as natural antioxidants (9Bagchi D. Sen C.K. Bagchi M. Atala M. Biochemistry (Moscow). 2004; 69: 75-80Crossref PubMed Scopus (331) Google Scholar). Anthocyanins repair and protect genomic DNA integrity. Studies have shown that berry anthocyanins are beneficial in reducing age-associated oxidative stress, as well as in improving neuronal and cognitive brain function. Early studies have shown that supplementations with berries rich in anthocyanins were effective in reducing oxidative stress associated with aging, and were beneficial in reversing age-related neuronal and behavioral changes (9Bagchi D.

Over the past decades, extensive efforts have been made to develop targeted therapies that can inhibit or prevent tumorigenesis. In this regard, AP-1, NF-κB, MAPKs, COX-2, and TNFα represent the most promising pharmacological targets that have been identified (7Ding M. Lu Y. Bowman L. Huang C. Leonard S. Wang L.

Activation of those targets/pathways has been shown to be involved in tumor growth and development (14Afaq F. Ahmad N. Mukhtar H. Oncogene. 2003; 22: 9254-9264Crossref PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar, 15Adler V. Pincus M.R. Polotskaya A. Montano X. Friedman F.K. Ronai Z. J. Biol.

Previous studies have reported that both AP-1 and NF-κB are known to be involved in transcriptional regulation of matrix metalloproteinase, angiogenic enzymes that play an important role in malignant cancer cells invasion and metastasis (17Chung T.W. Moon S.K. Chang Y.C. Ko J.H. Lee Y.C. Cho G. Kim S.H. Kim J.G. Kim C.H. FASEB J. 2004; 18: 1670-1681Crossref PubMed Scopus (362) Google Scholar). AP-1 and NF-κB also up-regulate the expression of urokinase-type plasminogen activator (uPA) and its receptor (uPAR). The inhibition of NF-κB and AP-1 suppressed the secretion of uPA, resulting in the inhibition of motility of highly invasive breast cancer cells (18Sliva D. Curr. Cancer Drug Targets. 2004; 4: 327-336Crossref PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar). Increased AP-1 activity is associated with malignant transformation and the action of cancer-promoting agents (15Adler V. Pincus M.R. Polotskaya A. Montano X. Friedman F.K. Ronai Z. J. Biol.

Colburn N.H. Cancer Res. 1997; 57: 3569-3576PubMed Google Scholar). Moreover, a recent study using transgenic mice has demonstrated that AP-1 transactivation is required for tumor promotion (20Young M.R. Li J.J. Rincon M. Flavell R.A. Sathyanarayana B.K. Hunziker R. Colburn N.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 9827-9832Crossref PubMed Scopus (369) Google Scholar). COX-2 and TNFα are also important targets for modulating inflammation and carcinogenesis. TNFα inhibitors display a significant effect in retarding inflammatory disease and carcinogenesis (21Sturm J.W. Magdeburg R. Berger K. Petruch B. Samel S. Bonninghoff R. Keese M. Hafner M. Post S. Int. J. Cancer. 2003; 107: 11-21Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). COX-2, a catalyst in prostaglandin synthesis from arachidonic acid, contributes to the regulation of angiogenesis and metastasis (22Dannenberg A.J. Altorki N.K. Boyle J.O. Dang C. Howe L.R.

Selective COX-2 inhibitors protect against the formation of tumors in animals, suggesting that prostaglandins, the products of COX-2 activity, substantially contribute to carcinogenesis (24Reddy B.S. Maruyama H. Kelloff G. Cancer Res. 1987; 47: 5340-5346PubMed Google Scholar, 25Castonguay A. Rioux N. Carcinogenesis. 1997; 18: 491-496Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar, 26Rigas B. Kashfi K. J. Pharmacol. Exp. Ther. 2005; 314: 1-8Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). Overexpression of COX-2 is common in human lung cancer and seems to be associated with tumor progression, invasion, and metastasis. In experimental animal models, COX-2 has been shown to be involved in tumor angiogenesis, suggesting that COX-2 is a potential target for cancer therapy. Several in vivo studies have already shown that COX-2-specific inhibitors (celecoxib and rofecoxib) have antitumor activity, and clinical trials using COX-2 inhibitors are currently ongoing in patients with lung caner (27Spano J.P. Chouahnia K. Morere J.F. Bull. Cancer. 2004; 91: 109-112Google Scholar, 28Aggarwal B.B. Kumar A. Bharti A.C. Anticancer Res. 2003; 23: 363-398PubMed Google Scholar). Reports focusing on mechanisms and in vivo data supporting the possible chemopreventive and chemotherapeutic effects of purified C3G are limited. In light of the important roles of NF-κB, AP-1, COX-2, TNFα, and MAPK activation in carcinogenesis, we investigated the potential ability of C3G to inhibit DMBA-TPA-induced skin papillomas in animal skin model, suppress proliferation of tumor cells, suppress tumor xenograft growth and metastasis in nude mice, down-regulate NF-κB, AP-1, and MAPK activities, down-regulate the expression of COX-2 and TNFα, and scavenge ROS generated in intact cells. The results of this investigation provide new insights into the mechanisms by which a natural antioxidant may control the production of ROS-induced activation of molecular signals involved in the initiation, promotion, and progression of cancer.

Human lung carcinoma cells, A549, were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 10% FBS. The cells were grown at 37 °C in a 5% CO2 atmosphere. Isolation of C3G from Blackberries—High performance liquid chromatography was used to separate and isolate C3G from blackberry fruit tissue. The detailed method for preparation of C3G has been described elsewhere (8Zheng W. Wang S.Y. J. Agric. Food Chem. 2003; 51: 502-509Crossref PubMed Scopus (662) Google Scholar). Briefly, fruit samples were extracted twice with 80% methanol and 0.01% HCl in a Polytron™ homogenizer for 1 min. The concentrated extract was dissolved in acidified water (0.01% HCl) and then passed through a C18 Sep-Pak™ cartridge. C3G and other anthocyanins were adsorbed onto the column and then recovered from the cartridge with acidified (0.01% HCl) methanol. The methanol extract was passed through a 0.45-μm membrane filter and further separated by a Waters Corp. high performance liquid chromatography system coupled with a photodiode array detector. The C3G-containing fraction was collected, lyophilized, and stored at -80 °C for later use. Isolation of C3G as described by this method was 99% pure. Assay of Total Antioxidant Capacity—The total antioxidant capacity of C3G was determined using an ABTS (2,2′-aziodiethylbenzthiazoline sulfonate) test set (Randox Laboratories Ltd., UK). The principle of the assay depends on production of the radical cation ABTS+ in incubation medium containing the substrates H2O and peroxidase. ABTS+ has a blue-green color, which can be detected at 600 nm. The assays were calibrated against standards and expressed as micromoles per liter. Cellular O2_˙ and H2O2 Assay—Dihydroethidium and carboxymethyl dichlorofluorescein diacetate (CM-DCFDA) are specific dyes used for staining O2_˙ and H2O2 produced by intact cells (31Zamzami N.

JB6 cells (2 × 104/well) were seeded onto a glass coverslip in the bottom of a well of a 24-well plate for 24 h. The cells were pretreated with or without C3G for 30 min and exposed to UVB radiation (4 kJ/m2). At the end of the stimulation, dihydroethidium or CM-DCFDA were added at a final concentration of 5 μm for 30 min. After the incubation, the cells were washed with phosphate-buffered saline and mounted on coverslips. A Zeiss LSM 510 microscope was used to obtain images. Scale bars were generated and inserted by using LSM software.

The mice were monitored free of specific pathogens housed in plastic filter-top cages on corncob bedding, provided autoclaved tap water and Prolab 3500 feed ad libitum. Both male and female mice (6-9 weeks old) were used in groups numbering 19 to 24. Dorsal skin of the mice was shaved. A single dose of 400 nmol of 7,12-dimethylbenz[a]anthracene (DMBA) dissolved in 300 μl of acetone was applied. Two weeks following initiation, the mice (except the negative control group) were promoted by dermal exposure to 17 nmol of TPA in 350 μl of acetone twice a week for 21 weeks. For the C3G-treated group, the dorsal skin was pretreated topically with C3G (3.5 μm/mouse) 30 min before each application of TPA. The negative control group was treated with acetone only. The incidence of papillomas was detected by palpation, and the number of papillomas appearing on each mouse was recorded once a week. At the end of the experiment, all the animals were sacrificed by intraperitoneal injection of pentobarbital (6.5 mg/mouse). For histopathology, the largest tumors were removed and fixed in freshly prepared 4% paraformaldehyde followed by paraffin embedding and subjected to pathologic evaluation. Anchorage-independent Transformation Assay—The inhibitory effects of C3G on TPA-induced cell transformation were investigated in JB6 cells. Cells (1 × 104) were suspended in 2 ml of 0.38% agar medium over 3 ml of 0.5% agar medium containing 10% FBS, 20 ng/ml TPA with or without C3G (5-80 μm). The cultures were maintained in a 37 °C, 5% CO2 incubator for 14 days, and the anchorage-independent colonies were scored by a computerized image analyzer. Mouse Model Study for Tumor Xenograft Growth and Metastasis— Male nu/nu homozygous nude mice (Crl: NU-Foxn1nu, 8 weeks old) purchased from Charles River Laboratories Inc. (Wilmington, MA). The mice were grouped in 10 mice per group and housed in autoclaved plastic filter-top cages and were provided with autoclaved tap water and Prolab 3500 feed ad libitum. Human lung carcinoma cells, A549, were harvested from tissue culture and subcutaneously injected (2 × 106 cells/flank) in both the right and left flanks of each mouse to initiate tumor growth. Two days after cell implantation, the mice were treated intraperitoneal with either PBS or C3G dissolved in PBS (9.5 mg/kg, 3 times/week). Once tumor xenografts started growing, their sizes were determined by measuring tumor size with calipers twice weekly in two dimensions throughout the study. The tumor volume was calculated by the formula, 0.5236 × L1 × (L2)2, where L1 is the long diameter and L2 is the short diameter. The tumor volume (mm3) is represented as the mean of 10 mice in each group. Transwell Cell Migration Assay—The assay was performed according to the methods described previously (31Zamzami N. Marchetti P. Castedo M. Decaudin D. Macho A. Hirsch T. Susin S.A. Petit P.X. Mignotte B. Kroemer G. J. Exp. Med. 1995; 182: 367-377Crossref PubMed Scopus (1438) Google Scholar). The cells were serumstarved overnight, and the Transwells were coated with enhanced chemiluminescence cell attachment matrix (Upstate Biotechnology) at 20 μg/ml. The top chambers of the Transwells were loaded with 0.2 ml of cells (4 × 105cells/ml) in serum-free media, and the bottom chambers contained 0.6 ml of Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium with 0.5% FCS. The cells were incubated in Transwells at 37 °C in 5% CO2 in the presence or absence of C3G for 12 h. Migrating cells were fixed and stained with 0.1% crystal violet, followed by dye elution. The microplate reader was used to measure the optical density of the eluted solutions to determine the migration values. Wound Healing Assay—The wound healing assays were conducted according to the methods described previously (32Qian Y. Luo J. Leonard S.S. Harris G.K. Millecchia L. Flynn D.C. Shi X. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 16189-16197Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). A549 cells were grown on coverslips to 100% confluent monolayer and then scratched to form a 100-μm “wound” using sterile pipette tips. The cells were then cultured in the presence or absence of C3G in serum-free media for 12 h and fixed on coverslips with 4% formalin. The images were recorded using an Olympus photomicroscope. Cell Invasion Assay—The cell invasion assays were performed according to the methods described previously (32Qian Y. Luo J. Leonard S.S. Harris G.K. Millecchia L. Flynn D.C. Shi X. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 16189-16197Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). A549 cells were cultured in serum-free media overnight. The cells (5 × 104 cells) were loaded on pre-coated Matrigel 24-well invasion chambers (BD Biosciences) in the presence or absence of C3G. Then 0.5 ml of 5% fetal calf serum medium was added to the wells of the plate to serve as the chemoattractant for the cells. The Matrigel invasion chambers were incubated for 18 h. The invading cells were fixed with 10% formalin, stained with Harris modified hematoxylin (Fisher), and analyzed according to manufacturer's instructions. Statistics—Data presented are the means ± S.E. of n assays as noted in the figure legends. Significant differences were determined using the Student's t test. Significance was set at p ≤ 0.05. Total Antioxidant Capacity of C3G—ROS have been known to be associated with many diseases. ROS are associated not only with initiation, but also with promotion and progression in the multistage carcinogenesis mode (33Seifried H.E. McDonald S.S. Anderson D.E. Greenwald P. Milner J.A. Cancer Res. 2003; 63: 4295-4298PubMed Google Scholar, 34Benhar M. Engelberg D. Levitzki A. EMBO Rep. 2002; 5: 420-425Crossref Scopus (538) Google Scholar). In light of the important role of ROS in tumor promoter-induced AP-1 activation, transformation, and progression, we measured the total antioxidant capacity of C3G using the Randox reagent set. As show in Fig. 1A, C3G displayed a stronger antioxidant activity than that of ascorbic acid over the same concentration range, suggesting that C3G can effectively scavenge ROS. Scavenging of H2O and O2_˙ Generation by C3G—To confirm the ROS-scavenging activity of C3G, the effect of C3G on UVB-induced H2O2 and O2_˙ generated in intact cells was tested. H2O2 and O2_˙ generation was analyzed using intracellular staining by CM-H2-DCFDA and dihydroethidium. CM-H2-DCFDA is a specific fluorescent dye for H2O2, and dihydroethidium is specific for O2_˙. JB6 cells were pretreated with or without C3G for 30 min and then exposed to UVB (4 kj/m2). The generation of H2O2 and O2_˙ was monitored by confocal microscopy. As shown in Fig. 1 (B and C), the generation of H2O2 and O2_˙ by UVB was completely inhibited by addition of C3G at 20 μm and 40 μm, respectively. Inhibition of AP-1, NF-κB, COX-2, and TNFα Activation/Expression by C3G—Previous studies have shown that AP-1, NF-κB, COX-2, and TNFα play an important role in carcinogenesis (7Ding M. Lu Y.

We tested the effects of C3G on UVB- and TPA-induced transactivation of AP-1 and NF-κB, and expression of COX-2 and TNFα using a reporter gene assay in JB6 cells. The results indicated that pretreatment of the cells with various concentrations of C3G produced a dose-dependent decrease in AP-1, NF-κB, COX-2, and TNFα activity/expression induced by either UVB irradiation or TPA (Fig. 2, A-D). The induction of COX-2 expression was confirmed by Western blot analysis (Fig. 2C, bottom panel). The inhibitory actions of C3G were not caused by cytotoxicity, because the concentration range that inhibited AP-1, NF-κB, COX-2, and TNFα activity/expression did not affect cell proliferation as measured by the electric cell-substrate impedance sensor assay (data not shown).FIGURE 2Effects of C3G on UVB- and TPA-induced AP-1, NF-κB, COX-2, TNFα, and MAPK activation/expression. The JB6 cells, which were stably transfected with the AP-1, NF-κB, COX-2, or TNFα luciferase reporter plasmid, were pretreated with C3G for 1 h followed by exposure with TPA (20 ng/ml) or UVB radiation (4 kJ/m2) for 24 h. The relative AP-1 (A) and NF-κB(B) activity, and the relative COX-2 (C) and TNFα expression (D) were measured by the luciferase assay. Results, presented as relative activity/expression compared with untreated control cells, are given as means ± S.E. from three assay wells.

MAPK pathways, including ERK, JNK, and p38 kinase, are involved in up-regulation of AP-1 and NF-κB activity and subsequence expression of TNFα and COX-2 by increasing the abundance of the components and/or altering the phosphorylation of their subunits (35Paik J. Lee J.Y. Hwang D. Adv. Exp. Med. Biol. 2002; 507: 503-508Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar, 36Karin M. Ann. N. Y. Acad. Sci. 1998; 851: 139-146Crossref PubMed Scopus (292) Google Scholar). The results indicated that C3G suppressed UVB- and TPA-induced phosphorylation of p38, ERK, and JNK (Fig. 3A), as well as the upstream regulator, MKK4 (Fig. 3B), in a dose-dependent manner. These results suggest that the mechanism by which C3G inhibits AP-1 transactivation may involve early inhibition of ERK, JNK, and p38 signaling cascades. C3G Inhibits TPA-induced JB6 Cell Transformation—Earlier studies have indicated that AP-1 and/or NF-κB activation is required in neoplastic transformation and tumorigenesis in JB6 cells (19Li J.J. Westergaad C. Ghosh P. Colburn N.H. Cancer Res. 1997; 57: 3569-3576PubMed Google Scholar, 20Young M.R. Li J.J. Rincon M. Flavell R.A. Sathyanarayana B.K. Hunziker R. Colburn N.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 9827-9832Crossref PubMed Scopus (369) Google Scholar). We thus tested the effect of C3G on TPA-induced cell transformation using the soft agar assay. The result is shown in Fig. 4A. TPA-induced cell transformation was significantly inhibited by C3G at the concentration range from 10 to 40 μm. At the concentration of 80 μm C3G, the TPA-induced transformation was completely abolished. Inhibition of Papillomagenesis and Malignant Transformation by C3G—To further study the antitumorigenic activity of C3G in vivo, we evaluated the effect of C3G on the two-stage mouse skin tumor model in which DMBA was used as initiator and TPA as promoter ("

In turn, cytokinesis cleaves the cell between the separated chromosomes. What ensures that cytokinesis proceeds only after that all chromosome arms are pulled out of the cleavage plane was unknown. Here, we show that a signaling pathway, which we call NoCut, delays the completion of cytokinesis in cells with spindle-midzone defects. NoCut depends on the Aurora kinase Ipl1 and the anillin-related proteins Boi1 and Boi2, which localize to the site of cleavage in an Ipl1-dependent manner and act as abscission inhibitors. Inactivation of NoCut leads to premature abscission and chromosome breakage by the cytokinetic machinery and is lethal in cells with spindle-elongation defects. We propose that NoCut monitors clearance of chromatin from the midzone to ensure that cytokinesis completes only after all chromosomes have migrated to the poles.

We propose that NoCut monitors clearance of chromatin from the midzone to ensure that cytokinesis completes only after all chromosomes have migrated to the poles. Mitosis is a highly coordinated process in which the two copies of each chromosome (sister chromatids) are segregated away from each other to opposite poles of the cell. Subsequently, the cell is cleaved between the two newly formed nuclei, leading to two independent cells. To ensure that each daughter cell inherits a single and complete copy of the genome, chromosome segregation and cell division are tightly coordinated. The fidelity of these events is ensured by complex surveillance mechanisms that detect and correct errors (for review, see Hartwell and Weinert, 1989Hartwell L.H. Weinert T.A. Checkpoints: controls that ensure the order of cell cycle events.Science. 1989; 246: 629-634Crossref PubMed Scopus (2341) Google Scholar). The spindle checkpoint, together with kinetochore proteins and the kinase Aurora B (Ipl1 in yeast), ensures that chromosome segregation begins only after each pair of sister chromatids achieves bipolar attachment to the mitotic spindle (Musacchio and Hardwick, 2002Musacchio A. Hardwick K.G. The spindle checkpoint: structural insights into dynamic signalling.Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2002; 3: 731-741Crossref PubMed Scopus (459) Google Scholar). Chromosome segregation is then fulfilled by elongation of the anaphase spindle. Elongation is supported by the spindle midzone, which bundles antiparallel nonkinetochore spindle microtubules (Glotzer, 2005Glotzer M. The molecular requirements for cytokinesis.Science. 2005; 307: 1735-1739Crossref PubMed Scopus (550) Google Scholar, McCollum, 2004McCollum D. Cytokinesis: The central spindle takes center stage.Curr. Biol. 2004; 14: R953-R955Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). Numerous molecules localize to the spindle midzone. The microtubule-bundling protein PRC1 (Ase1 in budding yeast) is required for spindle stability. In addition, a number of yeast kinetochore components such as Ndc10, Ndc80, and Slk19 and the chromosomal passenger proteins Aurora B, INCENP, and survivin (Ipl1, Sli15, and Bir1 in budding yeast) also localize to the midzone (Adams et al., 2001Adams R.R.

Orchestrating anaphase and mitotic exit: separase cleavage and localization of Slk19.Nat. Cell Biol. 2001; 3: 771-777Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar). When the spindle becomes longer than twice the longest chromosome arm, chromosome segregation is achieved. Cytokinesis, the final step of cell division, physically dissociates the two daughter cells from each other (Glotzer, 2005Glotzer M. The molecular requirements for cytokinesis.Science. 2005; 307: 1735-1739Crossref PubMed Scopus (550) Google Scholar, Guertin et al., 2002Guertin D.A. Trautmann S. McCollum D. Cytokinesis in eukaryotes.Microbiol. Mol. Biol. Rev. 2002; 66: 155-178Crossref PubMed Scopus (208) Google Scholar). In animal cells, cytokinesis starts with contraction of the equatorial actomyosin ring, leading to membrane furrowing. As furrow ingression completes, the cells remain linked by a cytoplasmic bridge containing the remnant of the spindle midzone, the midbody. The actomyosin ring then disassembles while resolution of the plasma membrane, called abscission, completes cytokinesis. In animal cells, spindle-midzone defects generally cause the furrow to regress, leading to the formation of binucleated cells (Glotzer, 2005Glotzer M. The molecular requirements for cytokinesis.Science. 2005; 307: 1735-1739Crossref PubMed Scopus (550) Google Scholar, Guertin et al., 2002Guertin D.A. Trautmann S. McCollum D.

Biol. 2004; 14: R953-R955Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). Cases of furrow regression have also been described in cells with incomplete DNA segregation (Meraldi et al., 2004aMeraldi P. Draviam V.M. Sorger P.K. Timing and checkpoints in the regulation of mitotic progression.Dev. Cell. 2004; 7: 45-60Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (377) Google Scholar, Mullins and Biesele, 1977Mullins J.M. Biesele J.J. Terminal phase of cytokinesis in D-98s cells.J. Cell Biol. 1977; 73: 672-684Crossref PubMed Scopus (196) Google Scholar). However, it is not clear how and why defects in DNA segregation lead to cytokinesis failure. Like in animal cells, yeast cytokinesis is a multistep process that also starts with the assembly and contraction of an actomyosin ring. Contraction depends on activation of the mitotic exit network (MEN) and Cdk1 inactivation (for review, see Tolliday et al., 2001Tolliday N. Bouquin N. Li R. Assembly and regulation of the cytokinetic apparatus in budding yeast.Curr. Opin. Microbiol. 2001; 4: 690-695Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). After contraction, the ring disassembles and the narrow cytoplasmic bridge left between the two daughter cells is resolved by abscission (Dobbelaere and Barral, 2004Dobbelaere J. Barral Y. Spatial coordination of cytokinetic events by compartmentalization of the cell cortex.Science. 2004; 305: 393-396Crossref PubMed Scopus (217) Google Scholar). Three independent molecular pathways fulfill these events. Type II myosin, Myo1, ensures actomyosin ring contraction. Hof1, homologous to Schizosaccharomyces pombe Cdc15p, defines a second pathway required for proper actin organization and septation. The third and least understood pathway depends on the protein Cyk3 and acts downstream of actomyosin ring contraction in septation and perhaps abscission. Inactivation of either of the MYO1, HOF1, or CYK3 genes affects cytokinesis only mildly, whereas simultaneous disruption of any two of them abolishes cytokinesis and is lethal (Korinek et al., 2000Korinek W.S. Bi E. Epp J.A. Wang L. Ho J. Chant J. Cyk3, a novel SH3-domain protein, affects cytokinesis in yeast.Curr. Biol. 2000; 10: 947-950Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar, Tolliday et al., 2001Tolliday N. Bouquin N. Li R. Assembly and regulation of the cytokinetic apparatus in budding yeast.Curr. Opin. Microbiol. 2001; 4: 690-695Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). Here, we investigate how cytokinesis is coordinated with anaphase. We show that similar to animal cells, yeast spindle-midzone defects prevent the completion of cytokinesis. Abscission inhibition depended on NoCut, a signaling pathway that involved the Aurora kinase, Ipl1, and the anillin-related proteins Boi1 and Boi2. Inactivation of this pathway causes chromosome breakage due to precocious abscission. Thus, our results provide a model for how the timing of cytokinesis is coordinated with chromosome segregation. In animal cells, spindle-midzone defects lead to cytokinesis failure. We therefore investigated whether the midzone is also required for cytokinesis in budding yeast. The microtubule binding protein Ase1, the homolog of human PRC1, is the only yeast protein known to localize exclusively to the spindle midzone. Yeast cells lacking Ase1 are viable and form highly unstable spindles that break down prematurely during anaphase (Schuyler et al., 2003Schuyler S.C. Liu J.Y. Pellman D. The molecular function of Ase1p: evidence for a MAP-dependent midzone-specific spindle matrix. Microtubule-associated proteins.J. Cell Biol. 2003; 160: 517-528Crossref PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar). Tetrad analysis demonstrated that cells lacking Myo1 and Hof1 depend on Ase1 for survival, indicating that Ase1 is required for cytokinesis and suggesting that it may function in the Cyk3 pathway (data not shown). In support of this conclusion, the ase1Δ cyk3Δ double mutant was fully viable. These data indicate that Ase1 or the spindle midzone participates in yeast cytokinesis. To characterize the role of Ase1 in cytokinesis, we visualized the plasma membrane at the bud neck of dividing ase1Δ cells using Ras2-GFP as a marker (Whistler and Rine, 1997Whistler J.L. Rine J. Ras2 and Ras1 protein phosphorylation in Saccharomyces cerevisiae.J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 18790-18800Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). Cells that had initiated anaphase were identified by the fact that they had one spindle pole body (SPB) in the mother cell and the other in the bud. SPBs were visualized using Spc42-CFP as a marker. In ana-/telophase cells, the plasma membrane at the bud neck was in one of three states (Figure 1A): continuous (“open” neck, in which the furrow has not ingressed), contracted (the furrow had ingressed), or resolved into two (indicating that abscission was completed but mother cells had not yet separated from their buds). To determine which stage of cytokinesis was affected in ase1Δ mutants, we quantified the frequency of these different classes in asynchronous wild-type and ase1Δ cultures (Figure 1B). In wild-type, 45% of the ana- and telophase cells had not yet undergone contraction, while in 52% of the cells the membrane was clearly resolved into two. Only about 3% of the cells showed a “pinched” neck, in which the membrane had ingressed. The small fraction of cells with pinched bud necks reflects the short interval between furrow ingression and membrane resolution in wild-type cells. This category of cells was specifically and strongly increased (8-fold) in the ase1Δ population (Figure 1B). Thus, furrow ingression progressed properly but membrane resolution was delayed in the ase1Δ cells. These data are consistent with Ase1 acting in cytokinesis posterior to actomyosin ring contraction, most likely in abscission. To further analyze the role of Ase1, we created a conditional ASE1 shut-off allele. The Ase1 promoter was replaced by a weak version of the regulatable GAL promoter (GALS; Janke et al., 2004Janke C. Magiera M.M. Rathfelder N. Taxis C. Reber S. Maekawa H. Moreno-Borchart A. Doenges G. Schwob E. Schiebel E. Knop M. A versatile toolbox for PCR-based tagging of yeast genes: new fluorescent proteins, more markers and promoter substitution cassettes.Yeast. 2004; 21: 947-962Crossref PubMed Scopus (1225) Google Scholar), which allowed Ase1 synthesis to be turned on to appropriate levels in galactose and turned off in glucose media. Accordingly, GALS:HA-ASE1 cells did not contain detectable levels of HA-Ase1 protein when grown in glucose medium (Figure 1C). In these cells, the spindle failed to elongate and broke down prematurely compared to wild-type cells (see Figure 6B). Thus, the GALS:HA-ASE1 allele allowed efficient depletion of Ase1 within a single cell cycle, consistent with Ase1 being unstable in G1 (Juang et al., 1997Juang Y.L. Huang J. Peters J.M. McLaughlin M.E. Tai C.Y. Pellman D. APC-mediated proteolysis of Ase1 and the morphogenesis of the mitotic spindle.Science. 1997; 275: 1311-1314Crossref PubMed Scopus (212) Google Scholar). Similar to the ase1Δ mutant cells, the GALS:HA-ASE1 cells delayed abscission upon shifting to the repressing medium (Figure 1B). In addition, a high fraction of GALS:HA-ASE1 cells formed chains that failed to separate, where primary septa failed to form properly, as indicated by chitin staining (Figure 1E). These cells were not merely kept together by cell wall remnants but rather by a continuous plasma membrane, since digestion of the cell wall using zymolyase failed to dissociate the chains (Figure 1D). Together, these data indicate that Ase1 function is required for efficient resolution of the plasma membrane after furrow ingression and hence for proper abscission. The cytokinesis defect observed in cells lacking Ase1 suggested that the spindle midzone is involved in the control of abscission. Alternatively, cytokinesis might have been repressed until completion of chromosome segregation, which is delayed in these cells (Figure 7A). To distinguish between these possibilities, we tested whether mutations that impair chromosome segregation also impair cell cleavage. Kinetochore components fall into two classes relative to chromosome separation and spindle function. Ndc10, an inner kinetochore component, also localizes to the spindle midzone during anaphase and is required for both kinetochore assembly and midzone stability (Bouck and Bloom, 2005Bouck D.C. Bloom K.S. The kinetochore protein Ndc10p is required for spindle stability and cytokinesis in yeast.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2005; 102: 5408-5413Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar, Buvelot et al., 2003Buvelot S. Tatsutani S.Y. Vermaak D. Biggins S. The budding yeast Ipl1/Aurora protein kinase regulates mitotic spindle disassembly.J. Cell Biol. 2003; 160: 329-339Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar; see Figures S1A and S1B in the Supplemental Data available with this article online). Using the midzone marker Slk19, we found that the central kinetochore component Ndc80 falls in the same category (Figure 2A). In contrast, the central kinetochore proteins Nnf1 and Mtw1 were required only for chromosome attachment to the spindle and not for midzone formation (Figures 2A and 2B). Progression of the ndc80-1, nnf1-17, and mtw1-1 mutants through anaphase was obtained by deleting the MAD2 gene. Analysis of bud formation indicated that all strains entered and exited mitosis with similar kinetics as wild-type (Figure S1C and data not shown). Inactivation of kinetochore function in nnf1-17 mad2Δ and mtw1-1 mad2Δ double mutants resulted in little or no DNA being pulled into the bud upon anaphase and led to an increased number of cells that rebudded without separating from their first bud (Figure 2B). However, these mutants were not defective in cytokinesis because the bibudded cells were efficiently resolved by zymolyase treatment. Thus, the nnf1-17 mad2Δ and mtw1-1 mad2Δ double mutants completed cytokinesis but were defective in the subsequent degradation of the primary septum. In contrast, the ndc10-1 single and ndc80Δ mad2Δ double mutants formed chains of cells that could not be separated by zymolyase treatment and were therefore defective in cytokinesis (Figure 2B). Thus, chromosome segregation was not required for proper completion of cytokinesis, and instead the cytokinesis failure correlated with midzone defects. Accordingly, microtubules were found to be required for cytokinesis. When synchronized in G1 with α factor and released into fresh medium containing nocodazole, mad2Δ cells progressed through the cell cycle, exited mitosis, and entered a new cycle, indicated by the formation of a second bud (Li and Murray, 1991Li R. Murray A.W. Feedback control of mitosis in budding yeast.Cell. 1991; 66: 519-531Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (910) Google Scholar; Figure 2C). These bibudded cells were not resolved by zymolyase (Figure 2D), indicating that they failed to complete cytokinesis. Our analysis of the kinetochore mutants nnf1-17 and mtw1-1 indicated that kinetochore microtubule interactions were not involved in this process. To test whether cytoplasmic microtubules were involved, we analyzed the division of the cnm67Δ cells. Cnm67 is a component of the outer plaque of the SPB that anchors cytoplasmic microtubules to the SPB. Cells lacking Cnm67 fail to properly position their spindle but exit mitosis on schedule, due to defective organization of the SPB and the spindle orientation checkpoint (Hoepfner et al., 2000Hoepfner D. Brachat A. Philippsen P. Time-lapse video microscopy analysis reveals astral microtubule detachment in the yeast spindle pole mutant cnm67.Mol. Biol. Cell. 2000; 11: 1197-1211Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). We found that cnm67Δ cells completed cytokinesis properly (Figures 2C–2E). In these cells, Slk19-GFP localized to the spindle midzone normally (Figure 2E). Thus, neither microtubule-kinetochore attachment nor cytoplasmic microtubules are required for cytokinesis. We concluded that the microtubules required for cytokinesis corresponded to those of the midzone. It is important to note that cytokinetic defects did not correlate with a failure in mitotic exit, since ndc10-1 and nocodazole-treated mad2Δ cells went on to rereplicate DNA, degrade Pds1 and Clb2, and accumulate Sic1 with kinetics similar to wild-type (Fraschini et al., 2001Fraschini R. Beretta A. Lucchini G. Piatti S. Role of the kinetochore protein Ndc10 in mitotic checkpoint activation in Saccharomyces cerevisiae.Mol. Genet. Genomics. 2001; 266: 115-125Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar; Figure 3C and data not shown). It is also noteworthy that cnm67Δ cells misposition the spindle midzone relative to the bud neck but complete cytokinesis normally. Therefore, the midzone position is irrelevant for yeast cytokinesis. Because Ase1-depleted cells delay abscission, we tested whether ndc10-1, ndc80-1 mad2Δ, and nocodazole-treated mad2Δ cells also suffer of abscission defects. Calcofluor staining showed that these cells failed to complete septation (Figure 3A). Moreover, time-lapse microscopy showed that the actomyosin ring contracted and disassembled with wild-type kinetics in ndc10-1 and nocodazole-treated mad2Δ cells (Figure 3B). Thus, in these cells, cytokinesis was impaired after actomyosin ring contraction. To investigate whether abscission failed, we monitored the plasma membrane at the bud neck. Cells containing Ras2-GFP were imaged in three dimensions by spinning disk confocal microscopy. In cnm67Δ and untreated mad2Δ mutant cells, the plasma membrane was continuous through the bud neck of mitotic cells. In postmitotic cells, two plasma membranes were observed that were clearly separated by the unlabeled septum (Figure 3D), indicating that these cells completed abscission. In contrast, the plasma membrane of the postmitotic mad2Δ cells treated with nocodazole had ingressed but was not resolved, indicating that abscission failed (Figure 3D). Consistent with this, ndc10-1 and nocodazole-treated mad2Δ cells displayed disorganized septin rings, a phenotype frequently observed in abscission mutants (Dobbelaere and Barral, 2004Dobbelaere J. Barral Y. Spatial coordination of cytokinetic events by compartmentalization of the cell cortex.Science. 2004; 305: 393-396Crossref PubMed Scopus (217) Google Scholar, Dobbelaere et al., 2003Dobbelaere J. Gentry M.S. Hallberg R.L. Barral Y. Phosphorylation-dependent regulation of septin dynamics during the cell cycle.Dev. Cell. 2003; 4: 345-357Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (196) Google Scholar; Figure 3E). By comparison, abscission-competent cnm67Δ cells showed septin rings indistinguishable from wild-type. Taken together, these results indicated that yeast cells with spindle-midzone defects display septin disorganization and delay or fail abscission. Two scenarios can account for the cytokinesis defect of midzone-defective cells. The spindle midzone might provide a positive signal necessary for abscission. Alternatively, active inhibition of abscission might delay cytokinesis as a secondary response to midzone defects. In the latter case, cells that are defective in inhibition should complete abscission even in the absence of a midzone. The yeast Aurora kinase Ipl1 and its associated protein Sli15/INCENP localize to the spindle midzone during anaphase and might be required for midzone stability (Pereira and Schiebel, 2003Pereira G. Schiebel E. Separase regulates INCENP-Aurora B anaphase spindle function through Cdc14.Science. 2003; 302: 2120-2124Crossref PubMed Scopus (214) Google Scholar). However, ipl1-321 mutants do not exhibit a cytokinesis defect (Figure 4A; Biggins and Murray, 2001Biggins S. Murray A.W. The budding yeast protein kinase Ipl1/Aurora allows the absence of tension to activate the spindle checkpoint.Genes Dev. 2001; 15: 3118-3129Crossref PubMed Scopus (320) Google Scholar, Buvelot et al., 2003Buvelot S. Tatsutani S.Y. Vermaak D. Biggins S. The budding yeast Ipl1/Aurora protein kinase regulates mitotic spindle disassembly.J. Cell Biol. 2003; 160: 329-339Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar). We therefore tested whether the cytokinesis defect in midzone mutants requires Ipl1 kinase activity and asked whether the ipl1-321 and sli15-1 mutations rescued cytokinesis in midzone-defective cells. As shown in Figure 4A, inactivation of Ipl1 or Sli15 did not prevent the formation of bibudded cells. However, all bibudded cells formed a septum at postmitotic necks (Figure 4B) and were efficiently separated by zymolyase (Figure 4A). Spindle-midzone defects were not rescued in these cells (Figure 4C), indicating that inactivation of Ipl1 and Sli15 directly restored abscission. Thus, the spindle midzone is not required per se for cytokinesis. Instead, midzone defects cause Aurora/Ipl1- and INCENP/Sli15-dependent inhibition of abscission. To elucidate how Ipl1 inhibits abscission, we investigated whether it translocates from the closed nucleus to the bud neck in response to midzone defects. In ndc10-1 cells, Ipl1-3GFP localized along the broken spindles (Figure 4D). In nocodazole-treated mad2Δ cells, no spindle assembled and Ipl1 localized to nuclear dots (data not shown). Ipl1 was never observed at the bud neck. Thus, we postulated that Ipl1 inhibits abscission through proteins that shuttle between the nucleus and the bud neck. Boi1 and Boi2 are highly related proteins involved in polarized growth. They are structurally related to anillins, a family of cytokinesis proteins characterized by the presence of a pleckstrin-homology (PH) domain at their C terminus and by the ability to shuttle between the nucleus and the cell cortex. Accordingly, Boi1 and Boi2 carry a PH domain at their C termini, localize to the bud cortex during bud emergence and to the bud neck during mitosis (Hallett et al., 2002Hallett M.A. Lo H.S. Bender A. Probing the importance and potential roles of the binding of the PH-domain protein Boi1 to acidic phospholipids.BMC Cell Biol. 2002; 3: 16Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). Furthermore, they are occasionally observed in the nucleus of G1 cells (E. Bailly, personal communication; Figure 5C). Finally, boi1Δ boi2Δ double-mutant cells separate normally (Figure 4A), indicating that they might not act positively in cytokinesis. Thus, we asked whether they acted as cytokinetic inhibitors. Therefore, we constructed the ndc10-1 boi1Δ boi2Δ triple mutant and analyzed its phenotype. Four hours after α factor release, 26% of the boi1Δ boi2Δ ndc10-1 triple mutant cells were bibudded (versus 36% in ndc10-1). Most of these cells formed proper septa (Figure 4B) and were resolved to unbudded and single-budded cells by zymolyase treatment (Figure 4A). Furthermore, as in the ndc10-1 ipl1-321 double mutants, midzone defects were not suppressed in these cells (Figure 4C). Thus, Boi1 and Boi2 functioned in the inhibition of abscission in midzone defective cells. We next carried out a detailed analysis of Boi1 and Boi2 localization. Coexpression of Boi1-GFP and CFP-Tub1 revealed that Boi1 translocated from the nucleus, where it was detected in a fraction of G1 cells, to the cortex of the emerging bud in G2 and to the bud neck of anaphase cells (Figures 5A, arrows, and 5B). After spindle breakdown, low levels of Boi1-GFP were briefly present on both sides of the neck (Figure 5A, arrowheads), and faded away prior to cell separation. Similar results were obtained for Boi2-GFP expressed from a multicopy plasmid, in which case the accumulation of Boi2-GFP to G1 nuclei was more obvious (Figure 5C). In contrast to wild-type cells, most ndc10-1 cells that failed abscission maintained Boi1 at the bud neck even after the emergence of a new bud (Figure 5A). Thus, the localization of Boi1 and Boi2 was consistent with a role in the inhibition of abscission. Remarkably, in the ipl1-321 mutant shifted to the restrictive temperature, Boi1-GFP failed to localize to the cortex of growing buds and to the bud neck of anaphase cells. Instead, it remained nuclear for the whole cell cycle (Figure 5B). Similar results were obtained for plasmid borne Boi2-GFP (Figure 5C). Thus, Ipl1 activity was required for the proper localization of Boi1 and Boi2, establishing that Boi1 and Boi2 act downstream of Ipl1. Boi1 and Boi2 contain several Ipl1 consensus phosphorylation sites. However, simultaneous mutation of all sites in both Boi1 and Boi2 did not alter their localization (data not shown). Thus, some other Ipl1 substrate might function in the control of Boi1 and Boi2 localization. Alternatively, additional Ipl1 sites might exist on these proteins. To test whether Boi1/Boi2 are required to regulate abscission in all cells or only in cells with midzone defects, we analyzed the progression of cytokinesis in wild-type and boi1Δ boi2Δ double mutant cells using time-lapse microscopy. As in Figure 1A, we monitored mitotic progression and abscission using the reporters Spc42-CFP and Ras2-GFP. In all movies, the bud neck membrane contracted shortly after spindle breakdown, visualized by the sudden decrease in SPB-to-SPB distance (Figure 6A; t = 25 min; upper graph in Figure 6B; wild-type = 1.6 ± 1.2 min after spindle breakdown; boi1Δ boi2Δ = 1.3 ± 1.1 min; n = 13 and 9, respectively). In wild-type cells, the membrane remained “pinched” for an average of 15 min (±1.05 min; n = 13) before being resolved by abscission (Figure 6A; t = 43 min). Remarkably, the interval between membrane contraction and resolution was significantly reduced in the boi1Δ boi2Δ double-mutant cells (11.9 ± 0.9 min; n = 9; p < 0.05). Anaphase proceeded normally in these cells (Figure 6B). Thus, abscission was advanced in the boi1Δ boi2Δ double mutant as compared to wild-type, demonstrating that Boi1 and Boi2 control the timing of abscission in wild-type cells. Consistent with our original observation (Figure 1B), time-lapse analysis showed that membrane resolution in ase1Δ mutant cells occurs approximately 24 min after contraction, 9 min later than wild-type (Figures 6B and 6C; mean ase1Δ = 24.2 ± 2.3 min; n = 10; p < 0.005). Similar results were obtained with the GALS:HA-ASE1 cells grown in glucose (22.2 ± 2.3 min; n = 11; p < 0.05). This delay depended on Boi1 and Boi2, since the boi1Δ boi2Δ GALS:HA-ASE1 triple mutant completed cytokinesis with wild-type kinetics (15.2 ± 1.3 min; n = 10). In these cells, spindle dynamics were identical to that of the GALS:HA-ASE1 and ase1Δ cells, indicating that the midzone defect was not suppressed (Figure 6B). The timing of cytokinesis could not be determined for the boi1Δ boi2Δ ase1Δ triple-mutant cells because this strain was not viable. Micromanipulation of boi1Δ boi2Δ ase1Δ spores indicated that they germinated properly and underwent a few rounds of division, completing cytokinesis and cell separation before arrest (data not shown). Together, these data establish that Boi1 and Boi2 delay abscission and are required for cell viability in response to spindle-midzone defects. Together, our data indicate that spindle-midzone defects lead to Ipl1- and Boi1/Boi2-dependent inhibition of abscission. We next wondered about the biological function of this inhibition. Central spindle collapse during anaphase delays the clearance of the cleavage plane from chromatin. Indeed, upon shift to the repressive condition, chromosome segregation was strongly impaired in GALS:HA-ASE1 cells, as assayed by DAPI staining (Fig"

However, by appending pi-electron-donating amino groups to the triangular skeleton, we prepared a cyclopropenylidene derivative that is stable at room temperature. In contrast to previously isolated carbenes, this compound does not require a heteroatom adjacent to the electron-deficient carbon to confer stability. Despite the presence of amino groups, the geometric parameters of the cyclic skeleton, revealed by x-ray crystallography, are only slightly perturbed relative to those of the calculated structure of unsubstituted cyclopropenylidene. Stable cyclopropenylidene derivatives might thus serve as models for a better understanding of the formation of carbon-bearing molecules in the interstellar medium."

Currently, the picture regarding assembly of ESCRTs on endosomes is incomplete. The structure of the conserved heterotrimeric ESCRT-I core presented here shows a fan-like arrangement of three helical hairpins, each corresponding to a different subunit. Vps23/Tsg101 is the central hairpin sandwiched between the other subunits, explaining the critical role of its “steadiness box” in the stability of ESCRT-I. We show that yeast ESCRT-I links directly to ESCRT-II, through a tight interaction of Vps28 (ESCRT-I) with the yeast-specific zinc-finger insertion within the GLUE domain of Vps36 (ESCRT-II). The crystal structure of the GLUE domain missing this insertion reveals it is a split PH domain, with a noncanonical lipid binding pocket that binds PtdIns3P. The simultaneous and reinforcing interactions of ESCRT-II GLUE domain with membranes, ESCRT-I, and ubiquitin are critical for ubiquitinated cargo progression from early to late endosomes."
https://openalex.org/W2017479299,"The intricate system of serum complement proteins provides resistance to infection. A pivotal step in the complement pathway is the assembly of a C3 convertase, which digests the C3 complement component to form microbial binding C3 fragments recognized by leukocytes. The spleen and C3 provide resistance against blood-borne S. pneumoniae infection. To better understand the mechanisms involved, we studied SIGN-R1, a lectin that captures microbial polysaccharides in spleen. Surprisingly, conditional SIGN-R1 knockout mice developed deficits in C3 catabolism when given S. pneumoniae or its capsular polysaccharide intravenously. There were marked reductions in proteolysis of serum C3, deposition of C3 on organisms within SIGN-R1+ spleen macrophages, and formation of C3 ligands. We found that SIGN-R1 directly bound the complement C1 subcomponent, C1q, and assembled a C3 convertase, but without the traditional requirement for either antibody or factor B.

The intricate but elegant system of complement proteins is responsible for several innate and adaptive resistance mechanisms. A pivotal step is the formation of a C3 convertase, which catalyzes the proteolysis of complement component, C3. The C3 convertase is formed by (1) a “classical” pathway initiated by the binding of C1q to immunoglobulin (Ig) in immune complexes, (2) an “alternative” pathway triggered directly by certain microbial cell walls and catalyzed by factor B, and (3) a soluble mannose binding lectin pathway with many homologies to the classical C1q based pathway (reviewed in Fearon and Wong, 1983Fearon D.T.

Immunol. 2002; 2: 346-353Crossref PubMed Scopus (531) Google Scholar). The C3 convertase first generates C3b that is further processed to C3bi and C3d. C3b, C3bi, and C3d serve as ligands or “opsonins” for cellular receptors on B cells, phagocytes, and follicular dendritic cells (FDCs). Receptor-mediated binding of these C3 opsonins leads to microbial clearance by phagocytes (Fearon and Wong, 1983Fearon D.T. Wong W.W. Complement ligand-receptor interactions that mediate biological responses.Annu. Rev. Immunol. 1983; 1: 243-271Crossref PubMed Scopus (190) Google Scholar), stimulation of B cells (Carroll, 1998Carroll M.C. The role of complement and complement receptors in induction and regulation of immunity.Annu. Rev.

Impaired antibody response to group B streptococcal type III capsular polysaccharide in C3- and complement receptor 2-deficient mice.J. Immunol. 2003; 170: 84-90PubMed Google Scholar). C3 processing also releases the C3a peptide, which is an anaphylatoxin that causes smooth muscle contraction, mast cell histamine release, and local inflammation. Additionally, a lytic membrane attack complex of other complement components C5b, 6, 7, 8 is assembled on cellular targets. Therefore the complement system is a major pathway for resistance and pathology, and the formation of a C3 convertase is pivotal. The spleen clears microorganisms from the blood stream, with Streptococcus pneumoniae representing a major example (Amlot and Hayes, 1985Amlot P.L. Hayes A.E.

J. 2002; 21: 278-282Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). Despite the development of effective treatments, this gram-positive coccus has remained a significant cause of morbidity and mortality (Garau, 2002Garau J. Treatment of drug-resistant pneumococcal pneumonia.Lancet Infect. Dis. 2002; 2: 404-415Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar), being one of the most common causes of bacterial pneumonia, otitis media, meningitis, and septicemia (Musher, 1992Musher D.M.

Opsonin-dependent phagocytosis via complement plays an important role in host defense against pneumococci (Brown et al., 1982Brown E.J. Hosea S.W. Hammer C.H. Burch C.G. Frank M.M.

Patients with deficiencies of early components of the classical pathway of complement and C3 are at high risk for pneumococcal disease (Picard et al., 2003Picard C. Puel A. Bustamante J. Ku C.L.

In contrast, the soluble mannose binding lectin binds poorly to S. pneumoniae (Neth et al., 2000Neth O. Jack D.L. Dodds A.W. Holzel H. Klein N.J. Turner M.W.

Knockout mice have revealed that C3 and C4 are dominantly required for innate resistance to S. pneumoniae, but surprisingly, there is only a small or partial need for the traditional mediators of C3 fixation like factor B, mannose binding lectin, and immunoglobulin (Ig) (Brown et al., 2002Brown J.S.

Together, these findings indicate that there is likely to be an unusual complement fixation pathway that is independent of factor B, Ig, and mannose binding lectin but that nevertheless forms C3 opsonins for resistance to pneumococci by phagocytes and B cells. The spleen contains specialized regions called marginal zones (MZ), which lie at the junction of each white pulp nodule with the red pulp (Mebius and Kraal, 2005Mebius R.E. Kraal G. Structure and function of the spleen.Nat. Rev. Immunol. 2005; 5: 606-616Crossref PubMed Scopus (1267) Google Scholar). The MZ contains unique MZ B cells (Martin and Kearney, 2002Martin F. Kearney J.F. Marginal-zone B cells.Nat. Rev. Immunol. 2002; 2: 323-335Crossref PubMed Scopus (651) Google Scholar) enmeshed with MZ macrophages in a reticular cell network (Kraal and Janse, 1986Kraal G. Janse M. Marginal metallophilic cells of the mouse spleen identified by a monoclonal antibody.Immunology. 1986; 58: 665-669PubMed Google Scholar). In the MZ, there is a strongly reduced blood flow allowing intimate contact between antigens and effector cells (Guinamard et al., 2000Guinamard R. Okigaki M. Schlessinger J. Ravetch J.V. Absence of marginal zone B cells in Pyk-2-deficient mice defines their role in the humoral response.Nat. Immunol. 2000; 1: 31-36Crossref PubMed Scopus (426) Google Scholar).

SIGN-R1 is the principal receptor for bacterial dextrans as well as the capsular pneumococcal polysaccharide (CPS) of S. pneumoniae, so that deletion of SIGN-R1 ablates clearance of these polysaccharides by MZ macrophages (Geijtenbeek et al., 2002Geijtenbeek T.B.H.

Our approach to conditional deletion of SIGN-R1 involves administration of the monoclonal antibody 22D1. Treatment with this mAb selectively ablates SIGN-R1 expression, but not MZ macrophages, as monitored with a combination of antibodies to a distinct epitope to SIGN-R1 and other MZ receptors (Kang et al., 2004Kang Y.S. Kim J.Y. Bruening S.A. Pack M. Charalambous A. Pritsker A. Moran T.M. Loeffler J.M. Steinman R.M. Park C.G.

USA. 2004; 101: 215-220Crossref PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar). Furthermore, Lanoue et al. used genetic deletion of SIGN-R1 to demonstrate the contribution of this lectin to protection of mice against pneumococcal septicemia (Lanoue et al., 2004Lanoue A. Clatworthy M.R. Smith P. Green S. Townsend M.J. Jolin H.E. Smith K.G. Fallon P.G. McKenzie A.N. SIGN-R1 contributes to protection against lethal pneumococcal infection in mice.J. Exp. Med. 2004; 200: 1383-1393Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar). In our continuing studies of 22D1 anti-SIGN-R1-treated mice, we found surprisingly that, in addition to a lack of CPS and dextran uptake in SIGN-R1+ MZ macrophages, the polysaccharides were no longer deposited on SIGN-R1− spleen FDCs. This suggested a link between SIGN-R1 and the formation of C3 opsonins for FDCs. We will show that this membrane bound lectin initiates a classical but Ig-independent pathway for C3 fixation by binding C1q and depositing C3 on bound polysaccharides and S. pneumoniae. We suggest that this new pathway for C3 fixation by SIGN-R1 bound polysaccharides contributes to the role of the spleen in resistance to certain encapsulated organisms. To study the previously defined interaction of capsular pneumococcal polysaccharide (CPS) with the SIGN-R1 lectin on marginal zone (MZ) macrophages of spleen (Kang et al., 2004Kang Y.S. Kim J.Y. Bruening S.A. Pack M. Charalambous A. Pritsker A. Moran T.M. Loeffler J.M. Steinman R.M. Park C.G.

USA. 2004; 101: 215-220Crossref PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar), we injected mice with 100 μg of CPS14 i.v. and localized it with anti-CPS14 antibody in sections of spleen 10 min to 1 hr later. Within minutes, the CPS localized to SIGN-R1+ MZ macrophages, which were identified with anti-SIGN-R1 antibodies (Kang et al., 2003Kang Y.-S. Yamazaki S. Iyoda T. Pack M. Bruening S. Kim J.Y. Takahara K. Inaba K. Steinman R.M. Park C.G. SIGN-R1, a novel C-type lectin expressed by marginal zone macrophages in spleen, mediates uptake of the polysaccharide dextran.Int.

Park C.G. The C-type lectin SIGN-R1 mediates uptake of the capsular polysaccharide of Streptococcus pneumoniae in the marginal zone of mouse spleen.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2004; 101: 215-220Crossref PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar). However, by 1 hr the CPS was also found in the B cell areas or follicles of the white pulp (Figure 1A, white arrows). The follicle-associated CPS colocalized to follicular dendritic cells (FDCs), which are known to express CD21/CD35 complement receptors but not SIGN-R1 (Figure 1B, yellow staining). In SIGN-R1-transient knockout mice generated by mAb 22D1 treatment (Kang et al., 2004Kang Y.S. Kim J.Y. Bruening S.A. Pack M. Charalambous A. Pritsker A. Moran T.M. Loeffler J.M. Steinman R.M. Park C.G. The C-type lectin SIGN-R1 mediates uptake of the capsular polysaccharide of Streptococcus pneumoniae in the marginal zone of mouse spleen.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2004; 101: 215-220Crossref PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar), CPS14 was not taken up by MZ macrophages as expected, but in addition the CPS did not localize to follicles (Figure 1A) or FDCs (Figure 1B). This surprising finding suggested that SIGN-R1 on MZ macrophages is needed for the deposition of CPS14 on SIGN-R1− FDCs. Since prior results (Harms et al., 1996Harms G. Hardonk M.J. Timens W. In vitro complement-dependent binding and in vivo kinetics of pneumococcal polysaccharide TI-2 antigens in the rat spleen marginal zone and follicle.Infect. Immun. 1996; 64: 4220-4225Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) showed that CPS binding to the MZ and FDCs was dependent on complement, probably a C3 fragment, we compared C3−/− and wild-type mice. We found that CPS14 was taken up by SIGN-R1+ MZ macrophages in wild-type and C3−/− mice (Figure 1C). However, CPS14 did not bind to FDCs in C3−/− mice (Figure 1C). Thus SIGN-R1 and C3 are somehow both needed for CPS binding to FDCs, suggesting that this lectin might contribute to C3 fixation. To pursue the suggestion that SIGN-R1 was required for the formation of C3 ligands, we injected CPS or mitomycin-C treated (growth inactivated) S. pneumoniae into control and 22D1-treated mice (controls included mice given hamster Ig, N418 anti-CD11c, and anti-Marco, a scavenger receptor on MZ macrophages). Over the ensuing hour, we monitored C3 processing in blood by immunoblotting serum samples with polyclonal anti-C3 antibody. This antibody reacts with the two components of native C3, αC3, and βC3 as well as the fragments of αC3 that are generated during C3 processing by C3 convertases (Figure 2A shows information for human C3) (Law and Dodds, 1997Law S.K. Dodds A.W. The internal thioester and the covalent binding properties of the complement proteins C3 and C4.Protein Sci. 1997; 6: 263-274Crossref PubMed Scopus (275) Google Scholar). In the steady state, C3 convertase is active so that two C3 fragments (iC3b; 70 kDa and 43 kDa) are always evident in serum. However, when pneumococci or CPS were given i.v., there was rapid processing of αC3 (but not βC3, which serves as a loading control for the immunoblotting), such that the serum sample lost most of the detectable αC3 as well as the 70 kDa iC3b but accumulated the 43 kDa iC3b (see the two left lanes of Figures 2B and 2C). These data in vivo are consistent with previous results in vitro (Campbell et al., 1991Campbell J.R. Baker C.J. Edwards M.S. Deposition and degradation of C3 on type III group B streptococci.Infect. Immun. 1991; 59: 1978-1983Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Pneumococci, but not several other bacteria that we tested, rapidly activated C3 in vivo (Figure S1). The processing of C3 was more active with CPS from type 14 S. pneumoniae than CPS23 and CPS26 (data not shown), and it is known that CPS14 binds with higher affinity to SIGN-R1 relative to CPS23 and CPS26 (Kang et al., 2004Kang Y.S. Kim J.Y. Bruening S.A. Pack M. Charalambous A. Pritsker A. Moran T.M. Loeffler J.M. Steinman R.M. Park C.G. The C-type lectin SIGN-R1 mediates uptake of the capsular polysaccharide of Streptococcus pneumoniae in the marginal zone of mouse spleen.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2004; 101: 215-220Crossref PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar). Importantly, the activation of C3 in response to bacteria (Figure 2B) or CPS (Figure 2C) was blocked in 22D1-treated mice, indicating that SIGN-R1 is in large part responsible for rapid C3 convertase formation induced by S. pneumoniae in mice. These results were unexpected because in vitro, C3 can be activated via the alternative pathway when S. pneumoniae (but not CPS) is added to serum (Winkelstein and Tomasz, 1977Winkelstein J.A. Tomasz A. Activation of the alternative pathway by pneumococcal cell walls.J. Immunol. 1977; 118: 451-454PubMed Google Scholar), as we confirmed (Figure 2D, left; data for CPS not shown). We also verified that C3 processing in vitro in response to bacteria occurred similarly when we compared serum from wild-type mice or from mice treated with hamster Ig or 22D1 anti-SIGN-R1 mAb 24 hr earlier (Figure 2D). In other words, 22D1 treatment was not consuming C3 and not preventing direct fixation of C3 from serum by S. pneumoniae. However, the kinetics of C3 processing was much more rapid when S. pneumoniae was administered in vivo, being detectable within 5 min (Figure 2E), as opposed to adding organisms to serum in vitro, where 30 min were required for significant C3 catabolism (Figure 2D). Thus CPS and S. pneumoniae are both captured within minutes from the blood by SIGN-R1+ MZ macrophages, and the latter dominate the early processing of C3 in vivo. We next wanted to verify a role for SIGN-R1 during C3 fixation by S. pneumoniae directly in spleen sections in vivo. We injected i.v. 108 CFU (colony-forming units), mitomycin C-treated type 14 (Pn14) organisms that were also labeled with carboxyfluorescein diacetate succinimidyl ester (CFSE). 90 min later, to allow for uptake by MZ macrophages and deposition of CPS on FDCs, the spleens were sectioned and examined by deconvolution microscopy. The Pn14 were taken up in the MZ in control and C3 deficient (C3−/−) mice, but there were diminished numbers of organisms in the MZ of mice treated beforehand with anti-SIGN-R1 mAb 22D1, possibly because there were residual SIGN-R1 molecules and/or receptors for the organisms in addition to SIGN-R1 (Figure 3A). C3 was deposited on the organisms in control mice in the MZ when mice were given pneumococci but not in C3−/− mice, as expected (Figure 3A, yellow labeling). In 22D1 treated mice, when we selected regions of the MZ where there was some uptake of CFSE-labeled S. pneumoniae, C3 was minimally fixed to the individual organisms (Figure 3A). C3 likewise was clearly deposited on CD21/35+ FDCs in control mice given the CFSE labeled organisms, very little in the 22D1 treated animals, and not at all in C3−/− mice (Figure 3B). Likewise, when we injected either CPS (or dextran, data not shown) i.v. in control mice, the polysaccharides were taken up in MZ macrophages and C3 was deposited there, but again not in 22D1 treated animals (Supplemental Figure S2). Therefore when pneumococci or polysaccharides are injected i.v., SIGN-R1 dominates the fixation of C3 to MZ macrophages and subsequently, FDCs. Because we were using treatment with mAb 22D1 to selectively deplete SIGN-R1, we needed to verify that this approach was relevant to the resistance of mice to infection with S. pneumoniae, as described by Lanoue et al., who showed that genetic deletion of SIGN-R1 decreased innate resistance (Lanoue et al., 2004Lanoue A. Clatworthy M.R. Smith P. Green S. Townsend M.J. Jolin H.E. Smith K.G. Fallon P.G. McKenzie A.N. SIGN-R1 contributes to protection against lethal pneumococcal infection in mice.J. Exp. Med. 2004; 200: 1383-1393Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar). First, we repeated the experiments of J.S. Brown et al. (Brown et al., 2002Brown J.S. Hussell T. Gilliland S.M. Holden D.W. Paton J.C. Ehrenstein M.R. Walport M.J. Botto M. The classical pathway is the dominant complement pathway required for innate immunity to Streptococcus pneumoniae infection in mice.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2002; 99: 16969-16974Crossref PubMed Scopus (276) Google Scholar) on the heightened susceptibility of C3−/− mice, as well as mice treated with cobra venom factor (CVF) to deplete C3 (Figure 3C). C4−/− mice were also very susceptible to infection, although somewhat less than the C3 deficient mice (Figure 3C), again confirming prior results that a classical C4 dependent pathway is the dominant pathway for C3 fixation during innate resistance (Brown et al., 2002Brown J.S. Hussell T. Gilliland S.M. Holden D.W. Paton J.C. Ehrenstein M.R. Walport M.J. Botto M. The classical pathway is the dominant complement pathway required for innate immunity to Streptococcus pneumoniae infection in mice.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2002; 99: 16969-16974Crossref PubMed Scopus (276) Google Scholar). Splenectomized mice were likewise very sensitive to i.v. infection (Figure S3). 22D1 treated mice also showed a decrease in resistance to live S. pneumoniae in BALB/c and C57BL/6 strains (Figures 3D,E), comparable to genetic knockouts, but this pathway is only one of several that contribute to C3 fixation. For example, other contributions arise from the alternative pathway in serum (Figure 2D) (Brown et al., 2002Brown J.S. Hussell T. Gilliland S.M. Holden D.W. Paton J.C. Ehrenstein M.R. Walport M.J. Botto M. The classical pathway is the dominant complement pathway required for innate immunity to Streptococcus pneumoniae infection in mice.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2002; 99: 16969-16974Crossref PubMed Scopus (276) Google Scholar), natural antibody (Koppel et al., 2005Koppel E.A. Wieland C.W. van den Berg V.C. Litjens M. Florquin S. van Kooyk Y. van der Poll T. Geijtenbeek T.B. Specific ICAM-3 grabbing nonintegrin-related 1 (SIGNR1) expressed by marginal zone macrophages is essential for defense against pulmonary Streptococcus pneumoniae infection.Eur. J. Immunol. 2005; 35: 2962-2969Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar), and perhaps other lectins in the SIGN-R family such as the related SIGN-R3 lectin (Takahara et al., 2004Takahara K. Yashima Y. Omatsu Y. Yoshida H. Kimura Y. Kang Y.S. Steinman R.M. Park C.G. Inaba K. Functional comparison of the mouse DC-SIGN, SIGNR1, SIGNR3 and Langerin, C-type lectins.Int. Immunol. 2004; 16: 819-829Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar). Thus SIGN-R1 is one pathway for resistance to S. pneumoniae, most likely contributing to the early phase of C3 fixation (Figure 2B,E). To understand the linkage between SIGN-R1 and C3 processing, we searched for SIGN-R1 binding proteins in the spleen. We biotinylated the soluble extracellular domain of SIGN-R1, which was expressed by CHO cells, to allow for binding to streptavidin beads for 2 hr at 4°C. Binding was verified by the reactivity of the SIGN-R1-coated beads with mAb 22D1. We then added 10 mg of spleen or lymph node extracts to the SIGN-R1 coated beads, or beads coated with transferrin as control, for 12 hr at 4°C. The bound proteins were eluted and separated on a 4%–15% gradient SDS page gel and developed with silver staining. Since the transmembrane lectin SIGN-R1 is a mannose binding lectin (Galustian et al., 2004Galustian C. Park C.G. Chai W. Kiso M. Bruening S.A. Kang Y.S. Steinman R.M. Feizi T.

Immunol. 2004; 16: 853-866Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar), we expected SIGN-R1 to retrieve proteases called MASPs, which are soluble, mannose lectin-associated, serine proteases (Fujita, 2002Fujita T. Evolution of the lectin-complement pathway and its role in innate immunity.Nat. Rev. Immunol. 2002; 2: 346-353Crossref PubMed Scopus (531) Google Scholar). Instead, the 30 kDa band that was selectively bound to SIGN-R1-coated beads was repeatedly isolated and identified"

https://openalex.org/W2101600846,"Protein dynamics plays an important role in protein function. Many functionally important motions occur on the microsecond and low millisecond time scale and can be characterized by nuclear magnetic resonance relaxation experiments. We describe the different states of a peptidyl carrier protein (PCP) that play a crucial role in its function as a peptide shuttle in the nonribosomal peptide synthetases of the tyrocidine A system. Both apo-PCP (without the bound 4′-phosphopantetheine cofactor) and holo-PCP exist in two different stable conformations. We show that one of the apo conformations and one of the holo conformations are identical, whereas the two remaining conformations are only detectable by nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy in either the apo or holo form. We further demonstrate that this conformational diversity is an essential prerequisite for the directed movement of the 4′-PP cofactor and its interaction with externally acting proteins such as thioesterases and 4′-PP transferase."
https://openalex.org/W2007897629,"The ompF and ompC genes of Escherichia coli are reciprocally regulated by a single transcription factor, phosphorylated OmpR (OmpR-P), depending upon medium osmolarity.

We propose that this tight hierarchical binding of a transcription factor, OmpR, allows distinct stepwise regulation of ompF and ompC transcription, which minimizes their overlapping expression upon changes in the medium osmolarity to achieve the reciprocal expression of ompF and ompC. Escherichia coli contains two outer membrane porin proteins, OmpF and OmpC, which serve as passive diffusion pores across the outer membrane. Expression of these two proteins is reciprocally regulated by medium osmolarity. OmpF is preferentially produced at low osmolarity, whereas OmpC is almost exclusively produced at high osmolarity. Because OmpF forms a larger pore than OmpC (1Nikaido H. Rosenberg E.Y. J. Bacteriol. 1983; 153: 241-252Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), the regulation of the size of the passive diffusion pores across the outer membrane appears to be vital for E. coli, which is able to live in two distinctly different environmental conditions: one under nutrient-rich high osmolarity conditions in animal gut at 37 °C and the other under poor nutritional and low osmolarity conditions outside animals and thus at low osmolarity at ambient temperatures. It has been proposed that the larger OmpF pore size is important for efficient nutrient uptake from nutritionally poor media, whereas the smaller OmpC pore size is important to exclude the passage of toxic bile salt across the outer membrane (2Ferrario M. Ernsting B.R. Borst D.W. Wiese D.E. II Blumenthal Matthews R. M.R.G. J. Bacteriol. 1995; 177: 103-113Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). E. coli has a highly sophisticated regulatory system to regulate the reciprocal expression of ompF and ompC. Both are controlled at the transcriptional level by the histidine kinase EnvZ, a transmembrane osmosensor, and the response regulator OmpR, a transcriptional factor (3Hall M.N. Silhavy T.J. J. Mol. Biol. 1981; 151: 1-15Crossref PubMed Scopus (161) Google Scholar), and also at the translational level by antisense RNAs, micF RNA for ompF mRNA (4Mizuno T. Chou M.Y. Inouye M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1984; 81: 1966-1970Crossref PubMed Scopus (446) Google Scholar) and micC RNA for ompC mRNA (5Chen S. Zhang A. Blyn L.B. Storz G. J. Bacteriol. 2004; 186: 6689-6697Crossref PubMed Scopus (192) Google Scholar). The EnvZ-OmpR system is a typical two-component His-Asp phosphorelay signal transduction system in E. coli (see review in Ref. 6Inouye M. Dutta R. Zhu Y. Histidine Kinases in Signal Transduction. 2003; (Academic Press, Inc., San Diego, CA): 25-45Crossref Scopus (14) Google Scholar). Because EnvZ not only has kinase activity to phosphorylate OmpR but also phosphatase activity toward phosphorylated OmpR (OmpR-P), it is able to regulate the level of OmpR-P in the cell depending upon the medium osmolarity. At low medium osmolarity, the phosphatase activity is relatively higher than the kinase activity so that the cellular concentration of OmpR-P is maintained at a lower concentration, which is sufficient to activate expression of ompF but not of ompC. At high medium osmolarity, the EnvZ phosphatase activity becomes relatively lower than its kinase activity, resulting in higher cellular concentration of OmpR-P. Under this condition, ompF expression is repressed, whereas ompC expression is activated. In our recent study on the interaction between the cytoplasmic domain of EnvZ (EnvZc) and OmpR or OmpR-P (7Yoshida T. Cai S. Inouye M. Mol. Microbiol. 2002; 46: 1283-1294Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar), we proposed that the reciprocal expression of ompF and ompC occurs through a finely tuned mechanism. In this model, osmotic signals regulate the levels of OmpR-P by modulating the ratio of kinase to phosphatase activity of EnvZ. Most importantly, of the large pool of OmpR (3,500 molecules/cell), only a very small portion is proposed to be phosphorylated (8Cai S.J. Inouye M. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 24155-24161Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (217) Google Scholar). On the other hand, the Kd value for OmpR-P binding to the regulatory regions of the ompF and ompC promoters (9Bergstrom L.C. Qin L. Harlocker S.L. Egger L.A. Inouye M. Genes Cells. 1998; 3: 777-788Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar, 10Head C.G. Tardy A. Kenney L.J. J. Mol. Biol. 1998; 281: 857-870Crossref PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar) is less than 1% of the total cellular concentration of OmpR and OmpR-P. This was proposed to be a critical factor in the reciprocal expression of ompF and ompC. For example, even with a minor change in the ratio of the kinase to phosphatase activity of EnvZ, the resulting small shift in the cellular concentration of OmpR-P would be sufficient to substantially change the number of OmpR-P molecules bound to the regulatory regions of the ompF and ompC promoters. There is approximately a few hundred-fold difference between the Kd value for OmpR-P binding to the regulatory regions of the ompF and ompC promoters versus the total cellular concentration of OmpR and OmpR-P (7Yoshida T. Cai S. Inouye M. Mol. Microbiol. 2002; 46: 1283-1294Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). There are four F sites (F1, F2, F3, and F4) and three C sites (C1, C2, and C3) in the upstream region of the ompF and ompC promoters, respectively. Each site consists of 20 base pairs, providing a tandem binding site for two OmpR-P molecules (11Harlocker S.L. Bergstrom L. Inouye M. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 26849-26856Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar, 12Harrison-McMonagle P. Denissova N. Martinez-Hackert E. Ebright R.H. Stock A.M. J. Mol. Biol. 1999; 285: 555-566Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). The hierarchy of OmpR-P binding to these F and C sites was determined to be F1, C1 > F2, F3 > C2 > C3 (9Bergstrom L.C. Qin L. Harlocker S.L. Egger L.A. Inouye M. Genes Cells. 1998; 3: 777-788Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). At low osmolarity, OmpR-P cooperatively binds to F1-F2/F1-F2-F3 to activate ompF transcription. Under this condition, only the C1 site is occupied by OmpR-P, which is not sufficient to activate ompC transcription. Only when the OmpR-P concentration elevates in response to increased medium osmolarity do the C2 and C3 sites become occupied by OmpR-P, resulting in ompC expression. Under this condition, OmpR-P also binds to the F4 site (–380 to –361), a weak OmpR-P-binding site located 260-bp upstream of the F1 site (–100 to –81). OmpR-P binding to the F4 site is proposed to form a loop that interacts with OmpR-P molecules binding to F1, F2, and F3, thereby blocking ompF transcription (9Bergstrom L.C. Qin L. Harlocker S.L.

Bacteriol. 1994; 176: 1309-1315Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 14Rampersaud A. Harlocker S.L. Inouye M. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 12559-12566Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Here, we investigated how two OmpR-P molecules cooperatively bind to F1, F2, and F3 as well as C1, C2, and C3. The 20-bp F1 site is composed of two 10-bp subsites, F1a and F1b (from 5′ to 3′). We found that the affinity of OmpR-P for the upstream F1a is much weaker than that for the downstream F1b, suggesting binding to the F1 site is initiated by OmpR-P interaction with the F1b subsite. Similarly, OmpR-P had a higher affinity for the downstream subsites, F2b and F3b for F2 and F3 sites, respectively, than their cognate upstream subsites, F2a and F3a. Therefore, OmpR-P binding to F1-F2-F3 occurs discontinuously in a stepwise manner in the order F1b to F1a, F2b to F2a, and F3b to F3a. Similarly, OmpR-P binds to C1-C2-C3 in this discontinuous manner. We termed this novel mode of OmpR-P binding to the regulatory regions as the “galloping model.” This mechanism is inherent to the distinct reciprocal expression of ompF and ompC minimizes their overlapping expression under a given condition. Because OmpR belongs to the largest response regulator family (OmpR/PhoB) in E. coli, the DNA binding of transcription factors in galloping mode may be widely found in E. coli. Oligonucleotides—The OmpR-binding sites of F (F1, F1-F2, and F1-F2-F3), C (C1, C1-C2, and C1-C2-C3) and various mutated sequences were synthesized by Integrated DNA Technologies, Inc. Complimentary strands were first annealed, and double-stranded DNA was purified for DNA gel mobility shift assay. DNA concentration was determined by UV absorbance at 260 nm. Purification of Proteins—EnvZc[T247R] previously termed EnvZc11, OmpR, and PrS2-OmpR were purified as described previously (11Harlocker S.L. Bergstrom L. Inouye M. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 26849-26856Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar, 15Dutta R. Yoshida T. Inouye M. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 38645-38653Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). The C-terminal domain of OmpR (OmpRc) was purified as described previously (16Martinez-Hackert E. Stock A.M. Structure. 1997; 5: 109-124Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (205) Google Scholar). DNA Gel Mobility Shift Assay—Each purified 20 pmol of double-stranded DNA was labeled by using T4 kinase and [γ-32P]ATP (3000 Ci/mmol and 10 mCi/ml) for 1 h at 37 °C. Free [γ-32P]ATP was removed by phenol/chloroform extraction followed by ethanol precipitation. After air drying, labeled DNA was resuspended in 100 μl of water containing 70 pmol of unlabeled double-stranded DNA. The binding reactions were carried out in 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.2) buffer containing 50 mm KCl, 5 mm CaCl2, 5% glycerol, 0.05% Nonidet P-40, and 100 ng of poly(dI-dC) at room temperature. First, EnvZc11 was phosphorylated using 1 mm ATP for 5 min. EnvZc11 mixture was transferred to the tube containing different amounts of OmpR or PrS2-OmpR, and the reaction mixture was further incubated for 20 min to generate phosphorylated OmpR or PrS2-OmpR. Under this condition, 100% of OmpR or PrS2-OmpR was phosphorylated as judged from C4 reverse phase high pressure liquid chromatography. Fifteen μl of the reaction mixture was mixed with 1.5 μl of labeled DNA (∼45 fmol/μl) and incubated for 30 min (final volume, 16.5 μl). After the prerun for 1 h, the samples were subjected to 5% acrylamide/bisacrylamide (40:1.2) gel. The gel was run at 4 °C in TE buffer (10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.2, 1 mm EDTA) at 110 V, and every 30 min the buffer in the upper chamber and the buffer in the bottom chamber were exchanged. The dried gel was exposed for autoradiography and analyzed by phosphorimaging. The concentration of OmpR-P required for 50% binding to DNA is presented as the C50 value. DNase I Footprinting—Each purified 30-pmol sense oligonucleotide was labeled at 5′-end by using T4 kinase and [γ-32P]ATP (3000 Ci/mmol and 10 mCi/ml) for 1 h at 37 °C. Free [γ-32P]ATP was removed by phenol/chloroform extraction followed by ethanol precipitation. Labeled oligonucleotide was annealed by mixing its complementary sequence (40 pmol) in 50 μl of the annealing buffer (25 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, and 400 mm NaCl). The DNA binding reaction was carried out as described in DNA gel mobility shift assay by mixing OmpR or OmpRc with 1 μl of labeled DNA (∼600 fmol/μl); however, 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.0) buffer containing 50 mm KCl, 10 mm MgCl2, and 1 mm ATP, was used. Partial DNase I digestion was carried out at room temperature by adding 1 μl of 0.2 unit/μl DNase I (Promega) into the reaction mixture (final reaction volume, 10 μl). After 1-min incubation, the reaction was stopped by adding 1 μl of 200 mm EDTA, followed by incubating in the boiling water bath for 4 min. 6 μl of the loading buffer (95% formamide, 20 mm EDTA, 0.05% bromphenol blue, 0.05% xylene cyanol FF) was added to the sample. The samples were incubated in the boiling water bath for 4 min, and 2.5 μl of the sample was subjected to 12% acrylamide/bisacrylamide (19: 1), 8 m urea gel after prerun for 30 min. The gel was run in TBE buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, 50 mm boric acid, and 1 mm EDTA) at 45 W. The residues were positioned with the A + G ladders. Hierarchical Binding of OmpR-P to F1 Subsites—Each 20-bp F- and C-binding site for OmpR-P is composed of two 10-bp repetitive subsites, the a-site and the b-site, as shown in Fig. 1A. Earlier PCR selection of nine randomized sequences of the 3′-end of the F1 site revealed a consensus sequence of 12TTACAXXXX20 (the numbers indicate the base positions in the 20-bp F1 site from the 5′-end), in which the 14AC15 sequence is tightly conserved (11Harlocker S.L. Bergstrom L. Inouye M. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 26849-26856Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar). In addition to this consensus sequence, it is also known that the highly conserved G at the 11th position is important for OmpR-P binding (11Harlocker S.L. Bergstrom L. Inouye M. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 26849-26856Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar, 17Mizuno T. Mizushima S. J. Bacteriol. 1986; 168: 86-95Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Compared with these consensus sequences, the 10-bp F1b site, the 3′-end of the F1 site (GTTACATATT), contains all six consensus bases, whereas the 10-bp F1a site, the 5′-end of the F1 site (TTTACTTTTG), contains four of six consensus bases (Fig. 1A), suggesting that OmpR-P may have higher affinity for the F1b site than for the F1a site. To examine this possibility, two 20-mer DNA fragments, F1aF1a and F1bF1b, were synthesized. Note that most of the short constructs in the present study have four C:G base pair extensions (CCCC) at both the 5′- and 3′-ends to stabilize duplex formation as shown in Fig. 1B. As shown in Fig. 1B, binding to F1aF1a was barely detectable even at the highest concentration of OmpR-P used (80 nm; lane 12), whereas almost 90% of F1bF1b was bound at a concentration as low as 5 nm OmpR-P (lane 14). With the wild-type F1aF1b fragment, 50% binding to OmpR-P was observed between 5 and 10 nm OmpR-P (lanes 2 and 3, respectively). These observations are consistent with the previously reported Kd value of OmpR-P binding to the F1 site (10Head C.G. Tardy A. Kenney L.J. J. Mol. Biol. 1998; 281: 857-870Crossref PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar). These results indicate that OmpR-P binding to the F1a site in the F1 site depends on the initial binding of OmpR-P to the F1b site because OmpR-P is unable to bind to F1aF1a under the same condition. However, binding of one OmpR-P molecule to the F1b site is not enough to form a stable complex with the F1 site, because the mutation of the F1a site abolishes the binding of OmpR-P to the F1 site (11Harlocker S.L. Bergstrom L. Inouye M. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 26849-26856Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar). Therefore, for OmpR-P to form a stable complex with the F1 site, binding of two OmpR-P molecules to both F1a and F1b sites is necessary. In this sense the binding of two OmpR-P molecules to the F1 site is cooperative. We also carried out DNase I footprinting using the same 28-bp oligonucleotides used in the gel shift assay to monitor the binding of OmpR-P to the F1a and the F1b site. Because the amount of OmpR-P was increased, both the F1a and F1b sites in the wild-type F1 site (F1aF1b) were protected from DNase I digestion, in a cooperative manner (Fig. 1C, lanes 1–6). The protection of F1aF1a by OmpR-P (lanes 7–12) was significantly less compared with that of F1bF1b (lanes 13–18). This supports the hierarchy in the binding affinity of OmpR-P for these sequences (F1bF1b > F1aF1b > F1aF1a) consistent with the results of the gel mobility shift assay (Fig. 1B). G1 and 4ACA6 Are Essential for Optimal Binding of OmpR-P—We noticed that the G residue is highly conserved and is located at every 11th position of each F and C site except in the case of the F4 site (Fig. 1A). Because G11 has been shown to be important for OmpR-P binding to the F1 site (11Harlocker S.L. Bergstrom L. Inouye M. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 26849-26856Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar), we next examined its role in OmpR-P binding using the F1 and C1 sites. Because the F1 site has two G residues in the center at positions 10 and 11 (Fig. 1A), we tested which G residue contributes more to OmpR-P/F1 site interaction. Substitution of G10 (G10A; Fig. 2A, lanes 13–18) hardly affected the binding of OmpR-P to the DNA fragment as compared with the wild-type F1 sequence (lanes 1–6). On the other hand, the G11A mutation weakened the binding with a C50 value of 80 nm (lanes 7–12), ∼10 times greater than the C50 value observed with the wild-type F1 fragment. Mutation of both G residues (G10A/G11A; lanes 19–24) further destabilized the binding of OmpR-P, resulting in a C50 value of higher than 80 nm. These results indicate that contribution of the G11 residue is more significant in OmpR-P/F1 site interaction than that of the G10 residue. We performed a similar experiment with the C1 site, which has a single G residue at position 11 (Fig. 1A). When G11 was substituted with either C (Fig. 2B, lanes 6–10) or T (lanes 16–19), OmpR-P binding was significantly affected. These results further support the importance of the G11 residue both in F1 and C1 sites in OmpR-P binding. Interestingly, in the absence of G at position 11, a second mutation at position 10, T10G, elevated the affinity for OmpR-P (Fig. 2B, lanes 11–15), albeit weaker than wild type (lanes 1–5). This suggests that similar to the F1 site, the G residue at position 10 in the C1 site can also interact with OmpR-P. Both the G1 and A6 residues are absent in the F1a subsite (Fig. 1A). Therefore, we examined whether OmpR-P can bind to F1aF1a, if G1, A6, or both are introduced to mimic the F1b subsite. Indeed, when the T16A mutation was introduced in to create the ACA consensus sequence in the second F1a subsite, OmpR-P binding was substantially improved with a C50 value of ∼10 nm (Fig. 2C, lanes 7–12). Similarly, the T11G mutation also improved the C50 value to ∼10 nm (lanes 13–18). However, interestingly, if these mutations were combined together, they exerted a synergistic effect as the C50 value was lowered to less than 5 nm as can be seen with the T11G/T16A mutations (lanes 19–24), reaching a C50 value similar to that with the F1bF1b fragment (Fig. 1B, lanes 13–18). These results suggest that the G residue at position 1 of a subsite and the ACA consensus sequence are key for OmpR-P binding and are sufficient to elevate the affinity of F1aF1a to that of F1aF1b (Fig. 2A, lanes 1–6). Because the G11 residue is more important than G10, we speculated that having the G residue as the first position in each tandem repeated subsite is critical. Therefore, we further examined the role of the G residue for OmpR-P binding using an F1bF1b fragment. This fragment has the G residue at the first position of each subsite at G1 and G11, respectively. As shown in Fig. 2D, the G11A mutation slightly increased the C50 value. The G1A/G11A double mutant further increased the C50 value to ∼20 nm (lanes 13–18). This result indicates that the G residue located at the first position of each subsite is important for OmpR-P binding. Importance of the C5 and G11 Residues on the Upper Strand for OmpR-P Binding—In all F and C b-sites, the C:G pair at the fifth position is highly conserved, and it also exists in some of the a-sites (Fig. 1A). It has been shown that mutation of this C:G pair abolishes the binding of OmpR-P (11Harlocker S.L. Bergstrom L. Inouye M. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 26849-26856Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar). When the C:G pair at the 5th position in F1 (F1aF1b) was substituted with an A:T pair, binding to OmpR-P became undetectable under the conditions used (700 nm OmpR-P) (Fig. 3A, compare lanes 2 and 4). By exchanging one strand between the two duplexes used above, two other heteroduplexes having a C:T or A:G mismatched base pair at position 5 in the F1 site were formed. OmpR-P was still able to bind to the DNA fragment with the C:T mismatched pair (lane 6) but not with the A:G pair (lane 8), indicating that in the conserved C:G pair at the 5th position in the a-site, it is the C residue in the upper strand that is essential for OmpR-P binding; this is most likely the case for the b-site as well. A similar experiment was carried out to elucidate which residue in the G:C pair at the 11th position plays an important role for OmpR-P binding using the C1 site. When the G:C pair was substituted with the C:G or T:A pair, binding was very weak, even at concentrations of OmpR-P as high as 190 nm (Fig. 2B), suggesting that the G residue in this G:C pair is important for binding. Using the wild-type and mutated oligonucleotides, two heteroduplex DNA fragments were constructed. OmpR-P was still able to bind to the C1 fragment with the G:T mismatched pair at the 11th position (Fig. 3B, lanes 6–10) but not with the A:C pair (lanes 16–20). This confirmed that similar to the C:G pair at the 5th position, the G residue on the upper strand of the G:C pair at the 11th position is involved in OmpR-P binding. The replacement of the G residue with an Ile residue had little effect on OmpR-P binding (lanes 11–15), suggesting that the carbonyl group at position 6 of the purine ring may be directly involved in the interaction with OmpR-P. Nonphosphorylated OmpR Is Capable of Binding to F1bF1b—Non-phosphorylated OmpR is capable of binding to the F1 sequence with low affinity (more than a 10-fold difference in the Kd value as compared with that of OmpR-P (10Head C.G. Tardy A. Kenney L.J. J. Mol. Biol. 1998; 281: 857-870Crossref PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar)). However, interestingly, nonphosphorylated OmpR was able to bind to the F1bF1b fragment with a C50 value of ∼10 nm (Fig. 4A, lanes 19–24), which is very similar to the binding of OmpR-P to F1 (lanes 1–6). On the other hand, the affinity of OmpR to the F1 site was very weak, and its C50 value appears to be higher than 80 nm (lanes 13–18). Importantly, the high affinity of OmpR for the F1bF1b fragment can be further enhanced by its phosphorylation because more than 90% of the DNA is bound at 5 nm concentration of OmpR-P (lane 8). The N-terminal Domain Is Required for Cooperative Binding of OmpR to the F1 Site—We next compared the DNA binding activity of the C-terminal DNA-binding domain of OmpR (OmpRc) with that of OmpR and OmpR-P by DNase I footprinting. OmpR was able to protect both the F1a and F1b sites from DNase I digestion in a cooperative manner (Fig. 4B, lanes 2–6). When the F1bF1b fragment was used, the protection of both F1b sites was dramatically increased (lanes 13–17) (compare the F1b site in the F1aF1b fragment and the upper F1b site in the F1bF1b site). Phosphorylation of OmpR further enhanced protection of the F1aF1b (lanes 7–11) and F1bF1b (lanes 18–22) fragments. These results using DNase I footprinting and a 28-bp DNA fragment are in accordance with those obtained using the gel shift assay for OmpR-P binding to DNA (Fig. 4A). Therefore, DNase I footprinting experiments were then carried out using the F1, F1aF1a, or F1bF1b fragment with OmpRc. Interestingly, the F1b site in the F1 site was only protected at high concentrations of OmpRc (Fig. 4C, lanes 1–6), and the F1a site was not protected at all even at the highest OmpRc concentration (lane 6). Consistent with this result, both F1a sites in the F1aF1a fragment were poorly protected from DNase I digestion (lanes 7–12), whereas both F1b sites in the F1bF1b fragment were well protected (lanes 13–18), confirming that OmpRc has higher affinity to F1b than to F1a. These results indicate that the N-terminal domain is required for OmpR to bind to the F1a site in the F1 fragment and are consistent with the fact that OmpR-P has higher affinity for the F1b site than for the F1a site. OmpR-P Binding to DNA: a Two-by-Two Mode—We previously showed that only an even number of OmpR-P molecules can bind to the F1-F2-F3 fragment, because the OmpR-P·DNA complexes detected contained only two, four, or six OmpR-P molecules (11Harlocker S.L. Bergstrom L. Inouye M. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 26849-26856Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar). To further examine this two-by-two mode of OmpR-P binding to DNA, we synthesized an oligonucleotide consisting of three tandem F1b sequences, F1bF1bF1b. As a control, another oligonucleotide, F1-F2a (F1aF1bF2a), was synthesized that was previously shown to bind only two OmpR-P molecules (11Harlocker S.L. Bergstrom L. Inouye M. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 26849-26856Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar). To accurately estimate the number of OmpR-P molecules binding to the DNA fragments, mixtures of OmpR-P and PrS2-OmpR-P were used (11Harlocker S.L. Bergstrom L. Inouye M. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 26849-26856Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar). PrS2-OmpR is a hybrid protein, in which two tandemly repeated N-terminal domains (a total of 184 amino acid residues) from Myxococcus xanthus protein S is linked to the N-terminal end of the OmpR molecule. The resulting PrS2-OmpR is 20 kDa larger than OmpR. Importantly, this hybrid protein exhibited binding activity similar to that of OmpR-P upon phosphorylation with EnvZc (11Harlocker S.L. Bergstrom L. Inouye M. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 26849-26856Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar). As shown in lanes 1–8 of Fig. 5, only three complexes were detectable with increasing concentrations of PrS2-OmpR-P and concomitantly decreasing concentrations of OmpR-P. The protein·DNA complex with the fastest mobility contained only OmpR-P molecules, whereas the slowest mobility complex contained only PrS2-OmpR-P molecules. Therefore, the center complex should contain one molecule each of OmpR-P and PrS2-OmpR-P. We conclude that only two OmpR-P molecules are able to bind to the F1F2a fragment. When a similar experiment was carried out with the F1bF1bF1b fragment, again only three complexes were detectable (Fig. 5, lanes 9–16). This result demonstrates that even if a DNA fragment contains three high affinity OmpR-P-binding sites, not more than two OmpR-P molecules can bind to the fragment, likely in two different modes as illustrated in Fig. 5A. All b-sites Have Higher Affinity for OmpR-P than Their Cognate Upstream a-sites—Thus far we demonstrated that there is a distinct OmpR-P binding hierarchy between F1a and F1b subsites consistent with the F1b sequence having the consensus G1 and ACA residues relative to F1a. A similar tendency is observed in all F and C sites without exception (Fig. 1A), indicating that all of the downstream b-sites have a higher affinity than their cognate upstream a-sites. Thus, we next examined OmpR-P binding to all of the other F and C sites using the same strategy used for the F1 site. We synthesized 40-bp F1-F2aF2a and F1-F2bF2b for studying the F2 site and 60-bp F1-F2-F3aF3a and F1-F2-F3bF3b for studying the F3 site. Note that to detect the binding of OmpR-P to the F2 and F3 sites, its binding to the F1 site and the F1-F2 site, respectively, was required. Binding of OmpR-P to the F1-F2aF2a fragment was significantly reduced (Fig. 6A, lanes 8–14), because even at the highest concentration of OmpR-P used (lane 14), the binding of four OmpR-P molecules to this fragment was marginal in comparison with that to the wild-type F1-F2 fragment (lane 7). Surprisingly, the binding of two OmpR-P molecules to the F1 site in this F1-F2aF2a was also affected. However, this reduction of OmpR-P binding to the F1 site in F1-F2aF2a was abolished by a point mutation in either highly conserved C5 (in first F2a site) or C15 (in second F2a site) in F1-F2aF2a (data not shown), suggesting that somehow the weak binding of OmpR-P to F2aF2a negatively affects the overall"

In Synechocystis PhQ-deficient mutants, the level of active PSI is reduced to about 50–60% of the wild type (WT), while Photosystem II (PSII) activity remains unaltered. These mutants grow photoautotrophically under low light conditions because the missing quinone in PSI is functionally replaced by plastoquinone (PQ) (3Johnson T.W. Shen G. Zybailov B. Kolling D. Reategui R. Beauparlant S. Vassiliev I.R. Bryant D.A. Jones A.D. Golbeck J.H. Chitnis P.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 8523-8530Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar). In plants, relatively little is known about PhQ biosynthesis, although biochemical analysis suggested a metabolic pathway similar to that of bacteria and that the principle reactions occur at the chloroplast envelope membrane (7Schultz G. Ellerbrock B.H. Soll J. Eur. J. Biochem. 1981; 117: 329-332Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). The menA homologous Arabidopsis thaliana gene, AtmenA, was recently demonstrated to be essentially required for PhQ biosynthesis and accumulation of PSI. However, conversely to the Synechocystis men mutants, the AtmenA knock-out plant was severely affected in the accumulation of PSII and PQ as well (8Shimada H. Ohno R. Shibata M. Ikegami I. Onai K. Ohto M.A. Takamiya K. Plant J. 2005; 41: 627-637Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). PhQ is also known as vitamin K1, a compound essential for human health involved in various physiological processes ranging from blood clot and bone metabolism to growth control and signal transduction (9Saxena S.P. Israels E.D. Israels L.G. Apoptosis. 2001; 6: 57-68Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). The major source of vitamin K in human nutrition is green vegetables (9Saxena S.P. Israels E.D. Israels L.G. Apoptosis. 2001; 6: 57-68Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar), and circumstantial evidence suggests that also in plants PhQ could have additional functions apart from being a PSI cofactor. Some reports demonstrated the presence of PhQ in the plasma membrane, where it could act as a sensor/scavenger of reactive oxygen species and/or as an intermediate in cross-membrane electron transport chains (10Lochner K. Döring O. Böttger M. Biofactors. 2003; 18: 73-78Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar, 11Bridge A. Barr R. Morre D.J. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2000; 1463: 448-458Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). In the course of a genetic study aimed at PSI biogenesis using four allelic phylloquinone absence (pha) mutants in Arabidopsis, we identified an essential nuclear plant gene for PhQ biosynthesis, designated PHYLLO, which encodes a fusion of four formerly eubacterial genes of this pathway. We also demonstrate that both forms of isochorismate synthases, ICS1 and ICS2, encoded by two individual menF homologous genes in Arabidopsis contribute to the first step of vitamin K1 biosynthesis. An independent regulation of ICS1 secures an early branching point from the PhQ biosynthetic pathway to ensure induction of the salicylic acid (SA) metabolic route important under conditions of phytopathogenic attack (12Wildermuth M.C. Dewdney J. Wu G. Ausubel F.M. Nature. 2001; 414: 562-565Crossref PubMed Scopus (1640) Google Scholar). The findings suggest that the PHYLLO gene in plants has been shaped by subsequent gene fusion, duplication, and splitting events during evolution and that its product takes part in a multienzyme complex (metabolon) for PhQ biosynthesis. Furthermore, our data support the idea that PhQ could potentially exhibit functions other than connected with PSI electron transport in the plant cell. Selection and Growth of Mutant Plants—The pha1 (accession Wassilewskija) and pha2 (Columbia) lines were selected from Arabidopsis mutant collections (13Meurer J. Meierhoff K. Westhoff P. Planta. 1996; 198: 385-396Crossref PubMed Scopus (176) Google Scholar). Pha3, pha4, ics1, and ics2 mutants were obtained from the T-DNA insertion lines Salk_137597, Salk_039309, Salk_042603 and Salk_073287, respectively (Salk Institute, La Jolla, Ca). Insertion sites and the genotypes of these lines were confirmed by PCR, nucleotide sequence, and segregation analyses. The mutants were grown on sucrose-supplemented Murashige and Skoog medium under a 14 h light/10 h dark period at a light intensity of 20 μmol photons m–2 s–1 (13Meurer J. Meierhoff K. Westhoff P. Planta. 1996; 198: 385-396Crossref PubMed Scopus (176) Google Scholar). For feeding experiments hypocotyls of 3-week-old plants were cut off at their base, and plants were transferred and kept for 5 days either on Murashige and Skoog medium or on medium containing 1.0 mm NA (ABCR, Karlsruhe, Germany). Immunology, Gene Expression, and Cellular Localization—Immunoblot analysis, isolation of poly(A)+ mRNA and total RNA, reverse transcription, as well as RNA gel blot analysis were carried out as described previously (13Meurer J. Meierhoff K. Westhoff P. Planta. 1996; 198: 385-396Crossref PubMed Scopus (176) Google Scholar, 14Amann K. Lezhneva L. Wanner G. Herrmann R.G. Meurer J.

Meurer J. Plant J. 2004; 38: 740-753Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). The probes labeled for RNA gel blot analysis were amplified with primers specific for the PHYLLO locus. Quantitative two-step real-time reverse transcription-PCR for pha3 and WT plants was carried out essentially as described (16Lezhneva L. Meurer J. Plant J. 2004; 38: 740-753Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). A PCR product amplified from the cDNA clone RAFL 09-32-CO5 (17Seki M. Narusaka M. Kamiya A. Ishida J. Satou M. Sakurai T. Nakajima M. Enju A. Akiyama K. Oono Y. Muramatsu M. Hayashizaki Y. Kawai J. Carninci P. Itoh M. Ishii Y. Arakawa T. Shibata K. Shinagawa A. Shinozaki K. Science. 2002; 296: 141-145Crossref PubMed Scopus (551) Google Scholar) using specific primers containing SalI restriction sites was cloned into the RFP expression vector pOL-DsRed (14Amann K. Lezhneva L. Wanner G. Herrmann R.G. Meurer J. Plant Cell. 2004; 16: 3084-3097Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). This produced a translational fusion of the MenF module of PHYLLO with the Discosoma sp. (DsRed) protein. The resulting fusion and the control DsRed were transiently expressed in tobacco protoplasts according to the standard polyethylene glycol protocol and images were captured using a fluorescence microscope equipped with a digital camera (Axioplan; Zeiss, Jena, Germany) (14Amann K. Lezhneva L. Wanner G. Herrmann R.G. Meurer J. Plant Cell. 2004; 16: 3084-3097Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). Fluorimetry and Spectroscopy—Measurements of PSI and PSII activity were performed with the pulse amplitude modulated fluorimeter PAM101 connected with emitter detector subunits (Walz, Effeltrich, Germany) and equipped with a data acquisition system to record fast changes (13Meurer J. Meierhoff K. Westhoff P. Planta. 1996; 198: 385-396Crossref PubMed Scopus (176) Google Scholar, 18Klughammer C. Schreiber U. Planta. 1994; 192: 261-268Crossref Google Scholar). Sequence Analysis, Map-based Cloning, and Genetic Complementation—502 segregating F2 mutant plants from backcrosses of pha1 and pha2 with the WT (accession Landsberg erecta) were mapped using available and self-generated PCR-based molecular markers. Sequences of the RAFL 09-32-CO5 cDNA clone (form 1) (17Seki M. Narusaka M. Kamiya A. Ishida J. Satou M. Sakurai T. Nakajima M. Enju A. Akiyama K. Oono Y. Muramatsu M. Hayashizaki Y. Kawai J.

Science. 2002; 296: 141-145Crossref PubMed Scopus (551) Google Scholar), PHYLLO from Arabidopsis, ICS1, and ICS2 are available under the GenBank™ accession numbers DQ084385, DQ084386, AY056055, and NM_101744, respectively. The Arabidopsis homologues of the eubacterial MenB (At1g60550), MenA (At1g60600), MenG (At1g23360), and MenE (comprising a large gene family) were identified by BLAST searches (19Altschul S.F. Madden T.L. Schaffer A.A. Zhang J. Zhang Z. Miller W. Lipman D.J. Nucleic Acids Res. 1997; 25: 3389-3402Crossref PubMed Scopus (60233) Google Scholar). The genomic sequences of the PHYLLO locus from Chlamydomonas, Populus trichocarpa, and Thalassiosira pseudonana were retrieved from genome.jgi-psf.org/euk_cur1.html, and the rice PHYLLO homologue was found in the BAC clone GenBank™ accession number AP005800. These sequences were annotated by ab initio and comparative procedures as described previously (20Gross J. Stein J.R. Fett-Neto A.G. Fett J.P. Genet. Mol. Biol. 2003; 26: 477-497Crossref Scopus (106) Google Scholar). For complementation analysis, the RAFL 09-32-CO5 clone was cleaved with EcoRV and SpeI, and the resulting fragment was inserted into the plant binary transformation vector pS001 (14Amann K. Lezhneva L. Wanner G. Herrmann R.G. Meurer J. Plant Cell. 2004; 16: 3084-3097Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar) within compatible SmaI and XbaI restriction sites, resulting in the clone binC05. To generate a full-length cDNA for complementation of pha mutants, the XbaI- and Bst1107I-cleaved fragment of binC05 was replaced by a PCR product modified by insertion of a guanine within the stop codon (form 4). Plants were transformed via Agrobacterium, and the offspring was selected with 10 mg/liter sulfadiazine (14Amann K. Lezhneva L. Wanner G. Herrmann R.G. Meurer J. Plant Cell. 2004; 16: 3084-3097Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). All primers used in this work are available upon request. High Performance Liquid Chromatography (HPLC)—100–500 mg of ground material from leaves of 2–3-week-old seedlings were extracted with 2 volumes of n-heptane at 20 °C overnight and re-extracted with 100 μl of n-heptane. The combined extract was analyzed using a LiChrosphere Si 100 column (10 × 250 mm, 5 μm) with n-heptane/2-propanol (99.05 + 0.05) as eluant at a flow rate of 1.0 ml/min. PhQ and PQ were detected by their absorbance at 270 and 254 nm, respectively, using a photodiode array detector (SPD-M10Avp; Shimadzu, Duisburg, Germany). Characterization of pha Mutants—In an attempt to identify factors involved in PSI biogenesis in higher plants, the seedling lethal pha1 and pha2 mutants were selected based on their high chlorophyll fluorescence (hcf) phenotype, associated with photosynthetic lesions (13Meurer J. Meierhoff K. Westhoff P. Planta. 1996; 198: 385-396Crossref PubMed Scopus (176) Google Scholar, 14Amann K. Lezhneva L. Wanner G. Herrmann R.G. Meurer J. Plant Cell. 2004; 16: 3084-3097Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). Further examination of these mutants by HPLC revealed that they completely lacked PhQ (Fig. 2A, Table 1). Despite of this absence, pha1 and pha2 exhibited 5–15% of WT PSI activity (Fig. 2B). The potential yield of PSII (minimal fluorescence yield/the maximum fluorescence yield (Fv/Fm)) was reduced to about 75% of WT (Fig. 2C) demonstrating that this photosystem is only moderately affected as in many other PSI mutants (14Amann K. Lezhneva L. Wanner G. Herrmann R.G. Meurer J. Plant Cell. 2004; 16: 3084-3097Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar, 15Lezhneva L. Amann K. Meurer J. Plant J. 2004; 37: 174-185Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar, 16Lezhneva L. Meurer J. Plant J. 2004; 38: 740-753Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). Chlorophyll fluorescence analysis revealed that mutant plants failed to quench the fluorescence efficiently upon illumination, indicating that the limiting step of the linear electron transport lies behind PSII (Fig. 2C). Immunoblot analysis showed a reduced accumulation of the PSI core complex reaching ∼5–15% of the WT level. The other thylakoid membrane complexes, i.e. ATP synthase, cytochrome b6f complex, NAD(P)H-dependent dehydrogenase, and PSII, however, accumulated at almost normal levels (Fig. 2D). As it was also evident from in vivo labeling experiments of thylakoid membrane proteins showing normal translation of PSI subunits in pha mutants (data not shown), the present data unequivocally indicate a specific reduction of PSI stability in pha mutants. Conversely, the lack of vitamin K1 in pha1 and pha2 is not a secondary effect related to the failure of plants to accumulate PSI, since other Arabidopsis mutants, like hcf101 and hcf145, with PSI amounts below 5% (15Lezhneva L. Amann K. Meurer J. Plant J. 2004; 37: 174-185Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar, 16Lezhneva L. Meurer J. Plant J. 2004; 38: 740-753Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar), possess normal levels of PhQ (Table 1).TABLE 1PhQ and PQ content of wild type and Arabidopsis PSI mutant plantsLinesPhQPQ-NA+NA-NA+NAWild-type3.04 ± 0.525.15 ± 0.9614.95 ± 1.0115.52 ± 1.33hcf1453.21 ± 0.425.36 ± 0.367.93 ± 0.278.24 ± 0.74hcf1013.22 ± 0.355.63 ± 0.067.35 ± 0.197.41 ± 0.60pha10.00.41 ± 0.108.05 ± 1.6611.09 ± 2.31pha20.00.59 ± 0.088.74 ± 1.1711.00 ± 0.82pha30.00.48 ± 0.13NDNDpha40.0NDNDNDics1/ics1; ics2/ics20.0ND6.48 ± 1.87NDics1/ics1; ICS2/ics20.60 ± 0.11NDNDND Open table in a new tab Identification of Four pha Mutations in the PHYLLO Locus—To identify possible PhQ biosynthetic defects, pha1 and pha2 mutants were grown in the presence of the metabolic precursor 1,4-dihydroxy-2-naphthoate (NA) (Fig. 1). Although the pha mutants accumulate only 41 ± 4% chlorophyll based on fresh weight, the NA-fed plants completely restore wild-type levels (Fig. 2E). NA feeding recovered also the PhQ content in pha mutants to about 0.5 μg/g fresh weight (Table 1) accompanied by a reestablishment of the accumulation and activity of PSI to about 50 and 70% of WT levels, respectively. (Fig. 2, A–E), indicating a function of the mutated genes in the first steps of vitamin K1 biosynthesis (Fig. 1). Accordingly, both mutants were genetically mapped on the lower part of chromosome I (BAC clone T6L1) into a 9,788-bp interval (PHYLLO locus), surprisingly, revealing homology with four eubacterial men genes, menF, menD, menC, and menH (Fig. 3A). Two additional mutant lines, pha3 and pha4, which contain T-DNA insertions within this locus (Fig. 3A) also exhibited the pha phenotype as well as PhQ and photosynthetic recovery after NA supply (Fig. 2, A and B, Table 1), reinforcing the essential function of the PHYLLO locus in vitamin K1 biosynthesis. PHYLLO, a Tetramodular Fusion of Four men Genes—Four lines of evidence demonstrate unequivocally that the observed regions in the PHYLLO locus homologous to four men genes represent a single, monocistronic gene. (i) All four pha mutants belong to the same complementation group (Figs. 2, A–C, and 4A). (ii) In the pha3 background (T-DNA insertion in the menF 5′ region, Fig. 3A) no accumulation of transcripts related to menD and menH regions could be detected by real-time RT-PCR analysis (data not shown). (iii) RNA gel blot analysis revealed a single band of 5.5 kb when probing 5′, central, and 3′ parts of the PHYLLO locus (Fig. 4B), indicating that a unique transcript covers the entire PHYLLO interval. (iv) The most convincing evidence is the existence of a functional full-length coding frame of the complete PHYLLO gene (see below). Sequence analysis of a full-length cDNA (17Seki M. Narusaka M. Kamiya A. Ishida J. Satou M. Sakurai T. Nakajima M. Enju A. Akiyama K. Oono Y. Muramatsu M. Hayashizaki Y. Kawai J. Carninci P. Itoh M. Ishii Y. Arakawa T. Shibata K. Shinagawa A. Shinozaki K. Science. 2002; 296: 141-145Crossref PubMed Scopus (551) Google Scholar) and overlapping RT-PCR products revealed that PHYLLO is composed of 28 exons encoding all four men-homologous regions (Fig. 3A). Additionally, three alternative splicing events (forms 1–3) were detected between exons 7 and 8 (Fig. 3B). Both form 1 and form 2 carry premature termination codons leading to the expression only of a truncated menF homologous region. Differently, the form 3 contains shorter boundaries of exons 7 and 8, bypassing any stop codon, and encodes a fused reading frame of 5,347 bp comprising all four men-homologous modules (Fig. 3B). We conclude that only the form 3 corresponds to the functional full-length phyllo transcript. Accordingly, a cDNA corresponding to the stop codon-containing form 1 transformed into the background of all pha mutants did not complement the mutations (data not shown). To obtain a full-length cDNA encoding a single tetra-modular reading frame of the entire PHYLLO locus, a guanine nucleotide was inserted into the context of the stop codon of form 1 (Fig. 3B). The resulting form 4 successfully complemented the pha3 and pha4 mutants (Fig. 4, C–H) allowing photoautotrophic growth, PhQ accumulation, and recovery of PSI activity (data not shown). Conservation of the PHYLLO Locus—The PHYLLO product (form 3) consists of 1,715 deduced amino acid residues comprising the four Men modules preceded by a predicted transit peptide that directs the PHYLLO protein to the chloroplasts (Fig. 5). BLAST similarities (19Altschul S.F. Madden T.L. Schaffer A.A. Zhang J. Zhang Z. Miller W. Lipman D.J. Nucleic Acids Res. 1997; 25: 3389-3402Crossref PubMed Scopus (60233) Google Scholar), ranging from 40 to 50%, and the presence of highly conserved motifs confirmed the relationship of the four PHYLLO modules with known Men proteins in eubacteria. A cluster of all four men homologues is also present in the genomes of the plants P. trichocarpa and rice (Fig. 6A), implying conservation of PHYLLO in monocots and dicots. Furthermore, an entire PHYLLO locus is also present in the nuclear genomes of the green algae Ostreococcus tauri strain OTTH0595 and Chlamydomonas reinhardtii. Interestingly, the diatom alga Thalassiosira pseudonana, which arose from secondary endosymbiosis in the red algae lineage (21Lopez P.J. Desclés J. Allen A.E. Bowler C. Curr. Opin. Biotechnol. 2005; 16: 180-186Crossref PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar), also contains a PHYLLO locus, in which the menH module precedes the menC module (Fig. 6A). These results support a conservation of the fused PHYLLO locus within the green and red plant lineages.FIGURE 6Conservation of the PHYLLO locus.

The fissure in the PHYLLO MenF module of plants remark the gene splitting event of the chorismate binding domain (pfam00425).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Remarkably, men genes are clustered and partially imbedded in operons in some eubacterial genomes and in plastomes of the red algae Cyanidium caldarium and Cyanidioschyzon merolae (Fig. 6A). This reinforces the idea that PHYLLO derived from the structure of an eubacterial operon, which was presumably transferred during endosymbiosis from the chloroplast into the nucleus of the host genome (22Martin W. Rujan T. Richly E. Hansen A. Cornelsen S. Lins T. Leister D. Stoebe B. Hasegawa M. Penny D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 12246-12251Crossref PubMed Scopus (908) Google Scholar). Once the operon has been transferred evolutionary driving forces could have established the gene cluster as a tetramodular fusion. The presence of PHYLLO in diatoms indicates that the fusion event happened either once before divergence of the green and red lineages but individual men genes have been maintained in plastomes of some red algae at the evolutionary base of the chlorophyll c-containing clade or the fusion occurred at least two times independently. ICS1 and ICS2 Are Required for PhQ Biosynthesis in Arabidopsis—The evolutionary dynamics of the PHYLLO product becomes even more intriguing considering the fact that the C-terminal chorismate binding domain (12Wildermuth M.C. Dewdney J. Wu G. Ausubel F.M. Nature. 2001; 414: 562-565Crossref PubMed Scopus (1640) Google Scholar) is absent from the MenF module (isochorismate synthase) of PHYLLO in higher plants (Fig. 6, A and B). Conversely, this module has maintained its structural integrity in the PHYLLO homologues of the green and red algae lineages (Fig. 6, A and B), suggesting a recent gene splitting event in the PHYLLO locus, which occurred only in higher plants. Therefore, we propose that the PHYLLO menF5′ module, whose product is only homologous to the N-terminal part of ICS, is not functional and that the ICS activity has been taken over by two additional genes (ICS1 and ICS2) present in Arabidopsis. To test this possibility, single and double knock-outs of these genes were analyzed (Fig. 7, A–E). Only the double knock-out plants showed the pha phenotype (Fig. 2, A–C, Table 1), indicating that, under normal conditions, ICS1 and ICS2 overlap in their function to synthesize PhQ (Fig. 1) and that the product of the menF 5′ module of PHYLLO is unable to complement this deficiency. The Bulk of PhQ in Arabidopsis Is Not Associated with PSI—Interestingly, offspring homozygous for ICS1 (ics1/ics1) and heterozygous for ICS2 (ics2/ICS2) contains only about 18% of the WT PhQ content (Table 1) but 50–70% of WT PSI activity (data not shown). Similarly, ∼15% PhQ accumulation in the pha mutants after NA supply (Fig. 2A and Table 1) was sufficient to recover about 50% of PSI amount and up to 70% activity (Fig. 2, B–D). Three major conclusions can be drawn from this non-proportional numerical correlation: (i) PSI is a preferential metabolic sink for newly synthesized PhQ. (ii) An extrapolated amount of maximal 50% PhQ is sufficient for 100% PSI activity. (iii) Consequently, at least half of the PhQ is not associated to PSI and may be located elsewhere in plant membranes. The PhQ pool can be expanded even further from about 3.1 to 5.4 μg/g fresh weight when WT, hcf145, and hcf101 plants are fed with NA (Table 1), notably, without affecting PSI activity (data not shown). The fact that large amounts of vitamin K1 in Arabidopsis were not associated with PSI reinforces previous ideas suggesting that PhQ presumably exerts other functions in plant plasma membranes (10Lochner K. Döring O. Böttger M. Biofactors. 2003; 18: 73-78Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar, 11Bridge A. Barr R. Morre D.J. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2000; 1463: 448-458Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). Essential Role of Phylloquinone in Higher Plants—The analysis of pha and ics mutants showed that PhQ is essentially required for photoautotrophic growth in Arabidopsis. The deficiency at the level of PSI accumulation, which could be partially overcome by supplementation of the PhQ metabolic precursor NA, indicates that the lack of the cofactor was the primary cause for instability of PSI proteins. Nevertheless, 5–15% of the PSI core subunits and a corresponding activity of this complex could be detected in pha mutants and ics double knock-outs. This could be explained by a functional replacement of the missing PhQ by an alternative quinone, such as PQ, as has similarly been reported for Synechocystis men mutants (3Johnson T.W. Shen G. Zybailov B. Kolling D. Reategui R. Beauparlant S. Vassiliev I.R. Bryant D.A. Jones A.D. Golbeck J.H. Chitnis P.R. J. Biol.

https://openalex.org/W2078894085,"Seasonal hibernation in mammals is under a unique adaptation system that protects organisms from various harmful events, such as lowering of body temperature (Tb), during hibernation. However, the precise factors controlling hibernation remain unknown. We have previously demonstrated a decrease in hibernation-specific protein (HP) complex in the blood of chipmunks during hibernation. Here, HP is identified as a candidate hormone for hibernation. In chipmunks kept in constant cold and darkness, HP is regulated by an individual free-running circannual rhythm that correlates with hibernation. The level of HP complex in the brain increases coincident with the onset of hibernation. Such HP regulation proceeds independently of Tb changes in constant warmth, and Tb decreases only when brain HP is increased in the cold. Blocking brain HP activity using an antibody decreases the duration of hibernation. We suggest that HP, a target of endogenously generated circannual rhythm, carries hormonal signals essential for hibernation to the brain."
https://openalex.org/W1967980238,"The biochemical basis that regulates the timely and selective opening of the blood-testis barrier (BTB) to migrating preleptotene/leptotene spermatocytes at stage VIII of the epithelial cycle in adult rat testes is virtually unknown. Recent studies have shown that cytokines (e.g. transforming growth factor (TGF)-β3) may play a crucial role in this event. However, much of this information relies on the use of toxicants (e.g. CdCl2), making it difficult to relay these findings to normal testicular physiology. Here we report that overexpression of TGF-β3 in primary Sertoli cells cultured in vitro indeed perturbed the tight junction (TJ) barrier with a concomitant decline in the production of BTB constituent proteins as follows: occludin, N-cadherin, and ZO-1. Additionally, local administration of TGF-β3 to testes in vivo was shown to reversibly perturb the BTB integrity and Sertoli-germ cell adhesion via the p38 MAPK and ERK signaling pathways. Most importantly, the simultaneous activation of p38 and ERK signaling pathways is dependent on the association of the TGF-β3-TβR1 complex with adaptors TAB1 and CD2AP because if TβR1 was associated preferentially with CD2AP, only Sertoli-germ cell adhesion was perturbed without compromising the BTB. Collectively, these data illustrate that local production of TGF-β3, and perhaps other TGF-βs and cytokines, by Sertoli and germ cells into the microenvironment at the BTB during spermatogenesis transiently perturbs the BTB and Sertoli-germ cell adhesion to facilitate germ cell migration when the activated TβRI interacts with adaptors TAB1 and CD2AP. However, TGF-β3 selectively disrupts Sertoli-germ cell adhesion in the seminiferous epithelium to facilitate germ cell migration without compromising BTB when TβRI interacts only with adaptor CD2AP. The biochemical basis that regulates the timely and selective opening of the blood-testis barrier (BTB) to migrating preleptotene/leptotene spermatocytes at stage VIII of the epithelial cycle in adult rat testes is virtually unknown. Recent studies have shown that cytokines (e.g. transforming growth factor (TGF)-β3) may play a crucial role in this event. However, much of this information relies on the use of toxicants (e.g. CdCl2), making it difficult to relay these findings to normal testicular physiology. Here we report that overexpression of TGF-β3 in primary Sertoli cells cultured in vitro indeed perturbed the tight junction (TJ) barrier with a concomitant decline in the production of BTB constituent proteins as follows: occludin, N-cadherin, and ZO-1. Additionally, local administration of TGF-β3 to testes in vivo was shown to reversibly perturb the BTB integrity and Sertoli-germ cell adhesion via the p38 MAPK and ERK signaling pathways.

In adult mammalian testes, such as rats, the blood-testis barrier (BTB) 2The abbreviations used are: BTB, blood-testis barrier; JNK, c-Jun NH2-terminal kinase; Co-IP, co-immunoprecipitation; RT, reverse transcription; TGF, transforming growth factor; MAP, mitogen-activated protein; MAPK, MAP kinase; ERK, extracellular signal-regulated kinase; TJ, tight junction; AJ, adherens junction; ES, ectoplasmic specialization; ANOVA, analysis of variance; ER, endoplasmic reticulum; TER, transepithelial electrical resistance; SC, Sertoli cell. is one of the “tightest” barriers in the mammalian body, comparable with the blood-brain barrier (1Mruk D.D. Cheng C.Y. Trends Endocr. Metab. 2004; 15: 439-447Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar, 2Wong C.H. Cheng C.Y. Curr. Top Dev.

Yet the BTB must “open” (or restructure/disassemble) at stages VII–VIII of the epithelial cycle to accommodate the migration of preleptotene and leptotene spermatocytes across the barrier but remain “closed” at other stages throughout spermatogenesis (4Russell L.D. Am. J. Anat. 1977; 148: 313-328Crossref PubMed Scopus (396) Google Scholar). Although detailed morphological studies of the BTB were unraveled in the 1960s (5Pelletier R.M. Byers S.W. Microsc. Res. Tech. 1992; 20: 3-33Crossref PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar, 6Dym M. Fawcett D.W. Biol. Reprod. 1970; 3: 308-326Crossref PubMed Scopus (887) Google Scholar), it remains a biological mystery how germ cells can traverse the BTB while barrier function is maintained during spermatogenesis. This is largely because of the lack of a suitable in vivo model in the field to study BTB dynamics. Recent studies have illustrated that the Sertoli cell tight junction (TJ) permeability barrier is regulated, at least in part, by testosterone (7Chung N. Cheng C.Y. Endocrinology. 2001; 142: 1878-1888Crossref PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar, 8Janecki A. Jakubowiak A. Steinberger A. Toxicol. Appl. Pharmacol. 1992; 112: 51-57Crossref PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar), possibly via its effects on the steady-state levels of occludin and ZO-1 (7Chung N. Cheng C.Y. Endocrinology. 2001; 142: 1878-1888Crossref PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar). Furthermore, the BTB is utilizing a unique “engagement” and “disengagement” mechanism between adherens junction (AJ) and TJ to facilitate germ cell movement in which AJs (e.g. basal ectoplasmic specialization (ES), a testis-specific cell-cell actin-based AJ type) can be transiently disrupted without compromising the TJ barrier (9Xia W. Wong C.H. Lee N.P.Y. Lee W.M. Cheng C.Y. J. Cell. Physiol. 2005; 205: 141-157Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar, 10Yan H.H.N. Cheng C.Y. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2005; 102: 11722-11727Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). Yet the biochemical mechanism that induces transient TJ “opening” to facilitate germ cell migration is not known. Recent studies have shown that TGF-β3 administered to Sertoli cells cultured in vitro could perturb the TJ barrier by reducing the protein levels of occludin and ZO-1 (11Lui W.Y. Lee W.M. Cheng C.Y. Endocrinology. 2001; 142: 1865-1877Crossref PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar). Interestingly, cadmium-induced BTB restructuring in vivo was also associated with an induction of TGF-β3 and an activation of the p38 MAPK concomitant with a reduction in the protein levels of occludin/ZO-1 and N-cadherin/β-catenin at the BTB (12Wong C.H. Mruk D.D. Lui W.Y. Cheng C.Y. J. Cell Sci. 2004; 117: 783-798Crossref PubMed Scopus (204) Google Scholar). Although results of these studies were obtained by using in vivo animal models involving toxicants, such as CdCl2, they have implicated the crucial role of TGF-β3 in BTB regulation. Because Sertoli and germ cells are both known to produce TGF-β3 (13Skinner M.K. Endocr. Rev. 1991; 12: 45-77Crossref PubMed Scopus (584) Google Scholar, 14Xia W. Mruk D.D. Lee W.M. Cheng C.Y. Cytokine Growth Factor Rev. 2005; 16: 469-493Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar), we hypothesize that this cytokine is released locally into the microenvironment at the BTB to regulate the opening of TJ at stage VIII of the epithelial cycle via the p38 MAPK pathway. Furthermore, a recent study has illustrated that TGF-β3 limits its action at the AJ (e.g. apical ES) without perturbing the BTB integrity when only the ERK signaling pathway is activated (15Xia W. Cheng C.Y. Dev. Biol. 2005; 280: 321-343Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). We speculate that a unique mechanism is in place involving adaptors, such as CD2AP (CD2-associated protein) and TAB1 (TAK1-binding protein 1) (14Xia W. Mruk D.D. Lee W.M. Cheng C.Y. Cytokine Growth Factor Rev. 2005; 16: 469-493Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar), which selects the appropriate downstream signaling events of TGF-β3so that it either induces restructuring at the BTB and Sertoli-germ cell adhesion or limits its effects on cell adhesion without perturbing the BTB integrity. We thus sought to (i) delineate the intriguing interactions between the TGF-β3-TβRI protein complex and the two adaptors, CD2AP and TAB1, in the testis, and (ii) determine how these interactions selectively activated the downstream signal transducers of TGF-β3, which, in turn, led to restructuring at the BTB and/or Sertoli-germ cell interface. The testis apparently is using such a novel mechanism to regulate restructuring at the Sertoli-germ cell interface to facilitate germ cell movement across the epithelium during spermatogenesis while maintaining the BTB integrity. In the course of this investigation, we have also unraveled a potentially useful in vivo model to study BTB dynamics. Animals—Sprague-Dawley rats were purchased from Charles River Breeding Laboratories (Kingston, NY) and were housed at The Rockefeller University Laboratory Animal Research Center with a 12:12-h light/dark cycles with free access to water and standard chow. The use of Sprague-Dawley rats for the studies described here was approved by The Rockefeller University Animal Care and Use Committee with Protocol Numbers 03017, 03040, and 06018. Transient Transfection of Primary Sertoli Cell Cultures with Plasmid Containing TGFβ3 cDNA and the Effects on Sertoli Cell TJ Permeability Barrier—pCI-neo mammalian expression vector (Promega) containing the full-length sequence encoding rat TGF-β3 was prepared using the following specific primers (GenBank™ accession number NM_013174): 5′-CTGGCCTCGTTCCTGAATTCACACATGAAGATG-3′ (sense, 375–407); 5′-TTCGCCTCCTCTGTTCTAGACTGGCCTCAGCT-3′ (antisense, 1663–1632). Two bases (boldface) were mutated to create the corresponding EcoRI and XbaI cloning sites (underlined). The authenticity of this full-length clone was confirmed by direct nucleotide sequencing at Genewiz prior to its use in subsequent experiments. For transient transfection, Sertoli cells were isolated from 20-day-old rat testes with a purity of greater than 95% as described previously (11Lui W.Y. Lee W.M. Cheng C.Y. Endocrinology. 2001; 142: 1865-1877Crossref PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar, 16Siu M.K.Y. Wong C.H. Lee W.M. Cheng C.Y. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 25029-25047Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar). Sertoli cells were seeded on Matrigel-coated (diluted 1:5 with F-12/Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium; BD Biosciences) bicameral units (Millicell HA filters, Millipore Corp.), 12-well plates, or cover glass at a density of 1.2 × 106/cm2, 0.5 × 106/cm2, or 0.15 × 106/cm2, respectively, and cultured in F-12/Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium at 35 °C in a humidified atmosphere of 95% air, 5% CO2. Transfection was carried out 2 days after cell isolation, using Effectene Transfection Reagent (Qiagen) with ∼0.3 μg of plasmid DNA/6 × 105 Sertoli cells (plasmid/enhancer (μg/μl) and plasmid/Effectene Reagent (μg/μl) were 1:8 and 1:15, respectively) following the protocols provided by Qiagen with a transfection efficiency of ∼15% (see Table 1). Cells were incubated for an additional 24 h in the transfecting mixture, and fresh F-12/Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium was replaced. In preliminary experiments to optimize transfection efficiency using either calcium phosphate co-precipitation or Effectene reagent (Qiagen) (see Table 1), luciferase reporter plasmid (pGL3-Control and pRL-TK; Promega) was co-transfected into Sertoli cells with various combinations on the amounts of plasmid DNA (∼0.1–3 μg), different cell densities (0.1–1.2 × 106 cells/cm2), and different incubation periods (4 h for calcium phosphate and 24 h for Effectene) to monitor the transfection performance under each condition by assaying the luciferase reporter gene activity. An additional parameter (i.e. different ratios of plasmid DNA to Effectene, ranging between 1:10 and 1:25 were tested) was also assessed for transfection efficiency using Effectene. Transfection efficiency was determined by counting cells (at least 600 cells randomly in four randomly selected fields, ∼150 cells/field, under the microscope) with positive signals using either fluorescence microscopy (for pTracer-CMV2 which contains a green fluorescent protein reporter) or immunohistochemistry staining of TGF-β3 (for pCIneo), because non-TGF-β3-transfected Sertoli cells had relatively weak signals (see Fig. 1B). It should be noted that counting transfected cells with positive signals (e.g. β-galactosidase or green fluorescent protein) is a common approach to determine transfection efficiency (17Xu H. Miller J. Bruce T.L. Nucleic Acids Res. 1992; 20: 6425-6426Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar, 18Kiefer K. Clement J. Garidel P. Peschka-Suss R. Pharmacol. Res. 2004; 21: 1009-1017Crossref Scopus (63) Google Scholar). The integrity of the Sertoli cell TJ permeability barrier and its changes following transient transfection of TGF-β3 versus various controls were estimated by quantifying transepithelial electrical resistance (TER) across the Sertoli cell epithelium when cells were cultured on Matrigel-coated bicameral units as earlier described (11Lui W.Y. Lee W.M. Cheng C.Y. Endocrinology. 2001; 142: 1865-1877Crossref PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar).TABLE 1A summary of experiments conducted in this laboratory for the past 2 years illustrating the transfection efficiency in overexpressing TGF-β3 with different vectors in primary cultures of Sertoli cellsVectoraAll vectors were purchased from Promega except pTracer-CMV2, which was obtained from Invitrogen.

Open table in a new tab Transient Disruption of BTB Induced by Local Administration of TGF-β3; an in Vivo Model for Studying BTB Dynamics—Groups of rats (∼260–300 g body weight, n = 3–4 per time point for each experiment, with a total of four experiments conducted over a period of 2 years) received human recombinant TGF-β3 (catalog number PF073, Calbiochem) at 200 ng of TGF-β3/testis (single dose, with a mean ± S.D. testis weight of about 1.65 ± 0.15 g per testis, n = 12) (regimen 1). Preliminary experiments included administration of 80, 100, and 400 ng of recombinant TGF-β3/testis for 1 or 2 doses (q – 1 week) (n = 2–3 rats per time point), because results obtained from regimen 1 yielded clearly distinguishable and reversible damage at the BTB; results reported herein were representative data of these four experiments. This dosing of 200 ng of recombinant TGF-β3/rat testis that was selected is within the physiological range of TGF-β3 found in the adult rat testis. The physiological level of TGF-β3 in normal rat testes was estimated by immunoblot analysis as follows. Testis protein lysates at 100, 200, and 300 μg of total protein per lane were fractionated along with recombinant TGF-β3 at 1, 3, 5, 8, and 10 ng of protein per lane by SDS-PAGE (all samples in duplicate). The resultant blot was immunostained with an anti-TGF-β3 antibody, and TGF-β3 was visualized using an ECL kit (Amersham Biosciences). Thereafter, the primary and secondary antibodies in this blot were stripped in a stripping buffer (62.5 mm Tris-HCl, pH 6.8, at 22 °C, containing 100 mm 20-mercaptoethanol, 2% SDS (w/v), for 30 min in a reciprocating water bath, 40 rpm, at 55 °C), re-blocked with 6% milk (w/v), and then re-probed with an anti-actin antibody to assess equal protein loading. Protein bands corresponding to TGF-β3 and β-actin were scanned, and data were normalized against β-actin that served as a protein loading control. The amount of TGF-β3 in testis lysates was then interpolated from the resultant standard curve using different amounts of recombinant TGF-β3 (see above) by linear regression, plotting the area under the protein bands against protein levels. This analysis showed that each adult rat testis contained about 1.1 ± 0.2 μg of TGF-β3(n = 4). For in vivo administration, TGF-β3 was resuspended and solubilized in 4 mm HCl containing 0.1% bovine serum albumin (w/v). Just prior to its use, it was diluted in PBS (10 mm sodium phosphate, 0.15 m NaCl, pH 7.4, at 22 °C) at 1:10 to a final concentration of 1 ng/μl, and administered to two different sites (about 100 μl per site, see Fig. 3A, inset, for approximate location in the testis) intratesticularly using a 27-gauge needle as described previously (19Russell L.D. Saxena N.K. Weber J.E. Gamete Res. 1987; 17: 43-56Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar, 20Wiebe J. Kowalik A. Gallardi R. Egeler O. Clubb B. J. Androl. 2000; 21: 625-635PubMed Google Scholar), which is a widely used methodology to assess effects of toxicants in the testis. Vehicle controls referred to rats that received the same buffer containing no TGF-β3. All glassware and plasticware used to handle TGF-β3 were siliconized to minimize protein loss via nonspecific interactions. Rats were terminated at different checkpoints (i.e. time point at which a specific cellular event occurred) as follows: (i) time of TGF-β3 injection (time 0); (ii) time of appearance of BTB damage and germ cell loss (∼4 h to 2 days); (iii) time of BTB recovery (∼2–7 days); (iv) time of germ cell repopulation (∼1–4 weeks); and (v) time of full recovery in which the seminiferous epithelium was indistinguishable from controls (∼4 weeks). Controls included rats receiving the same volume of vehicle or PBS alone administered by the 27-gauge needle as described, or no treatment. As such, the BTB damage and the loss of Sertoli-germ cell adhesion in the testis as reported here following TGF-β3 treatment are not the result of an artifact such as an increase in fluid pressure in the testis. Rats were terminated at specified time points by carbon dioxide asphyxiation, and testes were either frozen in liquid nitrogen or processed for paraffin sectioning. It is noted that the sites of TGF-β3 (or vehicle control) administration remained visible in testes for up to 2 weeks. As such, tissue blocks adjacent to these injection sites were cut (∼0.1–0.2 g, which represented ∼1/10 of the total testis) and were used for lysate preparation in an IP Lysis Buffer (see below). About 3–4 serial cross-sections from the two injection sites from each testis were used for both frozen (for fluorescent microscopy) and paraffin (for hematoxylin and eosin staining) sections. Transient Disruption of Anchoring Junctions in the Seminiferous Epithelium without Compromising BTB Integrity by Treating Rats with Adjudin [1-(2,4-dichlorobenzyl)-1H-indazole-3-carbohydrazide], an in Vivo Model for Studying AJ Dynamics—For rats that received adjudin to induce anchoring junction restructuring without compromising the BTB integrity (for review see Ref. 3Mruk D.D. Cheng C.Y. Endocr. Rev. 2004; 25: 747-806Crossref PubMed Scopus (655) Google Scholar), adult rats (∼270–300 g, body weight) were treated with a single dose of adjudin at 50 mg/kg body weight by gavage as described (21Cheng C.Y. Mruk D. Silvestrini B. Bonanomi M. Wong C.H. Siu M.K.Y. Lee N.P.Y. Lui W.Y. Mo M.Y. Contraception. 2005; 72: 251-261Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar). Adjudin was suspended in 0.25% methylcellulose (w/v with MilliQ water) at a concentration of 20 mg/ml. Rats in groups of ∼3–5 were sacrificed at specified time points following treatment. Testes were immediately removed, frozen in liquid nitrogen, and stored at –80 °C until used. Control animals received vehicle control (i.e. the same volume of 0.25% methylcellulose suspended in water). Elongating and elongate spermatids began to deplete from the seminiferous epithelium by 8 h to 1 day after treatment, and ∼50% of the round, elongating, and elongate spermatids, as well as spermatocytes, were depleted from the seminiferous epithelium in >90% of the tubules by day 4 (21Cheng C.Y. Mruk D. Silvestrini B. Bonanomi M. Wong C.H. Siu M.K.Y. Lee N.P.Y. Lui W.Y. Mo M.Y. Contraception. 2005; 72: 251-261Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar). However, the Sertoli tight junctions at the BTB were shown to be unaffected during extensive anchoring junction restructuring that accompanied germ cell loss from the tubules (3Mruk D.D. Cheng C.Y. Endocr. Rev. 2004; 25: 747-806Crossref PubMed Scopus (655) Google Scholar, 22Lee N.P.Y. Mruk D.D. Conway A.M. Cheng C.Y. J. Androl. 2004; 25: 200-215Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar). Thus, this adjudin model was used to compare changes in the association between activated TβRI upon coupling with TGF-β3 and the adaptors CD2AP and TAB1 when only Sertoli-germ cell anchoring junctions were reversibly disrupted without compromising the BTB integrity versus the TGF-β3 model when both BTB and AJ were disrupted. Fluorescence, Light and Electron Microscopy, and Immunohistochemistry—Fluorescence microscopy using cross-sections of frozen testes (∼7 μm thickness) to co-localize different integral membrane proteins (e.g. N-cadherin, occludin, and JAM-A) and adaptors (e.g. β-catenin, ZO-1) was performed essentially as described earlier (9Xia W. Wong C.H. Lee N.P.Y. Lee W.M. Cheng C.Y. J. Cell. Physiol. 2005; 205: 141-157Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar, 15Xia W. Cheng C.Y. Dev. Biol. 2005; 280: 321-343Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). To visualize Sertoli cells following overexpression with TGF-β3, cells grown on cover glass were fixed in methanol at –20 °C for 10 min, blocked with 10% normal goat serum, and incubated with the corresponding primary antibody pairs (see Table 2). For light microscopy, paraffin sections (∼6 μm thickness) were stained with hematoxylin and eosin. TGF-β3-treated testes were examined, and ∼150 seminiferous tubules were counted per testis in each experimental group by scoring a total of ∼600 randomly selected tubules for each time point from four testes. In brief, cross-sections of testes were placed under an Olympus BX40 microscope using a 10× objective, and 10 randomly selected fields were photographed using an Olympus DP70 and printed using an Epson 890 Inkjet printer. Damaged tubules were then scored and defined by those tubules with elongated spermatids (n >10, except for late stage VIII tubules), round spermatids, and/or spermatocytes (n ≥ 5) found in the tubule lumen as described (15Xia W. Cheng C.Y. Dev. Biol. 2005; 280: 321-343Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). Changes in tubule diameters were also scored (16Siu M.K.Y. Wong C.H. Lee W.M. Cheng C.Y. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 25029-25047Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar). The scoring of tubules was conducted by two separate investigators using coded slides, and results were analyzed and decoded by a third investigator to obtain unbiased composite data. Immunohistochemistry staining of TGF-β3 and TβR1 using frozen sections of testes (∼7 μm in thickness) was performed essentially as described previously (15Xia W. Cheng C.Y. Dev. Biol. 2005; 280: 321-343Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar), and the antibody dilutions that were used for these experiments are shown in Table 2. Controls included sections incubated with normal rabbit IgG instead of the primary antibody against TGF-β3. For all morphology studies, different samples within a treatment group versus controls were processed in a single experimental session using cross-sections of testes (∼3–4 sections per glass slide) so that all sections were treated similarly, including primary and secondary antibodies and/or color development. Electron microscopy was performed at The Rockefeller University Bio-Imaging Facility (12Wong C.H. Mruk D.D. Lui W.Y. Cheng C.Y. J. Cell Sci. 2004; 117: 783-798Crossref PubMed Scopus (204) Google Scholar). In brief, rats treated with 200 ng of TGF-β3 per testis or with vehicle control were terminated on day 2 by CO2 asphyxiation. Testes were removed, incised to release the seminiferous tubules, and fixed in a 0.1 m sodium cacodylate buffer, pH 7.4, at 22 °C, containing 2.5% glutaraldehyde (v/v) for ∼4 h, followed by post-fixation in OsO4 (1%) and staining in 1% uranyl acetate. Tissues were dehydrated in ascending concentrations of ethanol, incubated in propylene oxide, and then infiltrated with EMbed (Electron Microscopy Sciences, Fort Washington, PA). Ultrathin sections (∼80 nm thickness) were cut using a Reichert-Jung Ultracut E microtome (Bannockbum, IL) and post-stained with uranyl acetate/lead.

To determine P. sulfincola thermotolerance and preference, we developed a high-pressure aquarium that mimics in situ thermal gradients and permits P. sulfincola to move within the gradient. These polychaetes were thermotaxic, preferring temperatures of 40° to 50°C. Some individuals remained at 50°C for 7 hours (the duration of the experiment), whereas others endured exposure to 55°C for over 15 minutes, demonstrating that alvinellids prefer high temperatures and are among the most thermotolerant of marine organisms."

The crystal structures of a Vps23:Vps28 core subcomplex and the Vps23:Vps28:Vps37 core were solved at 2.1 and 2.8 Å resolution. Each subunit contains a structurally similar pair of helices that form the core. The N-terminal domain of Vps28 has a hydrophobic binding site on its surface that is conformationally dynamic. The C-terminal domain of Vps28 binds the ESCRT-II complex. The structure shows how ESCRT-I is assembled by a compact core from which the Vps23 UEV domain, the Vps28 C domain, and other domains project to bind their partners."
https://openalex.org/W2012318525,"KLF8 (Kruppel-like factor 8) is a member of the Kruppel transcription factor family that binds CACCC elements in DNA and activates or represses their target genes in a context-dependent manner. Here we present sumoylation as a novel mechanism that regulates KLF8 post-translationally. We found that KLF8 can be covalently modified by small ubiqitin-like modifier (SUMO)-1, SUMO-2, and SUMO-3 in vivo. We showed that KLF8 interacted with the PIAS family of SUMO E3 ligases PIAS1, PIASy, and PIASxα but not with E2 SUMO-conjugating enzyme Ubc9. Furthermore, we demonstrated that the E2 and E3 ligases enhanced the sumoylation of KLF8. In addition, site-directed mutagenesis identified lysine 67 as the major sumoylation site on KLF8. Lysine 67 to arginine mutation strongly enhanced activity of KLF8 as a repressor or activator to its physiological target promoters and as an inducer of the G1 cell cycle progression. Taken together, our results demonstrated that sumoylation of KLF8 negatively regulates its transcriptional activity and cellular functions."

Activation of adenylyl cyclase (AC, i.e. increases in cAMP) negatively regulates such transformation. Caveolae and their resident protein caveolins scaffold signaling molecules, including AC isoforms, whereas phosphorylated caveolin-1 (phospho-cav-1) may localize at FA. Here, we used adult rat cardiac fibroblasts to examine distribution and expression of AC, phospho-cav-1, and FA proteins to define mechanisms that link increases in cAMP to caveolin-1 phosphorylation, actin/FA assembly, and fibroblast-myofibroblast transformation. Sucrose density gradient centrifugation, immunoblot, and immunohistochemical analysis revealed that, unlike cav-1, phospho-cav-1 enriches in membrane fractions that express FA proteins and localize at the ends of actin stress fibers. We detected AC in both cav-1 and phospho-cav-1 immunoprecipitates, but FA kinase (FAK), phospho-FAK (FAK Tyr-397), paxillin, and vinculin were detected only in phospho-cav-1 immunoprecipitates. Treatment with the AC activator forskolin or a cAMP analog increased cav-1 phosphorylation but decreased FAK Tyr-397 phosphorylation in a cAMP-dependent protein kinase-dependent manner. These events preceded actin cytoskeletal disruption, an effect that was blocked by small interfering RNA knock-down of cav-1. Inhibition of protein tyrosine phosphatase 1B abrogated cAMP-mediated disruption of actin cytoskeleton, cav-1 phosphorylation, and FAK Tyr-397 dephosphorylation. The data thus define a novel organization of signaling molecules that regulate fibroblasts: scaffolding of AC by phospho-cav-1 at FA sites in a caveolae-free microdomain along with components that mediate inhibition of actin/FA assembly and fibroblast-myofibroblast transformation via increases in cAMP.

Recent evidence suggests that FA serve as organizing centers for regulatory and structural proteins so as to facilitate rapid, precise control of cell proliferation, differentiation, and function (6Wozniak M.A. Modzelewska K.

Among these are anchoring proteins, such as vinculin, paxillin, talin, and α-actinin, which link the actin cytoskeleton to transmembrane integrin receptors at FA (8Dugina V. Fontao L. Chaponnier C.

Caveolae are cholesterol- and sphingolipid-rich, flask-like invaginations of the plasma membrane that serve as organizing centers for certain transporters, receptors, and post-receptor signaling components, facilitating rapid, coordinated regulation of cell function (13Pike L.J.

In addition to their role as scaffolding proteins, cav-1 and cav-2 are substrates for phosphorylation by tyrosine kinases such as Src family kinase (18Lee H. Volonte D. Galbiati F. Iyengar P.

Okumura S. Lee M.C. Sadoshima J. Ishikawa Y. Am. J. Physiol. 2004; 286: H1845-H1852Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). In contrast, phosphorylated cav-1 (phospho-cav-1) localizes in close proximity to FA (21Volonte D. Galbiati F. Pestell R.G. Lisanti M.P. J. Biol.

The functional activity of phospho-cav-1 is poorly understood, but its localization near FA and associated microfilaments suggests a role in the regulation of actin and FA dynamics and potentially in the modulation of fibroblast-myofibroblast transformation. Adenylyl cyclases (AC) are membrane-bound proteins that catalyze conversion of ATP to cAMP, a ubiquitous second messenger that has numerous effects on cell function and morphology, primarily (albeit not exclusively (25Enserink J.M. Christensen A.E. de Rooij J. van Triest M. Schwede F. Genieser H.G. Doskeland S.O. Blank J.L. Bos J.L. Nat. Cell Biol. 2002; 4: 901-906Crossref PubMed Scopus (618) Google Scholar)) through the activation of the cAMP-dependent protein kinase, PKA. One such effect is to blunt FAK phosphorylation and to induce disassembly of actin stress fibers and FA (26Bulin C. Albrecht U. Bode J.G. Weber A.A. Schror K. Levkau B. Fischer J.W. Arterioscler. Thromb. Vasc. Biol. 2005; 25: 84-89Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). Other studies implicate cAMP-promoted PKA activation in the phosphorylation of cav-1 as a prelude to cell rounding (27Colonna C. Podesta E.J. Exp. Cell Res. 2005; 304: 432-442Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). We recently provided evidence that AC activation or cAMP analogs that activate PKA inhibit cardiac myofibroblast formation via effects on α-smooth muscle actin formation (28Swaney J.S. Roth D.M. Olson E.R. Naugle J.E. Meszaros J.G. Insel P.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2005; 102: 437-442Crossref PubMed Scopus (189) Google Scholar). To date, however, no evidence has linked AC and phosphocav-1 in terms of effects on cell morphology or function. Here, we set out to test such a linkage. We find that in adult rat cardiac fibroblasts (CF): 1) phospho-cav-1 colocalizes with AC at FA at plasma membrane sites that are independent of caveolae or lipid rafts; 2) stimulation of AC or incubation with a cAMP analog increases phosphorylation of cav-1 but decreases FAK Tyr-397 phosphorylation in parallel with a disruption of basal and transforming growth factor β-stimulated actin and FA assembly; and 3) protein tyrosine phosphatase (PTP) inhibition abolishes the effects of increased cAMP on cell morphology. The data thus provide unique evidence that phospho-cav-1-mediated scaffolding of AC at FA sites, independent of caveolae, facilitates rapid dysregulation of actin and FA assembly, thereby leading to inhibition of fibroblast-myofibroblast transformation.

The Src kinase inhibitor (4-amino-5-(4-chlorophenyl)-7-(t-butyl)pyrazolo(3,4-d)pyrimidine (PP2)), cAMP analog (8-CPT-cAMP), PKA inhibitor (Rp-cAMPs, adenosine 3′,5′-cyclic phosphorothiolate-Rp), and PTP1B inhibitor (3-(3,5-dibromo-4-hydroxy-benzoyl)-2-ethyl-benzofuran-6-sulfonicacid-(4-(thiazol-2-ylsulfamyl)-phenyl)-amide) were purchased from Calbiochem. All other drugs and reagents were obtained from Sigma. Isolation and Culture of Adult Rat CF—CF were isolated from adult Sprague-Dawley rats (250–300 g, male) and cultured as described previously (28Swaney J.S. Roth D.M. Olson E.R. Naugle J.E.

CF from two 10-cm plates were washed twice in ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline and scraped in 1 ml of 150 mm Na2CO3 (pH 11.0) containing 1 mm EDTA, protease inhibitor mixture (Sigma), and phosphatase inhibitor mixture (Calbiochem). Cell lysates were sonicated on ice with three cycles of 20-s bursts. Approximately 1 ml of homogenate was mixed with 1 ml of 80% sucrose in 25 mm MES, 150 mm NaCl (MBS, pH 6.5) to form 40% sucrose and loaded at the bottom of an ultracentrifuge tube. Discontinuous sucrose gradients (generated by layering 6 ml of 35% sucrose in MBS followed by 4 ml of 5% sucrose) were centrifuged at 175,000 × g using a SW41Ti rotor (Beckman Instruments) for 3 h at 4°C. Samples were removed in 1-ml aliquots to form 12 fractions. Immunoprecipitation, Immunohistochemical, and Immunoblot Analysis of CF—Immunoprecipitations were performed using either protein A-agarose or protein G-agarose (Roche Applied Science). CF from a 10-cm plate were washed twice in ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline and scraped in 1 ml of lysis buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, 150 mm NaCl, 1% Igepal) containing protease inhibitor mixture (Sigma) and phosphatase inhibitor mixture (Calbiochem). Lysates were precleared with protein-agarose for 1–3 h at 4 °C, incubated with primary antibody for 1–3 h, immunoprecipitated with protein-agarose overnight at 4 °C, and centrifuged at 13,000 × g for 5 min. Protein-agarose pellets were washed once in lysis buffer followed by subsequent washes in wash buffer 2 (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 500 mm NaCl, 0.2% Igepal CA-630) and wash buffer 3 (10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 0.2% Igepal CA-630). Immunoblot and immunohistochemical (with image deconvolution) analyses were conducted as described (28Swaney J.S. Roth D.M. Olson E.R. Naugle J.E. Meszaros J.G. Insel P.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.

RNA Interference—The expression of PTP1B and cav-1 was suppressed in fibroblasts by using targeted siRNA (Ambion). The specific PTP1B siRNA sequences were as follows: siRNA 1, sense, 5′-GGAAAUGCCAAAUACUCUUtt-3′, antisense, 5′-AAGAGUAUUUGGCAUUUCCtc-3′; siRNA 2, sense, 5′-GCUUGAUAAAAAUGGAGGAtt-3′, antisense, 5′-UCCUCCAUUUUUAUCAAGCtg-3′; siRNA 3, sense, 5′-GCCAGUGACUUCCCAUGCAtt-3′, antisense, 5′-UGCAUGGGAAGUCACUGGCtt-3′.

Cells were treated with 1.33 μg of siRNA (three separate constructs) using Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen) as the transfection reagent for 24 h. Transfection reagent and negative siRNA (scrambled sequence of similar length, Ambion) served as controls. Cells were co-transfected with Block-iT fluorescent oligomer (Invitrogen) to determine siRNA-positive cells. Functional knockdown of gene was assessed by attenuation of effect of forskolin on cell morphology, as determined by immunohistochemistry. Data Analysis—Statistical comparisons and graphical representation were performed using GraphPad Prism 3.0 (GraphPad Software). Statistical significance was set at p < 0.05. Phospho-cav-1 Localizes at FA Sites, Independent of Caveolae, in Adult Rat CF—Using immunohistochemistry and immunoblot analysis, we examined the localization of cav-1 and phospho-cav-1 in adult rat CF. Although cav-1 distributes throughout the plasma membrane, phospho-cav-1 localized primarily at FA sites that were independent of caveolae (Fig. 1A), as identified by cav-1 staining. Quantitation revealed that 21.1 ± 4.2% of total cav-1 is phosphorylated in CF. Phospho-cav-1 localized at the end of actin microfilaments in a manner identical to FAK (Fig. 1A, upper panels) and the FA markers paxillin and vinculin (data not shown), whereas cav-1 did not localize with either FAK or paxillin at FA sites (Fig. 1A, bottom middle and right panels). Phospho-cav-1 exhibited a high degree of colocalization with tyrosine phosphorylated FAK (FAK Tyr-397) (Fig. 1A, bottom left), which is generated by autophosphorylation at FAK following integrin engagement, making FAK Tyr-397 a highly specific FA marker (9Parsons J.T. J. Cell Sci. 2003; 116: 1409-1416Crossref PubMed Scopus (1150) Google Scholar). To confirm interaction between phospho-cav-1 and FA proteins, we conducted pull-down assays using cav-1 and phospho-cav-1 antibodies and probed immunoprecipitates for expression of FAK, FAK Tyr-397, paxillin, and vinculin (Fig. 1B). FA proteins were detected almost exclusively in phospho-cav-1 immunoprecipitates with little or no detection in cav-1 immunoprecipitates. These findings imply that phospho-cav-1, unlike cav-1, localizes at FA sites where it interacts with multiple FA proteins. We used sucrose density gradient fractionation to assess the distribution of cav-1 and phospho-cav-1 in buoyant/lipid rafts (fractions 4–5) versus “heavy” membrane fractions (fractions 10–12). We found (Fig. 1C) that cav-1 and phospho-cav-1 were present in both buoyant and heavy membrane fractions but that expression of phospho-cav-1 was much greater in the heavy fractions, consistent with a non-caveolar distribution. Similar findings were observed using detergent-based cell fractionation methods (data not shown). FAK, FAK Tyr-397, paxillin, and vinculin were only detected in the heavy cellular fractions (Fig. 1D). These findings demonstrate that phospho-cav-1 is localized primarily at FA sites independent of caveolae/buoyant lipid rafts. AC5/6 Localizes with cav-1 throughout the Cell Membrane and with Phospho-cav-1 at FA Sites—AC5/6 is predominantly detected in buoyant/caveolar membrane fractions, but a portion of AC5/6 localizes in heavy/non-caveolar membrane fractions in cardiac cells (31Ostrom R.S. Naugle J.E. Hase M. Gregorian C. Swaney J.S. Insel P.A. Brunton L.L. Meszaros J.G. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 24461-24468Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar, 32Head B.P.

Immunohistochemical analysis and quantification of AC5/6 and phospho-cav-1 staining of CF revealed that, in addition to being distributed with cav-1 throughout the plasma membrane, 17 ± 4% of AC 5/6 colocalizes with phospho-cav-1 and 57 ± 12% of phospho-cav-1 colocalizes with AC 5/6 at FA sites (Fig. 2A). We verified this interaction by co-immunoprecipitation using AC 5/6 and phospho-cav-1 antibodies (Fig. 2B). AC5/6 enriches in the buoyant/caveolar fraction (the buoyant fraction contains only 5% of the protein found in the heavy fraction) but is also found in heavy fractions with phospho-cav-1 (Fig. 2C). Thus, a portion of AC5/6 colocalizes with and may be scaffolded by phospho-cav-1 at FA sites. AC Activation or a cAMP Analog Stimulates cav-1 Phosphorylation in a Src Kinase- and PKA-dependent Manner—The addition of forskolin (10 μm) or 8-CPT-cAMP (100 μm) induced time-dependent increases in cav-1 phosphorylation (Fig. 3A). Pretreatment of CF for 30 min with a Src kinase inhibitor (PP2; 10 μm) or a PKA inhibitor (Rp-cAMPs; 100 μm) abolished the forskolin-stimulated increase in phospho-cav-1 (Fig. 3B), demonstrating that cAMP acts in both a Src kinase- and a PKA-dependent manner to increase phospho-cav-1. Consistent with previous reports (33Schmitt J.M. Stork P.J. Mol. Cell. 2002; 9: 85-94Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (214) Google Scholar), forskolin also promoted rapid (5 min) activation of Src (Fig. 3C), as indicated by increased phosphorylation of Src at tyrosine 416 (Tyr-416). The stimulation of phospho-cav-1 by AC/cAMP may be facilitated by their colocalization at FA sites. cAMP/PKA-mediated cav-1 Phosphorylation Precedes Disruption of Actin Cytoskeleton—Based on AC/cAMP-mediated inhibition of myofibroblast transformation (28Swaney J.S. Roth D.M. Olson E.R. Naugle J.E. Meszaros J.G. Insel P.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2005; 102: 437-442Crossref PubMed Scopus (189) Google Scholar), we hypothesized that scaffolding of AC 5/6 by phospho-cav-1 at FA sites may facilitate actin cytoskeleton disassembly. Using immunohistochemistry, we examined the kinetics of cav-1 phosphorylation and actin reorganization following stimulation of CF with forskolin (10 μm) or H2O2 (5 mm), an agent that promotes cav-1 phosphorylation (21Volonte D. Galbiati F. Pestell R.G. Lisanti M.P. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 8094-8103Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (213) Google Scholar) (Fig. 4A). Within 5 min of forskolin treatment, phospho-cav-1 intensity was dramatically increased and remained elevated for 30 min. By 30 min, the actin cytoskeleton began to break down, undergoing complete disruption after 60 min. H2O2 treatment resulted in a similar, rapid (5 min) increase in cav-1 phosphorylation that was followed by disintegration of the actin cytoskeleton (60 min), further demonstrating the parallel between enhanced cav-1 phosphorylation and disruption of the actin cytoskeleton. Similar to previous findings (34Chen D.B. Li S.M. Qian X.X. Moon C. Zheng J. Biol. Reprod. 2005; 73: 761-772Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar), the disruption of the actin cytoskeleton between 30 and 60 min coincided with a reduction in phospho-cav-1 intensity and a redistribution of phospho-cav-1 toward the interior of the cell.FIGURE 4cAMP/PKA-stimulated cav-1 phosphorylation precedes disruption of the actin cytoskeleton. Immunohistochemistry was performed using adult rat CF grown for 48 h in serum-free media and then stimulated with serum-free media alone (control) or for 5, 15, 30, and 60 min with forskolin (10 μm) or H202 (5 mm)(A). B, CF were incubated for 24 h with media alone (control), cav-1 siRNA, or a negative (scrambled siRNA) control and then treated with or without forskolin (1 μm) for 60 min. CF were stained for cav-1 (green), F-actin (phalloidin, red), and DNA (DAPI, blue). Fluorescence intensity at all time points was normalized relative to basal to account for increased cav-1 phosphorylation following stimulation.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) To verify the role of phospho-cav-1 in AC/cAMP-mediated disruption of actin cytoskeleton, we used siRNA to knock-down cav-1 expression in CF (Fig. 4B). Using immunohistochemistry, we observed a decrease in cav-1 staining in siRNA-treated cells that correlated with a reduced ability of forskolin (1 μm) to disrupt the actin cytoskeleton. In contrast, negative (scrambled) siRNA-treated cells exhibited a high degree of cav-1 staining and complete disintegration of the actin cytoskeleton in response to forskolin treatment. A submaximal (1 μm) concentration of forskolin was used to avoid any phospho-cav-1-independent effects on microfilament assembly as a result of cAMP-promoted decrease in Rho-activity (35Laudanna C. Campbell J.J. Butcher E.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 24141-24144Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (185) Google Scholar). Combined, these data demonstrate the involvement of phospho-cav-1 in AC/cAMP-mediated regulation of actin cytoskeletal dynamics. cAMP/PKA-mediated Disruption of Actin Cytoskeleton and FA Assembly Involves Decreased FAK Activation—Increased FAK Tyr-397 phosphorylation is implicated in fibroblast-myofibroblast transformation (11Thannickal V.J. Lee D.Y. White E.S. Cui Z. Larios J.M. Chacon R. Horowitz J.C. Day R.M. Thomas P.E. J. Biol.

Dermatol. 2005; 124: 886-892Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar); thus, we investigated whether scaffolding of AC 5/6 at FA sites affects FAK phosphorylation in CF. The addition of forskolin (10 μm) or 8-CPT-cAMP (100 μm) induced time-dependent decreases in FAK Tyr-397 phosphorylation (Fig. 5A), which depended upon PKA, as indicated by blockade with Rp-cAMPs (100 μm; Fig. 5B). Forskolin treatment disrupted transforming growth factor β (10 ng/ml)-stimulated assembly of actin stress fibers and FA complexes (Fig. 5C). The inhibitory effects of cAMP/PKA on fibroblast-myofibroblast transformation may thus be a consequence of dephosphorylation of FAK. cAMP-mediated cav-1 Phosphorylation and FAK Dephosphorylation Are Abrogated by a Protein Tyrosine Phosphatase 1B (PTP1B) Inhibitor—Because both cav-1 and FAK are phosphorylated on tyrosine residues, we examined the role of PTP activity in cAMP-mediated cav-1 phosphorylation and FAK dephosphorylation by treating CF with forskolin in the presence of a PTP1B inhibitor. Forskolin induced a time-dependent increase in PTP1B activation (Fig. 6A). Inhibition of PTP1B reduced the ability of forskolin to stimulate cav-1 phosphorylation (Fig. 6B) and dephosphorylate FAK Tyr-397 (Fig. 6C). Together, these data demonstrate a role for PTP1B in the cAMP-mediated regulation of cav-1 phosphorylation and FAK Tyr-397 dephosphorylation, effects that appear to be involved in the disruption of cytoskeletal dynamics. cAMP-mediated Cytoskeleton Disruption Is Dependent upon PTP1B—To examine the role of PTPs in the AC/cAMP-mediated effects on cell morphology, we treated CF with forskolin in the presence of vanadate, a nonspecific PTP inhibitor, or a PTP1B-selective inhibitor (Fig. 7A). PTP inhibition with vanadate dose-dependently abolished the ability of forskolin to disrupt actin and FA assembly. Selective inhibition of PTP1B produced identical effects. Moreover, knock-down of PTP1B using siRNA abolished the ability of forskolin to promote disassembly of actin and FA (Fig. 7B). Together, these results demonstrate that PTP1B is required for cAMP-mediated breakdown of the actin cytoskeleton and FA. First identified in its phosphorylated form in v-Src transformed cells (36Glenney Jr., J.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 20163-20166Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), cav-1 has well characterized effects on cell morphology and disease (14Hnasko R. Lisanti M.P. Mol. Interventions. 2003; 3: 445-464Crossref PubMed Scopus (172) Google Scholar, 37Williams T.M. Lisanti M.P. Am. J. Physiol. 2005; 288: C494-C506Crossref PubMed Scopus (460) Google Scholar) but little is known regarding the biological role of phospho-cav-1. Cav-1 is phosphorylated on tyrosine 14 in response to cellular stress, hormone, and growth factor stimulation, and when phosphorylated, serves as a docking site for SH2 domain-containing proteins such as Grb7 (18Lee H. Volonte D. Galbiati F. Iyengar P. Lublin D.M. Bregman D.B. Wilson M.T. Campos-Gonzalez R. Bouzahzah B. Pestell R.G. Scherer P.E. Lisanti M.P. Mol. Endocrinol. 2000; 14: 1750-1775Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The SH2 domain of Grb7 interacts with FAK through tyrosine 397 with subsequent effects on cell migration (38Han D.C. Guan J.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 24425-24430Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (202) Google Scholar). Based on its apparent localization near FA sites, phospho-cav-1 may be involved in stabilization of the actin cytoskeleton (39Cao H. Sanguinetti A.R. Mastick C.C. Exp. Cell Res. 2004; 294: 159-171Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). Phospho-cav-1 could therefore provide an anchoring site for proteins that control cell morphology and function via regulation of actin cytoskeleton dynamics. We hypothesized that localization of phospho-cav-1 near FA sites, combined with the ability of cav-1 to scaffold AC, would provide a favorable organization of structural proteins and catalytic molecules to facilitate regulation of CF morphology and function by increased cAMP. We demonstrate that phospho-cav-1 localizes at FA sites, independent of membrane caveolae, where it interacts with the FA proteins FAK, paxillin, and vinculin. At these sites, phospho-cav-1 scaffolds AC, which, when activated, disrupts actin and FA assembly via dephosphorylation of the FA regulatory molecule FAK, with concomitant stimulation of cav-1 phosphorylation. Thus, cAMP-stimulated cav-1 phosphorylation provides a positive feedback mechanism for increased scaffolding of AC (and perhaps other regulatory proteins) by phospho-cav-1 at FA sites during regulation of actin and FA dynamics (Fig. 8). AC/cAMP promotes dephosphorylation of FAK and, in parallel, phosphorylation of cav-1 in CF. The fact that both FAK and cav-1 undergo PKA-dependent changes in tyrosine phosphorylation led us to hypothesize a regulation of protein tyrosine PTP activity by cAMP. Nonspecific PTP inhibitors attenuate prostaglandin-mediated FAK dephosphorylation and actin disruption (26Bulin C. Albrecht U. Bode J.G. Weber A.A. Schror K. Levkau B. Fischer J.W. Arterioscler. Thromb. Vasc. Biol. 2005; 25: 84-89Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). Phosphotyrosine phosphatase PTP1B exerts similar effects on actin cytoskeleton and FAK phosphorylation (40Pathre P. Arregui C. Wampler T. Kue I. Leung T.C. Lilien J. Balsamo J. J. Neurosci. Res. 2001; 63: 143-150Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar, 41Liu F. Sells M.A. Chernoff J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 250-259Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). PTP1B also colocalizes with cav-1 (42Lee H. Xie L. Luo Y. Lee S.Y. Lawrence D.S. Wang X.B. Sotgia F. Lisanti M.P. Zhang Z.Y. Biochemistry. 2006; 45: 234-240Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar) and can promote the activity of Src kinase via dephosphorylation of c-Src tyrosine 529, the Src autoinhibitory site (43Arias-Salgado E.G. Haj F. Dubois C. Moran B. Kasirer-Friede A. Furie B.C. Furie B. Neel B.G. Shattil S.J. J. Cell Biol. 2005; 170: 837-845Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar). Active Src is able to promote cav-1 phosphorylation (18Lee H. Volonte D. Galbiati F. Iyengar P. Lublin D.M. Bregman D.B. Wilson M.T. Campos-Gonzalez R. Bouzahzah B. Pestell R.G. Scherer P.E.

Since cAMP can stimulate PTP1B (44Tao J. Malbon C.C. Wang H.Y. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 29520-29525Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar) and Src activity (33Schmitt J.M. Stork P.J. Mol. Cell. 2002; 9: 85-94Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (214) Google Scholar), we propose that PTP1B is the downstream mediator for the cAMP/PKA-mediated effects on phospho-cav-1, FAK, and actin cytoskeleton in adult rat CF. Consistent with this hypothesis, inhibition of PTP1B (45Wiesmann C. Barr K.J. Kung J. Zhu J. Erlanson D.A. Shen W. Fahr B.J. Zhong M. Taylor L. Randal M. McDowell R.S. Hansen S.K. Nat. Struct. Mol.

The current findings thus demonstrate a novel regulatory pathway whereby scaffolding and activation of AC at FA sites blocks FAK activation, leading to rapid disruption of actin and FA assembly, events that depend upon PTP1B. cAMP/PKA-stimulated phosphorylation of cav-1 appears to potentiate these effects by positive feedback on the increased scaffolding of AC by phospho-cav-1 at FA sites. Few successful strategies currently exist for inhibiting deleterious ECM production that is associated with fibrotic disorders (Lotersztajn et al. (47Lotersztajn S. Julien B. Teixeira-Clerc F. Grenard P. Mallat A. Annu. Rev. Pharmacol. Toxicol. 2005; 45: 605-628Crossref PubMed Scopus (284) Google Scholar); Weber and co-workers (48Sun Y. Zhang J. Lu L. Bedigian M.P. Robinson A.D. Weber K.T.

The results here provide new mechanistic information regarding the ability of cAMP/PKA to control downstream catalytic molecules in a manner that inhibits fibroblast-myofibroblast transformation, thereby suggesting potential targets to attenuate maladaptive connective tissue remodeling (organ fibrosis) via cAMP/PKA-mediated regulation of actin and FA regulatory proteins at FA."

Recombinant capsid-like core particles are used as effective carriers of foreign T and B cell epitopes and as delivery vehicles for oligonucleotides. The core monomer contains an arginine-rich C terminus that directs core particle attachment to cells via membrane heparan sulfate proteoglycans. Here we investigated the mechanism of recombinant core particle uptake and its intracellular fate following heparan sulfate binding. We found that the core particles are internalized in an energy-dependent manner. Core particle uptake is inhibited by chlorpromazine and by cytosol acidification known to block clathrin-mediated endocytosis but not by nystatin, which blocks lipid raft endocytosis. Particle uptake is abolished by expression of dominant negative forms of eps15 and Rab5, adaptors involved in clathrin-mediated endocytosis and early endosome transport, respectively. Endocytosed particles are transported to lysosomes where the core monomer is endoproteolytically cleaved into its distinct domains.

The viral capsid also termed the core particle is a 30-nm diameter icosahedral structure assembling from 180 or 240 virally encoded core antigen (HBcAg) monomers (1Crowther R.A. Kiselev N.A. Bottcher B. Berriman J.A. Borisova G.P. Ose V. Pumpens P. Cell. 1994; 77: 943-950Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (426) Google Scholar). HBcAg is a 185-amino acid protein that harbors two distinct domains, namely an assembly domain (residues 1–144) that drives particle formation and an arginine-rich domain (residues 150–185) that binds nucleic acids (2Birnbaum F. Nassal M. J. Virol. 1990; 64: 3319-3330Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The particle lattice is fenestrated by repetitive 1.5-nm diameter channels that allow partial exposure of the arginine-rich domains of HBcAg on the shell surface (3Wynne S.A. Crowther R.A. Leslie A.G. Mol. Cell. 1999; 3: 771-780Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (530) Google Scholar). The core particle is extremely immunogenic, eliciting strong and long-lasting B and T cell immune responses during infection (4Pumpens P. Grens E. Intervirology. 2001; 44: 98-114Crossref PubMed Scopus (232) Google Scholar). T cell responses provoked by core particles are essential for keeping HBV replication under control (5Hollinger F.B. Liang T.J. Fields Virology. 2001; (Lippincott Raven Publishers, Philadelphia): 2971-3036Google Scholar). When expressed in various heterologous systems, HBcAg efficiently self-assembles into capsid-like core particles indistinguishable from native capsid shells (6Miyanohara A. Imamura T. Araki M. Sugawara K. Ohtomo N. Matsubara K. J. Virol. 1986; 59: 176-180Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 7Pasek M. Goto T. Gilbert W. Zink B. Schaller H. MacKay P. Leadbetter G. Murray K.

Particle assembly tolerates fusion of foreign proteins to the HBcAg monomer, making it an attractive carrier of B and T cell epitopes for vaccination purposes (4Pumpens P. Grens E. Intervirology. 2001; 44: 98-114Crossref PubMed Scopus (232) Google Scholar). Consistently, T cell epitopes carried by capsid-like particles are efficiently presented on class I and class II MHC molecules of antigen-presenting cells (APCs) (9Storni T. Bachmann M.F. J. Immunol. 2004; 172: 6129-6135Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). Also, the capacity of the arginine-rich domain of HBcAg to bind nucleic acids has been utilized by us and by others to incorporate oligodeoxynucleotides (ODN) into the lumen of recombinant core particles (10Cooper A. Shaul Y. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2005; 327: 1094-1099Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar, 11Storni T. Ruedl C. Schwarz K. Schwendener R.A. Renner W.A. Bachmann M.F. J.

Commun. 2005; 327: 1094-1099Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). Furthermore, ODN encapsulated in core particles or conjugated to an arginine-rich peptide derived from the C terminus of HBcAg exert enhanced immunostimulatory effects in vivo, and these effects have been suggested to result from their efficient endosomal delivery and activation of toll-like receptor 9 (TLR9) signaling (11Storni T.

These findings led researchers to propose that the core particles are efficiently endocytosed by cells, yet this possibility and the underlying mechanism have not been investigated. Recently we and others have shown that capsid-like core particles efficiently bind a wide variety of cell types including macrophages and B cells (14Cooper A. Tal G. Lider O. Shaul Y. J. Immunol. 2005; 175: 3165-3176Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar, 15Vanlandschoot P. Van Houtte F. Serruys B. Leroux-Roels G. J. Gen. Virol. 2005; 86: 75-84Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). Particle attachment requires the arginine-rich domain of HBcAg and sulfated heparan sulfate proteoglycans on the target cell membrane (14Cooper A. Tal G. Lider O. Shaul Y. J.

Here we investigated core particle cell entry following heparan sulfate binding and the underlying mechanism. We found that the particles are internalized via clathrin-mediated endocytosis involving Eps15 and Rab5. Endocytosed particles are trafficked to lysosomes, where HBcAg is endoproteolytically cleaved into its distinct domains by cathepsin B and disassembles. These findings illuminate the molecular mechanism underlying core particle-mediated delivery of macromolecules for potentially therapeutic purposes and may have implications for HBcAg immunogenicity.

All experiments using recombinant full-length (HBc) core particles were reproducible using bacterially prepared HBV capsids (subtype ayw) generously provided by Prof. Paul Pumpens (Biomedical Research and Study Center, University of Latvia, Riga, Latvia). Antibodies—Monoclonal anti-β-tubulin was from Sigma. Polyclonal rabbit antibodies against HBcAg (pac74) were generated by repeated injections with bacterially expressed, purified core protein. The monoclonal mouse anti-HBcAg antibody (mac22) was generated by injection of bacterially expressed, purified HBcAg capsids, followed by selection of hybridoma-secreting anti-core antibodies. The epitope recognized by mac22 lies between residues 110–130 of HBcAg. 3I. Sominskaya, personal communication. Cell Culture—HepG2 and COS-1 cells were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (Invitrogen) supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum and antibiotics (100 units/ml penicillin and 100 mg/ml streptomycin). For immunohistochemistry analyses, the cells were seeded on 13 mm coverslips in 24-well plates (Nunc) 1 day before the experiment and incubated with the indicated concentrations of HBc core particles. Cytosol Acidification—Inhibition of clathrin-coated pit endocytosis by cytosol acidification was performed as previously described (18Sandvig K. Olsnes S. Petersen O.W. van Deurs B. J. Cell Biol. 1987; 105: 679-689Crossref PubMed Scopus (252) Google Scholar). Briefly, the cells were pre-treated for 30 min with Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 10 mm HEPES, pH 7.4 and 30 mm NH4Cl before addition of particles in Na+-free buffer (140 mm KCl, 2 mm CaCl2, 1 mm MgCl2, 1 mm amiloride, and 10 mm HEPES, pH 7.5) for 2 h. The cells were processed for immunofluorescent analysis as described below. Transfections—For transfection experiments, HepG2 and COS-1 cells were seeded at 60% confluency on 13 mm coverslips in 24-well plates and transfected with 0.5 μg of DNA per well using the calcium phosphate method. 24 h after transfection the cells were incubated with HBc particles for the indicated times. Immunostaining—Nuclei were stained with Hoechst 33342 (Molecular Probes) by brief incubation prior to cell fixation. The cells were extensively washed with normal medium or medium containing heparin (0.3 mg/ml) and then with PBS prior to fixation with 4% paraformaldehyde for 30 min at room temperature. Fixed cells were permeabilized with 0.5% Triton X-100 in PBS for 25 min at room temperature, washed with PBS containing 0.2% Tween 20 (PBS/T), and blocked with fetal calf serum containing 10% (v/v) skim milk and 0.2% (v/v) Tween 20 for 45 min. Cells were then incubated with polyclonal rabbit anti-HBcAg antibodies (diluted 1:75) in PBS/T containing 10% skim milk for 1 h, washed six times for 5 min with PBS/T and incubated with Rhodamine red X-conjugated anti-rabbit antibodies (Jackson Immunoresearch Laboratories) for 40 min. Finally, the cells were washed six times as above, and the coverslips were mounted in Aqua-polymount (Polysciences). Microscopic images were obtained using a Bio-Rad MRC-1024 confocal system, utilizing an argon-krypton mixed gas laser and mounted on a Zeiss Axiovert microscope. Representative fields of one of three experiments with similar results are shown. In each experiment the presented images were acquired using identical laser intensities. Immunoblotting—Total cell extracts made in radioimmune precipitation assay lysis buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8, 150 mm NaCl, 1% Nonidet P-40 (v/v), 0.5% AB-deoxycholate (v/v), 0.1% SDS (v/v), 1 mm dithiothreitol, and a protease inhibitors mixture (Sigma)) were subjected to SDS-PAGE followed by Western blot analysis according to standard protocols. For detection of particles under native conditions, samples from core particle preparations or cell extracts made by three cycles of freezing and thawing in PBS containing protease inhibitors were subjected to electrophoresis through 1% agarose gel in TAE (40 mm Tris acetate, 1 mm EDTA). The proteins were either stained with GelCode (Pierce) or capillary-transferred to a nitrocellulose membrane followed by Western blot analysis according to standard protocols. HBc Core Particles Are Internalized via Clathrin-mediated Endocytosis—In this study we used COS-1 and HepG2 cells to study HBV core particle entry into cells and the possible underlying mechanism. Incubation of cells with full-length HBc core particles followed by cell fixation and immunofluorescent microscopy visualization revealed HBcAg-positive staining on the surface and possibly in the cytoplasm of cells but not in the cell nucleus (Fig. 1A). HBcAg-positive staining was observed for all cells examined in at least 10 different optical fields (data not shown), demonstrating efficient particle cell attachment. No signal was detected in mock-treated cells, demonstrating the specificity of the anti-HBcAg antibodies used for the immunofluorescent analysis (data not shown). Particle cell attachment was abolished when soluble heparin was included during the incubation period (Fig. 1B), in accordance with the fact that particle binding to cells is mediated by heparan sulfate (14Cooper A. Tal G. Lider O. Shaul Y. J. Immunol. 2005; 175: 3165-3176Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar, 15Vanlandschoot P. Van Houtte F. Serruys B. Leroux-Roels G. J. Gen. Virol. 2005; 86: 75-84Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). Interestingly, when the cells were incubated with particles in the absence of heparin but washed with medium containing heparin to remove externally bound particles at the end of the incubation period, punctate HBcAg-positive staining was observed reminiscent of endosomal or lysosomal vesicles (Fig. 1C). This result suggested that the particles become endocytosed. To test this possibility further, the incubations were preformed in the presence of energy inhibitors (azide and 2-deoxy-d-glucose) that block endocytosis. Depletion of cellular energy had no substantial effect on particle binding to cells but blocked particle uptake (Fig. 1, D and E, respectively). Incubating the cells at 4 °C had a similar effect to energy inhibitors (data not shown). Together these results demonstrate that HBc particles are internalized by endocytosis. Uptake of viruses, virus-like particles and exogenous proteins occurs through various endocytic machineries (19Conner S.D. Schmid S.L. Nature. 2003; 422: 37-44Crossref PubMed Scopus (2979) Google Scholar). Two major routes that have been implicated in cell entry of arginine-rich, heparan sulfate-binding proteins include clathrin-mediated endocytosis and cholesterol-rich raft endocytosis (20Melikov K. Chernomordik L.V. Cell Mol. Life Sci. 2005; 62: 2739-2749Crossref PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar). To examine whether either of these pathways is involved in HBc core particle uptake, we used chlorpromazine and nystatin known to inhibit the formation of clathrin-coated pits and cholesterol-rich raft microdomains, respectively. HepG2 cells were untreated or treated with the drugs and incubated with HBc core particles. The cells were then washed with heparin, fixed, and immunostained using anti-HBcAg antibodies. Examination by confocal microscopy revealed that chlorpromazine completely inhibited particle uptake whereas nystatin had no substantial effect (Fig. 2A). Under the same conditions, nystatin substantially reduced uptake of cholera toxin subunit B known to penetrate cells through cholesterol-rich rafts (data not shown). These results suggest that HBc core particle entry requires clathrin-mediated endocytosis but not lipid raft microdomains. It was previously shown that pre-treatment of cells with NH4Cl followed by incubation of the cells in the presence of amiloride leads to cytosol acidification and blockage of clathrin-coated pit endocytosis (18Sandvig K. Olsnes S. Petersen O.W. van Deurs B. J. Cell Biol. 1987; 105: 679-689Crossref PubMed Scopus (252) Google Scholar). HepG2 cells were either untreated or subjected to cytosol acidification prior to incubation with HBc core particles. Immunofluorescent microscopy analysis showed that cytosol acidification resulted in abolishment of the signal representing internalized core (Fig. 2B), consistent with clathrin-mediated endocytosis of the particles into cells. To further examine the role of clathrin-mediated endocytosis in HBcAg uptake, we used a mutant form of Eps15 (Eps15Δ95/295) that lacks the second and third of the three EH domains of the protein (16Benmerah A. Bayrou M. Cerf-Bensussan N. Dautry-Varsat A. J. Cell Sci. 1999; 112: 1303-1311Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Eps15 binds the AP2 adaptor and overexpression of Eps15Δ95/295 generates a dominant negative effect that blocks the formation of clathrin-coated pits without affecting other endocytic pathways. HepG2 and COS-1 cells were transfected with constructs encoding either Eps15Δ95/295 fused to GFP (GFP-Eps15Δ95/295) or GFP alone. 24 h later the cells were incubated with HBc core particles and assayed for their capacity to internalize the particles by immunofluorescent microscopy. Overexpression of GFP alone had no effect on particle uptake (Fig. 2, C and D). By contrast, in cells overexpressing GFP-Eps15Δ95/295, entry of core particles was diminished. The stronger effect of GFP-Eps15Δ95/295 expression on particle entry into HepG2 cells relative to COS-1 cells likely results from its lower expression level in the latter cell line (compare relative fluorescent intensities of GFP-Eps15Δ95/295 in Fig. 2, C and D). Collectively, these results demonstrate that HBc core particles enter cells via clathrin-mediated endocytosis. Transport of HBc Core Particles from the Cell Surface Is Modulated by Rab5 GTPase—The small GTPase Rab5 controls vesicular transport of ligands from the plasma membrane to early endosomes and homotypic fusion between endosomes (21Gruenberg J. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 2: 721-730Crossref PubMed Scopus (571) Google Scholar). To test the possible involvement of the small GTPase Rab5 in HBc core particle uptake and trafficking, either wild-type (WT) Rab5 or different Rab5 mutants defective in the GTPase site were expressed in COS-1 cells. Rab5 S34N is a dominant negative GDP binding mutant that reduces the endocytosis efficiency of recycling and lysosomally destined ligands (22Stenmark H. Valencia A. Martinez O. Ullrich O. Goud B. Zerial M. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 575-583Crossref PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar, 23Vitelli R. Santillo M. Lattero D. Chiariello M. Bifulco M. Bruni C.B. Bucci C. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 4391-4397Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (247) Google Scholar). Rab5 Q79L is a GTPase-deficient, constitutively active mutant shown to increase ligand endocytosis (22Stenmark H. Valencia A. Martinez O. Ullrich O. Goud B. Zerial M. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 575-583Crossref PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar). Expression of WT Rab5 did not affect HBc particle uptake and particles partially co-localized with Rab5 within cells (Fig. 3). In cells expressing the constitutively active Rab5 Q79L, markedly enlarged endosomes were generated in agreement with a previous report (24Ceresa B.P. Lotscher M. Schmid S.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 9649-9654Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar) and HBcAg strongly accumulated in the Rab5 Q79L-containing endosomes. By contrast, in cells expressing the dominant negative Rab5 S34N, uptake of HBc core particles was strongly diminished. Similar results were obtained in HepG2 cells (data not shown). These results demonstrate that Rab5 regulates the vesicular transport of HBc core particles from the cell surface to early endosomes. HBc Core Particles Are Transported to Lysosomes Where HBcAg Is Cleaved into Its Distinct Domains by Cathepsin B—Ligands internalized by clathrin-mediated endocytosis are either recycled to the plasma membrane or targeted to late endosomes and lysosomes. To test the possibility that the internalized particles are targeted to lysosomes, FITC-labeled HBc core particles were applied to the culture medium of COS-1 cells for 6 h and LysoTracker-Red, a dye known to label lysosomes was added before cell fixation. Fluorescent confocal microscopy visualization revealed extensive co-localization of FITC-labeled HBc core particles with LysoTracker-Red in lysosomes (Fig. 4, A and B). Similar co-localization was observed in HepG2 cells (not shown). These results indicate that following clathrin-mediated entry and transport to early endosomes, the particles are destined to lysosomes. To examine the kinetics of core particle internalization and its lysosomal targeting. Cells were incubated with FITC-labeled HBc core particles for various times, and the lysosomes were stained with Lyso-Tracker red. The analysis showed that particles were becoming internalized into cells after 1 h (Fig. 4C). However, at this time point the internalized particles did not co-localize with LysoTracker-red in lysosomes. Limited co-localization of the particles with the lysosomal marker was noted after 2 h whereas the particles extensively co-localized with LysoTracker red after 4 h. These results indicate that core particle routing to lysosomes is relatively slow, resembling the lysosomal trafficking kinetics of HIV-1 Tat in cells (25Vendeville A. Rayne F. Bonhoure A. Bettache N. Montcourrier P. Beaumelle B. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2004; 15: 2347-2360Crossref PubMed Scopus (169) Google Scholar). To further investigate the fate of internalized HBcAg, we prepared total extracts from COS-1 cells incubated with HBc particles in the absence or presence of energy inhibitors and washed with normal medium or heparin-containing medium as described in the legend to Fig. 1. The extracts were subjected to Western blot analysis using mac22, a monoclonal antibody that recognizes an epitope between residues 110 and 130 of HBcAg. A 21-kDa reactive band corresponding to HBcAg monomers was detected in the extracts prepared from cells incubated with HBc particles (Fig. 5A, lane 1). Interestingly, an additional band of 16 kDa was observed in the same total extract. No signal was detected in cells incubated with HBc particle in the continuous presence of heparin (Fig. 5A, lane 2), consistent with the immunofluorescent analysis (Fig. 1B). In cells incubated with HBc particles and washed with medium containing heparin prior to cell harvest, the intensity of the 21-kDa band was abolished (Fig. 5A, lane 3). By contrast, the intensity of the 16-kDa band in the same cell extract was unaffected, suggesting it represents endocytosed HBcAg that underwent processing. Consistently, the 16-kDa band was not detected in the extract prepared from energy-deprived cells (Fig. 5A, lane 4). No signal was detected in cells treated with energy inhibitors and washed with heparin (Fig. 5A, lane 5), consistent with the immunofluorescent analysis (Fig. 1E). Similar results were obtained when externally associated particles were removed from the cell surface by trypsin (data not shown). Together, these results indicate that HBcAg is processed following particle entry into cells. In an attempt to characterize the processed product of internalized HBcAg, two HBcAg mutants lacking the last 13 or 23 C-terminal residues of HBcAg (HBc-172 and HBc-162, respectively) were prepared in E. coli. Samples from the purified protein preparations were subjected to SDS-PAGE and Western blotting with mac22, revealing reactive bands of the expected sizes for both mutants (Fig. 5B, left panel). The mutant and full-length HBcAg proteins migrated similarly as sharp bands following electrophoresis on a native agarose gel (Fig. 5B, right panel) and had similar sedimentation velocity in rate zonal ultracentrifugation (Fig. 5C), confirming their particulate structure. Immunofluorescent microscopy analysis of COS-1 cells incubated with the different particles and washed with heparin showed that both mutants retained the capacity to become endocytosed by cells (Fig. 5D). Next, total extracts from COS-1 cells incubated with HBc-162, HBc-172 or full-length HBc core particles and washed with normal medium prior to cell harvest were analyzed by Western blotting with mac22. The analysis showed bands at the expected sizes for the different particle monomers in the respective extracts (Fig. 5E). An additional 16-kDa reactive band was detected in all three extracts. These results indicate that the full-length and mutant particles were all processed intracellularly. The similar size for the processing products derived from the full-length and C-terminally truncated mutants indicated that these 16 kDa products do not contain the 23 C-terminal residues of HBcAg. To detect smaller HBcAg-derived products in the total cell extracts analyzed in Fig. 5A, the same extracts were subjected to electrophoresis through a Tris-Tricine gel. Western blotting with mac22 detected 21-kDa HBcAg monomers and the 16-kDa processing product as before (Fig. 5F, left panel). The blot was stripped and re-probed with pac74, a polyclonal anti-HBcAg antibody. Under these conditions, pac74 preferentially recognizes the arginine-rich domain of HBcAg (data not shown). pac74 reacted with the 21-kDa HBcAg monomers but not with the 16-kDa processed product (Fig. 5F, right panel). This result indicates that the 16-kDa product does not contain the arginine-rich domain of HBcAg and is consistent with the observations made with the HBcAg truncation mutants. Remarkably, pac74 reacted with an additional, smaller band of 5 kDa (Fig. 5F, right panel). The 5-kDa band was resistant to heparin wash and was absent in extracts retrieved from energy-deprived cells (Fig. 5F, lanes 3–5), indicating this product was generated following particle endocytosis. Together, these results indicate that the 21-kDa HBcAg monomer is cleaved into its 16-kDa assembly domain and 5-kDa arginine-rich domain following particle entry into cells. The lysosome contains various proteases, including serine, aspartic acid, and cysteine proteases responsible for processing of exogenous proteins taken up by endocytosis. The lysosomal localization of the particle suggests that processing of HBcAg is generated by endoproteolytic cleavage in this compartment. To test this possibility, cells were incubated with HBc core particles in the absence or presence of different inhibitors of lysosomal proteases. The cells were washed with medium containing heparin prior to cell harvest and total cell extracts were analyzed by Western blotting. Chloroquine, a general inhibitor of lysosomal proteases prevented cleavage of HBcAg (Fig. 6A, lane 2). Aprotinin and pepstatin A known to inhibit serine and aspartic acid proteases, respectively, did not affect HBcAg processing (Fig. 6A, lanes 3 and 4). By contrast, in the presence of E64d which inhibits cysteine proteases HBcAg cleavage was inhibited (Fig. 6A, lane 5). Furthermore, Z-FA-fmk, a specific inhibitor of the cysteine protease cathepsin B prevented the cleavage (Fig. 6A, lane 6). Thus, we conclude that lysosomal cathepsin B is responsible for the endoproteolytic cleavage of HBcAg. Finally, we also characterized the mobility of internalized particles on a native agarose gel. Particulate HBV core particles typically migrate as a distinctive band on native agarose gels and their migration is disturbed following particle disassembly (26Konig S. Beterams G. Nassal M. J. Virol. 1998; 72: 4997-5005Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Particles taken from the culture media at the end of the incubation period migrated as a distinct band (Fig. 6B, lane 1), indicating the particularity of HBcAg was not disturbed prior to cell attachment and entry. By contrast, the migration of HBcAg present in the lysate of heparin-washed cells was smeary (Fig. 6B, lane 2). The distinct particle migration was largely restored for HBcAg present in the lysate of heparin-washed cells incubated with HBc particles in the presence of chloroquine (Fig. 6B, lane 3). Together these results suggest that HBcAg cleavage promotes particle disassembly following cell entry. Previous studies by us and by others demonstrated that the arginine-rich domain of HBcAg interacts with sulfated heparan sulfate proteoglycans to mediate core particle attachment to a wide variety of cell types including macrophages and B cells (14Cooper A. Tal G. Lider O. Shaul Y. J. Immunol. 2005; 175: 3165-3176Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar, 15Vanlandschoot P. Van Houtte F. Serruys B. Leroux-Roels G. J. Gen. Virol. 2005; 86: 75-84Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). We show here that the attachment step is followed by clathrin-mediated endocytosis of the particles, depending on Eps15 and the small GTPase Rab5. The internalized cores are transported via early endosomes to lysosomes, where HBcAg is cleaved into its distinct domains by cathepsin B and the particle dissociates. The family of mammalian heparan sulfate proteoglycans includes six GPI-anchored glypicans and four transmembrane syndecans that bind a wide variety of ligands (27Bernfield M. Gotte M. Park P.W. Reizes O. Fitzgerald M.L. Lincecum J. Zako M. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1999; 68: 729-777Crossref PubMed Scopus (2281) Google Scholar). The mechanisms for ligand internalization may vary depending on the nature of the ligand and the proteoglycan that binds it, as well as on additional receptors that may participate in ligand binding. Using chlorpromazine, cytosol acidification and a dominant negative form of Eps15 we were able to show that core particle internalization is specifically attained via clathrin-mediated endocytosis. Clathrin-mediated particle uptake was observed in various cell types, including human THP-1 macrophages (data not shown). Further, in all cell types examined the particles were transported to lysosomes, leading to cathepsin B-dependent cleavage and processing of HBcAg. These findings suggest that a common yet specific pathway exists for particle uptake and trafficking in cells. The specificity may result from the multimeric nature of the particle, clustering heparan sulfate proteoglycans upon binding. The clustering may in turn drive movement of heparan sulfate proteoglycans into clathrin-coated pits. Alternatively, uptake and trafficking of the core particle may follow a constitutive lysosomal turnover pathway of the heparan sulfate proteoglycan serving as its receptor. The latter possibility is in line with the lysosomal route responsible for cellular catabolism of heparan sulfate proteoglycans (28Yanagishita M. Hascall V.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 9451-9454Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Lysosomal targeting of the particle is followed by cathepsin B-mediated HBcAg cleavage. The cleavage site resides in a region linking the assembly and arginine-rich domains of HBcAg. This finding is consistent with a previous in vitro study showing that a protease-sensitive hinge links the assembly and arginine-rich domains of particulate HBcAg (29Seifer M. Standring D.N. J. Virol. 1994; 68: 5548-5555Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The mobility of endocytosed HBcAg through a native agarose gel suggests that the particle becomes destabilized following HBcAg cleavage. This suggestion is consistent with previous studies showing that core particles genetically or proteolytically deleted of the arginine-rich domain are substantially less stable than full-length particles (2Birnbaum F. Nassal M. J. Virol. 1990; 64: 3319-3330Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 30Gallina A. Bonelli F. Zentilin L. Rindi G. Muttini M. Milanesi G. J. Virol. 1989; 63: 4645-4652Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 31Wingfield P.T. Stahl S.J. Williams R.W. Steven A.C. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 4919-4932Crossref PubMed Scopus (190) Google Scholar). In addition, non-proteolytic changes in HBcAg may be induced by the lysosomal environment (e.g. disulfide bond reduction) to further facilitate particle destabilization. While attempting to map the cleavage site within HBcAg, we found that particles lacking the 23 C-terminal residues of the monomer (HBc-162) attach and enter cells with similar efficiency to full-length HBc particles. We further found that core particles completely deleted of the arginine-rich domain of HBcAg (residues 150–185) do not bind cells (data not shown), consistent with the role played by this region in capsid cell attachment (14Cooper A. Tal G. Lider O. Shaul Y. J. Immunol. 2005; 175: 3165-3176Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar, 15Vanlandschoot P. Van Houtte F. Serruys B. Leroux-Roels G. J. Gen. Virol. 2005; 86: 75-84Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). Thus, residues 150–162 are necessary whereas residues 163–185 are dispensable for core particle cell attachment and entry. Arginine-rich sequences exposed on the shell surface have been suggested to interact with negatively charged heparan sulfate glycosaminoglycans to mediate particle cell attachment (14Cooper A. Tal G. Lider O. Shaul Y. J. Immunol. 2005; 175: 3165-3176Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar). Our finding that residues 150–162 of HBcAg are responsible for core particle cell attachment lends further support to this notion because residues 150–159 but not 165–175 of HBcAg were shown to be exposed on the surface of intact core particles (29Seifer M. Standring D.N. J. Virol. 1994; 68: 5548-5555Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Recombinant HBV core particles have been used as carriers of foreign epitopes and ODN for vaccination and delivery purposes (4Pumpens P. Grens E. Intervirology. 2001; 44: 98-114Crossref PubMed Scopus (232) Google Scholar, 10Cooper A. Shaul Y. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2005; 327: 1094-1099Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar, 11Storni T. Ruedl C. Schwarz K. Schwendener R.A. Renner W.A. Bachmann M.F. J.

Immunol. 2003; 171: 5198-5207Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). Capture of core particles by heparan sulfate proteoglycans followed by their clathrin-mediated uptake and lysosomal trafficking is likely at the basis of these processes. Cathepsin B-mediated cleavage at a position linking the assembly and arginine-rich domains of HBcAg is expected to trigger the release of the encapsulated cargo in the lysosome in a stepwise manner. First, HBcAg cleavage causes detachment of cargo bound by the arginine-rich domain (e.g. ODN) from the particle lattice. Second, because HBcAg cleavage promotes particle dissociation it would eventually allow the physical escape of the encapsulated cargo from the capsid interior. Thus, HBcAg cleavage followed by particle dissociation can facilitate release of the antigenic peptides and encapsulated ODN in lysosomes, allowing peptide loading on class II MHC molecules and TLR9 signaling, respectively. Furthermore, the acidic environment in lysosomes could possibly permit translocation of HBcAg and the delivered cargo to the cytoplasm, as was recently demonstrated for HIV-1 Tat and cationic peptides (25Vendeville A. Rayne F. Bonhoure A. Bettache N. Montcourrier P. Beaumelle B. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2004; 15: 2347-2360Crossref PubMed Scopus (169) Google Scholar, 32Fischer R. Kohler K. Fotin-Mleczek M. Brock R. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 12625-12635Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (263) Google Scholar). Cytoplasmic translocation following lysosomal delivery could drive cross-presentation of peptides carried by the particle (9Storni T. Bachmann M.F. J. Immunol. 2004; 172: 6129-6135Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar) and could allow delivery of encapsulated macromolecules into the cytosol and the nucleus. Finally, the possibility that native HBV core particles undergo endocytosis and lysosomal cleavage may have implications for HBcAg immunogenicity during HBV infection. Exogenous HBcAg uptake and processing are important for presentation of HBcAg T cell epitopes on MHC class II molecules (33Diepolder H.M. Ries G. Jung M.C. Schlicht H.J. Gerlach J.T. Gruener N. Caselmann W.H. Pape G.R. Gastroenterology. 1999; 116: 650-657Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). Uptake and lysosomal processing by antigen-presenting cells is expected to trigger CD4+ T cell activation, whereas entry and processing by HBV-infected hepatocytes known to express MHC class II but no co-stimulatory molecules is expected to result in immune tolerance (33Diepolder H.M.

Thus, particle uptake and processing during HBV infection is possibly involved in the intricate processes of immune activation and immune evasion by the virus.

https://openalex.org/W2029094986,"Using ion channel reconstitution in planar lipid bilayers, we examined the channel-forming activity of subfractions of Pseudomonas aeruginosa OprF, which was shown to exist in two different conformations: a minority single domain conformer and a majority two-domain conformer (Sugawara, E., Nestorovich, E. M., Bezrukov, S. M., and Nikaido, H. (2006) J. Biol. Chem. 281, 16220–16229). With the fraction depleted for the single domain conformer, we were unable to detect formation of any channels with well defined conductance levels. With the unfractionated OprF, we saw only rare channel formation. However, with the single domain-enriched fraction of OprF, we observed regular insertion of channels with highly reproducible conductances. Single OprF channels demonstrate rich kinetic behavior exhibiting spontaneous transitions between several subconformations that differ in ionic conductance and radius measured in polymer exclusion experiments. Although we showed that the effective radius of the most conductive conformation exceeds that of the general outer membrane porin of Escherichia coli, OmpF, we also found that a single OprF channel mainly exists in weakly conductive subconformations and switches to the fully open state for a short time only. Therefore, the low permeability of OprF reported earlier may be due to two factors: mainly to the paucity of the single domain conformer in the OprF population and secondly to the predominance of weakly conductive subconformations within the single domain conformer. Using ion channel reconstitution in planar lipid bilayers, we examined the channel-forming activity of subfractions of Pseudomonas aeruginosa OprF, which was shown to exist in two different conformations: a minority single domain conformer and a majority two-domain conformer (Sugawara, E., Nestorovich, E. M., Bezrukov, S. M., and Nikaido, H. (2006) J. Biol. Chem. 281, 16220–16229). With the fraction depleted for the single domain conformer, we were unable to detect formation of any channels with well defined conductance levels. With the unfractionated OprF, we saw only rare channel formation. However, with the single domain-enriched fraction of OprF, we observed regular insertion of channels with highly reproducible conductances. Single OprF channels demonstrate rich kinetic behavior exhibiting spontaneous transitions between several subconformations that differ in ionic conductance and radius measured in polymer exclusion experiments. Although we showed that the effective radius of the most conductive conformation exceeds that of the general outer membrane porin of Escherichia coli, OmpF, we also found that a single OprF channel mainly exists in weakly conductive subconformations and switches to the fully open state for a short time only. Therefore, the low permeability of OprF reported earlier may be due to two factors: mainly to the paucity of the single domain conformer in the OprF population and secondly to the predominance of weakly conductive subconformations within the single domain conformer. The channel properties of OprF, the major nonspecific porin of Pseudomonas aeruginosa, have been studied by several methods. Early studies (1Hancock R.E.W. Nikaido H. J. Bacteriol. 1978; 136: 381-390Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 2Hancock R.E.W. Decad G.M. Nikaido H. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1979; 554: 323-331Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar), utilizing the near equilibrium redistribution of radiolabeled solutes initially trapped in reconstituted liposomes, have suggested that the channel was large. OprF allows nearly complete outward diffusion of polysaccharides of 2,000–3,000 daltons in contrast to the Escherichia coli general porin channel that is permeable to sugars of only up to 600 daltons. Kinetic studies of solute diffusion (3Yoshimura F. Zalman L.S. Nikaido H. J. Biol. Chem. 1983; 258: 2308-2314Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 4Nikaido H. Nikaido K. Harayama S. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 770-779Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), using osmotic swelling of proteoliposomes, have shown that OprF has much lower permeability (i.e. allows much slower permeation of the same test solute) than the classical trimeric porins of E. coli but forms channels that are wider than the channels of E. coli porins because the diffusion rates are much less influenced by the size of the oligosaccharide solutes. Intact E. coli cells expressing OprF porin from plasmid-coded gene are capable of growing on raffinose (5Bellido F. Martin N.L. Siehnel R.J. Hancock R.E.W. J. Bacteriol. 1992; 174: 5196-5203Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), which is too large (505 daltons) to serve as an effective carbon source for the wild-type E. coli. A number of studies of OprF have been carried out with planar bilayer systems. The first study by Benz and Hancock (6Benz R. Hancock R.E.W. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1981; 646: 298-308Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar) has already shown that the addition of OprF produces channels of large single channel conductance (several nanosiemens (nS) 2The abbreviations used are: nS, nanosiemens; pS, picosiemens; PEG, poly(ethylene glycol).2The abbreviations used are: nS, nanosiemens; pS, picosiemens; PEG, poly(ethylene glycol). in 1 m KCl or NaCl) that are also large by other criteria, such as indifference to the nature of the permeating ions and proportionality of channel conductance to the concentration of salt solutions used. It has also been reported that OprF channel-forming activity is 100-fold lower than that of E. coli porins. However, the behavior of OprF channel is rather complex and probably sensitive to experimental details, so that quite different conclusions were reached in later studies. Thus Woodruff et al. (7Woodruff W.A. Parr Jr., T.R. Hancock R.E.W. Hanne Nicas L.F. Iglewski T. I.B.H. J. Bacteriol. 1986; 167: 473-479Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) have reported that OprF produces mostly “small” channels whose conductances in 1 m KCl range from 0.1 to 1 nS with an average of 0.36 nS. The occurrence of rare larger channels was mentioned, but neither the actual current recordings nor conductance histograms illustrating this finding were given. In the most recent study by Brinkman et al. (8Brinkman F.S.L. Bains M. Hancock R.E.W. J. Bacteriol. 2000; 182 (Correction (2000) J. Bacteriol. 182, 6863): 5251-5255Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar) the predominance of the small channels, with a broad distribution of conductances from 0.2 to 0.8 nS, has been confirmed. It has also been reported that channels with a similar conductance distribution are formed by the truncated OprF containing only its N-terminal domain. Because most of the planar bilayer studies were performed on unfractionated OprF, which is now known to be a mixture of two completely different conformers (9Sugawara E. Nestorovich E.M. Bezrukov S.M. Nikaido H. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 16220-16229Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar), we decided to examine the properties of channels formed by OprF in more detail using preparations enriched in different conformers. We also used the poly(ethylene glycol) partition assay (10Krasilnikov O.V. Sabirov R.Z. Ternovsky V.I. Merzlyak P.G. Muratkhodjaev J.N. FEMS Microbiol.

Macromolecules. 2004; 37: 2650-2657Crossref Scopus (36) Google Scholar) to gauge the pore size. Bacterial Strains and Their Cultivation—P. aeruginosa PAO1 was used as the source of OprF. The plasmid for the expression of the N-terminal domain of OprF was constructed as follows. The portion of oprF gene coding for residues 1 through 170 of the mature OprF was cloned by PCR amplification by using a forward primer containing a PstI site and a backward primer containing a stop codon and a BamHI site. The amplicon, after restriction endonuclease treatment, was ligated between the PstI and BamHI sites of the vector pBCKS(+) (Stratagene) previously modified by inserting a sequence coding for the signal sequence of E. coli OmpA protein followed by the hexahistidine tag (or the tag and the enterokinase cleavage site sequence) just in front of the PstI site (see Ref. 9Sugawara E. Nestorovich E.M. Bezrukov S.M. Nikaido H. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 16220-16229Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). After confirming the correctness of the sequence, an EcoRI-NotI fragment was excised from the recombinant plasmid and was inserted into a medium copy number vector, pKY9790 (obtained from K. Yoshida), digested with these two enzymes. This is a 5.10-kb plasmid with the pBR322 origin, chloramphenicol selection marker, lacI gene, and a ptac promoter. The recombinant plasmid, pKY-OprFN, was transformed into E. coli host BLR (Novagen). Bacteria were grown in LB medium containing 0.5–1% glucose (and 30 μg/ml chloramphenicol when needed for plasmid maintenance) with aeration by rotary shaking. Preparation of the N-terminal Domain of OprF—Overnight culture (30 ml) of E. coli BLR containing pKY-OprFN at 30 °C was diluted into 1 liter of fresh LB medium containing 30 μg/ml chloramphenicol, and the suspension was incubated at 30 °C with shaking until the A600 reached 0.6. At this time, 0.1 mm isopropyl 1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside was added to initiate the expression of the truncated OprF, and the incubation was continued for a further 3 h. Crude cell envelope fraction was prepared by French pressure cell disruption, and it was then extracted with octyl β-d-glucoside as described for intact OprF (9Sugawara E. Nestorovich E.M. Bezrukov S.M. Nikaido H. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 16220-16229Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). The truncated OprF, with the N-terminal hexahistidine tag, was purified by using a nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid Superflow column (Qiagen) according to the manufacturer's instructions. The fragment lacking the hexahistidine tag was made from a plasmid containing the tag in front of the enterokinase cleavage site. The protein was purified as above and treated with enterokinase, and the flow-through fraction from a nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid column was collected. The absence of the hexahistidine tag was further confirmed by SDS-PAGE. Preparation of Unfractionated OprF Protein—P. aeruginosa OprF protein was purified as described in the preceding article (9Sugawara E. Nestorovich E.M. Bezrukov S.M. Nikaido H. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 16220-16229Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar) by selective detergent solubilization of the outer membrane followed by ion-exchange chromatography and gel filtration. Isolation of Open Conformer-enriched and Open Conformer-depleted Fractions of OprF through High Resolution Size Fractionation—We utilized the tendency for the open conformers to form oligomers (especially at high concentrations) as follows. OprF samples were fractionated by gel filtration with a 1.5 × 90-cm column of high resolution medium with narrow particle size distribution (Toyo Pearl HW-50F, Tosoh Biosep, Montgomeryville, PA). The buffer used contained 0.1% (w/v) dodecyl maltoside, 0.4 m NaCl, 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 1 mm dithiothreitol, and 3 mm NaN3. Fractions of 0.5 ml each were collected and analyzed for protein with A280 or BCA protein assay reagent (Pierce) and for pore-forming activity with liposome swelling assay (described below). The tailing edge of the OprF peak had little pore-forming activity and could be used as open channel-depleted fraction. The leading edge, which had a pore-forming activity that was much higher than the bulk OprF (9Sugawara E. Nestorovich E.M. Bezrukov S.M. Nikaido H. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 16220-16229Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar), was fractionated once more by gel filtration, and again the leading edge of the OprF peak was collected. In this manner, we could obtain open channel-enriched fraction that had specific poreforming activity at least 5 times higher than the unfractionated OprF. This was used for further studies. The specific activity of various fractions in liposome swelling with l-arabinose as the solute was 4.7, 24, and 0.7 milliabsorbance unit/μg of protein/min for unfractionated, open form-enriched, and open form-depleted OprF samples, respectively. Each number represents an average of five samples. Proteoliposome Swelling Assay of Pore-forming Activity—Pore-forming activity was assayed by the osmotic swelling rates of proteoliposomes containing different amounts of OprF (4Nikaido H. Nikaido K. Harayama S. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 770-779Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Proteoliposomes were made in 15% Dextran T-40 (originally obtained from Pharmacia Corp.), and isoosmotic solutions of various compounds were used to examine the effect of solute size on penetration rate (4Nikaido H. Nikaido K. Harayama S. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 770-779Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Single Channel Reconstitution—“Solvent-free” bilayer lipid membranes were formed as described elsewhere (13Rostovtseva T.K. Nestorovich E.M. Bezrukov S.M. Biophys. J. 2002; 82: 160-169Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar). The film and the membrane capacitances were close to 25 picofarads each. The single channel measurements were carried out at room temperature of 23 ± 2 °C; the aqueous phase of the membrane chamber contained 1 m KCl and 5 mm Tris or HEPES at pH 7.42. Single channel insertion was achieved by adding 1–5 μl of 30 μg/ml open channel-enriched OprF stock solution (P. aeruginosa PAO1 was used as the source of OprF) in the buffer that contained 1 m KCl and 1% (v/v) octyl polyoxyethylene (Alexis Biochemicals Corp., Lausanne, Switzerland) to 1.5 ml of aqueous phase in the “cis” compartment of the chamber after a bilayer membrane had been formed. For the multichannel experiments (see Fig. 10A of the present study as well as Fig. 6 in the preceding article (9Sugawara E. Nestorovich E.M. Bezrukov S.M. Nikaido H. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 16220-16229Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar)), we used 0.6–2 mg/ml OprF stock solution. Under otherwise equal conditions, the channel-forming concentration of OprF exceeded that of OmpF (13Rostovtseva T.K. Nestorovich E.M. Bezrukov S.M. Biophys.

The sign of potential is defined as positive when potential is higher at the side of protein addition.FIGURE 6A, conductance as a function of applied voltage for a single OprF channel in the weakly conductive L (which is represented by Llow(1) and Llow(2) averaged by filtering over a time interval of 0. 1 s, •) and highly conductive Lhigh (○) substates. The fast flickering events of OprF channel between the Llow and Lhigh states were observable only at negative voltages (see Fig. 4 for illustration), so the data for positive voltages are absent.

Data were filtered by a low pass eight-pole Butterworth filter (Model 9002, Frequency Devices, Inc., Haverhill, MA) at 15 kHz, recorded simultaneously by a video cassette recorder operated in a digital mode, and directly saved into the computer memory with a sampling frequency of 50 kHz. Amplitude analysis was done using software developed in house. Estimation of Pore Size Using the Partitioning of Poly(ethylene Glycol)—The poly(ethylene glycol) partition assay (10Krasilnikov O.V.

The design of the chamber permitted the change of membrane-bathing solution without damaging the membrane. In a typical experiment, a bilayer was first formed by raising solutions in both chamber compartments 2 mm above the opening in the partition. After a single OprF channel was inserted and its parameters were recorded, the bathing solution near the membrane was changed by slowly replacing the initial electrolyte with 15% (w/w) solutions of differently sized poly(ethylene glycol)s (Aldrich). The change of the bathing solution took 0.5 min. To keep the ion/water molar ratio constant, the polymers were added to 1 m KCl stock solutions. At the end of each experiment the contents of both compartments were taken to measure conductivity using a CDM 83 conductivity meter (Radiometer, Copenhagen, Denmark) to determine the actual polymer concentrations in the experimental cell. The preceding study (9Sugawara E. Nestorovich E.M. Bezrukov S.M. Nikaido H. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 16220-16229Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar) has demonstrated that OprF protein exists in two distinct conformations: the majority two-domain conformer (similar to the major conformer of OmpA) with the separate N-terminal eight-stranded transmembrane domain and the C-terminal periplasmic domain, which interacts with the peptidoglycan (18Rawlings E.G. Brinkman F.S. Hancock R.E.W. J. Bacteriol. 1998; 180: 3556-3562Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), and the minority conformer that apparently folds as a larger single domain β-barrel. The Channel-forming Activity of OprF N-terminal Domain in Liposome Swelling—The N-terminal domain of OprF has been produced by the cloning of the 5′-terminal part of the oprF gene earlier (8Brinkman F.S.L. Bains M. Hancock R.E.W. J. Bacteriol. 2000; 182 (Correction (2000) J. Bacteriol. 182, 6863): 5251-5255Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). However, it was not clear whether this domain actually functions as a small channel for nutrients because only planar bilayer studies were done. We therefore examined the channel-forming activity of this construct by using the osmotic swelling of proteoliposomes. The protein coded by the truncated oprF gene was preceded by a hexahistidine tag and the signal sequence of OmpA and under our conditions nearly exclusively found in the outer membrane fraction (not shown). Its signal sequence was cleaved off as the product had the correct size for the sum of the 1–170 N-terminal domain of the mature OprF and a hexahistidine tag by SDS-PAGE and by mass spectrometry. The results of proteoliposome swelling assay (Fig. 1) showed that this domain cannot facilitate transport of even the smallest of organic nutrients, including l-arabinose, l-alanine, and glycine. Although we also used urea and erythritol for the assay, these solutes traversed the membrane bilayer at significant rates so that an unequivocal conclusion could not be obtained for these solutes. OprF in the Open Channel-enriched Preparations Has the Correct Pore Size—Comparison of swelling rates with sugars of different sizes allows the estimation of pore size by the use of the Renkin approximation (19Renkin E.M. J. Gen. Physiol. 1954; 38: 225-243PubMed Google Scholar). This approach has been used for the E. coli OmpF channel (20Nikaido H. Rosenberg E.Y. J. Gen. Physiol. 1981; 77: 121-135Crossref PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar) and has led to an estimate that is very close to the actual size of the constriction zone of the channel as defined by x-ray crystallography (21Cowan S.W. Schirmer T. Rummel G. Steiert M. Ghosh R. Pauptit R.A. Jansonius J.N. Rosenbusch J.P. Nature. 1992; 358: 727-733Crossref PubMed Scopus (1318) Google Scholar). The same approach earlier led to the estimation of 2-nm diameter for the OprF channel (3Yoshimura F. Zalman L.S. Nikaido H. J. Biol. Chem. 1983; 258: 2308-2314Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 4Nikaido H. Nikaido K. Harayama S. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 770-779Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). However, these studies were all performed with unfractionated OprF. Now that we have been able to obtain fractions enriched for the open channel conformers, with the specific activity much higher than that of the unfractionated protein, we compared these two preparations for the channel size. The results (Fig. 2) showed that the open channel-enriched fraction had a wide diameter very similar to that of the unfractionated OprF, thus confirming that the enrichment did not result from the purification of other contaminating poreforming proteins. Open Channel-enriched Fraction in Bilayer Reconstitution Experiments—Of the three different OprF fractions: open channel-enriched OprF sample, unfractionated OprF sample, and open channel-depleted OprF sample, we started with the channel-forming activity of the first one. At low concentrations of about 0.02–0.1 μg/ml, the open channel-enriched fraction induced well defined channels displaying several conductance substates and rich kinetic behavior. A typical current recording showing consecutive insertion of two OprF channels with amplitude of about 30–40 picosiemens (pS) under the applied voltage of–150 mV is given in Fig. 3 at 50-ms time resolution. In addition, intensive downward flickering to much higher currents was always seen. The amplitude of these flickering events measured at higher resolution (see below) was close to 1 nS. Although this recording shows definite “channel-like” behavior, its interpretation is rather complicated due to the presence of at least two levels of different conductance. One of the main questions is whether these conductance levels represent two types of OprF-induced channels as was suggested before (8Brinkman F.S.L. Bains M. Hancock R.E.W. J. Bacteriol. 2000; 182 (Correction (2000) J. Bacteriol. 182, 6863): 5251-5255Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar) or show two different substates of the same OprF channel. To answer this question we performed most of the measurements at the level of minimal OprF-induced conductance. The current recordings in Fig. 4 illustrate one such experiments. Typically channel insertion was manifested by a small stepwise increase in the membrane conductance with the voltage-dependent amplitude corresponding to about 6 and 8 pA (40 and 55 pS) for –150 and 150 mV, respectively. These small current steps are marked as Llow levels for the uppermost (–150 mV) and lowermost (150 mV) tracks in Fig. 4. Insertion of OprF channels into the membrane following the cis side addition of the protein was directional (with one exception in about 50 experiments). Indeed at negative voltages the low conductance (Llow) level was always accompanied by intense flickering to a highly conductive level (Lhigh) with an amplitude of about 140–150 pA (0.93–1 nS) (Fig. 4, see the uppermost track), whereas at positive potentials this flickering was completely absent (Fig. 4, see the lowermost track). Time averaging for the topmost and lowermost current tracks was 10 ms. Several time-resolved flickering events are presented in the two central plots of Fig. 4 at 20-μs time resolution. Average residence time at the high conductance level obtained from spectral analysis (see below) was about 0.8 ms at –150 mV. Interestingly some time-resolved events of high conductance flickering had an intermediate conductance level with amplitude (Lintermediate) of 50–70 pA (0.3–0.47 nS). When positive voltages were applied (Fig. 4, the lowermost track), the OprF channel existed only in the weakly conductive state (Llow). Our analysis suggests that the current recordings in Fig. 4 represent only one OprF channel and not a superposition of two or more different channels. Indeed the channel always appeared as a step from zero to the low conductance level and only then reached the higher one. Moreover at negative voltages and observation intervals of several seconds, we never observed channels that would exhibit only high (Lhigh) or only low (Llow) conductance levels. The behavior shown in Fig. 4 was typical. OprF channels spontaneously flickered between the two conductance levels, although the flickering frequency could be different from channel to channel and, for some channels, was time-dependent. In this case, flickering to the high conductance level was clustered in bursts of several seconds separated by shorter intervals of relative silence. On closer examination it turned out that the lower conductance level (Llow) itself was also represented by two discrete conductances. In Fig. 5A we show that the noise of this level seen in Fig. 4 actually represents fast fluctuations between two distinct sublevels (marked as Llow(1) and Llow(2) in the inset) with a characteristic time at the submillisecond scale. The amplitude histogram of these fluctuations is given in Fig. 5B. The bold arrows in Fig. 5, A and B, indicate the difference between the average currents of the sublevels (2.5 and 7.5 pA under the indicated conditions). The relative time the channel spends in the Llow(1) versus Llow(2) substate was quite reproducible in independent experiments and was close to 0.5 at –150 mV applied voltage. Again analysis of the amplitudes of the levels and their probability distributions demonstrates that these events belong to a single OprF channel. Fig. 6A illustrates conductance dependence of the two major OprF channel levels (Llow and Lhigh) on the transmembrane voltage. Because we could not observe any fast flickering events at positive voltages, data for the high conductance level are given for the negative potentials only. It is seen that OprF in the high conductance state is ohmic, i.e. shows voltage-independent conductance, whereas the conductance of the weakly conductive subconformation is a strong function of applied voltage. Close to ohmic behavior is characteristic of highly conductive β-barrel channels such as OmpF at high salt concentrations (e.g. see Ref. 17Nestorovich E.M. Rostovtseva T.K. Bezrukov S.M. Biophys. J. 2003; 85: 3718-3729Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar). On the other hand, weakly conductive β-barrel channels such as LamB exhibit a pronounced non-linearity: ionic current is superlinear in voltage (22Bezrukov S.M. Kullman L. Winterhalter M. FEBS Lett. 2000; 476: 224-228Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar, 23Kullman L. Winterhalter M. Bezrukov S.M. Biophys. J. 2002; 82: 803-812Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar). The reason for this non-linearity is not clear at the moment. Importantly, channel conductance from experiment to experiment was varying within the limits typical to those in other channel reconstitution experiments. Fig. 6B shows the histograms of channel conductances in Llow and Lhigh states collected from 60 independent channels. The solid lines through the data are Gaussian. The logarithmic scale was chosen because of an ∼25-fold difference in average conductance of these states. Kinetic Properties of OprF Channels—The results presented above demonstrate the dynamic behavior of single OprF channels. The channel fluctuates between its high and low conductance in a voltage-dependent manner. Fig. 4 shows that the transitions to the high conductance state, abundant at negative voltages, virtually disappear at positive voltages. In addition, the weakly conductive state itself fluctuates between two substates, Llow(1) and Llow(2) (Fig. 5). To characterize the kinetics of these transitions quantitatively, one needs to perform an appropriate statistical analysis of the data. The most important characteristics, such as the average lifetime in a particular state or average frequency of events, can be found by many methods. Because the characteristic times of the OprF channel fluctuations are rather short, we chose single channel noise analysis (11Bezrukov S.M. Vodyanoy I. Biophys.

https://openalex.org/W2080842490,"Polyphenol phytoalexin (resveratrol), found in grapes and red wine is a strong chemopreventive agent with promising safety records with human consumption and unique forms of cell death induction in a variety of tumor cells. However, the mechanism of resveratrol-induced apoptosis upstream of mitochondria is still not defined. The results from this study suggest that caspase-2 activation occurs upstream of mitochondria in resveratrol-treated cells. The upstream activation of caspase-2 is not dependent on its antioxidant property or NF-κB inhibition. The activated caspase-2 triggers mitochondrial apoptotic events by inducing conformational changes in Bax/Bak with subsequent release of cytochrome c, apoptosis-inducing factor, and endonuclease G. Caspase-8 activation seems to be independent of these events and does not appear to be mediated by classical death receptor processing or downstream caspases. Both caspase-2 and caspase-8 contribute toward the mitochondrial translocation of Bid, since neither caspase-8 inhibition nor caspase-2 inhibition could prevent translocation of Bid DsRed into mitochondria. Caspase-2 inhibitors or antisense silencing of caspase-2 prevented cell death induced by resveratrol and partially prevented processing of downstream caspases, including caspase-9, caspase-3, and caspase-8. Studies using mouse embryonic fibroblasts deficient for both Bax and Bak indicate the contribution of both Bax and Bak in mediating cell death induced by resveratrol and the existence of Bax/Bak-independent cell death possibly through caspase-8- or caspase-2-mediated mitochondria-independent downstream caspase processing.

Resveratrol (3,4,5-trihydroxy-trans-stilbene), a natural plant polyphenol widely present in foods such as grapes, wine, and peanuts is gaining acceptance as a potential antitumor agent because of its ability to inhibit various stages of carcinogenesis and eliminate preneoplastic cells in vitro and in vivo (1Jang M.

Recent support to develop this compound as a potential antitumor agent is based on its ability to induce programmed cell death in transformed cells with relative nontoxicity to normal cells as well as in vivo antitumor activity with clinically attainable concentration (10Banerjee S.

The proapoptotic Bcl-2 family members, Bax and Bak, are essential for mediating cytochrome c release, and the loss of either one or both of these components often renders cancers resistant to drugs (13Wei.

Similarly, antiapoptotic Bcl-2 family members like Bcl-2 and Bcl-XL guard the mitochondria by preventing the release of cytochrome c, and a variety of cancers are resistant to drugs subsequent to overexpression of Bcl-2 or Bcl-XL (16Reed J.C.

It is expected that modulators of apoptosis with different mechanisms of action independent of the classical apoptotic signaling cascade may have promising features of bypassing clinical drug resistance caused by impaired apoptotic signaling. Indeed, there are reports of cytochrome c-independent cell death induced by resveratrol that is not completely prevented by Bax deficiency, suggesting the complex nature of death signaling induced by resveratrol (25Tinhofer I.

Opitz-Araya X. Lazebnik Y. Science. 2002; 297: 1352-1354Crossref PubMed Scopus (657) Google Scholar, 30Paroni G. Henderson C. Schneider C. Brancolini C. J. Biol.

Although the mechanisms of caspase-2 activation and its downstream events are not clearly defined, accumulating evidence indicates that caspase-2 primarily acts upstream of mitochondria (31Robertson J.D.

The present investigation was designed to address the precise mode of death signaling of resveratrol upstream of mitochondria with special emphasis on the specific role of caspase-2 and its downstream events. The results suggest that resveratrol induces cell death by both caspase-dependent and caspase-independent routes. The caspase-dependent cell death starts with the activation of caspase-2 that cooperates with Bax/Bak and subsequent mitochondrial amplification by the release of cytochrome c as well as caspase-independent effectors like apoptosis-inducing factor (AIF) 4The abbreviations used are: AIF, apoptosis-inducing factor; MEF, mouse embryonic fibroblasts; CHAPS, 3-[(3-cholamidopropyl)dimethylammonio]-1-propanesulfonic acid; DAPI, 4′,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole; GFP, green fluorescent protein; PMA, phrobol-12-myristate-13-acetate; NAC, N-acetyl-l-cysteine; Z, benzyloxycarbonyl; fmk, fluoromethyl ketone; MTT, 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide; PARP, poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase; RNAi, RNA interference; FITC, fluorescein isothiocyanate; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline; EGFP, enhanced green fluorescent protein; AS, antisense; AFC, 7-amino-4-trifluoromethylcoumarin. 4The abbreviations used are: AIF, apoptosis-inducing factor; MEF, mouse embryonic fibroblasts; CHAPS, 3-[(3-cholamidopropyl)dimethylammonio]-1-propanesulfonic acid; DAPI, 4′,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole; GFP, green fluorescent protein; PMA, phrobol-12-myristate-13-acetate; NAC, N-acetyl-l-cysteine; Z, benzyloxycarbonyl; fmk, fluoromethyl ketone; MTT, 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide; PARP, poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase; RNAi, RNA interference; FITC, fluorescein isothiocyanate; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline; EGFP, enhanced green fluorescent protein; AS, antisense; AFC, 7-amino-4-trifluoromethylcoumarin. and endonuclease G. The absence of both Bax and Bak does not prevent cell death and caspase-3 activation completely in Bax- and Bak-deficient mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEF). This suggests that reseveratrol-induced apoptosis involves caspase-2/caspase-8-mediated processing of downstream caspases independent of cytochrome c.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESCell Lines and Expression Vectors—The human colon adenocarcinoma cell line HCT 116 with one intact Bax allele (Bax+/–) and its Bax-deficient derivative (Bax–/–) were kindly provided by Dr. Bert Vogelstein (32Zhang L.

The rat monoclonal antibody that recognizes mouse caspase-2 (10C6) was from Chemicon.Cytotoxicity and Apoptosis Measurement—Cytotoxicity was assessed by a modified version of the MTT reduction assay (34Rashmi R. Kumar S. Karunagaran D. Carcinogenesis. 2005; 26: 713-723Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). For analyzing chromatin condensation by DAPI staining, the cells were seeded on 12-mm coverslips and, after the indicated treatment, fixed in paraformaldehyde and permeabilized with Triton 0.2%. The monolayer was washed and stained with 0.5 μg/ml DAPI in PBS for 5 min and viewed under a fluorescent microscope using the UV2A filter of an Epifluorescent microscope (Nikon TE 300). Apoptotic nuclei with intense condensed chromatin were scored in percentage from 200–300 cells/sample by at least two investigators.Exposure of phosphatidylserine on the surface of plasma membrane, an important apoptotic marker, was analyzed using annexin V-FITC staining reagent as per standard protocol and viewed under a fluorescent microscope. Intracellular caspase-3 activity was monitored in MEF using cell-permeable fluorogenic peptide-based reagent PhiPhiLux as per instructions and viewed under a fluorescent microscope using a rhodamine filter or under a laser-scanning confocal microscope (TCS SP2; Leica). Fluorescing cells were counted from a total of 300–400 cells/sample to calculate the percentage of cells positive for active caspase-3.Caspase Activity Analysis—The cells after the indicated treatment were lysed with a lysis buffer (150 mm NaCl, 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 0.1% SDS, 1% Nonidet P-40, 0.5% sodium deoxycholate) for 30 min at 4 °C. 50 μg of protein were incubated in assay buffer (100 mm HEPES, pH 7.0, 1 mm EDTA, 0.1% CHAPS, 10% glycerol, 20 mm dithiothreitol) in the presence of 50 μm synthetic tetrapeptide fluorescent substrates for different caspases for 1 h at 37°C. The fluorescence from the released free AFC (excitation wavelength of 405 nm and emission wavelength of 500 nm) and 7-amino-4-methylcoumarin (excitation wavelength of 360 nm and emission wavelength of 460 nm) was determined using spectrofluorimeter (LS-50B; PerkinElmer Life Science Products). The relative fluorescence intensity per mg of protein was compared with respective control to calculate -fold increase from the respective control value.Western Blot—To prepare whole cell extracts for Western blot, cells were harvested, washed three times in PBS, and lysed in radioimmune precipitation lysis buffer (50 mm Tris-Cl (pH 7.4), 1% Nonidet P-40, 40 mm NaF, 10 mm NaCl, 10 mm Na3VO4, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 10 mm dithiothreitol, and 1 μg/ml each leupeptin and aprotinin). The cell lysates (50 μg of protein) were resolved by SDS-PAGE, and the separated proteins were transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride membranes by the wet transfer method using a Bio-Rad electrotransfer apparatus. After blocking with 10% nonfat milk in Tris-buffered saline containing 0.2% Tween 20, the membrane was incubated with the primary antibody, followed by horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibody. Proteins were visualized by 3,3′-diaminobenzidine. For analyzing proteins released from mitochondria into cytosol, the cytosolic fraction was prepared from digitonin-permeabilized cells as per standard protocol. Briefly, the cells (untreated or after treatment) were harvested and washed two times with PBS, and the cell pellet was resuspended in digitonin lysis buffer (75 mm NaCl, 1 mm NaH2PO4, 8 mm Na2HPO4, 250 mm sucrose, 190 μg/ml digitonin) containing protease inhibitors and incubated on ice for 5 min. The releasate was centrifuged at 15,000 rpm at 4 °C for 30 min and used for Western blotting as described above using antibodies to AIF or endonuclease G or cytochrome c and appropriate secondary antibodies.Immunofluorescence and Confocal Imaging—Cells grown on 12-mm glass coverslips in 24-well plates and after drug exposure for different time periods were fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde in PBS. After permeabilization with 0.5% Triton X-100 in PBS for 10 min, the coverslips were incubated with primary antibody followed by fluorescence-labeled secondary antibody. For staining conformational specific Bax and Bak, the cells on coverslips after fixation were permeabilized with 0.0125% CHAPS in order to avoid artifactual epitope exposure (35Hsu Y.T. Youle R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 10777-10783Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (443) Google Scholar). Subsequently, they were incubated with a conformational specific antibody and processed essentially as described above. All of the coverslips were mounted with glycerol and viewed either with a Nikon epifluorescent microscope (Nikon TE300) or imaged using a Leica laser-scanning confocal microscope (TCS SP2) attached to a Leica inverted fluorescent microscope DM IRE2. All images were obtained with 1.3 numerical aperture ×40 Plan Neo Fluor objective. For DsRed, rhodamine, and PhiPhiLux, laser line 543 nm from the helium-neon laser was used, and for GFP/FITC, laser line 488 nm from the argon ion laser was used.Transfection Experiments—HCT 116 cells were transiently transfected with the corresponding expression vectors using Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen) to attain maximum transfection efficiency that ranged between 50 and 70%. The stable cells expressing Bax GFP and Bid DsRed were generated by growing transfected cells in 1 mg/ml of G418 (Invitrogen)-containing medium for 2 months. The resistant clones formed were picked up and analyzed for protein expression. The selected clones were maintained separately with 100 μg/ml G418.NF-κB Reporter Gene Assay—The cells were transiently transfected with NF-κB-Luc vector using Lipofectamine 2000 and after 24 h were exposed to 50 μm hydrogen peroxide (H2O2), 10 nm phorbol-12-myristate-13-acetate (PMA) or 100 mm of N-acetyl-l-cysteine (NAC) alone or along with resveratrol. After 24 h, whole cell extract was prepared, and a luciferase assay was performed using the Dual-Luciferase™ reporter assay system (Promega, Madison, WI) as per the instructions from the manufacturer. Luciferase values were normalized for differences in transfection efficiency on the basis of β-galactosidase activity.Translocation of Bid DsRed, Bax GFP, and p65 EGFP—The transfected cells were seeded onto 8-well-chambered coverglass and allowed to grow for 24 h. After a fixed time of incubation with resveratrol or the indicated treatment, the pattern of fluorescence was monitored under a fluorescent microscope using specific filters and photographed.RESULTSResveratrol-induced Cell Death Involves Processing of Caspase-2, -9, -8, and -3 and Cleavage of PARP and Bid—Exposure of colon cancer cells (HCT 116) to 25, 50, 75, and 100 μm resveratrol induced marked cytotoxicity, as evidenced from the MTT assay in a time- and concentration-dependent manner (Fig. 1A). Changes in chromatin condensation upon resveratrol treatment were then analyzed using DAPI to see whether the observed cytotoxicity is mediated through the induction of apoptosis. Resveratrol did not induce notable changes in nuclear morphology below 25 μm concentration, but at 100 μm for 72 h, it induced massive chromatin condensation in almost 92% of cells and at 48 h in 78% of cells (Fig. 1B). Since 50 μm resveratrol was enough to induce nearly 50% cell death at 48 h, we used this concentration for subsequent experiments.Next, the processing of caspase-2, -9, -3, and -8 was analyzed after incubation of the HCT 116 cells with or without 50 μm resveratrol for 24, 48, and 72 h. All of the caspases analyzed were processed after 24 h of resveratrol treatment, as is evident from the appearance of cleaved fragments of caspase-3, -9, and -8 and loss of the mother band of caspase-2 with time in Western blot experiments (Fig. 1C). Spectrofluorimetric quantitative analysis of enzymatic activity of caspases also substantiates their processing upon resveratrol treatment (Fig. 1C). The nuclear apoptosis, as determined by DAPI staining shows that apoptotic nuclear morphology was noticeable from 24 h of resveratrol treatment. However, by 72 h, nearly 78% cells were apoptotic, consistent with increased activation of caspase-3 and pronounced cleavage of its substrate, PARP, with reseveratrol treatment (Fig. 1D). We also analyzed the cleavage status of a proapoptotic Bcl-2 family protein, Bid, by Western blotting, and the 15-kDa cleavage fragment was generated by 48 h of resveratrol treatment (Fig. 1D).Heat shock proteins are important regulators of apoptosis with a capacity to block caspase processing, and its down-regulation has been reported with a variety of antitumor agents. Hence, we analyzed the expression levels of heat shock proteins 70 and 90 and the heat shock transcription factor, HSF1, with or without resveratrol treatment by Western blotting for the indicated time intervals. Expression levels of heat shock proteins or HSF1 were not altered by resveratrol up to 72 h (Fig. 1E). These results suggest that resveratrol is capable of inducing chromatin condensation and cleavage of PARP primarily through the processing of caspase-2, -9, -3 and -8 without significant changes in heat shock proteins.Resveratrol Induces Release of Cytochrome c, AIF, and Endonuclease G from Mitochondria to Cytosol and Translocation of Bax GFP to Mitochondria in a Time-dependent Manner—The proapoptotic Bcl-2 family proteins, Bax and Bak, are activated by conformational changes that are considered essential for the release of cytochrome c and other apoptosis-enhancing proteins (13Wei.

Med. 2002; 8: 274-281Crossref PubMed Scopus (482) Google Scholar). Immunofluorescent staining of cells treated with resveratrol for 24 h showed that 85 and 92% of them were stained positive for the active forms of Bax and Bak, respectively (Fig. 2A). The control cells stained negative for both active Bax and Bak (Fig. 2A). Bax and Bak can trigger mitochondrial apoptosis by the release of cytochrome c for subsequent caspase processing as well as certain caspase-independent death effectors like AIF and endonuclease G into cytosol (15Wang G.Q. Wieckowski E. Goldstein L.A. Gastman B.R. Rabinovitz A. Gambotto A. Li S. Fang B. Yin X.M. Rabinowich H. J. Exp. Med. 2001; 194: 1325-1337Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). Hence, the release of cytochrome c, AIF, and endonuclease G was analyzed both by Western blotting and immunofluorescent staining in cells treated with or without resveratrol. In Western blot of digitonin-permeabilized cells, cytochrome c was released into cytosol after 24 h of resveratrol treatment, and it gradually increased up to 72 h, whereas the release of AIF and endonuclease G was a delayed event under the same conditions (Fig. 2B). The immunofluorescent staining of cells also shows that after 48 h of resveratrol treatment, almost all of the cells had a cytoplasmic diffuse pattern for cytochrome c, whereas only a few cells had nuclear or cytoplasmic positivity for AIF and endonuclease G (Fig. 2B). The reasons for the differences in the release kinetics of cytochrome c, AIF, and endonuclease G are not clear. The delayed release of AIF and endonuclease G upon resveratrol treatment supports the emerging notion that the release of mitochondrial membrane proteins is regulated differentially, and the release of AIF and endonuclease G requires caspase-processing downstream of cytochrome c release (36Arnoult D.

More intense heat shock, however, induces apoptosis through mechanisms that remain largely unknown. Herein, we present evidence that heat shock activates an apical protease that stimulates mitochondrial outer membrane permeabilization and processing of the effector caspase-3 in a benzyloxycarbonyl-VAD-fluoromethyl ketone (polycaspase inhibitor)- and Bcl-2-inhibitable manner. Surprisingly, however, neither FADD·caspase-8 nor RAIDD·caspase-2 PIDDosome (p53-induced protein with a death domain) complexes were detected in dying cells, and neither of these initiator caspases nor the endoplasmic reticulum stress-activated caspases-4/12 were required for mitochondrial outer membrane permeabilization. Similarly, although cytochrome c was released from mitochondria following heat shock, functional Apaf-1·caspase-9 apoptosome complexes were not formed, and caspase-9 was not essential for the activation of caspase-3 or the induction of apoptosis. Thus, heat shock does not require any of the known initiator caspases or their activating complexes to promote apoptotic cell death but instead relies upon the activation of an apparently novel apical protease with caspase-like activity.

Thus, heat shock does not require any of the known initiator caspases or their activating complexes to promote apoptotic cell death but instead relies upon the activation of an apparently novel apical protease with caspase-like activity. Two pathways, referred to as the death receptor (extrinsic) and mitochondrial (intrinsic) pathways, are widely regarded as being responsible for most, if not all, caspase-dependent apoptosis (1Jiang X. Wang X. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2004; 73: 87-106Crossref PubMed Scopus (1138) Google Scholar, 2Danial N.N. Korsmeyer S.J. Cell. 2004; 116: 205-219Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (4060) Google Scholar). In both cases, caspase cascades are initiated through formation of a protein complex that contains a specific adapter protein and its associated “initiator” caspase (i.e. caspase-2, -8, -9, -10, or -12) (3Boatright K.M. Salvesen G.S. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 2003; 15: 725-731Crossref PubMed Scopus (1084) Google Scholar). Once activated, most initiator caspases proteolytically activate the downstream “effector” caspases-3, -6, and/or -7, which in turn cleave specific cellular substrates resulting in chromatin compaction, membrane blebbing, and cell shrinkage. Stimulation of death receptors (such as CD95 and tumor necrosis factor (TNF) 3The abbreviations used are: TNF, tumor necrosis factor; MOMP, mitochondrial outer membrane permeabilization; Z-VAD-fmk, benzyloxycarbonyl-VAD-fluoromethyl ketone; FADD, Fas-associated death domain; PIDD, p53-induced protein with a death domain; RAIDD, RIP-associated ICH-1/CED-3-homologous protein with a death domain; Apaf-1, apoptotic protease-activating factor-1; Hsp, heat shock protein; MEF, mouse embryonic fibroblast; JNK, c-Jun NH2-terminal kinase; PS, phosphatidylserine; TMRE, tetramethylrhodamine ethyl ester; PI, propidium iodide; Smac, second mitochondrial activator of caspases; IAP, inhibitor of apoptosis protein. receptor 1) with their cognate ligands or agonistic antibodies induces receptor aggregation and formation of a “death-inducing signaling complex” (4Walczak H. Krammer P.H. Exp. Cell Res. 2000; 256: 58-66Crossref PubMed Scopus (552) Google Scholar). Although important differences exist among the various death receptor complexes, they all utilize the adapter protein Fas-associated death domain (FADD) to recruit and induce a conformational change in caspase-8 (and -10), which results in its activation and autoprocessing (induced proximity model) (3Boatright K.M. Salvesen G.S. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 2003; 15: 725-731Crossref PubMed Scopus (1084) Google Scholar). In so-called type I cells, it is thought that death receptor stimulation activates sufficient amounts of caspase-8 within the death-inducing signaling complex so as to efficiently activate caspase-3 and execute the apoptotic program. In contrast, in type II cells, such as Jurkat T cells, caspase-8 indirectly mediates caspase-3 activation by first cleaving and activating the proapoptotic Bcl-2 family member Bid (5Barnhart B.C. Alappat E.C. Peter M.E. Semin. Immunol. 2003; 15: 185-193Crossref PubMed Scopus (378) Google Scholar). Similar to Bid, other BH3-only proteins, such as Bim, Puma, etc., serve as “stress sensors” that initiate the mitochondrial pathway to apoptosis by either inhibiting anti-apoptotic Bcl-2 family members (e.g. Bcl-2 and Bcl-xL) and/or directly activating the pro-apoptotic Bcl-2 family members Bax or Bak (2Danial N.N. Korsmeyer S.J. Cell. 2004; 116: 205-219Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (4060) Google Scholar). These actions trigger mitochondrial outer membrane permeabilization (MOMP), which is arguably the defining moment in the intrinsic pathway, as it leads to the release of cytochrome c from the intermembrane space into the cytoplasm (1Jiang X. Wang X. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2004; 73: 87-106Crossref PubMed Scopus (1138) Google Scholar). Cytochrome c then binds to apoptotic protease-activating factor-1 (Apaf-1) and, in the presence of dATP or ATP, stimulates oligomerization of Apaf-1 into a large heptameric apoptosome complex (1Jiang X. Wang X. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2004; 73: 87-106Crossref PubMed Scopus (1138) Google Scholar). The apical caspase-9 is subsequently recruited to the apoptosome, where it undergoes activation and autocatalytic processing at Asp-315 to produce p35/p12 caspase-9. Importantly, once activated, the effector caspase-3 can also participate in the processing of procaspase-9 at Asp-330 through a feedback loop to generate p37/p10 caspase-9 (6Srinivasula S.M. Ahmad M. Fernandes-Alnemri T. Alnemri E.S. Mol. Cell. 1998; 1: 949-957Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (969) Google Scholar). Recently, it has been suggested that, upstream of mitochondria, other forms of cellular stress may induce the formation of distinct caspase-activating complexes. For example, following DNA damage, caspase-2 is reportedly activated within a large molecular weight complex containing the adapter protein RAIDD and the p53-inducible scaffold protein PIDD (7Tinel A. Tschopp J. Science. 2004; 304: 843-846Crossref PubMed Scopus (546) Google Scholar). Caspase-2 is the most archaic of the mammalian caspases, exhibiting features of both initiator and effector caspases; however, it appears unable to efficiently activate the effector caspase-3 (8Guo Y. Srinivasula S.M. Druilhe A. Fernandes-Alnemri T. Alnemri E.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 13430-13437Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (450) Google Scholar). Thus, caspase-2 stimulates MOMP either directly or indirectly through cleavage of Bid and relies upon the Apaf-1 apoptosome to activate effector caspases and induce apoptosis (8Guo Y. Srinivasula S.M. Druilhe A. Fernandes-Alnemri T. Alnemri E.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 13430-13437Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (450) Google Scholar, 9Robertson J.D. Gogvadze V.

Science. 2002; 297: 1352-1354Crossref PubMed Scopus (660) Google Scholar). Endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress likewise may induce the formation of a complex containing the ER transmembrane kinase IRE1 and TRAF2 (TNF receptor-associated factor 2), which in turn recruits and activates the apical caspase-12 (11Yoneda T. Imaizumi K. Oono K. Yui D. Gomi F. Katayama T. Tohyama M. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 13935-13940Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (701) Google Scholar). Alternatively, caspase-12 may also be processed by calpains, which are often activated by calcium during ER stress (12Nakagawa T. Yuan J. J. Cell Biol. 2000; 150: 887-894Crossref PubMed Scopus (1044) Google Scholar). Active caspase-12 may then activate caspase-9 independently of the Apaf-1 apoptosome, which in turn activates the effector caspases -3 and -7 (13Rao R.V. Castro-Obregon S. Frankowski H. Schuler M. Stoka V. del Rio G. Bredesen D.E. Ellerby H.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 21836-21842Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (438) Google Scholar). However, the caspase-12 gene is not expressed in the vast majority of humans because of a premature stop codon. Thus, it has been proposed that caspase-4 may substitute for caspase-12 in man. Indeed, caspase-4 is cleaved upstream of mitochondria in Bcl-2- or Bcl-xL-overexpressing cells, but similar to caspase-2, it must engage the intrinsic pathway to induce apoptotic cell death (14Hitomi J. Katayama T. Eguchi Y. Kudo T. Taniguchi M. Koyama Y. Manabe T. Yamagishi S. Bando Y. Imaizumi K. Tsujimoto Y. Tohyama M. J. Cell Biol. 2004; 165: 347-356Crossref PubMed Scopus (746) Google Scholar). Responses to heat shock are among the most highly conserved and important in nature. Consequently, numerous studies have focused on how uni- and multicellular organisms cope with this common stress (15Jolly C. Morimoto R.I. J. Natl. Cancer Inst. 2000; 92: 1564-1572Crossref PubMed Scopus (879) Google Scholar). Previous work makes it clear that up-regulation of various heat shock proteins (Hsps), including Hsp-70 and to a lesser extent Hsp-27 and Hsp-90, represents an adaptive response that can protect cells from subsequent pro-apoptotic stimuli. However, far fewer studies have rigorously examined the mechanism(s) by which heat shock induces cell death. In this study, we have demonstrated that intense heat shock induces caspase-dependent apoptosis but does so via mechanisms that do not involve any of the established initiator caspase-activating complexes and thus may represent an archaic and novel pathway to cell death. Cell Lines—E6.1, neo/Bcl-2, A3, caspase-8-deficient, and FADD-deficient Jurkat T cell strains were grown in RPMI 1640 medium, supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum, 2 mm glutamine, 1% penicillin/streptomycin, and for neo/Bcl-2 overexpressors, G418. Ras/Myc-transformed apaf-1–/– and caspase-9–/– mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs), primary wild-type and caspase-2–/– MEFs, and transformed caspase-12–/– MEFs were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum, 2 mm glutamine, and 1% penicillin/streptomycin. All cells were grown in a humidified atmosphere of 5% CO2 in air at 37 °C. Cell Death Treatments—Cells were challenged with the DNA-damaging agents etoposide (60 μm) or cisplatin (100 μm); the kinase inhibitor staurosporine (250 nm); the translation inhibitor and p38/JNK activator anisomycin (25 μm); the lysomotropic agent Leu-Leu methyl ester (25 μm); the ER stress agents brefeldin A (500 nm) or thapsigargin (500 nm); or the death receptor ligands anti-CD95 (CH-11, 100 ng/ml, Upstate Biotechnology), TNF-related apoptosis-inducing ligand (TRAIL) (1.0–1.6 μg/ml), or a combination of TNF (300 ng/ml) and cycloheximide (2 μg/ml). Cells treated with heat shock were incubated at 45 °C for 2 h followed by post-heat shock incubation at 37 °C for 4 h, unless otherwise indicated. All of the treatments were performed in cell culture incubators with a humidified atmosphere of 5% CO2. To inhibit protease-dependent cell death, cells were preincubated for 1 h with Z-VAD(OMe)-fmk (40 μm; BioMol), Z-VDVAD(OMe)-fmk (40 μm; Tocris Biosciences), Ac-DEVD-CHO (150 μm; BioMol), Ac-YVAD-CHO (150 μm; BioMol), PD150606 (10–80 μm; Calbiochem), or Z-VF-CHO (10–80 μm; Calbiochem) prior to treatment. Flow Cytometric Detection of Inner Mitochondrial Transmembrane Potential (Δψm) and Cell Death—Phosphatidylserine (PS) exposure and propidium iodide (PI) staining was determined as previously described (16Sun X.M. Bratton S.B. Butterworth M. MacFarlane M. Cohen G.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 11345-11351Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (203) Google Scholar). Changes in Δψm were measured by staining cells with tetramethylrhodamine ethyl ester (TMRE, 120 nm; Molecular Probes) at 37 °C for 10 min. After staining, the cells were immediately analyzed by flow cytometry (EPICS XL, Beckman-Coulter). Fluorimetric Assay for Caspase Activity—For in vitro assays, cell lysates were prepared and activated by adding cytochrome c (10 μm), dATP (2 mm), and MgCl2 (2 mm) (17Cain K. Bratton S.B. Langlais C. Walker G. Brown D.G. Sun X.M. Cohen G.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 6067-6070Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (292) Google Scholar). To assess caspase-3 activity in treated cells, 2 × 106 cells were resuspended in 50 μl of digitonin lysis buffer (80 mm KCl, 1 mm NaH2PO4·H2O, 8 mm Na2HPO4, 250 mm sucrose, 60 μg/ml digitonin) for 5 min on ice. The cells were then spun at 14,000 × g for 10 min. All samples were then assayed for caspase-3 DEVDase activity using the fluorescent peptide substrate DEVD-7-amino-4-methylcoumarin, as previously described (17Cain K. Bratton S.B. Langlais C. Walker G. Brown D.G. Sun X.M. Cohen G.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 6067-6070Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (292) Google Scholar). Western Blot Analysis—Whole cell, cytosolic, and pellet fractions were normalized according to cell number and were boiled in SDS sample buffer (40 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 5% glycerol, 5% β-mercaptoethanol, 2% SDS, 0.05% bromphenol blue) prior to gel loading. All protein samples were resolved on 10–15% SDS-polyacrylamide gels, transferred to nitrocellulose (Hybond, Amersham Biosciences) and immunoblotted using one of the following primary antibodies: rabbit anti-caspase-1 (p10, Santa Cruz Biotechnology), mouse anti-caspase-2 (clone 35, BD Transduction Laboratories), rabbit anti-caspases -3, -7, -8, -9, and Smac (generously provided by Dr. X.-M. Sun and Prof. G. M. Cohen, Medical Research Council, Toxicology Unit, Leicester, UK), mouse anti-caspase-4 (clone 4B9, MBL), rabbit anti-cleaved caspase-6 (Cell Signaling Technology), mouse anti-caspase-8 (clone 1C12, Cell Signaling Technology), mouse anti-caspase-10 (clone 4C1, Medical Biological Laboratories), rabbit anti-Apaf-1 (Pharmingen), and mouse anti-cytochrome c (clone 7H8.2C12, Pharmingen). RNA Interference—Jurkat T cells (107 cells) were transfected by electroporation with 16 μg of double-stranded RNA oligonucleotides (Dharmacon) targeted against a luciferase control sequence (siCtrl: 5′-AA-CTTACGCTGAGTACT TCGA-dTdT-3′) or a previously verified caspase-2 sequence (siC2–510: 5′-AA-CTTCCAGCTGGC ATATAGG-dTdT-3′) (18Wilkinson J.C.

Chem. 2004; 279: 35047-35052Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). After 24 h, viable cells were purified using a Ficoll-Paque density gradient and replated at 106 cells/ml in fresh medium for an additional 24 h prior to treatment (18Wilkinson J.C. Cepero E. Boise L.H. Duckett C.S. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2004; 24: 7003-7014Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). Gel Filtration Studies—Cell lysates were prepared from control or apoptotic cells and fractionated by size exclusion chromatography using a fast protein liquid chromatography protein purification system with a Superose-6 HR 10/30 column (Amersham Biosciences), as previously described (17Cain K. Bratton S.B. Langlais C. Walker G. Brown D.G. Sun X.M. Cohen G.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 6067-6070Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (292) Google Scholar). Fractions were subsequently mixed with 5× loading buffer, resolved by SDS-PAGE, and immunoblotted with a rabbit polyclonal antibody to PIDD (Alexis Biochemicals) or mouse monoclonal antibodies to RAIDD (clone 4B12, MBL) or caspase-2 (clone 35, BD Transduction Laboratories). Heat Shock Induces a Unique Caspase Processing Profile That Culminates in Apoptosis—In our initial experiments, we noted that diverse pro-apoptotic stimuli, including DNA damaging agents, Ser/Thr kinase inhibitors, p38/JNK activators, death receptor ligands, lysomotropic agents and ER stressors, stimulated time-dependent cleavage of caspase-9 at both Asp-315 (p35 caspase-9) and Asp-330 (p37 caspase-9) (Fig. 1A), whereas heat shock induced processing almost entirely at Asp-330 (Fig. 1B). Because cleavage of caspase-9 at Asp-315 and Asp-330 is generally mediated by the Apaf-1 apoptosome and the effector caspase-3, respectively (6Srinivasula S.M. Ahmad M. Fernandes-Alnemri T. Alnemri E.S. Mol. Cell. 1998; 1: 949-957Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (969) Google Scholar), the data suggested that caspase-9 cleavage following heat shock was not mediated by the apoptosome but was instead a relatively late caspase-3-dependent event. In subsequent dose-response experiments, heat shock induced a steady increase in the activation of caspase-3 between 42 and 45 °C, which correlated with the formation of p37 caspase-9 and the amount of apoptosis (Fig. 1C, lanes 2–5). However, as previously observed, there was little evidence for the formation of p35 caspase-9 at any temperature. Therefore, our results suggested that heat shock might utilize an apical caspase other than caspase-9 to initiate its caspase cascade and promote apoptosis. In an effort to determine the importance of caspases for heat shock-induced apoptosis, as well as the sequential order of caspase activation, we next examined heat-shocked cells pretreated with either the polycaspase inhibitor Z-VAD-fmk or the caspase-3/7 selective inhibitor DEVD-CHO (20Garcia-Calvo M. Peterson E.P. Leiting B. Ruel R. Nicholson D.W. Thornberry N.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 32608-32613Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (849) Google Scholar). Heat shock alone initiated the activation of all apoptosis-related caspases (i.e. caspases -2, -3, -6, -7, -8, and -9), except for caspase-10, and induced ∼50% apoptosis by 6 h, all of which was prevented by Z-VAD-fmk (Fig. 2A, lanes 1–3; Fig. 2B, left panels). Next, by carefully titrating DEVD-CHO, we established a concentration of this inhibitor, which did not prevent the initial processing of procaspase-3 to its intermediate p20 form (i.e. did not inhibit the apical protease responsible for cleaving procaspase-3 at Asp-175) but totally inhibited the subsequent autocatalytic conversion of caspase-3 from its p20 to its p19/17 forms (Fig. 2A, lane 4). In this context, selective inhibition of caspase-3 also prevented cleavage of a number of direct caspase-3 substrates, including poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase, caspase-6, and as predicted above, caspase-9 (Fig. 2A, lane 4). To our surprise, however, DEVD-CHO also prevented the processing of the remaining initiator caspases -2 and -8 (Fig. 2A, lane 4). Thus, our initial studies with pharmacological caspase inhibitors suggested that heat shock induced the activation of caspase-3 via a Z-VAD-fmk-inhibitable protease. This apical protease, however, did not appear to be any of the known classical initiator caspases, as they were all processed downstream of caspase-3. Heat Shock Activates an Apical Protease Capable of Inducing MOMP and a Loss in Δψm—Inhibition of the apical protease with Z-VAD-fmk not only prevented the activation of caspase-3 but also inhibited MOMP (e.g. mitochondrial release of cytochrome c or Smac into the cytoplasm) as well as cell death up to 24 h following heat shock (Fig. 2A, lanes 2 and 3; Fig. 2B, left panels) (supplemental Fig. S1). By contrast, inhibition of caspase-3 with DEVD-CHO did not significantly inhibit cytochrome c release but did partially inhibit Smac release or more likely inhibited its degradation by the proteasome (21Sun X.M. Butterworth M. MacFarlane M. Dubiel W. Ciechanover A. Cohen G.M. Mol. Cell. 2004; 14: 81-93Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (168) Google Scholar). DEVD-CHO also failed to inhibit the overall amount of heat shock-induced cell death but did promote a shift in the mode of cell death from apoptosis (PS+) to necrosis (PS–PI+) (Fig. 2A, lane 4; Fig. 2B, left panels). Therefore, collectively, these results indicated 1) that the heat-activated apical protease was responsible for inducing MOMP and 2) that downstream caspase-3 activity was required for execution of the apoptotic program, but in its absence, cells nevertheless died by necrosis because of severe mitochondrial injury brought on by the apical protease. DEVD-CHO also failed to prevent a loss in Δψm following heat shock (Fig. 2B, right panels). This result was somewhat surprising given that caspase-3 is thought to be primarily responsible for triggering reductions in Δψm by cleaving and inactivating NDUFS1, a complex I component of the mitochondrial respiratory chain (22Ricci J.E. Munoz-Pinedo C. Fitzgerald P. Bailly-Maitre B. Perkins G.A. Yadava N. Scheffler I.E. Ellisman M.H. Green D.R. Cell. 2004; 117: 773-786Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (494) Google Scholar). Thus, the heat shock-activated apical protease could induce a loss in Δψm via caspase-3-independent mechanisms. Heat Shock Induces Apoptosis Independently of the Apaf-1·Caspase-9 Apoptosome—Although processing of caspase-9 appeared to be a relatively downstream event, as already noted, cytochrome c was released during heat shock-induced apoptosis (Fig. 2A, lane 2). Therefore, in an effort to determine whether heat shock inhibited the formation and/or activity of the Apaf-1 apoptosome, we fractionated lysates from control and heat-shocked cells (by Superose-6 gel filtration chromatography) and compared them with naïve lysates activated with cytochrome c and dATP (cytochrome c/dATP). Heat shock induced partial oligomerization of Apaf-1 into large molecular weight complexes (∼700 kDa), which were similar in size to those apoptosome complexes formed in cytochrome c/dATP-activated lysates (Fig. 3A, fractions 8–12). However, caspase-9 was not recruited to the Apaf-1 complex nor was there any evidence for apoptosome-dependent processing of caspase-9 at Asp-315 (data not shown; Figs. 1 and 2A). We considered the possibility that recruitment of caspase-9 might be inhibited by Hsp-70 or Hsp-90, because both are up-regulated in response to sublethal exposures to heat shock, and both reportedly inhibit the apoptosome (23Beere H.M. Wolf B.B. Cain K. Mosser D.D. Mahboubi A. Kuwana T. Tailor P. Morimoto R.I. Cohen G.M. Green D.R. Nat. Cell Biol. 2000; 2: 469-475Crossref PubMed Scopus (1295) Google Scholar). However, following a lethal exposure to heat shock, there was no increase in the expression of either Hsp-70 (Fig. 2A, lanes 1–2) or Hsp-90 at 6 h (data not shown). Moreover, pretreatment of cells with the global translation inhibitor cycloheximide did not potentiate (nor did it inhibit) heat shock-induced MOMP, caspase-3 activation, or apoptosis (supplemental Fig. S2). Despite the evidence against the involvement of the Apaf-1 apoptosome in heat shock-induced apoptosis, it remained plausible that an undetectable amount of p35 caspase-9, activated within the apoptosome, might process small amounts of caspase-3 and initiate a robust caspase amplification loop. We therefore examined both apaf-1–/– and caspase-9–/– MEFs for their apoptotic responses to heat shock, as well as to tumor necrosis factor-α/cycloheximide (24Soengas M.S. Alarcon R.M. Yoshida H. Giaccia A.J. Hakem R. Mak T.W. Lowe S.W. Science. 1999; 284: 156-159Crossref PubMed Scopus (596) Google Scholar). Heat shock triggered MOMP (loss of cytochrome c from mitochondria) and apoptosis in both the Apaf-1 and caspase-9-deficient MEFs and importantly, caused a time-dependent increase in caspase-3-like DEVDase activity (Fig. 3, B and C). Using an antibody that recognizes only the processed forms of caspase-3, we confirmed that caspase-3 was activated within 4 h of heat shock. TNF, which stimulates the formation of initiator FADD·caspase-8 complexes, likewise activated caspase-3 (Fig. 3, B and C). We subsequently confirmed the phenotype of the Apaf-1- and caspase-9-deficient cells by incubating them with cytochrome c/dATP. As expected, neither Apaf-1 nor caspase-9-deficient lysates could independently support cytochrome c/dATP-dependent activation of caspases -9 and -3 but readily did so when combined (50:50 mix) prior to activation (supplemental Fig. S3). Thus, functionally active apoptosome complexes were not formed in response to heat shock, but more importantly, were not essential for heat shock-induced MOMP, caspase-3 activation, or cell death. Heat Shock Does Not Utilize ER Stress-activated Caspases to Induce Apoptosis—Given that heat can induce protein misfolding, we speculated that heat shock might induce apoptosis through an ER stress pathway. ER stress reportedly induces apoptosis independently of the apoptosome by activating the apical caspase-12 (mouse), or possibly caspase-4 (human), both of which are localized to the outer ER membrane (11Yoneda T.

Nevertheless, neither caspase-4 nor caspase-1 (another pro-inflammatory caspase) were expressed in our Jurkat T cell model (Fig. 4A), and YVAD-CHO, which potently inhibits both caspases (20Garcia-Calvo M.

Chem. 1998; 273: 32608-32613Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (849) Google Scholar), failed to prevent heat shock-induced MOMP, caspase activation, or cell death (Fig. 2A, lane 5). Consistent with these results, caspase-12-deficient MEFs also displayed no defects in their ability to undergo MOMP or activate caspase-3 following heat shock (Fig. 4B). Moreover, although calpains are thought to activate ER-associated caspases, neither PD150605 nor Z-VF-CHO, two distinct mechanism-based calpain inhibitors, inhibited the activation of caspases or prevented apoptosis (Fig. 4C). Therefore, although heat shock likely induces protein misfolding, it did not utilize caspases -1, -4, -12, or calpains to induce apoptosis. Bcl-2 Inhibits Heat Shock-induced MOMP and Cell Death, but Does Not Prevent the Upstream Processing of Procaspase-3—Z-VAD-fmk clearly inhibited an apical protease responsible for heat shock-induced MOMP. However, it remained unclear whether MOMP was required for the activation of caspase-3 (e.g. by stimulating the release of a factor from mitochondria other than cytochrome c, which led to the activation of caspase-3) or whether the apical protease simultaneously activated caspase-3 upstream of mitochondria. To address these questions, we utilized cells stably transfected with Bcl-2 (a potent inhibitor of MOMP) and reasoned that if the apical protease could directly process procaspase-3 upstream of mitochondria, then Bcl-2 should not entirely prevent this cleavage from occurring. In fact, as previously demonstrated, Bcl-2 prevented MOMP and cell death induced by the agonistic CD95 antibody CH-11 but did not inhibit the initial caspase-8-dependent processing of procaspase-3 to its intermediate p20 form (Fig. 5, lanes 16 and 18) (16Sun X.M. Bratton S.B. Butterworth M. MacFarlane M. Cohen G.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 11345-11351Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (203) Google Scholar). Similarly, Bcl-2 inhibited heat shock-induced MOMP, as well as cell death, but did not prevent (although it delayed) the initial processing of procaspase-3 to its p20 form (Fig. 5, lane 12). In each instance, Bcl-2 likely prevented the autocatalytic conversion of caspase-3 from its p20 to its fully mature p17 form, because it inhibited the release of Smac from mitochondria (Fig. 5, lanes 12, 16 and 18) and thus preserved the inhibition of p20 caspase-3 by IAPs (16Sun X.M. Bratton S.B. Butterworth M. MacFarlane M. Cohen G.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 11345-11351Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (203) Google Scholar). Indeed, the addition of recombinant Smac to lysates prepared from heat-shocked Bcl-2-overexpressing cells resulted in increased caspase-3 DEVDase activity relative to non-treated cells (supplemental Fig. S4) (16Sun X.M.

In human lung, spleen, and ovary and in a lung epithelial cell line (BEAS-2B), cPLA2β is expressed as a 100-kDa protein, not the 114-kDa form originally predicted. Using RNA interference, the 100-kDa protein in BEAS-2B cells was confirmed to be cPLA2β. BEAS-2B cells contain three different RNA splice variants of cPLA2β (β1, β2, and β3). cPLA2β1 is identical to the previously cloned cPLA2β, predicted to encode a 114-kDa protein. However, cPLA2β2 and cPLA2β3 splice variants are smaller and contain internal deletions in the catalytic domain. The 100-kDa cPLA2β in BEAS-2B cells is the translated product of cPLA2β3. cPLA2β3 exhibits calcium-dependent PLA2 activity against palmitoyl-arachidonyl-phosphatidylethanolamine and low level lysophospholipase activity but no activity against phosphatidylcholine. Unlike Group IVA cPLA2α, cPLA2β3 is constitutively bound to membrane in unstimulated cells, localizing to mitochondria and early endosomes. cPLA2β3 is widely expressed in tissues, suggesting that it has a generalized function at these unique sites.

They execute diverse functions, such as digestion of dietary phospholipids, microbial degradation, membrane remodeling, and production of lipid mediators. Traditionally, PLA2s are grouped depending on their active site residues, requirements for calcium, and localization in the cell. Three main classes of PLA2s are Group VI intracellular calcium-independent PLA2s, low molecular weight secreted PLA2s, and Group IV cytosolic PLA2s (1Leslie C.C. Prostaglandins Leukot. Essent.

Group IVA cytosolic PLA2α has received special attention, because it is the only PLA2 that selectively hydrolyzes arachidonic acid from the sn-2 position of membrane phospholipids (1Leslie C.C.

The original finding of abundant unspliced message raised questions about the presence of splice variants. Importantly, the endogenous protein expressed in cells has not been identified, which is the focus of this study. We found that three cPLA2β splice variants (cPLA2β1, cPLA2β2, and cPLA2β3) are present in human lung epithelial cells (BEAS-2B), but only cPLA2β3, which contains a C-terminal internal deletion, is translated to a 100-kDa protein. No evidence for the translation of the originally cloned cPLA2β mRNA was found in cells or human tissues. In this study, we also characterize the enzymatic activities, membrane binding properties, and subcellular localization of cPLA2β3.

Cloning of cPLA2β Splice Variants from BEAS-2B Cells—BEAS-2B cells were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (high glucose) with 10% fetal bovine serum and 1% penicillin/streptomycin/glutamine. To clone cPLA2β splice variants from BEAS-2B cells, total RNA was isolated, and 1 μg was used to generate cDNA. PCR analysis was performed using 10 μl of cDNA for cPLA2β and 5 μl of cDNA for glyceraldehyde phosphate dehydrogenase following the manufacturer's instructions (Clontech Advantage reverse transcription-PCR kit). Specific primers for human cPLA2β are as follows: 5′-gacgcagccatggcggaggcggctttg-3′, 5′-ctggtggcccgggagctctcctgcttg-3′, 5′-caagcaggagagctcccgggccaccag-3′, 5′-ctgcagcggtaccggcaggagctggc-3′, 5′-gccagctcctgccggtaccgctgcag-3′,5′-gccacctgagcccgaggctctgaag-3′. These primers were designed based on the sequence of human cPLA2β (accession number AF065215) to amplify the full-length cDNA in three fragments. The PCR products were cloned into the TA cloning vector, and the fragments were sequenced and then assembled into the full-length clones (cPLA2β1, cPLA2β2, and cPLA2β3) using the internal restriction sites present in the PCR products. Production of Recombinant cPLA2β and cPLA2β Antibodies—Human cPLA2β clone (designated cPLA2β1 in this study) (GenBank™ accession number AF065215) was generously provided by Dr. R. Todd Pickard (Lilly) and subcloned into the baculovirus expression vectors pAcGHLT and pAcHLT in the StyI/NotI sites. Endogenous cPLA2β3 cDNA was cloned into pAcHLT in the NotI/BglII sites. Sf9 cells were grown in suspension at 27 °C in TNF-FH medium as previously described (28Stewart A. Ghosh M. Spencer D.M. Leslie C.C. J. Biol.

Recombinant baculovirus was generated by co-transfection of Sf9 cells with cPLA2β constructs and linearized baculovirus DNA (Baculogold) following the manufacturer's instructions (BD Biosciences Pharmingen). Recombinant virus was generated and amplified by standard protocols. To determine expression of cPLA2βs, Sf9 cells were plated in a 12-well tissue culture plate at a density of 0.5 × 106 cells/well and were infected with recombinant virus at different multiplicities of infection for 1 h. The virus-containing medium was replaced with fresh medium, and cells were incubated for 48 h. Expression of GST-cPLA2β1, His6-cPLA2β1, and His6-cPLA2β3 proteins was determined by Western blot analysis using anti-GST or anti-His monoclonal antibodies. GST-cPLA2β1, His6-cPLA2β1, and His6-cPLA2β3 expressed in Sf9 cells were affinity-purified using glutathione-agarose beads or nickel-agarose beads following the manufacturer's instructions. The concentration of cPLA2β enzymes in eluted fractions was determined by comparing the intensity of Coomassie-stained bands of cPLA2βs on SDS-polyacrylamide gels with a standard curve made with BSA. For mammalian expression, full-length cPLA2β cDNAs were cloned into the pcDNA 3.1 vector in the NheI/NotI sites or into the pcDNA3.1-His vector in the NotI/XbaI sites. To generate polyclonal antibody to full-length cPLA2β1, affinity-purified GST-cPLA2β1 (50–100 μg) in complete Freund's adjuvant was injected subcutaneously into rabbits. Subsequent booster injections were carried out every 3 weeks using Freund's incomplete adjuvant. Antiserum was obtained 10 days following each injection and analyzed for cross-reactivity to cPLA2β1 by Western blotting. To generate anti-peptide antibodies, the peptide (LTEEGTFKVVDEEAMEK) corresponding to a unique sequence between the truncated JmjC domain and the C2 domain of human cPLA2β1 and peptides corresponding to the extreme C terminus of the predicted amino acid sequences (DYNLHGAFQGSGGHPRRRQLGR) and (EALRQAVQRRRQRRPH) of cPLA2β2 and cPLA2β3, respectively, were synthesized. Peptides conjugated to keyhole limpet hemocyanin carrier protein were used to produce rabbit polyclonal antibodies (Quality Control Biochemicals, Hopkinton, MA). Western Blot Analysis—Cells were lysed in buffer containing 50 mm Hepes, pH 7.4, 150 mm sodium chloride, 1.5 mm magnesium chloride, 10% glycerol, 1% Triton X-100, 1 mm EGTA, 200 μm sodium vanadate, 10 mm tetrasodium pyrophosphate, 100 mm sodium fluoride, 300 mm p-nitrophenyl phosphate, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 10 μg/ml leupeptin, and 10 μg/ml aprotinin. Lysates were centrifuged at 15,000 rpm for 15 min, and the protein concentration of the supernatant was determined by the bicinchoninic acid method. Lysates were boiled in Laemmli buffer, and 20–30 μg of total protein per lane was separated on a 10% SDS-polyacrylamide gel. Proteins were transferred onto a nitrocellulose membrane, and the membrane was blocked in Tris-buffered saline containing 0.25% Tween 20, 3% BSA, and 5% nonfat dried milk. Nitrocellulose membranes were incubated overnight at 4 °C with a 1:2500 dilution of cPLA2β1 antibody or a 1:1000 dilution of anti-peptide antibodies. Immunoreactive proteins were detected using the Amersham Biosciences ECL system. Determination of cPLA2β Localization in Soluble and Particulate Fractions of BEAS-2B Cells—BEAS-2B cells were plated in a 6-well plate (1 × 105 cells/well) and transiently transfected with untagged cPLA2β1 in the pcDNA3.1 vector using Fugene 6 transfection reagent. After 24 h of transfection, control and transfected cells were sonicated on ice in homogenization buffer containing 10 mm Hepes, pH 7.4, 0.34 m sucrose, 1 mm EGTA, 10% glycerol, 10 μg/ml leupeptin, 10 μg/ml aprotinin, and 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride with or without 5 mm CaCl2. Homogenates were centrifuged at 100,000 × g for 1 h at 4 °C to obtain the soluble and particulate fractions. Protein concentration was determined, and the relative amount of cPLA2β in each fraction was measured by Western blotting. Knockdown of Endogenous cPLA2β by RNA Interference—BEAS-2B cells were plated in a 12-well plate (0.5 × 105 cells/well) in 1 ml of Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 10% fetal bovine serum and incubated overnight at 37 °C with 5% CO2. Cells at 50–60% confluence were transfected with different concentrations of SMART pool siRNA made against human cPLA2β1 (Refseq number NM_005090). MIRUS Trans IT-TKO transfection reagent was used to transfect siRNA and nontargeting control siRNA following the manufacturer's protocol (Mirus, Madison, WI). Cells were lysed 48 h post-transfection, and relative intensities of cPLA2β protein were determined by Western blotting. Homology Model of cPLA2β3—A homology model of cPLA2β3was made using the x-ray structure of cPLA2α (Protein Data Bank number 1CJY) as the template (12Dessen A. Tang J. Schmidt H. Stahl M. Clark J.D. Seehra J. Somers W.S. Cell. 1999; 97: 349-360Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (301) Google Scholar). cPLA2α and cPLA2β3 amino acid sequences were first aligned with the ClustalW program. The model was made using the homology module of the InsightII software package (Accelrys Corp.). For segments of the cPLA2α protein that align to segments of cPLA2β3, the cPLA2α residues were replaced with the corresponding cPLA2β3 residues. No attempt was made to include cPLA2β3 inserts (those segments that do not align to cPLA2α segments). Enzyme Assays—PLA2 activity of cPLA2βs was assayed using 1-palmitoyl-2-[14C]arachidonyl-PC or 1-palmitoyl-2-[14C]arachidonyl-PE as substrates. The reaction mixture (50-μl final volume) contained 30 μm phospholipid substrate (100,000 dpm/1.5 nmol) and 9 μm dioleoylglycerol (which was co-sonicated with the substrate). To prepare substrate, solvents were evaporated from the lipid mixture under a stream of nitrogen, 50 mm Hepes buffer, pH 7.4, was added, and the lipid mixture was sonicated at 4 °C for 10 s on ice using a microprobe (Braun Instruments) to form small unilamellar vesicles. A final concentration of 150 mm sodium chloride, 1 mg/ml fatty acid-free BSA, 1 mm EGTA, and 5 mm CaCl2 was added to the vesicles. Reactions were started by the addition of the enzyme (250 ng to 1 μg) and incubated at 37 °C for the times indicated. Free fatty acids were extracted using Dole reagent (propan-2-ol, heptane, and 1 n H2SO4, 20:5:1) and separated by silicic acid chromatography as previously described using unlabeled oleic acid (25 μg) as carrier lipid (29Leslie C.C. Gelb M.H. Methods Mol. Biol. 2004; 284: 229-242PubMed Google Scholar). Lysophospholipase activity was measured using 1-[14C]palmitoyl-2-lyso-PC substrate sonicated in 50 mm Hepes, pH 7.4, to make micelles as previously described (30de Carvalho M.G. Garritano J. Leslie C.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 20439-20446Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). Assays contained 50 μm substrate (120,000 dpm), 1 mm EGTA, and 5 mm CaCl2 in a final volume of 50 μl. Reactions were started by adding affinity-purified enzyme and incubated at 37 °C for the times indicated. Free fatty acid product was extracted using Dole reagent. After vortexing, the upper heptane phase was removed and dried under a stream of nitrogen, and 0.5 ml of heptane was added. Radiolabeled free fatty acids were measured by liquid scintillation spectrometry. For inhibitor experiments, enzymes were preincubated for 2 min at 37 °C with inhibitors, and reactions were started by the addition of substrate. Immunofluorescence Microscopy—BEAS-2B cells were plated in 35-mm glass bottom MatTek plates at a density of 1 × 105/cm2 and incubated overnight. The cells were washed twice with PBS and incubated with ice-cold fixative containing 3.2% paraformaldehyde and 3% sucrose in PBS for 15 min. After fixation, cells were rinsed five times with PBS and permeabilized with 0.1% Triton X-100 in PBS for 15 min at room temperature. Samples were blocked for 1 h in PBS containing 10% fetal bovine serum and incubated with rabbit polyclonal antibody to full-length cPLA2β1 (1:100) overnight, followed by incubation with goat anti-rabbit secondary antibody conjugated to Texas Red (1:200) for 1 h. For mitochondrial localization, cells were co-stained with mouse monoclonal antibody to anti-OxPhos complex V, subunit b (1:100) for 2 h, followed by anti-mouse secondary antibody conjugated to Alexa Fluor 488 (1:100) for 1 h. For localization of early or late endosomes, fixed cells were incubated (2 h) with monoclonal antibody to EEA1 or monoclonal antibody to MRP-6 (1:100), respectively. BEAS-2B cells were loaded with 1 mm lysotracker blue-white for 1 h prior to fixation for localization of lysosomes, and a monoclonal antibody to human golgin 97 was used for the identification of Golgi. For translocation of cPLA2α, BEAS-2B cells were transfected with GFP-cPLA2α, serum-starved overnight, and either left unstimulated or stimulated with 1 μm ionomycin for 15 min followed by fixation. Immunofluorescence microscopy was carried out using an inverted Zeiss 200M microscope with a 175-watt xenon lamp. Cells were visualized with a 63× oil immersion objective using Cy3 and fluorescein isothiocyanate filters. Images were acquired with a CCD camera from Sensicam, and data were analyzed using Intelligent Imaging Innovations Inc. (3I) software. Tissue Distribution of cPLA2β Protein, Identification of Transcripts, and Protein Variant Expressed in BEAS-2B Cells—To identify the form of cPLA2β expressed in human tissues and cells, a polyclonal antibody to full-length cPLA2β1 was generated. Western blot analysis revealed a 100-kDa protein that was present in all tissues (Fig. 1A). In some tissues (lung, spleen, and ovary), the 100-kDa protein was the predominant band detected (Fig. 1A). In other tissues, prominent lower molecular weight bands were also observed in the 40–60-kDa range. The lower molecular weight proteins and the 100-kDa band were not observed when blots were probed only with secondary antibody. The 100-kDa protein detected with antibody to cPLA2β is smaller than the 114-kDa product predicted from the previously cloned open reading frame of cPLA2β1, suggesting that a different splice variant of cPLA2β is expressed in cells. Based on the human tissue blot analysis showing that lung primarily expresses a 100-kDa form of cPLA2β and results of an earlier study revealing that BEAS-2B human bronchial epithelial cells express the mRNA for cPLA2β (31Lindbom J. Ljungman A.G. Lindahl M. Tagesson C. J Interferon Cytokine Res. 2002; 22: 947-955Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar), we chose this cell line for further study of endogenous cPLA2β. The expression of cPLA2β in BEAS-2B cells was evaluated by Western blotting using an antibody to full-length cPLA2β1 and an anti-peptide antibody generated to a peptide corresponding to a sequence unique to cPLA2β that is between the truncated JmjC domain and the C2 domain. The anti-peptide antibody (Fig. 1B, lane 1) and antibody to full-length cPLA2β1 (Fig. 1B, lane 2) exclusively detect a 100-kDa protein in BEAS-2B lysates. When transfected into BEAS-2B cells, untagged cPLA2β1 is expressed as a 114-kDa protein, clearly larger than the endogenous form of cPLA2β (Fig. 1B, lane 3). The antibody to full-length cPLA2β1 and the anti-peptide antibody were confirmed not to cross-react with cPLA2α. Western blot analysis of BEAS-2B lysate using antibody to cPLA2α revealed that cPLA2α migrates just below 100 kDa and was clearly separated from the 100-kDa band detected with antibodies to cPLA2β. In addition, recombinant affinity-purified human cPLA2α was not detected by antibodies to cPLA2β by Western blotting. To provide additional evidence that the 100-kDa form in BEAS-2B cells is endogenous cPLA2β, RNA interference was used. BEAS-2B cells were transfected with SMART pool siRNA based on the cPLA2β1 sequence and nontargeting control siRNA. Western blot analysis of whole cell lysates prepared 48 h post-transfection showed a concentration-dependent knockdown of the 100-kDa protein with targeting siRNA, whereas nontargeting control siRNA had no effect (Fig. 1C). Analysis of the same samples revealed no change in the level of cPLA2α (data not shown). The RNA interference experiments support the Western blot finding that the 100-kDa protein in BEAS-2B cells is cPLA2β. Cloning of cPLA2β from BEAS-2B Cells—To determine the basis for the lower molecular weight of cPLA2β, reverse transcription-PCR of total RNA from BEAS-2B cells was carried out using specific primers (sequences described under “Experimental Procedures”) designed based on the cPLA2β1 sequence (AF065215) (17Pickard R.T. Strifler B.A. Kramer R.M. Sharp J.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 8823-8831Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (182) Google Scholar). Three forward and reverse primers were used; Fwdp1 is in the 5′-untranslated region sequence covering the Kozak sequence and the start codon (Fig. 2A). The reverse primer (Revp3) is in the 3′-untranslated regio"

https://openalex.org/W2017766720,"There is much interest in developing stem cells and the cells derived from them as therapies for treating human disease and injury, but many biological, technological and regulatory hurdles have to be overcome before these cell therapies can be brought to commercial fruition. There is much interest in developing stem cells and the cells derived from them as therapies for treating human disease and injury, but many biological, technological and regulatory hurdles have to be overcome before these cell therapies can be brought to commercial fruition. Not a day goes by without news of another advance in steering stem cells, and the cells derived from them, toward therapies for treating human disorders. For example, last month StemCells, Inc., a Palo Alto biotechnology firm, announced that it has joined forces with clinicians at Oregon Health and Science University for an FDA-approved Phase I clinical trial to transplant neural stem cells purified from human fetal brain tissue into the brains of infants with Batten's disease. The hope is that the transplanted cells will produce the lysosomal enzyme that is missing in this fatal disease. “We're all looking for a sound success where the delivery of cells makes a difference. It would be enormously encouraging,” says George Daley, a stem cell researcher at Harvard Medical School. The overall vision for cell-based therapies, also called regenerative medicine, seems deceptively simple: Use healthy living cells to replace diseased, dying, or missing cells or tissues. One approach is to obtain sufficient numbers of a specific cell type derived from fetal or adult human stem cells, or from human embryonic stem cells, and then transplant an appropriate “dose” of these cells into the patient's body in the correct location. As researchers are discovering, however, turning living cells into transplantable therapies is a complex multistep process. The FDA's Center for Biologics Evaluation and Research (CBER) is responsible for overseeing therapeutics composed of human cells, tissues, and cellular and tissue-based products—or HCT/Ps. So far only one product, Carticel, has been licensed, which industry analysts say clearly indicates just how young the regenerative medicine field actually is and how many challenges it faces. Carticel, manufactured by Genzyme, is an autologous cell therapy for repairing injured knee cartilage. It was approved by the FDA in 1997 and passed its 10,000th patient milestone in 2004. Chondrocytes from the patient's healthy cartilage are obtained by biopsy and cultured in the laboratory to expand the cell population, which is then implanted into the patient's injured knee. Several tissue-engineered products, primarily for skin repair, have been approved by another section of the FDA, the Center for Devices and Radiological Health. Because engineered products often combine a biological product with a medical device, from a regulation point of view, they are considered separately from products composed purely of cells. Fashioning a cell therapy that works effectively in the body may require more R&D than is required for making drugs. “Since these products contain living cells, a number of factors contribute to the challenges of manufacturing and [FDA] approval,” noted FDA public affairs specialist Paul Richards in an email, “including the potential for adventitious agent contamination, the need for aseptic processing, the inability to ‘sterilize’ the final product and assurance they are free from infectious diseases.” Distribution of these products can also be a challenge, says Richards, due to their short shelf life and the need to ensure that they remain genetically stable, that is, that they do not acquire mutations. That there is only one FDA-approved cell product on the market does not reflect the actual number of cell therapies available because approval is not required for cell therapies “that are minimally manipulated, labeled or advertised for homologous use only, and not combined with a drug or device,” according to FDA specifications. A surgeon who takes bone marrow cells from a patient's hip bone and immediately puts them back into the same patient's bloodstream does not have to pause for a multi-year review process. However, if cells, whether autologous (from the patient) or allogeneic (from a donor), are cultured for twenty-four hours or longer—that is, manipulated—then FDA oversight is required. (Oversight of bone marrow transplantation, as well as whole organ transplants, falls under the purview of the Health Resources Services Administration and not the FDA.) For the many cell therapies currently in the R&D pipeline that are more than minimally manipulated, their developers must overcome numerous manufacturing hurdles if their product is to pass FDA muster. Simply knowing which type of cell will work best for treating a particular disorder can take several years to test. For instance, there are as many as twelve different types of cells under investigation for treating cardiovascular disease, according to Robert Deans, vice president of regenerative medicine at Athersys, Inc., a Cleveland-based biotech company. They range from stem and progenitor cells derived from umbilical cord blood, bone marrow, blood vessels, adipose tissue, and the heart itself to human embryonic stem cells that have the potential to generate the appropriate cell type. Athersys, together with physicians from the Cleveland Clinic, has its sights set on using a mesenchymal stem cell from adult bone marrow (first identified by Catherine Verfaillie in 1999) to treat acute myocardial infarction. The biotech company expects to soon file an IND (investigational new drug application) with the FDA for their product “MultiStem,” the first step on the path to a Phase I clinical trial. The technology of cell selection—the ability to isolate the exact type of cell needed in sufficient quantities for an effective dose—has proved problematic for potential cell therapies. Flow cytometry accurately sorts cells into different populations but is slow and uses an aerosol phase that could expose cells to contaminants in the air. “Every mouse paper you read probably has used an optical cell sorter, because that's the most precise way of selecting cells,” observes John Gilbert, CEO of Cytonome, a Boston company that is designing an optical sorter with no aerosol phase. “But if you want to move to humans, you've got a problem—safety and speed.” Although Cytonome is “still in stealth mode,” Gilbert says his company's machine “is an optical sorter that has no aerosol phase—its fluidics are in a closed disposable cartridge—and it's fast enough to make a human cell dose.” The next challenge is how to deliver cell therapies to the patient. For example, should cell therapies for repair of heart tissue be routed through the arteries or veins, or injected straight into heart tissue? Keith March at the Indiana University School of Medicine, who studies cardiovascular repair in a pig animal model, says “We have found that delivery devices and methods vary greatly in their ability to disperse cells in the heart, as well as in the efficiency and consistency of cell placement. It is therefore critical to understand and refine delivery techniques as one is developing therapeutic cells.” Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is now being applied to track the delivery of magnetically labeled cells after transplant to ensure that they reach their destination and do not wander into surrounding tissues. For example, a recent Nature Biotechnology paper reported magnetic resonance tracking of a dendritic cell vaccine injected into the lymph nodes of eight patients with melanoma. The autologous dendritic cells derived from the patient were loaded with tumor antigen and iron oxide particles in the laboratory prior to injection. MRI revealed that in four patients, the dendritic cells ended up not in the lymph nodes but in the surrounding fat, which may explain the limited effect of dendritic cell vaccines in clinical trials. The Netherlands, China, and other countries have already adopted magnetic resonance tracking in patients. However, it may be one to three more years before the FDA approves an IND application for magnetic resonance tracking in the United States, says Joseph Frank, chief of the NIH's Experimental Neuroimaging Section and a pioneer of the technology. Even when the biological and technical hurdles are overcome, there is still the regulatory gauntlet to get through. Since 1993, the FDA has been modernizing its regulations to keep up with the research community's growing interest in treating patients with cell- and tissue-based products. Addressing the FDA's concerns regarding the development of stem cell-based products, Darin Weber, former chief of the FDA's cell therapies branch and currently with The Biologics Consulting Group, advises “You want to know your product better than anyone in the world.” A thorough understanding of what your cells do in a dish, an animal, and a human will help answer the questions the FDA is inevitably going to ask you about your product, questions like: Where, specifically, will the cells be placed, and if they migrate, where will they go? How well do they integrate into the host, and what is the extent of their functional activity? Safety studies, says Weber, should address dosing issues, delivery techniques, immunosuppression regimens, and potential serious side effects, including the cells' potential to form tumors. Whether researchers are or aren't manipulating cells, they should be attentive to three new key FDA rules. These additions are intended to strengthen the FDA's monitoring of cells and tissues destined for therapeutic application “while minimizing regulatory burden,” according to CBER. The first rule, which became fully effective in January '04, requires any establishment that uses HCT/Ps to register with the FDA and list their manufactured products. The second, “donor eligibility,” helps to ensure that tissues meant for transplant come from individuals who are free of disease, with an emphasis on communicable diseases. The third rule—which, along with the “donor eligibility” rule, took effect in May last year—underscores good tissue practice (GTP) and requires researchers to follow specific measures that guard against tissue contamination. “Stem-cell based therapies provide regulatory challenges due to their intrinsic biologic properties, namely, their robust capacity for self-renewal and replication and their ability to differentiate into a variety of tissue types,” said Chris Middendorf, Chief of the FDA's Consumer Affairs Branch, in an email. Thus, although preclinical proof-of-concept and toxicological assessment testing for cell-based therapies has much in common with testing for drug approval, “the type and extent of preclinical testing expected may vary depending on perceived risks to the patient posed by the fundamental biology of a cellular therapy, including stem cells…. It is FDA's intention that the extent of regulatory oversight be commensurate with the potential risk posed by the product.” When it comes to approaching the FDA for INDs for cell therapies, the action is principally at the level of small and medium-sized biotech companies, with much less participation by big pharma. This is not altogether surprising, suggests Peter Mountford, CEO of Stem Cell Sciences—a twelve-year-old biotech company that aims to generate neural cell types from human embryonic stem cells to treat Parkinson's disease and other disorders. “Really, biotech needs to be coordinating this project,” of growing cells and scaling up their numbers for therapies, says Mountford. “Big pharma isn't going to do it, because they are small molecule companies, and that's their focus. And it's also ethically very sensitive for them—they are very concerned about public reactions. If a large pharma was to announce that they had entered the embryonic stem cell field, it could knock one percent off their market capitalization; that's a very expensive announcement. So it's not for the pharmaceutical industry—although they will buy into the business opportunity when it's more mature. It's truly a biotech-based initiative.” “By and large, big pharma is built on pills and injectibles, and hasn't liked the stem cell model,” points out Steven Burrill, CEO of San Francisco-based Burrill and Company, a life sciences firm with ties to venture capital and merchant banking. Burrill foresees a time, nevertheless, when cell therapies will “be an exciting and explosive part of the medical industry,” drawing the keen interest of both venture capital and major pharmaceutical companies. Within ten years, he estimates, such interest will begin “perking up,” as more and more cell therapies prove themselves. Even though the majority of cell therapies are being created in the academic setting, in Mountford's view, academic researchers shouldn't necessarily coordinate the scaling up of cell therapies as their place is at the cutting edge of basic research. A current conundrum, notes Darin Weber, is to what extent scientific results from academic labs can be translated into commercial products. Even if they spin off into biotech ventures, they may not be commercially lucrative enough to turn the heads of big pharma. There are, nonetheless, “many companies in the traditional pharmaceuticals—both drug and medical devices—who are investing cautiously in small biotech behind the scenes, hoping that a few actually come to fruition,” says Weber. To date little venture capital has flowed into the stem cell therapeutics field. In Peter Mountford's opinion, venture capitalists tend to have the misconception that stem cell therapy is as risky as gene therapy, which investors shied away from after the death of a patient in 1999. “Gene therapy,” observes Mountford “was a whole new concept that was developed to do something that has no real precedent in normal biology”: using viruses to deliver genes into cells. Cell-based therapy is different as it “reproduces what the body does normally.” Pfizer, a pharma giant that “is committed to small molecules and not developing any cell-based therapies,” says John Hambor with Pfizer Global Research and Development, has been studying mouse embryonic stem cells for more than fifteen years for other reasons. Inducing these cells to differentiate into dopaminergic, serotonergic, or other types of neurons could provide a renewable source of nerve cells for testing new small-molecule drugs for treating neurological diseases such as Parkinson's and schizophrenia. Some onlookers believe that using stem cells for testing new drugs has the potential to wind up a bigger business than using stem cells as therapies. “Stem cells represent an important new source of assays for drug development,” observes George Daley, “and in the near term are likely to prove more valuable as tools for drug research rather than therapeutic entities themselves. Until cells can be mass produced as readily and cheaply as small molecules, and used off-the-shelf without having to be customized to individual patients, big pharma will continue to focus on what it does best, making small molecule drugs.” Pharmaceutical companies, meanwhile, are expected to keep adding to an expanding group of manufactured drugs that beneficially trigger the proliferation of stem and progenitor cells in the body. This “endogenous” approach, exemplified by the growth factors erythropoietin and thrombopoietin (which stimulate production of red blood cells and platelets, respectively), handily avoids all of the difficulties associated with transplanting cells. But activating cells in the body to do medicine's bidding requires its own set of complex maneuvers. Clearly, stem cells and the cells derived from them have great potential to serve medicine—from therapies, to drug testing, to teaching us more about the body's biology. With the cache of FDA-approved new drugs having fallen from over 50 in 1996 to 20 in 2005, according to a New York Times report, the vision of what cell-based medicines might achieve has injected optimism into the difficult search for new ways to treat human disease.

To gain insight into the interactions between Hsp90 and its clients, here we have reduced the protein level of Hsp90 in avian cells by gene targeting in an attempt to elicit the otherwise undetectable (because of the vast amount of cellular Hsp90) Hsp90-interacting proteins. Hsp90β-deficient cells can grow, albeit more slowly than wild-type cells. B cell antigen receptor signaling is multiply impaired in these mutant cells; in particular, the amount of immunoglobulin M heavy chain protein is markedly reduced. Furthermore, serum activation does not promote ERK phosphorylation in Hsp90β-deficient cells. These multifaceted depressive effects seem to be provoked independently of each other and possibly recapitulate the proteome-wide in vivo functions of Hsp90. Reintroduction of the Hsp90β gene efficiently restores all of the defects. Unexpectedly, however, introducing the Hsp90α gene is also effective in restoration; thus, these defects might be caused by a reduction in the total expression of Hsp90 rather than by loss of Hsp90β-specific function.

Living cells continuously cope with protein folding and assembly. Because cell fate (e.g. proliferation, differentiation and even death) is determined and implemented by a plethora of varied proteins, the folding and assembly of these proteins are crucial to the life of a cell. However, many proteins do not achieve correct folding or proper assembly autonomously in the cell; instead, they require the assistance of molecular chaperones (1Bukau B. Deuerling E. Pfund C.

Although the proteome-wide function of Hsp90 as a capacitor for morphological evolution that buffers cryptic genetic variation is well known (18Queitsch C. Sangster T.A. Lindquist S.

Hsp90 is not required for the de novo folding of most proteins in yeast under normal conditions (23Nathan D.F. Vos M.H. Lindquist S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 12949-12956Crossref PubMed Scopus (311) Google Scholar), and reduction to 1/20 of its normal level can be tolerated (24Xu Y. Singer M.A. Lindquist S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 109-114Crossref PubMed Scopus (163) Google Scholar). By contrast, mouse mutant embryos lacking Hsp90β die because of defects in the development of the placental labyrinth (25Voss A.K. Thomas T. Gruss P. Development. 2000; 127: 1-11Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Higher eukaryotes contain two Hsp90 isoforms that closely resemble each other (Hsp90α and Hsp90β). Although each forms a homodimer (26Minami Y. Kawasaki H. Miyata Y. Suzuki K. Yahara I. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 10099-10103Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), no obvious difference in function between the two isoforms has been reported so far. The developmental deficiency observed in the Hsp90β mutant embryos may be attributable to a lack of specific functions that are fulfilled by only Hsp90β (25Voss A.K. Thomas T. Gruss P. Development. 2000; 127: 1-11Crossref PubMed Google Scholar); alternatively, the reduced expression level of Hsp90 may impinge on a specific aspect of the placental development. These possibilities raise two questions. First, do Hsp90α and Hsp90β have individual functions that cannot be accomplished by one another? Second, to what extent can the expression of Hsp90 be decreased without losing viability in higher eukaryotic cells? Anti-tumor agents such as geldanamycin (GA) compete with ATP for binding to the specific pocket of Hsp90 and ultimately block its ATPase-driven chaperone cycle (27Kamal A. Thao L. Sensintaffar J.

Cell. 1997; 89: 239-250Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1222) Google Scholar); therefore, they are efficient inhibitors of Hsp90 that can be used to dissect its functions (7Pearl L.H. Prodromou C. Curr. Opin. Struct. Biol. 2000; 10: 46-51Crossref PubMed Scopus (276) Google Scholar, 8Picard D. Cell. Mol.

Because GA binds to both Hsp90α and Hsp90β (30Lele Z. Hartson S.D. Martin C.C. Whitesell L. Matts R.L. Krone P.H. Dev. Biol. 1999; 210: 56-70Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar), this Hsp90-inhibitor is not suitable for discriminating between the functions of the two Hsp90 isoforms. In addition, our attempts to use small interfering RNA-directed gene knockdown of the specific isoforms of Hsp90 have not led to the successful depletion of either Hsp90α or Hsp90β. 5F. Shinozaki, M. Minami, K. Terasawa, and Y. Minami, unpublished data.5F. Shinozaki, M. Minami, K. Terasawa, and Y. Minami, unpublished data. Thus, to address the aforementioned issues, here we have generated cells from the chicken B lymphocyte line DT40 that are deficient in Hsp90β. We show that multiple defects are concurrently elicited in the mutant cells; in particular, components involved in B cell antigen receptor (BCR) signaling are impaired. Most strikingly, the expression level of the immunoglobulin (Ig) M heavy chain is profoundly reduced. These defects can be efficiently corrected not only by reintroducing the Hsp90β gene but also by introducing the Hsp90α gene; therefore, the defects observed in these cells are derived mainly from a reduction in the Hsp90 content and not from a loss of Hsp90β-specific function. Plasmid Constructs—Chicken Hsp90β genomic DNA was obtained from DT40-derived genomic DNA by PCR amplification based on previous studies (31Meng X. Baulieu E.-E. Catelli M.-G. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1995; 206: 644-651Crossref PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar, 32Meng X. Jérôme V. Devin J. Baulieu E.-E. Catelli M.-G. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1993; 190: 630-636Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar) and confirmed by DNA sequencing. Two targeting constructs, Hsp90β-neo and Hsp90β-hisD, were generated by replacing the DNA segment encompassing exons 4 to 6 with drug-resistant cassettes for neomycin (neo) and histidinol (hisD), respectively. Chicken Hsp90α and Hsp90β cDNAs were synthesized by reverse transcription (RT)-PCR using mRNA isolated from DT40 cells and were cloned either into the pApuro2 vector (made by introducing a multicloning site into the pApuro vector (33Takata M. Sabe H. Hata A. Inazu T. Homma Y. Nukada T. Yamamura H. Kurosaki T. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 1341-1349Crossref PubMed Scopus (584) Google Scholar)) for their (re)introduction into Hsp90β-deficient cells or into the Escherichia coli expression vector pET23a (Novagen) for the production of recombinant proteins. A cDNA fragment encoding a region of Hsp90β (residues 571–725) was introduced into a pGEX6P2 plasmid (Amersham Biosciences) to produce a glutathione S-transferase (GST) fusion protein. The cytoplasmic domain of chicken Igα was synthesized by RT-PCR using a previously described primer combination (34Pike K.A. Iacampo S. Fiedmann J.E. Ratcliffe M.J.H. J. Immunol. 2004; 172: 2210-2218Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar), and the cDNA fragment was introduced into a pGEX6P2 plasmid. Cell Culture, Transfection, and Screening—DT40 cells were cultured in RPMI1640 medium (Sigma) containing 10% (v/v) fetal bovine serum, 1% (v/v) chicken serum, 50 μm β-mercaptoethanol, and antibiotics (penicillin and streptomycin) at 39.5 °C under 5% CO2. Cells were electroporated at 25 microfarads and 550 V with a Gene Pulser II apparatus (Bio-Rad); ∼107 cells and 50 μg of linearized DNA were used for each transfection (35Buerstedde J. Takeda S. Cell. 1991; 67: 179-188Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (476) Google Scholar). Stable transformants were selected with 2 mg/ml G-418, 1 mg/ml histidinol, and 0.5 μg/ml puromycin (all from Sigma). Genomic DNAs were isolated using a DNeasy Tissue Kit (Qiagen). The DNAs (5 μg) were digested with PvuII, separated in 0.8% (w/v) agarose gels, and transferred onto a Hybond N+ nylon membrane (Amersham Biosciences). Membranes were hybridized with an Hsp90β genomic DNA fragment, as shown in Fig. 1A, which was labeled using a Gene Images random prime labeling and detection system (Amersham Biosciences) as a probe. After incubating cells with tetrazolium salt WST-8 (Cell Counting Kit-8: Dojindo), the optical density was measured at 450 nm to assess cell viability. Northern Blot Analysis and RT-PCR—Total RNA was isolated by using an RNeasy Mini kit (Qiagen). Membranes (5 μg of RNA) were hybridized with the following fluorescently labeled cDNA fragments as probes: the EcoRI-PstI fragment of Hsp90α (0.63 kb); the BglII fragment of Hsp90β (0.8 kb); a PCR fragment of IgM (X01613) synthesized with the two primers 5′-CGGAACAACTGAACGGCAAC-3′ and 5′-GCCCTATCCACCGACTTCTG-3′ (0.3 kilobases (kb)); the PstI-HindIII fragment of Igα (0.16 kb); the BamHI-EcoNI fragment of Igβ (0.27 kb). Total RNAs (1μg) were used for the first-strand synthesis with oligo(dT) and Superscript II RNaseH– reverse transcriptase (Invitrogen). For semiquantitative RT-PCR (membrane-bound (μm) and secreted (μs) forms of the IgM heavy chain (μ) and glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH)), total cDNA was subjected to a 3-fold dilution. PCR amplification was performed with KOD-Plus DNA polymerase (Toyobo) using the following oligonucleotide primers: μm, 5′-ATCTCCTCCATTGGCCTCTGGAG-3′ and 5′-TTTCACCTTGATGAGGGTGACGG-3′; μs, 5′-CGGAACAACTGAACGGCAAC-3′ and 5′-CAATCGAGCGGCCGCTTAACG-3′; X-box binding protein-1 (XBP-1), 5′-CAGCCTCTCCCTGGAGAACCAGG-3′ and 5′-CAGAATCCATGTGGAGGTTGTCAGGAATGGTGAC-3′; endoplasmic reticulum (ER) degradation-enhancing α-mannosidase-like protein (EDEM), 5′-TCCTGGACTGCAGGTGTTGATAGGAG-3′ and 5′-ATTCAGATCAAGCCCACCATCCGATC-3′; GAPDH, 5′-TGGAGAGATGGCAGAGGTGCTG-3′ and 5′-GGATGCCATGTGGACCATCAAG-3′. Purification of Bacterially Expressed Recombinant Proteins—For GST fusion proteins (Hsp90β and Igα) or His-tagged proteins (Hsp90α and Hsp90β), the corresponding vectors were introduced into E. coli strain BL21(DE3) pLysS (Stratagene). Cultures were induced with 0.4 mm isopropyl-1-β-d-galactopyranoside after reaching an absorbance at 600 nm of 0.6 and were further incubated for 30 min or 1 h, respectively, at 37 °C. Cells were harvested and washed with phosphate-buffered saline (137 mm NaCl, 2.68 mm KCl, 8.1 mm Na2HPO4, 1.47 mm KH2PO4, pH 7.4) for GST fusion proteins or with TBS (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 300 mm NaCl) for His-tagged proteins. Cells were resuspended in the same buffer solutions containing 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride and disrupted by sonication. Recombinant proteins were purified using glutathione-Sepharose 4 (Amersham Biosciences) or nickel nitrilotriacetic acid-agarose (Qiagen). Antisera—Anti-heat shock factor 1–3 (HSF1-HSF3), anti-Hsp70, anti-Hsp90α (36Kawazoe Y. Tanabe M. Sasai N. Nagata K. Nakai A. Eur. J. Biochem. 1999; 265: 688-697Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar), anti-Syk (33Takata M. Sabe H. Hata A. Inazu T. Homma Y. Nukada T. Yamamura H. Kurosaki T. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 1341-1349Crossref PubMed Scopus (584) Google Scholar), and anti-BLNK (37Ishiai M. Kurosaki M. Pappu R. Okawa K. Ronko I. Fu C. Shibata M. Iwamatsu A. Chan A.C. Kurosaki T. Immunity. 1999; 10: 117-125Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (288) Google Scholar) antisera have been described. Anti-mouse Hsp90 antisera were provided by Y. Miyata (Kyoto University). Antibodies specific for Y-box-binding protein 1 (YB-1) (directed against the N-terminal peptide of chicken YB-1) and a Y-box protein-associated acidic protein (YBAP1) (directed against recombinant proteins of chicken YBAP1) will be described in more detail elsewhere. 6K. Matsumoto, manuscript in preparation. Anti-chicken Hsp90β and anti-Igα antibodies were raised in rabbits using the GST fusion proteins. Anti-Hsp90α and anti-Hsp90β antisera (10 μl) were mixed with the His-tagged Hsp90β or Hsp90α proteins (100 μg), respectively, and incubated for 2 h at room temperature to eliminate mutual cross-reactivities between them; for anti-Hsp90β antisera, incubation was further continued overnight after the re-addition of Hsp90α protein (100 μg). Anti-chicken IgM monoclonal antibody M4 (Southern Biotechnology) and goat anti-chicken IgM antibody (Betyl Laboratories) were used for BCR stimulation and for immunoprecipitation/immunoblotting, respectively. The following antibodies were purchased: anti-phosphotyrosine monoclonal antibody 4G10 (Upstate Biotechnology); anti-Raf-1 (C-12 and E-10) and horseradish peroxidase-conjugated anti-goat IgG antibodies (Santa Cruz Biotechnology); anti-ERK, anti-phosphorylated ERK, anti-MEK, anti-phosphorylated MEK, anti-Akt and phospho-(Ser/Thr) Akt substrate antibodies (Cell Signaling Technology); anti-actin antibody (Sigma); horseradish peroxidase-conjugated anti-rabbit and anti-mouse antibodies (Amersham Biosciences). Stimulation of DT40 Cells—Cells were washed twice with phosphate-buffered saline and resuspended in serum-free RPMI1640 medium. After a 10-min incubation at 39.5 °C, cells were activated by the addition of either 4 μg/ml of anti-IgM antibodies (M4) or 20% (v/v) fetal bovine serum. Western Blot Analysis and Immunoprecipitation—Where indicated, cells were treated with 2 μm GA (Sigma), 50 μg/ml of cycloheximide (CHX) (Sigma), or 50 nm calyculin A (Cell Signaling Technology) before cell lysis. Cells were lysed in Nonidet P-40 lysis buffer (1% Nonidet P-40, 150 mm NaCl, 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 1 mm EDTA) containing 50 mm NaF, 10 μm sodium molybdate, and 0.2 mm sodium vanadate (33Takata M. Sabe H. Hata A. Inazu T. Homma Y. Nukada T. Yamamura H. Kurosaki T. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 1341-1349Crossref PubMed Scopus (584) Google Scholar) supplemented with protease inhibitor mixture (Complete mini: Roche Applied Science). Cell lysates were cleared by centrifugation at 16,000 × g for 15 min and subjected to SDS-PAGE followed by transfer onto Immobilon-P membranes (Millipore). Blots were incubated with antibodies and subjected to chemiluminescence detection with Western Lightning Chemiluminescence Reagent Plus (PerkinElmer Life Sciences). The intensity of immunodetected protein bands was quantified using NIH image software after scanning of the blot with a densitometer. For immunoprecipitation, cell lysates were incubated with antibodies for 10 min on ice, either protein A- or protein G-Sepharose (Amersham Biosciences) was then added, and incubation was continued for a further 3 h. The immunoprecipitates were washed four times with Nonidet P-40 lysis buffer. To prepare μs proteins for immunoblotting, cells were cultured for 12 h in RPMI1640 with 10% fetal bovine serum, and the secreted μs proteins were immunoprecipitated and immunoblotted with anti-IgM antibodies (Betyl Laboratories). Phosphatase Treatment—Cell lysates (30 μl) were incubated with or without 60 units of λ protein phosphatase (New England Biolabs) for 30 min at 30 °C. Flow Cytometric Analysis—Cells were washed with a buffer solution (phosphate-buffered saline, 0.3% (w/v) bovine serum albumin, 0.02% (w/v) sodium azide) and incubated with the same solution containing goat anti-chicken IgM antibody for 30 min on ice. After washing twice, cells were incubated with fluorescein isothiocyanate-labeled rabbit anti-goat antibody (Sigma) for 30 min on ice. The stained cells were then resuspended in 1 ml of the above solution, and their fluorescent intensity was analyzed by a Beckman Epics XL flow cytometer (Beckman Coulter). In Vitro Kinase Assay—For the in vitro Raf-1 kinase assay, immunoprecipitates obtained with anti-Raf-1 antibody (E-10) were washed four times with Nonidet P-40 lysis buffer and then with ice-cold reaction buffer (20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, and 10 mm MgCl2). The kinase reaction was performed in 30 μl of the reaction buffer containing 250 μm ATP and 1 μg of recombinant MEK-1 substrate (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) at 30 °C for 30 min. Targeted Gene Disruption of Hsp90β in Chicken DT40 Cells—Two different targeting constructs were designed to disrupt exons encoding the ATP-binding domain of Hsp90β that is essential to its chaperone function (38Obermann W.M.J. Sondermann H. Russo A.A. Pavletich N.P. Hartl F.U. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 143: 901-910Crossref PubMed Scopus (479) Google Scholar, 39Panaretou B. Prodromou C. Roe S.M. O'Brien R. Ladbury J.E. Piper P.W. Pearl L.H. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 4829-4836Crossref PubMed Scopus (610) Google Scholar) (Fig. 1A). We generated Hsp90β-deficient cells by the successive transfection of these two constructs (Fig. 1B). Southern blot analysis indicated that the constructs were properly targeted (Fig. 1B), and this result was corroborated by Northern blotting (Fig. 1C). Expression of Hsp90β protein was not detected in Hsp90β-deficient cells by Western blot analysis (Fig. 1D), albeit a faint band was seen probably due to cross-reactivity of anti-Hsp90β antibody with Hsp90α proteins. Notably, expression of Hsp90α protein did not increase in the Hsp90β-deficient cells (Fig. 1D); consistent with this, the level of Hsp90α mRNA was comparable with that in wild-type cells (Fig. 1C). The protein levels of Hsp70 and Hsp40 were also unchanged in the Hsp90β-deficient cells (data not shown). Taken together, we conclude that Hsp90β can be successfully depleted by gene disruption and that expression of Hsp90α does not increase to compensate for the lack of Hsp90β protein. Although the Hsp90β-deficient cells did not lose viability and their saturation densities did not differ from those of wild-type cells (data not shown), they grew more slowly; by contrast, heterozygous mutant cells seemed to grow normally (Fig. 1E). Thus, the gene knock-out of Hsp90β apparently affected an aspect of cell proliferation. Initially, we suspected that the heat shock response might be compromised in Hsp90β-deficient cells, because Hsp90 has been suggested to have a role in modulating HSF1 (40Morimoto R.I. Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 3788-3796Crossref PubMed Scopus (1509) Google Scholar). Western blotting showed, however, that the expression levels of the HSFs (avian cells express HSF1-HSF3) were unchanged (Fig. 2A), although HSF2 is not activated by heat stress (36Kawazoe Y. Tanabe M. Sasai N. Nagata K. Nakai A. Eur. J. Biochem. 1999; 265: 688-697Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). Within 15 min of sustained exposure to 43 °C, an electrophoretic mobility shift of HSF3 was observed in both the wild-type and Hsp90β-deficient cells (Fig. 2B); by contrast, HSF1 did not show any detectable mobility shift (data not shown). This upshift pattern of HSF3 in the two cell clones was eliminated by phosphatase treatment (Fig. 2C), which reconfirms a previous study showing that the characteristic mobility shift of mammalian HSF1 results from stress-induced phosphorylation (indicating the transient activation) (41Satyal S.H. Chen D. Fox S.G. Kramer J.M. Morimoto R.I. Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 1962-1974Crossref PubMed Scopus (183) Google Scholar); HSF3 is dominant among the three HSFs in regulation of the heat shock response in DT40 cells (42Tanabe M. Kawazoe Y. Takeda S. Morimoto R.I. Nagata K. Nakai A. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 1750-1758Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). Most importantly, an equal accumulation of Hsp70 after the upshift of HSF3 bands was detected in the two cell clones (Fig. 2B). We, therefore, conclude that the heat shock response is intact in Hsp90β-deficient cells. Expression of IgM Is Markedly Reduced in Hsp90β-deficient Cells—Signaling through the BCR is essential for B cell function (43Hendriks R.W. Middendorp S. Trends Immunol. 2004; 25: 249-256Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar, 44Kurosaki T. Nat. Rev. Immunol. 2002; 2: 354-363Crossref PubMed Scopus (170) Google Scholar). BCR cross-linking by anti-IgM antibody induced an immediate increase in tyrosine phosphorylation on several proteins (indicating successful stimulation), and ERK was phosphorylated concurrently in wild-type cells (Fig. 3A). Whereas tyrosine phosphorylation was reduced to some extent, ERK phosphorylation appeared to be almost unaltered in Hsp90β+/– cells (Fig. 3A). By contrast, the amounts of tyrosine-phosphorylated proteins and phosphorylated ERK were markedly decreased in Hsp90β-deficient cells (Fig. 3A). These observations strongly suggest that loss of Hsp90β impairs a factor or factors involved in early phases of BCR signaling. The BCR consists of the antigen binding membrane Ig (IgM in DT40 cells) (45Kurosaki T. Maeda A. Ishiai M. Hashimoto A. Inaba K. Takata M. Immunol. Rev. 2000; 176: 19-29Crossref PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar) and the signaling heterodimers of Igα and Igβ (43Hendriks R.W. Middendorp S.

Western blotting revealed that the amount of the μ chain (i.e. the total amount of both μm and μs in cell lysates) was greatly reduced in Hsp90β-deficient cells, whereas Hsp90β+/– cells showed somewhat decreased but yet significant amounts of μ protein (Fig. 3B). These observations were corroborated by flow cytometric analysis of the expression of μ chains at the cell surface (i.e. μm) in Hsp90β+/– and Hsp90β–/– cells (Fig. 3C). Unexpectedly, μs protein was also drastically decreased in Hsp90β-deficient cells (Fig. 3B). Despite these findings, we observed only a slight, if any, reduction in μ transcripts in these mutant cells, as measured by Northern blotting (Fig. 3D) or by semiquantitative RT-PCR (Fig. 3E). These data have a strong resemblance to those of a recent study in which a profound depression in synthesis of IgM protein was detected in mouse B cells deficient in the transcription factor XBP-1, notwithstanding μ transcript levels similar to those of wild-type cells (46Tirosh B. Iwakoshi N.N. Glimcher L.H. Ploegh H.L. J. Exp. Med. 2005; 202: 505-516Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). It has been shown that mRNA of XBP-1 must be spliced to promote secretion of IgM, and this splicing in turn depends on the production of μm (46Tirosh B. Iwakoshi N.N. Glimcher L.H. Ploegh H.L. J. Exp. Med. 2005; 202: 505-516Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar, 47Iwakoshi N.N. Lee A.-H. Vallabhajosyula P. Otipoby K.L. Rajewsky K. Glimcher L.H. Nat.

We, therefore, considered that the function of XBP-1 might be compromised. Because EDEM is an XBP-1-dependent target gene (48Lee A.-H. Iwakoshi N.N."

Isoprenoids play important roles in all living organisms; they function as steroid hormones in mammals, carotenoids in plants, and ubiquinone or menaquinone in bacteria (1Sacchettini J.C. Poulter C.D. Science. 1997; 277: 1788-1789Crossref PubMed Scopus (460) Google Scholar). All isoprenoid compounds are characterized by the basic isoprene unit. Nature uses two activated isoprene units to build these prenoid compounds as follows: isopentenyl diphosphate (IPP) 3The abbreviations used are: IPP, isopentenyl diphosphate; DMAPP, dimethylallyl diphosphate; IDI, IPP isomerase; PEG, polyethyleneglycol; EIPP, 3,4-epoxy-3-methyl-1-butyl diphosphate; mme, monomethyl ether; PDB, Protein Data Bank; W T, wild type. and its electrophilic allylic isomer dimethylallyl diphosphate (DMAPP) (Scheme 1). Isopentenyl diphosphate:dimethylallyl diphosphate (IPP:DMAPP) isomerase (IDI; EC 5.3.3.2) is a key enzyme involved in the biosynthesis of isoprenoids and catalyzes the isomerization of IPP into DMAPP (2Hahn F.M. Poulter C.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 11298-11303Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). DMAPP then condenses with additional molecules of IPP to form farnesyl diphosphate, which is required for protein prenylation, cholesterol biosynthesis, and synthesis of a variety of higher molecular weight isoprenoids. Although the synthesis of IPP can occur through the mevalonate pathway in which acetyl-CoA and mevalonate are substrates, a mevalonate-independent pathway producing IPP and DMAPP was found in plant chloroplasts, algae, cyanobacteria, and some bacteria. This quite new pathway, known as the deoxyxylulose 5-phosphate pathway, begins with pyruvate and glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate as the initial substrates. Two types of IDI are reported. They show no sequence similarity but catalyze the same reaction. Type I enzyme is widely distributed in microorganisms. Type II IPP isomerase is a flavoprotein that belongs to the FMN-dependent α-hydroxyacid dehydrogenase family and displays a classical TIM barrel fold (3Kaneda K. Kuzuyama T. Takagi M. Hayakawa Y.

Biol. 2003; 329: 973-982Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). Type I IPP isomerase is composed of about 200 amino acids and folds into a compact globular protein that belongs to the class of α/β proteins. It is a metalloprotein containing divalent cations, Zn2+ and Mg2+, as cofactors (5Carrigan C.N. Poulter C.D. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 2003; 125: 9008-9009Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar, 6Bonnano J.B. Edo C. Eswar N. Pieper U. Romanowski M.J. Ilyin V. Gerchman S.E. Kycia H. Studier F.W. Sali A. Burley S.K. Proc.

Crystal structures of free and metal-bound Escherichia coli IDI-1 show that the first divalent cation is involved in the active conformation folding, with the metal occupying a first coordination site composed of three histidines and two glutamates (7Durbecq V. Sainz G. Oudjama Y. Clantin B. Bompard-Gilles C. Tricot C. Caillet J. Stalon V. Droogmans L. Villeret V. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 1530-1537Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar).

Oldfield E. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 2003; 125: 3198-3199Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar)) show the presence of the second metal site occupied by Mg2+ cation. Carbonyl oxygen of residue 67, side chain oxygen of Glu-87, two water molecules, and two nonbridging oxygens of the diphosphate moiety of the inhibitors coordinate this metal. Resolution of these crystallographic structures helped to clarify the protonation/deprotonation catalytic mechanism. IPP would be initially protonated by an acidic residue that is not currently known. DMAPP would then be formed by deprotonation via Cys-67. The importance of this last residue in the catalytic process was proved by site-directed mutagenesis. No residual activity is observed when the thiol group of cysteine is changed by a methyl moiety (C67A). Tryptophan 161 is optimally positioned deep in the active site and would stabilize, through quadrupole-charge interactions, the highly reactive carbocation intermediate, formed upon the protonation of IPP (supplemental Scheme S1) (7Durbecq V. Sainz G. Oudjama Y. Clantin B. Bompard-Gilles C. Tricot C. Caillet J. Stalon V. Droogmans L. Villeret V. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 1530-1537Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). However, these studies have not yet conclusively established the origin of the proton activating the double bond in IPP. Glu-116 is likely the critical acidic residue that drives protonation by lowering the energy of the carbocation as demonstrated by the crystallographic structure of the transition-state analogue N,N-dimethyl-2-amino-1-ethyl diphosphate in complex with the enzyme (8Wouters J. Oudjama Y. Barkley S.J. Tricot C. Stalon V. Droogmans L. Poulter C.D. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 11903-11908Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). However, Glu-116 is probably not protonated because it is directly coordinated to the catalytic metal cation. Therefore, it could not be the proton donor. Tyr-104 is a possible candidate for proton donation in the reaction catalyzed by IDI-1. Indeed, in the crystal structures of IDI-1, Tyr-104 is located in the active site of the enzyme and is directly hydrogen-bonded to Glu-116. The precise role of Tyr-104 during catalysis is not clear and deserves special attention. The present work was designed in an effort to clarify that question. Site-directed Mutagenesis—Plasmid pYL20, which contains the idi gene from E. coli with an engineered C-terminal His tag (LEHHHHHH), was available from previous studies (11Oudjama Y. Durbecq V. Sainz G. Clantin B. Tricot C. Stalon V. Villeret V. Droogmans L. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D Biol. Crystallogr. 2001; 57: 287-288Crossref PubMed Scopus (7) Google Scholar). Mutations Y104A and Y104F were introduced using the QuickChange site-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene). The pYL20 plasmid was used as a template in all experiments. Purification—E. coli BL21(DE3) pLysS cells (Novagen) transformed by the mutated pYL20 plasmid were grown to an OD660 of 0.4–0.5 (from OD660 of 0.2) at 37 °C. Expression of the recombinant enzymes was induced for 3 h at 37 °C using 1 mm isopropyl-β-d-thiogalactoside in the medium. Cells were resuspended in 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4. Cell disruption has been achieved by sonication for 10 min in a Raytheon sonic oscillator (250 watts, 10 kHz). In order to remove the wild-type chromosomic IPP isomerase from recombinant enzymes, purification was performed using nickel-ion affinity chromatography with resin (chelating Sepharose supplied by Amersham Biosciences) pre-equilibrated with 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4. Bound proteins were eluted by a linear gradient of 0–0.5 m imidazole in 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4. An SDS-polyacrylamide gel was useful to check the purity of IDI mutant proteins. The fractions from elution containing active recombinant IPP isomerase were pooled and dialyzed three times against 2 liters of 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, and 0.1 mm EDTA. The three mutant protein solutions were concentrated by ultrafiltration (YM10, Amicon) prior to crystallization trials. In contrast to WT IPP isomerase, for which an ideal concentration to obtain crystals was about 5 mg/ml, protein solutions of the mutants could not be concentrated higher than 2.0 and 3.1 mg/ml for Y104A and Y104F, respectively, based on protein concentration estimated by UV absorption. Enzymatic Activity—The principle of the IPP isomerase assay is based on the lability of DMAPP, which is transformed into the corresponding alcohol under acidic conditions, although IPP remains stable under the conditions of the assay (12Satterwhite D.M. Methods Enzymol. 1985; 110: 92-99Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The reaction was initiated by adding the enzyme to a mixture in 50 mm Tris-HCl buffer, pH 7.4, containing the divalent metal cofactors (1.5 mm Mn2+ and Mg2+) and [1-14C]IPP 18 μm in a final volume of 50 μl. After incubation at 37 °C, the reaction was stopped by addition of 400 μl of methanol/concentrated HCl (4:1, v/v). The mixture was subsequently incubated for 10 min at 37 °C, and the radioactive products were extracted with chloroform. The extraction was performed by vigorous vortexing followed by centrifugation at 10,000 × g for 2 min. A 200-μl portion of the organic layer was mixed with 5 ml of a scintillation mixture (ICN Biomedicals). The radioactivity was counted as a measure for the conversion of IPP into DMAPP. Crystallization Experiments—Crystallization trials were achieved by the hanging drop vapor-diffusion method at 20 °C. Each drop suspended on the top of a reservoir solution (0.6 ml) was a mixture of 4 μl of protein solution (2.0 and 3.1 mg/ml for Y104A and Y104F, respectively) with the same volume of the reservoir solution. E. coli IDI-1 mutants precipitated when the same crystallization conditions for WT IPP isomerase were used. Crystallization parameters were therefore adapted by screening precipitant concentration (10–16% (w/v) PEG 2000 monomethyl ether (mme)), pH (4.5–6.5), and additives (ammonium sulfate, MnCl2, and MgCl2). Small hexagonal crystals (maximum size 0.15 mm) were obtained for the Y104A mutant in 14% (w/v) PEG 2000 mme, 100 mm Tris maleate buffer, pH 4.5, in the presence of 100 mm ammonium sulfate, 20 mm MnCl2, and MgCl2. Larger crystals were obtained for the Y104F mutant under similar conditions (14% (w/v) PEG 2000 mme, 100 mm Tris maleate buffer, pH 5.0, in the presence of 100 mm ammonium sulfate and 20 mm MnCl2 and MgCl2). Complex was obtained by soaking crystals of the Y104F mutant with 3,4-epoxy-3-methyl-1-butyl diphosphate (EIPP), a mechanism-based irreversible inhibitor (8Wouters J. Oudjama Y. Barkley S.J. Tricot C. Stalon V. Droogmans L. Poulter C.D. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 11903-11908Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). Solution of the inhibitor (25 mm) in Tris maleate (100 mm, pH 4.5), PEG 2000 mme (14%), ammonium sulfate (100 mm), MnCl2 and MgCl2 (20 mm), and glycerol (25%) was replaced every 3 h for at least 24 h. Data Collection and Structure Determination—For the small Y104A mutant crystals (approximate size of about 0.15 mm) a complete data set to 1.76 Å was collected, after flash-freezing, at beam line BM30A (European Synchrotron Radiation Facility, Grenoble, France) on a MarResearch CCD. Data were processed with the HKL suite (13Otwinowski Z. Minor W. Methods Enzymol. 1997; 276: 307-326Crossref PubMed Scopus (38570) Google Scholar). The Y104A mutant crystallizes in space group P3121 with cell parameters a = b = 71.4 and c = 61.8 Å. There is one molecule in the asymmetric unit. For the Y104F mutant, a complete data set to 1.96 Å was collected with a Mar345 imaging plate system from MarResearch equipped with Osmic optics and running on an FR591 rotating anode generator on a single crystal. Data were processed with the MarFLM suite. The Y104F mutant crystallizes in space group P212121 with cell parameters a = 69.3, b = 72.6, and c = 92.5 Å. There are two molecules in the asymmetric unit, related by 2-fold noncrystallographic symmetry. Diffraction data of the complex Y104F-EIPP were collected to 1.97 Å. The cell parameters are a = 69.3, b = 72.6, and c = 92.5 Å, which correspond to a P212121 space group. There are also two molecules in the asymmetric unit, related by 2-fold noncrystallographic symmetry. The starting structure used for the refinement of Y104F and Y104F-EIPP corresponded to the metal-bound form of E. coli IDI (PDB code 1hx3). The Y104A mutant was refined starting from the metal-free form of IDI-1 (PDB code 1hzt). Refinement was performed with the Shelxl97 program (14Sheldrick G.M. Schneider T.R. Methods Enzymol. 1997; 277: 319-343Crossref PubMed Scopus (1885) Google Scholar). Electron density maps were inspected with the graphic program Turbo-Frodo (15Roussel A. Cambillau C. Turbo-Frodo 92. 1992; (Architecture et Fonction des Macromolécules Biologiques (AFMB), Marseille, France)Google Scholar), and the quality of the models was analyzed with the program Procheck (16Laskowski R.A. MacArthur M.W. Moss D.S. Thornton J.M. J. Appl. Crystallogr. 1993; 26: 283-291Crossref Google Scholar). Opening of the epoxide moiety in EIPP was carefully analyzed by refinement of both R and S stereochemical products. Data collection and refinement statistics are given in Table 1.

The absorption spectra at 280 nm were obtained using an UvikonXS spectrophotometer from Bio-Tek Instruments. The denaturation studies were carried out in the temperature range 25–80 °C using a scan rate of 1 °C·min–1. Samples were prepared by mixing protein solutions with 50 mm Tris-HCl buffer, pH 7.4, containing the divalent metal cofactors (1.5 mm Mn2+ and Mg2+) in order to obtain a final protein concentration of 0.3 mg·ml–1. The solutions were then equilibrated for 10 min prior to carrying out the thermal denaturation study. A spectrum of the buffer only was recorded as a blank. Finally, the first derivative of absorbance with respect to temperature (dA/dT) was calculated in order to determine the Td (temperature of protein denaturation). This Td is related to the thermal stability of the protein (19Bagger H.L. Fuglsang C.C. Westh P. Biochemistry. 2003; 42: 10295-10300Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar). Construction and Characterization of Tyr-104 Mutants—In order to test the importance of residue Tyr-104 in the mechanism of IDI-1, two mutants were constructed by site-directed mutagenesis and sequenced, Y104A and Y104F. In the first mutant, the phenol lateral chain of Tyr-104 is replaced by a nonaromatic side chain. In the second mutant (Y104F), the aromatic ring is conserved, but the hydroxyl group is removed. The corresponding C-terminal His-tagged proteins were overexpressed in E. coli and purified by affinity chromatography. This protocol yielded mutants in a pure form suitable for enzymatic activity tests and protein crystallization. The affinity purification step (nickel-Sepharose) was introduced in order to separate the recombinant (mutated) enzymes from the constitutive chromosomic E. coli IDI-1 and therefore to avoid interference in the enzymatic assays. Enzymatic activity of the two Tyr-104 mutants is greatly affected when compared with the wild-type enzyme as illustrated in Table 2. Replacement of the lateral chain of Tyr-104 by an alanine (Y104A) or a phenylalanine (Y104F) resulted in a dramatic decrease of enzymatic activity, with the mutants presenting less than 5% residual specific activity. Efficacy of the mutants is significantly reduced by a factor of 100 (Y104F, Vmax = 2.9 versus 260.7 mm·mg–1·h–1 for the WT enzyme) to 1000 (Y104A, Vmax = 0.14 versus 260.7 mm·mg–1·h–1 for the WT enzyme). This lowered activity clearly indicates that Tyr-104 is a key amino acid for the isomerization of IPP into DMAPP. In addition, determination of Km values shows that affinity of both Tyr-104 mutants to the substrate is affected by the deletion of the hydroxyl moiety (Y104A and Y104F, Km 22.5 and 14.2 versus 9.5 μm for the WT enzyme). It is therefore assumed that Tyr-104 plays a role in the substrate stabilization and the proper folding of the binding site.TABLE 2Kinetic parameters of wild-type and mutant E. coli IDI-1WT enzymeY104A mutantY104F mutantRelative activity (%)100 ± 6.60.1 ± 0.10.8 ± 0.3Km (μm)9.5 ± 4.322.5 ± 9.914.2 ± 0.2Vmax (mm·mg-1·h-1)260.7 ± 43.50.1 ± 0.042.9 ± 0.02 Open table in a new tab Crystallographic Structure of Y104A and Y104F Mutants of IDI-1—Crystals from the two mutants were grown using the hanging drop method. Crystals of the Y104F mutant were obtained in the presence of divalent cations. Their shape is similar to the one obtained with the WT enzyme (Fig. 1A), which belongs to the orthorhombic P212121 space group (a = 69.1, b = 72.2, and c = 91.6 Å). Crystals of the Y104A mutant appeared in similar crystallization conditions. In contrast to the Y104F protein, they exhibit a prismatic shape and belong to trigonal P3221 space group (a = b = 71.4, c = 61.8 Å) as the crystallographic structure of WT enzyme without any cation (Fig. 1, D and C, respectively). First, we refined the crystallographic structure of Y104F protein to 1.96 Å. The N-terminal residues fold into a small β-sheet of two anti-parallel strands as shown in Fig. 1B. This folding leads to the formation of the first metal (M2+)-binding site that coordinates His-25 and His-32 and brings them close to His-69, Glu-114, and Glu-116. A second metal site coordinates the carbonyl group of the highly conserved Cys-67 residue, the side chain oxygen (O-ϵ2) of Glu-87, and four water molecules to form an MO6 octahedral coordination sphere. Second, the structure of Y104A was refined to 1.76 Å (PDB code 1r67). No electron density is associated with the lateral chain of residue 104, consistent with replacement of the tyrosine by an alanine introduced by site-directed mutagenesis. The M2+ metal-binding site is absent in this structure, but Mg2+ is still present and is bound to Cys-67, Glu-87, and four water molecules (Fig. 1D). A comparison of the two mutants against the WT enzyme is presented in Table 3.TABLE 3Comparison of the general fold of wild-type (metal-bound and metal-free) E. coli IDI-1 against the mutated proteins (Y104A and Y104F)WT metal-boundWT metal-freeY104F mutantY104A mutantPDB code1hx31hzt2g741r67General foldCompletely folded, N-terminal region folded in β-sheetN-terminal region unfoldedCompletely folded, N-terminal region folded in β-sheetN-terminal region unfoldedM2+-binding siteMO6 coordination, His-25, His-32, His-69, Glu-114, and Glu-116AbsentMO6 coordination, His-25, His-32, His-69, Glu-114, and Glu-116AbsentMg2+-binding siteMO6 coordination, Cys-67, Glu-87, and 4 water moleculesMO6 coordination, Cys-67, Glu-87, and 4 water moleculesMO6 coordination, Cys-67, Glu-87, and 4 water moleculesMO6 coordination: Cys-67, Glu-87, and 4 water molecules Open table in a new tab Finally, a crystal of Y104F was soaked in order to obtain a complex between the mutated protein and EIPP, a mechanism-based irreversible inhibitor. Structure was refined to 1.97 Å. The general fold of the enzyme is similar to the one observed for the WT enzyme. Two non-bridging oxygens in the diphosphate moiety, the carbonyl group of the highly conserved Cys-67 residue, the side chain oxygen (O-ϵ2) of Glu-87, and two water molecules coordinate the second metal, involved in the stabilization of IPP, to form the same MO6 octahedral coordination sphere. Thermal Stability of the Mutated Proteins—Thermal denaturation of the enzymes was studied in order to compare the stability of the WT enzyme versus the mutated proteins. The thermal denaturations of the WT enzyme and the studied mutants were irreversible, under the experimental conditions used. Temperature of denaturation of the enzyme decreased by 20 °C when Tyr-104 is mutated into alanine (Td, 69 and 48 °C for WT and Y104A enzymes, respectively). Stability of the enzyme is less affected when the aromatic moiety is conserved (Td, 69 and 55 °C for WT and Y104F enzymes, respectively) clearly showing the importance of the lateral OH group of this residue (Fig. 2).

Nucleic Acids Res. 1994; 22: 4673-4680Crossref PubMed Scopus (55744) Google Scholar) show that a series of amino acids is strictly conserved among type 1 IDIs. Beside the conserved catalytic cysteine (Cys-67 in E. coli) and glutamic acid (Glu-116 in E. coli) residues, a few other amino acids are conserved in all aligned sequences (supplemental Fig. S1). Among those residues, His-25, His-32, His-69, Glu-114, and Glu-116 are part of the first (catalytic) metal cation-binding site (6Bonnano J.B. Edo C. Eswar N. Pieper U. Romanowski M.J. Ilyin V.

Residues Lys-21, Arg-51, Lys-55, and Arg-83 are involved in the stabilization of the diphosphate moiety of the ligand. Interestingly, Tyr-104 is another highly conserved residue (8Wouters J.

After mutation of Tyr-104 into alanine (Y104A) and phenylalanine (Y104F), we observed a reduced enzymatic activity (decreased Vm) and ligand affinity (increased Km). These results clearly indicate that Tyr-104 is a key amino acid for the isomerization of IPP into DMAPP and could play a role in the stabilization of the substrate into the binding site. For a second time we tried to validate this assumption by studying the crystallographic structure of the mutated proteins. The Y104F mutant presents a fold similar to the wild-type enzyme in the presence of metal cations. Therefore, mutation does not seem to affect the global conformation of the protein. Interestingly, a crystal form of the Y104A mutant, although obtained in the presence of divalent cations, is similar to the one obtained for the metal-free wild-type E. coli IDI-1 (PDB code 1hzt) (7Durbecq V. Sainz G. Oudjama Y. Clantin B. Bompard-Gilles C. Tricot C. Caillet J. Stalon V. Droogmans L. Villeret V. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 1530-1537Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). In this structure, the first 32 amino acids are not visible in the electron density maps revealing flexibility of this domain when the catalytic metal-binding site is not properly folded (Fig. 1D). A similar disorder of the N-terminal domain appears in the structure of the Y104A mutant. Therefore, mutation of Tyr-104 into an alanine seems to decrease the stability of the catalytic metal-binding site, even in the presence of metal cations in the solution (supplemental Fig. S2). To measure the stability of the mutants in comparison to the WT enzyme, thermal denaturation studies were carried out by UV spectroscopy (Fig. 2). The temperature of denaturation for Y104A and Y104F is significantly lowered compared with the WT value (Td, 69, 55, and 48 °C for WT, Y104F, and Y104A enzymes, respectively), suggesting that Tyr-104 is implied in the overall stability of IDI-1 folding as proposed by the crystallographic structure of Y104A. Based on this work, the role of Tyr-104 seems to be mainly structural. In order to check the conservation of the catalytic process, diffraction data were collected on a complex between Y104F mutant and a mechanism-based irreversible inhibitor, EIPP. The experimental electron density shows a covalent bond between one oxygen atom Oϵ1 of Glu-116 in the active site and carbon atom C-3 of the inhibitor (Fig. 3). Thus, the epoxide in EIPP reacted with a proton in order to be activated. This intermediate was then opened by Glu-116 (Scheme 2). Moreover, the crystal structure is consistent with a regiospecific attack of Oϵ1 of Glu-116 on C-3 of EIPP. At the same time, the stereospecificity of this reaction was carefully analyzed. The occupancy of two stereoisomers R and S was refined to 0.48/0.52 and 0.50/0.50 for both molecules in the asymmetric unit (supplemental Fig. S3). This confirms that the first step of the epoxide opening is the formation of a carbocationic transition state. The diphosphate group of the inhibitor is further stabilized by interactions with residues Arg-51, Lys-55, Glu-83, and Lys-21.SCHEME 2Regiospecific opening of the EIPP epoxide ring.

Indeed, even in the absence of the OH function at residue 104, the epoxide of EIPP is activated by the enzyme to further react with Glu-116. This suggests that Tyr-104 is not the proton donor in the active site of the enzyme and explains the residual enzymatic activity observed with the Tyr-104 mutants. In addition, the crystal structure of the Y104F mutant shows that not only the OH group of Tyr-104 stabilizes the active site of IDI-1 by H-bonding to Glu-116 but that additional stabilizing effects (van der Waals, stacking interaction) involve the aromatic ring. The acidic moiety providing the proton during isomerization of IPP into DMAPP catalyzed by IDI-1 is not yet identified. Multiple sequence alignments and geometrical features observed in crystal structures of complexes with E. coli IDI-1 suggest that Tyr-104 could play this important role during catalysis. Therefore, two mutants (Y104A and Y104F) were constructed by site-directed mutagenesis and purified. Enzymatic characterization of those mutants shows that over 95% of activity is lost when compared with the wild-type enzyme. Moreover, affinity (Km) for the substrate is significantly affected for Y104A, and efficacy (Vmax) of the mutants is reduced by a factor of 100 (Y104F) to 1000 (Y104A)."
