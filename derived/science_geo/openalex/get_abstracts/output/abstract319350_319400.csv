https://openalex.org/W1616665557,"The self-assembly of monodisperse gold and silver colloid particles into monolayers on polymer-coated substrates yields macroscopic surfaces that are highly active for surface-enhanced Raman scattering (SERS). Particles are bound to the substrate through multiple bonds between the colloidal metal and functional groups on the polymer such as cyanide (CN), amine (NH(2)), and thiol (SH). Surface evolution, which can be followed in real time by ultraviolet-visible spectroscopy and SERS, can be controlled to yield high reproducibility on both the nanometer and the centimeter scales. On conducting substrates, colloid monolayers are electrochemically addressable and behave like a collection of closely spaced microelectrodes. These favorable properties and the ease of monolayer construction suggest a widespread use for metal colloid-based substrates."

https://openalex.org/W2083085458,"Vibrations in a granular material can spontaneously produce convection rolls reminiscent of those seen in fluids. Magnetic resonance imaging provides a sensitive and noninvasive probe for the detection of these convection currents, which have otherwise been difficult to observe. A magnetic resonance imaging study of convection in a column of poppy seeds yielded data about the detailed shape of the convection rolls and the depth dependence of the convection velocity. The velocity was found to decrease exponentially with depth; a simple model for this behavior is presented here."
https://openalex.org/W2050142232,"The formation kinetics and self-assembly of multilamellar tubules of the diacetylenic phospholipid 1,2-bis(tricosa-10,12-diynoyl)-sn-glycerol-3-phosphocholine formed under controlled cooling rates were studied by x-ray diffraction and optical, atomic force, and scanning electron microscopy. Tubule formation was driven by a reversible first-order phase transition from an intralamellar, chain-melted L(alpha) phase to a chain-frozen L(beta), phase. These observations are the basis of a highly efficient method of tubule production in which tubule lengths can be controlled, between 1 and 100 micrometers, by varying the cooling rate. These tubules can be made in suspensions with 10 percent lipid by mass, far exceeding the lipid solubility limit."
https://openalex.org/W2105120932,"Aircraft measurements of solar flux in the cloudy tropical atmosphere reveal that solar absorption by clouds is anomalously large when compared to theoretical estimates. The ratio of cloud forcing at an altitude of 20 kilometers to that at the surface is 1.58 rather than 1.0, as predicted by models. These results were derived from a cloud radiation experiment in which identical instrumentation was deployed on coordinated stacked aircraft. These findings indicate a significant difference between measurements and theory and imply that the interaction between clouds and solar radiation is poorly understood."
https://openalex.org/W2045044336,"Studies of volcanic rocks in dredge hauls from the submerged parts of the Mid-Atlantic Ridge suggest that it consists largely of tholeiitic basalt with low values of K, Ti, and P. In contrast, the volcanic islands which form the elevated caps on the Ridge are built of alkali basalt with high values of Ti, Fe(3+), P, Na, and K. This distinct correlation between the form of the volcanic structures, elevation above the sea floor, and composition suggests that the islands of alkali basalt are derived from a parent tholeiitic magma by differentiation in shallow reservoirs. The volume of low-potassium tholeiites along the Mid-Atlantic Ridge and elsewhere in the oceans appears to be many times that of the alkali basalts exposed on oceanic islands. Tholeiitic basalts with about 0.2 K(2)O appear to be the primary and predominant magma erupted on the oceanic floor."
https://openalex.org/W1997540041,"New petrographic and chemical data indicate that the great Mount Mazama eruption at Crater Lake, Oregon, about 6600 years ago was the source of most ash which has been called ""Glacier Peak"" and of some ash called ""Galata."" Glacier Peak volcano in Washington was itself the source of an older ash deposit, perhaps very late glacial or early postglacial in age."

Previous theoretical determinations are discussed; Strøm's empirically determined figures are in agreement with these data."
https://openalex.org/W2006091904,Seeds of Pisum sativum L. and other species were germinated and grown for five or more days on a continuously rotating vertical-axis turntable that developed a maximum centrifugal force of 1.79(g). Shoot (epicotyl) orientation in darkness was parallel to the resultant gravitational field. This is presented as confirmation of the hypothesis that the orienting force of geotropism of the higher plants is the inertial force of gravity.
