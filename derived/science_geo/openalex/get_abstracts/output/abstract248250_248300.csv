https://openalex.org/W2034500416,"MicroRNAs are small noncoding RNAs that serve as posttranscriptional regulators of gene expression in higher eukaryotes. Their widespread and important role in animals is highlighted by recent estimates that 20%-30% of all genes are microRNA targets. Here, we report that a large set of genes involved in basic cellular processes avoid microRNA regulation due to short 3'UTRs that are specifically depleted of microRNA binding sites. For individual microRNAs, we find that coexpressed genes avoid microRNA sites, whereas target genes and microRNAs are preferentially expressed in neighboring tissues. This mutually exclusive expression argues that microRNAs confer accuracy to developmental gene-expression programs, thus ensuring tissue identity and supporting cell-lineage decisions."

The lack of a standard description format, lack of stringent reviewing and authors' carelessness are the main causes for incomplete model descriptions. With today's increased interest in detailed biochemical models, it is necessary to define a minimum quality standard for the encoding of those models. We propose a set of rules for curating quantitative models of biological systems. These rules define procedures for encoding and annotating models represented in machine-readable form. We believe their application will enable users to (i) have confidence that curated models are an accurate reflection of their associated reference descriptions, (ii) search collections of curated models with precision, (iii) quickly identify the biological phenomena that a given curated model or model constituent represents and (iv) facilitate model reuse and composition into large subcellular models."

Here, we demonstrate that post-Golgi membrane trafficking is polarized toward longer dendrites of hippocampal pyramidal neurons in vitro and toward apical dendrites in vivo. Small Golgi outposts partition selectively into longer dendrites and are excluded from axons. In dendrites, Golgi outposts concentrate at branchpoints where they engage in post-Golgi trafficking. Within the cell body, the Golgi apparatus orients toward the longest dendrite, and this Golgi polarity precedes asymmetric dendrite growth. Manipulations that selectively block post-Golgi trafficking halt dendrite growth in developing neurons and cause a shrinkage of dendrites in mature pyramidal neurons. Further, disruption of Golgi polarity produces neurons with symmetric dendritic arbors lacking a single longest principal dendrite.

Proper dendritic development is a prerequisite for appropriate formation of neural circuits (Jan and Jan, 2003Jan Y.N. Jan L.Y.

Rho GTPases and activity-dependent dendrite development.Curr. Opin. Neurobiol. 2004; 14: 297-304Crossref PubMed Scopus (193) Google Scholar) for dendritic outgrowth have been elucidated. An overlooked aspect of neuronal development is the addition of plasma membrane required to construct a complex surface area 10,000 times greater than typical animal cells, extending highly branched structures hundreds of microns from the cell body (Horton and Ehlers, 2004Horton A.C. Ehlers M.D. Secretory trafficking in neuronal dendrites.Nat. Cell Biol. 2004; 6: 585-591Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar). The major sites of synthesis of lipid and protein components of the plasma membrane are the organelles of the secretory pathway, including the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) and Golgi apparatus. How membrane trafficking through the secretory pathway is organized to support the formation and maintenance of complex asymmetric dendritic arbors remains obscure. A requirement for membrane trafficking in the formation of neuronal processes was initially indicated for the growth of axons (Jareb and Banker, 1997Jareb M. Banker G. Inhibition of axonal growth by brefeldin A in hippocampal neurons in culture.J. Neurosci. 1997; 17: 8955-8963Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). However, dendrites and axons are remarkable for their different morphological and functional properties, and an increasing body of work indicates that axonal and dendritic outgrowth are regulated by distinct mechanisms (Polleux et al., 2000Polleux F. Morrow T. Ghosh A. Semaphorin 3A is a chemoattractant for cortical apical dendrites.Nature. 2000; 404: 567-573Crossref PubMed Scopus (569) Google Scholar). Indeed, the axon and dendrites on a single neuron may have opposing responses to secreted guidance molecules such as semaphorin 3A, an effect that requires the polarized distribution of downstream signaling molecules (Polleux et al., 2000Polleux F. Morrow T. Ghosh A. Semaphorin 3A is a chemoattractant for cortical apical dendrites.Nature. 2000; 404: 567-573Crossref PubMed Scopus (569) Google Scholar). Further, during development, neurons may switch irreversibly from an axonal to a dendritic growth mode (Goldberg et al., 2002Goldberg J.L. Klassen M.P. Hua Y. Barres B.A. Amacrine-signaled loss of intrinsic axon growth ability by retinal ganglion cells.Science. 2002; 296: 1860-1864Crossref PubMed Scopus (362) Google Scholar), implying two distinct modes of outgrowth. Finally, although neurons typically have only a single axon, they usually have multiple dendrites that may be morphologically and functionally distinct from one another. For example, pyramidal neurons of the cerebral cortex and hippocampus have a single apical dendrite that extends hundreds of microns toward the pia and several smaller, shorter basolateral dendrites that receive distinct synaptic inputs (Whitford et al., 2002Whitford K.L. Dijkhuizen P. Polleux F. Ghosh A. Molecular control of cortical dendrite development.Annu. Rev. Neurosci. 2002; 25: 127-149Crossref PubMed Scopus (231) Google Scholar). The signaling cascades and trafficking pathways that specify axons versus dendrites are becoming clarified (de Anda et al., 2005de Anda F.C. Pollarolo G. Da Silva J.S. Camoletto P.G. Feiguin F.

In other cell types, directed secretory trafficking regulates the growth of plasma membrane domains involved in processes as diverse as yeast cell budding, immune cell function, and cell migration (Bergmann et al., 1983Bergmann J.E.

Recent studies have shown that the secretory pathway in neurons has a spatial distribution unique among mammalian cells (Gardiol et al., 1999Gardiol A. Racca C. Triller A. Dendritic and postsynaptic protein synthetic machinery.J. Neurosci. 1999; 19: 168-179Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, Horton and Ehlers, 2003Horton A.C.

Biol. 2001; 11: 351-355Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar). Rather than being a single-copy perinuclear organelle as in most cell types, the neuronal Golgi apparatus is instead composed of both Golgi stacks in the cell body and discrete Golgi “outposts” in dendrites. These dendritic Golgi outposts may be synapse-associated (Gardiol et al., 1999Gardiol A. Racca C. Triller A. Dendritic and postsynaptic protein synthetic machinery.J. Neurosci. 1999; 19: 168-179Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, Pierce et al., 2001Pierce J.P. Mayer T. McCarthy J.B. Evidence for a satellite secretory pathway in neuronal dendritic spines.Curr. Biol. 2001; 11: 351-355Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar), and their appearance in dendrites is developmentally regulated, with dendritic Golgi becoming evident during periods of rapid dendritic outgrowth and synapse formation (Horton and Ehlers, 2003Horton A.C. Ehlers M.D. Dual modes of endoplasmic reticulum-to-Golgi transport in dendrites revealed by live-cell imaging.J. Neurosci. 2003; 23: 6188-6199Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Notably, the number of dendritic ER exit sites, where secretory cargo buds from the ER en route to the Golgi, also increases during dendritic outgrowth (Aridor et al., 2004Aridor M. Guzik A.K. Bielli A. Fish K.N. Endoplasmic reticulum export site formation and function in dendrites.J. Neurosci. 2004; 24: 3770-3776Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar), and TGN organelles in dendrites localize at sites of neuron-neuron contact (Sytnyk et al., 2002Sytnyk V. Leshchyns'ka I. Delling M. Dityateva G. Dityatev A. Schachner M. Neural cell adhesion molecule promotes accumulation of TGN organelles at sites of neuron-to-neuron contacts.J. Cell Biol. 2002; 159: 649-661Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar). These observations point to the possibility that the spatial distribution of dendritic secretory elements may contribute to dendrite morphogenesis. Here, we investigate the spatial and temporal organization of secretory trafficking in dendrites and its role in dendrite growth and morphogenesis. Using a combination of live-cell imaging, electron microscopy, and quantitative morphometric analysis in cell culture, brain slices, and rodent brain, we demonstrate that post-Golgi secretory trafficking in neurons is polarized toward longer, more complex dendrites and is required for dendritic outgrowth. In hippocampal neurons, Golgi outposts localize selectively to dendritic branchpoints and are typically present in only one long dendrite, which in vivo is the apical dendrite. Within the cell body, the Golgi apparatus orients toward the longest dendrite, and post-Golgi secretory cargo is delivered predominantly toward this principal dendrite. This Golgi polarization precedes and is required for the formation of polarized dendritic arbors. Surprisingly, somatic Golgi has no polarity toward the axon; Golgi outposts are excluded from axons, and axonal outgrowth proceeds despite secretory pathway manipulations that prevent dendritic outgrowth, demonstrating specificity for anterograde secretory trafficking in the construction of dendritic, and not axonal, arbors. These results demonstrate an unanticipated spatial organization of neuronal secretory trafficking and identify polarized trafficking as a novel mechanism for asymmetric dendritic growth and morphogenesis. Discrete Golgi elements capable of transporting secretory cargo are present in dendrites (Horton and Ehlers, 2003Horton A.C. Ehlers M.D. Dual modes of endoplasmic reticulum-to-Golgi transport in dendrites revealed by live-cell imaging.J. Neurosci. 2003; 23: 6188-6199Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). To determine whether all dendrites or only a subset contain such Golgi outposts, we stained 10 day in vitro (DIV) hippocampal neurons for the dendritic marker MAP2 and for GM130, a marker of the cis-Golgi compartment (Figure 1A). Although the population of neurons examined had on average 5 ± 1.7 dendrites (n = 80), only one or two dendrites had detectable dendritic Golgi (Figure 1A, arrowheads). This selective localization of Golgi elements to single dendrites was readily observed in distal dendrites examined from individual neurons (Figure 1B). Quantitative analysis revealed that 70% of DIV 10 hippocampal neurons had dendritic Golgi. Of these, most had Golgi in only a single dendrite, with nearly all the remainder having Golgi elements in two dendrites (Figure 1C). Grouped together, 51% of DIV 10 hippocampal neurons had Golgi in a single dendrite, 19.5% had Golgi in two dendrites, and 29.5% had no dendritic Golgi (Figure 1C). The exclusion of Golgi from some dendrites was not due to the diameter of the proximal dendrite because dendrites of similar width on the same neurons could either contain (Figure 1B, left) or lack (Figure 1B, right) dendritic Golgi. Counting all dendrites together, only 17.7% possessed detectable Golgi outposts. This segregation of Golgi to particular dendrites is in sharp contrast to the distribution of other membrane bound organelles, including endoplasmic reticulum and ER exit sites (Aridor et al., 2004Aridor M. Guzik A.K. Bielli A. Fish K.N. Endoplasmic reticulum export site formation and function in dendrites.J. Neurosci. 2004; 24: 3770-3776Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar, Horton and Ehlers, 2003Horton A.C. Ehlers M.D. Dual modes of endoplasmic reticulum-to-Golgi transport in dendrites revealed by live-cell imaging.J. Neurosci. 2003; 23: 6188-6199Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), as well as endosomes and mitochondria (Figure S1), which are present in all dendrites. Golgi outposts were also detectable in apical dendrites of CA1 pyramidal neurons in adult rat hippocampus dual labeled for MAP2 and GM130 (Figure 1D). To examine the ultrastructure of dendritic Golgi in the adult brain, we performed immunogold electron microscopy on rat hippocampus. Discrete Golgi stacks labeled for GM130 were readily discernable in the proximal portions of pyramidal neuron apical dendrites, extending as far as 100 μm from the soma (Figure 1E), but were seldom observed in basolateral dendrites (data not shown). Thus, Golgi is present in only a small fraction of neuronal dendrites—typically only one per neuron. In pyramidal neurons in vivo, this is the apical dendrite. The Golgi provides a potential source of membrane components for localized cell growth (Prigozhina and Waterman-Storer, 2004Prigozhina N.L. Waterman-Storer C.M. Protein kinase D-mediated anterograde membrane trafficking is required for fibroblast motility.Curr. Biol. 2004; 14: 88-98Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar). To determine whether the presence of Golgi outposts predicts dendrite shape, we performed morphometric analysis of dendritic length and complexity. Inspection of individual neurons revealed that dendrites containing Golgi elements were longer and more complex than dendrites lacking Golgi (Figure 2A). Direct measurement revealed that Golgi was present in the longest dendrite on 86% of neurons. Further quantitative analysis showed that the presence of Golgi corresponded to a 3-fold increase in dendritic length (277 ± 16 μm versus 90 ± 4 μm, p < 0.001) (Figure 2B). Moreover, dendrites containing Golgi were more than twice as long as their longest counterpart lacking Golgi on the same cell (306 ± 6 μm versus 148 ± 10 μm, p < 0.001) (Figure 2C). Another morphological characteristic of mature neurons is the development of a highly branched dendritic arbor. To determine whether the spatial organization of neuronal Golgi was related to dendritic complexity, we counted the number of dendritic tips, finding that dendrites containing Golgi were more complex than dendrites lacking Golgi (6.0 ± 0.4 versus 2.4 ± 0.1 tips per dendrite, p < 0.001) (Figure 2D). Further, comparing the most complex dendrite with Golgi to the most complex dendrite without Golgi on the same neuron revealed an increase in complexity in those dendrites containing Golgi outposts (6.6 ± 0.4 versus 3.9 ± 0.3, p < 0.001) (Figure 2E). Together, these data show that the asymmetry of Golgi distribution corresponds to asymmetric patterns of dendritic outgrowth, with dendritic Golgi present in the longer, more complex dendrites. Although dendritic Golgi outposts are a conspicuous feature of pyramidal neurons (Figure 1C), somatic Golgi in the cell body makes up the majority of the total Golgi apparatus (Figure 1) (Horton and Ehlers, 2003Horton A.C. Ehlers M.D. Dual modes of endoplasmic reticulum-to-Golgi transport in dendrites revealed by live-cell imaging.J. Neurosci. 2003; 23: 6188-6199Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). To test whether the somatic Golgi polarizes toward longer dendrites, we analyzed the radial distribution of GM130-labeled cis-Golgi in the cell body (Figure S2). For this analysis, a line drawn between the center of mass of the neuronal soma and the emergence point of the longest dendrite was defined as θ = 0° (Figure 3A). The distribution of Golgi relative to the axis of the longest dendrite was then averaged across a population of neurons. This analysis revealed that in DIV 10 hippocampal neurons, the somatic Golgi was polarized toward the longest dendrite (Figure 3B). The probability of Golgi being located in the quadrant of the neuronal soma immediately adjacent to the emergence point of the longest dendrite was twice that of other regions of the cell body (Figure 3B, inset). To test whether this polarized organization of Golgi in the soma occurs in vivo, we examined the distribution of GM130-labeled cis-Golgi in pyramidal neurons in adult rat somatosensory cortex. In cortex and hippocampus, the longest dendrite of pyramidal neurons is the apical dendrite, which extends radially toward the pial surface. Staining for GM130 revealed that the Golgi apparatus of cortical pyramidal neurons extends into the proximal apical dendrite (Figure 3C). Such an extension was not observed in basolateral dendrites (data not shown). Quantitative analysis of Golgi orientation within the cell bodies of cortical pyramidal neurons showed a marked polarization of somatic Golgi toward the apical dendrite (Figure 3D). This orientation of the Golgi toward the apical dendrite resembles the orientation of somatic Golgi toward the longest dendrite in neurons in vitro (Figure 3E). Immunogold electron microscopy of hippocampal pyramidal neurons further demonstrated a selective concentration of GM130-labeled Golgi stacks at the exit zone of the apical dendrite (Figure 3F, left) but not in proximal basolateral dendrites (Figure 3F, right). Quantification of immunogold labeling for GM130 revealed a much higher density of labeling in proximal portions of apical dendrites than in basal dendrites (2.1 ± 0.3 versus 0.3 ± 0.1 particles/μm2, p < 0.001) (Figure 3G). Finally, we examined the Golgi distribution in GABAergic interneurons. Unlike glutamatergic pyramidal neurons, these neurons lack apical dendrites and have dendrites of more uniform length. We observed a nearly symmetric distribution of somatic Golgi in GABAergic neurons compared to cocultured glutamatergic neurons (compare Figure 3H with Figure 3B), demonstrating that Golgi polarity correlates with dendrite polarity. To determine whether Golgi polarization precedes and therefore predicts asymmetric dendritic growth, we examined the temporal relationship between Golgi polarization and dendritic outgrowth. We found that the polarized orientation of the somatic Golgi emerged as neurons differentiated in cell culture (Figures 3E and 4A) and preceded the appearance of dendritic asymmetry (Figure 4B). At DIV 5, neurons typically had several nearly equivalent dendrites (Figure 4B, left), and the Golgi in the soma concentrated near the longest of these dendrites (Figure 4A, left). By DIV 7, the mature polarized Golgi distribution was established (Figure 4A, middle), although the dendrites exhibited little polarity (Figure 4B, middle). By DIV 10, however, most neurons have clearly established a single longest dendrite (1°:2° dendrite ratio, 2.8 ± 0.3, n = 32) (Figure 4B, right), and the Golgi remained oriented to this longest dendrite (Figure 3C, shown again in Figure 4A, right, for ease of comparison). To determine whether the polarized spatial distribution of neuronal Golgi predicts patterns of secretory flux, we performed time-lapse imaging of post-Golgi secretory trafficking in live neurons. For these experiments, we used a green fluorescent protein (GFP)-tagged temperature-sensitive mutant of the vesicular stomatitis virus glycoprotein VSVG-GFP-ts045, hereafter referred to as VSVG-GFP. VSVG-GFP misfolds and is retained in the ER when cells are incubated at the nonpermissive temperature (40°C). On shifting to a permissive temperature, VSVG-GFP folds properly, exits the ER, and proceeds to the Golgi. Thus, secretory cargo can be visualized as a synchronous wave. To accumulate VSVG-GFP in the Golgi after exit from the ER, we shifted neurons from 40°C to 20°C, a temperature that allows VSVG-GFP to escape the ER, but inhibits budding from the Golgi (Matlin and Simons, 1983Matlin K.S. Simons K. Reduced temperature prevents transfer of a membrane glycoprotein to the cell surface but does not prevent terminal glycosylation.Cell. 1983; 34: 233-243Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (338) Google Scholar). After a 3 hr incubation at 20°C, VSVG-GFP was present predominantly in the neuronal soma, where it colocalized with GM130 (Figure S3), and also in puncta throughout the dendrites. After the 20°C incubation, neurons were imaged live at 32°C, a temperature at which post-Golgi trafficking is restored (Yeaman et al., 2004Yeaman C. Ayala M.I. Wright J.R. Bard F. Bossard C. Ang A. Maeda Y. Seufferlein T. Mellman I. Nelson W.J. Malhotra V. Protein kinase D regulates basolateral membrane protein exit from trans-Golgi network.Nat. Cell Biol. 2004; 6: 106-112Crossref PubMed Scopus (200) Google Scholar). Under these conditions, post-Golgi trafficking of VSVG-GFP-labeled carriers was readily observed (Movies S1 and S2). We found that VSVG-GFP was present in highly mobile carriers in the neuronal soma, as well as the proximal and distal dendrites, at all time points after release from the 20°C block. Post-Golgi traffic was particularly dense in the proximal dendrites, where individual vesicles were frequently observed moving from the neuronal soma outward into the dendrites (Figure 5A, arrowheads, and Movie S1). Consistent with our immunostaining for GM130 (Figures 3A and 3B), Golgi labeled by VSVG-GFP after 20°C block typically localized to the base of a single long dendrite (Figure 5A and data not shown). In our time-lapse experiments, we designated the dendrite emerging nearest the Golgi as the “oriented” dendrite and other dendrites as “nonoriented” dendrites. At a distance of 40 μm from the cell body, there was no difference in the width of oriented versus nonoriented dendrites (2.1 ± 0.1 versus 1.8 ± 0.1 μm, p > 0.05). Upon exit from the Golgi, carriers preferentially entered the oriented dendrite (Figure 5B). Even in more distal dendritic segments, post-Golgi carriers were consistently more numerous in the oriented dendrites at all time points following release from 20°C block (Figure 5C, arrowheads, and Figure 5D; see also Movies S2 and S3). This includes both anterograde (70%) and retrograde (30%) trafficking carriers. This count of total carriers likely underestimates the bias of post-Golgi traffic for the oriented dendrite because each neuron typically has only a single oriented dendrite and several nonoriented dendrites. Therefore, we normalized the total number of vesicles to the number of dendrites in each group and found a 4-fold greater secretory flux in oriented dendrites (Figure 5E). To corroborate these findings, we summed 600 frames of individual time-lapse experiments and observed an approximately 5-fold greater flux of VSVG-GFP in Golgi-oriented dendrites, relative to nonoriented dendrites (Figure 5F). These results demonstrate that post-Golgi secretory trafficking in hippocampal neurons is directed predominantly toward a single principal dendrite, supporting our hypothesis that the polarized spatial orientation of the Golgi leads to polarized secretory trafficking. The delivery of cargo for dendrite growth and maintenance requires navigation through the highly branched dendritic tree. Given the relationship between Golgi polarization and dendritic complexity (Figure 2), we hypothesized that Golgi structures in dendrites would be positioned to regulate protein sorting and membrane addition associated with the development of complex dendrites. To test this possibility, we used 20°C block of VSVG-GFP to accumulate and visualize labeled secretory cargo in the Golgi and TGN. We found that Golgi outposts are frequently located at dendritic branchpoints (Figures 6A and 6B). VSVG-GFP-labeled stable Golgi structures were present at the majority of 1° and 2° dendritic branches, as well as nearly 40% of 3° dendrites (Figures 6B and 6C). A comparison of the distribution of distances between Golgi elements and dendritic branchpoints, the distribution of distances between individual Golgi outposts, and the distribution of distances between branchpoints, revealed a strong bias for dendritic Golgi to appear at branch bifurcations (Figure 6D). Although outposts were not completely restricted to branchpoints (Table 1), outposts at branches were located in close proximity to the branch bifurcation, even in distal dendrites (Figure 6E). Immunogold labeling for GM130 in cortical pyramidal neurons revealed Golgi stacks at dendritic branches in vivo, with the trans face oriented for cargo delivery into the opposing branch (Figure 6F). Thus, Golgi outposts are positioned to accommodate dendritic sorting and trafficking between dendritic branches.Table 1Spatial Distribution of Dendritic Golgi OutpostsDistance from Soma (μm)20406080100>120% Golgi outposts at branches55 ± 1334 ± 1329 ± 1138 ± 1331 ± 1531 ± 14The percentage of Golgi outposts within 2 μm of a dendritic branchpoint is shown as a function of distance from the soma. Open table in a new tab The percentage of Golgi outposts within 2 μm of a dendritic branchpoint is shown as a function of distance from the soma. To gain a better understanding of the behavior of secretory trafficking at branchpoints, we performed time-lapse imaging experiments of post-Golgi secretory cargo by visualizing VSVG-GFP in dendrites (Movie S4). After release from 20°C block, VSVG-GFP collected in stable, stationary structures at branchpoints (Figure 6G). These stationary Golgi structures were distinct from the smaller mobile post-Golgi carriers that trafficked bidirectionally throughout the dendrites with velocities of 1.0 ± 0.1 μm/sec (Figure 6G). Kymograph analysis confirmed the immobile behavior of branchpoint Golgi (Figure 6H). In these traces, the stable Golgi elements appeared as thick, straight lines (Figure 6H, colored arrows), indicating an accumulation of VSVG-GFP that has not yet budded into the more mobile post-Golgi vesicles, which appeared as the thinner sloped dotted lines across the kymograph (black arrows). Small carriers of post-Golgi cargo were frequently observed to traffic between these stable Golgi elements (Figure 6G) and to bud from them (Figures 6I and 6J and Movie S5). Although secretory cargo exiting from somatic Golgi showed a clear bias toward entering the nearby “oriented” dendrites (Figure 5), we did not discern a similar bias for cargo to enter a particular dendritic branch. For example, in the experiment shown in Figures 6G and 6H, a vesicle entered branch B (green arrowheads) shortly after another vesicle trafficked into branch A (red arrowheads). We conclude that stable Golgi elements engaged in secretory trafficking reside at most dendritic branchpoints. These Golgi sorting stations provide an intracellular landmark of dendritic branching and suggest a role for post-Golgi trafficking in regulating dendrite complexity and controlling the transport of molecular components to specific dendrite branches. The above data show a strong correspondence and sequential temporal relationship between a polarized Golgi distribution, polarized secretory trafficking, and enhanced dendritic length and complexity, suggesting a causal relationship. To determine whether forward secretory trafficking is required for dendritic outgrowth, we inhibited secretory trafficking by treating developing neurons with brefeldin A (BFA), which reversibly disassembles the Golgi apparatus (Lippincott-Schwartz et al., 1989Lippincott-Schwartz J. Yuan L.C. Bonifacino J.S. Klausner R.D. Rapid redistribution of Golgi proteins into the ER in cells treated with brefeldin A: evidence for membrane cycling from Golgi to ER.Cell. 1989; 56: 801-813Ab"
https://openalex.org/W2141443763,"Although spontaneous activity occurs throughout the neocortex, its relation to the activity produced by external or sensory inputs remains unclear. To address this, we used calcium imaging of mouse thalamocortical slices to reconstruct, with single-cell resolution, the spatiotemporal dynamics of activity of layer 4 in the presence or absence of thalamic stimulation. We found spontaneous neuronal coactivations corresponded to intracellular UP states. Thalamic stimulation of sufficient frequency (>10 Hz) triggered cortical activity, and UP states, indistinguishable from those arising spontaneously. Moreover, neurons were activated in identical and precise spatiotemporal patterns in thalamically triggered and spontaneous events. The similarities between cortical activations indicate that intracortical connectivity plays the dominant role in the cortical response to thalamic inputs.

The fact that the deficit mainly occurs in peripheral vision suggests that reaching in foveal and extrafoveal vision rely on two different neural substrates. In the present study, we have directly tested this hypothesis by event-related fMRI in healthy subjects. Brain activity was measured when participants reached toward central or peripheral visual targets. Our results confirm the existence of two systems, differently modulated by the two conditions. Reaching in central vision involved a restricted network including the medial intraparietal sulcus (mIPS) and the caudal part of the dorsal premotor cortex (PMd). Reaching in peripheral vision activated in addition the parieto-occipital junction (POJ) and a more rostral part of PMd. These results show that reaching to the peripheral visual field engages a more extensive cortical network than reaching to the central visual field.

These results show that reaching to the peripheral visual field engages a more extensive cortical network than reaching to the central visual field. Reaching for an object in visual space is an effortless process that nevertheless engages complex control systems in the posterior parietal cortex. Visually guided hand movements are naturally performed in two conditions. Optimal accuracy is obtained when hand movements are combined with eye movements, and subjects grasp an object after foveal capture. However, hand movements can also be made, albeit with less accuracy, without eye movements such as when one reaches for a cup of coffee while continuing to read the newspaper. One explanation for the decreased accuracy when reaching to objects in the peripheral visual field could lie in the lower spatial resolution of peripheral vision. Another possibility is that the cerebral networks engaged in central and peripheral reaching are distinct. This is suggested by the fact that a category of localized lesions in the posterior parietal cortex, centered on the parieto-occipital junction (POJ), give rise to a specific deficit of visually guided behavior referred to as optic ataxia (Karnath and Perenin, 2005Karnath H.O. Perenin M.T. Cortical control of visually guided reaching: evidence from patients with optic ataxia.Cereb. Cortex. 2005; 15: 1561-1569Crossref PubMed Scopus (254) Google Scholar). Patients with optic ataxia exhibit gross directional errors when reaching for objects located in the peripheral visual field, whereas misreaching largely disappears if the patient performs a saccadic eye movement toward the object (Karnath and Perenin, 2005Karnath H.O. Perenin M.T. Cortical control of visually guided reaching: evidence from patients with optic ataxia.Cereb. Cortex. 2005; 15: 1561-1569Crossref PubMed Scopus (254) Google Scholar, Perenin and Vighetto, 1988Perenin M.T. Vighetto A. Optic ataxia: a specific disruption in visuo-motor mechanisms. I. Different aspects of the deficit reaching for objects.Brain. 1988; 111: 643-674Crossref PubMed Scopus (646) Google Scholar). Functional imaging studies have not yet addressed the issue of the cortical networks involved in central and peripheral reaching. We have therefore looked for the existence of distinct reaching networks with an event-related fMRI paradigm on healthy subjects. Participants were scanned while reaching to a visual target. Two conditions were examined: (1) reaching to the target while making an orientation saccade and (2) reaching to the target without an orientation saccade. In condition (1) reaching movement is performed in central vision, whereas in (2) it is performed in peripheral vision. The presence of a saccade in condition (1), but not (2), raises a problem. It is generally thought that reaching accuracy is influenced by two variables: the presence or absence of eye movements and the peripheral versus central location of the visual target. However, the contribution that either variable alone makes to reaching accuracy remains unclear. For instance, although eye-position signals are known to influence the cortical reach-related network (Andersen and Buneo, 2002Andersen R.A. Buneo C.A. Intentional maps in posterior parietal cortex.Annu. Rev. Neurosci. 2002; 25: 189-220Crossref PubMed Scopus (906) Google Scholar, Boussaoud et al., 1998Boussaoud D. Jouffrais C. Bremmer F.

Neurosci. 2000; 20: 5835-5840PubMed Google Scholar), psychophysical studies argue against the execution of a saccade playing a critical role in the control of visually guided hand movements (Prablanc et al., 1979Prablanc C. Echallier J.F. Komilis E. Jeannerod M. Optimal response of eye and hand motor systems in pointing at a visual target. I.

Gauthier G.M. Eye-head-hand coordination in pointing at visual targets: spatial and temporal analysis.Exp. Brain Res. 1994; 99: 507-523Crossref PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar). These studies show that there is no increase in reaching accuracy in conditions where subjects had to direct the eyes toward a briefly presented target, compared to reaching without saccades. To examine if there are differences in the cortical activation patterns in central and peripheral reaching, it therefore is necessary to isolate the effects of central/peripheral location of visual target and presence/absence of accompanying eye movements. To achieve this goal, we designed a third condition consisting of a hybrid task in which subjects had to look and reach to a briefly presented target. However, because in this condition, the target was rapidly extinguished, the saccade did not lead to foveal capture, and hence the target was only seen in peripheral vision. The contrast of activity patterns resulting from the hybrid reaching condition with the other reaching tasks is critical for distinguishing the two hypotheses concerning the possible difference in cortical activation patterns: (1) that it depends on retinal position of the target or (2) that it depends on the occurrence of a saccade. If the retinal position of the target is the determinant parameter for the cortical activation pattern, then the posterior parietal cortex (and particularly POJ) should be similarly activated in the two peripheral-vision reaching tasks. If however saccades play a determinant role, there should be an identical involvement of the posterior parietal cortex in the two reaching with saccade tasks. Our results reveal that the determinant parameter is the foveal capture of the target. Two different cortical systems are involved in reaching in the central and peripheral visual field respectively. We show that compared to central reaching, reaching to a peripheral-located target activates significantly more the medial part of POJ and a rostral part of the dorsal premotor cortex (PMd). In contrast, a medial intraparietal area (mIPS) and the caudal part of PMd were activated irrespective of the retinal location of the target. In addition, we show that saccades are not responsible for the observed differences in cortical activation patterns in central and peripheral reaching. The determinant factor is the foveal capture of the target. If the target is not “grasped” by the fovea, then POJ shows increased levels of activation and activation of PMd is more widespread. In three experimental conditions, participants are required to reach to a target appearing in their peripheral visual field (see Figure 1). In two conditions, subjects are allowed to accompany their hand-reaching movement with an orientation saccade. In the first condition, the target remains visible throughout the whole trial and is thus captured by the fovea. We refer to this experimental (e) condition as reaching to a Visible Target after Saccade (VT/Se). In a second condition, the target disappears before the foveal capture. We refer to this condition as reaching to an Invisible Target after Saccade (IT/Se). In a third condition, the target remains visible during the whole trial, but subjects are not allowed to make a saccade. We refer to this condition as reaching to a Visible Target with No Saccade (VT/NSe). Each of these experimental reaching conditions (VT/Se, IT/Se and VT/NSe) are controlled (c) by conditions in which visual stimulation is identical, but participants are instructed to either orient their eyes toward the target (VT/Sc and IT/Sc) or to displace covert attention (VT/NSc). To ensure that each task is performed correctly, subjects undergo training, and eye movements are recorded in the scanner. Simple main effects of reaching are shown on Figure 2 and Table 1. The reaching movement in the VT/S task (VT/Se-VT/Sc) activated the left motor and somatosensory cortex, corresponding to movement of the right hand. In the frontal lobe, the medial frontal gyrus was activated bilaterally in the supplementary motor area (SMA), and the caudal part of the precentral region (the most caudal part of PMd) was activated on the left hemisphere. In the posterior parietal cortex, there was a bilateral activation of the medial bank of the intraparietal sulcus. The peak of activation of this “mIPS” region was found on Talairach's coordinates x = −30, y = −47, z = 61 (Z = 4.24) in the left hemisphere and x = 34, y = −48, z = 61 (Z = 3.71) in the right hemisphere.Table 1Reaching-Related Regions in the Three TasksCoordinatesContrastxyzZ ScoreRegionVT/Se − VT/Sc−38−22535.83Left central sulcus−34−24605.24Left precentral gyrus−4−13564.59Left medial frontal gyrus−2−67143.57Left cuneus0−79223.57Right cuneus−48−2594.03Left superior temporal gyrus−30−47614.24Left medial intraparietal sulcus34−48613.71Right medial intraparietal sulcus−36−11474.37Right superior frontal gyrus12−17434.07Right cingulate gyrusIT/Se − IT/Sc−36−23536.63Left central sulcus−32−16664.18Left precentral gyrus26−22645.12Right precentral gyrus−32−28646.53Left postcentral gyrus36−29403.81Right postcentral gyrus−2−15495.81Left medial frontal gyrus−46−2595.33Left superior temporal gyrus−18−79434.86Left parieto-occipital junction16−79434.08Right parieto-occipital junction18−72504.10Right precuneus−4−7823.97Left lingual gyrus2−74−84.58Right lingual gyrus−22−49614.32Left medial intraparietal sulcus24−53623.84Right medial intraparietal sulcus−49−28253.85Left inferior parietal lobule36−37424.21Right inferior parietal lobuleVT/NSe − VT/NSc−38−25536.44Left central sulcus−34−11433.88Left precentral gyrus26−14634.24Right precentral gyrus−32−40616.60Left postcentral gyrus28−36554.73Right postcentral gyrus8−3634.02Right medial frontal gyrus−42−6884.59Left middle temporal gyrus−16−74443.87Left parieto-occipital junction10−82373.74Right parieto-occipital junction−22−52663.96Left medial intraparietal sulcus30−53583.42Right medial intraparietal sulcus−2−7624.03Left lingual gyrus14−64−124.55Right lingual gyrusCoordinates (x, y, z) are expressed within the Talairach coordinate system: voxel level p < 0.001, cluster level p < 0.05 corrected.

The reaching movement in the IT/S task (IT/Se-IT/Sc) revealed a bilateral activation in the SMA and a unilateral activation in the left central sulcus and precentral gyrus. Activation of the precentral gyrus was larger than in the task above and extended anteriorly to a more rostral part of PMd up to the precentral sulcus. In the parietal lobe, there was a bilateral activation of the postcentral gyrus and upper part of posterior parietal cortex, with a peak in mIPS for the latter region at x = −22, y = −49, z = 61 (Z = 4.32) in the left hemisphere and x = 24, y = −53, z = 62 (Z = 3.84) in the right hemisphere. Unlike the VT/S task, another parietal region, POJ, was additionally activated. This activation was bilateral, extensive and located along the parieto-occipital junction with a local maximum at x = −18, y = −79, z = 43 (Z = 4.86) in the left hemisphere and x = 16, y = −79, z = 43 (Z = 4.08) in the right hemisphere. The reaching movement in the VT/NS task (VT/NSe-VT/NSc) revealed a network similar to that described above. In addition to bilateral SMA and left central sulcus, activations of rostral and caudal parts of PMd were observed on both hemispheres. In the parietal lobe, mIPS and POJ were also activated bilaterally. In this task, mIPS had a local maximum at x = −22, y = −52, z = 66 (Z = 3.96) in the left hemisphere and x = 30, y = −53, z = 58 (Z = 3.42) in the right hemisphere. Coordinates of POJ were x = −16, y = −74, z = 44 (Z = 3.87) in the left hemisphere and x = 10, y = −82, z = 37 (Z = 3.74) in the right hemisphere. Direct comparisons between these tasks enable us to test the two main hypotheses concerning cortical activation patterns (see Introduction). First, we examined the interaction between reaching and peripheral vision of the target with the simple main effects of reaching in the two tasks involving saccades, IT/S and VT/S (interaction was masked by the simple main effect of reaching [IT/Se − IT/Sc]). Modulation of reaching by removing saccade ([IT/Se − IT/Sc] − [VT/Se − VT/Sc]) revealed activation of POJ in the left (x = −10, y = −90, z = 36; Z = 3.85) and in the right hemisphere (x = 16, y = −84, z = 37; Z = 4.18). There were also clusters of activation in the left precentral gyrus, the right inferior parietal lobule, the left middle frontal gyrus, the left precuneus, and the left postcentral gyrus (see Figure 3A and Table 2). The interaction between reaching and saccade ([IT/Se − IT/Sc] − [VT/NSe − VT/NSc]) did not lead to any significant clusters of activation (p < 0.001 uncorrected).Table 2Direct Comparisons between TasksCoordinatesContrastxyzZ ScoreRegionEffect of the retinal position of the target[IT/Se − IT/Sc] − [VT/Se − VT/Sc]16−84374.18Right parieto-occipital junction34−37413.98Right inferior parietal lobule−10−90363.85Left parieto-occipital junction−20−22673.79Left precentral gyrus−24−12613.73Left middle frontal gyrus−12−79453.54Left precuneus22−49633.35Right postcentral gyrusEffect of the saccade[IT/Se − IT/Sc] − [VT/NSe − VT/NSc]No suprathreshold clustersCoordinates (x, y, z) are expressed within the Talairach coordinate system: voxel level p < 0.001, extent threshold of 5 voxels.

VT/Sc, saccade to visible target; IT/Sc, saccade to invisible target; VT/NSc, attention shift to visible target. To determine reach-related regions common to the two peripheral-vision tasks (IT/S and VT/NS), we performed a Boolean intersection of the simple main effects of reaching ([IT/Se − IT/Sc] AND [VT/NSe − VT/NSc]). This analysis (Figure 3B) confirmed that left PMd (rostral and caudal part), bilateral mIPS, and bilateral POJ were common to these reaching tasks (for each map: voxel level p < 0.001, cluster level p < 0.05 corrected). Whole-brain analysis revealed that mIPS and the more caudal part of PMd were activated in all tasks, whereas POJ and a rostral part of PMd were only significantly more involved when reaching was performed in peripheral vision. Hence, it suggests that it is the position of the target relative to the fovea and not the saccade that is the determinant parameter. To confirm this observation and perform direct comparisons between tasks in these regions, we used a region of interest (ROI) approach for each subject. Based on the frontal and parietal reach-related regions obtained in the VT/NS task (contrast [VT/NSe − VT/NSc]), we defined three bilateral ROIs, mIPS, POJ, and PMd (see Experimental Procedures). We measured the average β weights (as indices of effect size) for all conditions in the two tasks with saccade (VT/S and IT/S) (Figure 4). To determine whether the position of the target (i.e., inside or outside the fovea) influenced regions involved in the control of reaching movement, we compared the two reaching conditions relative to their respective controls (i.e., [IT/Se − IT/Sc] versus [VT/Se − VT/Sc]) in each ROI. One-tailed paired t tests (with the false discovery rate procedure for multiple comparisons) revealed that only two bilateral ROIs were more active during reaching in peripheral (IT/Se − IT/Sc) compared to central visual field (VT/Se − VT/Sc), POJ (left hemisphere p = 0.015, right hemisphere p = 0.024) and PMd (left hemisphere p = 0.019, right hemisphere p = 0.004). The bilateral mIPS region was not modulated by this factor (left hemisphere p = 0.325, right hemisphere p = 0.295). Although both POJ and PMd are influenced by Task, our previous analyses had shown that PMd was activated in all tasks, whereas POJ was significantly more activated when reaching was performed in peripheral vision. In fact, the Task effect appeared to influence the extent of PMd activation. In order to confirm this observation, we calculated the number of voxels activated in the precentral gyrus for the simple main effects of reaching in the three tasks (VT/S, IT/S, and VT/NS). In the left hemisphere, this analysis showed that 3560 mm3 of the precentral region (PrC) was activated during the reaching movement in the VT/S task (with saccade), 7192 mm3 during the IT/S task, and 6452 mm3 during the VT/NS task. In the right hemisphere, no activated voxel was found in the VT/S, 584 mm3 in IT/S and 448 mm3 in VT/NS (Figure 4). To describe in greater details this phenomenon subject per subject, we performed the same type of analysis in the left and right PrC for each of the twelve subjects (see Experimental Procedures). Here, we compare the volumes (Vol) activated in the IT/S and VT/S reaching tasks (Vol[IT/Se − IT/Sc] − Vol[VT/Se − VT/Sc]) so as to isolate the “peripheral-vision effect” and the volumes activated in the IT/S and VT/NS tasks (Vol[IT/Se − IT/Sc] − Vol[VT/NSe − VT/NSc]) so as to isolate the “saccade effect.” This shows that the “peripheral-vision effect” modulates significantly more the extent of PMd than does the “saccade effect” in the left (one-tailed Wilcoxon test, p = 0.016) but not in the right hemisphere (one-tailed Wilcoxon test, p = 0.145) (Figure 5, right). This is the first demonstration that the reach-related pattern of brain activity is dependent on the central versus peripheral location of the target. The present results indicate that visually guided reaching movements involve a well-defined fronto-parietal network. This network is composed of cortical areas commonly activated in all three tasks: the central sulcus, the SMA, the caudal part of PMd in the left hemisphere, and mIPS bilaterally. These results agree with previous imaging studies of visually guided reaching movements (Astafiev et al., 2003Astafiev S.V. Shulman G.L. Stanley C.M. Snyder A.Z. Essen D.C.V. Corbetta M.

Reaching for a visual target in the peripheral field engages a more extensive network in both hemispheres than reaching in central vision. In addition to activate areas engaged in central visual reaching, reaching in the peripheral visual field activates significantly more the area POJ located on both banks of the parieto-occipital sulcus. In the frontal cortex, the extent of PMd activity depends on the reaching condition. Activation in PMd is larger when reaching toward peripheral compared to central-located targets independently of whether the hand movement is accompanied by an eye movement. The present results reveal two distinct reach-related parietal regions, one influenced by the central versus peripheral visual location of the target (POJ) and the other (mIPS) is activated independently of target location. These findings shed light on apparent discrepancies of published findings from imaging studies. PET studies employing free-gaze reaching movement paradigms indicate specific activation patterns in the intraparietal sulcus and the superior parietal lobule (Desmurget et al., 2001Desmurget M.

In contrast, most fMRI studies with an imposed gaze fixation paradigm suggest activity patterns in a more medial and posterior region of the parietal lobe in addition to those obtained in free-gaze conditions (Astafiev et al., 2003Astafiev S.V.

Relating our findings with monkey data is difficult because of the lack of corresponding experiments in monkey. Given the different sites and patterns of activation found in the present study, the reaching-specific regions mIPS and POJ appear as likely homologs of the macaque areas MIP (Colby and Goldberg, 1999Colby C.L.

https://openalex.org/W1998139699,"Voltage-gated sodium channels are concentrated in myelinated nerves at the nodes of Ranvier flanked by paranodal axoglial junctions. Establishment of these essential nodal and paranodal domains is determined by myelin-forming glia, but the mechanisms are not clear. Here, we show that two isoforms of Neurofascin, Nfasc155 in glia and Nfasc186 in neurons, are required for the assembly of these specialized domains. In Neurofascin-null mice, neither paranodal adhesion junctions nor nodal complexes are formed. Transgenic expression of Nfasc155 in the myelinating glia of Nfasc-/- nerves rescues the axoglial adhesion complex by recruiting the axonal proteins Caspr and Contactin to the paranodes. However, in the absence of Nfasc186, sodium channels remain diffusely distributed along the axon. Our study shows that the two major Neurofascins play essential roles in assembling the nodal and paranodal domains of myelinated axons; therefore, they are essential for the transition to saltatory conduction in developing vertebrate nerves."

We show here that geniculocortical mapping is imprecise when the waves of spontaneous activity in the retina during the first postnatal week are disrupted genetically. This anatomical mapping defect is present by postnatal day 8 and has functional consequences, as revealed by optical imaging and microelectrode recording in adults. Pharmacological disruption of these retinal waves during the first week phenocopies the mapping defect, confirming both the site and the timing of the disruption in neural activity responsible for the defect. Analysis shows that the geniculocortical miswiring is not a trivial or necessary consequence of the retinogeniculate defect. Our findings demonstrate that disrupting early spontaneous activity in the eye alters thalamic connections to the cortex."

Proteolytic cleavage of p35, a regulatory subunit of Cdk5, by calpain results in the generation of the truncated p25 protein, which causes hyperactivation of Cdk5. Using region-specific and inducible transgenic mice, we show that transiently increased p25 expression in the hippocampus enhanced long-term potentiation (LTP) and facilitated hippocampus-dependent memory. Moreover, p25 expression increased the number of dendritic spines and synapses. Importantly, enhanced memory achieved by a transient expression of p25 followed by its repression did not cause neurodegeneration. In contrast, prolonged p25 production caused severe cognitive deficits, which were accompanied by synaptic and neuronal loss and impaired LTP.

Cdk5 is a protein serine/threonine kinase that is critical for the development of the central nervous system (Ohshima et al., 1996Ohshima T. Ward J.M. Huh C.G. Longenecker G. Veeranna Pant H.C. Brady R.O. Martin L.J. Kulkarni A.B. Targeted disruption of the cyclin-dependent kinase 5 gene results in abnormal corticogenesis, neuronal pathology and perinatal death.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 1996; 93: 11173-11178Crossref PubMed Scopus (770) Google Scholar). Two related neuron-specific proteins, p35 and p39, are necessary and sufficient to activate Cdk5 upon direct binding (Dhavan and Tsai, 2001Dhavan R. Tsai L.H. A decade of CDK5.Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2001; 2: 749-759Crossref PubMed Scopus (904) Google Scholar). In addition to its function during development, there is emerging evidence for a role of Cdk5 in the adult brain. It has been shown that Cdk5 activity within the nucleus accumbens counteracts the effects of cocaine in mice (Bibb et al., 2001Bibb J.A. Chen J. Taylor J.R. Svenningsson P. Nishi A. Snyder G.L. Yan Z. Sagawa Z.K. Ouimet C.C. Nairn A.C. et al.Effects of chronic exposure to cocaine are regulated by the neuronal protein Cdk5.Nature. 2001; 410: 376-380Crossref PubMed Scopus (402) Google Scholar). Cdk5 activity has also been linked to dopamine signaling within the striatum (Bibb et al., 1999Bibb J.A. Snyder G.L. Nishi A. Yan Z. Meijer L. Fienberg A.A. Tsai L.H. Kwon Y.T. Girault J.A. Czernik A.J. et al.Phosphorylation of DARPP-32 by Cdk5 modulates dopamine signalling in neurons.Nature. 1999; 402: 669-671Crossref PubMed Scopus (474) Google Scholar). In addition, pharmacological inhibition of septo-hippocampal Cdk5 activity impairs associative learning in mice (Fischer et al., 2002Fischer A. Sananbenesi F. Schrick C. Spiess J. Radulovic J. Cyclin-dependent kinase 5 is required for associative learning.J. Neurosci. 2002; 22: 3700-3707Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and affects LTP (Li et al., 2001Li B.S. Sun M.K. Zhang L. Takahashi S. Ma W. Vinade L. Kulkarni A.B. Brady R.O. Pant H.C. Regulation of NMDA receptors by cyclin-dependent kinase-5.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2001; 98: 12742-12747Crossref PubMed Scopus (219) Google Scholar). Furthermore, a number of synaptic substrates of Cdk5 have been identified (for review see Fischer et al., 2003Fischer A.

Several studies implicated Cdk5 with synaptic-vesicle endocytosis (Tan et al., 2003Tan T.C. Valova V.A. Malladi C.S. Graham M.E. Berven L.A. Jupp O.J. Hansra G. McClure S.J. Sarcevic B.

USA. 2004; 101: 546-551Crossref PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar), while phosphorylation of PSD-95 by Cdk5 is implicated in NMDA receptor clustering (Morabito et al., 2004Morabito M.A. Sheng M.

Neurosci. 2004; 24: 865-876Crossref PubMed Scopus (180) Google Scholar). Taken together, these results reveal a potential role of Cdk5 in synaptic plasticity and learning and memory in the adult. Cdk5 activity is increased in postmortem brain samples of AD patients (Lee et al., 1999Lee K.Y. Clark A.W. Rosales J.L. Chapman K. Fung T. Johnston R.N. Elevated neuronal Cdc2-like kinase activity in the Alzheimer disease brain.Neurosci. Res. 1999; 34: 21-29Crossref PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar), probably due to the conversion of the Cdk5 activator p35 to the truncated p25 protein. Consistently elevated p25 levels are observed in postmortem brain samples of human AD patients (Patrick et al., 1999Patrick G.N. Zukerberg L. Nikolic M. de la Monte S. Dikkes P. Tsai L.H.

Conversion of p35 to p25 deregulates Cdk5 activity and promotes neurodegeneration.Nature. 1999; 402: 615-622Crossref PubMed Scopus (1262) Google Scholar), and inducible p25 transgenic (CK-p25) mice that express p25 in the postnatal forebrain exhibit profound neurodegeneration, astrogliosis, and tau-associated pathology (Cruz et al., 2003Cruz J.C. Tseng H.C. Goldman J.A. Shih H. Tsai L.H. Aberrant Cdk5 activation by p25 triggers pathological events leading to neurodegeneration and neurofibrillary tangles.Neuron. 2003; 40: 471-483Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (470) Google Scholar). Given that neurodegeneration is often preceded by cognitive deficits, we employed CK-p25 mice to analyze the effects of aberrant Cdk5 activity on synaptic plasticity and learning and memory. We found that prolonged p25 expression dramatically impaired hippocampal LTP and memory with accompanying synaptic and neuronal loss. Surprisingly, we show that transient p25 expression profoundly enhanced hippocampal LTP and facilitated learning and memory. In addition, transient p25 production increased dendritic spine density and the number of synapses. Notably, facilitated learning induced by transient p25 expression did not cause neurodegeneration. Thus, a prolonged expression of p25 may turn a physiological action of Cdk5 into a pathological one. We utilized bitransgenic mice in which inducible GFP-tagged human p25 expression is mediated by the CamKII promoter (CK) regulated tet-off system. In bitransgenic Ck-p25 mice, p25 expression is repressed in the presence of doxycycline. We reported that these mice exhibit neurodegeneration and tau-associated pathology upon p25 induction (Cruz et al., 2003Cruz J.C. Tseng H.C. Goldman J.A. Shih H. Tsai L.H. Aberrant Cdk5 activation by p25 triggers pathological events leading to neurodegeneration and neurofibrillary tangles.Neuron. 2003; 40: 471-483Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (470) Google Scholar). However, the initial clinical manifestations observed in neurodegenerative diseases such as AD are often cognitive impairments. Similarly, several mouse models for neurodegenerative diseases display cognitive deficits in learning paradigms such as the Morris water maze test (Ashe, 2001Ashe K.H. Learning and memory in transgenic mice modeling Alzheimer's disease.Learn. Mem. 2001; 8: 301-308Crossref PubMed Scopus (210) Google Scholar) and fear conditioning (Dineley et al., 2002Dineley K.T. Xia X. Bui D. Sweatt J.D. Zheng H. Accelerated plaque accumulation, associative learning deficits, and up-regulation of alpha 7 nicotinic receptor protein in transgenic mice co-expressing mutant human presenilin 1 and amyloid precursor proteins.J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 22768-22780Crossref PubMed Scopus (196) Google Scholar). These results prompted us to test learning and memory in mice that overexpress p25 for different lengths of time. Robust p25 expression and elevated hippocampal Cdk5 activity was observed 1–2 weeks after induction (see Figure S1A in the Supplemental Data available online). Increased immunoreactivity for glial acid fibrillary protein (GFAP), indicating astrogliosis that often accompanies neuronal loss, was first observed 4 weeks after p25 induction within the hippocampus and cortex (Figure S1B). Significant brain atrophy and loss of hippocampal neurons was, however, first observed 6 weeks after p25 induction (Figures S1C and S1D). Because significant neurodegeneration was observed in mice with 6 weeks of p25 induction but not in those with 2 weeks of induction, we decided to analyze the learning behavior of the CK-p25 mice after induction for 2 and 6 weeks, respectively. Bitransgenic CK-p25 mice were kept on doxycycline food continuously until 6 weeks after birth. In the first set of experiments, doxycycline was withdrawn for an additional 6 weeks before the mice (n = 7/group) were subjected to context- and tone-dependent fear conditioning (Figure 1A). When tested 24 hr later, the CK-p25 mice showed dramatically reduced context (p < 0.0001, t1,12 = 7.434) and tone-dependent (p = 0.0010, t1,12 = 4.316) freezing behavior when compared to control mice (Figure 1B). This reduction in freezing was not due to impaired pain sensation, as the response to the electric foot shock during the training was similar in CK-p25 and control mice (Figure 1C). Moreover, the explorative behavior during exposure to the novel context was not different among groups (Figure 1D). Notably, CK-p25 mice showed no deficits in motor coordination, as the performance in the rotarod test was not significantly different from that of control mice (Figure 1E). Thus, 6 weeks of p25 expression severely impairs the ability of mice to form new memories. In the second set of experiments, p25 expression was induced for only 2 weeks before the mice were subjected to context- and tone-dependent fear conditioning (Figure 1A). Surprisingly, the CK-p25 mice (n = 17) showed significantly enhanced context-dependent freezing when compared to the control group (n = 11; p = 0.0036, t1,26 = −3.206). Tone-dependent freezing behavior was not significantly different between the two groups (Figure 1B). As pain sensation (Figure 1C), explorative behavior (Figure 1D), and motor coordination (Figure 1E) were not different among groups, these data suggest that p25 production for 2 weeks significantly facilitates associative learning and memory. It is noteworthy that the enhanced context-dependent memory was more obvious in the female (p = 0.002 versus control) than the male CK-p25 mice (p = 0.048 versus control; data not shown). A small but significant deficit in associative memory was observed when animals were subjected to fear conditioning 4 weeks after doxycycline withdrawal (Figure S2). At this time point, astrogliosis was detected, but neuronal loss was not significant (Figures S1B and S1C). Similar biphasic (increase followed by decrease) changes in fear memory were also observed in a separate line of bitransgenic CK-p25 mice expressing p25-GFP at lower levels (the CK-p25LE line, where LE stands for “low expression”; see Figure S3). Notably, CK-single, p25-single, wild-type (wt), and noninduced CK-p25 mice that were continuously fed with doxycycline displayed similar context- and tone-dependent acquisition of fear memories, demonstrating that the insertion of the CK, p25 transgene, or both in doxycyline-fed CK-p25 mice did not alter learning and memory (Figure S4A), suggesting that the phenotypes observed in induced CK-p25 mice were due to p25 production. Furthermore, baseline anxiety (Figure S4B) was not significantly altered 2 or 6 weeks after p25 induction. To further test the effects of transient and prolonged p25 expression, we employed the Morris water maze paradigm to examine hippocampal-dependent spatial learning. As the water maze test requires multiple trainings in a period of 10–14 days and neurodegeneration progresses rapidly in the CK-p25 mice, control (n = 7) and bitransgenic mice (n = 7) were trained 3 days after doxycycline withdrawal in order to assess the learning behavior after acute p25 induction. Notably, the escape latency of CK-p25 mice was significantly enhanced on training day 5 when compared to control mice (p = 0.0364, t1,12 = 3,182; Figure 2A). Furthermore, when the platform was removed during the probe test performed after 6 days of training, CK-p25 mice spent significantly more time swimming in the target quadrant (p = 0.0249; F3,24 = 8.692, target quadrant versus other quadrants; Figures 2B and 2F). At this time point, control mice did not show a significant preference for the target quadrant. In the second probe test, performed after 10 days of training, both control and CK-p25 mice spent more time swimming in the target quadrant than in the other quadrants, showing that both groups eventually learned to locate the hidden platform (Figures 2C and 2F, probe test 2). When comparing the escape latency of CK-p25 and control mice throughout the 10 days of training by repeated measurements, CK-p25 mice performed significantly better than control mice (p = 0.015, F1,138 = 10.220). These data demonstrated that a transient phase of p25 production enhanced spatial learning and memory. To test the spatial learning of CK-p25 mice at the onset of neurodegeneration, 6-week induced bitransgenic and control mice (n = 7/group) were trained for 10 consecutive days. Whereas the escape latency of control mice significantly improved over the 10 days of training trials, no such improvement was observed for CK-p25 mice (p < 0.0001; F1, 138 = 15,746; Figure 2D). Moreover, in contrast to control mice (F3,24 = 10.723, p < 0.05, target quadrant versus other quadrants), CK-p25 mice showed no preference for the target quadrant during the probe test performed at the conclusion of the 10-day training (Figures 2E and 2F). The escape latency was not different among groups when the platform was visible (data not shown), further supporting the idea that the CK-p25 mice are not impaired in the sensory-motor processing. Together these findings suggest that spatial learning and memory are initially enhanced by transient p25 induction but are eventually impaired when p25 levels are chronically elevated. An important question is whether transient p25 expression, while initially beneficial, would eventually impair learning and lead to neurodegeneration. We induced p25 expression for 2 weeks and then separated mice into three different experimental groups. One group of CK-p25 mice was induced for an additional 4 weeks (6wON). The second group of mice was fed a doxycycline diet to repress p25 expression for an additional 4 weeks (2wON 4w OFF), and the last group was subjected to experimental procedures immediately after 2 weeks of p25 induction (2w ON). We subsequently analyzed p25 levels, neuronal loss, brain atrophy, and memory formation in all experimental groups (Figure 3A). Immunoblotting revealed that p25 levels were diminished in the 2wON 4wOFF mice (Figure 3B). In agreement, hippocampal Cdk5 activity in this group was indistinguishable from control mice (Figure 3B), and increased phosphorylation of Cdk5 substrates NR2A, PAK, and PSD-95 were reversed (see Figure S6). Moreover, staining for the neuronal marker NeuN (Figure 3C) and the glial marker GFAP (Figure 3D) demonstrated that in contrast to the 6wON mice, no obvious neuronal loss or astrogliosis was observed in the 2wON 4wOFF group. Consistently, while 6 weeks of p25 expression resulted in significant brain atrophy (p < 0.0001), the brain weights of the 2wON mice and the 2wON 4wOFF mice were indistinguishable from control mice (Figure 3E). We also examined CK-p25 mice that were induced for 6 weeks followed by 6 weeks of p25 repression. These mice displayed significantly reduced brain atrophy compared to those induced for 12 weeks (data not shown), suggesting that continuous p25 expression is required for maintaining the course of pathogenesis. Consistent with our earlier observation, when trained in the fear-conditioning paradigm, the 6wON mice (n = 7) showed significantly impaired memory consolidation (p = 0.0086, t1,13 = 3,183), whereas the 2wON mice (n = 7) displayed significantly enhanced freezing behavior in the context-dependent memory test (p = 0.0370, t1,13 = −2,304 versus control; Figure 3F). Remarkably, the ability to acquire context-dependent fear memories was still enhanced in the 2wON 4wOFF mice (n = 8; p = 0.0348, t1,14 = −3,104; Figure 3F). Similar to our previous findings, tone-dependent fear conditioning was impaired in the 6wON mice but was not affected in the other groups (Figure 3F). In addition, spatial learning using the water maze paradigm was facilitated in CK-p25 mice (n = 7/group) that were induced for 2 weeks followed by p25 repression. As memory consolidation in this paradigm does not occur in a well-defined time window, the training procedure was performed between 3–5 weeks of p25 repression. Over the 10 days of training trials, the escape latency of the 2wON 4wOFF mice improved significantly faster compared to control mice (p < 0.008, F1, 138 = 11.777; Figure 3G). Moreover, when the probe test was performed after seven training trials, the 2wON 4wOFF mice spent significantly more time in the target quadrant than control mice (t1,12 = −2.167, p < 0.0412; Figure 3G). Collectively, these data indicate that continuous p25 expression is required to induce astrogliosis, neuronal loss, and cognitive decline. Moreover, transient p25 expression is sufficient to enhance the ability to acquire new memories for a prolonged time period. To determine the cellular basis for the diametrically opposing effects of transient and prolonged p25 expression on hippocampus-dependent memories, we performed electrophysiological recordings with the use of hippocampal slices. First, we examined the effects of p25 expression on LTP. Field EPSPs (fEPSP) were evoked at the CA1 synapses by stimulating Schaffer collaterals at a low frequency (1 per min) to establish a stable baseline. In order to reveal both facilitating and inhibitory effects, a slightly weaker tetanic stimulation (50 Hz, 1 s) was used to induce LTP. A transient expression of p25 enhanced LTP. The CK-p25 mice induced for 7–9 days exhibited a significant increase in the magnitude of LTP when compared to control mice (Figure 4A). Synaptic potentiation measured 60 min after application of tetanus was 11.25% ± 8.59% above baseline (n = 6 slices) in control slices but 33.48% ± 4.59% (n = 8 slices) in the 2wON slices (Student's t test, p < 0.001). Remarkably, when compared to control littermates, LTP was still significantly enhanced in the 2wON 4wOFF mice (Figure 5A). A stronger tetanus (100 Hz, 1 s) was applied to the 6wON mice to reveal their inhibitory effect. Severe impairment in LTP was seen in these mice when compared to the control mice (Figure 4B). At 60 min after tetanus, the fEPSP slope was 33.57% ± 6.08% (n = 13 slices) above baseline in control but only 3.66% ± 8.47% (n = 10 slices) in 6wON slices (p < 0.001).Figure 5Enhanced Synaptic Plasticity in CK-p25 Mice that Were Induced for 2 Weeks followed by 4 Week p25 RepressionShow full caption(A) There was a significant increase in the magnitude of LTP in 2wON 4wOFF mice when compared to control mice.

A number of experiments were performed to determine the potential mechanisms underlying the increase and decrease in LTP observed in 2- and 6-week induced CK-p25 mice, respectively. First, we measured basal synaptic transmission by input-out curves, generated by plotting fEPSP slopes against the slopes of fiber volley. There was a small decrease in basal synaptic transmission in synapses of the 6wON animals, particularly when the presynaptic afferents were stimulated at higher intensities (Figure 4D). This is consistent with the finding that the total levels of AMPA receptors are reduced in these mice (data not shown). This small deficit, however, is less likely to account for the marked impairment in LTP. Second, we have examined several different forms of short-term plasticity. Synaptic response to a brief, high-frequency stimulation (HFS, 100 Hz, 20 pulses), which depletes all the readily releasable pool of transmitters or vesicles docked at presynaptic membrane, was measured. The rate of depletion of docked vesicles, as reflected by the ratio of the 20th and the 1st EPSP slopes, was the same in control and the 6wON mice (Figure S5B). Synaptic response to a prolonged, low-frequency stimulation (LFS, 12 Hz, 300 pulses) was also not changed, suggesting that the reserved pool of vesicles is normal in the 6wON mice (Figure S5D). Paired-pulse facilitation (PPF), which reflects the probability of presynaptic transmitter release, was slightly increased (Figure S5F). This again cannot explain the reduction in LTP. Finally, we measured NMDA receptor currents by employing whole-cell recordings in the presence of GABA (bicuculline, 10 μM) and AMPA receptor (CNQX, 20 μM) antagonists. The current-voltage relationships (I-V plots) of NMDA receptor currents for control of 6wON mice were indistinguishable (Figure 4F). Thus, the LTP deficit induced by prolonged p25 expression appears to be due to deficits downstream of NMDA receptor. Similar experiments were performed using 2wON mice. The input-output curves were similar between control and 2wON groups (Figure 4C), suggesting that basal synaptic transmission is normal. The HFS response and PPF were also normal (Figure S5A and S5E). Interestingly, synaptic response to LFS was consistently lower in slices derived from 2wON mice, compared to control (Figure S5C). Finally, we examined the effect of acute p25 expression on NMDA receptor. While the I-V curves were very similar at the negative holding potentials, NMDA currents were larger at positive holding potentials at the CA1 synapses of 2wON mice, compared to control (Figure 4E). While these data suggest that the NMDA receptors are more active in the 2wON synapses, how much this contributes to the increase in LTP remains to be investigated. It was previously reported that pharmacological inhibition of Cdk5 activity attenuates cocaine-mediated increased dendritic spine formation in striatal neurons (Norrholm et al., 2003Norrholm S.D. Bibb J.A. Nestler E.J. Ouimet C.C. Taylor J.R. Greengard P. Cocaine-induced proliferation of dendritic spines in nucleus accumbens is dependent on the activity of cyclin-dependent kinase-5.Neuroscience. 2003; 116: 19-22Crossref PubMed Scopus (191) Google Scholar). To explore whether aberrant activation of Cdk5 influences dendritic spine formation, we investigated the spine density of CA1 pyramidal neurons in CK-p25 mice by Golgi impregnation. The number of spines per dendrite was upregulated in 2-week induced CK-p25 mice when compared to control mice (Figure 6A; n = 3/group). In contrast to our behavioral and electrophysiological data showing impaired learning and decreased LTP, the CK-p25 mice induced for 6 weeks still exhibited a higher number of spines per dendrite. However, these mice displayed significant neuronal loss, as revealed by Hoechst dye staining (Figure 6A, n = 3/group), brain weight, and neuronal counts (Figures S1C and S1D). It should be noted that the majority of hippocampal CA1 pyramidal neurons in either 2wON or 6wON mice express high levels of p25 (Figure 6A, see also Figure 3C). To further verify whether the increased spine density in the CK-p25 mice was an immediate consequence of p25 expression, we transfected 13-day-old dissociated cultures of rat hippocampal neurons (13DIV) with EGFP or EGFP/p25. As reported previously (Patrick et al., 1999Patrick G.N. Zukerberg L. Nikolic M. de la Monte S. Dikkes P. Tsai L.H. Conversion of p35 to p25 deregulates Cdk5 activity and promotes neurodegeneration.Nature. 1999; 402: 615-622Crossref PubMed Scopus (1262) Google Scholar), neurotoxicity was evident 24–36 hr after p25 expression in dissociated neurons (data not shown). Cells were fixed 16–18 hr after transfection, and the number of dendritic spines was analyzed. A significantly higher spine/dendrite ratio was observed in p25/EGFP-transfected neurons compared to cells transfected with EGFP alone (Figure 6B). Transfection of p35 in primary hippocampal neurons did not lead to increased spine density, supporting the notion that p25 is a more potent Cdk5 activator"

Here we have shown that Atg7, an essential gene for autophagy, plays a pivotal role in the degradation of excess peroxisomes in mammals. Following induction of peroxisomes by a 2-week treatment with phthalate esters in control and Atg7-deficient livers, peroxisomal degradation was monitored within 1 week after discontinuation of phthalate esters. Although most of the excess peroxisomes in the control liver were selectively degraded within 1 week, this rapid removal was exclusively impaired in the mutant liver. Furthermore, morphological analysis revealed that surplus peroxisomes, but not mutant hepatocytes, were surrounded by autophagosomes in the control. Our results indicated that the autophagic machinery is essential for the selective clearance of excess peroxisomes in mammals.

Reorganization of organelles constitutively or suddenly occurs in eukaryotic cells as an adaptation to environmental changes accompanying the cell cycle, development, and differentiation (1.Lazarow P.B. Fujiki Y. Annu. Rev. Cell Biol. 1985; 1: 489-530Crossref PubMed Scopus (876) Google Scholar). Such alterations are stringently regulated by biogenesis and/or degradation. In the last decade, much attention was paid to the study of organelle assembly, an interest linked with the translocation of proteins into the organelles (2.Heiland I. Erdmann R. FEBS J. 2005; 272: 2362-2372Crossref PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar). One focus of that work was peroxisomes. Peroxisomes are single membrane-bound organelles that contribute to an array of metabolic pathways and are specifically and markedly induced by a group of nongenotoxic carcinogens and endogenous steroids in rodents (3.Reddy J.K. Azarnoff D.L. Hignite C.E. Nature. 1980; 283: 397-398Crossref PubMed Scopus (774) Google Scholar, 4.Reddy J.K. Lalwani N.D. CRC Crit. Rev.

Indeed, peroxisome proliferators increase the size, number, and enzymes involved in fatty acid metabolism: e.g. peroxisomal thiolase (PT), 3The abbreviations used are: PT, peroxisomal thiolase; BF, bifunctional protein; DEHP, diethylhexyl phthalate; MLP, mitochondrial/lysosomal/peroxisomal; Atg, autophagyrelated; BiP, binding protein; pIpC, polyinosinic acid-polycytidylic acid.3The abbreviations used are: PT, peroxisomal thiolase; BF, bifunctional protein; DEHP, diethylhexyl phthalate; MLP, mitochondrial/lysosomal/peroxisomal; Atg, autophagyrelated; BiP, binding protein; pIpC, polyinosinic acid-polycytidylic acid. peroxisomal bifunctional protein (BF), and fatty acid β-oxidation of peroxisomes (7.Yokota S.

However, the mechanistic basis of peroxisome turnover remains poorly understood (8.Subramani S. Physiol. Rev. 1998; 78: 171-188Crossref PubMed Scopus (281) Google Scholar, 9.Farre J.C. Subramani S.

In yeast species, such as Pichia pastoris, Hansenula polymorpha, Candida boidinii, and Saccharomyces cerevisiae, proliferating peroxisomes are degenerated by an autophagy-related process named pexophagy during glucose or ethanol adaptation (10.Kim J.

Yeast genetics of pexophagy revealed that most autophagy-related (Atg) genes play indispensable roles in this selective degradation of peroxisomes as well as autophagy (8.Subramani S. Physiol.

In mammals, however, whether or not the autophagic machinery is involved in the degradation of excess peroxisomes biosynthesized in response to drug cues remains a mystery. In particular, there is no direct evidence for the degradation of disused peroxisomes by the autophagic machinery, and it is not clear whether such a degradation process, if any, is selective or non-selective. It has also been reported that selective degradation of mitochondria may occur via autophagy-related mechanism in yeast (17.Kissova I. Deffieu M. Manon S. Camougrand N. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 39068-39074Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (341) Google Scholar, 18.Lemasters J.J. Rejuvenation Res. 2005; 8: 3-5Crossref PubMed Scopus (871) Google Scholar). Therefore, selectivity in the organelle turnover via autophagy is an important issue. Among the many Atg genes that regulate autophagy, Atg7, which encodes a ubiquitin-activating enzyme (E1)-like enzyme common to two ubiquitylation-like conjugations, the LC3 (Atg8 in yeast) and Atg12 conjugation systems, is a critical gene for autophagosome formation in yeast and mammalian cells (19.Tanida I.

Cell. 1999; 10: 1353-1366Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar). During mammalian autophagy, LC3-I (a cytosolic form of LC3) is lipidated to LC3-II (its autophagosomal membrane-bound form) by Atg7 (an E1-like enzyme) and Atg3 (a ubiquitin carrier protein (E2)-like enzyme) (21.Kabeya Y.

Recently, we have established conditional knock-out-mice of Atg7 and have shown that Atg7 is indispensable for mammalian autophagy and that the autophagy deficiency in liver leads to marked accumulation of cytoplasmic proteins (20.Komatsu M. Waguri S. Ueno T. Iwata J. Murata S. Tanida I. Ezaki J. Mizushima N. Ohsumi Y. Uchiyama Y. Kominami E. Tanaka K. Chiba T. J. Cell Biol. 2005; 169: 425-434Crossref PubMed Scopus (1857) Google Scholar). In the normal liver, LC3 is continuously synthesized to form LC3-I, and LC3-I is subsequently conjugated with phosphatidylethanolamine to form LC3-II during autophagy. LC3-II is then recruited to autophagosomal membranes (21.Kabeya Y. Mizushima N. Ueno T. Yamamoto A. Kirisako T. Noda T. Kominami E. Ohsumi Y. Yoshimori T. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 5720-5728Crossref PubMed Scopus (5306) Google Scholar, 28.Asanuma K. Tanida I. Shirato I. Ueno T. Takahara H. Nishitani T. Kominami E. Tomino Y. FASEB J. 2003; 17: 1165-1167Crossref PubMed Scopus (178) Google Scholar), and the autophagosomal LC3-II is rapidly degraded after fusion of autophagosome with lysosome (29.Tanida I. Minematsu-Ikeguchi N. Ueno T. Kominami E. Autophagy. 2005; 1: 84-91Crossref PubMed Scopus (913) Google Scholar). This dynamic flow of LC3 is completely inhibited in Atg7-deficient liver and, as a consequence, more LC3-I accumulates in the mutant liver (20.Komatsu M. Waguri S. Ueno T. Iwata J. Murata S. Tanida I. Ezaki J. Mizushima N. Ohsumi Y. Uchiyama Y. Kominami E. Tanaka K. Chiba T. J. Cell Biol. 2005; 169: 425-434Crossref PubMed Scopus (1857) Google Scholar). Considering that deletion of yeast Atg7/Gsa7 gene results in a defect of pexophagy in P. pastoris (24.Yuan W. Stromhaug P.E. Dunn Jr., W.A. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1999; 10: 1353-1366Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar), the liver-specific Atg7-conditional knock-out mice will be an advantageous tool in investigating the degradation of peroxisomes in mammals. In this study, we analyzed the clearance of surplus peroxisomes using the conditional-knock-out mice of Atg7 (20.Komatsu M. Waguri S. Ueno T. Iwata J. Murata S. Tanida I. Ezaki J. Mizushima N. Ohsumi Y. Uchiyama Y. Kominami E. Tanaka K. Chiba T. J. Cell Biol. 2005; 169: 425-434Crossref PubMed Scopus (1857) Google Scholar). The results indicated that autophagy is essential for the degradation of accumulated peroxisomes in the mouse liver. Reagents—Phthalate esters (diethylhexyl phthalate (DEHP)), corn oil, and leupeptin were purchased from Sigma. Animals and Treatment Regimen—C57B6J mice were used as wild-type mice. Male mice received DEHP (1,150 mg/kg/day) or vehicle (corn oil, 5 ml/kg/day) via sonde daily for 2 weeks, and the mice were subsequently fed on a normal diet for 1 week to investigate the changes in proliferated peroxisomes during the recovery process according to the protocol reported previously (7.Yokota S. Eur. J. Cell Biol. 1993; 61: 67-80PubMed Google Scholar). For detection of autophagosomes by electron microscopy, mice were injected with leupeptin (2 mg/100 g of body weight) after administration of DEHP. All animals were sacrificed by deep anesthesia. Deletion of Atg7 in Mouse Liver—Atg7 conditional knock-out mice and the heterozygotes were prepared as described previously (20.Komatsu M. Waguri S. Ueno T. Iwata J. Murata S. Tanida I. Ezaki J. Mizushima N. Ohsumi Y. Uchiyama Y. Kominami E. Tanaka K. Chiba T. J. Cell Biol. 2005; 169: 425-434Crossref PubMed Scopus (1857) Google Scholar). Briefly, creatine expression in the liver was induced by intraperitoneal injection of polyinosinic acid-polycytidylic acid (pIpC). pIpC was injected three times at a 48-h interval. Preparation of the Fractions—Livers from Atg7F/+:Mx1 and Atg7F/F:Mx1 mice were treated with DEHP or corn oil for 2 weeks, and at 1 week after treatment, they were dissected. Subfractionation of the livers was accomplished by differential centrifugation according to the method of de Duve et al. (30.de Duve C. Pressman B.C. Gianetto R. Wattiaux R. Appelmans F. Biochem. J. 1955; 60: 604-617Crossref PubMed Scopus (2544) Google Scholar). Briefly, 20% homogenates were prepared in 0.25 m sucrose, 10 mm HEPES-NaOH, pH 7.4 (homogenizing buffer). The homogenate of the liver was centrifuged at 650 × g for 5 min to remove nuclei and unbroken cells. The pellets were resuspended in the same volume of homogenizing buffer and were then recentrifuged. The supernatants from these two centrifugations were combined and used as postnuclear supernatant fractions. Postnuclear supernatant fractions were centrifuged at 10,000 × g for 20 min, and pellets were used as the mitochondrial/lysosomal/peroxisomal (MLP) fractions. The post-MLP supernatants were further centrifuged at 105,000 × g for 60 min to precipitate microsomal fractions in pellet form. All procedures were performed at 4 °C. Immunoblot Analysis—Immunoblotting was performed as described previously (19.Tanida I. Mizushima N. Kiyooka M. Ohsumi M. Ueno T. Ohsumi Y. Kominami E. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1999; 10: 1367-1379Crossref PubMed Scopus (322) Google Scholar). The antibody against Mn2+-superoxide dismutase was kindly provided by Prof. Naoyuki Taniguchi (Osaka University, Japan).

Cell Biol. 1990; 110: 651-660Crossref PubMed Scopus (186) Google Scholar), and the β-subunit of ATP synthase (33.Ezaki J. Wolfe L.S. Higuti T. Ishidoh K. Kominami E. J. Neurochem. 1995; 64: 733-741Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar) were prepared as described previously. The antibodies against tubulin and BiP were purchased from Chemicon International, Inc. (Temecula, CA) and Affinity BioReagents, Inc. (Golden, CO), respectively. Histological Examination—Livers were dissected, fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde, frozen, embedded, and sectioned. For immunohistochemical analysis, the sections were blocked with 5% normal goat serum in phosphate-buffered saline containing 0.2% Triton X-100 and then incubated with anti-PT antibody and Alexa Fluor 488-labeled second antibody (Molecular Probes, Eugene, OR). Fluorescence images were obtained using a fluorescence microscope (Q550FV; Leica, Germany) equipped with cooled charge-coupled device camera (CTR MIC; Leica). Pictures were taken using Leica Qfluoro software (Leica). Electron Microscopy—Livers were perfusion-fixed with the fixative through the portal vein for 10 min. The fixative consisted of 2% paraformaldehyde, 1% glutaraldehyde, and 0.1 m HEPES-KOH buffer (pH 7.4). To visualize peroxisomes, some liver slices were incubated in alkaline 3,3-diaminobendine medium consisting of 2 mg/ml 3,3-diaminobendine, 0.02% hydrogen peroxide, and 0.2 m glycine-NaOH buffer (pH 10.0) for 1 h at room temperature. Then they were postfixed with 1% reduced osmium tetroxide for 1 h. The other tissue slices were postfixed in 1% reduced osmium tetroxide with 3,3-diaminobendine reaction. All tissue slices were then dehydrated in graded series of ethanol and embedded in Epon. Thin sections were cut with a diamond knife using an ultramicrotome (Reichert, Vienna, Austria). Sections were contrasted with 40 mm lead citrate for 5 min and examined with a Hitachi H7500 electron microscope (Hitachi, Tokyo, Japan). Quantitative Analysis of Peroxisomes—For each tissue slice, 20 digital electron micrographs were acquired at ×5,000 magnification, enlarged 2.7-fold, and printed by a laser printer. Using the printed figure, we measured the area of peroxisomes and that of the cytoplasmic area of hepatocytes using a SigmaScan scientific measurement system equipped with a computer (Jandel Scientific, San Rafael, CA). The relative total area of peroxisomes was calculated using the following formula: (number of peroxisomes in the average area of peroxisomes/cytoplasmic area) and expressed in μm2/100 μm2 of cytoplasmic area. Statistical Analysis—The statistical significance of differences between experimental and control groups was determined by the two-tailed Student's t test. A p value of <0.05 was considered statistically significant. Selective Degradation of Excess Peroxisomes—Phthalate ester (DEHP) and its active metabolite mono-ethylhexyl phthalate can cause marked increases in both the size and the number of peroxisomes and induce peroxisomal enzymes in the liver (7.Yokota S. Eur. J. Cell Biol. 1993; 61: 67-80PubMed Google Scholar). Utilizing these phenomena, we first investigated the specific proliferation of peroxisomes and the rapid recovery after removal of the drugs in mice. Wild-type mice were treated with DEHP for 2 weeks and then chased for 1 week as described under “Experimental Procedures.” The mice were dissected at each period, and the liver cell lysates were fractionated into MLP, microsomal, and cytosolic fractions. DEHP administration for 2 weeks was associated with about 2-fold increase in the amount of total protein in MLP, but not in microsomal or cytosolic fractions, as compared with untreated mice, and the amount almost returned to the basal level at 1 week after discontinuation of DEHP (Fig. 1A). These changes were not observed in mice treated with the vehicle (data not shown). Quantitative densitometric analysis of immunoblotting data revealed that PT and BF, marker proteins of peroxisomes, increased significantly after administration of DEHP but not the vehicle, and both diminished significantly to basal levels at 1 week after DEHP discontinuation (Fig. 1, B and C). In comparison, the levels of mitochondrial proteins, the β-subunit of ATP synthase and manganese superoxide dismutase, and the endoplasmic reticulum marker, BiP, remained unchanged during the same manipulations (Fig. 1B). Immunofluorescence analysis using anti-PT antibody revealed that a 2-week administration of DEHP, but not the vehicle, resulted in the appearance of numerous dots representing peroxisomes, and most of these dots disappeared at 1 week after discontinuation of DEHP (Fig. 1D). Considered together, these results indicate that DEHP-induced peroxisomes are selectively degraded following removal of the peroxisome proliferator. Impairment of Degradation of Proliferated Peroxisomes in Autophagy-deficient Liver—Next, to examine the effects of autophagy deficiency on peroxisome degradation, we took advantage of the conditional knock-out mice, Atg7F/F:Mx1 (mutant mice), and their littermates, Atg7F/+:Mx1 mice (control mice), the systems of which were recently established by our group (20.Komatsu M. Waguri S. Ueno T. Iwata J. Murata S. Tanida I. Ezaki J. Mizushima N. Ohsumi Y. Uchiyama Y. Kominami E. Tanaka K. Chiba T. J. Cell Biol. 2005; 169: 425-434Crossref PubMed Scopus (1857) Google Scholar). Autophagy is impaired following pIpC injection in Atg7F/F:Mx1 mouse livers. Indeed, we verified that Atg7 protein deletion in Atg7F/F:Mx1 but not Atg7F/+:Mx1 livers was pIpC injection-dependent (Fig. 2A). Furthermore, we also tested the loss of Atg7 activity by investigating the lack of LC3-II (a membrane-bound form of LC3) and accumulation of LC3-I (a cytosolic form of LC3) in the liver. It is generally accepted that LC3-II is a marker protein of autophagosomal membranes (21.Kabeya Y. Mizushima N. Ueno T. Yamamoto A. Kirisako T. Noda T. Kominami E. Ohsumi Y. Yoshimori T. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 5720-5728Crossref PubMed Scopus (5306) Google Scholar). Although both forms were detected in the control liver, only LC3-I accumulated in the mutant liver (Fig. 2A), indicating impairment of autophagy in mutant Atg7F/F:Mx1 mouse liver (20.Komatsu M. Waguri S. Ueno T. Iwata J. Murata S. Tanida I. Ezaki J. Mizushima N. Ohsumi Y. Uchiyama Y. Kominami E. Tanaka K. Chiba T. J. Cell Biol. 2005; 169: 425-434Crossref PubMed Scopus (1857) Google Scholar). In the control livers, although LC3-II were induced by the proliferated peroxisomes (Fig. 2A, indicated by 2 w DEHP), it was decreased almost to the basal levels at 1 week after withdrawal of DEHP (Fig. 2A), suggesting that autophagy was induced to remove surplus peroxisomes. After a 2-week treatment with DEHP, the livers were dissected, and total proteins in the lysates of mutant and control livers were separated by SDS-PAGE and subjected to immunoblot analyses. Similar to the results obtained with wild-type mice (Fig. 1), BF and PT increased profoundly after the treatment as compared with mice prior to DEHP administration and then decreased almost to the basal levels at 1 week after discontinuation in Atg7F/+:Mx1 livers (Fig. 2, A and B). Although this increase was also detected in mutant Atg7F/F:Mx1 livers, the increased PT and BT proteins did not return to the basal levels following the discontinuation of DEHP (Fig. 2, A and B). In contrast to peroxisomal proteins, the levels of mitochondrial (β-subunit of ATP synthase and Mn2+-superoxide dismutase) and endoplasmic reticulum (BiP) markers did not change under these conditions (Fig. 2, A and B). These results indicate selective impairment of degradation of excess peroxisomal proteins in autophagy-deficient Atg7F/F:Mx1 liver. We further confirmed the impairment of peroxisome degradation in autophagy-deficient liver by immunofluorescence analysis using anti-PT antibody (Fig. 3). The PT-positive dots representing peroxisomes were markedly increased following a 2-week DEHP treatment in both genotype livers, as compared with untreated mice (Fig. 3, A and D versus B and E). Although the dots almost disappeared to the basal levels at 7 days after discontinuation of DEHP in the control (Fig. 3C), most of the peroxisome dots remained visible in mutant liver after the same intervention (Fig. 3F). The data are in agreement with the biochemical results shown in Fig. 2. Based on these results, we concluded that autophagy is essential for selective degradation of excess peroxisomes. Engulfment of Excess Peroxisomes by Autophagosomal Membranes in Control Hepatocytes—Finally, we used electron microscopy to explore the level of the peroxisomes in Atg7F/F:Mx1 and Atg7F/+:Mx1 livers (Fig. 4). Consistent with the results of immunofluorescent analysis, numerous peroxisomes were detected following a 2-week DEHP treatment in both wild and mutant hepatocytes (Fig. 4, B and E), and most of these structures disappeared after 1 week of discontinuation of DEHP in the control, but not mutant, hepatocytes (Fig. 4, C and F). The relative total area of peroxisomes was determined, and the mean values are shown in Fig. 4G. Although the relative total area of peroxisomes increased in both groups after a 2-week DEHP administration, the area decreased to the basal level in control hepatocytes, but not in mutant hepatocytes, at 1 week after DEHP withdrawal from the diet (Fig. 2G). After discontinuation of DEHP, we detected only a few autophagosome-like structures in control hepatocytes, probably due to the rapid turnover of autophagosomes by lysosome (Fig. 4C). Considering the selective degradation of peroxisomal marker proteins, PT and BF (Fig. 2), autophagosomes that selectively enwrap peroxisomes could be observed by electron microscopic analysis when lysosomal proteolysis is inhibited. Therefore, we examined whether proliferated peroxisomes enclosed by autophagosomal membranes can be detected under the condition of inhibited autophagic proteolysis. Injection of leupeptin, a lysosomal cysteine proteinase inhibitor, into a 2-week DEHP-treated control Atg7F/+:Mx1 mouse resulted in marked accumulation of autophagosomes, and some peroxisomes were surrounded by a double-membrane structure, autophagosome, in control hepatocytes (Fig. 5). No autophagosome was identified in hepatocytes of Atg7F/F:Mx1 mice (data not shown). These lines of evidence indicated that the autophagic machinery mediated is essential for selective clearance of excess peroxisomes, as it is so for starvation-induced autophagy in the mouse liver. Most cellular components, if not all, are regulated quantitatively to maintain cell homeostasis. For this regulation, there are growing lines of evidence for the importance of the balance between biosynthesis and degradation. Peroxisomes, a typical cellular component, are dynamic organelles induced and degraded in response to extracellular cues (8.Subramani S. Physiol. Rev. 1998; 78: 171-188Crossref PubMed Scopus (281) Google Scholar). However, little is known about the mechanism for peroxisome degradation in mammals. There are two major concepts for degradation of peroxisomes, i.e. autophagic machinery and autolysis (34.Yokota S. Oda T. Fahimi H.D. J. Histochem. Cytochem. 2001; 49: 613-621Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar, 35.Yokota S. Microsc. Res. Tech. 2003; 61: 151-160Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). By the analysis of autophagy-deficient livers, we showed the first direct evidence that peroxisomal breakdown is mainly, if not entirely, dependent on autophagic machinery. Based on quantitative densitometry with two peroxisomemarker enzymes (Fig. 2, PT and BF) as well as morphometry of the electron micrographs (Fig. 4), ∼70–80% of peroxisomes induced by DEHP were degraded via autophagy during 1 week after discontinuation of the drug administration. Considering peroxisome degradation by autophagic machinery in mammals, it is important to know whether the process occurs via micropexophagy or macropexophagy. In methylotrophic yeast species, it is well established that the autophagy-related process, termed pexophagy, induces a rapid and selective degradation of excess peroxisomes (13.Bellu A.R. Kiel J.A. Microsc. Res. Tech. 2003; 61: 161-170Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). In P. pastoris cells, following a shift from methanol to ethanol or glucose, unnecessary peroxisomes are degraded by macropexophagy and micropexophagy, respectively (9.Farre J.C. Subramani S. Trends Cell Biol. 2004; 14: 515-523Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar). Macropexophagy is the degradation pathway in which autophagosomes selectively surround excess peroxisomes. On the other hand, in micropexophagy, the excess peroxisomes are not degraded through autophagosome formation. The initial step in micropexophagy is invagination and septation of a vacuole followed by engulfment of the peroxisomes by the vacuole. In the final stage, the edges of the vacuole fuse with each other followed by vacuolar degradation of the peroxisomal membrane and its contents. Because ATG7 is essential for both macropexophagy and micropexophagy in P. pastoris cells, it is plausible that excess peroxisomes in mammalian cells are also degraded by both macroautophagy and micropexophagy. Our data using electron microscopy revealed that autophagosomes preferentially surrounded excess peroxisomes in control hepatocytes (Fig. 5), suggesting that DEHP-induced peroxisomes are degraded mainly through the process of macropexophagy. Thus, we could show the selective role of autophagic machinery in the clearance of surplus peroxisomes after induction of peroxisomes by phthalate esters. Recent studies provided evidence for the involvement of the autophagic machinery in selective sequestration of proteins in the cell. For example, the precursor form of aminopeptidase I (prApe1) is a selective cargo molecule of autophagy in yeast (36.Shintani T. Klionsky D.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 29889-29894Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (286) Google Scholar), and cytosolic acetaldehyde dehydrogenase (Ald6p) is preferentially transported to vacuoles via autophagosomes in yeast (37.Onodera J. Ohsumi Y. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 16071-16076Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar). Consistently, the autophagic machinery could also selectively eliminate pathogenic group A Streptococci invading the cells (38.Nakagawa I. Amano A. Mizushima N. Yamamoto A. Yamaguchi H. Kamimoto T. Nara A. Funao J. Nakata M. Tsuda K. Hamada S. Yoshimori T. Science. 2004; 306: 1037-1040Crossref PubMed Scopus (916) Google Scholar). These reports strongly suggest that autophagosomes sequester the cytosolic protein(s) and invading pathogens in a highly selective manner. We recently reported that Atg7-deficient hepatocytes exhibit impaired constitutive autophagy responsible for selective degradation of ubiquitinated proteins (20.Komatsu M. Waguri S. Ueno T. Iwata J. Murata S. Tanida I. Ezaki J. Mizushima N. Ohsumi Y. Uchiyama Y. Kominami E. Tanaka K. Chiba T. J. Cell Biol. 2005; 169: 425-434Crossref PubMed Scopus (1857) Google Scholar). Our previous findings together with the present results suggest that the autophagic process eliminates abnormal and/or excess proteins and organelles including peroxisomes in a selective manner even under normal conditions. How the autophagy machinery recognizes these organelles to degrade them awaits further investigation. We thank Tsuguka Kouno for technical assistance."
https://openalex.org/W2059067548,"Activity-induced modification of GABAergic transmission contributes to the plasticity of neural circuits. In the present work we found that prolonged postsynaptic spiking of hippocampal neurons led to a shift in the reversal potential of GABA-induced Cl- currents (E(Cl)) toward positive levels in a duration- and frequency-dependent manner. This effect was abolished by blocking cytosolic Ca2+ elevation and mimicked by releasing Ca2+ from internal stores. Activity- and Ca2+-induced E(Cl) shifts were larger in mature neurons, which express the K-Cl cotransporter KCC2 at high levels, and inhibition of KCC2 occluded the shifts. Overexpression of KCC2 in young cultured neurons, which express lower levels of KCC2 and have a more positive E(Cl), resulted in hyperpolarized E(Cl) similar to that of mature cells. Importantly, these young KCC2-expressing neurons became responsive to neuronal spiking and Ca2+ elevation by showing positive E(Cl) shifts. Thus, repetitive postsynaptic spiking reduces the inhibitory action of GABA through a Ca2+-dependent downregulation of KCC2 function."
https://openalex.org/W2171247575,"Recent studies emphasize the overlap between the neural substrates of visual perception and visual imagery. However, the subjective experiences of imagining and seeing are clearly different. Here we demonstrate that deactivation of auditory cortex (and to some extent of somatosensory and subcortical visual structures) as measured by BOLD functional magnetic resonance imaging unequivocally differentiates visual imagery from visual perception. During visual imagery, auditory cortex deactivation negatively correlates with activation in visual cortex and with the score in the subjective vividness of visual imagery questionnaire (VVIQ). Perception of the world requires the merging of multisensory information so that, during seeing, information from other sensory systems modifies visual cortical activity and shapes experience. We suggest that pure visual imagery corresponds to the isolated activation of visual cortical areas with concurrent deactivation of ""irrelevant"" sensory processing that could disrupt the image created by our ""mind's eye."""

Calcium ionophores, cytokines, growth factors, and chemotactic peptides also induce shedding (22Hooper N.M. Karran E.H. Turner A.J. Biochem. J. 1997; 321: 265-279Crossref PubMed Scopus (558) Google Scholar). The majority of the shedding events are mediated by the zinc-dependent metalloproteinases of the metzincin family, which includes MMPs and proteases containing a disintegrin and metalloproteinase (ADAM) domain. Tissue inhibitors of metalloproteinases (TIMPs) regulate the activity of MMPs and some ADAMs. There are four distinct TIMPs. TIMP-1–4 inhibit a wide range of MMPs, whereas TIMP-3 is also an inhibitor of ADAM-17. ADAM-10 is inhibited by TIMP-1 and -3, whereas ADAM-8 and -9 are very poorly inhibited by, and are unlikely to be physiologically regulated by, TIMPs. To date, no ADAM has been shown to be inhibited by TIMP-2. ADAMs are type I transmembrane glycoproteins; and in addition to their proteolytic activity, they also mediate cell adhesion. Tumor necrosis factor-α (TNFα)-converting enzyme (TACE) plays a central role in ectodomain shedding (16Schlondorff J. Blobel C.P. J. Cell Sci. 1999; 112: 3603-3617Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Cell lines derived from TACE-deficient mice (TACE–/–) verify that TACE is involved in the PMA-induced shedding of a number of structurally and functionally diverse proteins, including pro-TNFα, l-selectin, β-amyloid precursor protein, transforming growth factor-α, heparin-binding epidermal growth factor (EGF), and vascular cell adhesion molecule-1 (VCAM-1) (14Peschon J.J.

Cells were plated on 24-well tissue culture plates (50,000 cells/well) and grown to 70–80% confluence. Human umbilical vein endothelial cells (ECs) purchased from Clonetics (San Diego) were grown in DMEM/Ham's F-12 supplemented with 20% FCS and EGM™-2 (27Pluskota E. Chen Y. D'Souza S.E. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 30029-30036Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). ECs from passages 2–6 were used for this study. ECs (removed by brief trypsin treatment) were coated on 12-well plates at a density of 25,000 cells/well and grown to confluence. TACE–/– and TACE+/+ fibroblasts (EC2 and EC4 cell lines) (14Peschon J.J. Slack J.L. Reddy P. Stocking K.L. Sunnaborg S.W. Lee D.C. Russell W.E. Castner B.J. Johnson R.S. Fitzner J.N. Boyce R.W.

Black (Immunex Corp., Seattle, WA). Mouse EC2 and EC4 fibroblasts were cultured in DMEM, 10% FCS, 1 mm l-glutamine, and penicillin/streptomycin at 37 °C, 5% CO2, and 100% humidity. Monocytic THP-1 cells (American Type Culture Collection) were cultured in DMEM with 5% FCS.Transfection—Human wild-type TIMP-3 cDNA was a gift from Dr. D. R. Edwards (University of East Anglia, Norwich, UK). Human mutant TIMP-3(C1S) cDNA (a gift from Dr. M. Bond, Bristol Heart Institute, Bristol, UK) (29Bond M. Murphy G. Bennett M.R. Amour A. Knauper V. Newby A.C. Baker A.H. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 41358-41363Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar) was subcloned into pEGFP-N1 (Clontech), replacing the enhanced green fluorescent protein cDNA (30Yeow K.M. Kishnani N.S. Hutton M. Hawkes S.P. Murphy G. Edwards D.R. Matrix Biol. 2002; 21: 75-88Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). Mouse TACE cDNA in pMOS was a gift from Celltech Chiroscience (Bothell, WA) (28Gardiner E.E. D'Souza S.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 15474-15480Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). The TACE cDNA was subcloned into pcDNA3.1/Zeo(+) (Invitrogen), and a FLAG peptide was inserted immediately preceding the proposed proprotein convertase cleavage site using standard PCR technology and sequenced. To transiently express human wild-type TIMP-3, human mutant TIMP-3(C1S), or mouse TACE in 293ICAM-1 cells, cells were grown to 60–80% confluence on 12-well plates and transfected with 0.5–2.0 μg of the appropriate DNA using Lipofectamine Plus™ (Invitrogen). Briefly, for each well in transfection, DNA was diluted in 25 μl of DMEM without serum and containing 5 μl of Lipofectamine Plus reagent. This mixture was incubated for 15 min at room temperature. 2 μl of Lipofectamine reagent was mixed into 25 μl of DMEM without serum. The diluted DNA and Lipofectamine reagent were mixed and incubated for 15 min at room temperature to allow DNA-liposome complexes to form. While complexes were being formed, the medium on the cells was replaced with 0.4 ml of DMEM without serum. For each transfection, 50 μl of the DNA/liposome mixture was overlaid and mixed gently. The plate was incubated at 37 °C in a CO2 incubator. After 5 h of incubation, the medium was replaced with medium containing serum and incubated further. Cell lysates were assayed for transient gene expression 48 h after transfection.Small Interfering RNA (siRNA) Transfection—TACE siRNA was purchased from Dharmacon (Lafayette, CO). Transfection of siRNA was performed using GenePORTER transfection reagent (Gene Therapy Systems, Inc., San Diego). Briefly, 293ICAM-1 cells/ECs were grown to 60–80% confluence on 24-well plates. 5 μl of the transfection reagent was diluted in 0.125 ml of DMEM. 2 μg of siRNA was also separately diluted in 0.125 ml of DMEM. They were mixed together and incubated at room temperature for 45 min. The mixture was overlaid on the cells and incubated at 37 °C in a CO2 incubator. After 2–5 h, the overlaid siRNA/reagent mixture was diluted by adding 0.25 ml of complete medium containing 5% FCS and further incubated for 24–48 h. The transfected 293 cells were stimulated with PMA (3 μm) for 3 h. The transfected ECs were stimulated with TNFα (10 ng/ml) for 16 h. Both the non-stimulated and stimulated lysates were collected and stored at 4 °C for analysis.Transfection of Immortalized Mouse EC2 and EC4 Fibroblasts with Human ICAM-1 cDNA and Analysis of ICAM Shedding—EC2 and EC4 fibroblasts were seeded onto 6-well dishes in DMEM and transfected for 16 h with pcDNA3.1 alone or with human ICAM-1 cDNA using FuGENE 6 (Roche Diagnostics) according to the manufacturer's instructions. The medium was then replaced with 1 ml of prewarmed fresh medium prior to incubation with or without BB-94 for 30 min at a final concentration of 10 μm. Cells were incubated with or without 3 μm PMA for 6 h. The medium was then harvested and subjected to centrifugation in a microcentrifuge for 5 min at 16,000 × g before analysis by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. EC2 and EC4 cell lines were found to transfect at different efficiencies. To derive a correction factor, separate wells of each cell line were transfected with 0.5 μg of pEGFP-N1 in duplicate, and the enhanced green fluorescent protein fluorescence of the cells was quantitated using a Tecan Spectrafluor Plus plate reader with the appropriate filters.Analysis of ICAM-1 Shedding and Inhibitor Assays—Treatment of 293ICAM-1 cells was conducted under serum deprivation conditions. The medium was replaced with DMEM containing 1% FCS 1 h before the experiment. Media substitution caused little cell death, as cells remained firmly attached to the plate surface. Inhibitors were added at the indicated concentrations and incubated for 3 h at 37 °C. After stimulation with PMA (3 μm), cells were incubated for an additional 3 h at 37 °C. ECs were supplemented with fresh medium containing 10% FCS 1 h before the experiment. Cells were stimulated with TNFα and incubated for 6 h, after which time inhibitors were added as indicated, and cells were incubated for an additional 18 h at 37 °C. After treatment, cell morphology and degree of adhesion were assessed, and cell viability was estimated using the trypan blue exclusion assay. Drug concentrations were maintained in a range that did not affect cell viability. After treatment, cells were rinsed with DMEM and then lysed with ice-cold lysis buffer (10 mm Tris (pH 7.5), 5 mm EDTA, 50 mm NaCl, 0.5% Triton X-100, 0.1% SDS, and 1% Nonidet P-40). Protein concentration was measured using the BCA kit. Aliquots containing equal amounts of total protein were analyzed by 16.5% Tricine/SDS-PAGE (32Schagger H. von Jagow G. Anal. Biochem. 1987; 166: 368-379Crossref PubMed Scopus (10442) Google Scholar). Proteins were transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride membranes and immunoblotted with a primary antibody, followed by a horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibody. Blots were developed using the ECL detection system. The intensity of the signals on the autoradiograms was quantitated using UN-SCAN-IT software. The signal intensity in the absence of inhibitors was taken as 100%, and the degree of inhibition was expressed accordingly as a percentage. Each data point represents the results of at least three separate experiments (means ± S.E.).Adhesion Assay—Adhesion of THP-1 cells to ECs was performed as described previously (7Tsakadze N.L. Sen U. Zhao Z. Sithu S.D. English W.L. D'Souza S.E. Am. J. Physiol. 2004; 287: C55-C63Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). Briefly, ECs grown on 24-well culture plates were stimulated with TNFα and treated with inhibitors. Monocytic THP-1 cells were gently added to the EC monolayer and incubated for 1 h at 37 °C. Nonadherent cells were removed. Adherent cells were stained with 0.25% rose bengal. The excess stain was removed, and cells were washed. The stain was extracted with ethanol/Dulbecco's phosphate-buffered saline, and the absorbance was measured at a wavelength of 570 nm. The absorbance of the non-stimulated ECs in the absence of THP-1 cells was taken as the background and subtracted from the other values. Each data point represents the results of three separate experiments. Statistical analysis was performed with Student's t test. Differences were considered significant when p ≤ 0.05.Cleavage Site Analysis—The cleavage site was assessed by molecular mass analysis using the Micromass instrumentation that utilizes electrospray ionization time-of-flight mass spectrometry. The ∼7-kDa fragment of ICAM-1 was eluted out of gel, desalted, and subjected to electrospray ionization mass spectrometry. Several point mutations in the “stalk” region of wild-type ICAM-1 on pcDNA3.1 (7Tsakadze N.L. Sen U. Zhao Z. Sithu S.D. English W.L. D'Souza S.E. Am. J. Physiol. 2004; 287: C55-C63Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar, 27Pluskota E. Chen Y. D'Souza S.E. J. Biol.

R433A, R433K, R431A, E438A, R451A, N446A, R441A/K442A, were generated using the QuikChange™ site-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA). 293 cells were transiently transfected with each of the above mutations, and PMA-induced cleavage was examined and compared with that of wild-type ICAM-1 as described above.RESULTSMMPs Regulate ICAM-1 Shedding—Cleavage was monitored utilizing an antibody directed against the cytoplasmic sequence of ICAM-1, which recognizes both full-length ICAM-1 (∼93 kDa) and a cytoplasmic fragment (∼7 kDa) remaining after ectodomain cleavage. In 293ICAM-1 cells, there is a certain level of constitutive shedding, which is increased by 2–3-fold upon stimulation with PMA (7Tsakadze N.L. Sen U. Zhao Z. Sithu S.D. English W.L. D'Souza S.E. Am. J. Physiol. 2004; 287: C55-C63Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). The detection of the membrane-bound 7-kDa fragment in cell lysates corresponds to the appearance of sICAM-1 in the culture medium (7Tsakadze N.L. Sen U. Zhao Z. Sithu S.D. English W.L. D'Souza S.E. Am. J. Physiol. 2004; 287: C55-C63Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). Protease inhibitors of different classes were utilized to identify enzyme(s) responsible for the shedding of ICAM-1.EDTA and EGTA—Metal chelators of divalent cations dose-dependently inhibited the cleavage of ICAM-1 in PMA-stimulated 293 cells and in TNFα-stimulated ECs, indicating that a metal-dependent or metal-containing protease(s) is involved in the release of ICAM-1. EDTA and EGTA at 5 mm inhibited cleavage by >80% in 293ICAM-1 and by >90% in ECs (Table 1). We observed no significant effect with soybean trypsin inhibitor and phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, thus indicating that serine proteases are unlikely to be involved in ICAM-1 shedding. However, three different inhibitors of MMPs were effective in blocking cleavage. Phosphoramidon, the least effective of the three reagents, displayed inhibitory activity at higher concentrations and at 80 μm caused 72% inhibition in 293ICAM-1 cells, whereas the degree of inhibition was ∼55% in ECs (Table 1). Phosphoramidon is not a potent inhibitor of the metzincin class of metalloproteinases, and its ineffectiveness is to be expected if an ADAM or a membrane-type MMP is involved in ICAM-1 shedding. TAPI-1, known to inhibit conventional MMPs and ADAMs, at 75 μm caused >90% inhibition in 293ICAM-1 cells. TAPI-1 was very effective even at 10 μm. In ECs, the degree of inhibition was 65% at 75 μm. MMPI-III (effective against MMP-1, -2, -3, -7, and -13) at 100 μm blocked cleavage by >80% in both cell types (Table 1). As the S2′ position is not known to contribute significantly to an inhibitor's interaction with TACE, MMPI-III can be considered similar in properties to Ro-31-9790. MMPI-III has the same specificity for MMP-1, -2, and -3 as Ro-31-9790, and it is likely that its IC50 for TACE will be approximately similar, i.e. 30–50 μm (Calbiochem) (31Amour A. Silicombe P.M. Webster A. Butler M. Knight C.G. Smith B.J. Stephens P.E. Shelley C. Hutton M. Knauper V. Docherty A.J. Murphy G. FEBS Lett. 1998; 435: 39-44Crossref PubMed Scopus (542) Google Scholar), in agreement with its potency in inhibiting ICAM-1 shedding. These inhibitors had very similar effects on the constitutive shedding of ICAM-1 (data not shown).TABLE 1Effect of metalloprotease and serine protease inhibitors on ICAM-1 shedding in ECs and 293ICAM-1 cellsInhibitorsInhibitionECs293ICAM-1 cells%EDTA (5 mm)9577EGTA (5 mm)9584Phosphoramidon (80 μm)5572TAPI-1 (75 μm)6595MMPI-III (100 μm)8288SBTIaSBTI, soybean trypsin inhibitor.

Open table in a new tab The mercuric compound APMA is known to activate in vitro MMPs as well as ADAMs (20Merloz-Suarez A. Ruiz-Paz S. Baselga J. Arribas J. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 48510-48517Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar). As shown in Fig. 1A, APMA up-regulated the cleavage of ICAM-1 by >2-fold with the corresponding production of sICAM-1 in the culture medium in a dose- and time-dependent manner. Interestingly, the cytoplasmic fragment generated upon stimulation with APMA migrated at the same ∼7-kDa level as the one induced by PMA stimulation. sICAM-1 detected in the culture medium after APMA and PMA treatment was also indistinguishable (data not shown). Therefore, a protease(s) induced by these two compounds causes cleavage at a common site or at sites in close proximity. When APMA and PMA were applied simultaneously, no further increase in the amount of ICAM-1 shedding was observed (data not shown). These results indicate that ICAM-1 shedding is mediated by a member of the MMP-like family of proteases.The differing prote"

Using patch clamp recordings, we investigated whether P2X7Rs have the same action in hippocampal astrocytes in situ. We found that 2- and 3-O-(4-benzoylbenzoyl)ATP (BzATP), a potent, although unselective P2X7R agonist, triggers two different glutamate-mediated responses in CA1 pyramidal neurons; they are transient inward currents, which have the kinetic and pharmacological properties of previously described slow inward currents (SICs) due to Ca2+-dependent glutamate release from astrocytes, and a sustained tonic current. Although SICs were unaffected by P2X7Rs antagonists, the tonic current was inhibited, was amplified in low extracellular Ca2+, and was insensitive to glutamate transporter and hemichannel inhibitors. BzATP triggered in astrocytes a large depolarization that was inhibited by P2X7R antagonists and amplified in low Ca2+. In low Ca2+ BzATP also induced lucifer yellow uptake into a subpopulation of astrocytes and CA3 neurons. Our results demonstrate that purinergic receptors other than the P2X7R mediate glutamate release that evokes SICs, whereas activation of a receptor that has features similar to the P2X7R, mediates a sustained glutamate efflux that generates a tonic current in CA1 neurons. This sustained glutamate efflux, which is potentiated under non-physiological conditions, may have important pathological actions in the brain.

Glutamate is the principal mediator of excitatory neurotransmission in the central nervous system as well as a recognized excitotoxic agent that can lead neurons and astrocytes to death when present at excessive extracellular concentrations (1.Choi D.W. Neuron. 1988; 1: 623-634Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (4203) Google Scholar, 2.Choi E.S.H. Clegg D.O. Dev. Biol. 1990; 142: 169-177Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). The ability to release this transmitter (3.Parpura V. Basarsky T.A. Liu F. Jeftinija K. Jeftinija S. Haydon P.G. Nature. 1994; 369: 744-747Crossref PubMed Scopus (1418) Google Scholar, 4.Pasti L.

Nature. 1998; 391: 281-285Crossref PubMed Scopus (1002) Google Scholar) hints at direct participation of astrocytes in glutamatergic neuronal transmission as well as in the excitotoxic action of glutamate. Although this latter issue remains to be proved, increasing evidence indicates that astrocyte-derived glutamate has complex actions on neurons exerting a modulatory role on synaptic transmission. For example, in the retina the release of glutamate from astrocytes modulates ganglion cell spike activity driven by light stimulation, most likely through a presynaptic action (6.Newman E.A. Zahs K.R. J. Neurosci. 1998; 18: 4022-4028Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In the hippocampus, it modulates excitability of interneurons and potentiates inhibitory transmission (7.Kang J. Jiang L.

McCarthy K.D. J. Neurosci. 2004; 24: 722-732Crossref PubMed Scopus (283) Google Scholar). At the same time, astrocytic glutamate exerts a direct action on hippocampal pyramidal neurons by activating extra-synaptic NMDARs 2The abbreviations used are: NMDAR, N-methyl-d-aspartate (NMDA) receptor; P2X7R, purinergic P2X7 receptor; [Ca2+]i, intracellular Ca2+ concentration; BzATP, 2- and 3-O-(4-benzoylbenzoyl)ATP; SIC, slow inward current; TTX, tetrodotoxin; LY, lucifer yellow; d-AP5, d-(-)-2-amino-5-phosphonopentanoic acid; NBQX, 2,3-dioxo-6-nitro-1,2,3,4-tetrahydrobenzo[f]quinoxaline-7-sulfonamide; TBOA, DL-threo-β-benzyloxyaspartate; α,β-mATP, α,β-methylene ATP; BBG, Brilliant Blue G; OxATP, adenosine 5-triphosphate-2,3-dialdehyde; AMPA, α-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methyl-4-isoxazolepropionic acid.2The abbreviations used are: NMDAR, N-methyl-d-aspartate (NMDA) receptor; P2X7R, purinergic P2X7 receptor; [Ca2+]i, intracellular Ca2+ concentration; BzATP, 2- and 3-O-(4-benzoylbenzoyl)ATP; SIC, slow inward current; TTX, tetrodotoxin; LY, lucifer yellow; d-AP5, d-(-)-2-amino-5-phosphonopentanoic acid; NBQX, 2,3-dioxo-6-nitro-1,2,3,4-tetrahydrobenzo[f]quinoxaline-7-sulfonamide; TBOA, DL-threo-β-benzyloxyaspartate; α,β-mATP, α,β-methylene ATP; BBG, Brilliant Blue G; OxATP, adenosine 5-triphosphate-2,3-dialdehyde; AMPA, α-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methyl-4-isoxazolepropionic acid. and triggering episodic, inward currents characterized by slow kinetics (SICs) (10.Angulo M.C.

Neuron. 2004; 43: 729-743Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (745) Google Scholar). Interestingly, this NMDAR response can occur synchronously in multiple CA1 neurons, raising the possibility that it may serve to promote synchrony of neuronal activity (10.Angulo M.C. Kozlov A.S.

As to the mechanism of glutamate release, it is known that [Ca2+]i elevations in astrocytes can rapidly trigger the fusion with the plasma membrane of glutamate-containing vesicles (12.Kreft M. Stenovec M. Rupnik M. Grilc S. Krz̆an M. Potokar M. Pangršic T. Haydon P.G. Zorec R. Glia. 2004; 46: 437-445Crossref PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar, 13.Bezzi P. Gundersen V. Galbete J.L. Seifert G. Steinhäuser C. Pilati E. Volterra A. Nat. Neurosci. 2004; 7: 613-620Crossref PubMed Scopus (583) Google Scholar). Although this exocytosis-mediated pathway is most likely involved in astrocyte-to-neuron signaling under physiological conditions, other mechanisms may contribute to this process under both physiological and pathological conditions (14.Evanko D.S. Zhang Q. Zorec R. Haydon P.G. Glia. 2004; 47: 233-240Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar, 15.Fellin T. Carmignoto G. J. Physiol. (Lond.). 2004; 559: 3-15Crossref Scopus (219) Google Scholar). Recently, a glutamate release mechanism that involves the P2X7R has been proposed (16.Duan S. Anderson C.M. Keung E.C. Chen Y. Swanson R.A. J. Neurosci. 2003; 23: 1320-1328Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). This receptor has an established role in cellular toxicity and inflammatory processes (17.Di Virgilio F. Immunol. Today. 1995; 16: 524-528Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (352) Google Scholar, 18.Di Virgilio F. Chiozzi P. Ferrari D. Falzoni S. Sanz J.M. Morelli A. Torboli M. Bolognesi G. Baricordi O.R. Blood. 2001; 97: 587-600Crossref PubMed Scopus (623) Google Scholar). Upon sustained activation with ATP, it can form a pore permeable to molecules of relatively large size (<900 Da), thus allowing molecules, such as glutamate, to efflux from, or enter into the cytoplasm according to their concentration gradient. In support of the role of the P2X7R, the release of glutamate from murine-cultured astrocytes triggered by purinergic receptor agonists has been described (16.Duan S. Anderson C.M. Keung E.C. Chen Y. Swanson R.A. J. Neurosci. 2003; 23: 1320-1328Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) to be (i) larger upon stimulation with BzATP than with ATP (the latter being a weak P2X7R agonist), (ii) greatly potentiated in divalent ion-free medium, i.e. a condition that favors P2X7R openings, and (iii) blocked by P2X7R antagonists. Although these results from cultured astrocytes clearly indicate that under selected experimental conditions the P2X7R allows the efflux of glutamate into the extracellular space, no such evidence exists for astrocytes in situ. On the other hand, at physiological concentrations of extracellular Ca2+, ATP is known to trigger a significant release of glutamate from astrocytes (19.Jeremic A. Jeftinija K. Stevanovic J. Glavaski A. Jeftinija S. J. Neurochem. 2001; 77: 664-675Crossref PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar, 20.Coco S. Calegari F. Pravettoni E. Pozzi D. Taverna E. Rosa P. Matteoli M. Verderio C. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 1354-1362Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (423) Google Scholar), which in this case depends on a classic Ca2+-dependent pathway. Indeed, by activating both ionotropic, Ca2+-permeable P2XRs, including the P2X7R and/or metabotropic P2YRs, ATP can evoke an intracellular Ca2+ increase that in turn mediates glutamate release. The aim of this study was to gain insights into the role of the purinergic receptor P2X7 in the generation of glutamate release from in situ astrocytes. Results obtained in patch clamp recordings from neurons and astrocytes of acute hippocampal slices allow us to conclude that P2X7R activation is not involved in the episodic glutamate release that triggers SICs. In contrast, a P2X7-like receptor, possibly expressed in astrocytes and neurons, contributes significantly to increasing the extracellular concentration of glutamate, in particular when extracellular Ca2+ decreases to very low levels. Slice Preparation—Transverse hippocampal slices (350–400 μm) were prepared as previously described (4.Pasti L. Volterra A. Pozzan T. Carmignoto G. J. Neurosci. 1997; 17: 7817-7830Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 21.Edwards F.A. Konnerth A. Sakmann B. Takahashi T. Pfluegers Arch. Eur. J.

Slice cutting and incubation was performed with the following physiological saline solution: 120 mm NaCl, 3.2 mm KCl, 1 mm KH2PO4, 26 mm NaHCO3, 2 mm MgCl2, 1 mm CaCl2, 2.8 mm glucose, 2 mm sodium pyruvate, and 0.6 mm ascorbic acid at pH 7.4 with 95% O2,5%CO2. Slice incubation with 300 μm OxATP for 2–3 h and with 2–4 μm BBG for either 30 min or 1 h was carried out at 37 °C. When incubated with BBG for 30 min, slices were preincubated for 30 min in saline at 37 °C. As appropriate controls in OxATP and BBG experiments, we used slices maintained at 37 °C for either 1 or 2–3 h, respectively, and the recordings from these slices was performed the same days of the recordings from BBG- or OxATP-incubated slices. Recordings were also performed from additional neurons from control slices on days different from the days in which BBG and OxATP experiments were performed. Because the mean values of SIC frequency and tonic current amplitude from the different control experiments were similar, data from these experiments were pooled together. Patch Clamp Recordings and Data Analysis—Most of the experimental procedures are similar to that described previously (11.Fellin T. Pascual O. Gobbo S. Pozzan T. Haydon P.G. Carmignoto G. Neuron. 2004; 43: 729-743Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (745) Google Scholar). In brief, during recordings slices were perfused with the following saline solution: 120 mm NaCl, 3.2 mm KCl, 1 mm KH2PO4, 26 mm NaHCO3, 2 mm CaCl2, 2.8 mm glucose, and 1 μm glycine at pH 7.4 with 95% O2,5%CO2. Low Ca2+ solution was obtained by replacing CaCl2 with EGTA (0.25 mm). Intracellular pipette solution was 145 mm potassium gluconate, 2 mm MgCl2, 5 mm EGTA, 2 mm Na2ATP, 0.2 mm NaGTP, and 10 mm HEPES to pH 7.2 with KOH. Slices were viewed with an upright Zeiss Axioscope microscope (Carl Zeiss Spa, Milan, IT) equipped with differential interference Nomarski optics, a CCD camera (COHU Inc., San Diego, CA), and a mercury light source for fluorescence excitation. Data were amplified and filtered at 1 KHz with one or two Axopatch-200B amplifiers and sampled at 5 KHz with a Digidata 1200 interface (Axon instruments, Union City, CA). The liquid junction potential at the pipette tip was -15 mV. This value should be added to all voltages to obtain the correct value of the membrane potential in whole-cell configuration. Series resistance (6 < RS < 15 megaohms) was monitored throughout each experiment, and no compensation of RS was applied. All experiments were performed at either room temperature or 35 °C and in the presence of TTX. Astrocytes were identified on the basis of both morphological and electrophysiological criteria. Astrocytes typically have small and round cell soma (diameter 6–10 μm), lack optically apparent large processes, do not fire action potentials upon application of depolarizing current pulses, and have a low input resistance (mean: 15.5 ± 1.9 megaohms, n = 24) and highly negative resting potentials (mean, -77.3 ± 0.7 mV, n = 24). All the astrocytes considered in this study exhibited a linear I-V relationship, typical of passive astrocytes (22.Matthias K. Kirchhoff F. Seifert G. Hüttmann K. Matyash M. Kettenmann H. Steinhäuser C. J. Neurosci. 2003; 23: 1750-1758Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Neurons were voltage-clamped at -60 mV and astrocytes at -75 mV. Clampfit 8.2 (Axon instrument) and Origin 6.0 (Microcal Software, Northampton, MA) software were used for data analysis and fitting. Transient inward currents with rise time slower than 10 ms and amplitude greater than -20 pA were classified as SICs. SIC frequency, amplitude, and kinetics were measured as described previously (11.Fellin T. Pascual O. Gobbo S. Pozzan T. Haydon P.G. Carmignoto G. Neuron. 2004; 43: 729-743Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (745) Google Scholar). In pair recording experiments, the time interval between two SICs was measured as the time interval between the onset of the current in cell 1 and the onset of the current in cell 2. Background noise amplitude was calculated as the peak-to-peak amplitude. Student's t test was performed to determine statistical significance. Data are expressed as mean ± S.E. Ca2+ Imaging and Dye Uptake—Slice incubation with 10 μm Rhod-2 AM (Molecular Probes, Eugene, OR) and 0.02% pluronic for 50 min at 37 °C under mild stirring resulted in the selective loading of the Ca2+ indicator into astrocytes (23.Mulligan S.J. MacVicar B.A. Nature. 2004; 431: 195-199Crossref PubMed Scopus (698) Google Scholar). A confocal laser scanning microscope (TCS SP2 RS, Leica, Mannheim, Germany) was used for monitoring the BzATP-induced [Ca2+]i change in these cells. Slices were continuously perfused at room temperature with the same extracellular solution as used in electrophysiological recording with 0.2 mm sulfinpyrazone. The sampling rate was 2–4 s, and 8 images were averaged for each frame. Rhod-2 fluorescence was excited at 543 nm, and emitted light above 550 nm was collected. The fluorescent signal at a given time point was expressed as ΔF/F = (F1 - F0)/F0, where F0 and F1 are the values of the fluorescence in astrocytes at rest and at the given time point, respectively. No background subtraction was applied. Dye uptake experiments were carried out incubating slices for 5–15 min with 1 μm TTX, 0.5 mg/ml lucifer yellow (LY) with or without 100 μm BzATP in the same solution used in patch clamp recording experiments under mild stirring and continuous bubbling with 95% O2, 5% CO2 to maintain pH 7.4. Incubation was terminated by washing in physiological saline, and fluorescence imaging was performed within 30 min. Fluorescence images were obtained with the same Leica confocal microscope using 458-nm excitation for LY. Cells were visually identified from the differential interference contrast image, and fluorescence intensity was measured from individual cells as the average intensity of fluorescence in a region of interest corresponding to the cell soma. No background subtraction was applied. In the 8-bit scale, a value of fluorescence intensity corresponding to 50 arbitrary units (3-fold the average background noise value: 17.7 ± 0.8 arbitrary units, n = 475) was chosen as the threshold for classifying positive cells. Background noise was not different in control slices and in slices incubated with BzATP or BzATP and low Ca2+. Because of possible damage caused by slice cutting procedures, cells located close to the surface may unspecifically take up the dye. Therefore, cells positively loaded with the dye were considered only when they were located below the first 10–15 μm from the surface. Drugs—D-AP5, NBQX, 2-methyl-6-(phenylethynyl)pyridine hydrochloride, LY367385 ((S)-(+)- α-amino-4-carboxy-2-methyl-benzene-acetic acid), TBOA, and TTX were purchased from Tocris Cookson (Buckhurst Hill, UK), and BzATP, α,β-mATP, BBG, OxATP, LY, and carbenoxolone were from Sigma. All chemicals were dissolved in water or Me2SO and then diluted in the recording physiological solution just before use. Purinergic Receptor Stimulation Evokes Transient and Sustained Activation of Neuronal NMDA Receptors—In hippocampal slices in the absence of extracellular Mg2+ and in the presence of 1 μm TTX, BzATP (100 μm), a potent although unselective agonist of P2X7R (24.North R.A. Surprenant A. Annu. Rev. Pharmacol. Toxicol. 2000; 40: 563-580Crossref PubMed Scopus (612) Google Scholar, 25.Lambrecht G. Naunyn-Schmiedebergs Arch. Pharmacol. 2000; 362: 340-350Crossref PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar), evokes a complex response in 20 of 39 (51%) CA1 pyramidal neurons consisting of episodic, transient inward currents and a slowly developing tonic current (Fig. 1, A and A1). Transient inward currents had a low frequency and could occur also spontaneously (Fig. 1B). The tonic current initiated 1–2 min after the onset of the BzATP application had a mean amplitude of -80 ± 23 pA and a mean time to peak of 98 ± 9 s, and it was always associated with a more than 2-fold increase in the background noise of the current trace (n = 13, Fig. 1C). Both transient currents and the tonic current were detected in 6 of the 20 (30%) responsive neurons (Fig. 1, A and A1), whereas either the tonic current or transient currents were observed in 7 (35%) and 7 (35%) of the responsive neurons, respectively (Fig. 1, D and E). Both the transient currents (Fig. 2A) and the tonic current associated with noise increase (Fig. 2, B and C) evoked by BzATP were reversibly blocked by the NMDAR antagonist D-AP5 (50–100 μm) and can, thus, be attributed to the activation of NMDARs. These results clearly indicate that slice perfusion with BzATP triggers the release of glutamate that evokes in CA1 pyramidal neurons both transient and sustained activation of the NMDARs. BzATP-induced noise increase is not due to an increase in the spontaneous synaptic release of glutamate since in the presence of D-AP5 and TTX, the frequency and amplitude of AMPA-mediated miniature currents under basal conditions and upon BzATP stimulation were not significantly changed (12 ± 9 versus 15 ± 13 events/min, n = 4; -7.7 ± 0.2 pA, n = 115, versus -8.1 ± 0.3 pA, n = 176; p > 0.2). Glutamate Release from Astrocytes Mediates the Transient Neuronal Response—Elevations in the [Ca2+]i evoked in hippocampal CA1 astrocytes by various stimuli, including purinergic receptor agonists, have been recently shown to trigger a pulsatile release of glutamate from these cells (11.Fellin T. Pascual O. Gobbo S. Pozzan T. Haydon P.G. Carmignoto G. Neuron. 2004; 43: 729-743Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (745) Google Scholar). Glutamate released from activated astrocytes acts primarily on extra-synaptic NMDARs of CA1 pyramidal neurons to trigger episodic inward currents with characteristic slow kinetics that we have called SICs (11.Fellin T. Pascual O. Gobbo S. Pozzan T. Haydon P.G. Carmignoto G. Neuron. 2004; 43: 729-743Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (745) Google Scholar). The transient, slow events evoked by BzATP in CA1 pyramidal neurons described above are mediated exclusively by NMDARs and are insensitive to 1 μm TTX. Therefore, they have the same pharmacological profile of SICs (11.Fellin T. Pascual O. Gobbo S. Pozzan T. Haydon P.G. Carmignoto G. Neuron. 2004; 43: 729-743Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (745) Google Scholar) as well as of the slow currents described by Angulo et al. (10.Angulo M.C. Kozlov A.S. Charpak S. Audinat E. J. Neurosci. 2004; 24: 6920-6927Crossref PubMed Scopus (412) Google Scholar). As shown in Fig. 3A, the mean rise time of BzATP-induced transient currents is 70.1 ± 7.9 ms (n = 54), one order of magnitude larger than that of excitatory postsynaptic currents evoked in the same neurons by Schaffer collateral stimulation (rise time, 6.7 ± 0.5 ms, n = 22). The mean decay time was 376.5 ± 24.4 ms (Fig. 3B; n = 54), which is slower than that of the excitatory postsynaptic currents from the same neurons (τ1 = 17.9 ± 6.7 ms, τ2 = 195.5 ± 14.7 ms, n = 22). The amplitude of these events can reach several hundred pA, with a mean of -115.9 ± 15.6 pA (Fig. 3C; n = 54). These features are also typical of SICs, providing further evidence for the classification of BzATP-evoked transient currents as SICs. An additional feature of SICs is that they occur with a high degree of synchrony in different pyramidal neurons (10.Angulo M.C. Kozlov A.S. Charpak S. Audinat E. J. Neurosci. 2004; 24: 6920-6927Crossref PubMed Scopus (412) Google Scholar, 11.Fellin T. Pascual O. Gobbo S. Pozzan T. Haydon P.G. Carmignoto G. Neuron. 2004; 43: 729-743Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (745) Google Scholar). We investigated this issue by using patch clamp pair recordings from two pyramidal neurons. In two of the four pairs that displayed the transient currents upon BzATP stimulation, synchronous events were observed (Fig. 3D). The inter-event time interval histogram (Fig. 3E) shows that, similar to SICs, 42% of these events (40 of 96) are synchronized in a time window of 200 ms. Taken together, these data suggest that the BzATP-induced transient currents have the same pharmacological and biophysical properties of SICs, i.e. the NMDAR-mediated, slow inward currents that are triggered in CA1 pyramidal neurons by glutamate released from activated astrocytes. SIC and Tonic Current Generation Is Dependent on the Activation of Different Purinergic Receptors—Given that BzATP is known to be a strong agonist of the P2X7R, we next investigated the possible involvement of this receptor in the generation of the BzATP-induced SICs and tonic current. To this aim, we used OxATP (300 μm) or BBG (2–4 μm), which efficiently block the P2X7R (24.North R.A. Surprenant A. Annu. Rev. Pharmacol. Toxicol. 2000; 40: 563-580Crossref PubMed Scopus (612) Google Scholar, 26.Jiang L.-H. Mackenzie A.B. North R.A. Surprenant A. Mol. Pharmacol. 2000; 58: 82-88Crossref PubMed Scopus (345) Google Scholar, 27.Murgia M. Hanau S. Pizzo P. Rippa M. Di Virgilio F. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 8199-8203Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), although they probably also affect other P2XRs. In the presence of OxATP or BBG, BzATP triggered SICs (Fig. 4A) in 7 of 18 (39%) and in 8 of 19 (42%) neurons, respectively. The percentage of responsive neurons, the frequency of the BzATP-induced SICs, and their amplitude and kinetics were not significantly different from controls (Fig. 4B; Table 1). Interestingly, under these conditions and in all the neurons tested, BzATP failed to trigger a tonic current (Fig. 4C) or an increase in background noise (Fig. 4D). These data demonstrate that, on the one hand, SICs generation is not mediated by P2X7 receptors and, on the other, that the generation of the tonic current is dependent upon the activation of a purinergic receptor type that is blocked by OxATP and BBG.TABLE 1Amplitude and kinetics of SICs are independent of P2X7R activation Mean ± S.E., and range for the amplitude and rise and decay time of SICs evoked by BzATP or α,β-mATP under the various experimental conditions are shown.AmplitudeRise timeDecay timenpAmsmsBzATP-115.9 ± 15.670.1 ± 7.9376.5 ± 24.454(-23.0 to -496.2)(10.2 to 334.6)(42.9 to 1412.5)BzATP + BBG-94.9 ± 9.8ap > 0.153.3 ± 8.0ap > 0.1347.5 ± 48.4bp > 0.547(-20.1 to -260.0)(11.0 to 298.6)(63.1 to 1546.4)BzATP + OxATP-98.5 ± 15.2ap > 0.162.4 ± 8.4bp > 0.5318.6 ± 50.3ap > 0.134(-23.0 to -342.9)(16.8 to 256.0)(74.9 to 1398.8)α,β-mATP-109.6 ± 31.1bp > 0.570.4 ± 11.9bp > 0.5449.3 ± 53.4ap > 0.119(-23.5 to -636.2)(13.8 to 184.2)(184.3 to 933.6)BzATP + 0 Ca2+-216.7 ± 57.8cp < 0.0586.1 ± 18.4ap > 0.1490.4 ± 108.8ap > 0.113(-21.0 to -695.2)(13.1 to 206.4)(61.9 to 1327.5)a p > 0.1b p > 0.5c p < 0.05 Open table in a new tab Support for this hypothesis derives from the observation that other stimuli used to trigger SICs, such as (S)-3,5-dihydroxyphenylglycine, prostaglandin E2, or photolysis of caged-Ca2+, did not evoke a tonic current associated with an increase in background noise (11.Fellin T. Pascual O. Gobbo S. Pozzan T. Haydon P.G. Carmignoto G. Neuron. 2004; 43: 729-743Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (745) Google Scholar). Interestingly, 100 μm α,β-mATP, a purinergic agonist different from BzATP (24.North R.A. Surprenant A. Annu. Rev. Pharmacol. Toxicol. 2000; 40: 563-580Crossref PubMed Scopus (612) Google Scholar, 25.Lambrecht G. Naunyn-Schmiedebergs Arch. Pharmacol. 2000; 362: 340-350Crossref PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar), also failed to trigger either a tonic current (Fig. 5, A and B; n = 13) or an increase in background noise (Fig. 5C). Conversely, α,β-mATP triggered SICs in 6 of 13 pyramidal neurons (46%) with frequency, amplitude, and kinetics similar to those of SICs evoked by BzATP (Fig. 5D; Table 1). We also investigated the hypothesis that the action of Bz-ATP on neurons is mediated by adenosine receptors that can be activated by Bz-adenosine, a product of Bz-ATP degradation by ectonucleotidase enzymes. Results obtained show that application of 100 μm adenosine always failed to trigger a tonic current in CA1 neurons (n = 13, data not shown). As previously reported (28.Gerber U. Greene R.W. Haas H.L. Stevens D.R. J. Physiol. (Lond.). 1989; 417: 567-578Crossref Scopus (140) Google Scholar), we rather observed an outward current of a mean amplitude of 41.9 ± 4.5 pA. To gain further insights into the possible involvement of the P2X7R in the generation of the tonic current, we applied BzATP in the presence of low extracellular Ca2+, a condition that results in a large increase in the P2X7R conductance (29.North R.A. Physiol. Rev. 2002; 82: 1013-1067Crossref PubMed Scopus (2470) Google Scholar). To reduce the concentration of Ca2+ in the extracellular space, we perfused slices with saline containing 0.25 mm EGTA and no added Ca2+. Noteworthy is that 20 min after the onset of slice perfusion with this saline, a depolarizing stimulus (60 mm K+) still elicited [Ca2+]i elevations in neurons (data not shown). Thus, we confirm previous observations (30.Burgo A. Carmignoto G. Pizzo P. Pozzan T. Fasolato C. J. Physiol. (Lond.). 2003; 549: 537-552Crossref Scopus (15) Google Scholar) that the reduction of extracellular Ca2+ in slices is a slow process, and after perfusion with a saline containing 0 mm Ca2+ and 0.25 mm EGTA, sufficient Ca2+ remains in the extracellular space to elicit [Ca2+]i elevations through voltage-gated Ca2+ channels. In 7 neurons in which BzATP triggered either a clear (Fig. 6A, top, n = 3) or a nearly undetectable tonic current (Fig. 6A1, top, n = 4) when a second BzATP challenge was performed in low extracellular Ca2+, the amplitude of the tonic current was drastically increased (Fig. 6, A and A1, bottom, and B, left). The increase in background noise, which is always associated with the tonic current, was similarly enhanced (Fig. 6B, right). In contrast, the kinetic features of SICs evoked by BzATP in low Ca2+ are unchanged with respect to SICs evoked by BzATP in normal Ca2+ (Table 1). Because of the fact that BzATP in low Ca2+ triggered a large increase in the background noise of the trace, SICs of small amplitude were lost in the noise, and thus, only SICs of larger amplitude could be analyzed. As such, the mean amplitude of SICs evoked by BzATP in low Ca2+ results are higher than the mean amplitude of SICs evoked by BzATP in normal Ca2+. Slice perfusion for 3–4 min with low Ca2+ in the ab"
https://openalex.org/W2056147691,"GABA excites immature neurons and inhibits adult ones, but whether this contributes to seizures in the developing brain is not known. We now report that in the developing, but not the adult, hippocampus, seizures beget seizures only if GABAergic synapses are functional. In the immature hippocampus, seizures generated with functional GABAergic synapses include fast oscillations that are required to transform a naive network to an epileptic one: blocking GABA receptors prevents the long-lasting sequels of seizures. In contrast, in adult neurons, full blockade of GABA(A) receptors generates epileptogenic high-frequency seizures. Therefore, purely glutamatergic seizures are not epileptogenic in the developing hippocampus. We suggest that the density of glutamatergic synapses is not sufficient for epileptogenesis in immature neurons; excitatory GABAergic synapses are required for that purpose. We suggest that the synergistic actions of GABA and NMDA receptors trigger the cascades involved in epileptogenesis in the developing hippocampus."

Notch1 also plays a role in the control of neurite extension in mammalian cells and in axon growth in Drosophila (8Sestan N. Artavanis-Tsakonas S. Rakic P.

Interestingly, in the immune system Notch1 serves two biologically contrasting functions; it is responsible for the apoptotic cell death of B lymphocytes (11Morimura T. Goitsuka R. Zhang Y. Saito I. Reth M. Kitamura D. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 36523-36531Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar), whereas it promotes the survival of T cells (12Sade H. Krishna S.

The diverse effects of Notch1 activation observed in multiple cell types and at different stages of development suggest the presence of context-dependent control mechanisms. Growth factors (GF) and ECM molecules (acting through integrins) belong to the complex environment that surrounds NSC during development (13Campos L.S. BioEssays. 2005; 27: 698-707Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar) and that affect Notch signaling. For example, FGF-1 and -2 inhibit neural differentiation by affecting (directly or indirectly) the Notch pathway (14Faux C.H. Turnley A.M. Epa R. Cappai R. Bartlett P.F. J. Neurosci. 2001; 21: 5587-5596Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), and EGFR activation leads to Notch signaling during pancreas tumorigenesis (15Miyamoto Y. Maitra A. Ghosh B. Zechner U. Argani P.

Integrins may also be involved in the Notch response during angiogenesis, when Notch4-expressing endothelial cells display β1-integrin in an active, high affinity conformation (16Leong K.G. Hu X.

Furthermore, in zebrafish the boundary cells between developing somites behave differently depending on the levels of Notch activation, and it has been suggested that the extracellular matrix (which differs at the rhombomere boundaries) plays a role in this process (17Blair S.S.

Nevertheless, the coordination between β1-integrin, Notch1, and GF pathways is poorly understood.Lipid rafts are special membrane regions that affect signaling by sorting proteins and lipids into specific membrane domains, where privileged interactions occur. Caveolae are specialized lipid rafts that contain cholesterol, sphingolipids, and caveolins (22-24-kDa membrane proteins, required for the formation of the caveolae) and that serve as scaffolds for signaling molecules.In this paper, we explore how some of the receptors for ECM and GF (that are present on the surface of the NSC) act together with the Notch1 pathway to control the NSC responses to changes in the microenvironment. We discuss the possibility that lipid rafts may play important roles in directing the changes in signaling and the responses to environmental changes that occur during cortical development and may act as integrators of parallel and simultaneous signals originated from integrins, growth factors, and Notch receptors. We conclude that the GF and ECM composition of biological neural stem cell “niches” may affect NSC maintenance and differentiation by affecting Notch signaling, in a context- and time-dependent manner.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESReagents and Antibodies—FGF-2 was obtained from PeProtech, EGF was from Calbiochem, and B27 supplement was from Invitrogen. Antibodies for immunoprecipitation-blocking experiments and Western blots were obtained from Chemicon and Pharmingen (anti-β1 integrins), Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc. (Santa Cruz, CA) (EGFR), Upstate Biotechnology, Inc. (Lake Placid, NY) (EGFR), and Cell Signaling Technology (phosphorylated MAPK and MAPK). Antibodies used for immunohistochemistry included polyclonal Notch1 and caveolin 1 (Santa Cruz Biotechnology), monoclonal anti-Nestin (Pharmingen), and monoclonal anti-β III tubulin (Sigma). All fluorescent secondary antibodies were obtained from Jackson Immunochemicals or Molecular Probes, Inc. (Eugene, OR). The EGF receptor inhibitor AG1478, (Calbiochem) was used at 20 μm. Mixtures of protease and phosphatase inhibitors were from Calbiochem. The remaining products were from Sigma if not otherwise specified.Primary Neurosphere Culture and Preparation of ES Cell-derived NSC—Primary cultures were prepared from newborn and embryonic day 14.5 C57BL/6 mice (postnatal day P0-P2), as previously described (18Jacques T.S. Relvas J.B. Nishimura S. Pytela R. Edwards G.M. Streuli C. ffrench-Constant C. Development. 1998; 125: 3167-3177Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Briefly, spheres of neural precursors were grown in EGF or FGF-2 (20 ng/ml) from dissociated postnatal day 0-2 mouse forebrain in Dulbecco’s modified Eagle’s medium/Ham’s F-12 supplemented with B27 (19Reynolds B.A. Weiss S. Science. 1992; 255: 1707-1710Crossref PubMed Scopus (4508) Google Scholar, 20Svendsen C.N. Fawcett J.W. Bentlage C. Dunnett S.B. Exp. Brain Res. 1995; 102: 407-414Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar). The culture medium was changed every 3 days.To prepare ES cell-derived NSC, we used a similar approach to the one developed by Bibel et al. (21Bibel M. Richter J. Schrenk K. Tucker K.L. Staiger V. Nat. Neurosci. 2004; 7: 1003-1009Crossref PubMed Scopus (367) Google Scholar). Briefly, we generated embryoid bodies that were exposed to retinoic acid (RA) for 4 days (as described by Bain et al. (22Bain G. Kitchens D. Yao M. Huettner J.E. Gottlieb D.I. Dev. Biol. 1995; 168: 342-357Crossref PubMed Scopus (996) Google Scholar)). Taking into account that a switch in growth factor requirements (from FGF-2 to EGF) occurs in vivo during midneurogenesis (23Lillien L. Raphael H. Development. 2000; 127: 4993-5005Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 24Martens D.J. Tropepe V. van Der Kooy D. J. Neurosci. 2000; 20: 1085-1095Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), we sequentially exposed the RA-primed embryoid bodies to FGF-2 first and to a mix of FGF-2 and EGF second, in order to simulate the changes in the GF microenvironment that occur during embryonic CNS development.Secondary Neurosphere Formation Assays—Intact primary neurospheres maintained 8-10 days in vitro were mechanically dissociated, and the same number of cells for each condition was plated at low density (5000 cells in 1.5 ml, <5 cells/μl) and grown for 10 days in 20 ng/ml EGF and FGF-2. The number of secondary neurospheres formed was counted, and statistically significant differences between groups were calculated using Student’s t tests.Secondary Neurosphere Formation Assays after Morpholino Treatment or EGFR Inhibition—Intact neurospheres (8-10 days in vitro) were exposed to β1 antisense morpholinos obtained from GeneTools, following the manufacturer’s protocols (available on the World Wide Web at www.gene-tools.com). Control groups were exposed to a missense morpholino with a random sequence. The spheres were then mechanically dissociated, and the same number of cells for each condition were plated at low density (3-4 cells/μl) and grown for 10 days in different growth factor concentrations (20 or 2 ng/ml concentration of either EGF or FGF-2), as described above. The number of secondary neurospheres formed was then counted, and statistically significant differences between groups were calculated using Student’s t tests. Secondary neurosphere formation assays were also done in the presence of an EGFR inhibitor (AG1478, 20 μm), and these experiments were analyzed as described above.Immunohistochemistry—Neurospheres, ES cell-derived NSC, and neonatal or embryonic brain tissue were fixed in 2-4% paraformaldehyde in phosphate-buffered saline. Tissue samples were cryoprotected in 25% sucrose and sectioned (14 μm) prior to immunohistochemistry, except for cell monolayers. The samples were blocked in phosphate-buffered saline (0.1% Triton X-100) containing normal blocking serum and incubated overnight with the appropriate antibodies at 4 °C, followed by incubation with the secondary antibodies and counterstaining with DAPI or sytox green. Pictures were acquired using a Zeiss Axioplan 2 fluorescence microscope and Smartcapture 2 software.GST-NICD Construct Preparation—Briefly, the Notch intracellular domain (NICD) fragment was subcloned from the plasmid pbabe-NICD (kind gift from G. Weinmaster) into the pGEX expression vector to prepare a GST-NICD fusion protein. The fusion protein was produced in Escherichia coli, linked to agarose beads (Amersham Biosciences), and purified using standard protocols. Pull-down assays were performed by incubating total lysates obtained from neurospheres with the GST-NICD or GST-alone beads, for 2 h at room temperature. The beads were then collected, washed, and boiled, and the resulting supernatant was analyzed by SDS-PAGE and immunoblotting as follows.Western Blots and Immunoprecipitations—For Western blotting, neurospheres or ES cell-derived NSC were lysed (10 mm Tris-HCl, 5 mm EDTA, 150 mm NaCl buffer, 1% Triton X-100) in the presence of protease and phosphatase inhibitors (5 μg/ml leupeptin, 2 μg/ml aprotinin, 2 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1 μg/ml pepstatin, 2 mm sodium fluoride, 2 mm sodium vanadate, all from Sigma) or the equivalent Calbiochem mixtures. The supernatant was clarified by centrifugation at 14,000 rpm for 20 min at 4 °C. Protein concentrations were determined with a Bio-Rad protein assay with bovine serum albumin as a standard, and equal amounts of protein were loaded in each well. Proteins were separated by SDS-PAGE and electroblotted onto nitrocellulose membranes (Hybond-C; Amersham Biosciences). Membranes were blocked in 10% nonfat dry milk in Tris-buffered saline for 1 h at room temperature. Blots were then incubated with the primary antibodies overnight at 4 °C in milk/Tris-buffered saline containing 0.1% Tween 20 (TBS-T), followed by a 2-h incubation with the appropriate secondary peroxidase-conjugated antibody (Amersham Biosciences). Blots were developed using ECL reagents (Amersham Biosciences), following the manufacturer’s instructions (Amersham Biosciences). For immunoprecipitations, the samples were lysed as previously described. To remove nonspecifically binding proteins, 150-200 μg of proteins were precleared by mixing with agarose beads (A/G plus; Santa Cruz) for 30 min at 4 °C. The samples were then incubated with the adequate antibody in the presence of fresh agarose A/G beads, either at 4 °C overnight or at room temperature for 2 h on a rotating platform. The beads were then washed and boiled for 10 min in Laemmli loading buffer. Equal amounts (as measured by protein assay) were loaded on 10% SDS-polyacrylamide gels and processed for immunoblotting as previously described.Raft Isolation—Isolation of rafts was performed using sucrose gradients, as previously described (25Baron W. Decker L. Colognato H. French-Constant C. Curr. Biol. 2003; 13: 151-155Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar). Briefly, neurospheres were placed on ice and suspended for 30 min in 0.2 ml of extraction buffer: 50 mm Tris-HCl, 150 mm NaCl, 5 mm EDTA, 1% Triton X-100, and a mixture of protease and phosphatase inhibitors (Calbiochem). Cell lysates were then adjusted to 40% OptiPrep and overlaid with solutions of 30 and 10% Optiprep in the extraction buffer. These gradients were centrifuged for 16 h at 35,000 rpm at 4 °C in an SW50.i rotor (Beckman Instruments). Fractions of equal volume, including the raft (floating fraction) and nonraft (bottom fraction) fractions, were collected and analyzed by SDS-PAGE (10%), followed by immunoblotting. Protein assays were performed on all fractions before immunoblotting to ensure equal loading.Reverse Transcription-PCR—RNA was extracted using the RNAeasy kit (Qiagen), and 0.1 μg of RNA from each sample was used to generate cDNA using the transcriptor first strand cDNA synthesis kit (Roche Applied Science). Reverse transcription-PCR was done using the published primers for Hes5 and glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase and following the conditions described by Zine et al. (26Zine A. Aubert A. Qiu J. Therianos S. Guillemot F. Kageyama R. de Ribaupierre F. J. Neurosci. 2001; 21: 4712-4720Crossref PubMed Google Scholar)RESULTSβ1-Integrins and Notch1 Co-localize in the Ventricular Zone, in Neurospheres, and in ES Cell-derived NSC—Stem cells from the skin and prostatic epithelia can be identified and isolated by their high β1-integrin expression levels (27Watt F.M.

Cell Sci. 2001; 114: 3865-3872Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In the developing brain, β1-integrin is expressed in the ventricular zone (VZ) (4Campos L.S. Leone D.P. Relvas J.B. Brakebusch C. Fässler R. Suter U ffrench-Constant C. Development. 2004; 131: 3433-3444Crossref PubMed Scopus (267) Google Scholar) (Fig. 1C) by NSC that are exposed to a changing ECM and, possibly, to variable growth factor levels (13Campos L.S. BioEssays. 2005; 27: 698-707Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar, 29Campos L.S. J. Neurosci. Res. 2004; 78: 761-769Crossref PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar). Likewise, Notch1 plays a role in NSC and is thought to direct radial glial cell (RGC) differentiation (30Gaiano N. Nye J.S. Fishell G. Neuron. 2000; 26: 395-404Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (605) Google Scholar, 31Gaiano N. Fishell G. Annu. Rev. Neurosci. 2002; 25: 471-490Crossref PubMed Scopus (494) Google Scholar). Not surprisingly, Notch1 is expressed in the same VZ region (32Zhong W. Jiang M.M. Weinmaster G. Jan L.Y. Jan Y.N. Development. 1997; 124: 1887-1897Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) (Fig. 1B), and, interestingly, it is co-expressed with the β1-integrins (Fig. 1D). Co-expression of Notch1 and β1-integrins is also detectable in neurospheres (Fig. 1, E-G) (4Campos L.S. Leone D.P. Relvas J.B. Brakebusch C. Fässler R. Suter U ffrench-Constant C. Development. 2004; 131: 3433-3444Crossref PubMed Scopus (267) Google Scholar, 29Campos L.S. J. Neurosci. Res. 2004; 78: 761-769Crossref PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar, 33Capela A. Temple S. Neuron. 2002; 35: 865-875Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (591) Google Scholar) and in NSC/radial glial cell cultures, derived from ES cells (Fig. 1, H-J). The observation that both proteins are simultaneously expressed in neural progenitors and that their expression overlaps raises the hypothesis that they may cooperate or act in a coordinated fashion. To further test the hypothesis that β1-integrins and Notch pathways interact in neural progenitors/NSC, we used primary neurospheres and ES cell-derived NSC, the later providing an NSC-enriched population positive for RGC markers (Fig. 1, K and L) (21Bibel M. Richter J. Schrenk K. Tucker K.L. Staiger V. Nat. Neurosci. 2004; 7: 1003-1009Crossref PubMed Scopus (367) Google Scholar) (currently accepted to be NSC (34Alvarez-Buylla A. Garcia-Verdugo J.M. Tramontin A.D. Nat. Rev. Neurosci. 2001; 2: 287-293Crossref PubMed Scopus (845) Google Scholar)). Notch1 is highly expressed in the ES cell-derived NSC cultures and co-localizes with the β1-integrin (Fig. 1, H-J). The ES cell-derived NSC cultures are therefore suitable to study, in vitro, the cooperation between β1-integrin, growth factors, and Notch pathways, all of which are known to be crucial for NSC and RGC maintenance and development (4Campos L.S.

A. 2002; 99: 13178-13183Crossref PubMed Scopus (222) Google Scholar).β1-Integrin and Growth Factor Receptors Are Required for Secondary Neurosphere Generation—To test the role of β1-integrin in NSC, we treated primary neurospheres with morpholino antisense oligonucleotides against β1-integrin to decrease the β1 subunit protein levels in EGF- or FGF-2-grown cells, prior to secondary neurosphere formation assays (see “Experimental Procedures”). The decrease in β1-integrin was confirmed by Western blot (Fig. 2E). Spheres treated with antisense or missense (control) morpholino oligonucleotides were dissociated and tested for their capacity to form new spheres (secondary neurosphere formation assay; see “Experimental Procedures”). These experiments show that a decrease in β1-integrin is associated with a moderate decrease in secondary neurosphere formation (Fig. 2, A-D). Interestingly, in EGF-grown (A and B) and FGF-2-grown (C and D) cells, the decrease in secondary neurosphere formation is more significant at low EGF levels (2 ng/ml; Fig. 2B) than at higher EGF levels (20 ng/ml; Fig. 2A), suggesting that in the presence of high EGF levels, the cells are less dependent on β1-integrin to maintain adequate levels of proliferation or survival. After morpholino treatment, the decrease in secondary neurosphere formation in FGF-2-grown cells (Fig. 2, C and D) is already apparent at high levels of FGF-2 (20 ng/ml; Fig. 2C) when compared with spheres grown with low levels of FGF-2 (2 ng/ml; Fig. 2D).FIGURE 2β1-integrins and EGFR are required for secondary neurosphere formation. A decrease in β1-integrin affects secondary neurosphere formation at low EGF and at high FGF-2 concentrations. Intact neurospheres were exposed to morpholino antisense to reduce β1-integrin expression and then dissociated and used in secondary neurosphere formation assays in the presence of 20 ng/ml EGF (A), 2 ng/ml EGF (B), 20 ng/ml FGF (C), and 2 ng/ml FGF (D). The experiments were carried out five times for each condition. A statistically significant decrease (p < 0.001) in the number of secondary neurospheres formed after antisense treatment was observed at 20 ng/ml EGF, 2 ng/ml EGF, and 20 ng/ml FGF-2. The strongest effect was seen for 20 ng/ml FGF-2 (C), followed in order by EGF 2 ng/ml (B) and EGF 20 ng/ml (A), suggesting that the morpholino-treated FGF-2-grown spheres are more dependent on β1-integrin than the EGF-grown ones. The decrease in β1-integrin was ascertained by Western blot (E). Samples grown in EGF or FGF-2 and either exposed to the morpholino (m) or to the missense (ms) were run in parallel after protein quantification. Note that the EGFR is markedly up-regulated at the nestin-rich edge of FGF-2-grown spheres, as detected by immunohistochemistry on sectioned neurospheres (F, nestin; G, EGFR) and confirmed with Western blot (H). The nuclei in F and G are labeled with DAPI (blue). To test the role of the EGFR activation in neural progenitor proliferation, intact mouse spheres (grown in a mix of EGF and FGF-2 for 8 days) were used for secondary neurosphere formation assays in the presence of FGF-2 and of an EGFR inhibitor (AG1478; 20 μm), as described under “Experimental Procedures” (J). Control cells were exposed to Me2SO alone. Exposure to the EGFR inhibitor induces a statistically significant reduction (p < 0.001, n = 3) in the number of secondary spheres formed, in the presence of FGF-2. Note that EGFR is highly expressed at the edge of neurospheres (G), in the region where nestin-positive progenitors are abundant (F). Exposure of neurospheres to growth factors affects NICD levels; the addition of EGF and FGF-2 to 24-h growth factor-starved neurospheres leads to an increase in detection of Notch intracellular domain (NICD) by Western blot (I). The experiment shown is representative of various replicates (n > 3). Note that as a result of EGF or FGF-2 addition (after growth factor starvation) MAPK is phosphorylated, whereas total levels of MAPK remain similar, indicating a strong and specific response to the growth factors. Equal amounts of proteins were loaded in each lane. WT, wild type.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)EGFR and β1-integrin interactions have been extensively demonstrated in three-dimensional breast culture systems (36Wang F. Weaver V.M. Petersen O.W. Larabell C.A. Dedhar S. Briand P. Lupu R. Bissell M.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 14821-14826Crossref PubMed Scopus (547) Google Scholar), and it is conceivable that the high levels of EGFR found on the nestin-positive FGF-2-grown spheres (Fig. 2, F-H) may be responsible for the more acute response to a decrease in β1-integrin observed in FGF-2-grown cells. To test this hypothesis, spheres grown in both EGF and FGF-2 were used in a secondary neurosphere formation assay in the presence of FGF-2 and an EGFR inhibitor, AG1478 (20 μm). The exposure to AG1478 resulted in a sharp decrease in the number of secondary neurospheres formed, indicating that even for FGF-2-grown spheres, the EGFR is the crucial pathway involved in proliferation (Fig. 2J), as indeed suggested by the high levels of EGFR found on the FGF-2-grown cells (Fig. 2, G and H). Consequently, in FGF-2-grown spheres with decreased levels of β1-integrin (EGFR-strongly positive/β1-depleted), a lack of exposure to EGF will be severely felt (despite the high levels of EGFR expression) and cannot be compensated by (lacking) integrin activation. In the EGF-grown spheres (EGFR-positive/β1-depleted), even low levels of EGFR will be enough to respond to the EGF in the medium. These results suggest that β1-integrin may be important for EGFR activation in neurospheres and point toward a potential cooperation between the two pathways, as already described for epithelial cells and fibroblasts (37Kuwada S.K. Li X. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2000; 11: 2485-2496Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar, 38Moro L. Venturino M. Bozzo C. Silengo L. Altruda F. Beguinot L. Tarone G. Defilippi P. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 6622-6632Crossref PubMed Scopus (503) Google Scholar). Furthermore, it was recently shown that a decrease in β1-integrin causes a reduction in neurosphere size during secondary neurosphere formation assays, due to reduced progenitor proliferation and increased cell death (39Leone D.R.J. Campos L. Hemmi S. Brakebusch C. Fässler R. ffrench-Constant C. Suter U. J. Cell Sci. 2005; 118: 2589-2599Crossref PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar). The loss of β1-integrin in neurospheres also reduces the number of nestin-positive cells in a growth factor-dependent manner, and this phenotype can be rescued by exposing the cells to high growth factor levels (39Leone D.R.J. Campos L. Hemmi S. Brakebusch C. Fässler R. ffrench-Constant C. Suter U. J. Cell Sci. 2005; 118: 2589-2599Crossref PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar). This result is consistent with our morpholino experiments, and both may be explained by the signaling confluence of EGFR and β1-integrins toward the MAPK pathway. In fact, in the absence of β1-integrins, the signaling through the MAPK pathway may become more dependent on the presence of EGF in the medium (4Campos L.S. Leone D.P. Relvas J.B. Brakebusch C. Fässler R. Suter U ffrench-Constant C. Development. 2004; 131: 3433-3444Crossref PubMed Scopus (267) Google Scholar). Interestingly, we have also observed that the addition of EGF and FGF-2 to starved neurospheres leads to an increase of the detectable levels of NICD expression by Western blot (Fig. 2I). Other authors have observed that growth factors, such as ciliary neurotrophic factor, increase NICD expression levels (40Chojnacki A. Shimazaki T. Gregg C. Weinmaster G. Weiss S. J. Neurosci. 2003; 23: 1730-1741Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) or affect Notch activation (15Miyamoto Y. Maitra A. Ghosh B. Zechner U. Argani P. Iacobuzzo-Donahue C.A. Sriuranpong V. Iso T.

We have shown that IP3R can be phosphorylated by Akt kinase in vitro and in vivo. Endogenous IP3Rs in Chinese hamster ovary T-cells were phosphorylated in response to Akt activation by insulin. LnCAP cells, a prostate cancer cell line with constitutively active Akt kinase, also showed a constitutive phosphorylation of endogenous type I IP3Rs. In all cases, the IP3R phosphorylation was diminished by the addition of LY294002, an inhibitor of phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase.

However, staurosporine-induced caspase-3 activation in DT40 TKO cells stably expressing the S2681A mutant was markedly enhanced when compared with wild-type or S2681E IP3Rs.

Two serine residues have been identified as potential sites of phosphorylation in the type I IP3R isoform (12Ferris C.D. Cameron A.M. Bredt D.S. Huganir R.L. Snyder S.H. Biochem. Biophys. Res.

However, the preferred sites of phosphorylation and functional effects on IP3R channel function may differ in different cell types and between alternatively spliced variants (6Komalavilas P.

The serine/threonine protein kinase Akt/protein kinase B is the cellular homologue of the viral oncogene v-Akt and is activated by various growth factors and cytokines. The membrane translocation and initial activation of the enzyme is dependent on the production of 3-phosphorylated inositol lipids catalyzed by PI 3-kinase. The activated Akt kinase then phosphorylates a number of key substrates involved in the stimulation of intermediary metabolism and promotion of cell survival, proliferation, and growth (reviewed in Refs. 16Whiteman E.L.

An examination of the sequence of all three IP3R isoforms indicates the presence of a consensus RXRXX(S/T) sequence for phosphorylation by Akt kinase (19Lawlor M.A. Alessi D.R. J. Cell Sci. 2001; 114: 2903-2910Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In the present study, we have shown for the first time that IP3Rs are substrates for activated Akt kinase in vivo and have investigated several possible functional consequences of this phosphorylation on Ca2+ signaling.

Cells and Culture Conditions—The Chinese hamster ovary T-cell line (CHO-T), which stably expresses the human insulin receptor, was a kind gift from Dr. Bryan Wolf (Childrens Hospital University of Pennsylvania, Philadelphia, PA). This cell line was cultured in F-12 (Ham's) medium (Invitrogen) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum, 100 units/ml penicillin, 100 μg/ml streptomycin (complete F-12), and incubated at 37 °C in a 5% CO2, 95% air-humidified incubator. The prostrate cancer cell line LnCap was obtained from the American Type Culture Collection (ATCC) (Manassas, VA) and was passaged in RPMI 1640 medium with 10% fetal bovine serum, 100 units/ml penicillin, and 100 μg/ml streptomycin. The DT40 cell line containing targeted deletions of IP3R isoforms was a kind gift of Dr. T. Kurosaki (Kansai Medical University, Moriguchi, Japan) and was cultured as described previously (13Wagner L.E. Li W.H. Yule D.I. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 45811-45817Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). COS-7 cells were purchased from the ATCC and were cultured as described previously (20Boehning D. Joseph S.K. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 21492-21499Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). DNA Constructs and Transfection—The neuronal SII(+)/SI(-) type I IP3R construct, encoding a Kozac sequence and subcloned into pcDNA 3.1, has been described previously (20Boehning D. Joseph S.K. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 21492-21499Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). Mutants S2681A and S2681E were made using the QuikChange site-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene). The forward primers were designed following the manufacturer's recommendations as follows: 5′-AGAGCCATGGCCCTGGTC-3′ for the S2681A mutant and ATGAGAGCCATGGAACTGGTCAGCAGT-3′ for the S2681E mutant. (codon change is shown in bold). The reverse primer was the complementary sequence of the forward primer. PCR cycling conditions were performed according to the manufacturer's instructions, and the products were confirmed by automated sequencing (Applied Biosystems Model 377; Nucleic Acid Facility, Thomas Jefferson University, Philadelphia, PA). The cDNA encoding the human isoform of SERCA-2b in pcDNA 3.1 was a gift from Dr. J. Lytton (University of Calgary, Alberta, Canada) and Dr. David H. MacLennan (University of Toronto, Ontario, Canada). The construct encoding the membrane-targeted, constitutively active, human Akt kinase harboring a myristoylation sequence was kindly given by Dr. J. Q. Cheng (University of South Florida School of Medicine). A soluble version of a constitutively active bovine Akt kinase mutant (S473D/T308D) was kindly given by Drs. Stephanie Dimmeler and Judith Haendeler (University of Frankfurt, Frankfurt, Germany). The C-terminal 191 amino acids of the type I IP3R were expressed as a GST fusion protein after PCR amplification and cloning into the pGEX-2K vector (Amersham Biosciences). Expression and purification of the fusion protein was carried out as described previously (21Boehning D. Joseph S.K. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 5450-5459Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). Antibodies—The Ab against the C terminus of the type I IP3R (CT-1 Ab) has been described previously (22Joseph S. Samanta S. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 6477-6486Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The antibody was further affinity-purified using the peptide coupled to Ultralink beads as described by the manufacturer (Pierce). The type III IP3R monoclonal antibody was purchased from Signal Transduction Labs (Lexington, KY). Antibodies that recognize the phospho-(Ser/Thr)-Akt substrates (Akt-S Ab) and the phospho-Akt (Ser-473)-activated form of Akt kinase (p-Akt Ab) were obtained from Cell Signaling Technology (Beverly, MA). Recombinant Akt kinase was purchased from Biomol (King of Prussia, PA.). Cell Lysates and Immunoprecipitation—Cells were serum-deprived for 24-48 h and then treated with LY29004 and/or insulin. At the end of the treatment period, the medium was aspirated and the plates were washed twice in ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline. The cells were scraped into a solubilization buffer (SB) containing 150 mm NaCl, 50 mm Tris/HCl, pH 7.8, 1% Triton X-100 (w/v), 2 mm sodium orthovanadate, 10 mm sodium pyrophosphate, 20 mm sodium fluoride, 1 mmEDTA, 0.5 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and a 0.5× dilution of a complete protease inhibitor mixture (Roche Applied Science). Lysates were precleared with 10 μl of Staphylococcus aureus cell wall (Pansorbin, Calbiochem, San Diego, CA) and then immunoprecipitated overnight with IP3R or the indicated Abs. The Abs were recovered using protein A-Sepharose beads that were washed three times in SB buffer and processed on SDS-PAGE for immunoblotting. In Vitro Phosphorylation—IP3R protein was immunoprecipitated from cerebellum microsomal membranes after solubilization in SB buffer using procedures described previously (22Joseph S. Samanta S. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 6477-6486Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The immunoprecipitated IP3R bound to protein A-Sepharose beads was resuspended in 50 μl of phosphorylation buffer containing 50 mm Tris/HCl, pH 7.4, 10 mm MgCl2, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 50 μm ATP, and 5 nm okadaic acid (Buffer P). The samples were incubated with recombinant Akt kinase protein (0.22 μg) and [γ-P32]ATP (20 μCi) for 2 h at 30°C. The beads were washed five times with buffer P and then quenched in SDS-PAGE sample buffer (50 mm Tris/HCl, pH 6.8, 1% SDS, 0.01% bromphenol blue, 140 mm 2-mercaptoethanol and 5% (v/v) glycerol). The samples were run on a 5% gel, and proteins were transferred to a nitrocellulose filter. The filter was autoradiographed before immunoblotting sequentially with Akt-S Ab and then with CT-1 Ab. GST C-terminal tail protein was bound to glutathione-agarose overnight and was processed for phosphorylation as described above. Preparation of Microsomal Vesicles and 45Ca2+ Flux Assay—Transient transfection of COS-7 cells was carried out using LT-1 transfection reagent as described by the manufacturer (Mirus Corp., Madison, WI). Cell lysates or microsomal membranes were prepared 48 h post-transfection. The measurement of the channel activity of wild-type or mutant IP3Rs required the co-transfection of SERCA2b and was performed essentially as described previously (20Boehning D. Joseph S.K. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 21492-21499Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar) with the following modifications. Cells were scraped into a sucrose-based buffer containing 0.5 m sucrose, 20 mm Tris/HCl, pH 7.8, 1 mm dithiothreitol, and 50 μm EGTA and lysed by passing through a 26.5 gauge needle four times, rather than using homogenization. The lysates were spun at 5,000 × g to remove debris, and the supernatants were spun at 100,000 × g. The vesicle pellets were resuspended in buffer containing 0.5 m sucrose, 20 mm Tris/HCl, pH 7.8, 1 mm dithiothreitol. The vesicles were used fresh or were stored at -80 °C in 20% (v/v) glycerol for further use. 45Ca2+ flux measurements were carried out exactly as described previously (20Boehning D. Joseph S.K. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 21492-21499Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). Measurement of [Ca2+]i in DT40 Cells—Wild-type or mutant IP3R constructs were introduced into TKO DT40 cells by electroporation. Co-transfection with the red fluorescent protein pHcRed1-N1 (Clontech, Palo Alto, CA) was used as a marker to locate the transfected cells. Methods for Fura-2 loading and digital imaging of the [Ca2+]i transients have been described previously (13Wagner L.E. Li W.H. Yule D.I. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 45811-45817Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). Measurement of Caspase Activation in DT40 Cells—Stable cell lines expressing the S2681A and S2681E mutants were prepared by electroporation of 0.5 ml of DT40 TKO cells (106 cells/ml) with 40 μg of linearized DNA using a Gene Pulser apparatus (Bio-Rad; 340 V and 950 microfarads). The cells were grown in 30 ml of culture medium for 24 h before being aliquoted and subjected to selection at 1.5 mg/ml geneticin. For caspase-3 assays, the staurosporine-treated cells were centrifuged (2000 × g for 2 min), washed once in phosphate-buffered saline and lysed in a medium containing 20 mm Tris/Hepes, pH 7.4, 0.1% CHAPS, 5 mm dithiothreitol, and 2 mm EDTA. Lysate (10 μg) was assayed for caspase-3 activity in a final volume of 200 μl using 25 μm DEVD-7-amino-4-methylcoumarin as substrate after 30 min of incubation at 37 °C. IP3R Phosphorylation by Akt Kinase in Vitro—The identification of Akt kinase substrates has been facilitated by the presence of a robust phosphorylation motif RXRXX(S/T) (19Lawlor M.A. Alessi D.R. J. Cell Sci. 2001; 114: 2903-2910Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). A single motif of this kind is conserved within the C-terminal tail of all three IP3R isoforms and is also conserved in IP3Rs cloned from several different species, with the exception of Caenorhabditis elegans (Fig. 1A). To observe the phosphorylation directly, we incubated a GST fusion protein encoding the C-terminal tail of type I IP3R with catalytically active Akt kinase and [32P]ATP. The fusion protein was then isolated with glutathione-agarose and analyzed by autoradiography after SDS-PAGE (Fig. 1B). The data show that the C-terminal tail fusion protein was phosphorylated by Akt kinase. Phosphorylation could also be detected by immunoblotting with a phosphospecific Ab that detects the consensus Akt phosphorylation sequence (see Akt-S blot in Fig. 1B). Similar experiments were carried out with the full-length type I IP3R immunoprecipitated from cerebellum lysates (Fig. 1C). In this case, a low level of [32P] incorporation was observed even without the addition of Akt kinase, possibly reflecting the co-immunoprecipitation of endogenous kinases. The addition of Akt kinase greatly enhanced 32P labeling of the IP3R. Specific phosphorylation at the Akt site was evident when the phosphorylation was detected by immunoblotting with the Akt-S Ab (Fig. 1C). IP3R Phosphorylation by Akt Kinase in Vivo—Occupation of insulin receptors leads to PI 3-kinase activation and the stimulation of Akt kinase activity (16Whiteman E.L. Cho H. Birnbaum M.J. Trends Endocrinol. Metab. 2002; 13: 444-451Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (549) Google Scholar). To examine IP3R phosphorylation in an intact cell, we used CHO-T cells, which overexpress human insulin receptors (23Endemann G. Yonezawa K. Roth R.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 396-400Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Cell lysates were prepared in a buffer that contained a mixture of NaF, vanadate, pyrophosphate and okadaic acid to preserve the phosphorylation state of assayed proteins. Fig. 2A shows that the addition of 100 nm insulin promotes IP3R phosphorylation as detected by immunoblotting with Akt-S Ab in lysates immunoprecipitated with affinity-purified IP3R-1-specific Ab. In multiple experiments, the phosphorylation was evident within 5-10 min and peaked at 30-60 min. The maximal increase was 4.6 ± 0.9-fold in four separate experiments. The profile of IP3R changes approximately correlated with the time course of Akt kinase activation as estimated from immunoblotting the lysates with a phosphospecific Ab recognizing phosphoserine 473 of Akt kinase. Insulin-mediated IP3R phosphorylation could also be demonstrated when the lysates were immunoprecipitated with Akt-S Ab and then immunoblotted with IP3R-1-specific Ab (Fig. 2B). Because insulin activation of Akt kinase is secondary to PI 3-kinase stimulation, it would be anticipated that the effect of insulin on the IP3R would be sensitive to inhibition by the PI 3-kinase inhibitor LY294002. Fig. 3 shows that this is indeed the case. A small amount of IP3R phosphorylation can be observed in the absence of stimulation and could be due to the presence of a basal activity of Akt kinase. The data in Fig. 3 also show that the endogenous type III IP3R in CHO-T cells was also phosphorylated on a Akt consensus site in response to insulin stimulation.FIGURE 3The effect of LY294002 on Akt phosphorylation of IP3Rs. A, CHO-T cells were treated with 100 nm insulin for 30 min with and without pre-incubation for 1 h with 50 μm LY294002. Aliquots of cell lysate were immunoprecipitated (ip) with either types I or III IP3R-specific Ab and immunoblotted (blot) with Akt-S Ab (upper and middle panels, respectively). The effect of LY294002 on Akt kinase activity was assessed separately on a 10% gel by immunoblotting lysates with phosphoserine 473-specific p-Akt Ab (lower panel). B, the prostate carcinoma cell line LnCaP cells were pre-incubated for 1 h with 50 μm LY294002. Aliquots of cell lysates were immunoprecipitated with type I IP3R-specific Ab and blotted for Akt substrates (lanes 1 and 2) or type I IP3R (lanes 3 and 4). The activity status of Akt was assessed separately as in A (lanes 5 and 6).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Loss of the tumor promoter PTEN, a negative regulator of the PI 3-kinase pathway, leads to constitutive activation of Akt kinase in several types of cancer (24Cantley L.C. Neel B.G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 4240-4245Crossref PubMed Scopus (1736) Google Scholar). We have used LnCaP cells, a prostate carcinoma cell line devoid of functional PTEN (25Carson J.P. Kulik G. Weber M.J. Cancer Res. 1999; 59: 1449-1453PubMed Google Scholar), to examine the phosphorylation state of IP3Rs. Fig. 3B shows that the constitutive activity of the Akt kinase in these cells is accompanied by the constitutive phosphorylation of the type I IP3R as detected by Akt-S Ab. This basal phosphorylation was abolished by pretreatment with LY294002 (Fig. 3B, lane 2). Effect of Akt Kinase Phosphorylation on IP3R Channel Function— COS-7 cells have very low levels of endogenous type I IP3R (20Boehning D. Joseph S.K. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 21492-21499Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). In Fig. 4A, we have transfected the type I IP3R into COS-7 cells either alone or together with a constitutively active Akt kinase (myr-Akt) (26Ahmed N.N. Grimes H.L. Bellacosa A. Chan T.O. Tsichlis P.N. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 3627-3632Crossref PubMed Scopus (486) Google Scholar). Lysates were immunoprecipitated with type I IP3R Ab and blotted with Akt-S Ab. The only condition under which substantial phosphorylation was observed was when both type I IP3R and myr-Akt were transfected together (Fig. 4A, upper panel, lane 3). Immunoblots with IP3R Ab and Ser-473 phospho-Akt Ab indicated the presence of IP3R and active Akt in the expected lanes. To study the functional consequences of Akt kinase phosphorylation, we produced two mutant type I IP3Rs in which the Akt kinase serine substrate at position 2681 was mutated to either alanine or glutamate. The latter mutation was designed to mimic the effect of Akt kinase phosphorylation. The ability of the wild-type and mutant IP3Rs to be phosphorylated in COS-7 cells transfected with constitutively active myr-Akt is shown in Fig. 4B. Cell lysates were immunoprecipitated with type I IP3R Ab and probed for phosphorylation at the Akt site with Akt-S Ab. As expected, there was a marked suppression of the phosphorylation signal when the Ser-2681 site was mutated to either alanine or glutamate. The small residual signal seen with the S2681E mutant may be due to weak recognition of the glutamate residue by the phosphospecific Akt-S Ab (27Tang D. Okada H. Ruland J. Liu L. Stambolic V. Mak T.W. Ingram A.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 30461-30466Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). We have utilized a microsomal 45Ca2+ flux assay (20Boehning D. Joseph S.K. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 21492-21499Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar) to investigate the functional effects of Akt phosphorylation on IP3R channel function. To deal with a homogeneous population of modified IP3Rs, we have employed the S2681E mutant as a phosphomimic and compared its properties to the wild-type and S2681A mutant. These data are shown in Fig. 5. The IP3 flux response with a saturating dose of IP3 (10 μm) was not different for the three constructs and was equally sensitive to inhibition when the extravesicular Ca2+ was elevated from 0.2 to 4.5 μm (Fig. 5A). The dose response for added IP3 was also not different between the three constructs (Fig. 5B). We have also evaluated the function of the three constructs after transient transfection into DT-40 cells containing targeted deletions of all three IP3R isoforms (28Miyakawa T. Maeda A. Yamazawa T. Hirose K. Kurasaki T. Iino M. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 1303-1308Crossref PubMed Scopus (336) Google Scholar, 29Sugawara H. Kurosaki M. Takata M. Kurosaki T. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 3078-3088Crossref PubMed Scopus (373) Google Scholar). The cells were co-transfected with the M3 muscarinic receptor, and Ca2+ signals were recorded in response to increasing doses of carbachol (Fig. 5C). This protocol has previously been used to measure the IP3 sensitivity of various phosphomimic mutants of the protein kinase A phosphorylation sites (30Wagner L.E. Li W.H. Joseph S.K. Yule D.I. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 46242-46252Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). The results indicate that there are no significant differences in the EC50 carbachol-induced Ca2+ for release between the three constructs (mean ± S.E. of the indicated number of cells was 32.1 ± 4.2 (29Sugawara H. Kurosaki M. Takata M. Kurosaki T. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 3078-3088Crossref PubMed Scopus (373) Google Scholar), 31.4 ± 8 (9Jayaraman T. Marks A.R. Mol. Cell.

Metab. 2002; 13: 444-451Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (549) Google Scholar) for wild-type, S2681A, and S2681E mutants, respectively). The overall conclusion from these experiments is that phosphorylation of IP3Rs at the Akt site does not directly modify its channel function. Akt Kinase Phosphorylation of IP3Rs and Caspase-3 Activation—In a recent study, Assefa et al. (31Assefa Z. Bultynck G. Szlufcik K. Nadif K.N. Vermassen E. Goris J. Missiaen L. Callewaert G. Parys J.B. De Smedt H. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 43227-43236Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar) have shown that IP3Rs are necessary to obtain maximal caspase-3 activation in DT40 cells treated with staurosporine as an apoptotic stimulus. To determine whether Akt kinase phosphorylation of IP3Rs influences caspase-3 activation, we made stable DT40 cell lines expressing the S2681A and S2681E mutant type I IP3Rs. The expression of the mutant IP3Rs measured by immunoblotting is shown in Fig. 6A. The levels of type I IP3R in the S2681A mutant were significantly lower than in any of the other cell lines used. The reason for this is unknown but was consistently observed in several different clones. The growth characteristics of the IP3R mutant cell lines were not significantly different from wild-type, TKO, or a double knock-out DT40 cell line containing only the type I IP3R (data not shown). The ability of the Akt mutants to support caspase-3 activation is shown in Fig. 6B. In agreement with the findings of Assefa et al. (31Assefa Z. Bultynck G. Szlufcik K. Nadif K.N. Vermassen E. Goris J. Missiaen L. Callewaert G. Parys J.B. De Smedt H. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 43227-43236Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar), the TKO cell line showed the lowest staurosporine-mediated activation of caspase-3. Caspase-3 activation in the phosphomimic S2681E mutant cell line was comparable with that in the double knock-out cell line containing the wild-type type I IP3R. A somewhat higher level of caspase-3 activation was observed in the control DT40 cell line retaining all three IP3R isoforms. However, the largest caspase-3 activation was observed in the cell line containing the non-phosphorylatable S2681A mutant. This activation was almost 3.5-fold greater than that observed for the S2681E cell line. The results do not correlate with the absolute amounts of IP3R, because the highest and lowest caspase-3 activation are observed in cell lines containing the least IP3R. We also tested staurosporine-induced caspase-3 activation in COS-7 cells transiently transfected with wild-type, S2681A, and S2681E type I IP3Rs (Fig. 6C). As observed in DT4"

Here we show that the rate of Xbp-1u degradation approaches its rate of synthesis. The C terminus of XBP-1u ensures its trafficking to the cytoplasm, and is sufficient to impose rapid degradation. Degradation of XBP-1u involves both ubiquitin-dependent and ubiquitin-independent mechanisms, which might explain its unusually rapid turnover. Xbp-1-/- mouse embryonic fibroblasts reconstituted with mutants of XBP-1u that show improved stability differentially activate UPR target genes. Unexpectedly, we found that one of the mutants activates transcription of both Xbp-1-specific and non-Xbp-1-dependent UPR targets in response to tunicamycin treatment, even more potently than does wild type Xbp-1. We suggest that the degradation of Xbp-1u is required to prevent uncontrolled activation of the UPR while allowing short dwell times for initiation of this response.

Helenius A. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 2001; 13: 431-437Crossref PubMed Scopus (332) Google Scholar). The overall capacity of the ER to fold newly synthesized proteins must match the load of client proteins that emerge into the ER. When this amount exceeds the folding capacity of the ER, a signaling pathway emanates from the ER that controls gene transcription, as well as protein translation. This ER to nucleus signaling cascade is referred to as the unfolded protein response (UPR). The overall goal of the UPR is to enhance the clearance of misfolded proteins from the ER, and consequently the UPR alleviates ER stress (2Travers K.J. Patil C.K. Wodicka L. Lockhart D.J. Weissman J.S. Walter P. Cell. 2000; 101: 249-258Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1562) Google Scholar). In yeast, Ire1p is the only known transducer of the UPR. In response to ER stress conditions, Ire1p dimerizes and undergoes autophosphorylation. This event induces a conformational change that activates a nuclease domain located in its cytosolic tail (3Sidrauski C. Walter P. Cell. 1997; 90: 1031-1039Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (655) Google Scholar, 4Papa F.R. Zhang C. Shokat K. Walter P. Science. 2003; 302: 1533-1537Crossref PubMed Scopus (195) Google Scholar). By means of this nuclease activity, activated Ire1p splices the mRNA of Hac1, which in its spliced form encodes Hac1p, a potent transcription factor that induces transcription of many genes that encode ER chaperones, proteins that participate in ER to Golgi trafficking and components of the ER degradation machinery (2Travers K.J. Patil C.K. Wodicka L. Lockhart D.J. Weissman J.S. Walter P. Cell. 2000; 101: 249-258Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1562) Google Scholar). The mammalian UPR is minimally composed of three transducers: Perk, Atf6, and Ire1 (5Schroder M. Kaufman R.J. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2005; 74: 739-789Crossref PubMed Scopus (2380) Google Scholar). Ire1 is highly conserved from yeast to mammals, but the homolog of Hac1 eluded scientists for many years. The mammalian counterpart of Hac1 was identified as Xbp-1. Xbp-1, a member of the CREB/ATF family of transcription factors, does not share any significant sequence homology with Hac1. It is composed of a basic leucine zipper-containing DNA binding domain located at the N terminus. The C terminus of Xbp-1 operates as a transcription activation domain. In contrast to yeast, in which Ire1p removes a relatively large intron from Hac1 mRNA, only 26 bases are excised by splicing the mRNA of Xbp-1. This splicing induces a frameshift in the coding sequence, replacing the 105-amino acid C terminus of the unspliced Xbp-1 protein with a 226-amino acid domain (6Yoshida H. Matsui T. Yamamoto A. Okada T. Mori K. Cell. 2001; 107: 881-891Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2869) Google Scholar, 7Calfon M. Zeng H. Urano F. Till J.H. Hubbard S.R. Harding H.P. Clark S.G. Ron D. Nature. 2002; 415: 92-96Crossref PubMed Scopus (2066) Google Scholar). The spliced C terminus potently activates transcription of downstream target genes. Similar to yeast, the specific target genes of Xbp-1 encode proteins that enhance the folding capacity of the ER and participate in the clearance of misfolded proteins from the ER (8Lee A.H. Iwakoshi N.N. Glimcher L.H. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2003; 23: 7448-7459Crossref PubMed Scopus (1564) Google Scholar). Despite high levels of the unspliced Hac1 mRNA, no unspliced Hac1 protein is detectable, caused by selective inhibition of its synthesis. The mechanism of the arrest in translation of Hac1 mRNA involves base pairing interactions between the intron and the 5′ untranslated region (9Ruegsegger U. Leber J.H. Walter P. Cell. 2001; 107: 103-114Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (241) Google Scholar). In contrast to Hac1, unspliced Xbp-1 (Xbp-1u) is continuously synthesized, but it is unstable and quickly degraded (10Lee A.H. Iwakoshi N.N. Anderson K.C. Glimcher L.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2003; 100: 9946-9951Crossref PubMed Scopus (494) Google Scholar). Once Xbp-1 mRNA is spliced, the encoded protein gains stability and allows activation of transcription. Lee et al. (10Lee A.H. Iwakoshi N.N. Anderson K.C. Glimcher L.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2003; 100: 9946-9951Crossref PubMed Scopus (494) Google Scholar) previously demonstrated that an N-terminal segment of Xbp-1, the domain shared between the unspliced and the spliced forms, is relatively stable and exerts dominant-negative activity for expression of genes activated by spliced Xbp-1 (Xbp-1s) targets. This is probably because of direct competition between the N-terminal segment of Xbp-1 and Xbp-1s for the available DNA binding sites. Furthermore, overexpression of a mutant of Xbp-1u, which cannot be spliced because of point mutations in the intron (referred to here as “unspliceable”), also displays dominant-negative characteristics, when assayed under ER stress conditions that robustly generate Xbp-1s. Finally, replacement of lysine residues with arginines at the C terminus of Xbp-1u increases its stability and potentiates its dominant negative activity. These observations implicate the ubiquitin-proteasome system as responsible for Xbp-1u degradation (10Lee A.H. Iwakoshi N.N. Anderson K.C. Glimcher L.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2003; 100: 9946-9951Crossref PubMed Scopus (494) Google Scholar). Overall, these data suggest that Xbp-1u is a potential inhibitor of the Xbp-1 pathway of the UPR, and its removal by proteolysis is a prerequisite for proper activation of the UPR. Here, we examined the localization and stability of Xbp-1u and its C terminus. We show that Xbp-1u is an intrinsically unstable protein, which is degraded in living cells at a rate comparable with its rate of synthesis. The C terminus of Xbp-1u is sufficient to mediate this exceedingly rapid degradation, which occurs predominantly in the cytoplasm involving ubiquitin-dependent and -independent pathways. Against expectation, improvement of the stability of Xbp-1u augmented the transcription of Xbp-1-specific and -nonspecific target genes under conditions that robustly induce the UPR. We conclude that the rapid degradation of Xbp-1u is required to prevent uncontrolled activation of the UPR. In Vitro Transcription and Translation—pcDNA3.1-encoded Xbp-1N terminus, Xbp-1u, and Xbp-1s were translated using the TnT coupled reticulocyte lysate system (Promega) according to manufacturer’s instructions, in the presence of [35S]methionine (PerkinElmer Life Sciences). To initiate the chase period we added RNase (1 mg/ml final concentration, Roche) together with excess unlabeled methionine. Equal aliquots were taken at the indicated time points, diluted in reducing sample buffer, boiled, and analyzed by SDS-PAGE (12%) followed by fluorography. Cell Lines—HeLa and Xbp-1-/- mouse embryonal fibroblasts (MEFs) were maintained in Dulbecco’s modified Eagle’s medium supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum. ts20 cells were cultured at 32 °C in α-minimal essential medium supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum (11Kulka R.G. Raboy B. Schuster R. Parag H.A. Diamond G. Ciechanover A. Marcus M. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 15726-15731Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Epifluorescence Imaging—HeLa cells were seeded on glass coverslips 18 h before transfection. Vectors encoding GFP fused at its C terminus to the specified constructs were transfected using the calcium phosphate precipitation method (CalPhos, BD Bioscences). 24 h after transfection, nuclei were labeled with Hoechst 33342 (blue fluorescence, Invitrogen). Images were obtained with a Spot RT digital camera mounted on a TE300 Nikon microscope at ×40 magnification. Retrovirus Production—Wild type Xbp-1 and Xbp-1 mutants were cloned into the pMiG MSCV vector harboring an internal ribosomal entry site-GFP element to allow sorting of infected cells. Viral particles were made in 293T cells by triple transfection of the retroviral vector (2 μg), pMD-gag-pol (2 μg), and pVSV-G (2 μg) using Effectene (Qiagen). Cells were infected as previously described (12Iwakoshi N.N. Lee A.H. Glimcher L.H. Immunol. Rev. 2003; 194: 29-38Crossref PubMed Scopus (210) Google Scholar). Metabolic Labeling, Pulse-Chase Analysis, and Immunoprecipitation—Metabolic labeling, pulse-chase analysis, detergent solubilization, and immunoprecipitation were performed as described (13Rehm A. Stern P. Ploegh H.L. Tortorella D. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 1573-1582Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar, 14Tirosh B. Iwakoshi N.N. Lilley B.N. Lee A.H. Glimcher L.H. Ploegh H.L. J. Virol. 2005; 79: 2768-2779Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). Polyclonal rabbit anti-Xbp-1 was purchased from Santa Cruz Biotechnology. Rabbit polyclonal anti-GFP antibody was raised against the recombinant GFP protein. ts20 cells were transfected with pcDNA3.1 that encodes an unspliceable Xbp-1u using Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen). After 24 h, when indicated, cells were switched to 42 °C for 12 h. Pulse-chase analysis was performed at 32 or 42 °C. Iκb was immunoprecipitated with a polyclonal rabbit anti-Iκb-α antibody (sc-371, Santa Cruz Biotechnology). Real-time PCR Analysis—Total RNA was isolated from tissues using TRIzol reagent (Invitrogen). cDNA was synthesized from RNA samples using the iScript cDNA synthesis kit containing oligo(dT) and random hexamer primers (Bio-Rad). Quantitative real-time PCR employing SYBR green fluorescent reagent were run in an ABI PRISM 7700 system (Applied Biosystems). The relative amounts of mRNAs were calculated from the comparative threshold cycle (Cτ) values using β-actin as control. Primer sequences were designed by Primer Express software (Applied Biosystems). The following primers were used: Bip forward, TCATCGGACGCACTTGGAA; Bip reverse, CAACCACCTTGAATGGCAAGA; Erdj4 forward, GCTGGCTGATCACATTCTGCT; Erdj4 reverse, GCCGTCCAACATGCCACTA; Chop forward, GTCCCTAGCTTGGCTGACAGA; Chop reverse, TGGAGAGCGAGGGCTTTG; β-actin forward, GCTCTGGCTCCTAGCACCAT; β-actin reverse, GCCACCGATCCACACCGCGT. Xbp-1u Is an Intrinsically Unstable Protein—Previous studies demonstrated rapid turnover of Xbp-1u in different cell types (7Calfon M. Zeng H. Urano F. Till J.H. Hubbard S.R. Harding H.P. Clark S.G. Ron D. Nature. 2002; 415: 92-96Crossref PubMed Scopus (2066) Google Scholar, 10Lee A.H. Iwakoshi N.N. Anderson K.C. Glimcher L.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2003; 100: 9946-9951Crossref PubMed Scopus (494) Google Scholar). To test whether Xbp-1u is an intrinsically unstable protein, we examined its stability in a cell-free assay. Using the T7 TnT in vitro translation system, we generated Xbp-1u, Xbp-1s, and the region of Xbp-1 shared between Xbp-1u and Xbp-1s, amino acids 1-161 (referred to as XBP-1N terminus). This approach yields radiochemically pure product under native conditions. The chase period was initiated by inclusion of RNase and excess unlabeled methionine into the reaction mixture. As seen in intact cells, the N terminus of Xbp-1 was stable throughout the chase period (Fig. 1A, upper panel). In contrast, Xbp-1u decayed rapidly. Over 80% of the initial Xbp-1u was degraded within the first hour of chase, the remainder was stable till the end of the experiment (Fig. 1A, middle panel). The percentage of stable material varied from experiment to experiment, but never exceeded 20% of the initial amount of Xbp-1u. We speculate that this material represents Xbp-1u that, by means unknown, is sequestered from the degradation machinery. Xbp-1s decayed more gradually than Xbp-1u (Fig. 1A, lower panel). Inclusion of proteasome inhibitors, such as ZL3VS or MG132 had little if any effect on the degradation observed in vitro (data not shown). In addition, we looked for the appearance of polypeptides that might indicate their modification by ubiquitin. Longer exposures of the auto-radiogram showed the presence of additional polypeptides for Xbp-1u, arranged in a ladder reminiscent of modification by ubiquitin. Note that the reticulocyte lysate used for the generation of in vitro translation products is competent for ubiquitination reactions. These additional polypeptides decayed over time (Fig. 1B, middle panel, labeled by asterisk). Of note, they were observed in the absence of N-ethylmaleimide or proteasome inhibitors, commonly added to enrich for ubiquitinated proteins (15Furman M.H. Loureiro J. Ploegh H.L. Tortorella D. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 34804-34811Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). We neither observed this pattern for the N terminus of Xbp-1 nor for Xbp-1s (Fig. 1B, left and right panels). To confirm that the multiple bands, which appear at higher molecular weight than Xbp-1u, indeed correspond to products modified by ubiquitin, we translated Xbp-1u in the presence of recombinant HA-tagged ubiquitin. The HA tag increases the molecular mass of Ub by 3 kDa, and thus alters the mobility of the ubiquitinated polypeptides. We indeed observed a shift in the mobility of the high molecular weight polypeptides, indicating modification of Xbp-1u by ubiquitin (Fig. 1C). The instability of Xbp-1u in the cell-free extract and its modification by ubiquitin indicate that Xbp-1u degradation is a robust process, and may well be constitutive. The N and C Terminus Domains of Xbp-1 Determine Its Overall Intracellular Localization and Its Turnover—Xbp-1u can be divided into two parts (Fig. 2A). Amino acids 1-161, which are shared between XBP-1u and Xbp-1s, were defined as the Xbp-1N terminus. The Xbp-1C terminus(u) starts at the end of the intron (amino acid 168) and extends to the stop codon of Xbp-1u (position 267). Similarly, the segment referred to as Xbp-1C terminus(s) is the domain unique to Xbp-1s, created by removal of the short intron. To examine the contribution of the different domains to intracellular localization and the turnover of Xbp-1, we generated GFP C-terminal fusions for each. For these experiments, Xbp-1u was used in a form that prevents its splicing (referred to as unspliceable), as described (12Iwakoshi N.N. Lee A.H. Glimcher L.H. Immunol. Rev. 2003; 194: 29-38Crossref PubMed Scopus (210) Google Scholar). This manipulation was necessary to prevent the splicing of GFP-Xbp-1u mRNA by endogenous Ire1. We also generated an unspliceable mutant in which the two lysines, located at positions 235 and 252 of the Xbp-1u, were replaced by arginines. This mutation, referred to as K2R reportedly enhances the stability of Xbp-1u, probably by inhibiting its ubiquitination (10Lee A.H. Iwakoshi N.N. Anderson K.C. Glimcher L.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2003; 100: 9946-9951Crossref PubMed Scopus (494) Google Scholar). HeLa cells were transfected with the individual GFP constructs and imaged by fluorescence microscopy. The nucleus was visualized by staining with Hoechst 33342 (blue fluorescence). In parallel, turnover of the GFP fusion proteins was measured by pulse-chase analysis. Xbp-1u showed no preferential localization to either the nucleus or the cytoplasm and was evenly distributed in the cell (Fig. 2B). The Xbp-1N terminus was localized exclusively to the nucleus, most likely because of the basic leucine zipper domain and the three bipartite nuclear targeting sequences (residues 53-69, 68-84, and 69-85) (Fig. 2B). Conversely, Xbp-1C terminus(u) was partially excluded from the nucleus (Fig. 2B, third panel). Our analysis for nuclear export sequences did not reveal any consensus nuclear export signals located in the Xbp-1C terminus(u).However, it should be borne in mind that nuclear export signals are less conserved, and for their function usually require post-translational modifications, such as phosphorylation, which are difficult to predict. We conclude that in the context of the full-length molecule, the Xbp-1C terminus(u) neutralizes the nuclear localization signals in Xbp-1C terminusto ensure dynamic trafficking of Xbp-1u in and out of the nucleus. Examination of the turnover of the GFP fusion proteins by pulse-chase analysis showed rapid turnover for GFP-Xbp-1u and GFP-C-Xbp-1C terminus(u). Cells were pulse-labeled with [35S]methionine for 30 min. Within 30 min of chase, both GFP-Xbp-1u and GFP-C-Xbp-1C terminus(u) were degraded completely (Fig. 2B). GFP-Xbp-1N terminus showed much better stability and was detectable at the 60-min chase point. In contrast to what was observed for the cell-free products, in live cells GFP-Xbp-1N terminus was not completely stable and did decay over time. Because Xbp-1C terminus(u) is sufficient to direct rapid degradation of an otherwise stable protein like GFP, and because it confers localization to the cytoplasm, we conclude that the degradation of Xbp-1u occurs mostly, but not exclusively in the cytoplasm. To further investigate the intracellular location of Xbp-1u degradation, we fused the K2R mutant of unspliceable Xbp-1u to GFP. HeLa cells were transfected with GFP-Xbp-1u or its K2R mutant. Under conditions of comparable transfection efficiency, the K2R mutant in its GFP fused form was more stable than the wild type allele, as assessed by pulse-chase analysis (the gel at Fig. 2C represents loading of equal amounts of incorporated [35S]methionine). Imaging of the GFP-Xbp-1-K2R mutant revealed accumulation of GFP signal in the cytoplasm. Therefore, inhibition of Xbp-1u degradation results in accumulation in the cytoplasm, and further shows that this is the major site of degradation. We applied a similar analysis to Xbp-1s. Xbp-1s was localized predominantly to the nucleus (Fig. 2B). Analysis of Xbp-1C terminus(s) did not show the preferential location to the cytoplasm, as was seen for Xbp-1C terminus(s) Instead, Xbp-1C terminus(s) was evenly distributed between the nucleus and the cytoplasm. Thus, the intracellular localization of full-length Xbp-1s is governed by its N-terminal segment. Pulse-chase analyses for GFP-Xbp-1s and GFP-Xbp-1C terminus(s) indicated that they also decay quite rapidly, although at a slower rate than their unspliced counterparts. We also noticed that Xbp-1s appeared more diffuse at the later chase time points (Fig. 2B, fourth panel), suggesting post-translational modification(s) in live cells, but not in vitro (compare with Fig. 1A). Because Xbp-1s is localized predominantly to the nucleus, its modification(s) and degradation probably occur there. To assess the rate at which Xbp-1u is degraded when expressed at more physiological levels, we established stable HeLa cell lines derived from single cell clones expressing either GFP-Xbp-1u in its unspliceable form, or GFP-Xbp-1C terminus(s). The expression of these constructs was driven by a cytomegalovirus promoter. Remarkably, both fusion proteins were barely detectable by pulse-chase analysis, unless a protea-some inhibitor was included during the pulse and the chase. Regardless of the pulse labeling time used, GFP-Xbp-1u or GFP-Xbp-1C terminus(u) disappeared at a chase time equal to the duration of the pulse. We also noticed that inclusion of the proteasome inhibitor did not completely spare these proteins from degradation, suggesting that residual activity of the proteasome, not blocked by ZL3VS, is sufficient to bring about degradation of Xbp-1u (Fig. 2D). Alternatively, nonproteasomal proteolysis may contribute as well. These results demonstrate that the rate of Xbp-1u degradation, mediated by its C terminus, approaches its rate of synthesis. Xbp-1C terminus(u) Does Not Require Ubiquitination for Its Degradation—To investigate the mechanism by which GFP-Xbp-1C terminus(u) is destroyed, we generated an HA-tagged version of Xbp-1C terminus(u), a protein that only contains the two native lysine residues at the C terminus(u). We also generated the corresponding HA-Xbp-1C terminus(u)K2R mutant, in which these lysines were replaced by arginines. These constructs were transfected into 293T cells. Pulse-chase analysis was then performed in the presence and absence of the proteasome inhibitor ZL3VS, followed by anti-HA immunoprecipitation. Both polypeptides were barely detected by pulse-chase analysis in the absence of protea-some inhibitor, again indicating a degradation rate close to that of their rate of synthesis (Fig. 3A). For both constructs the inclusion of ZL3VS markedly improved stability of the protein. Therefore, the presence of primary amines in the sequence of of the C terminus(u) is not required for its proteasome-dependent degradation. Because the HA epitope tag starts with alanine, it is often acetylated when positioned at N terminus (16Fairwell T. Krutzsch H. Hempel J. Jeffery J. Jornvall H. FEBS Lett. 1984; 170: 281-289Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar). Therefore, the degradation of HA-tagged Xbp-1C terminus(u)K2R might represent a proteasome-dependent but ubiquitin-independent degradation pathway. To further address this possibility, we constructed a fusion protein between ubiquitin and the HA-tagged Xbp-1C terminus(u) separated by a proline residue (Ub-P-Xbp-1C terminus(u)). Because ubiquitin C-hydrolases quickly cleave the peptide bond between the ubiquitin Gly76 residue and a C-terminal extension, this method generates polypeptides with the predetermined N-terminal residue of choice (17Dantuma N.P. Lindsten K. Glas R. Jellne M. Masucci M.G. Nat. Biotechnol. 2000; 18: 538-543Crossref PubMed Scopus (463) Google Scholar). The Ub-P-Xbp-1C terminus(u) K2R construct is designed to yield a C terminus(u) fragment that carries no lysines and a proline residue at its N terminus, and therefore cannot be ubiquitinated. The Ub-P-Xbp-1C terminus(u) and its K2R mutant were transfected into 293T cells. Pulse-chase analysis was conducted 24 h after transfection in the presence or absence of the proteasome inhibitor MG132. We used MG132 instead of ZL3VS, because MG132 is a reversible inhibitor that can be removed by washing. As expected, in the absence of proteasome inhibitor very little of the polypeptide was recovered by anti-HA immunoprecipitation C terminus(u) (Fig. 3B). This degradation is probably mediated by Xbp-1C terminus(u). When chased in the presence of MG132, Ub-P-Xbp-1C terminus(u) was stabilized and gradually converted into P-Xbp-1C terminus(u) (Fig. 3B), showing that this construct is processed as expected in living cells. We repeated this experiment followed by a chase period of 90 min in the presence of MG132 to allow maximal conversion into P-Xbp-1C terminus(u). Cells were then washed to remove MG132 (Fig. 3C, diagram). We followed the fate of P-Xbp-1C terminus(u) or its K2R mutant generated from the ubiquitin fusion protein precursor in the presence of MG132, and saw similar degradation profiles for both the P-Xbp-1C terminus(u) and its K2R mutant. Removal of MG132 did not affect the rate of degradation either. Likewise, we did not observe accelerated degradation of the remaining intact Ub-P-Xbp-1C terminus(u) (Fig. 3C). Thus, we conclude that the removal of MG132 did not restore the proteasomal function. Nonetheless, the fact that the P-Xbp-1C terminus(u) K2R mutant, although not containing any acceptor sites for ubiquitination, was unstable and decayed at comparable rates to P-Xbp-1C terminus(u) supports the notion that ubiquitination in this degradation reaction is dispensable (Fig. 3D). The ts20 cells express a temperature-sensitive E1 activity. Within 2 h at the restrictive temperature (42 °C), de novo ubiquitination is blocked and the cells undergo a G2 cell cycle arrest (11Kulka R.G. Raboy B. Schuster R. Parag H.A. Diamond G. Ciechanover A. Marcus M. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 15726-15731Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). We used these cells to explore a requirement for ubiquitination in the degradation of Xbp-1u. Unspliceable Xbp-1u was expressed by transfection and the cells were incubated for 12 h at 42 °C or kept at 32 °C, the permissive temperature. The 12-h exposure to 42 °C eliminates completely the high Mr ubiquitinated species observable on SDS-PAGE. As an internal control we followed the degradation of Iκb, which is degraded by the proteasome in a strictly ubiquitin-dependent manner (18Yaron A. Hatzubai A. Davis M. Lavon I. Amit S. Manning A.M. Andersen J.S. Mann M. Mercurio F. Ben-Neriah Y. Nature. 1998; 396: 590-594Crossref PubMed Scopus (560) Google Scholar). As expected, Xbp-1u was rapidly degraded at 32 °C. At 42 °C we observed a reduction in the rate of degradation, but degradation still continued. In contrast, Iκb degradation was completely blocked at the restrictive temperature. Note the different time scale used in the analysis of Xbp-1u and Iκb turnover (Fig. 3E). We conclude that an ubiquitin-independent degradation mechanism significantly contributes to the overall elimination of Xbp-1u. Modulation of Xbp-1u Stability Affects the UPR—To examine whether the unusually rapid degradation of Xbp-1u affects the mammalian UPR, we designed two Xbp-1 mutants that selectively affect Xbp-1u, but not Xbp-1s. The first mutant was engineered to contain a stop codon immediately after the intron. This mutant, designated as “stop,” expresses the stable N-terminal fragment (amino acids 1-175) instead of the full-length Xbp-1u. Upon splicing, the stop mutant should yield the exact open reading frame of Xbp-1s (Fig. 4A). Xbp-1C terminus(u) contains two tandem proline (PP) elements. We reasoned that the PP elements might impose conformational constraints on the secondary structure of the polypeptide, and might therefore be required for as yet to be determined protein-protein interactions. These interactions might play a role in degradation. We therefore replaced the two PP sequences with leucine-histidine (LH), and refer to this Xbp-1 mutant as PP2LH. Again, this mutation was introduced in a manner that does not alter the open reading frame of Xbp-1s (Fig. 4A). Wild type Xbp-1 and the two mutants were cloned into the pMig retroviral vector, harboring an internal ribosomal entry site-GFP element. Xbp-1-/- MEFs were transduced with these vectors. An empty pMig retrovirus was used as a negative control. After transduction, GFP positive cells were sorted and propagated in culture. Levels of GFP were comparable for the pMig control and the different Xbp-1 constructs (not shown). We then assayed the expression and stabilities of Xbp-1 by pulse-chase analysis. Wild type Xbp-1u was not detectable unless proteasome inhibitor was included (Fig. 4B). These results again demonstrate that Xbp-1u is degraded at a rate comparable with its rate of synthesis, preventing it from reaching detectable levels. As expected, the stop mutant was readily detected and showed improved stability (Fig. 4B). The PP2LH mutant was detected at time 0, but was rapidly degraded. Incorporation of ZL3VS delayed its degradation, but did not fully block it (data not shown). We conclude that whereas the mutation PP2LH indeed improves the stability of Xbp-1u, it does not rescue it from rapid degradation. To verify that the different Xbp-1 constructs retain the ability of being spliced, we treated the cells for 8 h with tunicamycin. Under these ER stress conditions, Xbp-1s was generated (Fig. 4C). Following 30 min of chase, Xbp-1s appeared as a disperse band at lower intensity, consistent with post-translational modifications and subsequent degradation. Under these conditions, the synthesis of the stop mutant was still detected, suggesting that the synthesis of WT Xbp-1u and PP2LH also continues, but their expression does not reach readily detectable levels because of rapid degradation. Finally we assayed whether expression of Xbp-1u analogs with enhanced stability would affect the induction of the UPR. To this end, we measured by real-time PCR the level of mRNA of three target genes of the UPR in response to tunicamycin treatment. We measured the mRNA levels of Erdj4, a specific target of the Xbp-1 pathway (8Lee A.H. Iwakoshi N.N. Glimcher L.H. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2003; 23: 7448-7459Crossref PubMed Scopus (1564) Google Scholar); Bip, a target shared by all UPR pathways (19Ma Y. Hendershot L.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 13792-13799Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar, 20Baumeister P. Luo S. Skarnes W.C. Sui G. Seto E. Shi Y. Lee A.S. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2005; 25: 4529-4540Crossref PubMed Scopus (177) Google Scholar); and Chop, a target downstream to the Perk/Atf4 pathway (19Ma Y. Hendershot L.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 13792-13799Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar). As expected, Erdj4 transcription was hardly induced in Xbp-1-/- the GFP cells. Reconstitution with the WT Xbp-1 gene fully restored induction. The reconstitution of the Xbp-1-/- cells with the stop mutant attenuated the induction of Erdj4 in comparison to reconstitution with WT Xbp-1. This is probably because of the dominant negative activity of truncated Xbp-1. We consistently observed that cells expressing the PP2LH mutant were superior to WT Xbp-1 expressing control cells with respect to induction of the Xbp-1 specific target gene, Erdj4 (Fig. 5, left panel). Unexpectedly, similar results were obtained when we examined the induction of Bip and Chop (Fig. 5, middle and right panels). We conclude that Xbp-1u, if stabilized, enhances the overall induction of the UPR and may modulate expression not only of Xbp-1-specific but also of other genes not usually considered Xbp-1 targets. Many proteins are short-lived, a property exploited to obtain careful control over protein levels for regulatory purposes. For instance, Iκb when phosphorylated by the IKK signalosome, is degraded with a half-life of 5-15 min (21Beauparlant P. Lin R. Hiscott J. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 10690-10696Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). Class I major histocompatibility complex products are diverted for degradation by the human cytomegalovirus-encoded proteins US2 and US11, also with a half-life of minutes (22Wiertz E.J. Jones T.R. Sun L. Bogyo M. Geuze H.J. Ploegh H.L. Cell. 1996; 84: 769-779Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (904) Google Scholar, 23Wiertz E.J. Tortorella D. Bogyo M. Yu J. Mothes W. Jones T.R. Rapoport T.A. Ploegh H.L. Nature. 1996; 384: 432-438Crossref PubMed Scopus (948) Google Scholar). Both of these degradation reactions are readily demonstrable by pulse-chase analysis. Here we characterized a much faster degradation reaction. Even when expressed in stable fashion under the control of strong promoters, such as the cytomegalovirus or long terminal repeat, Xbp-1u is not detectable by pulse labeling or immunoblotting. We could also recapitulate the robust degradation of Xbp-1u in a cell-free environment, and detect ubiquitinated intermediates in reticulocyte lysate. We further demonstrate that this unprecedented rate of destruction is not achieved by coincident. Rather, the C terminus of the unspliced product utilizes nuclear export and may override the need for ubiquitination. The net result is that no physiologically relevant levels of Xbp-1u are produced. Other examples of ubiquitin-independent, 20 S proteasome-dependent degradation are on record. NAD(P)H quinone oxidoreductase 1 was recently demonstrated to bind and regulate the degradation of p53 and ornithine decarboxylase (24Asher G. Lotem J. Sachs L. Kahana C. Shaul Y. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 13125-13130Crossref PubMed Scopus (187) Google Scholar, 25Asher G. Bercovich Z. Tsvetkov P. Shaul Y. Kahana C. Mol. Cell. 2005; 17: 645-655Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar). Addition of dicoumarol inhibited NAD(P)H quinone oxidoreductase 1 activity and promoted the degradation of both substrates by a ubiquitin-independent mechanism. At least for p53, this mechanism occurs independently of its mdm2 ubiquitin-dependent pathway. We think that similarly to p53, mechanisms involving both ubiquitin-dependent and -independent pathways synergize to promote the degradation of Xbp-1u. Yeast cells have evolved a different mechanism to avoid expression of unspliced Hac1p, the counterpart of Xbp-1. This is caused by a block in translation to prevent the expression of unspliced Hac1p altogether. Why should the expression of the unspliced Xbp-1 and Hac1 proteins be avoided? We speculated that Xbp-1u, unless rapidly removed, may perturb UPR signaling. To address this hypothesis we generated two Xbp-1 mutants, in which only the unspliced open reading frame was affected in its expression. One mutant, termed stop, eliminates completely the C terminus(u) domain. This mutant generates a stable Xbp-1 fragment that localizes to the nucleus and most likely competes with Xbp-1s, and so acts in a dominant negative fashion. The second mutant, termed PP2LH, was engineered to perturb the secondary structure of Xbp-1u, consequently alter its interactions with the degradation machinery, and thus impede its degradation. This approach was only partially successful but did yield a slightly more stable Xbp-1u. We analyzed the expression of these constructs in Xbp-1-/- MEFs to assess their contribution to the UPR. We observed the synthesis of the Xbp-1 stop mutant even under extreme conditions of ER stress, induced by tunicamycin treatment. This indicates that under physiological conditions Xbp-1u is synthesized constitutively. Indeed, under physiological induction of Xbp-1 splicing, as in the case of B cell differentiation into plasma cells, or in the course of viral infection, the vast majority of the mRNA of Xbp-1, nonetheless, remains in its unspliced form. It suggests that if Xbp-1s and Xbp-1u would have had comparable stabilities, then at any given time Xbp-1u expression would dominate, which might have dire consequences for a stressed cell to respond by induction of the UPR. The Xbp-1 mutants allowed us to address this possibility. When we analyzed the induction of UPR target genes in MEFs reconstituted with the different alleles of Xbp-1, we were surprised to see stronger induction of Erdj4, Bip, and Chop in the PP2LH mutant as compared with WT controls. We cannot exclude the possibility that the PP2LH is a gain of function mutation, however, we did not see induction of Bip when PP2LH was overexpressed by itself in an unspliceable version (not shown). We also analyzed the localization of a GFP-unsliceable PP2LH Xbp-1 fusion protein, and found it evenly distributed between the nucleus and cytoplasm, very much like the GFP-Xbp-1u. Therefore, PP2LH must interact with other components of the UPR signaling pathway, in the course of activation by tunicamycin block. Expression of these constructs in the B cell line BCL-1 activated all UPR targets similarly upon tunicamycin treatment. 5B. Tirosh and H. L. Ploegh, unpublished observations. Therefore, the contribution of Xbp-1u to the overall activation of UPR targets is different in different cell types. Interestingly, the contribution of Xbp-1u for maintaining basal levels of transcription of multiple genes was inferred by Shen et al. (26Shen X. Ellis R.E. Sakaki K. Kaufman R.J. PLoS. Genet. 2005; 1: e37Crossref PubMed Scopus (175) Google Scholar). In Caenorhabditis elegans, 324 genes require the UPR machinery for transcription constitutively. Of these genes, 72 required ire-1. Interestingly, 239 required xbp-1. Only 13 genes overlapped between the two C. elegans deletion mutants. The difference between ire-1 and xbp-1 deficiency can be attributed to the transcription capacity of xbp-1u. Therefore, in C. elegans Xbp-1u accounts for the transcription of the majority of the constitutive UPR targets (26Shen X. Ellis R.E. Sakaki K. Kaufman R.J. PLoS. Genet. 2005; 1: e37Crossref PubMed Scopus (175) Google Scholar). We conclude that under active UPR conditions, the presence of small levels of Xbp-1u significantly modulates the UPR signaling pathway. The functional consequences of interference with Xbp-1u degradation in the context of a living organism still remain to be discovered."

Interestingly, a cytoplasmic accumulation of Cav1 protein does not always result in a large number of assembled caveolae organelles, suggesting a regulatory mechanism that controls caveolae assembly. In this study we report that stimulation of epithelial cells with epithelial growth factor (EGF) results in a profound increase in the number of caveolar structures at the plasma membrane. Human pancreatic tumor cells (PANC-1) and normal rat kidney cells (NRK), as a control, were treated with 30 ng/ml EGF for 0, 5, and 20 min before fixation and viewing by electron microscopy. Cells fixed without EGF treatment exhibited modest numbers of plasma membrane-associated caveolae. Cells treated with EGF for 5 or 20 min showed an 8–10-fold increase in caveolar structures, some forming long, pronounced caveolar “towers” at the cell-cell borders. It is known that Cav1 is Src-phosphorylated on tyrosine 14 in response to EGF treatment, although the significance of this modification is unknown. We postulated that phosphorylation could provide the stimulus for caveolae assembly. To this end, we transfected cells with mutant forms of Cav1 that could not be phosphorylated (Cav1Y14F) and tested if this altered protein reduced the number of EGF-induced caveolae. We observed that EGF-stimulated PANC-1 cells expressing the mutant Cav1Y14F protein exhibited a 90–95% reduction in caveolae number compared with cells expressing wild type Cav1. This study provides novel insights into how cells regulate caveolae formation and implicates EGF-based signaling cascades in the phosphorylation of Cav1 as a stimulus for caveolae assembly.

Caveolae are endocytic organelles known to participate in the internalization of specific viruses, toxins, and receptors (1Pelkmans L. Helenius A.

The major structural components of caveolae are caveolin-1 (Cav1) 2The abbreviations used are: Cav, caveolin; MDCK, Madin-Darby canine kidney; EGF, epidermal growth factor; EGFR, EGF receptor; HRP, horseradish peroxidase; EM, electron microscopy; NRK cells, normal rat kidney cells; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline; D-PBS, Dulbecco's PBS; GFP, green fluorescent protein; Mes, 4-morpholineethanesulfonic acid; TEM, transmission electron microscopy. 2The abbreviations used are: Cav, caveolin; MDCK, Madin-Darby canine kidney; EGF, epidermal growth factor; EGFR, EGF receptor; HRP, horseradish peroxidase; EM, electron microscopy; NRK cells, normal rat kidney cells; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline; D-PBS, Dulbecco's PBS; GFP, green fluorescent protein; Mes, 4-morpholineethanesulfonic acid; TEM, transmission electron microscopy. and caveolin-2 (Cav2) proteins, which share 38% sequence identity (3Scherer P.E. Tang Z. Chun M. Sargiacomo M. Lodish H.F. Lisanti M.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 16395-16401Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (320) Google Scholar). Both of the caveolins assemble into higher molecular weight oligomeric complexes (3Scherer P.E. Tang Z. Chun M. Sargiacomo M. Lodish H.F. Lisanti M.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 16395-16401Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (320) Google Scholar, 4Sargiacomo M. Scherer P.E. Tang Z. Kubler E. Song K.S. Sanders M.C. Lisanti M.P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 9407-9411Crossref PubMed Scopus (475) Google Scholar). Currently little is known about how caveolae are formed in cells and how the assembly process is regulated. Several interesting studies suggest that cells tightly regulate the assembly of caveolae from caveolin monomers/oligomers. For example, Madin-Darby canine kidney (MDCK) cells transport Cav1 and Cav2 complexes to both the apical and basolateral domains, although these proteins are assembled into caveolar vesicles only at the cell base (5Scheiffele P. Verkade P. Fra A.M. Virta H. Simons K. Ikonen E. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 140: 795-806Crossref PubMed Scopus (262) Google Scholar). Why few, if any, caveolae are observed at the apical surface in these cells is unclear. Furthermore, selective assembly of caveolae has been observed in migrating endothelial cells in which most of the caveolin protein appears at the leading cell edge, whereas the majority of assembled caveolae are found at the cell posterior (6Parat M.O. Anand-Apte B. Fox P.L. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2003; 14: 3156-3168Crossref PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar).Thus, cells are able to regulate caveolae formation to meet specific physiological needs for membrane trafficking or migration. Several studies have suggested that assembly of caveolae might be regulated by caveolin phosphorylation (5Scheiffele P. Verkade P. Fra A.M. Virta H. Simons K. Ikonen E. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 140: 795-806Crossref PubMed Scopus (262) Google Scholar, 6Parat M.O. Anand-Apte B. Fox P.L. Mol. Biol.

Lisanti and co-workers (9Lee J.K. Das K. Bedford M. Petrucci T.C. Macioce P. Sargiacomo M. Bricarelli F.D. Minetti C. Sudol M. Lisanti M.P. Lee H. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 38048-38058Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (186) Google Scholar) have demonstrated that Cav1 is phosphorylated at tyrosine 14 after stimulation of epithelial growth factor (EGF) signaling. Phosphorylation of Cav1 also appears to promote profound changes in caveolin localization as assessed by immunofluorescence in cells co-expressing Cav1 and activated c-Src (9Lee J.K. Das K. Bedford M. Petrucci T.C. Macioce P. Sargiacomo M. Bricarelli F.D. Minetti C. Sudol M. Lisanti M.P. Lee H. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 38048-38058Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (186) Google Scholar). Consistent with these findings, phosphorylation of Cav1 in v-Src-expressing cells was shown to induce aggregation and fusion of caveolae and/or caveolae-derived vesicles (7Nomura R. Fujimoto T. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1999; 10: 975-986Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar). Similarly, phosphorylation of Cav1 at tyrosine 14 induced by insulin-like growth factor resulted in translocation of Cav1 in lipid raft membrane microdomains and in the formation of membrane patches on the cell surface (8Maggi M. Luconi M. Vannelli G.B. Salerno R. Sinisi A.A. Bonaccorsi L. Ferruzzi P. Barni T. Forti G. Serio M. Panetta D. Prostate. 2002; 50: 15-26Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar).Thus, substantial attention has been given toward testing the effects of activated receptor-tyrosine kinase cascades and downstream Src kinase activation on caveolar dynamics and Cav1 phosphorylation. Whether these activated signaling cascades actually lead to increased numbers of assembled caveolar vesicles and/or their detachment from the plasma membrane, however, remains largely undefined. In this study we report that both neoplastic and normal mammalian epithelial cells respond to EGF stimulation by altering the location of caveolin protein, resulting in a pronounced assembly of caveolae along the cell periphery. In the case of neoplastic pancreatic tumor cells possessing an elevated EGF signaling cascade, excessive caveolae assembly resulted in the formation of long caveolar towers consisting of many connecting caveolae that extended into the central cytoplasm. The vesicular structures in both normal and neoplastic cells were detected using either cholera toxin tagged to HRP or by immunogold electron microscopy (EM) using a Cav1 polyclonal antibody. Corresponding to this assembly process was a shift in the density of Cav1 protein as assessed by sucrose-gradient centrifugation and SDS-PAGE. Because phosphorylation of Cav1 at tyrosine 14 has been observed in cells treated with receptortyrosine kinase agonists (8Maggi M. Luconi M. Vannelli G.B. Salerno R. Sinisi A.A. Bonaccorsi L.

Cell Res. 2002; 280: 134-147Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar), we tested to determine if preventing the phosphorylation at this specific residue might also attenuate caveolar assembly both in vivo and in vitro. Importantly, cells overexpressing a Cav1Y14F-GFP protein, when stimulated with EGF, showed little if any increase in caveolar structures compared with mock-stimulated cells. To our knowledge this is the first direct demonstration that stimulation of receptor-tyrosine kinase signaling pathways leads to the assembly of caveolar vesicles dependent upon Src-mediated phosphorylation of the Cav1 protein at tyrosine 14.MATERIALS AND METHODSCells and Reagents—Human neoplastic pancreatic ductular epithelial cells PANC-1 (ATCC, Manassas, VA), v-Srcts-transformed MDCK epithelial cells (a gift from Dr. Fujita, Tokai University School of Medicine), and normal rat kidney (NRK) cells (ATCC) were maintained in Dulbecco’s modified Eagle’s medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum, 15 μg/ml penicillin, and 0.05 mg/ml streptomycin. PANC-1 and NRK cells were grown at 37 °C in 5% CO2, and v-Srcts MDCK cells were maintained at restrictive 40.5 °C temperature under normal conditions and transferred to permissive 33 °C to induce Src activation. Cells were grown in plastic tissue culture dishes for biochemical analyses, on acid-washed coverslips for fluorescence microscopy, and on carbon-coated and glow-discharged grid coverslips (Bellco Glass, Inc., Vineland, NJ) for electron microscopy.Polyclonal anti-Cav1 antibodies were generated in rabbits and affinity-purified as described previously (11Henley J.R. McNiven M.A. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 133: 761-775Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar). Monoclonal anti-Cav1 and anti-Cav1 PY14 antibodies were purchased from Transduction Laboratories (Lexington, KY). Secondary goat anti-rabbit and goat anti-mouse IgG antibodies linked to HRP were from Tago, Inc. (Burlingame, CA). ProLong antifade reagent was from Invitrogen, and HRP-cholera toxin B, protein A-Sepharose beads, LY 294002, lavendustin A, and PP2 were from Sigma.Generation of Mutant Cav1(Y14F) and Transfection—By using Cav1 in pEGFP vector as a template, a point mutation to change tyrosine 14 to phenylalanine was generated using the QuikChange site-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA) according to the manufacturer’s protocol. The fidelity of the mutation was confirmed by direct sequencing of the plasmid. The construct and wild type cav1 in pEGFP vector further were used to transfect PANC-1 and NRK cells using GeneJammer reagent (Stratagene), according to the manufacturer’s protocol. Twenty-four hours after transfection cells were cultured for 24 h in low-serum Dulbecco’s modified Eagle’s medium containing 0.2% fetal bovine serum. The cells were then treated with 30 ng/ml EGF for microscopy or 100 ng/ml EGF for biochemical assays for the times described in the corresponding figure legends.Pharmacological Inhibition—For TEM, cells cultured for 24 h in low serum media were pretreated with the drugs PP2 (20 μm), lavendustin A (10 μm), or LY 294002 (100 μm) for 15 min and exposed to HRP-cholera toxin B for 15 min at 4 °C to allow surface binding. Subsequently, cells were washed 3 times in Hanks’-buffered saline solution to remove unbound HRP-cholera toxin, allowed to recover for 15 min at 37 °C, and stimulated with EGF (30 ng/ml) for either 5 or 20 min. Inhibitory drugs were included in all subsequent steps before fixation and HRP treatment as described previously (14Henley J.R. Krueger E.W. Oswald B.J. McNiven M.A. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 141: 85-99Crossref PubMed Scopus (617) Google Scholar).For biochemical studies, cells cultured on 10-cm dishes were pretreated with drugs for 15 min using the concentrations described above. Drugs were included during EGF-treatment (100 ng/ml) for 5 or 20 min. Cells were then washed three times in Dulbecco's PBS (D-PBS) and scraped into Eppendorf tubes, and cell lysates were prepared for SDS-PAGE and Western blot analysis using Cav1 phospho-Tyr-14 antibodies.Fluorescence Microscopy—Cells cultured for 24 h on coverslips in low serum media were fixed immediately or first treated with 30 ng/ml EGF and then fixed with 3% formaldehyde in D-PBS for 10 min. After fixation, the cells were washed three times in D-PBS and mounted on slides in ProLong antifade reagent. GFP-tagged Cav1 was visualized by fluorescence microscopy (on Zeiss Axiovert 35 microscope) using a 63× 1.4 NA lens.Immunoelectron Microscopy and Electron Microscopy—For immunolabeling of ultrathin cryosections, cells were serum-starved and stimulated with 30 ng/ml EGF for the times described in the corresponding figure legends. NRK and PANC-1 cells were fixed with 4% formaldehyde in 0.1 m sodium phosphate buffer, pH 7.4. After rinsing with phosphate buffer, the cells were scraped and then pelleted by centrifugation. Samples were embedded in 10% gelatin, cooled on ice, and cut into 1-mm3 blocks at 4 °C. The blocks were infused with 2.3 m sucrose at 4 °C overnight and frozen in liquid nitrogen. 50–60-nm-thick cryothin sections were cut at –120 °C using Ultracut FCS (Leica), and sections were picked up in a mixture of 2% methylcellulose and 2.3 m sucrose in 1:1 ratio according to Liou et al. (12Liou W. Geuze H.J. Slot J.W. Histochem. Cell Biol. 1996; 106: 41-58Crossref PubMed Scopus (435) Google Scholar).Immunogold labeling of cryothin sections was according to the protocol described by Slot et al. (13Slot J.W. Geuze H.J. Gigengack S. Lienhard G.E. James D.E. J. Cell Biol. 1991; 113: 123-135Crossref PubMed Scopus (709) Google Scholar). Briefly, cryothin sections were collected on Formvar-coated nickel grids and incubated with rabbit anti-Cav1 antibody, diluted 1:1000 with 10% fetal calf serum, PBS overnight at 4 °C, then incubated with goat anti-rabbit IgG coupled to 6-nm gold (Sigma) for 2 h at room temperature. After labeling, the sections were treated with 1% glutaraldehyde, counterstained with uranyl acetate, and embedded in methyl cellulose. Cryosections were examined and photographed using a Jeol 1200 electron microscope. HRP-cholera toxin B, ruthenium red labeling, and standard EM was as previously described (14Henley J.R. Krueger E.W. Oswald B.J. McNiven M.A. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 141: 85-99Crossref PubMed Scopus (617) Google Scholar).Immunoprecipitation, SDS-PAGE Electrophoresis, and Western Blotting—Immunoprecipitation of Cav1 was performed as previously described (15Kim Y. Han J.M. Han B.R. Lee K.A. Kim J.H. Lee B.D. Jang I.H. Suh P.G. Ryu S.H. J. Biol.

Briefly, cells cultured on 10-cm dishes were washed 3 times in D-PBS, scraped into Eppendorf tubes, and lysed in 0.25 ml of ice-cold hypotonic lysis buffer (10 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 1 mm EDTA, 0.5 ml EGTA, 10 mm NaCl, 1% Triton, and 1% sodium cholate) containing protease (0.5 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride) and phosphatase inhibitors (30 mm NaF, 1 mm Na3VO4). Lysates were then precleared at top speed for 15 min in an Eppendorf microcentrifuge at 4 °C. Cav1 was precipitated using polyclonal Cav1 antibody prebound to immobilized protein A-Sepharose beads (Sigma). The immunoprecipitated proteins were washed 3 times in hypotonic lysis buffer containing 150 mm NaCl. Immunoprecipitates were solubilized in an SDS-containing sample buffer and boiled for 5 min. Electrophoresis was performed in 12% acrylamide gels followed by transfer to polyvinylidene difluoride membranes. SDS-PAGE (16Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (206016) Google Scholar), transfer of proteins to polyvinylidene difluoride membranes (17Towbin H. Staehelin T. Gordon J.

Biochem. 1981; 112: 195-203Crossref PubMed Scopus (5867) Google Scholar) were as described. For immunoblotting of sucrose gradient fractions, 100 μlof each fraction was solubilized in SDS-containing sample buffer and boiled, and 50 μl of each fraction was separated on 12% SDS-PAGE. Immunodetection of bound antibodies on nitrocellulose membrane was performed using ECL reagents (Amersham Biosciences). All procedures were carried out according to the manufacturer’s instructions.Sucrose Gradient Fractionation—Caveolae membrane microdomains were purified from cultured cells using a modified carbonate method (19Kim Y. Kim J.E. Lee S.D. Lee T.G. Kim J.H. Park J.B. Han J.M. Jang S.K. Suh P.G. Ryu S.H. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1999; 1436: 319-330Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). Briefly, serum-starved or EGF-stimulated cells were washed with D-PBS, scraped into 0.2 ml of 0.5 m Na2CO3, pH 11, containing protease and phosphatase inhibitors, and homogenized in a Dounce homogenizer. After that, cells were incubated on ice for 30 min, and membrane fractions were separated from nuclei by centrifugation of the cell homogenates at 1000 × g for 10 min. Subsequently, cell membranes were lysed with three 6-s bursts of a 100-watt Ultrasonicator (Kontes). Equal amounts of cell membranes were adjusted to 40% sucrose by mixing with 0.2 ml of 80% sucrose prepared in MBS buffer (25 mm Mes, pH 6.5, and 150 mm NaCl). This suspension was placed at the bottom of an ultracentrifuge tube and overlaid with 0.4 ml of 30% sucrose and then with 0.4 ml of 5% sucrose containing 0.25 m Na2CO3 in MBS buffer. After centrifugation at 100,000 × g for 16 h at 4 °C, a total of 12 fractions (100 μl each) was collected from the top of each gradient.Live Imaging—For live imaging, PANC-1 cells were grown in specifically designed 35-mm tissue culture dishes with glass bottoms. Live imaging of serum-starved and EGF-stimulated cells was performed every 5 s for 200 and 600 frames, respectively, using IP lab software (Scanalytics Inc., Fairfax, VA) as previously described (20Orth J.D.

These include highly metastatic human pancreatic ductular tumor cells that we and others (21Korc M. Meltzer P. Trent J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1986; 83: 5141-5144Crossref PubMed Scopus (176) Google Scholar) have found to overexpress EGFR (PANC-1) and NRK as non-neoplastic control cells. PANC-1 and NRK were treated with EGF for 5, 20, and 40 min, harvested, and subjected to Western blot analysis using a Cav1 monoclonal antibody as a loading control and a Cav1 phospho-tyrosine antibody (Cav1-PY14). The phosphorylation-sensitive antibody has been shown to recognize c-Src-phosphorylated Cav1 protein on tyrosine 14 (7Nomura R. Fujimoto T. Mol. Biol.

Chem. 2000; 275: 38048-38058Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (186) Google Scholar). As shown in Fig. 1, EGF treatment induced a 2–3-fold increase in Cav1 tyrosine phosphorylation in PANC-1 cells and an even greater increase in the NRK cells. Similar observations have been made by others in a variety of different cell types (8Maggi M. Luconi M. Vannelli G.B. Salerno R. Sinisi A.A. Bonaccorsi L. Ferruzzi P. Barni T. Forti G. Serio M. Panetta D. Prostate. 2002; 50: 15-26Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar, 9Lee J.K. Das K. Bedford M. Petrucci T.C. Macioce P. Sargiacomo M. Bricarelli F.D. Minetti C. Sudol M. Lisanti M.P.

To extend these studies, we next tested for alterations in the buoyant density of Cav1 protein in response to EGF stimulation. Concomitant with the phosphorylation of Cav1, agonist stimulation is believed to induce the shift of Cav1 to a less dense, more buoyant membrane fraction that can be identified at a higher fraction in the gradient tube (8Maggi M. Luconi M. Vannelli G.B. Salerno R. Sinisi A.A. Bonaccorsi L. Ferruzzi P. Barni T. Forti G. Serio M. Panetta D. Prostate. 2002; 50: 15-26Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). Whether this shift represents an assembly of caveolae and/or caveolar membrane translocation is unclear, as correlative EM studies have been lacking. To this end, a widely utilized sucrose-density centrifugation assay was implemented. PANC-1 and NRK cells, either resting or EGF-stimulated, were homogenized, and total membranes were isolated and exposed to sucrose gradient centrifugation. After a 16-h centrifugation at 100,000 × g, 100-μl fractions were removed from the top of the tube and processed by SDS-PAGE and Western blot analysis with Cav1 and phospho-caveolin antibodies (Fig. 1b). Consistent with the findings of others using different agonists (8Maggi M. Luconi M. Vannelli G.B. Salerno R. Sinisi A.A. Bonaccorsi L. Ferruzzi P. Barni T. Forti G. Serio M. Panetta D. Prostate. 2002; 50: 15-26Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar), we observed a modest but consistent shift of Cav1 protein from a dense to a lighter fraction in both PANC-1 and NRK cells treated with EGF (a total of three distinct experiments). Additionally, in the stimulated cells, Cav1 became present in a larger number of sucrose gradient fractions with slightly different buoyant densities, suggesting that EGF stimulation induced redistribution of Cav1 in lipid raft membrane microdomains in both PANC-1 and NRK cells. The presence of Cav1 in the more buoyant density fractions after treatment with EGF also pointed to an increase in the total amount of Cav1 protein associated with the membranes. Interestingly, co-blotting with the phosphocaveolin antibody showed that the upward shifted (lighter) Cav1 band from the stimulated cells stained more intensely than the lower, less buoyant Cav1 band from the resting cells, suggesting that Cav1 phosphorylation may have played a role in a translocation of Cav1 in membrane microdomains.EGF Stimulation Induces Caveolae-like Plasma Membrane Invaginations in Normal and Neoplastic Epithelial Cells—To monitor caveolarbased membrane dynamics in EGF-stimulated epithelial cells, endogenous Cav1 in PANC-1 cells was first monitored by fluorescence microscopy and viewed under resting and serum-starved conditions or after stimulation with 30 ng/ml EGF. In resting cells Cav1 was localized largely to the periphery along the plasma membrane at cell-cell contacts (Fig. 2, a and a′, arrow) with an additional vesicle-like distribution throughout the cytoplasm. However, after 20 min of EGF stimulation, the Cav1 appeared to move away from the cell borders to a more intracellular location concomitant with the loss of cell-cell interactions (Fig. 2, b and b′). In addition, a substantial increase in Cav1 cytoplasmic puncta was observed, suggesting an active assembly and/or budding of nascent caveolae. Similar alterations in caveolae distribution have been observed in mouse fibroblasts in response to treatment with insulin-like growth factor (8Maggi M. Luconi M. Vannelli G.B. Salerno R. Sinisi A.A. Bonaccorsi L. Ferruzzi P. Barni T. Forti G. Serio M. Panetta D. Prostate. 2002; 50: 15-26Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar) and in v-Src-transformed NRK cells (7Nomura R. Fujimoto T. Mol.

Cell. 1999; 10: 975-986Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar).FIGURE 2EGF stimulation induces a cytoplasmic redistribution of endogenous Cav1 protein along with a proliferation of caveolae-like vesicles in PANC-1. a and a′, Cav1 localized predominantly along the plasma membrane at cell borders and at some cytoplasmic puncta under serum-starved conditions (arrows) as visualized by fluorescence microscopy. b and b′, EGF stimulation induced a noticeable redistribution of endogenous Cav1 away from the cell periphery to a more central location (arrows). c, TEM, in the presence of ruthenium red, of the cell borders of two adjacent PANC-1 cells under low serum conditions showed few or no caveolae-like vesicles at the plasma membrane (arrows). Cell borders between the cells are marked (CB with arrows). d, in contrast, EGF stimulation induced dramatic proliferation of caveolae-like vesicles (arrowheads) forming along areas of the plasma membrane at areas of cell-cell contact. e and e′, many cells generated elaborate tubular extensions of the plasma membrane or towers (arrows) from which many putative caveolae (arrowheads) formed.

Consistent with the fluorescence images in Fig. 2, a and b, resting cells displayed largely intact cell borders with relatively modest numbers of associated caveolae-like structures (Fig. 2c). In marked contrast to resting cells, EGF-stimulated cells displayed a dramatic increase in the number of plasma membrane invaginations and formation of caveolae-like vesicles attached to the plasma membrane (Fig. 2, d and e). Often these vesicles appeared to fuse together, creating large membrane invaginations that were amply decorated by caveolae-like vesicles (Fig. 2, d and e). These caveolae-like towers generally formed near the sites of disrupted cell-cell borders. Coating cells with ruthenium red dye after fixation helped to identify invaginations continuous with the plasma membrane (Fig. 2, e and e′). Because PANC-1 cells are neoplastic and known to have altered signaling properties or caveolin levels, we conducted identical morphological studies on NRK cells as a control. Consistent with our observations in PANC-1 cells, endogenous Cav1 localized largely to the cell peripheries in resting NRK cells (Fig. 3, a and a′) but appeared to move inward and form larger patches after stimulation with EGF (Fig. 3, a and b). EM using ruthenium red dye again showed resting NRK cells with few caveolae-like structures (Fig. 3c), whereas 20 min of EGF treatment induced a pronounced increase in the number of caveolae-like vesicles formed (Fig. 3, d and e). Most of these vesicles appeared as discrete membrane-associated structures and did not appear to coalesce into the membrane towers seen in the neoplastic PANC-1 cells. Both cell types exhibited a marked increase in caveolae-like structures in response to acute EGF treatment. EM-based morphometry of multiple cells was performed to quantitate the number of caveolae-like structures present within 1 μm of the plasma membrane in both cell types under resting or stimulated conditions (Fig. 4). PANC-1 cells responded quickly with a 3-fold increase in the number of plasma membrane-associated vesicles by 5 min and a 4–5-fold increase by 20 min post-EGF treatment. NRK cells displayed only a modest increase in vesicle numbers at early time points but exhibited a remarkable 10–12-fold increase by 20 min after EGF addition."

Among these, the Akt/protein kinase B (PKB) pathway protects keratinocytes from the toxic effects of ultraviolet light (UV). In contrast, the protein kinase C (PKC) family is involved in several keratinocyte death pathways. During an examination of potential interactions among these two pathways, we found that the insulin-like growth factor (IGF-1) activates both the PKC and the Akt signaling pathways in cultured primary mouse keratinocytes as indicated by increased phospho-PKC and phospho-Ser-473-Akt. IGF-1 also selectively induced translocation of PKCδ and PKCϵ from soluble to particulate fractions in mouse keratinocytes. Furthermore, the PKC-specific inhibitor, GF109203X, increased IGF-1-induced phospho-Ser-473-Akt and Akt kinase activity and enhanced IGF-1 protection from UVC-induced apoptosis. Selective activation of PKC by 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate (TPA) reduced phospho-Ser-473-Akt, suggesting that activation of PKC inhibits Akt activity. TPA also attenuated IGF-1 and epidermal growth factor-induced phospho-Ser-473-Akt, reduced Akt kinase activity, and blocked IGF-1 protection from UVC-induced apoptosis. The inhibition of Akt activity by TPA was reduced by inhibitors of protein phosphatase 2A, and TPA stimulated the association of phosphatase 2A with Akt. Individual PKC isoforms were overexpressed in cultured keratinocytes by transduction with adenoviral vectors or inhibited with PKC-selective inhibitors. These studies indicated that PKCδ and PKCϵ were selectively potent at causing dephosphorylation of Akt and modifying cell survival, whereas PKCα enhanced phosphorylation of Akt on Ser-473.

Overexpression of Akt has been reported in a number of human cancers, including ovarian, breast, colon, prostate, and pancreas (12Itoh N. Semba S. Ito M. Takeda H. Kawata S. Yamakawa M.

In addition, activation of Akt in tumor cells can be mediated by the inactivation of PTEN, a tumor suppressor protein that dephosphorylates phosphatidylinositol(3,4,5)-triphosphate (PIP3), the second messenger produced by PI3K (14Simpson L. Parsons R. Exp. Cell Res. 2001; 264: 29-41Crossref PubMed Scopus (563) Google Scholar). Deletion and mutation of PTEN have been reported in Cowden syndrome (15Waite K.A. Eng C. Am. J. Hum.

In experimental mouse multistage skin carcinogenesis, Akt activity increases in benign squamous papillomas, and this increase persists through premalignant progression and malignant conversion (17Segrelles C.

Overexpression of Akt in neoplastic keratinocyte cell lines enhances their tumorigenicity and produces a more aggressive malignant phenotype (17Segrelles C. Ruiz S. Perez P. Murga C. Santos M.

Enhanced Akt kinase activity was also observed in skin-targeted IGF-1 transgenic mice (18DiGiovanni J. Bol D.K. Wilker E. Beltran L. Carbajal S. Moats S. Ramirez A. Jorcano J. Kiguchi K. Cancer Res. 2000; 60: 1561-1570PubMed Google Scholar). Skin-targeted deletion of PTEN, which leads to activation of Akt, showed accelerated tumor formation (19Suzuki A. Itami S. Ohishi M. Hamada K.

PKC is a family of well studied serine-threonine kinases that are involved in many cell functions, including proliferation, differentiation, apoptosis, and gene expression in multiple cell types. Upon activation, receptor-mediated activation of phospholipase C generates second messengers calcium and diacylglycerol, and these contribute to activation of PKC (20Newton A.C. Biochem. J. 2003; 370: 361-371Crossref PubMed Scopus (654) Google Scholar). As a cellular target for the tumor-promoting phorbol esters, PKC has been implicated in tumor development for decades (21Blumberg P.M. CRC Crit. Rev. Toxicol. 1980; 8: 153-197Crossref Scopus (384) Google Scholar). Among 12 members of PKC isozymes, PKCα and PKCϵ have been implicated in cell proliferation (22Dlugosz A.A. Cheng C. Williams E.K.

PKCη is found in the granular cell compartment, whereas the others are distributed throughout the stratified epidermal compartments (28Koizumi H. Kohno Y. Osada S. Ohno S. Ohkawara A. Kuroki T. J.

Investig. Dermatol. 1993; 101: 553-559Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). In cultured mouse keratinocytes, the activation of PKCα is associated with regulating gene expression of differentiation markers in the epidermis, where it inhibits expression of keratins 1 and 10 and induces expression of loricrin, filaggrin, and transglutaminase in the transition from the spinous to granular cell compartment (30Dlugosz A.A. Yuspa S.H. J. Cell Biol. 1993; 120: 217-225Crossref PubMed Scopus (218) Google Scholar). Skin targeting of PKC isozymes in transgenic mice has revealed that overexpression and activation of PKCδ and PKCϵ reduces the number of benign tumors induced by chemical carcinogenesis, whereas PKCα targeting does not alter the tumor yield (31Jansen A.P.

In our current report, we explored the interaction of the Akt survival pathway and PKC pathway in epidermal keratinocytes. Previous studies have shown that IGF-1 activates both the PKC and the Akt/PKB pathways in other cell types (32Kojima I. Mogami H. Shibata H. Ogata E. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 10003-10006Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 33Farese R.V. Nair G.P. Sierra C.G. Standaert M.L. Pollet R.J. Cooper D.R. Biochem.

Since IGF-1 and other growth factors influence the growth, differentiation, and survival of keratinocytes, we reasoned that an interaction between PKC and Akt pathways may underlie some of these growth factor responses. Further, the study of these two pathways may help us gain an understanding of the mechanisms responsible for diseases caused by loss of control in cell growth or death. Cell Culture and Adenoviral Infection—Primary mouse keratinocytes were freshly isolated and cultured in Eagle's minimum essential medium supplemented with 0.05 mm CaCl2 and 8% Chelex-treated fetal bovine serum (Gemini BioProducts, Calabasas, CA) according to previously published protocols (37Li L. Tucker R.W. Hennings H. Yuspa S.H. Cell Growth & Differ. 1995; 6: 1171-1184PubMed Google Scholar). A tumorigenic mouse keratinocyte cell line, SP-1, was also maintained in the same medium (38Strickland J.E. Greenhalgh D.A. Koceva-Chyla A. Hennings H. Restrepo C. Balaschak M. Yuspa S.H. Cancer Res. 1988; 48: 165-169PubMed Google Scholar). Adenoviruses carrying cDNA coding for PKCα, PKCδ,PKCϵ, and PKCη (AdPKCα, AdPKCδ, AdPKCϵ, and AdPKCη) were reported previously (25Li L. Lorenzo P.S. Bogi K. Blumberg P.M. Yuspa S.H. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 8547-8558Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The infection of adenovirus was carried out in serum-free medium containing 2.5 μg/ml Polybrene (Sigma) at indicated multiplicity of infections (m.o.i.) for 30 min at room temperature. Fresh serum-containing medium was added thereafter. The transducing efficiency of adenovirus is over 90%. All experiments described were replicated at least twice with similar results. Antibodies and Chemicals—Antibodies for Akt, biotin-Akt, phospho-Serine 473-Akt, phospho-Threonine 308-Akt, phospho-Akt substrates, phospho-PKC pan, and phospho-GSK3 were purchased from Cell Signaling Inc. (Beverly, MA). PKC-pan, PKCα, PKCδ, PKCη, and PKCϵ antibodies were form Santa Cruz Biotechnology (Santa Cruz, CA). Antibodies against phosphatase 2A (PP2A) catalytic subunit (PP2A.C) or PP2A A subunit (PP2A.A) were purchased from Upstate Biotechnology Inc. (Lake Placid, NY). 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate (TPA), rottlerin, Gö6976, and GF109203X, okadaic acid (OA), and calyculin A (CA) were purchased from Calbiochem. Sodium orthovanadate and other chemicals were purchased from Sigma. Immunoprecipitation and Immunoblotting—Cell lysates were collected in lysis buffer (Cell Signaling) containing protease inhibitors and phosphatase inhibitors. For immunoprecipitation, cell lysates were incubated with either PP2A.C antibody or Biotin-Akt antibody overnight and then followed by immobilized protein A/G (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) or streptavidin (Pierce), respectively. Total cell lysates or immunoprecipitants were separated by electrophoresis on SDS-PAGE and then transferred onto nitrocellulose membranes. Horseradish peroxidase-conjugated goat anti-rabbit or anti-mouse IgG antibodies were used as secondary antibodies (Bio-Rad). The immunoblots were visualized by enhanced chemiluminescence (ECL, Pierce). The intensities of immunoblots were quantified, and the relative expression of targeted protein were normalized. Isolation of Soluble and Particulate Fractions—Cells treated with TPA were lysed in 20 mm Hepes, pH 7.4, buffer containing 250 mm sucrose, 150 mm NaCl, 0.5 mm EDTA, and 0.5 mm EGTA with freshly added 1 mm dithiothreitol, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1 μm leupeptin, and 1 μg/ml aprotinin. The cell lysates were sonicated and applied for ultracentrifugation at 100,000 × g for 1 h. The soluble fraction was collected as cytosol, and the particulate fraction was collected as plasma membrane. Both fractions were further analyzed by immunoblotting for PKC isozyme translocation. In Vitro Akt Kinase Assay—Akt kinase activity was examined using an in vitro kinase assay kit from Cell Signaling according to manufacturer's instructions. In brief, Akt was immunoprecipitated from cell lysates using an anti-Akt antibody, and a recombinant GSK-3 fusion protein was used as a substrate for the Akt kinase activity. Phosphorylation of GSK-3 fusion protein was measured by immunoblotting using phospho-GSK-3α/β (Ser-21/Ser-9) antibody. Apoptosis Assay—To prepare cells for UVC irradiation, primary mouse keratinocytes in 60-mm dishes or 12-well plates were overlaid with phosphate-buffered saline containing 0.05 mm CaCl2 to replace the culture medium. The cultures were irradiated with UVC at 20 J/cm2. Immediately after UV irradiation, the cells were then incubated with serum-free medium containing 0.05 mm CaCl2 supplemented with IGF-1, TPA, GF109203X, rottlerin, or 8% serum. After 22 h, both attached and floating cells were collected and stained with annexin V-APC or fluorescein isothiocyanate (BD Biosciences). Apoptotic cells were quantified as annexin V-positive cells using flow cytometry (BD Biosciences). A control sample of cells cultured in serum-containing medium without UVC exposure was included as negative control. A background level, determined from the negative control samples, was subtracted from each sample before the data were plotted. Data were analyzed using the Student's t test. Activation of PKC Reduces Akt Phosphorylation on Ser-473 and Akt Kinase Activity—To evaluate the effect of activation of PKC on Akt kinase activity and phosphorylation, primary mouse keratinocytes grown in serum-free medium were treated with 250 nm TPA for 15 min and with IGF-1 (25 ng/ml) for an additional 10 min. As shown in Fig. 1A, IGF-1 induced substantial phosphorylation of Akt on Ser-473, and this was reduced by TPA in both basal and IGF-1-stimulated status. The levels of total Akt and phosphorylated Akt-Thr-308 were not affected by TPA treatment. A time course study indicated that treatment with 100 nm TPA caused dephosphorylation of constitutively active Akt as early as 10 min (Fig. 1B) and almost abolished the phosphorylation of Akt on Ser-473 after 60 min. One μm TPA abolished Akt phosphorylation on Ser-473 after 10 min. Fig. 1C indicates that TPA-induced dephosphorylation of Akt on Ser-473 was dose-dependent. Pretreating cells with the broad PKC inhibitor GF109203X completely blocked TPA-induced dephosphorylation on Akt-Ser-473 (Fig. 1C). We examined the direct effect of GF109203X on Akt kinase activity and found that GF109203X could only inhibit Akt kinase activity at concentrations 50-fold higher than it inhibits PKC (data not shown). These results suggested that activation of the PKC signaling pathway negatively regulates basal and stimulated Akt activity and could potentially modify the cell survival pathway in keratinocytes. Activation of PKC Attenuates Growth Factor-induced Phosphorylation and Activation of Akt in Mouse Keratinocytes—Several growth factors have been shown to activate the Akt pathway in various cell types. In mouse primary keratinocytes, at concentrations shown to stimulate cell proliferation, EGF, IGF-1, IGF-2, and hepatocyte growth factor, but not basic FGF and keratinocyte growth factor, induced Akt phosphorylation on Ser-473 as shown in Fig. 2A. When keratinocytes were pretreated with TPA (250 nm) for 15 min, IGF-1- and EGF-induced Akt phosphorylation (Fig. 2B) on Ser-473 was substantially reduced. When TPA was added 15 min after IGF-1 or EGF treatment, further induction of Akt phosphorylation by IGF-1 and EGF was blocked. Constitutive and IGF-1-induced Akt kinase activities were also inhibited by TPA pretreatment of keratinocytes when tested in an in vitro kinase assay from total cell lysates (Fig. 2C). The contribution of activation of protein phosphatase to TPA-induced dephosphorylation of Akt was examined by pretreating cells with phosphatase inhibitors OA and CA before the addition of TPA. As shown in Fig. 2D, OA at 1 μm and CA at 50 μm blocked PKC-mediated reduction of Akt phosphorylation at Ser-473, and both inhibitors enhanced the basal phosphorylation level of Akt at Ser-473. Furthermore, co-immunoprecipitation studies indicated that Akt and the PP2A catalytic subunit were associated in keratinocytes to a limited extent, and the association was substantially enhanced by TPA treatment (Fig. 2E). The A subunit of PP2A was co-immunoprecipitated with the PP2A catalytic subunit, but not Akt, and TPA treatment also promoted the association of PP2A A and C subunits. These results suggested that PP2A participates in both basal and PKC-regulated Akt activity in keratinocytes by directly associating with Akt. Inhibition of PKC by GF109203X Enhances IGF-1-induced Akt Activation and the Anti-apoptotic Function of IGF-1 in Mouse Keratinocytes—To investigate the biological consequences of PKC activation on the Akt cell survival pathway, primary mouse keratinocytes were irradiated with UVC (20 J/cm2) and then incubated with serum-free medium supplemented with IGF-1 in the presence or absence of either TPA or GF109203X. UVC-induced apoptosis of keratinocytes was assessed as cells that stained positive for annexin V-APC. As shown in Fig. 3A, UVC irradiation induced apoptosis in 40% of the primary keratinocytes in the absence of IGF-1. Inclusion of IGF-1 at 10 and 30 ng/ml, but not 3 ng/ml, in the medium following UVC exposure significantly reduced the number of apoptotic cells to less than 25%. TPA at 10 and 100 nm did not further increase the number of apoptotic cells induced by UVC irradiation; however, it completely blocked IGF-1 protection from UVC-induced apoptosis. The PKC inhibitor GF109203X alone at 1 μm and IGF-1 at 3 ng/ml had little effect on the number of apoptotic cells after UVC irradiation (Fig. 3B). However, the number of apoptotic cells was reduced by about 25% with combined treatment of 3 ng/ml IGF-1 and 1 μm GF109203X. A major reduction in the number of apoptotic cells was observed with combined treatment of GF109203X and 10 ng/ml IGF-1 when compared with cells treated only with UVC or 10 ng/ml IGF-1 alone. These results suggested that inhibition of PKC and stimulation with IGF-1 cooperated to protect mouse keratinocytes from UVC-induced apoptosis. We further examined the effect of inhibition of PKC on IGF-1-induced Akt activation. As shown in Fig. 3C, pretreatment of keratinocytes with GF109203X enhanced basal Akt phosphorylation and amplified the IGF-1-induced Akt phosphorylation on Ser-473. PKC inhibition also increased basal and IGF-1-stimulated Akt kinase activity as determined by the in vitro Akt kinase activity assay (Fig. 3D). These results suggested that unstimulated basal PKC activity may provide a constant negative regulation for the Akt signal transduction pathway. Activation of PKC by IGF-1 May Provide Feedback Regulation for Akt Activation—Activation of PKC by IGF-1 has been reported in other cell types. We asked whether IGF-1 could activate PKC in primary mouse keratinocytes by examining the phosphorylation status and translocation of PKC after IGF-1 exposure. Previous studies have indicated that phosphorylation of a C-terminal residue in the hydrophobic motif of PKC isozymes, homologous to Ser-660 of PKCβII, is common to activation of PKC isozymes (20Newton A.C. Biochem. J. 2003; 370: 361-371Crossref PubMed Scopus (654) Google Scholar). IGF-1 at several concentrations was added to serum-starved primary mouse keratinocytes for 30 min, and cell lysates were collected and analyzed for phosphorylation on both Akt Ser-473 and PKC. As shown in Fig. 4A, IGF-1 induced phosphorylation of PKC at concentrations similar to those that induce phosphorylation of Akt on Ser-473. The extent of PKC phosphorylation by IGF-1 was not as great as that induced by TPA, but the time course of induction was rapid and similar to the time course seen for IGF-1-induced Akt phosphorylation. It is well established that inactive cytosolic PKC translocates to membranes and is activated by diacylglycerol upon stimulation. To further support IGF-1 mediated PKC activation, we found that translocation of PKCδ and PKCϵ, but not PKCα and PKCη, from soluble to particulate fraction was induced by IGF-1 (Fig. 4B). In addition to translocation, IGF-1 also induced mobility shift of PKCδ and PKCϵ, indicating phosphorylation of those PKC isozymes. To evaluate the consequences of PKC-mediated inhibition of Akt activity, a phosphoSer/Thr-containing motif common to multiple Akt substrates was probed by specific antibody (39Berwick D.C. Hers I. Heesom K.J. Moule S.K. Tavare J.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 33895-33900Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (263) Google Scholar) in cells treated with TPA, IGF-1, or both (Fig. 4C). This approach revealed a number of specifically phosphorylated substrates after IGF-1 receptor activation in keratinocytes, and a unique set of Akt substrates phosphorylated after TPA treatment alone. Although the identities of these individual substrates have not been determined, the co-treatment group indicates that PKC activation inhibits phosphorylation of several putative Akt substrates, but phosphorylation of several common targets is enhanced (Fig. 4C). Thus, the downstream consequences of the interaction of the PKC and Akt pathways are complex. Potential functions for the activated PKC pathway may be to provide both a negative control on the Akt signaling pathway and an altered response pattern. Isozyme-specific Effects of PKC on Akt Ser-473 Phosphorylation—To determine the effects of individual PKC isozymes on Akt signaling, we employed adenoviruses and SP-1 cells to overexpress PKCα, PKCδ, PKCϵ, and PKCη, the major TPA-activated PKC isozymes present in mouse keratinocytes. As shown in Fig. 5A, an empty adenoviral vector had little effect on the total Akt protein as well as the Ser-473 phosphorylated Akt protein. In the absence of TPA, AdPKCα enhanced phosphorylation of Akt on Ser-473 (up to 12-fold of control at the highest concentration of AdPKCα) and decreased the constitutive level of total Akt protein. Overexpression of PKCδ and PKCϵ reduced the level of phospho-Akt-Ser-473, with PKCη having a major effect even at low m.o.i. PKCη showed no obvious dose-dependent effect on the level of phospho-Akt-Ser-473. When keratinocytes overexpressing various PKC isozymes were treated with TPA to activate the specific overexpressed isoform, the resulting Akt dephosphorylation was magnified. As seen before, a 50% reduction of Akt-Ser-473 phosphorylation was induced by TPA at the tested concentrations in control keratinocytes lacking exogenous PKC (Fig. 5B). PKCδ and PKCϵ overexpression and activation reduced Akt-Ser-473 phosphorylation by 75% after TPA treatment. After an initial decrease of phospho-Akt-Ser-473 with a low concentration of TPA, PKCα-overexpressing keratinocytes has a substantial increase in Akt-Ser-473 phosphorylation at higher TPA concentrations. Activation of overexpressed PKCη also reduced Akt-Ser-473 phosphorylation but only at the higher concentrations of TPA. These dose-response results, combined with the results from Fig. 5A, suggest that PKCδ and PKCϵ are responsible for TPA-induced dephosphorylation of Akt in mouse keratinocytes. To further investigate the involvement of PKC isozymes in this process, selective inhibitors of PKCα, Gö6976 (40Gschwendt M. Kittstein W. Johannes F.J.

As shown in Fig. 6A, rottlerin and GF109203X inhibited TPA-induced dephosphorylation of Akt, but Gö6976 had only a minimal effect relative to TPA alone.FIGURE 6A, Pretreatment with PKC inhibitors,"

TAp63 is also essential in vivo, since embryonic p63−/− mice display a deficit in naturally occurring sympathetic neuron death.

Thus, p63 is essential for developmental neuronal death, likely functioning both on its own, and as an obligate proapoptotic partner for p53. During development, the nervous system is confronted with the problem of establishing appropriate neuronal connectivity. This problem is partially solved by overproducing neurons and then eliminating those cells that do not successfully compete for target territory (Oppenheim, 1991Oppenheim R.W. Cell death during development of the nervous system.Annu. Rev. Neurosci. 1991; 14: 453-501Crossref PubMed Scopus (2700) Google Scholar). The process of naturally-occurring cell death is perhaps best understood in sympathetic neurons of the peripheral nervous system, where the ultimate survival of any given neuron is determined by its ability to sequester sufficient amounts of target-derived NGF. NGF then mediates a retrograde survival signal through interactions with the TrkA/NGF receptor on the terminal arbor (Miller and Kaplan, 2001Miller F.D. Kaplan D.R. On Trk for retrograde signaling.Neuron. 2001; 32: 767-770Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar). Interestingly, a second neurotrophin receptor, p75NTR, plays a functionally antagonistic role in this system and actually promotes the rapid elimination of those sympathetic neurons that do not compete successfully for target-derived NGF (Bamji et al., 1998Bamji S.X. Majdan M. Pozniak C.D. Belliveau D.J. Aloyz R. Kohn J. Causing C.G. Miller F.D.

Thus, the ultimate survival of any given neuron during this period is determined by the interaction between TrkA and p75NTR, a functional interaction that is best exemplified by studies in animals that have mutations in one or both of these genes (Bamji et al., 1998Bamji S.X.

What are the intracellular signals that regulate naturally occurring sympathetic neuron death? Studies in cultured sympathetic neurons indicate that the prosurvival effects of TrkA depend upon PI3-kinase-Akt signaling and that sympathetic neuron apoptosis requires JNK, c-JUN, BIMEL, and BAX (Huang and Reichardt, 2001Huang E.J. Reichardt L.F. Neurotrophins: roles in neuronal development and function.Annu. Rev. Neurosci. 2001; 24: 677-736Crossref PubMed Scopus (3048) Google Scholar, Kaplan and Miller, 2000Kaplan D.R.

Cell Biol. 2002; 158: 453-461Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar). We have also previously demonstrated a key role for the p53 family in developmental sympathetic neuron death. These studies showed that p53 is necessary for efficient neuronal apoptosis in vivo (Aloyz et al., 1998Aloyz R.S. Bamji S.X. Pozniak C.D. Toma J.G. Atwal J. Kaplan D.R. Miller F.D. p53 is essential for developmental neuron death as regulated by the TrkA and p75 neurotrophin receptors.J.

Cell Biol. 1996; 135: 1085-1096Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar) and that p73, a second family member, functions as an essential prosurvival protein (Pozniak et al., 2000Pozniak C.D. Radinovic S. Yang A. McKeon F. Kaplan D.R. Miller F.D. An anti-apoptotic role for the p53 family member, p73, during developmental neuron death.Science. 2000; 289: 304-306Crossref PubMed Scopus (397) Google Scholar). p73 was expressed in developing sympathetic neurons as a truncated isoform lacking the N-terminal transactivation domain, ΔNp73, and levels of this isoform decreased dramatically when sympathetic neurons were withdrawn from NGF. Increased expression of ΔNp73 rescued these neurons from apoptosis induced by NGF withdrawal, and the death of developing sympathetic neurons in vivo was greatly enhanced in p73−/− mice. ΔNp73 appears to function in part by binding to and inhibiting the activity of p53 (Lee et al., 2004Lee A.F. Ho D.K. Zanassi P. Walsh G.S. Kaplan D.R. Miller F.D. Evidence that DeltaNp73 promotes neuronal survival by p53-dependent and p53-independent mechanisms.J. Neurosci. 2004; 24: 9174-9184Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar, Pozniak et al., 2000Pozniak C.D. Radinovic S. Yang A. McKeon F. Kaplan D.R. Miller F.D. An anti-apoptotic role for the p53 family member, p73, during developmental neuron death.Science. 2000; 289: 304-306Crossref PubMed Scopus (397) Google Scholar). This prosurvival role for ΔNp73 also generalizes to other populations of neurons, since p73−/− mice display ongoing cortical neuron death postnatally (Pozniak et al., 2002Pozniak C.D. Barnabe-Heider F. Rymar V.V. Lee A.F. Sadikot A.F. Miller F.D. p73 is required for survival and maintenance of CNS neurons.J. Neurosci. 2002; 22: 9800-9809Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), and the loss of a single p73 allele was sufficient to cause enhanced loss of adult sensory neurons following axonal injury (Walsh et al., 2004Walsh G.S. Orike N. Kaplan D.R. Miller F.D. The invulnerability of adult neurons: a critical role for p73.J. Neurosci. 2004; 24: 9638-9647Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). While these findings support a model in which developmental apoptosis is at least partially dependent upon the antagonistic activities of ΔNp73 and p53, a number of lines of evidence indicate that p53 is not the major proapoptotic protein for sympathetic neurons. First, cultured p53−/− sympathetic neurons display only a modest resistance to NGF withdrawal-induced apoptosis (Vogel and Parada, 1998Vogel K.S. Parada L.F. Sympathetic neuron survival and proliferation are prolonged by loss of p53 and neurofibromin.Mol. Cell. Neurosci. 1998; 11: 19-28Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). Second, only a partial in vivo deficit in developmental sympathetic neuron death is observed in p53−/− mice (Aloyz et al., 1998Aloyz R.S. Bamji S.X. Pozniak C.D. Toma J.G. Atwal J. Kaplan D.R. Miller F.D. p53 is essential for developmental neuron death as regulated by the TrkA and p75 neurotrophin receptors.J. Cell Biol. 1998; 143: 1691-1703Crossref PubMed Scopus (249) Google Scholar), and the coincident absence of p53 only partially rescues the enhanced neuronal apoptosis seen in p73−/− mice (Lee et al., 2004Lee A.F. Ho D.K. Zanassi P. Walsh G.S. Kaplan D.R. Miller F.D. Evidence that DeltaNp73 promotes neuronal survival by p53-dependent and p53-independent mechanisms.J. Neurosci. 2004; 24: 9174-9184Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). We have therefore hypothesized that at least one other protein functions together with p53 to stimulate apoptosis and that the third p53 family member, p63, is a candidate for this role. The physiological role of p63 has been primarily examined during epithelial cell development. The p63−/− mouse has truncation of the limbs and an absence of epidermis, prostate, breast, and uroepithelial tissues (Mills et al., 1999Mills A.A. Zheng B. Wang X.J. Vogel H. Roop D.R. Bradley A. p63 is a p53 homologue required for limb and epidermal morphogenesis.Nature. 1999; 398: 708-713Crossref PubMed Scopus (1633) Google Scholar, Yang et al., 1999Yang A. Schweitzer R. Sun D. Kaghad M. Walker N. Bronson R.T. Tabin C. Sharpe A. Caput D. Crum C. McKeon F. p63 is essential for regenerative proliferation in limb, craniofacial and epithelial development.Nature. 1999; 398: 714-718Crossref PubMed Scopus (1826) Google Scholar). Initially, p63 was thought to be required for the maintenance of the epidermal stem cell population, acting predominantly as a truncated ΔNp63 isoform (Lee and Kimelman, 2002Lee H. Kimelman D. A dominant-negative form of p63 is required for epidermal proliferation in zebrafish.Dev. Cell. 2002; 2: 607-616Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (181) Google Scholar, Yang et al., 1999Yang A. Schweitzer R. Sun D. Kaghad M. Walker N. Bronson R.T. Tabin C. Sharpe A. Caput D. Crum C. McKeon F. p63 is essential for regenerative proliferation in limb, craniofacial and epithelial development.Nature. 1999; 398: 714-718Crossref PubMed Scopus (1826) Google Scholar). More recently, however, others have suggested that p63 is important for epithelial development due to its role in initiating epithelial stratification and maintaining the proliferative ability of basal keratinocytes (Koster et al., 2004Koster M.I. Kim S. Mills A.A. DeMayo F.J. Roop D.R. p63 is the molecular switch for initiation of an epithelial stratification program.Genes Dev. 2004; 18: 126-131Crossref PubMed Scopus (532) Google Scholar), perhaps through regulation of PERP expression, which is essential for epithelial desmosome function (Ihrie et al., 2005Ihrie R.A. Marques M.R. Nguyen B.T. Horner J.S. Papazoglu C. Bronson R.T. Mills A.A. Attardi L.D. Perp Is a p63-Regulated Gene Essential for Epithelial Integrity.Cell. 2005; 120: 843-856Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (247) Google Scholar). Interestingly, mutations in p63 are found in a number of dominant human syndromes resulting in abnormal limb development or ectodermal dysplasia and also in variable degrees of mental retardation (Irwin and Kaelin, 2001Irwin M.S. Kaelin W.G. p53 family update: p73 and p63 develop their own identities.Cell Growth Differ. 2001; 12: 337-349PubMed Google Scholar). However, while p63 can promote apoptosis in cell lines (Moll and Slade, 2004Moll U.M. Slade N. p63 and p73: roles in development and tumor formation.Mol. Cancer Res. 2004; 2: 371-386PubMed Google Scholar), and has been demonstrated to play a propapoptotic role in the developing CNS following γ irradiation-induced DNA damage (Flores et al., 2002Flores E.R. Tsai K.Y. Crowley D. Sengupta S. Yang A. McKeon F. Jacks T. p63 and p73 are required for p53-dependent apoptosis in response to DNA damage.Nature. 2002; 416: 560-564Crossref PubMed Scopus (708) Google Scholar), p63 is not known to play a proapoptotic role in any developmental cell death process. In this report, we show that p63 is primarily expressed in the nervous system as a TAp63 isoform that is induced by withdrawal of survival factors. TAp63, when overexpressed, is a potent apoptotic protein in neurons, and developing p63−/− sympathetic neurons show dramatic deficits in apoptosis both in culture and in vivo. Moreover, we show that while TAp63 alone is sufficient to promote neuronal apoptosis, p53 requires TAp63 to induce neuronal death. Thus, TAp63 is an essential proapoptotic protein during neuronal development, likely functioning both on its own and as an obligate proapoptotic partner for p53. To ask whether p63 might play a role in the developing nervous system, we initially characterized its expression pattern in the central and peripheral nervous system using RT-PCR. Analysis using primers specific to the different p63 isoforms (Figure 1A and Figure S1A in the Supplemental Data available with this article online) demonstrated that p63 was expressed as both TA and ΔN variants in the cortex from E13.5 into adulthood and that mRNAs for both α and γ C-terminal variants were present. mRNAs for these isoforms were also expressed in cultured E12.5 multipotent cortical precursors and in postmitotic cortical neurons (Figure 1A). In contrast, analysis of RNA from cultured neonatal sympathetic neurons demonstrated that only the full-length TAp63α and γ isoforms were expressed (Figure 1B). To confirm this expression profile at the protein level, we performed two-dimensional gel electrophoresis and Western blot analysis with an antibody that recognizes all isoforms of p63. This analysis revealed that, in the developing cortex at the protein level, the only detectable p63 isoform was TAp63α (Figure 1C). Confirmation of the identity of this spot was obtained first by comparing the migration pattern of the endogenous protein with that of exogenously expressed recombinant TAp63α (Figure 1D) and second, by demonstrating that the immunoreactive TAp63α was not present in a p63−/− cortical lysate (Figure 1C). A similar Western blot analysis of neonatal sympathetic neurons cultured in the presence of NGF demonstrated that p63 was barely detectable in these neurons. Following NGF withdrawal, p63 expression remained low until 22 hr after NGF withdrawal, when a dramatic increase was observed in protein expression of the TAp63γ variant (Figure 1E); this is a time course that coincides with NGF withdrawal-mediated apoptosis. Given the presence of nonspecific bands, two-dimensional gel electrophoresis was used to confirm the identification of this protein as TAp63γ (Figure 1F), since it migrated at the same isoelectric point and mobility as exogenously expressed TAp63γ (Figure 1G). This analysis also confirmed that the levels of TAp63γ increased 24 hr following NGF withdrawal (Figure 1F). Thus, developing sympathetic neurons express only TAp63 isoforms, and levels of TAp63 increase markedly when sympathetic neurons are withdrawn from NGF. To test the possibility that the increased TAp63 levels observed following NGF withdrawal were causally related to the ensuing neuronal apoptosis, we expressed exogenous TAp63 in neonatal sympathetic neurons maintained in NGF. To perform these experiments, we generated recombinant bicistronic adenoviruses that expressed green fluorescent protein (GFP) along with TAp63α, β, or γ (Figure S1B). Cultured sympathetic neurons maintained in 10 ng/ml NGF were infected with one of these three TAp63 adenoviruses or with a control adenovirus expressing GFP. Expression of these TAp63 isoforms was confirmed by Western blot analysis (Figure 2E and data not shown), and apoptosis was assessed 48 hr following infection, using terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase-mediated deoxyuridinetriphosphate nick-end labeling (TUNEL). This analysis demonstrated that approximately 55% of sympathetic neurons infected with TAp63γ (Figures 2A–2D and 2F) were TUNEL-positive, confirming that increased TAp63 levels were sufficient to cause these neurons to apoptose. Similar results were also obtained following TAp63α overexpression (data not shown). To determine if this apoptotic effect was specific for full-length p63 isoforms, we performed a similar analysis examining ΔNp63 isoforms after first generating bicistronic adenoviruses expressing ΔNp63α, β, or γ along with GFP (Figure S1B). Adenovirus-induced expression of any of these three ΔNp63 variants had no effect on the survival of sympathetic neurons maintained in NGF (data not shown), and, in fact, ΔNp63α and β rescued sympathetic neurons from apoptosis following NGF withdrawal (Figures 2G–2L) as we have previously observed for ΔNp73 isoforms (Pozniak et al., 2000Pozniak C.D. Radinovic S. Yang A. McKeon F. Kaplan D.R. Miller F.D. An anti-apoptotic role for the p53 family member, p73, during developmental neuron death.Science. 2000; 289: 304-306Crossref PubMed Scopus (397) Google Scholar). Thus, only full-length TAp63 isoforms promote neuronal apoptosis. These findings suggest that NGF withdrawal causes increased TAp63, which, in turn, induces neuronal apoptosis. To directly test this possibility, we examined developing p63−/− sympathetic neurons. Since p63−/− mice die at birth (Mills et al., 1999Mills A.A. Zheng B. Wang X.J. Vogel H. Roop D.R. Bradley A. p63 is a p53 homologue required for limb and epidermal morphogenesis.Nature. 1999; 398: 708-713Crossref PubMed Scopus (1633) Google Scholar, Yang et al., 1999Yang A. Schweitzer R. Sun D. Kaghad M. Walker N. Bronson R.T. Tabin C. Sharpe A. Caput D. Crum C. McKeon F. p63 is essential for regenerative proliferation in limb, craniofacial and epithelial development.Nature. 1999; 398: 714-718Crossref PubMed Scopus (1826) Google Scholar), we focused on sympathetic neurons of the superior cervical ganglion (SCG) at E18.5, an early time point during naturally occurring sympathetic neuron death, which appears from approximately E16.5 to P15 (Wright et al., 1983Wright L.L. Cunningham T.J. Smolen A.J. Developmental neuron death in the rat superior cervical sympathetic ganglion: cell counts and ultrastructure.J. Neurocytol. 1983; 12: 727-738Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar). Initially, we characterized p63−/− neurons in culture; isolated neurons were maintained in NGF for 5 days and then were withdrawn from NGF and analyzed 24 to 96 hr later. This analysis revealed that p63−/− neurons were largely rescued from cell death following NGF withdrawal. At 24 hr, Hoechst nuclear staining revealed that, on average, only 20% of p63−/− neurons were apoptotic as compared to almost half of the neurons from p63+/+ littermates (Figure 3A). Ninety-six hours after NGF withdrawal, virtually all p63+/+ neurons were dead, while approximately 80% of neurons from p63−/− littermates were still alive (Figures 3B and 3C). Of note, these sympathetic neurons were significantly smaller than their counterparts that were maintained in 50 ng/ml NGF and had few neurites (Figure 3B). When NGF was restored to these NGF-deprived p63−/− neurons, they elaborated extensive neuritic processes and their cell bodies hypertrophied (Figure 3D), indicating that they remained capable of responding to the differentiative actions of NGF. Thus, p63 is necessary for sympathetic neuron death following trophic factor withdrawal. To ask whether p63 was also essential for developmental neuron death in vivo, we counted the number of sympathetic neurons in the E18.5 SCG. This analysis indicated that, even at this early time point in the naturally occurring cell death period, the p63−/− SCG contained approximately 20% more sympathetic neurons than did the p63+/+ SCG (p63−/−: 26457 ± 793 neurons; p63+/+: 21216 ± 1239 neurons; n = 6 for each genotype) (Figures 4A and 4B). Sections were immunostained with an antibody to tyrosine hydroxylase to confirm that the cell bodies counted were indeed sympathetic neurons (Figure 4C). To define whether this difference in neuronal number was secondary to a decrease in cell death, as opposed to an increased proliferation of precursor cells, we quantified the number of dying cells using TUNEL and the number of proliferating cells by immunostaining for Ki67, a marker of cellular proliferation. TUNEL analysis of the E18.5 SCG revealed a decrease of greater than 50% in the number of apoptotic cells in the ganglia of p63−/− animals as compared to their wild-type littermates (p63−/−: 196 ± 36 TUNEL cells/ganglion; p63+/+: 422 ± 23 TUNEL cells/ganglion; n = 4 and n = 6 for p63−/− and p63+/+, respectively) (Figures 5A and 5C). In contrast, Ki67 immunostaining of SCG sections revealed no differences in the number of proliferating cells (p63−/−: 357 ± 29 cells/mm2; p63+/+: 325 ±13 cells/mm2; n = 3 for each genotype) (Figures 5B and 5D). Taken together, these data suggest that the increased number of cells present in the SCG of p63−/− mice is secondary to decreased neuronal death and not to increased cellular proliferation. Thus, p63 is an essential proapoptotic protein during naturally occurring sympathetic neuron death. We have previously demonstrated that p53 has a partial, but essential, role in promoting sympathetic neuron developmental death (Aloyz et al., 1998Aloyz R.S. Bamji S.X. Pozniak C.D. Toma J.G. Atwal J. Kaplan D.R. Miller F.D. p53 is essential for developmental neuron death as regulated by the TrkA and p75 neurotrophin receptors.J. Cell Biol. 1998; 143: 1691-1703Crossref PubMed Scopus (249) Google Scholar, Lee et al., 2004Lee A.F. Ho D.K. Zanassi P. Walsh G.S. Kaplan D.R. Miller F.D. Evidence that DeltaNp73 promotes neuronal survival by p53-dependent and p53-independent mechanisms.J. Neurosci. 2004; 24: 9174-9184Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). We therefore asked whether p63 mediates its apoptotic effects by acting in collaboration with, or in parallel to, p53. Initially, we examined downstream proapoptotic signaling in developing sympathetic neurons infected with recombinant adenoviruses expressing TAp63γ or p53 in the presence of NGF and compared that to such signaling in neurons withdrawn from NGF. Consistent with our TUNEL experiments (Figures 2A–2D and 2F), at 56 hr postinfection, both TAp63 and p53 induced the cleavage of caspase-3 to amounts similar to those seen at 24 hr following NGF withdrawal (Figure 6A). Moreover, expression of TAp63, like p53, led to induction of two known p53 target genes, p21Waf1 and APAF-1, both of which were also induced by NGF withdrawal (Figures 6B and 6C). Finally, we examined two more upstream events in the apoptotic cascade: activation of JNK1 and induction of BIMEL. Western blot analysis for the phosphorylated, activated form of JNK1 at 20 hr and 30 hr postinfection revealed that TAp63 expression had no effect on JNK1 activation (Figure 6D), results similar to those previously observed for p53 (Aloyz et al., 1998Aloyz R.S. Bamji S.X. Pozniak C.D. Toma J.G. Atwal J. Kaplan D.R. Miller F.D. p53 is essential for developmental neuron death as regulated by the TrkA and p75 neurotrophin receptors.J. Cell Biol. 1998; 143: 1691-1703Crossref PubMed Scopus (249) Google Scholar). Similarly, increased expression of TAp63 had no effect on the levels of BIMEL at time points ranging from 28 hr to 56 hr postinfection, results similar to those observed with p53, but distinct from the induction of BIMEL seen following NGF withdrawal (Lee et al., 2004Lee A.F. Ho D.K. Zanassi P. Walsh G.S. Kaplan D.R. Miller F.D. Evidence that DeltaNp73 promotes neuronal survival by p53-dependent and p53-independent mechanisms.J. Neurosci. 2004; 24: 9174-9184Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar) (Figure 6E). An apoptotic protein that is required for sympathetic neuron cell death and that functions downstream of JNK is BAX (Deckwerth et al., 1996Deckwerth T.L. Elliott J.L. Knudson C.M. Johnson Jr., E.M. Snider W.D. Korsmeyer S.J. BAX is required for neuronal death after trophic factor deprivation and during development.Neuron. 1996; 17: 401-411Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (643) Google Scholar, Putcha et al., 1999Putcha G.V. Deshmukh M. Johnson Jr., E.M. BAX translocation is a critical event in neuronal apoptosis: regulation by neuroprotectants, BCL-2, and caspases.J. Neurosci. 1999; 19: 7476-7485Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). BAX is a direct transcriptional target of p53 family members and regulates cytochrome c release following translocation to the mitochondrion. To determine whether p53 and TAp63 have differential or similar effects on BAX expression in sympathetic neurons, we undertook a real-time PCR analysis of Bax gene expression. To do this, we infected sympathetic neurons with GFP, p53, or TAp63γ in the presence of NGF and examined the relative levels of Bax in cDNA made from neuronal lysates at 24 hr and 48 hr after viral infection. At 24 hr following viral infection, Bax mRNA levels were 5.8 and 4.1 times higher in p53- and TAp63γ-infected neurons, respectively, relative to sympathetic neurons infected with GFP. At 48 hr, Bax levels were 7.8 and 11.8 times higher in p53- and TAp63γ-infected neurons, respectively, compared to GFP-infected neurons. To confirm the significance of this robust activation of Bax gene expression in response to p53 or TAp63, we infected sympathetic neurons with GFP, p53, or TAp63γ in the presence of NGF and performed Western blots for BAX protein at 48 hr postinfection. As indicated by the real-time PCR, BAX levels were increased by both p53 and TAp63γ (Figure 7A). We next asked whether TAp63-mediated apoptosis was dependent upon BAX and subsequent cytochrome c release. Initially, we determined whether TAp63 could induce the death of neurons lacking BAX. TAp63γ was overexpressed in neonatal Bax−/− sympathetic neurons, and apoptosis was assessed by Hoechst staining. This analysis revealed that while TAp63γ expression induced apoptosis in 33% of Bax+/+ neurons, apoptosis was only evident in 12% of Bax−/− neurons (Figures 7B and 7C). Thus, BAX is required for most of the neuronal apoptosis induced by TAp63 expression, suggesting that TAp63 likely functions upstream of the BAX-dependent mitochondrial apoptotic transition. To directly test this, we assayed mitochondrial cytochrome c release in p63−/− sympathetic neurons withdrawn from NGF, an apoptotic event that occurs directly downstream of BAX (Kirkland et al., 2002Kirkland R.A. Windelborn J.A. Kasprzak J.M. Franklin J.L. A Bax-induced pro-oxidant state is critical for cytochrome c release during programmed neuronal death.J. Neurosci. 2002; 22: 6480-6490Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, Lee et al., 2004Lee A.F. Ho D.K. Zanassi P. Walsh G.S. Kaplan D.R. Miller F.D.

BAX translocation is a critical event in neuronal apoptosis: regulation by neuroprotectants, BCL-2, and caspases.J. Neurosci. 1999; 19: 7476-7485Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). p63−/− neurons were withdrawn from NGF and cytochrome c release was examined 22 hr later as determined immunocytochemically by an increase in diffuse versus punctate distribution of this protein. While 50% of p63+/+ neurons withdrawn from NGF showed cytoplasmic cytochrome c release, only 18% of p63−/− neurons exhibited this release (Figures 7D and 7E). Taken together, these results define a TAp63-BAX-mitochondrial transition pathway that is essential for NGF withdrawal-mediated neuronal apoptosis. While these signaling studies suggest that TAp63γ and p53 are functionally similar, the deficit in apoptosis is much greater in p63−/− than in p53−/− sympathetic neurons (Figure 3) (Lee et al., 2004Lee A.F. Ho D.K. Zanassi P. Walsh G.S. Kaplan D.R. Miller F.D. Evidence that DeltaNp73 promotes neuronal survival by p53-dependent and p53-independent mechanisms.J. Neurosci. 2004; 24: 9174-9184Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). We therefore asked whether TAp63 and p53 were functionally interchangeable by expressing TAp63γ in p53−/− neurons and p53 in p63−/− neurons. Initially, we cultured sympathetic neurons from the SCG of E18.5 p53−/− and p53+/+ mice, established them for 5 days in NGF, and then infected them with an adenovirus expressing TAp63γ. TUNEL analysis 48 hr later revealed that TAp63γ could effectively induce the apoptosis of both p53−/− and p53+/+ neurons (Figures 8A and 8C). Similar result"

https://openalex.org/W2003097283,"Cyclin-dependent kinase 2 (CDK2) has been proposed to function as a master regulator of centrosome duplication. Using mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs) in which Cdk2 has been genetically deleted, we show here that CDK2 is not required for normal centrosome duplication, maturation and bipolar mitotic spindle formation. In contrast, Cdk2 deficiency completely abrogates aberrant centrosome duplication induced by a viral oncogene. Mechanistically, centrosome overduplication in MEFs wild-type for Cdk2 involves the formation of supernumerary immature centrosomes. These results indicate that normal and abnormal centrosome duplication have significantly different requirements for CDK2 activity and point to a role of CDK2 in licensing centrosomes for aberrant duplication. Furthermore, our findings suggest that CDK2 may be a suitable therapeutic target to inhibit centrosome-mediated chromosomal instability in tumor cells."

We hypothesized an interaction between the low density lipoprotein receptor family members and the NMDA receptor. In the present study, we confirmed through co-immunoprecipitation experiments an interaction between the apoE receptor, ApoEr2, and NMDAR1 through their extracellular domains. We also found that the PDZ1 domain of PSD95, a postsynaptic scaffolding protein, interacted with the C terminus of ApoEr2 via an alternatively spliced, intracellular exon. This interaction between ApoEr2 and PSD95 in neurons was modulated by NMDA receptor activation and an ApoEr2 ligand. We also found that the PDZ2 domain of PSD95 interacted with the NR2A and NR2B subunits of NMDA receptors.

These processes mediate synaptic plasticity and responses to neurodegeneration. ApoE-containing lipoproteins are endocytosed into cells via apoE receptors, including the low density lipoprotein receptor, low density lipoprotein receptor-related protein (LRP1), very low density lipoprotein receptor, apoE receptor type 2 (ApoEr2), and the LR11 receptor (2Beffert U.

Ligand activation of these receptors has also been implicated in a variety of neuronal signaling processes. These receptors play roles in neuronal migration during development (3Dulabon L. Olson E.C.

Neurochem. 2005; 93: 145-155Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar). The activation of ERK 1/2 by apoE was blocked by an inhibitor to the low density lipoprotein receptor family, the NMDA receptor antagonist MK 801, and calcium channel blockers. We also found that apoE promoted extracellular and intramembranous cleavages of these receptors, affecting metabolism of their C-terminal fragments (8Hoe H.S. Rebeck G.W. Brain Res. Mol.

Several in vivo and in vitro studies have supported roles for apoE and apoE receptors in signaling processes involving NMDA channels. ApoE targeted replacement mice revealed that long term potentiation (LTP) was significantly greater in animals expressing mouse apoE or human apoE3 than in apoE knock-out (9Trommer B.L. Shah C. Yun S.H. Gamkrelidze G. Pasternak E.S. Ye G.L. Sotak M. Sullivan P.M. Pasternak J.F. Ladu M.J.

Biochemical and immunohistochemical studies showed that the LRP1 interacts with NMDA receptors and the postsynaptic density protein PSD95 (12May P. Rohlmann A. Bock H.H. Zurhove K. Marth J.D.

These data suggest that LRP1, and potentially other apoE receptors, can modulate LTP (12May P. Rohlmann A. Bock H.H. Zurhove K. Marth J.D. Schomburg E.D. Noebels J.L. Beffert U. Sweatt J.D. Weeber E.J. Herz J. Mol. Cell Biol. 2004; 24: 8872-8883Crossref PubMed Scopus (171) Google Scholar). The heteromeric NMDA receptors (NMDAR) are ligand-gated ion channels. The NR1 subunit is present in all NMDARs in combination with NR2 (NR2A-NR2D) or NR3 subunits (13Wenthold R.J. Prybylowski K. Standley S. Sans N. Petralia R.S. Annu. Rev. Pharmacol. Toxicol. 2003; 43: 335-358Crossref PubMed Scopus (293) Google Scholar). The trafficking of the NMDA receptor to the synapse and its location within the synapse are dependent on various extracellular and intracellular interactions. The NR2 subunits interact, through their C termini, with PSD95, a protein found abundantly in the postsynaptic density. PSD95 has three PDZ domains, one Src homology 3 domain, and one guanylate kinase domain (14McGee A. Dakoji S.R. Osen O. Bredt D.S. Lim W.A. Prehoda K.E. Mol.

These studies suggest that apoE receptors may interact with NMDA receptors, potentially affecting their activity. In this work, we investigated the mechanisms of ApoEr2 interactions with NMDA receptors. We demonstrate that NMDAR1 interacts with the extracellular portion of ApoEr2 and affects its processing. Furthermore, we found that PSD95, through its first PDZ domain, interacts with the intracellular domain of ApoEr2 and, through its second PDZ domain, interacts with NMDAR2 subunits. We suggest that PSD95 functions as a link between ApoEr2 and NMDAR2 subunits, thus potentially modulating calcium influx, cell signaling, and LTP. Vector Construction—We produced several deletion constructs of ApoEr2. Each construct of mouse ApoEr2 was generated with a C-terminal HA tag in the pcDNA flux3 expression vector: 1) residues 1-214; 2) residues 215-401; 3) residues 402-614; 4) residues 615-842; 5) residues 1-614; 6) residues 1-826; and 7) residues 1-842. The ApoEr2 constructs lacked ligand binding repeats 4-6 and included the alternately spliced cytoplasmic insert (19Brandes C. Kahr L. Stockinger W. Hiesberger T. Schneider W.J. Nimpf J. J. Biol.

We also generated several constructs of C-terminal ApoEr2 containing only exon 18, only exon 19, or exons 18 and 19. Full-length PSD95 with a C-terminal GFP tag was the kind gift of Dr. David Bredt (University of California, San Francisco). We generated five deletion constructs, also with C-terminal GFP tags: 1) residues 337-2175; 2) residues 735-2175; 3) residues 1047-2175; 4) residues 1-336; and 5) 1-2175 residues. Recombinant DNA was confirmed by sequencing and expression of correctly sized proteins was confirmed by Western blot using an anti-GFP antibody. Cell Lines and Culture Conditions—COS7 and human embryonic kidney cells were maintained in Opti-MEM (Invitrogen) with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS, Invitrogen) in a 10% CO2 incubator. Cells were transiently transfected with 0.5-1 μg of plasmid in FuGENE 6 (Roche Diagnostics) according to the manufacturer's protocol and cultured 24 h in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 10% FBS. For co-transfections, cells were similarly transfected with 0.5-1 μg of each plasmid in FuGENE 6 (Roche) and cultured 24 h in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium with 10% FBS. After 24 h the cells were transferred to Opti-MEM serum-free media (Invitrogen) and then receptor ligands were added, including an apoE-derived peptide. The apoE tandem repeat peptide (LRKLRKRLLLRKLRKRLL) was synthesized by Johns Hopkins University of Medicine (Biosynthesis and Sequencing Facility, Baltimore, MD). Antibodies—We used antibodies anti-HA (Abcam), anti-c-myc (Abcam), anti-GFP (Roche), anti-FLAG (Sigma), and anti-PSD95 (Abcam). Antibody 5810 was raised in a rabbit against a recombinant protein of the first three ligand binding repeats of mouse ApoEr2 (20Hoe H.S. Wessner D. Beffert U. Becker A.G. Matsuoka Y. Rebeck G.W. Mol.

Antibodies against NR1 (monoclonal, recognizing amino acids 656-811), NR2A (polyclonal, against amino acids 934-1142), and NR2B (monoclonal, recognizing amino acids 934-1457) were generous gifts of Dr. Barry Wolfe at Georgetown University. Quantification of ApoEr2 Proteolytic Fragments—COS7 cells were transiently transfected with constructs for ApoEr2, NR1, NR2, or PSD95, and then cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 10% FBS for 24 h. Cells were maintained for another 24 h in serum-free media. Secreted ApoEr2 was determined by Western blot analysis from the media. Proteins in conditioned media (15 μl) were separated by 4-15% polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, transferred to nitrocellulose membranes, and probed with the 5810 antibody. ApoEr2 C-terminal fragments (CTF) were measured in cell lysates (lysis buffer: 50 mm Tris, pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl, 0.25% deoxycholate, 1% Nonidet-40, 1 mm EDTA with protease inhibitors (Roche) and phosphatase inhibitors (Sigma)). Proteins were separated electrophoretically and analyzed using the HA antibody by Western blots. Primary Neuronal Cell Culture—Primary mouse embryonic cortical neuron cultures were prepared from embryonic day 16 Swiss-Webster mice as previously described (21Qiu Z. Strickland D.K. Hyman B.T.

After trypsinization, 0.4 μg/ml trypsin inhibitor, 0.025% DNase, and 12 mm MgSO4 were added and mixed until tissue was thoroughly homogenized. Cells were then transferred to Neurobasal medium containing B27 serum supplement, 1 mm glutamine, gentamycin, and Ara-C. Neurons were seeded on 50 μg/ml poly-d-lysine-coated 12-well tissue culture plates at a density of 2 × 106 cells. For analysis of the PSD95-ApoEr2, cells at 10 days in vitro were treated with buffer, 1 μm MK 801 (in Me2SO) for 1 h, or 100 μm NMDA (in water) for 10 min. Cells were lysed in lysis buffer, but cell debris was not centrifuged to prevent loss of NMDA receptors in the cell pellet. Co-immunoprecipitations—Transfected COS7 cells were washed with phosphate-buffered saline and lysed in buffer containing 50 mm Tris (pH 8.0), 150 mm NaCl, 1% Nonidet P-40, and phosphatase and protease inhibitors. For immunoprecipitations, equal levels of cell proteins were incubated for 2 h at 4°C with the antibodies in the presence of protein G-Sepharose beads (Amersham Biosciences). The precipitates were then washed three times with lysis buffer and resuspended in SDS sample buffer. The samples were separated on 4-15% polyacrylamide gels, transferred electrophoretically to nitrocellulose membranes, and blocked with 5% nonfat dry milk. The blots were incubated with antibodies at room temperature for 1 h. Horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibodies were visualized by chemiluminescence and exposed to film. Cell Surface Protein Labeling—COS7 cells were transiently transfected with ApoEr2 and cultured 24 h in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 10% FBS. After 24 h, medium was changed to serum free. After 24 h, cells were washed twice with phosphate-buffered saline, and surface proteins were labeled with Sulfo-NHS-SS-biotin (Pierce) with gentle shaking at 4 °C for 30 min. Quenching solution was added to cells, which were washed twice with Tris-buffered saline. Cells were collected in lysis buffer, disrupted by sonication on ice, incubated for 30 min on ice, and clarified by centrifugation (10,000 × g, 2 min). To isolate biotin-labeled proteins, lysate was added to immobilized NeutrAvidin® gel and incubated 1 h at room temperature. Gels were washed 5 times with wash buffer and incubated 1 h with SDS-PAGE sample buffer including 50 mm dithiothreitol. Equal levels of biotinylated proteins (10-25 μg) were then separated by polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, and specific surface proteins were measured by immunoblotting. Live Cell Staining—Human embryonic kidney cells were incubated with primary antibody in ECS (145 mm NaCl, 5 mm KCl, 1 mm MgCl2, 1 mm CaCl2, 5 mm HEPES, 5 mm glucose, 15 mm sucrose, 0.25 mg/liter phenol red, and 10 μm d-serine (all from Sigma), adjusted to pH 7.4 with NaOH) for 8 min at room temperature. Cells were washed three times in ECS and then incubated with anti-ApoEr2 antibody for 8 min, washed in ECS, and incubated with Alexa Fluor 555 (Molecular Probes) goat anti-rabbit antibody for 8 min at room temperature. Final washes were carried out with ECS. Cells were fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde and mounted in GVA mount (Zymed Laboratories Inc.). Stained cells were viewed with and imaged on an Axioskop FS microscope (Zeiss, Germany) equipped with a ×63, 0.9 NA, Achroplan water immersion objective or with a Nikon E600 microscipe (Nikon, Japan) equipped with a ×60, 1.0 NA. Mouse Brains—Brains were isolated from 3-month-old male Swiss-Webster mice. Lysates were prepared in lysis buffer and not centrifuged to prevent loss of proteins that preferentially remained with cell densities. Osmotic Infusion—Guide cannula were inserted through holes drilled in the skull to the following coordinates from bregma: AP, -3.8; ML, -2.2; DV, -2.6 (22Watson P. The Rat Brain in Stereotaxic Coordinates. Academic Press, San Diego, CA1998Google Scholar). To minimize damage to target structures, the guide cannula were aimed 1-mm dorsal to the intended site of infusion. Three screws were anchored in the skull between the cannula to help anchor the protective cap that was formed by cranioplastic cement. The cement, a two-part acrylic-based medium, was applied to secure the cannula and to cover the incision area. Osmotic minipumps (200 μl, Alzet 2001) were subcutaneously implanted in the rats at the same time as the cannulation procedure. Half of the rats were infused with saline and the other half received 2 μm apoE peptide at a rate of ∼1 μl/h for 1 week. This approach delivered approximately 336 pmoles of apoE. Statistical Analyses—All co-immunoprecipitation and immunoblot experiments were repeated a minimum of four times. Data were analyzed using analysis of variance with Graphpad Prism 4 software, using Tukey's Multiple Comparison test for post-hoc analyses with significance determined as p < 0.05. ApoEr2 Directly Interacts with NMDAR1—In our previous studies we showed that ligand binding to apoE receptors in neurons altered intracellular kinase activation, including activating extracellular signal-regulated kinase 1/2 (ERK 1/2) (7Hoe H.S. Harris D.C. Rebeck G.W. J. Neurochem. 2005; 93: 145-155Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar). ERK 1/2 activation required active NMDA receptors and calcium influx, suggesting that some apoE receptors interact with NMDA receptors (7Hoe H.S. Harris D.C. Rebeck G.W. J. Neurochem. 2005; 93: 145-155Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar). To test whether ApoEr2 directly interacted with the NMDA receptor, we transfected COS7 cells with ApoEr2 and NR1, immunoprecipitated NR1, and probed the precipitates with anti-HA. Full-length ApoEr2 co-precipitated with NR1 (Fig. 1A, upper panel). In the absence of co-expressed NR1, co-precipitation was not observed (lane 3). Western blot analysis of COS7 cell extracts confirmed that levels of total NR1 were consistent across transfections (Fig. 1A, lower panel). As controls, no co-precipitation was observed in the absence of precipitating antibody, and anti-ApoEr2 co-precipitated NR1 in transfected COS7 cells (data not shown). To test whether this interaction was merely the result of overexpressed proteins interacting in a cell, we examined whether native ApoEr2 and NR1 co-precipitated in brain lysates and primary neuronal cultures. We incubated mouse brain lysates with 5810 (α-ApoEr2), and probed the precipitates with NR1 antibody. As in transfected cells, ApoEr2 and NR1 co-immunoprecipitated (Fig. 1B, lane 2). No NR1 was detected in control experiments performed with nonimmune serum (Fig. 1B, lane 1). Similarly, immunoprecipitation of ApoEr2 from primary neuronal cultures resulted in precipitation of NR1 (Fig. 1C, lane 2). No ApoEr2 was detected in control experiments with nonimmune serum (Fig. 1C, lane 1). As a positive control, we immunoprecipitated NR1 and probed with anti-NR1 (Fig. 1C, lane 3), demonstrating a strong band of NR1 immunoreactivity in primary neuronal cells. Extracellular Domain of ApoEr2 Interacts with NR1—To determine which domain of ApoEr2 interacted with NR1, we transfected COS7 cells with ApoEr2 deletion constructs created with different N-terminal deletions (Fig. 2A, constructs 1, 2, 3, and 5) and C-terminal deletions (Fig. 2A, constructs 4 and 6). Proteins of expected sizes were expressed from each construct to similar levels, as determined by Western blots with anti-HA (data not shown). We incubated cell lysates with anti-NR1 and probed the precipitates with anti-HA. Constructs possessing the full extracellular domain of ApoEr2 (5, 6, and 7) co-precipitated with NR1 (Fig. 2B). Constructs containing all (7) or most (6) of the intracellular domain co-precipitated to a much greater extent than the construct containing only the extracellular domain (5). Importantly, construct 5 encoded for a protein with only the extracellular domain and without the transmembrane domain; its co-precipitation with NR1 is not an interaction between two transmembrane proteins. Expression of individual extracellular domains (the ligand binding, epidermal growth factor, and O-linked domains), did not immunoprecipitate with NR1, also confirming that ApoEr2 did not co-precipitate nonspecifically with overexpressed proteins (including membrane proteins (construct 4)). NR1 protein was similarly expressed in all samples (Fig. 2B, lower panel). NR1 and NR2 Subunits Affect ApoEr2 Processing—ApoEr2 undergoes regulated proteolysis (8Hoe H.S. Rebeck G.W. Brain Res. Mol. Brain Res. 2005; 137: 31-39Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar); an interaction between NR1 and ApoEr2 raised the possibility that this proteolysis could be altered by NR1. Thus, we co-transfected COS7 cells with NR1 and ApoEr2 and assessed changes in the levels of secreted ApoEr2 and ApoEr2 CTF. Transfection of the vector alone did not alter ApoEr2 proteolysis (data not shown). Co-expression of NR1 increased secreted ApoEr2 and ApoEr2 CTF compared with cells co-transfected with the control vector (Fig. 3A). There were no obvious changes in total cellular ApoEr2 levels. These data suggest that the interaction between NR1 affects the processing of ApoEr2. We then asked whether NR2 subunits also affected ApoEr2 processing. COS7 cells were co-transfected with NR2 subunits and ApoEr2. We found that the NR2B and NR2D subunits strongly increased levels of secreted ApoEr2 and ApoEr2 CTF without affecting total ApoEr2 levels (Fig. 3B). NR2A and NR2C had relatively minor effects on ApoEr2 processing (Fig. 3B), although there was an apparent decrease in the secreted forms of ApoEr2 (Fig. 3B). These data suggest that various NR2 subunits can alter ApoEr2 processing. PSD95 Interacts with the Cytoplasmic Domain of ApoEr2—A recent study showed that PSD95, a postsynaptic scaffolding protein, interacted with ApoEr2 in a yeast two-hybrid system and co-immunoprecipitated (23Gotthardt M. Trommsdorff M. Nevitt M.F. Shelton J. Richardson J.A. Stockinger W. Nimpf J. Herz J. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 25616-25624Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (398) Google Scholar, 24Beffert U. Weeber E.J. Durudas A. Qiu S. Masiulis I. Sweatt J.D. Li W.P. Adelmann G. Frotscher M. Hammer R.E. Herz J. Neuron. 2005; 47: 567-579Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (377) Google Scholar). To test this finding, we transfected COS7 cells with constructs of HA-tagged ApoEr2 and GFP-tagged PSD95, incubated cell lysates with anti-HA, and probed the precipitates with anti-GFP (Fig. 4A). PSD95 co-precipitated with the intracellular domain of ApoEr2 (construct 4) and with full-length ApoErR2 (construct 7), but not with the extracellular domains of ApoEr2 (constructs 1, 2, and 3). The expression of the different PSD95 constructs did not affect total levels of ApoEr2 (Fig. 4A). The strong co-precipitation of PSD95 with full-length ApoEr2 but not extracellular domains occurred despite the higher levels of expression of the individual domains, as determined by Western blot analysis with the HA antibody (data not shown). Thus, as hypothesized, PSD95 interacted with the cytoplasmic portion of ApoEr2. To further define which part of the cytoplasmic domain of ApoEr2 interacted with PSD95, we generated several constructs of ApoEr2 containing only exon 18 (Fig. 4B, construct 1), only exon 19 (Fig. 4B, construct 2), or exons 18 and 19 (Fig. 4B, construct 3). We found that PSD95 co-precipitated with exon 19 but not exon 18 of ApoEr2 (Fig. 4C). The PDZ1 Domain of PSD95 Interacts with ApoEr2—We examined which domain of PSD95 interacted with ApoEr2. We generated deletion constructs of PSD95 (Fig. 5A), and co-transfected COS7 cells with deletion constructs (constructs 1-3) or full-length ApoEr2. As expected, we found that full-length PSD95 immunoprecipitated with ApoEr2 (Fig. 5B). However, each PSD95 construct lacking the PDZ1 domain did not co-precipitate with ApoEr2 (Fig. 5B and data not shown). As controls, we confirmed that levels of ApoEr2 were similar in all samples (Fig. 5B, lower panel), and PSD95 constructs 1 and 5 were strongly present in transfected cells (Fig. 5C). The specificity of the co-precipitation of ApoEr2 for only full-length PSD95 again demonstrated that the interaction is not because of overexpression of two proteins in the same cells. We then generated a PSD95 deletion construct containing only the PDZ1 domain (Fig. 5A, construct 4). We co-transfected COS7 cells with PDZ1-GFP and ApoEr2, incubated lysates with anti-GFP, and probed precipitates with anti-HA. ApoEr2 co-precipitated with PSD95 PDZ1 (Fig. 5D). Thus, the PDZ1 domain of PSD95 interacts with ApoEr2, but not the PDZ2 or PDZ3 domains. PSD95 Increases Processing and Levels of Cell Surface ApoEr2—We tested whether the interaction of PSD95 with ApoEr2 affected processing of ApoEr2. For these experiments we co-transfected COS7 cells with ApoEr2 and various PSD95 deletion constructs, and measured the amount of secreted ApoEr2 and ApoEr2 CTF. In four experiments, we found that full-length PSD95 strongly increased secreted ApoEr2 and ApoEr2 CTF (Fig. 6A). We then asked whether the PSD95 PDZ1 domain alone affected ApoEr2 processing. For these experiments we co-transfected COS7 cells with ApoEr2 and PSD95 PDZ1 (construct 4), and measured the amount of secreted ApoEr2 and ApoEr2 CTF. In four experiments, we found that the PDZ1 domain of PSD95 also increased secreted ApoEr2 and ApoEr2 CTF (Fig. 6B). Thus, PSD95 interactions with ApoEr2 promoted the cleavage of ApoEr2. The effects of PSD95 on ApoEr2 cleavage could be explained by increased movement of ApoEr2 to the cell surface. To measure cell surface levels of ApoEr2, we co-transfected COS7 cells with ApoEr2 and PSD95 constructs, biotin-labeled cell surface proteins, isolated biotin-labeled proteins from cell lysates with avidin beads, and immunoblotted ApoEr2. Levels of cell surface ApoEr2 were increased by full-length PSD95, but were unaffected by PSD95 constructs that do not interact with ApoEr2 (Fig. 6C). Levels of total cell-associated ApoEr2 were similar among the transfected cells (Fig. 6C, lower panel). No ApoEr2 signal was observed in the absence of biotinylation in multiple experiments (data not shown). Quantification of multiple experiments demonstrated that levels of cell surface ApoEr2 were significantly increased by 210% by the presence of full-length PSD95 (p < 0.05). We took a second approach to measuring surface levels of ApoEr2. Human embryonic kidney cells were transfected with full-length ApoEr2 and one of several PSD95 constructs. Surface ApoEr2 was detected in live cells using the 5810 antibody (Fig. 6D). The antibody only labeled the plasma membrane and not internal ApoEr2 in the endoplasmic reticulum or Golgi. Visibly greater levels of surface ApoEr2 were observed when ApoEr2 was expressed in the presence of the PSD95 PDZ1 domain (top panel) or full-length PSD95 (bottom panel) compared with the PSD95 construct lacking PDZ1 (middle panel). Thus, again, the PDZ1 domain of PSD95 and full-length PSD95 promoted surface levels of ApoEr2. The PDZ2 Domain of PSD95 Interacts with NR2A and NR2B Subunits— A yeast two-hybrid system showed that NMDAR subunits NR2A and NR2B interact with the PDZ2 domain of PSD95 (25Niethammer M. Kim E. Sheng M. J. Neurosci. 1996; 16: 2157-2163Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). To test these findings in our system, we transfected COS7 cells with GFP-tagged PSD95 constructs and FLAG-tagged NR2 constructs, incubated cell lysates with anti-FLAG, and probed precipitates with anti-GFP. Full-length PSD95 and the deletion construct containing PDZ2 (construct 1) showed interactions with the NR2A subunit (Fig. 7A). We confirmed that expression levels of NR2A were similar across transfections (Fig. 7A, lower panel). Similarly, full-length PSD95 and the deletion construct containing PDZ2 showed interactions with the NR2B subunit (Fig. 7B). NR2B was expressed at similar levels in all transfections (Fig. 7B, bottom panel). These data suggest that PSD95 could be a structural link between the ApoEr2 and NMDA receptor by binding ApoEr2 via PDZ1 and NR2 subunits via PDZ2. Co-precipitation of PSD95 and ApoEr2 Is Affected by Activation of NMDA Receptors or ApoE Receptors—The potential complex of ApoEr2, PSD95, and NMDARs could be altered by binding of agonists and antagonists to extracellular domains of these receptors. We examined whether the interaction between ApoEr2 and PSD95 is dependent on the NMDAR by treating primary neurons with agonist NMDA or NMDAR antagonist MK 801. Cell lysates were incubated with ApoEr2 antibody 5810, and precipitates were probed with anti-PSD95. As in transfected COS7 cells, ApoEr2 and PSD95 from neuronal lysates co-precipitated (Fig. 8A). Surprisingly, we found that both MK 801 and NMDA treatments markedly reduced co-precipitation of PSD95 with ApoEr2 (Fig. 8A). These data suggest that the PSD95-ApoEr2 interaction depends on the activity of the NMDA receptor. We had found that ApoEr2 interacted with NMDA R1 in mouse brain (Fig. 1). We tested whether we could also observe an interaction between ApoEr2 and PSD95 in vivo. Consistent with our in vitro studies, PSD95 co-precipitated with ApoEr2 (Fig. 8A). We then asked whether the interaction between ApoEr2 and PSD95 was altered by ligands that bind ApoEr2. We infused the apoE-derived peptide into the rat dorsal hippocampus and collected brain lysates after 1 week. Correct insertion of the cannula into the hippocampus for each brain was noted at the time of dissection. ApoE peptide treatment increased co-precipitation of PSD95 with ApoEr2 (Fig. 8B). Quantification of Western blots from apoE peptide-infused rat brains demonstrated that ApoEr2/PSD95 co-precipitation was significantly increased by 103% after apoE peptide treatment (p < 0.01). These findings suggest that apoE also could modulate the interaction between ApoEr2 and PSD95, although the precise mechanism of this finding will have to be explored in vivo. In this work, we found that the apoE receptor ApoEr2 interacted with NMDA receptors in two ways: first, ApoEr2 interacted with NR1 subunits through an extracellular interaction (Fig. 2), and second, ApoEr2 interacted with PSD95, potentially forming a link with NR2 subunits (Fig. 4). The cytoplasmic domain of ApoEr2 interacted with the first PDZ domain of PSD95 (Fig. 5), whereas NR2 subunits interacted with the second PDZ domain (Fig. 7). The interactions with NR2 subunits and PSD95 also affected the processing and trafficking of ApoEr2 (Figs. 3 and 6), increasing the surface levels and cleavage of ApoEr2. Finally, binding of ligands to ApoEr2 or NMDA receptors altered the co-precipitation of PSD95 with ApoEr2 (Fig. 8). These data suggest that the conformations of NMDA receptors and ApoEr2 may be important for promoting or inhibiting the interaction of ApoEr2 with PSD95. These results are consistent with numerous studies that demonstrated that apoE receptors affect neuronal calcium influx via NMDA receptors. Studies from several groups have demonstrated that apoE receptors affect kinase signaling cascades by affecting calcium influx (5Qui Z. Crutcher K.A. Hyman B.T. Rebeck G.W. Neuroscience. 2003; 122: 291-303Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar, 7Hoe H.S. Harris D.C. Rebeck G.W. J. Neurochem. 2005; 93: 145-155Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar, 24Beffert U.

Another study showed a direct effect of apoE receptors on calcium influx via NMDA receptors (4Bacskai B.J. Xia M.Q. Strickland D.K. Rebeck G.W. Hyman B.T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 11551-11556Crossref PubMed Scopus (172) Google Scholar). Other studies found that ApoEr2 affected LTP (11Weeber E.J. Beffert U. Jones C. Christian J.M. Forster E. Sweatt J.D. Herz J. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 39944-39952Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (513) Google Scholar). Most recently, ApoEr2 was found in the post-synaptic densities, and shown to form complexes with NR2A and PSD95; these complexes depended on the alternatively spliced cytoplasmic exon that we also identified in this work (24Beffert U. Weeber E.J. Durudas A. Qiu S. Masiulis I. Sweatt J.D. Li W.P. Adelmann G. Frotscher M. Hammer R.E. Herz J. Neuron. 2005; 47: 567-579Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (377) Google Scholar). Interestingly, this exon also was important for proper LTP and memory functions in transgenic mice (24Beffert U. Weeber E.J. Durudas A. Qiu S. Masiulis I. Sweatt J.D. Li W.P. Adelmann G. Frotscher M. Hammer R.E. Herz J. Neuron. 2005; 47: 567-579Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (377) Google Scholar). The physical interactions between ApoEr2 and NMDA receptor subunits reported here will need to be analyzed by other techniques in vitro and in vivo to determine whether there are changes in protein trafficking or receptor localization in synapses. We previously reported that apoE receptor processing could be promoted by the presence of extracellular ligands (8Hoe H.S. Rebeck G.W. Brain Res. Mol. Brain Res. 2005; 137: 31-39Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). Here we have found that the presence of NMDA receptor subunits could also promote the cleavage of ApoEr2 (Figs. 3 and 6). The cleavage of apoE receptors could be important for the release of the intracellular domain of the receptor, allowing associated proteins to move from the membrane to the cytoplasm (20Hoe H.S. Wessner D. Beffert U. Becker A.G. Matsuoka Y. Rebeck G.W. Mol. Cell Biol. 2005; 25: 9259-9268Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar). The cleavage could also be important for the cessation of signaling via apoE receptors, and thus be influenced by the presence of NMDA receptors. From these data we have generated a model of ApoEr2 affecting NMDA receptor function through both intracellular and extracellular interactions (Fig. 9). ApoEr2 could bind to NR1 through its extracellular domain, although we could not define a subdomain of ApoEr2 that mediated this interaction. It is possible that some ApoEr2 constructs affect NMDAR1 trafficking and thus its interaction with ApoEr2; further work will explore the potential extracellular interactions. Intracellularly, ApoEr2 binds PSD95 via its PDZ1 domain, forming a link to NR2 subunits, which bind to the PSD95 PDZ2 domain. Previous studies have demonstrated that NR2 proteins bind PSD95 through their extreme C-terminal amino acids (25Niethammer M. Kim E. Sheng M. J. Neurosci. 1996; 16: 2157-2163Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). However, ApoEr2 interacts with PSD95 through a cytoplasmic domain that is not the C terminus (Fig. 4 and Ref. 24Beffert U. Weeber E.J. Durudas A. Qiu S. Masiulis I. Sweatt J.D. Li W.P. Adelmann G. Frotscher M. Hammer R.E. Herz J. Neuron. 2005; 47: 567-579Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (377) Google Scholar). Interestingly, this domain of ApoEr2 is alternatively spliced, so some forms of ApoEr2 bind PSD95 and some forms do not. PSD95 binding to ApoEr2 also increases the presence of ApoEr2 on the cell surface, promoting cleavage of its extracellular domain. Thus, binding of PSD95 to ApoEr2 affects the interaction of ApoEr2 with NMDA receptors and its proteolysis. ApoE receptors interact with various adaptor proteins, such as disabled and PSD95, which affect their trafficking and processing. These events naturally alter the metabolism of apoE. Understanding the functions of these receptors and the molecules with which they interact aids in our understanding of the functions of apoE, and how it may affect the risk of Alzheimer disease. We have demonstrated a close physical connection between ApoEr2 and NMDA receptors in cells, raising the possibility that apoE isoforms directly affect NMDA receptor activity and molecular mechanisms of memory. We thank Dr. Barry Wolfe for NMDA receptor antibodies and useful discussions. We thank Dr. George Augustine (Duke University) for helpful discussions and advice. We thank Dr. David Bredt for the PSD95 construct and Dr. Uwe Beffert for the anti-ApoEr2 antibody."
https://openalex.org/W2068890508,"Breast tumors are usually classified according to their response to estrogens as hormone-dependent or -independent. In this work, we investigated the role of the proinflammatory cytokine TNF-alpha on the estrogen-receptor-positive T47D breast ductal tumor cells. We have found that TNF-alpha exerts a mitogenic effect, inducing cyclin D1 expression and activation of the transcription factor NF-kappaB. Importantly, activation of NF-kappaB was required for estrogen-induced proliferation and cyclin D1 expression. TNF-alpha enhanced the estrogen response by increasing the levels and availability of NF-kappaB. Chromatin immunoprecipitation analysis suggested that the action of estrogens is mediated by a protein complex that contains the activated estrogen receptor, the nuclear receptor coactivator RAC3 and a member of the NF-kappaB family. Finally, our results demonstrate that activation of this transcription factor could be one of the key signals for estrogen-mediated response."

The etiology of PD is still unknown, but recent identification of mutations in familial cases of PD has advanced the understanding of the molecular mechanisms of this neurological disease. Mutations in the parkin gene, which encodes for ubiquitin-protein ligase (E3), have been implicated in autosomal recessive juvenile Parkinsonism, an early onset and common familial form of PD. Here we reported that Parkin selectively binds to RanBP2, which is localized in the cytoplasmic filament of the nuclear pore complex and belongs to the small ubiquitin-related modifier E3 ligase family. We also demonstrated that RanBP2 becomes a target for Parkin E3 ubiquitin-ligase and is processed via Parkin-mediated ubiquitination and subsequent proteasomal degradation. Furthermore, Parkin controls the intracellular levels of sumoylated HDAC4, as a result of the ubiquitination and degradation of RanBP2. Our findings suggested that the intracellular levels of RanBP2 and its functional activity may be modulated by Parkin-mediated ubiquitination and proteasomal pathways.

The etiology of PD remains poorly understood, but several genetic loci have been implicated in the pathogenesis of familial forms of PD. First, two missense mutations of α-synuclein have been linked to a rare dominant form of PD (5Polymeropoulos M.H. Lavedan C. Leroy E. Ide S.E. Dehejia A. Dutra A. Pike B. Root H. Rubenstein J.

Second, parkin has been identified as the causative gene of early onset autosomal recessive juvenile parkinsonism (AR-JP) (6Kitada T. Asakawa S. Hattori N. Matsumine H. Yamamura Y. Minoshima S. Yokochi M. Mizuno Y. Shimizu N. Nature. 1998; 392: 605-608Crossref PubMed Scopus (4092) Google Scholar), and a missense mutation in the ubiquitin (Ub) C-terminal hydrolase L1 appears to be responsible for a dominant form of PD (7Lincoln S.

The structure of Parkin contains a C-terminal RING-IBR-RING motif and an N-terminal region with homology to ubiquitin (10Imai Y. Soda M. Takahashi R. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 75: 35661-35664Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (645) Google Scholar, 11Shimura H. Hattori N. Kubo S. Mizuno Y. Asakawa S. Minoshima S. Shimizu N. Iwai K. Chiba T. Tanaka K.

A. 2000; 97: 13354-13359Crossref PubMed Scopus (826) Google Scholar). Proteins destined to degrade in the proteasomes are subject to covalent modification by ubiquitin as a small protein tag. Ubiquitination proceeds through a sequential enzymatic reaction composed of ubiquitin-activating enzyme (E1), ubiquitin-conjugating enzyme (E2), and ubiquitin-protein ligase (E3) (13Hershko A. Ciechanover A. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1998; 67: 425-479Crossref PubMed Scopus (6736) Google Scholar). Based on the previous findings that numerous proteins with RING finger motifs have E3 ubiquitin-ligase activity, several studies have revealed that Parkin has an ubiquitin E3 ligase activity. The exquisite specificity for the proteins to be ubiquitinated is usually determined by a diverse family of E3s with a specific E2. Based on the functional role of Parkin, it can be surmised that the loss of Parkin results in the gradual and abnormal accumulation of Parkin substrates, which might then induce a familial PD syndrome. Several substrates of Parkin have been reported to date, including cell division control-related protein-1 (CDCrel-1; Ref. 13Hershko A. Ciechanover A. Annu. Rev.

Here we attempted to identify the new binding targets of Parkin by using yeast two-hybrid assay. As the result of screening human fetal cDNA library, RanBP2 was identified to bind selectively to Parkin. Using co-immunoprecipitation, in vitro GST pull-down assay, and immunocytochemical analysis, we detected the occurrence of specific interactions between Parkin and RanBP2 in mammalian neuronal systems as well as in non-neuronal cells. In addition, RanBP2 was shown to become a substrate of Parkin E3 ubiquitin ligase and to be subsequently processed via the proteasomal machinery. Materials and cDNA Constructs—Synthetic dropout medium and yeast extract peptone dextrose containing adenine were purchased from Qbiogene (Carlsbad, CA). 3-Amino-1,2,4-triazole was from Sigma, and the human fetal brain cDNA library was from Clontech. Peroxidase-conjugated anti-rabbit and anti-mouse immunoglobulins were from Zymed Laboratories Inc.. Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium, fetal bovine serum, and cell culture reagents were from Invitrogen. Protein A-Sepharose was from Amersham Biosciences, and enhanced chemiluminescence (ECL) reagents were obtained from PerkinElmer Life Sciences. Polyclonal and monoclonal anti-HA, anti-GFP, anti-GST, and anti-RanBP2 antibodies were from Santa Cruz Biotechnology (Santa Cruz, CA); anti-FLAG antibody was from Sigma, and polyclonal anti-Parkin antibodies were from cell signaling and Chemicon. Clasto-lactacystin β-lactone was purchased from A. G. Scientific (San Diego), and calpeptin was from Calbiochem. Mammalian expression vector encoding for FLAG-tagged Parkin was kindly provided by G. Lee (Ajou University, Suwon, Korea). Plasmids encoding for bacterial recombinant GST fused with wild type and deleted Parkin mutants (77-465 and 1-170) and mammalian expression vectors encoding GFP-tagged wild type Parkin were gifts from H. Rhim (The Catholic University, Seoul, Korea). Plasmids encoding for recombinant GST-tagged deletion mutants of human RanBP2, such as containing the amino acids 2596-2836 (GST-IR) and 2633-2761 (GST-IR1 + 2), and pEGFP-Cl vector for GFP-tagged IR1 + 2 were provided by H. Saitoh (Kyushu University, Fukuoka, Japan). Mammalian expression vectors for HA-tagged SUMO-1 and GFP- and FLAG-tagged HDAC4 were provided by A. Dejean (Institut Pasteur, Paris, France). Plasmid encoding His-tagged Nedd4-2 was provided by P. Snyder (University of Iowa, Iowa City). Yeast Two-hybrid Assay—The bait vector for yeast two-hybrid assay was constructed by subcloning the wild type Parkin cDNA into the pHybTrp/Zeo vector. The human fetal cDNA library subcloned into the prey vector, pACT2, was purchased from Clontech. The yeast strain L40, harboring the reporter genes lacZ and HIS3 downstream of the LexA promoter, was sequentially transformed with bait vector followed by cDNA library vectors and then plated on a synthetic medium containing 5 mm 3-amino-1,2,4-triazole and lacking histidine, leucine, and tryptophan residues. After incubating the plates for 10-14 days at 30 °C, the transformants were tested with a synthetic medium that lacked histidine, leucine, and tryptophan residues and contained 50 μg/ml 5-bromo-4-chloro-3-indoryl-d-galactoside. After incubation for 2-3 days at 30 °C, the blue yeast colonies were selected as positive clones. The positive clone plasmids were extracted from yeast in lysis buffer containing 2% Triton X-100, 1% SDS, 100 mm NaCl, 10 mm Tris, pH 8.0, and 1.0 mm EDTA and then transformed into E. coli DH5α via electroporation. Sequences of the inserts in positive library plasmids were analyzed with an automatic DNA sequencer (ALF express, Amersham Biosciences). Cell Culture and Preparation of Cell Lysates—Human embryonic kidney 293 (HEK293) cells and dopaminergic neuroblastoma SH-SY5Y cells were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 10% fetal bovine serum and 100 units/ml penicillin/streptomycin. To prepare cell lysates, the cells were rinsed twice with ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline and solubilized in lysis buffer (20 mm Tris, pH 7.9, containing 1.0% Triton X-100, 1 mm Na3VO4, 137 mm NaCl, 1 μg/ml leupeptin, 1 μg/ml aprotinin, 1 mm sodium orthovanadate, 1 mm EGTA, 10 mm NaF,1 mm tetrasodium pyrophosphate, 5 mm Na2EDTA, 10% glycerol, 1 mm β-glycerophosphate, 0.1 g/ml p-nitrophenyl phosphate, and 0.2 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride). The cells were scraped, and the supernatants were collected after 10 min of centrifugation at 14,000 × g and 4 °C. Protein concentrations were determined using the detergent-compatible protein assay kit (Bio Rad). Immunoprecipitation and Western Blot Analysis—One microgram of antibodies was incubated with 1 mg of cell extracts prepared in lysis buffer overnight at 4 °C. Thirty microliters of a 1:1 suspension of protein A-Sepharose beads was added and incubated for 2 h at 4°C with gentle rotation. The beads were pelleted and washed five times with cell lysis buffer. Bound proteins were dissociated by boiling in SDS-PAGE sample buffer, and whole protein samples were separated on SDS-polyacrylamide gel, and then transferred to a nitrocellulose membrane (Millipore, Japan). The membrane was blocked in TBST buffer containing 20 mm Tris, pH 7.6, 137 mm NaCl, 0.05% Tween 20, and 5% nonfat dry milk for 1 h and then incubated overnight at 4 °C in 3% nonfat dry milk containing antibodies. The membrane was washed several times in TBST, and then incubated with secondary IgG-coupled horseradish peroxidase antibody (Zymed Laboratories Inc.). After 60 min, blots were washed several times with TBST and were visualized by ECL. RNA Interference—The matched and nonsilencing siRNAs of RanBP2 were generated as described previously (22Joseph J. Liu S.T. Jablonski S.A. Yen T.J. Dasso M. Curr. Biol. 2003; 14: 611-617Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (221) Google Scholar). The target cells were transfected with the annealed double-strand RNA oligonucleotides (PROLIGO Primer & Probes, Boulder, CO) using Lipofectamine (Invitrogen) at a final concentration of 100 nm. In Vitro Ubiquitination Assay—Fifty microliters of in vitro ubiquitination reaction contained reaction buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.6, 5 mm MgCl2, 2 mm ATP, 2 mm dithiothreitol), 10 μg of recombinant ubiquitin, 100 ng of E1 (Calbiochem), 200 ng of UbcH7 (Sigma), and 500 ng of GST-IR as a substrate. The reaction was performed via the addition of either Myc-tagged Parkin or its deleted mutants produced by TnT quick-coupled transcription/translation systems (Promega) for 2 h at 37 °C and terminated by mixing with an equal volume of 2× SDS sample buffer. The reaction products were subjected to Western blot analysis and were analyzed with anti-GST or anti-ubiquitin antibodies (Santa Cruz Biotechnology). Yeast Two-hybrid Assay for the Identification of New Parkin E3 Ubiquitin Ligase Substrate(s)—To identify the new Parkin-binding partner(s), we performed yeast two-hybrid assay by using full-length wild type Parkin as bait. After screening human fetal brain cDNA library, several previously known and novel proteins were identified to interact with Parkin, including cyclin E, β-tubulin, and RanBP2 (data not shown). Among these, RanBP2 is a component of cytoplasmic filaments in the nuclear pore complex (23Fried H. Kutay H. Cell. Mol. Life Sci. 2003; 60: 1659-1688Crossref PubMed Scopus (402) Google Scholar). Nuclear pore complex traverses the nuclear envelope, providing a channel through which nucleocytoplasmic transport occurs. RanBP2 is thought to play an important role in CRM1-mediated nuclear protein export (24Bernad R. van der Velde H. Fornerod M. Pickersgill H. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2004; 24: 2373-2384Crossref PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar). In addition, RanBP2 is known to function as a SUMO E3 ligase (25Saitoh H. Pizzi M.D. Wang J. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 4755-4763Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). To determine whether RanBP2 might be a new ubiquitination target of Parkin, and/or whether the potential binding between these two proteins might alter the functional activity of Parkin, RanBP2 was chosen as a target for further analysis. Parkin Interacts with RanBP2 in Vivo and in Vitro—First, we attempted to determine whether Parkin selectively binds to RanBP2 in mammalian cells. After eukaryotic expression plasmid encoding FLAG-tagged human wild type Parkin was transiently transfected into HEK293 cells, and the cell lysates were prepared, immunoprecipitated with anti-RanBP2 antibodies, and subsequently immunoblotted with anti-FLAG IgG. As shown in Fig. 1A, the transfected FLAG-tagged Parkin was able to bind to endogenous RanBP2 in the HEK293 cells. When co-immunoprecipitation was performed in reverse with anti-FLAG antibodies, followed by immunoblot analysis with anti-RanBP2 IgGs, the results was the same. This indicates that FLAG-Parkin binds well to RanBP2 (Fig. 1A). We next examined whether this specific association between Parkin and RanBP2 was also present in human dopaminergic neuroblastoma (SH-SY5Y) cell lines. After eukaryotic expression plasmid encoding FLAG-tagged Parkin was transfected into the SH-SY5Y cells (Fig. 1B), the immunoprecipitation was performed with either anti-RanBP2 or anti-FLAG antibodies. As shown in Fig. 1B, Parkin selectively binds to endogenous RanBP2. When the same co-immunoprecipitation assay was performed in the neuroblastoma SK-N-BE2C cell line, the specific interaction between RanBP2 and Parkin was also observed (data not shown). These results suggest that the specific binding of Parkin to RanBP2 occurs in mammalian cells. To characterize further the interactions between Parkin and RanBP2, SH-SY5Y cells were cultured on glass coverslips and transfected with GFP-Parkin. The expression of GFP-Parkin proteins was visualized by using a confocal microscope. Immunofluorescence analysis of endogenous RanBP2 was carried out with anti-RanBP2 IgG and then rhodamine-conjugated secondary antibodies. As shown in Fig. 2C, the co-localization of RanBP2 and GFP-Parkin was observed (Fig. 1C). To confirm the specific interaction between Parkin and RanBP2 and to identify the interaction site, an in vitro GST pull-down assay was performed by using recombinant GST-Parkin fusion protein (Fig. 1D). To confirm the proper expression and purification of GST-Parkin and its mutants, Western blotting was performed with anti-GST IgG and two anti-Parkin antibodies; one is specific for amino acid residues 83-97 of the human Parkin N terminus, and the other is specific for several residues around the C-terminal 400th amino acid of Parkin. After HEK293 cell extracts were incubated with GST fused either with wild type Parkin or its deleted mutants (amino acids 77-465 or 1-170), immunoprecipitation was carried out with anti-RanBP2 antibodies, followed by immunoblot analysis with either anti-GST antibodies. As shown in Fig. 1D, both wild type and deleted mutant Parkin fused with GST were co-immunoprecipitated with endogenous RanBP2. When used as a negative control, GST alone was determined not to interact with RanBP2. The Parkin fragment spanning its 78-170th amino acid fused with GST was shown to interact with RanBP2 (Fig. 1E). In addition, an excess amount of GST-Parkin peptide (amino acids 78-170) blocked the binding of RanBP2 to Parkin (Fig. 1E). These data indicated that Parkin directly binds to RanBP2 in vitro as well as in vivo, and the region spanning amino acid residues 78-170 appears to be important for its binding to RanBP2. We next attempted to determine whether the specific association between Parkin and RanBP2, which had been encountered in both in vitro and in cell-based assays, was also present in mammalian neural tissues of the central nervous system. After the rat and mouse brain cortex were isolated and homogenized, Western blot analysis revealed that significant levels of Parkin are present (Fig. 1F, left). The cell extracts were then immunoprecipitated with anti-RanBP2 antibodies, followed by the immunoblot analysis with either anti-Parkin or anti-RanBP2 antibodies. As shown in Fig. 1F, Parkin selectively associated with RanBP2. As a control, the analysis of immunocomplexes prepared with preimmune IgG revealed that there is no obvious Parkin band for interaction with RanBP2 (Fig. 1F). The same interaction between Parkin and RanBP2 was also observed in the extracts from other brain tissues, such as the hippocampus and midbrain (data not shown). Parkin Interacts with the IR1 + 2 Domain of RanBP2—To verify further this binding and to map the binding domain within the RanBP2, plasmids encoding for FLAG-tagged Parkin were co-transfected into HEK293 cells with a construct designed for the expression of GFP-tagged RanBP2 deletion mutant (IR1 + 2), spanning amino acids 2633-2761 of RanBP2, followed by immunoprecipitation with either anti-FLAG or anti-GFP antibodies, respectively. The IR1 + 2 region was shown previously to bind to the SUMO-conjugating E2 enzyme, Ubc9, and to possess the SUMO-E3 ligase activity of RanBP2 (25Saitoh H. Pizzi M.D. Wang J. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 4755-4763Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar, 26Kirsh O. Seeler J.S. Pichler A. Gast A. Muller S. Miska E. Mathieu M. HarelBellan A. Kouzarides T. Melchior F. Dejean A. EMBO J. 2002; 21: 2682-2691Crossref PubMed Scopus (263) Google Scholar, 27Pichler A. Gast A. Seeler J.S. Dejean A. Melchior F. Cell. 2002; 108: 109-120Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (631) Google Scholar). As shown in Fig. 2A, Western blot analysis of the immunocomplexes with either anti-GFP or anti-FLAG antibodies demonstrated that Parkin binds to IR1 + 2. In addition, the incubation of excess recombinant IR1 + 2 proteins, as a blocking peptide, resulted in the inhibition of Parkin binding to IR1 + 2 (Fig. 2A). Furthermore, when the plasmid encoding unrelated FLAG-GAdd45γ or intact GFP was used as a negative control, they did not bind to GFP-IR1 + 2 or FLAG-Parkin, respectively (Fig. 2B). The binding between Parkin and IR1 + 2 domain was also observed in murine dopaminergic MN9D cells (Fig. 2C). In addition, the immunohistochemical analysis was performed to examine whether Parkin is co-localized with IR1 + 2. After SH-SY5Y cells were co-transfected with plasmids encoding for Myc-tagged Parkin plus GFP-tagged IR1 + 2, the cells were labeled with anti-Parkin antibodies, followed by staining with rhodamine-attached secondary antibodies. As shown in Fig. 2C, fluorescence microscopic observation indicated that the localization of IR1 + 2 expression is coincident with that of Parkin within the nucleus. These data indicate that IR1 + 2 domain of RanBP2 specifically interacts with Parkin. Parkin Promotes the Ubiquitination of RanBP2 and Its Degradation via Ubiquitin-Proteasome System (UPS) Pathway—To determine the functional relevance of the mutual interaction between Parkin and RanBP2, we attempted to ascertain whether RanBP2 could function as a substrate of Parkin E3 ubiquitin ligase. To evaluate whether Parkin could mediate the degradation of RanBP2 via the UPS, we first measured the effects of Parkin overexpression on the endogenous levels of RanBP2. After the transient transfection of plasmid encoding for FLAG-Parkin into HEK293 cells, cell lysates were prepared, and Western blot analysis was performed with anti-RanBP2 or anti-FLAG antibodies. As shown in Fig. 3A, Parkin was properly expressed inside the cells after its transient transfection, and a significant decrease in RanBP2 protein levels was detected after 48 h in the cells exhibiting Parkin overexpression, as compared with control cells transfected with vehicle only (Fig. 3A, right). These findings suggest that Parkin may either promote the degradation of and/or block the synthesis of RanBP2. To ensure that this Parkin-mediated reduction in endogenous RanBP2 levels was not an event specific to the HEK293 cells, the same experiment was conducted in SH-SY5Y cells and H19-7 cells. Just as seen in the HEK293 cells, the endogenous RanBP2 protein levels also decreased after 36 and 48 h of post-transfection with Parkin plasmid in the SH-SY5Y cells (Fig. 3A, left) and H19-7 cells (data not shown), indicating that Parkin overexpression results in the down-regulation of intracellular RanBP2. In addition, we tested whether the dominant-negative Parkin mutant containing the 77-465-amino acid domain affects the Parkin-mediated reduction in RanBP2 levels. When the plasmid encoding the functionally defective Parkin mutant was transfected into SH-SY5Y cells, the endogenous RanBP2 levels were not significantly changed, as compared with mock-transfected cells (Fig. 3B). Therefore, this result indicated that the E3 ubiquitin ligase activity of Parkin was required for the reduction of endogenous RanBP2 levels. To determine whether Parkin-mediated RanBP2 degradation occurred via the UPS pathway, the endogenous levels of RanBP2 in the cells transiently transfected with FLAG-Parkin were measured and compared in the absence or presence of clasto-lactacystin β-lactone (lactacystin), the highly specific proteasomal proteolysis inhibitor. Based on our previous report (17Kim S.J. Sung J.Y. Um J.W. Hattori N. Mizuno Y. Tanaka K. Paik S.R. Kim J. Chung K.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 41890-41899Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar), in which Parkin was shown to cleave intracellular α-synuclein inclusions via calpain activation, we also tested the effect of the calpain inhibitor, calpeptin, to confirm the involvement of calpain in the Parkin-mediated degradation of RanBP2. When SH-SY5Y cells were transiently transfected with Parkin, followed by the stimulation of lactacystin, the reduction of endogenous RanBP2 levels was remarkably blocked, as compared with the control cells that were not treated with lactacystin. In contrast, we witnessed no significant effects on the recovery of the reduced RanBP2 levels as a result of pretreatment with calpeptin (Fig. 3C). These results indicated that Parkin promotes RanBP2 degradation, which appears to be mediated somewhat by the activation of proteasome-dependent proteolytic machinery, but not through calpain activation. Moreover, the same results were observed in the cells treated with other proteasome inhibitors, such as MG132 and epoxomycin (Fig. 3C). The observation that RanBP2 expressed in cultured cells is liable to be digested through the proteasomal system and its degradation is facilitated by Parkin prompted us to examine whether RanBP2 can be covalently modified by ubiquitin via the action of Parkin. After HEK293 cells were transfected with eukaryotic expression plasmids for either FLAG-tagged ubiquitin plus GFP-tagged IR1 + 2 alone or together with Myc-Parkin as indicated, the cells were untreated or treated with lactacystin. The cell lysates were immunoprecipitated with anti-FLAG or anti-GFP antibodies, followed by immunoblot analysis with anti-GFP or anti-FLAG IgG. As shown in Fig. 4, the pretreatment of lactacystin accelerated the ubiquitination of IR1 + 2 in the cells transfected with Parkin, compared with control cells. These results indicated that RanBP2 becomes a target of Parkin E3 ubiquitin ligase, and its levels are regulated by Parkin and the proteasomal complex system. Parkin Ubiquitinates RanBP2 in Vitro—Using in vitro ubiquitination assay, we attempted to determine whether Parkin could directly ubiquitinate RanBP2. To reconstitute the ubiquitin-conjugation-ligation reaction, in vitro translated wild type Parkin or its deleted mutants (amino acids 77-465, 1-415, and 217-465) were added to reaction mixtures containing recombinant ubiquitin, E1, and E2. It has been reported that the E3 ubiquitin ligase activity of these mutants is absent (11Shimura H. Hattori N. Kubo S. Mizuno Y. Asakawa S. Minoshima S. Shimizu N. Iwai K. Chiba T. Tanaka K. Suzuki T. Nat. Genet. 2000; 25: 302-305Crossref PubMed Scopus (1672) Google Scholar). Because the intact RanBP2 is too large (∼358 kDa) to detect further processing, such as into polyubiquitination, the recombinant-deletion RanBP2 mutant fused with GST (GST-RanBP2-IR), spanning amino acids 2596-2836 of RanBP2 and possessing the full SUMO-E3 ligase activity (26Kirsh O. Seeler J.S. Pichler A. Gast A. Muller S. Miska E. Mathieu M. HarelBellan A. Kouzarides T. Melchior F. Dejean A"
https://openalex.org/W2037134390,"O-Glycosylation and phosphorylation of Sp1 are thought to modulate the expression of a number of genes in normal and diabetic state. Sp1 is an obligatory transcription factor for constitutive and insulin-responsive expression of the calmodulin gene (Majumdar, G., Harmon, A., Candelaria, R., Martinez-Hernandez, A., Raghow, R., and Solomon, S. S. (2003) Am. J. Physiol. 285, E584-E591). Here we report the temporal dynamics of accumulation of total, O-GlcNAc-modified, and phosphorylated Sp1 in H-411E hepatoma cells by immunohistochemistry with monospecific antibodies, confocal microscopy, and matrix-assisted laser desorption and ionization-time of flight mass spectrometry. Insulin elicited sequential and reciprocal post-translational modifications of Sp1. The O-glycosylation of Sp1 and its nuclear accumulation induced by insulin peaked early (∼30 min), followed by a steady decline of O-GlcNAc-modified Sp1 to negligible levels by 240 min. The accumulation of phosphorylated Sp1 in the nuclei of insulin-treated cells showed an opposite pattern, increasing steadily until reaching a maximum around 240 min after treatment. Analyses of the total, O-GlcNAc-modified, or phosphorylated Sp1 by Western blot and mass spectrometry corroborated the sequential and reciprocal control of post-translational modifications of Sp1 in response to insulin. Treatment of cells with streptozotocin (a potent inhibitor of O-GlcNAcase) led to hyperglycosylation of Sp1 that failed to be significantly phosphorylated. The mass spectrometry data indicated that a number of common serine residues of Sp1 undergo time-dependent, reciprocal O-glycosylation and phosphorylation, paralleling its rapid translocation from cytoplasm to the nucleus. Later, changes in the steady state levels of phosphorylated Sp1 mimicked the enhanced steady state levels of calmodulin mRNA seen after insulin treatment. Thus, O-glycosylation of Sp1 appears to be critical for its localization into the nucleus, where it undergoes obligatory phosphorylation that is needed for Sp1 to activate calmodulin gene expression. O-Glycosylation and phosphorylation of Sp1 are thought to modulate the expression of a number of genes in normal and diabetic state. Sp1 is an obligatory transcription factor for constitutive and insulin-responsive expression of the calmodulin gene (Majumdar, G., Harmon, A., Candelaria, R., Martinez-Hernandez, A., Raghow, R., and Solomon, S. S. (2003) Am. J. Physiol. 285, E584-E591). Here we report the temporal dynamics of accumulation of total, O-GlcNAc-modified, and phosphorylated Sp1 in H-411E hepatoma cells by immunohistochemistry with monospecific antibodies, confocal microscopy, and matrix-assisted laser desorption and ionization-time of flight mass spectrometry. Insulin elicited sequential and reciprocal post-translational modifications of Sp1. The O-glycosylation of Sp1 and its nuclear accumulation induced by insulin peaked early (∼30 min), followed by a steady decline of O-GlcNAc-modified Sp1 to negligible levels by 240 min. The accumulation of phosphorylated Sp1 in the nuclei of insulin-treated cells showed an opposite pattern, increasing steadily until reaching a maximum around 240 min after treatment. Analyses of the total, O-GlcNAc-modified, or phosphorylated Sp1 by Western blot and mass spectrometry corroborated the sequential and reciprocal control of post-translational modifications of Sp1 in response to insulin. Treatment of cells with streptozotocin (a potent inhibitor of O-GlcNAcase) led to hyperglycosylation of Sp1 that failed to be significantly phosphorylated. The mass spectrometry data indicated that a number of common serine residues of Sp1 undergo time-dependent, reciprocal O-glycosylation and phosphorylation, paralleling its rapid translocation from cytoplasm to the nucleus. Later, changes in the steady state levels of phosphorylated Sp1 mimicked the enhanced steady state levels of calmodulin mRNA seen after insulin treatment. Thus, O-glycosylation of Sp1 appears to be critical for its localization into the nucleus, where it undergoes obligatory phosphorylation that is needed for Sp1 to activate calmodulin gene expression. Diabetes mellitus is a disease of absolute (type I diabetes) or relative (type II diabetes) insulin deficiency. Insulin signaling is initiated by its binding to the plasma membrane receptor, triggering appropriate second messengers, which ultimately result in reprogramming of gene expression in the nucleus (1White M.F. Kahn C.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 1-4PubMed Google Scholar, 2Solomon S.S. Raghow R. Recent Res. Dev. Endocrinol. 2002; 3: 79-99Google Scholar). Insulin-mediated signal transduction leads to post-translational modification of numerous cytoplasmic and nuclear proteins, including transcription factors; O-glycosylation and phosphorylation are the two most prominent post-translational modifications induced by insulin (2Solomon S.S.

Furthermore, we have shown that insulin regulates Sp1 at least at two different levels; insulin stimulates the biosynthesis of Sp1 and also regulates both its O-glycosylation and phosphorylation (6Solomon S.S.

Physiol. 2003; 285: E584-E591Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). We have previously reported that insulin stimulates the production of Sp1. Therefore, our data are consistent with the scenario that insulin-mediated O-GlcNAcylation of Sp1 facilitates its migration to the nucleus, where Sp1 is sequentially deglycosylated and then phosphorylated (7Majumdar G. Wright J. Markowitz P. Martinez-Hernandez A. Raghow R. Solomon S.S. Diabetes. 2004; 53: 3184-3192Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar, 8Majumdar G. Harmon A. Candelaria R. Martinez-Hernandez A.

O-GlcNAcylation of a wide variety of cellular proteins, including signaling molecules and transcription factors, is emerging as an important post-translational modification potentially involved in many regulatory mechanisms of eukaryotic cells (8Majumdar G.

We originally reported that O-glycosylation of Sp1 was essential for insulin-stimulated CaM gene expression (7Majumdar G. Wright J. Markowitz P. Martinez-Hernandez A. Raghow R. Solomon S.S. Diabetes. 2004; 53: 3184-3192Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar, 8Majumdar G. Harmon A. Candelaria R. Martinez-Hernandez A. Raghow R. Solomon S.S. Am. J. Physiol. 2003; 285: E584-E591Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). Similarly, others have shown that O-glycosylation of Sp1 was necessary for argininosuccinate synthetase gene expression in response to glutamine (13Brasse-Lagnel C. Fairand A. Lavoinne A. Husson A.

Biol. 2004; 24: 1680-1690Crossref PubMed Scopus (323) Google Scholar) recently demonstrated that the Ogt gene, which encodes the enzyme O-GlcNAc transferase (OGT), is responsible for the formation of O-GlcNAc-Sp1; inactivation of a functional OGT led to a concomitant decline in O-GlcNAc-modified Sp1 and an increased accumulation of phosphorylated Sp1. Based on these and a number of other observations, it has been postulated that a balance between O-glycosylation and phosphorylation may be an important regulatory mechanism for some proteins (9Comer F.I.

With an objective to define the regulatory dynamics of insulin that enhances both the biosynthesis and posttranslational modification of Sp1, we compared temporal changes in the subcellular distribution of O-glycosylated and phosphorylated Sp1. We used fluorochrome-tagged secondary antibodies to label Sp1-, phosphorylated serine-, and O-GlcNAc-specific primary antibodies and visualized changes in subcellular distribution of Sp1 in response to insulin by confocal microscopy. The dynamics of total, O-GlcNAc-modified, and phosphorylated Sp1 as elucidated by confocal microscopy were also quantified by Western blot analysis. Finally, we corroborated the insulin-induced sequential and reciprocal changes in the two posttranslational modifications of Sp1 by MALDI-TOF mass spectrometry. We report that these sequential changes in O-GlcNAcylation and phosphorylation of Sp1 in response to insulin are mechanistically related to its ability to stimulate CaM gene transcription. Chemicals—Insulin, protein standards, nuclear isolation kit, and streptozotocin (STZ) were purchased from Sigma. Protease inhibitors were purchased from Roche Applied Science. Rabbit polyclonal anti-Sp1 antibody was obtained from Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc. (Santa Cruz, CA). Mouse monoclonal anti-O-linked GlcNAc antibody was obtained from Affinity BioReagents (Golden, CO). Anti-phosphoserine monoclonal antibody was obtained from Sigma. This antibody is highly specific for phosphorylated serine, since it did not react with free serine, nonphosphorylated serine, phosphorylated tyrosine, phosphorylated threonine, ATP, or AMP, as judged by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. The phosphoserine-specific antibody has a high titer against phosphoserine/bovine serum albumin, and we were able to use it routinely at a 1:1000 dilution for Western blots. The anti-phosphoserine antibody has been used by many investigators, and its specificity is well documented in the literature (17Murphy P.R. Limoges M. Dodd F. Boudreau R.T. Too C.K. Endocrinology. 2001; 142: 81-88Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar, 18Zhao M. Eaton J.W. Brunk U.T. FEBS Lett. 2001; 509: 405-412Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). Protein A-Sepharose, SYPRO, Bio-Rad protein assay reagent, and kaleidoscope protein molecular weight markers were obtained from Bio-Rad. Secondary anti-IgG antibodies raised in either rabbit or donkey labeled with Alexa Fluor 488 (green), 594 (red), and 647 (blue) were purchased from Molecular Probes, Inc. (Eugene, OR). Cell Cultures—H-411E cells, representing a minimal deviant rat hepatoma cell line, were obtained from ATCC and were grown in Eagle's minimum essential medium supplemented with 1% glutamine, 1% nonessential amino acids, 1% streptomycin/penicillin, and serum (10% calf serum, 5% fetal bovine serum). Cells were cultured at 37 °C in 5% CO2 and 95% air in a humidified incubator and routinely subcultured when they became 90-100% confluent. Immunoprecipitation and Western Blot Analysis—Cells were cultured in 60 × 15-mm sterile Petri dishes until they reached 70-80% confluence. Before treatment with insulin, complete growth medium was changed to serum-free medium (Eagle's minimum essential medium, 1% glutamine, nonessential amino acids, and antibiotics) for 36-40 h. Following treatment with insulin (10,000 microunits/ml) for various durations as indicated, total protein was extracted from the cells as described previously (19Keembiyehetty C.N. Candelaria R.P. Majumdar G. Raghow R. Martinez-Hernandez A. Solomon S.S. Endocrinology. 2002; 143: 1512-1520Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar), with minor modifications. To analyze phosphorylation and O-glycosylation of Sp1 in the presence of STZ and insulin, H-411E cells were treated with or without insulin (10,000 microunits/ml) in the presence of STZ (5 mm) for 4 h. Briefly, cells were washed twice with phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) and radioimmune precipitation buffer (1× PBS, 1% igepal (CA-230; Sigma), 0.5% sodium deoxycholate, 0.1% SDS) containing 0.5 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 0.5 mm dithiothreitol, 1.0 mm sodium orthovanadate, 0.5 mm aprotinin, and protease inhibitor mixture. Cells were scraped, collected into an Eppendorf tube, and then passed through a 21-gauge syringe needle to disrupt them. Homogenized cells were kept on ice for 30-60 min and then centrifuged at 10,000 × g for 10 min. The supernatant was collected, and the protein content was quantified using the Bio-Rad protein assay kit. For the immunoprecipitation reaction, 500 μg of protein were added to 4 μl of anti-Sp1 antibody in the binding buffer (10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.9, 2 mm MgCl2, 0.15 mm NaCl, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 10% glycerol, and 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride) to a final concentration of 1 μg of protein/μl and incubated at 4 °C overnight. Protein-A-Sepharose (20 μl) was then added, and the mixture was incubated at 4 °C on a rocker platform for 2 h. The antibody-Protein A complexes were centrifuged (1000 × g), and the pellet was washed four times with binding buffer. The pellets were resuspended in 1× Laemmli sample buffer, boiled, and analyzed by SDS-PAGE. For Western blot analysis, equal amounts of protein from each sample were separated using 7.5% SDS-PAGE. After electrophoresis, the protein samples were transferred to an Immobilon-P transfer membrane (Millipore Corp., Bedford, MA) using a Trans-Blot electrophoresis transfer cell (Bio-Rad). Western blot analyses were conducted using rabbit polyclonal anti-Sp1 antibody (1:5000), monoclonal anti-O-linked GlcNAc antibody (1:1000), and anti-phosphoserine antibody (1:1000) followed by incubation with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibody. To quantify the protein, a chemiluminescent signal was developed using detection reagents from the ECL Plus kit (Amersham Biosciences), and the signal was recorded on x-ray film. The blots probed with either anti-O-GlcNAc antibody or anti-phosphoserine antibody were stripped and reprobed with anti-Sp1 antibody to determine total Sp1. Western blot membranes were stripped and probed again with anti-actin antibody (1:10,000) to determine the equivalency of protein loading and specificity of insulin effect. The data from individual Western blots representing Sp1, O-GlcNAc, phosphoserine, or actin, were quantified by densitometry and subjected to statistical analysis. Mass Spectrometry—The details of the method used for the analysis of Sp1 by MALDI-TOF MS have been outlined previously (20Solomon S.S. Buss N. Shull J. Monnier S. Majumdar G. Wu J. Gerling I.C. J.

Briefly, after fractionation of protein(s) by SDS-PAGE, the gel was fixed in 50% methanol and 7% glacial acetic acid for 30 min and stained with SYPRO Ruby Stain (Bio-Rad) overnight at room temperature. The protein bands were visualized under UV light, and excised gel bands of Sp1 were placed in deionized water. The water was then removed, and the gel was dried in a vacuum centrifuge. Once dried, the gel pieces were subjected to trypsin digestion in situ and processed to be spotted on the MALDI plate and characterized by mass spectrometry as previously reported (20Solomon S.S.

To identify serines involved in O-glycosylation and phosphorylation during insulin stimulation by MALDI-TOF MS, H-411E cells were exposed to insulin at 0, 30, and 240 min. Total protein was extracted from the cells and immunoprecipitated with anti-Sp1 antibodies. The immunoprecipitated Sp1 was subjected to SDS-PAGE, and the protein band corresponding to Sp1 (as identified by reaction with Sp1 antibody on a parallel lane) was excised. The putative Sp1 band was digested with trypsin, extracted from the gel, and subjected to MALDI-TOF MS. The peptide mass fingerprint data were analyzed on the EXPASY server (available on the World Wide Web at us.expasy.org) using ALDENTE as the tool to identify proteins and their modifications (20Solomon S.S.

Cell Fixation and Confocal Microscopy—Cells were cultivated on glass slides, washed in PBS two times (5 min each), and fixed in 10% formalin for 10 min. Slides were washed twice in PBS (5 min each), and cells were made permeable in 0.3% Triton X-100 for 15 min. Next, the cells were incubated in 1:1 cold acetone/methanol solution for 10 min at 4 °C and allowed to air-dry. To block nonspecific antibody-binding sites, cells were preincubated in 1% bovine serum albumin in PBST (PBS containing 0.1% Tween 20) for 1 h. To examine glycosylated Sp1, fixed cells in one well of the two-well glass chamber slides were reacted with anti-Sp1 (1:400) rabbit polyclonal antibody (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) and anti-O-GlcNAc (1:250) mouse monoclonal antibody. The other well was stained for phosphorylated Sp1 using anti-Sp1 antibody and anti-phosphoserine (1:300) mouse monoclonal antibody. The cells were incubated for 1 h with primary antibodies diluted in 1% bovine serum albumin in PBST. Cells were then washed in PBST five times (15 min each wash), and the fluorochrome-tagged secondary antibodies were incubated for 1 h in the dark at room temperature: anti-rabbit IgG tagged with Alexa 488 (green) (1:300) to detect anti-Sp1, anti-mouse IgG1 tagged with Alexa 594 (red) (1:400) to detect phosphoserine, and anti-mouse IgG1 tagged with Alexa 647 (blue) (1:400) to recognize O-GlcNAc antibody. Following incubation, cells were washed three times in PBST (15 min each wash). Slides were air-dried and mounted with anti-fading reagent mounting medium containing 4′,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole to detect nuclear staining (Molecular Probes anti-fade kit). Images were obtained using a Zeiss inverted laser-scanning microscope LSM 510 with a confocal scan head and krypton/argon mixed gas laser. To detect phosphorylation and glycosylation of Sp1 in response to insulin, H-411E cells were incubated with or without insulin (10,000 micrograms/ml) at 0-, 30-, and 240-min intervals. In the presence of STZ and insulin, cells were incubated for 4 h. Confocal microscopy was then performed on cells stained with specific combinations of primary and secondary antibodies as described above. mRNA Analysis—Cells were treated with insulin for different time intervals. Parallel cultures were also treated with insulin in the presence or absence of STZ. Total RNA was extracted at various intervals after insulin treatment, and mRNA analysis was performed by Northern blot using a cDNA probe for CaM described previously (19Keembiyehetty C.N. Candelaria R.P. Majumdar G. Raghow R. Martinez-Hernandez A. Solomon S.S. Endocrinology. 2002; 143: 1512-1520Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar). Statistical Analysis—Protein bands, developed by multiple exposure of x-ray films to assure exposure in the linear range, were scanned and quantified using the Quantity One software program from Bio-Rad with a Macintosh G-3 computer. Mean, S.D., S.E., and Student's t tests were calculated using the Excel program. These data were then grouped and analyzed statistically as shown. For paired t, this is so stated; if unpaired, it is referred to simply as “Student's t test.” Insulin-induced Subcellular Localization of O-Glycosylated and Phosphorylated Sp1: Confocal Microscopy—In order to directly visualize the subcellular distribution of the total, O-glycosylated, and phosphorylated Sp1, H-411E hepatoma cells cultured in glass chamber slides were exposed to insulin for different time intervals. At the denoted times, changes in total Sp1, O-GlcNAc, and phosphoserine were assessed by highly specific primary antibodies followed by their reaction with secondary antibodies labeled with fluorescent tags of different colors. Fig. 1A demonstrates that in response to insulin treatment, total Sp1 (green) increased over a 240-min period. Although there is a detectable amount of immunoreactive Sp1 in the cytoplasm, there is insignificant change in cytoplasmic accumulation of Sp1 following insulin treatment (Fig. 1A, b-d); in contrast, insulin treatment greatly enhanced the accumulation of nuclear Sp1. The nucleoli are consistently devoid of immunoreactive Sp1 regardless of the treatment. It is also evident that insulin induced a brisk O-GlcNAcylation of many cytoplasmic and nuclear proteins; O-GlcNAc-specific blue fluorescence staining peaked at 30 min after insulin treatment but declined thereafter at 60 and 240 min. Co-localization of Sp1 (green) and O-GlcNAc (blue) can be readily appreciated as turquoise immunofluorescence (blue + green). An increase in the O-glycosylated Sp1 in the nuclei of insulin-treated H-411E cells is seen at 30 min with a progressive decrease in turquoise immunofluorescence at 60 and 240 min. Thus, the pattern of accumulation of O-GlcNAc-modified Sp1 and the total Sp1 in response to insulin treatment is very different, since there is sustained enhancement of total Sp1 as judged by intense green fluorescence in the nuclei of insulin-treated cells. Interestingly, although abundant blue fluorescence representing O-GlcNAc-modified proteins can be detected at or near the nuclear membrane, this location is particularly devoid of O-glycosylated Sp1 (turquoise). Similarly, the nucleolus is also devoid of O-GlcNAc-modified proteins as well as Sp1, regardless of whether or not it is glycosylated (Figs. 1 and 3).FIGURE 3A, accumulation of enhanced levels of O-GlcNAc-modified Sp1 in STZ-treated H-411E cells after insulin treatment. H-411E cells were treated with insulin alone or STZ alone or co-treated with insulin plus STZ for 4 h and reacted with anti-Sp1 (green) and anti-O-GlcNAc (blue) antibodies. Cells treated with STZ alone had more nuclear Sp1 (upper panel, c) than untreated controls (upper panel, a) but less than insulin-treated cells (upper panel, b). Cells treated with insulin plus STZ had more demonstrable cytoplasmic Sp1 than any other treatment, suggesting a combination of increased synthesis and decreased transport. O-GlcNAc residues were not present in the nucleolus with any treatment. However, cells treated with insulin plus STZ had demonstrable cytoplasmic Sp1 and O-GlcNAc residues (middle panel, h). Co-localization of Sp1 and O-GlcNAc-specific immunoreactivity shows that the nuclear periphery (blue rim) is devoid of Sp1 (lower panel, j, k, and l), regardless of treatment. O-GlcNAc-modified Sp1 continues to persist in the nucleus and cytoplasm of STZ-treated and insulin plus STZ-co-treated cells (lower panel, k and l). This is in contrast to the decreased amount of O-glycosylated Sp1 in cells treated with insulin alone (lower panel, j). Magnification is × 200. B, enhanced accumulation of phosphorylated Sp1 in STZ-treated H-411E cells is inhibited by insulin treatment. H-411E cells treated with insulin alone, STZ alone, or insulin plus STZ for 4 h were reacted with anti-Sp1 (green) and anti-phosphoserine (red) antibodies. The distribution of Sp1 immunoreactivity is similar to the distribution displayed in the previous figures (A, upper panel, a-d). Abundant phosphoserine-specific staining can be observed in the nucleus and cytoplasm of insulin-treated cells (middle panel, f). Treatment with STZ (middle panel, g) resulted in more phosphoserine-specific staining in nuclei and cytoplasm than in untreated cells (middle panel, e) but less than that seen in insulin-treated cells (middle panel, f). Combined treatment with insulin and STZ (middle panel, h) resulted in reduced levels of phosphoserine-specific staining in nuclei and cytoplasm than with either agent alone (middle panel, f and g). Magnification of a, e, and i is × 40. Magnification of all other images is × 200.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) We also stained H-411E cells with anti-phosphoserine antibody, followed by red fluorescence-conjugated secondary antibody. As we have observed repeatedly, insulin stimulated accumulation of total Sp1 over the 240-min duration of treatment, as judged by increased accumulation of green fluorescence. Additionally, insulin treatment steadily enhanced the staining for anti-phosphoserine antibodies as detected with secondary antibody tagged with red fluorescence (Fig. 1B). Thus, there is a generally increased accumulation of phophoserine-containing proteins in insulin-treated cells. However, insulin also specifically stimulated phosphorylation of Sp1 as judged by co-localization of Sp1-specific (green) and phosphoserine-specific (red) staining that is visible as yellow fluorescence. Interestingly, although phosphoserine-specific immunoreactivity abounds in the cytoplasm of insulin-treated H-411E cells (Fig. 1B, g and h), there is no detectable phosphorylated Sp1 in the cytoplasm. In contrast, the insulin-induced accumulation of phosphorylated Sp1 in the nucleus continued to increase over the 240-min time period. Finally, as opposed to what we observed for O-GlcNAc staining, the phosphoserine-specific antibody strongly stained the nucleoli (Fig. 1B, k and l). Thus, although nucleoli are characteristically devoid of Sp1, these organelles are significantly enriched in phosphoserine-containing immunoreactivity (Fig. 1B, k and l). Temporal Dynamics of Accumulation of O-Glycosylated and Phosphorylated Sp1 and the Steady State Levels of CaM mRNA in H-411E Cells—To study the relationship between O-glycosylation and phosphorylation of Sp1, H-411E hepatoma cells were exposed to insulin for 0, 30, and 240 min, and the levels of O-GlcNAc-modified and phosphorylated Sp1 were assessed by Western blot analysis (Fig. 2A). The quantification of O-GlcNAc and phosphorylated Sp1 as probed with specific antibodies on Western blots shows that O-GlcNAc-Sp1 increased significantly at 30 min (p < 0.03), whereas phosphorylated-Sp1 was negligible (p = not significant) at 30 min but continued to increase through 240 min (p < 0.03). In contrast, O-GlcNAc-Sp1 was on the decline by 240 min (p < 0.04). The quantitative Western blot data presented in Fig. 2A are in agreement with the results of confocal microscopy that suggest a reciprocal relationship between O-glycosylation and phosphorylation of Sp1 after insulin exposure. Regulation of CaM gene expression is a key read-out of insulin action in H-411E cells (23Solomon S.S. Palazzolo M.R. Smoake J.A. Raghow R.S. Biochem."
https://openalex.org/W2070228899,"The β-cell ATP-sensitive potassium (KATP) channel controls insulin secretion by linking glucose metabolism to membrane excitability. Loss of KATP channel function due to mutations in ABCC8 or KCNJ11, genes that encode the sulfonylurea receptor 1 or the inward rectifier Kir6.2 subunit of the channel, is a major cause of congenital hyperinsulinism. Here, we report identification of a novel KCNJ11 mutation associated with the disease that renders a missense mutation, F55L, in the Kir6.2 protein. Mutant channels reconstituted in COS cells exhibited a wild-type-like surface expression level and normal sensitivity to ATP, MgADP, and diazoxide. However, the intrinsic open probability of the mutant channel was greatly reduced, by ∼10-fold. This low open probability defect could be reversed by application of phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphates or oleoyl-CoA to the cytoplasmic face of the channel, indicating that reduced channel response to membrane phospholipids and/or long chain acyl-CoAs underlies the low intrinsic open probability in the mutant. Our findings reveal a novel molecular mechanism for loss of KATP channel function and congenital hyperinsulinism and support the importance of phospholipids and/or long chain acyl-CoAs in setting the physiological activity of β-cell KATP channels. The F55L mutation is located in the slide helix of Kir6.2. Several permanent neonatal diabetes-associated mutations found in the same structure have the opposite effect of increasing intrinsic channel open probability. Our results also highlight the critical role of the Kir6.2 slide helix in determining the intrinsic open probability of KATP channels. The β-cell ATP-sensitive potassium (KATP) channel controls insulin secretion by linking glucose metabolism to membrane excitability. Loss of KATP channel function due to mutations in ABCC8 or KCNJ11, genes that encode the sulfonylurea receptor 1 or the inward rectifier Kir6.2 subunit of the channel, is a major cause of congenital hyperinsulinism. Here, we report identification of a novel KCNJ11 mutation associated with the disease that renders a missense mutation, F55L, in the Kir6.2 protein. Mutant channels reconstituted in COS cells exhibited a wild-type-like surface expression level and normal sensitivity to ATP, MgADP, and diazoxide. However, the intrinsic open probability of the mutant channel was greatly reduced, by ∼10-fold. This low open probability defect could be reversed by application of phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphates or oleoyl-CoA to the cytoplasmic face of the channel, indicating that reduced channel response to membrane phospholipids and/or long chain acyl-CoAs underlies the low intrinsic open probability in the mutant.

Pancreatic ATP-sensitive potassium (KATP) channels play a key role in glucose-stimulated insulin secretion by coupling glucose metabolism to β-cell excitability (1Aguilar-Bryan L. Bryan J. Endocr.

Each KATP channel consists of four pore-forming Kir6.2 subunits encoded by KCNJ11 and four regulatory sulfonylurea receptor 1 (SUR1) receptors encoded by ABCC8 (4Clement J.P.t. Kunjilwar K.

The activity of KATP channels is subject to regulation by intracellular nucleotides ATP and ADP (1Aguilar-Bryan L. Bryan J. Endocr.

Ashcroft F. Diabetes. 2004; 53: 113-122Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar). ATP inhibits channel activity by binding to the Kir6.2 subunit, whereas ADP in complex with Mg2+ stimulates channel activity by interacting with SUR1. Changes in ATP and ADP concentrations during glucose metabolism are, thus, linked to KATP channel activity, which in turn controls β-cell membrane potential and insulin secretion. As such, genetic mutations in Kir6.2 or SUR1 that alter channel sensitivity to ATP or MgADP impair the ability of KATP channels to convert metabolic signals to electrical signal, resulting in insulin secretion diseases. In addition to intracellular nucleotides, both long chain acyl-CoAs and membrane phosphoinositides have been shown to stimulate channel activity and reduce channel sensitivity to ATP inhibition by interacting with Kir6.2 (9Gribble F.M.

However, compared with intracellular nucleotides, the role of membrane phosphoinositides or long chain acyl-CoAs in controlling KATP channel activity in physiological and pathological conditions is less clear and still under investigation (8Tarasov A.

Here, we report the identification and functional characterization of a dominant congenital hyperinsulinism-associated Kir6.2 missense mutation F55L. We show that this mutation greatly reduces the open probability of KATP channels in intact cells without affecting channel expression. The low channel activity is likely due to reduced channel response to membrane phosphoinositides and/or long chain acyl-CoAs, as application of exogenous PIP2 3The abbreviations used are: PIP2, phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate; WT, wild type; het, heterozygous; hom, homomeric. 3The abbreviations used are: PIP2, phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate; WT, wild type; het, heterozygous; hom, homomeric. or oleoyl-CoA restores channel activity to that seen in wild-type (WT) channels. Our finding identifies impaired KATP channel response to phospholipids and/or long chain acyl-CoAs as a novel mechanism underlying congenital hyperinsulinism. Clinical and Genetic Analyses—Tests of acute insulin responses to calcium (2 mg/kg), leucine (15 mg/kg), glucose (0.5 gm/kg), and tolbutamide (25 mg/kg) sequentially infused intravenously at intervals of 1 h were carried out as previously described (27Magge S.N. Shyng S.L. MacMullen C. Steinkrauss L. Ganguly A. Katz L.E. Stanley C.A. J. Clin. Endocrinol. Metab. 2004; 89: 4450-4456Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). Peripheral blood was obtained for isolation of genomic DNA from the proband, a male infant, and his father. Direct sequencing of DNA from the patient and family members was done as previously described (27Magge S.N. Shyng S.L. MacMullen C. Steinkrauss L. Ganguly A. Katz L.E. Stanley C.A. J. Clin. Endocrinol. Metab. 2004; 89: 4450-4456Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). Molecular Biology—Rat Kir6.2 cDNA is in pCDNAI/Amp vector (a generous gift from Dr. Carol A. Vandenberg) and SUR1 in pECE. Site-directed mutagenesis was carried out using the QuikChange site-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene), and the mutation was confirmed by sequencing. Mutant clones from two independent PCR reactions were analyzed to avoid false results caused by undesired mutations introduced by PCR. 86Rb+ Efflux Assay—COSm6 cells were plated onto 35-mm culture dishes and transfected with wild-type SUR1 and control or mutant rat Kir6.2 cDNA using FuGENE. Cells were incubated for 24 h in culture medium containing 86RbCl (1 μCi/ml) 2 days after transfection. Before measurement of 86Rb+ efflux, cells were incubated for 30 min at room temperature in Krebs-Ringer solution with metabolic inhibitors (2.5 μg/ml oligomycin and 1 mm 2-deoxy-d-glucose). At selected time points the solution was aspirated from the cells and replaced with fresh solution. At the end of a 40-min period, cells were lysed. The 86Rb+ in the aspirated solution and the cell lysate was counted. The percentage efflux at each time point was calculated as the cumulative counts in the aspirated solution divided by the total counts from the solutions and the cell lysates (25Shyng S.L. Ferrigni T. Shepard J.B. Nestorowicz A. Glaser B. Permutt M.A. Nichols C.G. Diabetes. 1998; 47: 1145-1151Crossref PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar). Western Blotting and Chemiluminescence Assay—Cell surface expression level of the mutant channel was assessed by Western blot and by a quantitative chemiluminescence assay using a SUR1 that was tagged with a FLAG epitope (DYKDDDDK) at the N terminus (fSUR1), as described previously (30Taschenberger G. Mougey A. Shen S. Lester L.B. LaFranchi S. Shyng S.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 17139-17146Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar). COSm6 cells grown in 35-mm dishes were transfected with 0.4 μg of rat Kir6.2 and 0.6 μg of fSUR1 and lysed 48-72 h post-transfection in 20 mm HEPES, pH 7.0, 5 mm EDTA, 150 mm NaCl, 1% Nonidet P-40 (IGAPEL) with CompleteTR protease inhibitors (Roche Applied Science). Proteins in the cell lysate were separated by SDS-PAGE (7.5% for SUR1 and 12% for Kir6.2), transferred to nitro-cellulose membranes, analyzed by incubation with appropriate primary antibodies followed by horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibodies (Amersham Biosciences), and visualized by enhanced chemiluminescence (Super Signal West Femto; Pierce). The primary antibodies used are: M2 mouse monoclonal anti-FLAG antibody for fSUR1 (Sigma) and rabbit polyclonal anti-Kir6.2 for Kir6.2 (from Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Santa Cruz, CA). For chemiluminescence assay, cells were fixed with 2% paraformaldehyde for 30 min at 4 °C. Fixed cells were preblocked in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) plus 0.1% bovine serum albumin (BSA) for 30 min, incubated in M2 anti-FLAG antibody (10 μg/ml) for 1 h, washed 4 × 30 min in PBS plus 0.1% BSA, incubated in horseradish peroxidase-conjugated anti-mouse (Jackson Immuno Research, Inc., 1:1000 dilution) for 20 min, and washed again 4 × 30 min in PBS plus 0.1% BSA, all at room temperature. Chemiluminescence of each dish was quantified in a TD-20/20 luminometer (Turner Designs) after 15 s of incubation in Power Signal enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay luminol solution (Pierce). All steps after fixation were carried out at room temperature. Electrophysiology—Patch clamp recordings were performed in the inside-out configuration as previously described (30Taschenberger G. Mougey A. Shen S. Lester L.B. LaFranchi S. Shyng S.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 17139-17146Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar). Briefly, COSm6 cells were transfected with cDNA encoding WT or mutant channel proteins as well as cDNA for the green fluorescent protein to help identify positively transfected cells. Patch clamp recordings were made 36-72 h post-transfection. Micropipettes were pulled from non-heparinized Kimble glass (Fisher) with resistance typically ∼1-2 megaohms. The bath (intracellular) and pipette (extracellular) solution (K-INT) had the following composition: 140 mm KCl, 10 mm K-HEPES, 1 mm K-EGTA, pH 7.3. ATP and ADP were added as the potassium salt. For measuring ATP sensitivity, 1 mm EDTA was included in K-INT to prevent channel rundown (31Lin Y.W. Jia T. Weinsoft A.M. Shyng S.L. J. Gen. Physiol. 2003; 122: 225-237Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). All currents were measured at a membrane potential of -50 mV (pipette voltage =+50 mV), and inward currents are shown as upward deflections. Data were analyzed using pCLAMP software (Axon Instrument). Off-line analysis was performed using Microsoft Excel programs. The MgADP or diazoxide response was calculated as the current in a K-INT solution containing either 0.1 mm ATP and 0.5 mm ADP or 0.1 mm ATP and 0.3 mm diazoxide (both with 1 mm free Mg2+) relative to that in plain K-INT solution. Data Analysis—ATP dose response curve fitting was performed with Origin 6.1. Channel intrinsic Po was estimated from stationary fluctuation analysis of short recordings (∼1 s) of macroscopic currents in K-INT/EDTA solution or K-INT/EDTA plus 5 mm ATP (32Neher E. Stevens C.F. Annu. Rev. Biophys. Bioeng. 1977; 6: 345-381Crossref PubMed Scopus (326) Google Scholar, 33Sigworth F.J. J. Physiol. (Lond.). 1980; 307: 97-129Crossref Scopus (541) Google Scholar, 34Shyng S. Ferrigni T. Nichols C.G. J. Gen. Physiol. 1997; 110: 141-153Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar). Currents were filtered at 1 kHz. Mean current (I) and variance (σ2) in the absence of ATP were obtained by subtraction of the mean current and variance in 5 mm ATP. Single channel current (i) was assumed to be -3.6 pA at -50 mV (corresponding to single channel conductance of 72 picosiemens). Po was then calculated using the following equation: Po = 1 - (σ2/(i × I)). Statistical analysis was performed using independent two-population two-tailed Student's t test. Patient History and Identification of the F55L Missense Mutation in Kir6.2—The proband was a male infant diagnosed with persistent hypoglycemia and hyperinsulinism at 12 h of age (14 microunits/ml with a blood glucose level of 31 mg/dl; 13 microunits/ml with a blood glucose of 24 mg/dl; normal, <3 microunits/ml). Tests of acute insulin responses to secretogogues were performed in the proband and his father, and results compared with hyperinsulinism patients with recessive ABCC8 null mutations (3992-9 G→A and ΔF1388) and glutamate dehydrogenase mutations and normal adult controls (35Henwood M.J. Kelly A. Macmullen C. Bhatia P. Ganguly A. Thornton P.S. Stanley C.A. J. Clin. Endocrinol. Metab. 2005; 90: 789-794Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). The proband showed a pattern of responses similar to those seen in patients with recessive ABCC8 mutations, an abnormal positive insulin response to calcium stimulation, as well as possibly diminished responses to glucose and tolbutamide (Table 1). The father of the proband had mildly abnormal acute insulin responses, including abnormally increased insulin responses to calcium and leucine and a lower response to tolbutamide than to glucose stimulation. This pattern of insulin responses resembles that seen in children with hyperinsulinism due to recessive ABCC8 and KCNJ11 mutations that retain partial channel activity (35Henwood M.J. Kelly A. Macmullen C. Bhatia P. Ganguly A. Thornton P.S. Stanley C.A. J. Clin. Endocrinol. Metab. 2005; 90: 789-794Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). Subsequent genetic testing revealed that the proband and the father shared a 165C→A mutation in the KCNJ11, resulting in a missense mutation, F55L, in the Kir6.2 subunit of the KATP channel. Of note, although the father showed mildly abnormal acute insulin responses as well as evidence of protein-sensitive hypoglycemia (blood glucose nadir of 63 mg/dl at 60 min after ingestion of oral protein; normal, >70 mg/dl), he demonstrated normal fasting blood glucose (84 mg/dl after a 12-h fast). The more severe hypoglycemia seen in the proband, at least in the newborn period, is likely attributed in part to perinatal stress, as has been reported previously (36Collins J.E. Leonard J.V.

Within 4 days, he was able to fast 12 h without hypoglycemia. Periodic reassessments up to 4 years of age showed that, whereas on treatment with a low dose of diazoxide at 4 mg/kg/day, the proband was able to fast successfully for 12-15 h without hypoglycemia and did not develop hypoglycemia in response to an oral protein tolerance test (1 g/kg). The F55L Mutation Reduces Open Probability of KATP Channels—To investigate how the F55L mutation in Kir6.2 affects channel function, we reconstituted the mutant channels in COS cells by co-expression of F55L-Kir6.2 and SUR1. To first confirm reduction or loss of channel activity in intact cells during glucose deprivation, as one would predict based on the disease phenotype, we performed 86Rb+ efflux assays to assess channel activity in response to metabolic poisoning. As shown in Fig. 1A, homomeric mutant channels are much less active upon metabolic inhibition compared with WT channels. Because the F55L mutation is heterozygous in the patient, we simulated the heterozygous state by co-expressing WT and mutant Kir6.2 at a 1:1 cDNA molar ratio with SUR1 (referred to as hetF55L). The hetF55L channels, although are much more active than homomeric F55L mutant channels (referred to as homF55L), are still less active than WT channels. These results demonstrate the causal role of the Kir6.2 F55L mutation in congenital hyperinsulinism. The reduced activity of the mutant channel upon metabolic inhibition could be due to reduced surface expression or altered gating properties (3Huopio H. Shyng S.L. Otonkoski T. Nichols C.G. Am. J. Physiol. Endocrinol. Metab. 2002; 283: 207-216Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar). To distinguish between these possibilities, we compared the level of surface expression of mutant channels to that of WT channels. Western blots showed that the steady-state mutant Kir6.2 protein level is similar to WT Kir6.2 (Fig. 1B, left). Moreover, fSUR1 co-expressed with the F55L mutant Kir6.2 exhibits core-glycosylated as well as complex-glycosylated forms comparable with that observed in fSUR1 co-expressed with WT Kir6.2 (Fig. 1B, left), indicating the mutation does not affect surface expression of the channel. Quantification of surface expression by chemiluminescence assays further corroborated the conclusion that the F55L mutation does not affect channel expression (Fig. 1B, right). The above results suggest that the reduced activity seen in the mutant is likely due to altered gating regulation. We, therefore, carried out detailed electrophysiological analysis using the inside-out patch clamp recording technique. Upon patch excision into ATP-free solution, WT channels gave averaged currents of ∼2 nA at -50 mV with symmetrical potassium concentrations on both sides of the membrane. By contrast, the averaged current amplitude from the F55L mutant channels was only ∼0.2 nA. To test whether the reduction in current amplitude results from reduced single channel conductance or channel open probability, we performed single channel recording of the mutant. The F55L mutant exhibited single channel conductance (70.4 ± 1.6 picosiemens) comparable with that of WT channel (68.0 ± 3.1 picosiemens). However, the channel open probability appears greatly reduced (Fig. 1C). These results show that the mutation reduces the ATP-independent open probability (referred to as the intrinsic open probability in this study) of KATP channels. Effects of PIP2 and Oleoyl-CoA on the F55L Mutant Channel—Membrane phosphoinositides, in particular PIP2, are known to affect the open probability of KATP channels (15Baukrowitz T. Schulte U.

J. 2000; 78: 2334-2348Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar). Recently, we reported that expression of Kir6.2 constructs with deliberate mutations that abolish channel sensitivity to PIP2 (R176A, R177A, R206A) in the insulin-secreting cell INS-1 results in phenotypes mimicking those seen in congenital hyperinsulinism. These include reduced KATP channel activity, depolarized membrane potential, and excessive insulin secretion at basal glucose concentration. We, therefore, hypothesize that the reduced channel open probability observed in the F55L mutant could be due to attenuated channel response to PIP2. Supporting this hypothesis, we found that in inside-out patch clamp recordings application of exogenous PIP2 (5 μm) to the cytoplasmic face of the membrane markedly increased the current amplitude of the F55L mutant channels (Fig. 2A). The -fold increase in current amplitude upon PIP2 stimulation for WT, hetF55L, and homF55L channels is 1.27 ± 0.08, 2.27 ± 0.34, and 10.02 ± 2.39, respectively (Table 2). Based on the -fold increase in current amplitude, we expect the Po of WT, hetF55L, and homF55L channels to be ∼0.78, 0.44, and 0.1, respectively, assuming the maximal Po after PIP2 stimulation is near 1 for all channels.

Physiol. 1997; 110: 141-153Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar), we estimated the Po of WT, hetF55L, and homF55L channels before and after PIP2 stimulation. As shown in Table 1, the Po for WT, hetF55L, and homF55L channels before PIP2 application was 0.81 ± 0.02, 0.66 ± 0.04, and 0.11 ± 0.01, respectively. After PIP2 stimulation, the Po for WT, hetF55L, and homF55L channels increased to 0.94 ± 0.01, 0.89 ± 0.02, and 0.72 ± 0.04. These numbers are in general agreement with the trend expected based on macroscopic current amplitude increase. However, note that the Po estimated by the noise analysis is likely higher because underestimation of the noise due to filtering (32Neher E. Stevens C.F. Annu. Rev. Biophys. Bioeng. 1977; 6: 345-381Crossref PubMed Scopus (326) Google Scholar, 33Sigworth F.J. J. Physiol. (Lond.). 1980; 307: 97-129Crossref Scopus (541) Google Scholar, 34Shyng S. Ferrigni T. Nichols C.G. J.

Also, the maximal Po estimated by noise analysis after PIP2 stimulation for homF55L mutant channels is 0.72, significantly lower than 1 (p < 0.01). Therefore, the intrinsic Po of the homF55L mutant channel is likely below 0.1 (based on a ∼10-fold increase in macroscopic currents after PIP2 stimulation and the estimated maximal Po of 0.72).TABLE 2Effects of PIP2 and oleoyl CoA on channel activityChannelIntrinsic PoaPo values were derived from noise analysis.PoaPo values were derived from noise analysis. after 5 μm PIP2Po after 5 μm oleoyl-CoACurrent increase after 5 μm PIP2 (fold)Current increase after 5 μm oleoyl=CoA (-fold)WT0.81 ± 0.020.94 ± 0.010.94 ± 0.011.27 ± 0.081.18 ± 0.03(n = 13)(n = 6)(n = 7)(n = 6)(n = 7)F55L0.11 ± 0.010.72 ± 0.040.66 ± 0.0510.02 ± 2.3913.12 ± 2.48(n = 25)(n = 10)(n = 15)(n = 10)(n = 15)WT + F55L0.66 ± 0.040.89 ± 0.020.88 ± 0.042.27 ± 0.342.01 ± 0.22(n = 8)(n = 3)(n = 5)(n = 3)(n = 5)a Po values were derived from noise analysis.

https://openalex.org/W2073131340,"We have previously shown that the breast cancer susceptibility gene, BRCA1, can transcriptionally activate the p27Kip1 promoter. The BRCA1-responsive element was defined as a 35 bp region from position −545 to −511. We next determined that within this region is also a potential binding site for the transcription factor Forkhead box (FOX)A1. RNA and protein analysis as well as immunohistochemistry showed that expression of FOXA1 correlated with the expression of the estrogen receptor in a panel of breast cancer cell lines and tissues. In transient transfection reporter assays, FOXA1 could activate the p27Kip1 promoter. Cotransfection of BRCA1 and FOXA1 resulted in a synergistic activation of the p27Kip1 promoter. Mutation of the FOXA1 DNA-binding site in the p27Kip1 promoter-luciferase construct significantly diminished the activity of FOXA1 alone or in combination with BRCA1. Cotransfection of FOXA1 and BRCA1 resulted in a greater amount of each protein compared to transfection of each expression vector alone. The half-life of FOXA1 was increased when coexpressed with BRCA1. Electrophoretic mobility shift assay analysis demonstrated that FOXA1 could bind to a wild-type oligonucleotide containing the FOXA1 binding site in the p27Kip1 promoter, but this binding was lost upon mutation of this FOXA1 binding site. The protein–DNA binding complex could be supershifted with an antibody directed against FOXA1. The activity of the p27Kip1 promoter as well as FOXA1 expression was reduced in cells treated with BRCA1 siRNA, thus silencing the expression of BRCA1 protein. In summary, we identified a FOXA1 binding site within the BRCA1-responsive element of the p27Kip1 promoter and showed that FOXA1 activated the promoter alone and in conjunction with BRCA1. Furthermore, we identified high expression of FOXA1 in breast cancer cell lines and tissues, discovered a role for BRCA1 in the regulation of p27Kip1 transcription and a possible interaction with BRCA1."
https://openalex.org/W2071128676,"There is an ongoing controversy regarding the relevance of apoptosis induction by ionizing irradiation as compared with other end points including transient or permanent cell cycle arrest of damaged cells. Here, we show that such permanent cell cycle arrest and apoptosis represent two sides of the same coin. MCF-7 cells fail to express procaspase-3, which results in resistance to apoptosis induced by anticancer drugs. Conversely, restoration of procaspase-3 sensitizes MCF-7 cells to chemotherapeutics including epirubicine, etoposide and taxol. In contrast, irradiation does not trigger apoptotic cell death but results in prolonged arrest in the G2 phase of the cell division cycle regardless of procaspase-3 expression. This suggested that the propensity of MCF-7 cells to arrest at the G2 checkpoint results in resistance to apoptosis upon γ-irradiation. This G2 arrest was associated with upregulation of p21CIP/WAF-1. Inhibition of DNA-damage-induced stress kinases and p21CIP/WAF-1 expression by caffeine abrogated G2 arrest and induced apoptosis of the irradiated cells in a caspase-3-dependent manner. Inhibition of cell cycle progression by adenoviral expression of the cyclin dependent kinase inhibitor p21CIP/WAF-1 prevented apoptosis upon caffeine treatment indicating that cell cycle progression, that is, G2-release, is required for induction of apoptosis. Likewise, cells homozygously deleted for p21CIP/WAF-1 (HCT116 p21−/−) display enhanced irradiation-induced apoptosis via a caspase-3-dependent mechanism. These data indicate that the disruption of G2 checkpoint control overcomes cell cycle arrest and resistance to γ-irradiation-induced cell death. Thus, DNA damage may trigger a permanent G2 arrest as an initial inactivation step of tumor cells where the phenomenon of apoptosis is hidden unless cell cycle arrest is overcome. The efficient induction of apoptosis upon G2 release thereby depends on the propensity to activate the key executioner caspase-3. This finding is of crucial importance for the understanding of molecular steps underlying the efficacy of ionizing radiation to delete tumor cells."
https://openalex.org/W2168640804,"Regions of protein-tyrosine phosphatase (PTP) 1B that are distant from the active site yet affect inhibitor binding were identified by a novel library screen. This screen was based on the observation that expression of v-Src in yeast leads to lethality, which can be rescued by the coexpression of PTP1B. However, this rescue is lost when yeast are grown in the presence of PTP1B inhibitors. To identify regions of PTP1B (amino acids 1-400, catalytic domain plus 80-amino acid C-terminal tail) that can affect the binding of the difluoromethyl phosphonate (DFMP) inhibitor 7-bromo-6-difluoromethylphosphonate 3-naphthalenenitrile, a library coexpressing PTP1B mutants and v-Src was generated, and the ability of yeast to grow in the presence of the inhibitor was evaluated. PTP1B inhibitor-resistant mutations were found to concentrate on helix α7 and its surrounding region, but not in the active site. No resistant amino acid substitutions were found to occur in the C-terminal tail, suggesting that this region has little effect on active-site inhibitor binding. An in-depth characterization of a resistant substitution localizing to region α7 (S295F) revealed that this change minimally affected enzyme catalytic activity, but significantly reduced the potency of a panel of structurally diverse DFMP PTP1B inhibitors. This loss of inhibitor potency was found to be due to the difluoro moiety of these inhibitors because only the difluoro inhibitors were shifted. For example, the inhibitor potency of a monofluorinated or non-fluorinated analog of one of these DFMP inhibitors was only minimally affected. Using this type of library screen, which can scan the nearly full-length PTP1B sequence (catalytic domain and C-terminal tail) for effects on inhibitor binding, we have been able to identify novel regions of PTP1B that specifically affect the binding of DFMP inhibitors.

A traditional approach to understanding the structural interactions between an inhibitor and enzyme is through crystallographic studies of the inhibitor-enzyme complex. Solving the three-dimensional structure of such complexes can identify the key residues that interact with the inhibitor, providing an understanding of the mechanism of inhibition. This is normally accompanied by site-directed mutagenesis of the interacting residues to validate their role in inhibitor binding and to determine the degree to which this interaction contributes to inhibitor potency. Such structures are also important in drug design, as they allow the identification of potential interactions that could improve inhibitor potency using further chemical modifications.

Strategies. 2005; 2: 129-135Crossref Scopus (73) Google Scholar), has had a number of published inhibitor-enzyme complexes, and the determinants required for the binding of various inhibitors have been identified. Because these inhibitors all target the active site, the determinants identified are located in the active-site region. These include residues on the PTP loop (Ser216, Ala217, Gly218, Ile219, Gly220, and Arg221), on the WPD loop (Asp181 and Phe182), and on the substrate recognition loop (Lys36, Val49, and Lys120) and for inhibitors interacting with the secondary binding site (Tyr20, Arg24, His25, Phe52, and Arg254) (for reviews, see Refs. 3Zhang Z.-Y. Annu. Rev. Pharmocol. Toxicol. 2002; 42: 209-234Crossref PubMed Scopus (371) Google Scholar and 4Taylor S.D. Hill B. Expert Opin. Investig. Drugs. 2004; 13: 199-214Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar; see Fig. 4). Because of the static nature of crystal structures, only direct interactions between inhibitor and enzyme are observed. Because inhibitor/enzyme interactions are quite dynamic, it was of interest to determine whether residues in regions of PTP1B other than the active site could also influence inhibitor binding. A very well documented example of this is the drug-resistant mutations that arise in the human immunodeficiency virus type 1 protease during the treatment of AIDS. These mutations reduce inhibitor affinity, but maintain sufficient substrate affinity for the virus to replicate. Although some of these mutations are located in the active site, there is also an accumulation of mutations in regions distant from the active site (5Ohtaka H. Muzammil S. Schon A.

PDE-deficient yeast cells are sensitive to heat shock, but this phenotype can be complemented by expression of mammalian PDEs. Treatment of yeast expressing human PDE4 with specific PDE4 inhibitors such as rolipram abolishes this complementation and reverts the yeast to heat shock sensitivity. A random mutagenesis study was performed using this phenotypic readout to identify residues responsible for PDE4 drug sensitivity (7Pillai R. Kytle K. Reyes A. Colicelli J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.

We used a similar approach to identify additional regions of PTP1B that may influence the binding of the difluoromethyl phosphonate (DFMP) inhibitors (9Burke T.R. Kole H.R. Roller P.P. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1994; 204: 129-134Crossref PubMed Scopus (229) Google Scholar, 10Dufresne C. Roy P. Wang Z. Asante-Appiah E. Cromlish W. Boie Y. Forghani F. Desmarais S. Wang Q. Skorey K.

Kennedy B.P. Biochem. Pharmcol. 2004; 68: 1807-1814Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). The assay is based on the observation that expression of v-Src in yeast is lethal, but can be rescued by the coexpression of PTP1B. However, this rescue is lost when yeast cells coexpressing v-Src and PTP1B are grown in the presence of specific PTP1B inhibitors. To identify novel determinants of PTP1B inhibitor binding, a yeast library expressing v-Src and random mutants of nearly full-length PTP1B was generated and grown in the presence of the DFMP inhibitor 7-bromo-6-difluoromethylphosphonate 3-naphthalenenitrile (Inhibitor 1). Inhibitor-resistant colonies were recovered and sequenced, and the regions of PTP1B responsible for inhibitor resistance were identified. Inhibitor-resistant mutations clustered on helices α3, α6, and α7, but not in the active site. One of these mutations was characterized in detail and shown to elicit inhibitor resistance by selecting against the difluoro moiety of the DFMP inhibitor. Yeast Strain and Plasmid Constructs—The yeast strain used was YPH499 (MATa ura3-52 lys2-801amber ade2-101ocher trp1-Δ63 his3-Δ200 leu2Δ1; Stratagene). p416GAL1 (ATCC 87332) and p415GALL (ATCC 87338) are low copy vectors containing the URA3 marker for growth in uracil-deficient media and the LEU2 marker for growth in leucine-deficient media, respectively. The details of the construction of p416GAL1-PTP1B-(1-320) and p415GALL-v-Src have been described previously (12Montalibet J. Kennedy B.P. Biochem. Pharmcol. 2004; 68: 1807-1814Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). PTP1B-(1-400) was generated from the full-length construct (amino acids 1-435) by PCR using primers 5′-GAATTCATGGAGATGGAAAAGGAG-3′ and 5′-GTCGACCAGTGCCTAGTCCTCGTCCTTC-3′ to introduce EcoRI and SalI restriction sites and the following amplification program: 94 °C for 4 min and 25 cycles at 94 °C for 30 s, 50 °C for 30 s, and 72 °C for 1.5 min, followed by 72 °C for 10 min. The resulting PCR product was inserted in the pCRP®2.1-TOPO vector (TA Cloning®, Invitrogen). The PTP1B fragment was digested from the pCR®2.1 vector using EcoRI and SalI, cloned into p416GAL1, and sequenced. The S295F PTP1B-(1-320) mutant from the library screen was subcloned from p416GAL1 into pFLAG2 (Kodak) using EcoRI and SalI. Inhibitors—The PTP1B allosteric inhibitor 3-(3,5-dibromo-4-hydroxybenzoyl)-2-ethylbenzofuran-6-sulfonic acid-(4-(thiazol-2-ylsulfamyl)phenyl)amide was from Calbiochem (13Wiesmann C. Barr K.J. Kung J.

Ramachandran C. Biochem. J. 1999; 337: 219-223Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). Generation of the PTP1B Degenerate Library—A degenerate PCR was performed using a low fidelity polymerase (GeneMorph, Stratagene), 565 ng of p416GAL1-PTP1B-(1-400), and 100 ng of 5′-GTTAATATACCTCTATACTTTAAC-3′ as forward primer and 5′-CTTCCTTTTCGGTTAGAGCGGATG-3′ as reverse primer with the following program: 94 °C for 4 min and 25 cycles at 94 °C for 30 s, 60 °C for 30 s, and 72 °C for 1.5 min, followed by 72 °C for 10 min. These primers were designed to amplify a product starting 83 bp upstream of the PTP1B ATG start codon and 79 bp downstream of the TGA stop codon. The resulting product (∼1 μg) was gel-cleaned using the QIAquick gel extraction kit (Qiagen Inc.). The mutation rate was monitored by cloning an aliquot of the reaction in pCR®2.1-TOPO and sequencing the resulting clones. In the reaction mixture used for the library construction, 12 clones were sequenced, and the mutation rate obtained was three wild-type and three single, five double, and one triple mutation. Library Transformation—YPH499 cells were electroporated (15Nelson, Z. (2004) Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center http://www.fhcrc.org/labs/gottschling/yeast/ytrans.htmlGoogle Scholar) with plasmids p415GALL or p415GALL-v-Src. After 2 days of growth, 50 ml of leucine-deficient medium was inoculated with the resulting transformant for overnight growth. The resulting culture of yeast transformed with p415GALL-v-Src was re-transformed with the degenerate library using the lithium acetate method along with 1 μg of p416GAL1 vector linearized with EcoRI and SalI, dephosphorylated, and plated on leucine- and uracil-deficient plates with 2% galactose and 0.075% glucose (16Gietz R.D. Woods R.A. Methods Enzymol. 2002; 350: 87-96Crossref PubMed Scopus (2054) Google Scholar). An aliquot of the transformation was also plated on leucine- and uracil-deficient plates with 2% glucose to monitor the number of transformants obtained. Inhibitor Resistance Assay—The colonies resulting from the double transformation were picked after 3, 4, or 5 days of growth on agar plates and inoculated (∼0.2 μl) in 50 μl of 15% glycerol in the 60 center wells of a round bottom 96-well plate. 10 μl of this suspension was transferred to the center wells of a flat bottom 96-well plate containing 190 μl of leucine- and uracil-deficient medium with 2% galactose and 0.75 mm Inhibitor 1. The wells were overlaid with mineral oil and incubated at 30 °C, and the absorbance at 600 nm was read periodically (12Montalibet J. Kennedy B.P. Biochem. Pharmcol. 2004; 68: 1807-1814Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). The leftover glycerol suspension was stored at -80 °C. Plasmid Retrieval—Yeast plasmids from the frozen glycerol stock were retrieved from a 3-ml overnight culture. Briefly, the culture was treated for 1 h with 50 units of lyticase (Clontech), vortexed for 5 min with 250 μl of 400-500-μm glass beads, and purified with QIAprep spin minipreps (Qiagen Inc.). Larger yields of DNA used for sequencing were obtained by transforming MAX Efficiency® DH5α™ Escherichia coli cells (Invitrogen) with the material obtained from the yeast extraction and re-isolating the plasmid. The resulting plasmids were digested with EcoRI and SalI to confirm the presence of a library fragment and sequenced. Enzyme Kinetics—Wild-type PTP1B and the S295F mutant were expressed and purified from E. coli BL21 cells, and enzyme activities were assayed with p-nitrophenyl phosphate (pNPP), 3,6-fluorescein diphosphate (FDP), or difluoromethylumbelliferyl phosphate (DiFMUP) in 50 mm BisTris, 2 mm EDTA, 2% glycerol, 0.01% Triton, and 5 mm N,N′-dimethylbis(mercaptoacetyl)hydrazine (pH 6.3) as described previously (17Asante-Appiah E.

Product formation was monitored spectroscopically at 405 nm for pNPP and at 450 nm for FDP and by fluorescence at 450 nm from 360 nm excitation for DiFMUP. Michaelis-Menten parameters and turnover numbers were obtained by fitting the initial rates to the Michaelis-Menten equation using the nonlinear regression analysis package GraFit Version 4.0.10 (Eraticus Software Inc.). IC50 values were obtained from the initial rates of the reaction of wild-type or mutant PTP1B with the respective Km values for DiFMUP in the presence of inhibitor, fitted to a four-parameter inhibition curve. Ki values were obtained following the method of Cornish-Bowden (19Cornish-Bowden A. Fundamentals of Enzyme Kinetics. Portland Press Ltd., London1995Google Scholar) and analyzed using SigmaPlot (SYSTAT). For the allosteric inhibitor, the buffer conditions for the reaction were modified as follows: 50 mm HEPES, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm dithiothreitol, and 100 mm NaCl as described (13Wiesmann C. Barr K.J. Kung J. Zhu J. Erlanson D.A. Shen W. Fahr B.J. Zhong M. Taylor L. Randal M. McDowell R.S. Hansen S.K. Nat. Struct. Mol. Biol. 2004; 11: 730-737Crossref PubMed Scopus (398) Google Scholar). Crystallization and Data Collection—Apo-S295F mutant PTP1B crystals were obtained by vapor diffusion in sitting drops at 4 °C by mixing 2 μl of protein (10 mg/ml in 20 mm HEPES, 50 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, and 5 mm N,N′-dimethylbis(mercaptoacetyl)hydrazine (pH 7.0)) and 2 μl of precipitant solution (13-16% polyethylene glycol 3350, 100 mm HEPES, and 200 mm MgCl2 (pH 7.0)). X-ray diffraction data were collected on an ADSC Q4 detector from a single crystal of ∼0.1 × 0.03 × 0.03 mm in size. Data to 2.0-Å resolution were collected using an F-RD rotating anode (Rigaku) operating at 50 mV and 90 mA. Data processing, scaling, and merging were done with the software DPS/MOSFLM (20Rossmann M.G. van Beek C.G. Acta Crystallogr. Sect.

Use of Yeast to Identify Amino Acid Determinants of PTP1B Inhibitor Binding—Recently, we reported on a yeast assay to screen for PTP1B inhibitors (12Montalibet J. Kennedy B.P. Biochem. Pharmcol. 2004; 68: 1807-1814Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). The assay is based on the observation that v-Src overexpression in yeast is lethal, but yeast growth can be rescued by coexpression of PTP1B. This rescue is reversed when yeast cells coexpressing v-Src and PTP1B are grown in the presence of PTP1B inhibitors. Using this assay, the approach we took to identify inhibitor determinants was first to generate a library of PTP1B mutants by random mutagenesis using degenerate PCR. Yeast cells expressing v-Src were then transformed with the PTP1B mutants. If the mutation significantly affected PTP1B catalytic activity, the yeast cells did not grow. Those that grew were then cultured in the presence of specific PTP1B inhibitors. For the yeast to grow under these conditions, the PTP1B mutation must not only be catalytically active, but also have a reduced affinity for the inhibitor. Plasmids were then recovered from these resistant clones and sequenced to identify the residue that had been substituted. The PTP1B inhibitor that was used to screen for inhibitor determinants is shown in Fig. 1. We have shown previously that this inhibitor has no effect on yeast growth even at very high concentrations, but can efficiently inhibit the growth of yeast coexpressing v-Src and PTP1B with an EC50 of 0.17 mm (12Montalibet J. Kennedy B.P. Biochem. Pharmcol. 2004; 68: 1807-1814Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). The binding mode of the DFMP inhibitors in the PTP1B active site is well understood. In fact, the crystal structure of PTP1B complexed with (1,1-difluoro-1-(2-naphthalenyl)methyl)phosphonic acid, a very close analog of Inhibitor 1, has been reported previously (24Burke T.R. Ye B. Yan X. Wang S. Jia Z. Chen L. Zhang Z.Z. Barford D. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 15989-15996Crossref PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar). We have modeled Inhibitor 1 in the PTP1B active site to illustrate the direct interactions the inhibitor makes with the enzyme (Fig. 1). The DFMP group of Inhibitor 1 engages the phosphatase by extensive hydrogen bonding of the phosphonate with the PTP loop (24Burke T.R. Ye B. Yan X. Wang S. Jia Z. Chen L. Zhang Z.Z. Barford D.

The two fluorine atoms are within van der Waals distance of the phenyl side chain of Phe182 and are hydrogen-bonded through a water molecule to the side chain nitrogen of Gln266 and the main chain nitrogen of Phe182 (26Frangioni J.V.

The remainder of the molecule is situated within a hydrophobic pocket, with the naphthalene ring sandwiched between Tyr46 and Phe182 and the nitrile group pointing toward the secondary binding site. In addition, although there have been numerous crystal structures of PTP-1B with and without inhibitor, all have been done with the catalytic domain (amino acids 1-320 or 1-298), which excludes the effect of the PTP1B C terminus on inhibitor binding. The full-length PTP1B sequence is 435 amino acids, with the last 35 C-terminal amino acids anchoring PTP1B into the endoplasmic reticulum (26Frangioni J.V. Beahm P.H. Shifrin V. Jost C.A. Neel B.G. Cell. 1992; 68: 545-560Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (503) Google Scholar). Therefore, we decided to use PTP1B-(1-400) without the endoplasmic reticulum-anchoring sequence for the screen. Identification of Novel PTP1B Inhibitor Determinants—A yeast library (∼31,000 transformants) expressing v-Src and containing random mutants of PTP1B-(1-400) was generated as described under “Materials and Methods.” From this initial library, about half of the transformants (13,800) were able to rescue yeast from v-Src lethality. We next screened 2100 of these transformants for growth in the presence of 0.75 mm Inhibitor 1. At this inhibitor concentration, yeast growth was completely inhibited, and only 149 (∼7%) of the 2100 transformants were found to have a significant level of growth above the controls. Representative growth curves in the presence of Inhibitor 1 for some of these resistant colonies, as well as growth curves for the controls (yeast expressing only PTP1B, v-Src and PTP1B, and only v-Src), are shown in Fig. 2. The growth of yeast expressing only PTP1B (indistinguishable from wild-type yeast (12Montalibet J. Kennedy B.P. Biochem. Pharmcol. 2004; 68: 1807-1814Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar)) was not affected by the addition of Inhibitor 1 (Fig. 2). In contrast, no growth was observed for yeast coexpressing v-Src and PTP1B in the presence of the inhibitor or for yeast expressing only v-Src (lethal). Although they displayed a slight delay in growth compared with yeast expressing PTP1B alone, yeast coexpressing v-Src and a PTP1B inhibitor-resistant mutant had significant growth above the v-Src/PTP1B-expressing wild-type control. In fact, this delay was useful in the identification of false positives arising from the loss of v-Src expression (see clone 93 in Fig. 2); ∼10% of the resistant clones were false positives. When the PTP1B vector was recovered and sequenced for a number of these clones, several contained a wild-type PTP1B sequence. To confirm that the v-Src/PTP1B-expressing colonies were inhibitor-resistant, the PTP1B vector was recovered from a number of these colonies, re-transformed into v-Src-expressing yeast, and retested for inhibitor resistance. All colonies with delayed growth were inhibitor-resistant. 4J. Montalibet and B. P. Kennedy, unpublished data. The sequences of the PTP1B mutations from 41 inhibitor-resistant clones are listed in Table 2. There were a wide variety of mutations observed, including single and multiple mutations as well as truncations. Although additional resistant colonies could be sequenced, the significant level of mutant repetition found in Table 2 suggests that this is a good representative profile of resistant mutations. For example, many inhibitor-resistant clones have Glu297, Ser295, Trp291, Ala189, Ser187, and Glu186 substitutions, suggesting that there was a high level of mutagenesis and that the screen was fairly comprehensive.TABLE 2Nucleotide mutations and associated amino acid changes in inhibitor-resistant clonesLocationCloneNucleotidesAmino acidsN terminus of helix α31204G556AE186K135A557C, A1189delE186A, K397R then TRTRHWSTSSHVISYVTLTFTPSPHIRSNRKGRS460G342A, A400T, A422C, G556A, C1117TM114I, I134F, K141T, E186K, R373W1909T559C (T855A)S187P722C566TA189V1480(C-35A), (C-29T), T180A, A441C, (T528C), C573A, G1069A, G1126TH60Q, E147D, F191L, A357T, G376WC terminus of helix α6 and turn α6-α7546G108T, A828T, G847A, G952T, (A1019G)K36N, E276D, G283R, E318stop8G850delD284T then LPCRISGRSFPTRTWSPHPSISPHLPGHPNESWSHTMGNAGSSSQITSG355G846delD284T then LPCRISGRSFPTRTWSPHPSISPHLPGHPNESWSHTMGNAGSSSQITSGHelix α7754(A756G), C857T, C984A, A988G, C1163T, A1199GS286F, F328L, N330D, A388V, D400G176G9T, G10A, C624G, (C672T), C857T, (G1197A)M3I, E4K, H208Q, S286F742C862delQ288R then ISGRSFPTRTWSPHPSISPHLPGHPNESWSHTMGNAGSSSQITSG46C862T, (A916G)Q288stop262(C21T), C868T, (A1044T)Q290stop1504(G798A), C868T, (C984T)Q290stop235G873AW291stop670G872AW291stop404A412T, G873A, (A1111T)T138S, W291stop979T150A, G872AS50R, W291stop838A874GK292EC-terminal to helix α71036C884TS295F1422C884A, G1123A, (C1185A)S295Y, V375M1117C886delH296T then RTWSPHPSISPHLPGHPNESWSHTMGNAGSSSQITSG2034C833T, G889AA278V, E297K2039A65C, G889AD22A, E297KMultiple mutants in regions α3, α6, and α72067A837C, C895AK279N, L299M325(T261A), C376A, G847A, G892A, A1046T, T1116AP126T, G283R, D298N, E349V, S372R1363(C276T), C560T, A613G, A836GS187L, S205G, K279R1012C247G, A557T, T698C, G889AL83V, E186V, L233S, E297KLoop β9-β101823A449C, C908A, (C960T)K150T, P303H2024(C21T), A449G, C854A, G1112AK150R, S285Y1791(A336G), T454A, G790A, C994TY152N, A264T, Q332stop652A455G, (G471A), A497G, G565T, (C588T), G1031A, A1114del, (C+37T), (T+42C)Y152C,"
https://openalex.org/W2010595661,"LIM-only protein 4 (LMO4) plays critical roles in mammalian development, and has been proposed to play roles in epithelial oncogenesis, including breast cancer. As LMO4 is highly expressed in the epithelial compartments at locations of active mesenchymal-epithelial interactions, we reasoned that LMO4 might act by modulating signaling pathways involved in mesenchymal-epithelial signaling. One such candidate signal is the transforming growth factor-beta (TGFbeta) cytokine pathway, which plays important roles both in development and cancer. We show here that the transcriptional response to TGFbeta in epithelial cells is sensitive to LMO4 levels; both up- and downregulation of LMO4 can enhance TGFbeta signaling as assessed by a TGFbeta-responsive reporter gene. Furthermore, LMO4 can interact with the MH1 and linker domains of receptor-mediated Smad proteins, and associate with the endogenous TGFbeta-responsive Plasminogen Activator Inhibitor-1 gene promoter in a TGFbeta-dependent manner, suggesting that such interactions may mediate the effects of LMO4 on TGFbeta signaling. When introduced into mammary epithelial cells, LMO4 potentiated the growth-inhibitory effects of TGFbeta in those cells. These results define a new function for LMO4 as a coactivator in TGFbeta signaling, and provide a potential novel mechanism for LMO4-mediated regulation in development and oncogenesis."
https://openalex.org/W2029512058,"FE65 has been described as an adaptor protein; its partners include the beta-amyloid precursor protein (APP) and Tip60 (a histone acetyltransferase). Recent evidence suggests that APP may function in a nuclear signaling pathway via formation of APP-FE65-Tip60 complexes. The evidence is largely based on experiments in which APP/Tip60 is fused to the DNA binding domain of a yeast transcriptional factor Gal4 (Gal4DB) that can activate a reporter gene only when FE65 is coexpressed. One interpretation of published experiments has not yet been tested; however, there is the possibility that FE65 itself is the dominant transcriptional activator, whereas APP and Tip60 serve merely as positive/negative modulators or bridges for connecting FE65 to Gal4DB. To test this possibility, we fused Gal4DB directly to either end of FE65 and assessed their nuclear signaling in the presence or absence of exogenous APP/Tip60 or after knockdown of endogenous APP/Tip60. We found that FE65-Gal4DB by itself was able to trigger robust reporter activities. Increasing levels of APP could not further augment the reporter activity, but knocking down endogenous APP or interrupting FE65-APP binding reduced the signaling by up to 2-fold. The magnitudes of the reporter activities did not correlate with relative FE65 affinities for APP. Both overexpression and knockdown experiments showed that Tip60 plays a negative role. The results are consistent with the notion that FE65 is the key agent of Gal4DB-mediated transcriptional transactivation, whereas Tip60 is an FE65-associated repressor. Although APP may have modest stimulating effects, apparently there is no absolute requirement for that molecule for the nuclear signaling pathway."

https://openalex.org/W1970821658,"DNA gyrase is the only topoisomerase that can introduce negative supercoils into DNA. It is thought that the binding of conventional type II topoisomerases, including topoisomerase IV, to DNA takes place at the catalytic domain across the DNA gate, whereas DNA gyrase binds to DNA not only at the amino-terminal catalytic domain but also at the carboxyl-terminal domain (CTD) of the GyrA subunit. The binding of the GyrA CTD to DNA allows gyrase to wrap DNA around itself and catalyze the supercoiling reaction. Recent structural studies, however, have revealed striking similarities between the GyrA CTD and the ParC CTD, as well as the ability of the ParC CTD to bind and bend DNA. Thus, the molecular basis of gyrase-mediated wrapping of DNA needs to be reexamined. Here, we have conducted a mutational analysis to determine the role of the “GyrA-box,” a 7-amino acid-long motif unique to the GyrA CTD, in determining the DNA binding mode of gyrase. Either a deletion of the entire GyrA-box or substitution of the GyrA-box with 7 Ala residues abolishes the ability of gyrase to wrap DNA around itself and catalyze the supercoiling reaction. However, these mutations do not affect the relaxation and decatenation activities of gyrase. Thus, the presence of a GyrA-box allows gyrase to wrap DNA and catalyze the supercoiling reaction.

The consequence of the loss of the GyrA-box during evolution of bacterial type II topoisomerases is discussed. DNA topoisomerases are ubiquitous enzymes that alter the linking number of double-stranded DNA. There are two classes of topoisomerases, type I and type II (1Wang J.C. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1996; 65: 635-692Crossref PubMed Scopus (2086) Google Scholar, 2Champoux J.J. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2001; 70: 369-413Crossref PubMed Scopus (2218) Google Scholar). Type I topoisomerases alter the linking number in steps of one by breaking one strand of duplex DNA, passing the other strand through the break, and then resealing the broken strand, whereas type II topoisomerases alter the linking number in steps of two by breaking both strands, passing another segment of the helix through the break, and then resealing the broken strands. The discovery of a novel type II enzyme from Sulfolobus shibatae (3Bergerat A. de Massy B. Gadelle D. Varoutas P.C. Nicolas A. Forterre P.

Nishimura Y. Imamura R. Niki H. Hiraga S. Suzuki H. Cell. 1990; 63: 393-404Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (442) Google Scholar) are type IIA topoisomerases. Gyrase and Topo IV consist of GyrA and GyrB subunits and ParC and ParE subunits, respectively. GyrA and ParC subunits catalyze strand-breakage and reunion reactions, whereas GyrB and ParE subunits hydrolyze ATP. The active forms of gyrase and Topo IV are an α2β2 tetramer, and these topoisomerases bind double-stranded DNA. Topo IV can relax both positive and negative supercoils and catenate and decatenate covalently closed, negatively supercoiled, double-stranded circular (form I) and nicked or gapped, double-stranded circular DNA molecules. Gyrase can supercoil covalently closed, relaxed, double-stranded circular (form I′) DNA molecules, catenate and decatenate DNA rings, and, in the absence of ATP, relax negative supercoils (1Wang J.C. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1996; 65: 635-692Crossref PubMed Scopus (2086) Google Scholar, 2Champoux J.J. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2001; 70: 369-413Crossref PubMed Scopus (2218) Google Scholar). Among all topoisomerases, gyrase is the only enzyme that can introduce negative supercoils into DNA (1Wang J.C. Annu. Rev.

It is thought that the binding of Topo IV to DNA takes place only at the amino-terminal catalytic domain (NTD) of the ParC subunit across the DNA gate, whereas DNA gyrases bind to DNA at both the NTD and the carboxyl-terminal domain (CTD) of the GyrA subunit. It is the binding of the GyrA CTD to DNA that causes the wrapping of DNA and enables gyrase to catalyze supercoiling reaction (9Liu L.F. Wang J.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Grishin N. Proteins. 2002; 47: 258-264Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar), and not only the GyrA CTD but also the ParC CTD can bind and bend DNA (12Corbett K.D. Shultzaberger R.K. Berger J.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2004; 101: 7293-7298Crossref PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar). In addition, a single-molecule experiment has demonstrated that Escherichia coli Topo IV bends DNA upon its binding to DNA (17Charvin G. Strick T. Bensimon D. Croquette V. Biophys. J. 2005; 89: 384-392Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). Thus, the functional roles of GyrA and ParC CTDs need to be reexamined to determine the molecular basis of gyrase-mediated wrapping of DNA. It is noteworthy that gyrase-mediated wrapping of DNA, but not Topo IV-mediated bending of DNA, induces the constraint of supercoils in DNA and that the binding of the ParC CTD to DNA has not been detected by footprinting methods (18Peng H. Marians K.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 25286-25290Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). Is there any motif that distinguishes the GyrA CTDs from ParC CTDs? An amino acid sequence alignment supplemented with the secondary structure predictions has revealed that there are two structural differences between E. coli GyrA and E. coli ParC CTDs (12Corbett K.D. Shultzaberger R.K. Berger J.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2004; 101: 7293-7298Crossref PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar). One is the presence of a GyrA-box, QRRGGKG (19Ward D. Newton A. Mol. Microbiol. 1997; 26: 897-910Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar), in the first (the amino-terminal-most) blade of the GyrA CTD and the other is the fact that the β-pinwheel fold of the GyrA CTD consists of six blades, whereas that of the ParC CTD contains only five blades. Although all GyrA CTDs possess full six blades, ParC CTDs exhibit significant structural diversity with various numbers of blades (12Corbett K.D. Shultzaberger R.K. Berger J.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci.

Chem. 2005; 280: 26177-26184Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). We conducted a mutational analysis of the GyrA-box to determine its role in gyrase-mediated wrapping of DNA. We constructed two mutant E. coli GyrA proteins, GyrA A-del and GyrA-Ala, which contain the deletion of the entire GyrA-box (residues 560-566), and the substitution of the GyrA-box with 7 Ala residues, respectively. Either the deletion or Ala-substitution of the GyrA-box abolished the ability of E. coli gyrase to wrap DNA around itself and catalyze the supercoiling reaction. However, these mutations did not affect the relaxation and decatenation activities of gyrase. Thus, the GyrA-box is required for gyrase-mediated wrapping of DNA and gyrase-catalyzed supercoiling reaction. DNAs and Proteins—pBR322 form I DNA was purchased from New England Biolabs (Beverly, MA). Kinetoplast DNA (kDNA) was a generous gift of Yuzhen Wang and Junghuei Chen (University of Delaware). Two mutations were introduced into the E. coli gyrA gene using the overlap extension PCR technique (20Morton R.M. Hunt H.D. Ho S.N. Pullen J.K. Pease L.R. Methods Enzymol. 1993; 217: 270-279Crossref PubMed Scopus (432) Google Scholar). One is the deletion of the GyrA-box, gyrA A-del, and the other is the substitution of the entire GyrA-box with Ala residues, gyrA A-Ala (Fig. 1). DNA sequences of the open reading frames were confirmed by dideoxy DNA sequencing (data not shown). The gyrA A-del and gyrA A-Ala genes were cloned into the pET-11c vector (21Studier W.F. Rosenberg A.H. Dunn J.J. Methods Enzymol. 1990; 185: 60-89Crossref PubMed Scopus (6006) Google Scholar), and the mutant GyrA proteins were expressed in E. coli BL21(DE3) (21Studier W.F. Rosenberg A.H. Dunn J.J. Methods Enzymol. 1990; 185: 60-89Crossref PubMed Scopus (6006) Google Scholar). Mutant GyrA proteins were purified by the protocol used to purify the wild type GyrA protein (22Shea M.E. Hiasa H. J. Biol.

The final preparations of mutant GyrA proteins were greater than 97% homogeneous for a single band on an SDS-polyacrylamide gel (see Fig. 2A). Purified GyrA A-del and GyrA A-Ala were mixed with the wild type GyrB to reconstitute GyrA A-del gyrase and GyrA A-Ala gyrase, respectively.FIGURE 2A, SDS-PAGE analysis of mutant GyrA proteins.

GyrA59 gyrase no longer wraps the DNA strand and cannot catalyze the supercoiling reaction (11Kampranis S.C. Maxwell A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

However, GyrA59 gyrase is still capable of catalyzing decatenation and relaxation reactions. E. coli Topo I was purified as described previously (24Hiasa H. DiGate R.J. Marians K.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 2093-2099Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Limited Trypsinolysis of GyrA—Digestion of either the wild type or a mutant GyrA protein with trypsin was performed by a protocol similar to that developed by Reece and Maxwell (25Reece R.J. Maxwell A. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 19648-19653Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Briefly, reaction mixtures (50 μl) containing 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.0), 100 mm NaCl, 5 mm dithiothreitol, 10% (v/v) glycerol, 15 μg of either the wild type or a mutant GyrA protein, and 1 μg of trypsin (Sigma, St. Louis, MO) were incubated at 37 °C. At the indicated times, a portion (10-μl each) of the reaction mixtures was taken, mixed with the same volume of 10% SDS solution, and then heated at 100 °C for 5 min. Reaction products were analyzed by electrophoresis through 10% polyacrylamide gels containing 0.1% SDS. Gels were stained with Coomassie Brilliant Blue and photographed using an Eagle Eye II system (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA). Gyrase-induced Constraint of Supercoils in DNA (Wrapping Assay)—Form I′ DNA was prepared by incubating pBR322 form I DNA with E. coli Topo I. Form I′ DNA was used as a substrate in both the wrapping and supercoiling (described in the following section) assays. Reaction mixtures (20 μl) containing 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.0), 10 mm MgCl2, 100 μg/ml bovine serum albumin, 10% (v/v) glycerol, 0.1 pmol (as molecule) pBR322 form I′ DNA, and the indicated amounts (as tetramer) of either the wild type or a mutant gyrase were incubated at 37 °C for 10 min. Then, 50 fmol of E. coli Topo I was added to the reaction mixtures, and the incubation was continued at 37 °C for 30 min. SDS was added to 1% to terminate the reaction, and the reaction mixtures were further incubated at 37 °C for 5 min. EDTA and proteinase K were then added to 25 mm and 50 μg/ml, respectively, and the incubation was continued for an additional 15 min. The DNA products were purified by extraction of the reaction mixtures with phenol-chloroform (1:1, v/v) and analyzed by electrophoresis through vertical 1.2% agarose (Seakem; Cambrex Bio Science, Rockland, ME) gels (14 × 10 × 0.3 cm) at 2 V/cm for 15 h in a running buffer of 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.9 at 23 °C), 40 mm sodium acetate, and 1 mm EDTA (TAE buffer). Gels were stained with ethidium bromide and photographed using an Eagle Eye II system. Supercoiling Reaction—Standard supercoiling reaction mixtures (12.5 μl) contained 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.0), 10 mm MgCl2, 100 mm potassium glutamate, 10 mm dithiothreitol, 50 μg/ml bovine serum albumin, 1 mm ATP, 100 fmol (as molecule) of pBR322 form I′ DNA, and the indicated amounts (as tetramer) of either the wild type or a mutant gyrase, and reaction mixtures were incubated for 15 min at 37 °C. Reactions were terminated by the addition of EDTA to 25 mm, and the DNA products were analyzed as described in the previous section. ATP-independent Relaxation of Negatively Supercoiled Plasmid DNA—Reaction mixtures (12.5 μl) containing 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.0), 10 mm MgCl2, 100 mm potassium glutamate, 10 mm dithiothreitol, 50 μg/ml bovine serum albumin, 100 fmol (as molecule) of pBR322 form I DNA, and the indicated amounts (as tetramer) of either the wild type or a mutant gyrase were incubated at 37 °C for 30 min. Reactions were terminated by adding EDTA to 25 mm, and the DNA products were analyzed as described in the previous section. Decatenation of kDNA—Reaction mixtures (12.5 μl) contained 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.0), 10 mm MgCl2, 100 mm potassium glutamate, 10 mm dithiothreitol, 50 μg/ml bovine serum albumin, 1 mm ATP, 0.3 μg of kDNA, and the indicated amounts (as tetramer) of either the wild type or a mutant gyrase. Reaction mixtures were incubated at 37 °C for 30 min and terminated by adding EDTA to 25 mm. The DNA products were analyzed by electrophoresis through vertical 1.2% agarose gels (14 × 10 × 0.3 cm) at 2 V/cm for 12 h in TAE buffer. Gels were stained with ethidium bromide and photographed. Alterations of the GyrA-box—Structural studies have revealed two differences between E. coli GyrA and E. coli ParC CTDs (12Corbett K.D. Shultzaberger R.K. Berger J.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2004; 101: 7293-7298Crossref PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar, 13Ruthenburg A.J. Graybosch D.M. Huetsch J.C. Verdine G.L. J. Biol.

One is the presence of a GyrA-box, QRRGGKG (19Ward D. Newton A. Mol. Microbiol. 1997; 26: 897-910Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar), and the other is the fact that the ParC CTD possesses only five blades. However, some ParC CTDs possess six blades (14Hsieh T.-J. Farh L. Huang W.M. Chan N.-L. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 55587-55593Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar, 15Corbett K.D. Schoeffler A.J. Thomsen N.D. Berger J.M. J. Mol. Biol. 2005; 351: 545-561Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar). Thus, the GyrA-box turns out to be the only motif that is present in GyrA CTDs, but not in ParC CTDs. Unlike the GyrA-box in the Borrelia burgdorferi GyrA CTD (12Corbett K.D. Shultzaberger R.K. Berger J.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2004; 101: 7293-7298Crossref PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar), the GyrA-box in the E. coli GyrA CTD locates in a disordered loop, referred to as the “β-CA loop” (13Ruthenburg A.J. Graybosch D.M. Huetsch J.C. Verdine G.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 26177-26184Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). The presence of a Thr residue in the B. burgdorferi GyrA-box is likely to make it a rare case (15Corbett K.D. Schoeffler A.J. Thomsen N.D. Berger J.M. J. Mol. Biol. 2005; 351: 545-561Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar). The majority of GyrA CTDs, including the E. coli GyrA CTD, adopt an open β-pinwheel fold with their GyrA-boxes in a disordered β-CA loop. We hypothesized that the presence of a GyrA-box alters the interaction of the CTD with DNA and allows gyrase to wrap DNA around itself. To directly examine this possibility, we conducted a mutational analysis of the GyrA-box using the E. coli gyrase as a model enzyme. We constructed two mutant GyrA proteins: GyrA A-del and GyrA-Ala, which contain the deletion and Ala substitution of the entire GyrA-box, QRRGGKG (residues 560-566), respectively (Fig. 1). Chromatographic properties of these mutant GyrA proteins were identical to those of the wild type protein (data not shown) and limited trypsinolysis showed that both GyrA A-del and GyrA A-Ala were comprised of the same globular domains as the wild type GyrA (Fig. 2B). Thus, these alterations of the GyrA box did not appear to perturb the structural integrity of the GyrA protein. The GyrA-box Is Required for Gyrase-mediated Wrapping of DNA—First, we assessed the effect of the loss of the GyrA-box on gyrase-mediated wrapping of DNA. When positive supercoils are generated as a result of gyrase-mediated wrapping of DNA, negative supercoils must be generated in other regions of the DNA molecule to maintain the overall linking number. Addition of E. coli Topo I, which is capable of relaxing, negative, but not positive, supercoils, would result in the relaxation of negative supercoils, and the subsequent removal of proteins from the DNA would leave positive supercoils in the DNA (9Liu L.F. Wang J.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1978; 75: 2098-2102Crossref PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar, 10Liu L.F. Wang J.C. Cell. 1978; 15: 979-984Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar). Thus, by measuring the constraint of supercoils introduced in the DNA, we can directly determine the extent of gyrase-mediated wrapping of DNA. Form I′ DNA was bound by either the wild type or a mutant gyrase in the absence of ATP (Fig. 3). As expected, the wild type gyrase could wrap DNA around itself (Fig. 3, lanes 2 and 3). In contrast, no wrapping of DNA was detected when GyrA59 gyrase was bound to form I′ DNA (Fig. 3, lanes 4 and 5). We found that either GyrA A-del gyrase or GyrA A-Ala gyrase could not wrap DNA (Fig. 3, lanes 6-9). These results demonstrated that the GyrA-box was required for gyrase-mediated wrapping of DNA. The Loss of the GyrA-box Abolishes the Supercoiling Activity of Gyrase—Next, we examined the effect of the loss of the GyrA-box on the supercoiling activity of gyrase. The wild type gyrase was capable of catalyzing the supercoiling reaction efficiently, and 4 fmol (as tetramer) of the wild type enzyme was sufficient to completely supercoil 100 fmol (as molecule) of form I′ DNA (Fig. 4A, lane 4). Either the deletion or Ala substitution of the GyrA-box essentially abolished the supercoiling activity of gyrase (Fig. 4B). Based on the amounts of form I DNA produced by 1 fmol of the wild type gyrase (Fig. 4A, lane 2) and 64 fmol of either GyrA A-del gyrase (Fig. 4B, lane 6) or GyrA A-Ala gyrase (Fig. 4B, lane 12), the supercoiling activities of these mutant gyrases were at least 320-fold lower than that of the wild type gyrase. These results showed that the GyrA-box was essential for a gyrase-catalyzed supercoiling reaction. These results, together with those described in the previous section, showed that it was the presence of a GyrA-box that allowed gyrase to wrap DNA around itself and catalyze the supercoiling reaction. Both GyrA A-del gyrase and GyrA A-Ala gyrase exhibited extremely low levels of the supercoiling activity (Fig. 4B). It is possible that the final preparations of GyrA A-del and GyrA A-Ala were contaminated with a trace amount of the endogenous wild type GyrA protein. However, no supercoiling activity of GyrA59 gyrase was detected (Fig. 4A, lanes 7-12), although GyrA59, GyrA A-del, and GyrA A-Ala were expressed and purified in the same manner. Another possibility is that low levels of the supercoiling activity are intrinsic to these mutant gyrases. A mutant gyrase reconstituted with the amino-terminal 64-kDa tryptic fragment of the GyrA subunit, which lacks the majority of the CTD (Fig. 1), exhibits a low level of the supercoiling activity (25Reece R.J. Maxwell A. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 19648-19653Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 26Reece R.J. Maxwell A. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 3540-3546Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Thus, both GyrA A-del gyrase and GyrA A-Ala gyrase could possess low levels of the supercoiling activity. The Absence of the GyrA-box Does Not Affect Either the Relaxation or Decatenation Activity of Gyrase—It seemed possible that, as is the case with GyrA59 gyrase (11Kampranis S.C. Maxwell A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 14416-14421Crossref PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar), the inability of either GyrA A-del gyrase or GyrA A-Ala gyrase to wrap DNA around itself would affect its supercoiling activity but not relaxation and decatenation activities. It is also possible, although less likely, that the loss of the GyrA-box would affect not only the supercoiling but also the relaxation and decatenation activities of gyrase. To distinguish these possibilities, we examined the effect of the loss of the GyrA-box on the relaxation and decatenation activities of gyrase. The ATP-independent relaxation (Fig. 5) and ATP-dependent decatenation (Fig. 6) activities of these mutant gyrases were measured using pBR322 form I DNA and kDNA as a substrate, respectively. Both GyrA A-del gyrase and GyrA A-Ala gyrase were capable of relaxing the negatively supercoiled plasmid DNA (Fig. 5). The specific activity in the relaxation assay of either GyrA A-del gyrase or GyrA A-Ala gyrase was only slightly lower (<2-fold) than that of the wild type gyrase. The decatenation activity of either GyrA A-del gyrase or GyrA A-Ala gyrase was virtually identical to that of the wild type enzyme (Fig. 6). As expected, the wild type gyrase decatenated and supercoiled kDNA (Fig. 6, lanes 2-5). As a result, the majority of the DNA products were the supercoiled monomer DNA molecules (minicircles decatenated from kDNA). In contrast, the majority of minicircles decatenated by either GyrA A-del gyrase or GyrA A-Ala gyrase were relaxed, although small portions of kDNA were partially supercoiled (Fig. 6, lanes 6-13). These results coincided well with the results of the supercoiling assay shown in Fig. 4. These results demonstrated that the loss of the GyrA-box did not affect the relaxation and decatenation activities of gyrase. Thus, the GyrA-box was required only for its supercoiling activity.FIGURE 6Either the deletion or Ala substitution of the GyrA-box does not affect the decatenation activity of gyrase. The standard decatenation reaction mixtures containing 0.3 μg of kDNA and the indicated amounts (as tetramer) of either the wild type or a mutant gyrase were incubated and the DNA products were analyzed as described under “Materials and Methods.” Form I′ and form I indicate relaxed and supercoiled minicircle DNA decatenated from kDNA, respectively. wt, the wild type gyrase; A-del, GyrA A-del gyrase; A-Ala, GyrA A-Ala gyrase.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Despite the extensive amino acid sequence similarities between gyrase and Topo IV, the CTDs of the GyrA and ParC subunits were not considered homologous (1Wang J.C. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1996; 65: 635-692Crossref PubMed Scopus (2086) Google Scholar, 2Champoux J.J. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2001; 70: 369-413Crossref PubMed Scopus (2218) Google Scholar). It was long thought that the ability of the non-homologous GyrA CTD to bind to DNA makes gyrase a unique topoisomerase, which is capable of wrapping DNA about itself and catalyzing the supercoiling reaction (9Liu L.F. Wang J.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1978; 75: 2098-2102Crossref PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar, 10Liu L.F. Wang J.C.

A. 1996; 93: 14416-14421Crossref PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar). In contrast, footprinting experiments have demonstrated the binding of the ParC NTD, but not the ParC CTD, to DNA (18Peng H. Marians K.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 25286-25290Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). However, recent studies have revealed unexpected properties of the ParC CTD. Corbett et al. (12Corbett K.D. Shultzaberger R.K. Berger J.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2004; 101: 7293-7298Crossref PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar) have identified the significant structural similarities between the GyrA and ParC CTDs, as well as the ability of the ParC CTD to bind and bend DNA. These discoveries required the reexamination of the functional roles of the CTDs and the molecular basis of gyrase-mediated wrapping of DNA. Although GyrA CTDs possess six full blades and an intact GyrA box sequence, structures of B. burgdorferi and E. coli GyrA CTDs have revealed two distinct types of GyrA CTDs (12Corbett K.D. Shultzaberger R.K. Berger J.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2004; 101: 7293-7298Crossref PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar, 13Ruthenburg A.J. Graybosch D.M. Huetsch J.C. Verdine G.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 26177-26184Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). The GyrA-box in the B. burgdorferi GyrA CTD locates in an ordered loop, which closes the β-pinwheel fold into a circular structure. In contrast, the GyrA-box in the E. coli GyrA CTD locates in the disordered β-CA loop, and this CTD adopts an open β-pinwheel fold. The closed β-pinwheel fold of the B. burgdorferi GyrA CTD is likely to be an exception (13Ruthenburg A.J. Graybosch D.M. Huetsch J.C. Verdine G.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 26177-26184Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar, 15Corbett K.D. Schoeffler A.J. Thomsen N.D. Berger J.M. J. Mol. Biol. 2005; 351: 545-561Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar). The presence of a Thr residue in the B. burgdorferi GyrA box seems to play a critical role in closing the β-pinwheel fold. It has been shown that, in addition to the full-length GyrA protein as the functional catalytic subunit of gyrase, B. burgdorferi produces the GyrA CTD as an independent and functional 34-kDa DNA-binding protein (27Knight S.W. Samuels D.S. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 4875-4881Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). The closed β-pinwheel fold of the B. burgdorferi GyrA CTD might have evolved to accommodate its function as an independent protein. The majority of GyrA CTDs possess an open β-pinwheel fold, similar to that of the E. coli GyrA CTD (15Corbett K.D. Schoeffler A.J. Thomsen N.D. Berger J.M. J. Mol. Biol. 2005; 351: 545-561Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar). It is possible that the entire GyrA CTD, including the β-CA loop, would become ordered when it is docked with the rest of gyrase. Alternatively, the disordered β-CA loop, including the GyrA-box, becomes ordered upon the binding of the GyrA-box to the DNA strand, the G-segment, which stretches out from the catalytic domain. Conformations of two types of gyrases in the gyrase-DNA complex could be virtually identical. Because the 7-amino acid-long GyrA-box, QRRGGKG (19Ward D. Newton A. Mol. Microbiol. 1997; 26: 897-910Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar), is the only motif unique to the GyrA CTD, we hypothesized that the presence of a GyrA-box alters the interaction of the CTD with DNA and allows gyrase to wrap DNA around itself. Either the deletion or Ala substitution of the GyrA-box abolished the ability of E. coli gyrase to wrap DNA around itself (Fig. 3). These results demonstrated that, in fact, the GyrA-box was required for gyrase-mediated wrapping of DNA. How does the GyrA-box affect the gyrase-DNA interaction to cause the wrapping of DNA? Because the GyrA-box consists of basic amino acid residues, it seems reasonable to assume that the GyrA-box could directly bind to DNA, most likely the G-segment stretching out from the GyrA NTD. The observation that substitution of the GyrA-box with Ala residues abolished gyrase-mediated wrapping of DNA supported the notion that basic amino acid residues in the GyrA-box are essential. It is interesting to speculate that the binding of the GyrA-box to the G-segment coordinates the direction of the bending of the G-segment at both sides of the catalytic domain to ensure the wrapping of DNA. Subtle differences in the amino acid sequences of GyrA-boxes might determine the efficiency of gyrase-mediated DNA wrapping and thus the supercoiling activity of gyrase. Future studies on the structures of a gyrase and a gyrase-DNA complex are necessary to determine the exact nature of the GyrA-box-DNA interaction. The loss of the GyrA-box almost completely abolished the supercoiling activity (Fig. 4) of gyrase. In contrast, either the relaxation or decatenation activity of gyrase was not affected by the alterations of the GyrA-box (Figs. 5 and 6). Furthermore, a DNA cleavage assay showed that the quinolone sensitivity of either GyrA A-Ala gyrase or GyrA A-del gyrase were similar, if not identical, to those of the wild type gyrase (data not shown). Thus, the wrapping of DNA caused by the GyrA-box is critical only for the supercoiling activity of gyrase. The loss of supercoiling activity of gyrase coincided well with the observation that, unlike pET11-gyrA, neither pET11-gyrA A-del nor pET11-gyrA A-Ala could complement a temperature-sensitive phenotype of KNK453gyrAts (data not shown). These results suggest that the supercoiling activity, but not the relaxation and decatenation activities, of gyrase is required for its essential function in vivo. Emerging phylogenetic and structural data on gyrases and Topo IVs have brought a new picture of how bacterial type II topoisomerases likely evolved. Our finding that the deletion of the GyrA-box abolished the supercoiling activity without affecting the relaxation and decatenation activities of gyrase may have an important implication on the evolution of bacterial type II topoisomerases. It is suggested that the evolution of Topo IV from gyrase might have coincided with the progressive loss or alteration of structural features of the ParC CTD, concomitant with functional modification of the enzyme (15Corbett K.D. Schoeffler A.J. Thomsen N.D. Berger J.M. J. Mol. Biol. 2005; 351: 545-561Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar). In this scenario, the first step was the deletion of a GyrA-box. Our results indicate that this step abolished the supercoiling activity of a gyrase, but its relaxation and decatenation activities remained intact. Thus, the deletion of a GyrA-box resulted in the generation of a topoisomerase with two important properties. First, this topoisomerase lacked the supercoiling activity, and thus, it did not interfere with the essential function of gyrase. Second, this enzyme could catalyze both the relaxation and decatenation reactions, and thus, it could serve as a prototype of either relaxases or decatenases. E. coli Topo IV, an efficient decatenase (28Adams D.E. Shekhtman E.M. Zechiedrich E.L. Schmid M.B. Cozzarelli N.R.

Prompted by accumulating evidence for an oligomeric nature of Maguks, we examined the potential of SAP97 and PSD-95 to form heteromeric complexes. SAP97 and PSD-95 coimmunoprecipitated from rat brain detergent extracts and subsequent glutathione S-transferase pull-down and immunoprecipitation experiments showed that the interaction is mediated by binding of the N-terminal segment of SAP97 (SAP97NTD) to the Src homology 3 domain of PSD-95 (PSD-95SH3). In cultured hippocampal neurons, expression of green fluorescent protein-tagged PSD-95 triggered accumulation of SAP97 in synaptic spines, which was totally inhibited by coexpression of PSD-95SH3. Furthermore, overexpression of green fluorescent protein-PSD-95 induced dendritic clustering of GluR-A subunit-containing AMPA receptors, which was strongly inhibited by cotransfection with SAP97NTD and PSD-95SH3 constructs. Our results demonstrated a direct interaction between SAP97 and PSD-95 and suggested that this association may play a functional role in the trafficking and clustering of AMPA receptors.

Both SAP97 and PSD-95 participate in synaptic targeting of AMPA receptors, although the underlying molecular mechanisms are still poorly understood. SAP97 interacts directly with AMPA receptor subunit GluR-A (GluR1) (13.Leonard A.S. Davare M.A. Horne M.C. Garner C.C. Hell J.W. J. Biol.

Biochemical experiments indicate that Dlg proteins may form oligomers and multimers. SAP97 exists as dimers and possibly higher oligomers stabilized by N-terminal interactions (19.Nakagawa T.

More recently, an alternative mechanism involving palmitoylation of the N-terminal cysteines implicated earlier in disulfide formation has been proposed for PSD-95 multimerization (23.Christopherson K.S.

In epithelia, SAP97 has been reported to associate with CASK/mLin-2, a distantly related Maguk, via L27 domains in both proteins (24.Lee S. Fan S. Makarova O. Straight S. Margolis B. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2002; 22: 1778-1791Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar). Recent NMR and x-ray diffraction studies provide a detailed structural explanation for the ability of L27 domains to mediate formation of heterodimers (25.Feng W. Long J.F. Fan J.S. Suetake T.

In the present study, we examined the possibility that the two Dlg proteins implicated in AMPA receptor trafficking, SAP97 and PSD-95, may directly interact. We demonstrated that SAP97 and PSD-95 associate via binding of the N-terminal segment of SAP97 to the SH3 domain of PSD-95 and provided evidence for a role of this interaction in the synaptic transport of GluR-A-containing AMPA receptors. Materials—N-terminally GFP-tagged SAP97 in pEGFP-C1 vector and C-terminally GFP-tagged PSD-95 in pGW1-CMV vector were generous gifts from Dr. Craig Garner (Stanford University, Stanford, CA) and Dr. David Bredt (University of California, San Francisco, CA), respectively. Antiserum raised against the N-terminal residues 1–100 of SAP97 (anti-SAP97N) has been described (Cai et al. (14.Cai C. Coleman S.K. Niemi K. Keinänen K. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 31484-31490Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar)). Monoclonal antibody against PSD-95 was from Sigma. SAP97 and PSD-95 antibodies were specific for their respective Maguks in immunoblotting against recombinant SAP97, SAP102, PSD-95, and PSD-93 (see supplemental data, Fig. S1). Polyclonal IgG antibodies against Myc tag and GFP were obtained from AbCam (Cambridge, UK). Anti-His tag monoclonal antibody was from Qiagen, Hilden, Germany. Cy3-conjugated anti-mouse and anti-rabbit IgGs were from Jackson ImmunoResearch Europe, Cambridgeshire, UK. Anti-mouse-IgG-Alexa Fluor 488 was a product of Molecular Probes, Eugene, OR. Horseradish peroxidase-conjugated anti-mouse and anti-rabbit IgGs were from Amersham Biosciences. Rabbit antiserum against GluR-A C-terminal domain was raised in the Laboratory Animal Facility of Viikki Biocenter, University of Helsinki following standard procedures. Briefly, primary immunization was performed with 400 μg of purified GST fusion protein of GluR-A residues 827–907 in complete Freund's adjuvant. This was followed by three booster immunizations (at 3, 5, and 7 weeks after the primary immunization), each with 200 μg of protein in Freund's incomplete adjuvant. In immunofluorescence microscopy, GluR-A antiserum but not the cognate preimmune serum produced a bright somatodendritic staining of cultured hippocampal pyramidal cells, and in Western blots of transfected HEK293 cells, the antiserum was specific for the GluR-A subunit (see supplemental data, Fig. S2). DNA Constructs—For expression of GST fusion proteins, pGEX-BNH, a modified version of pGEX4-T3 (Amersham Biosciences), was used as a vector (14.Cai C. Coleman S.K. Niemi K. Keinänen K. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 31484-31490Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). GST fusion constructs for full-length of SAP97 and its N-terminal residues 2–100 (N1) and for the PDZ1–3 domains of SAP97 (residues 213–549) and PSD-95 (residues 54–399) have been described previously (14.Cai C. Coleman S.K. Niemi K. Keinänen K. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 31484-31490Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). The following derivatives of SAP97 and PSD-95 were amplified by PCR from plasmid templates encoding the full-length molecules and subcloned in pGEX-BNH: the entire N-terminal segment of SAP97 (NTD; residues 2–223), SH3-guanylate kinase segment of SAP97 (SH3-GK; residues 565–911), SAP97 lacking the N-terminal segment (SAP97ΔNTD; residues 224–911), full-length PSD-95 (residues 1–724), SH3-guanylate kinase segment of PSD-95 (SH3-GK; residues 432–724), SH3 domain of PSD-95 (residues 432–502), guanylate kinase domain of PSD-95 (GK; residues 531–724), and PSD-95 lacking the N-terminal segment (ΔN; residues 54–724). SAP97 constructs used in this study carry the I1b insert at the N-terminal segment (27.McLaughlin M. Hale R. Ellston D. Gaudet S. Lue R.A. Viel A. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 6406-6412Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). For mammalian cell expression, DNA fragments encoding the above described segments of SAP97 and PSD95 and PCR-generated SAP97 fragment coding for residues 101–223 (N2) were subcloned into pcDNA3.1(-) (Invitrogen) modified to carry sequences encoding an N-terminal c-Myc tag and/or a C-terminal His6 tag and into pEGFP-C1 (Clontech) for an N-terminal GFP tag. (For an outline of SAP97 and PSD-95 constructs, see supplemental data, Fig.S3.) Full-length SAP102 and PSD-93 were amplified by PCR from rat brain cDNA using appropriate primers and cloned into pcDNA3.1 derivative for expression as N-terminally Myc-tagged proteins. The correctness of the DNA sequences of all PCR products was verified by dideoxy sequencing. GST Pull-down Assays—GST fusion proteins were expressed in Escherichia coli BL21 and purified using glutathione-Sepharose (Amersham Biosciences) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Proteins were extracted from adult rat brain homogenates or from transfected HEK293 cells in 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 140 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm Na3V04, 1 mm NaF, and 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride (TNE buffer) containing 1% Triton X-100, centrifuged for 20 min at 20,000 × g, and incubated overnight at +4 °C with 10 μg of GST fusion protein bound to glutathione-Sepharose beads in a 1-ml total volume. Sepharose beads were collected by centrifugation, washed five times with 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 140 mm NaCl (TBS), containing 1% Triton X-100 and then washed twice with TBS, and finally eluted in SDS sample buffer and resolved by electrophoresis. After SDS-PAGE, the proteins were transferred to nitrocellulose, stained briefly with Ponceau S, and blocked by 5% nonfatted dry milk in TBS. Blots were incubated with anti-Myc (1:1000), anti-GFP (1:10000), or anti-His (1:200) for 16 h at +4 °C. Thereafter, the blots were washed with TBS and incubated (1 h, room temperature) with the anti-rabbit or anti-mouse IgG horseradish peroxidase conjugate (1:5000) and developed by using ECL Plus system (Amersham Biosciences). Cell Culture and Transfections—HEK293 cells were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 2 mm glutamine, 10% (v/v) fetal calf serum, penicillin (50 units/ml), and streptomycin (50 units/ml) at 37 °C under 5% CO2. HEK293 cells were transfected with SAP97 and PSD-95 expression plasmids by using calcium phosphate coprecipitation. The cells were harvested 36–48 h after transfection in TNE buffer and used for immunoprecipitations as described below. Primary hippocampal neurons were obtained from E17 mouse embryos. Hippocampi were dissected and digested with 0.25% trypsin for 15 min in Hanks' balanced salt solution. Cells were dissociated by back-and-forth pipetting with a fire-polished Pasteur pipette and plated at a density of 5 × 104 cells/cm2 on poly-d-lysine-coated 13-mm round glass coverslips in 24-well plates in serum-free Neurobasal medium supplemented with B27. After 4 days, half of the medium was replaced by glial cell-conditioned Neurobasal/B27. The cells were transfected after 10 days in vitro. The medium was changed to Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium/10 mm MgCl2 without serum (transfection medium). For each well, a total of 1–2 μg of plasmid DNA in 16 μl was mixed with 1.5 μl of 2.5 m CaCl2 and combined with 17.5 μl of 42 mm HEPES, pH 7.06, containing 274 mm NaCl, 10 mm KCl, 1.4 mm Na2HPO4, and 15 mm d-glucose (2× HEPES-buffered saline), and the solution was added dropwise to the cells. For cotransfections, equal amounts of each plasmid were used. After a fine precipitation had formed (20–40 min), the transfection medium was removed and replaced by Neurobasal/B27. The cells were analyzed 7 days later as described below. Immunoprecipitations—Detergent extracts were prepared from HEK293 cells or from cerebella of adult male Wistar rats by homogenizing the cells or tissue in 10 volumes of TNE buffer, after which Triton X-100 was added to a final concentration of 1% (w/v), and the suspension was mixed at +4 °C for 2 h followed by centrifugation at 20,000 × g for 20 min. One-ml aliquots of supernatant were incubated with the appropriate IgG (2 μg) or antiserum (2 μl) overnight at 4 °C, after which 20 μl of GammaBind G-Sepharose (Amersham Biosciences) was added, and the incubation was continued with gentle rotation for an additional 2 h. GammaBind-Sepharose beads were washed five times with TNE and twice with PBS and then finally suspended in 20 μl of SDS sample buffer, heated at +95 °C for 5 min, and centrifuged briefly. The supernatants were analyzed by SDS-PAGE followed by immunoblotting as described above for GST pull-downs. For control purposes, preimmune sera or a nonrelevant IgGs were used to replace the primary antibody in the precipitations. Immunostainings and Fluorescence Microscopy—Hippocampal neurons were fixed using warm 4% paraformaldehyde, 4% sucrose in PBS for 20 min and permeabilized in 0.2% Triton X-100 in PBS for 10 min, rinsed with PBS, and incubated for 2 h with4% bovine serum albumin, 2% goat serum, and 0.2% Triton X-100 (blocking solution; in PBS). The cells were then incubated with the primary antibodies/antisera overnight at +4 °C in the blocking solution. For colocalization studies, SAP97N antiserum (1:100) and anti-PSD-95 monoclonal antibody (1:400) were used. GluR-ACTD antiserum (1:400) was used for staining clusters of GluR-A-containing AMPA receptors in neurons. The stained cells were washed with 0.2% Triton X-100/PBS (3 × 10 min) and incubated with appropriate Cy3- (red) or Alexa Fluor 488 (green)-conjugated secondary antibodies (1:400). After mounting in glycerol-gelatin, epifluorescence was visualized using the ×40 objective at maximum resolution in an Olympus AX70 microscope equipped with fluorescein isothiocyanate (for Alexa Fluor 488 and GFP) and TRITC (for Cy3) filters and a charge-coupled device camera. The digital images were analyzed by using ImagePro 4.0 (Media-Cybernetics, Silver Spring, MD). Spines expressing endogenous SAP97 were counted from three largest caliber dendrites in 12 GFP-PSD-95 transfected or untransfected neurons. For quantitation of GluR-A clustering, 10–20 labeled neurons were chosen randomly from 3–4 independent transfection experiments. The intensity of clusters, defined as discrete spots with an average fluorescence of ≥10-fold higher than the background, was measured from one or two largest proximal dendrites. Student's unpaired t test was used for statistical analysis. SAP97 Associates with PSD-95 in Vivo and in Vitro—In immunoprecipitation analyses of rat brain proteins interacting with glutamate receptors, we consistently noticed coprecipitation of SAP97 and PSD-95. Anti-SAP97N, an antiserum raised against the unique N-terminal sequence (residues 1–100) of SAP97 (14.Cai C. Coleman S.K. Niemi K. Keinänen K. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 31484-31490Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar) but not the cognate preimmune serum, precipitated PSD-95, present as a 95/80-kDa PSD-95 doublet in immunoblots (Fig. 1A). Likewise, a 120-kDa SAP97 band was observed in immunoprecipitates generated by anti-PDS-95 IgG (Fig. 1A). The antibodies were specific for their respective Dlg proteins, as direct anti-PSD-95 blot of rat brain did not detect any 120-kDa species, nor was the 95/80-kDa PSD-95 band labeled by direct anti-SAP97N blot (Fig. 1A, input lanes). These findings indicate that SAP97 and PSD-95 are present in the same molecular complexes in rat brain. Coimmunoprecipitation results prompted us to examine the possibility that PSD-95 and SAP97 may actually directly interact to form heteromeric Maguk complexes. For this purpose, HEK293 cells were transfected for expression of Myc-tagged SAP97 (Myc-SAP97) and GFP-tagged PSD-95 (GFP-PSD-95), either singly or together, and cellular detergent extracts were analyzed for the presence of a binary complex. A 115-kDa GFP-PSD-95 band was observed in anti-Myc immunoprecipitates, whereas a 120-kDa Myc-SAP97 species was present in anti-GFP immunoprecipitates prepared from cotransfected cells. Untransfected or singly transfected cells did not produce either of the these bands, indicating that in cotransfected cells, SAP97 and PSD-95 exists as a complex (Fig. 1, B and C). Because SAP97 is also endogenously expressed in HEK293 cells, appearing as a 120-kDa species in anti-SAP97N immunoblots (result not shown), we next studied whether PSD-95 would associate with the native SAP97. Consistent with such an association, anti-SAP97N, but not the cognate preimmune serum, brought down GFP-PSD-95 from transfected cells (Fig. 1D). Mapping the PSD-95 Binding Site in SAP97—To identify the structural determinants responsible for binding of SAP97 to PSD-95, N-terminally Myc-tagged polypeptide fragments representing different parts of SAP97 were expressed in HEK293 cells with His-tagged PSD-95, and the association was analyzed by immunoprecipitations from cell extracts. As shown in Fig. 2A, full-length SAP97 as well as SAP97ΔSH3-GK immunoprecipitated together with PSD-95, whereas three SAP97 fragments devoid of the N-terminal segment, but covering the rest of the polypeptide, SAP97ΔNTD, PDZ1–3, and SH3-GK, were not precipitated by anti-His antibody. Consistent with this, SAP97NTD (residues 1–223) alone showed association with PSD-95, whereas a shorter N-terminal fragment, SAP97N1, comprising residues 1–100, including the L27 domain, did not coprecipitate with PSD-95 (Fig. 2A). Similar results were obtained when the same detergent extracts were immunoprecipitated with anti-Myc antibody; immunoblots with anti-His show association of PSD-95 with full-length SAP97, SAP97ΔSH3-GK and with SAP97NTD (Fig. 2B). These results demonstrate that the N-terminal segment of SAP97 is both necessary and sufficient for association with PSD-95. Mapping the SAP97 Binding Site in PSD-95—To identify the structures in PSD-95 that SAP97NTD interacts with, we used an approach similar to the one described above. HEK 293 cells were now transfected for expression of GFP-tagged full-length SAP97 together with Myc-tagged PSD-95 domains, and the cell lysates were analyzed by immunoprecipitation. When anti-Myc antibody was used to analyze GFP immunoprecipitates, deletion of the PSD-95 N terminus did not have any effect on association with SAP97, suggesting that N-terminal interactions similar to those described for homo-oligomerization of SAP97 and PSD-95 do not mediate association of SAP97 with PSD-95 (Fig. 3A). Remarkably, the SH3 segment of PSD-95 showed association with GFP-SAP97, whereas the PDZ1–3 and GK domains were not precipitated together with SAP97 (Fig. 3A). Surprisingly, considering the association of SH3 segment, PSD-95SH3-GK did not coprecipitate with SAP97 (Fig. 3A). The reason for this failure is likely to be technical because when the same extracts were subjected to anti-His immunoprecipitation followed by anti-GFP detection, both PSD-95SH3 and PSD-95SH3-GK were clearly present in the immunoprecipitates (Fig. 3B). In all other respects, the results were not affected by the selection of the precipitating versus detecting antibody (Fig. 3B). Based on this analysis, the SH3 segment of PSD-95 is sufficient for association with SAP97 in transfected HEK293 cells. GST Pull-down Analysis of SAP97-PSD-95 Interaction—To corroborate the immunoprecipitation results, we used GST pull-down assays to analyze the interaction. First, in good agreement with immunoprecipitation experiments, GFP-tagged PSD-95 was retained by GST fusions of SAP97 and SAP97NTD but not by SAP97N1 or SAP97SH3-GK3 (Fig. 4A). Interestingly, a weak interaction between GFP-PSD-95 with the GST fusion of SAP97PDZ1–3 segment was consistently noticed in GST pull-downs (Fig. 4A). The specificity and characteristics of this presumably low affinity interaction were not pursued further, however, in this study. Furthermore, GFP-tagged PSD-95SH3 bound to GST fusion of SAP97NTD but did not show any interaction with SAP97 lacking the NTD (Fig. 4B). In conclusion, in vitro interaction studies indicate that the N-terminal segment of SAP97 and the SH3 domain of PSD-95 are necessary and sufficient for an heteromeric interaction between these Dlg proteins in mammalian cells. SAP97-PSD-95 Interaction in Cultured Neurons—To obtain information on the physiological role of the interaction between SAP97 and PSD-95, we first examined the cellular distributions of the two Maguks in cultured hippocampal neurons by immunofluorescence microscopy. Strong somatodendritic labeling was observed for both proteins, PSD-95 also exhibiting prominent punctate staining in spine-like structures along the dendrites. In contrast, SAP97 immunoreactivity was more diffuse and confined outside of spines, although a small number of putative spines were stained for both SAP97 and PSD-95, in agreement with previous studies (18.Rumbaugh G. Sia G.M. Garner C.C. Huganir R.L. J. Neurosci. 2003; 23: 4567-4576Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 19.Nakagawa T. Futai K. Lashuel H.A. Lo I. Okamoto K. Walz T. Hayashi Y. Sheng M.

Interestingly, transfection of the neurons with GFP-tagged PSD-95 plasmid caused a marked change in the cellular distribution of endogenous SAP97, leading to accumulation of endogenous SAP97 in synaptic spines and coclustering with GFP-PSD-95 (Fig. 5B), consistent with an interaction between the two molecules. PSD-95-driven clustering of SAP97 is indicative of a direct or indirect interaction between these molecules. To characterize this finding further, neurons were transfected for expression of GFP-PSD-95 with or without PSD-95SH3, and the numbers of dendritic spines labeled by anti-SAP97N antiserum were counted. GFP-PSD-95 increased the clustering of SAP97 to spines by a factor of 3–4 in comparison with untransfected controls, and this effect was totally eliminated by PSD-95SH3 (Table 1, Fig. 6). The number of GFP-PSD-95 fluorescent spines was not affected by coexpression of the SH3 domain (Table 1).TABLE 1Number of SAP97 immunoreactive spines in transfected neurons Spines staining positive for SAP97 were counted from large dendrites in untransfected primary neurons and neurons transfected for expression of GFP-PSD-95 or GFP-PSD-95 together with Myc-tagged PSD-95SH3. The values represent arithmetic means ± S.E. (n = 36).

In agreement with earlier reports (17.El-Husseini A.E. Schnell E. Chetkovich D.M. Nicoll R.A. Bredt D.S. Science. 2000; 290: 1364-1368Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 29.Schnell E. Sizemore M.

The intensity of GluR-A clusters on the proximal dendrites of GFP-positive cells was on average 2.2 times higher than in the neighboring nontransfected cells (Table 2; Fig. 7A). Cotransfection with SAP97NTD abolished the GFP-PSD-95-induced clustering of GluR-A AMPA receptors entirely (Fig. 7B and Table 2). Furthermore, cotransfect"

We have used bimolecular fluorescence complementation and co-immunoprecipitation to show that a ubiquitous ER membrane protein (BAP31) interacts with P450 2C2 in transfected COS-1 cells. A chimera containing only the N-terminal signal anchor of P450 2C1 (P450 2C1-(1–29)) also interacted with BAP31, which is consistent with interaction of the two proteins via their transmembrane domains. Down-regulation of BAP31 expression with small interfering RNA resulted in redistribution of green fluorescent protein-tagged P450 2C2 or P450 2C1-(1–29) from the ER into the nuclear membrane and compact perinuclear compartment structures as well as the cell surface in a small fraction of the cells. In Bap31-null embryonic stem cells, a significant fraction of P450 2C2 or P450 2C1-(1–29) was detected at the cell surface and nuclear envelope, but was redistributed to the ER by expression of BAP31. The expression level of P450 2C2 was significantly increased in COS-1 cells with repressed levels of BAP31. Formation of the pro-apoptotic p20 fragment of BAP31 was detected in transfected COS-1 cells expressing P450 2C2, and annexin V staining was consistent with the activation of an apoptotic pathway in these cells. Down-regulation of BAP31 with small interfering RNA partially reversed the apoptosis. These results suggest that interaction of P450 2C2 with BAP31 is important for its ER retention and expression level and that BAP31 may be involved in the regulation of apoptosis induced by the ER overload response to increased expression of P450.

The mechanisms underlying direct retention of integral membrane proteins in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) 2The abbreviations used are: ER, endoplasmic reticulum; TMDs, transmembrane domains; YFP, yellow fluorescent protein; GFP, green fluorescent protein; BiFC, bimolecular fluorescence complementation; YC, C-terminal yellow fluorescent protein fragment; YN, N-terminal yellow fluorescent protein fragment; siRNA, small interfering RNA; ES, embryonic stem; FITC, fluorescein isothiocyanate.2The abbreviations used are: ER, endoplasmic reticulum; TMDs, transmembrane domains; YFP, yellow fluorescent protein; GFP, green fluorescent protein; BiFC, bimolecular fluorescence complementation; YC, C-terminal yellow fluorescent protein fragment; YN, N-terminal yellow fluorescent protein fragment; siRNA, small interfering RNA; ES, embryonic stem; FITC, fluorescein isothiocyanate. are not well understood. Whether specific retention signals are involved or whether the lack of positive transport (exit) signals underlies exclusion of these proteins from further transport out of the ER remains controversial. A positive signal is required for the rapid transport from the ER of many proteins because these proteins are more concentrated in the nascent transport vesicles and the rates of transport are ∼10-fold higher compared with proteins that do not contain known exit signals (1.Balch W.E. McCaffery J.M. Plutner H. Farquhar M.G. Cell. 1994; 76: 841-852Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (331) Google Scholar). The slow rate of transport of the latter proteins presumably represents bulk flow of membrane and luminal contents passively incorporated into the transport vesicle. A retention signal to prevent bulk flow must operate for proteins directly retained in the ER. The existence of an ER retention signal(s) implies that specific receptors recognizing these signals must be present in the ER compartment. For some ER membrane proteins, it has been shown that short motifs (RR at the N terminus or KKXX at the C terminus) mediate their ER retention and that this process involves receptor-mediated retrieval from a post-ER compartment (2.Lee M.C. Miller E.A. Goldberg J. Orci L. Schekman R. Annu. Rev. Cell Dev. Biol. 2004; 20: 87-123Crossref PubMed Scopus (687) Google Scholar, 3.Mancias J.D. Goldberg J. Traffic. 2005; 6: 278-285Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). Yet ER retention of KKXX-containing proteins is often unaffected by deletion or mutation of this signal, and most of the ER-specific membrane proteins do not contain any of the known retrieval signals. The transmembrane domains (TMDs) of many proteins are usually sufficient to retain a heterologous protein in the ER (4.Teasdale R.D. Jackson M.R. Annu. Rev. Cell Dev. Biol. 1996; 12: 27-54Crossref PubMed Scopus (440) Google Scholar), implying that they encode some retention signal, but a conserved motif with such a function has been not identified. Microsomal cytochromes P450 are integral ER membrane proteins inserted in the membranes via the N-terminal signal anchor sequence, which also functions as an ER retention signal (5.Murakami K. Mihara K. Omura T. J. Biochem. (Tokyo). 1994; 116: 164-175Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar, 6.Szczesna-Skorupa E. Kemper B. J. Biol.

In several P450s, such as P450 2C1, 2C2, and M1, the signal anchor sequence mediates direct retention in the ER (5.Murakami K. Mihara K. Omura T. J. Biochem. (Tokyo). 1994; 116: 164-175Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar, 6.Szczesna-Skorupa E. Kemper B. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 1757-1762Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), whereas in other microsomal P450s, retention in the ER involves recycling through the intermediate compartment (6.Szczesna-Skorupa E. Kemper B. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 1757-1762Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), and in some cases, P450 can be detected in the Golgi and plasma membrane (8.Eliasson E. Kenna J.G. Mol. Pharmacol. 1996; 50: 573-582PubMed Google Scholar, 9.Neve E.P. Eliasson E. Pronzato M.A. Albano E. Marinari U. Ingelman-Sundberg M. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1996; 333: 459-465Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). These differences may result from heterogeneity of the length and sequence of P450 signal anchors, but despite extensive studies, the specific signal encoded by these sequences or the mechanism of ER retention is not known. In addition to the signal anchor, the cytoplasmic domain of P450 2C2 is also excluded from vesicular transport when inserted into the ER membrane by a heterologous signal anchor sequence (10.Szczesna-Skorupa E. Ahn K. Chen C.D. Doray B. Kemper B. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 24327-24333Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar), suggesting that this domain contains a redundant ER retention signal. Microsomal P450s do not contain any of the known ER retention/retrieval signals, and it is not known whether their targeting and retention in the smooth ER involve a specific receptor. High concentrations of P450s in the ER attained by drug-mediated induction would require high concentrations of any specific receptor to prevent their transport out of the ER by bulk flow. Induction of microsomal P450s also leads to proliferation of the smooth ER compartment, a process that activates both ER stress and ER overload responses in a time-dependent fashion (11.Szczesna-Skorupa E. Chen C.D. Liu H. Kemper B. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 13953-13961Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar, 12.Ohkuma M. Park S.M. Zimmer T. Menzel R. Vogel F. Schunck W.H.

The balance between the two signaling pathways determines whether accumulation of P450 is accommodated by expansion of the ER membrane compartment or whether the severity of the stress induces apoptosis in these cells (11.Szczesna-Skorupa E. Chen C.D. Liu H. Kemper B. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 13953-13961Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). These processes must be mediated by multiple interactions of P450 with folding chaperones, quality control components, and signaling proteins of the ER. Moreover, formation of an enzymatically active P450 requires not only proper folding of P450 and its redox partners, but also homo- or hetero-oligomerization among these proteins (15.Backes W.L. Kelley R.W. Pharmacol. Ther. 2003; 98: 221-233Crossref PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar), processes that may require chaperone actions. Thus, it is likely that microsomal P450s are involved in many interactions with multiple components of the ER membrane. Recent studies indicate that a ubiquitous and evolutionary conserved protein (BAP31) is involved in the quality control and regulation of intracellular trafficking and ER retention/exit of some membrane proteins. BAP31 is a polytopic integral ER membrane protein, and it forms a hetero-oligomeric complex with a closely related protein, BAP29 (16.Ng F.W. Nguyen M. Kwan T. Branton P.E. Nicholson D.W.

Cell Biol. 1997; 139: 1397-1410Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar). In addition, BAP31 interacts with proteins that regulate apoptosis (procaspase-8 and Bcl-2), cytoskeleton components, and the ER chaperone calnexin, which implicates BAP31 in the regulation of multiple cellular pathways originating in the ER (16.Ng F.W.

In its full-length form, it has anti-apoptotic activity, but a caspase cleavage product of BAP31 (a transmembrane fragment called p20) promotes apoptosis (16.Ng F.W. Nguyen M. Kwan T. Branton P.E.

It has been suggested that BAP31 has some role in the ER membrane architecture because it associates with the cytoskeletal components actin and myosin (30.Ducret A. Nguyen M. Breckenridge D.G. Shore G.C. Eur. J. Biochem. 2003; 270: 342-349Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). Because of its role in ER retention of several membrane proteins, it seemed possible that BAP31 might be involved in ER retention of P450. In this study, we show that BAP31 interacts with P450 2C2 in the ER of transfected cells and that reduction of BAP31 levels affects the subcellular localization and accumulation of P450 and apoptosis in response to increased P450 in the ER membrane. Materials—Tissue culture materials were purchased from Invitrogen; the pEGFP-N1 vector was from Clontech; and Tran35S-label from MP Biomedicals. The yellow fluorescent protein (YFP) fragments encoding plasmids pBiFCYN and pBiFCYC were kindly provided by Dr. T. Kerpolla (University of Michigan, Ann Arbor, MI). Antibodies against green fluorescent protein (GFP) and GM130 were from Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc. and BD Biosciences, respectively, and rhodamine-conjugated anti-mouse antibody was obtained from Jackson ImmunoResearch Laboratories, Inc. For BAP31 detection, either anti-BAP31 antibody (kindly supplied by Dr. Gordon Shore, McGill University, Montreal, Canada) or a commercial antibody against BAP31 (Affinity BioReagents) was used.

Plasmids encoding bimolecular fluorescence complementation (BiFC) chimeras P450 2C2/YC (where YC is a C-terminal YFP fragment), P450 2C2/YN (where YN is an N-terminal YFP fragment), P450 2C1-(1–29)/YC, and P450 2C1-(1–29)/YN were constructed as described (32.Ozalp C.

Dispos. 2005; 33: 1382-1390Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). cDNA clones of BAP31 and BAP29 (pDNR vectors) were obtained from American Type Culture Collection. To construct BAP31/YN and BAP31/YC, BAP31 was amplified by PCR with the 5′-primer 5′-TACGTAGGTACCATGAGTCTGCAGTGGACTGCAGTT-3′ and the 3′-primer 5′-TGATAGGATCCTTCTCTTCCTTCTTGTCCATGGGACCATCTAC-3′, introducing KpnI and BamHI sites, respectively. The PCR products were digested with KpnI and BamHI and ligated to the YN and YC vectors digested with the same enzymes. The same strategy was used for construction of BAP29/YN and BAP29/YC using the 5′-primer 5′-CATGGGTACCAAAATGACACTCCAATGG-3′ and the 3′-primer 5′-GACAGGATCCTTCAGTCTTTTCTTGTTGCC-3′. To construct untagged BAP31 in the pCMV vector, BAP31 cDNA was amplified by PCR with the 5′-primer 5′-TACGTAGGTACCATGAGTCTGCAGTGGACTGCAGTT-3′ and the 3′-primer 5′-AGAGGATCCTTACTCTTCCTTCTTGTC-3′. The PCR product was digested with KpnI and BamHI and inserted into the KpnI-BamHI site of pCMV5. To construct the vector pSUPER/T1 expressing BAP31 small interfering RNA (siRNA), pSUPER DNA (OligoEngine) was digested with KpnI and Hin-dIII and ligated to annealed 64-mers encoding the RNA target sequence 5′-GAAGUACAUGGAGGAGAAU-3′. Cell Culture and Transfection—COS-1 cell culture, transfection with Lipofectamine 2000 reagent, biosynthetic labeling of the transfected cells, immunoprecipitation, and Western blotting were done as described (6.Szczesna-Skorupa E.

Apoptosis Assay—Apoptosis in transfected cells was assayed 48 h after transfection using the fluorescein isothiocyanate (FITC)-conjugated annexin V apoptosis detection kit (BioVision Inc.) following the manufacturer's protocol. BiFC Analysis by Flow Cytometry and Fluorescence Microscopy—For BiFC analysis by fluorescence microscopy, cells were grown on coverslips in 6-well plates; and 18–20 h after transfection, the cells were incubated for 5 h at 30 °C and imaged with a Zeiss LSM510 confocal microscope using YFP excitation at 514 nm and detection at 535–545 nm as described (32.Ozalp C.

For flow cytometry, 18–20 h after transfection, cells were incubated for 5 h at 30°C, gently trypsinized, washed with Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium, and resuspended in 1 ml of Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium. The cells were analyzed with a Coulter Epics XL-MCL flow cytometer using an excitation wavelength of 488 nm and Summit Version 3.1 software (Cytomation, Inc.) as described (32.Ozalp C. Szczesna-Skorupa E. Kemper B. Drug Metab. Dispos. 2005; 33: 1382-1390Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). Only cells exhibiting forward and side scatter typical of live cells were included in the analysis. A threshold fluorescence intensity was selected such that <1% of the control cells (mock-transfected or expressing a chimera with YN or YC only) were above the threshold. The percentage of cells above the threshold and the average intensity of these cells were determined for the experimental samples. Analysis of BAP31 Interaction with Cytochrome P450 2C2 by BiFC— The BiFC assay is based on recombination of the non-fluorescent N-terminal (YN) and C-terminal (YC) fragments of YFP to produce a fluorescent protein (34.Hu C.D.

The interaction between two proteins can be analyzed by coexpressing in cells chimeras of one protein fused to YN and the other protein to YC. If the two proteins interact with each other, YC and YN are brought together and irreversibly recombine to form fluorescent YFP, whereas if the two proteins do not interact, fluorescence is not observed. The interaction between YN and YC does not contribute to the potential interaction between the chimeric proteins (34.Hu C.D. Chinenov Y. Kerppola T.K. Mol. Cell. 2002; 9: 789-798Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1169) Google Scholar). The intensity of the fluorescence resulting from BiFC is dependent on both the affinity of the interaction of the two proteins and the relative positions of the two YFP fragments in the protein complex. The intensity of fluorescence therefore does not directly correlate with the strength of the protein interaction, particularly if the interaction of two proteins of differing sizes, such as P450 2C2 and its N-terminal fragment P450 2C1-(1–29), with a third protein is studied. We have recently used BiFC to detect oligomerization of P450 2C2 and its interaction with P450 reductase in live cells (32.Ozalp C. Szczesna-Skorupa E. Kemper B. Drug Metab. Dispos. 2005; 33: 1382-1390Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). A fluorescent signal was generated in the ER of cells transfected with chimeras of P450 2C2 or its 29-amino acid N-terminal signal anchor sequence attached to YN and YC, consistent with oligomerization of P450 2C2 mediated by its N-terminal signal anchor sequence. Here, we used these P450 2C2 chimeras to detect potential interactions of P450 2C2 with BAP31 tagged at its C terminus with the YFP fragments. We have shown previously that the ER membrane localization and topology of either full-length P450 2C2 or its N-terminal signal anchor only are not affected by attaching GFP or YFP to the C terminus (31.Szczesna-Skorupa E. Chen C.D. Rogers S. Kemper B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 14793-14798Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). However, BAP31 contains aKKXX ER retention signal at its C terminus (16.Ng F.W. Nguyen M. Kwan T. Branton P.E. Nicholson D.W. Cromlish J.A. Shore G.C. J. Cell Biol. 1997; 139: 327-338Crossref PubMed Scopus (285) Google Scholar, 17.Adachi T. Schamel W.W.A. Kim K.M. Watanabe T. Becker B. Nielsen P.J. Reth M. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 1534-1541Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). Although mutation of the KKXX sequence does not alter the ER distribution of BAP31 (18.Schamel W.W.A. Kuppig S. Becker B. Gimborn K. Hauri H.-P. Reth M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2003; 100: 9861-9866Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar), it was still important to establish that attachment of YN or YC to the C terminus does not affect its ER retention. Immunofluorescence of COS-1 cells transfected with untagged BAP31 (BAP31/cytomegalovirus) and detected with anti-BAP31 antibody showed the expected ER localization (Fig. 1B). A similar pattern of fluorescence was observed in cells transfected with BAP31/YN and detected with an antibody against GFP that recognizes YN (Fig. 1A), indicating that attachment of the YFP fragment does not affect BAP31 ER retention. Cotransfection of untagged BAP31 (Fig. 1B) and P450 2C2/GFP (Fig. 1C) showed the expected co-localization of these proteins in the ER compartment (Fig. 1D). As a positive control for the BiFC assay, we cotransfected cells with chimeras P450 2C1-(1–29)/YN and P450 2C1-(1–29)/YC. In these cells, strong fluorescence was detected in a pattern consistent with ER membrane localization of the P450 chimeras that homo-oligomerize (Fig. 1E). Cotransfection of COS-1 cells with BAP31/YN and P450 2C2/YC also generated yellow fluorescence in live cells in a typical ER pattern (Fig. 1G), indicating that these proteins interacted in this compartment. To test whether the interaction of P450 2C2 with BAP31 is mediated by the TMD of P450 in the N-terminal signal anchor sequence, as has been shown for other proteins (17.Adachi T. Schamel W.W.A. Kim K.M. Watanabe T. Becker B. Nielsen P.J. Reth M. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 1534-1541Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar, 18.Schamel W.W.A. Kuppig S. Becker B. Gimborn K. Hauri H.-P. Reth M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2003; 100: 9861-9866Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar), we used the chimera P450 2C1-(1–29)/YC. In cells transfected with BAP31/YN and P450 2C1-(1–29)/YC, a fluorescence intensity and pattern of distribution similar to those for BAP31/YN and full-length P450 2C2/YC were seen (Fig. 1F), consistent with the interaction of P450 with BAP31 being mediated by the 29-amino acid N-terminal signal anchor sequence. For both chimeras, a pattern of reconstituted YFP fluorescence in an ER-like distribution was observed in most cells, and a distribution of fluorescence characteristic of Golgi or plasma membrane localization was not detected in any cells. These results indicate that the P450 2C2/YC and BAP31/YN interaction occurs within the ER network. The interaction of some proteins with BAP31 requires a heterodimer of BAP31 with its partner BAP29 (18.Schamel W.W.A. Kuppig S. Becker B. Gimborn K. Hauri H.-P. Reth M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2003; 100: 9861-9866Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar, 27.Breckenridge D.G. Stojanovic M. Marcellus R.C. Shore G.C. J. Cell Biol. 2003; 160: 1115-1127Crossref PubMed Scopus (459) Google Scholar). To determine whether increased expression of BAP29 would enhance the BAP31-P450 2C2 interaction, we also tested the effect of coexpressing BAP29/YN in transfected cells. No enhancement of fluorescence intensity was observed in cells when BAP29/YN was cotransfected with P450 2C2/YC and BAP31/YN (Fig. 1H), which suggests that BAP29 is not required for complex formation between BAP31 and P450 2C2. However, it remains possible that BAP29 is part of the BAP31 complex with P450 2C2, but that saturating amounts of endogenous BAP29 mask any effects of exogenously expressed BAP29. The interaction of P450 2C2 and BAP31 was further studied by detection of BiFC with flow cytometry, which analyzes a large population of transfected cells rather than individual cells as is done by confocal microscopy. As a negative control, cells transfected with only one YFP fragment chimera (P450 2C1-(1–29)/YC, P450 2C1-(1–29)/YN, or BAP31/YN) were analyzed, and a threshold of fluorescence was chosen such that 0.1% of the control cells were above the threshold (Fig. 2A). As a positive control, we again measured the fluorescence of live cells expressing the YC and YN chimeras of P450 2C1-(1–29), which are known to homo-oligomerize. As expected, in these cells, BiFC was detected in 22% of the cells above the threshold fluorescence (Fig. 2B). For cells cotransfected with BAP31/YN and either full-length P450 2C2/YC or P450 2C1-(1–29)/YC, BiFC was detected in 19 and 21%, respectively, of the cells above the threshold fluorescence (Fig. 2, C and D). The detection of BiFC by both confocal microscopy and flow cytometry indicated that BAP31 and P450 2C2 interact and that the interaction is mediated predominantly by the N-terminal signal anchor of P450 2C2. To test whether P450 2C2 association with BAP31 is related to its direct ER retention, we also analyzed BAP31 binding to the chimera P450 2C1-(1–21)/YC, which contains only the TMD of the signal anchor sequence without the juxtamembrane linker residues 22–29. P450 2C1-(1–21)/GFP was shown in our previous study (35.Szczesna-Skorupa E. Kemper B. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 19409-19415Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar) to be transported from the ER and retained by the retrieval pathway rather than directly retained in the ER. Although BiFC was detected in cells transfected with BAP31/YN and P450 2C1-(1–21)/YC (Fig. 2E), only 7.3% of the cells were above the threshold compared with 21% for P450 2C1-(1–29)/YC, suggesting a weaker interaction of P450 2C1-(1–21)/YC with BAP31/YN. Similar results were obtained when BiFC was detected by confocal microscopy (data not shown). Optimal binding of P450 2C2 to BAP31 thus requires both the TMD (residues 1–20) and linker region (residues 21–29) of the signal anchor sequence. The interaction between BAP31 and P450 2C2 was also analyzed by co-immunoprecipitation. COS-1 cells were transfected with P450 2C1-(1–29)/YN and BAP31 and labeled 24 h later with Tran35S-label for 2 h. Equal amounts of cell lysates were then immunoprecipitated with an antibody against either BAP31 or GFP (which recognizes YN in P450 2C1-(1–29)/YN). BAP31 was co-immunoprecipitated with anti-GFP antibody; and conversely, anti-BAP31 antibody coprecipitated P450 2C1-(1–29)/YN (Fig. 3). In both cases, only a fraction of the proteins coprecipitated compared with the amount of protein precipitated with the homologous antisera. Similar results were obtained with full-length P450 2C2 (data not shown). This suggests either that the interaction is not completely stable"

The activity of single neurons in the IT cortex was recorded while the monkeys performed a sequential-type associative memory task in which distractor stimuli interrupted the delay epoch between the cue and target (paired-associate) stimuli. For each neuron, information about each stimulus conveyed by the delay activity was estimated as a coefficient of multiple regression analysis. We found that target information derived from long-term memory (LTM) persisted despite the distractors. By contrast, cue information derived from the visual system was attenuated and frequently replaced by distractor information. These results suggest that LTM-derived information required for upcoming behavior is actively maintained in the IT neurons, whereas visually derived information tends to be updated irrespective of behavioral relevance.

These results suggest that LTM-derived information required for upcoming behavior is actively maintained in the IT neurons, whereas visually derived information tends to be updated irrespective of behavioral relevance. We can selectively retrieve a specific internal representation of an object from the enormous stores present in our long-term memory (LTM) and actively retain it in mind until the information is used (Anderson, 1995Anderson J.R. Cognitive Psychology and Its Implications. W.H. Freeman and Company, New York, NY1995Google Scholar, Fuster, 1995Fuster J.M. Memory in the Cerebral Cortex. MIT Press, Cambridge, MA1995Google Scholar). These internal representations are known to be constructed by neurons that have highly specific stimulus selectivity (Fuster, 1995Fuster J.M. Memory in the Cerebral Cortex. MIT Press, Cambridge, MA1995Google Scholar, Rolls and Deco, 2002Rolls E.T. Deco G. Computational Neuroscience of Vision. Oxford University Press, Oxford2002Google Scholar). Moreover, some of these neurons not only show selective responses during presentation of a stimulus but also retain the selective neuronal activity after removal of that stimulus (Miyashita, 1993Miyashita Y.

It is an attractive hypothesis that these neurons with sustained activity can be involved in the neuronal network that actively maintains internal representations (Wang, 2001Wang X.J.

Previous studies have shown that neurons in the inferior temporal (IT) cortex, which is the final stage of the ventral visual pathway, respond selectively to particular visual objects and also show selective delay activity (Miyashita and Chang, 1988Miyashita Y.

Vogels R. Orban G.A. Selectivity for 3D shape that reveals distinct areas within macaque inferior temporal cortex.Science. 2000; 288: 2054-2056Crossref PubMed Scopus (178) Google Scholar). The participation of the IT neurons in active networks maintaining internal representations has been investigated with a delayed matching-to-sample (DMS) task, during which subjects need to retain information about a sample stimulus until that stimulus reappears as a target (Miller et al., 1993Miller E.K. Li L. Desimone R. Activity of neurons in anterior inferior temporal cortex during a short-term memory task.J. Neurosci. 1993; 13: 1460-1478PubMed Google Scholar, Yakovlev et al., 1998Yakovlev V.

Neurosci. 1998; 1: 310-317Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). It was found that during this task, sample-selective delay activity could be disrupted by intervening stimuli (Miller et al., 1993Miller E.K. Li L. Desimone R. Activity of neurons in anterior inferior temporal cortex during a short-term memory task.J. Neurosci. 1993; 13: 1460-1478PubMed Google Scholar). Disruption of delay activity was also detected in the posterior parietal (PP) cortex with a delayed matching-to-place (DMP) task (Constantinidis and Steinmetz, 1996Constantinidis C. Steinmetz M.A. Neuronal activity in posterior parietal area 7a during the delay periods of a spatial memory task.J. Neurophysiol. 1996; 76: 1352-1355PubMed Google Scholar). On the other hand, sample-selective delay activity was maintained in the prefrontal (PF) and medial temporal (entorhinal or ERh) cortices despite presentation of a distractor (di Pellegrino and Wise, 1993di Pellegrino G. Wise S.P. Visuospatial versus visuomotor activity in the premotor and prefrontal cortex of a primate.J. Neurosci. 1993; 13: 1227-1243PubMed Google Scholar, Miller et al., 1996Miller E.K.

Miller E.K. Desimone R. Object and place memory in the macaque entorhinal cortex.J. Neurophysiol. 1997; 78: 1062-1081PubMed Google Scholar). However, the delay activity during a DMS task may be modulated by sensory trace of a sample stimulus that passively sustains after its presentation as well as by active memory of a matching target stimulus that emerges through task requirement, and both the stimuli in the DMS task are physically identical. Thus, it is difficult for the DMS task to properly assess the contribution made by the stimulus-selective IT neurons to an active network maintaining internal representations. A delayed pair-association (DPA) task is more suitable for that purpose. In a DPA task, a cue stimulus and its paired associate (target stimulus) are presented with a delay interval in between. Unlike the matching stimulus of a DMS task, the paired associate of a DPA task is recalled from LTM, so there is no sensory trace of the paired associate during the delay interval. To solve the task, it is necessary to retain the information about the cue stimulus derived from visual perception and/or information about the target stimulus derived from LTM (Rainer et al., 1999Rainer G. Rao S.C. Miller E.K. Prospective coding for objects in primate prefrontal cortex.J. Neurosci. 1999; 19: 5493-5505PubMed Google Scholar, Murray and Richmond, 2001Murray E.A. Richmond B.J. Role of perirhinal cortex in object perception, memory, and associations.Curr. Opin. Neurobiol. 2001; 11: 188-193Crossref PubMed Scopus (248) Google Scholar). Our previous studies have revealed that the delay activity in a single IT neuron carries both of these: “cue holding” and/or “target recall” (Sakai and Miyashita, 1991Sakai K. Miyashita Y. Neural organization for the long-term memory of paired associates.Nature. 1991; 354: 152-155Crossref PubMed Scopus (525) Google Scholar, Naya et al., 2001Naya Y. Yoshida M. Miyashita Y.

Neurosci. 2003; 18: 2915-2918Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). The cue-holding delay activity correlates with the activity elicited by the cue stimulus, whereas the target-recall delay activity correlates with the activity elicited by the target stimulus. The purpose of the present study was to investigate whether these two types of information are lost by an intervening visual distractor or whether they survive beyond it. We trained monkeys to perform a sequential-type DPA task in which distractor stimuli were presented sequentially during the delay epoch between presentation of a cue stimulus and presentation of a target stimulus. We found that as compared with perception-derived information about the cue stimulus, LTM-derived information about the forthcoming target stimulus was resistant to the presentation of the intervening distractor stimuli and survived through the delay epoch. Our findings suggest that IT neurons contribute to the active network retaining LTM-derived information about an object. We made single-unit recordings from neurons in the IT cortices of two macaque monkeys during a DPA task in which the delay epoch was interrupted by intervening distractor stimuli (Figure 1). We recorded 179 neurons (111 from monkey U; 68 from monkey T) that selectively responded to a visual cue stimulus (“cue-selective neurons”; analysis of variance [ANOVA] during cue period, p < 0.01). Of these cue-selective neurons, 59 neurons (37 from monkey U; 22 from monkey T) showed significant stimulus-selective delay activity before presentation of the first test stimulus (“delay-selective neurons”; ANOVA during first delay period, p < 0.01). Some of the delay-selective neurons exhibited stimulus-selective discharge during the first delay period that reflected the immediately preceding cue stimuli. The activity of a neuron exhibiting this “cue-holding” activity is depicted in Figure 2. Figure 2A shows the neuronal discharge elicited when the most preferred (optimal) picture was presented as the cue stimulus (58.8 ± 3.6 Hz [mean ± SEM] during cue period, 6.9 ± 1.1 Hz during fixation period). During trials in which the optimal picture was presented as the cue stimulus (optimal trials), this neuron also showed strong discharge during the first delay period (14.1 ± 1.1 Hz). This sustained discharge was attenuated, however, when a distractor stimulus was presented; consequently, neuronal discharge was significantly lower during the subsequent second delay period (6.3 ± 0.9 Hz) than during the first delay period (ANOVA during the fixation, cue, first delay, second delay periods, F(3, 42) = 192.46, p < 0.01 and Tukey test at p < 0.05) (Figure 2C, top). Figure 2B shows the neuronal discharge elicited when the paired associate of the optimal picture was presented as the cue stimulus (optimal-pair picture). In trials in which the optimal-pair picture was presented as a cue stimulus (optimal-pair trials), neuronal discharge was weak through the fixation, cue, first delay and second delay periods (6.0 ± 0.7 Hz, 14.1 ± 4.6 Hz, 8.0 ± 1.1 Hz, and 6.0 ± 1.2 Hz, respectively); however, only the discharge during the cue period was significantly higher than that during the fixation period (ANOVA during these four periods, F(3, 33) = 17.76, p < 0.01, Tukey test at p < 0.05) (Figure 2C, top). Next, we examined the response selectivity among all 24 stimuli in each period. The response selectivity was significant during both delay periods but was attenuated after the distractor presentation (Figure 2C) (ANOVA during first delay period, F(23, 148) = 7.24, p < 0.01; during second delay period, F(23, 148) = 2.58, p < 0.01). Post-hoc analysis revealed that during the first delay period, the activity elicited by the optimal stimulus was significantly higher than the activities elicited by any other 23 stimuli (Tukey test, p < 0.05). However, during the second delay period, the activity elicited by the optimal stimulus was significantly higher than the activities elicited by other two stimuli. This result again indicates that the selectivity during the delay interval of the neuron in Figure 2 was weaker after the distractor presentation. Figure 2D shows trial-to-trial neuronal discharges sorted by the cue stimulus. As could be seen in the optimal trials (upper side of pair number 10), neuronal discharges during the first delay period correlated with those during the cue period. During the second delay period, sustained discharge was observed in the trials in which there were strong visual responses during the presentation of the distractors (first test period), implying that neuronal discharge during the second delay period is influenced by discharge during the first test period (see also Figure 2C, black and gray bars). To examine the relationship between the visual responses during the first test period and discharge during the second delay period in more detail, we sorted the trial-to-trial neuronal activity by the distractor stimulus presented during the first test period (Figure 2E). In the trials in which distractor stimuli induced selective responses during the first test period (ANOVA, F(23, 148) = 24.53, p < 0.01), we observed selective discharge in the subsequent second delay period, (ANOVA, F(23, 148) = 2.30, p < 0.01), especially in the trials in which the optimal picture was presented as the distractor (Figure 2E, upper side of pair number 10). This means that in this neuron, the activity during the second delay period was also influenced by the distractor stimulus. We also found another type of delay-selective neuron in which stimulus-selective discharge during the first delay period was related to the neuronal activity elicited by the target stimulus (the paired-associate of the cue stimulus). Figure 3 depicts the behavior of a neuron with this “target-recall” activity. In contrast to the neuron with cue-holding activity shown in Figure 2, the optimal picture did not elicit the significantly higher discharges through the delay epoch than that during the fixation period though the discharge during the cue period was significantly higher than other periods (Figure 3A) (2.7 ± 0.8 Hz during fixation period, 33.3 ± 1.3 Hz during cue period, 3.5 ± 0.7 Hz during first delay period, 2.9 ± 0.9 Hz during second delay period; ANOVA during these four periods, F(3, 42) = 256.91, p < 0.01, Tukey test at p < 0.05). In optimal-pair trials, visual responses were not observed during the cue period, but the firing rate increased significantly during the first delay period (Figure 3B) (3.6 ± 0.7 Hz during fixation period, 4.7 ± 1.4 Hz during cue period, 12.9 ± 1.7 Hz during first delay period). When a distractor stimulus was presented during the first test period, the neuronal discharge transiently dropped but then rapidly recovered to a level comparable to that seen during the first delay period (12.0 ± 1.3 Hz during second delay period; ANOVA, F(3, 30) = 13.98, p < 0.01 and Tukey test at p < 0.05) (Figure 2C, top). Examination of the response selectivity among the 24 stimuli showed that this neuron responded selectively during both the first and second delay periods (Figure 3C) (ANOVA during first delay period, F(23, 150) = 11.49, p < 0.01; during second delay period, F(23, 150) = 7.49, p < 0.01). Posthoc analysis revealed that both during the first and second delay period, the activity elicited by the optimal-pair stimulus was significantly higher than those elicited by any other 23 stimuli (Tukey test, p < 0.05). These results indicate that the selectivity during the delay interval persisted even after the distractor presentation. Sorting the trial-to-trial neuronal discharge by the cue stimuli showed that the discharge of this neuron during the first and second delay periods was correlated with that elicited by the target stimulus, which can be seen in the optimal-pair trials (Figure 3D, upper side of pair number 3). In contrast to neurons with cue-holding activity, the activity during the second delay period did not seem to correlate with that during the first test period. Sorting the trial-to-trial discharge during the first test period and the following second delay period by the distractor stimuli showed that this neuron selectively responded to distractor stimuli during the first test period (ANOVA, F(23, 150) = 11.92, p < 0.01). However, selective discharge was not observed during the subsequent second delay period (Figure 3E) (ANOVA, F(23, 150) = 1.50, p = 0.08). This means that the delay activity of this neuron was correlated with that elicited by the target stimulus, irrespective of distractor presentation. The data presented thus far indicate that the delay activity of the neuron in Figure 2 is affected by the cue stimulus (“perception derived” and “behaviorally relevant”) and the distractor stimulus (“perception derived” and “behaviorally irrelevant”), whereas the delay activity of the neuron in Figure 3 is affected by the target stimulus (“LTM derived” and “behaviorally relevant”). In addition, it is also possible that neuronal responses during the second delay period could be affected by the paired associate of the distractor stimulus (distractor-target stimulus; “LTM derived” and “behaviorally irrelevant”). We regarded the cue and distractor stimuli to be perception derived in that both had been previously presented, whereas we regarded the target and distractor-target stimuli to be LTM derived in that both would be retrieved from LTM as a paired associate of the cue and distractor, respectively. Thus, because neuronal activity during the delay epoch could be affected by 2 × 2 types of stimuli (perception derived/LTM derived and behaviorally relevant/behaviorally irrelevant), we applied multiple regression analysis to evaluate the effects of each stimulus type on the delay activity (see Experimental Procedures). In this analysis, the neuronal discharges during the first and second delay periods were regressed by discharge elicited by the cue, target, distractor, and distractor-target stimuli, and the strength of the response modulation by a particular stimulus type was evaluated with the partial regression coefficients (Grunewald et al., 2002Grunewald A.

Shadlen M.N. A representation of the hazard rate of elapsed time in macaque area LIP.Nat. Neurosci. 2005; 8: 234-241Crossref PubMed Scopus (408) Google Scholar). For the first delay period, we designated the partial regression coefficients for the cue and target stimulus as β(cue,1) and β(target,1), respectively. For the second delay period, we designated the partial regression coefficients for the cue, target, distractor, and distractor-target stimulus as β(cue,2), β(target,2), β(distractor,2), and β(distractor-target,2), respectively. As an example, for the neuron in Figure 2, the β value for the cue stimulus during the first delay period was significant (β[cue,1] = 0.66, t = 10.81, p < 0.01), indicating significant cue stimulus information was signaled by this neuron during the first delay period, but the β value for the target stimulus was not significant (β[target,1] = 0.15, t = 2.48), indicating target stimulus information was not signaled. The β value for the cue stimulus during the second delay period was lower than that for the first delay period but was still significant (β[cue,2] = 0.23, t = 3.40), indicating this neuron signaled cue stimulus information to a lesser degree during the second delay period than during the first delay period. Notably, the highest β value during the second delay period was for activity elicited by the distractor stimulus (β[distractor,2] = 0.43, t = 6.36; β[target,2] = 0.22, t = 3.08; β[distractor-target,2] = −0.05, t = −0.71), indicating that what was signaled by this neuron during the second delay period was mainly distractor stimulus information. For the neuron in Figure 3, the target stimulus significantly affected the discharge during both the first and second delay periods (β[target,1] = 0.75, t = 14.76; β[target,2] = 0.63, t = 9.89), but the other stimuli did not (β[cue,1] = 0.11, t = 2.2; β[cue,2] = 0.04, t = 0.62; β[distractor,2] = 0.07, t = 1.13; β[distractor-target,2] = 0.07, t = 1.08). Apparently, this neuron continues to signal target stimulus information, even during the second delay period after an intervening distractor. We next carried out the multiple regression analysis on all the delay-selective neurons recorded (n = 59). The scatter plots in Figures 4A and 4B show, respectively, the β values for the cue and target stimuli during the first and second delay periods. We found that the β values for the cue stimulus lay below the orthogonal line (dotted line in Figures 4A and 4B), while those for the target stimulus lay around it. The mean β value for the cue stimulus during the second delay period decreased to less than half of that during the first delay period (β[cue,1] = 0.32; β[cue,2] = 0.14), though both were significantly positive (t = 8.7 and 6.7, respectively; p < 0.01). On the other hand, the mean β values for the target stimulus were comparable in the first and second delay periods (β[target,1] = 0.25; β[target,2] = 0.20), and again, both were significantly positive (t = 8.3 and 7.4, respectively; p < 0.01). To examine the relationship between the β values during the first and second delay periods, we fitted regression lines to the β values for the cue and target stimuli (Figures 4A and 4B, blue and red lines, respectively). The regression line to β values for the cue stimulus was y = 0.426x + 0.003 (r2 = 0.56, p < 0.01), and that to β values for the target stimulus was y = 0.720x + 0.020 (r2 = 0.64, p < 0.01). The slopes of both were significantly positive (β values for the cue stimulus, t = 8.58, p < 0.01; β values for the target stimulus, t = 9.95, p < 0.01), implying a direct relationship between the signal strength in the first delay period and that in the second delay period. We then tested whether the slopes of the regression lines significantly differed by analysis of covariance (ANCOVA) in which the β values during the second delay period were fitted with those during the first delay period as a covariate, stimulus features (cue or target) as a categorical variable, and the interaction between them (Littell et al., 2002Littell R.C. Stroup W.W. Freund R.J. SAS for Linear Models.Fourth Edition. SAS Institute, North Carolina2002Google Scholar). Interestingly, the slope of the regression line for the β values for the target stimulus was significantly steeper than that for the cue stimulus (interaction in ANCOVA, F = 11.57, p < 0.01). This means that the target stimulus information during the second delay period is significantly closer in strength to the signal during the first delay period than is the case with the cue stimulus. We next considered the numbers of neurons with significant β values (Figure 4, histograms). We found that the number of neurons with significantly (p < 0.01) positive β values for the cue stimulus declined from 38 in first delay period to 13 in the second delay period, whereas the number of neurons with significantly positive β values for the target stimulus were similar in both delay periods (29 and 27 neurons). The proportion of neurons with significant β value during second delay period to those during the first delay period was different in two stimuli (cue and target) at p < 0.05 (chi-square test, χ2 = 5.89, p = 0.015). In sum, these results indicate that target stimulus information signaled by delay activity among this population is more resistant to the distractor stimulus than cue stimulus information. We also tested whether the neuronal responses during the second delay period signaled information about behaviorally irrelevant stimuli—i.e., the perception-derived information about the distractor stimulus and the LTM-derived information about the distractor-target stimulus. Figure 5A shows population histograms of the β values for the distractor and distractor-target stimuli. Mean values of both were significantly positive (mean β[distractor,2] = 0.19, t = 7.93; mean β[distractor-target,2] = 0.04, t = 3.21; p < 0.01), though the mean β value for the distractor stimulus was much larger than that for the distractor-target stimulus (paired t test, t = 4.88, p < 0.01). As for the numbers of neurons with a significantly positive β value, there was also a notable difference between β values for the distractor and distractor-target stimulus (23 neurons for β[distractor,2] and two neurons for β[distractor-target,2] out of 59 neurons, respectively; chi-square test, χ2 = 22.38, p < 0.01). These results indicate that although both the distractor and distractor-target stimuli were irrelevant for solving the DPA task, distractor stimulus information was signaled in the subsequent second delay activity, whereas distractor-target stimulus information was hardly signaled. Distractor information was conveyed by the neuron with cue-holding activity shown in Figure 2 but not by the neuron with target-recall activity shown in Figure 3. Thus, whether or not distractor information is conveyed likely depends on which type of information a neuron signals during the first delay period, cue holding and/or target recall. To investigate this in more detail, we categorized delay-selective neurons by the significance of their β(cue,1) and β(target,1) values. For this analysis, we defined neurons with significant β(cue,1) but nonsignificant β(target,1) as cue-holding neurons, whereas neurons with significant β(target,1) but nonsignificant β(cue,1) were categorized as target-recall neurons; neurons with both significant β(cue,1) and β(target,1) were categorized as “mixed-type neurons.” When we calculated the mean β values for the distractor and distractor-target stimuli during the second delay period in each category (Figure 5B), we found that cue-holding neurons showed a significantly positive mean β value for the distractor stimulus (mean β[distractor,2] = 0.29; t = 7.85, p < 0.01, corrected by Bonferroni's method), whereas target-recall neurons did not (mean β[distractor,2] = 0.06; t = 2.12, p = 0.053, Bonferroni's method). Like cue-holding neurons, mixed-type neurons also showed significantly positive β values for the distractor stimulus (mean β[distractor,2] = 0.22; t = 4.44, p < 0.01, Bonferroni's method). None of these neuron types showed significantly positive β values for the distractor-target stimulus (mean β[distractor-target,2] was 0.02, 0.09, and 0.05, respectively). We then calculated the numbers of each neuron type that showed significant β values during the second delay period (β[cue,2], β[target,2], β[distractor,2], and β[distractor-target,2]) (Table 1). 15 of the 24 cue-holding neurons (63%) had significant β values for the distractor stimulus during the second delay period, whereas only seven (29%) had significant β values for the cue stimulus. This means that neurons signaling cue-stimulus information during the first delay period tended to signal distractor-stimulus information during the second delay period. By contrast, ten of 15 target-recall neurons (67%) had significant β values for the target stimulus during the second delay period, and the effects of the distractor and distractor-target stimuli were negligible (significant β values were obtained for zero and one neuron, respectively). This means that neurons signaling target-stimulus information during the first delay period tended to continue to do so during the second delay period. As for mixed-type neurons, the number of neurons with significant β values for the target stimulus was larger than that with significant β values for the cue stimulus (β[target,2], 10/14 or 71%; β[cue,2], 6/14 or 43%). In addition, half of the mixed-type neurons showed significant β values for the distractor stimulus (β[distractor,2], 7/14 or 50%).Table 1Number of Neurons with Significant Regression Coefficients during Second Delay PeriodCoefficient Type (Second Delay)Behaviorally RelevantBehaviorally IrrelevantPerception DerivedLTM DerivedPerception DerivedLTM Derive"

In humans, the SPCA1 haploinsufficiency caused by mutations in one allele of the SPCA1 gene (ATP2C1; cytogenetic position 3q22.1) determines the Hailey-Hailey skin disease phenotype (8Hu Z.

In addition to ATP2C1, the human genome contains a second SPCA gene (ATP2C2, cytogenetic position 16q24.1), whose protein product (SPCA2 of 946 amino acids) has not been studied until very recently (10Vanoevelen J.

Orthologue SPCA2 genes are found in higher vertebrates such as amphibians, birds, and mammals. It became clear that SPCA2 must play other physiological roles than SPCA1 because SPCA2 does not compensate for the reduction in the SPCA1 activity in Hailey-Hailey skin disease patients. Despite being located on different human chromosomes, the exon/intron layout is perfectly conserved between ATP2C1 and ATP2C2 (10Vanoevelen J. Dode L. Van Baelen K. Fairclough R.J. Missiaen L.

The two proteins encoded by the respective genes share a 64% amino acid sequence identity and display a different tissue expression pattern.

For SPCA1, further isoform diversity is brought about by alternative splicing of the ATP2C1 pre-mRNA at its 3′ end giving rise to three functionally active splice variants (SPCA1a of 919 amino acids, SPCA1b of 939 amino acids, and SPCA1d of 949 amino acids) and one inactive truncated isoform (SPCA1c of 888 amino acids) (3Dode L.

So far, no splice variants have been reported for ATP2C2. Relative to SERCA1a, the SPCA1 enzymes display remarkably high apparent affinities for cytosolic Ca2+ (K0.5 = 0.01–0.04 μm) in activation of the ATPase and phosphorylation activities and relatively low maximal turnover rates (3Dode L.

Further investigations showed that these differences are mainly due to a reduction in the rate of the energy-transducing E1∼P(Ca) to E2-P conformational transition (3Dode L. Andersen J.P.

Furthermore, it is not yet clear whether the amino acid differences observed between SPCA1 and SPCA2 protein sequences would translate into different functional properties. In the present study, the biochemical characteristics of the human SPCA2 enzyme have been analyzed and compared with those of human SPCA1d and rabbit SERCA1a enzymes upon their transient heterologous expression in HEK-293 cells. The kinetic differences between SPCA2 and SPCA1d isozymes reported here have direct consequences for the maximum turnover rate as well as for the substrate (Ca2+, ATP, or Pi) and inhibitor (vanadate or thapsigargin) concentration dependences. Our findings may reflect a specialized physiological role for SPCA2 in a restricted number of cell types. The full-length cDNA clones used encode the human SPCA2 (10Vanoevelen J. Dode L.

All of the methods measuring the phosphorylation levels take advantage of the fact that only the Ca2+-bound enzyme is able to phosphorylate with ATP (20Petithory J.R. Jencks W.P. Biochemistry. 1988; 27: 5553-5564Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). The background phosphorylation levels built up in reactions with [γ-32P]ATP or 32Pi were determined by adding, respectively, excess EGTA or Ca2+ prior to phosphorylation. The contribution of the endogenous SPCA1 and SERCA2b pumps in the transfected HEK-293 cells to these enzymatic measurements is negligible in comparison with the contribution of the highly expressed exogenous calcium pumps. The phosphorylation level of SERCA1a transiently expressed in HEK-293 was similar to that previously reported (14Dode L. Andersen J.P. Leslie N. Dhitavat J. Vilsen B. Hovnanian A. J. Biol.

In this study, the human SPCA2 pump was further analyzed in detail and compared with the newly characterized human SPCA1d paralogue (3Dode L. Andersen J.P. Raeymaekers L. Missiaen L. Vilsen B.

The expression level of SPCA2 in HEK-293 cells was examined quantitatively by determining the maximum capacity for phosphorylation with [γ-32P]ATP in the presence of activating Ca2+ (forward reaction 3 in Scheme 1) under conditions (neutral pH and 0 °C) known to minimize the turnover of the E1∼P(Ca) phosphoenzyme (data not shown). With or without thapsigargin present (0.1 μm) to inhibit the endogenous SERCA2b activity, the maximum phosphorylation levels obtained for SPCA2 and SPCA1d ranged between 150 and 250 pmol of active enzyme/mg microsomal protein, several hundred-fold higher than that of the endogenous SPCA1 and SERCA2b pumps in control HEK-293 cells and comparable with those previously shown for the exogenously expressed SERCAs (14Dode L.

Thapsigargin Sensitivity—Fig. 1 compares the sensitivity of SPCA2, SPCA1d, and SERCA1a to thapsigargin inhibition determined by thapsigargin titration of the phosphoenzyme formation in the presence of activating Ca2+ and [γ-32P]ATP as described (18Andersen J.P. Sørensen T.L.-M. Povlsen K. Vilsen B. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 23312-23321Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar); the Ca2+-free thapsigargin-reactive E2 form believed to bind the inhibitor was first allowed to interact with thapsigargin for 15 min under specific conditions (absence of Ca2+, i.e. presence of EGTA), and then excess Ca2+ and [γ-32P]ATP were added to initiate the phosphorylation reaction. As expected, SERCA1a displayed an extremely high affinity for thapsigargin (Kd = 0.031 nm). Previous observations indicated that micromolar concentrations of thapsigargin are ineffective in inhibiting SPCAs found in various organisms such as yeast (5 μm in Ref. 21Sorin A. Rosas G. Rao R. J.

Here we show for the first time that the affinity of SPCA1d for thapsigargin (Kd = 28 μm) is several orders of magnitude lower than that of SERCA1a. Interestingly, the SPCA2 isozyme displayed a 14-fold increased affinity for thapsigargin (Kd = 2 μm) relative to SPCA1d. The increased affinity of SPCA2 for thapsigargin has the practical consequence that the amount of total thapsigargin needed to selectively inhibit the endogenous SERCA2b should not exceed 0.1 μm. The use of higher concentrations (in the micromolar range) of thapsigargin will certainly lead to errors in estimating the level of SPCA2 activity, e.g. the maximum capacity for phosphorylation with [γ-32P]ATP (see above) and the maximum turnover rate of the ATPase activity (see below). ATPase Activity—Steady-state ATPase activity was determined by colorimetrically monitoring the release of inorganic phosphate. Fig. 2 shows the corresponding Ca2+ dependence of the ATPase turnover rate determined in the presence and absence of the calcium ionophore A23187 at pH 7.0 and 37 °C. In the absence of calcium ionophore, the E1∼P(Ca) to E2-P transition (step 4 in Scheme 1) becomes inhibited by the binding of accumulated Ca2+ at luminal low affinity sites, but the addition of calcium ionophore relieves this inhibition by collapsing the Ca2+ gradient across the microsomal membranes. Fig. 2 demonstrates that for medium Ca2+ concentrations in the micromolar range, the addition of the calcium ionophore increases the ATPase activity about 3-fold for both SPCA2 and SPCA1d, because the inhibitory effect of luminal Ca2+ is relieved. The maximum ATPase turnover rate determined under these conditions for SPCA2 (40.7 s–1) was significantly (1.5-fold) higher than that of SPCA1d (27 s–1) but 3.2-fold lower than that of SERCA1a (129 s–1). The apparent affinities for Ca2+ activation of the ATPase activity displayed by SPCA2 and SPCA1d were quite indistinguishable from each other (K0.5 values of 0.041 and 0.037 μm, respectively) but definitely much higher than that of SERCA1a (K0.5 = 0.31 μm). Similar Hill coefficient (nH) values close to 1 indicate that both SPCA2 and SPCA1d make use of single high affinity Ca2+ binding sites to transport one Ca2+ per each ATP hydrolyzed. Ca2+ Dependence of Phosphorylation by [γ-32P]ATP—Because the phosphorylation reaction, unlike the ATPase activity, is not inhibited at high Ca2+ concentration, a more accurate determination of the apparent affinity for Ca2+ activation and Hill coefficient is possible by monitoring the Ca2+ dependence of phosphorylation with [γ-32P]ATP (Fig. 3). The apparent Ca2+ affinity obtained for SPCA2 by this method at pH 7.0 and 25 °C was again very high (K0.5 = 0.025 μm) but 2.5-fold lower (i.e. K0.5 higher) than that of SPCA1d (K0.5 = 0.010 μm). The phosphorylation measurement, like the ATPase activity provided Hill coefficient values for both SPCA2 and SPCA1d consistent with the existence of a single cytoplasmically facing high affinity Ca2+ binding site/ATPase molecule. Rapid Kinetic Analysis of Ca2+ Binding—The rate constant of the Ca2+ binding transition (forward reactions 1 and 2 in Scheme 1, i.e. E2 to E1Ca) was determined at 25 °C by rapid kinetic measurements of the phosphorylation with [γ-32P]ATP according to the double mixing protocol shown as a diagram at the top of Fig. 4. Accordingly, the Ca2+-deprived enzyme was incubated with saturating Ca2+ (100 μm final free Ca2+ concentration) for a variable period of time (t in Fig. 4) followed by a 50-ms incubation with 5 μm [γ-32P]ATP before acid quenching. The rate constants corresponding to the Ca2+ binding transition were determined by fitting a monoexponential function with an initial offset. The rate constant of human SPCA2 (2.93 s–1) was found markedly reduced relative to SPCA1d (22.42 s–1) and SERCA1a (11.44 s–1), i.e. a 7-fold decrease relative to SPCA1d. There was no significant difference between SPCA2, SPCA1d, and SERCA1a with respect to the initial offset value, which depends on the initial amount of E1 together with the amount of E1 formed from E2 during the 50-ms incubation in the presence of [γ-32P]ATP. Rapid Kinetic Analysis of Ca2+ Dissociation—The rate constant of Ca2+ dissociation (k–Ca) from the Ca2+-bound E1 form (reverse reaction 2 in Scheme 1) at 25 °C and pH 7.0 (Fig. 5) was determined as previously described (17Sørensen T.L.-M. Dupont Y. Vilsen B. Andersen J.P. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 5400-5408Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar) by comparing the level of phosphoenzyme formed 34 ms after the simultaneous addition of excess EGTA and [γ-32P]ATP to the enzyme pre-equilibrated with saturating Ca2+ (EPATP+EGTA) with the phosphoenzyme level measured after 34 ms of incubation with Ca2+ and [γ-32P]ATP (EPATP). The rate of Ca2+ dissociation (indicative of the interaction between Ca2+ and SPCA in the E1 form) for SPCA2 (26.7 s–1) was 1.4-fold reduced relative to SPCA1d (36.7 s–1) but almost identical to that of SERCA1a (27.0 s–1). Hence, the 2.5-fold lower apparent affinity of SPCA2 for cytosolic Ca2+, relative to SPCA1d, manifested during the phosphorylation activity (Fig. 3) is not mirrored by a similar decrease of the true affinity of the E1 form for Ca2+; on the contrary, the rate constant obtained for SPCA2 would rather suggest an increase in the true affinity for Ca2+. Relative to SERCA1a, the rate constant of Ca2+ dissociation in SPCA2 reflects similar true affinities for Ca2+, despite the much higher apparent Ca2+ affinity of SPCA2 determined by studying the Ca2+ dependence of ATPase (Fig. 2) and phosphorylation (Fig. 3) activities. The reason for this will be further dealt with under “Discussion.” Rapid Kinetic Analysis of Phosphorylation—Fig. 6 illustrates the time course of phosphorylation (reaction 3 in Scheme 1) determined in the presence of 5 μm ATP with the enzyme initially present in the Ca2+-saturated form. Although the phosphorylation data for the SPCA2 and SPCA1d isozymes can be easily fitted by monoexponential functions with the rate cons"

Constitutively active PKB mutants induce GLUT4 translocation in the absence of insulin, whereas dominant negative PKB mutants and ablation of PKB using small interfering RNA decrease insulin-stimulated glucose uptake (8Watson R.T.

We demonstrated that insulin stimulates p122RhoGAP phosphorylation on Ser-322 in both primary adipocytes and in an insulin-responsive cultured cell line (Chinese hamster ovary (CHO.T cells) and that PKB can directly phosphorylate p122RhoGAP on Ser-322 in vitro. We also showed that p122RhoGAP can be phosphorylated in vitro by RSK1, another member of the AGC family of protein kinases, and that this also occurs in intact cells in an insulin-stimulated manner via the MEK/ERK signaling pathway. Thus, Ser-322 phosphorylation of p122RhoGAP acts as an integrator of two distinct signal transduction pathways with the relative contribution of the PKB and MEK pathways in insulin-stimulated p122RhoGAP phosphorylation clearly depending on the cellular background involved. Materials—Male Wistar rats (160–210 g) were fed ad libitum on a stock diet (CRM; Bioshore, Manea, Cambridgeshire, UK). Wortmannin and rapamycin were from Calbiochem (Bad Soden, Germany), and UO126 was from Promega Biosciences (San Luis Obispo, CA). The anti-p122RhoGAP polyclonal antibody was as described previously (22Kawai K. Yamaga M. Iwamae Y. Kiyota M. Kamata H. Hirata H. Homma Y. Yagisawa H. Biochem. Soc.

The anti-PKB substrate antibody (PAS), anti-phospho-PKB (Thr-308), anti-phospho-ERK (Thr-202/Tyr-204), and anti-phosphop70S6K (Thr-389) were all from Cell Signaling Technology (Beverly, MA). The anti-PKBα antibody was obtained from Santa Cruz Biotechnology (Santa Cruz, CA), whereas the anti-green fluorescent protein (GFP) monoclonal antibody came from Roche Diagnostics, Ltd. (Lewes, East Sussex, UK). Unless otherwise stated, all other reagents were as described previously (23Hers I. Bell C.J. Poole A.W. Jiang D. Denton R.M. Schaefer E. Tavare J.M. Biochem. J. 2002; 368: 875-884Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Plasmids—The constitutively active myristoylated PKB (myrPKB) and constitutively active p110 subunit of PI 3-kinase (p110CAAX) were kindly provided by Prof. B. Hemmings (Friedlich Miescher Institute, Basal, Switzerland) and Prof. J. Downward (Cancer Research UK, London Research Institute, London, UK), respectively, and were subcloned into the vector pcDNA3 (Invitrogen). The constitutively active MEK-MANE construct was kindly provided by Dr. Stephen Hooper (Institute of Cancer Research, London, UK). The GFP-p122RhoGAP construct was as described previously (24Yamaga M. Sekimata M. Fujii M. Kawai K. Kamata H. Hirata H. Homma Y. Yagisawa H. Genes Cells. 2004; 9: 25-37Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). Mutagenesis using the wild-type GFP-p122RhoGAP as a template was undertaken with the QuikChange system (Stratagene, Amsterdam, Holland) following the manufacturer’s protocol. Three mutants were created (i) p122RhoGAP(S320A), (ii) p122RhoGAP(S322A), and (iii) p122RhoGAP(S559A). Preparation of Rat Epididymal Adipocytes—Adipocytes were isolated from the epididymal fat pads of Wistar rats as described previously (23Hers I. Bell C.J. Poole A.W. Jiang D. Denton R.M. Schaefer E. Tavare J.M. Biochem. J. 2002; 368: 875-884Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Cells were subsequently washed in Krebs-bicarbonate-HEPES buffer (130 mm NaCl, 4.7 mm KCl, 1.5 mm MgSO4, 1.2 mm CaCl2, 2.5 mm NaH2PO4, 15.5 mm NaHCO3, 10 mm HEPES, and 11 mm glucose, pH 7.4) with 1% bovine serum albumin added prior to the experiment. Transfection of Primary Adipocytes—Primary adipocytes were transfected as described previously (15Berwick D.C. Hers I. Heesom K.J. Moule S.K. Tavare J.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 33895-33900Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (257) Google Scholar) with a few adjustments. In short, freshly isolated cells were washed in intracellular Krebs-bicarbonate-HEPES buffer, pH 7.4 (4 mm NaCl, 125 mm KCl, 1 mm EGTA, 1 mm MgCl2, 2.5 mm NaH2PO4, 15.5 mm NaHCO3,10mm HEPES, and 11 mm glucose) with 1% bovine serum albumin. A 0.4-cm electrode gap Gene Pulser cuvette (Bio-Rad) was used to electroporate 500 μl of cells (30% cytocrit) in the presence of 15 μg of plasmid DNA. Electroporation was performed by administering five pulses at 500 V and a capacitance of 50 microfarads using a Gene Pulser transfection apparatus (Bio-Rad). After electroporation, the cells were transferred to a 30-ml tube (Bibby-Sterilin, Ltd., Staffs, UK) and incubated for 30 min at 37 °C before replacing the medium with 4 ml of Dulbecco’s modified Eagle’s medium (containing 1% bovine serum albumin, 2 mm glutamine, 200 nm phenylisopropyladenosine, 100 μg of gentamycin, and 25 mm HEPES, pH 7.4). The cells were incubated for an additional 17 h at 37 °C and 5% CO2 and subsequently washed into Krebsbicarbonate-HEPES buffer without bovine serum albumin prior to the experiment. Incubation of Transfected Rat Epididymal Adipocytes—Cells were washed into Krebs-bicarbonate-HEPES buffer, pH 7.4, without bovine serum albumin and left untreated or incubated with 100 nm wortmannin, 10 μm UO126, or 200 nm rapamycin for 30 min at 37 °C prior to stimulation with 87 nm insulin for the times indicated. The reaction was terminated by extracting the cells 1:1 (packed cell volume/volume) in ice cold Nonidet P-40 extraction buffer (50 mm Tris, pH 7.5, containing 1% Nonidet P-40, 1 mm EDTA, 120 mm NaCl, 50 mm NaF, 40 mm β-glycerophosphate, 1 mm benzamidine, 1 μm microcystin, 10 mm sodium orthovanadate, and 1 μg/ml each of pepstatin, leupeptin, and antipain). Cell extracts were centrifuged at 10,000 × g for 10 min at 4 °C, and the infranatant was taken for subsequent analysis. Culture, Transfection, and Incubation of CHO.T Cells—CHO.T cells (CHO cells stably expressing the human insulin receptor) were cultured in Ham’s F-12 medium containing 5% (v/v) fetal calf serum, 200 units/ml benzylpenicillin, 100 μg/ml streptomycin, and 0.25 mg/ml G-418. CHO.T cells at 70% confluence were transfected in 60-mm dishes with 5 μg of each plasmid (GFP-tagged wild-type RhoGAP, p110CAAX, myrPKB, or MEK-MANE) using a charge ratio of 3 μl of FuGENE 6 reagent (Roche Applied Science) per μg of plasmid DNA, according to the manufacturer’s instructions. After 5 h, the cells were serum-starved for 16 h, treated with insulin (87 nm) for the time period indicated in the figure legends, and washed twice in ice-cold phosphatebuffered saline before extraction by scraping into 500 μl of ice-cold Nonidet P-40 extraction buffer (50 mm Tris, pH 7.5, containing 1% Nonidet P-40, 1 mm EDTA, 120 mm NaCl, 50 mm NaF, 40 mm β-glycerophosphate, 1 mm benzamidine, 1 μm microcystin, 10 mm sodium orthovanadate, and 1 μg/ml each of pepstatin, leupeptin, and antipain). Cell lysates were centrifuged at 10,000 × g for 10 min at 4 °C, and the supernatant was taken for subsequent analysis. Immunoprecipitation—The GFP-labeled p122RhoGAP was immunoprecipitated by rotating 250 μl of total cell extract with 5 μl of anti-GFP antibody and 10 μl of protein G-Sepharose (50% w/v) at 4 °C. The protein G-Sepharose beads were isolated by centrifugation and washed three times in Nonidet P-40 extraction buffer. Subsequently, Laemmli sample buffer was added, and proteins were separated by SDS-PAGE for immunoblotting. Immunoblotting—Proteins were separated by SDS-PAGE using 3–8% gradient gels (p122RhoGAP immunoprecipitates) or 7.5% gels (total lysates) and transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride membranes (Immobilon). The membranes were blocked in 10% (w/v) bovine serum albumin dissolved in Tris-buffered saline with 0.1% Tween (TBS-T; 20 mm Tris, pH 7.6, 137 mm NaCl, 0.1% Tween) and subsequently incubated with primary and secondary antibodies, which were diluted in TBS-T containing 5% (w/v) bovine serum albumin. The blots were washed at least five times for 5 min after each antibody incubation and developed using an Enhanced ChemiLuminescence detection system (AP Biotech, Amersham Biosciences). Primary antibodies were used at a concentration of 1 μg/ml. Horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibody (Amersham Biosciences) was diluted 1:10,000 for all antibodies. Production of Recombinant GST-p122RhoGAP-—p122RhoGAP was expressed as a recombinant fusion with GST in Escherichia coli. Briefly, 2 liters of cells were grown to an optical density (A600) of 0.8, and protein expression was induced over 2 h by the addition of 0.5 mm isopropyl β-d-thiogalactopyranoside. The cells were harvested by centrifugation and resuspended in 40 ml of ice-cold lysis buffer (50 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 1% Triton X-100, 150 mm NaCl, 5 mm MgCl, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 0.2 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride), and the cells were then broken by sonication. Insoluble material was removed by centrifugation, and GST-p122RhoGAP protein was purified through binding to glutathioneSepharose beads. Purified GST-p122RhoGAP protein was stored on beads in aliquots at –80 °C. Identification of p122RhoGAP as an Insulin-stimulated Phosphoprotein—To identify novel substrates for PKB, we stimulated primary adipocytes with insulin in the absence and presence of the PI 3-kinase inhibitor wortmannin. The cell extracts were fractionated by Mono Q anion exchange chromatography, and fractions were immunoblotted with the PAS antibody. As shown in Fig. 1A, insulin stimulated an increase in phosphorylation of several proteins that eluted from the Mono Q column between 300 and 370 mm sodium chloride (fractions 20–22). Phosphorylation of the majority of these proteins was reduced in the presence of wortmannin. Coomassie staining of fraction 22 revealed the presence of numerous proteins (Fig. 1B), and therefore we subjected this fraction to further purification by size exclusion chromatography (Superose 12). A phosphoprotein reactive with the PAS antiserum and with an apparent molecular weight of ∼120 kDa was abundant and well separated from other proteins upon Coomassie staining. 3I. Hers and J. M. Tavaré, unpublished observations. This protein was excised from the gel, eluted, and digested with trypsin. Analysis of the tryptic peptide masses using the ProFound data base led to the identification of this protein as p122RhoGAP (25Homma Y. Emori Y. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 286-291Crossref PubMed Scopus (188) Google Scholar). Insulin Stimulates the Phosphorylation of p122RhoGAP at Ser-322 in Primary Adipocytes and CHO.T Cells—Analysis of the amino acid sequence of p122RhoGAP using the prediction program Scansite (scansite.mit.edu) suggested the presence of high stringency putative PKB phosphorylation sites at Ser-320 (VTRTRS320LST) and Ser-559 (RLRWHS559FQS). Manual inspection of the amino acid sequence surrounding Ser-320 revealed an additional potential phosphorylation site at Ser-322 (VTRTRSLS322 T) conforming to part of the consensus sequence RXRXX(S/T) for PKB phosphorylation. To investigate whether one or more of these sites are phosphorylated upon insulin stimulation, we transfected primary adipocytes and CHO.T cells with p122RhoGAP constructs containing substitutions of Ser-320, Ser-322, and Ser-559→ Ala. Fig. 2 demonstrates that insulin stimulation leads to the phosphorylation of p122RhoGAP in both primary adipocytes (Fig. 2A) and CHO.T cells (Fig. 2B), as determined by immunoblotting with the PAS antiserum. Although mutation of Ser-320 and Ser-559 to Ala had no significant effect on the phosphorylation of p122RhoGAP, mutation of Ser-322 abrogated the reactivity of p122RhoGAP with the PAS antibody in both cell types (Fig. 2). These results demonstrate that Ser-322 is the major insulin-stimulated phosphorylation site recognized by the PAS antibody on p122RhoGAP in both primary adipocytes and CHO.T cells. PKB Phosphorylates p122RhoGAP in Vitro on Ser-322—To determine whether p122RhoGAP is a direct substrate for PKB in vitro, we incubated recombinant GST-p122RhoGAP in the presence and absence of recombinant active PKB and ATP. Phosphorylation of wildtype p122RhoGAP was substantially increased in the presence of PKB (as shown in Fig. 3, left panel, lane 2). PKB also phosphorylated several lower molecular mass breakdown products of p122RhoGAP in the range of 50–122 kDa. The ability of PKB to phosphorylate p122RhoGAP on the site recognized by the PAS antibody was completely lost in the Ser-322→ Ala mutant, further demonstrating that Ser-322 is the phosphorylation site recognized by this antibody (Fig. 3). p122RhoGAP Is Phosphorylated in a PI 3-Kinase-dependent Manner in Primary Adipocytes—We next investigated whether insulin-stimulated p122RhoGAP Ser-322 phosphorylation was regulated downstream of PI 3-kinase and PKB in intact cells. To do this, we transfected primary adipocytes with wild-type p122RhoGAP and subsequently incubated them with or without the PI 3-kinase inhibitor wortmannin. We also examined the effect of UO126, which inhibits the activation of ERK, and rapamycin, which inhibits the activation of mTOR and S6K, the latter a ribosomal protein S6 kinase. Fig. 4A shows that insulin-stimulated p122RhoGAP phosphorylation was completely inhibited in the presence of wortmannin, whereas UO126 and rapamycin had only very weak inhibitory effects. In Fig. 4, B–D, we confirmed the efficacy and selectivity of the inhibitors for insulin-stimulated phosphorylation of PKB (Fig. 4B), ERK (Fig. 4C), and S6K (Fig. 4D). These results demonstrate that the major insulin-stimulated pathway leading to p122RhoGAP Ser-322 phosphorylation in primary adipocytes is PI 3-kinase-dependent. Expression of Constitutively Active PI 3-Kinase and PKB Mutants Stimulate p122RhoGAP Phosphorylation in Primary Adipocytes Independently of Insulin—To investigate whether activation of PI 3-kinase and/or PKB is sufficient for phosphorylation of Ser-322 on p122RhoGAP, we co-transfected primary adipocytes with membranetargeted constitutively active mutants of either PI 3-kinase (p110CAAX) or PKB (myrPKB) in conjunction with the p122RhoGAP expression vector. Fig. 5 demonstrates that both p110.CAAX and myr-PKB induced an insulin-independent increase in the phosphorylation of p122RhoGAP on Ser-322. These results demonstrate that activation of PI 3-kinase or PKB is sufficient to stimulate Ser-322 phosphorylation of p122RhoGAP in primary adipocytes. Insulin-stimulated Phosphorylation of p122-RhoGAP in CHO.T Cells Is Dependent on the MEK Signaling Pathway—In contrast to the results in primary adipocytes, we found that insulin-stimulated p122RhoGAP Ser-322 phosphorylation in CHO.T cells was only marginally inhibited by pretreatment with wortmannin (Fig. 6A) under conditions where insulin-stimulated PKB phosphorylation was completely blocked (Fig. 6B). In these cells, the MEK inhibitor UO126 reduced p122RhoGAP Ser-322 phosphorylation to 28 ± 8% (n = 5, average ± S.E.) of control, suggesting that a kinase downstream of ERK is primarily responsible for the phosphorylation of this site in this cellular background. The residual insulin-stimulated p122RhoGAP phosphorylation observed in the presence of a maximally effective UO126 concentration was blocked by the further addition of wortmannin. This suggests that the MEK/ERK pathway plays a dominant role over the PI 3-kinase/PKB pathway, with the contribution of the latter pathway only becoming apparent upon complete inhibition of MEK (Fig. 6A). The mTOR inhibitor rapamycin had no significant effect on p122RhoGAP Ser-322 phosphorylation under any condition (Fig. 6A). Fig. 6, B–D, again confirms the efficacy of these inhibitors under the conditions used. These results demonstrate that insulin-stimulated p122RhoGAP Ser-322 phosphorylation in CHO.T cells is dependent on both PI 3-kinase and MEK but is independent of mTOR. p122RhoGAP Ser-322 Phosphorylation Can Be Stimulated by Either Constitutively Active PKB or Constitutively Active MEK in CHO.T Cells—As the MEK pathway appears to play a dominant and necessary role in insulin-stimulated Ser-322 phosphorylation, we next asked whether MEK activation was sufficient to induce Ser-322 phosphorylation in CHO.T cells using a constitutively active MEK mutant (MEK-MANE). Fig. 7 demonstrates that this was indeed the case. Co-expression of MEK-MANE with p122RhoGAP resulted in an increase in the phosphorylation of p122RhoGAP to an extent that was almost indistinguishable from that induced by either insulin or, interestingly, the constitutively active myrPKB. Thus, although the PI 3-kinase/PKB pathway plays a minor role in insulin-stimulated Ser-322 phosphorylation, this pathway is competent at inducing the phosphorylation of this site. Taken together, the results demonstrate that activation of either PKB or MEK is sufficient to stimulate Ser-322 phosphorylation of p122RhoGAP but that the MEK pathway predominates in insulin-stimulated Ser-322 phosphorylation in intact CHO.T cells. RSK1 Phosphorylates p122RhoGAP on Ser-322—Upon activation in cells, MEK phosphorylates and activates the downstream extracellular signal-regulated kinases 1 and 2 (ERK1/2). However, it is unlikely that Ser-322 is directly phosphorylated by ERK1/2 kinases, as this site does not lie within the consensus sequence phosphorylation by these kinases (Pro-Xaa-(Ser/Thr)-Pro). A good candidate for phosphorylation of Ser-322 on p122RhoGAP downstream of ERK1/2 is ribosomal S6 kinase-1 (RSK1), which, similar to PKB, is a member of the AGC kinase family. RSK1 is activated downstream of ERK1/2 and recognizes the same consensus motif as PKB (12Alessi D.R. Caudwell F.B. Andjelkovic M. Hemmings B.A. Cohen P. FEBS Lett. 1996; 399: 333-338Crossref PubMed Scopus (542) Google Scholar, 26Leighton I.A. Dalby K.N. Caudwell F.B. Cohen P.T. Cohen P. FEBS Lett. 1995; 375: 289-293Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar). To determine whether RSK1 phosphorylates p122RhoGAP on Ser-322, we incubated recombinant wild-type p122RhoGAP and p122RhoGAP containing a Ser-322→ Ala mutation with active RSK1 and ATP and analyzed p122RhoGAP phosphorylation using the PAS antibody. Incubation of wild-type p122RhoGAP with active RSK1 led to phosphorylation of p122RhoGAP (Fig. 8). This phosphorylation was reduced, although not blocked, in the Ser-322→ Ala mutant. These results demonstrate that RSK1 is able to phosphorylate p122RhoGAP on Ser-322 in vitro. In this study, we have demonstrated that the small GTPase-activating protein p122RhoGAP is a novel insulin-stimulated PKB substrate in two different cell types, primary adipocytes and CHO.T cells. We show that PKB directly phosphorylates p122RhoGAP on Ser-322 in vitro and that expression of active mutants of PI 3-kinase or PKB in primary adipocytes leads to Ser-322 phosphor"
https://openalex.org/W2085559048,"We document here the intrinsic fluorescence and 45Ca2+ binding properties of putative “E2P-related” complexes of Ca2+-free ATPase with fluoride, formed in the presence of magnesium, aluminum, or beryllium. Intrinsic fluorescence measurements suggest that in the absence of inhibitors, the ATPase complex with beryllium fluoride (but not those with magnesium or aluminum fluoride) does constitute an appropriate analog of the “ADP-insensitive” phosphorylated form of Ca2+-ATPase, the so-called “E2P” state. 45Ca2+ binding measurements, performed in the presence of 100 mm KCl, 5 mm Mg2+, and 20% Me2SO at pH 8, demonstrate that this ATPase complex with beryllium fluoride (but again not those with magnesium or aluminum fluoride) has its Ca2+ binding sites accessible for rapid, low affinity (submillimolar) binding of Ca2+ from the luminal side of SR. In addition, we specifically demonstrate that in this E2P-like form of ATPase, the presence of thapsigargin, 2,5-di-tert-butyl-1,4-dihydroxybenzene, or cyclopiazonic acid prevents 45Ca2+ binding (i.e. presumably prevents opening of the 45Ca2+ binding sites on the SR luminal side). Since crystals of E2P-related forms of ATPase have up to now been described in the presence of thapsigargin only, these results suggest that crystallizing an inhibitor-free E2P-like form of ATPase (like its complex with beryllium fluoride) would be highly desirable, to unambiguously confirm previous predictions about the exit pathway from the ATPase transmembrane Ca2+ binding sites to the SR luminal medium.

Sarcoplasmic reticulum (SR) 2The abbreviations used are: SR, sarcoplasmic reticulum; E2 and E1, nonphosphorylated forms of Ca2+-ATPase; E2P and E1P, phosphorylated forms of Ca2+-ATPase, respectively ADP-insensitive or ADP-sensitive; TG, thapsigargin; BHQ, 2,5-di-tert-butyl-1,4-dihydroxybenzene; CPA, cyclopiazonic acid; Mops, 4-morpholinepropanesulfonic acid; Tes, N-tris(hydroxymethyl)methyl-2-aminoethanesulfonic acid. Ca2+-ATPase (SERCA1a) is an ion pump, belonging to the family of P-type ATPases and responsible in muscle cells for active transport of Ca2+ from the cytosol into the sarcoplasmic reticulum lumen. It takes up Ca2+ ions from an aqueous compartment (the cytosol) where the concentration of these ions is low and releases them on the other side of the membrane into a compartment where the concentration of Ca2+ is already high. This requires that at some step during the catalytic cycle of ATP hydrolysis (which provides the required energy), the pump's affinity for Ca2+ changes from high affinity to low affinity, coupled with topological reorientation of the binding sites from one side of the membrane to the other. SR Ca2+-ATPase is generally described as having high affinity for cytosolic Ca2+ in its so-called “E” or “E1” conformation and low affinity for luminal Ca2+ in its phosphorylated so-called “*EP” or “E2P” conformation (e.g. see Refs. 1Makinose M.

Sørensen T.L. le Maire M. Curr. Opin. Struct. Biol. 2005; 15: 387-393Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar for a review). Although high affinity binding of Ca2+ to the E1 state of Ca2+-ATPase has been extensively documented, low affinity binding of Ca2+ to the ATPase E2P state has in most cases been deduced from indirect experiments only, because of the difficulties inherent in directly measuring low affinity 45Ca2+ binding to a species that, in addition, is not necessarily stable; only one attempt for such a direct measurement was described recently (7Vieyra A. Mintz E. Lowe J. Guillain F. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2005; 1667: 103-113Crossref Scopus (3) Google Scholar). Nevertheless, for complete description of the complete transport process, availability of a robust assay for characterizing the sites of Ca2+ release from phosphorylated ATPase toward the SR lumen would be highly desirable. Meanwhile, thanks to the recent crystallization of several forms of SR Ca2+-ATPase, elucidation of the structural basis for ATP-driven ion pumping has made significant steps forward. Detergent-solubilized SR Ca2+-ATPase has been crystallized under various forms, with the hope of understanding the structural changes occurring sequentially during its catalytic cycle (8Toyoshima C.

However, in none of these forms, including the Ca2+-free fluoride forms once thought to be related to E2P, was the exit pathway from the transport sites toward the luminal medium found fully open (13Toyoshima C.

Nature. 2004; 442: 361-368Crossref Scopus (382) Google Scholar). Moreover, it should be recalled that detergent-solubilized Ca2+-ATPase is highly unstable in the absence of Ca2+. Thus, to avoid Ca2+-ATPase irreversible denaturation on the time-scale of three-dimensional crystallization experiments, the crystals grown in the absence of Ca2+, including those for Ca2+-free fluoride forms (9Toyoshima C.

FEBS Lett. 1992; 304: 109-113Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). In this conformation, it binds in a cleft located between transmembrane segments 3, 5, and 7 (9Toyoshima C. Nomura H. Nature. 2002; 418: 605-611Crossref PubMed Scopus (808) Google Scholar, 19Zhong L. Inesi G. J. Biol.

Chem. 2004; 279: 17973-17979Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar), and it probably glues these segments together, resulting in ATPase protection against denaturation (21Seekoe T. Peall S. McIntosh D. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 46737-46744Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). Very recently, it was found that the presence, in addition to TG, of 2,5-di-tert-butyl-1,4-dihydroxybenzene (BHQ; an inhibitor of Ca2+-ATPase also thought to be specific for E2) improved the quality of “E2” crystals (22Obara K Miyashita N. Xu C. Toyoshima I. Sugita Y. Inesi G. Toyoshima C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2005; 102: 14489-14496Crossref PubMed Scopus (209) Google Scholar). It is fair to ask whether the presence of TG or other inhibitors could have biased the conclusions derived from crystals that failed to reveal transport sites open toward the lumen. Previous experimental results do not clearly suggest one answer or another. On the one hand, proteolysis experiments previously suggested that the presence of TG affects only little the overall ATPase conformation in its cytosolic region; for instance, the almost complete protection against proteolytic cleavage afforded by binding of vanadate or metal-fluoride complexes to the ATPase was observed to occur both in the presence and absence of TG (23Danko S. Daiho T. Yamasaki K. Kamidochi M. Suzuki H. Toyoshima C. FEBS Lett. 2001; 489: 277-282Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). Vanadate and fluoride are both thought to allow formation of complexes that are more or less closely related analogs of the ADP-insensitive phosphorylated state of the enzyme or of the transition state for dephosphorylation; they are here dubbed “E2P-related” states, in a loose sense. TG also did not greatly affect the superfluorescent state of TNP-AMP bound to the ATPase complex with beryllium fluoride (24Danko S. Yamasaki K. Daiho T. Suzuki H. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 14991-14998Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). On the other hand, it was previously shown that TG altered the affinity of Ca2+-free ATPase for ATP (16Kijima Y. Ogunbunmi E. Fleischer S. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 22912-22918Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), and it was suggested that the interaction of ATPase with thapsigargin (or BHQ) might result in formation of modified E2 species (25Wictome M. Henderson I. Lee A.G. East J.M. Biochem. J. 1992; 283: 525-529Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar, 26Wictome M. Khan Y.M. Lee A.G. East J.M. Biochem. J. 1995; 310: 859-868Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar, 27Khan Y.M. Wictome M. East J.M. Lee A.G. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 14385-14393Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). More specifically, TG was also shown to induce pretty large structural changes in two-dimensional crystals of the E2P-related E2·VO4 species (28Young H.S. Xu C. Zhang P. Stokes D.L. J. Mol. Biol. 2001; 308: 231-240Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar), and TG was suspected from Trp fluorescence experiments (but with no direct evidence) to close, in E2P-related states, the postulated Ca2+ release pathway from the ATPase sites toward the SR lumen (24Danko S. Yamasaki K. Daiho T. Suzuki H. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 14991-14998Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). Relevant to these issues, it should also be mentioned that the so-called “E2P-related” complexes of Ca2+-free ATPase with fluoride described so far did not all appear to be equally close to the “true” E2P form; all fluoride forms tested were inactive, but reactivation by exposure to a high luminal Ca2+ concentration was faster for the ATPase complex with beryllium fluoride than for those with aluminum fluoride or magnesium fluoride. Thus, the ATPase complex with beryllium fluoride was suggested to have its transport sites most widely open to luminal Ca2+ (24Danko S. Yamasaki K. Daiho T. Suzuki H. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 14991-14998Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). But again, in the absence of direct 45Ca2+ binding measurements, it is not possible to exclude the possibility that faster reactivation was due to reduced stability of the ATPase-fluoride complex in the presence of beryllium, compared with the two other metal ions. Here, to address these questions, critical ones indeed for the sensible interpretation of presently available or future x-ray structures of Ca2+-free ATPase forms, we establish a robust assay of 45Ca2+ binding to the luminal sites of Ca2+-ATPase forms where these sites appear, which gives results somewhat different from those previously reported by Vieyra et al. (7Vieyra A. Mintz E. Lowe J. Guillain F. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2005; 1667: 103-113Crossref Scopus (3) Google Scholar). Simultaneously, we study the effect of TG and other inhibitors on this binding. The properties of Ca2+-free ATPase-fluoride complexes formed in the presence of magnesium, aluminum, or beryllium and in the absence or presence of TG or other inhibitors (namely BHQ or cyclopiazonic acid (CPA)) are documented here. Intrinsic fluorescence measurements and 45Ca2+ binding measurements both demonstrate that in the absence of inhibitors, the ATPase complex with beryllium fluoride (but not that with magnesium or aluminum fluoride) constitutes an appropriate analog of the E2P state of Ca2+-ATPase, with its Ca2+ binding sites readily accessible from the SR lumen. In addition, we specifically demonstrate that in this E2P-like form of ATPase, the presence of TG, BHQ, or CPA prevents binding of 45Ca2+ (i.e. presumably prevents opening of the luminally oriented 45Ca2+ binding sites). As an unfortunate result of our study, there is therefore little hope that crystals grown in the presence of any of these inhibitors could reveal in an open form the pathway of Ca2+ ions from their binding sites (within the bundle of ATPase transmembrane segments) toward the SR lumen (where these ions are released as a result of their transport). On the more positive side, our results establish a new tool for monitoring low affinity binding of Ca2+ to the luminally oriented low affinity sites of E2P-like forms of Ca2+-ATPase. They simultaneously suggest that crystallizing an inhibitor-free E2·BeFx complex would indeed be of utmost interest, to confirm previous predictions about the Ca2+ internalization pathway from transmembrane binding sites in Ca2+-ATPase toward the SR luminal medium (13Toyoshima C. Nomura H. Tsuda T. Nature. 2004; 442: 361-368Crossref Scopus (382) Google Scholar). Membrane Preparation and Stock Solutions for Chemicals—SR membrane vesicles were prepared from rabbits as previously described (29Champeil P. Guillain F. Vénien C. Gingold M.P. Biochemistry. 1985; 24: 69-81Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar), after 2-day fasting of the animals and inclusion of 1 μg/ml α-amylase in the initial homogenization buffer (to avoid SR contamination with muscle phosphorylase; see, for example, Ref. 30Cuenda A. Henao F. Nogues M. Gutiérrez-Merino C. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1994; 1194: 35-43Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). Potassium fluoride (stock solution was 1 m in water) was from ICN (catalog no. 156339), TG (stock solution was 1 mg/ml in Me2SO; i.e. about 1.5 mm) was from Calbiochem (catalog no. 586005), CPA (stock solution was 10 mg/ml in Me2SO; i.e. about 30 mm) was from Sigma (catalog no. C1530), BHQ (stock solution was 22 mg/ml in Me2SO; i.e. 100 mm) was from Aldrich (catalog no. 11,297-6), BeCl2 (stock solution was 991 μg/ml in 1% HCl; i.e. about 110 mm in about 300 mm HCl) was from Aldrich (catalog no. 20,698-9), and AlCl3 (stock solution was 100 mm) was from Sigma (catalog no. A-3017). Proteinase K (stock suspension was at 1.5 mg/ml) was from Roche Applied Science (catalog no. 745723). Formation of ATPase-Fluoride Complexes—Reaction of ATPase with fluoride in the presence of various metals was performed in buffer A (100 mm KCl, 5 mm Mg2+, and 50 mm Mops-Tris at pH 7 and 20 °C) supplemented with 250 μm EGTA, in the absence of Me2SO for Trp fluorescence measurements or in the presence of 20% Me2SO (v/v) for 45Ca2+ binding measurements; 1 mm KF was added, either alone (i.e. simply with Mg2+) or together with 50 μm BeCl2 or 50 μm AlCl3 (and Mg2+, present from the start). When Trp fluorescence was to be measured after the addition of fluoride, SR was present at 0.1 mg of protein/ml from the start; when 45Ca2+ binding was to be measured after preincubation, SR was generally added to the complete fluoride-containing reaction medium, at either 0.3 or 3 mg of protein/ml. To measure residual ATPase activity, aliquots were taken after preincubation for various periods and diluted into a standard ATPase assay medium containing 0.5 mg/ml octaethylene glycol monododecyl ether. Intrinsic Fluorescence Measurements—SR membrane vesicles were suspended at 0.1 mg/ml in the thermostatted and continuously stirred cuvette of a SPEX Fluorolog fluorometer (e.g. see Ref. 31Picard M. Toyoshima C. Champeil P. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 18745-18754Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar), and Trp fluorescence was monitored using an excitation wavelength of 295 nm and an emission wavelength of either 315, 330, or 355 nm. Bandwidths were 2 and 10 nm, respectively. 45Ca2+ Binding Measurements—45Ca2+ binding to Ca2+-ATPase was measured as previously described (32Orlowski S. Champeil P. Biochemistry. 1991; 30: 352-361Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar), using nitrocellulose Millipore filters to adsorb the ATPase membranes and including [3H]glucose in the 45Ca2+-containing buffer to serve as a marker of the amount of fluid trapped in the filter (and therefore of the amount of nonbound 45Ca2+, trapped in the filter together with bound 45Ca2+). The buffer for 45Ca2+ binding generally contained 100 mm KCl, 5 mm MgCl2, 100 mm Tes-Tris (at pH 8 and 20 °C), 20% (v/v) Me2SO, [3H]glucose, and 45Ca2+, as well as, in some cases, a small concentration of residual EGTA from the preincubation medium (for instance, in Fig. 4 experiments, 225 μm total 45Ca2+ and 25 μm residual EGTA; i.e. a free Ca2+ concentration of 200 μm). Tricine was avoided as a buffer, because Tricine binds Ca2+ with a significant affinity under our conditions (data not shown; see also Ref. 33Good N.E. Winget G.D. Winter W. Connolly T.N. Izawa S. Singh R.M. Biochemistry. 1966; 5: 467-477Crossref PubMed Scopus (2152) Google Scholar). Note that “nonspecific” sites (with respect to Ca2+-ATPase), including those inside the SR compartment if the vesicles are made leaky (e.g. calsequestrin), also contribute to the measured amount of bound 45Ca2+, especially at pH 8; this was minimized by working at 5 mm MgCl2 and in the presence of 100 mm KCl. Experiments in which 0.3 or 0.6 mg of SR protein was to be retained by the filter were performed with Millipore HA or GS filters, respectively. In the latter case, the smaller pore diameter (0.22 μm instead of 0.45 μm) results in a larger surface available for adsorption of SR membranes. Filters were not rinsed, and they were counted for both 3H and 45Ca2+ radioactivity. Background—As already mentioned in the Introduction, one of the ATPase intermediate forms during its catalytic cycle must have its Ca2+ binding sites opened toward the luminal side and simultaneously endowed with poor affinity for Ca2+, to permit Ca2+ release into an SR lumen already containing a high concentration of free Ca2+ (and therefore active transport of Ca2+). This ATPase form is usually described as the ATPase “E2P” form, and a major aim of the present work was to measure binding of 45Ca2+ to such a form. A first prerequisite for such measurement is availability of a membrane preparation in which the SR luminal side is made accessible to 45Ca2+ added to the outer medium. For this purpose, we used a Ca2+ ionophore (calcymicin, A23187) in most of our experiments (but not in all of them, to make it possible to discriminate between binding sites accessible from the cytosolic side and binding sites accessible from the luminal side). A second prerequisite is the availability of a tool allowing discrimination between binding of 45Ca2+ to specific sites on the ATPase and “nonspecific” binding of 45Ca2+ to other sites in the SR preparation. We chose to perform experiments in the absence or presence of TG, as TG is known, at least as concerns Ca2+ binding to an ATPase initially in the E2 form, to block or dramatically slow down Ca2+ binding to the ATPase high affinity cytosolic sites (15Sagara Y. Inesi G. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 13503-13506Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 16Kijima Y. Ogunbunmi E. Fleischer S. J. Biol.

J. 1992; 283: 525-529Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). Third, demonstrating Ca2+ binding to E2P is made difficult both by the transient nature of the E2P form and by its above-mentioned poor affinity for Ca2+. Thus, we chose to increase the stability of the E2P form by including Me2SO in the solution (34de Meis L. Martins O.B. Alves E.W. Biochemistry. 1980; 19: 4252-4261Crossref PubMed Scopus (181) Google Scholar) and to increase its affinity for Ca2+ by making the pH in the solution more alkaline (35Verjovski-Almeida S. de Meis L. Biochemistry. 1977; 16: 329-334Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). A recent report already made use of such conditions to try and measure the binding of Ca2+ to E2P (7Vieyra A. Mintz E. Lowe J. Guillain F. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2005; 1667: 103-113Crossref Scopus (3) Google Scholar). In our hands, however, even such conditions were not sufficient to make the experiments reliable, as judged from dephosphorylation experiments (see below). Thus, in addition to the above general conditions, but instead of using a genuine E2P form, we chose to use more stable ATPase forms, namely ATPase complexes with fluoride, which are thought to be potential E2P analogs and which can be formed in the absence of Ca2+ but in the presence of various other metals: either magnesium alone or, in addition, aluminum or beryllium (these complexes will be referred to below as E2·MgF4, E2·AlF4, and E2·BeFx). A few properties of these complexes have already been described, and two of them (E2·MgF4, E2·AlF4) have in fact already been crystallized (13Toyoshima C. Nomura H. Tsuda T.

Chem. 2002; 277: 13615-13619Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar). According to previous indirect evidence, it is in the fluoride complex formed in the presence of beryllium, E2·BeFx that the ATPase conformation is most similar to that of the E2P form and that its Ca2+ sites are most accessible from the luminal medium, as judged, in particular, from the highest efficiency of luminal Ca2+ for reversing the inhibition of this particular complex (24Danko S. Yamasaki K. Daiho T. Suzuki H. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 14991-14998Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). Trp Fluorescence Properties of Complexes of Ca2+-free ATPase with Fluoride (Especially E2·BeFx) in the Absence or Presence of TG or BHQ—To start with, the conformational properties of the various ATPase complexes with fluoride were examined with intrinsic fluorescence. It had been shown previously that the drop in intrinsic fluorescence typically observed upon binding of TG to Ca2+-free ATPase (17Sagara Y. Wade J.B. Inesi G. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 1286-1292Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) was significantly larger for E2P or the E2·BeFx forms than for either E2 or the other ATPase-fluoride forms (24Danko S. Yamasaki K. Daiho T. Suzuki H. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 14991-14998Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). Here, this point was investigated further. Fig. 1A first confirms the finding in Ref. 38Troullier A. Girardet J.-L. Dupont Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 22821-22829Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar that the addition of fluoroaluminate to Ca2+-free ATPase, leading to formation of an E2·AlF4 species, only induces a slow decrease in the overall fluorescence intensity of the ATPase and the finding in Ref. 24Danko S. Yamasaki K. Daiho T. Suzuki H. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 14991-14998Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar that the subsequent addition of TG quenches the fluorescence of this species only moderately, as initially described for E2 (17Sagara Y. Wade J.B. Inesi G. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 1286-1292Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Fig. 1B also confirms that the same addition of TG to E2·BeFx induces a much larger fluorescence decrease, as previously described (24Danko S. Yamasaki K. Daiho T. Suzuki H. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 14991-14998Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). But in addition, Fig. 1B reveals that formation of E2·BeFx itself results in significant Trp fluorescence enhancement, at a rate consistent with the rate of inhibition of ATPase under identical conditions (half-time of about 2 min in the absence of Me2SO; data not shown). After the formation of this E2·BeFx, complex, ATPase fluorescence was no longer sensitive to the addition of cytosolic Ca2+, as expected (see supplemental Fig. S1B). The fact that beryllium fluoride enhances ATPase fluorescence in the absence of Ca2+ contrasts with the fact that in the presence of Ca2+ and ADP, no such rise is detectable (see supplemental Fig. S1D), again despite the fact that aluminum fluoride, as previously described (31Picard M. Toyoshima C. Champeil P. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 18745-18754Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar), now triggers formation of an E1·ADP·AlFx form of high fluorescence (supplemental Fig. S1C). The rise in fluorescence observed upon the formation of E2·BeFx (Fig. 1B) was only observed in the presence of Mg2+ (data not shown), as expected from the Mg2+-dependence of ATPase inhibition in the presence of beryllium and fluoride (37Murphy A.J. Coll R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 23307-23310Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) (data not shown). Note that a rise in ATPase intrinsic fluorescence is also observed upon formation of the E2P (29Champeil P. Guillain F. Vénien C. Gingold M.P. Biochemistry. 1985; 24: 69-81Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar, 41Lacapère J.-J Gingold M. Champeil P. Guillain F. J. Biol. Chem. 1981; 256: 2302-2306Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Remarkably enough, this rise in Trp fluorescence was converted into a fluorescence drop in the presence of A23187 (calcimycin), used as an hydrophobic fluorescence quencher (Fig. 1D), whereas the large drop observed upon the addition of TG was wiped off. The drop in Trp fluorescence observed in the presence of A23187 upon formation of the E2·BeFx complex is reminiscent of the fact that a drop in the presence of A23187 or other hydrophobic quenchers was also observed upon formation of the genuine E2P phosphoenzyme (42Champeil P. le Maire M.

https://openalex.org/W1966912797,"The poly(A)-binding protein (PABP) is an important regulator of mRNA translation and stability. The cellular level of PABP is controlled by regulating its mRNA translation by a feedback mechanism. The important aspect of this mechanism is that PABP binds to an adenosine-rich cis-element at the 5′-untranslated region of its own mRNA and inhibits its translation. To assess the importance of controlling the PABP level, we studied the effect of PABP overexpression on the transcription profile using the microarray technique. In PABP-overexpressing cells, 19 mRNAs showed a reduction in cellular levels due to reduced mRNA stability, and one showed an increase due to increased mRNA stability. Among these mRNAs, the MKK-2 mRNA encodes the protein kinase activator of ERK1/2 kinase, which is involved in the phosphorylation of eukaryotic initiation factor (eIF) 4E. As a result, mRNA translation may be regulated by the cellular level of MKK-2. In this study, we show that the abundance of the MKK-2 polypeptide is reduced in PABP-overexpressing cells. In these cells, the levels of phosphorylated PABP, eIF4E, and ERK2 are also reduced. Treatment of HeLa cells with the MKK-2 inhibitor U0126 reduced PABP phosphorylation, suggesting that the phosphorylation of PABP is mediated by the MKK-2/ERK signaling pathway. Thus, a novel signaling pathway involving MKK-2 and ERK1/2 may down-regulate the activity of PABP and eIF4E by controlling their phosphorylation and compensates for the effect of excess cellular PABP.

Regulation of the rate of protein synthesis is important for the control of cellular growth and differentiation.

Although this model is widely accepted, it has not been proven to occur in vivo. In addition, if PABP is essential for mRNA translation, it is possible that PABP participates in mRNA translation by a yet unknown mechanism, as the presence of 3′-poly(A) (and thus circularization of mRNA) is not essential for translation initiation of capped mRNAs (7Kozak M. Gene (Amst.). 2004; 343: 41-54Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar, 8Both G.W. Banerjee A.K. Shatkin A.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1975; 72: 1189-1193Crossref PubMed Scopus (215) Google Scholar). PABP binds to the 3′-poly(A) track of eukaryotic mRNA. It also interacts with polypeptides involved in regulating the translation and stability of mRNA (9Bernstein P. Peltz S.W. Ross J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1989; 9: 659-670Crossref PubMed Scopus (297) Google Scholar, 10Caponigro G. Parker R. Genes Dev. 1995; 9: 2421-2432Crossref PubMed Scopus (232) Google Scholar, 11Wang Z. Kiledjian M. Mol. Cell.

Among the four highly conserved RNA-binding domains of PABP, the first two show specificity toward poly(A), whereas the third and fourth RNA-binding domains can also bind to poly(G) and poly(U) (13Burd C.G. Matunis E.L. Dreyfuss G. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1991; 11: 3419-3424Crossref PubMed Scopus (205) Google Scholar, 14Nietfeld W. Mentzel H. Pieler T.

The C-terminal region of PABP does not bind RNA, but can interact with other polypeptides and promotes oligomerization of PABP on poly(A) (16Melo E.D. Dhalia R. Martins de Sa C. Standart N. de Melo Neto O.P. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 46357-46368Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). The C-terminal region contains a highly conserved 74-amino acid-long PABC (for PABP C-terminal) domain that binds to the eukaryotic release factor 3 and two regulators of mRNA translation, Paip1 and Paip2 (17Kozlow V.

The ability of PABP to interact with eIF4G, Paip1, and Paip2 also resides within its RNA-binding domain (19Roy G. De Crescenzo G. Khaleghpour K. Kahvejian A. O'Coner-McCourt M. Sonenberg N. Mol.

Because of the important role of PABP in the initiation step of protein synthesis, a change in the cellular PABP level may affect not only the rate of protein synthesis, but also the protein expression profile of the cells. Therefore, control of PABP expression may be critical for cellular physiology. Accumulated evidences show that PABP expression is regulated primarily at the post-transcriptional level (21Thomas G. Thomas G. J. Cell Biol. 1986; 103: 2137-2144Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar, 22Adamou J. Bag J. Eur. J.

However, in some instances, transcription of the PABP gene can also be regulated (28Hornstein E. Harel H. Levy G. Meyuhas O. FEBS Lett. 1999; 457: 209-213Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). A number of studies have shown that regulation of cellular PABP levels is indeed important for embryonic development and growth control. For example, ectopic expression of PABP prevents maturation-specific deadenylation and translational inactivation of maternal mRNAs in Xenopus oocytes (29Wormington M. Searfoss A.M. Hurney C.A. EMBO. J. 1996; 15: 900-909Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). PABP overexpression also leads to defects in cell divisions in Schizosaccharomyces pombe (30Tallada V. Daga R.R. Palomegue C. Garzon A. Jimenez J. Yeast. 2002; 19: 1139-1151Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). Interestingly, in the early stages of cancer, an increase in cellular PABP levels has been observed (31Veralet M. Deregowski V. Denis G. Humblet C. Stalmans M.T. Bours V. Castronovo V. Boniver J. Defresne M.P. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2001; 283: 12-18Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar), suggesting a link between growth control and PABP levels. In this work, we studied the effect of PABP overexpression on cellular mRNA levels in cultured HeLa cells. We report here that 19 mRNAs showed 2–3-fold reduced cellular levels in PABP-overexpressing cells and that the level of only one mRNA (encoding the TIMP-1 polypeptide) was increased by ∼6-fold. We show that changes in the stability of these mRNAs in PABP-overexpressing cells were responsible for the observed effects on mRNA levels. One of these mRNAs that showed reduced levels in PABP-overexpressing cells encodes MKK-2. Because MKK-2 may regulate the phosphorylation of eIF4E via the ERK1/2 signaling pathway (32Roux P.P. Blenis J. Microbiol. Mol. Biol. Rev. 2004; 168: 320-344Crossref Scopus (1936) Google Scholar, 33Richter J.D. Sonenberg N.

Biol. 2004; 24: 6539-6549Crossref PubMed Scopus (411) Google Scholar), we studied how the stability of MKK-2 mRNA is affected by the cellular PABP level. We identified a novel MKK-2 mRNA stability control element that binds PABP. We show that, as a cellular response to excess PABP, the phosphorylation of PABP along with eIF4E was reduced. In addition, the immediate downstream target of MKK-2, ERK2 phosphorylation was reduced in PABP-overexpressing cells. Using a specific inhibitor of MKK-2, we show that the phosphorylation of PABP is regulated by the MKK-2/ERK1/2 kinase signaling pathway. We propose that down-regulation of MKK-2 expression to control the activity of PABP and eIF4E is a signaling mechanism of mammalian cells to override the adverse effect of excess PABP. Plasmids—A PABP cDNA clone (pHu73 plasmid) (35Grange T. Martins de Sa C. Oddos J. Pictet R. Nucleic Acids Res. 1987; 15: 4771-4787Crossref PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar) was digested with BamHI and SacII, which removed the first 263 nucleotides of the PABP cDNA containing the adenosine-rich autoregulatory region and released the cDNA insert from the vector (24Wu J. Bag J. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 34535-34542Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). The PABP cDNA fragment was cloned at the AvrII/BamHI sites of the pCMV-SPORT-β-gal vector (Invitrogen) from which the β-galactosidase coding region was removed. This vector was named pCMVΔPABP. A second PABP expression vector was created with the FLAG epitope tag (pCMVΔPABP-FLAG) at the N-terminal end of PABP using a synthetic double-stranded oligodeoxynucleotide. β-Galactosidase reporter constructs containing different regions of the 3′-untranslated region (UTR) of MKK-2 mRNA were generated by ligating double-stranded oligodeoxynucleotides with EcoRI/NheI sticky ends to the EcoRI/BamHI fragment of the pCMV-SPORT-β-gal vector. To synthesize N-terminally His6-tagged PABP, the cDNA was amplified by PCR using pQE primers. The forward primer (5′-aaaggatccaaccccagtgcccc-3′) contained a BamHI restriction site, and the reverse primer (5′-ctaaagcttaaacagttggaacacc-3′) contained a HindIII restriction site. PCR was performed using a PfuUltra Hotstart DNA polymerase kit (Stratagene) with an initial denaturing step at 95 °C for 5 min, followed by 33 cycles of denaturation at 95 °C for 1 min, annealing at 55 °C for 1 min, and extension at 72 °C for 2 min. The PCR product was digested with the appropriate restriction enzymes (Fermentas GmbH), purified on a 1% agarose gel using a QIAquick gel extraction kit (Qiagen Inc.), and cloned into the pQE80L prokaryotic expression vector (Qiagen Inc.). Transfection of Cells—Approximately 3 × 105 subconfluent HeLa cells grown on a 35-mm dish in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 10% fetal bovine serum were used for transfection. Plasmid DNA (2–3 μg) was incubated with 10 μg of Lipofectamine in 100 μl of Opti-MEMI (Invitrogen) for 30 min at room temperature before addition to the cells. Cells were incubated at 37 °C for 5 h with the DNA/liposome mixture in 1 ml of Opti-MEMI. Following incubation, 1 ml of growth medium containing 20% fetal bovine serum was added to the culture. After 12 h of incubation, the medium was replaced with fresh complete Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 10% fetal bovine serum. Analysis of RNA—RNAs from mock-, pCMVΔPABP-, or pCMVΔPABP-FLAG-transfected cells were isolated using a high pure RNA isolation kit (Roche Applied Science) according to the manufacturer's directions. Human cDNA microarrays (University Network Microarray Centre, Toronto, Ontario, Canada) were used to examine the changes in the gene expression profile during PABP overexpression in HeLa cells. An equal amount (15 μg) of RNA from either mock- or PABP-transfected cells was mixed with an oligo(dT)18 primer, a master mixture for reverse transcription (250 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.3), 375 mm KCI, 15 mm MgCl2, 5 mm dithiothreitol (DTT), aminoallyl-dUTP, and dNTP), and 20 units of reverse transcriptase (Invitrogen). Reverse transcription proceeded for 2 h, followed by hydrolysis of the remaining RNA with NaOH, and the cDNA was purified using a PCR purification kit (Qiagen Inc). The probe was precipitated using isopropyl alcohol and resuspended in 5 μl of water. Probes were labeled using Alexa Fluor CyDye during a 1-h incubation period, and the remaining CyDye was removed using the PCR purification kit, followed again by alcohol precipitation. The probes were mixed with hybridization solution (4% each calf thymus DNA and yeast tRNA in DIG Easy Hyb (Roche Applied Science)) and incubated in a prewarmed and prehumidified chamber at 37 °C for 18 h in the dark. Microarray slides were washed with decreasing amounts of salt and SDS (first wash, 2× SSC and 0.1% SDS at 42 °C for 5 min; second wash, 1× SSC and 0.1% SDS at 25 °C for 10 min; and third wash, 0.1× SSC at 25 °C for 1 min.). The slides were dried, scanned using an Axon scanner, and analyzed using R Package software (University of California, Berkeley, CA). Each RNA sample was analyzed on three microarray slides, and three independent transfection experiments were performed. The level of a specific mRNA in the sample was determined by comparative real-time reverse transcription (RT)-PCR using Rotor-Gene 3000 (Corbett Research Australia) (36Heid C.A. Stevens J. Livak K.J. Williams P. Genome Res. 1996; 10: 986-994Crossref Scopus (5040) Google Scholar). An aliquot of total RNA (1 μg) was reverse-transcribed at 50 °C for 1 h in a total reaction volume of 25 μl using SuperScript II reverse transcriptase (Invitrogen) and 150 ng of random primers. After the reaction, 5 μl of the cDNA sample was amplified by PCR in a total reaction volume of 25 μl using the Platinum SYBR Green qPCR SuperMix-UDG kit (Invitrogen) and 100 ng of the forward (sense) and reverse (antisense) primers specific to individual mRNAs (Table 1). Amplification was performed using an initial denaturation step at 95 °C for 4 min, followed by 40 cycles of denaturation at 95 °C for 20 s, annealing at 60 °C for 20 s, and extension at 72 °C for 20 s. The specificity of the PCR product was examined after the final cycle by generating a melting curve with a heating rate of 1 °C/s between 72 and 99 °C. The data were analyzed using Rotor-Gene 3000 software and the 2–ΔΔCt method. The relative expression values of all mRNAs were normalized to the β-actin mRNA level.TABLE 1Oligonucleotide primers for RT-PCRGene (GenBank™ accession no.)Sense oligonucleotideAntisense oligonucleotideZNF136 (BC006421)5′-CAAACTAAGGATGGTAGTCAGCG-3′ (23)aPrimer length is indicated in parentheses.5′-TGGTTCATGTCCACTGTGATCT-3′ (22)GAPDHbGAPDH, glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase; CF2, coagulation factor 2; α2-AP, α2-antiplasmin; PPARA, peroxisomal proliferator-activated receptor-α; RPL27, ribosomal protein L27; FTL, ferritin light chain; RPL39L, ribosomal protein L39-like protein; MT1F, metallothionein 1F; MCC, colorectal mutant cancer protein; β-Gal, β-galactosidase.

Open table in a new tab Measurement of the Effect of PABP on Cell Survival and Cell Divisions— To measure cell death, paraformaldehyde-fixed cells were stained with 4′,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole, and the nuclei were viewed under a fluorescence microscope. The cells were considered dead if the nuclei appeared fragmented and pyknotic, as described previously (37Wyttenbach A. Sauvageot O. Carmichael J. Diaz-Latoud C. Arrigo A.P. Rubinsztein D.C. Hum. Mol. Genet. 2002; 11: 1137-1151Crossref PubMed Scopus (428) Google Scholar). Approximately 200 cells were examined for each experiment. The cell-doubling time was determined by counting the number of cells in the culture after removing the cells from the plate by trypsinization at 12-h intervals. The cloning efficiency of trypsinized cells was determined by plating ∼100 cells on a 5-cm2 dish and counting the number of colonies after 4–6 days in culture. Measurement of Protein Levels—Forty-eight hours after transfection, cells were washed three times with phosphate-buffered saline and lysed in protein sample loading buffer (6% glycerol, 2% SDS, 100 mm DTT, and 0.02% bromphenol blue in 60 mm Tris-HCl (pH 6.6)) for 5 min. The polypeptides were separated by SDS-10% PAGE and electrophoretically transferred to a nitrocellulose membrane. After treating the transfer membrane for 1 h with blocking buffer (2% nonfat dry milk and 0.2% Tween 20 in phosphate-buffered saline), the membrane was incubated with a diluted primary antibody for 2 h at room temperature in blocking buffer and then incubated with an alkaline phosphatase-conjugated secondary antibody for 1 h. The bound antibody was detected with 4-nitro blue tetrazolium chloride and 5-bromo-4-chloro-3-indolyl phosphate as described previously (38Towbin H. Gordon J. J. Immunol. Methods. 1984; 72: 313-340Crossref PubMed Scopus (795) Google Scholar). In some experiments, a horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibody was used for detecting antigens by chemiluminescence using a Western Lightning kit (PerkinElmer Life Sciences) as described by the manufacturer. Expression and Purification of a His6-tagged Fusion Protein—Escherichia coli containing the pQE80L-PABP expression vector was grown to early log phase at 37 °C in LB medium (10 g of NaCl, 10 g of Bacto-Tryptone, and 5 g of yeast extract in 1 liter of H2O at pH 7.4) and induced for 4 h with isopropyl β-d-thiogalactopyranoside. The bacterial cells were harvested by centrifugation and lysed by incubation with 1 mg/ml lysozyme and lysis buffer (50 mm NaH2PO4, 500 mm NaCl, 30 mm imidazole, 13 mm β-mercaptoethanol, 2 mm MgCl2, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 0.5% Igepal CA-630, and 5% glycerol (pH 8.0)) at 0 °C for 30 min. The lysate was cleared by centrifugation, and the supernatant was incubated with nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid-agarose beads (Qiagen Inc.) in lysis buffer for 2 h at 0 °C. The beads were washed extensively with wash buffer (50 mm NaH2PO4, 500 mm NaCl, 50 mm imidazole, 13 mm β-mercaptoethanol, 2 mm MgCl2, 0.5% Igepal CA-630, and 5% glycerol (pH 8.0)). The bound protein was eluted with elution buffer (50 mm NaH2PO4, 500 mm NaCl, 300 mm imidazole, 13 mm β-mercaptoethanol, 2 mm MgCl2, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 10 μg/ml leupeptin, 2 μg/ml aprotinin, 0.5% Igepal CA-630, and 5% glycerol (pH 8.0)). The eluted fraction was equilibrated with storage buffer (10 mm HEPES-KOH (pH 7.5), 3 mm MgCl2, 140 mm KCl, 5% glycerol, 1 mm DTT, 0.02% Igepal CA-630, 0.5 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 10 μg/ml leupeptin, and 2 μg/ml aprotinin) using a Microcon YM-30 concentration column (Millipore Corp.). In Vitro RNA Synthesis—Different regions of MKK-2 mRNA were amplified by PCR using primers containing a T7 promoter (Table 2). PCR was performed using the PfuUltra Hotstart DNA polymerase kit as described above. The gel-purified PCR product was used as a template for RNA synthesis. The accuracy of the amplicons was confirmed by sequencing.TABLE 2Primers for synthesizing different regions of MKK-2 mRNAMKK-2 geneOligonucleotideMKK-2-(1400-1417) SaS, sense oligonucleotide; AS, antisense oligonucleotide.aatagaattcgtaatacgactcactatagggcagtggccgggctccctgMKK-2-(1631-1648) ASaataggatccgtaacctaaggaagcagaMKK-2-(1525-1542) SaatagaattcgtaatacgactcactatagggcgtggcggggcgacagcgMKK-2-(1549-1566) ASAataggatccAgaggagacccccgttccMKK-2-(1631-1658) SaatagaattcgtaatacgactcactatagggtctgcttccttaggttacaaaacaaaacMKK-2-(1644-1663) ASgctttttctctccctgttttgttttgtaacMKK-2-(1400-1462) SgatccagtggccgggctccctgcgtccgctggtgacctgcccaccgtccctgtccatgccccgcccgMKK-2-(1504-1513) SaatagaattcgtaatacgactcactatagggcctcacccctMKK-2-(1473-1482) SaatagaattcgtaatacgactcactatagggggacaggctgMKK-2-(1380-1399) ASaataggatcctcacacggcggtgcgcgMKK-2-(1180-1197) ASaataggatccggcagcttaggaggtggcMKK-2-(980-997) ASaataggatccgatggggtaccttccgacMKK-2-(781-797) ASaataggatccggatgttggagggcttcMKK-2-(580-597) ASaataggatcctagaagcccacgatgtacgMKK-2-(380-397) ASaataggatccgagttcgccgaccttggcMKK-2-(181-196) ASaataggatcccggggctccgcgggccMKK-2-(1198-1215) SaatagaattcgtaatacgactcactatagggcaacggtgtgttcaccccMKK-2-(998-1115) SaatagaattcgtaatacgactcactatagggcccccgcccgacgccaaagMKK-2-(798-815) SaatagaattcgtaatacgactcactatagggtcgtgaactctagaggggMKK-2-(598-615) SaatagaattcgtaatacgactcactatagggcggggccttctacagtgaMKK-2-(398-415) SaatagaattcgtaatacgactcactatagggaaagacgatgacttcgaaMKK-2-(197-214) SaatagaattcgtaatacgactcactatagggatgctggcccggaggaagMKK-2-(1-18) SaatagaattcgtaatacgactcactataggggcggctcgctcgcctcagMKK-2-(1494-1524) SaatagaattcgtaatacgactcactatagggcaccctcctgcctcacccctgcggagagcacMKK-2-(1463-1493) SaatagaattcgtaatacgactcactatagggttccagctgaggacaggctggcgcctccaccMKK-2-(1549-1566) ASaataggatccagaggagacccccgttccMKK-2-(1525-1542) SaatagaattcgtaatacgactcactatagggcgtggcggggcgacagcgMKK-2-(1507-1524) ASaataggatccgtgctctccgcaggggtga S, sense oligonucleotide; AS, antisense oligonucleotide. Open table in a new tab Transcription was usually performed at 37 °C for 3 h in a final volume of 25 μl containing 1 μg of DNA template, 2.5 mm each NTP, and 20 units of T7 RNA polymerase (Promega) in 20 mm MgCl2, 1 mm spermidine, 0.01% Triton X-100, 20 mm DTT, and 40 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.1). Uniformly radiolabeled RNA was synthesized under similar conditions in a final reaction volume of 25 μl containing 150 μCi of [α-32P]CTP (MP Biomedicals), and the final concentration of unlabeled CTP was reduced to 25 μmol. The contaminating nucleotides, incompletely transcribed products, and DNA template were removed by fractioning reaction mixtures on an 8% polyacrylamide gel under denaturing conditions (51Chang T.C.

The amount of RNA and its specific radioactivity were determined using a spectrophotometer (1 A260 nm unit = 40 μg/ml RNA) and scintillation counter, respectively. Preparation of Cytoplasmic Extracts—HeLa cells were grown on 100-mm dishes to 30–40% confluency and transfected with 25 μg of DNA as described above. Forty-eight hours after transfection, cells were harvested to prepare the cytoplasmic protein extract as described previously (39Thomson A.M. Rogers J.T. Walker C.E. Staton J.M. Leedman P.J. BioTechniques. 1999; 27: 1032-1042Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). In short, cells were grown to 90% confluency in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium, harvested by scraping in chilled phosphate-buffered saline (137 mm NaCl, 2.7 mm KCl, 10 mm Na2HPO4, and 2 mm KH2PO4 (pH 7.4)), and collected by centrifugation at 5000 × g. The cells were lysed in hypotonic buffer (10 mm HEPES-KOH (pH 7.5), 3 mm MgCl2, 14 mm KCl, 5% glycerol, 1 mm DTT, 0.02% Igepal CA-630, 0.5 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 10 μg/ml leupeptin, and 2 μg/μl aprotinin) by repeated passages through a 28-gauge needle. The cell lysate was centrifuged at 12,000 × g for 2 min at 4 °C to remove the nuclei and cell fragments, and the supernatant was stored at –85 °C in small aliquots. The protein concentration was estimated by the method of Bradford (40Bradford M.M. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 12: 248-254Crossref Scopus (217544) Google Scholar). UV Cross-linking Assay—For UV light-induced cross-linking assays, 60 μg of cytoplasmic extract or 1–10 ng of purified PABP was incubated with ≈2–3 ng (2 × 105 cpm) of radiolabeled RNA at 22 °C for 10 min in a total reaction volume of 30 μl in binding buffer (10 mm HEPES-KOH (pH 7.5), 3 mm MgCl2, 140 mm KCl, 5% glycerol, 1 mm DTT, 0.02% Igepal CA-630, 10 μg of E. coli tRNA, and 0.001% bromphenol blue). Heparin was added to a final concentration of 10 μg/μl, and the sample was irradiated by UV light (254 nm, 4000 microwatts/cm2) at 4 °C for 5 min. The sample was treated with RNase T1 (25 units)/RNase A (1 μg) at 37 °C for 5 min. Finally, the sample was boiled in protein sample loading buffer for 5 min and analyzed by 10% SDS-PAGE. The gels were vacuum-dried and autoradiographed. RNA Electrophoretic Mobility Shift Assay—20 μg of cytoplasmic extract was incubated with ≈1–2 ng (1 × 105 cpm) of radiolabeled RNA for 10 min at 22 °C in 18 μl of binding buffer.

We have already confirmed that the ACD activities are controlled by the suprachiasmatic nucleus (SCN), which is well known as the oscillator of circadian rhythm. Recently, it is reported that circadian oscillators exist not only in the SCN but also in peripheral organs. To date, it is unclear which circadian oscillators predominantly drive the daily fluctuations of hepatic ACD activities. To address this question, we examined the effects of restricted feeding, which uncouples the circadian oscillators in the liver from the central pacemaker in the SCN, on the daily fluctuations in hepatic ACD activities in male rats. Here we show that restricted feeding inverts the oscillation phase of the daily fluctuations in hepatic ACD activities. Regarding the hepatic P450 content, there were no fluctuations between the light and dark periods under ad libitum and restricted feeding conditions. Therefore, it is considered that the daily fluctuations in hepatic ACD activities are predominantly driven by the circadian factors in peripheral organs rather than by the oscillator in the SCN directly.

In most organisms on earth, many physiological processes exhibit daily rhythms under the control of an endogenous circadian timing system called the circadian clock (1Dunlap J.C. Cell. 1999; 96: 271-290Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2338) Google Scholar). In mammals, the central pacemaker is located in the suprachiasmatic nucleus (SCN) 2The abbreviations used are: SCN, suprachiasmatic nucleus; ACD, 7-alkoxycoumarin O-dealkylase; MCD, 7-methoxycoumarin O-dealkylase; ECD, 7-ethoxycoumarin O-dealkylase; PCD, 7-propoxycoumarin O-dealkylase; ZT, zeitgeber time. 2The abbreviations used are: SCN, suprachiasmatic nucleus; ACD, 7-alkoxycoumarin O-dealkylase; MCD, 7-methoxycoumarin O-dealkylase; ECD, 7-ethoxycoumarin O-dealkylase; PCD, 7-propoxycoumarin O-dealkylase; ZT, zeitgeber time. of the hypothalamus (2Rusak B.

Science. 1990; 247: 975-978Crossref PubMed Scopus (1402) Google Scholar). The SCN, which consists of ∼20,000 neurons, receives light signals via the retino-hypothalamic tract to entrain the central oscillator to the environmental light-dark cycle (4Reppert S.M. Weaver D.R. Nature. 2002; 418: 935-941Crossref PubMed Scopus (3328) Google Scholar, 5Hirota T. Fukada Y. Zool. Sci. (Tokyo). 2004; 21: 359-368Crossref PubMed Scopus (196) Google Scholar, 6Inouye S.T. Shibata S. Neurosci. Res. 1994; 20: 109-130Crossref PubMed Scopus (183) Google Scholar). The intracellular circadian oscillations rely on multiple clock genes forming a transcription/translation-based negative feedback loop (4Reppert S.M. Weaver D.R. Nature. 2002; 418: 935-941Crossref PubMed Scopus (3328) Google Scholar, 5Hirota T. Fukada Y. Zool. Sci. (Tokyo). 2004; 21: 359-368Crossref PubMed Scopus (196) Google Scholar). Two basic helix-loop-helix-PAS (Period-Arnt-Single-minded) transcription factors, CLOCK and BMAL1, activate the transcription of three Period genes (Per1, Per2, and Per3) and two Cryptochrome genes (Cry1 and Cry2) by interacting with enhancer elements termed E boxes. The resultant PER and CRY proteins inhibit the CLOCK-BMAL1-dependent transcriptional activation, closing the negative feedback loop. Circadian oscillators exist not only in the SCN but also in peripheral organs such as the liver, heart, and kidney (7Balsalobre A. Damiola F. Schibler U. Cell. 1998; 93: 929-937Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1548) Google Scholar, 8Yamazaki S. Numano R. Abe M. Hida A. Takahashi R. Ueda M. Block G.D. Sakaki Y. Menaker M. Tei H. Science. 2000; 288: 682-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (1479) Google Scholar). The oscillation phases of the peripheral oscillators are entrained by the central oscillator in the SCN directly and indirectly via neural, humoral, and other signals (4Reppert S.M. Weaver D.R. Nature. 2002; 418: 935-941Crossref PubMed Scopus (3328) Google Scholar, 5Hirota T. Fukada Y. Zool. Sci. (Tokyo). 2004; 21: 359-368Crossref PubMed Scopus (196) Google Scholar, 9Schibler U. Sassone-Corsi P. Cell. 2002; 111: 919-922Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (601) Google Scholar). Feeding signal elicits entrainment cues that act specifically on the peripheral oscillators such as the liver but are ineffective for resetting the time of the central oscillator (10Stokkan K.A. Yamazaki S. Tei H. Sakaki Y. Menaker M. Science. 2001; 291: 490-493Crossref PubMed Scopus (1349) Google Scholar, 11Damiola F. Le Minh N. Preitner N. Kornmann B. Fleury-Olela F. Schibler U. Genes Dev. 2000; 14: 2950-2961Crossref PubMed Scopus (1721) Google Scholar). Therefore, restricted feeding during the light period can completely uncouple the peripheral oscillators from the central oscillator in nocturnal rodents such as rats and mice. The metabolism and elimination of xenobiotics is mainly mediated by cytochrome P450 enzymes (EC 1.14.14.1), aided by conjugative enzymes and transport proteins (12Honkakoski P. Sueyoshi T. Negishi M. Ann. Med. 2003; 35: 172-182Crossref PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar). Many hydrophobic compounds are biotransformed into more hydrophilic metabolites through the mixed-function oxidase system. P450 enzymes constitute a superfamily of heme-thiolate enzymes that are expressed throughout the phylogenetic spectrum (13Lewis D.F. Pharmacogenomics. 2004; 5: 305-318Crossref PubMed Scopus (221) Google Scholar). This superfamily of P450 enzymes has been well characterized in rats, and the majority of the enzymes are present in families CYP1 to CYP4 (14Mugford C.A. Kedderis G.L. Drug Metab. Rev. 1998; 30: 441-498Crossref PubMed Scopus (203) Google Scholar, 15Soucek P. Gut I. Xenobiotica. 1992; 22: 83-103Crossref PubMed Scopus (247) Google Scholar). The monooxygenase activities of these P450 enzymes can be evaluated totally as 7-alkoxycoumarin O-dealkylase (ACD) activities (7-methoxycoumarin O-dealkylase (MCD), 7-ethoxycoumarin O-dealkylase (ECD), and 7-propoxycoumarin O-dealkylase (PCD) activities, respectively) due to the low isoform specificity of the substrates (16Okuno H. Nakanishi S. Kitao Y. Takasu M. Murase T. Shiozaki Y. Sameshima Y. Jpn. J. Pharmacol. 1989; 50: 1-9Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar). The ACD activities in the liver show obvious daily fluctuations in male rats with high values during the dark period and low values during the light period (17Furukawa T. Manabe S. Ohashi Y. Sharyo S. Kimura K. Mori Y. Toxicol. Lett. 1999; 108: 11-16Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar, 18Furukawa T. Manabe S. Watanabe T. Sehata S. Sharyo S. Okada T. Mori Y. Arch. Toxicol. 1999; 73: 367-372Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar, 19Furukawa T. Manabe S. Watanabe T. Sharyo S. Mori Y. Toxicol. Appl. Pharmacol. 1999; 161: 219-224Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). The daily fluctuations in the hepatic ACD activities are completely eliminated in SCN-lesioned rats (18Furukawa T. Manabe S. Watanabe T. Sehata S. Sharyo S. Okada T. Mori Y. Arch. Toxicol. 1999; 73: 367-372Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar). In addition, the daily fluctuations are observed not only under ad libitum feeding conditions but also under fasting conditions (17Furukawa T. Manabe S. Ohashi Y. Sharyo S. Kimura K. Mori Y. Toxicol. Lett. 1999; 108: 11-16Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar). These results indicate that the central oscillator in the SCN controls the daily fluctuations in hepatic ACD activities. However, it is unclear from these results whether or not the daily fluctuations in hepatic ACD activities are directly driven by the central oscillator in the SCN. To address this question, we examined the effects of restricted feeding during the light period on the daily fluctuations in hepatic ACD activities in male rats. In addition, we investigated the effects of restricted feeding on the gene expression profiles of periodic genes in the liver to understand the underlying mechanism using microarray. Animal Handling and Sample Preparation—Male F344/DuCrj rats (n = 30) aged 7 weeks were purchased from Charles River Japan, Inc. (Kanagawa, Japan). The animals were caged individually in an animal room controlled at a room temperature of 23 ± 3 °C, relative humidity of 55 ± 15% and ventilated 10–15 times/h with 12 h light/dark cycles (ZT, zeitgeber time; ZT0, light on; ZT12, light off). For 7 days before the start of the restricted feeding regimen, all the animals were allowed free access to tap water and a solid feed (Certified Rodent Diet 5002: PMI Nutrition International, Inc., Tokyo, Japan) sterilized by radiation (irradiated with a 60Co-γ-ray of 30 kGy). The animals were assigned to two groups (n = 15/group) 3 days before the start of the restricted feeding regimen. On the day of group allocation, the animals were weighed and assigned to each group so that the group means and variances for body weight were almost equal. Fifteen animals of one group were reared under ad libitum feeding conditions, whereas 15 animals of the other group were reared under 8-h restricted feeding conditions (feeding time: ZT2 to ZT10) for at least 8 consecutive days. The restricted feeding conditions were selected with reference to the report (10Stokkan K.A. Yamazaki S. Tei H. Sakaki Y. Menaker M. Science. 2001; 291: 490-493Crossref PubMed Scopus (1349) Google Scholar). Free access to water was given throughout the study. Body weight and daily food consumption were measured to examine the effects of the 8-h restricted feeding regimen. Finally, six animals in each group were sacrificed at ZT6 and ZT18. The left lateral lobes of the liver of each animal were dissected and immediately frozen in liquid nitrogen. The liver samples were stored at about –80 °C until use. All animal procedures were approved by the Animal Care and Use Committee of Sankyo Co., Ltd. Measurements of ACD Activities and P450 Content—The thawed liver samples were mixed with 1.15% potassium chloride of 3-fold volume of the sample and homogenized on ice. The homogenate was centrifuged at 9,000 × g for 20 min at 4 °C, and the supernatant fraction was further centrifuged at 105,000 × g for 1 h at 4 °C. The obtained precipitate was suspended with 1.15% potassium chloride of equal volume of each supernatant and centrifuged at 105,000 × g for 1 h at 4°C again. The resultant precipitate was resuspended with 1.15% potassium chloride containing 20% glycerol of equal volume of each supernatant and used as the microsomal fraction. 7-Methoxycoumarin, 7-ethoxycoumarin, and 7-hydroxycoumarin were purchased from Aldrich. The 7-propoxycoumarin was synthesized as previously described (20Matsubara T. Otsubo S. Yoshihara E. Touchi A. Jpn. J. Pharmacol. 1983; 33: 41-56Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Using these substrates, the MCD, ECD, and PCD activities were measured in the microsomal fractions by the method of Matsubara et al. (20Matsubara T. Otsubo S. Yoshihara E. Touchi A. Jpn. J. Pharmacol. 1983; 33: 41-56Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The P450 content and protein concentrations in the microsomal fractions were determined by the methods of Omura and Sato (21Omura T. Sato R. J. Biol. Chem. 1964; 239: 2379-2385Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and Lowry et al. (22Lowry O.H. Rosebrough N.J. Farr A.L. Randall R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1951; 193: 265-275Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), respectively. Microarray Analysis—Total RNA was isolated from the liver sample using the RNeasy mini kit (Qiagen, Valencia, CA). The RNA samples were prepared from six animals sacrificed at each time point (ZT6 and ZT18) in each group. They were pooled using equal amounts from each animal to make a total of 5 μg of RNA. The pooled samples were used as starting material. The cDNA was synthesized using the one-cycle cDNA synthesis kit (Affymetrix Inc., Santa Clara, CA). The biotin-labeled cRNA was transcribed using the GeneChip expression 3′-amplification reagents for in vitro transcription labeling (Affymetrix Inc.). Labeled cRNA was hybridized to GeneChip rat expression array 230A (Affymetrix Inc.) at 45 °C for 16 h. The array was washed and stained using Fluidics Station (Affymetrix Inc.) and scanned with a GeneArray scanner (Hewlett-Packard, Palo Alto, CA). The microarray imaging data were analyzed with Microarray Suite version 5.0 (Affymetrix Inc.), followed by Spotfire (Spotfire, Somerville, MA). In the comparison analysis between two arrays, we eliminated the transcripts, which had been assigned a difference call of “no change.” The thresholds of Signal Log Ratio for up-regulation and down-regulation were set at 1 and –1, respectively. These correspond to a fold change of >2 for up-regulation and <2 for down-regulation, respectively. We excluded transcripts whose Detection was “absent” in all the experimental data sets. Quantitative Real-time PCR—TaqMan real-time PCR (23Gibson U.E. Heid C.A. Williams P.M. Genome Res. 1996; 6: 995-1001Crossref PubMed Scopus (1770) Google Scholar, 24Heid C.A. Stevens J. Livak K.J. Williams P.M. Genome Res. 1996; 6: 986-994Crossref PubMed Scopus (4979) Google Scholar) was conducted individually for selected genes to confirm the microarray analysis data. The total RNA was treated with DNase I (Takara, Shiga, Japan) in the manufacturer's buffer to which was added RNase inhibitor (Toyobo, Osaka, Japan) for 20 min at 37 °C. After the phenol-chloroform purification, the DNA-free total RNA was reverse-transcribed into first-strand cDNA using Superscript II (Invitrogen) in the manufacturer's buffer supplemented with 10 mm dithiothreitol, 0.5 mm deoxyribonucleoside triphosphates, and 40 units of RNase inhibitor (Toyobo). Quantitative real-time PCR reactions were performed using quantitative real-time PCR Mastermix Plus (Eurogentec, Philadelphia, PA) on an ABI Prism 7500 (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA). The following probes and primers were designed using ABI PrimerExpress software (Applied Biosystems): for P450 oxidoreductase, 5′-CCCCTTCGATGCTAAGAATCC-3′ (forward), 5′-CGCTCAGTGCCTTGGTTCA-3′ (reverse), and 5′-TTCCTGGCTGCTGTCACCGCC-3′ (probe); for Per2,5′-AGCATCCAGTCCTGTTTTCTTTAGA-3′ (forward), 5′-ATCGCACAAACTCTGAGAGCTTATT-3′ (reverse), and 5′-CACGGGTGTCCTGAGACTTTCTCTATTTGAAACT-3′ (probe); for Cyp7a1,5′-CGCCCTAGCGACTGGATTAG-3′ (forward), 5′-GGCCCCAGCTATGTGAACAC-3′ (reverse), and 5′-AGAACTTTGTTCTCGCTGCCCACATTCC-3′ (probe); and for Dec1,5′-GCTTCCAGGAAACCATTGGA-3′ (forward), 5′-GGCTAGGAAGCTGGGCTTCT-3′ (reverse), and 5′-TCAGCTCCCAAACCCGTGGAC-3′ (probe). All probes were 5′-labeled with 6-carboxyfluorescein and 3′-labeled with 6-carboxytetramethylrhodamine. The program was 50 °C for 2 min and 95 °C for 10 min, with amplification in 40 cycles of 95 °C for 15 s and 60 °C for 1 min. Glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (primers and probes from Applied Biosystems) was used as an endogenous control. Statistical Analysis—Results are expressed as mean ± S.D. The homogeneity of variance was estimated by the F-test; and significant difference of the mean value was evaluated by the Student's t test (for homogeneous data) or the Aspin-Welch's t test (for heterogeneous data) (25Yoshimura I. Statistical Analysis of Toxicity and Drug Efficacy Data. Scientist Inc., Chiyodaku, Tokyo, Japan1987: 28-40Google Scholar). Statistical analysis was performed with SAS System version 6.1.2 (SAS Institute Inc.). The 5% level of probability was considered to be significant. Body Weight and Daily Food Consumption—Being nocturnal, rats prefer to consume food during the active dark period if reared under a 12-h light-dark cycle and ad libitum feeding conditions. Therefore, an 8-h restricted feeding regimen during the light period only is a nonphysiological condition for rats. We examined the effects of an 8-h restricted feeding regimen (feeding time: ZT2 to ZT10) on body weight and daily food consumption. As expected, the restricted feeding significantly suppressed body weight (Fig. 1A) and daily food consumption (Fig. 1B). Suppressed daily food consumption gradually recovered during the 1-week restricted feeding, although significant differences were still detected on Day 7 (Fig. 1B). Day/Night Fluctuations of Hepatic ACD Activities—In male rats fed ad libitum, the hepatic ACD activities show obvious daily fluctuations with high values during the dark period and low values during the light period (17Furukawa T. Manabe S. Ohashi Y. Sharyo S. Kimura K. Mori Y. Toxicol. Lett. 1999; 108: 11-16Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar, 18Furukawa T. Manabe S. Watanabe T. Sehata S. Sharyo S. Okada T. Mori Y. Arch. Toxicol. 1999; 73: 367-372Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar, 19Furukawa T. Manabe S. Watanabe T. Sharyo S. Mori Y. Toxicol. Appl. Pharmacol. 1999; 161: 219-224Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). Consistent with the previous reports, the hepatic MCD, ECD, and PCD activities during the dark period were significantly higher than those during the light period in the ad libitum fed rats (Fig. 2A). In contrast, the hepatic ACD activities during the dark period were lower than those during the light period in rats exposed to the restricted feeding, and the ECD and PCD activities showed significant differences (Fig. 2B). Regarding the hepatic P450 content, there were no fluctuations between the light and dark periods in rats reared under ad libitum or restricted feeding conditions (Fig. 2C). Gene Expression Profiling—To identify transcripts whose signal intensities show day/night fluctuations, we compared an array in the dark period (as an experimental array) with one in the light period (as a base-line array) under each of the feeding conditions. In this comparison analysis, we extracted transcripts whose fold change between the light and dark periods is greater than 2 for up-regulation and less than 2 for down-regulation under each of the feeding conditions. Under the ad libitum feeding conditions, 118 transcripts were up-regulated and 104 transcripts were down-regulated in the dark period as compared with the light period. Under the restricted feeding conditions, 103 transcripts were up-regulated and 135 transcripts were down-regulated in the dark period as compared with the light period. When analyzing microarray data, the Venn diagram is a useful visualization tool to indicate the extent of overlap between multiple experiments (26Smid M. Dorssers L.C. Jenster G. Bioinformatics. 2003; 19: 2065-2071Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). The number of transcripts whose day/night fluctuations were not inverted by restricted feeding was only 1 expressed sequence tag (GenBank™ accession number AY724532) (Fig. 3A). In contrast, transcripts whose day/night fluctuations were inverted by restricted feeding were 72 (overlapping transcripts) in total number (Fig. 3B). However, there is a possibility that these 72 transcripts included transcripts whose transcriptional phases were moderately shifted but not inverted by restricted feeding. Therefore, a further robust sorting was needed to extract transcripts whose day/night fluctuations were completely inverted by restricted feeding. For this purpose, we further compared an array for restricted feeding conditions (as an experimental array) with one for ad libitum feeding conditions (as a base-line array) under each lighting condition. In this comparison analysis, we extracted transcripts whose fold change between ad libitum and restricted feeding conditions is greater than 2 for up-regulation and less than 2 for down-regulation under each lighting condition. In the light period, 153 transcripts were up-regulated and 157 transcripts were down-regulated by restricted feeding. In the dark period, 85 transcripts were up-regulated and 110 transcripts were down-regulated by restricted feeding. Following this, transcripts whose expression levels were inverted by restricted feeding were 79 (overlapping transcripts) in total number (Fig. 3C). Finally, we compared the 72 previously extracted transcripts with the 79 newly extracted transcripts to select transcripts whose day/night expressions were completely inverted by restricted feeding. As a consequence, 50 overlapping genes (58 transcripts) were extracted as genes whose day/night fluctuations in their transcriptional levels were completely inverted by restricted feeding (Table 1). The Gene Ontology Consortium data base was used to assign the molecular function of the extracted genes.TABLE 1Genes whose day/night fluctuations in their transcriptional levels were completely inverted by restricted feedingGene ontology annotation (Biological process)Accession no.DescriptionFold change (ZT18 versus ZT6)Fold change (restricted feeding versus ad libitum)ad libitumRestricted feedingZT6ZT18Ubiquitin cycleNM_053774Ubiquitin specific protease 2 (Usp2)13.0-4.916.0-4.6Circadian rhythmNM_031678Period homolog 2 (Drosophila) (Per2)11.3-9.210.6-8.6Regulation of transcription, DNA-dependentNM_052798Zinc finger protein 354A (Znf354a)11.3-2.110.6-2.6Electron transportNM_031576P450 (cytochrome) oxidoreductase (Por)10.6-2.87.0-4.0NoneAY035551Brain Ntab6.1-2.84.9-2.5Negative regulation of cell adhesionNM_022635N-Acetyltransferase 8 (camello like) (Nat8)5.3-7.57.0-5.7GlycolysisNM_012565Glucokinase (Gck)4.3-5.35.3-4.3Pyridine nucleotide biosynthesisNM_177928Pre-B-cell colony enhancing factor 1 (Pbef1)4.3-2.53.0-2.8NoneXM_343956Similar to hepatic leukemia factor (LOC363667)4.3-2.55.3-2.5Negative regulation of cell adhesionAF187814Putative N-acetyltransferase CML3 (Cml3)4.0-9.22.8-4.6Fatty acid elongationNM_134383Fatty acid elongase 2 (ELO2)4.0-4.64.3-4.6Proteolysis and peptidolysisNM_011638Transferrin receptor (Tfrc)4.0-2.33.0-2.6Bile acid biosynthesisNM_012942Cytochrome P450, family 7, subfamily a, polypeptide 1 (Cyp7a1)3.7-3.24.9-2.6GluconeogenesisNM_053962Serine dehydratase (Sds)3.7-3.73.7-3.7Circadian rhythmNM_012543D site albumin promoter binding protein (Dbp)3.5-21.113.9-7.0Regulation of cell migrationU61261Laminin-5 α3 chain3.0-3.52.8-3.7NoneXM_217393Similar to hypothetical protein FLJ13448 (LOC301416)3.0-2.53.0-2.1NoneXM_340774Similar to RIKEN cDNA 9530058B02 (LOC360499)2.6-2.02.6-2.0Protein foldingNM_024351Heat shock protein 8 (Hspa8)2.5-3.03.5-2.3Entrainment of circadian clockNM_053328Basic helix-loop-helix domain containing, class B2 (Bhlhb2; Dec1)2.5-4.32.8-3.2Glycogen metabolismNM_138912Protein phosphatase 1, regulatory (inhibitor) subunit 3B (Ppp1r3b)2.5-2.12.3-2.1Protein foldingNM_175761Heat shock protein 1, α (Hspca)2.5-4.03.0-3.0Protein foldingXM_213699Similar to heat shock protein 105 kDa alpha (LOC288444)2.5-2.63.5-2.1Carbohydrate metabolismXM_217254Interferon-related developmental regulator 2, predicted (Ifrd2_predicted)2.3-2.52.5-2.0Heme biosynthesisNM_024484Aminolevulinic acid synthase 1 (Alas1)2.1-2.52.5-2.3Steroid biosynthesisNM_024391Hydroxysteroid (17-β) dehydrogenase 2 (Hsd17b2)2.1-12.15.7-4.3Wnt receptor signalling pathwayNM_021594ERM-binding phosphoprotein (Slc9a3r1)2.1-2.82.3-2.8NoneBC051501Similar to hepatocellular carcinoma-associated gene TD262.1-6.13.5-4.0Glutathione biosynthesisNM_012815Glutamate-cysteine ligase, catalytic subunit (Gclc)2.0-3.22.5-2.8Negative regulation of microtubule depolymerizationNM_206950MID1 interacting G12-like protein (Mig12)2.0-2.52.1-2.1G-protein-coupled receptor protein signaling pathwayNM_173293Olfactory receptor gene Olr59 (Olr59)-2.14.0-3.52.1NoneXM_237312Similar to brain protein 17 (LOC316518)-2.13.2-3.02.3Fatty acid biosynthesisNM_053922Acetyl-coenzyme A carboxylase β (Acacb)-2.13.5-3.52.1Ergosterol biosynthesisNM_030996Opioid receptor, σ 1 (Oprs1)-2.52.3-2.82.0Response to sterol depletionNM_178091Insulin induced gene 2 (Insig2)-2.52.3-3.02.0Amino acid biosynthesisNM_017074CTL target antigen (Cth)-2.83.0-3.02.6Water transportNM_019158Aquaporin 8 (Aqp8)-2.82.3-3.02.1Protein transportXM_217179Similar to ClpX protein (LOC300786)-2.83.7-3.03.0Positive regulation of lipid metabolismNM_199115Angiopoietin-like protein 4 (Angptl4)-3.08.0-7.03.2NoneX03369β-Tubulin T β15-3.03.5-4.92.8Fatty acid metabolismNM_031987Carnitine O-octanoyltransferase (Crot)-3.22.1-2.82.6Activation of MAPKNM_053599Ephrin A1 (Efna1)-3.22.0-2.82.5NoneU53184Estrogen-responsive uterine-3.22.1-3.02.5NoneBC070514cDNA clone MGC:91567 IMAGE:7100462-3.52.1-3.22.3Pyridine nucleotide biosynthesisNM_053902Kynureninase (l-kynurenine hydrolase) (Kynu)-3.73.0-3.53.5Circadian rhythmNM_024362Aryl hydrocarbon receptor nuclear translocator-like (Arntl)-3.74.6-4.92.6Cell glucose homeostasisNM_013120Glucokinase regulatory protein (Gckr)-4.34.0-4.04.0GluconeogenesisNM_013098Glucose-6-phosphatase, catalytic (G6pc)-4.34.9-5.34.3Electron transportXM_239059Lysyl oxidase-like 4, predicted (Lox14_predicted)-4.62.3-2.14.9Neurotransmitter transportNM_017206Solute carrier family 6 (neurotransmitter transporter, taurine), member 6 (Slc6a6)-9.82.3-8.03.0 Open table in a new tab TaqMan Real-time PCR Confirmation of Microarray Data—To confirm the microarray data, mRNA expression levels were quantified by TaqMan real-time PCR analysis for four selected genes (P450 oxidoreductase, Per2, Cyp7a1, and Dec1). These mRNA levels showed significant day/night fluctuations whose oscillation phases were completely inverted by restricted feeding (Fig. 4, A–D). Fold changes observed were similar between microarray data and real-time PCR data. Therefore, the results of the microarray data were validated. In male rats fed ad libitum, the hepatic ACD activities show obvious daily fluctuations with high values during the dark period and low values during the light period (17Furukawa T. Manabe S. Ohashi Y. Sharyo S. Kimura K. Mori Y. Toxicol. Lett. 1999; 108: 11-16Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar, 18Furukawa T. Manabe S. Watanabe T. Sehata S. Sharyo S. Okada T. Mori Y. Arch. Toxicol. 1999; 73: 367-372Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar, 19Furukawa T. Manabe S. Watanabe T. Sharyo S. Mori Y. Toxicol. Appl. Pharmacol. 1999; 161: 219-224Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). The daily fluctuations are under the control of the central oscillator in the SCN, since SCN lesions completely eliminate the fluctuation while shifting feeding conditions from ad libitum to fasting dose not (17Furukawa T. Manabe S. Ohashi Y. Sharyo S. Kimura K. Mori Y. Toxicol. Lett. 1999; 108: 11-16Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar, 18Furukawa T. Manabe S. Watanabe T. Sehata S. Sharyo S. Okada T. Mori Y. Arch. Toxicol. 1999; 73: 367-372Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar). The objective of the present study was to examine whether or not the daily fluctuations in hepatic ACD activities are directly driven by the circadian oscillators in the SCN. Restricted feeding during the light period uncouples the peripheral oscillators from the central oscillator in nocturnal rodents (10Stokkan K.A. Yamazaki S. Tei H. Sakaki Y. Menaker M. Science. 2001; 291: 490-493Crossref PubMed Scopus (1349) Google Scholar, 11Damiola F. Le Minh N. Preitner N. Kornmann B. Fleury-Olela F. Schibler U. Genes Dev. 2000; 14: 2950-2961Crossref PubMed Scopus (1721) Google Scholar). Therefore, we examined the effects of restricted feeding during the light period on the daily fluctuations in hepatic ACD activities in male rats. Restricted feeding significantly suppressed body weight and daily food consumption. However, suppressed daily food consumption gradually recovered during the 1-week restricted feeding. The 1-week restricted feeding inverted the oscillation phase of the day/night fluctuations in hepatic ACD activities. However, there were no day/night fluctuations regarding the P450 content. There were 50 periodic genes whose day/night fluctuations were completely inverted by restricted feeding, whereas there were no meaningful periodic genes whose day/night fluctuations were not inverted by restricted feeding. This finding, in and of itself, does not demonstrate that hepatic ACD activities are under the control of any clock, central or peripheral. It only means that hepatic gene expression patterns change with feeding not with central circadian oscillations. However, our previous data demonstrate that SCN lesions abolish the daily fluctuation in hepatic ACD activities and that the ACD activities continue to oscillate based on the circadian clock when animals are fasted (17Furukawa T. Manabe S. Ohashi Y. Sharyo S. Kimura K. Mori Y. Toxicol. Lett. 1999; 108: 11-16Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar, 18Furukawa T. Manabe S. Watanabe T. Sehata S. Sharyo S. Okada T. Mori Y. Arch. Toxicol. 1999; 73: 367-372Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar). The latter finding is of particular importance because it shows that clock genes, not feeding, control the expression of metabolic enzymes in the liver. Therefore, the results in the present study suggest that the daily fluctuations in hepatic ACD activities are predominantly oscillated by the circadian factors in the peripheral organs rather than by the oscillator in the SCN directly. We have previously reported that growth hormone plays an important role in the regulation of the daily fluctuations in hepatic P450 monooxygenase activities (19Furukawa T. Manabe S. Watanabe T. Sharyo S. Mori Y. Toxicol. Appl. Pharmacol. 1999; 161: 219-224Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). Ghrelin, produced in the stomach, is the peptide hormone that stimulates feeding as well as release of growth hormone from the anterior pituitary (27Meier U. Gressner A.M. Clin. Chem. 2004; 50: 1511-1525Crossref PubMed Scopus (786) Google Scholar, 28Kojima M. Hosoda H. Date Y. Nakazato M. Matsuo H. Kangawa K. Nature. 1999; 402: 656-660Crossref PubMed Scopus (7178) Google Scholar, 29Nakazato M. Murakami N. Date Y. Kojima M. Matsuo H. Kangawa K. Matsukura S. Nature. 2001; 409: 194-198Crossref PubMed Scopus (2928) Google Scholar, 30St-Pierre D.H. Wang L. Tache Y. News Physiol. Sci. 2003; 18: 242-246PubMed Google Scholar). Therefore, ghrelin may be one of important regulators in the daily fluctuations of hepatic P450 monooxygenase activities. The clock gene expression in the liver may relay information from the SCN via the blood-borne signals to control expression of the hepatic genes involved in energy metabolism. A conditional knock-out of a hepatic clock gene should be a useful technique to understand the mechanism. As described in the review (31Rutter J. Reick M. McKnight S.L. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2002; 71: 307-331Crossref PubMed Scopus (324) Google Scholar), it appears that the apex of organ activity corresponds with the apex of the circadian oscillator activity. The oscillation phases of day/night gene expressions for the clock and clock-controlled genes such as Per2, Dbp (32Lopez-Molina L. Conquet F. Dubois-Dauphin M. Schibler U. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 6762-6771Crossref PubMed Scopus (246) Google Scholar), and Dec1 (33Noshiro M. Kawamoto T. Furukawa M. Fujimoto K. Yoshida Y. Sasabe E. Tsutsumi S. Hamada T. Honma S. Honma K. Kato Y. Genes Cells. 2004; 9: 317-329Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar) were completely inverted in the liver by the restricted feeding. The gene ontology analysis revealed that most of the genes that underwent complete reversal are involved in metabolism. In particular, genes associated with the major liver functions, including xenobiotic metabolism, regulation of blood glucose, and bile formation, show day/night fluctuations in their transcriptional levels which can be completely inverted by restricted feeding. First, the liver is the major site of xenobiotic metabolism. Xenobiotic metabolism is divided into two broad categories: phase I (oxidation, reduction, and hydrolysis) and phase II (conjugation reactions with sulfate, glucuronic acid, glutathione, acetate, and glycine). The P450 enzymes are involved in phase I metabolism, and glutathione is involved in phase II metabolism. P450 oxidoreductase (EC 1.6.2.4) and the catalytic subunit of glutamate-cysteine ligase (EC 6.3.2.2) exhibited day/night fluctuations in their transcriptional levels, and their oscillation phases of gene expression were completely inverted by the restricted feeding regimen. P450 oxidoreductase is the protein responsible for electron transfer from NADPH to the cytochrome P450 monooxygenases (34Lu A.Y. Junk K.W. Coon M.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1969; 244: 3714-3721Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Therefore, the day/night fluctuation of P450 oxidoreductase, the redox partner of P450 monooxygenases, may be one of important causes of the daily fluctuations of hepatic ACD activities. Glutamate-cysteine ligase is the rate-limiting enzyme in glutathione biosynthesis. Glutathione is an important intracellular peptide that participates in many critical cellular functions including antioxidant defense (35Lu S.C. FASEB J. 1999; 13: 1169-1183Crossref PubMed Scopus (751) Google Scholar). Second, the liver plays a major role in regulation of blood glucose. Several genes involved in glucose homeostasis exhibited day/night fluctuations in their transcriptional levels, and their phases of gene expression were inverted by the restricted feeding regimen. They included glucokinase, glucokinase regulatory protein, the catalytic subunit of glucose-6-phosphatase, and insulin-induced gene 2. Glucokinase (EC 2.7.1.1), a member of the hexokinase family, plays a key role in glucose utilization by stimulating glycolysis and glycogen synthesis in the liver. The activity of hepatic glucokinase is negatively regulated by protein-protein interaction with glucokinase regulatory protein, which is competitive with glucose (36van Schaftingen E. Veiga-da-Cunha M. Niculescu L. Biochem. Soc. Trans. 1997; 25: 136-140Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). Glucokinase is increased after feeding and is decreased by fasting (37Sharma C. Manjeshwar R. Weinhouse S. J. Biol. Chem. 1963; 238: 3840-3845Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In contrast, glucose-6-phosphatase (EC 3.1.3.9), which catalyzes the last step of gluconeogenesis, is induced by fasting and repressed by insulin, whose levels are increased in the post-prandial state (38van Schaftingen E. Gerin I. Biochem. J. 2002; 362: 513-532Crossref PubMed Scopus (335) Google Scholar). In addition, insulin-induced gene 2 is selectively down-regulated by insulin (39Yabe D. Komuro R. Liang G. Goldstein J.L. Brown M.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2003; 100: 3155-3160Crossref PubMed Scopus (246) Google Scholar). Consistent with these findings, the transcriptional day/night fluctuation of glucokinase was observed in antiphase to those of glucokinase regulatory protein, the catalytic subunit of glucose-6-phosphatase, and insulin induced gene 2 in the present study. Third, the liver is the major site of bile formation. Bile acids act as effective detergents necessary for the digestion and intestinal absorption of hydrophobic nutrients. CYP7A1 (EC 1.14.13.17), a liver-specific enzyme, is the initial and rate-determining enzyme in the classical synthetic pathway of bile acids (40Davis R.A. Miyake J.H. Hui T.Y. Spann N.J. J. Lipid Res. 2002; 43: 533-543Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). It is well established that bile acid synthesis and the expression of CYP7A1 show obvious daily rhythms with high values during the dark period in rats maintained on a 12 h light/dark cycle (40Davis R.A. Miyake J.H. Hui T.Y. Spann N.J. J. Lipid Res. 2002; 43: 533-543Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 41Noshiro M. Nishimoto M. Okuda K. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 10036-10041Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In the present study, CYP7A1 exhibited the day/night fluctuations in the transcriptional level, and the oscillation phase of gene expression was completely inverted by the restricted feeding regimen. Our data suggest that the daily fluctuations in hepatic P450 monooxygenase activities are predominantly driven by the circadian factors in the peripheral organs and not directly by the oscillator in the SCN. Recently, it was suggested that the circadian clock gene network plays an important role in energy balance (42Turek F.W. Joshu C. Kohsaka A. Lin E. Ivanova G. McDearmon E. Laposky A. Losee-Olson S. Easton A. Jensen D.R. Eckel R.H. Takahashi J.S. Bass J. Science. 2005; 308: 1043-1045Crossref PubMed Scopus (1885) Google Scholar). Further investigations will clarify the link among circadian gene networks, behavior, and metabolism in detail. We thank K. Muramatsu for her helpful assistance in sample preparation."
