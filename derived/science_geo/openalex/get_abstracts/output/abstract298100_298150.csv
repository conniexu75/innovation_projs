https://openalex.org/W2017756939,"Graphical perception is the visual decoding of the quantitative and qualitative information encoded on graphs. Recent investigations have uncovered basic principles of human graphical perception that have important implications for the display of data. The computer graphics revolution has stimulated the invention of many graphical methods for analyzing and presenting scientific data, such as box plots, two-tiered error bars, scatterplot smoothing, dot charts, and graphing on a log base 2 scale."
https://openalex.org/W1965435246,"The factors that determine climate response times were investigated with simple models and scaling statements. The response times are particularly sensitive to (i) the amount that the climate response is amplified by feedbacks and (ii) the representation of ocean mixing. If equilibrium climate sensitivity is 3 degrees C or greater for a doubling of the carbon dioxide concentration, then most of the expected warming attributable to trace gases added to the atmosphere by man probably has not yet occurred. This yet to be realized warming calls into question a policy of ""wait and see"" regarding the issue of how to deal with increasing atmospheric carbon dioxide and other trace gases."
https://openalex.org/W2072471257,"The 9 February 1971 earthquake in the San Fernando Valley damaged the Lower Van Norman Dam severely enough to warrant draining the reservoir. In March 1972 the sediment deposited on the reservoir floor was examined to determine whether the 1971 earthquake had induced sediment deformation and, if so, what types. A zone of deformational structures characterized by small-scale loads and slightly recumbent folds associated with the 1971 earthquake was discovered, in addition to two older zones of load structures. Each of the zones has been tentatively correlated with an historic earthquake."
https://openalex.org/W1979233386,"Radiation doses from airborne effluents of model coal-fired and nuclear power plants (1000 megawatts electric) are compared. Assuming a 1 percent ash release to the atmosphere (Environmental Protection Agency regulation) and 1 part per million of uranium and 2 parts per million of thorium in the coal (approximately the U.S. average), population doses from the coal plant are typically higher than those from pressurized-water or boiling-water reactors that meet government regulations. Higher radionuclide contents and ash releases are common and would result in increased doses from the coal plant. The study does not assess the impact of non-radiological pollutants or the total radiological impacts of a coal versus a nuclear economy."
https://openalex.org/W2071577982,"Geochemical methods used in exploring for oil and natural gas are based on the premise that hydrocarbons migrate upward from subsurface petroleum accumulations and produce anomalous patterns near the surface. Geochemical exploration techniques are both direct or indirect. Direct techniques require analysis of microquantities of hydrocarbons that occur in the free state in the soil interstices or that are adsorbed on the fine-grained portions of the soil. Indirect geochemical methods are based on the detection, in near-surface soils or in vegetation, of inorganic alteration products that result from upward migration of hydrocarbons."

Mangroves of the Florida Keys apparently are free of this wood borer."
https://openalex.org/W1982874188,The variation in sulfur dioxide emissions from nonferrous metal smelters in the western United States over a 4-year period is compared with the variation in sulfate concentrations in precipitation in the Rocky Mountain states. The data support a linear relation between emissions and sulfate concentration. The geographic separation of emissions sources and precipitation monitors indicates a sulfur transport scale exceeding 1000 kilometers.
https://openalex.org/W1977705778,"Dating by accelerator mass spectrometry of wooden artifacts, cord, and charcoal samples from Guitarrero Cave, Peru, supports the antiquity of South America's earliest textiles and other perishable remains. The new dates are consistent with those obtained from disintegration counters and leave little doubt about the integrity of the lower Preceramic layers and their early cultivars. Re-evaluation of the mode of deposition suggests that most of the remains resulted from short-term use of the cave in the eighth millennium B.C., with a possible brief human visit as early as 12,560 years ago."

https://openalex.org/W1978362503,"The Antiquities Act of 1906, which has provided the legal basis for protecting the U.S.'s prehistoric and historic heritage, is no longer adequate. Artifact hunters and collectors have descended on national forests and U.S. parks in ever-increasing numbers. The drafters of the 1906 act could not have anticipated the lucrative market in prehistoric artifacts in the 1970's. The act has come under attack in the courts as being unconstitutionally vague. In light of the recent criminal prosecutions under the Antiquities Act and the constitutional challenges, reviewed in this article, the authors propose a new Antiquities Act which expands the scope of the act to include those who would deal in artifacts taken unlawfully from federal lands and increases the criminal penalties for a violation of the act."
