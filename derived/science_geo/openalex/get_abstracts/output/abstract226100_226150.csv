https://openalex.org/W1982896164,"IT has been shown that the natural phenolic œstrogens produce fluorescence on being heated with phosphoric acid1,2. When applying this method to urinary extracts, it was found that a non-specific fluorescence obscures the readings for the œstrogens, especially in the ‘strong phenolic fraction’—the œstriol fraction. On attempting to purify the œstrogenic fractions of the non-specific fluorescence, we observed that a great part of it was non-phenolic, but was due to a ‘neutral’ substance or substances, which were carried over in the partition procedure then used (a modified Bachmann–Pettit method2) to the œstrogenic fraction."
