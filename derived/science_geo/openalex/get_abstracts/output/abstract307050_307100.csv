https://openalex.org/W2157575440,"Frugivory by extinct horses, gomphotheres, ground sloths, and other Pleistocene megafauna offers a key to understanding certain plant reproductive traits in Central American lowland forests. When over 15 genera of Central American large herbivores became extinct roughly 10,000 years ago, seed dispersal and subsequent distributions of many plant species were altered. Introduction of horses and cattle may have in part restored the local ranges of such trees as jicaro (Crescentia alata) and guanacaste (Enterolobium cyclocarpum) that had large mammals as dispersal agents. Plant distributions in neotropical forest and grassland mixes that are moderately and patchily browsed by free-ranging livestock may be more like those before megafaunal extinction than were those present at the time of Spanish conquest."

This submicrometer mode appears to be a general feature of coal combustion that results from a volatilization-condensation process in the boiler. At the boilers tested, the submicrometer mode contained 0.2 to 2.2 percent of the total fly ash mass. The importance of this mode is greater than its small quantity suggests because particles in the submicrometer size range are often much more difficult to collect with conventional particulate control devices than larger particles. Thus, the submicrometer mode may significantly influence the design and selection of future power plant emission controls. The particle mass in the submicrometer mode was correlated with the nitric oxide concentration in the flue gas. This correlation suggests that control of nitric oxide by modification of the combustion conditions may reduce the generation and emission of submicrometer particles."

Reduced toxicity observed in the absence of ultraviolet light is consistent with the known mechanism of photoinactivation of DNA by furanocoumarins through ultraviolet-catalyzed cross-linkage of strands. Thus, the ability of a plant to convert umbelliferone to linear furanocoumarins appears to confer broader protection against insect herbivores."
https://openalex.org/W2042301618,"White-tailed deer fawns continued to play despite an experimentally induced 33 percent milk shortage. They reduced play by 35 percent and general activity by 9 percent but increased grazing by 62 percent, resulting in virtually complete energetic compensation. This demonstrates the importance of play behavior in a mammal's activity budget."
https://openalex.org/W2051242740,"The ocean's role in the delayed response of climate to increasing atmospheric carbon dioxide has been studied by means of a detailed three-dimensional climate model. A near-equilibrium state is perturbed by a fourfold, stepfunction increase in atmospheric carbon dioxide. The rise in the sea surface temperature was initially much more rapid in the tropics than at high latitudes. However, the fractional response, as normalized on the basis of the total difference between the high carbon dioxide and normal carbon dioxide climates, becomes almost uniform at all latitudes after 25 years. Because of the influence of a more rapid response over continents, the normalized response of the zonally averaged surface air temperature is faster and becomes nearly uniform with respect to latitude after only 10 years."

Information on the mineral assemblages of such unsampled lunar surface material is provided by near infrared reflectance spectra (0.7 to 2.5 micrometers) obtained with Earth-based telescopes. The composition of the deep-seated material comprising the Copernicus central peak is unique among measured areas. Other lunar terra areas and the wall of Copernicus exhibit spectral characteristics of mineral assemblages comparable to the feldspathic breccias returned by the Apollo missions, with low-calcium orthopyroxene being the major mafic mineral."
https://openalex.org/W1969107283,"The net loss of plasma from blood into tissues within the ventilated reptile lung is 10 to 20 times greater than that in mammalian lungs. When blood flow is reduced during breathholding by reptiles, the plasma loss stops, and a net reabsorption of fluid from the tissues occurs. Fluid movement dynamics and the relative ""dryness"" of the lung of reptiles and mammals thus differ in several important respects and reflect the more variable cardiovascular performance of reptiles."
https://openalex.org/W2092524190,"Bombardier beetles of the carabid subfamily Paussinae have a pair of flanges, diagnostic for the group, that project outward from the sides of the body. Behind each flange is a gland opening, from which the beetles discharge a hot, quinone-containing secretion when disturbed. The flanges are curved and grooved and serve as launching guides for anteriorly aimed ejections of secretion. Jets of fluid, on emergence from the gland openings, follow the curvature of the flanges and are thereby bent sharply in their trajectory and directed forward. The phenomenon is illustrative of the Coanda effect, widely applicable in engineering and responsible for the familiar tendency of liquids to curve around spouts and down the front of containers when being poured."

All but two of the sources can be identified with visible stars. The strongest x-ray source is the star Theta(1)C, which excites the emission nebula. Its x-ray luminosity is 6 x 10(32) ergs per second. The rest of the x-ray sources may be identified with stars of all spectral types. Strong x-ray emission is not observed from members of the infrared cluster embedded within the Orion molecular cloud."
https://openalex.org/W2068004647,"A statistical analysis of the properties of dense interstellar clouds indicates that the solar system has encountered at least a dozen clouds of sufficient density to cause planets to accumulate nonnegligible amounts of some isotopes. The effect is most pronounced for neon. This mechanism could be responsible for much of the neon in Earth's atmosphere. For Mars, the predicted amount of neon added by cloud encounters greatly exceeds the present abundance."

No other trophic behaviors were observed, suggesting that the beetles are completely integrated into the termite's trophic system."

https://openalex.org/W2023938343,Controversial federal regulations requiring universities to report 100 percent of the activities performed by faculty members encounter severe theoretical difficulties of allocation that pervade accounting and that at present are insoluble. Yet it is only natural for universities and government agencies to desire that such allocations be made. Accounting practitioners have faced such reporting dilemmas for generations; their experiences suggest ways of palliating the federal requirements.
