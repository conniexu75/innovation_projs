https://openalex.org/W1774357523,A reinvestigation of the kinetics of hydrolysis of N-benzoyl-n-argininamide by crystalline trypsin has led to the conclusion that the hydrolysis products enter into the over-all reaction as inhibitors.

https://openalex.org/W104731562,"Lactobacillus arabinosus 17-5 has been widely used as an assay organism for nicotinic acid (NA) since the development of the method by Snell and Wright (1). Although it has been realized that other substances present in tissue extracts may interfere with the bioassay, the nature of such substances has not been elucidated. 

During an investigation of tryptophan metabolism in the pea plant, we studied the possible conversion of this compound to nicotinic acid, since such a transformation has been demonstrated to occur in numerous organisms (2-4). The method involved infiltration of tissue with large quantities of tryptophan and subsequent bioassay for nicotinic acid with Lactobacillus arabinosus 17-5. Certain anomalous results led us to believe that other metabolites of tryptophan were interfering with the assay. Because 3-indoleacetic acid (IAA) is a known plant metabolite of tryptophan (5), we tested it for possible interference with the assay, and, as described below, found that such interference may occur under certain circumstances."

https://openalex.org/W2123974635,IT is well known that the dust particles contained in moist air streaming with considerable velocity through a small hole towards a plane surface are deposited on it. This effect is currently used to determine the content of dust in the air by means of dust-counters. We thought it would be interesting to investigate in the same way the behaviour of atoms of radon and its disintegration products contained in air.

Rickes et al.2, have reported that the pure anti-pernicious an√¶mia principle (vitamin B12) isolated by them3,4 was a cobalt complex, containing as much as 4 per cent cobalt dry weight. Immediately after we had been informed about this extraordinary fact by Dr. Lester Smith of Glaxo Laboratories5, we started the present investigation. We were able first to show that all the amino-acids available to us (see table), with the exception of tryptophane, when treated with cobalt (II) chloride and hydrogen peroxide under suitable conditions, gave solutions the colour of which showed much resemblance to that of a sample of Lester Smith's preparation."
