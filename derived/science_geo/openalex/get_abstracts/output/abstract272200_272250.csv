https://openalex.org/W2018158276,"Amino acids dissolved in salt solutions may be concentrated and removed from the solution by ligand exchange on copper-Chelex 100 resin. Competing inorganic ligands do not interfere, and ion exchange with cations does not occur; thus loss of metal ion from this column is avoided. To test the potentiality of ligand exchange for chromatography, the type and nature of the dissolved amino compounds in sea water were investigated. The data revealed that the bulk of the dissolved amino compounds is present in a combined rather than a free state."
https://openalex.org/W2051271909,"The Fore people of the New Guinea Highlands classify all animals in one of nine higher categories (""tábe aké""), and these are further subdivided into lower categories (""ámana aké""). There are 182 lower categories for vertebrates alone. The nearly one-to-one correspondence between Fore amana ake and species as recognized by European taxonomists reflects the objective reality of the gaps separating sympatric species. In 90 percent of the cases, when a species of animal unknown to the Fore is presented for naming, it is called by the name of the Fore species considered its closest relative by zoologists. The origin of Fore classification is probably utilitarian."
https://openalex.org/W1990445884,"Aragonitic, unconsolidated sediments from the borings on the Eniwetok and Bikini atolls are isotopically identical with unaltered skeletal fragments, whereas the recrystallized limestones exhibit isotopic variations resulting from alteration in meteoric waters during periods of emergence. Dolomites and associated calcites are enriched in O(18), perhaps because of interaction with hypersaline brines."

https://openalex.org/W2062652958,"Lower Miocene microfossils occur in basaltic glass in two dredge hauls from the crestal area of the Mid-Atlantic Ridge near 30 degrees N. From the ridge and adjoining abyssal hills 43 pre-Pleistocene cores were identified, including one Cretaceous and four Eocene. Dredgings and cores now available suggest that the upper layer of the crust of the ridge is constructed of layers of interbedded sediments and basalt flows. The data rule out the possibility of large-scale continental drifting or spreading of the ocean floor since the Lower Miocene."
https://openalex.org/W2064673861,"The motion of the Project Echo communications satellite during its first 12 days clearly confirms previous predictions of the influence of solar radiation pressure. During this time, solar pressure reduced perigee height by 44 km. The approximate value of 1.1 X 101 g/cm5 has been obtained for the average air density at the 1600-km altitude of the satellite."
https://openalex.org/W1998019216,"Dredge samples and photographs from the Blake Plateau, off the southeast coast of the United States, indicate that a layer of manganese oxide forms pavement that may be continuous over an area af about 5000 square kilometers. The manganese pavement grades into round manganese nodules to the south and east and into phosphate nodules to the west. The Gulf Stream probably maintains a very unusual environment that prohibits deposition of clastic sediment and permits accretion of manganese pavements."
https://openalex.org/W1992208411,"The scent-gland secretion of the rice stink bug Oebalus pugnax (F.) is composed of a liquid two-phase system. The saturated hydrocarbon n-tridecane accounts for 60 percent of the secretion. In the other phase, the major organoleptic compound is the trans form of 2-heptenal."
