We report here the results of expression profile analyses and <i>in vitro</i> investigations that point to an interaction between dysferlin and the Ca<sup>2+</sup> and lipid-binding proteins, annexins A1 and A2, and define a role for dysferlin in Ca<sup>2+</sup>-dependent repair of sarcolemmal injury through a process of vesicle fusion. Expression profiling identified a network of genes that are co-regulated in dysferlinopathic mice. Co-immunofluorescence, co-immunoprecipitation, and fluorescence lifetime imaging microscopy revealed that dysferlin normally associates with both annexins A1 and A2 in a Ca<sup>2+</sup> and membrane injury-dependent manner. The distribution of the annexins and the efficiency of sarcolemmal wound-healing are significantly disrupted in dysferlin-deficient muscle. We propose a model of muscle membrane healing mediated by dysferlin that is relevant to both normal and dystrophic muscle and defines the annexins as potential muscular dystrophy genes."
https://openalex.org/W2062606765,"Proinflammatory prostaglandin E2 is known to sensitize sensory neurons to noxious stimuli. This sensitization is mediated by the cAMP-dependent protein kinase (PKA) signal pathway. The capsaicin receptor TRPV1, a non-selective cation channel of sensory neurons involved in the sensation of inflammatory pain, is a target of PKA-mediated phosphorylation. Our goal was to investigate the influence of PKA on Ca2+-dependent desensitization of capsaicin-activated currents. By using site-directed mutagenesis, we created point mutations at PKA consensus sites and studied wild-type and mutant channels transiently expressed in HEK293t cells under whole-cell voltage clamp. We found that forskolin, a stimulator of adenylate cyclase, decreased desensitization of TRPV1. The selective PKA inhibitor H89 inhibited this effect. Mimicking phosphorylation at PKA consensus sites by replacing Ser-6, Ser-116, Thr-144, Thr-370, Ser-502, Ser-774, or Ser-820 with aspartate resulted in five mutations (S116D, T144D, T370D, S774D, and S820D) that exhibited decreased desensitization as well. However, disrupting phosphorylation by replacing respective sites with alanine resulted in four mutations (S6A, T144A, T370A, and S820A) with desensitization properties resembling those of the aspartate mutations. Significant changes in relative permeabilities for Ca2+ over Na+ or in capsaicin sensitivity could not explain changes in desensitization properties of mutant channels. In mutations S116A, S116D, T370A, and T370D, pretreatment of cells with forskolin did not reduce desensitization as compared with wild-type and other mutant channels. We conclude that Ser-116 and possibly Thr-370 are the most important residues involved in the mechanism of PKA-dependent reduction of desensitization of capsaicin-activated currents."
https://openalex.org/W1993037429,"Peptidoglycan recognition proteins (PGRPs) are pattern recognition molecules coded by up to 13 genes in insects and 4 genes in mammals. In insects PGRPs activate antimicrobial pathways in the hemolymph and cells, or are peptidoglycan (PGN)-lytic amidases. In mammals one PGRP is an antibacterial neutrophil protein. We report that human PGRP-L is a Zn2+-dependent N-acetylmuramoyl-l-alanine amidase (EC 3.5.1.28), an enzyme that hydrolyzes the amide bond between MurNAc and l-Ala of bacterial PGN. The minimum PGN fragment hydrolyzed by PGRP-L is MurNAc-tripeptide. PGRP-L has no direct bacteriolytic activity. The other members of the human PGRP family, PGRP-Iα, PGRP-Iβ, and PGRP-S, do not have the amidase activity. The C-terminal region of PGRP-L, homologous to bacteriophage and bacterial amidases, is required and sufficient for the amidase activity of PGRP-L, although its activity (in the N-terminal Δ1–343 deletion mutant) is reduced. The Zn2+ binding amino acids (conserved in PGRP-L and T7 amidase) and Cys-419 (not conserved in T7 amidase) are required for the amidase activity of PGRP-L, whereas three other amino acids, needed for the activity of T7 amidase, are not required for the activity of PGRP-L. These amino acids, although required, are not sufficient for the amidase activity, because changing them to the “active” configuration does not convert PGRP-S into an active amidase. In conclusion, human PGRP-L is an N-acetylmuramoyl-l-alanine amidase and this function is conserved in prokaryotes, insects, and mammals.

Based on the predicted structures of the gene products, insect PGRPs have been grouped into two classes: short PGRPs (PGRP-S), which are small extracellular proteins (19–20 kDa), and long PGRPs (PGRP-L), which have long transcripts and are either intracellular or membrane-spanning proteins (1.Werner T.

Insect PGRPs have at least five known functions. Silkworm PGRP-S, Drosophila PGRP-LE, and probably other PGRPs recognize PGN and bacteria and initiate activation of the prophenoloxidase cascade, which generates antimicrobial melanin (4.Yoshida H.

Drosophila PGRP-SA, PGRP-LC, and PGRP-LE activate two different pathways that induce production of antimicrobial peptides. PGRP-SA interacts with the lysine-containing PGN from Gram-positive bacteria and activates proteases that generate Spaetzle, which activates Drosophila Toll receptor (6.Michel T. Reichhart J.-M.

Activation of Toll receptor induces production of drosomycin and other antimicrobial peptides that are mainly active against Gram-positive bacteria and fungi (6.Michel T. Reichhart J.-M.

PGRP-LC and PGRP-LE recognize the diaminopimelic acid-containing PGN from Gram-negative bacteria and Gram-positive bacilli and activate the “Imd” pathway that is Toll-independent and induces production of diptericin and other antimicrobial peptides that are primarily active against Gram-negative bacteria (3.Werner T.

Finally, Drosophila PGRP-SC1b is a PGN-lytic enzyme, N-acetylmuramoyl-l-alanine amidase (12.Mellroth P. Karlsson J. Steiner H. J. Biol.

Human PGRPs are differentially expressed in various tissues and organs: PGRP-S mainly in the bone marrow and PMNs, PGRP-L mainly in the liver, and PGRP-Iα and PGRP-Iβ mainly in the esophagus (13.Kang D.

Steiner H. Gupta D. Blood. 2003; 102: 689-697Crossref PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar). The functions of PGRP-L, PGRP-Iα, and PGRP-Iβ are not known. The C-terminal regions of all insect and mammalian PGRPs are highly conserved (14.Liu C. Xu Z. Gupta D. Dziarski R. J. Biol.

This region also has ∼18% identity and ∼33% similarity to bacteriophage T7 lysozyme, which is an N-acetylmuramoyl-l-alanine amidase, an enzyme that hydrolyzes the amide bond between the N-acetylmuramic acid and l-alanine of PGN (12.Mellroth P.

Mol. Life Sci. 2003; 60: 1793-1804Crossref PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar). T7 lysozyme is a Zn2+-containing protein, and Zn2+ is required for its amidase activity (18.Cheng X. Zhang X. Pflugrath J.W. Studier E.W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 4034-4038Crossref PubMed Scopus (203) Google Scholar). Four T7 lysozyme amino acids are required for its Zn2+ binding and amidase activity, and at least three additional amino acids are also required for the T7 amidase activity (18.Cheng X. Zhang X. Pflugrath J.W. Studier E.W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 4034-4038Crossref PubMed Scopus (203) Google Scholar). Out of 36 currently known insect and mammalian PGRPs, 12 PGRPs have all 4 of these Zn2+-binding amino acids conserved, and the remaining 3 amino acids are also either conserved or have permissible substitutions, and, thus are predicted to have amidase activity (Ref. 12.Mellroth P. Karlsson J. Steiner H. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 7059-7064Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (286) Google Scholar and this report). One of them, Drosophila PGRP-SC1b, was recently shown to be an N-acetylmuramoyl-l-alanine amidase (12.Mellroth P. Karlsson J. Steiner H. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 7059-7064Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (286) Google Scholar). Out of the four mammalian PGRPs, only PGRP-L has all of the above amino acids conserved and, therefore, it is predicted to be an amidase (12.Mellroth P. Karlsson J. Steiner H. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 7059-7064Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (286) Google Scholar). The objective of this study was to test this hypothesis and thus, identify the function of human PGRP-L. PGRP Constructs and Proteins—Human PGRP-S, PGRP-L, PGRP-Iα, and PGRP-Iβ and mouse PGRP-S were cloned in pcDNA3.1 and expressed in COS-7 cells as described previously (14.Liu C. Xu Z. Gupta D. Dziarski R. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 34686-34694Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (297) Google Scholar). Human PGRP-L deletion mutants were generated by PCR with the primers listed in Table I. Single amino acid substitution mutants of human PGRP-L, human PGRP-S, and mouse PGRP-S were generated using the site-directed mutagenesis kit from Clontech (Palo Alto, CA) with the primers listed in Table I. All constructs were subcloned into pcDNA3.1 with C-terminal V5 and 6xHis tags and analyzed by restriction digests and by sequencing as described previously (14.Liu C. Xu Z. Gupta D. Dziarski R. J.

Dziarski R. Methods Enzymol. 1994; 235: 253-285Crossref PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar). PGN was labeled with biotin on the N-terminal glycine of its interpeptide bridge, and its hydrolysis was measured as described previously (22.Dziarski R. Tapping R.I. Tobias P.S. J. Biol.

Complete loss of the biotin from PGN following digestion with lysostaphin (which is specific for the glycine bridge of S. aureus PGN) (Fig. 1) confirms that biotin was indeed bound to the N-terminal glycine of this uncross-linked PGN. PGN-biotin (750 ng) was incubated for 3 days at 37 °C with 10–50 ng of recombinant PGRP-L, PGRP-Iα, PGRP-Iβ, and PGRP-S, or their mutants in 35 μl of 75% elution buffer with 1 mm ZnSO4 (unless otherwise indicated), or with 10–200 ng of lysozyme (grade I from chicken egg from Sigma, St. Louis, MO) or lysostaphin (affinity-purified from Staphylococcus staphylolyticus from Sigma) as positive controls, or trypsin (type II from bovine pancreas from Sigma) or buffer alone as negative controls (22.Dziarski R.

Enzyme-digested PGN-biotin were subjected to SDS-PAGE, blotted on Immobilon-P, and high molecular weight PGN-biotin was detected with streptavidin-peroxidase and enhanced chemiluminescence as described previously (22.Dziarski R.

Separate aliquots of the digests (2 μl) were also analyzed by Western blot with anti-V5 antibodies as described (14.Liu C. Xu Z. Gupta D. Dziarski R. J. Biol.

To identify the bond hydrolyzed by PGRP-L, 50 μg of unlabeled PGN was incubated for 3 days at 37 °C with 250 ng of PGRP-L or in buffer alone (negative control) in 200 μl of 75% elution buffer with 1 mm ZnSO4. The digests were separated on a 5-μm Vydac 2.1 × 250-mm C18 HPLC column. Fractions were eluted with a 0–80% acetonitrile gradient over a period of 60 min. The fractions were collected and subjected individually to matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization time-of-flight (MALDI-TOF) mass spectrometry (MALDI-R, Micromass, Manchester, UK) as described previously (23.Xu N. Huang Z.-H. de Jonge B.L.M. Gage D.A. Analyt. Biochem. 1997; 248: 7-14Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar) with the only notable difference being that α-cyano-4-hydroxycinnamic acid dissolved in: 50% methanol, 50% acetonitrile, 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid (Sigma) served as the matrix. Time of flight was measured using the following parameters: 3,300-V pulse voltage, 15,000-V source voltage, and 1,850 multichannel plate voltage. For each spectrum, 100 laser shots were averaged. The spectra were calibrated externally with yeast alcohol dehydrogenase tryptic peptides. To determine the minimum structure of PGN hydrolyzed by PGRP-L, the following synthetic PGN fragments were used: muramyl dipeptide (MurNAc-l-Ala-d-isoglutamine, >98% pure by HPLC and mass spectrometry, from Sigma), GlcNAc-MurNAc-l-Ala-d-isoglutamine (>97% pure by HPLC and mass spectrometry, from Calbiochem, La Jolla, CA), MurNAc-l-Ala-d-isoglutamine-l-Lys, MurNAc-l-Ala-d-isoglutamine-l-Lys-d-Ala, and (GlcNAc-MurNAc-l-Ala-d-isoglutamine-l-Lys-d-Ala)2, the latter three were synthesized as described previously (24.Kusumoto S.

Five micrograms of each compound was incubated with 10 ng of PGRP-L or in buffer alone in 20 μl as described above for 48 h, and the digestion products were directly analyzed by mass spectrometry as described above. Bacteriolytic activity toward Micrococcus luteus (ATCC 4698), S. aureus (strain Rb), and Bacillus subtilis (ATCC 6633) was measured spectrophotometrically as described previously (15.Liu C. Gelius E.

Lysozyme and lysostaphin were used as positive controls and buffer alone as a negative control. Immunofluorescence—COS-7 cells or HepG2/C3A (ATCC CRL-10741) human hepatoblastoma cells were grown on glass coverslips and transiently transfected with human PGRP-L in a pcDNA.3 vector as described previously (14.Liu C.

For IF staining, the cells were washed with Dulbecco's PBS without Ca+2 and Mg+2, fixed with 2% paraformaldehyde (nonpermeabilized cells for cell surface staining) or with 2% paraformaldehyde with 0.1% Triton X-100 (permeabilized cells for intracellular staining) at 4 °C for 30 min, washed with PBS, stained with primary anti-V5 mouse monoclonal antibodies (5 μg/ml, from Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA), washed with PBS, stained with secondary goat-anti-mouse IgG-fluorescein isothiocyanate antibodies (Sigma), and observed in an IF microscope. The negative controls were cells transfected with an empty vector and stained as above, or cells transfected with PGRP-L as above and stained with the secondary antibody only (no V5 antibody). Both negative controls showed similar low level background fluorescence. Sequence Analysis—DNA sequencing and alignments were done as described previously (14.Liu C. Xu Z. Gupta D. Dziarski R. J.

Human PGRP-L Is a Zn2+-dependent N-Acetylmuramoyl-l-alanine Amidase—To test if human PGRP proteins have PGN-lytic activity, we assayed whether soluble polymeric S. aureus PGN, labeled with biotin on the N-terminal glycine, was degraded by recombinant human PGRP-L, PGRP-Iα, PGRP-Iβ, and PGRP-S. Only PGRP-L had PGN-lytic activity, similar to lysozyme and lysostaphin (positive controls), whereas PGRP-Iα, PGRP-Iβ, and PGRP-S did not, similar to buffer alone or trypsin (negative controls) (Fig. 1A). The kinetics of PGN-lytic activity of PGRP-L (Fig. 1B) was similar to the kinetics of PGN-lytic activity of lysostaphin, and ∼2–3 times slower than lysozyme (not shown). Because PGRP-L has sequence homology to bacteriophage T7 lysozyme, which is a Zn2+-dependent PGN-lytic amidase (18.Cheng X. Zhang X. Pflugrath J.W. Studier E.W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 4034-4038Crossref PubMed Scopus (203) Google Scholar), and because all four amino acids (His-411, Tyr-447, His-522, and Cys-530) corresponding to the Zn2+-binding amino acids (His-17, Tyr-46, His-122, and Cys-130) in T7 lysozyme are conserved in PGRP-L, we next tested whether Zn2+ was also required for the PGN-lytic activity of PGRP-L. Chelating divalent cations with EDTA completely inhibited PGN-lytic activity of PGRP-L (Fig. 1C). This activity was restored by 1 mm (or 0.1 mm, not shown) Zn2+ and was only partially restored by 10 mm Mg2+ (Fig. 1C). These results demonstrate that Zn2+ is required for the PGN-lytic activity of PGRP-L. The assay used in Fig. 1 detects conversion of PGN-bound biotin into low molecular weight fragments that migrate off the gel with the buffer front. Therefore, it measures degradation of PGN by several PGN-lytic enzymes of different specificities, including vertebrate lysozyme (which is a muramidase that digests PGN into disaccharide-peptides) and lysostaphin (which is an endopeptidase that digests a poly-glycine interpeptide bridge of S. aureus PGN). To determine which bond in PGN is hydrolyzed by PGRP-L, we next analyzed the products of digestion of soluble uncross-linked polymeric S. aureus PGN by PGRP-L using MALDI-TOF mass spectrometry. The peptides detected in PGN digests corresponded to the predicted (21.Rosenthal R.S. Dziarski R. Methods Enzymol. 1994; 235: 253-285Crossref PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar, 27.Schleifer K.H.

These results indicate that human PGRP-L is an N-acetylmuramoyl-l-alanine amidase (EC 3.5.1.28), which hydrolyzes the amide bond between the MurNAc and l-Ala of PGN (Fig. 2A).Table IIPGN peptides detected in PGRP-L digests of PGNPeptide[M + H]+Theoretical massObserved massAEKAA + G2603.31604.15AEKAA + G4646.31646.22AEKA + G5703.33703.527AEKAA + G5774.37774.32AEKAA + G6831.39831.48, 831.60 Open table in a new tab To determine the minimal structure of PGN hydrolyzed by PGRP-L, we next tested whether synthetic PGN fragments with peptide or glycan chains of various sizes were hydrolyzed by PGRP-L. The hydrolysis was measured by analyzing the digestion products using MALDI-TOF mass spectrometry. Muramyl dipeptide (MurNAc-l-Ala-d-isoGln) and GlcNAc-Mur-NAc-l-Ala-d-isoGln were not hydrolyzed by PGRP-L, whereas MurNAc-l-Ala-d-isoGln-l-Lys, MurNAc-l-Ala-d-isoGln-l-Lys-d-Ala, and (GlcNAc-MurNAc-l-Ala-d-isoGln-l-Lys-d-Ala)2 were all hydrolyzed by PGRP-L and yielded the expected peptides as digestion products (Fig. 2, B–D). These results further confirm the N-acetylmuramoyl-l-alanine amidase activity of human PGRP-L and demonstrate that MurNAc-tripeptide is the minimal structure of PGN hydrolyzed by PGRP-L (Fig. 2B). Incubations of human PGRP-L with intact bacteria (M. luteus, S. aureus, and B. subtilis) for up to 3 days at 37 °C did not reduce the optical density of bacterial suspensions (not shown). These results indicate that human PGRP-L is not bacteriolytic for intact bacteria, which is similar to insect PGRP-SC1b (12.Mellroth P. Karlsson J. Steiner H. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 7059-7064Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (286) Google Scholar), but contrasts with other PGN-lytic enzymes, such as lysozyme or lysostaphin, which are bacteriolytic and were used here as positive controls. Thus, although all these bacteria contain PGN that is potentially susceptible to amidase digestion, PGN in intact bacteria is not susceptible to or not available for digestion by insect and human PGRP amidases. Amino Acid Sequences Needed for Amidase Activity of PGRP-L—To determine which amino acid sequences are required for the amidase activity of human PGRP-L (and possibly other PGRPs), we compared the amino acid sequence of bacteriophage T7 lysozyme with the sequences of mammalian and insect PGRPs, including the amidase-active D. melanogaster PGRP-SC1b (12.Mellroth P. Karlsson J. Steiner H. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 7059-7064Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (286) Google Scholar) (Fig. 3). The sequences of both mammalian and insect short PGRPs and the C-terminal regions of long PGRPs are highly conserved and are homologous to the bacteriophage T7 lysozyme, which is a member of a family of bacteriophage and bacterial type 2 N-acetylmuramoyl-l-alanine amidases (Fig. 3). This homologous sequence is referred to as an amidase type 2 domain or PGRP domain and is subdivided into PGRP domains I, II, and III (Fig. 3) (14.Liu C. Xu Z. Gupta D. Dziarski R. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 34686-34694Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (297) Google Scholar). Based on this homology, the amidase domain of PGRP-L (containing PGRP domains I, II, and III) should be required and sufficient for the amidase activity of human PGRP-L. To test this hypothesis, we generated two PGRP deletion mutants and tested their PGN-lytic activity: Δ1–343 (N-terminal deletion) and Δ344–576 (C-terminal deletion of all three PGRP domains) (Fig. 4A).Fig. 4PGRP domains I, II, and III are required and sufficient for PGRP-L amidase activity and Cys-419, Tyr-447, and Cys-530 are required but not sufficient for the amidase activity.A, PGRP-L amino acid substitution and deletion mutants used.

https://openalex.org/W2156645430,"Most of the genes induced by hypoxia are regulated by a family of transcription factors termed hypoxia-inducible factors (HIF). Under normoxic conditions, HIFα proteins are very unstable due to hydroxylation by a recently described family of proline hydroxylases termed EGL-Nine homologs (EGLN). Upon hydroxylation, HIFα is recognized by the product of the tumor suppressor vhl and targeted for proteosomal degradation. Since EGLNs require oxygen to catalize HIF hydroxylation, this reaction does not efficiently occur under low oxygen tension. Thus, under hypoxia, HIFα escapes from degradation and transcribes target genes. The mRNA levels of two of the three EGLNs described to date are induced by hypoxia, suggesting that they might be novel HIF target genes; however, no proof for this hypothesis has been reported. Here we show that the induction of EGLN1 and -3 by hypoxia is found in a wide range of cell types. The basal levels of EGLN3 are always well below those of EGLN1 and EGLN2, and its induction by hypoxia is larger than that found for EGLN1. The inhibitor of transcription, actinomycin D, prevents the increase of EGLN3 mRNA induced by hypoxia, indicating that it is due to enhanced gene expression. Interestingly, EGLN1 and EGLN3 mRNAs were also triggered by EGLN inhibitors, suggesting the involvement of HIFα in the control of its transcription. In agreement with this possibility, pVHL-deficient cell lines, which present high HIF activity under normoxia, also showed dramatically increased normoxic levels of EGLN3. Moreover, the overexpression of an oxygen-insensitive mutant form of HIFα resulted in increased normoxic levels of EGLN3 mRNA. Finally, hypoxic induction of EGLNs was not observed in cells lacking functional HIFα.

Mammalian cells are critically dependent on oxygen for survival; thus, it is not surprising that an evolutionarily conserved machinery able to sense oxygen levels is present in almost every cell type studied. The activity of a variety of signaling molecules has been found to be altered in response to changes in oxygen tension, including ion channels (1.Conforti L. Millhorn D.E. J. Physiol.

Among them, the most common and best understood response is the activation of a group of basic helix-loop-helix-Per/Aryl hydrocarbon receptor translocator/Sim domain transcription factors, called hypoxiainducible factors (HIF) 1The abbreviations used are: HIFhypoxia inducible factor(s)VHLvon Hipple-LindauVEGFvascular endothelial growth factorEGLNEGL-Nine homologQ-RT-PCRquantitative real time PCRE3ubiquitin-protein isopeptide ligase.1The abbreviations used are: HIFhypoxia inducible factor(s)VHLvon Hipple-LindauVEGFvascular endothelial growth factorEGLNEGL-Nine homologQ-RT-PCRquantitative real time PCRE3ubiquitin-protein isopeptide ligase. (14.Wang G.L. Semenza G.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 21513-21518Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In fact, HIF is responsible for the induction of the vast majority of genes up-regulated in response to decreased oxygen tension. HIF transcription factors are heterodimers of a constitutively expressed β subunit (HIF-β; also known as the aryl hydrocarbon receptor translocator) and an oxygen-regulated α subunit (HIF-α). Although there are three types of α subunits, HIF-1α, HIF-2α (also known as the endothelial Per/Aryl hydrocarbon receptor translocator/Sim domain), and HIF-3α, encoded by different genes, it is currently accepted that they are regulated in a similar fashion by oxygen availability. The expression of HIFβ and α subunits genes, their mRNA stability, and the half-life of HIFβ protein are not influenced by oxygen levels. In contrast, HIFα proteins are extremely unstable in the presence of oxygen due to a high degradation rate by the proteasome, whereas their half-life is dramatically increased under hypoxia (15.Huang L.E. Arany Z. Livingston D.M. Bunn H.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 32253-32259Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1018) Google Scholar). The realization that tumoral cells deficient for the product of the tumor suppressor gene vhl overexpressed the HIF-regulated gene vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) (16.Iliopoulos O.

Cancer Res. 1996; 56: 2299-2301PubMed Google Scholar) led to the identification of pVHL as the substrate recognition component of an E3 ubiquitin ligase complex that targets HIFα for proteosomal degradation (18.Maxwell P.H. Wiesener M.S. Chang G.W. Clifford S.C. Vaux E.C. Cockman M.E. Wykoff C.C. Pugh C.W. Maher E.R. Ratcliffe P.J. Nature. 1999; 399: 271-275Crossref PubMed Scopus (4089) Google Scholar). It is noteworthy that pVHL binding to HIFα is dependent on hydroxylation of two specific proline residues on HIFα, a posttranslational modification that is only found under normal oxygen tension (19.Jaakkola P.

To date, four different genes have been reported to encode proteins with HIF proline hydroxylase activity; three of them are closely related to C. elegans egl-9 gene and thus have been termed EGL-Nine homologs 1, 2, and 3 (EGLN1 to -3). Due to the simultaneous independent cloning of EGLNs by different groups, they have been given other names including HIF proline hydroxylase-2, -3, and -1 and proline hydroxylase domain-2, -1, and -3, respectively; for simplicity, we will use the EGLN nomenclature. Little information is available regarding the fourth HIF proline hydroxylase, PH-4 (24.Oehme F. Ellinghaus P. Kolkhof P. Smith T.J. Ramakrishnan S. Hutter J. Schramm M. Flammea I. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2002; 296: 343-349Crossref PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar). Moreover, it has not yet been proved that PH-4 directly acts on HIFα. Since dioxygenases require oxygen to catalyze substrate hydroxylations, it has been proposed that EGLNs function as the oxygen sensors that directly regulate HIFα stability. In fact, calculation of the Km for oxygen of the EGLNs has revealed that it is high enough to support their role as oxygen sensors at the normal oxygen tension found in tissues (25.Hirsilä M.

Moreover, the increased mRNA levels correlate with increased EGLN activity (27.Naranjo-Suárez S. Castellanos M.C. Alvarez-Tejado M. Vara A. Landazuri M.O. del Peso L. J. Biol.

As a whole, these results suggest that EGLN1 and -3 can be targets of the pVHL/HIF pathway, but no evidence for this hypothesis has been reported. Herein we have further investigated this possibility and have found that hypoxic induction of EGLN3 requires an intact pVHL/HIF pathway and that HIF activation is sufficient to induce EGLN3 gene transcription. Cell Culture and Reagents—The pVHL-deficient 786-O cell clones stably expressing wild type VHL (WT10), truncated VHL (1–115) or empty plasmid (PRC3) were kindly provided by Dr. Kaelin (Dana-Farber Institute, Boston, MA). Parental VHL-negative RCC4 cells (herein designated RCC4–) and the corresponding VHL-stable transfectants (RCC4+) were provided by Dr. Maxwell (Imperial College, London, UK). Parental VHL-negative RCC10 cells and a clone derived by stable transfection of VHL (VHL53) were provided by Dr. Plate (JWG University, Frankfurt, Germany). Parental VHL-defective UM-RC6 cells and the stable VHL transfectant, UM-RC6 3-4 (herein referred to as 3-4), were provided by Dr. Lerman and Dr. Ivanov (Laboratory of Immunobiology, NCI, National Institutes of Health, Frederick, MD). WT8-PP13 clone derives from WT8 cells upon stable expression of a P402A, P564G mutant HIF-1α. All cells were maintained in RPMI 1640 medium with GLUTAMAX-I (Invitrogen). For WT-10, 1–115, PRC3, WT-10-PP13, VHL+53, and RCC4+, G418 sulfate 100 mg/ml (Promega) was added to culture medium. Hepa1 and HepaC4 cells were maintained in α-modifed Eagle's medium (Biochrom) and 4.5/Ka13 cells in Ham's nutrient mixture F-12 (Euroclone). In all cases, culture medium was supplemented with 100 units/ml penicillin and 100 μg/ml streptomycin and 10% fetal bovine serum. Human umbilical vein endothelial primary cells were isolated and grown as previously described (29.Munoz C. Castellanos M.C. Alfranca A. Vara A. Esteban M.A. Redondo J.M. de L azuri M.O. J.

Deferoxamine was purchased from Sigma; anti-HIF-1α was from Transduction Laboratories; anti-HIF-2α/endothelial Per/aryl hydrocarbon receptor translocator/Sim domain was from Novus Biologicals (Littleton CO); and anti-αTubulin was from Sigma. Western Blot—Immediately after treatments, cells were washed with ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline and harvested in 70–200 μl of 1× loading buffer. Lysates were sonicated for 4 s, centrifuged at 4 °C for 2 min at 14,000 × g, and resolved on 8–10% SDS-polyacrylamide gels. Proteins were then transferred to nitrocellulose membranes (Bio-Rad), blocked with 5% nonfat dry milk in TBS-T (50 mm Tris, pH 7.6, 150 mm ClNa, 0.1% Tween 20), and incubated overnight at 4 °C with the indicated antibodies. Immunolabeling was detected by enhanced chemiluminiscence (Amersham Biosciences) and visualized with a digital luminescent image analyzer (FUJIFILM LAS-1000 CH). Quantitative RT-PCR—Immediately after treatments, cells were harvested into 1 ml of Ultraspec reagent (Biotecx; Houston, TX). Total RNA was extracted and quantified, and integrity was tested by gel electrophoresis. 1 μg of total RNA from each sample was retrotranscripted to cDNA (Improm-II reverse transcriptase; Promega). 1–3 μl of cDNA samples were used as template for amplification reactions carried out with the LC Fast Start DNA master SYBR Green I kit (Roche Applied Science) following the manufacturer's instructions. PCR amplifications were carried out in a Light Cycler System (Roche Applied Science), and data were analyzed with LightCycler software 3 version 3.5.28 (Idaho Technology Inc.). For analysis purposes, the amplicon for each of the analyzed genes was cloned, and known amounts of the cloned product were used to generate a standard curve. The number of copies of the gene of interest in each sample was extrapolated from the corresponding standard curve by the indicated software.

Hypoxia Increases EGLN1 and EGLN3 mRNA Levels by Up-regulation of Their Gene Expression—It has been reported that hypoxia up-regulates EGLN1 and -3, but not EGLN2, mRNA in several cell types including HeLa cells (22.Epstein A.C.

Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2003; 303: 947-953Crossref PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar). In addition to these cell lines, we have found that EGLN1 is up-regulated in HEK293, HepG2, and Jurkat cells and EGLN3 in HepG2 and Jurkat cells (Fig. 1A). In contrast, we found no consistent EGLN2 induction by hypoxia in any of these cell lines, despite the fact that VEGF, a well known HIF target gene, was up-regulated in all of them (Fig. 1A). Large differences were observed in the basal levels of each EGLN among the distinct cell lines and when comparing the quantity of each EGLN within each cell line (Fig. 1B). EGLN3 mRNA levels were far below that of EGLN1 and -2 in all of the cases (Fig. 1B). Next we asked whether the induction of EGLN mRNA levels was due to increased gene expression. To address this question, HeLa cells were exposed to hypoxia in the presence or absence of the transcription inhibitor actinomycin D, and the mRNA levels of EGLN1, EGLN3, and VEGF determined by quantitative real time PCR (Q-RT-PCR). As shown in Fig. 1C, the induction of EGLN1, EGLN3, and VEGF by hypoxia was completely blocked by actinomycin D treatment, whereas HIF-1α protein induction was unaffected, suggesting that their induction requires gene transcription. The inhibition of EGLN activity mimics hypoxic conditions leading to HIF stabilization and induction of HIF-target genes (30.Warnecke C. Griethe W. Weidemann A. Jürgensen J.S. Willam C. Bachmann S. Ivashchenko Y. Wagner I. Frei U. Wiesener M. Eckardt K.-U. FASEB J. 2003; 17: 1186-1188Crossref PubMed Scopus (185) Google Scholar). Since hypoxia induces EGLN1 and -3 gene expression, we next asked whether this induction could be mimicked by interference with the activity of the EGLNs, as demonstrated previously for other genes regulated by the HIF pathway (30.Warnecke C. Griethe W. Weidemann A. Jürgensen J.S. Willam C. Bachmann S. Ivashchenko Y. Wagner I. Frei U. Wiesener M. Eckardt K.-U. FASEB J. 2003; 17: 1186-1188Crossref PubMed Scopus (185) Google Scholar). To this end, HeLa cells were exposed to hypoxia or treated, under normoxia, with deferoxamine or the 2-oxoglutarate competitive inhibitor, deoxymethylglutarate (19.Jaakkola P. Mole D.R. Tian Y.M. Wilson M.I. Gielbert J. Gaskell S.J. Kriegsheim A. Hebestreit H.F. Mukherji M. Schofield C.J. Maxwell P.H. Pugh C.W. Ratcliffe P.J. Science. 2001; 292: 468-472Crossref PubMed Scopus (4393) Google Scholar). The hydroxylation reaction catalyzed by EGLNs requires iron, and it is coupled to 2-oxoglutarate decarboxylation; thus, both iron chelants and oxoglutarate analogs inhibit EGLN activity and result in HIF activation (19.Jaakkola P. Mole D.R. Tian Y.M. Wilson M.I. Gielbert J. Gaskell S.J. Kriegsheim A. Hebestreit H.F. Mukherji M. Schofield C.J. Maxwell P.H. Pugh C.W. Ratcliffe P.J. Science. 2001; 292: 468-472Crossref PubMed Scopus (4393) Google Scholar). As shown in Fig. 1D, deferoxamine treatment resulted in the induction of EGLN1 and -3 mRNAs up to a level similar to that observed under hypoxia. Similarly, deoxymethylglutarate treatment up-regulated both EGLN mRNAs even more potently than hypoxia or deferoxamine treatments. As a control, VEGF level was monitored and, as shown in Fig. 1D, there was a good correlation between the induction of EGLNs and VEGF mRNAs. Thus, EGLN1 and, more prominently, EGLN3 mRNAs are commonly induced by hypoxia through a mechanism involving its gene expression. Importantly, hypoxic induction of EGLN1 and -3 mRNAs can be mimicked by inhibition of EGLN activity, suggesting that it could be mediated by the EGLN/pVHL/HIF pathway. EGLN3 mRNA Is Up-regulated in pVHL-deficient Cells—It has been previously shown that HIF target genes, such as VEGF, are up-regulated under normoxic conditions in pVHL-deficient tumor cells (16.Iliopoulos O. Levy A.P. Jiang C. Kaelin W.G.J. Goldberg M.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 10595-10599Crossref PubMed Scopus (741) Google Scholar, 17.Siemeister G. Weindel K. Mohrs K. Barleon B. Martiny-Baron G. Marme D. Cancer Res. 1996; 56: 2299-2301PubMed Google Scholar) as a consequence of constitutive stabilization of HIFα in these cells (18.Maxwell P.H. Wiesener M.S. Chang G.W. Clifford S.C. Vaux E.C. Cockman M.E. Wykoff C.C. Pugh C.W. Maher E.R. Ratcliffe P.J. Nature. 1999; 399: 271-275Crossref PubMed Scopus (4089) Google Scholar). In order to determine the involvement of the EGLN/pVHL/HIF pathway on the hypoxia-induced expression of EGLN1 and EGLN3 genes, we decided to investigate whether the expression of these genes was up-regulated in pVHL-deficient cell lines. To this end, the mRNA levels of the different EGLNs were determined by Q-RT-PCR in cell lines derived from vhl-negative tumors. As a reference, the level of expression of each gene in the pVHL-deficient cell lines was always compared with the expression of that gene in cell lines forced to express normal pVHL by stable transfection of the wild type full-length vhl cDNA. As shown in Fig. 2A, the level of EGLN3 mRNA was dramatically increased in the vhl-negative 786-O cells, as compared with 786-O cells expressing exogenous wild type pVHL. The same result was obtained for VEGF, as previously reported (16.Iliopoulos O. Levy A.P. Jiang C. Kaelin W.G.J. Goldberg M.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 10595-10599Crossref PubMed Scopus (741) Google Scholar, 17.Siemeister G. Weindel K. Mohrs K. Barleon B. Martiny-Baron G. Marme D. Cancer Res. 1996; 56: 2299-2301PubMed Google Scholar). In contrast to EGLN3 and VEGF, the mRNA levels of EGLN1 and -2 were similar in cells with or without functional pVHL (Fig. 2A). In order to confirm these results, we determined the level of EGLN3 mRNA in three additional pVHL-deficient cell lines obtained independently by different groups from human renal clear cell carcinomas. As in the case of the 786-O vhl-negative tumors (Fig. 2A), the level of EGLN3 was dramatically increased in the parental cell line (or mock-transfected) as compared with their pVHL expressing derivates (Fig. 2B). Interestingly, EGLN3 was also increased in vhl-negative 786-O cells stably expressing a truncated, inactive, version of pVHL (Fig. 2B, asterisk). Importantly, restoration of pVHL function in vhl-deficient cell lines not only reduced basal normoxic levels of EGLN3 mRNA but also conferred the hypoxic inducibility (Fig. 2C) that was lost in the pVHL-deficient cells. 2M. C. Castellanos and L. del Peso, unpublished observations. Thus, loss of VHL function results in deregulated EGLN3 expression but not EGLN1 or EGLN2 expression. Constitutive Activation of HIFα Is Sufficient to Induce EGLN3 mRNA—The best characterized consequence of pVHL loss is the activation of HIF; hence, the results presented above suggest that the up-regulation of EGLN3 found in vhl-deficient cells was due to HIFα activation. However, alterations associated with pVHL loss, other than HIFα stabilization, could also be the cause of the increased expression of EGLN3. To further explore these possibilities, we investigated the effect of forced expression of a pVHL-resistant mutant form of HIFα into 786-O cells stably expressing pVHL (WT-8 cell line). To this end, we stably transfected the WT-8 cell line with a cDNA encoding for a HIFα protein in which the prolines 402 and 564, which are hydroxylated under normoxia and required for pVHL binding (19.Jaakkola P. Mole D.R. Tian Y.M. Wilson M.I. Gielbert J. Gaskell S.J. Kriegsheim A. Hebestreit H.F. Mukherji M. Schofield C.J. Maxwell P.H. Pugh C.W. Ratcliffe P.J. Science. 2001; 292: 468-472Crossref PubMed Scopus (4393) Google Scholar, 20.Ivan M. Kondo K. Yang H. Kim W. Valiando J. Ohh M. Salic A. Asara J.M. Lane W.S. Kaelin Jr., W.G. Science. 2001; 292: 464-468Crossref PubMed Scopus (3844) Google Scholar), were changed to alanine and glycine residues, respectively. The resulting cell line was designated PP13. 786-O cells do not express detectable amounts of HIF-1α, but they do express HIF-2α that is stabilized under hypoxic conditions (Fig. 3A). In the PP13 cell line, endogenous HIF-2α showed oxygen dependence, whereas exogenous mutant HIF-1α protein was expressed constitutively regardless of the oxygen tension (Fig. 3A). As a consequence of the constitutive expression of HIF1α in the PP13 cell line, the basal level of VEGF mRNA is modestly, but reproducibly, incremented as compared with its expression in the WT8 cells, and a reporter construct encoding the luciferase gene under the control of hypoxia response element elements is activated. 2M. C. Castellanos and L. del Peso, unpublished observations. Therefore, the PP13 cell line presents a constitutive active HIF pathway. Importantly, the basal level of EGLN3 was increased in PP13, as compared with WT-8, up to the level obtained in WT-8 cells after 8 h under hypoxia (Fig. 3B). Moreover, under hypoxia, the level of EGLN3 found in PP13 was higher than that observed in WT8 cells, probably due to cooperation of HIF1α P402A/P564G with endogenous endothelial Per/aryl hydrocarbon receptor translocator/Sim domain (HIF-2α) protein (Fig. 3B). In contrast to EGLN3, no significant increase of EGLN1 or EGLN2 was found in cells expressing active HIF (Fig. 3C). These data indicate that HIFα activation is sufficient to induce EGLN3, although they do not rule out that for maximal induction, other factors may be required. HIFα Is Necessary for the Hypoxic Induction of EGLN1 and EGLN3—The data presented so far indicate that activation of HIFα induced by hypoxia or pVHL deficiency result in increased EGLN3 mRNA level. We then wanted to determine whether HIFα was necessary for EGLN induction by hypoxia. In order to address this question, we studied EGLN3 induction in cell lines with well defined deficiencies in the activation of HIF, such as HepaC4 and Ka13 cell lines. HepaC4 cells do not express a functional HIFβ subunit, and as a consequence, HIFα protein is not able to transactivate target genes, in contrast to the parental Hepa1 cells (31.Wood S.M. Gleadle J.M. Pugh C.W. Hankinson O. Ratcliffe P.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 15117-15123Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (258) Google Scholar). On the other hand, the Ka13 cell line lacks HIF-1α and HIF-2α expression, since they were selected from the 4.5 Chinese hamster ovary cell line that did not express HIF-2α after a mutagenesis protocol aimed to eliminate HIF-1α (32.Wood S.M. Wiesener M.S. Yeates K.M. Okada N. Pugh C.W. Maxwell P.H. Ratcliffe P.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 8360-8368Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (169) Google Scholar). As shown in Fig. 4A, Hepa1 cells up-regulated EGLN3, EGLN1, and VEGF mRNAs upon exposure to low oxygen tension. In contrast, no change was observed in the levels of any of these mRNAs in the HIFβ-deficient HepaC4 cells (Fig. 4A). Similar results were observed in the Ka13 cells; whereas EGLN3 and VEGF were induced by hypoxia in the parental 4.5 cells, no increase was found in the Ka13 cells lacking HIFα proteins (Fig. 4B). In the case of the Ka13 cells, both EGLN3 and VEGF normoxic levels were higher than those observed in the HIF-1α-expressing 4.5 cells,2 suggesting that other factors than HIF regulate the expression of these genes. Thus, similar to other hypoxia-regulated genes, such as VEGF, the activity of HIF is necessary for the induction of EGLN-3 and EGLN-1 by low oxygen tension. The results above indicate first that EGLN1 and -3 are induced by hypoxia and hypoxia-mimetic agents, through a transcription-dependent mechanism; second that EGLN3, but not EGLN1, is up-regulated in pVHL-deficient cells and cells overexpressing a constitutively active form of HIF-1α; and finally that the activity of HIF is necessary for EGLN1 and EGLN3 induction by hypoxia. Hence, altogether the data presented herein strongly indicate that EGLN1 and -3 genes are induced by hypoxia through the EGLN/VHL/HIF pathway. In agreement, we have identified HIF binding sites followed by HIF ancillary sequences (33.Kimura H. Weisz A. Ogura T. Hitomi Y. Kurashima Y. Hashimoto K. D'Acquisto F. Makuuchi M. Esumi H. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 2292-2298Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (229) Google Scholar) on EGLN1 and EGLN3 promoters, whereas such sequences are missing in the 5-kb sequence upstream from the transcriptional start of the EGLN2 gene. Further work is required to determine whether these sequences are functional hypoxia response elements. Since EGLNs are components of the HIF pathway, our results suggest a regulatory feedback loop in this signaling route. The increase on EGLN activity during hypoxia might be required to ensure fast elimination of HIF after reoxygenation. In fact, it has been shown that HIFα down-regulation upon reoxygenation occurs faster after long periods of hypoxia (34.Berra E. Richard D.E. Gothie E. Pouyssegur J. FEBS Lett. 2001; 491: 85-90Crossref PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar). Alternatively, the increase of the total amount of enzyme (EGLN) during hypoxia might alter the kinetics of the reaction, leading to changes in the reaction equilibrium after extended periods of time under hypoxia. As a consequence, at least under moderate hypoxia, EGLN induction should result in augmented HIFα degradation and lead to a reduction of steady state levels of HIFα. Accordingly, we have found that in PC12 cells exposed to 1% oxygen, the amount of HIF2α is higher 3 h after hypoxic challenge than after 8 h.2 On the other hand, it is important to note that the basal (normoxic) levels of EGLN3 are extremely low in all cases studied; thus, in the case of EGLN3, hypoxia induces a qualitative change in the cellular EGLN composition more than just a change in the amount of preexisting enzymes. Some reports have already demonstrated that not all three EGLNs have the same affinity for HIFα (25.Hirsilä M. Koivunen P. Günzler V. Kivirikko K.I. Myllyharju J. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 30772-30780Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (648) Google Scholar, 35.Huang J. Zhao Q. Mooney S.M. Lee F.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 39792-39800Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (246) Google Scholar), and each individual EGLN has different activity toward the two target prolines on HIFα (22.Epstein A.C. Gleadle J.M. McNeill L.A. Hewitson K.S. O'Rourke J. Mole D.R. Mukherji M. Metzen E. Wilson M.I. Dhanda A. Tian Y.M. Masson N. Hamilton D.L. Jaakkola P. Barstead R. Hodgkin J. Maxwell P.H. Pugh C.W.

Chem. 2003; 278: 30772-30780Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (648) Google Scholar); thus, changes on the cellular EGLN composition may translate into a differential induction of the distinct HIFα proteins or change the kinetics of response to oxygen availability. Interestingly, whereas EGLN3 mRNA level in VHL-deficient cells was dramatically increased as compared with cells with restored VHL function, the amount of EGLN1 was not increased. This result could indicate that, in contrast to EGLN3, HIF stabilization is not sufficient to induce EGLN1 gene expression, and other, hypoxia-induced VHL-independent, factors are required. In fact, the experiments with the mutant form of HIF-1α showed a poor induction of ELGN-3, as compared with the pVHL-deficient cells, suggesting that even EGLN3 may require other factors than HIF for a robust gene induction by hypoxia. In this sense, it was reported that hypoxic induction of VEGF is enhanced by the cooperation between HIF and activator protein-1 transcription factor (36.Damert A. Ikeda E. Risau W. Biochem. J. 1997; 327: 419-423Crossref PubMed Scopus (183) Google Scholar). Moreover, the rat homologue of EGLN3, sm-20, was firstly identified as an early gene induced by mitogens (37.Wax S.D. Rosenfield C.L. Taubman M.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 13041-13047Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In smooth muscle cells, sm-20 induction by mitogens can be mimicked by cAMP analogs, suggesting the involvement of the cAMP-response element-binding transcription factors on EGLN3 induction. Thus, although HIF is required for the hypoxic induction of EGLN1 and EGLN3, other factors than HIF will probably modulate EGLN gene expression. We thank S.

Further, we found that polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs) enhanced αS oligomerization in intact mesencephalic neuronal cells.

Higher PUFA levels were also detected in the supernatants and high-speed membrane fractions of neuronal cells over-expressing wild-type or PD-causing mutant αS. This increased PUFA content in the membrane fraction was accompanied by increased membrane fluidity in the αS overexpressing neurons. In accord, membrane fluidity and the levels of certain PUFAs were decreased in the brains of mice genetically deleted of αS. Together with our earlier observations, these results suggest that αS-PUFA interactions help regulate neuronal PUFA levels as well as the oligomerization state of αS, both normally and in human synucleinopathies. α-Synuclein (αS) is an abundant neuronal protein that accumulates in insoluble inclusions in Parkinson's disease (PD) and the related disorder, dementia with Lewy bodies (DLB).

Further, we observed a pool of soluble αS oligomers that is detectable only after biochemical treatments that remove fatty acids and other lipids (16.Sharon R. Bar-Joseph I. Frosch M.P. Walsh D.M.

These highly soluble, lipid-associated oligomers were detected in mesencephalic neuronal (MES) cells expressing human αS, in the brains of normal and human αS transgenic mice, and in the brains of humans with PD and the related disorder, dementia with Lewy bodies (DLB). We also showed that the formation of soluble αS oligomers is directly regulated by fatty acids in intact cells, with specific enhancement of the oligomers by PUFAs and inhibition by saturated FAs (16.Sharon R.

These findings have now led us to search systematically for evidence of a correlation between αS oligomerization and endogenous PUFA composition. First, we find that the relative amounts of PUFAs in the oligomer-rich soluble fraction of human brains with PD and DLB are higher than in those of age-matched normal brains. Second, higher PUFA levels are detected in the cytosols of normal mouse than αS-null mouse brain and in the cytosols of MES cells stably expressing human αS than in parental non-transfected cells. Third, the cytosolic PUFA accumulation in the human αS-transfected MES cells is accompanied by PUFA enrichment in membrane fractions containing synaptic vesicles. Fourth, we document higher membrane fluidity in membranes of αS-expressing MES cells than in the non-transfected cells and in the membranes of normal than αS-null mouse brains. αS-null Mice—An αS-targeted knock-out mouse line (αS–/–) in the C57Bl6 genetic background was purchased from Harlan Laboratories (Indianapolis, IN). Control C57Bl6 mice were obtained from Taconic Laboratories (Germantown, NY). Mice were bred routinely. To reduce experimental variability, we only used brains of mice that were born and raised in our animal facility rather than the founder mice that had been subjected to different husbandry. Human Brains—We utilized 5 of the 7 brains in the PD, DLB, and control groups that we had studied in an earlier work (16.Sharon R. Bar-Joseph I. Frosch M.P. Walsh D.M. Hamilton J.A. Selkoe D.J. Neuron. 2003; 37: 583-595Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (475) Google Scholar) and added 2 more neuropathologicallly confirmed brains to each of these 3 diagnostic groups (total n = 7 in each group). Neuropathological diagnoses and specimen handling were as previously described (16.Sharon R. Bar-Joseph I. Frosch M.P. Walsh D.M. Hamilton J.A. Selkoe D.J. Neuron. 2003; 37: 583-595Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (475) Google Scholar). Brain and Cellular Fractionation Protocol—Biochemical fractionation was carried out as previously described (17.Sharon R. Goldberg M.S. Bar-Josef I. Betensky R.A. Shen J. Selkoe D.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 9110-9115Crossref PubMed Scopus (266) Google Scholar). Briefly, high-speed (post-370,000 × g) cytosols and corresponding high-speed membrane pellets (membranes sedimenting between 10,000 and 370,000 × g) were collected. The membrane pellets were washed once and re-suspended in HEPES/MgCl2 buffer containing 0.32 m sucrose. No detergents were added to the membrane fraction. Quantitative FA Analysis—Samples of high-speed cytosols or membranes (1–1.5 mg protein) were processed and analyzed for FAs using the Microbial Identification System at Microbial ID, Inc. (Newark, DE). The standard protocol begins with sample lyophilization and resuspension in methanol. The sample is then subjected to the following steps: saponification with sodium hydroxide (3.75 m); methylation with 3.25 m HCl in 46% methyl alcohol (incubation at 80 °C for 10 min); extraction in 50% hexene/50% methyl tert-butyl ether; and a basic wash with 0.25 m NaOH. The organic phase containing fatty acids is injected into a Hewlett-Packard 5890A gas chromatograph (GC) equipped with a hydrogen flame ionization detector, an automatic injector, a sample controller, and an electronic integrator controlled by a minicomputer. The GC used a fused silica capillary column with methylphenyl silicone (SE54) as the stationary phase. The computer-controlled operating parameters of the instrument were as follows: injector temperature, 250°; detector temperature, 300°; oven temperature, programmed from 170° to 270° at 5° per min. The FA methyl esters in each sample were identified by comparing retention times with known standards and by computer calculation of equivalent chain lengths. Size Exclusion Chromatography (SEC)—SEC was performed on various high-speed cytosols, and the resultant fractions were collected and analyzed as described previously (16.Sharon R. Bar-Joseph I. Frosch M.P. Walsh D.M. Hamilton J.A. Selkoe D.J. Neuron. 2003; 37: 583-595Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (475) Google Scholar). Gas Chromatographic Mass Spectrometry (GC/MS)—Following solid-phase extraction (18.Gronert K. Martinsson-Niskanen T. Ravasi S. Chiang N. Serhan C.N. Am. J. Pathol. 2001; 158: 3-9Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (163) Google Scholar), samples were treated with diazomethane (20–30 min at 22 °C) followed by incubation with BSTFA (N,O-bis[trimethylsilyl]trifluoroacetamide) for ∼8–12 h at room temperature in the dark. Analyses were performed on a Hewlett-Packard 6890 gas chromatograph using a mass selective detector (HP 5973) equipped with an MS Chemstation. The instrument was set to acquire and store data at 1.6 scans per second. The column was a HP Ultra (25 mm × 0.2 mm × 0.22 μm), and all injections were made in the splitless mode with materials suspended in BSTFA (∼2 μl per injection). The GC temperature program was initiated at 150 °C and reached 250 °C at 10 min and 325 °C at 20 min in a gradient fashion. Fatty acids (saturated and unsaturated) were identified according to the prominent ions present in their individual mass spectra and their retention times (see “Results”). Membrane Fluidity Measurements—Samples of high-speed membranes (i.e membranes that sedimented between 10,000 and 370,000 × g) were kept at 4 °C without freeze and thaw and used within 2–3 days from preparation. Membrane fluidity was determined using pyrene decanoic acid (PDA), a fluorescent lipid reagent (Molecular Gene Technologies, product number 0271, Eugene, OR). Fluorescence was recorded using a 1420 Victor2 flourometer (PerkinElmer Life Sciences), and the assays were performed according to the manufacturer's recommendations, with some modifications. Samples were excited at 330 nm with an 80 nm bandwidth. The pyrene monomer emission intensity was measured at 400 nm with 10 nm slits, and the pyrene eximer emission intensity was measured using a cut-off filter at 460 nm. Samples (100 μm protein) were incubated with 20 μm PDA in perfusion buffer (100 nm NaCl, 5 mm HEPES, pH 7.4, 2 mm MgCl2, 5 mm KCl, 2 mm CaCl2, 5 mm glucose, and 50 mm mannitol) in a final volume of 200 μl. Incubation was carried out at 30 °C for 45 min with rotation. The membranes were spun down and washed twice in perfusion buffer, then re-suspended in fresh buffer and transferred to 96-well plates. Blank values of membrane samples with no pyrene probe were subtracted, and the ratios of eximer (460 nm) to monomer (400 nm) signals were calculated. Values represent means ± S.E. For measurements in mouse brains, seven different experiments each consisted of different brain membrane preparations with each preparation comprising 2–3 brains. For measurements in cells, 6 different experiments each consisted of different highspeed membrane pellets. Statistical Analyses—For individual FAs, we used exact Wilcoxon Rank Sum tests to compare the PD and DLB groups versus the control group of human brains, and the wt and A53T αS-transfected MES neuronal cells versus untransfected parental MES cells. We adjusted for multiple comparisons among fatty acid subgroups (i.e. saturated, monounsaturated, and polyunsaturated) using Bonferroni corrections. For the comparison of the FA subgroups (SFA, MUFA, and PUFA), exact Kruskal-Wallis tests were used to compare the levels of these summed fatty acids between diagnostic groups of subjects. As the total of the 3 types of fatty acids sum to 100% within each experiment, these three tests are dependent, and a Bonferroni-adjusted significance level of 0.05/3 = 0.017 was therefore used. We previously reported that αS can bind FAs in vitro (17.Sharon R. Goldberg M.S. Bar-Josef I. Betensky R.A. Shen J. Selkoe D.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 9110-9115Crossref PubMed Scopus (266) Google Scholar), that PUFAs promote whereas saturated FAs retard the formation of soluble αS oligomers both in vitro and in intact cells (16.Sharon R. Bar-Joseph I. Frosch M.P. Walsh D.M. Hamilton J.A. Selkoe D.J. Neuron. 2003; 37: 583-595Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (475) Google Scholar), and that the levels of soluble and insoluble αS oligomers are elevated in the brains of humans undergoing progressive αS accumulation, i.e. in PD and DLB (16.Sharon R. Bar-Joseph I. Frosch M.P. Walsh D.M. Hamilton J.A. Selkoe D.J. Neuron. 2003; 37: 583-595Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (475) Google Scholar). These findings led us to hypothesize that the increased levels of soluble αS oligomers in PD and DLB brains could be associated with changes in the composition of endogenous brain FAs. We further postulated that overexpressing αS in dopaminergic neuronal cells could alter their endogenous FA composition. Altered FA Composition of the High-speed Soluble Fractions of PD and DLB Brains—We assayed the FA composition of the very high-speed (post-370,000 × g) cytosols prepared from 7 brains each of the 3 diagnostic groups, PD, DLB, and age-matched controls. Five cases in each group had been previously tested for their levels of soluble αS oligomers, and these levels were invariably increased in the post-370,000 × g supernatants of the PD and DLB brains (16.Sharon R. Bar-Joseph I. Frosch M.P. Walsh D.M. Hamilton J.A. Selkoe D.J. Neuron. 2003; 37: 583-595Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (475) Google Scholar). SFAs, MUFAs, and PUFAs were quantified by GC in the high-speed soluble fractions of frontal cortex (Fig. 1, a–c). We observed a highly consistent alteration in cortical PUFA composition in the PD and DLB brains: a decrease in linolenic acid (18:2) levels (with Bonferroni-adjusted p values of p = 0.055 for PD, p = 0.01 for DLB), an increase in docosahexaenoic acid (22:6) levels (adjusted p values of p = 0.003 for PD, p = 0.009 for DLB) and an increase in docosatetraenoic acid (22:4) levels for PD (p = 0.026) (the increase in 22:4 in DLB did not reach statistical significance (p = 0.129)). Other PUFAs (arachidonic acid, 20:4; eicosatrienoic acid, 20:3) were not significantly changed. Importantly, no significant alterations were seen in the compositional profiles of MUFAs and SFAs in these same brain supernatants. These results demonstrate an association between PUFA accumulation in the soluble fractions of PD and DLB brains (Fig. 1c) and the accumulation of highly soluble αS oligomers documented in these same fractions (16.Sharon R. Bar-Joseph I. Frosch M.P. Walsh D.M. Hamilton J.A. Selkoe D.J. Neuron. 2003; 37: 583-595Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (475) Google Scholar). Expression of Human αS in Dopaminergic Neurons Increases Endogenous PUFA Levels in Both Cytosolic and Membrane Fractions—Because increased αS oligomer levels were associated with increased PUFA levels in the soluble fractions of PD and DLB brains, we asked whether αS overexpression could itself induce alterations of PUFA composition. High-speed cytosols and membrane pellets were prepared from MES dopaminergic neuronal cells that were either untransfected or stably transfected with wt or A53T human αS. Quantitative analyses of FA composition were carried out at the peak stage of αS oligomer accumulation in these cells, i.e. between 85 and 130 days post-DNA transfection (16.Sharon R. Bar-Joseph I. Frosch M.P. Walsh D.M. Hamilton J.A. Selkoe D.J. Neuron. 2003; 37: 583-595Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (475) Google Scholar) (Fig. 2, a–c). These GC analyses of SFAs, MUFAs, and PUFAs were conducted in parallel with Western blots that confirmed the presence of αS oligomers in the high-speed cytosols (Fig. 3). We observed a selective accumulation of PUFAs in the cytosols of the αS-overexpressing cells. In non-transfected, parental MES cells, several PUFAs were undetectable by our assay: 20:5, 22:4, 22:5, and 22:6 (Fig. 2c). However, upon αS overexpression, these long chain PUFAs accumulated to readily detectable levels. In contrast, the levels of individual saturated and monounsaturated FAs were not significantly altered in the same samples (Fig. 2, a and b).Fig. 3αS occurs in soluble oligomers in the cytosol of human wt- and A53T-αS-transfected MES cells. Samples of high-speed cytosols (25 μg) from cells at their peak stage of oligomer accumulation, i.e. between 85 and 130 days post DNA transfection (16.Sharon R. Bar-Joseph I. Frosch M.P. Walsh D.M.

Neuron. 2003; 37: 583-595Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (475) Google Scholar), we showed that treating αS-expressing MES neurons with medium supplemented with PUFAs induced αS oligomerization and aggregation. In view of the above results indicating an association between αS oligomer accumulation and cytosolic PUFA levels, we now asked whether PUFA molecules themselves are associated with the αS oligomerization, or rather whether a PUFA-derived metabolite or other hydrophobic molecule is responsible. We analyzed the high-speed cytosols of wt human αS-transfected (versus untransfected) MES neurons by GC/MS at the peak stage of oligomer accumulation. We found that MES cells conditioned in medium supplemented with α-linolenic acid (18:3) (Fig. 4) or docosahexaenoic acid (22:6, not shown) accumulated these specific PUFAs in their cytosols in the case of the αS-overexpressing neurons (Fig. 4a), but not in the parental MES neurons (not shown). In an extensive GC/MS screen for αS-associated alterations in other hydrophobic molecules, we identified only elevations in the cellular levels of those FAs that had been enriched in the conditioning medium of the neurons. This result suggests that enhancement of soluble αS levels in a living neuronal cell leads to specific intracellular sequestration of those fatty acids enriched in the extracellular milieu of the neuron. We previously utilized a centrifugal fractionation protocol to obtain high-speed membrane fractions (sedimenting between 10,000 and 370,000 × g) from mouse brains that were then analyzed by quantitative Western blotting for αS content. About 10% of total mouse brain αS was found in this high-speed membrane fraction (17.Sharon R. Goldberg M.S. Bar-Josef I. Betensky R.A. Shen J. Selkoe D.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 9110-9115Crossref PubMed Scopus (266) Google Scholar). We therefore performed GC analyses of PUFA composition in the high-speed membrane fractions of the MES cells. This revealed a striking accumulation of several PUFAs in the membranes of the wt and A53T αS-transfected MES neurons versus the parental untransfected cells (Fig. 5), in association with the large rise in soluble αS oligomers in the cytosols of the former lines (Fig. 3) (16.Sharon R. Bar-Joseph I. Frosch M.P. Walsh D.M. Hamilton J.A. Selkoe D.J. Neuron. 2003; 37: 583-595Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (475) Google Scholar). Specifically, we observed increases in the following: 18:2 (wt p = 0.005 and A53T p = 0.01, versus untransfected MES); 20:4 (wt p = 0.055 and A53T p = 0.055); and 20:3 (present in detectable amounts in both wt and A53T but undetectable in untransfected cells) (Fig. 5c). Interestingly, the levels of the MUFA, oleic acid (18:1), were significantly reduced in the wt and A53T overexpressing cells (p = 0.04 versus untransfected cells) (Fig. 5b). Other MUFAs detectable by our assay were unchanged, as were SFAs. In addition to this analysis of individual FAs, we compared the summed values of all FAs in a group (i.e. total SFAs, total MUFAs, and total PUFAs) across our 3 cell lines (untransfected MES, wt human αS MES, and A53T human αS MES). We observed significant ∼7–8% increases in total cytosolic PUFA content in both the wt and A53T αS expressing cells (Bonferroni-corrected p values of 0.008 and 0.016, respectively). This was accompanied by significant ∼10–12% decreases in total cytosolic MUFA content (Bonferroni-corrected p values of 0.008 and 0.016, respectively). There were no significant changes in SFA content. These results clearly indicate that the expression of human αS in mesencephalic neurons results in relative increases in PUFA relative levels at the expense of MUFA relative levels. No differences were detected in the total amount of FAs in transfected αS cells compared with the parental MES cells. αS Expression Increases Membrane Fluidity in Cultured Dopaminergic Cells—Membrane fluidity is controlled by the balance among SFAs, MUFAs, and PUFAs in cell membranes (19.Mostofsky D.I. Yehuda S. Salem N.J. Bendich A. Fatty Acids Physiological and Behavioral Functions. Humana Press, Totowa, New Jersey2001Crossref Google Scholar). Relative increases in the amounts of PUFAs lead to increases in membrane fluidity, whereas relative increases in SFAs decrease membrane fluidity (19.Mostofsky D.I. Yehuda S. Salem N.J. Bendich A. Fatty Acids Physiological and Behavioral Functions. Humana Press, Totowa, New Jersey2001Crossref Google Scholar, 20.Yehuda S. Rabinovitz S. Carasso R.L. Mostofsky D.I. Neurobiol.

In light of the consistent shift in PUFA composition we observed in the membranes of αS-transfected MES neurons and human synucleinopathy brains (see Figs. 1, 2, and 5) as well as the documented interaction of αS with vesicle membranes (17.Sharon R.

To address this hypothesis, high-speed membrane pellets were again prepared from untransfected and human αS-transfected MES cells cultured under identical basal conditions in conditioned medium containing 5% adult plus 5% fetal bovine serum. To analyze membrane fluidity, we used a pyrene probe and measured its eximer formation after excitation at 330 nm. We quantified the emissions at 400 nm (pyrene monomers) and 460 nm (pyrene eximers). The ratio of eximer to monomer emission values serves as an indicator of relative membrane fluidity (see “Materials and Methods”). Pyrene eximer/monomer ratios were significantly higher, increasing by 49 ± 4% (p = 0.002; n = 6 different measurements) in the membranes of the wt human αS-expressing MES cells versus those of the parental untransfected cells (Table I).Table IMembrane fluidity values for parental and αS-overexpressing MES cellsCell typeEximer/monomer ratio ± S.E.Relative fluidityStatistical significance%MES3.57 ± 0.31100Wt-αS-MES5.23 ± 0.39149 ± 4p = 0.002 Open table in a new tab Altered Cytosolic Fatty Acid Composition and Reduced Membrane Fluidity in αS-null Mouse Brain—To validate in vivo the apparent effects of αS content on PUFA composition and membrane fluidity, we analyzed a C57Bl6 mouse line genetically deleted of αS, in comparison to C57Bl6 control mice (Fig. 6a). High-speed cytosols of wild-type (+/+) and αS-deleted (–/–) brains were subjected to quantitative analyses of FA composition. In agreement with our results in human brains and MES neurons containing αS oligomers, we detected higher relative PUFA levels in the presence of monomeric and oligomeric αS (+/+ brains) than in their absence (–/–brains). Docosahexaenoic acid (22:6) and α-linolenic acid (18:3) were detected in the cytosols of αS +/+ but not in αS–/–brains, and therefore were significantly different between the two groups (Fig. 6b). Decreases in certain other PUFAs (20:3, 22:4, and 22:5) in the –/–mice did not reach statistical significance. To strengthen this correlation between the presence of αS and selective PUFA accumulation, we next conducted SEC on the high-speed cytosols of both wild-type and αS–/–mouse brains and analyzed the FA composition of those SEC fractions found to contain αS oligomers in the +/+ mice (fractions 22–26 combined, of 54 fractions collected) (see Fig 6c).

https://openalex.org/W2027603142,"USP7 or HAUSP is a ubiquitin-specific protease in human cells that regulates the turnover of p53 and is bound by at least two viral proteins, the ICP0 protein of herpes simplex type 1 and the EBNA1 protein of Epstein-Barr virus. We have overexpressed and purified USP7 and shown that the purified protein is monomeric and is active for cleaving both a linear ubiquitin substrate and conjugated ubiquitin on EBNA1. Using partial proteolysis of USP7 coupled with matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization time-of-flight mass spectrometry, we showed that USP7 comprises four structural domains; an N-terminal domain known to bind p53, a catalytic domain, and two C-terminal domains. By passing a mixture of USP7 domains over EBNA1 and ICP0 affinity columns, we showed that the N-terminal p53 binding domain was also responsible for the EBNA1 interaction, while the ICP0 binding domain mapped to a C-terminal domain between amino acids 599-801. Tryptophan fluorescence assays showed that an EBNA1 peptide mapping to residues 395-450 was sufficient to bind the USP7 N-terminal domain and did so with a dissociation constant of 0.9-2 microM, whereas p53 peptides spanning the USP7-binding region gave dissociation constants of 9-17 microM in the same assay. In keeping with these relative affinities, gel filtration analyses of the complexes showed that the EBNA1 peptide efficiently competed with the p53 peptide for USP7 binding, suggesting that EBNA1 could affect p53 function in vivo by competing for USP7."

Although several factors such as the matrix metalloproteinases and the integrins have been shown to be important for osteoclast recruitment, the mechanism of action remains poorly understood. In this study we investigated the molecular mechanisms homing osteoclasts to their future site of resorption during bone development. We show that RANKL and VEGF, two cytokines known to be present in bone, possess chemotactic properties toward osteoclasts cultured in modified Boyden chambers. Furthermore, in ex vivo cultures of embryonic murine metatarsals, a well established model of osteoclast recruitment, antagonists of RANKL and VEGF reduced calcium release, showing that both cytokines play roles during bone development. In cultures of purified osteoclasts both RANKL and VEGF induced phosphorylation of ERK1/2 MAP kinase. M-CSF, a well-known chemoattractant of osteoclast, also induced activation of ERK1/2, although this activation followed a kinetic pattern differing from that of RANKL and VEGF. RANKL and VEGF-induced, but not M-CSF-induced, osteoclast invasion was completely blocked by the specific inhibitor of ERK1/2 phosphorylation, PD98059. In addition, PD98059 was able to inhibit calcium release in cultures of embryonic metatarsals. In contrast, PD98059 was unable to abrogate the RANKL-induced calcium release in the tibia model, demonstrating that only some of the RANKL functions on osteoclast physiology are regulated through the ERK1/2 pathway. Taken together, these results show that RANKL and VEGF, in addition to their role in osteoclast differentiation and activation of resorption, are important components of the processes regulating osteoclast chemotaxis.

The development and continuous remodeling of the skeleton demand a tightly regulated balance between the bone-forming and bone-resorbing processes. Although many aspects of the resorptive processes remain elusive, there is general consensus that the hematopoietically derived osteoclast is the pivotal cell in the degradation of the bone matrix (reviewed in Ref. 1.Karsenty G. Genes Dev. 1999; 13: 3037-3051Crossref PubMed Scopus (273) Google Scholar). Inevitably, the focus centers on the factors that direct the resorptive activity of the osteoclasts and in particular the recruitment of the immature osteoclasts to the future site of resorption. Understanding the control of osteoclast recruitment to the future resorption site is of great importance, as incorrect regulation of recruitment it likely to constitute at least part of the underlying cause of the majority of bone metabolic disorders. During embryonic development of long bones, osteoclast precursors appear in the mesenchymal tissue surrounding the primitive bone collar. Along with endothelial cells they are recruited into the calcified tissue where they mature and begin formation of the marrow cavity (2.Blavier L. Delaisse J.M. J. Cell Sci. 1995; 108: 3649-3659PubMed Google Scholar). Cytokines are likely to constitute the molecular mediator through which the osteoclasts are directed to their future site of resorption.

Med. 1993; 178: 1733-1744Crossref PubMed Scopus (313) Google Scholar, 9.Owens J. Chambers T.J. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1993; 195: 1401-1407Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). In in vitro cultures, osteoclasts have been shown to migrate toward sources of M-CSF, marking the cytokine as one of the potential mediators of osteoclast recruitment. Other cytokines that are expressed in the immediate vicinity of the bone surface and whose receptors are present on the osteoclast include vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) and receptor activator of nuclear factor κB ligand (RANKL). VEGF has been shown to partially rescue M-CSF deficiency in the op/op mice (10.Niida S. Kaku M. Amano H. Yoshida H. Kataoka H. Nishikawa S. Tanne K. Maeda N. Nishikawa S. Kodama H. J. Exp. Med. 1999; 190: 293-298Crossref PubMed Scopus (361) Google Scholar). Furthermore, systemic injection of a soluble chimeric VEGF receptor (mFlt-1-IgG) induced morphological changes in the growth plate suggesting impaired chondroclast (a subset of osteoclasts present during bone development) function (11.Gerber H.P. Vu T.H. Ryan A.M. Kowalski J. Werb Z. Ferrara N. Nat. Med. 1999; 5: 623-628Crossref PubMed Scopus (1723) Google Scholar). Finally, we have previously mentioned an effect of VEGF on osteoclast migration (3.Engsig M.T. Chen Q.J. Vu T.H. Pedersen A.C. Therkidsen B. Lund L.R. Henriksen K. Lenhard T. Foged N.T. Werb Z. Delaisse J.M. J. Cell Biol. 2000; 151: 879-890Crossref PubMed Scopus (491) Google Scholar). Similarly, RANKL has been shown to have numerous effects on osteoclast physiology, including induction of differentiation, activation of resorption and stimulation of survival (12.Lacey D.L. Timms E.

RANKL, VEGF, and M-CSF all exert their functions through multiple signal transduction pathways, which have not yet been completely characterized. Especially, the pathways involving the mitogen-activated protein kinases (MAPK) have attracted considerable interest in recent years due to their central role in a range of osteoclastic activities. The p38 MAPK was shown to be essential for osteoclast differentiation in vitro (15.Matsumoto M. Sudo T. Saito T. Osada H. Tsujimoto M. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 31155-31161Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (475) Google Scholar, 16.Matsumoto M. Sudo T. Maruyama M. Osada H. Tsujimoto M. FEBS Lett. 2000; 486: 23-28Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). The extracellular signal-regulated kinases 1 and 2 (ERK1/2) are activated by M-CSF, the interleukins IL-1α and IL-1β and are likely involved in osteoclast survival (17.Miyazaki T. Katagiri H. Kanegae Y. Takayanagi H. Sawada Y. Yamamoto A. Pando M.P. Asano T. Verma I.M. Oda H. Nakamura K. Tanaka S. J. Cell Biol. 2000; 148: 333-342Crossref PubMed Scopus (343) Google Scholar, 18.Lee Z.H.

In addition, the ERK1/2 kinases have also been implicated in fibroblast growth factor-2 (FGF-2) and Gas6-induced resorption (19.Katagiri M. Hakeda Y. Chikazu D. Ogasawara T. Takato T. Kumegawa M.

Although, RANKL activation of ERK1/2 in mature osteoclasts has been demonstrated, the relevance of this activation has yet to be clarified (21.Wong B.R. Besser D. Kim N. Arron J.R. Vologodskaia M. Hanafusa H. Choi Y. Mol. Cell. 1999; 4: 1041-1049Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (522) Google Scholar). Here, we used a combination of ex vivo bone cultures and in vitro cell migration assays to study the role of RANKL and VEGF in osteoclast recruitment during bone development. We demonstrate that addition of antagonists of RANKL and VEGF, osteoprotegerin (OPG) and endostatin, respectively, led to reduced recruitment of osteoclasts in ex vivo cultures of embryonic bones. Moreover, both RANKL and VEGF dose-dependently induced osteoclast recruitment in the Boyden chamber invasion assay. We explored cytokine activation of the MAPKs in cultures of purified osteoclasts and found that RANKL and VEGF, as well as M-CSF, activated the ERK1/2, but failed to activate p38 MAPK. Further studies of the ERK1/2 kinases demonstrated that ERK1/2 is indeed involved in osteoclast recruitment in embryonic bones. Interestingly, we discovered that RANKL and VEGF utilize an ERK1/2-dependent pathway for inducing osteoclast migration; whereas M-CSF-mediated migration is independent of the ERK1/2 cascade. Finally, we demonstrate that RANKL-induced bone resorption is independent of ERK1/2 activity, further underlining the important differences in the signaling cascades employed by the various cytokines. Reagents and Mice—All animal experiments were performed according to approved protocols following guidelines at Nordic Bioscience A/S, Denmark. Recombinant murine RANKL, human VEGF, human M-CSF, and recombinant human Flt-Fc chimeric protein were from R&D Systems. Recombinant human OPG-Fc chimeric protein was from Alexis Corporation. Endostatin was purchased from Calbiochem. Antibodies toward ERK1/2, p38, phospho-ERK1/2, and phospho-p38 were provided by Cell Signaling Technology. The MAP kinase inhibitors PD98059 and SB203580 were from Calbiochem. Preparation of Osteoclast-like Cells and Spleen Cell-derived Osteoclasts—Osteoclast-like cells were generated in the co-culture system (22.Akatsu T. Tamura T. Takahashi N. Udagawa N. Tanaka S. Sasaki T. Yamaguchi A. Nagata N. Suda T. J. Bone Miner. Res. 1992; 7: 1297-1306Crossref PubMed Scopus (160) Google Scholar). Briefly, primary calvarial osteoblast were isolated by mincing calvariae from 1 day old BalbC CF1 mice and then culturing them in αMEM containing 10% fetal bovine serum. Hematopoietic cells were isolated by dissecting the femur and tibiae of 6-week-old BalbC CF1 mice, and subsequent coculturing (1.8 × 107) with the calvarial osteoblasts (2.5 × 105) and grown for 6–7 days in αMEM containing 10% fetal bovine serum and 10 nm 1,25α-dihydroxy-vitamin D3 (VitD3). Spleen cell-derived osteoclasts were generated as described (12.Lacey D.L. Timms E. Tan H.L. Kelley M.J. Dunstan C.R. Burgess T. Elliott R. Colombero A. Elliott G. Scully S. Hsu H. Sullivan J. Hawkins N. Davy E. Capparelli C. Eli A. Qian Y.X. Kaufman S. Sarosi I. Shalhoub V. Senaldi G. Guo J. Delaney J. Boyle W.J. Cell. 1998; 93: 165-176Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (4656) Google Scholar). Briefly, spleens were isolated from BalbC CF1 mice and mashed through a 70-μm filter (Invitrogen A/S). The cells were placed on a Ficoll-Hypaque gradient, centrifuged for 20 min. The cells at the interface were collected, washed in media, and grown for 6–7 days in αMEM +10% heat-inactivated fetal bovine serum in the presence of M-CSF (30 ng/ml) and RANKL (100 ng/ml). Chemotaxis Assays—Chemotaxis assays were modified from previous procedures (23.Sato T. Foged N.T. Delaisse J.M. J. Bone. Miner. Res. 1998; 13: 59-66Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). The assays were performed in modified Boyden chambers with polycarbonate filters containing 12-μm pore membranes (Corning Costar). The filters were coated with 10 μl of reconstituted type I collagen (Nitta Collagen) at a concentration of 2.4 mg/ml. Osteoclast-like cells (OCLs) were prepared from osteoclast/osteoblast co-cultures by sequential treatment with collagenase 0.1% (w/v) and dispase 0.1% (w/v) to remove osteoblastic cells. The remaining cells were loosened by trypsin treatment and then gently lifted off the plates with a rubber policeman. The OCLs were seeded in the culture inserts in αMEM containing 0,1% (w/v) albumax. The inserts were placed in 12-well plates, and the cells were cultured for 22 h with or without additions as described under “Results.” The cells were fixed in 3.7% formaldehyde, and OCLs were visualized TRAP staining using a leukocyte acid phosphatase kit (Sigma-Aldrich). In all assays where inhibitors were used, the OCLs were allowed to attach for 1 h before the addition of the inhibitor and cytokines to reduce any activity of the inhibitor on attachment of the cells. Invasion was determined as the ratio of OCLs that has invaded through the collagen gel to reach the lower side of the membrane compared with the total number of OCLs in the insert. Bone Resorption Models—Bone resorption was evaluated with well established models (2.Blavier L. Delaisse J.M. J. Cell Sci. 1995; 108: 3649-3659PubMed Google Scholar), on littermates. Timed pregnant mothers were injected subcutaneously with 100 μCi of 45CaCl2 (45Ca) at day 16 after the confirmation of the vaginal plug. The middle three metatarsals (preserved as a triad) and the tibiae were isolated from each hindlimb of day 17 embryos. One metatarsal triad or tibia from each embryo was used for treatments and the other as a control. The bone explants were cultured floating on Millipore filter membrane in 400 μl of BGJb medium supplemented with NaHCO3 (2.2 g/liter), NaCl (0.9 g/liter), albumax (1 g/liter), glutamax (0.5 g/liter), ascorbate (50 mg/liter), and (except for the experiment described in Fig. 7) VitD3 (50 nm) and the factors/inhibitors specified in the figure legends. The bones were cultured for 4 days, with measurement of 45Ca release every day. On day 4 the 45Ca remaining in the tissue was released by formic acid treatment and measured by scintillation counting. The demineralization of the bone explants was then expressed cumulatively as the percentage of total 45Ca amount. Immunoblotting—Spleen cell-derived osteoclasts were starved for 2 h in αMEM containing 0,1% (w/v) albumax to minimize the activation of kinases induced by the presence of serum and cytokines in the cultures. This was followed by incubation with the cytokines for various times as specified in the figure legends. After incubation with or without stimuli the spleen cell-derived osteoclasts were washed twice in ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline, followed by lysis in modified radioimmune precipitation assay buffer (30 mm NaCl, 50 mm Tris, 5 mm EDTA, 1% Nonidet P-40, 1% deoxycholic acid, 0,1% SDS, 5 mm NaF, 1 mm NaVO3, and protease inhibitor mixture from Calbiochem). Cell lysates were centrifuged for 30 min at 4 °C at 15,000 × g.10 μg of total protein were loaded and electrophoresed on 10% SDS-PAGE gels. The proteins were transferred to a nitrocellulose membrane (BA85; pore size: 0.45 μm from Schleicher & Schuell). The quality of the protein loading was confirmed by staining with 0.2% Ponceau S in trichloroacetic acid. Nonspecific binding was blocked by incubation of the membrane in TBS-T buffer (50 mm Tris, 150 mm NaCl, 0.1% Tween 20) containing 5% skim milk powder for 1 h, followed by incubation with the appropriate primary antibody overnight at 4 °C, and then a horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibody for 1 h at room temperature. All blots were visualized using the ECL kit from Amersham Biosciences. Statistics—The statistical analysis of the migration experiments was performed using the two-tailed Student's t test. The statistical analysis on the 45Ca release experiments was performed using a paired two-tailed Student's t test. *, p < 0.05; **, p < 0.01; ***, p < 0.001. RANKL and VEGF Induce Osteoclast Invasion—Through their function in osteoclastogenesis and angiogenesis, respectively, RANKL and VEGF have already been ascribed important but distinct roles in the development of bone. We hypothesized an additional and overlapping role for the two growth factors as integral parts of the osteoclast recruitment machinery. To study the effect of RANKL and VEGF on osteoclast motility we used the modified Boyden chambers coated with a type I collagen gel. When RANKL was exclusively added to the lower chamber we observed a dose-dependent increase in OCL invasion from the upper chamber through the type I collagen matrix into the lower chamber (Fig. 1A). Maximal activation was obtained at RANKL concentrations of 100 ng/ml or higher, resulting in an increase of 70–90% of the invasion. Addition of RANKL to the upper chamber did not significantly activate OCL invasion, showing that RANKL induces invasion in a chemotactic manner. Addition of 300 ng/ml of hOPG-Fc completely abrogated the RANKL-induced invasion, without affecting the basal level of migration. Importantly, we did not observe any differences in osteoclast number between the treated and non-treated conditions (data not shown). We have previously mentioned that VEGF stimulates osteoclast invasion (3.Engsig M.T. Chen Q.J. Vu T.H. Pedersen A.C. Therkidsen B. Lund L.R. Henriksen K. Lenhard T. Foged N.T. Werb Z. Delaisse J.M. J. Cell Biol. 2000; 151: 879-890Crossref PubMed Scopus (491) Google Scholar). Here we observed a biphasic dose-dependent induction of invasion against the VEGF concentration gradient (Fig. 1B), with optimal stimulation at 1 ng/ml where the invasion is increased by 40–50% when compared with the non-stimulated controls. Similar to RANKL, addition of VEGF to the upper chamber did not result in a significant activation, showing that VEGF also stimulates OCL invasion in a chemotactic manner. Addition of soluble VEGF-receptor sFlt-Fc completely inhibited VEGF-induced invasion, whereas basal invasion was unaffected. Several VEGF receptors exist, of which both Flt-1 and Flk-1 have been observed in osteoclasts (10.Niida S. Kaku M. Amano H. Yoshida H. Kataoka H. Nishikawa S. Tanne K. Maeda N. Nishikawa S. Kodama H. J. Exp. Med. 1999; 190: 293-298Crossref PubMed Scopus (361) Google Scholar, 11.Gerber H.P. Vu T.H. Ryan A.M. Kowalski J. Werb Z. Ferrara N. Nat.

FEBS Lett. 2000; 473: 161-164Crossref PubMed Scopus (314) Google Scholar). Addition of the Flt-1-specific ligand placenta growth factor-2 (PlGF-2) to the modified Boyden chambers resulted in increased invasion similar to addition of VEGF, indicating at least a partial role of Flt-1 in the process. M-CSF has previously been described as a powerful chemotactic factor for osteoclasts (8.Fuller K. Owens J.M. Jagger C.J. Wilson A. Moss R. Chambers T.J. J. Exp. Med. 1993; 178: 1733-1744Crossref PubMed Scopus (313) Google Scholar, 25.Nakamura I. Lipfert L. Rodan G.A. Le T.D. J. Cell Biol. 2001; 152: 361-373Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar); however, studies with M-CSF in the modified Boyden Chamber have never been reported. In our system M-CSF acted as a chemoattractant, activating OCL invasion to levels comparable with RANKL and VEGF stimulation, with maximal activation (50–60% increase when compared with baseline levels) of motility being reached at 5 ng/ml of M-CSF and higher. Endostatin Inhibits VEGF-stimulated Osteoclast Migration— Endostatin is a known antagonist of VEGF-mediated endothelial cell migration and proliferation (26.Yamaguchi N. Anand-Apte B. Lee M. Sasaki T. Fukai N. Shapiro R. Que I. Lowik C. Timpl R. Olsen B.R. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 4414-4423Crossref PubMed Scopus (426) Google Scholar, 27.Taddei L. Chiarugi P. Brogelli L. Cirri P. Magnelli L. Raugei G. Ziche M. Granger H.J. Chiarugi V. Ramponi G. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1999; 263: 340-345Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). Its effects on other cell types and cytokine-mediated signals, however, still remain to be studied. We tested the effect of endostatin on VEGF-, RANKL-, M-CSF-, and PlGF-2-stimulated osteoclast invasion through type I collagen in the modified Boyden chamber. Endostatin completely inhibited VEGF (Fig. 2A) and PlGF-2 (Fig. 2D)-mediated invasion, whereas no effect was observed on RANKL- (Fig. 2B) or M-CSF- (Fig. 2C) mediated invasion, suggesting it is specific for VEGF receptor-mediated signaling. We did not observe any differences in osteoclast number between the treated and non-treated conditions (data not shown). Preincubation of cells with endostatin for 30 min was necessary for endostatin to exert its inhibitory effect (data not shown), corresponding with previous findings in endothelial cell migration studies (26.Yamaguchi N. Anand-Apte B. Lee M. Sasaki T. Fukai N. Shapiro R. Que I. Lowik C. Timpl R. Olsen B.R. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 4414-4423Crossref PubMed Scopus (426) Google Scholar). Antagonists of RANKL and VEGF Inhibit Calcium Release from Cultured Primitive Long Bones—The murine metatarsal system provides an excellent model for studying osteoclast recruitment during bone development. When metatarsals are isolated from 17-day old embryos, osteoclast precursors are present in the periosteum surrounding the calcified cartilage of the primitive long bone. During subsequent culture the osteoclast precursors mature, fuse, and begin invasion through the type I collagen-rich bone collar into the soon-to-be marrow cavity. In contrast, in tibiae isolated from 17-day-old mouse embryos, mature actively resorbing osteoclasts are already present on the bone surface of the marrow cavity, and no further recruitment is necessary for resorption (2.Blavier L. Delaisse J.M. J. Cell Sci. 1995; 108: 3649-3659PubMed Google Scholar, 28.Dieudonne S.C. Foo P. van Zoelen E.J. Burger E.H. J. Bone Miner. Res. 1991; 6: 479-487Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). In order to investigate whether RANKL plays a physiologically relevant role in osteoclast recruitment during bone development, we studied the effect of recombinant hOPG-Fc in the two bone models. Addition of 500 ng/ml of hOPG-Fc led to complete inhibition of the 45Ca release from the metatarsals showing that RANKL indeed plays a role in bone development (Fig. 3A). Although it can not be ruled out that part of this inhibition is due to the effect of hOPG-Fc on osteoclastic differentiation, we observed the presence of osteoclasts inside, as well as outside the periosteum of the hOPG-Fc treated metatarsals by histological analysis (data not shown), thus confirming that recruitment and not only osteoclastogenesis is impaired. We also found that hOPG-Fc inhibited the demineralization of the tibia to ∼50% of the control levels, thus confirming previous findings (29.Tsukii K. Shima N. Mochizuki S. Yamaguchi K. Kinosaki M. Yano K. Shibata O. Udagawa N. Yasuda H. Suda T. Higashio K. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1998; 246: 337-341Crossref PubMed Scopus (221) Google Scholar). We have previously reported that addition of a soluble VEGF receptor led to a decrease in osteoclast recruitment in the metatarsals (3.Engsig M.T. Chen Q.J. Vu T.H. Pedersen A.C. Therkidsen B. Lund L.R. Henriksen K. Lenhard T. Foged N.T. Werb Z. Delaisse J.M. J. Cell Biol. 2000; 151: 879-890Crossref PubMed Scopus (491) Google Scholar). Here we find that, although not as efficient as hOPG-Fc, addition of 60 ng/ml endostatin inhibits osteoclast recruitment in this system (Fig. 3B), thus further supporting an important role of VEGF in bone development. Interestingly we found that endostatin did not inhibit Ca45 release in the tibia model, suggesting that inhibition of VEGF does not affect resorption, but only recruitment. RANKL, VEGF, and M-CSF induce MAPK (ERK1/2) Activation—The MAP kinases ERK1/2 and p38 are involved in several cellular processes, such as proliferation, cell survival, differentiation, and cytokine-activated migration. We hypothesized that RANKL- and VEGF-mediated osteoclast recruitment might involve MAPK phosphorylation. In order to have cell populations devoid of contaminating cell types such as stromal cells we studied MAPK activation in spleen cell-derived osteoclasts (SOCs) instead of OCLs. Addition of RANKL led to activation of ERK1/2 within 30 min after stimulation (upper panels, Fig. 4A). This activation was sustained throughout the 2-hour period tested. Total level of ERK1/2 protein was unchanged for the entire period. No activation of p38 was observed (lower two panels, Fig. 4A). VEGF induces ERK1/2 activation with kinetics highly similar to those of RANKL (Fig. 4B). Correspondingly, VEGF stimulation did not lead to activation of p38 (Fig. 4B). As expected from Refs. 17.Miyazaki T. Katagiri H. Kanegae Y. Takayanagi H. Sawada Y. Yamamoto A. Pando M.P. Asano T. Verma I.M. Oda H. Nakamura K. Tanaka S. J. Cell Biol. 2000; 148: 333-342Crossref PubMed Scopus (343) Google Scholar and 25.Nakamura I. Lipfert L. Rodan G.A. Le T.D. J. Cell Biol. 2001; 152: 361-373Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar, M-CSF activated ERK1/2. However, with a maximal activation already after 10 min, followed by a reduction in the activation level, as previously described (17.Miyazaki T. Katagiri H. Kanegae Y. Takayanagi H. Sawada Y. Yamamoto A. Pando M.P. Asano T. Verma I.M. Oda H. Nakamura K. Tanaka S. J. Cell Biol. 2000; 148: 333-342Crossref PubMed Scopus (343) Google Scholar). Thus, the biphasic kinetic profile of M-CSF differed from those of RANKL and VEGF. Again, no effect on p38 activation was observed (Fig. 4C). Finally, we found that PlGF-2 activated ERK1/2 with a kinetic pattern similar to VEGF (Fig. 4D), indicating that Flt-1 is responsible for the ERK1/2 activation by VEGF. Inhibition of ERK1/2 Activation by PD98059 in Cytokine-activated Osteoclast Migration—To study whether the cytokine-induced ERK1/2 activation is involved in osteoclast migration, we used PD98059, which specifically blocks the ERK1/2, but not the p38 MAP kinase pathways (30.Dudley D.T.

Addition of PD98059 completely abrogated both RANKL- and VEGF-stimulated OCLs invasion in the modified Boyden chamber (Fig. 5, A and B), without affecting the osteoclast number (data not shown), suggesting that ERK1/2 play an important role in osteoclast"

The early onset hereditary spastic paraplegia SPG3A is caused by mutations in the atlastin/human guanylate-binding protein-3 gene (renamed here atlastin-1), which codes for a 64-kDa member of the dynamin/Mx/guanylate-binding protein superfamily of large GTPases. The atlastin-1 protein is localized predominantly in brain, where it is enriched in pyramidal neurons in the cerebral cortex and hippocampus. In cultured cortical neurons, atlastin-1 co-localized most prominently with markers of the Golgi apparatus, and immunogold electron microscopy revealed a predominant localization of atlastin-1 to the cis-Golgi. Yeast two-hybrid analyses and co-immunoprecipitation studies demonstrated that atlastin-1 can self-associate, and gel-exclusion chromatography and chemical cross-linking studies indicated that atlastin-1 exists as an oligomer in vivo, most likely a tetramer. Membrane fractionation and protease protection assays revealed that atlastin-1 is an integral membrane protein with two predicted transmembrane domains; both the N-terminal GTP-binding and C-terminal domains are exposed to the cytoplasm.

They typically exhibit axonal degeneration in the distal portions of long ascending dorsal column fibers and descending corticospinal tracts of the spinal cord, which constitute the longest motor and sensory axons in the central nervous system (6.Schwartz G.A. Liu C.-N. Arch. Neurol. Psychiatry. 1956; 75: 144-162Crossref Scopus (100) Google Scholar). HSPs have historically been classified as “pure” or “uncomplicated” if spastic paraplegia occurs in isolation and “complicated” if other neurological abnormalities are present (7.Harding A.E. Lancet. 1983; 1: 1151-1155Abstract PubMed Scopus (786) Google Scholar). More recently, the identification of new genetic loci for HSPs has permitted a molecular classification of HSPs (2.Crosby A.H. Proukakis C. Am. J. Hum. Genet. 2002; 71: 1009-1016Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar, 3.Fink J.K. Ann.

Genet. 2003; 40: 81-86Crossref PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar). Of the 20 known loci (SPG1–20), 11 are autosomal dominant, six are autosomal recessive, and three are X-linked. Although most HSP patients experience progressive worsening of their symptoms, for some, the disorder does not appear to be progressive (3.Fink J.K. Ann. Neurol. 2002; 51: 669-672Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar, 4.Fink J.K. Neurol. Clin. 2002; 20: 711-726Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). Thus, although some HSPs are clearly neurodegenerative disorders (e.g. SPG4), others such as SPG1 (due to mutations in the L1 cell adhesion molecule) and SPG3A (due to mutations in the atlastin GTPase) may be neurodevelopmental disorders (3.Fink J.K. Ann. Neurol. 2002; 51: 669-672Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar, 4.Fink J.K. Neurol.

Eight disease genes for HSPs have now been identified; and based on the proteins involved, several mechanisms for pathogenesis have been advanced. These include aberrant cell signaling or migration, abnormalities of mitochondrial chaperones, abnormalities of myelination, and defects in intracellular trafficking and transport (2.Crosby A.H. Proukakis C. Am. J. Hum. Genet. 2002; 71: 1009-1016Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar, 3.Fink J.K. Ann.

Genet. 2003; 40: 81-86Crossref PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar). Proteins mutated in HSPs that have been implicated in cellular protein or vesicle trafficking include KIF5A (SPG10), spastin (SPG4), spartin (SPG20; Troyer syndrome), and atlastin (SPG3A) (reviewed in Refs. 2.Crosby A.H. Proukakis C. Am. J. Hum. Genet. 2002; 71: 1009-1016Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar, 3.Fink J.K. Ann.

Genet. 2003; 40: 81-86Crossref PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar). KIF5A is a neuronal kinesin heavy chain motor protein involved in the transport of macromolecules and membranous organelles along the axon (8.Reid E. Kloos M. Ashley-Koch A. Hughes L. Bevan S. Svenson I.K. Graham F.L. Gaskell P.C. Dearlove A. Pericak-Vance M.A. Rubinsztein D.C. Marchuk D.A. Am. J. Hum. Genet. 2002; 71: 1189-1194Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (426) Google Scholar). Spastin, a member of the AAA (for ATPases associated with a variety of cellular activities) protein family, associates with microtubules, and spastin overexpression causes microtubule disassembly (9.Errico A. Ballabio A. Rugarli E.I. Hum. Mol. Genet. 2002; 11: 153-163Crossref PubMed Scopus (284) Google Scholar). The spartin protein is similar to the VPS4, SNX15 (sorting nexin-15), and SKD1 proteins, which are involved in endosome morphology and protein trafficking of endosomal compartments (10.Patel H. Cross H. Proukakis C. Hershberger R. Bork P. Ciccarelli F.D. Patton M.A. McKusick V.A. Crosby A.H. Nat. Genet. 2002; 31: 347-348Crossref PubMed Scopus (212) Google Scholar). These latter proteins share with both spastin and spartin a region called the MIT (contained within microtubule-interacting and trafficking molecules) or ESP (present in End13/VPS4, SNX15, and PalB) domain (2.Crosby A.H. Proukakis C. Am. J. Hum. Genet. 2002; 71: 1009-1016Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar, 11.Ciccarelli F.D. Proukakis C. Patel H. Cross H. Azam S. Patton M.A. Bork P. Crosby A.H. Genomics. 2003; 81: 437-441Crossref PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar). Based on its similarity to members of the dynamin/Mx/guanylate-binding protein (GBP) superfamily of large GTPases (12.Prakash B. Praefcke G.J.K. Renault L. Wittinghofer A. Herrmann C. Nature. 2000; 403: 567-571Crossref PubMed Scopus (256) Google Scholar), the SPG3A protein atlastin (renamed here atlastin-1) has been implicated in intracellular trafficking, yet little is known regarding its cellular localization or function (13.Zhao X. Alvarado D. Rainier S. Lemons R. Hedera P. Weber C.H. Tukel T. Apak M. Heiman-Patterson T. Ming L. Bui M. Fink J.K. Nat. Genet. 2001; 29: 326-331Crossref PubMed Scopus (298) Google Scholar). Among the HSPs, SPG3A is particularly notable for the very early onset of pure spastic paraplegia. Five missense mutations and one single base insertion with premature termination of the predicted 558-amino acid coding region of atlastin-1 have been reported (13.Zhao X. Alvarado D. Rainier S. Lemons R. Hedera P. Weber C.H. Tukel T. Apak M. Heiman-Patterson T. Ming L. Bui M. Fink J.K. Nat. Genet. 2001; 29: 326-331Crossref PubMed Scopus (298) Google Scholar, 14.Muglia M. Magariello A. Nicoletti G. Patitucci A. Gabriele A.L. Conforti F.L. Mazzei R. Caracciolo M. Ardito B. Lastilla M. Tedeschi G. Quattrone A. Ann.

Neurology. 2003; 61: 580-581Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). It has been speculated that these mutations may alter the structure, interactions, or GTPase activity of atlastin-1 (13.Zhao X. Alvarado D. Rainier S. Lemons R. Hedera P. Weber C.H. Tukel T. Apak M. Heiman-Patterson T. Ming L. Bui M. Fink J.K. Nat. Genet. 2001; 29: 326-331Crossref PubMed Scopus (298) Google Scholar, 14.Muglia M. Magariello A. Nicoletti G. Patitucci A. Gabriele A.L. Conforti F.L.

Sartori E. Mostacciuolo M.L. Daga A. Bassi M.T. Martinuzzi A. Neurology. 2003; 61: 580-581Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). Of the members of the dynamin/Mx/GBP superfamily, atlastin-1 is most similar to GBPs. Like GBPs, atlastin-1 possesses an RD loop instead of the classical (N/T)KXD sequence within the third motif of the guanylate-binding consensus triad (13.Zhao X. Alvarado D. Rainier S. Lemons R. Hedera P. Weber C.H. Tukel T. Apak M. Heiman-Patterson T. Ming L. Bui M. Fink J.K. Nat. Genet. 2001; 29: 326-331Crossref PubMed Scopus (298) Google Scholar). However, atlastin-1 lacks a C-terminal isoprenylation motif and the C-terminal α12/13 helix motif, two characteristic structural features of many of the GBPs (12.Prakash B. Praefcke G.J.K. Renault L. Wittinghofer A. Herrmann C. Nature. 2000; 403: 567-571Crossref PubMed Scopus (256) Google Scholar). Here, we demonstrate that atlastin-1 is an oligomeric GTPase that, unlike GBPs, is composed of subunits that are integral membrane proteins, with both N and C termini exposed to the cytoplasmic compartment. Atlastin-1 localizes prominently to the Golgi apparatus and is enriched in cerebral cortical pyramidal cells, a subpopulation of which exhibit a “long axonopathy” in patients with SPG3A. Sequence Analysis—Atlastin-1 homologs were identified with BLAST (17.Altschul S.F. Madden T.L. Schaffer A.A. Zhang J. Zhang Z. Miller W. Lipman D.J. Nucleic Acids Res. 1997; 25: 3389-3402Crossref PubMed Scopus (60233) Google Scholar). Chromosomal assignments were made using the NCBI Map-Viewer. 2Available at www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov. Transmembrane helical domains were predicted using the SOSUI system (18.Hirokawa T. Boon-Chieng S. Mitaku S. Bioinformatics. 1998; 14: 378-379Crossref PubMed Scopus (1577) Google Scholar). Protein alignments were performed with ClustalW (19.Thompson J.D. Higgins D.G. Gibson T.J. Nucleic Acids Res. 1994; 22: 4673-4680Crossref PubMed Scopus (56003) Google Scholar). Protein sequence similarities were calculated using BESTFIT analysis (Wisconsin Package Version 10.3, Accelrys, San Diego, CA). Eukaryotic DNA Expression Constructs and Cell Transfection—The full coding sequence of the atlastin-1 GTPase (GenBank™/EBI accession number NM_015915) was amplified by PCR using Pfu Turbo (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA) from a Marathon human brain (cerebral cortex) cDNA library (Clontech) and confirmed by DNA sequencing. The full-length atlastin-1 cDNA was cloned into the XmaI site of the eukaryotic expression vector pGW1 with Myc or hemagglutinin (HA) epitope tags at the N terminus as described previously (20.Blackstone C. Roberts R.G. Seeburg D.P. Sheng M. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2003; 305: 345-352Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar). The full-length atlastin-1 cDNA was also cloned into the XmaI site of pRK5 (Genentech, South San Francisco, CA) for expression of the untagged protein. Torsin A (accession number AF007871) was cloned as a HindIII-BglII fragment into pGW1, preceding an in-frame C-terminal Myc tag. Site-directed mutagenesis was performed using the QuikChange method (Stratagene). African green monkey COS-7 cells (American Type Culture Collection CRL-1651) were maintained, transfected, and harvested as described previously (20.Blackstone C. Roberts R.G. Seeburg D.P. Sheng M. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2003; 305: 345-352Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar). Antibodies—Affinity-purified antibodies against residues 1–18 (No. 5409; MAKNRRDRNSWGGFSEKTC-amide) and 544–558 (No. 4735; acetyl-CTPKSESTEQSEKKKM-OH) of atlastin-1 were prepared commercially (BioSource International, Hopkinton, MA), with terminal cysteines added to facilitate coupling. Antibodies were also prepared against residues 947–960 (No. 5174; acetyl-CEKLDAFIEALHQEK-OH) of human OPA1/Mgm1 (GenBank™/EBI accession number NM_ 015560) (21.Alexander C. Votruba M. Pesch U.E.

Mouse monoclonal anti-Myc (9E10), rabbit polyclonal anti-HA probe (Y-11), and goat anti-calregulin (T-19) antibodies were from Santa Cruz Biotechnology (Santa Cruz, CA). Rabbit polyclonal anti-deafness-dystonia protein-1 (DDP1)/TIMM8a antibodies have been described previously (20.Blackstone C. Roberts R.G. Seeburg D.P. Sheng M. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2003; 305: 345-352Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar). Mouse monoclonal anti-calnexin (IgG1), anti-GM130 (IgG1), and anti-p115 (IgG1) antibodies were from Pharmingen. Mouse monoclonal anti-KDEL antibodies (clone 10C3, IgG2a) were from Stressgen Biotech Corp. (Victoria, British Columbia, Canada). Mouse monoclonal anti-microtubule-associated protein-2 antibody (clone HM-2, mouse ascites) was obtained from Sigma. Tissue Preparation and Subcellular Fractionation—Human tissue homogenates were obtained from Clontech. Brain subcellular fractions were prepared from Sprague-Dawley rats (150–175 g; Charles River Laboratories, Wilmington, MA). Dissected brains were homogenized in 0.32 m sucrose and 10 mm HEPES (pH 7.4) and centrifuged at 1330 × g for 3 min, generating a pellet (P1) and a supernatant (S1). The S1 supernatant was centrifuged at 21,200 × g for 10 min, producing a pellet (P2) and a supernatant (S2). The S2 supernatant was then centrifuged at 200,000 × g for 1 h, generating a P3 pellet and an S3 supernatant. Protein concentrations were determined by the BCA assay (Pierce) with bovine serum albumin as the standard. Gel Electrophoresis and Immunoblotting—Proteins were resolved by SDS-PAGE on 10 or 14% acrylamide gels and electrophoretically transferred to nitrocellulose (Hybond ECL, Amersham Biosciences). After blocking with 5% nonfat milk, 0.1% Tween 20, and Tris-buffered saline (pH 7.4) overnight, antibodies (0.1–1.0 μg/ml) were added for 1 h at 25 °C. After several washes with 0.1% Tween 20 and Tris-buffered saline, horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibodies (1:3000 dilution; Amersham Biosciences) were added for 30 min. Finally, after several washes with the blocking buffer, followed by Tris-buffered saline, immunoreactive proteins were revealed using Renaissance enhanced chemiluminescence reagent (PerkinElmer Life Sciences). Immunohistochemistry—Three adult male Sprague-Dawley rats (150–200 g) were perfused transcardially under deep pentobarbital anesthesia with 0.9% NaCl in 0.1 m phosphate buffer (pH 7.4), followed by 4% paraformaldehyde and finally 10% sucrose in 0.1 m phosphate buffer. Brains were post-fixed for 1 h and incubated overnight in phosphate-buffered 30% sucrose. Brains were then placed on a freezing microtome and cut into 50-μm-thick sections. These sections were collected in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS; pH 7.4) and stored at –20 °C in a cryoprotective solution consisting of 30% sucrose and 30% ethylene glycol in 0.05 m phosphate buffer (pH 7.2) until used. The immunohistochemical reaction was carried out using the ABC Elite kit (Vector Labs, Inc., Burlingame, CA) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Sections were preincubated in 1.0% normal goat serum (NGS), 10% bovine serum albumin, and PBS for 30 min at 25 °C and then incubated for 48 h at 4 °C with anti-atlastin-1 antibodies (No. 5409; 0.7 μg/ml) in 0.1% NGS, 1% bovine serum albumin, and PBS. In control experiments, the anti-atlastin-1 antibodies (No. 5409) were preincubated with the immunogenic peptide (0.25 μm) prior to use. The sections were then rinsed with PBS and incubated with biotinylated anti-rabbit IgG (Vector Labs, Inc.) in PBS with 1.5% NGS for 1 h at 25 °C. After rinsing with PBS, sections were incubated with the ABC complex (Vector Labs, Inc.) for 45 min and rinsed again. Peroxidase staining was revealed using 3,3′-diaminobenzidine (Fast DAB kit, Sigma). Sections were mounted on Superfrost Plus slides (Fisher), air-dried, dehydrated, and coverslipped with Cytoseal 60 (Stephens Scientific, Riverdale, NJ). Neuronal Culture and Immunocytochemistry—Primary cultures of rat cortical neurons were prepared from embryonic day 18 rat embryos and maintained as described previously (23.Zheng Y.-l. Li B.-S. Veeranna Pant H.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 24026-24032Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). After 6 days in culture, neurons were fixed with 4% formaldehyde for 30 min at 25 °C; washed several times with PBS; and then permeabilized and blocked for 30 min in 5% NGS, 0.2% saponin, and PBS. Cells were incubated overnight at 4 °C with antibodies against atlastin-1 (No. 5409; 10 μg/ml) and microtubule-associated protein-2 (1:200 dilution), p115 (0.5 μg/ml), GM130 (0.5 μg/ml), or KDEL (1.9 μg/ml) in 3% NGS, 0.05% saponin, and PBS. After washing three times with PBS, cells were incubated with Alexa Fluor 488- and Alexa Fluor 568-conjugated secondary antibodies (1:500 dilution; Molecular Probes, Inc., Eugene, OR) in 3% NGS, 0.05% saponin, and PBS for 30 min, followed by three washes with PBS. Coverslips were then mounted using Gel/Mount (Biomeda, Foster City, CA). Fluorescent images were acquired with a Zeiss Axiovert 100M laser scanning confocal microscope and processed with Adobe Photoshop software. Immunogold Electron Microscopy—Rat cortical neuron cultures were prepared as described above. After 6 days in culture, neurons were fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde in 0.1 m phosphate buffer (pH 7.4) for 30 min and then washed with 0.1 m phosphate buffer. The cells were permeabilized and blocked in 5% NGS, 0.1% saponin, and PBS for 1 h and incubated with anti-atlastin-1 antibodies (No. 5409) or without primary antibodies as a control in blocking buffer for 1 h. After washing with 1% NGS in PBS with 2% nonfat milk in PBS, cells were incubated with 1.4-nm Nanogold gold-conjugated anti-rabbit secondary antibodies (1:250 dilution; Nanoprobes, Yaphank, NY) in 2% nonfat milk in PBS for 1 h. After washing with 2% nonfat milk in PBS, the cells were fixed with 2% glutaraldehyde in PBS for 30 min. Finally, the cells were thoroughly washed with PBS and distilled water, silver-enhanced (HQ silver kit, Nanoprobes), and washed again with water and 0.1 m phosphate buffer. The cells were treated with 0.2% OsO4 in 0.1 m phosphate buffer for 30 min, mordanted en bloc with 0.25% uranyl acetate in acetate buffer (pH 5.0) overnight, washed and dehydrated with serial concentrations of ethanol, and finally infiltrated and embedded in epoxy resins. Thin sections of ∼70 nm were counterstained with uranyl acetate and lead citrate and examined under a Jeol 1200 EXII transmission electron microscope. Digital images were collected with an XR-100 CCD camera (Advanced Microscopy Techniques, Danvers, MA). Membrane Association Assays—COS-7 cells overexpressing atlastin-1 were washed twice with 10 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5) and then harvested in 10 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 10 mm NaCl, and 1.5 mm MgCl2. After multiple passes through a 25-gauge needle, the homogenate was centrifuged at 1330 × g. The post-nuclear supernatant was sonicated and then recentrifuged at 200,000 × g for 60 min, yielding a pellet (lysed membrane fraction) and a soluble fraction. The membrane fraction was treated with 1 m NaCl and 25 mm phosphate buffer (pH 7.4), with 100 mm glycine buffer (pH 2.8), with 100 mm carbonate buffer (pH 11.0), with 0.1% Triton X-100 and PBS, or with 1.0% sodium deoxycholate and PBS as indicated and centrifuged at 200,000 × g for 60 min to generate a final pellet and supernatant. In other experiments, soluble and membrane fractions were prepared from COS-7 cells overexpressing Myc-tagged wild-type atlastin-1 or various Myc-tagged atlastin-1 deletion constructs. Equal proportions of the soluble and membrane fractions were then immunoblotted with anti-Myc antibodies. Membranes from COS-7 cells overexpressing untagged atlastin-1 and P3 membrane fractions prepared from rat brain were subjected to phase partitioning with Triton X-114 as described by Bordier (24.Bordier C. J. Biol. Chem. 1981; 256: 1604-1607Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), and equal proportions of the aqueous and detergent phases were immunoblotted with anti-atlastin-1 antibodies (No. 5409). Protease Digestion and Deglycosylation Assays—COS-7 cells overexpressing untagged atlastin-1 were washed twice with 10 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5) and then collected in 10 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 10 mm NaCl, 1.5 mm MgCl2, and 10% sucrose. Cells were passed through a 25-gauge needle, and the homogenate was centrifuged at 3000 × g for 3 min. The pellet was discarded, and the supernatant was centrifuged at 130,000 × g for 60 min. This latter pellet was resuspended in the same buffer with or without proteinase K (EC 3.4.21.64; Sigma) at either 50 μm (30 min, 25 °C) or 200 μm (15 min, 37 °C). Reactions were terminated with 2 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, followed immediately by lysis in SDS-PAGE sample buffer. Samples were then immunoblotted with antibodies against the C terminus (No. 4735) or N terminus (No. 5409) of atlastin-1 or with anti-calregulin antibodies. Protein deglycosylation with peptide N-glycosidase F (EC 3.5.1.52; New England Biolabs Inc., Beverly, MA) was performed as described previously (25.Blackstone C.D. Moss S.J. Martin L.J. Levey A.I. Price D.L. Huganir R.L. J. Neurochem. 1992; 58: 1118-1126Crossref PubMed Scopus (217) Google Scholar). Yeast Two-hybrid Tests—Yeast two-hybrid tests were performed using the L40 yeast strain harboring the reporter genes HIS3 and β-galactosidase under the control of upstream LexA-binding sites as described previously (20.Blackstone C. Roberts R.G. Seeburg D.P. Sheng M. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2003; 305: 345-352Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar). Atlastin-1 deletion constructs were produced by PCR amplification using Pfu Turbo and cloned in-frame into pGAD10 prey and pBHA bait vectors (Clontech). All constructs were confirmed by DNA sequencing. Strength of interaction was assayed by β-galactosidase and HIS3 induction as described previously (20.Blackstone C. Roberts R.G. Seeburg D.P. Sheng M. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2003; 305: 345-352Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar). Immunoprecipitation and Chemical Cross-linking—COS-7 cells co-transfected with HA- and Myc-atlastin-1 or transfected with Myc-atlastin-1 alone were washed twice with PBS and then harvested in 0.5% Triton X-100 and PBS and clarified by centrifugation at 130,000 × g for 30 min. Extracts (100 μg of protein) were incubated for 1–2 h at 4 °C with 5 μg of rabbit polyclonal anti-HA probe antibodies (Y-11) pre-coupled to protein A-Sepharose CL-4B (Amersham Biosciences). Beads were washed three times with 0.5% Triton X-100 and PBS. Bound proteins were resolved by SDS-PAGE and immunoblotted with mouse monoclonal anti-Myc antibodies. Chemical cross-linking with dithiobis(succinimidyl propionate) (Pierce) was performed using high speed pellets from the post-nuclear supernatant derived from Myc-atlastin-1-overexpressing COS-7 cells. Pellets were resuspended in PBS, and dithiobis(succinimidyl propionate) was added for 30 min on ice. Cross-linked products were resolved by SDS-PAGE under nonreducing conditions and immunoblotted with anti-Myc antibodies. Gel-exclusion FPLC—Myc-tagged wild-type or deletion mutants of atlastin-1 overexpressed in COS-7 cells were lysed in 0.1% Triton X-100 and PBS and clarified by centrifugation at 130,000 × g for 30 min. The soluble extract was applied to a Superdex 200 HR10/30 FPLC column (Amersham Biosciences) at a flow rate of 0.25 ml/min in 0.1% Triton X-100 and PBS. Fractions (0.25 ml) were collected, and proteins were resolved by SDS-PAGE and then immunoblotted using anti-Myc antibodies. Protein standards (Sigma and Amersham Biosciences) in 0.1% Triton X-100 and PBS were applied to the column to generate a standard curve, from which the native molecular masses for wild-type and deletion mutants of atlastin-1 were calculated. GTPase Activity Assays—The atlastin-1 cDNA was subcloned into pCAL-n-EK for the production of calmodulin-binding peptide (CBP) fusion proteins (Stratagene). Expression of CBP-atlastin-1 in Escherichia coli BL21(DE3) was induced by 100 μm isopropyl-β-d-thiogalactopyranoside for 4.5 h at 25 °C. After pelleting, cells were resuspended in 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.0), 150 mm NaCl, 5 mm MgCl2, 2 mm CaCl2, 10% glycerol, 10 mm β-mercaptoethanol, 1.0% Triton X-100, and 0.5 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride and ruptured by two passages through a French pressure cell at 10,000 p.s.i. The extract was clarified by centrifugation at 50,000 × g for 30 min and then applied to calmodulin affinity resin (Stratagene). After washing with 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.0), 150 mm NaCl, 5 mm MgCl2, 2 mm CaCl2, 10 mm β-mercaptoethanol, and 0.1% Triton X-100, bound fusion proteins were eluted with 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.0), 150 mm NaCl, 10 mm β-mercaptoethanol, 2 mm EGTA, and 0.1% Triton X-100. Affinity-purified CBP-atlastin-1 fusion protein was dialyzed against assay buffer (20 mm HEPES (pH 7.2), 2 mm MgCl2, and 1 mm dithiothreitol). The reaction mixture for the GTPase assay included dialyzed CBP-atlastin-1 with 0.05% bovine serum albumin and 0.825 μm [α-32P]GTP (3000 Ci/mmol; ICN Biomedicals, Irvine, CA) in assay buffer. Samples of the reaction mixture at various time points (0–60 min) were spotted onto polyethyleneimine cellulose on polyester TLC plates (Sigma). Guanine nucleotides were separated by ascending chromatography in 1 m LiCl and 1.2 m formic acid. The [32P]GDP and [32P]GTP spots"

In search of a biological function, two conflicting theories proposed that due to its inhibitor-resistant activity mesotrypsin could prematurely activate or degrade pancreatic zymogens and thus play a pathogenic or protective role in human pancreatitis. In the present study we ruled out both theories by demonstrating that mesotrypsin was grossly defective not only in inhibitor binding, but also in the activation or degradation of pancreatic zymogens. We found that the restricted ability of mesotrypsin to bind inhibitors or to hydrolyze protein substrates was solely due to a single evolutionary mutation, which changed the serine-protease signature glycine 198 residue to arginine. Remarkably, the same mutation endowed mesotrypsin with a novel and unique function: mesotrypsin rapidly hydrolyzed the reactive-site peptide bond of the Kunitz-type trypsin inhibitor SBTI, and irreversibly degraded the Kazal-type temporary inhibitor SPINK1. The observations suggest that the biological function of human mesotrypsin is digestive degradation of trypsin inhibitors. This mechanism can facilitate the digestion of foods rich in natural trypsin inhibitors. Furthermore, the findings raise the possibility that inappropriate activation of mesotrypsinogen in the pancreas might lower protective SPINK1 levels and contribute to the development of human pancreatitis. In this regard, it is noteworthy that the well known pathological trypsinogen activator cathepsin B exhibited a preference for the activation of mesotrypsinogen of all three human trypsinogen isoforms, suggesting a biochemical mechanism for mesotrypsinogen activation in pancreatic acinar cells.

In this regard, it is noteworthy that the well known pathological trypsinogen activator cathepsin B exhibited a preference for the activation of mesotrypsinogen of all three human trypsinogen isoforms, suggesting a biochemical mechanism for mesotrypsinogen activation in pancreatic acinar cells. The human pancreas secretes three isoforms of trypsinogen, which are encoded by the PRSS (protease, serine) genes PRSS1 (OMIM 276000), PRSS2 (OMIM 601564), and PRSS3. On the basis of their electrophoretic mobility, they are commonly referred to as cationic trypsinogen, anionic trypsinogen, and mesotrypsinogen. The two major isoforms, cationic and anionic trypsinogen, constitute the bulk of secreted trypsinogen, whereas levels of mesotrypsinogen were reported between 3 and 10% of total trypsinogen content in normal pancreatic juice (see Table I in Ref. 1.Rinderknecht H.

A cDNA coding for mesotrypsinogen was cloned from human pancreas in 1997 (5.Nyaruhucha C.N.M. Kito M. Fukuoka S.I. J. Biol.

An alternatively spliced form of mesotrypsinogen in which the signal peptide is replaced with a novel sequence encoded by an alternative exon 1 is expressed in the human brain (7.Wiegand U.

Although usually referred to as “brain trypsinogen,” there is no evidence for the activation of this novel chimeric molecule, which might have a function unrelated to proteolytic activity (8.Chen J.-M.

The most intriguing property of mesotrypsin is its resistance to polypeptide trypsin inhibitors (see Table V in Ref. 2.Rinderknecht H. Renner I.G. Abramson S.B. Carmack C.

Analysis of the recent crystal structure of mesotrypsin provided compelling evidence that the presence of an arginine residue in place of the highly conserved Gly198 (Gly193 in the chymotrypsin numbering system) is responsible for the peculiar inhibitor resistance of mesotrypsin (6.Katona G. Berglund G.I. Hajdu J. Gráf L. Szilágyi L. J. Mol. Biol. 2002; 315: 1209-1218Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). Arg198 occupies the S2′ subsite and its long side-chain sterically clashes with protein inhibitors and possibly substrates. Furthermore, the charge of the guanidino group contributes to the strong clustering of positive charges around the primary specificity pocket of mesotrypsin. However, no direct experimental evidence has ever been presented for the proposed role of Arg198. soybean trypsin inhibitor N-[2-hydroxy-1,1-bis(hydroxymethyl)ethyl]glycine. soybean trypsin inhibitor N-[2-hydroxy-1,1-bis(hydroxymethyl)ethyl]glycine. Despite the high resolution crystal structure, the biological function of mesotrypsin has remained mysterious. In two clearly conflicting theories, it was proposed that premature activation of mesotrypsin in the pancreas might cause or protect against pancreatitis, as the inhibitor-resistant trypsin activity can freely activate or degrade other pancreatic zymogens (2.Rinderknecht H. Renner I.G. Abramson S.B. Carmack C. Gastroenterology. 1984; 86: 681-692Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar, 5.Nyaruhucha C.N.M. Kito M. Fukuoka S.I. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 10573-10578Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). It was also suggested that mesotrypsin might have been “abandoned by the process of evolution,” and has no important role in digestion or pancreatic physiology (2.Rinderknecht H. Renner I.G. Abramson S.B. Carmack C. Gastroenterology. 1984; 86: 681-692Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar, 8.Chen J.-M. Ferec C. Cooper, D.N. Nature Encyclopedia of the Human Genome. Vol. 5. Nature Publishing Group, London2003: 645-650Google Scholar). In the present study we identified a unique and specific role for mesotrypsin in the degradation of trypsin inhibitors. Furthermore, we found that this distinctive enzymatic activity was endowed by the evolutionary selection of Arg198. Finally, we showed that the lysosomal cysteine protease cathepsin B activated mesotrypsinogen at a higher rate, relative to the activation of human cationic and anionic trypsinogens. The observations not only indicate a physiological role for mesotrypsin, but also suggest that premature activation of mesotrypsinogen could contribute to the pathogenesis of human pancreatitis by reducing the protective levels of SPINK1. Materials—N-CBZ-Gly-Pro-Arg-p-nitroanilide was purchased from Sigma. Suc-Ala-Ala-Pro-Phe-p-nitroanilide was from Bachem (King of Prussia, PA), ultrapure bovine enterokinase was from Biozyme Laboratories (San Diego, CA), and reagent grade bovine serum albumin was from Biocell Laboratories (Rancho Dominguez, CA). Bovine chymotrypsinogen A, TLCK-treated bovine chymotrypsin and TPCK-treated bovine trypsin was obtained from Worthington Biochemical Corp. (Lakewood, NJ). The concentration of bovine trypsin was determined by active site titration with p-nitrophenyl-p′-guanidinobenzoate (Sigma) as described in (9.Chase Jr., T. Shaw E. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1967; 29: 508-514Crossref PubMed Scopus (781) Google Scholar). Soybean (Glycine max) trypsin inhibitor (Kunitz type) was from Fluka (93619), and was further purified on an affinity column containing immobilized S200A mutant human cationic trypsin. Human SPINK1 was expressed in Saccharomyces cerevisiae and purified on the S200A affinity column. Inhibitor concentrations were determined by titration with bovine trypsin. Human pro-elastase II (ELA2A) was expressed in Escherichia coli and purified by ecotin-affinity chromatography. Details of expression for SPINK1 and ELA2A will be reported elsewhere. Ecotin, human cationic trypsinogen, and human anionic trypsinogen were expressed and purified as reported previously (10.Lengyel Z. Pál G. Sahin-Tóth M. Prot. Expr.

Human recombinant cathepsin B was a generous gift from Paul M. Steed (Research Department, Novartis Pharmaceuticals, Summit, NJ). Before use, cathepsin B was activated with 1 mm dithiothreitol (final concentration) for 30 min on ice. Expression and Purification of Mesotrypsinogen—The gene encoding mesotrypsinogen was PCR-amplified from the IMAGE clone 2659811 (GenBank™ AW182356, purchased from Incyte Genomics Reagents & Services, St. Louis, MO) and ligated into the expression plasmid pTrap (14.Gráf L.

Biochemistry. 1987; 26: 2616-2623Crossref PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar) behind the alkaline phosphatase promoter and signal-sequence. Mutation R198G was introduced via oligonucleotide-directed site-specific mutagenesis, using the overlap extension PCR mutagenesis method. Mesotrypsinogen was expressed in E. coli SM138 [F–, araD139, Δ(lac)U169, relA, rpsL, phoR], as described previously (14.Gráf L. Craik C.S. Patthy A. Roczniak S. Fletterick R.J. Rutter W.J. Biochemistry. 1987; 26: 2616-2623Crossref PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar, 15.Sahin-Tóth M. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 29699-29704Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). Typically, 2.4-liter cultures of SM138/pTrap in Luria-Bertani medium with 100 μg/ml ampicillin were grown to saturation overnight and periplasmic fractions were isolated by osmotic shock. Tris-HCl (pH 8.0) and NaCl were added to a final concentration of 20 mm and 0.2 m, respectively, and the ∼260 ml periplasm was applied directly to an ecotin affinity column (10.Lengyel Z. Pál G. Sahin-Tóth M. Prot. Expr. Purif. 1998; 12: 291-294Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). The column was washed with 20 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.0)/0.2 M NaCl, and the zymogen was eluted with 50 mm HCl. The propeptide sequence of the mature secreted trypsinogen expressed from the pTrap plasmid was Ile-Gln-Ala-Phe-Pro-Val-(Asp)4-Lys. In an attempt to increase yield, the mesotrypsinogen gene was transferred to the pTrap-T7 expression plasmid, which was originally constructed for the high level expression of human cationic trypsinogen (11.Sahin-Tóth M. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 22750-22755Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar, 12.Sahin-Tóth M. Tóth M. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2000; 278: 286-289Crossref PubMed Scopus (167) Google Scholar). The pTrap-T7 plasmid harboring the mesotrypsinogen gene was transformed into the E. coli Rosetta(DE3) strain (Novagen), which is a BL21(DE3) derivative strain carrying a chromosomal copy of T7 RNA polymerase under the control of the lacZ promoter. 50-ml cultures were grown in Luria-Bertani medium with 100 μg/ml ampicillin and 34 μg/ml chloramphenicol to an OD600 nm of 0.5, induced with 1 mm isopropyl 1-thio-β-galactopyranoside, and grown for an additional 5 h. Cells were harvested by centrifugation and inclusion bodies were isolated by sonication and centrifugation. In vitro refolding of mesotrypsinogen from the inclusion bodies was accomplished as described previously (11.Sahin-Tóth M. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 22750-22755Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar, 12.Sahin-Tóth M. Tóth M. Biochem. Biophys. Res.

Chem. 2001; 276: 24574-24580Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). Finally, re-folded zymogen was purified on an ecotin affinity column (10.Lengyel Z. Pál G. Sahin-Tóth M. Prot. Expr. Purif. 1998; 12: 291-294Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). The propeptide sequence of recombinant mesotrypsinogen expressed from the pTrap-T7 plasmid was Met-Val-Pro-Phe-(Asp)4-Lys. Concentrations of mesotrypsinogen solutions were calculated from the ultraviolet absorbance at 280 nm, using a theoretical extinction coefficient of 40,570 m–1 cm–1. Protease Activity Assays—Trypsin and chymotrypsin activity was determined using the synthetic chromogenic substrates N-CBZ-Gly-Pro-Arg-p-nitroanilide (0.1–0.14 mm final concentration) and Suc-Ala-Ala-Pro-Phe-p-nitroanilide (0.15 mm final concentration), respectively. The release of the yellow p-nitroanilide was followed at 405 nm in 0.1 m Tris-HCl (pH 8.0), 1 mm CaCl2, at 22 °C using a Spectramax Plus 384 microplate reader (Molecular Devices). Elastase was assayed with DQ-elastin fluorescent substrate (Molecular Probes, EnzCheck elastase assay kit) according to the manufacturer's instructions using a SpectraMax Gemini XS fluorescent microplate reader (Molecular Devices). Inhibitor Assays—Tight-binding inhibition of trypsin by SBTI or SPINK1 was measured by incubating 15–50 nm trypsin with given concentrations of the inhibitor in 0.1 m Tris-HCl (pH 8.0), 1 mm CaCl2, and 1.5 mg/ml bovine serum albumin for 10 min at room temperature. Residual activity was then determined with N-CBZ-Gly-Pro-Arg-p-nitroanilide as described above. With the exception of mesotrypsin, no significant dissociation of the inhibitor-trypsin complex was detectable during the 1-min assay time. Inhibitor Degradation—SBTI or SPINK1 were incubated with mesotrypsin or the indicated protease in 0.1 m Tris-HCl (pH 8.0), 1 mm CaCl2, and 1 mg/ml bovine serum albumin at 37 °C. Aliquots were withdrawn at indicated times, mixed with bovine trypsin at a concentration slightly above the initial inhibitor concentration and incubated at room temperature for 1 min before the residual trypsin activity was measured with N-CBZ-Gly-Pro-Arg-p-nitroanilide. Because association of cleaved (“modified”) SBTI to bovine trypsin is considerably slower than association of the intact (“virgin”) SBTI, the SBTI activity detected after 1 min of incubation with bovine trypsin is a specific measure of the virgin SBTI concentration (17.Luthy J.A. Praissman M. Finkenstadt W.R. Laskowski Jr., M. J. Biol. Chem. 1973; 248: 1760-1771Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Gel Electrophoresis and Densitometric Analyses—Trypsinogen and SBTI samples were precipitated with trichloroacetic acid (10% final concentration), the precipitate was dissolved in Laemmli sample buffer containing 100 mm dithiothreitol (final concentration), and samples were heat-denatured at 95 °C for 5 min. Electrophoretic separation was performed on 13% SDS-PAGE mini gels in standard Tris-glycine buffer. SPINK1 samples were precipitated with 20% trichloroacetic acid (final concentration), the precipitate was dissolved in sample buffer containing 200 mm Tris-HCl (pH 6.8), 20% glycerol, 2% SDS, 0.04% Coomassie Blue G-250, and 100 mm dithiothreitol (final concentrations). Samples were heat-denatured at 95 °C for 5 min and electrophoretic separation was performed on 16% SDS-PAGE mini gels in Tris-Tricine buffer. Gels were stained with Coomassie Brilliant Blue R for 30 min, and destained with 30% methanol, 10% acetic acid overnight. Densitometric quantitation of bands was carried out as described in Ref. 18.Kukor Z. Tóth M. Pál G. Sahin-Tóth M. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 6111-6117Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar. Expression of Mesotrypsinogen, Activation with Enterokinase, and Catalytic Properties of Mesotrypsin—Recombinant human mesotrypsinogen was expressed in two routinely used E. coli expression systems. In the SM138/pTrap expression host/plasmid system trypsinogen is constitutively secreted to the periplasmic space where it acquires its native fold. In the Rosetta(DE3)/pTrap-T7 expression system trypsinogen is produced in a denatured form as inclusion bodies, which are solubilized and renatured in vitro. Details of expression and purification are given under “Experimental Procedures.” Importantly, recombinant mesotrypsinogen preparations purified from the two bacterial expression systems were indistinguishable in their functional properties studied here. Mesotrypsinogen was completely activated by bovine enterokinase, albeit at a slower rate than anionic or cationic trypsinogen (Fig. 1, A and B). Catalytic parameters of activated mesotrypsin were determined with the chromogenic substrate N-CBZ-Gly-Pro-Arg-p-nitroanilide, and mesotrypsin exhibited an ∼3-fold higher turnover number (kcat) with a comparable Km value relative to cationic or anionic trypsin (Table I).Table IKinetic parameters of human trypsins on the synthetic substrate N-CBZ-Gly-Pro-Arg-p-nitroanilide at 22°CKmkcatkcat/Kmμms-1m-1 s-1PRSS115 ± 150 ± 13.3 × 106PRSS211 ± 141 ± 13.7 × 106PRSS322 ± 2148 ± 46.7 × 106R198G10 ± 237 ± 13.7 × 106 Open table in a new tab Inhibitor Resistance of Mesotrypsin Is Caused by Arg198—On the basis of sequence alignments (5.Nyaruhucha C.N.M. Kito M. Fukuoka S.I. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 10573-10578Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar) and a crystal structure (6.Katona G. Berglund G.I. Hajdu J. Gráf L. Szilágyi L. J. Mol. Biol. 2002; 315: 1209-1218Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar), it has been suggested that mesotrypsin is resistant to proteinaceous trypsin inhibitors because of the presence of the Arg198 side chain, which sterically impairs inhibitor binding to the enzyme. However, this notion has never been tested experimentally so far. We have expressed and purified the R198G mesotrypsin mutant, in which the characteristic Gly198 residue, universally found in chymotrypsin-like serine proteases, has been restored. Surprisingly, activation of mesotrypsinogen mutant R198G with enterokinase under physiological conditions (pH 8.0, 1 mm Ca2+, 37 °C) yielded only 20% of the expected activity (Fig. 1A). As shown on the gel in Fig. 1C, the loss of activity was due to massive degradation of the R198G-zymogen during the activation process. When the reaction was performed in the presence of SPINK1, which inhibited trypsin but not enterokinase, R198G-mesotrypsinogen was quantitatively converted to trypsin, indicating that the degradation was mediated by trypsin and not enterokinase (not shown). Activation in the presence of high Ca2+ concentrations (50 mm) at room temperature (22 °C) increased the trypsin yield, and eventually pure and active R198G-mesotrypsin preparation could be obtained by separating the degradation products on a benzamidine affinity column. Catalytic parameters of R198G-mesotrypsin on N-CBZ-Gly-Pro-Arg-p-nitroanilide were essentially identical to those of cationic or anionic trypsin (Table I). Strikingly, R198G-mesotrypsin fully regained its sensitivity to protein trypsin inhibitors, and formed tight inhibitory complexes with SBTI or SPINK1 (Fig. 2). As expected, wild-type mesotrypsin was resistant to these inhibitors. The experiments confirmed that the unique inhibitor resistance of mesotrypsin was the result of a single evolutionary amino acid change, which replaced the small conserved Gly198 residue with a bulky Arg. Notably, in addition to rendering mesotrypsin resistant to inhibitors, the evolutionary selection of the potentially trypsin-sensitive Arg198 side chain also stabilized mesotrypsin(ogen) against autocatalytic degradation. This apparent paradox is resolved if we assume that Arg198 blocks access to the mesotrypsin active site not only for protein inhibitors, but also for protein substrates, and thus renders mesotrypsin relatively inactive toward its own trypsin-sensitive sites. This notion will be further explored by the subsequent experiments in this report. Mesotrypsin Cannot Activate Pancreatic Zymogens—Next, we tested the hypothesis that because of its inhibitor resistance mesotrypsin can activate pancreatic zymogens unopposed by SPINK1, and this mechanism might play a role in the development of human pancreatitis (2.Rinderknecht H. Renner I.G. Abramson S.B. Carmack C. Gastroenterology. 1984; 86: 681-692Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar, 5.Nyaruhucha C.N.M. Kito M. Fukuoka S.I. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 10573-10578Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). This theory was already contradicted by sporadic observations indicating that mesotrypsin was defective in activating bovine chymotrypsinogen (2.Rinderknecht H. Renner I.G. Abramson S.B. Carmack C. Gastroenterology. 1984; 86: 681-692Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar) or human cationic and anionic trypsinogen (16.Szilágyi L. Kénesi E. Katona G. Kaslik G. Juhász G. Gráf L. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 24574-24580Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). As shown in Fig. 3, these previous findings were fully confirmed by our experiments in which mesotrypsin was used to activate human anionic and cationic trypsinogen. Both zymogens autoactivated spontaneously to trypsin as a function of time, and addition of cationic trypsin, anionic trypsin or R198G-mesotrypsin markedly enhanced this process. In contrast, inclusion of mesotrypsin had no appreciable effect on trypsinogen activation, and mesotrypsinogen itself exhibited no autoactivation either. Wild-type mesotrypsin did not activate bovine chymotrypsinogen A, whereas R198G-mesotrypsin was essentially as active as cationic or anionic trypsin. When rates of chymotrypsinogen activation were compared quantitatively, mesotrypsin proved to be 500–1000-fold less efficient than cationic trypsin (not shown). Finally, the activation experiments were extended to human pro-elastase 2 (ELA2A), which was efficiently activated by human cationic trypsin, and even better by R198G-mesotrypsin, but was totally resistant to wild-type mesotrypsin (Fig. 3). Importantly, under the conditions used (pH 8.0, 1 mm Ca2+), mesotrypsin did not degrade any of the zymogens tested to a detectable extent. Taken together, these experiments convincingly rule out a possible role for mesotrypsin in promoting intra-pancreatic zymogen activation. Furthermore, our notion that the presence of Arg198 renders mesotrypsin catalytically impaired toward protein substrates gained clear experimental support. In terms of cleaving the activation peptide bonds of pancreatic zymogens, mesotrypsin appears to be 2–3 orders of magnitude less active than the major trypsin isoforms, and this defect can be fully repaired by the restoration of Gly198. Role of Mesotrypsin in Trypsinogen Degradation—Previous work by Rinderknecht et al. (2.Rinderknecht H. Renner I.G. Abramson S.B. Carmack C. Gastroenterology. 1984; 86: 681-692Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar) indicated that mesotrypsin can degrade bovine trypsinogen and possibly other pancreatic zymogens. This observation spawned the theory, that inappropriate trypsinogen activation in the pancreas is curbed not only by SPINK1, which mops up active trypsin, but also by the SPINK1-resistant mesotrypsin, which eliminates trypsinogen, and thus limits further escalation of the activation cascade (2.Rinderknecht H. Renner I.G. Abramson S.B. Carmack C. Gastroenterology. 1984; 86: 681-692Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar, 5.Nyaruhucha C.N.M. Kito M. Fukuoka S.I. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 10573-10578Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). To test this model, we examined the activity of mesotrypsin on the degradation of human cationic and anionic trypsinogen. For these experiments we used activation-resistant mutant trypsinogens, in which Lys-23 in the activation site was replaced with Gln (K23Q). K23Q-trypsinogen is an ideal model substrate to study trypsinogen degradation without interference from trypsinogen activation (13.Kukor Z. Tóth M. Sahin-Tóth M. Eur. J. Biochem. 2003; 270: 2047-2058Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar, 18.Kukor Z. Tóth M. Pál G. Sahin-Tóth M. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 6111-6117Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). Fig. 4 shows that in the absence of Ca2+ (in 1 mm EDTA, pH 8.0, 37 °C) mesotrypsin slowly cleaved the Arg122–Val123 peptide bond in cationic K23Q-trypsinogen. We demonstrated previously that this peptide bond is the most sensitive trypsinolytic site in cationic trypsinogen (18.Kukor Z. Tóth M. Pál G. Sahin-Tóth M. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 6111-6117Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). In contrast to a widely held belief, cleavage at this site does not result in any further degradation or inactivation, but yields a double-chain trypsin(ogen) species, which is functionally equivalent to its single-chain parent enzyme. Furthermore, cleavage never proceeds to completion, but due to trypsin-mediated re-synthesis of the Arg122–Val123 peptide bond an equilibrium is established between the single-chain and the double-chain species. Mesotrypsin-mediated digestion of the Arg122–Val123 peptide bond in 1 mm EDTA resulted in the expected hydrolysis equilibrium with ∼18% single chain and 82% double chain trypsinogen present (Fig. 4, A and C). Addition of 1 mm Ca2+ significantly decreased the rate of cleavage, and at 240 min only 20% double chain trypsinogen was observed (Fig. 4, B and C). This was not a true equilibrium yet, because previous studies indicated that in the presence of Ca2+ the equilibrium mixture should contain 40% double chain and 60% single chain trypsinogen (18.Kukor Z. Tóth M. Pál G. Sahin-Tóth M. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 6111-6117Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). The results clearly demonstrate that mesotrypsin is capable of cleaving the Arg122–Val123 peptide bond. However, comparison of mesotrypsin (Fig. 4) and cationic trypsin (cf. Fig. 4 in Ref. 18.Kukor Z. Tóth M. Pál G. Sahin-Tóth M. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 6111-6117Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar) in their ability to cleave cationic K23Q-trypsinogen revealed that mesotrypsin was at least 500-fold less active. Other than cleaving at Arg122–Val123, mesotrypsin did not"

The Escherichia coli SurA protein is a periplasmic molecular chaperone that participates in the folding and assembly of outer membrane porins (1.Lazar S.W. Kolter R. J. Bacteriol. 1996; 178: 1770-1773Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 2.Missiakas D. Betton J.M. Raina S. Mol. Microbiol. 1996; 21: 871-884Crossref PubMed Scopus (294) Google Scholar, 3.Rouvière P.E.

Bacteriol. 1990; 172: 4339-4347Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Although a null mutation in surA is not by itself lethal, simultaneous null mutations in surA and the homologous ppiD gene are lethal (5.Dartigalongue C. Raina S. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 3968-3980Crossref PubMed Scopus (192) Google Scholar) arguing that an activity of the SurA protein is both essential and encoded redundantly. The surA sequence delineates four separate domains following the leader sequence: an amino-terminal domain of ∼150 amino acids, followed by two peptidyl-prolyl isomerase domains of ∼100 residues each (PPIase 1The abbreviations used are: PPIasepeptidyl-prolyl isomeraseAraromaticELISAenzyme-linked immunosorbent assayITCisothermal titration calorimetrypfuplaque-forming units. P1 and P2) that are homologous to the PPIase parvulin (6.Rahfeld J.U. Rucknagel K.P. Schelbert B. Ludwig B. Hacker J. Mann K. Fischer G. FEBS Lett. 1994; 352: 180-184Crossref PubMed Scopus (174) Google Scholar), and finally, a carboxyl-terminal domain of ∼40 amino acids. Although SurA was initially designated a PPIase because of the presence of two parvulin-like domains (3.Rouvière P.E. Gross C.A. Genes Dev. 1996; 10: 3170-3182Crossref PubMed Scopus (252) Google Scholar), it has been shown that the P1 and P2 domains can be deleted without loss of in vivo function, whereas both the N and C domains are required (7.Behrens S. Maier R. de Cock H. Schmid F.X. Gross C.A. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 285-294Crossref PubMed Scopus (192) Google Scholar). Additionally, it has been shown that in vitro, both SurA and an amino-terminal fragment thereof (residues 21-133) bind a peptide derived from somatostatin (sequence AGSKNFFWKTFTSS) that is devoid of proline residues, giving an example where the PPIase domains are not required in the SurA protein, and proline is not required in the target peptide for peptide binding (8.Webb H.M.

The x-ray crystallographic structure of SurA reveals a protein with a core module constituted of the N, P1, and C domains, and a satellite P2 domain tethered to and ∼30 Å distant from, the core module (9.Bitto E. McKay D.B. Structure. 2002; 10: 1489-1498Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar). The core module has an extended crevice ∼50 Å in length that could readily accommodate polypeptides. In the SurA crystals, a segment of peptide from one molecule is bound in the crevice of a neighbor molecule. Models for the molecular chaperone activity of SurA envisage binding of porin polypeptide segments; the crevice of the core module is an attractive candidate for the putative peptide binding activity. As one approach to characterizing a peptide binding activity of SurA, we have used phage display to select short peptides that bind with significant affinity (10.Parmley S.F. Smith G.P. Gene. 1988; 73: 305-318Crossref PubMed Scopus (738) Google Scholar, 11.Smith G.P. Scott J.K. Meth. Enzymol. 1993; 217: 228-257Crossref PubMed Scopus (699) Google Scholar). We find that both full-length SurA and its core module have similar peptide binding specificities and affinities for peptides with a consensus sequence of the form aromatic-polar-aromatic-nonpolar-proline (Ar-polar-Ar-nonpolar-Pro). Ar-X-Ar tripeptide motifs (where X can be any residue) are found with high frequency in the sequences of outer membrane proteins, where they typically localize to the aromatic bands in the structures of the proteins. The data we present here suggest that SurA recognizes peptides that would be characteristic of outer membrane proteins consistent with its proposed role in facilitating the correct folding and assembly of these proteins. Protein Expression and Purification—Mature E. coli SurA protein (amino acids 21-421; SwissProt P21202) was expressed as a fusion with a self-cleaving intein and purified as described in Ref. 9.Bitto E. McKay D.B. Structure. 2002; 10: 1489-1498Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar. An expression vector for a SurA deletion lacking the second P2 parvulin-like domain (SurA(ΔP2), residues 21-281 and 390-428) was created using the overlap-extension methodology (12.Ho S.N. Hunt H.D. Horton R.M. Pullen J.K. Pease L.R. Gene. 1989; 77: 51-99Crossref PubMed Scopus (6850) Google Scholar). In the first stage of PCR amplification, the coding sequence for the amino-terminal fragment of the deletion construct, residues 21-281, was amplified from the expression plasmid for full-length SurA using primers A (5′-AATTAACATATGGCCCCCCAGGTAGTCG-3′) (NdeI site in bold) and B (5′-ACGATCTTTCTGCGCAGCGTCCGAGATATTTTTGCTTTCGCC-3′). Similarly, the coding sequence for residues 390-428 was amplified using primer C (5′-GACGCTGCGCAGAAAGATCGTGCATACCGC-3′) (complementary overlap between primers B and C is underlined) and primer D (5′-AACATTGGTACCCTTGGCAAAGC-3′) (KpnI site in bold). The PCR fragments from the first stage were used in a second PCR amplification along with primers A and D to produce the coding sequence for the deletion construct, which was then cloned into the pTYB1 intein-fusion expression vector (IMPACT system; New England Biolabs) using the NdeI and KpnI restriction sites. The SurA(ΔP2) protein was expressed as an intein fusion and purified following the protocol used previously for the SurA protein (9.Bitto E. McKay D.B. Structure. 2002; 10: 1489-1498Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar). Phage Display—Three rounds of phage display selection were performed independently for both mature SurA and SurA(ΔP2) protein using a heptapeptide-presenting phage library (library Ph.D.-7 from New England BioLabs) following essentially the manufacturer's protocol. Briefly, 1.5 ml of a 100 μg/ml protein solution in 100 mm NaHCO3, pH 8.6, was added to a 60-mm Petri dish. The target protein was allowed to coat the Petri dish surface overnight in a closed humidified container at 4 °C. Unbound protein was discarded, and the surface of the dish was blocked with blocking buffer (100 mm NaHCO3, 5 mg/ml bovine serum albumin, pH 8.6) for 1 h at 4 °C. After this period, the dish was washed six times with TBST buffer (50 mm Tris/HCl, 150 mm NaCl, 0.1% (v/v) Tween 20, pH 7.5). Immediately after the wash step, 2 × 1011 pfu (from the phage library) pre-diluted in 1 ml of TBST buffer were poured on the dish and rocked on a rotary shaker for 30 min at 25 °C. Unbound phage remaining in the solution was discarded, and the dish was washed 10 times with TBST buffer. To elute the bound phage, 1 ml of 100 μg/ml SurA or SurA(ΔP2) was added and rocked on a rotary shaker for 60 min at 25 °C. Eluted phage was amplified in E. coli ER2738, and titer was established using standard phage biology protocols. A second and third round of selection were performed using the same protocol as the first round, except for two variations: (a) Tween 20 concentration in the TBST buffer was increased to 0.5% (v/v) to achieve more stringent selection, and (b) the phage elution period was shortened from 60 min to 30 min. After the third round of selection, aliquots of the phage solutions were plated on LB/IPTG/Xgal (IPTG, isopropyl-β-d-thiogalactopyranoside; Xgal, 5-bromo-4-chloro-3-indolyl β-d-galactopyranoside) plates. Ten plaques were selected and purified; single-strand DNA was isolated from phage derived from each plaque and sequenced in the region encoding the heptamer peptide. Affinity Evaluation of Selected Clones by ELISA—The wells of 96-well ELISA plates were coated overnight at 4 °C in a humidified closed container with 100 μl/well of 100 μg/ml SurA or SurA(ΔP2) protein in 100 mm NaHCO3, pH 8.6. As a control to identify plastic-binding phage, protein was omitted from some wells in parallel. The following day, protein solutions were discarded and wells were blocked for 2 h at 4 °C with blocking buffer (100 mm NaHCO3, 5 mg/ml bovine serum albumin, pH 8.6). The ELISA plates were then washed six times with TBST buffer. Phage dilutions were made in a separate plate that had been treated with blocking buffer; the first well contained 1011 pfu/200 μl of TBST, and ten sequential 4-fold dilutions were made resulting in a range of 105-1011 pfu/200 μl. Diluted phage solutions were transferred into ELISA plates coated with the target protein and incubated 1 h at room temperature with agitation. Wells were washed 6 times with TBST, after which 200 μl of horseradish peroxidase-conjugated anti-M13 antibody (Amersham Biosciences catalog number 27-9411-01) diluted 1:5000 times in blocking buffer was pipetted into the ELISA plate wells. After 1 h of incubation at room temperature, the antibody solution was discarded and the plate was washed six times in TBST. Finally, 200 μl of freshly prepared horseradish peroxidase substrate (36 μl of 30% H2O2 added to 21 ml of ABTS stock (22 mg of 2,2′-azino-bis(3-ethylbenzthiazoline)-6-sulfonic acid in 100 ml of 50 mm sodium citrate, pH 4.0)) was added to the ELISA plate wells, and the reaction was allowed to proceed for ∼15 min at room temperature. Product of the horseradish peroxidase reaction was monitored as optical absorbance at λ = 410 nm with a microplate reader. Isothermal Titration Calorimetry—A heptapeptide of sequence WEYIPNV was synthesized and purified by high pressure liquid chromatography by the Stanford Protein and Nucleic Acid facility. A peptide of sequence YYY was purchased from Sigma. Peptides of sequence DNRDGNVYYF and DNRDGNVYQF were a generous gift from Dr. Robert Sauer (Massachusetts Institute of Technology). Protein and peptide concentrations were determined by spectrophotometer in 6 m guanidine hydrochloride, 20 mm NaH2PO4, pH 6.5, using calculated molar extinction coefficients ϵ276 = 28,850 m-1 cm-1 for SurA, 23,450 for SurA(ΔP2), 6,850 for WEYIPNV, 2900 for DNRDGNVYYF, 1450 for DNRDGNVYQF, and 4350 for YYY (13.Gill S.C. von Hippel P.H. Anal. Biochem. 1989; 182: 319-326Crossref PubMed Scopus (5070) Google Scholar). Solutions of SurA or SurA(ΔP2) at 36-160 μm protein concentration in 150 mm NaCl, 20 mm NaH2PO4, pH in the range of 4.8-9.5, were placed in a 1.4-ml sample cell for a model VP-ITC MicroCalorimeter (MicroCal, Inc.). The peptide WEYIPNV was dissolved in the same buffer as the protein at 1.5-2 mm concentration and placed into a 250 μm injection syringe. The system was allowed to equilibrate to the desired experimental temperature in the range of 20-37 °C. In accordance with recommended procedures from the manufacturer, a single initial injection of 1-2 μl of peptide solution was made into the sample cell followed by 240 s of equilibration. This data point was not included in the analysis. The initial injection was followed by 24-36 injections of 6-10 μl of volume at a rate of 2 μl/s with equilibration intervals of 300-420 s between injections. The cell contents were stirred continuously during the experiment at 310 rpm. A control experiment to evaluate the heat contribution from peptide dilution was performed at 30 °C using identical injections of peptide solution into the buffer in the absence of protein. The heat contribution was found to be minimal (∼0.1% of the experimental signal) and was not corrected for during the analysis. The experimental data were fit with programs supplied by the manufacturer to a model with one binding site parameterized by the equation,Q=nMtΔHV02[1+XtnMt+1nKaMt-(1+XtnMt+1nKaMt)2-4XtnMt](Eq. 1) where Q = total heat content of solution, n = number of sites, Mt is the total (bound + free) concentration of macromolecule, Xt is the total concentration of ligand, ΔH is enthalpy change, and Ka is the association constant; all parameters are in volume (V0) to obtain apparent binding stoichiometry n, association constant Ka, and ΔH values. From these parameters and the equations ΔG = RT ln(Ka) and ΔG = ΔH - TΔS, we computed ΔG and ΔS. ITC experiments with other peptides were attempted using similar buffer conditions (150 mm NaCl, 20 mm NaH2PO4, pH 7.3, T = 30 °C) and generally higher protein concentrations: for DNRDGNVYYF, 1.95 mm peptide and 282 μm SurA(ΔP2); for DNRDGNVYQF, 1.5 mm peptide and 106 μm SurA(ΔP2); for YYY, 3.86 mm peptide and 250 μm SurA. Computational Sequence Analysis—For proteome analysis, the predicted open reading frames of the E. coli K12 genome were used. 2GenBank™ release March 7, 2003, NC_000913.gbk available at ftp.ncbi.nih.gov. The annotations available at the E. coli Cell Envelope Protein Data Collection (ECCE; www.cf.ac.uk/biosi/staff/ehrmann/tools/ecce/ecce.htm) were used to identify the inner membrane, and periplasmic and outer membrane proteins; the remaining proteins were designated to be cytoplasmic. After correcting for duplication resulting from alternative names used for some proteins, the data set consisted of 74 outer membrane, 129 periplasmic, 593 inner membrane, and 3,482 cytoplasmic proteins. The normalized occurrence of the Ar-X-Ar motif per hundred amino acids (where Ar represents Trp, Tyr, or Phe and X is any amino acid) was computed as (number of occurrences) × 100/(protein length) for each protein. For each protein set, the normalized rate of occurrence of the Ar-X-Ar motif was computed as the arithmetic average for all proteins in the set. The frequency of occurrence of individual amino acids (freq(X)) was computed as the total number of occurrences in all proteins of that set divided by the total number of amino acid residues in the set. The expected frequency of a random occurrence of the Ar-X-Ar motif within a polypeptide of 100-residue length was computed from the frequencies of occurrence of individual amino acids as 98 × (freq(Trp) + freq(Tyr) + freq(Phe))2 for each protein set (outer membrane, periplasmic, inner membrane, and cytoplasmic). To characterize a peptide binding activity of SurA, we have screened a phage display library carrying a heptapeptide tag of random sequence at the amino terminus of the minor coat protein of the M13 phage. The starting phage library has a complexity of ∼2.8 × 109 transformants (New England Biolabs), which can be compared with ∼1.3 × 109 different sequences that are possible for a heptapeptide so that the initial library included essentially all possible 7-mer amino acid sequences. The bipartite structure of the SurA protein (in which the second PPIase domain, P2, is a satellite of the core structure of the molecule) suggests a partitioning of activities between the core module (which includes domains N, P1, and C) and the P2 domain. Further, an extended crevice within the core module is suggestive of a peptide binding capability that may be related to the molecular chaperone activity of SurA (9.Bitto E. McKay D.B. Structure. 2002; 10: 1489-1498Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar). In this context, we have made a construct in which the peripheral PPIase domain is deleted (SurA(ΔP2)) and have characterized its peptide binding activity in parallel with that of SurA. Although we do not report the structure of the SurA(ΔP2) protein here, we have crystallized it, collected data to 3.5 Å on one crystal form, and determined a solution for the structure by molecular replacement, attesting to the structural integrity of the protein from which the P2 domain has been deleted. Peptides Selected by Phage Display—Three cycles of phage display selection were carried out independently with both SurA and SurA(ΔP2) proteins each as the affinity targets. After the third cycle, ten plaques from each selection were chosen randomly and purified, and the DNA sequence encoding the heptapeptide tag of each phage was determined. (One phage stock selected on SurA(ΔP2) gave an ambiguous sequence; because a clear consensus emerged from among the other nine, it was not pursued further). The derived amino acid sequences of the displayed peptides are shown in Table I.Table ISequences of peptides selected by phage display Aromatic and proline residues that contribute to an apparent consensus are underlined.

Phage binding was detected with a chromogenic horseradish peroxidase reaction from bound horseradish peroxidase-conjugated anti-M13 antibody. Serial dilutions of phage spanning a range of 106 plaque-forming units (pfu) were used. Control experiments (in which SurA and SurA(ΔP2) proteins were omitted) were done to identify phage with an artifactually high affinity for the ELISA plate wells (plastic binders). Results of the ELISA experiments are shown in Fig. 1 and included in Table I. For both SurA and SurA(ΔP2), the majority of the peptides cluster in a similar affinity versus phage profile with a midpoint in the range of 108-109 pfu. Three peptides were identified as having 2-3 orders of magnitude lower relative affinity than the majority of peptides; they are denoted as ”low” relative affinity in Table I. One peptide (of sequence WEYIPNV) showed significantly higher affinity than others for SurA in ELISA assays; for SurA(ΔP2), another peptide sequence (WTYIPPV) also had a higher than typical affinity (Fig. 1). One peptide (with sequence FPCFFCY) was initially suspected to be a plastic binder because of its high content of aromatic residues and was found to have a significant affinity for the ELISA plate wells at high phage concentration. However, separate measurements of its affinity versus phage profile revealed that it also has a high affinity for SurA at a low phage concentration. A pattern emerges from the majority of the high affinity peptide sequences. First, it is notable that in independent experiments similar sequences were selected by SurA and SurA(ΔP2); as a case in point, one identical peptide sequence (WTYIPPV) emerged in both selections from a library of ∼1.3 × 109 independent sequences. It is also notable that the ELISA profiles are similar for both SurA and SurA(ΔP2); this supports a suggestion that the core domain of SurA is largely, if not wholly, responsible for the peptide binding we are observing. Finally, a consensus pattern that emerges is Ar-polar-Arnonpolar-Pro. Among the modest number of individual phage plaques that were sequenced, this consensus occurs more frequently for SurA(ΔP2) protein (7 of 9 plaques) than for SurA (6 of 10). One deviation from this consensus that still has high affinity is the sequence FDFNRRI selected by SurA(ΔP2), which lacks the hydrophobic and proline residues; however, it retains the Ar-polar-Ar motif. The question this raises is whether the first three residues might constitute a minimal recognition sequence for binding. A second variant is the sequence FPCFFCY, which also has high affinity. It has four aromatic residues and an Ar-polar-Ar motif in the final positions rather than the initial positions, suggesting a general preference for aromatic rich peptides by SurA. A third variant from this consensus is the peptide PLPISPR selected by SurA; this peptide has an unusually high proline content (3/7). It is unclear why this peptide would have an affinity similar to those fitting the consensus pattern; we cannot rule out the possibility that it is binding at a different site or in a different manner than the other peptides. Isothermal Titration Calorimetry—To quantify the peptide binding affinity, we have synthesized the peptide displaying high affinity in ELISA (WEYIPNV) and have carried out ITC experiments with it. A typical calorimetric titration is shown in Fig. 2A. The data on heat enthalpy change versus molar ratio of peptide to protein have been fit with a theoretical curve that models a single set of identical peptide binding sites on the protein; a typical fit is shown in Fig. 2B. Because this model fit the data well, models with greater complexity were not utilized. Values of the parameter representing the number of peptide molecules bound per protein molecule ranged from 0.86 to 0.88 for SurA and from 1.04 to 1.41 for SurA(ΔP2); we interpret these numbers to indicate a single peptide binding site per protein. The parameters derived from the ITC titrations are summarized in Table II. We observed modest variation between values of parameters determined under identical conditions for protein from different preps (batches); for example, three different measurements of peptide binding to SurA(ΔP2) at 30 °C, pH 7.3, gave values for the dissociation constant Kd of 3.95 ± 0.12, 4.15 ± 0.10, and 3.66 ± 0.22 μm. By contrast, independent measurements under identical conditions on the same batch of protein typically agreed to three significant figures in values for fitted parameters. Consequently, the dependence of binding parameters on temperature, pH, and salt concentration were all measured on the same batch of protein.Table IISummary of thermodynamic parameters for the interaction of WEYIPNV peptide with SurA and/or SurA (ΔP2)Experimental conditionsBest fit parametersCalculated parametersTargetTpHnKaΔH0ΔG0TΔS0ΔS0Kd°Cm-1kcal/molkcal/molkcal/molkcal·mol-1·K-1μmSurA207.30.859 ± 0.002434,300 ± 9,371-19.90 ± 0.05-7.57-12.33-42.062.30 ± 0.05257.30.875 ± 0.002279,500 ± 6,430-19.41 ± 0.06-7.44-11.97-40.163.58 ± 0.08307.30.869 ± 0.02196,100 ± 4,472-18.49 ± 0.07-7.35-11.14-36.755.10 ± 0.12377.30.86 ± 0.0691,890 ± 3,447-16.11 ± 0.18-7.05-9.06-41.9710.9 ± 0.4SurA(ΔP2)207.31.036 ± 0.011590,500 ± 53,540-20.89 ± 0.28-7.75-13.14-44.831.69 ± 0.15257.31.170 ± 0.004448,600 ± 14,700-20.16 ± 0.10-7.72-12.44-41.732.23 ± 0.07307.31.256 ± 0.006253,200 ± 8,004-19.36 ± 0.12-7.50-11.86-39.123.95 ± 0.12377.31.321 ± 0.01672,510 ± 4,153-19.92 ± 0.34-6.90-13.02-41.9713.8 ± 0.8SurA(ΔP2)307.31.241 ± 0.002241,000 ± 5,735-20.88 ± 0.05-7.47-13.41-44.234.15 ± 0.10377.31.295 ± 0.003118,600 ± 2,373-20.82 ± 0.06-7.21-13.61-43.898.43 ± 0.17SurA(ΔP2)304.81.414 ± 0.008476,100 ± 40,390-16.57 ± 0.14-7.88-8.69-28.662.10 ± 0.18306.01.288 ± 0.002311,000 ± 6,443-19.88 ± 0.04-7.63-12.25-40.423.22 ± 0.07307.31.218 ± 0.005272,800 ± 16,160-19.80 ± 0.11-7.55-12.25-40.423.66 ± 0.22308.31.266 ± 0.003123,600 ± 2,132-22.17 ± 0.06-7.07-15.10-49.818.09 ± 0.14309.51.326 ± 0.00260,170 ± 640-20.82 ± 0.05-6.64-14.18-46.7916.6 ± 0.2SurA(ΔP2)aMeasurement performed in 1 m NaCl, 20 mm sodium phosphate, pH 7.3307.31.175 ± 0.001271,200 ± 3,348-21.50 ± 0.03-7.54-13.96-46.043.69 ± 0.05307.31.177 ± 0.002270,900 ± 6,469-21.38 ± 0.06-7.54-13.84-45.643.69 ± 0.09a Measurement performed in 1 m NaCl, 20 mm sodium phosphate, pH 7.3 Open table in a new tab Measurements of the temperature dependence of the binding were made on both SurA and SurA(ΔP2) over the range of 20-37 °C. The Kd values of the peptide for both proteins lie in the range of 1-14 μm over this temperature range. SurA(ΔP2) consistently has a slightly (less than 2-fold) higher affinity than full-length SurA for the peptide. This is consistent with the ELISA data for relative affinities of peptide-tagged phage particles for the two proteins where the binding midpoint occurred at a slightly lower phage concentration for SurA(ΔP2) than for SurA for each of the high affinity peptides (Fig. 1). Both the absolute values of the binding parameters and their dependence on temperature were similar for SurA and SurA(ΔP2). Because the SurA(ΔP2) protein is easier to produce in large quantities and is more well behaved in solution than SurA, a more extensive characterization of the binding was carried out with SurA(ΔP2). We see that the peptide affinity decreases with increasing temperature and increasing pH. It does not show a significant dependence on the ionic strength of the solvent; the peptide affinity in the presence of 1 m NaCl is equal to its affinity in the presence of 0.15 m NaCl. There is a slight decrease in ΔH with increasing temperature, suggesting that a significant component of the peptide-SurA interaction is hydrophobic, which would be expected from the nature of the consensus sequence. Recently it was shown that peptides bearing the carboxyl-terminal Ar-X-Ar motif, which is prevalent in outer membrane porins, activate the periplasmic unfolded protein response by binding the DegS protease. In this context, and because the consensus SurA binding sequence derived from phage display experiments bears an amino-terminal Ar-X-Ar motif, we effected ITC experiments on peptides used in the DegS study that have a carboxyl-terminal Ar-X-Ar motif, as well as on a short tripeptide of aromatic residues. ITC with the peptides DNRDGNVYYF and DNRDGNVYQF (Ar-X-Ar motif underlined) gave heat absorption traces that failed to reach saturation under the conditions used (∼100-280 μm SurA(ΔP2)) indicating substantially weaker binding of these peptides compared with the peptide of sequence WEYIPNV. Accurate affinity constants were not determined for these peptides because the calorimetry experiments would have required excessively high protein concentrations to compensate for the low affinities. For comparison, ITC was also carried out with the tripeptide of sequence YYY and 250 μm full-length SurA protein. Again, the heat absorption trace failed to saturate indicating that Kd is significantly greater than 250 μm for this tripeptide. Prevalence of the Ar-X-Ar Motif—A genome-wide analysis of predicted E. coli open reading frames reveals (a) aromatic residues have a higher frequency of occurrence in membrane proteins than in cytoplasmic and periplasmic proteins; in particular, tyrosine is prevalent in outer membrane proteins, whereas phenylalanine and tryptophan are frequent in inner membrane proteins (Table III); (b) the Ar-X-Ar motif has a higher than random occurrence in membrane proteins, occurring almost twice as frequently as in periplasmic and cytoplasmic proteins where its average frequency of appearance is essentially random (Table IV and Fig. 3). The presence of a carboxyl-terminal Ar-X-Ar motif, which has previously been recognized as occurring with high frequency in integral outer membrane proteins, is found in 28% of outer membrane proteins in the E. coli genome. In contrast, it occurs in only 0.5% of inner membrane proteins, it is not found in periplasmic proteins, and it occurs in 33, or ∼1%, of proteins designated to be cytoplasmic (although inspection of the sequences suggests that several of these proteins may actually be outer membrane proteins). Caveats to bear in mind when evaluating these statistics include: (a) the classification of proteins into the different classes is an ongoing process, and it is likely that some of the current annotations are erroneous; and (b) not all proteins assigned to the outer membrane class are integral membrane proteins. Nonetheless, the results are derived from statistics on a large population, and hence the general trends we observe are unlikely to be altered by variances introduced by evolving annotations.Table IIISummary of frequency of occurrence of amino acids in E. coli proteinsAmino acidCombined occurrenceNormalized amino acid occurrenceaThe occurrence of given amino acid in proteins from the E. coli compartment divided by the occurrence of the amino acid in all E. coli proteinsOuter membranePeriplasmInner membraneCytoplasm%%Ala9.488610511199Cys1.17345373109Asp5.1412511864106Glu5.75728564110Phe3.90909113693Gly7.371289911297His2.28666767109Ile6.00768212496Lys4.419214577104Leu10.64758511797Met2.85719412796Asn3.9516812681100Pro4.438311899101Gln4.4311011481103Arg5.54857678106Ser5.8213410310497Thr5.401321109998Val7.069310111697Trp1.5311210512793Tyr2.851661049499a The occurrence of given amino acid in proteins from the E. coli compartment divided by the occurrence of the amino acid in all E. coli proteins Open table in a new tab Table IVFrequency of occurrence of Ar-X-Ar motif in E. coli proteinsAr-X-AraAr represents aromatic amino acids W, Y, or F; X represents any amino acid motif occurrence per 100 amino acidsE. coli compartmentCombinedOuter membranePeriplasmInner membraneCytoplasmObserved0.6931.1270.5811.1340.614ExpectedbCalculated from amino acid frequencies of W, Y, and F in given E. coli compartment0.6710.9690.6450.9660.603a Ar represents aromatic amino acids W, Y, or F; X represents any amino acidb Calculated from amino acid frequencies of W, Y, and F in given E. coli compartment Open table in a new tab Screening with a phage display peptide library is one approach for characterizing a peptide binding activity of SurA. Using this approach, we have found a significant binding preference for peptides fitting the consensus pattern Ar-polar-Arnonpolar-Pro. This preference emerges in independent phage selection experiments with both SurA and SurA(ΔP2). ITC with one representative heptapeptide, WEYIPNV, shows the affinity to be ∼1-14 μm under conditions relevant to E. coli physiology (T,20-37 °C); SurA(ΔP2) has a slightly higher affinity for the peptide than full-length SurA protein. These data demonstrate that the peptides bind the core domain SurA(ΔP2); the peripheral PPIase domain P2 has little apparent effect on the peptide selectivity. Generally consistent with this scheme are earlier observations showing that SurA and an amino-terminal fragment of SurA bind the peptide AGSKNFFWKTFTSS, which has an internal Ar-X-Ar motif (underlined), and which does not have proline (8.Webb H.M. Ruddock L.W. Marchant R.J. Jonas K. Klappa P. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 45622-45627Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). Sequences of bacterial outer membrane protein have a high occurrence of tripeptides with an Ar-X-Ar pattern; structures of bacterial porins and other outer membrane proteins reveal a rationale for this. The known structures are antiparallel β barrels that have aromatic bands encircling the exterior surface of the molecule at levels corresponding to the extremities of the hydrophobic interior of the lipid bilayer (14.Schirmer T. J. Struct. Biol. 1998; 121: 101-109Crossref PubMed Scopus (210) Google Scholar, 15.Schulz G.E. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2002; 1565: 308-317Crossref PubMed Scopus (380) Google Scholar). The motif Ar-X-Ar occurring within the aromatic band can place two aromatic side chains on the outer face of the β sheet. For example, the E. coli OmpF protein sequence has eight Ar-X-Ar motifs, all of which occur in the aromatic bands of the structure (and in seven of which the amino acid X is polar, either Asp, Asn, Glu, or Gln, consistent with a more restrictive consensus motif suggested by the phage display results in which the second residue is polar). This suggests that SurA is selecting for a peptide motif that is prevalent in, and to a large extent diagnostic of, outer membrane protein sequences. In early work, Struyve et al. (16.Struyve M. Moons M. Tommassen J. J. Mol. Biol. 1991; 218: 141-148Crossref PubMed Scopus (401) Google Scholar) showed that a carboxyl-terminal phenylalanine is essential for the correct assembly of the E. coli PhoE porin in the outer membrane and further that a carboxyl-terminal Ar-X-Ar motif (where X can be any amino acid) is common among outer membrane proteins of Gram-negative bacteria. More recently, it has been shown that peptides mimicking outer membrane proteins through a carboxyl-terminal YQF or YYF sequence activate the periplasmic DegS protease in vitro through specific binding to its PDZ domain (17.Walsh N. Alba B. Bose B. Gross C. Sauer R. Cell. 2003; 113: 61-71Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (407) Google Scholar). By implication, exposed carboxyl-terminal YXF motifs of outer membrane proteins, by activating DegS in vivo, would initiate the proteolytic cascade that induces the periplasmic unfolded protein response in E. coli. The peptide affinities for the DegS PDZ domain are 0.6 and 15 μm for model peptides ending in YYF and YQF respectively; the latter value is similar to the affinity of the peptide WEYIPNV for SurA. However, somewhat surprisingly, the peptides that terminate in YYF and YQF used in the DegS study do not bind with similar affinity to SurA nor does the control tripeptide of sequence YYY; their affinities are at least an order of magnitude weaker than that of the peptide WEYIPNV. These data imply that SurA does not compete directly with DegS for binding of carboxyl-terminal Ar-X-Ar motifs in outer membrane proteins and that SurA is not a direct negative regulator of the periplasmic unfolded protein response. The data also suggest that there are features in the heptameric peptides selected by phage display in addition to the Ar-X-Ar motif that contribute to affinity for SurA. The emergence of proline at position five of the consensus peptide sequence argues that the minimum length of the peptide bound by SurA is at least five residues and that binding is optimal with proline at that position. An attractive candidate for a proline binding site that is consistent with this observation is the P1 prolyl isomerase domain of the core module. The SurA(ΔP2) core module has a deep extended channel, described previously (9.Bitto E. McKay D.B. Structure. 2002; 10: 1489-1498Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar), which is a candidate site for peptide binding (Fig. 4). However, neither inspection of the surface of the channel nor examination of the intermolecular crystal contacts formed by a segment of peptide that binds in the channel (9.Bitto E. McKay D.B. Structure. 2002; 10: 1489-1498Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar) suggests specific unambiguous docking interactions through which the residues of the WEYIPNV peptide may bind SurA; the structural details of the peptide binding remain an unsolved problem. Although sequences of the form Ar-X-Ar are common in outer membrane porins, sequences fitting the pentapeptide motif Ar-X-Ar-X-Pro are rare. This is likely to reflect the divergence between the peptide binding revealed by phage display experiments, which select for the tightest binding affinity, and in vivo peptide binding, where relatively labile interactions are presumably preferable to high affinity interactions for molecular chaperone activity that requires binding and timely release of segments of peptide by SurA. A remaining question is, what is the functional role of the satellite P2 domain? Its presence has minimal influence on the peptide binding specificity and affinity; the spatial separation of the P2 domain and core module are suggestive of two separate activities for SurA, only one of which (the peptide binding activity of the core module) is revealed in the phage display experiments. SurA is proposed to facilitate the folding of individual porin protomers prior to their assembly into stable trimers. In this context, one folding mechanism that can be suggested is one in which the core module sequesters segments of polypeptide, whereas the P2 domain catalyzes peptide backbone isomerization at sites remote from the sequestered site during the folding process.

One of the COX-independent mechanisms of action of sulindac and its metabolites is to act as ligands for peroxisome proliferator-activated receptors (PPARs). PPARs are nuclear hormone receptors that bind to sequence-specific DNA response elements known as PPREs as a heterodimer with RXRα and can regulate gene expression. There are three PPAR isotypes, α, γ, and δ, present in humans. There is evidence that arachidonic acid metabolites like 15-deoxy-Δ12,14-PGJ2 can serve as activating ligands for PPARs (17Forman B.M.

NSAIDs, like piroxicam, aspirin, and indomethacin, have been shown to exert their chemopreventive action by affecting the polyamine metabolism in colorectal cancer (25Turchanowa L. Dauletbaev N.

The polyamines putrescine, spermidine, and spermine are abundant polycations in eukaryotic cells that are often elevated in neoplastic cells when compared with normal cells and tissues (28Pegg A.E. Cancer Res. 1988; 48: 759-774PubMed Google Scholar). The polyamine levels are tightly regulated by the biosynthetic enzyme ornithine decarboxylase (ODC) and the catabolic enzyme spermidine/spermine N1-acetyltransferase (SSAT) in cells. High levels of polyamines lead to rapid proliferation (29Meyskens Jr., F.L. Gerner E.W. J. Cell Biochem. Suppl. 1995; 22: 126-131Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar), while lower levels of polyamines have been shown to promote apoptosis (30Scorcioni F. Corti A. Davalli P. Astancolle S.

The effects of one of the NSAIDs, indomethacin, on polyamine metabolism involve suppression of ODC and induction of SSAT, thereby decreasing polyamine pools in colon cancer cells (25Turchanowa L. Dauletbaev N. Milovic V. Stein J. Eur. J. Clin. Investig. 2001; 31: 887-893Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). However, it is not known how NSAIDs induce SSAT nor has a role for polyamines in NSAID actions, such as induction of apoptosis, been investigated. In this study, we investigated the effects of sulindac sulfone on SSAT and polyamine metabolism and asked whether polyamines were involved in sulindac sulfone-induced apoptosis of colon cancer cells. All cell culture reagents, DNA-modifying enzymes, TRIzol® reagent (Total RNA Isolation reagent), and LipofectAMINE reagent were purchased from Invitrogen. Ciglitazone and Wy-14643 were purchased from Biomol Research Laboratories. GW9662 and cPGI was purchased from Cayman Chemical. Sulindac sulfone was purchased from ICN Biomedicals, Inc. The anti-PPAR antibody PA3-820 was purchased from Affinity Bioreagents, Inc. Verapamil was purchased from Sigma. Expression plasmids pSG5-xPPARγ, pSG5-xPPARδ, and pSG5-xPPARα were generously given by Dr. Liliane Michalik (Institute de Biologie Animale, Lausanne, Switzerland). The expression plasmid pCMX-hRXRαKpn was kindly provided by Dr. Ronald Evans (The Salk Institute for Biological Studies, La Jolla, CA). Full-SSAT-luc, having a 3.493-kb-long 5′-flanking sequence of the human SSAT gene was cloned into a promoterless pGL2-basic vector (Promega, Madison, WI) as previously reported (39Xiao L. Celano P. Mank A.R. Griffin C. Jabs E.W. Hawkins A.L. Casero Jr., R.A. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1992; 187: 1493-1502Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). 197-SSAT-luc, having 283 nucleotides of the 5′-flanking region of SSAT promoter, was made from Full-SSAT-luc using polymerase chain reaction and subcloned into pGL2-basic vector. PPRE3-tk-Luc reporter construct, having three tandem repeats of PPRE 5′ to the luciferase gene, was a gift from Dr. Ronald Evans. 48ppre-SSAT-luc was made by cloning 100 nucleotides of the 5′-flanking region of SSAT promoter into pGL2-basic vector. Δ48ppre-SSAT-luc has the PPRE at +48 replaced by a random sequence from the SSAT 5′ promoter region, which has no putative transcription factor binding sites as determined by TRANSFAC data base analysis. The Caco-2 cell line was purchased from American Type Culture Collection (ATCC) (Manassas, VA) at passage 12 and was maintained in minimum essential α-medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum and 1% penicillin/streptomycin solution. The human colon cancer cell line HCT-116 was maintained as a monolayer culture in McCoy's 5A medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum plus 1% penicillin/streptomycin solution. Cultures were maintained at 37 °C in a humidified atmosphere of 5% CO2. All cell culture supplies were from Invitrogen. Transient transfections were performed using LipofectAMINE reagent according to the manufacturer's protocol. Briefly, 5 × 105 cells were seeded in a 6-well plate and cultured in normal medium for 24 h. Each well was transfected with 1 μg of firefly luciferase reporter construct along with 0.2 μg of pCMV-β-galactosidase expression plasmid, which acted as a transfection efficiency control. After 6 h of incubation with LipofectAMINE-DNA complex, cells were supplemented with complete medium having 20% fetal bovine serum and 2% penicillin/streptomycin solution and grown overnight. Afterward the medium was removed, and cells were refed with medium along with various concentrations of sulindac sulfone or its vehicle, dimethyl sulfoxide (Me2SO), for 48 h. For PPAR studies, triple transient transfections were performed using the same protocol as above. Each well was transfected with 1 μg of firefly luciferase reporter construct with or without 0.5 μg of expression plasmid for xPPARγ, xPPARδ, or xPPARα and hRXRα. 0.2 μg of pCMV-β-galactosidase expression plasmid was cotransfected into each well for transfection efficiency. After 6 h of incubation with LipofectAMINE-DNA complex, cells were supplemented with complete medium having 20% fetal bovine serum and 2% penicillin/streptomycin solution and grown overnight. On the following day, the medium was removed, and cells were refed with medium along with the appropriate PPAR activator or its vehicle, Me2SO, for 48 h. All transfections were performed in triplicates unless stated differently. All transfected cells were washed once with phosphate-buffered saline and lysed, and luciferase activities were measured using 10 μl of cell extract and 50 μl of luciferase reagent (Promega). β-Galactosidase activity was measured using the β-galactosidase assay kit (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's protocol. Probe Preparation—The microarray chip was made as described in detail before (40Watts G.S. Futscher B.W. Isett R. Gleason-Guzman M. Kunkel M.W. Salmon S.E. J. Pharmacol. Exp. Ther. 2001; 299: 434-441PubMed Google Scholar). The chip has ∼5,300 human genes; >3,000 are known genes, and the remainder are expressed sequence tags as determined by UniGene. A list of the clones on the arrays is available upon request. Target Preparation—Microarray analysis was done as described before (41Crowley-Weber C.L. Payne C.M. Gleason-Guzman M. Watts G.S. Futscher B. Waltmire C.N. Crowley C. Dvorakova K. Bernstein C. Craven M. Garewal H. Bernstein H. Carcinogenesis. 2002; 23: 2063-2080Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). In short, the RNeasy total RNA kit (Qiagen, Valencia, CA) and protocol was used to isolate total RNA from the Caco-2 cells treated with either vehicle or sulindac sulfone. Fluorescent first strand cDNA was made using the Micromax Direct cDNA microarray system (PerkinElmer Life Sciences) following the manufacturer's protocols. cDNA from sulindac sulfone-treated cells were Cy5 (Amersham Biosciences)-labeled, while vehicle-treated cells were Cy3 (Amersham Biosciences)-labeled. Labeled cDNA from two reactions (one Cy3-labeled and one Cy5-labeled) was combined and purified on a Microcon-50 column, lyophilized, resuspended in hybridization buffer (2× SSC, 0.1% SDS, 100 ng/μl Cot1 DNA, 100 ng/μl oligo(dA)), denatured by boiling for 2.5 min, and added to a denatured (2-min boil, slide in double distilled water, plunge into room temperature ethanol, spin dry at 500 × g) microarray. A coverslip (22 × 22 mm) was applied, and the array was placed in a hybridization chamber (catalog number HYB-03, GeneMachines) at 62 °C for 18 h. Following hybridization, slides were washed and then scanned for Cy3 and Cy5 fluorescence using an Axon GenePix 4000 microarray reader (Axon Instruments, Foster City, CA) and quantitated using GenePix software. The analysis was done three independent times with the RNA of sulindac sulfone-treated Caco-2 cells. Total RNA was obtained from cells by extraction using TRIzol reagent and used for Northern blotting as described previously (42Taylor M.T. Lawson K.R. Ignatenko N.A. Marek S.E. Stringer D.E. Skovan B.A. Gerner E.W. Cancer Res. 2000; 60: 6607-6610PubMed Google Scholar, 43Chomczynski P. Sacchi N. Anal. Biochem. 1987; 162: 156-159Crossref PubMed Scopus (62909) Google Scholar). Membranes were hybridized with 32P-labeled cDNA encoding for human SSAT and glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH). Data are expressed as the ratio of the integrated densities of 32P-labeled hybridization bands for the SSAT and GAPDH genes. cDNAs for xPPARα, xPPARγ, xPPARδ, and hRXRα were transcribed and translated in vitro from the pSG5-xPPARα, pSG5-xPPARγ, pSG5-xPPARδ, and pCMX-hRXRαKpn plasmids, respectively. The TnT coupled reticulocyte lysate system (Promega) was used according to the manufacturer's instructions. Translation products were verified by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. Nuclear extracts were prepared from Caco-2 cells essentially as described previously (44Dignam J.D. Lebovitz R.M. Roeder R.G. Nucleic Acids Res. 1983; 11: 1475-1489Crossref PubMed Scopus (9132) Google Scholar). To study the binding of nuclear hormone receptors to the putative PPRE, two double-stranded oligonucleotides, PPRE-2 and PPRE-1, spanning nucleotides +35 to +70 and –304 to –336, respectively, of the SSAT 5′ sequence, were 32P-labeled with polynucleotide kinase (Promega). A 15-μl reaction containing 0.5 ng of PPRE probe and 5 μg of nuclear extract or 0.5–1 μl of in vitro translation reaction was incubated for 20 min at 25 °C and 15 min at 4 °C in a buffer containing 20 mm HEPES (pH 8), 60 mm KCl, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 10% glycerol, and 2 μg of poly(dI-dC). The DNA-protein complexes were resolved from the free probe by electrophoresis at 4 °C on a 5% polyacrylamide gel in 1× Tris borate-EDTA buffer, pH 8. Double-stranded oligonucleotides composed of the following sequences were used for gel shift analysis: PPRE-2 (w), 5′-AGAAAAGAGCAAGGTCACTTGTCGGGGGGCTG-3′; PPRE-1 (w2), 5′-CCGTCACTCGCCGAGGTTCCTTGGGTCATGGTGCC-3′; PPRE-2mut (m), 5′-AGAAAAcAGtAAttgaACTTGgtGGGGGGCTG-3′; PPRE-1mut (m2), 5′-CGTCACTCGtttgGGTgaCGGGTCgTGGTGCC-3′. The PPRE sequence is underlined, and the mutated bases are shown in lowercase letters. Western blots were done for COX-2 as described elsewhere (42Taylor M.T. Lawson K.R. Ignatenko N.A. Marek S.E. Stringer D.E. Skovan B.A. Gerner E.W. Cancer Res. 2000; 60: 6607-6610PubMed Google Scholar). COX-2 antibodies were obtained from Santa Cruz Biotechnology (Santa Cruz, CA) and used at 1:5,000 dilutions, respectively. All Western blots were repeated three times, and a representative blot was chosen for presentation. Caco-2 cells were seeded at a concentration of 1 × 106 cells/100-mm culture plate. The cells were grown for 24 h before they were refed with a new medium and treated with sulindac sulfone, 1 mm putrescine, both, or the vehicle Me2SO. The cells were then harvested after 0, 1, 2, 4, and 6 days postdrug exposure. Cells were removed from the monolayer by treatment with trypsin (∼1,500 units/ml, Calbiochem)-EDTA (0.7 mm) and counted using a hemocytometer. A sample of the cell suspension was combined in a 1:1 volume ratio with trypan blue dye (Invitrogen), and at least two independently prepared suspensions were counted (two counts each) on a hemocytometer. Viability was determined by the percentage of cells able to exclude the trypan blue dye. Caco-2 cells were seeded at a concentration of 1 × 106 cells/100-mm culture plate. Cells were grown for 24 h before they were refed with a new media and treated with sulindac sulfone, 1 mm putrescine, both, or vehicle. The cells were then harvested after 0, 1, 2, 4, and 6 days postdrug exposure. Cells were removed from the monolayer by treatment with trypsin and counted using a hemocytometer. 5 × 105 cells were pelleted down for the apoptosis staining. The procedure for staining with the ApoAlert® Annexin V kit (Clontech) was based on the manufacturer's protocol. Briefly, the cells were resuspended in 200 μlof kit 1× binding buffer. To each tube, 5 μl of the Annexin V/fluorescein isothiocyanate binding buffer (20 μg/ml in Tris-NaCl) and 10 μl of the kit propidium iodide (50 μg/ml in 1× binding buffer) were added. Each tube was gently mixed and incubated for 15 min at room temperature in the dark. The volume was then brought up to 500 μl by adding 1× binding buffer. Cells were analyzed using a BD Biosciences FACScan flow cytometer. For enzyme activities, cells were grown overnight and then treated with various concentrations of sulindac sulfone or its vehicle. Cells were harvested after 48 h of treatment and washed in cold phosphate-buffered saline. The radiochemical assay of the SSAT activity was performed by estimation of labeled N1-acetylspermidine synthesized from [14C]acetyl-CoA and unlabeled spermidine as described elsewhere (45Ignatenko N.A. Gerner E.W. Cell Growth Differ. 1996; 7: 481-486PubMed Google Scholar). The ODC enzyme activity was measured by evaluating the release of 14CO2 from l-[14C]ornithine as described elsewhere (46Fultz K.E. Gerner E.W. Mol. Carcinog. 2002; 34: 10-18Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). The -fold change was calculated by dividing the enzyme activity for the sample by the vehicle. The enzyme assays were done in triplicates. Cell extracts were prepared in 0.1 n HCl (4 × 107 cells/900 μl). After sonication, the preparation was adjusted to 0.2 n HClO4, and the supernatant was analyzed by reverse-phase high performance liquid chromatography with 1,7-diaminoheptane as an internal standard (47Seiler N. Knodgen B. J. Chromatogr. 1980; 221: 227-235Crossref PubMed Scopus (289) Google Scholar). Protein was determined by BCA assay (48Smith P.K. Krohn R.I. Hermanson G.T. Mallia A.K. Gartner F.H.

All transient transfection experiments were performed in triplicates and were repeated at least three times. Cell growth assays, apoptosis assays, and Northern blots were done at least three times. Representative experiments or mean values ± S.D. are shown. Statistical differences were determined by Student's t test. A p value of <0.05 was considered significant. Sulindac Sulfone Leads to Cell Growth Inhibition and Induction of Cell Death in Caco-2 Cells—Sulindac and its derivatives have been shown to either inhibit cell proliferation or induce apoptosis in colon cancer cells (49Akashi H. Han H.J. Iizaka M. Nakamura Y. Int. J. Cancer. 2000; 88: 873-880Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar, 50Goluboff E.T. Shabsigh A. Saidi J.A. Weinstein I.B. Mitra N. Heitjan D. Piazza G.A.

Cancer Res. 2000; 60: 2085-2089PubMed Google Scholar). We wanted to see whether sulindac sulfone, at doses that are clinically relevant, have any growth-suppressive effects on Caco-2 cells. We did cell counting using a hemocytometer to estimate cell proliferation and found that sulindac sulfone at concentrations of 50 μm and above have a statistically significant effect on the inhibition of cell proliferation after 6 days (Fig. 1A). By doing trypan blue cell staining, which stains for dead cells, we found that sulindac sulfone at concentrations of 150 μm and above have a significant effect on inducing cell death (Fig. 1B). Sulindac Sulfone Induces SSAT Leading to Decreased Polyamine Levels in Caco-2 Cells—DNA microarray analysis of 5,300 genes with the cDNA prepared from total RNA from the Caco-2 human colorectal cancer cells treated with 600 μm sulindac sulfone, which is the dose necessary to reduce colony formation by 50% (IC50 dose), showed altered expression of several genes compared with the control-treated Caco-2 cells. One of these genes was SSAT whose expression was induced 3.94 ± 0.64-fold in treated Caco-2 cells as compared with the controls (p < 0.06). The induction in SSAT mRNA expression was confirmed by Northern analysis (Fig. 2A). We next wanted to determine whether clinically relevant concentrations of sulindac sulfone have any effect on SSAT expression. We found that sulindac sulfone at concentrations of 100 μm and above led to an induction in SSAT mRNA (data not shown). To determine whether this induction of SSAT expression is at the level of SSAT transcription, we did transient transfection experiments using the Full-SSAT-luc reporter promoter construct, which has 3.53 kb of the SSAT 5′ promoter flanking region in front of the luciferase gene, and then treated the cells with various concentrations of sulindac sulfone. Sulindac sulfone at concentrations of 100 μm or greater led to an induction in the Full-SSAT-luc promoter activity in the Caco-2 cells after 48 h of incubation (Fig. 2B). These data suggest that sulindac sulfone increases the SSAT gene expression at the level of transcription. Next we wanted to see whether this induction in SSAT promoter activity and SSAT RNA affects t"
https://openalex.org/W2029344085,"Treatment of cells with epidermal growth factor (EGF) promotes the activation of the small GTP-binding protein Cdc42, as well as its phosphorylation in cells. The EGF-dependent phosphorylation of Cdc42 occurs at tyrosine 64 in the Switch II domain and appears to be mediated through the Src tyrosine kinase, because both the expression of a dominant-negative Src mutant (mouse Src(K297R)) and treatment of cells with the Src kinase inhibitor PP2 blocks the EGF-stimulated phosphorylation of Cdc42, whereas expression of an activated Src mutant (Src(Y529F)) promotes phosphorylation in the absence of EGF treatment. The EGF-stimulated phosphorylation of Cdc42 is not required for its activation, nor does it directly affect the interactions of activated Cdc42 with target/effector proteins including PAK, ACK, WASP, or IQGAP. However, the EGF-stimulated phosphorylation of Cdc42 is accompanied by an enhancement in the interaction of Cdc42 with the Rho-GDP dissociation inhibitor (RhoGDI). The EGF-stimulated activation of Cdc42 does require activated Src, as well as the Vav2 protein, a member of the Dbl family of guanine nucleotide exchange factors. Src catalyzes the tyrosine phosphorylation of Vav2, and overexpression of Vav2 together with activated Src (Src(Y529F)) can completely bypass the need for EGF to promote the activation of Cdc42. Thus, EGF signaling through Src appears to have dual regulatory effects on Cdc42: 1) it leads to the activation of Cdc42 as mediated by the Vav2 guanine nucleotide exchange factor, and 2) it results in the phosphorylation of Cdc42, which stimulates the binding of RhoGDI, perhaps to direct the movement of Cdc42 to a specific cellular site to trigger a signaling response, because Cdc42-RhoGDI interactions are essential for Cdc42-induced cellular transformation.

Cdc42 is a member of the Rho subfamily of Ras-related GTP-binding proteins and has been implicated in a wide range of cellular processes and signaling activities. Among its best known actions is the regulation of actin cytoskeletal architecture, because microinjection of activated Cdc42 was found to give rise to filopodia formation, whereas the closely related Rac and RhoA proteins were implicated in membrane ruffling and in the generation of actin stress fibers, respectively (1.Ridley A.J.

A number of different extracellular stimuli including epidermal growth factor (EGF) have been shown to mediate the regulation of the activation-deactivation (GTP-binding/GTPase) cycle of Cdc42. The addition of EGF to NIH 3T3 cells is accompanied by a rapid increase in the levels of GTP-bound Cdc42 (11.Tu S. Cerione R.A. J. Biol.

The Cdc42-specific target, ACK2, together with its tyrosine phosphosubstrate, SH3PX1 (also known as sorting nexin 9), was shown to stimulate the sorting and degradation of EGF receptors (15.Lin Q. Lo C.G. Cerione R.A. Yang W. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 10134-10138Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). It also was found that ACK1 and ACK2 are able to bind to clathrin (16.Yang W. Lo C.G. Dispenza T. Cerione R.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 17468-17473Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar, 17.Teo M. Tan L. Lim L. Manser E. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 18392-18398Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar), which presumably represents an early step in the ACK/SH3PX1-mediated sorting of EGF receptors. Activated (GTP-bound) Cdc42 negatively regulates the binding of ACK/SH3PX1 to clathrin (16.Yang W. Lo C.G. Dispenza T. Cerione R.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 17468-17473Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar) and thus may serve to set the timing for EGF receptor sorting. Likewise, recently we have found that activated forms of Cdc42 block the binding of the Cbl ubiquitin ligase to EGF receptors, thereby providing a mechanism for regulating the timing of receptor ubiquitination (18.Wu W.J. Tu S.S. Cerione R.A. Cell. 2003; 114: 715-725Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (169) Google Scholar). In this study, we have set out to determine how EGF receptors direct the activation of Cdc42 in cells. Because we had originally identified Cdc42 through its ability to serve as a phosphosubstrate for the EGF receptor in reconstituted phospholipid vesicle systems (19.Hart M.J. Polakis P.G. Evans T. Cerione R.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 5990-6001Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), we were especially interested in the possible link between phosphorylation and the EGF-dependent activation of Cdc42. Here we show that Cdc42 undergoes EGF-dependent tyrosine phosphorylation in cells; however, this phosphorylation event is not essential for the activation of Cdc42 but does appear to influence its ability to bind to RhoGDI, which plays an essential role in Cdc42-mediated cellular signaling and transformation (20.Lin Q. Fuji R.N. Yang W. Cerione R.A. Curr. Biol. 2003; 13: 1469-1479Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). We further demonstrate that the EGF-dependent activation of Cdc42 is mediated through the Src tyrosine kinase and Vav2, a widely distributed member of the Dbl family of GEFs, which like the hematopoietic-specific Vav1 protein can bind directly to the EGF receptor (21.Bustelo X.R.

Thus, EGF receptor activation exerts multiple regulatory influences on the signaling capability of Cdc42. Materials and Antibodies—EGF was purchased from Calbiochem. Monoclonal antibodies to hemagglutinin (HA) and anti-Myc were obtained from Covance. Monoclonal anti-phosphotyrosine G410 antibody and the cDNAs encoding constitutively active mouse Src (Src(Y529F)) and kinase-defective mouse Src (Src(K297R)) in the pUSE vector were obtained from Upstate Biotechnology, Inc. The Src kinase inhibitor PP2 was from Calbiochem. Cell Culture and Preparation of Cell Extracts—COS-7 and HEK293 cells were maintained in a humidified 7% CO2 environment in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 100 units/ml penicillin and 100 μg/ml streptomycin (Invitrogen) and with 10% fetal bovine serum. The cells were washed with ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline and then resuspended in lysis buffer (20 mm HEPES, pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl, 1% Nonidet P-40, 10 mm MgCl2, 1 mm EDTA, 20 mm sodium fluoride, 1 mm sodium orthovanadate, 20 mm β-glycerol phosphate, 10 μg/ml leupeptin, and 10 μg/ml aprotinin) for 15 min at room temperature prior to use. Src Kinase Assay—Recombinant human wild-type Src, expressed in Sf9 insect cells as a histidine-tagged protein and purified by nickelnitrilotriacetic acid-agarose chromatography as an active kinase (>40,000 units/mg of protein where 1 unit = 1 pmol of Src substrate peptide phosphorylated per minute), was purchased from Upstate Biotechnology, Inc. Ten μg of Escherichia coli-expressed GST-Cdc42, prepared as previously described (27.Wu W.J. Lin R. Cerione R.A. Manor D. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 16655-16658Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar), were added to 10 μl of Src reaction buffer (100 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.2, 125 mm MgCl2, 25 mm MnCl2, 2 mm EGTA, 0.25 mm sodium orthovanadate, and 2 mm dithiothreitol). Five μl of active Src protein (20 units of kinase activity) were then added to the reaction mixture and incubated with 100 μCi of [γ-32P]ATP and 5 μm ATP for 10 min (final assay volume, 100 μl). Ten μl of SDS loading buffer were added to stop the reaction, and the reaction mixture was then subjected to SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. Molecular Constructs—Point mutants were generated using polymerase chain reaction from a cDNA encoding Cdc42 that had been subcloned into the BamHI-EcoRI site of pcDNA3. The cDNAs encoding different Cdc42 constructs were then transiently expressed in COS-7 cells as HA-tagged proteins. Assaying the Activation of Cdc42 in Cells Using the Limit Cdc42/Rac-binding Domain from PAK—Activation of cellular Cdc42 was assayed as previously described (11.Tu S. Cerione R.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 19656-19665Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar, 28.Bagrodia S. Taylor S.J. Jordan K.A. VanAelst L. Cerione R.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 23633-23636Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (274) Google Scholar), based on a procedure originally developed for Ras (29.Taylor S.J. Shalloway D. Curr. Biol. 1996; 6: 1621-1627Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (352) Google Scholar). COS-7 cells were transiently transfected with the cDNA for wild-type Cdc42 in the pcDNA3 vector. The cells were allowed to grow in the presence of 10% fetal bovine serum for 24 h and then starved for 4 h, followed by stimulation with 50 ng/ml of EGF. Twenty minutes after stimulation, the cells were lysed in lysis buffer (20 mm HEPES, pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl, 1% Nonidet P-40, 20 mm NaF, 20 mmβ-glycerolphosphate, 20 μm GTP, 1 mm sodium orthovanadate, and 10 μg/ml each of leupeptin and aprotonin) and then incubated with 50 μg of GST-PBD (for p21-binding domain from PAK). The cells were rocked at 4 °C for 3 h. GST-PBD was then precipitated with glutathione-agarose beads, washed three times with lysis buffer, and subjected to SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and immunoblotting using the indicated antibodies. Cellular Transformation—NIH 3T3 cells stably expressing Cdc42 (F28L) and Cdc42(F28L,Y64A) were generated, and their abilities to form colonies in soft agar were assayed as outlined in Tu et al. (10.Tu S.S. Wu W.J. Yang W. Nolbant P. Hahn K. Cerione R.A. Biochemistry. 2002; 41: 12350-12358Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar) and Wu et al. (18.Wu W.J. Tu S.S. Cerione R.A. Cell. 2003; 114: 715-725Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (169) Google Scholar). Cdc42 Is Phosphorylated in Cells by the Src Kinase in an EGF-dependent Manner—The mammalian Cdc42 was originally identified using a reconstitution assay to search for possible participants in the EGF receptor-coupled signaling pathway (19.Hart M.J. Polakis P.G. Evans T. Cerione R.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 5990-6001Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Specifically, Cdc42 was phosphorylated in an EGF-dependent manner in reconstituted phospholipid vesicles containing the purified EGF receptor and crude extracts from bovine brain membranes. Thus, we were interested in seeing whether Cdc42 was also phosphorylated in a similar fashion in living cells and whether this was important for the EGF-stimulated activation of the GTP-binding protein. Fig. 1 (A and B, top left panels) shows that when either COS-7 or HEK293 cells transiently expressing HA-tagged Cdc42 were treated with 50 ng/ml EGF, the GTP-binding protein was phosphorylated in an EGF-dependent manner, as read-out by Western blotting with an anti-phosphotyrosine antibody (4G10). The phosphorylation of Cdc42 peaked within 10 min of treatment with the growth factor and was sustained for 30 min (data not shown). As will be demonstrated below, the phosphorylation can be significantly attenuated by specific mutations of Cdc42 and can be obtained with Myc-tagged Cdc42, thus ruling out the trivial possibility that the HA tag was the site of phosphorylation. Because we had earlier found that purified Cdc42 showed little ability to be phosphorylated directly by the purified EGF receptor in vitro, we suspected that the EGF-stimulated phosphorylation of Cdc42 in cells was mediated through another tyrosine kinase. One interesting candidate was Src, because it has been shown that the Src tyrosine kinase acts downstream from the EGF receptor (30.Bouton A.H. Kanner S.B. Vines R.R. Wang H.C. Gibbs J.B. Parsons J.T. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1991; 11: 945-953Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar, 31.Maa M.C. Leu T.H. McCarley D.J. Schatzman R.C. Parsons S.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 6981-6985Crossref PubMed Scopus (290) Google Scholar, 32.Biscardi J.S. Maa M.C. Tice D.A. Cox M.E. Leu T.H. Parsons S.J. J. Biol.

Biol. 1997; 13: 513-609Crossref PubMed Scopus (2175) Google Scholar). Thus, we transiently expressed the kinase-defective mouse Src(K297R) mutant, together with HA-tagged Cdc42, in both COS-7 and HEK293 cells that were then treated with EGF. As shown in Fig. 1 (A and B, middle left panels), kinase-defective Src(K297R) blocked the EGF-dependent phosphorylation of Cdc42 in each of these cell types. Likewise, the treatment of cells with the Src kinase inhibitor PP2 eliminated the EGF-dependent phosphorylation of Cdc42 (Fig. 1, A and B, bottom left panels). In the absence of EGF treatment, expression of wild-type Src did not catalyze the phosphorylation of HA-tagged Cdc42 in cells (Fig. 2A, top panel), whereas the constitutively active mouse Src(Y529F) mutant was able to elicit the tyrosine phosphorylation of Cdc42. Activated (GTPase-defective) Cdc42 (Q61L) appeared to show a stronger phosphorylation signal in this experiment; however, what we have found from several experiments is that after correcting for the levels of expression of the HA-tagged Cdc42 proteins, there are little or no significant differences between wild-type and activated (GTP-bound) Cdc42. Insect cell-expressed, purified Src kinase was able to phosphorylate directly purified, E. coli-recombinant Cdc42 in vitro. An example is shown for GST-Cdc42(Q61L) in Fig. 2B (top panel); the same was also true for GST-Cdc42 (wild type) (data not shown). Thus, overall, the results presented in Figs. 1 and 2 (A and B) indicated that the EGF-stimulated phosphorylation of Cdc42 was mediated by Src. Tyrosine 64 on Cdc42 Is a Major Site of Phosphorylation by the Src Kinase—We next set out to identify the tyrosine residue(s) that is phosphorylated in an EGF- and Src kinase-dependent manner. One particularly attractive residue was tyrosine 64, which is present within the Switch II domain (i.e. a conformationally sensitive region first identified in Ras (34.Milburn M.V. Tong L. Devos A.M. Brunger A. Yamaizumi Z. Nishimura S. Kim S.-H. Science. 1990; 247: 939-945Crossref PubMed Scopus (849) Google Scholar)), because it lies within a sequence (EDYDR) that is favorable for phosphorylation by certain tyrosine kinases including Src (35.Brown M.T. Cooper J.A. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1996; 1287: 121-149Crossref PubMed Scopus (1086) Google Scholar). As shown in Fig. 2B (upper panel), the Cdc42(Y64F) mutant did not serve as a phosphosubstrate when assayed in vitro. The same was true when examining either the EGF-dependent or Src(Y529F)-catalyzed phosphorylation of Cdc42(Y64F) or Cdc42(Y64E) in cells (Fig. 2C, upper right panel), whereas changing the tyrosine residue at position 40, located in the Switch I region of Cdc42, to a cysteine did not diminish phosphorylation (upper left panel). Changing tyrosine 64 to either a phenylalanine or glutamic acid within an activated (Q61L) background also significantly inhibited phosphorylation. However, the fact that some hint of phosphorylation was sometimes detectable on both the Cdc42(Q61L,Y64F) and Cdc42 (Q61L,Y64E) mutants (Fig. 2C, upper left panel) suggested that although tyrosine 64 was likely to be the primary phosphorylation acceptor site, secondary phosphorylation sites may become accessible when Cdc42 is in the GTP-bound state. Is the Phosphorylation of Cdc42 Necessary for Its Interactions with Target/Effectors?—Thus far, we have not found any indication that the EGF- and/or Src-catalyzed phosphorylation of Cdc42 directly influences its interactions with known target/effector proteins. Fig. 3 shows the results of experiments where Myc-tagged Cdc42(Q61L) was transiently expressed with either wild-type Src or Src(Y529F) and together with different HA-tagged target/effectors in COS-7 cells. There were no detectable differences in the ability of activated Cdc42 to be co-immunoprecipitated with these targets (Fig. 3, left panels) when the GTP-binding protein was phosphorylated in a Src(Y529F)-dependent manner (Fig. 3, right panels). The same was true when examining the interactions of activated Cdc42 with two endogenous targets, IQGAP and MRCK. The Src-catalyzed Phosphorylation of Tyrosine 64 on Cdc42 Is Accompanied by an Enhanced Binding to RhoGDI—Structural studies of the Cdc42-RhoGDI complex have demonstrated that the Switch II domain of Cdc42 forms an important part of the binding interface with RhoGDI (36.Hoffman G.R. Nassar N. Cerione R.A. Cell. 2000; 100: 345-356Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (415) Google Scholar). Thus, we examined whether the Src-catalyzed phosphorylation of tyrosine 64 on Cdc42 influenced its interactions with this regulatory protein. This was done by co-expressing HA-tagged wild-type Cdc42 or the Cdc42(Q61L) mutant, which also binds RhoGDI, with Myc-tagged RhoGDI and either wild-type Src or the constitutively active Src(Y529F) mutant. As shown in Fig. 4, co-expression of the Cdc42 proteins with activated Src(Y529F), under conditions that resulted in the phosphorylation of Cdc42 (top panel), caused an enhancement in the amount of RhoGDI that was co-immunoprecipitated with the anti-HA-tagged GTP-binding protein (bottom panel), compared with that detected when Cdc42 was co-expressed with wild-type Src. We could not detect the association of RhoGDI with Cdc42 proteins that were mutated at position 64. The RhoGDI typically appeared as a smear on the anti-Myc Western blots after its immunoprecipitation from COS-7 cells, which may mean that this regulatory protein was susceptible to phosphorylation in cells. At the present time, we know very little regarding how Cdc42-RhoGDI interactions are regulated or why the tyrosine phosphorylation of Cdc42 might enhance its ability to bind RhoGDI. It is interesting that the x-ray crystal structure for the Cdc42-RhoGDI complex (36.Hoffman G.R. Nassar N. Cerione R.A. Cell. 2000; 100: 345-356Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (415) Google Scholar) shows that tyrosine 64 of Cdc42 comes into close proximity of lysine residues 43 and 52 from RhoGDI, and so one attractive possibility was that the negative charge accompanying the phosphorylation of tyrosine 64 was stabilized by the positive charges provided by these basic residues. However, if this were the case, it might have been expected that simply changing tyrosine 64 to glutamic acid would have enhanced the interactions between Cdc42 and RhoGDI, but this did not occur (Fig. 4, bottom panel). Thus, it may be that other mechanisms account for the enhanced binding of RhoGDI that accompanies the EGF/Src-dependent tyrosine phosphorylation of Cdc42. The phosphorylation of Cdc42 and its effects on Cdc42-RhoGDI interactions may have important signaling consequences. We have previously shown that the constitutively active Cdc42(F28L) mutant induces the transformation of NIH 3T3 fibroblasts, as read-out either by the growth of cells in low serum or their ability to form colonies in soft agar (7.Lin R. Bagrodia S. Cerione R.A. Manor D. Curr. Biol. 1997; 7: 794-797Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (187) Google Scholar). Recently, we have also demonstrated an essential role for RhoGDI in Cdc42-induced cellular transformation (20.Lin Q. Fuji R.N. Yang W. Cerione R.A. Curr. Biol. 2003; 13: 1469-1479Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). This then raises the question of whether a phosphorylation-defective Cdc42 mutant that is impaired in its ability to bind RhoGDI is still able to transform fibroblasts. The data presented in Fig. 5 shows that this is not the case. A Cdc42(F28L,Y64A) double mutant, which can be stably expressed to levels that are within 50–70% of the expression levels for Cdc42(F28L), is severely compromised both in its ability to stimulate growth in low serum and to form colonies in soft agar. Although this does not definitively prove that the phosphorylation of Cdc42 at position 64 is essential for transformation, it does indicate that tyrosine 64 is a critical residue and is consistent with the notion that the phosphorylation of this tyrosine residue, and the resultant enhanced binding of RhoGDI, contribute to the transformation signal. Is the Src-catalyzed Phosphorylation of Cdc42 Essential for the EGF-dependent Activation of the GTP-binding Protein?—We had previously shown that treatment of NIH 3T3 cells with EGF led to a relatively rapid increase in the levels of GTP-bound (activated) Cdc42 (11.Tu S. Cerione R.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 19656-19665Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar), as read-out by an assay that examines the binding of this GTP-binding protein to its limit-binding domain on PAK (called the PBD). The same is true for COS-7 cells transiently transfected with HA-tagged Cdc42, as shown in Fig. 6 (top panel). In these cells, the EGF-dependent activation of Cdc42 persists through 30 min of treatment with the growth factor. When COS-7 cells were transiently transfected with constitutively active Src(Y529F), there was an obvious increase in the basal levels of GTP-bound Cdc42 (i.e. in the absence of any growth factor treatment; Fig. 6, middlepanel), suggesting that the activated Src kinase can promote the activation of the GTP-binding protein. However, when the COS-7 cells were transiently transfected with a cDNA encoding the kinase-defective Src mutant (Src(K297R)), both the basal and EGF-stimulated activation of Cdc42 were completely abolished (Fig. 6, bottom panel). These results indicate that like the EGF-stimulated phosphorylation of Cdc42, the EGF-promoted activation of this GTP-binding protein is mediated by the Src kinase. We therefore asked the question of whether the Src-catalyzed phosphorylation was directly responsible for the EGF- and Src-mediated activation of Cdc42. However, the data presented in Fig. 7 shows that this was not the case. The ability of Src(Y529F) to promote the activation of Cdc42, as monitored by the ability of GST-PBD to precipitate GTP-bound Cdc42 (Fig. 7, middle panel), occurred independently of whether Cdc42 could be phosphorylated at tyrosine 64 (Fig. 7, top panel). Thus, the HA-tagged Cdc42(Y64F) mutant was as effective as HA-tagged wild-type Cdc42 in its ability to undergo activation and thus to be precipitated by GST-PBD (Fig. 7, middle panel). Note that in these experiments, the GTPase-defective Cdc42(Q61L) mutant served as a positive control for the PBD assay and was able to bind to GST-PBD in the presence and absence of Src(Y529F). What Is the Underlying Mechanism for the EGF- and Src-dependent Activation of Cdc42?—Because the Src-catalyzed phosphorylation of Cdc42 did not directly result in its activation, we suspected that the EGF receptor and Src were acting through a GEF. One potentially interesting candidate was intersectin-1L, because this is a highly specific GEF for Cdc42 (37.Hussain N.K. Jenna S. Glogaver M. Quinn C.C. Wasiak S. Guipponi M. Antonarakis S.E. Kay B.K. Stossel T.P. Lamarche-Vane N. McPherson P.S. Nat. Cell Biol. 2001; 3: 927-932Crossref PubMed Scopus (301) Google Scholar), which we have shown binds to the Cdc42-target/effector ACK2, a nonreceptor tyrosine kinase. 2W. Smith and R. Cerione, unpublished data. Although intersectin-1L appears to be exclusively found in neuronal cells, a second related form (intersectin-2L) appears to be more broadly distributed. Because we had earlier shown that Src associates with ACK2 (38.Yang W. Lin Q. Guan J.L. Cerione R.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 8524-8530Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar), we wondered whether an ACK-Src complex might bind to and phosphorylate intersectin-2L, which in turn could stimulate its GEF activity toward Cdc42. However, thus far, we have not obtained any evidence for a link between Src kinase activity and the ability of the intersectin proteins to function as Cdc42-GEFs. We then turned"

Yamashita H. Nakamura T. Nagano Y. Nakamura S. Brain Res. 2002; 938: 73-80Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). In addition, α-synuclein knockout mice display increased dopamine release under stimulated conditions (9Abeliovich A. Schmitz Y. Farinas I. Choi-Lundberg D. Ho W.H. Castillo P.E. Shinsky N.

Moreover, α-synuclein inhibits dopamine biosynthesis (10Perez R.G. Waymire J.C. Lin E. Liu J.J. Guo F. Zigmond M.J. J. Neurosci. 2002; 22: 3090-3099Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), suggesting that α-synuclein is a negative regulator of dopamine neurotransmission.Synphilin-1 represents a cytoplasmic protein that interacts with α-synuclein (11Engelender S. Kaminsky Z. Guo X. Sharp A.H. Amaravi R.K. Kleiderlein J.J. Margolis R.L. Troncoso J.C. Lanahan A.A. Worley P.F. Dawson V.L. Dawson T.M. Ross C.A. Nat.

Chem. 2002; 277: 10273-10282Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar). Synphilin-1 has been found to constitute an intrinsic component of LBs in PD, indicating that it might be involved in the pathogenesis of PD (13Wakabayashi K. Engelender S. Yoshimoto M. Tsuji S. Ross C.A. Takahashi H. Ann. Neurol. 2000; 47: 521-523Crossref PubMed Scopus (240) Google Scholar). Synphilin-1 contains six ankyrin (ANK) repeats (Swiss Protein Database number Q9Y6H5), a coiled-coil domain, and an ATP/GTP-binding site (11Engelender S. Kaminsky Z. Guo X. Sharp A.H. Amaravi R.K. Kleiderlein J.J. Margolis R.L. Troncoso J.C. Lanahan A.A. Worley P.F. Dawson V.L. Dawson T.M. Ross C.A. Nat. Genet. 1999; 22: 110-114Crossref PubMed Scopus (435) Google Scholar). Nonetheless, the physiological function of synphilin-1 remains unclear. Coexpression of synphilin-1 and α-synuclein in cells was found to lead to the deposition of eosinophilic inclusions that resembled LBs (11Engelender S. Kaminsky Z. Guo X. Sharp A.H. Amaravi R.K. Kleiderlein J.J. Margolis R.L. Troncoso J.C. Lanahan A.A. Worley P.F. Dawson V.L. Dawson T.M. Ross C.A. Nat. Genet. 1999; 22: 110-114Crossref PubMed Scopus (435) Google Scholar, 14McLean P.J. Kawamata H. Hyman B.T. Neuroscience. 2001; 104: 901-912Crossref PubMed Scopus (183) Google Scholar), supporting the hypothesis that the interaction might be related to LB formation. Recently, a mutation in the synphilin-1 gene leading to an amino acid substitution of cysteine for arginine in position 621 was reported in two apparently sporadic PD patients (15Marx F.P. Holzmann C. Strauss K.M. Li L. Eberhardt O. Gerhardt E. Cookson M.R. Hernandez D. Farrer M.J. Kachergus J. Engelender S. Ross C.A. Berger K. Schols L. Schulz J.B. Riess O. Kruger R. Hum. Mol. Genet. 2003; 12: 1223-1231Crossref PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar). The number of inclusions in cells expressing this mutant synphilin-1 was significantly reduced compared with wild type synphilin-1 (15Marx F.P. Holzmann C. Strauss K.M. Li L. Eberhardt O. Gerhardt E. Cookson M.R. Hernandez D. Farrer M.J. Kachergus J. Engelender S. Ross C.A. Berger K. Schols L. Schulz J.B. Riess O. Kruger R. Hum. Mol. Genet. 2003; 12: 1223-1231Crossref PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar).Proteins fated to degrade in proteasomes are subjected to modification by ubiquitin. Ubiquitination proceeds through a sequential enzymatic reaction composed of ubiquitin-activating enzyme (E1), ubiquitin conjugating enzyme (E2), and ubiquitin ligase (E3). The exquisite specificity for proteins destined for ubiquitination is usually determined by a diverse family of E3s with specific E2s. Parkin is a RING finger-type E3 that contains two RING finger domains and an IBR (in between RING fingers) domain. One type of autosomal recessive juvenile parkinsonism, which represents the major cause of juvenile PD, results from mutations of the Parkin gene (16Kitada T. Asakawa S. Hattori N. Matsumine H. Yamamura Y. Minoshima S. Yokochi M. Mizuno Y. Shimizu N. Nature. 1998; 392: 605-608Crossref PubMed Scopus (4123) Google Scholar). Autosomal recessive juvenile parkinsonism-linked Parkin mutations have been demonstrated to disrupt E3 activity (17Shimura H. Hattori N. Kubo S. Mizuno Y. Asakawa S. Minoshima S. Shimizu N. Iwai K.

Tanaka Y. Huang H. Gao J. Ross C.A. Dawson V.L. Dawson T.M. Nat. Med. 2001; 7: 1144-1150Crossref PubMed Scopus (649) Google Scholar). Coexpression of synphilin-1, α-synuclein, and Parkin elicits formation of ubiquitin-positive cytoplasmic inclusions that resemble LBs, suggesting that synphilin-1 might link α-synuclein and Parkin to a common pathogenic mechanism (20Chung K.K.

A recent report demonstrated that Dorfin, an E3 for mutant superoxide dismutase-1, also interacts with and ubiquitinates synphilin-1 (21Ito T. Niwa J.I. Hishikawa N. Ishigaki S. Doyu M. Sobue G. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; Google Scholar). Like Parkin, Dorfin contains two RING finger domains and an IBR domain. Furthermore, Dorfin is colocalized with ubiquitin in LBs of PD, suggesting that Dorfin is also implicated in the pathogenesis of PD.Siah/Sina family proteins represent mammalian homologues of the Drosophila Sina (seven in absentia) protein. Sina is also a RING finger-type E3 that is critically involved in neuronal development of the R7 photoreceptor cell in Drosophila (22Carthew R.W. Rubin G.M. Cell. 1990; 63: 561-577Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (259) Google Scholar). Sina functions downstream of the tyrosine kinase receptor Sevenless and the Ras/Raf mitogen-activated protein kinase pathway (23Dickson B. Sprenger F. Morrison D. Hafen E. Nature. 1992; 360: 600-603Crossref PubMed Scopus (242) Google Scholar, 24Fortini M.E. Simon M.A. Rubin G.M. Nature. 1992; 355: 559-561Crossref PubMed Scopus (265) Google Scholar, 25Neufeld T.P. Tang A.H. Rubin G.M. Genetics. 1998; 148: 277-286Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Sina is required for targeting the transcriptional repressor Tramtrack for proteasome-mediated degradation, which is a requisite step for neuronal differentiation of R7 photoreceptor cells (26Tang A.H. Neufeld T.P. Kwan E. Rubin G.M. Cell. 1997; 90: 459-467Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (200) Google Scholar). In humans, there are two highly conserved Sina homologues, Siah-1 and Siah-2, which are abundantly expressed in the central nervous system, as well as other tissues (27Holloway A.J. Della N.G.

Siah proteins facilitate ubiquitination and proteasome-dependent degradation of multiple proteins, such as DCC (29Hu G. Zhang S. Vidal M. Baer J.L. Xu T. Fearon E.R.

The present report demonstrates that Siah-1 interacts with and ubiquitinates synphilin-1 in vivo, resulting in facilitation of synphilin-1 degradation via the ubiquitin-proteasome pathway.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESYeast Two-hybrid Screening—The full-length human synphilin-1 cDNA was cloned by a library screening as described previously (39Nagano Y. Yamashita H. Nakamura T. Takahashi T. Kondo E. Nakamura S. Neurosci. Lett. 2001; 316: 103-107Crossref PubMed Scopus (6) Google Scholar). The coding region of synphilin-1 cDNA was subcloned into the yeast two-hybrid vector pGBKT-7 (Clontech), which was in-frame fused to the GAL4-binding domain sequence. The recombinant plasmid was introduced into the yeast strain AH109. A rat brain cDNA library constructed in pGAD10 (Clontech) was introduced into the yeast strain expressing the synphilin-1 fusion protein, and ∼1.0 × 106 transformants were screened for growth on SD plate media lacking tryptophan, leucine, histidine, and adenosine. Positive clones were detected by a β-galactosidase assay. An α-Synuclein construct in pGAD10 was used as a positive control for the screening. To eliminate false positives, plasmid DNA from positive clones was purified, amplified, and retransformed into the yeast strain expressing synphilin-1 protein fused to the GAL4-binding domain. The positive clones in this second screening were subjected to DNA sequencing. A BLAST search revealed that one of the isolated positive clones contained a fragment nearly identical to the Siah-1a gene.Vectors and Antibodies—Full-length human Siah-1 cDNA was amplified from a human brain cDNA library (Stratagene) by PCR using a Pfu DNA polymerase (Stratagene) and the following forward and reverse primers: 5′-GAA TTC TCG AGA TGA GCC GTC AGA CTG CTA C-3′ (F1) and 5′-GCG ATC TAG ATC AAC ACA TGG AAA TAG TTA CAT TGA TGC C-3′ (R1). The DNA fragment obtained from PCR was subcloned in a pcDNA3 vector (Invitrogen) in-frame with the Myc tag sequence (pcDNA3-Myc-Siah-1). Human Siah-1 contains an N-terminal RING finger domain (amino acids (aa) 40–75), followed by a conserved cysteine/histidine-rich region (aa 98–152), which might represent two zinc fingers (ZF). Siah-1 contains a substrate-binding domain (SBD) (aa 90–282) at the C terminus that interacts with a number of substrate proteins. The cDNA encoding Siah-1 mutants, such as RING finger domain-deleted Siah-1 (SiahΔN) and SBD-deleted Siah-1 (SiahΔC), were amplified by PCR using the following forward and reverse primers: 5′-GAA TTC TCG AGA CAT GTT GTC CAA CTT GCC GG-3′ (F2) and R1 for SiahΔN and F1 and 5′-GCG ATC TAG ATC AGG TTG TAA TGG ACT TAT GCT G-3′ (R2) for SiahΔC. The DNA fragment obtained from PCR was subcloned into a pcDNA3 vector in-frame with the Myc tag sequence (pcDNA3-Myc-SiahΔN and pcDNA3-Myc-SiahΔC). To construct the tetracycline (Tet)-repressible expression vectors for Siah-1 and SiahΔC, each cDNA encoding Siah-1 or SiahΔC was inserted into a pTet splice vector (Invitrogen) in-frame with the Myc tag sequence (pTet-splice-Myc-Siah-1 and pTet-splice-Myc-SiahΔC). Ubiquitin (Ub) cDNA was amplified by PCR and subcloned into a pcDNA3 vector in-frame with the FLAG tag sequence (pcDNA3-FLAG-Ub). The sequences of all constructs were confirmed by DNA sequencing for both complementary strands. The plasmid pcDNA3.1-Myc-Parkin vector was provided by Drs. N. Hattori and Y. Mizuno. The plasmid pcDNA-Myc-β-TrCP/FWD1 was provided by Drs. S. Kishida and A. Kikuchi. Expression vectors for HA-tagged synphilin-1 (pcDNA3-HA-synphilin-1) and HA-tagged α-synuclein (pcDNA3-HA-α-synuclein; wild type, A53T, A30P) were generated as described previously (39Nagano Y. Yamashita H. Nakamura T. Takahashi T. Kondo E. Nakamura S. Neurosci. Lett. 2001; 316: 103-107Crossref PubMed Scopus (6) Google Scholar, 40Nakamura T. Yamashita H. Nagano Y. Takahashi T. Avraham S. Avraham H. Matsumoto M. Nakamura S. FEBS Lett. 2002; 521: 190-194Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). An anti-synphilin-1 polyclonal antibody was provided by Dr. E. Iseki. An anti-α-synuclein monoclonal antibody was obtained from Pharmingen. An anti-FLAG monoclonal antibody (M2) was obtained from Sigma. An anti-HA monoclonal antibody (F-7), an anti-HA polyclonal antibody (Y-11), an anti-Myc monoclonal antibody (9E10), and normal rabbit IgG (NRI) were obtained from Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc. Siah-1 antiserum was raised against Siah-1 protein fused with glutathione S-transferase (GST) at the N terminus (GST-Siah). The antigen was thoroughly mixed with Freund's complete adjuvant to produce a suspension, which was intradermally injected into rabbits. Identical immunogen was injected five times every week. Phlebotomy was ultimately performed to collect serum. Antiserum was filtered through a GST coupling Hitrap NHS activated HP column (Amersham Biosciences) to eliminate anti-GST antibodies. To purify anti-Siah-1 antibodies, pre-cleared serum was filtered through another column coupling with GST-Siah-1. Siah-1 antibodies were subsequently eluted from the column and dialyzed with phosphate-buffered saline.Cell Culture and Transfection—HEK 293 and human dopaminergic neuroblastoma SH-SY5Y cells were obtained from American Type Culture Collection. Cells were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 10% fetal bovine serum. Transfections of expression vectors into HEK 293 cells were performed by FuGENE 6 (Roche Applied Science) according to the manufacturer's instructions. PC12-Tet cells stably transfected with pTet-tTAk (Invitrogen) were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 10% fetal bovine serum, 5% horse serum, and 0.1 mg/ml hygromycin (Roche Applied Science). To establish a Tet-repressible Siah-1 expression system, PC12-Tet cells were transfected with pTet-splice-Myc-Siah-1 or pTet-splice-Myc-SiahΔC using LipofectAMINE 2000 (Invitrogen). After transfection, cells were grown in a medium containing 0.1 mg/ml hygromycin, 500 ng/ml Tet (Sigma), and 400 μg/ml G418 (Sigma). For 3–4 weeks, colonies were selected by hygromycin and G418. Among the selected colonies, multiple monoclonal cell lines that exhibited Tet-repressible expression of Siah-1 (PC12-Tet-Siah) or SiahΔC (PC12-Tet-ΔC) were established.Immunoprecipitation—HEK 293 cells were transfected with pcDNA3-Myc-Siah-1, pcDNA3-Myc-SiahΔN, pcDNA3-HA-synphilin-1, and pcDNA3-HA-α-synuclein. After 24 h, the cells were cultured with 20 μm MG132 (Calbiochem) for 8 h and then washed with ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline and lysed in lysis buffer (1% Nonidet P-40, 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 10% glycerol, 150 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, pH 8.0) with protease inhibitors (1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 10 μg/ml aprotinin, 10 μg/ml leupeptin). After the lysate protein contents were normalized using a protein assay kit (Bio-Rad), the cell lysate (500 μg/sample) was immunoprecipitated with NRI or anti-HA antibodies using protein G-Sepharose beads (Pierce). For immunoprecipitation of the endogenous proteins from rat brains, adult rat brains were homogenized in 5 volumes of Tris-HCl (50 mm; pH 7.4), KCl (140 mm), EDTA (3 mm), and 0.5% Triton X-100 supplemented with protease inhibitors. The tissue homogenate was centrifuged at 5,000 × g at 4 °C for 20 min. The supernatant was used for immunoprecipitation with one of the following antibodies: normal rabbit IgG, anti-GST, or anti-Siah-1 antibodies. Each immunoprecipitate was divided into two parts, separated on SDS-PAGE, and transferred onto nitrocellulose membranes. Bound proteins were analyzed with immunoblotting.Siah-1 Protein Expression in Rat Tissues—Rat brain protein lysate from various tissues (50 μg/lane) were separated on SDS-PAGE and immunoblotted with anti-Siah-1, anti-synphilin-1, anti-α-synuclein, and anti-α-tubulin antibodies. To determine the specificity of anti-Siah-1 antibody, identical blots of rat protein lysate from various tissues were incubated with anti-Siah-1 antibody preabsorbed with antigen (GST-Siah-1).Confocal Immunofluorescent Staining—Immunofluorescence was performed as described previously (41Nakamura T. Yamashita H. Takahashi T. Nakamura S. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2001; 280: 1085-1092Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar). Briefly, HEK 293 cells cotransfected with pcDNA3-HA-synphilin-1 and pcDNA3-Myc-Siah-1 or SH-SY5Y cells were seeded and grown on glass coverslips in medium. Adherent cells were fixed with neutral buffered 4% (w/v) paraformaldehyde and permeabilized with 0.2% Triton X-100. To assess the distribution of endogenous Siah-1 and synphilin-1, untransfected SH-SY5Y cells were treated with anti-Siah-1 and anti-synphilin-1 antibodies. Anti-Siah-1 and anti-synphilin-1 antibodies preabsorbed with each antigen were also used. To assess the colocalization of synphilin-1 and Siah-1, a double-labeling immunofluorescent staining was performed with a combination of anti-HA and anti-Myc antibodies. Anti-Siah-1, anti-synphilin-1, and anti-HA antibodies were visualized by Alexa Fluor488 anti-rabbit antibody (Molecular Probes). Anti-Myc antibody was visualized by Alexa Fluor 568 anti-mouse antibody (Molecular Probes). Immunostained preparations were examined with the Zeiss LSM510 confocal microscope.Pulse-Chase Assay—A pulse-chase assay was performed as described previously (42Paolini R. Molfetta R. Piccoli M. Frati L. Santoni A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 9611-9616Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar, 43Nag A. Bondar T. Shiv S. Raychaudhuri P. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 21: 6738-6747Crossref PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar). HEK 293 cells were transfected with pcDNA3-HA-synphilin-1 and pcDNA3-Myc-Siah-1, pcDNA3-Myc-SiahΔN, pcDNA3-Myc-Parkin, pcDNA-Myc-β-TrCP/FWD1, or empty pcDNA3-Myc vectors. After 24 h, cells were cultured with 20 μm MG132 for 8 h; cycloheximide (Sigma) was subsequently added to the medium to yield a final concentration of 40 μm, which would inhibit new synthesis of synphilin-1. The cells were cultured for chase intervals of 0, 2, 4, 6, 8, 12, 18, 24, and 48 h and harvested in the lysis buffer after the appropriate chase time. An equal amount of protein from each lysate was separated on SDS-PAGE and immunoblotted with an anti-HA antibody. The degree of synphilin-1 expression was quantitated by densitometric analysis with NIH Image software.Ubiquitination Assay—An in vivo ubiquitination assay was performed as described previously (12Wheeler T.C.

HEK 293 cells were transfected with pcDNA3-Myc-Siah-1, pcDNA3-Myc-SiahΔN, pcDNA3-Myc-SiahΔC, pcDNA3-Myc-Parkin, pcDNA-Myc-β-TrCP/FWD1, pcDNA3-HA-synphilin-1, pcDNA3-HA-α-synuclein, or pcDNA3-FLAG-Ub. After 24 h, cells were cultured for 8 h with 20 μm MG132. Cells were lysed and immunoprecipitated with an anti-HA antibody. Each precipitate was divided into two parts, separated on SDS-PAGE, and analyzed by immunoblotting with anti-FLAG and anti-HA antibodies to detect ubiquitin-conjugated synphilin-1.Preparation of GST Fusion-Siah Proteins and in Vitro Binding Assays—To generate Siah-1 protein fused with GST at the N terminus (GST-Siah), the coding region of Siah-1 cDNA was amplified by PCR using the following forward and reverse primers: 5′-CTC GAA TTC ATG AGC CGT CAG ACT GCT ACA G-3′ (GF1) and 5′-CTC CTC GAG TCA ACA CAT GGA AAT AGT TAC ATT GAT GCC-3′ (GR1).

https://openalex.org/W2016713141,"Trypanosoma brucei is a parasitic protist responsible for sleeping sickness in humans. The procyclic form of this parasite, transmitted by tsetse flies, is considered to be dependent on oxidative phosphorylation for ATP production. Indeed, its respiration was 55% inhibited by oligomycin, which is the most specific inhibitor of the mitochondrial F0/F1-ATP synthase. However, a 10-fold excess of this compound did not significantly affect the intracellular ATP concentration and the doubling time of the parasite was only 1.5-fold increased, suggesting that oxidative phosphorylation is not essential for procyclic trypanosomes. To further investigate the sites of ATP production, we studied the role of two ATP producing enzymes, which are involved in the synthesis of pyruvate from phosphoenolpyruvate: the glycosomal pyruvate phosphate dikinase (PPDK) and the cytosolic pyruvate kinase (PYK). The parasite was not affected by PPDK gene knockout. In contrast, inhibition of PYK expression by RNA interference was lethal for these cells. In the absence of PYK activity, the intracellular ATP concentration was reduced by up to 2.3-fold, whereas the intracellular pyruvate concentration was not reduced. Furthermore, we show that this mutant cell line still excreted acetate from d-glucose metabolism, and both the wild type and mutant cell lines consumed pyruvate present in the growth medium with similar high rates, indicating that in the absence of PYK activity pyruvate is still present in the trypanosomes. We conclude that PYK is essential because of its ATP production, which implies that the cytosolic substrate level phosphorylation is essential for the growth of procyclic trypanosomes.

The trypanosomatids are a group of parasitic protozoa of major medical and veterinary significance, including the human pathogens, Trypanosoma brucei, Trypanosoma cruzi, and Leishmania spp., which are responsible for sleeping sickness, Chagas disease, and leishmaniosis, respectively (1.Lumsden H.R. Evans D.A. Biology of the Kinetoplastida. Academic Press, New York1976Google Scholar). Recently, an extremely powerful reverse genetic approach, i.e. RNA interference (RNAi), 1The abbreviations used are: RNAiRNA interferenceFCSfetal calf serumPYKpyruvate kinasePEPphosphoenolpyruvateCCCPcarbonyl cyanide m-chlorophenyl hydrazonePEPCKphosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinasePPDKpyruvate phosphate dikinaseUTRuntranslated regionPBSphosphate-buffered salineSHAMsalicylhydroxamic acidMOPS4-morpholinepropanesulfonic acid. has been characterized in T. brucei (2.Ngo H.

RNAi has also been developed as a reverse genetic tool for another African trypanosome, Trypanosoma congolense, which infects livestock (8.Inoue N. Otsu K. Ferraro D.M. Donelson J.E. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 2002; 120: 309-313Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). Unfortunately, RNAi has not been shown to operate in Leishmania spp. (9.Robinson K.A. Beverley S.M. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 2003; 128: 217-228Crossref PubMed Scopus (224) Google Scholar) or in T. cruzi to date. 2J. E. Donelson, personal communication. In studying pathways shared by all of these trypanosomatids, such as those of carbohydrate metabolism, the T. brucei procyclic form constitutes an excellent model, thus conclusions drawn from RNAi experiments with these cells may also be applicable to the other parasites.

The procyclic trypanosomes grown in the commonly used SDM-79/FCS medium use d-glucose and l-threonine as major carbon sources, whereas, l-proline and l-glutamine are moderately consumed (10.Cross G.A. Klein R.A. Linstead D.J. Parasitology. 1975; 71: 311-326Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). l-Threonine is converted into equimolar amounts of excreted glycine and acetate, in a pathway involving acetyl-CoA as an intermediate metabolite (10.Cross G.A. Klein R.A. Linstead D.J. Parasitology. 1975; 71: 311-326Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar, 11.Linstead D.J. Klein R.A. Cross G.A. J. Gen. Microbiol. 1977; 101: 243-251Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). d-Glucose catabolism is more elaborate as exemplified by the end products excreted, which include acetate, succinate, l-alanine, lactate, and carbon dioxide (CO2) (12.Fairlamb A.H. Opperdoes F.R. Morgan M.J. Carbohydrate Metabolism in Cultured Cells. Plenum Publishing Corp., New York1986: 183-224Crossref Google Scholar, 13.Cazzulo J.J. FASEB J. 1992; 6: 3153-3161Crossref PubMed Scopus (175) Google Scholar). Most of the enzymes involved in the conversion of d-glucose into pyruvate are located in glycosomes (peroxisome-like organelles) (14.Opperdoes F.R. Annu. Rev. Microbiol. 1987; 41: 127-151Crossref PubMed Scopus (429) Google Scholar, 15.Michels P.A. Hannaert V. Bringaud F. Parasitol. Today. 2000; 16: 482-489Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar). Because of the apparent absence of pyruvate kinase (PYK) activity, it was originally proposed that pyruvate is produced from cytosolic PEP by the glycosomal PEP carboxykinase, the glycosomal malate dehydrogenase, and the cytosolic malic enzyme (see Fig. 1). In this scheme, pyruvate is then converted in the mitochondrion, to acetyl-CoA, which feeds the tricarboxylic acid cycle. In 1998, Van Hellemond et al. (16.Van Hellemond J.J. Opperdoes F.R. Tielens A.G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 3036-3041Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar) showed that acetyl-CoA can also be converted into the excreted acetate by mitochondrial acetate:succinate-CoA transferase, which involves a succinate/succinyl-CoA cycle, thereby generating ATP by the mitochondrial succinyl-CoA synthetase (16.Van Hellemond J.J. Opperdoes F.R. Tielens A.G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 3036-3041Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar) (Fig. 1). A possible role for NADH-dependent fumarate reductase in the production of the excreted succinate was controversial (17.Tielens A.G. Van Hellemond J.J. Parasitol. Today. 1998; 14: 265-271Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar, 18.Turrens J. Parasitol. Today. 1999; 15: 346-348Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (7) Google Scholar). However, it was commonly assumed that succinate is a byproduct of the mitochondrial tricarboxylic acid cycle (12.Fairlamb A.H. Opperdoes F.R. Morgan M.J. Carbohydrate Metabolism in Cultured Cells. Plenum Publishing Corp., New York1986: 183-224Crossref Google Scholar, 13.Cazzulo J.J. FASEB J. 1992; 6: 3153-3161Crossref PubMed Scopus (175) Google Scholar). Similarly, CO2 was considered to be primarily produced by the tricarboxylic acid cycle (12.Fairlamb A.H. Opperdoes F.R. Morgan M.J. Carbohydrate Metabolism in Cultured Cells. Plenum Publishing Corp., New York1986: 183-224Crossref Google Scholar, 17.Tielens A.G. Van Hellemond J.J. Parasitol. Today. 1998; 14: 265-271Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar). l-Alanine seems to be produced from pyruvate by the alanine aminotransferase (12.Fairlamb A.H. Opperdoes F.R. Morgan M.J. Carbohydrate Metabolism in Cultured Cells. Plenum Publishing Corp., New York1986: 183-224Crossref Google Scholar) but the origin of lactate is not clear. Notwithstanding the debate on end products, the view that ATP production in the procyclic form of T. brucei depended on oxidative phosphorylation, with the respiratory chain fed primarily by reducing equivalents produced by the tricarboxylic acid cycle, was widely held (12.Fairlamb A.H. Opperdoes F.R. Morgan M.J. Carbohydrate Metabolism in Cultured Cells. Plenum Publishing Corp., New York1986: 183-224Crossref Google Scholar, 13.Cazzulo J.J.

Today. 1996; 12: 465-471Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar). However, during this last year three independent reports have led to an important revision of this model. First, Bochud-Allemann and Schneider (20.Bochud-Allemann N. Schneider A. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 32849-32854Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar) showed, by RNAi inactivation of succinyl-CoA synthetase expression, that mitochondrial substrate level phosphorylation is essential for growth of the parasite (20.Bochud-Allemann N. Schneider A. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 32849-32854Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar). Second, we showed that the excreted succinate is produced by a glycosomal NADH-dependent fumarate reductase, which together with the glycosomal malate dehydrogenase, is involved in the maintenance of the glycosomal redox balance (21.Besteiro S. Biran M. Biteau N. Coustou V. Baltz T. Canioni P. Bringaud F. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 38001-38012Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar). Furthermore, in the course of this analysis, we detected a significant PYK activity in the cytosol of the T. brucei procyclic form (21.Besteiro S. Biran M. Biteau N. Coustou V. Baltz T. Canioni P. Bringaud F. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 38001-38012Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar) (PYK activity was previously considered as negligible (12.Fairlamb A.H. Opperdoes F.R. Morgan M.J. Carbohydrate Metabolism in Cultured Cells. Plenum Publishing Corp., New York1986: 183-224Crossref Google Scholar)). Therefore, we proposed that pyruvate is produced by the cytosolic PYK (21.Besteiro S. Biran M. Biteau N. Coustou V. Baltz T. Canioni P. Bringaud F. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 38001-38012Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar) and probably the glycosomal pyruvate phosphate dikinase (PPDK) (22.Bringaud F. Baltz D. Baltz T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 7963-7968Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar), instead of the cytosolic malic enzyme (12.Fairlamb A.H. Opperdoes F.R. Morgan M.J. Carbohydrate Metabolism in Cultured Cells. Plenum Publishing Corp., New York1986: 183-224Crossref Google Scholar) (Fig. 1). Finally, Van Weelden et al. (23.Van Weelden S.W. Fast B. Vogt A. Van Der Meer P. Saas J. Van Hellemond J.J. Tielens A.G. Boshart M. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 12854-12863Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar) showed that the tricarboxylic acid cycle enzyme aconitase is not essential for growth and that the acetyl-CoA produced by glycolysis is not metabolized through the tricarboxylic acid cycle (23.Van Weelden S.W. Fast B. Vogt A. Van Der Meer P. Saas J. Van Hellemond J.J. Tielens A.G. Boshart M. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 12854-12863Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar). Here we add another important piece to the jigsaw puzzle of energy metabolism in procyclic T. brucei by investigating the role of PYK, PPDK, and oxidative phosphorylation in the generation of ATP in these cells. It has been well established that CHME-5 human microglia cells depend on oxidative phosphorylation for ATP production (24.Macouillard-de Poulletier G. Belaud-Rotureau M.A. Voisin P. Leducq N. Belloc F. Canioni P. Diolez P. Cytometry. 1998; 33: 333-339Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar), thus we compared some of the metabolic characteristics of these cells to those of procyclic T. brucei. We observed that oxidative phosphorylation is used, but is not essential for parasite growth, suggesting that it is not the main pathway to produce ATP, under the growth conditions used. Inactivation of PYK expression, by RNA interference, was shown to be lethal for the cells and several lines of evidence indicate that PYK is essential for its ATP production. This clearly shows that cytosolic substrate level phosphorylation is essential for growth of the procyclic form of T. brucei. Cell Cultures—The human microglial cell line CHME-5 was cultured as a monolayer in 100-mm diameter Petri dishes, in minimal essential medium, supplemented with 20 mm glucose, 4 mm glutamine, 45 mm sodium carbonate, penicillin (100 units·ml-1), streptomycin (0.1 mg· ml-1), and 10% heat-inactivated fetal calf serum (24.Macouillard-de Poulletier G. Belaud-Rotureau M.A. Voisin P. Leducq N. Belloc F. Canioni P. Diolez P. Cytometry. 1998; 33: 333-339Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). Cultures were carried out for 5 days in a water-saturated incubator with a 9% CO2 atmosphere. For the respiratory experiments microglia growth was performed on collagen beads (Cultispher-GL, Percell Biolytica AB, Sweden). The cell suspension and the beads were mixed at least 24 h before the test, at a ratio of 3–5 × 106 cells per ml of beads. The procyclic form of T. brucei EATRO1125 was cultured at 27 °C in SDM-79 medium containing 10% (v/v) heat-inactivated fetal calf serum and 3.5 mg·ml-1 hemin (SDM-79/FCS) (25.Brun R. Schonenberger M. Acta Trop. 1979; 36: 289-292PubMed Google Scholar). Alternatively, cells were grown in a modified version of the SDM-79/FCS medium, containing 1.6 mml-glutamine, 4 mm pyruvate, 11 mmd-glucose, and 8 mml-threonine. Inactivation of the ppdk Gene by Gene Knockout—To construct the pΔ1ppdk plasmids, the DNA fragments flanking the hygromycin resistance gene and the T7 RNA polymerase gene of the pHD328 plasmid (26.Wirtz E. Hartmann C. Clayton C. Nucleic Acids Res. 1994; 22: 3887-3894Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar) were replaced by the 5′- and 3′-untranslated regions flanking the ppdk gene (5′- and 3′-UTR) (Fig. 2). The 5′-UTR fragment (616 bp) was generated by PCR using as primers the ppdk-5′5′ (5′-ATGCGGGCGGCCGCCAAGCCACATGCAGAAAA-3′; the NotI restriction site is underlined) and ppdk-3′5′ (5′-CACTTTGCGCGctcgagTGTGTATAGTGGATGCTG-3′; the BssHII and XhoI restriction sites are underlined and in lower cases, respectively) oligonucleotides and as template the Cos8 cosmid, which contains the cloned ppdk gene and its flanking regions (22.Bringaud F. Baltz D. Baltz T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 7963-7968Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar). The NotI/BssHII-digested PCR fragment was cloned into the NotI/MluI-digested pHD328 plasmid (BssHII and MluI have compatible ends), to generate the pDH5′ plasmid. The 3′-UTR fragment (660 bp) was generated by PCR using as template the Cos8 cosmid and as primers the ppdk-5′3′ (5′-GCCAAGAGGCCTAAAGGACGTGGGAGGGGA-3′; the StuI restriction site is underlined) and ppdk-3′3′ (5′-CACTAAGCTAGCgcggccgcCGTGATTCTTTCACCCCGA-3′; the NheI and NotI restriction sites are underlined and in lower cases, respectively) oligonucleotides. The StuI/NheI-digested PCR fragment was cloned into StuI/NheI-digested pHD5′ plasmid to produce the pΔ1ppdk plasmid. The pΔ2ppdk plasmid was generated by replacing the XhoI/StuI fragment of the pΔ1ppdk plasmid, which encodes the hygromycin resistance gene and the T7 RNA polymerase gene, by the XhoI/StuI fragment of the pLew114 plasmid (27.Wirtz E. Leal S. Ochatt C. Cross G.A. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 1999; 99: 89-101Crossref PubMed Scopus (1126) Google Scholar), which encodes the neomycin resistance gene and the tetracycline repressor gene under the control of the T7 RNA polymerase promoter. The pΔ1ppdk and pΔ2ppdk plasmids were linearized by NotI prior to parasite transfection. The procyclic EATRO1125 strain was sequentially transfected with the NotI-digested pΔ1ppdk and pΔ2ppdk plasmids and selection of hygromycin-resistant and hygromycin/neomycin-resistant clones, respectively, was performed as previously reported (4.Bringaud F.

Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 14687-14692Crossref PubMed Scopus (609) Google Scholar), we generated in the pLew79 expression vector (kindly provided by E. Wirtz and G. A. M. Cross) (27.Wirtz E. Leal S. Ochatt C. Cross G.A. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 1999; 99: 89-101Crossref PubMed Scopus (1126) Google Scholar) a “sense/antisense” cassette that specifically targets the PYK gene (28.Allert S. Ernest I. Poliszczak A. Opperdoes F.R. Michels P.A. Eur. J. Biochem. 1991; 200: 19-27Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar) (Fig. 2). The 3′-end of the PYK gene was targeted, from position 1088 to 1519 bp (the ATG start and stop codons, of the PYK gene, are at positions 1 and 1500 bp, respectively) (28.Allert S. Ernest I. Poliszczak A. Opperdoes F.R. Michels P.A. Eur. J. Biochem. 1991; 200: 19-27Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). The plasmid construction was performed as previously described (4.Bringaud F. Robinson D.R. Barradeau S. Biteau N. Baltz D. Baltz T. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 2000; 111: 283-297Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar, 21.Besteiro S. Biran M. Biteau N. Coustou V. Baltz T. Canioni P. Bringaud F. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 38001-38012Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar). Briefly, a PCR-amplified 484 bp containing the antisense sequence (431 bp of targeted sequence plus 42 bp used as a spacer between the sense and antisense sequences) was inserted in the HindIII and BamHI restriction sites of the pLew79 plasmid. Then a PCR-amplified 442-bp fragment containing the sense sequence was inserted, upstream of the antisense sequence, in HindIII and XhoI restriction sites (XhoI was introduced at the 3′ extremity of the antisense PCR fragment). The resulting plasmid, pLew79-ΔPYK, contained a chimeric construct composed of the sense and antisense version of a PYK gene fragment, separated by a 42-bp fragment, under the control of the tetracycline-inducible procyclin (PARP) promoter (27.Wirtz E. Leal S. Ochatt C. Cross G.A. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 1999; 99: 89-101Crossref PubMed Scopus (1126) Google Scholar) (Fig. 2). The procyclic EATRO1125.T7T and Δ1.2ppdk cell lines, which express the tetracycline repressor (4.Bringaud F. Robinson D.R. Barradeau S. Biteau N. Baltz D. Baltz T. Mol. Biochem.

Parasitol. 1999; 99: 89-101Crossref PubMed Scopus (1126) Google Scholar), were transfected with the NotI-digested pLew79-ΔPYK plasmid and selection of phleomycin-resistant cells was performed as previously reported (4.Bringaud F.

Western Blot Analysis—Total protein extracts of the procyclic form of T. brucei (107 cells) were separated by SDS-PAGE (8%) and immunoblotted on Immobilon-P filters (Millipore) (29.Harlow E. Lane D. Antibodies: A Laboratory Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1988Google Scholar). Immunodetection was performed as described (29.Harlow E. Lane D. Antibodies: A Laboratory Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1988Google Scholar, 30.Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual, 2nd Ed.

Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR) Experiments—4 × 109T. brucei procyclic cells were collected by centrifugation at 1,400 × g for 10 min, washed once in PBS buffer, and incubated in 10 ml of incubation buffer (PBS buffer supplemented with 24 mm NaHCO3, pH 7.3) containing 110 μmol of d-[1-13C]glucose (11 mm) for 90–180 min at 27 °C. d-Glucose concentration in the medium was determined with the d-glucose Trinder kit (Sigma). The integrity of the cells during the incubation was checked by microscopic observation. After centrifugation for 10 min at 1,400 × g, the supernatant was lyophilized, re-dissolved in 500 μl of D2O, and 15 μl of pure dioxane was added as an external reference.13C NMR spectra were collected at 125.77 MHz with a Bruker DPX500 spectrometer equipped with a 5-mm broad-band probe. Measurements were recorded at 25 °C under bilevel broad-band gated proton decoupling and D2O lock. Acquisition conditions were: 90° flip angle, 22,150 Hz spectral width, 64,000 memory size, and 21.5 s total recycle time. Measurements were performed overnight with 2,048 scans. Spectra were collected after a 1 Hz exponential line broadening. The specific 13C-enrichment of lactate (C3), acetate (C2), and succinate (C2 and C3) was determined from1H-observed/13C-edited NMR (1H/13C NMR) spectra acquired under13C-decoupling (32.Freeman R. Mareci T.H. Morris G.A. J. Magn. Reson. 1981; 42: 341-345Google Scholar, 33.Rothman D.L. Behar K.L. Hetherington H.P. den Hollander J.A. Bendall M.R. Petroff O.A. Shulman R.G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1985; 82: 1633-1637Crossref PubMed Scopus (204) Google Scholar). The sequence enabled the successive acquisitions of a first scan corresponding to a standard spin-echo experiment without any13C-excitation and a second scan involving a13C-inversion pulse. Subtraction of two alternate scans resulted in the editing of1H spins coupled to13C spins with a scalar coupling constant JCH = 127 Hz.13C-Decoupling during the acquisition collapsed the1H/13C-coupling to a single1H resonance. Flip angles for rectangular pulses were carefully calibrated on both radiofrequency channels before each experiment. The relaxation delay was 8 s for a nearly complete longitudinal relaxation. The fractional13C-enrichment at selected metabolite carbon positions was calculated as the ratio of the area of a given resonance in the1H/13C NMR spectrum to its area in the standard spin-echo spectrum. The relative errors in the13C-enrichment determinations were <5%. 3M. Biran and P. Canioni, unpublished data. The amount of excreted products was calculated on the basis of the specific13C-enrichment values and the carbon-13 content for each metabolite at the position of interest, using the13C-enriched C1 glucose as quantitative reference. Enzymatic Assays—Sonicated (5 s at 4 °C) crude extracts of trypanosomes resuspended in cold hypotonic buffer (10 mm potassium phosphate, pH 7.8) were tested for enzymatic activities. PYK (34.Callens M. Opperdoes F.R. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 1992; 50: 235-243Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar) and glycerol-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GPDH) (31.Denise H. Giroud C. Barrett M.P. Baltz T. Eur. J. Biochem. 1999; 259: 339-346Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar) activities were measured at 340 nm via reduction of NAD+ or oxidation of NADH, respectively, according to published procedures. The PYK activity was measured in the presence of its activator (fructose 2,6-bisphosphate) to increase the sensitivity of the assay, as described (34.Callens M. Opperdoes F.R. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 1992; 50: 235-243Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). Determination of Metabolite Concentrations—The intracellular ATP, PEP, and/or pyruvate concentrations were determined on established procyclic cells in mid-log growth phase or CHME-5 human microglial cells grown on microbeads. Cell pellets (1–2 × 108 procyclic or 3–5 × 106 CHME-5 human microglial cells) were washed in cold PBS and frozen in liquid nitrogen. Lysis and deproteinization of the cellular pellets involved homogenization in 500 μl of cold perchloric acid (0.9 m) and neutralization (pH 6.5) by addition of KOH/MOPS (2/0.5 m). For ATP measurements, the firefly luciferase bioluminescence assay (“Quantitative ATP monitoring kit,” ThermoLabsystems) was used (35.Lemasters J.J. Hackenbrock C.R. Methods Enzymol. 1979; 56: 530-544Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). Pyruvate and PEP concentrations were determined by enzymatic conversion into l-lactate, with the oxidation of stochiometric amounts of NADH, as described before (36.Czok R. Lamprecht W. Bergmeyer H.U. Methods of Enzymatic Analysis. Vol. 3. Verlag Chemie/Academic Press, New York1974: 1585-1589Google Scholar). To determine the concentration of metabolites consumed or excreted by the EATRO1125 procyclic trypanosomes, the inoculum (106 cells· ml-1) was grown in the SDM-79/FCS medium containing 1.6 mml-glutamine, 4 mm pyruvate, 11 mmd-glucose, and 8 mml-threonine, until the stationary phase was reached. Aliquots of the growth medium were collected twice a day for the measurements. The quantity of d-glucose present in the medium was determined using the “glucose Trinder kit” (Sigma). Pyruvate concentration was determined enzymatically, as previously described (36.Czok R. Lamprecht W. Bergmeyer H.U. Methods of Enzymatic Analysis. Vol. 3. Verlag Chemie/Academic Press, New York1974: 1585-1589Google Scholar). The concentration of the 20 amino acids present in the medium was determined by chromatography on an automatic amino acid analyzer coupled to a computing integrator (Beckman), after deproteinization of the samples by perchloric acid treatment. Measurement of Oxygen Consumption—For oxygen consumption measurements, all cells were resuspended in their culture medium (including heat-inactivated fetal calf serum) at a density in the range of 1–2 × 106 cells·ml-1 (CHME-5 human microglial cells) or 0.5–2 × 108 cells·ml-1 (T. brucei procyclic form). Oxygen uptake was measured polarographically with a Clark type electrode (final volumes of 1 or 2 ml). Respiration rates were calculated with respect to calibration of the oxygen electrode with air-saturated medium containing 240 μm O2 at 25 °C (T. brucei procyclic form) or 220 μm O2 at 37 °C (CHME-5 human microglial cells). The effects of the addition of salicylhydroxamic acid (SHAM) (0.5 mm), KCN (1 mm), carbonyl cyanide m-chlorophenyl hydrazone (CCCP) (0.1 mm), and oligomycin (from 0.1 to 5 μg·ml-1) were tested. Oxidative Phosphorylation Is Not Essential for Procyclic Trypanosomes—To study the mitochondrial activity of procyclic T. brucei cells, we determined how oxygen consumption, ATP production, and cell growth were affected by effectors of mitochondrial metabolism (SHAM, KCN, CCCP, and oligomycin). This analysis was also performed on the CHME-5 human microglial cells, which depend on oxidative phosphorylation for ATP production (24.Macouillard-"

Although anti-viral therapy has appreciably reduced disease in transplant and AIDS patients, HCMV is still a significant problem in congenital disease and bone marrow transplant patients. In addition, HCMV has also been associated with long term diseases such as atherosclerosis, restenosis after angioplasty, chronic rejection after solid organ transplantation, and malignancies (1.Cobbs C.S.

The development of vascular disease involves a chronic inflammatory process with many contributing factors, and of these, chemokines and their receptors have been identified as key mediators. Interestingly, HCMV encodes a CXC chemokine (UL146), a potential CC chemokine (UL128), and four potential chemokine receptors (US27, US28, UL33, and UL78) with the most characterized being US28 (5.Akter P.

Chem. 1994; 269: 28539-28542Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and binds to a broad spectrum of chemokines including the CC chemokines RANTES, MCP-1, MCP-3, and MIP-1β and the CX3C chemokine Fractalkine/CX3CL1 (11.Kledal T.N.

Commun. 1995; 211: 325-330Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar). That CC chemokines fail to compete out Fractalkine binding suggests that Fractalkine binds to additional unique regions of US28 compared with the CC chemokines (11.Kledal T.N. Rosenkilde M.M. Schwartz T.W. FEBS Lett. 1998; 441: 209-214Crossref PubMed Scopus (169) Google Scholar). In 293 cells, RANTES binding to US28 activates ERK1/2 pathways through the G-proteins Gαi1 and Gα16 (13.Billstrom M.A. Johnson G.L. Avdi N.J. Worthen G.S. J. Virol. 1998; 72: 5535-5544Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). We have previously demonstrated that US28-mediated SMC migration also requires chemokine binding by either exogenously added RANTES or endogenously expressed MCP-1 (9.Streblow D.N.

Induction of US28-mediated SMC migration is not blocked by treatment with pertussis toxin, a Gαi/o inhibitor, suggesting that other G-proteins are involved in this event. In fact, we have recently determined that US28 couples with Gα12/13 to signal through RhoA. 2R. Melnychuk, unpublished results.2R. Melnychuk, unpublished results. This activity occurs in a ligand-dependent manner and is required for US28-mediated SMC migration. US28 has also been shown to exhibit constitutive signaling in COS-7 cells and human fibroblasts through both NF-κB and phospholipase C pathways via activation of Gq/11 G-proteins (14.Casarosa P.

Interestingly, Fractalkine binding to US28 as well as the US28 inverse agonist (VUF2274) but not CC chemokines antagonized constitutive signaling (15.Casarosa P. Menge W.M. Minisini R.

Sequences have been identified in the US28 cytoplasmic domain that mediate signaling as well as recycling from the plasma membrane (17.Waldhoer M. Casarosa P Rosenkilde M.M Smit M.J.

Together these data highlight the fact that there are ligand-dependent activities and cell type-specific effects occurring in US28 signaling. Lymphocyte migration induced by ligation of chemokine receptors is generally mediated through the Gαi class of heterotrimeric G-proteins (18.Bokoch G.M. Blood. 1995; 86: 1649-1660Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Upon GPCR stimulation, G-proteins bind directly to the receptor, exchanging GDP for GTP, causing dissociation of the Gα subunit from the Gβγ complex. Downstream effectors of the activated Gα subunit are specific for each type of Gα subunit and can include Ca+2 influx, cAMP, and phosphatidylinositol phosphate. The Gβγ heterodimer activates signaling cascades other than those stimulated by the Gα subunit, which can include the protein-tyrosine kinase (PTK) pathways (19.Inagami T. Eguchi S. Numaguchi K. Motley E.D. Tang H. Matsumoto T. Yamakawa T. J. Am. Soc. Nephrol. 1999; 10: 57-61PubMed Google Scholar). For example ligand binding to CCR2, CCR5, and CXCR1/2 induce cellular migration through the PTK pathway (20.Bacon K.B. Szabo M.C. Yssel H. Bolen J.B. Schall T.J. J. Exp.

Biochemistry. 2003; 42: 2874-2886Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). Activation of PTK(s) including that of focal adhesion kinase (FAK) is considered central for cellular migration. The importance of FAK in cellular migration was demonstrated by the inability of fibroblasts isolated from FAK–/– mice to migrate in response to stimuli (24.Ilic D. Furuta Y. Kanazawa S. Takeda N. Sobue K. Nakatsuji N. Nomura S. Fujimoto J. Okada M. Yamamoto T. Nature. 1995; 377: 539-544Crossref PubMed Scopus (1576) Google Scholar). In addition, overexpression of FAK was shown to enhance movement of CHO cells (25.Cary L.A. Chang J.F. Guan J.L. J. Cell Sci. 1996; 109: 1787-1794Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), and highly invasive tumors characteristically have heightened levels of FAK expression and activity (26.Kornberg L.J.

Cancer. 2002; 95: 2508-2515Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). FAK is comprised of a central kinase domain flanked on one side by an N-terminal FERM (erythrocyte band 4.1-ezrin-radixin-moesin) domain, which is involved in linking FAK to integrins and/or growth factor receptors (30.Sieg D.J. Hauck C.R. Ilic D. Klingbeil C.K. Schaefer E. Damsky C.H. Schlaepfer D.D. Nat. Cell Biol. 2000; 2: 249-256Crossref PubMed Scopus (1044) Google Scholar). The focal adhesion targeting domain is located C-terminal of the central kinase domain and is comprised of multiple protein-protein interaction motifs. The binding of paxillin and talin to the FAK-FAT domain facilitates a linkage to the cytoplasmic domain of integrins, which targets FAK to focal adhesions. FAK tyrosine phosphorylation after integrin or growth factor stimulation of cells is enhanced by its association with Src-family PTKs. This leads to the formation of a multiprotein signaling complex in which FAK serves as a scaffold. Mechanistically, after cell stimulation, FAK autophosphorylates at Tyr-397, resulting in the formation of an SH2 docking site. Src-family PTKs bind to FAK at Tyr-397, become activated, and trans-phosphorylate FAK at several other tyrosines including Tyr-925. The SH2 domain of the adaptor protein Grb2 binds to FAK Tyr-925 and forms a signaling complex that includes the nucleotide exchange factor Sos and the small GTP-binding protein Ras. This sequence of events contributes to the subsequent activation of ERK2/mitogen-activated protein kinase. Previously, we have reported that treatment of SMC with the PTK inhibitors genistein or herbimycin A blocked US28-induced cellular migration, suggesting that PTK activity is required for migration of these cells (9.Streblow D.N.

Here we demonstrate that US28 can signal through the non-receptor protein-tyrosine kinases Src and FAK and that this activity is required for the ability of US28 to mediate SMC migration. US28 activation of FAK occurs in a ligand-dependent manner, which is contrary to other reports suggesting that US28 may be constitutively active. In addition, we have determined critical regions of FAK that are required for US28-induced signaling and migration. These findings demonstrate that FAK and Src play integral roles in ligand-dependent, US28-mediated signaling associated with the induction of SMC migration.

The cells were co-infected with Ad-US28 and/or Ad-Trans at multiplicity of infection (m.o.i.) 500. After 16 h the cells were stimulated with RANTES (50 ng/ml) and then harvested at times 0 (unstimulated), 5, 10, and 15 min post-ligand addition. Cells were lysed in radioimmune precipitation assay buffer containing 1% Triton X-100, 1% sodium deoxycholate, and 0.1% SDS, and total FAK was immunoprecipitated using rabbit anti-FAK polyclonal serum and protein A/G-conjugated agarose beads (Santa Cruz). Precipitation reactions were washed 1 time in radioimmune precipitation assay buffer, 2 times in HNTG buffer (50 mm HEPES, 150 mm NaCl, 1% Triton, 10% glycerol, pH 7.4), and 2 times in kinase buffer (20 mm HEPES, 10 mm MgCl2, 10 mm MnCl2, 150 mm NaCl, 10% glycerol, pH 7.4) and then resuspended in kinase buffer plus [γ-32P]ATP. The kinase reaction was allowed to proceed for 15 min at 32 °C and then analyzed by SDS-PAGE and autoradiography. The blots were analyzed by Western blotting for the presence of FAK and Src. Immunoprecipitation Reactions—FAK–/– cells were plated in 10-cm culture dishes and serum-starved for 6 h upon 75% confluence. The cells were co-infected with Ad-Trans and/or Ad-US28 and/or Ad-FAK WT or FAK mutants at m.o.i. 50. After 16 h the cells were stimulated with RANTES (40 ng/ml) and then harvested at times 0 (unstimulated), 5, 10, 15, and 30 min post-ligand addition. Cells were lysed in radioimmune precipitation lysis buffer, total Grb2 was immunoprecipitated, and samples were analyzed by Western blotting using antibodies directed against Tyr(P). Co-precipitation of FAK-HA was demonstrated by stripping the blots in buffer containing 0.1 m Tris, pH 6.8, 1% SDS, and 1% 2-mercaptoethanol and staining using antibodies directed against HA. Before immune-complex reactions, a total of 50 μl of cellular lysate was assayed by SDS-PAGE/Western blotting for the presence of input US28 and FAK using antibodies directed against the HA tag present on both recombinant proteins. US28 co-immunoprecipitation reactions with Src were done as described above except that we used the FLAG-tagged version of US28, and the blots were probed with rabbit polyclonal antibodies directed against c-Src. SMC Migration Assay—Cell migration assays were performed as previously described (9.Streblow D.N. Söderberg-Nauclér C. Vieira J. Smith P. Wakabayashi E. Rutchi F. Mattison K. Altschuler Y. Nelson J.A. Cell. 1999; 99: 511-520Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (350) Google Scholar). Briefly, cells were added to the upper well of a Transwell (12-mm diameter, 3.0-μm pore size, Costar Corning, Cambridge, MA) at 1 × 105 cells per well. Cells were serum-starved for 16–24 h. HCMV at m.o.i. 10 was added to the upper well for 2 h. After infection the inserts were washed and transferred to fresh 12-well plates. Cells migrating to the lower chamber were counted at 48–72 h post-infection using a Nikon TE300 microscope at magnification 10×. Experiments were done in at least triplicate wells. Ten random fields were read in each well. The average number of cells per well was determined by multiplying the average number of cells per 10× field by the number of fields per well. Mean and S.D. were calculated. PP2 (1–25 μm; Calbiochem) was added 4 h after infection with HCMV to determine the role of Src in HCMV-US28-mediated SMC migration. For SMC migration studies involving FAK dominant negative adenovirus constructs, SMC were infected with HCMV (m.o.i. 10) for 2 h followed by co-infection with Ad-Trans and Ad-FAK (WT, NT, Phe-397, Arg-454, or Pro-) at m.o.i. of 1000 for an additional 2 h. Subsequently, the Transwell were transferred to fresh 12-well plates. Cellular migration was determined as described above. Recombinant protein levels were monitored by Western blotting and equalized by adjusting the adenoviral vector m.o.i. Adenovirus Construction—Adenoviruses expressing US28-FLAG were previously described (9.Streblow D.N. Söderberg-Nauclér C. Vieira J. Smith P. Wakabayashi E. Rutchi F. Mattison K. Altschuler Y. Nelson J.A. Cell. 1999; 99: 511-520Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (350) Google Scholar). Adenovirus vectors expressing US28 with an N-terminal HA tag were constructed by subcloning the DNA fragment (14.Casarosa P. Bakker R.A. Verzijl D. Navis M. Timmerman H. Leurs R. Smit M.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 1133-1137Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (198) Google Scholar) into pAdTet7. This vector contains the tet-responsive enhancer within a minimal CMV promoter followed by the SV40 late poly(A) cassette, adenovirus E1A, and a single loxP site to increase recombination frequency. Recombinant adenoviruses were produced by pAdUS28-HA or pAdFAK (WT, NT, Pro, R454K, Phe-397) construct co-transfection of 293 cells expressing the Cre recombinase with adenovirus DNA (Ad5-ψ5) that contains an E1A/E3-deleted adenovirus genome (32.Hsia D.A. Mitra S.K. Hauck C.R. Streblow D.N. Nelson J.A. Ilic D. Huang S. Li E. Nemerow G.R. Leng J. Spencer K.S. Cheresh D.A. Schlaepfer D.D. J. Cell Biol. 2003; 160: 753-767Crossref PubMed Scopus (454) Google Scholar). Recombinant adenoviruses were expanded on 293-Cre cells, and the bulk stocks were titered on 293 cells by limiting dilution. FAK and US28 expression were driven by co-infection with Ad-Trans expressing the Tet-off transactivator as previously described (9.Streblow D.N. Söderberg-Nauclér C. Vieira J. Smith P. Wakabayashi E. Rutchi F. Mattison K. Altschuler Y. Nelson J.A. Cell. 1999; 99: 511-520Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (350) Google Scholar). Immunocytochemistry—FAK–/– fibroblasts were grown in 0.1% gelatin-coated 4-well chamber slides (Nalge-Nunc). US28 and/or FAK was expressed using the adenovirus vectors described above. The cells were washed in phosphate-buffered saline, fixed in phosphate-buffered 1% paraformaldehyde for 10 min at room temperature, permeabilized, and blocked with 0.3% Triton X-100 in phosphate-buffered saline with 10% fetal calf serum and 0.1% sodium azide. Thereafter, the cells were incubated with antibodies against US28-FLAG epitope or FAK-HA epitope or FAK-c-Myc epitope (FAK-NT mutant only) in a 1:200 dilution for 1 h at room temperature. Cells were washed three times in phosphate-buffered saline, and binding of the primary antibody was detected with a fluorescein isothiocyanate tetramethyl-conjugated goat anti-mouse or rhodamine-conjugated goat anti-rabbit antibody for 1 h at room temperature. At this time the cells were also stained for actin using phalloidin (Molecular Probes, Eugene, OR) to monitor alterations in cellular actin cytoskeleton induced by US28 and FAK. Fluorescence-positive cells were visualized on an inverted Nikon fluorescent microscope. US28 Activation of FAK and Src Is Ligand-dependent—We have previously demonstrated that the HCMV-encoded chemokine receptor US28 mediates arterial SMC migration (9.Streblow D.N. Söderberg-Nauclér C. Vieira J. Smith P. Wakabayashi E. Rutchi F. Mattison K. Altschuler Y. Nelson J.A. Cell. 1999; 99: 511-520Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (350) Google Scholar). Migration occurred in a ligand-dependent manner that was sensitive to PTK inhibitors, suggesting a role for PTK activation in US28-mediated SMC migration. FAK is a non-receptor PTK with critical importance in facilitating cellular migration. To determine whether FAK plays a role in US28-mediated SMC migration, we first determined whether US28 ligation with RANTES promoted the activation of FAK. For these experiments, we performed in vitro kinase assays on FAK immunoprecipitation reactions. Adenovirus vectors were used to express HCMV-US28 in PAT1 SMC using methods that have been previously described (9.Streblow D.N. Söderberg-Nauclér C. Vieira J. Smith P. Wakabayashi E. Rutchi F. Mattison K. Altschuler Y. Nelson J.A. Cell. 1999; 99: 511-520Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (350) Google Scholar). Serum-starved US28-expressing PAT1 cells were untreated (0 time point) or treated with 50 ng/ml RANTES and harvested at 5, 10, or 15 min after the addition of ligand. Total cellular FAK was immunoprecipitated, and the samples were subjected to in vitro kinase assays and examined by SDS-PAGE and autoradiography. RANTES binding to US28 promoted the formation of a FAK·Src kinase complex by 5 min post-addition of ligand, and this activity was maximal at 10 min. FAK·Src kinase activity was reduced by 15 min, suggesting that the complex is transient (Fig. 1). PAT1 cells not expressing US28 failed to promote the FAK·Src kinase complex in the presence of RANTES (data not shown). Untreated US28-expressing PAT1 cells (0 time point) failed to activate the FAK·Src kinase complex, suggesting that this event is not due to an inherent constitutive signaling property of US28 but, rather, requires ligand binding. Western blotting using antibodies directed against FAK showed equal FAK protein levels for each immunoprecipitated sample, and antibodies directed against Src confirmed the association of this protein-tyrosine kinase with FAK (Fig. 1). Interestingly, an additional ∼47-kDa protein was co-immunoprecipitated with the FAK·Src complex, and this protein was highly phosphorylated, suggesting that RANTES binding to US28 facilitates the formation of a FAK and Src kinase complex, which includes additional signaling molecules. US28 Forms a Protein Complex with Src—Previously we demonstrated that US28-mediated SMC migration is blocked by treatment with the pan-PTK inhibitors genistein and herbimycin A (9.Streblow D.N. Söderberg-Nauclér C. Vieira J. Smith P. Wakabayashi E. Rutchi F. Mattison K. Altschuler Y. Nelson J.A. Cell. 1999; 99: 511-520Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (350) Google Scholar). Above we show that US28 activates a FAK·Src kinase complex, suggesting that Src plays an important role in US28/FAK signaling. To determine whether Src activity was required for US28-mediated SMC migration, we performed migration assays in the presence of increasing concentrations of PP2. As shown in Fig. 2A, treatment of SMC expressing US28 with PP2 resulted in near total inhibition of cellular migration, which occurred in a dose-dependent manner. We next examined the mechanism involved in US28 activation of Src. We next determined whether US28 complexes with Src by co-immunoprecipitation assays using antibodies directed against the FLAG epitope-tagged version of US28. As shown in Fig. 2B, antibodies directed against US28-FLAG co-precipitated Src upon the addition of RANTES. The complex is formed by 2.5 min after stimulation and is maximal between 2.5 and 5 min. The US28 association with Src returns to near background levels by 10 min (Fig. 2B). The kinetics of Src/US28 association are similar to those observed for Src/β2-adrenergic receptor binding after the addition of ligand (33.Luttrell L.M. Ferguson S.S. Daaka Y. Miller W.E. Maudsley S. Della Rocca G.J. Lin F. Kawakatsu H. Owada K. Luttrell D.K. Caron M.G. Lefkowitz R.J. Science. 1999; 283: 655-661Crossref PubMed Scopus (1234) Google Scholar). These findings suggest that US28 either binds directly to Src or the interaction is mediated through binding to other proteins like β-arrestin, as occurs with the β2-adrenergic receptor. US28 Mediates the Association of FAK with Adaptor Proteins in a Ligand-dependent Manner—Upon cellular activation by extracellular matrix proteins, Src phosphorylates FAK at multiple protein binding sites and increases the ability of FAK to bind adaptor proteins includ"
https://openalex.org/W2063643225,"The YidC/Oxa1/Alb3 family of proteins catalyzes membrane protein insertion in bacteria, mitochondria, and chloroplasts. In this study, we investigated which regions of the bacterial YidC protein are important for its function in membrane protein biogenesis. In Escherichia coli, YidC spans the membrane six times, with a large 319-residue periplasmic domain following the first transmembrane domain. We found that this large periplasmic domain is not required for YidC function and that the residues in the exposed hydrophilic loops or C-terminal tail are not critical for YidC activity. Rather, the five C-terminal transmembrane segments that contain the three consensus sequences in the YidC/Oxa1/Alb3 family are important for its function. However, by systematically replacing all the residues in transmembrane segment (TM) 2, TM3, and TM6 with serine and by swapping TM4 and TM5 with unrelated transmembrane segments, we show that the precise sequence of these transmembrane regions is not essential for in vivo YidC activity. Single serine mutations in TM2, TM3, and TM6 impaired the membrane insertion of the Sec-independent procoat-leader peptidase protein. We propose that the five C-terminal transmembrane segments of YidC function as a platform for the translocating substrate protein to support its insertion into the membrane.

We propose that the five C-terminal transmembrane segments of YidC function as a platform for the translocating substrate protein to support its insertion into the membrane. In prokaryotes and eukaryotes, the YidC/Oxa1/Alb3 family of proteins mediates membrane protein insertion. In bacteria, YidC mediates the membrane insertion of a number of proteins (for review, see Refs. 1.de Gier J.-W. Luirink J. Mol.

Hoppe-Seyler. 2002; 383: 1565-1572Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). YidC has been found associated with the SecYEGDF-YajC complex and to interact with Sec-dependent membrane proteins during membrane insertion (3.Scotti P.A. Urbanus M.L.

However, Escherichia coli depleted of YidC is mildly defective in the insertion of Sec-dependent membrane proteins (6.Samuelson J.C. Chen M. Jiang F. Moller I. Wiedmann M. Kuhn A. Phillips G.J.

These Sec-independent proteins were previously thought not to require a proteinaceous factor (10.Geller B.L. Wickner W. J. Biol. Chem. 1985; 260: 13281-13285Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 11.Kiefer D. Kuhn A. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 6299-6306Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar, 12.Ridder A.N. Morein S.

Similarly, in mitochondria, Oxa1 is required for the insertion of a subset of proteins that are inserted into the mitochondrial inner membrane from the matrix compartment (13.Hell K. Herrmann J. Pratje E. Neupert W. Stuart R.A. FEBS Lett. 1997; 418: 367-370Crossref PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar, 14.Hell K. Herrmann J.M. Pratje E. Neupert W. Stuart R.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

These inner membrane proteins include both mitochondrial encoded proteins that are synthesized in the matrix and nuclear encoded proteins that are first imported into mitochondria from the cytoplasm (for review, see Ref. 16.Stuart R. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2002; 1592: 79-87Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). In chloroplasts, Alb3, the Oxa1 homolog, is needed for the insertion of certain light-harvesting chlorophyll-binding proteins into the thylakoid membrane (17.Moore M. Harrison M.S. Peterson E.C. Henry R. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 1529-1532Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (189) Google Scholar, 18.Woolhead C.A. Thompson S.J. Moore M. Tissier C. Mant A. Rodger A. Henry R. Robinson C. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 40841-40846Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). The membrane topology of the E. coli YidC protein is different from that of Oxa1 and Alb3. Unlike Oxa1 and Alb3, which span the membrane five times with an N-terminal luminal tail of 100 residues or less (19.Sundberg E. Slagter J.G. Fridborg I. Cleary S.P. Robinson C. Coupland G. Plant Cell. 1997; 9: 717-730PubMed Google Scholar), YidC spans the membrane six times and, following the first transmembrane region, has a large N-terminal domain of 319 residues in the periplasm (see Fig. 1) (20.Saaf A. Monne M. de Gier J.-W. von Heijne G. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 30415-30418Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). The second, third, fifth, and sixth membrane-spanning regions of YidC contain conserved residues in the YidC/Oxa1/Alb3 family (21.Yen M.R. Harley K.T. Tseng Y.H. Saier Jr., M.H. FEMS Microbiol. Lett. 2001; 204: 223-231Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In addition, cytoplasmic loop C1 and periplasmic loop P2 of E. coli YidC (see Fig. 1) contain conserved hydrophilic regions that have been proposed to be important for substrate recognition (21.Yen M.R. Harley K.T. Tseng Y.H. Saier Jr., M.H. FEMS Microbiol. Lett. 2001; 204: 223-231Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). As a first step in defining the functional domains of E. coli YidC, we have mapped the regions of the protein that are important for YidC activity. We found that the large N-terminal periplasmic domain, periplasmic loops, and cytoplasmic regions of YidC are not directly involved in function, but that the five C-terminal transmembrane regions play an important role. This important role of the five transmembrane regions is consistent with sequence alignment analysis of the Oxa1 family members, which almost all have five transmembrane segments (21.Yen M.R. Harley K.T. Tseng Y.H. Saier Jr., M.H. FEMS Microbiol. Lett. 2001; 204: 223-231Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In particular, we identified six YidC single serine substitution mutants in the transmembrane regions that had impaired activity in the membrane insertion of procoat-leader peptidase protein. We propose that the C-terminal transmembrane segments of YidC function as a platform or framework in membrane protein insertion. Strains and Plasmids—E. coli strain JS7131 (MC1060, ΔyidC, attB::R6Kori, ParaBADyidC+ (Specr)) was constructed in our laboratory as described previously (6.Samuelson J.C. Chen M. Jiang F. Moller I. Wiedmann M. Kuhn A. Phillips G.J. Dalbey R.E. Nature. 2000; 406: 637-641Crossref PubMed Scopus (428) Google Scholar). Plasmid pMS119, containing the tac promoter and lacIq, was used to overproduce the M13 procoat protein with a leader peptidase domain (the last 103 residues of leader peptidase) attached to the C terminus (PC-Lep). 1The abbreviations used are: PC-LepM13 procoat protein with a leader peptidase domain (the last 103 residues of leader peptidase) attached to the C terminusTMtransmembrane segment. The yidC open reading frame, along with the 370-bp upstream region including the promoter and ribosome-binding site, was cloned into pACYC184, a low copy number plasmid from New England Biolabs Inc. The resulting pA-CYC184-yidC plasmid was then used to make all YidC mutants in this work. yidC contains a natural PstI (CTGCAG) site starting at the position corresponding to amino acid 147, and we introduced a second PstI site at codon 25 such that CTG encodes amino acid 25. Then, the PstI site at amino acid 147 was removed by a silent mutation, and another PstI site was added, with CTG codons introduced at amino acids 83, 214, 278, 323, and 332, respectively. The plasmids with the two PstI sites were digested with the PstI enzyme and then religated, yielding the yidC deletion mutants Δ25–83, Δ25–147, Δ25–214, Δ25–278, Δ25–323, and Δ25–332. For the other deletion mutants, oligonucleotide primers were designed complementary to the flanking regions of the deletion. To replace TM4 and TM5 of YidC with leader peptidases H1 and H2, a DNA fragment containing H1 or H2 was inserted into the yidC gene after the sequence coding for TM4 or TM5. Site-directed mutagenesis (Stratagene) was carried out to remove the extra part of leader peptidase. For all other yidC mutants, site-directed mutagenesis was used to replace the wild-type codons with the desired amino acid codons. M13 procoat protein with a leader peptidase domain (the last 103 residues of leader peptidase) attached to the C terminus transmembrane segment. Test of Complementation—Competent JS7131 cells were incubated on ice with the plasmids containing different yidC mutants for 15 min and heat-shocked at 37 °C for 3 min. Fresh LB medium was added and incubated at 37 °C for 30 min. The same amount of the culture was spread on LB plates with 0.2% arabinose or 0.2% glucose and incubated at 37 °C for 16–18 h. Cells that grew on both arabinose and glucose plates were recorded as “complementation-positive,” and cells that grew only on arabinose plates were recorded as “complementation-negative.” Signal Peptide Processing Assay—Strain JS7131 transformed with both pACYC184-yidCmutant and pMS119-PC-Lep was grown overnight in LB medium with 0.2% arabinose. After washing twice with fresh LB medium, the overnight cultures were back-diluted 1:50 into 1 ml of LB medium containing 0.2% glucose to repress the expression of wild-type chromosomal yidC. The cultures were grown at 37 °C for 3 h to deplete wild-type YidC. Typically, in these studies, A600 nm reached 0.4–0.7. The cells were then shifted to M9 minimal medium containing 0.2% glucose and grown for another 0.5 h. At this point, isopropyl-β-d-thiogalactopyranoside (final concentration of 1 mm) was added to the culture to induce the expression of PC-Lep. After 5 min, the cells were radiolabeled with trans-[35S]methionine for 20 s, and the radiolabeled samples were added to an equal volume of 20% ice-cold trichloroacetic acid. For the pulse-chase experiments, after 20 s of labeling, an aliquot of the sample was removed from the culture and added to ice-cold trichloroacetic acid. Nonradioactive methionine (final concentration of 500 μg/ml) was added to the rest of the culture. At 1 and 2 min, an aliquot of the chased sample was taken and added to chilled trichloroacetic acid. The samples were subjected to SDS-PAGE using a 15% polyacrylamide gel, and the radiolabeled proteins were detected by phosphorimaging. Detection of YidC Mutants by Immunoblot Assay—Strain JS7131 with the YidC mutants in the pACYC184 vector was grown overnight in LB medium containing 0.2% arabinose. After washing the cells with fresh LB medium twice, the overnight cultures were back-diluted 1:50 into 1 ml of LB medium with 0.2% glucose and grown to deplete wild-type YidC. After 2.5 h of growth, JS7131 cells producing the YidC mutants were pelleted and added to 2× SDS-PAGE loading dye. Samples were analyzed by SDS-PAGE using a 15% polyacrylamide gel. YidC proteins were detected by immunoblotting using antiserum that was prepared against the C terminus of YidC and the ECL Western blot detection kit (Amersham Biosciences). In Vivo Assay of YidC Activity—To examine the activity of the YidC mutants, we used two approaches. Both approaches took advantage of the arabinose-dependent JS7131 strain, which has the yidC gene under the control of the araBAD promoter (6.Samuelson J.C. Chen M. Jiang F. Moller I. Wiedmann M. Kuhn A. Phillips G.J. Dalbey R.E. Nature. 2000; 406: 637-641Crossref PubMed Scopus (428) Google Scholar). Growth of the JS7131 strain is strictly arabinose-dependent, i.e. growth on LB medium supplemented with arabinose is normal, but not on LB medium with glucose. In the first approach, we cloned the YidC mutants into pACYC184 under the control of the endogenous promoter of yidC and investigated whether the mutant YidC protein could complement the growth defect of the YidC depletion strain when the cells were grown on glucose. In the second approach, we transformed the JS7131 strain with pMS119 encoding the PC-Lep gene and with the pACYC184 plasmid containing each yidC mutant. There are two reasons for choosing PC-Lep as the model protein to test the membrane insertion function of the YidC mutants. One is that PC-Lep insertion is strictly dependent on YidC (8.Samuelson J.C. Jiang F. Yi L. Chen M. de Gier J.-W. Kuhn A. Dalbey R.E. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 34847-34852Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar). The other reason is that the PC-Lep insertion can be easily detected using the leader peptidase processing assay, allowing us to test a large number of YidC mutants. It should be noted that we verified the identities of the precursor and mature forms of PC-Lep bands by +/– induction and by immunoprecipitation (data not shown). The PC-Lep bands were easily visualized because the protein is highly expressed in the pMS119 vector and because there were no other highly expressed proteins at the same position on the SDS-polyacrylamide gel. Using the two-plasmid system, we could measure the in vivo activity of the YidC mutant by examining PC-Lep processing after growing the cells in the presence of glucose for several generations, which results in repression of wild-type YidC synthesis. When the plasmid-encoded YidC mutant was inactive (see Fig. 3B, for example), PC-Lep was inhibited in membrane insertion. In contrast, when strain JS7131 had a functional yidC gene on the plasmid, we found that PC-Lep was processed in cells growing on glucose. Therefore, the activity of YidC mutants could be measured when strain JS7131 was transformed with plasmids expressing different YidC mutants under conditions in which the arabinose-inducible chromosomal YidC was not expressed. YidC Is Still Functional When Most of the Large N-terminal Periplasmic Domain Is Deleted—Because the YidC homologs in mitochondria and chloroplasts as well as in many bacteria have much shorter luminal domains (1.de Gier J.-W. Luirink J. Mol. Microbiol. 2001; 40: 314-322Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar, 21.Yen M.R. Harley K.T. Tseng Y.H. Saier Jr., M.H. FEMS Microbiol. Lett. 2001; 204: 223-231Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), we investigated whether the large periplasmic domain of YidC (loop P1) (Fig. 1) is required for activity. To address this question, we made a series of periplasmic domain deletion mutants: Δ25–83, Δ25–147, Δ25–214, Δ25–278, Δ25–323, and Δ25–332 (the numbers in the mutant names indicate the positions of amino acid residues in YidC) (Fig. 2A). Immunoblot analysis using anti-YidC antiserum prepared against a C-terminal peptide was performed to examine the size and expression of the YidC deletion mutants (Fig. 2B). As expected, as the deletions became bigger, the expressed YidC mutant proteins decreased in size. Proteolytic fragments of YidC were evident for the Δ25–83 and Δ25–147 mutants. However, no obvious expressed protein was evident for the Δ25–332 mutant; this YidC mutant may overlap with the background band, or it is poorly expressed. Fig. 3 shows that most of periplasmic loop P1 could be deleted without a detrimental effect on YidC function. Except for the largest deletion (Δ25–332), all the loop P1 deletion mutants complemented the YidC depletion strain (Fig. 3A) and stimulated the insertion of PC-Lep when wild-type yidC controlled by araBAD was not expressed (Fig. 3B). Even the Δ25–323 mutant was functional in E. coli, showing that 92% of the periplasmic domain is dispensable for function. The results of this deletion analysis show that YidC mutants were active with deletions up to amino acid 323, but lost activity when the deletion was increased beyond residue 323. In these studies, we were initially concerned that when a positive complementation was observed, it could be due to higher expression of the YidC construct because these proteins are expressed by a plasmid. However, the expression of these YidC derivatives by the low copy plasmid pACYC184 was similar to that of wild-type YidC by the araBAD promoter in the JS7131 strain (see Fig. 2B). Previously, we showed that the amount of YidC in the JS7131 strain grown in arabinose medium is approximately the same as that of wild-type YidC in the parent E. coli strain MC1060 (6.Samuelson J.C. Chen M. Jiang F. Moller I. Wiedmann M. Kuhn A. Phillips G.J. Dalbey R.E. Nature. 2000; 406: 637-641Crossref PubMed Scopus (428) Google Scholar). To determine whether a specific sequence between residues 324 and 342 in periplasmic loop P1 is necessary for YidC activity, we used alanine scanning mutagenesis. Remarkably, all the Ala mutants were active (Fig. 4), showing that there are no essential residues in the remaining 18 residues of the YidC periplasmic domain. The results emphasize that the periplasmic domain is not critical per se for YidC function in E. coli. The Other Hydrophilic Loops and the C-terminal Tail Do Not Contain Residues That Are Important for Substrate Binding or Catalysis—Recently, it has been proposed that, in the Oxa1 family of proteins, there are conserved hydrophilic regions that may play a role in substrate recognition (21.Yen M.R. Harley K.T. Tseng Y.H. Saier Jr., M.H. FEMS Microbiol. Lett. 2001; 204: 223-231Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Two of these conserved hydrophilic regions are located in cytosolic loop C1 between TM2 and TM3, and the third conserved hydrophilic region is located in periplasmic loop P2 between TM3 and TM4 of E. coli YidC (Fig. 1). To test whether the hydrophilic regions contain important information for substrate recognition, we deleted these regions as well as the other hydrophilic domains in the protein. We found that deletion of the entire cytoplasmic loop C1 (residues 371–416; ΔLoopC1) and cytosolic loop C2 (residues 482–493; ΔLoopC2) had no effect on YidC activity. First, both ΔLoopC1 and ΔLoopC2 complemented the YidC depletion strain (Fig. 5A); and second, they stimulated the insertion of PC-Lep (Fig. 5B), as PC-Lep was converted to the mature form. Similarly, deletion of the short cytoplasmic C-terminal tail (residues 535–548; ΔC) had no significant effect on YidC function (Fig. 5). In contrast, deletion of periplasmic loop P2 (residues 447–463; ΔLoopP2) inactivated the protein. No processing of PC-Lep was observed for this mutant. Because the deletion could inactivate the protein due to a structural change, we used a second approach involving alanine scanning mutagenesis. Four alanine mutants were made in periplasmic loop P2 to test whether the residues in this loop are critical for YidC function (Fig. 5). All the Ala mutants were active in vivo. They complemented the growth defect of the YidC depletion strain and stimulated the membrane insertion of PC-Lep (Fig. 5). These results demonstrate that if periplasmic loop P2 plays a role in substrate binding, then this domain does not require a precise sequence for substrate recognition. Finally, deletion analysis and alanine scanning mutagenesis were performed on periplasmic loop P3 (residues 510–512; ΔLoopP3) (Fig. 5). Although deletion of the loop impaired processing of PC-Lep and prevented the YidC mutant from complementing the YidC depletion strain, the loop did not contain any residues essential for activity of YidC; this short loop could be functionally replaced by polyalanine (Fig. 5). The Five C-terminal Transmembrane Segments Are Critical for YidC Activity—Because almost all YidC homologs have five transmembrane segments (21.Yen M.R. Harley K.T. Tseng Y.H. Saier Jr., M.H. FEMS Microbiol. Lett. 2001; 204: 223-231Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), deletion analysis was performed to test the importance of the five C-terminal transmembrane segments for YidC function. We reported previously that YidC is still functional when TM1 is replaced with a cleavable signal peptide (22.Jiang F. Yi L. Moore M. Chen M. Rohl T. Van Wijk K.J. de Gier J.-W. Henry R. Dalbey R.E. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 19281-19288Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). This suggests that TM1 of YidC functions as an uncleaved signal sequence and is important for membrane insertion of YidC, but not for YidC activity. We now investigated whether the other five transmembrane segments are important for YidC activity. Three deletion mutants were initially made (Fig. 6A). First, TM6 was deleted along with the cytoplasmic tail (ΔTM6C). Second, TM5 and TM6 were deleted (ΔTM5+6). Third, TM3 and TM4 (including loop P2) were deleted (ΔTM3+4). All these mutants were inactive; no complementation was observed (Fig. 6A), and they were not capable of stimulating PC-Lep membrane insertion (Fig. 6B). In addition, a small deletion in TM2 or TM3 was made (ΔTM2 has WGFSIII deleted, and ΔTM3 has VNPLGGCF deleted). Also these deletions inactivated YidC, indicating that TM2 and TM3 are important for YidC activity. To confirm that the complementation-negative YidC deletion constructs were expressed, we examined the YidC intracellular levels by immunoblotting. The JS7131 strain was transformed with the YidC constructs and grown in either arabinose medium to express wild-type YidC or glucose to reduce the levels of the wild-type protein. As a control, strain JS7131 with an empty vector was grown under the same conditions. As shown, wild-type YidC was completely depleted under glucose conditions. ΔTM2 and ΔTM3 were detected at the position of the wild-type protein under glucose conditions as the deletions are so small (seven residues for ΔTM2 and eight residues for ΔTM3), showing they were indeed expressed (Fig. 7). As expected, ΔTM3+4 and ΔTM5+6, with deletions of 65 and 42 residues, respectively, were detected on the SDS-polyacrylamide gel running at a molecular mass below that of the wild-type protein. This immunoblot study rules out that the deletions did not result in poor expression or instability of the YidC proteins. Nevertheless, the C-terminal transmembrane domains in YidC may be important for maintaining the overall structure of the protein or for correct membrane insertion of the YidC protein. These deletion studies show that, to maintain the function of YidC, the five C-terminal transmembrane segments need to be present. We therefore further investigated whether specific sequences in the five transmembrane domains are necessary for YidC function.Fig. 7Immunoblot analysis of the intracellular levels of the complementation-negative YidC constructs. Strain JS7131 expressing different YidC mutants in pACYC184 was grown overnight in LB medium with 0.2% arabinose. The overnight cultures were backdiluted 1:50 in 1 ml of LB medium with 0.2% arabinose or 0.2% glucose and grown for 2.5 h. The samples were then prepared and analyzed by immunoblotting as described in the legend of Fig. 2B. The positions of the ΔTM3+4 (*) and ΔTM5+6 (○) proteins on the gel are indicated. ΔTM2 and ΔTM3 ran at the same position as the full-length YidC protein.

Three consensus sequences were found. The first is in conserved TM2, the second in TM3, and the third in TM5 and TM6 of E. coli YidC. Because we found that TM5 can be replaced by an unrelated transmembrane segment (see below), we focused on the consensus sequences in TM2, TM3, and TM6.

First, serine scanning mutagenesis was performed. Typically, three or more serine residues were introduced consecutively into the transmembrane segments. Serine was chosen because most of the conserved residues are hydrophobic and reside in membrane-spanning regions. Therefore, the polar serine residue should allow the transmembrane region to insert into the membrane, whereas if the conserved residue or its hydrophobicity is critical for activity, the serine mutation should impair the activity of the mutant. The majority of the serine mutants in TM2 were functional (Table I). They complemented the YidC depletion strain and promoted the insertion of PC-Lep (Table I). Intriguingly, two of the YidC mutants in which serines were substituted for residues 343–345 or 361–365 were not functional (Table I). These serine mutants did not complement the growth defect of the YidC depletion strain and were defective in promoting membrane insertion of PC-Lep (Table I; see Fig. 8A for the S343–345 mutant). To test whether there is a critical residue in regions 343–345 and 361–365, single serine mutants were constructed. We found that the I361S mutant was not functional, suggesting that the residue is important for YidC function. The lack of activity of the I361S mutant is not due to lack of expression of the protein or to protein instability, as the I361S protein was detectable on a Western blot (Fig. 7). In contrast, no essential residue was found in region 343–345, as all th"

Hsp90 binds to the ligand binding domain (LBD) of the GR, which must be in heterocomplex with hsp90 for it to bind steroid (1.Pratt W.B. Toft D.O. Exp. Biol. Med. 2003; 228: 111-133Crossref PubMed Scopus (1249) Google Scholar). The steroids bind deep in a hydrophobic cleft that appears to be collapsed in the absence of ligand (11.Gee A.C. Katzenellenbogen J.A. Mol. Endocrinol. 2001; 15: 421-428Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar), and the hsp90/hsp70-based chaperone machinery opens the binding cleft of the GR LBD such that it can be accessed by steroid (Ref. 12.Murphy P.J.M. Morishima Y. Chen H. Galigniana M.D. Mansfield J.F. Simons Jr., S.S. Pratt W.B. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 34764-34773Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar and references therein). Because hsp90 is required for high affinity steroid binding in vivo, the generation of steroid binding activity by the five-protein system demonstrates that a physiologically appropriate folding change has occurred upon heterocomplex assembly in vitro. Among the five chaperones in the purified assembly system, we have determined that hsp90 and hsp70 are both essential for opening the steroid binding cleft in the GR LBD, and hsp40, Hop (hsp70/hsp90 organizing protein), and p23 act as cochaperones to increase the rate or extent of GR·hsp90 heterocomplex assembly (13.Morishima Y.

The cochaperones are much less abundant in cell lysates than the essential chaperones, and both Hop and hsp40 (we use the yeast ortholog YDJ-1) are optimally active in the five-protein assembly system when present at less than one-tenth the concentration of hsp70 and hsp90. In contrast, roughly stoichiometric levels of p23 are required for peak activity in the five-protein assembly system. Here, we investigate the consequences of increasing the concentration of each of the cochaperones on GR·hsp90 heterocomplex assembly in vivo in Sf9 cells.When a protein is overexpressed, there is always the possibility that so much of it is produced that it overwhelms the cellular protein folding systems required to generate the physiologically active state. This is the case with baculovirus-mediated expression of the GR in Sf9 cells. Alnemri and Litwack (14.Alnemri E.S. Litwack G. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 5387-5393Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar) showed that only a small fraction of the total expressed GR was present in the cytosolic fraction as GR·hsp90 heterocomplexes, and the majority of the receptor was present as insoluble aggregates, which did not form when a truncated GR lacking the LBD was expressed. Coexpression of the full-length GR with hsp90 or hsp70 did not increase formation of the steroid binding receptor heterocomplex, but incubation of GR partially purified from the aggregates with reticulocyte lysate resulted in reconstitution of GR·hsp90 heterocomplexes and restoration of full steroid binding activity (14.Alnemri E.S. Litwack G. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 5387-5393Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). This led to the conclusion that factors other than hsp90 and hsp70 are limiting in insect cells but can be supplied in vitro by reticulocyte lysate.Here we coexpress the GR in Sf9 cells with Hop, YDJ-1, or p23 and show that p23 is the limiting component of the hsp90/hsp70-based chaperone system. Increasing p23 increases the fraction of cytosolic receptors that are stably bound to hsp90, and p23 coexpression also eliminates the formation of receptor aggregates. These observations argue strongly that the effects of p23 expression on a client protein function must be interpreted in terms of the ability of p23 to enhance the activity of hsp90 as opposed to direct chaperone effects in which p23 interacts with a partially denatured protein to affect its folding state. From a protein engineering viewpoint, coexpression of p23 may prove to be very useful in the production of the physiologically regulated state of client proteins that normally are present in persistent heterocomplexes with hsp90.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESMaterialsUntreated rabbit reticulocyte lysate was purchased from Green Hectares (Oregon, WI).

The 1218-bp fragment was inserted into the multiple cloning site of the pFASTBAC vector with StuI to make pFB-YDJ-1.Overexpression of proteins in Sf9 cells was achieved according to the BAC-TO-BAC transfection kit protocol of Invitrogen. The pFB transfer vectors were transformed into DH10BAC competent cells containing the bacmid DNA and a helper plasmid. The pFASTBAC plasmid can then transpose with the bacmid by the transposition proteins on the helper plasmid. Colonies containing recombinant bacmids were identified by selection of blue/white colonies caused by disruption of the lacZα gene. The bacmid DNA was prepared and then transfected into Sf9 cells with CellFECTIN (Invitrogen) to make recombinant baculovirus according to the manufacturer's protocol.Expression of Proteins in Sf9 Cells—Sf9 cells were grown in Sf-900 II serum-free medium (Invitrogen) supplemented with Cytomax (Kemp Biotechnology, Rockville, MD) in suspension cultures with continuous shaking (150 rpm).

Cultures were supplemented with 0.1% glucose at infection and 24 h post-infection as described by Srinivasan et al. (19.Srinivasan G. Post J.F.M. Thompson E.B. J. Steroid Biochem. Mol. Biol. 1997; 60: 1-9Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). Cells were harvested after 48 h of infection, washed in Hanks' buffered saline solution, resuspended in 1.5 volumes of HEM buffer (10 mm Hepes, pH 7.5, 1 mm EDTA, 20 mm sodium molybdate) containing 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride and Complete Mini (Roche Applied Science) protease inhibitor mixture (1 tablet/7 ml), and ruptured by Dounce homogenization. The lysate was then centrifuged at 100,000 × g for 30 min at 4 °C and the supernatant was collected as the cytosolic fraction. In some experiments, aggregated GR in the 100,000 × g pellet was also assayed by immunoblotting. HEM buffer containing phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride was added to the pellet to the original volume of the lysate, and the pellet was suspended by vigorous Vortex mixing, prior to sonication for 1 min at a setting of 5 with 50% duty cycle. When pellets and cytosols were compared, the same volume of cytosolic and particulate fraction was loaded for gel electrophoresis and immunoblotting.GR·Hsp90 Heterocomplex Reconstitution—Receptors were immunoadsorbed from 50-μl aliquots of Sf9 cytosol by rotation for 2 h at 4 °C with 14 μl of protein A-Sepharose precoupled to 7 μl of FiGR ascites suspended in 200 μl of TEG buffer (10 mm TES, pH 7.6, 50 mm NaCl, 4 mm EDTA, 10% glycerol). Before incubation with reticulocyte lysate, immunoadsorbed receptors were stripped of associated hsp90 by incubating the immunopellet an additional 2 h at 4 °C with 350 μl of 0.5 m NaCl in TEG. The pellets were then washed once with 1 ml of TEG, followed by a second wash with 1 ml of Hepes buffer (10 mm Hepes, pH 7.4). FiGR immunopellets containing GR stripped of chaperones were incubated with 50 μl of rabbit reticulocyte lysate and 5 μl of an ATP-regenerating system (50 mm ATP, 250 mm creatine phosphate, 20 mm magnesium acetate, and 100 units/ml creatine phosphokinase). The assay mixtures were incubated for 20 min at 30 °C with suspension of the pellets by shaking of the tubes every 2 min. At the end of the incubation, the pellets were washed twice with 1 ml of ice-cold TEGM buffer (TEG with 20 mm sodium molybdate) and assayed for steroid binding capacity and receptor-associated proteins.Assay of Steroid Binding Capacity—Immune pellets to be assayed for steroid binding were incubated overnight at 4 °C in 50 μl of HEM buffer plus 50 nm [3H]dexamethasone. Samples were then washed three times with 1 ml of TEGM and counted by liquid scintillation spectrometry. The steroid binding is expressed as counts/min of [3H]dexamethasone bound/FiGR immunopellet prepared from 50 μl of cytosol. Steroid binding activity in Sf9 cytosol was assayed by incubating 100-μl aliquots of cytosol overnight with 50 nm [3H]dexamethasone in the presence or absence of competing non-radioactive dexamethasone. The incubations were mixed with 1.5 volumes of a dextran-coated charcoal suspension (1% charcoal and 0.2% dextran in 10 mm Hepes, pH 7.4) for 10 min at 0 °C. The radioactivity remaining in the charcoal supernatant was assayed, and specific binding was determined by subtracting radioactivity obtained in the presence of competing dexamethasone from that in its absence.Western Blotting—To assay GR and associated proteins, immune pellets were resolved on 12% SDS-polyacrylamide gels and transferred to Immobilon-P membranes. The membranes were probed with 0.25 μg/ml BuGR for GR, 1 μg/ml AC88 for rabbit hsp90, 0.05% rabbit antiserum for insect hsp70 and hsp90, 1 μg/ml N27F3-4 for rabbit hsp70, 0.1% DS14F5 mouse ascites for human Hop, 0.5% anti-hsp40 for YDJ-1 and rabbit hsp40, or 0.1% JJ3 mouse ascites for human p23. The immunoblots were then incubated a second time with the appropriate 125I-conjugated or horseradish peroxidase-conjugated counterantibody to visualize the immunoreactive bands.Protein Purification—Hsp90 and hsp70 were purified from rabbit reticulocyte lysate by sequential chromatography on DE52, hydroxylapatite, and ATP-agarose as described previously (4.Dittmar K.D. Hutchison K.A. Owens-Grillo J.K. Pratt W.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 12833-12839Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar). Human p23 (16.Johnson J.L. Toft D.O. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 24989-24993Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) was purified from 10 ml of bacterial lysate by chromatography on DE52, followed by hydroxylapatite chromatography as described (5.Dittmar K.D. Banach M. Galigniana M.D. Pratt W.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 7358-7366Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar). For purification of YDJ-1, bacterial sonicates were cleared by centrifugation, and YDJ-1 was purified by sequential chromatography on DE52 and hydroxylapatite as described previously (5.Dittmar K.D.

The bacterial expression of YDJ-1 has been described (18.Caplan A.J. Tsai J. Casey P.J. Douglas M.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 18890-18895Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) as has the expression of human Hop (4.Dittmar K.D. Hutchison K.A. Owens-Grillo J.K. Pratt W.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 12833-12839Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar). Purification of human Hop was carried out in a similar manner by sequential chromatography on DE52 and hydroxylapatite. In all cases, the protein-containing fractions were identified by immunoblotting, and fractions from the final purification step were pooled, concentrated by Amicon filtration, dialyzed against HKD buffer (10 mm Hepes, 100 mm KCl, 5 mm dithiothreitol, pH 7.35), flash frozen, and stored at –70 °C.Relative Abundance of Proteins in Reticulocyte Lysate—To determine the concentrations of the five proteins of the chaperone system in reticulocyte lysate, aliquots of reticulocyte lysate were electrophoresed on SDS-polyacrylamide gels that also contained various amounts of purified hsp90, hsp70, Hop, YDJ-1, and p23 to provide a standard curve for each protein. Immunoblots were prepared and probed with monoclonal IgGs against each protein, followed by incubation with 125I-labeled anti-IgG counterantibody. Samples and purified standards were then excised and counted to permit calculation of the concentration of each protein.Fractionation of Sf9 Cytosol—Sf9 cytosol (500 μl) was incubated overnight with 50 nm [3H]dexamethasone and then applied to a column (1.5 × 113 cm) of Sephacryl S-300. The column was eluted with HEM buffer, and 0.5-ml aliquots of each 2.75-ml fraction were assayed for radioactivity. Aliquots of 100 μl were assayed for GR and p23 by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and immunoblotting.RESULTSRelative Concentrations of the Assembly Proteins in Reticulocyte Lysate—Because some of our antibodies do not recognize the corresponding insect chaperones in Sf9 cytosol, the relative abundance of the five proteins of the chaperone machinery was assayed in rabbit reticulocyte lysate. Table I and Fig. 1A show the concentrations of each protein in reticulocyte lysate, and Table I presents a comparison with the optimal concentration of the protein in the purified five-protein assembly system. In reticulocyte lysate, the cochaperones Hop, hsp40, and p23 are present at only a fraction of the concentration of the essential chaperones. In the purified system, Hop and hsp40 are optimally active at similarly low molar ratios with respect to hsp90 and hsp70, but p23 is optimally active when it is present at roughly the same concentration as hsp90. Addition of purified hsp90, hsp70, Hop, or YDJ-1 to reticulocyte lysate does not enhance its ability to activate the GR to the steroid binding state, but addition of purified p23 yields a substantial increase in GR·hsp90 heterocomplexes with steroid binding activity (Fig. 1B). Maximum activation of GR steroid binding activity is achieved when 4–8 μg of p23 are added to the 50-μl incubation mixture (Fig. 1C), a concentration of p23 that is ∼10-fold higher than that in reticulocyte lysate.Table IConcentrations of molecular chaperones in reticulocyte lysate and purified five-protein systemProteinReticulocyte lysatePurified systemμg/50 μlμmμg/50 μlμmHsp90184.1204.4Hsp70246.9154.2Hop1.80.60.60.2Hsp40/YDJ-11.50.70.40.2p230.70.665.2 Open table in a new tab Effect of Coexpression of Each Cochaperone on GR Steroid Binding Activity in Sf9 Cytosols—Before beginning coexpression experiments, we expressed each of the cochaperones in Sf9 cells, purified them, and demonstrated that they had the same activity in the purified five-protein GR·hsp90 assembly assay as the bacterially expressed proteins (data not shown). Also, to minimize toxicity related to infection with too much baculovirus, the baculovirus for GR expression was titrated to determine the amount of virus just sufficient to produce the maximum amount of cytosolic GR in 48 h of infection. An m.o.i. of 0.1 was sufficient, and that amount of baculovirus was used in all of the experiments in this work.The effect of coexpression of each of the cochaperones on GR steroid binding activity in Sf9 cytosol is shown in Fig. 2. In Fig. 2A, it can be seen that p23 can be expressed in quite high levels without affecting the amount of GR, hsp90, or hsp70 in cytosol and without affecting steroid binding activity. Within the range of m.o.i. shown for YDJ-1 expression, there is a slight increase in steroid binding activity that is consistently seen at the lowest level of expression followed by a decrease in binding activity at higher levels of expression (Fig. 2B). Coexpression of Hop does not affect the amount of cytosolic GR, hsp90, or hsp70 or the level of steroid binding activity (Fig. 2C).Fig. 2Effect of cochaperone coexpression on steroid binding activity in Sf9 cytosol. p23 (A), Hop (B), or YDJ-1 (C) were coexpressed at the indicated virus m.o.i.s with the GR in Sf9 cells, and after 48 h, cells were harvested and cytosols were prepared.

Receptor·hsp90 heterocomplex assembly in cells or reticulocyte lysate is a very dynamic process in which assembly and disassembly are occurring simultaneously (21.Smith D.F. Mol. Endocrinol. 1993; 7: 1418-1429Crossref PubMed Scopus (251) Google Scholar). In the purified assembly system, it has been shown that the steroid binding cleft is opened to access by steroid at the same rate with or without the presence of p23, but p23 is necessary to produce stable GR·hsp90 heterocomplexes that can be immunopurified, washed, and then bound with steroid (20.Dittmar K.D. Demady D.R. Stancato L.F. Krishna P. Pratt W.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 21213-21220Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (234) Google Scholar). The receptor-bound hsp90 must achieve its ATP-bound conformation for the receptor to have steroid binding activity (22.Grenert J.P. Johnson B.D. Toft D.O. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 17525-17533Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (200) Google Scholar), and this is the conformation of hsp90 that is bound by p23 (23.Sullivan W. Stensgard B. Caucutt G.

In binding to the ATP-dependent conformation of receptor-bound hsp90, p23 stabilizes the heterocomplex.The data of Fig. 3 show that p23 is also stabilizing the GR·hsp90 heterocomplexes formed in vivo in Sf9 cells. In these experiments, Sf9 cells were coinfected with GR baculovirus and various amounts of p23 baculovirus. After 48 h of infection, cytosol was prepared and immunoadsorbed with antibody against the GR. Fig. 3A shows the insect hsp90 and human p23 coimmunoadsorbed with the native GR heterocomplexes, as well as duplicate GR immune pellets that have been stripped of insect hsp90. Fig. 3B shows the stripped GR immune pellets after they were incubated with reticulocyte lysate, washed, and immunoblotted for rabbit hsp90 and p23 in the reconstituted heterocomplexes. Fig. 3C shows the steroid binding activity of the immunoadsorbed native GR·hsp90 heterocomplexes (solid bars) and the GR·hsp90 heterocomplexes reconstituted in reticulocyte lysate (open bars). It can be seen that the steroid binding activity of the immunoadsorbed native GR·hsp90 heterocomplexes increases with increasing expression of p23 in the Sf9 cells until it reaches the level of binding achieved by GR·hsp90 heterocomplex reconstitution in reticulocyte lysate. The increase in steroid binding activity in native heterocomplexes (Fig. 3C) is accompanied by an increase in GR-bound hsp90 (Fig. 3A). The relationship between GR-bound hsp90 and steroid binding activity with increasing coexpression of p23 is shown in the graph of Fig. 3D.Fig. 3Coexpression of p23 increases GR·hsp90 heterocomplex stability in vivo. Sf9 cells were cotransfected with the GR baculovirus and with p23 baculovirus at the indicated m.o.i.s. After 48 h of infection, cytosols were prepared, and the GR was immunoadsorbed from 50-μl aliquots. A, GR, insect hsp90 and hsp70, and human p23 in native (N) heterocomplexes and after salt stripping (S) the chaperones from the immunoadsorbed GR.

D, comparison of the relative amounts of hsp90 in and steroid binding activity of native GR·hsp90 heterocomplexes immunoadsorbed from cytosol.

The GR-bound hsp90 bands were counterblotted with 125I-labeled anti-rabbit IgG, and the bands were excised and counted in a γ-counter to determine the relative amount of hsp90.

Abnormal vascular smooth muscle cell contractility plays an important role in the pathogenesis of hypertension, blood vessel spasm, and atherosclerosis. Myosin phosphatase, the key enzyme controlling myosin light chain dephosphorylation, regulates smooth muscle cell contraction. Vasoconstrictor and vasodilator pathways inhibit and activate myosin phosphatase, respectively. G-protein-coupled receptor agonists can inhibit myosin phosphatase and cause smooth muscle cell contraction by activating RhoA/Rho kinase, whereas NO/cGMP can activate myosin phosphatase and cause smooth muscle cell relaxation by activation of cGMP-dependent protein kinase. We have used yeast two-hybrid screening to identify a 116-kDa human protein that interacts with both myosin phosphatase and RhoA. This myosin phosphatase-RhoA interacting protein, or M-RIP, is highly homologous to murine p116RIP3, is expressed in vascular smooth muscle, and is localized to actin myofilaments. M-RIP binds directly to the myosin binding subunit of myosin phosphatase in vivo in vascular smooth muscle cells by an interaction between coiled-coil and leucine zipper domains in the two proteins. An adjacent domain of M-RIP directly binds RhoA in a nucleotide-independent manner. M-RIP copurifies with RhoA and Rho kinase, colocalizes on actin stress fibers with RhoA and MBS, and is associated with Rho kinase activity in vascular smooth muscle cells. M-RIP can assemble a complex containing both RhoA and MBS, suggesting that M-RIP may play a role in myosin phosphatase regulation by RhoA.

Specific blockade of Rho kinase has been found to ameliorate hypertension in several rat models (29Uehata M. Ishizaki T. Satoh H. Ono T. Kawahara T. Morishita T. Tamakawa H. Yamagami K. Inui J.

Furthermore, phosphorylation-specific antibodies against inhibitory sites on MBS demonstrate that phosphorylation correlates directly with contractile agonist-mediated myosin phosphatase inhibition (34Feng J.

Recently, a Rho kinase inhibitor has been found to be effective in preventing coronary artery spasm and treating myocardial ischemia in humans (36Masumoto A. Mohri M. Shimokawa H. Urakami L. Usui M.

Despite strong evidence for RhoA/Rho kinase-mediated inhibition of myosin phosphatase, the molecular mechanism for this contractile pathway is not well understood. Activated RhoA and Rho kinase translocate to the cell membrane (38Leung T. Manser E. Tan L. Lim L. J. Biol.

The mechanism whereby RhoA and Rho kinase are targeted to and inhibit myosin phosphatase and thereby prevent dephosphorylation of myosin light chains in contractile myofilaments remains unclear. We hypothesized that other signaling proteins regulate RhoA/Rho kinase-mediated inhibition of myosin phosphatase and searched for proteins that interact with both myosin phosphatase and RhoA using yeast two-hybrid screening methods. Here we report the identification and initial characterization of a protein that binds both MBS and RhoA. This myosin phosphatase-RhoA interacting protein (M-RIP) is a potential molecular link between RhoA signaling and myosin phosphatase regulation. Materials—Vectors pGBT9 and pGAD424, yeast strain Y190, and human aorta Matchmaker cDNA library were from Clontech. Vector pCMV tag was from Stratagene. All enzymes were from New England Biolabs. Y27632 was from Tocris. pGEX vectors were from Pharmacia, pQE vectors from Qiagen, and pCI mammalian expression vector was from Promega. The TA cloning system was from Invitrogen. Antibodies were obtained as follows: anti-MYPT1 from Covance, anti-RhoA, anti-GST, and anti-PP1 from Santa Cruz Biotechnology, M2 antibody from Sigma, anti-cGMP-dependent protein kinase from Stressgen, and anti-ROKα from Transduction Labs. Cell Culture—All cells were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium with 10% fetal bovine serum. COS-7 cells were from the American Type Culture Collection. Human aortic and coronary smooth muscle cells were cultured by the explant method. Ao184 and Co399 cells were immortalized using adenovirus expressing E6 and E7 and selection for G418 resistance. Transfections were performed by electroporation. Yeast Two-hybrid Screening—Human MBS-Cterm, base pairs 2043–3090 (kind gift of Dr. Masaaki Ito), was cloned into the EcoRI site of yeast two-hybrid vectors pGBT9 and pGAD424, expressing MBS fusion proteins with Gal4 DNA binding and DNA activating domains, respectively. Expression of MBS-Cterm in yeast was confirmed by dimerization when MBS-Cterm-pGBT9 and MBS-Cterm-pGAD424 were coexpressed in yeast (data not shown). Yeast strain Y190 was sequentially transformed with MBS-Cterm-pGBT9 and a human aorta cDNA library (Clontech) using the lithium acetate method. Interactions were identified by growth on selective media, and confirmed by colony lift filter β-galactosidase assay. The cDNA library plasmid was extracted from confirmed positive yeast colonies, and sequenced at the Tufts Core Sequencing Facility. Cloning of Full-length M-RIP—Primers were designed to amplify the 5′ sequence of M-RIP. The 5′ primer was based on a human EST that is homologous to the 5′ sequence of mouse and rat p116RIP3, gb AI 678749 (5′-ACCATGTCGGCAGCCAAGGAGAACCCGTGC-3′). The 3′ primer was based on a sequence within yeast two-hybrid clone 6 (5′-CCGCTCCTGAGCCAGGGCCTGCTGGATGGG-3′). The 5′ M-RIP sequence was amplified from the human aorta cDNA library. The PCR product was ligated into pCRII using the TA cloning system and sequenced. Full-length M-RIP was generated by overlap extension PCR using 5′ M-RIP (bp 1–1686) and yeast two-hybrid clone 6 (bp 1599–3076) alone for the first 5 cycles, then adding M-RIP 5′ and 3′ primers (5′-ACCATGTCGGCAGCCAAGGAGAACCCGTGC-3′ and 5′-ATTTCAGGTATCCCACGAGACCTGCTCAAT-3′) for 25 cycles. The PCR product was ligated into pCRII using the TA cloning system. Full-length M-RIP was sequenced in both directions (GenBank™ accession number AY296247). DNA Constructs—Full-length M-RIP with an amino-terminal FLAG tag was constructed as follows. Amino-terminal M-RIP was amplified from full-length M-RIP using primers that incorporated a 5′ FLAG sequence (5′-GATGAATTCCGACCATGGACTACAAGGACGACGATGACAAGTCGGCAGCCAAGGAGAACCCGTGCAGG-3′ and 5′-CCGCTCCTGAGCCAGGGCCTGCTGGATGGG-3′) and the PCR product that included the amino-terminal half of M-RIP was cloned into mammalian expression vector pCI. All but the FLAG-tagged amino terminus of M-RIP was replaced by adding the AgeI/NotI fragment from wild-type M-RIP to generate full-length FLAG-tagged M-RIP. M-RIP coiled-coil domains were amplified from full-length M-RIP using the following primers: CC1, 5′-TGCGGTCGACCTCGCACGTGGCCTGCAGCACGTAGCC-3′ and 5′-TGCGGTCGACCTCCCGGCCCAGGGCCACCCTCAGCTG-3′; CC2, 5′-CCGGAATTCCGAGGGTTTGCAGCAATGGAAGAAACG-3′ and 5′-TGCGGTCGACAGTCAGCAGCGTCCGCAACCGTGTGAT-3′; CC3, 5′-CCGGAATTCGCCTATGAACTAGAGGTCTTATTGCGG-3′ and 5′-TGCGGTCGACGGGGACTTCTCCCCCAGTGCTTCCGTT-3′. PCR products were cloned into pGEX and pQE vectors for expression as GST and polyhistidine fusion proteins, respectively. M-RIP-(545–823) and M-RIP-(545–878) were amplified from full-length M-RIP by PCR using the following primers: M-RIP-(545–823), 5′-CGCGGATCCGCTGAGTTCCGTCCCATCCAGCAG and 3′-GGCGAATTCCCGAGAGGACCACCAGTTCCCGC. M-RIP-(545–878) was amplified using the 5′ M-RIP-(545–823) primer and the 3′ CC2 primer. Both PCR products were cloned into pGEX and pCMV-Tag2B (Clontech) vectors for expression of GST fusion proteins in bacteria and FLAG-tagged proteins in mammalian cells, respectively. Wild-type FLAG-RhoA cDNA and GST-RhotekinRBD were kind gifts of Dr. Naoki Mochizuki. RhoA was cloned into pQE for expression of polyhistidine-tagged RhoA in bacteria. RhotekinRBD includes amino acids 1–99 of mouse Rhotekin (42Reid T. Furuyashiki T. Ishizaki T. Watanabe G. Watanabe N. Fujisawa K. Morii N. Madaule P. Narumiya S. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 13556-13560Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (314) Google Scholar), amplified by PCR from a mouse cDNA library, and ligated into pGEX4T-3. GST-MBSLZ (amino acids 847–1030) was made as described (11Surks H.K. Mochizuki N. Kasai Y. Georgescu S.P. Tang K.M. Ito M. Lincoln T.M. Mendelsohn M.E. Science. 1999; 286: 1583-1587Crossref PubMed Scopus (440) Google Scholar). GST-MBSLZ mutant was made as described (43Surks H.K. Mendelsohn M.E. Cell. Signal. 2003; 15: 937-944Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). GFP-MBS was prepared by amplifying full-length human MBS from the Clontech human aorta library, followed by ligation into pEGFP. GFP-MBSLZ mutant was prepared by replacing the COOH-terminal domain of GFP-MBS with the COOH-terminal domain of the GST-MBSLZ mutant. All DNA constructs were fully sequenced in both directions. Production of Anti-M-RIP Antisera—cDNA encoding the 5′ 480 bp of M-RIP was amplified from full-length M-RIP using PCR primers 5′-ATCGAATTCATGTCGGCAGCCAAGGAGAAC-3′ and 5′-CGATCCTCGAGCTTCTTCTGATTCTGCTTGTT-3′. The PCR product was ligated into pGEX and sequenced. The GST fusion protein of the NH2-terminal M-RIP (RIP-(1–160)) was expressed in and purified from bacteria as described (11Surks H.K. Mochizuki N. Kasai Y. Georgescu S.P. Tang K.M. Ito M. Lincoln T.M. Mendelsohn M.E. Science. 1999; 286: 1583-1587Crossref PubMed Scopus (440) Google Scholar). GST-RIP-(1–160) was eluted from glutathione-agarose beads and specific rabbit antiserum was produced at Alpha Diagnostic International, San Antonio TX. Crude antisera were purified on protein A beads as described (44Harlow E. Lane D. Antibodies, A Laboratory Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1988Google Scholar). Preparation of Fusion Proteins—GST and His6 fusion proteins were grown in bacteria overnight at 37 °C in LB with 150 μg/ml ampicillin. The culture was diluted 10-fold with LB/Amp, and incubated an additional 1 h. Isopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside was added to a final concentration of 0.1 mm for GST fusion proteins and 1 mm for His6 fusion proteins, and the cells were incubated 4 h, pelleted, and frozen. For GST fusion proteins, the cell pellet was thawed and resuspended in 35 ml of 20 mm Tris, pH 8, 100 mm NaCl, 1.5 mm EDTA, 0.1% Sarkosyl, 0.25 mg/ml lysozyme, 2 mm PMSF, 10 mm benzamidine, 20 mm dithiothreitol, and 0.01 μg/ml each of aprotinin, leupeptin, and pepstatin A. The cell lysate was incubated on ice for 15 min, then EDTA and Sarkosyl were added to final concentrations of 5 mm and 1.4%, respectively. The lysate was sonicated, centrifuged, and to the supernatant was added 20 ml of 10% Triton X-100 and glutathione-agarose beads. This was incubated for 2 h at 4 °C, following which the beads were washed with cold PBS. GST fusion proteins were either stored at 4 °C bound to glutathione-agarose beads, or eluted from beads in 50 mm Tris, pH 8.0, and 15 mm reduced glutathione, snap frozen, and stored at –80 °C. For His6 fusion proteins, the bacterial pellet was resuspended in lysis buffer consisting of 50 mm NaH2PO4, pH 8.0, 300 mm NaCl, 10 mm imidazole, 0.01 μg/ml each of aprotinin, leupeptin, and pepstatin A, 2 mm PMSF. Lysozyme was added to a final concentration of 1 mg/ml and incubated for 30 min on ice. The lysate was then sonicated and centrifuged at 12,500 rpm for 20 min. The supernatant was incubated with 0.5 ml of Ni-NTA beads (Qiagen) for 2 h, then washed with lysis buffer. His6 fusion proteins were then stored at 4 °C bound to Ni-NTA beads, or eluted from the beads in 50 mm Tris, pH 8.0, 150 mm NaCl, 5 mm MgCl2, 1 mm dithiothreitol, and 250 mm imidazole, snap frozen, and stored at –80 °C. Purification and Loading of His6RhoA—The procedure was based on that of Diekmann and Hall (45Diekmann D. Hall A. Methods Enzymol. 1995; 256: 207-215Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). Briefly, His6RhoA was purified as described above for His6 fusion proteins. Eluted His6RhoA was dialyzed in 10 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, 2 mm MgCl2, and 0.1 mm dithiothreitol, then snap frozen. Two μg of purified His6RhoA was loaded in 50 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 5 mm EDTA, and 0.5 mg/ml bovine serum albumin with either 200 μm GTPγS or GDPβS for 15 min at room temperature, followed by the addition of MgCl2 to a final concentration of 60 mm. Solubility Assay—Subconfluent cultured human aortic smooth muscle cells were rinsed twice with cold PBS and lysed in 50 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 1 mm EDTA, 0.5% Nonidet P-40, 2 mm PMSF, 0.01 μg/ml each of aprotinin, leupeptin, and pepstatin A, and 250 or 350 mm NaCl. Lysates were incubated 1 h at room temperature, then centrifuged at 14,000 rpm for 20 min. The supernatant fraction was precleared with protein A beads, then used for immunoprecipitation with polyclonal anti-M-RIP antibody as described below. An equivalent percentage of each fraction was analyzed by anti-M-RIP immunoblot. Co-immunoprecipitation Assays—Confluent cultured human aortic smooth muscle cells were rinsed in PBS, then lysed in buffer A (50 mm Tris, pH 7.6, 7 mm MgCl2, 2 mm EDTA, 2 mg/ml n-dodecyl-B-maltoside, 0.4 mg/ml cholesteryl hemisuccinate, 0.6 m NaCl, 10 mm sodium molybdate, 2 mm PMSF, and 0.01 μg/ml each of aprotinin, leupeptin, and pepstatin A) for MBS immunoprecipitations and in buffer B (40 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 0.275 m NaCl, 4 mm EDTA, 2% Triton X-100, 20% glycerol, 50 mm β-glycerol phosphate, 2 mm PMSF, and 0.01 μg/ml each of aprotinin, leupeptin, and pepstatin A) for M-RIP and cGMP-dependent protein kinase immunoprecipitations. Cell lysates were incubated1hat room temperature, then centrifuged at 14,000 rpm for 20 min at 4 °C. The supernatant was precleared with protein A beads and incubated overnight with polyclonal anti-M-RIP, anti-MBS, or anti-cGMP-dependent protein kinase 1. Protein A beads were added, and the lysates were incubated 2 h. The beads were washed three times with buffer C (50 mm Tris, pH 7.6, 7 mm MgCl2, 2 mm EDTA), then proteins were eluted in SDS sample buffer and analyzed by SDS-PAGE and immunoblotting as above. For co-immunoprecipitation of MBS with FLAG-M-RIP domains, COS-1 cells were transfected by electroporation, and lysates were prepared with buffer A as above after 48 h. Immunoprecipitations were performed as above except that M2 antibody was used for immunoprecipitation, and protein G beads were used to collect antigen-antibody complexes. Fusion Protein Interaction Assays—For fusion protein interactions with proteins from cell lysates, confluent cells were rinsed twice with ice-cold PBS, lysed in buffer A, incubated for 1 h at room temperature, then centrifuged at 14,000 rpm for 20 min at 4 °C. The supernatant was mixed with GST fusion proteins prebound to glutathione-agarose beads. After overnight incubation at 4 °C, the beads were washed with buffer C, eluted with SDS sample buffer, and bound proteins were analyzed by immunoblotting. For fusion protein interactions with purified proteins, fusion proteins immobilized on beads were incubated in buffer A for 1 h with purified soluble protein previously eluted from beads. After incubation, the beads were washed three times with buffer C, bound proteins were eluted in SDS sample buffer and analyzed by immunoblotting with anti-GST antibodies. Stress Fiber Preparation—This procedure was adapted from Katoh et al. (40Katoh K. Kano Y. Amano M. Onishi H. Kaibuchi K. Fujiwara K. J. Cell Biol. 2001; 153: 569-583Crossref PubMed Scopus (270) Google Scholar). Human aortic smooth muscle cells were grown on two 100-mm dishes to near confluence, washed with cold PBS, then extracted with 10 ml of triethanolamine extraction buffer (2.5 mm triethanolamine, 1 μg/ml leupeptin and pepstatin A, 20 μg/ml aprotinin) for 30 min, shaking, with replacement of extraction buffer every 2–3 min. Remaining cell components were then further extracted using 10 ml of Triton buffer (0.5% Triton X-100, 1 μg/ml leupeptin and pepstatin A, 20 μg/ml aprotinin in PBS) for Triton extractions or 10 ml of glycerol buffer (50% glycerol, 1 μg/ml each of leupeptin and pepstatin A, 20 μg/ml aprotinin in PBS) for glycerol extractions for 5 min while shaking, with replacement of extraction buffer twice. Triton or glycerol was then removed by washing with 10 ml of aprotinin/PBS (20 μg/ml aprotinin, 1 μg/ml leupeptin and pepstatin A in PBS) for 10 min while shaking with one replacement of wash buffer. Remaining insoluble material was then scraped in aprotinin/PBS, and homogenized with a Z-shaped 21-gauge needle. The insoluble debris was pelleted at 1,000 × g for 5 min, and stress fibers were isolated by centrifugation of the supernatant at 100,000 × g for 1 h. The stress fiber pellet was boiled in 0.1 ml of protein sample buffer and subjected to SDS-PAGE and immunoblotting with the indicated antibodies. For immunostaining of purified stress fibers, human coronary artery smooth muscle cells were grown on coverslips and glycerol-extracted as described above. Stress fibers were then fixed and immunostained as described below. All antibody dilutions were 1:100. Kinase Assay—Subconfluent human aortic smooth muscle cells were lysed and M-RIP was immunoprecipitated as described for the solubility assay above, with 350 mm NaCl. The M-RIP and nonimmune IPs were washed with Rho kinase assay buffer (adapted from Feng et al. (46Feng J. Ito M. Kureishi Y. Ichikawa K. Amano M. Isaka N. Okawa K. Iwamatsu A. Kaibuchi K.

https://openalex.org/W2118982131,"Short chain acyl-CoA dehydrogenase (SCAD) deficiency is an inborn error of the mitochondrial fatty acid metabolism caused by rare variations as well as common susceptibility variations in the SCAD gene. Earlier studies have shown that a common variant SCAD protein (R147W) was impaired in folding, and preliminary experiments suggested that the variant protein displayed prolonged association with chaperonins and delayed formation of active enzyme. Accordingly, the molecular pathogenesis of SCAD deficiency may rely on intramitochondrial protein quality control mechanisms, including degradation and aggregation of variant SCAD proteins. In this study we investigated the processing of a set of disease-causing variant SCAD proteins (R22W, G68C, W153R, R359C, and Q341H) and two common variant proteins (R147W and G185S) that lead to reduced SCAD activity. All SCAD proteins, including the wild type, associate with mitochondrial hsp60 chaperonins; however, the variant SCAD proteins remained associated with hsp60 for prolonged periods of time. Biogenesis experiments at two temperatures revealed that some of the variant proteins (R22W, G68C, W153R, and R359C) caused severe misfolding, whereas others (R147W, G185S, and Q341H) exhibited a less severe temperaturesensitive folding defect. Based on the magnitude of in vitro defects, these SCAD proteins are characterized as folding-defective variants and mild folding variants, respectively. Pulse-chase experiments demonstrated that the variant SCAD proteins either triggered proteolytic degradation by mitochondrial proteases or, especially at elevated temperature, aggregation of non-native conformers. The latter finding may indicate that accumulation of aggregated SCAD proteins may play a role in the pathogenesis of SCAD deficiency.

Subunits of the SCAD enzyme are nuclear encoded and synthesized in the cytosol as precursor proteins that are imported into the mitochondrial matrix. Newly imported SCAD proteins are proteolytically processed, folded, and assembled into the biologically active homotetrameric form (168 kDa) containing one molecule of FAD per subunit (2Naito E.

Besides the rare pathogenic variations in the SCAD gene leading to a complete deficiency of SCAD activity, two common SCAD variations have been identified in Western European populations that encode proteins with reduced catalytic activity and/or thermostability: 625G>A (G185S) and 511C>T (R147W) (12Corydon M.J.

The majority of patients reported with apparent SCAD deficiency carry only the common variant genotypes (625A/625A, 511T/511T, and 625A/511T) or a genotype defined by common variations in one allele and rare variations in the other (12Corydon M.J.

The role of 625G>A and 511C>T in the pathogenesis of SCAD deficiency, therefore, is not clear. We have hypothesized that these variations represent susceptibility alleles that, in combination with other genetic and/or environmental factors, can trigger disease in some individuals (12Corydon M.J.

To elucidate the pathogenesis of SCAD deficiency, the molecular properties of some of the identified variant SCAD enzymes, including the R147W and G185S susceptibility variants, have been investigated in a variety of in vitro systems. The R147W and G185S variant proteins were produced at lower levels in Escherichia coli, but could be partly rescued and subsequently purified by co-expression of the bacterial GroEL/ES chaperonin-system (bacterial homologue to hsp60/hsp10) (18Corydon M.J.

Purified G185S SCAD showed impaired catalytic efficiency with butyryl-CoA as substrate (10 μm-1 s-1versus 33 μm-1 s-1), whereas the catalytic efficiency (30 μm-1 s-1) and thermostability of the R147W variant enzyme were similar to that of wild type SCAD (33 μm-1 s-1) (19Nguyen T.V.

The amount of soluble variant protein at high temperature, however, was not decreased proportionally to the enzyme activity, but paralleled wild type levels.

The R22W SCAD variant has further shown to be imported normally into mitochondria, but partially folded or misfolded forms of the variant protein were eliminated from the soluble fraction at a much faster rate compared with the wild type enzyme, which was interpreted to be caused by degradation (20Corydon T.J. Bross P. Jensen T.G. Corydon M.J. Lund T.B. Jensen U.B. Kim J.J. Gregersen N. Bolund L. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 13065-13071Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). Partially folded subunits of medium chain acyl-CoA dehydrogenase (MCAD) have been shown to transiently interact with the mitochondrial chaperones hsp70 and hsp60 following import and then subsequently fold into the native conformation. Experiments with wild type MCAD and the K304E variant enzyme (the most common variation found in MCAD-deficient patients) have shown that the variant polypeptide was retained for longer time periods in high-molecular weight complexes with hsp60 following mitochondrial import compared with wild type (22Saijo T.

Similar to the results obtained with variant SCAD proteins, the yield of overexpressed K304E MCAD in E. coli was increased when it was co-expressed with GroEL/ES chaperonins (24Bross P. Jespersen C.

The aim of the present study was to compare the processing mechanism, including folding, degradation, and aggregation, of a series of rare variant SCAD enzymes, which exhibit a low level of SCAD activity when expressed in COS-7 cells, with that of the common R147W and G185S variant enzymes to relate the severity of the SCAD variations to patients with clinical SCAD deficiency. Plasmid Construction—The coding region from position -17 to +1270 of human wild type SCAD cDNA was cloned into the pcDNA3.1(+) expression vector (Invitrogen). The 274G>T (G68C), 511C>T (R147W), 529C>T (W153R), 625G>A (G185S), and 1095G>T (Q341H) variations were each introduced into the pcDNA3.1-SCAD wild type plasmid using PCR-based in vitro mutagenesis. Positions of the variant residues in the monomeric protein structure of SCAD are shown in Fig. 1. 136C>T (R22W) and 1147C>T (R359C) were introduced into the pcDNA3.1-SCAD G185S vector, because these mutations were found in the same allele as the common 625G>A (G185S) variation in SCAD patients (i.e. SCAD genotypes 136C>T/625G>A and 1147C>T/625G>A). The sequences of all mutagenic inserts were confirmed by DNA sequencing. The pCAGGS-OTC wild type and pCAGGSOTCΔ expression constructs were gifts from Dr. Nicholas J. Hoogenraad (25Zhao Q. Wang J. Levichkin I.V. Stasinopoulos S. Ryan M.T. Hoogenraad N.J. EMBO J. 2002; 21: 4411-4419Crossref PubMed Scopus (708) Google Scholar). Wild type and mutant OTC inserts were excised from pCAGGS vectors by restriction digest with EcoRI and subcloned into the EcoRI site of the pcDNA3.1(+) expression vector. Correct orientation and sequence of the OTC wild type and OTC-Δ inserts was confirmed by DNA sequencing. In Vitro Transcription/Translation of Precursor SCAD cDNA—In vitro transcription and translation of wild type and variant precursor SCAD cDNAs in pcDNA3.1(+) were performed in the presence of [35S]methionine (20 μCi/50 μl reaction, 10 μCi/μl; Amersham Biosciences) using the TnT quick-coupled transcription/translation rabbit reticulocyte lysate kit according to the manufacturer's protocol (Promega). SCAD cDNA were transcribed from pcDNA3.1(+) expression plasmids using a T7 DNA polymerase. The transcription/translation reactions were incubated for 60 min at 30 °C, and protein synthesis was stopped by addition of cycloheximide to a final concentration of 150 μg/ml. Import of in Vitro Synthesized Precursor SCAD Proteins into Isolated Mitochondria—Mitochondria were isolated from SCAD-deficient (BALB/cByJ, -/-, Ref. 26Wood P.A. Amendt B.A. Rhead W.J.

One volume of freshly prepared mitochondria was mixed with two volumes of the transcription/translation reaction and incubated at appropriate temperatures (26, 37, or 41 °C). The intramitochondrial level of ATP was maintained by adding malate (1 mmol/liter) and pyruvate (10 mmol/liter). Aliquots (20 μl) were withdrawn at the time points indicated, and trypsin was added to a final concentration of 0.5 μg/μl, and the mitochondria were incubated 10 min on ice. Soyabean trypsin inhibitor (final concentration 3 μg/μl) was added, and after 10 min incubation on ice the mitochondria were collected by centrifugation (5 min at 14,800 × g, 4 °C) and washed with 100 μl mannitol buffer. Mitochondrial pellets were stored at -80 °C for 1–2 days, before being disrupted in cold 50 mmol/liter Tris-HCL, pH 7.8, 5 mmol/liter EDTA, 1 mmol/liter dithiothreitol, 10 μg/ml aprotinin, 1 mg/ml soyabean trypsin inhibitor, and 250 mmol/liter sucrose. The mitochondrial suspensions were sonicated for 20 s in a sonication water bath (Ultrasonic Cleaner, Branson) at 4 °C, and the intramitochondrial SCAD proteins were separated in two fractions by 20 min of centrifugation at 23,000 × g (4 °C). The supernatant fraction contains soluble matrix components, including SCAD enzyme protein and complexes thereof, whereas the pellet fraction contains insoluble SCAD protein. The supernatant was carefully removed and the SCAD proteins were analyzed by native (non-denaturing) PAGE (4–15% Tris-HCl Criterion gels from Bio-Rad) and by SDS-PAGE (12.5% Tris-HCl Criterion gels from Bio-Rad). The pellet fraction was analyzed by SDS-PAGE (12.5% Tris-HCl Criterion gels from Bio-Rad). Samples for SDS-PAGE analysis were denatured by boiling for 5 min in SDS sample buffer (350 mmol/liter Tris-HCl, pH 6.8, 30% glycerol, 10% SDS, 9.3% dithiothreitol, 0.12 mg/ml bromphenol blue). Radiolabeled SCAD proteins were visualized on an Amersham Biosciences PhosphorImager (STORM 840) and quantified using the ImageQuant® software. Effects of Apyrase and Oligomycin on Tetramer Assembly and hsp60 Complexes—One volume of freshly prepared BALB/cByJ (SCAD-/-) mouse liver mitochondria was mixed with two volumes of in vitro synthesized SCAD wild type translation product at 26 °C. After 5 min import the mixture was treated with or without oligomycin and apyrase to final concentrations of 20 μm and 20 units/ml, respectively, and the mixture was incubated at 26 °C for 30 min. Mitochondrial lysates were analyzed by native PAGE as described above. Western Blotting—One volume of freshly purified BALB/cByJ (SCAD-/-) or BALB/cA (SCAD+/+) mouse liver mitochondria was incubated with two volumes of in vitro synthesized SCAD wild type protein for 15 min at 26 °C. Mitochondrial lysates were subjected to electrophoresis on native 4–15% Tris-HCl Criterion polyacrylamide gels (Bio-Rad). Blotting was performed as described previously (29Jorgensen M.M. Jensen O.N.

The blots were incubated with polyclonal anti-SCAD (1Ikeda Y. Okamura-Ikeda K. Tanaka K. J. Biol. Chem. 1985; 260: 1311-1325Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) or monoclonal antihsp60 antibodies (H-3524; Sigma), and bound antibodies were visualized by chemiluminescence using the ECL Plus™ Western blotting detection reagent (Amersham Biosciences). An Amersham Biosciences PhosphorImager (STORM 840) was used for direct image analysis. Detergent Treatment of Insoluble Proteins—One volume of freshly isolated BALB/cByJ (SCAD-/-) mitochondria was incubated with two volumes of in vitro synthesized SCAD or OTC protein for 30 min at 26 °C. The reaction mixtures were then incubated at 41 °C for a further 160 min. The mitochondria were treated and sonicated twice as described above, and the mitochondrial pellet was then sonicated in buffer with or without 1% Triton X-100. The soluble and insoluble lysate fractions were analyzed by SDS-PAGE as described above. SCAD-deficient Mitochondria as in Vitro Model System—To investigate the folding of in vitro synthesized SCAD proteins we have utilized a model system in which SCAD proteins of interest are synthesized in vitro in the presence of [35S]methionine and imported into isolated mitochondria from SCAD-deficient BALB/cByJ (SCAD-/-) mouse liver. Wild type precursor protein incubated with SCAD-/mitochondria at 26 °C for 15 min were analyzed by native (non-denaturing) PAGE followed by Western blotting (Fig. 2). The phosphorimaging analysis of imported radiolabeled SCAD (Fig. 2, lanes 1 and 2) shows two bands with apparent molecular masses of ∼450 and 170 kDa, respectively. The 170-kDa band most likely represents the mature, tetrameric form of SCAD (predicted molecular mass, 168 kDa). To confirm this, Western blotting was performed with an antibody specifically recognizing SCAD. Endogenous SCAD protein in mitochondria isolated from a normal BALB/cA (SCAD+/+) mouse strain (lane 3) co-migrated with the 170-kDa band from the import assay (lane 2), confirming that the latter band represented SCAD tetramer. SCAD protein imported in vitro into SCAD-/mitochondria was present at only a small fraction of the level of endogenous SCAD in normal (SCAD+/+) mice (Fig. 2, lanes 3 and 4). SCAD was absent in purified mitochondria from the BALB/cByJ (SCAD-/-) mouse strain (lane 5 in Fig. 2). To investigate the nature of the SCAD protein migrating at 450 kDa, Western blotting was performed with specific antibodies against the mitochondrial hsp60 chaperonin. Fig. 2 shows co-migration of hsp60 (lane 6) with the 450-kDa SCAD band (lane 2), suggesting that this band constitutes SCAD protein associated with the mature form of hsp60. The smear observed in the middle of lane 6 may represent monomers or other oligomeric forms of hsp60. Identification of the “450 kDa Form” of SCAD as a Complex between SCAD and hsp60 —Mitochondrial hsp60 chaperonins are involved in folding and assembly of newly imported proteins within the mitochondria (30Hartl F.U. Nature. 1996; 381: 571-579Crossref PubMed Scopus (3121) Google Scholar, 31Martin J. J. Bioenerg. Biomembr. 1997; 29: 35-43Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar, 32Ryan M.T. Naylor D.J. Hoj P.B.

Horwich A.L. Neupert W. Hartl F.U. Nature. 1989; 341: 125-130Crossref PubMed Scopus (478) Google Scholar). To support the identity of the 450-kDa SCAD band as a complex between newly imported SCAD protein and hsp60 chaperonins, isolated BALB/cByJ (SCAD-/-) mitochondria were incubated with in vitro synthesized radiolabeled hsp60 protein for 15 min at 26 °C, and the soluble matrix fraction was analyzed by native PAGE (Fig. 3). Fig. 3A shows that in vitro imported hsp60 protein comigrated with the 450-kDa SCAD band. Because the release of proteins from hsp60 is known to be ATP-dependent (30Hartl F.U. Nature. 1996; 381: 571-579Crossref PubMed Scopus (3121) Google Scholar, 34Ostermann J. Horwich A.L. Neupert W. Hartl F.U. Nature. 1989; 341: 125-130Crossref PubMed Scopus (478) Google Scholar), we examined the effect of ATP depletion on hsp60/SCAD-complex stability in BALB/cByJ (SCAD-/-) mitochondria. After 5 min import at 26 °C mitochondria were incubated with or without oligomycin and apyrase for another 30 min. Oligomycin specifically inhibits the mitochondrial ATP-synthetase thereby preventing the intramitochondrial synthesis of ATP, whereas apyrase catalyzes the breakdown of ATP outside the mitochondria. The import mixtures were then analyzed by native PAGE (Fig. 3B). When oligomycin and apyrase were added to the import reaction, 70 and 30% of SCAD were found associated in 450 kDa complex and tetramer, respectively. In contrast, without oligomycin and apyrase only 10% of the SCAD protein was retained in the 450-kDa complex, whereas the remaining 90% was found in the tetrameric form. These findings are compatible with the interpretation that the 450-kDa band represents a complex of SCAD and hsp60, and that release of SCAD protein from this complex requires ATP. Biogenesis of Wild Type and Variant SCAD Proteins in SCAD-deficient Mitochondria—We next compared the biogenesis of wild type SCAD with a set of variant SCAD enzymes (R22W, G68C, R147W, W153R, G185S, Q341H, and R359C; for positions in SCAD protein structure see Fig. 1). In vitro translated precursor proteins were incubated with isolated BALB/cByJ mitochondria for up to 60 min at 26 or 37 °C, and aliquots were removed at the time points indicated. Mitochondrial lysates were analyzed by native PAGE to examine the tetramers and folding intermediates of SCAD, and by SDS-PAGE to evaluate the total amounts of soluble and insoluble SCAD protein (Fig. 4; SDS-PAGE gels not shown). We have used the SCAD-deficient (SCAD-/-) mouse liver mitochondria for import experiments to eliminate the problems of interactions of variant SCAD proteins with mitochondrial endogenous wild type protein. Interactions of in vitro imported variant SCAD proteins with endogenous wild type SCAD were observed following import into isolated mitochondria from the normal BALB/cA (SCAD+/+) mouse strain, resulting in the formation of heterotetrameric proteins (Fig. 5).Fig. 5Formation of heterotetrameric SCAD enzymes in mitochondria containing endogenous SCAD protein.In vitro translation product containing SCAD R147W precursor proteins was incubated with SCAD normal BALB/cA (+/+) (lane 1) or SCAD-deficient BALB/cByJ (-/-) (lan"
https://openalex.org/W2091322376,"ACK1 (activated Cdc42-associated kinase 1) is a nonreceptor tyrosine kinase and the only tyrosine kinase known to interact with Cdc42. To characterize the enzymatic properties of ACK, we have expressed and purified active ACK using the baculovirus/Sf9 cell system. This ACK1 construct contains (from N to C terminus) the kinase catalytic domain, SH3 domain, and Cdc42-binding Cdc42/Rac interactive binding (CRIB) domain. We characterized the substrate specificity of ACK1 using synthetic peptides, and we show that the specificity of the ACK1 catalytic domain most closely resembles that of Abl. Purified ACK1 undergoes autophosphorylation, and autophosphorylation enhances kinase activity. We identified Tyr284 in the activation loop of ACK1 as the primary autophosphorylation site using mass spectrometry. When expressed in COS-7 cells, the Y284F mutant ACK1 showed dramatically reduced levels of tyrosine phosphorylation. Although the SH3 and CRIB domains of purified ACK1 are able to bind ligands (a polyproline peptide and Cdc42, respectively), the addition of ligands did not stimulate tyrosine kinase activity. To characterize potential interacting partners for ACK1, we screened several SH2 and SH3 domains for their ability to bind to full-length ACK1 or to the catalytic-SH3-CRIB construct. ACK1 interacts most strongly with the SH3 domains of Src family kinases (Src or Hck) via its C-terminal proline-rich domain. Co-expression of Hck with kinase-inactive ACK1(K158R) in mammalian cells resulted in tyrosine phosphorylation of ACK1, suggesting that ACK1 is a substrate for Hck. Our data suggest that Hck is a novel binding partner for ACK1 that can regulate ACK1 activity by phosphorylation."
https://openalex.org/W1994728700,"The N-methyl-d-aspartate (NMDA) subtype of ionotropic glutamate receptor is an important mediator of the behavioral effects of ethanol in the central nervous system. Although ethanol is known to inhibit NMDA receptors by influencing ion-channel gating, its molecular site of action and the mechanism underlying this effect have not been established. We have previously identified a conserved methionine residue in the fourth membrane-associated domain of the NMDA receptor NR2A subunit (Met823) that influences desensitization and gating of the ion channel. Here we report that this residue plays an important role in mediating the effect of ethanol on the NMDA receptor. Ethanol IC50 values among functional substitution mutants at this position varied over the range ∼130–225 mm. There was a weak correlation between ethanol IC50 and mean open time of NR2A(Met823) mutants that was dependent on inclusion of the value for the tryptophan mutant. In the absence of this value, there was no trend toward a correlation among the remaining mutants. Desensitization appeared to influence the action of ethanol, because ethanol IC50 of the mutants was correlated with the steadystate to peak current ratio. With the exception of tryptophan, ethanol sensitivity was significantly related to the molecular volume and hydrophobicity of the substituent. The relation between ethanol sensitivity and the molecular volume and hydrophobicity at this position suggests that this residue interacts with or forms part of a site of ethanol action and that the presence of a tryptophan residue in this site disrupts its ability to interact with ethanol. The N-methyl-d-aspartate (NMDA) subtype of ionotropic glutamate receptor is an important mediator of the behavioral effects of ethanol in the central nervous system. Although ethanol is known to inhibit NMDA receptors by influencing ion-channel gating, its molecular site of action and the mechanism underlying this effect have not been established. We have previously identified a conserved methionine residue in the fourth membrane-associated domain of the NMDA receptor NR2A subunit (Met823) that influences desensitization and gating of the ion channel. Here we report that this residue plays an important role in mediating the effect of ethanol on the NMDA receptor. Ethanol IC50 values among functional substitution mutants at this position varied over the range ∼130–225 mm. There was a weak correlation between ethanol IC50 and mean open time of NR2A(Met823) mutants that was dependent on inclusion of the value for the tryptophan mutant. In the absence of this value, there was no trend toward a correlation among the remaining mutants. Desensitization appeared to influence the action of ethanol, because ethanol IC50 of the mutants was correlated with the steadystate to peak current ratio. With the exception of tryptophan, ethanol sensitivity was significantly related to the molecular volume and hydrophobicity of the substituent. The relation between ethanol sensitivity and the molecular volume and hydrophobicity at this position suggests that this residue interacts with or forms part of a site of ethanol action and that the presence of a tryptophan residue in this site disrupts its ability to interact with ethanol. Ethyl alcohol or ethanol, one of the oldest and most widely abused drugs, produces a well known spectrum of behavioral effects primarily through actions on ion channels in the nervous system.

Presumed alcohol binding sites have been identified on a small number of receptors and ion channels, but the location and nature of these sites vary considerably. Sites of alcohol interaction have been reported to be located in the ion-channel lumen of nicotinic acetylcholine receptors from muscle (15.Forman S.A. Miller K.W. Yellen G. Mol. Pharmacol. 1995; 48: 574-581PubMed Google Scholar) in a cytoplasmic loop of a Drosophila potassium channel (16.Covarrubias M. Vyas T.B. Escobar L. Wei A. J. Biol.

The identity of alcohol binding sites is also variable among alcohol-sensitive proteins. No consensus sequence or structure has yet been defined for an alcohol binding site. A recent study has demonstrated that a phenylalanine residue in the third membrane-associated domain (M3) of the NR1 subunit influences ethanol sensitivity (21.Ronald K.M. Mirshahi T. Woodward J.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 44729-44735Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar), but the magnitude of the variation in ethanol sensitivity among mutants at this site suggests that it is not the sole site of alcohol action. Previous work in our laboratory has shown that the site of alcohol action on the NMDA receptor is located on a region of the protein that is accessible only from the extracellular environment (22.Peoples R.W. Stewart R.R. Neuropharmacology. 2000; 39: 1681-1691Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). We hypothesized that there may be an additional site or sites of alcohol action in one of the membrane-associated domains that participates in the regulation of ion-channel gating and that is accessible from the extracellular environment. We have previously identified a methionine residue in M4 of the NR2A subunit (Met823), which has a predicted location close to the extracellular face of the membrane and which exerts a powerful influence on NMDA receptor ion-channel gating (23.Ren H. Honse Y. Karp B.J. Lipsky R.H. Peoples R.W. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 276-283Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). We report here that this residue influences NMDA receptor alcohol sensitivity in a manner that is related both to desensitization of the ion channel and to the molecular volume and hydrophobicity of the substituent amino acid. Mutagenesis—Plasmids containing NR1-1a and NR2A subunit cDNA were kindly provided by Drs. D. R. Lynch (University of Pennsylvania) and D. M. Lovinger (National Institute on Alcohol Abuse and Alcoholism). Site-directed mutagenesis was performed using the QuikChange kit (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA), and all of the mutations were verified by DNA sequencing. Cell Culture and Transfection—Human embryonic kidney (HEK 293) cells obtained from the American Type Culture Collection (Manassas, VA) were cultured in minimum essential medium containing 2 mm l-glutamine, Earle's balanced salt solution, 0.1 mm non-essential amino acids, 1.0 mm sodium pyruvate, and 10% heat-inactivated horse serum at 37 °C in 5% CO2 and 95% air. Cells were plated at a density of 106 cells/ml in 35-mm dishes and allowed to grow to 70–95% confluence prior to transient transfection using LipofectAMINE 2000 or calcium phosphate (both from Invitrogen). The cDNA plasmid ratio for NR1 and NR2A subunits and green fluorescent protein (pGreen Lantern, Invitrogen) was 2:2:1 (total amount of DNA, 2.5–6 μg). During and after the transfection, 100 μm ketamine and 200 μm dl-2-amino-5-phosphonovaleric acid were added to the culture medium to enhance survival of transfected cells. Within 18–72 h following transfection, cells were mechanically dissociated and plated at a low density in 35-mm dishes for use in experiments. Electrophysiological Recording—Whole-cell patch clamp recording was performed using an Axopatch 1D or 200B (Axon Instruments Inc., Union City, CA) amplifier at room temperature. Electrodes with open tip resistances of 1–5 megohms were used. After establishing whole-cell mode, series resistances of 2–10 megohms were compensated by 80%. Cells were voltage-clamped at –50 mV and superfused in an extracellular solution containing 150 mm NaCl, 5 mm KCl, 0.2 mm CaCl2, 10 mm HEPES, and 10 mm glucose. pH was titrated to 7.4 with NaOH, and osmolality was adjusted to 340 mmol/kg with sucrose. Low Ca2+ was used to minimize NMDA receptor inactivation (24.Zilberter Y. Uteshev V. Sokolova S. Khodorov B. Mol. Pharmacol. 1991; 40: 337-341PubMed Google Scholar). The intracellular (patch pipette) solution contained 140 mm CsCl, 2 mm Mg4ATP, 10 mm BAPTA, and 10 mm HEPES. pH was titrated to 7.4 with CsOH, and osmolality was adjusted to 310 mmol/kg with sucrose. Data were filtered at 2 kHz (low pass, 8-pole Bessel) and acquired at 5–10 kHz on a computer using a DigiData interface and pClamp8 software (Axon Instruments). Drug Application—Solutions of agonists and ethanol were applied to cells by using a stepper motor-driven rapid solution exchange apparatus (Fast-step, Warner Instrument Co., used without the metallic manifolds supplied by the manufacturer) and 600-μm-inner diameter square glass tubing. Drugs were prepared daily in extracellular solution. Ethanol (95%, prepared from grain) was obtained from Pharmco Products (Brookfield, CT), and all of the other chemicals were obtained from Sigma. Calculation of Physicochemical Properties of Amino Acids—Molecular (van der Waals) volumes of amino acids were calculated using Spartan Pro (Wavefunction, Inc., Irvine, CA) following structural optimization using the AM1 semi-empirical parameters. Values used for amino acid hydropathy, hydrophilicity, and polarity were reported previously (25.Hopp T.P. Woods K.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1981; 78: 3824-3828Crossref PubMed Scopus (2922) Google Scholar, 26.Kyte J. Doolittle R.F. J. Mol. Biol. 1982; 157: 105-132Crossref PubMed Scopus (17296) Google Scholar, 27.Zimmerman J.M. Eliezer N. Simha R. J. Theor. Biol. 1968; 21: 170-201Crossref PubMed Scopus (424) Google Scholar). Data Analysis—Values reported for IC50 (half-maximal inhibitory concentration) and n (slope factor) were obtained from nonlinear curve fitting (Origin, OriginLab Corp., Northampton, MA) of data to Equation 1,y=Emax/[1+(IC50/x)n](Eq. 1) where y is the percent inhibition and Emax is the maximal inhibition. IC50 values for inhibition of steady-state current were used because these did not differ significantly from those for peak current in mutants exhibiting substantial desensitization. Logarithmically transformed IC50 values obtained from fitting concentration-response data from individual cells were statistically compared using analysis of variance (ANOVA) followed by the Fisher's protected least significant difference (PLSD) test. In fluctuation analysis experiments, the data were filtered at 1 kHz (low pass 8-pole, Butterworth) and 25–60 traces, 600 or 800 ms in length, were acquired at 5 kHz. Background spectra were subtracted, and averaged spectra were fitted with a Lorentzian function of the form as shown in Equation 2,Sf=So(1/[1+(f/fc)2])(Eq. 2) where Sf is the spectral density at frequency f (in Hz), So is the zero-frequency asymptote, and fc is the corner frequency. Time constants (τ) were obtained from the relationship τ = 1/2πfc. ANOVA, PLSD test, correlation analysis, and linear regression analysis were performed using the program StatView (SAS Institute, Inc., Cary, NC). All of the data values are expressed as the mean ± S.E. Mutations at NR2A(Met823) Alter Ethanol Sensitivity—We have previously identified a site in the M4 region of the NR2A subunit, NR2A(Met823), that regulates NMDA receptor ion-channel gating (Fig. 1) (23.Ren H. Honse Y. Karp B.J. Lipsky R.H. Peoples R.W. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 276-283Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). To test whether this site might participate in ethanol inhibition of NMDA receptors, we examined ethanol sensitivity of substitution mutants at this site. As we have reported previously, a number of amino acid substitutions at this site yielded nonfunctional receptors (23.Ren H. Honse Y. Karp B.J. Lipsky R.H. Peoples R.W. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 276-283Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). All of the functional NR2A(Met823) substitution mutant receptors tested were inhibited by ethanol in a concentration-dependent manner (Fig. 2). The slope factors of the ethanol concentration-response curves did not differ significantly among the various mutants. However, the values for ethanol IC50 varied significantly among the mutants, ranging from 131 to 224 mm (ANOVA, p < 0.0001). Expression of the mutant subunits NR2A(M823C), NR2A(M823S), or NR2A(M823W) with NR1 subunits produced receptors with the lowest sensitivity to ethanol, and coexpression of NR1 subunits with NR2A(M823F), NR2A(M823L), or NR2A(M823Y) mutant subunits resulted in receptors with the highest sensitivity to ethanol.Fig. 2Effect of ethanol on NMDA-activated current in cells expressing NR2A(Met823) mutant subunits.A, records are currents activated by 25 μm NMDA and 10 μm glycine in the absence and presence of 100 mm ethanol in HEK 293 cells coexpressing NR1 and wild type NR2A (WT) or various NR2A(Met823) substitution mutant subunits.

Fig. 3 shows plots of power density spectra for NMDA-activated current in cells expressing NR1/NR2A(M823I) and NR1/NR2A(M823L) mutant receptors. As we have observed previously (23.Ren H. Honse Y. Karp B.J. Lipsky R.H. Peoples R.W. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 276-283Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar), time constants derived from fitting of Lorentzian functions to power density spectra revealed that the mean open time of NR1/NR2A(M823I) NMDA receptors was markedly reduced compared with that in wild type receptors. Nevertheless, ethanol produced a decrease in the mean open time in these receptors similar to that observed in wild type receptors. On average, 100 mm ethanol inhibited mean open time by 25 ± 1.9% in receptors containing NR2A(M823I) subunits (0.82 ± 0.034 versus 0.62 ± 0.024 ms in the absence and presence of ethanol, respectively, Student's paired t test, p < 0.0005). Similar results were obtained in cells expressing NR1/NR2A(M823L) mutant subunits (27 ± 1.4% inhibition of mean open time, 2.2 ± 0.19 versus 1.6 ± 0.13 ms in the absence and presence of ethanol, respectively, Student's paired t test, p < 0.01). These observations are similar to results obtained for wild type receptors in native neurons in a previous study (14.Wright J.M. Peoples R.W. Weight F.F. Brain Res. 1996; 738: 249-256Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar). In addition, a variance analysis of NMDA-activated current indicated that the unitary conductance of the ion channel was not changed in the presence of ethanol in receptors containing NR2A(M823I) or NR2A(M823L) mutant subunits (data not shown). Relation of Ethanol Sensitivity to Glycine Sensitivity—Because the inhibitory potency of ethanol on the NMDA receptor may be linked to sensitivity to the coagonist glycine under some conditions (21.Ronald K.M. Mirshahi T. Woodward J.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 44729-44735Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar, 28.Buller A.L. Larson H.C. Morrisett R.A. Monaghan D.T. Mol. Pharmacol. 1995; 48: 717-723PubMed Google Scholar), we tested whether representative mutations that altered ethanol sensitivity could alter the glycine concentration-response relationship. We found no significant differences in EC50 values of glycine for activation of peak and steady-state current in cells expressing wild type, NR2A(M823C), NR2A(M823F), NR2A(M823W), and NR2A(M823Y) subunits (Table I).Table IGlycine concentration-response parameters in NR2A(M823) mutantsGlycine EC50Hill slopeIpIssIpIssμmμmnWT3.12 ± 0.3652.68 ± 1.331.46 ± 0.06961.33 ± 0.1206M823C3.13 ± 0.3952.11 ± 0.3361.43 ± 0.1481.43 ± 0.1165M823F2.87 ± 0.3812.28 ± 0.2861.55 ± 0.06261.53 ± 0.04466M823W3.36 ± 0.4902.83 ± 0.5731.53 ± 0.1111.36 ± 0.2279M823Y3.15 ± 0.3211.75 ± 0.2201.45 ± 0.05701.60 ± 0.1167 Open table in a new tab Relation of Ethanol Sensitivity to Desensitization and Mean Open Time—For mutant subunits exhibiting marked desensitization, no differences were observed for ethanol inhibitory potency of peak versus steady-state current (data not shown). Because the mean open time and steady-state to peak current ratio varied widely among mutants (Fig. 4), we tested whether either of these parameters could be related to the observed differences in ethanol sensitivity. Ethanol IC50 was significantly correlated with steady-state to peak current ratio (Fig. 4A, R2 = 0.445; p < 0.05). There was also a significant correlation between ethanol sensitivity and mean open time (Fig. 4B, R2 = 0.465; p < 0.05) for the series of NR2A(Met823) mutants. However, this latter correlation was entirely dependent on the long mean open time observed in the tryptophan mutant because the correlation disappeared when this mutant was excluded from the analysis (R2 = 0.0298; p > 0.05), despite the fact that both mean open time and ethanol IC50 varied significantly among the remaining mutants. Ethanol Sensitivity Depends upon Hydrophilicity and Molecular Volume of the Substituent at NR2A(Met823)—If the observed changes in ethanol sensitivity among the NR2A(Met823) mutant subunits were due to a direct interaction of ethanol with this site, one would predict that this would be reflected in a significant linear relation of ethanol sensitivity with one or more physicochemical parameters of the amino acid substituent at the site. To evaluate the relative contribution of the physicochemical parameters of the amino acid residue at this site to alcohol sensitivity, we performed linear regression analysis of alcohol sensitivity versus hydropathy, hydrophilicity, hydrogen bonding, molecular volume, and polarity of the substituent (Fig. 5). When all of the substitution mutants were included in the analysis, there was no significant linear relation observed between ethanol IC50 and hydropathy (R2 = 0.106; p > 0.05), hydrophilicity (R2 = 0.00035; p > 0.05), molecular volume (R2 = 0.00808; p > 0.05), polarity (R2 = 0.197; p > 0.05), hydrogen bond acceptance (R2 = 0.0173; p > 0.05), or hydrogen bond donation (R2 = 0.132; p > 0.05). However, closer inspection of the plots of ethanol IC50versus hydrophilicity and molecular volume revealed a clear linear trend among the mutants with the exception of tryptophan. When tryptophan was excluded from the analysis, significant linear relationships were observed between ethanol IC50 and both hydrophilicity (R2 = 0.522; p < 0.05) and molecular volume (R2 = 0.683; p < 0.005) of the substituent. The results of the present study demonstrate that mutations at the conserved methionine (Met823) in the fourth membrane-associated domain of the NR2A subunit influence sensitivity of the NMDA receptor-ion channel to ethanol. The range over which ethanol IC50 values varied among the mutants is greater than the range we have previously observed among wild type NR2 subunits (results not shown). Although it is not possible at present to demonstrate conclusively that the fundamental mechanism of action of ethanol was not different among the various mutants, the observation that substitutions at this position did not alter either the slope factor of the ethanol concentration-response curve or the extent of inhibition by ethanol of mean open time is consistent with this idea. We previously reported that both the rate and extent of desensitization as well as mean open time differed significantly among the various mutants at NR2A(Met823), indicating an important role for this residue in the regulation of ion channel gating (23.Ren H. Honse Y. Karp B.J. Lipsky R.H. Peoples R.W. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 276-283Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). A recent report has also shown a role for the M4 domain in regulating desensitization (29.Schorge S. Colquhoun D. J. Neurosci. 2003; 23: 1151-1158Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Although ethanol inhibits the NMDA receptor largely by decreasing mean open time of the ion channel, there was only a weak correlation in the present study between ethanol sensitivity and mean open time of NR2A(Met823) mutants that was entirely dependent on the inclusion of the value for the tryptophan mutant. When this value was excluded from the analysis, there was no trend toward a correlation of ethanol sensitivity with mean open time among the remaining mutants, despite the fact that there were still significant differences among these mutants in both ethanol IC50 and mean open time. In contrast, ethanol sensitivity among the various NR2A(Met823) mutants in the present study was correlated with the steady-state to peak current ratio, a measure of the extent of macroscopic desensitization, such that the greater the desensitization in a given mutant, the lower its ethanol sensitivity. A possible explanation for this latter observation could be that NR2A(Met823) influences ethanol potency indirectly via changes in desensitization. However, this explanation is not supported by results of studies in wild type NMDA receptors in which ethanol potency is not reduced at high, desensitizing agonist concentrations (6.Göthert M. Fink K. Naunyn-Schmiedeberg's Arch. Pharmacol. 1989; 340: 516-521Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar, 8.Peoples R.W. White G. Lovinger D.M. Weight F.F. Br. J. Pharmacol. 1997; 122: 1035-1042Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar, 11.Gonzales R.A. Woodward J.J. J. Pharmacol. Exp. Ther. 1990; 253: 1138-1144PubMed Google Scholar). This observation could instead indicate that ethanol acts in part by increasing NMDA receptor desensitization (14.Wright J.M. Peoples R.W. Weight F.F. Brain Res. 1996; 738: 249-256Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar), but no increase in macroscopic apparent desensitization in the presence of ethanol was observed in any of the mutant receptors tested in the present study. Furthermore, from inspection of the plot of steady-state to peak ratio versus ethanol IC50, it is apparent that there is not an absolute dependence of ethanol sensitivity on desensitization. For example, the steady-state to peak ratios of the alanine and tyrosine substitution mutants were similar, but the ethanol IC50 values of these mutant subunits differed considerably. Although the results of the present study cannot exclude a role for desensitization in the action of ethanol, a more probable explanation for these observations may be that similar molecular forces at NR2A(Met823) influence both changes in desensitization and changes in alcohol sensitivity. Other investigators have presented evidence that alcohols and anesthetics are able to bind to a site formed by residues in the M2 and M3 domains of GABAA and glycine receptors and regulate channel function in a manner that is dependent upon volume occupation of the site (18.Mihic S.J.

Neurosci. 2001; 21: 1-4Crossref Google Scholar). In this study, we did not initially observe a relation between ethanol sensitivity and molecular volume of the substitution at NR2A(Met823). However, when the value for the tryptophan mutant was excluded from the analysis, there was a highly significant linear relation of ethanol sensitivity with molecular volume. Because tryptophan is the largest naturally occurring amino acid, this finding may indicate that the action of ethanol involves filling a critical volume in a cavity formed in part by this site in the receptor and that the presence of a bulky tryptophan residue in the cavity severely disrupts its ability to interact with ethanol. In addition, in this study we observed that ethanol sensitivity of the mutants, with the exception of tryptophan, was related to the hydrophilicity at this position. A number of previous studies have demonstrated that the action of alcohols on NMDA receptors largely depends upon hydrophobic interactions (1.Lovinger D.M. White G. Weight F.F.

The observation of a relation between ethanol sensitivity and hydrophilicity of the substituent at NR2A(Met823) in this study suggests that ethanol interacts with this site in a manner that involves hydrophobic binding. The observations of this study are consistent with a role of NR2A(Met823) in mediating part of the inhibitory effect of ethanol on the NMDA receptor. In particular, the observations that ethanol sensitivity was significantly related to the molecular volume and hydrophobicity of the substituent fulfill part of the criteria for a putative site of alcohol action. Previous studies on other alcohol-sensitive ion channels have reported correlations between the molecular volume of various alcohols and anesthetics and their potency for ion-channel modulation (31.Jenkins A.

Neuropharmacology. 2001; 41: 952-964Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar). In addition, in one of these studies, the anesthetic molecular volume above which ion-channel modulatory potency is lost (“cutoff” point) was dependent upon the molecular volume of the substituent at a proposed site of alcohol action (31.Jenkins A. Greenblatt E.P. Faulkner H.J. Bertaccini E. Light A. Lin A. Andreasen A. Viner A. Trudell J.R. Harrison N.L. J. Neurosci. 2001; 21: 1-4Crossref Google Scholar, 36.Godden E.L. Harris R.A.

Neuropharmacology. 2001; 41: 952-964Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar). Although similar results might be expected for this site on the NMDA receptor based on the previous observation of a cutoff (34.Peoples R.W. Weight F.F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 2825-2829Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar), we have recently shown that the cutoff phenomenon for alcohol inhibition of the NMDA receptor is not dependent upon the molecular volume of the alcohol (35.Peoples R.W. Ren H. Mol. Pharmacol. 2002; 61: 169-176Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). Thus, in light of our previous results, we consider that the results of the present paper are most consistent with a model in which NR2A(Met823) forms part of a site of alcohol action that is better represented as a long groove rather than a spherical pocket. In this scheme, alcohols bind in the long axis of the groove and NR2A(Met823) is in a critical region that is perpendicular to the long axis of the groove. The correlation with molecular volume of the amino acid at this site observed in the present paper suggests that part of the alcohol molecule interacts with NR2A(Met823) to influence channel function. According to this model, increases in the size of the amino acid side chain would extend perpendicular to the axis of the groove, whereas changes in alcohol chain length would extend parallel to it so that changes in the molecular volume of the amino acid or the alcohol would produce disparate effects. If this interpretation is correct, it would imply that changes in the molecular volume of amino acids at positions adjacent to NR2A(Met823) along the binding groove would probably alter the potency of alcohols with different carbon chain lengths. Future experiments should address this possibility. The importance of NR2A(Met823) in regulation of normal ion-channel function (23.Ren H. Honse Y. Karp B.J. Lipsky R.H. Peoples R.W. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 276-283Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar) is in contrast to the view that mutations at a site of ethanol action on a protein should not disrupt its function. In light of the fact that ethanol produces its effects at concentrations in the millimolar range, however, for any ethanol-sensitive protein, ethanol undoubtedly interacts with low affinity with multiple sites and one or more of these sites that are important in normal regulation of function could constitute the sites of ethanol action. This appears to be true of putative alcohol and anesthetic binding sites on glycine and GABAA receptors (18.Mihic S.J. Ye Q. Wick M.J. Koltchine V.V. Krasowski M.A. Finn S.E. Mascia M.P.

Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 6504-6509Crossref PubMed Scopus (192) Google Scholar), because a recent study has reported that a mutation in at least one of these sites alters ion-channel gating (38.Scheller M. Forman S.A. J. Neurosci. 2002; 22: 8411-8421Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). It should be noted that NR2A(Met823) does not appear to be able to account completely for ethanol inhibition, because ethanol sensitivity was not eliminated in any of the mutants tested. Because both NR1 and NR2 subunit activation is required for NMDA receptor-ion-channel opening, it is possible that sites of ethanol action are located on both subunit types. In this regard, an ethanol-sensitive site in the third membrane-associated domain (M3) of the NR1 subunit has been reported recently (21.Ronald K.M. Mirshahi T. Woodward J.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 44729-44735Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar). Interestingly, mutations at this site in M3 can influence glycine potency (21.Ronald K.M. Mirshahi T. Woodward J.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 44729-44735Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar) and appear to alter ion-channel gating as well. 2Y. Honse and R. W. Peoples, unpublished observations. Ethanol may thus inhibit the NMDA receptor by acting in concert at multiple sites, including NR2A(Met823), that are important in the regulation of NMDA receptor function. Future experiments should allow assessment of the magnitude of the contribution of each of these sites in the NR1 and NR2 subunits to the overall alcohol sensitivity of the NMDA receptor.

In eukaryotic organisms, protein phosphatases play a key role in the control and integration of cellular physiology.

The PP1 catalytic subunit (PP1c) is highly conserved throughout evolution. In most eukaryotes, several isoforms have been described (i.e. four in mammals), although in the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae only one PP1c is present, named Glc7, which is essential for cell viability (4Feng Z.H.

Similar to its mammalian counterpart, Glc7 participates in the regulation of many different cellular processes such as glycogen metabolism, glucose repression, ion homeostasis, mitosis, meiosis, sporulation, vacuole fusion, endocytosis, polyadenylation termination, and cell wall integrity (6Cannon J.

PP1c functional versatility can be achieved due to the existence of several regulatory subunits that act either targeting PP1c to different subcellular compartments and/or substrates, conferring substrate specificity or modulating enzymatic activity (15Bollen M. Trends Biochem. Sci. 2001; 26: 426-431Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (252) Google Scholar, 16Cohen P.T. J. Cell Sci. 2002; 115: 241-256Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). To date, more than 45 bona fide or putative PP1c-regulating subunits have been defined in higher eukaryotes (15Bollen M. Trends Biochem.

These subunits are structurally quite different, but almost all of them present a consensus binding motif (R/K)(V/I)X(F/W) necessary for PP1c regulation, which can also account for the mutually exclusive binding of the different subunits to PP1c (15Bollen M.

PP1c activity is essential but must be tightly controlled, since overexpression or hyperactivation of PP1c phosphatase is also deleterious to the cell. Consequently, a large number of physiological inhibitors of PP1c have been identified in higher eukaryotes (15Bollen M. Trends Biochem. Sci. 2001; 26: 426-431Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (252) Google Scholar, 16Cohen P.T. J. Cell Sci. 2002; 115: 241-256Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 17Aggen J.B. Nairn A.C.

Among them, inhibitor-1 and inhibitor-2 are of special interest because they represent two different ways of inhibiting PP1c phosphatase activity. Inhibitor-1 and its structural homologue DARPP-32 require phosphorylation by the cAMP-dependent protein kinase A to gain PP1c-inhibitory capacity. In contrast, inhibitor-2 inhibits PP1c only in its dephosphorylated form (16Cohen P.T. J. Cell Sci. 2002; 115: 241-256Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 21Eto M. Karginov A. Brautigan D.L.

However, no yeast homologue of inhibitor-1 has been described yet, and the yeast homologue of mammalian inhibitor-2, Glc8 (29Tung H.Y. Wang W. Chan C.S. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 6064-6074Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar), functions as an activator rather than as an inhibitor of Glc7 (30Nigavekar S.S. Tan Y.S. Cannon J.F. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 2002; 404: 71-79Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). Recently, in a two-hybrid screening of a human brain cDNA library searching for potential mammalian PP1c regulatory proteins, a novel PP1 inhibitor, namely inhibitor-3, was identified. This protein shared 21% identity with a protein of unknown function encoded by the yeast YFR003c open reading frame (31Zhang J. Zhang L. Zhao S. Lee E.Y. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 16728-16734Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). It was also demonstrated by two-hybrid analysis that the Yfr003c protein could interact with Glc7 (32Tu J. Song W. Carlson M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 4199-4206Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar, 33Uetz P. Giot L. Cagney G. Mansfield T.A. Judson R.S. Knight J.R. Lockshon D. Narayan V. Srinivasan M.

A. 2001; 98: 4569-4574Crossref PubMed Scopus (2912) Google Scholar). Therefore, this protein could be a good candidate for an endogenous inhibitor of Glc7 phosphatase activity. Ppz1 and Ppz2 are PP1-related phosphatases involved in saline tolerance, cell wall integrity, cell cycle progression, and protein translation regulation, and, very recently, they have also been related to regulation of K+ and pH homeostasis (35Arino J. Eur. J. Biochem. 2002; 269: 1072-1077Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar, 36Yenush L. Mulet J.M. Arino J. Serrano R. EMBO J. 2002; 21: 920-929Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar). Among them, Ppz1 appears to be more relevant than Ppz2 in regulating the functions mentioned above (35Arino J. Eur. J. Biochem. 2002; 269: 1072-1077Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). Recent results indicate that Ppz phosphatases and Glc7 might have overlapping functions to some extent and that Ppz1 shares a subset of Glc7 regulatory subunits to fulfill its function (37Venturi G.M. Bloecher A. Williams-Hart T. Tatchell K. Genetics. 2000; 155: 69-83PubMed Google Scholar). Interestingly, the Yfr003c protein has also been reported to interact with Ppz1 in a two-hybrid analysis (37Venturi G.M. Bloecher A. Williams-Hart T. Tatchell K. Genetics. 2000; 155: 69-83PubMed Google Scholar). In this sense, Yfr003c could also be a good candidate for an inhibitor of Ppz1 phosphatase activity in the same way as Hal3, a specific inhibitor of this type of phosphatases (38de Nadal E. Clotet J. Posas F. Serrano R. Gomez N. Arino J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 7357-7362Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar), which appears to regulate all known functions of Ppz1 (35Arino J. Eur. J. Biochem. 2002; 269: 1072-1077Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). In this report, we provide both in vitro and in vivo evidence demonstrating that the protein encoded by YFR003c is an inhibitor of the type 1 protein phosphatase Glc7 and, to some extent, perhaps of Ppz1. Hence, we propose the name Ypi1 (for yeast phosphatase inhibitor 1) for this protein. Strains and Culture Conditions—Escherichia coli DH5α was used as the recipient cell for all plasmids and constructions. Yeast strains used in this work are listed in Table I. The ypi1Δ heterozygous null mutant was constructed using a diploid strain, M5 (see Table I), by a one-step short flanking kanamycin disruption method (39Wach A. Brachat A. Pöhlmann R. Philippsen P. Yeast. 1994; 10: 1793-1808Crossref PubMed Scopus (2218) Google Scholar). The disruption cassette was generated by PCR using as template plasmid pFA6a-kanMX4 and primers YFRdel-1 and YFRdel-2 (see below). In this way, we disrupted by homologous recombination the complete YPI1 (YFR003c) open reading frame (from +1 ATG to the stop codon) in one of the two wild type alleles of the diploid. Mutants were confirmed by genomic PCR analyses using specific nucleotides for the wild type allele (oligonucleotides YFR-1 and YFR-2) and for the disrupted allele (oligonucleotides YFRPR-1, outside the disruption cassette, and YFRdel-2, inside the KanMX4 selection marker). Tetrad analysis was performed by standard methods, and the presence of the disruption cassette in the viable spore progeny was scored by its associated phenotype (growth in YPD containing 200 μg/ml Geneticin plates).Table IStrains used in this workName of strainGenotypeReferenceFY250MATα his3 leu2 trp1 ura345Sanz P.

New restrictions sites are underlined. The ATG initiating codon is denoted in boldface type. Mutated codons are in lowercase letters. Plasmids—All plasmids containing the YPI1 (YFR003c) open reading frame were constructed by inserting the PCR-derived open reading frame (from +1 ATG to the stop codon) obtained using primers YFR-1 and YFR-2 and genomic DNA from strain FY250 as template. The PCR product was sequenced to confirm that no modifications were introduced by the Taq polymerase. The PCR product was subcloned into the EcoRI and SalI sites of the plasmids used in this work: pWS93 (41Song W. Carlson M. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 5757-5765Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar), to tag Ypi1 protein with 3× HA epitopes (plasmid pWS-Ypi1); pGEX-6P-1 (Amersham Biosciences) to express a GST-Ypi1 fusion protein in E. coli (plasmid pGEX-Ypi1); and pUC18 (plasmid pUC-Ypi1). The YPI1(W53A) mutant form was obtained using the QuikChange site-directed mutagenesis kit from Stratagene (La Jolla, CA). Plasmid pUC-Ypi1 was used as template in the PCRs using oligonucleotides YFRW53A-1 and YFRW53A-2 described above. The appearance of a new restriction site, AluI, was used to select the putative mutant, which was fully sequenced to check for the correct introduction of the mutation and the absence of unwanted changes. The plasmid obtained was called pUC-Ypi1W53A. An EcoRI-SalI fragment from pUC-Ypi1W53A was subcloned into pWS93 and pGEX-6P-1 to express the mutated protein in yeast (plasmid pWS-Ypi1W53A) and E. coli (plasmid pGEX-Ypi1W53A), respectively. The construction of an N-terminally deleted (Δ1–344) form of Ppz1, containing only the catalytic domain, as a GST fusion in plasmid pGEX-KT has been described previously (42Clotet J. Posas F. de Nadal E. Arino J. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 26349-26355Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). GST-Glc7 was obtained from Dr. C. S. Chan (29Tung H.Y. Wang W. Chan C.S. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 6064-6074Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). GST-Hal3 was obtained by subcloning an EcoRI-XhoI fragment from plasmid YPGE15 (36Yenush L. Mulet J.M. Arino J. Serrano R. EMBO J. 2002; 21: 920-929Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar) into pGEX6P-1. High copy expression of HAL3 in yeast (plasmid pHAL3) was accomplished by cloning a 3.2-kbp EcoRI-HindIII genomic fragment containing the entire gene into the same sites of plasmid YEplac195 (43Gietz R.D. Sugino A. Gene (Amst.). 1988; 74: 527-534Crossref PubMed Scopus (2500) Google Scholar). Expression of Recombinant Proteins in E. coli—Purification of the fusion proteins GST-Glc7, GST-Ppz1Δ1–344, GST-Ypi1, GST-Ypi1W53A, and GST-Hal3 was carried out as described in Ref. 44Zhang A.J.

E. coli transformants harboring the different GST fusions were grown in 500 ml of LB/ampicillin, supplemented with 0.5 mm MnCl2 only for purification of GST-Glc7 and GST-Ppz1Δ1–344. Transformants were grown at 37 °C until the absorbance at 600 nm reached a value of about 0.3. Isopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside was then added to a concentration of 0.1 mm, and cultures were grown overnight at 25 °C. Cells were harvested and resuspended in 20 ml of sonication buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.6, 0.2 mm EGTA, 150 mm NaCl, 10% glycerol, 0.1% Triton X-100, 2 mm dithiothreitol, 2 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and complete protease inhibitor mixture (Roche Applied Science)). This buffer was made 2 mm MnCl2 when purifying GST-Glc7 and GST-Ppz1Δ1–344 fusion proteins. Cells were disrupted by sonication, and the fusion proteins were purified by passing the extracts through a 1-ml bed volume of glutathione-Sepharose columns (Amersham Biosciences). To remove the GST moiety from GST fusions to Ypi1 and Ypi1W53A, the fusion proteins bound to the glutathione-Sepharose beads were treated with PreScission Protease (Amersham Biosciences) during 4–5 h at 4 °C following the manufacturer's instructions. GST-Glc7, GST-Ppz1Δ1–344, GST-Hal3, and GST proteins were eluted from the column with 10 mm glutathione. Samples were stored at –80 °C. Pull-down Assays and Immunoblot Analysis—Preparation of yeast protein extracts for pull-down assays was essentially as described previously (45Sanz P. Alms G.R. Haystead T.A.J. Carlson M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 1321-1328Crossref PubMed Scopus (177) Google Scholar). Extraction buffer was 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 150 mm NaCl, 0.1% Triton X-100, 1 mm dithiothreitol, and 10% glycerol and contained 2 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride and complete protease inhibitor mixture (Roche Applied Science). The E. coli protein extracts were prepared as described above. Pull-down assays were carried out as follows. Fusion proteins (GST-Glc7 and GST-Ppz1Δ1–344) made in E. coli were allowed to bind to glutathione-Sepharose (Amersham Biosciences) affinity matrix for 1 h at 4 °C with gentle shaking. Then the beads were washed four times with extraction buffer (see above). Yeast extracts (500 μg) were then incubated with the beads for an additional 1 h at 4 °C and again washed four times with extraction buffer. Proteins retained by the affinity system were detected by SDS-PAGE followed by immunoblot using anti-GST polyclonal (Amersham Biosciences) or anti-HA monoclonal (Roche Applied Science) antibodies and chemiluminiscence reagents (ECL; Amersham Biosciences). Protein Phosphatase Assays—Protein phosphatase activity using p-nitrophenylphosphate as substrate was determined essentially as described in Ref. 46Silberman S.R. Speth M. Nemani R. Ganapathi M.K. Dombradi V. Paris H. Lee E.Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1984; 259: 2913-2922Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar. The reaction buffer was 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 0.1 mm EGTA, 2 mm MnCl2, and 1 mm dithiothreitol. Samples were incubated for 10 min at 30 °C, and then the reaction was stopped by adding 1% Tris (final concentration). For phosphatase inhibition assays, different amounts of the purified inhibitors were incubated with the purified phosphatases during 5 min at 30 °C, prior to the addition of p-nitrophenylphosphate. Alternatively, we used the N-terminal domain of the Reg1 protein tagged with HA (HA-Reg11–443) as endogenous protein substrate. This protein showed a clear change in electrophoretic mobility after shifting cells from medium containing high (4%) glucose to low (0.05%) glucose, due to phosphorylation of the protein (45Sanz P. Alms G.R. Haystead T.A.J. Carlson M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 1321-1328Crossref PubMed Scopus (177) Google Scholar). Since Reg1 is dephosphorylated by Glc7 in response to glucose, for these assays we used the mutant allele glc7-T152K (strain MCY3000), which is defective in dephosphorylating Reg1 (45Sanz P. Alms G.R. Haystead T.A.J. Carlson M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 1321-1328Crossref PubMed Scopus (177) Google Scholar). MCY3000 transformants expressing HA-Reg11–443 were grown until exponential phase (A600 around 0.4–0.7) in SC medium containing 4% glucose as carbon source, and shifted to a medium containing 0.05% glucose during 20 min. Cells were then harvested, and yeast crude extract was obtained as described above. One μg of this extract was incubated for 20 min at 30 °C with 1.8 μg of GST-Glc7 or GST-Ppz1Δ1–344 in a buffer containing 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 0.1 mm EGTA, 2 mm MnCl2 and 1 mm dithiothreitol. The reaction was stopped by boiling the samples for 3 min in electrophoresis sample buffer. Then the phosphorylation status of HA-Reg11–443 was analyzed by SDS-PAGE and immunoblot. When potential phosphatase inhibitors were assayed, different amounts of the purified inhibitors were incubated with the purified phosphatases during 5 min at 30 °C, prior to the addition of the yeast crude extract. Measurement of Glycogen Content—Wild type strain JA100 containing plasmids pWS93 or pWS-Ypi1 were grown on YPD until the indicated absorbance at 660 nm and then ∼200 mg (wet weight) of fresh cells were collected by filtration. Cells were disrupted, and glycogen was measured essentially as in Ref. 47Arino J. Posas F. Clotet J. Methods Mol. Biol. 1998; 93: 305-313PubMed Google Scholar. Glucose released by glycogen hydrolysis was measured using a glucose-oxidase-based commercial kit. Phenotypic Analyses and Other Techniques—The effect of the overexpression of Ypi1 was monitored on plates by “drop tests” as previously described (48Posas F. Camps M. Arino J. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 13036-13041Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar). Briefly, cells were grown on SC medium lacking uracil for ∼48 h, and absorbance at 660 was measured and adjusted to 0.05. Serial dilutions (1:5) were made, and 3 μl of each dilution was deposited on the indicated culture media. To monitor recovery from α-factor arrest, strain JA110 (sit4) was transformed with plasmid pWS93 or pWS-Ypi1, and cells were grown until an absorbance at 660 nm of 0.6 was reached. Recovery from α factor arrest was performed as in Ref. 49Clotet J. Gari E. Aldea M. Arino J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 2408-2415Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar.

Yfr003c Belongs to a Highly Conserved Family of Proteins Including a PP1 Protein Phosphatase Inhibitor—YFR003c encodes a small protein (155 residues; 18 kDa, estimated molecular mass) very rich in hydrophilic residues (Asp + Glu content 19.4%; Ser + Thr content 14.8%; Lys + Arg content 16.8%) that shows an aberrant mobility in SDS-PAGE (it runs as a protein of around 30 kDa) and that is heat-stable (see below). All of these properties make this protein very similar to PP1 phosphatase inhibitors described in mammalian cells (16Cohen P.T. J. Cell Sci. 2002; 115: 241-256Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 17Aggen J.B. Nairn A.C. Chamberlin R. Chem. Biol. 2000; 7: R13-R23Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar). A protein BLAST analysis revealed that Yfr003c was highly homologous to a family of small proteins, one of which has been described as PP1 phosphatase inhibitor (Fig. 1). In fact, Yfr003c was previously postulated as the putative yeast homologue of mammalian PP1 inhibitor-3 (31Zhang J. Zhang L. Zhao S. Lee E.Y. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 16728-16734Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). It is also important to notice that Yfr003c was strongly conserved throughout all eukaryotes, with homologues in yeast, insects, plants, worms, and mammals. Fig. 1A shows a phylogenetic tree of all of the Yfr003c homologues using the Genebee service (available on the World Wide Web at www.genebee.msu.su). The Yfr003c Gene Product Interacts Physically with Glc7 and the PP1-related Phosphatase Ppz1—The yeast protein encoded by YFR003c (hereafter referred to YPI1, for yeast phosphatase inhibitor 1) was initially identified in a two-hybrid screening searching for Glc7-interacting proteins using LexA-Glc7 as bait (32Tu J. Song W. Carlson M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 4199-4206Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). Yeast two-hybrid global analyses have also shown protein-protein interaction between Ypi1 and Glc7 (33Uetz P. Giot L. Cagney G. Mansfield T.A. Judson R.S. Knight J.R. Lockshon D. Narayan V. Srinivasan M. Pochart P. Qureshi-Emili A. Li Y. Godwin B. Conover D. Kalbfleisch T. Vijayadamodar G. Yang M. Johnston M. Fields S. Rothberg J.M.

To verify this interaction by an alternative experimental approach, we used an affinity pull-down assay system based on the expression of a GST-Glc7 fusion protein in bacteria. Purified GST-Glc7 was then used to bind HA-tagged-Ypi1 expressed in yeast cells. As shown in Fig. 2A (lane 2), HA-Ypi1 was detected in the fraction retained by GST-Glc7, corroborating the specific interaction between Glc7 and Ypi1. These results were in agreement with those presented recently on the interaction of Yfr003c (Ypi1) and Glc7 by affinity precipitation"
https://openalex.org/W2119979452,"Chromogranins A and B (CGA and CGB) are high capacity, low affinity calcium (Ca2+) storage proteins found in many cell types most often associated with secretory granules of secretory cells but also with the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) lumen of these cells. Both CGA and CGB associate with inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate receptor (InsP3R) in a pH-dependent manner. At an intraluminal pH of 5.5, as found in secretory vesicles, both CGA and CGB bind to the InsP3R. When the intraluminal pH is 7.5, as found in the ER, CGA totally dissociates from InsP3R, whereas CGB only partially dissociates. To investigate the functional consequences of the interaction between the InsP3R and CGB monomers or CGA/CGB heteromers, purified mouse InsP3R type I were fused to planar lipid bilayers and activated by 2 μm InsP3. In the presence of luminal CGB monomers or CGA/CGB heteromers the InsP3R/Ca2+ channel open probability and mean open time increased significantly. The channel activity remained elevated when the pH was changed to 7.5, a reflection of CGB binding to the InsP3R even at pH 7.5. These results suggest that CGB may play an important modulatory role in the control of Ca2+ release from the ER. Furthermore, the difference in the ability of CGA and CGB to regulate the InsP3R/Ca2+ channel and the variability of CGA/CGB ratios could influence the pattern of InsP3-mediated Ca2+ release.

It is found in the large dense core secretory granules and in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) lumen of most neurons, exo/endocrine cells, and neuroendocrine cells and shows a wide distribution in various areas of the brain (1.Weiler R. Marksteiner J. Bellmann R. Wohlfarter T. Schober M. Fischer-Colbrie R. Sperk G. Winkler H. Brain Res. 1990; 532: 87-94Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). Levels of CGB expression in cells can be used as markers for a number of physiological and medically important pathophysiological conditions (2.Lamberts S.W. Hofland L.J. Nobels F.R. Front. Neuroendocrinol. 2001; 22: 309-339Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar, 3.Mahata S.K. Marksteiner J. Sperk G. Mahata M. Gruber B. Fischer-Colbrie R. Winkler H. Brain Res. Mol.

In normal brain tissue CGB expression is enhanced after neuronal activation, providing a marker for stimulated neurons (3.Mahata S.K. Marksteiner J. Sperk G. Mahata M. Gruber B. Fischer-Colbrie R. Winkler H. Brain Res. Mol. Brain Res. 1992; 16: 1-12Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). In addition to the tissue-specific distribution, a regionally specific distribution of CGB has been found intracellularly in neuronally differentiated pheochromocytoma (PC12) cells (5.Johenning F.W. Zochowski M. Conway S.J. Holmes A.B. Koulen P. Ehrlich B.E. J. Neurosci. 2002; 22: 5344-5353Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In these cells CGB levels are elevated in the neurites rather than in the soma, which correlates with the initiation site for intracellular calcium (Ca2+) signals. The levels of CGB and chromogranin-derived peptides can be diagnostic markers for pathophysiological conditions. For example, levels of CGB are greatly reduced in the cerebro-spinal fluid of chronic schizophrenia subjects (6.Zhang B. Tan Z. Zhang C. Shi Y. Lin Z. Gu N. Feng G. He L. Neurosci. Lett. 2002; 323: 229-233Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar, 7.Landen M. Grenfeldt B. Davidsson P. Stridsberg M. Regland B. Gottfries C.G. Blennow K. Eur.

Moreover, the levels of CGB and chromogranin-derived peptides are diagnostically significant as neuronal markers for synaptic degeneration in Alzheimer's disease (4.Marksteiner J. Kaufmann W.A.

At the cellular level CGB is believed to have many intra- and extracellular functions. CGB functions as a heparin binding extracellular matrix protein, mediating adhesion of cells and supporting neurite outgrowth (8.Chen M. Tempst P. Yankner B.A. J. Neurochem. 1992; 58: 1691-1698Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). CGB is a prohormone with numerous di- and tribasic amino acid cleavage sites that act as targets for proteolytic enzymes such as the prohormone convertase (9.Strub J.M. Sorokine O. Van Dorsselaer A.

Neuroscience. 1992; 49: 497-528Crossref PubMed Scopus (613) Google Scholar). Furthermore, chromogranin B is known to bind >90 mol of Ca2+/mol with a dissociation constant (Kd) of 1.5 mm (11.Yoo S. Oh Y. Kang M. Huh Y. So S. Park H. Park H. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 45806-45812Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar), distinguishing itself as a very efficient Ca2+ storage protein. Intracellularly, CGB has also been suggested to participate in packaging and sorting other proteins into the secretory vesicles of neuroendocrine cells, thus playing key roles in secretory granule biogenesis (12.Gorr S.U. Shioi J. Cohn D.V. Am. J. Physiol. 1989; 257: E247-E254PubMed Google Scholar, 13.Yoo S.H. Albanesi J.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 13446-13448Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 14.Chanat E. Huttner W.B. J. Cell Biol. 1991; 115: 1505-1519Crossref PubMed Scopus (392) Google Scholar). Indeed, CGB has recently been shown to induce secretory granule biogenesis (15.Huh Y.H. Jeon S.H. Yoo S.H. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 40581-40589Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar). CGB also localizes to the nucleus and controls transcription of many genes, including those for transcription factors (16.Yoo S.H. You S.H. Kang M.K. Huh Y.H. Lee C.S. Shim C.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 16011-16021Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). In secretory granules both CGA and CGB have been shown to interact with the InsP3R at the intravesicular pH of 5.5 (11.Yoo S. Oh Y. Kang M. Huh Y. So S. Park H. Park H. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 45806-45812Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar, 17.Yoo S.H. Trends Neurosci. 2000; 23: 424-428Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). Purified InsP3R interacts directly with CGA and CGB at pH 5.5. CGA dissociates from the InsP3R at pH 7.5, whereas CGB remains partially associated (18.Yoo S.H. So S.H. Kweon H.S. Lee J.S. Kang M.K. Jeon C.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 12553-12559Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). Both chromogranin proteins form a complex with the InsP3R in vivo (11.Yoo S. Oh Y. Kang M. Huh Y. So S. Park H. Park H. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 45806-45812Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). The functional aspect of this coupling has been investigated for CGA alone using single channel experiments and Ca2+ flux studies (19.Thrower E. Park H. So S. Yoo S. Ehrlich B. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 15801-15806Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). In the presence of CGA the open probability and mean open time of the InsP3R channel increases 10-fold. Despite the role of secretory granules of secretory cells and ER as major InsP3-sensitive intracellular Ca2+ stores (13.Yoo S.H. Albanesi J.P. J. Biol.

Neuroscience. 1992; 49: 497-528Crossref PubMed Scopus (613) Google Scholar) and a variety of other cell types (1.Weiler R. Marksteiner J. Bellmann R. Wohlfarter T. Schober M. Fischer-Colbrie R. Sperk G. Winkler H. Brain Res. 1990; 532: 87-94Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar), the functional interaction of InsP3R and CGB is less well characterized. Given also the tendency of CGA/CGB mixture to spontaneously form a CGA/CGB heterodimer at a near physiological pH 7.5 and a CGA2CGB2 heterotetramer at the intragranular pH 5.5 (22.Yoo S.H. Lewis M.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 17041-17046Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar), it is important to understand the effects of CGB and CGA/CGB heteromers. In this study, we examined the effect of CGB and CGA/CGB heteromers on the channel gating properties of the InsP3R type I. CGB increased the open probability and mean open time of the channel by almost 20-fold. However, in contrast to CGA, this functional effect was less sensitive to changes in pH when compared with the effect of CGA alone. These results show the functional interaction of InsP3R with CGB monomers and CGA/CGB heteromers and suggest that regulation of these interactions plays a physiologically important role in determining the pattern of InsP3-mediated Ca2+ release. Antibody—An InsP3R peptide specific to terminal 10–13 amino acids of type 1 (HPPHMNVNPQQPA) was synthesized with a carboxyl-terminal cysteine, and anti-rabbit polyclonal antibody was raised. The polyclonal anti-rabbit antibody was affinity-purified on the immobilized peptide following the procedure described (23.Yoo S.H. J. Biol.

FEBS Lett. 1997; 406: 259-262Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar) were amplified by PCR and subcloned into vector pGEX-5T (Amersham Biosciences). GST-CGA and GST-CGB fusion proteins were expressed in Escherichia coli BL21 cells and purified on glutathione-agarose beads. The binding reactions were carried out either in a pH 5.5 buffer (20 mm sodium acetate, pH 5.5, 0.1 m KCl, 2 mm CaCl2, and 0.1% Triton X-100) or in a pH 7.5 buffer (20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 0.1 m KCl, 2 mm CaCl2, and 0.1% Triton X-100), and the interaction was determined by incubating an excess amount of purified GST-CGA or -CGB fusion protein (20 μg) with the purified InsP3R (0.5–0.7 μg) in 0.5 ml of buffer supplemented with 1× protease inhibitor mixture (Roche Applied Science) for 1 h at 4 °C. After incubation the reaction mixture was rinsed with 0.5 ml of buffer to remove unbound proteins. Elution of the bound InsP3R was carried out by using three bed volumes of the pH 7.5 buffer but with 1 m KCl. The eluted InsP3R was resolved on a 7.5% SDS-polyacrylamide gel and identified by chemiluminescence-based immunoblot analysis using the affinity-purified InsP3R antibody. Purification of the InsP3R—For flux studies the InsP3R type I was isolated from bovine cerebella as described previously (26.Yoo S.H. Jeon C.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 15067-15073Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). Briefly, bovine cerebella were mixed with 3 volumes of buffer I (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 0.32 m sucrose, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm β-mercaptoethanol, 0.1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 10 μm leupeptin, 10 μm pepstatin), homogenized, and centrifuged at 2000 × g for 10 min at 4 °C. The supernatants were re-centrifuged at 105000 × g for 1 h to precipitate the membrane pellet, which was resuspended in buffer II (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm β-mercaptoethanol, 0.1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 10 μm leupeptin, 10 μm pepstatin) containing 1% Triton X-100, stirred for 1 h, and then centrifuged at 32000 × g for 1 h at 4 °C. The resulting supernatant was mixed with an equal volume of buffer III (20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 0.1 m NaCl, 1% Triton X-100, 1 mm β-mercaptoethanol, 0.1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 10 μm leupeptin, 10 μm pepstatin) and applied to an InsP3R antibody-coupled immunoaffinity column (0.35 × 1 cm) equilibrated with 20 mm HEPES, pH 7.5, 100 mm NaCl, 1 mm CaCl2. The protein-loaded column was washed with 20 bed volumes of this buffer, and the InsP3R was eluted by 10 ml of elution buffer (0.1 m glycine, pH 2.8, 0.2% Triton X-100, 0.5 m NaCl, 1 mm β-mercaptoethanol, 0.1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 10 μm leupeptin, 10 μm pepstatin). The eluate was immediately neutralized by adding 1 m Tris-HCl, pH 9.5, and mixed with an equal volume of buffer IV (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 0.2% Triton X-100, 0.5 m NaCl, 1 mm β-mercaptoethanol) and then applied to a benzamidine-Sepharose column equilibrated with buffer (20 mm HEPES, pH 7.5, 100 mm NaCl, 1 m KCl, and 3 m urea). InsP3R-containing flow-through was collected and stored at –70 °C until use. For bilayer experiments the InsP3R type I was solubilized in 1% CHAPS and purified from mouse cerebellum using heparin affinity and Con-A-Sepharose column chromatography, as described previously (27.Thrower E.C. Mobasheri H. Dargan S. Marius P. Lea E.J. Dawson A.P. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 36049-36055Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). The purified InsP3R was then incorporated into liposomes by the addition of 15 μg of purified protein to 1 ml of liposome solution (consisting of phosphatidylcholine in bilayer buffer), mixing, and then incubating on ice for 10 min. Flux Studies—InsP3R proteoliposomes were formed as described previously (26.Yoo S.H. Jeon C.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 15067-15073Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). Flux experiments were carried out using three types of proteoliposomes at both pH 5.5 and 7.5. Proteoliposomes either had 1) CGB encapsulated in them, 2) CGA and CGB encapsulated in them at the molar ratio of 1:1, or 3) no added chromogranin to be used for control experiments. Ca2+ efflux from the proteoliposomes was measured by observing changes in indo-1 fluorescence. Fluorometric measurements were carried out at 35 °C by using a Shimadzu RF-5301 PC spectrofluorometer equipped with a temperature-controlled cuvette holder. Fluorescence intensity was measured at the emission wavelength of 393 nm (excitation of 355 nm) with 10 nm of excitation band slit width and 10 nm of emission band slit width. For the kinetic analysis of InsP3-induced Ca2+ release, the data were acquired every 20 ms after each addition of the indicated InsP3 concentration to 0.5 ml of the proteoliposome solution. The fluorescent intensities of indo-1 were calibrated to free Ca2+ concentrations using a Ca2+-EGTA buffering system (28.Tsien R. Pozzan T. Methods Enzymol. 1989; 172: 230-262Crossref PubMed Scopus (397) Google Scholar). Fluorescence intensity after the addition of Triton X-100 was used to determine total intravesicular Ca2+. Potassium Iodide Quench Analysis—For the collisional fluorescence quenching of Trp residues in InsP3R by iodide, a varying amount of KI up to 0.16 m final was added to the reaction mixtures while maintaining the total concentration of KI plus KCl constant, and the fluorescence intensity at the emission wavelength of 340 nm was measured with the excitation at 295 nm at 35 °C. Bilayer Experiments—Planar lipid bilayers were formed by painting a solution of phosphatidylethanolamine/phosphatidylserine (3:1; 30 mg/ml in decane) across a 100-μm aperture in a Teflon sheet bisecting a Lucite chamber. The hole was pre-painted with phosphatidylcholine/phosphatidylserine (3:1) before membrane formation. The two compartments are defined cis (corresponding to the cytosol) and trans (corresponding to the lumen of the ER). The cis (cytosolic) compartment consisted of 250 mm HEPES-Tris, pH 7.35, 0.5 mm EGTA, 300 nm [Ca2+]free, 0.5 mm ATP, 2 μm ruthenium red. The trans (luminal) compartment consisted of 250 mm HEPES adjusted to pH 5.5 (because purified InsP3R was used in these experiments the pH could be changed using 70 mm HCl) and 53 mm BaOH2. Single channel currents were amplified using a bilayer clamp amplifier (Warner Instruments) and recorded on digital tape. Data were filtered with an eight-pole Bessel filter to 500 Hz, digitized to 2 KHz, transferred to a personal computer, and analyzed using pClamp 9.0 (Axon Instruments) software package. InsP3R proteoliposomes were added to the cis compartment and mixed followed by the addition of 2 μm InsP3 to the same compartment. Upon InsP3R activation, single channel activity was recorded. Either CGB (1 μg) or a mixture of CGA/CGB (1 μg) was added to the trans compartment and mixed. InsP3R single channel activity was recorded. The pH inside the trans compartment was changed by the addition of Tris (final concentration 110 mm) to pH 7.5, and InsP3R single channel activity was recorded. These experiments were repeated in the presence of increasing concentrations of InsP3 (over the range 0.2–2 μm) to the cis compartment and carried out in the presence and absence of 1 μg of CGB or the CGA/CGB mixture in the trans compartment at pH 5.5. InsP3R single channel activity was recorded. Because CGB does not completely dissociate from the InsP3R at pH 7.5, the InsP3 concentration-response was repeated in the presence of luminal CGB or the CGA/CGB mixture at this pH. All data are presented as the mean ± S.E. of at least four similar experiments. pH-dependent Interaction of InsP3R with CGA, CGB, and CGA/CGB—To determine whether there was a direct interaction between the purified InsP3R and CGA or CGB, GST fusion forms of CGA and CGB were expressed in E. coli BL21 and purified. The interaction between the InsP3R and GST-CGA and -CGB fusion proteins was examined at pH 5.5 and 7.5 (Fig. 1). As shown in Fig. 1 (left side of the figure), CGA, CGB, and a mixture of CGA and CGB (CGA/CGB) all interacted with the InsP3R at pH 5.5. When tested at pH 7.5 CGA failed to interact with the InsP3R (Fig. 1, right side), but CGB still interacted with the InsP3R, albeit at a reduced level (Fig. 1, right side), reflecting a stronger affinity of CGB for the InsP3R. Effects of CGB and CGA/CGB on InsP3-mediated Ca2+Release—Ca2+ release studies were employed to investigate the effects of CGB on the InsP3 concentration-response for InsP3R type I. As previously described for CGA (19.Thrower E. Park H. So S. Yoo S. Ehrlich B. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 15801-15806Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar), InsP3-induced Ca2+ release from InsP3R-reconstituted liposomes was monitored at two different pH values both in the presence and absence of CGB (Fig. 2A). InsP3-induced Ca2+ efflux was determined using proteoliposomes containing 300 μm Ca2+. The total amount of InsP3-releasable Ca2+ was estimated to be 62–70%. The InsP3-induced Ca2+ release obtained in the absence of CGB gave a Kapp value for InsP3 of 0.68 μm. When CGB was present inside the vesicle at pH 5.5, the pH value at which CGA and CGB coupled with the InsP3R (18.Yoo S.H. So S.H. Kweon H.S. Lee J.S. Kang M.K. Jeon C.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 12553-12559Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar), InsP3-induced Ca2+ release was markedly enhanced (see Fig. 2A), yielding a Kapp value for InsP3 of 0.16 μm. Interestingly, when the pH was maintained at 7.5, the fluxes measured at each InsP3 concentration were similar to those seen at pH 5.5 in the presence of CGB (Kapp value for InsP3 of 0.17 μm). This result is distinct from that obtained with CGA where pH had a profound effect, and the response at pH 7.5 was similar to that measured in the absence of CGA (19.Thrower E. Park H. So S. Yoo S. Ehrlich B. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 15801-15806Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). Ca2+ release from the InsP3R-reconstituted liposomes was also monitored in the presence of an equimolar mixture of CGA/CGB (Fig. 2B). The Kapp value for InsP3 was approximately the same in the presence of the mixtures as that measured in the presence of CGB alone (Kapp value for InsP3 was 0.15 μm at pH 5.5 and 0.18 μm at pH 7.5). Changes in InsP3R Conformation—To investigate possible conformational changes of the InsP3R by its interaction with monomeric CGB or a heteromeric CGA/CGB, we utilized collisional quenching of the intrinsic tryptophan (Trp) fluorescence of the InsP3R by iodide (Fig. 3). By determining the extent of quenching it was possible to determine whether the Trp environment of the InsP3R is changed as a result of a change in the InsP3R conformation. As shown in Fig. 3, the InsP3R Trp fluorescence was quenched by iodide in the presence of both CGB or the CGA/CGB mixture. The emission fluorescence at 340 nm was measured, and the results were plotted according to the Stern-Volmer equation (29.Eftink M.R. Ghiron C.A. Anal. Biochem. 1981; 114: 199-227Crossref PubMed Scopus (1632) Google Scholar), Fo – F = Ksv[I–] + 1, where Fo is the emission intensity in the absence of iodide, F is the intensity in the presence of iodide, Ksv is the Stern-Volmer quenching constant, and [I–] is the molar concentration of iodide. The Ksv value estimated from the slope was 2.94 m–1 for the reconstituted InsP3R in the absence of CGB. When CGB was present, this value decreased to 2.51 and 1.55 m–1 at the intraliposomal pH 7.5 and 5.5, respectively (Fig. 3A). From this experiment it is clear that at least some Trp residues of the InsP3R are less exposed to the solvent when CGB is present, demonstrating the CGB-induced conformational changes of the InsP3R. Furthermore, the Ksv values suggest that the Trp residues are less exposed when the intraliposomal pH was maintained at 5.5 than at 7.5. There also were conformational changes of the InsP3R in the presence of a CGA/CGB mixture in the liposome (Fig. 3B). The Ksv value of 3.11 in the absence of CGA/CGB was decreased to 2.25 and 2.06 m–1 at the intraliposomal pH 7.5 and 5.5, respectively, in the presence of the CGA/CGB mixture, indicating the conformational changes of the InsP3R in the presence of CGA/CGB. Effects of CGB and CGA/CGB on InsP3R Channel Activity— The effects of CGB and CGA/CGB on InsP3R function were investigated at the single channel level using InsP3R incorporated into planar lipid bilayers. In the absence of luminal CGB and in the presence of cytosolic-free Ca2+ (300 nm) and InsP3 (2 μm) InsP3R single channel activity was observed (see Fig. 4A, trace iii). Single channel currents of ∼2 pA were seen, and a single population of mean open times was obtained with a value that ranged between 5.2 and 8.6 ms (Fig. 4B, top panel; Table I). The open probability (Po) was 5 ± 1% (n = 4; Table II).Table IThe effect of the chromogranins on the mean open time of the InsP3RControl (-CGA pH 5.5)+CGA pH 5.5+CGA pH 7.5msmsms8.6 ± 0.53.3 ± 0.0710.0 ± 0.0371.7 ± 0.08Control (-CGB pH 5.5)+CGB pH 5.5+ CGB pH 7.5msmsms5.2 ± 1.53.1 ± 0.34.8 ± 0.6217.4 ± 0.3122.5 ± 0.7Control (-CGA/CGB pH 5.5)+CGA/CGB pH 5.5+CGA/CGB pH 7.5msmsms7.2 ± 0.211.1 ± 0.47.4 ± 0.384.4 ± 0.3120.9 ± 0.3 Open table in a new tab Table IIThe effect of the chromogranins on the open probability of the InsP3RControl (-CGA pH 5.5)+CGA pH 5.5+CGA pH 7.5%%%4.0 ± 1.033.0 ± 8.53.0 ± 1.6Control (-CGB pH 5.5)+CGB pH 5.5+CGB pH 7.5%%%5.0 ± 1.080.0 ± 9.040.0 ± 2.0Control (-CGA/CGB pH 5.5)+CGA/CGB pH 5.5+CGA/CGB pH 7.5%%%3.0 ± 1.077.0 ± 3.048.0 ± 2.0 Open table in a new tab After the addition of 1 μg of CGB to the luminal compartment a dramatic increase in channel activity was observed (Fig. 4A, trace ii). Although the size of the single channel current remained unaltered, significant differences in mean open times and Po were seen. Two populations of mean open time were apparent, but the values were noticeably increased over control values (Fig. 4B, middle panel). Although the short open time remained in the same range as control values, a new, longer open time was evident that was at least 10-times larger than the open time observed under control conditions (3.1 ± 0.3 and 217.4 ± 0.3 ms are the open times in the presence of CGB; Table I). Furthermore, the Po increased from 5% in control conditions to 80 ± 9% (n = 4; Table II) in the presence of CGB. After changing the pH of the luminal compartment to pH 6.5, a condition causing partial dissociation of CGB from the InsP3R, the Po was reduced to 63 ± 2%. Although this is a decrease in channel activity, the Po was still elevated when compared with control levels (Fig. 4A, trace iv). A further change in luminal pH to 7.5 (Fig. 4A, trace v) caused the Po to fall even further, but the value of 40 ± 2% still exceeded control levels, indicating that CGB remained coupled to the InsP3R. The mean open times were reduced to 4.8 ± 0.6 and 122 ± 0.7 ms (n = 4; Fig. 4B, bottom panel and Table I). Addition of heparin, an InsP3R-specific antagonist, to the cytoplasmic compartment inhibited channel activity completely (Fig. 4A, trace vi). In the next series of experiments a mixture of CGA/CGB was tested. In the absence of CGA/CGB the amplitude of the single channel currents was 2 pA (see Fig. 5A, trace ii), the Po was 3.0 ± 1.0% (n = 4), and the mean open time was similar to that obtained in the previous control experiments (7.2 ± 0.2 ms). After the addition of 1 μg of CGA/CGB to the luminal compartment (pH 5.5) a large increase in channel activity was observed (Fig. 5A, trace iii). The Po was 77% ± 3% (n = 4), and two populations of mean open time were evident (11.1 ± 0.4 and 84.4 ± 0.3 ms; Table I). Although the values for the open times were increased over control values (Fig. 5B, top panel) the longer population of mean open times was less than that seen with CGB alone and more closely resembled that seen with CGA alone. A subsequent change in the luminal pH to 7.5 (Fig. 5A, trace iv) caused Po to fall, but the value of 48 ± 2% again exceeded control levels. The elevated Po indicates a continued coupling of CGA/CGB with the InsP3R, potentially via the CGB component of the heteromer. The mean open times were 7.3 ± 0.3 and 120.9 ± 0.3 ms, values closer to CGB alone at pH 7.5 (n = 4; Fig. 5B, bottom panel; Table I). The addition of heparin to the cytoplasmic compartment inhibited channel activity completely (Fig. 5A, trace v). As with previous studies demonstrating the effect of CGA on the activity of the InsP3R (19.Thrower E. Park H. So S. Yoo S. Ehrlich B. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 15801-15806Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar), several control experiments were done. 1) The addition of CGB or CGA/CGB in the absence of cytosolic InsP3 did not potentiate any InsP3R channel activity; 2) the addition of CGB or CGA/CGB to the luminal compartment in the absence of InsP3R had no effect upon the bilayer currents; 3) the addition of CGB or CGA/CGB to the cytoplasmic compartment in the presence of InsP3R and InsP3 did not affect channel activity. Effect of CGB or CGA/CGB on the InsP3 Concentration-Response for InsP3R—Single channel activity was observed over a range of InsP3 concentrations both in the presence of CGB at pH 5.5 and 7.5 and in its absence (Fig. 6A). Starting at an InsP3 concentration of 0.2 μm, the Po was greater in the presence of CGB (luminal pH 5.5) when compared with control levels, with an ∼18-fold increase in Po at 2 μm InsP3 (Fig. 6A, middle panel). At pH 7.5 (Fig. 6A, right panel) the channel again has a higher Po at the lower InsP3 concentration range, although at 2 μm InsP3 the Po is less than that observed at pH 5.5. Similar experiments to examine the InsP3 concentration dependence were done in the presence of the CGA/CGB heteromer (Fig. 6B). Again, in the presence of CGA/CGB, over a range of InsP3 concentrations starting at 0.2 μm, the open probability was greater in the presence of CGA/CGB (luminal pH 5.5) when compared with control levels (Fig. 6B, middle panel). Repetition of the experiment at pH 7.5 (Fig. 6B, right panel) indicated that the Po at the lower InsP3 concentrations were similar to those seen for CGA/CGB at pH 5.5, but at 2 μm InsP3 the Po was less at pH 7.5 than that seen at pH 5.5. The InsP3 concentration dependence of channel activity after the addition of either CGB or the mixture of CGA/CGB was compared at pH 5.5 and 7.5 (Fig. 7). Regardless of the pH used the effect of CGB alone or CGA/CGB was similar (Fig. 7), suggesting that the properties of CGB, especially the ability to bind to the InsP3R at pH 7.5, predominates. In the present study we examined the functional interaction between the InsP3R type I and CGB monomers or CGA/CGB heteromers and found that both CGB and CGA/CGB heteromers enhanced activation of the InsP3R/Ca2+ channel in the presence of InsP3. A direct physical interaction between the InsP3R and CGA or CGB was demonstrated (17.Yoo S.H. Trends Neurosci. 2000; 23: 424-428Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar), and the molecules co-localized in intact cells (5.Johenning F.W. Zochowski M. Conway S.J. Holmes A.B. Koulen P. Ehrlich B.E. J. Neurosci. 2002; 22: 5344-5353Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Furthermore, a mixture of CGA/CGB interacted with the purified InsP3R at both pH 5.5 and 7.5, although the interaction at pH 7.5 was markedly reduced compared with that at pH 5.5 (Fig. 1). The stronger interaction between the InsP3R and the chromogranins at acidic pH is consistent with the physiological roles of secretory granules because the intragranular pH of secretory granules decreases and the Ca2+ content increases as the granules move from the trans-Golgi network to the plasma membrane. The interaction of the InsP3R with CGB monomers and with CGA/CGB heterotetramers at pH 5.5 elicited an open probability for the InsP3-gated Ca2+ channel of 80 and 77%, respectively, which is the highest activity of the InsP3R observed to date in a bilayer. This functional interaction at pH 5.5 is likely related to the association of these proteins in secretory granules (18.Yoo S.H. So S.H. Kweon H.S. Lee J.S. Kang M.K. Jeon C.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 12553-12559Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). An elevation of intracellular Ca2+ is necessary for the process of fusion and exocytosis of secretory vesicles, and it is likely that the InsP3R/CGB interaction assists in this process. As the vesicles mature, the intraluminal pH becomes more acidic, and the Ca2+ is elevated (30.Winkler H. Westhead E. Neuroscience. 1980; 5: 1803-1823Crossref PubMed Scopus (371) Google Scholar). The mature vesicles accumulate near the plasma membrane, and exocytosis is more likely to occur for more acidic secretory granules (30.Winkler H. Westhead E. Neuroscience. 1980; 5: 1803-1823Crossref PubMed Scopus (371) Google Scholar). The increased association between CGB and the InsP3R as the vesicles mature will enhance the probability of exocytosis because the protein complex shows an increased sensitivity of the InsP3R to activation by InsP3. This enhanced channel activity will quickly release Ca2+ into the microregion between the vesicle and the plasma membrane where the fusion apparatus awaits the Ca2+ required for exocytosis. The functional interaction between the InsP3R and CGB remains even when the pH is at a near physiological level, suggesting that this protein association has roles in numerous locations in a cell. The addition of CGB or CGA/CGB heteromers to the InsP3R at pH 7.5 elicited an open probability of 40 and 48%, respectively. Again, the level of activation at this pH was elevated from those reported previously when using isolated InsP3R (31.Tang T. Tu H. Wang Z. Bezprozvanny I. J. Neurosci. 2003; 23: 403-415Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 32.Leite M.F. Thrower E.C. Echevarria W. Koulen P. Hirata K. Bennett A.M. Ehrlich B.E. Nathanson M.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2003; 100: 2975-2980Crossref PubMed Scopus (183) Google Scholar). The association between the InsP3R and CGB at pH 7.5 can have important regulatory roles in the ER, where CGB is found intraluminally and the InsP3R is associated with the ER membrane. Although the distribution of the InsP3R is assumed to be relatively homogeneous, CGB has been shown to be distributed in a regionally specific manner, as seen in neuronally differentiated PC12 cells (5.Johenning F.W. Zochowski M. Conway S.J. Holmes A.B. Koulen P. Ehrlich B.E. J. Neurosci. 2002; 22: 5344-5353Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In these cells CGB is preferentially localized to the neurites, which is the region where intracellular Ca2+ signals initiate (5.Johenning F.W. Zochowski M. Conway S.J. Holmes A.B. Koulen P. Ehrlich B.E. J. Neurosci. 2002; 22: 5344-5353Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). It is likely that this scenario will be found in other cell types as additional signaling microdomains are identified, and the association of CGB with the InsP3R may become an important modulator and amplifier of intracellular Ca2+ signaling. Interestingly, the effect of adding a mixture of CGA/CGB is the same as adding CGB alone. When mixed in vitro, CGA and CGB form a CGA-CGB heterodimer at pH 7.5 and a CGA2CGB2 heterotetramer at pH 5.5 (22.Yoo S.H. Lewis M.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 17041-17046Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). In the experiments presented here the response of the InsP3-gated channel was similar after the addition of CGB alone or a mixture of CGA/CGB at a ratio of 1:1 or 10:1. Unlike CGA, which dissociated completely from the InsP3R at pH 7.5 (18.Yoo S.H. So S.H. Kweon H.S. Lee J.S. Kang M.K. Jeon C.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 12553-12559Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar) and was without any activating effect on the InsP3R/Ca2+ channel (19.Thrower E. Park H. So S. Yoo S. Ehrlich B. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 15801-15806Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar), the InsP3R/Ca2+ channel-activating effect of CGB at pH 7.5 implies an important physiological role. Because the ratios of CGA to CGB vary among cells (10.Winkler H. Fischer-Colbrie R. Neuroscience. 1992; 49: 497-528Crossref PubMed Scopus (613) Google Scholar) and the intraluminal pH levels of the organelles in which CGA and CGB are found also differ, the InsP3R/Ca2+ channel-activating roles of CGA and CGB will also differ. We suggest, therefore, that the different ratios of CGA to CGB found in cells could be very important in modulating the time needed to achieve maturity in different Ca2+ storage organelles because the pH dependence of the enhanced Ca2+ release will be diminished in CGB-containing vesicles. Similarly, this difference in the ability of CGA and CGB to regulate the InsP3R could influence the pattern of InsP3-mediated Ca2+ release as CGA/CGB ratios vary in different regions of the cell. In particular, the ability of CGB to activate the InsP3R/Ca2+ channel at pH 7.5 is likely to have a big impact on InsP3-mediated Ca2+ release from the ER. In conclusion, we have identified a functional interaction between the intracellular Ca2+ release channel, the InsP3R, with the Ca2+ storage protein, chromogranin. Interactions occur with CGB, CGA, and with CGA/CGB heteromers. In all of these cases the interactions elicit the highest increase in the purified InsP3R activity observed. Because these interactions can be modulated, the chromogranins have the potential to serve as robust amplifiers of Ca2+ release in a variety of cell types both from secretory granules and from the ER.

These results are incompatible with the notion that glutamate only increases the open probability of the anion pore associated with glutamate transporters and demonstrate unique gating mechanisms of EAAT-associated anion channels.

Each of these isoforms exhibits two separate transport processes: a stoichiometrically coupled cotransport of one glutamate with three Na+ ions and one H+, in countertransport to one K+ ion (10.Zerangue N.

Neurosci. 1998; 18: 9620-9628Crossref PubMed Google Scholar); and an anion conductance that appears to be pore-mediated. The EAAT-associated anion channel is currently thought to function as a glutamate-gated channel with a tight coupling of channel opening and closing to conformational changes of the corresponding carrier domain. In this model, only certain carrier conformations are associated with conducting anion pores, and the anion channel cycles between conducting and non-conducting states during transitions through various conformational states of the glutamate carrier (8.Arriza J.L.

Our results demonstrated that opening and closing of the EAAT-associated anion channels as well as the interaction with the glutamate uptake process are more complex than previously assumed. External glutamate modifies intrinsic properties of EAAT2- and EAAT4-associated anion channels such as anion selectivity and the rate constants of anion permeation. Moreover, EAAT4 anion channels exhibit voltage-dependent opening and closing transitions that are modified by glutamate. These results provide novel insights into the function of neurotransmitter transporters and illustrate similarities as well as differences between transporter-associated pores and ion channels.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESExpression of hEAAT2 and rEAAT4 in tsA201 and HEK293 Cells—A pcDNA3.1-hEAAT2 construct was generated by subcloning the coding region of hEAAT2 (16.Trotti D. Rolfs A. Danbolt N.C. Brown Jr., R.H. Hediger M.A. Nat. Neurosci. 1999; 2: 427-433Crossref PubMed Scopus (304) Google Scholar) (kindly provided by Dr. M. Hediger, Harvard Medical School, Boston) into a pcDNA3.1 vector (Invitrogen) using flanking NotI restriction sites. The pcDNA3.1-rEAAT4 construct was kindly provided by Dr. J. Rothstein, The Johns Hopkins University, Baltimore (17.Lin C.L. Tzingounis A.V. Jin L. Furuta A. Kavanaugh M.P. Rothstein J.D. Brain Res. 1998; 63: 174-179Google Scholar). Transient transfection of tsA201 cells using the Ca3(PO4)2 technique was performed as described previously (18.Hebeisen S. Heidtmann L. Cosmelli D. Gonzalez C. Latorre R. Alvarez O. Ch Fahlke Biophys. J. 2003; 84: 2306-2318Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). To identify cells with a high probability of expressing recombinant transporters, cells were cotransfected with a plasmid encoding the CD8 antigen and incubated 5 min before use with polystyrene microbeads precoated with anti-CD8 antibodies (Dynabeads M-450 CD8, Dynal, Great Neck, NY) (19.Jurman M.E. Boland L.M. Liu Y. Yellen G. BioTechniques. 1994; 17: 876-881PubMed Google Scholar). Only cells decorated with microbeads were used for electrophysiological recordings. By adjusting the CD8/EAAT cDNA ratio, we optimized our conditions so that almost every cell with beads exhibited a current component with characteristic properties shown in Fig. 1. For each construct, two independent recombinants were examined and exhibited indistinguishable functional properties. Oligoclonal cell lines stably expressing hEAAT2 were obtained by selection for resistance to the aminoglycoside antibiotic geneticin (G418, Roche Applied Science) as described previously (18.Hebeisen S. Heidtmann L. Cosmelli D. Gonzalez C. Latorre R. Alvarez O. Ch Fahlke Biophys. J. 2003; 84: 2306-2318Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). The stable cell lines so obtained exhibited electrical properties indistinguishable from transiently transfected tsA201 cells. Untransfected tsA201 cells displayed a negligible endogenous anion current component (current amplitude at –175 mV: Cl–, –54 ± 6 pA;NO3-, –63 ± 13 pA; SCN–, –56 ± 10 pA; at +125 mV: Cl–, 40 ± 3 pA;NO3-, 31 ± 3 pA; SCN–, 211 ± 13 pA, n > 5 cells) that was not modified by the addition of glutamate.Whole-cell Recordings—Standard whole-cell patch clamp recordings were performed using an Axopatch 200B (Axon Instruments, Union City, CA) or EPC10 (HEKA Electronics, Lambrecht, Germany) amplifier. Borosilicate pipettes were pulled with resistances of 1.0–2.2 megohms. More than 80% of the series resistance was compensated by an analog procedure resulting in calculated voltage errors <5 mV. Currents were filtered at 5 kHz and digitized with a sampling rate of 50 kHz using a Digidata (Axon Instruments) or an ITC-16 (HEKA) AD/DA converter. Cells were clamped to 0 mV for at least 2 s between test sweeps. The compositions of the standard solutions are as follows: extracellular (in mm) 140 NaCl, 4 KCl, 2 CaCl2, 1 MgCl2, 5 HEPES, pH 7.4; intracellular (in mm) 115 NaCl, 2 MgCl2, 5 EGTA, 10 HEPES, pH 7.4. For certain experiments, NaCl in the intra- or extracellular solution was equimolarly substituted with NaNO3, NaSCN, KCl, KNO3, or KSCN. Substrate-containing external solutions were made by adding 0.5 mm l-glutamate. Anion currents were recorded always under conditions that abolish stoichiometric glutamate current, i.e. in the absence of external glutamate or internal K+ (20.Bergles D.E. Tzingounis A.V. Jahr C.E. J. Neurosci. 2002; 22: 10153-10162Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). For determination of anion permeability and conductivity ratios for external anions, cells were moved into the stream of solutions containing various sodium salts (in mm) 140 NaX, 4 KCl, 2 CaCl2, 1 MgCl2, 5 HEPES, pH 7.4 (X denotes Cl–, I–,NO3-, and SCN–). To test for a concentration dependence of biionic reversal potentials (Fig. 4C), measurements were performed on cells internally dialyzed with (in mm) X NaNO3, 117-X sodium gluconate, 5 EGTA, 10 HEPES, pH 7.4, in an external solution containing (in mm): Y NaSCN, 150-Y sodium gluconate, 5 HEPES, pH 7.4 (ratio X/Y = 117:150). For the experiments shown in Fig. 5, solutions with various external [SCN–] were made by substituting NaSCN in the external standard solution with equimolar NaCl, as the Cl– conductance of EAAT2 is negligible compared with SCN– (Fig. 2). For all these experiments, we used external and/or internal agar salt bridges, made from a plastic tubing filled with 3 m KCl in 0.3% agar, to connect the Ag/AgCl electrode. Offset potentials determined at the end of each experiment, and junction potentials either calculated using the JPCalc software (Dr. P. Barry, University of South Wales, Sydney, Australia (21.Barry P.H. J. Neurosci. Methods. 1994; 51: 107-116Crossref PubMed Scopus (545) Google Scholar)) or directly measured (22.Neher E.

Current amplitudes were used without subtraction procedure, and all summary data are shown as means ± S.E. For statistical evaluation the Student's t test was used.To obtain current-voltage relationships in various internal or external anions, isochronal current amplitudes were determined 1 ms after the voltage step. Current ratios given in Fig. 4 were determined by dividing isochronal current amplitudes obtained from the same cell after application of 0.5 mm l-glutamate by the corresponding value before application of external substrate. For the determination of normalized current amplitudes as a mean of channel selectivity (Tables I and II), we divided current amplitudes in various external anions by the corresponding value determined from the same cell in aNO3--based external solution, rather than in a standard external solution to minimize errors introduced by dividing by the rather small current amplitudes of cells expressing EAAT2 in external Cl–. Reversal potentials were only used for further analysis when the cell exhibited a whole-cell conductance that was at least three times larger than the mean value for untransfected cells under identical conditions. Permeability ratios were calculated from reversal potential measurements under biionic conditions using the Goldman-Hodgkin-Katz equation as described (18.Hebeisen S. Heidtmann L. Cosmelli D. Gonzalez C. Latorre R. Alvarez O. Ch Fahlke Biophys. J. 2003; 84: 2306-2318Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar) (Tables I and II). Affinity constants (KD) (Fig. 5) were calculated by plotting isochronal current amplitudes versus [SCN–]e after a Lineweaver-Burk transformation and fitting a linear function with a least square routine with Excel (Microsoft) and Sigma Plot (Jandel Scientific). KD values were determined from individual cells, in the absence and in the presence of l-glutamate, and all KD values provided are means ± S.E. of 7 individual cells. The voltage dependence of the relative open probability (Fig. 7A) was determined by plotting the normalized instantaneous current amplitude at + 90 mV after 0.2-s prepulses to different voltages versus the preceding potential. Activation curves obtained in this manner were then fit with a single Boltzmann term plus a voltage-independent value (I(V) = I0/(1 + eV–V0.5/kV) + Pmin). To describe the time course of current inactivation, a sum of two exponentials and a time-independent value were fit to data recorded during a series of voltage steps from a holding potential of 0 mV (Fig. 7B). To describe the recovery from inactivation, we used a pulse protocol consisting of a 150-ms conditioning pulse to +160 mV, a hyperpolarizing prepulse (to potentials between –180 and –120 mV) of variable duration, and a fixed test step to +160 mV (Fig. 7C). The dependence of the peak current amplitude on the prepulse duration was fit with a single exponential giving the time constant of recovery from inactivation (Fig. 7D).Table IRelative permeabilities and conductivities for external anions Open table in a new tab Table IIRelative anion permeabilities for internal anions Open table in a new tab Fig. 7Time- and voltage-dependent changes of EAAT4-associated anion currents.A, voltage dependence of the relative open probability of the EAAT4 anion channels in the absence (•, n = 7) and in the presence of 0.5 mm glutamate (○, n = 7).

Currents were filtered at 10 kHz and digitized with a sampling rate of 50 kHz. Cells were held at the current reversal potential, and a series of 300 records was recorded by pulsing to a certain voltage. Pairs of subsequent records were then subtracted using the PulseTools software (HEKA Electronics, Lambrecht, Germany) to compute the experimental non-stationary ensemble variance (25.Heinemann S.H. Conti F. Methods Enzymol. 1992; 207: 131-148Crossref PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar). The variance determined in cells expressing EAAT4 was significantly larger than the background noise observed in non-transfected cells, and we observed a clear correlation between current and noise amplitudes determined at different cells. The amplitude of a current noise generated by the opening and closing of ion channels depends on the unitary current amplitude (i), the number of channels (N), and the absolute open probability (P) of the underlying channels (23.DeFelice L.J. DeFelice L.J. Introduction to Membrane Noise. Plenum Publishing Corp., New York1981: 291-323Google Scholar, 24.Sigworth F.J. J. Physiol.

The subtracted variances were sorted into current bins (25.Heinemann S.H. Conti F. Methods Enzymol. 1992; 207: 131-148Crossref PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar) and plotted versus the corresponding mean current amplitude (Fig. 6).

By using these two values we calculated the absolute open probabilities (P) at the holding potential by extrapolating the instantaneous macroscopic current amplitude (Iinst) and dividing this amplitude by the number of channels (N) and the single channel amplitude (i) as shown in Equation 4.P=IinstNi(Eq. 4) RESULTSEAAT-associated Anion Currents Are Active in the Absence of Transporter Substrate—Fig. 1 shows representative recordings from tsA201 cells expressing EAAT2 and EAAT4. Cells were intracellularly dialyzed with a potassium-free solution and extracellularly perfused with glutamate-free solutions with either Cl– (Fig. 1, A and D),NO3- (Fig. 1, B and E), or SCN– (Fig. 1, C and F) as main anions. These conditions eliminated the Glu/Na+/H+/K+ current component (20.Bergles D.E. Tzingounis A.V. Jahr C.E. J. Neurosci. 2002; 22: 10153-10162Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and allowed us to record anion currents in isolation. For cells expressing EAAT2, currents in external Cl– were small (current amplitude at +125 mV: 0.11 ± 0.02 nA, n = 16) (Fig. 1A). Substitution of Cl– byNO3- (Fig. 1B) or SCN– (Fig. 1C) increased the anion influx at positive potentials and also the chloride efflux at negative potentials. Cl– currents in cells expressing EAAT4 were larger than those in cells expressing EAAT2 (current amplitude at +125 mV: 0.27 ± 0.05 nA, n = 12) (Fig. 1D). Again, externalNO3- (Fig. 1E) and SCN– (Fig. 1F) enhanced the current amplitudes at negative and positive potentials as compared with recordings in external Cl–. Under all external anion compositions EAAT2- and EAAT4-associated anion currents rose instantaneously upon voltage steps to negative and positive potentials. The two isoforms differed in the time course of current responses to depolarizing voltage steps. Whereas EAAT4-associated currents decayed in a voltage- and time-dependent manner, such current relaxations could not be observed in cells expressing EAAT2 (Fig. 1).Fig. 2A shows the voltage dependence of the absolute EAAT2-associated current amplitudes for external Cl–, I–,NO3-, and SCN– in the absence of external glutamate. EAAT2 displayed a SCN > NO3 > I > Cl conductivity sequence (Table I). Fig. 2B presents averaged isochronal current amplitudes for cells intracellularly dialyzed with solutions containing Cl–,NO3-, and SCN– illustrating a higher conductivity also for intracellular polyatomic anions compared with Cl– (Table II). Permeability ratios from the reversal potentials obtained in these experiments revealed for EAAT2 a relative anion permeability sequence of PI > PSCN > PNO3 > PCl for external anions (Table I), and a PSCN > PNO3 > PCl sequence for internal anions (Table II). Similar experiments with EAAT4 (Fig. 2, C and D) demonstrated an SCN > NO3 > I > Cl conductivity and permeability sequence for external as well as for internal anions (Tables I and II).EAAT2- and EAAT4-associated anion currents differ in the relative anion conductivities as well as in the relative anion permeabilities (Tables I and II), in the absolute current amplitude (Fig. 2) and in the time and voltage dependence of the current amplitude. These differences dismiss the possibility that anion currents measured in the absence of glutamate are conducted by endogenous anion channels up-regulated by overexpression of EAAT transporters and provide evidence that anion pores are formed by EAAT proteins either in homomeric or in heteromeric complexes together with endogenous proteins.Transitions in the Glutamate Transport Cycle Modify EAAT-associated Anion Pathways—Application of external glutamate enhanced EAAT-associated anion currents and modified the underlying anion channels. Fig. 3 shows EAAT4-associated current amplitudes in the absence and in the presence of glutamate under two ionic compositions: NaCl-based internal and NaNO3-based external solutions (Fig. 3, A and C) and NaNO3-based internal and NaCl-based external solutions (Fig. 3, B and D). For both conditions, application of external glutamate caused about a 2-fold increase of the anion current amplitude (Fig. 3, C and D, and Fig. 4A). Similar increases of the anion current amplitude by glutamate are observed in cells expressing EAAT2 (Fig. 4A). This demonstrates that there is a substantial constitutive activity of EAAT anion channels in the absence of glutamate.Fig. 3Application of external glutamate increases macroscopic current amplitudes and modifies functional properties of EAAT anion channels.A and B, representative whole-cell current traces recorded from tsA201 cells expressing EAAT4 transporters intracellularly dialyzed with NaCl-based solution but perfused with aNO3--based solution (A), or from cells intracellularly dialyzed with aNO3--based solution in NaCl-based external solution (B) before and after external application of 0.5 mm glutamate.

For NaCl-based internal and NaNO3-based external solutions, there was a time-dependent current decrease at positive potentials (Fig. 3A). In contrast, for NaNO3-based internal and NaCl-based external solution, currents activated upon membrane hyperpolarization (Fig. 3B). Glutamate caused a change of the time and voltage dependence of currents for both anion conditions. Current inactivation was less pronounced in the presence of glutamate in externalNO3- (Fig. 3A), and for internalNO3- a time-dependent current decrease at negative potentials appeared after glutamate application (Fig. 3B). EAAT2 anion currents did not exhibit time-dependent changes of the current amplitude for external (Fig. 1) or for internalNO3- (data not shown).For EAAT2 and EAAT4, the glutamate-induced current increase depended on the anion composition. For cells intracellularly dialyzed with a NaCl-based internal solution, these values were highest forNO3- and smaller for SCN–, I–, and Cl– (Fig. 4A). Moreover, for various ionic conditions application of glutamate caused a significant shift of the reversal potential (Fig. 3, C and D, insets, Tables I and II). These shifts were not due to glutamate permeation through the anion pore, as glutamate caused shifts to more negative under certain conditions (Fig. 3C, inset) and shifts to more positive potentials under others (Fig. 3D, inset). They rather indicate an alteration of the relative anion permeability of EAAT2- and EAAT4-associated anion pathways by glutamate (Fig. 4B).Other steps in"
https://openalex.org/W1986152541,"Thioredoxin-dependent thiol peroxidase (Tpx) from Escherichia coli represents a group of antioxidant enzymes that are widely distributed in pathogenic bacterial species and which belong to the peroxiredoxin (Prx) family. Bacterial Tpxs are unique in that the location of the resolving cysteine (CR) is different from those of other Prxs. E. coli Tpx (EcTpx) shows substrate specificity toward alkyl hydroperoxides over H2O2 and is the most potent reductant of alkyl hydroperoxides surpassing AhpC and BCP, the other E. coli Prx members. Here, we present the crystal structure of EcTpx in the oxidized state determined at 2.2-Å resolution. The structure revealed that Tpxs are the second type of atypical 2-Cys Prxs with an intramolecular disulfide bond formed between the peroxidatic (CP, Cys61) and resolving (Cys95) cysteine residues. The extraordinarily long N-terminal chain of EcTpx folds into a β-hairpin making the overall structure very compact. Modeling suggests that, in atypical 2-Cys Prxs, the CR-loop as well as the CP-loop may alternately assume the fully folded or locally unfolded conformation depending on redox states, as does the CP-loop in typical 2-Cys Prxs. EcTpx exists as a dimer stabilized by hydrogen bonds. Its substrate binding site extends to the dimer interface. A modeled structure of the reduced EcTpx in complex with 15-hydroperoxyeicosatetraenoic acid suggests that the size and shape of the binding site are particularly suited for long fatty acid hydroperoxides consistent with its greater reactivity. Thioredoxin-dependent thiol peroxidase (Tpx) from Escherichia coli represents a group of antioxidant enzymes that are widely distributed in pathogenic bacterial species and which belong to the peroxiredoxin (Prx) family. Bacterial Tpxs are unique in that the location of the resolving cysteine (CR) is different from those of other Prxs. E. coli Tpx (EcTpx) shows substrate specificity toward alkyl hydroperoxides over H2O2 and is the most potent reductant of alkyl hydroperoxides surpassing AhpC and BCP, the other E. coli Prx members. Here, we present the crystal structure of EcTpx in the oxidized state determined at 2.2-Å resolution.

Prxs reduce deleterious H2O2 or alkyl hydroperoxides utilizing the thiol group of a cysteine residue (1.Chae H.Z. Robinson K. Poole L.B. Church G. Storz G. Rhee S.G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Nature. 2000; 407: 211-215Crossref PubMed Scopus (565) Google Scholar). Some Prxs also control cytokine-induced peroxide levels that mediate redox-sensitive signal transduction (2.Hofmann B.

Redox Rep. 2002; 7: 123-130Crossref PubMed Scopus (336) Google Scholar). All Prxs, belonging to the thioredoxin-fold superfamily, contain a conserved peroxidatic Cys (CP) in the N-terminal portion and share the same peroxidatic active site structure (7.Wood Z.A. Schröder E. Harris J.R. Poole L.B. Trends Biochem. Sci. 2003; 28: 32-40Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2114) Google Scholar). The CP residue is oxidized by peroxides to a cysteine sulfenic acid (CP-SOH) intermediate. Prxs are classified into either the 2-Cys or 1-Cys types, based on whether they contain the resolving Cys (CR) residue or not. In 2-Cys Prxs, the CP-SOH and CR-SH react and form a disulfide (CP-S-S-CR). The stable disulfide form is then reduced by one of several cell-specific disulfide oxidoreductases (e.g. thioredoxin (Trx), tryparedoxin, AhpD, or AhpF), completing the catalytic cycle (2.Hofmann B. Hecht H.J. Flohé L. Biol. Chem. 2002; 383: 347-364Crossref PubMed Scopus (772) Google Scholar, 7.Wood Z.A. Schröder E. Harris J.R. Poole L.B. Trends Biochem. Sci. 2003; 28: 32-40Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2114) Google Scholar). Unlike the 2-Cys Prxs, the catalytic mechanism of 1-Cys Prxs still remains to be elucidated (8.Choi H.J.

The 2-Cys Prxs have been further subdivided into either typical or atypical types depending on the location of the CR residue. In typical 2-Cys Prxs, the CP-SOH reacts with the CR residue located in the C-terminal arm from the other subunit of the antiparallel (α2) homodimer, resulting in two symmetrical active sites per dimer (10.Hirotsu S.

The remaining structures were determined in states that do not contain a disulfide. They include human PrxV (15.Declercq J.P. Evrard C. Clippe A. Stricht D.V. Bernard A. Knoops B. J. Mol. Biol. 2001; 311: 751-759Crossref PubMed Scopus (206) Google Scholar), Crithida fasciculate TryP (12.Alphey M.S. Bond C.S. Tetaud E. Fairlamb A.H. Hunter W.N. J. Mol.

Science. 2003; 300: 650-653Crossref PubMed Scopus (1139) Google Scholar), all in the reduced (CP-SH or Ser-OH in StAhpC) state, human PrxII (TPxB) (11.Schröder E. Littlechild J.A. Lebedev A.A. Errington N. Vagin A.A. Isupov M.N. Structure (Lond.). 2000; 8: 605-615Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (275) Google Scholar) in the overoxidized sulfinic acid (CP-SO2H) state, and human PrxVI (hORF6) (8.Choi H.J. Kang S.W. Yang C.H. Rhee S.G. Ryu S.E. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1998; 5: 400-406Crossref PubMed Scopus (332) Google Scholar) in the CP-SOH state. PrxV and PrxVI are atypical 2-Cys and 1-Cys Prxs, respectively, while the others (AhpC, PrxI, PrxII and TryP) are typical 2-Cys Prxs. Among these, only the structure of StAhpC has been determined in both the reduced and oxidized states (13.Wood Z.A. Poole L.B. Hantgan R.R. Karplus P.A. Biochemistry. 2002; 41: 5493-5504Crossref PubMed Scopus (297) Google Scholar, 16.Wood Z.A. Poole L.B. Karplus P.A. Science. 2003; 300: 650-653Crossref PubMed Scopus (1139) Google Scholar). Structural studies on Prxs, especially those of the typical 2-Cys type, have yielded valuable insights into their modes of action in detoxification or signaling. Crystal structures revealed that the five-residue segment containing the CP residue, referred to as the CP-loop, exists in two stable conformations depending on the redox states of Prxs (7.Wood Z.A. Schröder E. Harris J.R. Poole L.B. Trends Biochem. Sci. 2003; 28: 32-40Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2114) Google Scholar). The CP-loop adopts a fully folded (FF) conformation forming the first turn of a long α-helix in all non-disulfide forms, whereas it is locally unfolded (LU) from the α-helix in the disulfide forms. These structural data suggest that the following sequence of events occurs during a catalytic cycle of typical 2-Cys Prxs. First, the reduced Prx in an FF form reacts with the peroxide to become a CP-SOH intermediate still in FF. Then a local unfolding of the CP-loop and a concomitant conformational change of the long C-terminal arm of the other subunit occur for the CP-SOH and CR-SH to react and form a disulfide bond. Finally, the exposed disulfide in an LU form reacts with the reductant to regenerate the reduced Prx in an FF form. In the typical 2-Cys Prxs, the homodimers assemble into toroid-shaped ((α2)5) decamers when reduced or overoxidized, whereas the decamers dissociate into dimers when oxidized (11.Schröder E. Littlechild J.A. Lebedev A.A. Errington N. Vagin A.A. Isupov M.N. Structure (Lond.). 2000; 8: 605-615Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (275) Google Scholar, 13.Wood Z.A. Poole L.B. Hantgan R.R. Karplus P.A. Biochemistry. 2002; 41: 5493-5504Crossref PubMed Scopus (297) Google Scholar). Wood et al. (13.Wood Z.A. Poole L.B. Hantgan R.R. Karplus P.A. Biochemistry. 2002; 41: 5493-5504Crossref PubMed Scopus (297) Google Scholar) found that the CP-loop disrupts the interfacial interactions between adjacent dimers when it adopts the LU form, and suggested that the CP-loop acts as a molecular switch responsible for redox-dependent oligomerization. From structural data, they could also clarify the origin of different sensitivities to oxidative inactivation between the prokaryotic (much less sensitive) and eukaryotic 2-Cys Prxs. They identified two sequence motifs unique to the eukaryotic Prxs and suggested that these motifs act as a molecular switch that determines whether H2O2 acts as a deleterious oxidant or beneficial signal in eukaryotes (16.Wood Z.A. Poole L.B. Karplus P.A. Science. 2003; 300: 650-653Crossref PubMed Scopus (1139) Google Scholar). Contrary to the case of typical 2-Cys Prxs, structural data for the atypical 2-Cys Prxs are scarce and the structure of the reduced PrxV is the only one available at present. Escherichia coli has three Prx family members of peroxidases that are highly diverged from one another. They include the periplasmic thiol peroxidase (Tpx, p20, scavengase) (17.Cha M.K. Kim H.K. Kim I.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 28635-28641Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar, 18.Cha M.K. Kim H.K. Kim I.H. J. Bacteriol. 1996; 178: 5610-5614Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and a weakly active bacterioferritin-comigratory protein (BCP) (19.Jeong W. Cha M.K. Kim I.H. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 2924-2930Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (180) Google Scholar), and the alkyl hydroperoxide reductase peroxidase component (AhpC) (20.Costa Seaver L. Imlay J.A. J. Bacteriol. 2001; 183: 7173-7181Crossref PubMed Scopus (605) Google Scholar). Both Tpx and BCP specifically require Trx as a reductant, while AhpC requires AhpF. E. coli proteomics studies showed that, during the growth phase in minimal media and without induction by H2O2, Tpx (∼1.6 μm) is 3.5-fold less abundant than AhpC, and 2.5-fold more abundant than BCP (21.Link A.J. Robison K. Church G.M. Electrophoresis. 1997; 18: 1259-1313Crossref PubMed Scopus (303) Google Scholar). Homologues of E. coli Tpx (EcTpx) are widely distributed in both Gram-negative and Gram-positive eubacterial species, most of which are pathogenic (22.Wan X.Y. Zhou Y. Yan Z.Y. Wang H.L. Hou Y.D. Jin D.Y. FEBS Lett. 1997; 407: 32-36Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). EcTpx has three Cys residues (Cys61, Cys82, and Cys95), among which Cys61 was identified as the CP residue earlier (23.Zhou Y. Wan X.Y. Wang H.L. Yan Z.Y. Hou Y.D. Jin D.Y. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1997; 233: 848-852Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). Other Cys residues do not align with the CR residues of other 2-Cys Prxs. Very recently, Baker and Poole (24.Baker L.M.S. Poole L.B. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 9203-9211Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar) firmly established Cys95 as the CR residue. They confirmed the formation of an intramolecular disulfide bond, but did not explicitly describe Tpx as an atypical 2-Cys Prx probably because the location of the CR residue is quite different from that of archetypal PrxV. They found that EcTpx is homodimeric in solution independent of redox states although the dimerization is not required for catalytic reaction. They also found that EcTpx shows substrate specificity toward alkyl hydroperoxides over H2O2 and, on the basis of catalytic efficiency, is the most potent reductant of alkyl hydroperoxides surpassing AhpC and BCP. In this study, we have determined the crystal structure of EcTpx in its oxidized state, demonstrating that Tpx is a second type of atypical 2-Cys Prx. It is the first structural example that shows the intramolecular disulfide bond formed in a Prx. The structure also helps us to explain why EcTpx exists as a stable dimer and shows the substrate preference for alkyl hydroperoxides with greater catalytic efficiency. Crystallization and Data Collection—EcTpx was overexpressed, purified and crystallized as reported previously (25.Choi J. Choi S. Choi J. Cha M.K. Kim I.H. Shin W. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D. 2003; 59: 1064-1066Crossref PubMed Scopus (0) Google Scholar). Crystals were obtained at room temperature using the hanging-drop vapor-diffusion method. For the crystallization, 2 μl of reservoir solution (10% PEG4000, 20% 2-propyl alcohol, 50 mm Na-HEPES pH 7) and 2 μl of protein solution (10 mg/ml) were mixed and equilibrated against the reservoir. Rod-shaped small crystals appeared within 3 days. Seeding techniques with macroseeds were essential to obtain large single crystals. With this procedure, crystals grew routinely to their full size of 0.10 × 0.15 × 0.85 mm. The crystals belong to the orthorhombic space group P212121, with cell constants of a = 38.97, b = 58.97, and c = 127.59 Å. There are two molecules of EcTpx in the asymmetric unit. For phasing, three heavy atom derivatives were used. They were prepared by soaking the crystals for 7, 9, and 1 day, respectively, into solutions of mercury acetate, mercury chloride, and ethyl mercury chloride in which each heavy atom compound was dissolved in mother liquor at a final concentration of 3 mm. Both native and derivative crystals were flash-frozen at 100 K in a nitrogen stream before data collection, using 50% PEG4000 as a cryo-protectant. Data for native crystals were collected at λ = 1.12714 Å using a MacScience 2030 image plate detector at the beamline 6B of the Pohang Light Source, Korea. Data for derivative crystals were measured on a Rigaku rotating anode (CuKα = 1.5418 Å)-Raxis IV image plate system. Each data set was processed and scaled using the programs DENZO and SCALEPACK (26.Otwinowski Z. Minor W. Methods Enzymol. 1997; 276: 307-326Crossref PubMed Scopus (38526) Google Scholar). Structure Determination and Refinement—The structure of EcTpx was determined by the multiple isomorphous replacement with anomalous scattering (MIRAS) technique. Location of the heavy atom sites, refinement of heavy atom parameters and calculation of the initial phases were performed with the program SOLVE (27.Terwilliger T.C. Berendzen J. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D. 1999; 55: 849-861Crossref PubMed Scopus (3219) Google Scholar), including the anomalous scattering data in the resolution range of 30.0-3.0 Å. The initial MIRAS phases had a mean figure-of-merit of 0.60. Phases were improved with solvent flattening by using the program RESOLVE (28.Terwilliger T.C. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D. 2000; 56: 965-972Crossref PubMed Scopus (1633) Google Scholar). Model building was conducted using the program O (29.Jones T.A. Zou J.Y. Cowan S.W. Kjeldgaard M. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. A. 1991; 47: 110-119Crossref PubMed Scopus (13009) Google Scholar), based on a poly(A) model generated by the program RESOLVE. The model was refined with the program CNS (30.Brünger A.T. Adams P.D. Clore G.M. DeLano W.L. Gros P. Grosse-Kunstleve R.W. Jiang J.S. Kuszewski J. Nilges M. Pannu N.S. Read R.J. Rice L.M. Simonson T. Warren G.L. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D. 1998; 54: 905-921Crossref PubMed Scopus (16957) Google Scholar) progressively increasing the resolution to 2.2-Å. Five percent of the data were randomly selected to be set aside for the Rfree calculation. Water molecules were picked up from the difference map on the basis of the peak heights and distance criteria, and were discarded when thermal parameters after refinement were above 60 Å2. A summary of data collection, phasing and refinement statistics is shown in Table I. The stereochemical analysis using the program PROCHECK (31.Laskowski R.A. MacArthur M.W. Moss D.S. Thornton J.M. J. Appl. Crystallogr. 1993; 26: 283-291Crossref Google Scholar) showed that one residue is in generously allowed regions, and there is no residue in disallowed regions. Recent mass spectrometric analysis of EcTpx indicated the absence of the initiating methionine predicted by the tpx open reading frame (24.Baker L.M.S. Poole L.B. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 9203-9211Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar). In accordance with this data, there is clearly no electron density for this residue. The three C-terminal residues of Leu166, Lys167, and Ala168 are disordered in the molecules A and B. The final model contains residues 2-165 in each EcTpx molecule, and 353 water molecules. The R-value of the final model is 18.8% (Rfree = 24.6%) at 2.2-Å resolution. Structural figures were generated using the programs MOLSCRIPT (32.Kraulis P.J. J. Appl. Crystallogr. 1991; 24: 946-950Crossref Google Scholar) and RASTER3D (33.Merritt E.A. Murphy M.E.P. Acta Crystallogr. Sect.

The initial model was manually built from the crystal structure of oxidized EcTpx using the program O and employing the structure of reduced StAhpC as a template. The model was optimized by 50 ps solvated molecular dynamics (MD) simulations and energy minimization using the program AMBER (34.Case D.A. Pearlman D.A. Caldwell J.W. Cheatham III, T.E. Wang J. Ross W.S. Simmerling C.L. Darden T.A. Merz K.M. Stanton R.V. Cheng A. Vincent J.J. Crowley M. Tsui V. Gohlke H. Radmer R.J. Duan Y. Pitera J. Massova I. Seibel G.L. Singh U.C. Weiner P.K. Kollman P.A. AMBER 7. University of California, San Francisco2002Google Scholar). Atoms in the amino acid residues in the β-sheets 1-7 were frozen during the MD simulations, but energy minimization was performed without any constraints. Detailed protocols for MD simulations followed those previously reported (35.Cho S.W. Lee S. Shin W. J. Mol. Biol. 2001; 314: 863-878Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). The structures of oxidized PrxV and BCP were modeled in a similar way. A model for the reduced EcTpx-15-hydroperoxyeicosatetraenoic acid (15-HPETE) complex was constructed in the following manner. The structure of 15-HPETE in complex with a protein is not available yet. Thus the initial model of 15-HPETE was built based on the atomic coordinates of arachidonic acid in complex with adipocyte lipid-binding protein (PDB code, 1ADL). Then, 15-HPETE was manually docked into the putative binding site of reduced EcTpx adjusting its conformation. The initial complex model was extensively optimized as above. Overall Structure of Tpx—The crystal structure of EcTpx determined to 2.2-Å resolution (Fig. 1a) revealed that the enzyme is in the oxidized disulfide form, a stable intermediate in the catalytic cycle. EcTpx has a compact globular structure with a typical fold of the Prx family that is constructed around a seven-stranded twisted β-sheet surrounded by four α-helices (12.Alphey M.S. Bond C.S. Tetaud E. Fairlamb A.H. Hunter W.N. J. Mol. Biol. 2000; 300: 903-916Crossref PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar). When the CP residues are aligned, the N-terminal chain of EcTpx is longer by about 15 residues than those of other Prxs. This extra chain folds into a β-hairpin composed of two antiparallel β-strands that are designated βN1 and βN2, respectively. Other β strands are designated following those in other Prxs. The N-terminal β-hairpin is connected to the β1 by a 14 residue-long chain that is kinked at Gly22. The β2-strand is followed by a short segment of 310-helix, then two βαβ units (β3-α1-β4-α2-β5). A β-hairpin (β6 and β7), connected to β5 by the α3 and a long loop, completes the β-sheet and leads to the α4, then finally to a disordered C-terminal chain. The Prx family belongs to the Trx superfamily. A Trx fold in the EcTpx structure is defined by a five-stranded β-sheet (β5-β4-β3-β6-β7) that matches with β1-β3-β2-β4-β5 of Trx and by four flanking α-helices. The peroxidatic Cys61 of EcTpx is located on the Cp-loop before α1 and the resolving Cys95 is on a chain, designated the CR-loop, which connects the α2 and β5. The remaining Cys82 is located on the β4 and is quite distant (∼10 Å) from the active site. The two oxidized EcTpx molecules in the asymmetric unit have nearly identical structures with minor exceptions. The superposed Cα structures are shown in Fig. 1b. The corresponding Cα atoms are overlaid with an r.m.s. deviation of 0.64 Å. The largest conformational difference occurs at the N-terminal β-hairpin, with the Cα atoms of Gly9 on the β-turn being separated by 2.5 Å. This difference results from dissimilar contact environments in the crystal lattice. Unlike other Prxs, the α2-helix preceding the CR-loop is very short, not being clearly shaped in both molecules. The residues of Pro88-Gln91 and Gln91-Arg93 are defined as the α-helices in the molecules A and B, respectively, by the program DSSP (36.Kabsch W. Sander C. Biopolymers. 1983; 22: 2577-2637Crossref PubMed Scopus (12270) Google Scholar). The flanking CP- and CR-loops linked by the exposed cystine disulfide also show a significant, albeit small, conformational difference between the two molecules. The residues in these loop regions as well as the N-terminal chains have high B-factors, as shown by the color-coded Cα-Cα links in Fig. 1b. For the residues of Asp57-Leu67 and Leu87-Ile104 in the molecule A and of Asp57-Ala63 and Pro88-Val103 in the molecule B, the mean B-factors of their main chain atoms are larger than the overall mean B-factors of the respective molecules (see Table I). In particular, the cystine disulfides and several nearby residues have B-factors almost twice the mean value. The conformational difference between the two independent molecules and the high B-factors indicate that the CP- and CR-loops possess high mobility. Nevertheless, the electron density of these flexible regions is relatively well defined as shown in the σA-weighted 2Fo-Fc map (Fig. 1c). High mobility of chains linked by the disulfide bond was also observed in the structure of StAhpC (13.Wood Z.A. Poole L.B. Hantgan R.R. Karplus P.A. Biochemistry. 2002; 41: 5493-5504Crossref PubMed Scopus (297) Google Scholar). At present 47 bacterial Tpxs can be identified in the most recent sequence databases by BLAST searches.

https://openalex.org/W2147438402,"Activation of Raf-1 suppresses integrin activation, potentially through the activation of extracellular signal-regulated kinases 1 and 2 (ERK1/2). However, bulk ERK1/2 activation does not correlate with suppression. PEA-15 reverses suppression of integrin activation and binds ERK1/2. Here we report that PEA-15 reversal of integrin suppression depends on its capacity to bind ERK1/2, indicating that ERK1/2 function is indeed required for suppression. Mutations in either the death effector domain or C-terminal tail of PEA-15 that block ERK1/2 binding abrogated the reversal of integrin suppression. Furthermore, we used ERK/p38 chimeras and site-directed mutagenesis to identify ERK1/2 residues required for binding PEA-15. Mutations of residues that precede the αG helix and within the mitogen-activated protein kinase insert blocked ERK2 binding to PEA-15, but not activation of ERK2. These ERK2 mutants blocked the ability of PEA-15 to reverse suppression of integrin activation. Thus, PEA-15 regulation of integrin activation depends on its binding to ERK1/2. To directly test the role of ERK1/2 localization in suppression, we enforced membrane association of ERK1 and 2 by joining a membrane-targeting CAAX box sequence to them. Both ERK1-CAAX and ERK2-CAAX were membrane-localized and suppressed integrin activation. In contrast to suppression by membrane-targeted Raf-CAAX, suppression by ERK1/2-CAAX was not reversed by PEA-15. Thus, ERK1/2 are the Raf effectors for suppression of integrin activation, and PEA-15 reverses suppression by binding ERK1/2.

Changes in integrin affinity for ligand (activation) play a central role in integrin functions such as cell adhesion, migration and assembly of the extracellular matrix (1Schwartz M.A. Schaller M.D. Ginsberg M.H. Annu. Rev. Cell Dev. Biol. 1995; 11: 549-599Crossref PubMed Scopus (1460) Google Scholar). Activation is transduced by a complex series of cellular signaling pathways that modify the interaction of cytoplasmic proteins, such as talin (2Tadokoro S. Shattil S.J. Tai V. Liddington R.C. de Pereda J.M. Ginsberg M. Calderwood D.A. Science. 2003; 302: 103-106Crossref PubMed Scopus (961) Google Scholar), with integrin cytoplasmic domains (3Liddington R.C. Ginsberg M.H. J. Cell Biol. 2002; 158: 833-839Crossref PubMed Scopus (253) Google Scholar). Integrin activation is a tightly regulated event, suggesting the existence of pathways that can both promote and suppress integrin activation. One such pathway leads to a marked reduction in integrin affinity as a consequence of activation of the small GTP-binding protein H-Ras and its downstream effector kinase Raf-1 (4Hughes P.E.

Cell. 2002; 13: 2256-2265Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar) reduces integrin suppression, indicating that ERK1/2 are likely downstream effectors of H-Ras/Raf-1-mediated suppression. R-Ras, a small GTP-binding protein with substantial homology to H-Ras, has the opposite effect of H-Ras on the integrins (i.e. promoting integrin activation) (5Zhang Z. Vuori K. Wang H. Reed J.C. Ruoslahti E. Cell. 1996; 85: 61-69Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (377) Google Scholar). Thus, the interplay between R-Ras and H-Ras could act as a rheostat for integrin function. Certain chimeras of H-Ras/R-Ras proteins that retain the ability to suppress integrin activation were weak activators of ERK1/2 (6Hughes P.E. Oertli B. Hansen M. Chou F.L. Willumsen B.M. Ginsberg M.H. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2002; 13: 2256-2265Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). Moreover, inhibition of bulk ERK1/2 activation by use of a MEK inhibitor or transfection of MKP-3 does not abolish suppression (6Hughes P.E. Oertli B. Hansen M. Chou F.L. Willumsen B.M. Ginsberg M.H. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2002; 13: 2256-2265Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). These observations suggest that Ras-mediated integrin suppression may be independent of ERK1/2 or that low level ERK1/2 activation in particular cellular areas is sufficient for suppression.Interest in further characterizing the intracellular signaling pathways that regulate integrin activation led to the isolation of a small protein, previously designated PEA-15 (7Araujo H. Danziger N. Cordier J. Glowinski J. Chneiweiss H. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 5911-5920Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 8Ramos J.W. Kojima T.K. Hughes P.E. Fenczik C.A. Ginsberg M.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 33897-33900Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). Cellular expression of PEA-15, a 15-kDa protein expressed in a broad range of tissues and enriched in astrocytes (9Danziger N. Yokoyama M. Jay T. Cordier J. Glowinski J. Chneiweiss H. J. Neurochem. 1995; 64: 1016-1025Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar), prevents activated H-Ras/Raf-1-mediated integrin suppression (8Ramos J.W. Kojima T.K. Hughes P.E. Fenczik C.A. Ginsberg M.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 33897-33900Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). PEA-15 binds ERK1/2 but does not inhibit ERK1/2 kinase activity or activation; instead, PEA-15 redirects the output of ERK1/2 signaling by altering the subcellular localization of ERK1/2 (10Formstecher E. Ramos J.W. Fauquet M. Calderwood D.A. Hsieh J.-C. Canton B. Nguyen X.-T. Barnier J.-V. Camonis J. Ginsberg M.H. Chneiweiss H. Dev. Cell. 2001; 1: 1-20Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (252) Google Scholar). Thus, it is plausible that PEA-15 may be one of a class of proteins capable of modulating ERK1/2 function and thereby integrin suppression. PEA-15 is composed of an N-terminal death effector domain (DED), a protein interaction module more commonly found in proteins that regulate apoptosis, and a C-terminal tail of irregular structure. NMR “footprinting” and mutagenesis studies identified residues in both the DED and tail that are required for ERK1/2 binding (11Hill J.M. Vaidyanathan H. Ramos J.W. Ginsberg M.H. Werner M.H. EMBO J. 2002; 21: 6494-6504Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). In this study, we explored the relationship between PEA-15 interaction with ERK1/2 and the role of ERK1/2 in integrin suppression. Single point mutations in either the DED or tail of PEA-15, which inhibit interaction with ERK1/2, resulted in a concomitant loss of the ability of PEA-15 to reverse suppression of integrin activation. Furthermore, we used a series of ERK/p38 chimeras (12Brunet A. Pouyssegur J. Science. 1996; 272: 1652-1655Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar, 13Wilsbacher J.L. Goldsmith E.J. Cobb M.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 16988-16994Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar) in combination with site-directed mutagenesis to identify ERK1/2 residues required for PEA-15 binding. Point mutation of residues preceding the αG helix or within the MAPK insert blocked the capacity of ERK2 to bind PEA-15 but did not adversely effect ERK2 phosphorylation. Cellular expression of each of these mutant ERKs blocked the ability of PEA-15 to reverse suppression of integrin activation. Thus, the capacity of PEA-15 to regulate integrin activation depends on its binding to ERK1/2. To directly test the role of ERK1/2 in suppression, we enforced membrane association of ERK1 and 2 by joining a membrane-targeting CAAX box sequence to them. Both ERK1-CAAX and ERK2-CAAX were membrane-localized and suppressed integrin activation. In contrast to suppression by membrane-targeted Raf-CAAX, suppression by ERK1/2-CAAX was not reversed by PEA-15. Thus, ERK1/2 are the Raf effectors that lead to suppression of integrin activation, and PEA-15 reverses suppression by binding ERK1/2.MATERIALS AND METHODSCell Culture—Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (Invitrogen) supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum (Invitrogen), 1% nonessential amino acids (Sigma), 1% glutamine (Sigma), and 1% penicillin and streptomycin (Sigma).Antibodies, Reagents, and cDNA Constructs—The activating β1 antibody 9EG7 was purchased from Pharmingen. The anti-ERK1 and anti-ERK2, anti-Ras, anti-RhoGDi, and anti-phospho-ERK1/2 antibodies were purchased from Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc.

Kinase-dead HA-ERK1(K71R)-CAAX-pEF was generated by using the QuikChange™ kit (Stratagene) using HA-ERK1-CAAX-pEF as template. GST-PEA-15 expression vector was constructed by subcloning the full-length PEA-15 from HA--PEA-15-pcDNA3 into the pGEX-2T vector (Amersham Biosciences). Purification of recombinant 3Fn-(9–11) from the pGEX expression vector encoding Type III repeats 9–11 of fibronectin was previously described (16Ramos J.W. DeSimone D.W. J.

Total lysates were homogenized with binding buffer (20 mm HEPES, pH 7.2, 1% Nonidet P-40, 10% glycerol, 2 mm EGTA, 2 mm MgCl2) and centrifuged at 12,000 rpm for 10 min. The cleared lysates (supernatant) were mixed with 10 μl of GSH-Sepharose-bound GST-PEA-15 for 2 h at 4 °C. After washing four times with binding buffer, bound proteins were eluted with SDS sample buffer and resolved by SDS-PAGE under reducing conditions. Bound proteins were visualized by Western blotting with anti-HA to detect transfected chimeric proteins. The same protocol was used for GST-PEA-15 pull-down of HA-ERK1-CAAX, HA-ERK1-SAAX, and HA-ERK1(K71R)-CAAX.Wild-type and mutant ERK2 contained in a NpT7–5 vector (17Zhang F. Robbins D.J. Cobb M.H.

GST-PEA-15 bound to glutathione-agarose beads (Sigma) was incubated with 35S-labeled wild-type and mutant ERK2 proteins in 150 μl of 50 mm HEPES (pH 7.4), 50 mm NaCl, 5 mm EDTA, 1% Nonidet P-40, and 10% glycerol. Samples were incubated for 2 h at 4 °C and then washed three times with 0.5 ml of the same buffer. The bound proteins were separated on 16% Tris-Tricine gels and visualized by phosphorimaging.Flow Cytometry—Analytical two-color flow cytometry was carried out as previously described (4Hughes P.E. Renshaw M.W. Pfaff M. Forsyth J. Keivens V.M. Schwartz M.A. Ginsberg M.H. Cell. 1997; 88: 521-530Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (434) Google Scholar). Briefly, CHO cells were transfected with GFP (0.1 μg) as transfection marker and a combination of HA-ERK2-pcDNA3, ERK2 mutants in the pcDNA3 vector, H-Ras(G12V)-pcDNA3, and HA-PEA-15-pcDNA3. A total of 5 μg of DNA was used for each transfection. Transient transfections were carried out using Lipo-fectAMINE Plus reagent as per the manufacturer's protocol (Invitrogen). 24 h post-transfection, cells were harvested and analyzed for transfection efficiency (GFP) and integrin binding to 3Fn-(9–11). In brief, for each transfection, harvested cells were divided into three tubes. The three preparations were used to assay for binding to 3Fn-(9–11) alone, binding in the presence of EDTA (10 mm), or in the presence of 9EG7 (10 ng/μl). All incubation and washes were carried out using 1× Tyrode buffer (10 mm HEPES, 10 g of NaCl, 1.015 g of NaHCO3, 0.195 g of KCl, 1 mg/ml dextrose, 1 mg/ml bovine serum albumin, 1 mm CaCl2, 1 mm MgCl2, pH 7.4). Cells were first incubated with EDTA or 9EG7 for 10 min at room temperature, and 3Fn-(9–11) was then added to all samples and allowed to incubate at room temperature for 20 min. After washing twice with 1× Tyrode buffer, cells were incubated with streptavidin-R-phycoerythrin (20 ng/μl) on ice for 20 min. Propidium iodide (1 ng/μl) was added to each sample for the last 5 min. Samples were washed twice before analysis. Integrin activation was quantified as an activation index (AI) as previously defined (4Hughes P.E. Renshaw M.W. Pfaff M. Forsyth J. Keivens V.M. Schwartz M.A. Ginsberg M.H. Cell. 1997; 88: 521-530Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (434) Google Scholar). AI = 100 * (F – Fo)/(Fm – Fo), where F represents the geometric mean fluorescence (GMF) of 3Fn-(9–11) binding alone, Fo is the GMF of 3Fn-(9–11) binding in the presence of EDTA(10 mm), and Fm is the GMF of 3Fn-(9–11) binding in the presence of 9EG7. The percentage of suppression was calculated as 100 * (AIM – AIT)/AIM, where AIM is the activation index of the mock-transfected cells, and AIT is the activation index in the presence of a transfected cDNA. The percentage of reversal of suppression was calculated as 100 * (AI – AIR)/AI, in which AI is the activation index of the control cells, and AIR is the activation index in the presence of a transfected rescuing cDNA. In addition to FACS analysis, the cell lysate of each transfection was analyzed for expression of the transfected constructs and phosphorylation of ERK1/2 by immunoblotting. The same protocol was used to assay integrin suppression by Raf-CAAX, HA-ERK1-CAAX, HA-ERK1-SAAX, and HA-ERK1(K71R)-CAAX.PEA-15 Knockout Fibroblasts—PEA-15 knockout fibroblasts derived from PEA-15 null mice (18Kitsberg D.

As a control, knockout and wild-type fibroblasts were transiently transfected with GFP and empty pcDNA3 vector. Transient transfections were carried out using LipofectAMINE and Plus reagents per the manufacturer's protocol (Invitrogen). 24 h posttransfection, cells were incubated in 0.5% serum Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium overnight. After stimulation with 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate (TPA) (100 nm) for 1 h, cells were harvested and analyzed for transfection efficiency (GFP) and integrin binding to 3Fn-(9–11) by two-color flow cytometry as described above. Additionally, cell lysates were analyzed for expression of transfected HA-PEA-15 and phosphorylation of ERK1/2 induced by TPA treatment.Subcellular Fractionation—CHO cells were transfected as described above with HA-ERK1-CAAX, HA-ERK1-SAAX, or HA-ERK1(K71R)-CAAX. 24 h post-transfection, cells were harvested in 0.5 ml of lysis buffer (20 mm HEPES-KOH, pH 7.5, 1.5 mm MgCl2, 5 mm KCl, 0.2 mm NaVO4, 10 μg/ml leupeptin, 10 μg/ml aprotinin, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride). After a 10-min incubation on ice to allow for swelling, cells were disrupted using 40 strokes in a Dounce homogenizer. A fraction of the total cell lysate was saved prior to centrifugation at 2000 rpm for 10 min to pellet the nuclei. The supernatant was subjected to additional centrifugation at 13,000 rpm for 30 min to pellet the membrane fraction. The resultant supernatant is the cytosolic fraction. The membrane pellet was extracted at 4 °C with lysis buffer containing 1% Nonidet P-40. After centrifuging at 14,000 rpm for 10 min, the membrane-soluble supernatant was removed, and the insoluble pellet was resuspended in 100 μl of 1× SDS-PAGE buffer. Total lysate, membrane-soluble, and cytosolic fractions were analyzed for protein expression by immunoblot.RESULTSMutations of PEA-15 That Block ERK1/2 Binding Abrogate Reversal of H-Ras/Raf-1-dependent Integrin Suppression— PEA-15 binds ERK1/2 and blocks the ability of activated H-Ras to suppress activation of recombinant chimeric integrins. To determine whether PEA-15 affects the activation of native integrins, we assessed the effects of PEA-15 on activation of integrins. Both wild type and PEA-15 knockout fibroblasts bound to the recombinant cell-binding domain of fibronectin (3Fn-(9–11); Fig. 1A) to a similar extent. In contrast, when we stimulated integrin activation with TPA, wild type fibroblasts showed an increase in specific 3Fn-(9–11) binding (Fig. 1A), but the PEA-15 knockout cells (Fig. 1A) did not alter 3Fn-(9–11) binding. The TPA was active in both cell contexts, since it activated ERK MAPK (Fig. 1B). These data suggested the possibility that the absence of PEA-15 rendered the integrins resistant to activation, possibly because TPA also activated the ERK pathway leading to concomitant suppression. To test this possibility, we reconstituted the knockout cells with PEA-15, leading to restoration of TPA activation of 3Fn-(9–11) binding. In contrast, transfection of wild type cells with PEA-15 had no additional effect on responsiveness to TPA (Fig. 1A). Comparable expression of transfected HA-PEA-15 was observed (Fig. 1B) in both cell types. Thus, endogenous PEA-15 can regulate the response of cellular integrins to agonists.The foregoing experiment showed that PEA-15 can promote cellular activation of integrins by agonists that activate the ERK MAPK pathway. To directly test this idea, we utilized the CHO cell system that has been extensively employed to analyze integrin activation (4Hughes P.E. Renshaw M.W. Pfaff M. Forsyth J. Keivens V.M.

In these cells, 3Fn-(9–11) binds to endogenous integrin α5β1, and that binding can be suppressed by transfection with activated H-Ras or Raf mutants (6Hughes P.E. Oertli B. Hansen M. Chou F.L.

Co-transfection with PEA-15 prevented activated H-Ras(G12V) suppression of 3Fn-(9–11) binding (data not shown, but see Fig. 2B). Thus, PEA-15 can promote the activation of endogenous integrin α5β1 and can prevent suppression by activated H-Ras.Fig. 2PEA-15 reversal of H-Ras(G12V) suppression requires residues implicated in ERK1/2 binding.A, ribbon representation of the three-dimensional structure of PEA-15 (10Formstecher E.

B, summary of FACS analysis of the effect of point mutations on the ability of PEA-15 to rescue H-Ras-induced suppression. To measure reversal of suppression, various PEA-15 mutants were transfected with wild-type ERK2 and H-Ras(G12V). Percentage reversal is calculated as described under “Materials and Methods.” Mutations of PEA-15 that block ERK1/2 binding (I121R, L123R, and K129E) abolish reversal. In contrast, mutants that partially inhibit ERK1/2 binding either partially reduce (K122E) or fail to reduce (E18R) reversal. C, each of the transfected cells from B were lysed in SDS sample buffer and fractionated by SDS-PAGE, and the expression of wild-type or mutant PEA-15 was assessed by immunoblotting. Blotting with anti-phospho-ERK1/2 is shown in the lower panel. Note that neither wild type nor mutant PEA-15 reduces the extent of ERK1/2 phosphorylation induced by H-Ras(G12V).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)To explore the role of the PEA-15 interaction with ERK1/2 in modulating integrin activation, we exploited the recently determined structure of PEA-15 (11Hill J.M. Vaidyanathan H. Ramos J.W. Ginsberg M.H. Werner M.H. EMBO J. 2002; 21: 6494-6504Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). PEA-15 consists of an N-terminal DED composed of six antiparallel amphipathic α-helices closely packed around a central hydrophobic core, followed by a long C-terminal tail (Fig. 2A). The C-terminal tail is irregularly structured with the exception of residues 120–123, which form a single turn of 310-helix. NMR “footprinting” and site-directed mutagenesis have established that residues in both the DED and the tail are involved in ERK1/2 binding (10Formstecher E. Ramos J.W. Fauquet M. Calderwood D.A.

Vaidyanathan H. Ramos J.W. Ginsberg M.H. Werner M.H. EMBO J. 2002; 21: 6494-6504Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). In particular, one mutation in the DED (D74A) and three mutations in the tail (I121R, L123R, and K129E) strongly inhibit binding to ERK1/2. The D74A mutant has previously been shown to block the effects of PEA-15 on integrin activation (8Ramos J.W. Kojima T.K. Hughes P.E. Fenczik C.A. Ginsberg M.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 33897-33900Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). Similarly, each of the three new mutants that block ERK1/2 binding also abrogated the effects of PEA-15 on integrin activation (Fig. 2B). Mutations within PEA-15 that were only partially defective for ERK1/2 binding (11Hill J.M. Vaidyanathan H. Ramos J.W. Ginsberg M.H. Werner M.H. EMBO J. 2002; 21: 6494-6504Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar) either partially (K122E) or fully (E18R) reversed integrin suppression, which correlates with the relative defect in PEA-15/ERK2 interaction (11Hill J.M. Vaidyanathan H. Ramos J.W. Ginsberg M.H. Werner M.H. EMBO J. 2002; 21: 6494-6504Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar) (Fig. 2B). These observations were not a consequence of differential expression levels of the mutants (Fig. 2C). Furthermore, ERK1/2 was phosphorylated when each of the mutants was co-transfected with H-Ras(G12V) (Fig. 2C). Thus, the capacity of PEA-15 to bind to ERK1/2 closely correlates with its ability to reverse H-Ras suppression of integrin activation.Identification of ERK1/2 Mutants That Fail to Bind PEA-15—The foregoing experiments showed that PEA-15 mutations that strongly inhibit ERK1/2 binding also abrogated the capacity of PEA-15 to block suppression of integrin activation. However, these mutations may perturb other functions of PEA-15 in addition to ERK1/2 binding. To exclude this possibility, we sought to identify mutations in ERK1/2 that disrupt PEA-15 binding and to learn whether they block the effect of PEA-15 on integrin activation. PEA-15 binds specifically to ERK1/2 and not to the related MAPKs p38 or c-Jun N-terminal kinase (10Formstecher E. Ramos J.W. Fauquet M. Calderwood D.A. Hsieh J.-C. Canton B. Nguyen X.-T. Barnier J.-V. Camonis J. Ginsberg M.H. Chneiweiss H. Dev. Cell. 2001; 1: 1-20Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (252) Google Scholar). Furthermore, there is a high degree of sequence identity between ERK1 and ERK2. To map the regions of ERK1/2 involved in PEA-15 binding, we employed a number of existing ERK/p38 chimeras (Fig. 3A) used previously to identify domains important for interacting with upstream kinases, target substrates, and phosphatases (12Brunet A. Pouyssegur J. Science. 1996; 272: 1652-1655Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar, 13Wilsbacher J.L. Goldsmith E.J. Cobb M.H. J. Biol.

A. 1997; 94: 2327-2332Crossref PubMed Scopus (244) Google Scholar), and the chimeras contain selected intact structural subdomains from each enzyme. Binding to PEA-15 was assessed using lysates from CHO cells transfected with HA-tagged ERK/p38 chimeras incubated with immobilized GST-PEA-15 (Fig. 3, B and C). A chimera possessing the first four subdomains and the C-terminal loop of p38, which form the N-terminal half of the protein, retained the ability to bind PEA-15 (chimera PIVECTP in Fig. 3B). In contrast, studies of C-terminal chimeras of ERK1 and p38 indicated that only a chimera containing subdomains X and XI of ERK1 (chimera EXIP in Fig. 3C) retained binding activity. Conversely, insertion of subdomains X and XI of p38 into ERK1 abolished binding (chimera EV"

In contrast to many reports that verify the importance of cholesterol among raft lipid components, studies that address the role of sphingolipids in raft organization and function are scarce. Here, we investigate the role of glycosphingolipids (GSLs) in raft structure and raft-mediated signal transduction in T lymphocytes by the usage of a specific GSL synthesis inhibitor, d-threo-1-phenyl-2-decanoylamino-3-morpholino-1-propanol (d-PDMP). Surface GM1 expression and the expression of GSLs in rafts were profoundly reduced by d-PDMP treatment, whereas the expression of other lipid and protein constituents, such as cholesterol, sphingomyelin, Lck, and linker for activation of T cells, was not affected. T cell receptor-mediated signal transduction induced by antigen stimulation or by antibody cross-linking was normal in d-PDMP-treated T cells. In contrast, the signal through glycosylphosphatidylinositol (GPI)-anchored proteins was clearly augmented by d-PDMP treatment. Moreover, GPI-anchored proteins became more susceptible to phosphatidylinositol-specific phospholipase C cleavage in d-PDMP-treated cells, demonstrating that GSL depletion from rafts primarily influences the expression state and function of GPI-anchored proteins. Finally, by comparing the effect of d-PDMP with that of methyl-β-cyclodextrin, we identified that compared with cholesterol depletion, GSL depletion has the opposite effect on the phosphatidylinositol-specific phospholipase C sensitivity and signaling ability of GPI-anchored proteins. These results indicate a specific role of GSLs in T cell membrane rafts that is dispensable for T cell receptor signaling but is important for the signal via GPI-anchored proteins.

Recently, it was discovered that within the plasma membrane exist microdomains known as lipid rafts, which play important roles in various cellular functions including membrane trafficking, signal transduction, and endocytosis (1Simons K.

Moreover, many raft-associated proteins like Src-family kinases and linker for activation of T cells (LAT) are indispensable for lymphocyte signal transduction, indicating the importance of rafts as signaling platforms on the plasma membrane. In addition to physiological functions of rafts in many cellular processes, it has become apparent that several groups of pathogens preferentially utilize rafts when interacting with their target cells (7van der Goot F.G. Harder T. Semin. Immunol. 2001; 13: 89-97Crossref PubMed Scopus (221) Google Scholar, 8Simons K. Ehehalt R. J. Clin. Invest. 2002; 110: 597-603Crossref PubMed Scopus (898) Google Scholar).

Lipid rafts are highly enriched in cholesterol and sphingolipids (glycosphingolipids (GSLs) and sphingomyelin (SM)) (1Simons K. Toomre D. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 1: 31-39Crossref PubMed Scopus (5058) Google Scholar, 2Brown D.A. London E. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 17221-17224Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2035) Google Scholar). Among these lipid components, cholesterol has a critical function for maintaining raft structure. Cholesterol is thought to fill the space between the hydrocarbon chains of the sphingolipids and to function as glue that keeps the raft assembly together. In fact, cholesterol depletion from cell membranes using drugs, such as methyl-β-cyclodextrin (MβCD), generally results in disruption of raft-mediated cellular functions (1Simons K. Toomre D. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 1: 31-39Crossref PubMed Scopus (5058) Google Scholar). Thus, despite some concerns regarding side effects of the drug on signaling events (9Pizzo P. Giurisato E. Tassi M. Benedetti A. Pozzan T. Viola A. Eur. J. Immunol. 2002; 32: 3082-3091Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar), this experimental approach has been widely used to verify the importance of cholesterol in raft organization and function. In contrast to many studies manipulating the cholesterol level in lipid rafts, reports that address a role for sphingolipids in raft function are scarce. A previous study (10Fukasawa M. Nishijima M. Itabe H. Takano T. Hanada K. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 34028-34034Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar) demonstrates that reduction of SM levels in Chinese hamster ovary mutant cells induced decreased distribution of cholesterol in lipid rafts. Moreover, it was reported that the addition of exogenous gangliosides to the culture of Madin-Darby canine kidney cells or Chinese hamster ovary-K1 cells displaced glycosylphosphatidylinositol (GPI)-anchored proteins from lipid microdomains (11Simons M. Friedrichson T. Schulz J.B. Pitto M. Masserini M. Kurzchalia T.V. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1999; 10: 3187-3196Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar, 12Crespo P.M. Zurita A.R. Daniotti J.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 44731-44739Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). All of these studies suggested that changes in sphingolipid contents alter raft lipid and protein constituents. However, none of these studies contributed to our understanding of any functional change in membrane rafts by the manipulation of sphingolipid levels. Although an effect of GSL deficiency on functional raft formation has been suggested previously (13Inokuchi J.I. Uemura S. Kabayama K. Igarashi Y. Glycoconj. J. 2000; 17: 239-245Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar), whether sphingolipids are essential for raft-mediated signal transduction remains to be addressed. In this study, we investigated a role for sphingolipids in raft organization and function in lymphocytes, focusing particularly on a role for GSLs by the usage of a specific GSL synthesis inhibitor, d-PDMP. We demonstrated that the expression state of GPI-anchored proteins is affected by the reduction of GSL levels. Furthermore, our results showed that a reduced level of GSLs in membrane rafts modulates signaling through GPI-anchored proteins but not through the TCR. By comparing the effect of d-PDMP with that of MβCD, we also identified that GSL and cholesterol depletion have distinctly different influences on GPI-anchored proteins in lipid rafts.

All of the cell lines were maintained in RPMI 1640 medium supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum, 50 μm 2-mercaptoethanol, penicillin (100 units/ml), and streptomycin (100 μg/ml) at 37 °C in a humidified atmosphere of 5% CO2. DNA Construction and Retroviral-mediated Gene Transfer—A DNA fragment coding for the full-length mouse Thy-1 was obtained by reverse transcriptase-PCR using the 2B4 T cell hybridoma cDNA as a template. The sense and the antisense primers contained restriction sites for XhoI and for NotI, respectively. The fragment was subcloned into pPCR-Script (Stratagene) and sequenced. The XhoI/NotI fragment was then cloned into the pMX-puromycin retroviral vector (17Onishi M. Nosaka T. Misawa K. Mui A.L. Gorman D. McMahon M. Miyajima A. Kitamura T. Mol. Cell.

FITC-conjugated avidin and FITC-conjugated cholera toxin B were purchased from BD Biosciences and Sigma, respectively. Antigen pigeon cytochrome c (amino acids 88–104) was synthesized according to the amino acid sequence as described previously (22Hansburg D. Fairwell T. Schwartz R.H. Appella E. J.

For MβCD pretreatment, cells were incubated with 4 mm MβCD (Sigma) in serum-free RPMI 1640 medium for 40 min at 37 °C. PDMP- or MβCD-treated cells were washed with RPMI 1640 medium and then used for all of the experiments. Isolation of Raft Fraction and Immunoblotting Analysis—Raft fractions were prepared as described previously (23Kosugi A. Sakakura J. Yasuda K. Ogata M. Hamaoka T. Immunity. 2001; 14: 669-680Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). 1×108 cells were washed in PBS containing 5 mm sodium orthovanadate and 5 mm EDTA and then were lysed with 1 mm MES-buffered saline (25 mm MES, pH 6.5, and 150 mm NaCl) containing 1% Triton X-100, 10 μg/ml aprotinin, 10 μg/ml leupeptin, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 5 mm sodium orthovanadate, and 5 mm EDTA. The lysate was homogenized with 20 strokes of a Dounce homogenizer, gently mixed with an equal volume of 80% sucrose (w/v) in MES-buffered saline, and placed at the bottom of a14 × 95-mm clear centrifuge tube (catalog number 344060, Beckman). The sample was then overlaid with 6.5 ml of 30% sucrose and 3.5 ml of 5% sucrose in MES-buffered saline and centrifuged at 200,000 × g using a Beckman SW 40Ti rotor at 4 °C for 16 h. Following centrifugation, 12 1-ml fractions (excluding the pellet) were collected from the top of the gradient. Aliquots corresponding to fractions 4 and 5 were combined as raft fractions, and those corresponding to fractions 11 and 12 were combined as non-raft fractions. Immunoblotting analysis was performed as described previously (23Kosugi A. Sakakura J. Yasuda K. Ogata M. Hamaoka T. Immunity. 2001; 14: 669-680Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). Intracellular Calcium Analysis—PDMP- or MβCD-treated cells were incubated with 3 μm Indo-1 AM (Molecular Probes) for 30 min at 37 °C in Hanks'-buffered saline solution containing 1% fetal calf serum, 1 mm CaCl2, and 1 mm MgCl2. Intracellular calcium analysis was performed on a BD LSR (BD Biosciences). Indo-1 was excited by a He-Cd laser (325 nm, 8 milliwatts). Indo-1 emission was detected using a 380-nm (violet) low pass filter and a 510/20-nm (blue) bandpass filter. To determine the relative intracellular calcium concentration, Indo-1-loaded cells were warmed to 37 °C, analyzed for 15–30 s to establish base-line calcium levels, and stimulated by the addition of OKT3 (10 μg/ml) or G7 (10 μg/ml). Acquisition was continued in real time up to 200 or 512 s. IL-2 Production—PDMP-treated 2B4 cells (1×105) were stimulated by incubation with immobilized 2C11 mAb (1 μg/ml), soluble G7 mAb (10 μg/ml), or graded concentrations of antigen pigeon cytochrome c for 24 h. LK35.2 cells (5×104) were added as a source of APC. Supernatants of the culture were assayed for IL-2 production by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (BD Biosciences). Cholesterol Staining—To analyze cholesterol expression on the cell surface, biotinylated Cθ derived from perfringolysin O (θ-toxin) was used as described previously (24Waheed A.A. Shimada Y.

PDMP- or MβCD-treated cells were incubated with biotinylated Cθ (50 μg/ml) in PBS containing 1 mg/ml bovine serum albumin at room temperature for 20 min. After washing twice with PBS, the cells were stained with FITC-conjugated avidin and analyzed by flow cytometry. Confocal Microscopy—Confocal microscopy was performed with a 63/1.4 oil-objective lens on a Zeiss LSM 510 confocal microscope using laser excitation at 488 and 543 nm. The widths of GFP and Texas Red emission channels were set such that bleed-through across channels was negligible. Lipid Analysis—Lipid analysis of the raft fractions was performed as described previously (13Inokuchi J.I. Uemura S. Kabayama K. Igarashi Y. Glycoconj. J. 2000; 17: 239-245Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). The chloroform-rich phase from Folch partition was separated into neutral and acidic lipid fractions by using a DEAE-Sephadex A-25 column (acetate form, 2.4-ml bed volume; Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). The fractions were dried and subjected to methanolic 0.1 m NaOH for ester cleavage. After neutralization, solutions were desalted with Sep-Pak C18 reverse-phase cartridges (Waters Associates) and lipids were eluted. Acidic lipids were separated by silica gel high performance thin layer chromatography (HPTLC) plates (Merck) with chroloform/methanol/0.5% CaCl2 (55:45:10) and detected with orcinol-sulfuric acid reagent. Neutral lipids were separated by HPTLC half-developed with chloroform/methanol/water (65:25:4), dried, redeveloped with hexane:diethyl ether:acetic acid (50:50:1), and detected with 3% cupric acetate, 8% phosphoric acid reagent. PI-PLC treatment—Jurkat cells or J.EcoR-derived transfectants (107/ml) were treated with various concentrations of bacterial phosphatidylinositol (PI)-specific PLC (Sigma) in Ca2+- and Mg2+-free PBS for 60 min at 37 °C. The cells were washed twice in PBS with 2% fetal calf serum and stained with FITC-conjugated anti-Thy1.2 mAb or biotin-conjugated anti-CD59 mAb followed by FITC-conjugated avidin. Reduction in Surface Expression of GSL by an Inhibitor of Glucosylceramide Synthase, d-PDMP—To elucidate a role of GSLs in membrane raft organization and function in T cells, we depleted cellular GSLs by using an inhibitor of glucosylceramide (GlcCer) synthase, d-PDMP (25Inokuchi J. Radin N.S. J. Lipid Res. 1987; 28: 565-571Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). It has been reported that an analog of ceramide, d-PDMP, could inhibit UDP-glucose:N-acylsphingosine glucosyltransferase, which forms GlcCer from ceramide, the first step of synthesis of a series of GSLs (Fig. 1A). d-PDMP has been used to study biological functions in living cells (26De Maria R. Lenti L. Malisan F. d'Agostino F. Tomassini B. Zeuner A. Rippo M.R. Testi R. Science. 1997; 277: 1652-1655Crossref PubMed Scopus (373) Google Scholar). When we added d-PDMP to the culture of Jurkat cells at a concentration of 10 μm, surface GM1 expression was reduced in a time-dependent manner (Fig. 1B). Surface GM1 expression in Jurkat cells was considerably reduced even 1 day after the addition of d-PDMP, and 3 days after the addition the level of surface GM1 was almost one-tenth of that observed in cells without treatment. Because d-PDMP treatment more than 3 days did not induce a further inhibition of GM1 expression, we treated lymphoid cell lines with d-PDMP for 3 days in this study. With regard to the concentration of d-PDMP, we were able to inhibit GM1 expression in Jurkat cells at a concentration of 10 μm without detriment to cell viability and cell growth (data not shown). As a control for d-PDMP, we used l-PDMP, the stereoisomer of d-PDMP, which has been shown to be inactive in inhibiting GlcCer synthase (27Inokuchi J. Momosaki K. Shimeno H. Nagamatsu A. Radin N.S. J. Cell. Physiol. 1989; 141: 573-583Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). As previously reported, we did not observe any reduction in GM1 expression by l-PDMP treatment (Fig. 1C). Lipid Raft Organization in d-PDMP-treated Jurkat Cells—We examined whether membrane raft structure was affected by the reduction in cellular GSL levels by d-PDMP. Lipid and protein components in membrane rafts are known to be fractionated into a Triton X-100-insoluble floating, so-called raft or detergent-resistant membrane fraction by sucrose density gradient centrifugation. We prepared raft fractions from untreated, d-PDMP-treated, and l-PDMP-treated Jurkat cells and first analyzed raft-associated lipids by HPTLC using acidic and neutral lipid fractions. We observed that major GSLs expressed in Jurkat cells were GM3 and GM2 and that these GSLs were mostly lost upon d-PDMP but not by l-PDMP treatment (Fig. 2A, top). When we analyzed the neutral lipid fractions, we were able to detect the expression of GlcCer, ceramide, SM, and cholesterol from untreated and l-PDMP-treated cells. However, the expression of GlcCer was almost completely inhibited in d-PDMP-treated cells (Fig. 2A, bottom). It is noteworthy that levels of SM and cholesterol were not changed by the inhibition of GSL synthesis. Normal expression of cholesterol in membrane rafts from d-PDMP-treated cells was also verified by the binding of θ-toxin on the cell surface in flow cytometry and confocal microscopy analysis (Figs. 2B and 3). Perfringolysin O, a cholesterol-binding toxin produced by Clostridium perfringens, is shown to bind selectively to cholesterol-rich microdomains of intact cells (24Waheed A.A. Shimada Y. Heijnen H.F. Nakamura M. Inomata M. Hayashi M. Iwashita S. Slot J.W. Ohno-Iwashita Y. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 4926-4931Crossref PubMed Scopus (197) Google Scholar). Indeed, the distribution of this toxin showed a patchlike pattern on the cell surface, and LAT-GFP, one of raft markers we have previously reported (19Tanimura N. Nagafuku M. Minaki Y. Umeda Y. Hayashi F. Sakakura J. Kato A. Liddicoat D.R. Ogata M. Hamaoka T. Kosugi A. J. Cell Biol. 2003; 160: 125-135Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar), was clearly colocalized with this site. Thus, cholesterol patches seemed to correspond with lipid rafts, and the formation of cholesterol patches was not inhibited by d-PDMP (Fig. 3).Fig. 3The distribution of cholesterol and LAT-GFP in d-PDMP-treated cells. Jurkat-derived transfectants expressing LAT-GFP were incubated with d-PDMP for 3 days. Untreated or d-PDMP-treated cells were stained with biotinylated θ-toxin followed by streptavidin-Texas Red. The cells were observed by confocal microscopy. In the left lower panels are differential interference contrast (DIC) images. Colocalization of cholesterol and LAT-GFP is indicated by arrows.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) We next investigated the effect of d-PDMP on raft-localized proteins. An adaptor molecule, LAT, and Src-family kinase, Lck, are well known raft-resident proteins in T cells and play important roles in raft-mediated T cell activation (28Zhang W. Trible R.P. Samelson L.E. Immunity. 1998; 9: 239-246Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (747) Google Scholar, 29Kabouridis P.S. Magee A.I. Ley S.C. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 4983-4998Crossref PubMed Scopus (315) Google Scholar). As shown in Fig. 2C, LAT and Lck were highly enriched in the raft fraction and this localization was not impaired by d-PDMP treatment. We further analyzed stimulation-induced accumulation of a signaling protein into rafts in d-PDMP-treated cells. In response to TCR stimulation, PLCγ1 has been shown to accumulate into rafts by way of binding with LAT (30Zhang W. Trible R.P. Zhu M. Liu S.K. McGlade C.J. Samelson L.E. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 23355-23361Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (332) Google Scholar) and d-PDMP did not inhibit this response (Fig. 2D). In contrast to PLCγ1 accumulation, the localization of LAT was not changed before and after activation. Two forms of LAT at molecular masses of 36 and 38 kDa seem to correspond to palmitylated and non-palmitoylated forms, respectively, as described previously (28Zhang W. Trible R.P. Samelson L.E. Immunity. 1998; 9: 239-246Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (747) Google Scholar). In addition to the localization of LAT, Lck, and PLCγ1, we observed that total protein content and distribution were similar in the raft fractions from untreated and d-PDMP-treated cells (data not shown). Thus, d-PDMP appeared not to alter protein distribution in rafts from T cells with or without stimulation. Taken together, these results indicate that d-PDMP preferentially reduces the level of GSLs in rafts without affecting SM and cholesterol levels and the alteration of lipid contents did not induce a significant change in protein distribution in lipid rafts. TCR-mediated Signal Transduction in d-PDMP-treated T Cells—It has been well established that the process of TCR-mediated signaling is dependent upon raft structure and function (31Langlet C. Bernard A.M. Drevot P. He H.T. Curr. Opin. Immunol. 2000; 12: 250-255Crossref PubMed Scopus (209) Google Scholar). We next examined whether the reduction of GSLs in lipid rafts modulates TCR-mediated T cell activation. Surface TCR in d-PDMP-treated Jurkat cells was cross-linked with anti-CD3 mAb to activate TCR signaling pathways. As shown in Fig. 4, tyrosine phosphorylation of cellular proteins and Ca2+ mobilization, critical early signaling events for T cell activation, were successfully induced by TCR cross-linking and d-PDMP treatment was not able to inhibit these responses. In addition to these early signaling events, the expression of CD69, a marker for late activation events, was also not impaired by d-PDMP (data not shown). Thus, TCR signaling by anti-CD3 mAb stimulation was not inhibited in d-PDMP-treated cells. To examine whether the lack of effect of d-PDMP effect on the TCR signal is dependent on the strength of TCR stimulation, we stimulated T cells under more physiological conditions. Mouse T cell hybridomas, 2B4 cells, were treated with d-PDMP for 3 days, stimulated with various concentrations of antigenic peptide in the presence of APC, and then analyzed for IL-2 production. Although d-PDMP induced a similar inhibitory effect of GM1 expression on 2B4 cells (data not shown), IL-2 production was not changed even at low concentrations of antigen between untreated and d-PDMP-treated cells (Fig. 5). These results clearly demonstrated that raft structure with a reduced level of GSLs is still capable of transducing the signal through the TCR stimulated either with antigen or Ab cross-linking. GPI-anchored Proteins Become More Sensitive to PI-PLC Cleavage in d-PDMP-treated Cells—We next evaluated d-PDMP-induced changes in raft structure by analyzing the expression state of GPI-anchored proteins on the plasma membrane. Previous reports demonstrated that the sensitivity of GPI-anchored proteins to bacterial PI-PLC is heavily influenced by lipid components in membrane rafts (32Hanada K. Izawa K. Nishijima M. Akamatsu Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 13820-13823Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 33Lehto M.T. Sharom F.J. Biochemistry. 2002; 41: 1398-1408Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). Hence, we investigated whether a reduction of GSLs in rafts affects the PI-PLC sensitivity of GPI-anchored proteins in T cells. Untreated, d-PDMP-treated, and l-PDMP-treated Jurkat cells were treated with various concentrations of PI-PLC, and surface expression of CD59 was analyzed (Fig. 6A). Although the expression level per se was not changed, the sensitivity of CD59 to PI-PLC was apparently increased by d-PDMP. Decreased expression of CD59 because of PI-PLC cleavage was more obvious in d-PDMP-treated cells at a concentration of 50 milliu"

Although we have previously observed that myristoylated and non-myristoylated MARCKS proteins behave differently during calmodulin-agarose chromatography, the role of protein myristoylation in the MARCKS-calmodulin interaction remained to be elucidated. Here we demonstrate that the myristoyl moiety together with the N-terminal protein domain is directly involved in the MARCKS-calmodulin interaction. Both myristoylated and non-myristoylated recombinant MARCKS bound to calmodulin-agarose at low ionic strengths, but only the former retained the affinity at high ionic strengths. A quantitative analysis obtained with dansyl (5-dimethylaminonaphthalene-1-sulfonyl)-calmodulin showed that myristoylated MARCKS has an affinity higher than the non-myristoylated protein. Furthermore, a synthetic peptide based on the N-terminal sequence was found to bind calmodulin only when it was myristoylated. Only the N-terminal peptide but not the canonical calmodulin-binding domain showed the ionic strength-independent calmodulin binding. A mutation study suggested that the importance of the positive charge in the N-terminal protein domain in the binding.

Since the discovery of a covalent-bound myristoyl group in the catalytic subunit of cAMP-dependent protein kinase (1.Carr S.A. Biemann K. Shoji S. Parmelee D.C. Titani K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1982; 79: 6128-6131Crossref PubMed Scopus (255) Google Scholar), many proteins have been found to be modified not only with myristoyl group but also with a variety of fatty acids (2.Johnson D.R. Bhatnagar R.S. Knoll L.J. Gordon J.I. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1994; 63: 869-914Crossref PubMed Scopus (369) Google Scholar, 3.Towler D.A. Gordon J.I. Adams S.P. Glaser L. Annu. Rev.

Interestingly, the vast majority of acylated proteins are either proteins involved in cellular signaling or those of viral origin. Protein acylation is often essential for the proper functioning of these proteins (5.Garber E.A. Hanafusa H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1987; 84: 80-84Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar), although in the mechanism by which the modification exerts the effect is largely unknown. Of various kinds of acylation, myristoylation has been implied in the reversible membrane association due to its intermediate hydrophobicity (3.Towler D.A. Gordon J.I. Adams S.P. Glaser L. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1988; 57: 69-99Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 6.Peitzsch R.M. McLaughlin S. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 10436-10443Crossref PubMed Scopus (459) Google Scholar). Studies from our own and other laboratories (7.Taniguchi H. Manenti S. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 9960-9963Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 8.Kim J. Shishido T. Jiang X. Aderem A. McLaughlin S. J. Biol.

(myristoylated alanine-rich C kinase substrate) with membranes. In the case of recoverin, the binding of Ca2+ induces a drastic conformational change of the protein, and the myristoyl group hidden inside the protein will protrude from the protein and can interact with membrane (9.Ames J.B. Tanaka T. Stryer L. Ikura M. Curr. Opin. Struct. Biol. 1996; 6: 432-438Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar). The modification has also been shown to affect the protein stability of cAMP-dependent protein kinase (10.Yonemoto W. McGlone M.L. Taylor S.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 2348-2352Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). However, the involvement of the protein myristoylation in protein-protein interaction has never been clearly demonstrated, although the issue has been the subject of extensive studies (11.Kennedy M.T. Brockman H. Rusnak F. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 26517-262521Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar, 12.Senin I.I. Zargarov A.A. Alekseev A.M. Gorodovikova E.N. Lipkin V.M.

Commun. 1994; 203: 121-127Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). Recently, we have shown that the modification is directly involved in the interaction of a brain-specific protein kinase C substrate, CAP-23/NAP-22, with calmodulin (14.Takasaki A. Hayashi N. Matsubara M. Yamauchi E. Taniguchi H. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 11848-11853Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar, 15.Hayashi N. Izumi Y. Titani K. Matsushima N. Protein Sci. 2000; 9: 1905-1913Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). Furthermore, the phenomena is observed in the binding HIV-1 Nef with calmodulin (16.Hayashi N. Matsubara M. Jinbo Y. Titani K. Izumi Y. Matsushima N. Protein Sci. 2002; 11: 529-537Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). The acyl chain interacts with specifically with the hydrophobic pocket of calmodulin. Since the basic domain adjacent to the myristoyl group was found to be important for the CAP-23/NAP-22-calmodulin and HIV-1 Nef-calmodulin interaction, the interplay of the myristoyl group and the basic domain seems to function in a manner analogous to that found in the myristoylation-mediated protein-membrane interaction.MARCKS, a major in vivo substrate of protein kinase C as well as of proline-directed protein kinases such as mitogen-activated protein kinase (17.Taniguchi H. Manenti S. Suzuki M. Titani K. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 18299-18302Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), contains a highly conserved N-terminal domain with an N-terminal myristoyl group and a basic phosphorylation domain in the middle of the molecule that is at the same time the binding sites for calmodulin (18.Aderem A. Cell. 1992; 71: 713-716Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (428) Google Scholar, 19.Blackshear P.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 1501-1504Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The phosphorylation of the latter domain results in the disruption of the calmodulin binding of the domain (20.Graff J.M. Young T.N. Johnson J.D. Blackshear P.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 21818-21823Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 21.McIlroy B.K. Walters J.D. Blackshear P.J. Johnson J.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 4959-4964Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). We have previously shown that MARCKS binds to phospholipid membrane through both the N-terminal myristoyl moiety and the phosphorylation domain of basic amphiphilic nature (7.Taniguchi H. Manenti S. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 9960-9963Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Protein kinase C-dependent phosphorylation introduces negative charges into the positively charged effector domain, consequently neutralizing its interaction with acidic phospholipids and promoting its release from the membrane (7.Taniguchi H. Manenti S. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 9960-9963Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 8.Kim J. Shishido T. Jiang X. Aderem A. McLaughlin S. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 28214-28219Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). We have also discovered a demyristoylase activity of MARCKS and shown that the modification is dynamically regulated (22.Manenti S. Sorokine O. Dorsselaer Van A. Taniguchi H. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 8309-8313Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 23.Manenti S. Sorokine O. Dorsselaer Van A. Taniguchi H. Biochem. Soc. Trans. 1995; 23: 561-564Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar). During the course of these studies, we found that the presence of non-myristoylated pool of MARCKS (24.Manenti S. Sorokine O. Dorsselaer Van A. Taniguchi H. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 6878-6881Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Interestingly, the non-myristoylated MARCKS protein behaved differently from the myristoylated counterpart during purification procedures. While the latter bound tightly to calmodulin-agarose column in the presence of Ca2+, the former was eluted from the column with high ionic strength even in the presence of Ca2+ (24.Manenti S. Sorokine O. Dorsselaer Van A. Taniguchi H. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 6878-6881Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar).In this study, we have produced recombinant non-myristoylated (non-myr) and myristoylated (myr) MARCKS proteins and studied their binding properties to calmodulin in detail. Non-myr MARCKS was dissociated from calmodulin with high ionic strength in the presence of Ca2+, whereas myr MARCKS bound to calmodulin even at high ionic strength. Furthermore, we found that a myristoylated peptide based on the N-terminal MARCKS sequence bound to calmodulin only when it was myristoylated. The results obtained suggested that the N-terminal myristoylated domain is directed involved in the MARCKS-calmodulin interaction.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESMaterials—Dansyl-calmodulin and calmodulin-agarose were obtained from Sigma. Source 15Q ion exchange column was from Pharmacia Corp. Tryptone and yeast extracts were from Difco, while ampicillin, kanamycin, and isopropyl-1-thio-β-galactopylanoside were from Wako Pure Chemical Industries. A 25-amino acid peptide corresponding to the phosphorylation domain of MARCKS (KKKKKRFSFKKSFKLSGFSFKKNKK) was synthesized with a standard t-Boc chemistry using an Applied Biosystems peptide synthesizer 430A. A myristoylated peptide based on the N-terminal sequence of MARCKS (myr-GAQFSKTAAK) and its variants (myr-GAQASKTAAK, myr-GAQKSKTAAK, myr-GAQDSKTAAK, myr-GAQFSDTAAK), and a non-myristoylated peptide (GAQFSKTAAKGEATAER), synthesized using standard Fmoc (N-(9-fluorenyl)methoxycarbonyl) chemistry, were purchased from Research Genetics. The peptides were purified by reversed-phase high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) using a C18 column (Waters, μBondasphere 5 μ C18 –300Å, 1.9 × 15 cm). They were judged to be of greater than 95% purity by analytical HPLC and electrospray mass spectrometry (14.Takasaki A. Hayashi N. Matsubara M. Yamauchi E. Taniguchi H. J. Biol.

The Escherichia coli strain BL21(DE3)pLysS was obtained from Stratagene. The plasmid pBB131NMT was a gift from Dr. J. Gordon (Washington University).Expression and Purification of Non-myr MARCKS and Myr MARCKS—The E. coli strain BL21(DE3)pLysS was transformed with the plasmid pET3d containing the human MARCKS gene cloned by PCR based on the published sequence (26.Harlan D.M. Graff J.M. Stumpo D.J. Eddy Jr., R.L. Shows T.B. Boyle J.M. Blackshear P.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 14399-14405Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). For the construction, expression and purification of non-myr MARCKS, the published procedure was followed exactly as described previously (27.Verghese G.M. Johnson J.D. Vasulka C. Haupt D.M. Stumpo D.J. Blackshear P.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 9361-9367Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The cells containing the plasmid were selected with 100 μg/ml ampicillin. A frozen stock of transformed colonies was used to inoculate LB media containing 100 μg/ml ampicillin, and the cells were grown overnight 37 °C. 500 ml of LB medium containing 100 μ g/ml ampicillin was inoculated with the overnight culture. The cells were grown to an OD600 of ∼1–1.2, then further grown in the presence of 0.4 mm isopropyl-1-thio-β-galactopylanoside for 5 h. The cells were collected by centrifugation for 20 min at 8000 rpm at 4 °C (Hitachi 9-2 rotor) and kept frozen at –20 °C. Non-myr MARCKS was purified by a procedure as described previously (27.Verghese G.M. Johnson J.D. Vasulka C. Haupt D.M. Stumpo D.J. Blackshear P.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 9361-9367Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). For myr-MARCKS, the E. coli strain BL21(DE3)pLysS was transformed with the plasmid pBB131NMT, which contained the gene coding for yeast N-myristoyltransferase (NMT) (28.Duronio R.J. Jackson-Machelski E. Heuckeroth R.O. Olines P.O. Devine C.S. Yonemoto W. Slice L.W. Taylor S.S. Gordon J.I. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 1506-1510Crossref PubMed Scopus (200) Google Scholar). The strain BL21(DE3)pLysS-pBBNMT was then transformed with the plasmid pET3d vector containing the MARCKS gene. The bacterial culture was performed as described above except that 25 μg/ml kanamycin was also included in the media. Coexpression of MARCKS and NMT was induced by adding 0.4 mm isopropyl-1-thio-β-galactopylanoside to the log-phage culture. The cells were collected by centrifugation, resuspended in 5 volumes of ice-cold buffer (10 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5) containing 0.1% Triton X-100, 10 mm ditiothreitol, 1 mm EDTA, 0.2 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride) and sonicated three times for 5 min with a probe-type sonicator (Branson Sonifier 250). After centrifuging for 25 min at 18,000 rpm at 4 °C, the supernatants were collected and then placed in a boiling water bath for 20 min and immediately cooled to 0 °C. The precipitated proteins were removed by centrifugation for 20 min at 15,000 rpm at 4 °C. After adding 7 mm CaCl2 to the supernatant, the solution was loaded on a calmodulin-agarose column equilibrated with 40 mm Tris-HCl buffer (pH 7.5) containing 0.2 m NaCl, 0.1 mm ditiothreitol, and 7 mm CaCl2. The column was washed with 50 ml of the same buffer containing 0.5 m NaCl, 0.1 mm ditiothreitol, 7 mm CaCl2 and then with 50 ml of the buffer containing 0.1 mm ditiothreitol, 0.1 mm CaCl2. MARCKS was eluted with the same buffer containing 0.6 m NaCl, 1 mm ditiothreitol, and 2 mm EGTA. Fractions containing myr MARCKS were pooled and concentrated/buffer exchanged with 20 mm Tris-HCl buffer (pH 7.5) using Centricon 10 concentrator (Amicon). The purified proteins were kept frozen at –80 °C until use. We have prepared three separated MARCKS proteins. The purification and characterization of MARCKS proteins are stable in each preparation. Furthermore, we checked the reproducibility of the experiments and separate preparations did not affect the results of the several experiments. Molecular masses of the recombinant non-myr MARCKS and myr MARCKS proteins were determined to be 31,738 and 31,947 Da by electrospray mass spectrometry. The difference, 209 Da, corresponds very well to the mass difference of 210 Da expected for myristoylation. Although the calculated molecular mass of non-myr MARCKS based on the published cDNA sequence (26.Harlan D.M. Graff J.M. Stumpo D.J. Eddy Jr., R.L. Shows T.B. Boyle J.M. Blackshear P.J. J. Biol.

Manenti, personal communication. We concluded that the difference between myr and non-myr MARCKS resided solely in the N-terminal myristoylation. The stoichiometry of myristoylation was 1 for the myristoylated MARCKS protein. Protein concentration was determined by quantitative amino acid analysis or by densitometric analysis of the Coomassie Blue-stained SDS gels.Fluorescence Measurements—Binding of MARCKS or that of MARCKS peptides to dansyl-calmodulin was analyzed with a Jasco FP-777 spectrofluorometer using 1 × 1-cm quartz cuvette as described previously (30.Matsubara M.

With the excitation wavelength set at 340 nm, emission spectra of dansyl-calmodulin in the presence or absence of MARCKS/MARCKS peptide were recorded in 20 mm Tris-HCl buffer (pH 7.5) containing 0.1 m NaCl, 0.5 mm CaCl2. The fluorescence emission at 490 nm was used to calculate dissociation constant of calmodulin-MARCKS complexes by a direct fit of the data to the mass equation using a nonlinear least square method (30.Matsubara M.

Chem. 1997; 272: 23050-23056Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar).Binding of MARCKS to Calmodulin-Agarose—Binding of recombinant MARCKS proteins to calmodulin was assessed using calmodulin-agarose in 20 mm Tris-HCl buffer (pH 7.5) containing 0.5 mm CaCl2 and indicated concentrations of NaCl. After centrifugation in a tabletop centrifuge, the supernatants were removed (unbound fraction). The calmodulin-agarose was washed three times with the same buffer, and the bound proteins were eluted with the SDS sample buffer containing 1% SDS (bound fraction). Both unbound and bound fractions were analyzed by SDS-gel electrophoresis. The bands were quantified by scanning densitometry (Amersham Biosciences PDSI).RESULTSBinding of Myr and Non-myr MARCKS to Calmodulin—We have previously observed that non-myr MARCKS purified from soluble fractions of bovine brain does not bind to the calmodulin column as efficiently as the myr MARCKS (24.Manenti S. Sorokine O. Dorsselaer Van A. Taniguchi H. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 6878-6881Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The non-myr MARCKS can be eluted with high ionic strength even in the presence of Ca2+, whereas myr MARCKS is still bound to the column and can be eluted only in the absence of Ca2+. These observations suggest that the N-terminal myristoylation of MARCKS modulates the interaction of MARCKS with calmodulin, which is effected by the calmodulin-binding domain in the middle of the MARCKS molecule (20.Graff J.M. Young T.N. Johnson J.D. Blackshear P.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 21818-21823Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 24.Manenti S. Sorokine O. Dorsselaer Van A. Taniguchi H. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 6878-6881Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). To elucidate the underlying mechanism, we have produced recombinant human non-myr MARCKS and myr MARCKS proteins and studied the binding of the two forms to calmodulin in detail.First, the effects of ionic strength on the binding were assessed by calmodulin-agarose assay as described under “Experimental Procedures.” Both myr and non-myr MARCKS were mixed with calmodulin-agarose, and the bound protein was analyzed by SDS-gel electrophoresis. The extent of the binding of non-myr MARCKS to calmodulin-agarose gradually decreased with increasing concentrations of NaCl, whereas that of myr MARCKS was almost unaffected (Fig. 1). Even in the presence of 1 m NaCl, myr MARCKS did not lose its affinity to calmodulin-agarose, while the binding of non-myr MARCKS to calmodulin was almost abolished. When agarose beads were instead of calmodulin-agarose as a control, neither myr nor non-myr MARCKS showed significant binding to the agarose, demonstrating that we were dealing with specific interactions with calmodulin (data not shown). These results suggest that the myristoylation indeed affects the binding of MARCKS to calmodulin, and myr and non-myr MARCKS have different calmodulin-binding modes, especially in terms of the sensitivity to ionic strength.Next, fluorescence change of dansyl-calmodulin upon binding of target protein/peptides (30.Matsubara M. Hayashi N. Titani K. Taniguchi H. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 23050-23056Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar, 31.Matsubara M. Yamauchi E. Hayashi N. Taniguchi H. FEBS Lett. 1998; 421: 203-207Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar, 32.Johnson J.D. Wittenauer L.A. Biochem. J. 1983; 11: 473-479Crossref Scopus (108) Google Scholar) was used to analyze the binding quantitatively. The addition of 150 nm myr or non-myr MARCKS to 50 nm dansyl-calmodulin in a buffer containing 0.1 m NaCl induced similar shifts in the maxima of fluorescence emission spectra of dansyl-calmodulin from 510 to 490 nm and about 2-fold increases in the intensity, suggesting that both forms bound tightly to calmodulin (Fig. 2a). Although the two emission spectra obtained with myr and non-myr MARCKS were very similar, there was a clear difference in the peak maxima, and the difference was observed repeatedly. This phenomenon was definitely observed when both the concentration of dansyl-calmodulin and that of MARCKS were increased (data not shown). This may reflect a difference in the conformation of the calmodulin complexes. To obtain the dissociation constants, a fixed concentration of dansyl-calmodulin (50 nm) was titrated with either myr MARCKS or non-myr MARCKS, and the changes in the emission spectra at 490 nm were recorded (Fig. 2b). The dissociation constants obtained in 0.1 m NaCl were 4.5 ± 0.4 nm (n = 3) and 12.7 ± 3.7 nm (n = 3) for my MARCKS and non-myr MARCKS, respectively. The binding of myr MARCKS to calmodulin, therefore, is slightly but significantly tighter than the non-myr protein. Similarly, the dissociation constants were determined to be 130 and 470 nm at 0.25 m NaCl for myr MARCKS and non-myr MARCKS, respectively. Unfortunately, the fluorescence change became very small above 0.5 m NaCl, and no quantitative determination of the dissociation constants was possible. However, very little, if any, change in the fluorescence spectra was observed with non-myr MARCKS at NaCl concentrations above 0.75 m, while the addition of myr MARCKS still produced an increase in the fluorescence intensity and a shift in the peak maximum even at 1 m NaCl. Thus, the results obtained in solution were similar to those obtained with the calmodulin-agarose assay; myr MARCKS retained the affinity to calmodulin at high ionic strengths, while non-myr MARCKS lost the affinity.Fig. 2Binding of myr and non-myr MARCKS to dansyl-calmodulin.a, fluorescence spectra of 50 nm dansyl-calmodulin in the presence of 0.5 mm CaCl2 (solid line), plus 150 nm myr MARCKS (dashed line), plus 150 nm non-myr MARCKS (semi-dashed line). b, titration of dansyl-calmodulin (50 nm) with myr MARCKS (▪) and non-myr MARCKS (•). The representative data from two independent experiments are shown. Solid lines are theoretical curves calculated with dissociation constants obtained by the direct fit of the data to mass quation using non-linear least square method (30.Matsubara M. Hayashi N. Titani K. Taniguchi H. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 23050-23056Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). The data were fitted using Kd values of 4.2 nm (r = 0.997) for myr MARCKS and 11.0 nm (r = 0.996) for non-myr MARCKS.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Effects of Ionic Strength on the Calmodulin-Effector Domain Interaction—Since the involvement of the basic amphiphilic phosphorylation domain (residues 150–175 in bovine sequence) in the MARCKS-calmodulin interaction has been well demonstrated (20.Graff J.M. Young T.N. Johnson J.D. Blackshear P.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 21818-21823Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), it is of interest to examine the effects of ionic strength on the interaction of the domain with calmodulin. The fluorescence assay using dansyl-calmodulin gave a dissociation constant of 3.8 nm at 0.1 m NaCl, which was comparable with the values reported previously (20.Graff J.M. Young T.N. Johnson J.D. Blackshear P.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 21818-21823Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). When the titration was carried out at 0.5 m NaCl, a dissociation constant of 203 nm was obtained. Therefore, the binding of the basic phosphorylation domain to calmodulin is highly sensitive to ionic strength. Clearly, the sensitivity to ionic strength observed with non-myr MARCKS-calmodulin interaction reflects the characteristics of the calmodulin binding of the effector domain. In contrast, myr MARCKS retained the affinity to calmodulin even at high NaCl concentrations. These results suggest the presence of a second calmodulin-binding site in myr MARCKS that is insensitive to ionic strength.Interaction of N-terminal Myristoylation Peptide with Calmodulin—Since the only difference between the myr MARCKS and non-myr MARCKS is the presence of a myristoyl group at the N terminus, either the myristoyl moiety is directly involved in the interaction with calmodulin, or the modification induces a conformational change of the protein that may expose a new binding site. To assess the former possibility, a myristoylated peptide based on the N-terminal sequence (myr-GAQFSKTAAK) was synthesized, and the binding of the peptide to dansyl-calmodulin was examined. As shown in Fig. 3, the addition of the myristoylated peptide to dansyl-calmodulin at 0.1 m NaCl caused a drastic increase in the intensity and a shift of the peak maximum of the emission spectra similar to those observed with the myr and non-myr MARCKS proteins (see Fig. 2). On the other hand, no significant change in the fluorescence spectra was observed when a non-myristoylated N-terminal peptide (GAQFSKTAAKGEATAER) was added to calmodulin (Fig. 3). Furthermore, the addition of myristic acid alone or that of the mixture of myristic acid and non-myristoylated peptide to dansyl-calmodulin did not affect the fluorescence spectra significantly (data not shown). These results not only indicate that the myristoyl moiety is directly involved in the peptide-calmodulin interaction but also suggest that the N-terminal peptide part is also important for the interaction. The dissociation constant was calculated from the titration data to be 2.0 μm, a value that was lower than that obtained for the basic effector domain (3.8 nm), but similar to those observed with low-affinity calmodulin-binding proteins such as GAP-43 (33.Alexander K.A. Cimler B.M. Meier K.E. Storm D.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 6108-6113Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Interestingly, the binding of the myrstoylated N-terminal peptide to calmodulin was not affected by ionic strength. The dissociation constant obtained at 0.5 m NaCl was 1.5 μm, which was almost identical to that observed at 0.1 m NaCl.Fig. 3Fluorescence spectra of dansyl-calmodulin in the presence of N-terminal myristoylated peptides. Fluorescence spectra of 200 nm dansyl-calmodulin in the presence of 0.5 mm CaCl2 (solid line), plus 4 μm myristoylated peptide (dashed and dotted line), plus 4 μm non-myristoylated peptide (dashed line) were obtained as described under “Experimental Procedures.”View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)To study the role of the N-terminal protein moiety in the myristoylated peptide-calmodulin interaction, a series of myristoylated peptides were synthesized, and their binding characteristics to calmodulin were analyzed by fluorescence measurements. Since both hydrophobic and basic amino acids play important roles in the calmodulin-target-protein interactions (34.O'Neil K.T. DeGrado W.F. Trends Biochem.

https://openalex.org/W1980719921,"Abstract When RNA polymerase II (RNAP II) is forced to stall, elongation complexes (ECs) are observed to leave the active pathway and enter a paused state. Initially, ECs equilibrate between active and paused conformations, but with stalls of a long duration, ECs backtrack and become sensitive to transcript cleavage, which is stimulated by the EC rescue factor stimulatory factor II (TFIIS/SII). In this work, the rates for equilibration between the active and pausing pathways were estimated in the absence of an elongation factor, in the presence of hepatitis δ antigen (HDAg), and in the presence of transcription factor IIF (TFIIF), with or without addition of SII. Rates of equilibration between the active and paused states are not very different in the presence or absence of elongation factors HDAg and TFIIF. SII facilitates escape from stalled ECs by stimulating RNAP II backtracking and transcript cleavage and by increasing rates into and out of the paused EC. TFIIF and SII cooperate to merge the pausing and active pathways, a combinatorial effect not observed with HDAg and SII. In the presence of HDAg and SII, pausing is observed without stimulation of transcript cleavage, indicating that the EC can pause without backtracking beyond the pre-translocated state."

Early work showed that the minimal sequence for substrate phosphorylation by this enzyme was X-1(S/T0)P+1X+2(K/R+3), depicting an absolute requirement for proline at position P+1 and a positively charged residue being favored at position P+3 (P0 is the phosphorylation site) (3Shenoy S. Choi J.K. Bagrodia S. Copeland T.D. Maller J.L. Shalloway D. Cell. 1989; 57: 763-774Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (212) Google Scholar). Recently it has become clear that the amino acid substrate specificity determinants recognized by CDK1-cyclin B, CDK2-cyclin A, CDK2-cyclin E (4Holmes J.K. Solomon M.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 25240-25246Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar), and CDK5-p25 (5Beaudette K.N. Lew J. Wang J.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 20825-20830Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) are virtually identical. Importantly, short synthetic peptides that contain these determinants serve as highly efficient substrates for these enzymes, demonstrating that the primary sequence alone is sufficient for high catalytic activity (6Hagopian J.C.

Further, more comprehensive studies on the specificity of CDKs have employed two independent approaches to define the optimal structural determinants recognized by these enzymes. Classically, systematic amino acid substitution analysis of model peptide substrates allowed the contribution of each amino acid to overall catalytic efficiency to be deduced (4Holmes J.K. Solomon M.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 25240-25246Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar). In addition, the preferred substrate recognition sequence has been demonstrated independently by random screening of combinatorial peptide substrate libraries (7Songyang Z. Blechner S. Hoagland N. Hoekstra M.F. Piwnica-Worms H. Cantley L.C. Curr. Biol. 1994; 4: 973-982Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (526) Google Scholar). Both approaches have corroborated the optimal recognition motif for various CDK-cyclin complexes to be X(S/T0)P+1X+2(K/R+3). In all cases, the specificity of CDKs has been defined with respect to the phosphorylation of model peptide substrates. Recently, knowledge of in vivo protein substrates for a number of CDK family members has emerged (8Harper J.W. Adams P.D. Chem. Rev. 2001; 101: 2511-2526Crossref PubMed Scopus (197) Google Scholar). The best characterized include the retinoblastoma protein, Rb, and the transcription factor E2F, in which phosphorylation by CDK2-cyclin E and A are required to drive cells through the G1/S-phase border and S-phase of the cell division cycle (9Harbour J.W.

However, a dilemma regarding the recognition of these substrates is that their sites of phosphorylation invariably do not conform to the optimal consensus sequence motif as defined by model substrate peptides. For example, a comprehensive study shows that Lys or Arg at position P+2 and P+3 is optimal (4Holmes J.K. Solomon M.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 25240-25246Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar), yet these amino acids invariably are not employed at position P+2 nor, in many cases, P+3, in in vivo substrates (Table I). In some cases, Pro, the least favored determinant at P+2, is often found at this position.Table IPhosphorylation site motifs in representative cellular substrates of CDK2-cyclin AProteinP0 siteP0P+1P+2P+3pRb621SerProLysLyspRb780SerProIlePropRb788SerProTyrLyspRb795SerProLeuArgpRb807SerProLeuLyspRb811SerProTyrLyspRb821ThrProThrLyspRb826ThrProArgSerp53315SerProGlnProCdc654SerProArgLysCdc674SerProProLysCdc6106SerProSerLyshHR6A55SerProArgLyshHR6A74SerProProLyshHR6A106SerProSerLysMDM2216ThrProSerHisBRCA11497SerProSerLys Open table in a new tab In conjunction with such suboptimal phosphorylation site sequences, a distinct cyclin-binding motif termed the Cy motif, with consensus sequence RXL, has recently been identified in several physiological substrates of CDK2-cyclin A and E (8Harper J.W.

This motif, located C-terminally to the site of phosphorylation, has been shown to be critical for substrate targeting (13Adams P.D. Li X. Sellers W.R. Baker K.B. Leng X. Harper J.W. Taya Y.

Chem. 2001; 276: 1993-1997Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar), and it has been postulated to serve as a specificity determinant toward different cyclins (16Wohlschlegel J.A. Dwyer B.T. Takeda D.Y. Dutta A. Mol. Cell Biol. 2001; 21: 4868-4874Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). Notably, the Cy motif appears to be linked invariably to suboptimal phosphorylation motifs, whereas sites displaying X(S/T)P(K/R)(K/R) in proteins apparently do not require and are not associated with a Cy motif. In this study, we have examined the mechanistic basis for optimizing high catalytic efficiency and specificity in physiological substrates of CDK2-cyclin A by investigating the kinetic role of each determinant within the optimal CDK consensus sequence motif with respect to substrate binding versus phosphoryl transfer. We find that the Lys+2 and Lys+3 substrate determinants and the distally located Cy motif both enhance substrate binding, with little effect on phosphoryl transfer. Thus, these determinants are compensatory for each other in terms of thermodynamic binding. Interestingly, the increase in affinity attributable to the Cy motif impedes the rate of chemical phosphoryl transfer when fused to the optimal phosphorylation sequence. Thus, lowering the binding energy at the phosphorylation site favors catalysis. Our results prompt renewed investigation into the issue of CDK substrate specificity, and revisiting the question, “What is optimal?” CDK2-cyclin A—Human CDK2 (phospho-Thr160) in complex with bovine cyclin A3 (corresponding to residues 171-432 of human cyclin A; expressed with C-terminal His6 tag) was produced in Escherichia coli as previously described (6Hagopian J.C.

In brief, GST-CDK2 and GST-CAK1 (S. cerevisiae) were coexpressed in E. coli (BL21 DE3) followed by co-lysis with bacteria expressing cyclin A. Active CDK2-cyclin A was purified by glutathione-agarose chromatography followed by thrombin cleavage and then anion exchange chromatography on Uno Q (Bio-Rad). Peptides—peptides were synthesized at the University of Calgary (Alberta, Canada), by Peptidogenic Research (Livermore, CA), or by Genemed Synthesis (So. San Francisco, CA). Peptides were 95% pure estimated by high pressure liquid chromatography. Kinase Assays—Kinase assays and viscosometric studies were carried out as described previously (18Prowse C.N. Hagopian J.C.

In brief, peptide substrate of varying concentrations (0.5-5 Km) was phosphorylated with CDK2-cyclin A in the presence of saturating [γ-32P]ATP (1 mm, 300 cpm/pmol) (KmATP = 50 μm (17Stevenson L.M.

Saturating conditions for ATP were confirmed by doubling the ATP concentration and observing no change in initial velocity. The concentration of CDK2-cyclin A (10-500 nm) was adjusted to achieve a reasonable time course for phosphorylation. In all assays, less than 10% of substrate was turned over. Under these conditions, substrate phosphorylation varied linearly with time (not shown) verifying initial rate conditions. Reactions were stopped with 25% acetic acid and then subjected to ascending paper chromatography on P81 phosphocellulose (Whatman) using 20 mm H3PO4/water as solvent (18Prowse C.N. Hagopian J.C. Cobb M.H. Ahn N.G. Lew J. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 6258-6266Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). Radiolabel corresponding to phosphopeptide product was quantified by Cerenkov counting. Solvent Viscosometric Studies and Data Analysis—Solvent viscosometric assays were conducted by carrying out traditional substrate dependence studies in saturating ATP and varied sucrose concentrations (0-40% sucrose) (19Brouwer A.C. Kirsch J.F. Biochemistry. 1982; 21: 1302-1307Crossref PubMed Scopus (200) Google Scholar, 20Blacklow S.C. Raines R.T. Lim W.A. Zamore P.D. Knowles J.R. Biochemistry. 1988; 27: 683-733Crossref Scopus (243) Google Scholar). The relative solvent viscosities of buffers containing sucrose were measured using an Oswald viscometer (see Ref. 18Prowse C.N. Hagopian J.C. Cobb M.H. Ahn N.G. Lew J. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 6258-6266Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). Initial velocities were measured in buffer containing 4-5 different sucrose concentrations (0-40% sucrose) and plotted as a function of peptide substrate concentration. The result is a family of Michaelis-Menten plots, each individual plot corresponding to a different relative solvent viscosity value. The following equation describes the theoretical relationship among initial velocity, substrate concentration, and relative solvent viscosity.v=k2/η·k3·k4/η·E·S/(k4/η·(k-2/η+k3)+S·k2/η·(k3+k4/η))(Eq. 1) where E is the enzyme concentration, η is the relative solvent viscosity, and v is the initial velocity. The derivation of this equation is provided in Ref. 21Lew J. Biochemistry. 2003; 42: 849-856Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar in the supporting information section (available via the Internet). A global fit of Equation 1 to the initial velocity data provided a family of best-fit curves through the raw data. The Michaelis-Menten equation was then separately fit to each individual curve, and the apparent values for kcat and kcat/Km at each relative solvent viscosity were determined. A plot of appkcat/Km or appkcat as a function of the relative solvent viscosity is a linear relationship in which slope values give the viscosity effect on these parameters (designated kcat/Kmη or kcatη, respectively). The viscosity effect values for each peptide substrate are given as footnotes in Tables II and III. The viscosity effects and the intrinsic steady-state constants relate to the individual kinetic constants as follows.kcat/Kmη=k3/(k3+k-2)(Eq. 2) kcatη=k3/(k3+k4)(Eq. 3) kcat/Km=k2·k3/(k3+k-2)(Eq. 4) kcat=k3·k4/(k3+k4)(Eq. 5) Table IIKinetic effects of substitutions within the TPKK motifPeptidekcatKmKDaInferred from viscosity effects on kcat/Km and kcat, respectively, which for each peptide were determined as: 1, 0.2 ± 0.05, 0.6 ± 0.1; 2, 0.05 ± 0.2, 0.04 ± 0.1; 3, 0.01 ± 0.02, 0.04 ± 0.04; 4, 0.13 ± 0.1, 1.1 ± 0.12; 5, 0.01 ± 0.03, 1.0 ± 0.1; 6, 0.007 ± 0.1, 0.35 ± 0.1; 7, 0.01 ± 0.04, 0.32 + 0.03.k3aInferred from viscosity effects on kcat/Km and kcat, respectively, which for each peptide were determined as: 1, 0.2 ± 0.05, 0.6 ± 0.1; 2, 0.05 ± 0.2, 0.04 ± 0.1; 3, 0.01 ± 0.02, 0.04 ± 0.04; 4, 0.13 ± 0.1, 1.1 ± 0.12; 5, 0.01 ± 0.03, 1.0 ± 0.1; 6, 0.007 ± 0.1, 0.35 ± 0.1; 7, 0.01 ± 0.04, 0.32 + 0.03.s−1μMμMs−11 PKTPKKAKKL4.5 ± 1.5 (1)bNumbers in parentheses represent - fold changes relative to the parent peptide, PKTPKKAKKL.20 ± 5 (1)40 ± 8 (1)11 ± 2 (1)2 PKTAKKAKKL0.45 ± 0.15 (↓ 10)∼4300 (↑ 215)∼4300 (↑ 108)0.5 ± 0.03 (↓ 23)3 PKTGKKAKKL0.8 ± 0.2 (↓ 5.5)∼2500 (↑ 125)∼2500 (↑ 66)0.9 ± 0.02 (↓ 13)4 PKTPAKAKKL3.6 ± 1.8 (↓ 1.2)223 ± 55 (↑ 11)>2100 (↑ >50)>36 (↑ >3)5 PKTPEKAKKL3.3 ± 1.5 (↓ 1.4)225 ± 180 (↑ 7.5)>2250 (↑ >50)>33 (↑ >3)6 PKTPPKAKKL2.7 ± 0.4 (↓ 1.6)∼2000 (↑ 100)∼3000 (↑ 75)4.3 ± 2.1 (↓ 2.6)7 PKTPKAAKKL3.2 ± 1 (↓ 1.4)∼2500 (↑ 120)∼3600 (↑ 90)4.5 ± 0.6 (↓ 2.4)a Inferred from viscosity effects on kcat/Km and kcat, respectively, which for each peptide were determined as: 1, 0.2 ± 0.05, 0.6 ± 0.1; 2, 0.05 ± 0.2, 0.04 ± 0.1; 3, 0.01 ± 0.02, 0.04 ± 0.04; 4, 0.13 ± 0.1, 1.1 ± 0.12; 5, 0.01 ± 0.03, 1.0 ± 0.1; 6, 0.007 ± 0.1, 0.35 ± 0.1; 7, 0.01 ± 0.04, 0.32 + 0.03.b Numbers in parentheses represent - fold changes relative to the parent peptide, PKTPKKAKKL.

The program Scientist (Micromath, Salt Lake City, UT) was used to carry out all nonlinear regression analysis. The theory, methodology, data analysis, and key references relevant to solvent viscosometric kinetic techniques are reviewed in Ref. 21Lew J. Biochemistry. 2003; 42: 849-856Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar, in the supporting information section (available via the Internet). Solvent viscosometric analyses require proof that a given viscosogen affects only the rate of molecular diffusion and does not erroneously perturb the structures of the free enzyme, free substrate, or enzyme-substrate complex. We have previously demonstrated that poor peptide substrates of CDK2 display no viscosity effect on kcat in sucrose (6Hagopian J.C. Kirtley M.P. Stevenson L.M. Gergis R.M. Russo A.A. Pavletich N.P. Parsons S.M. Lew J. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 275-280Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). Thus the structure of the enzyme in the enzyme-substrate complex is not perturbed by this viscosogen. Similarly, we observed little to no viscosity effect on kcat/Km for any of the peptides tested (Peptide 9 was not tested), suggesting that the structures of the free peptides and free enzyme were similarly unperturbed. Kinetic Analysis of TPKK—The phosphorylation site sequences targeted by CDK2-cyclin A within physiological protein substrates invariably do not display the optimal recognition determinants established by analysis of model peptide substrates. Such determinants include Lys/Arg at position P+2, which enhance catalysis by 5-6-fold over Ala. Lys/Arg are also favored at position P+3, but in this case by nearly 100-fold over most other amino acids (4Holmes J.K. Solomon M.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 25240-25246Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar). By comparison, physiological substrates invariably display suboptimal amino acids at position P+2 and, less frequently, P+3, generating motifs predicted to exhibit dramatically poorer catalytic properties. In some cases, the P+2 amino acid is Pro, the worst determinant at this position (4Holmes J.K. Solomon M.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 25240-25246Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar). Table I shows representative sequences surrounding the sites of phosphorylation of several known physiologically relevant targets of CDK2-cyclin A. To understand the rationale for incorporating suboptimal recognition determinants into these substrates, we have investigated the kinetic role of each amino acid within the optimal motif. The synthetic peptide PKTPKKAKKL (Peptide 1) contains the optimal motif (underlined) for phosphorylation by CDK2-cyclin A (4Holmes J.K. Solomon M.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 25240-25246Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar) and consequently has been shown to be a highly efficient substrate (kcat/Km = 105-106m-1 s-1) for this enzyme (6Hagopian J.C. Kirtley M.P. Stevenson L.M. Gergis R.M. Russo A.A. Pavletich N.P. Parsons S.M. Lew J. J. Biol.

Biochemistry. 2002; 41: 8528-8534Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). The detailed kinetic mechanism for phosphorylation of this peptide has been elucidated using steady-state solvent viscosometric techniques (6Hagopian J.C. Kirtley M.P. Stevenson L.M. Gergis R.M. Russo A.A. Pavletich N.P. Parsons S.M. Lew J. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 275-280Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar, 17Stevenson L.M. Deal M.S. Hagopian J.C. Lew J. Biochemistry. 2002; 41: 8528-8534Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). These experiments were repeated here to investigate the kinetic basis for substrate specificity. Peptide 1 binds to CDK2-cyclin A with a KD value of 40 μm and is turned over at a maximum rate of ∼4.5 s-1. The turnover rate is limited by both the rate of the phosphoryl transfer reaction (11 s-1) and the net dissociation of products from the active site (7.6 s-1). These numbers vary slightly from those that we have previously reported (6Hagopian J.C. Kirtley M.P. Stevenson L.M. Gergis R.M. Russo A.A. Pavletich N.P. Parsons S.M. Lew J. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 275-280Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar, 17Stevenson L.M. Deal M.S. Hagopian J.C. Lew J. Biochemistry. 2002; 41: 8528-8534Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar), a variation that we attribute to experimental error. We have synthesized a number of derivatives of Peptide 1 that incorporate substitutions at each of the critical amino acid positions. Employing steady-state solvent viscosometric techniques (21Lew J. Biochemistry. 2003; 42: 849-856Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar, 22Adams J.A. Taylor S.S. Biochemistry. 1992; 31: 8516-8522Crossref PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar, 23Adams J.A. Chem. Rev. 2001; 101: 2271-2290Crossref PubMed Scopus (473) Google Scholar), we have investigated the effects of such substitutions on either substrate binding affinity (KD = k-2/k2) or the rate of chemical phosphoryl transfer (k3) (see Scheme 1). The results are summarized in Table II. Substitution of all residues in the minimal motif was found to profoundly affect substrate binding affinity (Kd) (Table II), including substitution of the phosphorylation site itself with Ala (not shown). Although such nonphosphorylatable substrate analogues often retain high binding affinity and thus display potent kinase inhibitory activity (24Walsh D.A. Angelos K.L. Van Patten S.M. Glass D.B. Garetto L.P. Kemp B.E. Peptides and Protein Phosphorylation. CRC Press, Boca Raton, FL1990: 44-84Google Scholar), the nonphosphorylatable analogue of Peptide 1 displayed little to no inhibitory activity (at 10 μm Peptide 1). Thus, the minimum Kd value for the nonphosphorylatable peptide is in the low millimolar range. The role of Pro+1 in binding affinity may relate to the energetic cost of desolvating any other residue at this position upon binding, which the crystal structures of extracellular signal-regulated kinase-2 (25Canagarajah B.J. Khokhlatchev A. Cobb M.H. Goldsmith E.J. Cell. 1997; 90: 859-869Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (615) Google Scholar) and CDK2-cyclin A (26Brown N.R. Noble M.E.M. Endicott J.A. Johnson L.N. Nat. Cell Biol. 1999; 1: 438-443Crossref PubMed Scopus (470) Google Scholar) reveal would not be compensated by hydrogen bonding. The role of Lys+3 in substrate binding is consistent with the crystal structure of CDK2-cyclin A, which shows hydrogen bonding between the enzyme phosphoryl group at Thr160 and the side chain of Lys+3 in a peptide substrate (26Brown N.R. Noble M.E.M. Endicott J.A. Johnson L.N. Nat. Cell Biol. 1999; 1: 438-443Crossref PubMed Scopus (470) Google Scholar). However, the role of Lys+2 in substrate binding is less clear. In the crystal structure its side chain shows no interaction with the enzyme but instead points into the bulk solvent (26Brown N.R. Noble M.E.M. Endicott J.A. Johnson L.N. Nat. Cell Biol. 1999; 1: 438-443Crossref PubMed Scopus (470) Google Scholar). Although replacement of Lys+2 or Lys+3 to Ala, Glu, or Pro profoundly affected substrate binding, the same substitutions had little to no effect on the rates of either phosphoryl transfer (k3) or overall turnover (kcat). Only the substitution of Pro+1 (for Ala or Gly) had significant effect on reducing the rate of the chemical transfer step along the reaction pathway (Table II). Our kinetic results are similar to steady-state kinetic parameters reported previously for CDK5-p25 (5Beaudette K.N. Lew J. Wang J.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 20825-20830Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Substitution of Lys+2 or Lys+3 to Ala in Peptide 1 shows dramatic effects on Km, with little effect on kcat for this enzyme (5Beaudette K.N. Lew J. Wang J.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 20825-20830Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The specificity of CDK5-p25 has been shown to be virtually identical to that of CDK1-cyclin B (5Beaudette K.N. Lew J. Wang J.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 20825-20830Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), which, in turn, has been demonstrated to be identical to that of CDK2-cyclin A (4Holmes J.K. Solomon M.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 25240-25246Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar). Other peptide sequences have also been used previously to analyze the specificity of CDK1-cyclin B (27Srinivasan J. Koszelak M. Mendelow M. Kwon Y.G. Lawrence D.S. Biochem. J. 1995; 309: 927-931Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar, 28Marshak D.R. Vandenberg M.T. Bae Y.S. Yu I.J. J. Cell. Biochem. 1991; 45: 391-400Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). These include sequences based on the known phosphorylation sites in SV40 large T antigen (ADAQHATPPKKKRKVEDPKEF) and the mammalian tumor suppressor, p53 (RAALPNNTSSSPQPKKKPLDGEY) (28Marshak D.R. Vandenberg M.T. Bae Y.S. Yu I.J. J. Cell. Biochem. 1991; 45: 391-400Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). In these cases (27Srinivasan J. Koszelak M. Mendelow M. Kwon Y.G. Lawrence D.S. Biochem. J. 1995; 309: 927-931Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar, 28Marshak D.R. Vandenberg M.T. Bae Y.S. Yu I.J. J. Cell. Biochem. 1991; 45: 391-400Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar), less dramatic effects were observed on Km. However, in all cases (5Beaudette K.N. Lew J. Wang J.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 20825-20830Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 27Srinivasan J. Koszelak M. Mendelow M. Kwon Y.G. Lawrence D.S. Biochem.

Biochem. 1991; 45: 391-400Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar) it was apparent that kcat remained virtually unchanged in response to substitution at the substrate P+2 or P+3 positions. In only one study were dramatic effects on turnover rate (kcat) in response to substitution of Lys+3 reported (29Holmes J.K. Solomon M.J. Eur. J. Biochem. 2001; 268: 4647-4652Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). In this study (29Holmes J.K. Solomon M.J. Eur. J. Biochem. 2001; 268: 4647-4652Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar), the specificity of CDK2-cyclin A was tested using short peptide sequences fused to GST. Beyond this distinction, reasons for the kinetic disparity are not clear. The majority of evidence shows that the substrate P+2 and P+3 residues are dispensable for catalytic turnover but are crucial for substrate binding. Interestingly"
https://openalex.org/W1996576813,"Recognition of the 3′ splice site in mammalian introns is accomplished by association of the splicing factor U2AF with the precursor mRNA (pre-mRNA) in a multiprotein splicing commitment complex. It is well established that this interaction involves binding of the large U2AF65 subunit to sequences upstream of the 3′ splice site, but the orientation of the four domains of this protein with respect to the RNA and hence their role in structuring the commitment complex remain unclear and the basis of contradictory models. We have examined the interaction of U2AF65 with an RNA representing the 3′ splice site using a series of U2AF deletion mutants modified at the N terminus with the directed hydroxyl radical probe iron-EDTA. These studies, combined with an analysis of extant high resolution x-ray structures of protein·RNA complexes, suggest a model whereby U2AF65 bends the pre-mRNA to juxtapose reactive functionalities of the pre-mRNA substrate and organize these structures for subsequent spliceosome assembly."
https://openalex.org/W2086685356,"The bacterial enzyme, glycerol-3-phosphate cytidylyltransferase (GCT), is a model for mammalian cytidylyltransferases and is a member of a large superfamily of nucleotidyltransferases. Dimeric GCT from Bacillus subtilis displays unusual negative cooperativity in substrate binding and appears to form products only when both active sites are occupied by substrates. Here we describe a complex of GCT with the product, CDP-glycerol, in a crystal structure in which bound sulfate serves as a partial mimic of the second product, pyrophosphate. Binding of sulfate to form a pseudo-ternary complex is observed in three of the four chains constituting the asymmetric unit and is accompanied by a backbone rearrangement at Asp11 and ordering of the C-terminal helix. Comparison with the CTP complex of GCT, determined previously, reveals that in the product complex the active site closes around the glycerol phosphate moiety with a concerted motion of the segment 37-47 that includes helix B. This rearrangement allows lysines 44 and 46 to interact with the glycerol and cytosine phosphates of CDP-glycerol. Binding of CDP-glycerol also induces smaller movements of residues 92-100. Roles of lysines 44 and 46 in catalysis have been confirmed by mutagenesis of these residues to alanine, which decreases Vmax(app) and has profound effects on the Km(app) for glycerol-3-phosphate."

The enzyme is found in a degradative pathway for the xenobiotic nematocide trans-1,3-dichloropropene. MSAD has no sequence homology to previously characterized decarboxylases, but the presence of a conserved motif (Pro1-(X)8 -Gly-Arg11-X-Asp-X-Gln) in its N-terminal region suggested a relationship to the tautomerase superfamily. Sequence analysis identified Pro1 and Arg75 as potential active site residues that might be involved in the MSAD activity. The results of site-directed mutagenesis experiments confirmed the importance of these residues to activity and provided further evidence to implicate MSAD as a new member of the tautomerase superfamily. MSAD is the first identified decarboxylase in the superfamily and is possibly the first characterized member of a new and distinct family within this superfamily. Malonate semialdehyde is analogous to a β-keto acid, and enzymes that catalyze the decarboxylation of these acids generally utilize metal ion catalysis, a Schiff base intermediate, or polarization of the carbonyl group by hydrogen bonding and/or electrostatic interactions. A mechanistic analysis shows that the rate of the reaction is not affected by the presence of a metal ion or EDTA while the incubation of MSAD with the substrate in the presence of sodium cyanoborohydride results in the irreversible inactivation of the enzyme. The site of modification is Pro1. These observations are consistent with the latter two mechanisms, but do not exclude the first mechanism.

The trans-1,3-dichloropropene catabolic pathway is elaborated by the soil bacterium Pseudomonas pavonaceae 170 and enables the organism to use trans-1,3-dichloropropene (Scheme 1, 1) as a sole source of carbon and energy (1.Poelarends G.J.

Based on sequence comparisons, subunit size, and oligomeric structure, CaaD was identified as a member of the tautomerase superfamily (4.Poelarends G.J. Saunier R. Janssen D.B. J. Bacteriol. 2001; 183: 4269-4277Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). The members of this superfamily are structurally homologous proteins that share a characteristic β-α-β fold as well as a catalytic N-terminal proline (6.Whitman C.P. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 2002; 402: 1-13Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar). Site-directed mutagenesis studies of CaaD confirmed the catalytic importance of Pro1 (4.Poelarends G.J. Saunier R. Janssen D.B. J.

Although the decarboxylation of 3 to generate 4 is quite facile and proceeds non-enzymatically, it is presumably accelerated by an enzyme in this catabolic pathway. In this regard, the two genes coding for the α- and β-subunits of CaaD (caaD1 and caaD2, respectively in Fig. 1) are found within a cluster of genes that includes two additional open reading frames located immediately downstream (4.Poelarends G.J. Saunier R. Janssen D.B. J. Bacteriol. 2001; 183: 4269-4277Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). One is a gene that codes for a protein having 130 amino acids (designated orf130) and the second one is a partial gene that codes for a 178-amino acid segment of a protein (designated orf4). The partial orf4 sequence has a high degree of sequence identity with putative alcohol dehydrogenases in Bacillus subtilis (47%) and Escherichia coli (56%) (4.Poelarends G.J. Saunier R. Janssen D.B. J. Bacteriol. 2001; 183: 4269-4277Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar), indicating that the protein encoded by orf4 is not likely to function as a decarboxylase. Thus, it was hypothesized that orf130 might encode a malonate semialdehyde decarboxylase (MSAD) that converts 3 to 4. In order to test this hypothesis, the orf130 gene was cloned and expressed, and the enzyme purified. Using 1H NMR spectroscopy, it was determined that the orf130 gene product catalyzes the decarboxylation of 3 to yield acetaldehyde, thereby confirming its function as a MSAD. On the basis of sequence analysis, MSAD was identified as a member of the tautomerase superfamily and Pro1 and Arg75 were predicted to be critical for activity. These observations were confirmed by site-directed mutagenesis. A mechanistic analysis of the reaction suggests the involvement of a Schiff base intermediate or the polarization of the β-keto group by hydrogen bonding and/or electrostatic interactions. Roles for Pro1 and Arg75 are assigned in both mechanisms. While the results argue against a third mechanism utilizing metal ion catalysis, such a mechanism cannot be excluded. This is the first report of a tautomerase superfamily member that catalyzes a decarboxylation reaction, further demonstrating the versatility of the β-α-β structural motif as a template for new enzymatic activities. Materials—Chemicals and biochemicals were purchased from Fisher Scientific Inc., Fluka Chemical Co. (Milwaukee, WI), Sigma-Aldrich Chemical Co., or EM Science (Cincinnati, OH), unless stated otherwise. CaaD was purified by a published procedure (5.Wang S.C. Person M.D. Johnson Jr., W.H. Whitman C.P. Biochemistry. 2003; 42: 8762-8773Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). Tryptone, yeast extract, and agar were obtained from BD Biosciences (Franklin Lakes, NJ). Molecular biology enzymes, endoproteinase Glu-C (protease V8), DNA ladders, protein molecular weight standards, the high pure plasmid isolation kit, the high pure PCR product purification kit, multipurpose agarose, and the deoxynucleotide triphosphates (dNTPs) were purchased from F. Hoffmann-La Roche, Ltd. (Basel, Switzerland). The pET-3a vector was obtained from Promega Corp. (Madison, WI). Oligonucleotides for DNA amplification and sequencing were synthesized by Genosys (The Woodlands, TX). The Amicon concentrator and the YM3 and YM10 ultrafiltration membranes were obtained from Millipore Corp. (Bedford, MA). The membrane tubing was purchased from Spectrum Laboratory Products, Inc. (Gardena, CA). Pre-packed PD-10 Sephadex G-25 columns were obtained from Biosciences AB (Uppsala, Sweden). Bacterial Strains and Plasmids—E. coli strain BL21(DE3) was obtained from Promega Corp., and was used for the cloning of the PCR products, plasmid DNA isolation, and the overproduction of MSAD and the mutant enzymes. The pET3a expression vector (Promega Corp.) was used for the expression of orf130 and the mutant genes. The recombinant cosmid pPS41 contains the trans-3-chloroacrylate catabolic gene cluster of P. pavonaceae 170 and was used as the DNA template for the PCR amplification of the orf130 gene. 2The nucleotide sequence for the trans-3-chloroacrylate catabolic gene cluster, which includes the orf130 gene, has been deposited in the GenBank™ database under Accession Number AJ290446. In light of this work, the orf130 gene has been renamed msaD. Its construction is described elsewhere (4.Poelarends G.J. Saunier R. Janssen D.B. J. Bacteriol. 2001; 183: 4269-4277Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). General Methods—Techniques for restriction enzyme digestion, ligation, transformation, and other standard molecular biology manipulations were based on methods described by Sambrook et al. (7.Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. 2nd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar). The PCR was carried out in a PerkinElmer DNA thermocycler Model 480 obtained from PerkinElmer Inc. (Wellesley, MA). DNA sequencing was performed by the DNA Core Facility in the Institute for Cellular and Molecular Biology (The University of Texas at Austin). HPLC was performed on a Waters (Milford, MA) 501/510 system using either a TSKgel DEAE-5PW (anion exchange) column or a TSKgel Phenyl-5PW (hydrophobic interaction) column (Tosoh Bioscience, Montgomeryville, PA). Protein was analyzed by sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE) under denaturing conditions or by PAGE under native conditions on gels containing 15% polyacrylamide. The gels were stained with Coomassie Brilliant Blue. Protein concentrations were determined with the Bio-Rad protein assay or by measuring the absorbance of the protein in 20 mm NaH2PO4 buffer (pH 6.5) containing 6.0 m guanidium hydrochloride, at 280 nm (for wild-type MSAD, A0.1% = 0.775). Absorbance data were obtained on a Hewlett Packard 8452A Diode Array spectrophotometer. Nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectra were recorded in 100% H2O on a Varian Unity INOVA-500 spectrometer using selective pre-saturation of the water signal with a 2-s presaturation interval. The lock signal is dimethyl-d6 sulfoxide (DMSO-d6). Chemical shifts are standardized to the DMSO-d6 signal at 2.49 ppm. The N-terminal amino acid sequencing was performed by Eurosequence BV (Groningen, The Netherlands) using chemicals, reagents, and a sequenator (Model 477A) obtained from Applied Biosystems (Warrington, UK). The native molecular masses of the purified MSAD and its mutants were determined by gel filtration chromatography using a Superose 12 (Amersham Biosciences) column connected to the Waters 501/510 HPLC system. Sequence Analysis—BLAST and iterative PSI-BLAST searches of the National Center for Biotechnology Information (NCBI) databases were performed using the translated amino acid sequence of the orf130 gene from P. pavonaceae 170 as the query sequence (8.Altschul S.F. Madden T.L. Schäffer A.A. Zhang J. Zhang Z. Miller W. Lipman D.J. Nucleic Acids Res. 1997; 25: 3389-3402Crossref PubMed Scopus (59926) Google Scholar). The databases were searched with the “NR” option (all non-redundant GenBank™ CDS translations + PDB + SwissProt + PIR + PRF). Amino acid sequences were aligned using a version of the ClustalW multiple sequence alignment routines available in the computational tools at the EMBL-EBI Web site (9.Thompson J.D. Higgins D.G. Gibson T.J. Nucleic Acids Res. 1994; 22: 4673-4680Crossref PubMed Scopus (55761) Google Scholar). Polymerase Chain Reaction—The amplification reaction mixtures (100 μl) contained the standard Taq amplification buffer, 200 μm of each dNTP, 100 ng of each primer, 100 ng of template DNA, and 2 units of TaqDNA polymerase. The cycling parameters were 94 °C for 5 min followed by 30 cycles of 94 °C for 60 s, 58 °C for 60 s, and 72 °C for 90s, with a final elongation step of 72 °C for 10 min. The reaction mixtures were subjected to electrophoresis in 0.8% agarose gels, and PCR products were stained with ethidium bromide. Construction of Expression Vector—The orf130 gene was amplified by the PCR using the cosmid pPS41 as the template and the forward and reverse primers 5′-ATACATATGCCACTTCTCAAGTTC-3′ (designated primer F) and 5′-CATGGATCCTCAGACGAGGTCCCCAGT-3′ (designated primer R), respectively. The forward primer contains a NdeI restriction site (in bold) and the reverse primer has a BamHI restriction site (in bold). The PCR reaction was carried out as described above and the PCR product was purified using the high pure PCR product purification kit. The restriction sites NdeI and BamHI, introduced during the amplification reaction, were used to clone orf130 into the plasmid pET3a, yielding plasmid pET(orf130), for overexpression under control of the T7 promoter. The cloned orf130 gene was sequenced in order to confirm that no mutations had been introduced in the amplification reaction. Site-directed Mutagenesis—The P1A and R11A mutants of MSAD were generated by the PCR using the primers 5′-ATACATATG-GCACTTCTCAAGTTC-3′ and 5′-ATACATATGCCACTTCTCAAGTTCGACATCTTCTACGGGGCAACCGACGCT-3′, where the NdeI restriction sites are shown in bold and the codons for the desired mutations are underlined. These primers anneal to the 5′-end of the wild-type coding sequence and were used in combination with primer R. The R75A mutant was generated by overlap extension PCR as described elsewhere (10.Ho S.N. Hunt H.D. Horton R.M. Pullen J.K. Pease L.R. Gene (Amst.). 1989; 77: 51-59Crossref PubMed Scopus (6833) Google Scholar) using primers F and R as the external primers. The internal PCR primers were oligonucleotides 5′-GTGATATCTCGACCTGCATCAGAAGAGCAGAAGGTC-3′ and 5′-GACCTTCTGCTCTTCTGATGCAGGTCGAGATATCAC-3′ (the mutated codon is underlined). The PCR reactions were carried out as described above, the products purified and cloned into plasmid pET3a for expression of the mutant genes. The mutant genes were sequenced in order to verify that only the intended changes had been introduced. Expression and Purification of MSAD and the Mutant Enzymes— Bacterial cells were grown at 37 °C in Luria-Bertani (LB) medium supplemented with ampicillin (Ap) (100 μg/ml) when appropriate. E. coli BL21(DE3) transformants containing the desired plasmid were collected from a plate by resuspending them in LB medium (1 ml), which was then used to inoculate 50 ml of LB/Ap medium so that an initial OD600 of about 0.05 was obtained. After overnight growth at 37 °C, the culture was used to inoculate 1 liter of LB/Ap medium. This culture was grown at 37 °C for 45 min to an OD600 of ∼0.6, at which time 0.5 mm isopropyl-β-d-thiogalactoside (IPTG) was added to induce expression of the genes encoding MSAD and its mutants. Cells were harvested 5 h after induction by centrifugation (10 min at 10,000 × g), washed with 0.1 volume of 10 mm Tris-SO4 buffer, pH 8 (Buffer A), and stored at –20 °C until used. In a typical purification procedure, cells from three 1-liter cultures were thawed, combined, and suspended in 15 ml of Buffer A. Cells were disrupted by sonication for 30 s per ml of suspension at a 60 watts output using a W385 sonicator from Heat systems-Ultrasonics, Inc. (Farmingdale, NY), after which unbroken cells and debris were removed by centrifugation (30 min at 20,000 × g). The supernatant was filtered through a 0.2-μm pore diameter filter and applied to the TSKgel DEAE-5PW column (150 × 21.5 mm), which had previously been equilibrated with Buffer A. The column was washed with 50 ml of Buffer A, and retained proteins were eluted with a 300-ml increasing linear gradient of 0–0.5 m Na2SO4 in Buffer A at a flow rate of 5 ml/min. Fractions (10 ml) that showed the highest decarboxylase activity were pooled and concentrated to about 10 ml using an Amicon-stirred cell equipped with a YM3 (3,000 MW cutoff) or a YM10 (10,000 MW cutoff) ultrafiltration membrane. Subsequently, solid (NH4)2SO4 was added to a concentration of 1 m and the resulting solution was stirred for 60 min at 4 °C. After centrifugation (30 min at 20,000 × g), the supernatant was loaded onto the TSKgel Phenyl-5PW column (150 × 21.5 mm), which had previously been equilibrated with Buffer B (1 m (NH4)2SO4 in Buffer A). The column was washed with 50 ml of Buffer B, and retained proteins were eluted with a 250-ml decreasing linear gradient of 1.0–0 m (NH4)2SO4 in Buffer A at a flow rate of 5 ml/min. Fractions (10 ml) with the highest decarboxylase activity were pooled and concentrated to about 3 ml. The concentrate was loaded onto a Sephadex G-75 column (100 × 2.5 cm), previously equilibrated with Buffer A. The protein was eluted with Buffer A at a flow rate of 1 ml/min. Fractions (9 ml) with the highest decarboxylase activity were analyzed by SDS-PAGE, and those that contained purified enzyme were pooled and concentrated to a protein concentration of about 5 mg/ml. The purified enzymes were filtered through a 0.2-μm pore diameter filter and stored at 4 °C. The mutant enzymes exhibited sufficient activity such that fractions containing them could be identified by an activity assay. Mass Spectrometric Characterization of MSAD, MSAD Modified by 3 or 4, and the MSAD Mutants—The masses of MSAD, MSAD modified by 3 or 4, and the three mutants of MSAD were determined using an LCQ electrospray ion trap mass spectrometer (ThermoFinnigan, San Jose, CA), housed in the Analytical Instrumentation Facility Core in the College of Pharmacy at the University of Texas at Austin. The protein samples were made up as described elsewhere (5.Wang S.C. Person M.D. Johnson Jr., W.H. Whitman C.P. Biochemistry. 2003; 42: 8762-8773Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). The observed monomer mass for MSAD was 14,106 Da (calc. 14,109 Da). The observed monomer mass for the P1A mutant was 14,080 Da (calc. 14,080 Da), that of the R11A mutant was 14,022 Da (calc. 14,021 Da), and that of the R75A was 14,021 Da (calc. 14,021 Da). The masses for the modified MSAD samples are reported below. 1H NMR Spectroscopic Assay for MSAD Activity Using 3—The 1H NMR spectra monitoring the enzymatic decarboxylation of 3 by MSAD were generated as follows. An amount of 2 (4 mg, 0.04 mmol) dissolved in DMSO-d6 (30 μl) was added to 100 mm Na2HPO4 buffer (0.6 ml; pH ∼9) in an NMR tube. The pH of the buffer was adjusted to 8.5. Subsequently, an aliquot of CaaD (50 μl of a 11 mg/ml solution made up in 20 mm Na2HPO4 buffer, pH 7.3) was added to the reaction mixture. 1H NMR spectra were recorded 1.5, 6, and 10 min after mixing. After 14 min, an aliquot of MSAD (100 μl of a 9.1 mg/ml solution made up in 20 mm Na2HPO4 buffer, pH 7.3) was added to the reaction mixture. 1H NMR spectra were recorded 1.5 and 4.75 min after the addition of MSAD. The reaction was completed after 4.75 min. The final pH of the reaction mixture was 7.20. In a second experiment, an identical reaction mixture was placed in an NMR tube along with an aliquot of MSAD (100 μl of a 9.1 mg/ml solution made up in 20 mm Na2HPO4 buffer, pH 7.3). The pH of the buffer was adjusted to 8.5. The reaction was initiated by the addition of the same quantity of CaaD. 1H NMR spectra were recorded 1.5, 6 and 10 min after the addition of CaaD. The final pH of the reaction mixture was 7.13. In a third experiment, the same reaction mixture was placed in an NMR tube along with a smaller quantity of MSAD (2.5 μl of a 0.91 mg/ml solution made up in 20 mm Na2HPO4 buffer, pH 7.3). The reaction was started by the addition of the same quantity of CaaD. 1H NMR spectra were recorded every 3 min after the addition of CaaD until the reaction was completed (27 min). The signals for 2, 3, and 4 (and the hydrates of 3 and 4) are reported elsewhere (5.Wang S.C. Person M.D. Johnson Jr., W.H. Whitman C.P. Biochemistry. 2003; 42: 8762-8773Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). Spectrophotometric Assays for MSAD Activity—Two assays were used to quantify MSAD activity. In the first assay, the activity of MSAD was monitored by following the production of NADH at 340 nm in a coupled assay using the β-NAD+-dependent aldehyde dehydrogenase at 22 °C. The assay mixture (1 ml final volume) consisted of 50 mm Na2HPO4 buffer (pH 9.0), 5 mm β-NAD+, 1–4 units/ml of aldehyde dehydrogenase (1 unit will oxidize 10 μmol of 4 to acetic acid per min at 25 °C at pH 8 in the presence of β-NAD+), and 3 (11.Tamaki N. Hama T. Methods Enzymol. 1982; 89: 469-473Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). The substrate 3 was generated in situ by the incubation of 2 with CaaD as follows. Varying amounts (1–10 μl) of 2 from a stock solution (10, 50, or 500 mm) made up in 100 mm Na2HPO4 buffer (pH 9.0) and CaaD (5 μl; 40–80 μg) were added to the assay mixture. When there is no further decrease in absorbance at 224 nm (indicating that 2 has been converted to 3) (5.Wang S.C. Person M.D. Johnson Jr., W.H. Whitman C.P. Biochemistry. 2003; 42: 8762-8773Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar), a quantity of MSAD (1.5 μl; 0.3 μg) was added to the assay mixture and the increase in absorbance at 340 nm was followed. The initial rate of NADH formation is proportional to the concentration of MSAD at all substrate concentrations examined. Under these conditions, 3 is in equilibrium with the hydrate and the chemical decarboxylation of 3 is negligible as is the oxidation of 3 by aldehyde dehydrogenase. In the second assay, the activity of MSAD was monitored by following the depletion of NADH at 340 nm in a coupled assay using the β-NADH-dependent alcohol dehydrogenase at 22 °C. The assay mixture consisted of 100 mm K2HPO4 buffer, pH 9.0, 0.3 mm β-NADH, and 3. The substrate was generated as described above using varying amounts of 2 (1–20 μl) from a 1 m stock solution made up in 100 mm K2HPO4 buffer (pH 8.5) and CaaD (15 μl from a 16 mg/ml solution in 20 mm Na2HPO4 buffer, pH 7.3). When there is no further decrease in absorbance at 224 nm, a quantity of alcohol dehydrogenase (10 μl from of a 6 mg/ml stock solution made up in 100 mm K2HPO4 buffer, pH 9.1) was added to the assay mixture. The assay was initiated by the addition of a quantity of MSAD (5 μl of a 0.1 mg/ml stock solution in 20 mm Na2HPO4 buffer, pH 7.3) and the decrease in absorbance at 340 nm was followed. The initial rate of NADH consumption is proportional to the concentration of MSAD at all substrate concentrations examined (1–20 mm). In both assays, one unit of enzyme activity is defined as the amount of enzyme required to convert 1 μmol of substrate to product in 1 min. Effect of Metal Ions on the MSAD Activity—The enzyme (1 mg/ml) was incubated for 1 h at 22 °C in 50 mm NaH2PO4 buffer (pH ∼6.5), which was made 5 mm in various metal ions (MgCl2, CaCl2, CoCl2, NiCl2, FeCl2, ZnCl2, CuCl2, and MnCl2). In a separate control experiment, the same concentration of MSAD was incubated without any metal ion under otherwise identical conditions. Subsequently, an aliquot (2 μl) was removed, diluted 500-fold into the assay buffer, and the specific activities were determined using the coupled assay described above. The MSAD activity was measured in the presence of the various metal ions (at 0.2 mm) as well as in the absence of these metal ions. Higher concentrations of some metal ions (CuCl2, NiCl2, and ZnCl2) inhibited the aldehyde dehydrogenase. The FeCl2 was maintained in the reduced state by storing the solution under argon. The enzyme was also dialyzed for 24 h at 4 °C with buffer (10 mm Tris-SO4, pH 8.2 or 20 mm NaH2PO4, pH 7.3) made 5 mm in EDTA. The specific activity was determined using the coupled assay. Sodium Cyanoborohydride Treatment of MSAD in the Presence of Substrate and Product—In these experiments, a solution containing 12.5 μm enzyme (based on a subunit molecular mass of 14,106) in a final volume of 100 μl of 100 mm Na2HPO4 buffer (pH 9.0) and 25 mm NaCNBH3 was placed on ice. Subsequently, 3 or 4 was added to a final concentration of 1 mm, and the mixture was allowed to react for 4 h. A stock solution of 3 (10 mm) was generated in situ by the action of CaaD on 2 and the 100 mm stock solution of 4 was made up by the addition of the appropriate amount of 4 to water. The reaction was quenched by the addition of 1 ml of ice-cold 10 mm Tris-SO4 buffer (pH 8.2), which reacts with the remaining 3 or 4. The resulting imine is reduced by the NaCNBH3. In order to remove these products and the excess NaCNBH3, and to establish the irreversibility of the reaction, the reaction mixtures were dialyzed for 24 h with 20 mm Na2HPO4 buffer (pH 9.0). The dialyzed enzymes were assayed for residual activity using the coupled assay. The samples treated with 3 or 4 in the presence of NaCNBH3 did not regain activity. Control reactions containing enzyme, buffer, and substrate, or enzyme, buffer, and NaCNBH3 were carried out under identical conditions. In addition, two structurally similar ketones and one aldehyde (acetopyruvate, acetoacetate, and succinate semialdehyde) were incubated with MSAD under similar conditions. These mixtures did not lead to inactivation of MSAD. Mass Spectral Analysis of the Modified MSAD and Peptide Mapping—Three samples were made up as follows. A quantity of MSAD (20 μl from a 9 mg/ml solution resulting in 180 μg) and a sufficient volume of 100 mm Na2HPO4 buffer (pH ∼9) containing 25 mm NaCNBH3 were added to an Eppendorf tube to produce a final volume of 1 ml. One sample was treated with 3 (100 μl from a 10 mm solution of 3 generated by the action of CaaD on 2 in 100 mm Na2HPO4 buffer, pH 9.0) and the second sample was treated with 4 (10 μl from a 100 mm solution of 4 dissolved in H2O). A third sample was not treated with either compound and was used as the control sample. The three samples were incubated for ∼4 h at 0 °C. Subsequently, the samples were loaded onto separate PD-10 Sephadex G-25 gel filtration columns, which had previously been equilibrated with 100 mm (NH4)2CO3 buffer (pH 8.0). The proteins were eluted by gravity flow using the same buffer. Fractions (0.5 ml) were analyzed for the presence of protein by UV absorbance at 214 nm. The appropriate fractions containing the purified protein samples were concentrated (∼4-fold) under vacuum, analyzed by ESI-MS"
https://openalex.org/W1964227936,"In a previous study, we showed that the RNA-binding domain of human RNase H1 is responsible for the positional preference for cleavage exhibited by the enzyme (Wu, H., Lima, W. F., and Crooke, S. T. (2001) J. Biol. Chem. 276, 23547–23553). Here, we identify the substituents on the heteroduplex substrate and the amino acid residues within the RNA-binding domain of human RNase H1 involved in positioning of the enzyme. The human RNase H1 cleavage patterns observed for heteroduplexes with various 3′-DNA/5′-RNA and 5′-DNA/3′-RNA termini indicate that the 5′-most cleavage site on the oligoribonucleotide is positioned 7 bp from the first 3′-DNA/5′-RNA base pair. The presence or absence of phosphate or hydroxyl groups at either the 3′-DNA or 5′-RNA terminus had no effect on the human RNase H1 cleavage pattern. Substitution of the 3′-deoxynucleotide with a ribonucleotide, 2′-methoxyethyl nucleotide, or mismatched deoxyribonucleotide resulted in the ablation of the 5′-most cleavage site on the oligoribonucleotide. Mutants in which Trp43 and Lys59-Lys60 of the RNA-binding domain were substituted with alanine showed a loss of the positional preference for cleavage. Comparison of the kcat, Km, and Kd for the alanine-substituted mutants with those for human RNase H1 suggests that Lys59 and Lys60 are involved in binding to the heteroduplex and that Trp43 is responsible for properly positioning the enzyme on the substrate for catalysis. These data suggest that Trp43, Lys59, and Lys60 constitute an extended nucleic binding surface for the RNA-binding domain of human RNase H1, with the entire interaction taking place at the 3′-DNA/5′-RNA pole of the heteroduplex. These results offer further insights into the interaction between human RNase H1 and the heteroduplex substrate as well as approaches to enhance the design of effective antisense oligonucleotides.

Although RNases H constitute a family of proteins of varying molecular mass, the nucleolytic activity and substrate requirements appear to be similar for the various isotypes. For example, all RNases H studied to date function as endonucleases exhibiting limited sequence specificity and requiring divalent cations (e.g. Mg2+ and Mn2+) to produce cleavage products with 5′-phosphate and 3′-hydroxyl termini (8.Crouch R.J. Dirksen M.L. Linn S.M. Roberts R.J. Nucleases. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Plainview, NY1982: 211-241Google Scholar). Recently, two human RNase H genes have been cloned and expressed (9.Wu H. Lima W.F. Crooke S.T. Antisense Nucleic Acid Drug Dev. 1998; 8: 53-61Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar, 10.Frank P.

The amino acid sequence of human RNase H1 displays strong homology to RNase H1 from yeast, chicken, Escherichia coli, and mouse (9.Wu H. Lima W.F. Crooke S.T. Antisense Nucleic Acid Drug Dev. 1998; 8: 53-61Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). The human RNase H2 enzyme is a 299-amino acid protein with a calculated mass of 33.4 kDa and has also been shown to be ubiquitously expressed in human cells and tissues (10.Frank P.

Human RNase H2 shares strong amino acid sequence homology with RNase H2 from Caenorhabditis elegans, yeast, and E. coli (10.Frank P. Braunshofer-Reiter C. Wintersberger U. Grimm R. Busen W. Proc.

The structure of human RNase H1 was shown to consist of a 73-amino acid region homologous to the RNA-binding domain of yeast RNase H1 at the amino terminus of the protein and separated from the conserved catalytic domain by a 62-amino acid spacer region (12.Wu H.

Site-directed mutagenesis of human RNase H1 revealed that the spacer region is required for RNase H activity, whereas the RNA-binding domain is not required for RNase H activity, i.e. RNA-binding domain deletion mutants exhibit RNase H activities comparable to those of the wild-type enzyme (12.Wu H. Lima W.F. Crooke S.T. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 23547-23553Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). The RNA-binding domain of human RNase H1 is conserved in other eukaryotic RNases H1 (Fig. 1A) (9.Wu H. Lima W.F. Crooke S.T. Antisense Nucleic Acid Drug Dev. 1998; 8: 53-61Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar, 14.Evans S.P. Bycroft M. J. Mol. Biol. 1999; 291: 661-669Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). The highly conserved lysines at positions 59 and 60 of the human enzyme have been shown in a 46-amino acid peptide of Saccharomyces cerevisiae RNase H1 to be important for binding to the heteroduplex substrate (13.Cerritelli S.M. Crouch R.J. RNA (N. Y.). 1995; 1: 246-259PubMed Google Scholar). The NMR structure of the RNA-binding domain of S. cerevisiae RNase H1 consists of a triple-stranded antiparallel β-sheet sandwiched between two α-helices and shares strong structural similarities with the N-terminal domain of the ribosomal RNA-binding protein L9 (14.Evans S.P. Bycroft M. J. Mol. Biol. 1999; 291: 661-669Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar, 19.Hoffman D.W. Cameron C.S. Davies C. White S.W. Ramakrishnan V. J. Mol. Biol. 1996; 264: 1058-1071Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). The conserved lysine residues are located within the third β-strand. In addition, a highly conserved tryptophan at position 22 was shown to project outwards. A solvent-exposed aromatic amino acid at this position was also observed in the L9 protein and has been shown to be important for binding to 23 S ribosomal RNA (19.Hoffman D.W. Cameron C.S. Davies C. White S.W. Ramakrishnan V. J. Mol. Biol. 1996; 264: 1058-1071Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). The role of the RNA-binding domain of human RNase H1 is not known. Although the RNA-binding domain was shown not to be required for RNase H activity, this region is responsible for the enhanced binding affinity of the human enzyme for the heteroduplex substrate as well as the strong positional preference for cleavage exhibited by the enzyme, i.e. human RNase H1 cleaves the heteroduplex substrate between 7 and 12 nucleotides from the 3′-DNA/5′-RNA terminus (12.Wu H. Lima W.F. Crooke S.T. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 23547-23553Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). The positional preference for cleavage exhibited by the enzyme is consistent with the proposed biological role for RNase H1, viz. the generation and/or removal of RNA primers during lagging-strand DNA replication (20.Cerritelli S.M. Frolova E.G. Feng C. Grinberg A. Love P.E. Crouch R.J. Mol. Cell. 2003; 11: 807-815Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (264) Google Scholar, 21.Busen W. Peters J.H. Hausen P. Eur. J. Biochem. 1977; 74: 203-208Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). The average length of the RNA primers (e.g. 7–14 ribonucleotides) correlates well with the observed cleavage specificity exhibited by human RNase H1 and suggests one possible role for the RNA-binding domain (22.Bambara R.A. Murante R.S. Hendricksen L.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 4647-4650Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (298) Google Scholar). Clearly, understanding how the RNA-binding domain recognizes the 5′-RNA/3′-DNA terminus of the heteroduplex substrate and positions the enzyme to cleave 7–12 nucleotides downstream may provide further insights into the role of the RNA-binding domain with respect to RNase H1 activity, the proposed biological role for the enzyme, and the design of antisense oligonucleotides. In this study we prepared heteroduplex substrates with various 3′-DNA/5′-RNA and 5′-DNA/3′-RNA termini as well as modified 3′-DNA/5′-RNA termini to identify the substituents on the substrate important for positioning of human RNase H1. In addition, mutants of the highly conserved Trp43, Lys59, and Lys60 residues of the RNA-binding domain of human RNase H1 were substituted with alanine to determine the role of these amino acids with respect to the positional preference for cleavage exhibited by the enzyme. Construction of Human RNase H1 Mutants—The mutagenesis of human RNase H1 was performed using a PCR-based technique derived from Landt et al. (23.Landt O. Grunert H. Hahn U. Gene (Amst.). 1990; 96: 125-128Crossref PubMed Scopus (639) Google Scholar). Briefly, two separate PCRs were performed using a set of site-directed mutagenic primers and two vector-specific primers (24.Lima W.F. Wu H. Crooke S.T. Methods Enzymol. 2001; 341: 430-439Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). For the RNase H1(W43A) mutant, the 5′-oligodeoxynucleotide used for PCR was TTCTGACCGCTAATGAGTGCAGAGCAC, and the 3′-oligodeoxynucleotide used was CACTCATTAGCGGTCAGAAAGACCCCG. The PCR primers for the RNase H1(K59A,K60A) mutant were 5′-CCAGATTTGCTGCTTTTGCCACAGAGGATG and 3′-GTGGCAAAAGCAGCAAATCTGGCAGCAGGA. For the RNase H1(W43A,K59A,K60A) mutant, the PCR product from the RNase H1(W43A) mutant was used as a template for a second round of PCR with the primers used for the RNase H1(K59A,K60A) mutant. Two rounds of PCR were performed as previously described (24.Lima W.F. Wu H. Crooke S.T. Methods Enzymol. 2001; 341: 430-439Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). The final PCR product was purified and cloned into the expression vector pET17b (Novagen), resulting in His-tagged fusion proteins (24.Lima W.F. Wu H. Crooke S.T. Methods Enzymol. 2001; 341: 430-439Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). The incorporation of the desired mutations was confirmed by DNA sequencing. Preparation of Human RNase H1 Proteins—The plasmids were transfected into E. coli BL21(DE3) (Novagen). The bacteria were grown in Terrific Broth (Bio 101, Inc.) at 37 °C and harvested at A600 = 1.2. The cells were induced with 1 mm isopropyl-β-d-thiogalactopyranoside at 37 °C for 2 h. The cells were lysed in 6 m guanidine hydrochloride, 100 mm sodium phosphate, and 10 mm Tris (pH 8.0) for 16–20 h at 24 °C. The recombinant proteins were incubated for 1 h with 1 ml of nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid Super Flow beads (QIAGEN Inc.)/50 ml of lysate. The nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid medium was packed into an FPLC 2The abbreviation used is: ! FPLCfast protein liquid chromatography. column, and the RNase H1 proteins were partially purified with sequential gradients (flow rate, 5 ml/min; buffer A, 100 mm sodium phosphate, 10 mm Tris-HCl, and 8 m urea (pH 6.3); buffer B, 100 mm sodium phosphate, 10 mm Tris-HCl, and 2 m urea (pH 6.3); buffer C, 100 mm sodium phosphate, 10 mm Tris-HCl, 2 m urea, and 100 mm EDTA (pH 7.0)). The eluent was further purified by ion exchange FPLC (Mono S column; flow rate, 1 ml/min; buffer A, 20 mm sodium phosphate, 2 m urea, and 200 mm NaCl (pH 7.0); buffer B, 20 mm sodium phosphate, 2 m urea, and 2 m NaCl (pH 7.0)). Fractions containing RNase H1 were pooled and concentrated. The concentrated protein was purified by reverse-phase FPLC (Resource RPC column; flow rate, 1 ml/min; buffer A, 2% acetonitrile in deionized H2O and 0.065% trifluoroacetic acid; buffer B, 80% acetonitrile in deionized H2O and 0.05% trifluoroacetic acid). Fractions were lyophilized, resuspended in deionized H2O, and analyzed by SDS-PAGE (25.Ausubel F.M. Brent R. Kingston R.E. Moore D.D. Smith J.A. Seidman J.G. Struhl K. Current Protocols in Molecular Biology. John Wiley & Sons, Inc., New York1988Google Scholar). fast protein liquid chromatography. Synthesis of Oligonucleotides—The oligoribonucleotides were synthesized on a PE-ABI 380B synthesizer using 5′-O-silyl-2′-O-bis(2-acetoxyethoxy)methyl ribonucleoside phosphoramidites and procedures described elsewhere (26.Scaringe S.A. Wincott F.E. Caruthers M.H. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1998; 120: 11820-11821Crossref Scopus (217) Google Scholar). The oligoribonucleotides were purified by reverse-phase high pressure liquid chromatography. The DNA oligonucleotides were synthesized on a PE-ABI 380B automated DNA synthesizer by standard phosphoramidite chemistry. The DNA oligonucleotides were purified by precipitation twice from 0.5 m NaCl with 2.5 volumes of ethyl alcohol. The 3′-modified oligonucleotides were synthesized with controlled pore glass (Glen Research Corp., Sterling, VA) containing either the 3′-deoxynucleotide or 2′,3′-dideoxynucleotide. Preparation of 32P-Labeled Substrate—The RNA substrate was 5′-end-labeled with 32P using 20 units of T4 polynucleotide kinase (Promega), 120 pmol of [γ-32P]ATP (7000 Ci/mmol; ICN), 40 pmol of RNA, 70 mm Tris (pH 7.6), 10 mm MgCl2, and 50 mm dithiothreitol. The kinase reaction was incubated at 37 °C for 30 min. The labeled oligoribonucleotide was purified by electrophoresis on a 12% denaturing polyacrylamide gel (27.Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. 2nd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar). The specific activity of the labeled oligonucleotide is ∼3000–8000 cpm/fmol. Preparation of the Heteroduplex—The heteroduplex substrate was prepared in 100 μl containing unlabeled oligoribonucleotide ranging from 100 to 1000 nm, 105 cpm 32P-labeled oligoribonucleotide, 2-fold excess complementary oligodeoxyribonucleotide, and hybridization buffer (20 mm Tris (pH 7.5) and 20 mm KCl). Reactions were heated at 90 °C for 5 min and cooled to 37 °C, and 60 units of Prime RNase inhibitor (5 Prime → 3 Prime, Inc., Boulder, CO) and MgCl2 at a final concentration of 1 mm were added. Hybridization reactions were incubated for 2–16 h at 37 °C, and 1 mm tris(2-carboxyethyl)phosphine was added. Multiple-turnover Kinetics—The human RNase H1 proteins were incubated with dilution buffer (50 mm Tris, 50 mm NaCl, and 100 μm tris(2-carboxyethyl)phosphine (pH 7.5)) for 1 h at 24 °C. The heteroduplex substrate was digested with 0.4 ng of enzyme at 37 °C. A 10-μl aliquot of the cleavage reaction was removed at time points ranging from 2 to 120 min and quenched by adding 5 μl of stop solution (8 m urea and 120 mm EDTA). The aliquots were heated at 90 °C for 2 min and resolved on a 12% denaturing polyacrylamide gel, and the substrate and product bands were quantitated on a Amersham Biosciences PhosphorImager. The concentration of the converted product was plotted as a function of time. The initial cleavage rate was obtained from the slope (moles of RNA cleaved per min) of the best fit line for the linear portion of the plot, which comprises, in general, <10% of the total reaction and data from at least five time points. The initial cleavage rates were plotted as a function of the substrate concentration (n ≥ 4), and the data were fit to the Michaelis-Menten equation using the program Ultrafit (Biosoft). The Km corresponds to the heteroduplex substrate concentration at half-maximum rate, and kcat = Vmax/[total RNase H1], where Vmax corresponds to the horizontal asymptote of the hyperbolic curve. Single-turnover Experiments—Reactions were prepared and analyzed as described for the multiple-turnover kinetics with the exception that 50 nm RNA and excess human RNase H1 proteins ranging in concentration from 250 to 500 nm were used. The percent RNA cleaved for each site corresponds to the fraction of converted product for each site multiplied by 100. Determination of Dissociation Constants (Kd)—Binding affinities were determined by inhibition analysis (28.Lima W.F. Crooke S.T. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 390-398Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar). Here, the cleavage rate was determined for the heteroduplex substrate at a variety of concentrations in both the presence and absence of a competing non-cleavable substrate analog. The heteroduplex substrate was prepared as described above, except in a final volume of 50 μl and with equimolar oligoribonucleotide and oligodeoxyribonucleotide ranging in concentration from 100 to 500 nm. The competing non-cleavable substrate analog was prepared in 50 μl of hybridization buffer containing equimolar oligodeoxyribonucleotide and complementary 2′-fluoro-modified oligonucleotide. The concentration of the non-cleavable substrate analog was in excess of the heteroduplex substrate and ranged from 0.5 to 1 μm. Reactions were heated at 90 °C for 5 min and cooled to 37 °C. Prime RNase inhibitor and MgCl2 were added to the reactions as described above. Reactions were incubated at 37 °C for 2–16 h, and the noncleavable substrate analog was added to the heteroduplex substrate. Tris(2-carboxyethyl)phosphine was added at a final concentration of 100 μm, and the combined reaction was digested with 0.4 ng of human RNase H1 proteins. The reactions were quenched, analyzed, and quantitated as described for multiple-turnover kinetics. The human RNase H1 site-specific cleavage rates for the heteroduplexes containing a 25-mer oligoribonucleotide and complementary oligodeoxyribonucleotides ranging in length from 19 to 26 nucleotides are shown in Fig. 2. These heteroduplexes contained single-strand RNA overhangs at either the 3′ terminus (Fig. 2A) or 5′ terminus (Fig. 2B). Consistent with previous observations (29.Wu H. Lima W.L. Crooke S.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 28270-28278Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar), the predominant human RNase H1 site-specific cleavages were observed between 7 and 10 nucleotides from the 5′ terminus of the oligoribonucleotide (Fig. 2). Varying the length of the heteroduplex by shortening the 5′ terminus of the oligodeoxyribonucleotide and effectively increasing the length of the 3′-RNA overhang had no effect on the either the positions or rates of the site-specific cleavages (Fig. 2A). In contrast, shortening the length of the heteroduplex from the 3′ terminus of the oligodeoxyribonucleotide affected both the positions and rates of the site-specific cleavages (Fig. 2B). For example, removing a nucleotide at the 3′ terminus of the oligodeoxyribonucleotide resulted in the ablation of the 5′-sitespecific cleavage on the oligoribonucleotide and a 3′-shift in the cleavage pattern. The elimination of additional terminal 3′-nucleotides from the oligodeoxyribonucleotide resulted in similar 3′-shifts in the cleavage pattern. As a result, a fixed distance of 7 bp was observed between the 5′-RNA/3′-DNA terminus and the 5′-site-specific cleavage. Heteroduplexes in which the 3′-DNA/5′-RNA termini contained either a phosphate or hydroxyl group on either the oligodeoxyribonucleotide or oligoribonucleotide exhibited similar cleavage patterns (Fig. 3, substrates A–E). Substitution of the terminal 3′-nucleotide of the oligodeoxyribonucleotide with either a ribonucleotide or 2′-methoxyethyl-modified nucleotide resulted in the ablation of the 5′-site-specific cleavage on the oligoribonucleotide (Fig. 3, substrates F–I). A mismatch at the 3′-DNA/5′-RNA terminus also resulted in the loss of the 5′-site-specific cleavage on the oligoribonucleotide (Fig. 3, substrate J). These data suggest that the 5′-site-specific cleavage by human RNase H1 is determined by the first deoxyribonucleotide/ribonucleotide base pair on the 3′-DNA/5′-RNA terminus of the heteroduplex. Furthermore, these data show that the enzyme recognizes a DNA/RNA base pair as different from an RNA/RNA or 2′-modified nucleotide/RNA base pair and that neither phosphate nor hydroxyl groups at the 3′-DNA/5′-RNA terminus are used to position the enzyme. To identify the amino acids responsible for the strong positional preference for cleavage exhibited by human RNase H1, three mutants were prepared in which alanine was substituted for the conserved lysine residues at positions 59 and 60 (RNase H1(K59A,K60A)), the conserved tryptophan at position 43 (RNase H1(W43A)), and all three conserved amino acids (RNase H1(W43A,K59A,K60A)) (Fig. 1B). The cleavage patterns for the wild-type enzyme as well as the three RNase H1 mutants were determined by measuring the percent RNA cleaved for each position on the heteroduplex. To ensure that the observed cleavage pattern was the result of primary cleavages, the assay was performed under single-turnover kinetics with the enzyme concentration in excess of the substrate concentration. The positions of the cleavage sites for wild-type human RNase H1 under single-turnover kinetics were consistent with the positions of the cleavage sites observed for the wild-type enzyme under multiple-turnover kinetics (Fig. 4). Furthermore, as would be expected, the positional preference for cleavage was more pronounced under single-turnover kinetics (e.g. the majority of RNase H1 cleavages occurred within 7–8 nucleotides from the 5′ terminus of the RNA). All three human RNase H1 mutants exhibited broader cleavage patterns than the wild-type human enzyme (Fig. 4). The RNase H1(W43A,K59A,K60A) mutant (Fig. 4d) exhibited the broadest cleavage pattern, with cleavage sites ranging from 6 to 16 nucleotides from the 5′ terminus of the oligoribonucleotide. In fact, the RNase H1(W43A,K59A,K60A) mutant did not appear to exhibit a positional preference for cleavage (e.g. the cleavage rates at 15 and 17 nucleotides from the 5′ terminus of the oligoribonucleotide were comparable to the cleavage rates at the preferred sites 7–9 nucleotides from the 5′ terminus of the oligoribonucleotide). Thus, its behavior is comparable to the behavior of a human RNase H1 mutant in which the RNA-binding domain is deleted (12.Wu H. Lima W.F. Crooke S.T. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 23547-23553Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). The kinetic constants for wild-type and mutant human RNase H1 enzymes are shown in Table I. Both the RNase H1(K59A,K60A) and RNase H1(W43A,K59A,K60A) mutants exhibited Km values 2-fold higher than the Km for human RNase H1. Comparable increases in the dissociation constants (Kd) for the heteroduplex were observed for the RNase H1(K59A,K60A) and RNase H1(W43A,K59A,K60A) mutants compared with the wild-type enzyme. A modest reduction in the catalytic rate (kcat) was observed for both mutants, resulting in an ∼3-fold reduction in the bimolecular rate constant (kcat/Km) compared with the wild-type enzyme (Table I). Conversely, the RNase H1(W43A) mutant exhibited a significantly lower Km and kcat compared with human RNase H1 (Table I). Finally, the RNase H1(W43A) mutant appeared to bind to the heteroduplex with an affinity comparable to that of the wild-type enzyme (Table I).Table IInitial cleavage rates for wild-type and mutant human RNase H1 proteinsHuman enzymeKmkcatkcat/KmKdnmmin-1m-1 min-1nmRNase H1601 ± 421.46 ± 0.05(2.4 ± 0.04) × 106665 ± 13RNase H1 (K59 A, R60A)1264 ± 881.00 ± 0.08(7.9 ± 0.6) × 1051121 ± 136RNase H1 (W43A)129 ± 40.04 ± 0.001(3.0 ± 0.2) × 105412 ± 67RNase H1 (W43A, K59A, K60A)1084 ± 961.19 ± 0.11(8.8 ± 0.1) × 1051556 ± 119 Open table in a new tab Human RNase H1 has been shown to exhibit a strong positional preference for cleavage in comparison with E. coli RNase H1 (29.Wu H. Lima W.L. Crooke S.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 28270-28278Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar). The human enzyme predominately cleaved the heteroduplex substrate 7–10 nucleotides from the 5′-RNA/3′-DNA terminus, whereas E. coli RNase H1 exhibits a broader cleavage pattern. The RNA-binding domain of human RNase H1 was shown to be responsible for the positional preference for cleavage exhibited by the human enzyme, as deletion of this domain resulted in an E. coli RNase H1 cleavage pattern (12.Wu H. Lima W.F. Crooke S.T. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 23547-23553Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). These data also suggest that, based on the positional preference for cleavage exhibited by the human enzyme, the RNA-binding domain likely interacts with the 3′-DNA/5′-RNA terminus of the heteroduplex. Consistent with these observations, we have shown, under multiple-turnover kinetics, that human RNase H1 exhibited a similar positional preference for cleavage for a variety of heteroduplex sequences (Fig. 2). The positions of the 3′-DNA/5′-RNA and 5′-DNA/3′-RNA termini were varied on a 25-nucleotide oligoribonucleotide by truncating the 3′ or 5′ terminus, respectively, of the complementary oligodeoxyribonucleotide. The resulting heteroduplexes ranged in length from 19 to 25 nucleotides and contained either 3′- or 5′-RNA overhangs. In addition, a 26-mer oligodeoxyribonucleotide was used to generate a 25-mer heteroduplex with a single 3′-deoxynucleotide overhang (Fig. 2B). The human RNase H1 cleavage patterns observed for these heteroduplexes indicate that the 5′-site-specific cleavage on the oligoribonucleotide is positioned 7 bp from the first 3′-DNA/5′-RNA base pair. The position of the 5′-DNA/3′-RNA terminus appeared to have no affect on the positional preference for cleavage, as the fixed 7-bp distance from the 3′-DNA/5′-RNA terminus to the 5′-site-specific cleavage was maintained. The presence of 5′-RNA overhangs had no effect on the position of the 5′-site-specific cleavage. In contrast, a single 3′-DNA overhang appeared to result in an additional 5′-cleavage site, although the initial rate for this site was slow relative to the rates observed for other cleavage sites within this heteroduplex. Under single-turnover kinetics, a pronounced positional preference for cleavage was observed (Fig. 4). The single-turnover reactions were performed with the enzyme in excess of the heteroduplex and therefore measured a single interaction between"

Under conditions in which pre-RCs are formed, both ORC and CDC6 dissociate from sperm chromatin with a relatively fast t½ of 15 min. ORC dissociation from chromatin is regulated through the recruitment of CDC6 and MCM proteins as well as ATP hydrolysis. The t½ for ORC alone in the absence of Cdc6 is 40 min and increases 8-fold to >2 h when Cdc6 is present. Strikingly, the presence of a non-hydrolyzable ATP derivative, ATPγS, not only increases both ORC and CDC6 t½ but also inhibits the loading of MCM. The very stable association of ORC and Cdc6 with chromatin in this sequence-independent replication system suggests that origin selection in metazoans cannot be strictly dependent on the interaction of ORCs with specific DNA binding sequences. Using a plasmid competition assay, we have measured the stability of origin recognition complex (ORC) associated with sperm chromatin under physiological conditions. Under conditions in which pre-RCs are formed, both ORC and CDC6 dissociate from sperm chromatin with a relatively fast t½ of 15 min. ORC dissociation from chromatin is regulated through the recruitment of CDC6 and MCM proteins as well as ATP hydrolysis. The t½ for ORC alone in the absence of Cdc6 is 40 min and increases 8-fold to >2 h when Cdc6 is present. Strikingly, the presence of a non-hydrolyzable ATP derivative, ATPγS, not only increases both ORC and CDC6 t½ but also inhibits the loading of MCM. The very stable association of ORC and Cdc6 with chromatin in this sequence-independent replication system suggests that origin selection in metazoans cannot be strictly dependent on the interaction of ORCs with specific DNA binding sequences. Initiation of replication in eukaryotes can be divided into two major steps. The first step involves the establishment of a pre-replication complex (pre-RC) 1The abbreviations used are: pre-RCpre-replication complexNPEnucleoplasmic extractELBegg lysis bufferORCorigin recognition complexATPγSadenosine 5′-3-O-(thio)triphosphateARSautonomous replication sequence.1The abbreviations used are: pre-RCpre-replication complexNPEnucleoplasmic extractELBegg lysis bufferORCorigin recognition complexATPγSadenosine 5′-3-O-(thio)triphosphateARSautonomous replication sequence. on chromatin (1.Bell S.P. Dutta A. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2002; 71: 333-374Crossref PubMed Scopus (1388) Google Scholar). Pre-RCs assemble during G1 phase of the cell cycle through the sequential binding of the replication proteins ORC, Cdc6, and MCM to multiple sites along the chromosome (2.Romanowski P.

In the second step, chromatin is converted to a state of active replication. This conversion occurs at the G1 to S transition, concurrent with the activation of Cdk2 and Cdc7 kinases (1.Bell S.P. Dutta A. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2002; 71: 333-374Crossref PubMed Scopus (1388) Google Scholar, 6.Stillman B. Science. 1996; 274: 1659-1664Crossref PubMed Scopus (428) Google Scholar). The activation of these kinases allows the loading of Cdc45, polymerase α, and RPA and the single-stranded binding protein (7.Walter J. Newport J. Mol. Cell. 2000; 5: 617-627Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (319) Google Scholar) as well as suppresses the assembly of pre-RCs by inhibition of MCM loading (8.Hua X.H. Yan H. Newport J. J. Cell Biol. 1997; 137: 183-192Crossref PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar). Thus, pre-RCs are only assembled during a defined window of the cell cycle.In the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae, the high affinity of ORC for specific DNA sequences (ARS sequences) (9.Bell S.P. Stillman B. Nature. 1992; 357: 128-134Crossref PubMed Scopus (988) Google Scholar) directs pre-RCs to form at particular sites along the genome (10.Wyrick J.J. Aparicio J.G. Chen T. Barnett J.D. Jennings E.G. Young R.A. Bell S.P. Aparicio O.M. Science. 2001; 294: 2357-2360Crossref PubMed Scopus (333) Google Scholar). The ORC hexameric complex consists of six related subunits, all of which are required for viability (1.Bell S.P. Dutta A. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2002; 71: 333-374Crossref PubMed Scopus (1388) Google Scholar). ORC binding to the ARS protects approximately 50 bp of DNA, and ORC subunits 1, 2, and 4 make specific contacts within the 11-bp ARS consensus sequence (11.Lee D.G. Bell S.P. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 7159-7168Crossref PubMed Scopus (166) Google Scholar). Binding to ARS inhibits the intrinsic ATPase activity of ORC1p. Although mutations in this subunit do not block the binding of ORC to DNA, they do abrogate the loading of Cdc6 (12.Klemm R.D. Bell S.P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 8361-8367Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). Although ORC and all of the other protein components involved in pre-RC formation are conserved between yeast and metazoans, metazoan equivalents of ARS sequences have yet to be found. Moreover, in metazoans, the number of pre-RCs that form appears to be under developmental control. For example, during early embryonic divisions in both Drosophila melanogaster and Xenopus laevis, pre-RCs form every 3 and 10 kb, respectfully, and pre-RC formation is DNA sequence-independent (13.Hyrien O. Méchali M. EMBO J. 1993; 12: 4511-4520Crossref PubMed Scopus (170) Google Scholar, 14.Hyrien O. Maric C. Méchali M. Science. 1995; 270: 994-997Crossref PubMed Scopus (271) Google Scholar, 15.Sasaki T. Sawado T. Yamaguchi M. Shinomiya T. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 547-555Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). As development proceeds, pre-RC formation gradually decreases as replicon size increases to 100–200 kb in somatic cells (14.Hyrien O. Maric C. Méchali M. Science. 1995; 270: 994-997Crossref PubMed Scopus (271) Google Scholar, 15.Sasaki T. Sawado T. Yamaguchi M. Shinomiya T. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 547-555Crossref PubMed Google Scholar).At present, it is not known whether this change occurs as a result of post-translational modification of ORC, expression of new proteins that restrict where ORC can bind, or developmental modifications of the chromatin template that limit ORC binding (1.Bell S.P. Dutta A. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2002; 71: 333-374Crossref PubMed Scopus (1388) Google Scholar). The composition of the embryonic and somatic ORC appears to be identical (16.Tugal T. Zou-Yang X.H. Gavin K. Pappin D. Canas B. Kobayashi R. Hunt T. Stillman B. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 32421-32429Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar), suggesting that the decrease in pre-RC formation in somatic cells relative to early embryonic cells may largely be the result of developmental changes in the chromatin template.The ability of Xenopus extracts to replicate DNA from any source provides an opportunity for carrying out detailed biochemical experiments designed to elucidate the kinetic parameters and mechanisms that limit and regulate the formation of pre-RCs in metazoans (17.Walter J. Newport J.W. Science. 1997; 275: 993-995Crossref PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar, 18.Rowles A. Tada S. Blow J.J. J. Cell Sci. 1999; 112: 2011-2018Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 19.Blow J.J.

Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 33049-33057Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (213) Google Scholar). Using this physiological system, we have measured the dissociation rate of ORC from chromatin at different stages of pre-RC assembly. Our results suggest that ORC by itself dissociates from nonspecific chromatin sequences with a t½ of 40 min and that ATP hydrolysis may play a critical role in timing how long ORC remains bound to DNA. We find that Cdc6 significantly stabilizes the association of ORC with chromatin increasing the t½ from 40 to 170 min. Following the loading of the MCM helicase into the pre-RC, the affinity of both ORC and Cdc6 for chromatin decreases significantly and ORC dissociates from chromatin with a t½ of 15 min. These findings suggest that ORC and Cdc6 may function in a catalytic manner, loading MCM onto DNA and then dissociating from the DNA to serve the same function at other locations. Furthermore, in the absence of ancillary factors or developmentally regulated chromatin modifications, the tight association of metazoan ORC with nonspecific sequences suggests that during a typical G1 period, it would be kinetically impossible for ORC to locate and bind to specific sites in the presence of the overwhelming number of tight binding nonspecific competitor sites present in the genome.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESSperm and Extract Preparation—Demembranated sperm were prepared as described previously (21.Smythe C. Newport J.W. Methods Cell Biol. 1991; 35: 449-468Crossref PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar). Membrane free egg cytosol and nucleoplasmic extract (NPE) were prepared as described previously (21.Smythe C. Newport J.W. Methods Cell Biol. 1991; 35: 449-468Crossref PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar, 22.Walter J. Sun L. Newport J. Mol. Cell. 1998; 1: 519-529Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (217) Google Scholar).Immunodepletion—ORC, Cdc6, and MCM were depleted from 100 μl of egg cytosol by the addition of 15, 50, or 100 μl, respectively, of high titer affinity-purified α-XORC2, α-XCdc6, or α-MCM7. Immunocomplexes were cleared three times with protein A-agarose (BD Biosciences) as previously described (7.Walter J. Newport J. Mol. Cell. 2000; 5: 617-627Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (319) Google Scholar). For all of the proteins, monospecific sera were used for the depletion and preimmune sera were used for mock-depletion controls. α-XORC2, α-XCdc6, and α-MCM3 sera were used as described previously (17.Walter J. Newport J.W. Science. 1997; 275: 993-995Crossref PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar, 23.Hua X.H. Newport J. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 140: 271-281Crossref PubMed Scopus (190) Google Scholar). Because α-MCM3 only reacts with denatured MCM (data not shown), MCM7 antiserum was used for depletion. MCM7 antiserum was raised against a bacterially expressed C-terminal fragment of MCM7 (amino acids 545–720) that was purified using nickel-affinity chromatography. The antiserum specifically recognized a protein of a molecular mass of ∼100 kDa and depleted the complete MCM complex (data not shown). In all of the cases, the extent of depletion was monitored by Western blotting and found to be at least 99%.Chromatin Binding Assay—15,000 demembranated sperm nuclei were incubated with 7.5 μl of membrane free egg cytosol supplemented with nocodazole and an ATP regeneration system (20 mm phosphocreatine, 5 μg/ml creatine kinase, and 0.2 mm ATP) for 30 min at room temperature. Samples were diluted in 45 μl of egg lysis buffer (ELB, 2.5 mm MgCl, 50 mm KCl, 10 mm Hepes, pH 7.7) + 2 mm ATP. Chromatin was isolated by spinning the diluted sample through 100 μl of ELB with 0.5 m sucrose for 15 s at 16,000 × g at 4 °C. All but ∼3 μl of supernatant were aspirated, and the remaining sample was boiled in 10 μl of SDS loading buffer.DNA Replication Assays—DNA replication in NPE was measured as described previously (22.Walter J. Sun L. Newport J. Mol. Cell. 1998; 1: 519-529Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (217) Google Scholar). Sperm chromatin was incubated in 10 μl of extract for 30 min, and then 25 μl of NPE was added. [α-32P]dATP was included in all of the replication assays at a concentration of 0.1 μCi/μl egg. Reaction products were visualized after running on 1% agarose gel that was then dried and exposed to a phosphorimaging screen (Amersham Biosciences).Determination of ORC t½—Standard chromatin binding assays were performed as described above. After the initial 30-min incubation of sperm chromatin in egg cytosol, 1 μg of supercoiled pBluescriptII SK(–) was added to the binding reaction with 45 μl of ELB + 2 mm ATP or 0.5 mm ATPγS. During the initial 30-min binding reaction, ATPγS was included in the ATP regeneration system where appropriate. t½ was determined by measuring the amount of ORC associated with chromatin as a function of time as assessed by Western blot analysis. The rate of dissociation was assumed to be the slope of the line generated by plotting the amount of ORC bound as a function of time using FigP software (Biosoft, Cambridge, United Kingdom). For each experiment, binding assays were quantified using a standard curve of bacterially expressed purified XORC2-His. Proteins were visualized by chemiluminescence (Pierce). All of the measurements were performed at least three times with consistent results, and the t½ represent results of one complete experiment. Western blot analysis was performed using primary antibodies described above and goat anti-rabbit IgG-horseradish proxidase (Jackson, West Grove, PA). All of the incubations were performed at 1:5000 dilutions. Western blot analysis was linear over 2 orders of magnitude as determined using purified XOR2-His.RESULTSPlasmid Competes for Pre-assembled ORC and Cdc6 but Not MCM—To characterize the interaction between Xenopus pre-RC proteins and chromatin, an off-rate assay was developed. Membrane free Xenopus egg cytosol mimics the G1 phase of the cell cycle (22.Walter J. Sun L. Newport J. Mol. Cell. 1998; 1: 519-529Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (217) Google Scholar). In these cytosolic extracts, ORC, Cdc6, and MCM form mature pre-RCs within 30 min after the addition of either sperm chromatin or plasmid DNA templates and these pre-RCs remain stable for at least 2 h (data not shown) (5.Maiorano D. Moreau J. Méchali M. Nature. 2000; 404: 622-625Crossref PubMed Scopus (292) Google Scholar, 17.Walter J. Newport J.W. Science. 1997; 275: 993-995Crossref PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar). To establish the t½ of ORC from pre-RCs, sperm chromatin was first incubated for 30 min in extract to allow pre-RCs to assemble and then a large excess of a 3-kb competitor plasmid DNA was added to the extract to trap both excess ORC present in the extract and ORC that dissociated from existing pre-RCs. At different times after the addition of the competitor plasmid DNA, brief centrifugation was used to separate the sperm chromatin from both the extract and the competitor DNA. Following this procedure, the amount of ORC2 remaining bound to the sperm was quantified by Western blot analysis. ORC2 is used as an indicator of the presence of the complete hexameric ORC complex.Using this approach, we found that excess plasmid efficiently competes for pre-assembled ORC in a dose- and time-dependent manner (Fig. 1, A and B). Plasmid also competes for preassembled Cdc6 (see Fig. 4C). Importantly, the plasmid does not compete for the pre-assembled MCM hexamer (Figs. 1A, and 4, A and C). This is consistent with data showing that after pre-RC assembly, both ORC and Cdc6 bind chromatin less tightly than MCM based on differential extraction of these proteins with high salt (18.Rowles A. Tada S. Blow J.J. J. Cell Sci. 1999; 112: 2011-2018Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Chromatin remains competent for replication after the removal of ORC and Cdc6 by plasmid competition (Fig. 1C). This is consistent with the finding that ORC and Cdc6 are not required for initiation once MCM is loaded onto DNA (18.Rowles A. Tada S. Blow J.J. J. Cell Sci. 1999; 112: 2011-2018Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 23.Hua X.H. Newport J. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 140: 271-281Crossref PubMed Scopus (190) Google Scholar).Fig. 4MCM loading increases t½ of ORC from chromatin.A, levels of sperm chromatin-associated ORC2 and MCM3 were determined by Western blot analysis after incubation in mock-depleted cytosol for 30 min followed by the addition of 1 μg of supercoiled plasmid DNA for increasing amounts of time. B, t½ was calculated as in Fig. 2. C, sperm-associated ORC2, CDC6, and MCM3 were determined after incubation in mock-depleted cytosol for 30 min either in the presence or absence of ATPγS followed by the addition of 1 μg of supercoiled plasmid DNA for 60 min.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)In Egg Cytosol ORC Exhibits a Stable t½ from Chromatin— Using the competition assay described above, we measured the t½ of ORC by itself from sperm chromatin. To do this, Cdc6 was immunodepleted from the extract (Fig. 2A). Because ORC, Cdc6, and MCM are assembled into pre-RCs sequentially, depletion of Cdc6 from extracts blocks the binding of both Cdc6 and MCM (3.Coleman T.R. Carpenter P.B. Dunphy W.G. Cell. 1996; 87: 53-63Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (328) Google Scholar). Therefore, under these conditions, the t½ of chromatin-bound ORC by itself can be determined from a competition assay. The percent of ORC remaining bound to chromatin at different times after the addition of excess competitor to the extract was measured by quantitative Western blot analysis using known quantities of purified XORC-His as a standard (Fig. 2B). The dissociation rate or t½ of ORC bound to sperm chromatin was determined from the slope of a plot of percent ORC bound versus time. Unexpectedly, the interaction of ORCs with chromatin under these conditions was extremely stable with a t½ of 40 min (Fig. 2C). This observation suggests that the binding of metazoan ORC to nonspecific DNA sequences, unlike S. cerevisiae ORC, is very tight and very stable (24.Klemm R.D. Austin R.J. Bell S.P. Cell. 1997; 88: 493-502Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (206) Google Scholar, 25.Mizushima T. Takahashi N. Stillman B. Genes Dev. 2000; 14: 1631-1641PubMed Google Scholar).Fig. 2ATP hydrolysis regulates the t½ of ORC in the absence of CDC6.A, extracts were immunodepleted of Cdc6 and subjected to Western blot analysis using a Cdc6-specific antibody. The IgG signal is from residual antibody carried over from the depletion. B, levels of sperm chromatin-associated ORC2 and MCM3 were determined by Western blot analysis after incubation in Cdc6-negative cytosol for 30 min either in the presence or absence of ATPγS followed by the addition of 1 μg of supercoiled plasmid DNA for increasing amounts of time. C, the Western blot from B was quantified by densitometry and normalized to the amount of ORC signal in the absence of competitor DNA. The data were plotted using FigP software, and t½ was calculated as the time at which 50% ORC is bound to chromatin.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)ORC has been characterized as an ATP-binding protein complex and contains hydrolytic activity associated with the ORC1p subunit (12.Klemm R.D. Bell S.P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 8361-8367Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar, 24.Klemm R.D. Austin R.J. Bell S.P.

EMBO J. 2000; 19: 4774-4782Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). ATP binding is required for specific association with origins in yeast, but ATP hydrolysis is not. In fact, in yeast the rate of ATP hydrolysis is inhibited by the binding of ORC to origins (12.Klemm R.D. Bell S.P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 8361-8367Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar, 24.Klemm R.D. Austin R.J. Bell S.P.

EMBO J. 2000; 19: 4774-4782Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). Using extracts immunodepleted of Cdc6, we observe that the addition of non-hydrolyzable ATP (ATPγS) in the competition assay has an appreciable affect on the t½ of ORC bound to chromatin, increasing it from 40 to 169 min, a greater than 4-fold increase in the t½ (Fig. 2, B and C). Thus ATP hydrolysis, possibly via ORC itself, may regulate the interaction of ORCs with chromatin. The affect of ATPγS is not simply due to the inhibition of activities that may be required for activation of the chromatin template. Chromatin decondensation takes place normally in these extracts. Moreover, the addition of ATPγS to reactions in which chromatin is first assembled in cytosol depleted of ORC results in a similar t½ upon the addition of undepleted extract containing ORC (data not shown).Cdc6 Stabilizes ORC Binding of Origins—To determine the influence of Cdc6 on the t½ of ORC, we allowed pre-RCs to progress to an intermediate step in assembly by immunodepletion of MCM complexes from the cytosolic extract. Depletion of the complete hexameric MCM complex was achieved using an antibody to XMCM7 (Fig. 3A) (27.Romanowski P. Madine M.A. Laskey R.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 10189-10194Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). These extracts remained competent for loading both ORC and Cdc6. In the presence of Cdc6, the t½ of ORC increased from 40 to 128 min (Fig. 3, B and C), a 3-fold increase. This finding suggests that recruitment of Cdc6 confers stability to the ORC/chromatin complex, possibly through the inhibition of the intrinsic ATP hydrolysis activity of ORC. In support of this possibility, non-hydrolyzable ATP does not affect the t½ of the ORC·Cdc6 complex (<2-fold increase) as much it does ORC alone (greater than 4-fold).Fig. 3Cdc6 recruitment decreases t½ of ORC from chromatin.A, extracts were immunodepleted of MCM7 and subjected to Western blot analysis using a MCM7-specific antibody. B, levels of sperm chromatin-associated ORC2 and MCM3 were determined by Western blot analysis after incubation in MCM-negative cytosol for 30 min followed by the addition of 1 μg of supercoiled plasmid DNA for increasing amounts of time. C, t½ was calculated as in Fig. 2.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)MCM Recruitment Allows Release of ORC and Cdc6 in an ATP-dependent Step—In mock-depleted cytosol, mature pre-RCs consisting of ORC, Cdc6, and MCM form. Strikingly, the t½ of ORC from a mature pre-RC is 15 min. This is a 3-fold decrease relative to ORC alone (t½ = 40 min) and an 8.5-fold decrease relative to ORC-Cdc6 (t½ = 128 min) (Fig. 4, A and B). This dramatic change in the t½ suggests that ORC and Cdc6 are destabilized upon MCM loading possibly because of the recruitment of other replication factors or via changes in DNA topology such as the generation of localized single-stranded DNA (26.Lee D.G. Makhov A.M. Klemm R.D. Griffith J.D. Bell S.P. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 4774-4782Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). The switch from a tightly bound complex to a relatively looser protein/DNA complex upon loading of the putative replication helicase suggests that ORC and Cdc6 may function catalytically. That is, once ORC and Cdc6 have loaded MCM onto DNA, they can dissociate from the DNA to load MCM onto other sites during the G1 window of pre-RC assembly.When non-hydrolyzable ATP is added to mock-depleted cytosol, ORC and Cdc6 associate with chromatin but MCM binding is blocked (Fig. 4C). Moreover, under these conditions both ORC and Cdc6 are resistant to competition by plasmid DNA (Fig. 4C). Similar to the ORC1p subunit, Cdc6 contains nucleotide-binding Walker A and B motifs. Mutations in these sites inactivate hydrolytic activity in vitro and abrogate the loading of MCMs onto chromatin (28.Frolova N.S. Schek N. Tikhmyanova N. Coleman T.R. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2002; 13: 1298-1312Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar, 29.Herbig U. Marlar C.A. Fanning E. Mol. Biol.

A. 1999; 96: 441-446Crossref PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar). Thus, dissociation of ORC and Cdc6 may be linked to an ATP hydrolysis step required for the loading of the MCM hexamer (Fig. 5).Fig. 5Summary of t½ of ORC from nonspecific DNA sites during different stages of pre-RC assembly. ORC alone binds to DNA with a t½ of 42 min. The rate of ATP hydrolysis by ORC may control its association with DNA and thus provide regulated scanning of DNA for origin selection. The loading of Cdc6 increases the t½ of ORC to 128 min, locking ORC onto a potential origin. Finally, the loading of MCM helicase, in a step requiring ATP hydrolysis, results in the destabilization of ORC (t½ = 15 min), thus providing ORC and Cdc6 the potential to establish pre-RCs at additional distant origin sites.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)DISCUSSIONUsing a simple competition assay, we have measured the stability of ORC on chromatin under close to physiological conditions. Our results suggest that metazoan ORC binds to nonspecific sequences with very high affinity. After associating with chromatin, ORC remains bound for ∼40 min. The long association time between ORC and nonspecific DNA sequences has important ramifications for models that assume that ORC normally binds and assembles pre-RCs only at specific DNA sequences. That is, for ORC to bind specific sites requires that it sample and bind many nonspecific sites during the course of a search for a specific binding site. Presumably, if the affinity of ORC for nonspecific sites is very weak then it would remain bound for a short time before dissociating. This does not appear to be the case for the metazoan ORC based on the data presented in this report. Rather, a 40-min resident time suggests that ORC could only sample ∼18 sites in a somatic replicon of 100–200 kb during a typical 12-h G1 phase. Clearly, this possibility suggests that if metazoan pre-RCs form at unique sequences then either ancillary factors must exist, which reduce the affinity of somatic ORC for nonspecific DNA sites, or large regions of the cells chromatin must be modified so that these nonspecific sites are no longer accessible to ORC.With respect to ancillary proteins that could function to reduce the affinity of ORC for nonspecific DNA sites, Cdc6 might be an excellent candidate. Indeed, in a recent report (25.Mizushima T. Takahashi N. Stillman B. Genes Dev. 2000; 14: 1631-1641PubMed Google Scholar) using purified ORC and Cdc6 from yeast, it was concluded that Cdc6 reduced the affinity of ORC for nonspecific sites. However, in our studies under more physiological conditions, we find that when Cdc6 is incorporated into the pre-RC, the stable association of ORC with nonspecific sites increases greater than 4-fold, from 40 to 128 min. This disparity may be because of the different assay conditions employed. We have used chromatinized DNA template and crude extracts mimicking in vivo conditions, whereas the yeast study employed purified ORC, Cdc6, and naked 290-bp DNA fragments. It is possible, however, that the results may also be species-dependent. In yeast, ORC clearly binds to well defined sequences, whereas in metazoans, comparable sequences may not exist. As such, Cdc6 in yeast may have adapted an additional function (decreasing the association of ORC with nonspecific sequences) that is absent in the Cdc6 from metazoan organisms.It is also clear from our studies that the very stable association of the metazoan ORC·Cdc6 complex with random DNA sites would make a search for “specific” sites very slow. ORC·Cdc6 would only be able to sample six sites within a 100–200-kb somatic replicon during a typical 12-h G1 phase. Again, this finding suggests that if specific sites exist in metazoans, then yet to be identified ancillary factors must function to inhibit the association of somatic ORC with nonspecific sites. These factors could associate with either ORC or chromatin.With respect to the role of ATP hydrolysis in pre-RC assembly, we observe that the presence of non-hydrolyzable ATP significantly stabilizes the association of ORC with chromatin, increasing its t½ 4-fold to 169 min. Interestingly, previous studies have demonstrated that the ATP hydrolysis rate of purified yeast ORC is reduced ∼7–8-fold when bound to DNA and that in this bound state ORC hydrolyzes approximately 1 ATP/every 30 min (24.Klemm R.D. Austin R.J. Bell S.P. Cell. 1997; 88: 493-502Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (206) Google Scholar). 2S. Bell, personal communication. This is very similar to the time we measured for the t½ of metazoan ORC from chromatin (40 min) and is consistent with the hypothesis that ATP hydrolysis might serve as a timing mechanism regulating the association of ORC with DNA. For example, if bound ATP stabilizes a conformation of ORC that has high affinity for DNA, the duration of this high affinity state (association of ORC with DNA) would be linked to the rate of ATP hydrolysis. Moreover, if Cdc6 served to inhibit"
https://openalex.org/W1986466955,"Platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF) is a potent mitogen for mesenchymal cells. PDGF AA functions as a “competent factor” that stimulates cell cycle entry but requires additional (progression) factors in serum to transit the cell cycle beyond the G1/S checkpoint. Unlike PDGF AA, PDGF B-chain (c-sis) homodimer (PDGF BB) and its viral counterpart v-sis can serve as both competent and progression factors. PDGF BB activates α- and β-receptor subunits (α-PDGFR and β-PDGFR) and induces phenotypic transformation in NIH 3T3 cells, whereas PDGF AA activates α-PDGFR only and fails to induce transformation. We showed previously that α-PDGFR antagonizes β-PDGFR-mediated transformation through activation of stress-activated protein kinase-1/c-Jun NH2-terminal kinase-1, whereas both α-PDGFR and β-PDGFR induce mitogenic signals. These studies revealed a striking feature of PDGF signaling; the specificity and the strength of the PDGF growth signal is modulated by α-PDGFR-mediated simultaneous activation of growth stimulatory and inhibitory signals, whereas β-PDGFR mainly induces a growth-promoting signal. Here we demonstrate that PDGF BB activation of β-PDGFR alone results in more efficient cell cycle transition from G1 to S phase than PDGF BB activation of both α-PDGFR and β-PDGFR. PDGF AA activation of α-PDGFR or PDGF BB activation of both α- and β-PDGFRs up-regulates expression of p21WAF1/CIP1, an inhibitor of cell cycle-dependent kinases and a downstream mediator of the tumor suppressor gene product p53. However, β-PDGFR activation alone fails to induce p21WAF1/CIP1 expression. We also demonstrate that α-PDGFR-activated JNK-1 is a critical signaling component for PDGF induction of p21WAF1/CIP1 promoter activity. The ability of PDGF/JNK-1 to induce p21WAF1/CIP1 promoter activity is independent of p53, although the overall p21WAF1/CIP1 promoter activities are greatly reduced in the absence of p53. These results provide a molecular basis for differential regulation of the cell cycle and transformation by α- and β-PDGFRs.

Although a number of signaling molecules activated by PDGFRs have been identified, little is known about which signaling pathways are α- or β-PDGFR-specific, and how these signal transduction pathways are agonized or antagonized to regulate PDGF isoform-specific cellular processes. To investigate α- and β-PDGFR-specific pathways, we previously established NIH 3T3 clones in which α-PDGFR signaling is inhibited by a dominant-negative α-PDGFR or an antisense construct of α-PDGFR. By using these clones, we showed that α-PDGFR, but not β-PDGFR, activates stress-activated protein kinase-1/c-Jun NH2-terminal kinase-1 (SAPK1/JNK-1), whereas both α- and β-receptors effectively activate ERKs. Inhibition of α-PDGFR-activated JNK-1 enhanced PDGF BB-mediated phenotypic transformation, revealing a part of PDGFR subunit-specific signal transduction pathways critical for regulation of cell growth and transformation (10.Yu J. Deuel T.F. Kim H.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 19076-19082Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). In this study, we further investigated α- and β-PDGFR-specific regulation of cell growth signaling. PDGF was shown to function with serum-starved cells as a “competence” factor to induce expression of a set of immediate-early response genes critical for cell cycle entry (11.Stiles C.D. Capone G.T.

For PDGF-stimulated cells to progress efficiently beyond the G1/S checkpoint and transit the cell cycle and proliferate, progression factors in serum such as insulin and insulin-like growth factor I are required. The significance of cell cycle-dependent kinase inhibitors in the regulation of cell cycle checkpoints and transformation has been well documented. Among those, p21WAF1/CIP1 has been shown to be critical for tumor suppressing activity and cell cycle arrest at the G1/S checkpoint (16.Tarunina M. Grimaldi M. Ruaro E. Pavlenko M. Schneider C. Jenkins J.R. Oncogene. 1996; 13: 589-598PubMed Google Scholar, 17.Polyak K. Waldman T. He T.C. Kinzler K.W. Vogelstein B.

Trent J.M. Lin D. Mercer W.E. Kinzler K.W. Vogelstein B. Cell. 1993; 75: 817-825Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (7957) Google Scholar), independently as an inhibitor of cyclin-dependent kinases (CIP1) (21.Harper J.W. Adami G.R. Wei N. Keyomarsi K.

Nature. 1993; 366: 701-704Crossref PubMed Scopus (3179) Google Scholar), and also as a gene that is differentially expressed during cellular senescence (SDI1) (23.Noda A. Ning Y. Venable S.F. Pereira-Smith O.M. Smith J.R. Exp. Cell Res. 1994; 211: 90-98Crossref PubMed Scopus (1317) Google Scholar). Interestingly, growth factors such as PDGF and basic fibroblast growth factor (bFGF), but not insulin, were shown to induce transcription of p21WAF1/CIP1 independent of p53 (24.Michieli P. Chedid M. Lin D. Pierce J.H. Mercer W.E. Givol D. Cancer Res. 1994; 54: 3391-3395PubMed Google Scholar). Currently, neither the PDGF-signaling pathways leading to p21WAF1/CIP1 induction nor its significance in the regulation of cell cycle/transformation is clearly understood. Here we show that inhibition of α-PDGFR signaling results in a more efficient cell cycle transition from the G1 to S phase. PDGF AA activation of α-PDGFR or PDGF BB activation of both α- and β-PDGFRs mediates up-regulation of p21WAF1/CIP1 expression. However, β-PDGFR activation alone fails to induce p21WAF1/CIP1 expression indicating that α-PDGFR signaling is critical for the regulation of p21WAF1/CIP1 expression. We demonstrate that α-PDGFR-activated JNK-1 is a critical signaling component for the PDGF induction of p21WAF1/CIP1 promoter activity, providing a molecular basis for α-PDGFR-mediated growth inhibitory signal. We also provide evidence that the ability of PDGF/JNK-1 to induce p21WAF1/CIP1 promoter activity is independent of p53, although the overall p21WAF1/CIP1 promoter activities are greatly reduced in the absence of p53. Cell Culture and Antibodies—NIH 3T3 cells were cultured in a humidified 5% CO2 incubator with Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium/F12 nutrient media (DMEM/F12) containing 10% bovine calf serum, 2mm glutamine, 100 units/ml penicillin, 100 mg/ml streptomycin, 250 μg/ml amphotericin B, and 205 μg/ml sodium deoxycholate (Invitrogen). Serum-deprived subconfluent cells were treated with DMEM/F12 containing different concentrations of PDGF or bFGF. Protein or RNA samples were collected at different time intervals. Anti-active JNK antibody was purchased from Promega (Madison, WI), anti-p21WAF1/CIP1 mAb from Oncogene, anti-β-actin antibody from Sigma, anti-phosphotyrosine antibody from Oncogene Research Product (Cambridge, MA), anti-α PDGFR from Santa Cruz Biotechnology (Santa Cruz, CA), and Ab 262 was obtained as described previously (25.Bejcek B.E. Voravud N. Deuel T.F. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1993; 196: 69-78Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar). PDGF was purchased from Oncogene Research Product and bFGF from Invitrogen. Northern Blot Analysis—Total RNA was isolated with TRIzol Reagent according to the manufacturer's protocol (Invitrogen). Total RNA (20 μg) was resolved in a 1% agarose gel containing 2.2 m formaldehyde, transferred to the nylon membrane using the Turboblotter® system (Schleicher & Schuell), and cross-linked to the nylon membranes using an ultraviolet cross-linker at a dose of 120 mJ/cm2 (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA). [α-32P]dCTP-labeled DNA probes were synthesized using a random priming DNA labeling method. Blots were hybridized to radioactively labeled p21WAF1/CIP1 probe. After stripping, the blots were further hybridized with glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH) probe to control RNA loading. Immunoblot Analysis—Cells were lysed in RIPA buffer (150 mm NaCl, 0.1% SDS, 0.5% sodium deoxycholate acid, 0.5% Nonidet P-40, 10 mm Tris, pH 7.4, 1 mm EDTA, 2 mm sodium vanadate, 2 mm sodium fluoride, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 10 μg/ml leupeptin, and 10 μg/ml aprotinin) or SDS lysis buffer (2% SDS, 125 mm Tris-HCl, pH 6.8, and 20% glycerol), and protein concentration was determined using the BCA Protein Assay kit from Pierce. Equal amounts of protein in each sample were separated by SDS-PAGE and transferred to a nitrocellulose membrane. Membranes were subjected to 1 h of blocking with 5% non-fat milk in T-TBS (0.02% Tween 20, 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl), followed by incubation with primary antibodies in TTBS containing 5% non-fat milk for 1 h. After three washes with T-TBS, the blot was incubated with the appropriate horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibody. The antigen was detected using the ECL detection system (Pierce) according to the manufacturer's instruction. Promoter Activity Assay—The luciferase reporter construct of p21WAF1/CIP1 promoter (WWP-Luc) was provided by Dr. B. Vogelstein (20.el-Deiry W.S. Tokino T. Velculescu V.E. Levy D.B. Parsons R. Trent J.M. Lin D. Mercer W.E. Kinzler K.W. Vogelstein B. Cell. 1993; 75: 817-825Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (7957) Google Scholar). The -2327-p21P, -194-p21P, -64-p21P, and -2327(d-127–64)p21P plasmids were obtained from Dr. X. F. Wang (26.Datto M.B. Yu Y. Wang X.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 28623-28628Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (399) Google Scholar). Subconfluent cells growing in a 6- or 12-well plate were co-transfected with p21WAF1/CIP1 promoter luciferase reporter constructs, β-galactosidase expression plasmid (pMDV-LacZ), and other constructs as specified in the figure legends. After 16–20 h of transfection, cells were cultured in serum-free medium for 36 h and treated with 25 ng/ml PDGF AA or PDGF BB for 3 h. Cells were washed with ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline and lysed in 200 μl of reporter lysis buffer (Promega). Luciferase and β-galactosidase activities were assayed using a luciferase assay kit (Promega) and the Galacto-Light kit (Applied Biosystems, Bedford, MA), respectively, and were measured subsequently with Turner TD-20e (Promega) or Fusion System (Packard) luminometer. The luciferase activity was normalized to β-galactosidase activity to control the transfection efficiency. Data represent at least two independent experiments performed in triplicate. The luciferase activity in serum-starved cells was arbitrarily given as 1; PDGF-induced p21WAF1/CIP1 promoter activity was calculated as fold increase in luciferase activity of growth factor-treated cells as compared with that of serum-starved cells. Real Time Quantitative PCR Analysis—Total RNA was extracted from the cells using Trizol reagent (Invitrogen). Five or 10 μg of each RNA sample was reverse-transcribed to first strand cDNA using an oligo(dT) primer (Invitrogen). Equal amounts of the reverse transcription products were applied to real time quantitative PCR (Q-PCR) analysis using p21WAF1/CIP1-specific primer pairs and the intercalating dye SYBR Green I, as recommended by the manufacturer (Stratagene). The real time Q-PCR was performed on a Bio-Rad iCycler. The PCR cycling profile was as follows: 10 min of hot start at 95 °C; 35 cycles of denaturation at 95 °C for 60 s, annealing at 60 °C for 60 s, and extension at 72 °C for 60 s. Fluorescent reading was captured at the end of the extension step. GAPDH primer pairs were used for normalization in separate real time Q-PCRs. At least triplicate reactions were performed for each sample and primer. The relative gene expression was calculated in reference to the expression level of the control cells without PDGF treatment. The PCR primer sets used were as follows: p21WAF1/CIP1-specific forward primer, 5′-GTACTTCCTCTGCCCTGCTG-3′, p21WAF1/CIP1-specific reverse primer, 5′-CACAGAGTGAGGGCTAAGGC-3′; and GAPDH forward primer, 5′-ATCACCATCTTCCAGGAGCGA-3′, GAPDH reverse primer, 5′-GCCAGTGAGCTTCCCGTTCA-3′. Flow Cytometric Analysis—Subconfluent cells were synchronized at G0 by culturing in serum-free DMEM/F12 medium for 24 h. Cells were treated with DMEM/F12 containing 0, 10, or 25 ng/ml PDGF BB. At a 16-h interval, the cells were collected by trypsinization, washed with 1× PBS, and fixed in 67% ethanol for 24 h at 4 °C. The nuclei were stained with propidium iodine at 20 μg/ml for 30 min, and the DNA content of the cells was determined using a FACScan (BD Biosciences). Twenty thousands cells were counted, and the percentage of cells in each phase of the cell cycle was analyzed by Modfit LT Software (Verity Software House, Topsham, ME). α-PDGFR Is Critical for PDGF-induced p21WAF1/CIP1 Expression, and Cell Cycle Transition from the G1 to S Phase—To investigate the α- and β-PDGFR specific signaling and their functions, we previously established two separate NIH 3T3 clones in which α-PDGFR activation is inhibited. The first approach was to down-regulate α-PDGFR expression by using an antisense construct of α-PDGFR cDNA (AS α-PDGFR). The second approach was to prevent activation of α-PDGFR by using a dominant-negative mutant of α-PDGFR that contains the extracellular and transmembrane domains but lacks the cytoplasmic kinase domains (DN α-PDGFR). The α-PDGFR expression was significantly down-regulated by AS α-PDGFR (Fig. 1A), and PDGF AA-mediated autophosphorylation of endogenous α-PDGFR was inhibited by DN α-PDGFR (Fig. 1B). As shown in Fig 1C, PDGF BB activation of α-PDGFR was also inhibited in AS and DN clones. This confirmed the significant inhibition of α-PDGFR activation in AS and DN clones as reported previously (10.Yu J. Deuel T.F. Kim H.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 19076-19082Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). By using AS, DN clones, and control NIH 3T3 cells, we examined whether α- and β-PDGFRs differentially regulate expression of p21WAF1/CIP1, a cell cycle inhibitor and a downstream mediator of tumor suppressing activity of p53 (16.Tarunina M. Grimaldi M. Ruaro E. Pavlenko M. Schneider C. Jenkins J.R. Oncogene. 1996; 13: 589-598PubMed Google Scholar, 17.Polyak K. Waldman T. He T.C. Kinzler K.W. Vogelstein B.

Cazorla M. Balbin M. Jares P. Fernandez P.L. Montserrat E. Cardesa A. Lopez-Otin C. Campo E. Blood. 1997; 89: 272-280Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The effects of PDGF AA activation of α-PDGFR alone and PDGF BB activation of both α- and β-PDGFRs were examined in control NIH 3T3 cells that express both α- and β-PDGFRs at comparable levels. The effect of PDGF BB activation of β-PDGFR alone was determined in AS and DN clones (10.Yu J. Deuel T.F. Kim H.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 19076-19082Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). Northern blot analysis showed that PDGF AA activation of α-PDGFR in control NIH 3T3 cells up-regulated p21WAF1/CIP1 mRNA expression, whereas no significant increase in p21WAF1/CIP1 mRNA levels was detected in AS and DN clones following PDGF AA treatment (Fig. 1D). PDGF BB activation of both α- and β-PDGFRs effectively induced p21WAF1/CIP1 mRNA expression in control NIH 3T3 cells (Fig. 1E). In contrast, when β-PDGFR alone was activated by PDGF BB in AS and DN clones, p21WAF1/CIP1 induction was significantly reduced (Fig. 1E). To ensure that down-regulation of PDGF-induced p21WAF1/CIP1 expression resulted from the inhibition of α-PDGFR signaling in the AS and DN clones and not from lack of response to growth factors, bFGF-induced p21WAF1/CIP1 expression was examined. The bFGF-induced p21WAF1/CIP1 expression levels were comparable among control NIH 3T3, DN, and AS clones (Fig. 1F). These results indicate a critical role for α-PDGFR in PDGF-induced p21WAF1/CIP1 expression. PDGF AA- and BB-induced p21WAF1/CIP1 mRNA expression was quantitated by real time PCR analysis (Fig. 1G). PDGF AA and BB induced p21WAF1/CIP1 mRNA levels ∼2.7- and ∼3.2-fold, respectively, in control NIH 3T3 cells. In DN and AS clones, PDGF AA, as expected, failed to activate p21WAF1/CIP1 expression due to lack of α-PDGFR activation. When the effect of PDGF BB activation of β-PDGFR alone was examined in these clones, only a marginal induction of p21WAF1/CIP1 mRNA levels was detected. It should be noted that PDGF BB treatment of AS clones resulted in detectable increase in p21WAF1/CIP1 mRNA levels (∼1.3-fold). We speculate that these cells express residual amounts of α-PDGFR, and mild activation of the α-PDGFR signaling pathway results from αβ-PDGFR heterodimerization following PDGF BB treatment. Down-regulation of PDGF AA- and BB-induced p21WAF1/CIP1 protein expression in AS and DN cells was also confirmed by immunoblot analysis (Fig. 1, H and I). Next we asked whether α- and β-PDGFRs differentially regulate cell cycle transition from the G1 to S phase. To answer this question, we determined what percentages of control NIH, AS, and DN cells were in each phase of the cell cycle following activation of β-PDGFR alone or both α- and β-PDGFRs (Table I). Flow cytometric analysis revealed that cells entered into the S phase more efficiently following β-PDGFR activation in the absence of α-PDGFR signaling: ∼35% of AS and ∼50% DN cells were in the S phase at 16 h following 25 ng/ml PDGF BB activation of β-PDGFR alone, whereas ∼25% of NIH 3T3 cells were in the S phase following PDGF BB activation of both α- and β-PDGFRs. These data suggest that α-PDGFR signaling is critical for PDGF to function as a bona fide “competent growth factor,” which has the ability to halt the cell cycle transition at the G1/S checkpoint.Table IInhibition of α-PDGFR promotes PDGF BB-mediated cell cycle transition from G1 to S phase. Subconfluent control (Ctrl), antisense (AS6), and dominant negative (DN16) clones were deprived of serum for 24 h and subsequently treated with serum-free DMEM/F12 containing 0, 10, and 25 ng/ml PDGF BB for 16 h. Cells were trypsinized, washed with 1 × PBS, and fixed in 67% ethanol for 24 h at 4 °C. The DNA content was measured by staining the nuclei with propidium iodine (PI), followed by FACScan analysis. The percentage of cells in each cell cycle phase is presented.ClonesCell cycle phasePDGF BB concentration0 ng/ml10 ng/ml25 ng/mlCtrlG0/G179.4266.7266.74S14.6425.2725.93G2/M5.958.017.33AS6G0/G170.658.357.51S21.7634.2835.45G2/M4.647.427.04DN16G0/G176.0948.7741.56S19.7745.7652.44G2/M4.145.466.0 Open table in a new tab α-PDGFR Is Critical for PDGF-induced p21WAF1/CIP1 Promoter Activity—To determine whether α-PDGFR-induced p21WAF1/CIP1 expression occurs at the transcriptional level, we measured p21WAF1/CIP1 promoter activity using a luciferase reporter gene under the control of a 2.4-kb p21WAF1/CIP1 promoter (WWP-Luc, kindly provided by Dr. B. Vogelstein). The p21WAF1/CIP1 promoter activity was significantly enhanced in the control NIH 3T3 cells following PDGF AA or PDGF BB treatment (1.6–1.8-fold) (Fig. 2A). Neither PDGF AA nor PDGF BB, however, induced p21WAF1/CIP1 promoter activity in DN and AS clones (Fig. 2, B and C). To exclude the possibility that the lack of PDGF-induced p21WAF1/CIP1 promoter activity is associated with inherent clonal defects in p21WAF1/CIP1 regulation, the bFGF-induced p21WAF1/CIP1 promoter was also examined. As shown in Fig. 2D, induction of p21WAF1/CIP1 promoter activity was comparable among control NIH 3T3, DN, and AS clones following bFGF treatment. This supports the conclusion that the lack of PDGF BB activation of p21WAF1/CIP1 promoter in DN and AS clones resulted from lack of α-PDGFR signaling. α-PDGFR-activated JNK-1 Is a Critical Signaling Component for PDGF-induced p21WAF1/CIP1 Promoter Activity—We demonstrated previously that although both α- and β-PDGFRs activate ERKs, α-PDGFR, but not β-PDGFR, effectively activates stress-activated protein kinase-1/c-Jun NH2-terminal kinase-1 (JNK-1), revealing differential regulation of Ras-mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) pathways by α- and β-PDGFRs. Because JNK-1 was shown to regulate gene expression through phosphorylation of transcription factors (27.Janknecht R. Hunter T. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 4219-4224Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar, 28.Pozas E. Ballabriga J. Planas A.M. Ferrer I. J.

Immunol. 1997; 159: 3508-3518PubMed Google Scholar), we questioned whether α-PDGFR-induced p21WAF1/CIP1 transcriptional activation involves JNK-1 signaling. To evaluate the significance of JNK-1 for PDGF-induced p21WAF1/CIP1 expression, we inhibited JNK-1 activation by transient transfection of JNK-1-APF plasmid (a dominant-negative mutant of JNK-1 (DN JNK-1), kindly provided by Dr. R. Davis). Whereas DN JNK-1 transfection did not alter p21WAF1/CIP1 promoter activity in the absence of exogenous PDGF, increased amounts of DN-JNK-1 expression abolished both PDGF AA- and BB-induced p21WAF1/CIP1 promoter activity in NIH 3T3 cells (Fig. 3, A–C). To confirm further the significance of JNK-1 in PDGF induction of p21WAF1/CIP1, we also examined the effect of enhanced JNK-1 activity. PDGF-induced p21WAF1/CIP1 promoter activity was greatly enhanced (∼4-fold) by transient transfection with increasing amounts of wild-type JNK-1 expression plasmids into the NIH 3T3 cells (Fig. 3, D–F). A critical role of JNK-1 in PDGF-induced p21WAF1/CIP1 promoter activity was confirmed by using NIH 3T3 clone in which wild-type JNK-1 construct was stably transfected (Fig. 3I). Similarly, requirement of JNK-1 signaling for PDGF-induced p21WAF1/CIP1 expression was also confirmed by measuring p21WAF1/CIP1 promoter activity as well as p21WAF1/CIP1 protein levels using NIH 3T3 clone in which DN JNK-1 construct was stably transfected (Fig. 3, I and J). We then examined whether PDGF induction of p21WAF1/CIP1 promoter activity can be restored by enhanced JNK-1 activation in DN and AS clones. When JNK-1 activation was enhanced by wild-type JNK-1 overexpression, PDGF-induced p21WAF1/CIP1 promoter activity was significantly induced in both AS and DN clones (Fig. 3, G and H), re-emphasizing the significant role of JNK-1 in PDGF regulation of p21WAF1/CIP1 promoter activity.

The E3 transmembrane proteins 10.4 and 14.5 form a complex that down-regulates the epidermal growth factor receptor and apoptosis receptors from the cell surface by diverting them to endosomes/lysosomes for degradation. The latter process protects infected cells from ligand-induced apoptosis. The mechanism by which 10.4-14.5 mediate re-routing remains elusive. We examined the role of putative YXXΦ and dileucine (LL) transport motifs within Ad2 10.4-14.5 for target protein modulation. By generating stable E3 transfectants expressing 10.4-14.5 proteins with alanine substitutions in these motifs, we show that 3 of the 5 motifs are essential for functional activity. Whereas tyrosine 74 in 14.5 appears to be important for efficient 10.4-14.5 interaction, the 122YXXΦ motif in 14.5 and the dileucine motif Leu 87-Leu88 in 10.4 constitute genuine transport motifs: disruption of either motif abolished binding to the cellular adaptor proteins AP-1 and AP-2, as shown by surface plasmon resonance spectroscopy, and caused missorting, dramatically altering cell surface appearance and the intracellular location of viral proteins. Fluorescence-activated cell sorter analysis and immunofluorescence data provide evidence that Tyr122 in 14.5 is essential for rapid endocytosis of the 10.4-14.5 complex, whereas the 10.4LL motif acts down-stream and protects 10.4-14.5 from extensive degradation by rerouting it into a recycling pathway. Infection of primary cells with adenoviruses carrying the relevant point mutations confirmed the crucial role of these transport motifs for down-regulation of Fas, TRAIL-R1, TRAIL-R2, and epidermal growth factor receptor.

The 10.4-14.5 proteins prevent Fas-mediated apoptosis by removal of Fas from the cell surface and by redirecting it to endosomal/lysosomal vesicles where it is degraded (11Shisler J. Yang C.

Surprisingly, down-regulation of the related TRAIL-R2/DR5 required in addition the activity of a third E3 protein, 6.7K (15Benedict C.A. Norris P.S. Prigozy T.I. Bodmer J.L. Mahr J.A. Garnett C.T.

Jefferies W.A. J. Virol. 2002; 76: 1578-1587Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). In infected human cells, 10.4-14.5 were also reported to contribute to inhibition of tumor necrosis factor-induced cytolysis. This is not achieved by tumor necrosis factor receptor modulation but rather by inhibition of tumor necrosis factor-induced translocation of cytosolic phospholipase A2 and possibly nuclear factor κB (3Wold W.S.

Initially, it was suggested that 10.4 alone is responsible for EGFR modulation (19Carlin C.R. Tollefson A.E. Brady H.A. Hoffman B.L. Wold W.S. Cell. 1989; 57: 135-144Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar). However, subsequent reports demonstrated that efficient down-regulation depends on both proteins (12Tollefson A.E. Hermiston T.W. Lichtenstein D.L. Colle C.F. Tripp R.A. Dimitrov T. Toth K. Wells C.E. Doherty P.C. Wold W.S. Nature. 1998; 392: 726-730Crossref PubMed Scopus (180) Google Scholar, 13Elsing A.

Virol. 1991; 65: 3095-3105Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Taken together, the 10.4-14.5 complex, also named receptor internalization and degradation (RID), modulates a selective set of plasma membrane receptors involved in apoptosis and growth control (13Elsing A.

E3/10.4 and 14.5 are encoded by human Ads from all subgenera and therefore are likely to be of general importance for Ad-host interaction (1Burgert H.-G. Ruzsics Z. Obermeier S. Hilgendorf A. Windheim M. Elsing A. Curr. Top. Microbiol. Immunol. 2002; 269: 274-319Google Scholar, 2Burgert H.-G. Blusch J.H. Virus Genes. 2000; 21: 13-25Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). 10.4 is expressed as two isoforms: in one the signal peptide is cleaved, whereas in the other it remains attached and serves as a second membrane anchor (Fig. 1A). The two 10.4 species form a disulfide-linked dimer via a conserved cysteine residue at position 31 (24Hoffman P. Yaffe M.B. Hoffman B.L. Yei S. Wold W.S. Carlin C. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 13480-13487Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and associate non-covalently with the 14.5 protein in the ER (3Wold W.S. Tollefson A.E. Hermiston T.W. Curr. Top. Microbiol. Immunol. 1995; 199: 237-274PubMed Google Scholar). 14.5 is a type I transmembrane protein and the Ad5 product has been shown to be O-glycosylated and serine-phosphorylated (3Wold W.S. Tollefson A.E. Hermiston T.W. Curr. Top. Microbiol. Immunol. 1995; 199: 237-274PubMed Google Scholar, 25Lichtenstein D. Krajcsi P. Esteban D. Tollefson A. Wold W. J. Virol. 2002; 76: 11329-11342Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). Both proteins seem to be exposed on the plasma membrane (26Stewart A.R. Tollefson A.E. Krajcsi P. Yei S.P. Wold W.S. J. Virol. 1995; 69: 172-181Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), but a thorough quantitative assessment is lacking. A wealth of information exists about trafficking and in particular ligand-induced down-regulation of the EGFR (27Carpenter G. Bioessays. 2000; 22: 697-707Crossref PubMed Scopus (305) Google Scholar, 28Sorkin A. Von-Zastrow M. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell.

EGF binding to the receptor triggers its tyrosine kinase activity and enhances the rate of internalization into early endosomes (EE). From EE, the EGFR may rapidly return to the cell surface, whereas a significant pool of EGF-EGFR complexes is sorted to the inner vesicles of a late endosomal compartment, designated multivesicular bodies (MVBs). This pool is destined for degradation in lysosomes and is segregated from the pool of recycling receptors recruited to the limiting membrane of MVBs. This major sorting step is controlled by EGFR tyrosine kinase activity, ubiquitination, and a variety of cytosolic factors (30Felder S. Miller K. Moehren G. Ullrich A. Schlessinger J. Hopkins C.R. Cell. 1990; 61: 623-634Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (351) Google Scholar, 31Gruenberg J. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 2: 721-730Crossref PubMed Scopus (584) Google Scholar, 32Raiborg C.

Traffic. 2001; 2: 612-621Crossref PubMed Scopus (168) Google Scholar). Cell fractionation and immunochemical approaches (34Crooks D. Kil S.J. McCaffery J.M. Carlin C. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2000; 11: 3559-3572Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar) suggested that overexpressed 10.4 (by these authors called 13.7) may be located in EE and MVBs, and it was predicted that 10.4 may have signals for endosomal retention/retrieval and for directing EGFR to lysosomes. No attempt was made to experimentally identify these signals. Unlike EGF, 10.4-14.5 do not appear to accelerate EGFR endocytosis, but rather modulate intracellular sorting of constitutively internalized EGFR (21Hoffman P. Carlin C. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 3695-3706Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). The underlying mechanism as to how this is achieved and which features of the viral proteins are responsible for the altered fate of EGF and death receptors remains elusive. Interestingly, both viral proteins contain sequence elements in their cytoplasmic tails that conform to consensus transport motifs (Fig. 1): three putative YXXΦ motifs (where Y is a tyrosine, X any amino acid (aa), and Φ (an aa with a bulky hydrophobic side chain) are present in 14.5 (Fig. 1B), whereas 10.4 proteins generally display two potential dileucine (LL) motifs (Fig. 1C). Both tyrosine- and dileucine-based motifs have been shown to trigger rapid internalization from the cell surface, specify sorting to lysosomes or specialized endosomal/lysosomal compartments; they also mediate trafficking to the trans-Golgi network (TGN) as well as sorting to the basolateral plasma membrane of polarized epithelial cells (35Heilker R. Spiess M. Crottet P. Bioessays. 1999; 21: 558-567Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar, 36Bonifacino J.S. Traub L.M. Annu. Rev.

Both types of motifs are recognized by adaptor proteins (APs) (36Bonifacino J.S. Traub L.M. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2003; 72: 395-447Crossref PubMed Scopus (1665) Google Scholar, 38Kirchhausen T. Annu.

Cell Biol. 2001; 13: 444-453Crossref PubMed Scopus (444) Google Scholar). To date, four types of heterotetrameric AP complexes (AP-1 to AP-4) have been described, which differ in their association with different cellular compartments and, therefore, appear to be involved in distinct sorting events. AP-2 is located mainly at the plasma membrane and is involved in clathrin-dependent endocytosis, whereas AP-1 is found in coated buds of the TGN, but also on endosomes (40Meyer C. Zizioli D. Lausmann S. Eskelinen E.L. Hamann J. Saftig P. von Figura K. Schu P. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 2193-2203Crossref PubMed Scopus (356) Google Scholar). AP-3 and AP-4 are also supposed to mediate trafficking from the TGN to endosomes. In addition to APs, several monomeric proteins have been described as adaptors and/or cooperating partners of APs for TGN-endosome and endosome-TGN cargo selection (36Bonifacino J.S. Traub L.M. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2003; 72: 395-447Crossref PubMed Scopus (1665) Google Scholar, 41Wan L. Molloy S.S. Thomas L. Liu G. Xiang Y. Rybak S.L. Thomas G.

Cell. 1998; 93: 433-443Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (327) Google Scholar). In this study, we investigated the potential role of YXXΦ and dileucine motifs for the function of the Ad2 10.4-14.5 complex. We demonstrate that a conserved dileucine motif in 10.4 and a conserved YXXΦ-type motif in 14.5 bind AP-1 and AP-2 in vitro and are key determinants for receptor down-modulation in vivo. Evidence is provided that both function as transport motifs in a sequential manner. Whereas YXXΦ is important for endocytosis of the 10.4-14.5 complex, the LL motif contributes to the efficacy of receptor down-modulation by targeting 10.4-14.5 from a degradative into a recycling pathway. Our findings illustrate the highly sophisticated cooperation between two viral proteins, each providing a distinct transport signal required for efficient target removal and immune evasion. Construction of Mutant Genes—Plasmid pBSΔX-E3 (13Elsing A. Burgert H.-G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 10072-10077Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar) was used as template for PCR-mediated site-directed mutagenesis, generating alanine replacement mutants 14.5Y74A, 14.5Y76A, 14.5Y122A, and 10.4LLAA. pBSΔX-E3 is a derivative of pBluescript II KS (Stratagene) containing the EcoRVc fragment of Ad2, which encompasses the entire E3 region including the endogenous E3 promoter (43Körner H. Fritzsche U. Burgert H.-G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 11857-11861Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). pBSΔX-E3 was also utilized for introducing the FLAG tag DYKDDDDK downstream of the 14.5K signal sequence yielding pBSΔX-E3F14.5. This plasmid served as template for generating Ala replacement mutants of F14.5Y122, 10.4LL, and 10.4IL in a two-step PCR using primers containing the relevant mutation together with flanking primers homologous to the 10.4 and 14.7 open reading frame (13Elsing A. Burgert H.-G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 10072-10077Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar). PCR fragments containing the mutation were cloned into the XhoI and HpaI sites of the pBSΔX-E3 and pBSΔX-E3F14.5 vectors, respectively. All primer sequences are available upon request. For expression of 10.4 and 14.5 from the heterologous SV40 promoter/enhancer the vector pSG5 (Stratagene) was used. PCR fragments containing the Ad2 coding sequence of the 10.4, 14.5, or both genes were cloned between the EcoRI and BglII or the BamHI and BglII sites, respectively. For optimizing expression, the sequence 5′ of the ATG was modified to conform to the Kozak consensus for translation (44Kozak M. Gene (Amst.). 1999; 234: 187-208Crossref PubMed Scopus (1133) Google Scholar). All constructs were verified by dye terminator cycle sequencing. Cell Lines, Culture Conditions, Transfection—HEK 293 (ATCC CRL 1573), A549 (ATCC CCL 185), a human lung carcinoma-derived epithelial cell line, and primary human foreskin fibroblasts (SeBu) (13Elsing A. Burgert H.-G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Hess S. Ziegler-Heitbrock H.W. Riethmuller G. Engelmann H. J. Inflamm. 1995; 45: 161-174PubMed Google Scholar) was propagated in the same medium supplemented with 200 μg/ml G418 (Invitrogen). Cotransfection of human 293 cells with modified pBSΔX-E3 or pBSΔX-E3F14.5 plasmids and the pSV2-neo plasmid encoding the neomycin-phosphotransferase gene as selectable marker, selection, and subsequent culture of stable transfectants was done as described (46Sester M. Burgert H.-G. J. Virol. 1994; 68: 5423-5432Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). For transient transfections the calcium phosphate method was used, essentially as described in Ref. 47Sambrook J.

MAbs and Antisera—The following monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) were used: Tw1.3 against E3/19K (48Cox J.H. Bennink J.R. Yewdell J.W. J. Exp. Med. 1991; 174: 1629-1637Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar); W6/32 (ATCC HB 95), anti-HLA-ABC; B-G27 (Chemicon, Hofheim Germany) against human CD95; 528 (ATCC HB 8509) directed to the extracellular portion of the EGFR; M1 (Sigma) against the FLAG-octapeptide; 2D5 directed to Lamp2 (49Diettrich O.

Nature. 1998; 392: 193-197Crossref PubMed Scopus (658) Google Scholar), HS101 against TRAIL-R1 (DR4), and HS201 against TRAIL-R2 (DR5) (Alexis Biochemicals, Gruenberg, Germany). Rabbit sera Bur4 and Bur3 raised against COOH-terminal 14.5 (CEISYFNLTGGDD) and 10.4 (CYRDRTIADLLRIL) peptides (Fig. 1, B and C), respectively, have been described (13Elsing A. Burgert H.-G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 10072-10077Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar), as was rabbit serum RαE19 against Ad2 E3/19K (46Sester M. Burgert H.-G. J. Virol. 1994; 68: 5423-5432Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). To detect the 10.4LL mutant, peptide CYRDRTIADAARIL was coupled to keyhole limpet hemocyanin to generate rabbit serum R71. Antiserum R59 was generated upon immunization with the peptide FIDWVCVRIAYLRHHPQYRDRTIADLLRIL (Sigma) representing the entire cytoplasmic tail of 10.4. The anti-human TGN46 sheep serum was initially provided by S. Ponnambalam (University of Leeds, Leeds, UK) and was subsequently purchased from Serotec-Biozol, Munich, Germany. Fluorescein isothiocyanate- or rhodamine-conjugated donkey anti-rabbit, antimouse, or anti-sheep immunoglobulin G, respectively, for immunofluorescence and peroxidase-conjugated AffiniPure goat anti-rabbit IgG (H+L) for Western blot detection were purchased from Dianova, Hamburg, Germany. For flow cytometry, goat anti-mouse and goat anti-rabbit fluorescein isothiocyanate IgG from Sigma were used. Viruses—Ad2 mutant viruses were generated with a novel method combining ET cloning and transposon integration. 2Z. Ruzsics, M. Wagner, U. Koszinowski, H.-G. Burgert, unpublished data. This method allows the introduction of any mutation into Ad genomes independent of restriction sites. Infectious virus particles were reconstituted upon calcium phosphate transfection of linear wt or mutant Ad plasmid DNA into 293 cells. Viruses were propagated and titrated on A549 cells as described (51Mittereder N. March K.L. Trapnell B.C. J. Virol. 1996; 70: 7498-7509Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In general, cells were infected with 100 plaque forming units/cell. Flow Cytometry—Fluorescence activated cell sorting (FACS) was done essentially as described (13Elsing A. Burgert H.-G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 10072-10077Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar, 46Sester M. Burgert H.-G. J. Virol. 1994; 68: 5423-5432Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) except that 3-5 × 105 cells/sample were used. In experiments using the anti-FLAG mAb M1 the FACS buffer was supplemented with 1 mm CaCl2. Fluorescence profiles were obtained by analyzing 5000 viable cells in a FACScalibur flow cytometer using the CellQuest software (BD Biosciences). Immunoprecipitation, SDS-PAGE, and Immunoblotting—Immunoprecipitation (IP) and SDS-PAGE were carried out essentially as described (6Burgert H.-G. Kvist S. Cell. 1985; 41: 987-997Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (297) Google Scholar). Approximately equal numbers of cells (∼4 × 106/sample) were lysed in 1% Triton X-100 (Roche Diagnostics) or digitonin (high purity; Calbiochem). The protein concentration was measured by the BCA method according to the manufacturer (Pierce). Equal amounts of protein were used for immunoprecipitation of 10.4 and 14.5, employing R59 and Bur4, respectively. Immunocomplexes were extensively washed and separated on 15% acrylamide SDS minigels (Bio-Rad). The proteins were blotted for 80 min at 0.8 mA per cm2 onto Hybond ECL nitrocellulose membranes (Amersham Biosciences) using a semi-dry transfer cell (Trans-Blot SD, Bio-Rad) and 48 mm Tris, 39 mm glycine, 0.37% SDS, 20% methanol as blotting buffer. Nonspecific binding sites were blocked overnight in phosphate-buffered saline containing 5% skim milk, 0.05% Tween 20, and 0.02% sodium azide followed by incubation of the membrane with primary antibody for 1 h at room temperature. For Western blotting of 10.4 and 14.5, Bur3 and Bur4 were used, respectively. As Bur3 exhibited only a marginal reactivity to the 10.4 mutants, R71 was applied for IP and Western blot detection of the LLAA mutant and R59 for the ILAA mutant. All antisera were diluted 1:200. Proteins were visualized using peroxidase-conjugated goat anti-rabbit IgG (H+L) (1:10000), ECL detection reagent (Amersham Biosciences), and exposure to Bio-Max MR film (Kodak). Confocal Immunofluorescence Microscopy—Cells were processed for immunofluorescence as described (52Windheim M. Burgert H.-G. J. Virol. 2002; 76: 755-766Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). Surface Plasmon Resonance Spectroscopy (SPR)—The interaction of purified AP-1 and AP-2 adaptors with putative sorting motifs of 10.4 and 14.5 was recorded in real-time using a BIAcore 3000 biosensor (BIAcore AB, Sweden). Synthetic peptides, depicted in Fig. 1, B and C (SPR), were purified by reverse phase high performance liquid chromatography and immobilized to the surface of a CM5 sensor chip via their NH2-terminal cysteine, using thiol coupling chemistry. Subsequently, AP-1 and AP-2 (at concentrations ranging from 100 to 500 nm) were passed over the sensor surface to monitor binding to the immobilized peptides and to determine the rate constants (ka, kd, and KD = kd/ka) of this interaction. The purification of AP-1 and AP-2 as well as the details and principles of SPR are described elsewhere (53Höning S. Sosa M. Hille-Rehfeld A. von Figura K. J. Biol.

Identification of Putative Transport Signals in the Ad2 10.4 and 14.5 Protein Sequences—To search for structural features with potential functional relevance, we have sequenced the 10.4 and 14.5 genes of subgenus D and E Ads (1Burgert H.-G.

Virus Genes. 2000; 21: 13-25Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Comparison of 10.4 and 14.5 protein sequences from Ads of all subgenera revealed only 9 aa in 14.5 and 15 aa in 10.4 that are strictly conserved (1Burgert H.-G. Ruzsics Z. Obermeier S. Hilgendorf A. Windheim M. Elsing A. Curr. Top. Microbiol. Immunol. 2002; 269: 274-319Google Scholar). Some of these might be part of putative tyrosine- or dileucine-based transport motifs: in 14.5, two YXXΦ motifs, designated 74YXXΦ and 122YXXΦ (according to the position of the Y in the Ad2 14.5 sequence), are strictly conserved, although the bulky hydrophobic aa in position +3 varies (Fig. 1B). The 122YXXΦ motif is found in position -9 from the COOH terminus and Φ is Leu, Ile, or Phe, whereas 74YXXΦ might be located adjacent to or within the lipid bilayer and Φ is either Leu or Phe (Fig. 1, A and B). A third YXXΦ motif with Tyr at position 76, overlapping the 74YXXΦ motif, is present only in 14.5 proteins of subgenus C Ads. Two sequence elements reminiscent of dileucine transport motifs can be recognized in the cytoplasmic tail of 10.4 (Fig. 1C). One LL motif (Leu 87-Leu88 in the Ad2 sequence) is conserved at position -4/-5 from the COOH terminus (in Ad12 at -5/-6) with the first Leu being replaced by Ile in subgenus D proteins. The last two aa, either IL in subgenus C or LI in subgenera B, D, and E may also constitute transport motifs. Three of the Five Motifs Are Crucial for 10.4-14.5 Function in 293 Cells—To investigate whether these putative transport motifs are functionally relevant, the critical tyrosine and leucine residues were replaced by alanines.

We screened a human lung cDNA expression library for potential CaMKI substrates by solid phase in situ phosphorylation (“phosphorylation screening”). Multiple overlapping partial length cDNAs encoding three proteins were detected. Two of these proteins are known: 6-phosphofructo-2-kinase/fructose 2,6-bisphosphatase and eukaryotic translation initiation factor (eIF) 4GII. To determine whether CaMKI substrates identified by phosphorylation screening represent authentic physiological targets, we examined the potential for [Ca2+]i- and CaMKI-dependent phosphorylation of eIF4GII in vitro and in vivo. Endogenous eIF4GII immunoprecipitated from HEK293T cells was phosphorylated by CaMKI, in vitro as was a recombinant fragment of eIF4GII encompassing the central and C-terminal regions. The latter phosphorylation occurred with favorable kinetics (Km = 1 μm; kcat = 1.8 s–1) at a single site, Ser1156, located in a segment of eIF4GII aligning with the phosphoregion of eIF4GI. Phosphopeptide mapping and back phosphorylation experiments revealed [Ca2+]i-dependent, CaMKI site-specific, eIF4GII phosphorylation in vivo. This phosphorylation was blocked by kinase-negative CaMKI consistent with a requirement for endogenous CaMKI for in vivo eIF4GII phosphorylation. We conclude that phosphorylation screening is an effective method for searching for intracellular targets of CaMKI and may have identified a new role of Ca2+ signaling to the translation apparatus.

Because such effects regulate cellular events critical to cell survival, differentiation, and growth, identification of the corresponding intracellular targets of CaM kinases is of paramount importance. In those cases in which the respective CaM kinase is dedicated to a single physiological substrate, such identification has been relatively straightforward and has revealed mechanistic details of the Ca2+ control of intermediary metabolism (phosphorylase kinase), cytoskeletal dynamics (myosin kinases), and peptide chain elongation (elongation factor-2 kinase). There has also been considerable progress recently in identification of targets of the broad specificity CaM kinases, CaMKII and CaMKIV, involved in the molecular events underlying synaptic plasticity and transcriptional activation (reviewed in Refs. 3.Schulman H.

In counterpoint has been the notable lack of progress in identifying the intracellular targets of CaMKI, despite its identification as a distinct CaMK contemporaneously with CaMKII (7.Kennedy M.B.

Nonetheless, despite the lack of information regarding its physiological role(s), an important, perhaps essential, role for CaMKI in the regulation by [Ca2+]i of eukaryotic cell physiology may be postulated based on circumstantial observations. At both the mRNA and protein levels CaMKI is expressed in all mammalian cell and tissue types examined to date (19.Picciotto M.R. Czernik A.J. Nairn A.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 26512-26521Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 20.Ito T. Mochizuki H. Kato M. Nimura Y. Hanai T. Usuda N. Hidaka H. Arch. Biochem.

CaMKI also exhibits a widespread phylogenetic distribution, with either obvious orthologous cDNAs or cross-immunoreactive bands detectable in species as diverse as fission yeast, Caenorhabditis elegans, Drosophila, and vertebrates (21.Picciotto M.R. Zoli M. Bertuzzi G. Nairn A.C. Synapse. 1995; 20: 75-84Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar, 22.Eto K. Takahashi N. Kimura Y Masuho Y. Arai K. Muramatsu M. Tokumitsu H. J. Biol.

Finally, CaMKI is a downstream target of a signaling cascade initiated by elevation of [Ca2+]i (24.Aletta J.M. Selbert M.A. Nairn A.C. Edelman A.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 20930-20934Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). This cascade is tightly regulated by [Ca2+]i via three distinct mechanisms: (i) activating phosphorylation by two upstream CaMKI kinases, CaMKKα and β, which themselves are Ca2+/CaM-activated; (ii) binding of Ca2+/CaM to CaMKI promoting efficient phosphorylation of CaMKI by the CaMKKs; and (iii) direct allosteric activation of CaMKI by Ca2+/CaM (Refs. 25.Edelman A.M.

Whereas the rationale for such an elaborate scheme for regulation by [Ca2+]i is not immediately apparent, it may be speculated that inappropriate (i.e. Ca2+/CaM-independent) expression of CaMKI activity may be deleterious to the cell, an idea consistent with the observation that expression of a hyperactive mutant of CaMKI in Schizosaccharomycespombe resulted in cell cycle arrest (Ref. 23.Rasmussen C.D. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 685-690Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar; similarly observed with the CaMKI/IV homologue from Aspergillus nidulans) (28.Joseph J.D. Means A.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 38230-38238Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). To detect potential intracellular targets of CaMKI and thereby gain insight into its cellular role(s), we screened a cDNA expression library using solid phase in situ phosphorylation (the “phosphorylation screening” method developed by Fukunaga and Hunter (29.Fukunaga R. Hunter T. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 1921-1933Crossref PubMed Scopus (558) Google Scholar)). Using this method, we identify as potential CaMKI targets, 6-phosphofructo-2-kinase/fructose 2,6-bisphosphatase and eukaryotic translation initiation factor (eIF) 4GII (30.Gradi A. Imataka H. Svitkin Y.V. Rom E. Raught B. Morino S. Sonenberg N. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 334-342Crossref PubMed Scopus (249) Google Scholar). We further show that eIF4GII is an effective in vitro CaMKI substrate and also an in vivo target of [Ca2+]i-dependent and CaMKI-catalyzed phosphorylation. These results demonstrate phosphorylation screening to be an effective method for identifying intracellular targets of protein kinases, generalizable to the CaMK family, and have potentially revealed a new role for [Ca2+]i in the control of the initiation of mRNA translation.

The equivalent segments encoding amino acid residues 590–1451 of eIF4GII WT and S1156A mutant cDNAs were amplified by PCR and subcloned into pET30a(+) (Novagen). Proper construction of all plasmids was confirmed by sequencing. Bacterial Expression and Purification of Recombinant Proteins— CaMKI(WT) and CaMKKβ were expressed in Escherichia coli strain BL21 as GST and MBP fusion proteins, respectively, and were affinity-purified as previously described (26.Haribabu B.

Phosphorylation Screening of a Human Lung cDNA Expression Library—E. coli XL1-Blue cells were infected with a human lung cDNA library directionally constructed in λTriplEx™ (Clontech) and plated at 1.2 × 104 plaque-forming units/150-mm plate. After a 3–5-h growth period at 42 °C, the plates were overlaid with isopropyl-β-d-thiogalactopyranoside-saturated nitrocellulose filters and incubated at 37 °C for an additional 6–10 h. The filters were removed and immersed in 200 ml of blocking buffer (20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 150 mm NaCl, 3% BSA) and gently agitated for 60 min at room temperature (or overnight at 4 °C). The filters were washed 4 × 15 min in a Triton X-100 containing wash buffer (20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 0.5% Triton X-100, 1 mm DTT, and 0.2 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride) followed by rinsing for 10 min in CaMKI reaction buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 0.5 mm DTT, 10 mm MgCl2, 0.5 mg/ml BSA, 1 mm CaCl2). The filters were then incubated for 60 min at room temperature in CaMKI reaction buffer containing 25 μm unlabeled ATP and then rinsed for 10 min in this buffer without ATP. 2This step was used (29.Fukunaga R. Hunter T. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 1921-1933Crossref PubMed Scopus (558) Google Scholar) to block the ability of ATP-binding proteins to become labeled by [γ-32P]ATP included in the CaMKI reaction as well as to prevent expressed protein kinases from incorporating 32P by allowing their autophosphorylation in the presence of unlabeled ATP. GST-CaMKI 3The isoform used for screening is the ubiquitously expressed form CaMKIα, which, based on differential immunoreactivities to CaMKI isotype-specific antibodies (A. M. Edelman, E. G. Goldstein, and M. Oberdoerster, unpublished results), is equivalent to the tissue-purified form originally designated CaMKIa (74.DeRemer M.F. Saeli R.J. Edelman A.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 13460-13465Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). By the same criteria, the form termed CaMKIb appears to be a mixture of CaMKIβ and γ (37.Yokokura H. Terada O. Naito Y.

(2.0 μm) was preincubated with 1.3 μm MBP-CaMKKβ for 20 min at room temperature in a buffer containing 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.6, 0.5 mm DTT, 10 mm MgCl2, 0.5 mg/ml BSA, 1 mm CaCl2, 10 μm CaM, and 200 μm ATP. The CaMKI/CaMKK ratio used was established in preliminary experiments to yield maximal CaMKI activation, determined as previously described (35.Lee J.C. Edelman A.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 2158-2164Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) (data not shown). The activated CaMKI was diluted in CaMKI reaction buffer and [γ-32P]ATP to achieve final concentrations in the complete CaMKI reaction mixture of 0.2 μm GST-CaMKI, 0.13 μm MBP-CaMKKβ, 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.6, 0.5 mm DTT, 10 mm MgCl2, 0.5 mg/ml BSA, 1 mm CaCl2, 4 μm CaM, and 25 μm [γ-32P]ATP (6 μCi/ml), and the expressed proteins were phosphorylated by incubation of filters in this mixture for 30 min at room temperature. The filters were then washed extensively in CaMKI wash buffer (20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, 10 mm EDTA, 1 mm EGTA, 20 mm NaF, 10 mm NaPPi, and 0.1% Triton X-100). The filters were air-dried for 45 min and exposed to x-ray film for 12–48 h at –70 °C. Secondary and tertiary screens were performed as above to obtain well isolated positive plaques. The purified λTriplEx clones were converted to pTriplEx clones by Cre-Lox-mediated subcloning following the manufacturer's instructions. The inserts were sized by restriction mapping and sequenced in either the 5′ or 5′ and 3′ directions using an ABI automated DNA sequencer. Transfection of HEK 293T Cells—The cells were plated at 5.6 × 106 cells/100-mm dish and grown overnight to 80–90% confluency in a 37 °C and 5% CO2 incubator in DMEM with 10% fetal bovine serum without antibiotics. The cells were transfected with plasmids using LipofectAMINE 2000™ according to the standard protocol provided by the manufacturer. Transfection efficiency, determined using a LacZ reporter, was 70.0 ± 7.1% (S.E., n = 4). Following transfection, the cells were returned to the incubator for 24–48 h, at which point replicate dishes were either subjected to manipulation of [Ca2+]i followed by immunoprecipitation and phosphorylation or to immunoblotting to determine the relative expression levels. Manipulation of [Ca2+]i—After the period of expression, the transfected cells were washed twice with 10 ml of prewarmed serum-free DMEM and placed in a 37 °C and 5% CO2 incubator for 15 min in 5 ml of serum-free DMEM containing 3 mm EGTA and 0.1–1 μm ionomycin. Either replicate dishes were maintained under these conditions for another 30 min (minus Ca2+), or the media were changed to serum-free DMEM containing 2 mm Ca2+ and 0.1–1 μm ionomycin (plus Ca2+); then the dishes incubated for 30 min as above. Antibodies and Related Reagents—Horseradish peroxidase-conjugated goat anti-rabbit IgG and horseradish peroxidase-conjugated donkey anti-goat IgG were purchased from Jackson ImmunoResearch Laboratories Inc. Anti-FLAG M2-Biotin was obtained from Sigma. Anti-HA (Y-11) was from Santa Cruz Biotechnology. Streptavidin-horseradish peroxidase was from Invitrogen. Protein A-Sepharose was purchased from Amersham Biosciences. A polyclonal antibody to eIF4GII was described previously (32.Imataka H. Olsen H.S. Sonenberg N. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 817-825Crossref PubMed Scopus (169) Google Scholar, 34.Raught B. Gingras A.-C. Gygi S.P. Imataka H. Morino S. Gradi A. Aebersold R. Sonenberg N. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 434-444Crossref PubMed Scopus (228) Google Scholar). Immunoprecipitation—The cells were rinsed with PBS twice at room temperature, and the plates were placed on ice. All of the subsequent steps were performed at 4 °C. The cells were lysed for 15–30 min in lysis buffer (immunoprecipitation buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, 5 mm EGTA, and 5 mm EDTA), 1% Triton X-100, 1% protease inhibitor mixture (Sigma), 2 mm DTT, 1 mm sodium orthovanadate, 200 nm okadaic acid, 25 mm NaF, and 10 mm NaPPi) and then microcentrifuged at top speed for 10 min. Supernatants, precleared with protein A-Sepharose, containing 1 mg total protein were incubated with primary antibodies (1:100 anti-HA or 1:250 anti-eIF4GII) in lysis buffer overnight. Immunocomplexes were pelleted by incubation with 3 mg of protein A-Sepharose for 60 min followed by microcentrifugation for 5 s. The immunoprecipitation pellets were washed with 2 × 0.5 ml of lysis buffer, 2 × 0.5 ml of immunoprecipitation buffer, and 1 × 0.5 ml of 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5. Phosphorylation of Immunoprecipitated Proteins—To prepare 32P-labeled eIF4GII for peptide mapping experiments (described below) or assay eIF4GII phosphorylation at CaMKI sites in vivo by “back phosphorylation” (described under “Results”), the following standard procedure was employed. Immunoprecipitation pellets (prepared as described above) were incubated for 30 min at room temperature in reactions (30 μl of total volume) containing (in final concentrations) 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.6, 0.5 mm DTT, 10 mm MgCl2, 25 μm [γ-32P]ATP (5 μCi/ml), 0.5 mg/ml BSA, 1 mm CaCl2, 4 μm CaM, 0.2 μm GST-CaMKI (activated by preincubation for 20 min at room temperature using the CaMKI/CaMKK ratio established to yield maximal activation; see above) and MBP-CaMKKβ (0.13 μm, residual from the preincubation). The reactions were stopped by the addition of 30 μl of 2× SDS dissociation buffer, heating at 95 °C for 5 min, and brief centrifugation. The supernatants were subjected to SDS-PAGE, and phosphorylation was analyzed by autoradiography or phosphorimaging as indicated in figure legends. The concentration of CaMKI utilized was determined in preliminary experiments to maximally phosphorylate immunoprecipitated eIF4GII under these conditions (data not shown) so that in back phosphorylation experiments (see Figs. 5 and 6), signal intensity is inversely proportional to the degree of in vivo eIF4GII phosphorylation.Fig. 6[Ca2+]i-dependent, CaMKI-site specific eIF4GII phosphorylation is blocked by kinase negative CaMKI in 293T cells. [Ca2+]i was manipulated by ionomycin treatment followed by either 3 mm EGTA (–) or 2 mm Ca2+ (+) as indicated and described under “Experimental Procedures” in 293T cells expressing HA-eIF4GII. The cells were co-transfected with either empty vector, FLAG-CaMKI(WT), or FLAG-CaMKI(K49A) (Kin–). The cellular lysates were prepared, immunoprecipitated using anti-HA antibodies, and phosphorylated in vitro by CaMKI, and the level of back phosphorylation was analyzed by SDS-PAGE and autoradiography. The cellular lysates were electrophoresed on separate gels, and the protein expression levels were analyzed by Western blotting using either anti-FLAG or anti-HA antibodies as indicated.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Western Blotting and Tryptic Phosphopeptide Mapping—The cellular lysates were subjected to SDS-PAGE and electrophoretically transferred at 100 V for 1.5 h to a polyvinylidene difluoride membrane. The membrane was blocked overnight at 4 °C in 5% nonfat dry milk with PBST (PBS with 0.05% Tween 20), washed 2× with PBST, and incubated for 1 h at room temperature in 5% nonfat dry milk/PBST containing primary antibodies (1:1000 anti-HA or 1:1500 anti-FLAG). The membrane was washed 5 × 5 min in PBST and then incubated in the appropriate horseradish peroxidase-linked secondary antibody for 1 h at room temperature. Following washing 5 × 5 min with PBST, immunoreactive bands were detected by ECL. ATP pools of nontransfected 293T cells were metabolically labeled using 32Pi, and endogenous eIF4GII was immunoprecipitated and subjected to two-dimensional tryptic phosphopeptide mapping as previously described (34.Raught B. Gingras A.-C. Gygi S.P. Imataka H. Morino S. Gradi A. Aebersold R. Sonenberg N. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 434-444Crossref PubMed Scopus (228) Google Scholar). Kinetic and Phosphorylation Site Analysis—To determine kinetic parameters (Km, kcat), GST-CaMKI (activated by preincubation with MBP-CaMKKβ) was incubated with varying concentrations of bacterially expressed, affinity-purified HIS-eIF4GII(590–1451). Given its low Km (1 μm; see under “Results”), the reaction conditions were modified from those described under “Phosphorylation of Immunoprecipitated Proteins” as follows. The reaction times were reduced to 3–6 min, and the final concentrations of CaMKI and ATP were 1 nm and 200 μm, respectively. Under these conditions the initial rates were linear even at the lowest substrate concentration (25 nm). Following the reactions, eIF4GII was subjected to SDS-PAGE and excised from the gel, and its 32P incorporation was quantified by liquid scintillation spectrometry. Kinetic parameters (Km, kcat) were determined by nonlinear fit to the Michaelis-Menten equation. Comparison of the phosphorylation of HIS-eIF4GII(590–1451) WT and (S1156A) mutant proteins was as above at fixed substrate concentrations of 50 μg/ml of both, followed by SDS-PAGE and autoradiography. Stoichiometry of phosphorylation was calculated from the time course of 32P incorporation into HIS-eIF4GII(590–1451) by fit to the first order rate equation. Nonlinear curve fitting was performed using the program Enzfitter (Elsevier, BioSoft). As defined through the use of synthetic peptides, CaMKI has an optimal consensus sequence for substrate recognition of Hyd-Xaa-Arg-Xaa-Xaa-Ser*/Thr*-Xaa-Xaa-Xaa-Hyd (8.Lee J.C. Kwon Y.-G. Lawrence D.S. Edelman A.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 6413-6417Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). The highly degenerate nature of this motif, typical of other CaMKs and of protein kinases in general (Ref. 10.White R.R. Kwon Y.-G. Taing M. Lawrence D.S. Edelman A.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 3166-3172Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar and references therein) precludes its use as an efficient mechanism for identifying substrates by direct search of protein data bases. The excessive numbers of hits generated in such a search (>500), 4A. M. Edelman, unpublished results. many of which are undoubtedly false positives, may in part be due to instances of identification of the site in a deduced sequence but located in a region of the protein not normally accessible to the kinase because of higher order protein structural determinants. The phosphorylation screening method (29.Fukunaga R. Hunter T. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 1921-1933Crossref PubMed Scopus (558) Google Scholar) can potentially circumvent this obstacle in that, in principle, it should allow the probing kinase to select its most kinetically favorable substrates from all proteins expressed in the cell or tissue type from which the library is constructed. Prior to its application for the purpose of identifying CaMKI substrates, we modified the original phosphorylation screening method (29.Fukunaga R. Hunter T. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 1921-1933Crossref PubMed Scopus (558) Google Scholar) in several ways. First, the method, to our knowledge has only been applied twice (29.Fukunaga R. Hunter T. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 1921-1933Crossref PubMed Scopus (558) Google Scholar, 36.Obata T. Yaffe M.B. Leparc G.G. Piro E.T. Maegawa H. Kashiwagi A. Kikkawa R. Cantley L.C. J. Biol.

Hunter T. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 1921-1933Crossref PubMed Scopus (558) Google Scholar). However, in principle it should be applicable to any cDNA library prepared from a tissue in which substrates for a particular protein kinase are expected to be expressed, and because CaMKI is abundantly expressed in lung, we used instead of the HeLa cell/λGEX5 library a human lung cDNA library construct"
https://openalex.org/W1999815405,"The PAK family kinase, Shk1, is an essential regulator of polarized growth in the fission yeast, Schizosaccharomyces pombe. Here we describe the characterization of a novel member of the RhoGAP family, Rga8, identified from a two-hybrid screen for proteins that interact with the Shk1 kinase domain. Although deletion of the rga8 gene in wild type S. pombe cells results in no obvious phenotypic defects under normal growth conditions, it partially suppresses the cold-sensitive growth and morphological defects of S. pombe cells carrying a hypomorphic allele of the shk1 gene. By contrast, overexpression of rga8 is lethal to shk1-defective cells and causes morphological and cytokinesis defects in wild type S. pombe cells. Consistent with a role for Rga8 as a downstream target of Shk1, we show that the Rga8 protein is directly phosphorylated by Shk1 in vitro and phosphorylated in a Shk1-dependent fashion in S. pombe cells. Fluorescence photomicroscopy of the GFP-Rga8 fusion protein indicates that Rga8 is localized to the cell ends during interphase and to the septum-forming region during cytokinesis. In S. pombe cells carrying the orb2–34 allele of shk1, Rga8 exhibits a monopolar pattern of localization, providing evidence that Shk1 contributes to the regulation of Rga8 localization. Although molecular analyses suggest that Rga8 functions as a GAP for the S. pombe Rho1 GTPase, genetic experiments suggest that Rga8 and Rho1 have a positive functional interaction and that gain of Rho1 function, like gain of Rga8 function, is lethal to Shk1-defective cells. Our results suggest that Rga8 is a Shk1 substrate that negatively regulates Shk1-dependent growth control pathway(s) in S. pombe, potentially through interaction with the Rho1 GTPase.

Although substantial insights have been obtained relating to the molecular regulation of Shk1, relatively little is known about its downstream effector pathways. Genetic data suggest that Shk1 acts upstream of a Ras1-dependent mitogen-activated protein kinase pathway required for sexual differentiation of S. pombe cells (4.Marcus S. Polverino A. Chang E.

The results of genetic experiments suggest that Tea1 may contribute to the mediation of multiple Shk1 functions in S. pombe (23.Kim H. Yang P. Catanuto P. Verde F. Lai H. Du H. Chang F. Marcus S. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 30074-30082Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). However, because Tea1 is a nonessential protein (33.Mata J. Nurse P. Cell. 1997; 89: 939-949Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (304) Google Scholar), it cannot be the sole Shk1 effector in S. pombe. To identify potential Shk1 substrates, we carried out a two-hybrid screen to identify proteins that interact with the Shk1 catalytic domain (20.Kim H. Yang P. Qyang Y. Lai H. Du H. Henkel J.S.

Here we report on the genetic and molecular characterization of a Shk1 substrate isolated from this screen, the novel Rho GTPase-activating protein (RhoGAP) family protein, Rga8. Yeast Strains, Manipulations, and Analysis—S. pombe strains used for this study were SP870 (h90 ade6–210 leu1–32 ura4-D18), SP870D (h90 ade6–210 leu1–32 ura4-D18/h90 ade-210 leu1–32 ura4-D18), orb2–34 (h+ade6–210 leu1–32 orb2–34), nmt1-shk1K415R (h90 shk1:: ura4::nmt1-shk1K415R-ADE2 ade6–210 leu1–32 ura4-D18), SPRGA8U (h90 ade-210 leu1–32 ura4-D18 rga8::ura4), nmt1-shk1K415R rga8Δ (h90 ade6–210 leu1–32 ura4-D18 rga8::ura4 shk1::ura4::nmt1-shk1K415R-ADE2), SP90TEA1U (h90 tea1::ura4 ade6–210 leu1–32 ura4-D18), cdc10–129 (h–cdc10–129 leu1–32), and 167 (h+leu1–32 ura4-D18 cdc25–22). The rga8::ura4 strain, SPRGA8U, was constructed by transformation of SP870D with a 2.6-kb ClaI-PstI fragment of rga8::ura4 isolated from the plasmid pBSIIrga8::ura4. Diploid transformants carrying a single disrupted and a single wild type copy of rga8 were identified by Southern blot analysis and rga8::ura4 transformants were isolated by tetrad dissection. nmt1-shk1K415R rga8Δ mutants were generated by mating and subsequent tetrad dissection of nmt-shk1K415R and SPRGA8U (rga8::ura4) strains. Saccharomyces cerevisiae strains HF7c (MATa ade2–101 his3–200 leu2–3, 112 lys2–801 trp1–901 ura3–52 gal4–542 gal80–538 LYS2:: GAL1UAS-GAL1TATA-HIS3 URA3::GAL417mer(x3)-CYC1TATA-lacZ) and L40 (MATa ade2 his3 leu2 trp1 LYS2::lexA-HIS3 URA3::lexA-lacZ) were used as hosts for two-hybrid experiments.

The PCR was used to amplify shk1 sequences encoding amino acid residues 1–380 for cloning into pLEXA, generating the plasmid pLBDShk1-(1–380), and residues 145–380 for cloning into pRP259, generating pGSTShk1-(145–380). PCR was also used to amplify the rho1 protein coding sequence for construction of the plasmids pGADRho1, pREP1Rho1, and pAAUCMRho1. pGADRga8 was isolated from the two-hybrid screen for Shk1ΔN307 interacting proteins. The primer pair 5′-TTAATTGTACCATCGATCCAACCA and 5′-CAAACTCGAGTAACTGATCATCGGA was used to amplify a 3-kb fragment of the rga8 gene from S. pombe genomic DNA. This fragment was digested with ClaI and PstI and cloned into the corresponding sites of pBluescript II, producing pBSIIrga8. pBSIIrga8 was digested with HindIII and ligated to a 1.8-kb HindIII fragment of the ura4 gene to produce pBSIIrga8::ura4. pGBDRga8 was constructed by cloning a 2.5-kb BamHI-XhoI fragment of the rga8 cDNA from pGADRga8 to a BamHI-SalI fragment of pHP5. A 2.7-kb BamHI-NaeI fragment of pGBDRga8 was cloned into the BamHI and Ecl136II sites of pREP1 to produce pREP1Rga8. pAAUCMRga8, pAAUGSTRga8 and pRP259Rga8 were constructed by cloning a 2.5-kb BamHI-KpnI fragment of rga8 from pGADRga8 into the corresponding sites of pAAUCM, pAAUGST, and pRP259, respectively. pART1CMRga8, pREP4XHARga8, and pREP41Rga8 were made by cloning a 2.5-kb BamHI-SacI fragment of rga8 isolated from pAAUCMRga8 into the corresponding sites of pART1CM, pSLF173, and pREP41GFP, respectively. β-Galactosidase Filter Assay for Two-hybrid Interactions—The filter assay for testing two-hybrid interactions was performed as described previously (42.Van Aelst L.

S. pombe wild type cells co-transformed with pART1CMShk1ΔN118 together with either pAAUGST (for expression of GST) or pAAUGSTRga8 (for expression of GST-Rga8) were grown to early log phase. Cell lysates were prepared using glass beads as described previously (29.Yang P. Pimental R. Lai H. Marcus S. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 36052-36057Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). GST complexes were purified from cell lysates (1 mg of total protein) using glutathione-agarose beads (Amersham Biosciences) and resolved by SDS-PAGE and subsequent immunoblot analyses. Assay for Detection of Activated (GTP-bound) Rho1 and Cdc42 Proteins—The procedure for detecting GTP-bound forms of Rho1 and Cdc42 in S. pombe cells was performed using the strategy described by Taylor and Shalloway (43.Taylor S.J. Shalloway D. Curr. Biol. 1996; 6: 1621-1627Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (352) Google Scholar) for the detection of GTP-bound Ras proteins in mammalian cells. GST-ROCK-(831–1010)), expressed from the plasmid pGSTROCK-(831–1010) (38.Alberts A.S. Bouquin N. Johnston L.H. Treisman R. J. Biol.

In preliminary experiments, we determined that purified GST-ROCK-(831–1010) binds to recombinant Rho-GTP, but not to Rho1-GDP, and that GST-Shk1-(145–380) binds to Cdc42-GTP, but not to Cdc42-GDP, in in vitro pull-down assays (data not shown). Cultures of S. pombe cells transformed with pAAUCMRho1, for expression of c-myc epitope-tagged Rho1 (CMRho1), or pALUCdc42, for expression hemagglutinin-tagged Cdc42 (HACdc42), together with either pREP1 or pREP1Rga8, for overexpression of rho1, were washed with YLSB (43.Taylor S.J.

The cells were lysed using glass beads as described (29.Yang P. Pimental R. Lai H. Marcus S. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 36052-36057Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). The lysates (1 mg of total protein) were incubated with glutathione-agarose beads bound to GST-ROCK-(831–1010) (for purification of Rho1-GTP), GST-Shk1-(145–380) (for purification of Cdc42-GTP), or GST (negative control) for 30 min 4°C. In addition, an equivalent portion of each extract was used for immunoprecipitation of total CMRho1 (using anti-c-myc antibody 9E10 (44.Evan G.I. Lewis G.K. Ramsay G. Bishop J.M. Mol. Cell.

The beads were washed three times with YLSB, resuspended in 30 μl of SDS-PAGE sample buffer, and incubated at 95 °C for 5 min. GST and immune complexes were resolved by SDS-PAGE and subsequent immunoblot analysis to detect bound CMRho1 and HACdc42 proteins. In Vitro Kinase Assays and in Vivo Labeling Experiments—In vitro kinase assays were performed with bacterially purified proteins as described (29.Yang P. Pimental R. Lai H. Marcus S. J. Biol.

In contrast, relatively little attention has been given to mechanisms regulating the expression of the coregulator proteins themselves. Previously we have shown that the ligand-dependent corepressor, RIP140, is a direct transcriptional target of all-trans retinoic acid (RA). Here we demonstrate that RA induction of RIP140 constitutes a rate-limiting step in the regulation of retinoic acid receptor signaling. Silencing of the RA induction of RIP140 dramatically enhances and accelerates retinoid receptor transactivation, endogenous expression of other RA target genes, and RA-induced neuronal differentiation and cell cycle arrest in human embryonal carcinoma cells. The data suggest that RA induction of RIP140 constitutes a functional negative feedback loop that limits activation of retinoid receptors in the continued presence of RA and that acutely regulated expression of coregulators may be a general regulatory mechanism in hormonal signaling.

The data suggest that RA induction of RIP140 constitutes a functional negative feedback loop that limits activation of retinoid receptors in the continued presence of RA and that acutely regulated expression of coregulators may be a general regulatory mechanism in hormonal signaling. Retinoids are ligands for retinoid receptors, which are members of the steroid receptor superfamily (1Mangelsdorf D.J. Umesono K. Evans R.M. Sporn M.B. Roberts A.B. Goodman D.S.

Detailed molecular mechanisms have been elucidated whereby acetylation, methylation, and phosphorylation of specific histone tail residues by coregulatory complexes regulate the transcriptional activity of nuclear receptors (3Gamble M.J.

Corepressors N-CoR and SMRT, through direct interaction with the AF-2 domain of nuclear receptors, actively repress transcription in the absence of ligand (6Horlein A.J. Naar A.M. Heinzel T.

LXXLL motifs present in coactivators SRC-1, TIF2, and AIB1 are essential for hormone-dependent interaction with nuclear receptors (8Heery D.M. Kalkhoven E. Hoare S. Parker M.G. Nature. 1997; 387: 733-736Crossref PubMed Scopus (1778) Google Scholar). Receptor-interacting protein 140 (RIP140) is one of the most enigmatic nuclear receptor coregulators (9Parker M.G. Leonardsson G. White R. Steel J. Milligan S. FEBS Lett. 2003; 546: 149-153Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar). RIP140 contains 10 LXXLL motifs and interacts preferentially with nuclear receptors in the presence of ligand (10Cavailles V. Dauvois S. L'Horset F. Lopez G. Hoare S. Kushner P.J. Parker M.G. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 3741-3751Crossref PubMed Scopus (673) Google Scholar). However, RIP140 inhibits the transactivation function of ligand bound receptors, including retinoid receptors (11Lee C.H.

This property sets RIP140 apart from classic corepressors such as N-CoR and SMRT, which repress apo-receptors, as well as classic coactivators, such as SRC-1, which bind and activate holo-receptors (3Gamble M.J. Freedman L P. Trends Biochem. Sci. 2002; 27: 165-167Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar, 4McKenna N.J. O'Malley B.W.

Metab. 2002; 13: 55-60Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (291) Google Scholar). RIP140 has intrinsic repression activity when fused to the Gal4-DNA binding domain and directly recruits histone deacetylases and the transcriptional repressor, CtBP (C-terminal-binding protein), to nuclear receptors (16Wei L.N.

Biol. 2001; 21: 6181-6188Crossref PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar). Thus RIP140 is predicted to suppress target gene expression of agonist-bound hormone receptors. Utilizing expression array profiling we discovered that RIP140 is itself an immediate RA target gene (18Freemantle S.J. Kerley J.S. Olsen S.L. Gross R.H. Spinella M.J. Oncogene. 2002; 21: 2880-2889Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar, 19Kerley J.S. Olsen S.L. Freemantle S.J. Spinella M.J. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2001; 285: 969-975Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). Induction of RIP140 mRNA occurs within 3 h and induction of its protein within 6 h (19Kerley J.S. Olsen S.L. Freemantle S.J. Spinella M.J. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2001; 285: 969-975Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). The RA induction of RIP140 mRNA does not require de novo protein synthesis, consistent with RIP140 being a direct transcriptional target of retinoid receptors (19Kerley J.S. Olsen S.L. Freemantle S.J. Spinella M.J. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2001; 285: 969-975Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). A promoter fragment of RIP140 contains a near consensus DR5 RARE and is activated by RA (19Kerley J.S. Olsen S.L. Freemantle S.J. Spinella M.J. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2001; 285: 969-975Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). The current study utilizes the embryonal carcinoma cell line NT2/D1 as a model of RA-induced differentiation (20Spinella M.J. Kerley J.S White K.A. Curtin J.C. J. Nutr. 2003; 133: 273S-276SCrossref PubMed Google Scholar) and proposes that RA induction of RIP140 serves as a negative feedback signal limiting RA activity at the level of nuclear receptor coregulation. Transient Transfection Reporter Assays—NT2/D1 is a clonal line derived from a xenograft of Tera-2 cells (21Andrews P.W. Acta Pathol. Microbiol. Immunol. Scand. 1998; 106: 158-168Crossref PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar). The reporters, RARE-TK-Luc and RARβ2-Luc were described previously (22Curtin J.C. Dragnev K.H. Sekula D. Christie A.J Dmitrovsky E. Spinella M.J. Oncogene. 2001; 20: 2559-2569Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). 1.75 × 10 5 cells/well of a 6-well plate were transfected with 2.75 μg of DNA including 0.75 μg of reporter plasmid, 1.5 μg of expression plasmid, and 0.5 μg of a β-actin-β-galactosidase expression plasmid using a modified calcium phosphate precipitation technique (22Curtin J.C. Dragnev K.H. Sekula D. Christie A.J Dmitrovsky E. Spinella M.J. Oncogene. 2001; 20: 2559-2569Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). Cells were exposed to precipitates for 14–16 h and then washed and cultured with or without 1 μm RA for an additional 48 h before harvesting. For siRNA, 0.75 μg of RARE-TK-Luc, 0.5 μg of β-actin-β-galactosidase expression plasmid, and indicated amounts of siRNA were co-transfected using Polyfect (Qiagen). Luciferase activities were measured and normalized to β-galactosidase activity as described (22Curtin J.C. Dragnev K.H. Sekula D. Christie A.J Dmitrovsky E. Spinella M.J. Oncogene. 2001; 20: 2559-2569Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). Data points represent the average of triplicate transfections with similar results obtained in at least three independent experiments. SiRNA—The sequence of the custom siRNA duplex for RIP140 corresponds to the human RIP140 cDNA starting 331 bp downstream of the ATG start codon (Dharmacon). The siRNA duplex control used was the Scramble II sequence from Dharmacon. Transfection of siRNA was performed with OligofectAMINE Reagent (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's instructions. The final concentration of siRNA used in each experiment was ∼150 nm. In independent experiments, transfection efficiency was assessed to be greater than 90% using fluorescein-labeled siRNA (Dharmacon). Immunophenotypic and Cell Cycle Analysis—Indirect fluorescence-activated cell sorter (FACS) analysis to evaluate RA-induced neuronal differentiation of NT2/D1 cells was performed using established techniques (23Spinella M.J. Freemantle S.J. Sekula D. Chang J.H. Christie A.J. Dmitrovsky E. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 22013-22018Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar). Briefly, NT2/D1 cells were incubated with a monoclonal antibody to the cell surface antigen A2B5 or an isotype-matched monoclonal control antibody. Cells were assayed indirectly with fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated goat-anti-mouse antibody, and fluorescence was measured as described (23Spinella M.J. Freemantle S.J. Sekula D. Chang J.H. Christie A.J. Dmitrovsky E. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 22013-22018Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar). Mean peak fluorescent values and the percentage of positive cells were measured. For cell cycle phase analysis, cells were fixed with 70% ethanol and stained with propidium iodide for 16 h. The percentages of cells in G1, S, and G2/M were then determined on a BD Biosciences FACscan flow cytometer using Modfit LT software and established techniques (23Spinella M.J. Freemantle S.J. Sekula D. Chang J.H. Christie A.J. Dmitrovsky E. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 22013-22018Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar). Northern, RT-PCR, and Heteronuclear-PCR (hn-PCR) Analyses— Total RNA was isolated using TriReagent (Invitrogen). Northern hybridizations were performed as described previously (19Kerley J.S. Olsen S.L. Freemantle S.J. Spinella M.J. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2001; 285: 969-975Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). Expression levels of RA targets genes were also measured by semiquantitative RT-PCR. The cDNA was synthesized from 5 μg total RNA using Superscript II reverse transcriptase (Invitrogen), as described previously (18Freemantle S.J. Kerley J.S. Olsen S.L. Gross R.H. Spinella M.J. Oncogene. 2002; 21: 2880-2889Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar, 22Curtin J.C. Dragnev K.H. Sekula D. Christie A.J Dmitrovsky E. Spinella M.J. Oncogene. 2001; 20: 2559-2569Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). Amplification of genes and β-actin was performed using Taq polymerase as described (18Freemantle S.J. Kerley J.S. Olsen S.L. Gross R.H. Spinella M.J. Oncogene. 2002; 21: 2880-2889Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar, 22Curtin J.C. Dragnev K.H. Sekula D. Christie A.J Dmitrovsky E. Spinella M.J. Oncogene. 2001; 20: 2559-2569Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). Experiments were performed to determine the optimal number of cycles that would yield linear phase of amplification, and reverse transcriptase was omitted to control for genomic DNA contamination. For certain products, detection in the linear range required transfer to nitrocellulose and probing with a radiolabeled internal primer. The sequence of PCR primers is available upon request. To detect primary, pre-spliced transcripts, hn-PCR was performed. Total RNA was first treated with DNase with the DNA-Free kit from Ambion. RT-PCR was then performed for 35 cycles as described above with primers spanning an exon-intron boundary of human CRABP2 and human CYP26A1. RIP140 Is a Rate-limiting Negative Regulator of Retinoid Receptor Transactivation—RA induces neuronal differentiation and G1 cell cycle arrest in NT2/D1 cells (21Andrews P.W. Acta Pathol. Microbiol. Immunol. Scand. 1998; 106: 158-168Crossref PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar, 23Spinella M.J. Freemantle S.J. Sekula D. Chang J.H. Christie A.J. Dmitrovsky E. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 22013-22018Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar). Our prior work identified RIP140 as acutely up-regulated upon RA treatment of NT2/D1 cells (18Freemantle S.J. Kerley J.S. Olsen S.L. Gross R.H. Spinella M.J. Oncogene. 2002; 21: 2880-2889Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar, 19Kerley J.S. Olsen S.L. Freemantle S.J. Spinella M.J. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2001; 285: 969-975Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). RIP140 is a direct transcriptional target of retinoid receptors based on rapid, cycloheximide-insensitive induction of RIP140 with RA treatment (18Freemantle S.J. Kerley J.S. Olsen S.L. Gross R.H. Spinella M.J. Oncogene. 2002; 21: 2880-2889Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar, 19Kerley J.S. Olsen S.L. Freemantle S.J. Spinella M.J. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2001; 285: 969-975Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). Because it has been reported that RIP140 can repress ligand-bound retinoid receptors (11Lee C.H. Wei L.N. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 31320-31326Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar, 12Treuter E. Albrektsen T. Johansson L. Leers J. Gustafsson J.A. Mol.

Biol. 2001; 21: 6181-6188Crossref PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar), the extent to which RA induction of RIP140 represses RA signaling was investigated. Overexpression of RIP140 greatly inhibited a RARE-containing promoter/enhancer (up to 7-fold) in a dose-dependent manner (Fig. 1A). RIP140 transfection had no effect on SV40- and CMV-driven control reporters. Further, the inhibitory effect of RIP140 occurred only in the presence of ligand, a property not shared with classic corepressors such as SMRT or N-CoR which preferentially bind and repress apo-receptors (3Gamble M.J. Freedman L P. Trends Biochem. Sci. 2002; 27: 165-167Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar, 4McKenna N.J. O'Malley B.W. Cell. 2002; 108: 465-474Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1255) Google Scholar, 5Hermanson O. Glass C.K. Rosenfeld M.G. Trends Endocrinol. Metab. 2002; 13: 55-60Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (291) Google Scholar). Because overexpression studies are susceptible to nonphysiologic effects such as squelching, siRNA was designed to repress RIP140 expression. RIP140 siRNA but not a control siRNA effectively decreased both basal and RA-induced expression of RIP140 mRNA ∼5-fold (Fig. 1C). RIP140 siRNA dramatically increased (up to 15-fold) RA-dependent RARE-TK-Luc activity in a dose-dependent manner (Fig 1B). RIP140 siRNA had no effect on basal RARE activity and control siRNA failed to stimulate RARE activity (Fig. 1B). RIP140 siRNA also failed to alter TK-, SV40-, CMV-, and β-actin-driven control reporters. Overexpressed RIP140 and RIP140 siRNA similarly affected RARE reporter activity in MCF-7 cells (data not shown). Together these data strongly indicate that RIP140, in a rate-limiting fashion, represses RARE-mediated transactivation. Inhibition of RA-induced Expression of RIP140 Enhances Expression of Endogenous RA Target Genes—As depicted in Fig. 2A, RIP140 siRNA but not control siRNA increased the endogenous expression of the known RA target genes RARβ and LEFTYA in NT2/D1 cells (18Freemantle S.J. Kerley J.S. Olsen S.L. Gross R.H. Spinella M.J. Oncogene. 2002; 21: 2880-2889Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). RIP140 siRNA failed to inhibit the expression of the nuclear receptor coregulators SRC-1 and N-CoR, which served as specificity controls (data not shown). Increased expression of RARβ and LEFTYA in response to RIP140 RNAi was apparent at 3–6 h of RA treatment, which is within the time frame of RIP140 protein induction with RA (Fig. 2A) (19Kerley J.S. Olsen S.L. Freemantle S.J. Spinella M.J. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2001; 285: 969-975Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). An increase in target gene expression of ∼6-fold was seen at 24 h of RA treatment in RIP140 siRNA cells as compared with cells treated with control siRNA. A similar pattern of expression in response to RIP140 siRNA was seen for the RA target gene HAS2 (data not shown). The effects of knocking down RIP140 expression on RA target genes was largely ligand-dependent, which supports a role for RIP140 as a ligand-dependent corepressor based on prior studies of in vitro interactions. This result supports a negative feedback model by which RA induction of RIP140 inhibits retinoid receptor activity in the continued presence of ligand. Others have shown that estrogen receptor target gene expression is phasic in the constant presence of ligand (24Chen H. Lin R.J. Xie W. Wilpitz D. Evans R.M. Cell. 1999; 98: 675-686Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (563) Google Scholar, 25Shang Y. Hu X. DiRenzo J. Lazar M.A. Brown M. Cell. 2000; 103: 843-852Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1457) Google Scholar). For ER target genes, peak transcription rate occurs within 1–3 h in the constant presence of estrogen. Thereafter the rate gradually declines over 24 h despite continued estrogen treatment (24Chen H. Lin R.J. Xie W. Wilpitz D. Evans R.M. Cell. 1999; 98: 675-686Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (563) Google Scholar). To address whether RA target genes demonstrate a similar pattern of expression and the generality of RIP140 effects on RA target gene regulation, the expression of the RA target genes CYP26A1 and CRAPB2 was measured in the continuous presence of RA in MCF-7 cells. As depicted in the top portion of Fig. 2B, total steady state levels of CRABP2 and CYP26A1 mRNA steadily increased in the continued presence of RA, and this was enhanced by RIP140 siRNA. The rate of CRAB2 and CYP26A1 expression was then measured by hn-PCR. In control cells the rate of transcription of CRABP2 and CYP26A1 peaked at 1 and 6 h of RA treatment, respectively, and then declined (Fig. 2B, bottom). Although the timing of the peak transcription rate was slightly altered by RIP140 siRNA, the major effect was an abrogation of the decline in transcription rate, which occurred in control cells at the later time points. In RIP140 siRNA cells, the rate for CRABP2 held steady at 8 and 24 h of RA treatment, although the decline at 6 h was still present suggesting that other mechanisms of attenuation independent of RIP140 occur at this earlier time point for CRABP2. In RIP140 siRNA cells the transcription rate for CYP26A1 continued to increase through 6, 8, and 24 h of RA treatment (Fig. 2B, bottom). These data indicate that the greater accumulation of total RA target gene mRNA by RIP140 siRNA is not due primarily to an increase in transcription rate per se but rather is due to a prolongation of peak transcription rate. These data indicate that like the estrogen receptor, retinoid receptors also mediate phasic transactivational activity in the constant presence of cognate ligand, and supports a role for RIP140 in this process. Inhibition of RA-induced Expression of RIP140 Accelerates Differentiation and G1 Cell Cycle Arrest—The data thus far indicate that inhibiting RA induction of RIP140 increases retinoid receptor transactivation and RA target gene expression. The effects of perturbing RIP140 expression on RA-induced differentiation and G1 arrest were studied. Remarkably, RIP140 siRNA but not a control siRNA accelerated the time course of RA-induced neuronal differentiation as assayed by the neuroectodermal marker A2B5 (Fig. 3, A and B). We have previously demonstrated that 1 μm RA treatment maximally induces expression of A2B5 within 5 days (23Spinella M.J. Freemantle S.J. Sekula D. Chang J.H. Christie A.J. Dmitrovsky E. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 22013-22018Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar). At 2 and 3 days of RA treatment, control siRNA cells were essentially A2B5-negative. In contrast, substantial RA-induced A2B5 expression was seen in RIP140 siRNA cells within 2 days. The maximal differential effect of RIP140 siRNA was at 3 days of RA treatment, where values for mean fluorescence and percent positive cells were 460 and 57%, respectively, for RIP140 siRNA-treated cells versus 88 and 17.6%, respectively for control siRNA (Fig. 3B). Likewise, accelerated loss of expression of the stem cell marker SSEA3 was seen upon RA treatment of RIP140 siRNA-transfected cells as compared with controls (data not shown). G1 cell cycle arrest is closely associated with RA-induced differentiation of NT2/D1 cells (23Spinella M.J. Freemantle S.J. Sekula D. Chang J.H. Christie A.J. Dmitrovsky E. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 22013-22018Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar). RIP140 siRNA also accelerated RA-induced G1 arrest in NT2/D1 cells at 2 and 3 days of RA treatment as compared with controls (Fig. 3C). Together, these data indicate that RIP140 is rate-limiting for repressing ligand-dependent receptor transactivation, endogenous RA target gene expression, and RA-induced differentiation in NT2/D1 cells. Models have been proposed to explain the self-limitation of transcriptional activation by nuclear receptors. Chen et al. (24Chen H. Lin R.J. Xie W. Wilpitz D. Evans R.M. Cell. 1999; 98: 675-686Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (563) Google Scholar) reported that the rate of estrogen receptor target gene expression peaks early in response to estrogen and gradually declines over 24 h in the constant presence of ligand. This correlated with transient formation of co-activator complexes on estrogen target gene promoters (24Chen H. Lin R.J. Xie W. Wilpitz D. Evans R.M. Cell. 1999; 98: 675-686Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (563) Google Scholar, 25Shang Y. Hu X. DiRenzo J. Lazar M.A. Brown M. Cell. 2000; 103: 843-852Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1457) Google Scholar). A mechanism proposed for this attenuation involved p300 acetylation of the p160 activator, ACTR (activator of thyroid and retinoic acid receptors), which led to disassembly of the coactivator complex (24Chen H. Lin R.J. Xie W. Wilpitz D. Evans R.M. Cell. 1999; 98: 675-686Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (563) Google Scholar). Thus post-translational modification is one mechanism for attenuation of nuclear receptor signaling. In contrast, relatively little attention has been given to transcriptional regulation of coregulators. Based on the current study, we propose that an additional attenuation mechanism for nuclear receptors is classical negative feedback inhibition. In this model, activated retinoid receptors induce the production of a nuclear receptor corepressor, RIP140. That RIP140 inhibits retinoid receptors in a ligand-dependent fashion is a key feature of this model. RIP140 overexpression inhibited ligand-dependent RARE promoter activity. Notably, prevention of RA induction of RIP140 via siRNA dramatically induced RARE activity and increased levels of RA target gene expression. Remarkably, RIP140 silencing also accelerated RA-induced terminal differentiation and cell cycle arrest. This indicates the novel finding that RIP140 can be a rate-limiting factor in regulating nuclear receptor activity. RIP140 is widely expressed and can inhibit distinct agonist-bound nuclear receptors (9Parker M.G. Leonardsson G. White R. Steel J. Milligan S. FEBS Lett. 2003; 546: 149-153Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar, 26Lee C.H. Chinpaisal C. Wei L.N. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 6745-6755Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar). Further RIP140 has been reported to be modestly induced by estrogen (27Thenot S. Charpin M Bonnet S. Cavailles V. Mol. Cell. Endocrinol. 1999; 156: 85-93Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). It will be important to further define the extracellular cues regulating the expression of RIP140 and other coregulators. Because RIP140, as supported here and by prior in vitro interaction and transactivation studies, may inhibit a number of agonist-bound nuclear receptors, the possibility exists that RIP140 may participate in cross-talk among distinct nuclear receptor classes and contribute to the integration of diverse hormonal signals. Based on our findings, careful analysis of the relative potency of RIP140 toward distinct nuclear receptors is warranted. Although the precise interplay between RIP140 and other coregulators in receptor regulation is unclear, RIP140 and p160 coativators have been reported to be at least partially competitive in binding nuclear receptors (12Treuter E. Albrektsen T. Johansson L. Leers J. Gustafsson J.A. Mol. Endocrinol. 1998; 12: 864-881Crossref PubMed Scopus (0) Google Scholar, 15Teyssier C. Belguise K. Galtier F. Cavailles V. Chalbos D. Mol.

Recently, the RNA helicase, DP97, and the C-terminal-binding protein CtBP, LCoR, were shown to repress nuclear receptors in a ligand-dependent fashion, suggesting that this form of corepression could be broadly engaged in diverse cells and tissues (29Rajendran R.R.

Cell. 2000; 11: 139-150Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (208) Google Scholar). In summary, these data support a straightforward model of regulatory control involving negative feedback inhibition mediated by RA induction of a ligand-dependent corepressor. We have shown that part of the coregulator machinery, RIP140, is itself a direct target of RA. This is of particular importance considering that coregulators are proposed, as demonstrated here for RIP140, to be a rate-limiting component of nuclear receptor activity. Further, we have demonstrated that RIP140 has potent effects both in modulating retinoid receptor activity and on the efficacy of retinoids to signal growth suppression and differentiation. Further studies will be required to uncover the full biological and therapeutic impact of this form of regulation."

It is caused by mutations in the Na+-dependent organic cation transporter, OCTN2. To define the domains involved in carnitine recognition, we evaluated chimeric transporters created by swapping homologous domains between OCTN1, which does not transport carnitine, and OCTN2. Substitution of the C terminus of OCTN2 (amino acid residues 342–557) with the corresponding residues of OCTN1 completely abolished carnitine transport. The progressive substitution of the N terminus of OCTN2 with OCTN1 resulted in a decrease in carnitine transport associated with a progressive increase in the Km toward carnitine from 3.9 ± 0.5 to 141 ± 19 μm. The largest drop in carnitine transport (and increase in Km toward carnitine) was observed with the substitution of residues 341–454 of OCTN2. An additional chimeric transporter (CHIM-9) in which only residues 341–454 of OCTN2 were substituted by OCTN1 had markedly reduced carnitine transport, with an elevated Km toward carnitine (63 ± 5 μm). Site-directed mutagenesis and introduction of residues nonconserved between OCTN1 and OCTN2 in the OCTN2 cDNA indicated that the R341A, L409W, L424Y, and T429I substitutions significantly decreased carnitine transport. Single substitutions did not increase the Km toward carnitine. By contrast, the combination of three of these substitutions (R341W + L409W + T429I) greatly decreased carnitine transport and increased the Km toward carnitine (20.2 ± 4.5 μm). The Arg-341, Leu-409, and Thr-429 residues are all located in predicted transmembrane domains. Involvement of these residues in carnitine transport was further supported by the partial restoration of carnitine transport by the introduction of these OCTN2 residues in the OCTN1 portion of CHIM-9. These studies indicate that multiple domains of the OCTN2 transporter are required for carnitine transport and identify transmembrane residues important for carnitine recognition.

Primary carnitine deficiency (On-line Mendelian Inheritance in Man 212140) is a recessively inherited disorder of fatty acid oxidation due to defective carnitine transport (1Scaglia F. Longo N. Semin. Perinatol. 1999; 23: 152-161Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). Carnitine is essential for the transfer of long-chain fatty acids from the cytosol to mitochondria for subsequent β oxidation and the lack of carnitine impairs the ability to use fat as fuel during periods of fasting or stress. This can result in hypoketotic hypoglycemia, Reye's syndrome, and sudden infant death in younger children or in skeletal or cardiac myopathy with insidious onset later in life (1Scaglia F. Longo N.

The corresponding human and rat genes have not yet been identified. A third carnitine transporter, CT2, was isolated from human testis (14Enomoto A. Wempe M.F. Tsuchida H. Shin H.J. Cha S.H. Anzai N.

This latter transporter has high affinity toward carnitine (Km 20 μm) but is only partially sodium-dependent (14Enomoto A. Wempe M.F. Tsuchida H. Shin H.J. Cha S.H. Anzai N. Goto A. Sakamoto A.

Finally, the amino acid transporter ATB0,+, which is unrelated to the organic cation family of membrane transporters, can transport carnitine with low affinity (Km 0.8 mm) (15Nakanishi T. Hatanaka T. Huang W. Prasad P.D. Leibach F.H. Ganapathy M.E. Ganapathy V. J. Physiol. 2001; 532: 297-304Crossref PubMed Scopus (167) Google Scholar). This transporter is expressed primarily in the lungs, mammary gland, and the intestine. This latter characteristic might explain residual intestinal carnitine transport in patients with primary carnitine deficiency (15Nakanishi T. Hatanaka T. Huang W. Prasad P.D. Leibach F.H.

Although the pharmacological and recognition properties of OCTN2 have been investigated in many systems, little is known about the domains and residues of this transporter involved in carnitine and sodium recognition. The study of natural mutations identified in patients with primary carnitine deficiency has identified domains essential for carnitine (as opposed to organic cation) transport located in transmembrane domain 11 (P478L and S467C mutations) (16Seth P.

Nezu J. Tsuji A. J. Pharmacol. Exp. Ther. 2002; 302: 1286-1294Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). This domain was proposed to contain the anionic binding site for carnitine (17Ohashi R. Tamai I. Inano A. Katsura M. Sai Y. Nezu J. Tsuji A. J. Pharmacol. Exp. Ther. 2002; 302: 1286-1294Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). Another natural mutation, E452K, located in the putative intracellular loop connecting transmembrane domains 10 and 11, was found to be important for transmembrane sodium/solute transfer (10Wang Y. Meadows T.A. Longo N. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 20782-20786Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). Mutations in this area increased the apparent Km toward extracellular sodium for carnitine transport (10Wang Y. Meadows T.A. Longo N. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 20782-20786Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). So far, no natural mutations have been found to affect the Km toward carnitine, and no systematic studies have been performed to determine the domain(s) of OCTN2 responsible for carnitine and sodium recognition and transfer. The identification of the substrate-binding site is of general significance because it might apply to the other OCTN transporters and to organic cation transporters (OCT) in general. In this paper, we have constructed chimeric transporter molecules by swapping corresponding portions of hOCTN1 and hOCTN2. Our results identify residues located in transmembrane domains 7,8, and 10 that affect the Km toward carnitine and are likely important for carnitine recognition or transfer. Cell Culture and Carnitine Transport—Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells were grown in Ham's F12 medium supplemented with 6% fetal bovine serum. Carnitine transport was measured at 37 °C with the cluster tray method as described previously (10Wang Y. Meadows T.A. Longo N. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 20782-20786Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar, 18Scaglia F. Wang Y. Longo N. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1999; 364: 99-106Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). Cells were grown to confluence in 24-well plates (Costar) and depleted of intracellular amino acids by incubation for 90 min in Earle's balanced salt solution containing 5.5 mm d-glucose and supplemented with 0.1% bovine serum albumin. Carnitine (0.5 μm, 0.5 mCi/ml) was then added to the cells for 20 min. The transport reaction was stopped by rapidly washing the cells four times with ice-cold 0.1 m MgCl2. Intracellular carnitine was normalized for intracellular water content, and transport velocity was expressed as nmol/ml cell water/h (18Scaglia F. Wang Y. Longo N. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1999; 364: 99-106Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). Saturable carnitine transport was calculated by subtracting either sodium-independent carnitine transport or carnitine transport in the presence of saturating (2 mm) cold carnitine from total transport (10Wang Y. Meadows T.A. Longo N. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 20782-20786Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar, 18Scaglia F. Wang Y. Longo N. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1999; 364: 99-106Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). The two approaches gave similar results (10Wang Y. Meadows T.A. Longo N. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 20782-20786Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). Values are reported as means ± S.E. of 3–6 independent determinations. Preliminary experiments indicated that carnitine transport is linear up to 30 min in cells expressing the normal OCTN2 transporter (10Wang Y. Meadows T.A. Longo N. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 20782-20786Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). For sodium-independent transport, methylglucamine chloride was substituted for sodium chloride in the extracellular medium (10Wang Y. Meadows T.A. Longo N. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 20782-20786Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). This solution was mixed with a similar one containing 150 mm sodium chloride to evaluate sodium stimulation of carnitine transport. Kinetic constants for carnitine transport were determined by nonlinear regression analysis according to a Michaelis-Menten equation (18Scaglia F. Wang Y. Longo N. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1999; 364: 99-106Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). Nonsaturable carnitine transport, measured in the presence of 2 mm carnitine, was subtracted from total transport to obtain saturable carnitine transport (10Wang Y. Meadows T.A. Longo N. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 20782-20786Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). Nonlinear parameters are expressed as means ± S.D. Comparisons for significance were performed using 95% (p < 0.05) or 99% (p < 0.01) confidence intervals. In previous studies (10Wang Y. Meadows T.A. Longo N. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 20782-20786Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar), we used multiple carnitine concentrations to define the Km of OCTN2 toward sodium (KNa). However, we noted that the value obtained from the intercept of multiple regressions was identical to the value obtained at the lowest concentration of carnitine (0.5 μm, Ref. 10Wang Y. Meadows T.A. Longo N. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 20782-20786Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). This is because, in a random bireactant system such as the carnitine/sodium cotransporter, the apparent Km toward the co-substrate approaches the true Km (KNa) as the concentration of the substrate (carnitine) decreases to near zero (19Segel I.H. Enzyme Kinetics. John Wiley & Son, New York1975: 274-345Google Scholar). Because our previous studies indicated experimentally that a concentration of carnitine of 0.5 μm already gave values of apparent KNa indistinguishable from those calculated from the intersection of multiple curves, in this study we used an even lower concentration of carnitine (0.1 μm) to obtain an apparent KNa that closely approaches true KNa. As shown in the results below, the values obtained with this system are similar or identical to those published previously for these cells (10Wang Y. Meadows T.A. Longo N. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 20782-20786Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). Construction of Chimeric OCTN1-OCTN2 Expression Vectors—The human OCTN2 and OCTN1 cDNAs, kindly provided by Dr. Vadivel Ganapathy, Medical College of Georgia, Augusta, were amplified by PCR using Pfu high fidelity polymerase and primers to add an EcoRI site to the 5′ and a BamHI site to the 3′ ends, as described previously for OCTN2 (10Wang Y. Meadows T.A. Longo N. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 20782-20786Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). The 3′ primer removed the physiologic STOP codon of these cDNAs. The PCR product was digested with EcoRI and BamHI and ligated in the corresponding restriction sites of pEGFP-N2 (Clontech). The resulting plasmid had the OCTN cDNAs fused in-frame with the green fluorescent protein under control of the cytomegalovirus promoter. The final vector was sequenced to exclude PCR artifacts. These plasmids were transfected into CHO cells by LipofectAMINE according to the manufacturer's instructions (Invitrogen). Cells were selected with 0.8 mg/ml G418 (Invitrogen) for 2 weeks, and resistant cells were isolated. The presence of green fluorescence was used to confirm successful transfection. For the construction of chimeric plasmids, unique restriction sites within each cDNA were identified (Fig. 1). The vector containing the unique restriction site was digested with that restriction enzyme and another restriction enzyme to delete part of the cDNA. For example, in the case of CHIM-1, the OCTN1-GFP plasmid was digested with AccB71 and BamHI. The larger fragment was retained after separation of the fragments on an agarose gel. The other cDNA, OCTN2 in the case of CHIM-1, was amplified by high fidelity polymerase using a 5′ primer, creating the unique restriction site, AccB71 in the case of CHIM-1, present in the main vector and the other restriction site, BamHI in the case of CHIM-1, at the 3′ end to allow amplification of the missing portion of the transporter. The PCR product was digested with the two enzymes (AccB71 and BamHI in the case of CHIM-1) and inserted in the compatible sites of the vector containing the remaining portion of cDNA. The resulting vector was sequenced to exclude PCR artifacts and to verify the correct in-frame fusion of the two cDNAs. The resulting plasmids were stably transfected into CHO cells using LipofectAMINE and G418 selection. Site-directed Mutagenesis—The indicated mutations were introduced by site-directed mutagenesis using the QuikChange system (Stratagene) following the manufacturer's instructions. The final plasmids were sequenced to confirm the presence of the mutation and the absence of PCR artifacts. The plasmids obtained were then transfected into CHO cells as above. Carnitine Transport by CHO Cells Transfected with Chimeric OCTN Transporters—OCTN1 and OCTN2 are highly conserved (Fig. 1). The regions less conserved are in the predicted intracellular loop between transmembrane domains 6 and 7 and the intracellular C-terminal domain (these regions are boxed in Fig. 1). Different chimeric transporters were constructed by fusing the N terminus of OCTN1 with the C terminus of OCTN2 (CHIM-1, CHIM-2, CHIM-3, CHIM-4). Mirror image of these transporters were also obtained by fusing the N terminus of OCTN2 with the C terminus of OCTN1 (CHIM-5, CHIM-6, CHIM-7, CHIM-8). The transport of carnitine (0.5 μm) increased about 50-fold in CHO cells transfected with the normal OCTN2 cDNA (Fig. 2). OCTN1 failed to cause any significant increase in carnitine transport. Carnitine transport increased >25-fold in cells expressing the chimeric transporter CHIM-1, 20-fold in cells expressing CHIM-2, 17-fold with CHIM-3, and less than 3-fold with CHIM-4. The dramatic decrease in carnitine transport in CHIM-4 as compared with CHIM-3 indicated that amino acid residues 341–453 of OCTN2 contained a domain essential for OCTN2 function. Carnitine transport increased only 4-fold in cells expressing CHIM-5, which contained the 453 N-terminal amino acids of OCTN2. No significant increase in carnitine transport was observed with CHIM-6, CHIM-7, and CHIM-8. The disappearance of carnitine transport with CHIM-6, CHIM-7, and CHIM-8 indicated that another essential domain for carnitine transport was contained in the C-terminal domain of the OCTN2 transporter, between amino acid residues 341 and 557. However, the complete disappearance of carnitine transport when residues 341–453 of OCTN2 were removed further supported an essential role of this region in carnitine transport. Kinetics of Carnitine Transport in CHO Cells Expressing Normal and Chimeric OCTN2 Transporters—To understand the mechanism underlying the decreased transport of carnitine in cells expressing CHIM-1, CHIM-2, CHIM-3, and CHIM-4, kinetic constants for carnitine (0.5–100 μm) transport were compared with those of cells expressing wild-type OCTN2 cDNA (Fig. 3). CHO cells overexpressing the OCTN2 cDNA transported carnitine with a Km of 2.9 ± 0.7 μm, in the range reported in previous studies (3Tamai I. Ohashi R. Nezu J. Yabuuchi H. Oku A. Shimane M. Sai Y. Tsuji A. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 20378-20382Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (626) Google Scholar, 10Wang Y. Meadows T.A. Longo N. J. Biol.

Mutat. 2000; 15: 238-245Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). As the N terminus of OCTN2 was substituted by OCTN1, the Km toward carnitine increased to 5.2 ± 0.8 μm (no significant change versus OCTN2) in CHIM-1, 9.8 ± 0.8 μm in CHIM-2 (p < 0.01 as compared with wild-type OCTN2 using 99% confidence intervals), 12.5 ± 0.8 μm in CHIM-3 (p < 0.01), and 141 ± 19 μm in CHIM-4 (p < 0.01). By contrast, there were only minimal changes in Vmax among most transfectants. The Vmax was 111 ± 6 nmol/ml cell water/h with OCTN2, 105 ± 4 nmol/ml cell water/h with CHIM-1 (not significantly different from OCTN2), 108 ± 2 nmol/ml cell water/h with CHIM-2 (not significantly different from OCTN2), 133 ± 4 nmol/ml cell water/h with CHIM-3 (p < 0.05 versus OCTN2), and 215 ± 20 nmol/ml cell water/h with CHIM-4 (p < 0.01 versus OCTN2). Analysis of cells expressing CHIM-5 indicated a near normal Km toward carnitine (10.6 ± 3.9 μm, not significantly different from OCTN2) with a markedly reduced Vmax (18.1 ± 2 nmol/ml cell water/h, p < 0.01 versus OCTN2). The near normal Km of CHIM-5 indicates that the majority of residues needed for carnitine recognition are contained in the first 453 amino acids of OCTN2. This further supported the results obtained with CHIM-1, CHIM-2, CHIM-3, and CHIM-4 indicating that that the substitution of the first 453 amino acids of OCTN2 with the corresponding portion of OCTN1 caused a progressive reduction in the affinity for carnitine. The sudden increase in Km between CHIM-3 and CHIM-4 indicated that a major domain required for carnitine recognition was contained within residues 341 and 453 of OCTN2. Sodium Stimulation of Carnitine Transport in CHO Cells Expressing Normal and Chimeric OCTN2 Transporters—The binding of a co-substrate can affect the affinity of a transporter toward the substrate (19Segel I.H. Enzyme Kinetics. John Wiley & Son, New York1975: 274-345Google Scholar). We have previously seen that a marked decrease in extracellular sodium concentration increases the Km of OCTN2 toward carnitine (10Wang Y. Meadows T.A. Longo N. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 20782-20786Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). Kinetic analysis of carnitine transport at different extracellular sodium concentrations indicated that sodium has at least two functions in carnitine transport (10Wang Y. Meadows T.A. Longo N. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 20782-20786Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). At low concentrations, sodium lowers the Km of OCTN2 toward carnitine (10Wang Y. Meadows T.A. Longo N. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 20782-20786Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar), suggesting binding to a site close to the carnitine binding site. Higher sodium concentrations provide the electrochemical gradient to transfer the carnitine-sodium complex inside the cell (10Wang Y. Meadows T.A. Longo N. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 20782-20786Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). To exclude that the changes in the Km toward carnitine measured in CHIM-1, CHIM-2, CHIM-3, and CHIM-4 were caused by abnormal interaction with the co-transported sodium, the kinetics of sodium-stimulated carnitine transport were obtained (Fig. 4). Half-maximal stimulation of carnitine transport was obtained at a sodium concentration of 13 ± 2.7 mm in CHO cells expressing the normal OCTN2 cDNA, a value similar to that reported previously in CHO cells (11.6 mm, Ref. 10Wang Y. Meadows T.A. Longo N. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 20782-20786Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar) and in human fibroblasts that express the same transporter (11.4 ± 2.1 mm, Ref. 18Scaglia F. Wang Y. Longo N. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1999; 364: 99-106Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). KNa (the concentration of sodium at which half-maximal stimulation of carnitine transport was observed) increased to 51.7 ± 8.6 mm with CHIM-1 (p < 0.01 versus OCTN2 using 99% confidence intervals) and remained elevated in CHIM-2 (41.9 ± 3.8 mm, p < 0.01 versus OCTN2) and CHIM-3 (38.1 ± 7.9 mm, p < 0.05 versus OCTN2). KNa further increased to 90 ± 26 mm in CHIM-4 (p < 0.05 versus OCTN2). These results indicate that substitution of the N terminus of OCTN2 with OCTN1 in CHIM-1 (amino acids 1–193) leads to an increase in KNa. Therefore the mild increase in Km toward carnitine seen in CHIM-1 could be secondary to changes in the affinity toward the co-transported sodium rather than reflect primary changes of the carnitine binding site. Additional substitution of the N terminus of OCTN2 with OCTN1 in CHIM-2 and CHIM-3 did not appear to further impair the interaction with sodium, as KNa did not further increase. However, the progressive substitution of OCTN2 with OCTN1 in CHIM-2 and CHIM-3 did result in a significant progressive increase in the Km toward carnitine (Fig. 3), indicating the presence of domains interacting directly with the substrate between amino acids 194 and 340. Further substitution of OCTN2 with OCTN1 in CHIM-4 results in markedly decreased carnitine transport for both an increase in KNa (90 ± 26 mm) and a dramatic increase in the Km toward carnitine (141 ± 19 μm). Therefore, although multiple domains of the transporter contribute to carnitine recognition, the domain comprised between amino acids 341 and 453 of OCTN2 is the one with the most severe effect on carnitine (and possibly sodium) recognition. CHIM-5 had a near normal Km toward carnitine (Fig. 3). However, the Vmax for carnitine transport was markedly reduced (Fig. 3). This behavior was similar to that previously described for the E452K mutant carnitine transporter, which had a normal Km toward carnitine but markedly increased KNa (10Wang Y. Meadows T.A. Longo N. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 20782-20786Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar, 20Wang Y. Kelly M.A. Cowan T.M. Longo N. Hum. Mutat. 2000; 15: 238-245Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). The E452K mutation did not affect the Km of the transporter toward carnitine and remained normally sensitive to the effects of low concentrations of sodium on the Km toward carnitine, indicating that it is not located close to a carnitine binding site (10Wang Y. Meadows T.A. Longo N. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 20782"

By comparing 500 active-site large subunit sequences from flowering plants with that of the green alga Chlamydomonas reinhardtii, a small number of residues were found to differ in regions previously shown by mutant screening to influence CO2/O2 specificity. When directed mutagenesis and chloroplast transformation were used to change Chlamydomonas Met-42 and Cys-53 to land plant Val-42 and Ala-53 in the large subunit N-terminal domain, little or no change in Rubisco catalytic properties was observed. However, changing Chlamydomonas methyl-Cys-256, Lys-258, and Ile-265 to land plant Phe-256, Arg-258, and Val-265 at the bottom of the α/β-barrel active site caused a 10% decrease in CO2/O2 specificity, largely due to an 85% decrease in carboxylation catalytic efficiency (Vmax/Km). Because land plant Rubisco enzymes have greater CO2/O2 specificity than the Chlamydomonas enzyme, this group of residues must be complemented by other residues that differ between Chlamydomonas and land plants. The Rubisco x-ray crystal structures indicate that these residues may reside in a variable loop of the nuclear-encoded small subunit, more than 20 Å away from the active site.

Biophys. 2003; 414: 130-140Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar), it may be possible to exploit the vast sequence data base to gain a deeper understanding of the structure-function relationships of this enzyme. In particular, the values of catalytic efficiency and CO2/O2 specificity vary among Rubisco enzymes from divergent species (3.Jordan D.B. Ogren W.L.

Commun. 1997; 233: 568-571Crossref PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar), but residues directly involved in catalysis at the α/β-barrel active site are nearly 100% conserved. Thus, divergent residues, relatively far from the active site, must account for the differences in kinetic constants. The potential functional significance of these residues may be deduced by comparing the numerous Rubisco x-ray crystal structures that reside in the Protein Data Bank (6.Berman H.M. Westbrook J.

Rubisco is a bifunctional enzyme that catalyzes either the carboxylation or oxygenation of RuBP, thereby initiating the Calvin cycle of photosynthesis or the photorespiratory pathway that leads to the loss of fixed carbon. The competition of CO2 and O2 at the rate-determining partial reaction (14.Pierce J. Andrews T.J. Lorimer G.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 10248-10256Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) is defined by the CO2/O2 specificity factor (Ω = VcKo/VoKc, where Vc and Vo are the Vmax values for carboxylation and oxygenation, and Kc and Ko are the Km values for CO2 and O2, respectively) (15.Laing W.A. Ogren W.L. Hageman R.H. Plant Physiol. 1974; 54: 678-685Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 16.Chen Z. Spreitzer R.J. Photosynth. Res. 1992; 31: 157-164Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). However, net carboxylation is defined by the difference between the velocities of carboxylation and oxygenation (15.Laing W.A. Ogren W.L. Hageman R.H. Plant Physiol. 1974; 54: 678-685Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). If one understood the structural basis for differences in the catalytic properties of different Rubisco enzymes, it might be possible to design an improved enzyme as a means for increasing the agricultural production of food, fiber, and renewable energy (reviewed in Refs. 1.Spreitzer R.J. Salvucci M.E. Annu. Rev. Plant Biol. 2002; 53: 449-475Crossref PubMed Scopus (693) Google Scholar and 17.Spreitzer R.J. Photosynth. Res. 1999; 60: 29-42Crossref Scopus (95) Google Scholar). As in land plants, the Rubisco holoenzyme of the green alga Chlamydomonas reinhardtii is composed of eight ∼55-kDa large subunits (coded by the chloroplast rbcL gene) and eight ∼16-kDa small subunits (coded by a family of two nearly identical rbcS genes in the nucleus) (reviewed in Refs. 1.Spreitzer R.J. Salvucci M.E. Annu. Rev. Plant Biol. 2002; 53: 449-475Crossref PubMed Scopus (693) Google Scholar and 18.Spreitzer R.J. Rochaix J.D. Goldschmidt-Clermont M. Merchant S. The Molecular Biology of Chloroplasts and Mitochondria in Chlamydomonas. Kluwer Academic Publishers, Dordrecht, Netherlands1998: 515-527Google Scholar). However, in contrast to land plants, Chlamydomonas can survive in the absence of photosynthesis when provided with acetate as an alternative carbon source, and its rbcL and rbcS genes can both be eliminated or replaced with mutant gene copies via genetic transformation of the chloroplast and nucleus, respectively (18.Spreitzer R.J. Rochaix J.D. Goldschmidt-Clermont M. Merchant S. The Molecular Biology of Chloroplasts and Mitochondria in Chlamydomonas. Kluwer Academic Publishers, Dordrecht, Netherlands1998: 515-527Google Scholar, 19.Spreitzer R.J. Esquivel M.G. Du Y.C. McLaughlin P.D. Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 5615-5621Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). Despite the fact that Chlamydomonas and land plant large subunits are ∼90% identical in amino acid sequence, Chlamydomonas Rubisco has an Ω value (Ω = 60) at least 20% lower than the Ω values of land plant enzymes (Ω = 80–100) (3.Jordan D.B. Ogren W.L. Nature. 1981; 291: 513-515Crossref Scopus (372) Google Scholar, 17.Spreitzer R.J. Photosynth. Res. 1999; 60: 29-42Crossref Scopus (95) Google Scholar). When compared with a representative collection of ∼500 flowering-plant large subunit sequences, there are only 34 residues in the Chlamydomonas large subunit (of a total of 475 residues) that differ from those characteristic of land plants (see supplemental table). Residues identical to those of Chlamydomonas at each of the 34 positions are found in less than 5% of the flowering plant sequences. Various groups of these residues are most likely responsible for the differences in kinetic properties between Chlamydomonas and land plant Rubisco enzymes (3.Jordan D.B. Ogren W.L. Nature. 1981; 291: 513-515Crossref Scopus (372) Google Scholar, 17.Spreitzer R.J. Photosynth. Res. 1999; 60: 29-42Crossref Scopus (95) Google Scholar). However, to change each of the residues to the predominant land plant residue, one at a time and in all possible combinations, would require the creation of ∼234 mutant enzymes. One way to further narrow the search for the structural determinants of differences in catalytic constants is to limit analysis to those regions of the large subunit that are already known to influence the rate-limiting step of catalysis. Mutant screening and selection in Chlamydomonas have previously identified four large subunit regions in which amino acid substitutions cause changes in Ω (reviewed in Ref. 18.Spreitzer R.J. Rochaix J.D. Goldschmidt-Clermont M. Merchant S. The Molecular Biology of Chloroplasts and Mitochondria in Chlamydomonas. Kluwer Academic Publishers, Dordrecht, Netherlands1998: 515-527Google Scholar). In the present study, the two large subunit regions farthest from the active site have been investigated by directed mutagenesis and chloroplast transformation. One of these regions was previously defined by pseudoreversion of a photosynthesis-deficient G54D null mutant (Fig. 1A). A G54V substitution in the large subunit N-terminal domain causes a 17% decrease in Ω (20.Spreitzer R.J. Thow G. Zhu G. Plant Physiol. 1995; 109: 681-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). The other was defined by intragenic suppression in which either an A222T or V262L substitution in the large subunit (21.Hong S. Spreitzer R.J. J. Biol.

Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 14206-14211Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar) complements the low Ω and thermal instability of an L290F mutant enzyme (Fig. 1B) (24.Chen Z. Chastain C.J. Al-Abed S.R.

Plant Physiol. 1993; 101: 1189-1194Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). At the restrictive temperature of 35 °C, the L290F mutant strain completely lacks photosynthesis due to the loss of Rubisco holoenzyme (24.Chen Z. Chastain C.J. Al-Abed S.R. Chollet R. Spreitzer R.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1988; 85: 4696-4699Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). Large subunit residues 222, 262, and 290 reside in the C-terminal domain at the bottom of the α/β-barrel, whereas small subunit residues 54 and 57 reside in the loop between β-strands A and B that shields large subunit residues from solvent (Fig. 1B). All of these residues are between 16 and 30 Å away from the transition-state analog CABP bound in the active site (13.Taylor T.C. Backlund A. Bjorhall K. Spreitzer R.J. Andersson I. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 48159-48164Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). Changing two Chlamydomonas residues to those characteristic of land plants in the large subunit N-terminal domain had little effect on catalysis, but changing three at the bottom of the α/β-barrel domain caused a dramatic decrease in Ω. These latter residues must be complemented by other residues in land plant Rubisco that differ from those characteristic of Chlamydomonas Rubisco. Examination of the Chlamydomonas Rubisco x-ray crystal structure (13.Taylor T.C. Backlund A. Bjorhall K. Spreitzer R.J. Andersson I. J. Biol.

Photosynthesis-deficient, acetate-requiring mutants 18-7G mt+ and 25B1 mt+ were used as hosts for chloroplast transformation. Mutant 18-7G results from an rbcL UAG nonsense mutation that terminates large subunit translation after residue Thr-65 (27.Spreitzer R.J. Goldschmidt-Clermont M. Rahire M. Rochaix J.D. Proc. Natl.

Nickoloff J.A. Anal. Biochem. 1992; 200: 81-88Crossref PubMed Scopus (1079) Google Scholar). Mutations were created to produce the single amino acid substitutions M42V (ATG → GTA), C53A (TGT → GCT), C256F (TGT → TTC), K258R (AAA → CGT), and I265V (ATT → GTA). Directed mutant plasmids were then used to create double mutant (M42V/C53A, C256F/K258R, C256F/I265V, K258R/I265V) and triple mutant (C256F/K258R/I265V) substitutions by making the same rbcL base changes as for the single mutant substitutions. The mutant plasmids were transformed into the chloroplast of mutant 18-7G mt+ (for changes at residues 42 and 53) or 25B1 mt+ (for changes at residues 256, 258, and 265) by using a helium-driven biolistic device (30.Finer J.J.

The rbcL gene from each mutant strain was then PCR amplified and completely sequenced to confirm that only the expected mutations were present. Biochemical Analysis—Dark-grown cells were sonicated at 0 °C for 3 min in 50 mm Bicine (pH 8.0), 10 mm NaHCO3, 10 mm MgCl2, and 1 mm dithiothreitol. Cell debris was removed by centrifugation at 30,000 × g for 15 min, and the amount of protein in the supernatant (cell extract) was quantified (34.Bradford M.M. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 72: 248-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (217547) Google Scholar). Samples were prepared (35.Thow G. Zhu G. Spreitzer R.J. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 5109-5114Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar) and subjected to SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis with a 7.5–15% polyacrylamide gradient in the running gel (36.Chua N.H. Methods Enzymol. 1980; 69: 434-446Crossref Scopus (331) Google Scholar). Proteins were transferred from the gel to nitrocellulose, probed with rabbit anti-tobacco Rubisco immunoglobulin G (0.5 μg/ml), and detected via enhanced chemiluminescence (Amersham Biosciences) (35.Thow G. Zhu G. Spreitzer R.J. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 5109-5114Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). Rubisco holoenzyme was purified from cell extract by sucrose gradient centrifugation in 50 mm Bicine (pH 8.0), 10 mm NaHCO3, 10 mm MgCl2, and 1 mm dithiothreitol (33.Spreitzer R.J. Chastain C.J. Curr. Genet. 1987; 11: 611-616Crossref Scopus (40) Google Scholar). RuBP carboxylase and oxygenase activities were measured via the incorporation of acid-stable 14C from NaH14CO3 (24.Chen Z.

The Ω value of purified and activated Rubisco (20 μg/reaction) was determined by assaying carboxylase and oxygenase activities simultaneously in 130 μm [1-3H]RuBP (9.7 Ci/mol) and 2 mm NaH14CO3 (5.0 Ci/mol) in 30-min reactions at 25 °C (37.Jordan D.B.

Rubisco thermal stability was assayed by incubating purified enzymes (5 μg) in 0.5 ml of 50 mm Bicine (pH 8.0), 10 mm NaH14CO3 (2 Ci/mol), and 10 mm MgCl2 at various temperatures for 10 min (22.Du Y.C.

The samples were cooled on ice for 5 min, and carboxylase activity was initiated at 25 °C by adding 20 μl of 10 mm RuBP.

Mutagenesis, Transformation, and Recovery of Mutants—Based on the x-ray crystal structure of Chlamydomonas Rubisco (13.Taylor T.C. Backlund A. Bjorhall K. Spreitzer R.J. Andersson I. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 48159-48164Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar), there are only two large subunit residues that are substantially different from those characteristic of land plants in the area surrounding Gly-54. Whereas Met-42 and Cys-53 are in van der Waals contact in the Chlamydomonas enzyme (Fig. 1A), land plants most often have Val-42 and Ala-53 (see supplemental table). In the area around Leu-290, there are three closely associated large subunit residues that differ from those of land plants (Fig. 1B). The Chlamydomonas large subunit contains methyl-Cys-256, Lys-258, and Ile-265, whereas land plants contain Phe-256, Arg-258, and Val-265 (see supplemental table). Methylation of Cys-256 is apparent in the Chlamydomonas crystal structure (13.Taylor T.C. Backlund A. Bjorhall K. Spreitzer R.J. Andersson I. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 48159-48164Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar), but this posttranslational modification has not yet been observed in the crystal structures of Rubisco from any other species (7.Andersson I.

Mutations were created to change the Chlamydomonas large subunit residues (singularly and in groups) to those characteristic of land plants. When the mutant rbcL genes were transformed into the Rubisco-deficient host strains, photosynthesiscompetent transformants were recovered on minimal medium in the light at frequencies comparable with that observed with wild-type rbcL (22.Du Y.C. Spreitzer R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 19844-19847Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar, 32.Zhu G. Spreitzer R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 18494-18498Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). Except for the K258R/I265V double and C256F/K258R/I265V triple mutants, which grew moderately slower than wild type on minimal medium in the light at 25 °C, all of the mutant strains had a wild-type phenotype when growth was compared in spot tests (26.Spreitzer R.J. Mets L. Plant Physiol. 1981; 67: 565-569Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) on minimal and acetate medium (in light or darkness). When equal amounts of total soluble proteins were subjected to Western blotting, the N-terminal domain single (M42V and C53A) and double (M42V/C53A) mutants had levels of Rubisco holoenzyme similar to that of wild type (data not shown). With respect to the bottom of the α/β-barrel, only the K258R/I265V double and C256F/K258R/I265V triple mutants had somewhat less Rubisco holoenzyme than wild type (Fig. 2). Because the L290F substitution causes a decrease in holoenzyme thermal stability, and its suppressor substitutions (large subunit A222T or V262L, or small subunit N54S or A57V) improve Rubisco thermal stability (21.Hong S. Spreitzer R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 11114-11117Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar, 22.Du Y.C. Spreitzer R.J. J. Biol.

A. 2000; 97: 14206-14211Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar), it seemed possible that the K258R/I265V double and C256F/K258R/I265V triple substitutions in this region might also affect holoenzyme thermal stability. However, the triple mutant substitutions (Fig. 3), or any of the other substitutions (data not shown), had no effect on the thermal stability of purified holoenzyme analyzed in vitro. The structures of the K258R/I265V double and C256F/K258R/I265V triple mutant enzymes may be altered in ways that make them somewhat more susceptible to proteolysis in vivo, thereby causing a small decrease in the amount of holoenzyme (Fig. 2). Nonetheless, substantial amounts of stable Rubisco could be purified from all the mutant strains.Fig. 3Thermal inactivation of purified Rubisco from wild type (○) and the triple large subunit mutant C256F/K258R/I265V (•). Rubisco was incubated at each temperature for 10 min, cooled on ice, and assayed for RuBP carboxylase activity at 25 °C. Activities were normalized to the specific activities measured after the 35 °C incubation (wild type, 1.1 μmol/min/mg; mutant C256F/K258R/I265V, 0.2 μmol/min/mg).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Catalytic Efficiency of the N-terminal Domain Mutant Enzymes—The N-terminal domain single (M42V and C53A) and double (M42V/C53A) mutant enzymes were first analyzed with respect to carboxylase activity at limiting CO2 (0.98 mm NaHCO3 in the absence of O2) and the inhibition of this activity by O2. The ratio (R) of these two activities is defined by Kc and Ko according to the relationship R = 1 + Kc[O2]/Ko(Kc + [CO2]) (24.Chen Z. Chastain C.J. Al-Abed S.R. Chollet R. Spreitzer R.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1988; 85: 4696-4699Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). As shown in Table I, all of the mutant enzymes had a normal ratio of carboxylase activities, indicating that the Ko/Kc values are also normal. Only the M42V enzyme had a modest decrease in carboxylase-specific activity when assayed with saturating CO2 (12.4 mm NaHCO3 in the absence of O2), which appeared to be compensated for by the C53A substitution in the M42V/C53A double mutant enzyme (Table I). The M42V/C53A double mutant enzyme must also have a slightly greater level of oxygenase activity to account for its small but significant decrease in Ω (Table I). However, because these changes are all quite small, it is difficult to propose that the phylogenetic differences in the hydrophobic core of the large subunit N-terminal domain (Fig. 1A) make a major contribution to the differences in catalytic constants between Chlamydomonas and land plant Rubisco.Table IKinetic properties and oxygen inhibition of Rubisco purified from wild type, large subunit single mutants M42V and C53A, and double mutant M42V/C53AEnzymesΩaValues are the means ± S.D.

However, when combined to form the C256F/K258R/I265V triple mutant enzyme, these substitutions caused a 10% decrease in Ω, largely due to an 85% decrease in carboxylation catalytic efficiency (Vc/Kc) (Table II). The double mutant enzymes had greater decreases in Vc/Kc than those of the single mutant enzymes (compare Tables II and III), and the C256F/I265V and K258R/I265V double mutant enzymes had small decreases in Ω (Table III). Thus, as the Chlamydomonas enzyme was changed to be more like that of land plants, both its catalytic efficiency (of the single and double mutant enzymes) and then specificity (of the double and triple mutant enzymes) decreased. Because these effects on catalysis are substantial, although negative, one must conclude that the phylogenetic differences at the bottom of the α/β-barrel domain (Fig. 1B) may play a major role in determining the differences in catalytic constants between Chlamydomonas and land plant Rubisco.Table IIKinetic properties of Rubisco purified from wild type, large subunit single mutants C256F, K258R, and I265V, and triple mutant C256F/K258R/I265VEnzymesΩaValues are the means ± S.D.

Salvucci M.E. Annu. Rev. Plant Biol. 2002; 53: 449-475Crossref PubMed Scopus (693) Google Scholar and 2.Andersson I. Taylor T.C. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 2003; 414: 130-140Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). In particular, Glu-60 at the end of α-helix B interacts with the C-2 carboxyl group of the transition-state analog CABP (10.Andersson I. J. Mol. Biol. 1996; 259: 160-174Crossref PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar, 13.Taylor T.C. Backlund A. Bjorhall K. Spreitzer R.J. Andersson I. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 48159-48164Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). Despite the fact that a G54V substitution in the same α-helix caused a 17% decrease in the Ω value of Chlamydomonas Rubisco (20.Spreitzer R.J. Thow G. Zhu G. Plant Physiol. 1995; 109: 681-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar), changing Met-42 and Cys-53 to the Val-42 and Ala-53 residues characteristic of land plants had only a minor effect on catalysis (Table I). Because the only other residues that differ between Chlamydomonas and land plants in this region are relatively far away and exposed to solvent (Fig. 1A, residues 86 and 105), it is difficult to conclude that the hydrophobic core of the N-terminal domain contributes substantially to the differences in catalytic properties between Chlamydomonas and land plant Rubisco enzymes (3.Jordan D.B. Ogren W.L. Nature. 1981; 291: 513-515Crossref Scopus (372) Google Scholar, 17.Spreitzer R.J. Photosynth. Res. 1999; 60: 29-42Crossref Scopus (95) Google Scholar). In contrast, changing methyl-Cys-256, Lys-258, and Ile-265 to the Phe-256, Arg-258, and Val-265 residues characteristic of land plants at the bottom of the α/β-barrel caused a significant decrease in Ω and catalytic efficiency (Table II). Considering that land plant Rubisco has an Ω value greater than that of Chlamydomonas Rubisco (3.Jordan D.B. Ogren W.L. Nature. 1981; 291: 513-515Crossref Scopus (372) Google Scholar, 17.Spreitzer R.J. Photosynth. Res. 1999; 60: 29-42Crossref Scopus (95) Google Scholar), these land plant residues must be complemented by other residues in the land plant holoenzyme, and these residues must be different from those of Chlamydomonas. There are only three other large subunit residues that differ between Chlamydomonas and land plants in the region surrounding residues 256, 258, and 265 (Fig 1A). Chlamydomonas has Val-221, Val-235, and Ile-282, but land plants have Cys-221, Ile-235, and His-282 (see supplemental table). Although these residues are relatively far from 256, 258, and 265, there may be structural relationships that mediate communication between them (10.Andersson I. J. Mol. Biol. 1996; 259: 160-174Crossref PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar, 13.Taylor T.C. Backlund A. Bjorhall K. Spreitzer R.J. Andersson I. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 48159-48164Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). For example, Leu-219 is in van der Waals contact with both 221 and 256, Leu-240 is in contact with 221 and 265, Tyr-283 is in contact with 258 and 282, and Cys-284 is in contact with 265 and 282. However, the most obvious differences between Chlamydomonas and land plant Rubisco enzymes in the region surrounding residues 256, 258, and 265 derive from interactions with the loop between β-strands A and B of the small subunit (Fig. 1B). Because Chlamydomonas, and green algae in general, has five more residues in the βA–βB loop than do land plants (reviewed in Ref. 40.Spreitzer R.J. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 2003; 414: 141-149Crossref PubMed Scopus (163) Google Scholar), small subunit residues appear to displace large subunit residues characteristic of land plants in this region (Fig. 4). In Chlamydomonas, methyl-Cys-256 and Lys-258 are in van der Waals contact with Val-63 residues from different small subunits. Lys-258 is also in van der Waals contact with small subunit Ser-62 and forms a hydrogen bond with large subunit Asn-287 (Fig. 4A). In spinach, Phe-256 is in van der Waals contact with Arg-258 from a neighboring large subunit, as well as with His-56 in the small subunit βA–βB loop (Fig. 4B). Arg-258 forms an ionic bond with Glu-259 from a neighboring large subunit (Fig. 4B). Chlamydomonas and spinach small subunit residues in structurally similar locations are also in van der Waals contact with large subunit residue 258, but the identities of the interacting small subunit residues are different (Val-63 and Cys-65 in Chlamydomonas, Ser-58 and Pro-59 in spinach) (Fig. 4). It seems likely that changes in residues 256, 258, and 265 would alter the interactions between the large subunit and small subunit βA–βB loop, and such alterations may account for the decrease in catalytic efficiency and specificity of the triple mutant enzyme. One generally considers a neutral theory of evolution to account for the majority of amino acid differences in the sequences of phylogenetically divergent proteins (e.g. Ref. 41.Kimura M. The Neutral Theory of Molecular Evolution. Cambridge University Press, Cambridge1983Crossref Google Scholar). In apparent agreement with this view of evolution, single amino acid substitutions had little effect on Rubisco function (Table I) despite presumed substantial alterations in residue interactions at the small/large subunit interface (Fig. 4). The significance of the unique posttranslational modifications observed in Chlamydomonas Rubisco (13.Taylor T.C. Backlund A. Bjorhall K. Spreitzer R.J. Andersson I. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 48159-48164Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar) are not yet understood, but the substitution of methyl-Cys-256 with Phe also had no substantial effect on Rubisco function (Table I). However, when double (Table III) and triple (Table II) substitutions were created, significant deleterious changes were observed in catalytic efficiency and specificity. When considered as a group, the differences in the identities of these residues between species are, in fact, not neutral. Although a number of possible mechanisms have been proposed by which differences in the small subunit may influence large subunit catalysis (reviewed in Ref. 40.Spreitzer R.J. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 2003; 414: 141-149Crossref PubMed Scopus (163) Google Scholar), one must assume that a cascade of structural alterations ultimately influences the position of active-site residues. Whether such differences can be observed by x-ray crystallography or deduced from the effects of additional mutants or suppressors remains to be determined. Nonetheless, because the C256F/K258R/I265V triple mutant enzyme has significant alterations in kinetics, this engineered region, along with some additional, complementing changes, may convert the catalytic properties of the Chlamydomonas enzyme to those of land plant enzymes. Perhaps substituting a few additional large subunit residues or the entire small subunit βA–βB loop (Fig. 1B), which may be possible in Chlamydomonas (18.Spreitzer R.J. Rochaix J.D. Goldschmidt-Clermont M. Merchant S. The Molecular Biology of Chloroplasts and Mitochondria in Chlamydomonas. Kluwer Academic Publishers, Dordrecht, Netherlands1998: 515-527Google Scholar), will achieve this goal, thereby identifying a region of focus for the design of a better enzyme.

The HIV-1 auxiliary regulatory protein Vpr has been shown to harbor a pro-apoptotic activity that may contribute to cellular and tissue damage during AIDS pathogenesis. The biochemical mechanism of this Vpr function remains unclear. In this report, substitutions of a single amino acid residue Leu64 with Pro, Ala, or Arg are shown to dramatically enhance the pro-apoptotic activity of Vpr, as evidenced by the degradation of cellular DNA into fragments of 200-bp increments. Substitutions of Leu64 with conservative residues have no effect. The pro-apoptotic activity of the VprL64P mutant also requires activation of caspase(s) and is inhibited by the secondary mutation I61A, indicating a high specificity for Vpr-induced apoptosis. Among the three HIV-1 subtypes examined, a subtype B Vpr and an A/G subtype recombinant Vpr have a moderate level of pro-apoptotic activity, whereas a subtype D Vpr has no detectable activity. However, the L64P mutation efficiently enhances the pro-apoptotic potential of the subtype B and subtype D Vpr molecules but not that of the A/G recombinant Vpr.

Immunol. 1995; 154: 5555-5566PubMed Google Scholar). In the brain of AIDS patients, apoptosis of neurons is also prevalent despite the absence of direct neuronal infection by HIV-1 (5Zhang K. Rana F. Silva C. Ethier J. Wehrly K. Chesebro B. Power C. J. Virol. 2003; 77: 6899-6912Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar, 6Kaul M. Garden G.A. Lipton S.A. Nature. 2001; 410: 988-994Crossref PubMed Scopus (1074) Google Scholar). This pattern of apoptosis during clinical HIV-1 infection appears to be because of the ability of HIV-1 to circumvent apoptosis of infected cells, at least at the early phase of the viral life cycle, for the benefit of viral replication. Enhanced apoptosis of “bystander” cells during HIV-1 infection may therefore be a result of interactions between the host cells and soluble viral and immunological factors (4Muro-Cacho C.A. Pantaleo G. Fauci A.S. J. Immunol. 1995; 154: 5555-5566PubMed Google Scholar). Different HIV-1 proteins interact with the cellular regulatory pathways for apoptosis and have a direct impact on the survival of both the infected and uninfected cells. The envelope gp120 has been shown to interact with the chemokine receptor CXCR4 and cause apoptosis of CD4+ or CD8+ T cells, as well as neurons (7Hesselgesser J. Taub D. Baskar P. Greenberg M.

Verdin E. Nature. 1998; 395: 189-194Crossref PubMed Scopus (364) Google Scholar). HIV-1 Nef has been found to have both pro- and anti-apoptotic activities. Nef produced during HIV replication enhances expression of the Fas ligand (FasL) on the surface of infected cells, causing apoptosis of bystander cells through FasL-Fas cross-linking (9Xu X.N. Laffert B. Screaton G.R. Kraft M. Wolf D. Kolanus W. Mongkolsapay J. McMichael A.J. Baur A.S. J. Exp. Med. 1999; 189: 1489-1496Crossref PubMed Scopus (225) Google Scholar). On the other hand, Nef protects the infected cells from apoptosis by inhibition of the apoptosis signal-regulating kinase 1 (ASK1) or inhibition of the pro-apoptotic protein Bad through increased phosphorylation by the p21-activated kinase (10Geleziunas R.

HIV-1 Vpr is a 96-amino acid, 14-kDa auxiliary regulatory protein with pro-apoptotic activities in many cell types (12Stewart S.A. Poon B. Song J.Y. Chen I.S. J.

Vpr-transgenic mice have thymus atrophy, apoptosis of thymocytes, and a dramatic decrease of T cell numbers in lymph nodes and in circulation (15Yasuda J. Miyao T. Kamata M. Aida Y. Iwakura Y. Virology. 2001; 285: 181-192Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). In groups of so-called “long-term nonprogressors,” mutations or truncations of Vpr have been identified that reduce or abolish the pro-apoptotic potential of Vpr (16Somasundaran M. Sharkey M. Brichacek B. Luzuriaga K. Emerman M. Sullivan J.L. Stevenson M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 9503-9508Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar, 18Lum J.J. Cohen O.J. Nie Z. Weaver J.G.

Based on these results, it has been proposed that the pro-apoptotic activity of Vpr may contribute to the pathogenesis of AIDS (16Somasundaran M. Sharkey M. Brichacek B. Luzuriaga K. Emerman M.

In this report, mutational analysis shows that a single L64P, L64A, or L64R mutation dramatically enhances the pro-apoptotic potential of Vpr. The results also suggest that the pro-apoptotic activity of Vpr is dependent on the HIV-1 subtype and is affected significantly by genetic recombination. These results may lead to a better understanding of the contribution of Vpr to AIDS pathogenesis. DNA Constructs—For most of the constructs, the HIV-1 isolate 89.6 (GenBank™ accession number U39362) was used as the template for PCR cloning. The pFSZ3 vector was modified from pFSZ2 (19Zhang S. Feng Y. Narayan O. Zhao L.J. Gene. 2001; 263: 131-140Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). Three DNA fragments were ligated first to generate an intermediate vector pFSZ3(G-): the XhoI/XbaI fragment from pFSZ2 as the vector backbone, the XhoI/PstI digested p89.6/PCR1 DNA (with primers P1/P2), and the PstI/XbaI digested p89.6/PCR2 DNA (with primers P3/P4). Subsequently, PstI-digested GFP-PCR DNA (with primers P5/P6) was inserted into the PstI site of pFSZ3(G-) to generate pFSZ3. The wild type construct pFSZ3-Vpr was generated by substituting the StuI/EcoRI fragment of pFSZ3 with the StuI/EcoRI fragment of pFSZ2-Vpr(wt) (19Zhang S. Feng Y. Narayan O. Zhao L.J. Gene. 2001; 263: 131-140Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). pFSZ3-TAA is modified from pFSZ3-Vpr to carry a premature stop codon in place of the fifth codon in the Vpr ORF. Except as described otherwise, all Vpr mutants were generated by cloning of either a BamHI/EcoRI-digested PCR DNA or a BamHI/SalI-digested PCR DNA into the corresponding sites of pFSZ3. pFSZ3-rD, pFSZ3-rAG, pFSZ3-rD/P, and pFSZ3-rAG/P were prepared by ligation of the BamHI/XhoI-digested PCR DNAs (containing both the start and the stop codons) into the BamHI/SalI site of pFSZ3-Vpr (Fig. 2). This strategy resulted in duplication of the sequence from SalI to the end of the Vpr ORF in the vector. However, this duplication does not affect the amino acid sequence of the synthesized rD or rAG, because a termination codon is contained in the PCR DNA. rD PCR was performed with the template p84ZR085.1 (20Gao F. Robertson D.L. Carruthers C.D. Morrison S.G. Jian B. Chen Y. Barre-Sinoussi F. Girard M. Srinivasan A. Abimiku A.G. Shaw G.M. Sharp P.M. Hahn B.H. J. Virol. 1998; 72: 5680-5698Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) (GenBank™ accession number U88822) and primers P7/P8, and rAG PCR with the template p92NG083.2 (20Gao F. Robertson D.L. Carruthers C.D. Morrison S.G. Jian B. Chen Y. Barre-Sinoussi F. Girard M. Srinivasan A. Abimiku A.G. Shaw G.M. Sharp P.M. Hahn B.H. J. Virol. 1998; 72: 5680-5698Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) (GenBank™ accession number U88826) and primers P9/P10. rD/P and rAG/P mutant PCRs were the same as the parental PCRs except that two overlapping primers, P11/P12, were combined separately with the 5′ and 3′ primers to generate a first round of overlapping PCR fragments that were used together as the template for the final PCR. Primers P8 and P10 both contain a single base change to mutate the overlapping Tat start codon, ATG to ACG, without affecting the amino acid sequence of rD or rAG. Therefore, the Tat start codon in the vector is utilized for the pFSZ3-rD and pFSZ3-rAG constructs. The pFSZ3-L64P/N-AG and pFSZ3-L64P/C-AG chimeric constructs were prepared by swapping the BamHI/EcoRI regions between pFSZ3-L64P and pFSZ3-rAG/P. pFSZ3-I61A/L64P was generated by ligation of a double-stranded oligo (top strand: EcoRI, AATTCCGCAACAACTGCTGTTTATTCATTTCAGAATTGGGTG; bottom strand: SalI, TCGACACCCAATTCTGAAATGAATAAACAGCAGTTGTTGCGG) into the EcoRI/SalI site of pFSZ3-I61A. pFSZ3-L60A/L64P was generated by cloning of the PCR DNA (with primers P9/P13) into the pFSZ3-L64P backbone. All PCR regions were completely sequence-confirmed by automatic sequence analysis (ABI Prism) with primer P14, except for rD and rAG constructs, which were sequenced with P7 and P9, respectively. PCR Primer Pairs for Other Vpr Mutant Constructs Prepared by Ligation of the PCR DNA Fragment into the BamHI/EcoRI or BamHI/SalI Sites of pFSZ3—These primer pairs were as follows: I61A, P9/P15; L64A, P9/P16; L64V, P9/P17; L64M, P9/P18; L64P, P9/P19; L64Q, P9/P20; L64R, P9/P21; R62A/L64P, P9/P22; I63A/L64P, P9/P23.

Cell Culture and DNA Transfection—Human embryonic kidney cell line 293 (ATCC) was maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum and penicillin/streptomycin (Invitrogen). Cells were plated in 12-well plate (2.5 × 105 cells/well) and transfected the next day using LipofectAMINE 2000 (Invitrogen). Typically, 2 μg of DNA was precipitated with 4 μl of LipofectAMINE according to the manufacturer's recommendations. Analysis of Apoptosis Induction by Vpr—At different time points after transfection, cells were harvested. One-third of the cells were used for Western blot and the rest for preparation of total cellular DNA using the Blood Mini Kit (Qiagen). The DNA was eluted in 50 μl of buffer, digested with 10 μg of RNase A for 30 min, and electrophoresed on a 1.5% mini agarose gel (with 4 μl of the DNA). The gel was stained with Vistra Green (Amersham Biosciences) and scanned on a Storm 840 (Amersham Biosciences). Alternatively, small molecular weight DNA was extracted from transfected cells following established conditions (21Ichijo H. Nishida E. Irie K. ten Dijke P. Saitoh M. Moriguchi T. Takagi M. Matsumoto K. Miyazono K. Gotoh Y. Science. 1997; 275: 90-94Crossref PubMed Scopus (2037) Google Scholar), purified using the Blood Mini Kit, and quantified after RNase A treatment and gel electrophoresis. Western blots of cell lysates were performed with a rabbit polyclonal antibody against His6-tagged Vpr following previously described conditions (19Zhang S. Feng Y. Narayan O. Zhao L.J. Gene. 2001; 263: 131-140Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). Based on the recent NMR structural information on Vpr in organic solvent, Vpr has flexible N-terminal and C-terminal domains and three helical domains arranged in a nonplanar U-shape (see Fig. 1B; helical domains are underlined) (22Wecker K. Morellet N. Bouaziz S. Roques B.P. Eur. J. Biochem. 2002; 269: 3779-3788Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). To examine the biological activities of Vpr, the wild type Vpr and its mutants with mutations in the different structural domains were expressed from the pFSZ3 vector (Fig. 1, A and B). This vector was based on the HIV-1 genome with targeted gene deletions and the insertion of the GFP coding sequence in place of the Env gene. All of the Vpr mutant constructs, as well as the wild type Vpr construct, were generated by PCR followed by sequence confirmation of the PCR-amplified region in the constructs. Vpr-expressing plasmids were individually transfected into human embryonic kidney cell line 293. Interestingly, after 18 h of transfection, extensive cell death, as indicated by cell rounding and detachment from the culturing surface, was observed for only the VprL64A mutant of the total of 22 Vpr proteins examined (data not shown). The wild type Vpr, as well as the Vpr-null construct (TAA), did not induce detectable cell death by this analysis. Because degradation of chromatin DNA into fragments of 200-bp increments is the defining feature of apoptosis, total cellular DNA, which includes DNA from apoptotic and healthy cells, was prepared after 40 h of transfection and examined by electrophoresis on a 1.5% agarose gel (Fig. 1C). A strong apoptotic DNA ladder was observed only for the L64A mutant (Fig. 1C , lane 3) but not for the wild type Vpr (lane 2) or the other mutants listed in Fig. 1B (data not shown). Because apoptosis causes DNA fragmentation into various lengths, lane 3 (Fig. 1C) appears to have more total DNA than other lanes. However, quantification of the DNA suggests similar quantities of DNA in all the lanes. Because the pFSZ3 expression vector also expresses GFP and a truncated Vpu, the pFSZ3-VprL64A construct was subsequently modified to remove the GFP coding sequence and eliminate the translational start codon for Vpu. This modified VprL64A expression construct was as efficient as the original one in inducing apoptosis (data not shown). HIV-1 is well known to generate mutations during its life cycle through the function of reverse transcriptase. However, the L64A mutation (codon: GCN) requires simultaneous mutations of the first two bases of the Leu64 codon CTG, rendering the L64A mutation difficult to occur in vivo. Leu64 is one of the most conserved site in HIV-1 Vpr (16Somasundaran M. Sharkey M. Brichacek B. Luzuriaga K. Emerman M. Sullivan J.L. Stevenson M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 9503-9508Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar). Among all of the singlebase mis-sense mutations of the Leu64 codon CTG that are more likely to occur in vivo, L64P, L64Q, and L64V have been reported in GenBank™ (Table I). The rarity of these mutations is consistent with a critical role of Leu64 for Vpr function.Table IPotential Vpr single-base mutations at codon Leu64First baseSecond baseCodonGenBank™ no.CodonGenBank™ no.CTG(Wild type)CTG(Wild type)GTG (V)AF275065CCG (P)AF000320ATG (M)NoneCAG (Q)AF042982TTG (L)NDCGG (R)None Open table in a new tab To analyze the effects of Leu64 mutations due to single-base changes on the apoptotic activity of Vpr, L64V, L64M, L64P, L64Q, and L64R mutants (Table I) were all expressed in the pFSZ3 vector and examined for their abilities to induce apoptosis (Fig. 1C). Two of these mutants, VprL64P (Fig. 1C , lane 6) and VprL64R (lane 8), had efficient pro-apoptotic activity, whereas other mutants, VprL64V, VprL64M, and VprL64Q, had no discernable differences from the wild type Vpr. Thus, single-base mutations of the Leu64 codon can enhance the pro-apoptotic potential of Vpr as efficiently as the L64A mutation. In the Vpr NMR structure, Leu60 and Ile63 are shown to be part of a hydrophobic cluster formed between the end of helix II and the beginning of helix III (22Wecker K. Morellet N. Bouaziz S. Roques B.P. Eur. J. Biochem. 2002; 269: 3779-3788Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). In the helical wheel model of Vpr helix III, Leu60 and Ile61 are on opposite sides of Leu64 (Fig. 1D). To examine the roles of the Leu64-proximal residues for the pro-apoptotic activity of VprL64P, secondary mutations L60A, I61A, R62A, and I63A were engineered into VprL64P. After transfection, small molecular weight DNA, which was formed only in apoptotic cells, was analyzed and quantified (Fig. 1, E and F). Among these secondary mutations, I61A reduced the pro-apoptotic ability of VprL64P by ∼80% (Fig. 1E , lane 5), whereas the other three mutations had no significant effect (lanes 4, 6, and 7). Thus, apoptosis enhancement by the L64P mutation is highly specific. Although the Vpr amino acid sequence is highly conserved, significant differences exist between different HIV-1 subtypes. Whether these subtype-specific sequence variations affect the pro-apoptotic activity of Vpr is unknown. To examine the pro-apoptotic potentials of Vpr molecules from other HIV-1 subtypes, two additional Vpr genes were expressed in pFSZ3 and analyzed. In Fig. 2A, Vpr is the sequence used for the initial studies and is from a subtype B HIV-1 isolate (23Collman R. Balliet J.W. Gregory S.A. Friedman H. Kolson D.L. Nathanson N. Srinivasan A. J. Virol. 1992; 66: 7517-7521Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). rD is Vpr from a subtype D isolate, and rAG is Vpr from an A/G subtype recombinant (20Gao F. Robertson D.L. Carruthers C.D. Morrison S.G. Jian B. Chen Y. Barre-Sinoussi F. Girard M. Srinivasan A. Abimiku A.G. Shaw G.M. Sharp P.M. Hahn B.H. J. Virol. 1998; 72: 5680-5698Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). To compare the efficiency of apoptosis, small molecular weight DNA, which was formed only in apoptotic cells, was prepared and analyzed (Fig. 2C). Both rD and rAG were expressed at similar levels to Vpr (Fig. 2C , lower panel). Interestingly, although rAG (Fig. 2C , lane 5) generated a DNA ladder to the same extent as Vpr, rD had no detectable pro-apoptotic activity (lane 4). Surprisingly, rD with the L64P mutation, rD/P (Fig. 2C , lane 6), efficiently induced apoptosis to the same extent as VprL64P, whereas rAG with the L64P mutation, rAG/P (lane 7), had no difference from the parental rAG. Thus, Vpr molecules from different subtypes of HIV-1 appear to have different pro-apoptotic potentials and different degrees of permissiveness to L64P-enhanced apoptosis. It has been shown that rAG is a hybrid Vpr molecule from an HIV-1 isolate of the A/G subtype recombinant (20Gao F. Robertson D.L. Carruthers C.D. Morrison S.G. Jian B. Chen Y. Barre-Sinoussi F. Girard M. Srinivasan A. Abimiku A.G. Shaw G.M. Sharp P.M. Hahn B.H. J. Virol. 1998; 72: 5680-5698Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Although the exact breaking point for recombination is unclear, the N- and C-terminal regions of rAG are from the A and G subtypes, respectively. The nonconservative amino acid changes in rAG that are different from Vpr and rD reside mostly in helix II and the C-terminal domain (Fig. 2A). To examine the sequence determinants in rAG that render rAG/P ineffective in apoptosis, the region of amino acids 1–63 was swapped between VprL64P and rAG/P (Fig. 2B , right) to obtain L64P/N-AG and L64P/C-AG chimeric proteins, which contain the N- and the C-terminal regions of rAG, respectively. Unexpectedly, when these chimeric proteins were expressed, both induced apoptosis effectively (Fig. 2C , lanes 8 and 9). These results suggest that the N- and C-terminal halves of rAG cooperate with each other to resist the apoptosis-enhancing effect of the L64P mutation. This report describes the identification of Leu64 as one of the key determinants for the potent pro-apoptotic potential of HIV-1 Vpr (Fig. 1). Substitution of Leu64 with nonconservative residues Pro, Ala, and Arg enhances the pro-apoptotic potential of Vpr dramatically. It is possible that other nonconservative changes of Leu64 also promote the pro-apoptotic potential of Vpr. This result is reminiscent of SIVmac239 Nef, which upon acquiring two point mutations promotes efficient viral replication in resting cells (24Du Z. Lang S.M. Sasseville V.G. Lackner A.A. Ilyinskii P.O. Daniel M.D. Jung J.U. Desrosiers R.C. Cell. 1995; 82: 665-674Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (235) Google Scholar). Although mutations occur frequently during HIV-1 infection, Leu64 mutations are rarely observed (Table I). This is consistent with a pivotal role of Leu64 for the function of Vpr. It can be hypothesized that during the course of a natural HIV-1 infection, mutations in Vpr, including Leu64 mutations, can emerge, resulting in Vpr molecules with different pro-apoptotic potentials. L64P-type mutations, however, may be selected against because of their potent pro-apoptotic activities. The results in this study also suggest that Vpr molecules from different HIV-1 subtypes have different pro-apoptotic potentials (Fig. 2). Subtype-specific Vpr activity has not been reported. When examined for apoptosis induction, the Vpr from a subtype B HIV-1 has a moderate activity, whereas the Vpr from a subtype D HIV-1 has no detectible activity (Fig. 2). Interestingly, the L64P mutation enhances the pro-apoptotic potentials of both Vpr molecules (Fig. 2). In geographic areas where different subtypes of HIV-1 exist, genetic recombinations occur frequently (20Gao F. Robertson D.L. Carruthers C.D. Morrison S.G. Jian B. Chen Y. Barre-Sinoussi F. Girard M. Srinivasan A. Abimiku A.G. Shaw G.M. Sharp P.M. Hahn B.H. J. Virol. 1998; 72: 5680-5698Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 25Hahn B.H. Shaw G.M. De Cock K.M. Sharp P.M. Science. 2000; 287: 607-614Crossref PubMed Scopus (893) Google Scholar). These genetic recombinations may generate HIV-1 strains with different pathogenic properties (20Gao F. Robertson D.L. Carruthers C.D. Morrison S.G. Jian B. Chen Y. Barre-Sinoussi F. Girard M. Srinivasan A. Abimiku A.G. Shaw G.M. Sharp P.M. Hahn B.H. J. Virol. 1998; 72: 5680-5698Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 25Hahn B.H. Shaw G.M. De Cock K.M. Sharp P.M. Science. 2000; 287: 607-614Crossref PubMed Scopus (893) Google Scholar). In fact, the ancestor of HIV-1, SIVcpz, appears to be derived from genetic recombinations among SIV isolates that infect various species of monkeys (26Bailes E. Gao F. Bibollet-Ruche F. Courgnaud V. Peeters M. Marx P.A. Hahn B.H. Sharp P.M. Science. 2003; 300: 1713Crossref PubMed Scopus (311) Google Scholar). Interestingly, a hybrid Vpr molecule from the A/G subtype recombinant HIV-1 resists the apoptosis-promoting effect of the L64P mutation, although the original A/G hybrid Vpr has a moderate pro-apoptotic activity (Fig. 2). Thus, the pro-apoptotic activity of Vpr may be affected by subtype-specific sequences, point mutations during HIV-1 replication, or genetic recombination between different HIV-1 isolates. More thorough analysis in this regard may lead to a better understanding of the roles of Vpr during pathogenesis caused by different subtypes of HIV-1. The recently determined NMR structure of Vpr has three helical regions (Fig. 1B). The third helix, where Leu64 resides, is most abundant in Leu/Ile residues and is capable of forming a leucine zipper-like structure (27Wang L. Mukherjee S. Narayan O. Zhao L.J. Gene. 1996; 178: 7-13Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). The structure of Vpr is compact because of tertiary hydrophobic interactions between helix II and helix III and potential long-range interactions between helix I and helix III under physiological conditions (22Wecker K. Morellet N. Bouaziz S. Roques B.P. Eur. J. Biochem. 2002; 269: 3779-3788Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). It has been noted that Leu60 and Ile63 are both part of a hydrophobic cluster formed between helix II and helix III (22Wecker K. Morellet N. Bouaziz S. Roques B.P. Eur. J. Biochem. 2002; 269: 3779-3788Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). However, mutation of either residue does not affect the strong pro-apoptotic activity of VprL64P (Fig. 1E). Although both Leu60 and Ile61 are located in the vicinity of Leu64 in the Vpr helical wheel model (Fig. 1D), only I61A inhibits the strong pro-apoptotic activity of VprL64P. It is possible that the effects of the L60A and I63A mutations are compensated for by the nearby Leu/Ile residues in helix III (Fig. 1D). Alternatively, position “g” residues in the helical wheel model of helix III (Fig. 1D) may be critical for Vpr interaction with the cellular apoptosis regulatory pathways. Apoptosis induction by VprL64P is dependent on caspase(s) (data not shown), similar to previous observations on the wild type Vpr (12Stewart S.A. Poon B. Song J.Y. Chen I.S. J.

Caspase-dependent apoptosis is initiated by the activation of the initiator caspases, including caspases 8 and 9, which in turn activate the effector caspases (29Budihardjo I. Oliver H. Lutter M. Luo X. Wang X. Annu. Rev. Cell Dev. Biol. 1999; 15: 269-290Crossref PubMed Scopus (2274) Google Scholar). Although caspase 8 is essential for the death receptor-mediated apoptosis pathway (30Tibbetts M.D. Zheng L. Lenardo M.J. Nat. Immunol. 2003; 4: 404-409Crossref PubMed Scopus (193) Google Scholar), caspase 9 is activated by the Bcl-2 family-controlled mitochondrial pathway (29Budihardjo I. Oliver H. Lutter M. Luo X. Wang X. Annu. Rev. Cell Dev. Biol. 1999; 15: 269-290Crossref PubMed Scopus (2274) Google Scholar). In certain types of cells, apoptosis induction by activated caspase 8 requires amplification through the mitochondria-caspase 9 pathway (31Scaffidi C. Fulda S. Srinivasan A. Friesen C. Li F. Tomaselli K.J. Debatin K.M. Krammer P.H. Peter M.E. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 1675-1687Crossref PubMed Scopus (2633) Google Scholar). It has been reported that the adenoviral-expressed wild type Vpr activates caspase 9 through cytochrome c release from the mitochondria (17Muthumani K. Hwang D.S. Desai B.M. Zhang D. Dayes N. Green D.R. Weiner D.B. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 37820-37831Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar). Cell-expressed Vpr has also been shown to cause activation of caspase 8 and mitochondrial permeabilization (18Lum J.J. Cohen O.J. Nie Z. Weaver J.G. Gomez T.S. Yao X.J. Lynch D. Pilon A.A. Hawley N.

Thus, it remains unclear which initiator caspase is essential for Vpr induction of apoptosis. Identification of the initial biochemical events responsible for caspase activation by Vpr and VprL64P may help us to better understand the mechanism of Vpr-induced apoptosis. We are grateful to Drs.

Recently even intracellular members of the protein superfamily have been identified (for review see Ref. 1.Whittaker C.A. Hynes R.O. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2002; 13: 3369-3387Crossref PubMed Scopus (527) Google Scholar). It is generally assumed that VWA domains mediate protein-protein interactions and extracellular VWA-domain-containing proteins are involved in cell-cell, cell-matrix, and matrix-matrix interactions and thereby play roles in important physiological processes such as immunity, hemostasis, and wound healing (2.Lee J.O. Rieu P. Arnaout M.A. Liddington R. Cell. 1995; 80: 631-638Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (798) Google Scholar). X-ray crystallography revealed a structure made up from alternating α helices and a central β sheet also known as the Rossman fold. Some VWA domains contain a conserved MIDAS (metal ion-dependent adhesion site) sequence motif, which can be involved in ligand binding. The structures of the A1 domain (3.Emsley J. Cruz M. Handin R.

The matrilins constitute a recently discovered family of extracellular matrix proteins (for review see Ref. 12.Deak F. Wagener R. Kiss I. Paulsson M. Matrix Biol. 1999; 18: 55-64Crossref PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar). Matrilin-1 and -3 are expressed almost exclusively in skeletal tissues, whereas matrilin-2 and -4 have a much broader distribution. In the extracellular matrix of cultured cells matrilins are deposited in fibrillar networks. All matrilins have a similar modular composition with VWA-like and epidermal-growth factor (EGF)-like domains followed by a C-terminal coiled-coil domain. It is thought that matrilins play a role in mediating interactions between major components of the extracellular matrix, such as collagens and proteoglycans (13.Hauser N. Paulsson M. Heinegård D. Mörgelin M. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 32247-32252Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar), and indeed matrilin-1, -3, and -4 are associated with native collagen type VI microfibrils extracted from rat chondrosarcoma tissue (14.Wiberg C. Klatt A.R. Wagener R. Paulsson M. Bateman J.F. Heinegård D. Mörgelin M. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 37698-37704Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (213) Google Scholar). The matrilins are bound to the small leucine-rich repeat proteins biglycan and decorin, which in turn interact with the N-terminal globular domains of the collagen VI molecules. At the periphery of the microfibrillar complex matrilins were found to mediate interactions with aggrecan or collagen II. A subgroup within the large family of collagens contains VWA domains in addition to triple helical structures. Among these, collagens XII, XIV, XX, and XXI are fibril-associated collagens with an interrupted triple helix and are thought to bind to other extracellular matrix components by their N-terminal, VWA-containing segments (1.Whittaker C.A. Hynes R.O. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2002; 13: 3369-3387Crossref PubMed Scopus (527) Google Scholar). The homotrimeric collagen VII forms a cross-like structure where the three globular N-terminal domains, consisting of VWA- and FN3 domains, form the short arms. By these domains a variety of ligands, e.g. collagens I and IV and laminins 5 and 6, are bound (1.Whittaker C.A. Hynes R.O. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2002; 13: 3369-3387Crossref PubMed Scopus (527) Google Scholar). The microfibril-forming, heterotrimeric collagen VI also contains VWA domains in each subunit, and these have been shown to interact with fibrillar collagen I (15.Bonaldo P. Russo V. Bucciotti F. Doliana R. Colombatti A. Biochemistry. 1990; 29: 1245-1254Crossref PubMed Scopus (205) Google Scholar). In the present study we have characterized a new extracellular member of the VWA domain family, AMACO. The AMACO VWA domains share homology with those found in matrilins and collagens. RT-PCR and 5′ RACE—RT-PCR was used to clone the mouse and human AMACO cDNAs. Primers were designed according to EST and genomic sequences (Table I). To prevent mutations in the RT-PCR we used the Expand High Fidelity PCR system (Roche Applied Science). The mouse full-length clone was amplified from cDNA of epiphyseal cartilage of newborn mice using primers AMm1 and AMm2. The human cDNA was cloned from mRNA of 293-EBNA cells in two overlapping fragments using primer pairs AMh2/AMh5 and AMh3/AMh4.Table IOligonucleotide primer sequencesNameSequence 5′→3′Positionaf, forward; r, reverse.Mouse primers AMm1TTGCCAGTGAGCGAGCGAG1-19 (f) AMm2CGCAGTAGTCGTTCCCAACATC2653-2632, (r) AMm6TGAGGACAAGGTGATGACGG2021-2040 (f) AMm15PbPrimer AM15P was 3′-phosphorylated.TGTAGAAGGGACAG1002-989 (r) AMm14CAATGCCTTGTGCTGGAGAG935-954 (f) RACE3TGGATCAGCAGTGGTGCAGAGTGCGGAG869-842 (r) AMm4AGAGGATCAAGGCAAGCAG951-969 (f) AMm13ACTCCTACGGCAAACACGAC724-705 (r)Human primers AMh2AGCCGTCTGTGTTTTCCTG274-293 (f) AMh5TGGTTGAACAGATCCTGAGG1776-1757 (r) AMh3AGATCACAGGCAGCCCAAAG1716-1735 (f) AMh4GGAAGCAGACATTCTAAGGAC2647-2637 (r) AMh10TCCAGCATGGGGCATTGCCAGCGAAC1031-1006 (r) AMh9AGCTCCCTTTCCCGACGCTGTTAGACCC449-422 (r)a f, forward; r, reverse.b Primer AM15P was 3′-phosphorylated. Open table in a new tab 5′ RACE was performed on mRNA prepared from kidney of adult mice with the QuickPrep mRNA purification kit (Amersham Biosciences) according to the TAKARA 5′-Full RACE Core Set protocol using primers AM15P, AM14, AM4, RACE3, and AM13. The control placenta cDNA of the Marathon cDNA amplification kit (Clontech) was used for the cloning of the 5′ end of the human AMACO cDNA using primer pairs AMh10/AP1 (Clontech) and AMh9/AP2 (Clontech) for the nested PCR. Northern Blot Analysis—Total RNA was extracted from various tissues of newborn and adult C57BL/6J mice by the guanidinium-thiocyanate method. 6-μg RNA aliquots were electrophoresed on 1.2% denaturing agarose-formaldehyde gels, blotted, and hybridized with digoxigenin-labeled RNA probes. The conditions for the last two washing steps were: 0.1× SSC, 0.1% SDS at 68 °C for 15 min each. The blots were developed using CDP-Star (Roche Applied Science) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Expression and Purification of Recombinant AMACO—Murine AMACO cDNA was generated by PCR on the full-length cDNA. Suitable primers introduced a 5′ terminal HindIII and a 3′ terminal NotI restriction site. The amplified PCR product containing the intrinsic sequence coding for the signal peptide was inserted into the expression vector pCEP-Pu (16.Kohfeldt E. Maurer P. Vannahme C. Timpl R. FEBS Lett. 1997; 414: 557-561Crossref PubMed Scopus (201) Google Scholar) downstream of the cytomegalovirus promoter. The vector contained a C-terminal strepII tag (17.Smyth N. Odenthal U. Merkl B. Paulsson M. Methods Mol. Biol. 2000; 139: 49-57PubMed Google Scholar) downstream of the NotI site. The recombinant plasmid was introduced into human embryonic kidney 293-EBNA cells (Invitrogen) by electroporation. The cells were selected with puromycin (1 μg/ml) and transferred to serum-free medium for harvesting of the recombinant protein. After filtration and centrifugation (1 h, 10,000 × g), the AMACO-containing cell culture supernatant was concentrated on a DEAE-Sepharose Fast Flow column (2 ml, Amersham Biosciences), and proteins were eluted with 1 m NaCl, 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0. The eluate containing the C-terminally strepII-tagged AMACO was applied to a streptactin column (1.5 ml, IBA GmbH) and eluted with 2.5 mm desthiobiotin, 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0. Preparation of Antibodies to AMACO—The purified, C-terminally strepII-tagged AMACO was used to immunize a rabbit. The antiserum obtained was purified by affinity chromatography on a column with antigen coupled to CNBr-activated Sepharose (Amersham Biosciences). The specific antibodies were eluted with 0.1 m glycine, pH 2.5, and the eluate was neutralized with 1 m Tris-HCl, pH 8.8. SDS-PAGE, Immunoblotting, and Determination of the N-terminal Sequence—SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis was performed as described by Laemmli (18.Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (206620) Google Scholar). For immunoblots the proteins were transferred to nitrocellulose and incubated with the appropriate affinity-purified rabbit antibody diluted in TBS containing 5% low fat milk powder. Bound antibodies were detected by luminescence using peroxidase-conjugated swine anti-rabbit IgG (Dako), 3-aminopthalhydrazide (1.25 mm), p-coumaric acid (225 μm), and 0.01% H2O2. For the determination of the AMACO N terminus, a cut-out gel band was reduced with 20 mm dithiothreitol for 15 min at 37 °C and alkylated with 50 mm iodoacetamide for 15 min at 37 °C in 50 mm ammonium bicarbonate, pH 8.0. The in-gel digestion with trypsin was carried out overnight at an enzyme concentration of 12.5 ng/μl in 50 mm ammonium bicarbonate, pH 8.0, at 37 °C. Subsequent elution was performed in two steps with 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid/acetonitrile (2:3) for a total of 30 h. The supernatants were pooled and dried in a vacuum centrifuge, and the peptides were dissolved in 5% formic acid. ESI Q-TOF mass spectrometry was used to sequence a peptide containing the N-terminal 13 amino acid residues of mature AMACO. In Situ Hybridization—Tissues from newborn mice were fixed overnight with 4% paraformaldehyde in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS), pH 7.4, at 4 °C, washed overnight with PBS at 4 °C, dehydrated, and embedded in paraffin. Sections of 7 μm were cut, mounted on SuperFrost®Plus glass slides, dewaxed in xylene, and rehydrated. After washing in PBS these were digested with 200 milliunits/ml proteinase K, postfixed, and acetylated with 0.25% acetic anhydride. The sections were hybridized overnight at 55 °C with digoxigenin-labeled riboprobes covering the nucleotides 322–1158 of the AMACO cDNA. After hybridization, the sections were washed in 50% formamide, 2× SSC (0.3 m NaCl containing 0.03 m sodium citrate) for 30 min at 55 °C, digested with RNase A, washed once with 2× SSC, and twice with 0.2× SSC for 20 min at 55 °C. The immunological development of the digoxigenin-labeled sections was carried out according to the instructions of the manufacturer (Roche Applied Science) with additional use of polyvinyl alcohol in the detection solution (19.De Block M. Debrouwer D. Anal. Biochem. 1993; 215: 86-89Crossref PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar). Immunohistochemistry—Immunohistochemistry was performed on frozen and paraffin-embedded sections of fetal, newborn, 3-week-old, and adult mice. The frozen sections were prefixed with 0.5% paraformaldehyde in PBS for 10 min. Deparaffinization ensued through incubation for 30 min in Rotihistol (Carl Roth GmbH). After rehydration, the sections were digested with hyaluronidase (Sigma, paraffin sections 500 units/ml, cryostat section 50 units/ml in 0.1 m NaH2PO4, 0.1 m sodium acetate, pH 5.0) at 37 °C for 30 min. The sections were blocked for 1 h with 1% (w/v) bovine serum albumin in TBS and incubated with the affinity-purified AMACO antibody overnight at 4 °C. The primary antibody was visualized by consecutive treatment of the sections with biotin-SP-conjugated goat anti-rabbit IgG (Dianova) and alkaline-phosphatase-conjugated streptavidin (Dianova). All antibodies and the alkaline-phosphatase-conjugated streptavidin were diluted in 1% (w/v) bovine serum albumin in TBS and the slides developed with Sigma FAST™ Fast Red TR/naphthol AS-MX (Sigma). Double immunofluorescence labeling and microscopy was performed as described previously (20.Klatt A.R. Nitsche D.P. Kobbe B. Mörgelin M. Paulsson M. Wagener R. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 3999-4006Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar) using the affinity-purified rabbit antibody against AMACO, a rat monoclonal nidogen-1 antibody (JF3) directed against the G1 domain (21.Ries A. Göhring W. Fox J.W. Timpl R. Sasaki T. Eur. J. Biochem. 2001; 268: 5119-5128Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar), a Cy™3-conjugated affinity-pure donkey anti-rabbit IgG (Jackson ImmunoResearch Laboratories) and a AlexaFluor 488-conjugated goat anti-rat IgG (Molecular Probes). Immunofluorescence Microscopy of Cell Cultures—Cells were plated onto glass or Permanox chamber slides, and after reaching confluence fixed in 4% formaldehyde in PBS. Nonspecific antibody binding was blocked by incubation with 1% (w/v) bovine serum albumin in TBS. Immunolabeling was done by incubation with affinity-purified antibodies to AMACO for 1 h, followed by Cy™3-conjugated affinity-pure donkey anti-rabbit IgG (Jackson ImmunoResearch Laboratories). For cellular co-staining, a mouse monoclonal vinculin antibody (Sigma) was used followed by Cy™2-conjugated affinity-pure goat anti-mouse IgG (Jackson ImmunoResearch Laboratories). Electron Microscopy—Negative staining was performed as described previously (22.Piecha D. Muratoglu S. Mörgelin M. Hauser N. Studer D. Kiss I. Paulsson M. Deak F. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 13353-13361Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar, 23.Engel J. Furthmayr H. Methods Enzymol. 1987; 145: 3-78Crossref PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar), using non-reduced samples of the C-terminally strepII-tagged AMACO (5–10 μg/ml) stained with 0.75% uranyl formate. Cloning of Human and Mouse AMACO cDNAs—In a screen of the genomic database with matrilin sequences as query, a gene was identified in both the human and mouse genome that codes for a protein containing von Willebrand factor A (VWA)-like domains with homology to those present in matrilins and collagens. We named its gene product AMACO (containing A domains related to those in matrilins and collagens). The corresponding cDNAs were cloned by RT-PCR and sequenced (Fig. 1A,Fig. 1A). The mouse AMACO cDNA of 2653 bp contains an open reading frame of 2372 bp, encoding a protein consisting of 791 amino acids residues, preceded by a signal peptide of 23 residues as predicted by a method using neural networks (24.Nielsen H. Engelbrecht J. Brunak S. von Heijne G. Protein Eng. 1997; 10: 1-6Crossref PubMed Scopus (4923) Google Scholar). The mature secreted protein has a calculated Mr of 83,024 and a modular structure characteristic for extracellular matrix proteins (Fig. 1B,Fig. 1B). An N-terminal VWA-like domain is followed by a cysteine-rich region that has no obvious similarity to any other known domain. Toward the C terminus, an EGF-like domain, two additional VWA-like domains, and a second EGF-like domain follow. A search of the module database SMART (smart.embl-heidelberg.de/) indicated that both EGF-like domains are of the non-calcium-binding variety. The very C-terminal end is made up by a unique stretch of amino acid residues. A splice variant lacking the sequence coding for the third VWA domain was detected in mRNA prepared from a day 11.5 mouse whole embryo. The human cDNA of 2647 bp has an overall identity of 72.8% to the mouse ortholog and has an open reading frame of 2265 bp (Fig. 1A,Fig. 1A). The human protein also has a predicted signal peptide of 23 amino acid residues and the mature secreted protein an Mr of 79,485. The domain structure is identical to that of the mouse AMACO, except for that the C-terminal, unique sequence is lacking. The overall identity at the amino acid level is 80.5%. Surprisingly, the codon for Y 137, present in human, is missing in mouse AMACO.Fig. 1Nucleotide and deduced amino acid sequences of mouse and human AMACO and domain structure of mouse AMACO (next page). The upper lines represent the mouse sequences. Except for part of the 5′-UTR, the differences in the human sequences are indicated below. Arrows mark the signal peptide cleavage sites.

Nevertheless, a search of the module databases SMART (smart.embl-heidelberg.de/) and PFAM (www.sanger.ac.uk/software/pfam/) returned scores for a VWA domain of 6.90e-35 and 5.70e-37 for the A1 domain, 1.26e-28 and 8.20e-21 for the A2 domain, and 1.55e-37 and 1.40e-31 for the A3 domain. Sequence alignment of the mouse AMACO VWA domains with their counterparts in matrilins and selected collagens shows the homology (Fig. 2). The sequence identity between the mouse AMACO VWA domains ranges between 21.6% for A2- and A3 domains and 26.5% for the A1- and A2 domains. Higher identity values were obtained for the A2 domain of mouse matrilin-4 and the mouse AMACO A1 domain (35.8%) and the A4 domain of chicken collagen XII α1 and the mouse AMACO A3 domain (31.4%). However, it was not possible to determine the relationship between the AMACO VWA domains and those of matrilins and collagens with statistical significance by phylogenetic analyses (not shown), which is consistent with an early divergence. Recombinant Expression of Mouse AMACO—cDNA encoding the sequence of mouse AMACO was cloned into the pCEP-Pu vector utilizing the intrinsic AMACO secretion signal sequence and a C-terminal strepII tag (17.Smyth N. Odenthal U. Merkl B. Paulsson M. Methods Mol. Biol. 2000; 139: 49-57PubMed Google Scholar). The recombinant plasmid was introduced into human embryonic kidney 293-EBNA cells and maintained in an episomal form. The recombinant AMACO protein was secreted into the cell culture medium and was subsequently purified by affinity chromatography on a Streptactin column (Fig. 3A). The purified protein appeared in non-reducing SDS-PAGE as a broad band with an apparent molecular mass in the range expected for monomeric AMACO. Bands corresponding to defined higher oligomeric forms of AMACO were not detected, but additional protein was present as very large protein aggregates that hardly entered the gel. Such aggregates were also seen in the original cell culture supernatant (Fig. 3A), showing that they are not formed during the purification. The correct usage of the predicted signal peptide cleavage site was confirmed by ESI Q-TOF mass spectrometry sequencing after tryptic digestion of the purified recombinant strepII-tagged AMACO. Appearance of AMACO in Electron Microscopy—The purified strepII-tagged full-length AMACO was submitted to electron microscopy after negative staining with uranyl formate (Fig. 4). The protein particles were heterogeneous in size, and a closer examination revealed that both monomers and higher aggregates were present in the sample, in agreement with the results from SDS-PAGE analysis. Most of the monomers form compact folded structures, but extended monomeric molecules could occasionally be seen (Fig. 4). In both forms, globular domains were resolved, arranged in a tandem array. Each globule had a diameter of 3–4 nm, which is consistent with that expected for a single VWA domain. Structure of the AMACO Genes—The human and mouse AMACO genes map to syntenic regions on chromosomes 10 (10q26.11) and 19 (19D2), respectively, and, in both cases, lie between the genes coding for the tudor domain containing protein 1 and a hypothetical protein containing a pleckstrin homology domain. Both the AMACO genomic sequences (human: AC005383, NT_030059; mouse: AC125150, NT_039692) are contained in the public databases. We identified exons by flanking consensus splice signals and by comparison with the respective cDNAs. The exon/intron organization of both genes is very similar (Table II). The human gene is 51 kb, the mouse gene 37 kb long, and both AMACO genes consist of 13 exons that code for the translated part of the mRNA. In addition, in mouse and human an exon 0 exists that codes for the 5′-untranslated region. Exon 1 codes for the major part of the signal peptide, whereas the signal peptide cleavage site is encoded on exon 2. The first VWA domain is encoded by exons 3–6, the cysteine-rich domain by exons 7 and 8, and the EGF1, VWA2, VWA3, and EGF2 domains by the single exons 9, 10, 11, and 12, respectively. In mouse, exon 13 codes for the unique C-terminal domain and the 3′-UTR. In contrast, in the human gene a 5-bp deletion of GAGAG, at the beginning of exon 13, leads to a frameshift followed by a stop codon. This leads to the lack of the unique C-terminal sequence in humans, and the last exon of the human gene encodes mainly the 3′-UTR.Table IISplice junction sites in the human and murine AMACO genesExonaH, human; M, mouse; CR, cysteine-rich.DomainSizeSplice donorIntronSizeSplice acceptorCodon phaseAmino acid interruptedbpbp0H5′-UTR240TTCCGgtgagt09,135gtccctgtagTTA0M5′-UTR163ACCAGgtaagg06,547gcccgtatagGTC1HSigPep62CAGAGgtaaga14,885tctctcctagTGCIVal (18)1MSigPep62CAGAGgtaagg13,836tctctcctagTGTIVal (18)2H75CAAAAgtaagc21,189ctctccctagTGAIMet (43)2M75CAAATgtaagt21,782ctgtctccagTAAILeu (43)3HVWA1 A134AGAGGgtgagt35,137cctactgcagGTC0Arg/Val (87/88)3MVWA1 A134GCAGGgtgagt36,755cctcccacagGTC0Arg/Val (87/88)4HVWA1 B110TTCAAgtatgt411,444gtgtgcacagAGGIILys (124)4MVWA1 B110TTCAAgtaagt43,998ctgtcctcagAGGIILys (124)5HVWA1 C195CCCAGgtaaga54,979cttggcacagGTGIIArg (189)5MVWA1 C192CCCAGgtaagt53,463ccccccacagGTGIIArg (188)6HVWA1 D134GCCAGgtaaga6671gtggacacagACTIAsp (234)6MVWA1 D134TCCAGgtagga6574tctgacacagACTIAsp (233)7HCR A133TACAGgtttgt73,664tggattgtagCTGIISer (278)7MCR A133TACAGgttggt71,098tgaattgtagCTGIISer (277)8HCR B56CCCAGgtatgg82,291tctctgatagGCCIGly (297)8MCR B56TCCAGgtatgg81,956tctctggtagGCCIGly (296)9HEGF1108CTGTGgtaggt9968atccccgcagCCCIAla (333)9MEGF1108CTGTGgtatgt9804attccaacagCCCIAla (332)10HVWA2573GCCAGgtaagg102,426gctcctgcagGGTIGly (524)10MVWA2573GCCAGgtaaaa101,869gctcctccagGCTIGly (523)11HVWA3552TGGAGgtgagt11750tccattgtagAAGIGlu (708)11MVWA3552TAGAGgtgagt11306tcctttgtagAAGIGlu (707)12HEGF2126GAACCgtgagt12852ccttccccagGATIArg (750)12MEGF2126GAACCgtgagt12799tccttcctagGCAIArg (749)13HCTERM20bThe length of the 3′-UTR is not included.13MCTERM131bThe length of the 3′-UTR is not included.a H, human; M, mouse; CR, cysteine-rich.b The length of the 3′-UTR is not included.

https://openalex.org/W2012486648,"MRGX is a novel transcription factor that is a member of the mortality factor 4 (MORF4)-related gene family. MRG15, a closely related family member, is in a complex with the retinoblastoma tumor suppressor protein Rb and activates the B-myb promoter, which is tightly controlled by Rb/E2F through the E2F binding site. In this study we investigated the effect of MRGX on the B-myb promoter. Interestingly, MRGX repressed the B-myb promoter in EJ cells (human bladder carcinoma cells), which have a functional Rb, but activated B-myb in HeLa cells (human cervical carcinoma cells), which express a lower amount of Rb. This repression and activation was dependent on the helix-loop-helix and leucine zipper regions of the MRGX protein but not the N-terminal region. MRGX interacts with Rb through the helix-loop-helix and leucine zipper regions. Using a treatment of trichostatin A, which is a potent inhibitor of histone deacetylase (HDAC), we determined that the repression of the B-myb promoter by MRGX in EJ cells was dependent on HDAC activity. We confirmed the association of MRGX with HDAC1 by immunoprecipitation/Western analysis and determined that MRGX complexes had HDAC activity. The data indicate that MRGX can repress or activate the B-myb promoter depending on the cell type studied, suggesting that there may be tissue-specific functions of this protein.

They share a high degree of similarity and encode motifs such as a leucine zipper (LZ), helix-loop-helix (HLH) region, nuclear localization signals, and ATP/GTP binding domains. MRG15 (amino acids 109–323) and MRGX (amino acids 74–288) proteins are 88.8% identical in this common region and most likely associate with similar proteins through this region. MRG15 and MRGX have an additional N-terminal region, and this contains a chromodomain (CHR) motif (8.Paro R. Hogness D.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

We have shown previously that MRG15 interacts with a novel protein PAM14 as well as the Rb protein, in a complex that results in derepression of the B-myb promoter in EJ (bladder carcinoma) cells (16.Leung J.K.

Deletion mutant constructs indicated that the CHR, HLH, and LZ regions of MRG15 were all necessary for this activity (16.Leung J.K. Berube N.G. Venable S. Ahmed S. Timchenko N. Pereira-Smith O.M. J.

MORF-related gene mortality factor retinoblastoma tumor suppressor helix-loop-helix leucine zipper histone deacetylase chromodomain 14-kDa protein associated with MRG glutathione S-transferase hemagglutinin histone acetyltransferase males absent on the first. To determine whether MRGX would have an effect on the B-myb promoter because it did not encode a CHR, we initiated the studies described here. The results demonstrate that MRGX can derepress the B-myb promoter in HeLa cells and that the HLH and LZ are needed for this activation. In contrast, MRGX repressed the B-myb promoter in EJ cells. This repression was lost when the HLH and LZ regions were mutated but not when the unique N-terminal region was removed. We confirmed the association of MRGX with Rb and the need for the HLH and LZ regions for the interaction by GST pulldown using EJ nuclear extract. This led us to hypothesize that the repression activity was mediated by a histone deacetylase associated with Rb and MRGX. To test this we treated the cells with trichostatin A, a HDAC specific inhibitor (18.Yoshida M. Horinouchi S. Beppu T. Bioessays. 1995; 17: 423-430Crossref PubMed Scopus (667) Google Scholar), at the time of transfection, and this resulted in a loss of the repressive activity of MRGX. Indeed by immunoprecipitation analysis, we found that HDAC1 protein and HDAC activity was associated with MRGX complexes in EJ cells. These data demonstrate that transcription factor activities vary depending on cell type, most likely because of available co-repressors or co-activators. Cells, Cell Culture, and Transfection—Cell lines used in this study were HeLa and EJ. Details of cell culture conditions have been described previously (19.Pereira-Smith O.M. Smith J.R. Somatic Cell Genet. 1982; 8: 731-742Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). A clone of EJ, which stably expresses PAM14-HA, was maintained as indicated previously (16.Leung J.K. Berube N.G. Venable S. Ahmed S. Timchenko N. Pereira-Smith O.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 39171-39178Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). For transient transfection experiments, we plated 2 × 105 cells in 35-mm tissue culture dishes and transfected them the next day using LipofectAMINE Plus (Invitrogen). Plasmid Constructs—The B-myb promoter-reporter construct was a gift from N. Dyson (Massachusetts General Hospital). To generate a MRGX expression vector for use in mammalian cells, the MRGX cDNA was amplified from cDNAs derived from human neonatal foreskin fibroblasts (HCOA2 strain derived in the Smith laboratory) using primers that incorporate EcoRV and XhoI at the 5′ and 3′ ends, respectively, and introduced this into the EcoRV/XhoI sites of pcDNA3.1 (Invitrogen). Large Deletion Mutants of MRGX—MRGX deletion mutants were cloned into the EcoRV/XhoI sites of pGEX4T1 to generate MRGX-DEL1: pGEX4T1, MRGX-DEL2:pGEX4T1, MRGX-DEL3:pGEX4T1, and MRGX-DEL LEU:pGEX4T1, respectively. Primer pairs used to create the respective constructs were: DEL1, 5′-TTT GAT ATC TAT GCA GAA GAC TCC TGG AAA-3′, DEL1, 5′-TTT CTC GAG TCA CAG GGC TTT GCG GTG GTA-3′, DEL2, 5′-TTT GAT ATC TAT GGA TGC AAT TCT GGA GGA-3′, DEL2, 5′-TTT CTC GAG TCA CAG GGC TTT GCG GTG GTA-3′, DEL3, 5′-TTT GAT ATC TAT GGA TGA GAA AAG CCT TGC-3′, DEL3, 5′-TTT CTC GAG TCA CAG GGC TTT GCG GTG GTA-3′, DEL LEU, 5′-TTT GAT ATC TAT GAG TTC CAG AAA GCA GGG-3′, and DEL LEU, 5′-TTT CTC GAG TCA GCT TTT CTC ATC AAG GGG-3′. Construction of Small Deletion/Point Mutants—To make the HLH small deletion and LZ point mutation in human MRGX, we used pcDNA 3.1 (+) hMRGX as a template for PCR mutagenesis. Primers used for PCR were: T7 promoter, 5′-TAA TAC GAC TCA CTA TAG GG-3′; BGH reverse, 5′-TAG AAG GCA CAG TCG AGG-3′ hMRGX dHS, 5′-GAC TTA GTT ACC AGG CAG AAG-3′; hMRGX dHAS, 5′-CTT CTG CCT GGT AAC TAA GTC CCA TGG TTT TAA TTC TTC-3′; hMRGX mLS, 5′-CTA AAA TAT GCG GCA AAG AAT TC-3′; and hMRGX mLAS, 5′-GAA TTC TTT TCC GCA TAT TTT AG-3′. After PCR amplification, fragments were digested by BamHI and XbaI and ligated into pcDNA 3.1(+). The HLH mutant MRGX has a 5-amino acid deletion at position 132–136 (total of 288 amino acids). The LZ mutant MRGX has a leucine to alanine mutation at position 263. All constructs were verified by sequencing. GST Pulldown Assay—The bacterial cell line BL21 (Stratagene) was transformed with the indicated plasmid, and expression of the GST fusion protein was induced by the addition of 0.1 mm isopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside for 3 h at 37 °C. A small aliquot was removed from the bacterial cultures, lysed in 2× sample buffer (150 mm Tris/HCl, pH 6.8, 2.5% SDS, 20% glycerol, 0.01% bromphenol blue), separated by SDS-PAGE, and Coomassie-stained to verify expression of the fusion proteins. The bacterial lysates were subsequently harvested and purified on Sepharose 4B-glutathione beads (Amersham Biosciences). For GST pulldown assays, EJ nuclear lysates were prepared in Nonidet P-40 lysis buffer. Bead-immobilized GST-tagged proteins were incubated with the lysates for 3 h and then washed four times in radioimmune precipitation assay buffer (150 mm NaCl, 1% Nonidet P-40, 0.1% SDS, 50 mm Tris, pH 8.0), solubilized in 2× sample buffer, run on a SDS-PAGE protein gel, and transferred to a nitrocellulose membrane (Bio-Rad) for immunoblot analysis. Luciferase Assay—This has been described in detail previously (16.Leung J.K. Berube N.G. Venable S. Ahmed S. Timchenko N. Pereira-Smith O.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 39171-39178Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar, 20.Tominaga K. Pereira-Smith O.M. Gene (Amst.). 2002; 294: 215-224Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar). In brief, the cells were transfected with the indicated plasmids, and cell lysates were prepared using reporter lysis buffer (Promega). Luciferase activities were measured using the luciferase assay kit (Promega). All data were normalized to the amount of protein in the samples. Luciferase activities were determined in triplicate, and each experiment was done at least twice. Significance of the -fold change in luciferase activity was determined by the one-way analysis of variance test. Immunoprecipitation and HDAC Activity—EJ cells were transfected with a C-terminal HA-tagged MRGX construct (pcDNA 3.1 MRGXHA). After 48 h, the cells were lysed in the lysis buffer (50 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 120 mm NaCl, 1.5 mm MgCl2, 0.4% Nonidet P-40), supplemented with a protease inhibitor mixture (Calbiochem), and kept on ice for 30 min, and total cell lysates were prepared by centrifugation at 14,000 rpm for 10 min. The lysates (500 μg) were precleared with 40 μl of ImmunoPure protein A-agarose (Pierce) for 1 h. 2 μg of rabbit anti-HA (sc-805, Santa Cruz), rabbit anti-HDAC1 (sc-7872, Santa Cruz), or rabbit anti-HIS (sc-803, Santa Cruz) was added to the precleared lysates and kept at 4 °C for 3 h. Antigen·antibody complexes were obtained by adding 40 μl of protein A-agarose for 1 h and washing with lysis buffer four times. The precipitates were applied to 10% PAGE, and proteins were transferred to nitrocellulose membrane followed by immunoblot detection. HDAC activities in the precipitates were measured using a HDAC assay kit (Upstate Biotechnology). Effect of Wild-type and Various Mutant MRGX Proteins on the B-myb Promoter in HeLa and EJ Cells—Co-transfection of MRGX with the wild-type B-myb promoter-reporter construct into HeLa cells resulted in a dose-dependent increase of luciferase activity (about 3-fold) similar to what we had observed with MRG15 in our previous studies (Fig. 1A) (16.Leung J.K. Berube N.G. Venable S. Ahmed S. Timchenko N. Pereira-Smith O.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 39171-39178Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). In contrast, increasing amounts of MRGX repressed the B-myb promoter (3–4-fold) in EJ cells (Fig. 1B) (significance is p < 0.05 by one-way analysis of variance). Analysis of luciferase activity following co-transfection with various mutant MRGX constructs (Fig. 2A) demonstrated that the HLH and LZ regions were necessary for both the derepression activity in HeLa cells (Fig. 2B) and the repression activity in EJ cells (Fig. 2C) and that the unique N-terminal domain of MRGX was not required for function in either cell type. These results were strikingly different from those obtained with MRG15, because the unique N-terminal CHR in MRG15 was essential for B-myb promoter activation (17.Pardo P.S. Leung J.K. Lucchesi J.C. Pereira-Smith O.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 50860-50866Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). It was also unexpected that the same regions of the MRGX protein were involved in activating and repressing the promoter in the different cell types. The results indicate that MRGX can act as an activator or repressor of transcriptional activity depending on the expression of other proteins in the cell.Fig. 2Small mutations in the HLH and LZ but not the N-terminal region of MRGX abolish B-myb promoter activation in HeLa cells and repression in EJ cells.A, schematic diagram of MRGX mutants, which were used in transfection experiments. MRGX DEL1 has a deletion in the N-terminal region, which is a novel region specific to MRGX. MRGX HLH5d has a deletion of five conserved amino acids in the HLH region. MRGX LA has one leucine to alanine mutation in the LZ domain. NLS, nuclear localization signal; MSL-3, male-specific lethal-3. B, wild-type (WT) and mutant MRGX were co-transfected with the B-myb promoter-reporter plasmid into HeLa cells. After 24 h, luciferase activities were measured. C, wild-type and mutant MRGX were co-transfected with the B-myb promoter-reporter plasmid into EJ cells. After 24 h, luciferase activities were measured. At least two independent experiments performed in triplicate were done for the transfections described above.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) We had found previously that MRG15 can interact with Rb through the HLH and LZ regions. These regions are highly homologous in the MRG15 and MRGX proteins. We therefore tested whether MRGX can also interact with Rb through this common C-terminal region using GST pulldown analysis of EJ nuclear extract. Fig. 3A shows the various deletion mutants used. All fusion proteins were equally expressed in Escherichia coli, and the mutant protein production was confirmed by Western analysis using an anti-GST antibody (Fig. 3B). The interaction of MRGX with Rb also occurred through the HLH and LZ regions, and the unique N-terminal region was not required (Fig. 3C). Previously, we reported that MRG15 interacted with a novel 14-kDa protein, PAM14 (16.Leung J.K. Berube N.G. Venable S. Ahmed S. Timchenko N. Pereira-Smith O.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 39171-39178Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). We investigated whether MRGX also interacts with PAM14 using GST pulldown analysis. As indicated in Fig. 3D, MRGX interacted with PAM14, and the HLH and LZ regions, but not the unique N-terminal region in MRGX, were important for this interaction similar to what we had observed with MRG15. These data indicate that Rb and PAM14 interact with the MRG proteins through a common region. Sucrose gradient analyses of the nuclear extracts of EJ cells had demonstrated that MRG15 was present in at least two complexes, MRG15-associated factor 1 and MRG15-associated factor 2 (17.Pardo P.S.

MRG15-associated factor 1 involved MRG15, Rb, and PAM14, and MRG15-associated factor 2 contained MRG15 and the histone acetyltransferase hMOF (17.Pardo P.S. Leung J.K. Lucchesi J.C.

When MRGX was analyzed on these gradients, it was found to be present in multiple fractions but not those involving hMOF (data not shown). In view of these results we determined whether a HDAC activity was associated with the repressive activity of MRGX and performed co-transfections of MRGX into EJ cells with the B-myb promoter-reporter construct. We treated the cells with trichostatin A, a specific inhibitor of HDAC, 24 h later and observed loss of the B-myb promoter repression by MRGX following the treatment (Fig. 4A). We confirmed that MRGX interacts with HDAC1 by immunoprecipitation/Western analysis, because Rb·HDAC1 complexes have been implicated in repression of E2F-activated promoters (22.Brehm A. Miska E.A.

HA-tagged MRGX co-precipitated with HDAC1 in an immunoprecipitation using anti-HA antibody. Immunoprecipitation with an unrelated anti-HIS antibody served as a control (Fig. 4B). HDAC activity in anti-HA and anti-HDAC1 immunoprecipitates was determined and was 5–10-fold greater than control in the EJ cell lysate (Fig. 4C). This HDAC1 activity was inhibited by about 80% by the addition of 250 mm sodium butyrate, an inhibitor of HDACs (data not shown). These results indicate that MRGX is present in a complex with Rb and HDAC, primarily HDAC1, and represses the B-myb promoter via the E2F binding site on this promoter. The identification of MORF4 (1.Bertram M.J. Berube N.G. Hang-Swanson X. Ran Q. Leung J.K. Bryce S. Spurgers K. Bick R.J. Baldini A. Ning Y. Clark L.J. Parkinson E.K. Barrett J.C. Smith J.R.

Ageing Dev. 2002; 123: 927-936Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar) has led to the identification of a novel, very interesting family of genes. MRG15 and MRGX, the only two other family members that are expressed, have now been found to be involved in transcriptional regulation. New data presented here demonstrate that MRGX can stimulate or repress a gene promoter depending on the context of the cell type, irrespective of the expression of MRG15. This supports many previous reports in the literature (25.Cress W.D. Seto E. J. Cell. Physiol. 2000; 184: 1-16Crossref PubMed Scopus (579) Google Scholar, 26.Varga-Weisz P. Oncogene. 2001; 20: 3076-3085Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar) that indicate the dynamic nature of nucleoprotein complexes in cells. Thus, depending on other proteins available in the cells and the composition of nucleoprotein complexes, transcriptional activity will vary. A recent report by Yamagoe et al. (27.Yamagoe S. Kanno T. Kanno Y. Sasaki S. Siegel R.M. Lenardo M.J. Humphrey G. Wang Y. Nakatani Y. Howard B.H. Ozato K. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2003; 23: 1025-1033Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar) highlights this best using fluorescence resonance energy transfer analysis. They have demonstrated that p300/CBP-associated factor, a HAT, and HDAC1 are in close proximity in HeLa cells, that HATs are integrated into a large multiprotein HDAC complex, and that the coordinated activity of the two enzymes determines the expression of genes controlled by E2F. Further, YY1 and Sp1 interact with both HATs and HDACs and acquire an activator or repressor that is dependent on the promoter context and other factors. In the case of MRGX overexpression, the activity of the HDAC complex is dominant over the HAT complex present in EJ cells. Because the N-terminal region of MRGX was not necessary for repression of the B-myb promoter, the link to a HDAC·Rb·E2F complex is strengthened, as Rb binding requires the LZ and HLH domains of the MRGX. The results have led us to propose the following model. EJ cells, which have a functional Rb, require the interaction of MRG15 with a histone acetyltransferase, such as hMOF, to modify chromatin around the B-myb promoter and permit access to the Rb/E2F site to allow for activation of the promoter. Because MRGX lacks a CHR, which we have shown is necessary to recruit hMOF, it is unable to perform this function in EJ cells and instead binds to the HDAC·Rb·E2F complex that has been described as present at E2F sites (28.Takahashi Y. Rayman J.B. Dynlacht B.D. Genes Dev. 2000; 14: 804-816Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 29.Rayman J.B. Takahashi Y. Indjeian V.B. Dannenberg J.-H. Catchpole S. Watson R.J. te Riele H. Dynlacht B.D. Genes Dev. 2002; 16: 933-947Crossref PubMed Scopus (246) Google Scholar) and represses the B-myb promoter. HeLa cells express the papilloma virus proteins E6 and E7, and Rb is inactivated and degraded by E7 in these cells. These lower Rb levels may result in lowered repression at the various E2F responsive promoters, and overexpression of increasing amounts of MRGX may be able to disrupt the complex on the B-myb promoter and activate this promoter rather than repress it in HeLa cells (30.Ikura T.

We have performed the majority of our studies with immortal cells, which are easier to transfect and analyze, to obtain information that can now be applied to normal young and senescent human cells. Determining the composition and number of nucleoprotein complexes present in normal cells should aid greatly in our understanding of normal cell aging processes versus immortalization and dysregulated growth control and of the molecular mechanisms involved in cell cycle regulation.

Although the sequence of enzymatic steps was worked out nearly 40 years ago, the stereochemistry of the uric acid degradation pathway and the catalytic properties of UGL have remained very poorly described. We now report the first direct investigation of the absolute stereochemistry of UGL catalysis. Using chiral chromatographic analyses with substrate enantiomers, we demonstrate that UGL catalysis is stereospecific for substrates with the (S)-hydroxyglycine configuration. The first potent competitive inhibitors for UGL are reported here. These inhibitors are compounds which contain a 2,4-dioxocarboxylate moiety, designed to mimic transient species produced during lyase catalysis. The most potent inhibitor, 2,4-dioxo-4-phenylbutanoic acid, exhibits a KI value of 2.2 nm and is therefore among the most potent competitive inhibitors ever reported for a lyase enzyme. New synthetic alternate substrates for UGL, which are acyl-α-hydroxyglycine compounds, are described. Based on these alternate substrates, we introduce the first assay method for monitoring UGL activity directly. Finally, we report the first putative primary nucleotide and derived peptide sequence for UGL. This sequence exhibits a high level of similarity to the fumarylacetoacetate hydrolase family of proteins.

In this pathway (Fig. 1), allantoic acid is formed from allantoin by allantoinase, Acase then converts allantoic acid to ureidoglycolate and urea, and, finally, UGL catalyzes the breakdown of ureidoglycolate to glyoxylate and urea. Acase was first found independently in frog liver by Krebs and Weil (1.Krebs H.A. Weil H. Probl. Biol. Med.

The stereochemistry of UGL catalysis, and indeed of the uric acid degradation pathway as a whole, has remained poorly described for many years. Conflicting results have been reported as to whether UGL reacts preferentially with (–)-ureidoglycolate (5.Trijbels F. Vogels G.D. Biochim. Biophys.

Moreover, allantoinase reacts with both enantiomers of allantoin, and Acase has been reported to produce ureidoglycolate exhibiting a negative rotation, but, paradoxically, to also convert ureidoglycolate exhibiting a positive rotation to glyoxylate and urea (11.Vogels G.D. van der Drift C.

We also introduce the first potent competitive inhibitors for UGL, including what is one of the most potent inhibitors ever reported for a lyase enzyme. Novel substrates are reported here, which make possible the first assay method for monitoring UGL activity directly thus greatly facilitating kinetic and mechanistic investigations. Finally, we report the first primary structural data for UGL, we demonstrate that the derived peptide sequence for UGL exhibits a high level of similarity to that of the fumarylacetoacetate hydrolase family of proteins, and we point out the close mechanistic similarities that can be visualized for the catalytic chemistries of these enzymes.

Product quantitation was by standard curve based on peak height. The column was operated at 1.5 ml/min, and the α-hydroxyglycine derivatives and their corresponding amides were detected using UV. The continuous spectrophotometric glyoxylate assay (6.Trijbels F. Vogels G.D. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1967; 132: 115-126Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar) was carried out in 150 mm MES-Na buffer, pH 7.0, containing 11 mm phenylhydrazine, various concentrations of ureidoglycolate as substrate, various concentrations of inhibitor, and equal amounts of enzyme in a total volume of 600 μl at 30 °C. The formation of glyoxylate was followed as the change in absorbance at 324 nm for 500 s. The rate of reaction was calculated using the extinction coefficient of 1.7 × 104 l/mol/cm for phenylhydrazone (43.Dixon G.H. Kornberg H.L. Biochem. J. 1959; 72: 3pGoogle Scholar).

Assays were performed in 150 mm MES-Na buffer, pH 7.0, containing various concentrations of α-hydroxyglycine derivatives and equal amounts of enzyme in a total volume of 100 μl at 30 °C. After 15 min the reactions were quenched by addition of 20 μl of 3 m HClO4 and analyzed quantitatively for amide by HPLC (C8 reversed-phase). Synthesis of the oxamate affinity column was performed as described by O'Carra and Barry (46.O'Carra P. Barry S. Methods Enzymol. 1974; 34: 598-605Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar), except that the ω-aminohexyl-agarose gel was reacted with oxalic acid and potassium hydroxide to generate potassium oxalate in situ. Isolation of UGL and Acase—Burkholderia cepacia was grown under aerobic conditions on media with allantoin as the carbon source (97% allantoin, 3% yeast extract; adapted from Trijbels and Vogels (17.Trijbels F. Vogels G.D. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1966; 113: 292-301Crossref PubMed Google Scholar)). UGL was purified from a cell-free extract obtained as the supernatant after sonication (3 by 2 min at 60% amplitude using a Branson 250 Sonifier (Danbury, CT)) of a bacteria cell suspension. The cell-free extract was applied to a DEAE-Sephacel column (2.6 × 30 cm) equilibrated with 50 mm Tris-HCl buffer, pH 6.5. Elution was achieved with a linear NaCl gradient (0–0.5 m) over 700 min. UGL was eluted from the column by ∼0.15 m NaCl. The concentrated material was applied to an oxamate affinity column (1 × 10 cm), which was equilibrated with 50 mm HEPES buffer, pH 6.0, and eluted using a linear NaCl gradient (0–1 m) over 300 min. UGL eluted very slowly from the column beginning when the NaCl concentration reached about 0.1 m. The concentrated affinity pool was loaded onto two Superose 12 HR 10/30 columns coupled in series and eluted with 50 mm HEPES buffer, pH 7.0, containing 200 mm NaCl. A final pool of purified UGL was collected from the fractions that exhibited only UGL activity. The purification procedure for UGL typically gave a 113-fold increase in specific activity and a 15% yield, with less than 0.01% residual Acase activity and one major band on SDS-PAGE (see Table I and Fig. 2).Table IPurification table for UGLSampleVolumeUGL activity, benz-α-OH-GlyaAssays for UGL activity was performed in 150 mm MES-Na buffer, pH 7.0, containing 1.5 mm benzoyl-α-hydroxyglycine (benz-α-OH-Gly) in a total volume of 200 μl at 30 °C.

Open table in a new tab Acase was also isolated from B. cepacia. Cell-free extract was obtained as described above and loaded onto a DEAE-Sephacel column equilibrated with 50 mm Tris-HCl buffer, pH 6.5, as described for UGL. Acase was eluted from the column by ∼0.25 M NaCl. The concentrated material was loaded onto the Superose-Superose columns according to the procedure described above. A final pool of purified Acase was collected from the fractions that showed only Acase activity, and the buffer was exchanged to 50 mm HEPES buffer with 0.87 mm MnSO4, pH 7.5. Purified Acase typically exhibit a specific activity of 103.0 units/mg and 33% yield. SDS-PAGE revealed that Acase was not homogeneous but did exhibit a major band at 38 kDa. Kinetic assays confirm that the final pool of purified Acase contains less than 0.3% residual UGL activity. Sequence Analysis of UGL—Automated Edman degradation chemistry was used to determine the N-terminal protein sequence (47.Hunkapiller M.W. Hewick R.M. Dreyer R.J. Hood L.E. Methods Enzymol. 1983; 91: 399-413Crossref PubMed Scopus (492) Google Scholar). PerkinElmer Life Sciences/Applied Biosystems models 492 and 494 Procise sequencers (Wellesley, MA) were employed for the degradations. The respective PTH-derivatives were identified by reversed-phase HPLC analysis in an on-line fashion employing either a PerkinElmer Life Sciences/Applied Biosystems model 140C PTH analyzer fitted with a PerkinElmer Life Sciences/Brownlee 2.1 mm inner diameter PTH-C18 column or a PerkinElmer Life Sciences/applied Biosystems model 140D PTH analyzer fitted with a PerkinElmer Life Sciences/Brownlee 0.8 mm inner diameter PTH-C18 column. The N-terminal sequence of the purified protein was obtained to 42 positions. Prior to enzymatic digestion, the UGL was desalted by applying it to an Aquapore butyl microbore (2.1 mm inner diameter) C8-RP300, reversed-phase column. Following reduction and alkylation with iodoacetic acid, UGL was digested overnight at 37 °C with trypsin (sequence grade, modified porcine; Promega, Madison, WI) at 1:10. The subsequent digestion mixture was purified on a PerkinElmer Life Sciences/Brownlee C8-RP300 microbore (1.0 mm inner diameter) reversed-phase column, and the chromatography was developed over 90 min using a gradient from 0 to 60% acetonitrile in water, 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid. The flow rate was maintained at 0.05 ml/min. Fragments were collected and characterized by sequence analysis. Stereochemistry of UGL by Chiral Chromatography—Complete conversions of reactive enantiomers by UGL were performed in 150 mm MES-Na buffer, pH 7.0, containing 7 mm racemic cinnamoyl-α-hydroxyglycine or 5 mm racemic benzoyl-α-hydroxyglycine and enzyme in a total volume of 3 ml at 37 °C. Aliquots (20 μl) were withdrawn from the incubation mixtures and analyzed qualitatively for amide by injection directly onto a C8 reversed-phase HPLC column. When complete conversion was reached (as determined by a 1 to 1 ratio between the amide and the α-hydroxyglycine peaks), the reaction mixtures were lyophilized. Lyophilized reaction mixture and racemic mixture were analyzed by chiral chromatography on a CHIRALPAK® AD™ column (4.6 × 250 mm, Chiral Technologies, Exton, PA) equipped with a CHIRALPAK® AD™ guard column (4.6 × 50 mm, Chiral Technologies). The chromatography was performed on a Waters™ LC Module I Plus system equipped with a 486 tunable UV-visible detector, a 600E multisolvent delivery system, and a 715 autosampler with a 225-μl syringe, controlled by a Millennium Chromatography Manager software package (v2.15.01, Waters, Milford, MA). HPLC analyses were performed at room temperature. The column was operated at a flow rate of 1.0 ml/min. Optical rotations were determined after collecting the purified enantiomers from the CHIRALPAK® AD™ column, by using a Jasco DIP-360 digital polarimeter (Jasco, Easton, MD). Pure (R)- and (S)-enantiomers were collected from the CHIRALPAK® AD™ column and recovered by evaporation of the mobile phase under vacuum at room temperature. Stereoselective conversion of purified enantiomers by UGL was analyzed by reversed-phase HPLC. Assays were performed in 150 mm MES-Na buffer, pH 7.0, containing purified (R)- or (S)-enantiomer of benzoyl-α-hydroxyglycine or cinnamoyl-α-hydroxyglycine and enzyme in a total volume of 170 μl at 37 °C. After 40 min the reaction was quenched by the addition of 20 μl of 3 m HClO4. The quenched reaction mixture was analyzed quantitatively for amide by HPLC (C8 reversed-phase column). A typical purification of UGL from B. cepacia is summarized in Table I. The enzyme obtained from the final gel filtration column is homogeneous as judged by SDS-PAGE (Fig. 2). Automated Edman analysis of the purified UGL provided the N-terminal sequence of the enzyme to 42 amino acids. Sequence information was also obtained for some internal fragments produced by enzymatic digestion using trypsin. Fig. 3, panel A, shows the N-terminal sequence and the sequences of six internal fragments. Fragments 28 and 17 are very short, and their sequences are contained within fragment 30. The ambiguity within fragment 35 precluded its use in protein data base searching. A computer-based sequence alignment search (TblastN v2.0MP-WashU) of the ongoing genome sequencing project for B. cepacia 2B. cepacia Sequencing Project (as of 12/3/02), Sanger Centre, Hinxton, UK, www.sanger.ac.uk/Projects/B_cepacia/ identified significant similarity (E = 1.6 × 10–15, 5.1 × 10–5, 0.0086, and 0.26) between the N-terminal sequence and three of the internal fragments (fragments 30, 22, and 24) with portions of one of the contigs (Bcep825a04.p2n33). As is evident from Fig. 3, panel B, there is a 90–100% identity between the N-terminal sequence, the fragments, and portions of the contig. The open reading frame containing our N-terminal sequence and these fragments was identified and is referred to here as “hypothetical UGL” from B. cepacia. An expanded sequence alignment search (BLASTP v2.2.4 NCBI-psiblast (49.Altschul S.F. Madden T.L. Schäffer A.A. Zhang J. Zhang Z. Miller W. Lipman D.J.

Overbeek R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 443-448Crossref PubMed Scopus (450) Google Scholar) (Fig. 3,Fig. 3, panel C). There is 62% identity between these three proteins. Because of this high level of sequence similarity, hypothetical UGL was used in a search for protein families that share this sequence (HMMER 2.2, Pfam data base as of 12/5/02 (52.Eddy S.R. Bioinformatics. 1998; 14: 755-763Crossref PubMed Scopus (4105) Google Scholar)). The result was a very good match (E = 6.2 × 10–82)tothe fumarylacetoacetate hydrolase family of proteins (pfam0157). This family consists of fumarylacetoacetate hydrolase, and it also includes 2-hydroxyhepta-2,4-diene-1,7-dioateisomerase/5-carboxymethyl-2-oxohex-3-ene-1,7-dioatedecarboxylase from Escherichia coli strain W. Stereospecificity of UGL Catalysis—The stereospecificity of UGL catalysis was investigated using chiral chromatography. In these experiments we utilized two novel synthetic substrates for UGL-benzoyl-α-hydroxyglycine and cinnamoyl-α-hydroxyglycine; each of these substrates is enzymatically converted by UGL to the corresponding amide (see below). Fig. 4, panel A, shows the elution profile of racemic benzoyl-α-hydroxyglycine on a CHIRALPAK® AD™ column, resolved using 92.5% hexane, 7.5% ethanol, 0.15% trifluoroacetic acid. Baseline separation of the two enantiomers was obtained under these elution conditions. Enzymatic conversion with the enzyme peptidylamidoglycolate lyase (PGL, EC 4.3.2.5), which we have previously shown to react only with the (S)-α-hydroxyglycine moiety (40.Ping D. Mounier C.E.

Commun. 1992; : 625-626Crossref Scopus (19) Google Scholar), was used to establish that the peak eluting at 37.2 min represents the (S)-enantiomer of benzoyl-α-hydroxyglycine. After reaction of racemic benzoyl-α-hydroxyglycine with UGL until no further enzymatic conversion could be detected, the chromatogram shown in Fig. 4, panel B, was obtained. It is evident from the disappearance of the peak at 37.2 min that UGL reacts preferentially with the (S)-enantiomer. A similar experiment was performed using cinnamoyl-α-hydroxyglycine and the results are shown in panels C and D of Fig. 4. Panel C shows base-line separation of the enantiomers of racemic cinnamoyl-α-hydroxyglycine obtained on the CHIRALPAK® AD™ column, using 90% acetonitrile, 10% isopropanol, 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid as the eluent. Once again, enzymatic conversion with PGL was used to establish that the peak eluting at 12.0 min represents the (S)-enantiomer. After complete reaction of racemic cinnamoyl-α-hydroxyglycine with UGL (panel D), the disappearance of the peak for the (S)-enantiomer again verifies preferential UGL reactivity toward the (S)-hydroxyglycine moiety. To unequivocally demonstrate the stereospecificity of UGL for the (S)-enantiomers of benzoyl-α-hydroxyglycine and cinnamoyl-α-hydroxyglycine, and to confirm that the expected corresponding amide products are actually being formed from UGL turnover, the experiments shown in Fig. 5 were carried out. Pure enantiomers of benzoyl-α-hydroxyglycine and cinnamoyl-α-hydroxyglycine were individually collected from the CHIRALPAK® AD™ column. Fig. 5, panel A, shows chromatograms obtained by reversed-phase HPLC after UGL was incubated with the purified (R)- or (S)-enantiomer of benzoyl-α-hydroxyglycine, respectively. Benzoyl-α-hydroxyglycine elutes at 3.4 min, and the benzamide product elutes at 4.8 min. Stereospecific catalysis by UGL is evident from the 98% conversion of the (S)-enantiomer, while less than 3% of the (R)-enantiomer is converted to product. A similar experiment was performed using cinnamoyl-α-hydroxyglycine, and the results are shown in panel B of Fig. 5; in the chromatograms in panel B cinnamoyl-α-hydroxyglycine elutes at 5.4 min and the cinnamamide product elutes at 8.2 min. Stereospecific catalysis by UGL is again evident from the 97% conversion of the (S)-enantiomer, while less than 8% of the (R)-enantiomer is converted. New Alternate Substrates for UGL—The natural substrates for UGL and Acase are ureidoglycolate and allantoate, respectively. We investigated the reactivities of a number of acyl-α-hydroxyglycine compounds as potential alternate substrates for these enzymes. We anticipated that appropriately designed alternate substrates would enable facile direct assay of these enzymes by HPLC, thus obviating the need for the coupled assays used by previous investigators (29.Vogels G.D. van der Drift C.

The N-terminal DNA transesterase domain of TraI localizes the protein to nic and cleaves this site within the plasmid transfer origin. In the cell the C-terminal DNA helicase domain of TraI is essential for driving the 5′ to 3′ unwinding of plasmid DNA from nic to provide the strand destined for transfer. In vitro, however, purified TraI protein cannot enter and unwind nicked plasmid DNA and instead requires a 5′ tail of single-stranded DNA at the duplex junction. In this study we evaluate the extent of single-stranded DNA adjacent to the duplex that is required for efficient TraI-catalyzed DNA unwinding in vitro. A series of linear partial duplex DNA substrates containing a central stretch of single-stranded DNA of defined length was created and its structure verified. We found that substrates containing ≥27 nucleotides of single-stranded DNA 5′ to the duplex were unwound efficiently by TraI, whereas substrates containing 20 or fewer nucleotides were not. These results imply that during conjugation localized unwinding of >20 nucleotides at nic is necessary to initiate unwinding of plasmid DNA strands.

The TraI protein of IncF plasmids contributes to conjugative transfer in several ways. It is a component of a nucleoprotein complex, the relaxosome, which assembles with site specificity at the plasmid origin of transfer (oriT). Relaxosomes initiate the series of DNA-processing reactions that prepare plasmid DNA for transfer to a recipient cell. They are common to all self-transmissible and mobilizable plasmids in different degrees of complexity (for reviews, see Refs. 8.Zechner E.L. de la Cruz F. Eisenbrandt R. Grahn A.M. Koraimann G.

The simplest systems employ a plasmid-encoded DNA transesterase, or relaxase, protein that acts on a specific phosphodiester bond, nic, in the transfer origin. Cleavage at this site provides a point of origin for the directed 5′ to 3′ transmission of the plasmid genome to a recipient cell. Relaxase proteins are also active in relaxosomes containing auxiliary DNA-binding proteins of host or plasmid origin. IncF, IncW, IncP, and IncQ systems offer well studied examples (12.Kline B.C.

As revealed by very recent structural data, the endonuclease domain of adeno-associated virus-5 Rep proteins (36.Hickman A.B. Ronning D.R. Kotin R.M. Dyda F. Mol.

Adeno-associated virus-2 Rep78 protein and an alternative splicing product, Rep68, bind the viral replicative form origin of replication, cleave the target DNA in a site and strand-specific manner, and mediate vectorial unwinding of the DNA duplex via an ATP-dependent helicase activity, thus initiating a strand displacement mechanism of viral DNA replication. The N-terminal 224 amino acids of Rep78/68 (39.Owens R.A. Weitzman M.D. Kyostio S.R. Carter B.J. J. Virol. 1993; 67: 997-1005Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) are involved in interaction with recognition sequences (resolution binding sites) in the viral terminal repeats and in the viral integration site on human chromosome 19 (40.Linden R.M.

This protein cleaves with site and strand specificity the terminal resolution site, trs, near resolution binding sites. The helicase activity of Rep78/68 has 3′ to 5′ polarity and is believed to assist the initiation of adeno-associated virus DNA replication at several stages including modifying the terminal repeat hairpin before nicking at trs, conversion of the terminal repeat region from the linear to hairpin form, and finally, possibly as a replicative helicase during synthesis of the viral genome (41.Zhou X.

The conjugative helicases initiate duplex unwinding unidirectionally from the plasmid transfer origin after strand-specific cleavage at nic by their N-terminal relaxase domains. The molecular mechanisms of these early steps of plasmid strand transfer remain poorly understood.

Nonetheless, the product of that reaction, the open circular form, is not directly accessible to the duplex unwinding activity of the physically linked DNA helicase domain. Thus, although recruitment of the conjugative helicase to oriT is achieved by site-specific recognition of the N-terminal relaxase domain and/or via interaction with additional oriT binding auxiliary proteins, the reaction as reconstituted thus far fails to effectively load the helicase at nic (45.Byrd D.R. Matson S.W. Mol. Microbiol. 1997; 25: 1011-1022Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). In the cell, then, the relaxosome probably acquires a higher order structure in a staged initiation process that triggers helicase activation, similar perhaps to the orchestrated unwinding of origin DNA during replication initiation in prokaryotic and eukaryotic cells (46.Konieczny I. EMBO Rep. 2003; 4: 37-41Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). Purified TraI and TrwC proteins do not exhibit sequence specificity for binding and translocating (5′ to 3′) on ssDNA (29.Grandoso G. Llosa M. Zabala J.C. de la Cruz F. Eur. J.

Reconstitution of the duplex-unwinding activity in vitro requires a region of ssDNA adjacent to the duplex (49.Abdel-Monem M. Lauppe H.F. Kartenbeck J. Durwald H. Hoffmann-Berling H. J. Mol. Biol. 1977; 110: 667-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). In early work Hoffmann-Berling and co-workers (47.Kuhn B. Abdel-Monem M. Krell H. Hoffmann-Berling H. J. Biol. Chem. 1979; 254: 11343-11350Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) estimated that the length of ssDNA required by TraI on the duplex 5′ end lies within an approximate range of 12–200 nt. At the time partial duplexes were generated by exonucleolytic erosion of flush termini, and technical limitations prevented a narrower definition of this requirement for TraI. To gain insights to the extent of localized duplex unwinding that may occur to start plasmid DNA strand transfer, we have investigated the length requirement for ssDNA within a linear duplex necessary for efficient TraI-catalyzed DNA unwinding. We find that single-stranded regions shorter than 27 nt do not support efficient helicase activity. Expression and Purification of R1 TraI—The expression construction pHP2 (50.Zechner E.L. Prüger H.

Balzer D. Lurz R. Waters V.L. Guiney D.G. Lanka E. J. Bacteriol. 1992; 174: 2493-2500Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Cultures (600 ml) of E. coli SCS1[pHP2] were grown at 37 °C in 2× TY (16 g/liter Bacto-Tryptone, 10 g/liter Bacto yeast extract, 5 g/liter NaCl) medium (52.Miller J.H. Experiments in Molecular Genetics. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1972: 433Google Scholar) supplemented with 0.1% (w/v) glucose, 25 mm MOPS (pH 8.0), 25 μg/ml thiamine/HCl, and 10 μg/ml chloramphenicol. At an A600 of 0.5, isopropyl-1-thio-α-d-galactopyranoside was added to a concentration of 1 mm. Shaking of cells was continued at 30 °C for 5 h. Cells were harvested by centrifugation and resuspended in a total volume of 100 ml of 20 mm spermidine, 200 mm NaCl, and 2 mm EDTA (pH 8.0) and frozen at –20 °C. Frozen cells were thawed overnight at 4 °C, and the suspension was adjusted to final concentrations of 50 mm Tris/HCl (pH 7.6), 30 mm NaCl, 5% (v/v) sucrose, 0.15% (v/v) Brij-58, 275 μg/ml lysozyme, and 0.1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride. After 1 h at 0 °C the lysis mixture was centrifuged at 100,000 × g for 90 min at 4 °C. Solid ammonium sulfate was slowly added to the supernatant to 50% saturation (0.29 mg/ml), stirred for 30 min on ice, and then centrifuged 27,000 × g for 30 min at 4 °C. The precipitate was dissolved in a total volume of 40 ml in buffer A (20 mm Tris/HCl (pH 7.6), 10% glycerol (v/v), 0.1 mm EDTA, 1 mm DTT, and 50 mm NaCl). Fraction I was dialyzed against 3 changes of a 5-fold volume of buffer A for 3 h. The dialyzed fraction was loaded on a Pharmacia HiTrap™ heparin-Sepharose column. Proteins were eluted with a 0.05–1.2 m gradient of NaCl using buffer B (20 mm Tris/HCl (pH 7.6), 10% glycerol (v/v), 0.1 mm EDTA, 1 mm DTT, 1.2 m NaCl). TraI eluted at 415 mm NaCl (fraction II). Soluble ammonium sulfate was added to a final concentration of 1 m, and the mixture was applied to a phenyl-Sepharose column equilibrated with buffer C (20 mm Tris/HCl (pH 7.6), 10% glycerol (v/v), 0.1 mm EDTA, 1 mm DTT, and 1 m (NH4)2SO4). The protein was eluted using a decreasing gradient of 1 to 0 m (NH4)2SO4 in buffer D (20 mm Tris/HCl (pH 7.6), 10% glycerol (v/v), 0.1 mm EDTA, and 1 mm DTT). The TraI protein eluted at ∼250 mm (NH4)2SO4 (fraction III). Peak fractions were pooled, dialyzed against buffer D, concentrated against polyethylene glycol 20000 supplemented with glycerol to a final concentration of 40% (v/v), and stored at –20 °C (fraction IV). This fraction was greater than 90% pure TraI protein based on Coomassie-stained polyacrylamide-denaturing gels. Protein concentration was determined using the Bradford protein assay (Bio-Rad) with bovine serum albumin as standard. ATPase Assay—The γ-phosphohydrolase activity of partially purified protein fractions was determined in a 25-μl reaction mixture containing 25 fmol of circular single-stranded f1 DNA effector, 25 mm Tris/HCl (pH 7.5), 20 mm NaCl, 3 mm MgCl2, 5 mm β-mercaptoethanol, ∼0.66 pmol of [γ-32P]ATP (1.85 × 103 cpm/pmol), and 2 mm unlabeled ATP. Components were combined in a volume sufficient for 13 reactions and warmed to 30 °C. The reaction was started by the addition of ∼60 ng of protein/25-μl reaction mixture. Aliquots (25 μl) were removed at 0, 0.5, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 7, 9, 11, 13, 15, and 20 min, and the reaction was stopped by the addition of ice-cold EDTA to 85 mm.6-μl aliquots were spotted on polyethyleneimine-cellulose TLC plates and developed in 1 m LiCl to separate inorganic phosphate from the mono-, di-, and triphosphates. The extent of ATP hydrolysis was quantified using a PhosphorImager and ImageQuant software (Molecular Dynamics). Preparation of Helicase Substrates—Linear partial duplex substrates containing a single-stranded gap were prepared in several steps. Three dsDNA fragments (A, B, C) were generated in independent PCR reactions performed with 200 μm each dNTP, 20 ng of pBluescript II SK DNA (Stratagene), 0.2 μm each primer (Table I), and 1 unit of Dynazyme II polymerase (Finnzymes) in the buffer provided. To render one strand in each fragment sensitive to subsequent exonuclease attack, one primer in each pair was 5′-phosphorylated before amplification. The reverse primer used to amplify fragment A and the forward primers employed to create fragments B and C were phosphorylated nonradioactively by T4 polynucleotide kinase and reisolated using mini Quick Spin™ columns (Roche Applied Science). PCR products A and B were common to every substrate. Product C was unique for each because the site of annealing of the forward primer in each case was positioned a few nt further removed on the template pBluescript DNA relative to the reverse primer, which was constant for each preparation. Product C for all substrates was radiolabeled internally by adding [α-32P]dATP to the PCR reaction mixture. The conditions for amplification were 94 °C for 3 min then 30 cycles at 94 °C for 30 s, 60 °C for 40 s, and 72 °C for 1 min followed by one step at 72 °C for 5 min. For the 30ss and 40ss substrates 55 °C annealing temperature was required. The 5′-phosphorylated strand of each PCR fragment was then selectively degraded by 5 units of λ exonuclease III (New England Biolabs)/20-μl PCR reaction mix at 37 °C for 1 h. After nuclease treatment, the products were purified with Qiagen PCR purification kits. The yield and concentration of ssDNA were determined on 1.4% agarose Tris borate EDTA gels. To create the partial linear duplex DNA substrates, the three protected strands of fragments A, B, and C were combined at a molar ratio of 3:3:1 in 10 mm Tris/HCl (pH 8.5) and 200 mm NaCl and heat-denatured at 94 °C for 5 min. Annealing was achieved in reiterated cycles of decreasing temperature (1 °C over four 25-s increments per cycle) to a final temperature of 16 °C. This hybridization mix was used directly in helicase assays or stored at –20 °C.Table IOligonucleotides used in this studyA for5′-GCGGGCCTCTTCGCTATTACG-3′A rev5′-CCTGCGTTATCCCCTGATTCTGTG-3′B5′-CAATTCGCCCTATAGTGAGTCG-3′12ss5′-CCCCTCGAGGTCGACGG-3′16ss5′-TCGAGGTCGACGGTATCG-3′20ss5′-GGTCGACGGTATCGATAAGC-3′27ss5′-GGTATCGATAAGCTTGATATCG-3′30ss5′-ATCGATAAGCTTGATATCGAATTCC-3′40ss5′-TTGATATCGAATTCCTGCAGC-3′67ss5′-GATCCACTAGTTCTAGAGCG-3′ Open table in a new tab Verification of Partial Duplex Substrate Structure—Typical nuclease reaction mixtures (20 μl) contained 3–3.5 ng (375 pm) of intermediate products or hybridized helicase substrates and 2.5 units (S1 nuclease and HindII), 4 units (XhoI and NotI), 5 units (ApaI), or 7.5 units (PstI, PvuII, and HindIII) of enzyme. All enzymes and buffers were supplied by Takara. Incubation was at 37 °C for 1 h except S1 nuclease (30 min). The products were resolved with 1.4% agarose gels in Tris borate EDTA buffer at 7 V/cm for 2.5 h. Mixtures of dsDNA fragments of known length radioactively end-labeled using T4 polynucleotide kinase and [γ-32P]ATP were used as standards for gel mobility. Radiolabeled DNA species were visualized by autoradiography of the dried gels. Helicase Assay—Standard reactions (20 μl) were performed at 37 °C for 20 min in a solution containing 40 mm Tris/HCl (pH 7.5), 4 mm MgCl2, 1 mm DTT, 10% glycerol, 50 μg/ml bovine serum albumin, 1.8 mm ATP, ∼3–3.5 ng of DNA (375 pm) substrates, and 0–52 nm TraI. For kinetic studies carried out in the presence of 52 nm enzyme a scaled-up (14-fold) reaction mixture was assembled and warmed to 37 °C, and the reaction was started by the addition of protein. Portions (20 μl) were removed at 0.5, 1, 1.5, 2, 3, 4, 5, 7.5, 10, 12.5, 15, and 20 min, and the reactions were stopped by the addition of 0.2 volumes of loading buffer (50 mm EDTA, 50% glycerol, 1% SDS, and 0.1% bromphenol blue). The products were resolved on 1.4% agarose gels in Tris borate EDTA buffer at 7 V/cm for 2.5 h. Radiolabeled DNA was visualized by autoradiography of the dried gels. Data were quantified using ImageQuant software (Molecular Dynamics). The percent unwound helicase substrate was determined after background correction: % unwound = signal intensity in displaced fragment divided by total substrate signal. Expression, Purification, and ATPase Activity of R1 TraI Protein—TraI was overexpressed in E. coli SCS1 and purified from crude cell extracts as described under “Experimental Procedures.” The final fraction contained a greater than 90% homogeneous solution of TraI as judged by SDS-PAGE and Coomassie Blue staining (data not shown). The purified protein exhibited an apparent molecular mass of 180 kDa. Typically, 20–25 mg of protein were obtained from 4.8 liters of cultured cells. Extensive studies have characterized the NTPase activity of TraI from plasmid F (97% identity between predicted proteins) (53.Abdel-Monem M. Hoffmann-Berling H. Eur. J. Biochem. 1976; 65: 431-440Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar, 54.Abdel-Monem M. Dürwald H. Hoffmann-Berling H. Eur. J. Biochem. 1976; 65: 441-449Crossref PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar). In good agreement with these reports the ATPase activity of TraI from plasmid R1 was dependent on the presence of a ssDNA effector and activated by Mg2+. In the presence of 2 mm ATP maximal activity was observed at 2 mm MgCl2, and half-maximal values were obtained at 0.3 and 20 mm MgCl2 (not shown). One unit of enzymatic activity is defined as the amount of enzyme needed to hydrolyze 1 nm ATP in 20 min at 30 °C. The progress of the purification procedure was monitored by measuring the ATPase activity at the later stages, as summarized in Table II. A specific activity of 1970 kilounits/mg was determined for the final fraction containing TraI.Table IIPurification of R1TraIStepsVolumeTotal proteinSpecific activitymlmgkilounits/mgI.

To evaluate the requirement of this enzyme for a 5′ ssDNA tail, we chose to create a series of linear partial duplex substrates containing a centrally located single-stranded gap of variable length. Duplex arms were generated by hybridizing two distinct non-overlapping single-stranded fragments to one common longer fragment of complementary ssDNA as illustrated in Fig. 1. To be able to control the gap size precisely, the position of the 5′ end of the primer utilized to amplify fragment C was varied incrementally relative to the start of the left arm duplex (Fig. 1B). A series of partial duplex molecules were generated with this approach that differed only in the defined length of the single-stranded region present after hybridization. The structure of the resulting products was verified based on nuclease sensitivity (Fig. 2). The oriT region of IncF(II) plasmid R1 is essentially devoid of commonly used restriction endonuclease cleavage sites. Utilization of this DNA for creating suitable helicase substrates would make verification of the gap size in each substrate prohibitively difficult. Therefore, pBluescript DNA was chosen to be able to exploit the dense arrangement of restriction endonuclease recognition sites in the multiple cloning site when these are positioned in and around the single-stranded gap of the partial duplex hybridization products. For each substrate preparation sensitivity of intermediate products and the product of their hybridization to restriction endonucleases and single strand-specific nuclease S1 was analyzed. The results for three of the seven different substrates used in this study are presented in detail. In Fig. 2A the structure of the hybridization product expected to contain a single-stranded gap 67 nt in length is demonstrated. Importantly, for every substrate just one of the component ssDNA fragments was radiolabeled. Thus, not all DNA species are visible in the autoradiogram. The different DNA species present after λ-exonuclease III treatment of the pooled PCR products before their hybridization (lane 2) were also treated with several nucleases and resolved electrophoretically through non-denaturing agarose gels (lanes 3–6). The fastest and the slowest migrating labeled species were insensitive to restriction endonucleases (lanes 3–5) but were completely degraded by S1 nuclease (lane 6). In contrast, the band migrating somewhat less than the 405-bp double-stranded standard DNA fragment (lane 13) was resistant to S1 nuclease (lane 6). Treatment with PstI did not alter the appar"
https://openalex.org/W2090968930,"We have previously shown that myogenesis induction by Arg8-vasopressin (AVP) in L6 rat myoblasts involves a sustained stimulation of type 4 cAMP-phosphodiesterase. In this model, we observed that a transient cAMP generation occurs in the minutes following AVP addition. Evidence suggests that cAMP generation is due to the prostaglandins produced in response to AVP binding to V1a receptors and subsequent activation of phospholipase A2. The early cAMP increase was effective in activating cAMP-dependent protein kinase (PKA) and increasing phosphorylation of CREB transcription factor. Inhibition of PKA by compound H89 prior to AVP addition led to a significant reduction of expression of the differentiation marker creatine kinase, whereas H89 added 1-5 h after AVP had no significant effect. Furthermore, PKA inhibition 24 h after the beginning of AVP treatment potentiated differentiation. This shows that both an early activation and a later down-regulation of the cAMP pathway are required for AVP induction of myogenesis. Because phosphodiesterase PDE4D3 overexpressed in L6 cells lost its ability to potentiate AVP-induced differentiation when mutated and rendered insensitive to PKA phosphorylation and activation, we hypothesize that the early cAMP increase is required to trigger the down-regulation of cAMP pathway through stimulation of phosphodiesterase.

Myogenic differentiation of myoblasts is a complex process resulting in the formation of multinucleated myotubes expressing an array of muscle-specific proteins. It takes place both in the course of normal embryonic development and during repair of lesions caused by muscle injuries or degeneration occurring in muscular dystrophies (1.Perry R.L. Rudnick M.A. Front. Biosci. 2000; 5: D750-D767Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Several hormonal factors have been shown to positively influence the myogenic process in vivo or in vitro. Among them, the neuropituitary hormone vasopressin (AVP) 1The abbreviations used are: AVPArg8-vasopressinDMEMDulbecco's modified Eagle's mediumPDEcAMP-phosphodiesterasePKAcAMP-dependent protein kinaserolipram4-(3-[cyclopentyloxy] 4-methoxyphenyl)-2-pyrrolidinoneBSAbovine serum albuminFBSfetal bovine serumIBMXisobutylmethylxanthinePBSphosphate-buffered salineCREBcAMP-responsive element-binding protein.1The abbreviations used are: AVPArg8-vasopressinDMEMDulbecco's modified Eagle's mediumPDEcAMP-phosphodiesterasePKAcAMP-dependent protein kinaserolipram4-(3-[cyclopentyloxy] 4-methoxyphenyl)-2-pyrrolidinoneBSAbovine serum albuminFBSfetal bovine serumIBMXisobutylmethylxanthinePBSphosphate-buffered salineCREBcAMP-responsive element-binding protein. appears particularly interesting, because it induces myogenic differentiation of rat myoblast lines and mouse satellite cells in the absence of other factors (2.Minotti S. Scicchitano B.M. Nervi C. Scarpa S. Lucarelli M. Molinaro M. Adamo S. Cell Growth Diff. 1998; 9: 155-163PubMed Google Scholar). The signaling pathways triggered by AVP in L6-C5 myogenic cells include phospholipase C and phospholipase D activation (3.Teti A. Naro F. Molinaro M. Adamo S. Am. J.

Cell Physiol. 1997; 171: 34-42Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). We also reported that AVP-induced differentiation requires a prolonged activation of type 4 phosphodiesterase (PDE4) and a reduction of cAMP levels and PKA activity occurring after several hours of AVP treatment of myogenic cells (5.Naro F. Sette C. Vicini E. De Arcangelis V. Grange M. Conti M. Lagarde M. Molinaro M. Adamo S. Nemoz G. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1999; 10: 4355-4367Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar), in agreement with studies showing that a sustained elevation of cAMP levels exerts a potent inhibitory effect on myogenic differentiation (6.Li L. Heller-Harrison R. Czech M. Olson E.N. Mol. Cell Biol. 1992; 12: 4478-4485Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar, 7.Winter B. Braun T. Arnold H.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 9869-9878Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Phosphodiesterases of the PDE4 family, and especially the isoform PDE4D3, ensure a tight control of cAMP levels in L6-C5 cells and are positive effectors of the myogenic response (5.Naro F. Sette C. Vicini E. De Arcangelis V. Grange M. Conti M. Lagarde M. Molinaro M. Adamo S. Nemoz G. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1999; 10: 4355-4367Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar, 8.De Arcangelis V. Coletti D.

However, the signaling cascades triggered by AVP in myoblasts are still largely unknown, and in particular, the delineation of the complex role played by the cAMP pathway remains incomplete. In fact, despite its recognized inhibitory effect on myogenic differentiation, it has been reported that cAMP intracellular levels and PKA activity rise at the onset of myogenesis (9.Zalin R.J. Montague W. Exp. Cell Res. 1975; 93: 55-62Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar, 10.Marchal S. Cassar-Malek I. Magaud J.P. Rouault J.P. Wrutniak C. Cabello G. Exp.

Thus, it seems of importance to better understand the involvement of cAMP in the control of muscle formation. The recent description of alterations in the expression of genes involved in several signaling pathways, including the cAMP pathway, that have been noticed in muscular tissue of patients affected by dystrophic diseases (12.Haslett J.N.

In the present work, we describe early AVP effects on cAMP levels in L6-C5 cells and address the possible physiological meanings of the observed changes. Contrary to longer term observations, in the first few minutes of stimulation, AVP induced a marked and transient cAMP accumulation. We identified an indirect mechanism of cyclase stimulation by AVP in these cells involving prostaglandin synthesis, and we made observations indicating that although short-lived, the early cAMP surge has a physiological relevance and exerts a positive influence on the myogenic process. We hypothesize that an important effect of the early cAMP production is to trigger the activation of phosphodiesterase PDE4D3 resulting in the later down-regulation of the cAMP pathway.

The cells were routinely seeded at the density of 10,000/cm2 in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (DMEM) containing 4500 mg/ml glucose, supplemented with 100 units/ml penicillin, 100 μg/ml streptomycin, and 10% heat-inactivated FBS. Twenty-four hours after plating, the cultures were extensively washed with DMEM and shifted to serum-free medium consisting of DMEM supplemented with 1% (w/v) fatty acid-free BSA, with or without other additions. Full terminal myogenic differentiation was morphologically evaluated after 6 days by assessing the presence of multinucleated myotubes in May Grunwald-Giemsa stained cultures. To evaluate cell differentiation by quantification of specific markers, either the cells were homogenized in 30 mm HEPES, 1 mm EDTA, pH 7.2 buffer and creatine kinase activity was assessed as described in Ref. 2.Minotti S.

Cell Growth Diff. 1998; 9: 155-163PubMed Google Scholar, or the cells were homogenized in RIPA buffer and myosin heavy chain content was evaluated by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay, using MF20 as the primary antibody, as described in (5.Naro F. Sette C. Vicini E. De Arcangelis V. Grange M. Conti M. Lagarde M. Molinaro M. Adamo S. Nemoz G. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1999; 10: 4355-4367Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). cAMP Assay—The cells cultured for 24 h in 1% BSA medium without addition were treated for different times with 10-6m AVP in the presence or absence of various agents, as stated in figure legends. Before harvesting, the cells were washed twice with cold PBS, and 0.5 ml of ice-cold 10% trichloroacetic acid was added. The cell extracts were collected and centrifuged at 10,000 × g for 15 min. The supernatants were extracted five times with diethyl ether to eliminate trichloroacetic acid. cAMP was assayed by radioimmunoassay, according to the manufacturer's recommendations, using the acetylation procedure. The trichloroacetic acid pellets were used to quantify proteins by the Bradford microassay. Reverse Transcriptase-PCR—Total RNA was prepared from quiescent L6-C5 myoblasts (i.e. cells cultured for 48 h in 1% BSA medium), myotubes (cells cultured for 6 d in the presence of 10-7m AVP), or rat kidney or liver using Trizol reagent as advised by the manufacturer (Invitrogen). 5 μg of RNA from each sample was reverse transcribed using Moloney murine leukemia virus reverse transcriptase (Invitrogen) and p(dT)10 primer (Roche Applied Science). The following primers, designed according to the nucleotide sequences of rat V1a vasopressin receptor cDNA (GenBank™ GI:16554454) and of rat V2 vasopressin receptor cDNA (GenBank™ GI:9506414) were used to amplify cDNAs: Pair 1 (V1aR nucleotides 1381-1530), sense 5′-AAATTCGCCAAGGATGACTC-3′, and antisense 5′-TGGGGCTCAAGTGGAGACAG-3′; Pair 2 (V2R nucleotides 676-1116), sense 5′-GTTCTTATCTTCCGGGAGATAC-3′, and antisense 5′-TCAGGAGGGTGTATCCTTCATC-3′. PCRs were carried out with 2.5 units/sample of platinum Taq polymerase (Invitrogen), by performing 27 amplification cycles of 94 °C for 30 s, 57 °C (for V1aR) or 54 °C (for V2R) for 40 s, and 68 °C for 50 s. Integrity and equal cDNA loading in the PCR was checked by quantification of β-actin mRNA levels, by using primers designed according to mouse cytoskeletal β-actin cDNA sequence (GI:49865), to obtain a 355-bp band (sense, nucleotides 309-330, 5′-ACCAACTGGGACGACATGGAG-3′; and antisense, nucleotides 693-663, 5′-GGTCAGGATCTTCATGAGGTAGTC-3′). The PCR products were analyzed on a 2% agarose gel. Transfection Experiments—Transient transfections were performed by using FuGene 6™ according to the manufacturer's instructions (Roche Applied Science). Briefly, the pCDNA3-V1aR construct or empty vector (1 μg each in a total volume of 20 μl in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium) were mixed with diluted FuGene reagent (97 μl of serum-free medium with 3 μl of FuGene) and incubated for 15 min. The DNA-FuGene mix was then added dropwise to 200,000 COS-1 cells/ml in suspension. The transfected cells were seeded and incubated for an additional 48 h in 10% FBS-containing DMEM. They were then switched to BSA medium and received 0.5 mm IBMX and, after 10 min, 10-6m AVP. After 15 min of incubation at 37 °C, the cell extracts were prepared and assayed for cAMP content as described above. L6-C5 cells were transiently transfected with either pCMV5-PDE4D3 construct, pCMV5-S54A-PDE4D3 (15.Sette C. Conti M. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 16526-16534Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (356) Google Scholar), or the empty vector, in the same conditions as above. After 16 h of culture in FBS medium, they were shifted to BSA medium and cultured for 6 h in the presence or absence of 10-7m AVP. Myogenic differentiation was evaluated by assessing the nuclear myogenin content of the cells by immunofluorescence. The cells were fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde in PBS for 30 min at 4 °C and permeabilized in 0.2% Triton X-100 in PBS for 30 min. They were washed with 1% BSA in PBS and incubated overnight at room temperature with the undiluted supernatant of F5D hybridoma cells (developed by Dr. W. E. Wright, University of Texas, Dallas, obtained from the Developmental Studies Hybridoma Bank maintained by the University of Iowa, Department of Biological Sciences, Iowa City, IA). After washing with 1% BSA in PBS, the cells were incubated for 1 h at room temperature with rhodamin-conjugated goat anti-mouse IgG (Cappel Laboratories, West Chester, PA) and examined by fluorescence microscopy. Analysis of Arachidonate Metabolism—The cells cultured for 24 h in 1% BSA medium were incubated for 2 h in the presence of 0.5 μCi/ml of [14C]arachidonic acid dissolved in DMEM without FBS or BSA. Radioactivity of the culture medium was then measured to assess the incorporation of the fatty acid (usually 80-90%). The cells were washed with 0.5% BSA in DMEM, equilibrated for 15 min in the same medium, and treated for 5 min with 10-7m AVP at 37 °C. The radioactivity of the medium was then determined on aliquots to evaluate the amount of arachidonate and metabolites released. The remainder was acidified to pH 3-4 with HCl and extracted two times by 3 volumes of ethyl acetate containing 50 μm butyl-hydroxytoluene. Pooled organic phases were evaporated under nitrogen stream, and the lipid extract was analyzed by thin layer chromatography on a Silica gel plate (Merck) with water-saturated ethyl acetate, iso-octane, acetic acid (110:50:20) as eluent. The dry plate was treated by iodine vapors to detect lipid standards and then autoradiographed for 6 weeks at -75 °C using Hyperfilm MP (Amersham Biosciences). Protein Kinase A Activity—Protein kinase A activity was measured by evaluating the incorporation of labeled phosphate from [γ-32P]ATP into the synthetic peptide substrate Kemptide, as described in Ref. 5.Naro F. Sette C. Vicini E. De Arcangelis V. Grange M. Conti M. Lagarde M. Molinaro M. Adamo S. Nemoz G. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1999; 10: 4355-4367Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar. cAMP-Phosphodiesterase Activity—cAMP-phosphodiesterase activity was assayed by a two-step radioisotopic procedure, based on the transformation of labeled 5′-AMP produced by phosphodiesterase action on [3H]cyclic AMP into adenosine by treatment with 5′-nucleotidase and separation of labeled substrate and adenosine end product by anion exchange column chromatography, as described in Ref. 5.Naro F. Sette C. Vicini E. De Arcangelis V. Grange M. Conti M. Lagarde M. Molinaro M. Adamo S. Nemoz G. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1999; 10: 4355-4367Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar. Western Blot Analysis—Cells cultured in 1% BSA medium for 24 h were treated with AVP for different times, washed, and directly extracted in Laemmli buffer. The extracts were probe-sonicated for 2 s. 20 μg of protein extracts were analyzed by SDS-PAGE. Immunodetection was performed with a polyclonal anti-phospho-CREB antibody (New England Biolabs) diluted 1:1000. Second antibody incubation was carried out with 1:10,000 dilution of anti-rabbit-IgG antibody conjugated to horseradish peroxidase. Immunostained bands were detected by the ECL method (Amersham Biosciences). AVP Induces a Transient Increase in cAMP Levels—Because intracellular cAMP concentration plays a crucial role for myogenic differentiation, we set out to investigate in detail the modulation of cAMP levels by AVP, a strong inducer of differentiation in L6-C5 cells. We found that AVP stimulation of L6-C5 cells provoked a transient increase in the intracellular cAMP concentration, with a peak reached after 1-3 min and a return to basal levels after ∼15 min (Fig. 1A). The maximal AVP-induced cAMP accumulation measured in the presence of the nonselective phosphodiesterase inhibitor IBMX was about 10-20-fold the basal level, much lower than that induced by epinephrin in the same conditions (almost 1000-fold basal level; Fig. 1B). AVP elicited a concentration-dependent increase of cAMP levels, with an EC50 of 0.3 nm (Fig. 1C), a concentration within the range of the physiological concentrations of the hormone in the bloodstream. Type 4 Phosphodiesterase Activity Is Involved in the Limitation of Amplitude and Duration of the Early cAMP Response to AVP—We have previously shown that AVP triggers a biphasic activation of type 4 cAMP-specific phosphodiesterase, with an initial peak after 2 min and a later one after 15 min of hormonal treatment (5.Naro F. Sette C. Vicini E. De Arcangelis V. Grange M. Conti M. Lagarde M. Molinaro M. Adamo S. Nemoz G. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1999; 10: 4355-4367Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). To determine whether the transient nature of the cAMP rise triggered by AVP was due to the activity of this phosphodiesterase family, cAMP levels were measured in L6-C5 cells stimulated by AVP in the presence or absence of rolipram, a selective PDE4 inhibitor. Interestingly, we observed that rolipram strongly potentiated the increase in cAMP concentration caused by AVP treatment and allowed the maintenance of elevated cAMP levels for at least 30 min (Fig. 1D). This result indicates that PDE4 activity is required for the rapid return of cAMP to basal levels observed in L6-C5 cells and suggests that AVP controls the level and duration of the cAMP transient by concomitantly stimulating cAMP production and degradation by PDE4 in these cells. The AVP-induced cAMP Accumulation Is Mediated by V1a Receptor Stimulation—It has been suggested, on the basis of functional observations, that L6 myoblasts do not express the adenylyl cyclase-coupled V2 receptors for AVP. On the other hand, these cells express V1 receptors, which are connected to the phospholipase C signaling pathway (16.Wakelam M.J.O. Patterson S. Hanley M.R. FEBS Lett. 1987; 210: 181-184Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar). We set out to determine whether low levels of the V2 receptor, which could account for the cAMP response to AVP, are expressed by L6-C5 cells. We thus performed reverse transcriptase-PCR experiments using primers designed to amplify specific regions of the V1a and V2 receptor cDNAs. As shown in Fig. 2A, V1a receptor mRNA transcripts are present in both L6-C5 myoblasts and differentiated myotubes. However, we failed to detect even trace amounts of V2 receptor mRNA (Fig. 2A), indicating that AVP does not act through this adenylyl cyclase-coupled receptor in L6-C5 cells. To test whether the V1 receptor was involved in cAMP generation triggered by AVP, L6-C5 cells were stimulated in the presence of an excess of the selective V1 receptor antagonist [deamino-Pen1,O-Me-Tyr2, Arg8]-vasopressin and cAMP accumulation was measured. We observed that the V1 receptor antagonist completely suppressed the rise in intracellular cAMP concentration induced by AVP in L6-C5 cells (Fig. 1C), indicating that the hormone action requires stimulation of V1 receptors. To ascertain whether activation of V1a receptors is sufficient to mediate the AVP-induced cAMP rise, we transiently transfected COS-1 cells, which do not respond to AVP, with an expression plasmid carrying the V1a receptor cDNA, and we evaluated the cAMP response of transfected cells. As expected, AVP stimulation did not exert any effect on cAMP levels in mock transfected cells. By contrast, transfection of V1a receptor was sufficient to confer to COS cells the ability to respond to AVP, a 70% increase in intracellular cAMP levels being observed after hormonal stimulation (Fig. 2B). The mechanism of cAMP Synthesis Activation Induced by AVP in L6 Cells Involves Prostaglandin Synthesis and Secretion—Because V1a receptor is not coupled to adenylyl cyclase, we hypothesized that the activation of cAMP synthesis was due to an indirect mechanism set in motion by AVP. It has been reported that AVP triggers phospholipase A2 activation and liberation of free arachidonic acid in H9c2 cardiac myoblasts (17.Chen W.C. Chen C.C. Endocrinology. 1999; 140: 1639-1648Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Considering that free arachidonate may be further metabolized into prostaglandins that are known activators of cAMP synthesis, we tested the existence of such a pathway in L6-C5 cells. We first determined whether AVP was able to trigger the synthesis of prostaglandins in these cells. L6-C5 myoblasts were labeled by preincubation with [14C]arachidonic acid before the stimulation with the hormone. We observed that a 5-min AVP treatment lead to a 2-fold increase in the total radioactivity released in the culture medium (not shown), indicative of phospholipase A2 stimulation. TLC analysis of lipid extracts of the culture medium (Fig. 3A) showed that AVP promoted the synthesis and release of prostaglandins E2 and D2 principally, and PGF2α in smaller amount, suggesting that these compounds could act as autocrine effectors to activate adenylyl cyclase. To examine this hypothesis, we measured cAMP accumulation in response to AVP in the presence of two different cyclooxygenase inhibitors able to block the conversion of endogenous arachidonate into prostaglandins. Indeed, the cAMP increase induced by AVP was completely suppressed by indomethacin and partially by aspirin (Fig. 3B), confirming that prostaglandin synthesis was required for the production of cAMP. AVP Induces a Rapid Activation of the cAMP Signaling Pathway—To assess whether, despite its transient feature, the AVP-induced cAMP elevation has a functional significance, we investigated the consequences of AVP treatment on the downstream steps of the cAMP pathway of signaling. We found that PKA was activated 2.3-fold in L6 cells treated for 5 min with AVP and that PKA activity returned to basal levels in 30-45 min (Fig. 4A). Furthermore, as shown in Fig. 4B, AVP stimulation resulted in the phosphorylation of the CREB transcription factor, the PKA phosphorylation of which represents a critical step in the transcriptional regulation of gene expression by the cAMP pathway (18.Sassone-Corsi P. Int. J. Biochem. Cell Biol. 1998; 30: 27-38Crossref PubMed Scopus (206) Google Scholar). CREB was rapidly phosphorylated in response to AVP, with a steady-state phosphorylation reached in 15-30 min (Fig. 4B, upper panel). In the presence of the PKA inhibitor H89, AVP-induced CREB phosphorylation was totally suppressed (Fig. 4B, lower panel), suggesting that it was mediated by activated PKA. The time course of PKA activation by AVP (Fig. 4A) indicates that its maximal activity is reached before the second phase of PDE4 activation, which peaks at 15-30 min (5.Naro F. Sette C. Vicini E. De Arcangelis V. Grange M. Conti M. Lagarde M. Molinaro M. Adamo S. Nemoz G. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1999; 10: 4355-4367Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). Because the major type 4 phosphodiesterase isoform expressed in L6 cells is PDE4D3, which can be activated by PKA-mediated phosphorylation (15.Sette C. Conti M. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 16526-16534Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (356) Google Scholar), it is possible that the late phase of PDE stimulation depends on PKA. Thus, we tested the effects of PKA inhibition on the biphasic activation of PDE by AVP. As shown in Fig. 5, only the late activation of PDE (15 min) was dependent on PKA activity, whereas the early activation (3 min) was not affected in the presence of the PKA inhibitor H89. This result indicates that PKA is involved in the second phase of AVP-dependent PDE stimulation. The Transient Activation of the cAMP Pathway Induced by AVP Positively Influences Myogenic Differentiation—To evaluate whether the early activation of the cAMP pathway is required for L6-C5 cell myogenic differentiation triggered by AVP, we added H89 at different times before or after the onset of AVP treatment. When PKA activity was blocked before the AVP treatment, it resulted in a marked decrease in the number and the size of myotubes formed after 6 days in response to AVP (Fig. 6A). This effect was confirmed by measuring creatine kinase activity, a marker of terminal differentiation (Fig. 6B). H89 added before the onset of AVP stimulation significantly decreased creatine kinase expression (by 65% when added 90 min before AVP), which suggests that early PKA-mediated events have a positive influence on myogenic differentiation. Interestingly, the H89 inhibition of creatine kinase expression was not significant if the inhibitor was added 1-5 h after the onset of AVP treatment (Fig. 6B), demonstrating that a short-lived activation (within 1 h) of the cyclic AMP pathway is sufficient to stimulate myogenic differentiation. Furthermore, we observed that inhibition of PKA activity by H89 24 h after the onset of AVP treatment induced a significant stimulation of terminal differentiation, as evaluated by measuring after 6 days the activity of creatine kinase (+71% with H89 treatment) and the expression of myosin heavy chain (+96% with H89 treatment) (Fig. 6C). A Mutated Form of Phosphodiesterase PDE4D3 That Is Insensitive to PKA Phosphorylation Is Less Efficient at Enhancing AVP-induced Differentiation than Wild-type Enzyme—We have previously shown that overexpression of the PDE4D3 phosphodiesterase isoform is able to potentiate AVP-induced differentiation of L6-C5 cells and, in particular, to enhance the nuclear accumulation of myogenin, an early and crucial step of the myogenic process (5.Naro F. Sette C. Vicini E. De Arcangelis V. Grange M. Conti M. Lagarde M. Molinaro M. Adamo S. Nemoz G. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1999; 10: 4355-4367Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). Based on the results of Fig. 5 suggesting that AVP induces a PKA-mediated activation of phosphodiesterase, it is possible that PDE4D3 phosphorylation is involved in AVP differentiating effects. To test the requirement of PKA-mediated phosphorylation and activation of PDE4D3 for the onset of myogenic differentiation, we took advantage of a PDE4D3 point mutant, S54A-PDE4D3, which is insensitive to PKA activation (15.Sette C. Conti M. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 16526-16534Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (356) Google Scholar). L6-C5 cells were transfected with either wild-type or S54A-PDE4D3, stimulated with AVP, and monitored for nuclear translocation of myogenin. As shown in Fig. 7, the PKA-insensitive mutant, in contrast with the wild-type form, did not activate the basal level of differentiation, nor did it enhance the effect of AVP, suggesting that PKA-dependent phosphorylation of PDE4D3 has an important role in the AVP-induced myogenic response. We have previously established that the neuropituitary hormone AVP is able to strongly stimulate the in vitro myogenic differentiation of L6 myoblasts, as well as of other myogenic cell lines and primary cells. AVP myogenic effects involve the sustained activation of a type 4 phosphodiesterase and a prolonged decrease in both cAMP levels and PKA activity, occurring after a few hours of AVP treatment. In the present study, we examined the modifications of the cAMP pathway induced by AVP in L6 ce"
https://openalex.org/W2141732586,"The kinetics of slow onset inhibition of Proteinase K by a proteinaceous alkaline protease inhibitor (API) from a Streptomyces sp. is presented. The kinetic analysis revealed competitive inhibition of Proteinase K by API with an IC50 value 5.5 ± 0.5 × 10–5m. The progress curves were time-dependent, consistent with a two-step slow tight binding inhibition. The first step involved a rapid equilibrium for formation of reversible enzyme-inhibitor complex (EI) with a Ki value 5.2 ± 0.6 × 10–6m. The EI complex isomerized to a stable complex (EI*) in the second step because of inhibitor-induced conformational changes, with a rate constant k5 (9.2 ± 1 × 10–3 s–1). The rate of dissociation of EI* (k6) was slower (4.5 ± 0.5 × 10–5 s–1) indicating the tight binding nature of the inhibitor. The overall inhibition constant Ki* for two-step inhibition of Proteinase K by API was 2.5 ± 0.3 × 10–7m. Time-dependent dissociation of EI* revealed that the complex failed to dissociate after a time point and formed a conformationally altered, irreversible complex EI**.

An effervescence of research efforts has been expended in the design and synthesis of inhibitors of proteolytic enzymes not only to understand the active site structure and mechanism of these enzymes but also to help generate new therapeutic agents. Specific inhibitors of proteases have proved valuable in a number of applications ranging from mechanistic studies to possible therapeutic uses. Protein inhibitors of proteases are ubiquitously present in plants, animals, and microorganisms (1.Birk Y. Neuberger A. Brocklehurst K. Proteinase Inhibitors, Hydrolytic Enzymes. Elsevier Science Publishers B. V., Amsterdam1987: 257-305Google Scholar). Fundamentally, proteinaceous inhibitors should serve as substrates for proteolysis rather than being their inhibitors. Elucidation of this paradox is the basis for the extensive research on the structure-function relationship of proteinaceous inhibitors of proteases. The importance of proteolytic processes in the regulation of post-translational processing of precursor proteins and the involvement of proteases in intracellular protein metabolism and in various pathological processes have recently stimulated tremendous interest in studying the kinetic properties of naturally occurring target-oriented protease inhibitors. Serine proteases are divided in trypsin-like and subtilisin-like families, which have been independently evolved with a similar catalytic mechanism (2.Blow D.M. Acc. Chem. Res. 1976; 9: 142-145Crossref Scopus (482) Google Scholar, 3.Tsukuda H. Blow D. J. Mol. Biol. 1985; 184: 703-711Crossref PubMed Scopus (267) Google Scholar, 4.Bone R. Shenvi A.B. Kettner C.

The functional importance of the catalytic triad and oxyanion hole in catalysis of serine proteases has been clearly established (7.Russel A.J. Fersht A.R. Nature. 1987; 328: 496-500Crossref PubMed Scopus (301) Google Scholar, 8.Carter P. Wells J.A. Nature. 1988; 332: 564-568Crossref PubMed Scopus (530) Google Scholar). Proteinase K, the serine protease from the subtilisin family is a highly active extracellular alkaline serine endopeptidase from Tritirachium album limber and named Proteinase K because of its ability to digest native keratin (9.Ebeling W. Hennrich N. Klockow M. Metz H. Orth H.U. Lang H. Eur. J. Biochem. 1974; 47: 91-97Crossref PubMed Scopus (483) Google Scholar, 10.Betzel C. Pal G.P. Saenger W. Eur. J. Biochem. 1988; 178: 155-171Crossref PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar). By virtue of its unusual stability at low concentrations of SDS and urea, Proteinase K has immense applications in basic and applied research. X-ray crystallographic studies have revealed that the catalytic triad of Proteinase K is formed by the residues His-69, Asp-39, Ser-224, and a single free Cys-73 residue is located below the functional His-69 (11.Betzel C. Gourinath S. Kumar P. Kaur P. Perbandt M. Eschenburg S. Singh T.P. Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 3080-3088Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar). During catalysis Ser-224 functions as the primary nucleophile and His-69 plays a dual role as proton acceptor and donor at different steps in the reaction. The Asp-39 residue is known to participate in a complex hydrogen bond network with His-69, thus bringing the His-69 residue in the correct orientation to facilitate nucleophilic attack by Ser-224. Determination of the mechanism of inhibition of this protease will provide better insights in understanding the mechanism of inhibition and will shed light on the protein-protein interactions at the molecular level. Serine proteases and their protein inhibitors have been the most intensively studied group of protein-protein complexes. An enormous number of known and partially characterized inhibitors of serine proteases from plants, animals, and microorganisms have been documented and have been grouped in different families (1.Birk Y. Neuberger A. Brocklehurst K. Proteinase Inhibitors, Hydrolytic Enzymes. Elsevier Science Publishers B. V., Amsterdam1987: 257-305Google Scholar, 12.Rao M. Tanksale A.M. Ghatge M.S. Deshpande V.V. Microbiol. Mol. Biol. Rev. 1998; 62: 597-635Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Among the proteinaceous inhibitors from microorganisms, the well characterized inhibitors are from Streptomyces (13.Taguchi S. Kojima S. Kumagai I. Ogawara H. Miura K. Momose H. FEMS Microbiol. Lett. 1992; 99: 293-297Crossref Scopus (29) Google Scholar) and belong to the family Streptomyces subtilisin inhibitor (SSI). 1The abbreviations used are: SSIStreptomyces subtilisin inhibitorAPIalkaline protease inhibitorsAAPFN-succinyl-l-Ala-Ala-Pro-Phe5-IAF5-iodoacetamidofluoresceinEIreversible enzyme-inhibitor complexEI*isomer of the second enzyme-inhibitor complexEI**irreversible enzyme-inhibitor complexHPLChigh pressure liquid chromatography.1The abbreviations used are: SSIStreptomyces subtilisin inhibitorAPIalkaline protease inhibitorsAAPFN-succinyl-l-Ala-Ala-Pro-Phe5-IAF5-iodoacetamidofluoresceinEIreversible enzyme-inhibitor complexEI*isomer of the second enzyme-inhibitor complexEI**irreversible enzyme-inhibitor complexHPLChigh pressure liquid chromatography. The future development of these inhibitors for their potential application in therapeutics and biocontrol agents will undoubtedly depend on application of kinetic techniques that yield quantitative information about the behavior of the inhibitors. When the structure of inhibitor can be correlated with the true dissociation constants for their enzyme-inhibitor complexes, a systematic approach can be made toward the design of more effective inhibitors for a target enzyme using protein engineering. Delineating the inhibition mechanism and role of the reactive site residues of the inhibitors and understanding the binding efficiency will provide further insight for their potential application. Considering the physiological importance of the serine alkaline proteases and their role in various physiological and biotechnological processes, there is a lacuna in the studies on the kinetics of the mechanism of inhibition by their naturally occurring protein inhibitors.

The protein has been purified to homogeneity by ammonium sulfate precipitation, preparative polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, and anion exchange chromatography. The biochemical characterization has revealed that API is a dimeric protein (Mr 28,000) with five disulfide linkages. Chemical modification studies of API and its binding interaction with the alkaline protease from Conidiobolus sp. have revealed the presence of a tryptophan residue in the reactive site and a disulfide bond at or near the reactive site of the inhibitor (15.Vernekar J. Tanksale A. Ghatge M. Deshpande V. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2001; 285: 1018-1024Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar). The biochemical and secondary structural analysis of the inhibitor have revealed that the API belongs to the SSI family of inhibitors. Inhibitors belonging to the SSI family follow the standard mechanism of inhibition wherein the inhibitor acts as a highly specific substrate for limited proteolysis by the target enzyme (16.Laskowaski Jr., M. Kato I. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1980; 49: 593-626Crossref PubMed Scopus (1936) Google Scholar). These inhibitors bind very tightly to enzyme in the manner of a good substrate and are cleaved very slowly. We present the first report of a proteinaceous API exhibiting slow tight binding inhibition against Proteinase K. The steady-state kinetics revealed a two-step inhibition mechanism and the conformational modes observed during the binding of inhibitor to the enzyme were conveniently monitored by fluorescence analysis. The mechanism of inactivation of Proteinase K by API was delineated and the kinetic parameters associated with the enzyme-inhibitor interaction were determined. The role of hydrogen bonding interactions in the inhibition mechanism of Proteinase K was deciphered by investigating the fluorescence of the 5-iodoacetamidofluorescein (IAF)-labeled enzyme and a model for the mechanism of interactions has been proposed. Materials—Purified Proteinase K from T. album limber, 5-iodoacetamidofluorescein, and sAAPF-p-nitroanilide were obtained from Sigma. All other chemicals used were of analytical grade. Microorganism, Growth Conditions, and Purification of API—The Streptomyces sp. was grown in liquid casein-starch medium for 96 h at 28 °C on a rotary shaker at 200 rpm. The cells were separated by centrifugation and the cell-free supernatant was checked for the presence of API. API was purified from the Streptomyces sp. as reported (14.Vernekar J. Ghatge M. Deshpande V. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1999; 262: 702-707Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). Briefly, the extracellular culture filtrate containing API was concentrated by ultrafiltration and purified by polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis using the gel x-ray film contact print technique. In the gel x-ray film contact print technique, after electrophoretic resolution of the protein, a vertical strip of the gel was cut and incubated for 10 min in 0.1 m carbonate-bicarbonate buffer, pH 10.0, containing 0.5 mg/ml of the bacterial alkaline protease, subtilisin. The gel was overlaid on an equal sized x-ray film and the hydrolysis of gelatin was followed for 20 min at 37 °C. The band corresponding to the inhibitory activity was excised and eluted by homogenization followed by vacuum filtration and purified further by DEAE-cellulose chromatography. Proteinase K Assay and Inhibition Kinetics—Proteolytic activity of Proteinase K was measured by assaying the enzyme activity using casein and the synthetic substrate sAAPF-p-nitroanilide. Proteinase K (100 nm) was dissolved in 0.05 mTris-HCl buffer, pH 8.5, containing 1 mm CaCl2. The reaction was initiated by the addition of 1 ml of casein (5 mg/ml) at 37 °C for 30 min. The reaction was quenched by the addition of 2 ml of 5% acidified trichloroacetic acid followed by incubating for 30 min at room temperature. The unhydrolyzed casein precipitate was separated by centrifugation and filtration through Whatman No. 1 filter paper. Absorbance of the trichloroacetic acid-soluble products was measured at 280 nm. The enzymatic activity in the presence of the synthetic substrate is determined as described (17.DelMar E.G. Largmann C. Brodrick J.W. Geokas M.C. Anal. Biochem. 1979; 99: 316-320Crossref PubMed Scopus (541) Google Scholar). One unit of protease activity was defined as the amount of enzyme that causes an increase of 1 absorbance unit at 280 nm for alkaline proteases. One protease inhibitor unit was defined as the amount of inhibitor that inhibits 1 unit of protease activity. For initial kinetic analysis, the kinetic parameters for the substrate hydrolysis were determined by measuring the initial rate of enzymatic activity. The inhibition constant (Ki) was determined by Dixon (18.Dixon M. Biochem. J. 1953; 55: 170-171Crossref PubMed Scopus (3280) Google Scholar) and using the Lineweaver-Burk method. The Km value was also calculated from the double-reciprocal equation by fitting the data into Microcal Origin. For the Lineweaver-Burk analysis, Proteinase K (1 μm) was incubated with API at 1 and 2.5 μm and assayed at increasing concentrations of casein (1–10 mg/ml). In the method of Dixon (18.Dixon M. Biochem. J. 1953; 55: 170-171Crossref PubMed Scopus (3280) Google Scholar), proteolytic activity of Proteinase K (1 μm) was measured in the presence of 5 and 10 mg/ml of casein, at concentrations of API ranging from 1 to 5 μm at 37 °C for 30 min. The reciprocals of substrate hydrolysis (1/v) were plotted against the inhibitor concentration and the Ki was determined by fitting the data using Microcal Origin. For progress curve analysis, assays were carried out in a 1-ml reaction mixture containing enzyme, substrate, and inhibitor at various concentrations. The reaction mixture contained Proteinase K (100 nm) in the required buffer and varying concentrations of API and casein (5 mg/ml). Reaction was initiated by the addition of Proteinase K at 37 °C and the release of products was monitored at different time intervals at 280 nm. In each slow binding inhibition experiment, five to six assays were performed with appropriate blanks. For the kinetic analysis and rate constant determinations, the assays were carried out in triplicate and the average value was considered throughout. Further details of the experiments are given in the respective figure legends. Evaluation of Kinetic Parameters—Initial rate studies for reversible, competitive inhibition were analyzed as per Equation 1.v=VmaxSKm(1+I/Ki)+S(Eq. 1) Where Km is the Michaelis constant, Vmax is the maximal catalytic rate at saturating substrate concentration [S], Ki = (k4/k3) is the dissociation constant for the first reversible enzyme-inhibitor complex, and I is the inhibitor concentration (19.Cleland W.W. Methods Enzymol. 1979; 63: 103-138Crossref PubMed Scopus (1929) Google Scholar). The progress curves for the interactions between API and Proteinase K were analyzed using Equation 2 (20.Beith J.G. Methods Enzymol. 1995; 248: 59-84Crossref PubMed Scopus (186) Google Scholar, 21.Morison J.F. Stone S.R. Comments Mol. Cell. Biophys. 1985; 2: 347-368Google Scholar).[P]=vst+v0-vsk(1-e-kt)(Eq. 2) Where [P] is the product concentration at any time t, v0 and vs are the initial and final steady-state rates, respectively, and k is the apparent first-order rate constant for the establishment of the final steady-state equilibrium. Corrections have been made for the reduction in the inhibitor concentration that occurs on formation of the enzyme inhibitor (EI) complex. This is because in the case of tight binding inhibition, the concentration of EI is not negligible in comparison to the inhibitor concentration and the free inhibitor concentration is not equal to the added concentration of the inhibitor. The corrections of the variation of the steady-state velocity with the inhibitor concentrations were made according to Equations 3 and 4 as described by Morrison and Walsh (22.Morisson J.F. Walsh C.T. Adv. Enzymol. Relat. Areas Mol. Biol. 1988; 61: 201-301PubMed Google Scholar).vs=k7SQ2(Km+S)(Eq. 3) Q=[(Ki'+It-Et)+4Ki'Et]1/2-(Ki'+It-Et)(Eq. 4) Where Ki′ = Ki* (1 + S/Km), k7 rate constant for the product formation, and It and Et stand for total inhibitor and enzyme concentrations, respectively. The relationship between the rate constant of enzymatic reaction k, and the kinetic constants for the association and dissociation of the enzyme and inhibitor was determined as per Equation 5.k=k6+k5[I/Ki1+(S/Km)+(I/Ki)](Eq. 5) The progress curves were analyzed by Equations 2 and 5 using non-linear least-square parameter minimization to determine the best-fit values with the corrections for the tight binding inhibition. The overall inhibition constant was determined as given by Equation 6.Ki*=[E][I][EI]+[EI*]=Ki[k6k5+k6](Eq. 6) For the time-dependent inhibition, there exists a time range in the progress curves wherein formation of EI* is small. Within this time range it is possible to measure the effect of the inhibitor on v0, i.e. to measure Ki directly. Values for Ki were obtained from Dixon analysis at a constant substrate concentration as described in Equation 7.1v=1Vmax+KmVmaxS(1+I/Ki)(Eq. 7) The rate constant k6, for the dissociation of the second enzyme-inhibitor complex was measured directly from the time-dependent inhibition. Concentrated Proteinase K and API were incubated in a reaction mixture to reach equilibrium, followed by large dilutions in assay mixtures containing near saturating substrate. Proteinase K (1 mm) was preincubated with API (500 μm) for 30 min in 0.05 m sodium phosphate buffer, pH 7.5. 5 μl of the preincubated sample was removed and diluted 5000-fold in the same buffer and assayed at 50 °C using casein (150 mg/ml) at different time intervals. Gel Filtration Analysis of the Enzyme-Inhibitor Complexes—The quaternary structure of the enzyme-inhibitor complexes was monitored by size exclusion chromatography on a Protein-Pak 300SW HPLC column (7.8 × 300 mm) using a Waters liquid chromatograph system. The column was equilibrated with 0.05 m potassium phosphate buffer, pH 7.5, before the analysis. For the formation of enzyme-inhibitor complex Proteinase K (1 mm) was preincubated with API (500 μm) in 0.05 m sodium phosphate buffer, pH 7.5. 5 μl of the preincubated sample was removed at 30 and after 60 min and loaded on the system to analyze the conformational changes in the enzyme-inhibitor complex. The elution of the complexes was monitored by absorption at 280 nm. Fluorescence Analysis—Fluorescence measurements were performed on a PerkinElmer LS50 luminescence spectrometer. Tryptophanyl fluorescence was excited at 295 nm and emission was recorded from 300 to 500 nm at 25 °C. The slit widths on both the excitation and emission were set at 5 nm and the spectra were obtained at 50 nm/min. For inhibitor binding studies, Proteinase K (1 μm) was dissolved in 0.05 m sodium phosphate buffer, pH 7.5. Titration of the enzyme with API was performed by adding different concentrations of the inhibitor to a fixed concentration of enzyme solution. For each inhibitor concentration on the titration curve a new enzyme solution was used. All the data on the titration curve were corrected for dilutions and the graphs were smoothened. The magnitude of the rapid fluorescence decrease (F0 – F) occurring at each API concentration was computer fitted to Equation 8, to determine the calculated value of Ki and ΔFmax (23.Houtzager V. Oullet M. Falgueyret J.-P. Passmore L.A. Bayly C. Percival M.D. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 10974-10984Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar).(F0-F)=ΔFmax/{1+(Ki/[I])}(Eq. 8) The first-order rate constants kobs at each inhibitor concentration [I] were fitted to Equation 9 for the determination of k5 under the assumption that for a tight binding inhibitor k6 can be considered negligible at the onset of the slow loss of fluorescence.kobs=k5[I]/{Ki+[I]}(Eq. 9) Time course of protein fluorescence following the addition of inhibitor were measured for 10 min with excitation and emission wavelengths fixed at 295 and 335 nm, respectively, with data acquisition at 0.1-s intervals. Corrections for the inner filter effect were performed as described by Equation 10 (24.Lakowicz J.R. Principles of Fluorescence Spectroscopy. Plenum Press, New York1983: 180-195Google Scholar).Fc=Fantilog[(Aex+Aem)/2](Eq. 10) Where Fc and F stand for the corrected and measured fluorescence intensities, respectively, and Aex and Aem are the absorbence of the solution at the excitation and emission wavelengths, respectively. Background fluorescence from API and buffer were appropriately correct. Fluorescent Chemoaffinity Labeling of Proteinase K and the Effect of API Binding on the 5-IAF Fluorescence—Proteinase K (1 mm) was modified by treatment with 100-fold molar excess of 5-IAF in 50 mm potassium phosphate buffer, pH 7.5, for 24 h in the dark. At pH 7.5, 5-IAF specifically reacts with free –SH groups. The labeled protein was purified through Sephadex G-10 and eluted with phosphate buffer. Fractions showing absorbance at 280 and 490 nm were pooled and concentrated by lyophilization. The fluorescence spectrum of 5-IAF-labeled Proteinase K was monitored at an excitation wavelength of 490 nm and emission wavelength from 490 to 600 nm. The number of Cys residues labeled was determined by using the molar absorptivity for 5-IAF of 80,000 cm–1m–1. The stoichiometry of the fluorescence labeling was determined to be 1:1 between 5-IAF and Proteinase K. Kinetic Analysis of the Inhibition of Proteinase K by API— The API was produced extracellularly by a Streptomyces sp., and has been characterized for its inhibitory activity toward the alkaline proteases (14.Vernekar J. Ghatge M. Deshpande V. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1999; 262: 702-707Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). Initial inhibition kinetic assessments revealed that API is a competitive inhibitor of Proteinase K with an IC50 (concentration of the inhibitor required for 50% inhibition of the enzyme) value of 5.5 ± 0.5 × 10–5m (Fig. 1). The steady-state rate of proteolytic activity of Proteinase K was reached rapidly in the absence of API, whereas, in its presence a time-dependent decrease in the rate as a function of the inhibitor concentration was observed. The progress curves in the presence of API revealed a time range where the initial rate of reaction was similar to that in the absence of the inhibitor, and does not deviate from linearity (Fig. 2), therefore conversion of EI to EI* was minimal. This time range for a low concentration of API was 8 min for Proteinase K, wherein all the classical competitive inhibition experiments were used to determine the Ki (k4/k3) value (Equation 5). The inhibition constant Ki associated with the formation of the reversible EI determined from the reciprocal equation was 5.2 ± 0.6 × 10–6m, which was further corroborated by the Dixon method (Fig. 3). The apparent rate constant k, derived from the progress curves of Proteinase K when plotted versus the inhibitor concentration followed a biphasic hyperbolic function (Fig. 4), revealing that fast equilibrium precedes the formation of the final slow dissociating enzyme-inhibitor complex (EI*), indicating a two-step, slow tight inhibition mechanism. Indeed the data could be analyzed with Equation 5 by non-linear regression analysis to obtain the best estimate of the overall inhibition constant Ki* (2.5 ± 0.3 × 10–7m). In the case of slow tight binding inhibitors, because the EI* complex is stable and dissociates slowly, the rate constant k6, for the conversion of EI* to EI was determined in an alternative method, by pre-incubating high concentrations of enzyme and inhibitor for sufficient time to allow the system to reach equilibrium. Furthermore, large dilution of the enzyme-inhibitor complex into a relatively large volume of assay mixture containing saturating substrate concentrations causes dissociation of the enzyme-inhibitor complex and the dissociation constant can be determined by the regeneration of enzymatic activity. Under these conditions, v0 and the effective inhibitor concentration are considered approximately equal to zero and the rate of activity regeneration will provide the k6 value. The preincubated (30 min) mixture of Proteinase K and API was diluted 5,000-fold into the assay mixture containing the substrate at a saturating substrate concentration. By least-squares minimization of Equation 2 to the data for recovery of enzymatic activity, the determined k6 value was 4.5 ± 0.5 × 10–5 s–1 (Fig. 5), which clearly indicated a very slow dissociation of EI*. The final steady-state rate vs was determined from the control that was preincubated without the inhibitor. The value of the rate constant k5, associated with the isomerization of EI to EI*, was 9.2 ± 1 × 10–3 s–1 as obtained from fits of Equation 3 to the onset of inhibition data using the experimentally determined values of Ki and k6 (Table I). The overall inhibition constant Ki* is a function of k6/(k5 + k6) and is equal to the product of Ki and this function. The k6 value indicated a slower rate of dissociation of EI* and the half-life (t½) for the reactivation of EI* determined from the k6 value was 4.27 ± 0.5 h, suggesting higher binding affinity of API toward Proteinase K. When the incubation time was more than 60 min, the inhibitor failed to dissociate from the complex, because there was no recovery in the enzymatic activity (Fig. 5). This observation can be attributed to gross conformational changes in the EI* complex induced by leading toward the formation of a conformationally locked irreversible enzyme-inhibitor complex (EI**). To characterize the EI** we have carried out the quaternary structural analysis by gel filtration chromatography on a HPLC system. As revealed by Fig. 6A, the complex formed after 30 min of equilibration showed a retention time of 16 min, which demonstrated the formation of the EI* complex. However, when the equilibration time between the enzyme and inhibitor was more than 60 min (Fig. 6B), the retention time of the complex was shifted to 15 min indicating a change in the conformation of the EI*. This difference in the retention time can be attributed to the formation of irreversible complex EI** because of gross conformational changes induced in the EI* complex. These conformational states of the enzyme-inhibitor complex are further characterized by fluorescence spectroscopy. All our kinetic analysis for the slow tight binding inhibition has been determined in the time frame before the formation of the irreversible complex.Fi"

Coupling these potentials requires that the catalytic cycle include reaction stage-dependent conformational changes that gate the activities of the two active sites. These interactions were probed in a mutagenesis study of a highly conserved pyrophosphate-binding motif (SXGXDS), which is located at the APS-forming active site. The motif appears to be unique to the N-type PPi synthetase family, and mutations in it are linked, in other systems, to citrullinemia, an often fatal orphan disease. The conserved sites in the motif were evaluated individually for their ability to activate GTP hydrolysis (which reports interactions among the activator (AMP or Mg2+·PPi), the enzyme, and GTP), to affect the energetic coupling of the two reactions, and to alter the kinetic constants of the adenylyl transfer reaction in the absence of guanine nucleotide. What emerges from this first mutagenic exploration of the PPi motif in any adenylyltransferase is that the residues of the motif participate differently, and in sometimes profoundly important ways, in the different functions of the enzyme.

ATP sulfurylase, from Escherichia coli K-12, is a rare example of a GTPase-coupled system in which the conformational events usually involved in target interactions are used, instead, to link the Gibbs potential of GTP hydrolysis to another small molecule reaction, the synthesis of activated sulfate (adenosine 5′-phosphosulfate, or APS), 1The abbreviations used are: APSadenosine 5′-phosphosulfatePAPSadenosine 3′-phosphate 5′-phosphosulfateIPTGisopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranosideP-enolpyruvatephosphoenolpyruvate. as shown in Reactions 1 and 2 (1.Liu C.

The native enzyme is a tetramer of heterodimers, each of which is composed of a GTPase subunit (CysN, 53 kDa) and an adenylyltransferase subunit (CysD, 23 kDa) (3.Leyh T.S. Taylor J.C. Markham G.D.

ATP sulfurylase links these two chemistries with high efficiency (1:1 stoichiometry) and couples virtually all of the chemical potential available in the hydrolysis reaction to APS synthesis (1.Liu C. Suo Y. Leyh T.S. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 7309-7314Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). The phosphoric-sulfuric acid anhydride bond formed during the transfer reaction chemically activates the otherwise non-reactive sulfate for participation in its subsequent metabolic biochemistry: reduction and sulfuryl transfer. Activated sulfate is essential for sulfur redox metabolism in bacteria (5.Odom J.M. Singleton Jr., R. The Sulfate-Reducing Bacteria: Contemporary Perspectives. Springer-Verlag, New York1993: 1-19Google Scholar). Certain organisms, including E. coli, reduce sulfate to sulfide, which is needed for the biosynthesis of reduced sulfur metabolites. Others use this reduction to draw electrons from their electron transport chains, whereas their symbionts oxidize reduced sulfur to provide electrons to these chains. Mammals use activated sulfate for an entirely different purpose, sulfuryl transfer. This reaction is used widely by the cell to regulate important metabolic processes including steroid and peptide hormone action (6.Falany C.N. Wheeler J. Oh T.S. Falany J.L. J. Steroid Biochem. Mol.

Glycobiology. 1993; 3: 83-88Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). As ATP sulfurylase moves through the various stages of its catalytic cycle, the ground and transition state energetics of the GTPase activity are modulated by inorganic pyrophosphate in ways that depend upon the role that PPi is asked to play. When it is the sole activator of GTP hydrolysis, PPi stimulates GTPase turnover 20-fold over the basal or non-activated level (0.010 s–1 (17.Wang R. Liu C. Leyh T.S. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 490-495Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar)), and the interaction energies that accelerate catalysis occur predominantly downstream of the partially rate-limiting isomerization that precedes scission of the β,γ-bond (18.Wei J. Leyh T.S. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 17163-17169Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar, 19.Wei J. Leyh T.S. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 6311-6316Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar, 20.Yang M.

When acting in concert with AMP to activate hydrolysis, PPi shifts the system 60-fold further toward the isomerized/hydrolytic form, and its release contributes to a resetting of the enzyme to its non-isomerized state. Identifying how and where the reaction coordinate is influenced by the changing contacts between PPi and the enzyme is fundamental to understanding how the catalytic cycles are coupled and how catalysis is accomplished in this system. The PPi motif, a highly conserved sequence that appears unique to N-type adenylyl transferases (22.Bork P. Koonin E.V. Proteins. 1994; 20: 347-355Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar), is N-terminally located in the primary sequence of ATP sulfurylase. The motif is defined by a hydrophobic β-strand and α-helix flanking the N- and C-terminal sides of a glycine-rich consensus sequence, SXGXDS, a pattern reminiscent of the Walker A motif (23.Walker J.E. Saraste M. Runswick M.J. Gay N.J. EMBO J. 1982; 1: 945-951Crossref PubMed Scopus (4269) Google Scholar, 24.Saraste M. Sibbald P.R. Wittinghofer A. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1990; 15: 430-434Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1756) Google Scholar). The structures of five N-type adenylyltransferases reveal that the architecture of the PPi motif and its extensive interactions with Mg2+·PPi are remarkably well conserved (see “Results and Discussion”). The functions of each of the conserved residues of the motif in adenylyl transfer and allosteric interactions between the APS-forming and GTPase active sites were explored in the current investigation through subtle mutagenic alterations that revealed that the roles of the residues change with the catalytic demands placed upon them. Platinum Pfx DNA polymerase and nucleotide mix were from Invitrogen. BamHI and XbaI restriction enzymes, lactate dehydrogenase (rabbit muscle), glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (yeast), pyruvate kinase (rabbit muscle), hexokinase (yeast), pyrophosphatase (yeast), β-NADH, phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and pepstatin were from Roche Diagnostics. T4 DNA ligase was from Promega. GTP, AMP, β-NADP, P-enolpyruvate, lysozyme, and streptomycin sulfate were from Sigma. Sodium ampicillin, sodium sulfate, potassium chloride, and Luria-Bertani Miller medium and agar were purchased from Fisher. Ammonium sulfate was purchased from ICN Biomedicals, Inc. Glucose was purchased from Mallinckrodt. IPTG was purchased from Labscientific, Inc. Q-Sepharose fast flow ion exchange and Sephacryl-300 size exclusion resins were purchased from Amersham Biosciences. Competent E. coli DH5α cells were from Invitrogen, and competent E. coli BL21(DE3) cells were from EMD Biosciences, Inc. Native ATP sulfurylase was purified according to previously published protocols (3.Leyh T.S. Taylor J.C. Markham G.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 2409-2416Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Briefly, the plasmid was transformed into BL21(DE3) cells using standard heat-shock methods and plated on LB-ampicillin plates. Colonies were selected and grown in LB-ampicillin medium at 37 °C with shaking, and IPTG was added to log-phase cells (A550 of ∼0.6) to a final concentration of 0.7 mm. The cells were spun down 3 h after the addition of IPTG, treated with lysozyme, and disrupted by sonication. The soluble fraction of the cell extract was treated with streptomycin sulfate, and the soluble fraction of the streptomycin sulfate-treated cells was treated with ammonium sulfate. The protein that precipitated at 30% ammonium sulfate was diluted, loaded onto a Fast-Q anion exchange column, and eluted using a 0.2-0.7 m KCl gradient in Hepes/K+ (25 mm, pH 8.0). The ATP sulfurylase fractions were pooled and run over an S300 size exclusion column in Hepes/K+ (50 mm, pH 8.0). The ATP sulfurylase fractions were pooled, concentrated, and stored at –70 °C. The purification of the mutant ATP sulfurylase was identical to that of the native form in all respects, except for the IPTG induction stage. The cells, after reaching an optical density of about 0.5, were cooled to 17 °C before the addition of IPTG. The cells were harvested by centrifugation and spun down 12 h after the IPTG addition. All subsequent steps were identical to those of the purification of the native ATP sulfurylase. APS kinase was purified according to previously published protocols (25.Wei J. Tang Q.X. Varlamova O. Roche C. Lee R. Leyh T.S. Biochemistry. 2002; 41: 8493-8498Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). Plasmids encoding the alanine mutation were constructed by standard PCR mutagenesis. Briefly, a region of the plasmid containing the site of point mutation and flanking BamHI and XbaI restriction sites was generated by PCR amplification and then substituted for the native sequence by restriction enzyme digestion and ligation. The PCR involved two rounds of amplification. In the first round, the plasmid encoding the native form of the enzyme was the PCR template. The left half of the insert (containing the XbaI site and the site of mutation) and the right half of the insert (containing the BamHI site and the site of mutation) were separately amplified using the Pfx polymerase. These two PCR products were purified by agarose gel electrophoresis to remove the native plasmid and then used in a second round of PCR. In this second round, the two PCR products were mixed (without the native plasmid) and amplified using the flanking primers encoding the BamHI and XbaI restriction sites to generate the full-length mutant insert. This insert was purified by agarose gel electrophoresis and digested with BamHI and XbaI. The digested insert was purified by agarose gel electrophoresis and ligated into the digested and purified sub-plasmid. The full coding sequence of the amplified region of the plasmid was verified. AMP- and PPi-activated GTP hydrolysis was monitored at 339 nm by coupling the production of GDP to the oxidation of NADH with the coupling enzymes pyruvate kinase and lactate dehydrogenase. The reaction conditions were as follows: P-enolpyruvate (1 mm), NADH (0.20 mm), and MgCl2 ([GTP] + 1.0 mm for AMP activation, [GTP] + 0.7 mm for PPi activation), 50 mm HEPES/K+, pH 8.0. The coupling enzymes were chosen so that the coupling reactions achieved ∼98% of their steady-state levels in <15 s. The concentration of native or mutant ATP sulfurylase used was as follows. AMP activation study: native (0.41 μm), S40A (1.3 μm), D39A (0.12 μm), G37A (1.2 μm), S35A (0.33 μm); PPi activation study: native (0.40 μm), S40A (2.1 μm), D39A (4 μm), G37A (16 μm), S35A (0.99 μm). The ATP-forming reaction was monitored by following the UV change associated with the reduction of NADP+, which was coupled to the production of ATP using the coupling enzymes hexokinase and glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase. The reaction conditions were as follows: ATP sulfurylase (0.26 μm), APS and PPi (at the concentrations indicated), hexokinase (9.2 units/ml), glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (0.50 units/ml), glucose (10 mm), NADP+ (0.20 mm), KCl (10 mm), and MgCl2 (1.0 mm + [PPi]), Hepes/K+ (50 mm, pH 8.0), temperature = 25 °C. Velocities were measured at the 16 concentrations defined by a 4 × 4 matrix of substrate and activator concentrations. The data were fit with the non-linear least-squares algorithm developed by Cleland (33.Cleland W.W. Methods Enzymol. 1979; 63: 103-138Crossref PubMed Scopus (1929) Google Scholar) using the model for a sequential binding mechanism (SEQUEN). Energy coupling assays were performed using the pyruvate kinase-lactate dehydrogenase system in a two-stage experiment. In the first stage, GTP hydrolysis was monitored as described above (GDP production is coupled to NADH oxidation). In the second stage, APS kinase is added, which couples the production of APS to the generation of ADP, the native substrate for pyruvate kinase. Thus, in this second stage, NADH oxidation is coupled to both GTP hydrolysis and APS formation. The reaction was initiated by the addition of ATP sulfurylase to a mix of pyrophosphatase (2.0 units/ml), pyruvate kinase (15 units/ml), lactate dehydrogenase (5.0 units/ml), Hepes/K+ (50 mm, pH 8.0), GTP (1.0 mm), P-enolpyruvate (1.0 mm), NADH (0.20 mm), and MgCl2 (1.0 mm + [ATP] + [GTP]), temperature = 25 °C. To ensure that ATP and sulfate were near saturating levels, measurements were made at 1.0 mm ATP and 1.0–5.0 mm sulfate in 1.0-mm increments and at 2.0, 3.0, 4.0, and 5.0 mm ATP with 5.0 mm sulfate. APS kinase activity in the assay was 0.4 units/ml. The reported efficiency is the highest efficiency measured from among the varying ATP and sulfate concentrations. A Model for the ATP Sulfurylase PPi Motif—The accuracy of any structural model for the ATP sulfurylase PPi motif depends upon the degree to which the ATP sulfurylase motif conforms to the consensus features of the PPi motif found in N-type adenylyl transferase for which structures are available. The Basic Local Alignment Search Tool, BLAST, retrieved E. coli CysH PAPS reductase as the protein with the greatest sequence similarity (24% sequence identity and 39% sequence homology) to E. coli CysD among all proteins with solved structures (Swiss Institute of Bioinformatics network). CysH contains the N-type PPi synthetase sequence motif found in CysD and other classes of enzymes that have PPi synthetase activity (e.g. GMP synthetases, NAD+ synthetases, asparagine synthetases, and argininosuccinate synthetases) (22.Bork P. Koonin E.V. Proteins. 1994; 20: 347-355Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar, 26.Nessi C. Albertini A.M. Speranza M.L. Galizzi A. J. Biol.

Structure (Camb.). 2001; 9: 1153-1164Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). Using CysH as the template, proteins containing the conserved PPi synthetase domain were selected with the Vector Alignment Search Tool algorithm, VAST (National Center for Biotechnology Information). This program compares the primary sequence and structural motifs of related proteins to identify regions of conserved three-dimensional structure. The sequences and conserved secondary structures (α-helix, β-sheet, PPi loop) of the best-matching proteins are shown in Fig. 1. Three different secondary structure prediction algorithms (PROF, University of Wales; Jpred, University of Dundee; and nnPredict, University of California) predicted that the secondary structural elements conserved in the known PPi synthetase domain are also found in the putative CysD PPi synthetase domain. The predictions were identical except for slight (single position) shifts of the boundaries that separate the three structural elements (α-helix, PPi-binding loop, and β-sheet). The predicted CysD secondary structure is shown. The nearly identical domain architecture shared by those enzymes with the highest degree of sequence homology to the CysD subunit is presented in Fig. 2A. The main chain α-carbons of GMP synthetase, NAD+ synthetase, and asparagine synthetase were aligned with GMP synthetase as the template, using Insight II (Accelrys Inc.). These three enzymes have absolute conservation of the SXGXDS motif found in CysD. The standard deviations between the Cα atoms of GMP synthetase and the two overlain enzymes were very small (0.38 and 0.57 Å for NAD+ synthetase and asparagine synthetase, respectively). This domain architecture is also highly conserved in argininosuccinate synthetase and adenosine 3′-phosphate,5′-phosphosulfate reductase (not shown), which do not have absolute conservation of the SXGXDS motif (see Table I). In an effort to identify the conserved contacts between PPi and its module, PPi from the GMP synthetase and from the active sites of all three proteins was overlain, as shown in Fig. 2B. The active site structures are nearly identical. Black lines show potential contacts between Mg2+·PPi and the most highly conserved residues in the PPi motif. The notable interactions are those between the side chains of the two serines and the β-phosphate, the main chain amide proton of the residue that occupies position 38 with the γ-phosphate, and the aspartate carboxyl group with the magnesium and γ-phosphate. The high similarity between the sequence and predicted structural features of the PPi domain of CysD and other pyrophosphate synthetases and the carefully preserved structure of this domain make it a compelling model for an important PPi binding aspect of the adenylyltransferase active site of the CysD subunit of ATP sulfurylase.Table IEffects of mutation on GTPase activation and coupling efficiencya The kinetic constant, and its standard error, are listed above the line; beneath it, the constant is normalized to that of the wild-type enzyme.b The ratio of the initial rates of GTP hydrolysis and ATP synthesis and its quotient are listed above the line; beneath it, the ratio is normalized to that of the wild-type enzyme. Open table in a new tab a The kinetic constant, and its standard error, are listed above the line; beneath it, the constant is normalized to that of the wild-type enzyme. b The ratio of the initial rates of GTP hydrolysis and ATP synthesis and its quotient are listed above the line; beneath it, the ratio is normalized to that of the wild-type enzyme. The Catalytic Integrity of the Sites—Changes in GTPase activation parameters caused by mutagenic substitution at a particular position indicate that the native residue at that position is part of a molecular framework either that undergoes structural change during allosteric communication or in which the substitution impinges in some way upon that framework, altering its behavior. Such alterations range from subtleties too small to observe crystallographically to gross structural changes that obliterate function. The AMP and PPi subsections of the APS-forming active site of ATP sulfurylase can be probed individually for their ability to bind ligand and communicate to the GTPase active site. A well functioning AMP-binding site, observed in all cases in this study (see below), demonstrates that a mutation in the PPi motif does not disrupt structure sufficiently to affect function at the contiguous AMP-binding subsection of the same active site. The Binding of AMP—Pyrophosphate synthetase structures in which the α,β-bond of ATP is cleaved show that direct interactions between the conserved residues of the PPi motif and substrate are limited to interactions with Mg2+·PPi; there are no direct AMP interactions (29.Tesmer J.J. Klem T.J. Deras M.L. Davisson V.J. Smith J.L. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1996; 3: 74-86Crossref PubMed Scopus (211) Google Scholar). These well isolated contacts predict that binding interactions between the enzyme and AMP may be affected only slightly by substitutions at the conserved positions. This prediction is validated by the AMP-activation data compiled in Table I. The number above the line in each data cell in Table I is the value of the kinetic constant and its standard error; below the line, the value of the constant is given relative to that of the wild-type enzyme. Representative activation data are shown in Fig. 3, A and B. The Kia values, which describe the interaction of AMP with the enzyme in the absence of Mg2+·GTP, are very similar for the wild-type and mutant enzymes; the differences are less than ∼2-fold. Similar small differences are observed in the Ka values, which describe interactions between AMP and E·Mg2+·GTP. Mutations at three out of the four conserved positions have little effect on the steady-state affinity of GTP (changes in Ki(GTP) and Km(GTP) are less than 2-fold). The exception is the D39A mutation, which decreases the steady-state affinity of Mg2+·GTP for E (8-fold) and E·AMP (5-fold). Thus, the changes in the interactions between the Asp-39 carboxylate and its environment caused by the mutation are “sensed” by the GTP-binding site and regulate its affinity for GTP. In this example, the perturbation is the exchange of a proton for the carboxylate of Asp-39. However, during the catalytic cycle, changes at that position might be caused by an event(s) such as bond cleavage or migration of Mg2+ along the tripolyphosphate chain. A change in the environment at that position reports that an event has occurred to the distal site, which responds, resulting, finally, in altered function at both sites. Such is the nature of the reaction stage-specific allostery that underlies the linkage of chemical potentials in this and other systems. It is notable that the GTP hydrolysis kcat is virtually unaffected by the mutations. Thus, the activation energetics of the rate-determining events in the catalytic cycle do not appear to be linked to the changes caused by these substitutions in the absence of Mg2+·PPi. It is important to realize that these experiments probe the interactions of a residue in a binding pocket with its environment in the absence of its ligand, Mg2+·PPi. The effects of mutating a residue integral to the molecular communication between the sites may be silent in the absence of ligand but emerge when binding of the allostere “forces” an environment that discriminates between the native and mutant residues. The Binding of PPi—The affinities of Mg2+·PPi and Mg2+·GTP for the enzyme vary markedly depending on the mutation and occupancy at the complementary site. Effects on the affinity of Mg2+·PPi for E (i.e. Kia(mutant)/Kia(wild-type)) range from a negligible 0.9-fold effect at Ser-35 to a maximum 16-fold decrease in the D39A mutant (Table II). Effects on the interactions of the enzyme and Mg2+·GTP are small; Ki(GTP) ranges from 0.5 to 3 times that of wild type. These effects are amplified at each position when the complementary ligand is docked at its active site (Table I and Fig. 4A). Thermodynamic additivity requires that destabilization caused by simultaneous occupancy of both binding sites be mutual (experienced by both ligands) and identical in magnitude. These effects are given by either Kia/Ka or Ki(GTP)/Km(GTP); moving counterclockwise around the PPi-ring, beginning with Ser-40 (Fig. 2B), the ratios are: 6.1 (S40A), 65 (D39A), 26 (G37A), and 6.7 (S35A). Thus, the binding of either ligand drives its interacting partner from the surface of the enzyme, a reversal of the native behavior, where simultaneous occupancy stabilizes binding.Table IIEffects of mutations on adenylyl transfera A kinetic constant, and its standard error, are listed above the line; beneath it, the constant is normalized to that of the wild-type enzyme.b N.D. indicates that turnover was too low to determine that constant (i.e., <3 × 10–5s–1). Open table in a new tab a A kinetic constant, and its standard error, are listed above the line; beneath it, the constant is normalized to that of the wild-type enzyme. b N.D. indicates that turnover was too low to determine that constant (i.e., <3 × 10–5s–1). Of all of the mutants studied, D39A exhibits the largest effects on ligand affinities. This mutation, in which a carboxylate is replaced by a proton, causes a small reduction in molecular volume, the loss of a negative charge, and a considerable change in bonding properties. A reduction in volume argues that the effects are more likely attributable to a loss of charge and bonding capability than to steric factors. The precise molecular basis of the effects is unknown. However, GTP binding clearly engenders an enhanced dependence on the carboxyl moiety for stable binding of Mg2+·PPi; the enzyme has become more discriminating toward Mg2+·PPi binding. Replacing the hydroxyl of either serine (40 or 35) with a proton reveals that these residues interact differently with the β-phosphoryl group, and the steric/electronic and selectivity issues discussed above also apply here. The substitution at Gly-37 differs from those at the other sites in that the molecular volume is increased, rather than decreased; a Cα-proton is replaced by a methyl group. The introduction of the methyl group affects Kia and Ka for the PPi-activated hydrolysis of GTP (7.2- and 180-fold increase, respectively) and is the only substitution that significantly affects turnover of the hydrolysis site (kcat is decreased 9-fold). Because it lacks a side chain, glycine has more energetically favorable dihedral angles available to it than other amino acids. Structures indicate that Gly-37, which is centrally positioned in the binding loop, does not interact directly with Mg2+·PPi. An analysis of the consensus features of the PPi motif in a set of 28 proteins from various species reveals that this glycine is the only absolutely conserved residue (22.Bork P. Koonin E.V. Proteins. 1994; 20: 347-355Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar). It may well be that the glycine is conserved because of the importance of its dihedral flexibility in the proper functioning of the loop and that introduction of the alanine side chain restricts the backbone dihedral angles, which reorients and changes the interactions of neighboring groups that interact directly with Mg2+·PPi. The 9-fold decrease in GTP hydrolysis that occurs when the pro-l proton of Gly-37 is replaced by a methyl group is intriguing. Our previous studies indicate that turnover of the Mg2+GTP·E·AMP·Mg2+PPi complex involves at least two partially rate-determining steps: an isomerization that precedes scission of the β,γ-bond of GTP and the release of GDP. It is reasonable, but not necessary, that this substitution affects one (or both) of these steps. Regardless of precisely where in the catalytic cycle the linkage occurs, the data clearly indicate that a rate-determining conformational change is linked to, and inhibited by, the methyl substituent, which means that Gly-37 is either part of the molecular framework that changes during the rate-determining transition or impinges upon that framework when the methyl group is added. The Adenylyl Transfer Activity—The molecular functions of the conserved PPi motif residues in adenylyl transfer reactions have not been assigned in any such system despite the fact that mutations that cause citrulinemia, an often fatal orphan disease, cluster in this motif in argininosuccinate synthetase (31.Lemke C.T. Howell P.L. Structure (Camb.). 2001; 9: 1153-1164Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar, 32.Nagata N. Matsuda I. Oyanagi K. Am. J. Med. Genet. 1991; 39: 228-229Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar). There are several parallels between the effects of mutation on the kinetic constants for GTPase activation and adenylyl transfer. Like AMP, the steady-state affinity of APS (in this case, for E and E·PPi) is only moderately affected by the mutations (0.5–6.5 times that of wild type), as shown in Table II and Fig. 4B. Representative initial rate data are shown in Fig. 3C. Thus, the addition of the sulfuryl moiety at Pα-AMP does not radically alter linkage to the PPi site. The Mg2+·PPi affinities for E and E·APS are remarkably different. In all cases, the binding of APS decreases Mg2+·PPi affinity. The sites clearly communicate in a position-dependent fashion, a finding that is not readily appreciated by inspecting the structures of adenylyltransferases. The magnitude and position dependence of the Mg2+·PPi affinity changes parallel those observed for the Mg2+·PPi/Mg2+·GTP interactions, suggesting the possibility of similar PPi loop conformations in both complexes. The effects on kcat for the synthesis of ATP and sulfate range widely across the conserved positions. Substitution of the hydroxyl at Ser-40 with a proton results in a 5-fold increase in kcat, whereas the identical substitution at Ser-35 has virtually no effect (1.4-fold). Hence, these two residues, which straddle and interact directly with the β-phosphate of ATP, are functionally non-equivalent. Given its small to negligible effects on every parameter tested, the Ser-35 hydroxyl appears to be the least catalytically involved of the conserved residues. Replacing the pro-l proton of Gly-37 with a methyl group reduces turnover to 8.5% that of wild type. Thus, rate-limiting steps are added and/or altered by the substitution, which again raises the question of a need for torsional freedom at this absolutely conserved position. Replacing the carboxyl group of Asp-39 with a proton has a profound effect on turnover; it is reduced to less that 3 × 10–5 sec–1 (the lower limit of detection). This mutant binds both AMP and PPi, and either activator simulates GTP hydrolysis, suggesting that the catalytic cycle arrests at a point following assembly of the APS·E·PPi complex. Effects on the Coupling Efficiency—The conformational coupling of the chemical potentials of the two reactions requires that the chemistries pass through conformational events that interdigitate their steps. The efficiency of these coupling events determines the degree to which the chemical potential available in one reaction is used to drive the other. Under appropriate conditions, GTP hydrolysis and APS synthesis are tightly linked in a 1:1 stoichiometry. To assess whether the conserved PPi loop residues are linked to the coupling steps of the reaction, the coupling efficiency (i.e.kcat(APS synthesis)/kcat(GTP hydrolysis)) of each mutant was compared with that of the wild-type enzyme (Fig. 3D and Table II). Efficiency was impaired in all cases; that is, the APS-forming reaction was slowed relative to GTP hydrolysis, which was only moderately affected. Thus, the energetic barriers that commit the chemistries to stepwise, 1:1, catalysis are eroded by the mutations such that one round of APS synthesis need not be completed during each round of the GTPase cycle; at some point(s), the reactions are uncoupled. It is important to realize that the APS detected in this assay is produced via the coupled pathway; this is true because the rate of uncoupled APS synthesis (i.e. in the absence of GTP) is negligible. Furthermore, activation of GTP hydrolysis, which occurs in all cases here, requires that the activating ligand(s) are bound at the APS-forming site and that an isomerization that precedes GTP hydrolysis occurs. Thus, the coupling remains sufficiently intact for the enzyme to bind ligand and move through the isomerization, produce APS and PPi, and complete the GTPase catalytic cycle at a net rate comparable with that of the wild-type enzyme. Identifying where in the catalytic cycle the APS-forming reaction arrests will help to pinpoint the energy coupling events in the mechanism, and to understand how these events are linked to the PPi-binding motif. Conclusions—The roles of specific PPi motif residues in adenylyl transfer and allosteric communication between the APS-forming and GTPase sites of ATP sulfurylase have been explored using mutagenesis. The PPi loop mutations are not linked to the binding of AMP. In the absence of Mg2+·PPi, G37A is the only mutation that significantly affects binding at the GTPase site; effects on the hydrolysis kcat are quite small. The linkage changes radically when the PPi-binding site is occupied: the effects are larger, each mutation alters the affinity of Mg2+·PPi and Mg2+·GTP for E, and certain mutants (D39A and G37A) exhibit large binding-destabilizing interactions when the sites are simultaneously occupied. D39A is the only mutant to show linkage to the transition state energetics of the hydrolysis reaction. The APS synthesis and GTP hydrolysis reactions are uncoupled to varying degrees by the mutations, all of which impede the APS-forming reaction relative to GTP hydrolysis, which is affected only slightly. The effects on adenylyl transfer catalysis range widely. kcat ranges from a 5-fold stimulation, when compared with wild-type enzyme, to no detectable turnover despite the fact that the enzyme binds substrates and communicates with the GTPase site. The mutations only slightly influence the affinity of APS for E, whereas Mg2+·PPi binding (in certain cases) is decreased substantially and a residue-dependent, destabilizing synergy is observed between the sites."
