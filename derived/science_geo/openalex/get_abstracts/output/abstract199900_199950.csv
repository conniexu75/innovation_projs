In the present communication, the infectivity of the ribonucleic acid isolated from the brains of mice infected with Semliki Forest virus is reported. This virus can also multiply in mosquitoes4 but causes no known human disease."
https://openalex.org/W2067993279,"THE enzyme transketolase is biologically widely distributed, and, in presence of thiamine pyrophosphate and magnesium ions, transfers the ketol group or ‘active glycolaldehyde’ (CH2OH.CO…H) from a variety of ketose phosphates (sedoheptulose 7-phosphate, D-fructose 6-phosphate, D-xylulose 5-phosphate), from certain free ketoses (L-erythrulose, D-xylulose) and from hydroxypyruvic acid to certain ‘acceptor aldehydes’, thus synthesizing new ketoses. The ‘acceptor aldehydes’ hitherto recognized are D-glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate, D-ribose 5-phosphate, D-erythrose 4-phosphate and 2-deoxyribose 5-phosphate; also free glyceraldehyde and glycolaldehyde (for reviews see refs. 1–3). Acetaldehyde and formaldehyde are stated not to be acceptors4, but the former appears in our preliminary tests to be weakly active."

https://openalex.org/W2013837641,"RATS fed on diets containing certain yeasts as their sole source of protein develop a dietary necrotic liver degeneration, leading to early and rapid death. Necrogenic diets are deficient in three factors, vitamin E1, cystine2 and a ‘Factor 3’3, each of which will alone prevent the manifestations of disease. Potent Factor 3 concentrates have been prepared from casein hydrolysates4 and, recently, Schwarz and Foltz5 have shown that similar concentrates prepared from kidney powder hydrolysates contain selenium in bound form. Addition of sodium selenite to rat diets (to supply 4 µgm. of selenium per 100 gm. of diet) gave complete protection against death from liver necrosis during the experimental period of thirty days, indicating that selenium might be part of Factor 3. Schwarz and Foltz have inferred that “selenium is an essential trace element”."

https://openalex.org/W2028871807,"IT was shown by Nicol and his co-workers1,2 that œstrogens, both natural and synthetic, stimulate the phagocytic activity of the reticulo-endothelial system, while cortisone depresses phagocytosis, and also the total and differential white cell counts in the blood and the gamma-globulin level in the serum. On the other hand, if cortisone treatment is stopped, the depressant action of the cortisone can be reversed and converted into one of moderate stimulation by diethyl stilbœstrol; and, further, if cortisone and diethyl stilbœstrol are administered separately but at the same time, the depressant action of the cortisone is prevented and considerable stimulation of phagocytic activity occurs3. According to Florey4 it is possible that some chemotherapeutic agents depend for their complete effectiveness on the action of phagocytes; he also states that in acute infections the organisms are generally killed or inhibited by the use of chemotherapeutic drugs."

https://openalex.org/W2048660614,"RECENTLY, Zamenhof et al.
1 described experiments which demonstrated the occurrence of pinpoint mutant colonies in Escherichia coli. These mutants arose in experiments in which 5-bromo-uracil was used as a mutagenic agent, and the pinpoint colonies were shown to be of three types: stable, unstable and very unstable. The unstable pinpoints were maintained for seven transfers, while the very unstable pinpoints were lost after only 12 hr. of growth."

1/2 after-potential following the second and following spikes. All the experiments were performed on the green frog Hyla coerulea at a temperature of 22° C."

https://openalex.org/W2066098960,"THE small quantities of hydrogen peroxide produced in culture media and also by some antituberculous substances are thought to have an inhibitory effect on catalase-negative strains of Mycobacterium tuberculosis resistant to isoniazid1 2. In studying this problem an indirect polarographic method has proved a sensitive and accurate way of estimating peroxide. Although direct polarographic estimation of hydrogen peroxide is possible in some simple media, the decomposition current of more complex media may obscure the hydrogen peroxide wave."
