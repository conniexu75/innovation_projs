In one group of patients this lack appears to result from failure to synthesize the esterase inhibitor of the first component of complement, whereas in another group of patients an abnormal, nonfunctional protein is synthesized."

https://openalex.org/W2011582966,"The phenol oxidase systems of Drosophila melanogaster arise from at least four protein components. One A component plus the P preparation yields tyrosinase, while the other two (A(2) and A(3)) yield primarily 3,4-dihydroxyphenylalanine oxidases. Probably the four components represent specialized subunits of the oxidases produced."

A model based on the assumption that antibodies are complex (cross-reacting) permits simpler, more uniform, and less prejudicing interpretations of immunogenetic systems than when antibodies are regarded as simple (specific)."

https://openalex.org/W2017147479,"SINCE 1947, reports have reached us of excessive salivation in ruminants after consuming certain forages. Frequently these forages were red clover hay, but other types of forages were involved. The cattle would consume from 1 to 3 feedings of such forage, salivate excessively, and then refuse further feed. The refusal of the cattle to consume ‘slobber forage’ represents an economic loss to the farmer, including a loss of milk production and the necessity of purchasing replacement forage."

https://openalex.org/W2048717240,"IN a previous paper1 we have shown that tyramine releases catecholamines but not ATP from isolated medullary granules, and that the released catecholamines are almost quantitatively replaced by the uptake of equimolar amounts of tyramine. Segontin [N-(3′-phenylpropyl-(2′))-1,1-diphenylpropyl-(3)-amine], a potent, dilator of the coronaries, causes, in vitro as well as in vivo, a release of catecholamines from the medullary granules2. In order to determine whether segontin acts like tyramine by displacing catecholamines from their binding sites we investigated the release of catecholamines and ATP by segontin and its uptake into the chromaffin granules. For comparison, experiments with reserpine were undertaken, as it is known that this compound also releases catecholamines from medullary granules in vivo and in vitro3,4."

https://openalex.org/W2053401409,"Two different temperature-sensitive conditional-lethal mutants of Sindbis virus, an animal virus that contains RNA, have been isolated. When cultured in chick fibroblast monolayers at 42 degrees C, these mutants yield less than 0.05 percent as much virus as does the wild type, whereas at 27 degrees C they grow normally. One mutant appears to be altered in the synthesis of a protein that is produced early in the infection and is required for viral RNA synthesis. The other mutant produces as much infectious RNA as the wild type at 42 degrees C and appears to be altered in the synthesis of a protein produced late in the infection."

https://openalex.org/W2078232963,"THE importance of nucleoproteins in antibody-globulin production is well known1,2. In previous experiments3,4 an evident increase of the content of RNA in the γ-globulin fraction in immune sera has been observed. The RNA extracted from the serum of immunized rabbits is capable of eliciting in normal rabbits the production of antibodies against the same antigens used for immunizing the animals from which this RNA-immuno-carrier (RNA-I-C) was taken. The following investigations were undertaken to ascertain whether an RNA-I-C extracted from the serum of immunized animals of one species was able to induce antibody production in animals of a different species."

https://openalex.org/W2018522848,"THE so-called ‘jerboa marsupial’ of Australia (Antechinomys) is widely held to be bipedal and convergent on bipedal saltatory murids or jumping mice (Notomys); various species of these occur in identical localities with Antechinomys in rather arid parts of Australia from Western Australia to Queensland. This interpretation of locomotion in Antechinomys is to be found in most general works on Australian marsupials and, as an example of evolutionary convergence, in zoological text-books1–4."

https://openalex.org/W2000365431,"IN the rabbit's skin chronically treated with croton oil a remarkable change is observed in the ratio between hyaluronic acid and chondroitin sulphuric acid, the former largely prevailing over the latter after one month's treatment; the same change occurs when the skin is treated with carcinogenic substances1. These data supplement what is already known about the presence of mucopolysaccharides in inflammatory processes (see, for references up to 1959, Delaunay and Bazin2 and, more recently, Berenson and Dalferes3, White et al.4, Zonta et al.5). So far as we know, no data are available concerning the changes induced in the metabolism of mucopolysaccharides by those stimuli which elicit inflammation. The present work was concerned with the dynamics of the metabolism of acid mucopolysaccharides of the rabbit's skin treated for short periods of time with croton oil, evaluating the incorporation into them of glucose (as glucosamine and galactosamine)."

https://openalex.org/W2063748993,"CYSTEAMINE has been shown to cause a transient inhibition of diamine oxidase1, which was explained by its coupling with pyridoxal phosphate in a thiazolidine ring. Even when linked to pyridoxal phosphate thiols may undergo oxidation to the corresponding disulphides2,3 in the case of cysteamine the non-enzymatic oxidation to cystamine liberates pyridoxal phosphate, and the diamine oxidase activity is restored. Because the enzyme oxidizes cystamine4, we have an interesting example of an inhibitor which is changed into a substrate during the reaction."

https://openalex.org/W3026217014,IN previous investigations we were able to demonstrate that elimination of 90Sr is enhanced in lactating rats1–4. Similar findings were reported by other investigators under various experimental arrangements and with various experimental animals5–10. To gain more quantitative information on Sr-metabolism in the course of lactation the following experiment has been performed.

https://openalex.org/W2043286058,"The volume of a frog sartorius muscle increases during a single twitch and subsequently decreases. The magnitude of volume change is 10(-5) cm(3) per gram of muscle. The time courses of change in volume and of onset of tension vary with temperature in a similar way, which implies a relation between the volume changes and the contraction mechanism. The character of the change depends upon the initial length of the muscle: the greatest decrease accompanies an isometric twitch at reference length. Treatment of the muscle with an iodide Ringer solution prolongs the active state and the volume change. These results suggest a correlation between the volume changes and the active state."

The amount retained by the body initially may be calculated from the amount of radiostrontium excreted in the feces in the first few days."
