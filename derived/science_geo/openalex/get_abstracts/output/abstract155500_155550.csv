https://openalex.org/W2144087168,"A solid state, electronically addressable, bistable [2]catenane-based molecular switching device was fabricated from a single monolayer of the [2]catenane, anchored with phospholipid counterions, and sandwiched between an n-type polycrystalline silicon bottom electrode and a metallic top electrode. The device exhibits hysteretic (bistable) current/voltage characteristics. The switch is opened at +2 volts, closed at -2 volts, and read at approximately 0.1 volt and may be recycled many times under ambient conditions. A mechanochemical mechanism for the action of the switch is presented and shown to be consistent with temperature-dependent measurements of the device operation."

To clone pigs from differentiated cells, we microinjected the nuclei of porcine (Sus scrofa) fetal fibroblasts into enucleated oocytes, and development was induced by electroactivation. The transfer of 110 cloned embryos to four surrogate mothers produced an apparently normal female piglet. The clonal provenance of the piglet was indicated by her coat color and confirmed by DNA microsatellite analysis."

Recognizing the catalytic importance of substrate-binding exosites outside the catalytic domain, we screened for extracellular substrates using the gelatinase A hemopexin domain as bait in the yeast two-hybrid system. Monocyte chemoattractant protein-3 (MCP-3) was identified as a physiological substrate of gelatinase A. Cleaved MCP-3 binds to CC-chemokine receptors-1, -2, and -3, but no longer induces calcium fluxes or promotes chemotaxis, and instead acts as a general chemokine antagonist that dampens inflammation. This suggests that matrix metalloproteinases are both effectors and regulators of the inflammatory response."
https://openalex.org/W2149811610,"TR3, an immediate-early response gene and an orphan member of the steroid-thyroid hormone-retinoid receptor superfamily of transcription factors, regulates apoptosis through an unknown mechanism. In response to apoptotic stimuli, TR3 translocates from the nucleus to mitochondria to induce cytochrome c release and apoptosis. Mitochondrial targeting of TR3, but not its DNA binding and transactivation, is essential for its proapoptotic effect. Our results reveal a mechanism by which a nuclear transcription factor translocates to mitochondria to initiate apoptosis."

It is often assumed that such links involve only multimodal neural structures, but unimodal brain areas may also be affected. We tested the effect of simultaneous visuo-tactile stimulation on the activity of the human visual cortex. Tactile stimulation enhanced activity in the visual cortex, but only when it was on the same side as a visual target. Analysis of effective connectivity between brain areas suggests that touch influences unimodal visual cortex via back-projections from multimodal parietal areas. This provides a neural explanation for crossmodal links in spatial attention."

Recent studies revealed that AKT regulates a variety of cellular functions including cell survival, cell growth, cell differentiation, cell cycle progression, transcription, translation, and cellular metabolism. To clarify the substrate specificity of AKT, we have used an oriented peptide library approach to determine optimal amino acids at positions N-terminal and C-terminal to the site of phosphorylation. The predicted optimal peptide substrate (Arg-Lys-Arg-Xaa-Arg-Thr-Tyr-Ser*-Phe-Gly where Ser* is the phosphorylation site) has similarities to but is distinct from optimal substrates that we previously defined for related basophilic protein kinases such as protein kinase A, Ser/Arg-rich kinases, and protein kinase C family members. The positions most important for highV max/K m ratio were Arg-3>Arg-5>Arg-7. The substrate specificity of AKT was further investigated by screening a λGEX phage HeLa cell cDNA expression library. All of the substrates identified by this procedure contained Arg-Xaa-Arg-Xaa-Xaa-(Ser/Thr) motifs and were in close agreement with the motif identified by peptide library screening.

Although there may be multiple mechanisms for phosphorylation at Ser-473, recent studies indicate that phosphorylation is enhanced by PDK-1-dependent phosphorylation of Thr-308 and is dependent on a kinase-active AKT supporting an autophosphorylation model (22Toker A.

However, identification of in vivo substrates of protein kinases is complicated by the existence of protein kinase cascades. Thus, even ifin vivo phosphorylation of a specific site on a protein is blocked by disrupting the function of a single protein kinase, one cannot conclude that the kinase of interest directly phosphorylates the site. A downstream kinase could be responsible. Support for direct phosphorylation can be obtained by demonstrating that the site is preferentially phosphorylated by the kinase of interest in a purein vitro assay. Knowledge of the optimal motif of a protein kinase can also accelerate discovery of targets by allowing prediction of sites from a global search of genome sequences or by a restricted search of candidate proteins. Ultimately, such predictions must be tested by both in vivo and in vitroexperiments.Recently, a number of in vivo and/or in vitrostudies have suggested substrates for AKT, including BAD (24Datta S.R.

The sites identified in these substrates define a minimal motif, Arg-Xaa-Arg-Xaa-Xaa-(Ser/Thr), that is similar to motifs identified for some of the PKC family members (42Nishikawa K. Toker A.

Chem. 1997; 272: 952-960Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (489) Google Scholar).In this study, to better understand the substrate specificity of AKT and compare it to other basophilic protein kinases, we have used a degenerate peptide library approach that provides an unbiased evaluation of the importance of the residues surrounding the site of phosphorylation for an optimal substrate. To further test the specificity in a protein context and to identify candidate substrates, we performed phosphorylation screening of a λ phage cDNA expression library for AKT using purified protein kinase and [γ-32P]ATP, and searched for evidence of AKT phosphorylation motifs within these newly identified substrates.DISCUSSIONIn this study, we have determined the optimal phosphorylation motif for Akt by oriented peptide library screening and corroborated the result by identifying similar motifs in AKT protein substrates isolated by screening of a HeLa cell cDNA expression library. The optimal motif was confirmed by a detailed kinetic analysis of individual peptides containing Ala substitutions at positions within the motif. We constructed a non-phosphorylatable substrate analog, and showed that this peptide could function as a competitive inhibitor of AKT phosphorylation in vitro.As shown in Table II, most known physiological substrates of AKT have Arg at both the −3 and −5 positions and hydrophobic amino acids (e.g. Phe) in the +1 position. However several other basophilic protein kinases have similar requirements for optimal substrates. For example, PKCα, PKCγ, and PKCδ also select substrates with Arg at −3 and −5 and Phe at +1 (TableV). A distinguishing feature of optimal AKT substrate is selection for residues at S+2 that form tight turns (e.g. Gly), in contrast to optimal PKC substrates which select for basic or aromatic residues in the S+2 position. In addition, selection for Thr at S−2 also distinguishes AKT from all other basophilic kinases investigated to date (Table I and Table V). Thus, the information provided by peptide library screening can help to distinguish AKT phosphorylation sites from sites likely to be phosphorylated by other related basophilic protein kinases. Our results are in good agreement with those of Alessi et al. (50Alessi D.R. Caudwell F.B. Andjelkovic M. Hemmings B.A. Cohen P. FEBS Lett. 1996; 399: 333-338Crossref PubMed Scopus (550) Google Scholar) who showed that substitution of Ala for Arg in the S−5 or S−3 positions or Ala for Phe in the S+1 position of a peptide derived from the AKT phosphorylation site in GSK3 resulted in reduced phosphorylation. Our results also agree with those of Kobayashi and Cohen (51Kobayashi, T., and Cohen, P. (1999) Biochem. J. 319–328.Google Scholar) who found a critical dependence on Arg in the S−3 position. Mutation of this residue, even to Lys, another basic amino acid, severely compromised the ability of AKT to phosphorylate a peptide substrate. Similarly, Kobayashi and Cohen (51Kobayashi, T., and Cohen, P. (1999) Biochem. J. 319–328.Google Scholar) reported that mutation of Phe in the S+1 position to the charged amino acids Lys or Glu decreased the efficiency of phosphorylation by 30 and 13%, respectively. In agreement with these data, Phe was the optimal residue in the S+1 position by peptide library screening, and as shown in Table I, most known substrates of Akt have hydrophobic amino acids (often Phe) in this position.Table VComparison of the substrate specificities of basophilic protein kinases determined by soluble oriented peptide library screening−7−6−5−4−3−2−10+1+2+3+4+5PKARRRRSIIFIPKCαRRRRRKGSFRRKAPKCβ I, IIRKLKRKGSFRRKAPKCγRRRRRKGSFKKFAPKCδAARKRKGSFFYGGPKCɛYYXKRKMSFFEFDPKCηARLRRRRSFRRXRPKCζRRFKRQGSFFYFFPKCμAALVRQMSVAFFFCaM kinase IIKRQQSFDLFPhosphorylase kinaseFRMMSFFLFSLK1RRFGSLRRFSRPK2RRRHSRRRRAKT/PKBRKRXRTYSFGA list of motifs obtained by soluble peptide library screening for a variety of basophilic Ser/Thr protein kinase is shown.

To rationalize the substrate specificity we observed for AKT, we modeled the structure of the AKT kinase domain using the x-ray structure of the PKA·PKI·ATP ternary complex as a basis set. The resulting molecular surface of the modeled AKT protein, shaded by electrostatic potential, is shown in Fig.5. All of the basophilic kinases in TableV preferentially phosphorylate substrates with Arg in the S−3 position. These results can be rationalized by a weakly acidic pocket in PKA at the S−3 position (Fig. 5, red) with contributions from both a highly conserved acidic residue (Glu-127 in PKA; Glu-234 in AKT) that salt bridges to the guanidino nitrogens and the proximity of the β- and γ-phosphates of ATP to this residue. In addition, both PKC and AKT contain residues predicted to form an acidic patch at the S−5 position (e.g. Asp-467, Glu-530, and Asp-503 of PKCα and Glu-278, Glu-341, and Glu-314 in AKT that loosely map to the S−2 pocket in PKA (Glu-170, Glu-230, and Glu-202)). Similarly, nearly all basophilic kinases contain a hydrophobic pocket at S+1 which is particularly deep in the case of AKT (e.g. Phe-309, Pro-313, and Leu-316) rationalizing selection for Phe in the S+1 position. As discussed above, the selection for peptides with residues at S+2 that tend to form tight turns is unique to AKT. This may be explained if the substrate binding cleft terminates at this position, forcing a tight turn to exit the pocket. Interestingly, several of the in vivo substrates of AKT have Pro at the S+2 position and are known to bind to 14-3-3 proteins after phosphorylation (53Yaffe M.B. Cantley L.C. Nature. 1999; 402: 30-31Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar, 54Yaffe M.B. Rittinger K. Volinia S. Caron P.R. Aitken A. Leffers H. Gamblin S.J. Smerdon S.J. Cantley L.C.

In addition, tight binding to 14-3-3 protein is favored by Arg at S−3 and Ser or Thr at S−2 and is further facilitated by Arg at S−5 (54Yaffe M.B. Rittinger K. Volinia S. Caron P.R. Aitken A.

Thus, AKT appears to have evolved a substrate selection that is skewed toward motifs recognized by 14-3-3 proteins. Consistent with this idea, the sites on Forkhead-related proteins that are phosphorylated by AKT and bind to 14-3-3 are highly conserved from Caenorhabditis elegans to mammals (Table VI).Table VIComparison of the AKT phosphorylation sites of Daf-16 family members with the predicted optimal motifs for AKT and for 14-3-3 bindingPosition−7−6−5−4−3−2−10+1+2Optimal 14-3-3 binding motifRRRSQ/Y/FpSL/E/A/MPOptimal AKT phosphorylation motifRKRXRTY/F/G/MSF/MG/T/SAKT phosphorylation sites in C. elegans Daf-16 and mammalian homologs Daf-16a (T54)IPRDRCNTWP Daf-16b (T19)EPRGRCYTWP FKHRL1 (T31)QSRPRSCTWP FKHR (T23)LPRPRSCTWP AFX (T27)QSRPRSCTWPThe AKT phosphorylation motif is from Table I.

Open table in a new tab Identification of in Vitro AKT SubstratesSeveral newin vitro AKT substrates were identified using solid-phase phosphorylation screening. Many of the positive clones we identified were spliceosomal proteins. This selection may result, in part, from cDNA bias, because spliceosomal proteins tend to be expressed in relatively large amounts within cells (56Varani G. Nagai K. Annu. Rev. Biophys. Biomol. Struct. 1998; 27: 407-445Crossref PubMed Scopus (250) Google Scholar). Furthermore, many have Arg/Ser (RS)-rich domains that are the targets for SR kinase-mediated phosphorylation events. These Arg/Ser domains frequently contain multiple AKT phosphorylation motifs lying within narrow stretches of sequence, as described for Zis above. The splicing factor SC35, for example, has more than 20 possible AKT phosphorylation motifs in its protein sequence. When the entire GenPept data base was searched using a profile-based bioinformatics program and the optimal consensus motif determined for AKT, 2M. B. Yaffe, G. G. Leparc, J. Lai, T. Obata, S. Volinia, and L. C. Cantley, submitted for publication. 81 of the top 300 scoring sequences were spliceosomal proteins. Thus there is consistency between the peptide library screening/data base search approach and an independent cDNA expression library screening for AKT substrates. Intriguingly, this bioinformatics search also identified all known AKT substrates including BAD, and members of the Forkhead transcription factor family. An AKT phosphorylation site on mTOR, the mammalian target of rapamycin, at Ser-2448 was also identified, and this site has recently been reported by Nave et al. (37Nave B.T. Ouwens M. Withers D.J. Alessi D.R. Shepherd P.R. Biochem. J. 1999; 2: 427-431Crossref Google Scholar).The relevance of our finding that many proteins involved in RNA processing and previously identified as substrates of SR kinases are also good substrates for AKT is not yet clear. This may reflect similarities between optimal substrates for SR kinases and AKT (TableV). One major difference between SR kinases and AKT is that SR kinases prefer substrates with Arg at the S+1 position (52Wang H.Y. Lin W. Dyck J.A. Yeakley J.M. Songyang Z. Cantley L.C. Fu X.D. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 140: 737-750Crossref PubMed Scopus (250) Google Scholar), whereas AKT prefers hydrophobic residues. Thus, the substrates in Table IV with Arg at S+1 are more likely to be SR kinase substrates in vivowhereas those with hydrophobic residues at S+1 are good candidates forin vivo AKT substrates. Further work will be necessary to evaluate the in vivo relevance of these candidate substrates.AKT is known to participate in a wide range of normal cell functions and up-regulation of its activity has been noted in a variety of neoplasms. Identification of the optimal substrate motif using oriented peptide library screening and protein library screening should facilitate the identification of additional in vivo AKT targets relevant to tumorigenesis and cancer progression. The AKT protein kinase (also referred to as protein kinase B or Rac-protein kinase) was initially identified as an acute transforming component of the AKT8 virus isolated from a murine T cell lymphoma (1Staal S.P.

https://openalex.org/W2052232788,"We studied catalysis by tetrahydrobiopterin (H4B)-free neuronal nitric-oxide synthase (nNOS) to understand how heme and H4B participate in nitric oxide (NO) synthesis. H4B-free nNOS catalyzed Arg oxidation toN ω-hydroxy-l-Arg (NOHA) and citrulline in both NADPH- and H2O2-driven reactions. Citrulline formation was time- and enzyme concentration-dependent but was uncoupled relative to NADPH oxidation, and generated nitrite and nitrate without forming NO. Similar results were observed when NOHA served as substrate. Steady-state and stopped-flow spectroscopy with the H4B-free enzyme revealed that a ferrous heme-NO complex built up after initiating catalysis in both NADPH- and H2O2-driven reactions, consistent with formation of nitroxyl as an immediate product. This differed from the H4B-replete enzyme, which formed a ferric heme-NO complex as an immediate product that could then release NO. We make the following conclusions. 1) H4B is not essential for Arg oxidation by nNOS, although it helps couple NADPH oxidation to product formation in both steps of NO synthesis. Thus, the NADPH- or H2O2-driven reactions form common heme-oxy species that can react with substrate in the presence or absence of H4B. 2) The sole essential role of H4B is to enable nNOS to generate NO instead of nitroxyl.

All NOSs are homodimers with subunits comprising an N-terminal oxygenase domain with binding sites for heme, 6R-tetrahydrobiopterin (H4B), and Arg, and a C-terminal reductase domain with binding sites for FMN, FAD, and NADPH (4Marletta M.A. Hurshman A.R.

In fact, both steps of NO synthesis are envisioned to involve heme-based oxygen activation and catalysis. However, NOS also requires H4B, and given that H4B is not required for heme reduction (15Presta A. Weber-Main A.M. Stankovich M.T. Stuehr D.J. J. Am. Chem.

Aromatic amino acid hydroxylases use H4B as an electron donor for oxygen activation (22Kappock T.J. Caradonna J.P. Chem. Rev. 1996; 96: 1659-2756Crossref Scopus (290) Google Scholar, 23Kaufman S.

Indeed, Hurshman et al. (25Hurshman A.R. Krebs C. Edmondson D.E. Huynh B.H. Marletta M.A. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 15689-15696Crossref PubMed Scopus (216) Google Scholar) recently used freeze-quench EPR to demonstrate that some H4B can convert to an H4B radical during reaction of ferrous NOS oxygenase domain with O2. Although this shows how H4B could participate in oxygen activation by donating an electron to the ferrous-dioxy heme, to what extent this takes place during normal NO synthesis is unknown. Clearly, electron donation from H4B is not required for NOHA oxidation, because H4B-free NOS catalyzes oxidation of NOHA to citrulline and nitroxyl (NO−) in either an NADPH- or H2O2-driven reaction (26Rusche K.M. Spiering M.M. Marletta M.A. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 15503-15512Crossref PubMed Scopus (169) Google Scholar,27Clague M.J. Wishnok J.S.

In these same systems, Arg oxidation was not observed, leading the authors to conclude that H4B is essential for Arg hydroxylation. However, this is a troublesome proposal because it means that H4B's role in oxygen activation depends on the identity of the substrate, or implies that reactivity of NOS heme-oxy species somehow differ in the presence or absence of H4B. In addition, it is still unclear how NOHA oxidation by H4B-bound NOS generates NO rather than NO−. To address these issues, we extensively investigated Arg and NOHA oxidation by H4B-free neuronal NOS (nNOS). Our results reveal that nNOS does indeed catalyze oxidation of both Arg 2While this manuscript was in review, Gacchui and colleagues (43Adhikari S. Ray S. Gachhui R.

This result, together with stopped-flow data, enable us to propose a simple, unified mechanism for heme-based oxygen activation, reactivity, and H4B participation in both steps of NO synthesis.

The protein as isolated was free of Arg and H4B and was low spin as judged by a Soret peak at 420 nm. The nNOS concentration was estimated based on the absorbance of its ferrous heme-CO adduct as previously reported (28Adak S. Ghosh S. Abu-Soud H.M. Stuehr D.J. J. Biol.

NO-mediated conversion of oxyhemoglobin to methemoglobin was monitored over time at 401 nm and quantitated using a difference extinction coefficient of 38,000 m−1cm−1. NADPH oxidation at 25 °C was quantitated at 340 nm using an extinction coefficient of 6,220m−1 cm−1. The assay mixture was identical to the NO synthesis measurement except that oxyhemoglobin was absent. H2O2-dependent nNOS oxidation of Arg or NOHA to nitrite was assayed in 96-well microplates at 25 °C. Each well contained 40 mm EPPS, pH 7.6, 0.6 μm nNOS, 1 mm Arg, 1 mmDTT, 25 units/ml superoxide dismutase, 0.5 mm EDTA, and with or without 100 μm H4B. For NOHA oxidation the enzyme concentration was reduced to 0.06 μm. Reactions were initiated by adding 30 mm H2O2 and stopped after 10 min by adding 1300 units of catalase. Nitrite was detected at 550 nm using the Griess reagent (100 μl) and quantitated based on a nitrite standard curve. H4B-free nNOS (0.5 μm) or H4B-bound nNOS (50 nm) was added to 96-well microplates containing 40 mm EPPS, pH 7.6, 150 μg/ml CaM, 0.62 mmCaCl2, 0.3 mm DTT, 1 mm Arg or NOHA, 4 μm each of FAD and FMN, 100 units catalase, and 25 units/ml superoxide dismutase to give a final volume 100 μl. The reaction was started by adding NADPH to give 1.0 mm and stopped after 25 min by adding excess EDTA. Nitrate reductase (1 μm) was added, and the plates were incubated for 2 h at room temperature to reduce nitrate. Excess NADPH was then oxidized by adding lactate dehydrogenase and pyruvate, and total nitrite plus nitrate was detected by adding Griess reagent and reading at 550 nm. Optical spectra were recorded on a Hitachi 3010 UV-visible spectrophotometer. Anaerobic spectra were recorded using septum-sealed quartz cuvettes that could be attached through a quick-fit joint to a vacuum system. The nNOS samples were made anaerobic by repeated cycles of evacuation and equilibrated with catalyst-deoxygenated N2. A separate buffer solution containing cofactors was evacuated and gassed with N2 in a separate vessel and then transferred into the anaerobic cuvette. All transfers were made using gas tight syringes. The stopped-flow instrument was attached to a rapid-scanning diode array device (Hi-Tech model MG-6000) designed to collect 96 spectra in a specific time frame. Experiments for H2O2-dependent reactions involved mixing an anaerobic solution containing 6 μm nNOSoxy and 1 mm NOHA with anaerobic buffer solution containing 2 mm H2O2. In some cases the enzyme solution also contained 10 μm H4B. Experiments with O2-dependent reactions involved mixing an anaerobic solution of 16 μm ferrous nNOSoxy containing 20 μm H4B and 2 mm NOHA with aerobic buffer solution. H4B-free nNOS was diluted to 4 μm in air-saturated 40 mm EPPS buffer, pH 7.6, containing 6.0 μm CaM, 0.2 mm DTT or β-mercaptoethanol, 0.9 mm EDTA, 24 μm NADPH, 1.0 mmArg or NOHA, 0.5 mm glucose 6-phosphate, and 2 units of glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase; final volume was 0.5 ml. Reactions were started by adding 2 mm Ca2+ and monitored by wavelength scanning at 25 °C in the Hitachi U3010 spectrophotometer. In some cases, substrate was omitted and CO gas was bubbled into the cuvette after initiating catalysis as explained in the text. For stopped-flow rapid scanning experiments, conditions were identical except that an NADPH-regenerating system was not used; the final concentrations of NADPH and nNOS were 40 and 2 μm, respectively, and the temperature was 15 °C. Amino acids were derivatized by o-phthalaldehyde (OPA) and separated by reverse-phase HPLC, using an Waters model 510 instrument with a Waters 470 scanning fluorescence detector, Waters 715 Ultra Wisp Sampler Processor, and a Hewlett Packard ODS Hypersil 5-μm 100 × 21-mm C18 column (Hewlett Packard 79916 OD-552), equipped with a C18 guard column (2.1 mm, inner diameter, ODS Hypersil, 5 μm, Hewlett Packard 79916KT-110). The injector was set to mix 60 μl of an OPA reaction solution (4 mg of OPA dissolved in 0.5 ml of methanol to which 4.5 ml of 0.1 m sodium borate, pH 10, and 30 μl of β-mercaptoethanol were added) with a 40-μl reaction sample. After reacting for 2 min, the samples were automatically applied to the column, which was equilibrated with 5 mm ammonium acetate (pH 6.0) containing 20% methanol (v/v) (solvent A) run at 0.5 ml/min at room temperature. The elution conditions for the OPA derivatives were 0–50% solvent B (methanol) over 9 min, followed by a linear increase to 100% methanol over the next 0.5 min, 100% methanol for 3 min, and a return to 100% solvent A over the next 0.5 min. Amino acid standards were used to quantify the samples. Citrulline, NOHA, and Arg standards had retention times of.6.2, 10.2, and 12.1 min, respectively, and the peaks were completely resolved. Amino acids were detected by fluorescence emission (excitation 360 nm and emission 455 nm) and quantitated based on authentic prepared standards. H4B-free nNOS generated detectable amounts of citrulline 3Under the conditions of our HPLC analysis, any cyanoornithine produced would have been detected as citrulline. and nitrite plus nitrate from Arg when the reactions contained relatively high concentrations of enzyme (Fig. 1, TableI). NOHA was also detected as a product, indicating that it forms as an intermediate in the reaction catalyzed by H4B-free enzyme. When NOHA was used in place of Arg as a substrate it also was converted to citrulline and nitrite plus nitrate by H4B-free nNOS (Fig. 1, Table I), as shown previously with inducible NOS (26Rusche K.M. Spiering M.M. Marletta M.A. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 15503-15512Crossref PubMed Scopus (169) Google Scholar). Citrulline formation from Arg or NOHA was 10 or 15%, respectively, compared with the H4B-replete enzyme 4The activity of our H4B-reconstituted nNOS was 25 ± 2 min−1 at room temperature when assayed by the oxyhemoglobin assay. This represents 50% of the activity we observe for nNOS purified in the presence of H4B. in reactions run under otherwise identical conditions (Table I). A somewhat greater proportion of nitrate was generated in reactions catalyzed by the H4B-free enzyme. Control reactions run in the absence of substrate, nNOS, or NADPH did not generate detectable citrulline or nitrite plus nitrate. Including catalase and superoxide dismutase did not diminish product formation in any case. We conclude that H4B is not essential for nNOS to oxidize either Arg or NOHA to citrulline and nitrite plus nitrate in the NADPH-driven reaction. Our results are the first to show that the Arg reaction can occur in an H4B-free NOS.2 As shown in Fig. 2, NADPH-driven citrulline formation from Arg or NOHA was time-dependent (left panel) and gave initial rates of 2 and 5 min−1, respectively. The reaction was also dependent on nNOS concentration until it reached a point where all NADPH was exhausted within the time of assay (above 500 nmnNOS, right panel). Importantly, citrulline production was associated with no detectable NO synthesis, even under assay conditions where a single NO per heme would have been detected. This implies the H4B-free nNOS formed a nitrogen oxide product other than NO that could oxidize to nitrite and nitrate.Table IComparative activities of nNOS in NADPH-driven reactions at 25 °CExperimentCitrulline producedNOHA producedNO2− + NO3− producedmol/mol nNOSmol/mol nNOSmol/mol nNOSE + Arg + NADPH 1-aE, nNOS; NA, not applicable; ND, not detectable.44 ± 428 ± 245 ± 5E + Arg + H4B + NADPH458 ± 3082 ± 8352 ± 30E + NOHA + NADPH108 ± 10NA70 ± 6E + NOHA + H4B + NADPH745 ± 60NA554 ± 50Arg + H4B + NADPHNDNDNDE + H4B + NADPHNDNDNDE + H4B + ArgNDNDNDIncubations were run for 25 min prior to quenching as described under “Experimental Procedures.” The values are the mean ± S.D. of three measurements.1-a E, nNOS; NA, not applicable; ND, not detectable.

We next determined the stoichiometric relationship between NADPH consumption and citrulline formation by H4B-free nNOS (Fig.3). Reactions contained different amounts of NADPH, and the total citrulline produced was determined after all the NADPH was consumed. The slopes indicate that conversion of 1 mol of Arg or NOHA to citrulline was associated with oxidation of 16 and 6 mol of NADPH, respectively. For the same nNOS preparation made replete with H4B, the values were approximately 2 NADPH oxidized per citrulline from Arg, and 0.5 NADPH oxidized per citrulline from NOHA (data not shown), which are close to the theoretical minimum values (7Griffith O.W. Stuehr D.J. Annu. Rev. Physiol. 1995; 57: 707-736Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The uncoupling seen under H4B-free conditions was not due to structural changes, because H2B, which mimics all the structural effects of H4B (17Presta A. Siddhanta U. Wu C. Sennequier N. Huang L. Abu-Soud H.M. Erzurum S. Stuehr D.J. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 298-310Crossref PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar, 30Crane B.R. Arvai A.S. Ghosh S. Getzoff E.D. Stuehr D.J. Tainer J.A. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 4608-4621Crossref PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar), did not enhance coupling (data not shown). Our analysis indicates that NADPH oxidation in H4B-free nNOS is uncoupled from either Arg or NOHA oxidation to citrulline in a multiple turnover setting. To investigate the mechanism of the H4B-independent reaction and identify the nitrogen oxide product, we utilized spectroscopy to observe the enzyme during catalysis. In Fig. 4spectra of H4B-free nNOS were recorded before or after initiating its aerobic NADPH oxidation at 25 °C in the absence or presence of substrate. Sequential scans were recorded of the CaM-free resting ferric enzyme, after adding NADPH to reduce the flavins, and after adding Ca2+ to trigger CaM binding, heme reduction, and catalysis. In the absence of substrate (panel A), the light absorbance spectrum of the CaM- and H4B-free ferric NOS was a mixture of high and low spin heme with a prominent heme Soret band at 420 nm, consistent with its lack of bound H4B (31Roman L.J. Sheta E.A. Martasek P. Gross S.S. Lin Q. Masters B.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 8428-8432Crossref PubMed Scopus (244) Google Scholar). Adding NADPH caused losses in visible absorbance between 360 and 420 nm, 440 and 520 nm, and 560 and 680 nm, and buildup of a broad absorbance centered near 365 nm, consistent with reduction of nNOS flavins. After adding Ca2+ to trigger steady state NADPH oxidation, we observed some decrease in absorbance between 390 and 420 nm and at 650 nm, consistent with heme reduction occurring in the substrate- and H4B-free nNOS (15Presta A. Weber-Main A.M. Stankovich M.T. Stuehr D.J. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1998; 120: 9460-9465Crossref Scopus (101) Google Scholar). The inset of panel A also shows significant heme reduction occurred as is evidenced by buildup of a 444-nm ferrous-CO species after the reaction was given CO gas. 5When the H4B- and Arg-free enzyme was reduced with dithionite, 95% of its heme formed a 444-nm complex with CO (data not shown). The residual peak at 420 nm in the inset to Fig.4 therefore represents ferric low spin nNOS. This likely is the monomer that is present when nNOS is purified in the absence of Arg and H4B, whose heme cannot accept NADPH-derived electrons. As expected, the spectrum taken of the substrate- and H4B-free enzyme during steady state NADPH oxidation showed no evidence for buildup of a six-coordinate ferric or ferrous heme-NO complex, which display Soret absorbance bands at 436 and 440 nm, respectively (32Wang J. Rousseau D.L. Abu-Soud H.M. Stuehr D.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 10512-10516Crossref PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar). In the presence of Arg or NOHA (Fig. 4, panels B andC), the heme Soret band of the initial H4B-free ferric nNOS was broader with maximum at 398 nm, consistent with substrate binding and greater high spin character (31Roman L.J. Sheta E.A. Martasek P. Gross S.S. Lin Q. Masters B.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 8428-8432Crossref PubMed Scopus (244) Google Scholar). The spectra recorded just after initiating steady-state oxidation of Arg or NOHA showed a small buildup of heme-NO complex in both cases (data not shown). The proportion of this species grew over time as the O2 was consumed in the cuvette. Spectra taken at 10 min (Fig. 4, panels B and C) clearly show the presence of six-coordinate ferrous-NO complex in the Arg and NOHA reactions, as evidenced by the shoulder near 436 nm and single broad absorbance peak near 570 nm (32Wang J. Rousseau D.L. Abu-Soud H.M. Stuehr D.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 10512-10516Crossref PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar). The nature of the heme-NO species is further defined by the difference spectra in panels B andC, which show absorbance maxima at 436 and 570 nm. Together, our results suggest that the immediate inorganic product of Arg or NOHA oxidation is nitroxide (NO−), which binds to the ferric heme to form a ferrous heme-NO complex. We next examined the kinetics of ferrous-NO complex formation in the H4B-free nNOS and its effect on the NADPH oxidation rate. Theleft panels of Fig.5 depict ferrous-NO complex formation during the initial phase of Arg or NOHA oxidation at 15 °C. The reactions were started by rapid mixing a solution of Ca2+with a solution containing CaM, nNOS, substrate, EDTA, and excess NADPH. In both cases, the absorbance increase at 436 nm was best fit to a two-exponential equation, giving apparent rate constants that are listed in Table II. These values indicate that heme-NO complex formation was biphasic and had the same kinetics whether Arg or NOHA serve as substrate in the H4B-free enzyme. The rates obtained for the H4B-free nNOS are similar to the kinetics of heme-NO complex buildup in H4B-saturated nNOS (33Abu-Soud H.M. Wang J. Rousseau D.L. Fukuto J. Ignarro L.J. Stuehr D.J. J.

Chem. 2000; 275: 17434-17439Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar), but differ in two ways. First is the magnitude of absorbance gain at 436, which when normalized on a per heme basis indicate that the proportion of enzyme that forms the heme-NO complex during Arg or NOHA oxidation is small for H4B-free nNOS (approximately 10%) compared with H4B-saturated nNOS (approximately 70%; Ref. 33Abu-Soud H.M.

Second, the relative absorbance change due to the fast phase of complex buildup in the H4B-free enzyme differs from the H4B-saturated enzyme (33Abu-Soud H.M. Wang J. Rousseau D.L. Fukuto J.

https://openalex.org/W1977552539,"In thioredoxin reductase (TrxR) from Escherichia coli, cycles of reduction and reoxidation of the flavin adenine dinucleotide (FAD) cofactor depend on rate-limiting rearrangements of the FAD and NADPH (reduced form of nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate) domains. We describe the structure of the flavin-reducing conformation of E. coli TrxR at a resolution of 3.0 angstroms. The orientation of the two domains permits reduction of FAD by NADPH and oxidation of the enzyme dithiol by the protein substrate, thioredoxin. The alternate conformation, described by Kuriyan and co-workers, permits internal transfer of reducing equivalents from reduced FAD to the active-site disulfide. Comparison of these structures demonstrates that switching between the two conformations involves a ""ball-and-socket"" motion in which the pyridine nucleotide-binding domain rotates by 67 degrees."

Dislocation models of the surface deformation adjacent to the Hayward fault measured with the global positioning system and interferometric synthetic aperture radar favor creep at approximately 7 millimeters per year to the bottom of the seismogenic zone along a approximately 20-kilometer-long northern fault segment. Microearthquakes with the same waveform repeatedly occur at 4- to 10-kilometer depths and indicate deep creep at 5 to 7 millimeters per year. The difference between current creep rates and the long-term slip rate of approximately 10 millimeters per year can be reconciled in a mechanical model of a freely slipping northern Hayward fault adjacent to the locked 1868 earthquake rupture, which broke the southern 40 to 50 kilometers of the fault. The potential for a major independent earthquake of the northern Hayward fault might be less than previously thought."

Academic Press, Inc., New York1993: 71-116Crossref Google Scholar). The COOH-terminal portion of the enzyme contains a dsRNA-binding domain, which has been found exclusively in proteins recognizing dsRNA. NMR methods have suggested that the dsRNA-binding domain has an α-β-β-β-α topology in which a three-stranded anti-parallel β-sheet packs on one side against the two α-helices (3Kharrat A. Macias M.J. Gibson T.J. Nilges M. Pastore A. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 3572-3584Crossref PubMed Scopus (246) Google Scholar). The enzyme also contains a catalytic domain independent from substrate-binding domain, which implies that substrate recognition is not necessarily coupled to catalysis. All RNase III species cloned to date contain a signature sequence (HNERLEFLGDS). In some species like Drosophila andCaenorhabditis elegans the enzyme contains 2 copies of the sequence (4Filippov V. Solovyev V. Filippova M. Gill S.S. Gene ( Amst. ). 2000; 245: 213-221Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar) which may suggest that some RNase IIIs may be capable of forming an active catalytic center as monomers. Deletion and mutation of this sequence abolishes the catalytic activity of the enzyme (5Nashimoto H. Uchida H. Mol. Gen.

In Escherichia coli, RNase III forms a homodimer (7Dunn J.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1976; 251: 3807-3814Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and requires a divalent metal ion. The enzyme produces 5′-phosphate, 3′-hydroxy termini and participates in RNA maturation and decay pathways by site specifically cleaving double-helical structures in cellular and viral RNAs. By comparing RNase III substrates, Zhang and Nicholson (8Zhang K. Nicholson A.W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 13437-13441Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar) showed several specific Watson-Crick base pairs at defined positions relative to the cleavage site. Introducing these disfavored base pairs into a model substrate inhibited efficient cleavage in vitro by interfering with RNase III binding. By comparing sequences of a large number of S. cerevisiae RNase III substrates and introducing mutations in the model substrate, Chanfreau et al. (9Chanfreau G. Buckle M. Jacquier A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 3142-3147Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar) suggested that yeast RNase III cleavage specificity may be based on recognizing consensus AGNN tetraloops and cleaving the substrate at a fixed distance from the tatraloop. Multiple functions have been ascribed to RNase III. In E. coli RNase III has been reported to affect the expression of several phage, plasmid, and cellular genes (6Nicholson A.W. Prog. Nucleic Acids Res. Mol. Biol. 1996; 52: 1-65Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 10Arraiano C.M. World J. Microbiol. Biotechnol. 1993; 9: 421-432Crossref PubMed Scopus (7) Google Scholar). The E. coli enzyme participates in the rRNA maturation process by processing 16 S and 23 S from the primary 30 S precursor (6Nicholson A.W. Prog. Nucleic Acids Res. Mol. Biol. 1996; 52: 1-65Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). RNase III also plays a determinant role in control of the decay of messenger RNA and thus the level of corresponding proteins (2Court D. Belasco J. Brawerman G. Control of Messenger RNA Stability. Academic Press, Inc., New York1993: 71-116Crossref Google Scholar, 11Santos J.M. Drider D. Marujo P.E. Lopez P. Arraiano C.M. FEMS Microbiol. Lett. 1997; 157: 31-38Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In yeast, it has been suggested that RNase III is a general factor in small nuclear RNA processing since enzyme cleavage sites were identified in several small nuclear RNA species (U1, U2, and U5).

Yeast RNase III (RNT1) is also required for the synthesis of several small nucleolar RNAs from large precursors (18Chanfreau G. Rotondo G. Legrain P. Jacquier A. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 3726-3737Crossref PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar, 19Qu L.H. Henras A. Lu Y.J. Zhou H. Zhou W.X. Zhu Y.Q. Zhao J. Henry Y. Caizergues-Ferrer M. Bachellerie J.P. Mol. Cell.

Additionally, RNase III mutants of E. coli accumulate unprocessed pre-rRNA but are still viable because an alternative pathway for the processing of 16 S rRNA exists, and 23 S rRNA retaining unprocessed extensions at its 5′ and 3′ ends can assemble into functional ribosomes (25Gegenheimer P. Watson N. Apirion D. J. Biol. Chem. 1977; 252: 3064-3073Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). On the other hand, the yeast RNase III (RNT1) is an essential gene in Saccharomyces cerevisiae. To date, human RNase III has not been cloned. We now report the cloning and characterization of a cDNA that expresses a human RNase III. We demonstrate that the human enzyme is distinctly different from the homologues in other species and is involved in pre-rRNA processing. An internet search of the XREF data base in the National Center of Biotechnology Information (NCBI) yielded a 393-base pair human expressed sequenced tag (GeneBank accession numberAA083888) homologous to yeast RNase III (RNT1, GeneBank accession number U27016) and its C. elegans RNase III homolog (accession number Z81070). The first set of three oligonucleotide primers (NIII-2, NIII-4, and NIII-6) corresponding to the human expressed tag sequence sequence was synthesized (Fig. 1 A). By 3′ RACE (rapid amplification of 3′ cDNA), the human RNase III cDNA 3′ from the expressed tag sequence was amplified by polymerase chain reaction, using human liver Marathon ready cDNA (CLONTECH, Polo Alto, CA) as templates, and NIII-2/AP1 (for the first amplification) and NIII-4/AP2 (for the second amplification) as primers (Fig. 1 A). The standard polymerase chain reaction procedure was performed using native pfu DNA polymerase (Stratagene, San Diego, CA) and its reaction buffer. The annealing temperature range was 55–60 °C. The elongation time was approximately 6–8 min. The fragments were subjected to agarose gel electrophoresis in the TAE buffer, denatured in 0.5 m NaOH and then electronically transferred to a nitrocellulose membrane (Bio-Rad) for confirmation by Southern blot. Southern blots were performed using 32P-end labeled NIII-6 oligonucleotide as a probe in hybridization buffer (6 × SSC, 5 × Denhardt's solution) containing 100 μg/ml sheared denatured salmon sperm DNA, 0.5% SDS, 10 mm EDTA at 46 °C for 4 h, then washed twice with 1 × SSC and 0.1% SDS at 42–59 °C for 20 min. The confirmed fragments were excised from the agarose gel and purified by gel extraction (Qiagen, Germany), then subcloned into a zero-blunt vector (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA) and subjected to DNA sequencing. A human liver cDNA λ phage Uni-ZAP library (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA) was screened using the RACE products as specific probes. The positive cDNA clones were excised into pBluescript phagemid from λ phage and subjected to DNA sequencing. Sequencing of the positive clones was performed with an automatic DNA sequencer by Retrogen Inc. (San Diego, CA). Since the cDNA clones from the first run of the screening library were not long enough to encompass the full-length of human RNase III sequence, several sets of oligonucleotide primers based on the information from the cloned cDNA fragments were synthesized. Using these primers, several runs of 5′ RACE were performed to clone three overlapping cDNAs, which resulted in full-length of cDNA (Fig. 1, A and B). The overlapping sequences were aligned and combined by the assembling program of MacDNASISv3.0 (Hitachi Software Engineering Co., America, Ltd.). Protein structure and analysis were performed by the program MacVector v6.0 (Oxford Molecular Group, United Kingdom). A homology search was performed on the NCBI data base through the internet. An SR domain peptide (H-CRSDYDRGRTPSRHRSYERS-OH, amino acids 266–284) and an RNase III domain peptide (H-CRWEREHQEREPDETEDIKK-OH, amino acids 1356–1374) (Fig.1 C) were synthesized, purified (>90% pure), and conjugated to diphtheria toxoid with maleimidocaproyl-N-hydroxysuccinimide and used to raise polyclonal antibodies in rabbits. Anti-SR and anti-III peptide IgGs were affinity purified with SR and III peptides coupled to thiopropyl-Sepharose 6B, respectively (26Harlow E. Lane D. Antibodies : A Laboratory Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1988Google Scholar). Nuclear and non-nuclear fractions from HeLa cells were prepared as described (27Dignam J.D. Lebovitz R.M. Roeder R.G. Nucleic Acids Res. 1983; 11: 1475-1489Crossref PubMed Scopus (9164) Google Scholar). Whole cell, non-nuclear, and nuclear fractions were boiled in SDS sample buffer. Then the samples were separated by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis using 4–20% Tris glycine gels (NOVEX, San Diego, CA) under reducing conditions. Molecular weight prestained markers were used (NOVEX) to determine the protein sizes. The proteins were electrophoretically transferred to a polyvinylidene difluoride membrane and processed for immunoblotting using affinity purified anti-SR or anti-III peptide antibody at 5 μg/ml. The immunoreactive bands were visualized using the enhanced chemiluminescence method (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) and analyzed using PhosphorImager Storm 860 (Molecular Dynamics, Sunnyvale, CA). A cDNA fragment encoding the human RNase III-like domain (COOH-terminal 466 amino acids) was amplified by polymerase chain reaction and introduced into a BamHI site upstream andNotI site downstream. This fragment was further subcloned into the sites of the expression vector pGEX-4T-1 (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) to produce the RNase III fusion protein with glutathioneS-transferase (GST) at its NH2 terminus. The identity of the construct was proven by DNA sequencing. The GST-RNase III fusion protein was expressed in E. coli strain BL21 and purified using glutathione-agarose (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) under native conditions with B-PER bacterial protein extraction reagent (Pierce, Rockford, IL). Control GST protein was also prepared in parallel from the pGEX-4T-1 plasmid. The purified products were identified by Coomassie staining after 12% SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and Western blot analyses with anti-RNase III peptide antibody (see above). The dsRNA substrate was generated by hybridization of two complementary strands of RNA produced with T7 and T3 polymerase transcription of the polylinker region of the pBluescript II KS(−) plasmid (Stratagene, San Diego, CA). The plasmid was digested with either SstI or KpnI and further purified with phenol/chloroform extraction and ethanol precipitation. The SstI- or KpnI-digested plasmids were then transcribed using T7 or T3 RNA polymerase, respectively (Stratagene, San Diego, CA), with or without [α-32P]UTP. The resulting transcribed RNAs (about 100 nucleotides) were purified by electrophoresis on 6% denaturing polyacrylamide gel. The32P-radiolabeled T7 transcript and unlabeled T3 transcript fragments were mixed and heated for 5 min at 90 °C in a buffer containing 20 mm KCl, 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 0.1 mm EDTA. MgCl, bovine serum albumin, and RNase inhibitor were added to the mixture after heating (final concentrations were 10 mm, 100 ng/ml, and 10 units/ml, respectively). The mixture was incubated at 37 °C for 2 h and the duplex RNA was purified on 6% non-denaturing gels. The 32P-labeled T7 transcript was also used as the ssRNA control substrate. To evaluate cleavage, 0.4 μg of GST protein or GST-RNase III (approximately 5–10 pmol of purified GST-RNase III) fusion protein were incubated with labeled dsRNA (250,000 cpm) (approximately 5–10 fmol) and ssRNA (250,000 cpm) at 37 °C in a buffer containing 20 mm KCl, 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 5 mm MgCl, 50 mm NaCl, 0.1 mm dithiothreitol, 0.1 mg/ml yeast tRNA, and 10 units/ml RNase inhibitor in the total volume of 60 μl. The digested samples were quenched at specific times and analyzed using nondenaturing polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and PhosphorImager analysis. HeLa cells were cultured in chamber slides for immunostaining. Cells were washed once with d-PBS (pH 7.0), and then fixed in 10% neutral-buffered formalin for 10 min followed by washing three times with d-pbs. Fixed cells were then blocked for 30 min with 20% fetal bovine serum plus 0.5% Tween 20. Cells were first stained with anti-III or anti-SR peptide antibody (10 μg/ml) for 1 h at 37 °C, washed three times with d-PBS plus 0.1% Nonidet P-40, and incubated for 1 h at 37 °C with the fluorescein isothiocyanate goat anti-rabbit IgG (Jackson ImmunoResearch Laboratory, Inc., West Grove, PA). The cells were washed with d-PBS three times and mounted in mounting medium (Vector, Burlingame, CA) for examination under a fluorescence microscope. HeLa cells were synchronized at early-S phase using the double thymidine method (28Johnson R.T. Downes C.S. Meyn R.E. Fantes P. Brooks R. The Cell Cycle: A Practical Approach. IRL Press, New York1993: 1-24Google Scholar). Briefly, cells were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 10% fetal calf serum and 2 mm thymidine for 17 h. After washing twice with d-pbs, cells were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 10% fetal calf serum for 9 h followed by a second thymidine treatment for 15 h. Synchronized cells were then washed twice with d-pbs, cultured, and harvested at 0, 2, 4, 6, 8, and 24 h for immunofluorescence staining and FACS analysis. HeLa cells were detached from culture flasks with trypsin-EDTA and washed once with d-pbs containing 5 mm EDTA. Cells were then fixed in 70% ethanol for 1–24 h at 4 °C followed by propidium iodine (50 μg/ml) staining for 1 h at room temperature. Cell counts and propidium iodine contents were determined by FACS analysis (Becton Dickinson and Co., San Jose, CA). 2′-Methoxyethyl chimeric phosphorothioate oligonucleotides (Table I) were synthesized and purified as described previously (29McKay R.A. Miraglia L.J. Cummins L.L. Owens S.R. Sasmor H. Dean N.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 1715-1722Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (214) Google Scholar). They were >85% pure. HeLa cells were transfected with oligonucleotides mixed with Lipofectin (Life Technologies, Inc., Gaithersburg, MD) at various concentrations for 5 h at 37 °C in serum-free Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium. After removing the oligonucleotide containing medium, cells were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 10% fetal calf serum for another 0 to 67 h and harvested for analysis.Table ISequences, mRNA target sites and effects of antisense oligonucleotides designed to bind to human RNase III mRNABold letters in sequences represent 2′-MOE nucleotides; others are deoxynucleotides.

Total RNA was isolated from different human cell lines (ATCC, Rockville, MD) using the guanidine isothiocyanate method (30Kingston R.E. Ausubel F.M. Brent R. Kingston R.E. Moore D.D. Seidman J.G. Smith J.A. Struhl K. Current Protocols in Molecular Biology. 1. John Wiley & Sons Inc., New York1997: 4.2.3-4.2.5Google Scholar). Fifteen μg of total RNA was separated on a 1.2% agarose/formaldehyde gel and transferred to Hybond-N+ (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) followed by fixing using UV cross-linker (Strategene, La Jolla, CA). The premade multiple tissue Northern blots were also purchased from CLONTECH (Polo Alto, CA). To detect RNase III mRNA, hybridization was performed by using32P-labeled human RNase III cDNA probe (1.4 kb, clone 3-1) in Quik-Hyb buffer (Strategene, La Jolla, CA) at 68 °C for 2 h. After hybridization, membranes were washed in a final stringency of 0.1 × SSC, 0.1% SDS at 60 °C for 30 min. To detect pre-rRNA and rRNA, hybridization was performed by using32P-end labeled oligo probes 5′ETS-1 (5′-CAAGGCACGCCTCTCAGATCGCTAGAGAAGGCTTTTCTCA-3′), corresponded to 5′ETS and 5.8S-1 (5′-CATTAATTCTCGCAGCTAGCGCTGCGTTCTTCATCGACGC-3′), corresponded to 5.8 S rRNA at 40 °C for 2 h and washed in 2 × SSC, 0.1% SDS at 40 °C for 1 h. Membranes were analyzed using PhosphorImager Storm 860 (Molecular Dynamics, Sunnyvale, CA). The cloning strategy is described in detail under “Materials and Methods” and in the legend to Fig. 1. Using primers based on a search of the XREF data base, an approximate 1.2-kb cDNA (clone U4) corresponding to the COOH-terminal portion of the protein was cloned by 3′ RACE. Eight positive clones were isolated by screening a liver cDNA library with this clone. The two longest clones, 3-1 and 3-4, correspond to the COOH-terminal region, 2636–3912 and 3350–4764 base pairs, respectively, of the full-length cDNA. With primers (3RACE1, 3RACE2, and 3RACE3) based on the NH2-terminal portion of the clone 3-4, 5′ RACE was performed to clone a cDNA (clone L40) of approximately 1 kb, which encodes the middle part of the full-length cDNA. In the same way, a cDNA (clone 25) of the NH2-terminal portion was cloned. Using clone 25 to screen the liver library again, several clones were isolated, but none of these included additional NH2-terminal sequence. The most NH2-terminal clone is 328, which corresponds the sequence 799–2191 base pairs. So the last 5′ RACE was performed with the primers (33G, 33H, and 33 Dec based on clone 25) and the NH2-terminal portion of the cDNA (clone 81) was generated. These overlapping clones were sequenced and assembled to a full-length human RNase III cDNA with the total of 4764 nucleotides (Fig.1 B, GenBank accession number AF189011). The cDNA contained a coding sequence of 4125 (from 246 to 4370) nucleotides that encodes a 1374-amino acid protein. The calculated molecular mass of the protein is 160 kDa based on the prediction of the first methionine as the translation initiation site. The proposed initiation codon is in reasonable agreement with the mammalian translation initiation consensus sequence (Kozak sequence) (31Kozak M. J. Cell Biol. 1989; 108: 229-241Crossref PubMed Scopus (2810) Google Scholar). Northern hybridization analyses using clone 3-1 (Fig. 1 B, 3′ portion of cDNA) demonstrated that the human RNase III mRNA was approximately 5 kb. It was ubiquitously expressed in human tissues and cell lines (Fig.2). When clone 25 (Fig. 1, 5 portion of cDNA) was used to probe Northerns, equivalent results were obtained (data not shown). Compared with C. elegans, yeast, and bacterial RNase III, the full-length of human RNase III clone is substantially larger and contains multiple domains (Fig.1 C). The RNase III domain (approximately 426 amino acids) is located at the carboxyl terminus of the protein and is well conserved with other species such as C. elegans, yeast, and bacterial RNase III. This domain shares strong homology with C. elegans RNase III (41% amino acid identity, Fig. 1 D). Both the human RNase III domain and C. elegans RNase III contain two RNase III signature sequences. The human RNase III domain also contains multiple potential phosphorylation sites. The full-length human protein also contains proline-rich (220 amino acids) and SR-rich (250 amino acids) domains near the amino terminus (Fig. 1 C). The SR and RNase III domains are separated by the 478-amino acid region.Figure 2Northern blot analysis of expression of human RNase III. A, top, a Northern blot containing 15 μg of total RNA of human cell lines were hybridized with human RNase III COOH-terminal cDNA (clone 3-1) probe. Bottom, the blot was rehybridized with a glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (G3PDH) cDNA probe. B, top, a Northern blot containing 2 μg of poly(A)+ RNA extracted from human tissues was hybridized with cDNA clone 3-1 probe.Bottom, the blot was rehybridized with G3PDH cDNA probe.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) To test whether the human RNase III domain can specifically cleave dsRNA, the RNase III domain-coding region was subcloned into a glutathioneS-transferase (GST) expression vector. The GST-RNase III fusion protein and GST alone were expressed, purified using glutathione-agarose, and analyzed by Coomassie Blue staining of the SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and Western blot analysis with anti-human RNase III peptide antibody (data not shown). These studies showed that the human RNase III domain was greater than 85% pure. However, there was evidence of slight degradation during expression and purification. When incubated with labeled dsRNA and ssRNA, the GST-RNase III fusion protein preferentially digested the dsRNA without significant cleavage of ssRNA, while GST alone cleaved neither dsRNA nor single-stranded DNA substrate (Fig. 1 E). Thus, the cleavage observed was not due to contamination with ssRNases or dsRNases from E. coli. Ribonucleases V1(dsRNase), and T1 and A (ssRNases) were used as controls to confirm that the cleavage observed was dsRNA cleavage (data not shown). As described under “Materials and Methods,” we incubated approximately 5–10 pmol of GST-RNase III domain with 5–10 fmol of dsRNA. Thus, the GST-human RNase III domain was perhaps 5–10-fold less active than the reported activity for yeast RNase III (23Elela S.A. Igel H. Ares Jr., M. Cell. 1996; 85: 115-124Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (192) Google Scholar). However, the purification and reaction conditions and the substrate have not been optimized, and only the GST RNase III domain has been studied. Clearly, much more work is required with the full-length human enzyme before comparisons of the specific activities of the enzymes are possible. To determine the expression of the human RNase III protein, two anti-peptide antibodies were produced. The anti-III peptide antibody was derived from a peptide (amino acids 1356–1374) corresponding to the RNase III domain present in the COOH-terminal portion of the putative protein. The anti-SR peptide antibody was derived from a peptide (amino acids 266–284) corresponding to the SR-rich domain of the putative protein (Fig.1 C). Using these antibodies, Western blot analyses were performed to determine the size and localization of human RNase III. The anti-SR peptide antibody recognized a band in HeLa whole cell lysate with a size of approximately 160 kDa (Fig.3 A) which is near the calculated protein size confirming that the full coding region is expressed in HeLa cells. The anti-RNase III peptide antibody also recognized a 160-kDa protein in HeLa cells and that protein comigrated with the protein identified with the anti-SR domain antibody (data not shown). Similar experiments were performed using different human cell lines e.g. A549, T24, and HL60 with equivalent results (data not shown). To further confirm that the predicted protein is indeed expressed in human cells, the protein was partially purified with an RNase III domain peptide antibody column. The purified protein was then recognized on Western blots by both antibodies (data not shown). To determine the localization of the protein, nuclear and non-nuclear fractions from HeLa cells (Fig. 3 A) and other human cell lines (data not shown) were prepared and equal amounts of proteins (40 μg) were analyzed by Western blots. RNase III was present primarily in the nuclear fractions (Fig. 3 A). Non-nuclear fractions contained only trace amounts of protein, possibly due to the contamination during sample preparation. The anti-III peptide antibody gave results equivalent to those obtained with the anti-SR peptide antibody (data not shown). To better understand the localization of human RNase III, the protein was identified in cells by indirect immunofluorescence microscopy. The nuclei of HeLa cells were stained by both anti-SR (data not shown) and anti-III (Fig. 3 B) antibodies, confirming that human RNase III is present in the nucleus. Fig. 3 B also shows that RNase III is localized extensively in nucleus and occasionally observed in nucleoli. Double thymidine treatment was used to synchronize HeLa cells to early-S phase (Fig. 4) (28Johnson R.T. Downes C.S. Meyn R.E. Fantes P. Brooks R. The Cell Cycle: A Practical Approach. IRL Press, New York1993: 1-24Google Scholar). Two to four hours after releasing the thymidine block, HeLa cells entered S phase. Six to eight hours after releasing, HeLa cells entered the G2/M phase. There were no significant changes in the mRNA or protein levels"

C3carboxylation to oxaloacetate can originate from phosphoenolpyruvate and pyruvate, and at the same time multiple C4-decarboxylating enzymes may be present. The functions of such parallel reactions are not yet fully understood. Using a13C NMR-based strategy, we here quantify the individual fluxes at the anaplerotic node of Corynebacterium glutamicum, which is an example of a bacterium possessing multiple carboxylation and decarboxylation reactions. C. glutamicum was grown with a 13C-labeled glucose isotopomer mixture as the main carbon source and13C-labeled lactate as a cosubstrate. 58 isotopomers as well as 15 positional labels of biomass compounds were quantified. Applying a generally applicable mathematical model to include metabolite mass and carbon labeling balances, it is shown that pyruvate carboxylase contributed 91 ± 7% to C3 carboxylation. The total in vivo carboxylation rate of 1.28 ± 0.14 mmol/g dry weight/h exceeds the demand of carboxylated metabolites for biosyntheses 3-fold.

These carboxylation and decarboxylation reactions are catalyzed by a number of enzymes (1Kornberg H.L. Campbell P.N. Grevile G.D. Essays in Biochemistry. II. Academic Press, Inc., New York1966Google Scholar, 2Stryer L. Biochemistry. 3rd Ed. W. H. Freeman Co., New York1988Google Scholar). Synthesis of oxaloacetate via carboxylation of C3 metabolites may be catalyzed by phosphoenolpyruvate (PEP)1 carboxylase, PEP carboxytransphosphorylase, or pyruvate carboxylase. The reverse reaction, decarboxylation of oxaloacetate, may analogously lead to PEP or pyruvate, catalyzed by PEP carboxykinase or oxaloacetate decarboxylase, respectively. NAD+- or NADP+-dependent malic enzyme catalyzes the reaction from malate to pyruvate. In some organisms, this enzyme is also thought to act in a pyruvate-carboxylating sense (3Sundqvist K.E. Hiltunen J.K. Hassinen I.E. Biochem. J. 1989; 257: 913-916Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). To date, a full understanding of these enzymatic reactions and their functions has been hindered by a lack of knowledge about their activities in vivo. The occurrence of parallel reactions and the involvement of a set of metabolites in activity control of the enzymes prevents reliable estimations on the actual enzyme use. Moreover, it is not possible to derive quantitative data on in vivo flux rates by enzyme characterizations alone. Instead, carbon-13 labeling techniques, which employed NMR spectroscopy (for an overview, see e.g. Refs. 4Jeffrey F.M.H. Rajagopal A. Malloy C.R. Sherry A.D. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1991; 16: 5-10Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar and 5Wiechert W. de Graaf A.A. Scheper T. Advances in Biochemical Engineering Biotechnology. 54. Springer-Verlag, Berlin1996Google Scholar) or mass spectrometry, as well as carbon-14 radiolabeling methods have been used to quantifyin vivo intracellular fluxes in central metabolism including conversions between PEP, pyruvate, and oxaloacetate/malate. However, although these studies quantified the total C3carboxylation and C4 decarboxylation rates, they either investigated cases in which only a single flux in each direction had to be considered (e.g. 6–10), in which parallel reactions were lumped together (11Marx A. de Graaf A.A. Wiechert W. Eggeling L Sahm H. Biotechnol. Bioeng. 1996; 49: 111-129Crossref PubMed Scopus (347) Google Scholar, 12Jucker B.M. Lee J.Y. Shulman R.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 12187-12194Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar), or in which the resolution of parallel reactions required assumptions on compartmentation (13Rabkin M. Blum J.J. Biochem. J. 1985; 225: 761-786Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar, 14Baranyai J.M. Blum J.J. Biochem. J. 1989; 258: 121-140Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). For the parallel decarboxylating reactions in Bacillus subtilis, it was possible to derive separate upper bounds (15Sauer U. Hatzimanikatis V. Bailey J.E. Hochuli M. Szyperski T. Wüthrich K. Nat. Biotechnol. 1997; 15: 448-452Crossref PubMed Scopus (215) Google Scholar). One study estimated the relative carboxylation fluxes originating from PEP and pyruvate inCorynebacterium glutamicum based on comparison of deletion mutants (16Park S.M. Shaw-Reid C. Sinskey A.J. Stephanopoulos G. Appl. Microbiol. Biotechnol. 1997; 47: 430-440Crossref Scopus (60) Google Scholar), an approach that, however, by itself does not represent the natural situation, since fluxes are severely disturbed in mutants and the cell may react very flexibly (17Marx A. Striegel K. de Graaf A.A. Sahm H. Eggeling L. Biotechnol. Bioeng. 1997; 56: 168-180Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar, 18Marx A. Eikmanns B.J. Sahm H. de Graaf A.A. Eggeling L. Metab. Eng. 1999; 1: 35-48Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar). In this study, we present and apply a strategy for the resolution of the bidirectional as well as multiply parallel enzymatic conversions within anaplerosis that is generally applicable to a variety of biological systems. The experimental approach is based on13C labeling techniques and NMR spectroscopy and makes full use of the recently found explicit mathematical solution of isotopomer balances (19Wiechert W. Möllney M. Isermann N. Wurzel M. de Graaf A.A. Biotechnol. Bioeng. 1999; 66: 69-85Crossref PubMed Scopus (235) Google Scholar) and the accompanying experimental design framework (20Möllney M. Wiechert W. Kownatzki D. de Graaf A.A. Biotechnol. Bioeng. 1999; 66: 86-103Crossref PubMed Scopus (167) Google Scholar). The procedure was applied to C. glutamicum, since this organism possesses PEP and pyruvate carboxylases, PEP carboxykinase, oxaloacetate decarboxylase, and NADP+-dependent malic enzyme, which are all shown to be active in vitro(21Shiio I.

C. glutamicum wild type ATCC 13032 was pregrown overnight in 100 ml of 3.7% brain-heart-glucose bouillon (Difco), washed twice with buffer of 50 mm Tris·HCl and 50 mm NaCl, pH set to 6.8 using NaOH, and inoculated into the bioreactor containing unlabeled medium to result in an optical density at 600 nm (A 600) of approximately 1.1. Cultivation was carried out in a KLF2000 bioreactor (Bioengineering, Wald, Switzerland) equipped with an automatic medium feeding system YFC 01Z (Sartorius, Göttingen, Germany) and a COI online exhaust gas13CO2/12CO2 monitor (Fischer Analysen Instrumente, Leipzig, Germany). The medium was based on an optimization described (31Weuster-Botz D. Kelle R. Frantzen M. Wandrey C. Biotechnol. Prog. 1997; 13: 387-393Crossref Scopus (32) Google Scholar) and consisted of 10 g/liter (NH4)2SO4, 0.5 g/liter K2HPO4, 0.5 g/liter KH2PO4, 0.5 g/liter NaCl, 0.285 g/liter MgSO4·7H2O, 0.05 g/liter CaCl2·2H2O, 28.5 mg/liter FeSO4·7H2O, 11.2 mg/liter MnSO4·H2O, 763 μg/liter CuSO4·5H2O, 6.3 mg/liter ZnSO4·7H2O, 130 μg/liter CoCl2·6H2O, 43 μg/liter NiCl2·6H2O, 65 μg/liter Na2MoO4·2 H2O, 28 μg/liter AlK(SO4)2·12H2O, 20 μg/liter Na2SeO3·5H2O, 50 μg/liter H3BO3, 0.85 mg/liter biotin, 0.1 g/liter EDTA·2Na·2H2O, and 0.02% polypropylene glycol P1200 as antifoam agent. The medium was supplemented with either unlabeled carbon sources (21 mm glucose and 4 mmsodium-l-lactate) or a mixture of isotopically enriched substrates containing 4.2 mm [1-13C]glucose and 2.1 mm [13C6]glucose (both from Cambridge Isotope Laboratories, Andover, MA), 14.7 mmunlabeled glucose, and 4 mm sodiuml-[3-13C]lactate (Euriso-top, Gif-sur-Yvette, France). This optimal isotopomeric substrate composition was evaluated by computer simulations using the metabolic flux model described below and the experimental design procedures outlined in Ref. 20Möllney M. Wiechert W. Kownatzki D. de Graaf A.A. Biotechnol. Bioeng. 1999; 66: 86-103Crossref PubMed Scopus (167) Google Scholar. Culture pH was automatically maintained at 6.8 by a dosage of 2n NaOH. The culture volume was controlled at 600 ml by weight measurement and culture broth withdrawal. Peristaltic pumps were used for all liquid flows. Cultivation temperature was 30 °C. Aeration was achieved by synthetic air (80% N2 and 20% O2) at a flow rate of 46 liter/h and 1200 rpm stirrer speed. The oxygen partial pressure was measured but not controlled. Five hours after inoculation of the bioreactor, the carbon source was consumed, as could be monitored via respiration activity, and the continuous chemostat mode was started with a dilution rate of 0.1 h−1, i.e. 60 ml/h feed of unlabeled medium. At a cultivation time of 55 h, the respiration activity and A 600 was stabilized and remained constant for an additional 42 h. Oxygen partial pressure was constant at approximately 80% of air saturation. Metabolic steady-state conditions thus established, the unlabeled feed was replaced by labeled medium as described above. After 29 h of subsequent cultivation, the biomass was harvested, washed twice, and freeze-dried. The optical density (A 600) of culture samples was measured on a UV 160A spectrophotometer (Shimadzu, Tokyo, Japan). Samples were diluted to a resulting A 600 between 0.1 and 0.3 prior to measurements. Culture supernatants were analyzed for glucose,l-lactate, and ammonia using enzymatic test kits (Roche Molecular Biochemicals). Carbon and nitrogen contents of freeze-dried biomass were determined using a CHNS 932 element analyzer (Leco, St. Joseph, MI). Carbon-13 labeling patterns of metabolites isolated from labeled cell material (i.e. not from the cytoplasm) were determined by NMR spectroscopy. To this end, 250 mg of freeze-dried cells was hydrolyzed in 12 ml of 6.0 n HCl for 12 h at 105 °C. One half of the hydrolysate was used for two-dimensional NMR measurements (see below), the other half for fractionation of proteinogenic amino acids by cation exchange chromatography as described previously (11Marx A. de Graaf A.A. Wiechert W. Eggeling L Sahm H. Biotechnol. Bioeng. 1996; 49: 111-129Crossref PubMed Scopus (347) Google Scholar, 32Sonntag K. Eggeling L. de Graaf A.A. Sahm H. Eur. J. Biochem. 1993; 213: 1325-1331Crossref PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar). Amino acid fractions of alanine, aspartate, glutamate, glycine, lysine, phenylalanine, serine, threonine, and valine as well as the remaining cell hydrolysate were each lyophilized, redissolved in 700 μl of deuterium oxide (Deutero, Kastellaun, Germany) containing 2 mm of sodium trimethylsilylpropionate-2,2,3,3-d 4 (Aldrich), and filled into 5-mm NMR sample tubes. All NMR measurements were carried out on a Bruker AMX400-WB spectrometer system at 400.13 MHz for1H and 100.61 MHz for 13C. Isotopomer distributions in amino acids were determined from13C spectra acquired under continuous composite pulse broadband decoupling using a 70° pulse, a sweep width of 26.3 kHz, and a repetition time of 2 s. 25,600 scans of 32,768 complex points were accumulated per spectrum. Fractional 13C enrichments of protonated carbon atoms were determined by proton-13C decoupling difference spectroscopy as previously published (11Marx A. de Graaf A.A. Wiechert W. Eggeling L Sahm H. Biotechnol. Bioeng. 1996; 49: 111-129Crossref PubMed Scopus (347) Google Scholar, 32Sonntag K. Eggeling L. de Graaf A.A. Sahm H. Eur. J.

To access labeling patterns in glycerol, a heteronuclear single-quantum correlated two-dimensional spectrum (34Szyperski T. Eur. J. Biochem. 1995; 232: 433-448Crossref PubMed Scopus (323) Google Scholar) was recorded from the sample containing the complete cell hydrolysate. The acquisition parameters were t 1max = 520 ms,t 2max = 231 ms, data size before zero-filling 3072 points in t 1 and 2048 points int 2. Sweep width was 4.42 kHz for 1H and 2.95 kHz for 13C; the carrier position was 4.8 ppm for1H and 63.1 ppm for 13C. Total recording time was 53.5 h. Fig. 1 depicts the subnetwork of central metabolism relevant for resolution of the anaplerotic fluxes, along with the carbon atom transitions. It essentially comprises the tricarboxylic acid cycle, anaplerotic reactions, and the conversions of triose phosphates via PEP and pyruvate to acetyl coenzyme A. The glyoxylate cycle is not considered, since it is not active during growth of C. glutamicum on glucose as we have shown in previous 13C labeling studies (11Marx A. de Graaf A.A. Wiechert W. Eggeling L Sahm H. Biotechnol. Bioeng. 1996; 49: 111-129Crossref PubMed Scopus (347) Google Scholar, 18Marx A. Eikmanns B.J. Sahm H. de Graaf A.A. Eggeling L. Metab.

Microbiol. 1997; 168: 262-269Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). 13C fractional enrichments and isotopomer distributions of biomass precursors from this part of central metabolism can be determined by NMR measurements of glycerol and the proteinogenic amino acids alanine, aspartate, glutamate, phenylalanine, serine, and threonine from a biomass hydrolysate. Previous experiments employing [1-13C]glucose as the sole labeled substrate enabled a detailed and accurate flux analysis in C. glutamicum but did not allow us to discriminate between PEP- and pyruvate-involving fluxes because fractional enrichments of PEP and pyruvate were found to be identical (11Marx A. de Graaf A.A. Wiechert W. Eggeling L Sahm H. Biotechnol. Bioeng. 1996; 49: 111-129Crossref PubMed Scopus (347) Google Scholar). Therefore, in our present experiment, [3-13C]lactate was used as a labeled cosubstrate to result in a differently labeled pyruvate pool. Furthermore, we additionally used uniformly labeled [13C6]glucose against a background of unlabeled glucose, since this approach allows to estimate the fractions of the PEP and pyruvate pools that originate from oxaloacetate (15Sauer U. Hatzimanikatis V. Bailey J.E. Hochuli M. Szyperski T. Wüthrich K. Nat. Biotechnol. 1997; 15: 448-452Crossref PubMed Scopus (215) Google Scholar,34Szyperski T. Eur. J. Biochem. 1995; 232: 433-448Crossref PubMed Scopus (323) Google Scholar). Thus, in this study, an optimized substrate mixture of the four species [1-13C]glucose, [13C6]glucose, unlabeled glucose, andl-[3-13C]lactate was employed in a single experiment. Extracellular fluxes (i.e. between the cells and the surrounding medium) were determined to normalize the metabolic network and to check the consistency of the cultivation data. From three samples taken during steady state of the culture, the dry weight obtained was 1.86 ± 0.03 g/liter. The remaining concentrations of glucose and lactate were 0.014 ± 0.003 and 0.06 ± 0.01 mm, respectively. Ammonia concentration was 139 ± 1 mm. From these measurements, feed concentrations, and the dilution rate, the specific uptake rates were calculated as 1.13 ± 0.02 mmol of glucose/g dry weight/h, 0.21 ± 0.01 mmol/g/h lactate, and 0.65 ± 0.05 mmol/g/h ammonia. Carbon dioxide concentrations measured in the exhaust gas were 1726 ± 38 ppm of 12CO2 and 292 ± 6 ppm of 13CO2 (molar fractions), corresponding to a specific carbon dioxide production rate of 3.73 ± 0.15 mmol/g/h. Total carbon and nitrogen contents of dry biomass were 41.4 ± 0.6 and 9.7 ± 0.2%, respectively. Except for small amounts of alanine and valine detected by NMR (<0.1 mm, i.e. less than 0.5% of the carbon balance), no other products or compounds (e.g. protein that could indicate cell lysis) were present in the culture supernatant. Hence, the element balances for carbon and nitrogen are closed within the experimental error margins (97 ± 4 and 106 ± 8%, respectively). Fractional enrichments and/or13C spectral fine structures were determined from a total of 24 carbon atoms in the nine purified amino acids listed under “Experimental Procedures.” Moreover, the 13C fine structures of glycerol were evaluated from the two-dimensional spectrum of the cell hydrolysate by means of cross-sections through the maxima of the 13C signals. The metabolic and isotopic steady state labeling data derived from these measurements for the precursor metabolites triose phosphates, PEP, pyruvate, oxaloacetate, and α-ketoglutarate are summarized in TableI, while Fig.2 shows the relevant NMR spectra. In the following, we will show how these data can be used in a simple and intuitive approach employing basic carbon-13 and isotopomer balances to analyze the network depicted in Fig. 1. The results of the comprehensive computer-based flux analysis based on the full set of NMR data, together with the description of the metabolic model used, are given in the . Results of this comprehensive analysis that are relevant for the network of Fig. 1 are included in Table I for comparison.Figure 1Simplified metabolic network and carbon atom transitions used in anaplerotic flux estimation.

See Tables A-II and A-III in the for measurement accuracies. ND, not determinable. As can be seen from Fig. 3 A, fluxes leading to pyruvate originate from PEP (a), the cosubstrate lactate (b), or oxaloacetate/malate (c). For the fractional enrichments in carbon positions 2 and 3 of pyruvate, the label balances at metabolic and isotopic steady state can be set up (Fig. 3 A) as follows, (a+b+c)FEPyr,C­2=a·FEPEP,C­2+b·FELact,C­2+c·FEOAA,C­2Equation 1 (a+b+c)FEPyr,C­3=a·FEPEP,C­3+b·FELact,C­3+c·FEOAA,C­3Equation 2 where FE denotes the fractional enrichments in the specified position (available from measurements (Table I) or known in the case of the substrate lactate, which is fully labeled in C-3 and has natural 13C abundance of 1.1% in the other carbons). Fractional labeling in each of the carbon atoms of pyruvate is therefore linearly dependent on the labels in the respective carbons of three metabolites and their relative fluxes leading into the pyruvate pool. The evaluation of Equations 1 and 2 with the data from Table Iyields relative amounts of 85, 8, and 7% for a,b and c, respectively, as fractions of the total flux into the pyruvate pool. Since flux b, lactate consumption, was measured as 0.21 mmol/g/h, the other two fluxes can be directly assigned absolute values of a = 2.23 mmol/g/h (pyruvate kinase and phosphotransferase system for glucose uptake) andc = 0.18 mmol/g/h (oxaloacetate decarboxylase and/or malic enzyme). Thus, the first finding is that oxaloacetate decarboxylation contributed only little to pyruvate formation. A set of equations analogous to those for the pyruvate node is obtained for the oxaloacetate/malate node (Fig. 3 B), (d+e+f)FEOAA,C­2=Equation 3 d·FEPEP,C­2+e·FEPyr,C­2+f·½(FEαKG,C­3+FEαKG,C­4)(d+e+f)FEOAA,C­3=Equation 4 d·FEPEP,C­3+e·FEPyr,C­3+f·½(FEαKG,C­3+FEαKG,C­4)where d represents PEP carboxylase, erepresents pyruvate carboxylase, and f represents tricarboxylic acid cycle activity, and it is considered that both C-2 and C-3 of tricarboxylic acid cycle-derived oxaloacetate originate with equal probability from C-3 and C-4 of α-ketoglutarate due to label scrambling at the symmetrical molecule of succinate. Since the label in the C-3 position of oxaloacetate is higher than that in C-3 of PEP and 2-oxoglutarate (Fig. 3 B), it can be seen beforehand that oxaloacetate must have a high influx from pyruvate. With both Equations3 and 4, and using the data in Table I, the relative fluxesd, e, and f are evaluated as 13, 47, and 40%, respectively, stating the second major result of the present investigation that the anaplerotic synthesis of oxaloacetate originates from pyruvate rather than PEP. This conclusion is visually perceivable from the 13C spectra of C-3 of phenylalanine, alanine, and aspartate (Fig. 2), which show a high singlet contribution in oxaloacetate-derived aspartate C-3 similar to that in pyruvate-derived alanine C-3 rather than PEP-derived phenylalanine C-3. This illustrates that the supplementation of C-3-labeled lactate as cosubstrate enables the differentiation of PEP and pyruvate as possible origins of oxaloacetate, since the ensuing influx of [3-13C]pyruvate caused the elevated singlet contribution in the C-3 signal of alanine. Thus, our data indicate that pyruvate carboxylase contributed at least 3-fold more to oxaloacetate synthesis than PEP carboxylase in C. glutamicum. The phosphoenolpyruvate node, illustrated in Fig. 3 C, involves PEP synthesis from triose phosphates (g) and by the back reaction from oxaloacetate to PEP (h). To date, no PEP synthase activity has been reported for C. glutamicum; hence, no influx to the PEP pool from pyruvate was considered. Following the amount of intact 13C3 fragments by inspection of the C-2 multiplet structure data of glycerol, phenylalanine, and aspartate (Fig. 2) reveals that a significant back flux from oxaloacetate to phosphoenolpyruvate must have been present. These triply labeled fragments, which appear as characteristic “doublet of doublet” (or as a triplet in the case of glycerol), fine structures in the C-2 NMR signals (Fig. 2), emerge from the portion of fully labeled glucose in the substrate mixture. Their relative amount (Table I), as a fraction of the total 13C signal, is highest in triose phosphates (69.9%) and significantly lower in PEP (60.0%), an observation that can only be explained by an influx to PEP from the pool of oxaloacetate, in which the amount of intact 13C3 fragments is greatly reduced (26.6%) due to the reactions of the tricarboxylic acid cycle. As with the other nodes, a set of labeling equations is set up for the PEP node, now including isotopomers,(g+h)FEPEP,C­2=g·FETriP,C­2+h·FEOAA,C­2Equation 5 (g+h)FEPEP,C­2·FSPEP,C­2=Equation 6 g·FETriP,C­2·FSTriP,C­2+h·FEOAA,C­2·FSOAA,C­2where FS denotes the relative intensity of a fine structure within the 13C signal of the position specified. Hence, the product of FS and the corresponding fractional enrichment (FE) is equal to an isotopomer fraction of a C3 fragment. Using the “doublet of doublets” fine structures (Table I), the evaluation of Equations 5 and 6 yields ag:h flux ratio of 82:18 and an estimate of 11.5% for the fractional label in C-2 of triose phosphates (FE TriP,C-2) that was not measured. Thus, the third important result of this study is that the gluconeogenic enzyme PEP carboxykinase is strongly active in C. glutamicum even during growth on glucose. So far, the relative influx distributions at the three nodes of the network (Fig. 1) have been derived separately. Now, by metabolite balancing, the absolute fluxes can be evaluated. First, a balance is formed for the pyruvate node, a+b+c=e+f+bsPyr+bsAcCoA+bsαKGEquation 7 which takes into account the fact that all carbons leaving the pyruvate pool eventually arrive at oxaloacetate/malate, directly (e) or via the tricarboxylic acid cycle (f), or leave central metabolism as biosynthetic precursors, either directly from pyruvate or via acetyl coenzyme A and α-ketoglutarate, denoted by bs Pyr, bs AcCoA, andbs αKG, respectively. A second balance considers"

Subsequently, heparan polymerases elongate the heparan/heparin chain by conjugating alternately β-GlcUA and α-GlcNAc (7Lind T. Tufaro F. McCormick C. Lindahl U. Lidholt K. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 26265-26268Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (353) Google Scholar). Alternatively, elongation of the chondroitin chain can be initiated by adding GalNAc to the substrate by β-1,4-N-acetylgalactosaminyltransferase I (11Nadanaka S. Kitagawa H. Goto F. Tamura J. Neumann K.W. Ogawa T. Sugahara K. Biochem. J. 1999; 340: 353-357PubMed Google Scholar), followed by alternate conjugations of β-GlcUA and β-GalNAc resulting from the concerted actions of glucuronyltransferase II and β1,4-N-acetylgalactosaminyltransferase II (12Tsuchida K. Lind T. Kitagawa H. Lindahl U. Sugahara K. Lindholt K. Eur. J. Biochem. 1999; 264: 461-467Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar) or chondroitin synthetase (13DeAngelis, P. L., and Padgett-McCue, A. (2000) J. Biol. Chem., in press.Google Scholar). These glycosyltransferases execute catalysis with a high substrate specificity to produce GAGs. To better understand GAG biosynthesis, we have engineered an active domain of human GlcAT-I, expressed as the soluble enzyme in Escherichia coli cells, crystallized in the presence of UDP-GlcUA, and soaked with the acceptor substrate analog Galβ1–3Galβ1–4Xyl. Here we report the ternary structure of GlcAT-1 with both the donor product and the acceptor substrate. The coding region of the catalytic domain of GlcAT-I was amplified from human liver cDNA by polymerase chain reaction. The expressed protein contained the following sequence: MGSSHHHHHHSSGLVPRGSHMT76–V335. Sequence analysis revealed the liver enzyme to differ from the placenta enzyme by one substitution Phe at position 204 instead of Ser. The amplified DNA was inserted into the bacterial expression plasmid PET-28a. The PET-28a plasmid was then transformed into BL21(DE3) cells. To express selenomethionyl GlcAT-I, B834(DE3) cells were used. Expressed protein was purified using Ni2+-agarose and eluted with a gradient of imidazole. The eluted fractions containing GlcAT-1 were pooled, dialyzed against 25 mm HEPES, pH 7.5, and 50 mmNaCl and concentrated to 30.8 mg of protein/ml. For enzyme assay, UDP-[14C]GlcUA (320 mCi/mmol) was obtained from American Radiolabeled Chemicals, Inc. Unlabeled UDP-GlcUA and ATP were obtained from Sigma. The glucuronyltransferase activity was determined as described previously using Galβ1–3Galβ1–4Xyl or asialoorosomucoid (Galβ1–4GlcNAc-R, R representing the remainder of the N-linked oligosaccharide chain) as substrate (14Tone Y. Kitagawa H. Imiya K. Oka S. Kawasaki T. Sugahara K. FEBS Lett. 1999; 459: 415-420Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). The substrate Galβ1–3Galβ1–4Xyl was from Dr. N. B. Schwartz (University of Chicago). Crystals of GlcAT-I were obtained by the vapor diffusion hanging drop method. 4 μl of 15 mg/ml GlcAT-1 in 25 mm HEPES, pH 7.5, 50 mmNaCl, and 4 mm UDP-GlcUA were mixed with 4 μl of the reservoir solution containing 840 mmNaH2PO4, 560 mmK2HPO4, 140 mm LiSO4, and 70 mm CHAPS, pH 6.2. Average crystals grew to the dimensions of 0.5 mm × 0.5 mm × 0.05 mm after 2 weeks. For data collection, crystals were transferred in 4 steps from the crystallization conditions to the cryo-protectant solution of 900 mm NaH2PO4, 600 mmK2HPO4, 150 mm LiSO4, 75 mm CAPS pH 6.2, 4 mm UDP-GlcUA, and 10% ethylene glycol. Crystals of the ternary complex were obtained using a reservoir solution of 21% monomethylether polyethylene glycol 2000 (MME-PEG-2000), 0.1 m MES, pH 6.0, and a protein solution of 15 mg/ml GlcAT-I in 25 mm HEPES, pH 7.5, 50 mm NaCl, 5 mm MnCl2, 5 mm MgCl2, and 10 mm UDP-GlcUA. Crystals were then transferred in multiple steps into a solution containing 23% MME-PEG-2000, 20 mm MnCl2, 10% ethylene glycol, 0.1 m MES, pH 6.0, 10 mm UDP, and ∼20 mm Galβ1–3Galβ1–4Xyl. Data for the selenomethionine GlcAT-I crystal were collected on Beamline X9B at Brookhaven National Laboratories. Phases for the electron density map were obtained from data collected at a single wavelength equal to 0.97892 Å representing the peak of the anomalous dispersion. All data was processed using DENZO and SCALEPACK (15Otwinowski Z. Minor W. Methods Enzymol. 1997; 276: 307-326Crossref PubMed Scopus (38617) Google Scholar). Positions for the selenium atoms were defined using SHELX (16Sheldrick G.M. Dauter Z. Wilson K.S. Hope H. Sieker L.S. Acta Crystallogr. D. 1993; 49: 18-23Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Phases were calculated in MLPHARE (17The CCP4 suite: Programs for Protein Crystallography Number 4 Collaborative Computional Projec.Acta Crystallogr. D. 1994; 50: 760-763Crossref PubMed Scopus (19797) Google Scholar) and then improved using DM (17The CCP4 suite: Programs for Protein Crystallography Number 4 Collaborative Computional Projec.Acta Crystallogr.

Biol. 1999; 6: 458-463Crossref PubMed Scopus (2565) Google Scholar) was employed to fit approximately half the backbone and several side chains, to the electron density. Following multiple rounds of model building in O (19Jones T.A. Zou J.Y. Cowan S.W. Kjeldgaard M. Acta Crystallogr. Sect.

Open table in a new tab To determine the structure of the ternary complex, one molecule from the acceptor-unbound structure was used as a search model in molecular replacement using the program AMoRe (17The CCP4 suite: Programs for Protein Crystallography Number 4 Collaborative Computional Projec.Acta Crystallogr. D. 1994; 50: 760-763Crossref PubMed Scopus (19797) Google Scholar). Two solutions with correlation coefficients of 17.0 and 12.1 were obtained for the rotation function. The correct solution for two molecules in the translation search gave a correlation coefficient of 61.1 and aR factor of 37.8%. After multiple cycles of model building and refinement, a final R factor of 18.8% and aR free of 21.5% were obtained. The final model contains residues Met75–Pro140 and Trp152–Val335 of molecule A and Met75–Pro140, His154–Glu244, and Arg247–Val335 of molecule B. In addition, each molecule contains a bound UDP molecule, one Mn2+ ion, and an unidentified metal. The Galβ1–3Galβ1–4Xyl substrate is bound to molecule A. Attempts to determine the location of the glucuronic acid by binding UDP-GlcUA have been unsuccessful. The original crystallization conditions with UDP-GlcUA present showed no density for the molecule, probably because of competition with the phosphate buffer present. Electron density for only the UDP segment of the UDP-GlcUA was observed (data not shown) for crystals grown in MME-PEG-2000. To crystallize GlcAT-I, the N-terminal 75 residues including the proposed cytoplasmic, transmembrane, and stem regions were removed. The truncated GlcAT-I-(Thr76–Val335) was expressed in E. coli. The GlcAT-I-(Thr76–Val335) protein and activity co-eluted as a large single peak with an apparent molecular mass of 43 kDa from the gel filtration column (Fig.1). The GlcAT-I-(Thr76-Val335) did not exhibit activity toward asialoorosomucoid, the specific acceptor substrate of GlcAT-P (data not shown). Thus, the recombinant enzyme lacking the N-terminal region appeared to be monomeric in solution and retained significant specific GlcAT-I activity. The present crystal structure has revealed that GlcAT-I-(Thr76–Val335 is approximately 40 × 40 × 50 Å3 in size with an extended C terminus (Fig. 2 A). The enzyme contains a seven-stranded mixed β-sheet, which can be divided into two subdomains. The active site is found in a cleft of the molecule that extends across both subdomains. The N-terminal subdomain is an α/β motif with alternating β-strands and α helices. The β-strands form a parallel β-sheet with strand order 3, 2, 1, and 4. This subdomain contains the majority of the residues associated with donor substrate binding. The C-terminal subdomain, which contains the acceptor substrate binding site, includes β-strands 9, 6, and 10 that form a continuous β-sheet with strands 3, 2, 1, and 4 from the N-terminal subdomain. The C-terminal subdomain is largely a mixed β-sheet with strand order 5, 11, 6, 7, and 8 followed by the C terminus of the molecule extending away from the core along another molecule in the crystal lattice. Crystals grown from both phosphate and MME-PEG contain the same dimer in the asymmetric unit (Fig. 2, B and C). The overall buried surface area for the dimer is 4000 Å2, representing 16% of the total surface area of the two molecules. Residues Leu87–Leu102, Asp196–Arg201, Leu220–Phe226, His240–Trp243, Val304–Leu322, and Arg327–Val335 line the dimer interface. Residues Glu312–Gln318 of one monomer extend into the active site of the other. This orientation positions both N termini on one face of the dimer with the active sites on the opposite face in which the N-terminal membrane-binding domains would be directed in the same orientation. Type II Golgi membrane enzymes such as β1,4-galactosyltransferase have been reported to be homodimers (21Yamaguchi N. Fukuda M.N. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 12170-12176Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar,22Ouzzine, M., Gulnerti, S., Netter, P., Magdalou, J., and Fournel-Gigleux, S. (2000) J. Biol. Chem., in press.Google Scholar). Thus, GlcAT-I, also a type II membrane-associated protein, is likely to be a homodimer in the Golgi membrane. The UDP molecule binds across a long cleft on the surface of the molecule with the uridine and ribose rings mainly centered in the N-terminal subdomain of the molecule. The OD2 oxygen of D113 from strand 3 (Fig. 3) is within hydrogen bonding distance of atom N-3 (2.9 Å) of the uridine ring. The side chain of Tyr84 in β-strand 1 is found in a parallel ring stacking arrangement with the uridine base about 3.5 Å away. Atoms O3* and O2* of the ribose ring are also involved in protein interactions. O3* is 3.0 Å from atom N of Asp195 and 2.5 Å from O of Pro82. O2* is 2.8 Å from OD1 of Asp195. Residues Arg156 and Arg310 form direct interactions with the phosphate groups: atom NH1 of Arg156is found 3.2 Å from O2B of the α phosphate, whereas atom NH1 of Arg310 is located 2.6 Å from O1B of the β phosphate. The Mn2+ atom is in an approximately octahedral coordination state in which two of the coordination atoms, O1B (2.1 Å) and O2A (2.1 Å), are from the β- and α-phosphates of the UDP molecule. Asp196 forms a bidentate interaction through OD1 (2.2 Å) and OD2 (2.2 Å). The remaining two ligands are from two water molecules. One water molecule is found 2.3 Å from the Mn2+and is also hydrogen bound to OD1 of Asn197 (2.8 Å) and O of Thr309 (2.8 Å). The other water molecule is found 2.1 Å from the Mn2+ and 2.6 Å from OD1 of Asp194. Thus, residues Asp194, Asp195, and Asp196 of the conserved DXD motif (23Wiggine C.A.R. Munro S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 7945-7950Crossref PubMed Scopus (321) Google Scholar), are involved in ribose interactions as well as direct and indirect interactions with the Mn2+ ion. A second unidentified metal ion is found in a tetrahedral geometry with ligands O3B of UDP (1.9 Å), NE2 of His308 (2.0 Å), and two possible water molecules (2.0 Å and 2.2 Å). However, it is less certain whether this metal ion is physiological. This metal ion is not present in either the unbound or the UDP/Mn2+/no acceptor substrate structures (data not shown), suggesting that the metal may have come from the trisaccharide solution. Residues involved in acceptor substrate binding are isolated to the C-terminal subdomain of the GlcAT-I molecule. The trisaccharide Galβ1–3Galβ1–4Xyl binds with the O3 of the terminal galactose (Gal-2) 5.1 Å from the O3B atom of the UDP molecule (Fig. 3). Electron density exists only for the Galβ1–3Gal portion of the trisaccharide Galβ1–3Galβ1–4Xyl. Atom OE1 of Glu227 is within hydrogen bonding distance to O-6 of Gal-2 (2.5 Å). NH1 of Arg247 is also found 2.8 Å from O-6. The O-4 oxygen of Gal-2 is found 2.6 Å from OD2 of Asp252 and O-3 of Gal-2 is 2.7 Å from OE2 of Glu281. The Gal-1 moiety is positioned near the surface of the molecule. Residue Gln318of the second monomer is in position to form a hydrogen bond with O-6 of Gal-1. Atoms OE1 and NE2 are positioned 2.6 Å and 3.0 Å, respectively from O-6 of Gal-1. Although Trp243 does not appear to form hydrogen bonds with the acceptor substrate, the plane of the side chain is parallel to the ring of the Gal-1 molecule. Based on the present binding orientation of the acceptor, the Xyl moiety would be expected to reside outside the substrate-binding cavity. However, no density was observed for the Xyl moiety of the trisaccharide. Xyl may simply act as a spacer between the Galβ1–3Gal disaccharide in the substrate cavity, and the protein to which the linker region is attached and consequently would have no specific interactions with the enzyme. The majority of the hydrogen bond interactions between GlcAT-I and the acceptor substrate are through Gal-2. The three-dimensional orientation of residues Glu227, Asp252, and Glu281 in the active site may dictate the specificity for the acceptor substrate through interactions with the O-6, O-4, and O-3 hydroxyl groups of Gal-2. These three residues are highly conserved in all glucuronyltransferases. The reaction catalyzed by GlcAT-I is the transfer of glucuronic acid from UDP-GlcUA to the O-3 oxygen of the terminal Gal-2 of the growing linkage region Galβ1–3Galβ1–4Xylβ1-O-Ser. A reasonable mechanism involves attack by a deprotonated form of the incoming 3-hydroxyl group of the acceptor oligosaccharide, on the C-1 position of the glucuronic acid (Fig. 4). Formation of a GlcUAβ1–3Gal linkage and subsequent dissociation of the UDP molecule follows. This reaction would require a catalytic base to deprotonate the hydroxyl group at the C-3 position of Gal-2. Atom OE2 of Glu281 is located 2.7 Å from the nucleophilic O-3 of the 3-hydroxyl group. This suggests that Glu281 could play a key role as the catalytic base in the transfer reaction. The histidine at position 308 is found located near the β-phosphate of UDP and the O-3 hydroxyl of Gal-2. His308 may interact with the glucuronic acid portion of the UDP-GlcUA molecule either by orienting the glucuronic acid for catalysis or by stabilizing the transition state. Both Glu281 and His308 are totally conserved in all glucuronyltransferases. The present GlcAT-I structure supports the proposed catalytic mechanism for NDP-sugar dependent glycosyltransferases (24Murry B.W. Takayama S. Schultz J. Wong C.-H. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 11183-11195Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar). To date three crystal structures of NDP-sugar dependent-glycosyltransferases have been reported: T4 phage β-glucosyltransferase (25Vrielink A. Ruger W. Driessen H.P Freemont P.S. EMBO J. 1998; 13: 3413-3422Crossref Scopus (227) Google Scholar), bovine β-4-galactosyltransferase (26Gastinel L.N. Cambillau C Bourne Y. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 3546-3557Crossref PubMed Scopus (251) Google Scholar) and SpsA from Bacillus subtilis (17The CCP4 suite: Programs for Protein Crystallography Number 4 Collaborative Computional Projec.Acta Crystallogr. D. 1994; 50: 760-763Crossref PubMed Scopus (19797) Google Scholar). However, none of these structures have acceptor substrate bound. The structure of GlcAT-I shows high similarities in the tertiary fold and NDP binding with SpsA, despite only a 7.3% sequence identity (Fig.5 A). Insightfully, the catalytic base Glu281 of GlcAT-I superimposes with Asp191 of the SpsA structure, which has been proposed as the catalytic base in SpsA (27Charnock S.J. Davies G.J. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 6380-6385Crossref PubMed Scopus (310) Google Scholar) (Fig. 5 B). In addition, Asp252 of GlcAT-I that interacts with O-4 of Gal-2, superimposes well with Asp158 in the SpsA structure. This data suggest that the reaction mechanism and the catalytic site structure may also be applicable to other families of glycosyltransferases. Critical roles of GAGs, especially heparan sulfate, in developmental processes and specific signaling pathways have recently been demonstrated by the identification of mutations in biosynthetic enzymes for heparan sulfate synthesis in the Drosophila, mouse, and human (28Perrimon N. Bernfield M. Nature. 2000; 404: 725-728Crossref PubMed Scopus (662) Google Scholar). The structural biology of GAGs and enzymes involved in GAG biosynthesis is evolving rapidly (29Breton C. Imberty A. Curr. Opin. Struct. Biol. 1999; 9: 563-571Crossref PubMed Scopus (171) Google Scholar). The ternary structure of GlcAT-I is the first, not only for glucuronyltransferases but also for glycosyltransferases that are involved in heparan/heparin biosynthesis. The structure has revealed the basis for understanding glucuronic acid transfer to the linkage region at a branching point common to various GAGs. This structure, along with the crystal structure of the sulfotransferase domain of heparan sulfateN-deacetylase/N-sulfotransferase (30Kakuta T. Sueyoshi T. Negishi M. Pedersen L.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 10673-10676Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar), opens a new era of structural biology of heparan/chondroitin sulfate biosynthesis and GAG biology. The authors would like to thank Dr. Z. Dauter, and Dr. K. Rajashankar for help in data collection and processing at the NSLS beamline X9b, Dr. G. J. Davies for early release of coordinates and helpful discussion of the SpsA structure, as well as Dr. T. Hall, Dr. W. A. Beard, and Dr. L. G. Pedersen for comments on the manuscript."
https://openalex.org/W2019787042,"Proteins of the Ena/VASP family are implicated in processes that require dynamic actin remodeling such as axon guidance and platelet activation. In this work, we explored some of the pathways that likely regulate actin dynamics in part via EVL (Ena/VASP-like protein). Two isoforms, EVL and EVL-I, were highly expressed in hematopoietic cells of thymus and spleen. In CD3-activated T-cells, EVL was found in F-actin-rich patches and at the distal tips of the microspikes that formed on the activated side of the T-cells. Like the other family members, EVL localized to focal adhesions and the leading edge of lamellipodia when expressed in fibroblasts. EVL was a substrate for the cAMP-dependent protein kinase, and this phosphorylation regulated several of the interactions between EVL and its ligands. Unlike VASP, EVL nucleated actin polymerization under physiological conditions, whereas phosphorylation of both EVL and VASP decreased their nucleating activity. EVL bound directly to the Abl, Lyn, and nSrc SH3 domains; the FE65 WW domain; and profilin, likely via its proline-rich core. Binding of Abl and nSrc SH3 domains, but not profilin or other SH3 domains, was abolished by cAMP-dependent protein kinase phosphorylation of EVL. We show strong cooperative binding of two profilin dimers on the polyproline sequence of EVL. Additionally, profilin competed with the SH3 domains for binding to partially overlapping binding sites. These data suggest that the function of EVL could be modulated in a complex manner by its interactions with multiple ligands and through phosphorylation by cyclic nucleotide dependent kinases.

Many pathways lead to dynamic changes of the actin cytoskeleton that form the basis for cell movement in a wide variety of biological phenomena. In recent years, many proteins participating in one or more signal transduction pathways have been identified. One group of multifunctional proteins, involved in actin-based motility, is the Ena/VASP family of proteins that includeDrosophila Ena (Enabled), Mena (mammalian Ena), VASP (vasodilator-stimulatedphosphoprotein), and EVL (Ena/VASP-like protein) (1Gertler F.B.

The Ena/VASP proteins share a common domain structure that consists of an amino-terminal Ena/VASP homology (EVH) 1 domain, a carboxyl-terminal EVH2 domain, and a central proline-rich domain.

In contrast to the highly conserved EVH1 and EVH2 domains, the central proline-rich domain of the different proteins contains variable lengths of consecutive polyproline clusters.

Several lines of evidence suggest that the interactions between profilin and Ena/VASP proteins are important in vivo. In mice, there is a potent dosage-sensitive genetic interaction between Mena and profilin I (5Lanier L.M. Gates M.A. Witke W. Menzies A.S. Wehman A.M. Macklis J.D. Kwiatkowski D. Soriano P.

Although Mena mutants are viable, displaying defects in several nerve fiber tracts in the brain, a reduction of profilin levels by 50% causes Mena mutants to exhibit a severe defect in closure of the cephalic portion of the neural tube. InDrosophila, mutations in Ena and profilin have each been shown to exhibit dosage-sensitive genetic interactions with Abl (2Gertler F.B. Doctor J.S. Hoffmann F.M. Science. 1990; 248: 857-860Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar,23Wills Z. Marr L. Zinn K. Goodman C.S. Van Vactor D. Neuron. 1999; 22: 291-299Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (179) Google Scholar). Despite this genetic evidence, the mechanisms that regulate the interaction and function of Ena/VASP-profilin complexes remain poorly understood (24Lanier L.M. Gertler F.B. Curr. Opin. Neurobiol. 2000; 10: 80-87Crossref PubMed Scopus (178) Google Scholar). The third member of the Ena/VASP family, EVL, has not been functionally characterized. EVL partially restores Listeria movement in cell-free extracts depleted of VASP and Mena (20Laurent V. Loisel T.P. Harbeck B. Wehman A. Grobe L. Jockusch B.M. Wehland J. Gertler F.B. Carlier M.F. J. Cell Biol. 1999; 144: 1245-1258Crossref PubMed Scopus (297) Google Scholar) and shares many structural features with the other family members. The EVH1 domain and distinct parts of the EVH2 domain are homologous, but the central portion differs in both length and proline content. The number of conserved cyclic nucleotide-dependent kinase phosphorylation sites also differs; whereas VASP and Mena have three and two, respectively, EVL has only one site (1Gertler F.B. Niebuhr K. Reinhard M. Wehland J. Soriano P. Cell. 1996; 87: 227-239Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (570) Google Scholar). Although these structural features suggest that the three mammalian proteins have overlapping functions, we show here they may also have unique properties and mechanisms of regulation. To gain further insight in the regulatory pathways linked to actin dynamics, we studied the binding of EVL to actin, profilin, and SH3 domains and the effect of PKA phosphorylation on these interactions. The coding region of EVL was amplified from a mouse embryonic stem cell cDNA library. Murine VASP cDNA was a kind gift of Dr. R. Fässler. Both cDNAs were cloned into pFB-Nhis (Life Technologies, Inc.), and recombinant proteins were obtained by using the Bac-to-BacTM baculovirus expression system (Life Technologies, Inc.) according to the manufacturer's instructions. The protein was purified on Talon resin (CLONTECH) and subsequently dialyzed in PBS. The SH3 domains were purified as GST fusion proteins from Escherichia coli lysates by affinity chromatography on glutathione-agarose (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). Profilin IIa was purified from bovine brain as described (25Lambrechts A. Van Damme J. Goethals M. Vandekerckhove J. Ampe C. Eur. J. Biochem. 1995; 230: 281-286Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). Recombinant profilins I and IIa were expressed in E. coli and purified as described. 3Lambrechts, A., Braun, A., Jonckheere, V., Aszodi, A., Lanier, L. M., Robbens, J., Van Colen, I., Vandekerckhove, J., Fassler, R., and Ampe, C. (2000) Mol. Cell. Biol., in press. We prepared skeletal muscle actin from rabbit muscle (26Spudich J.A. Watt S. J. Biol.

Methods Cell Biol. 1982; 24: 271-289Crossref PubMed Scopus (340) Google Scholar). Pyrene-labeled actin was prepared as described (28Brenner S.L. Korn E.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1983; 258: 5013-5020Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The EVL peptides were chemically synthesized on a Model 431A peptide synthesizer (Applied Biosystems Inc., Foster City, CA) and purified by reversed-phase high pressure liquid chromatography. The mass and purity were assessed by matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization time-of-flight mass spectrometry. The proline-rich peptides are listed in Fig.5. The actin-binding mimetic of the EVH2 domain has the sequence acetyl-C261GGGGLMEEMNKLLAKRRKAASQT283-OH. EVL cDNA was cloned into the pNLSH vector, and EVL-I cDNA into pIRES-EGFP. Retrovirus-containing supernatant supplemented with 4 μg/ml Polybrene was added to Rat2 cells for 16 h at 32 °C. Subsequently, cells were placed at 37 °C; and 48 h after infection, selection was started by adding 5 mm histidinol to the medium. Cells were screened using antibody staining of EVL. Immunofluorescence staining of Rat2 cells was performed essentially as described (1Gertler F.B. Niebuhr K. Reinhard M. Wehland J. Soriano P. Cell. 1996; 87: 227-239Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (570) Google Scholar). Antibodies used were polyclonal antibodies 1404 for EVL and 2197 for Mena and monoclonal antibody 84A5 for EVL. Labeled secondary antibodies were purchased from Jackson ImmunoResearch Laboratories, Inc. Primary T-cells were isolated and cultured as described (29Zhang J. Salojin K. Gao J.X. Cameron M. Geisler C. Delovitch T.L. J. Immunol. 1998; 161: 2930-2937PubMed Google Scholar). Immunofluorescence staining was performed as described for Rat2 cells. Cortical and glial cultures were prepared as described previously (5Lanier L.M. Gates M.A. Witke W. Menzies A.S. Wehman A.M. Macklis J.D. Kwiatkowski D. Soriano P. Gertler F.B. Neuron. 1999; 22: 313-325Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (347) Google Scholar). Cells were rinsed in PBS and then lysed in radioimmune precipitation assay buffer (50 mm Tris, pH 8.0, 150 mm NaCl, 1% Triton X-100, 0.5% deoxycholate, and 0.1% SDS), and protein concentrations were determined using the BCA assay (Pierce). For in vitro kinase or phosphatase treatment, 10 μg of total protein were diluted 1:3 in the reaction buffer supplied by the manufacturer (New England Biolabs Inc.) and incubated with either 15 units of PKA or 1200 units of λ-phosphatase for 30 min at 30 °C. After incubation, samples were boiled in SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis sample buffer and processed for Western blotting using anti-EVL (1404) or anti-VASP (M4, immunoGlobe) polyclonal antibodies. EVL or VASP was incubated with PKA (New England Biolabs Inc.) in PKA buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl and 10 mm MgCl2, pH 7.5) supplemented with 200 μm ATP and 10 μCi of ]γ-32P[ATP for 30 min at 30 °C. Subsequently, phospho-EVL was dialyzed in 50 mm Tris, 0.1 mmEDTA, 5 mm dithiothreitol, and 2 mmMnCl2, pH 7.5, and then treated with λ-phosphatase (New England Biolabs Inc.) for 30 min at 30 °C. 4 μg of EVL, phosphorylated or dephosphorylated, were added to 50 μl of GST-SH3 fusion protein bound to glutathione-agarose in PBS and 1% Triton X-100 and incubated for 30 min at 4 °C. After three washes, the resin was boiled in 1× SDS sample buffer for 5 min. One-tenth of the fraction was loaded onto an 8% SDS-polyacrylamide gel (Bio-Rad) and, after transfer to Hybond-Super, probed with monoclonal antibody 84A1 against EVL. The membrane was probed as described (30Niebuhr K. Wehland J. Lefkovits I. Immunology Methods Manual. Academic Press Ltd., London1997: 798-800Google Scholar). The BIAcore measurements were carried out as described (31Jonckheere V. Lambrechts A. Vandekerckhove J. Ampe C. FEBS Lett. 1999; 447: 257-263Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). EVL was immobilized on Talon resin and incubated with an excess of profilin in 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.1, 1 mm EDTA, and 1 mm dithiothreitol for 30 min at 4 °C. The resin was washed several times and subsequently boiled in SDS sample buffer. GST-nSrc SH3 was bound to glutathione-agarose beads and incubated with purified EVL for 30 min at 4 °C in PBS and 1% Triton X-100. Subsequently, a small column (50 μl) was made and washed twice with PBS and 1% Triton X-100, and then profilin IIa was added in increasing concentrations as indicated. Equal amounts of each eluted fraction were loaded onto SDS-polyacrylamide gel and subjected to Western blotting for EVL detection. For EVL, 4 μmactin (7.5% pyrene-labeled) in G-buffer (5 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.7, 0.2 mm ATP, 0.2 mm dithiothreitol, and 0.1 mm CaCl2) was supplemented with MgCl2 and KCl to final concentrations of 2 and 100 mm, respectively. EVL was added to the concentrations indicated in the legend to Fig. 7 prior to measurement in a Hitachi F-4500 spectrophotometer with excitation and emission wavelengths set at 365 and 388 nm, respectively. For VASP, 1 μm Mg2+/ATP/actin in G-buffer without CaCl2 was used. The polymerization was started by adding MgCl2 and KCl to final concentrations of 2 and 15 mm, respectively, and 1 μm VASP. The subcellular distributions of Mena and VASP have been well characterized in fibroblasts and several other cell types. Since fibroblasts lack detectable levels of EVL (see Fig. 2 B), we examined EVL distribution in primary T-cells, a rich source of EVL protein. When primary CD4+ T-cells were plated on control antibody (anti-CD71)-coated coverslips, EVL was mainly present in the cytoplasm of the cells (data not shown). Plating T-cells on anti-CD3 antibody-coated coverslips induced a clustering of the T-cell receptors and subsequent activation of the polarization response. EVL became localized in F-actin-rich patches that developed on the coverslip side of the cell (Fig. 1 A). In addition to this actin patch localization, EVL could be detected at the distal tips of microspikes that formed in response to T-cell receptor cross-linking (Fig. 1 A). Endogenous VASP (also expressed in this cell type) showed a similar re-localization (data not shown). This observation is consistent with a recent report demonstrating that Ena/VASP proteins play a critical role in the actin reorganization that occurs in activated Jurkat T-cells (15Krause M. Sechi A.S. Konradt M. Monner D. Gertler F.B. Wehland J. J. Cell Biol. 2000; 149: 181-194Crossref PubMed Scopus (256) Google Scholar) and supports a model in which their localization is regulated by specific signal transduction pathways. In fibroblasts, Mena and VASP are recruited to focal adhesions via interactions with proteins containing the EVH1-binding motif (12Niebuhr K. Ebel F. Frank R. Reinhard M. Domann E. Carl U.D. Walter U. Gertler F.B. Wehland J. Chakraborty T. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 5433-5444Crossref PubMed Scopus (333) Google Scholar). To determine if EVL could be targeted by a similar mechanism, we generated Rat2 fibroblasts that express EVL. Staining of these cells revealed that EVL was concentrated in focal adhesions and at the leading edge of the lamellipodium in a pattern very similar to Mena and VASP (Fig.1 B). VASP and Mena have been shown to be substrates for PKA. Since only one of the possible phosphorylation sites mapped in VASP is present in EVL (Ser156) (Fig. 2 A) (1Gertler F.B. Niebuhr K. Reinhard M. Wehland J. Soriano P. Cell. 1996; 87: 227-239Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (570) Google Scholar), we wanted to see if EVL is a substrate for PKA in vivoand in vitro. Western blot analysis of EVL in adult mouse organ extracts revealed two protein bands (Fig. 2 B) (5Lanier L.M. Gates M.A. Witke W. Menzies A.S. Wehman A.M. Macklis J.D. Kwiatkowski D. Soriano P. Gertler F.B. Neuron. 1999; 22: 313-325Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (347) Google Scholar). Similarly, two protein bands were observed in cultured cortical neurons, whereas mainly the upper band was detected in cultured glia (Fig. 2 C). In analogy with VASP and Mena (1Gertler F.B. Niebuhr K. Reinhard M. Wehland J. Soriano P. Cell. 1996; 87: 227-239Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (570) Google Scholar, 32Butt E. Abel K. Krieger M. Palm D. Hoppe V. Hoppe J.

Chem. 1998; 273: 20029-20035Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (275) Google Scholar), we speculated that these two bands represent dephospho and phospho forms of EVL. However, when cortical neuron and glial cell extracts were treated with the catalytic domain of PKA in vitro, Western blot analysis indicated that both protein bands showed a small shift upward rather than the expected shift of the lower form into the slower migrating form (Fig. 2 C). We note that the shift seen for PKA-phosphorylated VASP in glial cells is larger than the one seen for EVL (Fig. 2 D). Treatment of the extracts in vitrowith λ-protein phosphatase (λ-PPase) did not cause any detectable shift in either EVL band as compared with untreated extracts (Fig.2 C). In extracts of Rat2-EVL cells, a single EVL-reactive band comigrated with the lower of the two bands found in spleen and brain (Fig. 2 B), suggesting that the faster migrating form is unlikely to be simply a proteolytic fragment of the slower migrating form. We reasoned that the upper form of EVL found in spleen and cortical neurons might represent a larger isoform of EVL produced by the inclusion of an additional exon. Sequence analysis of both the human genomic locus of EVL as well as mouse expressed sequence tags predicted the existence of an extra small exon. Therefore, it seems likely that alternative splicing of the EVL mRNA produces two isoforms of EVL. The shorter isoform contains the EVL sequence as described originally (1Gertler F.B. Niebuhr K. Reinhard M. Wehland J. Soriano P. Cell. 1996; 87: 227-239Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (570) Google Scholar). The larger protein, which we term EVL-I, contains an extra portion that is 21 amino acids long and is located between Ser339and Arg340 of EVL (Fig. 2, A and G). Western blot analysis of Rat2 cells expressing a cDNA encoding EVL-I indicated that this isoform comigrated with the larger signals observed in spleen (Fig. 2 B). The two isoforms displayed a tissue-specific expression pattern (Fig. 2 B) (5Lanier L.M. Gates M.A. Witke W. Menzies A.S. Wehman A.M. Macklis J.D. Kwiatkowski D. Soriano P. Gertler F.B. Neuron. 1999; 22: 313-325Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (347) Google Scholar), and both isoforms could be phosphorylated by PKA in vitro. Although the EVH1 domain is necessary and sufficient for subcellular targeting of Ena/VASP proteins, the EVH2 domain is also thought to play a role in localization, perhaps by promoting more avid, multimeric complexes (18Ahern-Djamali S.M. Comer A.R. Bachmann C. Kastenmeier A.S. Reddy S.K. Beckerle M.C. Walter U. Hoffmann F.M. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1998; 9: 2157-2171Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). Since the extra sequence included in EVL-I falls in the EVH2 domain, we expressed EVL-I in Rat2 cells to determine if subcellular targeting might be affected by the additional sequence. The staining pattern (Fig. 3) indicated that EVL-I is localized in a pattern very similar to EVL, suggesting that the extra sequence in EVL-I does not alter subcellular targeting under these conditions. To assay whether EVL is also an in vivo substrate of PKA, we stimulated the Rat2-EVL cells with forskolin, an activator of adenylyl cyclase (34Seamon K.B. Daly J.W. J. Cyclic Nucleotide. Res. 1981; 7 (, and references therein): 201-224PubMed Google Scholar). After 10 min, cells were lysed and analyzed by Western blotting. Forskolin induced a similar small band shift as PKA treatment, indicating that EVL can be phosphorylated in vivoby PKA (Fig. 2 E). For further experimental analysis of the effect of phosphorylation on ligand binding, we purified EVL as a His6-tagged protein from the baculovirus expression system. The purified protein was phosphorylated in vitro with the catalytic subunit of PKA and ATP. Typically, after 30 min, all EVL was phosphorylated, and the observed shift was identical to the one seen with native EVL in cell extracts (Fig. 2 F). The shift could be reversed by subsequent treatment with λ-PPase. We used these and similar samples in the actin, profilin, and SH3 domain binding assays. The central proline-rich domain of EVL contains two separate proline-rich sequences, P8VP4 and P6LP separated by a TGST sequence (Fig. 2 A), that contain possible binding sites for SH3 domains (35Ren R. Mayer B.J. Cicchetti P. Baltimore D. Science. 1993; 259: 1157-1161Crossref PubMed Scopus (1022) Google Scholar, 36Mayer B.J. Eck M.J. Curr. Biol. 1995; 5: 364-367Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (177) Google Scholar). To test whether EVL could bind to SH3 domains, several GST-SH3 fusion proteins (Fig.4) were purified and incubated with EVL. The formed complexes were pulled down with glutathione-agarose beads; and after thorough washing, the beads were boiled in sample buffer and analyzed by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. The results are shown in Fig. 4 (upper panel). EVL bound robustly to the Lyn, nSrc, and Abl SH3 domains. The Fyn, Src, and Crkl SH3 domains were poorly bound, whereas the Csk SH3 domain failed to bind detectable levels of EVL. Therefore, EVL can bind to a distinct repertoire of SH3 domains in vitro. The FE65 WW domain, which was previously shown to bind to Mena (22Ermekova K.S. Zambrano N. Linn H. Minopoli G. Gertler F. Russo T. Sudol M. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 32869-32877Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (201) Google Scholar), also interacted with EVL. The interaction between Ena and the Abl SH3 domain is disrupted by tyrosine phosphorylation of Ena (37Comer A.R. Ahern-Djamali S.M. Juang J.L. Jackson P.D. Hoffmann F.M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 152-160Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar), and specific interactions outside the proline-rich core of ligands are also involved in SH3 domain binding (38Feng S. Kasahara C. Rickles R.J. Schreiber S.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 12408-12415Crossref PubMed Scopus (215) Google Scholar). Therefore, we wondered whether phosphorylation of EVL might affect its ability to bind ligands through its proline-rich core since the PKA site is located just in front of this portion of EVL (Fig. 2 A). We performed the same experiment as described above, except"

Although DCX can function as a microtubule-associated protein (MAP), the potential relationship between its MAP activity and neuronal migration is not understood. Here we show that the two clusters of patient mutations precisely define an internal tandem repeat. Each repeat alone binds tubulin, whereas neither repeat is sufficient for co-assembly with microtubules. The two tandem repeats are sufficient to mediate microtubule polymerization, and representative patient missense mutations lead to impaired polymerization both in vitro andin vivo as well as impaired microtubule stabilization. Furthermore, each repeat is predicted to have the secondary structure of a β-grasp superfold motif, a motif not found in other MAPs. The patient mutations are predicted to disrupt the structure of the motif, suggesting that the motif may be critical for the DCX-tubulin interaction.

Here we show that the patient missense mutations define an internal repeat within DCX and that this repeated domain represents a new tubulin-binding motif. Because the patient mutations in DCX lead to defective interactions with microtubules, this suggests that DCX-tubulin interactions are critical for the role of DCX in neuronal migration.DISCUSSIONHere we demonstrate that the clustering of that the naturally occurring patient mutations in DCX precisely outline an internal repeat and that this repeated domain is essential for the function of DCX on microtubule polymerization. These results support the idea that the function of DCX in neuronal migration may be through polymerization of microtubules as previously proposed (5Horesh D. Sapir T. Francis F. Wolf S.G. Caspi M.

Surprisingly, a single DCX repeat can bind to tubulin but not microtubules, and a single repeat is not incorporated into a growing microtubule fiber. Finally, we demonstrate that two intact DCX repeats are necessary and sufficient for microtubule polymerization. This is the first demonstration that each of the two DCX repeats is capable of binding to tubulin and that the two repeats in tandem are sufficient for microtubule polymerization. Additionally, this is the first demonstration that mutant DCX displays a quantitative defect in microtubule polymerization. These data support and extend recently published data (26Sapir T. Horesh D.

Because the sequence of DCX is entirely novel, it was impossible to make predictions about its potential functions in neuronal migration. The clustering of patient mutations in two regions suggested that these regions are critical for the normal function of the protein, but because there is no clear biochemical role for DCX, the function of the critical domains was unclear. The possibility that DCX may function as a microtubule-associated protein was intriguing, because it suggested a potential function; however, there was no prior demonstration that the patient mutations interfered with the microtubule-based function of DCX. Our results provide strong genetic evidence that the critical function of DCX in neuronal migration is likely dependent upon an effect on polymerization of microtubules, because all of the missense mutations occur within the two repeats, and these mutations interfere with DCX-mediated microtubule polymerization.The identification of an internal repeat within the DCX open reading frame is not surprising, because internal repeats are a hallmark of most well known microtubule-associated proteins, including MAP1B, MAP2C, and tau (15Noble M. Lewis S.A. Cowan N.J. J. Cell Biol. 1989; 109: 3367-3376Crossref PubMed Scopus (260) Google Scholar, 19Lee G. Neve R.L. Kosik K.S.

However, the repeated domain of DCX is quite unique in both its length and number of repeats. DCX has two highly conserved ≈90-amino acid repeats, whereas MAP1B, MAP2C, and tau have between three and twenty-one repeats that vary in length from 4 to 18 amino acids. The composition of the region of the repeats between DCX and other microtubule-associated proteins is similar, however, with a high percentage of basic residues and a basic pI. Notably, the pI for each of the DCX repeats is between 9.7 and 9.9, and DCX itself has a pI of approximately 9.3. Therefore, the amino acid residues contained within the DCX repeats are appropriately basic to mediate its microtubule interactions. Interestingly, predicted β-grasp superfolds are not found in other microtubule-associated proteins, based upon analysis using the same algorithms presented above, suggesting that DCX may interact with tubulin in novel ways.The precise defect of mutant DCX in microtubule polymerization is still unclear. Wild type DCX has been demonstrated to lead to polymerization through an effect on nucleation and bundling of microtubules (6Gleeson J.G. Lin P.T. Flanagan L.A. Walsh C.A. Neuron. 1999; 23: 257-271Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1056) Google Scholar), although there may be a primary effect on polymerization of microtubules independent of nucleation and bundling. Additionally, wild type DCX stabilizes microtubules against depolymerization induced by either exposure to cold or colchicine (5Horesh D. Sapir T. Francis F. Wolf S.G. Caspi M. Elbaum M. Chelly J. Reiner O. Hum. Mol. Genet. 1999; 8: 1599-1610Crossref PubMed Scopus (224) Google Scholar, 6Gleeson J.G. Lin P.T. Flanagan L.A. Walsh C.A. Neuron. 1999; 23: 257-271Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1056) Google Scholar). The results presented here from transfected cells suggest a defect in overall polymerization, but it was not possible to differentiate between microtubule nucleation and bundling based upon the methods used here. Additionally, mutant DCX appears to display a defect in microtubule stabilization against cold depolymerization. It will be interesting to use the DCX patient mutations as a tool to further probe the critical interactions between DCX and microtubules.If two repeats are all that is required for tubulin polymerization, then what does the rest of the DCX protein do? Some of the naturally occurring DCX patient mutations delete just the last 30 amino acids (i.e. the carboxyl-terminal region of the serine/proline-rich tail), suggesting that the tail is critical for normal function. This region of DCX may promote protein-protein interactions or somehow positively or negatively regulate the microtubule-interacting effects of DCX. Likewise, the regions surrounding the first repeat appear to positively regulate the ability of the first repeat to co-assemble with microtubules, as the AA 1–171 and 47–171 fragments, containing the 46 amino acids amino-terminal to the first repeat and the inter-repeat region or the inter-repeat region, respectively, partially co-assembled with microtubules. However, the first 46 amino acids and the inter-repeat region are not themselves sufficient for co-assembly with microtubules (data not presented), suggesting that these two regions are not likely to interact directly with microtubules but instead may act as regulators of this binding. Similarly, the AA 1–268 fragment co-assembled with microtubules more efficiently than even the wild type protein, suggesting that the serine/proline-rich tail may function to inhibit the interaction of DCX with microtubules. It will be very interesting to establish the structure of DCX and to identify the physical interactions with tubulin, to better understand how DCX exerts its effects on microtubules.Although human mutations in several different genes have been shown to lead to an impaired ability of each encoded protein to interact with microtubules, to our knowledge DCX is the first example of patient mutations defining a microtubule-binding domain. For example, Opitz syndrome is a failure of proper closure of midline structures during development in humans, and human mutations in the responsible gene,midin, appear to interfere with the ability of the encoded protein to associate with microtubules (29Cainarca S. Messali S. Ballabio A. Meroni G. Hum. Mol. Genet. 1999; 8: 1387-1396Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar). Similarly, some of the mutations identified in the neurofibromin gene, which leads to neurofibromatosis I, impair the ability of the encoded protein to bind to microtubules (30Xu H. Gutmann D.H. Brain Res. 1997; 759: 149-152Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). Perhaps the best known example of mutations in a microtubule-associated protein leading to human disease is tau, wherein mutations lead to frontotemporal dementia and parkinsonism (FTDP-17) (31Hutton M. Lendon C.L. Rizzu P. Baker M. Froelich S. Houlden H. Pickering-Brown S. Chakraverty S. Isaacs A. Grover A. Hackett J. Adamson J. Lincoln S. Dickson D. Davies P. Petersen R.C. Stevens M. de Graaff E.

Human mutations largely occur around the tau repeats (31Hutton M. Lendon C.L. Rizzu P. Baker M. Froelich S. Houlden H. Pickering-Brown S. Chakraverty S. Isaacs A. Grover A. Hackett J. Adamson J. Lincoln S. Dickson D. Davies P. Petersen R.C. Stevens M. de Graaff E. Wauters E. van Baren J. Hillebrand M. Joosse M. Kwon J.M. Nowotny P. Heutink P. Nature. 1998; 393: 702-705Crossref PubMed Scopus (2878) Google Scholar), and some of these mutations reduce the ability of tau to bind microtubules and promote microtubule assembly (32Hong M. Zhukareva V. Vogelsberg-Ragaglia V. Wszolek Z. Reed L. Miller B.I. Geschwind D.H. Bird T.D. McKeel D. Goate A. Morris J.C. Wilhelmsen K.C. Schellenberg G.D. Trojanowski J.Q. Lee V.M. Science. 1998; 282: 1914-1917Crossref PubMed Scopus (809) Google Scholar), although there is some controversy regarding this issue (33DeTure M. Ko L.W. Yen S. Nacharaju P. Easson C. Lewis J. van Slegtenhorst M. Hutton M. Yen S.H. Brain Res. 2000; 853: 5-14Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). The diversity of diseases that are related to impaired microtubule regulation is a reminder of the diversity of capacities and essential roles that microtubules play in nearly all aspects of cellular functioning.DCX Repeats in Other Novel Proteins Suggest Microtubule InteractionsThe presence of two intact DCX repeats in several other human proteins, including the retinitis pigmentosa 1(RP1) gene, suggest that these two repeats may play essential roles in other biological processes. At least two human proteins, DCAMKL1 and RP1, contain two tandem DCX repeats, and in fact the highest homology between these three proteins is in these repeats. Furthermore, many of the critical amino acid residues as defined by the DCX patient mutations are conserved between all three proteins. Although the function of DCAMKL1remains unknown, it appears to bind to and polymerize microtubules, 2P. T. Lin, J. G. Gleeson, and C. A. Walsh, unpublished observation. an effect most likely related to the conserved DCX repeats. In addition to a DCX domain in the amino-half of the protein, DCAMKL1 contains a CaM kinase domain in the carboxyl-half (1des Portes V. Pinard J.M. Billuart P. Vinet M.C. Koulakoff A. Carrie A.

Cell. 1998; 92: 63-72Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (872) Google Scholar), suggesting that the DCX domain may be paired with other domains, possibly to mediate specific microtubule-based cellular events. RP1 contains a DCX domain in its amino terminus, although the rest of the 2156-amino acid protein has only minimal similarities to other proteins. All of the identified human mutations in RP1 are predicted to lead to premature protein termination (34Sullivan L.S. Heckenlively J.R. Bowne S.J. Zuo J. Hide W.A. Gal A. Denton M. Inglehearn C.F.

Additionally, DCX is present at sufficient concentrations in neurons to stabilize microtubules, because quantitative Western analysis of neuronally enriched cultures suggest that DCX is present at approximately a 1:70 molar ratio to tubulin, 3K. R. Taylor and J. G. Gleeson, unpublished observation. which is within an order of magnitude of the1:15 ratio of DCX:tubulin that leads to optimal DCX-mediated microtubule polymerization in vitro.However, it is still unclear as to which aspects of neuronal migration are defective in neurons with mutant DCX. Some humans with lissencephaly display hemideletions in a second gene known asLIS1 (37Reiner O. Carrozzo R. Shen Y. Wehnert M. Faustinella F. Dobyns W.B. Caskey C.T. Ledbetter D.H.

Lacking either membrane-anchoring mechanism, the newly discovered CA-MMP/MMP-23 was reported to be expressed as a cell-associated protein. In this report, we present evidence that CA-MMP is expressed as an integral membrane zymogen with an N-terminal signal anchor, and secreted as a fully processed mature enzyme. We further demonstrate that L20GAALSGLCLLSALALL36 is required for this unique membrane localization as a signal anchor and its secretion is regulated by a proprotein convertase motif RRRR79sandwiched between its pro- and catalytic domains. Thus, CA-MMP is a type II transmembrane MMP that can be regulated by a single proteolytic cleavage for both activation and secretion, establishing a novel paradigm for protein trafficking and processing within the secretory pathway.

Recently, localization and trafficking of MMPs have been recognized as important mechanisms of regulation, but remain poorly defined.MMPs discovered so far can be classified into two categories based on cellular localization: secreted or membrane-bound. The secreted MMPs are generally synthesized and discharged to the extracellular milieu where they are activated, bind to, and degrade their ECM substrates (9Birkedal-Hansen H. Moore W.G. Bodden M.K.

On the other hand, members of the MT-MMP subgroup are limited to the cellular membranes, mostly the plasma membrane via a type I transmembrane domain or glycosylphosphatidylinositol anchor (13Nakahara H.

More dramatically, MT1-MMP-deficient mice are the first to display developmental abnormalities, in contrast to the apparent normal phenotypes reported for those from secreted MMPs, underscoring the significance of the membrane-bound MMPs (6Holmbeck K. Bianco P. Caterina J. Yamada S. Kromer M. Kuznetsov S.A. Mankani M. Robey P.G. Poole A.R. Pidoux I. Ward J.M. Birkedal-Hansen H.

Haemostasis. 1999; 82: 846-849Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar).CA-MMP, a novel MMP identified recently (27Pei D. FEBS Lett. 1999; 457: 262-270Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar), is apparently the mouse orthologue of human MMP-23 (28Velasco G. Pendas A.M. Fueyo A. Knauper V. Murphy G. Lopez-Otin C. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 4570-4576Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (181) Google Scholar). Tissue distributions of this enzyme suggest that it may play an important role in the functions of lung, heart, as well as the reproductive organs such as ovary and prostate (27Pei D. FEBS Lett. 1999; 457: 262-270Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar, 28Velasco G. Pendas A.M. Fueyo A. Knauper V. Murphy G. Lopez-Otin C. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 4570-4576Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (181) Google Scholar). Enzymatically, purified CA-MMP behaves like a classic MMP: detectable on zymography and inhibited by tissue inhibitor of matrix metalloproteinases (TIMPs) (27Pei D. FEBS Lett. 1999; 457: 262-270Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). Structurally, CA-MMP shares only two features with the rest of the MMP family, a conserved catalytic domain and a basic motif RRRR79 (27Pei D. FEBS Lett. 1999; 457: 262-270Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar, 28Velasco G. Pendas A.M. Fueyo A. Knauper V. Murphy G. Lopez-Otin C. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 4570-4576Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (181) Google Scholar). Otherwise, CA-MMP resembles little of a MMP. First, while all MMPs discovered so far are regulated by a latency mechanism based on a cysteine switch (29Van Wart H.E. Birkedal-Hansen H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 5578-5582Crossref PubMed Scopus (1192) Google Scholar), CA-MMP may employ an entirely different mechanism for latency because there is no cysteine in its putative prodomain (27Pei D. FEBS Lett. 1999; 457: 262-270Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). Second, we suggested that CA-MMP differ from the other MMPs by having two novel domains downstream of its catalytic domain: a cysteine-array (CA) and an Ig-like domain (27Pei D. FEBS Lett. 1999; 457: 262-270Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar), replacing the hinge and hemopexin-like domains implicated in interactions with substrates and intergrins (30Sanchez-Lopez R. Alexander C.M. Behrendtsen O. Breathnach R. Werb Z. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 7238-7247Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 31Brooks P.C. Silletti S. von Schalscha T.L. Friedlander M. Cheresh D.A. Cell. 1998; 92: 391-400Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (572) Google Scholar). Experimentally, CA-MMP has been shown as a cell-associated protein with no detectable secretion in COS cells (27Pei D. FEBS Lett. 1999; 457: 262-270Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). Given its lack of a C-terminal transmembrane domain or glycosylphosphatidylinositol anchor found in the MT-MMPs, we hypothesize that CA-MMP may possess a novel mechanism for cellular localization. In this report, we present evidence that CA-MMP is localized as a type II transmembrane proteinase via a signal anchor. Furthermore, a specific cleavage at Arg79 releases active CA-MMP into the extracellular milieu. The apparent coupling of secretion and activation for a membrane-anchored zymogen defines an unprecedented strategy to regulate proteolytic activity.DISCUSSIONProteolysis is a basic mechanism of regulation in biology as exemplified by the caspase-mediated execution of cell death (48Salvesen G.S. Dixit V.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 10964-10967Crossref PubMed Scopus (766) Google Scholar), proteosome-regulated progression of cell cycle (49Kirschner M. Trends Cell Biol. 1999; 9: M42-M45Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar), and antigen processings (50Villadangos J.A. Bryant R.A. Deussing J. Driessen C. Lennon-Dumenil A.M. Riese R.J. Roth W. Saftig P. Shi G.P. Chapman H.A. Peters C. Ploegh H.L. Immunol. Rev. 1999; 172: 109-120Crossref PubMed Scopus (204) Google Scholar). The diversity and complexity of proteolysis may rival some of the better known biochemical processes such as phosphorylation/dephosphorylation. Irreversible and destructive in nature, proteolysis must be controlled tightly. With ECM components as substrates, members of the MMP family are encoded and synthesized as zymogens to be either secreted or displayed as surface proteinases via a type I transmembrane domain or glycosylphosphatidylinositol link, providing multiple steps for cells to regulate their activities under both physiological as well as pathological conditions (for reviews, see Refs. 9Birkedal-Hansen H. Moore W.G. Bodden M.K. Windsor L.J. Birkedal-Hansen B. DeCarlo A. Engler J.A. Crit. Rev. Oral Biol. Med. 1993; 4: 197-250Crossref PubMed Scopus (2630) Google Scholar and 10Massova I. Kotra L.P. Fridman R. Mobashery S. FASEB J. 1998; 12: 1075-1095Crossref PubMed Scopus (698) Google Scholar). Here we report the characterization of CA-MMP as a type II membrane-anchored zymogen that is proteolytically processed at a conserved motif and converted into a secretory and mature enzyme. This unique mechanism of localization and processing may allow cells to control the proteolytic activity of CA-MMP more efficiently in ECM remodeling events.CA-MMP is the first MMP to be demonstrated as a type II transmembrane protein. Among ∼25 MMPs discovered so far, they can be classified into two basic groups based on their cellular localizations. The first group is relatively large and made of secretory MMPs including collagenases, gelatinases, and stromeolysins (10Massova I. Kotra L.P. Fridman R. Mobashery S. FASEB J. 1998; 12: 1075-1095Crossref PubMed Scopus (698) Google Scholar). The second group is smaller and made of the 6 MT-MMPs (14Will H. Hinzmann B. Eur. J. Biochem. 1995; 231: 602-608Crossref PubMed Scopus (317) Google Scholar, 15Takino T. Sato H. Shinagawa A. Seiki M. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 23013-23020Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (447) Google Scholar, 16Puente X.S. Pendas A.M. Llano E. Velasco G. Lopez-Otin C. Cancer Res. 1996; 56: 944-949PubMed Google Scholar, 17Sato H. Takino T. Okada Y. Cao J. Shinagawa A. Yamamoto E. Seiki M. Nature. 1994; 370: 61-65Crossref PubMed Scopus (2365) Google Scholar, 18Pei D. Cell Res. 1999; 9: 291-303Crossref PubMed Scopus (169) Google Scholar, 19Pei D. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 8925-8932Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (228) Google Scholar). Based on the membrane anchoring mechanisms, these MT-MMPs may be further divided into type I transmembrane MMPs for MT1–3, 5-MMPs, and the glycosylphosphatidylinositol-anchored MMPs (MT4, 6-MMPs) (20Itoh Y. Kajita M. Kinoh H. Mori H. Okada A. Seiki M. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 34260-34266Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar). Thus, CA-MMP would establish the third subclass of membrane-bound MMPs as a novel type II transmembrane MMP. Without any precedence, we initially questioned the validity of the sequence-based prediction of CA-MMP being a type II transmembrane protein (Fig. 1). Although consistent with the finding that the majority of CA-MMP is cell-associated (27Pei D. FEBS Lett. 1999; 457: 262-270Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar), CA-MMP could be associated with the cells by means other than being transmembrane-anchored. Thus, we devoted our effort to (i) verify that CA-MMP is an integral membrane protein by cell fractionation and differential extractions with high salt, alkali, and Trition X-100 (Fig. 2) (35Wahlberg J.M. Spiess M. J. Cell Biol. 1997; 137: 555-562Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar, 39Gilmore R. Blobel G. Cell. 1985; 42: 497-505Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (163) Google Scholar), (ii) demonstrate by N-terminal sequencing that L20GAALSGLCLLSALALL36 is retained with CA-MMP as a signal-anchor rather than being a cleavable signal peptide (41Rapoport T.A. Jungnickel B. Kutay U. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1996; 65: 271-303Crossref PubMed Scopus (492) Google Scholar), and (iii) establish that the first 39 residues including the signal anchor is sufficient to localize a soluble reporter protein, GFP, to membrane and the signal anchor is required for the observed localizations. Taken together, these three independent lines of evidence argue strongly that CA-MMP is an integral membrane protein with L20GAALSGLCLLSALALL36 as the signal anchor. As for its topology, CA-MMP was predicted to be a type II transmembrane protein based on the charge rules (35Wahlberg J.M. Spiess M. J. Cell Biol. 1997; 137: 555-562Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar, 43von Heijne G. Nature. 1989; 341: 456-458Crossref PubMed Scopus (427) Google Scholar). The 19 residues that precede the signal anchor contain a net charge of +2 for CA-MMP and its orthologues whereas the downstream sequences contain a −2 for rat and mouse and 0 for human. This charge distribution would favor the transfer of the carboxyl side into the lumen (the positive inside rule) (43von Heijne G. Nature. 1989; 341: 456-458Crossref PubMed Scopus (427) Google Scholar). We proved this prediction by demonstrating that CA-MMP is N-glycosylated, a process unique for protein residing in the lumen of the secretory pathway (Fig. 4). Since the 4 likely N-glycosylation sites (Asn93, Asn149, Asn233, and Asn317, see Fig. 1 A) are located downstream of the signal anchor, the carboxyl side must reside in the lumen in order to beingN-glycosylated (Fig. 4). Together, this evidence argues that CA-MMP is a type II transmembrane protein.The coupled secretion and activation of CA-MMP is regulated by a conserved PC motif RRRR79. Being a type II transmembrane zymogen, CA-MMP assumes a reverse topology in comparison to the MT-MMPs (14Will H. Hinzmann B. Eur. J. Biochem. 1995; 231: 602-608Crossref PubMed Scopus (317) Google Scholar, 15Takino T. Sato H. Shinagawa A. Seiki M. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 23013-23020Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (447) Google Scholar, 17Sato H. Takino T. Okada Y. Cao J. Shinagawa A. Yamamoto E. Seiki M. Nature. 1994; 370: 61-65Crossref PubMed Scopus (2365) Google Scholar, 19Pei D. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 8925-8932Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (228) Google Scholar). The obligatory removal of its N-terminal prodomain would release the mature enzyme into the lumen and result in secretion. Sandwiched between its pro- and catalytic domains, there is a motif, RRRR79, which could be recognized by PCs (27Pei D. FEBS Lett. 1999; 457: 262-270Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar, 28Velasco G. Pendas A.M. Fueyo A. Knauper V. Murphy G. Lopez-Otin C. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 4570-4576Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (181) Google Scholar). A similar RXKR motif has been demonstrated to be important for zymogen activation of MMP-11 through a process mediated by furin, a prototype PC (38Pei D. Weiss S.J. Nature. 1995; 375: 244-247Crossref PubMed Scopus (530) Google Scholar). Thus, a single cleavage at Arg79 could not only release CA-MMP from the membrane, but also remove its N-terminal prodomain. Indeed, we mapped the cleavage site for secreted CA-MMP at Arg79 (Figs. 3 and 8), thus, confirming a coupled process for both secretion and activation. This is an interesting strategy because cells secrete only active CA-MMP, not latent ones like other secretory MMPs (9Birkedal-Hansen H. Moore W.G. Bodden M.K. Windsor L.J. Birkedal-Hansen B. DeCarlo A. Engler J.A. Crit. Rev. Oral Biol. Med. 1993; 4: 197-250Crossref PubMed Scopus (2630) Google Scholar, 10Massova I. Kotra L.P. Fridman R. Mobashery S. FASEB J. 1998; 12: 1075-1095Crossref PubMed Scopus (698) Google Scholar). Accordingly, we speculate that CA-MMP functions in short distances from its origin of expression since its long distant efficacy would certainly be compromised by free tissue inhibitor of matrix metalloproteinases (TIMPs) in the extracellular milieu. Alternatively, the demand for CA-MMP activity is so acute that only an efficient and timely delivery of active species may meet the requirement. Both features would fit well with rapidity of the ovulation process where CA-MMP is expressed at relatively high levels (28Velasco G. Pendas A.M. Fueyo A. Knauper V. Murphy G. Lopez-Otin C. J. Biol.

Proteolytic cleavage at the RX(K/R)R motif in these proproteins converts latent protein into active species, executing an irreversible step in biological regulations. In an evolutionary sense, the recruitment of a similar motif for the coupled secretion and activation of CA-MMP represents the first precedence with an unusual degree of degeneracy by converting a two-step process with implied flexibility to a single rigid one. The tradeoff may be efficiency and ease of control for dispensing the “right” amount of CA-MMP activity. It is not clear whether this strategy is advantageous over the standard processes of secretion mediated by signal peptidases and subsequent activation in the extracellular milieu for most of the secretory MMPs (10Massova I. Kotra L.P. Fridman R. Mobashery S. FASEB J. 1998; 12: 1075-1095Crossref PubMed Scopus (698) Google Scholar, 12Nagase H. Biol. Chem. 1997; 378: 151-160PubMed Google Scholar). Considering its divergent structure from the other MMPs, CA-MMP is certainly evolved with a dramatically different design (27Pei D. FEBS Lett. 1999; 457: 262-270Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar, 28Velasco G. Pendas A.M. Fueyo A. Knauper V. Murphy G. Lopez-Otin C. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 4570-4576Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (181) Google Scholar). We can only speculate that such a unique design of domain structure warrants a coupled strategy for secretion and activation. Through a signal anchor, the cells retain latent CA-MMP within the cells, most likely in the ER network (Figs. 6 and 10), effectively eliminating any possibility of unwanted activation in the extracellular milieu. Since members of the PCs are known to be localized in the trans-Golgi network (47Steiner D.F. Curr. Opin. Chem. Biol. 1998; 2: 31-39Crossref PubMed Scopus (577) Google Scholar), trafficking of CA-MMP to the trans-Golgi complex would trigger the cleavage at Arg79 and result in the release of active CA-MMP (Fig.10). Thus, we predict that a key regulatory and rate-limiting step in controlling CA-MMP activity be the trafficking from ER to the trans-Golgi network (Fig. 10). Consequently, the observed low level of secretion in CA-MMP transfected MDCK cells may represent only the basal level of secretion in an overexpression system. It is possible that endocrine factors responsible for orchestrating the well executed turnover of ECM during ovulation may actually regulate the trafficking of CA-MMP from ER to the trans-Golgi network where the presumed cleavage by PCs takes place (Fig. 10). This attractive hypothesis is testable if cells from ovulating ovaries become available. Furthermore, the significance of the coupled secretion and activation could be tested in vivo by a “knock-in” approach to replace the signal anchor with a classic signal peptide. It would be interesting to see if such as a modified CA-MMP can substitute the wild type gene in vivo. Nonetheless, the discovery that CA-MMP/MMP-23 is a type II transmembrane proteinase with a coupled secretion and activation mechanism not only introduces a novel mechanism of regulation for MMP-mediated proteolysis but also establish an interesting paradigm for protein trafficking and processing within the secretory pathway. Proteolysis mediated by metalloproteinases has been implicated in a diverse range of biological processes such as signal transduction (1Prenzel N. Zwick E. Daub H. Leserer M. Abraham R. Wallasch C.

PKC consists of at least 11 isoforms showing diversity in their structures, cellular distributions, and biological functions (8Jaken S. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1996; 8: 168-173Crossref PubMed Scopus (407) Google Scholar). The members of the classical PKCs α, β1, β2, and γ bind phorbol esters and are Ca2+-dependent. The novel PKCs δ, ε, η, and θ do not depend on Ca2+ but bind phorbol esters. The third subfamily includes the atypical PKCs (PKCζ and PKCι/λ), which do not bind either Ca2+ or phorbol esters, and PKCμ, which exhibits unique characteristics (9Johannes F.J. Prestle J. Eis S. Oberhagemann P. Pfizenmaier K. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 6140-6148Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). All PKC isoforms can be divided into an N-terminal regulatory domain and a C-terminal catalytic domain with serine-threonine kinase activity (10Hug H. Sarre T.F. Biochem.

Both domains contain conserved (C) regions of extended sequence homology and variable (V) regions. In the classical PKC isoforms the regulatory domain contains a Ca2+-binding domain, and in both the classical and novel PKC isoforms it contains a pair of highly conserved zinc fingers (C1 domains) that bind phorbol esters and a pseudosubstrate region (12Burns D.J.

PKCδ is a widely expressed member of the novel PKCs (15Gschwendt M. Eur. J. Biochem. 1999; 259: 555-564Crossref PubMed Scopus (230) Google Scholar). This isoform has been associated with the proliferation of various cells in a cell type-specific manner. For example, PKCδ inhibited the proliferation of smooth muscle cells (16Fukumoto S.

In contrast, in breast cancer cells PKCδ has been shown to increase tumorigenicity (19Li W. Jiang Y.X. Zhang J. Soon L. Flechner L. Kapoor V. Pierce J.H. Wang L.H. Mol. Cell.

Thus, PKCδ has been shown to undergo translocation and activation during differentiation of keratinocytes (20Denning M.F. Dlugosz A.A. Williams E.K. Szallasi Z. Blumberg P.M. Yuspa S.H. Cell Growth Differ. 1995; 6: 149-157PubMed Google Scholar) and overexpression of this isoform induced squamous (21Ohba M. Ishino K. Kashiwagi M. Kawabe S. Chida K. Huh N.H. Kuroki T. Mol. Cell.

Recent studies suggest that PKCδ associates with different tyrosine kinases and that this association can induce the tyrosine phosphorylation of PKCδ itself and can affect the activity of both the tyrosine kinases and PKC (15Gschwendt M.

The phosphorylation site(s) and the role of tyrosine phosphorylation of PKCδ in its activity and in its function are just beginning to be understood. Two specific sites in the regulatory domain, tyrosines 187 and 52, have been reported so far to be phosphorylated in response to PDGF and FcεRI, respectively (29Szallasi Z. Denning M.F. Chang E.Y. Rivera J. Yuspa S.H. Lehel C. Olah Z. Anderson W.B. Blumberg P.M. Biochem. Cell Biol. 1995; 214: 888-894Google Scholar), and tyrosine 311 has been shown to be phosphorylated by Src (30Blake R.A. Garcia-Paramio P. Parker P.J. Courtneidge S.A. Cell Growth Differ. 1999; 10: 231-241PubMed Google Scholar). In contrast, tyrosine residues in the catalytic domain of PKCδ have been reported to be phosphorylated in response to H2O2 (28Konishi H. Tanaka M. Takemura Y. Matsuzaki H. Ono Y. Kikkawa U. Nishizuka Y. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 11233-11237Crossref PubMed Scopus (538) Google Scholar). In a recent study (23Brodie C. Bogi K. Acs P. Lorenzo P.S. Baskin L. Blumberg P.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 30713-30718Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar), we found that in C6 glioma cells tyrosine phosphorylation of PKCδ in the regulatory domain mediated the inhibitory effect of this isoform on the expression of the astrocytic marker, glutamine synthetase (GS). In the present study, we found that tyrosine phosphorylation of PKCδ also plays a role in the inhibitory effect of PKCδ on cell proliferation and have identified different tyrosine residues that are involved in the selective effects of PKCδ on cell proliferation and GS expression. PDGF and an affinity-purified polyclonal anti-PKCε antibody against a polypeptide corresponding to amino acids 726–737 of PKCε were purchased from Life Technologies, Inc. Monoclonal anti-PKC and anti-GS antibodies were obtained from Transduction Laboratories (Lexington, KY). Polyclonal anti-PKC antibodies and anti-Src, -Fyn, and -Lyn antibodies were from Santa Cruz (Santa Cruz, CA). PMA was from Alexis Co. (San Diego, CA). Leupeptin, aprotinin, phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and sodium vanadate were obtained from Sigma. The PKC chimeras were generated by exchanging the regulatory and catalytic domains of PKCα, -δ, and -ε as described by Acs et al. (31Acs P. Bogi K. Lorenzo P.S. Marquez A.M. Biro T. Szallasi Z. Blumberg P.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 22148-22153Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). PKCα/δ refers to the chimera with the PKCα regulatory domain and the PKCδ catalytic domain, and PKCδ/α refers to the reciprocal chimera. The PKC cDNAs were subcloned into the metallothionein promoter-driven eukaryotic expression vector (MTH). The vector sequence encodes a C-terminal PKCε-derived 12-amino acid tag (εMTH) that is added to the expressed proteins (44Olah Z. Lehel C. Jakab G. Anderson W.B. Anal. Biochem. 1994; 221: 94-102Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). The expression of these chimeras and their activities in C6 cells were described recently (23Brodie C. Bogi K. Acs P. Lorenzo P.S. Baskin L. Blumberg P.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 30713-30718Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). Mouse PKCδ was cloned into the pGEM-T vector (Promega, Madison, WI) as described previously (23Brodie C. Bogi K. Acs P. Lorenzo P.S. Baskin L. Blumberg P.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 30713-30718Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). This plasmid served as our “master” vector for the site-directed mutagenesis, using the Transformer Site-Directed Mutagenesis Kit from CLONTECH (Palo Alto, CA). Conversion of tyrosine residues at sites 52, 64, 155, 187, and 565 into phenylalanine was performed as described previously (23Brodie C. Bogi K. Acs P. Lorenzo P.S. Baskin L. Blumberg P.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 30713-30718Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). PKCδ and the PKCδ mutants were subcloned into the metallothionein promoter-driven eukaryotic expression vector (εMTH). cDNAs encoding the murine PKCδ and the various PKCδ mutants were fused into the N-terminal-enhanced GFP vector pEGFP-N1 (CLONTECH, Palo Alto, CA). The original pEGFP-N1 vector was modified by the insertion of an MluI site in the plasmid polylinker. The restriction site was created by ligating a phosphorylated linker containing the MluI site into pEGFP-N1 digested with SmaI. The construct was verified by sequencing. The clones containing the GFP-PKCδ- or GFP-fused to the different PKCδ mutants were constructed by the excision of PKCδ or the specific mutants from MTH-PKC plasmids by digestion withXhoI and MluI. The inserts were then ligated into the modified GFP vector using the same restriction sites. DNA sequencing of the GFP-PKC constructs confirmed the intended reading frame. C6 cells of late passages (50), that exhibit an astrocytic phenotype, were used in this study. Cells of these passages showed somewhat smaller response to overexpression of PKCδ as compared with the C6 cells of passage 30, which exhibit progenitor properties (17Brodie C. Kuperstein I. Acs P. Blumberg P.M. Brain Res. Mol. Brain Res. 1998; 56: 108-117Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar, 23Brodie C. Bogi K. Acs P. Lorenzo P.S. Baskin L. Blumberg P.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 30713-30718Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). For the current studies we chose cells of late passages, because we wanted to focus on the effects of PKCδ on the expression of GS and not on general aspects of cell differentiation. Cells (1 × 105 cells/ml) were seeded on tissue culture dishes (10 cm) and were grown in medium consisting of Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 10% heat-inactivated fetal calf serum, 2 mm glutamine, penicillin (50 units/ml), and streptomycin (0.05 mg/ml). The cells were transfected either with the empty vectors, the different PKCδ expression vectors, or a Fyn dominant negative mutant in pSG5 (kindly provided by Alan P. Saltiel) using LipofectAMINE (Life Technologies, Inc.) as described previously (17Brodie C. Kuperstein I. Acs P. Blumberg P.M. Brain Res. Mol. Brain Res. 1998; 56: 108-117Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). Experiments were routinely carried out on a clone of the transfected cells, but all the results were confirmed on one pool and two additional individual clones. For overexpression of the GFP-PKCδ fusion proteins, C6 cells were seeded onto 40-mm round glass coverslips at a density of 5 × 104 cells/coverslip. Twenty-four hours later, cells were transfected with the different GFP-PKCδ constructs using LipofectAMINE Plus reagent according to the manufacturer's instructions. All experiments were performed 48 h post-transfection. Cells were washed and resuspended in serum-free medium. The plates were placed on ice, scraped with a rubber policeman, and centrifuged at 1,400 rpm for 10 min. The supernatants were aspirated, and the cell pellets were resuspended in 100 μl of lysis buffer (25 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 50 mm NaCl, 0.5% sodium deoxycholate, 2% Nonidet P-40, 0.2% SDS, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 50 μg/ml aprotinin, 50 μm leupeptin, 0.5 mmNa3VO4) on ice for 15 min. The cell lysates were centrifuged for 15 min at 14,000 rpm in an Eppendorf microcentrifuge, supernatants were removed, and 2× sample buffer was added. Lysates (20 μg of protein) were resolved by SDS-PAGE (10%) and were transferred to nitrocellulose membranes. The membranes were blocked with 5% dry milk in phosphate-buffered saline and subsequently stained with the primary antibody. Specific reactive bands were detected using a goat anti-rabbit or goat anti-mouse IgG conjugated to horseradish peroxidase (Bio-Rad), and the immunoreactive bands were visualized by the ECL Western blotting detection kit (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). Immunoprecipitation was performed as described previously (23Brodie C. Bogi K. Acs P. Lorenzo P.S. Baskin L. Blumberg P.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 30713-30718Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). Briefly, C6 cells overexpressing PKCδ or the PKCδ mutants were serum-starved overnight and treated for different periods of time with PMA (10 nm) or PDGF (100 ng/ml). The samples were preabsorbed with 25 μl of protein A/G-Sepharose (50%) for 10 min, and immunoprecipitation was performed using 4 μg/ml antibody for 1 h at 4 °C and then incubated with 30 μl of A/G-Sepharose for an additional hour. Following washes, the pellets were resuspended in 25 μl of SDS sample buffer and boiled for 5 min. The entire supernatants were subjected to Western blotting. Membranes were incubated with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibodies for 1 h at room temperature. The membranes were washed and visualized by the ECL system. PKC activity was assayed by measuring the incorporation of 32P from [γ-32P]ATP into substrate in the presence of 100 μg/ml phosphatidylserine and 1 μm PMA as described previously (23Brodie C. Bogi K. Acs P. Lorenzo P.S. Baskin L. Blumberg P.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 30713-30718Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). Cells overexpressing the wild-type PKCδ or the PKCδ mutants were seeded in triplicate and incubated in the absence or presence of ZnCl2 (20 μm) for 24 h followed by treatment with PMA (30 nm) for an additional 48 h. Cells were pulsed with 0.5 μCi of [3H]thymidine for the last 6 h and then harvested. The incorporation of [3H]thymidine was determined in a Beckman Scintillation counter. Confocal fluorescent images were collected with a Bio-Rad MRC 1024 confocal scan head (Bio-Rad) mounted on a Nikon microscope with a 60× planapochromat lens. Excitation at 488 nm was generated by a krypton-argon gas laser with a 522/32 emission filter for green fluorescence. For kinetics of GFP-PKCδ translocation in living cells, cells plated on a 40-mm-round coverslip were enclosed in a Bioptechs Focht Chamber System (Bioptechs, Butler, PA). The chamber was inverted and attached to the microscope stage with a custom stage adapter; a temperature controller set at 37 °C was connected, and medium was perfused through the chamber with a Lambda microperfusion pump. Sequential images of the same cell were collected at various time points using LaserSharp Software. The results are presented as the mean values ± S.E. All data were analyzed using a paired Student'st test to determine the level of difference between the treatments. In a recent study we demonstrated that the regulatory domain of PKCδ mediated its inhibitory effect on the expression of the astrocytic marker GS (23Brodie C. Bogi K. Acs P. Lorenzo P.S. Baskin L. Blumberg P.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 30713-30718Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). To characterize the effect of PKCδ on C6 cell proliferation we first examined the relative contributions of the regulatory and catalytic domains of this isoform. For these studies, we used chimeras between the regulatory and catalytic domains of PKCα, -δ, and -ε, combined at the highly conserved hinge region. The expression and activity of C6 cells overexpressing the different chimeras were already described previously (23Brodie C. Bogi K. Acs P. Lorenzo P.S. Baskin L. Blumberg P.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 30713-30718Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). Cells were pretreated for 24 h with ZnCl2, followed by PMA treatment (20 nm) for an additional 48 h. This concentration of PMA induced prolonged activation of PKCδ without marked down-regulation. Cells overexpressing PKCδ/δ exhibited a lower rate of cell proliferation than control cells. In contrast, cells overexpressing PKCα/α and ε/ε exhibited a higher rate of cell proliferation than controls both in the presence and absence of PMA. Similar to cells expressing PKCδ/δ, cells overexpressing the chimeras containing the regulatory domain of PKCδ, namely δ/α and δ/ε, also showed a reduced level of cell proliferation, whereas cells expressing chimeras containing the catalytic domain of PKCδ together with the regulatory domain of PKCα or -ε exhibited an increased level of proliferation similar to that observed with cells expressing PKCα/α or PKCε/ε (Fig.1 A). Untreated cells overexpressing PKCδ/δ or chimeras containing the regulatory domain of PKCδ also showed decreased cell proliferation as compared with control vector cells, but the magnitude of this decrease was much lower than that observed in PMA-treated cells (Fig. 1 A). We reported that the expression of the PKCδ5 mutant (in which tyrosines 52, 64, 155, 187, and 565 were mutated to phenylalanine) in C6 cells abolished the decrease in the expression of the astrocytic marker GS induced by PMA or PDGF. Expression of the PKCδ5 mutant also resulted in a lower tyrosine phosphorylation of PKCδ in response to these treatments (23Brodie C. Bogi K. Acs P. Lorenzo P.S. Baskin L. Blumberg P.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 30713-30718Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). Using cells expressing PKCδ5 we found that in response to PMA (20 nm) these cells displayed enhanced proliferation as compared with vector control cells, contrasting with cells overexpressing PKCδ WT which exhibited a significantly lower proliferative response (Fig. 1 B). Similar results were obtained when the proliferation of C6 cells expressing PKCδ and PKCδ5 was followed over the course of 5 days (data not shown). To identify the specific tyrosines that are involved in the inhibitory effect of PKCδ on cell proliferation and GS expression, we examined the role of tyrosines 52, 155,and 187, which were already reported to be phosphorylated in other systems (25Li W. Li W. Chen X.-H. Kelley C.A. Alimandi M. Zhang J. Chen Q. Bottaro D.P. Pierce J.H. J. Biol.

Biochem. Cell Biol. 1995; 214: 888-894Google Scholar). C6 cells were stably transfected with PKCδ mutants in which one of these three tyrosines was mutated to phenylalanine. Fig. 2 A illustrates a representative Western blot of C6 cells overexpressing PKCδ, PKCδ5, PKCδY155F, PKCδY187F, and PKCδY52F mutants, and the vector control. Using the previously described tagging system (44Olah Z. Lehel C. Jakab G. Anderson W.B. Anal. Biochem. 1994; 221: 94-102Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar), we were able to detect specifically the transfected PKC isoforms using an antibody against the PKCε epitope tag on the constructs. The levels of the overexpressed PKCδ WT and the PKCδ mutants in the transfected cells we used were 8–10-fold higher than the endogenous PKCδ as determined using an anti-PKCδ specific antibody (data not shown). Cells overexpressing PKCδ or the PKCδ mutants expressed similar levels of PKCα, -β, -γ, -ε, -η, -θ, -ζ, and -μ (data not shown), thus excluding the possibility that the different effects of PKCδ, and the PKCδ mutants were indirectly mediated by changes in the expression of the other PKC isoforms. To establish that the overexpressed PKCδ mutants were functionally active, we measured kinase activity on cell lysates. All PKCδ mutants expressed higher kinase activity as compared with the control vector cells (Fig.2 B). The degree of tyrosine phosphorylation of the various PKCδ mutants was examined in response to PMA and PDGF. As illustrated in Fig. 3, a small basal level of tyrosine phosphorylation was observed in untreated cells. PMA and PDGF induced marked tyrosine phosphorylation of PKCδ WT but, as already described, no significant degree of enhanced tyrosine phosphorylation of PKCδ5 (p > 0.07, n = 5). The degree of tyrosine phosphorylation of PKCδY155F and PKCδY187F in response to PMA was intermediate between that of PKCδ WT and that of the PKCδ5 mutant, suggesting that both tyrosines 155 and 187 are being phosphorylated in response to PMA. In contrast, cells overexpressing PKCδY52F exhibited a level of tyrosine phosphorylation similar to that of PKCδ WT, suggesting that this tyrosine may not be phosphorylated in response to PMA. As already described, PDGF also induced tyrosine phosphorylation of PKCδ and this effect was abolished in the PKCδ5 cells. We found that treatment of cells overexpressing PKCδY187F with PDGF resulted in a very low tyrosine phosphorylation of PKCδ. In contrast, PDGF-stimulated cells overexpressing PKCδY155F or PKCδY52F exhibited similar levels of tyrosine phosphorylation to those observed in cells overexpressing PKCδ WT. We then examined the degree of cell proliferation and GS expression in cells overexpressing the different PKC mutants. We found that, in response to PMA, cells overexpressing PKCδY155F displayed an increased cell proliferation over control vector expressing cells and significantly increased proliferation compared with cells overexpressing PKCδ WT (Fig.4 A). Interestingly, the degree of cell proliferation in the PKCδY155F cells was similar to that obtained with the PKCδ5 overexpressing cells. In contrast, cells overexpressing the PKCδY187F or PKCδY52F mutant exhibited a reduced degree of cell proliferation as compared with vector control cells and were similar to cells overexpressing PKCδ WT. The effects of the PKCδ mutants were also examined on the expression of GS in response to PDGF. Cells were pretreated for 24 h with ZnCl2 and then with PDGF (100 ng/ml) for an additional 48 h. As described previously, cells overexpressing PKCδ WT exhibited lower levels of GS expression upon PDGF treatments, whereas cells overexpressing PKCδ5 exhibited increased levels of GS compared with vector control cells. Cells overexpressing PKCδY155F or PKCδY52F exhibited lower GS expression in PDGF-treated cells similar to the level obtained in cells overexpressing PKCδ WT. Opposite results were obtained in cells overexpressing PKCδY187F. These cells exhibited an increased expression of GS in response to stimulation with PDGF, similar to the results obtained in cells overexpressing PKCδ5 (Fig. 4 B). Similar results with the mutants were obtained in cells treated with 20 nm PMA (data not shown). One possible explanation for the differential effect of the mutants on cell proliferation and GS expression is translocation to different cellular compartments following stimulation. We therefore examined the translocation of the different PKCδ mutants in response to PMA and PDGF. For these experiments we used GFP-tagged PKCδ WT or the different PKCδ mutants. Cells were transiently transfected with the specific GFP-PKCδ mutants, and the response of the cells to PMA or PDGF was monitored over a period of 30 min. Stimulation of the cells with 100 nm PMA induced initial translocation of PKCδ to the plasma membrane followed by some translocation of PKCδ to the perinuclear membrane (Fig. 5). PDGF also induced translocation of PKCδ, but the magnitude of this translocation was much lower than that induced by PMA. PDGF induced some membranal translocation of PKCδ and distribution of PKCδ around the perinuclear membrane (Fig. 5). A similar pattern of translocation was observed for PKCδ and the PKCδ mutants in response to PMA (Fig. 6) and PDGF (data not shown). Thus, PMA induced translocation of the PKCδ mutants to both the plasma membrane and the perinuclear membrane (Fig. 6). The kinetics of the translocation as well as the response to lower concentrations of PMA were likewise similar in all of the mutants (data not shown). PMA or PDGF did not induce any changes in cells overexpressing GFP protein alone (data not shown).Figure 6Cellular localization of PKC δ and the PKC δ mutants in PMA-treated C6 cells. Cells were transiently transfected with GFP-PKCδ or the different GFP-PKCδ mutants. Following 48 h, cells were treated with PMA (100 nm), and sequential confocal images were taken every 30 s for a period of 30 min. The figures present images taken at time 0 (−PMA) and 30 min (+PMA) after treatment.

Since the inhibitory effects of PMA on GS expression and cell proliferation require a prolonged exposure of the cells to PMA, we examined whether the various PKCδ mutants exhibit different degrees of degradation as compared with PKCδ WT.

The mutant HMMs were characterized kinetically and mechanically, with emphasis on measurements of unitary displacements and forces in the laser trap assay. Two shorter necked constructs had smaller unitary step sizes and moved actin more slowly than WT HMM in the motility assay. A longer necked construct that contained an additional essential light chain binding site exhibited a 1.4-fold increase in the unitary step size compared with its control. Kinetic changes were also observed with several of the constructs. The mutant lacking a neck produced force at a somewhat reduced level, while the force exerted by the giraffe construct was higher than control. The single molecule displacement and force data support the hypothesis that the neck functions as a rigid lever, with the fulcrum for movement and force located at a point within the motor domain.

A simple mechanistic model by which myosin could move actin was proposed based on the crystal structure of skeletal myosin subfragment 1 (1Rayment I. Rypniewski W.R. Schmidt-Base K. Smith R.

J. 1995; 68: 19S-26SPubMed Google Scholar). The key feature was an 8.5-nm single α-helix, stabilized by the essential and regulatory light chains (ELC and RLC),1 which formed an elongated neck region that emerged from the globular motor domain. It was suggested that a substantial portion of the myosin motor domain maintains a fixed orientation when attached to actin, while the neck region pivots about a fulcrum within the motor domain, thus generating a power stroke. Additional evidence in support of a lever arm rotation was obtained from the crystal structure of a motor domain-essential light chain complex with a transition state analog at the active site, which showed the lever arm in a second position that may represent myosin in the prepowerstroke state (4Dominguez R. Freyzon Y. Trybus K.M. Cohen C. Cell. 1998; 94: 559-571Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (591) Google Scholar). The skeletal subfragment 1 structure is likely to resemble the structure adopted at the end of the powerstroke. A comparison of the two conformations shows that smaller changes that originate at the active site are amplified into much larger movements of the lever arm. This motion could accommodate a powerstroke on the order of 10 nm, in the range of the 5–15 nm of displacement measured using single molecule techniques (5Finer J.T. Simmons R.M. Spudich J.A.

Nature. 1999; 397: 129-134Crossref PubMed Scopus (424) Google Scholar). The simplest mechanical model for the neck region predicts that myosin with a shorter neck (i.e. shorter lever arm) should generate smaller unitary displacements and move actin more slowly, whereas a longer neck should lead to larger displacements and more rapid actin movement (reviewed in Ref. 9Block S. Cell. 1996; 87: 151-157Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). Several studies in which myosins of various neck lengths were produced either by removing light chains (10Lowey S. Waller G.S. Trybus K.M. Nature. 1993; 365: 454-456Crossref PubMed Scopus (268) Google Scholar, 11Trybus K.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 20819-20822Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) or by genetically adding or deleting light chain binding sites (12Uyeda T.Q.P. Spudich J.A. Science. 1993; 262: 1867-1870Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar, 13Uyeda T.Q. Abramson P.D. Spudich J.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. 1996; 93: 4459-4464Crossref PubMed Scopus (392) Google Scholar) showed that constructs with necks shorter than wild type moved actin more slowly, while a construct with a longer neck moved actin more quickly. A chimera in which two α-actinin repeats were fused to the Dictyostelium motor domain showed a higher average velocity than a similar construct with only one α-actinin repeat, suggesting that nonnative structures can mimic some aspects of the native neck (14Anson M Geeves M.A. Kurzawa S.E. Manstein D.J. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 6069-6074Crossref PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar). Although these studies are consistent with a simple lever arm model, they all relied on the assumption that no kinetic changes resulted from these biochemical or genetic perturbations. Since velocity in the motility assay,v max, is dependent upon both step size (d) and the time spent attached to actin following the powerstroke (t on) (i.e. v max ≅d/t on) (15Huxley H.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 8347-8350Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), changes in either parameter could equally well account for the observed differences in motility. Here we test the lever arm hypothesis at the single molecule level by measuring the displacement (d) and force (F) of a series of smooth muscle heavy meromyosin (HMM) mutants in which light chain binding sites were either added to or deleted from the neck. The laser trap data support the hypothesis that the neck acts as a lever and are consistent with structural data that suggest that the fulcrum for movement and force is located near the SH1 helix (4Dominguez R. Freyzon Y. Trybus K.M. Cohen C. Cell. 1998; 94: 559-571Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (591) Google Scholar). Wild type (WT) smooth muscle HMM (amino acids 1–1175) and neck length mutants of this heavy chain backbone were co-expressed with the regulatory and essential light chains using the baculovirus insect cell expression system (11Trybus K.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 20819-20822Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The HMM backbone was chosen as the basis for the different neck-length constructs so that monoclonal anti-rod antibody S2.2 could be used as a common means of attaching the molecules to the nitrocellulose substratum for both motility and laser trap studies. Proteins were purified by binding to actin and release with MgATP as described previously (11Trybus K.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 20819-20822Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Two constructs with neck lengths shorter than WT HMM were cloned (see Fig. 1). An HMM with no light chain binding region (“neckless”) had heavy chain residues 791–848 deleted. This resulted in a dimeric construct with the motor domain attached to the rod. The sequence of the region joining the motor domain to the rod in the neckless construct was ERDLGPLLQV. An HMM mutant lacking an RLC binding site (“-R site”) had amino acids 820–848 deleted. The sequence of the joining region in this construct, which contains the motor domain and ELC binding site attached to the rod, was QQQLLGPLLQV.Figure 1Schematic diagram of the constructs used in this study.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) A long necked mutant (“giraffe”) in which a second ELC binding site was added between the native ELC and RLC binding sites was also cloned (Fig. 1). This mutant retains native contacts between the motor domain and the ELC and between the ELC and the RLC but introduces a foreign ELC-ELC interaction. The following sequence was introduced between Leu819 and Thr820: LGITDVIIAFQAQCRGYLARKAFAKRQQQL. This sequence is LG plus amino acids 792–819. To test if the orientation of the two ELCs with respect to each other influences the properties of the giraffe construct, a second variation was constructed (“giraffe's twisted sister”). This revised construct had one less amino acid in the added ELC site than the previous construct; thus, the two ELCs would be rotated by approximately 100°. This was accomplished by inserting the sequence of amino acids 791–819 (i.e. KITDVIIAFQAQCRGYLARKAFAKRQQQL) between Leu819 and Thr820. A phosphorylation-independent variant of giraffe HMM was also engineered. Based on earlier studies, substitution of the 50/20-kDa β-cardiac actin binding loop (CABL) for the native sequence (residues 626–653) activated unphosphorylated smooth muscle HMM (16Rovner A.S. Freyzon Y. Trybus K.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 30260-30263Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). Thus, the double mutants, CABL-giraffe and CABL-giraffe's twisted sister, were also constructed. The movement of these constructs was more consistent than the original giraffe construct, and thus the single-molecule studies could be more readily performed. Unphosphorylated CABL-HMM with a native neck was used as the control for the unphosphorylated long necked CABL-giraffe. Actin-activated ATPase assays were performed in 10 mm imidazole, pH 7, 8 mm KCl, 1 mmMgCl2, 1 mm EGTA, 1 mmdithiothreitol, 1 mm NaN3 at 37 °C. Inorganic phosphate was determined colorimetrically at six time points per actin concentration, using SDS to stop the reaction (17White H.D. Methods Enzymol. 1982; 85: 698-708Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar). The concentration of active heads was determined by NH4+-ATPase activity relative to a myosin standard (25 mm Tris, pH 7.5, at 37 °C, 0.4m NH4Cl, 2 mm EDTA, 0.2m sucrose, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 1 mg/ml bovine serum albumin). Rotary-shadowed platinum images were obtained in 0.5 m ammonium acetate, 66% glycerol and observed with a Philips EM301 electron microscope operated at 60 kV (18Trybus K.M. Lowey S. J. Biol. Chem. 1984; 259: 8564-8571Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Actin was decorated with the expressed constructs, negatively stained, and observed over holes on carbon-coated grids (19Craig R. Szent-Gyorgyi A.G. Beese L. Flicker P. Vibert P. Cohen C. J. Mol. Biol. 1980; 140: 35-55Crossref PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar). The motility assay was performed at 30 °C in 25 mm imidazole, pH 7.5, 25 mm KCl, 4 mm MgCl2, 1 mm EGTA, 0.5% methylcellulose, as described by Trybus and Chatman (20Trybus K.M. Chatman T.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 4412-4419Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). CABL-giraffe was also assayed at a higher ionic strength in 25 mmimidazole, pH 7.5, 60 mm KCl, 4 mmMgCl2, 1 mm EGTA, 0.7% methylcellulose. Monoclonal anti-rod antibody S2.2 was used to ensure a uniform site of attachment to the nitrocellulose surface (21Trybus K.M. Henry L. J. Cell Biol. 1989; 109: 2879-2886Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). Fifteen or more filaments were used to calculate the mean and S.D. of the velocity of movement. The average velocity for a given filament was calculated by dividing the distance traveled by the filament during a 1-s period between video snapshots for 7–15 consecutive snapshots as described previously (22Work S.S. Warshaw D.M. Anal. Biochem. 1992; 202: 275-285Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). To control for sporadic motility potentially compromising the velocity estimate, velocities for a paired preparation of CABL-HMM and CABL-giraffe were determined without averaging over numerous short intervals (1 s) and then plotted in a histogram (see Fig. 4 C). Technical details of our laser trap techniques have been published elsewhere (7Guilford W.H. Dupuis D.E. Kennedy G. Wu J. Patlak J.B. Warshaw D.M. Biophys. J. 1997; 72: 1006-1021Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (223) Google Scholar, 23Dupuis D.E. Guilford W.H. Wu J. Warshaw D.M. J. Muscle Res.

Cell Motil. 1998; 19: 825-837Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar). Briefly, a pair of 1-μm polystyrene microspheres coated withN-ethylmaleimide-modified myosin were held in solution using two independent laser traps. A fluorescently labeled (tetramethylrhodamine isothiocyanate-phalloidin) actin filament was strung between the two microspheres and pulled taut (>4 piconewtons). The actin filament is then lowered onto the surface of a 2.0-μm diameter silica bead adhered to a coverslip. The silica bead acts as a platform on which a sparse coating of HMM is applied, so that on average only one HMM molecule interacts with the actin filament at any time. HMM was adhered to the nitrocellulose-coated surface through an anti-subfragment 2 antibody applied at 100 μg/ml (21Trybus K.M. Henry L. J. Cell Biol. 1989; 109: 2879-2886Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar) before surface blocking with bovine serum albumin (500 μg/ml). HMM was then applied in concentrations varying from 2.5–10 μg/ml and allowed to bind to the antibody for 2 min. Thus, HMM was bound to the surface with random orientation but at a defined point on the molecule. All experiments were performed at low ionic strength (25 mmKCl), limiting ATP concentration (10 μm), and 25 °C, to prolong the unitary event durations. To measure the displacements imparted to the actin filament by a single HMM molecule, the bright field image of one of the microsphere handles is projected onto a quadrant photodiode detector, providingx and y bead position data. Myosin's unitary displacements were recorded under “unloaded” conditions (0.02–0.04 piconewtons/nm/trap). To measure force, a nearly isometric condition was obtained under feedback control by increasing the effective trap stiffness approximately 100-fold. The feedback loop contained an acousto-optic modulator, which was used to deflect the laser trap and thus counterbalance the myosin-generated forces (7Guilford W.H. Dupuis D.E. Kennedy G. Wu J. Patlak J.B. Warshaw D.M. Biophys. J. 1997; 72: 1006-1021Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (223) Google Scholar). The acousto-optic modulator control signal was calibrated and served as the force signal. Force measurements in this assay may not represent the true maximum unitary force due to compliance in the actin filament-bead attachment and the low bandwidth of the feedback system (i.e. ∼140 Hz). Although the forces measured are surely underestimates, they are still meaningful for comparative purposes across mutants. The technique of “mean-variance” (MV) analysis (25Patlak J.B. Biophys. J. 1993; 65: 29-42Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar) was used to derive estimates of force and displacement from the laser trap data. MV analysis begins with a model-independent transformation of the time record, thus giving an alternative view of the data (a MV histogram), which emphasizes intervals of constant properties within the data. Generation of the MV histogram requires no assumptions about or interpretation of the underlying data, and quantitative descriptions of the data are derived from curve fits to the histogram. Thus, MV analysis is less prone to the biases introduced by manual scoring methods and may be used to estimate the size (i.e. d and F), distribution, number, and duration of events (t on) in the data as described previously (7Guilford W.H. Dupuis D.E. Kennedy G. Wu J. Patlak J.B. Warshaw D.M. Biophys. J. 1997; 72: 1006-1021Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (223) Google Scholar, 24Lauzon A.-M. Tyska M.J. Rovner A.S. Freyzon Y. Warshaw D.M. Trybus K.M. J. Muscle Res. Cell Motil. 1998; 19: 825-837Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar). Two double-headed constructs with neck lengths shorter than that of wild type HMM were engineered and expressed in the baculovirus/insect cell system (Fig. 1). One construct lacked an RLC binding site (-R site), and SDS-gels confirmed that this construct did not bind RLC (Fig. 2 C). The second shorter necked construct lacked both an RLC and an ELC binding site (neckless). Metal-shadowed images showed that the two globular domains closely abut the rod, as would be expected from a neckless construct that lacked the light chain binding domain (Fig.2 A). These characterizations, as well as the functional assays that follow, are necessary to ensure that the constructs that are analyzed in the laser trap retain certain essential and characteristic features of myosin. To assess if the mutations altered the kinetics of the cross-bridge cycle, actin-activated ATPase measurements were performed. Since both shorter necked constructs lacked the RLC, these molecules did not require phosphorylation for activation. The actin-activated ATPase activity of -R site (open squares) and neckless (filled triangles) was similar to that of phosphorylated WT HMM (filled circles) (Fig.3 A). The mutants were also tested by an in vitro motility assay, which serves as a simplified model system to assess the motion-generating capacity of myosin at the molecular level. Both shorter necked constructs moved actin more slowly than WT HMM. The neckless construct moved actin at ∼25% of the velocity (0.26 ± 0.04 μm/s) of phosphorylated WT HMM (1.1 ± 0.19 μm/s), while -R site moved actin at ∼45% the rate (0.49 ± 0.18 μm/s) of phosphorylated WT HMM (Fig.4 A). To understand the molecular basis for the differences in actin filament velocities between the various constructs, the mechanical and kinetic properties of these constructs were characterized in the laser trap. At the single molecule level, actin filament velocity (v max) is related tod, the unitary displacement generated by myosin during the powerstroke, and t on, the time spent attached to actin following the powerstroke by the equationv max ≅d/t on. Estimates of d andt on were obtained for the mutants and compared with WT HMM by analyzing displacement time series data obtained in the laser trap assay (Fig. 5). Displacement records were characterized by periods of Brownian noise in which HMM-generated displacement events were interspersed. The Brownian noise is reduced upon attachment of HMM to actin (5Finer J.T. Simmons R.M. Spudich J.A. Nature. 1994; 368: 113-119Crossref PubMed Scopus (1583) Google Scholar, 6Molloy J.E. Burns J.E.

This approach becomes a critical tool particularly for analyzing records from shorter necked mutants, which generate displacement events that are small in amplitude and well within the Brownian noise of the system. Based on this analysis, neckless generated an average displacement of 2.0 nm, significantly smaller than the 10.5-nm displacement obtained with WT HMM. The -R site mutant, which has half the neck length of WT HMM, also produced smaller displacements (d = 6.2 nm) than WT HMM (Figs. 5 and 6 and TableI). The d values obtained here for WT HMM are similar to those previously reported for smooth muscle myosin as well as expressed WT HMM under similar conditions (7Guilford W.H. Dupuis D.E. Kennedy G.

The values for all laser trap parameters are expressed as the mean ± S.E. For these data, nindicates the number of independent data sets analyzed by MV analysis (see “Experimental Procedures”). ND, not determined. Unitary forces were also recorded (Fig. 5, Table I). The appearance of force events within the time series data was similar to that of displacement events and thus analyzed by MV analysis. The neckless construct generated forces that were somewhat lower than that of WT HMM (∼1.1 versus ∼1.6 piconewtons, respectively). If the lever arm model appropriately describes the mechanical properties of the neck region, then a longer neck should result in larger unitary displacements. Therefore, a longer necked “giraffe” construct with an additional ELC binding site was expressed. This type of construct is a more stringent test of the lever arm hypothesis (Fig. 1), given that a gain rather than a loss in function is expected. Visual inspection of giraffe HMM by metal-shadowing showed that the construct appeared normal except for having an apparently longer neck region (Fig. 2 A). In addition, the construct decorated actin in a regular manner, suggesting that its actin-binding properties were intact (Fig. 2 B). The ratio of ELC/RLC was 1.7–1.9 times larger in the giraffe construct compared with WT HMM (average slope from four gel loadings, two independent preparations), consistent within experimental error with the construct containing an additional ELC binding site. However, despite having actin-activated ATPase activity, less than half of the actin filaments moved in the motility assay, and they moved at a rate at least 2-fold slower than phosphorylated WT HMM. The rates of motility were 0.49 ± 0.13 μm/s for phosphorylated giraffe HMM and 0.23 ± 0.04 μm/s for unphosphorylated giraffe HMM. The addition of exogenous ELC to the preparation had no effect on motility. When three independent preparations of the phosphorylated giraffe HMM were used in an attempt to obtain unitary displacement data, the data were of insufficient quality to perform the MV analysis. Given that smooth muscle myosin's ability to move actin is strictly dependent on light chain phosphorylation, we hypothesized that light chain phosphorylation was not able to fully activate the giraffe HMM construct. If this is true, then a constitutively active mutant that contains the same elongated neck region as the “wild type” giraffe construct should circumvent the problem of poor motility. We had previously shown that mutation of the actin-binding loop to the sequence found in cardiac myosin produced a constitutively active molecule (16Rovner A.S. Freyzon Y. Trybus K.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 30260-30263Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar), and thus we expressed a long necked mutant, CABL-giraffe, that was active even when unphosphorylated (see “Experimental Procedures”). CABL-HMM with a native neck served as the control. Both constructs were analyzed in the unphosphorylated state. The actin-activated ATPase of CABL-giraffe (filled triangles) (V max = 6.7 ± 0.6 s−1, K m = 6 ± 3 μm) was slightly more than twice than of CABL-HMM (filled circles) (V max = 2.9 ± 0.3 s−1, K m = 16 ± 5 μm) (Fig. 3 B). This result shows that the kinetics of the interaction with actin have been altered by the mutation in the neck. When four independent preparations of CABL-giraffe were compared in parallel with CABL-HMM, there were no significant differences in motility, as would have been predicted from a simple lever arm model (Fig. 4 B). One pair of preparations (Fig. 4 B,1) was also analyzed by determining the velocities during 1-s intervals instead of obtaining an average velocity for a longer run, but still no significant differences emerged (Fig. 4 C). This similarity in rates held true under standard motility conditions (25 mm KCl) as well as at higher salt concentrations (60 mm KCl). As previously reported, unphosphorylated CABL-HMM moved actin at ∼50% the rate of phosphorylated WT HMM, and phosphorylation of CABL-HMM had only a slight effect, increasing this value to ∼75% that of phosphorylated WT HMM (16Rovner A.S. Freyzon Y. Trybus K.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 30260-30263Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). A second long necked construct, CABL-giraffe's twisted sister (see “Experimental Procedures”) was expressed in order to test if the relative orientation of the two ELCs had an impact on the rate of motility. The motility observed with this construct was 0.54 ± 0.07 μm/s (number of filaments = 26). This is within the range of values observed for both CABL-HMM and the original CABL-giraffe construct (0.36–0.55 μm/s; see Fig. 4). Despite the fact that CABL-giraffe did not show an increased velocity in the in vitro motility assay (Table I), it is still possible that its unitary displacements could be larger. This in fact proved to be the case. CABL-giraffe generated an average displacement of 12.4 nm, 1.4-fold greater than its control, CABL-HMM, which produced 9.1-nm steps. The mutation at the actin binding loop did not affect step size per se, since the 9.1-nm step of CABL-HMM is statistically indistinguishable from the 10.5-nm unitary step size of WT HMM. The t on for CABL-giraffe was marginally longer than for its control CABL-HMM, but both CABL constructs have significantly shorter values than obtained for WT HMM. Unitary forces produced by CABL-giraffe were approximately twice that generated by CABL-HMM (Table I). Given the higher force-generating capacity of the CABL-giraffe, it is unlikely that the addition of an ELC site introduced a significant compliance within the neck, which potentially could have explained why the rate of motility of CABL-giraffe was not faster than its control CABL-HMM. The goal of this study was to provide a stringent test for whether the myosin neck region acts as a mechanical lever that transmits force and displacements originating within the motor domain. We therefore characterized the molecular mechanics of smooth muscle HMM mutants with shorter and longer neck regions by measuring in vitromotility velocities, unitary displacements, and unitary forces. If the neck acts as a simple lever arm, one prediction is that under unloaded conditions in the laser trap, the magnitude of d should be directly related to lever arm length. Unitary displacements of two short necked constructs were 20% (neckless) and 60% (-R site) of the values obtained with WT HMM. Strikingly, the long necked giraffe mutant generated displacements that were 1.4 times that of its control. The relationship between unitary displacements and lever arm length is linear, strongly supporting the hypothesis that the neck acts as a lever arm (Fig. 6). Another conclusion of this study is that the lever must extend into the motor domain, since our neckless mutant generated significant force and motion. Motion was also observed for other neckless myosin species created genetically in Dictyostelium myosin (27Itakura S. Yamakawa H. Toyoshima Y.Y. Ishijima A. Kojima T. Harada Y. Yanagida T. Wakabayashi T. Sutoh K. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1993; 196: 1504-1510Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar) or proteolytically from skeletal muscle myosin (28Waller G.S Ouyang G. Swafford J. Vibert P. Lowey S. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 15348-15352Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). The portion of the long α-helix that remains in the neckless construct (residues 778–790), which abuts the more compact domain of the converter region (residues 721–777), could provide an additional piece of lever arm for generating force and motion in this construct. The crystal structures of skeletal subfragment 1 and smooth muscle MDE show that the rotation of the converter and the lever arm occurs because of two perpendicular rotations around two conserved glycines that are located at either end of the SH1 helix (4Dominguez R. Freyzon Y. Trybus K.M. Cohen C. Cell. 1998; 94: 559-571Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (591) Google Scholar). In agreement with the structural data, the correlation between neck length and d (Fig. 6) suggests that the fulcrum for movement is ∼3 nm within the motor domain. Therefore, the bulk of the motor domain remains in a relatively fixed orientation with respect to actin, and the point at which myosin undergoes a major rotation is closer to the converter region than to the actomyosin interface. The lever hypothesis also makes specific predictions about the relationship between lever arm length (L) and unitary force (see Fig. 7), but these are model-dependent. In contrast, all three models described below predict a linear relationship between lever arm length and unitary displacement (Fig. 6). Our data showed that neckless generated somewhat less force than WT HMM, while the giraffe construct generated more force than its control. These data rule out the simplest lever arm model, which would have force inversely related to L. A second model, suggested by Howard and Spudich (Appendix in 13), proposed that the neck region acts more like an elastic cantilever rather than a rigid lever and predicts that force (F) should be inversely related to L 2. Our data also do not fit this model, which was recently used to explain changes in x-ray diffraction intensity data with small changes in muscle length (29Dobbie I. Linari M. Piazzesi G. Reconditi M. Koubassova N. Ferenczi M.A. Lombardi V. Irving M. Nature. 1998; 396: 383-387Crossref PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar), where the intensity changes were assumed to be the result of both a rotation and bending of the neck region. A third mechanical model, that we previously proposed to explain the force- and motion-generating capacity of light chain-deficient skeletal muscle myosins (10Lowey S. Waller G.S. Trybus K.M. Nature. 1993; 365: 454-456Crossref PubMed Scopus (268) Google Scholar, 30VanBuren P. Waller G.S. Harris D.E. Trybus K.M. Warshaw D.M. Lowey S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. 1994; 91: 12403-12407Crossref PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar), predicts that force should be linearly related to L. In this model, a torque generated in the motor domain produces force at the end of the neck, which acts as a rigid lever. This force would then stretch an elastic element, presumably in the subfragment 2 region (30VanBuren P. Waller G.S. Harris D.E. Trybus K.M. Warshaw D.M. Lowey S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. 1994; 91: 12403-12407Crossref PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar). A comparison of the force data from the laser trap with the predictions for the three models (see Fig. 7) suggests that the third model may be the most appropriate. Both the displacement and the force data support the conclusion that the neck region acts as a rigid lever and that much of the myosin elasticity is external to the neck. It should be noted that force measurements in this assay are underestimates, given the stray compliances within the experimental system (see “Experimental Procedures”), and thus conclusions based on these data should be viewed in light of this concern. An alternative view of the neck has been championed by Yanagida and co-workers (31Tanaka H. Kitamura K. Iwane E.H. Yanagida T. Biophys. J. 2000; 78 (abstr.): 3AGoogle Scholar). Although they also obtained a reduced velocity with a similar neckless construct of Dictyostelium myosin, they showed that the unitary step size was unaffected by the change in neck length and therefore concluded that the slower velocity was due only to an increase in the time of attachment following the powerstroke (31Tanaka H. Kitamura K. Iwane E.H. Yanagida T. Biophys. J. 2000; 78 (abstr.): 3AGoogle Scholar). This view favors the idea that the neck region serves to regulate the kinetics of the cross-bridge cycle. In contrast, our unitary displacement data support the idea that the neck acts as a mechanical lever arm. However, we also have evidence that kinetic changes have occurred with several of the neck length constructs, both in the unitary event durations (Table I) and in steady-state actin-activated ATPase activity (Fig. 3 B). Thus, the assumption thatton remains constant and that all changes in velocity are due to changes in unitary displacement (v max ≅d/t on), which was made in several previous studies with altered neck length mutants (12Uyeda T.Q.P. Spudich J.A. Science. 1993; 262: 1867-1870Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar, 13Uyeda T.Q. Abramson P.D. Spudich J.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. 1996; 93: 4459-4464Crossref PubMed Scopus (392) Google Scholar, 14Anson M Geeves M.A. Kurzawa S.E. Manstein D.J. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 6069-6074Crossref PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar), is probably not justified. For example, CABL-giraffe moved actin at the same rate as its control, CABL-HMM, although the step size was increased, in contrast to a previous study, which reported that a long necked myosin showed faster motility than WT myosin (13Uyeda T.Q. Abramson P.D. Spudich J.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. 1996; 93: 4459-4464Crossref PubMed Scopus (392) Google Scholar). A kinetic contribution to changes in velocity because of neck alterations has also been inferred from several previous studies. Changes in the unloaded duty cycle contributed to the reduced velocity and force production of ELC-deficient myosin (30VanBuren P. Waller G.S. Harris D.E. Trybus K.M. Warshaw D.M. Lowey S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. 1994; 91: 12403-12407Crossref PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar). Point mutations in the RLC have been shown to affect in vitro motility rates although ATPase activity remains high (32Chaudoir B.M. Kowalczyk P.A. Chisholm R.L. J. Cell Sci. 1999; 112: 1611-1620PubMed Google Scholar). Finally, a RLC point mutant, with weakened divalent cation binding, modulates the kinetics of cross-bridge attachment and detachment (33Diffee G.M. Patel J.R. Reinach F.C. Greaser M.L. Moss R.L. Biophys. J. 1996; 71: 341-350Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). Assuming that the unitary step size was unchanged by this point mutation, these data also argue for the potential modulation of velocity via kinetic mechanisms as a result of structural perturbations to the neck. We conclude that changes in the length of the light chain binding domain affect the unitary displacement and force of both shorter and longer necked constructs in a way that is consistent with the neck acting as a lever arm. The fulcrum for the rotation is located ∼3 nm internal to the C-terminal end of the motor domain, far from the actomyosin interface. Perturbations to the neck region also appear to modulate the kinetics of several constructs, as judged by changes in steady state ATPase activity and by changes in the unitary displacement event durations. It is possible that kinetic changes are accentuated in these smooth muscle myosin constructs, where myosin activity is tightly regulated by light chain phosphorylation. Thus, the neck region acts as a lever arm but may also serve to transmit mechanical strain to the catalytic site within the motor domain.

Although the allosteric control is an essential feature of its action as a signal transducer, it has been revealed that an additional two types of control are also important as follows: one is phosphorylation of kinases themselves (2Peterson R.T.

The PKC family has three conserved in vivo phosphorylation sites as follows: the activation loop site and two sites located C-terminal to the kinase domain (6Keranen L.M. Dutil E.M. Newton A.C. Curr.

It has been found that the activation loop site of PKC as well as other kinases such as PKB and p70S6K is phosphorylated by phosphoinositide-dependent protein kinase 1 (PDK1) (12Belham C. Wu S.

For instance, phosphorylation of PKB is triggered by translocation to the membrane through binding its pleckstrin homology domain with phosphatidylinositol-(3,4,5)-triphosphate, causing a conformational change that exposes the activation loop phosphorylation site (17Stephens L. Anderson K. Stokoe D. Erdjument B.H. Painter G.F. Holmes A.B. Gaffney P.R. Reese C.B. McCormick F. Tempst P. Coadwell J. Hawkins P.T. Science. 1998; 279: 710-714Crossref PubMed Scopus (911) Google Scholar). It is likely that the PKC family is also recruited to the particular place through binding with lipid or with anchoring proteins to receive phosphorylation. We have previously reported that CG-NAP (centrosome andGolgi localized PKN- associatedprotein) serves as an anchoring protein for protein kinases (PKN and PKA) and protein phosphatases (PP1 and PP2A) at centrosome and the Golgi apparatus (18Takahashi M.

Among PKC isozymes, PKCε was demonstrated to be localized to the Golgi apparatus when expressed in NIH3T3 cells (19Lehel C. Olah Z. Jakab G. Anderson W.B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 1406-1410Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar). Therefore, we examined whether PKCε associates with CG-NAP. In this study we have found that immature non- or hypophosphorylated PKCε associates with CG-NAP at Golgi/centrosome area, and sufficiently phosphorylated PKCε dissociates from CG-NAP as a “mature” PKCε responsive to the incoming second messenger signals, suggesting that CG-NAP serves as a protein scaffold for the phosphorylation of PKCε.

After centrifugation, cleared lysates were incubated with an appropriate antibody at 4 °C for 2 h, and then protein A-Sepharose (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) was added and incubated for a further 30 min. The resin was washed with the same buffer, and then the bound proteins were processed for immunoblotting (22Mukai H. Ono Y. Biochem. Cell Biol. 1994; 199: 897-904Google Scholar) or kinase assay. Rat brain was homogenized by Dounce homogenizer in the Lysis Buffer and then centrifuged at 100,000 × g for 20 min. Cleared lysates were used as brain extracts. COS7 cells transiently expressing HA-PKCε were incubated in methionine/cysteine-free medium containing 5% dialyzed FBS for 2 h and then pulse-labeled for 5 min with [35S]methionine/cysteine (10.4 MBq/ml). The cells were further incubated in the medium containing 10% FBS, cold methionine (90 μg/ml), and cysteine (210 μg/ml) for 0, 15, 30, 60, and 120 min. After washing with ice-cold PBS, the cells were lysed with the Lysis Buffer and processed for immunoprecipitation. PKCε in the immunoprecipitates or purified preparation was treated with calf intestine alkaline phosphatase (New England Biolabs) at a final concentration of 1000 units/ml in a buffer containing 50 mmTris-HCl at pH 8.0, and 1 mm MgCl2 at 37 °C for 1 h. Bacterial expression plasmids for glutathione S-transferase (GST)- and His6 epitope-tagged proteins were constructed by using pGEX4T (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) and pRSET (Invitrogen), respectively. Tagged recombinant proteins were purified as described previously (18Takahashi M. Shibata H. Shimakawa M. Miyamoto M. Mukai H. Ono Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 17267-17274Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (205) Google Scholar). Transfer vector to generate recombinant virus was constructed by inserting PKCε cDNA into pBlueBacHis/GST (23Yoshinaga C. Mukai H. Toshimori M. Miyamoto M. Ono Y. J. Biochem. ( Tokyo ). 1999; 126: 475-484Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). His6/GST-tagged recombinant PKCε was expressed and purified by using glutathione-Sepharose 4B as described previously (23Yoshinaga C. Mukai H. Toshimori M. Miyamoto M. Ono Y. J. Biochem. ( Tokyo ). 1999; 126: 475-484Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). FLAG-tagged deletion mutant of CG-NAP was expressed in COS7 cells and immunoprecipitated with anti-FLAG Affi-Gel-agarose (Eastman Kodak Co.). Then the immunoprecipitates were mixed with insect cell-expressed PKCε pretreated with or without APase and incubated at 4 °C for 1 h in Binding Buffer (20 mm Tris-HCl at pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, 0.1% Triton X-100, 2 mmMgCl2, 1 mm EDTA, and 1 mmdithiothreitol) containing 8 mm NaPO4 at pH 7.2 to inhibit APase activity. After washing the resin with the Binding Buffer, the bound proteins were analyzed by immunoblotting. Bacterially expressed His6-tagged PKCε fragment was phosphorylated by incubation with insect cell-expressed PKCε at 30 °C for 2 h in a buffer containing 20 mm Tris-HCl at pH 7.5, 4 mm MgCl2, 100 μm ATP, and 40 μm arachidonic acid as an activator (24Koide H. Ogita K. Kikkawa U. Nishizuka Y. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 1149-1153Crossref PubMed Scopus (182) Google Scholar). Then the reaction mixture was 5-fold diluted with the Binding Buffer and incubated with bacterially expressed GST-tagged CG-NAP fragment at 4 °C for 1 h. Then glutathione-Sepharose 4B was added and incubated for further 30 min. After washing the resin with the same buffer, the bound proteins were analyzed by immunoblotting. Polyclonal antibodies against CG-NAP (αEE and αBH) were described previously (18Takahashi M. Shibata H. Shimakawa M. Miyamoto M. Mukai H. Ono Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 17267-17274Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (205) Google Scholar). The following antibodies were purchased: anti-PKCε and anti-PKA-RIIα (Transduction Laboratories); anti-phospho-PKCε (Upstate Biotechnology); mouse anti-HA 12CA5, and rat anti-HA 3F10 (Roche Molecular Biochemicals); anti-FLAG M2 (Kodak); anti-His6 antibody (Qiagen); rhodamine-conjugated anti-rabbit IgG, and dichlorotriazinylaminofluorescein-conjugated anti-mouse IgG (Chemicon International); peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibodies (Santa Cruz Biotechnology). Immunoprecipitates of PKCε were resuspended with a buffer containing 20 mm Tris-HCl at pH 7.5, and 4 mm MgCl2. Then aliquots were incubated at 30 °C for 5 min in a reaction mixture (25 μl) containing 20 mm Tris-HCl at pH 7.5, 4 mm MgCl2, 40 μm ATP, 18.5 kBq of [γ-32P]ATP, and 100 μm δPKC peptide (25Kitagawa M. Mukai H. Shibata H. Ono Y. Biochem. J. 1995; 310: 657-664Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar) in the presence or absence of activator 8 μg/ml phosphatidylserine (PS) and 0.8 μg/ml diolein (DO). The incorporation of 32P into δPKC peptide from [γ-32P]ATP was monitored as described previously (25Kitagawa M. Mukai H. Shibata H. Ono Y. Biochem. J. 1995; 310: 657-664Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). Cells grown on cover glasses were fixed with 3.7% formaldehyde in 0.2 mNaPO4 at pH 7.2 and permeabilized using 0.3% Triton X-100. Cells were blocked with 5% normal donkey serum in PBST (20 mm NaPO4 at pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, and 0.03% Triton X-100) and then incubated with the relevant antibody for 1 h at room temperature. The primary antibody was visualized by subsequent incubation with the appropriate secondary antibody conjugated with either rhodamine or dichlorotriazinylaminofluorescein. The fluorescence was observed under a confocal laser scanning fluorescent microscope (Zeiss) as described (18Takahashi M. Shibata H. Shimakawa M. Miyamoto M. Mukai H. Ono Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 17267-17274Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (205) Google Scholar). Exogenously expressed PKCε was co-immunoprecipitated with endogenous CG-NAP by anti-CG-NAP (Fig. 1 A, lane 3). The co-precipitated PKCε consisted of fast and slow migrating species, whereas PKCε in cell extracts appeared as a single band with slow mobility (Fig. 1 A, lane 1). A kinase-negative mutant, PKCε/K437M (Fig. 1 A, lane 2) mutated at ATP-binding site, was also co-immunoprecipitated with CG-NAP efficiently (Fig. 1 A, lane 4). Association between PKCε and CG-NAP was observed with endogenous proteins in rat brain extracts (Fig. 1 B, lane 3), suggesting that this association is physiological. Binding regions of PKCε and CG-NAP were examined by immunoprecipitation using deletion mutants (Fig. 2, A andB, respectively). Names of the deletion mutants of PKCε and CG-NAP were designated P1–P6 (Fig. 2 A, right) and C1–C5 (Fig. 2 B, right), respectively, with amino acid numbers. Binding regions of PKCε and CG-NAP were located in P2-(540–725) within the catalytic domain and C4-(3451–3899) at the C terminus, respectively.Figure 2Binding regions of PKC ε and CG-NAP. A, binding region of PKCε to CG-NAP. HA-tagged deletion mutants of PKCε were expressed in COS7 cells together with FLAG-tagged CG-NAP. Cell extracts were immunoprecipitated with anti-FLAG M2 (αFL) followed by immunoblot with anti-HA 3F10 (α HA).Lanes 6 and 7 were done with the second antibody preadsorbed with murine immunoglobulin. Schematic representation of PKCε is shown on the right with positions of Lys-437 in ATP-binding site and three potential phosphorylation sites.

Names and positions of the mutants are shownbelow. Mutant representing minimum binding region to PKCε is shaded. Mutant C5-(2875–3406) was used in the experiment shown in Fig. 4 A. The results shown are representative of three separate experiments.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) To examine whether the fast migrating PKCε appears during biosynthesis, pulse-chase labeling of newly synthesized PKCε was performed. As shown in Fig.3 A, wild type PKCε was synthesized as a fast migrating species and then converted to a slow migrating species within 120 min. Phosphatase treatment of the latter species resulted in shift to the fast mobility (Fig. 3 B, lane 3), indicating that the migration shift during biosynthesis is caused by phosphorylation. We next examined whether association with CG-NAP changes during biosynthesis of PKCε. 35S-Labeled fast migrating PKCε at 0 and 30 min of chase was co-immunoprecipitated with CG-NAP (Fig. 3 C, lanes 1 and2), whereas the slow migrating species at 30 and 120 min of chase was rarely detected in the precipitates (Fig. 3 C, lanes 2 and 3). These results indicate that CG-NAP preferentially associates with immature PKCε at non- or hypophosphorylated states. To assess the possibility that the association with CG-NAP depends on phosphorylation states of PKCε, in vitro binding studies were performed. PKCε has three potential phosphorylation sites of Thr-566 in the activation loop and Thr-710 and Ser-729 in the C-terminal region (Fig. 2 A, right). An antibody recognizing PKCε phosphorylated at Ser-729 (αSer(P)-729) was used to monitor phosphorylation/dephosphorylation reactions. As shown in Fig.4 A, insect cell-expressed phosphorylated PKCε specifically bound to FLAG-tagged CG-NAP/C4-(3451–3899), and the binding was increased when PKCε was dephosphorylated by APase (lane 2). Conversely, the effect of phosphorylation was examined by using bacterially expressed PKCε/P6-(364–725) or PKCε/P1-(364–737) (see Fig. 2 A) as a binding fragment and insect cell-expressed PKCε as a kinase. Either fragment bound to GST-tagged CG-NAP/C4-(3451–3899) (Fig.4 B, lanes 1 or 5). The binding was diminished by phosphorylation of PKCε/P6-(364–725) (Fig. 4 B, lane 2) containing potential phosphorylation sites of Thr-566 and Thr-710. Furthermore, phosphorylation of PKCε/P1-(364–737) completely abolished the binding (Fig. 4 B, lane 6). PKCε/P1-(364–737) contains an additional phosphorylation site of Ser-729 located outside of the binding region (amino acids 540–725, see Fig. 2 A). Phosphorylation of this site may affect conformation of the binding region; thus, we examined the effect of its mutation. PKCε/P3-(540–737), in which Ser-729 was not phosphorylated (data not shown), was efficiently co-immunoprecipitated with CG-NAP/C3-(2876–3899) (Fig. 4 C, lane 1). Mutation of Ser-729 to phosphorylation-deficient Ala did not affect the association (lane 2), whereas mutation to phosphorylation-mimicking Asp resulted in dissociation as expected (lane 3). These results confirmed that CG-NAP directly binds to PKCε at non- or hypophosphorylated states. PKCε co-immunoprecipitated with CG-NAP contained a slow migrating species as well as the fast migrating species (Fig. 1 A, lane 3). This slow migrating species appeared to be different from the mature PKCε, as it was not detected by αSer(P)-729 (data not shown). To investigate subcellular localization and catalytic activity of these immature PKCε associated with CG-NAP, mutants of the potential phosphorylation sites were examined. Phosphorylation-mimicking mutant of activation loop Thr-566 (PKCε/T566E) showed similar properties to wild type PKCε (whose majority was mature form) as follows: slow migration (Fig.5 A, left); efficient phosphorylation at Ser-729 (Fig. 5 A, right); second messenger-dependent catalytic activation (Fig.5 B); lower affinity to CG-NAP (Fig. 5 C); and cytosolic localization (Fig. 5 D). On the other hand, phosphorylation-deficient mutants of Thr-566 (PKCε/T566A) and Ser-729 (PKCε/S729A) as well as kinase-negative mutant (PKCε/K437M) represented different properties as follows: fast migration (Fig.5 A, left); no phosphorylation at Ser-729 (Fig. 5 A, right); and almost no basal and second messenger-dependent catalytic activity, although PKCε/S729A showed slight activation (Fig. 5 B). These phosphorylation-deficient mutants were efficiently associated and co-localized with endogenous CG-NAP at Golgi/centrosome area (Fig. 5,C and D, respectively). These results suggest that immature hypophosphorylated PKCε associated with CG-NAP is catalytically incompetent and co-localized at Golgi/centrosome area. In addition, Ser-729 was phosphorylated in PKCε/T566E but not in PKCε/T566A (Fig. 5 A), suggesting that Thr-566 phosphorylation within the activation loop is a prerequisite for Ser-729 phosphorylation. Ser-729 of a kinase-negative mutant PKCε/K437M was not phosphorylated, either. Furthermore, overexpression of wild type PDK1 resulted in increase in Ser-729 phosphorylation of wild type PKCε but not of PKCε/K437M (data not shown). These results suggest that Ser-729 phosphorylation depends on the catalytic competency of PKCε following the Thr-566 phosphorylation by PDK1. Our results led us to hypothesize the maturation process of PKCε as follows: newly synthesized non-phosphorylated PKCε associates with CG-NAP at Golgi/centrosome area; Thr-566 is phosphorylated by PDK1 followed by phosphorylation of the C-terminal sites Thr-710 and Ser-729 probably by auto-phosphorylation; sufficiently phosphorylated PKCε dissociates from CG-NAP and distributes to cytosol as mature PKCε responsive to the incoming second messenger signals. In addition, dephosphorylated PKCε by some phosphatase may re-associate with CG-NAP. PKCα and PKCβII lacking phosphates at Ser-657 and Ser-660, respectively (equivalent to Ser-729 of PKCε), are found to be structurally unstable as follows: thermo-labile, phosphatase-sensitive, and protease-sensitive (10Bornancin F. Parker P.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 3544-3549Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (173) Google Scholar, 11Edwards A.S. Newton A.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 18382-18390Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar). Therefore, CG-NAP may mediate the maturation of PKCε either directly by providing a scaffold for the phosphorylation reactions or indirectly by protecting unstable immature PKCε species. Although our findings suggest that Ser-729 of PKCε is auto-phosphorylated, we cannot exclude the possibility that a heterologous kinase might be involved in this reaction. PDK1 has been demonstrated to phosphorylate Ser-473 of PKB (equivalent to Ser-729 of PKCε), when it is bound to the C-terminal peptide of PRK2 (26Balendran A. Casamayor A. Deak M. Paterson A.

Recently, the C-terminal part of PKN has been revealed to associate with PDK1 (27Dong L.Q. Landa L.R. Wick M.J. Zhu L. Mukai H. Ono Y. Liu F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 5089-5094Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). As CG-NAP anchors PKN (18Takahashi M. Shibata H. Shimakawa M. Miyamoto M. Mukai H. Ono Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 17267-17274Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (205) Google Scholar), PKN might modify PDK1 activity, for instance, to phosphorylate Ser-729 of PKCε on CG-NAP. Further study will clarify the mechanism of PKCε phosphorylation taking place on CG-NAP. Now the growing number of kinases has been demonstrated to be regulated by phosphorylation (2Peterson R.T. Schreiber S.L. Curr. Biol. 1999; 9: R521-R524Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar). The role of the anchoring protein CG-NAP for the phosphorylation of PKCε described here may provide insight into the regulation of other members of AGC kinase superfamily. We thank Y.

Previous studies have demonstrated increased adipocyte α2/β-AR balance in obesity, and it has been proposed that increased α2-ARs in adipose tissue with or without decreased β-ARs may contribute mechanistically to the development of increased fat mass. To critically test this hypothesis, adipocyte α2/β-AR balance was genetically manipulated in mice. Human α2A-ARs were transgenically expressed in the adipose tissue of mice that were either homozygous (−/−) or heterozygous (+/−) for a disrupted β3-AR allele. Mice expressing α2-ARs in fat, in the absence of β3-ARs (β3-AR −/− background), developed high fat diet-induced obesity. Strikingly, this effect was due entirely to adipocyte hyperplasia and required the presence of α2-ARs, the absence of β3-ARs, and a high fat diet. Of note, obese α2-transgenic, β3 −/− mice failed to develop insulin resistance, which may reflect the fact that expanded fat mass was due to adipocyte hyperplasia and not adipocyte hypertrophy. In summary, we have demonstrated that increased α2/β-AR balance in adipocytes promotes obesity by stimulating adipocyte hyperplasia.

In addition, longitudinal studies in animal models have shown that α2-ARs are increased with fat cell hypertrophy and that increased α2/β-AR balance is correlated with obesity (5Lafontan M. Berlan M.

Murine adipocytes differ from human adipocytes in that they express many β3-ARs, in addition to β1- and β2-ARs, and very few α2-ARs (1Lafontan M. Berlan M. J. Lipid Res. 1993; 34: 1057-1091Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 12Castan I. Valet P. Quideau N. Voisin T. Ambid L. Laburthe M. Lafontan M. Carpéné C. Am. J.

In mice, β3-ARs are expressed predominantly in white and brown adipocytes, where they are thought to play an important role in regulating lipolysis and thermogenesis (1Lafontan M. Berlan M. J. Lipid Res. 1993; 34: 1057-1091Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Surprisingly, β3-AR gene knockout mice have little or no increase in body weight and only a slight increase in body fat (13Susulic V.S. Frederich R.C. Lawitts J. Tozzo E. Kahn B.B. Harper M.E.

The absence of greater effects of β3-AR deficiency on fat stores could be due to the fact that murine adipocytes, unlike human adipocytes, express very few α2-ARs (12Castan I. Valet P. Quideau N. Voisin T. Ambid L. Laburthe M. Lafontan M. Carpéné C. Am. J. Physiol. 1994; 266: R1141-R1147PubMed Google Scholar), which if present would antagonize actions mediated by residual β1- and β2-ARs and even initiate some additional effects. To assess the importance of α2/β-AR balance in adipocytes in vivo, we have combined gene targeting and transgenic approaches to create mice with increased α2/β-AR balance in adipose tissue. Specifically, the aP2 promoter (15Ross S.R. Graves R.A. Greenstein A. Platt K.A. Shyu H.L. Mellovitz B. Spiegelman B.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 9590-9594Crossref PubMed Scopus (184) Google Scholar) was used to drive adipocyte-specific expression of α2-ARs in mice that were either homozygous (−/−) or heterozygous (+/−) for a disrupted β3-AR allele. Mice with genetically altered α2/β-AR balance were then assessed for sensitivity to high fat diet-induced obesity. Of note, mice with increased α2/β-AR balance developed diet-induced obesity secondary to adipocyte hyperplasia. These results strongly suggest that α2/β-AR balance plays an important role in regulating fat mass. All genetically modified animals were created and maintained on an FVB/n inbred background and were genetically identical except for the specified genetic alterations. Creation of β3 −/− mice, homozygous for theArdb3 tm1Lowl allele, has previously been described (13Susulic V.S. Frederich R.C. Lawitts J. Tozzo E. Kahn B.B. Harper M.E. Himms-Hagen J. Flier J.S.

Comparisons between mice with Tg(ADRA2A)Lowl and without the α2-AR transgene were all performed on littermates. Animals were group-housed at 24 °C, had free access to food and water, and were handled in accordance with the principles and guidelines established by the National Institutes of Health. Where indicated, mice were weaned at the age of 3 weeks onto low fat (#D12450) or high fat (#D12451) diets (Research Diets, New Brunswick, NJ). Diets were matched for protein content and had the following composition (as a % of total calories): low fat diet (10% fat, 70% carbohydrate, and 20% protein); high fat diet (45% fat, 35% carbohydrate, and 20% protein). Specific binding of the α2-adrenergic receptor antagonist (3H)RX-821002 to fat cell membranes was determined after 30 min of incubation at 25 °C without (total binding) or with (nonspecific binding) 10 μm epinephrine (12Castan I. Valet P. Quideau N. Voisin T. Ambid L. Laburthe M. Lafontan M. Carpéné C. Am. J. Physiol. 1994; 266: R1141-R1147PubMed Google Scholar). The maximal number of α2-AR binding sites (B max) and equilibrium dissociation constants (K D) were calculated using Scatchard analysis of saturation binding data. The in vitro lipolytic response of isolated white fat cells to epinephrine without or with 10 μm selective α2-adrenergic receptor antagonist RX-821002 was measured. Adipocytes were isolated, and lipolysis was measured as described previously (12Castan I. Valet P. Quideau N. Voisin T. Ambid L. Laburthe M. Lafontan M. Carpéné C. Am. J. Physiol. 1994; 266: R1141-R1147PubMed Google Scholar). The in vivolipolytic response of conscious overnight-fasted mice was measured 10 min after a 0.1 mg/kg epinephrine intraperitoneal injection by non-esterified fatty acid blood levels. Total RNA was isolated using a Brinkman homogenizer and RNA STAT-60 solution (Tel-Test “B,” Inc., Friendswood, TX). α2-AR transgene mRNA was analyzed by Northern blotting using either a specific 1.5-kb SV40 probe or 1.2-kb α2C10 probe. UCP1 mRNA levels were analyzed by Northern blotting using a specific mouse 0.3-kb UCP1 cDNA probe. Oxygen consumption was measured in 10−week-old mice using the OXYMAX system 4.93 (Colombus Instruments, Colombus, OH), with a settling time of 100 s, a measuring time of 50 s, and with the reference as room air. The animals were placed in four 0.3-liter chambers at thermal neutrality (30 °C). The measurement of total body lipid content was performed as described previously (17Salmon D.M. Flatt J.P. Int. J. Obes. 1985; 9: 443-449PubMed Google Scholar, 18Hamann A. Flier J.S. Lowell B.B. Endocrinology. 1996; 137: 21-29Crossref PubMed Scopus (193) Google Scholar). Fat cell size and fat cell number per fat depot were determined in perigonadal fat samples using the Hirsch and Gallian method (19Hirsch J. Gallian E. J. Lipid Res. 1968; 9: 110-119Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) of lipid extraction, osmium tetroxide fixation, and Coulter Counter analysis. Histological determinations were performed as described previously (microscopic assessment of fat cell size; 600 cells per depot quantified in paraffin-embedded, inguinal fat pad sections from female mice) (20Sjostrom L. Bjorntorp P. Vrana J. J. Lipid Res. 1971; 12: 521-530Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 21Cinti S. Eberbach S. Castellucci M. Accili D. Diabetologia. 1998; 41: 171-177Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). Whole blood was collected and analyzed for blood glucose levels (One Touch blood glucose meter, Lifescan Inc., Milpitas, CA). Serum was isolated and assayed for non-esterified fatty acids (NEFA C kit, Wako Pure Chemical Industries, Ltd.), insulin, and leptin (mouse insulin or leptin kit, Linco Research Inc., St. Louis, MO). To evaluate the physiologic significance of adipocyte α2-ARs, we had previously generated and studied transgenic mice, on a wild-type β3-AR (+/+) background, which express human α2A-ARs in white and brown fat (22Soloveva V. Graves R.A. Spiegelman B.M. Ross S.R. J. Cell. Biochem. 1994; 18: 172Google Scholar) (transgene shown in Fig.1 a). Despite the presence of abundant α2-AR binding sites, transgenic mice had normal body weight and fat content (data not shown). We hypothesized that the absence of an effect of α2-ARs on fat stores was due to the presence of abundant β3-ARs, which along with β1- and β2-ARs override the inhibitory actions of transgenically expressed α2-ARs. In the present study, we assessed the importance of α2/β-AR balance in adipocytes by creating α2-AR transgenic mice (Tg(ADRA2A)1Lowl) on a β3-AR −/− and +/− background (mice −/− or +/− for theArdb3 tm1Lowl allele) (13Susulic V.S. Frederich R.C. Lawitts J. Tozzo E. Kahn B.B. Harper M.E. Himms-Hagen J. Flier J.S. Lowell B.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 29483-29492Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (422) Google Scholar). The transgene employed was the aP2-promoter/human α2A-AR construct mentioned above (shown in Fig. 1 a). As expected, mRNA encoding human α2A-AR was expressed in white and brown adipocytes, but not in liver, kidney, skeletal muscle, brain, intestine, heart, or non-adipocyte cells resident within adipose tissue (stroma-vascular fraction) (Fig.1 b). Using the α2-AR-selective radioligand, (3H)RX-821002, few α2-AR binding sites were found in membranes isolated from white adipocytes and brown adipose tissue of β3 −/− mice, confirming that murine adipocytes express very few α2-ARs (Fig. 1 c). In contrast, abundant binding sites were observed in membranes isolated from α2-trans, β3 −/− mice (Fig.1 c). It is important to note that the number of β1/β2-ARs (91.6 ± 4.0 fmol/mg of protein; n = 5) observed in adipocytes of α2-trans, β3 −/− mice was not different from that found in adipocytes of β3 −/− mice (102.7 ± 7.5 fmol/mg of protein; n = 3) and was within the range of β-AR binding sites typically observed in human fat cells (23Lacasa D. Mauriège P. Lafontan M. Berlan M. Giudicelli Y. J. Lipid Res. 1986; 27: 368-376Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Moreover, the number of α2-AR binding sites detected in α2-AR transgenic mice is comparable with that seen in human adipocytes and lower than that sometimes observed in obese human adipocytes (4Berman D.M. Nicklas B.J. Rogus E.M. Dennis K.E. Goldberg A.P. Metabolism. 1998; 47: 467-473Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar, 5Lafontan M. Berlan M. Endocr. Rev. 1995; 16: 716-738PubMed Google Scholar,7Galitzky J. Larrouy D. Berlan M. Lafontan M. J. Pharmacol. Exp. Ther. 1990; 252: 312-319PubMed Google Scholar). Epinephrine, an agonist for both β- and α2-ARs, stimulates lipolysis in white adipocytes by increasing cAMP levels (1Lafontan M. Berlan M. J. Lipid Res. 1993; 34: 1057-1091Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). As predicted, the human-like α2/β-AR balance obtained in α2-trans, β3 −/− mice shifted the epinephrine concentration-response curve for stimulation of lipolysis to the right (Fig.2 a, left panel). This effect was lost when the α2-AR-selective antagonist, RX-821002, was present (Fig. 2 a, right panel). In addition, the α2-AR agonist, UK14304, inhibited lipolysis in a concentration-dependent fashion (data not shown). Finally, displacement of (3H)RX-821002 binding by epinephrine in α2-trans, β3 −/− fat cell membranes (data not shown) gave the expected shallow competition curve with high and low affinity components (K iH, 0.81 nm;K iL, 30 nm) as classically described in human fat cells (7Galitzky J. Larrouy D. Berlan M. Lafontan M. J. Pharmacol. Exp. Ther. 1990; 252: 312-319PubMed Google Scholar). These results demonstrate that α2-ARs in transgenic adipocytes are coupled to Gi protein. As expected, the in vivo circulating free fatty acid response to a single injection of epinephrine was blunted in α2-trans, β3 −/− mice (Fig. 2 b). These in vitro and in vivo studies demonstrate that α2-ARs in white adipocytes of α2-trans, β3 −/− mice functionally antagonize epinephrine-induced stimulation of lipolysis (similar to what has been observed using isolated human white adipocytes) (6Berlan M. Lafontan M. Eur. J. Clin. Invest. 1985; 15: 341-348Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). The effects of α2-AR expression on brown fat function were assessed. Cold exposure induces sympathetic nervous stimulation ofUCP1 gene expression and thermogenesis in brown adipocytes, and this response plays an important role in maintaining the body temperature of mice (25Himms-Hagen J. Prog. Lipid Res. 1989; 28: 67-115Crossref PubMed Scopus (279) Google Scholar, 26Enerback S. Jacobsson A. Simpson E.M. Guerra C. Yamashita H. Harper M.E. Kozak L.P. Nature. 1997; 387: 90-94Crossref PubMed Scopus (1098) Google Scholar, 27Thomas S.A. Palmiter R.D. Nature. 1997; 387: 94-97Crossref PubMed Scopus (224) Google Scholar). Compared with wild-type mice, β3 −/− mice had impaired induction of UCP1 mRNA and decreased body temperature following acute cold exposure (Fig. 2 c). These responses were not inhibited further by expression of α2-ARs in brown fat (α2-trans, β3 −/− mice) (Fig. 2 c). In addition, a single injection of epinephrine stimulated energy expenditure to a similar degree in β3 −/− mice and α2-trans, β3 −/− mice (Fig. 2 d). These studies suggest that brown adipocyte function, in contrast to white adipocyte function, is not impaired by transgenic expression of α2-ARs. To assess effects of α2/β-AR balance on body weight and total body lipid content, β3 −/− mice and α2-trans, β3 −/− mice were fed high fat and low fat diets from age 3 weeks to 20 weeks. When fed a low fat diet, body weights were similar in β3 −/− mice and α2-trans, β3 −/− mice (Fig. 3 a). In contrast, when fed a high fat diet, body weights were markedly greater in α2-trans, β3 −/− mice compared with β3 −/− mice (Fig.3 b). Of interest, the effect of α2-AR expression on body weight was greater in female mice. A second line of α2-AR transgenic mice was created which, compared with the first line, expressed 50% lower levels of human α2-AR mRNA transcripts in white and brown fat (data not shown). Despite this lower level of expression, high fat diet-induced obesity was also observed in the second line of α2-AR transgenic mice on a β3-AR −/− background (Fig. 3 c). To assess the contribution of β3-AR deficiency in mediating the positive effect of α2-AR expression on high fat diet-induced obesity, α2-trans, β3 −/− mice (line 1) were crossed with wild-type mice (+/+ for the β3-AR allele). All offspring were ± for the β3-AR allele, whereas approximately 50% of offspring were positive for the α2-AR transgene. As above, mice were fed a high fat diet from age 3 weeks to 20 weeks. In contrast to studies performed using β3-AR −/− mice, α2-AR expression failed to promote high fat diet-induced obesity in β3-AR +/− mice (Fig. 3 d). Thus, development of high fat diet-induced obesity required both the presence of α2-ARs in fat and the absence of β3-ARs. Further study of β3 −/− mice and α2-trans, β3 −/− mice fed a high fat diet demonstrated that female mice expressing α2-ARs had a 2.7-fold increase in total body lipid content and 2.4- and 3.4-fold increases in perigonadal and inguinal fat pad weights, respectively (Fig. 4 a). Male mice expressing α2-ARs had a 1.5-fold increase in total body lipid content and 1.5- and 1.7-fold increases in perigonadal and inguinal fat pad weights, respectively (Fig. 4 b). These results demonstrate that increased body weight in high fat diet-fed α2-AR-expressing β3 −/− mice is due to an expansion of total body fat mass. To assess the contribution of adipocyte hyperplasia versushypertrophy to increased adipose tissue mass, the Hirsch and Gallian method (19Hirsch J. Gallian E. J. Lipid Res. 1968; 9: 110-119Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) of lipid extraction and osmium tetroxide fixation were used to determine fat cell size and number in the perigonadal depots of high fat diet-fed mice. Fat cell size was decreased in α2-trans, β3 −/− mice by 25% in females (not statistically significant) and by 32% in males. Fat cell number, on the other hand, was markedly increased in α2-trans, β3 −/− mice 3.5-fold in females and 1.7-fold in males. These findings indicate that expansion of adipose tissue mass in 20-week-old high fat diet-fed α2-trans, β3 −/− mice is due to adipocyte hyperplasia and not to an increase in fat cell size. This observation was confirmed using an alternative method of fat cell size determination (20Sjostrom L. Bjorntorp P. Vrana J. J. Lipid Res. 1971; 12: 521-530Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 21Cinti S. Eberbach S. Castellucci M. Accili D. Diabetologia. 1998; 41: 171-177Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar) (microscopic assessment of fat cell size; 600 cells per depot quantified in paraffin-embedded, inguinal fat pad sections from female mice) (data not shown). Obesity is usually associated with elevated blood levels of glucose, insulin, free fatty acids, and leptin. It has been proposed that these features of obesity are due to the presence of enlarged adipocytes (28Schneider B.S. Faust I.M. Hemmes R. Hirsch J. Am. J. Physiol. 1981; 240: E358-E362PubMed Google Scholar,29Van Harmelen V. Reynisdottir S. Eriksson P. Thorne A. Hoffstedt J. Lonnqvist F. Arner P. Diabetes. 1998; 47: 913-917Crossref PubMed Scopus (480) Google Scholar). However, as shown in Fig. 4 c, obese α2-trans, β3 −/− mice, have normal blood glucose and insulin levels and reduced fatty acid levels, which is in agreement with hyperplasia without changes in adipocyte size observed in these mice. The weak but significant rise in blood leptin levels is not associated with increased leptin mRNA expression in adipose tissue (data not shown) but probably with the higher number of adipocytes. In the present study we have used genetic engineering in mice to test the hypothesis that α2/β-AR balance in adipocytes is an important determinant of total body fat stores. By creating mice that have a “human-like” pattern of AR expression in fat (predominance of α2- over β1- and β2-ARs and absence of β3-ARs), we have demonstrated that increased α2/β-AR balance promotes high fat diet-induced obesity in mice. Notably, the development of obesity requires the presence of α2-ARs on adipocytes, the absence of β3-ARs, and a high fat diet, suggesting an important interaction between two genes (α2 andβ3-AR) and diet on the regulation of total body fat stores. The present study clearly indicates that increased α2/β-AR balance in adipocytes promotes high fat diet-induced obesity. However, the mechanism for this effect has yet to be established. Three possibilities are worthy of further discussion. Firstly, impaired sympathetic activation of lipolysis in white adipocytes could lead to increased accumulation of triglyceride. Secondly, impaired sympathetic activation of thermogenesis in brown adipose tissue could cause decreased energy expenditure and, consequently, positive energy balance. Thirdly, impaired sympathetic activation of white adipocytes could cause, via mechanisms to be discussed below, hyperplasia of white adipose tissue. Detailed analysis of α2-trans, β3 −/− mice indicates that the first and second possibilities are less likely to be true. Obesity due to either impaired lipolysis or decreased energy expenditure would be expected to cause adipocyte enlargement, a feature common to nearly all models of obesity (30Johnson P.R. Hirsch J. J. Lipid Res. 1972; 13: 2-11Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 31Bjorntorp P. Int. J. Obes. 1991; 15 Suppl. 2: 67-81PubMed Google Scholar). In the case of α2-trans, β3 −/− mice, obesity was due entirely to adipocyte hyperplasia. In addition, brown fat function appeared not to be impaired in α2-trans, β3 −/− mice. Thus, the fact that enlarged fat mass in α2-trans, β3 −/− mice is due entirely to the proliferation of small adipocytes strongly suggests that high α2/β-AR balance promotes adipocyte hyperplasia. The form of obesity observed in high fat diet-fed α2-trans, β3 −/− mice is atypical because it is due entirely to adipocyte hyperplasia. In this regard, these animals do not represent murine models of “typical” human obesity (31Bjorntorp P. Int. J. Obes. 1991; 15 Suppl. 2: 67-81PubMed Google Scholar). Obesity in humans as well as rodents is nearly always associated with adipocyte hypertrophy and hyperplasia. Typically, adipocyte hypertrophy occurs early during the development of obesity. It has been speculated that adipocytes, upon reaching a “critical fat cell size,” release a factor that promotes adipocyte hyperplasia; however, the identity of this hypothetical factor is unknown. The present study indicates that α2-trans, β3 −/− mice have a primary disturbance in adipocyte hyperplasia, and on that basis these animals provide a novel means to explore pathways controlling adipocyte hyperplasia. One candidate signal for stimulating adipocyte hyperplasia in α2-trans, β3 −/− mice is lysophosphatidic acid, a bio-active phospholipid. It has previously been shown that stimulation of α2-ARs causes release of lysophosphatidic acid leading to proliferation of preadipocytes (34Valet P. Pagès C. Jeanneton O. Dariaud D. Barbe P. Record M. Saulnier-Blache J.S. Lafontan M. J. Clin. Invest. 1998; 101: 1431-1438Crossref PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar). Further studies will be required to determine whether lysophosphatidic acid is the mediator of this effect. Obese α2-trans, β3 −/− mice, on the other hand, have an increased number of small adipocytes, normal blood glucose and insulin levels, reduced free fatty acid levels, and minimally elevated leptin levels (Fig. 4 c). In this regard, α2-trans, β3 −/− mice resemble rodents treated with thiazolidinediones (32Hallakou S. Doare L. Foufelle F. Kergoat M. Guerre-Millo M. Berthault M.F. Dugail I. Morin J. Auwerx J. Ferre P. Diabetes. 1997; 46: 1393-1399Crossref PubMed Scopus (283) Google Scholar, 33Okuno A. Tamemoto H. Tobe K. Ueki K. Mori Y. Iwamoto K. Umesono K. Akanuma Y. Fujiwara T. Horikoshi H. Yazaki Y. Kadowaki T. J. Clin. Invest. 1998; 101: 1354-1361Crossref PubMed Scopus (927) Google Scholar), agonists of peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-γ. Based upon this similarity, it is possible that increased α2/β-AR balance in adipocytes somehow leads to activation of peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-γ, possibly through generation of PPARγ ligands. High fat diet-fed α2-trans, β3 −/− mice develop an obesity that is characterized by an increase in both adipocyte number and lipid storage without any increase in fat cell size. The findings suggest that, when fed a high fat diet, α2-trans, β3 −/− mice develop obesity through two mechanisms: (i) an increase in fat cell number due to increased preadipocyte recruitment and (ii) an increase in the ability to store lipids due to impaired epinephrine-stimulated lipolytic activity. If increased lipid storage was not present, then average adipocyte size would have been decreased by an amount reciprocal to the increase in fat cell number. Because this was not the case, it must be assumed that lipid storage was also increased, an effect presumably mediated by α2-AR-induced antilipolytic activity, potentiated by the absence of β3-ARs. Thus, the increased fat mass in α2-trans, β3 −/− mice appears to be due to both preadipocyte recruitment and increased lipid storage in the newly recruited adipocytes. Brown adipocyte function appears not to have been impaired by transgenic expression of α2-ARs in β3 −/− mice. This assessment is based upon the observation that cold exposure-induced changes in UCP1 mRNA in brown fat and body temperature as well as epinephrine-induced effects on whole body oxygen consumption were not impaired in α2-trans, β3 −/− mice compared with β3 −/− control mice. This raises the possibility that α2-ARs in brown adipocytes were not negatively coupled to adenylate cyclase. The reason for such failure of coupling in brown adipocytes, but not white adipocytes, is presently unknown. In summary, the present study clearly demonstrates that increased α2/β-AR balance in adipose tissue promotes diet induced obesity. These findings suggest that increased α2/β-AR balance, which is frequently observed in human obesity (3Mauriège P. Prud'homme D. Lemieux S. Tremblay A. Després J.P. Am. J.

Identification of the biochemical mechanism by which α2/β-AR balance and high fat diet promote adipocyte hyperplasia will focus on the possible roles of lysophosphatidic acid and peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-γ. α2-trans, β3 −/− mice should provide a unique opportunity to explore the mechanisms by which expansion of adipose tissue mass is regulated.

These molecules encode proteins characterized by the presence of either one, two, or three α domains and either a 51- or 63-amino acid cytoplasmic domain. Moreover, mRNAs encoding isoforms lacking the transmembrane domain are observed. Several of these CD1e isoforms were expressed in transfected cells, and two of them, with three α domains, displayed a particular processing pathway. These latter isoforms slowly leave the endoplasmic reticulum due to the presence of atypical dilysine motifs in the cytoplasmic tail. These molecules are associated with the β2-microglobulin and accumulate in late Golgi and late endosomal compartments. In the latter compartments, they are cleaved into soluble forms that appear to be stable. In dendritic cells, these isoforms are mainly located in the Golgi apparatus, and upon maturation they are redistributed to late endosomal compartments.

This work demonstrates the existence of CD1e molecules. As compared with other CD1 molecules, CD1e displays fundamentally different properties and therefore may represent a third type of CD1 molecules. CD1 molecules (reviewed in Ref. 1Porcelli S.A. Modlin R.L. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 1999; 17: 297-329Crossref PubMed Scopus (603) Google Scholar) are nonclassical major histocompatibility complex class I molecules, composed of a membrane-associated heavy chain comprising three immunoglobulin-like extracellular α domains, which associate with β2-microglobulin (β2m).1 The number ofCD1 genes varies among species, only two closely relatedCD1 genes having been described in mice but five different genes in humans. The human CD1A, -B, -C, -D, and -E genes are constitutively expressed in a limited number of cell types, including cortical thymocytes and dendritic cells (DCs), and they can be induced by granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor in monocytes. The CD1A, -B, and -C genes encode structurally and functionally related proteins and are classified as type I CD1 genes. CD1a, -b, and -c molecules are found in the plasma membrane and in the endosomal compartments of DCs. However, depending on the DC type and stage of maturation, these molecules display differences in terms of their intracellular localization and traffic (2Sugita M. Grant E.P. van Donselaar E. Hsu V.W. Rogers R.A. Peters P.J. Brenner M.B. Immunity. 1999; 11: 743-752Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (175) Google Scholar). 2D. Hanau and J. Salamero, unpublished observations. These proteins can present glycolipids of microbial origin and, in the case of CD1b, also self-glycolipids (3Shamshiev A. Donda A. Carena I. Mori L. Kappos L. De Libero G. Eur. J. Immunol. 1999; 29: 1667-1675Crossref PubMed Scopus (251) Google Scholar). The presentation of glycolipids by CD1b is dependent on its internalization into acidic late endosomal compartments and recycling to the cell surface (2Sugita M. Grant E.P. van Donselaar E. Hsu V.W. Rogers R.A. Peters P.J. Brenner M.B. Immunity. 1999; 11: 743-752Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (175) Google Scholar). On the basis of homology studies, CD1d has been proposed to represent a second type of CD1 molecule, and structural and functional studies have confirmed this classification. Notably, whereas association with β2m is required for the cell surface expression of type I CD1 molecules (4Bauer A. Huttinger R. Staffler G. Hansmann C. Schmidt W. Majdic O. Knapp W. Stockinger H. Eur. J. Immunol. 1997; 27: 1366-1373Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar), human β2m-free CD1d can be expressed at the plasma membrane as a nonglycosylated protein (5Balk S.P. Burke S. Polischuk J.E. Frantz M.E. Yang L. Porcelli S. Colgan S.P. Blumberg R.S. Science. 1994; 265: 259-262Crossref PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar). In polarized human epithelial cells, nonglycosylated β2m-free CD1d molecules are observed on the apical cell surface, while glycosylated CD1d molecules are present on both sides of the cells (6Somnay-Wadgaonkar K. Nusrat A. Kim H.S Canchis W.P. Balk S.P. Colgan S.P. Blumberg R.S. Int. Immunol. 1999; 11: 383-392Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). In transfected melanoma cells, β2m-free CD1d molecules expressed at the cell surface are endoglycosidase H (Endo H)-sensitive, while β2m-associated CD1d molecules are Endo H-resistant (7Kim H.S. Garcia J. Exley M. Johnson K.W. Balk S.P. Blumberg R.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 9289-9295Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). Thus, three biochemically different forms of CD1d molecules have been described in humans. In human intestinal epithelial cells, CD1d is expressed on the cell surface and internalized into endosomal compartments. This traffic is controlled by aYXXZ motif in the cytoplasmic tail, which is likewise found in CD1b and CD1c (1Porcelli S.A. Modlin R.L. Annu. Rev.

Pedersen K. Balk S.P. Bakke O. J. Immunol. 1999; 162: 1488-1495PubMed Google Scholar). The murine molecules orthologous to CD1d are the CD1.1 and CD1.2 proteins. In mice, β2m-associated CD1 molecules are expressed at the surface of cells of different types including DCs, while in transfected cells murine CD1 is found on the plasma membrane and in endosomal compartments (9Mandal M. Chen X.R. Alegre M.L. Chiu N.M. Chen Y.H. Castano A.R. Wang C.R. Mol. Immunol. 1998; 35: 525-536Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). There is indirect evidence that β2m-free CD1d molecules exist in mice in that CD1-restricted T cells can develop in aged β2m-deficient mice (10Murakami M. Paul W.E. J. Immunol. 1998; 160: 2649-2654PubMed Google Scholar). Murine CD1 molecules bind different kinds of hydrophobic antigens, including peptides with hydrophobic anchor residues, glycosylphosphatidylinositol, and ceramide-containing glycolipids, which are also presented by human CD1d molecules (11Castano A.R.

The presentation of ceramide glycolipids by mouse CD1 or human CD1d antigens stimulates NKT cells, a T cell subpopulation expressing an invariant T cell receptor α chain and producing interleukin-4 and interferon-γ upon stimulation. In mice, the activation of NKT cells by CD1 proteins appears to play key role in the induction of systemic immune tolerance following immunization through an immune-privileged site (14Sonoda K.H. Exley M. Snapper S. Balk S.P. Stein-Streilein J. J. Exp. Med. 1999; 190: 1215-1226Crossref PubMed Scopus (318) Google Scholar), although the ligands of CD1 involved in this process are not known. At least in mice, CD1 molecules also stimulate other T cell subsets (15Chiu Y.H. Jayawardena J Weiss A Lee D Park S.H. Dautry-Varsat A Bendelac A. J. Exp. Med. 1999; 189: 103-110Crossref PubMed Scopus (251) Google Scholar). CD1e molecules have not been studied to date. The human CD1E gene was described more than 14 years ago and shown to be transcribed in Jurkat and Molt4 tumor T cell lines (16Martin L.H. Calabi F. Milstein C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1986; 83: 9154-9158Crossref PubMed Scopus (160) Google Scholar,17Woolfson A. Milstein C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 6683-6687Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar), and several partially characterized transcripts were registered in GenBankTM. However, the existence of protein(s) encoded by the CD1E gene has not yet been demonstrated. The aims of the present work were thus to analyze the pattern of CD1e transcripts in DCs, to determine whether CD1E gene product(s) could direct the synthesis of proteins, and to define the different cellular and biochemical properties of CD1e molecules. Total RNA from DC were prepared using RNeasy extraction kit (Qiagen, Les Ullis, France). RNA was reverse transcribed with avian myeloblastosis virus reverse transcriptase (Eurogentec, Seraing, Belgium) using random hexanucleotides as primers. CD1e cDNAs were amplified using 100 ng of reverse transcribed RNA, Taq DNA polymerase (Goldstar, Eurogentec), and GGGGGATATCCTCCTTTAACAGAGCTTCA and ATTTGGGGAGTACAGAAGAG oligonucleotides (94 °C for 30 s, 56 °C for 30 s, and 72 °C for 2 min, 35 cycles). Amplified products were digested withEcoRV and EcoRI and cloned into the homologous restriction sites of pEGFP-N3 (CLONTECH, Palo Alto, CA). To express CD1e/CD1c or CD1c/CD1e fusion molecules, first a plasmid encoding CD1c with Eco47III and ScaI restriction sites located in the N-terminal and the C-terminal parts of the transmembrane domain, respectively, was constructed. This construction, obtained by polymerase chain reaction mutagenesis, encodes for the exact sequence of CD1c protein. Plasmids encoding CD1c (extracellular and transmembrane domains)/CD1e (part of the CD1e cytoplasmic domain) fusion molecules were then obtained by inserting fragments encoding part of the CD1e cytoplasmic domain and amplified by polymerase chain reaction in the ScaI site. Before cloning into theScaI site, the fragments encoding the N-terminal half of the long or short cytoplasmic domains (DSRLKKQSSNKNILSPHTPSPVFLMGANTQDTKN and DSRLKKQSPVFLMGANTQDTKN, respectively) were cut withEcoRI and treated with T4 DNA polymerase, producing a stop codon at the end of the fragments. The amino acid sequence of theEco-end fragment (C-terminal half of the CD1e cytoplasmic domain) fused to CD1c was NSRHQFCLAQVSWIKNRVLKKWKTRLNQLW. The plasmid pL213 encodes the first 305 amino acids of CD1e, four extra unrelated amino acids (DLEAK), and then the amino acids of the transmembrane and cytoplasmic domains of CD1c fused to eGFP. Natural CD1e isoforms were expressed by inserting the different reconstituted full-length CD1e cDNA clones downstream from the cytomegalovirus promotor of pEGFP-N3 expression vector. Plasmid cDNAs were transfected in cell lines using Fugene (Roche Diagnostics, Meylan, France) or Exgen (Euromedex, Schiltigheim, France) reagents. Stable M10 transfectants were isolated using 500 μg/ml G418 (Life Technologies, Paisley, UK). The transfected clones expressing the membrane-associated isoforms were selected by immunofluorescence staining on fixed and permeabilized cells using VIIC7 monoclonal antibody (mAb). Clones expressing pL213 were first selected using the fluorescence of eGFP. Fluorescence microscopy showed the hybrid molecule to be expressed on the cell surface. HeLa cells were obtained from ATCC (number CCL-2). The melanoma M10 cell line was kindly provided by Dr. T. Hercend (Villejuif, France). HeLa cells were grown in Dulbecco's culture medium, and M10 cells were grown in RPMI 1640, all supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum (Life Technologies). Monocyte-derived DCs and epidermal Langerhans cells (LCs) were prepared as previously (18Saudrais C. Spehner D. de la Salle H. Bohbot A. Cazenave J.-P. Goud B. Hanau D. Salamero J. J.

Mature LCs were obtained by 48-h culture in RPMI 1640 supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum, 50 ng/ml granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor (generously provided by Novartis, Rueil Malmaison, France), and 30 ng/ml TNFα. The following mAbs were used: B1G6 (anti-β2m, IgG2a) (Immunotech, Marseille, France); mouse IgG1κ (anti-GFP, clones 7.1 and 13.1) (Roche Molecular Biochemicals); L161 (anti-CD1c, IgG1) (Immunotech); W6/32 (pan-anti-HLA class I, IgG2a) (Dako, Trappes, France); biotinylated goat anti-mouse IgG (Pharmingen, San Diego, CA); fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated F(ab′)2 goat anti-mouse IgG (Silenus, Melbourne, Australia); phycoerythrin-conjugated F(ab′)2 goat anti-mouse IgG (Dako), F(ab′)2 fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated donkey anti-rabbit IgG and Cy3-conjugated F(ab′)2 donkey anti-mouse IgG (Jackson Immunoresearch, West Baltimore, PA); Alexa-594-conjugated goat anti-mouse IgGs and Alexa-488-conjugated goat anti-mouse IgG (Molecular Probes, Inc., Eugene, OR); and control IgG1 and IgG2a (Immunotech). H5C6 (IgG1, anti-CD63, was kindly provided by Dr F. Lanza, EFS-Alsace, Strasbourg) and the rabbit anti-EEA1 antiserum (20Simonsen A. Lippe R. Christoforidis S. Gaullier J.M. Brech A. Callaghan J.

H5C6 was directly coupled to cyanin 3 using a Cy3 labeling kit (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Polyclonal rabbit IgGs against Rab-6 were produced and purified as described (21Martinez O. Schmidt A. Salamero J. Hoflack B. Roa M. Goud B. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 127: 1575-1588Crossref PubMed Scopus (221) Google Scholar). Polyclonal anti TGN-46 (22Prescott A.R. Lucocq J.M. James J. Lister J.M. Ponnambalam S. Eur. J.

Carlsson, (University of Umea, Sweden). The mAb VIIC7 (IgG1, anti-CD1e cytoplasmic domain) was obtained by immunizing mice with a synthetic peptide (YIKNRVLKKWKTRL, corresponding to amino acids −17/−5 of the cytoplasmic domain) coupled to keyhole limpet hemocyanin. Hybridomas were screened with a dot blot assay using a glutathione S-transferase-CD1e cytoplasmic domain fusion protein expressed in E. coli. The mAbs 1.2 (IgG1), 2.9 (IgG2a), and 20.6 (IgG1) (anti-CD1e α domains) were obtained by immunizing mice with an M10 cell line transfected with pL213. Hybridomas were screened by incubating untransfected or pL213-transfected M10 cells first with hybridoma supernatants and then with biotinylated anti-mouse Abs and finally with Cy-Chrome-conjugated streptavidin (Pharmingen). The specificities of these mAbs were determined using HeLa cells transfected with plasmids obtained in the cloning step. All membrane-associated CD1e isoforms were expressed as protein lacking the C-terminal end of the cytoplasmic domain (downstream from theEcoRI restriction site) fused to enhanced green fluorescent protein (eGFP) (CD1e ΔCyt-eGFP molecules). The cells were fixed, permeabilized, and incubated with antibody 1.22, 2.9, or 20.6 followed by Cy3-conjugated anti-mouse Abs. Simultaneous eGFP and Cy3 labeling revealed the specificities of the mAbs for the different membrane-associated isoforms of CD1e. Cells were washed in cold phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) and incubated with the relevant mAb in PBS for 30 min at 4 °C. In indirect staining experiments, the cells were incubated with fluorescein isothiocyanate- or phycoerythrin-conjugated goat anti-mouse IgG for 30 min at 4 °C. Controls included staining with an isotype-matched irrelevant Ab. In intracellular staining, the cells were first fixed with 1% paraformaldehyde in PBS for 15 min and washed in cold PBS, and the primary Ab was added in staining buffer (RPMI 1640, 5% normal goat serum, 0.2% sodium azide, 0.1% saponin) for 30 min at 4 °C. The cells were then washed twice in saponin buffer (0.1% saponin in PBS), and the secondary Ab was added in the same buffer. The cells were washed twice in saponin buffer and twice in PBS before analysis on a FACScan cytometer (Becton Dickinson). Immunofluorescence (IF) microscopy of fixed permeabilized DCs was carried out as described previously (18Saudrais C. Spehner D. de la Salle H. Bohbot A. Cazenave J.-P. Goud B. Hanau D. Salamero J. J. Immunol. 1998; 160: 2597-2607PubMed Google Scholar). Confocal laser scanning microscopy and IF analyses (24Salamero J. Le Borgne R. Saudrais C. Goud B. Hoflack B. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 30318-30321Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar) were performed as described on a Leica TCS4D confocal microscope (Leica Lazer Tecknik, Heidelberg, Germany). Confluent 75-cm2 flasks of transfected or untransfected cells were washed twice in PBS and incubated for 1 h in 20 ml of methionine and cysteine-free medium supplemented with 10% dialyzed fetal calf serum and 1 mm glutamine. The cells were washed twice and labeled with 250 μCi of [35S] methionine and cysteine (Promix; Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) in 3 ml of medium for 30 min to 1 h. The reaction was stopped by the addition of ice-cold PBS followed by two washing steps. After chase in 20 ml of RPMI containing 10% fetal calf serum, the cells were lysed in 1 ml of lysis buffer (20 mm Tris, pH 8, 150 mm NaCl, 5 mm EDTA, 1% Triton X-100, 1 mmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1 μg/ml aprotinin, 1 μg/ml pepstatin, 2 μg/ml leupeptin) for 20 min on ice. Lysates were centrifuged at 20,000 × g for 15 min and were incubated twice with 50 μl of protein A-Sepharose (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) for 2 h. Supernatants were incubated with protein A-Sepharose and 5 μg of mAb or irrelevant isotype-matched mAb for 2 h. After extensive washing, the immunoprecipitates were treated or not with Endo Hf or Endo F (Biolabs, Beverly, CA). Samples were separated on 12.5% SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (PAGE) gels under reducing conditions. Gels were treated with Amplify (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) and exposed for autofluorography. Since humanCD1A, -B, and -C genes are expressed in DCs, we first tested whether this was the case for theCD1E gene. RNA from monocyte-derived DCs was reverse transcribed, and CD1e cDNA was amplified by polymerase chain reaction using oligonucleotides hybridizing with the 5′- and 3′-untranslated regions of the gene. Several fragments were co-amplified, digested with EcoRV (present in the sequence of the 5′ oligonucleotide) and EcoRI (present in the middle of the coding sequence in the 3′ exon), and cloned into the homologous restriction sites of the pEGFP-N3 expression vector. Sequence analysis of the clones revealed a multiplicity of alternatively spliced transcripts of CD1e. Among 45 clones analyzed, more than 15 alternatively spliced mRNA species could be characterized (Fig.1 A). Two mRNAs encode a membrane protein with three extracellular α domains, a transmembrane domain and either a long or a short cytoplasmic domain. The two cytoplasmic domains (CytL and CytS) are encoded by two alternatively spliced exon VI region, and both are quite long (63 and 51 amino acids, respectively) as compared with those of other CD1 molecules (6–10 amino acids). Two potential glycosylation sites are located in the α1 domain. Other forms include only one (α3) or two α domains (α2α3, or α1α3), the transmembrane domain and either the short or the long cytoplasmic domain. An increase in diversity results from the use of two alternative donor splicing sites from intron 4, which gives rise to mRNA sequences encoding molecules with truncated α3 domains. One of these forms retains only 37 amino acids of the 93 amino acids of the complete α3 domain (α3""). Since the reading frame is conserved, these molecules remain membrane-associated. The second alternative splicing (α3′) induces a frameshift in the fifth exon, which produces mRNAs encoding a molecule with 57 amino acids of the α3 domain and 24 additional amino acids and thus leads to a possible soluble secreted form. The N-terminal sequence of all isoforms is 10 amino acids longer than that deduced from the genomic sequence reported in GenBankTM (X14975). Only one clone retaining the 3′-end of the mRNA could be isolated, suggesting that no alternative splicing occurs downstream from the EcoRI restriction site. In order to study the localization of the different isoforms, several mAbs were selected and then tested on transfected cells expressing individual CD1e isoforms, fused or not with eGFP. The eGFP-fused molecules were examined first for practical reasons, as they could be expressed using the recombinant plasmids obtained in the cloning step. Membrane-associated CD1e isoforms expressed using these vectors were fused to eGFP at the EcoRI restriction site in the middle of the sequence encoding the cytoplasmic domain. Consequently, these constructions lacked the 28 C-terminal amino acids of the cytoplasmic domain encoded by the sequences downstream from theEcoRI restriction site and were designated using the “Δ Cyt” suffix. All isoforms were further designated by listing their different constitutive domains (Fig. 1 B; only a few representative isoforms are shown). A mouse mAb (VIIC7) was raised against a peptide of the CD1e cytoplasmic domain (at positions −5/−17). Additional experiments confirmed that this mAb could be used to follow the expression of membrane-associated CD1e isoforms in transfected cells by IF, immunoprecipitation, and Western blotting. 3C. Angénieux, unpublished observations. Abs specific for the α domains were obtained by constructing a plasmid encoding a hybrid protein comprising the three α domains of CD1e, fused to the transmembrane and intracellular domains of CD1c and to eGFP. M10 cells transfected with this expression vector were shown by IF microscopy and biochemical experiments to express the hybrid molecule on the cell surface. Mice were immunized with the transfected cells and hybridomas were prepared from one mouse. Three mAbs, named (1.22, 2.9, and 20.6) were selected, which stained the transfected cells but not untransfected M10 cells. The specificity of these mAbs was tested on HeLa cells transiently transfected with plasmids encoding the different isoforms. In these experiments, the membrane-associated molecules were expressed as CD1e ΔCyt-eGFP fusion proteins. The cells were fixed, permeabilized, stained with the different mAbs, and analyzed by IF microscopy (Table I). None of the mAbs stained transfected HeLa cells expressing the α2α3 isoform, while in IF studies the mAb 1.22 recognized all other isoforms, thus appearing to be specific for the α1 domain. The mAb 20.6 stained cells expressing the α1α2α3, α1α2α3′, and α1α2α3"" isoforms hence was more selective than 1.22. Although the mAb 2.9 specifically recognized the three α domain isoforms, the intensity of the signals were poor relative to those of the other mAbs, and 2.9 was therefore inappropriate for IF staining. On the basis of eGFP fluorescence or mAb staining, the CD1e α1α2-, α2α3-, and α1α2α3""-ΔCyt-eGFP molecules appeared to be retained in the ER. In contrast, CD1e α1α2α3ΔCytL-eGFP were found on the cell surface and intracellularly.Figure 1CD1e alternatively spliced forms.

Cells were analyzed using IF microscopy. Additional experiments using transfected M10 cells showed that all three mAbs could be used to detect CD1e isoforms by immunoprecipitation and displayed identical specificity as in IF, whereas none of them could be used for Western blotting. Moreover, cytofluorimetry on transfected cells expressing either CD1a, -b, or -c molecules demonstrated that these mAbs do not react with the other CD1 molecules expressed by DCs.3 Preliminary IF experiments using the VIIC7 mAb showed that whereas CD1e α1α2α3ΔCyt-eGFP fusion molecules transiently expressed in HeLa cells could reach the plasma membrane, complete CD1e molecules expressed in transfected cells appeared to be retained in the ER (data not shown). This suggested that the 28 C-terminal amino acids were involved in the retention of the full-length CD1e molecules. Since initially we had no mAb against the α domains of CD1e, it was not possible to directly determine which part of the protein mediated its retention in the ER. Therefore, we constructed plasmids expressing hybrid molecules consisting of the extracellular and transmembrane domains of CD1c fused to different parts of the CD1e cytoplasmic domains. The transmembrane domain of CD1c was fused to the N-terminal part of the cytoplasmic domain of the CytL and CytS isoforms, encoded by sequences upstream from theEcoRI restriction site (CD1c-ΔCytL* and CD1c-ΔCytS*), or to the C-terminal half of the cytoplasmic domain, encoded by sequences downstream from the EcoRI restriction site (CD1c-Eco-end) (Fig.2 A). These CD1c/CD1e hybrid molecules were expressed in M10 cells, an HLA-DR+ melanoma cell line that contains, like DCs, cellular compartments involved in the processing of exogenous antigens. Controls included cells transfected with CD1c alone. Stably transfected M10 cells were permeabilized or not, stained with an anti-CD1c mAb, and analyzed by flow cytometry or confocal microscopy. In M10 cells, CD1c molecules as well as CD1c-ΔCytL* and CD1c-ΔCytS* hybrid molecules were found on the cell surface (Fig. 2 B). In contrast, CD1c-Eco-end was only weakly present on the cell surface, although the intracellular staining showed it to be expressed equally as strongly as the other molecules. Confocal microscopy revealed intracellular CD1c molecules to be localized in HLA-DR+compartments, as expected, while CD1c-Eco-end molecules were principally in the ER.3 The C-terminal region of this part of the cytoplasmic domain of CD1e contains two overlapping dilysine motifs (KKXK), both of which are known to mediate the retention of molecules in the ER (25Teasdale R.D. Jackson M.R. Annu. Rev. Cell Dev. Biol. 1996; 12: 27-54Crossref PubMed Scopus (447) Google Scholar). Dilysine motifs are generally located at amino acids −3/−4 (KK motif) or −3/−5 (KXK motif) of the cytoplasmic domain, whereas the KKXK sequence of CD1e lies at positions −8/−11. The function of this sequence was explored by expressing in M10 cells other hybrid molecules comprising the extracellular and transmembrane domains of CD1c fused to the cytoplasmic domain CytL, complete or truncated at different positions in the C-terminal end. Hybrid fusion proteins containing the complete cytoplasmic domain of CD1e (short or long) could not be detected on the surface of transfected M10 cells.3 Similarly, a CD1e long cytoplasmic tail deleted of the first five C-terminal amino acids induced a complete intracellu"
https://openalex.org/W2079157056,"Interleukin-11 (IL-11) is a member of the gp130 family of cytokines. These cytokines drive the assembly of multisubunit receptor complexes, all of which contain at least one molecule of the transmembrane signaling receptor gp130. IL-11 has been shown to induce gp130-dependent signaling through the formation of a high affinity complex with the IL-11 receptor (IL-11R) and gp130. Site-directed mutagenesis studies have identified three distinct receptor binding sites of IL-11, which enable it to form this high affinity receptor complex. Here we present data from immunoprecipitation experiments, using differentially tagged forms of ligand and soluble receptor components, which show that multiple copies of IL-11, IL-11R, and gp130 are present in the receptor complex. Furthermore, it is demonstrated that sites II and III of IL-11 are independent gp130 binding epitopes and that both are essential for gp130 dimerization. We also show that a stable high affinity complex of IL-11, IL-11R, and gp130 can be resolved by nondenaturing polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, and its composition verified by second dimension denaturing polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. Results indicate that the three receptor binding sites of IL-11 and the Ig-like domain of gp130 are all essential for this stable receptor complex to be formed. We therefore propose that IL-11 forms a hexameric receptor complex composed of two molecules each of IL-11, IL-11R, and gp130."

To identify the dimerization domain, we transiently expressed in HEK-293 cells a truncated version of mGluR1 (RhodC-R1) devoid of the extracellular domain (ECD). RhodC-R1 was a monomer in the absence or presence of the reducing agents, suggesting that dimerization occurs via the ECD. To identify cysteine residues involved in dimerization within the ECD, cysteine to serine point mutations were made at three cysteines within the amino-terminal half of the ECD. A mutation at positions Cys-67, Cys-109, and Cys-140 all resulted in significant amounts of monomers in the absence of reducing agents. The monomeric C67S and C109S mutants were not properly glycosylated, failed to reach the cell surface, and showed no glutamate response, indicating that these mutant receptors were improperly folded and/or processed and thus retained intracellularly. In contrast, the monomeric C140S mutant was properly glycosylated, processed, and expressed at the cell surface. Phosphoinositide hydrolysis assay showed that the glutamate response of the C140S mutant receptor was similar to the wild type receptor. Substitution of a cysteine for Ser-129, Lys-134, Asp-143, and Thr-146 on the C140S mutant background restored receptor dimerization. Taken together, the results suggest that Cys-140 contributes to intermolecular disulfide-linked dimerization of mGluR1.

The eight members of the mGluR family (mGluR1–8) of receptors have been divided into three subgroups based on sequence homology, signal transduction properties, and pharmacological profile (1Conn P.J. Pin J.-P. Ann. Rev. Pharmacol. Toxicol. 1997; 37: 205-237Crossref PubMed Scopus (2716) Google Scholar). The mGluR1 and mGluR5 receptors and their splice variants make up the group 1 mGluRs, which are coupled to the stimulation of phosphoinositol turnover via the Gq subfamily of G-proteins. The mGluRs and other family 3 GPCRs are characterized by a very large (approximately ∼600 residues) extracellular amino-terminal domain (ECD). The mGluR1 ECD is the glutamate binding domain and believed to be structurally related to the bilobed “venus flytrap” structure of bacterial periplasmic binding proteins (9O'Hara P.J. Sheppard P.O.

The rat mGluR subtype 1α (described as mGluR1 from now on) ECD contains a total of 19 cysteines (16Masu M. Tanabe Y. Tsuchida K. Shigemoto R. Nakanishi S. Nature. 1991; 349: 760-765Crossref PubMed Scopus (989) Google Scholar) of which several are highly conserved in other mGluRs, Ca2+ receptor, V2Rs, and T1Rs. Proteolysis of the mGluR5 receptor localized cysteine(s) critical for dimer formation to the first 17 kDa of the ECD (17Romano C. Yang W.L. O'Malley K.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 28612-28616Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (442) Google Scholar). This region contains three cysteines conserved in all mGluRs, and we mutated these cysteines of the mGluR1 and investigated the role of these cysteine mutants in receptor dimerization and function. This study led to the identification of a conserved Cys-140 as critical for disulfide-linked dimerization of mGluR1, and functional study indicated that, like the wild type receptor, C140S mutant receptor is also capable of intracellular signaling via Gq-phospholipase C pathway. Using Turbo Pfu DNA polymerase (Stratagene Inc.), a polymerase chain reaction (PCR) was performed to add 20 amino acid residues (MNGTEGPNFYVPFSNKTGVV) corresponding to the amino terminus of bovine rhodopsin to the mGluR1 before amino acid residue 584. The 1.8-kilobase PCR product was subcloned to the pCR3.1 expression vector (Invitrogen) as a HindIII-XhoI fragment. The entire nucleotide sequence of the PCR product was confirmed by using a dRhodamine terminator cycle sequencing reaction kit and ABI prizm-377 DNA sequencer (Applied Biosystems). The constructed truncation mutant, designated as RhodC-R1, was devoid of 1–583 amino-terminal ECD of the mGluR1 but included 20 amino acids of the amino terminus rhodopsin tag and the amino acid residues 584–1199 of mGluR1. mGluR1 cDNA was cloned in pCR3.1 expression vector (Invitrogen) as aBamHI-NotI fragment. Site-directed mutagenesis was performed using a commercial kit (QuikChange site-directed mutagenesis kit, Stratagene) as described by Ray et al.(18Ray K. Clapp P. Goldsmith P.K. Spiegel A.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 34558-34567Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar). Three cysteine point mutants, C67S, C107S, and C140S were created by changing cysteine at a given site to serine. Seven Cys-scanning mutants, S119C, S126C, S129C, K134C, D143C, T146C, and T152C were created in a second round of mutagenesis by using C140S mutant plasmid DNA as a template. The mutations were confirmed by automated DNA sequencing using a dRhodamine terminator cycle sequencing reaction kit and the ABI prizm-377 DNA sequencer (Applied Biosystems). Receptor plasmid DNAs were prepared by a maxi-plasmid preparation kit (Qiagen) and were transiently transfection in HEK-293 cells using LipofectAMINE (Life Technologies) as described previously (19Ray K. Fan G.F. Goldsmith P.K. Spiegel A.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 31355-31361Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar). Protein extraction for immunoblotting or biotinylation-immunoprecipitation experiments was performed 48 h after transfection. Crude membrane extracts were prepared as described previously by Ray et al. (19Ray K. Fan G.F. Goldsmith P.K. Spiegel A.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 31355-31361Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar). Briefly, confluent cells in 75-cm2 flasks or 6-well plates were rinsed with ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline and scraped on ice in buffer A (5 mm Tris (pH 7.2), 2 mm EDTA), containing 10 mm iodoacetamide with freshly added Complete protease inhibitors mixture (Roche Molecular Biochemicals). The cells were forced through a 22-gauge needle five to eight times, and the lysate was spun in a TLA-45 centrifuge at 45,000 rpm for 30 min at 4 °C to collect a crude membrane pellet. The pellet was resuspended in buffer B containing 20 mm Tris-HCl (pH 6.8), 150 mmNaCl, 10 mm EDTA, 1 mm EGTA, 1% Triton X-100 with 10 mm iodoacetamide and freshly added protease inhibitors mixture. Whole cell extracts were prepared by solubilizing cells directly in buffer B containing 1% Triton-100 as described earlier (13Ray K. Hauschild B.C. Steinbach P.J. Goldsmith P.K. Hauache O. Spiegel A.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 27642-27650Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (172) Google Scholar). The protein content of each sample was determined by the modified Bradford method (Bio-Rad) and 20–30 μg of protein per lane was separated on 5% gel by SDS-PAGE. Electrotransferred proteins to nitrocellulose membranes were incubated with monoclonal anti-mGluR1 antibody (Transduction laboratories, catalog # M72620) at a dilution of 1: 10,000 or anti-mGluR1 polyclonal antibody at a dilution of 1:500 (Chemicon, catalog # AB1553). Subsequently, the nitrocellulose membrane was incubated with a secondary goat anti-mouse or anti-rabbit antibody conjugated to horseradish peroxidase (Kierkegaard and Perry Laboratories) at a dilution of 1: 5000, respectively. The mGluR1 bands were detected with an Enhanced Chemiluminescence system (ECL) (Amersham Corp). Biotinylated protein bands were detected using peroxidase-conjugated streptavidin-POD followed by visualization of the biotinylated bands using a BM chemiluminescence kit (Roche Molecular Biochemicals). 48 h after transfection, cell surface proteins of the intact HEK-293 cells were labeled with membrane-impermeant Biotin-7-NHS using the cellular labeling kit (Roche Molecular Biochemicals) as described earlier (19Ray K. Fan G.F. Goldsmith P.K. Spiegel A.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 31355-31361Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar). Briefly, intact cells were labeled with 50 μg/ml Biotin-7-NHS in biotinylation buffer (50 mm sodium borate, 150 mm NaCl) to biotinylate cell surface proteins. The reaction was stopped by adding 50 mm NH4Cl for 15 min on ice. The cells were washed with phosphate-buffered saline and solubilized with lysis buffer B. 300 μl (approximately 600 μg of total protein) of the whole cell lysate of biotin-labeled cells was further diluted with 300 μl of buffer B and incubated with 5 μl of mouse monoclonal mGluR1-specific (made against the carboxyl-terminal peptide corresponding to amino acids 1042–1160; 0.1 mg/ml stock; Transduction laboratories, Lexington, KY) for 1–2 h at 4 °C. Subsequently, 25 μl of Protein A/G-agarose (Santa Cruz Biotechnologies) was added, and the incubation was continued for an additional 2 h. The Protein A/G-agarose was washed three times with buffer B containing 0.5% SDS, and the immunoreactive proteins were eluted in sample buffer containing either no β-mercaptoethanol or 300 mm β-mercaptoethanol. Samples were analyzed by SDS-PAGE, and immunoblotting was performed as described before. For cleavage with PNGase-F or Endo-H (Roche Molecular Biochemicals), whole cell extracts (30 μl) were diluted in 20 μl of 50 mmsodium acetate (pH 4.8). Samples were incubated with 0.5 milliunits of Endo-H or 1.0 unit of PNGase-F for 2 h at 37 °C. Phosphoinositide (PhI) hydrolysis assay has been described previously (18Ray K. Clapp P. Goldsmith P.K. Spiegel A.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 34558-34567Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar). Briefly, 24 h after transfection, transfected cells from a confluent 75-cm2 flask was replated in 24-well plates in medium containing 3.0 μCi/ml of [3H]myoinositol (PerkinElmer Life Sciences) in complete Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing no glutamine for another 24 h, followed by 1-h preincubation with 1× PhI buffer (120 mm NaCl, 0.5 mm CaCl2, 5 mm KCl, 5.6 mm glucose, 0.4 mmMgCl2, 20 mm LiCl in 25 mm PIPES buffer, pH 7.2). After removal of PhI buffer, cells were incubated for an additional 30 min with different concentrations ofl-glutamate in PhI buffer. The reactions were terminated by addition of 1 ml of acid-methanol (1:1000, v/v) per well. Total inositol phosphates were purified by chromatography on Dowex 1-X8 columns. To determine the domain(s) involved in mGluR1 dimerization, we sought to construct a truncated form of the mGluR1 lacking the ECD. The amino terminus of this truncated mutant (RhodC-R1) consisted of the first 20 amino acid residues of rhodopsin followed by the remainder of the mGluR1 beginning with residue 584. The rhodopsin N terminus tag was added, because it has been shown to enhance proper processing and cell surface expression of several GPCRs (20Krautwurst D. Yau K.W. Reed R.R. Cell. 1998; 97: 917-926Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (495) Google Scholar, 21Chandrashekar J. Mueller K.L. Hoon M.A. Adler E. Feng L. Guo W. Zuker C.S. Ryba N.J. Cell. 2000; 100: 703-711Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1067) Google Scholar). Next, the wild type mGluR1 and RhodC-R1 cDNAs were transiently transfected in HEK-293 cells, and after 48 h, whole cell extracts were prepared. To prevent non-specific disulfide bond formation during protein extraction, 10 mm iodoacetamide was included in the lysis buffer. On an immunoblot, as shown in Fig.1 A (left), under non-reducing conditions, a mGluR1-specific monoclonal antibody made against a carboxyl-terminal epitope detected two major bands of the wild type mGluR1 around ∼260- to 270-kDa molecular mass range and two fainter 130- and 135-kDa bands. The same four immunoreactive bands were also recognized by a mGluR1-specific polyclonal antibody (Fig. 1 B) and not detected in vector-transfected cells (data not shown). The intensity of the lower two 130- and 135-kDa bands varied from no immunoreactivity to faint immunoreactivity between different immunoblotting experiments. After reduction with β-mercaptoethanol, a majority of the wild type mGluR1 ∼260- to 270-kDa bands were reduced to a broad monomeric ∼133-kDa band, and a small portion remained as SDS-resistant dimeric aggregates. The RhodC-R1 mutant expression pattern revealed a major ∼90-kDa immunoreactive band, and the protein was expressed as a monomer, because the presence or absence of β-mercaptoethanol did not shift this band (Fig. 1 A, right).Figure 1Determination of cell surface expression of wild type mGluR1 and RhodC-R1 mutant receptors. Whole cell extracts were prepared from HEK-293 cells transiently transfected with either wild type (WT-R1) or with RhodC-R1 cDNAs. 20 μg of protein were loaded per lane with sample buffer containing no β-mercaptoethanol (−) or 300 mm β-mercaptoethanol (+) and fractionated on a 5% gel by SDS-PAGE (A). For the biotin-streptavidin labeling experiment (B), cell surface proteins were labeled with Biotin-7-NHS as described under “Materials and Methods.” The cell lysate was immunoprecipitated with an anti-mGluR1 monoclonal antibody (Transduction Laboratories), and proteins eluted with sample buffer containing no β-mercaptoethanol (−) were separated by SDS-PAGE. WT-R1 and RhodC-R1 mutant receptor bands were detected with anti-mGluR1 polyclonal antibody purchased from Chemicon (blot labeled Anti-mGluR1). These same bands of the WT-R1 and RhodC-R1 mutant receptors were detected with peroxidase-conjugated streptavidin (labeled Strep-POD) in a separate blot of the same samples. C, enzymatic deglycosylation studies with PNGase-F (second lane fromleft for WT-R1 or RhodC-R1 blot) and Endo-H (third lane from left for WT-R1 or RhodC-R1 blot) to identify asparagine-linked glycosylation states of WT-R1 and RhodC-R1 mutant receptors. 30 μl of whole cell extract of each sample was incubated without (−) or with PNGase-F (+) or with Endo-H (+) for 2 h at 37 °C. The reaction was stopped by adding sample buffer, and digested samples were analyzed under non-reducing condition by immunoblotting with anti-mGluR1 monoclonal antibody. The positions of molecular weight standards are indicated on the left for blots shown in A, B, and C. Similar results were seen in additional experiments with independent transfections and immunoblots.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) To further determine whether the dimeric mGluR1 and monomeric RhodC-R1 forms were expressed at the cell surface, cell surface proteins were labeled with membrane impermeant Biotin-7-NHS prior to lysing the cells. The wild type mGluR1 and the RhodC-R1 were then immunoprecipitated with anti-mGluR1 monoclonal antibody and eluted with gel loading sample buffer containing no β-mercaptoethanol. Immunoprecipitates were analyzed by SDS-PAGE, and immunoblots were stained either with streptavidin-POD to detect biotinylated cell surface proteins or with a mGluR1 polyclonal antibody to detect all the immunoreactive bands. As shown in Fig. 1 B, under non-reducing conditions, streptavidin-POD detected the upper ∼260- to 270-kDa dimeric bands but no visible 130- or 135-kDa monomeric bands of the mGluR1. Similarly, streptavidin-POD detected the 90-kDa band of the RhodC-R1 mutant. A duplicate blot of these samples with anti-mGluR1 polyclonal antibody detected all the immunoreactive bands of the wild type mGluR1 and RhodC-R1. mGluR1 ECD contains four potential asparagine-linked glycosylation sites (Asn-Xaa-Ser/Thr) and is shown to undergo glycosylation (11Robbins M.J. Ciruela F. Rhodes A. McLlhinney J. Neurochem. 1999; 72: 2539-2547Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar), and the RhodC-R1 mutant contains two potential asparagine-linked glycosylation sites within the rhodopsin tag sequence. Therefore, to determine further the biochemical identity of the ∼260- to 270-kDa dimeric bands of the wild type and the 90-kDa RhodC-R1 mutant receptors, we conducted deglycosylation experiments with two glycosidase enzymes, PNGase-F and Endo-H. The PNGase-F enzyme cleaves all asparagine-linked carbohydrates (both intermediate high mannose forms and fully processed complex carbohydrate forms) from glycoproteins (22Barsomian G.D. Johnson T.L.

Sensitivity to Endo-H digestion distinguishes between the fully processed mGluR1 forms that are modified with complex carbohydrates (Endo-H-resistant) and intermediate high mannose modified forms (Endo-H-sensitive), which have not trafficked from the endoplasmic reticulum to the Golgi (13Ray K.

As shown in Fig.1 C, under non-reducing conditions, whole cell extracts prepared from mGluR1- and RhodC-R1-transfected cells digested with PNGase-F showed a decrease in the size of both the ∼260- to 270-kDa bands of the wild mGluR1 and the 90-kDa band of the RhodC-R1 mutant receptors. However, these bands remained mostly resistant to Endo-H digestion. These data suggest that the dimeric wild type mGluR1 and monomeric RhodC-R1 receptors are expressed at the cell surface as asparagine-linked glycosylated and mostly fully processed receptor forms. We generated single C → S mutants of three cysteines at positions 67, 109, and 140 in the mGluR1 ECD. The C → S mutants were further analyzed by determining their dimerization patterns on immunoblots ran under non-reducing conditions. Transiently transfected cells expressing these mutant receptors were treated with iodoacetamide to prevent aggregates forming secondary to non-specific disulfide bond formation prior to crude membrane preparation. The membrane extracts were run on immunoblots, and immunoreactive bands were detected with an anti-mGluR1 monoclonal antibody. As seen in Fig.2 A, the wild type mGluR1 receptor expressed as two dimeric bands with little or no monomeric forms visible on immunoblot. C67S and C109S mutant receptors expressed predominantly as two 130- and 135-kDa monomeric forms, and one or two fainter upper dimeric band corresponding to the upper ∼260- to 270-kDa dimeric bands of the wild type mGluR1 were sometimes visible. These fainter dimeric bands were more visible when samples ran on gels by SDS-PAGE were enriched as crude membrane extracts or as immunoprecipitated samples but not routinely seen in whole cell extracts prepared from C67S- and C109S-transfected cells. Interestingly, C140S mutant receptor expressed as a broad ∼140-kDa monomeric band that ran at slightly higher molecular mass than the 130- and 135-kDa monomeric bands of C67S and C109S mutants and also generated a ∼300-kDa dimeric band. This dimeric band of the C140S mutant ran higher than the dimeric bands of the wild type mGluR1 or C67S or C109S mutant receptors. The intensities of the immunoreactive dimeric bands relative to the monomeric bands for each mutant receptor and wild type receptor were then measured by densitometric scanning (Table I). The data showed that C67S, C109S, and C140S mutant receptors expressed mostly as monomeric forms and generated a small amount of dimeric forms. In contrast, the wild type receptor expressed predominantly as dimers and generated a small amount of monomers. After reduction (Fig. 2 B), a majority of the dimeric ∼260- to 270-kDa bands of the wild type receptor were reduced to a broad monomeric ∼133-kDa band and a small portion remained as SDS-resistant dimeric aggregates, whereas the dimeric bands generated by C67S, C109S, and C140S mutant receptors remained mostly as SDS-resistant dimeric aggregates. Also, the 140-kDa monomeric band of the C140S mutant showed a small shift of molecular mass to a 133-kDa band like the wild type receptor. Taken together, the results suggest that substituting serine for cysteines 67, 109, and 140 directly or indirectly blocks dimerization.Table IDensitometric measurement of dimeric versus monomeric band intensities of the wild type, C67S, C109S, and C140S mutant receptors expressed transiently in HEK-293 cellsTransfectionImmunodetectable relative amountDimeric bandsMonomeric bandsWild type mGluR11.85 ± 0.040.15 ± 0.06C67S0.25 ± 0.051.36 ± 0.04C109S0.20 ± 0.061.42 ± 0.04C140S0.36 ± 0.041.30 ± 0.03Immunoblotting experiments were performed under non-reducing conditions as described in the legend of Fig 2 A.

Open table in a new tab Immunoblotting experiments were performed under non-reducing conditions as described in the legend of Fig 2 A. The intensities of the total dimeric and total monomeric immunoreactive bands on x-ray film were measured by densitometric scanning. The results are presented as the mean S.E. of six immunoblotting experiments. Because point mutations of three cysteine residues in mGluR1 generated monomeric receptors, we wanted to distinguish between properly processed cell surface versusintracellularly trapped monomeric forms. Cell surface proteins of the HEK-293 cells transiently transfected with wild type, C67S, C109S, and C140S mutant receptors were labeled with membrane impermeant Biotin-7-NHS. The whole cell extracts were immunoprecipitated with anti-mGluR1 monoclonal antibody, ran under non-reduced condition, and analyzed on immunoblots stained either with streptavidin-POD to detect biotinylated cell surface proteins or with anti-mGluR1 polyclonal antibody to detect total mGluR1 immunoreactive species. As seen in Fig.3 A, streptavidin-POD detected only the dimeric ∼260- to 270-kDa bands of the wild type mGluR1 and a fainter dimeric band of C67S and C109S mutants but no monomeric 130- to 135-kDa bands of these receptors. In contrast, streptavidin detected both the dimeric 300-kDa and monomeric 140-kDa bands of the C140S mutant receptor. A duplicate blot of the samples with anti-mGluR1 polyclonal antibody detected both the cell surface and the intracellular forms of the wild type and mutant receptors (Fig.3 A, anti-mGluR1 blot). To further determine the biochemical identity of the expressed bands of the C67S, C109S, and C140S mutant receptors, we tested for sensitivity to Endo-H digestion. Whole cell extracts prepared from HEK-293 cells transiently transfected with wild type, C67S, C109S, and C140S cDNAs were digested with Endo-H and analyzed by SDS-PAGE under non-reducing conditions. As seen in Fig.3 B, digestion with Endo-H caused no decrease in the sizes of the dimeric ∼260- to 270-kDa bands of the wild type mGluR1, which remained mostly resistant to Endo-H digestion. Whereas, both the lower 130- and 135-kDa bands of the wild type, C67S, and C109S mutant receptors showed sensitivity to Endo-H digestion with downward mobility shifts, indicating that these are intracellularly trapped, high mannose receptor forms. For the C140S mutant, however, both the 300- and 140-kDa bands were largely resistant to Endo-H digestion, and only a small fraction of both bands showed mobility shift after Endo-H digestion as shown by arrows in Fig. 3 B (right side). These results suggest that, of the different monomeric forms generated by C67S, C109S, or C140S mutants, only the 140-kDa monomeric form of C140S mutant receptor is expressed at the cell surface. The ability of the monomeric forms of the C140S mutant to express at the cell surface suggested that the Cys-140 residue is sufficient to form an intermolecular disulfide bond critical for dimerization. To further confirm this notion, we introduced ectopic cysteines at different positions on C140S mutant background to determine whether enforced apposition of these cysteine residues would rescue any dimeric receptor form from the C140S monomers. Band patterns of seven Cys-scanning mutants, namely S119C, S126C, S129C, K134C, D143C, T146K, and T152C generated on the C140S mutant background were analyzed under non-reducing conditions and compared with the wild type and C140S mutant receptors.

https://openalex.org/W2141094940,"A new protein was cloned and identified as the sixth member of the human origin recognition complex (ORC). The newly identified 30-kDa protein hsORC6 is 28% identical and 49% similar to ORC6p from Drosophila melanogaster, which is consistent with the identities and similarities found among the other ORC members reported in the two species. The human ORC6 gene is located on chromosome 16q12. ORC6 protein level did not change through the cell cycle. Like ORC1, ORC6 did not co-immunoprecipitate with other ORC subunits but was localized in the nucleus along with the other ORC subunits. Several cellular proteins co-immunoprecipitated with ORC6, including a 65-kDa protein that was hyperphosphorylated in G1 and dephosphorylated in mitosis. Therefore, unlike the tight stoichiometric association of six yeast ORC subunits in one holo-complex, only a small fraction of human ORC1 and ORC6 is likely to be associated with a subcomplex of ORC2, 3, 4, and 5, suggesting differences in the architecture and regulation of human ORC.

The human ORC6 gene is located on chromosome 16q12. ORC6 protein level did not change through the cell cycle. Like ORC1, ORC6 did not co-immunoprecipitate with other ORC subunits but was localized in the nucleus along with the other ORC subunits. Several cellular proteins co-immunoprecipitated with ORC6, including a 65-kDa protein that was hyperphosphorylated in G1 and dephosphorylated in mitosis. Therefore, unlike the tight stoichiometric association of six yeast ORC subunits in one holo-complex, only a small fraction of human ORC1 and ORC6 is likely to be associated with a subcomplex of ORC2, 3, 4, and 5, suggesting differences in the architecture and regulation of human ORC. origin recognition complex mini-chromosome maintenance Drosophila melanogaster ORC phosphate-buffered saline Initiation of eukaryotic DNA replication takes place at multiple sites in the genome. In yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae, a six protein origin recognition complex (ORC)1 binds to ARS consensus sequences in a sequence-specific manner (1Bell S.P. Stillman B.

Recombinant dmORC preparation can rescue the DNA replication activity of ORC depleted Xenopus and Drosophilaegg extracts (9Chesnokov I. Gossen M. Remus D. Botchan M. Genes Dev. 1999; 13: 1289-1296Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). Genetic experiments in Drosophila have shown that ORC2 and ORC3 are essential for DNA replication (10Landis G. Kelley R.

These results lead to the conclusion that ORC is essential for DNA replication in higher eukaryotes. However, in metazoans, the DNA sequences essential for replication initiation still remain elusive. The eukaryotic DNA replication model derived from the evidence in yeastS. cerevisiae suggests that ORC remains bound to origins of DNA replication throughout the cell cycle (12Diffley J.F.

Cell. 1997; 91: 59-69Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (640) Google Scholar). In G1, CDC6 is loaded on chromatin in ORC-dependent manner that in effect facilitates the assembly of MCM2–7 (13Aparicio O.M. Weinstein D.M. Bell S.P.

In vitro studies in Xenopus egg extracts also show that ORC recruits essential replication factors to the DNA (16Romanowski P. Madine M.A. Rowles A. Blow J.J. Laskey R.A. Curr.

Formation of this prereplicative complex is the key to initiate chromosomal DNA replication at the onset of S phase. Recently, inXenopus and in Schizosaccharomyces pombe, a protein, called CDT1, essential for DNA replication has been reported to be associated with the prereplicative chromatin in an ORC-dependent manner (18Maiorano D. Moreau J. Mechali M. Nature. 2000; 404: 622-625Crossref PubMed Scopus (294) Google Scholar, 19Nishitani H. Lygerou Z. Nishimoto T. Nurse P. Nature. 2000; 404: 625-628Crossref PubMed Scopus (368) Google Scholar). Like CDC6, CDT1 is also required for MCM loading on chromatin. As replication proceeds the MCM and CDC6 proteins are removed from the chromatin to prevent rereplication. Although conservation of structure and function is expected between yeast ORC and metazoan ORC, several differences have emerged. Five members of human ORC have been reported so far (11Pinto S.

HsORC1, 2, 4, and 5 have considerable homology with their yeast andDrosophila counterparts. HsORC3, in contrast, shows poor homology with yeast scORC3 but significant homology with dmORC3 (11Pinto S.

HsORC2, 3, 4, and 5 physically interact with each other, but biochemical interaction of hsORC1 with other hsORC subunits has not been established so far under endogenous levels of expression. InS. pombe, the N-terminal half of the spORC4 contains an AT-hook region that is unique to fission yeast (26Chuang R.Y. Kelly T.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

These discrepancies clearly suggest that the behavior of individual ORC subunits may not be conserved perfectly among different eukaryotic species, although collectively they may play a similar role in DNA replication. Here we report the cloning and expression of the sixth member of human ORC, the hsORC6 molecule homologous to dmORC6. Identifying hsORC6 will lead us to our ultimate goal of reconstituting the human ORC in vitro. Like hsORC3, the homology between scORC6 and hsORC6 is poor. Like ORC1, ORC6 did not interact with other ORC subunits under our experimental conditions. Therefore, the architecture of human ORC may be different from its yeast and Drosophila counterparts. We also found that several unidentified cellular proteins interact with hsORC6, which may be useful to get an insight on the function of human ORC. The ORC6 clone in expressed sequence tag 177464 contains the entire open reading frame except the first ATG. The CCATGG sequence was reconstituted by polymerase chain reaction primer mutagenesis, and the cDNA from the ATG to the 3′ end were cloned between EcoRI (5′) and XhoI sites of pBluescript SK(−), to give pSK-ORC6. The entire sequence was confirmed by automated sequencing of appropriate deletion constructs and use of a few synthetic primers. ORC6 cDNA from pSK-ORC6 was cloned in pET14b plasmid between NdeI andBamHI to express ORC6 protein fused to a His6epitope tag. The protein was produced in bacteria followed by purification on a nickel resin column. The purified protein was used to raise antibodies in rabbits (Co-calico Biologicals). Antibodies against human hsORC1, hsORC2, hsORC3, hsORC4, and hsORC5 have been described elsewhere (11Pinto S. Quintana D.G. Smith P. Mihalek R.M. Hou Z.H. Boynton S. Jones C.J. Hendricks M.

Immunoprecipitation and immunoblotting of cell lysates were carried out using standard protocols. Exponentially growing HeLa cells were arrested for 24 h with 40 ng/ml of nocodazole at M phase, with 10 mm hydroxyurea at early S phase, or with 5 μg/ml of aphidicolin at the G1/S transition point. For synchronization at G1, asynchronous cells were arrested for 36–48 h with mevastatin (10 μm). For metabolic labeling with [35S]methionine, cells were incubated for 2 h in medium lacking methionine and then incubated overnight in medium supplemented to a final concentration of 3 mm cold methionine plus 200 μCi (34 pm) of [35S]methionine (PerkinElmer Life Sciences; 1175 Ci/mmol) in the presence of respective drugs. For [32P]orthophosphate labeling of cellular proteins, synchronized cells were first incubated in phosphate-free medium for 2 h and then in medium containing 350 μCi (80 pm) of [32P]orthophosphate (PerkinElmer Life Sciences; 8500 Ci/mmol) for another 3 h in the presence of respective drugs before harvesting them. U2OS cells were fixed in 3% formaldehyde containing 2% sucrose at room temperature for 10 min, washed twice with phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) and permeabilized in Triton solution (3% bovine serum albumin, 0.5% Triton X-100 in PBS) for 5 min. Cells were then incubated at room temperature for 45 min with anti-ORC6 antibody (1:500 dilution) followed by three washes in 1× PBS. Finally cells were incubated with the secondary antibody (fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated swine anti-rabbit immunoglobulin G) at room temperature for 30 min followed by three washes with PBS. Cells were stained briefly with 4′,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole and photographed under a fluorescent microscope. 5 × 106 293T cells were lysed in 0.15 m Nonidet P-40 lysis buffer containing 50 mm Tris, pH 8.0, 0.1% Nonidet P-40, 150 mmNaCl, 50 mm NaF, 1 mmNa3VO4, 5 mm EDTA, 2 mmdithiothreitol, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 2 μg/ml pepstatin A, 2 μg/ml leupeptin, and 5 μg/ml aprotitin for 1 h at 4 °C. The lysate was then incubated at 37 °C for 15 min in the presence of 1000 units/ml DNaseI supplemented with 5 mm MgCl2. The lysate was centrifuged (15000 × g for 20 min at 4 °C) and filtered through a 0.22-μm filter. The filtrate was passed through fast protein liquid chromatography Superose 12 (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) column using lysis buffer at a flow rate of 0.2 ml/min. Alternate fractions were separated on 12% SDS-polyacrylamide gels and immunoblotted with anti-ORC2 and ORC6 antibodies. While searching the data base to get possible candidates for putative hsORC6 subunit, we found expressed sequence tags with considerable homology withDrosophila ORC6 subunit. The entire ORC6 sequence was reconstituted from two cDNA clones; IMAGE:199024 (H83116) and expressed sequence tag 177464 (AA306512). The entire sequence has been deposited in the data base by Dr. M. O'Donnell and co-workers (GenBankTM accession number NM014321), and the only difference is that the 5′ end of ORC6 begins from +9 of the deposited sequence (Table I). Ours is the first published report on this new ORC6 subunit. The cDNA encoded an open reading frame corresponding to 252 amino acids with a predicted molecular mass of ∼28 kDa. The predicted molecular mass is very close to that of dmORC6 (31 kDa) and a 29 kDa unidentified protein in xlORC (7Rowles A. Chong J.P. Brown L. Howell M. Evan G.I. Blow J.J.

The polypeptide is significantly homologous to the ORC6 subunit of Drosophila(28% identical and 49% similar) over the entire coding region (Fig.1, A and B). This degree of homology between hsORC6 and dmORC6 is in good agreement with the homology of other five human and Drosophila ORC subunits (Fig. 1 B). The homology of the Drosophila and human ORC6 subunit withS. cerevisiae ORC6 is low (5% identical and 19% similar; 6% identical and 15% similar, respectively) (Fig. 1, A andC). The S. pombe ORC6 is also significantly different from S. cerevisiae ORC6 (27Moon K.Y. Kong D. Lee J.K. Raychaudhuri S. Hurwitz J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 12367-12372Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). These results suggest that ORC6 has evolved faster than the other ORC subunits in eukaryotes.Table ISequences of exon-intron boundaries of ORC6Exon I (9–113)ttcgttgaccCGCGGCGTTC.….

BLAST search using the cDNA sequence of ORC6 showed a significant homology with a human BAC clone (accession number AC007225) located at chromosome 16q12. Comparing those two sequences we found the intron-exon boundaries of ORC6 (Table I). The mRNA is transcribed from 7 exons spanning over a 9-kilobase region in the genome. The nucleotide sequence analysis of genomic sequence upstream from the start site of the cDNA did not show any obvious E2F transcription factor binding site, suggesting that ORC6 mRNA level may not be cell-cycle regulated. This is consistent with the steady expression of other ORC subunits through the cell cycle but different from the promoters of ORC1 and CDC6, which have E2F binding sites and whose mRNA is cell cycle regulated (28Saha P.

To examine ORC6 protein in the cell extract, a polyclonal antiserum was raised against bacterially produced His6-tagged ORC6p. It recognizes the bacterially expressed His6-tagged antigen. The antiserum also recognizes a single 30-kDa protein in 293T cell extract (Fig. 2 A) that is very close to the predicted mass of 28 kDa. To examine whether ORC6 protein levels change through the phases of the cell cycle, HeLa cells were blocked at M phase using nocodazole and released over a time period of 24 h. Western blot analysis of protein samples at various stages of cell cycle clearly shows that the total level of ORC6p is not significantly changed throughout the cell cycle (Fig. 2 B). Normal progression of the cell cycle was indicated by the periodic expression of cyclin A, which is normally induced at the G1/S transition and degraded in M phase. The expression level of ORC2p is also not changed significantly over the same course of time (Fig. 2 B). ORC1p, ORC3p, ORC4p, and ORC5p expression levels also remain unchanged through the cell cycle (11Pinto S. Quintana D.G. Smith P. Mihalek R.M. Hou Z.H. Boynton S. Jones C.J. Hendricks M. Velinzon K.

We wanted to examine whether the newly identified putative human ORC6 physically interacts with other hsORC subunits. Immunoprecipitation of 293T cell extract using anti-ORC2 antibody specifically co-precipitated hsORC3, 4, and 5 subunits (Fig. 3). ORC6 was not immunoprecipitated by anti-ORC2 antibody under these experimental conditions. Similarly, ORC1 was also not present in the anti-ORC2 immunoprecipitates. Conversely, immunoprecipitation using anti-ORC6 antibody did not co-precipitate any of the other ORC subunits from 293T cell extract. Identical results were obtained from a HeLa cell line. ORC6 did not co-immunoprecipitate with any other ORC subunit under our extraction conditions. We were interested to see whether the majority of ORC6p exists as monomers or multimers in the cell. ORC6 could also be present in a larger complex with other ORC subunits without any stable direct interaction among them. To investigate these issues, a 293T cell extract (150 mm NaCl, 0.1% Nonidet P-40) was passed through Superose 12 gel filtration column. Alternate fractions were immunoblotted with anti-ORC6 antibodies (Fig.4). ORC6 peaked in fraction 21, consistent with a complex of 200 kDa, suggesting that either this protein is a multimer or associated with other cellular proteins. Although ORC2 level peaked at an earlier fraction (fraction 19) than ORC6, a reasonable quantity of ORC6 overlapped with ORC2 peak fraction. Therefore, there remains the theoretical possibility that small fractions of ORC2 and ORC6 proteins are part of a larger complex that is disrupted by immunoprecipitation with either anti-ORC2 or anti-ORC6 antibodies. Because ORC6 did not co-immunoprecipitate with other ORC subunits but still eluted as a larger complex, we were interested to see whether this protein interacted with other cellular proteins to understand how the protein is regulated or even linked to the replication apparatus. [35S]Methionine-labeled HeLa cell extracts prepared from asynchronous cells and cells blocked at the different stages of the cell cycle were immunoprecipitated using either anti-ORC6 antibody or preimmune serum. Besides the 30-kDa ORC6, polypeptides of 35, 40, 65, 68, 72, 80, and 115 kDa were present specifically in the immune lane (Fig. 5 A). None of these proteins were recognized by the anti-ORC6 antibodies in immunoblots, suggesting that these cellular proteins are not precipitated because of cross-reaction to anti-ORC6 antibody but are associated with hsORC6. To examine whether there was any change in ORC6 associated proteins in G1 versus M, mevastatin blocked cells (G1) were compared with nocodazole blocked cells (M). The same polypeptides were present in the immunoprecipitates in G1 or M. ScORC6 is highly phosphorylated in the G1 phase of the cell cycle by cyclin-Cdks (3Li j.J. Herskowitz I. Science. 1993; 262: 1870-1874Crossref PubMed Scopus (364) Google Scholar). Sequence analysis of ORC6 did not, however, show any obvious Cdk phosphorylation sites. To find out whether ORC6 is phosphorylated in a cell cycle-specific manner, we performed immunoprecipitation experiments using32PO4-labeled HeLa cell extracts prepared from cells blocked at the different stages of the cell cycle. ORC6 was very weakly phosphorylated, but its phosphorylation level did not change with the cell cycle (Fig. 5 B). There were several phospho-proteins of 35, 45, 60, 65, 70, and 80 kDa co-immunoprecipitated with ORC6. One phosphoprotein of 65 kDa was particularly prominent in the G1 phase of the cell cycle compared with M phase cells. A 65-kDa protein co-immunoprecipitated with ORC6 from [35S]methionine-labeled cell extracts, and the abundance of this protein was not changed to the same extent between G1 and M phase of the cell cycle (Fig.5 A). If the 65-kDa protein identified by [35S]methionine and 32PO4labeling is the same, then cell cycle-regulated phosphorylation of an ORC6-associated protein could be important for the regulation of ORC6. Because one component of the replication initiation complex, CDC6, changes intracellular localization through the phases of the cell cycle (28Saha P. Chen J. Thome K.C. Lawlis S.J. Hou Z.H. Hendricks M. Parvin J.D. Dutta A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 2758-2767Crossref PubMed Scopus (217) Google Scholar), we examined by immunofluroscence whether ORC6 was similarly regulated. Asynchronous culture of human U2OS osteosarcoma cells was immunostained using preimmune or anti-ORC6 antibody (Fig. 6). ORC6 is localized predominantly in the nucleus consistent with the nuclear localization of other ORC subunits. 2K. C. Thome and A. Dutta, unpublished results. The fact that ORC6 was constitutively nuclear in all cells in the asynchronous culture suggests that its intracellular localization was not regulated through the phases of the cell cycle. We report here the identification of a sixth member of the human origin recognition complex, ORC6. This protein is highly homologous to dmORC6. dmORC6 is part of the six-protein dmORC that is required for DNA replication in the Drosophila and Xenopus egg extract. Strong homology with Drosophila ORC6 and an equivalent mass of ∼30 kDa suggests that this is indeed the hsORC6 subunit. We also found that ORC6p does not co-immunoprecipitate with other ORC subunits under our experimental conditions. Although ORC subunits in yeast and early developmental stages of metazoa associate with each other in a stable holocomplex, the same is not true for mammalian ORCs from somatic cells. Endogenous hsORC2, 3, 4, and 5 subunits have been shown to interact with each other by co-immunoprecipitation experiments using human cell extract (11Pinto S. Quintana D.G. Smith P. Mihalek R.M. Hou Z.H. Boynton S. Jones C.J. Hendricks M. Velinzon K. Wohlschlegel J.A. Austin R.J. Lane W.S. Tully T. Dutta A.

This suggests that stable complex of six ORC may not be abundant in human somatic cells. ORC6p expression level and subcellular localization is not changed through the cell cycle. This finding is consistent with the constitutive expression pattern of all other ORC protein subunits through the cell cycle in human somatic cells (22Quintana D.G. Hou Z.H. Thome K. Hendricks M.

The G1-specific formation of the prereplication complex in yeast is attributed to the appearance of CDC6, which is conceptually similar to the nuclear localization of human CDC6 in G1. Hs ORC6 interacts with many unidentified cellular proteins. Identification of these proteins may help us to understand the function of ORC6 in human DNA replication and other cellular processes. Based on the hypothesis that human ORC will be fundamentally similar to the yeast, Drosophila, and Xenopus counterparts, it is likely that a complex of six subunits is created in mammalian cells at origins of replication in G1. The failure to isolate the complex may be due to the difficulties in extraction of some of the ORC subunits (23Quintana D.G. Thome K. Hou Z.H. Ligon A.H. Morton C.C. Dutta A. J. Biol.

ORC6-interacting proteins may then be crucial for bridging ORC6 with other ORC subunits on the chromatin in G1. One of the ORC6-interacting phosphoproteins is hyperphosphorylated during G1 phase of the cell cycle and this may be important for ORC6 regulation. The weak phosphorylation of human ORC6 contrasts with that of yeast ORC6. In addition, the latter is unphosphorylated in G1 and gets phosphorylated by Cdks at the onset of S phase (3Li j.J. Herskowitz I. Science. 1993; 262: 1870-1874Crossref PubMed Scopus (364) Google Scholar), whereas human ORC6 is constitutively phosphorylated through the G1/S transition. Of the other ORC subunits, human ORC2 is constitutively phosphorylated through the cell cycle,2 whereas human ORC1 is phosphorylated in M phase (30Tatsumi Y. Tsurimoto T. Shirahige K. Yoshikawa H. Obuse C. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 5904-5910Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). In summary, we have identified a putative hsORC6 molecule that is homologous to Drosophila ORC6. Although it does not interact with the other ORC subunits in vivo, it will lead us one step ahead to our ultimate goal of reconstituting the entire humanORC in vitro. The results so far indicate significant differences in the architecture and stability of human and yeast ORC and might predict differences in how replication is regulated in the two species.

Signaling through the Gi/Go family of G-proteins, the receptor subserves numerous homeostatic and central nervous system functions. A single nucleotide polymorphism of this receptor, which results in an Asn to Lys substitution at amino acid 251 of the third intracellular loop, was identified in the human population. The frequency of Lys-251 was 10-fold greater in African-Americans than in Caucasians, but was not associated with essential hypertension. To determine the consequences of this substitution, wild-type and Lys-251 receptors were expressed in CHO and COS-7 cells. Expression, ligand binding, and basal receptor function were unaffected by the substitution. However, agonist-promoted [35S]GTPγS binding was ∼40% greater with the Lys-251 receptor. This enhanced agonist function was observed with catecholamines, azepines, and imidazolines albeit to different degrees. In studies of agonist-promoted functional coupling to Gi, the polymorphic receptor displayed enhanced inhibition of adenylyl cyclase (60 ± 4.4 versus 46 ± 4.1% inhibition) and markedly enhanced stimulation of MAP kinase (57 ± 9 versus 15- ± 2-fold increase over basal) compared with wild-type α2AAR. The potency of epinephrine in stimulating inositol phosphate accumulation was increased ∼4 fold with the Lys-251 receptor. Unlike previously described variants of G-protein-coupled receptors, where the minor species causes either a loss of function or increased non-agonist function, Lys-251 α2AAR represents a new class of polymorphism whose phenotype is a gain of agonist-promoted function. α2A-Adrenergic receptors (α2AAR) are presynaptic autoinhibitory receptors of noradrenergic neurons in the central and peripheral sympathetic nervous systems, which act to dynamically regulate neurotransmitter release.

Cellular effects of α2AR activation include inhibition of adenylyl cyclase, activation of inwardly rectifying K+ channels, inhibition of voltage-gated Ca2+ channels, activation of phospholipase C, and stimulation of mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAP kinase) signaling (1Limbird L.E. FASEB J. 1988; 2: 2686-2695Crossref PubMed Scopus (277) Google Scholar, 2Luttrell L.M. van Biesen T. Hawes B.E. Della Rocca G.J. Luttrell D.K. Lefkowitz R.J. Goldstein D.S. Eisenhofer G. McCarty R.

Academic Press, New York1998: 466-470Google Scholar). α2ARs are widely expressed and participate in a broad spectrum of physiologic functions, including metabolic, cardiac, vascular, and central and peripheral nervous systems, via presynaptic and postsynaptic mechanisms. Three human α2AR subtypes have been cloned and characterized (α2A, α2B, and α2C) with the α2AAR being the most extensively expressed of the subtypes. At peripheral sites, α2AAR acts to inhibit insulin secretion by pancreatic β cells, contract vascular smooth muscle, inhibit lipolysis in adipocytes, modulate water and electrolyte flux in renal cells, and aggregate platelets (3Ruffolo Jr., R.R. Nichols A.J. Stadel J.M. Hieble J.P. Annu. Rev. Pharmacol. Toxicol. 1993; 32: 243-279Crossref Google Scholar). The α2AAR is the principal presynaptic inhibitory autoreceptor of central and peripheral sympathetic nerves (4Hein L. Altman J.D. Kobilka B.K. Nature. 1999; 402: 181-184Crossref PubMed Scopus (431) Google Scholar). Such inhibition of neurotransmitter release in the brain by the α2AAR is the basis for the central hypotensive, sedative, anesthetic-sparing, and analgesic responses of α2AR agonists (5Altman J.D.

Indeed, α2AR agonists such as clonidine and guanabenz are potent antihypertensive agents, which act via central presynaptic α2AARs (7Holmes B. Brogden R.N. Heel R.C. Speight T.M. Avery G.S. Drugs. 1983; 26: 212-229Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). The blood pressure and other responses to α2AR agonists and antagonists, however, are subject to interindividual variation in the human population (7Holmes B. Brogden R.N. Heel R.C. Speight T.M. Avery G.S. Drugs. 1983; 26: 212-229Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar, 8Dao T.T. Kailasam M.T. Parmer R.J. Le H.V. Le Verge R. Kennedy B.P. Ziegler G. Insel P.A. Wright F.A. O'Connor D.T. J.

Such variation, of course, could be due to genetic variation in the structure of the receptor itself, its cognate G-proteins, the effectors, or downstream intracellular targets. Of particular interest are physiologic (7Holmes B. Brogden R.N. Heel R.C. Speight T.M. Avery G.S. Drugs. 1983; 26: 212-229Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar, 8Dao T.T. Kailasam M.T.

Hypertension. 1996; 27: 1210-1215Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar) studies, which suggest that altered α2AAR function predisposes individuals to essential hypertension. Thus, like what has been shown with βAR polymorphisms (12Liggett S.B. Clin. Exp. Allergy. 1998; 28: 77-79Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), a functional polymorphism of the α2AAR may act as a risk factor for disease, act to modify a given disease, or alter the therapeutic response to agonists or antagonists. The above has prompted us to examine the α2AAR coding sequence for polymorphic variation in cohorts of hypertensive and normotensive individuals from two ethnic backgrounds. Here we report a single nucleotide polymorphism of the α2AAR that results in an Asn to Lys change at amino acid 251 in a coupling domain within the third intracellular loop of the receptor. This polymorphism was much more common in African-Americans than in Caucasians but was not associated with essential hypertension in either group. Surprisingly, recombinant studies revealed that the Lys-251 polymorphism confers significantly increased agonist-promoted binding to Giα, manifested functionally as enhanced coupling to the inhibition of adenylyl cyclase, activation of MAP kinase signaling, and stimulation of inositol phosphate accumulation. The intronless human α2AAR gene (GenBank™ accession number AF281308, which includes the sequence corrections illuminated by Guyer (13Guyer C.A. Horstman D.A. Wilson A.L. Clark J.D. Cragoe Jr., E.J. Limbird L.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 17307-17317Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar)) was amplified by overlapping PCR reactions from genomic DNA derived from blood samples. The 1350-bp coding sequence as well as 341-bp 5′-UTR and 174-bp 3′-UTR were examined. In this paper the adenine of the initiator ATG codon is designated as nucleotide 1, and amino acid 1 is the encoded methionine. The human receptor consists of 450 amino acids. For initial examination, DNA from 27 hypertensive individuals was utilized. Overlapping PCR products encompassing the α2A gene were designated fragments 1–5 and were generated using the following primers: Fragment 1 (600 bp), 5′-TTTACCCATCGGCTCTCCCTAC-3′ (sense) and 5′-GAGACACCAGGAAGAGGTTTTGG-3′ (antisense); Fragment 2 (467 bp), 5′-TCGTCATCATCGCCGTGTTC-3′ (sense) and 5′-CGTACCACTTCTGGTCGTTGATC-3′ (antisense); Fragment 3 (556 bp), 5′-GCCATCATCATCACCGTGTGGGTC-3′ (sense) and 5′-GGCTCGCTCGGGCCTTGCCTTTG-3′ (antisense); Fragment 4 (436 bp), 5′-GACCTGGAGGAGAGCTCGTCTT-3′ (sense) and 5′-TGACCGGGTTCAACGAGCTGTTG-3′ (antisense); and Fragment 5 (353 bp), 5′-GCCACGCACGCTCTTCAAATTCT-3′ (sense) and 5′-TTCCCTTGTAGGAGCAGCAGAC-3′ (antisense). The 5′-end of each sense and antisense primer also contained sequence corresponding to the M13 Forward (5′-TGTAAAACGACGGCCAGT) and M13 Reverse (5′-CAGGAAACAGCTATGACC) universal sequencing primers, respectively. The PCR consisted of ∼100 ng of genomic DNA, 5 pmol of each M13 primer, 0.8 mm dNTPs, 10% dimethyl sulfoxide, 2.5 units of Platinum taq DNA polymerase (Life Technologies, Inc.), 20 μl of 5× buffer A (Invitrogen) in a 100-μl reaction volume. Reactions were started by an initial incubation at 94 °C for 4 min, followed by 35 cycles of 94 °C for 30 s, denaturation for 30 s, and 72 °C for 1 min, followed by a final extension at 72 °C for 7 min. The denaturation temperature was 56 °C for fragments 1 and 5, 58 °C for fragments 2 and 4, and 60 °C for fragment 3. PCR reactions were purified using the QIAquick PCR purification system (Qiagen), and automated sequencing of both strands of each PCR product was performed using an Applied Biosystems sequencer using dye primer methods. As discussed below, a C to G transversion at nucleotide 753 was identified that resulted in an asparagine to lysine change at amino acid 251 (see Fig. 1). This nucleotide change resulted in gain of a unique StyI restriction endonuclease site in PCR fragment 3, and the presence or absence of this polymorphism in additional samples was studied by StyI digestion of fragment 3 PCR products (see Fig. 1 D). This rapid detection technique was applied to additional DNA samples providing genotypes at this locus from a total of 376 individuals (normotensive: 125 Caucasian and 99 African-American; hypertensive: 75 and 77, respectively). Normotensive and hypertensive patients were selected as described previously (14Rutkowski M.P. Klanke C.A. Su Y.R. Reif M. Menon A.G. Hypertension. 1998; 31: 1230-1234Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). To create the polymorphic α2A Lys-251 construct, a portion of the coding region of the α2AAR gene containing a G at nucleotide position 753 was amplified from a homozygous individual using fragment 2 sense and fragment 4 antisense primers (see PCR conditions described above). This fragment was digested with and subcloned into the BglII andSacII sites of the wild-type α2AAR sequence in the expression vector pBC12B1. Chinese hamster ovary cells (CHO-K1) were permanently transfected by a calcium phosphate precipitation technique as described previously using 30 μg of each receptor construct and 3.0 μg of pSV2neo to provide for G418 resistance (15Eason M.G. Liggett S.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 25473-25479Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Selection of positive clones was carried out in 1.0 mg/ml G418, and expression of the α2AAR from individual clonal lines was determined by radioligand binding as described below. Cells were grown in monolayers in Ham's F-12 medium supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum, 100 units/ml penicillin, 100 μg/ml streptomycin, and 80 μg/ml G418 (to maintain selection pressure) at 37 °C in a 5% CO2 atmosphere. COS-7 cells were co-transfected with 1–10 μg of each α2AAR construct and 5 μg of Giα2 using a DEAE-dextran method essentially as described previously (16Jewell-Motz E.A. Liggett S.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 18082-18087Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). These transfections also included 5 μg of the large T antigen-containing plasmid, pRSVT (17de chasseval R. de Villartay J.-P. Nucleic Acids Res. 1991; 20: 245-250Crossref Scopus (24) Google Scholar), to maximize expression of the α2AAR gene from the SV40 promoter of pBC12B1. α2AR inhibition of adenylyl cyclase was determined in membrane preparations from CHO cells stably expressing the two receptors using methods similar to those previously described (18Eason M.G. Moreira S.P. Liggett S.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 4681-4688Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar). Reactions consisted of 20-μg cell membranes, 2.7 mm phosphoenolpyruvate, 50 μmGTP, 0.1 mm cAMP, 0.12 mm ATP, 50 μg/ml myokinase, 0.05 mm ascorbic acid, and 2 μCi of [α-32P]ATP in a buffer containing 40 mmHEPES, pH 7.4, 1.6 mm MgCl2, and 0.8 mm EDTA for 30 min at 37 °C. Reactions were terminated by the addition of a stop solution containing excess ATP and cAMP and ∼100,000 dpm of [3H]cAMP. Labeled cAMP was isolated by gravity chromatography over alumina columns with [3H]cAMP used to quantitate column recovery. Activities were measured in the presence of water (basal), 5 μmforskolin, and 5 μm forskolin with the indicated concentrations of agonists. Results are expressed as percentage inhibition of forskolin-stimulated activity. Receptor-G-protein interaction was also quantitated by 35S-radiolabeled guanosine 5′-3-O-(thio)triphosphate ([35S]GTPγS) binding in COS-7 cells transiently transfected with each α2AAR construct and Giα2. Briefly, cell membranes (∼20 μg) were incubated in buffer containing 25 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 5 mm MgCl2, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 100 mm NaCl, 1 μm GDP, 2 nm [35S]GTPγS and the indicated agonist in a 100-μl reaction volume for 15 min at room temperature. Incubations were terminated by dilution with 4 volumes of ice-cold 10 mm Tris-HCl buffer (pH 7.4) and vacuum filtration over Whatmann GF/C glass fiber filters. Nonspecific binding was measured in the presence of 10 μm GTPγS. Activation of p44/42 MAP kinase was determined by quantitative immunoblotting using specific antibodies to identify phosphorylated and total MAP kinase expression. Briefly, confluent cells were incubated overnight in serum-free media prior to treatment with media alone (basal), epinephrine (10 μm), or thrombin (1 unit/ml) for 5 min. Cells were washed three times with phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) then lysed in RIPA (20 mmTris, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 1% Nonidet P-40, 0.5% deoxycholate, 0.1% SDS, and 5 mm NaF) containing protease inhibitors (10 μg/ml benzamidine, 10 μg/ml soybean trypsin inhibitor, 10 μg/ml aprotinin, and 5 μg/ml leupeptin). Western blots of these whole cell lysates were performed essentially as described previously (19Jewell-Motz E.A. Donnelly E.T. Eason M.G. Liggett S.B. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 15720-15725Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). Membranes were incubated with phospho-p44/42 MAP kinase E10 antibody (New England BioLabs, Beverly, MA) at a dilution of 1:2000 for 1 h at room temperature. Washed membranes were subsequently incubated with anti-mouse fluorescein-linked immunoglobulin followed by incubation with fluorescein alkaline phosphatase (ECF, Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). Fluorescent signals were quantitated by real-time acquisition using a Molecular Dynamics Storm imager. After stripping, membranes were incubated under the same conditions as above with a p44/42 MAP kinase monoclonal antibody to quantitate total MAP kinase expression. Total inositol phosphate levels in intact cells were determined essentially as described previously (20Schwinn D.A. Page S.O. Middleton J.P. Lorenz W. Liggett S.B. Yamamoto K. Caron M.G. Lefkowitz R.J. Cotecchia S. Mol. Pharmacol. 1991; 40: 619-626PubMed Google Scholar). Briefly, confluent CHO cells stably expressing each of the α2AARs were incubated with [3H]myoinositol (5 μCi/ml) in media lacking fetal calf serum for 16 h at 37 °C in 5% CO2 atmosphere. Subsequently, cells were washed and incubated with PBS for 30 min followed by a 30-min incubation with 20 mm LiCl in PBS. Cells were then treated with PBS alone (basal), varying concentrations of epinephrine, or 5 units/ml thrombin for 5 min, and inositol phosphates were extracted as described by Martin (21Martin T.F.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1983; 258: 14816-14822Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Following separation on Agl-X8 columns, total inositol phosphates were eluted with a solution containing 0.1 m formic acid and 1m formate. Expression of mutant and wild-type α2AAR was determined using saturation binding assays as described (22Eason M.G. Jacinto M.T. Theiss C.T. Liggett S.B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 11178-11182Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar) with 12 concentrations (0.5–30 nm) of [3H]yohimbine and 10 μm phentolamine used to define nonspecific binding. For competition studies, membranes were incubated in 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 10 mmMgSO4, 0.5 mm EDTA, with 2.0 nm[3H]yohimbine and 16 concentrations of the indicated competitor in the presence of 100 μm Gpp(NH)p for 30 min at 37 °C. Reactions for the above radioligand binding studies were terminated by dilution with 4 volumes of ice-cold 10 mmTris-HCl buffer (pH 7.4) and vacuum filtration over Whatmann GF/C glass fiber filters. Protein determinations were by the copper bicinchoninic acid method (23Smith P.K. Krohn R.I. Hermanson G.T. Mallia A.K. Gartner F.H. Provenzano M.D. Fujimoto E.K. Goeke N.M. Olson B.J. Klenk D.C. Anal. Biochem. 1985; 150: 76-85Crossref PubMed Scopus (18713) Google Scholar). Data from adenylyl cyclase and radioligand binding assays were analyzed by iterative least-square techniques using Prizm software (GraphPad, San Diego, CA). Agreement between genotypes observed and those predicted by the Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium was assessed by a Chi-squared test with one degree of freedom. Genotype comparisons were made using Fisher's exact test. Comparisons of results from biochemical studies were by pairedt tests, and significance was considered whenp < 0.05. Data are provided as means ± S.E. Sequence analysis of the entire coding region of the α2AAR gene from 54 chromosomes revealed one nonsynonymous sequence variant located within the third intracellular loop of the receptor (Fig. 1). This consisted of a C to G transversion at nucleotide 753 that changed amino acid 251 from Asn to Lys (Fig. 2). Although the Lys-251 receptor is relatively rare, it is ∼10-fold more common in African-Americans than in Caucasians, with an allele frequency of 0.05 as compared with 0.004 (p = 0.01). The distribution of homozygous and heterozygous alleles was not different than that predicted from Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium (p > 0.9). Two previously unreported synonymous single nucleotide polymorphisms were also identified at nucleic acids 849 (C to G) and 1093 (C to A). Considering the role of the α2AAR in regulating blood pressure, we also determined the frequency of this polymorphism in patients with essential hypertension. Our analysis of 99 normotensive and 77 hypertensive African-Americans as well as 125 normotensive and 75 hypertensive Caucasians showed no differences in the frequency of this polymorphism in patients with essential hypertension in either group. The consequences of this polymorphism on ligand binding and receptor function were evaluated by permanently expressing the human wild-type α2AAR and the Lys-251 polymorphic receptor in CHO cells. Saturation radioligand binding studies revealed essentially identical dissociation binding constants for the α2AR antagonist [3H]yohimbine (Kd = 3.4 ± 0.21versus 3.6 ± 0.25 nm, respectively,n = 4), and competition binding assays showed no differences in binding of the agonist (−) epinephrine (Ki = 593 ± 65 versus 734 ± 31 nm respectively, n = 3, Table I). These data confirm that the ligand binding pocket composed of the transmembrane spanning domains is not perturbed by the presence of Lys at amino acid 251 in the third intracellular loop.Table IPharmacological properties of the Asn-251 and Lys-251 α2AARs expressed in CHO cellsReceptorRadioligand BindingAdenylyl cyclase activityBmax[3H]YohimbineKdEpinephrineKiBasalForskolinfmol/mgnmpmol/min/mgAsn-2512360 ± 2633.4 ± 0.21593 ± 6511.9 ± 2.332.7 ± 4.0Lys-2512590 ± 1403.6 ± 0.25734 ± 3113.9 ± 1.631.6 ± 6.5 Open table in a new tab The Lys-251 polymorphism occurs in a highly conserved portion of the third intracellular loop of the α2AAR (Fig. 2), in a region thought to be important for G-protein interaction (24Eason M.G. Liggett S.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 12826-12832Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). Indeed, as shown in Fig. 2, Asn is present in the position analogous to human 251 in all mammalian α2AARs reported to date. To assess whether this polymorphism affects G-protein coupling, functional studies examining agonist-promoted inhibition of forskolin-stimulated adenylyl cyclase activities were carried out in cell lines expressing the wild-type Asn-251 receptor and the polymorphic Lys-251 receptor at levels of 2360 ± 263 and 2590 ± 140 fmol/mg (n = 5, p > 0.05), respectively. As shown in Table I, basal and 5.0 μm forskolin-stimulated adenylyl cyclase activities were not different between Asn-251- and Lys-251-expressing cell lines, indicating that non-agonist-dependent function is equivalent with the two receptors. However, activation of the polymorphic Lys-251 receptor with the full agonist epinephrine resulted in enhanced inhibition of adenylyl cyclase activity compared with wild-type α2AAR. Maximal inhibition of adenylyl cyclase was 60 ± 4.4% with the variant receptor compared with 46 ± 4.1% with wild-type (n = 5,p < 0.005, Fig. 3 A). Similar results were also found when receptors were activated by the partial agonist oxymetazoline, with the Lys-251 having an ∼40% augmented function compared with the Asn-251 receptor (50 ± 6.6% versus35 ± 4.7% inhibition, n = 5, p< 0.05, Fig. 3 B). No significant differences in the EC50 values for epinephrine (583 ± 196 nm versus 462 ± 145 nm) or for oxymetazoline (54.0 ± 7.3 nm versus 67.3 ± 15.7 nm) were observed. This enhanced function was also found by quantitating agonist-promoted receptor-Gi interaction with [35S]GTPγS binding. In these experiments, Asn-251 and Lys-251 receptors were transiently co-expressed in COS-7 cells (2.3 ± 0.3versus 2.2 ± 1.4 pmol/mg) along with Giα2. Of note, in the absence of co-transfected Gi, epinephrine promoted [35S]GTPγS binding was only 12 ± 2.6% over basal, compared with 57 ± 11% over basal when Giα2 was co-expressed. So, these studies primarily quantitate α2AAR-Giα2coupling as opposed to G-proteins, which are endogenously expressed in these cells. As is shown in Fig. 4, the Lys-251 receptor displayed increased [35S]GTPγS binding in response to all agonists tested, albeit to varying degrees. Basal [35S]GTPγS binding was equivalent. Stimulation with the full agonists UK-14304, epinephrine, and norepinephrine resulted in ∼40% enhanced GTPγS binding for the Lys-251 receptor as compared with the Asn-251 receptor. On the other hand, partial agonists displayed from 45% (BHT-933) up to 72% (guanabenz) enhancement of [35S]GTPγS binding with the Lys-251 receptor. These results are consistent with the adenylyl cyclase activity studies, which also showed enhanced function of the polymorphic receptor. In addition, they indicate that the gain-of-function phenotype is more pronounced with some, but not all, partial agonists compared with full agonists. We next investigated agonist-mediated modulation of MAP kinase by wild-type and the Lys-251 receptor. α2AR act to stimulate MAP kinase activity and thus can potentially regulate cell growth and differentiation (2Luttrell L.M. van Biesen T. Hawes B.E. Della Rocca G.J. Luttrell D.K. Lefkowitz R.J. Goldstein D.S. Eisenhofer G. McCarty R. Catecholamines: Bridging Basic Science with Clinical Medicine. Academic Press, New York1998: 466-470Google Scholar). Although noting that regulation of MAP kinase activity is both receptor and cell-type specific, MAP kinase activation by α2AAR receptors appears to be initiated by βγ released from Gi (2Luttrell L.M. van Biesen T. Hawes B.E. Della Rocca G.J. Luttrell D.K. Lefkowitz R.J. Goldstein D.S. Eisenhofer G. McCarty R. Catecholamines: Bridging Basic Science with Clinical Medicine. Academic Press, New York1998: 466-470Google Scholar). To investigate the extent of MAP kinase activation in CHO cell lines expressing both the Asn-251 and Lys-251 receptors, quantitative immunoblots using an antibody specific to the activated (phosphorylated) form of ERK 1/2 were performed. Although the total amount of MAP kinase was not different (Fig. 5 A), agonist-promoted stimulation of MAP kinase activity was markedly different between the two cell lines (Fig. 5, A and B). Activation of the Lys-251 receptor with 10 μm epinephrine resulted in a 57 ± 9-fold increase in MAP kinase activity over basal as compared with 15 ± 2.1-fold increase with the Asn-251 receptor (n = 3, p = <0.05). Finally, coupling of these two receptors to the stimulation of inositol phosphate production was examined. Such α2AR signaling is a complex response due to activation of phospholipase C by βγ released from activated Go and Gi (25Exton J.H. Annu. Rev. Pharmacol. Toxicol. 1996; 36: 481-509Crossref PubMed Scopus (300) Google Scholar). Maximal epinephrine-stimulated accumulation of inositol phosphates was not found to be different between Lys-251- and Asn-251-expressing cells (Fig. 6). However, the EC50was lower with the Lys-251 receptor (119 ± 36 nm) than the wild-type α2AAR (493 ± 21 nm,p < 0.05). Thus signaling to PLC is also enhanced with the polymorphic receptor based on this increase in agonist potency. α2AARs are widely expressed throughout the nervous system and peripheral tissues. Recent work with relatively selective agonists and antagonists, radiolabels, and specific molecular probes in several species, including genetically engineered mice, have begun to elucidate specific functions for the various α2AR subtypes (26MacMillan L.B. Lakhlani P. Lovinger D. Limbird L.E. Recent Prog. Horm. Res. 1998; 53: 25-42PubMed Google Scholar). The latter studies have been particularly useful in identifying subtype-specific functions. Mice lacking α2AAR have higher resting systolic blood pressures and more rapidly develop hypertension with sodium loading after subtotal nephrectomy than wild-type mice (27Makaritsis K.P. Johns C. Gavras I. Altman J.D. Handy D.E. Bresnahan M.R. Gavras H. Hypertension. 1999; 34: 403-407Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). Furthermore, these α2AAR knock-out mice fail to display a hypotensive response to the agonist dexmedetomidine (5Altman J.D. Trendelenburg A.U. MacMillan L. Bernstein D. Limbird L. Starke K. Kobilka B.K. Hein L. Mol. Pharmacol. 1999; 56: 154-161Crossref PubMed Scopus (285) Google Scholar). Heart rates in these mice were increased at rest, which correlated with increased [3H]norepinephrine release from cardiac sympathetic nerves. These data thus indicate 1) that the presynaptic inhibition of neurotransmitter release in cortical and cardiac nerves serves important homeostatic functions in blood pressure and cardiac function, and 2) that the physiologic effects of therapeutic agonists such as clonidine reduce blood pressure by specifically acting at the α2AAR subtype. The lack of a hypotensive effect of α2AR agonists has also been shown in genetically altered (hit-and-run) mice expressing a dysfunctional α2AAR (D79N) (28MacMillan L.B. Hein L. Smith M.S. Piascik M.T. Limbird L.E. Science. 1996; 273: 801-805Crossref PubMed Scopus (449) Google Scholar). These mice also responded poorly to α2AR agonists for several other physiologic functions (6Lakhlani P.P. MacMillan L.B. Guo T.Z. McCool B.A. Lovinger D.M. Maze M. Limbird L.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 9950-9955Crossref PubMed Scopus (304) Google Scholar). Dexmedetomidine failed to reduce rotarod latency or induce prolongation of sleep time, to enhance the efficacy of halothane, or to attenuate thermally induced pain in these mice. Thus the sedative, anesthetic-sparing, and analgesic effects of α2AR agonists are due to activation of the α2AAR subtype. Indeed, these physiologic defects correlated with absent α2AAR regulation of inwardly rectifying K+ channels of locus ceruleus neurons and voltage-gated Ca2+ channels of these same neurons, as well as those of the superior cervical ganglion (6Lakhlani P.P. MacMillan L.B. Guo T.Z. McCool B.A. Lovinger D.M. Maze M. Limbird L.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 9950-9955Crossref PubMed Scopus (304) Google Scholar). The above studies indicate that a polymorphism resulting in a markedly depressed α2AAR function in humans would likely be of physiologic importance. Indeed, such a polymorphism might well be a significant risk factor for hypertension. However, the one coding block polymorphism that we found in Caucasians and African-Americans is not associated with essential hypertension and in fact its phenotype is again of function. It should be noted that with our sample size we have the power to detect a polymorphism with an allele frequency of 0.04 with a statistical certainty of 90%, thus it is unlikely that we have failed to detect another polymorphism that is common in any of the cohorts. Based on the phenotype of the Lys-251 receptor, and the known physiologic function of the α2AAR, one might predict that the polymorphism would predispose to autonomic dysfunction characterized by hypotension and bradycardia. Similarly, patients with essential hypertension who have the polymorphism may have milder disease or display enhanced efficacy of antihypertensive agents such as clonidine or guanabenz. Interestingly, these individuals may display more pronounced central nervous system side-effects from these agents, such as sedation, which could ultimately limit their therapeutic utility. Finally, the hyperfunctioning polymorphism would be predicted to result in less norepinephrine release from cardiac sympathetic nerves, thereby potentially providing protection against the deleterious effects of catecholamines in patients with heart failure. These scenarios await explicit testing. Mutations of G-protein-coupled receptors are the basis of a number of rare diseases (29Spiegel A.M. Annu. Rev. Physiol. 1996; 58: 143-170Crossref PubMed Scopus (188) Google Scholar). In contrast, polymorphisms (allele frequencies >1%) of these receptors have been identified, which can be minor risk factors for complex diseases (30Kotanko P. Binder A. Tasker J. DeFreitas P. Kamdar S. Clark A.J. Skrabal F. Caulfield M. Hypertension. 1997; 30: 773-776Crossref PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar), but more importantly act as disease modifiers (31Liggett S.B. Wagoner L.E. Craft L.L. Hornung R.W. Hoit B.D. McIntosh T.C. Walsh R.A. J. Clin. Invest. 1998; 102: 1534-1539Crossref PubMed Scopus (310) Google Scholar) or alter response to therapeutic agents targeting the receptor (32Tan S. Hall I.P. Dewar J. Dow E. Lipworth B. Lancet. 1997; 350: 995-999Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (331) Google Scholar). Interestingly, when such mutations or polymorphisms have been found to alter function, the minor allelic variant (i.e. the least common form of the receptor) results in either decreased agonist-promoted function or increased non-agonist-dependent function (i.e.constitutive activation). An example of the former is the Ile-164 polymorphisms of the β2AR, which imparts defective agonist-promoted coupling to Gs (33Green S.A. Cole G. Jacinto M. Innis M. Liggett S.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 23116-23121Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Constitutive activation results in receptors adopting a mutation-induced agonist-bound like state and thus signaling becomes independent of agonist. Such persistent activation is the pathologic basis for diseases such as male precocious puberty, which is due to a mutation in the leutinizing hormone receptor (34Shenker A. Laue L. Kosugi S. Merendino J.J. Minegishi T. Cutler G.B. Nature. 1993; 365: 652-654Crossref PubMed Scopus (661) Google Scholar). In the current report we show that the Lys-251 receptor does not exhibit constitutive activation, based on wild-type [3S]GTPγS binding, adenylyl cyclase, and MAP kinase activities in the absence of agonist. Instead, the phenotype that we observed was one of increasedagonist-promoted function. To our knowledge this is the first delineation of a polymorphism of a pharmacogenetic locus of any G-protein-coupled receptor where the minor allele displays this property, and thus this represents a new class of polymorphism for the superfamily.

The leading strand is synthesized in a continuous fashion in lengths that in Escherichia coli can be in excess of 2 megabases. On the other hand, the lagging strand is synthesized in relatively short stretches of 2 kilobases. Nevertheless, identical assemblies of the DNA polymerase III core tethered to the β sliding clamp account for both modes of DNA synthesis. Yet the same lagging strand polymerase accounts for the synthesis of all Okazaki fragments at a replication fork, cycling repeatedly every 1 or 2 s from the 3′-end of the just-completed fragment to the 3′-end of the new primer. Several models have been invoked to account for the rapid cycling of a polymerase complex that can remain bound to the template for upward of 40 min. By using isolated replication protein-DNA template complexes, we have tested these models and show here that cycling of the lagging strand polymerase can be triggered by either the action of primase binding to the replisome and synthesizing a primer or by collision of the lagging strand polymerase with the 5′-end of the previous Okazaki fragment.

Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1992; 61: 673-719Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Efficiency of such a high degree bespeaks an ordered and cooperative process whereby individual catalytic activities operate synchronously, informed by the actions of one another. In support of this, several protein-protein interactions have been found to be crucial to replisome function by contributing both paths of information transfer and gains in enzymatic efficiency. The τ subunit of the DNA polymerase III holoenzyme (Pol III HE)1 forms the central core of the replisome. Interactions between τ and the α subunit of the polymerase core hold the leading and lagging strand polymerases together (2Kim S. Dallmann H.G. McHenry C.S. Marians K.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 21406-21412Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). This ensures, as proposed originally by Alberts and colleagues (3Sinha N.K. Morris C.F. Alberts B.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1980; 255: 4290-4303Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), that when the lagging strand polymerase dissociates from a completed Okazaki fragment, it remains at the replication fork where it can be rapidly targeted to the next primer. An interaction between τ and DnaB, the replication fork DNA helicase (4LeBowitz J.H. McMacken R. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 4738-4748Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), allows rapid replication fork movement (5Kim S. Dallmann H.G. McHenry C.S. Marians K.J. Cell. 1996; 84: 643-650Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (305) Google Scholar) and, by preventing cycling of β from the core-β complex (6Kim S. Dallmann H.G. McHenry C.S. Marians K.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 4315-4318Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar), defines which of the two polymerase assemblies becomes the leading strand polymerase (6Kim S.

Cell. 1996; 86: 877-886Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar). The β clamp-loading γ-complex is anchored to the replication fork because τ and γ form a heterotetramer (8Dallmann H.G. McHenry C.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 29563-29569Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar, 9Onrust R. Finkelstein J. Turner J. Naktinis V. O'Donnell M. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 13337-13366Google Scholar). Interactions involving other fork components are important as well. Primase is attracted to the replisome via an interaction with DnaB (10Tougu K. Peng H. Marians K.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 4675-4682Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The affinity of this interaction has been shown to govern Okazaki fragment size (11Tougu K. Marians K.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 21398-21405Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar). An interaction between primase and the Pol III HE limits the size of primers synthesized at the fork to 12 nucleotides (12Zechner E.L. Wu C.A. Marians K.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 4054-4063Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Recent findings show that an interaction between primase, χ, a subunit of the clamp-loading γ-complex (13Maki S. Kornberg A. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 6555-6560Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), and the single-stranded DNA-binding protein (SSB) may be important for the handoff of the primer from primase to the polymerase (14Yuzhakov A. Kelman Z. O'Donnell M. Cell. 1999; 96: 153-163Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (189) Google Scholar). This interaction could possibly account for the previously observed primer size limitation. Perhaps the major gain of efficiency attained by the replisome is the repeated cycling of the lagging strand polymerase. This is a remarkable achievement, because to do so, another major gain in efficiency, that generated by β clamping α to the DNA topologically to form a polymerase with a processivity that can be measured in megabases, must be subverted to accommodate the relatively short size of Okazaki fragments synthesized on the lagging strand. This mechanism itself must also be highly efficient because the entire process of binding to the 3′-end of a primer, synthesizing an Okazaki fragment, and cycling to the next primer occurs in about 2 s. Considerable investigation using replication systems reconstituted with purified proteins has been devoted to attempting to define the lagging strand polymerase cycling mechanism. Currently there are two models describing this process. It has been demonstrated that in both the cases of the E. coli (14Yuzhakov A. Kelman Z. O'Donnell M. Cell. 1999; 96: 153-163Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (189) Google Scholar) and bacteriophage T4 DNA polymerase holoenzymes (16Hacker K.J. Alberts B.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 24209-24220Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 17Hacker K.J. Alberts B.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 24221-24228Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), the sliding clamp will not dissociate from the polymerase subunit when the polymerase is stalled because of the absence of substrate but does dissociate immediately when the polymerase encounters the 5′-end of a DNA strand annealed to the template, a situation identical to what happens when the lagging strand polymerase completes synthesis of the current Okazaki fragment and encounters the 5′-end of the penultimate fragment. These authors (14Yuzhakov A. Kelman Z. O'Donnell M. Cell. 1999; 96: 153-163Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (189) Google Scholar, 16Hacker K.J. Alberts B.M. J. Biol.

Chem. 1994; 269: 24221-24228Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) suggested that it is this encounter that triggers cycling of the lagging strand polymerase. Albertset al. (18Alberts B.M. Barry J. Bedinger P. Formosa T. Jongeneil C.V. Kreuzer K.N. Cold Spring Harbor Symp. Quant. Biol. 1983; 47: 655-668Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) have argued as well that dissociation of the lagging strand polymerase would also be the signal for primase to initiate synthesis of the next primer. We have shown that primase acts distributively at the replication fork (19Wu C.A. Zechner E.L. Marians K.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 4030-4044Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), with a new primase molecule synthesizing each primer, and that it is the period of this cycle, set by the affinity of the primase-DnaB interaction (11Tougu K. Marians K.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 21398-21405Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar), that governs the size of Okazaki fragments. Because essentially all variations in Okazaki fragment size could be understood as either a change in the frequency of primer synthesis or the efficiency with which the primers were used to initiate lagging strand synthesis (20Zechner E.L. Wu C.A. Marians K.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 4045-4053Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), we proposed that it was primase action that triggered cycling of the lagging strand polymerase (21Wu C.A. Zechner E.L. Reems J.A. McHenry C.S. Marians K.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 4074-4083Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In this report, using isolated replisome complexes, we developed conditions to test each of these models. To test primase-directed cycling, conditions were developed where there was no Okazaki fragment for the lagging strand polymerase to run into downstream of the point of synthesis of the first primer at the replication fork, although there was available template. Under these conditions, the lagging strand polymerase started cycling immediately when primase was added, thus indicating that either the binding of primase to the replisome or the synthesis of a primer was a trigger for lagging strand polymerase cycling. This observation also explains how cycling of the lagging strand polymerase is initiated directly after replication fork assembly. To test the collision-directed cycling model, we developed conditions where, in the absence of primase, the only available primers for lagging strand synthesis were synthetic oligonucleotides annealed to the lagging strand template. In this situation, the lagging strand polymerase was shown to be able to find these primers and use them to initiate Okazaki fragment synthesis, thus validating collision of the polymerase with a 5′-end as a trigger for cycling of the lagging strand polymerase as well. ΦX-type primosomal proteins were purified as described (22Marians K.J. Methods Enzymol. 1995; 262: 507-521Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). Pol III HE subassemblies and subunits (the kind gift of Charles McHenry, University of Colorado) were as indicated (2Kim S. Dallmann H.G. McHenry C.S. Marians K.J. J. Biol.

Standard rolling circle reaction mixtures (12 μl) containing 50 mm Hepes-KOH (pH 7.9), 12 mm MgOAc, 10 mm dithiothreitol, 5 μm ATP, 80 mm KCl, 0.1 mg/ml bovine serum albumin, 1.1 μm SSB, 0.42 nm TFII DNA, 3.2 nmDnaB, 56 nm DnaC, 680 nm DnaG, 28 nm DnaT, 2.5 nm PriA, 2.5 nm PriB, 2.5 nm PriC, and 28 nm Pol III HE were incubated at 30 °C for 2 min. NTPs were added to final concentrations of 1 mm ATP, 200 μm GTP, 200 μm CTP, and 200 μm UTP, and dNTPs to 40 μm, and the reaction was then incubated for 2 min at 30 °C (stage 1). [α-32P]dATP (2000–4000 cpm/pmol) was added to the reaction mixture, and the incubation was continued at 30 °C for an additional 10 min (stage 2). Reactions were terminated by the addition of EDTA to 50 mm, and analysis was by alkaline-agarose gel electrophoresis as described (19Wu C.A. Zechner E.L. Marians K.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 4030-4044Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). To form and isolate replisome complexes, reaction mixtures (120 μl) containing 50 mm Hepes-KOH (pH 7.9), 10 mm MgOAc, 10 mm dithiothreitol, 5 μm ATP, 80 mm KCl, 100 μg/ml bovine serum albumin, 0.42 nm TFII, 550 nm SSB, 7 nm DnaB, 56 nm DnaC, 240 nm DnaG, 38 nm DnaT, 2.5 nm PriA, 2.5 nm PriB, 50 nmPriC, and 28 nm Pol III HE reconstituted from purified subunits were incubated at 30 °C for 3 min and then loaded onto a 10-ml Bio-Gel A-50M (0.6 × 34 cm) column previously equilibrated with 62.5 mm Hepes-KOH (pH 7.9), 15 mm MgOAc, 12.5 mm dithiothreitol, 100 mm KCl, 125 μg/ml bovine serum albumin, and 6.3 μm ATP. The column was developed at room temperature with the same buffer at 25 ml/h, and 0.2-ml fractions were collected. Protein-DNA complexes eluted at fractions 20–22, whereas free Pol III HE and DnaB, the two largest proteins in the reaction mixture, eluted at fractions 35–50, and 39–56, respectively (see also Kim et al.

When added, DnaG was present at 240 nm,and the leading strand probe oligonucleotide (see below) was present at 1.6 μm. Reactions were terminated by the addition of EDTA to 50 mm, and analysis was by alkaline-agarose gel electrophoresis as described (19Wu C.A. Zechner E.L. Marians K.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 4030-4044Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Gels were soaked in 1.5 liters of 0.25m KCl for 30 min at room temperature, rinsed with H2O, and then soaked in 0.4 m NaOH for 10 min at room temperature. DNA was bound to an Amersham Pharmacia Biotech N+ membrane by upward capillary transfer for 3 h at room temperature. The membrane was washed twice with 100 ml of 2× SSC and then incubated in 10 ml of prehybridization solution (5× SSC, 5× Denhardt's solution, 0.5% SDS, 100 μg/ml calf thymus DNA) for 2 h at 45 °C. 5′ 32P probes were then added, and the incubation was continued for an additional 12 h. The membrane was then washed twice in 800 ml of 0.1× SSC, 0.1% SDS and autoradiographed. The probe to detect leading strand DNA was 5′-ATGAGGATCCATTCGTTTGTGAATATCAAG-3′, and the probe to detect lagging strand DNA was 5′-CTTGATATTCACAAACGAATGGATCCTCAT-3′. These represent sequences about the BamHI site in f1R229-A/33 DNA (24Mok M. Marians K.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 16644-16654Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). To assess whether primase could direct cycling of the lagging strand polymerase at the E. coli replication fork, we asked whether the lagging strand polymerase could cycle off the 3′-end of the nascent DNA if there was no 5′-end available from the previous Okazaki fragment for it to collide with. If such a collision served as the only trigger for cycling, the answer should be no. On the other hand, if cycling could be triggered by some other event, such as the association of primase with the replisome, then lagging strand polymerase cycling should be observed. The test that we developed is described in Fig.1. The lagging strand polymerase has to cycle from the 3′-end of the just-completed Okazaki fragment to the new primer for synthesis of the next Okazaki fragment (Fig. 1 A). Under most experimental conditions, there will always be another Okazaki fragment downstream from the active lagging strand polymerase. Thus, it becomes difficult to distinguish one trigger event from another. However, we established conditions where the lagging strand polymerase bound to the first primer synthesized at the replication fork had only template available downstream from it; no previous Okazaki fragments existed. When primase synthesized the second primer, the lagging strand polymerase was therefore presented with a choice (Fig. 1 B): either cycle to the new primer, thereby producing small Okazaki fragments of normal size or continue synthesis of the first Okazaki fragment until it ran off the end of the template, thereby producing an Okazaki fragment that was unusually long.Figure 1Experimental design to test primase-directed cycling of the lagging strand polymerase. The jagged lines represent primers synthesized by primase, the solid lines with arrowheads are Okazaki fragments, and therectangles are the lagging strand polymerases. Thesolid lines with tick marks represent the lagging strand templates, and the tick marks represent the spacing of primers on the template as determined by the period of the cycle of primase association and dissociation with the replication fork (11Tougu K.

Cell. 1994; 77: 157-166Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar), as well as that from E. coli (24Mok M. Marians K.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 16644-16654Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Specialized TFII DNAs are utilized as templates that support rolling circle DNA synthesis in the presence of all the replication fork components (Fig. 2). These replication systems accurately mimic their counterparts in vivo. Moreover, the products of rolling circle DNA replication are cleanly resolved by denaturing alkaline-agarose gel electrophoresis into a large leading strand population that barely enters the gel and a population of Okazaki fragments that, for the E. coli system (19Wu C.A. Zechner E.L. Marians K.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 4030-4044Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), is typically centered at about 1.5–2.5 kb in length. These rolling circle replication systems are engineered for maximum efficiency of nucleotide incorporation; thus the enzymatic components are typically in considerable excess over the substrate. For example, in our E. coli system, the HE is in 66-fold excess over the TFII DNA. This creates a problem for testing the ability of primase to direct cycling of the lagging strand polymerase as described in Fig. 1. That is, if free 3′-ends are generated at the replication fork, as would be the case as described in Fig. 1, they can be elongated by the free polymerase in the reaction mixture. This, of course, would lead to inaccurate conclusions about what was actually happening at the replication fork. To circumvent this problem, we used replisome complexes that had been separated from free replication proteins. Incubation of the Pol III HE, SSB, the preprimosomal proteins (PriA, PriB, PriC, DnaT, DnaB, and DnaC), and the TFII DNA template in the presence of 5 μm ATP results in the formation of a stable replisome complex on the DNA that can be isolated by chromatography through a Biogel A50M column equilibrated with the same reaction buffer (2Kim S. Dallmann H.G. McHenry C.S. Marians K.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 21406-21412Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). Assays designed to detect both free Pol III HE and DnaB (at ∼1 MDa and 312 kDa, respectively, the largest proteins in the reaction mixture) have demonstrated that the protein-DNA complex isolated in the void volume is completely separated from free DNA replication proteins (2Kim S. Dallmann H.G. McHenry C.S. Marians K.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 21406-21412Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). This complex has been shown to be capable of supporting coupled leading and lagging strand synthesis that is resistant to 100-fold dilution. Thus, it contains a dimeric DNA Pol III HE and at least the DnaB protein. (The presence of the other preprimosomal proteins has not been assessed.) To be able to perform the experiment described in Fig. 1, these isolated replisome complexes should synthesize only leading strand DNA if supplied with dNTPs and a high concentration of ATP and both leading and lagging strand DNA if primase and the other three NTPs are also provided. We therefore tested the activity of isolated replisome complexes in comparison with standard replication reactions (Fig. 2). In each case, the reaction was followed kinetically for the first 2 min of incubation in both the presence and absence of primase. The results with isolated replisomes (Fig. 2 B) were comparable with those observed with standard reactions (Fig. 2 A). The replication forks formed in either case moved at roughly the same rates in a manner that was not influenced by the presence of primase. In addition, only leading strand synthesis was observed in the absence of primase (Fig. 2, A and B, lanes 1–4), whereas both leading and lagging strand synthesis was observed in the presence of primase (Fig. 2, A and B, lanes 5–8). These data confirmed that the isolated replisomes behaved in the expected manner. This is consistent with our previously published observations (2Kim S. Dallmann H.G. McHenry C.S. Marians K.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 21406-21412Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). To develop the conditions required for the experiment described in Fig.1, we took advantage of the facts that during rolling circle DNA synthesis, the nascent leading strand is the lagging strand template, and, as shown in Fig. 2, that the presence of primase is not required to assemble replisomes on the template that are capable of coupled leading and lagging strand synthesis (2Kim S. Dallmann H.G. McHenry C.S. Marians K.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 21406-21412Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar, 19Wu C.A. Zechner E.L. Marians K.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 4030-4044Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Thus, isolated replisome complexes were recovered by gel filtration as described above, followed by a 3-min incubation in the presence of deoxynucleotides, β, and SSB. Because the latter two proteins act distributively at the replication fork, they are not recovered in the fractions containing the isolated replisome and thus must be restored to subsequent replication reactions. Because these replication forks synthesize DNA at about 700 nucleotides/s (24Mok M. Marians K.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 16644-16654Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), this initial 3-min incubation generates a long lagging strand template in excess of 100 kb in length. The addition of primase and the synthesis of the first primer on the lagging strand template now presents the lagging strand polymerase with the cycling dilemma described in Fig. 1. If collision with the previous Okazaki fragment was required to effect polymerase cycling, we would expect to observe the synthesis of an exceedingly long Okazaki fragment before any typically sized Okazaki fragments of 2 kb in length were evident. On the other hand, if cycling of the lagging strand polymerase could be triggered by the binding of primase to the replisome, we would expect to observe only the synthesis of Okazaki fragments 2 kb in length. The results of such an experiment are shown in Fig.3. Rolling circle replication reactions using isolated replisomes were initiated in the absence of both primase and [α-32P]dATP and incubated for 3 min. The reaction mixture was then divided in two, primase was added to one half, label was added to both halves, and aliquots of the reaction mixtures were then withdrawn during the subsequent 2 min of incubation. Only two distinct types of DNA species were observed (Fig. 3 A): large leading strand DNA that migrated to the exclusion limit of the gel and a population of typically sized Okazaki fragments centered about 1.8 kb in length. (Note that because the radioactivity present in the Okazaki fragment population is distributed over a large region of the gel, the lagging strand products can be difficult to visualize early in the reaction, even though the leading strand DNA, which is concentrated in a tight band, can be visualized easily.) There was no indication of any additional DNA population representing a nascent lagging strand increasing synchronously in length to large size as the incubation progressed. To prove that the 3′-OH end of the first Okazaki fragment was, in fact, free and available for extension by the HE, we repeated the experiment shown in Fig. 3 A but this time added back additional HE with the primase. If, in these experiments, the association of primase with the fork directed the lagging strand polymerase in the replisome to dissociate from the 3′-OH end of the first Okazaki fragment and move to a new primer terminus, then the additional HE should be able to detect the free 3′-OH end and extend it the length of the available template. This proved to be the case (Fig. 3 B). In the presence of primase and additional holoenzyme, a new DNA species was now evident that increased in length as a function of time (Fig.3 B, lanes 7–10). The appearance of this DNA product was dependent on the presence of primase, indicating that primers had to be synthesized and arguing that it represented elongation from the 3′-OH end of the first Okazaki fragment. An alternative explanation, that primase was binding to the SSB-coated single-stranded DNA tail and synthesizing primers that were elongated by the free HE added to the reaction, can be discounted. (i) The specific activity of primase-catalyzed primer synthesis on single-stranded DNA in the absence of DnaB is one three-hundredth of that in its presence (10Tougu K. Peng H. Marians K.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 4675-4682Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), (ii) there is no free DnaB present in the reaction mixture to associate with the single-stranded tail, and (iii) primase-catalyzed priming on single-stranded DNA is completely inhibited by the presence of SSB, in both the presence and the absence of DnaB (26Arai K. Kornberg A. Proc. Nat'l. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1979; 76: 4308-4312Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar, 27Arai K. Kornberg A. J. Biol. Chem. 1981; 256: 5267-5272Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 28Swart J.R. Griep M.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 12970-12976Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In addition, to ensure that we had not created conditions where unused TFII DNA templates were somehow supporting new initiation events, we used Southern blotting to determine the strand sense of the new population of DNA (Fig. 4). The probe for leading strand DNA detected the large DNA population that barely entered the gel but did not detect the population of DNA that increased in size (Fig. 4 A). On the other hand, the new primase-dependent population of DNA that increased in size was detected by the probe for lagging strand DNA (Fig. 4 B). The band observed at 6.5 kb in Fig. 4 B represents (−)-strand DNA of the TFII template. The data presented in Figs. 3 and 4 argue that the association of primase with the replication fork can trigger cycling of the lagging strand polymerase. Under the conditions of the experiment presented in Fig. 3 A, no long Okazaki fragment is observed, even though there is template available, with isolated replisomes where the only available DNA polymerase is that which is present at the replication fork. This indicates that the lagging strand polymerase cycles immediately to the 3′-end of the second primer synthesized by primase, probably as soon as it becomes available, and does not continue synthesis of the first Okazaki fragment to the end of the template. This is supported by the fact that we can, in fact, observe extension of the first Okazaki fragment beyond typical size if additional, free Pol III HE is added to the reaction mixture (Fig. 3 B). An alternative explanation of the data was considered. It was possible that the first primer synthesized when primase was added to the reaction might not be used by the lagging strand polymerase yet still remain bound to the template. Under these circumstances, if the lagging strand polymerase then bound to the second primer made, it might synthesize DNA until it encountered the first primer and then cycle as a result of a collision-directed trigger. To address this issue, we tested the following prediction. If cycling was being induced by a collision with the first, unused primer, then when free HE was a"

In addition to the physiological substrate, nitrogenase catalyzes reduction of a variety of other multiply bonded substrates, such as acetylene, nitrous oxide, and azide. Although carbon monoxide (CO) is not reduced by nitrogenase, it is a potent inhibitor of all nitrogenase catalyzed substrate reductions except proton reduction. Here, we present kinetic parameters for an altered Azotobacter vinelandii MoFe protein for which the αGly69residue was substituted by serine (Christiansen, J., Cash, V. L., Seefeldt, L.

However, for the αSer69 MoFe protein both CO and acetylene have become competitive inhibitors of dinitrogen reduction. CO is also converted from a noncompetitive inhibitor to a competitive inhibitor of acetylene, nitrous oxide, and azide reduction. These results are interpreted in terms of a two-site model.

Site 1 and site 2 are proposed to be located in close proximity within a specific 4Fe-4S face of FeMo cofactor. The site of substrate binding and reduction within the Mo-dependent nitrogenase is provided by a complex metallocluster located within the α-subunit of the MoFe protein (1Burgess B.K. Chem. Rev. 1990; 90: 1377-1406Crossref Scopus (330) Google Scholar,2Howard J.B. Rees D.C. Chem. Rev. 1996; 96: 2965-2982Crossref PubMed Scopus (882) Google Scholar). This metallocluster, called FeMo cofactor, contains a metal-sulfur core constructed from 4Fe-3S and 3Fe-3S-Mo subfragments that are geometrically analogous to pieces derived from cuboidal clusters (3Kim J. Rees D.C. Science. 1992; 257: 1677-1682Crossref PubMed Scopus (740) Google Scholar) (Fig. 1). An organic constituent, homocitrate, is coordinated to the Mo atom through its 2-hydroxy and 2-carboxyl groups. Opposite ends of the FeMo cofactor are covalently attached to the MoFe protein α-subunit through αCys275, coordinated to an Fe atom at one end of the molecule, and αHis442, which is coordinated to the antipodal Mo atom. The FeMo cofactor also interacts with the MoFe protein through a number of direct and water-bridged hydrogen bonds. Where and how dinitrogen interacts with the metal-sulfur surface of FeMo cofactor during catalysis and the specific contribution of the polypeptide to that process has been the subject of much speculation and debate (4Pickett C.J.

Triplett E.W. Prokaryotic Nitrogen Fixation. Horizon Scientific Press, Wymondham, UK2000: 101-112Google Scholar), but there is little substantive information available concerning these issues. In addition to an ability to reduce its natural substrate, nitrogenase also catalyzes reduction of a variety of other multiply bonded substrates, including acetylene, azide, and nitrous oxide (7Burris R.H.

In the absence of dinitrogen, or other substrates, nitrogenase catalyzes the reduction of protons to yield hydrogen gas. Carbon monoxide (CO) is not a nitrogenase substrate but is a powerful inhibitor of all nitrogenase catalyzed substrate reductions except proton reduction. In the presence of CO, electron flux through nitrogenase is diverted to proton reduction whether or not any other substrate is available. The kinetic features of nitrogenase as well as the nature of the interaction among the various nitrogenase substrates and inhibitors are complex. This complexity has been attributed to multiple substrate and inhibitor binding sites within the enzyme (7Burris R.H. Hardy R.W.F. Bottemely F. Burns R.C. A Treatise on Dinitrogen Fixation, Sections I and II: Inorganic and Physical Chemistry and Biochemistry. John Wiley and Sons, Inc., New York1979: 569-604Google Scholar, 9Burgess B.K. Spiro T.G. Metal Ions in Biology: Molybdenum Enzymes. John Wiley and Sons, New York1985: 161-220Google Scholar) and the fact that the enzyme accesses a range of redox states during turnover (10Thorneley R.N.F. Lowe D.J. Spiro T.G. Molybdenum Enzymes. Wiley, New York1985: 221-284Google Scholar). These features have hampered the use of inhibitors and alternative substrates to identify and characterize the physiologically relevant active site. One approach toward solving this problem is to isolate an altered form of nitrogenase for which the physiologically irrelevant inhibitor and substrate binding site(s) have been eliminated without causing a significant alteration in the ability of the enzyme to reduce dinitrogen. Toward this end we recently described a genetic selection for the isolation of a MoFe protein that is severely altered in its ability to reduce the alternative substrate acetylene but is only modestly affected in its ability to reduce dinitrogen (11Christiansen J. Cash V.L. Seefeldt L.C. Dean D.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 11459-11464Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). Here we report on the ability of this altered MoFe protein, which has the αGly69 residue substituted by serine, to reduce the alternative substrates azide and nitrous oxide, as well as on the susceptibility of the reduction of these and other substrates to inhibition by CO. MoFe proteins were isolated from A. vinelandii strains designated DJ995 (αGly69, wild type) (12Christiansen J. Goodwin P.J. Lanzilotta W.N. Seefeldt L.C. Dean D.R. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 12611-12623Crossref PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar) or DJ1262 (αSer69) (11Christiansen J. Cash V.L. Seefeldt L.C. Dean D.R. J. Biol.

Methods for strain construction, large scale growth, protein purification, and handling were reported previously (11Christiansen J. Cash V.L. Seefeldt L.C. Dean D.R. J. Biol.

Jacobs D.B. Stiefel E.I. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1980; 614: 196-209Crossref PubMed Scopus (233) Google Scholar). Assays consisted of a 1-ml final volume containing the nitrogenase component proteins, 25 mm HEPES buffer, pH 7.4, Na2S2O4 and a MgATP regenerating system (14Kim C.-H. Newton W.E. Dean D.R. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 2798-2808Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar). Assay samples that had gaseous substrates added were brought to atmospheric pressure prior to the start of the assay. The reaction, performed at 30 °C, was initiated by the addition of Fe protein and terminated by addition of 0.25 ml of 0.4 mEDTA, pH 7.5. In solution, azide is present as both N3− and HN3, and “azide” will therefore refer to these two species collectively. Azide was prepared from a 0.1 m stock solution of NaN3 prepared in 25 mm HEPES buffer, pH 7.4. Gaseous dinitrogen, nitrous oxide, and CO were taken directly from commercially prepared high purity cylinders, and acetylene was prepared fresh by the reaction of calcium carbide with water. For the measurement of H2, a Shimadzu GC-14 gas chromatograph equipped with a molecular sieve 5A column and a thermal conductivity detector was used. To measure ethylene and methane, a Hewlett-Packard 5890A gas chromatograph equipped with an Al2O3 capillary column and flame ionization detector was used. NH3 was quantified with the colorimetric indophenol method (15Dilworth M.J. Eldridge M.E. Eady R.R. Anal. Biochem. 1992; 207: 6-10Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar, 16Ennor A.H. Methods Enzymol. 1957; 3: 850-856Crossref Scopus (45) Google Scholar), and hydrazine (for detecting azide reduction) was measured using the reaction withp-dimethylaminobenzaldeyhde (17Dilworth M.J. Thorneley R.N.F. Biochem. J. 1981; 193: 971-983Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). Lineweaver-Burk plots were used to initially determine the pattern of inhibition. All data used was the average of at least four independent determinations. Data for the substrate alone and with at least two inhibitor concentrations were then plotted as velocity versus substrate concentration and fit to the following hyperbolic equation (18Segel I.H. Biochemical Calculations. John Wiley & Sons, New York1976Google Scholar), v=Vmax′·[S]/Km′+[S]where v is the measured enzyme velocity, [S] is the substrate concentration, and the variable parameters Vmax′ and Km′ denote the apparent maximum velocity and Michaelis constant (when the inhibitor concentration is zero, Vmax′ =V max and Km′ =K m). Values from the resulting linear fits could then be used to generate linear replots of the data from which values for K is (replotted asK m/V max versusinhibitor concentration for both competitive and noncompetitive inhibition) and K ii (replotted as 1/V max versus inhibitor concentration for noncompetitive inhibition) could be derived. The Km values determined for dinitrogen and the alternative substrates acetylene, azide, and nitrous oxide are shown in Table I for both the wild type (αGly69) and αSer69 MoFe proteins. The results show that the dinitrogen, N2O, and azideKm values for both MoFe proteins are similar. However, the small increase in the dinitrogen Km for the αSer69 MoFe protein and relatively larger increase in Km for N2O and azide are reproducible. In contrast to these substrates, there is a marked 20-fold increase in the Km for acetylene reduction catalyzed by the αSer69 MoFe protein when compared with the wild type MoFe protein. Although not a substrate, CO is reported to be a powerful inhibitor of all nitrogenase substrate reduction activities except for proton reduction (9Burgess B.K. Spiro T.G. Metal Ions in Biology: Molybdenum Enzymes. John Wiley and Sons, New York1985: 161-220Google Scholar). We are able to reproduce this effect for CO inhibition of dinitrogen, acetylene, azide, and nitrous oxide reduction. Table I shows theK is and K ii values we obtain for the wild type enzyme. Representative data used to obtain these values are shown in Lineweaver-Burk plots presented in Fig.2. In the case of the αSer69 MoFe protein, CO is converted from a noncompetitive to a competitive inhibitor of all four substrate reductions (Table I and Fig. 2). Comparison of theK is values with respect to CO obtained for the wild type MoFe protein and the αSer69 MoFe protein shows that they are all quite similar. This indicates that this aspect of the interaction of CO with the MoFe protein is unchanged between the wild type and αSer69 MoFe proteins.Table ICO Inhibition of wild type (αGly 69) and αSer 69 MoFe protein activitiesMoFe proteinSubstrateK mCO inhibitionK is 1-aAll values reported have <5% error.K ii 1-aAll values reported have <5% error.Wild typeN20.08 ± 0.02 atmNoncompetitive2 × 104 atm3 × 10−4 atmαSer69N20.09 ± 0.03 atmCompetitive2 × 10−4 atmWild typeC2H20.0075 ± 0.0008 atmNoncompetitive2 × 10−4 atm1 × 10−3 atmαSer69C2H20.14 ± 0.01 atmCompetitive3 × 10−4 atmWild typeAzide5 ± 1 mmNoncompetitive2 × 10−4 atm4 × 10−4 atmαSer69Azide13 ± 2 mmCompetitive7 × 10−5 atmWild typeN2O0.048 ± 0.003 atmNoncompetitive2 × 10−4 atm2 × 10−3 atmαSer69N2O0.08 ± 0.03 atmCompetitive9 × 10−5 atm1-a All values reported have <5% error. Open table in a new tab For the wild type MoFe protein, acetylene is a noncompetitive inhibitor of dinitrogen, nitrous oxide, and azide reduction (7Burris R.H. Hardy R.W.F. Bottemely F. Burns R.C. A Treatise on Dinitrogen Fixation, Sections I and II: Inorganic and Physical Chemistry and Biochemistry. John Wiley and Sons, Inc., New York1979: 569-604Google Scholar, 19Liang J. Burris R.H. Biochemistry. 1988; 27: 6726-6732Crossref Scopus (14) Google Scholar). We previously reported that substitution of the αGly69residue by serine results in an altered MoFe protein for which acetylene is now a competitive inhibitor of dinitrogen reduction (11Christiansen J. Cash V.L. Seefeldt L.C. Dean D.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 11459-11464Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). The αSer69 substitution also results in a dramatic increase in K m for acetylene reduction. On the basis of these results we concluded that the normal enzyme has two distinct acetylene binding sites. One of these (Site 1) has a high affinity for acetylene binding (K m ∼0.007 atm) and is functionally separate from the site to which dinitrogen and other mutually competitive substrates, for example azide (17Dilworth M.J. Thorneley R.N.F. Biochem. J. 1981; 193: 971-983Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar) and nitrous oxide (19Liang J. Burris R.H. Biochemistry. 1988; 27: 6726-6732Crossref Scopus (14) Google Scholar), bind. The other site (Site 2) has a much lower affinity for acetylene binding (K m ∼0.14 atm) and is functionally equivalent to the site where dinitrogen binds. Thus, the ability of acetylene to access Site 1 appears to have been eliminated or severely altered as a result of the αSer69substitution, resulting in the sole manifestation of Site 2. Similar to the situation of acetylene inhibition of the reduction of other substrates catalyzed by the αSer69 MoFe protein, the altered MoFe protein exhibits a competitive rather than noncompetitive pattern of inhibition by CO for the reduction of all triply bonded substrates examined, including acetylene. Our interpretation of these results is that, like acetylene, there are two different CO binding sites that affect substrate reduction when occupied by CO. One of these corresponds to the same site or an overlapping site as the high affinity acetylene binding site (Site 1) and the other corresponds to the low affinity acetylene binding site (Site 2), which is also the same site to which dinitrogen, azide, and nitrous oxide bind. It should be noted that, because the MoFe protein accesses a manifold of different redox states during turnover, it is possible that Site 1 and Site 2 might not necessarily differ in their physical locations, but could represent different redox states of the enzyme. There is also no direct kinetic evidence to indicate that both CO and acetylene bind to Site 1. However, this assignment is consistent with the observation that a single amino acid substitution within the MoFe protein is able to convert both CO and acetylene from noncompetitive to competitive inhibitors of the reduction of other triply bonded substrates. Previous EPR and electron nuclear double resonance spectroscopic studies have been interpreted to indicate that CO binds to Fe in the FeMo cofactor (20Lee H.-I. Cameron L.M. Hales B.J. Hoffman B.M. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1997; 119: 10121-10126Crossref Scopus (111) Google Scholar, 21Lee H.-I. Hales B.J. Hoffman B.M. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1997; 119: 11395-11400Crossref Scopus (109) Google Scholar). Thus, because CO becomes a competitive inhibitor of substrates for the αSer69 MoFe protein, it can be inferred that at least the initial substrate binding event is likely to occur at a site involving Fe in the FeMo cofactor. However, this possibility must be considered from the perspective that no direct kinetic relationship has yet been established between individual EPR species generated during nitrogenase turnover in the presence of CO and effects on substrate reduction. In our original analysis of the αSer69 MoFe protein we proposed that both the high affinity and low affinity acetylene binding sites are functionally distinct but located within the same 4Fe-4S face of the FeMo cofactor that is approached by the αVal70 residue (11Christiansen J. Cash V.L. Seefeldt L.C. Dean D.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 11459-11464Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). Inspection of the MoFe protein structure reveals that both the αGly69 and αVal70 residues are located on a short helix that skirts one face of FeMo cofactor (22Kim J. Rees D.C. Nature. 1992; 360: 553-560Crossref PubMed Scopus (572) Google Scholar) (Fig. 1). In addition to the approach of the αVal70 side chain toward one side of a 4Fe-4S face of the FeMo cofactor, the carbonyl groups of both αGly69 and αVal70 are within hydrogen bonding distance of a guanidino group provided by the side chain of αArg96, which also approaches the same 4Fe-4S face. Thus, it can be reasonably considered that the αSer69substitution could affect the accessibility of nitrogenase substrates and inhibitors to this 4Fe-4S face as a result of movement of either the αVal70 side chain or the main chain that includes αGly69 and αVal70, which is interacting with αArg96. In either case, if all catalytically relevant substrate and inhibitor binding sites are located on the same face, alteration of this environment is expected to have some effect on binding events at both sites. Because the original selection of the mutant that harbors the αSer69 substitution demanded a capacity for near normal physiological dinitrogen reduction, a dramatic effect on dinitrogen reduction catalyzed by the isolated enzyme from this strain was not expected and is not observed. In contrast, no such selection pressure was placed on the ability of the altered MoFe protein to reduce azide and the Km for the reduction this substrate is significantly increased by the αSer69 substitution. Azide, nitrous oxide, and dinitrogen are all mutually competitive inhibitors of each other for the wild type MoFe protein and almost certainly bind to the same site. Thus, in addition to the elimination of the catalytically relevant accessibility of acetylene and CO to Site 1 as a result of the αSer69 substitution, there is also an effect on certain binding events that occur at Site 2, further indicating that both sites are in close proximity. In summary, with respect to CO, acetylene, azide, nitrous oxide, and dinitrogen, there are two catalytically relevant substrate and inhibitor binding sites located within the nitrogenase MoFe protein. Site 1 is able to bind either acetylene or CO but apparently does not bind dinitrogen, azide, or nitrous oxide. Site 2 is able to bind CO, acetylene, azide, nitrous oxide, and the physiological substrate, dinitrogen. This two-site model was derived from analysis of the αSer69 MoFe protein for which accessibility to Site 1 is eliminated or severely altered, with respect to effects on substrate reduction, and is consistent with the known kinetic parameters of the wild type enzyme (7Burris R.H.

We also propose that Site 1 and Site 2 are located within the same 4Fe-4S face of FeMo cofactor that is bounded by αVal70, αArg96, and αHis195(Fig. 1). The important conclusion that can be made from this work is that when the nonphysiologically relevant substrate and inhibitor site is functionally removed, nitrogenase behaves as a classic single site enzyme where substrate and inhibitor interactions are reciprocal."
https://openalex.org/W2055985537,"The mechanism of interaction betweenS-nitrosoglutathione (GSNO) and hemoglobin is a crucial component of hypotheses concerning the role played byS-nitrosohemoglobin in vivo. We previously demonstrated (Patel, R. P., Hogg, N., Spencer, N. Y., Kalyanaraman, B., Matalon, S., and Darley-Usmar, V. M. (1999)J. Biol. Chem. 274, 15487–15492) that transnitrosation between oxygenated hemoglobin and GSNO is a slow, reversible process, and that the reaction between GSNO and deoxygenated hemoglobin (deoxyHb) did not conform to second order reversible kinetics. In this study we have reinvestigated this reaction and show that GSNO reacts with deoxyHb to form glutathione, nitric oxide, and ferric hemoglobin. Nitric oxide formed from this reaction is immediately autocaptured to form nitrosylated hemoglobin. GSNO reduction by deoxyHb is essentially irreversible. The kinetics of this reaction depended upon the conformation of the protein, with more rapid kinetics occurring in the high oxygen affinity state (i.e.modification of the Cysβ-93) than in the low oxygen affinity state (i.e. treatment with inositol hexaphosphate). A more rapid reaction occurred when deoxymyoglobin was used, further supporting the observation that the kinetics of reduction are directly proportional to oxygen affinity. This observation provides a mechanism for how deoxygenation of hemoglobin/myoglobin could facilitate nitric oxide release from S-nitrosothiols and represents a potential physiological mechanism of S-nitrosothiol metabolism. The mechanism of interaction betweenS-nitrosoglutathione (GSNO) and hemoglobin is a crucial component of hypotheses concerning the role played byS-nitrosohemoglobin in vivo.

Bonaventura C. Bonaventura J. Stamler J.S. Nature. 1996; 380: 221-226Crossref PubMed Scopus (1470) Google Scholar), and that the combination ofS-nitrosohemoglobin and glutathione (GSH) will relax vessels in an oxygen sensitive manner (2Stamler J.S. Jia L. Eu J.P. McMahon T.J. Demchenko I.T. Bonaventura J. Gernert K. Piantadosi C.A. Science. 1997; 276: 2034-2037Crossref PubMed Scopus (954) Google Scholar). HbSNO is a post-translationally modified form of hemoglobin that contains a nitrosated cysteinyl residue at the β-93 position. The mechanism for the formation of HbSNO in vivo remains unknown, and the functional consequences of this modification are the subject of intense debate (1Jia L. Bonaventura C. Bonaventura J. Stamler J.S. Nature. 1996; 380: 221-226Crossref PubMed Scopus (1470) Google Scholar, 2Stamler J.S. Jia L. Eu J.P. McMahon T.J. Demchenko I.T. Bonaventura J. Gernert K. Piantadosi C.A.

Chem. 1999; 274: 28983-28990Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar). It has been suggested that S-nitrosation of Hb represents an oxygen-sensitive mechanism to control vascular tone (1Jia L. Bonaventura C. Bonaventura J. Stamler J.S. Nature. 1996; 380: 221-226Crossref PubMed Scopus (1470) Google Scholar). The crux of this hypothesis is that transnitrosation, i.e.the chemical transfer of the nitroso group, between Hb and GSH is an oxygen-sensitive reaction in which deoxygenation of Hb allows the eventual formation of GSNO, which may then act as a vasodilator. The mechanism by which intra-erythrocyte GSNO acts as a vasodilator is as yet unknown. In a new twist to this hypothesis it has recently been suggested that rapid transnitrosation to form GSNO would be fatal, due to a massive vasodilatory response upon deoxygenation of Hb (5McMahon T.J. Stone A.E. Bonaventura J. Singel D.J. Stamler J.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 16738-16745Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar). In order to avoid such an outcome the majority of the NO has been proposed to be autocaptured at the deoxygenated heme, to give nitrosyl hemoglobin (HbNO), in which nitric oxide is bound to the iron of ferrous hemoglobin. It has been additionally suggested that the transfer of “NO” from thiol to heme is reversible (5McMahon T.J. Stone A.E. Bonaventura J. Singel D.J. Stamler J.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 16738-16745Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar). In order to critically examine this hypothesis, we have undertaken a kinetic and mechanistic examination of the interaction ofS-nitrosoglutathione with Hb. We previously demonstrated that S-nitrosation of Hb increases its oxygen affinity (3Patel R.P. Hogg N. Spencer N.Y. Kalyanaraman B. Matalon S. Darley-Usmar V.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 15487-15492Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar). Consequently the S-nitrosated Hb will only be deoxygenated after the majority of the unmodified Hb has released its oxygen. This suggests that oxygen-dependent transnitrosation will only occur in situations where the erythrocyte is substantially deoxygenated. In addition, we examined the kinetics of the reaction between GSNO and Hb. The reaction between GSNO and oxygenated hemoglobin (oxyHb) conforms well to second order reversible kinetics. The reaction is slow (∼0.1 m−1s−1) in both directions and has an equilibrium constant of 1.3 (3Patel R.P. Hogg N. Spencer N.Y. Kalyanaraman B. Matalon S. Darley-Usmar V.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 15487-15492Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar). We also demonstrated that the reaction between GSNO and deoxygenated hemoglobin (deoxyHb) is also slow but does not conform to second order reversible kinetics. Consequently a value for the equilibrium constant for transnitrosation between GSNO and deoxyHb cannot be calculated, and should not be inferred from our data as was done recently by McMahon et al. (5McMahon T.J. Stone A.E. Bonaventura J. Singel D.J. Stamler J.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 16738-16745Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar). In this study we have re-examined the reaction between GSNO and deoxyHb and conclude that GSNO can be directly reduced by deoxyHb to form GSH, metHb, and nitric oxide. The nitric oxide may then bind to the free heme of hemoglobin to form HbNO. This reaction is essentially irreversible. GSH, sodium nitrite, N-ethylmaleimide (NEM), bovine serum albumin, phytic acid (inositol hexaphosphate, IP6), and myoglobin (Mb) from horse heart were obtained from Sigma. Diethylenetriaminepentaacetic acid (DTPA) was obtained from Fluka. Human hemoglobin was prepared from freshly drawn blood as previously described (6Antonini E. Brunori M. Hemoglobin and Myoglobin in Their Reactions with Ligands. North Holland Publishing Co., Amsterdam1971Google Scholar). GSNO was synthesized from the reaction between GSH and acidified sodium nitrite as previously described (7Field, L., Dilts, R. V., Ravichandran, R., Lanhert, P. G., and Carnahan, P. G. (1978) J. Chem. Soc. Chem. Commun. 249–250.Google Scholar, 8Hart T.W. Tetrahedron Lett. 1985; 26: 2013-2026Crossref Scopus (384) Google Scholar). ApoHb and metHb were prepared from hemoglobin as previously described (6Antonini E. Brunori M. Hemoglobin and Myoglobin in Their Reactions with Ligands. North Holland Publishing Co., Amsterdam1971Google Scholar). Hemoglobin was deoxygenated, and the various solutions used in the experiments were rendered anaerobic, by alternating vacuum and argon gas. The solution was first placed in a gas-tight glass vial which was sealed with a rubber stopper. Then argon gas and vacuum were alternately applied to the inside of the vial through a needle for at least 10 min, with five or more cycles of argon and vacuum. No room air was allowed to enter the vial at any time during this treatment. Once fully deoxygenated, samples were transferred to an anaerobic glove box (Coy Laboratory Products, Inc.) to allow experiments to be carried out under anaerobic conditions. All experiments were performed at 24 °C in subdued light in the presence of DTPA. Certricon Centrifugal Filter Devices (Millipore) were used to separate low-molecular weight compounds from hemoglobin. In all ultrafiltration experiments where deoxyHb was involved, the filter devices were sealed inside gas-tight centrifuge tubes in order to avoid introduction of oxygen during centrifugation. Centrifugation was carried out at 3800 ×g for 5 min. Eluates were analyzed for GSH and GSNO as described below. In some experiments, hemoglobin thiols were blocked by preincubation with excess NEM. In order to measure GSH, it was necessary to remove excess NEM by passing down a Sephadex G-25 column. Fractions were collected, and only those fractions not containing NEM (as determined by UV-visible spectrophotometry) were combined and concentrated using filter devices. Thiol measurements indicated that NEM treatment decreased hemoglobin thiol content from 84% to 0%. S-Nitrosothiols and glutathione (9Hogg N. Singh R.J. Kalyanaraman B. FEBS Lett. 1996; 382: 223-228Crossref PubMed Scopus (249) Google Scholar, 10Tsikas D. Sandmann J. Holzberg D. Pantazis P. Raida M. Frolich J.C. Anal. Biochem. 1999; 273: 32-40Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar) were analyzed and quantified by HPLC as previously described. Following the manufacturer's standard protocols, a Sievers 280 Nitric Oxide Analyzer was used to detect nitrate and nitrite. To detect S-nitrosothiols, cupric sulfate (1 mm) was included in the standard nitrite-detecting solution (7.1 mg/ml KI, 76% glacial acetic acid) in the purge vessel. EPR spectra were obtained using an X-band spectrometer with the following conditions: modulation amplitude: 2.5 G, time constant: 0.128 s, scan time: 1 min, frequency: 9.17 GHz, microwave power: 10 mW, center field: 3260 G, scan width: 500 G, sample temperature: 77 K, number of signal averages: 4. EPR spectra of nitrosylHb were quantified by double integration and comparison with standard spectra of nitrosylHb collected under identical conditions. DeoxyHb (833 μm, all concentrations are expressed in terms of heme) was incubated with GSNO (approximately 20 μm) in phosphate buffer containing DTPA, in an anaerobic glove box, in subdued light. Samples were removed at various time points during an hour time course, and then subjected to ultrafiltration under anaerobic conditions. A slow decrease in the concentration of GSNO in the eluates was observed by chemiluminescence (Fig. 1). The percent decrease in [GSNO] was variable between experiments, as shown by the large error bars in Fig. 1. GSNO disappearance was associated with the formation of a small amount of GSH. Treatment of the eluates with dithiothreitol caused reduction of all GSNO and any GSSG which may have been present, and accounted for the discrepancy between the large amount of GSNO lost and the somewhat smaller amount of GSH formed. Controls using either phosphate buffer (containing DTPA) or double-distilled water, instead of hemoglobin, did not promote any loss of GSNO over the entire time course (data not shown).Figure 1The reaction between GSNO and deoxyhemoglobin. GSNO (20 μm) was incubated with deoxyhemoglobin (833 μm total heme) under strictly anaerobic conditions in a nitrogen glove box. At the indicated time points samples were removed and filtered using Centricon filtration devices under anaerobic conditions. The filtrate was then assayed for GSH (▪), GSNO (▴), and total glutathione (●). Data points represent mean ± S.E. (n = 3).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Because deoxyHb-dependent loss of GSNO might be attributed to a transnitrosation reaction to the hemoglobin Cys-β93, a similar experiment to that shown in Fig. 1 was performed using NEM-pretreated hemoglobin. NEM pretreatment completely modified all 5,5′-dithio-bis(2-nitrobenzoic acid) (DTNB)-detectable thiol groups. When NEM-pretreated deoxyHb (833 μm) was incubated with GSNO (27 μm), again the decomposition of GSNO was observed (Fig. 2). As with untreated hemoglobin, a concomitant formation of GSH was observed. This indicates that, at least in this case, transnitrosation cannot be responsible for the formation of GSH from GSNO. When fully oxygenated hemoglobin with excess NEM was used, there was no loss of GSNO over the same length of time (data not shown). In addition to modifying the thiol residues of hemoglobin, NEM modification of the β93 cysteinyl residue also stabilizes hemoglobin in the so-called “R”-state or high oxygen-affinity state (11Riggs A. J. Biol. Chem. 1961; 236: 1948-1954Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The rates of GSNO decay and GSH formation were slightly faster when NEM-treated hemoglobin was used, suggesting that the kinetics of this reaction are related to the conformation of the hemoglobin tetramer. In order to test this hypothesis we examined the kinetics of GSNO decay and GSH formation in the presence of IP6, which stabilizes hemoglobin in the low oxygen-affinity “T” conformation. As shown in Fig. 3, the presence of IP6resulted in both a slower loss of GSNO and a slower formation of GSH when compared with NEM Hb (Fig. 2). These data indicate that the rate of reaction of GSNO with hemoglobin depends on the conformation of the hemoglobin and therefore on the degree of oxygen affinity. Nitrite/nitrate analysis by chemiluminescence indicated that the nitroso group that had been displaced from GSNO did not appear in the ultrafiltrate as an oxide of nitrogen (data not shown). However, electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) analysis revealed the concomitant formation of HbNO. As shown in Fig.4 A, incubation of 0.5 mm GSNO with 0.5 mm hemoglobin, with excess NEM present, resulted in the formation of an EPR spectrum indicative of HbNO showing a small contribution from 5-coordinate heme and a large contribution from 6-coordinate heme (12Hille R. Olson J.S. Palmer G. J. Biol. Chem. 1979; 254: 12110-12120Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The magnitude of the EPR signal increased as a function of time. In the presence of IP6, but not NEM, only the 5-coordinate signal was observed and the signal evolution was slowed (Fig. 4 B). The 5-coordinate heme signal has a clear nitrogen hyperfine (aN= 16.75 G). This signal has previously been attributed to nitric oxide bound to the ferrous iron of the α-subunit heme, causing a displacement of the proximal histidine ligand (12Hille R. Olson J.S. Palmer G. J. Biol. Chem. 1979; 254: 12110-12120Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 13Traylor T.G. Sharma V.S. Biochemistry. 1992; 31: 2847-2849Crossref PubMed Scopus (349) Google Scholar). These data indicate that the reaction between GSNO and hemoglobin yields both GSH and nitric oxide, the latter of which rapidly binds to unliganded ferrous heme. To convert GSNO to GSH and nitric oxide it is necessary to reduce theS-nitrosothiol by one electron. It seemed likely that this electron could come from the ferrous heme iron, thereby oxidizing it to ferric iron. Consequently, UV-vis spectrophotometry was used to detect the formation of the ferric form of hemoglobin (metHb) during the reaction between GSNO and deoxyHb under anaerobic conditions, in the presence of either NEM or IP6. The reaction was effectively stopped at various time points by 1:10 dilution with aerobic 50 mm phosphate buffer containing DTPA, and the samples were immediately scanned in the spectrophotometer. The absorbance at 630 nm was observed to increase over time faster with NEM present than with IP6. Quantitative comparison of the rate of metHb formation to that of HbNO formation (from Fig. 4) indicated that the rates of formation of metHb and HbNO follow very similar time courses, suggesting that their formation occurs as a result of the same kinetic process in an almost 1:1 stoichiometry (Fig.5). It is unlikely that the metHb measured in these experiments is formed from the reaction between oxygen and HbNO, because the reaction between oxygen and HbNO to form metHb is very slow. No metHb was formed over the same time in the absence of GSNO (data not shown) indicating that no significant autoxidation occurs under the experimental conditions employed in these studies. To further investigate interactions of hemoglobin and GSNO, another experiment was performed in which fully oxygenated hemoglobin (500 μm) was incubated with GSNO (500 μm) for 18 h in the dark in the presence of DTPA (Fig.6 A, inset). At various time points during this incubation, aliquots were removed and separated by ultrafiltration. A slow disappearance of GSNO from the eluates was observed over this time. This was attributed to either transnitrosation or S-thiolation (1Jia L. Bonaventura C. Bonaventura J. Stamler J.S. Nature. 1996; 380: 221-226Crossref PubMed Scopus (1470) Google Scholar, 4Wolzt M. MacAllister R.J. Davis D. Feelisch M. Moncada S. Vallance P. Hobbs A.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 28983-28990Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar). No HbNO was observed during this time (Fig. 6 A, inset). After 18 h, the solution was thoroughly deoxygenated. Over the next 3 h, several more aliquots were removed and separated. Both the disappearance of GSNO and the formation of HbNO were followed. As shown in Fig. 6 A, the loss of GSNO was paralleled by the formation of HbNO, suggesting that all the HbNO observed occurs as a result of the decay of GSNO in solution. After 3 h, the solution was re-exposed to oxygen (Fig. 6 A, arrow), and over the next 9.5 h, several aliquots were removed and either separated by ultrafiltration or examined by EPR. During this time, the GSNO level in the eluates continued to decrease. The HbNO signal did not change during the first hour in the presence of oxygen, but decreased slowly over the total 9.5 h. These observations indicate that the formation of nitrosyl-Hb from GSNO is irreversible and suggest that transnitrosation from deoxyHbSNO to GSH is much slower than the reaction between GSNO and deoxyHb. The EPR spectrum of HbNO taken from the experiment shown in Fig.6 A after incubation for 180 min in an anaerobic environment consisted of mainly 6-coordinate heme with a small contribution from 5-coordinate heme (Fig. 6 B, spectrum A). In a similar experiment performed without the 18-h aerobic preincubation, the EPR spectrum exhibited a much greater contribution from 5-coordinate heme (Fig. 6 B, spectrum C). The large contribution of 6-coordinate heme in Fig. 6 B, spectrum A, is likely due to the fact that the hemoglobin thiol has been extensively modified by either S-nitrosation or S-thiolation (cf. NEM-treated hemoglobin in Fig. 4 A). This observation indicates that the Cys-β93 thiol has been modified during the 18 h in room air, either by transnitrosation orS-thiolation, and that deoxygenation did not appreciably reverse the thiol modification, even over 3 h. Upon reintroduction of oxygen to the sample shown in Fig. 6 B, spectrum A, the hyperfine structure was lost but there was no change in nitrosyl Hb concentration calculated from the double integrated area of the spectra. In order to examine if GSNO could also react with myoglobin, a heme protein with a very high oxygen affinity, GSNO was incubated with myoglobin, and nitrosyl myoglobin (MbNO) formation was examined by EPR. The formation of both metMb (not shown) and MbNO was observed. The formation of MbNO (Fig. 7) occurred more rapidly than did the formation of NEM-treated HbNO (Fig.4 A), with 114 μm MbNO formed after only 45 min. As myoglobin does not contain an accessible cysteine residue, transnitrosation could not be responsible for this observation. This again suggests that the kinetics of reaction between GSNO and heme groups are related to oxygen accessibility. Previously we demonstrated that, using trichloroacetic acid precipitation, an accurate determination of the kinetics of transnitrosation between oxyHb and GSNO could be obtained (3Patel R.P. Hogg N. Spencer N.Y. Kalyanaraman B. Matalon S. Darley-Usmar V.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 15487-15492Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar). However, such a determination was impossible with deoxyHb due to the fact that some of the GSNO was consumed immediately after initiation of the reaction. As shown in Fig. 8, a portion of the GSNO is lost immediately upon the treatment of deoxyHb, but not oxyHb, with GSNO, followed by trichloroacetic acid precipitation. The amount lost is proportional to the Hb concentration and is not affected by the presence of NEM. It originally appeared as though GSNO was binding to the heme of Hb and was co-precipitating with the protein as this effect was not observed with apoHb, metHb, or bovine serum albumin (data not shown). We now know that the loss of GSNO was due to the direct reaction between heme and GSNO detailed in this study. These results indicate that when trichloroacetic acid precipitation denatures hemoglobin, the heme pocket is completely opened, allowing rapid reduction of GSNO. This is a potential problem for the measurement of GSNO in the presence of hemoglobin under anaerobic conditions using trichloroacetic acid precipitation. In this study, we have observed a previously unknown reaction between S-nitrosoglutathione and deoxyhemoglobin. When GSNO is incubated with deoxyhemoglobin, GSH is formed from the GSNO. There are at least two possible reactions that could describe the mechanism of formation of GSH from GSNO. The first, transnitrosation, involves transfer of the nitroso group from GSNO to the Cys-β93 residues of hemoglobin, as shown in Equation 1. The second possibility is reduction of GSNO by one electron in a reaction that does not involve the thiol of Cys-β93, as shown in Equation 2.GSNO+HbSH⇌HbSNO+GSHEquation 1 GSNO+e−→GSH+·NOEquation 2 To distinguish between these two possibilities, NEM was used to block all the Cys-β93 thiols in order to prevent any transnitrosation reactions. If transnitrosation appreciably contributes to the formation of GSH from GSNO, blocking the thiols would slow or stop GSH formation. Surprisingly, the rate of formation of GSH was not inhibited. Therefore, the possibility of transnitrosation was excluded and a reductive mechanism was favored (Equation 2). It has been shown that when NEM binds the Cys-β93 thiol, the conformation of the hemoglobin molecule is changed. Specifically, the hemoglobin is forced into the R (high oxygen affinity) state when these thiols are modified. It seemed possible that the conformation of the globin protein could affect the rate of formation of GSH from GSNO. To test this possibility, we treated hemoglobin with IP6, which stabilizes the low-oxygen-affinity T conformation. When this hemoglobin was incubated with GSNO, the rate of formation of GSH was considerably diminished from that observed in the presence of Hb-NEM (cf. Figs. 2 and 3). These data suggest that GSNO interacts more readily with the specific conformation of Hb in which the heme is deoxygenated, yet the globin protein is in the high oxygen affinity R-state. Since GSNO was converted to GSH without a transnitrosation reaction to form HbSNO, it became necessary to determine the fate of the nitroso group of GSNO. If the nitroso group were converted to nitrite or nitrate, it should have been present in the ultrafiltrates. However, neither nitrite nor nitrate was detectable by chemiluminescence. Therefore, it appeared that the nitroso group had become associated with the protein, but not with the Cys-β93 thiol. This was confirmed by EPR as the formation of HbNO was observed. In agreement with GSH formation, the rate of HbNO formation was enhanced by the presence of NEM and was diminished by the presence of IP6. The observation that HbNO was formed along with GSH indicated that a one-electron reduction of GSNO had occurred (Equation 2) and that released nitric oxide had been rapidly captured by deoxyHb. One possible source of an electron was the ferrous heme iron. If ferrous heme iron were to donate the electron, the result would be stoichiometric metHb formation. To test this possibility, we examined metHb formation by UV-visible spectroscopy. As predicted, metHb was formed when GSNO and deoxyHb were incubated together. Bonaventuraet al. (14Bonaventura C. Ferruzzi G. Tesh S. Stevens R.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 24742-24748Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar) also observed significant metHb formation during the reoxygenation of HbSNO in the presence of glutathione, which they ascribed to nitric oxide formation but which could have arisen from the direct oxidation of heme iron by GSNO. IP6 slowed the rate of formation of metHb, whereas NEM increased it (Fig. 5). The stoichiometry between metHb formation and HbSNO formation was almost 1:1. The overall reaction can be thought of as taking place in two steps. First, heme iron is oxidized by GSNO to form GSH, metHb, and nitric oxide (Equation 3). Second, the nascent nitric oxide reacts with another unliganded heme to form HbNO (Equation 4). The net reaction is shown in Equation 5.HbFe2++GSNO+H+→HbFe3++GSH+·NOEquation 3 HbFe2++·NO→HbFe2+NOEquation 4 2HbFe2++GSNO+H+→HbFe3++HbFe2+NO+GSHEquation 5 Using the present methodology, we cannot distinguish whether the oxidation and nitrosylation reactions occur within one hemoglobin tetramer, or whether the oxidation of one heme allows the formation of nitric oxide which then diffuses through solution to another hemoglobin tetramer to nitrosylate a heme therein. Although this reaction does not involve the Cys-β93 thiols of hemoglobin, the rate of the reaction is affected by the modification of this thiol. When all free Cys-β93s are blocked with NEM, the reaction rate approximately doubles as compared with IP6-treated hemoglobin. We speculate that this is due to the fact that modification of this thiol forces the globin tetramer into the R (high oxygen affinity) state. When IP6 is used to force hemoglobin into the T-state, the reaction rate is diminished. To test whether Equation 5 is reversible, the experiment shown in Fig.6 was carried out. When GSNO was incubated with oxyHb, GSNO slowly decayed but no HbNO was formed. This confirms the fact that Equation 5cannot occur with fully oxygenated hemoglobin. Because NEM was not present to block thiols, the decay of GSNO was attributed to transnitrosation (1Jia L. Bonaventura C. Bonaventura J. Stamler J.S.

Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 28983-28990Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar), or both. Therefore, at the moment that this solution was deoxygenated after 18 h of aerobic incubation, a substantial number of Cys-β93 thiols will have been modified. Thus, these molecules would be stabilized in the R conformation, as we have previously shown (3Patel R.P. Hogg N. Spencer N.Y. Kalyanaraman B. Matalon S. Darley-Usmar V.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 15487-15492Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar). After deoxygenation, HbNO was formed from the reduction of the GSNO remaining in solution. The EPR spectrum of the HbNO indicated a large contribution from 6-coordinate heme, suggesting that a major portion of the HbNO molecules still contained a thiol modification after 3 h in an anaerobic state. Deoxygenation therefore did not appreciably reverse the thiol modifications. Upon re-introduction of oxygen, the concentration of HbNO remained constant for an hour indicating that the formation of HbNO was also not reversible. Our current hypothesis for the interaction of GSNO with hemoglobin is shown in Scheme FS1. Oxygen binding to deoxyHb is a complex cooperative process. For the sake of simplicity we have shown this reaction as a simple reversible binding defined by rate constants k 1 and k −1. Oxygen binding to HbSNO is similarly treated and defined by rate constants k 3 and k −3. Transnitrosation reactions between GSNO and oxyHb or deoxyHb are defined by rate constants k 2 andk −2, or k 4 andk −4, respectively. We have previously measuredk 2 = 0.13 m−1s−1 and k −2 = 0.1m−1 s−1, giving a value for the equilibrium constant K 2 of 1.3 (3Patel R.P. Hogg N. Spencer N.Y. Kalyanaraman B. Matalon S.

Biochem. 1997; 254: 215-220Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar) calculated a value of 0.36 m−1s−1 for k 2 and reported a value of 0.101 for k −4; however, this latter value is likely a measure of k 5 as the method they used followed GSH formation. We also previously demonstrated that HbSNO has a higher oxygen affinity than Hb, which means thatK 1 K 3 < 1 (3Patel R.P. Hogg N. Spencer N.Y. Kalyanaraman B. Matalon S. Darley-Usmar V.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 15487-15492Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar). Due to the principle of microscopic reversibility,K 1 K 2 K 3 K 4= 1 and consequently K 2 K 4> 1. This means that GSNO formation via transnitrosation will be thermodynamically favored under deoxygenated conditions, as has been previously indicated (2Stamler J.S. Jia L. Eu J.P. McMahon T.J.

However, this analysis does not predict or constrain the kinetic parameters for the individual reaction steps, because thermodynamic favorability is not a predictor of reaction rate. In our previous publication (3Patel R.P. Hogg N. Spencer N.Y. Kalyanaraman B. Matalon S. Darley-Usmar V.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 15487-15492Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar) we discussed the difficulties of measuring the rate of transnitrosation in the deoxy state. What at first appeared as binding of GSNO to deoxyHb we now appreciate is a rapid reaction between free heme and GSNO during trichloroacetic acid-dependent precipitation/denaturation. It should be stressed that this reaction is only an issue with unliganded heme and does not occur with oxyHb, validating our kinetic analysis under oxygenated conditions. The fact that this same reaction occurs with intact deoxyHb (reactions k 5 andk 6 in Scheme FS1), albeit at a slower rate, and that GSNO slowly reacts with GSH (k 7 = 8.3 × 10−3m−1 s−1) (9Hogg N. Singh R.J. Kalyanaraman B. FEBS Lett. 1996; 382: 223-228Crossref PubMed Scopus (249) Google Scholar) indicates that the equilibrium “square” shown in Fig. 1 will never achieve equilibrium due to an irreversible loss of GSNO and ferrous Hb. It is possible, from Fig. 5, to approximate the value ofk 5, assuming this reaction conforms to second order kinetics. This calculation gives a value of 0.03m−1 s−1 for the NEM-treated case and 0.01 m−1 s−1 for the IP6-treated case. It must be stressed, however, that a full kinetic analysis of these reactions has not yet been performed and these numbers must be taken as approximations. It can be postulated that the value of k 6 (i.e. the reaction between GSNO and the heme of HbSNO) will be similar to the rate constant for the NEM-treated case, as thiol modifications by both NEM and S-nitrosation have similar effects on oxygen affinity. Our data indicate that the reaction described byk 5 outcompetes that described byk −4, as the formation of metHb closely follows the formation of HbNO (Fig. 5), even in the absence of NEM. These data can be extrapolated to a circulating erythrocyte, but only with caution. The S-nitroso group of oxyHbSNO will be in dynamic exchange with intracellular GSH. Assuming a starting point where all of the nitroso groups are associated either with GSH as GSNO, or else with oxyHb as oxyHbSNO, it would take several hours for this dynamic exchange to reach equilibrium. At equilibrium the concentration of oxyHbSNO and GSNO will be approximately equal (K 1 = 1.3 assuming the concentration of heme thiols and glutathione are the same). The reaction of GSNO with GSH (k 7) indicates that this equilibrium cannot be sustained indefinitely as the S-nitroso group will eventually be converted to nitroxyl. The circulating erythrocyte is, however, rapidly and repeatedly passing through areas of low oxygen tension and so it is highly unlikely that equilibrium will ever be established. In areas of low oxygen tension, GSNO will react with the unliganded heme group to liberate nitric oxide and oxidize the hemoglobin to metHb, which can be re-reduced by the metHb reductase system of the erythrocyte. The nitric oxide can escape from the red cell, bind to deoxyHb, or react with oxyHb. It has recently been demonstrated that when partially oxygenated, binding of nitric oxide to deoxyHb is favored over reaction with oxyHb (16Gow A.J. Luchsinger B.P. Pawloski J.R. Singel D.J. Stamler J.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 9027-9032Crossref PubMed Scopus (378) Google Scholar). Nitric oxide escape appears unlikely as the kinetic barriers that prevent nitric oxide diffusion into red cells will also have to be overcome on the way out (17Liao J.C. Hein T.W. Vaughn M.W. Huang K.-T. Kuo L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 8757-8761Crossref PubMed Scopus (262) Google Scholar). Consequently, the formation of HbNO is the most likely end point. The reaction between GSNO and deoxyMb is faster than the reaction between GSNO and deoxyHb, which also agrees with our hypothesis that the rate of the reaction between heme and GSNO is proportional to oxygen affinity. This reaction may be of great significance as a route of intracellular GSNO metabolism in myoglobin-containing muscle cells. It has previously been demonstrated that nitrosylmyoglobin is formed during perfusion of the intact rat heart with GSNO (18Konorev E.A. Joseph J. Kalyanaraman B. FEBS Lett. 1996; 378: 111-114Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). GSNO is a potent protective agent against reperfusion injury in this model and it is tempting to speculate that myocyte myoglobin may play a role in the release of nitric oxide from GSNO (19Konorev E.A. Joseph J. Tarpey M.M. Kalyanaraman B. Br. J. Pharmacol. 1996; 119: 511-518Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar, 20Konorev E.A. Tarpey M.M. Joseph J. Baker J.E. Kalyanaraman B. J. Pharmacol. Exp. Ther. 1995; 274: 200-206PubMed Google Scholar). In conclusion, the direct reduction of GSNO by the heme group of both myoglobin and hemoglobin leads to the formation of nitric oxide and the ferric heme derivative. This provides a mechanism for oxygen-dependent release of nitric oxide from GSNO by heme proteins and represents a potential physiological mechanism ofS-nitrosothiol metabolism. We thank Dr. B. Kalyanaraman and Dr. V. M. Darley-Usmar for stimulating discussions during the course of this work."

Recently, three different Csx/Nkx-2.5 mutations were found in patients with atrial septal defect and atrioventricular conduction delays (5Schott J.J. Benson D.W. Basson C.T. Pease W. Silberbach G.M.

A C to T transition at nucleotide 618 is predicted to substitute a termination codon (TAG) for glutamine (CAG) (hereafter designated as A), which would stop translation prematurely at position 33 of the homeodomain. A C to T transversion of nucleotide 642 is predicted to substitute methionine (ATG) for threonine (ACG) at homeodomain position 41 (hereafter designated as B). A C to T transversion at nucleotide 701 is predicted to substitute a termination codon (TAG) for glutamine (CAG) (hereafter designated asC), which would create a termination signal immediately after the homeodomain. A homeobox is a 180-bp1 conserved sequence motif that encodes a helix-turn-helix DNA binding domain called the homeodomain. It has been reported that the Csx/Nkx-2.5homeodomain is required for DNA binding and activation of a reporter gene, and a carboxyl terminus outside of the homeodomain composed mainly of clusters of alanines and prolines is an inhibitory domain forCsx/Nkx-2.5 transcriptional activity (6Chen C.Y.

Thus, it is hypothesized that A and B might impair binding of Csx/Nkx-2.5 to the target DNA resulting in haploinsufficiency and that C would enhance the transcriptional activity (5Schott J.J.

The zinc finger transcription factor GATA-4 also plays a critical role in the early steps of cardiac development.GATA-4 is expressed in the precardiac mesoderm almost simultaneously with Csx/Nkx-2.5 and earlier than any other known transcription factors implicated in cardiogenesis (8Heikinheimo M.

ANP is expressed at a very early embryonic stage when cells are committed to the cardiac phenotype. Throughout the embryonic and fetal development, ANPexpression is restricted to both atrial and ventricular myocardium, but it is not expressed in other tissues including skeletal and smooth muscle cells. In the present study, we examined the transcriptional activity of the ANP promoter as well as the DNA binding and association with GATA-4 of these mutants in COS-7 cells.

The GATA-4 bound to GST-Csx/Nkx-2.5 fusion proteins was resolved by SDS-PAGE and visualized by fluorography. Csx/Nkx-2.5 andGATA-4 were transfected into COS-7 cells or the cultured cardiomyocytes of neonatal rats plated on a cover glass. The cells were fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde solution for 30 min at room temperature and treated with 0.1% Triton X-100 for 2 min at 4 °C to improve permeability to the reagents. After washing them with PBS, the samples were incubated for 1 h at 37 °C with phalloidin-rhodamine (red) to identify filamentous actin. Myc-tagged WT, A, B, and C were detected by anti-Myc monoclonal antibody for 1 h, followed by incubation with an anti-mouse IgG conjugated to FITC (green) or rhodamine (red) for 1 h at 37 °C. To detect apoptotic cells, terminal deoxynucleotidyltransferase-mediated dUTP nick end-labeling (TUNEL) analysis was performed. 50 μl of TUNEL reaction mixture containing both terminal deoxynucleotidyltransferase and FITC-conjugated dUTP were added to each sample. These samples were analyzed by fluorescence microscopy. Statistical comparison of the control group with treated groups was carried out using one-way analysis of variance and Dunnett's t test. The accepted level of significance wasp < 0.05. We first examined whether and where Csx/Nkx-2.5 mutant proteins are expressed in COS-7 cells by transfecting the Myc-taggedCsx/Nkx-2.5 cDNAs into COS-7 cells. Western blot analysis using whole cell lysates revealed that all mutants as well asWT were expressed in COS-7 cells at comparable levels (Fig.1 A). Immunocytochemistry using anti-Myc antibody revealed that transfected Myc-tagged WT, B, and C were localized in the nucleus of both COS-7 cells and cardiac myocytes of neonatal rats (Fig. 1 B). Although A was localized in the nucleus of cardiac myocytes, A was diffusely distributed in the cytoplasm and nucleus in COS-7 cells (Fig. 1 B). We and others (12Durocher D. Charron F. Warren R.

To examine the transcriptional activity of the mutants, we transfected WT and each of these mutants with the 300-bp ANP-luc reporter into COS-7 cells.WT strongly activated the ANP promoter (Fig.2) as previously reported (16Shiojima I. Komuro I. Oka T. Hiroi Y. Mizuno T. Takimoto E. Monzen K. Aikawa R. Akazawa H. Yamazaki T. Kudoh S. Yazaki Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 8231-8239Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar).WT (0.2 μg) activated the ANP promoter by ∼8-fold (Fig. 2). The ANP promoter was also activated byB (∼2-fold) and C (∼6-fold) but not byA (Fig. 2). When the same amounts of mutant cDNA (0.1 μg) were cotransfected with WT (0.1 μg),WT-induced activation of the ANP promoter (∼6-fold) was modulated in different ways. The luciferase activity was attenuated by coexpression of A (∼6- to ∼3-fold) and by B (∼6- to ∼4-fold) (Fig. 2). In contrast,C enhanced the activity by ∼12-fold (Fig. 2). Similar results were obtained with the artificial reporter construct containing multimerized Csx/Nkx-2.5-binding sites (4X(TTF-1)-tk-luc) except for stronger activation by C (∼15-fold) than byWT (∼5-fold) (data not shown). These results suggest that the transcriptional activities of these three Csx/Nkx-2.5mutants are different. We next examined the DNA binding activity of each mutant using EMSA. We used nuclear extracts prepared from COS-7 cells, which were transfected withWT and the mutants, and the TTF-1-binding sequences, which are favorable binding sequences of Csx/Nkx-2.5 proteins (7Shiojima I. Komuro I. Mizuno T. Aikawa R. Akazawa H. Oka T. Yamazaki T. Yazaki Y. Circ. Res. 1996; 79: 920-929Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). The amount of each expressed protein was estimated by Western blot analysis, and the same amounts of proteins were used for EMSA. WT bound to TTF-1 binding sequences, and addition of the nonlabeled TTF-1 attenuated the WT binding, indicating that the binding was specific (Fig.3 A). C showed a stronger shifted band than WT, suggesting that the DNA binding affinity of C was stronger than that of WT. B very faintly bound to the DNA, and A showed no shifted band. The whole cell lysate as well as nuclear lysate ofA-transfected cells did not show TTF-1 binding, suggesting that A did not bind to the DNA sequence. To assess if these mutants affected WT binding to TTF-1-binding sequences, we mixed the same amounts of nuclear extracts of WT and of each mutant, and we performed EMSA. The DNA binding of WT was barely inhibited by any mutants (Fig.3 B). WT slightly enhanced the binding of C to TTF-1-binding sequences. These results suggest that these mutants have different DNA binding ability. Csx/Nkx-2.5and GATA-4activate several cardiac gene promoters including the ANP promoter in a synergistic manner (12Durocher D. Charron F. Warren R. Schwartz R.J. Nemer M.

We examined whether these mutants affect the synergistic effects of Csx/Nkx-2.5and GATA-4on the ANP promoter. Consistent with our previous results, cotransfection with WT and GATA-4 showed much stronger activation (∼15-fold) of the 300-bp ANPpromoter than single transfection with WT (∼8-fold) orGATA-4 (∼2-fold) (Fig. 4). The synergistic activation by WT and GATA-4 was inhibited by A and B, whereas it was further enhanced by C (Fig. 4). C alone had a stronger synergistic effect with GATA-4 on the ANPpromoter (∼20-fold) than WTdid (∼15-fold), whereasA or B had no effect on GATA-4-induced activation of the ANP promoter (∼2-fold) (Fig. 4). These results suggest that these mutants modulate the synergistic effects ofWTand GATA-4on the ANP promoter in different ways. Csx/Nkx-2.5 associates with GATA-4 and shows synergistic action on theANP promoter (12Durocher D. Charron F. Warren R. Schwartz R.J. Nemer M. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 5687-5696Crossref PubMed Scopus (550) Google Scholar, 14Lee Y. Shioi T. Kasahara H. Jobe S.M. Wiese R.J. Markham B.E. Izumo S. Mol. Cell.

Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 8231-8239Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar). To elucidate the mechanism of how these mutants affect the synergistic effects of WTandGATA-4on the ANP promoter, we examined whether these mutants also interacted with GATA-4. The GST pull-down assay revealed that WT and all mutants interacted with GATA-4 in vitro in the following order C > WT > B > A (Fig. 5 A). The coimmunoprecipitation assay also showed similar results. All Csx/Nkx-2.5 proteins, including WT and the mutants, also associated with GATA-4 in vivo in the same order as in vitro(Fig. 5 B, top). Since mutant C has enhanced function, it is unknown how mutant C induces the same cardiac defects asA and B. To address this question, we examined whether mutant C induces cell death in cardiomyocytes. We transfected the Myc-tagged WT and mutants into the cultured cardiomyocytes of neonatal rats and stained the cells by TUNEL methods. As shown in Fig. 6, although overexpression of WT, A, and B did not change the number of TUNEL-positive cells as non-transfected cells (∼3%), overexpression of C significantly increased the number of TUNEL-positive cells (10∼15%), suggesting that mutant Cmay induce apoptosis of cardiac myocytes during cardiac development. Transfected Myc-tagged cDNAs of WT, B, and Cwere localized in the nucleus, whereas that of A was diffusely distributed in the cytoplasm and nucleus of COS-7 cells. This result suggests that the nonsense mutation of A (Gln170ter) loses a nuclear localization signal. Since mutant C that lacks 3′ outside of the homeodomain was localized in the nucleus, there may be a nuclear localization signal between the 170 and 198 amino acids in the homeodomain, although there are no typical sequences of nuclear localization signals in that region. When transfected in the cultured cardiac myocytes, A was also localized in the nucleus (Fig.1), suggesting that A might be dragged into the nucleus by other factors that exist in the nucleus of cardiac myocytes but not of COS-7 cells. Transient transfection analysis revealed that WT increased the ANPpromoter activity by ∼8-fold as reported before (16Shiojima I. Komuro I. Oka T. Hiroi Y. Mizuno T. Takimoto E. Monzen K. Aikawa R. Akazawa H. Yamazaki T. Kudoh S. Yazaki Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 8231-8239Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar). MutantA did not show any transcriptional activity on theANP promoter, and B only weakly activated theANP promoter (∼2-fold). Since the 60-amino acid homeodomain plays a critical role in DNA binding of homeoproteins (17Harvey R.P. Dev. Biol. 1996; 178: 203-216Crossref PubMed Scopus (494) Google Scholar), we examined the DNA binding ability of A and B by EMSA. B weakly bound to the Csx/Nkx-2.5-binding DNA sequences but A did not bind at all. Many studies on the homeoprotein-DNA complex have shown that the third helix of the homeodomain contacts with the major grooves of DNA (18Kissinger C.R. Liu B.S. Martin B.E. Kornberg T.B. Pabo C.O. Cell. 1990; 63: 579-590Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (802) Google Scholar, 19Otting G. Qian Y.Q. Billeter M. Muller M. Affolter M. Gehring W.J. Wuthrich K.

Mutant A, which lacks the third helix, was thought not to bind to DNA. Although the role of the threonine codon at homeodomain position 41 between helix II and helix III is not clear, the threonine at 41 is highly conserved in NK class homeoproteins (17Harvey R.P. Dev. Biol. 1996; 178: 203-216Crossref PubMed Scopus (494) Google Scholar), suggesting that the threonine is also critical for DNA binding at least of NK family proteins. As reported by Schott et al. (5Schott J.J. Benson D.W. Basson C.T. Pease W. Silberbach G.M. Moak J.P. Maron B.J. Seidman C.E. Seidman J.G. Science. 1998; 281: 108-111Crossref PubMed Scopus (1101) Google Scholar), the three differentCsx/Nkx-2.5 mutations found in patients with atrial septal defect and atrioventricular conduction delays are all heterozygous mutations. Thus, to elucidate whether the induction of congenital heart diseases by these mutations is mediated by haploinsufficiency or by dominant negative manner, we cotransfected the same amount ofWT and A or B, together with theANP promoter. Overexpression of A or Binhibited WT-induced activation of the ANPpromoter, suggesting that both A and B function in a dominant-negative manner. It remains to be determined how Aand Binhibit the transcriptional activity ofWT. Recent studies have shown that the carboxyl-terminal region ofCsx/Nkx-2.5 acts as a transcriptional repressor (6Chen C.Y. Schwartz R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 15628-15633Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (271) Google Scholar, 7Shiojima I. Komuro I. Mizuno T. Aikawa R. Akazawa H. Oka T. Yamazaki T. Yazaki Y. Circ. Res. 1996; 79: 920-929Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). In the present study, mutant C, which is truncated just after the homeodomain, showed a stronger transcriptional activity (∼15-fold) than WT (∼5-fold) on 4X(TTF-1)-tk-luc. When cotransfected with WT, C showed an additive effect on ANP promoter activation (∼12-fold). As shown by EMSA, C bound to the DNA more strongly than WT (Fig. 3), suggesting that the carboxyl-terminal region of Csx/Nkx-2.5 may suppress its transcriptional activity at least in part by inhibiting its DNA binding. GATA-4 is also a cardiac-enriched transcription factor that is expressed in the precardiac mesoderm from the very early developmental stages.GATA-4 and Csx/Nkx-2.5 showed a synergistic action not only on promoter activation of cardiac genes (12Durocher D.

Shiojima I. Hiroi Y. Kudoh S. Oka T. Takimoto E. Hayashi D. Habara-Ohkubo A. Nakaoka T. Fujita T. Yazaki Y. Komuro I. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 7095-7105Crossref Scopus (214) Google Scholar). Overexpression ofGATA-4 induced an ∼2-fold activation of the ANPpromoter. When A or B was cotransfected withGATA-4, no synergistic activation was observed. MutantA even inhibited GATA-4-induced activation of theANP promoter. However, cotransfection of WT orC with GATA-4 showed synergistic activation by ∼15- and ∼20-fold, respectively. When GATA-4 andWT were cotransfected with each of the three mutants,A and B inhibited GATA-4- andWT-induced synergetic activation of the ANPpromoter, whereas C further enhanced the activation by ∼30-fold. Previous studies indicated that GATA-4-Csx/Nkx-2.5 synergistic action required the interaction of the two factors and that the minimal interaction regions were the homeodomain ofCsx/Nkx-2.5 and the second zinc finger of GATA-4(13Sepulveda J.L.

Kudoh S. Yazaki Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 8231-8239Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar). Furthermore, the mutant with deletion of helix II and III of the Csx/Nkx-2.5 homeodomain was unable to bind to GATA-4 (13Sepulveda J.L. Belaguli N. Nigam V. Chen C.Y. Nemer M. Schwartz R.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 3405-3415Crossref PubMed Scopus (277) Google Scholar). In the present study, coimmunoprecipitation and GST pull-down assay indicated that all of the three mutants bound to GATA-4, although mutant A, which lacks part of helix II and helix III, showed a weaker binding to GATA-4 than other Csx/Nkx-2.5 proteins (Fig. 5). The binding affinity of B to GATA-4 did not decrease, suggesting that the threonine at the homeodomain position 41 was not critical for the association with GATA-4. In contrast, C showed a stronger binding affinity to GATA-4. These results and observations suggest that the carboxyl-terminal region of Csx/Nkx-2.5 may mask the homeodomain and inhibit the association of Csx/Nkx-2.5 with GATA-4. Since GATA-4 and full-length Csx/Nkx-2.5 showed similar transcriptional activity with the carboxyl-terminally deleted Csx/Nkx-2.5mutant (13Sepulveda J.L. Belaguli N. Nigam V. Chen C.Y. Nemer M. Schwartz R.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 3405-3415Crossref PubMed Scopus (277) Google Scholar), it was hypothesized that GATA-4 relieved the autorepression of Csx/Nkx-2.5 by the carboxyl-terminal inhibitory domain (12Durocher D. Charron F. Warren R. Schwartz R.J. Nemer M. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 5687-5696Crossref PubMed Scopus (550) Google Scholar, 13Sepulveda J.L. Belaguli N. Nigam V. Chen C.Y. Nemer M. Schwartz R.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 3405-3415Crossref PubMed Scopus (277) Google Scholar). In this study, however, GATA-4-C showed a stronger synergistic effect on the ANP promoter than GATA-4-WT. Although the reason for this discrepancy is unknown at present, our results suggest that GATA-4 shows synergistic effects with Csx/Nkx-2.5 by not only displacing the carboxyl-terminal inhibitory domain but also by activating transcription. Although mutants A and B may cause congenital cardiac defects by the impaired transcriptional activity, it was unknown how mutant C, which has enhanced transcriptional activity, induces the same cardiac abnormality. We thus examined whether mutant C may induce apoptosis of cardiac myocytes. Overexpression of C but not WT, A, orB induced apoptosis of cultured cardiac myocytes.Csx/Nkx-2.5 regulates expression of various cardiac genes in the developing heart, such as ANP, BNP, N-myc, MEF2C, HAND1, and Msx2 (22Tanaka M. Chen Z. Bartunkova S. Yamasaki N. Izumo S. Development. 1999; 126: 1269-1280Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Endogenous ANPmRNA levels are increased in the hearts of humanCsx/Nkx-2.5-overexpressing transgenic mice (23Takimoto E. Mizuno T. Terasaki F. Shimoyama M. Honda H. Shiojima I. Hiroi Y. Oka T.

Commun. 2000; 270: 1074-1079Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar), also suggesting that ANP is a direct target gene ofCsx/Nkx-2.5 in vivo. ANP has been reported to induce apoptosis in cultured neonatal rat cardiac myocytes (24Wu C.F. Bishopric N.H. Pratt R.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 14860-14866Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (224) Google Scholar). InDrosophila, D-MEF2, which belongs to theMEF2 (myocyte enhancer factor-2) subfamily of MADS box transcription factors, is the only known direct target oftinman (25Gajewski K. Kim Y. Lee Y.M. Olson E.N. Schulz R.A. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 515-522Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar). Two members of mammalian MEF2subfamily, MEF2B and MEF2D, have been reported to play an important role in apoptosis of T cells (26Youn H. Sun L. Prywes R. Liu J. Science. 1999; 286: 790-793Crossref PubMed Scopus (236) Google Scholar). It is possible that C up-regulates Csx/Nkx-2.5-target genes such as ANP and MEF2 and that these genes induce apoptosis of cardiac myocytes in the developmental heart. The precise mechanism by which C induces apoptosis in vitro and whether C also induces apoptosis in vivo remain to be elucidated."

Although nucleotide specificity and specific activities vary among the NTPDases, other characteristics such as insensitivity to typical ATPase inhibitors and cation dependence for activity are invariable (1Plesner L. Int. Rev. Cytol. 1995; 158: 141-214Crossref PubMed Scopus (447) Google Scholar). The NTPDases all have their active sites outside the cytoplasm of the cell and exist as either ecto-, endo-(luminal), or soluble apyrases whose activities have been speculated to be involved in processes as diverse as neurotransmission, N- andO-glycosylation, cardiac function, platelet aggregation, cell adhesion, muscle contraction and relaxation, vascular tone, secretion of hormones, immune responses, and cell growth (2Zimmermann H. Drug Dev. Res. 1996; 39: 337-352Crossref Scopus (150) Google Scholar). The ecto-apyrases hydrolyze nucleoside diphosphates at rates comparable to nucleoside triphosphates and are perhaps the best studied of all the NTPDases; they include eNTPDase1 (CD39) (3Schulte am Esch 2nd, J.

Biphys. 1970; 137: 133-142Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar) and sequenced (8Wang T.-F. Ou Y. Guidotti G. J. Biol.

Biophys. 1997; 337: 351-359Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). In addition, human soluble eNTPDase5, also known as CD39L4 (14Chadwick B.P. Frischauf A.M. Genomics. 1998; 50: 357-367Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar), has recently been expressed and characterized (15Mulero J.J. Yeung G. Nelken S.T. Ford J.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 20064-20067Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). In the present study we expressed and characterized the putative soluble human eNTPDase6, also known as CD39L2 (14Chadwick B.P. Frischauf A.M. Genomics. 1998; 50: 357-367Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar). This ecto-nucleotidase has properties distinct from eNTPDase5 (CD39L4), as well as from the other ecto-, endo-, and soluble NTPDases. In clarified media from eNTPDase-expressing COS-1 cells, its specific activity is 89 μmol of Pi/mg/h (using GDP as substrate) with nucleotide preference for GDP = IDP > GTP > ITP > UDP > CDP > UTP > CTP > ADP > ATP. eNTPDase6 exists predominantly as an approximately 50-kDa soluble, monomeric protein. It is postulated that the membrane-bound form contains a 78-amino acid signal peptide, which is cleaved after insertion into and through the cell membrane resulting in release of the soluble ecto-nucleotidase into the extracellular space. Epicurian coli ultracompetent bacteria were purchased from Stratagene. Plasmid purification kits were purchased from Qiagen, Inc. LipofectAMINE Plus reagent, Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium, calf serum, goat anti-rabbit horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibody, and antibiotics/antimycotics were all obtained from Life Technologies. Falcon tissue culture-treated plates were from Becton-Dickinson. The mammalian expression vector pcDNA3 was obtained from Invitrogen. Restriction endonucleases and T4 DNA ligase were purchased from Promega. Ampicillin, nucleotides, diethylpyrocarbonate (DEPC), and Sephacryl S-200 were purchased from Sigma. The human eNTPDase6 cDNA was isolated and sequenced and has been described previously (14Chadwick B.P. Frischauf A.M. Genomics. 1998; 50: 357-367Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar). The 2762-bp eNTPDase6 cDNA insert was excised from a pLXPIH retroviral expression vector and inserted into the 5.4-kb pcDNA3 mammalian expression vector using EcoRI and XbaI restriction endonucleases. This construct was used to transiently transfect COS-1 cells using LipofectAMINE Plus reagent as described previously (16Smith T.M. Kirley T.L. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 1509-1516Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar, 17Lewis Carl S.A. Kirley T.L. J. Biol.

Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 321-328Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar), to characterize the expressed enzyme. Crude (total) cell membrane preparations were harvested as described previously (16Smith T.M. Kirley T.L. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 1509-1516Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar, 17Lewis Carl S.A. Kirley T.L. J. Biol.

Briefly, COS-1 membranes from cells transfected with eNTPDase6 cDNA were harvested 72 h after transfection. Cell membranes were harvested by scraping the culture plates in tissue homogenization buffer (THB) consisting of 30 mm MOPS/NaOH (pH 7.4), 250 mm sucrose, and 2 mm EDTA, followed by homogenization in a glass homogenizer with a Teflon pestle (Thomas Scientific, Swedesboro, NJ). The cell homogenate was centrifuged at 48,000 rpm in a Ti-50 rotor (150,000 × g) for 60 min at 4 °C. The pellet was resuspended in a small volume of THB, homogenized again, and used for biochemical assay. When culture media was to be collected for harvesting of soluble nucleotidase, the COS-1 cells were transferred to incomplete media 24 h after transfection (48 h before harvesting the media). Culture media was collected and centrifuged at 48,000 rpm for 1 h to remove particulate material. The clarified media, approximately 30 ml, was concentrated to 1.5 ml using a Centriprep-30 concentrator, as recommended by the manufacturer (Amicon). Nucleotidase activity was determined by measuring the amount of inorganic phosphate released from nucleotide substrates at 37°C using a modification of the technique of Fiske and SubbaRow (19Fiske C.H. SubbaRow Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1925; 66: 375-400Abstract Full Text PDF Google Scholar), as described previously (4Smith T.M. Kirley T.L. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1998; 1386: 65-78Crossref PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar). Protein concentrations were determined using the Bio-Rad CB-250 dye binding technique according to the modifications of Stoscheck (20Stoscheck C.M. Anal. Biochem. 1990; 184: 111-116Crossref PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar), using bovine serum albumin as the standard. SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis was performed according to Laemmli (21Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (205531) Google Scholar), and blotted onto polyvinylidene difluoride membrane (22Matsudaira P. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 10035-10038Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) for Western analysis as described previously (18Smith T.M. Kirley T.L. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 321-328Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar). Concentrated culture media from transfected COS cells was applied to a Sephacryl S-200 column equilibrated in 20 mm MOPS, 5 mmMgCl2, pH 7.4. Fractions were collected and assayed for nucleotidase activity. Bovine γ globulin (158 kDa), bovine serum albumin (66 kDa), ovalbumin (44 kDa), myoglobin (17 kDa), and vitamin B-12 (1.35 kDa) were used to calibrate the Sephacryl S-200 column. Size exclusion column fractions found to contain the majority of GDPase activity were pooled and used for ion exchange chromatography. First, 300 μl was diluted to 1.0 ml with 20 mm MOPS, 2 mm MgCl2, pH 7.6, and applied to a quaternary ammonium MemSep anion exchange column (Millipore) equilibrated with the same buffer. 5-ml samples were sequentially eluted in 1.0-ml aliquots with MOPS buffer containing no NaCl, 0.1 m NaCl, 0.2 m NaCl, and 1.0 m NaCl. Fractions identified as containing GDPase activity were applied to a sulfo-propyl MemSep cation exchanger (Millipore) equilibrated with the same MOPS buffer. Fractions were eluted and collected as described above. The anti-peptide polyclonal antisera used in this study was raised (by Lampire Biological Laboratories, Pipersville, PA) against a peptide corresponding to the extreme COOH terminus of the eNTPDase6-deduced protein sequence (acetyl-(C)FAYIDSLNRQKSPAS-COOH). The peptide was synthesized and conjugated to keyhole limpet agglutinin (KLH) by Quality Controlled Biochemicals, Inc., Hopkinton, MA, via the NH2-terminal cysteine residue. The crude antisera was affinity purified using the Pierce Chemical Company SulfoLink kit (catalogue number 44895), covalently attaching the peptide via the NH2-terminal cysteine on the peptide, as described by the manufacturer. For monitoring the effect of deglycosylation on enzyme activity under non-denaturing conditions, samples of crude media (0.2 mg/ml total protein), containing soluble eNTPDase6, and, separately, membrane-bound eNTPDase6 (1.6 mg/ml) were diluted to 0.1 mg/ml in deglycosylation buffer consisting of 30 mm MOPS, 2 mm EDTA, 0.02% saponin, pH 7.2. At 0 min, 4 μl (80 units) of control (boiled) or active (non-boiled) PNGase-F deglycosylation enzyme (Roche Molecular Biochemicals) was added to the eNTPDase6 samples and incubated at 37 °C. After various incubation times at 37 °C, 10-μl aliquots were removed from the reaction tubes and diluted with nucleotidase assay buffer (20 mm Tris, 1 mm EGTA, 7 mmMgCl2, 100 mm KCl, pH 7.0), and used to determine GDPase activity as described above. For complete deglycosylation by PNGase-F under denaturing conditions, samples were acetone-precipitated with 4 volumes of acetone overnight at −20 °C, pelleted, redissolved in 0.2% SDS, and heated before diluting with buffer and incubating with PNGase-F overnight at 37 °C. Laemmli sample buffer was then added, and the samples were Western blotted (see Fig. 2). Modification of COS cell-expressed eNTPDase6 was performed using 1 mm DEPC in 20 mm MOPS, pH 7.4, containing 5 mm MgCl2 at 22 °C. Aliquots were taken at various times and stopped by dilution into ice cold MOPS buffer containing excess histidine. The DEPC reaction was reversed by adding hydroxylamine to a final concentration of 100 mm at 16 min. NTPDase6 was expressed in COS cells and characterized as both soluble and membrane-bound forms. The results of nucleotidase assays from three separate transfections are summarized in TableI. The soluble form of eNTPDase6 demonstrated the highest specific activity with IDP (101 μmol/mg/h) and GDP (89 μmol/mg/h). Lower nucleotidase activities were observed using UDP and CDP; 33% and 23%, respectively, of that observed with IDP. Soluble eNTPDase6 exhibited very low activity with all nucleoside triphosphates used as well as with ADP (<10 μmol/mg/h). Although 90% of the total recovered GDPase and IDPase activity was found to be associated with the soluble form of eNTPDase6, the membrane-bound form was also characterized. The membrane-bound form of eNTPDase6, from crude total membranes, also demonstrated the highest specific activity with inosine and guanosine nucleotides. Unlike soluble eNTPDase6, the membrane-bound form showed a slight preference for hydrolysis of most nucleotide triphosphates. One notable exception was a significant preference for GDP (10 μmol/mg/h) over GTP (3 μmol/mg/h). Nucleotidase activity of both the soluble and membrane-bound forms of eNTPDase6 GDPase activities were examined for cation dependence, because this is a defining characteristic for members of the eNTPDase family (1Plesner L. Int. Rev. Cytol. 1995; 158: 141-214Crossref PubMed Scopus (447) Google Scholar). The soluble form was found to be highly dependent on the presence of divalent cations for optimal activity as is seen in TableII. In the absence of cations, specific activity for GDP hydrolysis was 1.1 μmol/mg/h, whereas optimal GDPase activity was 74 μmol/mg/h in the presence of 2 mmMnCl2. All concentrations of MnCl2, MgCl2, and CaCl2 tested resulted in significant increases of GDPase activity over that observed in the absence of cations. The membrane-bound form of eNTPDase6 also was found to be dependent on the presence of cations for optimal GDPase activity. In the absence of cations, GDPase activity was 0.3 μmol/mg/h, whereas GDPase activity was optimal in the presence of 10 mmMgCl2 (6 μmol/mg/h).Table ISpecific activity of soluble and membrane-bound eNTPDase6NucleotideSoluble eNTPDase6Membranous eNTPDase6μmol of Pi/mg/hGDP89 ± 279 ± 2GTP8 ± 43 ± 1IDP101 ± 2112 ± 2ITP7 ± 22.4 ± 1UDP30 ± 104 ± 1UTP4 ± 15 ± 2CDP18 ± 81 ± 1CTP10 ± 76 ± 3ADP3 ± 10.6 ± 0.3ATP1 ± 0.21 ± 1Nucleotidase assays were performed as described under “Experimental Procedures” in the presence of 7 mm MgCl2 and 2.5 mm nucleotide (as shown).

All activities have been COS background-corrected and are represented in micromoles of Pi/mg/h as well as percentages of the highest activity achieved with the soluble and membranous eNTPDase6, respectively. The soluble form of eNTPDase6 was partially purified using size exclusion chromatography, anion exchange chromatography, and cation exchange chromatography. Serum-free media was collected from COS-1 cells expressing eNTPDase6 over 3 days, as described under “Experimental Procedures.” The media was concentrated to 1 ml and loaded onto a Sephacryl S-200 size exclusion column. The calibration plot for the standards (bovine serum albumin, ovalbumin, myoglobin, vitamin B-12), as well as the fraction containing maximum GDPase activity, is shown in Fig. 1. The fractions containing the majority of the GDPase activity corresponded to a molecular mass of ∼50 kDa. This molecular mass agrees well with the theoretical weight for a soluble, monomeric eNTPDase6 protein as determined from translation of the cDNA (theoretical non-glycosylated molecular mass = 45 kDa, assuming signal cleavage at amino acid 78, predicted by computer analysis). After size exclusion chromatography, both anion and cation exchange chromatography were used to further characterize and purify the soluble eNTPDase6 109-fold as is shown in Table III. After the final step of purification, the purified soluble eNTPDase6 had a average (n = 2) specific activity with GDP of 9227 μmol/mg/h.Table IIIPartial purification of soluble eNTPDase6SampleTotal proteinTotal activitySpecific activityPurificationμgμmol Pi/hμmol Pi/mg/h-foldClarified media3152685S-200 column1795336Anion exchange0.250.42168120Cation exchange0.0160.1459227109The summation for purification of soluble eNTPDase6 is shown in Table 3.

Open table in a new tab The summation for purification of soluble eNTPDase6 is shown in Table 3. Starting material for purification was 30 ml of clarified, serum free, growth media from eNTPDase6-expressing COS-1 cells, which had been concentrated to 1.5 ml as described under “Experimental Procedures.” The average of two separate transfections and purifications is shown. An anti-eNTPDase6 polyclonal antibody was developed, affinity purified, and used for Western blot analysis and immunoprecipitation. As seen in Fig. 2, the anti-eNTPDase6 antibody reacted specifically with an approximately 50-kDa protein in both eNTPDase6-expressing COS cell membranes and media (lanes 1and 5). The 50-kDa protein band was not present when COS cell control membranes were probed with the anti-eNTPDase6 antibody. The-50 kDa band also was not present when membranes and media were probed with pre-immune sera (not shown). Also shown in Fig. 2 is the shift in molecular mass of both the soluble and membrane-bound forms after treatment with PNGase-F, indicating both forms are N-glycosylated (lanes 2 and 6). In addition, the anti-eNTPDase6 antibody was able to immunoprecipitate 84% of the GDPase activity from media obtained from COS cells expressing eNTPDase6. The dependence of eNTPDase6 activity on glycosylation was determined by treating both the membrane-bound and soluble forms with PNGase-F under conditions, which previously resulted in significant loss of glycan chains and activity of eNTPDase1 and eNTPDase3 (HB6 (16Smith T.M. Kirley T.L. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 1509-1516Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar)). There was no significant difference in activity between those eNTPDase6 samples treated with active PNGase-F and those control samples treated with heat-inactivated PNGase-F (data not shown). However, Western blot analysis of eNTPDase6 treated with active PNGase-F indicated the presence of two glycosylation sites (Fig.3), as is evidenced by the presence of three discrete protein bands corresponding to eNTPDase6 protein with 2, 1, or 0 glycan chains attached (see arrows in Fig. 3 between the “−” and “+” lanes incubated for 3.5 h). Diethylpyrocarbonate (DEPC) is an inhibitor of eNTPDases, presumably due to histidine modification (23Miles E.W. Methods Enzymol. 1977; 47: 431-442Crossref PubMed Scopus (810) Google Scholar, 24Saborido A. Moro G. Megias A. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 23490-23498Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Both the soluble and membrane-bound forms of eNTPDase6 were treated with DEPC followed by hydroxylamine to reverse histidine modification. As shown in Fig.4, DEPC treatment of the soluble form of eNTPDase6 inhibited GDPase activity 60%. However, hydroxylamine treatment was unable to reverse the inhibition caused by DEPC treatment. Similar results were obtained with the membrane-bound form of eNTPDase6 (Fig. 4). This paper describes the first expression of the soluble human nucleotidase eNTPDase6 (CD39L2), and for the first time, the characterization of both soluble and membrane-bound forms of the eNTPDase6. To date there have been several reports of soluble eNTPDases from organisms as diverse as plants (10Cori-Traverso A. Traverso S. Reyes H. Arch. Biochem. Biphys. 1970; 137: 133-142Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar), Tetrahymena (13Smith Jr., T.M. Kirley T.L. Hennessey T.M. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1997; 337: 351-359Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar), mosquitoes (11Arca B. Lombardo F. de Lara Capurro M. della Torre A. Dimopoulos G. James A. Coluzzi M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 1516-1521Crossref PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar), and humans (15Mulero J.J. Yeung G. Nelken S.T. Ford J.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 20064-20067Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar); however, most studies have focused strictly on the soluble forms, and comparative studies with their respective membrane-bound forms have not been reported. In this study, we found notable differences in nucleotide preference and cation dependence between the two forms of eNTPDase6, yet similarities in size, DEPC response, and lack of importance of glycosylation. From hydropathy plots of the deduced amino acid sequence, it was postulated that eNTPDase6 (CD39L2) has a single potential transmembrane domain at the NH2 terminus, suggesting the possibility of membrane attachment via a signal sequence (14Chadwick B.P. Frischauf A.M. Genomics. 1998; 50: 357-367Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar). Moreover, computer analysis of the translated amino acid sequence of the eNTPDase6 cDNA revealed a putative signal sequence at amino acid 78 (76TRA↓APG80) which, if cleaved, should result in a soluble form. To characterize eNTPDase6 and determine if it exists as a predominantly soluble or membrane-bound form, we transiently expressed eNTPDase6 in COS-1 cells. Low nucleotidase activity (0.6–12 μmol/mg/h) was found associated with the eNTPDase6-expressing COS-1 cell membranes (Table I), suggesting the majority of the activity is secreted into the media. Approximately 90% of total GDPase activity was found associated with the soluble form of eNTPDase6 (Table I). Both the soluble and membrane-bound forms of eNTPDase6 demonstrated preference for inosine and guanosine nucleotides (Table I). The nucleotide hydrolysis ratio for GDP and GTP (i.e.GDPase:GTPase activity) was approximately 11 for the soluble form of eNTPDase6. The soluble potato (ADPase:ATPase = 1.0) (10Cori-Traverso A. Traverso S. Reyes H. Arch. Biochem. Biphys. 1970; 137: 133-142Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar) and endoplasmic reticulum (UDPase:UTPase = 5.0) (9Trombetta S. Helenius A. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 3282-3292Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar) eNTPDases have lower nucleotide hydrolysis ratios, whereas the soluble eNTPDase5 (UDPase:UTPase = 34) (15Mulero J.J. Yeung G. Nelken S.T. Ford J.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 20064-20067Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar) has a higher nucleotide hydrolysis ratio making the soluble eNTPDase6 unique in its nucleotide preference among the soluble eNTPDases. Overall, soluble eNTPDase6 hydrolyzed nucleoside triphosphates very poorly and exhibited a strong preference for purine and pyrimidine nucleoside diphosphates with oxygen at positions 6 and 4, respectively. The membrane-bound form of eNTPDase6 differed in that it hydrolyzed some nucleoside triphosphates slightly better than nucleoside diphosphates with a notable exception in the case of guanosine nucleosides, where the GDPase:GTPase activity ratio was 3.3:1. As shown in Table II, both forms of eNTPDase6 were dependent on the presence of cations for optimal activity, a characteristic universally found in other members of the eNTPDase family (1Plesner L. Int. Rev. Cytol. 1995; 158: 141-214Crossref PubMed Scopus (447) Google Scholar, 7Gao X.D. Kaigorodov V. Jigami Y. J. Biol.

Pharmacol. 1999; 128: 396-402Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). Soluble eNTPDase6 was partially purified using size exclusion, anion exchange, and cation exchange chromatography. Fractions from the S-200 size exclusion column containing the majority of the GDPase activity were found to correspond with a molecular size of approximately 50 kDa (Fig. 1), as is predicted from the cDNA sequence of eNTPDase6. This molecular size is consistent with a monomer, and not consistent with a homo-oligomer of soluble enzyme. This is concordant with previous findings that soluble eNTPDase enzymes are monomeric (10Cori-Traverso A. Traverso S. Reyes H. Arch. Biochem. Biphys. 1970; 137: 133-142Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar, 26Smith T.M. Kim M.Y. Kirley T.L. Hennessey T.M. Plesner L. Kirley T.L. Knowles A.F.

Cell Biol. 1996; 218: 916-923Google Scholar), whereas membrane-bound forms are tetrameric (8Wang T.-F. Ou Y. Guidotti G. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 24814-24821Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar, 28Hicks-Berger C.A. Kirley T.L. IUBMB Life. 2000; 50: 43-50Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). It has been speculated (14Chadwick B.P. Frischauf A.M. Genomics. 1998; 50: 357-367Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar) that eNTPDase6 (CD39L2) would be released as a soluble enzyme after cleavage of the NH2-terminal signal sequence. The theoretical pI of the deduced amino acid sequence of eNTPDase6, including the hydrophobic NH2-terminal signal peptide sequence, is 9.91. If the soluble eNTPDase6 is generated by cleavage after Ala-78 as predicted by computer analysis of the sequence, then the resultant soluble form is predicted to have a theoretical, non-glycosylated pI = 7.52, and therefore should not bind to either anion or cation exchange resins at physiological pH. Chromatography was therefore performed under conditions (pH 7.4) that would not promote binding to either cation or anion exchangers. Using both the anion and cation columns, soluble GDPase activity was found in fractions that did not bind to either column (see “Experimental Procedures”). This indicates that the prediction of cleavage of a signal sequence after Ala-78 is most likely correct, because this would eliminate many positively charged amino acids, resulting in a 45-kDa soluble protein with a greatly reduced pI, close to 7.4, consistent with the purification results. A polyclonal anti-peptide antibody (against a COOH-terminal non-conserved region of eNTPDase6) was developed to further study both the soluble and membrane-bound forms of eNTPDase6. As shown in Fig. 2, a single protein at approximately 50 kDa was recognized in the eNTPDase6-expressing cells and media that was not observed in control cell membranes. Computer sequence analysis predicts two potentialN-glycosylation sites for eNTPDase6. PNGase-F was used to deglycosylate eNTPDase6 to determine the extent of glycosylation required for GDPase activity. From activity data we found no difference in GDP hydrolysis between those samples treated with active PNGase-F as compared with those treated with heat-inactivated PNGase-F. These experiments were done under identical conditions used to demonstrate both deglycosylation and loss of activity of eNPTDase1 and eNTPDase3 (16Smith T.M. Kirley T.L. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 1509-1516Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). However, the presence of two glycosylation sites was confirmed by Western blot analysis of PNGase-F-treated eNTPDase6 (Fig. 3). These data are consistent with our hypothesis that deglycosylation of eNTPDases decreases nucleotidase activity by disrupting normal quaternary structure, which is not present in the monomeric, soluble eNTPDase6 (16Smith T.M. Kirley T.L. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 1509-1516Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). DEPC is recognized as a general inhibitor of eNTPDase activity, presumably due to modification of histidine residues in the eNTPDases, because histidine modification is most consistent with the pH dependence of inactivation and the reversibility with NH2OH (23Miles E.W.

DEPC-induced histidine modification and enzyme inhibition can be reversed by the addition of hydroxylamine to the reaction mixture, whereas tyrosine modification reverses more slowly, and lysine and cysteine modifications are not reversible (23Miles E.W. Methods Enzymol. 1977; 47: 431-442Crossref PubMed Scopus (810) Google Scholar). We found that both forms of eNTPDase6 were inhibited by DEPC approximately 60% (Fig. 3), which is comparable to what has been reported for eNTPDase3 (70%) 2C. A. Hicks-Berger, F. Yang, T. M. Smith, and T. L. Kirley, manuscript in preparation. and eNTPDase1 (80% (30Dzhandzhugazyan K.N. Plesner L. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2000; 1466: 267-277Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar)). However, unlike other eNTPDases studied, this inhibition was most likely due to DEPC modification of non-histidine residues, because it was not reversed by hydroxylamine (even at higher concentrations than used in Fig. 3, data not shown). In summary, this report describes the expression and characterization of both the membrane-bound and soluble forms of eNTPDase6 (CD39L2). The expressed protein possesses shared characteristics of the ecto-apyrases such as cation dependence and sensitivity to DEPC. eNTPDase6 is unique in that it is the first soluble eNTPDase that prefers GDP and IDP as substrates. Human eNTPDase6 is much more widespread in its tissue distribution than the only other soluble human ecto-nucleotidase described to date, eNTPDase5 (CD39L4 (15Mulero J.J. Yeung G. Nelken S.T. Ford J.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 20064-20067Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar)). eNTPDase5 (CD39L4) was shown in two studies to be rather limited in its tissue distribution (14Chadwick B.P. Frischauf A.M. Genomics. 1998; 50: 357-367Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar, 15Mulero J.J. Yeung G. Nelken S.T. Ford J.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 20064-20067Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar), unlike the eNTPDase6 described here (CD39L2), for which mRNA has been found for all tissues tested (14Chadwick B.P. Frischauf A.M. Genomics. 1998; 50: 357-367Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar). The broad tissue distribution of eNTPDase6 (CD39L2) suggests the possibility that the range of functions or the importance of the physiological function(s) for this soluble nucleotidase might exceed that of the narrowly expressed, soluble eNTPDase5 (CD39L4). After acceptance of this work, N-terminal amino acid sequencing of soluble eNTPDase6 indicated that cleavage between Arg-76 and Ala-77 separates the N terminus signal peptide from the remainder of the soluble protein."

However, the identification of the mechanisms underlying TSA-mediated growth arrests has remained elusive. In order to resolve in more detail the cellular process modulated during the growth inhibition induced by TSA, we studied the effect of the drug on G0/G1 traverse in mitogen-stimulated quiescent Balb/c-3T3 cells. Cyclin D1 and retinoblastoma proteins were induced following the mitogenic stimulation of both control and TSA-treated cells, and cyclin D1 formed complexes with CDK4 under both conditions. However, cyclin D1-associated kinase was not increased in growth-arrested cells. The lack of cyclin D-associated kinase was paralleled by an accumulation of RB in a hypophosphorylated form, as would be expected. In contrast, p130 became partially phosphorylated, accompanied by a marked increase in p130-dependent E2F DNA binding activity and a partial release of free E2F-4. Despite the presence of E2F complexes not bound to pocket proteins, late G1 E2F-dependent gene expression was not observed. The lack of cyclin D1-associated kinase in TSA-treated cultures was potentially due to high levels of the cyclin-dependent inhibitor p27 kip1 . However, the modulation of p27 kip1 levels by the deacetylase inhibitor cannot be responsible for the induction of the cell cycle arrest, since the growth of murine embryo fibroblasts deficient in both p27 kip1 and p21 cip1 was also inhibited by TSA. These data support a model in which TSA inhibits very early cell cycle traverse, which, in turn, leads to a decrease in cyclin D1-associated kinase activation and a repression of late cell cycle-dependent events.

Alterations in early G0/G1 gene expression accompany the TSA-mediated growth arrest. histone deacetylase trichostatin A platelet-derived growth factor fetal calf serum plasminogen activator inhibitor-2 retinoblastoma Histone acetylation/deacetylation has long been proposed to play a critical role in the regulation of transcription (1Allfrey V.G. Proc. Can. Cancer Res. Conf. 1966; 6: 313-335PubMed Google Scholar). Core histones are acetylated at amino-terminal lysine residues, causing a net neutralization of positive charge and a decrease in affinity for DNA (2Wolffe A.P. Science. 1996; 272: 371-373Crossref PubMed Scopus (272) Google Scholar). Such changes have been postulated to increase the ability of transcriptional regulators to access regulatory regions in structurally relaxed chromatin. The reverse reaction, the deacetylation of histones, would then be presumed to increase the strength of histone/DNA interactions and decrease the access of transcription complexes to localized regions of DNA (3Wu C. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 28171-28174Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (194) Google Scholar, 4Struhl K. Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 599-606Crossref PubMed Scopus (1541) Google Scholar). Consistent with these hypotheses, histone acetylase activity has been found associated with several transcriptional co-activators (5Mizzen C.A. Yang X.-Y. Kobubo T. Brownell J.E. Bannister A.J.

Cell. 1997; 89: 341-347Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (656) Google Scholar). Multiple homologs of mammalian histone deacetylase (HDAC)1 have been identified. HDAC1 was isolated as a factor that binds to trapoxin, a bacterial product that inhibits HDAC activity (9Taunton J. Hassig C.A. Schreiber S.L. Science. 1996; 272: 408-411Crossref PubMed Scopus (1527) Google Scholar). HDAC1 is a homolog ofRPD3, a yeast gene that plays an important role in the global regulation of transcription. HDAC2 was subsequently identified in a two-hybrid screen as a binding partner for the transcriptional repressor YY1 (7Yang M.-W. Inouye C. Zang Y. Bearss D. Seto E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 12845-12850Crossref PubMed Scopus (482) Google Scholar). HDAC3 corresponds to an expressed sequence tag sequence with homology to HDAC1 and HDAC2 (10Yang W.-M. Yao Y.-L. Sun J.-M. Davie J.R. Seto E. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 28001-28007Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (398) Google Scholar). Additional HDAC isoforms have been identified based on either homology to the known genes or by functional assays (11Wang A.H. Bertos N.R. Vezmar M. Pelletier N. Crosato M. Heng H.H. Th'ng J. Han J. Yang X.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 7816-7827Crossref PubMed Scopus (257) Google Scholar, 12Grozinger C.M. Hassig C.A. Schreiber S.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 4868-4873Crossref PubMed Scopus (649) Google Scholar). The identification of HDAC cDNAs in several organisms has provided evidence that the biological actions of these enzymes might be more complicated than earlier predicted. RPD3, the yeast gene homologous to HDAC, was originally isolated as a protein required for both positive and negative regulation of transcription (13Vidal M. Gaber R.F. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1991; 11: 6317-6327Crossref PubMed Scopus (262) Google Scholar). In addition, some aspects of telomeric silencing in both yeast and Drosophilaare prevented by the expression of RPD3 (14De Rubertis F. Kadosh D. Henchoz S. Pauli D. Reuter G. Struhl K. Spierer P. Nature. 1996; 384: 589-591Crossref PubMed Scopus (194) Google Scholar). Inhibitors of deacetylases have also been reported to induce, rather than repress, the expression of specific classes of genes in mammalian cells (15Wharton W. Hart C.A. Goz B. In Vitro. 1979; 15: 861-864Crossref PubMed Scopus (4) Google Scholar, 16Siavoshian S. Blottiere H.M. Cherbut C. Galmiche J.-P. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1997; 232: 169-172Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). These results suggest that the acetylation of histones might play both positive and negative roles in gene expression due to variables that have not yet been described. There have been suggestions that HDAC activity plays a role in the repression of E2F-dependent transcription mediated by members of the RB family of pocket proteins. A direct interaction between HDAC1 and either p130 or RB has been found in both in vitro binding assays and in vivo coimmunoprecipitation experiments (17Luo R.X. Postigo A.A. Dean D.C. Cell. 1998; 92: 463-473Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (837) Google Scholar, 18Ferreira R. Magnaghi-Jaulin L. Robin P. Harel-Bellan A. Trouche D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 10493-10498Crossref PubMed Scopus (224) Google Scholar). Whether HDAC1 also binds p107 has been the subject of some controversy (18Ferreira R. Magnaghi-Jaulin L. Robin P. Harel-Bellan A. Trouche D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 10493-10498Crossref PubMed Scopus (224) Google Scholar). HDAC inhibitors such as trichostatin A (TSA) prevent RB-mediated transcriptional repression of transfected E2F-dependent reporter gene constructs (17Luo R.X. Postigo A.A. Dean D.C. Cell. 1998; 92: 463-473Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (837) Google Scholar). The repression of cyclin A transcription in quiescent NIH 3T3 cells (19Stiegler P. De Luca A. Bagella L. Giordano A. Cancer Res. 1998; 58: 5049-5052PubMed Google Scholar) andcdc25A transcription in transforming growth factor-β-treated keratinocytes (20Iavarone A. Massague J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 916-922Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar), both mediated through the binding of RB family members to E2F sites in the 5′ regulatory regions, has also been shown to be relieved by TSA. However, if inhibitors of HDAC activity acted only by relieving RB-mediated repression of E2F-dependent transcription, they would be predicted to stimulate cell cycle traverse, since expression of E2F in quiescent cells has, at least under some circumstances, been found to be mitogenic (21Johnson D.G. Schwarz J.K. Cress W.D. Nevins J.R. Nature. 1993; 365: 349-352Crossref PubMed Scopus (833) Google Scholar, 22Shan B. Lee W.-H. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 8166-8173Crossref PubMed Scopus (473) Google Scholar). HDAC inhibitors instead inhibit the proliferation of a number of cell types (23Archer S.Y. Meng S. Shei A. Hodin R.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. 1998; 95: 6791-6796Crossref PubMed Scopus (497) Google Scholar, 24Nakano K. Mizuno T. Sowa Y. Orita T. Yoshino T. Okuyama Y. Fijita T. Ohtani-Fujita N. Matsukawa Y. Tokino T. Yamagishi H. Oka T. Nomura H. Saki T. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 22199-22206Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (372) Google Scholar). In many cases, the inhibition of growth has been accompanied by an increase in the transcription of p21 cip1 . However, in cultured mouse fibroblasts, deletion of p21 cip1 did not affect the ability of HDAC inhibitors to cause a cell cycle arrest, and instead, a repression of cyclin D1 expression was postulated to mediate the growth inhibition (25Vaziri C. Sticce L. Faller D.V. Cell Growth Differ. 1998; 9: 465-474PubMed Google Scholar). In this paper, we have characterized the ability of TSA to inhibit the proliferation of mitogen-stimulated density-arrested Balb/c-3T3 cells. The TSA-induced growth arrest could not be attributed to the actions of either p21 cip1 or p27 kip1 , or to a repression of cyclin D1 expression. However, cyclin D1-associated kinase activity was repressed in TSA-treated cells, probably through a p27 kip1 -dependent process, leading to a unique and complex alteration in the expression and modification of RB family members. Stock cultures of Balb/c-3T3 cells were maintained in α-minimal essential medium supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum (FCS), 50 units/ml penicillin, and 50 μg/ml streptomycin in a humidified atmosphere of 5% CO2 and were subcultured on a 3-day schedule as described previously (26Pledger W.J. Stiles C.D. Antoniades H.N. Scher C.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1978; 75: 2838-2839Crossref Scopus (373) Google Scholar). Cells to be used in experiments were seeded into 100-mm plates at an initial density of approximately 5 × 105 cells/dish. Fresh medium was added 3 days later, and experiments were performed after a further 5–6-day period (2–3 days after the cells reached density-dependent growth arrest). Cultures of murine fibroblasts were established from day 14 embryos derived from a cross between p27 kip1 (+/−);p21 cip1 (−/−) parents. Lines deficient in both CDIs were identified by polymerase chain reaction genotyping and verified by Western analysis. Stock cultures of double knockout cells were maintained as described above. Cells were removed from plates with PBS containing 0.125% trypsin and 0.5 mm EDTA. The cell slurry was added to an equal volume of Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 10% serum to neutralize the trypsin and centrifuged. The cell pellet was thoroughly resuspended in 1 ml of PBS, and 4 ml of 95% ethanol were slowly added. Cells were stored in the fixative for at least 24 h at 4 °C prior to analysis. Samples were centrifuged, and cell pellets were resuspended in PBTB (PBS containing 0.1% Tween 20 and 0.05% bovine serum albumin) with 10 μg/ml RNase A and 50 μg/ml propidium iodide. After incubation at 4 °C for a minimum of 4 h, cell cycle distributions were analyzed with a Becton Dickinson FACScan by the H. Lee Moffitt Cancer Center Flow Cytometry Core Facility. RNA was prepared using an RNeasy Mini Kit (Qiagen) and separated in a 1% agarose/formaldehyde gel. For Northern analyses, the RNA was transferred to Gene Screen Plus. Following UV cross-linking, blots were hybridized with a radiolabeled probe, washed, and visualized by autoradiography by standard techniques (27Ausubel F.M. Brent R. Kingston R.E. Moore D.D. Seidman J.G. Smith J.A. Struhl K. Current Protocols in Molecular Biology. John Wiley & Sons, Inc., New York1998: 4.9.1-4.9.13Google Scholar). For a reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction analysis, the RNA, whose quantitation was verified by the denaturing electrophoresis analysis described above, was transcribed and amplified using a OneStep RT-PCR Kit, also from Qiagen. Preliminary experiments verified that the conditions were chosen to ensure that the size of the amplified product was directly proportional to mRNA levels. Plates were placed on ice, rinsed twice with cold PBS, and scraped into 1 ml of PBS. Following a brief centrifugation, the supernatant was aspirated, and the cell pellet was flash-frozen in a dry ice/ethanol bath. Frozen pellets were thawed in immunoprecipitation buffer (50 mm Hepes (pH 7.2), 250 mm NaCl, 0.1% Tween 20, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 1 mm EGTA, 1 mm EDTA, 0.1 mmorthovanadate, 0.5 mm sodium fluoride, 0.25 mmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and 2.5 μg/ml leupeptin). Aliquots containing 40 μg of total cellular protein were separated by discontinuous SDS gel electrophoresis and transferred to nitrocellulose membranes. Blots were incubated in PBST (PBS containing 0.1% Tween 20) containing 5% nonfat dry milk to reduce nonspecific binding and rinsed, and PBST containing primary antibody was added. Following an overnight incubation, blots were rinsed and exposed to secondary antibodies conjugated with horseradish peroxidase. Complexes were visualized by ECL according to the manufacturer's instructions. Cells were harvested as described above. Cyclin-specific antisera were added to 80 μg of cellular protein in a total volume of 350 μl of immunoprecipitation buffer, and the mixture was rocked for 2 h at 4 °C. Twenty μl of 25% protein A-agarose beads were added, and the samples were mixed for an additional 1 h. Immune complexes were centrifuged, washed twice with immunoprecipitation buffer and once with kinase buffer (50 mm Hepes (pH 7.5), 10 mmMgCl2, 5 mm MnCl2, 10 mm dithiothreitol), resuspended in 10 μl of kinase buffer containing 10 μCi of [γ-32P]ATP, 10 μmATP, and 1 μg of GST-RB for cyclin D assays or 1 μg of histone H1 for cyclin A or cyclin E assays, and incubated at 30 °C for 15 min. Ten μl of 2× loading dye were added to stop the reaction, and samples were heated to 95 °C for 3 min. Proteins were separated on 12% SDS-polyacrylamide gels, and radiolabeled substrate was visualized by autoradiography. E2F DNA binding assays were performed essentially as described (28Flores A.M. Kassatly R.F. Cress W.D. Oncogene. 1998; 16: 1289-1298Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). Cell extracts were incubated at room temperature for 30 min in binding buffer (20 mm Hepes (pH 7.9), 40 mm KCl, 6 mmMgCl2, 1 mm EGTA, 1 mmdithiothreitol, 0.1% Nonidet P-40, 30 μg/ml bovine serum albumin, 500 ng/ml sonicated salmon sperm DNA) containing 0.1 ng of32PO4-labeled DNA fragment (residues −103 to −23 from the dihydrofolate reductase promoter) containing an E2F recognition site. Complexes were resolved by electrophoresis in a 5% polyacrylamide gel (75:1 acrylamide/bisacrylamide) in TBE containing 5% glycerol and visualized by autoradiography. Supershifts were performed in a similar manner except that extracts were incubated with antibodies for 30 min at room temperature prior to the incubation with the labeled DNA fragment. Buffers, detergents, and salts were obtained from Sigma. Culture medium, fetal calf serum, and antibiotics were from Life Technologies, while PDGF was purchased fromBIOSOURCE. Trichostatin A was from Waco Pure Chemical Industries. Secondary antibodies, ECL reagents, and radioisotopes were from Amersham Pharmacia Biotech. Antibodies were purchased from either Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc. (Santa Cruz, CA) (RB, p107, cyclin D1, and p130), Pharmingen (RB, p21 cip1 ), or Transduction Laboratories (p130). The cyclin A antibody was a gift from Dr. E. B. Leof, and the p27 kip1 antibody was raised locally against a His-p27 fusion protein. The ability of inhibitors of HDAC activity to modulate cellular proliferation has been previously described. However the underlying alterations in cyclin/CDK activity that mediate or reflect this growth inhibition have been difficult to establish, in part because most of these studies have been performed with transformed cells. Such model systems suffer from difficulties in cell cycle synchronization as well as preexisting alterations in cyclin/CDK metabolism characteristic of neoplastic cells. In order to more precisely describe the effects of HDAC inhibitors on the induction and activation of components of the cyclin/CDK pathway, we determined the actions of TSA on the growth properties of Balb/c-3T3 cells, a well characterized model of cell cycle regulation. Quiescent, density-arrested cultures of Balb/c-3T3 cells were stimulated by the addition of fresh medium containing 5% FCS and 10 ng/ml PDGF-BB together with increasing concentrations of TSA. At 22 h following refeeding, the plates were harvested, and DNA distributions were determined by flow cytometry. As shown in Fig.1 A, at the time of restimulation cells were quiescent, with 95% of the population containing a 2 n content of DNA. After treatment with fresh medium supplemented with PDGF and FCS in the absence of TSA, only 20% of the cells remained in G0/G1. The addition of TSA at concentrations greater than 0.3 ng/ml caused a dose-dependent decrease in the entry of cells into S phase, with a complete inhibition of growth observed at 10 ng/ml. TSA was, therefore, a potent inhibitor of a process required for the initiation of DNA synthesis in density-arrested Balb/c-3T3 cells stimulated with fresh medium containing PDGF and serum. Since TSA inhibited the ability of stimulated Balb/c-3T3 cells to enter S phase, we determined the pattern of expression of proteins induced in late G0/G1 in TSA-treated cells (Fig. 1 B). Neither p107 nor cyclin A was detectable in quiescent cultures, although the expression of both proteins was markedly induced 18 h after restimulation. The addition of TSA caused a dose-dependent decrease in the expression of these proteins that paralleled the decrease in DNA synthesis. Only minor decreases in expression were observed at 0.3 ng/ml TSA. The addition of 1 or 3 ng/ml TSA, where there were intermediate decreases in entry into S phase, as shown in Fig. 1 A, caused further decreases in the levels of both cyclin A and p107. At 10 ng/ml TSA, where the restimulation of mitogenesis was completely inhibited, the induction of both proteins was completely abolished. Since TSA has been reported to increase the expression of Stra 13, with a subsequent repression of c-myc expression (29Sun H. Taneja R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 4058-4063Crossref PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar), it was at least possible that the inhibition of entry into S phase seen in Fig.1 A was due to a repression of the PDGF-mediated increase inmyc levels that are required for G0/G1 traverse (30Pelengaris S. Rudolph B. Littlewood T. Curr. Opin. Genet. Dev. 2000; 10: 100-105Crossref PubMed Scopus (175) Google Scholar, 31Elend M. Eiler M. Curr. Biol. 1999; 9: R936-R938Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). As shown in Fig.2A, c-myc RNA was undetectable in quiescent cells and markedly induced 1 h following the addition of PDGF. By 6 h following stimulation, levels returned almost to those seen prior to the addition of PDGF. The addition of TSA together with PDGF affected neither the increase seen at early times nor the subsequent decrease in c-myc RNA levels, suggesting that there was not a global repression of immediate early gene expression in TSA-treated cells. We next investigated whether the inductions of transcripts that are potentially direct downstream targets of immediate early genes are modulated in growth-inhibited cells. Plasminogen activator inhibitor-2 (PAI-2) mRNA is induced in stimulated quiescent cells in a manner that requires multiple mitogens and continuous protein synthesis, making it an example of a secondary response gene. 2W. Wharton, J. Savell, W. Douglas Cress, E. Seto, and W. J. Pledger, unpublished observation. As shown in Fig. 2 A, PAI-2 message was not detected in quiescent Balb/c-3T3 cells and was induced 4 h following the addition of fresh medium supplemented with PDGF and serum. The addition of medium containing only TSA did not cause an increase in PAI-2 expression. Co-addition of TSA together with PDGF and serum did not repress the induction mediated by mitogenic stimulation and instead markedly enhanced expression. Therefore, at least one marker of the exit from G0/G1 was expressed in cells whose growth was inhibited by treatment with TSA. Since the RB family of proteins may be involved in the regulation of late G1/S phase traverse, including the modulation of processes involving the expression of cyclin A and p107, we investigated the effects of TSA on the expression and phosphorylation of RB, as shown in Fig. 3 A. Low levels of RB protein were seen in quiescent cells. The addition of medium supplemented with PDGF and serum caused an induction of RB expression as well as a predominant shift to the hyperphosphorylated form. While the addition of TSA at concentrations up to 100 ng/ml did not inhibit the increase in RB protein levels after stimulation of quiescent cells, there was a dose-dependent decrease in RB phosphorylation in TSA-treated cells that, in general, paralleled the decrease in the expression of late G0/G1 gene expression as well as entry into S phase. Another RB family member that is phosphorylated by a mechanism similar to that involved in RB modification and that is thought to be involved in the regulation of G0/G1 traverse is p130. The effects of TSA on mitogen-induced alterations in p130 phosphorylation are shown in Fig. 3 B. In quiescent cells, p130 was found as three isoforms, termed A, B, and C, that have been shown to differ in the extent of phosphorylation (32Mayol X. Garriga J. Grana X. Oncogene. 1995; 11: 801-808PubMed Google Scholar). Eighteen h following the addition of PDGF and serum, the two fastest migrating forms of p130 were not present, and the amount of the slowest migrating form decreased by over 50%. When cells were restimulated in the presence of 3 or 10 ng/ml TSA, conditions where there were marked decreases in the number of cells induced to enter S phase, p130 accumulated in the intermediate B isoform, with only very low levels of forms A and C remaining. Therefore, the modifications that convert p130 from the intermediate to the slowest migrating form, leading eventually to p130 degradation, are blocked in TSA-treated cells. The phosphorylation of both p130 and RB lead to modifications in the binding of members of the E2F family of transcription factors. The results of gel shifts using a labeled DNA probe containing the E2F binding site from the dihydrofolate reductase promoter and extracts from TSA-treated cells are shown in Fig. 3 C. Quiescent cells contained a predominant single DNA binding complex that was identified as containing p130 by supershifts with a panel of antibodies against RB family members (data not shown), with no evidence of “free” E2F DNA binding complexes. Cells stimulated for 18 h with PDGF and serum contained no residual p130 complexes, although a new high molecular weight complex containing p107 (based on supershifts) appeared, as did a smear of “free” E2F binding activity corresponding to multiple members of the E2F family that are induced as cells progress through G0/G1. Extracts of cells stimulated in the presence of TSA had marked elevations in the level of DNA binding activity associated with p130. In addition, a distinct band of “free” E2F was seen that was identified by comigration and antibody reactivity as E2F-4 (data not shown). Therefore, the processes responsible for the degradation of the p130 isoform with the slowest mobility were not inhibited by TSA, nor was the conversion of form A into form B. However, p130 was modified in some manner in cells stimulated with PDGF and serum in the presence of TSA such that the total DNA binding capacity was increased accompanied by a modest accumulation of “free” E2F DNA binding activity. The lack of phosphorylation of RB and p130 in TSA-treated cultures suggests that the induction of cyclin D-associated kinase activity was modulated by the deacetylase inhibitor. The effects of TSA on the induction of kinase activity associated with cyclin D1-CDK4 complexes are shown in Fig. 4 A. Cyclin D1-associated kinase activity measured in an in vitro assay using RB as a substrate was low in quiescent cells and increased between 6 and 9 h following stimulation with medium supplemented with PDGF and serum. Peak activity was seen at 12 h with levels steadily declining toward base line between 15 and 21 h. The addition of 10 ng/ml TSA to the medium at the time of stimulation with PDGF and serum abolished the induction of kinase activity associated with cyclin D1. These results suggest that the growth arrest invoked by TSA was temporally prior to the mitogen-stimulated cell cycle-dependent events that lead to the activation of the cyclin/CDK cascade. Based on the results shown above we investigated the mechanism by which TSA inhibits cyclin D1-associated kinase activity, first by determining the ability of TSA to alter the induction of cyclin D1 protein following stimulation with mitogens. Density-arrested Balb/c-3T3 cells were stimulated with fresh medium containing 5% FCS and 10 ng/ml PDGF together with 10 ng/ml TSA. As can be seen in Fig.4 B, quiescent cells did not contain measurable levels of cyclin D1 protein. Following stimulation with medium supplemented with PDGF and serum alone, there was a 4–5-fold increase in the expression of cyclin D1. Co-addition of TSA together with fresh mitogens did not markedly alter the induction of cellular levels of cyclin D1. Therefore, the inhibition of cyclin D1-associated kinase activity in cells stimulated in the presence of TSA could not be accounted for by a repression of cyclin D1 protein expression. The lack of cyclin D1-associated kinase activity was also not due to a failure of cyclin D1 protein to associate with CDK4. Cultures treated in parallel to those shown in Fig. 4 B were harvested, and cyclin D1 (together with associated proteins) was immunoprecipitated. Complexes were disrupted and separated on denaturing gels, and levels of CDK4 were determined by Western analysis. As shown in Fig.4 C, the amount of CDK4 coprecipitated with cyclin D1 was equivalent in cells stimulated with medium containing PDGF and serum alone (that had robust kinase activity) or with mitogens together with TSA (conditions where there was a repression of cyclin D1-associated kinase activity). We next investigated whether alterations in levels of protein inhibitors of cyclin-dependent kinase activity could account for the lack of cyclin D1-associated kinase activity. Density-arrested Balb/c-3T3 cells have been shown to have an elevated level of p27 kip1 . Following mitogenic stimulation, p27 kip1 levels are markedly reduced by a combination of translational repression and increased instability (33Agrawal D. Hauser P. McPherson F. Dong F. Garcia A.

In order to determine the effects of TSA on the reduction in p27 kip1 levels following mitogenic stimulation, quiescent cells were treated for 18 h in medium supplemented with 10 ng/ml PDGF, 5% FCS, and various concentrations of TSA. Cellular levels of p27 kip1 were determined using immunoblots. As shown in Fig. 4 D, the elevated levels of protein seen in q"

D., Ruurs, P., Wiedmer, T., Sims, P., Borst, J., and van Blitterswijk, W. J. (2000) J. Cell. Biol. 150, 155–164). To evaluate the functional significance of this Cer pool, we aimed to convert it to glucosylceramide (GlcCer), by constitutive overexpression of glucosylceramide synthase (GCS). Jurkat cells, retrovirally transduced with GCS cDNA, showed a 10–12-fold increase in GCS activityin vitro and a 7-fold elevated basal GlcCer level in vivo. However, Cer accumulating during apoptosis induced by ligation of the death receptor CD95, treatment with the anti-cancer drug etoposide, or exposure to γ-radiation was not glycosylated by GCS. Likewise, Cer liberated at the plasma membrane by bacterial SMase was not converted by the enzyme. Thus, GCS, located at the Golgi, is topologically segregated from Cer produced in the plasma membrane. In contrast, de novo synthesized Cer as well as an exogenously supplied cell-permeable Cer analog were efficiently glycosylated, apparently due to different Cer topology and distinct physicochemical behavior of the synthetic Cer species, respectively. Exogenous cell-permeable Cer species, despite their conversion by GCS, effectively induced apoptosis. We also observed that GCS activity is down-regulated in cells undergoing apoptosis. In conclusion, GCS can convert de novo synthesized Cer but not SM-derived Cer, and, therefore, the ability of GCS overexpression to protect cells from possible detrimental effects of Cer accumulation is limited.

Different kinetics and mechanisms of Cer formation have been reported, which may be related to the different stimuli and cell types used. In certain cases, Cer was found to be produced in a biphasic manner, whereas other studies only document a late and sustained Cer response during the execution phase of apoptosis (1Hannun Y.A.

Sci. 1998; 23: 374-377Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar). Cer can result from sphingomyelin (SM) hydrolysis, catalyzed by neutral or acid sphingomyelinase (SMase) activities. Both SMase activities have been implicated in Cer production upon apoptotic stimuli including TNFα, CD95, anti-cancer drugs, and γ-radiation (5Wiegmann K. Schutze S. Machleidt T. Witte D. Kronke M.

Cer can also be synthesized de novo in the endoplasmic reticulum, starting with the condensation of serine and palmitoyl-CoA (10Mandon E.C. Ehses I. Rother J. van Echten G. Sandhoff K. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 11144-11148Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Increased de novo synthesis was reported to be responsible for Cer production during daunorubicin- and etoposide-induced apoptosis (11Bose R. Verheij M. Haimovitz-Friedman A. Scotto K. Fuks Z.

We have documented that Cer accumulation in Jurkat cells in response to CD95 ligation, etoposide treatment, or γ-irradiation is a consequence of inducer caspase activation and effectively takes place during the execution phase of apoptosis (13Tepper A.D. de Vries E. van Blitterswijk W.J. Borst J. J. Clin. Invest. 1999; 103: 971-978Crossref PubMed Scopus (166) Google Scholar). Our most recent work (14Tepper A.D. Ruurs P. Wiedmer T. Sims P. Borst J. van Blitterswijk W.J. J. Cell Biol. 2000; 150: 155-164Crossref PubMed Scopus (172) Google Scholar) revealed the mechanism underlying this late Cer response; SM residing in the outer leaflet of the plasma membrane gains access to an intracellular neutral SMase as a consequence of lipid scrambling, a universal hallmark of the apoptotic execution phase. We have also provided evidence that the relevance of this SM to Cer conversion lies in the depletion of the plasma membrane of SM. SM is an important structural component of the plasma membrane, contributing to its rigidity by interaction with cholesterol. Failure to hydrolyze SM was accompanied by lack of membrane blebbing, whereas replenishment of SM prevented the apoptotic blebbing process. Although our previous work provides no evidence for Cer as potential second messenger in the apoptotic process, we sought to unveil such a role of Cer by attenuating its levels. Since the SMase responsible for Cer formation in our system has not been molecularly defined, abrogation of Cer production can as yet not be achieved by mutation of this enzyme. However, cellular Cer levels are regulated by enzymatic conversion to other sphingolipids, which provides a tool for intervention. Cer can be (re-)utilized for SM synthesis, degraded to sphingosine or further metabolized to glucosylceramide (GlcCer) or galactosylceramide. GlcCer synthesis is catalyzed by glucosylceramide synthase (GCS) (15Ichikawa S. Sakiyama H. Suzuki G. Hidari K.I. Hirabayashi Y. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 4638-4643Crossref PubMed Scopus (221) Google Scholar), a resident type III integral membrane protein on the cytosolic side of the cis/medial Golgi membrane (16Futerman A.H. Pagano R.E. Biochem. J. 1991; 280: 295-302Crossref PubMed Scopus (246) Google Scholar,17Jeckel D. Karrenbauer A. Burger K.N.J. van Meer G. Wieland F. J. Cell Biol. 1992; 117: 259-267Crossref PubMed Scopus (259) Google Scholar). After its translocation to the Golgi lumen by a yet undefined mechanism, GlcCer can be further metabolized to higher glycosphingolipids including GM3 and GD3 gangliosides (18Ichikawa S. Hirabayashi Y. Trends Cell Biol. 1998; 8: 198-202Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (183) Google Scholar). It was previously suggested that glycosylation of Cer can protect cells from cancer drug-induced apoptosis. Accumulation of GlcCer was observed in multidrug-resistant tumor cells (19Lavie Y. Cao H. Bursten S.L. Giuliano A.E. Cabot M.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 19530-19536Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (310) Google Scholar), and overexpression of GCS in MCF-7 breast cancer cells conferred resistance to adriamycin and TNFα (20Liu Y.Y.

Cabot M.C. Exp. Cell Res. 1999; 252: 464-470Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). These findings would support the idea that glycosylation of Cer attenuates its capacity to act as a second messenger. In this paper, we report that constitutive overexpression of GCS by retroviral transduction of the cDNA into Jurkat cells greatly enhanced glycosylation of de novo synthesized Cer and exogenously added short chain Cer species. However, the Cer pool generated from plasma membrane SM in response to anti-cancer regimens, CD95 ligation or treatment with bacterial SMase was not accessible to the enzyme. This finding underscores that the intracellular site of Cer production is a key factor in determining its further metabolism and therewith its functional potential. In addition, it was observed that GCS activity is down-regulated during the apoptotic process. Together, these factors limit the possibility to attenuate the Cer response to apoptotic stimuli by increased CGS activity. N-[1-(2,3-Dioleoyloxy)propyl]-N,N,N-trimethylammonium methylsulfate transfection reagent was obtained from Roche Molecular Biochemicals. Zeocin was from Kyla.l-[3-14C]Serine (54.0 mCi/mmol) and the enhanced chemiluminescence system (ECL) were purchased from Amersham Pharmacia Biotech.

Michiels, Netherlands Cancer Institute, Amsterdam, The Netherlands). This vector is a derivative of LZRS-pBMN-lacZ, which was provided by Dr. G. Nolan (Stanford University School of Medicine, Stanford, CA). The Jurkat clone J16, which has been selected for sensitivity to CD95 stimulation and T cell antigen receptor expression, was cultured as described (22Tepper A.D. Boesen de Cock J.G. de Vries E.

Nolan) by calcium phosphate precipitation (23Kinsella T.M. Nolan G.P. Hum. Gene Ther. 1996; 7: 1405-1413Crossref PubMed Scopus (672) Google Scholar). Virus-containing supernatant was harvested 48 h after transfection and stored at −80 °C until further use. Jurkat cells were transduced at a density of 0.5 × 106 cells/ml of virus-containing supernatant in the presence of 10 μg/mlN-[1-(2,3-Dioleoyloxy)propyl]-N,N,N-trimethylammonium methyl sulfate. Supernatants were removed after overnight incubation, and cells were cultured in fresh medium. Selection of transduced cells was initiated after 24 h by the addition of 200 μg/ml Zeocin. The selection process was completed within 2 weeks. Transduced cells were further cultured in the presence of 200 μg/ml Zeocin. GCS activity of transduced Jurkat cells was determined in vitro and in vivo,based on conversion of the fluorescent cell permeable Cer analog C6-NBD-Cer to C6-NBD-GlcCer. For the in vitro activity assay, cells resuspended in homogenization buffer (20 mm HEPES, pH 7.2, 120 mmK+-glutamate, 15 mm KCl, 5 mm NaCl, 0.8 mm CaCl2, 2 mmMgCl2, and 1.6 mm EGTA) were lysed by sonication (Branson; six bursts at level 4). C6-NBD-Cer (5 nmol/sample) was dried under nitrogen, dissolved in 10 μl of ethanol, and added to homogenization buffer containing 5 mmMnCl2, 1 mm UDP-glucose, and 0.3% fatty-acid free bovine serum albumin. Lysate containing 50 μg of protein (determined by Bio-Rad protein assay) was added to this reaction mixture. After incubation at 37 °C, lipids were extracted and separated by TLC (chloroform/methanol/25% NH4OH; 70:30:5 v/v). NBD-lipids were visualized by UV illumination. In some cases, lipids were scraped and extracted from the silica with 2 ml of chloroform/methanol/HAc (1:2.2:1 v/v). Silica was spun down, and the extracted NBD fluorescence was measured in a fluorimeter (excitation, 470 nm; emission, 535 nm). A standard curve was obtained with C6-NBD-Cer. For the in vivo GCS assay, 5 × 106 cells were resuspended in Hanks' medium buffered with 10 mm HEPES, pH 7.4, containing 5 μmC6-NBD-Cer (added in Hanks' medium containing 1% bovine serum albumin). Under these conditions, C6-NBD-Cer is converted to both C6-NBD-GlcCer and C6-NBD-SM. After incubation, lipids were extracted and NBD-lipids were analyzed as described above. To monitor the fate of endogenously produced C6-NBD-Cer during apoptosis, cells (2.5 × 106) were incubated with 4 μmC6-NBD-SM (in Hepes-buffered Hanks' medium) 10 min prior to apoptosis induction by anti-CD95 antibody (7C11; 200 ng/ml). To determine the in vivo GCS activity during apoptosis induction, cells were exposed to anti-CD95 antibody, etoposide or γ-radiation, bacterial SMase, or left untreated. C6-NBD-Cer was added (5 μm final concentration) to the cell suspensions 30 min prior to harvest, and lipids were extracted and analyzed as described above. Intracellular Cer, GlcCer and SM levels were determined following metabolic labeling with [14C]serine as described previously (22Tepper A.D. Boesen de Cock J.G. de Vries E.

Total lipid extracts were separated by TLC, and lipid spots were quantitated by phosphorimaging. Sphingolipid levels were expressed relative to the radioactivity incorporated into phosphatidylserine plus phosphatidylethanolamine, which remained unaltered upon gene transduction or stimulation of the cells. For apoptosis measurements, cells were seeded at 1 × 106 cells/ml, 200 μl/well in round-bottom 96-well microtiter plates in serum-free Yssel's medium (25Yssel H. de Vries J.E. Koken M. van Blitterswijk W.J. Spits H. J. Immunol. Methods. 1984; 72: 219-227Crossref PubMed Scopus (342) Google Scholar) and incubated for at least 6 h prior to apoptosis induction. Cells were lysed in 0.1% sodium citrate, 0.1% Triton X-100, and 50 μg/ml propidium iodide (26Nicoletti I. Migliorati G. Pagliacci M.C. Grignani F. Riccardi C.A. J. Immunol. Methods. 1991; 139: 271-279Crossref PubMed Scopus (4431) Google Scholar). Fluorescence intensity of propidium iodide-stained DNA was determined in 5000 cells on a FACScan (Becton Dickinson, San Jose, CA), and data were analyzed using Lysys software. Fragmented, apoptotic nuclei are recognized in this assay by their subdiploid DNA content. Transduction of Jurkat T cells (J16) with a retroviral vector containing the human GCS cDNA or empty vector yielded the stable cell lines J16-Zeo-GCS and J16-Zeo, respectively. Utilizing the fluorescent Cer analog C6-NBD-Cer and UDP-glucose, we analyzed whether gene transduction resulted in enhanced GCS activity. In vitroC6-NBD-GlcCer production in cell lysate of J16-Zeo-GCS was dramatically elevated, being 15-fold higher than in lysates of parental J16 cells or J16-Zeo vector control cells (Fig.1, A and B). When the cell-permeable C6-NBD-Cer was presented to intact cells, J16-Zeo-GCS exhibited a 2.8–3.0-fold increase in vivo GCS activity compared with control cells (Fig.2, A and B). Under these conditions, C6-NBD-Cer was also converted to C6-NBD-SM and C6-NBD-GalCer (Fig.2 A). These results clearly demonstrate that J16-Zeo-GCS cells overexpress a catalytically active GCS.Figure 1Effect of GCS transduction on in vitro GCS activity. C6-NBD-GlcCer production in parental (J16), vector-transduced (J16-Zeo), or GCS-transduced (J16-Zeo-GCS) Jurkat cells was determined using C6-NBD-Cer as a substrate.

Panel A, NBD-lipid analysis by TLC. Total lipid extracts were separated by TLC, and NBD-lipids were visualized under UV light. C6-NBD-Cer is predominantly metabolized to C6-NBD-GlcCer and C6-NBD-SM and to a minor extent to C6-NBD-GalCer, as was verified using lipid standards.

For this, J16-Zeo and J16-Zeo-GCS cells were metabolically labeled with [14C]serine, which incorporates into the sphingoid backbone of all sphingolipids. A comparison between the relative amounts of radiolabeled lipids in the two cell lines revealed striking differences: In J16-Zeo-GCS cells, basal GlcCer was 7-fold increased, basal SM levels were decreased by ∼30%, whereas basal Cer was elevated to ∼170% of control values (Fig.3). We confirmed by lipid charring that the differences observed represent changes in mass rather than altered incorporation of [14C]serine into the lipids (data not shown). To investigate whether GCS overexpression could attenuate the Cer response to apoptotic stimuli, radiolabeled J16-Zeo and J16-Zeo-GCS cells were induced to undergo apoptosis by CD95 ligation or exposure to the DNA-damaging regimens etoposide or γ-radiation. Regardless of the stimulus used, Cer accumulated in GCS-overexpressing cells to the same extent as in vector control cells (Figs. 4 and 5 (A andB)). Although basal GlcCer was dramatically elevated in J16-Zeo-GCS cells (Fig. 3), apoptotic stimuli did not increase this GlcCer level any further, despite a 3–4-fold elevation of Cer. These findings suggest that overexpressed GCS targets basal Cer but not the pool of Cer, which accumulates during apoptosis, possibly due a to difference in subcellular localization between agonist-induced Cer and basal Cer. To explore this possibility, we investigated whether the source of Cer accumulation during apoptosis was different from that of basal, i.e. de novo generated, Cer. In our cell system, treatment with 25 μm fumonisin B1 (FB1) during 24 h efficiently blocks de novo Cer synthesis without causing significant cell toxicity (14Tepper A.D. Ruurs P. Wiedmer T. Sims P. Borst J. van Blitterswijk W.J. J. Cell Biol. 2000; 150: 155-164Crossref PubMed Scopus (172) Google Scholar). We previously showed that CD95 ligation still induces Cer production in FB1-pretreated cells, indicating that it is not a resultant of enhanced de novoCer synthesis (14Tepper A.D. Ruurs P. Wiedmer T. Sims P. Borst J. van Blitterswijk W.J. J. Cell Biol. 2000; 150: 155-164Crossref PubMed Scopus (172) Google Scholar). In an analogous experiment, we investigated the source of DNA damage-induced Cer. [14C]Serine-labeled J16 cells were treated with FB1 (24 h; 25 μm) to block thede novo pathway and subsequently exposed to etoposide (10 μg/ml) or γ-radiation (20 Gy). After 16 h of incubation in the continued presence of FB1, the Cer content was 3.9 ± 0.5-fold (etoposide) and 4.2 ± 0.3-fold (γ-radiation) (means ± S.D. of two independent experiments) above that in FB1-treated unstimulated cells, corresponding to 97% and 93% of the responses observed in the absence of FB1, respectively. Thus, similar to what we found for CD95, Cer formation upon etoposide or γ-radiation is not the resultant of enhanced de novo Cer synthesis. This conclusion is supported by the earlier observation that these DNA-damaging stimuli induce the breakdown of exogenously supplied NBD-SM (14Tepper A.D. Ruurs P. Wiedmer T. Sims P. Borst J. van Blitterswijk W.J. J. Cell Biol. 2000; 150: 155-164Crossref PubMed Scopus (172) Google Scholar). Taken together, these data strongly suggests that the pool of Cer that accumulates during apoptosis is derived from SM hydrolysis, presumably at the plasma membrane (14Tepper A.D. Ruurs P. Wiedmer T. Sims P. Borst J. van Blitterswijk W.J. J. Cell Biol. 2000; 150: 155-164Crossref PubMed Scopus (172) Google Scholar), and that this pool is inaccessible to the GCS enzyme, which resides in the Golgi. To verify this interpretation, we examined whether overexpressed GCS convert “excess” Cer, artificially generated from plasma membrane SM by exogenous bacterial SMase. SMase treatment resulted in dramatic Cer accumulation in both J16-Zeo and J16-Zeo-GCS cells (Figs. 4(upper panels) and 5C). However, there was only a slight (but insignificant) increase in GlcCer level upon SMase treatment of GCS-overexpressing cells, indicating that this bulk amount of Cer liberated in the plasma membrane does not serve as a substrate for GCS (Fig. 5 C). Together, our results clearly demonstrate that GCS does not convert the pool of natural Cer species produced during apoptosis, most likely due to distinct subcellular localization of enzyme (Golgi) and substrate (plasma membrane). Unlike natural Cer generated in the plasma membrane, an exogenously supplied fluorescent cell-permeable Cer analog, C6-NBD-Cer, is efficiently glycosylated by GCS (Fig. 2). This indicates that such (short chain) cell-permeable Cer analogs differ from natural Cer species in its capacity to distribute to intracellular membranes. To supplement this data, we assessed whether GCS is able to glycosylate cell-permeable Cer when generated by a SMase in response to apoptotic stimulation. C6-NBD-SM was added to J16-Zeo-GCS and control cells treated with anti-CD95 antibody, and the generation of C6-NBD-Cer species was examined by TLC. In unstimulated cells, C6-NBD-SM was already converted to C6-NBD-Cer to some extent, presumably as a result of C6-NBD-SM endocytosis and accompanying hydrolysis (Fig.6 A). This pool of basal C6-NBD-Cer was further metabolized to C6-NBD-GlcCer, which occurred with enhanced efficiency in GCS-transduced cells (Fig. 6 A). CD95 stimulation enhanced C6-NBD-Cer production in a time-dependent manner in both J16-Zeo and J16-Zeo-GCS cells. However, this particular pool of endogenously produced C6-NBD-Cer did not seem to be further metabolized to C6-NBD-GlcCer. Rather, it appeared that C6-NBD-GlcCer levels decreased upon CD95 stimulation (Fig. 6 A). Since the in vivo assay had demonstrated that exogenously added C6-NBD-Cer can reach the Golgi, these results imply that GCS activity is reduced in cells undergoing apoptosis. Indeed, the conversion of C6-NBD-Cer to C6-NBD-GlcCer was strongly inhibited when C6-NBD-Cer was added exogenously to cells undergoing apoptosis induced by CD95, etoposide, or γ-radiation (Fig. 6,B and C). Treatment of cells with bacterial SMase for 2–4 h, which precedes the onset of apoptotic morphological features by at least 6 h did not inhibit GCS activity (Fig.6 C). The in vitro GCS activity was also dramatically reduced in lysates of CD95-stimulated cells (Fig.6 D), excluding the possibility that reduced C6-NBD-GlcCer formation in apoptotic cells is due a reduced accessibility of GCS. We conclude from these experiments that GCS activity is down-regulated in cells undergoing apoptosis, irrespective of the stimulus used. Although Cer accumulation in the execution phase of apoptosis was unaffected by GCS overexpression, it remained of interest to examine the apoptosis sensitivity of the GCS-overexpressing cells, since GCS might modulate rapid Cer responses, which we have not been able to detect (14Tepper A.D. Ruurs P. Wiedmer T. Sims P. Borst J. van Blitterswijk W.J. J. Cell Biol. 2000; 150: 155-164Crossref PubMed Scopus (172) Google Scholar, 22Tepper A.D. Boesen de Cock J.G. de Vries E.

Chem. 2000; 275: 15691-15700Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar). Fig.7 A shows that GCS overexpression did not protect cells against CD95-induced apoptosis (nuclear fragmentation). There was even a modest increase in sensitivity to anti-CD95 antibody, but this effect was not statistically significant. In addition, GCS overexpression did not confer resistance to the topoisomerase II inhibitor etoposide or to γ-radiation (Fig. 7 B). Since other investigators had found that, in breast cancer cells, GCS can protect against apoptosis induced by adriamycin (20Liu Y.Y. Han T.Y. Giuliano A.E. Cabot M.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 1140-1146Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (240) Google Scholar), another topoisomerase II inhibitor, we tested apoptosis sensitivity to this drug as well. In this case as well, apoptosis was comparable in GCS-transduced cells and control cells (data not shown). Since we had found that the cell-permeable Cer analog C6-NBD-Cer was efficiently glycosylated by GCS, we examined whether GCS-transduced Jurkat cells had acquired resistance to apoptosis-induction by (other) synthetic cell-permeable Cer analogs. For comparison, cells were also treated with bacterial SMase, generating natural Cer species in the plasma membrane, that were shown not to be glycosylated by GCS (Fig. 5 C). Again, no protective effect of increased GCS expression was observed (Fig.7 C). Rather, GCS-transduced cells displayed increased apoptosis sensitivity to submaximal concentrations of C2-Cer or C6-Cer. A Jurkat cell line stably overexpressing GCS was generated with the aim to attenuate Cer accumulation during the execution phase of apoptosis via its enhanced glycosylation to GlcCer. GCS-transduced cells showed increased in vivo and in vitro GCS activity. Basal GlcCer levels in these cells were approximately 7-fold higher than in empty vector-transduced control cells, as evidenced by equilibrium labeling with [14C]serine. Basal SM levels were reduced by about 30% upon GCS transduction. SM is predominantly synthesized at the lumenal side of the cis-Golgi (16Futerman A.H. Pagano R.E. Biochem. J. 1991; 280: 295-302Crossref PubMed Scopus (246) Google Scholar, 17Jeckel D. Karrenbauer A. Burger K.N.J. van Meer G. Wieland F. J. Cell Biol. 1992; 117: 259-267Crossref PubMed Scopus (259) Google Scholar), the same cellular compartment where GCS converts Cer to GlcCer, and our results strongly suggest that (overexpressed) GCS “competes” with SM synthase for Cer, their common substrate. The modest increase in basal Cer may reflect an enhanced de novo Cer biosynthesis as a mechanism to compensate for Cer utilization by GCS. In marked contrast to the effects of GCS overexpression on basal Cer/GlcCer metabolism, we found no evidence for enhanced glycosylation of Cer pool accumulating during apoptosis induced by CD95, etoposide, or γ-radiation. These findings strongly suggest that the subcellular site of Cer production during apoptosis is segregated from the site of GCS action, the cis-Golgi. This notion is in good agreement with our previous work showing that Cer accumulation in our cell system results from hydrolysis of plasma membrane SM and not from de novo synthesis (14Tepper A.D. Ruurs P. Wiedmer T. Sims P. Borst J. van Blitterswijk W.J. J. Cell Biol. 2000; 150: 155-164Crossref PubMed Scopus (172) Google Scholar). Moreover, we demonstrate here that the bulk amount of Cer released from plasma membrane SM upon bacterial SMase treatment is virtually not glycosylated by GCS. The rise in Cer upon SMase treatment was maximal after 25–30 min, and no significant increase in GlcCer formation was found up to 60 min. In contrast to our results, analysis of the metabolic fate of SMase-generated Cer in HT29 cells indicated that Cer formation (maximal after 1–2 h) was followed by GlcCer production after about 3 h (28Veldman R.J. Klappe K. Hoekstra D. Kok J.W. Biochem. J. 1998; 331: 563-569Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). Although the kinetics of Cer production by SMase were much faster in our cell system, it cannot be excluded that some Cer is metabolized to GlcCer at later time points. At any rate, GCS overexpression could not prevent the accumulation of Cer. We conclude that the Cer pool that is synthesizedde novo in the endoplasmic reticulum and transported to the Golgi by vesicular trafficking is efficiently targeted by GCS, whereas Cer generated in the plasma membrane is poorly accessible to GCS. Although SMase-liberated Cer was not glycosylated, GCS-transduced Jurkat cells could readily use membrane-inserted C6-NBD-Cer as a substrate for C6-NDB-GlcCer synthesis, indicating that this amphipathic Cer analog can reach the Golgi complex. These data illustrate that short chain Cer analogs do not exactly mimic the behavior of naturally occurring long chain Cer species. Due to their solubility in both lipidic and aqueous environments, short chain Cer analogs that have passed the plasma membrane can apparently reach other intracellular compartments. In contrast, natural Cer species, which contain two long hydrophobic aliphatic chains, strongly favor a lipid environment. The spontaneous exchange rate of long chain (C16)-Cer between phospholipid vesicles is in the order of days, and it has been concluded that, without the aid of an exchange protein, Cer can only interact with molecules located at the same membrane where Cer is formed (29Simon C.G. Holloway P.W. Gear A.R.L. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 14676-14682Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). In contrast, the exchange of C6-NBD-Cer between lipid vesicles occurs within minutes (30Pagano R.E. Martin O.C. Biochemistry. 1998; 27: 4439-4445Crossref Scopus (102) Google Scholar). Other investigators came to essentially the same conclusions, when they observed that natural Cer formed in the lysosomes cannot escape this compartment, in contrast to a fluorescent short chain Cer analog (31Chatelut M. Leruth M. Harzer K. Dagan A. Marchesini S. Gatt S. Salvayre R. Courtoy P. Levade T. FEBS Lett. 1998; 426: 102-106Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). Our study also allows the conclusion that GCS activity is inhibited when cells undergo apoptosis. In fact, Cer accumulation is paralleled by a loss of GCS activity. Our results are in agreement with data reported for Kym-1 cells undergoing TNFα-induced apoptosis, in which Cer production (a rapid response peaking after 2 min) was accompanied by decreased in vitro GCS and SM synthase activities (32Bourteele S. Hausser A. Doppler H. Horn-Muller J. Ropke C. Schwarzmann G. Pfizenmaier K. Muller G. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 31245-31251Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). However, the failure to glycosylate “excess” Cer cannot simply be explained by GCS inhibition. Cer released in the plasma membrane upon SMase treatment was not metabolized to GlcCer (Fig. 5 C), whereas GCS was still fully active under these conditions (Fig.6 C). Our results suggest that the natural Cer species accumulating during the execution phase of apoptosis are not converted by GCS to GlcCer because (i) this pool of Cer is topologically segregated from GCS and (ii) the overall GCS activity is down-regulated during apoptosis. Apoptosis sensitivity to CD95, etoposide, or γ-radiation was not altered in GCS-transduced cells. GCS overexpression also did not protect against apoptosis induced by cell-permeable C2-Cer or C6-Cer. This was unexpected, since (C6-NBD) Cer was glycosylated by GCS. We did not directly assess it, but other studies have shown that both short chain Cer species are metabolized upon addition to cells (33Ridgway N.D. Merriam D.L. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1995; 1256: 57-70Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar), similar to C6-NBD-Cer. Thus, despite their glycosylation, these Cer analogs are potent inducers of apoptosis. Paradoxically, dose-response analysis revealed that cells overexpressing GCS even have an increased sensitivity to C2-Cer and C6-Cer. We should note at this point that the mechanism of short chain Cer analog-induced apoptosis and particularly the role of GCS therein is not completely understood; Cabot et al. implicated GCS in the protection against cell killing by exogenous Cer (20Liu Y.Y. Han T.Y. Giuliano A.E. Cabot M.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 1140-1146Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (240) Google Scholar), suggesting that Cer, and not GlcCer exerts the cytotoxic effect. However, an opposite role for GCS in Cer toxicity is suggested by the work of De Maria et al. (34De Maria R. Lenti L. Malisan F. d'Agostino F. Tomassini B. Zeuner A. Rippo M.R. Testi R. Science. 1997; 277: 1652-1655Crossref PubMed Scopus (379) Google Scholar), who reported that apoptosis induction by Cer requires its conversion to GD3 ganglioside. Since the first step in the conversion of Cer to GD3 involves Cer glycosylation to GlcCer, this scenario would imply a sensitizing rather than a protective role for GCS in apoptosis. The effects of stable GCS overexpression on sphingolipid metabolism and apoptosis sensitivity we observe are markedly different from those reported by Cabot's laboratory (20Liu Y.Y. Han T.Y. Giuliano A.E. Cabot M.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 1140-1146Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (240) Google Scholar, 21Liu Y.Y. Han T.Y. Giuliano A.E. Ichikawa S. Hirabayashi Y.

Chem. 2000; 275: 7138-7143Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar). These investigators found increased GlcCer levels in cells displaying multidrug resistance. In MCF-7 breast cancer cells that overexpressed GCS, the Cer pool produced in response to adriamycin or TNFα was glycosylated and GCS conferred protection against cytotoxicity. The discrepancies between these findings and ours may be explained by different mechanisms and subcellular sites of Cer production involved. These may vary depending on the cell type and stimulus used. We have shown that only de novo generated but not SMase-derived Cer is a substrate for GCS. The mechanism by which adriamycin causes elevated Cer levels in MCF-7 cells has not been established, but if it stems from de novosynthesis, the effect of GCS can be explained. TNFα-induced Cer production in MCF-7 cells could either be SM-derived or synthesizedde novo, as it ranges from a rapid (10 min) and transient response concomitant with SM hydrolysis (36Cai Z. Bettaieb A. Mahdani N.E. Legres L.G. Stancou R. Masliah J. Chouaib S. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 6918-6926Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar) to a slow and sustained accumulation starting around 8 h after induction (37Dbaibo G.S. Perry D.K. Gamard C.J. Platt R. Poirier G.G. Obeid L.M. Hannun YA. J. Exp. Med. 1997; 185: 481-490Crossref PubMed Scopus (208) Google Scholar). Notably, the suppressive effects of GCS on Cer formation in MCF-7 cells were only seen after a very long time of exposure to adriamycin (24–48 h) or TNFα (48–72 h). Alternatively, the explanation for the opposing results data may reside in the different methods employed for either GCS overexpression (a stable polyclonal Jurkat cell populationversus inducible MCF-7 clones), lipid quantification (steady state labeled Jurkat cells versus pulse labeling of MCF-7 cells at the time of apoptosis induction) and detection of apoptosis (nuclear fragmentation versus cell survival). Taken together, the results show that overexpression of GCS in Jurkat cells leads to increased GCS activity and elevated GlcCer levels. These alterations in Cer/GlcCer metabolism have no influence on Cer accumulation associated with the execution phase of apoptosis, most likely due to the distinct subcellular site of Cer production and the GCS enzyme and the inhibition of GCS during apoptosis. Our results emphasize the compartmentalization of SM-derived Cer and Cer glycosylation and demonstrate that the attenuating effect of GCS depends on the mechanism (SMase versus de novo) and subcellular site of Cer production.

The 42-kDa ERE-BP is highly homologous to proteins in the hnRNPC subfamily (23Lahiri D.K. Thomas J.O. Nucleic Acids Res. 1986; 14: 4077-4094Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). It acts to squelch estrogen receptor (ER)-estrogen response element (ERE)-directed transactivation by competing with the ER homodimer for binding to the ERE. Although discovered because of its overexpression in estrogen-resistant New World primate species, the ERE-BP is also expressed in Old World primate species including man (21Chen H. Arbelle J.E. Gacad M.A. Allegretto E.A. Adams J.S. J. Clin. Invest. 1997; 99: 669-675Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). The vitamin D response element-binding protein or VDRE-BP described here is in the second set of non-receptor sterol/steroid hormone response element-binding protein to be discovered. VDRE-BP was also initially identified in New World primates resistant to the vitamin D pre-hormone, 25-hydroxyvitamin D, and vitamin D hormone, 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D (24Arbelle J.E. Chen H. Gacad M.A. Allegretto E.A. Pike J.W. Adams J.S. Endocrinology. 1996; 137: 786-789Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). Here we report the purification, cloning, and initial functional characterization of two VDRE-BPs as a members of the hnRNPA family. One of these VDRE-BPs, VDRE-BP2, is capable of squelching sterol/steroid hormone-mediated transactivation.DISCUSSIONOur knowledge of the rheostatic control of sterol/steroid hormone action has evolved considerably in the recent past. The earliest concepts of control focused on hormone synthesis, hormone metabolism (or catabolism), and hormone-receptor interaction in the target cell. In the vitamin D hormone system, target cell responsiveness is known to be governed by 1) the cutaneous, nonenzymatic photosynthesis of vitamin D (42Holick M.F. Fed. Proc. 1987; 46: 1876-1882PubMed Google Scholar); 2) the serial enzymatic modification of vitamin D to its active hormone, 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D (43Jones G. Strugnell S.A. DeLuca H.F. Physiol. Rev. 1998; 78: 1193-1231Crossref PubMed Scopus (1007) Google Scholar); and 3) interaction of the 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D hormone with its nuclear receptor protein, the VDR (43Jones G. Strugnell S.A. DeLuca H.F. Physiol. Rev. 1998; 78: 1193-1231Crossref PubMed Scopus (1007) Google Scholar). For example, without adequate sunlight exposure mammalian species, including Homo sapiens, fail to synthesize enough of the prohormone vitamin D to provide a sufficient supply of substrates to the vitamin d-25-hydroxylase and vitamind-1-hydroxylase enzymes required for 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D production. The resultant phenotype is failure to properly mineralize the skeleton. The same or similar skeletal phenotype is also seen in humans with inactivating mutations of the vitamind-1-hydroxylase (44Fu G.K. Lin D. Zhang M.Y. Bikle D.D. Shackleton C.H. Mol. Endocrinol. 1997; 11: 1961-1970Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 45Kitanaka S. Takeyama K. Murayama A. Sato T. Okumura K. Nogami M. Hasegawa Y. Niimi H. Yanagisawa J. Tanaka T. Kato S. N. Engl. J.

Med. 1999; 106: 355-370Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). Because they elicit the most dramatic changes in hormone effect and the most definitive phenotype, vitamin D prohormone synthesis, metabolism, and interaction of the hormone with VDR can be considered sites of “macroregulation” of vitamin D action.However, there are additional factors in the hormone action schema that produce a much less subtle change in the phenotype. These factors serve as “microregulators” to fine tune hormone responses. In the vitamin D system, such microregulators include 1) the circulating vitamin D-binding protein, the shuttle protein in the serum that serves to deliver active vitamin D metabolites to target tissues for metabolism or action and carry away inactive metabolites for catabolism and excretion (47Cooke N.E.

Another proposed microregulator in the vitamin D metabolism/action system is the newly discovered family of hsp70-related intracellular vitamin D-binding proteins. These proteins, initially identified in vitamin d-resistant New World primate cells (52Gacad M.A. Adams J.S. J. Clin. Invest. 1991; 87: 996-1001Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar, 53Gacad M.A. Chen H. Arbelle J.E. LeBon T. Adams J.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 8433-8440Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar), have a high capacity and relatively high affinity (2–20 nm) for 25-hydroxylated vitamin D metabolites (54Gacad M.A. Adams J.S. Endocrinology. 1992; 131: 2581-2587Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). Recent work 2S. Wu, unpublished data. indicates that these proteins have the ability to facilitate hormone action by delivery of 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D hormone to the nucleus and VDR, which has a higher affinity for hormone than the intracellular vitamin D-binding proteins.Although the protein-protein interactions that occur among receptor proteins and various co-regulators may provide the most complex means of control of transcription, these interactions are not the most direct mode of transcriptional regulation. For example, even if assembled for maximal transcriptional effectiveness, the transactivating complex must be able to interact with a specific promoter element in order to achieve its transcriptional potential (55Blackwood E.M. Kadonga J.T. Science. 1998; 281: 60-63Crossref PubMed Scopus (607) Google Scholar). If the VDR-RXR-directed tethering the transcriptional machinery to promoter elements via the VDRE is not possible because the cis element is occupied by another protein, then transcription will be thwarted although the complex is optimally suited to enhance transcription. The YY1 protein is one such protein with the potential to exert dominant-negative modulatory control over VDR-RXR-directed transcription through the VDRE (38Guo B. Aslam F. Wijnen A.J.V. Roberts S.G.E. Frenkel B. Green M.R. DeLuca H. Lian J.B. Stein G.S. Stein J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 121-126Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). Guoet al. (38Guo B. Aslam F. Wijnen A.J.V. Roberts S.G.E. Frenkel B. Green M.R. DeLuca H. Lian J.B. Stein G.S. Stein J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 121-126Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar) have shown that YY1 protein can compete with VDR-RXR heterodimer for occupation of the VDRE in the osteocalcin promoter. We found that neither antibodies to the YY1 protein nor exposure to a 100-fold excess of the YY1 recognition sequence altered binding of New World primate cell VDRE-BPs to either the osteocalcin or the osteopontin VDRE (Fig. 1 B). These results suggested that the VDRE-BPs in crude extracts of New World primate cells were not related to the YY1 protein family, a point later confirmed upon isolation and structural characterization of the VDRE-BPs as members of the hnRNPA family of proteins (see Figs. 3 and 6).We have not yet determined independent affinity constants of the two known VDRE-BPs for the VDRE, but preliminary results 3H. Chen, unpublished data. indicate that VDRE-BP2 possesses an avidity for the VDRE that rivals that of the VDR-RXR complex and harbors the same transcriptional squelching potential of YY1 (see Fig. 1 B). Hence, when present in relatively small quantities in the nuclear compartment compared with the VDR and RXR, we propose that VDRE-BP2 has the potential to compete with VDR-RXR dimer for binding to the VDRE. When present in relatively large quantities as they are vitamin d-resistant New World primate cells, it is possible that VDRE-BP2 can substantially limit hormone-stimulated gene expression (Fig. 2). Consequently, we theorize that depending on their relative abundance in the target cell the VDRE-BPs have the potential to function as either a microregulator (i.e. when present in relative low abundance compared with VDR-RXR) or as a macroregulator when the VDRE-BP(s) overwhelm the VDR-RXR and its access to the VDRE.hnRNPs are classically recognized as single-strand pre-mRNA-binding proteins (10Dreyfuss G. Matunis M.J. Pinol-Roma S. Burd C.G. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1993; 62: 289-321Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Recently proteins in this class have also been shown to possess the ability to bind DNA including double-strand DNA and to alter, principally by silencing, transcription (4Pinol-Roma S. Dreyfuss G. Nature. 1992; 355: 730-732Crossref PubMed Scopus (737) Google Scholar, 5Pinol-Roma S. Dreyfuss G.

The hnRNPA2-related VDRE-BP2 falls into this category. Affinity-purified VDRE-BP(s) will bind to either double-strand (Figs. 1 and 4) or single-strand (Fig. 4) DNA bearing a VDRE. The effectiveness of a single-strand oligonucleotide bearing the consensus RXRE (consisting of a direct repeat of the AGGTCA motif separated by only a single, not three, nucleotides) in competing for VDRE-BP binding suggests that the specificity for VDRE-BP binding resides in the 6-bp half-site motif (G/A)GGT(G/C)A; variations of this six-nucleotide motif encompasses nucleotide sequences present in the VDRE-op (GGGTCA), VDRE-oc (GGGTGA), and RXRE (AGGTCA) used in our DNA binding analyses. Binding specificity was confirmed by failure of the complementary (opposite) strand of the VDRE-op, VDRE-oc, and RXRE to compete for VDRE-BP binding when either single-strand or double-strand VDRE was employed as probe and by the ability of anti-hnRNPA1 antibody to disrupt VDRE-BP-VDRE binding (data not shown).We recently described an hnRNPC-like protein, which competes with the ER for binding to the ERE (21Chen H. Arbelle J.E. Gacad M.A. Allegretto E.A. Adams J.S. J. Clin. Invest. 1997; 99: 669-675Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar, 22Chen H. Hu B. Gacad M.A. Adams J.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 31352-31357Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). This protein, termed the ERE-BP, exerts a profound dominant-negative influence on ER-ERE-directed transactivation in vitro and induces estrogen resistancein vivo when overexpressed (22Chen H. Hu B. Gacad M.A. Adams J.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 31352-31357Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). The VDRE-BP2 described here appears to act in similar fashion with overexpression of this protein clearly squelching VDR-RXR-directed transactivation (Figs. 2, 5, and 7) via its ability to bind to the VDRE (Figs. 6 and 7). The question remains whether VDRE-BP2 is absolutely specific for the VDRE-BP or whether it might interact with other hormone response elements as well. To address this question, we examined the ability of VDRE-BP2, to alter transactivation directed by a ERE (Fig. 8 A). It did not. We also queried whether transient overexpression of the ERE-BP acted to squelch VDRE-directed transactivation. Although a number of separate experiments showed no substantial or consistent effect with transient overexpression of the ERE-BP (data not shown). Stable overexression of the ERE-BP in wild-type cells had no effect on VDRE-directed reporter activity while ERE-BP significantly squelched ERE-directed transactivation. These findings and the observation that squelching of VDRE-directed transactivation in cells transiently (Fig. 5) and in cell lines stably overexpressing VDRE-BP2 (Fig. 7) approximated that observed in vitamin d-resistant New World primate cells, which endogenously overexpress VDRE-BP2 and VDRE-BP1, indicates that VDRE-BP2 is the principal dominant-negative agent active at the VDRE.The fact that the hnRNPA1-related VDRE-BP1 identified here had VDRE binding potential (Fig. 3 A) but was without significant squelching potential (Fig. 5) was surprising. It is possible that the affinity of VDRE-BP1 for the VDRE is much lower, hence its ability to remain on the cis element and interfere with VDR-RXR binding is diminished compared with VDRE-BP2. The reduced but still existing affinity of VDRE-BP1 for the VDRE may also be an explanation why VDRE-directed transactivation of a reporter cell lines overexpressing VDRE-BP2 at levels observed in hormone-resistant New World primate cells was not completely squelched (Fig. 7 C). If present in sufficient quantity, as VDRE-BP1 appears to be in vitamind-resistant New World primates cells (Fig. 3 A), VDRE-BP1 may compete with VDRE-BP2 for binding to the VDRE. It is also likely that squelching of transcription requires interactions with other proteins in the transcriptional complex. As a consequence it is possible that the reason VDRE-BP1 is ineffective as regulator of transcription (Fig. 5) is because VDRE-BP1 in incapable of interacting with the transcriptional machinery, while VDRE-BP2 is capable of interacting with those proteins.Are there in vivo equivalents to the microregulatory and macroregulatory phenotypes induced by the VDRE-BP(s) among primate genera? In subhuman primates the answer is yes. The partially hormone-responsive New World primate genus Aotus and the hormone-resistant New World primate genus Callithrix (52Gacad M.A. Adams J.S. J. Clin. Invest. 1991; 87: 996-1001Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar) are respective examples of the micro- and macroregulatory phenotype. Because Aotus cells express relatively little mRNA (Fig.3 C) and even less protein for the VDRE-BPs, this genus possesses circulating 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D levels similar to those of Old World primates and a clinical phenotype that is difficult to detect even when challenged with sunlight deprivation (19Adams J.S. Gacad M.A. Baker A.J. Gonzales B. Rude R.K. Am. J. Primatol. 1985; 9: 219-224Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar, 20Gacad M.A. Deseran M.W. Adams J.S. Am. J. Primatol. 1992; 28: 263-270Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). On the other hand, Callithrix, which expresses high levels of the VDRE-BP mRNA and protein (Figs. 3 C and 6 A), possesses very high serum levels of 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D and an extreme propensity to develop rickets when cutaneous vitamin D synthesis is challenged (19Adams J.S. Gacad M.A. Baker A.J. Gonzales B. Rude R.K. Am. J. Primatol. 1985; 9: 219-224Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar, 20Gacad M.A. Deseran M.W. Adams J.S. Am. J. Primatol. 1992; 28: 263-270Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar, 52Gacad M.A. Adams J.S. J. Clin. Invest. 1991; 87: 996-1001Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). Are there human equivalents to the microregulatory and macroregulatory phenotypes caused by the VDRE-BPs in subhuman primates? Because the phenotype that would likely result from a relatively low level VDRE-BP expression is likely to be subtle or nonexistent in the basal (unchallenged) state, it is highly unlikely that we have yet identified the human counterpart of the microregulatory phenotype. However, this may not be the case with the macroregulatory phenotype as exemplified by Callithrix. There are human families described with the classical phenotype of vitamin d-resistant rickets that harbor high serum concentrations of the active vitamin D metabolite 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D but no recognized mutation in the VDR (56Hewison M.

It is possible that these subjects may suffer from a disturbance resulting in the constitutive overexpression of a protein(s) that interacts with the VDRE.3 Dominant-negative control of steroid hormone-regulated gene transcription has been traditionally attributed to: 1) expression of transcriptionally silent receptor molecules, which compete with transactivating receptor dimer pairs for binding to enhancer elements (1Tsai M.J. O'Malley B.W. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1994; 63: 451-486Crossref PubMed Scopus (2678) Google Scholar, 2Subauste J.S. Koenig R.K. Mol. Endocrinol. 1998; 12: 1380-1392Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar); and 2) expression of non-DNA-binding co-repressor molecules, which interact with other constituents of the transcriptional complex to halt or slow transcription (3Horwitz K.B. Jackson T.A. Bain D.L. Richer J.K. Takimoto G.S. Tung L. Mol. Endocrinol. 1996; 10: 1167-1177Crossref PubMed Scopus (834) Google Scholar). More recently, another family of dominant-negative-acting proteins which squelch transcription have been identified. These proteins are in the heterogeneous nuclear ribonuclear protein (hnRNP)1 superfamily (4Pinol-Roma S. Dreyfuss G. Nature. 1992; 355: 730-732Crossref PubMed Scopus (737) Google Scholar, 5Pinol-Roma S. Dreyfuss G.

Biochem. 1993; 62: 289-321Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and control the modification and movement of mRNA in the cell. The fact that hnRNPs could function as dominant-negative regulators of transcription was discovered in New World primates, a nonhuman primate suborder that is characterized phenotypically by relative target-tissue resistance to adrenal, gonadal, and vitamin D sterol/steroid hormones (11Brown G.M.

The 42-kDa ERE-BP is highly homologous to proteins in the hnRNPC subfamily (23Lahiri D.K. Thomas J.O. Nucleic Acids Res. 1986; 14: 4077-4094Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). It acts to squelch estrogen receptor (ER)-estrogen response element (ERE)-directed transactivation by competing with the ER homodimer for binding to the ERE. Although discovered because of its overexpression in estrogen-resistant New World primate species, the ERE-BP is also expressed in Old World primate species including man (21Chen H. Arbelle J.E. Gacad M.A. Allegretto E.A. Adams J.S. J. Clin. Invest. 1997; 99: 669-675Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). The vitamin D response element-binding protein or VDRE-BP described here is in the second set of non-receptor sterol/steroid hormone response element-binding protein to be discovered. VDRE-BP was also initially identified in New World primates resistant to the vitamin D pre-hormone, 25-hydroxyvitamin D, and vitamin D hormone, 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D (24Arbelle J.E. Chen H. Gacad M.A. Allegretto E.A. Pike J.W. Adams J.S. Endocrinology. 1996; 137: 786-789Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). Here we report the purification, cloning, and initial functional characterization of two VDRE-BPs as a members of the hnRNPA family. One of these VDRE-BPs, VDRE-BP2, is capable of squelching sterol/steroid hormone-mediated transactivation. DISCUSSIONOur knowledge of the rheostatic control of sterol/steroid hormone action has evolved considerably in the recent past. The earliest concepts of control focused on hormone synthesis, hormone metabolism (or catabolism), and hormone-receptor interaction in the target cell. In the vitamin D hormone system, target cell responsiveness is known to be governed by 1) the cutaneous, nonenzymatic photosynthesis of vitamin"

Chemical variations within the garnets correlate with carbon isotopes in the diamonds, indicating contemporaneous formation. Trace element, radiogenic, and stable isotope variations can be explained by the interaction of eclogites with a carbonatitic melt, derived by remobilization of material that had been stored for a considerable time in the lithosphere.

PKCδ, a member of the so-called nPKC subfamily, has attracted the interest of an increasing number of research groups over the last years and presumably is one of the most thoroughly studied PKC isoenzymes (for a review see Ref. 3Gschwendt M. Eur. J. Biochem. 1999; 259: 555-564Crossref PubMed Scopus (230) Google Scholar). Like all the other PKC isoforms, PKCδ is thought to play an individual role in various signaling pathways and to specifically affect diverse cellular processes, such as growth, differentiation, apoptosis, and tumorigenesis (4–16). This specific action is likely to afford a sophisticated network of regulation of PKCδ activity, subcellular localization, and substrate phosphorylation. Beside the well known regulation of enzyme activity by signal-induced second messengers, such as diacylglycerol, PKCδ is regulated by up- and down-modulation of its expression (4Geiges D. Marks F.

Particularly the latter is essential for a specific subcellular localization of the enzyme and a selective phosphorylation of substrate proteins. Our knowledge of PKCδ-protein interactions, however, is rather scanty. This holds true not only for the interaction with physiologically relevant substrate proteins but also for the interaction with other proteins that might affect PKCδ signaling. We therefore attempted to clone proteins interacting with PKCδ by using the yeast two-hybrid system (YTHS). Here, we describe the cloning, expression, and characterization of a novel serine/threonine kinase, termed DIK (PKC-delta-interacting protein kinase), which is coimmunoprecipitated with PKCδ and the catalytic fragment of PKCδ from cell extracts. Rat PKCδ-cDNA was generously provided by Dr. Polke (Würzburg, Germany). Peptides were synthesized by Dr. R. Pipkorn (German Cancer Research Center). Other materials were bought from the following companies: pepstatin, leupeptin, aprotinin, phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride from Roche Diagnostics GmbH; ATP and histone III-S from Sigma; [γ-32P]ATP (specific activity, 5000 Ci/mmol) from Hartmann Analytic (Braunschweig, Germany); and l-[35S]methionine (10 mCi/ml, specific activity: 1000 Ci/mmol) from Amersham Pharmacia Biotech. The bait plasmid for the two-hybrid screen contained the catalytic domain of PKCδ. Therefore, PCR was used to specifically amplify the catalytic domain of rat PKCδ cDNA (Pwo-Polymerase; Roche Diagnostics GmbH) with primers harboring EcoRI (5′) and BamHI (3′) sites. The PCR product was purified and digested withEcoRI/BamHI. Then the cDNA insert was ligated to pGBT9 (CLONTECH, Palo Alto, CA) to obtain pGBT9-rPKCδcat. The in-frame fusion to the DNA-binding domain vector was confirmed by sequencing, and the expression of the fusion protein was confirmed by immunoblotting. This bait construct did not activate the reporter genes by itself. For the two-hybrid screen, pGBT9-rPKCδcat was cotransformed with the human keratinocyte MATCHMAKER cDNA library (CLONTECH) in the yeast strain PJ69-2A. Transformants that were able to grow in medium containing 2 mm 3-amino-triazole were analyzed according to the manufacturer's instructions. True positives were further analyzed by DNA sequencing (Thermo Sequenase polymerase; Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). The lacking 5′-end of the DIK cDNA isolated in the YTHS was determined by 5′-rapid amplification of cDNA ends (Roche Diagnostics GmbH) according to the manufacturer's instructions using three nested DIK sequence-specific primers and RNA of HEK cells. The resulting DNA fragment thus obtained was cloned into pCR-XL-TOPO (Invitrogen, San Diego, CA) and sequenced giving rise to a partial cDNA clone of 272 nucleotides derived from the 5′-region of DIK. This cDNA clone was combined with the DIK cDNA clone isolated in the YTHS using a unique BsrGI restriction site within the overlapping region. The resulting full-length open reading frame (ORF) with 5′- and 3′-untranslated regions was cloned into the vector pBluescript II KS (+/−) (Stratagene, Heidelberg, Germany) and completely sequenced. For in vitrotranscription/translation the complete DIK cDNA was amplified by PCR (Pwo-Polymerase; Roche Diagnostics GmbH) with primers harboringEcoRI sites and then subcloned into pGEM3Z (Promega). To construct a GST-DIK fusion vector, the ORF of the DIK cDNA was amplified by PCR with primers harboring EcoRI sites and then subcloned into pGEX2T (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). For expression of FLAG-tagged DIK, the ORF of the DIK cDNA was subcloned into the eucaryotic expression vector pFLAG (Sigma) using PCR and primers harboring EcoRI (5′) and BglII (3′) sites, respectively. For expression of recombinant DIK in eucaryotic cell lines, the ORF of the DIK cDNA was amplified by PCR with primers harboring EcoRI sites and then subcloned into pCDNA3 (Invitrogen). To construct a His-DIK fusion vector, the ORF of DIK was amplified by PCR with primers harboring EcoRI (5′) andXhoI (3′) sites, respectively, and then subcloned into pBac-1 (Novagen, Schwalbach). For eucaryotic expression of PKCδ and the catalytic (PKCδcat) and regulatory (PKCδreg) domain of PKCδ, the cDNAs of PKCδ, PKCδcat, and PKCδreg were amplified using PCR and primers harboring EcoRI (5′) and BamHI (3′) or XhOI (3′) sites and then cloned into the eucaryotic expression vector pCDNA3 (Invitrogen). The nucleotide sequences of all constructs were confirmed by sequencing, and the expression of recombinant proteins was confirmed by immunoblotting. Cells were washed in sterile phosphate-buffered saline, lysed in the presence of RNAClean (Hybaid-AGS, Heidelberg, Germany), and extracted with chloroform. Total RNA was treated with 10 units of RNase-free DNase 1 (Roche Diagnostics GmbH)/μg RNA. One μg of total RNA was reverse-transcribed into cDNA using MuLV Reverse Transcriptase (PerkinElmer Life Sciences) and oligo(dT) primers. PCR was performed on a 110 aliquot of the reverse transcription mixture for 35 cycles at 94 °C for 30 s, 60 °C for 30 s, and 72 °C for 4 min using Taq DNA polymerase (Appligene Oncor, Heidelberg, Germany). The nucleotide sequences of PCR products were confirmed by sequencing. Negative control PCR reactions were run with RNA that was not treated with reverse transcriptase. Cells were homogenized in buffer A (10 mm Tris/HCl, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 0.5% Nonidet P-40, 1 μg·ml−1each of pepstatin, leupeptin, aprotinin, 1 mmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride), sonicated using a Branson sonifier, and centrifuged at 100,000 × g for 30 min at 4 °C. Plasmid pGEM3Z-DIK was analyzed for in vitro transcription/translation by using the TNT-coupled reticulocyte lysate system (Promega). Plasmid DNA (1 μg) was incubated with a rabbit reticulocyte lysate for 1 h at 30 °C in the presence of T7 RNA polymerase and 40 μCi of [35S]methionine. The reaction was terminated by addition of SDS sample buffer, and aliquots were analyzed by SDS-PAGE. Gels were dried, and the products were visualized by autoradiography. Bacterial expression was performed as described previously (39Stempka L. Girod A. Müller H.-J. Rincke G. Marks F. Gschwendt M. Bossemeyer D. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 6805-6811Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar). Bacteria were lysed in ice-cold buffer B (20 mm Tris/HCl, pH 7.5, 5 mm EGTA, 2 mm EDTA, 1% Triton X-100, 1 μg/ml each of pepstatin, leupeptin, aprotinin, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride), sonicated using a Branson sonifier, and centrifuged at 80,000 ×g for 45 min at 4 °C. HEK cells were cultured in Eagle's minimum essential medium (Bio Whittaker Europe, Verniers, Belgium) supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum, 100 units/ml penicillin, 100 μg/ml streptomycin, and 2 mml-glutamine. The cells were transiently transfected with 10 μg of expression plasmid (in coexpression studies 10 μg of each plasmid were used) by calcium phosphate precipitation according to the manufacturer's instructions (Stratagene). Cells were supplemented with fresh medium 16 h after transfection and analyzed for expression of the recombinant proteins 2 days later. Spodoptera frugiperda cells (Sf158) were grown at 27 °C as monolayer cultures in Sf900 SFM medium (Life Technologies, Inc.) supplemented with 10% heat-inactivated fetal calf serum, 50 units/ml penicillin, 50 μg/ml streptomycin, and 125 μg/1iter amphotericin B. Recombinant baculovirus was generated by cotransfecting pBac-DIK and Bac-Vector-3000 Triple Cut virus DNA (Bac vector transfection kit; Novagen, Schwalbach) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Expression of His-DIK was monitored by SDS-PAGE and immunoblotting. Cells were extracted in buffer C (50 mmNa3PO4 × 12 H2O, pH 8.0, 150 mm NaCl, 10% glycerol, 1% Triton X-100, 1 tablet of EDTA-free protease inhibitor mixture “complete” (Roche Diagnostics GmbH)) containing 5 mm imidazole as described before (see “Preparation of Cell Extracts”). His-DIK was purified from cell extracts by affinity chromatography on nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid agarose (Qiagen) according to the manufacturer's protocol. Upon washing the agarose with buffer C, His-DIK was eluted with 50–500 mm imidazole in buffer C. The fraction eluted with 200 mm imidazole was used for the kinase assays and stored at −70 °C. Immunoblotting was performed as described previously (40Zang R. Müller H.-J. Kielbassa K. Marks F. Gschwendt M. Biochem. J. 1994; 304: 641-647Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). DIK was detected by a polyclonal rabbit antiserum that was raised against the peptide AHINLQSLKFQGGHGPAATLL (amino acids 759–779 of DIK) coupled to keyhole limpet hemocyanine (Eurogentec, Seraing, Belgium). Preimmune serum was prepared from the blood of rabbits prior to their treatment with the antigen. The anti-DIK antibody was not suitable for immunoprecipitation of DIK. For detection and immunoprecipitation of FLAG-DIK a monoclonal anti-FLAG antibody (Sigma) was used. PKCδ and PKCδcatwere immunoprecipitated, and PKCδcat was also detected by a polyclonal anti-PKCδ antibody (C17; Santa Cruz) recognizing the C terminus of PKCδ. For the detection of PKCδ a monoclonal anti-PKCδ antibody (Dianova, Hamburg, Germany) was used that recognizes the N terminus of PKCδ. As secondary antibodies alkaline phosphatase-conjugated or horse-radish-peroxidase-conjugated goat anti-rabbit antibodies were used (Dianova). Cells in 100-mm dishes were lysed with 600 μl of ice-cold buffer D (20 mm Tris/HCl, pH 7.5, 2 mm EDTA, 5 mm EGTA, 0.2% Triton X-100, 150 mm NaCl, 5% glycerol, 1 μg/ml each of pepstatin, leupeptin, aprotinin, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride), sonicated using a Branson sonifier, and centrifuged at 100,000 ×g for 30 min at 4 °C. The protein concentration of the supernatant was determined with protein-dye reagent concentrate from Bio-Rad, using bovine serum albumin as standard. The lysate (800 μg of protein) was incubated at 4 °C for 2 h under gentle shaking with 10 μg of anti-FLAG antibody or 2 μg of anti-PKCδ antibody and for another 12 h with 20 μl of protein G- or protein A-Sepharose beads (Roche Diagnostics GmbH), respectively. Upon washing the Sepharose beads four times with 500 μl of ice-cold buffer E (20 mm Tris/HCl, pH 7.5, 2 mm EDTA, 5 mm EGTA, 150 mm NaCl, 5% glycerol), the immunoprecipitated proteins were dissolved by boiling the beads for 5 min in 90 μl of SDS sample buffer and subsequently separated by SDS-PAGE. Autophosphorylation of His-DIK was carried out in a total volume of 100 μl containing buffer F (10 mm Tris/HCl, pH 7.2, 10 mm MgCl2, 3 mm MnCl2), 37 μm ATP containing 20 μCi of [γ-32P]ATP, and 15 μl of the purified kinase. After incubation at 30 °C for 30 min, the reaction was terminated by addition of 10% trichloroacetic acid. Precipitated proteins were redissolved in SDS sample buffer, separated by SDS-PAGE, and visualized by autoradiography. Autophosphorylation of His-PKCδ was performed essentially as that of His-DIK. However, the assay contained in a total volume of 100 μl of buffer G (20 mmTris/HCl, pH 7.5, 20 mm β-mercaptoethanol), 4 mm MgCl2, 10 μg of phosphatidylserine, 100 nm 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate, and 37 μm ATP containing 10 μCi of [32P]ATP. Substrate phosphorylation was carried out essentially as described for autophosphorylation. However, 5 μg of a substrate protein were added to the assay mixture. The analysis was essentially performed as described by Boyle et al. (41Boyle W. Geer v. d. P. Hunter T. Methods Enzymol. 1991; 201: 110-149Crossref PubMed Scopus (1276) Google Scholar). Briefly, purified DIK (0.6 μg) was autophosphorylated, precipitated, and washed with 10% trichloroacetic acid, and hydrolyzed with 75 μl of 6n HCl at 110 °C for 2 h. The sample was dried by lyophilization in a Speed-Vac, resuspended in 20 μl of deionized water containing 0.6 mg/ml each of the phosphoamino acid markers phosphoserine, phosphothreonine, and phosphotyrosine. Upon loading 7 μl of the sample on a TLC plate, the sample was separated by two-dimensional electrophoresis. For the first dimension, we used formic acid/glacial acetic acid/water (22.5:78:899.5; pH 1.9), 1.5 kV for 60 min. For the second dimension, we used glacial acetic acid/pyridine/water (52:5:94.3; 0.1 m EDTA; pH 3.5), 1.3 kV for 30 min. 32P-Labeled phosphoamino acids were visualized by autoradiography, and the phosphoamino acid markers were visualized by treatment with ninhydrin. Searching of the EMBO data base with the software program BLASTN using the DIK cDNA sequence resulted in the identification of the dik gene on the human BAC cloneAP001743 (approximately 219 kilobases). This clone has been mapped by the Human Genome Consortium to chromosome 21q22.3. The gene locus encompasses bp 180529–152939 of the BAC clone on the antisense strand. The exon-intron boundaries of this gene were determined by comparison with the cDNA using the DNA analysis program SIMILARITY. Preliminary promoter characterization was performed on 600 bp of DNA sequence upstream of the initiation codon using the TRANSFAC data base (42Wingender E. Kel A.E. Karas H. Heinemeyer T. Dietze P. Knuppel R. Romaschenko A.G. Kolchanov N.A. Nucleic Acids Res. 1997; 25: 265-268Crossref PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar). The catalytic domain (amino acids 326–673) of rat PKCδ cDNA was used as a bait in the YTHS to screen a cDNA library from the human keratinocyte cell line HaCaT. Clones were selected and tested using standard procedures. The deduced amino acid sequence of three identical cDNA clones exhibited several domains characteristic for protein kinases. Based on these and other data (see below) the encoded protein of these clones was termed DIK. The DIK clones lacked the 5′-end. To obtain the full-length ORF, the cDNA was extended by 5′-rapid amplification of cDNA ends. The nucleotide sequence of the full-length DIK cDNA (3879 bp) and the deduced amino acid sequence of DIK (784 amino acids) are shown in Fig.1. The ORF contains 2352 bp beginning with an initiation codon at position 49 and ending with a TAG stop codon at nucleotide 2401. An in-frame stop codon is located 12 bp 5′ of the initiation codon. There are no other candidate initiation codons between this stop codon and the ATG at position 49, which suggests that this ATG codon is the true translation starting site. The ORF is flanked by a 5′-untranslated region (48 nucleotides) and a 3′-untranslated region (1573 nucleotides). A potential polyadenylation signal (AATAAA) is located at position 3838. The predicted 784-amino acid polypeptide has a calculated molecular mass of 86 kDa. As indicated in Fig. 1(A and B), it contains 12 subdomains in the N-terminal region (amino acids 22–276) that, according to Hanks and Quinn (43Hanks S.K. Quinn A.M. Methods Enzymol. 1991; 200: 38-62Crossref PubMed Scopus (1082) Google Scholar), are highly conserved in all protein kinases. They include an ATP binding site (GXGX 2GXVX 14K) in subdomain I and II, the catalytic loop region DLKPAN in subdomain VIB, and the highly conserved DFG triplet in subdomain VII. The sequence of the catalytic loop region, particularly the conserved lysine, points to DIK as a serine/threonine kinase (43Hanks S.K. Quinn A.M. Methods Enzymol. 1991; 200: 38-62Crossref PubMed Scopus (1082) Google Scholar). Based on these structural characteristics alone, however, the possibility cannot be excluded that DIK is a dual specificity protein kinase. Outside the catalytic domain, DIK exhibits 10 ankyrin-like repeats (amino acids 438–768) and the potential nuclear localization signal RRX 10RR (amino acids 469–482; Fig. 1,A and B), the latter indicating that DIK might be localized in the nucleus. Ankyrin-like repeats are thought to play a role in protein/protein interactions (44Sedgwick S.G. Smerdon S.J. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1999; 24: 311-316Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (663) Google Scholar). When looking for homologies of DIK with other proteins, predominantly protein kinases and proteins with ankyrin-like repeats were found. DAP, another protein kinase containing ankyrin-like repeats (45Raveh T. Berissi H. Eisenstein M. Spivak T. Kimchi A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 97: 1572-1577Crossref Scopus (68) Google Scholar), showed the highest sequence similarity (49%) with DIK. Unlike DAP, however, DIK contains neither a death domain nor a calmodulin-binding domain. Expression of DIK mRNA was observed in various human cell lines, as determined by reverse transcription-PCR (Fig.2). DIK mRNA could not be detected in the murine cell line MSCP5, possibly because of poorly fitting primers that were based on the human sequence of DIK. In accordance with the expression of DIK mRNA, expression of DIK protein could be demonstrated in various cell extracts by immunoblotting (Fig.3). An anti-DIK antibody was applied that had been raised in rabbits against a peptide with the amino acid sequence corresponding to amino acids 759–779 of DIK.Figure 3Detection of DIK in various cell extracts by immunoblotting. 2 × 106 cells were lysed in 500 μl of sample buffer, and 100 μl were applied to SDS-PAGE. DIK was detected by immunoblotting using polyclonal anti-DIK antibody. The HEK control was performed using a preimmune serum.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) While this paper was in preparation, the complete sequence of the human chromosome 21q became available (46Hattori M. Fujiyama A. Taylor T.D. Watanabe H. Yada T. Park H.S. et al.Nature. 2000; 405: 311-319Crossref PubMed Scopus (938) Google Scholar). According to these data (EMBL sequence data bank accession number AP001743), the dik gene is located on chromosome 21q22.3. The dik gene is around 27.7 kilobases in size and possesses 8 exons and 7 introns (Fig.1 C). Analysis of the region approximately 600 bp upstream of the initiation codon showed no putative tataaa box sequence. However, about 100 bp upstream of the start codon is a highly GC-rich region containing two consensus sp1 sites, perhaps indicative of a non-tataaa box containing promoter region. In vitro transcription/translation of the DIK cDNA in a rabbit reticulocyte lysate system resulted in the synthesis of several forms of the DIK protein with apparent molecular masses ranging from around 95 to 106 kDa, as demonstrated by SDS-PAGE and autoradiography of the 35S-labeled proteins (Fig.4 A). These proteins were not synthesized in the vector control. The appearance of various protein forms might indicate that DIK is post-translationally modified and that different stages of modification may be observed in this in vitro system. Additional studies (see below, Fig. 4,B–D) supported this assumption. However, a partially incomplete transcription/translation and/or degradation of the DIK protein cannot be excluded. A GST-DIK fusion protein was expressed in bacteria and identified in a bacterial extract upon PAGE by immunoblotting using GST and DIK antibodies (Fig. 4 B). In contrast to the heterogeneous appearance of the in vitro synthesized protein, just one homogeneous protein band of GST-DIK was observed in the bacterial extract. The vector control did not contain this protein band. In good agreement with the calculated value of 86 kDa, the relative molecular mass of bacterially expressed GST-DIK was 110 kDa, i.e. 85 kDa plus 25 kDa because of the GST tag. Thus, as could be expected, DIK was synthesized in bacteria in a form that we assume to be the unmodified form. Upon transfection of HEK cells (or COS-7 cells, not shown) with the constructs pCDNA/DIK or pFLAG/DIK, in addition to endogenous DIK, tag-less DIK or FLAG-DIK were expressed in these cells, as shown in Fig. 4 C. Endogenous DIK (see particularly the vector controls, pCDNA and pFLAG, and compare also the expression of endogenous DIK in other cells, as shown in Fig. 3), as well as tag-less DIK had an apparent molecular mass of 106 kDa. FLAG-DIK exhibited a somewhat larger molecular mass because of the tag (around 2 kDa). The 106-kDa form was likely to represent the final stage of the diverse modified forms of DIK that were observed in the in vitrotranscription/translation system (see Fig. 4 A). This assumption was strongly supported by the fact that also in baculovirus-infected insect cells DIK is expressed exclusively as a 106-kDa protein (see below, Fig. 4 D). In addition to this completely modified form, putatively partially modified forms of DIK and FLAG-DIK with lower molecular masses (95 and 97 kDa, respectively), similar to those observed in the in vitro system, were expressed in the transiently transfected cells (Fig. 4 C). Upon transfection of the cells with the tag-less DIK construct, the lower molecular mass form of DIK was even the predominant form. An answer to the question of whether this is a partially modified protein and whether DIK is indeed post-translationally modified has to await further studies. For the production of larger amounts of the 106 kDa DIK protein that presumably was completely modified and thus could be expected to be enzymatically active the baculovirus-infected insect cell system was chosen, because bacteria had been found unable to express DIK in this form. A His-tagged DIK protein, with six histidine residues at the C terminus, was efficiently expressed in these cells, as shown in Fig.4 D (left panel). The apparent molecular mass of around 106 kDa (the molecular mass is not increased significantly by the short His tag) indicated that, like endogenous DIK in HEK, COS, and other cells, His-DIK was present in the infected insect cells predominantly as the completely modified protein. His-DIK was purified by metal chelate affinity chromatography on nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid-agarose (Fig. 4 D, right panel). Upon extensive washing, His-DIK was eluted from the agarose with 50–500 mm imidazole. The fraction eluted with 200 mm imidazole was used for the kinase assays. As mentioned above, DIK contains in its N-terminal domain all characteristic subdomains that, according to Hanks and Quinn (43Hanks S.K. Quinn A.M. Methods Enzymol. 1991; 200: 38-62Crossref PubMed Scopus (1082) Google Scholar), are conserved in protein kinases. Therefore, it was of major interest to demonstrate that DIK indeed exhibited kinase activity. Recombinant His-DIK purified from baculovirus-infected insect cells (see above) was used for the kinase assays. In the presence of [32P]ATP His-DIK was able to autophosphorylate, as shown in Fig. 5 A (lane 3and 4). Upon PAGE and autoradiography, incorporation of labeled phosphate into His-DIK was clearly visible. No phosphorylation of His-DIK was observed in a control sample that had been prepared from an extract of uninfected cells according to the purification procedure of His-DIK (Fig. 5 B, left lane). In the presence of 1 μm staurosporine, that is known to inhibit many protein kinases including PKCs (47Gschwendt M. Kittstein W. Marks F. FEBS Lett. 1994; 338: 85-88Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar), autophosphorylation of His-DIK was not suppressed, whereas autophosphorylation of His-PKCδ was almost completely abolished (Fig. 5 A). Thus, staurosporine may become a valuable tool for differentiating DIK kinase activity from that of other protein kinases, particularly PKCs. According to a phosphoamino acid analysis (Fig. 6), autophosphorylation was predominantly on serine and, to some extent, on threonine but not on tyrosine residues.Figure 6Phosphoamino acid analysis of autophosphorylated DIK. Purified His-DIK was autophosphorylated, and the phosphoamino acid analysis was performed as described under “Experimental Procedures.” The sample was hydrolyzed, markers were added, and the phosphoamino acids were separated by two-dimensional electrophoresis. 32P-Labeled phosphoamino acids were visualized by autoradiography. The locations of the phosphoamino acid markers phosphoserine (P-ser), phosphothreonine (P-thr), and phosphotyrosine (P-tyr) that had been visualized by treatment with ninhydrin are indicated byarrows.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) In addition to its autophosphorylation capacity, His-DIK was able to phosphorylate substrate proteins, such as histone. Incubation of purified His-DIK with histone III-S in the presence of [32P]ATP resulted in an efficient incorporation of phosphate into the histone (Fig. 5 B). When using the control sample from uninfected cells instead of His-DIK, phosphorylation of histone was lacking. This indicated that the substrate phosphorylation was indeed due to His-DIK. Several other proteins served as substrates for His-DIK, such as aldolase and myelin basic protein (data not shown). Similar to the autophosphorylation (Fig. 6), the substrate proteins histone III-S and myelin basic protein were phosphorylated by DIK exclusively on serine and threonine residues (data not shown). These results clearly show that DIK is a serine/threonine kinase, being in accordance with the amino acid sequences of the kinase subdomains that contain motifs characteristic for serine/threonine kinases (see above). As yet we have not successfully phosphorylated PKCδ with His-DIK. Similarly, we have not been able so far to unequivocally demonstrate phosphorylation of His-DIK by PKCδ. A major problem is the autophosphorylation of His-DIK that cannot be easily differentiated from a putative phosphorylation of His-DIK by PKCδ. Therefore, it has to be considered that the interaction of both protein kinases might not be due to an enzyme-substrate relationship but might rather have another function, for instance participation of both proteins in a signaling complex. These results prove that DIK is a protein kinase able to autophosphorylate and phosphorylate various proteins in vitro. Bacterially expressed GST-DIK did not exhibit any protein kinase activity (data not shown). DIK is synthesized in bacteria in a form that is probably unmodified, as shown above (Fig. 4 B). Thus, it is likely that the modification observed upon synthesis of DIK in eucaryotic cells is required for the catalytic competence of the kinase. DIK had been cloned using the YTHS with the cDNA of PKCδcat as bait and thus could be assumed to interact with this domain of PKCδ. To prove this interaction, HEK cells were transiently cotransfected with FLAG-DIK and PKCδcat or PKCδ expression constructs. Extracts of the transfected cells expressing FLAG-tagged DIK and PKCδcator PKCδ were used for immunoprecipitation either applying an anti-FLAG (Fig. 7, A,B, and E) or an anti-PKCδ antibody (Fig. 7,C and D). The immunoblots of these immunoprecipitates clearly demonstrated coimmunoprecipitation of PKCδcat (Fig. 7 A) and PKCδ (Fig.7 E) with FLAG-DIK as well as of FLAG-DIK with PKCδcat (Fig. 7 C), thus unequivocally indicating an interaction of DIK with PKCδ and PKCδcat. The intensities of the PKCδcat and PKCδ bands in Fig. 7(A and E), respectively, appear to indicate that DIK interacts better with the catalytic domain of PKCδ than with the holoenzyme. Panels B and D of Fig. 7 serve as controls proving that FLAG-DIK and PKCδcat are indeed immunoprecipitated with the FLAG and PKCδ antibody, respectively. No unspecific precipitation of PKCδ, PKCδcat, and FLAG-DIK was observed with extracts from cells transfected with the empty vectors (pFLAG and pCDNA). Intriguingly, in the YTHS interaction of DIK with the catalytic domain of PKCδ only and not with its regulatory domain (PKCδreg) was observed (data not shown). The specificity of the interaction of DIK with the catalytic domain of PKCδ was confirmed by the coimmunoprecipitation assay. Upon transfection of HEK cells with FLAG-DIK and PKCδregexpression constructs, no coimmunoprecipitation of either FLAG-DIK with PKCδreg or PKCδreg with FLAG-DIK could be demonstrated (data not shown). The immunoprecipitation assay was performed essentially as described in Fig. 7, except that an anti-PKCδ antibody (P36520; Transduction Laboratories) was used that recognizes the N terminus of PKCδ. Taken together, we cloned a novel protein kinase, termed DIK, that contains a catalytic kinase domain and a putative regulatory domain with ankyrin-like repeats and a nuclear localization signal and that associates with PKCδ in vivo. The role of this protein kinase in signal transduction and its association with PKCδ is not yet clear and awaits further investigation, for example studies with DIK mutants (e.g. kinase negative and ankyrin repeat deletion mutants) and searching for other DIK interacting proteins, particularly physiologically relevant substrates.

We investigated the mechanisms used by human SMCs to efficiently migrate on type I collagen, following stimulation with fibroblast growth factor-2 (FGF-2). FGF-2-stimulated migration was inhibited by a hydroxamic acid inhibitor of matrix metalloproteinases and by a neutralizing anti-collagenase-1 antibody. Moreover, migration speed of SMCs plated on mutant collagenase-resistant type I collagen was not increased by FGF-2. Time-lapse video analysis of unstimulated SMCs migrating on collagen revealed discrete phases of leading edge membrane extension and rear retraction, the latter often after rupture of an elongated tail. FGF-2 stimulation yielded a more synchronous, gliding motion with a collagenase-1-mediated decrease in tail ripping. Surface labeling of SMCs with biotin followed by immunoprecipitation revealed that a proportion of active collagenase-1, expressed in response to FGF-2, was bound to the plasma membrane. Pericellular collagen substrate cleavage was verified by immunostaining for neoepitopes generated by collagenase-1 action and was localized to discrete zones beneath the cell tail and the leading edge.

Nature. 1993; 362: 801-809Crossref PubMed Scopus (10004) Google Scholar). In response to signals within the diseased vessel wall, SMCs translocate from the arterial media to the intima, or from one region in the intima to another, where they accumulate and elaborate extracellular matrix (ECM). These processes can lead to narrowing of the vascular lumen and organ ischemia. In order to migrate in the vessel wall, SMCs must contend with the dense ECM. There is good evidence that SMC migration and vascular lesion formation are accompanied by expression of ECM-degrading enzymes, including matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs, matrixins) (2Nikkari S.T.

Furthermore, SMC migration in the artery wall has been inhibited by infusion of a broad spectrum MMP inhibitor (5Bendeck M.P. Irvin C. Reidy M.A. Circ. Res. 1996; 78: 38-43Crossref PubMed Scopus (281) Google Scholar) and delivery of tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinase-2 (7Cheng L. Mantile G. Pauly R. Nater C. Felici A. Monticone R. Bilato C.

These data thus support a role for ECM proteolysis in SMC translocation, although it is not yet established which ECM components need to be degraded. Fibrillar type I collagen is a dominant ECM protein of both the normal and diseased artery wall (8Barnes M.J. Collagen Relat.

Cardiol. 1996; 78: 633-637Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). Unlike many ECM constituents, type I collagen is susceptible to degradation by only a few enzymes. Of these, collagenase-1 (MMP-1), which has been detected in human atherosclerotic lesions (2Nikkari S.T. O'Brien K.D. Ferguson M. Hatsukami T. Welgus H.G. Alpers C.E. Clowes A.W.

Collagenase-1 degrades type I collagen by cleaving a single site in the triple helical domain to yield a 3/4 N-terminal fragment and 1/4 C-terminal fragment. At physiologic temperature these fragments denature into gelatin. The extent to which this cascade is required for vascular SMC motility is unknown. However, there are at least two potential reasons why collagenase-1 action might facilitate movement of SMCs through the arterial wall. First, degradation of type I collagen may remove structural barriers to movement. Second, collagenase-1-mediated conversion of collagen to gelatin may yield a substrate that is more permissive to motility, as suggested by studies of keratinocytes (13Pilcher B.K. Dumin J.A. Sudbeck B.D. Krane S.M. Welgus H.G. Parks W.C. J. Cell Biol. 1997; 137: 1445-1457Crossref PubMed Scopus (498) Google Scholar). Basic fibroblast growth factor (called FGF-2) is a documented mediator of vascular lesion formation (14Lindner V. Reidy M.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 3739-3743Crossref PubMed Scopus (599) Google Scholar). It is one of few growth factors shown to stimulate SMC migration both in vitro and in vivo (15Bilato C. Pauly R.R. Melillo G. Monticone R. Gorelick-Feldman D. Gluzband Y.A. Sollott S.J. Ziman B. Lakatta E.G. Crow M.T. J. Clin. Invest. 1995; 96: 1905-1915Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar, 16Pickering J.G. Uniyal S.

Pathol. 1993; 143: 1024-1031PubMed Google Scholar). As well, FGF-2 can potentiate directed migration to platelet-derived growth factor-BB (PDGF-BB), another important mediator of vascular growth and repair (16Pickering J.G. Uniyal S. Ford C. Chau T. Laurin M.A. Chow L.H. Ellis C.G. Fish J. Chan B.M.C. Circ. Res. 1997; 80: 627-637Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar, 18Ferns G.A.A. Raines E.W. Sprugel K. Motani A.S. Reidy M.A. Ross R. Science. 1991; 253: 1129-1132Crossref PubMed Scopus (947) Google Scholar). Importantly, the extent to which FGF-2 stimulates SMC migration varies depending on the ECM substrate. We observed that for cells on fibronectin the effect was modest. However, on type I collagen FGF-2 almost doubled SMC migration speed (16Pickering J.G. Uniyal S. Ford C. Chau T. Laurin M.A. Chow L.H. Ellis C.G. Fish J. Chan B.M.C. Circ. Res. 1997; 80: 627-637Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). This enhanced SMC migration on type I collagen was dependent on α2β1 integrin, expression of which was also increased by FGF-2. Thus, an interplay between FGF-2, the vascular SMC, and type I collagen appears to regulate SMC motility. In this context, it is noteworthy that FGF-2 is also one of few growth factors that can induce the expression of collagenase-1 by vascular SMCs (19Pickering J.G. Ford C.M. Tang B. Chow L.H. Arterioscler. Thromb. Vasc. Biol. 1997; 17: 475-482Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). At the single cell level, migration involves a coordinated but asymmetric pattern of movement. Cell translocation is initiated by a leading front of lamellipodial and/or filopodial extensions, some of which stably attach to the ECM substrate. Traction forces generated by myosin-based contraction then advance the cell body. Release of the rear of the cell from the substrate then completes the cycle and enables forward translocation. In cells with relatively high migration speeds, these phases are smoothly coordinated such that the cells assume a gliding motion. In slower moving cells, such as fibroblasts and SMCs, the phases of movement are more discontinuous, notably because the kinetics of rear release are slower than those of forward extension. In these cell types, as the cell front protrudes the cell rear elongates and forms a tail, which is under increasing tension until ultimately it releases from the substrate and retracts into the cell body (20Chen W.T. J. Cell Biol. 1981; 90: 187-200Crossref PubMed Scopus (198) Google Scholar). Tail release from the substrate can thus be rate-limiting for cell migration. The mechanisms that regulate rear release are unclear, but two general modes have been described. The first mode involves a reduction in the strength with which the cell rear attaches to the substrate. This feature has been documented in relatively fast moving cells. In neutrophils migrating on vitronectin, for example, there is a selective reduction in affinity of adhesion between αvβ3 integrin and the ECM at the rear of the cell, with subsequent shuttling of αvβ3 integrins to the front (21Lawson M.A. Maxfield F.R. Nature. 1995; 377: 75-79Crossref PubMed Scopus (479) Google Scholar). The second mode of rear release involves rupturing of components of the adherent cell tail. This process has been identified in slower moving cells, in particular fibroblasts, where a persistently high strength of substrate adhesion at the cell rear delays the completion of the migration cycle. In this circumstance, ripping of β1integrin microaggregates at the cell rear can occur, leaving a proportion of integrins on the substrate (22Regen C.M. Horwitz A.F. J. Cell Biol. 1992; 119: 1347-1359Crossref PubMed Scopus (180) Google Scholar, 23Palecek S.P. Schmidt C.E. Lauffenburger D.A. Horwitz A.F. J. Cell Sci. 1996; 109: 941-952PubMed Google Scholar). Other studies have documented ripping of the plasma membrane itself, such that membrane-bound remnants of the tail, visible by light microscopy, are left behind (20Chen W.T. J. Cell Biol. 1981; 90: 187-200Crossref PubMed Scopus (198) Google Scholar). In this study, we investigated the mechanisms used by human vascular SMCs to migrate on type I collagen under basal conditions, where migration is relatively slow, and following stimulation with FGF-2, in which migration speed is substantially faster. We found that chemical MMP inhibitors and a neutralizing anti-collagenase-1 antibody abrogated FGF-2-stimulated migration on type I collagen, and that SMCs plated on mutant collagenase-resistant type I collagen did not accelerate their migration speed in response to FGF-2. Using digital time-lapse video analysis, we established that ripping of elongated tails, which was prominent under basal conditions, was replaced by smoother, collagenase-1-dependent retraction of shorter tails, following FGF-2 stimulation. Furthermore, we established that a proportion of active collagenase-1 expressed in response to FGF-2 was bound to the surface of plasma membrane, and that collagen substrate cleavage by FGF-2-treated SMCs was spatially localized to a zone beneath the rear of the cell. These results identify a novel mechanism by which SMC migration on collagen is enhanced, whereby rear release from the substrate is orchestrated by the localized actions of membrane-bound collagenase-1. Primary cultures of human vascular SMCs were established by explant outgrowth of unused segments of internal thoracic artery retrieved at the time of coronary artery bypass surgery (24Pickering J.G. Weir L. Rosenfield K. Stetz J. Jekanowski J. Isner J.M. J. Am. Coll. Cardiol. 1992; 20: 1430-1439Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar, 25Pickering J.G. Bacha P. Weir L. Jekanowski J. Nichols J.C. Isner J.M. J. Clin. Invest. 1993; 91: 724-729Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). The identity of SMCs was confirmed morphologically and by positive immunostaining with a monoclonal antibody (mAb) against human smooth muscle α-actin (SM α-actin, 1A4, Dako). Cells were used between the 6th and 12th passage. The HITB5 human SMC line, also derived from internal thoracic artery, was also employed (26Li S. Sims S. Jiao Y. Chow L.H. Pickering J.G. Circ. Res. 1999; 85: 338-348Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar). Cells were grown in M199 supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum and antibiotics. Chemotaxis of SMCs was measured using a microchemotaxis chamber, as described previously (16Pickering J.G. Uniyal S. Ford C. Chau T. Laurin M.A. Chow L.H. Ellis C.G. Fish J. Chan B.M.C. Circ. Res. 1997; 80: 627-637Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). Briefly, SMCs were liberated with trypsin-EDTA, and 12,500 cells in M199 with 1% bovine serum albumin were added to the upper wells of the chamber. The lower wells were filled with M199 containing 1% bovine serum albumin with or without PDGF-BB. The upper and lower wells were separated by a porous (10-μm pore size) polycarbonate membrane precoated with 100 μg/ml bovine monomeric type I collagen (Vitrogen, Collagen Corp.). The chamber was incubated for 6 h at 37 °C in 5% CO2, after which cells remaining on the upper surface of the membrane were mechanically removed. The membranes were fixed in methanol, stained with Harris's hematoxylin, and the number of cells that had migrated to the lower surface counted under high power (×40 objective) microscopy. The use of trypsin-EDTA to liberate cells for the chemotaxis assay was not found to compromise SMC migration, compared with cells liberated using EDTA alone (data not shown). All experimental conditions were studied in quadruplicate. Migration speed of SMCs was determined by digital time-lapse video microscopy, as described previously (16Pickering J.G. Uniyal S. Ford C. Chau T. Laurin M.A. Chow L.H. Ellis C.G. Fish J. Chan B.M.C. Circ. Res. 1997; 80: 627-637Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar, 27Rocnik E.F. Chan B.M. Pickering J.G. J. Clin. Invest. 1998; 101: 1889-1898Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar). Cells were plated on culture dishes precoated with 100 μg/ml type I collagen and positioned on the stage of an inverted microscope (Axiovert S100, Zeiss). Cells were incubated in M199 with Hanks' salts and 25 mmol/liter HEPES to maintain physiological pH in room air. Ambient temperature was maintained at 37 °C using a temperature control cell (BC-100, 20/20 Technology, Inc.), and evaporation/condensation was prevented by applying a stream of humidified warm (37 °C) air across the culture lid. Migration was monitored over an 8-h period using a CCD camera (XC-75CE, Sony), and images were digitally acquired. The location of cell centroids at hourly intervals was tracked off-line (Northern Eclipse, Empix Imaging Inc.), and migration speed was determined as the sum of hourly distances divided by the total time. The proportion of cells that demonstrated nonlethal rupturing of a portion of the tail from the remainder of the advancing cell over the 8-h recording period was also determined. SMCs at near-confluence were incubated in M199 with 1% fetal bovine serum for 24 h and then incubated with 25 ng/ml FGF-2 for the designated time. Culture supernatant was harvested, and cells were dissociated by incubating with 0.53 mmol/liter EDTA in PBS for 20 min. After washing twice in cold PBS, the cells were disrupted in a solution of 10 mmol/liter Tris, pH 7.4, 1% SDS, 0.1 mmol/liter EDTA, 0.1 mmol/liter phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride (PMSF), and 10 μg/ml leupeptin. DNA in the samples was sheared by passing the cell lysate through a 27-gauge needle, and insoluble material was removed by centrifugation (12,000 rpm at 4 °C) for 30 min. The protein concentration in the supernatant was measured by Bio-Rad DC protein assay kit. Equal amount of proteins were resolved by 12% SDS-PAGE and electrophoretically transferred to polyvinylidine difluoride (PVDF) membranes (Millipore, Bedford, MA) for Western blot analysis. The membranes were blocked overnight at 4 °C and then incubated with anti-collagenase-1 antibody (Mb-1, Oncogene Sciences). Bound primary antibody was detected with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated goat anti-mouse IgG F(ab′)2, and blots were developed with ECL detection reagents (Roche Molecular Biochemicals). Collagenase-1 expression was also evaluated by gelatin zymography. Culture media and cell lysates were prepared as above but without addition of protease inhibitors. Proteins were separated under nonreducing conditions on 12% polyacrylamide gels embedded with 1 mg/ml gelatin (Sigma). Gels were washed in 2.5% Triton X-100 and incubated at 37 °C for 48 h in buffer containing 50 mmol/liter Tris (pH 8.0), 5 mmol/liter CaCl2, and 40 mmol/liter NaN3 and were stained with Coomassie Brilliant Blue (Sigma). MMP activity is manifest as clear lysis zones against a blue background. To confirm that MMP action was the cause of substrate degradation, duplicate gels were prepared in which zymography was performed in the presence of 10 mmol/liter EDTA, which completely blocked substrate lysis. Association of collagenase-1 with the plasma membrane was assessed by surface labeling with biotin and immunoprecipitation. Control and FGF-2-treated SMCs were incubated with 0.5 mg/ml sulfo-NHS-biotin (Pierce) in PBS, pH 7.8, for 20 min on ice. After washing with cold PBS, cells were treated with glycine (0.1 mol/liter in PBS, pH 7.8) to block residual NHS groups. Cells were washed twice in cold PBS (pH 7.4) and disrupted in Nonidet P-40 lysis buffer (50 mmol/liter Tris, pH 7.5, 150 mmol/liter NaCl, 1% Nonidet P-40, 1 mmol/liter EDTA, 1 mmol/liter PMSF, 10 μg/ml leupeptin). Equal amounts of protein lysates were precleared with protein G Plus-agarose bead conjugate (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc.) and then incubated with 1 μg of anti-collagenase-1 mAb (Oncogene Science) at 4 °C for 1 h. Antigen-antibody complex was captured by incubation overnight with protein G Plus-agarose conjugate at 4 °C and the resulting complex washed four times in radioimmune precipitation assay buffer (50 mmol/liter Tris, pH 7.5, 150 mmol/liter NaCl, 1% Nonidet P-40, 0.5% sodium deoxycholate, 0.1% SDS, 1 mmol/liter PMSF, 10 μg/ml leupeptin). Immunoprecipitates were analyzed by SDS-PAGE under reducing condition, and proteins were electrophoretically transferred to PVDF membranes. To verify induction of collagenase-1 expression, blots were probed with anti-collagenase-1 antibody and developed with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated goat anti-mouse IgG F(ab′)2 and chemiluminescence detection reagents (ECL, Roche Molecular Biochemicals), and exposed on Kodak O-Mat Blue XB-1 film. To determine if collagenase-1 was associated with the cell surface, blots were probed directly with avidin-horseradish peroxidase (Sigma). To confirm that cytoplasmic proteins were not labeled by the biotinylation procedure, parallel immunoprecipitation using anti-SM α-actin antibody was performed with blots probed for either SM α-actin or biotin. Human vascular SMCs were incubated with 25 ng/ml FGF-2 or vehicle for 48 h and then plated on glass coverslips precoated with type I collagen (100 μg/ml) and cultured overnight. Cells and substrate were washed twice with PBS and fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde in PBS. After blocking nonspecific binding sites with 10% goat serum, culture materials were incubated with R1822, a rabbit anti-human 1/4 3/4 collagen fragment polyclonal antibody (kindly provided by Dr. A. R. Poole, Shriners Hospital, Montreal, Quebec, Canada). This antibody detects carboxyl-terminal (COL2–3/4C(short)) and amino-terminal (COL2–1/4N1) neoepitopes generated by collagenase-1 action (28Billinghurst R.C. Dahlberg L. Ionescu M. Reiner A. Bourne R. Rorabeck C. Mitchell P. Hambor J. Diekmann O. Tschesche H. Chen J. Van Wart H. Poole A.R. J. Clin. Invest. 1997; 99: 1534-1545Crossref PubMed Scopus (875) Google Scholar). Fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated goat anti-rabbit antibody was then applied, and nuclei were counterstained with Hoechst 33258. SMCs stimulated to migrate in the artery wall must utilize mechanisms to interact with the abundant type I collagen. We previously found that FGF-2 enhanced the migration of SMCs on collagen and can potentiate directed migration of cells on this substrate to PDGF-BB (16Pickering J.G. Uniyal S. Ford C. Chau T. Laurin M.A. Chow L.H. Ellis C.G. Fish J. Chan B.M.C. Circ. Res. 1997; 80: 627-637Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). In addition, FGF-2 induced the expression of collagenase-1 by SMCs (19Pickering J.G. Ford C.M. Tang B. Chow L.H. Arterioscler. Thromb. Vasc. Biol. 1997; 17: 475-482Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). To determine if FGF-2-stimulated SMC migration on collagen required the action of MMPs, SMCs were treated with FGF-2 for 48 h and migration toward PDGF-BB was studied in the presence or absence of the hydroxamic acid-containing MMP inhibitor, CP-138,521 (kindly provided by Pfizer, Groton, CT). This compound inhibits MMPs, nonselectively, by ligating the zinc cation in the active site via its hydroxamic acid group. As shown in Fig.1, the enhanced SMC chemotaxis to PDGF-BB afforded by FGF-2 was abrogated by CP-138,521. Similar results were seen with the MMP inhibitors phenanthrolin and EDTA (data not shown).Figure 1Effect of MMP inhibitors on FGF-2-enhanced SMC chemotaxis to PDGF on type I collagen-coated membranes. These two growth factors have both been proven to mediate SMC migration in the injured artery wall (17Jackson C.L. Reidy M.A. Am. J. Pathol. 1993; 143: 1024-1031PubMed Google Scholar, 18Ferns G.A.A. Raines E.W. Sprugel K. Motani A.S. Reidy M.A. Ross R. Science. 1991; 253: 1129-1132Crossref PubMed Scopus (947) Google Scholar). SMCs were treated with 25 ng/ml FGF-2 for 48 h. Chemotaxis assay was then performed using migration chambers with PDGF-BB (10 ng/ml) in the bottom well and the hydroxamic acid MMP inhibitor, CP-138,521 (0, 10, or 100 nmol/liter) in the upper well. *, p < 0.01 versus untreated control; #, p < 0.01 versus control SMCs treated with FGF-2.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) To determine if FGF-2-enhanced chemotaxis on type I collagen was mediated specifically by collagenase-1, FGF-2-pretreated or untreated SMCs were added to the upper well of chemotaxis chamber together with anti-human collagenase-1 neutralizing antibody (VI3 IA6, kindly provided Dr. L. J. Windsor, University of Alabama at Birmingham) (29Birkedal-Hansen B. Moore W.G. Taylor R.E. Bhown A.S. Birkedal-Hansen H. Biochemistry. 1988; 27: 6751-6758Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar) or normal mouse IgG. As shown in Fig.2, FGF-2-stimulated SMC chemotaxis to PDGF was completely blocked by VI3 IA6. This antibody had no significant effect on motility of SMCs not stimulated with FGF-2. To quantify SMC migration speed and migration path on type I collagen, digital time-lapse video microscopy was performed. SMCs were plated on culture dishes precoated with 100 μg/ml type I collagen and were incubated with FGF-2 or vehicle for 48 h. Time-lapse recording was carried out for 8 h in the presence of collagenase-1 neutralizing antibody or control normal mouse IgG. As shown in Fig.3 A, the migration path of SMCs treated with FGF-2 and control IgG was greater than that of cells incubated with control IgG alone, with a corresponding increase in migration speed (Fig. 3 B). In contrast, the collagenase-1 neutralizing antibody reduced the migration speed to the control level (Fig. 3 B), corresponding to a restrained migration path (Fig. 3 A). Collagenase-1 cleaves a single site in the collagen triple helix, which, in turn, yields a denatured substrate that has the potential to interact with the cell in a manner distinct from that of native collagen. To corroborate the findings using the anti-collagenase-1 antibody and to directly determine if collagen proteolysis per se was required for the optimized SMC motility afforded by FGF-2, we studied the migration of SMCs plated on collagenase-resistant mutant collagen. This substrate was prepared from tails of transgenic mice bearing a targeted collagen mutation at collagenase-1 cleavage site. The mutation constitutes a substitution of 3 amino acids at the collagenase cleavage site of the α1(I) collagen chain (30Wu H. Liu X. Jaenisch R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 2819-2823Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar, 31Liu X. Wu H. Byrne M. Jeffrey J. Krane S. Jaenisch R. J. Cell Biol. 1995; 130: 227-237Crossref PubMed Scopus (244) Google Scholar). As shown in Fig.4, SMCs migrating on wild-type mouse type I collagen manifest a 1.5-fold increase in migration speed after stimulation with FGF-2. However, FGF-2 had no effect on SMC motility when cells were plated on collagenase-resistant mutant collagen. During cell migration, tail release from the substrate is believed to be a rate-limiting step. In primary human SMCs derived from internal thoracic artery, and in a human SMC clone (HITB5) derived from the same source (26Li S. Sims S. Jiao Y. Chow L.H. Pickering J.G. Circ. Res. 1999; 85: 338-348Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar), prominent tails are a consistent feature of migrating cells. In addition, ripping of a fragment of trailing plasma membrane, visible on Hoffman modulated contrast microscopy, was frequently observed just prior to retraction of the cell rear and advancement of the cell body. Occasionally, these remnants autonomously spread and crawled for short time. Fig.5 A shows time-lapse-acquired photomicrographs of control and FGF-2-treated HITB5 SMCs migrating on type I collagen (movies are available as supplemental material to the online version of this article). Compared with control cells, FGF-2-treated cells migrated more quickly, and many of the cells could be seen to migrate in a smooth, gliding motion. This was in striking contrast to the discrete extension and retraction events seen in the control SMCs. The mean tail length (distance from rear-most tip of the tail to rear edge of the cell nucleus) of FGF-2-treated SMCs was significantly shorter than that of control cells (124 ± 11 μmversus 226 ± 14 μm, p < 0.01,n = 26 cells per group, measured at the start of the recording period). As well, the proportion of SMCs that displayed tail ripping over the 8-h recording period was significantly lower in the FGF-2-treated cultures (4.6 ± 0.9% versus 17.4 ± 2.8%, p < 0.01) (Fig. 5 B). Pooled data from control and FGF-2-treated SMCs established an inverse correlation between cell migration speed and tail ripping (r = −0.8, p < 0.01). Importantly, when FGF-2-treated SMCs were incubated with anti-collagenase-1 antibody, the gliding motion reverted to the more halting pattern of translocation. As well, mean tail length was not significantly different from control, unstimulated SMCs, and the frequency of tail-ripping likewise returned to baseline (Fig. 5, A and B). To maintain structural integrity of the vessel wall, the proteolytic actions of collagenases must be spatially confined. In recent years, soluble ECM proteinases, including MMP-2 and MMP-9, have been found to be bound to the plasma membrane, implicating a mechanism for localizing ECM proteolysis to the immediate pericellular environment (32Brooks P.C.

This response is very important for the host defense, which involves the engulfment of invading microorganisms, and also for prevention of leakage of hemolymph (1Iwanaga S. Curr. Opin.

The LPS-mediated coagulation cascade involves three serine protease zymogens, including factor C, factor B, and the proclotting enzyme, and a clottable protein coagulogen (1Iwanaga S. Curr. Opin.

In the presence of LPS, factor C is autocatalytically converted to its active form. The activated factor C catalyzes the activation of factor B, and, in turn, the active form of factor B converts the proclotting enzyme to the clotting enzyme. The coagulation cascade is also activated by (1,3)-β-d-glucan, a major cell wall component of fungi, through the activation of another serine protease zymogen of factor G, which directly activates the proclotting enzyme to the clotting enzyme (1Iwanaga S.

The clotting enzyme cleaves coagulogen of 175 amino acid residues at two sites, yielding a fragment called peptide C (Thr19–Arg46) and the resulting coagulin, which consists of the NH2-terminal A-chain (Ala1–Arg18) and the COOH-terminal B-chain (Gly47–Phe175), connected by two disulfide bridges, forms an insoluble gel by self-polymerization (7Nakamura S.

Crystal structural analysis of coagulogen revealed an elongated molecule (approximate dimensions, 60 × 30 × 20 Å) with a topological similarity to nerve growth factor (10Bergner A. Oganessyan V. Muta T. Iwanaga S. Typke D. Huber R. Bode W. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 6789-6797Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar, 11Bergner A. Muta T. Iwanaga S. Beisel H.-G. Delotto R. Bode W. Biol. Chem. 1997; 379: 283-287Google Scholar). The structural analysis suggested a possible polymerization mechanism, in which the release of the helical peptide C would expose a hydrophobic cove on the “head,” which interacts with the hydrophobic edge or “tail” of a second molecule, resulting in the formation of coagulin gel. Here, by using chemical cross-linkers and synthetic peptides, we obtained evidence that the polymerization of coagulin proceeds through the interaction between the hydrophobic cove on the head and the hydrophobic tail.

( Tokyo ). 1985; 97: 1561-1574Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar) were prepared from hemocyte lysates of Tachypleus tridentatus as described. Homobifunctional cross-linkers, disuccinimidyl suberate (DSS), disuccinimidyl glutarate (DSG), and disuccinimidyl tartrate (DST) were obtained from Pierce. TPCK-trypsin was obtained from Worthington. Coagulogen (1 mg/ml in 20 mmHEPES, pH 8.0) was incubated with the clotting enzyme at 37 °C for 1 h (enzyme/substrate = 1/38, w/w). The resulting coagulin gel was dissolved by 10-fold dilution with the same buffer to a final concentration of 0.1 mg/ml, and no clot formation was observed under these conditions. A cross-linker in dimethylformamide was added to the coagulin solution to give a final concentration of 0.2 mm, and the solution was further incubated at 25 °C for 30 min. The reaction was stopped by adding 1 m Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, to give a final concentration of 0.1 m, followed by incubation at 25 °C for 15 min. Cross-linked coagulin was treated with 10% trichloroacetic acid and the resulting precipitate was used for SDS-PAGE and tryptic digestion. As a negative control, cross-linking experiments for coagulogen were carried out under the same conditions. SDS-PAGE was performed in 15% slab gels under reducing conditions, according to the procedure described by Laemmli (13Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (207018) Google Scholar). The gels were stained with Coomassie Brilliant Blue R-250. The reference proteins were phosphorylase b (M r = 94,000), bovine serum albumin (M r = 67,000), ovalbumin (M r = 43,000), carbonic anhydrase (M r = 30,000), soybean trypsin inhibitor (M r = 20, 000) and α-lactoalbumin (M r = 14, 400). The precipitate of cross-linked coagulin (250 μg) was dissolved in 0.4m NH4HCO3 containing 8m. It was reduced and S-alkylated with iodoacetamide (14Stone K.L. LoPresti M.B. Crawford J.M. DeAngelis R. Williams K.R. Matsudaira P.T. A Practical Guide to Protein and Peptide Purification for Microsequencing. Academic Press, San Diego, CA1989: 31-47Google Scholar), then digested with TPCK-trypsin (enzyme/substrate = 1/20, w/w). The resulting peptides were separated by reverse-phase HPLC on a column of Cosmosil5C18-MS (2.0 × 150 mm, Nacalai tesque, Inc., Kyoto, Japan). Peptides were eluted with a linear gradient of 0–80% acetonitrile in 0.06% trifluoroacetic acid at a flow rate of 0.2 ml/min. Absorbance was monitored at 210 nm. Amino acid sequence analysis was performed with the Applied Biosystems gas-phase sequencer model 473A. The oligopeptides, Ala-Gly-Tyr-Asn and Ser-Ala-Gly-Tyr-Asn-Gly, were synthesized by the manual solid phase method using t-butoxycarbonyl amino acids. Coupling reactions were carried out with 2-(1H-benzotriazole-1-yl)-1,1,3,3-tetramethyluronium hexafluorophosphate in the presence of 1-hydroxybenzotriazole in a mixture of N-methylpyrrolidone andN,N-dimethylformamide (1:2, v/v) for 30 min. Peptides were liberated from the resin by treatment with anhydrous liquid HF containing 10% p-cresol at 0 °C for 1 h. Syntheses of Asn-Ser-Ala-Gly-Tyr-Asn-Gly-Arg, Asn-Ser-Ala-Gly-Phe-Asn-Gly-Arg, Asn-Ser-Ala-Gly-Ala-Asn-Gly-Arg, and Cys (acetamidomethyl)-Asn-Ser-Ala-Gly-Tyr-Asn-Gly-Arg-Cys (acetamidomethyl) were performed on the Applied Biosystems peptide synthesizer model 430A, employing the 0.1-mmol scale 9-fluorenylmethoxdycarbonyl synthetic strategy (Fast MocTM protocol). The detachment and deprotection of synthesized peptides were performed by Reagent K for 3 h (15King D.S. Fields C.G. Fields G.B. Int. J. Pept. Protein Res. 1990; 36: 255-266Crossref PubMed Scopus (730) Google Scholar). Cyclization of the linear peptide with iodine in aqueous acetic acid was performed according to the procedure described by Buku et al. (16Buku A. Reibman J. Pistelli A. Blandina P. Gazis D. J. Protein Chem. 1992; 11: 275-280Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). The purity of the peptides was verified by analytical reverse-phase HPLC (0.4 × 25 cm, LiChrospher 100 RP-18). Coagulogen (2 mg/ml in 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0) was treated with TPCK-trypsin (enzyme/substrate = 1/100, w/w) in the presence and absence of synthetic peptides, respectively. The time course of gel formation was monitored by measuring the scattered light at 339 nm with the Hitachi U-2000A spectrophotometer, as described previously for fibrin polymerization (17Latallo Z. Fletcher A.P. Alkjaersig N. Sherry S. Am. J. Physiol. 1962; 202: 675-680Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). Coagulogen (0.2 mg/ml in 10 mmsodium acetate, pH 6.0) was immobilized on a sensor chip CM5 of the BIAcore system (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech, Uppsala, Sweden), according to the manufacturer's specifications. Immobilized coagulogen was then converted to coagulin in the instrument by treatment with TPCK-trypsin (10 μg/ml) at room temperature for 60 min at a flow rate of 2 μl/min. After washing the coagulin-immobilized sensor chip with a buffer (10 mm HEPES, pH 7.4, containing 0.15 mNaCl, 3.4 mm EDTA, and 0.005% Tween 20), coagulogen was injected at 10 μl/min in the same buffer, and the change in the mass concentration on the sensor chip was monitored as a resonance signal by using the program supplied by the manufacturer. Sensorgrams of the interactions obtained using various concentrations of coagulogen (0.25–1.0 mg/ml) were analyzed by using the software with which the instrument was equipped. Coagulin, produced after incubation of coagulogen with the clotting enzyme or TPCK-trypsin, forms a soft clot at a concentration of 1 mg/ml, and the clot can be easily dissolved by 10-fold dilution, then vortex-mixing. Under these conditions, an amine-reactive bifunctional cross-linker, DSS with an arm length of 11.4 Å was added, then an aliquot was subjected to SDS-PAGE. In addition to the coagulin monomer, cross-linked products, which, based on their molecular weights, corresponded to the dimer, trimer, and tetramer, were observed (Fig.1, lane 3). Similar cross-linking patterns of the coagulin oligomers were observed on SDS-PAGE by using DSG and DST with shorter arm lengths of 7.7 and 6.4 Å, respectively (data not shown). For coagulogen, no cross-linked oligomers by DSS was observed under the same conditions, and a new band with a lower molecular weight appeared (Fig. 1, lane 2), which, given the more compact protein structure of coagulogen (i.e. three more lysine residues in the peptide C region), was probably produced by intrachain cross-linking (18Tae H.J. Methods Enzymol. 1983; 91: 580-609Crossref PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar). These results suggest that the two functional amino groups are localized near the interaction sites, at a distance within 6.4 Å. The bifunctional cross-linkers used in this study react with an amino group of lysine and an NH2-terminal amino group, and coagulin contains four lysines at residues 62, 85, 126, and 156, respectively (9Takagi T. Hokama Y. Miyata T. Morita T. Iwanaga S. J. Biochem. ( Tokyo ). 1984; 95: 1445-1457Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). To identify the cross-linked residues, the DSS-treated coagulin was digested with TPCK-trypsin, and the resulting peptides were separated by reverse-phase HPLC. Untreated coagulin with the cross-linker was digested under the same conditions. Fig.2 shows the chromatograms of peptides derived from coagulin (A) and the cross-linked coagulin (B). One new peak, indicated by an asterisk, with a retention time of 55 min appeared after cross-linking. Amino acid sequence analysis revealed that this fragment consists of two peptides, at positions 75–92 and 149–165, connected by cross-linking between Lys85 and Lys156, as shown in TableI. No other cross-linked peptides were found. According to the crystal structure of coagulogen (10Bergner A. Oganessyan V. Muta T. Iwanaga S. Typke D. Huber R. Bode W. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 6789-6797Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar), Lys85 and Lys156 are located in the tail and head regions, respectively (see Fig. 5). The distance between the two residues was calculated as 46.6 Å by the using software Protein Adviser (Fujitsu Kyushu System Engineering, Ltd., Fukuoka, Japan). This length is much longer than that of any of the bifunctional cross-linkers tested, and thus there was no possibility of intramolecular cross-linking between the two lysine residues. These results indicate that the two lysine residues are chemically cross-linked intermolecularly.Table INH2-terminal sequence of the cross-linked fragmentTable INH2-terminal sequence of the cross-linked fragmenta nq, not quantitated.Figure 5A molecular model of coagulin-coagulin interaction.

The crystal structure of coagulogen indicated that the removal of peptide C exposes a hydrophobic cove on the head region (10Bergner A. Oganessyan V. Muta T. Iwanaga S. Typke D. Huber R. Bode W. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 6789-6797Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). Such structural change suggested a possible polymerization mechanism, by which the newly exposed head interacts with the hydrophobic tail containing Tyr136 of the second molecule, leading to a head-to-tail association in coagulin. To prove this hypothesis, an octapeptide corresponding to positions 132–139 was synthesized. A time course of the conversion of coagulogen to coagulin by TPCK-trypsin in the presence and absence of the octapeptide was monitored by spectrophotometer. The polymerization was dose-dependently inhibited by the addition of the octapeptide (Fig. 3 A). The re-plot of the initial velocities of polymerization versusthe concentrations of the octapeptide showed a 50% inhibitory concentration (IC50) of 2.3 mm (Fig.3 B). When Tyr136 of the octapeptide was replaced with Phe, the inhibitory effect was observed with a 2.5-fold higher IC50 of 5.7 mm. However, replacement with Ala demonstrated no inhibition on the polymerization at 5.0 mm(Table II). Inhibitory experiments at higher concentrations of the Ala136-containing peptide could not be carried out due to the low solubility of the peptide. The hexapeptide and tetrapeptide containing Tyr136 had no effect, suggesting that a proper conformation around Tyr136is required for the interaction. To mimic the β-turn of the original structure, an undecapeptide was synthesized with Cys replacing Ser131, and a disulfide bridge was formed, linking with Cys140. The undecapeptide exhibited a slightly lower IC50 than the octapeptide containing Tyr136(Table II).Table IIInhibition of coagulin-polymerization by various synthetic peptidesTable IIInhibition of coagulin-polymerization by various synthetic peptidesIC50, 50% inhibitory concentration of the initial velocity.a —, no inhibition at 5 mm. IC50, 50% inhibitory concentration of the initial velocity. a —, no inhibition at 5 mm. The hydrophobic tail portion of coagulin seems to have the same conformation as that of coagulogen, given that the cleavage and removal of the helical peptide C consistently occurs at the opposite side of the elongated molecule (10Bergner A. Oganessyan V. Muta T. Iwanaga S. Typke D. Huber R. Bode W. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 6789-6797Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). The tail region of coagulogen, therefore, could interact with the hydrophobic head of coagulin to form a heterodimer. To investigate this hypothesis, the interaction of coagulogen and the immobilized coagulin on a sensor chip was determined by surface plasmon resonance. Coagulogen at various concentrations was passed over the immobilized coagulin. Fig.4 shows the sensorgrams of association and dissociation reactions as a relative response against time. When coagulogen rather than coagulin was immobilized on the sensor chip, no interaction was observed between the coagulogen molecules (data not shown). Analysis of the association and dissociation phases of the sensorgrams revealed an association rate constant (k a) = 1.0 × 102m−1 s−1and a dissociation rate constant (k d) = 6.0 × 10−4 s−1, and, consequently, K a = 1.7 × 105m−1. Horseshoe crab hemolymph contains high concentrations of Ca2+ and Mg2+: 9.9 and 46 mm, respectively (19Robertson J.D. Biol. Bull. 1970; 138: 157-183Crossref Google Scholar). CaCl2 or MgCl2 at 10 mm, however, had no effect on the interaction between coagulogen and the immobilized coagulin. Hemolymph coagulation in horseshoe crab is thought to be analogous to the vertebrate-clotting cascade. Coagulogen, a functional homologue of fibrinogen, is proteolytically converted into coagulin to form an insoluble gel through non-covalent self-polymerization (7Nakamura S. Iwanaga S. Harada T. Niwa M. J. Biochem. ( Tokyo ). 1976; 80: 1011-1021Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar, 8Nakamura S. Takagi T. Iwanaga S. Niwa M. Takahashi K. Biochem.

The two proteins, however, are quite different in molecular size and amino acid sequence. Interestingly, a structural homologue of fibrinogen has recently been identified in horseshoe crab plasma, although it functions as a non-self-recognizing protein (20Gokudan S. Muta T. Tsuda R. Koori K. Kawahara T. Seki N. Mizunoe Y. Wai S.N. Iwanaga S. Kawabata S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 10086-10091Crossref PubMed Scopus (189) Google Scholar). The crystal structure of coagulogen suggested a possible polymerization mechanism, by which, it was theorized, the removal of the peptide C would expose a hydrophobic cove on the head of one coagulin, thereby providing a new interaction site for the hydrophobic surface of the second molecule (10Bergner A. Oganessyan V. Muta T. Iwanaga S. Typke D. Huber R. Bode W. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 6789-6797Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). We herein proved this hypothesis of the head-to-tail polymerization, by using chemical cross-linkers and synthetic peptides and by performing surface plasmon resonance analysis. Fig. 5 shows a putative structural model of a coagulin dimer formed through head-to-tail interaction. Lys85 in one molecule and Lys156 in another molecule can be within 6.4 Å apart after the conversion from coagulogen to coagulin, as demonstrated by cross-linking experiments. An octapeptide, corresponding to the hydrophobic tail, inhibited the polymerization of coagulin with IC50 of 2.3 mm(Fig. 3 and Table II). The replacement of Tyr136 of the octapeptide with Phe increased the IC50 value by 2.5-fold, whereas replacement with Ala showed no the inhibitory activity, suggesting the importance of Tyr136, particularly for the aromatic ring, in obtaining the proper affinity for polymerization. Furthermore, a hexapeptide containing Tyr136 also lost the inhibitory activity, indicating that the shorter peptide does not have sufficient ability to hold the conformation required for the interaction. Several synthetic peptides corresponding to the NH2-terminal regions of the fibrin α- and β-chains have been reported to prevent the polymerization of fibrin monomers, and a peptide of Gly-Pro-Arg-Pro was reported to bind to fibrinogen (21Yee V.C.

The surface plasmon resonance analysis revealed that the interaction of coagulogen with the immobilized coagulin, possibly through the tail of coagulogen and the head of coagulin, with K a = 1.7 × 105m−1. Not only the coagulin monomer but also coagulogen could be incorporated into a coagulin fiber, then converted to coagulin by the clotting enzyme, leading to the extension of the fiber. Relative to this finding, if serine proteases in the coagulation cascade are scavengedin vivo by the horseshoe crab serine protease inhibitors (25Miura Y. Kawabata S. Iwanaga S. J. Biol.

Electron microscopy showed that coagulin fibers have a tendency to aggregate laterally to form a thicker fiber with a diameter of about 100 Å, probably through other hydrophobic patches on the surface of coagulogen (10Bergner A. Oganessyan V. Muta T. Iwanaga S. Typke D. Huber R. Bode W. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 6789-6797Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). The resulting thick fibers may form a reticulate, catching invading bacteria and substances from outside. The binding site(s) for such side-to-side interaction remains to be determined. A hypothetical scheme of the gel formation is shown in Fig. 6. In the vertebrate coagulation system, factor XIIIa, a plasma transglutaminase, covalently cross-links fibrin to convert a stable cross-linked fibrin with itself or with other proteins, which is essential for normal homeostasis and wound healing (28Lorand L. Credo R.B. Janus T.J. Methods Enzymol. 1981; 80: 333-341Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar). In horseshoe crab hemolymph, however, a transglutaminase is present in the cytosol of hemocytes but not in the plasma (29Tokunaga F. Yamada M. Miyata T. Ding Y.-L. Hiranaga-Kawabata M. Muta T.

Chem. 1993; 268: 262-268Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Furthermore, coagulogen and coagulin themselves are not substrates for the hemocyte transglutaminase; the proteins of 8.6 and 80 kDa present in hemocytes serve as substrates for the transglutaminase (4Iwanaga S. Kawabata S. Muta T. J. Biochem. ( Tokyo ). 1998; 123: 1-15Crossref PubMed Scopus (253) Google Scholar, 29Tokunaga F. Yamada M. Miyata T. Ding Y.-L. Hiranaga-Kawabata M. Muta T. Iwanaga S. Ichinose A.

Another protease cascade in invertebrates, the morphogenetic cascade for determining embryonic dorsal-ventral polarity in the flyDrosophila melanogaster, has been well characterized at the molecular level (31Belvin M.P. Anderson K.V. Annu. Rev. Cell Dev. Biol. 1996; 12: 393-416Crossref PubMed Scopus (681) Google Scholar). The structural similarity of the target protein of the cascade, Drosophila toll-receptor ligand spätzle, to horseshoe crab coagulogen, as well as the sequence homology between the serine proteases of the two cascades, suggest that these two functionally different cascades may have a common origin (10Bergner A. Oganessyan V. Muta T. Iwanaga S. Typke D. Huber R. Bode W. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 6789-6797Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar,11Bergner A. Muta T. Iwanaga S. Beisel H.-G. Delotto R. Bode W. Biol.

Nature. 1994; 368: 548-551Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). The activation of Drosophila toll is also critical in the production of antibacterial and antifungal peptides as a response to microbial infection (34Hoffmann J.A. Kafatos F.C. Janeway Jr., C.A. Ezekowitz R.A.B. Science. 1999; 284: 1313-1318Crossref PubMed Scopus (2150) Google Scholar, 35Anderson K.V. Curr. Opin. Immunol. 2000; 12: 13-19Crossref PubMed Scopus (524) Google Scholar). Although the molecular mechanism for the activation of toll by spätzle is not currently known, many membrane receptors are known to be activated through ligand-induced dimerization or oligomerization (36Lemmon M.A. Schlessinger J. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1994; 19: 459-463Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (433) Google Scholar). Based on consideration of the polymerization process of coagulin, it seems possible that the ligand spätzle may also induce dimerization or oligomerization of Drosophila toll, leading to the activation of intercellular signaling (37Mizuguchi K. Parker J.S. Blundell T.L. Gay N.J. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1998; 23: 239-242Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). Ideally, the polymerization mechanism demonstrated here in coagulin will contribute to the body of knowledge concerning proteolysis-induced associations of proteins in various biological phenomena.

Trio was originally identified as a LAR tyrosine phosphatase-binding protein and is involved in actin remodeling, cell migration, and cell growth. Herein we provide evidence that Trio not only activates RhoA but is also a RhoA target. The RhoA-binding site was mapped to the Trio immunoglobulin-like domain. RhoA isoprenylation is necessary for the RhoA-Trio interaction, because mutation of the RhoA carboxyl-terminal cysteine residue blocked binding. The existence of an intramolecular functional link between RhoA activation and RhoA binding is suggested by the finding that Trio exchange activity enhanced RhoA binding to Trio. Furthermore, immunofluorescence studies of HeLa cells showed that although ectopically expressed Trio was evenly distributed within the cell, co-expression of Trio with RhoA resulted in relocalization of Trio into punctate structures. Relocalization was not observed with Trio constructs lacking the immunoglobulin-like domain, indicating that RhoA acts to regulate Trio localization via binding to the immunoglobulin-like domain. We propose that Trio-mediated RhoA activation and subsequent RhoA-mediated relocalization of Trio functions to modulate and coordinate Trio signaling.

Dbl homology guanine nucleotide exchange factor GDP dissociation inhibitor glutathione S-transferase hemagglutinin monoclonal antibody polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis pleckstrin homology phosphate-buffered saline Trio is an unusual member of the Dbl homology (DH)1 family of guanine nucleotide exchange factors (GEFs) because it contains two DH GEF domains in addition to a protein serine/threonine kinase, two SH3-like domains, an Ig-like domain, and at least four spectrin-like repeats (schematically shown in Fig. 1; Ref. 1Debant A.

DH GEF family members function to activate Rho GTPases such as, RhoA, Rac1, and Cdc42 by promoting the exchange of GDP for GTP (2Cerione R.A. Zheng Y. Curr. Opin.

Once these molecular switches are activated, Rho GTPases function in diverse cellular processes including actin cytoskeleton organization, mitogen-activated protein kinase cascade signaling, and gene transcription (3Zohn I.M.

DH GEFs all contain a ∼260-amino acid DH domain immediately followed by a ∼100-amino acid pleckstrin homology (PH) domain, and some DH GEFs such as Trio contain additional catalytic domains and auxiliary domains (2Cerione R.A.

The regulation of DH GEFs is incompletely understood, but PH domain-mediated interactions with phospholipids or proteins, phosphorylation of DH GEF proteins, or interactions of DH GEFs with other GTPases may be involved (2Cerione R.A.

The solution structure of the amino-terminal Trio-GEF/PH region revealed that the GEF and PH domains interact with one another, and mutational analysis demonstrated that the PH domain enhances Trio GEF activity for Rac1 in vitro (24Liu X.

Trio was originally isolated by virtue of its binding to the intracellular region of the LAR transmembrane protein-tyrosine phosphatase, and the Trio segment that binds the LAR PTP-D2 domain was shown to include the Ig-like and protein serine/threonine kinase domains (1Debant A. Serra-Pages C. Seipel K. O'Brien S. Tang M. Park S.H. Streuli M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 5466-5471Crossref PubMed Scopus (399) Google Scholar). The Trio amino-terminal GEF domain (GEF-D1) displays Rac1 activity, and the carboxyl-terminal GEF domain (GEF-D2) exhibits RhoA GEF activity in vitro (1Debant A. Serra-Pages C. Seipel K. O'Brien S. Tang M. Park S.H. Streuli M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 5466-5471Crossref PubMed Scopus (399) Google Scholar). Trio GEF-D1 was also recently shown to activate RhoG in vitro and in cells (27Blangy A. Vignal E. Schmidt S. Debant A. Gauthier-Rouviere C. Fort P. J. Cell Sci. 2000; 113: 729-739Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Expression of Trio GEF-D1 causes prominent membrane ruffling, whereas cells expressing Trio GEF-D2 have increased stress fibers and lamellae that terminate in miniruffles (28Seipel K. Medley Q.G. Kedersha N.L. Zhang X.A. O'Brien S.P. Serra-Pages C. Hemler M.E. Streuli M. J. Cell Sci. 1999; 112: 1825-1834Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 29Bellanger J.M. Lazaro J.B. Diriong S. Fernandez A. Lamb N. Debant A. Oncogene. 1998; 16: 147-152Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar). Furthermore, cells expressing Trio GEF-D1 display increased haptotactic migration and anchorage-independent growth, suggesting that Trio regulates matrix-induced signal transduction (28Seipel K. Medley Q.G. Kedersha N.L. Zhang X.A. O'Brien S.P. Serra-Pages C. Hemler M.E. Streuli M. J. Cell Sci. 1999; 112: 1825-1834Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Transient expression of full-length Trio alters actin cytoskeleton organization, as well as the distribution of focal contact sites (28Seipel K. Medley Q.G. Kedersha N.L. Zhang X.A. O'Brien S.P. Serra-Pages C. Hemler M.E. Streuli M. J. Cell Sci. 1999; 112: 1825-1834Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). These findings support a role for Trio as a multifunctional protein involved in coordinating actin remodeling necessary for cell migration and growth. The unusual configuration of tandem DH GEF domains, as well as a kinase domain, suggested the possibility that the activity of one or more of the Trio domains could be regulated by the activity of another domain. To test this possibility, we initially examined whether Trio itself might be a target for Rho or Rac. Co-expression studies indicated that RhoA, but not Rac1 or Cdc42, bound Trio, and mapping studies identified the Trio Ig-like domain as the RhoA-binding site. Trio GEF-D2 activity increased the amount of RhoA bound to Trio, providing evidence for a direct link between Trio-mediated RhoA activation and RhoA binding to Trio. Because RhoA binding to Trio required the most carboxyl-terminal cysteine residue, which is the site of lipid modification, RhoA isoprenylation is required for binding to the Trio Ig-like domain. Furthermore, immunofluorescence studies of HeLa cells indicated that RhoA binding to the Trio Ig-like domain functions to regulate Trio localization. Trio expression constructs were made using standard techniques and confirmed by restriction mapping and, in some cases, DNA sequencing. Trio cDNA constructs were cloned into the pMT.HA tag (30Serra-Pages C. Kedersha N.L. Fazikas L. Medley Q. Debant A. Streuli M. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 2827-2838Crossref PubMed Scopus (294) Google Scholar) or pMT.Myc tag expression vectors, which encode either a HA or Myc epitope tag sequence immediately upstream of the cloning site. The extent of the Trio regions encoded by these plasmids are schematically shown in Fig. 1. Amino acid numbering of Trio is according to a full-length Trio of 3038 amino acids (GenBankTM accession number UF091395). The HA-Trio.mD2 and HA-Trio.mGSIK constructs have residues 2050–2056 deleted within the GEF-D2 domain and have no detectable exchange activity in vitro (29Bellanger J.M. Lazaro J.B. Diriong S. Fernandez A. Lamb N. Debant A. Oncogene. 1998; 16: 147-152Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar). Rho GTPases were expressed as GST fusion proteins using the pEBG vector (31Chou M.M. Blenis J. Cell. 1996; 85: 573-583Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (267) Google Scholar) or as Myc-tagged GTPases using the pMT·Myc tag vector. The pGEX-rhotekin construct contains the rhotekin RhoA-binding domain (amino acids 7–89) (32Ren X.D. Kiosses W.B. Schwartz M.A. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 578-585Crossref PubMed Scopus (1369) Google Scholar). COS-7 cell transient transfections were done by the DEAE-dextran/Me2SO method using ∼2 μg of plasmid DNA/2 × 105 cells, and cells were harvested ∼20 h after transfection. Proteins were metabolically labeled with [35S]methionine and [35S]cysteine labeling during the final 4 h prior to harvesting of cells. HeLa cells were transfected by calcium phosphate precipitation and fixed and stained 3 days after transfection as described previously (33Serra-Pages C. Medley Q.G. Tang M. Hart A. Streuli M. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 15611-15620Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (230) Google Scholar). Cell proteins were metabolically labeled with [35S]methionine and [35S]cysteine essentially as described previously (30Serra-Pages C. Kedersha N.L. Fazikas L. Medley Q. Debant A. Streuli M. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 2827-2838Crossref PubMed Scopus (294) Google Scholar). Following labeling, cells were washed in PBS, lysed in Nonidet P-40 lysis buffer (1% Nonidet P-40, 150 mm NaCl, 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 5 mm MgCl2) containing 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 10 μg/ml leupeptin, and 10 μg/ml aprotinin. Insoluble material was removed from the lysates by centrifugation in a microcentrifuge. Cell lysates were then precleared once with 25 μl of protein A-Sepharose (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) for 1–2 h. For immunoprecipitations 1 μl of anti-HA mAb 12CA5 ascites fluid and 25 μl of protein A-Sepharose were added per ml of precleared lysate for 1 h. Precipitates were then washed with buffer containing 0.1% Nonidet P-40, 150 mmNaCl, 25 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), and 5 mmMgCl2. Precipitated proteins were analyzed using SDS-PAGE under reducing conditions followed by autoradiography. Proteins from cell lysates or co-precipitated proteins from nonlabeled cells were resolved by SDS-PAGE and then transferred to Immobilon-P (Millipore, Bedford, MA), and immunoblots were probed with the anti-HA mAb HA 11 (BabCO, Richmond, CA) or the anti-GST mAb 112 (ImmunoGen, Cambridge, MA). Cellular activation of RhoA was detected using the GST-rhotekin binding assay (32Ren X.D. Kiosses W.B. Schwartz M.A. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 578-585Crossref PubMed Scopus (1369) Google Scholar). Briefly, cells were lysed as described above, and GTP-RhoA was precipitated with 5 μg of bacterially expressed GST-rhotekin (rhotekin amino acids 7–89). The precipitates were boiled in SDS-PAGE sample buffer, electrophoresed, blotted, and probed with anti-HA mAb HA 11. Immunoblots were developed with rabbit anti-mouse horseradish peroxidase-conjugated IgG (Dako, Carpinteria, CA) and the chemiluminescence reagent, luminol, essentially as described by the supplier (PerkinElmer Life Sciences). HeLa cells were rinsed in PBS, fixed in 2% paraformaldehyde/PBS for 15 min, and then permeabilized for 10 min in 0.1% Triton X-100/PBS containing 2% horse serum. Nonspecific Ab-binding sites were blocked by a 30-min incubation in blocking buffer (10% normal goat serum in PBS). To detect HA-Trio and GST-RhoA, permeabilized cells were exposed to the anti-HA mAb HA 11 and anti-GST for 1 h and washed, and then the primary Abs were detected with a 30-min treatment of Texas red-linked goat anti-mouse IgG2a (Southern Biotech., Birmingham, AL) and fluorescein isothiocyanate-linked goat anti-mouse IgG1 (Southern Biotech). Slides were mounted in a polyvinyl alcohol medium and viewed on a Nikon E800 microscope equipped for epifluorescence or on a Bio-Rad MRC-1024 laser scanning confocal microscope equipped for epifluorescence, and images were obtained at 0.35-μm intervals. Co-localization coefficients were obtained using the LaserSharp version 3.2 software package (Bio-Rad). The two Trio GEF domains have distinct substrate specificities: the amino-terminal GEF-D1 domain has Rac1 activity, whereas the carboxyl-terminal GEF-D2 domain has RhoA activityin vitro (1Debant A. Serra-Pages C. Seipel K. O'Brien S. Tang M. Park S.H. Streuli M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 5466-5471Crossref PubMed Scopus (399) Google Scholar). To assess whether Trio itself may be target for RhoA, Rac1, or Cdc42, we performed a series of co-precipitation experiments to determine the ability of GST-tagged Rho GTPases to bind HA-tagged full-length Trio or various Trio deletion constructs (Fig.1; the overall structure of Trio is schematically shown at the top of figure, andbelow are shown the extent of the various Trio deletion constructs used in this study). To this end, COS-7 cells were co-transfected with HA-tagged Trio (HA-Trio, amino acids 1–3038) together with GST-tagged, constitutively activate (V14RhoA, V12Rac1, and V12Cdc42) or dominant-negative (N19RhoA and N17Rac1) forms of RhoA, Rac1, and Cdc42, and following transfection, proteins were metabolically labeled with [35S]methionine and [35S]cysteine, extracts were prepared, and then GST fusion proteins were recovered using Glutathione-Sepharose. As seen in Fig. 2, Trio bound GST-V14RhoA (Fig. 2,upper panel, lane 2), suggesting that Trio could indeed be a RhoA target. The binding appeared specific to RhoA because neither GST, GST-V12Rac1, -N17Rac1, nor -V12Cdc42 appreciably bound Trio, even though the expression levels of Trio and the various GST-tagged GTPases were comparable in the various co-transfections (Fig. 2 and data not shown). Equal expression levels of full-length HA-Trio in the presence of GST-V14RhoA and GST-N19RhoA were only possible at lower levels of GST-N19RhoA expression, perhaps because of cell toxicity. However, Trio consistently bound more (2.5–6-fold) GST-V14RhoA than GST-N19RhoA, as determined by densitometric scanning of autoradiograms and correcting for the amount Trio present in the various co-transfections, suggesting that Trio preferentially bound activated RhoA (Fig. 2 and data not shown). Although GST-V12Rac1, -N17Rac1, and -V12Cdc42 did not appreciably bind Trio, they did bind endogenous COS-7 proteins, such as a protein that migrates somewhat slower than Trio and a ∼180-kDa protein (Fig. 2, upper panel, lanes 4–6, 9, and 10). Taken together, these findings indicate that Trio is a target for RhoA, but not for Rac1 or Cdc42, and that activated RhoA preferentially binds Trio. Attempts to precipitate endogenous Trio with the various GST-tagged GTPases were unsuccessful, probably because of the low level of endogenous Trio present in diverse cell lines (data not shown). To map which region of Trio bound RhoA, a series of Trio amino-terminal truncation mutants (Fig. 1) were co-expressed together with GST-V14RhoA in COS-7 cells, and following metabolic labeling, cell extracts were prepared, and glutathione-Sepharose precipitation was performed (Fig.3 A). GST-V14RhoA bound HA-Trio.GSIK (lane 2), and HA-Trio.SIK (lane 3), but did not efficiently bind HA-Trio·GS (lane 4). Control anti-HA immunoprecipitations of cell extracts used for the glutathione-Sepharose precipitations showed that the expression levels of HA-Trio.GSIK, HA-Trio.SIK, and HA-Trio.GS were comparable (Fig.3 A, lanes 6–8). These results thus indicate that the Trio RhoA-binding site resides in the Trio carboxyl-terminal region (amino acids 2629–3038), which includes the Ig-like domain and the kinase domain. To assess where RhoA bound within the Trio carboxyl-terminal region, HA-tagged Trio constructs encoding both the Ig-like and kinase domains (Trio.IK) or kinase domain alone (Trio·K), were co-expressed with GST-tagged Rho GTPases, and glutathione-Sepharose precipitations were performed (Fig. 3 B). GST-V14RhoA bound Trio.IK but did not bind Trio.K, indicating that the Trio Ig-like domain was required for efficient V14RhoA binding (Fig. 3 B, lane 2). Furthermore, binding studies using a construct encoding only the Trio Ig-like domain (Trio·I) confirmed that GST-V14RhoA bound the Ig-like domain (Fig. 3 C, lane 2). Little if any binding of GST-N19RhoA, -V12Rac1, or -V12Cdc42 was observed with Trio.IK, Trio.I, and Trio.K (Fig. 3, B and C). The HA-tagged Trio.IK, Trio.K, and Trio.I constructs were all efficiently expressed as determined by anti-HA immunoblotting of total lysates (Fig. 3, B and C), as were the GST-Rho GTPases as determined by Coomassie staining (data not shown). To establish whether the Ig-like domain was required for RhoA binding in context of full-length Trio, we created a Trio mutant, TrioΔIg (amino acids 1–2626 and 2717–3038), that lacks only the Ig-like domain and TrioΔC (amino acids 1–2241) that lacks the carboxyl-terminal SH3, Ig-like, and kinase domain (Fig. 1). HA-tagged Trio, TrioΔC, or TrioΔIg were co-expressed together with GST-V14RhoA or GST-N19RhoA in COS-7 cells, and following metabolic labeling, cell extracts were prepared, and glutathione-Sepharose precipitations were performed (Fig. 3 D). GST-V14RhoA bound very little HA-TrioΔIg compared with HA-Trio (Fig. 3 D,lanes 3 and 7), consistent with the Ig-like domain-binding RhoA. Control anti-HA immunoprecipitations using cell extracts showed that the expression levels of Trio, TrioΔC, and TrioΔIg were comparable (Fig. 3 D, lanes 9–16). GST-V14RhoA and -N19RhoA fusion proteins were also efficiently expressed (data not shown). Taken together, the mapping studies demonstrate that the Ig-like domain is the primary RhoA-binding site on Trio and that the Ig-like domain alone is sufficient to bind activated RhoA. Our mapping studies demonstrated that the Trio Ig-like domain is required for efficient binding of RhoA to Trio. However, E. coli-derived V14RhoA did not bind Trio in vitro (data not shown), suggesting that a post-translation modification of RhoA, such as lipid modification, might be required for Trio binding. Consistent with this hypothesis, the binding of GST-V14RhoA to Trio was insensitive to the presence of high NaCl concentrations (up to 1 m NaCl) in the precipitate wash buffer (Fig.4 A), supporting a possible lipid-protein interaction. To test whether RhoA isoprenylation was required for Trio binding, a RhoA cysteine 190 → serine mutant (34Moomaw J.F. Casey P.J. J. Biol.

To this end, GST-V14RhoA-C/S or GST-V14RhoA was co-expressed with HA-tagged Trio.GSIK or with Trio.SIK in COS-7 cells, and following metabolic labeling, cell extracts were prepared, and glutathione-Sepharose precipitations were performed (Fig.4 B). Whereas GST-V14RhoA efficiently bound HA-Trio.GSIK and HA-Trio.SIK (Fig. 4 B, lanes 1 and 3, respectively), the GST-V14RhoA-C/S mutant did not bind HA-Trio.GSIK or Trio.SIK (Fig. 4 B, lanes 2 and 4, respectively). The expression levels of GST-V14RhoA-C/S and GST-V14RhoA were comparable (Fig. 4 B, lanes 1–4), and control anti-HA immunoprecipitations using total cell extracts showed that the expression levels of HA-Trio.GSIK and HA-Trio.SIK were also similar (Fig. 4 B, lanes 5–8). Furthermore, binding experiments using the isolated Ig-like domain construct (Trio·I) with GST-V14RhoA-C/S and GST-V14RhoA also showed a requirement for RhoA isoprenylation (Fig. 4 C). The finding that neither GST-V14RhoA-C/S nor E. coli-derived V14RhoA bound full-length Trio or the isolated Trio Ig-like domain strongly argues that RhoA isoprenylation is required for RhoA binding to Trio.Figure 2Trio binds RhoA. Shown is a SDS-PAGE analysis of [35S]methionine- and [35S]cysteine-labeled proteins isolated by co-precipitation with GST-tagged Rho family GTPases. COS-7 cells were transiently transfected with vectors encoding GST-tagged Rho family GTPases (see top of the figure) with either an expression vector encoding HA-tagged Trio (amino acids 1–3038) (lanes 1–6) or no vector (lanes 7–10). The GST-V14RhoA, -V12Rac1, and -V12Cdc42 constructs harbor mutations that block the GTPase activity, whereas the GST-N19RhoA and -N17Rac1 constructs bind GDP preferentially. Two days after transfection, cells were metabolically labeled, and then cell extracts were prepared, and co-precipitation analysis was performed using glutathione-Sepharose (lanes 1–10, upper panel). As control, 10% of the lysates were used to immunoprecipitate Trio using the anti-HA 12CA5 antibody (lanes 1–6, lower panel). Precipitated proteins were resolved by 6% SDS-PAGE and visualized by autoradiography.

We examined effects of DR-mediated signaling on Ig production from B cells. Cross-linking HLA-DR molecules on B cells by solid-phase anti-HLA-DR monoclonal antibodies, led to an increased production of IgM, without proliferation or apoptosis. This event was accompanied by an enhanced expression of both membrane- and secretory-type IgM heavy chain mRNA. When peptide-pulsed B cells were co-incubated with an HLA-DR-restricted T cell clone treated by the protein synthesis inhibitor emetine, peptide-induced de novo expression of lymphokines and cell-surface molecules on T cells can be neglected. CD40-CD154 interaction was not involved in IgM enhancement, in such a system. The protein-tyrosine kinase inhibitors and the Syk inhibitor piceatannol, but not the Src inhibitor PP2 had a marked inhibitory effect on IgM secretion. Furthermore, ligation of HLA-DR on B cells using the F(ab′)2 fragment of anti-DR monoclonal antibody, enhanced Syk activity. Our data suggest that HLA-DR on B cells not only present antigenic peptides to T cells, but also up-regulate IgM production, in association with Syk activation and without the involvement of Src kinases, hence the possible physiological relevance of Src-independent Syk activation.

Kohrogi H. Ando M. Nishimura Y. Matsushita S. J. Immunol. 1996; 157: 4837-4843PubMed Google Scholar). Thus, signals transmitted to monocytes via HLA molecules are involved in determining immune response patterns. It is highly conceivable that signals transmitted by class II MHC molecules in B cells, in regulating antigen-presenting cell function during cognate T-B cell interactions, are important, for the following reasons: (a) cross-linking class II molecules induces an increase in intracellular calcium and cAMP in mouse or human B cell lines (2Cambier J.C.

Immunol. 1994; 6: 887-896Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar); (d) class II MHC molecules without the intracellular domain expressed on B lymphoma cells will not lead to an increase in cAMP and subsequent CD80 up-regulation, when stimulated with a CD28-expressing autoreactive T hybridoma cells (8Nabavi N.

Bishop G.A. Immunity. 1995; 3: 349-358Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar) and translocation of PKC (10Rich T. Lawler S.E. Lord J.M. Blancheteau V.M. Charron D.J. Mooney N.A. J. Immunol. 1997; 159: 3792-3798PubMed Google Scholar); and (f) cross-linking of HLA-DR molecules expressed on B cells induces phosphorylation of Src family kinases (Lyn, Fgr) (11Morio T. Geha R.S. Chatila T.A. Eur. J. Immunol. 1994; 24: 651-658Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar) and Syk (12Kanner S.B. Grosmaire L.S. Blake J. Schieven G.L. Masewicz S. Odum N. Ledbetter J.A. Tissue Antigens. 1995; 46: 145-154Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). Although functional consequences of such DR-mediated signaling events induced by T cells are largely unknown, these observations do raise the possibility that signaling through class II MHC molecules may affect B cell responses, including Ig secretion, upon TCR-TCR ligand interaction. A number of protein-tyrosine kinases (PTKs) identified in lymphocytes can be classified into cytoplasmic (e.g. Syk, Btk), membrane-binding (e.g. Lyn, Lck, Fyn), and receptor types (e.g. epidermal growth factor receptor, nerve growth factor receptor). In B cells, a number of PTKs acting downstream of B cell receptors (BCRs) and several Fc receptors lead to activation of B cells. Mechanisms for Syk activation have been extensively examined (13Kurosaki T. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 1999; 17: 555-592Crossref PubMed Scopus (368) Google Scholar). Src family kinases first phosphorylate Igα/Igβ ITAMs following BCR engagement, and then Syk is recruited to the doubly-phosphorylated ITAM and is activated by Src family kinases. Activated Syk molecules in B cells function in a manner analogous to ZAP-70 in T cells, and play a crucial role in B cell activation (14Law C.L. Sidorenko S.P. Chandran K.A. Draves K.E. Chan A.C.

Recent studies have also suggested an alternative activating model of Syk that is independent of Src family kinases (16Kolanus W. Romeo C. Seed B.

Peripheral B cells were isolated, using Stemsep Kits (StemCell Technologies Inc., Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada). Briefly, PBMC were freshly prepared from healthy adult donors, using Ficoll-Paque, then were incubated with a mixture of Abs (anti-glycoprotein A, anti-CD3, anti-CD14, anti-CD16, and anti-CD56 Abs). B cells were negatively selected in a magnetic column effluent; the isolated population was >90% CD19-positive (data not shown). All cells were cultured in RPMI 1640 medium (Life Technologies, Inc.) supplemented with 2 mml-glutamine, 100 units/ml penicillin, 100 μg/ml streptomycin, and 10% FCS (Life Technologies, Inc.) in 96-well flat-bottomed culture plates (Falcon, Becton Dickinson, Lincoln Park, NJ). The human B lymphoblastoid cell line LD2B was positively stained with anti-IgM Ab and anti-DR Abs, homozygous forHLA-DRB1*1501-DRB5*0101 and was distributed by the 11th International Histocompatibility Workshop (23Tsuji K. Aizawa M. Sasazuki T. HLA 1991: Proceedings of the 11th International Histocompatibility Workshop and Conference. 1. Oxford University Press, Oxford, United Kingdom1992Google Scholar). Anti-DR mAbs (HU4 and L243), mouse IgG2a, and bovine serum albumin were coated onto 96-well flat-bottomed culture plates for 2 days at 10 μg/ml PBS. After extensive washing of the plates with PBS, B cells were added at 5 × 104 cells/well, and incubated at 37 °C in a CO2 incubator. Culture supernatants were collected on days 0–9, and stored in aliquots at −80 °C until determinations of Ig concentrations. The supernatants for 0–9-day cultures were assayed for IgM by sandwich ELISA; IgM production reached the plateau level on day 5 or day 7 (data not shown). Therefore, 5-day culture experiments were done in the subsequent experiments. To examine B cell proliferation, B cells were cultured for 72 h, in the presence of 1 μCi/well [3H]thymidine during the final 16-h period, and the incorporated radioactivity was measured by liquid scintillation counting. Peripheral B cells were incubated in a 48-well flat-bottomed culture plate in the presence of soluble anti-DR mAb L243 (10 μg/ml), soluble mouse Ig control, or immobilized Igs. After 24-h incubation, cells were examined for phosphatidylserine expression on the cell surface with fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated annexin V and DNA staining with propidium iodide, using the MEBCYTO apoptosis kits (MBL, Nagoya, Japan) and flow cytometry with a FACScan instrument (Becton Dickinson, Mountain View, CA). T cell clone BC20.7 (21Matsushita S. Kohsaka H. Nishimura Y. J.

The cells were re-suspended in culture medium, followed by 3 h of incubation at 37 °C, and then washed three times with RPMI 1640 medium and co-cultured with peptide-pulsed or mock-pulsed B cells prepared from PBMC. Culture supernatants after 5-day incubation were collected and subjected to ELISA. In some experiments, the peptide-pulsed peripheral B cells were cultured for 5 days, with emetine-treated T cells in the presence of kinase inhibitors, at several concentrations. These inhibitors were dissolved in Me2SO and used at concentrations 0.5–25-fold higher than the reported IC50values (25Hanke J.H. Gardner J.P. Dow R.L. Changelian P.S. Brissette W.H. Weringer E.J.

PBMC (1.5 × 105/well) were cultured with IL-4, 1 μmionomycin, and 10 ng/ml PMA with neutralizing anti-human CD154 mAb (Ancell, Bayport, MN) or with control mouse IgG, for 8 days to obtain supernatant fluids, or for 3 days to assess proliferative responses. The supernatant fluids of 8-day culture were assayed for IgE by sandwich ELISA. The peptide-pulsed peripheral B cells were cultured for 5 days, with emetine-treated T cells in the presence of the anti-CD154 mAb or with control mouse IgG, to determine IgM concentrations of the supernatant fluids. After cross-linking DR molecules as described above, total cellular RNA was extracted from 1 × 106 purified B cells by the acid guanidine thiocyanate phenol-chloroform method (TRIzol, Life Technologies, Inc.). The first strand cDNA was synthesized from purified total RNA by reverse transcriptase, using random primers (SuperScript™ preamplification system, Life Technologies, Inc.). The following oligonucleotides were used as primers: 5′-TCGGACATGACCAGGGACAC-3′ (secreted component-origin) and 5′-TTCTCAAAGCCCTCCTCGTC-3′ (membrane component-origin) for secretory-type μ chain and membrane-type μ chain, respectively, and 5′- AAAACCCACACCAACATCTC-3′ (Cμ3-origin) as a common primer. PRDI-BF1 transcripts were amplified using 5′-CTAAGAACGCCAACAGGAAA-3′ and 5′-TGGAGTGGTGGAGGATGGAA-3′. β-Actin transcripts as a control, were amplified using 5′-CGGGAAATCGTGCGTGACAT-3′ and 5′-CTCGTCATACTCCTGCTTGC-3′. One amplification cycle consists of 6 min at 95 °C followed by 20–25 cycles for 1 min at 95 °C, 58 °C for 1 min, and 72 °C for 1.5 min. The final extension cycle was for 7 min at 72 °C. Amplification was performed under conditions in which amplified PCR products were invisible on an agarose gel under UV wave, so that none of amplified DNA concentrations reached a plateau level. PCR products were separated on a 1.2% agarose gel and transferred onto nylon membrane (Zeta-Probe, Bio-Rad), using 0.4 n NaOH. The membrane were hybridized with cDNA probes for Cμ chain (kindly provided by Dr. N. Kondo, Gifu University) (28Kondo N. Ozawa T. Kato Y. Motoyoshi F. Kasahara K. Kameyama T. Orii T. Clin. Exp.

Hybridization signals were analyzed using the public domain Image program (developed at the United States National Institutes of Health and available from the Internet by anonymous FTP from zippy.nimh.nih.gov.). The 96-well plates (ELISA plate H type, Sumitomo Bakelite, Tokyo, Japan) were coated overnight at 4 °C with 0.3–0.5 μg/well anti-IgM mAb (JDC-15, PharMingen), anti-IgG1 mAb (G17-1, PharMingen), anti-IgG2 mAb (HP-6014, Southern Biotechnology Associates), anti-IgG3 mAb (G18-3, PharMingen), anti-IgG4 mAb (G17-4, PharMingen), anti-IgA1/A2 mAb (G18-1, PharMingen), or anti-IgE mAb (G7–18, PharMingen) in PBS, pH 7.2. After washing five times with PBS, the plates were blocked with 1% bovine serum albumin/PBS for 2 h at room temperature. Standard Igs and culture supernatants were added and incubation run 1 h at room temperature. After washing five times with PBS, biotin-conjugated Abs to IgM (G20-127, PharMingen), IgG (G18-145, PharMingen), IgA1/A2 (G20-359, PharMingen), or IgE (A116BN, American Qualex Antibodies), were added to each well. After 1 h of incubation, the plates were washed five times with PBS and streptavidin-alkaline phosphatase (Life Technologies, Inc.) was added. After 1 h, the plates were washed five times with PBS and p-nitrophenyl phosphate (KPL Inc.) as a substrate was added, then were analyzed using an ELISA reader (model 550, Bio-Rad) at 405 nm. The level of cross-reactivity was 833-fold at the maximum, which occurred between IgG1 and IgG3 (data not shown). Peripheral B cells and the human B lymphoblastoid cell line LD2B (5 × 105) were incubated for 10 min on ice and then pre-incubated either with biotinylated anti-DR mAb (40 μg/200 μl) or with biotinylated mouse IgG (40 μg/200 μl) for 10 min on ice. After washing with ice-cold RPMI 1640, the cells were suspended with 50 μl of 10% FCS/RPMI and cross-linked with 50 μl of avidin (1 mg/ml). After 10 min of incubation at 37 °C, ice-cold 100 μmNa3VO4/PBS was added, followed by pelleting and lysing in 50 μl of lysing buffer (150 mm NaCl, 20 mm Tris, pH 7.6, 0.5% Nonidet P-40, 2 mmsodium orthovanadate, 1 mm NaF, 5 mm EDTA, plus a protease inhibitor mixture purchased from Sigma). Supernatant fluids of the lysates were electrophoresed on SDS-PAGE gels and transferred to nitrocellulose membrane. After blocking with 10% skim milk, 0.2% Tween 20 in Tris-buffered saline, the membrane was incubated with the anti-phosphotyrosine mAb 4G10 (Upstate Biotechnology, Inc.), washed extensively, and subjected to chemiluminescence detection with peroxidase-conjugated anti-mouse IgG Ab (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech), using an ECL kit (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). In some experiments, lysates prepared from 1 × 107 LD2B cells were immunoprecipitated with anti-Syk Ab, and subjected to immunoblot analysis with anti-phosphotyrosine mAb 4G10 or anti-Syk Ab. The human B lymphoblastoid cell line LD2B (1 × 107) was incubated for 10 min on ice and then pre-incubated either with biotinylated Igs (40 μg/200 μl) or with biotinylated F(ab′)2 fragments (12 μg/200 μl) for 10 min on ice. After washing with ice-cold RPMI 1640, the cells were suspended with 50 μl of 10% FCS/RPMI and cross-linked with 50 μl of avidin (1 mg/ml). After a 10-min incubation at 37 °C, ice-cold 100 μmNa3VO4/PBS was added, followed by pelleting and lysing in 400 μl of the lysing buffer. Supernatant fluids of the lysates were pre-cleared with Protein A-agarose beads, then were incubated with a rabbit polyclonal anti-Syk Ab (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc.), using Protein A-agarose beads (Pierce). After shaking for 30 min at 4 °C, the beads were washed four times with lysis buffer. An aliquot of immunoprecipitated proteins was eluted with Laemmli buffer containing 2-mercaptoethanol, for immunoblotting analysis. Residual beads were washed once with kinase buffer (25 mm HEPES, pH 7.4, 0.1% (v/v) Nonidet P-40, 10 mm MgCl2, 3 mm MnCl2, 30 μm Na3VO4; Ref. 30Minami Y. Nakagawa Y. Kawahara A. Miyazaki T. Sada K. Yamamura H. Taniguchi T. Immunity. 1995; 2: 89-100Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar) and were re-suspended in 30 μl of the kinase buffer containing 2 μg (0.11 nmol) of MBP (Sigma), in the presence of either 27.5 nmol of HS1 peptide or an irrelevant peptide. Reactions were initiated by adding 3.75 μm [γ-32P]ATP (10 μCi of [γ-32P]ATP/sample, 5000 Ci/mmol; Amersham Pharmacia Biotech), and then incubated for 2.5 min at 25 °C. The reactions were terminated by adding an equal volume of 2× Laemmli buffer. The supernatants were boiled for 2 min and applied to a 12% SDS-PAGE. After electrophoresis, the gel was fixed and vacuum-dried, and analyzed using a bio-imaging analyzer (BAS2000, Fuji Film, Tokyo, Japan). Eluted protein samples were separated on 7.5% SDS-PAGE and transferred to nitrocellulose membrane. After blocking with 10% skim milk, 0.2% Tween 20 in Tris-buffered saline, the membrane was incubated with the rabbit anti-Syk Ab, washed extensively, and subjected to chemiluminescence detection with peroxidase-conjugated anti-rabbit IgG Ab (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc.), using an ECL kit (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). To test whether signals via class II HLA molecules would affect production of Igs, we first cross-linked class II HLA molecules on B cells by making use of anti-DR mAb-coated culture plates. The supernatant fluids of 5-day cultures were assayed for Ig concentrations, among which only IgM was markedly affected by DR ligation. As shown in Fig.1 A, cross-linking DR molecules with anti-DR mAbs (L243 or HU4) on B cells induced IgM production, whereas isotype-matched mouse IgG did not do so, thereby indicating that signals transmitted by FcR are not involved. The experiment was repeated six times with reproducible results. Similar results were obtained, using B cells from another subject carrying DRB1*1405/1502 (data not shown). To rule out the possibility that IgM production relates to B cell proliferation induced by signals via DR molecules (31Cambier J.C. Lehmann K.R. J. Exp. Med. 1989; 170: 877-886Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar, 32Mourad W. Scholl P. Diaz A. Geha R. Chatila T. J. Exp. Med. 1989; 170: 2011-2022Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar), B cells were cultured for 3 days in culture plates coated with anti-DR mAbs, in the presence of [3H]thymidine during the final 16 h. As shown in Fig. 1 B, no difference was observed between proliferative response induced by anti-DR mAbs and that induced by controls. This was also the case in the 6-day culture experiments (data not shown). Proliferative responses of the same B cell preparation induced by PMA and ionomycin exhibited 7,164 cpm. To exclude the possibility that the increase in IgM is due to apoptosis of B cells, we cross-linked DR on B cells with the soluble form or solid-phase anti-DR mAbs. Stimulation with soluble-form (Fig.2 B), but not solid-phase mAb (Fig. 2 D) and controls (Fig. 2, A andC), induced marked apoptosis. The precise mechanisms for this discrepancy is yet to be determined, but it is conceivable that DR-mediated increase in IgM in the culture supernatants was not due to release of IgM from apoptotic B cells. These observations collectively indicate that increased IgM concentration in culture supernatant fluids cannot be ascribed to B cell proliferation or apoptosis. To determine whether signals via DR molecules up-regulate μ chain mRNA, we cross-linked DR molecules on peripheral B cells (1 × 106) with either solid-phase anti-DR mAb (L243) or solid-phase mouse IgG. Due to limitations in the number of purified B cells, we could test only three samples at one time. At 0, 3, and 6 h (Fig. 3 A), or 6, 12, and 24 h (Fig. 3 B) after the initiation of culture, B cells were analyzed for mRNA expression for μ chains, using RT-PCR and Southern blot analysis. Relative mRNA level was analyzed, using the public domain NIH Image program. When we tested the kinetics, μ chain mRNA increased in a time-dependent fashion (Fig. 3 A) and reached maximum at 12 h (Fig.3 B). This increase was not due to the enhanced recovery of mRNA, as evidenced by the presence of an equal amount of β-actin mRNA in each sample. The μ chain mRNA level induced by control mouse IgG at 3, 6, 12, and 24 h was practically the same as that induced by anti-DR mAbs at 0 h (data not shown). To test whether the DR-generated signal induced differentiation of B cells to plasma cells, we analyzed PRDI-BF1 transcripts. PRDI-BF1 is a human homologue of Blimp-1, the expression of which is characteristic of late B cells and plasma cells (29Keller A.D. Maniatis T. Genes Dev. 1991; 5: 868-879Crossref PubMed Scopus (268) Google Scholar, 33Turner Jr., C.A. Mack D.H. Davis M.M. Cell. 1994; 77: 297-306Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (633) Google Scholar, 34Huang S. Cell. 1994; 78: 9Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). However, as shown in Fig. 3, DR-generated signals up-regulated no mRNA for PRDI-BF1. The presence of PRDI-BF1 transcripts is indicative of the presence of plasma cells in this cell preparation. The experiment was repeated twice with reproducible results. These data suggest that IgM production induced by cross-linking of DR molecules is regulated at the mRNA level and is not associated with B cell differentiation to plasma cells. Although earlier observations strongly suggest that the ligation of HLA-DR molecules directly stimulates B cells to produce IgM, the outcome of ligation by mAbs should be affected by epitopes recognized by these mAbs and their affinity. Indeed, anti-HLA-DR mAb HU-4, exerted weaker effects than did L243 (Fig. 1). It is unlikely that HLA-DRB4 molecules recognized by L243 are transmitting the signals, because the B cell donor in Figs. 1and 3 did not carry DRB4-positive haplotypes. Therefore, we next asked if a similar phenomenon occurs, on natural TCR-peptide-HLA interactions. An HLA-DR-restricted T cell clone was treated with thede novo protein synthesis inhibitor emetine (24Weaver C.T. Unanue E.R. J. Immunol. 1986; 137: 3868-3873PubMed Google Scholar), because it is highly likely that T cell membrane proteins or T cell soluble factors newly synthesized after activation by peptide-pulsed B cells, work on B cells. Under conditions where T cells are treated with 90 μg/ml emetine for 1 h, followed by co-culture with peptide-pulsed B cells bearing restriction HLA molecules, T cells produced <25 pg/ml IL-4, whereas non-treated T cells produced 3580 pg/ml IL-4, although cell-surface TCR remains practically the same level (data not shown), indicating that de novo protein synthesis of T cells is abrogated by emetine. A T cell clone BC20.7 (BCGa-specific, DR14-restricted) and B cells purified from PBMC of the donor of BC20.7 were used in subsequent experiments. As shown in TableI, levels of IgM, IgG1, IgG4, IgE, and IgA were detected when mock-pulsed B cells were co-cultured with emetine-treated T cells. However, when B cells were pre-pulsed with the antigenic peptide, marked enhancement of IgM and marginal enhancement of IgA production were observed and such was not the case when peptide-pulsed B cells were cultured in the absence of T cells (data not shown). The experiment was repeated four times with reproducible results.Table IIg production from B cells induced by a DR-restricted T cell clonePeptideIgMIgG1IgG2IgG3IgG4IgEIgAng/ml−37.5124.5<3.1<3.13.1331.2480+223.596.0<3.1<3.11.4121.2980B cells either mock-pulsed or pulsed with BCGap84–100 were cultured with an HLA-DR14 (DRB1*1405)-restricted and emetine-treated T cell clone BC20.7 for 5 days.

B cells were purified by, and the T cell clone was established from, a donor carrying DRB1*1405/1502. Mean values of duplicate determinations are indicated. S.D. was less than 25%. It seems reasonable to speculate that DR-mediated signals alone can up-regulate IgM production from B cells, based on the following observations made in the current study. (a) Ligation of DR molecules by mAb in the absence of T cells can up-regulate IgM protein and mRNA (Figs. 1 and 3); (b) up-regulation of accessory molecules such as CD154 is not observed in emetine-treated T cells (data not shown); and (c) activated T cells of irrelevant restriction HLA molecules cannot stimulate peptide-pulsed B cells to up-regulate IgM (data not shown). However, we directly confirmed that signals via CD40 molecules are not involved in IgM production from B cells during cognate T-B cell interactions. To determine a saturating concentration of neutralizing anti-human CD154 mAb, we stimulated PBMC with 20 units/ml human recombinant IL-4, 1 μm ionomycin, and"
https://openalex.org/W2024805497,"Time-resolved fluorescence experiments were carried out on a variety of apomyoglobins with one or two tryptophan (Trp) residues located at invariant positions 7 and 14 in the primary sequence. In all cases, the Trp fluorescence kinetics were resolved adequately into two discrete lifetime domains, and decay-associated spectra (DAS) were obtained for each decay component. The DAS resolved for unfolded proteins were indistinguishable by position of the emission maxima and the spectral shapes. The folded proteins revealed noticeable differences in the DAS, which relate to the diverse local environments around the Trp residues in the individual proteins. Furthermore, the DAS of wild-type protein possessing two Trp residues were simulated well by that of one Trp mutants either in the native, molten globule, or unfolded states. Overall, employing Trp fluorescence and site-directed mutagenesis allowed us to highlight the conformational changes induced by the single amino acid replacement and generate novel structural information on equilibrium folding intermediates. Specifically, it was found that conformational fluctuations in the local cluster around the evolutionarily conserved Trp14 are very similar in the native and molten globule states of apomyoglobins. This result indicates that residues in the E and B helices contributing to this cluster are most likely involved in the stabilization of the overall architecture of the structured molten globule intermediate.

This result indicates that residues in the E and B helices contributing to this cluster are most likely involved in the stabilization of the overall architecture of the structured molten globule intermediate. apomyoglobin decay-associated spectra Fluorescence methods have evolved into a powerful tool for studies of biological macromolecules (1Eftink M.R. Shastry M.C.R. Methods Enzymol. 1997; 278: 258-286Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar, 2Morawetz H. J. Polym. Sci. A Polym. Chem. 1999; 37: 1725-1735Crossref Scopus (61) Google Scholar). Intrinsic protein fluorescence, using tryptophan (Trp) as a reporter, provides a sensitive measure of protein tertiary structure and is widely used in protein folding studies (3Ballew R.M. Zabelko J. Gruebele M. Nature Struct. Biol. 1996; 3: 923-926Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar, 4Eaton W.A. Munoz V. Thompson P.A. Chan C.K. Hofrichter J. Curr. Opin. Struct. Biol. 1997; 7: 10-14Crossref PubMed Scopus (187) Google Scholar, 5Park S.-H. Shastry M.C.R. Roder H. Nature Struct. Biol. 1999; 6: 943-947Crossref PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar). Most proteins, however, possess multiple Trp residues and the overall protein emission, naturally, yields only average information on the protein structure. To extract and evaluate the contribution of each reporter, and thereby track the conformational changes occurring in different parts of the macromolecule is a difficult challenge. Site-directed mutagenesis facilitates these studies by targeting individual Trp residues. Clearly, the replacement of a Trp residue by another non-fluorescent amino acid may help to decompose the intrinsic protein fluorescence into the contributions of each reporter (6Pokalsky C. Wick P. Harms E. Lytle F.E. Van Etten R.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 3809-3815Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar, 7Meagher J.L. Beechem J.M. Olson S.T. Gettins P.G.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 23283-23289Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). A major concern, however, relates to the structural similarity of a natural protein and its designed analog. Indeed, some residues within the protein structure might be forced to occupy alternate, “tense” conformations (8Dill K.A. Biochemistry. 1985; 24: 1501-1509Crossref PubMed Scopus (1094) Google Scholar). As a consequence, a point mutation can result in conformational changes either by adjustment of side chain spatial orientations (9Chang Y. Zajicel J. Castellino F.J. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 7652-7663Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar), by shuffling conformational microstates toward a population which is less tense (10Sillen A. Hennecke J. Roethlisberger D. Glockshuber R. Engelborghs Y. Proteins. 1999; 37: 253-263Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar), or by long-distance structural repercussions on the backbone (11Tanio M. Inoue K. Yokota K. Seki T. Tuzi S. Needleman R. Lanyi J.K. Naito A. Saito H. Biophys. J. 1999; 77: 431-442Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). The fluorescence of the remaining reporter could be affected by these induced changes, which, in any case, need to be evaluated. The present study addresses these issues, using apomyoglobin (apoMb)1 proteins as examples. Apomyoglobin, i.e. heme-free myoglobin, is a small, single domain α-helical protein, which has been intensively studied over the last few decades by a plethora of biochemical and biophysical techniques (12Barrick D. Baldwin R.L. Protein Sci. 1993; 2: 869-876Crossref PubMed Scopus (198) Google Scholar). The structure of native apoMb is very similar to that of native holomyoglobin (13Hughson F.M. Wright P.E. Baldwin R.L. Science. 1990; 249: 1544-1548Crossref PubMed Scopus (717) Google Scholar, 14Lecomte J.T.J. Sukits S.F. Bhattacharya S. Falzone C. Protein Sci. 1999; 8: 1484-1491Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar, 15Cocco M.J. Lecomte J.T. Biochemistry. 1990; 29: 11067-11072Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar) and the differences in linear dimension of the native apo- and holo-forms are below 12% (16Kataoka M. Nishii I. Fujisawa T. Ueki T. Tokunaga F. Goto Y. J. Mol. Biol. 1995; 249: 215-228Crossref PubMed Scopus (205) Google Scholar). Taken together, all the available information on (apo)myoglobins contribute to the widespread use of these proteins as model systems in protein folding studies. First, over 700 primary amino acid sequences reported for the myoglobin family provide a sound data base for studies relating protein sequence to chemical and physical properties (17Ptitsyn O.B. Ting K.L.H. J. Mol. Biol. 1999; 291: 671-682Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar). Second, mutagenesis of myoglobin is well established and allows one to make any requisite amino acid replacements (18Springer A. Sligar S.G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1987; 84: 8961-8965Crossref PubMed Scopus (330) Google Scholar, 19Hughson F.M. Baldwin R.L. Biochemistry. 1989; 28: 4415-4422Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar, 20Kay M.S. Baldwin R.L. Nature Struct. Biol. 1996; 3: 439-445Crossref PubMed Scopus (177) Google Scholar, 21Sirangelo I. Tavassi S. Irace G. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2000; 1476: 173-180Crossref PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar). Third, experimental conditions to populate a particular equilibrium state (i.e.native, molten globule, unfolded) of apoMb have been worked out (22Barrick D. Baldwin R.L. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 3790-3796Crossref PubMed Scopus (232) Google Scholar) and biophysical characterization of these states has been reported (12Barrick D. Baldwin R.L. Protein Sci. 1993; 2: 869-876Crossref PubMed Scopus (198) Google Scholar). Most mammalian myoglobins contain two Trp residues at invariant positions 7 and 14 in the amino acid sequence. Both residues reside on the A-helix in the three-dimensional folded structure (Fig.1). Several attempts to separate the individual Trp contributions to the protein emission have been carried out, either using various quenchers and perturbing reagents (23Postnikova G.V. Komarov Y.E. Yumakova E.M. Eur. J. Biochem. 1991; 198 (, and references therein): 223-232Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar, 24Irace G. Balestrieri C. Parlato G. Servillo L. Colonna G.

Gratton E. Biochemistry. 1989; 28: 1508-1512Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar), or other apoMbs with various Trp locations (27Staniforth R.A. Bigotti M.G. Cutruzzola F. Allocatelli C.T. Brunori M. J. Mol. Biol. 1998; 275 (, and references therein): 133-148Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar, 28Anderson S., R. Brunori M. Weber G. Biochemistry. 1970; 9: 4723-4729Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). For native apoproteins it was observed that Trp7 is more accessible to solvent than Trp14 (23Postnikova G.V. Komarov Y.E. Yumakova E.M. Eur. J. Biochem. 1991; 198 (, and references therein): 223-232Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). This result agrees well with the large body of structural data on myoglobins (29Evans S.V. Brayer G.D. J. Mol. Biol. 1990; 213: 885-897Crossref PubMed Scopus (266) Google Scholar, 30Johnson K.A. Olson J.S. Phillips Jr., G.N. J. Mol. Biol. 1989; 207: 459-463Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar, 31Lattman E.E. Nockolds C.E. Kretsinger R.H. Love W. J. Mol. Biol. 1971; 60: 271-277Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). The data relating to the buried Trp14 are less clear, and the reported emission maxima cover a 10-nm range (23Postnikova G.V. Komarov Y.E. Yumakova E.M. Eur. J. Biochem. 1991; 198 (, and references therein): 223-232Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar, 24Irace G. Balestrieri C. Parlato G. Servillo L. Colonna G.

Serious questions remain as to the contributions of each Trp residue to the intrinsic fluorescence. For instance, both a lack of Trp7 emission (23Postnikova G.V. Komarov Y.E. Yumakova E.M. Eur. J. Biochem. 1991; 198 (, and references therein): 223-232Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar, 24Irace G. Balestrieri C. Parlato G. Servillo L. Colonna G. Biochemistry. 1981; 20: 792-799Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar) and coequal contributions from both Trp residues (32Wasylewski Z. Poloczek H. Wasniowska A. Eur. J. Biochem. 1988; 172: 719-724Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar) have been reported for native apoproteins. With respect to the other conformational states, a few experiments with benign modifications suggested that the emission of Trp7 dominates in the molten globule state (pH 4.2),i.e. exhibits twice the amplitude of that of Trp14 (23Postnikova G.V. Komarov Y.E. Yumakova E.M. Eur. J. Biochem. 1991; 198 (, and references therein): 223-232Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar, 24Irace G. Balestrieri C. Parlato G. Servillo L. Colonna G. Biochemistry. 1981; 20: 792-799Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). As to the mutagenesis substituting the indolic residue with a phenylalanine, prior studies reported both a lack of structural changes (21Sirangelo I. Tavassi S. Irace G. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2000; 1476: 173-180Crossref PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar, 33Sirangelo I. Bismuto E. Tavassi S. Irace G. Eur. Biophys. J. 1998; 27: 27-31Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar) and perturbation of the native structure due to this replacement (20Kay M.S. Baldwin R.L. Nature Struct. Biol. 1996; 3: 439-445Crossref PubMed Scopus (177) Google Scholar). Clearly, a better understanding of the factors that determine the Trp fluorescence in apoMbs is required to take full advantage of this information. We therefore initiated a study aimed at dissecting the individual Trp contributions using myoglobin variants with desired replacements. Natural proteins were sperm whale and horse myoglobins containing two Trp residues at positions 7 and 14, along with tuna myoglobin possessing only a single Trp14. Two specifically engineered proteins were sperm whale myoglobins with only Trp7 or only Trp14and the other Trp residue replaced by phenylalanine. As a technique we employed time-resolved fluorescence spectroscopy utilizing the Trp residue as an intrinsic spectroscopic probe. Indeed, fluorescence resolved on the nanosecond scale provides information on both macromolecular structure and dynamics, including the fluctuation of the microenvironment of the reporter, rearrangement of the intra- and inter-macromolecular interactions, rotational diffusion of the chain segments, etc. Using tryptophan as a reporter offers an ideal means to monitor protein folding mainly due to the high sensitivity of the indole fluorescence to the polarity of the environment. Together with steady state fluorescence experiments and site-directed mutagenesis this allowed us to explore the structural changes occurring in different parts of the protein during equilibrium (un)folding, as well as highlight the effects of single amino acid replacement on the protein structure. Individual Trp contributions to the total apoMb emission are assessed and a correlation between the Trp fluorescence and structural features of the native, molten globule, and unfolded states of apoMb is discussed in the context of interactions between the individual Trp residues and neighboring residues in local structural clusters.Figure 1Ribbon representation of native apomyoglobin displaying the tryptophan residues 7 and 14 residing on the A helix.

Site-directed mutagenesis of sperm whale myoglobin was carried out as described previously (18Springer A. Sligar S.G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1987; 84: 8961-8965Crossref PubMed Scopus (330) Google Scholar, 19Hughson F.M. Baldwin R.L. Biochemistry. 1989; 28: 4415-4422Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar, 20Kay M.S. Baldwin R.L.

Acta. 1959; 35: 543Crossref PubMed Scopus (1063) Google Scholar) followed by gel chromatography on Sephadex G-25 (PD-10 columns, Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). The apoproteins were extensively dialyzed against water at 4 °C and lyophilized for storage. Contamination of the apoprotein by myoglobin was assessed spectrophotometrically; no significant absorption was observed in the Soret region. Homogeneity of the apoMb was verified by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (36Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (207233) Google Scholar); a single band was observed for each sample. Protein concentration was estimated by absorbance at 280 nm with a Hewlett-Packard 8452A diode array spectrophotometer. The molar extinction at 280 nm was calculated from the tryptophan and tyrosine composition and the standard values of 5690 and 1280 m−1 cm−1 reported for those amino acids (37Gill S.C. von Hippel P.H. Anal. Biochem. 1989; 182: 319-326Crossref PubMed Scopus (5060) Google Scholar). All reagents were of reagent grade or better. Ultra-pure urea was purchased from ICN (Irvine, CA) and used without further purification. Experiments were carried out at room temperature in a 10 mm sodium acetate, 10 mmsodium phosphate buffer mixture, containing 30 mm NaCl. The protein concentration was 6 μm unless stated. The native and molten globule states were studied at pH 6.5 and 4.2, respectively (22Barrick D. Baldwin R.L. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 3790-3796Crossref PubMed Scopus (232) Google Scholar). The unfolded state was achieved by addition of 8 murea to the native protein solution. Fluorescence emission spectra were recorded on a SPEX Fluorolog-2 spectrofluorometer (data interval of 0.5 nm, scan speed of 50 nm/min) supplied with DM-3000 software. Emission was measured under “magic angle” conditions in the ratio mode and corrected for the appropriate solvent blanks, as well as for wavelength-dependent bias of the optics and detection system. An excitation wavelength of 295 nm was used in all experiments to avoid tyrosine absorbance. Fluorescence intensity decay measurements were performed using the time-correlated single-photon counting setup essentially as described in Ref. 38Tcherkasskaya O. Ptitsyn O.B. Knutson J.R. Biochemistry. 2000; 39 (, and references therein): 1879-1889Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar. Samples were excited at 295 nm using a synchronously purged, cavity dumped, frequency doubled dye laser (repetition rate of 4 MHz, pulse width of 5 ps, average UV power <200 μW). The channel width was 85 ps, and the data were collected in 512 channels. The instrumental time resolution limited by the detector (R955 photomultiplier) had a transit time spread of 900 ps. This allows one to resolve correlation times as short as 150 ps. Some samples were re-measured with a microchannel plate photomultiplier with a resolution approaching 50 ps (total optical and electronic transit time spread of 120 ps). This improvement in resolution, however, led to no changes in the recovered parameters. Fluorescence intensity decay surfaces were collected under magic angle conditions for equal dwell times and by stepping the emission monochromator in increments of 5 nm in the range of 300–450 nm. One complete measurement included the fluorescence intensity decay of the reference compound, the sample, the background, and again the reference. Reproducibility of the experimental data was found to be satisfactory as judged by the results of duplicate experiments. In all experiments the reference lamp profile and color shift used for convolution analysis was tested with a monoexponential standard (melatonin aqueous solution with τfl = 5.2 ns). Finally, over 30 decays were obtained for each sample and further used for the global analysis. In particular, the fluorescence intensity decay was assumed to follow a multiexponential law:l(t,λ)=∑inαi(λ)e−t/τiEquation 1 where the relative amplitudes, αi, and the decay constants, τi, were the numerical parameters to be recovered. Decay-associated spectra were obtained from a global fit of the decay profiles collected at different wavelengths with the common lifetimes τi linked across the data set while optimizing the amplitudes αi for each decay (39Knutson J.R. Beechem J.M. Brand L. Chem. Phys. Lett. 1983; 102: 501-507Crossref Scopus (545) Google Scholar). To resolve the emission spectra associated with the individual decay constants, the fluorescence intensities at various wavelengths were expressed as ατ products. The relative contribution of each decay component to the total emission, f i, was calculated asfi=τi∑λαi(λ)∑iτi∑λαi(λ)Equation 2 The convolution was compared with the experimental decay by nonlinear least-squares analysis. The best fit between the theoretical curve and the data was evaluated from the plot of weighted residuals, the autocorrelation function of the weighted residuals, and the reduced χR 2 value. In all cases, a short-lived, fixed component was employed to compensate for any scattered excitation or color shift. The confidence limits for DAS have been explored previously (40Boens N. Janssens L.D. Ameloot M. DeSchryver F.C. Lakowicz J.R. Time-resolved Laser Spectroscopy in Biochemistry II. Bellingham, WA1990: 456-467Google Scholar); and for our experimental conditions, we anticipate that fluorescence parameters will be recovered within 10%. Fluorescence intensity decays were recorded for each sample as a function of wavelength across the emission spectrum from 300 to 450 nm. Over 1000 decays were collected for a variety of conditions, which include native, molten globule and unfolded proteins, and variation of the solvent (e.g. addition of sucrose). Overall, the Trp fluorescence was described adequately with a two-exponential model for both one and two Trp proteins. The reduced χR 2 value, characterizing the goodness of the fit, was always less than 1.5, and the weighted residuals and the autocorrelation of the residuals were randomly distributed around zero. Attempted fits of the experimental data to a one-exponential model showed a substantial (>30%) increase in χR 2 value. A three-exponential fit led to no improvement in χR 2 and generated the third term with rather short (∼0.5 ns) or large (>7 ns) lifetimes. Since the emission (ατ) as well as the relative amplitude (α) associated with this additional term were always comparable to the experimental accuracy, the simpler two-exponential model was chosen for further consideration. Parameters associated with the time-resolved fluorescence in apoMb natural variants and site-directed mutants are summarized in Table I. The decay-associated spectra resolved for two- and one-Trp proteins are shown in Figs. 2 and3. To emphasize the difference in DAS generated for a particular sample, the spectra were normalized and displayed in the inset. The blue, green, andred colors refer to the native, molten globule, and unfolded states, respectively.Table IParameters associated with time-resolved fluorescence of tryptophan in apomyoglobinsProtein SourceShort-lived componentLong-lived component〈τ〉 1-aMean decay time 〈τ〉 = Σαiτi.

Open table in a new tab The error in the values of recovered parameters is about 10%, as been estimated through the statistical analysis (see “Experimental Procedures”) and the results of replication. Figs. 2 and 3 demonstrate vividly that unfolded proteins (red curves) yielded two-component DAS, which exhibit similar positions of emission maxima (λmax ∼ 347 nm) and spectral shape. Variation of solvent viscosity, i.e. the addition of sucrose up to 23 wt %, showed no significant effect on the time-resolved fluorescence as evidenced by the data presented in Figs. 2 C. Hence, the complex fluorescence kinetics observed for Trp residues in the unfolded proteins cannot be explained by the effect of solvent relaxation alone (41Demchenko A.P. Lakowicz J.R. Topics in Fluorescence Spectroscopy. 3. Plenum Press, New York1991: 65-112Google Scholar). In fact, the strong similarity in DAS recovered for the entire set of samples hints at common features of the electronic relaxation of the indolic residue in the unfolded polypeptide chains. In contrast, the DAS recorded for folded proteins exhibited noticeable differences, which might relate to the specific local interactions between the Trp residues and neighboring amino acids in a local structural cluster. Fig. 2, A and B, show the DAS of natural proteins containing two Trp residues, when measured in the native (blue curves) and molten globule (green curves) states. Considering native apoMb from sperm whale as an example (Fig. 2 A), one observes that the spectrum associated with the short-lived decay component (τfl = 1.3 ns) constitutes the major contribution (f ∼ 64%) to the total emission, and exhibits a maximum at ∼330 nm. The spectrum associated with the long-lived component (τfl = 4.1 ns) provides a minor contribution (f ≈ 36%) and has an emission maximum at ∼335 nm. These data correspond well to those reported previously (42Eftink M.R. Wasylewsky Z. Chiron C.A. Biochemistry. 1987; 26: 8338-8346Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar, 43Janes S.M. Holtom G. Ascenzi P. Brunori M. Hochstrasser R.M. Biophys. J. 1987; 51: 653-660Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). Quite similar DAS were obtained for native apoMb from horse (Fig. 2 B). In fact, the visual difference in DAS generated for these variants arises from only small deviations in the recovered decay parameters (Table I). However, slight variations in the folded structures of these proteins were previously observed by high-resolution diffraction methods (29Evans S.V. Brayer G.D. J. Mol. Biol. 1990; 213: 885-897Crossref PubMed Scopus (266) Google Scholar). Importantly, the contribution of the short-lived component to the total decay αshort(see Equation 1) in both native proteins is about 80%, and the two-component DAS are separated by 5 nm. Furthermore, both proteins show similar changes in DAS when adopting the molten globule state. The spectrum of the new long-lived component (τfl ≈ 5.5 ns) centered at 335 nm becomes dominant in emission and the apparent population of short-lived species is reduced to 50%. Fig. 3 displays the DAS generated for proteins containing only a single Trp residue. Altogether, DAS resolved for Trp14 under native conditions are indistinguishable by spectral shape and the position of emission maximum at ∼330 nm (Fig. 3, A andC). In contrast, spectra of the Trp7 are clearly separated by 5 nm with the maxima located at ∼330 and ∼335 nm (Fig.3 B). Furthermore, one-Trp proteins exhibit different changes in DAS when adopting the molten globule state. Specifically, no changes in DAS were observed for Trp14, indicating the absence of any dynamic changes in the local environments of this residue. The fluorescence of the Trp7, however, changes substantially and a new long-lived component (τfl = 5.7 ns) becomes dominant in the emission of the molten globules. The spectra resolved for the Trp7 in the molten globule state are still separated by 5 nm. Surprisingly, the folded proteins containing only Trp14 show considerable differences in time-resolved fluorescence. For instance, the emission of the native apoMb from tuna (Fig. 3 C) derives the largest contribution from the long-lived decay component (τfl = 5.2 ns), whereas the fluorescence of Trp14 in the sperm whale mutant (Fig.3 A) is dominated by the short-lived component (τfl = 1.3 ns). Both samples, however, exhibit DAS, which are indistinguishable by the positions of the emission maxima or spectral shape, and are not appreciably affected by the native-molten globule transition.

https://openalex.org/W2026118407,"In this study, we present the location of the ferredoxin-binding site in photosystem I from spinach. Image analysis of negatively stained two-dimensional crystals indicates that the addition of ferredoxin and chemical cross-linkers do not significantly alter the unit cell parameters (for untreated photosystem I, a = 26.4 nm, b = 27.6 nm, and gamma = 90 degrees, space group p22(1)2(1) and for ferredoxin cross-linked photosystem I, a = 26.2 nm, b = 27.2 nm, and gamma = 90 degrees, space group p22(1)2(1)). Fourier difference analysis reveals that ferredoxin is bound on top of the stromal ridge principally interacting with the extrinsic subunits PsaC and PsaE. This location would be accessible to the stroma, thereby promoting efficient electron transfer away from photosystem I. This observation is significantly different from that of the ferredoxin binding site proposed for cyanobacteria. A model for the binding of ferredoxin in vascular plants is proposed and is discussed relative to observations in cyanobacteria."
https://openalex.org/W2017507984,"Stimulation of RBL-2H3 m1 mast cells through the IgE receptor with antigen, or through a G protein-coupled receptor with carbachol, leads to the rapid appearance of phosphothreonine in nonmuscle myosin heavy chain II-A (NMHC-IIA). We demonstrate that this results from phosphorylation of Thr-1940 by calcium/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase II (CaM kinase II), activated by increased intracellular calcium. The phosphorylation site in rodent NMHC-IIA was localized to the carboxyl terminus of NMHC-IIA distal to the coiled-coil region, and identified as Thr-1940 by site-directed mutagenesis. A fusion protein containing the NMHC-IIA carboxyl terminus was phosphorylated by CaM kinase II in vitro, while mutation of Thr-1940 to Ala eliminated phosphorylation. In contrast to rodents, in humans Thr-1940 is replaced by Ala, and human NMHC-IIA fusion protein was not phosphorylated by CaM kinase II unless Ala-1940 was mutated to Thr. Similarly, co-transfected Ala → Thr-1940 human NMHC-IIA was phosphorylated by activated CaM kinase II in HeLa cells, while wild type was not. In RBL-2H3 m1 cells, inhibition of CaM kinase II decreased Thr-1940 phosphorylation, and inhibited release of the secretory granule marker hexosaminidase in response to carbachol but not to antigen. These data indicate a role for CaM kinase stimulation and resultant threonine phosphorylation of NMHC-IIA in RBL-2H3 m1 cell activation. Stimulation of RBL-2H3 m1 mast cells through the IgE receptor with antigen, or through a G protein-coupled receptor with carbachol, leads to the rapid appearance of phosphothreonine in nonmuscle myosin heavy chain II-A (NMHC-IIA).

One of the responses to these signals is the fusion of secretory granules with the plasma membrane, allowing release of preformed mediators such as histamine and serotonin from the cell. Calcium and PKC are necessary and sufficient for secretion in permeabilized cells (4Ozawa K. Szallasi Z. Kazanietz M.G. Blumberg P.M. Mischak H. Mushinski J.F. Beaven M.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 1749-1756Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Fusion of the secretory granules with the plasma membrane is accompanied by cytoskeletal rearrangements, which may facilitate fusion by removing a barrier of actomyosin which physically separates the two entities. Previous work has demonstrated that activation of the rat mast cell line RBL-2H3 with antigen or with calcium ionophore leads to the rapid PKC-dependent serine phosphorylation of nonmuscle myosin on both light chains and heavy chains (5Ludowyke R.I. Peleg I. Beaven M.A. Adelstein R.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 12492-12501Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The phosphorylation of nonmuscle myosin heavy chain (NMHC)-II, which occurs close to the carboxyl terminus at the end of the coiled-coil region, has been proposed to contribute to rearrangement of the actomyosin cytoskeleton and thus facilitate secretory granule fusion at the plasma membrane and resultant mediator release (5Ludowyke R.I. Peleg I. Beaven M.A. Adelstein R.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 12492-12501Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar).Recent studies in a variety of cell lines have demonstrated that NMHC-II can also be threonine phosphorylated in response to stimuli. In rat PC12 cells, NMHC-II phosphorylation in response to bradykinin was shown to be calcium-dependent, and was regulated by activity of the small GTPase Rac. NMHC-II phosphorylation was accompanied by loss of cortical myosin (6van Leeuwen F.N. van Delft S. Kain H.E. van der Kammen R.A. Collard J.G. Nat Cell Biol. 1999; 1: 242-248Crossref PubMed Scopus (183) Google Scholar). Calcium-dependent phosphorylation of NMHC-II was also shown in response to nutrient stimulation in the rat insulinoma cell line RINm5F, and was proposed to play a role in insulin secretion (7Wilson J.R. Biden T.J. Ludowyke R.I. Diabetes. 1999; 48: 2383-2389Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). However, in neither study was the site of threonine phosphorylation of the myosin heavy chain determined. In light of these findings, it was of interest to determine whether threonine phosphorylation of NMHC-II also occurs in mast cells. Here we demonstrate that stimulation of RBL-2H3 m1 cells, an RBL-2H3 cell line made to express the muscarinic m1 receptor (8Jones S.V. Choi O.H. Beaven M.A. FEBS Lett. 1991; 289: 47-50Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar), with antigen or carbachol leads to calcium-dependent threonine phosphorylation of NMHC-IIA. We provide evidence that Thr-1940, situated distal to the coiled-coil region within a CaM kinase consensus sequence, is the residue phosphorylated. We also demonstrate that CaM kinase II is activated by antigen and carbachol with time courses similar to those obtained for NMHC-IIA threonine phoshorylation. Finally, a specific inhibitor of CaM kinase attenuates threonine phosphorylation of NMHC-IIA, and also inhibits secretion in response to carbachol.MATERIALS AND METHODSRBL-2H3 m1 cells and Y79 cells were generously provided by Drs.

Yamakawa K. Adelstein R.S. J. Muscle Res. Cell Motil. 1995; 16: 379-389Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar). A rabbit polyclonal antibody raised against 13 amino acid residues at the amino terminus of human NMHC-IIA was kindly provided by Dr. Mary Anne Conti (NHLBI). Anti-GFP was obtained fromCLONTECH (Palo Alto, CA). 4–20% SDS-polyacrylamide gels were obtained from FMC (Rockland, ME), while 4–12% NuPAGE gels were obtained from Novex (San Diego, CA). A synthetic peptide corresponding to amino acids 1933–1951 of rat NMHC-IIA was obtained from Research Genetics (Huntsville, AL).Antigen Stimulation of Mast CellsRBL-2H3 cells were incubated overnight with anti-dinitrophenol IgE (0.5 μg/ml), washed with phosphate-buffered saline, and the medium replaced with DMEM containing 0.1% BSA. Cells were then stimulated with DNP-BSA (20 ng/ml), washed twice with ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline containing 5 mm EDTA and 1 mm sodium vanadate, lysis buffer added, and the cells scraped from the plate with a plastic scraper. Lysis buffer consisted of 25 mm Hepes, pH 7.5, 0.3m NaCl, 1.5 mm MgCl2, 0.1% Triton X-100, 1 mm sodium orthovanadate, 20 mmβ-glycerophosphate, 0.2 mm EDTA, 0.5 mmdithiothreitol, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 20 μm leupeptin, 0.15 units/ml aprotinin at 4 °C. Cell lysates were transferred to a microcentrifuge tube, and Triton-insoluble material pelleted at 14,000 × g for 10 min. After taking an aliquot for protein determination (10Bradford M.M. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 72: 248-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (213377) Google Scholar) to permit equal protein loading of gel lanes, samples were heated in sample buffer and subjected to SDS-PAGE. Samples were transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride membranes (Immobilon-P, Millipore) and subjected to immunoblotting using standard methods. Bound secondary antibody was detected using luminol blotting reagents (Santa Cruz Biotech), and the signal captured on Biomax MR film (Kodak). Films were scanned using a laser densitometer (Molecular Dynamics) and bands quantified using ImageQuant software.ImmunoprecipitationCleared cell lysates prepared as above were rocked at 4 °C with the appropriate antibody for 1 h. Protein A/G-agarose was then added, and rocking continued for a further 2 h. The protein A/G-agarose beads were washed 4 times with ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline, and then incubated with sample buffer at 75 °C for 10 min to remove bound protein from the beads. The supernatant was subjected to SDS-PAGE and immunoblotting as described above.Proteolytic Localization of the Threonine Phosphorylation SiteFor chymotryptic digestion, cell lysate (2 mg/ml) was incubated with TLCK-treated chymotrypsin, 20 μg/ml at 25 °C. Aliquots were taken at time points, heated with sample buffer, and subjected to SDS-PAGE and immunoblotting. For hydroxylamine cleavage, cell lysate was diluted 1:10 with 2 m hydroxylamine hydrochloride, 6 m guanidine hydrochloride which had been adjusted to pH 9.0 with LiOH. The mixture was incubated at 45 °C for 3 h, dialyzed against 6 m urea, 40 mm Hepes, pH 7.5, and concentrated by centrifugation in a Microcon 10 centrifugal filter (Millipore). An aliquot of the concentrated digested lysate was then subjected to SDS-PAGE and immunoblotting.Fusion Protein Expression and MutationA 1906-base pair fragment (including 3′-untranslated residues), obtained from a clone of mouse NMHC-IIA provided by M. Conti, was subcloned into pGEX-5T2 to give a glutathione S-transferase fusion protein including the carboxyl-terminal 199 amino acids of NMHC-IIA. The threonine residue located 22 amino acids from the carboxyl terminus, corresponding to rat NMHC-IIA Thr-1940, was mutated to Ala using the Quikchange system (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA). The primers used were 5′-TGTTCGGAAAGGCGCCGGCGACTGCTCAG-3′ and the complementary antisense primer; the mutated residue, shown in bold, converts Thr to Ala and introduces an SfoI site for rapid clone selection. A 450-base pair fragment was subcloned from a clone encoding human NMHC-IIA (Dr. Qize Wei, NHLBI) into pGEX-4T1 to give a glutathioneS-transferase fusion protein encoding the carboxyl-terminal 150 amino acids of NMHC-IIA. Ala-1940 was mutated to Thr using the primers 5′-CCGGAAAGGCACCGGGATGGCTCC-3′ and the complementary antisense primer; the mutated residue, shown in bold, converts Ala to Thr and removes an SfoI site. SDS-PAGE-purified primers were obtained from Life Technologies, Inc. (Gaithersburg MD). Fusion proteins were expressed in Escherichia coli and purified by standard methods (11Smith D.B. Johnson K.S.

Enslen H. Myung P.S. Maurer R.A. Genes Dev. 1994; 8: 2527-2539Crossref PubMed Scopus (636) Google Scholar) were generously provided by Dr. Richard Maurer (Oregon Health Sciences University). An expression vector encoding human NMHC-IIA with GFP fused to the amino terminus was kindly provided by Q. Wei. Ala-1940 was mutated to Thr as described above for the human pGEX-4T1 construct. Transfection was performed using Effectene (Qiagen, Valencia, CA) following the manufacturer's standard protocol. pAdVantage (Promega, Madison, WI) was co-transfected with the expression vectors to improve expression levels by inhibiting dsRNA-activated inhibitor.In Vitro Phosphorylation with CaM Kinase II and CaM Kinase AssayProtein or peptide substrates were incubated with CaM kinase II, and where indicated [γ-32P]ATP, 250 μCi/mmol, in a reaction buffer consisting of 20 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 10 mm MgCl2, 2 mmCaCl2, 2.4 mm calmodulin, 0.5 mmdithiothreitol, 0.1 mm EDTA, 50 μm ATP. Phosphorylated proteins and peptides were then separated on NuPAGE 4–12% gels run in MES buffer. CaM kinase II activity in cell lysates was determined by phosphorylation of autocamtide-2 and capture of the phosphorylated peptide on Whatman P81 phosphocellulose as described previously (13Miralem T. Templeton D.M. Biochem. J. 1998; 330: 651-657Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar).Phosphoamino Acid DeterminationAfter in vitrolabeling of peptide, the reaction mixture was lyophilized and taken up in 6 m HCl, 50 μl. The mixture was incubated at 110 °C for 1 h, and lyophilized after addition of 400 μl of water. The mixture was dissolved in electrophoresis buffer (glacial acetic acid/pyridine/water, 10:1:189, pH 3.5) (14van der Geer P. Hunter T. Electrophoresis. 1994; 15: 544-554Crossref PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar), marker phosphoamino acids added, and an aliquot spotted on to a 20 × 20-cm glass-backed cellulose TLC plate. Electrophoresis was carried out for 30 min at 1.3 kV, the plate dried, and the phosphoamino acids visualized with ninhydrin. The plate was then subjected to autoradiography.Measurement of Secretion by Hexosaminidase AssayThe release of the secretory granule marker hexosaminidase was measured as described previously (15Choi O.H. Lee J.H. Kassessinoff T. Cunha-Melo J.R. Jones S.V. Beaven M.A. J. Immunol. 1993; 151: 5586-5595PubMed Google Scholar). Released hexosaminidase was expressed as a percentage of total hexosaminidase.Statistical AnalysisResults are presented as mean ± S.E. Comparisons between 2 groups were performed by paired or unpaired Student's t test as appropriate. Comparisons between more than 2 groups were made by repeated measure analysis of variance followed by post-hoc Tukey HSD test to assess significance of differences between individual groups.DISCUSSIONThe activation of secretory cells and release of mediators from secretory granules requires the granules to penetrate a cortical cytoskeletal barrier of actomyosin and other components in order to fuse with the plasma membrane and release their contents into the extracellular space (23Burgoyne R.D. Cheek T.R. Biosci. Rep. 1987; 7: 281-288Crossref PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar). Previous work has shown that stimulation of sensitized mast cells with antigen leads to the rapid PKC-dependent phosphorylation of nonmuscle myosin on serine residues in both the light and heavy chains (5Ludowyke R.I. Peleg I. Beaven M.A. Adelstein R.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 12492-12501Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The kinetics of early shape change and formation of myosin-deficient lamellopodia in RBL-2H3 cells correlate temporally, consistent with a role for myosin phosphorylation in the disruption of the cortical actomyosin rim that occurs during mast cell activation (24Spudich A. Cell Motil. Cytoskeleton. 1994; 29: 345-353Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). This disruption may in turn facilitate interaction between the secretory granule and the plasma membrane. Here we demonstrate for the first time that CaM kinase II is activated in RBL-2H3 cells by stimuli which increase cytoplasmic calcium. The activation of CaM kinase II results in the phosphorylation of NMHC-IIA at Thr-1940, close to the carboxyl terminus and distal to the coiled-coil region.The essential role of increases in intracellular calcium and PKC activity in mast cell activation have been recognized for many years (1Katakami Y. Kaibuchi K. Sawamura M. Takai Y. Nishizuka Y. Biochem. Cell Biol. 1984; 121: 573-578Google Scholar, 2Beaven M.A. Guthrie D.F. Moore J.P. Smith G.A. Hesketh T.R. Metcalfe J.C. J. Cell Biol. 1987; 105: 1129-1136Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar, 3Sagi-Eisenberg R. Lieman H. Pecht I. Nature. 1985; 313: 59-60Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar, 4Ozawa K. Szallasi Z. Kazanietz M.G. Blumberg P.M. Mischak H. Mushinski J.F. Beaven M.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 1749-1756Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). However, the potential role of the other main calcium-dependent kinase family, the CaM kinases, in mast cell activation has not been studied in depth. The CaM kinases are a family of three kinases, CaM kinases I, II, and IV. CaM kinases I and IV are monomeric, while CaM kinase II is a large multimer. CaM kinase I and IV, but not CaM kinase II, are regulated by an upstream kinase, CaM kinase kinase (25Soderling T.R. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1999; 24: 232-236Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (439) Google Scholar). CaM kinase II is activated in RBL-2H3 m1 cells stimulated with antigen or with carbachol, and activation of CaM kinase II is accompanied by the threonine phosphorylation of NMHC-IIA with a similar time course. The phosphorylation is calcium-dependent, requiring both an elevation of intracellular calcium, blocked by BAPTA, and influx of extracellular calcium, blocked by brief incubation with EGTA. Carbachol stimulation led to a larger increase in NMHC-IIA phosphothreonine than antigen, paralleling the larger increase in intracellular calcium (16Choi O.H. Kim J.H. Kinet J.P. Nature. 1996; 380: 634-636Crossref PubMed Scopus (383) Google Scholar) and the greater extent of secretion (8Jones S.V. Choi O.H. Beaven M.A. FEBS Lett. 1991; 289: 47-50Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar) found with carbachol relative to antigen. Phosphorylation appears to be mediated via a CaM kinase-dependent pathway rather than by PKC, since threonine phosphorylation of NMHC is inhibited by the CaM kinase inhibitor KN-93 but not by the PKC inhibitor GF109203X. In addition, treatment of the cells with PMA did not result in threonine phosphorylation of NMHC-IIA. KN-93 inhibits CaM kinase II with an IC50 of 0.37 μm (19Sumi M. Kiuchi K. Ishikawa T. Ishii A. Hagiwara M. Nagatsu T. Hidaka H. Biochem. Cell Biol. 1991; 181: 968-975Google Scholar), but also inhibits CaM kinase I and IV (IC50 2.7 and 50 μm,respectively) (26Patel R. Holt M. Philipova R. Moss S. Schulman H. Hidaka H. Whitaker M. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 7958-7968Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar). While the time course of activation of CaM kinase II and effects of constitutively active CaM kinase II are consistent with a role for this enzyme in NMHC-IIA threonine phosphorylation, involvement of CaM kinase IV cannot be excluded. Since KN-93 is less effective against CaM kinase IV, a contribution from CaM kinase IV could explain the incomplete inhibition of NMHC-IIA threonine phosphorylation by KN-93.There is increasing evidence that converging calcium/calmodulin-dependent pathways are important for secretion. Calmodulin-dependent activation of myosin light chain kinase and phosphorylation of myosin light chain is required for calcium-induced cortical F-actin disassembly (27Sullivan R. Price L.S. Koffer A. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 38140-38146Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). CaM kinase inhibitors also inhibit insulin secretion in pancreatic cells (28Easom R.A. Diabetes. 1999; 48: 675-684Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar) and gonadotropin-releasing hormone secretion from infundibular explants (29Waters W.W. Chen P.L. McArthur N.H. Moreno P.A. Harms P.G. Neuroendocrinology. 1998; 67: 145-152Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar), suggesting that there may be a more general role for CaM kinases in secretory processes. Threonine phosphorylation of NMHC-IIA is also found in pancreatic cells undergoing secretion (7Wilson J.R. Biden T.J. Ludowyke R.I. Diabetes. 1999; 48: 2383-2389Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar, 30An J. Zhao G. Churgay L.M. Osborne J.J. Hale J.E. Becker G.W. Gold G. Stramm L.E. Shi Y. Am. J. Physiol. 1999; 277: E862-8629PubMed Google Scholar). The effect of CaM kinase phosphorylation of Thr-1940 in NMHC-IIA on the interactions between actin and myosin (and possibly other cytoskeletal proteins) may give further insight into the secretory process. The ability of the CaM kinase inhibitor KN-93, but not the inactive analogue KN-92, to inhibit secretion in RBL-2H3 cells in response to carbachol lends further credence for a functional role for CaM kinase in mast cell secretion. The lack of effect of KN-93 on antigen-mediated secretion, and the absence of CaM kinase phosphorylation of NMHC-IIA in human cells, implies that NMHC-IIA threonine phosphorylation may have a facilitatory role rather than being essential for secretion. This may reflect redundancy in the IgE-mediated pathway, perhaps between PKC and CaM kinase-mediated NMHC-IIA phosphorylation. Alternatively, CaM kinase may be having additional upstream effects in the carbachol-mediated pathway which are responsible for the inhibition of carbachol-mediated secretion by KN-93.The non-helical carboxyl-terminal region of the myosin rod modulates the assembly of myosin filaments (31Cross R.A. Vandekerckhove J. FEBS Lett. 1986; 200: 355-360Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar, 32Ikebe M. Hewett T.E. Martin A.F. Chen M. Hartshorne D.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 7030-7036Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 33Hodge T.P. Cross R. Kendrick-Jones J. J. Cell Biol. 1992; 118: 1085-1095Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar), and it has been suggested that phosphorylation of the NMHC carboxyl terminus affects filament formation in an isoform-specific manner; phosphorylation by either PKC or casein kinase inhibits assembly of NMHC-IIB isoforms, but not of NMHC-IIA (21Murakami N. Chauhan V.P. Elzinga M. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 1989-2003Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). An alternative mechanism by which threonine phosphorylation of NMHC-IIA could affect filament assembly is through interactions with other proteins, and in particular with Mts 1. Mts 1 is a 9-kDa calcium-binding protein of the S100 family, which is up-regulated in cancer cells and highly motile cells (34Grigorian M. Tulchinsky E. Burrone O. Tarabykina S. Georgiev G. Lukanidin E. Electrophoresis. 1994; 15: 463-468Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). Mts 1 binds to the non-helical region of NMHC and destabilizes filaments (35Ford H.L. Silver D.L. Kachar B. Sellers J.R. Zain S.B. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 16321-16327Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). Binding occurs at residues 1909–1937 of human platelet NMHC-IIA, and inhibits phosphorylation of Ser-1917 by PKC (36Kriajevska M. Tarabykina S. Bronstein I. Maitland N. Lomonosov M. Hansen K. Georgiev G. Lukanidin E. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 9852-9856Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar). It will therefore be of interest to determine whether phosphorylation of NMHC-IIA at Thr-1940 has any effect on filament assembly or Mts 1 binding. Preliminary experiments have shown that Mts 1 also inhibits phosphorylation of NMHC-IIA by CaM kinase II in vitro. 3D. B. Buxton and R. S. Adelstein, unpublished results.Calcium-dependent threonine phosphorylation of NMHC-IIA has now been shown in a range of rodent cells, including PC12 rat pheochromacytoma cells and mouse NIE-115 neuroblastoma cells (6van Leeuwen F.N. van Delft S. Kain H.E. van der Kammen R.A. Collard J.G. Nat Cell Biol. 1999; 1: 242-248Crossref PubMed Scopus (183) Google Scholar), rat islets and rat RINm5F insulinoma cells (7Wilson J.R. Biden T.J. Ludowyke R.I. Diabetes. 1999; 48: 2383-2389Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar), in the mouse pancreatic cell line βTC6-F7 (30An J. Zhao G. Churgay L.M. Osborne J.J. Hale J.E. Becker G.W. Gold G. Stramm L.E. Shi Y. Am. J. Physiol. 1999; 277: E862-8629PubMed Google Scholar), and in mouse fibroblasts and rat RBL-2H3 mast cells. However, increasing intracellular calcium with ionomycin did not result in threonine phosphorylation of NMHC-IIA in HeLa cells or the Y79 retinoblastoma cell line, both of which are derived from humans. While the absence of some component of the signal transduction cascade leading to myosin phosphorylation cannot be excluded, a more likely explanation is a sequence difference between rodent and human NMHC-IIA, resulting in the absence of the phosphorylated threonine or targeting residues in human cells. The carboxyl terminus of mouse NMHC-IIA was phosphorylated in vitro by CaM kinase, while human NMHC-IIA carboxyl-terminal was not. Inspection of the sequences for rat and mouse NMHC-IIA distal to the coiled-coil region showed 2 conserved threonines which are absent in human NMHC-IIA; in particular, comparison of the conserved rat (17Choi O.H. Park C.S. Itoh K. Adelstein R.S. Beaven M.A. J. Muscle Res. Cell Motil. 1996; 17: 69-77Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar) and mouse2 sequence surrounding Thr-1940 (Ile-Val-Arg-Lys-Gly-Thr-Gly) with the optimal CaM kinase consensus sequences for CaM kinase IV (Hyd-X-Arg-X-X-Ser/Thr) and CaM kinase IIa (Hyd-X-Arg-X-NB-Ser/Thr-Hyd) (37White R.R. Kwon Y.G. Taing M. Lawrence D.S. Edelman A.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 3166-3172Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar) show a good correspondence, while the sequence is less well conserved in human NMHC-IIA (Met-Ala-Arg-Lys-Gly-Ala-Gly) (22Saez C.G. Myers J.C. Shows T.B. Leinwand L.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 1164-1168Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar).This high degree of sequence conservation in rat and mouse made it a good candidate as the kinase target, which was confirmed with mutants of the NMHC-IIA fusion proteins. Mutation of Thr-1940 to Ala in mouse NMHC-IIA abrogated in vitro phosphorylation, while mutation of Ala-1940 to Thr in human NMHC-IIA restored phosphorylation by CaM kinase II. A peptide corresponding to rat NMHC-IIA residues 1933–1951 was phosphorylated in vitro by CaM kinase II on Thr-1940, indicating that the effects of mutation of residue 1940 on fusion protein phosphorylation were not due to indirect conformational changes. Co-expression experiments in HeLa cells showed that constitutively active CaM kinase II also phosphorylated mutant full-length NMHC-IIA containing Thr-1940, but not wild type NMHC-IIA. Taken together these data confirm that Thr-1940 of rodent NMHC-IIA is phosphorylated by CaM kinase II, and that the absence of this site in human NMHC-IIA explains the lack of threonine phosphorylation in stimulated human cells.The absence of threonine phosphorylation in human cells is interesting, and may imply that they are able to rearrange their actomyosin cytoskeleton with only PKC-dependent serine phosphorylation of NMHC-II, in addition to serine phosphorylation of the nonmuscle myosin light chain. Conversely, human cells could have developed an alternative phosphoacceptor pathway, as has been demonstrated for the transcription factor C/EBPβ. The highly conserved threonine phosphoacceptor (Thr-217) in the transcription factor C/EBPβ required for transforming growth factor α-mediated hepatocyte proliferation in mouse, is replaced by alanine in rat, while mouse/human Ala-105 has been replaced by Ser-105 in rat (38Buck M. Poli V. van der Geer P. Chojkier M. Hunter T. Mol. Cell. 1999; 4: 1087-1092Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar). The two phosphoacceptors have analogous functions, since mutation of mouse Thr-217 or rat Ser-105 with Ala blocks proliferation while replacement with Asp promotes proliferation in both cases. It will be of interest to determine by peptide mapping whether any additional phosphoacceptors have evolved in human NMHC-IIA to substitute for the phosphothreonine.The activation of CaM kinase II that we have demonstrated also raises the possibility that CaM kinase could contribute to the changes in gene expression found following mast cell activation (39Gordon J.R. Burd P.R. Galli S"

Like its homologs, CCT (chaperonin containing TCP-1) in eukaryotes and the thermosome in archaea, GroEL forms a multi-subunit assembly arranged into twin rings stacked end-to-end (3Hemmingsen S.M.

The resultant homotetradecamer of 57-kDa subunits provides a deep cavity where non-native protein species may bind and undergo productive folding (6Braig K. Furuya F. Hainfeld J. Horwich A.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 3978-3982Crossref PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar). GroEL is assisted in its chaperoning function by GroES, a heptamer composed of identical 10-kDa subunits arranged into a single ring (7Chandrasekhar G.N. Tilly K. Woolford C. Hendrix R. Georgopoulos C. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 12414-12419Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 8Martin J. Langer T. Boteva R. Schramel A. Horwich A.L. Hartl F.U. Nature. 1991; 352: 36-42Crossref PubMed Scopus (718) Google Scholar). One of the functions of GroES is to act as a lid on the GroEL cylinder, thereby providing an enclosed environment for the folding polypeptide. However, its binding to GroEL plays other important roles too, such as modulating the low intrinsic ATPase activity of GroEL by coordinating the actions of nucleotide binding and hydrolysis (7Chandrasekhar G.N.

Crystallographic data have enabled the visualization of the GroEL complex and individual subunit architecture (10Braig K. Otwinowski Z. Hegde R. Boisvert D.C. Joachimiak A. Horwich A.L. Sigler P.B. Nature. 1994; 371: 578-586Crossref PubMed Scopus (1182) Google Scholar, 11Boisvert D.C. Wang J.M. Otwinowski Z. Horwich A.L. Sigler P.B. Nature Struct.

It has revealed the regions implicated in both nucleotide and substrate binding. It is now known that each subunit of GroEL is arranged into three domains. An equatorial domain forms the majority of intersubunit interactions and is the site of nucleotide binding. The apical domain contains the substrate binding and GroES binding residues (13Fenton W.A. Kashi Y. Furtak K. Horwich A.L. Nature. 1994; 371: 614-619Crossref PubMed Scopus (569) Google Scholar). The two domains are connected by a hinge region, which transmits information on the status of GroES, polypeptide, and nucleotide binding (14Martin J. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 7351-7357Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar). Because GroEL/GroES has been the most widely studied chaperonin system, its mechanism of protein folding is known in some detail. Briefly, GroEL binds substrate protein in one of its two ring cavities. The bound substrate protein is in a molten-globule state characterized by the presence of secondary structure but lacking well defined tertiary structure (8Martin J. Langer T. Boteva R. Schramel A. Horwich A.L. Hartl F.U. Nature. 1991; 352: 36-42Crossref PubMed Scopus (718) Google Scholar, 15Robinson C.V. Gross M. Eyles S.J. Ewbank J.J. Mayhew M. Hartl F.U. Dobson C.M. Radford S.E. Nature. 1994; 372: 646-651Crossref PubMed Scopus (194) Google Scholar). Cooperative binding of seven molecules of ATP to the same (cis) ring as the bound polypeptide is immediately followed by the binding of GroES, also to the cis ring, which causes the polypeptide to be displaced into the cavity (4Langer T. Pfeifer G. Martin J. Baumeister W. Hartl F.U. EMBO J. 1992; 11: 4757-4765Crossref PubMed Scopus (352) Google Scholar, 17Martin J. Mayhew M. Langer T. Hartl F.U. Nature. 1993; 366: 228-233Crossref PubMed Scopus (235) Google Scholar). The released polypeptide now folds in the protective environment of the enclosed chaperonin complex. Hydrolysis of the seven ATP molecules primes the cis complex for disassembly, and the binding of seven ATP molecules to the opposite (trans) ring of GroEL causes the release of both GroES and the folded substrate (18Rye H.S.

The system is now reset and ready to either accept a new substrate or rebind the just-released but not yet native polypeptide for another round of folding.Folding by GroEL involves a complex interplay of three ligands (i.e. substrate, GroES, and nucleotide), and all three are capable of inducing allosteric conformational changes within GroEL, either individually or in concert (19Yifrach O.

These can provide a wealth of information on the inner workings of the system as a whole. Here we report on the functional properties of one such altered state, induced by the presence of high concentrations of ammonium sulfate.Our work was prompted by structural data on both GroEL and the thermosome from the archaeon Thermoplasma acidophilum, which have been obtained from the analysis of crystals grown in high concentrations of ammonium sulfate (10Braig K. Otwinowski Z. Hegde R. Boisvert D.C. Joachimiak A. Horwich A.L. Sigler P.B. Nature. 1994; 371: 578-586Crossref PubMed Scopus (1182) Google Scholar, 31Ditzel L. Löwe J. Stock D. Stetter K.-O. Huber H. Huber R. Steinbacher S. Cell. 1998; 93: 125-138Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (367) Google Scholar). Furthermore, the in vitro assembly of functional chaperonins from certain species of archaea has required the presence of ammonium sulfate (32Furutani M. Iida T. Yoshida T. Maruyama T. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 28399-28407Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar), and the ATPase activity of at least one archaeal chaperonin has been shown to be dependent on a relatively high concentration of ammonium ions (33Andrä S. Frey G. Jaenicke R. Stetter K.O. Eur. J. Biochem. 1998; 255: 93-99Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). We find that high ammonium sulfate concentrations alter the functional properties of GroEL, resulting in, among other things, an increased hydrophobic surface area and increased stringency for protein folding. Most surprisingly, these conditions allow the extension of E. coli chaperonin action to thermophilic conditions.DISCUSSIONIn this study, we have characterized the functional properties of the GroEL chaperonin system in the presence of high salt concentrations. The most surprising result is the ability of GroEL to function as a chaperone under thermophilic conditions in 1.2m (NH4)2SO4. GroEL is able to suppress thermally induced aggregation of citrate synthase. It can bind to intermediates of heat-inactivated α-glucosidase and mediate their refolding in a GroES-dependent manner, and, as at room temperature, it can bind and refold acid-denatured GFP with the same increased substrate stringency. We find that high concentrations of ammonium ions have a stimulatory effect on the ATPase activity of GroEL. At 30 °C, NH4Cl and (NH4)2SO4 are equally effective, even though the former contributes only half the number of ammonium ions on a per mole basis. A higher concentration of ammonium ions may counteract negative effects of sulfate. In fact, Na2SO4 has an inhibitory effect on the ATPase activity of GroEL. At high concentrations, some salts are thought to make a protein more rigid (51Timasheff S.N. Arakawa T. Chapter 14: Stabilization of Protein Structure by Solvents.“Protein Structure: A Practical Approach”. Oxford University Press Inc., New York1997Google Scholar) and are widely used as protein stabilizers. This is particularly true of SO42−, which has a high charge density and resides high on the Hofmeister series of anions. Sulfate ions, by virtue of making the protein more rigid, may hinder the ability of the chaperonin to hydrolyze ATP. Nevertheless, the stabilizing effect of the sulfate ions enables GroEL to function at thermophilic conditions by preventing its denaturation and keeping it soluble. This is evident in the fact that at temperatures of up to 75 °C, only ammonium sulfate is able to support a markedly enhanced chaperonin activity.Several features of the GroEL/GroES chaperonin system can be explained in terms of a Monod-Wyman-Changeux representation (52Monod J. Wyman J. Changeux J.P. J. Mol. Biol. 1965; 12: 88-118Crossref PubMed Scopus (6084) Google Scholar). Each of the two rings can either be in a tense acceptor state (T), in which GroEL has high affinity for substrate protein, low affinity for ATP, and high ATP hydrolysis rates, or in a relaxed state (R) with high affinity for ATP and low affinity for protein substrate. With increasing ATP concentrations, the equilibrium of conformations shifts first to the TR state, and when most GroEL subunits are occupied by ATP, the RR state dominates in which ATP hydrolysis rates are slightly decreased and substrate protein is released (19Yifrach O. Horovitz A. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 5303-5308Crossref PubMed Scopus (263) Google Scholar, 20Yifrach O. Horovitz A. J. Mol.

Biol. 1999; 293: 667-684Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). Our data are consistent with the possibility that (NH4)2SO4, rather than acting as an uncoupler, induces a conformational change in GroEL to a TT-like state in which the ATPase activity is at or near capacity. Unlike in low concentrations of KCl, where the substrate protein αs1-casein stimulates the ATPase activity of GroEL, no such increase is observed in (NH4)2SO4. Indeed, with GroEL already in a TT-like state, substrate protein should have no further effect. It has been established that GroES binding to GroEL regulates the ATPase activity of the chaperonin (4Langer T. Pfeifer G. Martin J. Baumeister W. Hartl F.U. EMBO J. 1992; 11: 4757-4765Crossref PubMed Scopus (352) Google Scholar, 7Chandrasekhar G.N. Tilly K. Woolford C. Hendrix R. Georgopoulos C. J. Biol.

Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 2554-2563Crossref PubMed Scopus (236) Google Scholar). When GroES binds to GroEL, it is able to shift the chaperonin conformation to TR and RR states of submaximal ATP hydrolysis. Consequently, in the presence of GroES, substrate should show more pronounced effects in ammonium sulfate by trying to shift the T/R equilibrium back toward the TT state. This is exactly what we have observed with αs1-casein, which stimulates ATP hydrolysis in 1.2m (NH4)2SO4 in the presence of GroES.GroEL is fully able to fold proteins under these conditions at both ambient and thermophilic temperatures. Interestingly, the presence of the high concentration of ammonium sulfate increases substrate stringency such that GFP, capable of folding in a GroES-independent manner under low salt conditions, now becomes strictly GroES-dependent. A strongly favored TT-like state in 1.2m (NH4)2SO4 would explain this inability of ATP hydrolysis alone to mediate GFP release from GroEL. In the absence of GroES, the nucleotide is not able to induce on its own the conformational shifts toward the TR and RR state that are necessary to dissociate the substrate. The predominantly present TT-like GroEL form can thus be seen as locked in a conformation with high substrate affinity. Moreover, in this conformation GroEL exposes more hydrophobic binding surface than in low salt, which may affect the interaction with substrate protein. GroEL-bound substrates are typically in a molten globule-like state (8Martin J. Langer T. Boteva R. Schramel A. Horwich A.L. Hartl F.U. Nature. 1991; 352: 36-42Crossref PubMed Scopus (718) Google Scholar, 15Robinson C.V. Gross M. Eyles S.J. Ewbank J.J. Mayhew M. Hartl F.U. Dobson C.M. Radford S.E. Nature. 1994; 372: 646-651Crossref PubMed Scopus (194) Google Scholar). This quasi-ordered condition, in which secondary structure is present but tertiary structure is undefined, is characterized by the exposure of hydrophobic residues that would normally be buried in a native protein. GroEL contains a number of hydrophobic residues in its apical domain that have been demonstrated to be necessary for binding of non-native substrate protein (13Fenton W.A. Kashi Y. Furtak K. Horwich A.L. Nature. 1994; 371: 614-619Crossref PubMed Scopus (569) Google Scholar). It has been demonstrated that perturbation of the ionic strength of the solvent can increase exposure of hydrophobic residues on GroEL (28Horowitz P.M. Hua S. Gibbons D.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 1535-1542Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar, 30Brazil B.T. Ybarra J. Horowitz P.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 3257-3263Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). Ammonium sulfate seems to elicit a similar change in the chaperonin. Titration data presented here suggest that GroEL can bind more bisANS per tetradecamer in 1.2 m(NH4)2SO4 than in low salt. Moreover, the hydrophobic nature of the binding sites is comparable, because the emission λmax is the same in both salts. There may well be additional reasons for the inability of ATP alone to mediate GFP release in (NH4)2SO4. For example, increased GFP stringency could be the result of some change within GFP itself induced by the high salt. The fluorescence of native GFP is virtually the same in both 50 mm KCl and 1.2m (NH4)2SO4, and the spontaneous recovery of fluorescence of acid-denatured GFP is essentially complete in both buffers. This suggests that GFP behaves similarly in both buffers. Nevertheless, it is conceivable that non-native GFP intermediate(s) bound by GroEL upon dilution from denaturant are different in nature such that those in 50 mmKCl are more amenable to release from GroEL by ATP alone than those in 1.2 m (NH4)2SO4.The presence of high concentrations of ammonium ions and ammonium sulfate pertaining to chaperonin structure and function has surfaced a few times in recent literature (10Braig K. Otwinowski Z. Hegde R. Boisvert D.C. Joachimiak A. Horwich A.L. Sigler P.B. Nature. 1994; 371: 578-586Crossref PubMed Scopus (1182) Google Scholar, 31Ditzel L. Löwe J. Stock D. Stetter K.-O.

Biochem. 1998; 255: 93-99Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). Notably, high ammonium sulfate concentrations were used to obtain crystals for the determination of the structures of both E. coli GroEL and the thermosome from T. acidophilum. Although the structures represent well the overall architecture of the chaperonins, questions have arisen as to the nature of the actual state, in terms of functional properties, that these structures represent. For instance, the unliganded thermosome from T. acidophilum was crystallized in 2 m(NH4)2SO4 in a “closed” conformation said to represent the Mg-ATP bound form (31Ditzel L. Löwe J. Stock D. Stetter K.-O. Huber H. Huber R. Steinbacher S. Cell. 1998; 93: 125-138Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (367) Google Scholar). However, Gutsche et al. (55Gutsche I. Holzinger J. Rössle M. Heumann H. Baumeister W. May R.P. Curr. Biol. 2000; 10: 405-408Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar) have recently demonstrated by small angle neutron scattering that in solution, the Mg-ATP bound thermosome favors the “open” conformation in low salt buffer. The closed conformation occurs only after ATP hydrolysis, but before release of Pi. Surprisingly, Gutsche et al. (55Gutsche I. Holzinger J. Rössle M. Heumann H. Baumeister W. May R.P. Curr. Biol. 2000; 10: 405-408Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar) also showed that the crystallization buffer can induce the closed conformation in solution. The crystals for the unliganded structure of GroEL were grown in similarly high (NH4)2SO4 concentrations as those employed in this study (10Braig K. Otwinowski Z. Hegde R. Boisvert D.C. Joachimiak A. Horwich A.L. Sigler P.B. Nature. 1994; 371: 578-586Crossref PubMed Scopus (1182) Google Scholar). Based on our results it is conceivable that the GroEL represented in that crystal structure has solution properties similar to the functional state observed here. Although these salt conditions are not physiologically relevant for E. coli in vivo, the changes in chaperonin function that they induce are nevertheless informative. For example, it was noted that high concentrations of sodium sulfate resulted in a stimulation of the ATPase activity of the archaeal chaperonin because of the aforementioned induction of the “closed” conformation, which occurs after ATP hydrolysis (55Gutsche I. Holzinger J. Rössle M. Heumann H. Baumeister W. May R.P. Curr. Biol. 2000; 10: 405-408Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). The situation is different with bacterial chaperonins, because our findings show that sulfate inhibits the ATPase of GroEL; an effect that is in turn counterbalanced by high concentrations of ammonium ions. This difference serves to underscore the likelihood that despite having structurally conserved ATP-binding domains, the molecular basis of ATP hydrolysis in the two chaperonin systems may differ in some respects.It appears that examination of the solution properties of chaperonins, under the solvent conditions used for crystallization, is a worthwhile endeavor to better assign the functional state that the respective structures represent. Moreover, the ability to convert a mesophilic chaperonin into a thermophilic chaperonin opens interesting possibilities for direct comparison with and study of homologs from naturally occurring thermophiles. Some methanogenic archaea use increased intracellular ion concentrations to stabilize their proteins in vivo (16Hensel R. König H. FEMS Microbiol. Lett. 1988; 49: 75-79Crossref Scopus (162) Google Scholar). Whether or not a similar method of thermoadaptation is used by some extremophilic bacteria remains to be seen, but the results presented here suggest that this is a distinct possibility. The chaperonin GroEL from Escherichia coli belongs to a class of proteins, termed molecular chaperones, whose collective function is to assist in the folding of newly synthesized proteins and in the refolding of non-native polypeptides generated under conditions of stress (reviewed in Refs. 1Martin J. Hartl F.U. Curr. Opin. Struct. Biol. 1997; 7: 41-52Crossref PubMed Scopus (163) Google Scholar and 2Fenton W.A. Horwich A.L. Prot. Sci. 1997; 6: 743-760Crossref PubMed Scopus (325) Google Scholar). Like its homologs, CCT (chaperonin containing TCP-1) in eukaryotes and the thermosome in archaea, GroEL forms a multi-subunit assembly arranged into twin rings stacked end-to-end (3Hemmingsen S.M. Woolford C. van der Vies S.M. Tilly K. Dennis D.T. Georgopoulos C.P. Hendrix R., W. Ellis R.J. Nature. 1988; 333: 330-334Crossref PubMed Scopus (919) Google Scholar, 4Langer T. Pfeifer G. Martin J.

Biol. 1999; 293: 295-312Crossref PubMed Scopus (182) Google Scholar). The resultant homotetradecamer of 57-kDa subunits provides a deep cavity where non-native protein species may bind and undergo productive folding (6Braig K. Furuya F. Hainfeld J. Horwich A.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 3978-3982Crossref PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar). GroEL is assisted in its chaperoning function by GroES, a heptamer composed of identical 10-kDa subunits arranged into a single ring (7Chandrasekhar G.N. Tilly K. Woolford C. Hendrix R. Georgopoulos C. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 12414-12419Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 8Martin J. Langer T. Boteva R. Schramel A. Horwich A.L. Hartl F.U. Nature. 1991; 352: 36-42Crossref PubMed Scopus (718) Google Scholar). One of the functions of GroES is to act as a lid on the GroEL cylinder, thereby providing an enclosed environment for the folding polypeptide. However, its binding to GroEL plays other important roles too, such as modulating the low intrinsic ATPase activity of GroEL by coordinating the actions of nucleotide binding and hydrolysis (7Chandrasekhar G.N. Tilly K. Woolford C. Hendrix R. Georgopoulos C. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 12414-12419Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 8Martin J. Langer T. Boteva R. Schramel A. Horwich A.L. Hartl F.U.

Crystallographic data have enabled the visualization of the GroEL complex and individual subunit architecture (10Braig K. Otwinowski Z. Hegde R. Boisvert D.C. Joachimiak A. Horwich A.L. Sigler P.B. Nature. 1994; 371: 578-586Crossref PubMed Scopus (1182) Google Scholar, 11Boisvert D.C. Wang J.M. Otwinowski Z. Horwich A.L. Sigler P.B. Nature Struct.

It has revealed the regions implicated in both nucleotide and substrate binding. It is now known that each subunit of GroEL is arranged into three domains. An equatorial domain forms the majority of intersubunit interactions and is the site of nucleotide binding. The apical domain contains the substrate binding and GroES binding residues (13Fenton W.A. Kashi Y. Furtak K. Horwich A.L. Nature. 1994; 371: 614-619Crossref PubMed Scopus (569) Google Scholar). The two domains are connected by a hinge region, which transmits information on the status of GroES, polypeptide, and nucleotide binding (14Martin J. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 7351-7357Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar). Because GroEL/GroES has been the most widely studied chaperonin system, its mechanism of protein folding is known in some detail. Briefly, GroEL binds substrate protein in one of its two ring cavities. The bound substrate protein is in a molten-globule state characterized by the presence of secondary structure but lacking well defined tertiary structure (8Martin J. Langer T. Boteva R. Schramel A. Horwich A.L. Hartl F.U. Nature. 1991; 352: 36-42Crossref PubMed Scopus (718) Google Scholar, 15Robinson C.V. Gross M. Eyles S.J. Ewbank J.J. Mayhew M. Hartl F.U. Dobson C.M. Radford S.E. Nature. 1994; 372: 646-651Crossref PubMed Scopus (194) Google Scholar). Cooperative binding of seven molecules of ATP to the same (cis) ring as the bound polypeptide is immediately followed by the binding of GroES, also to the cis ring, which causes the polypeptide to be displaced into the cavity (4Langer T. Pfeifer G. Martin J. Baumeister W. Hartl F.U. EMBO J. 1992; 11: 4757-4765Crossref PubMed Scopus (352) Google Scholar, 17Martin J. Mayhew M. Langer T. Hartl F.U. Nature. 1993; 366: 228-233Crossref PubMed Scopus (235) Google Scholar). The released polypeptide now folds in the protective environment of the enclosed chaperonin complex. Hydrolysis of the seven ATP molecules primes the cis complex for disassembly, and the binding of seven ATP molecules to the opposite (trans) ring of GroEL causes the release of both GroES and the folded substrate (18Rye H.S. Burston S.G. Fenton W.A. Beechem J.M. Xu Z. Sigler P.B. Horwich A.L. Nature. 1997; 388: 792-798Crossref PubMed Scopus (351) Google Scholar). The system is now reset and ready to either accept a new substrate or rebind the just-released but not yet native polypeptide for another round of folding. Folding by GroEL involves a complex interplay of three ligands (i.e. substrate, GroES, and nucleotide), and all three are capable of inducing allosteric conformational changes within GroEL, either individually or in concert (19Yifrach O. Horovitz"

Factor XIIIA is secreted as a monomer into the extracellular matrix of the theca externa and is not associated with factor XIIIB as is the case in plasma. Our data suggest that, due to its transglutaminase activity, factor XIIIA stabilizes the follicular wall by cross-linking matrix components.

In the case of the domesticated chicken (Gallus gallus domesticus), fully developed oocytes are laid as eggs every 25 h. The oocytes develop in follicles, highly specialized structures of the ovary consisting of the oocyte proper in the center of the follicle, surrounded by concentric layers of cells, acellular material, and structures, including the perivitelline membrane (the equivalent of the zona pellucida in mammals), granulosa cells, a basement membrane, and the thecae interna and externa (1Perry M.M. Gilbert A.B. Evans A.J. J. Anat. 1978; 125: 481-497PubMed Google Scholar). Development of follicles can be divided into three major phases (for review see Ref. 2Johnson A.L. Crit. Rev. Poult. Biol. 1990; 2: 319-346Google Scholar). Phase 1 is characterized by a very slow growth of follicles lasting for several months. At the end of this period, numerous follicles have reached a diameter of 2–3 mm; the oocytes within these follicles do not contain significant amounts ofbona fide yolk (these follicles are referred to herein as small white follicles). During phase 2, some of these follicles develop further and reach a diameter of approximately 6 mm after 60 days. Due to yolk deposition into the oocyte, these follicles acquire a yellow appearance (here termed small yellow follicles). Finally, single follicles are selected from the pool of small yellow follicles every 25 h (synchronous with the ovulation cycle) and enter the rapid growth phase, which leads to mature follicles with a diameter of approximately 35 mm within 7 days. The fully developed oocyte is expelled from the follicle by ovulation and enters the oviduct, where egg formation starts. After ovulation, the remaining structure of the follicle, termed postovulatory follicle (POF),1 consists of the granulosa cells, basement membrane, and theca layers. The POF collapses, but stays metabolically active for up to 6 days before involution and resorption (2Johnson A.L. Crit. Rev. Poult. Biol. 1990; 2: 319-346Google Scholar). This developmental scheme establishes a hierarchy of follicles present at any given time in the ovary of a mature hen. Typically, the ovary contains five to eight prominent preovulatory follicles in the rapid 7-day growth phase. These follicles are numbered, from F1, the largest one, which will ovulate next, to the smallest distinguishable ones, usually F5 through F8. Despite our detailed knowledge about vitellogenesis (for review see Refs. 3Nimpf J. Schneider W.J. Atherosclerosis. 1998; 141: 191-202Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar and 4Schneider W.J. Osanger A. Waclawek M. Nimpf J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 379: 965-971PubMed Google Scholar) and steroid production in the follicle (for review see Ref. 2Johnson A.L. Crit. Rev. Poult. Biol. 1990; 2: 319-346Google Scholar), very little is known about the orchestration of these events at the molecular level. Especially, mechanisms responsible for establishing the follicular hierarchy are completely unknown. Additionally, another interesting point is the cellular and acellular architecture of the follicular wall. Although there is considerable knowledge about the morphology of this structure, very little is known about molecular and genetic aspects of cell differentiation and production of extracellular components during development of the follicle and its remodeling in preparation for and following ovulation. We are approaching these questions from two angles. First, we have recently begun to study and characterize the production of the acellular structures within the follicles, perivitelline membrane, and the basement membrane. We found, e.g. that one of the zona pellucida proteins, ZPC, is synthesized by granulosa cells and deposited in polarized fashion into the space between granulosa cells and the oocyte (5Waclawek M. Foisner R. Nimpf J. Schneider W.J. Biol. Reprod. 1998; 59: 1230-1239Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). ZP1, another constituent of the perivitelline membrane, however, is synthesized in the liver, transported via the bloodstream to the ovary, and becomes deposited in the perivitelline membrane (6Bausek N. Waclawek M. Schneider W.J. Wohlrab F. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 28866-28872Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar). Because follicle development takes place simultaneously, but non-synchronously in many different follicles, we have to assume that the program guiding these complex mechanisms is not controlled by systemic factors, but rather within the follicle itself. We expect a highly orchestrated interplay of differentially expressed genes within different cells, dependent on growth phases of the follicle. Thus, as part of our second approach we have started to screen for such genes using the differential mRNA display methodology. Here we report results obtained in such a screen for genes expressed at various levels during different phases of follicle development. We show that the avian homologue of human coagulation factor XIIIA is expressed and secreted by theca cells and propose that it stabilizes the follicular wall by cross-linking matrix components during the last growth spurt of the oocyte, in preparation for ovulation of the follicle, for its subsequent transition into the postovulatory follicle and resorption.

The reaction mixture (20 μl) for differential display (DD)-PCR contained 1 μl of diluted cDNA (1:15), 1 μm arbitrary primer (5′-TACAACGAGG-3′), 1 μm anchored primer (5′-T11AC-3′), 2.5 μm of each dNTP, 5 μCi of [α-35S]dATP, 20 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.4), 50 mm KCl, 1.25 mm MgCl2, 2.5 units of Taqpolymerase (Life Technologies, Inc.). After an incubation of 4 min at 94 °C, the mixture was subjected to 40 low stringency cycles (94 °C for 30 s, 40 °C for 2 min, 72 °C for 30 s) and a final extension at 72 °C for 30 s. 5 μl of the amplified cDNA fragments was separated on a 8% polyacrylamide 8m urea gel. Bands were visualized by exposing the dried gel to x-ray film (Kodak X-Omat). Gel pieces containing the bands of interest were excised from the gel and rehydrated in 150 μl of water by boiling for 30 min. Then the DNA was precipitated with ethanol and after dissolving in water used for reamplification as described for the original DD-PCR, except for the use of [α-35S]dATP. Reamplified DNA fragments were cloned into pCR2.1 (Invitrogen) and sequenced by the dideoxy chain termination method using the Sequenase Version 2.0 DNA sequencing kit (United States Biochemical). Sequence data obtained were subjected to homology search at nucleotide levels using the BLAST search of the National Institutes of Health. DD-PCR clone 12 was used as a probe for screening a chicken follicle cDNA library (7Bujo H. Hermann M. Kaderli M.O. Jacobsen L. Sugawara S. Nimpf J. Yamamoto T. Schneider W.J. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 5165-5175Crossref PubMed Scopus (217) Google Scholar) using standard conditions. Positive clones were subcloned into pBluescript II SK (Stratagene) and sequenced. To obtain the 5′-end of the coding sequence, 5′-rapid amplification of cDNA ends (RACE) was employed using the Marathon cDNA amplification kit (CLONTECH). The primers used were 5′-TCCTTCTCGTCATCCAGGTACACAGC-3′ and 5′-TCAGCACATCACCTATGAGGATCGG-3′. The full-length cDNA of chicken FXIIIA was cloned into the XbaI and SmaI sites of pCIneo (Promega) and expressed in the human embryonic kidney cell line 293. Transfection of the cells was performed using Lipofectin reagent (Life Technologies, Inc.). Stable transformants were selected by the addition of 500 mg/liter G418 to the medium (Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (Life Technologies, Inc.), 10% fetal calf serum, 584 mg/liter glutamine). Cells expressing factor XIIIA were washed three times with 2 ml each of phosphate-buffered saline (PBS), scraped from the dishes with a rubber policeman, and centrifuged at 2000 × g for 5 min, and the cell pellet was solubilized by addition of 150 μl of buffer/dish (200 mmTris maleate, pH 6.5, 2 mm CaCl2, 0.5 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 2.5 μmleupeptin, and 1.4% Triton X-100). The cell extracts were centrifuged at 300,000 × g for 40 min at 4 °C and the pellet discarded. cDNA fragments encoding amino acid residues 1–45 (corresponding to the activation peptide) and amino acid residues 674–735 (corresponding to the carboxyl terminus) of chicken factor XIIIA were cloned into pGEX-5X-1 (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). Isolation of the glutathione S-transferase fusion proteins in DH5α cells (8Herz J. Goldstein J.L. Strickland D.K. Ho Y.K. Brown M.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 21232-21238Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and production of the respective polyclonal antibodies (9Nimpf J. George R. Schneider W.J. J. Lipid Res. 1988; 29: 657-667Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) were carried out as described in the indicated references. The antisera were designated Ac16 (against the activation peptide) and A3 (against the carboxyl terminus). For immunoprecipitation, 1 ml of conditioned medium (from 293 cells expressing FXIIIA and mock-transfected cells) was incubated for 24 h at 4 °C with 5 μl of antiserum (Ac16) or preimmune serum and with 4 μg of Protein A-Sepharose (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) in 10 mm Tris/HCl, 150 mm NaCl, 2 mmEDTA, pH 7.4. Then the Sepharose beads were washed five times with ice-cold PBS. Proteins were eluted from the beads with Laemmli sample buffer containing β-mercaptoethanol (5%, v/v) and separated by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. Presence of chicken factor XIIIA in the immunoprecipitates was tested by Western blotting as described (10Vieira P.M. Vieira A.V. Sanders E.J. Steyrer E. Nimpf J. Schneider W.J. J. Lipid Res. 1995; 36: 601-610Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Follicles (6 mm) from an adult hen were dissected in ice-cold PBS, embedded in freezing agent (Microm, Austria) and immediately frozen. Cryostat sections of 12-μm thickness were prepared, transferred to Superfrost-Plus slides (Menzel) and stored at −70 °C. Slides were washed in PBS, incubated for 24 h with the respective primary antibody (Ac16; anti-α-collagen I, Sigma; anti-chicken-fibronectin, Chemicon Int.; anti-human-factor XIIIA, Calbiochem), washed, and incubated with a fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated anti-rabbit IgG (Sigma). After a final wash, microscopy was performed on a Zeiss microscope (Axiovert 135). Transglutaminase activity was detected as described previously (11Raghunath M. Hopfner B. Aeschlimann D. Luthi U. Meuli M. Altermatt S. Gobet R. Bruckner-Tuderman L. Steinmann B. J. Clin. Invest. 1996; 98: 1174-1184Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). Briefly, slides prepared as described above were washed with PBS, preincubated in 100 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8, 1% bovine serum albumin, 10 mm CaCl2 or 10 mm EDTA for 1 h at room temperature, and incubated with fluorescein-labeled cadaverine (Molecular Probes) in blocking buffer for 1 h at room temperature. After washing, microscopy was performed on a Zeiss microscope (Axiovert 135). In a first step to identify genes involved in the progression of follicle development, mRNAs isolated from three distinct pools of differently staged follicles (small white, <2 mm; large white, 2–4 mm; small yellow, 4–8 mm), covering phases 1 and 2 of follicle development, were subjected to differential mRNA display analysis (12Liang P. Pardee A.B. Science. 1992; 257: 967-971Crossref PubMed Scopus (4707) Google Scholar). We have isolated several fragments derived from genes that appeared up- or down-regulated as judged from the intensities on the gel, e.g. fragments 12 and 13 displayed in Fig.1 A. However, only six of these fragments (derived from mRNAs displayed using the given primer combination) exhibited differential expression, as evaluated by Northern blotting (Fig. 1, B and C). To obtain sequence information from the coding regions corresponding to the selected fragments, these fragments were used to screen a chicken follicle cDNA library (7Bujo H. Hermann M. Kaderli M.O. Jacobsen L. Sugawara S. Nimpf J. Yamamoto T. Schneider W.J. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 5165-5175Crossref PubMed Scopus (217) Google Scholar). BLAST searches against available data bases demonstrated that only one of the clones (number 12) was identical with a known chicken gene; it codes for a chicken chondrocyte transglutaminase (13Nurminskaya M. Linsenmayer T.F. Develop. Dyn. 1996; 206: 260-271Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar, 14Nurminskaya M. Magee C. Nurminsky D. Linsenmayer T.F. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 142: 1135-1144Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). Thus, we focused our attention on clone 12, and the sequence of the corresponding full-length transcript with a length of 4.5 kilobase pairs was obtained by 5′-RACE. The sequence defined an open reading frame of 2208 base pairs (GenBank™ accession number AJ278103). Sequence alignments (Fig.2) clearly identified the obtained cDNA as the chicken homologue of human factor XIIIA (15Grundmann U. Amann E. Zettlmeissl G. Kupper H.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1986; 83: 8024-8028Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar). The ATG serving as the translational start site was assigned based on the following considerations: First, it is located in a sequence context fulfilling the rules for a translation initiation site (16Kozak M. Nucleic Acids Res. 1987; 15: 8125-8132Crossref PubMed Scopus (4172) Google Scholar), and second, the corresponding chicken protein starts with the same sequence motif as human factor XIIIA (Fig. 2). The overall identity at the amino acid level between chicken and human factor XIIIA is 65%, displaying 100% identity around the active site cysteine, which catalyzes the acyl transfer reaction common to all transglutaminases (for review see Ref. 17Muszbek L. Adany R. Mikkola H. Crit. Rev. Clin. Lab. Sci. 1996; 33: 357-421Crossref PubMed Scopus (186) Google Scholar).Figure 2Sequence comparison of chicken and human factor XIIIA. Numbering of the amino acid sequences start at the methionine residue corresponding to the initiation codon. Gaps (−) have been introduced to optimize alignment. Identical residues in both proteins are boxed. The filled arrowhead marks the site where thrombin cleaves. The arrow marks the active site cysteine. The Ca2+-binding site isunderlined.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Mammalian plasma factor XIIIA is part of a large tetrameric complex consisting of two molecules of XIIIA and two molecules of XIIIB. The cellular form of factor XIIIA, however, is a homodimer consisting of two A subunits only. An interesting functional feature of human factor XIIIA is a thrombin cleavage site between Arg-37 and Glu-38 (see Fig. 2). Cleavage of FXIIIA by thrombin at this site leads to liberation of the amino-terminal so-called activation peptide and subsequently to the dissociation of the A and B subunits. Thus, in the absence of the inhibitory B subunits, the thrombin-modified A subunits assume a Ca2+-dependent active conformation catalyzing the cross-linking of fibrinogen to insoluble fibrin. To characterize the corresponding chicken protein further, we produced two antibodies directed against the putative activation peptide at the amino terminus (Ac16), and against the extreme carboxyl terminus of chicken XIIIA (A3), respectively. Using these antibodies in combination with a commercially available antibody against human XIIIA, we first characterized the plasma form of chicken XIIIA (Fig.3 A). Under non-reducing conditions, Ac16 recognizes all three forms of chicken factor XIIIA in plasma, i.e. the heterotetramer (2A2B), the homodimer (2A), and the monomer (A), respectively (lane 1). The occurrence of both the homodimer (2A) and the unclipped monomer (A) in plasma is due to the inherent instability of the tetrameric complex during electrophoresis. Under the same conditions, A3 and the commercial anti-human-XIIIA antibody recognize the heterotetramer in plasma (lanes 3 and 5). Independently of the enzyme's activation status, A3 reacts with the dimer as demonstrated by comparing plasma versus serum samples electrophoretically separated under non-reducing conditions (lanes 3 and4). A3 only weakly recognizes the monomer of chicken XIIIA under the conditions tested (the monomer becomes visible only after prolonged exposure, lane 3). Removal of the activation peptide and dissociation of the A and B subunits was demonstrated by the absence in serum of any detectable heterotetramer using A3 and anti-human XIIIA (lanes 4 and 6). In addition, under reducing conditions, all of the XIIIA present in plasma (i.e. not activated) migrates as monomer and is strongly recognized by Ac16 (lane 7). Upon activation, in serum, hardly any reactive band is visible under reducing conditions, indicating that the activation peptide is removed (lane 8). Upon prolonged exposure of the blot, however, a faint band with a size similar to that of the monomer becomes apparent; most likely it represents a small residual amount of non-activated XIIIA (also visible as dimer under non-reducing conditions in lane 2). Thus, activation of chicken factor XIII, as it occurs during blood clotting, obviously follows a similar process as described for mammals (17Muszbek L. Adany R. Mikkola H. Crit. Rev. Clin. Lab. Sci. 1996; 33: 357-421Crossref PubMed Scopus (186) Google Scholar). Having characterized the circulating forms of chicken factor XIIIA, we studied the protein produced by chicken follicles. Under both reducing and non-reducing conditions, the only band detected by Ac16 is the monomer, indicating that XIIIA is not associated with the B subunit and that follicular XIIIA does not form a dimer as it does in the circulation (Fig. 3 B, lane 1). This observation is substantiated by using A3, which reacts strongly with the dimer (2A) and the heterodimer of XIIIA (2A2B), but only weakly with the monomer (A), as demonstrated on plasma and serum samples. In the follicle this antibody visualizes only the monomer under the conditions applied (Fig.3 B, lanes 3 and 4). Human factor XIIIA does not contain a hydrophobic leader sequence and thus belongs to a group of proteins which are secreted from cells by an “unusual secretory pathway” (for review see Ref. 18Rubartelli A. Sita R. Kuchler K. Rubartelli A. Holland B. Unusual Secretory Pathways: From Bacteria to Man. Landes Bioscience, Austin, TX1997: 87-104Google Scholar). Chicken factor XIIIA also does not contain a hydrophobic leader sequence (Fig.2). To test whether chicken factor XIIIA can be secreted from cells, we expressed the full-length cDNA in 293 cells and tested for the expressed protein in cell extracts and the medium. As seen in Fig.4 A, transfected 293 cells express large amounts of monomeric chicken factor XIIIA (lane 2). Again, antibody A3 does not detect a band corresponding to the homodimer seen under the same conditions in the plasma (Fig. 4,lanes 4 and 6). Furthermore, significant amounts of the non-activated monomeric protein are indeed secreted into the medium, as demonstrated by immunoprecipitation experiments using Ac16 (Fig. 4 B, lanes 1–5). To evaluate the expression pattern of XIIIA in chicken tissues, we examined all major organs (follicle, eye, intestine, liver, kidney, muscle, brain, heart, lung, skin, adrenal, and spleen) and relevant cell lines by Northern blot analysis (data not shown). The only site in female chicken expressing detectable transcripts for factor XIIIA is the follicle and, of the cell lines tested, HD11 cells, a chicken macrophage cell line (19Leutz A. Beug H. Walter C. Graf T. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 3905-3911Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). From these experiments we conclude that in the chicken circulating factor XIIIA is highly homologous to human factor XIIIA and that it is associated into a tetrameric complex constituting plasma factor XIII in a similar way as described for the mammalian system. Expression analysis did not reveal where the circulating protein is produced. This situation is reminiscent of that in humans where the question about the site of synthesis of plasma-borne XIIIA is still not resolved (17Muszbek L. Adany R. Mikkola H. Crit. Rev. Clin. Lab. Sci. 1996; 33: 357-421Crossref PubMed Scopus (186) Google Scholar). However, the follicle produces the monomeric form of factor XIIIA, and its regulated expression during follicle development suggests that it plays a role in this complex process. To study this unexpected finding, we examined in close detail the expression pattern of follicular XIIIA during the entire sequence of follicle development, starting at phase 1 to the complete involution of the postovulatory follicle. Such an experiment is hampered by the fact that follicles taken from the last growth phase (F8–F1) contain up to 15 g of yolk. RNA preparation from such follicles is very inefficient, and data obtained cannot be quantified appropriately. Thus, we have included follicles from phase 1 up to the smallest follicles at the beginning of phase 3 (F8–F6), and representative postovulatory follicles covering the time period from after ovulation until almost complete resorption. Detailed evaluation on follicles during the last rapid growth phase will be presented in a separate experiment below. As shown in Fig. 5, transcripts for factor XIIIA are already present at the very beginning of follicle development, and the amount significantly increases until follicles reach the end of phase 2 (5–8 mm). This result confirms the initial finding from the differential mRNA display approach that led to the characterization of factor XIIIA in follicles. Apparently, mRNA levels decrease at the beginning of the rapid growth phase (approximately 8 mm) and further decrease after ovulation (Fig. 5,top). However, protein levels seem to increase during the last phase of follicle development, reach the highest levels shortly after ovulation, and stay high until the postovulatory tissue is completely resorbed (Fig. 5, bottom). This observation suggests that factor XIIIA is not catabolized during follicle development, but rather becomes deposited in the extracellular matrix of the follicle wall. To further evaluate this question and to pinpoint the site of synthesis of factor XIIIA in the follicle, we turned to the largest follicles (F4-F1) of the final growth phase. Despite problems to isolate RNA from follicles of this size, they can be dissected to separate and prepare the theca and granulosa cell layers free of most of the yolk (20Hermann M. Lindstedt K.A. Foisner R. Mörwald S. Mahon M.G. Wandl R. Schneider W.J. Nimpf J. FASEB J. 1998; 12: 897-903Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). RNA and protein extracts were prepared from these tissues and subjected to Northern and Western blot analysis. The most striking result from this experiment was that expression of factor XIIIA in the follicle is restricted to the theca layer and virtually absent from the granulosa cell layer (Fig.6 A). Immunohistochemical analysis of the follicles showed that factor XIIIA is present in the theca externa and in the basement membrane but not in theca interna (Fig. 6 B, Panels 1 and 2). Laminated staining of the theca externa, which is similar to that seen with anti-collagen-1 antibodies (Fig. 6 B, Panel 3) and anti-fibronectin antibodies (Fig. 6 B,Panel 4), together with the fact that granulosa cells do not express the protein, suggest that factor XIIIA is secreted from theca cells and deposited in the acellular matrix of the theca externa and possibly in the basement membrane.Figure 6Expression of factor XIIIA in follicles during the rapid growth phase. A, thecae and granulosa cell layers from follicles during their rapid growth phase (F1–F4) were obtained, and total RNA and protein extracts were prepared as described under “Experimental Procedures.” Total RNA (30 μg/lane) derived from the tissues indicated were subjected to Northern blotting. Protein extracts (5 μg/lane) from the same tissues were subjected to Western blot analysis using Ac16 as antibody as described under “Experimental Procedures.” B, immunohistochemistry (panels 1–4) was performed on cryostat section of a chicken follicle (6 μm) as described under “Experimental Procedures” using the indicated antibodies. Expressed factor XIIIA appears in green. Nuclei were counterstained with DAPI. Anatomically distinct parts of the follicles are indicated (TH ex, theca externa; TH in, theca interna;GC, granulosa cells; ★, basement membrane; ⋆, perivitelline membrane). Panel 5 represents an image from a light microscope (differential interference contrast) of a section of a paraffin-embedded follicle (6 μm).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) To evaluate whether factor XIIIA is enzymatically active in the matrix of the follicle wall, an activity assay based on fluorescein-labeled cadaverine as substrate was performed on thin sections of the follicle. Background labeling of the sections was controlled by using EDTA (Fig.7, A* and B*), which completely blocks the transglutaminase reaction. As seen in Fig.7 A, the distribution of the transglutaminase activity visualized by incorporation of the labeled substrate is identical with the distribution of the immunoreactive enzyme seen in Fig.6 B (Panels 1 and 2). Furthermore, the activity pattern is maintained in the early postovulatory follicle (Fig. 7 B), when the highest amount of factor XIIIA is present in the follicle (Fig. 5). Note that at this stage the perivitelline membrane is lost (together with the ovulated oocyte) and the granulosa cell layer starts to disintegrate, whereas the theca externa reaches its largest extension. Differential mRNA display screening for genes expressed during specific stages of chicken follicle development resulted in the identification of chicken factor XIIIA. The transglutaminase is expressed by cells of the theca externa and deposited in certain areas of the follicular wall. Usually, factor XIIIA is part of a large tetrameric complex consisting of two molecules of XIIIA and two molecules of XIIIB constituting plasma coagulation factor XIII. Upon activation by thrombin, factor XIII catalyzes the last step of the blood coagulation pathway by cross-linking soluble fibrin monomers to insoluble fibrin, which forms and stabilizes the final clot. Besides its abundant presence in plasma, factor XIIIA can also be found in certain cells like platelets (21Lopaciuk S. Lovette K.M. McDonagh J. Chuang H.Y. McDonagh R.P. Thromb. Res. 1976; 8: 453-465Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar), monocytes/macrophages (22Henriksson P. Becker S. Lynch G. McDonagh J. J. Clin. Invest. 1985; 76: 528-534Crossref PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar), and some mononuclear cells in the skin (23Cerio R. Spaull J. Oliver G.F. Jones W.E. Am. J. Dermatopathol. 1990; 12: 221-233Crossref PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar). The cellular form of factor XIII, however, is a homodimer consisting of two A subunits only. Although the presence of factor XIIIA in these cells has been known for many years, the function of this form is still unclear. Recent reports (13Nurminskaya M. Linsenmayer T.F. Develop. Dyn. 1996; 206: 260-271Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar, 14Nurminskaya M. Magee C. Nurminsky D. Linsenmayer T.F. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 142: 1135-1144Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar, 24Monsonego A. Mizrahi T. Eitan S. Moalem G. Bardos H. Adany R. Schwartz M. FASEB J. 1998; 12: 1163-1171Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar) suggest that plasma factor XIIIA has specialized functions in certain other tissues and cells independent of its function in the blood. It seems to be associated with peripheral nervous tissue and may play a role in the regeneration of this tissue after injury (24Monsonego A. Mizrahi T. Eitan S. Moalem G. Bardos H. Adany R. Schwartz M. FASEB J. 1998; 12: 1163-1171Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). These authors present circumstantial evidence that XIIIA is at least partially synthesized by macrophages present in the nervous tissue. Another interesting aspect of a “non-plasma” form of XIIIA is directly related to the results presented here. Subtractive hybridization to isolate genes involved in hypertrophy of chondrocytes in the chicken lead to the identification of plasma factor XIIIA (13Nurminskaya M. Linsenmayer T.F. Develop. Dyn. 1996; 206: 260-271Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar, 14Nurminskaya M. Magee C. Nurminsky D. Linsenmayer T.F. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 142: 1135-1144Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). During chondrocyte hypertrophy, factor XIIIA becomes up-regulated and externalized into the extracellular matrix, where it may serve to stabilize the matrix, which eventually undergoes calcification and the formation of bone structure. In the rat, however, expression of a tissue transglutaminase was described in terminally differentiating chondrocytes (25Aeschlimann D. Wetterwald A. Fleisch H. Paulsson M. J. Cell Biol. 1993; 120: 1461-1470Crossref PubMed Scopus (167) Google Scholar, 26Aeschlimann D. Kaupp O. Paulsson M. J. Cell Biol. 1995; 129: 881-892Crossref PubMed Scopus (182) Google Scholar). Whether factor XIIIA expression in chondrocytes is specific for chicken and whether both transglutaminases serve similar or different roles remain to be established. In any case, factor XIIIA deposited in hypertrophic cartilage in the chicken is not derived from the plasma pool but is directly synthesized by the chondrocytes (14Nurminskaya M. Magee C. Nurminsky D. Linsenmayer T.F. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 142: 1135-1144Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). What is the function of factor XIIIA in the developing chicken follicle? The answer to this question may lie in the architecture of this continuously changing organ. The structural integrity of the follicle, which reaches a diameter of up to 3 cm and holds a yolk volume of approximately 15 ml at its maximal size before ovulation, is supported mainly by the mechanical strength of the theca externa. This layer is predominantly composed of sheets of fibroblast-like cells embedded in sheets of collagen fibrils (1Perry M.M. Gilbert A.B. Evans A.J. J. Anat. 1978; 125: 481-497PubMed Google Scholar) and fibronectin (27Yoshimura Y. Okamoto T. Tamura T. Jpn. Poult. Sci. 1985; 22: 274-278Crossref Google Scholar), giving this layer its stratified appearance (see Fig. 6 B). The theca interna, however, contains many capillaries and cell clusters, which, due to their lipid granule content and rounded appearance, have been called thecal gland cells (28Dahl E. Z. Zellforsch.Mikrosk. Anat. 1970; 109: 195-211Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). These cells have been reported to be the main site of the production of progesterone and testosterone (29Porter T.E. Hargis B.M. Silsby J.L. Halawani M.E.E. Endocrinology. 1989; 125: 109-116Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar) and of alkaline phosphatase in the follicle (30Chapeau C. Engelhardt H. King G.J. Etches R.J. Poult. Sci. 1996; 75: 1536-1545Crossref PubMed Scopus (3) Google Scholar). In sharp contrast to the theca externa, intercellular spaces of the interna are less well structured and contain only a few scattered collagen fibrils. Very little is known about the structure, composition, and function of the basement membrane that delineates the theca from the granulosa cell layer. However, immunohistochemical studies suggest that this structure contains the extracellular matrix protein fibronectin (27Yoshimura Y. Okamoto T. Tamura T. Jpn. Poult. Sci. 1985; 22: 274-278Crossref Google Scholar), apparently produced by granulosa cells (31Asem E.K. Novero R.P. J. Reprod. Fertil. 1994; 101: 375-384Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The present immunohistochemical studies on the distribution of factor XIIIA in the chicken follicle (Fig. 6 B) demonstrate that this protein is present in the theca externa and possibly in the basement membrane, although this could be demonstrated only with one of the antibodies used (compare Fig. 6 A with 6B). Factor XIIIA is completely absent from the theca interna, the granulosa cell layer, and the perivitelline membrane. These results are supported by data obtained from expression studies showing that cells in the theca are the source of the protein. The possibility that factor XIIIA is at least partially recruited from the plasma cannot be excluded at this point. However, it seems rather unlikely, because factor XIIIA in plasma always exists as a heterotetramer complexed to factor XIIIB. Because we could not detect any such complexes in the follicle (Fig.3 B), we suggest that factor XIIIA found in the follicle wall is produced by cells within the follicle, as is the case in the calcifying cartilage discussed above. As shown in Fig. 6 B, the localization of XIIIA coincides with that of collagen-1 and fibronectin, both major extracellular matrix components of the theca externa. Because many extracellular matrix proteins, including collagen and fibronectin (32Mosher D.F. Fogerty F.J. Chernousov M.A. Barry E.L. Ann. N. Y. Acad. Sci. 1991; 614: 167-180Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar) are substrates for transglutaminases, we assume that factor XIIIA plays a central role in constructing and stabilizing the extracellular matrix of the theca externa. This may provide the mechanical strength necessary for progression through the rapid phase of oocyte growth. This assumption also applies to the integrity of the postovulatory follicle, which after loss of its balloon-like tension by expelling the oocyte, does not disintegrate right away but stays metabolically active for several more days (2Johnson A.L. Crit. Rev. Poult. Biol. 1990; 2: 319-346Google Scholar). There is another aspect about factor XIIIA function in the theca externa: It was recently shown that transglutaminases and especially factor XIIIA serve as substrates for cell adhesion (33Ueki S. Takagi J. Saito Y. J. Cell Sci. 1996; 109: 2727-2735Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Upon inspection of the ultrastructure of the theca externa (Fig. 6 B), it becomes obvious that most of this tissue is a matrix, with only a few cells scattered in this layer. On the other hand, a massive presence of factor XIIIA in this tissue suggests that it serves other functions than catalysis of cross-linking of matrix proteins. For instance, factor XIIIA may be a true structural component of the matrix-like fibronectin, serving as an anchor for the adhesion of the fibroblast-like cells present in this stratum. Finally, follicular factor XIIIA may also serve the same function as in the blood. Ovulation of the follicle is started by rupture of the theca along the stigma, a special region of the follicle that is almost devoid of blood vessels. However, small capillaries are expected to rupture upon ovulation and factor XIIIA in the follicular wall might prevent microbleeding during this event."

In this study, we randomly mutated two specific residues within the human RXRα identity box region previously identified as important determinants in heterodimerization (i.e. Ala416 and Arg421). Interestingly, most of these mutants still retained wild type interactions with thyroid hormone receptor (TR), retinoic acid receptor, peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor α, small heterodimer partner, and constitutive androstane receptor. However, RXR-A416D and R421L were specifically impaired for interactions with TR, whereas RXR-A416K lost both TR and retinoic acid receptor interactions. Accordingly, RXR-A416D did not support T3 transactivation in mammalian cells, whereas RXR-A416K was not supportive of transactivation by retinoids or T3. These results provide a basis upon which to further design mutant RXRs highly selective in heterodimerization, potentially useful tools to probe nuclear receptor function in vivo."
https://openalex.org/W2071956162,"<i>Rhodobacter sphaeroides</i> f. sp.<i>denitrificans</i> biotin sulfoxide reductase (BSOR) catalyzes the reduction of <i>d</i>-biotin <i>d</i>-sulfoxide (BSO) to biotin, an important step in oxidized vitamin salvaging. In addition to BSO, the enzyme also catalyzes the reduction of a variety of other substrates, including methionine sulfoxide, with decreased efficiencies, suggesting a potential role as a general cell protector against oxidative damage. Recombinant BSOR, expressed as a glutathione <i>S</i>-transferase fusion protein, contains the molybdopterin guanine dinucleotide cofactor (MGD) as its sole prosthetic group, which is required for the reduction of BSO by either NADPH or reduced methyl viologen. Comparison of the amino acid sequences of BSOR and the closely related MGD-containing enzyme, dimethyl sulfoxide reductase, has indicated a number of conserved residues, including an active site serine residue, serine 121, which has been potentially identified as the fifth coordinating ligand of Mo in BSOR. Site-directed mutagenesis has been used to replace serine 121 with cysteine, threonine, or alanine residues in the BSOR sequence to asses the role of this residue in catalysis and/or Mo coordination. All three BSOR mutant proteins were expressed, purified to homogeneity, and demonstrated to contain both MGD by fluorescence spectroscopy and Mo by inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry, similar to wild-type enzyme. However, all three mutant proteins were devoid of BSOR activity using either NADPH or reduced methyl viologen as the electron donor. These results strongly suggest that serine 121 in BSOR is essential for catalysis but is not essential for either Mo coordination or MGD binding."
