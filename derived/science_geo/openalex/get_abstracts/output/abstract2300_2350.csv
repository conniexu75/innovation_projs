https://openalex.org/W1568082126,"The application of 13-C nuclear magnetic resonance to the analysis of some sialic acid-containing meningococcal polysaccharide antigens is described. Complete assignments of the spectra of both the native serogroup B and the de-O-acetylated serogroup C polysaccharides have been made. These assignments were based on the corresponding data for some related monomers (sialic acid and its alpha-and beta-methylglycosides) and on supportive chemical evidence. The data indicate that the serogroup B polysaccharide is a 2 yields 8-alpha-linked homopolymer of sialic acid, identical in structure with colominic acid from Escherichia coli, whereas the de-O-acetylated serogroup C polysaccharide is a 2 yield 9-alpha-linked homopolymer. The native serogroup C polysaccharide is O-acetylated (1.16 mol of O-acetyl per sialic acid residue), all the O-acetyl substituents being located only at C-7 and C-8 of the sialic acid residues, and in addition contains unacetylated residues (24%). The polysaccharide contains di-O-acetylated residues (O-acetyl on C-7 and C-8), and at least one of the possible monoacetylated residues at C-7 or C-8."

https://openalex.org/W1550650979,"1. By the application of the principle of the sequential fragmentation of the respiratory chain, a simple-method has been developed for the isolation of phospholipid-depleted and phospholipid-rich cytochrome oxidase preparations. 2. The phospholip-rich oxidase contains about 20% lipid, including mainly phosphatidylethanolamine, phosphatidylcholine, and cardiolipin. Its enzymic activity is not stimulated by an external lipid such as asolectin. 3. The phospholipid-depleted oxidase contains less than 0.1% lipid. It is enzymically inactive in catalyzing the oxidation of reduced cytochrome c by molecular oxygen. This activity can be fully restored by asolectin; and partially restored (approximately 75%) by purified phospholipids individually or in combination. The activity can be partially restored also by phospholipid mixtures isolated from mitochondria, from the oxidase itself, and from related preparations. Among the detergents tested only Emasol-1130 and Tween 80 show some stimulatory activity. 4. The phospholipid-depleted oxidase binds with cytochrome c evidently by protein-protein interactions as does the phospholipid-rich or the phospholipid-replenished oxidase to form a complex with the ratio of cytochrome c to heme a of unity. The complex prepared from phospholipid-depleted cytochrome oxidase exhibits a characteristic Soret absorption maximum at 415 nm in the difference spectrum of the carbon monoxide-reacted reduced form minus the reduced form. This 415-nm maximum is abolished by the replenishment of the complex with a phospholipid or by the dissociation of the complex in cholate or in a medium of high ionic strength. When ascorbate is used as an electron donor, the complex prepared from phospholipid-depleted cytochrome oxidase does not cause the reduction of cytochrome a3 which is in dramatic contrast to the complex from the phospholipid-rich or the phospholipid-replenished oxidase. However, dithionite reduces cytochrome a3 in all of the preparations of the cytochrome c-cytochrome oxidase complex. These facts suggest that the action of phospholipid on the electron transfer in cytochrome oxidase may be at the step between cytochromes a and a3. This conclusion is substantiated by preliminary kinetic results that the electron transfer from cytochrome a to a3 is much slower in the phospholipid-depleted than in phospholipid-rich or phospholipid-replenished oxidase. On the basis of the cytochrome c content, the enzymic activity has been found to be about 10 times higher in the system with the complex (in the presence of the replenishedhe external medium unless energy is provided, and that"

The inability of four different stimulators to activate cyclic adenosine monophosphate synthesis in the variant, in contrast to its wild-type parent, implies that in normal cells one type of adenylate cyclase molecule can respond to different activators."
https://openalex.org/W1996047925,"A prolactin receptor, present in adult female rat liver, can be induced in males by estrogen. Hypophysectomy diminished receptor levels in the female and rendered males unresponsive to estrogen. A renal pituitary implant blunted the decrease in hypophysectomized females and induced the receptor in hypophysectomized males. The increased receptor level in hypophysectomized males with a renal pituitary implant was preceded by a sustained elevation of circulating prolactin. Our observations suggest that prolactin induces its own receptor."

The neurons were usually inhibited by norepinephrine and cyclic AMP, but excited by acetylcholine and cyclic GMP. These opposing responses of pyramidal tract neurons to cyclic AMP and cyclic GMP suggests that these two nucleotides could function as reciprocal intracellular second messengers for norepinephrine and acetylcholine, respectively."
https://openalex.org/W1527942330,"Proteoglycan aggregates from bovine articular cartilage have been visualized by electron microscopy of mixed proteoglycan-cytochrome c monolayers. The proteoglycan aggregates consist of proteoglycan subunits arising laterally at fairly regular intervals (20 to 30 nm) from the opposite sides of an elongated filamentous structure. The filamentous backbone in individual aggregates varies in length from 400 to 4000 nm. The individual proteoglycan subunits in the aggregate vary in length from 100 to 400 nm. However, there is no difference in the average size of the proteoglycan subunits associated with the largest or smallest aggregates. The sizes of the individual aggregates are determined mainly by the lengths of their filamentous backbones. The stoichiometry of binding of subunits to filament, calculated from the data reported here, is close to that for the binding of subunits to hyaluronic acid reported by others."
https://openalex.org/W1487187369,"Isoproterenol plus guanylyl imidodiphosphate (Gpp(NH)p) activate frog erythrocyte adenylate cyclase to a level much higher than the sum of the activities produced by the catecholamine and the synthetic nucleotide tested separately. Propranolol, the beta-receptor blocking agent, failed to inhibit activity when added after the enzyme system had been preincubated with both isoproterenol and Gpp(NH)p. However, if propranolol was added after only one of the two components had been added, it inhibited the effect of isoproterenol. Production of the propranolol-resistant state by treatment with isoproterenol and Gpp(NH)p did not require the presence of the productive substrate (MgATP). The activated propranolol-resistant state persisted following various treatments of the enzyme preparation including extensive washings of the membranes; considerable activity was retained even after sonication or treatment with the detergent Lubrol-PX, treatments which caused inactivation of the native enzyme. Extensive dilution of the membranes following pretreatment with isoproterenol and Gpp(NH)p did not significantly reduce to the activity of the enzyme. Readdition of isoproterenol after dilution caused some inhibition of adenylate cyclase activity, indicating apparently that the beta-receptor has not become inaccessible. In contrast, preincubation with isoproterenol alone failed to render the enzyme system refractive to propranolol, and dilution readily reduced the activity to negligibly low values. Preincubation with Gpp(NH)p alone also produced a persistent active state but the activity was much lower than that obtained throught the combined action of isoproterenol and Gpp(NH)p. The findings suggest that the hormone may be required only to facilitate the initial interaction of the enzyme with Gpp(NH)p. The differences, in this respect, between Gpp(NH)p and the more labile natural nucleotide, GTP, are discussed."
https://openalex.org/W1574229173,"Abstract The glucocorticoid receptor-glucocorticoid complex of the hepatic cytosol need undergo an to enable its binding to nuclei, chromatin, or stripped DNA. The conditions of this activation have been studied using native calf thymus DNA absorbed to cellulose. At low ionic strength, activation is very slow at 0 degrees, but, takes place rapidly at 25 degrees, reaching completion at 1 hour. Addition of 10 mm CaCl2 or 150 mm NaCl increases the rate of activation of the receptor at 0 degrees. Neither magnesium nor manganese ions can replace calcium with respect to enabling activation of the steroid-receptor complex to occur at low temperatures. Isofocusing studies reveal that the major component of the unactivated steroid-receptor complex has an isoelectric point of 7.1. Incubation of the steroid-receptor complex at 25 degrees for 30 min leads to its conversion to a form with an isoelectric point of 6.1 concurrent with the development of its ability to bind to DNA-cellulose. Sucrose density gradient analysis reveals that no detectable alteration in the sedimentation coefficient of the steroid-receptor complex occurs during its activation. MnCl2 (20mm) effeciently precipitates the unactivated hormone-receptor complex and to a lesser degree, precipitates the activated hormone-receptor complex."

Diseases that infect only man fall into two distinct categories. Those which can persist in an individual for a prolonged period are highly endemic, but those which are infectious only in the acute phase die out quickly after introduction. The suggestion is made that the latter diseases could not perpetuate themselves before the advent of advanced cultures and did not exert selective pressures on the human genetic constitution until relatively recently."
https://openalex.org/W1956849066,"Specific binding of 1alpha,25-dihydroxycholecalciferol to macromolecular components of small intestinal mucosa nuclei is demonstrated in vitamin D-deficient chicks. The nuclear 1alpha,25-dihydroxycholecalciferol-macromolecule complex was isolated on sucrose density gradients and sediments at 3.7 S in the presence of 0.3 M KCl. Agarose gel filtration of the nuclear component indicated an apparent molecular weight of 47,000. The nuclear receptor complexes could not be distinguished from previously described cytoplasmic 1alpha,25-dihydroxycholecalciferol-binding components by the ultracentrifugation and chromatographic procedures employed. The association of the 3-H-sterol with the nuclear component is thermolabile and is destroyed by treatment with pronase, but not by nucleases; the receptor component is therefore presumed to be a protein. The macromolecular-1alpha,25-dihydroxycholecalciferol complex formed in vivo or in vitro at 25 degrees can be extracted from intestinal nuclei by 0.3 M KCl, but not by low salt buffers. Smaller amounts of the 3.7 S binding component can be detected in isolated purified chromatin or after incubation of 1alpha,25-dihydroxy[3-H]cholecalciferol with reconstituted cytosol-chromatin at 0 degrees. Following incubation of the labeled hormone with reconstituted cytosol-chromatin at 0 degrees, 1alpha,25-dihydroxy[3-H]cholecalciferol is primarily associated with the cytoplasmic receptor, After shifting the incubation temperature to 25 degrees, a progressive increase in the concentration of the nuclear receptor complex and a concomitant decrease in the concentration of the cytoplasmic binding component occur. Thus the 1alpha,25-dihydroxycholecalciferol binding molecules appear to exist primarily in the cytoplasm, where they presumably function to transport the hormone into the nucleus. Experiments employing incubation of 1alpha,25-dihydroxy[3-H]cholecalciferol with reconstituted cytosol-chromatin from nontarget tissues indicate a requirement for both intestinal cytosol and chromatin for maximal formation of the nuclear hormone-receptor complex. These results suggest that the nuclear-binding component arises from hormone-dependent transfer of the cytoplasmic 1alpha,25-dihydroxycholecalciferol receptor to intestinal chromatin acceptor sites."

These increases are followed by dramatic increases in ornithine decarboxylase activity is due to new enzyme systhesis. The data suggest that the decarboxylase activity is regulated by an increase in cyclic AMP.
https://openalex.org/W1503919996,"A cell-free system prepared from the estrogen-primed chick oviduct was developed and used to study the uptake of cytoplasmic progesterone-receptor complex by isolated nuclei. The receptor and purified nuclei were shown to be stable at 25 degrees, but not at 37 degrees. Thus, nuclear incubations were routinely performed at 25 degrees. Such incubations revealed greater nuclear uptake of the cytoplasmic hormone-receptor complex as compared to control incubations performed at 0 degrees. The uptake process showed a quantitative preference for oviduct nuclei. No net uptake occurred during 0 degrees incubations when the nuclei were preincubated in the absence of cytoplasmic components at 25 degrees. In contrast, the temperature requirement was partially removed by preincubation of the hormone-receptor complex at 25 degrees prior to incubation with nuclei at 0 degrees. Nuclear uptake was not accompanied by measurable alterations in the sedimentation properties of the progesterone receptor. The activation and nuclear uptake of receptor was clearly dependent upon prior binding of steroid hormone to the receptor indicating that the active nuclear form of the receptor could not be generated in the absence of the hormone. Receptor precipitation with ammonium sulfate also partially removed the temperature requirement for nuclear binding. In contrast to temperature activation, ammonium sulfate precipitation activated the receptor in the absence of hormone. It thus seemed likely that temperature and salt activation of receptor occurred via different mechanisms. Although we were able to destroy up to 60% of the nuclear DNA content by treatment with DNase prior to nuclear incubation, some 80 to 85% of the receptor-binding capacity was still present in the treated nuclei. Thus, chick progesterone receptors apparently bind to a relatively DNase-resistant portion of the oviduct genome. The properties of this system indicate its value for further investigation into the initial events of progesterone action in the chick oviduct."
https://openalex.org/W1833105188,"We describe a convenient, rapid, and reproducible method for labeling proteins in vitro by acetylation with [3H] or [14-C]acetic anhydride dissolved in small amounts of anhydrous dioxane. The reaction is carried out at neutral pH and does not require the use of detergents, water-immiscible organic solvents, oxidizing, or reducing agents. Thus undesirable solvent-induced alterations in protein structure and biological activity are minimized. A method for calculating the specific activity of the protein and the efficiency of acetylation at known concentrations of protein and acetic anhydride is presented. Radioacetylated proteins were shown to be suitable for use as molecular weight calibration standards and as protein markers in polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, gel filtration, and enzyme studies. Acetic anhydride was used to label intact oncornaviruses, which consist of a complex ribonucleo-protein core within a lipid envelope. Some of the viral lipid and all of the viral proteins, including the internal ones, were labeled without detectable alterations in viral morphology or buoyant density. This result suggests that acetic anhydride, evidently by virtue of its small size and neutral charge, penetrates freely throughout the viral membrane and core structures. The reactivity of RNA with acetic anhydride was less than 1% that of protein under similar reaction conditions."
https://openalex.org/W1668153022,"In order to study the role of the individual subunits of yeast cytochrome c oxidase, rabbit antisera were prepared against Subunit II (a mitochondrially made polypeptide) and Subunit VI (a cytoplasmically made polypeptide). Antisera were also obtained against a mixture of the two mitochondrially made subunits (I PLUS II) and against mixtures of the following cytoplasmically made subunits: (IV PLUS VI); (V PLUS VII); and (IV PLUS V PLUS VI PLUS VII). Neither anti-II serum nor anti-VI serum cross-reacted with any of the other six subunits of cytochrome c oxidase as judged by a sensitive ring test or by double diffusion in agarose gels. Anti-II serum inhibited the oxidation of ferrocytochrome c by purified yeast cytochrome c oxidase or by freshly isolated as well as sonically fragmented yeast mitochondria. Anti-(V, VII) serum and anti-(IV, V, VI, VII) serum were also strongly inhibitory. Anti-VI serum and anti-(IV, VI) serum inhibited only weakly. If purified cytochrome c oxidase was inhibited with a saturating amount of anti-VI serum, anti-II serum elicited a further increment of inhibition, as would be expected if the inhibitory effects of these two antisera involved different antigenic sites on the holoenzyme. Each of the antisera precipitated all seven cytochrome c oxidase subunits from crude mitochondrial extracts. However, anti-VI and, particularly, anti-II were much less effective precipitants than antisera against Subunits IV to VII or antisera against the holoenzyme. These data suggest that the oxidation of ferrocytochrome c by cytochrome c oxidase required both mitochondrially as well as cytoplasmically made subunits."
https://openalex.org/W2023675771,"The virion-associated RNA-dependent RNA polymerase of vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV) synthesizes in vitro two size classes of RNA products similar to those observed in VSV-infected cells. One RNA product sediments at 31S with an approximate molecular weight of 2.1 X 106. The smaller products consist of at least three classes of RNA sedimenting at 17S, 14.5S, and 12S with molecular weights of 0.7 X 106, 0.52 X 106, and 0.37 X 106, respectively. Hybridization experiments show that both the 31S and 12-18S RNA products are complementary to the genome RNA, and that each class is transcribed from different nucleotide sequences. From the molecular weights of the RNA species and the hybridization experiments, it seems that almost the entire VSV genome RNA is transcribed in vitro."

https://openalex.org/W1511707645,"The role of Ca2+ on insulin release has been studied by the use of ionophore A23187. The ionophore complexes divalent cations and permits Ca2+ entry into cells by acting as a carrier in the plasma membranes. Cultured cells obtained by enzymatic digestion of pancreases from newborn rats were studied on the 3rd day of culture. With Ca2+ in the incubation medium the ionophore induced sustained insulin release even in the absence of glucose. Optimal effects of the ionophore were observed at 3 and 10 mug per ml in the presence of 0.3 to 1.0 mM Ca-2+. Under these conditions the insulin release was greater than that caused by 16.7 mM glucose. A graded response was observed to changes in Ca-2+ concentration from 0.1 to 1.0 mM Ca-2+. Higher Ca-2+ concentrations caused a large amount of insulin to be released promptly, but the release was not sustained. Mg-2+ and Sr-2+ were not found to substitute for Ca-2+. Ba-2+ at 0.3 mM stimulated insulin release even in the absence of ionophore. Cyclic adenosine 3':5'-monophosphate was able to increase ionophore-induced insulin release. The alpha-adrenergic effect of epinephrine to inhibit insulin release was not observed in the presence of Ca-2+ and the ionophore, and a stimulatory effect of epinephrine was seen. This unusual stimulatory effect of epinephrine was blocked by propranolol indicating a beta-adrenergic mechanism for epinephrine. It is concluded that Ca-2+, which plays an essential role in the stimulus-secretion coupling, can alone initiate and cause sustained insulin release."

https://openalex.org/W1573627148,"A cell-free system was used to study the kinetics of progesterone-receptor interaction with purified nuclei prepared from estrogen-primed chick oviducts. The binding process was a saturable phenomenon in both target and nontarget tissues. More nuclear acceptor sites were available to target tissue (similar to 9000 sites per oviduct nucleus) than in nontarget tissues (similar to 1000 to 3000 sites per nucleus), but the binding constant was essentially the same (Kd similar to 10-8 M). A second much smaller class of higher affinity sites (Kd similar to 10-11M) may exist. Its presence was detected by Scatchard plot nonlinearity at very low concentrations of added receptor-hormone complex (similar to 10-10 to 10-12M). The current study focused on the prevalent class of acceptor sites which was more readily detectable. Receptor binding to these sites was highly sensitive to salt. More sites were exposed at 25 degrees than at 0 degrees. Binding to these sites was inhibited in a nonselective fashion by the addition of protein. Although receptors may be activated by temperature or conditions of high ionic strength, these conditions could not capacitate more than 30 to 40% of the progesterone-receptor proteins for binding. Rate studies suggested that temperature plays a minimal role in nuclear uptake of activated receptors. Such a finding is consistent with a diffusion-limited uptake process."

L., Poyton, R. O., Wharton, D.C., and Schatz, G. (1973) J. Biol. Chem. 248, 1346-1354 and Poyton, R. O., and Schatz, G. (1975) J. Biol. Chem. 250, 752-761). In order to explore the arrangement of these subunits in the holoenzyme, the reactivity of each subunit with a variety of was tested with isolated cytochrome c oxidase, with cytochrome c oxidase incorporated into liposomes, and with mitochondrially bound cytochrome c oxidase. The surface probes included iodination with lactoperoxidase and coupling with p-diazonium benzenesulfonate. In addition, external subunits were identified by linking them to bovine serum albumin carrying a covalently bound isocyanate group. In the membrane-bound enzyme, Subunit I was almost completely inaccessible and Subunit II was partly inaccessible to all surface probes. All of the other subunits were accessible. Similar results were obtained with the solubilized enzyme, except that the differences in reactivity between the individual subunits were less clear-cut. The results obtained with liposome-bound cytochrome c oxidase resembled those obtained with the mitochondrially bound enzyme. These data suggest that the two largest mitochondrially made subunits are localized in the interior of the enzyme and that they are genuine components of cytochrome c oxidase."

https://openalex.org/W1509404973,"The stringent factor from Escherichia coli is the product of the relA locus. It is the enzyme that catalyzes the synthesis of pppGpp and ppGpp eliciting a pyrophosphate transfer from ATP to the 3'--OH of GTP (or GDP). This protein is responsible for the synthesis of pppGpp and ppGpp in stringent strains in response to an amino acid starvation. In vitro it catalyzes the synthesis of these guanosine compounds in either a ribosome-dependent reaction that requires a particular conformation of the ribosome i.e. the presence of an uncharged tRNA recognizing a codon in the acceptor (A) site of the ribosome or in a ribosome-independent reaction at temperatures under 30 degrees in the presence of only buffer, salts, and substrates. Here we report the purification of the stringent factor to near homogeneity. It is a monomeric protein with a molecular weight of 75,000. The properties of the ribosome-independent reaction are studied and it is shown that the presence of certain acidic proteins, such as the 50 S ribosomal proteins L7 and L12 or casein, or 20% methanol or both stimulates the reaction by creating an environment that together with the low temperature further stabilizes the stringent factor."

The [3H]cortisol-binding molecule had an apparant Kd value of 1.7 times 10-7 M and the number of binding sites was 0.99 pmol per mg of cytosol protein. Only a single class of [3H]cortisol-binding sites could be detected, whose protein nature was suggested by its susceptibility to nagarse. The [3H]cortisol-protein complex sedimented at similar to 4 S in a 5 to 20% sucrose gradient either in the presence or absence of 0.3 M KCl. Binding increased more than 2-fold in adrenalectomized rats and was markedly reduced in the muscle of rats pretreated with cortisol. In contrast to the binding of [3H]dexamethasone and [3H]triamcinolone acetonide to receptor proteins in muscle, no correlation was found between the ability of various steroids to complete wtth [3H]cortisol binding and their glucocorticoid potency: [3H]cortisol binding was inhibited by a 1000-fold higher concentration of unlabeled cortisol and progesterone but not by dexamethasone or triamcinolone acetonide. It is therefore suggested that the [3H]cortisol-binding reaction is not directly involved in the biological effects of all potent glucocorticoids in skeletal muscle. The [3H]cortisol-binding protein in muscle cytosol could not be unequivocally distinguished from rat plasma corticosteroid-binding globulin, because both had similar steroid specificity and temperature stability, were not markedly affected by--SH reagents, and displayed similar sedimentation properties."
https://openalex.org/W1560205634,"4-Nitrocatechol is examined as an active site probe for non-heme iron dioxygenases and found to be of value, particularly with those containing iron in the Fe(II) oxidation state. 4-Nitrocatechol is astrong competitive inhibitor of substrate oxygenation by protocatechuate 3,4-dioxygenase, forming a reversible complex with this enzyme, and by pyrocatechase. The number of binding sites per enzyme molecule titrated spectrophotometrically with 4-nitrocatechol agrees with results from previous studies with either the principal substrate or other analogues, as expected of an effective probe. Despite these facts and the observation that both enzymes cleave the same substrates at the same carbon-carbon bond, the optical and electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) spectra of their 4-nitrocatechol complexes are remarkably different. The 4-nitocatechol-protocatechuate 3,4-dioxygenase optical spectra resemble that of the 4-nitrocatecholate ion shifted 20 to 30 nm to longer wavelength. Concomitant with this change the EPR signal centered at g equal 4.28 shows increased rhombicity (g values at 4.74, 4.28, and 3.74).In contrast, the spectrum of the 4-nitrocatechol-pyrocatechase complex has a maximum at the same wavelength as that of a 1:1 solution of free Fe(II) and 4-nitrocatechol in the absence of enzyme after titration of the catecholic protons with base and the g equal 4.28 EPR signal is not resolved at liquid N-2 temperature. These changes are interpreted as resulting in part from a pronounced change in the ligand fields about the irons at the active sites which in the case of protocatechuate 3,4-dioxygenase leads to enzyme inactivation. The results also are the first indication that substrate analogues change their ionization form upon complexation with Fe (III) dioxygenases. The interaction of the probe with metapyrocatechase, an Fe(III) containing dioxygenase, and with several additional oxygenases and hydroperoxidases is also briefly examined. The probe is not specific for any particular class of non-heme iron dioxygenases."

The oxidation did, however, abolish the interaction of soybean agglutinin with concanvalin A, as measured by quantitative precipitation. Reduction with sodium [3-H]borohydride of soybean agglutinin in which 4 out of 9 mannose residues per subunit were oxidized, afforded a radioactive product which retained full hemagglutinating activity and was indistinguishable from the native lectin by gel filtration, gel electrophoresis, and affinity chromatography. These results establish that the integrity of the carbohydrate side chain of soybean agglutinin is not essential for the biological activity of the lectin, and suggest a general method for the preparation of radioactive glycoprotein lectins."
https://openalex.org/W1505215310,"Earlier studies from this laboratory have shown that cytochrome c oxidase from bakers' yeast contains seven subunits, three of which are made in the mitochondrion (Mason, T. L., and Schatz, G. (1973) J. Biol. Chem. 248, 1355). Moreover, a cytochrome c oxidase-less yeast mutant (pet 494-1) was isolated which lacked one of the mitochondrially made subunits (Ebner, E., Mason, T. L., and Schatz, G. (1973) J. Biol. Chem. 248, 5369). Surprisingly, the mutated gene was localized in the nucleus. The results presented here demonstrate that this mutant phenotype can be suppressed by nuclear amber suppressors which affect translation on cytoplasmic ribosomes. This fact was established by two methods, (a) By constructing pet 494-1 strains possessing various amber and ochre markers, isolating respiring revertants from these strains, and demonstrating co-reversion of the amber (but not of the ochre) markers. (b) By coupling the pet 494-1 allele with the well characterized amber suppressor gene SUP 4-3. These data show that suppressor genes located on nuclear chromosomes may control the accumulation of a mitochondrially synthesized polypeptide. The present results also allow some tentative conclusions about the mechanism of the pet 494 mutation. Because it is highly unlikely that the cytoplasmic and the mitochondrial translation system share a common suppressor, the pet 494 locus probably does not code for the missing mitochondrially made subunit, but for a cytoplasmically made protein. This as yet unidentified protein seems to control the synthesis or the integration of the mitochondrially made subunit. Nuclear suppressor genes may thus be useful tools for studying the role of cytoplasmic protein synthesis in mitochondrial formation."

With lambdah80dlacPs DNA as template, ppGpp together with TFms stimulated gal RNA synthesis to a much greater extent than total RNA synthesis. The stimulation of both lac and gel RNA synthesis was increased in the presence of cyclic AMP receptor and cyclic AMP."
https://openalex.org/W1488436044,"The inhibition of proteolytic enzymes by protein inhibitors is accompanied by the formation of unusually stable complexes. The recognition of a specific substrate-like amino acid on the inhibitor is believed to be the initial event of the inhibitory process. In addition to the interactions involved in the binding of a good substrate, a variety of other noncovalent interactions are known to stabilize the complex. The formation of stable complexes between several inactive derivatives of proteolytic enzymes and a variety of protein inhibitors suggests strongly that the formation of any species resembling catalytic intermediates is unnecessary for inhibition. We have examined the interaction between several avian ovomucoids and alpha-chymotrypsin in which histidine-57 has been converted to 3-methylhistidine-57. This derivative is easily prepared and can be isolated by affinity chromatography. Methylchymotrypsin retains unaltered its ability to bind specific substrates, but is essentially inactive. In spite of this loss of enzymatic activity, methylchymotrypsin forms strong complexes with several inhibitors. In addition, methylchymotrypsin which has been covalently linked to Sepharose is particularly useful for the isolation of protein inhibitors without the complications due to isolation of a mixture of partially cleaved forms of the inhibitor."
https://openalex.org/W1635998913,"High resolution electron spin resonance spectra of the stepwise formation of CN- complexes of Co(II) and Cu(II) carbonic anhydrase show that both metal enzymes form successive 1:1 and 2:1 addition products with CN- at 112 K. The 1:1 complex with the Cu(II) enzyme has a rhombic ESR spectrum similar to the spectra of the 1:1 complexes of the Cu(II) enzyme with CH3COO-, OCN-, N3-, and SH-. The 1:1 complex with the CO(II) enzyme shows a broad resonance at 10 K indicating the presence of high spin Co(II). Previous optical, ESR, and magnetic susceptibility data suggest that the 1:1 complexes are 4-coordinate. At high concentrations of 13CN- the Cu(II) enzyme forms a 2:1 CN- complex with a shift to an axial ESR signal showing ligand nuclear superhyperfine structure from two magnetically equivalent equatorial nitrogen nuclei of the protein and two magnetically equivalent equatorial carbon ligands from two 13CN- anions. Under the same conditions a structurally analogous dicyanide complex of the co(II) enzyme forms with the appearance of and axial ESR signal typical of low spin Co(II). Ligand nuclear superhyperfine structure shows the presence of an axial protein nitrogen as ligand and two magnetically equivalent equatorial carbon ligands from two 13CN- anions. The dicyanide complexes of the Co(II) and Cu(II) enzymes form completely only in frozen solutions and analysis of the ESR spectra show them to have a 5-coordinate square pyrimidal geometry. Comparison of the ligand superhyperfine structure on the ESR signals of both dicyanide complexes shows that there are three nitrogen nuclei of the protein present as ligands at the metal binding site; one axial and two equatorial in the dicyanide complexes. A transient 5-coordinate intermediate might play a role in the mechanism of action of carbonic anhydrase by facilitating ligand exchange reactions within the inner coordination sphere of the Zn(II) ion at the active center."
https://openalex.org/W1601559445,"A complex of the electron-rich ion Cu(I) with the flavoquinone analogue 10-methylisoalloxazine has been synthesized and characterized by x-ray methods. The complex is unstable to oxygen. It is black-green in color, in contrast with the bright yellow, orange, or orange-brown crystalline complexes of 10-methylisoalloxazine or riboflavin with Cu(II), Ag(I), and Pb(II). These results are indicative of strong perturbation of the flavin electronic structure by the Cu(I) ion and suggest that this complex is a reasonable model for incipient transfer of an electron from a reduced metal to flavoquinone. the crystal structure is orthorhombic, Pna2-1, with unit cell constants a = 31.24(1) (figures in parentheses are estimated standard deviations), b = 12.862(4), c = 6.239(2) A, Pobs = 1.76 g per cm-3 and Pcalc = 1.77 g per cm-3 for Z = 4 and asymmetric formula CuClO4-2(C11H8N4O2). HCOOH. The final R factor based on 1250 counter-measured data is 8.8%. The 2 independent 10-methylisoalloxazine molecules, A and B, bind strongly to the cuprous ion throug N(5) of each flavin. The copper is approximately linearly coordinated with an N-Cu-N angle of 153(1) degrees, and Cu-N(5) distances of 1.94(2) A and 1.92(2) A. The next nearest atoms to Cu are the O(4) oxygens of each flavin, forming weak bonds with distances Cu-O(4) = 2.27(2) A and 2.21(2) A for molecules A and B. The dihedral angle between the 2 10-methylisoalloxazine molecules is 65.4 degrees."

https://openalex.org/W1566967738,"The binding of metal to alkaline phosphatase from Escherichia coli and the binding of water and orthophosphate to the Me-2+-enzyme binary complex have been examined by water proton relaxation rate (PRR) measurements. Titration of the three paramagnetic metals, Mn2+, Cu2+, and Co2+, into apoalkaline phosphatase and the titrations of apoenzyme into metal have been carried out. Analysis of the spin-lattice relaxation rates for these titrations and of Scatchard binding curves derived from these results, as well as EPR data, show four tight manganese sites, between two and three tight copper sites, or four cobalt sites per enzyme dimer of molecular weight 80,000. The multiple sites for each metal are indistinguishable by these magnetic resonance techniques. Both the spin-lattice- and spin-spin-relaxation rates exhibit a negative temperature coefficient, showing that these processes are not exchange-limited. From a frequency dependence study of T-1 and from the T-1:T-2 ratio measured at 220 MHz, correlation times from the water-enzyme complexes have been estimated. For H20-Mn-2+-alkaline phosphatase, gamma c equals 1.55 times 10-9 s; for H20-Cu-2+ -alkaline phosphatase, gamma c equals 1.82 times 10-s; and for the cobalt complex, gamma c equals 1.0 times 10-12 s at 4 degrees. Assuming 1 water molecule bound per metal site, these correlation times correspond to the following water-metal distances: gamma (A) is 4.0 A for Mn-2+-H20, 3.4 A for Cu-2+-H20, and 2.8 A for Co-2+-H20. Thus, water is shown to bind directly to the metal atoms of alkaline phosphatase. The correlation between the length of the water-metal bond and the relative activity of the various metalloenzymes support the importance of this binding in the monophosphoesterase reaction catalyzed by alkaline phosphatase. Addition of excess orthophosphate to any of the water-metalloenzyme complexes does not displace an exchangeable water molecule from the metal site. The Mn-PO-4 distance which we have reported earlier (Zukin, R.S., Hollis, D.P., and Gray, G.A. (1973) Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 53, 238) to be 7.3 A is consistent with this finding and suggests a model in which Pi binds to Mn-2+-alkaline phosphatase through a water bridge."

This effect is absent in rats that are also adrenalectomized. Potassium chloride fails to facilitate lordosis in estrogen-primed rats, with intact adrenals, which are pretreated with dexamethasone, an inhibitor of the release of adrenocorticotropic hormone. Adrenalectomized rats that have been treated with dexamethasone are capable of responding to progesterone with the display of lordosis. The results suggest that application of potassium chloride to the neocortex acts as a stressor that causes the release of adrenal progestin."

https://openalex.org/W1484289957,"The techniques of fluorescence enhancement, fluorescence quenching, fluorescence polarization, and equilibrium dialysis are utilized to study the binding properties of coenzyme to horse liver alcohol dehydrogenase. Polarization of fluorescence and equilibrium dialysis show that NADH binds to alcohol dehydrogenase with a stoichiometry of 6 mol per mol of enzyme, in contrast to the value of 2 determined from fluorescence enhancement measurements. NAD+ also binds with a stoichiometry of six as was determined by equilibrium dialysis. The two NADH sites which bind coenzyme more tightly and which are revealed by fluorescence enhancement measurements are designated the catalytic sites. Binding of coenzyme to the four ancillary sites does not alter the quantum yield of NADH but results in a 20% contribution to quenching of enzyme's tryptophan fluorescence. From the emission anisotropy of bound NADH of 24.0% for the additional sites and 28.1% for the catalytic sites and their relative fluorescence lifetimes at the same wavelengths of excitation and emmision, we conclude that the nicotinamide ring of NADH bound to the additional sites exhibits a freedom of motion independent of the macromolecule, while that bound to the catalytic sites is more rigidly held. Polarization of fluorescence yields negative intrinsic free energies of 9.2 and 7.5 Cal M-1 for NADH interaction with the catalytic and additional sites, respectively. Although these values are 1.3 to 2.0 Cal higher than those determined by fluorescence quenching and equilibrium dialysis, the mean Hill coefficient of 1.76 plus or minus 0.06, the titration span of 2.4 logarithmic units and coupling free energies (in magnitude and sign) are the same for all these techniques. The above difference in the intrinsic free energies are attributed largely to the different modes of interaction of excited and unexcited NADH molecules with alcohol dehydrogenase."
https://openalex.org/W1544201656,"In turkey erythrocytes bidirectional fluxes of sodium and potassium develop a time-dependent refractoriness to stimulation by endogenous cyclic adenosine 3':5'-monophosphate (cyclic AMP). The refractoriness of potassium influx and potassium outflux (both of which require extracellular sodium and potassium for stimulation by cyclic AMP) depends on the extracellular concentrations of sodium and potassium. In contrast, the refractoriness developed by sodium outflux (which does not require extracellular sodium or potassium for stimulation by cyclic AMP) does not depend on the extracellular concentrations of sodium or potassium. The refractoriness of these fluxes to cellular cyclic AMP reflects a decrease in the amount by which they can be maximally stimulated and appears to be proportional to the extent to which the transport system is utilized during the course of the incubation. Ouabain significantly reduces the rate at which cation transport in turkey erythrocytes becomes refractory to endogenous cyclic AMP. This effect of the glycoside is independent of the extracellular concentrations of sodium or potassium and does not correlate with how it alters the initial response of the transport systems to cyclic AMP."
https://openalex.org/W1585550291,"The dehydrogenase activity of the aspartokinase I-homoserine dehydrogenase I complex isolated from Escherichia coli K12 is subject to a cooperative activation by K+ or Rb+, which is characterized by a Hill coefficient of approximately 2. Ionic strength has little effect on the Hill coefficient for this activation process; however, high ionic strength appears to increase the enzyme's affinity for K+ and decrease its affinity for Rb+. The Vmax of the K+-activated dehydrogenase is greater than that of the Rb+-activated dehydrogenase. The results of a study of the competition between K+ and Rb+ in the activation process suggest the presence of an activated species containing both K+ and Rb+. The cooperative activation by K+ is antagonized by Na+ via a process that is noncooperative with respect to Na+. The MgATP-2- complex, a substrate for the kinase activity of aspartokinase I-homoserine dehydrogenase I, has a marked effect on the K+ activation of the dehydrogenase activity. Kinetic studies of this effect of MgATP-2- on the K+ requirement of the dehydrogenase at pH 8.9 indicate that: (a) activation by a monovalent cation is essential in the presence as well as in the absence of MgATP-2-; (b) the concentration of K+ required to activate fully the dehydrogenase is reduced in the presence of MgATP-2-; (c) activation of the dehydrogenase by K+ is noncooperative in the presence of MgATP-2-; and (d) the maximum velocity for the dehydrogenase catalyzed oxidation of homoserine is greater in the presence of MgATP-2- than in its absence. Based on these results, a simple model consistent with these data is proposed. Destruction of the kinase activity and the threonine sensitivity of the aspartokinase-homoserine dehydrogenase complex by treatment with 5,5'-dithiobis(2-nitrobenzoic acid) or by incubation at pH 9 also converts the K+ activation of the dehydrogenase from a cooperative to a noncooperative process. Marked protection of the enzyme against loss of threonine sensitivity at pH 9 is afforded by MgATP-2- plus K+ and homoserine. The apparent molecular radius of the enzyme complex as determined by gel filtration at pH 8.85 in the presence of threonine or MgATP-2- plus K+ and homoserine is dependent on the enzyme concentration. The observed apparent molecular radii of 70 A at high enzyme concentrations and 61 A at low enzyme concentrations are consistent with the enzyme's undergoing a concentration-dependent dissociation from a tetrameric to a dimeri"
https://openalex.org/W1570386476,"The adenylate cyclase system present in a preparation enriched in plasma membranes derived from bovine adrenal cortex was investigated in considerable detail. This system is stimulated by adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH), by biologically active analogs of this hormone, and by fluoride ion. The preparation contains sodium-potassium- and magnesium-dependent ATPases that are markedly inhibited by 50 mM sodium fluoride. Incorporation of a pyruvate phosphokinase ATP generating system into the adenylate cyclase assay medium provided constant substrate levels. In the presence of the ATP generating system, the rate of cyclic AMP formation (basal, fluoride, and ACTH-activated) was proportional to enzyme concentration and was linear with time. Proportionality with respect to enzyme concentration as concerned the hormone-activated adenylate cyclase was achieved only when the ratio of hormone to enzyme protein was kept constant. The temperature optimum of the adenylate cyclase, basal or activated, was approximately 30 degrees. Michaelis-Menten kinetics were observed when the ratio of Mg2+ to ATP was approximately 6:1. Both calcium and ethylene glycol bis(beta-aminoethyl ether)-N,N'-tetraacetic acid completely inhibited the adenylate cyclase system at concentrations of 5 and 0.5 mM, respectively. GTP was inhibitory at concentrations of 10-2 M but had little effect at lower concentrations. Freezing in liquid nitrogen and storage at -60 degrees exerted little effect on the fluoride-stimulated enzyme but lowered hormone stimulated activity. Preincubation in the presence of ACTH afforded a high degree of stabilization of the enzyme system while preincubation with a biologically inactive analog afforded no protection."

The molar ratio bound 3-pyridinealdehyde-NAD to the enzyme is 2.5 to 2.9. Lactate, malate, and alcohol dehydrogenases do not form acid-precipitable complexes with 3-pyridinealdehyde-NAD. 3-Pyridinealdehyde-deamino-NAD or glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate also forms an acid-stable complex with glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate dehydrogenase; however, NAD, 3-acetylpyridine-NAD, or thionicotinamide-NAD does not produce an acid-stable complex. Incubation of the glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate dehydrogenase with glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate, acetyl phosphate, iodoacetic acid, or iodosobenzoate inhibits the formation of the acid-stable complex with 3-pyridinealdehyde-NAD. Glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate or 3-pyridinealdehyde-NAD also prevents carboxymethylation of the active site cysteine-149 by[14-C]iodoacetic acid. These studies indicate that the aldehyde group of 3-pyridinealdehyde-NAD forms a thiohemiacetal linkage with cysteine-149 which is the substrate binding site for the dehydrogenase reaction. These findings may account for the fact that 3-pyridinealdehyde-NAD strongly inhibits the dehydrogenase and esterase activities of 3-pyridinealdehyde-NAD forms a thiohemiacetal linkage with cysteine-149 which is the substrate binding site for the dehydrogenase reaction. These findings may account for the fact that 3-pyridinealdehyde-NAD strongly inhibits the dehydrogenase and esterase activities of glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate dehydrogenase which require reduced cysteine-149. However, the analogue does not inhibit the acetyl phosphates activity of the enzyme for which the active site sulfhydryl residues must be oxidized."
