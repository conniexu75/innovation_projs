They exhibit phenotypes of both hepatocytes and bile ducts. However, their origin and their significance to injury repair remain unclear. Here, we used a chimeric lineage tracing system to demonstrate that hepatocytes contribute to the progenitor pool. RNA-sequencing, ultrastructural analysis, and in vitro progenitor assays revealed that hepatocyte-derived progenitors were distinct from their biliary-derived counterparts. In vivo lineage tracing and serial transplantation assays showed that hepatocyte-derived proliferative ducts retained a memory of their origin and differentiated back into hepatocytes upon cessation of injury. Similarly, human hepatocytes in chimeric mice also gave rise to biliary progenitors in vivo. We conclude that human and mouse hepatocytes can undergo reversible ductal metaplasia in response to injury, expand as ducts, and subsequently contribute to restoration of the hepatocyte mass."
https://openalex.org/W2161811299,"Background Over the last decade, there has been growing concern about ‘gaming addiction’ and its widely documented detrimental impacts on a minority of individuals that play excessively. The latest (fifth) edition of the American Psychiatric Association's Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM-5) included nine criteria for the potential diagnosis of Internet Gaming Disorder (IGD) and noted that it was a condition that warranted further empirical study. Aim: The main aim of this study was to develop a valid and reliable standardised psychometrically robust tool in addition to providing empirically supported cut-off points. Methods A sample of 1003 gamers (85.2% males; mean age 26 years) from 57 different countries were recruited via online gaming forums. Validity was assessed by confirmatory factor analysis (CFA), criterion-related validity, and concurrent validity. Latent profile analysis was also carried to distinguish disordered gamers from non-disordered gamers. Sensitivity and specificity analyses were performed to determine an empirical cut-off for the test. Results The CFA confirmed the viability of IGD-20 Test with a six-factor structure (salience, mood modification, tolerance, withdrawal, conflict and relapse) for the assessment of IGD according to the nine criteria from DSM-5. The IGD-20 Test proved to be valid and reliable. According to the latent profile analysis, 5.3% of the total participants were classed as disordered gamers. Additionally, an optimal empirical cut-off of 71 points (out of 100) seemed to be adequate according to the sensitivity and specificity analyses carried. Conclusions The present findings support the viability of the IGD-20 Test as an adequate standardised psychometrically robust tool for assessing internet gaming disorder. Consequently, the new instrument represents the first step towards unification and consensus in the field of gaming studies."
https://openalex.org/W2093088433,"Aspartame consumption is implicated in the development of obesity and metabolic disease despite the intention of limiting caloric intake. The mechanisms responsible for this association remain unclear, but may involve circulating metabolites and the gut microbiota. Aims were to examine the impact of chronic low-dose aspartame consumption on anthropometric, metabolic and microbial parameters in a diet-induced obese model. Male Sprague-Dawley rats were randomized into a standard chow diet (CH, 12% kcal fat) or high fat (HF, 60% kcal fat) and further into ad libitum water control (W) or low-dose aspartame (A, 5–7 mg/kg/d in drinking water) treatments for 8 week (n = 10–12 animals/treatment). Animals on aspartame consumed fewer calories, gained less weight and had a more favorable body composition when challenged with HF compared to animals consuming water. Despite this, aspartame elevated fasting glucose levels and an insulin tolerance test showed aspartame to impair insulin-stimulated glucose disposal in both CH and HF, independently of body composition. Fecal analysis of gut bacterial composition showed aspartame to increase total bacteria, the abundance of Enterobacteriaceae and Clostridium leptum. An interaction between HF and aspartame was also observed for Roseburia ssp wherein HF-A was higher than HF-W (P<0.05). Within HF, aspartame attenuated the typical HF-induced increase in the Firmicutes:Bacteroidetes ratio. Serum metabolomics analysis revealed aspartame to be rapidly metabolized and to be associated with elevations in the short chain fatty acid propionate, a bacterial end product and highly gluconeogenic substrate, potentially explaining its negative affects on insulin tolerance. How aspartame influences gut microbial composition and the implications of these changes on the development of metabolic disease require further investigation."

Here, we exploit the distinct spatial and temporal localizations of these cells to selectively ablate BMP signaling in each compartment and examine its functional role. We find that BMP signaling is required for HFSC quiescence and to promote TAC differentiation along different lineages as the hair cycle progresses. We also combine in vivo genome-wide chromatin immunoprecipitation and deep-sequencing, transcriptional profiling, and loss-of-function genetics to define BMP-regulated genes. We show that some pSMAD1/5 targets, like Gata3, function specifically in TAC lineage-progression. Others, like Id1 and Id3, function in both HFSCs and TACs, but in distinct ways. Our study therefore illustrates the complex differential roles that a key signaling pathway can play in regulation of closely related stem/progenitor cells within the context of their overall niche."
https://openalex.org/W2014145482,"Background To assess the Knowledge, Attitudes and Practice (KAP) amongst the general community regarding type 2 diabetes mellitus (DM) in rural Bangladesh. Methods Data was collected using cluster random sampling from 3104 adults residing in a rural district in Bangladesh. Participants underwent a KAP questionnaire survey regarding assessing diabetes, socio-demographic and medical history. Descriptive, Chi-square and regression analyses were performed. Results Participants were aged between 30 and 89 years (M = 51, SD = 11.8) and 65.5% were female. The prevalence of diabetes was found to be 8.3%. The majority (93%) reported to have heard of diabetes, yet only 4% knew what a glucose tolerance test was. Only 50% reported that they knew physical inactivity was a risk factor. Age, gender, level of education and socio-economic status (SES) were significantly associated with KAP. A lower proportion (41%) of older participants (aged ≥65 years) reported that they knew that dietary modifications assist in diabetes control compared to those aged less than 35 years (69%), p<0.001. Males (β = 0.393, 95% CI = 0.142–0.643), and any level of education compared to no schooling (β = 0.726, 95% CI = 0.596, 0.857) reported significantly more knowledge, after multivariate adjustments for covariates. Participants aged under 35 years, (odds ratio (OR) = 1.73, 95% CI = 1.22–2.43) had significantly higher positive attitudes towards treatments of diabetes compared to those aged ≥65 years. Of the 99 people with known diabetes, more than 50% (n = 52) never had their blood sugar levels checked since diagnosis. Conclusions Knowledge of diabetes and its risk factors is very limited in rural Bangladesh, even in persons diagnosed with type 2 DM. The development of public health programmes to increase knowledge of diabetes and its complications is required to assist people living in rural Bangladesh to control and management of diabetes."
https://openalex.org/W2044967451,"Chronic wounds have a large impact on health, affecting ∼6.5 M people and costing ∼$25B/year in the US alone. We previously discovered that a genetically modified mouse model displays impaired healing similar to problematic wounds in humans and that sometimes the wounds become chronic. Here we show how and why these impaired wounds become chronic, describe a way whereby we can drive impaired wounds to chronicity at will and propose that the same processes are involved in chronic wound development in humans. We hypothesize that exacerbated levels of oxidative stress are critical for initiation of chronicity. We show that, very early after injury, wounds with impaired healing contain elevated levels of reactive oxygen and nitrogen species and, much like in humans, these levels increase with age. Moreover, the activity of anti-oxidant enzymes is not elevated, leading to buildup of oxidative stress in the wound environment. To induce chronicity, we exacerbated the redox imbalance by further inhibiting the antioxidant enzymes and by infecting the wounds with biofilm-forming bacteria isolated from the chronic wounds that developed naturally in these mice. These wounds do not re-epithelialize, the granulation tissue lacks vascularization and interstitial collagen fibers, they contain an antibiotic-resistant mixed bioflora with biofilm-forming capacity, and they stay open for several weeks. These findings are highly significant because they show for the first time that chronic wounds can be generated in an animal model effectively and consistently. The availability of such a model will significantly propel the field forward because it can be used to develop strategies to regain redox balance that may result in inhibition of biofilm formation and result in restoration of healthy wound tissue. Furthermore, the model can lead to the understanding of other fundamental mechanisms of chronic wound development that can potentially lead to novel therapies."

In this study, we investigated a novel non-peptide, cell-permeable small molecule, named LY5, to target STAT3 in medulloblastoma cells. LY5 inhibited persistent STAT3 phosphorylation and induced apoptosis in human medulloblastoma cell lines expressing constitutive STAT3 phosphorylation.

Here, we report that Pol II is engaged at pluripotency promoters in reprogramming but remains paused and inefficiently released. We also show that bromodomain-containing protein 4 (BRD4) stimulates productive transcriptional elongation of pluripotency genes by dissociating the pause release factor P-TEFb from an inactive complex containing HEXIM1. Consequently, BRD4 overexpression enhances reprogramming efficiency and HEXIM1 suppresses it, whereas Brd4 and Hexim1 knockdown do the opposite.

The enforced expression of defined transcription factors can change cell fate (Sindhu et al., 2012Sindhu C. Samavarchi-Tehrani P. Meissner A. Transcription factor-mediated epigenetic reprogramming.J. Biol. Chem. 2012; 287: 30922-30931Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). A striking example of this phenomenon is the reprogramming of induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) from somatic cells by the Yamanaka factors (OCT4, SOX2, KLF4, and c-MYC; OSKM) (Takahashi and Yamanaka, 2006Takahashi K. Yamanaka S. Induction of pluripotent stem cells from mouse embryonic and adult fibroblast cultures by defined factors.Cell. 2006; 126: 663-676Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (18864) Google Scholar). Because of their ability to differentiate into diverse cell lineages, iPSCs provide a potential supply of cells for regenerative medicine and also an excellent platform for in vitro disease modeling and toxicology screening (Saha and Jaenisch, 2009Saha K. Jaenisch R. Technical challenges in using human induced pluripotent stem cells to model disease.Cell Stem Cell. 2009; 5: 584-595Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (316) Google Scholar). Reprogramming is characterized by the existence of roadblocks that tend to derail the process (Apostolou and Hochedlinger, 2013Apostolou E. Hochedlinger K. Chromatin dynamics during cellular reprogramming.Nature. 2013; 502: 462-471Crossref PubMed Scopus (284) Google Scholar). Gene expression analyses of bulk populations have helped clarify these roadblocks and contributed to dividing reprogramming into distinct phases, e.g., initiation, maturation, and stabilization (Samavarchi-Tehrani et al., 2010Samavarchi-Tehrani P. Golipour A. David L. Sung H.K. Beyer T.A. Datti A. Woltjen K. Nagy A. Wrana J.L. Functional genomics reveals a BMP-driven mesenchymal-to-epithelial transition in the initiation of somatic cell reprogramming.Cell Stem Cell. 2010; 7: 64-77Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (792) Google Scholar). The notion that gene transcription in reprogramming is phased has also been validated using single-cell profiling at different time points (Buganim et al., 2012Buganim Y. Faddah D.A. Cheng A.W. Itskovich E. Markoulaki S. Ganz K. Klemm S.L. van Oudenaarden A. Jaenisch R. Single-cell expression analyses during cellular reprogramming reveal an early stochastic and a late hierarchic phase.Cell. 2012; 150: 1209-1222Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (624) Google Scholar) and with expression arrays of defined intermediate cell populations (Polo et al., 2012Polo J.M. Anderssen E. Walsh R.M. Schwarz B.A. Nefzger C.M. Lim S.M. Borkent M. Apostolou E. Alaei S. Cloutier J. et al.A molecular roadmap of reprogramming somatic cells into iPS cells.Cell. 2012; 151: 1617-1632Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (622) Google Scholar). Elucidating the rate-limiting steps regulating the different phases of gene transcription in reprogramming is important because this may help improve the methodology. Gene transcription in metazoans is highly regulated and comprises multiple steps (Min et al., 2011Min I.M. Waterfall J.J. Core L.J. Munroe R.J. Schimenti J. Lis J.T. Regulating RNA polymerase pausing and transcription elongation in embryonic stem cells.Genes Dev. 2011; 25: 742-754Crossref PubMed Scopus (244) Google Scholar). Formation of the preinitiation complex involves the recruitment of several general transcription factors in addition to Pol II and has traditionally been considered the major rate-limiting step of gene transcription. Consistent with this idea, overexpressing specific subunits of the general transcription factor TFIID potentiates reprogramming by facilitating pluripotency gene transcription (Pijnappel et al., 2013Pijnappel W.W. Esch D. Baltissen M.P. Wu G. Mischerikow N. Bergsma A.J. van der Wal E. Han D.W. Bruch Hv. Moritz S. et al.A central role for TFIID in the pluripotent transcription circuitry.Nature. 2013; 495: 516-519Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). Pausing of activated Pol II ∼30–50 nucleotides downstream of +1 and its release by the P-TEFb complex constitutes another rate-limiting step of gene transcription that has received growing attention in recent years (Levine, 2011Levine M. Paused RNA polymerase II as a developmental checkpoint.Cell. 2011; 145: 502-511Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (208) Google Scholar). Although Pol II pause release was originally thought to represent a rather specialized mechanism of transcriptional regulation, analysis of nascent RNAs using global run-on sequencing (GRO-sequencing) (Min et al., 2011Min I.M. Waterfall J.J. Core L.J. Munroe R.J. Schimenti J. Lis J.T. Regulating RNA polymerase pausing and transcription elongation in embryonic stem cells.Genes Dev. 2011; 25: 742-754Crossref PubMed Scopus (244) Google Scholar) has shown that around one-third of genes in the metazoan genome experience this mode of regulation at some point during the organism’s lifetime (Levine, 2011Levine M. Paused RNA polymerase II as a developmental checkpoint.Cell. 2011; 145: 502-511Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (208) Google Scholar). In this regard, genes regulated through pause release are particularly prevalent in stress responses and during embryonic development (Smith and Shilatifard, 2013Smith E. Shilatifard A. Transcriptional elongation checkpoint control in development and disease.Genes Dev. 2013; 27: 1079-1088Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). Potentially, this is because Pol II pausing and its subsequent release enables a method of rapid and synchronous activation of gene expression programs. Pol II pausing might also be a mechanism to hold the activation of specialized gene programs during cell fate conversions if not stimulated properly through pause release. Here, we demonstrate that the transition of Pol II from a paused to a productive elongation stage is a rate-limiting step for inducing pluripotency genes in the late phase of reprogramming. This transition is promoted by the recruitment of active P-TEFb to pluripotency gene promoters, which is simultaneously coordinated by BRD4 and KLF4. Our study thus proposes a revised model for the reactivation of the pluripotency network in reprogramming. It has been reported that reprogramming comprises two major waves of gene transcription (Polo et al., 2012Polo J.M. Anderssen E. Walsh R.M. Schwarz B.A. Nefzger C.M. Lim S.M. Borkent M. Apostolou E. Alaei S. Cloutier J. et al.A molecular roadmap of reprogramming somatic cells into iPS cells.Cell. 2012; 151: 1617-1632Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (622) Google Scholar). The first wave involves the upregulation of genes related to proliferation, metabolism, and cytoskeletal organization, while the second wave is mostly genes related to the pluripotency network. Because mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs) are very different from pluripotent cells, we envisaged that variations in the mode of transcriptional regulation occur during reprogramming. To test this, we initially contrasted the genes upregulated in the two waves of reprogramming with a previous GRO-sequencing data set of MEFs and embryonic stem cells (ESCs) (Min et al., 2011Min I.M. Waterfall J.J. Core L.J. Munroe R.J. Schimenti J. Lis J.T. Regulating RNA polymerase pausing and transcription elongation in embryonic stem cells.Genes Dev. 2011; 25: 742-754Crossref PubMed Scopus (244) Google Scholar). This study divided genes into four classes: (1) not paused and transcribed, which show concentration of GRO-sequencing reads along the gene body (class I, Figure 1A); (2) paused and transcribed, which show concentration of GRO-sequencing reads in the proximal promoter and less pronouncedly along the gene body (class II, Figure 1A); (3) paused and not transcribed; and (4) not paused and not transcribed. Roughly ∼35%–40% of all RefSeq genes were shown to belong to class II in both MEFs and ESCs, but the kind of genes varied in each cell type. Our comparative analysis showed that genes upregulated in the first wave of reprogramming mostly belong to class II in both ESCs and MEFs (606 genes out of 816) (Figure 1B and Figure S1A available online). Conversely, the second wave is substantially depleted of class II genes in both MEFs and ESCs and is enriched in class II genes in ESCs only (Figure 1B and Figure S1A). Average density of nascent RNA along the promoter and gene body regions of all class II genes induced in the second wave of reprogramming confirmed higher levels of Pol II pausing and pause release in ESCs than in MEFs (Figure S1B). We conclude that many genes activated in the second wave of reprogramming must experience a change in their mode of transcriptional regulation compared to MEFs. This change consists in the pausing of Pol II at their proximal promoters and the subsequent pause release to enter productive elongation. We then hypothesized that productive transcriptional elongation of pluripotency genes could represent a rate-limiting step of reprogramming. To explore this, we performed ChIP-sequencing for Pol II in MEFs reprogrammed with OSKM at days 5 and 8; ESCs and untransduced MEFs were used as controls. The Pol II traveling ratio (TR), which compares the average density of Pol II in the proximal promoter and gene body (Figure 1C), was employed to calculate the degree of pausing among different genes. Consistent with previous reports, we used a TR > 4 as indicative of Pol II pausing (Zeitlinger et al., 2007Zeitlinger J. Stark A. Kellis M. Hong J.-W. Nechaev S. Adelman K. Levine M. Young R.A. RNA polymerase stalling at developmental control genes in the Drosophila melanogaster embryo.Nat. Genet. 2007; 39: 1512-1516Crossref PubMed Scopus (575) Google Scholar). Notably, approximately half of the genes upregulated in the second wave of reprogramming displayed a TR > 4 in OSKM reprogramming at day 8 (Figure 1D), but the same genes showed a significantly lower value at day 5 and in untransduced MEFs (Figures 1E and 1F). There was good correlation between second wave genes paused at day 8 of reprogramming and those classified as class II in ESCs in the GRO-sequencing data analysis (Figure S1C). In addition, comparison with our Pol II ChIP-sequencing data in ESCs showed that a large fraction (55%) of second wave genes has lower TR in ESCs than at day 8 of reprogramming, indicating that they experience productive elongation in ESCs (Figures 1G–1I). Among those genes there are key pluripotency regulators including Oct4 and Nanog (Figure 1G). Interestingly, Oct4 showed substantial pausing at day 5 as well, indicating that for some pluripotency regulators Pol II is recruited early to their promoters but remains paused until the late phase (Figure 1J). Notably, the noncoding pluripotency regulator Mir290 also exhibited Pol II pausing at day 8 of reprogramming (Figure S1D). The Pol II binding pattern of a class II gene in MEFs, Thy1, which is downregulated early in reprogramming, is shown as a control (Figure 1K). Therefore, Pol II pausing at pluripotency promoters characterizes reprogramming, strongly suggesting that productive transcriptional elongation is limiting for this process. To demonstrate that transcriptional pause release of pluripotency genes is limiting for reprogramming, we focused on CDK9, the catalytic subunit of the P-TEFb complex, because it stimulates elongation by phosphorylating Pol II and the negative elongation factors DSIF and NELF (Zhou and Yik, 2006Zhou Q. Yik J.H. The Yin and Yang of P-TEFb regulation: implications for human immunodeficiency virus gene expression and global control of cell growth and differentiation.Microbiol. Mol. Biol. Rev. 2006; 70: 646-659Crossref PubMed Scopus (209) Google Scholar). We observed increased CDK9 expression (assessed by western blotting and quantitative PCR [qPCR]) in ESCs compared to that in MEFs, and we also observed such during the reprogramming of MEFs with OSKM factors delivered as retroviruses (Figure 2A and Figures S2A and S2B). To reduce CDK9 activity, we prepared a retrovirus producing a dominant-negative form (a kinase inactive mutant) of CDK9 (CDK9-DN) and two independent retroviral shRNA vectors (Figure S2C), which were transduced along with OSKM into MEFs bearing an Oct4-GFP transgenic reporter. Reducing CDK9 activity (tested using CDK9-DN) did not alter exogenous OSKM expression level and only impaired cell proliferation moderately (Figures S2D and S2E). Notably, OSKM reprogramming with CDK9-DN or the two shRNAs allowed the formation of AP+ colonies (an early marker of reprogramming) (Buganim et al., 2013Buganim Y. Faddah D.A. Jaenisch R. Mechanisms and models of somatic cell reprogramming.Nat. Rev. Genet. 2013; 14: 427-439Crossref PubMed Scopus (326) Google Scholar), but these were mostly GFP− compared to the controls (Figures 2B–2E), indicating incomplete reprogramming. We achieved the same result using a different reprogramming system, Oct4-GFP transgenic MEFs with an integrated OSKM cassette in the Col1a1 locus, hereafter termed secondary MEFs (Figures S2F and S2G). We also overexpressed CDK9 during OSKM reprogramming but observed no change in the number of GFP+ colonies (Figure S2H). To confirm the selective role of CDK9 in the late phase of reprogramming, we employed a doxycycline-inducible lentivirus producing CDK9-DN (Figure S2I) and a known CDK9 inhibitor (flavopiridol) (Rahl et al., 2010Rahl P.B. Lin C.Y. Seila A.C. Flynn R.A. McCuine S. Burge C.B. Sharp P.A. Young R.A. c-Myc regulates transcriptional pause release.Cell. 2010; 141: 432-445Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (927) Google Scholar). Both approaches impaired the appearance of GFP+ colonies if induced/administered in the late phase (day 7 to day 11) of reprogramming, but not in the early phase (day 0 to day 5) (Figures 2F and 2G and Figures S2J and S2K). We also performed RNA-sequencing of MEFs reprogrammed with OSKM in the presence or absence of CDK9-DN. Interestingly, CDK9-DN induced rather modest changes in gene transcription in the early phase of reprogramming compared to the control (Figures 2H and 2I). Of note, the well-known CDK9 target Hexim1 was among the downregulated genes (He et al., 2006He N. Pezda A.C. Zhou Q. Modulation of a P-TEFb functional equilibrium for the global control of cell growth and differentiation.Mol. Cell. Biol. 2006; 26: 7068-7076Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar) (Table S1). Conversely, CDK9-DN led to the downregulation of a large number of genes at day 10, many of which belong to the second transcriptional wave of reprogramming (Figures 2H–2J and Table S1). The selective effect of ablating CDK9 function on the late phase of reprogramming was validated by qPCR of mesenchymal and epithelial genes in MEFs reprogrammed with OSKM and CDK9-DN at day 5 (Figure S2L) and by qPCR of pluripotency genes at day 9 (Figure 2K). Overall our data support the idea that high levels of P-TEFb activity are dispensable in the early phase of reprogramming but instrumental for reactivating the pluripotency network in the late phase. The experiments above showing that CDK9 overexpression does not enhance the formation of GFP+ colonies led us to speculate that CDK9 enzymatic activity, but not its overall expression level, is a limiting factor for reprogramming. Supporting this possibility, a big proportion of CDK9 is held inactive in a complex containing HEXIM1 in many cell types (Zhou and Yik, 2006Zhou Q. Yik J.H. The Yin and Yang of P-TEFb regulation: implications for human immunodeficiency virus gene expression and global control of cell growth and differentiation.Microbiol. Mol. Biol. Rev. 2006; 70: 646-659Crossref PubMed Scopus (209) Google Scholar). It is also well known that the bromodomain and extraterminal (BET) family member BRD4 activates CDK9 by displacing HEXIM1. BRD4 thus appeared as a candidate for further exploration. There are two different splice isoforms of BRD4 (short and long). They share the amino terminal domain (two tandem bromodomains [BDs]), responsible for interacting with acetylated histones, and the extraterminal (ET) domain (Belkina and Denis, 2012Belkina A.C. Denis G.V. BET domain co-regulators in obesity, inflammation and cancer.Nat. Rev. Cancer. 2012; 12: 465-477Crossref PubMed Scopus (512) Google Scholar). However, only the carboxy terminal domain (CTD) of the long isoform allows interaction with CDK9 and its activation. The short isoform of BRD4 displayed low expression level by qPCR (based on the qPCR cycle threshold [Ct] value) in MEFs and ESCs (Figure S3A), so we did not study it further. Notably, qPCR and western blot of the long isoform of BRD4 (hereafter named BRD4) showed higher expression in ESCs compared to MEFs and an increase of such during OSKM reprogramming (Figure 3A and Figures S3A and S3B). We then reduced BRD4 levels in OSKM reprogramming with two independent retroviral shRNA vectors (Figure S3C). The two shRNAs enabled the formation of AP+ colonies but greatly diminished the appearance of GFP+ colonies (Figures 3B and 3C), matching the pattern previously observed for CDK9 inhibition. Moreover, we could not detect any obvious change in cell proliferation (Figure S3D). The negative effect on reprogramming efficiency of Brd4 knockdown was confirmed using secondary MEFs (Figure S3E). In addition, we observed that the BRD4 inhibitor JQ1 (Belkina and Denis, 2012Belkina A.C. Denis G.V. BET domain co-regulators in obesity, inflammation and cancer.Nat. Rev. Cancer. 2012; 12: 465-477Crossref PubMed Scopus (512) Google Scholar) did not affect reprogramming efficiency when administered in the early phase, but significantly reduced reprogramming efficiency in the late phase (Figures 3D and 3E). Next, we reprogrammed MEFs with OSKM and a retroviral vector producing BRD4. This increased the number of GFP+ colonies (∼3-fold) without noticeably changing the appearance of AP+ colonies (Figures 3F and 3G). Exogenous BRD4 also accelerated the formation of GFP+ colonies compared to the control (Figure 3H) but did not affect cell proliferation (Figure S3F). The enhancing effect on reprogramming of BRD4 overexpression was confirmed using secondary MEFs (Figure S3G). Moreover, iPSC colonies generated with BRD4 and OSKM contained the Brd4 retrovirus in their genome and were fully pluripotent (Figure 3I and Figures S3H–S3K). These data indicate that BRD4 is a positive regulator of the late phase of reprogramming. Because BRD4 has CDK9-independent functions (Belkina and Denis, 2012Belkina A.C. Denis G.V. BET domain co-regulators in obesity, inflammation and cancer.Nat. Rev. Cancer. 2012; 12: 465-477Crossref PubMed Scopus (512) Google Scholar), we tested whether it regulates reprogramming specifically through the activation of CDK9. We prepared retroviral vectors producing a series of truncations that correspond to the major functional domains of BRD4 (Figure 4A). Only those BRD4 constructs retaining the CTD, including BRD4-CTD, were able to pull down endogenous CDK9 when overexpressed in HEK293T cells (Figure 4B). We overexpressed these different truncations together with OSKM in MEFs. Interestingly, BRD4-BD acted as a dominant-negative for endogenous BRD4, reducing GFP+ colonies (Figure 4C) but without obviously changing the number of AP+ colonies (Figure S4A). This effect is likely related to the ability of this construct to diminish the interaction of endogenous BRD4 with chromatin. As predicted, BRD4-Δ-CTD also failed to enhance, and even reduced, the number of GFP+ colonies compared to the control (Figure 4C). In addition, we observed that BRD4-CTD reproducibly enhanced the formation of GFP+ colonies ∼3-fold over intact BRD4 (Figure 4C). This suggested that the ET domain of BRD4 might contain a module that impairs reprogramming, perhaps through interaction with negative regulators. Supporting this idea, a truncated form of BRD4 (BRD4-Δ-ET) that only lacks the ET domain (Figure 4A) increased the number of GFP+ colonies to a level closer to that of BRD4-CTD (Figure 4C). One possible candidate mediating this negative effect is CHD4, which belongs to the MBD3/NuRD complex with repressive function in reprogramming (Rais et al., 2013Rais Y. Zviran A. Geula S. Gafni O. Chomsky E. Viukov S. Mansour A.A. Caspi I. Krupalnik V. Zerbib M. et al.Deterministic direct reprogramming of somatic cells to pluripotency.Nature. 2013; 502: 65-70Crossref PubMed Scopus (411) Google Scholar), because it is known to interact with BRD4 through the ET domain (Rahman et al., 2011Rahman S. Sowa M.E. Ottinger M. Smith J.A. Shi Y. Harper J.W. Howley P.M. The Brd4 extraterminal domain confers transcription activation independent of pTEFb by recruiting multiple proteins, including NSD3.Mol. Cell. Biol. 2011; 31: 2641-2652Crossref PubMed Scopus (364) Google Scholar). We also detected that overexpressing BRD4-ET inhibited rather than enhanced the number of GFP+ colonies (Figure 4C). This implies that overexpressed BRD4-ET might interact as well with positive regulators of reprogramming, thus titrating down their interaction with endogenous BRD4. To further show that the effect of BRD4-CTD is mediated through CDK9, we prepared two mutant forms (CTD-FEE/AAA and CTD-R/P) that cannot interact with CDK9 (Figure 4D). Consistent with previous studies (Bisgrove et al., 2007Bisgrove D.A. Mahmoudi T. Henklein P. Verdin E. Conserved P-TEFb-interacting domain of BRD4 inhibits HIV transcription.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2007; 104: 13690-13695Crossref PubMed Scopus (273) Google Scholar), these mutants could not pull down endogenous CDK9 in immunoprecipitation assays (Figure 4E) and failed to increase the formation of GFP+ colonies over the baseline in MEFs reprogrammed with OSKM (Figure 4F). Introducing the same mutations into full-length BRD4 (BRD4-FEE/AAA and BRD4-R/P) had the same outcome (Figure 4G). We also validated the effect of all BRD4 constructs in secondary MEFs (Figures S4B and S4C). Likewise, we employed a polycistronic OSKM lentiviral vector and BRD4-CTD to reprogram a noninvasive reprogrammable human cell source, urinary cells (Zhou et al., 2012Zhou T. Benda C. Dunzinger S. Huang Y. Ho J.C. Yang J. Wang Y. Zhang Y. Zhuang Q. Li Y. et al.Generation of human induced pluripotent stem cells from urine samples.Nat. Protoc. 2012; 7: 2080-2089Crossref PubMed Scopus (398) Google Scholar). BRD4-CTD significantly increased the number of human ESC-like colonies using cells from three independent donors (Figure 4H). We picked eight independent colonies from one donor; they could be expanded retaining ESC-like morphology (Figure 4I), had integrated the BRD4-CTD transgene, and were fully pluripotent (Figure 4I and Figures S4D–S4F). Collectively, these experiments demonstrate that BRD4 enhances reprogramming (mouse and human) through CDK9. To demonstrate that BRD4 facilitates the activation of the pluripotency network in the late phase of reprogramming, we performed qPCR of MEFs reprogrammed with OSKM and BRD4-CTD at day 9. As expected, BRD4-CTD induced a substantial increase in the expression of pluripotency genes belonging to the second transcriptional wave of reprogramming (Figure 5A), but there was no significant change in epithelial or mesenchymal genes at day 5 (Figure 5B). Next, we studied whether the effect of BRD4 on pluripotency genes is due to stimulation of transcriptional elongation. For this purpose, we selected eight candidates induced in the second wave of reprogramming: Nanog, Oct4, Sall4, Sox2, Dppa2, Rex1, Esrrb, and Utf1. ChIP-qPCR along the promoter and coding region of these genes showed that BRD4-CTD increases Pol II binding to the gene body compared to the control, indicating more productive elongation (Figure 5C and Figure S5A). Similar results were observed performing ChIP for Pol II phosphorylated on serine 2 (Ser2P), a posttranslational modification triggered by CDK9 that specifically identifies elongating Pol II (Zhou and Yik, 2006Zhou Q. Yik J.H. The Yin and Yang of P-TEFb regulation: implications for human immunodeficiency virus gene expression and global control of cell growth and differentiation.Microbiol. Mol. Biol. Rev. 2006; 70: 646-659Crossref PubMed Scopus (209) Google Scholar) (Figure 5C and Figure S5A). If our hypothesis that BRD4 is a major regulator of pluripotency genes during reprogramming were true, one might also expect that reducing BRD4 expression should blunt pluripotency genes in ESCs. However, a previous genome-wide siRNA screening in ESCs showed cell death but not differentiation upon Brd4 knockdown (Fazzio et al., 2008Fazzio T.G. Huff J.T. Panning B. An RNAi screen of chromatin proteins identifies Tip60-p400 as a regulator of embryonic stem cell identity.Cell. 2008; 134: 162-174Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (342) Google Scholar). To clarify this issue, we reduced Brd4 expression in ESCs with two independent lentiviral shRNA vectors (Figure S5B). This caused quick (within 4 days) acquisition of a differentiated morphology and concomitant loss of AP staining and OCT4-GFP signal, which was associated with reduced expression of pluripotency genes and enhanced expression of lineage-specific genes (Figures 5D and 5E and Figure S5C). In addition, we overexpressed BRD4-CTD in ESCs before letting them differentiate by withdrawing LIF. BRD4-CTD had a moderate effect in both sustaining pluripotency genes and preventing the increase of lineage-specific genes, but it could not prevent the quick (within 4 days) loss of ESC morphology and AP staining (Figures S5D and S5E). Finally, to further demonstrate that BRD4 regulates pluripotency genes, we analyzed a BRD4 ChIP-sequencing data set from ESCs. This showed strong binding of BRD4 at the promoter regions of multiple pluripotency genes including Nanog and Oct4 (Figure 5F). Hence, BRD4 regulates pluripotency gene expression in reprogramming and in ESCs. Differences between our work and the study by Fazzio et al., 2008Fazzio T.G. Huff J.T. Panning B. An RNAi screen of chromatin proteins identifies Tip60-p400 as a regulator of embryonic stem cell identity.Cell. 2008; 134: 162-174Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (342) Google Scholar may rely on the extent of Brd4 knockdown, which is likely stronger with the siRNA, and may point to an additional function of BRD4 in regulating the ESC cell cycle. Because the reprogramming booster BRD4 enhances P-TEFb activity by displacing HEXIM1 bound to CDK9 (Zhou and Yik, 2006Zhou Q. Yik J.H. The Yin and Yang of P-TEFb regulation: implications for human immunodeficiency virus gene expression and global control of cell growth and differentiation.Microbiol. Mol. Biol. Rev. 2006; 70: 646-659Crossref PubMed Scopus (209) Google Scholar), we postulated that HEXIM1 is a roadblock to reprogramming. To evaluate this, we reprogrammed MEFs with OSKM and a retroviral vector producing HEXIM1. As expected, this reduced the interaction between endogenous BRD4 and CDK9, as assessed by immunoprecipitation of CDK9 at day 9 of reprogramming (Figure 6A). HEXIM1 overexpression also reduced cell proliferation (Figure S6A), in agreement with previous work in other contexts (Hong et al., 2012Hong P. Chen K. Huang B. Liu M. Cui M. Rozenberg I. Chaqour B. Pan X. Barton E.R. Jiang X.C. Siddiqui M.A. HEXIM1 controls satellite cell expansion after injury to regulate skeletal muscle regeneration.J. Clin. Invest. 2012; 122: 3873-3887Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar). Nevertheless, a significant number of AP+ colonies still formed, though these were mostly GFP− (Figures 6B and 6C). A similar effect was observed with HEXIM1 overexpression in secondary MEFs (F"
https://openalex.org/W1989948394,"Snake venom metalloproteinases (SVMPs) are major components in most viperid venoms that induce disturbances in the hemostatic system and tissues of animals envenomated by snakes. These disturbances are involved in human pathology of snake bites and appear to be essential for the capture and digestion of snake's prey and avoidance of predators. SVMPs are a versatile family of venom toxins acting on different hemostatic targets which are present in venoms in distinct structural forms. However, the reason why a large number of different SVMPs are expressed in some venoms is still unclear. In this study, we evaluated the interference of five isolated SVMPs in blood coagulation of humans, birds and small rodents. P-III class SVMPs (fractions Ic, IIb and IIc) possess gelatinolytic and hemorrhagic activities, and, of these, two also show fibrinolytic activity. P-I class SVMPs (fractions IVa and IVb) are only fibrinolytic. P-III class SVMPs reduced clotting time of human plasma. Fraction IIc was characterized as prothrombin activator and fraction Ic as factor X activator. In the absence of Ca2+, a firm clot was observed in chicken blood samples with fractions Ic, IIb and partially with fraction IIc. In contrast, without Ca2+, only fraction IIc was able to induce a firm clot in rat blood. In conclusion, functionally distinct forms of SVMPs were found in B. neuwiedi venom that affect distinct mechanisms in the coagulation system of humans, birds and small rodents. Distinct SVMPs appear to be more specialized to rat or chicken blood, strengthening the current hypothesis that toxin diversity enhances the possibilities of the snakes for hunting different prey or evading different predators. This functional diversity also impacts the complexity of human envenoming since different hemostatic mechanisms will be targeted by SVMPs accounting for the complexity of the response of humans to venoms."
https://openalex.org/W1987793270,"With the aim of forming bioactive guides for peripheral nerve regeneration, silk fibroin was electrospun to obtain aligned nanofibers. These fibers were functionalized by incorporating Nerve Growth Factor (NGF) and Ciliary NeuroTrophic Factor (CNTF) during electrospinning. PC12 cells grown on the fibers confirmed the bioavailability and bioactivity of the NGF, which was not significantly released from the fibers. Primary neurons from rat dorsal root ganglia (DRGs) were grown on the nanofibers and anchored to the fibers and grew in a directional fashion based on the fiber orientation, and as confirmed by growth cone morphology. These biofunctionalized nanofibers led to a 3-fold increase in neurite length at their contact, which was likely due to the NGF. Glial cell growth, alignment and migration were stimulated by the CNTF in the functionalized nanofibers. Organotypic culture of rat fetal DRGs confirmed the complementary effect of both growth factors in multifunctionalized nanofibers, which allowed glial cell migration, alignment and parallel axonal growth in structures resembling the 'bands of Bungner' found in situ. Graftable multi-channel conduits based on biofunctionalized aligned silk nanofibers were developed as an organized 3D scaffold. Our bioactive silk tubes thus represent new options for a biological and biocompatible nerve guidance conduit."

Functionally, all EF-hand proteins are divided into two groups: (1) calcium sensors, which function to translate the signal to various responses; and (2) calcium buffers, which control the level of free Ca2+ ions in the cytoplasm. The borderline between the two groups is not clear, and many proteins cannot be described as definitive buffers or sensors. Here, we describe two highly-conserved structural motifs found in all known different families of the EF-hand proteins. The two motifs provide a supporting scaffold for the DxDxDG calcium binding loop and contribute to the hydrophobic core of the EF hand domain. The motifs allow more precise identification of calcium buffers and calcium sensors. Based on the characteristics of the two motifs, we could classify individual EF-hand domains into five groups: (1) Open static; (2) Closed static; (3) Local dynamic; (4) Dynamic; and (5) Local static EF-hand domains."

The main parameters analyzed included the numbers of invited and actual participants, and the time and cost to complete the survey. Statistical analysis was descriptive, except for the Kruskal-Wallis-H-test, which was used to compare the three recruitment methods. Cost efficiencies were compared and extrapolated to different-sized cohorts.The ratios of completely answered questionnaires to distributed questionnaires were between 81.5% (E1) and 97.4% (P2). Between 6.4% (P1) and 57.0% (P2) of the invited participants completely answered the questionnaires. The costs per completely answered questionnaire were $0.57-$1.41 (E1-3), $1.70 and $0.80 for H1 and H2, respectively, and $3.36-$4.21 (P1-3). Based on our results, electronic surveys with 10, 20, 30, or 42 questions would be estimated to be most cost (and time) efficient if more than 101.6-225.9 (128.2-391.7), 139.8-229.2 (93.8-193.6), 165.8-230.6 (68.7-115.7), or 188.2-231.5 (44.4-72.7) participants were required, respectively.The study efficiency depended on the technical modalities of the survey methods and engagement of the participants. Depending on our study design, our results suggest that in similar projects that will certainly have more than two to three hundred required participants, the most efficient way of conducting a questionnaire-based survey is likely via the Internet with a digital questionnaire, specifically via a centralized e-mail."

Outcome was overweight according to the International Obesity Task Force gender and age specific body mass index. Smoking exposure was categorized into four groups: no exposure (n = 25,076); exposure only during pregnancy (n = 3,343); exposure only postnatally (n = 140); and exposure during pregnancy and postnatally (n = 4,188). Risk of overweight according to smoking status as well as dose-response relationships were estimated by crude and adjusted odds ratios using logistic regression models.Exposure to smoking only during pregnancy, or both during pregnancy and postnatally were both significantly associated with overweight at 7 years of age (OR: 1.31, 95% CI: 1.15-1.48, and OR: 1.76, 95% CI: 1.58-1.97, respectively). Analyses excluding children with low birth weight (<2,500 gram) revealed similar results. A significant prenatal dose-response relationship was found. Per one additional cigarette smoked per day an increase in risk of overweight was observed (OR: 1.02, 95% CI: 1.01-1.03). When adjusting for quantity of smoking during pregnancy, prolonged exposure after birth further increased the risk of later overweight in the children (OR 1.28, 95% CI:1.09-1.50) compared with exposure only in the prenatal period.Mother's perinatal smoking increased child's OR of overweight at age 7 years irrespective of birth weight, and with higher OR if exposed both during pregnancy and in early postnatal life. Clear dose-response relationships were observed, which emphasizes the need for prevention of any tobacco exposure of infants."

In this study, analysis of the genomic impact caused by domestication and artificial selection was conducted by investigating the signatures of selection using single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in channel catfish (Ictalurus punctatus). A total of 8.4 million candidate SNPs were identified by using next generation sequencing. On average, the channel catfish genome harbors one SNP per 116 bp. Approximately 6.6 million, 5.3 million, 4.9 million, 7.1 million and 6.7 million SNPs were detected in the Marion, Thompson, USDA103, Hatchery strain, and wild population, respectively. The allele frequencies of 407,861 SNPs differed significantly between the domestic and wild populations. With these SNPs, 23 genomic regions with putative selective sweeps were identified that included 11 genes. Although the function for the majority of the genes remain unknown in catfish, several genes with known function related to aquaculture performance traits were included in the regions with selective sweeps. These included hypoxia-inducible factor 1β. HIFιβ.. and the transporter gene ATP-binding cassette sub-family B member 5 (ABCB5). HIF1β. is important for response to hypoxia and tolerance to low oxygen levels is a critical aquaculture trait. The large numbers of SNPs identified from this study are valuable for the development of high-density SNP arrays for genetic and genomic studies of performance traits in catfish."

Very few epidemiologic studies have been done to demonstrate the relationship between familial inbreeding and modest cognitive impairments in children.We aimed to estimate the effect of inbreeding on children's cognitive behavior in comparison with non-inbred children.A cohort of 408 children (6 to 15 years of age) was selected from inbred and non-inbred families of five Muslim populations of Jammu region. The Wechsler Intelligence Scales for Children (WISC) was used to measure the verbal IQ (VIQ), performance IQ (PIQ) and full scale IQ (FSIQ). Family pedigrees were drawn to access the family history and children's inbred status in terms of coefficient of inbreeding (F).We found significant decline in child cognitive abilities due to inbreeding and high frequency of mental retardation among offspring from inbred families. The mean differences (95% C.I.) were reported for the VIQ, being -22.00 (-24.82, -19.17), PIQ -26.92 (-29.96, -23.87) and FSIQ -24.47 (-27.35,-21.59) for inbred as compared to non-inbred children (p<0.001) [corrected].The higher risk of being mentally retarded was found to be more obvious among inbred categories corresponding to the degree of inbreeding and the same accounts least for non-inbred children (p<0.0001). We observed an increase in the difference in mean values for VIQ, PIQ and FSIQ with the increase of inbreeding coefficient and these were found to be statistically significant (p<0.05). The regression analysis showed a fitness decline (depression) for VIQ (R2 = 0.436), PIQ (R2 = 0.468) and FSIQ (R2 = 0.464) with increasing inbreeding coefficients (p<0.01).Our comprehensive assessment provides the evidence for inbreeding depression on cognitive abilities among children."
https://openalex.org/W2101816273,"Ucides cordatus is an abundant mangrove crab in Brazil constructing burrows of up to 2 m depth. Sediment around burrows may oxidize during low tides. This increase in sediment-air contact area may enhance carbon degradation processes. We hypothesized that 1) the sediment CO2 efflux rate is greater with burrows than without and 2) the reduction potential in radial profiles in the sediment surrounding the burrows decreases gradually, until approximating non-bioturbated conditions. Sampling was conducted during the North Brazilian wet season at neap tides. CO2 efflux rates of inhabited burrows and plain sediment were measured with a CO2/H2O gas analyzer connected to a respiration chamber. Sediment redox potential, pH and temperature were measured in the sediment surrounding the burrows at horizontal distances of 2, 5, 8 and 15 cm at four sediment depths (1, 10, 30 and 50 cm) and rH values were calculated. Sediment cores (50 cm length) were taken to measure the same parameters for plain sediment. CO2 efflux rates of plain sediment and individual crab burrows with entrance diameters of 7 cm were 0.7–1.3 µmol m−2 s−1 and 0.2–0.4 µmol burrows−1 s−1, respectively. CO2 released from a Rhizophora mangle dominated forest with an average of 1.7 U. cordatus burrows−1 m−2 yielded 1.0–1.7 µmol m−2 s−1, depending on the month and burrow entrance diameter. Laboratory experiments revealed that 20–60% of the CO2 released by burrows originated from crab respiration. Temporal changes in the reduction potential in the sediment surrounding the burrows did not influence the CO2 release from burrows. More oxidized conditions of plain sediment over time may explain the increase in CO2 release until the end of the wet season. CO2 released by U. cordatus and their burrows may be a significant pathway of CO2 export from mangrove sediments and should be considered in mangrove carbon budget estimates."
https://openalex.org/W2066547896,"Hirschsprung disease (HSCR) is a congenital and heterogeneous disorder characterized by the absence of intramural nervous plexuses along variable lengths of the hindgut. Although RET is a well-established risk factor, a recent genome-wide association study (GWAS) of HSCR has identified NRG1 as an additional susceptibility locus. To discover additional risk loci, we performed a GWAS of 123 sporadic HSCR patients and 432 unaffected controls using a large-scale platform with coverage of over 1 million polymorphic markers. The result was that our study replicated the findings of RET-CSGALNACT2-RASGEF1A genomic region (rawP = 5.69×10−19 before a Bonferroni correction; corrP = 4.31×10−13 after a Bonferroni correction) and NRG1 as susceptibility loci. In addition, this study identified SLC6A20 (adjP = 2.71×10−6), RORA (adjP = 1.26×10−5), and ABCC9 (adjP = 1.86×10−5) as new potential susceptibility loci under adjusting the already known loci on the RET-CSGALNACT2-RASGEF1A and NRG1 regions, although none of the SNPs in these genes passed the Bonferroni correction. In further subgroup analysis, the RET-CSGALNACT2-RASGEF1A genomic region was observed to have different significance levels among subgroups: short-segment (S-HSCR, corrP = 1.71×10−5), long-segment (L-HSCR, corrP = 6.66×10−4), and total colonic aganglionosis (TCA, corrP>0.05).

Therefore, a simple and short test is necessary for primary mass screening in community-based medical facilities. We developed the Cognitive Assessment for Dementia, iPad version (CADi) which consists of 10 simple questions and is self-administered. In this paper we present a revised version which improves the detection of dementia. Two questions of the CADi were replaced in the latest version (CADi2). We examined the validity and reliability of the CADi2 in 27 Alzheimer’s disease patients and age-matched healthy controls. The Alzheimer’s disease patients had lower CADi2 scores and longer total response times to questions compared to the controls. The CADi2 had high sensitivity (0.85−0.96) and specificity (0.81−0.93), and showed significant correlations with existing standard neuropsychological tests. Cronbach’s alpha analysis revealed moderate consistency of the CADi2. These results support the utility of the CADi2 for primary screening for dementia."

Patients underwent coronary angiography and endothelial function testing in the cardiac catheterization laboratory. Patients were divided into abnormal (n = 26) and normal (n = 22) microvascular coronary endothelial function based on intracoronary response to infused acetylcholine measured as a percent change in coronary blood flow (CBF) and arterial diameter. Blood samples were obtained simultaneously from the aorta and coronary sinus at the time of catheterization for RNA isolation, and miR subsequently assessed. Baseline characteristics were similar in both groups. Patients with microvascular CED displayed transcoronary gradients significantly elevated in miR-92a and miR-133 normalized to C-elegans-39 miR. Percent change in CBF and the transcoronary gradient of miR-133 displayed a significant inverse correlation (r2 = 0.11, p = 0.03). Thus, we present novel data whereupon selected miRs demonstrate elevated transcoronary gradients in patients with microvascular CED. The current findings support further studies on the mechanistic role of miRs in coronary atherosclerosis and in humans."
https://openalex.org/W1981836597,"Combining crop plants with other plant species in agro-ecosystems is one way to enhance ecological pest and disease regulation mechanisms. Resource availability and microclimatic variation mechanisms affect processes related to pest and pathogen life cycles. These mechanisms are supported both by empirical research and by epidemiological models, yet their relative importance in a real complex agro-ecosystem is still not known. Our aim was thus to assess the independent effects and the relative importance of different variables related to resource availability and microclimatic variation that explain pest and disease occurrence at the plot scale in real complex agro-ecosystems. The study was conducted in cacao (Theobroma cacao) agroforests in Cameroon, where cocoa production is mainly impacted by the mirid bug, Sahlbergella singularis, and black pod disease, caused by Phytophthora megakarya. Vegetation composition and spatial structure, resource availability and pest and disease occurrence were characterized in 20 real agroforest plots. Hierarchical partitioning was used to identify the causal variables that explain mirid density and black pod prevalence. The results of this study show that cacao agroforests can be differentiated on the basis of vegetation composition and spatial structure. This original approach revealed that mirid density decreased when a minimum number of randomly distributed forest trees were present compared with the aggregated distribution of forest trees, or when forest tree density was low. Moreover, a decrease in mirid density was also related to decreased availability of sensitive tissue, independently of the effect of forest tree structure. Contrary to expectations, black pod prevalence decreased with increasing cacao tree abundance. By revealing the effects of vegetation composition and spatial structure on mirids and black pod, this study opens new perspectives for the joint agro-ecological management of cacao pests and diseases at the plot scale, through the optimization of the spatial structure and composition of the vegetation."

It revealed the distinct community compositions between the two digesters and their progressive shifting over time. Methanogens and syntrophic bacteria were found much less abundant in the agitated digester, which was mainly attributed to the presence of bacterial genera Acetanaerobacterium and Ruminococcus with relatively high abundance. The characterization of the microbial community corroborated the digestion performance affected at the agitated condition, where lower methane yield and delayed methane production rate were observed. This was further verified by the accumulation of propionic acid in the agitated digester."
https://openalex.org/W2021698024,"Erianthus arundinaceus is a valuable source of agronomic traits for sugarcane improvement such as ratoonability, biomass, vigor, tolerance to drought and water logging, as well as resistance to pests and disease. To investigate the introgression of the E. arundinaceus genome into sugarcane, five intergeneric F1 hybrids between S. officinarum and E. arundinaceus and 13 of their BC1 progeny were studied using the genomic in situ hybridization (GISH) technique. In doing so, we assessed the chromosome composition and chromosome transmission in these plants. All F1 hybrids were aneuploidy, containing either 28 or 29 E. arundinaceus chromosomes. The number of E. arundinaceus chromosomes in nine of the BC1 progeny was less than or equal to 29. Unexpectedly, the number of E. arundinaceus chromosomes in the other four BC1 progeny was above 29, which was more than in their F1 female parents. This is the first cytogenetic evidence for an unexpected inheritance pattern of E. arundinaceus chromosomes in sugarcane. We pointed to several mechanisms that may be involved in generating more than 2n gametes in the BC1 progeny. Furthermore, the implication of these results for sugarcane breeding programs was discussed."
https://openalex.org/W2088048604,"The Notch signaling pathway plays versatile roles during heart development. However, there is contradictory evidence that Notch pathway either facilitates or impairs cardiomyogenesis in vitro. In this study, we developed iPSCs by reprogramming of murine fibroblasts with GFP expression governed by Oct4 promoter, and identified an effective strategy to enhance cardiac differentiation through timely modulation of Notch signaling. The Notch inhibitor DAPT (N-[N-(3,5-difluorophenacetyl)-l-alanyl]-S-phenylglycine t-butyl ester) alone drove the iPSCs to a neuronal fate. After mesoderm induction of embryoid bodies initiated by ascorbic acid (AA), the subsequent treatment of DAPT accelerated the generation of spontaneously beating cardiomyocytes. The timed synergy of AA and DAPT yielded an optimal efficiency of cardiac differentiation. Mechanistic studies showed that Notch pathway plays a biphasic role in cardiomyogenesis. It favors the early-stage cardiac differentiation, but exerts negative effects on the late-stage differentiation. Therefore, DAPT administration at the late stage enforced the inhibition of endogenous Notch activity, thereby enhancing cardiomyogenesis. In parallel, DAPT dramatically augmented the expression of Wnt3a, Wnt11, BMP2, and BMP4. In conclusion, our results highlight a practicable approach to generate cardiomyocytes from iPSCs based on the stage-specific biphasic roles of Notch signaling in cardiomyogenesis."
https://openalex.org/W1985220024,"Background and Objectives Acute kidney injury (AKI) complicates the course of disease in critically ill patients. Efforts to change its clinical course have failed because of the fail in the early detection. This study was designed to assess whether heat shock protein (Hsp72) is an early and sensitive biomarker of acute kidney injury (AKI) compared with kidney injury molecule (Kim-1), neutrophil gelatinase-associated lipocalin (NGAL), and interleukin-18 (IL-18) biomarkers. Methods A total of 56 critically ill patients fulfilled the inclusion criteria. From these patients, 17 developed AKI and 20 were selected as controls. In AKI patients, Kim-1, IL-18, NGAL, and Hsp72 were measured from 3 days before and until 2 days after the AKI diagnosis and in no-AKI patients at 1, 5 and 10 days after admission. Biomarker sensitivity and specificity were determined. To validate the results obtained with ROC curves for Hsp72, a new set of critically ill patients was included, 10 with AKI and 12 with no-AKI patients. Results Urinary Hsp72 levels rose since 3 days before the AKI diagnosis in critically ill patients; this early increase was not seen with any other tested biomarkers. Kim-1, IL-18, NGAL, and Hsp72 significantly increased from 2 days before AKI and remained elevated during the AKI diagnosis. The best sensitivity/specificity was observed in Kim-1 and Hsp72: 83/95% and 100/90%, respectively, whereas 1 day before the AKI diagnosis, the values were 100/100% and 100/90%, respectively. The sensibility, specificity and accuracy in the validation test for Hsp72 were 100%, 83.3% and 90.9%, respectively. Conclusions The biomarker Hsp72 is enough sensitive and specific to predict AKI in critically ill patients up to 3 days before the diagnosis."
https://openalex.org/W2012664753,"Functional selectivity is a property of G protein-coupled receptors that allows them to preferentially couple to particular signaling partners upon binding of biased agonists. Publication of the X-ray crystal structure of serotonergic 5-HT1B and 5-HT2B receptors in complex with ergotamine, a drug capable of activating G protein coupling and β-arrestin signaling at the 5-HT1B receptor but clearly favoring β-arrestin over G protein coupling at the 5-HT2B subtype, has recently provided structural insight into this phenomenon. In particular, these structures highlight the importance of specific residues, also called micro-switches, for differential receptor activation. In our work, we apply classical molecular dynamics simulations and enhanced sampling approaches to analyze the behavior of these micro-switches and their impact on the stabilization of particular receptor conformational states. Our analysis shows that differences in the conformational freedom of helix 6 between both receptors could explain their different G protein-coupling capacity. In particular, as compared to the 5-HT1B receptor, helix 6 movement in the 5-HT2B receptor can be constrained by two different mechanisms. On the one hand, an anchoring effect of ergotamine, which shows an increased capacity to interact with the extracellular part of helices 5 and 6 and stabilize them, hinders activation of a hydrophobic connector region at the center of the receptor. On the other hand, this connector region in an inactive conformation is further stabilized by unconserved contacts extending to the intracellular part of the 5-HT2B receptor, which hamper opening of the G protein binding site. This work highlights the importance of considering receptor capacity to adopt different conformational states from a dynamic perspective in order to underpin the structural basis of functional selectivity."
https://openalex.org/W2074995508,"Natural killer (NK) cells are innate immune effector cells that protect against cancer and some viral infections. Until recently, most studies have investigated the molecular signatures of human or mouse NK cells to identify genes that are specifically expressed during NK cell development. However, the mechanism regulating NK cell development remains unclear. Here, we report a regulatory network of potential interactions during in vitro differentiation of human NK cells, identified using genome-wide mRNA and miRNA databases through hierarchical clustering analysis, gene ontology analysis and a miRNA target prediction program. The microRNA (miR)-583, which demonstrated the largest ratio change in mature NK cells, was highly correlated with IL2 receptor gamma (IL2Rγ) expression. The overexpression of miR-583 had an inhibitory effect on NK cell differentiation. In a reporter assay, the suppressive effect of miR-583 was ablated by mutating the putative miR-583 binding site of the IL2Rγ 3′ UTR. Therefore, we show that miR-583 acts as a negative regulator of NK cell differentiation by silencing IL2Rγ. Additionally, we provide a comprehensive database of genome-wide mRNA and miRNA expression during human NK cell differentiation, offering a better understanding of basic human NK cell biology for the application of human NK cells in immunotherapy."
https://openalex.org/W2086037940,"Although helminthic therapy as a possible new option to treat inflammatory bowel disease is a well-established concept by now, the search for immunomodulatory helminth-derived compounds and their mechanisms of action is still ongoing. We investigated the therapeutic potential and the underlying immunological mechanisms of Schistosoma mansoni soluble worm proteins (SmSWP) in an adoptive T cell transfer mouse model of chronic colitis. Both a curative and a preventive treatment protocol were included in this study. The curative administration of SmSWP (started when colitis was established), resulted in a significant improvement of the clinical disease score, colonoscopy, macroscopic and microscopic inflammation score, colon length and myeloperoxidase activity. The therapeutic potential of the preventive SmSWP treatment (started before colitis was established), was less pronounced compared with the curative SmSWP treatment but still resulted in an improved clinical disease score, body weight loss, colon length and microscopic inflammation score. Both the curative and preventive SmSWP treatment downregulated the mRNA expression of the proinflammatory cytokines IFN-γ and IL-17A and upregulated the mRNA expression of the anti-inflammatory cytokine IL-4 in the colon at the end of the experiment. This colonic immunomodulatory effect of SmSWP could not be confirmed at the protein level. Moreover, the effect of SmSWP appeared to be a local colonic phenomenon, since the flow cytometric T cell characterization of the mesenteric lymph nodes and the cytokine measurements in the serum did not reveal any effect of SmSWP treatment. In conclusion, SmSWP treatment reduced the severity of colitis in the adoptive transfer mouse model via the suppression of proinflammatory cytokines and the induction of an anti-inflammatory response in the colon."
https://openalex.org/W1972066496,"Vaccination uptake of pregnant women in Morocco during the A (H1N1) pdm09 pandemic was lower than expected. A qualitative study using open-ended questions was developed to explore the main determinants of acceptance and non-acceptance of the monovalent A (H1N1) pdm09 vaccine among pregnant women in Morocco and to identify information sources that influenced their decision-making process. The study sample included 123 vaccinated and unvaccinated pregnant women who were in their second or third trimester between December 2009 and March 2010. They took part in 14 focus group discussions and eight in-depth interviews in the districts of Casablanca and Kenitra. Thematic qualitative analysis identified reasons for vaccine non-acceptance: (1) fear of the monovalent A (H1N1) pdm09 vaccine, (2) belief in an A (H1N1) pdm09 pandemic conspiracy, (3) belief in the inapplicability of the monovalent A (H1N1) pdm09 vaccine to Moroccans, (4) lack of knowledge of the monovalent A (H1N1) pdm09 vaccine, and (5) challenges of vaccination services/logistics. Reasons for vaccine acceptance included: (1) perceived benefits and (2) modeling. Decision-making was strongly influenced by family, community, mass media, religious leaders and health providers suggesting that broad communication efforts should also be used to advocate for vaccination. Meaningful communication for future vaccine campaigns must consider these context-specific findings. As cultural and religious values are shared across many Arab countries, these findings may also provide valuable insights for seasonal influenza vaccine planning in the Middle East and North Africa region at large."
https://openalex.org/W2057879477,"In a context of reduced global biodiversity, the potential impacts from the loss of habitat-forming species (HFS) on ecosystem structure and functioning must be established. These species are often the main community primary producers and have a major role in the establishment of organisms through facilitation processes. This study focuses on macroalgae and mussels as HFS within an intertidal zone along the St. Lawrence estuary (Quebec, Canada). Over a 16-week period, we manipulated the in situ diversity profile (richness, evenness, identity, and abundance) of the dominant HFS (Fucus distichus edentatus, F. vesiculosus, and Mytilus spp.) in order to define their role in both the establishment of associated species and community primary production. Contrary to expectation, no general change in HFS richness, evenness, abundance, or identity on associated species community establishment was observed. However, over the study period, the HFS diversity profile modified the structure within the trophic guilds, which may potentially affect further community functions. Also, our results showed that the low abundance of HFS had a negative impact on the primary productivity of the community. Our results suggest that HFS diversity profiles have a limited short-term role in our study habitat and may indicate that biological forcing in these intertidal communities is less important than environmental conditions. As such, there was an opportunistic establishment of species that ensured rapid colonization regardless of the absence, or the diversity profile, of facilitators such as HFS."
https://openalex.org/W1993516251,"Transforming growth factor-β (TGF-β) plays a pivotal role in renal fibrosis. Endoglin, a 180 KDa membrane glycoprotein, is a TGF-β co-receptor overexpressed in several models of chronic kidney disease, but its function in renal fibrosis remains uncertain. Two membrane isoforms generated by alternative splicing have been described, L-Endoglin (long) and S-Endoglin (short) that differ from each other in their cytoplasmic tails, being L-Endoglin the most abundant isoform. The aim of this study was to assess the effect of L-Endoglin overexpression in renal tubulo-interstitial fibrosis. For this purpose, a transgenic mouse which ubiquitously overexpresses human L-Endoglin (L-ENG+) was generated and unilateral ureteral obstruction (UUO) was performed in L-ENG+ mice and their wild type (WT) littermates. Obstructed kidneys from L-ENG+ mice showed higher amounts of type I collagen and fibronectin but similar levels of α-smooth muscle actin (α-SMA) than obstructed kidneys from WT mice. Smad1 and Smad3 phosphorylation were significantly higher in obstructed kidneys from L-ENG+ than in WT mice. Our results suggest that the higher increase of renal fibrosis observed in L-ENG+ mice is not due to a major abundance of myofibroblasts, as similar levels of α-SMA were observed in both L-ENG+ and WT mice, but to the higher collagen and fibronectin synthesis by these fibroblasts. Furthermore, in vivo L-Endoglin overexpression potentiates Smad1 and Smad3 pathways and this effect is associated with higher renal fibrosis development."

RcSUS1 transcripts peaked during early development, whereas levels of SUS activity and immunoreactive 93-kDa SUS polypeptides maximized during mid-development, becoming undetectable in fully mature COS.

Incorporation of 32Pi from [γ-32P]ATP into a RcSUS1 peptide substrate, alongside a phosphosite-specific ELISA assay, established the presence of calcium-dependent RcSUS1 (Ser-11) kinase activity. Approximately 10% of RcSUS1 was associated with COS microsomal membranes and was hypophosphorylated relative to the remainder of RcSUS1 that partitioned into the soluble, cytosolic fraction. Elimination of sucrose supply caused by excision of intact pods of developing COS abolished RcSUS1 transcription while triggering the progressive dephosphorylation of RcSUS1 in planta. This did not influence the proportion of RcSUS1 associated with microsomal membranes but instead correlated with a subsequent marked decline in SUS activity and immunoreactive RcSUS1 polypeptides.

https://openalex.org/W1965936515,"Background The roots of adult hypertension go back to childhood. This study aimed to examine the independent effects of physical, behavioural and genetic factors identified in childhood and mid-adulthood for prediction of adult hypertension. Methods The study subjects were participants of the Kaunas Cardiovascular Risk Cohort study started in 1977 (n = 1082, age 12–13 years). In 2012, a total of 507 individuals (63.9% of eligible sample) participated in the 35-year follow-up survey. Health examination involved measurements of blood pressure (BP), anthropometric parameters, and interview about health behaviours. Subjects were genotyped for AGT (M235T), ACE (I/D, rs4340), ADM (rs7129220), and CACNB2 (rs12258967) genes polymorphisms. A genetic risk score was calculated as the sum of the number of risk alleles at each of four single nucleotide polymorphisms. Results AGT TT genotype male carriers had the highest mean values of systolic BP in childhood. In females, ADM genotype AA was associated with the highest values of systolic and diastolic BP, while CACNB2 genotype CC carriers had the highest values of diastolic BP in childhood. Systolic and diastolic BP in childhood, gain in BMI from childhood to adulthood, and risky alcohol consumption predicted hypertension in middle-aged men. In women, genetic risk score together with diastolic BP in childhood and gain in BMI were significant predictors of adult hypertension. The comparison of four nested logistic regression models showed that the prediction of hypertension improved significantly after the addition of BMI gain. Genetic risk score had a relatively weak effect on the improvement of the model performance in women. Conclusions BP in childhood and the gain in BMI from childhood to adulthood were significant predictors of adult hypertension in both genders. Genetic risk score in women and risky alcohol consumption in men were independently related with the risk of adult hypertension."
https://openalex.org/W1977869075,"MicroRNAs (miRNAs) have been shown to be promising biomarkers in predicting cancer prognosis. However, inappropriate or poorly optimized processing and modeling of miRNA expression data can negatively affect prediction performance. Here, we propose a holistic solution for miRNA biomarker selection and prediction model building. This work introduces the use of a neural network cascade, a cascaded constitution of small artificial neural network units, for evaluating miRNA expression and patient outcome. A miRNA microarray dataset of nasopharyngeal carcinoma was retrieved from Gene Expression Omnibus to illustrate the methodology. Results indicated a nonlinear relationship between miRNA expression and patient death risk, implying that direct comparison of expression values is inappropriate. However, this method performs transformation of miRNA expression values into a miRNA score, which linearly measures death risk. Spearman correlation was calculated between miRNA scores and survival status for each miRNA. Finally, a nine-miRNA signature was optimized to predict death risk after nasopharyngeal carcinoma by establishing a neural network cascade consisting of 13 artificial neural network units. Area under the ROC was 0.951 for the internal validation set and had a prediction accuracy of 83% for the external validation set. In particular, the established neural network cascade was found to have strong immunity against noise interference that disturbs miRNA expression values. This study provides an efficient and easy-to-use method that aims to maximize clinical application of miRNAs in prognostic risk assessment of patients with cancer."
https://openalex.org/W2039467562,"Nucleolin (NCL) is a major nucleolar phosphoprotein that has pleiotropic effects on cell proliferation and is elevated in a variety of tumors. NCL is highly phosphorylated at the N-terminus by two major kinases: interphase casein kinase 2 (CK2) and mitotic cyclin-dependent kinase 1 (CDK1). Earlier we demonstrated that a NCL-mutant that is partly defective in undergoing phosphorylation by CK2 inhibits chromosomal replication through its interactions with Replication Protein A, mimicking the cellular response to DNA damage. We further delineated that the N-terminus of NCL associates with Hdm2, the most common E3 ubiquitin ligase of p53. We reported that NCL antagonizes Hdm2 to stabilize p53 and stimulates p53 transcriptional activity. Although NCL-phosphorylation by CK2 and ribosomal DNA transcription are closely coordinated during interphase, the role of NCL phosphorylation in regulating cell proliferation remains unexplored. We have therefore engineered unique human cells that specifically induce expression of NCL-wild type (WT) or a phosphorylation-deficient NCL-mutant, 6/S*A where all the six CK2 consensus serine sites residing in the N-terminus NCL were mutated to alanine. Here we show that this NCL-mutant is defective in undergoing phosphorylation by CK2. We also demonstrate that NCL-phosphorylation by CK2 is required through the S-phase progression in cell cycle and hence proliferation. Induced expression of NCL with mutated CK2 phosphorylation sites stabilizes p53, results in higher expression of Bcl2 (B-cell lymphoma 2) homology 3 (BH3)-only apoptotic markers and causes a dominant-negative effect on cell viability. Our unique cellular system thus provides the first evidential support to delineate phospho-specific functions of NCL on cell proliferation."
https://openalex.org/W2058418938,"Osteosarcoma is the most common primary malignancy of bone. Even after the traditional standard surgical therapy, metastasis still occurs in a high percentage of patients. Glucose is an important source of metabolic energy for tumor proliferation and survival. Tumors usually overexpress glucose transporters, especially hypoxia-responsive glucose transporter 1 and glucose transporter 3. Osteopontin, hypoxia-responsive glucose transporter 1, and glucose transporter 3 are overexpressed in many types of tumors and have been linked to tumorigenesis and metastasis. In this study, we investigated the regulation of glucose transporters by osteopontin in osteosarcoma. We observed that both glucose transporters and osteopontin were upregulated in hypoxic human osteosarcoma cells. Endogenously released osteopontin regulated the expression of glucose transporter 1 and glucose transporter 3 in osteosarcoma and enhanced glucose uptake into cells via the αvβ3 integrin. Knockdown of osteopontin induced cell death in 20% of osteosarcoma cells. Phloretin, a glucose transporter inhibitor, also caused cell death by treatment alone. The phloretin-induced cell death was significantly enhanced in osteopontin knockdown osteosarcoma cells. Combination of a low dose of phloretin and chemotherapeutic drugs, such as daunomycin, 5-Fu, etoposide, and methotrexate, exhibited synergistic cytotoxic effects in three osteosarcoma cell lines. Inhibition of glucose transporters markedly potentiated the apoptotic sensitivity of chemotherapeutic drugs in osteosarcoma. These results indicate that the combination of a low dose of a glucose transporter inhibitor with cytotoxic drugs may be beneficial for treating osteosarcoma patients."
https://openalex.org/W2037565397,"To assess the effects of the orphan nuclear Estrogen receptor-related receptor gamma (ERRγ) deficiency on skeletal development and bone turnover, we utilized an ERRγ global knockout mouse line. While we observed no gross morphological anomalies or difference in skeletal length in newborn mice, by 8 weeks of age ERRγ +/- males but not females exhibited increased trabecular bone, which was further increased by 14 weeks. The increase in trabecular bone was due to an increase in active osteoblasts on the bone surface, without detectable alterations in osteoclast number or activity. Consistent with the histomorphometric results, we observed an increase in gene expression of the bone formation markers alkaline phosphatase (Alp) and bone sialoprotein (Bsp) in bone and increase in serum ALP, but no change in the osteoclast regulators receptor activator of NF-κB ligand (RANKL) and osteoprotegerin (OPG) or the resorption marker carboxy-terminal collagen crosslinks (CTX). More colony forming units-alkaline phosphatase and -osteoblast (CFU-ALP, CFU-O respectively) but not CFU-fibroblast (CFU-F) formed in ERRγ +/- versus ERRγ +/+ stromal cell cultures, suggesting that ERRγ negatively regulates osteoblast differentiation and matrix mineralization but not mesenchymal precursor number. By co-immunoprecipitation experiments, we found that ERRγ and RUNX2 interact in an ERRγ DNA binding domain (DBD)-dependent manner. Treatment of post-confluent differentiating bone marrow stromal cell cultures with Runx2 antisense oligonucleotides resulted in a reduction of CFU-ALP/CFU-O in ERRγ +/- but not ERRγ +/+ mice compared to their corresponding sense controls. Our data indicate that ERRγ is not required for skeletal development but is a sex-dependent negative regulator of postnatal bone formation, acting in a RUNX2- and apparently differentiation stage-dependent manner."

Methods Primary cardiomyocytes which were isolated from neonatal mouse were randomized to be treated with lentivirus carrying Lin28a siRNA, Lin28acDNA 72 h before H/R (9 h/2 h). Cardiomyocytes biomarkers release (LDH and CK), cardiomyocytes apoptosis, mitochondria biogenesis and morphology, intracellular reactive oxygen species (ROS) production, ATP content and inflammatory cytokines levels after H/R injury in high glucose/high fat conditions were compared between groups. The target proteins of Lin28a were examined by western blot analysis. Results Our results revealed that Lin28a cDNA transfection (overexpression) significantly inhibited cardiomyocyte apoptotic index, improved mitochondria biogenesis, increased ATP production and reduced ROS production as compared with the H/R group in HG/HF conditions. Lin28a siRNA transfection (knockdown) rendered the cardiomyocytes more susceptible to H/R injury as evidenced by increased apoptotic index, impaired mitochondrial biogenesis, decreased ATP production and increased ROS level. Interestingly, these effects of Lin28a were blocked by pretreatment with the PI3K inhibitor wortmannin. Lin28a overexpression increased, while Lin28a knockdown inhibited IGF1R, Nrf-1, Tfam, p-IRS-1, p-Akt, p-mTOR, p-p70s6k, p-AMPK expression levels after H/R injury in HG/HF conditions. Moreover, pretreatment with wortmannin abolished the effects of Lin28a on the expression levels of p-AKT, p-mTOR, p-p70s6k, p-AMPK. Conclusions The present results suggest that Lin28a inhibits cardiomyocytes apoptosis by enhancing mitochondrial biogenesis and function under high glucose/high fat conditions. The mechanism responsible for the effects of Lin28a is associated with the PI3K/Akt dependent pathway."
https://openalex.org/W2024013848,"Introduction Nordic countries do not have the smallest health inequalities despite egalitarian social policies. A possible explanation for this is that drivers of class differences in health such as financial strain and labour force status remain socially patterned in Nordic countries. Methods Our analyses used data for working age (25–59) men (n = 48,249) and women (n = 52,654) for 20 countries from five rounds (2002–2010) of the European Social Survey. The outcome was self-rated health in 5 categories. Stratified by gender we used fixed effects linear regression models and marginal standardisation to instigate how countries varied in the degree to which class inequalities were attenuated by financial strain and labour force status. Results and Discussion Before adjustment, Nordic countries had large inequalities in self-rated health relative to other European countries. For example the regression coefficient for the difference in health between working class and professional men living in Norway was 0.34 (95% CI 0.26 to 0.42), while the comparable figure for Spain was 0.15 (95% CI 0.08 to 0.22). Adjusting for financial strain and labour force status led to attenuation of health inequalities in all countries. However, unlike some countries such as Spain, where after adjustment the regression coefficient for working class men was only 0.02 (95% CI −0.05 to 0.10), health inequalities persisted after adjustment for Nordic countries. For Norway the adjusted coefficient was 0.17 (95% CI 0.10 to 0.25). Results for women and men were similar. However, in comparison to men, class inequalities tended to be stronger for women and more persistent after adjustment. Conclusions Adjusting for financial security and labour force status attenuates a high proportion of health inequalities in some counties, particularly Southern European countries, but attenuation in Nordic countries was modest and did not improve their relative position."
https://openalex.org/W2042529891,"Gene expression in trypanosomes is controlled mostly by post-transcriptional pathways. Little is known about the components of mRNA nucleocytoplasmic export routes in these parasites. Comparative genomics has shown that the mRNA transport pathway is the least conserved pathway among eukaryotes. Nonetheless, we identified a RNA helicase (Hel45) that is conserved across eukaryotes and similar to shuttling proteins involved in mRNA export. We used in silico analysis to predict the structure of Trypanosoma cruzi Hel45, including the N-terminal domain and the C-terminal domain, and our findings suggest that this RNA helicase can form complexes with mRNA. Hel45 was present in both nucleus and cytoplasm. Electron microscopy showed that Hel45 is clustered close to the cytoplasmic side of nuclear pore complexes, and is also present in the nucleus where it is associated with peripheral compact chromatin. Deletion of a predicted Nuclear Export Signal motif led to the accumulation of Hel45ΔNES in the nucleus, indicating that Hel45 shuttles between the nucleus and the cytoplasm. This transport was dependent on active transcription but did not depend on the exportin Crm1. Knockdown of Mex67 in T. brucei caused the nuclear accumulation of the T. brucei ortholog of Hel45. Indeed, Hel45 is present in mRNA ribonucleoprotein complexes that are not associated with polysomes. It is still necessary to confirm the precise function of Hel45. However, this RNA helicase is associated with mRNA metabolism and its nucleocytoplasmic shuttling is dependent on an mRNA export route involving Mex67 receptor."
https://openalex.org/W1969782272,"Hyperthermostable proteins are highly resistant to various extreme conditions. Many factors have been proposed to contribute to their ultrahigh structural stability. Some thermostable proteins have larger oligomeric size when compared to their mesophilic homologues. The formation of compact oligomers can minimize the solvent accessible surface area and increase the changes of Gibbs free energy for unfolding. Similar to mesophilic proteins, hyperthermostable proteins also face the problem of unproductive aggregation. In this research, we investigated the role of high-order oligomerization in the fight against aggregation by a hyperthermostable superoxide dismutase identified from Tengchong, China (tcSOD). Besides the predominant tetramers, tcSOD could also form active high-order oligomers containing at least eight subunits. The dynamic equilibrium between tetramers and high-order oligomers was not significantly affected by pH, salt concentration or moderate temperature. The secondary and tertiary structures of tcSOD remained unchanged during heating, while cross-linking experiments showed that there were conformational changes or structural fluctuations at high temperatures. Mutational analysis indicated that the last helix at the C-terminus was involved in the formation of high-order oligomers, probably via domain swapping. Based on these results, we proposed that the reversible conversion between the active tetramers and high-order oligomers might provide a buffering system for tcSOD to fight against the irreversible protein aggregation pathway. The formation of active high-order oligomers not only increases the energy barrier between the native state and unfolded/aggregated state, but also provides the enzyme the ability to reproduce the predominant oligomers from the active high-order oligomers."

Liver IR was the strongest predictor of both incident type 2 diabetes (hazard ratio = 1.83, 95% confidence interval: 1.68–1.98) and cardiovascular events (hazard ratio = 1.31, 95% confidence interval: 1.15–1.48). Hazard ratios for fasting insulin were 1.37 (95% confidence interval: 1.32–1.42) and 1.11 (95% confidence interval: 1.00–1.24), respectively. Tissue-specific markers of IR, Matsuda IR and Adipocyte IR, were superior to fasting plasma insulin level in predicting worsening of hyperglycemia, and Liver IR was superior to fasting insulin level in predicting incident type 2 diabetes and cardiovascular events."
https://openalex.org/W2023378624,"CinA is a widely distributed protein in Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria. It is associated with natural competence and is proposed to have a function as an enzyme participating in the pyridine nucleotide cycle, which recycles products formed by non-redox uses of NAD. Here we report the determination of the crystal structure of CinA from Thermus thermophilus, in complex with several ligands. CinA was shown to have both nicotinamide mononucleotide deamidase and ADP-ribose pyrophosphatase activities. The crystal structure shows an unusual asymmetric dimer, with three domains for each chain; the C-terminal domain harbors the nicotinamide mononucleotide deamidase activity, and the structure of a complex with the product nicotinate mononucleotide suggests a mechanism for deamidation. The N-terminal domain belongs to the COG1058 family and is associated with the ADP-ribose pyrophosphatase activity. The asymmetry in the CinA dimer arises from two alternative orientations of the COG1058 domains, only one of which forms a contact with the KH-type domain from the other chain, effectively closing the active site into, we propose, a catalytically competent state. Structures of complexes with Mg(2+)/ADP-ribose, Mg(2+)/ATP, and Mg(2+)/AMP suggest a mechanism for the ADP-ribose pyrophosphatase reaction that involves a rotation of the COG1058 domain dimer as part of the reaction cycle, so that each active site oscillates between open and closed forms, thus promoting catalysis."
https://openalex.org/W2059944252,"The classic dynamic autoregulatory index (ARI), proposed by Aaslid and Tiecks, is one of the most widely used methods to assess the efficiency of dynamic cerebral autoregulation. Although this index is often used in clinical research and is also included in some commercial equipment, it exhibits considerable intra-subject variability, and has the tendency to produce false positive results in clinical applications. An alternative index of dynamic cerebral autoregulation is proposed, which overcomes most of the limitations of the classic method and also has the advantage of being model-free. This new index uses two parameters that are obtained directly from the response signal of the cerebral blood flow velocity to a transient decrease in arterial blood pressure provoked by the sudden release of bilateral thigh cuffs, and a third parameter measuring the difference in slope of this response and the change in arterial blood pressure achieved. With the values of these parameters, a corresponding classic autoregulatory index value could be calculated by using a linear regression model built from theoretical curves generated with the Aaslid-Tiecks model. In 16 healthy subjects who underwent repeated thigh-cuff manoeuvres, the model-free approach exhibited significantly lower intra-subject variability, as measured by the unbiased coefficient of variation, than the classic autoregulatory index (p = 0.032) and the Rate of Return (p<0.001), another measure of cerebral autoregulation used for this type of systemic pressure stimulus, from 39.23%±41.91% and 55.31%±31.27%, respectively, to 15.98%±7.75%."
https://openalex.org/W1963519279,"Under normal conditions, loading activities result in microdamage in the living skeleton, which is repaired by bone remodeling. However, microdamage accumulation can affect the mechanical properties of bone and increase the risk of fracture. This study aimed to determine the effect of microdamage on the mechanical properties and composition of bone. Fourteen male goats aged 28 months were used in the present study. Cortical bone screws were placed in the tibiae to induce microdamage around the implant. The goats were euthanized, and 3 bone segments with the screws in each goat were removed at 0 days, 21 days, 4 months, and 8 months after implantation. The bone segments were used for observing microdamage and bone remodeling, as well as nanoindentation and bone composition, separately. Two regions were measured: the first region (R1), located 1.5 mm from the interface between the screw hole and bone; and the second region (R2), located>1.5 mm from the bone-screw interface. Both diffuse and linear microdamage decreased significantly with increasing time after surgery, with the diffuse microdamage disappearing after 8 months. Thus, screw implantation results in increased bone remodeling either in the proximal or distal cortical bone, which repairs the microdamage. Moreover, bone hardness and elastic modulus decreased with microdamage repair, especially in the proximal bone tissue. Bone composition changed greatly during the production and repair of microdamage, especially for the C (Carbon) and Ca (Calcium) in the R1 region. In conclusion, the presence of mechanical microdamage accelerates bone remodeling either in the proximal or distal cortical bone. The bone hardness and elastic modulus decreased with microdamage repair, with the micromechanical properties being restored on complete repair of the microdamage. Changes in bone composition may contribute to changes in bone mechanical properties."
https://openalex.org/W2022432601,"Osmolytes are low molecular weight organic molecules accumulated by organisms to assist proper protein folding, and to provide protection to the structural integrity of proteins under denaturing stress conditions. It is known that osmolyte-induced protein folding is brought by unfavorable interaction of osmolytes with the denatured/unfolded states. The interaction of osmolyte with the native state does not significantly contribute to the osmolyte-induced protein folding. We have therefore investigated if different denatured states of a protein (generated by different denaturing agents) interact differently with the osmolytes to induce protein folding. We observed that osmolyte-assisted refolding of protein obtained from heat-induced denatured state produces native molecules with higher enzyme activity than those initiated from GdmCl- or urea-induced denatured state indicating that the structural property of the initial denatured state during refolding by osmolytes determines the catalytic efficiency of the folded protein molecule. These conclusions have been reached from the systematic measurements of enzymatic kinetic parameters (Km and kcat), thermodynamic stability (Tm and ΔHm) and secondary and tertiary structures of the folded native proteins obtained from refolding of various denatured states (due to heat-, urea- and GdmCl-induced denaturation) of RNase-A in the presence of various osmolytes."
https://openalex.org/W1999131896,"Aminoacyl-tRNA synthetases (ARSs) are in charge of cellular protein synthesis and have additional domains that function in a versatile manner beyond translation. Eight core ARSs (EPRS, MRS, QRS, RRS, IRS, LRS, KRS, DRS) combined with three nonenzymatic components form a complex known as multisynthetase complex (MSC).We hypothesize that the single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) of the eight core ARS coding genes might influence the susceptibility of sporadic congenital heart disease (CHD). Thus, we conducted a case-control study of 984 CHD cases and 2953 non-CHD controls in the Chinese Han population to evaluate the associations of 16 potentially functional SNPs within the eight ARS coding genes with the risk of CHD. We observed significant associations with the risk of CHD for rs1061248 [G/A; odds ratio (OR) = 0.90, 95% confidence interval (CI) = 0.81–0.99; P = 3.81×10−2], rs2230301 [A/C; OR = 0.73, 95%CI = 0.60–0.90, P = 3.81×10−2], rs1061160 [G/A; OR = 1.18, 95%CI = 1.06–1.31; P = 3.53×10−3] and rs5030754 [G/A; OR = 1.39, 95%CI = 1.11–1.75; P = 4.47×10−3] of EPRS gene. After multiple comparisons, rs1061248 conferred no predisposition to CHD. Additionally, a combined analysis showed a significant dosage-response effect of CHD risk among individuals carrying the different number of risk alleles (Ptrend = 5.00×10−4). Compared with individuals with “0–2” risk allele, those carrying “3”, “4” or “5 or more” risk alleles had a 0.97-, 1.25- or 1.38-fold increased risk of CHD, respectively. These findings indicate that genetic variants of the EPRS gene may influence the individual susceptibility to CHD in the Chinese Han population."
https://openalex.org/W2023382815,"Mannose-binding lectin (MBL) is one of the five recognition molecules in the lectin complement pathway. Common variant alleles in the promoter and structural regions of the human MBL gene (MBL2) influence the stability and serum concentration of the protein. Epidemiological studies have shown that MBL2 variant alleles are associated with susceptibility to and the course of different types of infectious and inflammatory conditions. However, it has been suggested that these alleles are maintained in different populations due to selected advantages for carriers. We investigated the MBL2 allelic variation in indigenous individuals from 12 different West Central South America localities spanning from the desert coast, high altitude Andean plates and the Amazon tropical forest within the territories of Peru (n = 249) (Departments of Loreto, Ucayali, Lambayeque, Junin, Ayacucho, Huancayo and Puno), and Ecuador (n = 182) (Region of Esmeraldas and Santo Domingo de los Colorados). The distribution of MBL2 genotypes among the populations showed that the defective variant LYPB haplotype was very common. It showed the highest frequencies in Puno (Taquile (0.80), Amantani (0.80) and Anapia (0.58) islander communities of the Lake Titicaca), but lower frequencies of 0.22 in Junin (Central Andean highland) and Ucayali (Central Amazonian forest), as well as 0.27 and 0.24 in the Congoma and Cayapa/Chachis populations in the Amazonian forest in Ecuador were also observed. Our results suggest that the high prevalence of the MBL2 LYPB variant causing low levels of functional MBL in serum may mainly reflect a random distribution due to a population bottleneck in the founder populations."
https://openalex.org/W2003946324,"In this study, a sensitive dual-label time-resolved reverse competitive chemiluminescent immunoassay was developed for simultaneous detection of chloramphenicol (CAP) and clenbuterol (CLE) in milk. The strategy was performed based on the distinction of the kinetic characteristics of horseradish peroxidase (HRP) and alkaline phosphatase (ALP) in chemiluminesecence (CL) systems and different orders of magnitude in HRP CL value for CAP and ALP CL value for CLE in the chemiluminescent immunoassay. Capture antibodies were covalently bound to the amine group functionalized chemiluminescent microtiter plate (MTP) for efficient binding of detection antibodies for the enzymes labeled CAP (HRP-CAP) and CLE (ALP-CLE). The CL signals were recorded at different time points by the automatic luminometers with significant distinction in the dynamic curves. When we considered the ALP CL value (about 105) of CLE as background for HRP CL signal value (about 107) of CAP, there was no interaction from ALP CL background of CLE and the differentiation of CAP and CLE can be easily achieved. The 50% inhibition concentration (IC50) values of CAP and CLE in milk samples were 0.00501 µg L−1 and 0.0128 µg L−1, with the ranges from 0.0003 µg L−1 to 0.0912 µg L−1 and from 0.00385 µg L−1 to 0.125 µg L−1, respectively. The developed method is more sensitive and of less duration than the commercial ELISA kits, suitable for simultaneous screening of CAP and CLE."
https://openalex.org/W2137721801,"Perspective texture synthesis has great significance in many fields like video editing, scene capturing etc., due to its ability to read and control global feature information. In this paper, we present a novel example-based, specifically energy optimization-based algorithm, to synthesize perspective textures. Energy optimization technique is a pixel-based approach, so it's time-consuming. We improve it from two aspects with the purpose of achieving faster synthesis and high quality. Firstly, we change this pixel-based technique by replacing the pixel computation with a little patch. Secondly, we present a novel technique to accelerate searching nearest neighborhoods in energy optimization. Using k- means clustering technique to build a search tree to accelerate the search. Hence, we make use of principal component analysis (PCA) technique to reduce dimensions of input vectors. The high quality results prove that our approach is feasible. Besides, our proposed algorithm needs shorter time relative to other similar methods."
https://openalex.org/W2045372418,"Naïve CD4 T cells are triggered to undergo spontaneous proliferation, a proliferative response induced in response to homeostatic stimulation, when exposed to severe lymphopenic environments. They spontaneously acquire proinflammatory effector phenotypes, playing a major role in inducing chronic inflammation in the intestine that is believed to be induced by T cell recognition of commensal antigens. While the antigens inducing the T cell responses and inflammation are being extensively investigated, the role of clonality of T cells involved in this process remains poorly understood. In this study, we utilized naïve CD4 T cells isolated from B6 H2M-/- mice, in which MHCII molecules are complexed with a single CLIP molecule, and examined spontaneous proliferation and intestinal inflammation of CD4 T cells expressing limited T cell receptor repertoire diversity. We found that H2M-/- CD4 T cells undergo robust spontaneous proliferation, differentiate into IFNγ-producing Th1 type effector cells, and, most unexpectedly, induce severe acute hepatocellular necrosis. T cell interaction with MHCII molecule on cells of hematopoietic origin was essential to induce the pathology. Interestingly, B cells are fully capable of preventing necrotic inflammation via IL-10-independent and B7-H1-dependent mechanism. This could be a useful animal model to examine T cell-mediated liver inflammation and B cell-mediated immune regulation."
