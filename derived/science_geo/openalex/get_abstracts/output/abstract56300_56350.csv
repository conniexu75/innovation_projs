https://openalex.org/W1673905022,"An enzyme system which catalyzes the ω-hydroxylation of fatty acids in the presence of reduced triphosphopyridine nucleotide and molecular oxygen has been obtained in a soluble form from rabbit liver microsomes. Three components have been separated from the microsomal extract and shown to be required for the conversion of laurate to ω-hydroxylaurate. These have been identified as hemoprotein P-450 (the carbon monoxide-binding pigment of microsomes), TPNH-cytochrome c reductase, and a heat-stable factor."
https://openalex.org/W2020267550,"Hepatic microsomes contain an ethanol-oxidizing system distinct from alcohol dehydrogenase. In vitro, it has characteristics comparable to those of microsomal drug-detoxifying enzymes and, in vivo, it is capable of adaptation to the administration of ethanol. The existence of this microsomal ethanol-oxidizing system may explain ultrastructural, pharmacological, and biochemical effects of ethanol."
https://openalex.org/W1569266826,"Abstract Microbodies, designated as peroxisomes because of their enzyme complement, have been isolated from spinach leaves. After grinding leaves in 0.5 m sucrose, the peroxisomes were removed with the broken chloroplast fraction by differential centrifugation. During sucrose density gradient centrifugation, the peroxisomes banded in about 1.9 m sucrose and were separated from mitochondria and chloroplasts. The particles, 0.5 to 1.0 µ in diameter, contained a dense granular stroma surrounded by a single membrane. The leaf peroxisomes contained glycolate oxidase, DPNH-glyoxylate reductase, and catalase. Up to 55% of the activity for these enzymes in spinach leaves have been found in the particulate fractions after the initial centrifugation. The leaf peroxisomes are probably the site of oxygen uptake during photorespiration. No catalase activity was present in chloroplasts after removal of the peroxisomes by density gradient centrifugation. P-Glycolate phosphatase, TPNH-glyoxylate reductase, d-amino acid oxidase, urate oxidase, and peroxidase were not present in leaf peroxisomes."
https://openalex.org/W1986459950,"The pacemaker potential in Purkinje fibers is generated by a slow fall in potassium current which allows the inward background currents to depolarize the membrane. Adrenaline shifts the relation between activation of the potassium current and membrane potential in a depolarizing direction. Consequently, during the pacemaker potential, the potassium current falls more rapidly to lower values and the inward currents then depolarize the membrane more quickly. The shift in the potassium activation curve produced by adrenaline is large compared to that produced by calcium ions. The molecular action of adrenaline may involve either a large change in the surface charge of the membrane or a change in the dependence of the potassium permeability on the local electric field."
https://openalex.org/W1491580376,"Abstract A study of the TPNH-dependent utilization of the polyunsaturated fatty acids in the phospholipids of the microsomal membranes has shown that the process is enzymic in nature. TPNH is oxidized during the reaction and O2 is consumed. When all of the nucleotide is oxidized, both the lipid changes and the oxygen consumption stop. Addition of more TPNH (or a TPNH-regenerating system) reinitiates these activities. Parameters affecting the course of the reaction have been investigated, including studies with a number of inhibitors. The stoichiometry of the system has been determined with regard to TPNH, polyunsaturated fatty acid, and oxygen. Malondialdehyde is produced during this reaction, but it has been shown to be insignificant in terms of accounting for the polyunsaturated fatty acids which are utilized. The system bears some resemblance to that which synthesizes prostaglandins."

https://openalex.org/W2015213501,"The importance of adenyl cyclase and adenosine 3',5'-monophosphate in the induction of tyrosine aminotransferase by adrenocorticosteroids has been tested in HTC cells derived from a rat hepatoma and grown in tissue culture. Adrenocorticosteroids cause a 10-to 15-fold increase in the rate of synthesis of tyrosine aminotransferase in these cells. Under various experimental conditions, with or without glucocorticoids, neither adenyl cyclase nor cyclic adenosine mono-phosphate could be detected in HTC cells. In addition, neither the cyclic nucleotide nor N(6), O(2')-dibutyryl cyclic adenosine monophosphate caused increased activity of the transaminase in HTC cells. We conclude that induction of tyrosine aminotransferase by glucocorticoids is not mediated by the adenyl cyclase-cyclic adenosine monophosphate system."

https://openalex.org/W1589926992,"Abstract In the presence of TPNH, particulate cell-free preparations from Hansenula ciferri convert palmityl coenzyme A and serine-14C to labeled dihydrosphingosine and sphingosine. Both the free bases and their dinitrophenyl derivatives migrated identically with authentic standards on thin layer chromatograms. The identity of sphingosine, not previously reported as a biosynthetic product in yeast, was further confirmed by its catalytic reduction to dihydrosphingosine and by recrystallization of its triacetyl derivative to constant specific radioactivity in the presence of unlabeled authentic carrier. Both the biosynthetic sphingosine and dihydrosphingosine have the erythro configuration. In the absence of added TPNH, no sphingosine or dihydrosphingosine is formed by this system. Instead, two less stable, labeled compounds are formed, (a) 2-amino-1-hydroxyoctadecan-3-one (3-ketodihydrosphingosine), and (b) a compound which may be the 3-keto analogue of sphingosine. These intermediates are converted either enzymatically in the presence of TPNH or nonenzymatically with sodium borohydride to dihydrosphingosine and sphingosine. The most prominent labeled component of the mixture on acetylation chromatographs identically with authentic N-acetyl-3-ketodihydrosphingosine. Like the pyridoxal-P-dependent over-all reaction leading to dihydrosphingosine (1), formation of the labile intermediate, but not its reduction to dihydrosphingosine, is inhibited by cysteine. On the basis of these experiments, synthesis of dihydrosphingosine appears to proceed by a pyridoxal-P-dependent condensation of palmityl-CoA with serine to yield 3-ketodihydrosphingosine. TPNH-dependent reduction of this 3-keto intermediate then leads to dihydrosphingosine. The origin of other sphingolipid bases is discussed. 2-Hexadecenoate, but not α-hydroxypalmitate, replaces palmitate as a substrate in this crude cell-free system, but does not change the distribution of products. Phytosphingosine, the major sphingolipid base excreted by the growing yeast, is not formed in the cell-free system."

https://openalex.org/W145341622,"Abstract Incubation of bovine thyroid slices in the presence of thyroid-stimulating hormone resulted in increased slice content of adenosine 3',5'-phosphate. This effect of thyroid-stimulating hormone was potentiated by the inclusion of 1 mm theophylline in the incubation medium. In the presence or absence of theophylline, adenosine 3',5'-phosphate accumulation was maximally stimulated by 10 munits per ml of thyroid-stimulating hormone, and the highest nucleotide levels were attained by 3 to 6 minutes of incubation. Levels declined slowly following this early peak. The system responded similarly with two thyroid-stimulating hormone preparations of differing purities. Other peptide hormones tested were inactive. Among various chemical agents tested, only epinephrine was found to stimulate adenosine 3',5'-phosphate accumulation. This effect of epinephrine was half-maximal at 0.2 to 0.3 µm, but the magnitude of the response was small and its duration was brief as compared to the action of thyroid-stimulating hormone. The response to epinephrine was antagonized well by dichloroisoproterenol, but poorly by phenoxybenzamine."
https://openalex.org/W1508920867,"Abstract Hormonal regulation of the synthesis of hepatic tyrosine transaminase (l-tyrosine:2-oxoglutarate aminotransferase, EC 2.6.1.5) was studied in the isolated, perfused rat liver. Hydrocortisone, insulin, and glucagon, each of which increases the rate of synthesis of tyrosine transaminase when administered in vivo, were all found to do so by direct action on the liver. Induction by continuous infusion of hydrocortisone continued throughout the time course of the experiments (9 to 11 hours). Infusion of either insulin or glucagon initiated a rapid but limited increase in tyrosine transaminase synthesis, the maximum activity being attained 2½ to 3 hours after the initial addition of these hormones. The hormonal inductions of this enzyme were all sensitive to actinomycin D. Growth hormone, which mediates a selective repression of tyrosine transaminase synthesis when administered to adrenalectomized rats in vivo, did not alter the level of this enzyme in the isolated, perfused rat liver, suggesting that this hormone acts indirectly."

https://openalex.org/W2039535189,Two electrophoretically distinct variants of supernatant nicotinamideadenine dinucleotide phosphate-dependent malate dehydrogenase exist in mice (Mus musculus). They are controlled by codominant alleles segregating at an autosomal locus. The two forms exist in a polymorphic condition in wild populations of Mus musculus and are fixed in a homozygous condition in inbred lines. These genetic electrophoretic variants are used here to study the subunit structure of this enzyme. Evidence indicating a tetrameric structure for mouse nicotinamideadenine dinucleotide phosphate-dependent malate dehydrogenase is presented. This interpretation is based on the occurrence in heterozygote tissue extracts of five electrophoretically distinct enzymes. This is the predicted phenotype for tetramers composed of two types of subunits which associate randomly in heterozygotes forming three hybrid enzymes having mobilities intermediate between the parental forms.

https://openalex.org/W1524564474,"Abstract Enzyme formation during differentiation was studied by administering hormones to individual fetal rats in utero and comparing them with their untreated mates. Thyroxine raises considerably the levels of glucose 6-phosphatase and NADPH: cytochrome c oxidoreductase in fetal livers: within 5 and 24 hours, respectively, both enzymes reach approximately half of their adult levels. Glucagon has a similar effect on glucose 6-phosphatase but does not affect NADPH dehydrogenase, whereas tyrosine aminotransferase, the synthesis of which can be prematurely initiated by glucagon, is unaffected by thyroxine. Hydrocortisone acetate does not increase the level of any of these enzymes studied in fetal liver; it causes a small decrease in glucose 6-phosphatase. The different responses of the three enzymes to the experimental stimuli are in accord with their different developmental patterns. Fetal thyroid hormone is most probably the immediate cause for the first appearance of liver glucose 6-phosphatase and NADPH dehydrogenase during late gestation. The second upsurge of glucose 6-phosphatase activity and the first appearance of tyrosine aminotransferase are conditioned by the early postnatal secretion of glucagon. The results emphasize the plasticity of the developmental formation of enzymes; the role of fetal endocrine function in this aspect of differentiation may be approached by experimentally induced changes in the enzyme profile."
https://openalex.org/W1527772460,"Abstract 6β-Hydroxylation of chenodeoxycholic acid-24-14C and taurochenodeoxycholic acid-24-14C was demonstrated in vitro by cell-free preparations of rat liver. The enzymic activity, requiring O2 and NADPH, was located in the microsomes prepared in 0.1 m phosphate buffer and could be stimulated by addition of the 105,000 x g supernatant fluid. The microsomal fraction prepared in 0.01 m phosphate buffer had full activity and was not further stimulated by the 105,000 x g supernatant fluid. A clear extract made by suspending this microsomal pellet in 1.0 m phosphate and subsequently centrifuging it at 105,000 x g contained the complete 6β-hydroxylase system. The activity of the 1.0 m phosphate extract was inhibited by sulfhydryl reagents, Cu++, cytochrome c, and CO. The inhibition by CO could be reversed by light. The presence of cytochrome b5 and the CO-binding pigment, P-450, in the extract was detected by differential spectrophotometry."
https://openalex.org/W1488238981,"The participation of 3-ketosteroids in the biosynthesis of cholesterol was investigated with preparations of rat liver microsomes. Without exogenous NADPH, microsomal enzymes catalyze the demethylation of one methyl group from 4,4-dimethyl-5α-cholest-7-en-3β-ol to yield carbon dioxide and 4-methyl-5α-cholest-7-en-3-one. Equal molar quantities of the two products are formed when either the amount of microsomal protein or the length of incubation is varied. The labeled methyl ketone was identified by chromatography and derivative formation with carrier 4α-methyl-5α-cholest-7-en-3-one. 5α-Cholest-7-en-3-one is formed similarly from 4α-methyl-5α-cholest-7-en-3β-ol. Measurement of the stoichiometry of formation of carbon dioxide and cholest-7-en-3-one is complicated somewhat by reduction of the product ketone to an alcohol. 4α-Methyl-, 4,4-Dimethyl-, and 4,4,14α-Trimethyl-Δ7-cholestenols and -cholestenones were synthesized. The efficiency of demethylation of the 3-alcohols by microsomes is inversely proportional to the number of methyl groups on the substrate. Hydroxylation is the first step of demethylation; the 4-methyl groups of 4,4-dimethyl-5α-cholest-7-en-3-one and 4α-methyl-5α-cholest-7-en-3-one are not hydroxylated. The 4-methyl groups of the corresponding alcohols are hydroxylated. Thus, the 4-methyl ketone that is produced by demethylation of one methyl group from the 4,4-dimethyl sterol must be reduced to an alcohol before further metabolism. Although both alcoholic and ketonic forms of the methyl steroids are demethylated by either crude homogenates or unwashed microsomes from rat liver, the ketones are not demethylated by washed microsomes. Addition to washed microsomes of either the supernatant fraction from centrifugation of crude homogenates for 1 hour at 105,000 × g or an NADPH-generating system simultaneously restores the reduction and demethylation of ketones by microsomes. Microsomes contain an NADPH-dependent 3-ketosteroid reductase. This evidence supports the conclusion that 4-monomethyl and 4-demethyl ketones are obligatory intermediates of cholesterol biosynthesis. Dimethyl and trimethyl ketones probably are in equilibrium with the corresponding 3-alcohols, but the C29- and C30-ketones probably are not obligatory intermediates of C27-sterol biosynthesis."
https://openalex.org/W1561152126,"Abstract It has been confirmed that borohydride treatment of d-amino acid oxidase in the presence of d-alanine-1-14C leads to the strong attachment to the apoprotein of 1 mole of 14C per eq of FAD originally present. However this reaction, and a similar one with l-amino acid oxidase, does not result in any loss of catalytic activity. With both enzymes, borohydride reaction in the absence of substrate results in the production of a new flavin derivative, not previously reported. This modified flavin, characterized by an absorption maximum at 408 to 410 mµ, can be liberated by heat denaturation. It has intense blue fluorescence with an emission maximum at 475 mµ. On conversion to the flavin mononucleotide form there is an approximately 10-fold increase in fluorescence intensity."
https://openalex.org/W1493368624,"Abstract A triphosphopyridine nucleotide-specific isocitrate dehydrogenase from Salmonella typhimurium has been shown to be inhibited by purine nucleoside di- and triphosphates. Other nucleotides do not have the same capacity to inhibit the reaction, and the presence of both a purine nucleus and a pyrophosphate moiety seems to be necessary. The nucleotides appear to have a dual action. At low concentration they are competitive inhibitors of TPN+, and at higher concentration they are primarily competitive inhibitors of isocitrate. Evaluation of kinetic data indicates a distinct difference in mechanism of inhibition between ATP and sodium pyrophosphate with respect to the coenzyme. Competition with TPN+ appears to be a function of the purine nucleus, while that with isocitrate probably is due to chelation of Mn++ by the pyrophosphate grouping of the nucleotide."

https://openalex.org/W1507638955,"Abstract 17β-Hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase has been isolated from human red cells and purified 740 times. The enzyme is sensitive to ionic strength and is most effective at sodium chloride concentrations of 0.1 m and above. 17β-Estradiol 3-sulfate reacts at a faster rate than 17β-estradiol. The Km for estradiol is 9.1 x 10-5, and for estradiol sulfate it is 3.8 x 10-4. The free compound has a pH optimum of 9.7; the sulfate reacts optimally at pH 9.0. The enzyme is specific for TPN; DPN shows one-sixth to one-tenth as much activity. The Km values for TPN are 2.7 x 10-5 with estradiol and 2.4 x 10-5 with estradiol sulfate. Acetyl-TPN is less active than TPN. Albumin inhibits the reaction, presumably by binding the steroids. Organic solvents also act inhibitorily. The enzyme appears to be of the sulfhydryl type. Enzyme activity was assayed by measurement of TPNH produced and by yield of estrone. Reduction of estrone or its sulfate occurs at slower rates than the corresponding reverse reactions. The molecular weight of the enzyme, calculated from mobility data on Sephadex gel, is approximately 75,500."

https://openalex.org/W1627289900,"Abstract The possible role of adenosine 3',5'-phosphate in mediating certain effects of thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) on the carbohydrate metabolism of bovine thyroid slices has been studied by examination of the TSH concentration dependence of the effects, the effects of theophylline on the parameters, and the effects of N6,2'-O-dibutyryl adenosine 3',5'-phosphate. Evidence has been obtained that adenosine 3',5'-phosphate mediates TSH-induced depression of 14CO2 obtained from glucose-1-14C and TSH-stimulated accumulation of lactate in the medium. TSH, at concentrations that lowered the yield of 14CO2 from glucose-1-14C, did not influence the quantity of 14CO2 obtained from glucose-6-14C. The mechanism of this effect is unclear, but does not appear to involve enhancement of glycogenolysis. The oxidation of pyruvate-14C to 14CO2 has also been studied, and the evidence suggests that adenosine 3',5'-phosphate is not involved in the stimulation of this oxidation by TSH. Adenosine 3',5'-phosphate also does not appear to be a mediator of the TSH-stimulated oxidation of glucose-1-14C to 14CO2 which is apparent only at high concentrations of TSH in bovine thyroid slices. Changes in the total concentration of oxidized and reduced triphosphopyridine nucleotides were not apparent with levels of TSH that stimulated the oxidation of glucose-1-14C to 14CO2."
https://openalex.org/W2298395464,"The activity of chicken liver dihydrofolic reductase, which catalyzes the reduced pyridine nucleotide-dependent reduction of folate or dihydrofolate to tetrahydrofolate, is stimulated approximately 4-fold by 4 m urea and 8-fold by 1.6 m thiourea when TPNH and dihydrofolate serve as substrates. When folic acid and TPNH are the substrates, relatively slight stimulation of activity is observed with concentrations of urea or thiourea less than 1 m . At higher concentrations, these reagents are inhibitory. On the other hand, both urea and thiourea are markedly inhibitory when DPNH and dihydrofolate are used as substrates. With increasing concentrations of urea, the double pH-activity profile (optima at pH 4 and pH 7.4) of the enzyme is shifted to a profile exhibiting a single pH optimum, at approximately 6.5, when TPNH and dihydrofolate serve as substrates. No significant changes are observed when folate and TPNH or dihydrofolate and DPNH are used as substrates. As the concentration of urea or thiourea is increased to the optimum concentration for stimulation, the Vmax increases approximately 4- to 10-fold with respect to TPNH or dihydrofolate, whereas as the apparent Km for dihydrofolate increases approximately 80-fold the Km for TPNH increases only about 4-fold. Under similar conditions, no significant changes in the Km values for folate or DPNH are evident. The enthalpy of activation also increases with increasing concentration of the activating reagents, from +12.6 to +15.4 kcal per mole. At optimum stimulatory concentrations of urea or thiourea, the first order half-life for enzyme activity is markedly decreased (1½ min at 30°). This half-life increases to 22 min in the presence of 0.1 m m TPNH. Significant stabilization of the stimulated enzyme is observed also in the presence of similar concentrations of folate, dihydrofolate, TPN, or 20% glycerol. This loss of enzyme activity in 4 m urea is reversible on dilution, whereas the loss in 1.4 m thiourea appears to be irreversible. These observations are consistant with an activation of dihydrofolic reductase resulting from a conformational change in the enzyme protein induced by the presence of high concentrations of urea or thiourea concomitant with the binding of TPNH."

It was present in highest concentration in cell extracts after growth of the organism on ethylene glycol or ethanol. 2. The enzyme from ethanol-grown cells was purified approximately 20-fold. A 23% recovery of enzyme was obtained and the purified preparation appeared to be at least 95% homogeneous as evidenced by gel filtration, ultracentrifugation, and electrophoresis. 3. Instability of the enzyme was overcome by using sodium bisulfite in the buffer systems, and the stability of the enzyme under various conditions of temperature, pH, and salt concentration was studied. 4. The aldehyde dehydrogenase requires potassium or ammonium ions for activity. Some activity is also obtained in the presence of rubidium ions. Nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide is a better hydrogen acceptor than nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate and a wide variety of aldehydes are oxidized. The Michaelis constants for glycolaldehyde, glyceraldehyde, nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide, nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate, potassium, and ammonium were determined. 5. A mercaptan is required for maximum activity. This requirement can be partly replaced by chelating agents. 6.

https://openalex.org/W1559873796,Abstract A variety of anionic compounds was studied as inhibitors of d-amino acid oxidase by means of a recently described spectrophotometric assay for the enzyme. Several phosphorus- and sulfur-containing acids were shown not to be effective inhibitors of the enzyme. A series of meta- and para-substituted benzoic acid derivatives was studied as inhibitors and the σρ relationship obtained indicated the binding of these compounds to be facilitated by electron-withdrawing substituent groups. A variety of saturated and unsaturated carboxylic acids was evaluated as substrate-competitive inhibitors of the enzyme. It is indicated that these inhibitors interact with a positively charged group of the enzyme that is a critical distance from an aromatic residue contained in a limited nonpolar region of the enzyme. It is suggested that the aromatic residue of the protein interacts with the inhibitors through electron donation. Steric interactions involved in the binding of inhibitors were also observed.

https://openalex.org/W1618428643,"Abstract Incubation of a highly purified, Mg++-dependent nucleoside diphosphokinase (EC 2.7.4.6) of bovine liver mitochondria with p-chloromercuriphenylsulfonate (CMS) caused activation at low concentrations and inactivation at higher concentrations of CMS. Inactivation was greatly accelerated in the presence of Mg++, suggesting that Mg++ stabilizes a form of the enzyme in which essential thiol groups are more reactive to CMS. MgADP, on the other hand, completely prevented inactivation of the enzyme by CMS. Free ADP, ATP, and MgATP alone gave slight protection, and AMP, flavin mononucleotide, flavin adenine dinucleotide, NAD+, NADP+, and pyrophosphate were completely ineffective. These findings indicate that MgADP favors an equilibrium form of the enzyme with diminished reactivity of essential thiol groups. They are also consistent with earlier studies (Goffeau, A., Pedersen, P. L., and Lehninger, A. L., J. Biol. Chem., 242, 1845 (1967)) showing that MgADP is a potent inhibitor of enzyme activity. Magnesium uridine diphosphate and magnesium cytidine diphosphate also protected against inactivation by CMS in proportion to their effectiveness as inhibitors of the enzymatic reaction. The apparent binding constants of MgADP, either as substrate or inhibitor, remained unchanged in the presence of CMS, suggesting that the mercurial is able to react selectively with one form of the enzyme while leaving the other form completely active. Addition of 2-mercaptoethanol caused activation at low concentrations, but at high concentrations produced an inhibited state of the enzyme. MgADP did not protect against the inhibitory effect of mercaptoethanol. From these experiments, at least three equilibrium forms of the enzyme can be recognized: an active form stabilized by Mg++, an inhibited form stabilized by MgADP, and an inactive form in which the essential thiol group (or groups) is oxidized."
https://openalex.org/W1492136642,"Abstract Liver NAD and NADH each decreased by 25 to 40% in animals fed a nicotinamide-deficient diet for 4 weeks. In contrast, the nicotinamide-deficient diet had a negligible effect on the amount of liver NADP and NADPH, suggesting a closer regulation by the body of the levels of the latter two compounds. Adrenal steroids prevented the depletion of NAD and NADH which otherwise occurred in rats fed the nicotinamide-deficient diet. Moreover, in animals in which liver NAD and NADH had been depleted by feeding the deficient diet, the levels of these coenzymes could be restored to normal, or above normal, by steroid administration. Administration of steroids also increased the amount of NADP and NADPH. Evidence is presented that the ability of the steroids to increase the levels of the pyridine nucleotides is mediated by increasing the availability of tryptophan. The present results provide an explanation for our previous observations that adrenocortical steroids are able to prevent nicotinamide deficient disease and even cause its remission."

The enzyme is a nonmetalloflavoprotein with flavin adenine dinucleotide as the prosthetic group, and it catalyzes the reduction of R. spheroides cytochrome c2, 2,6-dichloroindophenol, and K3Fe(CN)6 with NADPH as the electron donor. It does not reduce R. spheroides cytochrome 553 but reduces Rhodospirillum rubrum cytochrome c2 and mammalian cytochrome c very slowly.

Polyadenylic acid (poly A) stimulates the activity of dGMP kinase only. Polyuridylic acid (poly U) or polyinosinic acid (poly I) is inactive in this respect. A selective stimulation of DNA synthesis occurs in comparison to RNA and protein syntheses when the active polymers are added to cell suspensions. Enzyme synthesis, rather than enzyme activity, is affected by the active polyribonucleotides. This is shown by the fact that (a) chloramphenicol inhibits stimulatory effects of the active polymers, (b) omission of amino acids from the suspending medium reduces the stimulatory effects considerably, and (c) the specific activity of dCMP kinase purified from stimulated pneumococci is 4- to 5-fold higher than dCMP kinase extracted from a similar number of unstimulated pneumococci. The active intracellular materials appear to be oligomers of cytidylic or adenylic acid. Copolymers of various kinds (poly AC, poly UC, or poly GC) are less effective than the homopolymers and a molecular complex of poly C + poly I is completely ineffective. Poly C, but not its oligomers, can form a molecular complex with pneumococcal RNA or denatured pneumococcal DNA in vitro. However, complex formation in vitro is inhibited considerably if the RNA is extracted from cells pre-exposed to oligomers of cytidylic acid or poly C."

https://openalex.org/W1498450558,"Abstract A disulfide reductase with characteristics different from those previously described in the literature was isolated from Achromobacter starkeyi. The enzyme was purified approximately 90-fold from cell-free extracts prepared with a Hughes press. Oxidized glutathione was the only natural substrate utilized by the partially purified enzyme. However, the enzyme showed a higher affinity and higher activity for the synthetic compound 5,5'-dithiobis(2-nitrobenzoic acid). The enzyme could utilize both NADH and NADPH as electron donors, but it was more active with NADPH. The optimum pH was 7.0, and the optimum temperature was about 28°. The enzyme was highly susceptible to the presence of divalent cations and iodoacetate, but arsenite and N-ethylmaleimide showed only a slight inhibitory effect. The enzyme was slowly inactivated when it was incubated in the presence of NADH or NADPH."
https://openalex.org/W1577025479,"Abstract The two mitochondrial xylitol dehydrogenases of guinea pig liver have been studied with a view to determining their intramitochondrial locations. By procedures involving swelling, shrinking, and sonic oscillation of the particles, followed by centrifugation in a discontinuous sucrose gradient, preparations representing solubilized enzymes, outer membranes, and inner fraction were obtained. Comparisons with the distribution of marker enzymes indicate that NAD-xylitol dehydrogenase is weakly bound to the outer membrane or is present between the inner and outer membranes, or both, whereas NADP-xylitol dehydrogenase appears to be located in the matrix confined by the inner membrane or bound to the inner membrane. The possible implications of the compartmentalization of these enzymes of the glucuronate-xylulose cycle are discussed."
