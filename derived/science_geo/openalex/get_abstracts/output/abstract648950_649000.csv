https://openalex.org/W3011106876,"Securinega suffruticosa (Pall.) Rehd is an excellent natural secondary shrub in the Shell Islands of Yellow River Delta. The roots of S. suffruticosa have high medicinal value and are used to treat diseases, such as neurasthenia and infant malnutrition. Any organism that is isolated from this species is of immense interest due to its potential novel bioactive compounds. In this research, the distribution and diversity of culturable endophytic fungi in S. suffruticosa were studied, and the endophytic fungi with antimicrobial activity were screened. A total of 420 endophytic fungi isolates were obtained from the S. suffruticosa grown in Shell Islands, from which 20 genera and 35 species were identified through morphological and internal transcribed spacer (ITS) sequence analyses. Chaetomium, Fusarium, Cladosporium, and Ceratobasidium were the dominant genera. The high species richness S (42), Margalef index D' (5.6289), Shannon-Wiener index H' (3.1000), Simpson diversity index Ds (0.9459), PIE index (0.8670), and evenness Pielou index J (0.8719) and a low dominant index λ (0.0541) indicated the high diversity of endophytic fungi in S. suffruticosa, the various species of endophytic fungi with obvious tissue specificity. The inhibition percentages of the 12 species of such endophytic fungi against Colletotrichum siamense were 3.6%-26.3%. C. globosum, Fusarium sp.3, and C. ramotenellum had a high antibacterial activity against Enterococcus faecalis, Escherichia coli, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and Staphylococcus aureus. The Minimum Inhibitory Concentration (MIC) and the Minimum Bactericidal Concentration (MBC) were between 0.5 mg/mL and 2 mg/mL. Alkaloid content detection indicated that endophytic fungi had a high alkaloid content, whereas the alkaloid contents of C. globosum and Fusarium sp.3 reached 0.231% and 0.170%, respectively. Members belonging to the endophytic fungal community in the S. suffruticosa of Shell Islands that may be used as antagonists and antibacterial agents for future biotechnology applications were identified for the first time."
https://openalex.org/W3010865200,"Background and aims Fecal microbial transplantation (FMT), a treatment for certain gastrointestinal conditions associated with dysbiosis in people, is also empirically employed in horses with colitis. This study used microbiota high-throughput sequencing to compare the fecal microbial profile of healthy horses to that of geriatric microbial transplant recipients experiencing diarrhea and tested whether FMT restores microbiota diversity. Methods To evaluate the effect of environment and donor characteristics on the intestinal microbiota, fecal samples were collected per rectum from 15 healthy young-adult (2-12 years) and 15 geriatric (≥20 years) horses. Additionally, FMT was performed for 3 consecutive days in 5 geriatric horses with diarrhea using feces from the same healthy donor. Fecal samples were collected from both donor and recipient prior to each FMT and from recipients 24 hours following the last FMT. The profile of the fecal bacterial microbiota was compared using 16S amplicon sequencing. Results and conclusions In contrast to diet and farm location, age did not significantly affect the healthy equine fecal microbiota, indicating that both healthy geriatric and young-adult horses may serve as FMT donors. The fecal microbiota of horses with diarrhea was significantly more variable in terms of β-diversity than that of healthy horses. An inverse correlation between diarrhea score and relative abundance of Verrucomicrobia was identified in surviving FMT recipients. At study completion, the fecal microbiota of horses which responded to FMT had a higher α-diversity than prior to treatment and was phylogenetically more similar to that of the donor."
https://openalex.org/W3010769679,"Background Bacterial infection is one of the leading causes of mortality in young infants globally. The standard practice to manage young infants with any sign of possible serious bacterial infection (PSBI) is in a hospital setting with parenteral antibiotics, which may not be feasible for majority of cases in most low resource settings. The World Health Organization developed a guideline on management of PSBI in young infants when referral is not feasible in 2016. Methods We conducted implementation research in selected communities in Zaria Local Government Areas of Kaduna State with an estimated population of 50,000 with the aim of understanding how to implement the WHO PSBI treatment guideline to achieve high coverage with low case fatality and treatment failure rates. Implementation was within the programmatic settings using existing health structure. We conducted policy dialogue with decision makers to adapt the recommendations to their social, cultural and programmatic context in Nigeria, held orientation meetings with program managers, built capacity of the health workers and supported the implementation within the health system. We supported a non-government organization to conduct community sensitization to promote care seeking and adherence to treatment advice. The research team collected data systematically on all young infants identified to have PSBI, the treatment they received and the clinical outcome. Results Between April 2016 and March 2017, we identified 347 young infants up to 2 months of age with signs of PSBI who received treatment either as an outpatient or in a hospital among 2,154 births in the study population. The coverage of PSBI treatment in the study area was 95.5% assuming that 10% of all births have an episode of PSBI in the first two months of life. Most (89%) sick young infants with PSBI were identified by the community-oriented resource persons and sent to the Primary Health Care Centres (PHCs). Most families (97%) refused referral and were treated at a primary health care centre on outpatient basis. There were 12 deaths (3.5%) and 17 non-death treatment failures (4.9%) in 343 infants in whom an outcome could be ascertained. While non-death treatment failure rate was highest in 0-6-day infants with fast breathing (14.4%), case fatality was highest in those with signs of critical illness (20%). Conclusion We have demonstrated that outpatient treatment strategy for young infants with PSBI when referral is not feasible is implementable within the programmatic settings, achieving very high population coverage and relatively low treatment failure and case fatality rates. Implementation at scale will require government’s commitment to strengthen the health system with trained, motivated health care providers and necessary commodities."
https://openalex.org/W3012377300,"In this study, the presence of Leishmania DNA and blood feeding sources in phlebotomine sand fly species commonly present in Sicily were investigated. A total of 1,866 female sand flies including 176 blood fed specimens were sampled over two seasons in five selected sites in Sicily (southern Italy). Sergentomyia minuta (n = 1,264) and Phlebotomus perniciousus (n = 594) were the most abundant species at all the sites, while three other species from the genus Phlebotomus (i.e., P. sergenti n = 4, P. perfiliewi n = 3 and P. neglectus n = 1) were only sporadically captured. Twenty-eight out of the 1,866 (1.5%) sand flies tested positive for Leishmania spp. Leishmania tarentolae DNA was identified in 26 specimens of S. minuta, while the DNA of Leishmania donovani complex was detected in a single specimen each of S. minuta and P. perniciosus. Interestingly, seven S. minuta specimens (0.4%) tested positive for reptilian Trypanosoma sp. Blood sources were successfully identified in 108 out of 176 blood fed females. Twenty-seven out of 82 blood sources identified in fed females of P. perniciosus were represented by blood of wild rabbit, S. minuta mainly fed on humans (16/25), while the sole P. sergenti fed specimen took a blood meal on rat. Other vertebrate hosts including horse, goat, pig, dog, chicken, cow, cat and donkey were recognized as blood sources for P. perniciosus and S. minuta, and, surprisingly, no reptilian blood was identified in blood-fed S. minuta specimens. Results of this study agree with the well-known role of P. perniciosus as vector of L. infantum in the western Mediterranean; also, vector feeding preferences herein described support the hypothesis on the involvement of lagomorphs as sylvatic reservoirs of Leishmania. The detection of L. donovani complex in S. minuta, together with the anthropophilic feeding-behaviour herein observed, warrants further research to clarify the capacity of this species in the transmission of pathogens to humans and other animals."
https://openalex.org/W3011636074,"The European Action Plan for Sexual and Reproductive Health emphasizes the importance of improving access to contraceptive services for disadvantaged groups. However, a prior study showed that the prevalence of abortion is two times higher among refugees compared to non-immigrants in Norway. Similarly, a recent study reported that 50% of Somali women in Oslo had unintended childbirth on one occasion or more. These findings are supported by several studies in Europe that showed immigrant and refugee women have higher rates of unintended pregnancy and abortion than Non-immigrant women, and more than half of immigrants, who seek abortion are not using any form of contraception, raising concerns about their access to utilization of modern contraception. However, none of these studies have explored reasons underlying immigrant women's underutilization of modern contraception. The present study aimed to explore the barriers and facilitators to contraceptive usage among Somali immigrant women in Oslo area.A qualitative study using unstructured in-depth interviews with twenty one Somali women of reproductive age, >18 years, was conducted in Oslo from May-August 2018. The participants were recruited using purposive sampling method. Interviews began with a general question and were followed with some probing questions, and were continued until data saturation was reached. Data were analyzed using thematic analysis.Although the majority of the participants were educated, aware of the importance of contraceptive methods and interested in child spacing, systemic and socio-cultural barriers were found to be hindering their access to contraception. Several barriers were identified, including: language problems, lack of adequate information, religious beliefs, gender roles and social pressure.Eliminating the barriers which prevent women from receiving their desired form of contraception will have important public health implications, including lengthening inter-pregnancy intervals, and fewer unplanned pregnancies and abortions. These findings can support policy makers, civil society organizations and health providers to develop cultural sensitive programmes and educational interventions, which help Somali immigrant women overcome the identified barriers to contraception."
https://openalex.org/W3009566959,"Native bees provide essential pollination services in both natural and managed ecosystems. However, declines in native bee species highlight the need for increased understanding of land management methods that can promote healthy, persistent populations and diverse communities. This can be challenging and costly using traditional scientific methods, but citizen science can overcome many limitations. In this study, we examined the distribution and abundance of an agriculturally important wild bee species, the squash bee (Eucera (Peponapis) pruinosa, Hymenoptera: Apidae). They are ground nesting, specialist bees that depend on cultivated varieties of Cucurbita (squash, pumpkins, gourds). The intimate relationship between squash bees and their host plants suggests that they are likely sensitive to farm management practices, particularly those that disturb the soil. In this study, citizen scientists across Michigan used a survey to submit field management and bee observation data. Survey results indicated that squash bees occupy a wide geographic range and are more abundant in farms with reduced soil disturbance. Citizen science provided an inexpensive and effective method for examining impacts of farm management practices on squash bees and could be a valuable tool for monitoring and conserving other native pollinators."
https://openalex.org/W3010800801,"Objective To evaluate the added value of diffusion weighted image (DWI) including volumetric analysis to standard magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) for predicting poor responders to neoadjuvant chemotherapy in patients with osteosarcoma at 3-Tesla. Methods 3-Tesla Standard MRI and DWI in 17 patients were reviewed by two independent readers. Standard MRI was reviewed using a five-level-confidence score. Two-dimensional (2D) apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC)mean and 2D ADCminimum were measured from a single-section region of interest. An ADC histogram derived from whole-tumor volume was generated including 3D ADCmean, 3D ADCskewness, and 3D ADCkurtosis. The Mann-Whitney-U test, receiver operating characteristic curve with area under the curve (AUC) analysis, and multivariate logistic regression analysis were performed. Results There were 13 poor responders and 4 good responders. Statistical differences were found in posttreatment and percent change of both 2D ADCmean and 2D ADCminimum, posttreatment 3D ADCmean, and posttreatment 3D ADCskewness between two groups. The best predictors of poor responders were posttreatment 2D ADCmean and posttreatment 3D ADCskewness. Sensitivity and specificity of the 1st model (standard MRI alone), 2nd model (standard MRI+posttreatment 2D ADCmean), and 3rd model (standard MRI+posttreatment 2D ADCmean+posttreatment 3D ADCskewness) were 85% and 25%, 85% and 75%, and 85% and 100% for reader 1 and 77% and 25%, 77% and 50%, and 85% and 100% for reader 2, respectively. The AUC of the 1st, 2nd, and 3rd models were 0.548, 0.798, and 0.923 for reader 1 and 0.510, 0.635, and 0.923 for reader 2, respectively. Conclusion The addition of DWI including volumetric analysis to standard MRI improves the diagnostic accuracy for predicting poor responders to neoadjuvant chemotherapy in patients with osteosarcoma at 3-Tesla."
https://openalex.org/W3012015620,"Reducing Amyloid β (Aβ) in the brain is of fundamental importance for advancing the therapeutics for Alzheimer`s disease. The endogenous metallopeptidase neprilysin (NEP) has been identified as one of the key Aβ-degrading enzymes. Delivery of NEP to the brain by utilizing the Brain Shuttle (BS) transport system offers a promising approach for clearing central Aβ. We fused the extracellular catalytic domain of NEP to an active or inactive BS module. The two BS-NEP constructs were used to investigate the pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamics relationships in the blood and the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) in dose-response and multiple dosing. As previously shown, NEP was highly effective at degrading Aβ in blood but not in the CSF compartment after systemic administration. In contrast, the NEP with an active BS module led to a significant CSF exposure of BS-NEP, followed by substantial Aβ reduction in CSF and brain parenchyma. Our data show that a BS module against the transferrin receptor facilitates the transport of an Aβ degrading enzyme across the blood-brain barriers to efficiently reduce Aβ levels in both CSF and brain."
https://openalex.org/W3010241354,"Leptospirosis is one of the most widespread zoonotic diseases and can infect both humans and animals worldwide. Healthy cat, as a potential source of exposure to humans, are likely underestimated owing to the lack of overt clinical signs associated with Leptospira spp. infection in this species. The aim of the study was to determine the exposure, shedding, and carrier status of leptospires in shelter cats in Malaysia by using serological, molecular, and bacteriological methods. For this study, 82 healthy cats from two shelters were sampled. The blood, urine, and kidneys were tested using the microscopic agglutination test (MAT), polymerase chain reaction (PCR), and bacterial culture. On the basis of serological, molecular, and/or culture techniques, the total detection of leptospiral infection was 29.3% (n = 24/82). Through culture techniques, 16.7% (n = 4/24) of the cats that tested positive were carriers with positive kidney cultures, and one cat was culture positive for both urine and kidney. The Leptospira spp. isolates were identified as pathogenic L. interrogans serovar Bataviae through serological and molecular methods. Through serological techniques, 87.5% (n = 21/24) had positive antibody titers (100–1600) and most of the Bataviae serogroup (n = 19/21). Using PCR, 16.7% (n = 4/24) of cats were shown to have pathogenic Leptospira spp. DNA in their urine. Furthermore, three out of four culture positive cats were serology negative. The present study reports the first retrieval of pathogenic leptospires from urine and kidneys obtained from naturally infected cats. The results provide evidence of the potential role of naturally infected cats in the transmission of leptospires. Additionally, leptospiral infection occurs sub-clinically in cats. The culture isolation provides evidence that healthy cats could be reservoirs of leptospiral infection, and this information may promote the development of disease prevention strategies for the cat population."
https://openalex.org/W3011216258,"The data layer devices in the Software Defined Network (SDN) play an important role in packet forwarding. However, whether the forwarding task can be efficiently completed by the node has not attracted enough attention. A method called TrustBlock is proposed in this paper, which introduces trust as a security attribute in SDN routing planning. Besides, in order to enhance the integrity and controllability of trust evaluation, the double-layer blockchain architecture is established. In the first layer, the behavior data of the node is recorded, and then the trust calculation is performed in the second layer. In the evaluation model, nodes’ trust is calculated from three aspects: direct trust, indirect trust and historical trust. Firstly, from the perspective of security, blockchain is used to achieve identity authentication of nodes, after that, from the perspective of reliability, the forwarding status is used to calculate the trust value. Secondly, consensus algorithm is used to filter malicious recommendation trust value and prevent colluding attacks. Finally, the adaptive historical trust weight is designed to prevent the periodic attack. In this paper, the entropy method is used to determine the weight of each evaluation attribute, which can avoid the problem that the subjective judgment method is not adaptable to the weight setting. Simulation results show that the detection rate of the TrustBlock is up to 98.89%, which means this model can effectively identify the abnormal nodes in SDN. Moreover, it is attractive in terms of integrity and controllability."
https://openalex.org/W3011523857,"Objective Hepatitis B virus infection is a major social and economic burden in developing countries, especially in China. We aimed to evaluate the effects of hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg) positive status on the pregnancy outcomes in the Chinese population. Methods This retrospective cohort study was performed using data from the Medical Birth Registry of Xiamen, China, from January 2011 to March 2018. Multivariate logistic regression analysis was used to assess the association between the HBsAg status and pregnancy outcomes. Results This study included 3,789 HBsAg-positive women and 29, 648 non-exposed women. The HBsAg-positive pregnant women were slightly older in age (29.3±4.3 vs. 28.9±4.4, P< 0.001). Additionally, pregnant women with a positive HBsAg status had higher odds of gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM) (adjusted odds ratio [aOR], 1.13; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.03–1.23), and cesarean delivery (aOR, 1.12; 95%CI, 1.03–1.21). The risk of infants being large or small-for-gestational age, having low-birth weight, and of macrosomia, preterm birth, and stillbirth did not differ significantly between the HBsAg-positive and–negative women. Conclusion In Xiamen, China, the slightly higher risk of GDM and cesarean section in women positive for HBsAg should not be neglected. Further studies should be conducted to evaluate the effects of HBsAg positivity on the pregnancy outcomes in different ethnic populations."
https://openalex.org/W3011514994,"While physical frailty and malnutrition/obesity (parameters easily measured by a nurse) are not the same, older persons who are malnourished/obese are more likely to be frail and there is a potential overlap between these conditions. The objective was to examine the relationship between gait speed (GS) and body mass index (BMI) in men and women aged 75 years and older.Cross-sectional analysis.Data from the Aging Multidisciplinary Investigation (AMI), a French prospective cohort study with participants randomly selected from the farmer Health Insurance rolls.Usual GS was measured over a 4 meters-track. BMI was categorized using clinical cut-points for European populations: (e.g, <20.0 kg/m2; 20.0-24.9 kg/m2; 25.0-29.9 kg/m2; 30.0-34.9 kg/m2; ≥35.0 kg/m2).The current analyses were performed in 449 participants. Mean age was 81 years. Being malnourished/obese was significantly associated with slow GS. Unadjusted and age-adjusted models showed that underweight, overweight and obesity statuses were significantly associated with slow GS for both women (0.83m/s [0.61; 1.04], 0.87m/s [0.72; 1.02], 0.70 m/s [0.41; 0.98], respectively) and men (0.83m/s [0.61; 1.04], 1.11m/s [1.03; 1.20], 0.97m/s [0.75; 1.19], respectively).Malnourished/obese are associated with slow GS in older persons. These variables could be contributed at comprehensively and complementarily assessing the older person."
https://openalex.org/W3011149671,"Reliable estimates of biomass and carbon storage are essential for the understanding of the environmental drivers and processes that regulate the productivity of scrub forests. The present study estimated total (above-ground, AGB + below-ground, BGB) biomass and carbon storage of a scrub forest dominated by Avicennia germinans (L.) L. based on the existing allometric models for the AGB, while novel models were developed to estimate the BGB. Data collection followed a destructive approach by using the ""sampling method"", from 45 trees divided into three height classes. Tree height and diameter were used to estimate the BGB of these forests, providing more accurate estimates of their biomass. Our findings indicate the existence of a direct relationship with increasing topography and interstitial salinity, which result in an increase in the percentage contribution of the AGB. By contrast, increasing topography also led to reduction in tree height and contribution of the BGB, although this compartment represents approximately half of the total biomass of these forests. The contribution of BGB estimates increased from 43 to 49.5% from the lowest to the highest height class and the BGB and AGB values reached approximately 87 Mg ha-1 (48.6%) and 91.7 Mg ha-1 (51.4%), respectively. The estimates of the biomass and carbon stocks of scrub mangroves vary considerably worldwide, which reflects the uncertainties derived from the application of distinct sampling methods. Specific models developed for each height class should be considered instead generalist models to reduce the general uncertainties on the production and distribution of biomass and the storage of carbon. Overall, our results overcome a major lacuna in the development of allometric equations to estimate the production of BGB and the storage of carbon by scrub mangrove forests, contributing to the refinement of the total biomass estimates for this type of mangrove forest."
https://openalex.org/W3011761629,"Nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) is the most common liver disease; however, progression to nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) is associated with most adverse outcomes. CYP2B metabolizes multiple xeno- and endobiotics, and male Cyp2b-null mice are diet-induced obese (DIO) with increased NAFLD. However, the DIO study was not performed long enough to assess progression to NASH. Therefore, to assess the role of Cyp2b in fatty liver disease progression from NAFLD to NASH, we treated wildtype (WT) and Cyp2b-null mice with a normal diet (ND) or choline-deficient, L-amino acid-defined high fat diet (CDAHFD) for 8 weeks and determined metabolic and molecular changes. CDAHFD-fed WT female mice gained more weight and had greater liver and white adipose tissue mass than their Cyp2b-null counterparts; males experienced diet-induced weight loss regardless of genotype. Serum biomarkers of liver injury increased in both CDAHFD-fed female and male mice; however CDAHFD-fed Cyp2b-null females exhibited significantly lower serum ALT, AST, and ASP concentrations compared to WT mice, indicating Cyp2b-null females were protected from liver injury. In both genders, hierarchical clustering of RNA-seq data demonstrates several gene ontologies responded differently in CDAHFD-fed Cyp2b-null mice compared to WT mice (lipid metabolism > fibrosis > inflammation). Oil Red O staining and direct triglycerides measurements confirmed that CDAHFD-fed Cyp2b-null females were protected from NAFLD. CDAHFD-fed Cyp2b-null mice showed equivocal changes in fibrosis with transcriptomic and serum markers suggesting less inflammation due to glucocorticoid-mediated repression of immune responses. In contrast to females, CDAHFD-fed Cyp2b-null males had higher triglyceride levels. Results indicate that female Cyp2b-null mice are protected from NAFLD while male Cyp2b-null mice are more susceptible to NAFLD, with few significant changes in NASH development. This study confirms that increased NAFLD development does not necessarily lead to progressive NASH. Furthermore, it indicates a role for Cyp2b in fatty liver disease that differs based on gender."
https://openalex.org/W3009048843,"Schizophrenia poses a significant economic burden on the healthcare system as well as it has a significant impact on society at large. Reasons for such a high economic burden of schizophrenia include the frequent relapses and hospitalizations occurring in this disorder. We analyze the effectiveness of long-acting injectable antipsychotics (LAIs) compared to oral medications, in terms of “clinical process management” in a sample of patients with a diagnosis of schizophrenia spectrum disorder treated in community mental health centers. An observational, retrospective, mirror-image study was carried out to evaluate the effectiveness of LAIs compared to oral medications in terms of number of hospitalizations, emergency visits and planned visits on a 10-year period (from July 2007 to June 2017). Differences between first and second generation LAIs were also explored. Our findings show that hospitalization and emergency visits are significantly decreased with the use of LAIs, while planned visits are increased in patients treated with LAIs. Our results suggest that LAIs, in particular, second generation ones, reduce hospitalization rates and emergency visits, improving the economic burden of schizophrenia. Therefore, LAIs should be considered a cost-effective treatment in the management of schizophrenia under routine conditions."
https://openalex.org/W3012473599,"In porcine kidney auto-transplant models, red blood cells (RBCs) are required for ex-vivo normothermic machine perfusion (NMP). As large quantities of RBCs are needed for NMP, utilising autologous RBCs would imply lethal exsanguination of the pig that is donor and recipient-to-be in the same experiment. The purpose of this study was to determine if an isolated porcine kidney can also be perfused with allogeneic porcine or human RBCs instead. Porcine kidneys, autologous and allogeneic blood were obtained from a local slaughterhouse. Human RBCs (O-pos), were provided by our transfusion laboratory. Warm ischaemia time was standardised at 20 minutes and subsequent hypothermic machine perfusion lasted 1.5–2.5 hours. Next, kidneys underwent NMP at 37°C during 7 hours with Williams' Medium E and washed, leukocyte depleted RBCs of either autologous, allogeneic, or human origin (n = 5 per group). During perfusion all kidneys were functional and produced urine. No macroscopic adverse reactions were observed. Creatinine clearance during NMP was significantly higher in the human RBC group in comparison with the allogeneic group (P = 0.049) but not compared to the autologous group. The concentration of albumin in the urine was significantly higher in the human RBC group (P <0.001) compared to the autologous and allogeneic RBC group. Injury marker aspartate aminotransferase was significantly higher in the human RBC group in comparison with the allogeneic group (P = 0.040) but not in comparison with the autologous group. Renal histology revealed glomerular and tubular damage in all groups. Signs of pathological hyperfiltration and microvascular injury were only observed in the human RBC group. In conclusion, perfusion of porcine kidneys with RBCs of different origin proved technically feasible. However, laboratory analysis and histology revealed more damage in the human RBC group compared to the other two groups. These results indicate that the use of allogeneic RBCs is preferable to human RBCs in a situation where autologous RBCs cannot be used for NMP."
https://openalex.org/W3010963750,"Pneumococcal colonisation is regarded as a pre-requisite for developing pneumococcal disease. In children previous studies have reported pneumococcal colonisation to be a symptomatic event and described a relationship between symptom severity/frequency and colonisation density. The evidence for this in adults is lacking in the literature. This study uses the experimental human pneumococcal challenge (EHPC) model to explore whether pneumococcal colonisation is a symptomatic event in healthy adults.Healthy participants aged 18-50 were recruited and inoculated intra-nasally with either Streptococcus pneumoniae (serotypes 6B, 23F) or saline as a control. Respiratory viral swabs were obtained prior to inoculation. Nasal and non-nasal symptoms were then assessed using a modified Likert score between 1 (no symptoms) to 7 (cannot function). The rate of symptoms reported between the two groups was compared and a correlation analysis performed.Data from 54 participants were analysed. 46 were inoculated with S. pneumoniae (29 with serotype 6B, 17 with serotype 23F) and 8 received saline (control). In total, 14 became experimentally colonised (30.4%), all of which were inoculated with serotype 6B. There was no statistically significant difference in nasal (p = 0.45) or non-nasal symptoms (p = 0.28) between the inoculation group and the control group. In those who were colonised there was no direct correlation between colonisation density and symptom severity. In the 22% (12/52) who were co-colonised, with pneumococcus and respiratory viruses, there was no statistical difference in either nasal or non-nasal symptoms (virus positive p = 0.74 and virus negative p = 1.0).Pneumococcal colonisation using the EHPC model is asymptomatic in healthy adults, regardless of pneumococcal density or viral co-colonisation."
https://openalex.org/W3011252542,"Solar energy technologies have been plagued by their limited visual appeal. Because the electrical power generated by solar panels increases with their surface area and therefore their occupancy of the observer’s visual field, aesthetics will play an increasingly critical role in their future success in urban environments. Inspired by previous psychology research highlighting the aesthetic qualities of fractal patterns, we investigated panel designs featuring fractal electrodes. We conducted behavioral studies which compared observers’ preferences for fractal and conventional bus-bar electrode patterns, along with computer simulations which compared their electrical performances. This led us to develop a hybrid electrode pattern which best combines the fractal and bus-bar designs. Here we show that the new hybrid electrode matches the electrical performance of bus-bars in terms of light transmission and minimizing electrical power losses, while benefiting from the superior aesthetics of fractal patterns. This innovative integration of psychology and engineering studies provides a framework for developing novel electrode patterns with increased implementation and acceptance."
https://openalex.org/W3012061972,"Myotonic dystrophy type 1 (DM1) is an inherited neuromuscular disease which results from an expansion of repetitive DNA elements within the 3' untranslated region of the DMPK gene. Some patients develop multiple pilomatricomas as well as malignant tumors in other tissues. Mutations of the catenin-β gene (CTNNB1) could be demonstrated in most non-syndromic pilomatricomas. In order to gain insight into the molecular mechanisms which might be responsible for the occurrence of multiple pilomatricomas and cancers in patients with DM1, we have sequenced the CTNNB1 gene of four pilomatricomas and of one pilomatrical carcinoma which developed in one patient with molecularly proven DM1 within 4 years. We further analyzed the pilomatrical tumors for microsatellite instability as well as by NGS for mutations in 161 cancer-associated genes. Somatic and independent point-mutations were detected at typical hotspot regions of CTNNB1 (S33C, S33F, G34V, T41I) while one mutation within CTNNB1 represented a duplication mutation (G34dup.). Pilomatricoma samples were analyzed for microsatellite instability and expression of mismatch repair proteins but no mutated microsatellites could be detected and expression of mismatch repair proteins MLH1, MSH2, MSH6, PMS2 was not perturbed. NGS analysis only revealed one heterozygous germline mutation c.8494C>T; p.(Arg2832Cys) within the ataxia telangiectasia mutated gene (ATM) which remained heterozygous in the pilomatrical tumors. The detection of different somatic mutations in different pilomatricomas and in the pilomatrical carcinoma as well as the observation that the patient developed multiple pilomatricomas and one pilomatrical carcinoma over a short time period strongly suggest that the patient displays a hypermutation phenotype. This hypermutability seems to be tissue and gene restricted. Simultaneous transcription of the mutated DMPK gene and the CTNNB1 gene in cycling hair follicles might constitute an explanation for the observed tissue and gene specificity of hypermutability observed in DM1 patients. Elucidation of putative mechanisms responsible for hypermutability in DM1 patients requires further research."

This study aimed to evaluate the species composition of sand flies of four caves, a cave located at Moeda Sul (MS) and three at Parque Estadual Serra do Rola Moça (PESRM), in the region of the Quadrilátero Ferrífero in the state of Minas Gerais, southeastern Brazil. Sand flies were collected with automatic light traps. Non-Metric Multidimensional Scaling, using a dissimilarity matrix calculated with the Jaccard index, and Multivariate Permutation Analysis were used to evaluate sand fly species composition among entrance, interior, and the surrounding environments of each sampled cave and to infer biological mechanisms from patterns of distribution among these different cave environments. A total of 375 phlebotomine sand flies representing 14 species and six genera were collected. The most abundant species were Evandromyia tupynambai (54.7%), Brumptomyia troglodytes (25.6%), Evandromyia edwardsi (6.1%), Psathyromyia brasiliensis (4.8%) and Lutzomyia longipalpis (4.3%). Thirty individuals were collected at MS, 16 inside the cave and 14 from its surroundings. At PESRM, five individuals were collected from the surroundings of cave RM38, 190 individuals from cave RM39 (48 in the cave and 142 from its surroundings) and 150 individuals from cave RM40 (42 in the cave and 108 from its surroundings). The results revealed a rich sand fly fauna with similar species compositions among the entrance, interior, and surrounding environments of each sampled cave, suggesting that both caves and their surroundings are important for maintaining sand fly communities."
https://openalex.org/W3011593916,"Can beautification empower women to act assertively? Some women report that beautification is an agentic and assertive act, whereas others find beautification to be oppressive and disempowering. To disentangle these effects, in the context of romantic attraction we conducted the first experimental tests of beautification-on psychological and behavioral assertiveness. Experiment 1 (N = 145) utilized a between-subjects design in which women used their own clothing, make-up, and accessories to adjust their appearance as they normally would for a ""hot date"" (beautification condition) or a casual day at home with friends (control condition). We measured implicit, explicit, and behavioral assertiveness, as well as positive affect and sexual motivation. Experiment 2 (N = 40) sought to conceptually replicate Experiment 1 using a within-subject design and different measures of assertiveness. Women completed measures of explicit assertiveness and assertive behavioral intentions in three domains, in whatever clothing they were wearing that day then again after extensively beautifying their appearance. In Experiment 1, we found that women demonstrated higher psychological assertiveness after beautifying their appearance, and that high sexual motivation mediated the effect of beautification on assertive behavior. All effects were independent of positive affect. Experiment 2 partially replicated Experiment 1. These experiments provide novel insight into the effects of women's appearance-enhancing behaviors on assertiveness by providing evidence that beautification may positively affect assertiveness in women under some circumstances."
https://openalex.org/W3012449162,"The integrated stress response (ISR) is one of the most important cytoprotective mechanisms and is integrated by phosphorylation of the α subunit of eukaryotic translation initiation factor 2 (eIF2α). Four eIF2α kinases, heme-regulated inhibitor (HRI), double-stranded RNA-dependent protein kinase (PKR), PKR-like endoplasmic reticulum kinase (PERK), and general control nonderepressible 2 (GCN2), are activated in response to several stress conditions. We previously reported that nanosecond pulsed electric fields (nsPEFs) are a potential therapeutic tool for ISR activation. In this study, we examined which eIF2α kinase is activated by nsPEF treatment. To assess the responsible eIF2α kinase, we used previously established eIF2α kinase quadruple knockout (4KO) and single eIF2α kinase-rescued 4KO mouse embryonic fibroblast (MEF) cells. nsPEFs 70 ns in duration with 30 kV/cm electric fields caused eIF2α phosphorylation in wild-type (WT) MEF cells. On the other hand, nsPEF-induced eIF2α phosphorylation was completely abolished in 4KO MEF cells and was recovered by HRI overexpression. CM-H2DCFDA staining showed that nsPEFs generated reactive oxygen species (ROS), which activated HRI. nsPEF-induced eIF2α phosphorylation was blocked by treatment with the ROS scavenger N-acetyl-L-cysteine (NAC). Our results indicate that the eIF2α kinase HRI is responsible for nsPEF-induced ISR activation and is activated by nsPEF-generated ROS."
https://openalex.org/W3010731303,"Background In September 2017, the Hurricane Irma devastated the islands of Saint-Martin and Saint-Barthelemy (French West Indies). This was a particularly distressing time for the local healthcare staff in charge of rescuing the population. The aim of this study was to identify the explanatory factors of post-traumatic distress and burnout in hospital staff. Methods An anonymous questionnaire was sent to all 509 hospital workers of Saint-Martin and Saint-Barthelemy. Post-traumatic distress and burnout was assessed using the Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder Checklist (PCL-S) and Copenhagen Burnout Inventory (CBI) scales. Bivariate and multivariate analyses were used to determine the explanatory variables for these two psychological disorders. Results Two hundred and sixty-two questionnaires were completed (response rate of 51.7%). The explanatory factors of post-traumatic distress were female gender (OR = 12.93, 95% CI: 2.70–232.10), electricity shortages (OR = 2.92, 95% CI: 1.13–8.19) and home damage (OR = 1.16, 95% CI [1.02–1.33]). In parallel, the explanatory factors of burnout were post-traumatic distress (OR: 10.42, 95% CI: 4.72–25.58), female gender (OR = 2,41, 95% CI: 1.24–5.02) and paramedical staff (OR = 2,53, 95% CI: 1.15–6.21). In the multivariate analysis, only burnout was significantly associated with post-traumatic distress (OR = 9.26, 95% CI: 4.11–23.14). Conclusions Six months after Irma, post-traumatic distress among hospital staff was strongly linked to burnout. This study revealed the lack of electricity as a new factor related to post-traumatic distress. It also suggested that psychological intervention should be strengthened."
https://openalex.org/W3011227882,"Background Hand injuries (HI) are common and may limit participation in work. The objective of this study is to examine the effect of ethnicity and other prognostic variables on return-to-work (RTW) among male manual workers after acute HI. Methods A cohort of 178 subjects (90 Arabs, 88 Jews) aged 22 to 65 was studied. Trained bilingual occupational therapists evaluated and interviewed the subjects, using structured validated questionnaires for evaluating personal and environmental factors, body function and structure, and activity limitation and participation restrictions. Employment status 3 months post injury was assessed by a telephone interview. To establish a predictive model for RTW, ethnicity and certain variables of the four domains mentioned above were analyzed using logistic regression analysis. Results A significant difference in the rate of RTW between Jews and Arabs was found (45.5% for Jews, 28.9% for Arabs, p = 0.03) three months post HI. In the univariate regression analysis, ethnicity was associated with RTW (OR = 2.05; CI: 1.10–3.81) for Jews vs. Arabs. Using a multivariate analysis, only legal counseling, educational attainment, and the severity of disability were significantly associated with RTW. Conclusion RTW three months post HI among manual workers is directly related to variables such as education and legal counseling and only indirectly related to ethnicity. Patients with a lower level of education and those who were engaged in legal counseling need special attention and close guidance in the process of RTW."
https://openalex.org/W3011493354,"The Ngorongoro Crater is an intact caldera with an area of approximately 310 km2 located within the Ngorongoro Conservation Area (NCA) in northern Tanzania. It is known for the abundance and diversity of its wildlife and is a UNESCO World Heritage Site and an International Biosphere Reserve. Long term records (1963–2012) on herbivore populations, vegetation and rainfall made it possible to analyze historic and project future herbivore population dynamics. NCA was established as a multiple use area in 1959. In 1974 there was a perturbation in that resident Maasai and their livestock were removed from the Ngorongoro Crater. Thus, their pasture management that was a combination of livestock grazing and fire was also removed and 'burning' stopped being a regular occurrence until it was resumed in 2001 by NCA management. The Maasai pasture management would have selected for shorter grasses and more palatable species. Vegetation mapping in 1966–1967 recorded predominately short grasslands. Subsequent vegetation mapping in the crater in 1995 determined that the grassland structure had changed such that mid and tall grasses were dominant. After removal of the Maasai pastoralists from the Ngorongoro Crater in 1974, there were significant changes in population trends for some herbivore species. Buffalo, elephant and ostrich numbers increased significantly during 1974–2012. The zebra population was stable from 1963 to 2012 whereas population numbers of five species declined substantially between 1974 and 2012 relative to their peak numbers during 1974–1976. Grant’s and Thomson’s gazelles, eland, kongoni, and waterbuck (wet season only) declined significantly in the Crater in both seasons after 1974. In addition, some herbivore species were consistently more abundant inside the Crater during the wet than the dry season. This pattern was most evident for the large herbivore species requiring bulk forage, i.e., buffalo, eland, and elephant. Even with a change in grassland structure, total herbivore biomass remained relatively stable from 1963 to 2012, implying that the crater has a stable carrying capacity. Analyses of rainfall indicated that there was a persistent cycle of 4.83 years for the annual component. Herbivore population size was correlated with rainfall in both the wet and dry seasons. The relationships established between the time series of historic animal counts in the wet and dry seasons and lagged wet and dry season rainfall series were used to forecast the likely future trajectories of the wet and dry season population size for each species under three alternative climate change scenarios."
https://openalex.org/W3012128677,"Objective This study was done to determine the validity of amsler grid test black on white (BOW), as well as white on black (WOB) for identifying central visual field (VF) defects in patients with advanced glaucoma. Design Prospective study. Participants We prospectively included 100 consecutive eyes of 88 adult patients with advanced glaucoma and 100 eyes of 100 normal individuals. We used a lottery method to choose the side of the eye for the control groups. Methods All participants had reliable Humphrey 10–2 Swedish Interactive Threshold Algorithm (SITA) standard VF. Both the BOW and WOB amsler grid tests were done for each group. Sensitivity, specificity, and positive and negative predictive values of the amsler grid scotoma area were calculated with the 10–2 VF as the reference standard. Results The mean ± standard deviation (SD) of age and the 10–2 VF mean deviation (MD) of advanced glaucoma eyes were 59.8 ± 11.8 (range 34–84) years and -19.94 ± 9.8(range -34.98–-0.52) respectively. Among 108 eyes with normal 10–2 VF test, 103 had a normal BOW amsler grid test and 5 had an abnormal BOW test. Among 92 eyes with an abnormal 10–2 VF test, 74 had an abnormal and 18 had normal BOW amsler grid test. Sensitivity, specificity, and positive and negative predictive values of the BOW amsler grid test were 80.4%, 95.4%, 93% and 85.1% respectively whereas that of the WOB amsler grid test were 71.7%, 95.4%, 93% and 72.8% respectively. Conclusion The sensitivity and specificity of both BOW and WOB amsler grid tests were high in detecting VF defects in advanced glaucoma."
https://openalex.org/W3012421177,"Professional wellness is critical to developing and maintaining a health care workforce. Previous work has identified burnout as a significant challenge to professional wellness facing emergency medical technicians (EMTs) in many countries worldwide. Our study fills a critical gap by assessing the prevalence of burnout among emergency medical technicians (EMTs) in India.This was a cross-sectional survey of EMTs within the largest prehospital care organization in India. We used the Maslach Burnout Inventory (MBI) to measure wellness. All EMTs presenting for continuing medical education between July-November 2017 from the states of Gujarat, Karnataka, and Telangana were eligible. Trained, independent staff administered anonymous MBI-Medical Personnel Surveys in local languages.Of the 327 EMTs eligible, 314 (96%) consented to participate, and 296 (94%) surveys were scorable. The prevalence of burnout was 28.7%. Compared to EMTs in other countries, Indian EMTs had higher levels of personal accomplishment but also higher levels of emotional exhaustion and moderate levels of depersonalization. In multivariate regression, determinants of burnout included younger age, perceived lack of respect from colleagues and administrators, and a sense of physical risk. EMTs who experienced burnout were four times as likely to plan to quit their jobs within one year.This is the first assessment of burnout in EMTs in India and adds to the limited body of literature among low- and middle-income country (LMIC) prehospital providers worldwide. Burnout was strongly associated with an EMT's intention to quit within a year, with potential implications for employee turnover and healthcare workforce shortages. Burnout should be a key focus of further study and possible intervention to achieve internationally recognized targets, including Sustainable Development Goal 3C and WHO's 2030 Milestone for Human Resources."
https://openalex.org/W3010643662,"This paper provides empirical evidence that individuals substantially revise their stated wealth redistribution preferences after fiscal scandals. The 2016 Panama Papers scandal revealed top-income tax evasion behaviour simultaneously worldwide. The empirical investigation exploits this event as a quasi-natural experiment. I rely on two original datasets, a UK household longitudinal dataset and a survey conducted in 22 European countries. I use a difference-in-differences strategy and find that pro-redistribution statements increased between 2% and 3.3% after the scandal. Responses are heterogeneous and larger for right-wing individuals and low-income individuals. This change in wealth redistribution preferences is likely to have been translated into a slight change in votes. The results suggest an increase in stated voting intentions for the left and a decrease for the right. Complementary estimations reveal that more media coverage and more individuals involved by country increase the magnitude of the response."
https://openalex.org/W3010700480,"The eye and mouth regions serve as the primary sources of facial information regarding an individual's emotional state. The aim of this study was to provide a comprehensive assessment of the relative importance of those two information sources in the identification of different emotions. The stimuli were composite facial images, in which different expressions (Neutral, Anger, Disgust, Fear, Happiness, Contempt, and Surprise) were presented in the eyes and the mouth. Participants (21 women, 11 men, mean age 25 years) rated the expressions of 7 congruent and 42 incongruent composite faces by clicking on a point within the valence-arousal emotion space. Eye movements were also monitored. With most incongruent composite images, the perceived emotion corresponded to the expression of either the eye region or the mouth region or an average of those. The happy expression was different. Happy eyes often shifted the perceived emotion towards a slightly negative point in the valence-arousal space, not towards the location associated with a congruent happy expression. The eye-tracking data revealed significant effects of congruency, expressions and interaction on total dwell time. Our data indicate that whether a face that combines features from two emotional expressions leads to a percept based on only one of the expressions (categorical perception) or integration of the two expressions (dimensional perception), or something altogether different, strongly depends upon the expressions involved."
https://openalex.org/W3010994754,"We aimed to construct a better model for predicting treatment outcomes of anti-vascular endothelial growth factor therapy for neovascular age-related macular degeneration (nAMD) using the concentrations of aqueous humour proteins at baseline and during treatment. From the data of 48 treatment-naïve nAMD eyes that received intravitreal ranibizumab pro re nata for up to 12 months, we used the aqueous humour concentrations of C-X-C motif chemokine ligand 1 (CXCL1), CXCL12, CXCL13, interferon-γ-induced protein 10, monocyte chemoattractant protein 1 (MCP-1), C-C motif chemokine ligand 11, interleukin 6 (IL-6), IL-10, and matrix metalloproteinase 9 (MMP-9). After stepwise regression, multivariate analysis was performed to identify which predictors were significantly associated with best-corrected visual acuity (BCVA) changes and the number of injections. The results demonstrated that besides male sex (β coefficient = -0.088, P = 0.040) and central retinal thickness (β coefficient = 0.00051 per μm, P = 0.027), MCP-1 (β coefficient = 0.44, P < 0.001) and IL-10 (β coefficient = -0.16, P = 0.033) were significantly correlated with baseline BCVA. Additionally, high MCP-1 at baseline (β coefficient = -0.20, P = 0.015) and low CXCL13 at baseline (β coefficient = 0.10, P = 0.0054) were independently associated with better BCVA change at 12 months. High MMP-9 at the first injection (β coefficient = 0.56, P = 0.01), CXCL12 at the third injection (β coefficient = 0.10, P = 0.0002), and IL-10 at the third injection (β coefficient = 1.3, P = 0.001) were predictor variables associated with the increased number of injections. In conclusion, aqueous humour protein concentrations may have predictive abilities of BCVA change over 12 months and the number of injections in pro re nata treatment of exudative nAMD."
https://openalex.org/W3011526046,"The V-antigen, a virulence-associated protein, was first identified in Yersinia pestis more than half a century ago. Since then, other V-antigen homologs and orthologs have been discovered and are now considered as critical molecules for the toxic effects mediated by the type III secretion system during infections caused by various pathogenic Gram-negative bacteria. After purifying recombinant V-antigen proteins, including PcrV from Pseudomonas aeruginosa, LcrV from Yersinia, LssV from Photorhabdus luminescens, AcrV from Aeromonas salmonicida, and VcrV from Vibrio parahaemolyticus, we developed an enzyme-linked immunoabsorbent assay to measure titers against each V-antigen in sera collected from 186 adult volunteers. Different titer-specific correlation levels were determined for the five V-antigens. The anti-LcrV and anti-AcrV titers shared the highest correlation with each other with a correlation coefficient of 0.84. The next highest correlation coefficient was between anti-AcrV and anti-VcrV titers at 0.79, while the lowest correlation was found between anti-LcrV and anti-VcrV titers, which were still higher than 0.7. Sera from mice immunized with one of the five recombinant V-antigens displayed cross-antigenicity with some of the other four V-antigens, supporting the results from the human sera. Thus, the serum anti-V-antigen titer measurement system may be used for epidemiological investigations of various pathogenic Gram-negative bacteria."
https://openalex.org/W3011610295,"Objective To investigate the impact of metabolic syndrome and its components on osteoarthritis of the hip joints compared to a healthy cohort in the KORA MRI-study. Methods Randomly selected men and women from the general population were classified as having metabolic syndrome, defined as presence of central obesity plus two of the following four components: elevated blood pressure (BP), elevated fasting glucose, elevated triglycerides (TG) and low HDL-cholesterol (HDL-c), or as controls without metabolic syndrome. Therefore, each subject underwent detailed assessment of waist circumference as well as fasting glucose, systolic and diastolic BP, TG, and HDL-c concentrations as well as a full-body MR scan. MR measurements were performed on a 3 Tesla scanner (Magnetom Skyra, Siemens) including a dual-echo Dixon and a T2 SS-FSE sequence for anatomical structures. In order to quantify osteoarthritis of the hip, assessment was performed by two independent, experienced radiologists for joint gap narrowing, osteophytic lipping and subchondral changes (e.g. sclerosis, pseudocysts). Associations between metabolic syndrome components and hip degeneration were estimated by logistic regression models providing odds ratios. Results Among 354 included participants (mean age: 56.1 ± 9.2 years; 55.4% male), 119 (34%) had metabolic syndrome, while 235 (66%) were part of the control group. Except for elevated blood glucose (p = 0.02), none of the metabolic syndromes’ component was independently associated with osteoarthritis. Multivariable adjusted ORs for osteoarthritis of the right hip were 1.00 (95% CI 0.98;1.03), 1.00 (95% CI 0.99;1.00), 1.01 (95% CI 0.99;1.03), 1.00 (95% CI 0.97;1.04) and 1.01 (95% CI 0.96;1.06), and for the left hip 1.00 (95% CI 0.98;1.03), 1.00 (95% CI 1.00;1.01), 1.01 (95% CI 0.99;1.03), 0.99 (95% CI 0.96;1.02) and 1.04 (95% CI 0.99;1.09) for waist circumference, triglyceride, HDL-c and systolic and diastolic BP, respectively. Blood glucose was a borderline non-dependent factor for osteoarthritis of the right hip (OR: 1.02 (95% CI 1.0;1.04); p = 0.05). Furthermore, the compound metabolic syndrome was not significantly associated (OR left hip: 1.53 (95% CI 0.8;2.92), p = 0.20; OR right hip: 1.33 (95% CI 0.72;2.45), p = 0.37) with osteoarthritis of the hip joint. Age as well as gender (left hip) were the only parameters in univariate and multivariate analysis to be significantly associated with osteoarthritis of the hip joint. Conclusion The compound metabolic syndrome showed no association with osteoarthritis of the hip joint. Age was the only parameter to be dependently and independently associated to osteoarthritis of both hip joints, while elevated blood glucose was independently associated with degeneration of the right hip joint."
https://openalex.org/W3011869022,"The risk of many complex diseases is determined by a complex interplay of genetic and environmental factors. Advanced next generation sequencing technology makes identification of gene-environment (GE) interactions for both common and rare variants possible. However, most existing methods focus on testing the main effects of common and/or rare genetic variants. There are limited methods developed to test the effects of GE interactions for rare variants only or rare and common variants simultaneously. In this study, we develop novel approaches to test the effects of GE interactions of rare and/or common risk, and/or protective variants in sequencing association studies. We propose two approaches: 1) testing the effects of an optimally weighted combination of GE interactions for rare variants (TOW-GE); 2) testing the effects of a weighted combination of GE interactions for both rare and common variants (variable weight TOW-GE, VW-TOW-GE). Extensive simulation studies based on the Genetic Analysis Workshop 17 data show that the type I error rates of the proposed methods are well controlled. Compared to the existing interaction sequence kernel association test (ISKAT), TOW-GE is more powerful when there are GE interactions’ effects for rare risk and/or protective variants; VW-TOW-GE is more powerful when there are GE interactions’ effects for both rare and common risk and protective variants. Both TOW-GE and VW-TOW-GE are robust to the directions of effects of causal GE interactions. We demonstrate the applications of TOW-GE and VW-TOW-GE using an imputed data from the COPDGene Study."
https://openalex.org/W3010836846,"Human respirovirus type 3 (HRV3) is a leading etiology of lower respiratory tract infections in young children and ranks only second to the human respiratory syncytial virus (HRSV). Despite the public health importance of HRV3, there is limited information about the genetic characteristics and diversity of these viruses in Kenya. To begin to address this gap, we analyzed 35 complete hemagglutinin-neuraminidase (HN) sequences of HRV3 strains isolated in Kenya between 2010 and 2013. Viral RNA was extracted from the isolates, and the entire HN gene amplified by RT-PCR followed by nucleotide sequencing. Phylogenetic analyses of the sequences revealed that all the Kenyan isolates grouped into genetic Cluster C; sub-clusters C1a, C2, and C3a. The majority (54%) of isolates belonged to sub-cluster C3a, followed by C2 (43%) and C1a (2.9%). Sequence analysis revealed high identities between the Kenyan isolates and the HRV3 prototype strain both at the amino acid (96.5-97.9%) and nucleotide (94.3-95.6%) levels. No amino acid variations affecting the catalytic/active sites of the HN glycoprotein were observed among the Kenyan isolates. Selection pressure analyses showed that the HN glycoprotein was evolving under positive selection. Evolutionary analyses revealed that the mean TMRCA for the HN sequence dataset was 1942 (95% HPD: 1928-1957), while the mean evolutionary rate was 4.65x10-4 nucleotide substitutions/site/year (95% HPD: 2.99x10-4 to 6.35x10-4). Overall, our results demonstrate the co-circulation of strains of cluster C HRV3 variants in Kenya during the study period. This is the first study to describe the genetic and molecular evolutionary aspects of HRV3 in Kenya using the complete HN gene."
https://openalex.org/W3010884969,"We have previously shown that changes in the microbiome influence how the healing tendon responds to different treatments. The aim of this study was to investigate if changes in the microbiome influence the response to mechanical loading during tendon healing. 90 Sprague-Dawley rats were used. Specific Opportunist and Pathogen Free (SOPF) rats were co-housed with Specific Pathogen Free (SPF) rats, carrying Staphylococcus aureus and other opportunistic microbes. After 6 weeks of co-housing, the SOPF rats were contaminated which was confirmed by Staphylococcus aureus growth. Clean SOPF rats were used as controls. The rats were randomized to full loading or partial unloading by Botox injections in their calf muscles followed by complete Achilles tendon transection. Eight days later, the healing tendons were tested mechanically. The results were analysed by a 2-way ANOVA with interaction between loading and contamination on peak force as the primary outcome and there was an interaction for both peak force (p = 0.049) and stiffness (p = 0.033). Furthermore, partial unloading had a profound effect on most outcome variables. In conclusion, the response to mechanical loading during tendon healing is influenced by changes in the microbiome. Studies aiming for clinical relevance should therefore consider the microbiome of laboratory animals."
https://openalex.org/W3010929695,"MPV17 is described as a mitochondrial inner membrane channel. Although its function remains elusive, mutations in the MPV17 gene result in hepato-cerebral mitochondrial DNA depletion syndrome in humans. In this study, we show that MPV17 silencing does not induce depletion in mitochondrial DNA content in cancer cells. We also show that MPV17 does not control cancer cell proliferation despite the fact that we initially observed a reduced proliferation rate in five MPV17-silenced cancer cell lines with two different shRNAs. However, shRNA-mediated MPV17 knockdown performed in this work provided misguiding results regarding the resulting proliferation phenotype and only a rescue experiment was able to shed definitive light on the implication of MPV17 in cancer cell proliferation. Our results therefore emphasize the caution that is required when scientific conclusions are drawn from a work based on lentiviral vector-based gene silencing and clearly demonstrate the need to systematically perform a rescue experiment in order to ascertain the specific nature of the experimental results."
https://openalex.org/W3011857510,"Inflammatory bowel diseases (IBD) are complex, multifactorial disorders characterized by chronic relapsing intestinal inflammation. IBD is diagnosed around 1 in 1000 individuals in Western countries with globally increasing incident rates. Association studies have identified hundreds of genes that are linked to IBD and potentially regulate its pathology. The further dissection of the genetic network underlining IBD pathogenesis and pathophysiology is hindered by the limited capacity to functionally characterize each genetic association, including generating knockout animal models for every associated gene. Cutting-edge CRISPR/Cas9-based technology may transform the field of IBD research by efficiently and effectively introducing genetic alterations. In the present study, we used CRISPR/Cas9-based technologies to genetically modify hematopoietic stem cells. Through cell sorting and bone marrow transplantation, we established a system to knock out target gene expression by over 90% in the immune system of reconstituted animals. Using a CD40-mediated colitis model, we further validated our CRISPR/Cas9-based platform for investigating gene function in experimental IBD. In doing so, we developed a model system that delivers genetically modified mice in a manner much faster than conventional methodology, significantly reducing the time from target identification to in vivo target validation and expediting drug development."

We aimed to investigate the occurrence, consequence and associated factors of MV reinstitution. Methods We analyzed the clinical data and physiological measurements of tracheostomized patients with prolonged MV discharged from the weaning unit to general wards after successful weaning to compare between those with and without in-hospital MV reinstitution within 60 days. Results Of 454 patients successfully weaned, 116 (25.6%) reinstituted MV at general wards within 60 days; at hospital discharge, 42 (36.2%) of them were eventually liberated from MV, 51 (44.0%) remained MV dependent, and 33 (28.4%) died. Of the 338 patients without reinstitution within 60 days, only 3 (0.9%) were later reinstituted with MV before discharge (on day 67, 89 and 136 at general wards, respectively), and 322 (95.2%) were successfully weaned again at discharge, while 13 (3.8%) died. Patients with MV reinstitution had a significantly lower level of maximal expiratory pressure (PEmax) before unassisted breathing trial compared to those without reinstitution. Multivariable Cox regression analysis showed fever at RCC discharge (hazard ratio [HR] 14.00, 95% confidence interval [CI] 3.2–61.9) chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (HR 2.37, 95% CI 1.34–4.18), renal replacement therapy at the ICU (HR 2.29, 95% CI 1.50–3.49) and extubation failure before tracheostomy (HR 1.76, 95% CI 1.18–2.63) were associated with increased risks of reinstitution, while PEmax > 30 cmH2O (HR 0.51, 95% CI 0.35–0.76) was associated with a decreased risk of reinstitution. Conclusions The reinstitution of MV at the general ward is significant, with poor outcomes. The PEmax measured before unassisted breathing trial was significantly associated with the risk of reinstituting MV at the general wards."

These sequences were generated by the NIC or the WHO Collaborating Center (CC) at the U.S Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, uploaded to the Global Initiative on Sharing All Influenza Data (GISAID) platform, and used for phylogenetic reconstruction.Influenza hemagglutinin sequences from the participating countries (A/H1pdm09 n = 326, A/H3 n = 636, B n = 433) were highly concordant with the genetic groups of the influenza vaccine-recommended viruses for influenza A/H1pdm09 and influenza B. For influenza A/H3, the concordance was variable.Considering the constant evolution of influenza viruses, high-quality surveillance data-specifically genetic sequence data, are important to allow public health decision makers to make informed decisions about prevention and control strategies, such as influenza vaccine composition. Countries that conduct influenza genetic sequencing for surveillance in LA should continue to work with the WHO CCs to produce high-quality genetic sequence data and upload those sequences to open-access databases."
https://openalex.org/W3012202266,"Sepsis-induced cardiomyopathy (SIC) is known to show cardiac dysfunction in patients with sepsis. Both a decrease or an increase in ejection fraction (EF), an indicator of cardiac function, can occur. The purpose of this study was to identify factors associated with abnormal left ventricular (LV) function measured by EF in patients with sepsis in the intensive care unit (ICU).This was a retrospective study performed from November 2016 to December 2018. Three-hundred and sixty-six patients (mean age, 73 ± 13 years; 191 [52%] men) admitted to the ICU with sepsis were included. Patients were classified into three categories according to LV EF (group 1 -[EF<50%, n = 36], group 2 -[50≤EF<70%, n = 252], and group 3 -[EF≥70%, n = 78]). Echocardiographic assessment was performed within 48 hours of diagnosis of sepsis. We analyzed clinical factors including mortality, echocardiographic findings, and laboratory parameters.Decreased LV EF occurred in 36 (10%) patients and hyper-dynamic EF developed in 78 (21%) patients. Of 366 patients, 103 (28%) patients died. Baseline characteristics were similar in the three groups, except female sex an indicator of abnormal EF. Mortality rates were also similar in the three groups; however, mortality rates were significantly higher in patients with abnormal EF (decreased or increased vs. normal). Echocardiographic parameters were significantly different in the three groups, in terms of LV systolic parameters and chamber size. Small left atrium (LA) and small LV were significantly associated with abnormal EF (especially in patients with increased EF). High brain natriuretic peptide was associated with decreased EF. Among these factors, female sex and small LA were significantly associated with abnormal EF in the multiple regression analysis.Our findings highlight that female sex and small cardiac size are associated with abnormal EF, and therefore, death. Therefore, female patients and patients with small LA should be monitored closely when they present with sepsis."
https://openalex.org/W3012503884,"The heterogeneous melting kinetics of polycrystalline aluminum is investigated by a theoretical model which represents the overall melting rate as a functional of the Weibull grain-size-distribution. It is found that the melting process is strongly affected by the mean-grain-diameter, but is insensitive to the shape parameter of the Weibull distribution. The temperature-time-transformation (TTT) diagrams are calculated to probe dependence of the characteristic timescale of melting on the overheating temperature and the mean-grain-diameter. The model predicts that the heterogeneous melting time of polycrystalline aluminum exponentially depends on temperature in high temperature range and the exponent constant is an intrinsic material constant independent of the mean-grain-diameter. Comparisons between TTT diagrams of heterogeneous melting and homogenous melting are also provided."
https://openalex.org/W3010901136,"Cyclo-Gly-Pro (CGP) attenuates nociception, however its effects on salivary glands remain unclear. In this study, we investigated the acute effects of CGP on salivary flow and composition, and on the submandibular gland composition, compared with morphine. Besides, we characterized the effects of naloxone (a non-selective opioid receptor antagonist) on CGP- and morphine-induced salivary and glandular alterations in mice. After that, in silico analyses were performed to predict the interaction between CGP and opioid receptors. Morphine and CGP significantly reduced salivary flow and total protein concentration of saliva and naloxone restored them to the physiological levels. Morphine and CGP also reduced several infrared vibrational modes (Amide I, 1687-1594cm-1; Amide II, 1594-1494cm-1; CH2/CH3, 1488-1433cm-1; C = O, 1432-1365cm-1; PO2 asymmetric, 1290-1185cm-1; PO2 symmetric, 1135-999cm-1) and naloxone reverted these alterations. The in silico docking analysis demonstrated the interaction of polar contacts between the CGP and opioid receptor Cys219 residue. Altogether, we showed that salivary hypofunction and glandular changes elicited by CGP may occur through opioid receptor suggesting that the blockage of opioid receptors in superior cervical and submandibular ganglions may be a possible strategy to restore salivary secretion while maintaining antinociceptive action due its effects on the central nervous system."
https://openalex.org/W3011079071,"The goal of the present study was to investigate the causal direction of influence between the ingroup as a whole and the self or another ingroup member considering a key feature of groups, i.e., their perceived meaningfulness. To this goal, in Study 1, 2, and 3 we predicted a preference for self-stereotyping and ingroup-stereotyping in the meaningful social categories of sorority women, left-handed people and psychology students. In Study 4 we further expect that the meaningfulness attributed to a group moderates the direction of causality between individual and ingroup perception. Thus, we used one's Zodiac sign as the ingroup whose degree of meaningfulness varies across participants and we hypothesized higher levels of meaningfulness attributed to the ingroup to be associated with higher self- and ingroup-stereotyping. Using the methodologically stringent Induction Deduction Paradigm, participants were given information on unfamiliar dimensions, about either the ingroup or an individual (self or other ingroup member) and asked to make inferences on those same attributes about the ingroup (induction condition) or the individual (deduction condition). As predicted, a preference for deduction to the self (i.e., self-stereotyping) and deduction to another ingroup member (i.e., ingroup-stereotyping) were found for the meaningful groups of sorority women, left-handed people, and Psychology students (Studies 1, 2, and 3). In Study 4, consistent with predictions, the higher the level of attributed meaningfulness to the Zodiac system the higher the degree of deduction both to the self (self-stereotyping) and to another Zodiac ingroup member (ingroup-stereotyping). Several implications of these results are discussed, for example in relation to the possibility of educational interventions aimed at invalidating intergroup differences."
https://openalex.org/W3011824779,"Resource distribution networks are the infrastructure facilitating the flow of resources in both biotic and abiotic systems. Both theoretical and empirical arguments have proposed that physical systems self-organise to maximise power production, but how this trajectory is related to network development, especially regarding the heterogeneity of resource distribution in explicitly spatial networks, is less understood. Quantifying the heterogeneity of resource distribution is necessary for understanding how phenomena such as economic inequality or energetic niches emerge across socio-ecological and environmental systems. Although qualitative discussions have been put forward on this topic, to date there has not been a quantitative analysis of the relationship between network development, maximum power, and inequality. This paper introduces a theoretical framework and applies it to simulate the power consumption and inequality in generalised, spatially explicit resource distribution networks. The networks illustrate how increasing resource flows amplify inequality in power consumption at network end points, due to the spatial heterogeneity of the distribution architecture. As increasing resource flows and the development of hierarchical branching can both be strategies for increasing power consumption, this raises important questions about the different outcomes of heterogeneous distribution in natural versus human-engineered networks, and how to prioritise equity of distribution in the latter."
https://openalex.org/W3012402194,"The northeastern region of Argentina has the highest age-adjusted cervical cancer mortality rates. Given the strong link between HPV infections and cervical cancer, one of the main interventions is the population-based use of HPV vaccines. However, the acceptability is not very clear in low- and middle-income countries. The purpose of this study was to estimate the level of HPV vaccine acceptance and associated determinants among caregivers of girls in a northeastern city of Argentina.A school-based survey was conducted in 2015 using a multistage sampling method. The primary sample unit were schools stratified by socioeconomic status selected at random, and caregivers of school girls were interviewed. The acceptability was determined using the adapted Theory of Planned Behavior. We performed logistic regression models to assess associated determinants.The study included 347 caregivers. The intention to vaccinate was 59.88%. A positive attitude of caregivers (aOR 4.67; 3.11-7.03) and positive influence of social norms (aOR 1.95; 1.03-3.70) were the main predictors independently associated to the intention to vaccinate against HPV. In contrast, practicing a Christian non-Catholic religion decreased the intention to vaccinate against HPV (OR 0.59; 0.36-0.95). All other factors evaluated were not significantly associated with intention to vaccinate against HPV.This study shows that evaluating attitudes, normative social beliefs, and perceived self-efficacy regarding HPV vaccination can be of utmost importance for mapping and planning of health-related strategies in developing countries."
https://openalex.org/W3010164818,"Background The Capital Card, developed by WDP, is a digital innovation which acts as a form of contingency management, and aims to significantly improve service user outcomes. WDP is a substance misuse treatment provider commissioned by local authorities across the UK to support service users and their families affected by addiction. The Capital Card, much like commercial loyalty cards, uses a simple earn-spend points system which incentivises and rewards service users for engaging with services e.g. by attending key work sessions, Blood Borne Virus appointments or group-work sessions. The Spend activities available to service users are designed to improve overall wellbeing and build social and recovery capital, and include activities such as educational classes, fitness classes, driving lessons, and cinema tickets. Methods and findings We compared successful completion rates of 1,545 service users accessing one of WDP’s London based community services over a two-year period; before and after the Capital Card was introduced. Client demographics (age, sex and primary substance) were controlled for during the analysis. Once client demographics were controlled for, analysis showed that clients with a Capital Card were 1.5 times more likely to successfully complete treatment than those who had not had the Capital Card (OR = 1.507, 95% CI = 1.194 to 1.902). Conclusions The results of this initial evaluation are of particular interest to commissioners and policy makers as it indicates that the Capital Card can be used effectively as a form of contingency management to enhance recovery outcomes for service users engaging in community-based substance misuse services."
https://openalex.org/W3011329182,"This paper describes CarbMetSim, a discrete-event simulator that tracks the blood glucose level of a person in response to a timed sequence of diet and exercise activities. CarbMetSim implements broader aspects of carbohydrate metabolism in human beings with the objective of capturing the average impact of various diet/exercise activities on the blood glucose level. Key organs (stomach, intestine, portal vein, liver, kidney, muscles, adipose tissue, brain and heart) are implemented to the extent necessary to capture their impact on the production and consumption of glucose. Key metabolic pathways (glucose oxidation, glycolysis and gluconeogenesis) are accounted for in the operation of different organs. The impact of insulin and insulin resistance on the operation of various organs and pathways is captured in accordance with published research. CarbMetSim provides broad flexibility to configure the insulin production ability, the average flux along various metabolic pathways and the impact of insulin resistance on different aspects of carbohydrate metabolism. The simulator does not yet have a detailed implementation of protein and lipid metabolism. This paper contains a preliminary validation of the simulator’s behavior. Significant additional validation is required before the simulator can be considered ready for use by people with Diabetes."
https://openalex.org/W3010702355,"The use of transcatheter or surgical aortic valve replacement (AVR) for severe aortic stenosis (AS) has considerably increased in recent years. However, the association between AS etiology and mid-term clinical outcomes after surgical AVR has not been fully investigated.We retrospectively included 201 patients (mean age, 75 years; 43%, men) who underwent surgical AVR for severe native AS (aortic valve area ≤1.0 cm2 on preoperative transthoracic echocardiography examination). The following valve etiologies were postoperatively identified on pathological examination: post-inflammatory (n = 28), congenital (n = 35), and calcific/degenerative (n = 138). The median follow-up interval was 4.1 years following surgical AVR. Of the 201 patients, 27% were asymptomatic, 40% had a history of heart failure, and 11% underwent previous heart surgery. The cumulative incidence of cardiac events (all-cause death, aortic valve deterioration requiring repeated AVR, and hospitalization for heart failure) and combined adverse events, which included non-fatal stroke, unplanned coronary revascularization, pacemaker implantation, and gastrointestinal bleeding along with cardiac events, was significantly higher in the calcific/degenerative group (p = 0.02 and p = 0.02, respectively). In multivariate analysis adjusted for age, sex, renal function, heart failure, atrial fibrillation, concomitant surgical procedures, and EuroSCORE II, AS etiology was independently associated with an increased risk of combined adverse events (congenital vs. post-inflammatory: hazard ratio [HR], 4.13; p = 0.02 and calcific/degenerative vs. post-inflammatory: HR, 5.69; p = 0.002).Pathology-proven AS etiology could aid in predicting the mid-term outcomes after surgical AVR, supporting the importance of accurate identification of severe AS etiology with or without postoperative pathological examination."
https://openalex.org/W3011826956,"Enhancing the self-management activities of patients improves the quality of care and is an integrated element of current healthcare provision. However, self-management support (SMS) is not yet common in healthcare. The Primary Care Resources and Support for Self-Management (PCRS) is a tool for healthcare professionals to assess the quality of SMS. In this study, we assessed the validity and reliability of the Dutch version of the PCRS.The validation of the PCRS was performed in Dutch healthcare centres. Correlations between the PCRS scores and the Assessment of Chronic Illness Care (ACIC) and Clinician Support for Patient Activation Measure (CS-PAM) scores were calculated to assess the convergent and discriminant validity. A confirmatory factor analysis (CFA) was performed to test the factor structure. Lastly, the internal consistency and face validity were assessed.The convergent and discriminant validity were good, with respective correlations of 0.730 (p < 0.001) and 0.030 (p > 0.050) between the PCRS and the ACIC SMS subscale and the PCRS and the CS-PAM. Although 49% of the variance of the PCRS was explained by one factor, the CFA could not confirm a fit between a one-factor model and the data. The reliability was excellent (Cronbach's α = 0.921).The PCRS showed good validity and excellent internal consistency. However, the evidence for its validity was inconclusive. We therefore suggest rephrasing specific items."
