However, little is known of the pathways by which hepatocytes, the cell type within which these hepatitis agents replicate, sense infection, and initiate protective responses. We show that cultured hepatoma cells, including Huh7 cells, do not activate the interferon (IFN)-β promoter in response to extracellular poly(I-C). In contrast, the addition of poly(I-C) to culture media activates the IFN-β promoter and results in robust expression of IFN-stimulated genes (ISG) in PH5CH8 cells, which are derived from non-neoplastic hepatocytes transformed with large T antigen. Small interfering RNA knockdown of TLR3 or its adaptor, Toll-interleukin-1 receptor domain-containing adaptor inducing IFN-β (TRIF), blocked extracellular poly(I-C) signaling in PH5CH8 cells, whereas poly(I-C) responsiveness could be conferred on Huh7 hepatoma cells by ectopic expression of Toll-like receptor 3 (TLR3). In contrast to poly(I-C), both cell types signal the presence of Sendai virus infection through a TLR3-independent intracellular pathway requiring expression of retinoic acid-inducible gene I (RIG-I), a putative cellular RNA helicase. Silencing of RIG-I expression impaired only the response to Sendai virus and not extracellular poly(I-C). We conclude that hepatocytes contain two distinct antiviral signaling pathways leading to expression of type I IFNs, one dependent upon TLR3 and the other dependent on RIG-I, with little cross-talk between these pathways.

The innate immune system represents the first line of defense against viral infections in mammalian cells. It senses invading viral pathogens and initiates signaling pathways leading to the induction of protective cellular genes, including type I interferons (IFN-α and IFN-β) 1The abbreviations used are: IFN, interferon; dsRNA, double-stranded RNA; HCV, hepatitis C virus; IRF-3, interferon regulatory factor 3; ISG, interferon-stimulated gene; MDA5, melanoma differentiation associated gene-5; MyD88, myeloid differentiation factor 88; RIG-I, retinoic acid-inducible gene I; SenV, Sendai virus; siRNA, small interfering RNA; TLR, Toll-like receptor; TRIF, Toll-IL1 receptor domain-containing adaptor inducing IFN-β; PRR, pattern recognition receptor; PAMP, pathogen-associated molecular patterns; CARD, caspase-recruitment domain; HBV, hepatitis B virus; pAb, polyclonal antibody; RT, reverse transcription; HAU, hemagglutinin unit(s); GAPDH, glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase. and proinflammatory cytokines that directly limit viral replication and also help to shape subsequent adaptive immune responses (1Janssens S.

Recognition of conserved molecular structures that are expressed by large groups of pathogens (pathogen-associated molecular patterns, PAMPs) is carried out by specific pattern recognition receptor (PRR) molecules (3Boehme K.W.

The Toll-like receptors (TLRs) are a class of PRRs that have been shown to detect infection by many types of pathogens, including viruses (5Akira S. Hemmi H. Immunol. Lett. 2003; 85: 85-95Crossref PubMed Scopus (930) Google Scholar). TLR3 is engaged specifically by double-stranded (ds) RNA that is present either in viral genomes or generated during viral replication, and is involved in the cellular recognition of RNA viruses and induction of type I IFN responses (6Alexopoulou L. Holt A.C. Medzhitov R. Flavell R.A. Nature. 2001; 413: 732-738Crossref PubMed Scopus (4959) Google Scholar). However, several recent studies indicate that viral infection can also activate host responses through TLR3-independent pathways (7Lund J.M. Alexopoulou L. Sato A. Karow M. Adams N.C. Gale N.W.

Whereas TLR3 signaling requires the adaptor protein, Toll-IL1 receptor (TIR) domain-containing adaptor inducing IFN-β (TRIF/TICAM-1) (12Hoebe K. Du X. Georgel P. Janssen E. Tabeta K. Kim S.O.

Alexopoulou L. Sato A. Karow M. Adams N.C. Gale N.W. Iwasaki A. Flavell R.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2004; 101: 5598-5603Crossref PubMed Scopus (1507) Google Scholar, 10Diebold S.S. Kaisho T. Hemmi H. Akira S. Reis e Sousa C. Science. 2004; 303: 1529-1531Crossref PubMed Scopus (2757) Google Scholar). Finally, virally encoded proteins may engage TLR2 or TLR4, activating MyD88-dependent pathways leading to expression of inflammatory cytokines and contributing to both viral clearance as well as pathogenesis (16Kurt-Jones E.A. Popova L. Kwinn L. Haynes L.M. Jones L.P. Tripp R.A. Walsh E.E. Freeman M.W. Golenbock D.T. Anderson L.J. Finberg R.W. Nat.

Gastroenterology. 2004; 127: 1513-1524Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (263) Google Scholar). The TLRs are not the only class of PAMP receptors that contribute to the recognition of virus infection. Yoneyama and colleagues (19Yoneyama M. Kikuchi M. Natsukawa T. Shinobu N. Imaizumi T. Miyagishi M. Taira K. Akira S. Fujita T. Nat. Immunol. 2004; 5: 730-737Crossref PubMed Scopus (3136) Google Scholar) have demonstrated recently that IFN-β production is induced in response to Newcastle disease virus infection through a pathway that is independent of TLR3 but requires the retinoic acid-inducible gene I (RIG-I, or DDX58), a cellular RNA helicase with homology to caspase-recruitment domain (CARD) proteins. The ability of these pathways to induce the expression of type I IFNs and subsequently a wide array of IFN-stimulated genes (ISGs) is likely to influence the outcome of infection by many human viruses. Such responses may have direct antiviral effects within the infected cell (2Sen G.C. Annu. Rev. Microbiol. 2001; 55: 255-281Crossref PubMed Scopus (794) Google Scholar). Type 1 IFNs also exert critically important immunoregulatory effects, including stimulation of natural killer cell cytotoxicity, activation of γδ T cells, and stimulation of immunoglobulin synthesis. Cytokines and chemokines induced by the activation of these signaling pathways also contribute to the maturation of dendritic cells and influence the priming of TH1 and cytotoxic T cells (20Beignon A.S. Skoberne M. Bhardwaj N. Nat. Immunol. 2003; 4: 939-941Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). These responses thus may play critical roles in shaping subsequent adaptive T cell responses that are required for the ultimate elimination of viruses (21Iwasaki A. Medzhitov R. Nat. Immunol. 2004; 5: 987-995Crossref PubMed Scopus (3368) Google Scholar, 22Hoebe K. Janssen E. Beutler B. Nat. Immunol. 2004; 5: 971-974Crossref PubMed Scopus (704) Google Scholar). Although the liver is a particularly important site of persistent viral infections in humans, very little is known about how these signaling pathways function specifically in hepatocytes. Despite this, there is strong, albeit indirect evidence, that type I IFN responses are important in the pathogenesis of chronic viral hepatitis. Both hepatitis B virus (HBV) and hepatitis C virus (HCV) cause persistent infections involving the hepatocyte, and both have evolved mechanisms to disrupt the induction of type I IFNs. Although not well understood, the core protein of HBV inhibits the transcription of IFN-β (23Twu J.S. Lee C.H. Lin P.M. Schloemer R.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1988; 85: 252-256Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar, 24Whitten T.M. Quets A.T. Schloemer R.H. J. Virol. 1991; 65: 4699-4704Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Similarly, the NS3/4A protease of HCV blocks Sendai virus (SenV)-induced activation of IFN regulatory factor 3 (IRF-3), a cellular transcription factor that plays a critical role in the expression of IFN-β (25Foy E. Li K. Wang C. Sumpter Jr., R. Ikeda M. Lemon S.M. Gale M. Science. 2003; 300: 1145-1148Crossref PubMed Scopus (707) Google Scholar). IRF-3 blockade is dependent upon the protease activity of NS3/4A, suggesting that NS3/4A proteolytically targets one or more cellular proteins residing within the signaling pathways leading to IRF-3 activation and type I IFN production (25Foy E. Li K. Wang C. Sumpter Jr., R. Ikeda M. Lemon S.M. Gale M. Science. 2003; 300: 1145-1148Crossref PubMed Scopus (707) Google Scholar). These and other data (26Li K. Foy E. Ferreon J.C. Nakamura M. Ferreon A.C. Ikeda M. Ray S.C. Gale M. Lemon S.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2005; 102: 2992-2997Crossref PubMed Scopus (931) Google Scholar, 27Foy E. Li K. Sumpter R. Loo Y-M. Johnson C.

Here, we describe efforts to better define the antiviral signaling pathways that are active in cultured hepatocyte-derived cell lines and that thus may be triggered by HBV or HCV infection in vivo. Cell Culture and Reagents—Murine macrophage RAW264.7, human hepatoma Huh7, Huh7.5 (kindly provided by C. M. Rice via Apath), HepG2, Hep3B cells, and PH5CH8, a simian virus 40 (SV40) large T antigen-immortalized non-neoplastic human hepatocyte cell line (28Ikeda M. Sugiyama K. Mizutani T. Tanaka T. Tanaka K. Sekihara H. Shimotohno K. Kato N. Virus Res. 1998; 56: 157-167Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar), were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% heat-inactivated fetal bovine serum, 100 units/ml penicillin G and streptomycin in a humidified 37 °C, 5% CO2 incubator. Poly(I-C) was purchased from Sigma. Bafilomycin A1 was from Calbiochem. Recombinant human interleukin-1β was from Raybiotech. R-848 was kindly provided by K. A. Fitzgerald. Plasmids—pIFN-β-luc, pCMV1FlagTLR3, pCMV1FlagTLR3DN, and pEF-Bos Flag-RIG-I were generous gifts of Rongtuan Lin, Ruslan Medizhitov, and Takashi Fujita, respectively. The ISG54 ISRE-Luc and pNFκB-Luc plasmids were from Stratagene. Sequence encoding a dominant negative form of MyD88, which lacks the amino-terminal death domain (29Muzio M. Ni J. Feng P. Dixit V.M. Science. 1997; 278: 1612-1615Crossref PubMed Scopus (988) Google Scholar), was amplified from cDNA transcribed from PH5CH8 cell RNA, and cloned into pCDNA3.1 V5-His TOPO (Invitrogen). pPRDII-luc has been described previously (30Fredericksen B. Akkaraju G.R. Foy E. Wang C. Pflugheber J. Chen Z.J. Gale Jr., M. Viral Immunol. 2002; 15: 29-40Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). pCMV-β-galactosidase (Clontech) was used to normalize transfection efficiencies. Cells were transfected with plasmid DNAs using TransIT-LT1 (Mirus) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Sendai Virus Infection—Cells were infected with 100 hemagglutinin units/ml of SenV (Charles River Laboratory) and harvested 16 h later for luciferase/β-galactosidase reporter assays or immunoblot analysis as previously described (25Foy E. Li K. Wang C. Sumpter Jr., R. Ikeda M. Lemon S.M. Gale M. Science. 2003; 300: 1145-1148Crossref PubMed Scopus (707) Google Scholar). Poly(I-C) Treatment—Poly(I-C) was added directly to the medium at 50 μg/ml (M-pIC), or complexed with Lipofectin for transfection (T-pIC). Cells were assayed for poly(I-C) induced responses 6 h after exposure by either route. Reporter Gene Assay—Cells (5 × 104 cells per well in 24-well plates) were transfected with reporter plasmids (100 ng), pCMV-β-galactosidase (100 ng), and the indicated amounts of an expression vector. Twenty-four hours later, cells were mock treated or treated with 20 ng/ml interleukin-1β, or challenged with poly(I-C) or Sendai virus, then subsequently lysed and assayed for luciferase and β-galactosidase activities as indicated. For comparisons, luciferase activity was normalized to β-galactosidase activity. Data are expressed as mean relative luciferase activity ± S.D. for one representative experiment carried out in triplicate, typically from a minimum of three separate experiments. The–fold induction of promoter activity was calculated by dividing the relative luciferase activity of stimulated cells with that of mock-treated cells. Immunoblot Analysis—Cellular extracts were subjected to immunoblot analysis as described (25Foy E. Li K. Wang C. Sumpter Jr., R. Ikeda M. Lemon S.M. Gale M. Science. 2003; 300: 1145-1148Crossref PubMed Scopus (707) Google Scholar). Briefly, protein samples were separated by SDS-PAGE, and transferred to Hybond enhanced chemiluminescent (ECL) nitrocellulose membranes (Amersham Biosciences). The membranes were blocked with 3% nonfat milk in phosphate-buffered saline and processed for immunodetection using the following monoclonal or polyclonal (pAb) antibodies: anti-FLAG M2 and anti-actin monoclonal antibodies (Sigma), anti-TLR3 monoclonal antibody (Imgenex), rabbit anti-MyD88 pAb (Santa Cruz), rabbit anti-IRF-3 pAb (kindly provided by Michael David), rabbit anti-ISG15 pAb (kindly provided by Arthur Haas), rabbit anti-ISG56 pAb (kindly provided by Ganes Sen), rabbit anti-MxA and anti-Sendai virus pAbs (kindly provided by Ilkka Julkunen), peroxidase-conjugated secondary donkey anti-rabbit (Jackson ImmunoResearch), and sheep anti-mouse (Amersham Biosciences) pAbs. Protein bands were visualized using ECL Plus Western blotting detection reagents (Amersham Biosciences), followed by exposure to Kodak Bio-Max film. RNA Interference—Transfections of siRNAs targeting TLR3, TRIF, or RIG-I were carried out using Oligofectamine (Invitrogen) with a final concentration of siRNA of 80 nm according to the manufacturer's instructions. The target sequences of siRNA used in this study were: TLR3, GGTATAGCCAGCTAACTAG; TRIF (13Oshiumi H. Matsumoto M. Funami K. Akazawa T. Seya T. Nat. Immunol. 2003; 4: 161-167Crossref PubMed Scopus (1014) Google Scholar), GACCAGACGCCACTCCAAC; RIG-I, GGAAGAGGTGCAGTATATT; and MDA5, GGTGAAGGAGCAGATTCAG. siRNAs were purchased from Dharmacon and Ambion. The scrambled negative control siRNA was from Ambion. RT-PCR—Total cellular RNA was extracted with TRIzol Reagent (Invitrogen), treated with DNase I to remove genomic DNA contamination, and reverse-transcribed using Advantage RT-4PCR kit (Clontech). The resulting cDNA was subjected to PCR using primers (Table I) specific for IFN-β, TLR3, TRIF, ISG56, RIG-I, MDA5, β-actin, and GAPDH, respectively. The quantity of the cDNA template included in these reactions and the number of amplification cycles were optimized to ensure that reactions were stopped during the linear phase of product amplification, permitting semiquantitative comparisons of mRNA abundance between different RNA preparations. To exclude the possibility of contaminating DNA, control reactions were performed in parallel in the absence of reverse transcriptase. PCR products were visualized by agarose gel electrophoresis.Table IGene-specific primers for semiquantitative RT-PCRGene namePrimer sequenceaGAPDH primers were purchased from Clontech.Product sizebpIFN-βForwardgattcatctagcactggctgg186ReversecttcaggtaatgcagaatccTLR3Forwardtcacttgctcattctccctt157ReversegacctctccattcctggcTRIFForwardccagatgcaacctccactgg339ReversectgttccgatgatgattccISG56Forwardtagccaacatgtcctcacagac396ReversetcttctaccactggtttcatgcRIG-IForwardcagtatattcaggctgag389ReverseggccagttttccttgtcMDA5Forwardagtttggcagaaggaagtgtc480Reverseggagttttcaaggatttgagca GAPDH primers were purchased from Clontech. Open table in a new tab Cultured Hepatocyte Cell Lines Differ in Their Ability to Activate IFN-β Transcription in Response to dsRNA or Virus Infection—The induction of type I IFNs represents an early protective response to many viral infections in mammalian cells. IFN-β induction represents the immediate response of cells to viral infection, and precedes the transcription of most IFN-α species, the induction of which depends on autocrine/paracrine feedback of IFN-β and activation of IRF-7 (31Levy D.E. Marie I. Prakash A. Curr. Opin. Immunol. 2003; 15: 52-58Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar). We thus focused on characterizing the IFN-β response. The molecular basis for induction of IFN-β expression has been extensively studied and shown to be induced by dsRNA or other products of virus infection through coordinate activation of transcription factors IRF-3, NF-κB, and ATF-2/c-Jun (2Sen G.C. Annu. Rev. Microbiol. 2001; 55: 255-281Crossref PubMed Scopus (794) Google Scholar). Most of these studies were conducted in human embryonic kidney 293 or epithelial cells, and relatively little is known about these events in hepatocytes, which constitute ∼80% of the liver cell population (32Kmiec Z. Adv. Anat. Embryol. Cell Biol. 2001; 161 (III—XIII): 1-151Crossref Google Scholar), and are the primary cells within which both HBV and HCV replicate. Because primary differentiated hepatocytes are difficult to maintain in culture, we studied 3 different continuous cell lines derived from human hepatocellular carcinomas: Huh7 cells, which appear to be particularly permissive for HCV RNA replication (33Nakabayashi H. Taketa K. Miyano K. Yamane T. Sato J. Cancer Res. 1982; 42: 3858-3863PubMed Google Scholar, 34Lohmann V. Korner F. Koch J. Herian U. Theilmann L. Bartenschlager R. Science. 1999; 285: 110-113Crossref PubMed Scopus (2505) Google Scholar); HepG2 cells and Hep3B cells, the latter of which contains integrated HBV DNA and express the HBV envelope protein, HBsAg (35Knowles B.B. Howe C.C. Aden D.P. Science. 1980; 209: 497-499Crossref PubMed Scopus (1508) Google Scholar). Huh7 cells are not available from any standard repository, but are carried in many different laboratories and different laboratory variants may show significant variation in morphology and perhaps other characteristics. We thus studied 3 different Huh7 sublines: Huh7 SL, cells carried in this laboratory for many years; Huh7 2–3c, cells derived from Huh7 SL that were selected for their ability to support replication of genome-length HCV RNA and subsequently “cured” of the replicating RNA with IFN-α2b treatment (36Scholle F. Li K. Bodola F. Ikeda M. Luxon B.A. Lemon S.M. J. Virol. 2004; 78: 1513-1524Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar), and Huh7 MG cells, Huh7 cells carried in the Gale laboratory at the University of Texas South-western Medical Center. We also studied the PH5CH8 cell line, which is a clonal variant of a non-neoplastic hepatocyte cell line, PH5CH, immortalized with the simian virus 40 large T antigen (28Ikeda M. Sugiyama K. Mizutani T. Tanaka T. Tanaka K. Sekihara H. Shimotohno K. Kato N. Virus Res. 1998; 56: 157-167Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar, 37Noguchi M. Hirohashi S. In Vitro Cell Dev. Biol. Anim. 1996; 32: 135-137Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar, 38Kato N. Ikeda M. Mizutani T. Sugiyama K. Noguchi M. Hirohashi S. Shimotohno K. Jpn. J. Cancer Res. 1996; 87: 787-792Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). We characterized virus-induced activation of the IFN-β promoter in these various hepatocyte-derived cell lines after transient transfection with a reporter plasmid expressing luciferase under control of the IFN-β promoter. Although the PH5CH8 cell line has been reported to support replication of HCV (28Ikeda M. Sugiyama K. Mizutani T. Tanaka T. Tanaka K. Sekihara H. Shimotohno K. Kato N. Virus Res. 1998; 56: 157-167Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar), no cultured cell has been reported to be fully for HCV replication. Thus, to challenge these cells, we exposed them to the dsRNA analog, poly(I-C), or infected them with SenV. Interestingly, when poly(I-C) was added to the culture medium, there was no induction of IFN-β promoter activity in the Huh7, HepG2, or Hep3B hepatoma cells (M-pIC, Fig. 1A, upper panel). In contrast, the PH5CH8 cells demonstrated a 6-fold up-regulation of IFN-β promoter activity upon exposure to poly(I-C) (Fig. 1A, upper panel). Consistent with the reporter data, M-pIC treatment significantly up-regulated the expression of ISG15 and ISG56, which are responsive to either IRF-3 or IFN, in PH5CH8 cells, but not in hepatoma cell lines Huh7, HepG2, or Hep3B (Fig. 1B). To mimic intracellular dsRNA generated during viral replication, we also transfected poly(I-C) into cells using a liposome-mediated procedure. This resulted in much more potent stimulation of the IFN-β promoter in PH5CH8 cells, leading to a 17-fold increase in activity over basal promoter levels (T-pIC, Fig. 1A, middle panel). It also resulted in significant activation of the IFN-β promoter in HepG2 (8-fold induction) and Hep3B (4-fold induction) cells. However, under the same conditions, there was little if any activation of the promoter in any of the Huh7 cell sublines. These promoter assay results were confirmed by RT-PCR analysis of endogenous IFN-β mRNA synthesis in cells transfected with increasing concentrations of poly(I-C) (Fig. 1C). Whereas transfection of as little as 1 μg/ml poly(I-C) induced IFN-β transcription in HepG2, Hep3B, and PH5CH8 cells, there was no detectable IFN-β mRNA in Huh7 SL cells transfected with up to 100 μg/ml poly(I-C). A similar pattern of IFN-β induction was observed following infection of these different cell lines with SenV. The greatest induction of IFN-β promoter activity occurred in PH5CH8 cells (96-fold increase over basal promoter activity), followed by HepG2 (35-fold), and Hep3B (10-fold) (Fig. 1A, lower panel). However, there were significant differences in the magnitude of the IFN-β promoter activation induced by SenV infection in the different Huh7 cell lines. SenV infection induced IFN-β promoter activity by ∼10-fold in the Huh7 MG cells, but only 1.5-fold in Huh7 SL cells and 3-fold in the cured Huh7 2–3c cells (Fig. 1A, lower panel). We conclude from these results that cultured hepatoma cells generally have impaired poly(I-C)- and virus-activated IFN responses, compared with the PH5CH8 cells that were established from non-neoplastic hepatocytes. These latter cells retain robust IFN-β responses to extracellular and intracellular poly(I-C) as well as SenV infection. They are likely to more closely resemble normal hepatocytes in vivo, and thus may represent a superior cell model for investigation of antiviral responses in hepatocytes. The considerable variation we observed in the IFN response in different Huh7 cell lines mandates caution in comparing studies carried out with these cells in different laboratories, an important point because Huh7 cells are widely used for cell culture studies with HCV. TLR3 and TRIF Are Not Required for SenV Activation of the IFN-β Promoter in PH5CH8 Cells—TLR3 is the only known TLR that recognizes viral dsRNA and it is expressed both on the cell surface and within intracellular vesicles (39Matsumoto M. Funami K. Oshiumi H. Seya T. Microbiol. Immunol. 2004; 48: 147-154Crossref PubMed Scopus (174) Google Scholar, 40Matsumoto M. Funami K. Tanabe M. Oshiumi H. Shingai M. Seto Y. Yamamoto A. Seya T. J. Immunol. 2003; 171: 3154-3162Crossref PubMed Scopus (622) Google Scholar). We were thus interested in determining whether the virus-induced IFN response involves TLR3 in PH5CH8 cells. To investigate this, we transfected the cells with a synthetic siRNA duplex targeting human TLR3, or a scrambled negative-control siRNA, then challenged the cells by adding poly(I-C) to the media or infecting them with SenV prior to measuring IFN-β promoter activity (Fig. 2). PH5CH8 cells express a readily detectable abundance of TLR3 mRNA, which was reduced to almost undetectable levels upon transfection of TLR3-specific siRNA (Fig. 2B). The induction of IFN-β promoter activity by extracellular poly(I-C) was substantially reduced by this siRNA knockdown of TLR3 expression (Fig. 2A, left panel). In contrast, there was no appreciable effect on SenV-induced IFN-β promoter activation (Fig. 2A, right panel). TRIF is an essential adaptor protein that links TLR3 to down-stream kinases responsible for IRF-3 activation and IFN-β production (13Oshiumi H. Matsumoto M. Funami K. Akazawa T. Seya T. Nat. Immunol. 2003; 4: 161-167Crossref PubMed Scopus (1014) Google Scholar, 14Yamamoto M. Sato S. Mori K. Hoshino K. Takeuchi O. Takeda K. Akira S. J.

Science. 2003; 301: 640-643Crossref PubMed Scopus (2527) Google Scholar). It may well play additional roles in intracellular signaling events, given its relatively large size (712 amino acids) compared with other TLR adaptors. Mice that are deficient for TRIF function have an impaired response to murine cytomegalovirus infection (12Hoebe K. Du X. Georgel P. Janssen E. Tabeta K. Kim S.O. Goode J. Lin P. Mann N. Mudd S. Crozat K. Sovath S. Han J. Beutler B. Nature. 2003; 424: 743-748Crossref PubMed Scopus (1037) Google Scholar). The liver contains a higher abundance of TRIF than any other organ (14Yamamoto M. Sato S. Mori K. Hoshino K. Takeuchi O. Takeda K. Akira S. J. Immunol. 2002; 169: 6668-6672Crossref PubMed Scopus (1025) Google Scholar), suggesting that it may play a particularly important role in intrahepatic signaling. To determine whether TRIF is required to mount a type I IFN response against SenV in hepatocytes, we carried out a TRIF knockdown experiment in PH5CH8 cells. As shown in Fig. 2D, semiquantitative RT-PCR demonstrated that transfection of the TRIF-specific siRNA efficiently reduced TRIF mRNA abundance. As expected fr"

https://openalex.org/W2070878775,"Curcumin (diferuloylmethane) is known to induce apoptosis in tumor cells. In asynchronous cultures, with time-lapse video-micrography in combination with quantitative fluorescence microscopy, we have demonstrated that curcumin induces apoptosis at G2 phase of cell cycle in deregulated cyclin D1-expressed mammary epithelial carcinoma cells, leaving its normal counterpart unaffected. In our search toward delineating the molecular mechanisms behind such differential activities of curcumin, we found that it selectively increases p53 expression at G2 phase of carcinoma cells and releases cytochrome c from mitochondria, which is an essential requirement for apoptosis. Further experiments using p53-null as well as dominant-negative and wild-type p53-transfected cells have established that curcumin induces apoptosis in carcinoma cells via a p53-dependent pathway. On the other hand, curcumin reversibly inhibits normal mammary epithelial cell cycle progression by down-regulating cyclin D1 expression and blocking its association with Cdk4/Cdk6 as well as by inhibiting phosphorylation and inactivation of retinoblastoma protein. In addition, curcumin significantly up-regulates cell cycle inhibitory protein (p21Waf-1) in normal cells and arrests them in G0 phase of cell cycle. Therefore, these cells escape from curcumin-induced apoptosis at G2 phase. Interestingly, these processes remain unaffected by curcumin in carcinoma cells where cyclin D1 expression is high. Similarly, in ectopically overexpressed system, curcumin cannot down-regulate cyclin D1 and thus block cell cycle progression. Hence, these cells progress into G2 phase and undergo apoptosis. These observations together suggest that curcumin may have a possible therapeutic potential in breast cancer patients. Curcumin (diferuloylmethane) is known to induce apoptosis in tumor cells.

These observations together suggest that curcumin may have a possible therapeutic potential in breast cancer patients. Cell proliferation is tightly regulated by multiple interactions between molecules in normal cells. Progression through several major checkpoints in the cell cycle is controlled by multiple protein kinases, each of which contains a regulatory cyclin and a catalytic cyclin-dependent kinase (Cdk) 1The abbreviations used are: Cdk, cyclin-dependent kinase; BrdUrd, 5-bromo-2-deoxyuridine; DN, dominant-negative; CCD, charged-coupled device; MEF, mouse embryonic fibroblast; DAPI, 4′6′-diamidino-2-phenylindole; WT, wild type; NME, normal mammary epithelial; TdT, terminal deoxynucleotidyltransferase; TUNEL, (TdT-mediated dUTP nick-end labeling; GST, glutathione S-transferase; PI, propidium iodide; RB, retinoblastoma; pRb, RB protein.

The expression level of each component, its phosphorylation status, and the presence of specific Cdk inhibitory proteins regulate the activity of these kinases (2Hall M. Peters G. Adv.

In mammalian cells, the D cyclins with their catalytic partners, Cdk4 and Cdk6, function as the cells leave G0 and progress through G1 into S phase (2Hall M. Peters G. Adv.

In majority of human breast cancers, deregulated overexpression of cyclin D1 is found, whereas in normal cells, its expression is tightly regulated by mitogenic signaling involving p21 Ras pathway (6Yu Q. Geng Y. Sicinski P. Nature. 2001; 411: 1017-1021Crossref PubMed Scopus (826) Google Scholar). In many cell types, aberrant expression of cell cycle regulatory proteins can induce cell cycle progression under conditions that are normally growth-suppressive, leading to apoptosis (cell death) (7Evan G.I. Wyllie A.H. Gilbert C.S. Littlewood T.D. Land H. Brooks M. Waters C.M. Penn L.Z. Hancock D.C. Cell. 1992; 69: 119-128Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2773) Google Scholar, 8Sofer L.Y. Resnitzky D. Oncogene. 1996; 13: 2431-2437PubMed Google Scholar). It is also reported that DNA damage response pathway causes cell cycle arrest by regulating cyclin/Cdk via checkpoint inhibitors and thus provides time for DNA repair. However, when the damage is irreparable, the cells undergo apoptosis (9Hartwell L.H. Kastan M.B. Science. 1994; 266: 1821-1828Crossref PubMed Scopus (2312) Google Scholar, 10Elledge S.J. Science. 1996; 274: 1664-1672Crossref PubMed Scopus (1765) Google Scholar). Among these inhibitors, p21Waf-1 and p27Kip-1 belong to the family of broad-specificity inhibitors of cyclin/Cdk complexes (11El-Diery W.S. Harper J.W. O'Connor P.M. Velculescu V.E. Canman C.E. Jackman J. Pietenpol J.A. Burrell M. Hill D.E. Wang Y. et al.Cancer Res. 1994; 54: 1169-1174PubMed Google Scholar, 12Toyoshima H. Hunter T.

Cell Res. 2004; 300: 427-439Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar), whereas each of the Ink4 family members binds directly to Cdk4 and Cdk6 and functions as specific inhibitor of cyclin D-dependent kinases (1Sherr C.J. Science. 1996; 274: 1672-1677Crossref PubMed Scopus (4977) Google Scholar, 2Hall M. Peters G. Adv. Cancer Res. 1996; 68: 67-108Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). All of these observations indicate the possibility of the candidacy of cyclin D1 as a therapeutic target in breast cancer and the importance of these checkpoint inhibitors in regulating this cyclin. Besides cyclins, Cdks, and inhibitors, p53 has a central role in cell cycle regulation as a tumor suppressor. Researches conducted in the last two decades have firmly established the importance of p53 in mediating the cell cycle arrest that occurs following DNA damage. However, during the same time, the role of p53 in mediating apoptosis has become increasingly less clear, even as the number of putative pro-apoptotic proteins trans-activated by p53 has increased (14Agarwal M.L. Taylor W.R. Chernov M.V. Chernov O.B. Stark G.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 1-4Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (648) Google Scholar). Similarly unclear is how p53 makes a choice between cell cycle arrest and apoptosis, raising the possibility that p53 alone is not responsible for this crucial decision. An important function of p53 is to act as a transcription factor by binding to a p53-specific DNA consensus sequence in responsive genes (15Zambetti G.P. Levine A.J. FASEB J. 1993; 7: 855-865Crossref PubMed Scopus (417) Google Scholar), which would be expected to increase the synthesis of p21Waf-1 or Bax (11El-Diery W.S. Harper J.W. O'Connor P.M. Velculescu V.E. Canman C.E. Jackman J. Pietenpol J.A. Burrell M. Hill D.E. Wang Y. et al.Cancer Res. 1994; 54: 1169-1174PubMed Google Scholar, 16Miyashita T. Reed J.C. Cell. 1995; 80: 293-299Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (305) Google Scholar). Up-regulation of p21Waf-1 results in the inhibition of cell cycle progression from G1 to S phase of cell cycle (11El-Diery W.S. Harper J.W. O'Connor P.M. Velculescu V.E. Canman C.E. Jackman J. Pietenpol J.A. Burrell M. Hill D.E. Wang Y. et al.Cancer Res. 1994; 54: 1169-1174PubMed Google Scholar). On the other hand, the up-regulation of Bax alters Bcl-2/Bax ratio in cellular microenvironment and causes the release of cytochrome c from mitochondria into the cytosol. Cytochrome c then binds to Apaf-1 and activates caspase-3 through caspase-9, which is responsible for the latter process of apoptosis (17Liu X. Kim C.N. Yang J. Jemmerson R. Wang X. Cell. 1996; 86: 147-157Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (4463) Google Scholar). Therefore, any agent that can regulate these processes in cancer cells may have a role in tumor regression. Recently, the use of phytochemicals as anti-cancer agent has gained high importance. Among various naturally occurring phytochemicals, curcumin is capturing the attention of cancer investigators worldwide because of its chemo-preventive properties against human malignancies (18Pal S. Choudhuri T. Chattopadhyay S. Bhattacharyya A. Datta G.K. Das T. Sa G. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2001; 288: 658-665Crossref PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar, 19Rinaldi A.L. Morse M.A. Fields H.W. Rothas D.A. Pei P. Rodrigo K.A. Renner R.J. Mallery S.R. Cancer Res. 2002; 62: 5451-5456PubMed Google Scholar, 20Choudhuri T. Pal S. Agwarwal M.L. Das T. Sa G. FEBS Lett. 2002; 512: 334-340Crossref PubMed Scopus (352) Google Scholar). The anti-carcinogenic properties of curcumin in animals have been demonstrated by its inhibition of tumor initiation induced by various carcinogens (21Liu J.Y. Lin S.J. Lin S.K. Carcinogenesis. 1993; 14: 857-861Crossref PubMed Scopus (263) Google Scholar, 22Kawamori T. Lubet R. Steele V.E. Kelloff G.J. Kaskey R.B. Rao C.V. Reddy B.S. Cancer Res. 1999; 59: 597-601PubMed Google Scholar). This yellow pigment interrupts cell cycle, disrupts mitotic spindle structure, and induces micro-nucleation, thereby acting as anti-proliferative agent in various cancer cells (23Holy J.M. Mutat. Res. 2002; 518: 71-84Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). We have already reported that curcumin induces apoptosis in human breast carcinoma cells (20Choudhuri T. Pal S. Agwarwal M.L. Das T. Sa G. FEBS Lett. 2002; 512: 334-340Crossref PubMed Scopus (352) Google Scholar). In contrast, curcumin has been found to protect normal cells from stress-induced apoptosis (24Oyama Y. Masuda T. Nakata M. Chikahisa L. Yamazaki Y. Miura K. Okagawa M. Eur. J. Pharmacol. 1998; 360: 65-71Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). Inhibition of both proliferation and apoptosis of T lymphocytes by this curry pigment led us to conclude that the inhibition of cell proliferation by curcumin was not always associated with programmed cell death (25Sikora E. Bielak-Zmijewska A. Piwocka K. Skierski J. Radziszewska E. Biochem. Pharmacol. 1997; 54: 899-907Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar). Interestingly, curcumin has been found to non-selectively inhibit proliferation of normal as well as malignant cell, although its apoptogenic effect is more profound in malignant cells (26Ramchandran C. You Y. Breast Cancer Res. Treat. 1999; 54: 269-278Crossref PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar). Curcumin-induced suppression of cell proliferation correlates with down-regulation of cyclin D1 expression and Cdk4-mediated retinoblastoma protein phosphorylation (27Mukhopadhyay A. Banerjee S. Stafford L.J. Xia C. Liu M. Aggarwal B.B. Oncogene. 2002; 21: 8852-8861Crossref PubMed Scopus (308) Google Scholar). However, the molecular mechanisms underlying such differential effect of curcumin in normal and malignant cells are not yet clearly understood. Because a cell can undergo apoptosis at any phase of cell cycle and cell cycle regulatory proteins play a vital role in deciding the fate of the cell, the possibility of these proteins to be the targets of curcumin cannot be overruled. Therefore, we hypothesized that curcumin may be regulating the cell cycle differentially in normal and malignant cells, thus showing differential effects in them. To prove this hypothesis, we aimed at mapping the molecular mechanisms of such differential effects of curcumin in normal and malignant cells. Cell Culture—Human mammary epithelial carcinoma cells (MCF-7, T47-D, MDA-MB-468, and MDA-MB-231), prostate cancer cell lines (PC-3 and LNCap), and B cell lymphoma cells (Daudi) were obtained from National Center for Cell Sciences (Pune, India). The MDA-H0-41 post-crisis skin fibroblast cell line was derived from a patient with Li-Fraumeni syndrome, and TR9-7 cells expressing wild-type p53 under the control of a tetracycline-regulated promoter were derived from this cell line (20Choudhuri T. Pal S. Agwarwal M.L. Das T. Sa G. FEBS Lett. 2002; 512: 334-340Crossref PubMed Scopus (352) Google Scholar). PC-3-WT-p53 cells were derived from p53-negative PC-3 cells through an adenoviral vectors expression system expressing wild-type p53 under the control of cytomegalovirus promoter, and MCF-7-DN-p53 and T47-D-DN-p53 cells were derived from MCF-7 and T47-D cells through an adenoviral vectors expression system expressing dominant-negative p53 under the control of cytomegalovirus promoter (Clontech). Mantle cell lymphoma, NIH 3T3 cells, and NIH 3T3 cells expressing oncogenic p21ras (Val16-Ras (V16ras)) and cyclin D1 knock-out mouse embryonic fibroblast (MEF D1–/–) cells were obtained from Dr. Dennis W. Stacey (The Cleveland Clinic Foundation). Cyclin D1-overexpressed MEF-D1+/+ cells were derived from MEF-D1–/– cells through cytomegalovirus promoter-driven cyclin D1 expression system. Cells were routinely maintained in Dulbecco's minimal Eagle's medium or RPMI 1640 medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum, insulin (0.1 units/ml), l-glutamine (2 mm), sodium pyruvate (100 μg/ml), non-essential amino acids (100 μm), and antibiotics (100 μg/ml streptomycin and 50 unit/ml penicillin) (Sigma) at 37 °C in a humidified incubator containing 5% CO2. Human normal mammary epithelial cells (NME, Clonetics) were maintained in mammary epithelial cell growth medium supplemented with SingleQuots (Clontech). Immunofluorescence and Measurement of Fluorescent Signal of Each Immunostained Cell—Cells growing on a coverslip were incubated with 5 μm 5-bromo-2-deoxyuridine (BrdUrd, Roche Applied Science) for the last 30 min before fixation with 3% p-formaldehyde/Triton X-100. Incorporated BrdUrd or p53/cytochrome c content of individual cells was visualized by immunofluorescence using Cy2-/Cy3-conjugated anti-BrdUrd (2 μg/ml), anti-p53, or anti-cytochrome c (Santa Cruz Biotechnology; 2 μg/ml) antibodies. For double-labeling experiments, antibody treatments were performed consecutively. Nuclear DNA was stained with 4′,6′-diamidino-2-phenylindole (DAPI, BD Biosciences). A Leica fluorescent microscope DM 900 was used to visualize the fluorescent images. Digital images were captured with a highly sensitive cool (–25 °C) charged-coupled device (CCD) camera (Princeton Instruments) controlled with the MetaMorph software (Universal Imaging). The exposure times were adjusted so that the brightest signal in the specimen gave <90% of the maximum linear range for the camera (a gray scale of 0–4096; 16-bit gray scale). Each captured image was corrected by subtracting the background image followed shading correction (to correct the uneven signal collection across the field). Nuclear regions of each cell were defined by image analysis of DAPI pictures. The fluorescence signals from individual nuclear regions were integrated for DAPI, BrdUrd, or p53 fluorescence using MetaMorph image analysis features as described earlier (for details see Refs. 13Sa G. Stacey D.W. Exp. Cell Res. 2004; 300: 427-439Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar, 28Hitomi M. Stacey D.W. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 4623-4632Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar, 29Sa G. Hitomi M. Harwalkar J. Stacey A.W. Chen G.C. Stacey D.W. Cell Cycle. 2002; 1: 50-58Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). Cells were separated into cell cycle phases based upon BrdUrd and DNA content. More than 400 cells were photographed for each set, and the average fluorescence intensity of each fluorochrome in each cell cycle phase was determined. TUNEL (TdT-mediated dUTP Nick-End Labeling) Assay—The fragmented DNA of apoptotic cells was labeled by catalytically incorporating FITC-dUTP at the 3′-hydroxyl ends of the fragmented DNA by enzyme terminal deoxynucleotidyltransferase (TdT) using Apo-direct kit (BD Biosciences) following the principle of TUNEL. The cells then were analyzed on flow cytometer (equipped with 488-nm argon laser light source; 515-nm band pass filter, FL1-H, and 623-nm band pass filter, FL2-H) using CellQuest software (BD Biosciences). Electronic compensation of the instrument was done to exclude overlapping of the emission spectra. Total 10,000 events were acquired, and dual parameter dot plot of FL2-H (x axis; PI fluorescence, linear scale) versus FL1-H (y axis; FITC fluorescence, logarithmic scale) has been shown. Time-lapse Video-micrography for Determination of Cell Cycle Position—The appropriate number of cells was seeded on a coverslip in a 35-mm Petri dish. For the determination of approximate cell cycle position of individual cells and the exact time required between two divisions, time-lapse video-micrography was applied. Cells were maintained at 37 °C in a 95% air, 5% CO2 environment in a stage heater (20/20 Technology, Whitehouse Station) mounted on an inverted phase-contrast microscope. Digital images were obtained with a CCD camera attached to a frame grabber board controlled by the “NIH Image” program. Individual frames of 640 by 480 pixels were captured every 10 min. Up to 129 individual frames were captured in a single stack, which was then replayed by the NIH Image program at various speeds in the forward or backward direction to create a movie for analysis (for further details see Refs. 13Sa G. Stacey D.W. Exp. Cell Res. 2004; 300: 427-439Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar, 29Sa G. Hitomi M. Harwalkar J. Stacey A.W. Chen G.C. Stacey D.W. Cell Cycle. 2002; 1: 50-58Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar, 30Fox P.L. Sa G. Dobrowolski S.F. Stacey D.W. Oncogene. 1994; 9: 3519-3526PubMed Google Scholar). The area of the coverslip to be analyzed was marked with a circle using a diamond object marker. This allowed realignment of the area of analysis and identification of individual cells following immunostaining and nuclear staining. When second timelapse analysis was started following curcumin treatment, care was taken to ensure that the same area of the coverslip and same alignment were viewed in each movie. Individual cells were monitored, and the times between two successive divisions were calculated by the difference between two individual frame numbers multiplied by 10 min. To relate age with its cell cycle position, cells were followed in time-lapse with the final 30 min in the presence of BrdUrd. The cells were then fixed and stained with fluorescent anti-p53 and or anti-BrdUrd antibody. The age of each cell was determined individually by following that cell in the time-lapse movie beginning at the time of fixation and running the movie backwards until the cell was observed to pass through mitosis. Labeling with BrdUrd indicated that the cell had been in S phase during last 30 min. This approach allowed an analysis of cells in all of the cell cycle phases at the same time. Co-immunoprecipitation and Western Blotting—For direct Western blot analysis, cells were lysed in lysis buffer (50 mm Hepes, pH 7.6, 200 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 0.5% Nonidet P-40 supplemented with protease (10 μg/ml each of benzamidine, trypsin inhibitor, and bacitracin, 5 μg/ml each of leupeptin, pepstatin A, antipain, PMSF), and phosphatase (5 μm each of o-phosphoserine, o-phosphotyrosine, o-phosphothreonine, β-glycerophosphate, p-nitrophenylphosphate, and sodium vanadate) inhibitor cocktails). The lysate containing 50 μg of protein was separated by SDS-polyacrylamide gel. After electrophoresis, the gel was transferred to a nitrocellulose membrane. The protein of interest was visualized with chemiluminescence. The blots were re-probed with anti-α-actin antibody (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) to confirm equal protein loading (20Choudhuri T. Pal S. Agwarwal M.L. Das T. Sa G. FEBS Lett. 2002; 512: 334-340Crossref PubMed Scopus (352) Google Scholar). For the determination of direct interaction between two or more proteins, co-immunoprecipitation technique was applied. For this purpose, cells were lysed in lysis buffer. The lysates (200 μg of protein) were incubated for 4 h at 4 °C in rocking condition with 4 μg of anti-cyclin D1 antibody, and the immune-complexes then were incubated with protein A-Sepharose beads (31Sa G. Murugesan G. Jaye M. Ivashchenko Y. Fox P.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 2360-2366Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar). The immunopurified protein then was used to detect the presence of associated protein Cdk4 or Cdk6 (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) by Western blot analysis using specific antibody. Portions of the cell lysates used for co-immunoprecipitation were blotted against anti-α-actin antibody to confirm equivalent protein loading. Kinase Assay—In vitro Rb phosphorylation was done using GST-Rb as substrates (32Matsushime H. Quelle D.E. Shurtleff S.A. Shibuya M. Sherr C.J. Kato J.Y. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 2066-2076Crossref PubMed Scopus (1025) Google Scholar). Cdk4 from equal amount of cellular protein from untreated or curcumin-treated cells was immunopurified with specific antibody. The phosphorylation reaction of GST-Rb was initiated using 10 μl of immunoprecipitates in the kinase buffer (50 mm Hepes, pH 7.5, 10 mm MgCl2, 2.5 mm EDTA, 1 mm dithiothreitol, and phosphatase inhibitor cocktails) by adding ATP mixture (1 μm [γ-32P]ATP and 9 μm unlabeled ATP). The reaction was incubated at 30 °C for 30 min. Proteins were separated by 10% SDS-PAGE. Phosphorylation of Rb protein was quantitated by PhosphorImager using ImageQuant software (Amersham Biosciences). Curcumin Altered Cell Cycle Progression in Mammary Epithelial Cells but Not in Carcinoma Cells—A quantitative digital image analysis approach was used to determine cell cycle position of individual cells. The utility of this approach was first demonstrated by pulsing asynchronous culture with BrdUrd for 30 min followed by fixation and staining of DNA with DAPI and incorporated BrdUrd with a fluorescent antibody. The DAPI staining identified nuclear regions in which the levels of both DAPI and anti-BrdUrd antibody fluorescence were quantitated as in previous studies (13Sa G. Stacey D.W. Exp. Cell Res. 2004; 300: 427-439Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar, 29Sa G. Hitomi M. Harwalkar J. Stacey A.W. Chen G.C. Stacey D.W. Cell Cycle. 2002; 1: 50-58Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). Cells were separated into cell cycle phases based on BrdUrd incorporation and DNA content. When DAPI fluorescence was plotted against BrdUrd-associated fluorescence for individual cells, cells in G0/G1 and G2/M phases were localized in well-separated groups without BrdUrd staining. S phase cells displayed intermediate DNA level and were stained for BrdUrd with the highest levels of staining found in cells in mid-S phase (Fig. 1A, MCF-7 cells, and B, NME cells). Based upon BrdUrd incorporation and DNA content, when percent cells in each cell cycle phase were determined, MCF-7 cells showed typical cell cycle pattern with ∼53% cells in G0/G1 phase, 28% cells in S phase, and 16% cells in G2/M phase (Fig. 1C, 0 h). 24 h of continuous exposure to different doses of curcumin resulted in significant MCF-7 cell death, and LD50 was found to be 10 μm (data not shown). Treatment of these cells with 10 μm curcumin for various time intervals showed no difference in BrdUrd incorporation, thereby indicating that curcumin has no effect in normal cell cycle progression of these malignant cells. However, the number of cells in sub-G0/G1 populations (apoptotic cells) increased with time up to 24 h of curcumin treatment with concomitant decrease in G0/G1 populations. Even though the cells were undergoing apoptosis, they passed from G1 to S and G2 phases with predictable kinetics and displayed the expected BrdUrd incorporation. On the other hand, curcumin interfered with BrdUrd incorporation (Fig. 1D) when NME cells were treated with the same dose of curcumin for various time intervals. In fact, in the absence of curcumin, these cells showed a typical cell cycle pattern (at 0 h). When curcumin was added to the culture, the transition of cells from G1 to S phase was blocked within 4 h and the inhibition persisted up to 24 h, the time point at which most of the cells were arrested in G0/G1 phases and were BrdUrd-negative. However, there was no cell death. With longer treatment, the inhibition was released and the cells started cycling again (at 48 h). Together, these data indicate that curcumin did not alter the cell cycle progression of mammary epithelial carcinoma cells, although it induced apoptosis in the same. In contrast, it reversibly blocked normal mammary epithelial cell cycle progression without apoptosis. Curcumin Induced Mammary Epithelial Carcinoma Cell Apoptosis at G2 Phase of Cell Cycle—To find out the cell cycle phase at which curcumin induced mammary epithelial carcinoma cell apoptosis, we have adopted different methods. In the first approach, we used the TUNEL method. The cell cycle position of apoptotic cells was assessed by the TdT assay of DNA strand breaks combined with DNA staining with PI. It was interesting to note that curcumin induced MCF-7 apoptosis only in G2/M phase (Fig. 2A). In the second approach, a MCF-7 culture was followed by two sequential time-lapse movies of the same area of the coverslip (Fig. 2, B and D). Curcumin was added between two movies. The age of cells (i.e. time since last mitosis) at the time of curcumin addition was determined from the first movie, whereas the fate of the cells after curcumin addition was determined from the second movie (Fig. 2B). Almost all of the cells that passed through the S phase during curcumin treatment period (4–6 h since the addition of curcumin, curcumin was active in biological fluid for 5–6 h) (33Wang Y.J. Pan M.H. Cheng A.L. Lin L.I. Ho Y.S. Hsieh C.Y. Lin J.K. J. Pharmacol. Biomed. Anal. 1997; 15: 1867-1876Crossref PubMed Scopus (1344) Google Scholar) underwent apoptosis. Surprisingly, the cells that were in other cell cycle phases during active curcumin incubation period escaped from curcumin-induced apoptosis (Fig. 2, B and D). In Fig. 2C, there is a cluster of cells with y axis values between 6 and 20 h and x axis values between 4 and 12 h. These cells died at various ages and, given the length of G1, were probably in S phase when curcumin was added. However, there is also a uniform line of cells that traverses the graph above the cluster of apoptotic cells. This horizontal line of cells never died but represented the cells that were tracked until the end of the experiment when nothing happened to them. To support these observations, we performed a parallel experiment where BrdUrd was added during the curcumin incubation period and then excess BrdUrd was washed off after 4 h. In that case, almost all of the cells that underwent apoptosis were BrdUrd-positive (data not shown). These data suggest that curcumin is effective only when added in S phase but could exert its apoptogenic effect in G2 phase of cell cycle. Curcumin Differentially Regulated Cyclin D1 Level—We have already shown that curcumin could not block mammary epithelial carcinoma cell cycle progression but could arrest the cell cycle progression in normal mammary epithelial cells. Thus, we intend to test whether curcumin has any differential effects on cyclin D1 and D3 expression levels in these cells. Western blot data showed that curcumin could not alter the expression level of cyclin D1/D3 in MCF-7 cells, which showed normal cyclin D1 and D3 band intensities even during 48 h of curcumin treatment (Fig. 3A). In other breast (T47-D and MDA-MB-468) and prostate (PC-3 and LNCap) cancer cells as well as p53-knock-out carcinoma cells (MDA-H0-41), curcumin could down-regulate cyclin D3 but not cyclin D1 level (Fig. 3B). On the other hand, in normal mammary epithelial cells, the level of cyclin D1 started to diminish after 4 h of curcumin treatment and continued to be low up to 24 h. After 24 h, the levels of cyclin D1 again returned to its normal level (Fig. 3A). Interest"
https://openalex.org/W2007499788,"[6]-Gingerol, a pungent ingredient of ginger (Zingiber officinale Roscoe, Zingiberaceae), has a wide array of pharmacologic effects. The present study was aimed at unraveling the molecular mechanisms underlying previously reported antitumor promoting effects of [6]-gingerol in mouse skin in vivo. One of the well-recognized molecular targets for chemoprevention is cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2) that is abnormally upregulated in many premalignant and malignant tissues and cells. In our present study, topical application of [6]-gingerol inhibited COX-2 expression in mouse skin stimulated with a prototype tumor promoter 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate (TPA). Since the transcription factor nuclear factor-kappaB (NF-κB) is known to regulate COX-2 induction, we attempted to determine the effect of [6]-gingerol on TPA-induced activation of NF-κB. Pretreatment with [6]-gingerol resulted in a decrease in both TPA-induced DNA binding and transcriptional activities of NF-κB through suppression of IκBα degradation and p65 nuclear translocation. Phosphorylation of both IκBα and p65 was substantially blocked by [6]-gingerol. In addition, [6]-gingerol inhibited TPA-stimulated interaction of phospho-p65-(Ser-536) with cAMP response element binding protein-binding protein, a transcriptional coactivator of NF-κB. Moreover, [6]-gingerol prevented TPA-induced phosphorylation and catalytic activity of p38 mitogen-activated protein (MAP) kinase that regulates COX-2 expression in mouse skin. The p38 MAP kinase inhibitor SB203580 attenuated NF-κB activation and subsequent COX-2 induction in TPA-treated mouse skin. Taken together, our data suggest that [6]-gingerol inhibits TPA-induced COX-2 expression in mouse skin in vivo by blocking the p38 MAP kinase-NF-κB signaling pathway."

https://openalex.org/W2060300682,"The β-catenin protein is at the core of the canonical Wnt signalling pathway. Wnt stimulation leads to β-catenin accumulation, nuclear translocation and interaction with T-cell factor/lymphoid enhancer factor (TCF/LEF) transcription factors to regulate genes important for embryonic development and proliferation. Wnt/β-catenin can promote stem cell self-renewal and is dysregulated in colon carcinoma. We have examined the role of the Wnt pathway in the development of acute myeloid leukaemia (AML) and find that the β-catenin protein is readily detected in primary AML samples. Using transfection of a TCF/LEF reporter construct into primary AML cells and normal human progenitors, we find increased reporter activity in 16/25 leukaemia samples. Retrovirally mediated expression of a mutant active β-catenin in normal progenitors preserves CD34 expression and impairs myelomonocytic differentiation. Activation of TCF/LEF signalling decreases factor withdrawal-induced apoptosis of normal progenitors. A significant proportion of AML cases show aberrant expression of components of the Wnt pathway including Wnt-1, Wnt-2b and LEF-1. These results provide evidence for the involvement of the Wnt/β-catenin pathway in the pathogenesis of AML."
https://openalex.org/W2089677512,"The post-translational modifications ubiquitination and sumoylation have been implicated in regulating many critical cellular pathways. Like ubiquitination, sumoylation is a multistep process involving maturation, activation, conjugation and deconjugation. Ubc9 is a sole E2-conjugating enzyme essential for sumoylation. We have previously shown that alterations of Ubc9 expression affect tumor drug responsiveness. However, it is not clear whether there is any link between sumoylation and tumorigenesis, even though alterations of the ubiquitination pathway can lead to the development of cancer. In this study, we found that Ubc9 expression levels were elevated in ovarian tumors compared to the matched normal ovarian specimens, suggesting that Ubc9 may play a role in tumorigenesis. To test this, we overexpressed a dominant-negative mutant of Ubc9 (Ubc9-DN) and wild-type Ubc9 (Ubc9-WT) in the MCF-7 human breast tumor cells. Inoculating these cells as xenografts in mice revealed that tumors expressing Ubc9-WT grew better than the vector control, while tumors expressing Ubc9-DN exhibited reduced growth. This pattern was also seen in these cells when grown in culture. To better understand the mechanism behind this observation, we profiled gene expressions in these cells by microarray analysis and found alterations in expression of the pro-oncogene bcl-2 in these Ubc9-DN- and Ubc9-WT-expressing cells. Consistent with the bcl-2 results, subsequent studies revealed a higher rate of apoptosis and poor survival for the MCF-7 cells expressing Ubc9-DN, which are associated with downregulation of bcl-2. Together, these results suggest a role for Ubc9 in tumorigenesis at least partially through regulation of bcl-2 expression."
https://openalex.org/W2059650806,"Poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase-1 (PARP-1) is an intracellular sensor of DNA strand breaks and plays a critical role in cellular responses to DNA damage. In normally functioning cells, PARP-1 enzymatic activity has been linked to the alterations in chromatin structure associated with gene expression. However, the molecular determinants for PARP-1 recruitment to specific sites in chromatin in the absence of DNA strand breaks remain obscure. Using gel shift and enzymatic footprinting assays and atomic force microscopy, we show that PARP-1 recognizes distortions in the DNA helical backbone and that it binds to three- and four-way junctions as well as to stably unpaired regions in double-stranded DNA. PARP-1 interactions with non-B DNA structures are functional and lead to its catalytic activation. DNA hairpins, cruciforms, and stably unpaired regions are all effective co-activators of PARP-1 auto-modification and poly(ADP-ribosyl)ation of histone H1 in the absence of free DNA ends. Enzyme kinetic analyses revealed that the structural features of non-B form DNA co-factors are important for PARP-1 catalysis activated by undamaged DNA. K0.5 constants for DNA co-factors, which are structurally different in the degree of base pairing and spatial DNA organization, follow the order: cruciform ≤ hairpin « loop. DNA structure also influenced the reaction rate; when a hairpin was substituted with a stably unpaired region, the maximum reaction velocity decreased almost 2-fold. These data suggest a link between PARP-1 binding to non-B DNA structures in genome and its function in the dynamics of local modulation of chromatin structure in the normal physiology of the cell."
https://openalex.org/W2041236391,"The current study tests the hypothesis that chronic atrophic gastritis from hypochlorhydria in the gastrin-deficient mouse predisposes the stomach to gastric cancer. Gross morphology and histology of 12-month-old wild-type (WT), gastrin-deficient (G-/-) and somatostatin-deficient (SOM-/-) mice were examined. Parietal and G cells, Ki67, TUNEL, villin and MUC2 expression were analysed by immunohistochemistry. RUNX3 and STAT3 expression was analysed by Western blot. Anchorage-independent growth was determined by cell cluster formation in soft agar. Compared to the WT and SOM-/- mice, hypochlorhydric G-/- mice developed parietal cell atrophy, significant antral inflammation and intestinal metaplasia. Areas of metaplasia within the G-/- mouse stomach showed decreased RUNX3 expression with elevated MUC2 and villin expression. Cells isolated from the tumor grew in soft agar. However, the cells isolated from WT, nontransformed G-/- and SOM-/- gastric tissue did not form colonies in soft agar. Consistent with elevated antral proliferation, tumor tissue isolated from the G-/- mice showed elevated phosphorylated STAT3 expression. We then examined the mechanism by which STAT3 was constitutively expressed in the tumor tissue of the G-/- mice. We found that IFNgamma expression was also significantly higher in the tumor tissue of G-/- mice compared to WT and SOM-/- animals. To determine whether STAT3 was regulated by IFNgamma, MKN45 cells were cocultured with IFNgamma or gastrin. IFNgamma significantly stimulated phosphorylation of STAT3 in the MKN45 cell line, but not gastrin. Therefore, we show here that in the hypochlorhydric mouse stomach, the chronic gastritis, atrophy, metaplasia, dysplasia paradigm can be recapitulated in mice. Moreover, neoplastic transformation of the antral gastric mucosa does not require gastrin."
https://openalex.org/W1997145609,"Mutations of parkin, a protein-ubiquitin isopeptide ligase (E3), appear to be the most frequent cause of familial Parkinson's disease (PD). Our previous studies have demonstrated that parkin binds strongly to α/β tubulin heterodimers and microtubules. Here we show that the strong binding between parkin and tubulin, as well as that between parkin and microtubules, was mediated by three independent domains: linker, RING1, and RING2. These redundant strong interactions made it virtually impossible to separate parkin from microtubules by high concentrations of salt (3.8 m) or urea (0.5 m).

Among the PD-linked genes identified so far, parkin is the most prevalent genetic factor causing familial Parkinson's disease; its mutations account for up to 50% of recessive PD cases (3Dekker M.C.

Zhao J.H. Feng J. J. Neurosci. 2003; 23: 3316-3324Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The involvement of tubulin and microtubules in PD has been implicated in many previous reports. Tubulin is a major component of Lewy bodies (13Galloway P.G. Mulvihill P. Perry G. Am. J. Pathol. 1992; 140: 809-822PubMed Google Scholar), which are intracytoplasmic inclusions enriched in ubiquitinated proteins (14Leroy E. Boyer R. Auburger G. Leube B. Ulm G. Mezey E. Harta G. Brownstein M.J. Jonnalagada S. Chernova T. Dehejia A. Lavedan C. Gasser T. Steinbach P.J. Wilkinson K.D. Polymeropoulos M.H. Nature. 1998; 395: 451-452Crossref PubMed Scopus (1372) Google Scholar). It suggests that ubiquitinated tubulin may be present in Lewy bodies. Consistent with this, parkin, ubiquitinated proteins, and acetylated α-tubulin are accumulated in the aggresome in a microtubule-dependent manner when protein degradation through the 26 S proteasome is inhibited (15Zhao J. Ren Y. Jiang Q. Feng J. J. Cell Sci. 2003; 116: 4011-4019Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar, 16Ardley H.C. Scott G.B. Rose S.A. Tan N.G. Markham A.F. Robinson P.A. Mol. Biol.

On the other hand, 1-methyl-4-phenylpyridinium (MPP+) and rotenone, two neurotoxins known to cause PD-like symptoms in animal models, potently depolymerize microtubules (17Cappelletti G. Maggioni M.G. Maci R. J Neurosci. Res. 1999; 56: 28-35Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar, 18Cappelletti G. Pedrotti B. Maggioni M.G. Maci R. Cell Biol.

Microtubule depolymerization induces tubulin degradation at both protein (21Drubin D. Kobayashi S. Kellogg D. Kirschner M. J. Cell Biol. 1988; 106: 1583-1591Crossref PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar) and RNA levels (22Cleveland D.W. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1989; 1: 10-14Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). Because parkin is an E3 ligase of tubulin (11Ren Y. Zhao J.H. Feng J. J. Neurosci. 2003; 23: 3316-3324Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), its ability to ubiquitinate tubulin dissociated from microtubules by these PD toxins may at least be partly responsible for this rapid degradation of tubulin. Parkin exhibits a punctate subcellular localization along microtubules in a variety of cells, including neurons (11Ren Y. Zhao J.H. Feng J. J. Neurosci. 2003; 23: 3316-3324Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Apart from its E3 ligase activity on tubulin, the strong binding between parkin and microtubules may anchor this E3 ligase on microtubules to serve its functions, as misfolded proteins are known to be transported along microtubules to the aggresome (23Kopito R.R. Trends Cell Biol. 2000; 10: 524-530Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1583) Google Scholar).To understand the molecular determinants of the strong interaction between parkin and tubulin/microtubules, we mapped the domains of parkin that were responsible for this tight binding. Of the five functional domains of parkin, Linker, RING1, or RING2 were able to bind to tubulin and microtubules with high affinity, whereas the ubiquitin-like (Ubl) domain or In-between RING finger (IBR) domain did not have such abilities. Thus, three domains of parkin independently provided tight binding to tubulin and microtubules. Such strong, redundant interactions rendered it almost impossible to separate parkin from microtubules and tubulin. Parkin remained bound to microtubules in the presence of 3.8 m NaCl or 0.5 m urea. It always co-purified with tubulin in ion exchange or gel filtration chromatography and was found in highly purified tubulin preparation (>99% purity).Expression of the domains that bound to tubulin and microtubules significantly reduced colchicine-induced microtubule depolymerization, suggesting that parkin may stabilize the microtubule network. We also found that PD-linked mutations of parkin (K161N, T240R, and C431F) did not significantly impair the binding of parkin with tubulin heterodimers or microtubules, nor did they affect the ability of parkin to stabilize microtubules against colchicine-induced depolymerization. Thus, the strong binding of parkin to microtubules may stabilize the microtubule network and anchor this E3 ligase to effectively ubiquitinate misfolded proteins being transported along microtubules.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESAntibodies and cDNAs—A polyclonal antibody against parkin was generated previously. It recognizes only the correct band on Western blots (11Ren Y. Zhao J.H. Feng J. J. Neurosci. 2003; 23: 3316-3324Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Monoclonal antibodies against α-tubulin (DM1A) and FLAG (M2) were purchased from Sigma. Polyclonal FLAG antibody used in the immunocytochemistry was purchased from Cayman Chemical (Ann Arbor, MI). Rhodamine- or fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated secondary antibodies were purchased from Santa Cruz Biotechnology (Santa Cruz, CA). Human parkin cDNA was amplified by reverse transcription PCR from SH-SY5Y cells and was completely sequenced to ensure that no mistake was introduced by PCR. It was subcloned into pCMV-Tag2B (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA), which added a FLAG tag at the N terminus of the protein produced. Point mutants of parkin were generated by site-directed mutagenesis using the QuikChange kit (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA). The mutant constructs were confirmed by DNA sequencing. cDNAs for different domains of parkin were obtained by PCR reactions using the full-length human parkin construct as the template. The cDNA sequences encoding amino acids 1–76 (Ubl), 77–237 (Linker), 217–310 (RING1 or R1), 395–465 (RING2 or R2), 1–237 (Ubl-Linker), 307–465 (IBR-R2), and 217–465 (RIR) of parkin were cloned into pCMV-Tag2B vector between BamHI and SalI sites to generate FLAG-tagged constructs. The cDNA sequences encoding amino acids 307–405 (In-between RING, IBR) and 217–405 (R1-IBR) were cloned into pCMV-Tag2B vector between BamHI and HindIII sites. The cDNAs for these parkin domains tagged with N-terminal FLAG in pCMV-Tag2B vector were further subcloned into pcDNA3.1(+)/hygro vector (Invitrogen) using NotI and ApaI restriction sites. Expression levels of these FLAG-tagged constructs in pcDNA3.1 vector were higher than in pCMV-Tag2B vector and were thus used in all experiments. All constructs in the pcDNA3.1 vector were verified by sequencing.Cell Culture, Transfection, Immunoprecipitation, and Western Blot— HEK293T cell line was maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% bovine fetal calf serum and antibiotics. Transient transfections of various constructs were performed by the calcium phosphate method (12Jiang H. Jiang Q. Feng J. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 54380-54386Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). Thirty hours after transfection, cells cultured in 10-cm dishes were lysed on ice in cold lysis buffer (1% Triton X-100, 10 mm Tris, pH 7.6, 50 mm NaCl, 30 mm sodium pyrophosphate, 50 mm NaF, 5 mm EDTA, and 0.1 mm Na3VO4) for 20 min. Lysates were centrifuged at 16,000 × g at 4 °C, and the supernatant fraction was incubated with antibody against α-tubulin for 6 h at 4 °C, followed by incubation with protein A/G plus agarose (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) under the same conditions. Immunoprecipitates were washed three times with the lysis buffer, boiled in 2 × SDS loading buffer for 5 min, followed by separation on SDS-polyacrylamide gel and analysis by Western blots with FLAG antibody. Western blots were carried out using the ECL method according to the manufacturer's protocol (Amersham Biosciences).Taxol-mediated Microtubule Co-assembly Assay—Different domains of parkin were transfected in three 10-cm dishes (eight dishes for the R1 domain) of HEK293T cells with the calcium phosphate method. Thirty hours after transfection, each dish of cells was washed twice with PBS and incubated in 0.5 ml of PEM buffer (0.1 m PIPES, 1 mm EGTA, 1 mm MgSO4 with protease inhibitor mixture tablet and 1% phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride) on ice for 10 min. The cells were homogenized on ice in a tissue grinder (Fisher Scientific). Three-week-old male Sprague-Dawley rats were decapitated after being anesthetized with halothane (Sigma). One half of a rat brain was homogenized for 30 min on ice with the HEK293 cell lysates containing various domains of parkin. After incubation on ice for 15 min, the homogenates were centrifuged at 30,000 × g at 4 °C for 15 min, and ultracentrifuged at 180,000 × g at 4 °C for 90 min. The supernatant was designated C (cytosol) fraction. Taxol (Sigma) and GTP were added to C fraction to a final concentration of 20 μm and 1 mm, respectively. The solution was incubated at 37 °C for 15 min and centrifuged at 30,000 × g through a layer of PEM buffer with 10% sucrose at 37 °C for 30 min. The supernatant was designated S1. The pellet was washed with PEM buffer and resuspended in PEM buffer containing GTP and taxol at 37 °C (P1), which was centrifuged again. The supernatant was designated S2, the pellet was washed with PEM buffer again and resuspended in PEM buffer with GTP but without taxol at 37 °C (P2). P2 was mixed with an appropriate volume of MAP dissociation buffer (PEM buffer with GTP, but without taxol, plus 4 m NaCl) and incubated at 37 °C for 45 min to elute MAPs to the supernatant fraction at 2 or 3.8 m of NaCl. After the mixtures were centrifuged (30,000 × g, 30 min, 37 °C), supernatant S3 and pellet P3 were obtained. P3 was rinsed in PEM buffer (without taxol or GTP) at 37 °C and resuspended in PEM buffer at 4 °C to depolymerize microtubules. Equal amount of total proteins (10 μg for parkin blot and 2 μg for tubulin blot) from each fraction were boiled and separated by SDS-PAGE and analyzed by Western blotting with antibodies against FLAG, parkin, or α-tubulin, respectively.Chromatographic Purification of Parkin-tubulin Complex—The microtubule pellet after elution with 2 m NaCl was rinsed and resuspended in PEM buffer without GTP or Taxol (P3), and incubated on ice for 1 h.P3 was then dialyzed (in Slide-A-Lyzer Dialysis Cassette, Pierce) overnight against ion exchange buffer (10 mm NaCl, 25 mm Tris, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 1 mm EDTA, pH 7.5). The dialyzed sample was centrifuged at 16,000 × g for 10 min at 4 °C, and the supernatant was injected to an anion exchange chromatographic column (Mono Q, HR 5/5, 1 ml, Amersham Biosciences) at 4 °C. The elution buffer gradient was 10 mm to 1 m NaCl. Equal volume of protein-enriched fractions was loaded for SDS-PAGE and analyzed by Western blotting with antibodies against parkin or α-tubulin. Fractions containing parkin-tubulin complex after Mono Q were collected and applied to a gel filtration column (Superose 12, HR 10/30, 24 ml, Amersham Biosciences) equilibrated in 25 mm Tris, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 100 mm NaCl, pH 7.0, at 4 °C. The fractions were analyzed by Western blotting as described above. Both chromatographic purification steps were run on AKTA fast protein liquid chromatography instrument (Amersham Biosciences).Immunocytochemistry—COS-7 cells were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium with 10% bovine fetal calf serum and antibiotics. Transient transfections of various constructs were performed using FuGENE 6 (Roche Applied Science) according to the manufacturer's protocol. Sixteen hours after transfection, cells were re-plated and grown on coverslips (pre-coated with poly-d-lysine) in 12-well plates for 12–16 h. After the cells were treated with 1 μm colchicine for 12 h, they were fixed and co-stained with anti-FLAG (rabbit polyclonal) and anti-α-tubulin (mouse monoclonal) in methods used previously (11Ren Y. Zhao J.H. Feng J. J. Neurosci. 2003; 23: 3316-3324Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Images were acquired under a 60× lenses of a Nikon fluorescence microscope with a charge-coupled device camera (Diagnostic Instrument, Sterling Heights, MI) and merged using the SPOT software (Diagnostic Instrument). For quantification of microtubule-containing (MT+) cells, at least 200 transfected cells or 500 untransfected cells from four coverslips were counted in separate experiments. The percentage of cells with at least one visible microtubule was calculated for each condition.Measurement of Free Tubulin in the Cell—Free tubulin was extracted essentially as described previously (24Joshi H.C. Cleveland D.W. J. Cell Biol. 1989; 109: 663-673Crossref PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar). Briefly, HEK293T cells transfected without or with various constructs were treated without or with colchicine (1 μm) for 40 min at 37 °C in culture media. Cells were washed twice at 37 °C with 1 ml of Buffer A containing 0.1 m MES (pH 6.75), 1 mm MgSO4, 2 mm EGTA, 0.1 mm EDTA, and 4 m glycerol. After the cultures were incubated at 37 °C for 5 min in free tubulin extraction buffer (Buffer A plus 0.1% Triton X-100 and protease inhibitors), the extracts were centrifuged at 37 °C for 2 min at 16,000 × g. The supernatant fractions contained free tubulin extracted from the cytosol. Equal amounts of total proteins from the supernatant fractions were analyzed by Western blotting with anti-α-tubulin (Sigma). The intensity of tubulin bands was quantified from three different experiments with the software NIH imaging. Total cell lysates in a lysis buffer (1% Triton X-100, 10 mm Tris, pH 7.6, 50 mm NaCl, 30 mm sodium pyrophosphate, 50 mm NaF, 5 mm EDTA, and 0.1 mm Na3VO4) were blotted with anti-FLAG or anti-HA to assess expression levels of transfected constructs.RESULTSThree Domains of Parkin Independently Binds to α/β-Tubulin Heterodimers—To understand the molecular determinants for the strong interaction between parkin and tubulin (11Ren Y. Zhao J.H. Feng J. J. Neurosci. 2003; 23: 3316-3324Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), we generated a series of constructs expressing various domains of parkin to identify the tubulin-binding region(s). All of these constructs (Fig. 1A) were tagged with FLAG at the N terminus and could be efficiently expressed in HEK293T cells, except for the RING1 domain, whose expression level was much lower than that of the others (Fig. 1, B and C).We first examined the ability of each individual domain of parkin to co-immunoprecipitate endogenous α/β-tubulin. HEK293 cells transfected without or with these domains or empty vector were lysed at 4 °C in a buffer containing 1% Triton X-100. After centrifugation, cleared cell lysates were immunoprecipitated with an antibody against α-tubulin at 4 °C. Anti-FLAG blot of α-tubulin immunoprecipitates and 1% of the input lysates showed that the Linker (L), RING1 (R1), or RING2 (R2) domain was strongly co-immunoprecipitated with tubulin. In contrast, the ubiquitin-like (Ubl or U) domain or In-between RING finger (IBR or I) domain was not co-immunoprecipitated with α-tubulin (Fig. 1B). Similar results were obtained when we perform the same experiments in the presence of 25 μm colchicine (data not shown). This is consistent with our previous result that the binding between parkin and tubulin α/β heterodimer is not affected by colchicine (11Ren Y. Zhao J.H. Feng J. J. Neurosci. 2003; 23: 3316-3324Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and suggests that each of the three domains (Linker, RING1, and RING2) binds to tubulin heterodimer at 4 °C. Although the RING1 domain was expressed at a much lower level, its ability to co-immunoprecipitate with tubulin was commensurate with its expression.To confirm these observations, we expressed combinations of various parkin domains in HEK293T cells and performed the same co-immunoprecipitation assays with anti-α-tubulin. As shown in Fig. 1C, the UL constructs, which covered Ubl and Linker domains, was strongly co-immunoprecipitated with tubulin. So were the RIR (RING1-IBR-RING2), RI (RING1-IBR), or IR (IBR-RING2) constructs. As long as a construct included one of the tubulin-binding domains (Linker, RING1, or RING2), it exhibited strong co-immunoprecipitation with α/β-tubulin. Thus, the Ubl or IBR domain did not interfere with the tubulin-binding activity of Linker, RING1, or RING2.The Three Tubulin-binding Domains of Parkin Also Strongly Associate with Microtubules—Because our previous study has shown the strong binding between parkin and microtubules in taxol-mediate microtubule co-assembly assays (11Ren Y. Zhao J.H. Feng J. J. Neurosci. 2003; 23: 3316-3324Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), we wondered whether the interaction was mediated by the three tubulin-binding domains of parkin. To test this, we combined lysates of HEK293T cells expressing individual parkin domains with rat brain homogenates, which were used as a rich source of tubulin. After ultracentrifugation of the mixed lysates at 4 °C, the supernatant fraction was used in taxol-mediated microtubule co-assembly experiments. The pellet fraction after two cycles of co-assembly (P2) was incubated in MAP dissociation buffer containing 2 m NaCl to assess the binding affinity between parkin domains and microtubules.As shown in Fig. 2, α-tubulin was highly enriched in the pellet fractions containing microtubules (P1, P2, and P3), compared with the soluble fractions (S1, S2, and S3). Consistent with our previous result, endogenous parkin from rat brain (and negligible amount of endogenous parkin from HEK293T cells) was found exclusively in the pellet fractions (11Ren Y. Zhao J.H. Feng J. J. Neurosci. 2003; 23: 3316-3324Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Under the same condition, we found that Linker or RING1 (R1) domain was always in the pellet fraction with microtubules, even in the presence of 2 m NaCl. The RING2 (R2) domain exhibited partial co-assembly with microtubules. In contrast, the Ubl or IBR domain was in the S1 fraction, unable to co-assemble with microtubules. We also tested constructs that expressed combinations of various parkin domains. IBR-R2, Ubl-Linker, or R1-IBR was able to strongly co-assemble with microtubules. Thus, as long as the combined construct contained one of the tubulin-binding domains (Linker, R1, or R2), it co-assembled with microtubules. Because IBR itself did not co-assemble with microtubules at all, the ability of IBR-R2 to bind to microtubules most likely comes from R2. It seems that there might be some structural hindrance that affects the efficient binding of R2 with microtubules, which appears to be removed when R2 is in the context of IBR-R2, as in the native sequence of parkin. Together, these results suggest that the three tubulin-binding domains of parkin also mediate its strong association with microtubules.Fig. 2Strong binding between three domains of parkin and microtubules. HEK293T cells overexpressing different domains of parkin were homogenized in PEM buffer. Rat brain were added to the cell lysates and homogenized further with the HEK293T cell lysate. The cytosolic fraction (C) from ultracentrifuged homogenates was subjected to two cycles of taxol-mediated microtubule assembly assays. The third cycle was done in the presence of 2 m NaCl without taxol. Supernatant and pellet fractions from each cycle were designated as S1, P1, S2, P2, S3, and P3, respectively. Equal amounts of total proteins from each fraction (2 μg for α-tubulin blot, 10 μg for the rest) were analyzed by Western blotting with antibodies against α-tubulin, parkin, or FLAG. Endogenous parkin and tubulin were always in microtubule fraction in the pellet. Exogenously expressed Linker, R1, IBR-R2, Ubl-Linker, and R1-IBR constructs strongly co-assembled with microtubules, whereas the R2 domain co-assembled with microtubules to a lesser degree. Ubl or IBR domains did not co-assemble with microtubules. All experiments were repeated at least three times with similar results.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Parkin Cannot Be Dissociated from Microtubules with High Concentrations of NaCl or Urea—To assess the affinity between parkin and microtubules, we performed the taxol-mediated microtubule co-assembly assay and incubated microtubules in the P2 pellet in MAP dissociation buffer (PEM buffer plus GTP, but no taxol) containing 2 or 3.8 m of NaCl for 45 min at 37 °C. After centrifugation, the supernatant and pellet fractions were designated as S3 and P3 (for 2 m NaCl wash) and S4 and P4 (for 3.8 m NaCl wash), respectively. As shown in Fig. 3A, parkin still remained in the pellet fraction with microtubules even in the presence of 3.8 m NaCl.Fig. 3Extremely tight binding between parkin and microtubules.A, after two cycles of taxol-mediated microtubule assembly, which produced fractions S1, P1, S2 and P2, microtubules in the pellet fraction P2 were incubated with 2 or 3.8 NaCl in PEM buffer at 37 °C for 45 min. After centrifugation, supernatant fractions were designated as S3 and S4, whereas pellet fractions (P3 and P4) were resuspended in PEM buffer on ice for 30 min to dissociate microtubules. Western blotting of equal amounts of total proteins from each fraction (2 μg for tubulin blot and 10 μg for parkin blot) showed that parkin remained in the pellet fraction with microtubules even in the presence of 3.8 m NaCl. B, the pellet fraction P2 was resuspended and separated into five equal parts, each incubated at 37 °C for 45 min in PEM buffer containing 0.5, 1, 1.5, 2, or 4 m urea, respectively. Western blotting of equal amounts of total proteins from each fraction (2 μg for tubulin blot and 10 μg for parkin blot) showed that parkin was eluted from the pellet into the supernatant fraction with urea at or above 1 m. C, microtubules in the pellet fraction P3 from A were dialyzed overnight at 4 °C against ion exchange purification buffer (10 mm NaCl, 20 mm sodium phosphate, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 1 mm EDTA, pH 7.5) and centrifuged to obtain clear supernatant, which were separated by ion exchange chromatography with a NaCl gradient from 10 mm to 1 m at 4 °C. Western blotting of equal fractions of the eluted samples with antibodies against parkin or α-tubulin showed that parkin co-purified with tubulin. D, purified tubulin (>99% purity) from a commercial source (Cytoskeleton, Inc., Denver, CO) was analyzed by Western blotting with antibodies against α-tubulin, β-tubulin, or parkin, respectively. The amounts of total protein loaded on the gel were 0.1, 0.1, or 1 μg for each blot, respectively. Parkin was detected in purified tubulin. All experiments were repeated for at least three times with similar results.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)To separate parkin from microtubules, we resorted to urea and incubated microtubules in the P2 pellet with MAP dissociation buffer containing 0.5–4 m urea for 45 min at 37 °C.

https://openalex.org/W2053445935,"Multiple myeloma (MM) is the most common form of plasma cell dyscrasia, characterized by a marked heterogeneity of genetic lesions and clinical course. It may develop from a premalignant condition (monoclonal gammopathy of undetermined significance, MGUS) or progress from intramedullary to extramedullary forms (plasma cell leukemia, PCL). To provide insights into the molecular characterization of plasma cell dyscrasias and to investigate the contribution of specific genetic lesions to the biological and clinical heterogeneity of MM, we analysed the gene expression profiles of plasma cells isolated from seven MGUS, 39 MM and six PCL patients by means of DNA microarrays. MMs resulted highly heterogeneous at transcriptional level, whereas the differential expression of genes mainly involved in DNA metabolism and proliferation distinguished MGUS from PCLs and the majority of MM cases. The clustering of MM patients was mainly driven by the presence of the most recurrent translocations involving the immunoglobulin heavy-chain locus. Distinct gene expression patterns have been found to be associated with different lesions: the overexpression of CCND2 and genes involved in cell adhesion pathways was observed in cases with deregulated MAF and MAFB, whereas genes upregulated in cases with the t(4;14) showed apoptosis-related functions. The peculiar finding in patients with the t(11;14) was the downregulation of the α-subunit of the IL-6 receptor. In addition, we identified a set of cancer germline antigens specifically expressed in a subgroup of MM patients characterized by an aggressive clinical evolution, a finding that could have implications for patient classification and immunotherapy."

https://openalex.org/W2141956007,"Abnormal signalling events mediated by receptor tyrosine kinases (RTKs) contribute to human carcinogenesis. Sprouty2 (Spry2) is a key antagonistic regulator of RTK signalling and suppression of its expression or function may facilitate proliferation and angiogenesis. Using prostate cancer (CaP) as a model, we investigated the significance of Spry2 in human malignancy. We observed downregulated Spry2 expression in invasive CaP cell lines and high-grade clinical CaP (compared to benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH) and well-differentiated tumours, P=0.041). A large CpG island is associated with hSPRY2, and extensive hypermethylation of this CpG island was observed in 76–82% of high-grade CaP, while control BPH tissues were predominantly unmethylated (P=0.0005). Furthermore, suppressed Spry2 expression correlated with methylation of the CpG region in clinical samples (P=0.004) and treatment with 5-aza-2′-deoxycytidine reactivated Spry2 expression in LNCaP and PC-3M cells. hSPRY2 maps to the long arm of chromosome 13 (13q31.1), where loss of heterozygosity (LOH) has been reported. We found no evidence of mutation; however, we demonstrated 27–40% LOH using flanking markers to hSPRY2. Hence, while biallelic epigenetic inactivation of hSPRY2 represents the main genetic event in prostate carcinogenesis, the observed 27–40% LOH presents evidence of hemizygous deletion with the remaining allele hypermethylated. We therefore propose hSPRY2 as a potential tumour suppressor locus in CaP."
https://openalex.org/W2063477340,"Signaling through Toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4) is thought to initiate innate and adaptive immune responses. Signaling of TLR4 is usually studied using isolated cells, which are activated by sub-nanomolar concentrations of lipopolysaccharide (LPS). However, in normal tissues, cells bearing TLR4 reside in microenvironments containing large amounts of endogenous substances that can stimulate the receptor. We developed an in vitro model system using the human cell line HEK 293 and an in vivo model using mice that have normal or that lack TLR4 receptors to study how TLR4 functions in such microenvironments. Here we report that signaling through TLR4 is strongly inhibited by intact extracellular matrix and that inhibition is abrogated and endogenous agonist(s) are liberated when the matrix is degraded. Thus, release from inhibition rather than direct stimulation by agonists such as LPS is the critical first event by which TLR4 initiates immune responses."
https://openalex.org/W1998141927,"Homologs of BT1 (the Brittle1 protein) are found to be phylogenetically related to the mitochondrial carrier family and appear to occur in both mono- and dicotyledonous plants. Whereas BT1 from cereals is probably involved in the transport of ADP-glucose, which is essential for starch metabolism in endosperm plastids, BT1 from a noncereal plant, Solanum tuberosum (StBT1), catalyzes an adenine nucleotide uniport when functionally integrated into the bacterial cytoplasmic membrane. Import studies into intact Escherichia coli cells harboring StBT1 revealed a narrow substrate spectrum with similar affinities for AMP, ADP, and ATP of about 300–400 μm. Transiently expressed StBT1-green fluorescent protein fusion protein in tobacco leaf protoplasts showed a plastidic localization of the StBT1. In vitro synthesized radioactively labeled StBT1 was targeted to the envelope membranes of isolated spinach chloroplasts. Furthermore, we showed by real time reverse transcription-PCR a ubiquitous expression pattern of the StBT1 in autotrophic and heterotrophic potato tissues.

Plastids are semiautonomous plant organelles existing in a wide range of differential forms depending on the developmental stage and function of the cells in which they reside. They are the sites of photosynthesis and harbor exclusively many biosynthetic pathways such as synthesis of starch and amino and fatty acids (1Neuhaus H.E. Emes M.J. Annu. Rev. Plant Physiol. Plant Mol. Biol. 2000; 51: 111-140Crossref PubMed Scopus (486) Google Scholar). The surrounding envelopes, especially the inner envelope, effectively separate plastid metabolism from the cytosol. Communication between plastids and the surrounding cytosol is mediated by a large group of phylogenetically related phosphate translocators (2Flügge U.I. Annu. Rev. Plant Physiol. Plant Mol. Biol. 1999; 50: 27-45Crossref PubMed Scopus (182) Google Scholar, 3Knappe S. Flugge U.I. Fischer K. Plant Physiol. 2003; 131: 1178-1190Crossref PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar). The daily fixed carbon is exported from chloroplasts as triose phosphates and 3-phosphoglycerate via the triose phosphate/phosphate translocator (4Flügge U.I. Fischer K. Gross A. Sebald W. Lottspeich F. Eckerskorn C. EMBO J. 1989; 8: 39-46Crossref PubMed Scopus (202) Google Scholar). The phosphoenolpyruvate/phosphate translocator provides the plastids with phosphoenolpyruvate as immediate precursors for the shikimic acid pathway (5Fischer K. Kammerer B. Gutensohn M. Arbinger B. Weber A. Häusler R. Flügge U.I. Plant Cell. 1997; 9: 453-462Crossref PubMed Scopus (197) Google Scholar). The pentose phosphate/phosphate translocator (xylulose 5-phosphate) represents a link between the cytosolic and plastidic pentose phosphate pathway (6Eicks M. Maurino V. Knappe S. Flügge U.I. Fischer K. Plant Physiol. 2002; 128: 512-522Crossref PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar). Plastids of nonphotosynthetic tissues have to import carbon to fuel biosynthetic pathways (for example, fatty acid, amino acid, or starch synthesis) via the glucose 6-phosphate/phosphate translocator (7Kammerer B. Fischer K. Hilpert B. Schubert S. Gutensohn M. Weber A. Flügge U.I. Plant Cell. 1998; 10: 105-117Crossref PubMed Scopus (252) Google Scholar). All of the members of the plastidic phosphate translocators(s) function as antiport systems and belong to the group of translocators with a 6 + 6 helix (homodimer) folding pattern (8Wagner R. Apley E.C. Gross A. Flügge U.I. Eur. J. Biochem. 1989; 182: 165-173Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). In this respect, the plastidic phosphate translocators differ from several other transporters of the plastidic envelope membrane, which function as monomers that contain 12 transmembrane helices. These include a maltose transporter that exports maltose, the product of hydrolytic starch degradation (9Niittyla T. Messerli G. Trevisan M. Chen J. Smith A.M. Zeeman S.C. Science. 2004; 303: 87-89Crossref PubMed Scopus (365) Google Scholar), two dicarboxylate translocators that are involved in ammonia assimilation (10Weber A. Flügge U.I. J. Exp.

Another prominent plastidic 12-helix transporter is the ATP/ADP transporter (NTT) 1The abbreviations used are: NTT, nucleotide transporter; ADP-Glc, ADP-glucose; MCF, mitochondrial carrier family; GFP, green fluorescent protein; RT, reverse transcription; AGPase, ADP-Glc pyrophosphorylase; IPTG, isopropyl β-d-thiogalactopyranoside; HPLC, high pressure liquid chromatography. that supplies plastids with energy for the biosynthesis of starch, fatty acids, and other compounds (12Neuhaus H.E.

In intact amyloplasts from potato tubers, cauliflower buds, or developing pea and rape seed embryos, starch synthesis occurs via the uptake of hexose phosphates (1Neuhaus H.E. Emes M.J. Annu. Rev. Plant Physiol. Plant Mol. Biol. 2000; 51: 111-140Crossref PubMed Scopus (486) Google Scholar) mediated by the above mentioned hexose phosphate/phosphate antiporters.

Therefore, cytosolic ADP-glucose is the main precursor for starch synthesis in cereal endosperm plastids and is transported across the inner envelope membrane most likely in exchange for AMP (27Möhlmann T.

Physiological and immunological studies on the low starch Brittle1 mutant of maize (Zmbt1) lead to the common assumption that Zmbt1 encodes an ADP-Glc transporter, residing in the inner membrane of maize endosperm plastids (23Shannon J.C. Pien F.M. Cao H. Liu K.C. Plant Physiol. 1998; 117: 1235-1252Crossref PubMed Scopus (174) Google Scholar). In this mutant ADP-Glc accumulates in the endosperm of Zmbt1 kernels, although enzymatic activities of AGPase, UGPase, soluble starch synthase, soluble starch-branching enzyme, and sucrose synthase are not reduced compared with normal kernels (28Shannon J.C. Pien F-M. Liu K.C. Plant Physiol. 1996; 110: 835-843Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). In addition, intact amyloplasts of Zmbt1 mutant endosperms could only synthesize starch from exogenous ADP-Glc at 25% of the rate of wild type (29Liu T-T.Y. Boyer C.D. Shannon J.C. Plant Physiol. 1992; 99: S-39Crossref Scopus (41) Google Scholar), most probably because of the loss of four major amyloplastidic envelope polypeptides (39–44 kDa) detected by antibodies raised against ZmBT1 in normal kernels (30Cao H. Sullivan T.D. Boyer C.D. Shannon J.C. Physiol. Plant. 1995; 95: 176-186Crossref Scopus (60) Google Scholar). Similar physiological evidence was recently observed for low starch mutants of barley (lys5). These barley mutants also carry a defect in a major plastidic envelope protein, HvNST1, showing a high homology of ∼75% to the ZmBT1 (31Patron N.J. Greber B. Fahy B.F. Laurie D.A. Parker M.L.

Plant Cell. 1991; 3: 1337-1348Crossref PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar). Interestingly, BT1 homologs also occur in noncereal plants such as Solanum tuberosum (StBT1) and Arabidopsis thaliana (AtBT1) with a homology of about 65% to ZmBT1 and HvNST1. The lack of a cytosolic isoform of AGPase in the storage tissues of noncereal species (26Beckles D.M. Smith A.M. ap Rees R.T. Plant Physiol. 2001; 125: 818-827R.

The aim of this work was to gain insight into the nature and importance of the potato BT1 homolog (StBT1) from a dicotyledonous plant. For functional characterization of StBT1 we have used Escherichia coli for heterologous expression; this system has been previously shown to functionally integrate several plastidic, mitochondrial, and hydrogenosomal membrane proteins into the bacterial cytoplasmic membrane (20Tjaden J.

Hackstein J.H. Mol. Microbiol. 2004; 51: 1439-1446Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). We also investigated the tissue-specific expression and subcellular localization of the StBT1. Plant Growth—Potato plants (S. tuberosum L., cv Désirée) were grown in a greenhouse at 22–26 °C and watered once a day. The ambient light period was extended to 16 h/day with Philips Sont-Agro lights (200 μmol quanta × m-2 × s-1). To analyze the accumulation of mRNA encoding StBT1, potato tissues were collected 12–14 weeks after sprouting and immediately frozen in liquid nitrogen until use. Quantitative Real Time RT-PCR—Total RNA was prepared from various potato tissues using the RNeasy plant mini kit (Qiagen). To remove any contaminating DNA, the samples were treated with deoxyribonuclease (RNase-free DNase kit; Qiagen). Quantitative PCR was performed on the LightCycler (Roche Applied Science) using the QuantiTect™ SYBR Green RT-PCR kit (Qiagen) according to the manufacturer's instructions with the following cycler conditions: 20 min at 50 °C; 15 min at 95 °C; and 55 cycles of 15 s at 95 °C, 25 s at 58 °C, and 40 s at 72 °C. The sequences of the gene-specific oligonucleotides used for real time RT-PCR are the following: BT1-sense, 5′-CTGAGCTCTATAGAGGTCTCACTC-3′; BT1-antisense, 5′-AACATGAATCCCATCCTGTTCAAG-3′; EF-1α-sense, 5′-GTTTCACTGCC-CAGGTCATCATC-3′; and EF-1α-antisense, 5′TGGGCTTGGTGGGAATCATC-3′. The housekeeping gene in S. tuberosum encoding the elongation factor EF-1α (STU536671) was used for quantitative normalization. The specificity of the obtained RT-PCR products was controlled on 1.8% agarose gels. cDNA Constructs—DNA manipulations were performed essentially as described by Sambrook et al. (40Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar). The Stbt1 cDNA sequence (X98474) available at the EMBL data base (www.ebi.ac.uk/embl/) was used to design primers for PCR amplification in a way to cover the complete coding region. First strand cDNA from potato leaf tissue was used as PCR template. For construction of the E. coli expression plasmid (encoding His10-Stbt1), a sense primer including a NdeI restriction site (5′-GACTGAcatATGGCGGCGACAATG-3′; the lowercase letters indicate the introduced base exchange to create a NdeI restriction site) as well as an antisense primer (5′-CTACCTTCTTGGCCAAGAAC-3′) were selected, and the PCR took place in the presence of Pfu DNA polymerase (Stratagene, Heidelberg, Germany), which possesses a proof reading activity. The obtained PCR product was purified (QIAquick PCR purification kit; Qiagen) and subcloned into EcoRV-restricted pBSK (Stratagene). The NdeI/BamHI DNA insert of the pBSK plasmid was further introduced “in-frame” into the corresponding restriction sites of the isopropyl β-d-thiogalactopyranoside (IPTG)-inducible T7 RNA polymerase bacterial expression vector pET16b (Novagen, Heidelberg, Germany). The green fluorescent protein (GFP) fusion construct was prepared by amplification of the complete coding region of Stbt1 in the presence of Pfu DNA polymerase using 5′-GATTGATGGCTcGAgGGGATATAC-3′ and 5′-CTTCATTTTCTGCCTCgAgCAATATCCTCTTG-3′ as forward and reverse primers, respectively. Both primers included XhoI restriction sites for an in-frame insertion into pGFP2 (41Kost B. Spielhofer P. Chua N.H. Plant J. 1998; 16: 393-401Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The resulting plasmids were sequenced on both strands by chain termination reaction (Seqlab, Göttingen, Germany). Heterologous Expression of Stbt1 in E. coli—The E. coli strain BL21 (DE3) was used for heterologous expression. The cDNA sequence encoding StBT1 under control of the T7 promoter was transcribed after IPTG induction of the T7 RNA polymerase (42Studier F.W. Rosenberg A.H. Dunn J.J. Dubendorff J.W. Methods Enzymol. 1990; 185: 60-89Crossref PubMed Scopus (6006) Google Scholar). E. coli cells harboring the Stbt1 expression plasmid (or control expression plasmid pET16b) were grown at 37 °C in YTAmp/Clm medium (5 g/liter yeast extract, 8 g/liter peptone, 2.5 g/liter NaCl, pH 7.0). An A600 value of 0.5–0.6 was required for the initiation of T7 RNA polymerase expression by addition of IPTG (final concentration, 0.02%). The cells were grown for 1 h after induction and collected by centrifugation for 5 min at 5,000 × g (8 °C, Sorvall RC5B centrifuge, rotor type SS34; Sorvall-Du Pont, Dreieich, Germany). The pellet was resuspended to an A600 value of 8 using potassium phosphate buffer (50 mm, pH 7.0) (43Krause D.C. Winkler H.H. Wood D.O. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1985; 82: 3015-3019Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar) and promptly used for uptake experiments. Uptake of Radioactively Labeled ATP, ADP, and AMP into Intact E. coli Cells—IPTG-induced E. coli cells (100 μl) harboring the Stbt1 expression plasmid (or the given controls) were added to 100 μl of potassium phosphate buffer (50 mm, pH 7.0) containing radioactively labeled ATP, ADP, or AMP. [α-32P]ATP or ADP were used at specific activities between 50–500 μCi/μmol. [α-32P]ADP was enzymatically synthesized from [α-32P]ATP (PerkinElmer Life Sciences) as given in Tjaden et al. (20Tjaden J. Schwöppe C. Möhlmann T. Quick P.W. Neuhaus H.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 9630-9636Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). [14C]AMP was used at specific activities between 20 and 250 μCi/μmol. Uptake of nucleotides was carried out at 30 °C in an Eppendorf reaction vessel incubator and terminated after the indicated time periods by transferring the cells to a 0.45-μm membrane filter (mixed cellulose ester, 25-mm diameter; Schleicher & Schuell) under vacuum (44Winkler H.H. Methods Enzymol. 1986; 125: 253-259Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). The cells were further washed to remove unimported radioactivity by addition of 3 × 4 ml of potassium phosphate buffer (50 mm, pH 7.0). The filter was subsequently transferred into a 20-ml scintillation vessel and filled with either 10 ml of water or 10 ml of scintillation mixture (Quicksafe A; Zinsser Analytic, Frankfurt/Main, Germany). Radioactivity in the samples was quantified in a Canberra-Packard Tricarb 2500 scintillation counter (Canberra-Packard, Frankfurt/Main, Germany). For efflux assays, E. coli cells were incubated with potassium phosphate buffer (50 mm, pH 7.0) containing 5 μm [α-32P]ADP as a transport substrate. After indicated time periods, the uptake medium was diluted with several unlabeled nucleotides to a final concentration of 5 mm, and the efflux of [α-32P]ADP was monitored at given time points. Efflux was measured by membrane filtration as described above. To analyze the degree of metabolic conversion of imported [α-32P]ADP, we carried out a thin layer chromatography according to the method of Mangold (45Mangold H.K. Stahl E. Dünnschicht-Chromatographie: Ein Laboratoriumshandbuch. Springer, Heidelberg, Germany1967: 749-769Google Scholar). Transient Expression of GFP Fusion Constructs—Protoplasts were prepared from tobacco plants (Nicotiana tabacum cv. W38) grown under sterile conditions as given in Wendt et al. (46Wendt U.K. Wenderoth I. Tegeler A. Von S.A. Plant J. 2000; 23: 723-733Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The protoplasts were transformed with column-purified plasmid DNA (30 μg/0.5 × 106 cells). After 18 h of incubation in the dark at room temperature, the protoplasts were checked for green fluorescence using the Carl Zeiss Laser scanning system LSM510 (Carl Zeiss, Jena, Germany). GFP was excited at 488 nm, and emission was detected by a photomultiplier through a 505–530-nm bandpass filter using an Achroplan 40×/0.75 W objective. Targeting Experiments—The plasmid with the complete coding region of Stbt1 was used as a template for synthesis of the radioactively labeled precursor protein. Circular plasmid DNA was added to Promega TnT® kit reticulocyte lysate allowing coupled transcription and translation in the presence of [35S]methionine (Promega, Heidelberg, Germany). The in vitro synthesized 35S-labeled StBT1 precursor protein was used for import studies on isolated spinach mesophyll chloroplasts according to the method of Weber et al. (47Weber A. Menzlaff E. Arbinger B. Gutensohn M. Eckerskorn C. Flügge U.I. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 2621-2627Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar). Uptake of radioactively labeled StBT1 precursor protein was terminated after 20 min of incubation by removal of the incubation medium and subsequent thermolysin treatment as described by Weber et al. (47Weber A. Menzlaff E. Arbinger B. Gutensohn M. Eckerskorn C. Flügge U.I. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 2621-2627Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar). Fractionation of spinach chloroplasts into envelope membranes, stroma, and thylakoids was carried out as reported by Flügge et al. (4Flügge U.I. Fischer K. Gross A. Sebald W. Lottspeich F. Eckerskorn C. EMBO J. 1989; 8: 39-46Crossref PubMed Scopus (202) Google Scholar). The samples were subsequently analyzed by SDS-PAGE (48Laemmli K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (207497) Google Scholar) and autoradiography. Sequence Analysis of the StBT1—A Stbt1 cDNA clone was isolated from first strand cDNA of potato leaves as described under “Experimental Procedures.” The deduced amino acid sequence was aligned with BT1 homologs from maize (Zea mays), barley (Hordeum vulgare), and A. thaliana (Fig. 1). A comparison of the mature BT1 homologs revealed a high similarity of the StBT1 to the AtBT1, HvNST, and ZmBT1 of 76, 71, and 65%, respectively. For the N-terminal region of StBT1, the ChloroP 1.1 prediction server identified a putative plastidic transit peptide of 22 amino acids as indicated in Fig. 1 (49Emanuelsson O. Nielsen H. Von H.G. Protein Sci. 1999; 8: 978-984Crossref PubMed Scopus (1555) Google Scholar). The amino acid sequence of StBT1 consists of three tandem repeats of ∼100 residues showing six putative transmembrane helices. Three conserved mitochondrial energy transfer signatures were also identified that are characteristic for membrane proteins belonging to the MCF (50Saraste M. Walker J.E. FEBS Lett. 1982; 144: 250-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (242) Google Scholar, 51Millar A.H. Heazlewood J.L. Plant Physiol. 2003; 131: 443-453Crossref PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar). Phylogenetic analyses classify BT1 homologs as members of the MCF forming a monophyletic cluster (39Tjaden J. Haferkamp I. Boxma B. Tielens A.G. Huynen M. Hackstein J.H. Mol. Microbiol. 2004; 51: 1439-1446Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). Subcellular Localization of the StBT1—The ADP-Glc transporter of maize, the ZmBT1, is targeted in vitro to the inner chloroplast envelope membrane (29Liu T-T.Y. Boyer C.D. Shannon J.C. Plant Physiol. 1992; 99: S-39Crossref Scopus (41) Google Scholar). Moreover, immunocytolocalization revealed that ZmBT1 resides in the envelope membrane of amyloplasts in endosperm tissues (52Sullivan T.D. Kaneko Y. Planta. 1995; 196: 477-484Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). However, the prediction of the subcellular membrane integration of the StBT1 homolog is still unclear. Computer programs, such as TargetP (53Emanuelsson O. Nielsen H. Brunak S. Von H.G. J. Mol. Biol. 2000; 300: 1005-1016Crossref PubMed Scopus (3636) Google Scholar), ChloroP, or other search algorithms (49Emanuelsson O. Nielsen H. Von H.G. Protein Sci. 1999; 8: 978-984Crossref PubMed Scopus (1555) Google Scholar) suggest either plastidic or mitochondrial localization of the StBT1. We therefore cloned a reporter gene encoding GFP at the C-terminal site of the StBT1 so that the putative N-terminal transit peptide would remain functional. For determination of the cellular localization in planta, the Stbt1-GFP fusion was transiently expressed in tobacco protoplasts under control of the cauliflower mosaic virus 35S promoter. As controls, we used GFP alone (present in the cytosol and in the nucleus) as well as a voltage-dependent anion channel located in the inner mitochondrial membrane (54Clausen C. Ilkavets I. Thomson R. Philippar K. Vojta A. Möhlmann T. Neuhaus E. Fulgosi H. Soll J. Planta. 2004; 220: 30-37Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). Confocal laser scanning microscopy confirmed a plastidic localization of StBT1. The fluorescent images shown in Fig. 2 (A–C) reveal a co-localization of the transient expressed Stbt1-GFP (green fluorescent spots) with the tobacco chloroplasts (red fluorescence = autofluorescence of plastids), exhibiting a strikingly distinct pattern compared with the controls (Fig. 2, D and E). To determine whether StBT1 is localized in the plastidic envelope membrane, we conducted uptake experiments in which isolated spinach leaf chloroplasts were incubated with the in vitro synthesized radioactively labeled StBT1 precursor protein. As demonstrated in Fig. 3, in vitro translation of StBT1 yielded a protein with an apparent molecular mass of about 41 kDa (Fig. 3, lane 1). In the presence of light, incubation of isolated spinach chloroplasts with the radioactively labeled StBT1 precursor protein led to the incorporation of this protein into the envelope membranes (Fig. 3, lane 3). The additional presence of ATP slightly increased the amount of the StBT1 precursor protein targeted to the envelope membranes (Fig. 3, lane 2). In darkened chloroplasts, no incorporation of the StBT1 precursor protein into the envelope membranes was observed (Fig. 3, lane 5). However, the presence of exogenous ATP resulted in an incorporation of the StBT1 precursor protein showing, thus, that ATP is able to replace light in this system (Fig. 3, lane 4). Comparison of the size of the in vitro synthesized StBT1 precursor protein (Fig. 3, lane 2) with the apparent molecular mass of the protein after incorporation into the envelope membranes (about 39 kDa) indicates that StBT1 is processed to its mature form on import. This is in accordance with the prediction of a short plastidic transit peptide of StBT1 (22 amino acids) identified by ChloroP 1.1 prediction server (49Emanuelsson O. Nielsen H. Von H.G. Protein Sci. 1999; 8: 978-984Crossref PubMed Scopus (1555) Google Scholar). Isolated spinach chloroplasts were routinely treated with thermolysin after incorporation of StBT1 (see “Experimental Procedures”). The resistance against thermolysin (Fig. 3, lanes 2–4) suggests that StBT1 is deeply embedded into the envelope membranes. Lanes 6 and 7 in Fig. 3 show clearly that StBT1 was not targeted to the stroma or the thylakoid fraction. Heterologous Expression of Stbt1 in E. coli Cells—A high degree of sequence similarity among homologs belonging to the same protein family does not necessarily implicate the same function. It is important to identify for each putative homolog the substrates transported as well as their kinetic properties. The overexpression of plant carrier proteins in E. coli and the subsequent reconstitution of the purified proteins into liposomes offer a possibility for successful analysis (55Catoni E. Schwab R.

However, we showed previously that heterologous synthesis of plastidic ATP/ADP transporters in E. coli leads to their functional integration into the bacterial cytoplasmic membrane with transport properties similar to carriers in their authentic membranes (20Tjaden J.

https://openalex.org/W1988431769,"The E5 protein of human papillomavirus type 16 (HPV16) is a small hydrophobic protein, which localizes to the cell membrane, Golgi apparatus and endosomes. HPV16 E5 enhances the activation of the epidermal growth factor (EGFR). The activated EGFR is downregulated through the endocytic pathway, where E5 has been shown to inhibit endosomal acidification and trafficking. Ubiquitination of the activated EGFR plays a role in this downregulation. c-Cbl is a ubiquitin ligase that associates with the activated EGFR and targets it for degradation. Since E5 has been shown to form a complex with the EGFR, we tested the hypothesis that E5 affects the interaction of c-Cbl with the EGFR. We found a significant decrease of c-Cbl bound to the EGFR and of ubiquitinated EGFR in the presence of E5. E5 did not affect c-Cbl steady-state level, phosphorylation or translocation to the membrane. This novel result suggests that HPV16 E5 may, at least in part, upregulate EGFR-mediated signal transduction by inhibiting the interaction of c-Cbl with the EGFR, thereby decreasing c-Cbl-mediated degradation of the EGFR."

Cbl proteins bind to specific tyrosine-phosphorylated sequences in target proteins via the tyrosine kinase-binding (TKB) domain, which comprises a four-helix bundle, an EF-hand calcium-binding domain, and a non-conventional Src homology-2 domain. The previously derived consensus sequence for phosphotyrosine recognition by the Cbl TKB domain is NXpY(S/T)XXP (X denotes lesser residue preference), wherein specificity is conferred primarily by residues C-terminal to the phosphotyrosine. Cbl is recruited to and phosphorylated by the insulin receptor in adipose cells through the adapter protein APS. APS is phosphorylated by the insulin receptor on a C-terminal tyrosine residue, which then serves as a binding site for the Cbl TKB domain. Using x-ray crystallography, site-directed mutagenesis, and calorimetric studies, we have characterized the interaction between the Cbl TKB domain and the Cbl recruitment site in APS, which contains a sequence motif, RA(V/I)XNQpY(S/T), that is conserved in the related adapter proteins SH2-B and Lnk.

The Cbl family of adapter proteins comprises three mammalian members: c-Cbl, Cbl-b, and Cbl-c/Cbl-3. These proteins typically serve as E3 ubiquitin ligases targeting signaling proteins, such as activated protein tyrosine kinases, to the proteasome or lysosome for degradation (1Sanjay A. Horne W.C. Baron R. Sci. STKE 2001. 2001; : PE40Google Scholar). The importance of Cbl (generic for c-Cbl, Cbl-b, and Cbl-c) for down-regulating signaling pathways is underscored by the cell-transforming properties of two Cbl variants, v-Cbl (2Langdon W.Y.

In adipocytes, however, the insulin receptor recruits and phosphorylates Cbl by means of an intermediary adapter protein, APS (adapter with pleckstrin homology and Src homology-2 domains) (21Liu J.

With the exception of a preference for asparagine two residues N-terminal to the phosphotyrosine (P–2), specificity for the Cbl TKB domain is thought to be conferred primarily through residues C-terminal to the phosphotyrosine, in particular, a serine or threonine at the P+1 position and a proline at the P+4 position. The Cbl recruitment sites in signaling proteins that generally match this consensus are given in Fig. 1A.The sequence encompassing Tyr-618 in APS, the Cbl recruitment site near the C terminus, is conserved in SH2-B and Lnk (Fig. 1B). This sequence motif, RA(V/I)XNQpY(S/T), is striking in that the conservation extends back to arginine at the P–6 position. Moreover, the C terminus of APS (and of SH2-B and Lnk) is only three residues from the phosphotyrosine, and therefore this non-canonical Cbl recruitment site ends at the P+3 residue. To understand the molecular basis for Cbl recruitment to APS, and thus to the insulin receptor, we have determined the crystal structure of the c-Cbl TKB domain in complex with a phosphopeptide representing the Cbl recruitment site in APS. The structure shows that conserved residues N-terminal to pTyr-618, which make specific contacts with residues in the four-helix bundle of the TKB domain, play a critical role in recruitment of Cbl to APS. Accompanying site-directed mutagenesis studies of APS and c-Cbl corroborate the structural findings.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESProduction of the c-Cbl TKB Domain—The c-Cbl TKB domain was subcloned from full-length human c-Cbl into the expression vector pGEX-4T-1 (Amersham Biosciences), which includes a thrombin-cleavable N-terminal glutathione S-transferase tag. The construct was transformed into Escherichia coli strain BL21(DE3) for protein expression. The glutathione S-transferase fusion protein was isolated from cleared cell lysates by GSTrap (Amersham Biosciences) affinity chromatography, cleaved by thrombin to remove glutathione S-transferase, and further purified by Source-S (Amersham Biosciences) ion exchange chromatography. The purified protein includes residues 25–351 of human c-Cbl plus two N-terminal residues (GS) remaining from cleavage of the thrombin site. The composition of the purified protein was verified by matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization mass spectrometry. The protein was concentrated to 5 mg/ml in a centrifuge concentrator (Amicon Ultra, Millipore).Phosphopeptides—13-Residue phosphopeptides representing the rat APS pTyr-618 phosphorylation site, GRARAVENQpYSFY, and the human EGF receptor pTyr-1045 phosphorylation site, EDSFLQRpYSSDPT, were synthesized (GeneMed Synthesis), and their masses were verified by matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization-time-of-flight mass spectrometry. The lyophilized peptides were solubilized in 50 mm Hepes, pH 8.0, and 100 mm NaCl.X-ray Crystallography—The purified c-Cbl TKB domain and the APS pTyr-618 phosphopeptide were mixed at a 1:1.6 molar ratio. Crystals of the TKB domain-APS phosphopeptide complex were grown in hanging drops at 22 °C by mixing 2 μl of the TKB domain-phosphopeptide stock solution with 2 μl of reservoir buffer containing 18% polyethylene glycol 8000, 0.2 m magnesium or calcium acetate and 0.1 m sodium cacodylate, pH 6.1. The crystals belong to space group P6 with unit cell dimensions a = b = 122.26 Å, c = 55.13 Å for the magnesium acetate crystals, and a = b = 121.62 Å, c = 54.93 Å for the calcium acetate crystals. There is one TKB-APS complex in the asymmetric unit, giving a solvent content of 61%. Data were collected on beamline X4A at the National Synchrotron Light Source, Brookhaven National Laboratory, and were processed using Denzo/Scalepack software (27Otwinowski Z. Minor W. Methods Enzymol. 1997; 276: 307-326Crossref Scopus (38368) Google Scholar). A molecular replacement solution was found with AMoRe software (28Navaza J. Acta. Crystallogr. Sect.

For the structure determined from crystals grown in magnesium acetate, a Mg2+ ion has been modeled in the Ca2+-binding site of the EF-hand domain, based on the observed distances to oxygen ligands and B-factor considerations.Site-directed Mutagenesis, Mammalian Cell Transfection, Immunoprecipitation and Immunoblotting—Antibodies to Myc (9E10) and hemagglutinin (HA) (F-7) were purchased from Santa Cruz Biotechnology. The Myc-tagged rat APS (pRK5-Myc-APS) construct and the HA-tagged human c-Cbl (pKH3-c-Cbl) construct were kindly provided by Dr. A. Saltiel. Point mutations in APS and c-Cbl were generated using the QuikChange system (Stratagene). All mutations were verified by automated DNA sequencing.Chinese hamster ovary-IR (CHO-IR) cells were maintained in α-minimal essential medium containing 10% fetal bovine serum plus antibiotics. The cells were transfected by Lipofectamine 2000 reagent (Invitrogen). After 6 h, the medium was changed back to the above. After ∼24 h, the cells were serum-deprived for 3 h in Ham's F-12 medium. Sodium orthovanadate (50 μm) was added (or not) to the cell medium 30 min prior to insulin stimulation. Cells in 60-mm-diameter dishes were treated with or without 100 nm insulin and with or without 50 μm sodium orthovanadate for 5 min, washed twice with ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline, and lysed for 30 min at 4 °C with buffer containing 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 135 mm NaCl, 1% Triton X-100, 1.0 mm EDTA, 1.0 mm sodium pyrophosphate, 1.0 mm sodium orthovanadate, 10 mm NaF, and protease inhibitors (Roche Diagnostics). The clarified lysates were incubated with antibodies to Myc for 1 h at 4 °C. The immune complexes were precipitated with protein A/G-agarose (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) for 1 h at 4 °C and were washed extensively with lysis buffer before solubilization in SDS-PAGE sample buffer. Bound proteins were resolved by SDS-PAGE and transferred to Immobilon-P (Millipore) polyvinylidene difluoride membranes. Individual proteins were detected with specific antibodies and visualized by blotting with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibodies (BioSource International).Isothermal Titration Calorimetry—The purified c-Cbl TKB domain was dialyzed overnight in a buffer containing 50 mm Hepes, pH 8.0, and 100 mm NaCl. The APS pTyr-618 phosphopeptide and the EGF receptor pTyr-1045 phosphopeptide were dissolved in the same buffer. Protein concentration was determined by UV light absorption at 280 nm, and peptide concentrations were determined gravimetrically and confirmed by UV light absorption at 280 nm. Calorimetric measurements were conducted at 25 °C with a VP-ITC calorimeter (MicroCal). Each titration experiment consisted of 29 10-μl injections (5 μl for the first injection) of phosphopeptide into the calorimetric cell containing 1.34 ml of the protein solution, with a 5-min interval between each injection. Titration data were processed using ORIGIN software (MicroCal). A small heat of dilution, calculated from the last several injections, was subtracted prior to curve fitting. The thermal constants were derived using a one-site binding model for fitting, varying N (binding stoichiometry), KD (dissociation constant) and ΔH (reaction enthalpy) (31Wiseman T. Williston S. Brandts J.F. Lin L.N. Anal. Biochem. 1989; 179: 131-137Crossref PubMed Scopus (2417) Google Scholar). From these values, the free energy (ΔG) and entropy change (ΔS) upon peptide binding can be calculated using the equation –RTln(1/KD) = ΔG = ΔH – TΔS, where R is the universal molar gas constant, and T is the absolute temperature. The c values (KA·[TKB domain]) for the calorimetry experiments were 253 (APS phosphopeptide) and 32 (EGF receptor phosphopeptide).RESULTSCrystal Structure of the c-Cbl TKB Domain in Complex with the APS pTyr-618 Phosphopeptide—Crystals of the complex between the c-Cbl TKB domain and the APS-derived phosphopeptide (TKB-APS) were obtained in conditions similar to those described for the crystals of the TKB domain complexed with a Zap-70-derived phosphopeptide (TKB-Zap-70) (9Meng W. Sawasdikosol S. Burakoff S.J. Eck M.J. Nature. 1999; 398: 84-90Crossref PubMed Scopus (246) Google Scholar), with either Ca2+ or Mg2+ as the divalent cation. Crystal structures of both the Ca2+ and Mg2+ forms were determined by molecular replacement, using the structure of TKB-Zap-70 (9Meng W. Sawasdikosol S. Burakoff S.J. Eck M.J.

The two structures are virtually identical, and therefore the higher resolution Mg2+ structure was used in the structure analysis that follows.

Sawasdikosol S. Burakoff S.J. Eck M.J. Nature. 1999; 398: 84-90Crossref PubMed Scopus (246) Google Scholar), with a root mean square deviation of C-α positions in the TKB domain (residues 50–350) of only 0.30 Å. As in the TKB-Zap-70 structure, the four-helix bundle, EF-hand domain and SH2 domain make extensive interdomain contacts. The striking difference between the two structures is the differential interactions of the two phosphopeptides with the SH2 domain and four-helix bundle of the TKB domain (Fig. 3B).Fig. 3Crystal structure of the c-Cbl TKB domain in complex with the APS pTyr-618 phosphopeptide.

Residues N-terminal to the phosphotyrosine, beyond P–2, are disordered in the TKB-Zap-70 structure. In contrast, in the TKB-APS structure, the interaction is mediated primarily by the phosphotyrosine and residues N-terminal to the phosphotyrosine, which are well ordered in the structure back to Arg(P–6) (Fig. 2), the beginning of the conserved sequence motif.Several of the APS N-terminal residues make direct contacts with residues of the four-helix bundle (Fig. 3B). Arg(P–6) is salt-bridged to Asp-90 (Fig. 3C), which extends from α-helix B (αB) in the four-helix bundle. The Ala(P–5) side chain lies in a shallow hydrophobic slot formed by residues in the αA-αB linker of the four-helix bundle. Both Arg(P–6) and Ala(P–5) are strictly conserved in the APS adapter family. Val(P–4) points away from the surface of the four-helix bundle and is solvent-exposed. The side chain of Glu(P–3), which is poorly ordered, is also devoid of TKB domain contacts. The Gln(P–1) side chain is well ordered in the structure, but this is because of a hydrogen-bonding interaction with a symmetry-related molecule.The side chain of Asn(P–2) makes several interactions that explain its conservation, not only in the APS pTyr618 motif, but also in the previously recognized consensus sequence for binding of the TKB domain (Fig. 1A). The amide nitrogen of the Asn(P–2) side chain is hydrogen-bonded to the phosphate group of phosphotyrosine and to the carbonyl oxygen of Pro-81 (αA-αB linker) of the four-helix bundle (Fig. 3C). The amide oxygen of the Asn(P–2) side chain makes a water-mediated hydrogen bond with the Asp-275 side chain (αA) of the SH2 domain. These structural observations are consistent with the strong preference for asparagine at the P–2 position, as determined from a degenerate peptide library study (16Lupher Jr., M.L. Songyang Z. Shoelson S.E. Cantley L.C. Band H. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 33140-33144Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (184) Google Scholar). In the TKB-Zap-70 structure, the side chain of Asp(P–2) was poorly ordered but positioned similarly to Asn(P–2) in the TKB-APS structure.In addition to side-chain interactions, residues of the four-helix bundle are hydrogen-bonded to backbone atoms of the phosphopeptide (Fig. 3C). Asn-79 (αA-αB linker) is hydrogen-bonded to the carbonyl oxygen of Arg(P–6), and Asp-86 (αB) is hydrogen-bonded to the backbone nitrogen of Ala(P–5). A backbone-backbone hydrogen bond is observed between Asn-79 and Val(P–4). As in the TKB-Zap-70 structure, Tyr-274 (αA) in the SH2 domain is hydrogen-bonded to the carbonyl oxygen of the P–1 residue.The phosphate group of the phosphotyrosine is bound in the canonical phosphate-binding pocket of the SH2 domain, salt-bridged to SH2-invariant Arg-294 (βB) (Fig. 3C). Residues in the BC loop of the c-Cbl SH2 domain also provide phosphate coordination through backbone and side-chain interactions, very similar to that observed in the crystal structures of the Lck and Src SH2 domains bound to high affinity phosphopeptides (32Eck M.J.

https://openalex.org/W1991323262,"Continuing proliferation requires regulation of cyclin D1 levels in each cell cycle phase. Growth factors stimulate high levels during G2 phase, which commits the cell to continue through G1 phase with sufficient cyclin D1 to initiate DNA synthesis. Upon entry into S phase, however, cyclin D1 levels rapidly decline. Our goal is to understand the mechanism and importance of this S-phase suppression. Here, we demonstrate that cyclin D1 levels decline during S phase due to reduced protein stability, without alterations in the rate of protein synthesis. This decline depends upon Thr 286, since mutation of this site eliminates the normal pattern of cyclin D1 suppression during S phase. As evidence that phosphorylation of Thr 286 is responsible for this decline, Thr 286 is shown to be more efficiently phosphorylated during S phase than in other cell cycle periods. Finally, high cyclin D1 levels during S phase are shown to inhibit DNA synthesis. This inhibitory activity presumably blocks the growth of cells with altered cyclin D1 expression characteristics. Abnormal stimulation of cyclin D1 might result in levels high enough to promote G1/S phase transition even in the absence of appropriate growth stimuli. In such cells, however, the levels of cyclin D1 would presumably be too high to be suppressed during S phase, resulting in the inhibition of DNA synthesis."

In this study, we show that BBK32 shares sequence similarity with fibronectin module-binding motifs previously identified in proteins from Streptococcus pyogenes and Staphylococcus aureus. Nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy and isothermal titration calorimetry are used to confirm the binding sites of BBK32 peptides within the N-terminal domain of fibronectin and to measure the affinities of the interactions. Comparison of chemical shift perturbations in fibronectin F1 modules on binding of peptides from BBK32, FnBPA from S. aureus, and SfbI from S. pyogenes provides further evidence for a shared mechanism of binding. Despite the different locations of the bacterial attachment sites in BBK32 compared with SfbI from S. pyogenes and FnBPA from S. aureus, an antiparallel orientation is observed for binding of the N-terminal domain of fibronectin to each of the pathogens.

Fn is a human extracellular glycoprotein involved in important physiological processes such as cell migration and wound healing. Fn is targeted by the pathogenic bacteria Staphylococcus aureus and Streptococcus pyogenes through bacterial cell wall-attached Fn-binding proteins (FnBPs) (4Schwarz-Linek U. Hook M. Potts J.R. Mol. Microbiol. 2004; 52: 631-641Crossref PubMed Scopus (218) Google Scholar). These FnBPs belong to a class of adhesins called “microbial surface components recognizing adhesive matrix molecules” (4Schwarz-Linek U. Hook M. Potts J.R. Mol.

The first high resolution structural data for these interactions (10Schwarz-Linek U. Werner J.M. Pickford A.R. Gurusiddappa S. Kim J.H. Pilka E.S. Briggs J.A.G. Gough T.S. Höök M. Campbell I.D. Potts J.R. Nature. 2003; 423: 177-181Crossref PubMed Scopus (306) Google Scholar) revealed a novel mechanism of protein-protein interaction and led us to propose a new model for binding of S. pyogenes and S. aureus to the N-terminal domain (NTD) of Fn (10Schwarz-Linek U. Werner J.M. Pickford A.R. Gurusiddappa S. Kim J.H. Pilka E.S. Briggs J.A.G. Gough T.S. Höök M. Campbell I.D. Potts J.R. Nature. 2003; 423: 177-181Crossref PubMed Scopus (306) Google Scholar). The NTD of Fn contains five F1 modules (1–5F1), each with a consensus fold containing a double-stranded antiparallel β-sheet and a triple-stranded antiparallel β-sheet. In this model, structurally disordered Fn-binding repeats (FnBRs) within the bacterial FnBPs bind 1–5F1 or 2–5F1 in the NTD of Fn, primarily by forming an additional β-strand on the triple stranded β-sheet of each F1 module. We have shown previously that these Fn-BRs contain strings of F1 binding motifs in the correct order to bind the consecutive F1 modules in the NTD (11Schwarz-Linek U. Pilka E.S. Pickford A.R.

FnBPs from both S. pyogenes and S. aureus contain multiple FnBRs (10Schwarz-Linek U. Werner J.M. Pickford A.R. Gurusiddappa S. Kim J.H. Pilka E.S. Briggs J.A.G. Gough T.S. Höök M. Campbell I.D.

Barthold S.W. Telford S.R. Flavell R.A. J. Immunol. 2000; 164: 5344-5351Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). In humans, BBK32 antibodies are observed in infected persons (14Heikkila T. Huppertz H.L. Seppala I. Sillanpaa H. Saxen H. Lahdenne P. J. Infect. Dis. 2003; 187: 1888-1894Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar), suggesting that the protein is present during human infection. Antibodies to BBK32 can partially protect mice from tick-borne infection (13Fikrig E. Feng W. Barthold S.W. Telford S.R. Flavell R.A. J. Immunol. 2000; 164: 5344-5351Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). BBK32 consists of a C-terminal globular domain and an N-terminal region lacking well-defined secondary structure (15Kim J.H. Singvall J. Schwarz-Linek U. Johnson B.J.B. Potts J.R. Hook M. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 41706-41714Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). In prior studies, the Fn-binding activity of BBK32 was localized to a 32-residue peptide within the unstructured domain that shares sequence homology (in the N terminus of the peptide) to the upstream Fn-binding region of an FnBP (SfbI) from S. pyogenes (16Probert W.S. Kim J.H. Höök M. Johnson B.J.B. Infect. Immun. 2001; 69: 4129-4133Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). This region of SfbI had been shown to bind to the gelatin-binding domain (GBD) of Fn (17Talay S.R. Zock A. Rohde M. Molinari G. Oggioni M. Pozzi G. Guzman C.A. Chhatwal G.S. Cell. Microbiol. 2000; 2: 521-535Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar) (Fig. 1). More recently, it has been shown that, like the FnBPs from S. aureus and S. pyogenes, the disordered region of BBK32 undergoes a significant conformational change on binding to the NTD of Fn with an increase in β-sheet content in the complex (15Kim J.H. Singvall J. Schwarz-Linek U. Johnson B.J.B. Potts J.R. Hook M. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 41706-41714Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). This suggests that BBK32 could interact with the NTD of Fn in a manner similar to that of the FnBPs of S. aureus and S. pyogenes. In this study, we show that BBK32 has sequence similarity to F1 binding motifs within S. aureus and S. pyogenes FnBPs. Although the similarity is limited, we successfully locate a string of F1 binding motifs in the correct order to bind sequential F1 modules in the NTD of Fn. Comparison of NMR chemical shift perturbations of residues in F1 modules on binding of peptides from BBK32, FnBPA, and SfbI provide further evidence for a common mechanism of Fn binding between these pathogens. Recombinant Proteins and Synthetic Peptides—Uniformly (U) 15N-labeled module pairs 2F13F1 and 4F15F1 (residues 62–151 and 152–244 of mature human Fn, respectively) were expressed in Pichia pastoris and purified using procedures similar to those described previously (10Schwarz-Linek U. Werner J.M. Pickford A.R. Gurusiddappa S. Kim J.H. Pilka E.S. Briggs J.A.G. Gough T.S. Höök M. Campbell I.D. Potts J.R.

The N and C termini of these synthetic peptides were capped by acetylation and amidation at the N and C termini, respectively. NMR Spectroscopy—All NMR experiments were performed on spectrometers belonging to the Oxford Centre for Molecular Sciences with 1H operating frequencies of 500 and 600 MHz. The spectrometers are all equipped with Oxford Instruments superconducting magnets, OMEGA software, digital control equipment (Bruker Instruments), triple-resonance pulsed-field gradient probe-heads (built in-house; Ref. 19Soffe N. Boyd J. Leonard M. J. Magn. Reson. Ser. A. 1995; 116: 117-121Crossref Scopus (26) Google Scholar), and linear amplifiers (built in-house) for 1H, 15N, and 13C nuclei. Spectra were recorded at 25 °C, processed using the program Felix (Accelrys, San Diego, CA), and analyzed using NMRView5.0 (20Johnson B.A. Blevins R.A. J. Biomol. NMR. 1994; 4: 603-614Crossref PubMed Scopus (2686) Google Scholar). 1H-15N Heteronuclear single quantum correlation (HSQC) spectra were acquired of samples of U-15N2F13F1 or U-15N4F15F1 with increasing concentrations of peptide. Because of the pH dependence of the solubility of the peptides and Fn module pairs, experiments using BBKTT, BBKTTb, and BBKTw were performed at pH 7, experiments using BBKFF and BBKFo were performed at pH 6, and experiments with AuTw1 and AuFo3 were performed at pH 5. For experiments with BBKTT, BBKTw, BBKFF, BBKFo, AuTw1, and AuFo3, the F1 module pair concentration was ∼0.2 mm, and for the BBKTTb experiment, the 2F13F1 concentration was 0.06 mm. Module pair concentrations were determined by measuring the absorbance at 280 nm. Peptide concentrations were determined using either absorbance at 280 nm or the mass. In the NMR titration experiments, peptide concentration was increased until binding was saturated or the solubility limit of the peptide was reached. 15N-1H chemical shift assignments for U-15N2F13F1 or U-15N4F15F1 at appropriate pH values were obtained using previously determined assignments (11Schwarz-Linek U.

For assignment of the HSQC of U-15N4F15F1 when bound to BBKFF, three-dimensional nuclear Overhauser effect spectroscopy-HSQC and total correlation spectroscopy-HSQC spectra of U-15N4F15F1 (0.5 mm)/BBKFF (2.1 mm) were used. For all peptides, Fn residues affected by peptide binding were identified based on observed chemical shift changes of F1 module backbone amide resonances (chemical shift perturbation mapping). Dissociation constants (Kd) for the interactions were calculated as described previously (10Schwarz-Linek U. Werner J.M. Pickford A.R. Gurusiddappa S. Kim J.H. Pilka E.S. Briggs J.A.G. Gough T.S. Höök M. Campbell I.D. Potts J.R. Nature. 2003; 423: 177-181Crossref PubMed Scopus (306) Google Scholar) using at least eight titrating chemical shifts in each spectrum. Isothermal Titration Calorimetry—The Kd for binding of BBKTTb to 2F13F1 was measured at 25 °C in 10 mm sodium/potassium phosphate buffer, pH 7.4, with a VP-ITC microcalorimeter (MicroCal LLC, Northampton, MA). BBKTTb and 2F13F1 concentrations were determined by measuring the absorbance at 280 nm. Both the cell (containing the 2F13F1 module pair, 0.22 mm) and syringe solutions (containing BBKTTb, 3.07 mm) were degassed at 15 °C for 20 min. One preliminary injection was 2 μl, and 37 injections were of 6 μl with a stirring speed of 310 rpm and a 3-min delay between injections. To take into account heat of dilution, a blank titration was performed by injecting peptide solution into buffer, and the linear prediction of this heat of dilution was subtracted from the main experiment. Data were analyzed using Origin software (OriginLab Corp.), fitting them to a single binding site model. Prediction of F1-Binding Peptides from BBK32 using S. pyogenes and S. aureus FnBP sequences—Fig. 1 shows a sequence alignment of residues 126–190 of BBK32 with FnBRs from S. pyogenes and S. aureus (10Schwarz-Linek U. Werner J.M. Pickford A.R. Gurusiddappa S. Kim J.H. Pilka E.S. Briggs J.A.G. Gough T.S. Höök M. Campbell I.D. Potts J.R. Nature. 2003; 423: 177-181Crossref PubMed Scopus (306) Google Scholar). Sequence homology between the upstream Fn-binding region (GBD-binding) region of SfbI, an FnBP from S. pyogenes, and BBK32 was reported previously (16Probert W.S. Kim J.H. Höök M. Johnson B.J.B. Infect. Immun. 2001; 69: 4129-4133Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). We showed recently that directly C-terminal of the upstream Fn-binding region region in SfbI is an NTD-binding region containing five FnBRs. Within these FnBRs, we identified motifs that bind to specific F1 module pairs. In this study, we used the limited similarity between these F1 binding motifs and the BBK32 sequence to successfully identify F1 binding motifs of BBK32 in the correct order to bind to sequential F1 modules in the NTD of Fn. Thus, we used Fig. 1 to predict 2F13F1-(BBKTT, BBKTTb), 2F1-(BBKTw), 4F15F1-(BBKFF), and 4F1-(BBKFo) binding peptides from BBK32. Binding of BBK32 Peptides to 4F15F1—Chemical shift perturbations observed for the backbone amide 1H and 15N nuclei for residues in 4F15F1 on addition of BBKFF and BBKFo are shown in Fig. 2. On addition of BBKFF to 4F15F1, significant chemical shift changes are observed in residues from both 4F1 and 5F1. This suggests that both modules are involved in the interaction with BBKFF. On addition of BBKFo (in which the predicted 5F1 binding motif had been removed; Fig. 1), the most significant chemical shift changes are observed for residues in 4F1, with changes in 5F1 restricted to residues near the previously identified interface between the two F1 modules (22Williams M.J. Phan I. Harvey T.S. Rostagno A. Gold L.I. Campbell I.D. J. Mol. Biol. 1994; 235: 1302-1311Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). Residues 231 and 232 in the D–E loop and residues 236 and 238 in the E strand of 5F1 undergo 15N chemical shift perturbations of >1 ppm on addition of BBKFF but have only small perturbations on addition of BBKFo to 4F15F1. In 4F1, residues 188 and 190 in the D–E loop, residues 191–195 in the E strand, and a single residue (Val-180) in strand D undergo the largest chemical shift perturbations on addition of BBKFo. The Kd values for binding of BBKFF and BBKFo to 4F15F1 were determined to be 20 ± 6 and 590 ± 50 μm, respectively. The higher affinity binding of BBKFF is consistent with the binding of this peptide to both 4F1 and 5F1, whereas BBKFo binds only 4F1. Thus, Fig. 2 demonstrates that BBKFF and BBKFo bind to their predicted targets in the N-terminal domain of Fn. In addition, the chemical shift perturbation data support an antiparallel orientation of binding of BBK32 to 4F15F1 and the importance of the D–E loop and E strand residues in peptide binding. Binding of BBK32 Peptides to 2F13F1—The sequence alignment in Fig. 1 was used to identify 2F1 and 3F1 binding motifs in BBK32. A comparison of chemical shift perturbations of 2F13F1 resonances on addition of BBKTT (Fig. 3A) and BBKTw (Fig. 3B) clearly shows that both modules in 2F13F1 were involved in binding to BBKTT, whereas BBKTw binds 2F1. On addition of BBKTw, which lacks the N-terminal (predicted 3F1 binding) residues, chemical shift changes were observed primarily for residues in 2F1. In particular, residues 144 in the D–E loop and residues 145 and 146 in the E strand of 3F1, which show the largest 1H chemical shift changes (of 3F1 residues) on addition of BBKTT, undergo only very small changes on binding of BBKTw. Significant changes in the chemical shift of some 3F1 residues are observed on addition of the shorter peptide. These residues (for example, Ser-117 in strand B) are in strands A and B and in the D–E loop, which would be predicted, on the basis of the structure of the homologous 4F15F1 module pair (22Williams M.J. Phan I. Harvey T.S. Rostagno A. Gold L.I. Campbell I.D. J. Mol. Biol. 1994; 235: 1302-1311Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar), to form part of an interface between the 2F1 and 3F1 modules. The chemical shift perturbation data support an antiparallel orientation of binding of BBK32 to 2F13F1, with the N-terminal part of the peptide binding to the C-terminal module in the pair. In BBKTw, the C terminus was extended, but this clearly has very little effect on the chemical shift changes in 2F1. This suggested that the C terminus of BBKTT correctly marked the boundary of the 2F1 binding motif. The Kd values for the interactions were then compared (Fig. 3, D and E). BBKTT bound with a Kd of 230 ± 60 μm, whereas BBKTw bound with a Kd of 38 ± 6 μm. This was not consistent with our previous comparisons of F1 binding motifs, where the module-pair binding peptides bind with higher affinity than the single module binding peptides. Thus, the binding of an additional peptide, BBKTTb, which had a shorter N terminus but longer C terminus, was tested. In a comparison of Fig. 3, A and C, it is clear that the main changes in chemical shift perturbation occur in the E strand of 3F1, suggesting that part of the 3F1 binding motif has been removed by truncating the N terminus of the peptide. The Kd for binding of BBKTTb to 2F13F1 was 30 μm. This difference of nearly 10-fold between Kd values for the interaction of the two (BBKTT and BBKTTb) 2F13F1 binding peptides with 2F13F1 suggests that despite the subtle differences in backbone chemical shift perturbations, a residue near the C terminus of BBKTTb (which was not included in BBKTT) interacts with the side chain of a 2F1 residue. This interaction seems to make a significant contribution to the affinity of the interaction, and high resolution structural studies are in progress to reveal further details of these interactions. Comparison of Chemical Shift Perturbation in 2F1 and 4F1 on Binding of Fn-binding Peptides from B. burgdorferi, S. pyogenes, and S. aureus—The successful identification above of Fn-binding BBK32 peptides based on a sequence alignment of BBK32 with FnBPs from S. pyogenes and S. aureus provides strong evidence for a common mechanism of Fn-binding for these three pathogens. However, further evidence can be obtained by comparing the pattern of chemical shift changes in F1 modules observed on binding of the bacterial peptides. In Fig. 4, the pattern of backbone amide 15N and 1H chemical shift perturbations for residues in 2F1 (A–C) and 4F1 (D–F) on binding of BBKTw and BBKFo, respectively, is compared with the changes observed on binding of 2F1- and 4F1-binding motifs from S. pyogenes and S. aureus. From the concentration of large perturbations in the C-terminal region of both the modules, this figure clearly shows the involvement of residues in the D–E loop and E strand of the F1 module in binding to all six peptides. In addition, given the differences in the sequences of the peptides, there are striking similarities in the patterns of these perturbations (highlighted in Fig. 4). Residues in the A-strand also underwent significant chemical shift changes on binding of the six peptides; the pattern of changes was strikingly similar for binding of the 4F1 binding peptides. Based on the first high resolution structural data for Fn/bacterial FnBP interactions (10Schwarz-Linek U. Werner J.M. Pickford A.R. Gurusiddappa S. Kim J.H. Pilka E.S. Briggs J.A.G. Gough T.S. Höök M. Campbell I.D. Potts J.R. Nature. 2003; 423: 177-181Crossref PubMed Scopus (306) Google Scholar), we recently proposed a model for S. aureus and S. pyogenes binding to Fn in which structurally disordered Fn-binding repeats in the C-terminal region of FnBPs bind to the NTD of Fn primarily by formation of short antiparallel β-strands on the triple-stranded β-sheet of sequential F1 modules of the NTD (4Schwarz-Linek U.

In this tandem β-zipper mechanism of FnBR/Fn binding, we showed that each F1 module is recognized by short motifs within the bacterial FnBRs, resulting in the formation of a high affinity binding site for Fn (11Schwarz-Linek U. Pilka E.S. Pickford A.R. Kim J.H. Hook M. Campbell I.D. Potts J.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 39017-39025Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). The unstructured N-terminal region of BBK32 from the Lyme disease pathogen B. burgdorferi has been shown to undergo a significant conformational change with an apparent increase in β-sheet content (15Kim J.H.

This was reminiscent of the results of similar experiments performed using a streptococcal FnBP (23House-Pompeo K. Xu Y. Joh D. Speziale P. Höök M. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 1379-1384Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar) and consistent with BBK32 binding to Fn using the tandem β-zipper mechanism. In addition, BBK32 had been shown to share sequence homology with the GBD-binding region of SfbI from S. pyogenes (16Probert W.S. Kim J.H. Höök M. Johnson B.J.B. Infect. Immun. 2001; 69: 4129-4133Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). In SfbI from S. pyogenes, binding sites for the NTD of Fn lie C-terminal to the GBD binding site. With the hypothesis that this may also be true for BBK32, we used sequence alignments of BBK32 with NTD-binding regions from FnBPs of S. pyogenes and S. aureus (Fig. 1) and identified potential binding sites within BBK32 (BBKTT and BBKFF; Fig. 1) for module pairs from the NTD of Fn. Comparison of chemical shift perturbations on binding of BBK32 peptides to F1 module pairs shows the involvement of 2F1, 3F1, 4F1, and 5F1 in the binding to BBK32. As observed previously for SfbI from S. pyogenes, the orientation of binding of BBK32 to Fn is antiparallel; that is, the C terminus of BBKTT (BBKTw) binds 2F1, and the C terminus of BBKFF (BBKFo) binds 4F1. Thus, we have identified a sequence of F1 binding motifs in BBK32 in the correct order to bind sequential F1 modules (2-5F1) in the NTD of Fn. The antiparallel orientation of binding is consistent with the putative GBD-binding sequence lying N-terminal to the NTD-binding sequence (Fig. 5). As in the FnBRs FnBPA-1–11 and SfbI-1–4 from S. aureus and S. pyogenes, respectively (10Schwarz-Linek U. Werner J.M. Pickford A.R. Gurusiddappa S. Kim J.H. Pilka E.S. Briggs J.A.G. Gough T.S. Höök M. Campbell I.D. Potts J.R. Nature. 2003; 423: 177-181Crossref PubMed Scopus (306) Google Scholar), a 1F1 binding motif has not yet been identified in BBK32. The chemical shift perturbation data provide important clues to the mechanism of binding. When chemical shift perturbations in 2F1 and 4F1 on binding of BBK32 are compared with those observed on binding of S. aureus and S. pyogenes Fn-binding peptides (Fig. 4), it is clear that all three pathogens bind to the same surface of the F1 modules. The similarity between the magnitude and direction of the largest shifts is striking given the differences between the bacterial peptide sequences. Furthermore, the evidence for the involvement in the binding of the E strand residues in each of the F1 modules, together with the previous evidence for an increase in β-strand content in BBK32 on binding to Fn (15Kim J.H. Singvall J. Schwarz-Linek U. Johnson B.J.B. Potts J.R. Hook M. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 41706-41714Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar), provide very strong evidence that BBK32 uses the tandem β-zipper mechanism previously identified for streptococcal binding to Fn (10Schwarz-Linek U. Werner J.M. Pickford A.R. Gurusiddappa S. Kim J.H. Pilka E.S. Briggs J.A.G. Gough T.S. Höök M. Campbell I.D. Potts J.R. Nature. 2003; 423: 177-181Crossref PubMed Scopus (306) Google Scholar). Although we have shown that BBK32 contains 2F1, 3F1, 4F1, and 5F1 binding motifs and have identified the approximate N and C termini of the 2-5F1 binding sequence, the sequence similarity of BBK32 with FnBPs from Gram-positive bacteria is insufficient for identification of the specific bacterial residues involved in F1 module binding. The length of BBKFF (18 residues) is consistent with the length of previously identified 4F15F1 binding peptides (PyFF5; 19 residues) (11Schwarz-Linek U. Pilka E.S. Pickford A.R. Kim J.H. Hook M. Campbell I.D. Potts J.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 39017-39025Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). The optimal 2F13F1 binding peptide, however, seems to be at least 24 residues long. This is significantly longer than previously identified 2F13F1 binding peptides from S. pyogenes (PyTT5, 18 residues; PyTT4, 19 residues) (11Schwarz-Linek U. Pilka E.S. Pickford A.R. Kim J.H. Hook M. Campbell I.D. Potts J.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 39017-39025Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar) and may justify a different alignment of the sequences in Fig. 1, where, for example, gaps are included between the 2F1- and 3F1 binding motifs. Other alignments of the FnBPs (other than that shown in Fig. 1A) with higher similarity in regions of the 2F1-binding and 4F1-binding motifs of the Gram-positive FnBPs are possible if significant gaps are introduced into these Gram-positive FnBP sequences (Fig. 1B). In addition, sequence similarity cannot be used to identify the ‘register’ of the antiparallel β-zipper interaction with the NTD of Fn (i.e. to identify which BBK32 and Fn residues are opposed in the β-sheet). Having established this unexpected similarity between the NTD-binding mechanisms of B. burgdorferi and Gram-positive bacteria, we aim to obtain high resolution structural data for BBK32/NTD complexes to answer these questions. As in S. pyogenes binding to Fn, binding of BBK32 to the NTD occured in an antiparallel orientation. This is perhaps a little surprising, in that the BBK32 membrane attachment site is near the N terminus, whereas FnBPs of S. pyogenes and S. aureus are attached to the bacterial cell wall near the C terminus of the protein. The conservation of the antiparallel orientation of Fn despite the difference in location of the bacterial attachment site suggests that if the role played by the S. pyogenes and B. burgdorferi FnBPs is similar, it is independent of the orientation of Fn with respect to the bacterial cell-surface. That is, in SfbI, 1F1 binds closest (in sequence) to the cell-wall attachment site, whereas in BBK32, the GBD binding site and then 5F1 would lie closest to the bacterial surface (Fig. 5). This would be consistent with previous suggestions (4Schwarz-Linek U. Hook M. Potts J.R. Mol. Microbiol. 2004; 52: 631-641Crossref PubMed Scopus (218) Google Scholar) that bacterial proteins play a role in activating Fn, so that the RGD sequence, in the central region of Fn, is accessible for integrin binding (4Schwarz-Linek U. Hook M. Potts J.R. Mol. Microbiol. 2004; 52: 631-641Crossref PubMed Scopus (218) Google Scholar). FnBP-mediated uptake of S. aureus and S. pyogenes may allow these bacteria to evade the host immune system or administered antibiotics, aiding the persistence of the bacteria within the host. We and others have suggested that multiple Fn-binding sites may play a role in integrin-clustering and subsequent uptake of S. pyogenes and S. aureus into epithelial cells (4Schwarz-Linek U. Hook M. Potts J.R. Mol. Microbiol. 2004; 52: 631-641Crossref PubMed Scopus (218) Google Scholar). Unlike SfbI from S. pyogenes and FnBPA from S. aureus, which both contain multiple Fn binding sites (11Schwarz-Linek U. Pilka E.S. Pickford A.R. Kim J.H. Hook M. Campbell I.D. Potts J.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 39017-39025Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar, 24Ingham K.C. Brew S. Vaz D. Sauder D.N. McGavin M.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 42945-42953Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar), so far only one Fn-binding site has been identified in BBK32. However, integrin clustering might also be achieved through binding of Fn to multiple copies of the FnBP. Whether BBK32 mediates uptake of B. burgdorferi into epithelial or endothelial cells in vivo has yet to be established, although in vitro invasion of endothelial cells by B. burgdorferi has been reported (25Ma Y. Sturrock A. Weis J.J. Infect. Immun. 1991; 59: 671-678Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). It has also been shown in vitro that B. burgdorferi is able to attach to the apical surface of endothelial cells, migrate through the intercellular spaces and into the subendothelial matrix. Thus, cellular invasion, which has been suggested to play a role in hematogenous dissemination of S. aureus and S. pyogenes, may not be necessary for B. burgdorferi migration. The spirochete B. burgdorferi is morphologically distinct from the Gram-positive pathogens S. aureus and S. pyogenes. For example, spirochetes are motile, tightly coiled, bacteria 8–30 μm in length, whereas S. aureus and S. pyogenes are non-motile spherical bacteria with a diameter of 0.5–1 μm (26Madigan M. Martinko J.M. Parker J. Brock Biology of Microrganisms. 9th Ed. Prentice Hall, Upper Saddle River, NJ2000Google Scholar). In addition, Gram-positive cocci and spirochetes are contained in different major lineages (kingdoms) of bacteria. Although the precise role(s) of Fn binding in infection have yet to be demonstrated for bacterial pathogens, the identification of a conserved mechanism of Fn binding between streptococci, staphylococci, and spirochetes hints at the importance of this mechanism for the bacteria and suggests that it may be more widespread in bacterial/Fn interactions than has been demonstrated so far."

Steroid treatment transforms MR from a transcriptionally inert state, in which it is distributed equally between the nucleus and cytoplasm, to an active completely nuclear transcription factor. We report here that MR is an atypical nuclear hormone receptor that moves unidirectionally from the cytoplasm to the nucleus. We show that nuclear import of MR is controlled through three nuclear localization signals (NLSs) of distinct types. Nuclear localization of naïve MR was mediated primarily through a novel serine/threonine-rich NLS (NL0) in the receptor N terminus. Specific amino acid substitutions that mimicked phosphorylation selectively enhanced or repressed NL0 activity, highlighting the potential for active regulation of this new type of NLS. The second NLS (NL2) within the ligand-binding domain also lacks a recognizable basic motif. Nuclear transfer through this signal was strictly dependent on steroid agonist, but was independent of the interaction of MR with coactivator proteins. The third MR NLS (NL1) is a bipartite basic motif localized to the C terminus of the MR DNA-binding domain with properties distinct from those of NL1 of the closely related glucocorticoid receptor. NL1 acted in concert with NL0 and NL2 to stimulate nuclear uptake of the agonist-treated receptor, but also directed the complete nuclear localization of MR in response to treatment with steroid antagonist.

Indeed, MR has a higher affinity for glucocorticoids than for mineralocorticoids and is more sensitive to glucocorticoids than the glucocorticoid receptor (GR) (1Arriza J.L. Simerly R.B. Swanson L.W. Evans R.M. Neuron. 1988; 1: 887-900Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (512) Google Scholar, 2Reul J.M. de Kloet E.R. Endocrinology. 1985; 117: 2505-2511Crossref PubMed Scopus (2220) Google Scholar). In epithelial tissues such as the tubules of kidney and distal colon, specificity of MR signaling in response to mineralocorticoids is maintained by the expression of 11β-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase-2, which converts cortisol or corticosterone to inactive keto metabolites (3White P.C. Mune T. Agarwal A.K. Endocr. Rev. 1997; 18: 135-156Crossref PubMed Scopus (544) Google Scholar). In tissues in which 11β-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase-2 is not expressed, such as within the brain and vascular system, basal glucocorticoid levels are sufficient to transmit transcriptional responses through MR. By contrast, signaling through GR reflects the diurnal variation of glucocorticoid levels and acute responses to stimulation of the hypothalamic-pituitary axis. Where the potential for signaling through both MR and GR exists, the activation of each receptor communicates distinct physiological outcomes (4Sousa N. Almeida O.F. Rev. Neurosci. 2002; 13: 59-84Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar, 5Roozendaal B. Neurobiol. Learn. Mem. 2002; 78: 578-595Crossref PubMed Scopus (655) Google Scholar). Glucocorticoid signaling in these tissues involves both overlapping targeting of MR and GR in the nucleus and heteromeric interactions between the two receptors (6Pearce D. Yamamoto K.R.

Prior to exposure to steroid, MR and other steroid receptors are associated with a chaperone protein complex anchored by HSP90. Upon binding to steroid, MR dissociates from its chaperone complex and undergoes a conformational change to an active state that allows for the regulation of specific gene expression in collaboration with a variety of transcriptional co-regulatory factors (11Pratt W.B. Toft D.O. Endocr. Rev. 1997; 18: 306-360Crossref PubMed Scopus (1537) Google Scholar, 12Cheung J. Smith D.F. Mol. Endocrinol. 2000; 14: 939-946Crossref PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar). Although similar in their overall mechanisms of action, steroid hormone receptors exhibit differences in their subcellular localization and the regulation of subcellular localization that are hypothesized to be important for the regulation of steroid responsiveness. Thus, the receptor and progesterone receptors are constitutively nuclear in their naïve state (13Htun H. Holth L.T. Walker D. Davie J.R. Hager G.L. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1999; 10: 471-486Crossref PubMed Scopus (219) Google Scholar), whereas the androgen receptor has been widely reported to localize to the cytoplasm prior to ligand binding (14Georget V.

By contrast, naïve MR is distributed evenly in the nucleus and cytoplasm in most cell types studied (24Fejes-Toth G. Pearce D. Naray-Fejes-Toth A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 2973-2978Crossref PubMed Scopus (214) Google Scholar, 25Lombes M. Farman N. Oblin M.E. Baulieu E.E. Bonvalet J.P. Erlanger B.F. Gasc J.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

The regulation of their distribution between the nucleus and cytoplasm offers an essential control point for the regulation of the activity and stability of many transcription factors. For example, STAT1 (signal transducer and activator of transcription-1) accumulates in the nucleus in response to interferon and rapidly returns to the cytoplasm upon removal of the stimulus (28Begitt A. Meyer T. van Rossum M. Vinkemeier U. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 10418-10423Crossref PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar). Similarly, p53 function is also tightly regulated through nuclear export and sequestration in the cytoplasm (29Lohrum M.A. Woods D.B. Ludwig R.L. Balint E. Vousden K.H. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 21: 8521-8532Crossref PubMed Scopus (195) Google Scholar, 30Nikolaev A.Y. Li M. Puskas N. Qin J. Gu W.

Biol. 2001; 21: 8533-8546Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). Smad proteins accumulate in the nucleus in response to transforming growth factor-β signaling, and the regulation of activated Smad proteins is dependent on communication with cytosolic components of the transforming growth factor-β signaling pathway via continuous nucleocytoplasmic shuttling (32Xu L. Kang Y. Col S. Massague J. Mol. Cell. 2002; 10: 271-282Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (202) Google Scholar, 33Inman G.J. Nicolas F.J. Hill C.S. Mol. Cell. 2002; 10: 283-294Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (326) Google Scholar). Although the signals that determine MR nuclear import have not been characterized, import of GR in response to steroid occurs through two signals termed NL1 and NL2 (18Picard D. Yamamoto K.R. EMBO J. 1987; 6: 3333-3340Crossref PubMed Scopus (724) Google Scholar). NL1 is composed of a cluster of basic amino acids in the C-terminal region of the GR DNA-binding domain (DBD) (22Savory J.G. Hsu B. Laquian I.R. Giffin W. Reich T. Haché R.J. Lefebvre Y.A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 1025-1037Crossref PubMed Scopus (182) Google Scholar). The NL2 sequence resides within the GR ligand-binding domain (LBD), but has not been mapped to a specific amino acid segment (18Picard D. Yamamoto K.R. EMBO J. 1987; 6: 3333-3340Crossref PubMed Scopus (724) Google Scholar). GR and other nuclear hormone receptors have been observed to move continuously between the nucleus and cytoplasm in both their active and naïve states (34Guiochon-Mantel A. Loosfelt H. Lescop P.

Although regulatory consequences of shuttling have been hypothesized, specific effects largely remain to be discovered. In this study, we performed a detailed examination of the movement of MR between the cytoplasm and nucleus. By contrast to other nuclear receptors, we report that the transfer of MR to the nucleus is essentially unidirectional. Furthermore, the localization of MR to the nucleus in the absence and presence of hormone was dependent upon the complex interplay of three nuclear localization signals (NLSs) of different composition located in the N terminus, DBD, and LBD of the receptor, respectively. The N-terminal MR NLS, which was found to be primarily responsible for the nuclear localization of the naïve receptor, is a novel type consisting of a serine/threonine-rich motif that we show has the potential to be regulated by specific phosphorylation. Plasmids—Plasmids pTLGR, pTLGRNL1–, and pTLBuMR encoding full-length wild-type rat GR, full-length rat GR with the 513NNN515 NL1 mutation, and full-length rat MR with a N-terminal BuGR epitope tag, respectively, have been described previously (22Savory J.G.

Walther R.F. Lefebvre Y.A. Haché R.J. Mol. Cell.

The MR LBD sequence encompassing residues 698–981 was PCR-amplified and subcloned into pTL2 to generate pTLMR690C. pTLGGM encodes the GR N terminus and DNA-binding domain (including the GR NL1 sequence) encompassing residues 22–526 cloned in-frame with the MR LBD sequence. pTLGGMNL1– is a derivative of pTLGGM that contains the GR NL1 mutation. pTLGMM encodes the GR N terminus from residues 22 to 437 cloned in-frame with the MR DBD and LBD encompassing residues 600–981. pTLMGG encodes the MR N terminus from residues 1 to 602 cloned in-frame with the GR DBD and LBD encompassing residues 440–795. pTLMRΔ590–602 was cloned by amplification of the entire pTLMR sequence with primers flanking the sequence encoding residues 590–602, followed by ligation of the PCR product. pGFPMR1–602 was derived by cloning the MR N terminus (amino acids 1–602) into pEGFP-C1 (Clontech). pGFPMR encodes full-length rat MR as an N-terminal fusion with green fluorescent protein (GFP). PCR amplification products encompassing MR residues 1–550 and 150–602 were cloned into pEGFP-C1 to generate pGFPMR1–550 and pGFPMR150–602. To mutate the putative Borna disease virus-like NLS at residues 561–570 and 601 (S601D) in the context of GFP-MR, the QuikChange mutagenesis kit was used. The glutathione S-transferase (GST) coding sequence was PCR-amplified and then subcloned into pEGFP-C1. The derivative plasmids of pGSTGFP that express MR or GR peptides C-terminal to the GST-GFP moiety (as indicated in the figure legends) were generated by PCR amplification of the appropriate sequence. In the case of plasmids pGSTGFPNL0592/4/5A, pGSTGFPNL0592/4/5D, pGSTGFPNL0597/8/601A, pGSTGFPNL0597/8/601D, and the derivatives constructed with individual amino acid substitutions at the same positions, the appropriate mutations were introduced using PCR primers. The MR DBD, MR DBDWN, MR DBDNW, and MR DBDNN mutant expression constructs were subcloned by first generating the specified mutation in pTLBuMR using the QuikChange mutagenesis kit, followed by PCR amplification of the mutated sequence and subsequent insertion into pGSTGFP. The pGGMNL1–E959Q plasmid was constructed by replacing the fragment encoding amino acids 923–981 of MR in the GGMNL1– construct with the same fragment containing the point mutation E959Q described previously (17Htun H. Barsony J. Renyi I. Gould D.L. Hager G.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 4845-4850Crossref PubMed Scopus (327) Google Scholar). Expression of MR constructs in Sf9 cells was performed using the pIZ/V5-His expression vector (Invitrogen). The pGSTGFPMR constructs for expression in insect cells were prepared by cloning the relevant fragments from the mammalian expression vectors pGFPMR, pGFPMRΔ590–602, pGSTGFPNL0592/4/5A, pGSTGFPNL0592/4/5D, pGSTGFPNL0597/8/601A, pGSTGFPNL1, pGSTGFPNL1–, and pGSTGFPNL0597/8/601D (described above) into pIZ/V5-His. All expression vector inserts were verified by automated sequencing. The expression levels of all constructs were verified by Western analysis following transient transfection in COS-7 cells as described previously (20Sackey F.N. Haché R.J. Reich T. Kwast-Welfeld J. Lefebvre Y.A. Mol. Endocrinol. 1996; 10: 1191-1205PubMed Google Scholar). Cell Culture and Transient Transfection—COS-7 cells (American Type Culture Collection, CRL-1651) were maintained in high glucose Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum and nonessential amino acids. For subcellular distribution, COS-7 cells were transiently transfected using Lipofectamine™ (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's protocol. For each dish, between 0.5 and 1.0 μg of DNA was transfected using 8 μl of Lipofectamine reagent. The cells were incubated with the transfection mixture at 37 °C for 16 h. The transfection was stopped by adding an equal volume of phenol red-free Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 20% charcoal-stripped fetal bovine serum such that the final concentration of fetal bovine serum was 10%. For transcriptional assays, COS-7 cells were seeded in 6-well plates 24 h prior to transfection using Lipofectamine as described above. A total of 0.25 μg of plasmid DNA containing 100 ng of the reporter plasmid pMMTVLuc, 100 ng of pCMVβ-gal (Promega), and 25 ng of the indicated tested plasmids were transfected into each well. 48 h post-transfection, the cells were washed with PBS and lysed in reporter lysis buffer (Promega). 20 μl of extract were assayed for luciferase activity, and 50 μlof extract were assayed for β-galactosidase activity using following the manufacturer's instructions. Luciferase results were normalized for transfection efficiency using the β-galactosidase values for each transfection. The data presented represent an average of three independent experiments done in triplicates. Error bars were calculated as S.D. between the experiments. Sf9 cells were maintained in Trichoplusia ni Medium-Formulation Hink medium at 30 °C and transfected with Cellfectin (Invitrogen) according to the InsectSelect™ system protocol (Invitrogen) for transient expression in insect cells using 1 μg of DNA/60-mm dish and serum-free Grace's insect cell culture medium (Invitrogen) for transfection. Quantification of Subcellular Distribution—For analysis of subcellular distribution in COS-7 and HeLa cells, following transfection, the cells were cultured overnight in complete serum and then seeded onto 22-mm square coverslips. Cells were allowed to attach for 8 h. To restrict the synthesis of new receptor during the course of the experiment, cells were then synchronized in G0 by serum withdrawal for 16 h. Cells were treated with 1 μm cortisol, aldosterone, or spironolactone as indicated with cycloheximide included in some experiments. To initiate steroid withdrawal, cells were rinsed five times (5 min at 37 °C) in 1× PBS containing 5% (w/v) bovine serum albumin and then twice in serum-free medium. The cells were rinsed a final time in serum-free medium and incubated at 37 °C for the indicated withdrawal period. For direct visualization of GFP fluorescence, cells were fixed with 3% paraformaldehyde for 30 min at 4 °C, followed by incubation with PBS containing 0.2 m glycine for 10 min at 20 °C. Coverslips were mounted onto microscope slides, overlaid with 50% glycerol in PBS, and sealed with nail polish. Cells were scored into five categories from exclusively nuclear to exclusively cytoplasmic as described previously (22Savory J.G. Hsu B. Laquian I.R. Giffin W. Reich T. Haché R.J. Lefebvre Y.A. Mol.

Quantification was performed using double-blind encryption with individual data points derived from a minimum of 1000 cells quantified over three independent experiments performed in duplicate. For indirect immunofluorescence, following fixation in 3% paraformaldehyde and incubation with 0.2 mm glycine in PBS, cells were permeabilized by incubation with 0.5% Triton X-100 in PBS for 30 min at 20 °C. Cells were blocked with 5% normal goat serum in PBS for 1 h at 20 °C and then incubated at 4 °C with primary antibody. Following overnight incubation, the coverslips were washed three times in PBS and then incubated at 20 °C for 45 min with rhodamine red X-conjugated secondary antibody (Jackson ImmunoResearch Laboratories, Inc.) diluted in PBS (1:150 (v/v)). Cells were mounted onto glass coverslips as described for direct analysis of subcellular distribution. Following double-blind encryption, subcellular distribution was quantified as described previously (20Sackey F.N. Haché R.J. Reich T. Kwast-Welfeld J. Lefebvre Y.A. Mol.

Fluorescence Recovery after Photobleaching (FRAP) Assays—COS-7 and HeLa cells were seeded into Bioptechs delta T4 culture dishes. Transient transfection with the expression plasmids indicated was carried out using 500 ng of plasmid DNA and 8 μl of Lipofectamine per dish following the manufacturer's protocol. After overnight incubation in Opti-MEM serum-reduced medium, transfection was stopped by replacing the medium with phenol red-free complete medium containing 10% charcoal-stripped fetal bovine serum. Cells were grown in complete medium for 8 h and then withdrawn from the serum for 16 h prior to FRAP or fluorescence loss in photobleaching (FLIP) assays. 20 μg/ml cycloheximide was added 30 min prior to assays to inhibit de novo protein synthesis. Experiments were performed using a Bio-Rad MRC 1024 confocal microscope. For FRAP assays, the signal in the appropriate cellular compartment was ablated using 10–20 laser pulses at full power, and the fluorescence return over time was monitored. For FLIP assays, for each repetition, a portion of each cell was bleached for 5 s at full power, followed by recording an image of the whole cell at 3% laser power. This was repeated at 30-s intervals over a 10-min period. Analysis was performed using Bio-Rad LaserSharp and NIH Image-J software. In FRAP, for nuclear and cytoplasmic bleaching, results are expressed as a percentage of the total initial intensity in the entire cell prior to bleaching. For binuclear cells in which one nucleus was bleached, results are expressed as a percentage of the total initial intensity of fluorescence in both nuclei prior to bleaching. In FLIP, the results are expressed as a percentage of the fluorescence for the appropriate compartment at t = 0. All assays are the average of at least four independent trials. Error bars were calculated as S.D. between the trials. Rapid Nuclear Import of MR in Response to Ligand Is Mediated through a Bipartite NLS—In this study, we sought to examine the nuclear cytoplasmic trafficking of MR over periods of up to 24 h. As synthesis of new receptor during this time would have the potential to mask the behavior of the initial receptor population, we performed our experiments under conditions in which synthesis of new receptor was minimal. In previous experiments with GR, we observed that withdrawing serum from COS-7 cells for 16 h 1 day following transient transfection results in a pool of receptor that is stably maintained for periods of at least 48 h in what become G0-synchronized cells (20Sackey F.N. Haché R.J. Reich T. Kwast-Welfeld J. Lefebvre Y.A. Mol. Endocrinol. 1996; 10: 1191-1205PubMed Google Scholar). Furthermore, this receptor pool is maintained in the absence of appreciable new receptor synthesis. Expression of MR with an N-terminal BuGR epitope tag in COS-7 cells through a similar protocol yielded a pool of MR whose levels declined only slightly in the 24-h period beginning 16 h following the withdrawal of serum from the tissue culture medium. MR levels were not affected by cycloheximide treatment coincident with serum withdrawal (Fig. 1A), indicating that minimal synthesis of new receptor occurred during this time. Aldosterone treatment induced a reduction in MR levels over the 24-h period, an indication of a destabilization in response to steroid that is common to steroid receptors (42Wallace A.D. Cidlowski J.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 42714-42721Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (325) Google Scholar). This reduction in MR levels was also unaffected by cycloheximide treatment. To quantify MR localization through direct and indirect immunofluorescence, we employed a localization scoring protocol that we (20Sackey F.N. Haché R.J. Reich T. Kwast-Welfeld J. Lefebvre Y.A. Mol.

EMBO J. 1992; 11: 3681-3694Crossref PubMed Scopus (254) Google Scholar) have described previously. Using this approach, MR expressed in COS-7 cells was determined to be distributed evenly between the nucleus and cytoplasm in >80% of the cells (Fig. 1B). This was consistent with the results of earlier studies examining the localization of naïve MR (24Fejes-Toth G. Pearce D. Naray-Fejes-Toth A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Previous experiments with GR have shown that overexpression of the receptor in COS-7 cells results in an artificial shift of the receptor toward the nucleus (44Sanchez E.R. Hirst M. Scherrer L.C.

Hirst M.A. Ringold G.M. Housley P.R. Mol. Endocrinol. 1991; 5: 217-225Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). However, this appeared unlikely to explain the partial nuclear accumulation of MR here, as our MR constructs were expressed at levels 4–6-fold lower than similarly tagged GRs (data not shown) that were localized almost exclusively to the cytoplasm in parallel experiments (Fig. 1B). Upon steroid treatment, both MR and GR transferred rapidly and completely to the nucleus (Fig. 1B). Nuclear receptors characteristically possess a major NLS (termed NL1) that is composed of basic amino acids at the C-terminal region of the receptor DNA-binding domain. For rat GR, amino acids 510–517 compose the core of the NLS and are required for NL1 activity (Fig. 1C). Alignment of MR with GR revealed a potentially disruptive two-amino acid (LG) insertion within the analogous basic amino acid cluster of MR. However, a second basic motif between amino acids 488 and 493 that may supplement the NLS activity of the core NL1 motif of GR (46Tang Y. Ramakrishnan C. Thomas J. DeFranco D.B. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1997; 8: 795-809Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar) was precisely represented in MR. Asparagine substitutions at lysine residues in the second basic cluster of GR have been shown previously to completely abrogate GR NL1 activity (GRNL1–) and to restrict overexpressed and antagonist-treated GR to the cytoplasm (22Savory J.G. Hsu B. Laquian I.R. Giffin W. Reich T. Haché R.J. Lefebvre Y.A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 1025-1037Crossref PubMed Scopus (182) Google Scholar). The analogous substitutions in MR (MRNL1–) (Fig. 1C) had only a modest effect on the localization of naïve MR, with the receptor remaining mostly nuclear or evenly distributed between the nucleus and cytoplasm in ∼65% of the cells (Fig. 1D). Upon steroid treatment, nuclear transfer of MRNL1– was reduced"

There are three major branches of MAPK signaling that include ERK, c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK) and p38. The JNK and p38 branches of the MAPK family are activated by stress stimuli including cytokines, osmotic stress, mitogens, UV irradiation, chemotherapeutic agents, and anisomycin (1Stadheim T.A. Kucera G.L. Leuk. Res. 2002; 26: 55-65Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar, 2Mao X. Bravo I.G. Cheng H. Alonso A. Exp. Cell Res. 2004; 292: 304-311Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). There are three kinases that form a MAPK signaling module where a MAPK is activated by a MAPK kinase (MAPKK), which in turn is regulated by a MAPKK kinase (MAPKKK) (Fig. 1). The upstream activation of JNK and p38 is complex, allowing for activation of this pathway in multiple cells and by multiple stimuli. Cellular and receptor specificity of the pathway is conferred by protein-protein interactions where the MAPK and a MAPKK assemble with a specific MAPKKK on scaffold proteins such as JNK-interacting protein (3Manning A.M. Davis R.J. Nat. Rev. Drug Discov. 2003; 2: 554-565Crossref PubMed Scopus (534) Google Scholar, 4Yasuda J. Whitmarsh A.J. Cavanagh J. Sharma M. Davis R.J. Mol. Cell.

Science. 2000; 290: 1574-1577Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The resulting signaling module acts as a bridge joining the appropriate receptor to the downstream effectors, enabling activation of the stress-activated MAPK. The most distal point at which signal and cell specificity for JNK and p38 activation is conferred is at the MAPKKK level. Mixed lineage kinases (MLKs) are a family of MAPKKKs activating JNK and p38. There are currently seven mammalian kinases belonging to the MLK family that have recently been reviewed (6Gallo K.A. Johnson G.L. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2002; 3: 663-672Crossref PubMed Scopus (453) Google Scholar, 7Maroney A.C. Saporito M.S. Hudkins R.L. Curr. Med. Chem. 2002; 2: 143-155Google Scholar). These kinases can be divided into three subclasses based on sequence similarity and domain structure, and they include MLK1-4, dual leucine zipper kinases, and the zipper sterile α-motif kinases (ZAKs). Although much is known about the mechanisms regulating MLK interaction with downstream MAPKK and MAPK substrates, specific stimuli that activate MLKs and the physiologic roles of distinct MLKs are not as well characterized. Within the MLK family of enzymes, a physiological role for MLK3 has been the most extensively studied. Overexpression studies with a dominant/negative MLK3 inhibitor and gene-silencing studies with MLK3 small interfering RNA (siRNA) suggest a role for this kinase, respectively, in transforming growth factor-β-induced apoptosis (8Cho Y.Y. Bode A.M. Mizuno H. Choi B.Y. Choi H.S. Dong Z. Cancer Res. 2004; 64: 3855-3864Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar) and cytokine- and mitogen-induced JNK and p38 activation (9Chadee D.N. Kyriakis J.M. Nat. Cell Biol. 2004; 6: 770-776Crossref PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar). A role for the MLKs from subclass 1 (MLK1, 2, and 3) in neuronal cell death has been suggested through the use of overexpression and dominant/negative inhibitor mutants in neuronal cell culture (6Gallo K.A. Johnson G.L. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2002; 3: 663-672Crossref PubMed Scopus (453) Google Scholar, 7Maroney A.C. Saporito M.S. Hudkins R.L. Curr. Med.

This role for MLKs has been further substantiated through the use of CEP-1347, a potent small molecule inhibitor of MLK1-3 (11Maroney A.C. Finn J.P. Connors T.J. Durkin J.T. Angeles T. Gessner G.

MLK7 is a splice variant of the first identified member of this class, a leucine zipper, and ZAK (also called MRK-α or MLTK-α) (16Gotoh I. Adachi M. Nishida E. J. Biol.

Another study using ectopic expression in JB6C141 skin epidermal cells suggests a role for the enzyme in neoplastic transformation (8Cho Y.Y. Bode A.M. Mizuno H. Choi B.Y. Choi H.S. Dong Z. Cancer Res. 2004; 64: 3855-3864Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). We have previously shown that transgenic mice with cardiac-restricted overexpression of MLK7 (MLK7 Tg) have increased p38 pathway activation and characteristics of a cardiac compensatory phenotype. When exposed to chronic β-adrenergic stimulation, the Tg mice rapidly deteriorated and demonstrated increased mortality compared with wild type controls. Simultaneous activation of JNK and p38 in heart tissue from the MLK7 Tg mice suggested that stress associated with adrenergic stimulation increased the activity of MLK7 and may contribute to cardiac decompensation during periods of acute cardiac stress (22Christe M. Jin N. Wang X. Gould K.E. Iversen P.W. Yu X. Lorenz J.N. Kadambi V. Zuckerman S.H. Bloem L.J. J. Mol. Cell.

To further define the requirement of MLK7 for MAPK activation in the presence of cellular stresses and identify potential physiological roles for the enzyme, we identified small molecule inhibitors of MLK7 catalytic function. The study described here reports on the discovery of an aryl-substituted dihydropyrrolopyrazole quinoline (DHP-2) as a potent inhibitor of MLK7 catalytic function. This compound, along with gene silencing utilizing MLK7 siRNA analysis, demonstrates that MLK7 is the MAPKKK responsible for JNK and p38 pathway activation downstream of anisomycin and UV stimulation. However, the inhibitory effects were not obtained when the pathway was activated by either TNF-α or IL-1β. Additionally, MLK7 inhibition with DHP-2 protected cells from apoptotic cell death induced by these stimuli. Furthermore, treatment of MLK7 transgenic mice resulted in significant reduction of p38 and JNK pathway activation in heart tissue, suggesting that this compound will be a useful tool to further define the physiological role of MLK7. Compounds and Reagents—The DHP compounds were prepared as reported by Sawyer et al. (23Sawyer J.S. Beight D.W. Britt K.S. Anderson B.D. Campbell R.M. Goodson T.J. K H.D. Y L.H. McMillen W.T. Mort N.

Goodson T.J. Mader M.M. Toth J.E. Chem. Abstr. 2004; 141: 2358Google Scholar) with the key synthetic intermediate being DHP bromide (7-bromo-(2-dihydro-4H-pyrrolo[1,2-b]pyrazol-3-yl)-quinoline). The DHP bromide was reacted with various aryl boronic acids in dioxane and 2 m aqueous K2CO3 in the presence of catalytic Pd2(dba)3 (tris(dibenzylideneacetone)dipalladium(0)) and triphenylphosphine to provide the DHP products. Alternatively, the DHP bromide was converted to its corresponding boronic acid and reacted with commercially available aryl bromides under the same conditions of palladium catalysis. Complete synthetic details and reaction scheme are found under Supplemental Data. Products were purified by high pressure liquid chromatography. Protein Expression and Purification—An N-terminal glutathione S-transferase (GST)-tagged MLK7 was expressed and purified from Sf9 insect cells as described previously (25Yu X.H. Bloem L.J. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2003; 310: 452-457Crossref PubMed Scopus (5) Google Scholar). For MLK2 expression and purification, the cDNA corresponding to the catalytic domain (amino acids 1-444) was amplified from Human Brain Marathon Ready cDNA Library (Clontech) using the primers P1 (5′-CTGTGTGAAGCGGCCTCCCGCAGCC-3′) and P2 (5′-CTTCTCCTGGCTCAGCTGGCACATG-3′) and the nested primer P3 (5′-GAGGCGCGCCGCCACCATGGAGGAGGAGGGGC-3′). The PCR fragment was cloned into pCRSCRIPT SK+, and the resulting plasmid was digested with NcoI/NotI, the 1357-bp fragment purified and cloned into pACGHLT-B baculoviral transfer vector (BD Biosciences) that was modified using two synthetic linkers (5′-CATGGGAGCTAAACGCGGCCGCACGGCTCCCACTAATA-3′ and 5′-GATCTATTAGTGGGAGCCGTGCGGCCGCGTTTAGCTCC-3′). The resulting plasmid coded for an N-terminal GST-tagged MLK2 from residue 1-444 with nine additional C-terminal residues (GLER-PHGSH) followed by two stop codons. The transfer vector encoding GST-MLK2-(1-444) was co-transfected with BacuoloGold Linearized Baculovirus DNA (BD Biosciences) into SF9 cells using Lipofectin reagent (Invitrogen) to form recombinant baculovirus. Purification of the overexpressed GST-MLK2 was similar to that described for MLK7. In Vitro Kinase Activity Measurement—MLK7 and MLK2 kinase activities were measured using a filter binding assay as described previously (25Yu X.H. Bloem L.J. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2003; 310: 452-457Crossref PubMed Scopus (5) Google Scholar). Kinase inhibitory activity of compounds was evaluated from 10-point dose response curves (0.001-20 μm), single well for each dose. Data were analyzed using a 4-parameter sigmoidal dose response equation and IC50 values calculated from the resulting curve. For inhibitor modality analysis, a pentahistidine-tagged version of MLK7 (50 nm) (15Bloem L.J. Pickard T.R. Acton S. Donoghue M. Beavis R.C. Knierman M.D. Wang X. J. Mol. Cell. Cardiol. 2001; 33: 1739-1750Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar) was incubated in a reaction mixture containing DHP-8 (0-0.2 nm), 5 μm myelin basic protein (MBP), 4 mm dithiothreitol, 5 mm MgCl2, 0.5 μCi/well [γ-33P]ATP and cold ATP (3.75-120 μm ATP). Incubation was carried out for 2 h at room temperature, stopped with 10% phosphoric acid, transferred to a Millipore MAPHN0B50 filter, and aspirated. The filter plates were washed with 0.5% H3PO4 three times and counted on a Packard Top-count. Data were analyzed using double-reciprocal plots of velocity expressed as picomole phosphate/minute versus ATP concentration. Ki was determined from a plot of the slopes obtained from the double reciprocal plots at each concentration of DHP-8. MLK7 Cell-based Assay—MLK7 inhibitory activity of compounds in cells was determined using a co-transfection system of MLK7 with JNK. Transfection of cells was described previously with the exception that transfections were carried out in 96-well plates and medium was removed after 6 h of transfection and replaced with DMEM, 0.5% FBS (25Yu X.H. Bloem L.J. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2003; 310: 452-457Crossref PubMed Scopus (5) Google Scholar). On the second day after transfection, medium was again aspirated and 100 μl of fresh medium (DMEM, 0.5% FBS) containing serial dilutions of compound (0.0005-10 μm) were added, each dose in duplicate. Incubation was continued for 2 h at 37 °C, at which time medium was removed and pJNK levels in the cells were determined using phosphospecific JNK antibodies formatted either as the BioPlex pJNK assay kit (Bio-Rad) according to the manufacturer's protocol or as a cellular ELISA. For cellular ELISA, medium was removed and cells were fixed in PBS supplemented with 8% formaldehyde for 20 min followed by four washes with PBS supplemented with 0.1% Triton X-100, 5 min each wash with shaking. Plates were incubated with 0.6% H2O2 in PBS supplemented with 0.1% Tween 20 (PBST) for 20 min at room temperature with shaking followed by four washes in PBST. Blocking was performed at room temperature for 1.5 h with 10% FBS in PBST, and the plates were rinsed once with PBST and then incubated with 1:500 dilution of pJNK antibody (Cell Signaling) at 4 °C overnight. The following day, plates were washed four times with PBST, incubated for 1 h at room temperature with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated anti-rabbit IgG, and subsequently washed three times in PBST and twice with PBS, 5-min wash each with shaking. Antibody binding was detected using FEMTO Super Signal (Pierce), and luminescence was measured on a Dynex MCX microtiter plate luminometer. Data were analyzed, and IC50 was determined using a four-parameter sigmoidal dose response equation. The variability of pJNK quantification assays was <10%, and a bridging study of 30 compounds taken through both methods of detection gave highly correlated IC50 values (r2 = 0.903 within the expected variability of the assays (minimum significant ratio = 3). Cell Stimulation and siRNA—COS-7 cells were maintained in DMEM, 5% FBS. For siRNA transfections, DMEM (1.5 ml) was incubated with 60 μl of TransIT-TKO (Mirus, MIR2150) at room temperature for 8 min and then mixed with 37.5 μl of 40 μm MLK7 siRNA (5′-CCUCAAGUCAAGAAACGUUdTdT-3′ and 5′-AACGUUUCUUGACUUGCGGdTdT-3′) or nonspecific siRNA (Control X, Dharmacon) and incubation continued at room temperature for an additional 8-16 min. Cells were harvested and adjusted to 3.2 × 105 cells/ml, and 1.0 ml of siRNA/Transit-TKO mixture was added to 9.0 ml of cells, mixed, and dispensed in a 24-well poly-d-lysine dish (500 μl/well). The following day, the siRNA mixture was removed and replaced with fresh medium, and incubation continued for 2 more days and then cells were stimulated as described in the following paragraph. After stimulation, cells were lyzed and submitted to Western blot analysis for phosphorylated MAPKs as described previously for MLK7 (15Bloem L.J. Pickard T.R. Acton S. Donoghue M. Beavis R.C.

For cellular stimulation in the presence of DHP-2, COS-7 cells were plated at a density of 2.0 × 105 cells/well of a 24-well plate in DMEM supplemented with 5% FBS and incubated for 6 h at 37 °C followed by incubation overnight in DMEM supplemented with 0.5% FBS and treated for 90 min with 200 nm DHP-2 prior to stimulation. Cells were stimulated with anisomycin (10 μg/ml, 30 min), TNF-α (10 ng/ml, 15 min), IL-1β (10 ng/ml, 15 min), 2.0 mm H2O2 (15 min), 80 or 800 J/M2 UV irradiation (wave length = 254 nm), or 0.5 m NaCl (5 min). DNA Fragmentation Assay—COS-7 cells were plated in a 24-well plate using DMEM supplemented with 5% FBS. After overnight incubation at 37 °C, cells were pretreated with DHP-2 at 200 nm for 1 h and stimulated with either 800 J/M2 UV light or anisomycin at 10 μg/ml followed by overnight incubation. The following day, DNA fragmentation analysis was performed using the Cell Death Detection ELISA Kit (Roche Applied Science) according to the manufacturer's suggested protocol. Means ± S.E. were determined, and the data were analyzed by a two-tailed Student's t test. MLK7 Transgenic in Vivo Analysis—MLK7 Tg were generated as described previously (22Christe M. Jin N. Wang X.

Mice were dosed by oral gavage with vehicle (0.5% carboxymethyl cellulose, 0.1% polysorbate 80) or the indicated amount of compound and were sacrificed 1 h post-dose by CO2 asphyxiation after which heart ventricles were harvested and frozen in liquid nitrogen. For isoproterenol stimulation, animals were dosed with intraperitoneal injection of 15 mg/kg isoproterenol in sterile saline 45 min after oral gavage of either vehicle or compound and heart tissues were harvested 15 min after isoproterenol stimulation. Tissue homogenates were prepared and analyzed by Western blot as described previously. The use of mice was approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committees of the American Association for Accreditation of Laboratory animal Care-accredited institutions (Eli Lilly and Company). Identifying MLK7 Inhibitors—We have previously demonstrated that GST-fused MLK7 has kinase activity when overexpressed and purified from Sf9 cells (25Yu X.H. Bloem L.J. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2003; 310: 452-457Crossref PubMed Scopus (5) Google Scholar). For compound screening, GST-MLK7 was purified to homogeneity and a filter binding assay for MLK7 catalytic function with MBP as substrate was developed. Using this assay, DHP-1 (Table I) was identified as a potent inhibitor of MLK7 catalytic function with an IC50 of 48 nm. This compound was unsubstituted on the pendant aryl ring. A series of 7-aryl-substituted dihydropyrrolopyrazole quinolines was synthesized (Table I) with variation at the ortho, meta, and para positions for comparison with DHP-1. Ortho substitution by hydroxyl, amino, or carboxylic acid groups (DHP-5, DHP-6, and DHP-7, respectively) resulted in a 6-20-fold decreased activity in the MLK7 filter binding assay. However, the carboxylic acid group was well tolerated in the para position (DHP-3, MLK7 IC50 15 nm), as was a carboxamide (DHP-4, MLK7 IC50 23 nm). DHP-2, substituted at the meta position by fluorine and para by amino, was found to be comparably active in MLK7 to the monosubstituted carboxylic acid and carboxamide derivatives (IC50 17 nm). DHP-8, in which a thiophene rather than a phenyl ring substituted the 7-position of the quinoline, was also found to be active (MLK7 IC50 11 nm). The thiophene can be regarded as an isostere of the phenyl ring in that the enzymatic activity of DHP-8 is comparable to that of DHP-1. The compounds all demonstrated IC50 > 20 μm in a MLK2 filter binding assay using MBP as substrate, suggesting that the dihydropyrrolopyrazole quinolines are specific for MLK7 over other members of the mixed lineage family of kinases. Inhibitor modality analysis of this class of compounds was determined using the MBP filter binding assay with varying concentrations of DHP-8 (IC50 11 nm) and ATP. The Lineweaver-Burke plot of the resulting data revealed the dihydropyrrolopyrazole quinolines to be ATP-competitive inhibitors of MLK7 catalytic function (Ki = 1.5 nm) (Fig. 2A).Table IInhibitory activity of compounds in MLK7 in vitro kinase assay (MLK7 pMBP), COS-7 cell co-transfection assay (COS pJNK), or MLK2 in vitro kinase assay (MLK2 pMBP) Asterisk, IC50 values are means of two or three individual experiments. Open table in a new tab Compounds with IC50 < 500 nm in the filter binding assay were tested for the ability to inhibit MLK7 catalytic activity in the cell. COS-7 cells were co-transfected with MLK7 and JNK, and the amount of pJNK formed was measured using a pJNK cellular ELISA. We have demonstrated previously that there is no formation of pJNK in this co-transfection assay without the presence of active MLK7. The IC50 data shown in Table I reveal DHP-2 and DHP-8 to be the most potent inhibitors of MLK7 cellular activity with a mean IC50 of 0.075 and 0.052 μm, respectively. In contrast, the unsubstituted DHP, DHP-1, and the 4-carboxyl-substituted aryls, DHP-3 and DHP-4, demonstrated IC50 values of 1.0, 2.1, and 0.45 μm, respectively. As expected, based on the relative in vitro potencies, 2-OH-substituted aryl had the least activity with a IC50 of 6.2 μm. MLK7 resides at the MAPKKK level of JNK and p38 signal transduction pathways, and as shown in Fig. 1, a MAPKK resides between JNK and MLK7. To confirm that the compounds were acting at the MAPKKK level and not at the MAPKK level, MLK7 was co-transfected with MKK4 and the resulting pMKK4 formed was measured by cellular ELISA. The IC50 values generated for compounds in this assay were in good agreement with those generated from the JNK co-transfections, suggesting that the compounds are active upstream of MAPKK (r2 = 0.907). Since DHP-2 demonstrated the most potent MLK7 cellular inhibition as well as the most ideal solubility and metabolic stability in human microsomal studies (data not shown), this compound was chosen for further analysis. Representative individual experiments determining dose response curves of DHP-2 in MLK7 in vitro kinase assay, as well as MLK7/JNK and MLK7/MKK4 co-transfection assays, are shown in Fig. 2, B-D, respectively. MLK7 Is the MAPKKK Responsible for Anisomycin and UV-induced p38 and JNK Activation—Although it is clear that MLK7 activates p38 and JNK, cellular stresses that stimulate MLK7 activation have not been well defined. In the following set of experiments, DHP-2 was used as a tool to identify cellular stressors that may be activating JNK and p38 through the MAPKKK MLK7. Thus, cultured COS-7 cells were pretreated with 200 nm DHP-2 and then stimulated with anisomycin, IL1-β, TNF-α, H2O2, NaCl, or ultraviolet radiation. Cellular lysates were collected, and Western blots were analyzed with antibodies to phosphorylated or total JNK and p38. The results shown in Fig. 3 demonstrate that the MLK7 inhibitor DHP-2 at 200 nm completely blocked both JNK and p38 activation downstream of anisomycin and UV radiation. In contrast, the compound had no effect on activation of the stress-activated MAPKs downstream of cytokine stimulation. The compound partially blocked p38 activation in response to hyperosmotic stress but had no effect on H2O2-induced p38 activation. The effect of DHP-2 on JNK activation by these two stresses could not be determined due to low level of activation in COS-7 cells. These data suggest that MLK7 is the MAPKKK involved in anisomycin and UV-induced signal transduction but not cytokine activation of JNK and p38. Additionally, the data further demonstrate the specificity of DHP-2 at the MAPKKK level, because all four of these stresses are believed to activate JNK and p38 activation through the same MAPKKs but different MAPKKKs (Fig. 1). To further demonstrate the specificity of DHP-2 for MLK7, 10-point dose response curves (0.15 nm-3.0 μm) for the inhibition of anisomycin, UV, IL-1β, or TNF-α-phosphorylated JNK and p38 were determined using the appropriate cellular ELISAs. The resulting IC50 values for anisomycin and UV pJNK formation of 0.018 and 0.026 μm, respectively (Table II), are nearly identical and have similar potency to the IC50 reported for pJNK inhibition in the MLK7/JNK co-transfection assay (IC50 = 0.075 μm). The IC50 values for phosphorylated p38 formation downstream of anisomycin (0.014 μm) and UV radiation (0.020 μm) are nearly identical to those of pJNK inhibition for the same stimuli. The similar IC50 values for all of these assays provide further evidence that DHP-2 is blocking MAPK activation by inhibiting MLK7, the kinase common to both p38 and JNK activation by these stimuli in COS-7 cells. Additionally, the dose response curves suggest IC50 of >3.0 μm for IL1-β an"

Actin may play a role in formation of an active signaling complex, or actin may be required for movement of vesicles to the plasma membrane surface. To distinguish between these possibilities, we examined the ability of myr-Akt, a constitutively active form of Akt that signals GLUT4 translocation to the plasma membrane in the absence of insulin, to signal translocation of an HA-GLUT4-GFP reporter protein in the presence or absence of an intact cytoskeleton in 3T3-L1 adipocytes. Expression of myr-Akt signaled the redistribution of the GLUT4 reporter protein to the cell surface in the absence or presence of 10 μm latrunculin B, a concentration sufficient to completely inhibit insulin-dependent redistribution of the GLUT4 reporter to the cell surface. These data suggest that the actin network plays a primary role in organization of the insulin-signaling complex. To further support this conclusion, we measured the activation of known signaling proteins using a saturating concentration of insulin in cells pretreated without or with 10 μm latrunculin B. We found that latrunculin treatment did not affect insulin-dependent tyrosine phosphorylation of the insulin receptor β-subunit and IRS-1 but completely inhibited activation of Akt/PKB enzymatic activity. Phosphorylation of Akt/PKB at Ser-473 and Thr-308 was inhibited by latrunculin B treatment, indicating that the defect in signaling lies prior to Akt/PKB activation. In summary, our data support the hypothesis that the actin network plays a role in organization of the insulin-signaling complex but is not required for vesicle trafficking and/or fusion.

In summary, our data support the hypothesis that the actin network plays a role in organization of the insulin-signaling complex but is not required for vesicle trafficking and/or fusion. A major physiologic action of insulin in peripheral tissues is to stimulate the translocation of the facilitative glucose transporter (GLUT4) to the cell surface, leading to enhanced glucose uptake and storage in these tissues. Defects in the translocation process are thought to be responsible for insulin resistance and precede the development of Type 2 diabetes in susceptible individuals (1Rothman D.L. Magnusson I.

To understand the defects in insulin-mediated GLUT4 translocation, we must first develop a thorough understanding of the cellular and molecular mechanisms that underlie the translocation process. The pool of GLUT4 vesicles that responds to insulin is biochemically distinct from GLUT4 vesicle populations that redistribute to the plasma membrane under other stimuli such as GTPγS (2Millar C.A.

The precise physical characteristics of the insulin-responsive compartment and the mechanism for intracellular retention have not been established.

Increased exocytosis may result from increased fission of GLUT4 vesicles from an endosomal precursor, stimulation of the rate of movement of vesicles to the plasma membrane, increased fusion of vesicles with the plasma membrane, or a combination of two or more of these processes. The notion that two or more steps in insulin-dependent GLUT4 translocation may be affected by insulin stimulation is consistent with the observation that translocation is stimulated by several individual pathways within the insulin-signaling cascade (17Czech M.P.

A requirement for the actin network at a step prior to Akt/PKB activation would be entirely consistent with a role for actin in organization of the insulin-signaling complex. Indeed, our data support a role for the actin network in the organization of the insulin signal leading to Akt/PKB activation, thus supporting a role for actin in signal transduction. Cell Culture—3T3-L1 fibroblasts were obtained from the American Type Tissue Culture repository (Manassas, VA), cultured at 37 °C in 5% CO2, and maintained in DMEM containing 25 mm glucose and 10% calf serum. Confluent cultures were induced to differentiate by incubation of the cells with DMEM plus 25 mm glucose, 10% fetal bovine serum, 175 nm insulin, 1 μm dexamethasone, and 0.5 mm isobutyl-1-methylxanthine. After 4 days the medium was changed to DMEM containing 25 mm glucose, 10% fetal bovine serum, and 175 nm insulin with the incubation period continuing for an additional 3 days. Electroporation—100-millimeter plates of 3T3-L1 adipocytes 5 days post-differentiation were washed with PBS and incubated for 10 min with 2 ml of trypsin/EDTA and 2 ml of PBS with 4 mg of collagenase. Cells were resuspended and pelleted at 900 rpm for 5 min. Cells were washed with PBS and resuspended in 3 ml of DMEM containing 25 mm glucose. 0.5 ml of cell suspension was transferred to a 0.4-cm electroporation cuvette (Bio-Rad), and 45 μg of DNA was added. Cells were electroporated in a Gene Pulser II (Bio-Rad) at 0.18 kV and 950 microfarad. Cells were allowed to recover for 10 min at room temperature. Equivalent amounts of cell suspension and fresh media were added together and plated on 4-chamber BD Falcon CultureSlides (BD Biosciences). All experiments were conducted 18–24 h post-electroporation. GLUT4 Translocation Assay—3T3-L1 adipocytes electroporated with HA-GLUT4-GFP and either myr-Akt or control plasmid were starved for 2 h in serum-free F-12 Hamm's medium with or without 10 μm latrunculin B. Cells were treated with or without 100 nm insulin in serum-free F-12 Hamm's medium for 30 min. For dose response, cells were treated with 1, 3, 10, 30, and 100 nm insulin in serum-free F-12 Hamm's medium for 30 min. Cells were washed twice in PBS and fixed with 3% paraformaldehyde in PBS for 20 min. Cells were quenched for 10 min in 0.05 m ammonium chloride in PBS. Cells were incubated with α-HA antibody (Covance), and the antibody was detected using anti-mouse IgG conjugated with Alexa 568 (Molecular Probes, Eugene, OR). The cells were analyzed by confocal microscopy using a Leica TNS confocal microscope (Deerfield, IL). Images displayed were compiled from sections and represent the entire z axis of the cells (12 sections of 0.5–1.5 μm separation). Image analysis and quantification of the GFP and HA were performed using the Leica LCS Lite software.

Whole Cell Detergent Lysates—One hundred-millimeter plates of treated 3T3-L1 adipocytes were washed twice with ice-cold Tris-buffered saline followed by freezing in liquid nitrogen. The plates were thawed on ice and scraped into 1 ml of 1% Nonidet P-40 lysis buffer (1% Nonidet P-40, 20 mm HEPES (pH 7.4), and 2 mm EDTA) containing phosphatase inhibitors (100 mm sodium fluoride, 10 mm sodium pyrophosphate, 1 mm sodium vanadate, and 1 mm molybdate) and protease inhibitors (10 μm leupeptin, 10 μg/ml aprotinin, 1.5 mm pepstatin A, and1mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride). The cells were lysed on ice for 20 min, and insoluble material was removed by microcentrifugation for 10 min at 4 °C. Protein concentrations of the detergent lysates were determined by a Bradford protein assay (Pierce) using the manufacturer's specifications. Gels were loaded with 2 μg of total protein/sample. Electrophoresis and Immunoblotting—Samples were fractionated using SDS-PAGE and transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride membranes (Millipore) in transfer buffer (25 mm Tris, 193 mm glycine, pH 8.5) for 3–4 amp hours at 4 °C. Anti-phosphotyrosine blots were carried out using the PY99 monoclonal antibody (Santa Cruz Biotechnology). Phospho-PKB/Akt1 antibody specific for either Ser-473 or Thr-308 and anti-PKB/Akt antibodies were obtained from New England Biolabs. Anti-insulin receptor β-subunit and anti-IRS antibodies were from Santa Cruz Biotechnology. Immunoblots were visualized and quantified by infrared spectrophotometry (LiCor, Lincoln, NE). Phosphoinositide 3-Kinase Activity Assay—Phosphoinsositide (PI) 3-kinase activity was assayed in anti-phosphotyrosine immunoprecipitates of whole cell detergent lysates as described previously (30Knight J.B. Cao K.T. Gibson G.V. Olson A.L. Endocrinology. 2000; 141: 208-218Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). The immunoprecipitation was carried out using the PY-99 anti-phosphotyrosine antibody (Santa Cruz Biotechnology). PKB/Akt Activity Assay—Total PKB/Akt activity was measured from immunoprecipitates of whole cell detergent lysates using the GSK3 fusion protein as a substrate. The enzyme assay was performed using a commercially obtained kit according to the manufacturer's specifications (Cell Signaling, Beverly, MA). Subcellular Fractionation of 3T3-L1 Adipocytes—3T3-L1 adipocytes were fractionated by ultracentrifugation to obtain discrete internal membrane fractions, plasma membranes, and a cytosolic fraction. One hundred-millimeter plates of treated cells were washed twice with cold PBS and scraped into 2.25 ml of TES buffer (20 mm Tris (pH 7.5), 255 mm sucrose, 2 mm EDTA, 100 mm sodium fluoride, 10 mm sodium pyrophosphate, 1 mm sodium vanadate, 1 mm molybdate, 10 μm leupeptin, 10 μg/ml aprotinin, 1.5 mm pepstatin A, and 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride). Samples were homogenized (20 strokes in a Dounce homogenizer, pestle A) and centrifuged at 16,000 × gmax (JA-17 rotor at 10,000 rpm, Beckman Coulter, Inc., Palo Alto, CA) for 15 min. The pellet was resuspended in TES, and centrifugation was repeated as described above. The 16,000 × gmax pellet consisted of nuclei, mitochondria, and plasma membrane. Plasma membrane fragments were isolated by resuspending the 16,000 × gmax pellet in TES buffer, homogenized (20 strokes in a Dounce homogenizer, pestle B), and layered over a 1.15 m sucrose cushion (TES buffer containing 1.15 m sucrose). The plasma membrane fragments were isolated from the interface between the sucrose cushion and the homogenate. The plasma membrane fractions were diluted in TES buffer and pelleted by centrifugation at 48,000 × gmax for 45 min. The 16,000 × gmax supernatants were combined and centrifuged at 50,000 × gmax (Beckman Coulter, Inc.; SW60 rotor at 19,000 rpm) for 20 min to produce a low speed pellet. A high speed pellet was sedimented from the second supernatant by centrifugation at 180,000 × gmax (SW60 rotor at 37,000 rpm) for 60 min. The resulting supernatant was centrifuged for 90 min at 360,000 × gmax (SW60 rotor at 52,000 rpm) to produce a very high speed pellet. The pellets were resuspended in homogenization buffer and solubilized in Laemmli buffer. The total protein concentration of the fractions was determined by Bradford assay. Statistical Analysis—Statistical analysis was performed using the Analyze-It software for Microsoft Excel (Analyze-It Software, Ltd., Leeds, UK) GLUT4 Translocation in 3T3-L1 Adipoctyes Expressing myr-Akt without a Functional Actin Network—Previous work from several laboratories has demonstrated that a functional actin network is necessary for insulin-mediated GLUT4 translocation (19Tsakiridis T.

To better understand the molecular basis of the actin network requirement, we tested the effect of expressing a constitutively active Akt/PKB (myr-Akt) on GLUT4 translocation without a functional actin network. Constitutive targeting of Akt1/PKBα to the membrane (myr-Akt) activates its kinase activity (31Kohn A.D. Takeuchi F. Roth R.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 21920-21926Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (407) Google Scholar) and signals the redistribution of GLUT4 translocation in the absence of insulin and presence of wortmannin (32Kohn A.D.

This membrane modification appears to allow Akt1/PBKα to substitute for Akt2/PKBβ, the isoform previously shown to function upstream of GLUT4 translocation (34Cho H. Mu J. Kim J.K. Thorvaldsen J.L.

In this experiment, we used the myr-Akt construct to bypass proximal insulin signaling and test whether the actin network was required upstream or downstream of Akt/PKB activation in GLUT4 translocation. 3T3-L1 adipocytes expressing transfected myr-Akt or control plasmid were treated with latrunculin B to depolymerize the actin network. GLUT4 translocation was measured using a HA-GLUT4-GFP reporter molecule that exposes the HA epitope after the protein has fused with the plasma membrane (10Lampson M.A. Schmoranzer J. Zeigerer A. Simon S.M. McGraw T.E. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2001; 12: 3489-3501Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar, 36Quon M.J. Butte A.J. Zarnowski M.J. Sesti G. Cushman S.W. Taylor S.I. J. Biol.

Treatment of control cells with either 100 nm insulin stimulation for 30 min or by co-expression of myr-Akt increases HA staining on the cell surface (Fig. 1A–C). To quantify translocation, the level of exposed HA binding was normalized to the total amount of reporter protein by measuring the fluorescence intensity of GFP. These ratios are shown in Fig. 1G and demonstrate that insulin and myr-Akt stimulated GLUT4 translocation 8- and 12-fold, respectively, over basal conditions. When cells were treated with latrunculin B, insulin was unable to cause significant translocation over basal (Fig. 1E). Myr-Akt retained the ability to cause GLUT4 translocation in latrunculin B-treated cells (Fig. 1F). Quantification of the ratio of surface HA to GFP revealed that myr-Akt caused a significantly higher proportion of HA to be exposed in latrunculin B-treated cells compared with control cells (Fig. 1G). GLUT4 Cycles in 3T3-L1 Adipocytes Expressing myr-Akt— Insulin stimulation increases cycling of GLUT4 between intracellular vesicles and the cell surface (38Karylowski O. Zeigerer A. Cohen A. McGraw T.E. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2004; 15: 870-882Crossref PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar). We next tested whether myr-Akt also increased GLUT4 cycling in 3T3-L1 cells. GLUT4 cycling was measured by quantifying HA antibody uptake in the presence or absence of insulin or myr-Akt. 3T3-L1 adipocytes transfected with the HA-GLUT4-GFP reporter and either empty vector or myr-Akt were incubated in medium containing 10 mg/ml anti-HA antibody with or without 100 nm insulin for 30 min. Following this incubation, excess surface antibody was removed by light acid wash, and the cells were fixed and permeabilized. To confirm that the washing conditions were sufficient to wash away surface-bound HA antibody, a parallel experiment was performed using non-permeabilized cells (data not shown). The HA antibody was detected using Alexa 568-conjugated secondary antibody. The ratio of HA staining to GFP staining was quantified by confocal microscopy. Significant internalized HA antibody was measured in both insulin-treated cells and cells expressing myr-Akt compared with basal (Fig. 2, A–D). Quantitative analysis confirmed that there was a 7–9-fold increase in internalized HA antibody in cells treated with insulin or expressing constitutively active Akt/PKB (Fig. 2E). When the cells expressing myr-Akt were treated with latrunculin B, there was a 50% decrease in antibody uptake. Because latrunculin did not inhibit myr-Akt-dependent GLUT4 translocation, we next determined whether latrunculin inhibited GLUT4 translocation if it was added after insulin treatment. In this experiment cells were allowed to reach a new steady state distribution of GLUT4 on the cell surface by treating with 100 nm insulin for 30 min. Latrunculin was then added to the insulin-treated cells. The cells were bathed in the presence of latrunculin and insulin for an additional 150 min (Fig. 3F). Control cells were treated with insulin for 180 min without the addition of latrunculin (Fig. 3C). As expected, 30 min of insulin treatment increased GLUT4 translocation 15-fold (Fig. 3B). Under continuous exposure of insulin for 180 min, GLUT4 translocation was increased 11-fold over basal cells (Fig. 3G). The addition of latrunculin 30 min after the addition of insulin returned GLUT4 translocation to basal conditions (Fig. 3G), consistent with a role for latrunculin in inhibition of the insulin-signaling complex. Latrunculin B Treatment Decreases Insulin-mediated PI 3-Kinase and Akt/PKB Phosphorylation on Ser-473 and Thr-308—The ability of myr-Akt to translocate GLUT4 in the absence of an actin network suggests that the actin requirement lies upstream of full Akt/PKB activation. To begin to test this, we first determined whether insulin-mediated Akt/PKB activity was affected by latrunculin treatment. Akt/PKB protein was immunoprecipitated from control and latrunculin-treated cells that were treated without or with 100 nm insulin for 30 min. The immunoprecipitates were used in an in vitro kinase assay using GSK3 fusion protein as a substrate. Treatment of cells with latrunculin B completely inhibited the insulin-dependent activation of Akt/PKB activity measured in the in vitro kinase activity (Fig. 4A). Because expression of constitutively active myr-Akt was able to stimulate GLUT4 translocation, we reasoned that latrunculin B did not inhibit the kinase activity of Akt/PKB, but rather activation of Akt/PKB itself was inhibited. To test this, we measured activation of known signaling molecules without or with insulin treatment over a time course of 0 to 30 min in the absence or presence of 10 μm latrunculin B. Whole cell lysates were generated in 3T3-L1 adipocytes treated with latrunculin B. Phosphotyrosine blotting revealed that latrunculin B treatment did not interfere with insulin-mediated phosphorylation of proteins migrating at molecular weights consistent with the β-subunit of the insulin receptor and IRS-1 (Fig. 4B). In contrast, latrunculin B treatment did inhibit the phosphotyrosine content of proteins migrating near the 120-kDa molecular mass range, which may correspond to focal adhesion kinase (39Knight J.B. Yamauchi K. Pessin J.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 10199-10203Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). Although insulin-dependent incorporation of phosphotyrosine was not affected by latrunculin treatment, we next determined whether latrunculin treatment interfered with PI 3-kinase activity that associates with the tyrosine-phosphorylated proteins. Cells were treated without or with 100 nm insulin for 30 min in the presence or absence of 10 μm latrunculin. PI 3-kinase activity was then measured in vitro from anti-phosphotyrosine immunoprecipitates. Latrunculin treatment inhibited the insulin-mediated PI 3-kinase activity by 50% compared with control cells, suggesting that efficient formation of the signaling complex was impaired in the absence of the actin network (Fig. 4C). To determine a potential mechanism for decreased Akt/PKB activity, we labeled lysates with an antibody specific for phosphothreonine at position 308 (Thr-308) and phosphoserine at position 473 (Ser-473) (Fig. 5). Phosphorylation of Akt/PKB at Thr-308 is catalyzed by phosphoinositide-dependent kinase (PDK) 1, and phosphorylation at Ser-473 is catalyzed by an enzymatic activity referred to as PDK2 (40Alessi D.R.

Rnd1, a member of this family, has a low intrinsic GTPase activity and exerts antagonistic effects on RhoA signaling. However, how the activity of Rnd1 is regulated has not yet been elucidated. Here we have demonstrated that Rnd1 directly associates with FRS2α and FRS2β, which are docking proteins of fibroblast growth factor (FGF) receptors and play important roles in the intracellular signals induced by FGFs. The interaction of FRS2β with Rnd1 suppresses the inhibitory effect of Rnd1 on RhoA. Rnd1 binds to the COOH-terminal region of FRS2β including tyrosine residues essential for the interaction with Shp2. When FGF receptor 1 is activated, it phosphorylates FRS2β, recruits Shp2, and releases Rnd1 from FRS2β. The liberated Rnd1 then inhibits RhoA activity. Furthermore, knockdown of Rnd1 by Rnd1-specific short interfering RNAs suppress the FGF-induced neurite outgrowth in PC12 cells. These results suggest that the activity of Rnd1 is regulated by FGF receptor through FRS2β and that Rnd1 plays an important role in the FGF signaling during neurite outgrowth.

The actin cytoskeleton mediates a variety of essential cellular functions, including motility, cytokinesis, and morphogenesis. Much progress has been made in elucidating the molecular mechanisms that control the organization of the actin cytoskeleton, and it is already well known that members of the Rho family of small GTPases are key regulators of the actin cytoskeleton in various cell types (1Etienne-Manneville S. Hall A. Nature. 2002; 420: 629-635Crossref PubMed Scopus (3875) Google Scholar). Like other GTPases of the Ras superfamily, they serve as molecular switches by cycling between an inactive GDP-bound state and an active GTP-bound state, and once activated, they can interact with their specific effectors, leading to a variety of biological functions. Activation of the Rho family proteins requires GDP-GTP exchange catalyzed by various guanine nucleotide exchange factors, whereas the activation of the GTPases is down-regulated by GTPase-activating proteins, which stimulate the intrinsic GTPase activities. Presently, at least 20 mammalian Rho family proteins have been identified, Rho (A, B, and C), Rac (1, 2, and 3), Cdc42, TC10, TCL, Wrch1, Chp/Wrch2, RhoG, RhoD, Rif, RhoH/TTF, RhoBTB (1 and 2), and Rnd (1, 2, and 3). Among them, the functions of Rho, Rac, and Cdc42 have been extensively characterized. In neuronal cells, activation of Rac and Cdc42 induces the formation of lamellipodia and filopodia of the growth cone and stimulation of neurite outgrowth. On the other hand, Rho activation induces the inhibition of neuritogenesis and neurite retraction. Recent studies have revealed involvement of Rho family GTPases in the downstream signaling pathways of a variety of neurotrophins and axon guidance molecules to regulate the actin cytoskeleton (2Negishi M. Katoh H. J. Biochem. 2002; 132: 157-166Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar). Fibroblast growth factors (FGF(s)) 1The abbreviations used are: FGF, fibroblast growth factor; FGFR, fibroblast growth factor receptor; HA, hemagglutinin; GST, glutathione S-transferase; GFP, green fluorescent protein; aFGF, acidic FGF; siRNA, short interfering RNA; WT, wild type; GTPγS, guanosine 5′-3-O-(thio)triphosphate; SH, Src homology. constitute a large family of growth factors that influence a wide variety of biological processes such as angiogenesis, embryogenesis, differentiation, and proliferation depending on the cell type (3Basilico C.

In the nervous system, they have been shown to stimulate both the differentiation and survival of postmitotic cells as well as being proliferative factors for non-differentiated cells (5Gritti A.

FGFs mediate their pleiotropic responses by binding to and activating a family of receptor tyrosine kinases designated FGF receptors (FGFRs) 1-4 (6Schlessinger J.

Many of the cellular responses of FGFRs are mediated by the membrane-linked docking proteins, FRS2α and FRS2β (7Gotoh N. Laks S. Nakashima M. Lax I. Schlessinger J.

Concerning signaling to Rho family GTPases, recent studies indicate that basic FGF induces phosphorylation of the p85 βPIX, a guanine nucleotide exchange factor for Rac1/Cdc42 and that phosphorylated p85 βPIX mediates Rac1 activation and regulates cytoskeletal reorganization at growth cones (12Shin E.Y.

The Rnd proteins, Rnd1, Rnd2, and Rnd3/RhoE, comprise a unique branch of Rho family GTPases that lack intrinsic GTPase activity and consequently remain constitutively active (14Nobes C.D. Lauritzen I. Mattei M.G. Paris S. Hall A. Chardin P. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 141: 187-197Crossref PubMed Scopus (309) Google Scholar, 15Guasch R.M. Scambler P. Jones G.E. Ridley A.J. Mol. Cell.

Prior studies have suggested that Rnd1 has antagonistic effects on RhoA-regulated signaling pathways, and several downstream effectors have been identified, such as Socius and p190RhoGAP (14Nobes C.D.

Here we show that Rnd1 directly interacts with FRS2α and FRS2β. The Rnd1-induced inactivation of RhoA is regulated by the FGF receptor through FRS2β, and Rnd1 is involved in the FGF-induced neurite outgrowth. We propose a new role of Rnd1 in the FGF signaling pathway leading to RhoA inactivation and cytoskeletal rearrangements. Plasmid Constructions and Antibodies—The coding sequences for rat FRS2α, FRS2β, and FGFR1 were obtained from rat pheochromocytoma PC12 cells by reverse transcription-PCR. The PCR products were cloned into pCR2.1 vector (Invitrogen) and sequenced completely. For expression in mammalian cells, the cDNAs for wild-type FRS2α and FRS2β were subcloned into pcDNA3 (Invitrogen) encoding the Myc tag sequence at the COOH terminus followed by a stop codon. The cDNA for wild-type FGFR1 was subcloned into pcDNA3. FRS2βY418F/Y456F, FRS2βY418F, FRS2βY456F, and FGFR1Y653F/Y654F were generated by PCR-mediated mutagenesis (19Ito W. Ishiguro H. Kurosawa Y. Gene (Amst.). 1991; 102: 67-70Crossref PubMed Scopus (261) Google Scholar). Hemagglutinin A (HA)-tagged Rnd1, Rnd2, Rnd3, RhoAV16, Rac1V12, Cdc42V12, and green fluorescent protein (GFP)-tagged Rnd1 were obtained as described previously (17Katoh H. Harada A. Mori K. Negishi M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2002; 22: 2952-2964Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). For purification of recombinant proteins, cDNAs of Rnd1, Rac1, FRS2α-WT (amino acids 2-508), FRS2α-CT (amino acids 411-508), FRS2β-WT (amino acids 2-493), FRS2β-CT* (amino acids 247-493), FRS2β-CT (amino acids 393-493), and FRS2β-ΔCT (amino acids 2-392) were subcloned into pGEX4T-2 (Amersham Biosciences). The short interfering RNAs (siRNAs) for rat Rnd1 were designed to target 19 nucleotides of the rat Rnd1 transcript (Rnd1 siRNA-A, nucleotide 74-92, 5′-ggaagacggcgatgttaca-3′; Rnd1 siRNA-B, nucleotide 145-163, 5′-ttacacagcctgtttggag-3′; Rnd1 siRNA-C, nucleotide 396-414, 5′-cctgagcactctaatggaa-3′), and they were expressed by using a siRNA expression vector pSilencer (Ambion). We used a pSilencer plasmid encoding a hairpin siRNA whose sequence is not found in the mouse, human, or rat genome data bases supplied with the kit as a control. Antibodies used were as follows: a mouse monoclonal anti-Myc antibody 9E10 and a mouse monoclonal phosphotyrosine antibody (Upstate Biotechnology, Inc., Lake Placid, NY); a rabbit polyclonal anti-Myc antibody (MBL); a mouse monoclonal anti-HA antibody 12CA5 (Roche Applied Science); a mouse monoclonal anti-Rac1 antibody (BD Biosciences); a mouse monoclonal anti-α-tubulin antibody (Sigma); a mouse monoclonal anti-GFP antibody, a mouse monoclonal anti-RhoA antibody, a rabbit polyclonal anti-FGFR1 antibody, and anti-Shp2 antibody (Santa Cruz Biotechnology); and horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibodies (DAKO). A rabbit polyclonal antibody against Rnd1 has been described previously (20Ishikawa Y. Katoh H. Negishi M. J. Neurosci. 2003; 23: 11065-11072Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Yeast Two-hybrid Screening—A rat brain cDNA library fused to the GAL4 activation domain of the pACT2 vector (Clontech) was screened using pGBKT7/Rnd1S229 as bait in the yeast strain AH109 according to the manufacturer's instructions. Interaction between the bait and library proteins activates transcription of the reporter genes HIS3, Ade, and lacZ. From 1.3 × 107 transformants, 647 colonies grew on selective medium lacking histidine and adenine and were also positive for β-galactosidase activity. One of these, clone 2-107 was found to encode the carboxyl-terminal 247 amino acids of FRS2β. For the β-galactosidase filter assay, colonies of yeast transformants were transferred onto Hybond-N filter papers (Amersham Biosciences) and permeabilized in liquid nitrogen. Each filter was placed on a What-man No. 2 filter paper that had been presoaked in Z buffer (60 mm Na2HPO4, 40 mm NaH2PO4, 10 mm KCl, 1 mm MgSO4, and 37.5 mm β-mercaptoethanol) containing 0.33 mg/ml 5-bromo-4-chloro-3-indolyl-β-d-galactopyranoside and was incubated at 30 °C for 8 h. Cell Culture and Transfection—293T cells were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 10% fetal bovine serum, 4 mm glutamine, 100 units/ml penicillin, and 0.2 mg/ml streptomycin under humidified conditions in 95% air and 5% CO2 at 37 °C. PC12 cells were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 10% horse serum and 5% fetal bovine serum. Transient transfections were carried out with Lipofectamine PLUS (Invitrogen) for 293T cells or Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen) for PC12 cells, according to the manufacturer's instructions. Immunoblotting—Proteins were separated by 10 or 12.5% SDS-PAGE and were electrophoretically transferred onto a polyvinylidene difluoride membrane (Millipore Corp.). The membrane was blocked with 3% low fat milk in Tris-buffered saline (10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl) and then incubated with primary antibodies. The primary antibodies were detected with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibodies and the ECL detection kit (Amersham Biosciences). In Vitro Binding Assays—All glutathione S-transferase (GST)-fused proteins were purified from Escherichia coli as described previously (17Katoh H. Harada A. Mori K. Negishi M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2002; 22: 2952-2964Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). Protein concentration was determined by comparing with bovine serum albumin standards after SDS-PAGE and by staining with Coomassie Brilliant Blue. For pull-down assays, 293T cells transfected with HA-tagged Rho GTPases were rinsed once with phosphate-buffered saline and lysed with the ice-cold cell lysis buffer (20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 2 mm MgCl2, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 0.2% Triton X-100, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 10 μg/ml aprotinin, and 10 μg/ml leupeptin). Cell lysates were then centrifuged for 10 min at 16,000 × g at 4 °C. The supernatants were incubated for 10 min at 4 °C with 10 μg of GST fusion proteins and subsequently incubated with glutathione-Sepharose beads for 2 h at 4 °C. After the beads were washed with the ice-cold cell lysis buffer, the bound proteins were eluted in Laemmli sample buffer and analyzed by SDS-PAGE and immunoblotting with anti-HA antibody. To examine direct interaction between the FRS2β and Rnd1, dot blot assay was performed as described previously (21Kakimoto T. Katoh H. Negishi M. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 14104-14110Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). Five μg of GST and GST-fused FRS2β (amino acids 247-493) were spotted onto a nitrocellulose membrane and allowed to dry for 1 h at room temperature. The membrane was blocked with buffer A (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, 10 mm MgCl2, and 1 mm dithiothreitol) containing 5% low fat milk for 1 h at 4 °C. The membrane was then incubated for 1 h at 4 °C in buffer A containing 20 μg of GST-fused Rnd1 or Rac1 preloaded with GTPγS. The membrane was washed with buffer A and then incubated with 3% low fat milk in Tris-buffered saline containing anti-Rnd1 or anti-Rac1 antibody. These antibodies were detected by using horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibody and the ECL detection kit. Immunoprecipitation—293T cells cotransfected with Myc-tagged FRS2α or FRS2β and HA-tagged Rnd1 together with or without FGFR1 were lysed with ice-cold cell lysis buffer (20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 2 mm MgCl2, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 1% Nonidet P-40, 0.25% sodium deoxycholate, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 10 μg/ml aprotinin, 10 μg/ml leupeptin, 25 mm NaF, and 1 mm Na3VO4). After centrifugation, the supernatants were incubated with anti-Myc polyclonal antibody for 1 h and then with protein A-Sepharose (Amersham Biosciences) for 1 h. The beads were washed with the lysis buffer, and bound proteins were analyzed by SDS-PAGE and immunoblotting. Immunofluorescence Microscopy—PC12 cells were seeded onto round 13-mm glass coverslips coated with poly-d-lysine, and then they were transfected with expression vectors encoding GFP and HA-RhoAV14. At 5 h after transfection, the medium was changed with Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 100 ng/ml acidic FGF (aFGF) (Sigma) and 5 μg/ml heparin. At 48 h after treating with aFGF, cells on coverslips were fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde in phosphate-buffered saline for 15 min. Cells on coverslips were mounted in 90% glycerol containing 0.1% p-phenylenediamine dihydrochloride in phosphate-buffered saline. Alternatively, PC12 cells were transiently transfected with expression vectors encoding GFP and Rnd1-specific siRNA or GFP and Myc-tagged FRS2β. At 48 h after transfection, they were stimulated with 100 ng/ml aFGF and 5 μg/ml heparin. PC12 cells possessing one or more neurites longer than the diameter of the cell body were scored as positive. We scored more than 50 cells in each experiment. Measurement of RhoA Activity—Measurement of RhoA activity was performed as described previously (22Oinuma I. Katoh H. Harada A. Negishi M. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 25671-25677Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). Briefly, 293T cells were transfected with an expression vector encoding HA-tagged wild-type RhoA together with Myc-tagged FRS2β and GFP-tagged Rnd1. At 36 h after transfection, the cells were washed with ice-cold Tris-buffered saline, and lysed with the cell lysis buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, 30 mm MgCl2, 0.5% Triton X-100, 0.5% sodium deoxycholate, 10% glycerol, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 10 μg/ml aprotinin, and 10 μg/ml leupeptin) containing 20 μg of GST-fused Rho-binding domain of mouse Rhotekin. The cell lysates were centrifuged for 5 min at 16,000 × g at 4 °C, and the supernatants were incubated with glutathione-Sepharose beads for 1 h at 4 °C. The beads were washed with the lysis buffer, and bound proteins were analyzed by SDS-PAGE and immunoblotting. Rnd1 Directly Interacts with FRS2α and FRS2β—In an attempt to identify binding proteins of Rnd1, we employed a two-hybrid screening of a rat brain cDNA library with Rnd1S229, a mutant of Rnd1 lacking the carboxyl-terminal CAAX motif, as bait. Approximately 1.3 × 107 clones were screened, and several positive clones were isolated. Sequence analyses revealed that one of them encoded the COOH-terminal region of rat FRS2β. FRS2α and FRS2β function as mediators of signaling by FGFRs (7Gotoh N. Laks S. Nakashima M. Lax I. Schlessinger J. FEBS Lett. 2004; 564: 14-18Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar, 8Kouhara H.

To determine whether Rnd1 interacts with FRS2α and FRS2β in vitro, HA-tagged Rnd1 was expressed in 293T cells and pull-down assays were performed by using the purified GST-fused full-length of FRS2α and FRS2β. As shown in Fig. 1A, GST-FRS2α and FRS2β interacted with Rnd1. Rnd2 also interacted with FRS2α and FRS2β, but Rnd3 and constitutively active RhoA (RhoAV14), Rac1 (Rac1V12), and Cdc42 (Cdc42V12) did not, indicating that FRS2 proteins specifically interact with Rnd1 and Rnd2. A dot blot assay with GTPγS-loaded purified GST-Rnd1 as a probe showed that the GTP-bound Rnd1 directly interacted with FRS2β (Fig. 1B). To determine whether Rnd1 interacts with FRS2α and FRS2β in mammalian cells, lysates from 293T cells expressing HA-tagged Rnd1 and either Myc-tagged full-length FRS2α or FRS2β were used in a coimmunoprecipitation assay. Rnd1 was coimmunoprecipitated with FRS2α and FRS2β, but RhoAV14 and Cdc42V12 were not (Fig. 1C), indicating that Rnd1 interacts with FRS2α and FRS2β in mammalian cells. To determine the region of FRS2α and FRS2β required for the interaction with Rnd1, various truncated forms of FRS2α and FRS2β were purified as GST fusion proteins, and their bindings to HA-tagged Rnd1 expressed in 293T cells were examined by a pull-down assay (Fig. 2). HA-tagged Rnd1 was precipitated by the GST-fused COOH-terminal region of FRS2α (FRS2α-CT, amino acids 411-508) or FRS2β (FRS2β-CT, amino acids 393-493) and the wild-type proteins (FRS2α-WT and FRS2β-WT) or the fragment corresponding to the original yeast clone (FRS2β-CT*, amino acids 247-493), whereas it was not precipitated by the GST-fused FRS2β lacking CT region (FRS2β-ΔCT, amino acids 2-392) or GST alone (Fig. 2, B and C). These results indicate that the binding site of Rnd1 is located at the COOH-terminal region of FRS2α and FRS2β. Tyrosine Phosphorylation of FRS2β Releases Rnd1 from FRS2β and Recruits Shp2—Upon FGF stimulation, FRS2α and FRS2β are phosphorylated by activated FGFRs and recruit Grb2 and Shp2. FRS2β-CT contains two tyrosine phosphorylation sites, Tyr-418 and Tyr-456, and their phosphorylations are essential for the interaction with Shp2 (9Hadari Y.R. Kouhara H. Lax I. Schlessinger J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 3966-3973Crossref PubMed Scopus (276) Google Scholar, 11Xu H. Goldfarb M. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 20: 13049-13056Google Scholar). Therefore, we next examined whether phosphorylation of FRS2 affects its interaction with Rnd1. 293T cells were cotransfected with Myc-tagged FRS2β, HA-tagged Rnd1, and FGFR1, and the lysates were then immunoprecipitated with anti-Myc antibody. FRS2β was tyrosine phosphorylated when it was coexpressed with FGFR1 and bound to Shp2. In contrast, Rnd1 was dissociated from the phosphorylated FRS2β (Fig. 3A). The dissociation of Rnd1 from FRS2β was not observed when they were coexpressed with kinase-inactive FGFR1 (FGFR1-KD). We found that FRS2α also had Rnd1-releasing activity, although it was weak compared with that of FRS2β (data not shown). We generated FRS2β containing Y418F and Y456F substitutions in the Shp2-binding region (FRS2β-2F) to examine whether tyrosine phosphorylation in this region is required for the dissociation of Rnd1 from FRS2β. As observed in previous studies (9Hadari Y.R. Kouhara H. Lax I. Schlessinger J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 3966-3973Crossref PubMed Scopus (276) Google Scholar, 11Xu H. Goldfarb M. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 20: 13049-13056Google Scholar), FRS2β-2F was phosphorylated by FGFR1, probably at tyrosine residues in the Grb2-binding region. However, FRS2β-2F did not interact with Shp2 in the presence of FGFR1. On the other hand, Rnd1 interacted with FRS2β-2F in the absence and presence of FGFR1 (Fig. 3A). We further examined whether one or both phosphorylation sites of FRS2β are essential for the loss of Rnd1 binding by using each of single point mutants of FRS2β (FRS2β-Phe-418 and FRS2β-Phe-456). Both FRS2β-Phe-418 and FRS2β-Phe-456 interacted with Rnd1 in the absence of FGFR1 and partially released Rnd1 in the presence of FGFR1 (Fig. 3B). Taken together, these results suggest that the interaction of Rnd1 with FRS2β is regulated by the FGFR-induced phosphorylation of FRS2β and that both Tyr-418 and Tyr-456 are important for the regulation of Rnd1 binding. The Activity of Rnd1 Is Regulated by Its Interaction with FRS2β—Rnd1 has much lower affinity to GDP than GTP and no detectable intrinsic GTPase activity (14Nobes C.D. Lauritzen I. Mattei M.G. Paris S. Hall A. Chardin P. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 141: 187-197Crossref PubMed Scopus (309) Google Scholar), and no GTPase-activating protein or inhibitory binding protein specific for Rnd1 has been identified so far. Thus, it remains unknown how the cellular activities of Rnd1 are regulated. We next examined the possibility that FRS2β functions as an inhibitory binding protein for Rnd1 and that the activity of Rnd1 is regulated by FGFR-induced phosphorylation of FRS2β. Several lines of evidence indicate that Rnd1 counteracts the biological functions of RhoA (14Nobes C.D. Lauritzen I. Mattei M.G. Paris S. Hall A. Chardin P. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 141: 187-197Crossref PubMed Scopus (309) Google Scholar, 16Wunnenberg-Stapleton K. Blitz I.L. Hashimoto C. Cho K.W.

Biol. 2003; 13: 1106-1115Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (189) Google Scholar). Therefore, we measured the level of active GTP-bound RhoA in cells by using GST-fused Rho-binding domain of Rhotekin to precipitate GTP-bound RhoA from the cell lysates (23Ren X.D. Schwartz M.A. Methods Enzymol. 2000; 256: 215-227Google Scholar). HA-tagged wild-type RhoA was cotransfected with GFP-tagged Rnd1 in the absence and presence of Myc-tagged FRS2β and FGFR1 in 293T cells, and precipitated GTP-bound RhoA was detected with anti-HA antibody. Expression of Rnd1 dramatically decreased RhoA activity in the cells. However, the down-regulation of RhoA activity by Rnd1 was significantly attenuated in the cells coexpressing Rnd1 and FRS2β (Fig. 4). On the other hand, expression of FGFR1 restored the Rnd1-induced inactivation of RhoA, whereas the expression of FGFR1-KD did not. Furthermore, coexpression of Rnd1 with FRS2β-2F suppressed the Rnd1-induced down-regulation of RhoA activity in the absence and presence of FGFR1. These results indicate that the Rnd1-induced down-regulation of RhoA activity is regulated by the interaction of Rnd1 with FRS2β. Knock-down of Rnd1 Suppresses the FGF-induced Neurite Outgrowth in PC12 Cells—FGFs play important roles in neurogenesis, axon growth, and differentiation (24Reuss B. von Bohlen und Halbach O. Cell Tissue Res. 2003; 313: 139-157Crossref PubMed Scopus (343) Google Scholar), and previous reports showed that FGFs stimulate neurite extension in PC12 cells (8Kouhara H. Hadari Y.R. Spivak-Kroizman T. Schilling J. Bar-Sagi D. Lax I. Schlessinger J. Cell. 1997; 89: 693-702Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (730) Google Scholar, 25Togari A. Dickens G. Kozuya H. Guroff G. J. Neurosci. 1985; 5: 307-316Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Rho family GTPases regulate neuronal morphology through reorganizing the actin cytoskeleton (2Negishi M. Katoh H. J. Biochem. 2002; 132: 157-166Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar, 26Da Silva J.S. Dotti C.G. Nat. Rev. Neurosci. 2002; 3: 694-704Crossref PubMed Scopus (366) Google Scholar, 27Luo L. Nat. Rev. Neurosci. 2000; 1: 173-180Crossref PubMed Scopus (838) Google Scholar). Among them, activation of RhoA has been known to stabilize cortical actin and prevents neurite outgrowth, whereas inactivation of RhoA promotes neurite outgrowth in PC12 cells (2Negishi M. Katoh H. J. Biochem. 2002; 132: 157-166Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar, 26Da Silva J.S. Dotti C.G. Nat. Rev. Neurosci. 2002; 3: 694-704Crossref PubMed Scopus (366) Google Scholar). In addition, ectopic expression of Rnd1 in PC12 cells stimulates neurite extension (28Aoki J. Katoh H. Mori K. Negishi M. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2000; 278: 604-608Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). These observations led us to examine whether Rnd1 is involved in the FGF-induced neurite outgrowth in PC12 cells by inhibiting RhoA activity. Indeed, stimulation of PC12 cells with aFGF decreased GTP-bound RhoA in the cells (Fig. 5A). To determine whether the down-regulation of RhoA activity is required for the FGF-induced neurite outgrowth, we transfected HA-tagged RhoAV14 and examined cell morphology after stimulation of the cells with aFGF. PC12 cells expressing GFP alone extend their neurites after stimulation with aFGF. In contrast, expression of HA-tagged RhoAV14 completely blocked the aFGF-induced neurite extension (Fig. 5B). We next examined the involvement of Rnd1 in the FGF-induced neurite extension by expressing vectors encoding Rnd1-specific siRNAs. Three siRNAs targeting different coding regions of the rat Rnd1 cDNA were designed (Rnd1 siRNA-A, -B, and -C), and two of them (Rnd1 siRNA-A and -B) significantly reduced exogenously expressed Myc-tagged rat Rnd1 (Fig. 5C). However, they had no effect on the Rnd2 expression (data not shown). Similar to untransfected cells, PC12 cells coexpressing GFP and control siRNA or Rnd1 siRNA-C that had little effect on Rnd1 expression caused neurite outgrowth in response to aFGF. However, coexpression of GFP and Rnd1 siRNA-A or -B significantly blocked the aFGF-induced neurite outgrowth (Fig. 5D). We also examined whether expression of FRS2β-2F has the same effect as the Rnd1 siRNA in decreasing neurite outgrowth in PC12 cells, because Rnd1 was not dissociated from FRS2β-2F (Fig. 3A). However, we could not detect PC12 cells expressing the FRS2β-2F mutant, although wild-type FRS2β was expressed in the same transfection condition. This may be because overexpression of FRS2β-2F mutant was toxic to PC12 cells (data not shown). These results indicate that Rnd1 is involved in the FGF-induced neurite outgrowth in PC12 cells. Most of Rho family GTPases cycle between inactive GDP-bound and active GTP-bound forms. However, Rnd1 has been shown to be constitutively active, because it has substitutions at amino acid residues known to be important for GTP hydrolysis (14Nobes C.D. Lauritzen I. Mattei M.G. Paris S. Hall A. Chardin P. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 141: 187-197Crossref PubMed Scopus (309) Google Scholar). Although several downstream proteins that interact with Rnd1 have been identified, it has not yet to be elucidated how its function is regulated. Our findings demonstrate an FRS2β phosphorylation-dependent mechanism for regulating Rnd1 function. We showed that FRS2β directly associates with Rnd1 and suppresses the activity of Rnd1. The binding region of Rnd1 is located at the COOH-terminal region of FRS2β including Tyr-418 and Tyr-456, which are essential for the interaction with the SH2 domain of Shp2. Phosphorylation of FRS2β by FGFR1 at Tyr-418 and Tyr-456 recruits Shp2 and instead releases Rnd1 from FRS2β, and then dissociated Rnd1 inhibits RhoA. These results suggest that the activity of Rnd1 is regulated by FGFR through FRS2β. A previous report showed that expression of Rnd3, another Rnd subfamily member that is also known to be a constitutively active GTPase, can be induced by expressing activated Raf in Madin-Darby canine kidney cells, but the expression of Rnd1 is not affected (29Hansen S.H. Zegers M.M. Woodrow M. Rodriguez-Viciana P. Chardin P. Mostov K.E. McMahon M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 9364-9375Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). Similarly, stimulation of fibroblasts with platelet-derived growth factor promotes the synthesis of Rnd3 protein (30Riento K. Guasch R.M. Garg R. Jin B. Ridley A.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2003; 23: 4219-4229Crossref PubMed Scopus (245) Google Scholar). Our results showed that Rnd3 does not interact with FRS2α and FRS2β. In this respect, these constitutively active GTPases may be differently regulated; the activity of Rnd1 is controlled by the interaction with inhibitory binding proteins such as FRS2β, whereas Rnd3 is regulated at the level of transcription or translation. Rho family GTPases are critical regulators of neurite outgrowth (2Negishi M. Katoh H. J. Biochem. 2002; 132: 157-166Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar, 26Da Silva J.S. Dotti C.G. Nat. Rev. Neurosci. 2002; 3: 694-704Crossref PubMed Scopus (366) Google Scholar, 27Luo L. Nat. Rev. Neurosci. 2000; 1: 173-180Crossref PubMed Scopus (838) Google Scholar). Among them, Rac and Cdc42 activation are involved in promoting neurite outgrowth, whereas RhoA inhibits the outgrowth, and down-regulation of RhoA activity is required for the neurite outgrowth (2Negishi M. Katoh H. J. Biochem. 2002; 132: 157-166Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar, 26Da Silva J.S. Dotti C.G. Nat. Rev.

It seems likely that Rho GTPases are also involved in FGF-induced neurite outgrowth. Indeed, a recent study showed that basic FGF induces Rac1 activation through p85 βPIX, which in turn regulates cytoskeletal reorganization at growth cones (12Shin E.Y. Shin K.S. Lee C.S. Woo K.N. Quan S.H. Soung N.K. Kim Y.G. Cha C.I. Kim S.R. Park D. Bokoch G.M. Kim E.G. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 44417-44430Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar, 13Shin E.Y.

We show here that FGFR-induced phosphorylation of FRS2β triggers the Rnd1-induced down-regulation of RhoA activity. The down-regulation of endogenous RhoA activity was observed in PC12 cells when they were stimulated with FGF. In addition, overexpression of constitutively active RhoA, or knock-down of endogenous Rnd1 by Rnd1-specific siRNA inhibited FGF-induced neurite outgrowth in PC12 cells. These observations suggest that down-regulation of RhoA is one of important signaling pathways in FGF-induced neurite outgrowth, and that Rnd1 is involved in this effect. It has been reported that FGF-2 (basic FGF) increases functional excitatory synapses on cultured hippocampal neurons (31Li A.J. Suzuki S. Suzuki M. Mizukoshi E. Imamura T. Eur. J. Neurosci. 2002; 16: 1313-1324Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). Recently, we have shown that Rnd1 is highly expressed in hippocampus during the stage of synapse formation and plays a role in spine formation (20Ishikawa Y. Katoh H. Negishi M. J. Neurosci. 2003; 23: 11065-11072Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In contrast, active Rho has been shown to strongly induce a loss of mature-shaped spines, whereas inhibition of RhoA activity resulted in elongated spine necks (32Nakayama A.Y. Harms M.B. Luo L. J. Neurosci. 2000; 20: 5329-5338Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 33Tashiro A. Minden A. Yuste R. Cereb. Cortex. 2000; 10: 927-938Crossref PubMed Scopus (351) Google Scholar). Considering our present results and these observations, FGFs may enhance synapse formation by Rnd1-induced inactivation of RhoA. In conclusion, we identified FRS2β as an upstream regulator of Rnd1 and demonstrated that Rnd1 plays an important role for FGF-induced neurite outgrowth in PC12 cells. This study not only links FRS2β to Rnd1 but also contributes to the understanding of control mechanism for constitutively active GTPases."

Therefore, an understanding of the regulation of fibrinogen expression is important. Inflammation and genetic variation of the fibrinogen β gene regulate plasma fibrinogen levels, and there are indications that inflammation and genetic variation interact. The aim of our study was to gain more understanding of the regulation of the inflammatory response of the fibrinogen β gene and to determine the effects of genetic variation. Luciferase reporter gene assays in hepatoma cells, mutation analysis, and electrophoretic mobility shift assays were used to investigate the transcriptional regulation of the fibrinogen β promoter. We identified a hepatocyte nuclear factor-3 (HNF-3) site located just upstream of previously identified interleukin-6 (IL6)-responsive sequences. This HNF-3 site is essential for a full response of the promoter to IL6, which is a new function for HNF-3. The activity of the CCAAT box/enhancer-binding protein site (located 18 nucleotides downstream of the HNF-3 site and important to the IL6 response) depends on the integrity of the HNF-3 site and vice versa, explaining the necessity of HNF-3 in the IL6 response of the fibrinogen β promoter. Furthermore, small interfering RNA to HNF-3 reduces the fibrinogen β mRNA levels. The rare T allele of the –148C/T polymorphism, which is present between the binding sites of HNF-3 and CCAAT box/enhancer-binding protein, interferes with this mechanism, and this polymorphism is in our assay system the only genetic determinant of IL6-induced promoter activity among six polymorphisms in the fibrinogen β promoter.

The rare T allele of the –148C/T polymorphism, which is present between the binding sites of HNF-3 and CCAAT box/enhancer-binding protein, interferes with this mechanism, and this polymorphism is in our assay system the only genetic determinant of IL6-induced promoter activity among six polymorphisms in the fibrinogen β promoter. Inflammation is an important process in the development of cardiovascular disease, and increased plasma levels of inflammatory factors such as fibrinogen are consistently associated with an increased risk of cardiovascular disease (1Meade T.W. Mellows S. Brozovic M. Miller G.J. Chakrabarti R.R. North W.R.S. Haines A.P. Stirling Y. Imeson J.D. Thompson S.G. Lancet. 1986; 2: 533-537Abstract PubMed Scopus (1906) Google Scholar, 2Yarnell J.W.

On the one hand their plasma levels reflect the severity of inflammatory processes in the vessel wall, and on the other hand they can contribute directly to the development of the disease. Fibrinogen is present in the atherosclerotic plaque where it can contribute to the progression of atherosclerosis, for example by increasing the chemotaxis of smooth muscle cells and affecting the stability and structure of the plaque (5Naito M.

Because of the relationship of fibrinogen with atherosclerosis, much attention has been paid to the regulation of fibrinogen levels under both basal and inflammatory conditions. The mature fibrinogen molecule is composed of three pairs of polypeptide chains: two α chains, two β chains, and two γ chains; and in vitro functional studies showed that synthesis of the β chain is rate-limiting (9Roy S.N. Mukhopadhyay G. Redman C.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 6389-6393Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Fibrinogen is expressed by the liver. Fibrinogen levels can strongly increase in response to intense acute phase stimuli such as trauma, surgery, or strenuous exercise, and fibrinogen levels are chronically elevated in the presence of mild (inflammatory) stimuli such as smoking or severe atherosclerosis (10Schuit A.J.

Interleukin-6 (IL6) 1The abbreviations used are: IL, interleukin; HNF, hepatocyte nuclear factor; C/EBP, CCAAT box/enhancer-binding protein; IL6 RE, IL6-responsive element; DMEM, Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium; HSA, human serum albumin; EMSA, electrophoretic mobility shift assay; siRNA, small interfering RNA; Fib, fibrinogen. is the main mediator of acute phase-induced fibrinogen synthesis, and sequences responsive to IL6 are present in the promoter regions of the genes coding for the three fibrinogen chains. In the promoter region of the fibrinogen β gene, several DNA sequences that are required for full IL6-induced expression have been identified as follows: an hepatocyte nuclear factor-1 (HNF-1) site at ∼85 nucleotides upstream of the transcription start site; a CCAAT box/enhancer-binding protein (C/EBP)-binding site; and an IL6-responsive element (IL6 RE) (13Anderson G.M.

The C/EBP-binding site and the IL6 RE are located adjacent to each other at ∼125 nucleotides upstream from the transcription start site. C/EBPβ (also named LAP (liver-enriched activating protein) or NF-IL6 (nuclear factor for interleukin-6 expression)) has been identified as a transcription factor important in mediating the IL6 response of many liver acute phase genes, and binding of C/EBPβ to the fibrinogen β promoter has been demonstrated (14Dalmon J. Laurent M. Courtois G. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 1183-1193Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 16Poli V. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 29279-29282Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (557) Google Scholar). The IL6 RE is located 4 bp upstream of the C/EBPβ site, and it has been shown repeatedly that sequence changes in this element result in loss of response of the gene to IL6 (13Anderson G.M. Shaw A.R. Shafer J.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 22650-22655Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 14Dalmon J. Laurent M. Courtois G. Mol. Cell.

However, no transcription factor binding to this IL6 RE has been identified yet, leaving the regulation of the hepatic IL6-induced fibrinogen β expression partly unexplained. The relationship between genetic variation of the fibrinogen β chain and plasma fibrinogen levels has been studied on many occasions. The A allele of the fibrinogen β –455G/A variation has been associated consistently with elevated habitual fibrinogen levels, and an interaction between the –455G/A polymorphism and acute phase stimuli has been reported as well (17Humphries S.E.

It has been demonstrated that subjects with at least one A allele respond to trauma, surgery, or strenuous exercise with a stronger rise in fibrinogen levels than –455GG homozygotes, and in most of these reports a critical role is attributed to the inflammatory mediator IL6 (24Montgomery H.E.

Haemostasis. 2002; 87: 37-41Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). Besides the –455G/A polymorphism, there are several other polymorphisms in the promoter of the fibrinogen β gene. The –1420G/A, –993C/T, and –148C/T variations are in complete linkage disequilibrium with –455G/A in Caucasians, and any of these variations therefore could influence fibrinogen levels (28Baumann R.E. Henschen A.H. Hum. Genet. 1994; 94: 165-170Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar, 29Thomas A. Lamlum H. Humphries S. Green F. Hum. Mutat. 1994; 3: 79-81Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar). Knowing the functional variation(s) is important from an epidemiological point of view, as these polymorphisms are not always coinherited in other ethnic groups (30Cook D.G. Cappuccio F.P. Atkinson R.W. Wicks P.D. Chitolie A. Nakandakare E.R. Sagnella G.A. Humphries S.E. Am. J. Epidemiol. 2001; 153: 799-806Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). Furthermore, identification of the functional variations and understanding of the mechanism are essential for insight into the causes of the interindividual variation in the inflammatory response. The aim of our study was to gain more understanding of the acute phase response of fibrinogen and to determine the influence of genetic variation on these mechanisms. We identified a novel HNF-3 site located just upstream of the IL6 RE and C/EBP site. We demonstrate requirement of this HNF-3 site for full IL6 response of the fibrinogen β promoter, which can be explained by an interaction between the HNF-3 site and the IL6-responsive C/EBP site. In addition, we show interference of the adjacent –148C/T polymorphism with this mechanism, explaining its effect on IL6-induced fibrinogen β promoter activity. Finally, we establish that, among six common polymorphisms present in the fibrinogen β promoter, it is only the –148C/T variation that is functional in our study. Cell Lines—The human hepatoma cell lines HepG2 (American Type Culture Collection) and HuH7 (31Nakabayashi H. Taketa K. Miyano K. Yamane T. Sato J. Cancer Res. 1982; 42: 3858-3863PubMed Google Scholar) were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (DMEM, Invitrogen) supplemented with 100 units/ml penicillin, 100 μg/ml streptomycin (BioWhittaker Europe), and 10% fetal bovine serum (Invitrogen). pGL3-Fibrinogen β Promoter-Reporter Gene Constructs—Approximately 1800 bp of the promoter region of the fibrinogen β gene (–1788 to +8, taking position 1499 in GenBank™ accession number X05018 as –1) was amplified by PCR on genomic DNA. In this PCR, 10 pmol of each primer (forward primer, 5′-TCT TACGCGTGA AGA ATG CCA ATC AGA GTA-3′; reverse primer, 5′-TCA TCTCGAGTA GAC TTA ACT GAG AGA TCT TCA-3′) and 50 ng of genomic DNA was used at an annealing temperature of 72 °C. PCR products were digested with MluI and XhoI (the restriction sites introduced are underlined in the primer sequences) and cloned into pGL3-basic (Promega). Finally, four pGL3-basic constructs, each containing 1800 bp of the wild-type fibrinogen β promoter with a different common promoter haplotype, were obtained: pGL3-FGB Haplo a, pGL3-FGB Haplo b, pGL3-FGB Haplo c, and pGL3-FGB Haplo d (Table I). In addition, artificial promoter haplotypes were constructed to discriminate between the effects of the individual polymorphisms. By exchanging the BsaBI-MluI restriction fragment between pGL3-FGB Haplo b and pGL3-FGB Haplo d, two additional constructs (pGL3-FGB Haplo b′-148T and pGL3-FGB Haplo d′-148C) were derived (Table I). For creation of the HNF-3-binding site mutants, pGL3-FGB Haplo b was used as parental construct. The putative HNF-3 site at –159/–151 in the fibrinogen β promoter was mutated by site-directed mutagenesis (QuikChange® site-directed mutagenesis kit, Stratagene), exactly as described by the manufacturer, using the mutagenic primers with sequences 5′-GCA ACA TCT TCC CAG CAA AGC TGA AGT ACT TGT CAT ACA AC-3′ and 5′-GT TGT ATG ACA AGT ACT TCA GCT TTG CTG GGA AGA TGT TGC-3′. This resulted in a pGL3-basic-derived construct including 1800 bp of the human fibrinogen β promoter, with the core of the putative HNF3 site at –159/–151 changed from TATTTACTT to GAAGTACTT (pGL3-FGB Haplo b HNF3mut). The identity of the clones was verified by sequencing.Table IFibrinogen β promoter variants present in pGL3-basic constructs Open table in a new tab In addition to the constructs described above, constructs designed to study the C/EBP site at –133/–125 were also used. These constructs were already available at our institute and are described elsewhere (15Gervois P. Vu-Dac N. Kleemann R. Kockx M. Dubois G. Laine B. Kosykh V. Fruchart J.C. Kooistra T. Staels B. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 33471-33477Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar). These pGL3-basic-derived constructs include 400 bp of the wild-type fibrinogen β promoter (pGL3-FGB wild-type) or a 400-bp fibrinogen β promoter fragment with the core C/EBP site at –133/–125 changed from GTTGCTTAA to GTTTAGTAA (pGL3-FGB C/EBPmut). The polymorphisms in this construct (at –249 and –148) are represented by their common alleles. The DNA sequences of the regions spanning from –166 to –118 in the mutant and wild-type constructs are shown in Table II.Table IISequences of the wild-type and mutant fibrinogen β promoter variants Open table in a new tab Vectors Expressing Transcription Factors—Vectors expressing HNF-3α, HNF-3β, HNF-3γ, and C/EBPβ (pcDNA3.1-HNF3α, pCDNA3.1-HNF3β, pCDNA3.1-HNF3γ, and pSCT-C/EBPβ, all from rat origin) and their empty counterparts (pCDNA3.1- and pSCT-) were the kind gifts from Dr. P. Holthuizen (Department of Physiological Chemistry, University of Utrecht, The Netherlands). Antibodies—Polyclonal antibodies directed against HNF-3β (M-20 sc-6554X) and HNF-3γ (N-19 sc-5361X) were obtained from Santa Cruz Biotechnology, and antibodies directed against HNF-3α (2000007) were obtained from Active Motif. Transfection Conditions—HepG2 and HuH7 cells were plated in 24-well plates in DMEM with 10% fetal bovine serum at a density of 1.0 × 105 cells/well. After allowing the cells to attach overnight, the medium was replaced by DMEM with 0.1% human serum albumin (HSA, Cealb®). After 2 h, cells were transfected using FuGENE 6 (Roche Applied Science), according to the manufacturer's protocol. 200 ng of pGL3 construct and 4 ng of pRL-tk (Renilla luciferase expression construct, Promega) to correct for differences in transfection efficiency were used per well. If applicable, vectors expressing HNF-3α, HNF-3β, HNF-3γ, C/EBPβ, or a molar equivalent of the empty expression vector as control were added, and the total amount of DNA was kept at 400 ng per well with carrier DNA (herring sperm, Invitrogen). The effect of the empty expression vectors on fibrinogen β promoter activity and on the Renilla luciferase expression was determined for all conditions, and no effects of the empty control vectors were detected. For each construct at least two independent DNA preparations were used, and all DNA preparations were transfected at least twice in triplicate. 24 h after transfection, the medium was replaced by DMEM with 0.1% HSA, containing IL6 concentrations ranging from 0 to 15 ng/ml (recombinant human IL6, h). Luciferase Assay—After culturing the cells for 24 h in the presence of IL6, cells were washed with 500 μl of phosphate-buffered saline and lysed with Passive Lysis Buffer (Promega). The firefly luciferase reporter and Renilla luciferase internal control activities were measured with a luminometer (Berthold), using the Dual-Luciferase® Reporter Assay System (Promega). Preparation of Nuclear Extracts—HepG2 cells were cultured under serum-free conditions (DMEM with 0.1% HSA) for 24 h prior to preparation of the nuclear extracts. For the preparation of nuclear extracts of IL6-stimulated cells, cells were incubated with 5 ng/ml IL6 for 15 min. Cells were washed and lysed, and nuclear extracts were prepared according to the method of Slomiany et al. (32Slomiany B.A. Kelly M.M. Kurtz D.T. BioTechniques. 2000; 28: 938-942Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). Buffers were supplemented with a protease inhibitor mixture (Complete™ Mini, Roche Applied Science) and with phosphatase inhibitors (250 μm sodium orthovanadate and 25 mm β-glycerophosphate). The protein concentration in the extracts was estimated using the BCA micro kit (Pierce), and the samples were stored at –80 °C for future use. Oligonucleotides—Double-stranded 26-bp oligonucleotides including the wild-type HNF-3 site at –159/–151, (Fib β HNF3wt (wild type)) or the mutated HNF-3 site (Fib β HNF3 mut) were designed. In addition, a double-stranded 21-bp HNF-3 consensus oligonucleotide was designed according to the consensus sequence provided by Locker (33Locker J. Locker J. Transcription Factors: Essential Data. John Wiley & Sons Ltd., Chichester, UK1996: 12-55Google Scholar) (Table II). Pairs of oligonucleotides were annealed at equimolar amounts and radioactively labeled at the 5′ ends with [γ-32P]ATP (Amersham Biosciences) using T4 kinase (Invitrogen). The double-stranded and labeled oligonucleotides were purified by using Micro-Spin G-25 columns (Amersham Biosciences) and stored at –20 °C for future use. Binding Reaction and Electrophoresis—To demonstrate the presence of HNF3α, -β, and -γ, Western blot analysis was performed. Nuclear extracts from HepG2 cells grown in the absence or presence of IL6 (10 ng/ml), and rat liver nuclear extracts (Active Motif) were separated on 8% SDS-polyacrylamide gels. Gels were blotted on Protran BA83 cellulose-nitrate filters (Schleicher & Schuell), and the filters were incubated first with HNF3α rabbit IgG (Active Motif), HNF3β goat IgG, or HNF3γ goat IgG (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) and subsequently with peroxidase-labeled swine anti-rabbit or anti-goat antibodies (DAKO Cytomation). Bands were visualized by using chemiluminescence (Western Lightning™ Chemiluminescence Reagent Plus, PerkinElmer Life Sciences). For each binding reaction, 3 μg of nuclear extract was preincubated for 30 min on ice with 5 μg of poly(dI-dC) (Amersham Biosciences) in a 12-μl reaction mixture containing 10 mm Hepes (pH 7.9), 100 mm KCl, 25 mm MgCl2, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 0.05 mm EDTA, 0.1% (v/v) Nonidet P-40, 10% (v/v) glycerol, 0.03 mg/ml bovine serum albumin, 250 μm sodium orthovanadate, and 25 mm β-glycerophosphate. Subsequently, the labeled oligonucleotides were added to the prebinding reactions, and this mixture was incubated for another 30 min on ice. If applicable, 3 μg of antibody directed against HNF-3 was added, and the reaction was incubated for an additional 30 min on ice. Competition assays were performed by adding a 100-fold molar excess of unlabeled oligonucleotides to the radioactive oligonucleotides, prior to their addition to the binding reaction. The reaction products were loaded onto 5% nondenaturing polyacrylamide gels and run in 0.25× TBE (1× TBE: 0.1 m Tris, 0.09 m boric acid, 0.001 m EDTA). Gels were blotted onto Whatman paper, and the bands were visualized by autoradiography. The inhibition of endogenous HNF3β expression was performed with 0.32 μmol/liter siRNA targeted to exon 3 of HNF3β (Silencer™ Pre-Designed siRNA, Ambion), which was transfected into HepG2 cells using siPORT™ Lipid Transfection Agent (Ambion) following the manufacturer's protocol. Four hours after transfection, 1 ml of medium was added, and cells were incubated in the absence or presence of 10 ng/ml IL6. After 18 h, culture medium was harvested, and mRNA was isolated from the cells. The effect of siRNA on mRNA expression of HNF3β and fibrinogen β was established by quantitative reverse transcription-PCR (Taqman) with predesigned primers from Applied Biosystems. Porphobilinogen deaminase mRNA concentration was used for normalization. The effects of lowered levels of the transcription factor HNF3β on endogenous fibrinogen protein production by HepG2 cells was investigated by measuring the fibrinogen concentration in the culture medium with an in-house fibrinogen enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay using polyclonal antibodies to fibrinogen (Dako). Firefly luciferase activity was normalized for transfection efficiency by using Renilla luciferase activity as the internal standard. These normalized luciferase activity levels were expressed as a percentage of the normalized luciferase activity of the pGL3-FGB Haplo b (Figs. 2, 3, 4a), pGL-3 FGB wild-type (Figs. 4b and 5), or pGL3-FGB Haplo d (Fig. 7) constructs at base line, depending on the combination of constructs used in the experiments. Normalized relative luciferase expression levels were compared by analysis of variance testing followed by LSD post hoc testing, or with Student's t test. SPSS 11.0 for Windows was used.Fig. 3Response of fibrinogen β promoter variants to IL6. Fibrinogen β promoter-reporter gene constructs were transfected into HepG2 cells, and cells were subsequently treated with IL6. At all IL6 concentrations, the IL6-induced activity of the fibrinogen b promoter haplotype b was significantly higher than the induced activity of the HNF-3 mutant promoter (Haplo b HNF3mut) (p < 0.0003 at all IL6 concentrations) and was higher than the induced activity of the haplo-type b′-148T promoter variant (Haplo b′-148T) (p < 0.001 at all IL6 concentrations).

The C/EBPβ-induced promoter activity of haplotype b was also significantly higher than the C/EBPβ-induced promoter activity of haplotype b′-148T (p < 0.0005 at all C/EBPβ concentrations).

Normalized luciferase activities are expressed relative to base-line activity of the FGB wild-type construct. Differences in activity between the wild-type promoter and the C/EBP mutant were significant at all concentrations of HNF-3β expression vector (p < 0.005) (left panel). In addition, the FGB wild-type promoter responded significantly stronger than the C/EBP mutant to 500 pg of cotransfected C/EBPβ expression vector (p = 0.002), and to 2.5 ng/ml IL6 (p = 0.01) (right panel).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Fig. 5Enhancement of fibrinogen β promoter activity by HNF-3β, IL6, and C/EBPβ.

https://openalex.org/W2037219695,"Genetic alterations affecting β-catenin, adenomatous polyposis coli or axin proteins are associated with the pathogenesis of numerous human tumors. All these mutations result in the synthesis of unphosphorylated β-catenin that escapes recognition by the β transducin repeat protein (βTrCP1), the receptor of an ubiquitin. The stabilized β-catenin translocates to the nucleus and activates the transcription of genes crucial for tumorigenesis. Recent evidence implicates mutations and overexpresssion of βTrCP1 in human prostate and colon tumors, respectively, suggesting that deregulated βTrCP1 may be involved in tumorigenesis. To explore this possibility further, we generated transgenic mice that specifically express a dominant-negative mutant of βTrCP1 (ΔFβTrCP1) or full-length βTrCP1 in intestine, liver and kidney. We found that 46% (16/35) of the transgenic mice that overexpressed the transgenes developed either intestinal adenomas (10/35) or hepatic (4/35) or urothelial (2/35) tumors. Immunohistological analysis of the tumors revealed that upregulation of cyclin D1, glutamine synthetase and chemotaxin 2 was associated with nuclear accumulation of β-catenin. These results show that the overexpression of ΔFβTrCP1 or βTrCP1 in vivo induce tumors through β-catenin activation."

https://openalex.org/W2140234194,"cDNA arrays were used to examine gene induction in CALU-6 and H460 lung cancer cells mediated by sequential 5-aza 2'-deoxycytidine (DAC)/depsipeptide FK228 (DP) exposure in order to identify translational end points for clinical trials evaluating these agents. In both cell lines, sequential DAC/DP treatment induced expression of tissue factor pathway inhibitor-2 (TFPI-2), an inhibitor of Factor VII: tissue factor signal transduction known to diminish the malignant phenotype of cancer cells. TFPI-2 expression was diminished or absent in 16 of 32 cell lines established from thoracic malignancies. Sequential DAC/DP treatment induced TFPI-2 in cancer cells deficient for TFPI-2 expression in the basal state. Promoter methylation coincided with loss of TFPI-2 expression in a number of cancer lines. TFPI-2 promoter methylation was observed in one of five pulmonary adenocarcinomas, and seven of seven esophageal adenocarcinomas, but not corresponding normal tissues. DP enhanced acetylation of TFPI-2-associated histones in CALU-6 cells. DP or PDBU, alone, induced TFPI-2 expression in cancer cells deficient for TFPI-2 expression in the absence of promoter methylation. In these cells, DP-mediated TFPI-2 induction was abrogated by calphostin. Induction of TFPI-2 by distinct, yet cooperative mechanisms involving chromatin remodeling and PKC signaling strengthens the preclinical rationale for sequential administration of DNA demethylating agents and HDAC inhibitors in cancer patients. Furthermore, induction of TFPI-2 may be a useful surrogate marker of treatment response in individuals receiving sequential DAC/DP infusions."
https://openalex.org/W2054413834,"c-myc is a well-known proto-oncogene encoding for a transcription factor that needs to be tightly regulated in order to preserve cell homeostasis. The Promyelocytic Leukaemia gene product PML plays an important role in cell growth and survival, and resides in discrete subnuclear structures called Nuclear Bodies (NB). We performed comparative analysis of the expression of 40 Myc target genes and of Myc binding to their regulatory regions both in wild-type and PML knockout cells. We demonstrate that if PML is absent, despite Myc binding to the DNA regulatory sequences is unchanged, the expression profile of several Myc target genes is altered. PML is largely involved in gene regulation, via recruitment of several transcription factors and cofactors to the NB. Consistently, we show that Myc partially localizes to the NB and physically interacts with PML, and that this localization depends on Myc expression levels. As deregulation occurs to both activated and repressed Myc target genes, we propose that PML influences Myc transcriptional activity through a mechanism that involves the control of Myc post-translational modifications."

Cells accumulated in G2/M showed elevated levels of an inactive form of cyclin B1/p-Cdc2 (Tyr15) complex that was not associated with activation of Chk1/p-Cdc25C and was independent of p53/p21 status. The most prominent feature of cell death was the appearance of enlarged and multinucleated cells that was related to the inhibition of mitotic entry. In contrast, BG-resistant cell lines, HCT116 BBR and HCT15 BBR cells that contain mutations K165E and K165N of MGMT, respectively, displayed a normal cell cycle progression with a slight and transient increase in G2/M arrest at 24 h after treatments with either BCNU alone or BG combined with BCNU. The differences in the ability to progress toward G2/M after treatment with BG and BCNU between cells expressing wild-type MGMT and mutated MGMT were confirmed in CHO cells transfected with human wild type and K165E mutant MGMT cDNA, respectively. Thus, our findings suggest that BG-inactivated MGMT may be linked to cell signaling events, forcing cells into a permanent G2/M arrest in response to the DNA damages induced by BCNU."
https://openalex.org/W2039832564,"Overexpression of c-Jun enables Rat1a cells to grow in an anchorage-independent manner. We used an inducible c-Jun system under the regulation of doxycycline in Rat1a cells to identify potential c-Jun target genes necessary for c-Jun-induced anchorage-independent growth. Induction of c-Jun results in sustained expression of cyclin A in the nonadherent state with only minimal expression in the absence of c-Jun. The promoter activity of cyclin A2 was 4-fold higher in Rat1a cells in which c-Jun expression was induced compared with the control cells. Chromatin immunoprecipitation demonstrated that c-Jun bound directly to the cyclin A2 promoter. Mutation analysis of the cyclin A2 promoter mapped the c-Jun regulatory site to an ATF site at position –80. c-Jun was able to bind to this site both in vitro and in vivo, and mutation of this site completely abolished promoter activity. Cyclin A1 was also elevated in c-Jun-overexpressing Rat1a cells; however, c-Jun did not regulate this gene directly, since it did not bind directly to the cyclin A1 promoter. Suppression of cyclin A expression via the introduction of a cyclin A antisense sequences significantly reduced the ability of c-Jun-overexpressing Rat1a cells to grow in an anchorage-independent fashion. Taken together, these results suggest that cyclin A is a target of c-Jun and is necessary but not sufficient for c-Jun-induced anchorage-independent growth. In addition, we demonstrated that the cytoplasmic oncogenes Ras and Src transcriptionally activated the cyclin A2 promoter via the ATF site at position –80. Using a dominant negative c-Jun mutant, TAM67, we showed that this transcriptional activation of cyclin A2 requires c-Jun. Thus, our results suggest that c-Jun is a mediator of the aberrant cyclin A2 expression associated with Ras/Src-induced transformation.

It binds to these sites as either a homodimer or a heterodimer together with Fos family members (c-Fos, FosB, Fra-1, and Fra-2) or ATF family members (ATF-1 to -4, CREB1, or CREM1). c-Jun is a versatile transcription factor and contributes to transformation and tumor aggressiveness (1Hartl M.

Cyclins D1, E, and A can function as oncogenes when aberrantly expressed, and p19ARF, p53, p21cip1, p27kip1, and Rb are suppressor genes whose reduction, deletion, or inactivation causes transformation (15Soussi T.

Bossy-Wetzel E. Yaniv M. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 2056-2068Crossref PubMed Scopus (330) Google Scholar), p53 (10Schreiber M. Kolbus A. Piu F. Szabowski A. Mohle-Steinlein U. Tian J. Karin M. Angel P.

Commun. 2000; 270: 303-310Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). However, there have been few reports on whether the alteration of expression of these cell cycle related proteins by c-Jun plays a role in cell transformation.We have previously described a cellular model system where c-Jun is inducibly expressed under the control of a doxycycline-responsive promoter, which induces nonadherent cell growth (39Kinoshita I.

Oncogene. 2003; 22: 5619-5629Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). Using this c-Jun-inducible system, we examined the effect of c-Jun on cell cycle regulators to investigate the hypothesis that direct regulation of cell cycle genes by c-Jun is necessary for c-Jun induction of nonadherent cell growth of Rat1a cells. We demonstrate that of all cell cycle proteins, only cyclin A demonstrated dysregulation under c-Jun expression. Further, c-Jun binds to the ATF site in the cyclin A2 promoter and enhanced cyclin A expression under nonadherent growth conditions. c-Jun also enhanced cyclin A1 expression under these conditions, although it did not interact directly with the cyclin A1 promoter. Inhibition of cyclin A expression resulted in a decrease in the ability of the cells to form colonies in soft agar; however, overexpression of cyclin A alone did not enable the cells to grow in an anchorage-independent manner. Taken together, these results demonstrate that cyclin A2 is a direct target of c-Jun and is necessary, but not sufficient, for c-Jun-induced anchorage-independent growth.MATERIALS AND METHODSCell Lines, Culture Conditions, and Antibodies—Rat1a cells expressing either c-Jun (Rat1a-J4 and Rat1a-hemagglutinin (HA) 1The abbreviations used are: HA, hemagglutinin; EGFR, epidermal growth factor receptor; CREB, cAMP-response element-binding protein; CREM, cAMP-response element modulator; CMV, cytomegalovirus; Dox, doxycycline. -Jun) or green fluorescent protein (Rat1a-GFP) in a doxycycline-controlled manner were established from parental Rat1a cells as previously described (39Kinoshita I.

All fragments were 5′-end-labeled with T4 polynucleotide kinase, and gel mobility shift and supershift assays were carried out as previously described (14Hommura F. Katabami M. Leaner V.D.

Amati) was used to establish Rat1a cells stably expressing cyclin A. Briefly, 10 μg of the retroviral expression vector was transfected into PhoenixA cells, and the supernatant was harvested and used to infect Rat1a fibroblasts. 48 h after infection, the cells were serially diluted, and clones were selected with 200 μg/ml hygromycin B (Calbiochem). Rat1a cells able to express cyclin A in an inducible fashion were also established as follows. An EcoRI fragment from pCEM4 containing the human cyclin A cDNA was cloned into pBlueScript II SK(±). An XhoI-NotI fragment from pBlueScript-cyclin A was cloned into the pLRT retroviral vector to construct pLRT-cyclin A. pLRT-cyclin A was transfected into Rat1a cells using the standard calcium phosphate method, and clones were selected using blasticidin (8 μg/ml).Colony Forming Assay—1.0 × 104 cells were plated in triplicate in 6 ml of 0.8% agarose (sea plaque) in complete growth medium in the presence or absence of 2 μg/ml doxycycline overlaid on a 0.4% agarose base, also in complete growth medium. 3–4 weeks after incubation, colonies more than 50 μm in diameter were counted using an Omnicon 3600 image analysis system. The colonies were visualized after staining for 16–24 h with 1.0 mg/ml p-iodonitrotetrazolium violet.Kinase Assays—Cyclin A-associated kinase activity in the c-Jun expressing Rat1a cells was measured using the Cdk1/Cdc2 kinase assay kit (Upstate Biotechnology, Inc., Charlottesville, VA) as described by the manufacturer.Cell Proliferation Assays—c-Jun-expressing Rat1a cells were seeded at 5000 cells/well in 96-well plates in normal growth medium containing 1% methylcellulose (Sigma) in the presence or absence of 2 μg/ml doxycycline, and cell growth was measured by 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide assays.Chromatin Immunoprecipitation—Rat1a-HA-Jun cells expressing HA-tagged c-Jun were seeded at a density of 10 × 106 cells in 150-mm PolyHeme-coated tissue culture dishes in the presence and absence of 2 μg/ml doxycycline and incubated for 4 days at 37 °C. Protein-DNA complexes were cross-linked with 1% formaldehyde added directly to the culture medium at room temperature for 15 min followed by the addition of 0.125 m glycine, pH 2.5, for 5 min. Cells were pelleted at 1500 rpm for 5 min at 4 °C and washed once with ice-cold PBS. The cell pellet was resuspended in 300 μl of lysis buffer (1% SDS, 5 mm EDTA, 50 mm Tris, pH 8, 100 μg/ml aprotinin, 100 μg/ml leupeptin, and 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride) and incubated on ice for 10 min. The solution was then sonicated 3 times for 15 s each on maximum power, and cell debris was pelleted by centrifugation for 5 min at 13,000 rpm. Twenty microliters of the soluble chromatin was set aside as the input fraction, and the remainder was diluted 1:10 in dilution buffer (1% Triton X-100, 2 mm EDTA, 150 mm NaCl, 20 mm Tris, pH 8, 100 μg/ml aprotinin, 100 μg/ml leupeptin, and 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride). The diluted soluble chromatin (1 ml) was precleared with 2 μg of sheared herring sperm DNA, 20 μl of preimmune serum, and 45 μl of protein G-agarose beads (50% slurry in 10 mm Tris, pH 8, 1 mm EDTA) for 2 h at 4 °C, and the beads were pelleted by centrifugation at 13,000 rpm for 1 min. Two micrograms of antibodies to hemagglutinin (71–5500; Zymed Laboratories Inc., San Francisco, CA) or control rabbit IgG (sc-2027; Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Santa Cruz, CA) were added, and the solution was incubated overnight at 4 °C. Following this incubation, 45 μl of protein G-agarose beads and 2 μg of sheared herring sperm DNA were added and incubated for an additional 1 h at 4 °C. The beads were pelleted by centrifugation and washed sequentially for 10 min each with TSE I (0.1% SDS, 1% Triton X-100, 2 mm EDTA, 20 mm Tris, pH 8, 150 mm NaCl), TSE II (0.1% SDS, 1% Triton X-100, 2 mm EDTA, 20 mm Tris, pH 8, 500 mm NaCl), buffer III (0.25 m LiCl, 1% Nonidet P-40, 1% deoxycholate, 1 mm EDTA, 10 mm Tris, pH 8), and TE (10 mm Tris, pH 8, 1 mm EDTA). DNA was eluted from the beads with 100 μlof elution buffer (1% SDS, 0.1 m NaHCO3), and the cross-links were reversed by incubation at 65 °C overnight. DNA was purified using the Qiaquick PCR Purification kit (Qiagen, Valencia, CA) as per the manufacturer's instructions.One microliter of the chromatin immunoprecipitation DNA was amplified by real time PCR with primers cycA-F (5′-CCTCAGGCTCCCGCCCTGTAAGATTCC-3′) and cycA-R (5′-TCAAGTAGCCCGCGACTATTGAATAT-3′) on an iCycler real time detection system (Bio-Rad) with the Quantitect SYBR Green PCR Kit (Qiagen Inc., Valencia, CA) as per the manufacturer's instructions. The -fold change was calculated using the 2–ΔΔCT method as previously described (44Livak K.J. Schmittgen T.D.

We hypothesized that this c-Jun-mediated nonadherent growth might be the result of direct regulation by c-Jun of cell cycle genes. Western blot analysis was performed in order to determine the levels of various cell cycle-related proteins. The level of cyclin A in Rat1a-J4 cells grown for 3 days under nonadherent conditions in the presence of doxycycline was increased compared with cells grown in the absence of doxycycline or Rat1a-GFP cells (Fig. 1A). The levels of cyclins D1, E, and B1, on the other hand, remained unchanged between the cells overexpressing c-Jun and control cells (Fig. 1A). Expression of p16Ink4a, p19ARF, and p57Kip2 remained the same between the uninduced and induced conditions. Similar results were obtained in another Rat1a clone (Rat1a-J2) overexpressing c-Jun (see Supplemental Material).Cyclin A-dependent Kinase Activity Is Increased in Rat1a Cells Overexpressing c-Jun—To determine whether this increase in cyclin A expression was accompanied by a concomitant increase in cyclin A-dependent kinase activity, extracts from Rat1a-J4 cells grown in the absence or presence of doxycycline were assayed for cyclin A-associated kinase activity. Cyclin A-associated kinase activity was ∼3.5-fold higher in the c-Jun-overexpressing Rat1a cells than in the control cells (Fig. 1B), confirming that the increase in cyclin A expression was accompanied by an increase in its associated kinase activity.c-Jun Enhances Expression of Cyclin A at a Transcriptional Level—Time course experiments showed that the cyclin A protein levels in the control Rat1a cells decreased ∼2.5-fold over time when the cells were grown in suspension; however, when c-Jun was induced in these cells, cyclin A levels were sustained (Fig. 2A) This pattern of expression was also observed at the transcriptional level. Northern blot analysis showed that cyclin A mRNA in the c-Jun-overexpressing cells remained elevated compared with cells grown in the uninduced state (Fig. 2B). In the control Rat1a-GFP cells, cyclin A mRNA rapidly decreased when the cells were grown under nonadherent conditions (data not shown). Analysis of the cyclin A mRNA half-life confirmed that the increase in cyclin A expression was transcriptional rather than due to increased stability of the mRNA (Fig. 3). No difference in cyclin A mRNA half-lives was observed between Rat1a-J4 cells in the uninduced and induced states, with both having a half-life of ∼30 min (Fig. 3). A similar result was obtained using the other c-Jun-overexpressing Rat1a clone, Rat1a-J2 (see Supplemental Material), suggesting that these results are not due to clonal variation.Fig. 2c-Jun enhances cyclin A expression in Rat1a-J4 cells grown under nonadherent conditions. Rat1a-J4 and GFP cells were grown in suspension in the absence (–) or presence (+) of 2 μg/ml doxycycline. Proteins and RNA were extracted at the indicated times and analyzed for cyclin A expression by Western (A) or Northern (B) blotting, respectively.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Fig. 3The cyclin A2 mRNA half-life remains unchanged after induction of c-Jun. Rat1a-J4 cells were maintained under nonadherent growth conditions for 3 days in the absence (–) or presence (+) of 2 μg/ml doxycycline, after which actinomycin D (10 μg/ml) was added for the indicated times. RNA was then isolated and subjected to Northern blot analysis. The intensity of the bands was quantitated densitometrically.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Since there are two distinct cyclin A genes in mammals, Ccna1 and Ccna2, encoding cyclin A1 and cyclin A2, respectively, we analyzed our Rat1a cells to determine whether c-Jun expression enhanced cyclin A1 as well. Western blot analysis using an antibody specific to cyclin A1 showed that its expression was enhanced in Rat1a-J4 cells grown under nonadherent conditions (Fig. 4). Furthermore, the p"

For example, Mg2+ is a cofactor for the N-ethylmaleimide-sensitive factor (NSF) ATPase, and the Ca2+ signal from neuronal membrane depolarization is required for synaptotagmin activation. Divalent cations also regulate liposome fusion, but the role of such ion interactions with lipid bilayers in Rab- and soluble NSF attachment protein receptor (SNARE)-dependent biological membrane fusion is less clear. Yeast vacuole fusion requires Mg2+ for Sec18p ATPase activity, and vacuole docking triggers an efflux of luminal Ca2+. We now report distinct reaction conditions where divalent or monovalent ions interchangeably regulate Rab- and SNARE-dependent vacuole fusion. In reactions with 5 mm Mg2+, other free divalent ions are not needed. Reactions containing low Mg2+ concentrations are strongly inhibited by the rapid Ca2+ chelator BAPTA. However, addition of the soluble SNARE Vam7p relieves BAPTA inhibition as effectively as Ca2+ or Mg2+, suggesting that Ca2+ does not perform a unique signaling function. When the need for Mg2+, ATP, and Sec18p for fusion is bypassed through the addition of Vam7p, vacuole fusion does not require any appreciable free divalent cations and can even be stimulated by their chelators. The similarity of these findings to those with liposomes, and the higher ion specificity of the regulation of proteins, suggests a working model in which ion interactions with bilayer lipids permit Rab- and SNARE-dependent membrane fusion.

Eukaryotic subcellular compartmentation requires selective membrane fusion. This fusion depends on specific lipids and conserved proteins, including SNAREs 1The abbreviations used are: SNARE, soluble NSF attachment protein receptor; BAPTA, 1,2-bis-(o-aminophenoxy)ethane-N,N,N′,N′-tetraacetic acid; TPEN, N,N,N′,N′-tetrakis-(2-pryidylmethyl)ethylenediamine; HOPS, homotypic fusion and vacuole protein sorting complex; PS, phosphatidylserine; PC, phosphatidylcholine; NSF, N-ethylmaleimide-sensitive factor. 1The abbreviations used are: SNARE, soluble NSF attachment protein receptor; BAPTA, 1,2-bis-(o-aminophenoxy)ethane-N,N,N′,N′-tetraacetic acid; TPEN, N,N,N′,N′-tetrakis-(2-pryidylmethyl)ethylenediamine; HOPS, homotypic fusion and vacuole protein sorting complex; PS, phosphatidylserine; PC, phosphatidylcholine; NSF, N-ethylmaleimide-sensitive factor. and their chaperones, Rab family GTPases, Rab effectors, and divalent cations (1Jahn R. Lang T. Sudhof T.C. Cell. 2003; 112: 519-533Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1200) Google Scholar). For example, membrane fusion at the synapse is triggered by an afferent wave of electrical depolarization, which opens a voltage-gated Ca2+ channel. The Ca2+ that enters binds to intracellular receptors, most notably the C2 domains of synaptotagmin, triggering a conformational change, which alters synaptotagmin interactions with SNAREs and with the apolar domain of the membrane bilayer (2Chapman E.R. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2002; 3: 498-508Crossref PubMed Scopus (369) Google Scholar). Although Ca2+ clearly regulates synaptic membrane fusion, in other membrane fusion events the Ca2+ channel, the trigger for Ca2+ flux, the Ca2+ receptor, and the modes of action of the receptors have received less study. The vacuole (lysosome) of Saccharomyces cerevisiae is the major repository of cellular Ca2+ (3Dunn T. Gable K. Beeler T. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 7273-7278Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Calcium is pumped into the vacuole by Pmc1p, an ATP-driven Ca2+ transporter (4Cunningham K.W. Fink G.R. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 124: 351-363Crossref PubMed Scopus (354) Google Scholar), and by Vcx1p, a Ca2+/H+ exchanger (5Cunningham K.W. Fink G.R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 2226-2237Crossref PubMed Scopus (375) Google Scholar). Vacuole homotypic fusion occurs in three stages: ATP-dependent priming, docking, and finally bilayer fusion and content mixing (6Wickner W. EMBO J. 2002; 21: 1241-1247Crossref PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar). Docking is complex and requires Ypt7p (a Rab family GTPase), the HOPS (homotypic fusion and vacuole protein sorting)/Vps Class C complex (a Ypt7p effector that also binds to SNAREs), and the SNARE proteins Vam7p, Vam3p, Vti1p, and Nyv1p. The last stage of docking, the pairing of SNAREs in trans, triggers a dramatic release of luminal Ca2+ from the vacuole (7Peters C. Mayer A. Nature. 1998; 396: 575-580Crossref PubMed Scopus (322) Google Scholar, 8Merz A.J. Wickner W.T. J. Cell Biol. 2004; 164: 195-206Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). Experiments demonstrating the sensitivity of vacuole fusion to the Ca2+ chelator BAPTA, the relief of BAPTA sensitivity by added Ca2+, and the docking-dependent release of Ca2+ from the vacuole lumen (8Merz A.J. Wickner W.T. J. Cell Biol. 2004; 164: 195-206Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar, 9Eitzen G. Will E. Gallwitz D. Haas A. Wickner W. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 6713-6720Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar) have suggested that Ca2+ may signal successful docking and initiate the terminal stage of membrane fusion. Vacuole fusion requires the calcium-binding protein calmodulin (7Peters C. Mayer A. Nature. 1998; 396: 575-580Crossref PubMed Scopus (322) Google Scholar), strengthening the connection between free Ca2+ and the downstream processes leading to vacuole fusion. Several observations now lead us to re-examine the role of free Ca2+, and other ions, in vacuole fusion. Although the Ca2+ chelator BAPTA inhibits a late stage of vacuole fusion (10Ungermann C. Wickner W. Xu Z. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 11194-11199Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar), BAPTA also inhibits the membrane association of two crucial peripheral membrane proteins, Vam7p and the HOPS/Vps class C complex, which do not have Ca2+ binding motifs. BAPTA, a tetravalent ion, may release these proteins from the membrane, and inhibit vacuole fusion, through its contribution to ionic strength. Vacuole fusion is commonly measured by an assay coupled to the activity of the zinc-metalloenzyme Pho8p, which is sensitive to divalent ion chelators (11Plankert U. Purwin C. Holzer H. Eur. J. Biochem. 1991; 196: 191-196Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). We now report that fusion assays with 5 mm Mg2+ show little sensitivity to BAPTA when they are adjusted to a constant ionic strength and are performed in the presence of the heavy metal ion chelator TPEN (to obviate the effect of Zn2+ chelation by BAPTA). At low Mg2+, the inhibition by BAPTA is not simply due to its ionic strength contribution, yet BAPTA inhibition can be bypassed by altering KCl, Mg2+, and Vam7p concentrations. Finally, under conditions that bypass the need for ATP or Sec18p, Ypt7p- and SNARE-dependent vacuole fusion requires moderate (125–250 mm) KCl but does not require appreciable free divalent cations; at certain KCl concentrations, fusion can even be stimulated by divalent ion chelators. We suggest a working model in which Mg2+, Ca2+, and monovalent ions interact with the lipid bilayer to regulate vacuole fusion.

Vacuole Isolation and in Vitro Fusion Assay Conditions—Vacuoles were isolated as described previously (13Haas A. Conradt B. Wickner W. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 126: 87-97Crossref PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar). Vacuoles were purified from ade2–1oc strains VSY3, VSY4, VSY5, VSY6, VSY7, and VSY8 after growth in YPD with 0.002% (w/v) adenine hemisulfate (from a 2% stock dissolved in Me2SO). In vitro fusion reactions contained 3 μg of pep4Δ vacuoles (from BJ3505) and 3 μg of pho8Δ vacuoles (from DKY6281). The following three fusion reaction conditions were used in this work: (a) high Mg2+ fusion reactions contained 20 mm PIPES-KOH, pH 6.8, 200 mm sorbitol, 125 mm KCl, 6 mm MgCl2, 1 mm ATP (Amersham Biosciences), 1 mg/ml creatine kinase (Roche Applied Science), 29 mm creatine phosphate (Roche Applied Science), 10 μm coenzyme A (Sigma), and 330 nm purified Pbi2p (IB2) (26Slusarewicz P.

Bypass reactions contained 10 mm PIPES-KOH, pH 6.8, 200 mm sorbitol, 125 mm KCl, 10 μm coenzyme A, 2.8 μm recombinant Vam7p, and 330 nm purified IB2. All reaction components except the vacuoles were mixed on ice. Vacuoles purified from pep4Δ and pho8Δ strains were premixed in equal amounts on ice and were added last to each reaction (6 μg of total per reaction). Reactions were incubated at 27 °C for 90 min unless otherwise noted. After fusion, reactions were assayed for alkaline phosphatase activity (27Haas A. Meth. Cell Sci. 1995; 17: 283-294Crossref Scopus (99) Google Scholar) with 10 mm CaCl2 included in the assay solution. Samples were centrifuged (16,000 × g, 2 min) just prior to spectrophotometric measurement to remove any precipitates. Fusion units are micromolar of para-nitrophenyl phosphate min–1 μg of vacuole–1. Protein concentrations were determined with a Bio-Rad protein assay kit (Bio-Rad), using bovine serum albumin as standard. We assay the fusion of yeast vacuoles that are purified from two strains, one that accumulates catalytically inactive proalkaline phosphatase due to the absence of vacuole luminal proteases, and the other that has the normal proteases but is deleted for the PHO8 phosphatase gene (13Haas A. Conradt B. Wickner W. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 126: 87-97Crossref PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar). Upon vacuole fusion, the proteases gain access to the proPho8p and cleave it to the catalytically active form, Pho8p. This active form can be assayed colorimetrically and is a quantitative measurement of the extent of vacuole fusion. Pho8p has tightly bound Zn2+ and Cu2+, although only the Zn2+ is needed for phosphatase activity (11Plankert U. Purwin C. Holzer H. Eur. J. Biochem. 1991; 196: 191-196Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). The roles of divalent cations in fusion can be explored with chelators such as EDTA, BAPTA, and TPEN, each with their characteristic affinities for divalent cations (Table I). BAPTA inhibits in vitro vacuole fusion (Fig. 1; compare squares to other symbols on the ordinate). Although added Ca2+ did not stimulate fusion, its addition relieved BAPTA inhibition (Fig. 1), suggesting that the BAPTA-mediated inhibition of vacuole fusion may reflect its calcium chelation properties. When BAPTA and calcium were equimolar, however, a modest amount of fusion inhibition remained. To explore the basis of this Ca2+-indpendent inhibition, we sought BAPTA-sensitive aspects of vacuole fusion.Table IAffinity of chelators for divalent cationsChelatorApproximate Kd for divalent cation·chelator complexCa2+Mg2+Zn2+mEDTA1 × 10-77 × 10-61 × 10-13BAPTA2 × 10-73 × 10-25 × 10-aApparent Kd calculated under conditions reported in Ref. 64.TPEN2 × 10-49 × 10-22 × 10-15a Apparent Kd calculated under conditions reported in Ref. 64Aballay A.

Open table in a new tab BAPTA Releases Peripherally Bound Proteins from the Vacuolar Membrane—BAPTA can affect biological systems in ways other than calcium chelation. For example, BAPTA has been shown to depolymerize microtubules (28Saoudi Y. Rousseau B. Doussiere J. Charrasse S. Gauthier-Rouviere C. Morin N. Sautet-Laugier C. Denarier E. Scaife R. Mioskowski C.

Chem. 1986; 261: 16306-16308Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). To study additional effects of BAPTA on the vacuole, vacuoles were incubated with 2.5 mm BAPTA and separated into pellet (P) and supernatant (S) fractions by centrifugation. As seen in Fig. 2, BAPTA promoted the release of Vam7p, a peripheral membrane SNARE, and HOPS (homotypic fusion and vacuole protein sorting/Vps-Class C), a multisubunit complex that includes Vps18p, Vps33p, and Vps39p, from the vacuole membrane. The retention of these proteins on the vacuole membrane is not thought to directly require Ca2+, because these proteins lack calcium-binding motifs, although Vps11p and Vps18p do contain Zn2+-binding motifs. These data suggest that BAPTA may have multiple effects on in vitro fusion, including mechanisms that are distinct from Ca2+ chelation. BAPTA Contribution to Ionic Strength—Because elevated ionic strength is often sufficient to release peripherally bound membrane proteins, BAPTA might inhibit fusion through its contribution to ionic strength. Ionic strength is proportional to the square of the net charge borne by each ionized species in solution, according to the formula, ρ = 1/2[ΣMiC2i], where ρ is the ionic strength, Mi is the molarity of each ion, and Ci is its net charge. Thus, K4BAPTA would contribute 10-times as much to the ionic strength as equimolar KCl. BAPTA might also chelate other metal ions such as Zn2+, which may contribute to fusion or to the catalytic activity of matured Pho8p, and BAPTA might alter the pH of an insufficiently buffered reaction. To test whether part of the BAPTA inhibition derives from its contribution to ionic strength, we made compensatory adjustments to the KCl concentration of the reactions. To control for insufficient buffering capacity, reactions were performed in 50 mm PIPES-KOH instead of the standard 20 mm. To prevent BAPTA from inhibiting through binding Zn2+, the membrane-permeant heavy-metal chelator TPEN (31Arslan P. Di Virgilio F. Beltrame M. Tsien R.Y. Pozzan T. J. Biol. Chem. 1985; 260: 2719-2727Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) was added; all fusion reactions containing 0.1 mm TPEN included 0.1 mm ZnCl2 in the final Pho8p assay solution. Vacuole fusion is inhibited by high [KCl] (Fig. 3, squares). The inhibitory effect of 3 mm BAPTA (circles) is only seen as the reaction KCl concentration rises over 100 mm and approaches inhibitory levels. During standard in vitro fusion reactions, Ca2+ concentrations rarely rise above several micromolar (8Merz A.J. Wickner W.T. J. Cell Biol. 2004; 164: 195-206Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar), and thus even 3 mm BAPTA would reduce the levels of free Ca2+ to subnanomolar. However, at the lowest concentration of KCl tested (25 mm), even 9 mm BAPTA had little effect on fusion (Fig. 3, diamonds). Under these reaction conditions, much of the inhibition of vacuole fusion by BAPTA stems from the ionic strength it contributes to the reaction rather than from its Ca2+-binding properties. Factors other than ionic strength can also make modest contributions to the BAPTA inhibition of fusion. Even when the ionic strength is kept constant through adjustment of the KCl concentration, fusion inhibition due to BAPTA (Fig. 4, bars 1 versus 2) is somewhat relieved by the inclusion of ZnCl2 in the Pho8p assay buffer (bars 3 and 4). BAPTA solutions may also contribute to adverse pH changes, because increasing the buffer from 20 to 50 mm makes a modest contribution to BAPTA resistance (bars 5 and 6). Finally, in the presence of TPEN, with its extraordinary affinity for zinc, it becomes clear that a small part of the BAPTA inhibition of our assay signal was due to zinc chelation (bars 7 and 8). In sum, salt, pH, and zinc chelation each contribute to the inhibition by BAPTA. Although vacuoles will fuse in the presence of BAPTA upon lowering the KCl concentration, the high vacuole luminal Ca2+ levels and the docking-triggered Ca2+ flux may lead to brief spurts of Ca2+ at the vacuole surface, which could conceivably act even faster than chelation by BAPTA. We therefore tested vacuoles lacking the known Ca2+ ATPase, Pmc1p, and the Ca2+/H+ exchanger, Vcx1p, for their fusion in the presence of BAPTA. These vacuoles accumulate far less luminal Ca2+ (5Cunningham K.W. Fink G.R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 2226-2237Crossref PubMed Scopus (375) Google Scholar) yet fuse normally (10Ungermann C. Wickner W. Xu Z. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 11194-11199Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). We considered that these vacuoles might be more sensitive to BAPTA under fusion conditions due to the lack of luminal calcium and that simple adjustment of [KCl] would not bypass a sensitivity to BAPTA. However, this was not the case (Fig. 5). When the [KCl] was lowered to compensate for the Ca2+ and BAPTA effects on ionic strength and when TPEN was added to 0.1 mm (Fig. 5), pmc1Δ vcx1Δ vacuoles fused as well as PMC1 VCX1 vacuoles in the presence of either added Ca2+, BAPTA, or an equimolar mixture of Ca2+·BAPTA. Strikingly, under ionic strength-adjusted conditions, fusion of either vacuole type was only minimally inhibited by concentrations of BAPTA up to 6 mm (Fig. 5B). Fusion in the presence of 6 mm BAPTA was completely sensitive to antibodies to Vam3p, a vacuolar t-SNARE, which is a hallmark of the physiological fusion pathway. Thus fusion of pmc1Δ vcx1Δ vacuoles proceeds in the presence of 6 mm BAPTA despite the reduction of luminal calcium. To ensure that the fusion seen in the presence of BAPTA occurs by the well studied pathway that requires Rab and Rho GTPases, regulatory lipids, SNAREs, and HOPS, we added inhibitory ligands that target these fusion catalysts to reactions with 50 mm PIPES-KOH, pH 6.8, 0.1 mm TPEN, 65 mm KCl, and 6 mm BAPTA. Vacuole fusion in the presence of BAPTA was sensitive to each of the tested inhibitors (Fig. 6) and therefore proceeds via the authentic, physiological pathway. As a second control, we directly determined the effective concentration and the calcium-chelating properties of our BAPTA stock under fusion assay conditions. We exploited the fact that the extinction coefficient of BAPTA at 254 nm changes as it binds calcium (32Tsien R.Y. Biochemistry. 1980; 19: 2396-2404Crossref PubMed Scopus (1675) Google Scholar) to show that our BAPTA stock is ∼90% active (Fig. 7A). In addition, the dissociation constant (Kd) of BAPTA for Ca2+ under our standard vacuole fusion conditions is 126 nm (Fig. 7B), in accord with the published Kd of 107 nm (32Tsien R.Y. Biochemistry. 1980; 19: 2396-2404Crossref PubMed Scopus (1675) Google Scholar). Thus BAPTA remains an effective calcium chelator under our fusion reaction conditions.Fig. 7BAPTA chelates calcium under fusion reaction conditions. BAPTA (150 mm) was freshly dissolved in PS buffer. A, 100 μm BAPTA was mixed with 10 mm MOPS buffer, pH 7.2, 0.1 mm KCl, and CaCl2 (32Tsien R.Y. Biochemistry. 1980; 19: 2396-2404Crossref PubMed Scopus (1675) Google Scholar) (0–200 μm, prepared as a 1.0 m stock from oven-dried CaCl2) and the absorbance of the solution was measured at 254 nm using this buffer without BAPTA or CaCl2 as a blank. The extinction coefficient (ϵ) of BAPTA was determined for each [CaCl2], and was plotted against the Ca2+:BAPTA molar ratio. The intersection of the lines, calculated via a linear regression analysis (GraphPad Prism version 4.0, GraphPad Software, Inc.), measures the saturation of BAPTA by Ca2+.

An equimolar CaCl2·EGTA solution and free EGTA were added in the following proportions to give known free ([Ca2+f]), in a manner previously described (32Tsien R.Y.

Wickner W. Xu Z. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 11194-11199Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar, 19Eitzen G. Thorngren N. Wickner W. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 5650-5656Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar) that BAPTA is a reversible late-acting fusion inhibitor. We therefore tested whether elevated salt can also act as a reversible late-acting fusion inhibitor. Fusion inhibition by 6 mm BAPTA (Fig. 8B, lane 2) was relieved by 6 mm CaCl2 (lane 3). This is consistent with the BAPTA inhibition being largely due to ionic strength; because BAPTA has a charge of –4 and the stable BAPTA·Ca2+ complex has a net charge of –2, the ionic strength of an equimolar mixture of Ca2+ and BAPTA is far lower than the sum of their separate ionic strengths. Fusion in the presence of BAPTA·Ca2+ remained completely sensitive to antibodies (Fig. 8B, compare lane 3 to lanes 4–6) that inhibited the standard reaction (Fig. 8A). However, when the BAPTA inhibition was reversed by the addition of Ca2+ at 35 min, the ensuing fusion (Fig. 8B, lane 8) was fully resistant to the priming inhibitor α-Sec18p (lane 9) while remaining sensitive to α-Ypt7p or α-Vam3p (lanes 10 and 11). In a standard incubation without inhibitors, the reaction becomes resistant to each of these antibodies by 35 min (9Eitzen G. Will E. Gallwitz D. Haas A. Wickner W. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 6713-6720Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar, 19Eitzen G. Thorngren N. Wickner W. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 5650-5656Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). Thus vacuole priming can occur in the presence of BAPTA, but essential Ypt7p Rab and Vam3p SNARE functions are blocked. Fusion reactions inhibited by 250 mm KCl behave similarly in this type of experiment (Fig. 8C). Inhibition by 250 mm KCl can be reversed by diluting the reaction 2-fold to a final concentration of 125 mm KCl prior to warming the reaction to 27 °C (Fig. 8C; compare lane 2, diluted to lower the salt, to lane 6, diluted but maintained at 250 mm KCl). Reversal of salt inhibition through dilution at the start left the reaction still sensitive to each antibody (lanes 3–5). When reactions were incubated at 27 °C with 250 mm KCl, mixed with inhibitors at 30 min, then diluted to lower the salt concentration at 35 min, the pattern of fusion resembled calcium-mediated BAPTA reversal. During incubation with 250 mm KCl, the reaction had acquired resistance to α-Sec18p (compare lanes 8 and 9) but remained largely sensitive to α-Ypt7p (lane 10) or α-Vam3p (lane 11). Thus the BAPTA inhibition of fusion closely resembles inhibition caused by elevated ionic strength. We note that these results differ from our earlier studies (10Ungermann C. Wickner W. Xu Z. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 11194-11199Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar, 19Eitzen G. Thorngren N. Wickner W. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 5650-5656Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar), which had placed the action of BAPTA after the acquisition of resistance to α-Ypt7p or α-Vam3p. These earlier studies may not have allowed the inhibitory antibodies sufficient time to act before reversing the BAPTA block.

AD currently affects 4.5 million people in the United States and is anticipated to increase to more than 13 million by the year 2050 (1Hebert L.E. Scherr P.A. Bienias J.L. Bennett D.A. Evans D.A.

Disord. 2001; 15: 169-173Crossref PubMed Scopus (385) Google Scholar). Histopathologically, AD is characterized by the prevalence of senile plaques, as well as neocortical atrophy, neuronal and synaptic loss, and the formation of neuritic tangles of the microtubule-associated protein tau (3Selkoe D.J. Physiol. Rev. 2001; 81: 741-766Crossref PubMed Scopus (5170) Google Scholar). Senile plaques consist predominantly of fibrils of amyloid β (Aβ), a 39–43-amino acid peptide generated by proteolysis of the amyloid precursor protein (APP) (4Hardy J.A. Higgins G.A. Science. 1992; 256: 184-185Crossref PubMed Scopus (5120) Google Scholar). Production of Aβ has been linked genetically to AD. Recent studies (5Lacor P.N. Buniel M.C. Chang L. Fernandez S.J. Gong Y.

These oligomers then coalesce into fibrils, ultimately forming the plaques originally used to characterize the disease (5Lacor P.N. Buniel M.C. Chang L. Fernandez S.J. Gong Y. Viola K.L. Lambert M.P.

To produce Aβ, APP, a type I single-transmembrane glycoprotein, is sequentially cleaved by two aspartyl proteases, β- and γ-secretase. The initial cleavage is mediated by β-secretase (BACE1) on the luminal side of the endosomal membrane or at the cell surface (8Chyung J.H. Selkoe D.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 51035-51043Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar). BACE1 cleavage generates a secreted N-terminal product (sAPPβ) and a transmembrane N-terminal product (CTF99). Processing of CTF99 within the transmembrane domain by the γ-secretase enzyme complex generates the C-terminal end of Aβ and results in its release (9Sisodia S.S. St George-Hyslop P.H. Nat. Rev. Neurosci. 2002; 3: 281-290Crossref PubMed Scopus (487) Google Scholar). The γ-secretase enzyme is known to cleave CTF99 at any of several discrete positions, generating Aβ peptides that range in length from 38 to 42 amino acids. Although Aβ40 is the predominant species produced both in vitro and in vivo, Aβ42 is the more aggregenic species and the major component of amyloid plaques. The release of Aβ42 and subsequent aggregation into insoluble fibrils are believed to lead to the formation of the dense plaques characteristic of AD (10Walsh D.M. Klyubin I. Fadeeva J.V. Rowan M.J. Selkoe D.J. Biochem. Soc. Trans. 2002; 30: 552-557Crossref PubMed Scopus (455) Google Scholar).

In contrast, molecules known as γ-secretase modulators selectively inhibit γ-secretase processing of APP at the 42 cleavage site and may have a reduced effect on processing other substrates; however, this has not been extensively studied to date. Herein we describe a novel series of benzofuran-containing compounds that inhibit APP processing by a previously undescribed mechanism of action. Although the compounds were initially identified in a search for BACE1 inhibitors, they inhibit BACE1, BACE2, and γ-secretase-mediated cleavage of APP by binding APP within the Aβ domain of the protein. Some of these inhibitors preferentially affect γ-secretase processing at the 42 cleavage site; however, their mechanism of action is distinct from γ-secretase modulators. These studies provide evidence that targeting APP may present opportunities to identify small molecules that affect APP processing and provide a novel strategy to develop chemotherapeutic agents for AD.

The compounds were dissolved in 5% Me2SO in phosphate-buffered saline. The sensorgrams were recorded at a flow rate of 30 μl/min at 30 °C. The compound was injected for 30 s. Following compound injection, 5% Me2SO/phosphate-buffered saline buffer was injected over the chip for another 30 s. A solvent correction cycle was run for each sample. Specific binding to MBP-APPFL was calculated as binding to MBP-APPFL – MBP-sAPPβNF binding. Identification of a Novel Group of Inhibitors That Inhibit BACE1 Cleavage of Full-length APP but Not Peptide Substrates—In the process of performing a high throughput screen for BACE1 inhibitors using a purified recombinant full-length APP substrate, we identified the novel benzofuran-containing compound 1 shown in Table I. The activity of compound 1 and a panel of related analogs (compounds 2–5, Table I) was evaluated using an AlphaScreen assay for BACE1 cleavage of APP (see “Experimental Procedures”). This assay is a homogeneous proximity-based method that uses donor beads binding both cleaved and uncleaved APP and acceptor beads coated with an antibody that binds only the cleaved APP product. Excitation of the donor bead triggers the release of singlet oxygen, which then stimulates the emission of light in the acceptor. With the exception of compound 4, all four analogs inhibited BACE1 cleavage of APP with IC50 values ranging from 11 to 50 μm (Table I). The effect of these compounds on BACE1 cleavage of APP was confirmed by Western blot analysis of the reaction products. For compounds 1–4 the relative potencies for APP processing inhibition did not vary significantly between the AlphaScreen and Western assays (Fig. 1, A and C, and data not shown). However, compound 5 did not inhibit APP cleavage when assayed via Western blot, and subsequent analyses suggested compound 5 may have disrupted detection in the AlphaScreen assay by triggering the precipitation of substrate (data not shown). The specificity of this class of compounds for inhibition of APP processing was established by reviewing data from over 70 assays run at ≥5 μm that included compound 2 (the most potent compound). Compound 2 was not active in a wide variety of binding, cell-based, or enzymatic activity screens (data not shown).Table IBenzofuran-containing compounds block BACE1 cleavage of APPFL but not a peptide-based substrate (P5/P5′) Open table in a new tab Fig. 1Inhibition of BACE1 cleavage of full-length APP or a β-site P5/P5′ peptide by compounds 1 and 2 or Statine-Val.

In contrast, a well characterized transition state mimic inhibitor of BACE1, Statine-Val, blocked BACE1 cleavage of the peptide and APPFL substrates (Fig. 1B) with comparable potencies, suggesting the inability of the benzofurans to block cleavage of the P5-P5′ peptide may be related to a functionally distinct mechanism of action. Compounds 1–4 Exhibit Substrate-dependent Activity on BACE1 and -2 as Well as γ-Secretase—To further examine the substrate-dependent activity of these inhibitors, we evaluated their effect on the closely related protease BACE2. Although BACE2 also processes APP at the β-site, it preferentially cleaves APP at two sites positioned at 19 and 20 amino acids within Aβ (42Farzan M. Schnitzler C.E. Vasilieva N. Leung D. Choe H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 9712-9717Crossref PubMed Scopus (347) Google Scholar), as well as at position 34 (38Shi X.P. Tugusheva K. Bruce J.E. Lucka A. Wu G.X. Chen-Dodson E. Price E.

Inhibition of BACE2 cleavage at the β-site was first tested using full-length APP and the P5-P5′ peptide as described for BACE1 (Table II). Compounds 1–3 inhibited BACE2 cleavage of full-length APP with IC50 values that were similar to inhibition of BACE1 cleavage. Compound 4 weakly inhibited full-length APP cleavage, with an IC50 value of ∼100 μm. Again, these compounds did not block BACE2 cleavage of the P5-P5′ peptide, although the transition state analog inhibitor was effective.Table IIBACE 2 inhibition with APP, peptide substrate (P9–P5′ 14-mer), or AβCompoundAPP IC50P9/P5′ IC50Aβ 19/20 (+/-)Aβ 34 (+/-)μmμm120>100Enhanced++++29>100++++++34>100-++++4∼100>100+++++5NDaND, not determined.NDNDNDa ND, not determined. Open table in a new tab The effect of compounds 1–4 on BACE2 cleavage of Aβ was tested by incubating Aβ (1–40) with BACE2 in the presence or absence of a concentration of 100 μm for each compound and resolving the cleavage products by surface-enhanced laser desorption/ionization time-of-flight mass spectrometry. Cleavage of Aβ (1–40) at position 34 was reduced by all four compounds (Fig. 2 and Table II). Surprisingly, the effect on BACE2 processing at positions 19 and 20 in Aβ was compound-specific. Compound 3 had little effect on BACE2 cleavage at positions 19 and 20, whereas compounds 2 and 4 blocked cleavage by ∼50%. In contrast, compound 1 substantially increased BACE2 cleavage at these positions (Fig. 2 and Table II). The differential effects of the benzofurans on BACE1 and BACE2 activity with respect to peptide versus protein substrates and BACE2 activity with regard to processing distinct sites within Aβ is novel for compounds that inhibit BACE1/2 activity. A potential explanation for the distinctive substrate dependence exhibited by benzofurans 1–4 is that the compounds block cleavage of APP and Aβ by binding to and interfering with the substrate. In this case, the compounds might also block γ-secretase cleavage of substrates containing Aβ. Compounds 1–5 were therefore evaluated for inhibition of γ-secretase cleavage of both CTF99 and a 28-mer peptide encompassing the C-terminal domain of Aβ extending from residues 28 through 55 of CTF99 (Table III and Fig. 3). Compounds 1–3 inhibited γ-secretase cleavage of CTF99 at the X-40 position with IC50 values similar to those observed for inhibition of BACE1 and BACE2 cleavage of APP. (Cleavage of CTF99 at the X-42 position was too low to be detected). Compounds 1–3 also inhibited γ-secretase cleavage of the 28-mer peptide substrate, and the IC50 values obtained in assays using the 28-mer peptide were comparable with those obtained with CTF99. Compound 4 inhibited γ-secretase cleavage of the CTF99 but did not inhibit cleavage of the peptide substrate. Compound 5 did not have an effect on cleavage of CTF99 or the peptide substrate.Table IIIγ-Secretase inhibition with CTF99 or a 28-mer peptide substrateCompoundCTF99 IC5028-mer IC50μmμm1NDaND, not determined.1022911387450>2005>33>100a ND, not determined. Open table in a new tab Compounds 1–3 Bind APP within the Aβ Domain—The benzofurans 1–4 inhibited processing of a variety of related APP substrates by structurally distinct aspartyl proteases. Substrates in which cleavage was affected had in common the C-terminal domain of Aβ. Taken together, the data suggest these compounds may interfere with processing by interacting with the substrates rather than the enzymes, and this interaction is likely mediated through the C-terminal portion of the Aβ domain (Fig. 3). Although we attempted to explore the potential for interaction with APP using a variety of biophysical methods, such as NMR and nitrocellulose filter binding, the limited solubility of these compounds was problematic for many solution-based methods (data not shown). We therefore used surface plasmon resonance to assess binding to APP using the Biacore S51 instrument. Biotinylated APPFL and biotinylated sAPPβ were immobilized onto a streptavidin-coated sensor chip. Compounds 1–3 were analyzed at various concentrations, and the binding response at each concentration was monitored for both proteins. Representative data for binding to APPFL are shown for compound 2 in Fig. 4. For compound 2, binding to APPFL was observed to occur in a dose-dependent manner (Fig. 4A), whereas no interaction was observed between the BACE inhibitor, Statine-Val, and APP (Fig. 4B). Compound 2 did not bind to sAPPβ, consistent with the results from enzyme assays, which suggest binding to APPFL occurs within the Aβ domain (data not shown). Finally, the Kd determined in this analysis (43 μm) was comparable with the IC50 values obtained for this compound for inhibition of APP processing by BACE1 and γ-secretase (9–29 μm) (Fig. 4B). APP binding was also observed with compounds 1 and 3 (data not shown). The Benzofuran Analogs Inhibit CTF99 Cleavage in Cell Culture—Compounds 1–4 were tested in cell culture for their effects on APP processing by BACE1 and γ-secretase (39Shi X-P. Tugusheva K. Bruce J.E. Lucka A. Chen Dodson E. Hu B. Wu G. Price E. Register R.B. Lineberger J. Gates A.T. Miller R. Tang M. Espeseth A. Kahana J. Wolfe A. Crouthamel M. Sankaranarayanan S. Simon A. Chen L.

Although none of the compounds inhibited BACE1 cleavage of APP, all four analogs inhibited γ-secretase cleavage of exogenously expressed CTF99. Interestingly, compounds 2 and 3, similar to a number of NSAIDs, had position-specific effects on γ-secretase cleavage of CTF99 (Fig. 5B). As with the γ-secretase modulators, production of the Aβ X-42 species of amyloid was more sensitive to treatment with the benzofuran compounds than was the Aβ X-40 species (Fig. 5). We have characterized a series of benzofuran analogs that inhibit secretase-mediated APP processing by a novel mechanism. These molecules inhibit BACE1 and BACE2 processing of full-length APP but not β-site peptide substrates. In addition, they inhibit BACE2 processing of Aβ and γ-secretase processing of CTF99 with comparable efficacy. Although BACE1 and γ-secretase are both aspartyl proteases, they do not share structural similarity, and to date, there have been no other reports of compounds that block both β- and γ-secretase-mediated proteolysis in vitro. Inhibition of both BACE1/2 and γ-secretase cleavage, along with the substrate specificity associated with compound activity and the demonstration of binding to APP by surface plasmon resonance, suggest these molecules block APP processing, not by interacting with the processing enzymes, but by binding to the substrate. These results validate a new mechanism to interfere with APP processing and suggest a novel approach to AD therapeutics. These compounds were able to disrupt γ-secretase processing of both APP and CTF99 in vitro, but in cells, they prevented only γ-secretase cleavage of CTF99, an apparent contradiction. The physical properties of the compounds used in this study made it unlikely that they would cross the plasma membrane, so one possible explanation is that γ-secretase cleavage of CTF99 occurs at the plasma membrane, whereas full-length APP is internalized upon interaction with BACE1 and is cleaved by both BACE1 and γ-secretase within the endosome (43Kinoshita A. Fukumoto H. Shah T. Whelan C.M. Irizarry M.C. Hyman B.T. J. Cell Sci. 2003; 116: 3339-3346Crossref PubMed Scopus (226) Google Scholar). γ-Secretase activity at the plasma membrane, including interactions between γ-secretase and CTF99, has been described previously, supporting this assertion (8Chyung J.H.

A. 2004; 101: 17050-17055Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). Although other studies carried out with cell impenetrant γ-secretase inhibitors have suggested that γ-secretase cleavage of Notch occurs at the cell surface, while cleavage of CTF99 occurs in the endosomal compartment; however, differences in cell lines and in expression conditions between these assays and those used in this study may have resulted in differences in CTF99 trafficking that could account for these differences (48Tarassishin L. Yin Y.I. Bassit B. Li Y. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2004; 101: 17050-17055Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). Indirect evidence implicating binding to APP through the C-terminal portion of the Aβ includes the following observations: (i) compounds 1–4 blocked BACE1 and BACE2 cleavage of APP at the β-site but had no effect on the processing of β-site peptide substrates, (ii) the compounds inhibited BACE2 cleavage of Aβ at position 34 but exhibited variable efficacy at the 19/20 site, and finally, (iii) γ-secretase cleavage of a peptide beginning at Aβ position 28 was inhibited. Although these data allow one to infer that binding occurs within the Aβ domain proximal to the C-terminal end, it is interesting to note that these compounds inhibit cleavage of APP by BACE1 and -2 at the N terminus of Aβ. Therefore, although these effects on substrate processing may be the result of direct steric interference, it is also possible that binding may induce conformational changes and prevent processing indirectly. The latter could explain the enhancement of processing by BACE2 observed at specific cleavage sites. Interestingly, structurally distinct benzofuran analogs that dissociate fibrillar Aβ have been described previously (49Howlett D.R. Perry A.E. Godfrey F. Swatton J.E. Jennings K.H. Spitzfaden C. Wadsworth H. Wood S.J. Markwell R.E. Biochem. J. 1999; 340: 283-289Crossref PubMed Scopus (190) Google Scholar, 50Ono M. Kung M.P. Hou C. Kung H.F. Nucl. Med. Biol. 2002; 29: 633-642Crossref PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar), and the benzofuran motif in both series may play a critical role in binding to Aβ. The C terminus of Aβ is known to be involved in aggregation, thus the observation that benzofuran analogs can affect Aβ aggregation is consistent with our results, suggesting that benzofurans 1–4 interact with Aβ within this region. For compound 2, the Kd determined for binding to full-length APP by surface plasmon resonance was similar to the IC50 value obtained for BACE1 and γ-secretase cleavage of APP, as well as BACE2 cleavage of Aβ. Taken together, these results suggest the structure of the Aβ domain may not differ significantly between APP and the processed peptide. Intriguingly, the benzofuran-containing compounds, although inhibiting cleavage at the β-site and at Aβ position 34, also behaved like cleavage modulators. At positions 19 and 20 of Aβ, compound 1 enhanced BACE2 cleavage, although reducing BACE2 cleavage at position 34. In addition, when assayed for their effects on γ-secretase cleavage of CTF99 in cells, compounds 2 and 3 inhibited cleavage at position 42, although having a decreased effect on cleavage at position 40. This differential effect on γ-secretase cleavage of CTF99 in cells is similar to the reported effects of NSAIDs on γ-secretase cleavage of APP, both in mice and in cells. Several mechanisms for the effect of NSAIDs on Aβ secretion have been proposed. The γ-secretase modulatory effects of NSAIDs have been ascribed as an indirect effect because of their inhibition of Rho (51Zhou Y. Su Y. Li B. Liu F. Ryder J.W. Wu X. Gonzalez-DeWhitt P.A.

However, NSAIDs directly block γ-secretase activity in cell extracts and compete with transition state inhibitors for binding to γ-secretase, suggesting a noncompetitive allosteric binding mode (46Beher D.

Therefore, it appears unlikely that the benzofurans described in this manuscript modulate APP cleavage via the same mechanism as the NSAIDs. However, NSAIDs have also been shown to bind Aβ fibrils (44Agdeppa E.D. Kepe V. Petri A. Satyamurthy N. Liu J. Huang S.C. Small G.W. Cole G.M. Barrio J.R. Neuroscience. 2003; 117: 723-730Crossref PubMed Scopus (168) Google Scholar). Although it is possible that an additional mechanism for the γ-secretase modulatory effects of NSAIDs is mediated by the APP CTF, the structure of Aβ fibrils is distinct from the APPFL, CTF99, and soluble Aβ substrates of β- and γ-secretase. Our results demonstrate that compounds that bind APP can inhibit its processing by each of the three different enzymes responsible for its metabolism in vivo. This represents a novel mechanism for inhibition of Aβ generation. Although the higher molar concentration of substrate relative to enzyme suggests that small molecule inhibitors are more effective when directed to the enzyme component of the pathway, given the potential for mechanism-based toxicity associated with γ-secretase inhibitors and the overall difficulties in generating BACE1 inhibitors with in vivo efficacy, targeting APP may provide an alternative approach for AD drug discovery efforts."
https://openalex.org/W2016800270,"Recently, E2F function has expanded to include the regulation of differentiation in human epidermal keratinocytes (HEKs). We extend these findings to report that in HEKs, Sp1 is a differentiation-specific activator and a downstream target of E2F-mediated suppression of the differentiation-specific marker, transglutaminase type 1 (TG-1). Deletion of elements between −0.084 to −0.034 kb of the TG-1 promoter disabled E2F1-induced suppression of promoter activity. Electrophoretic mobility shift assays (EMSAs) demonstrated that Sp1 and Sp3 bound this region. Protein expression analysis suggested that squamous differentiation was accompanied by increased Sp1/Sp3 ratio. Cotransfection of proliferating HEKs or the squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) cell line, KJD-1/SV40, with an E2F inhibitor (E2Fd/n) and Sp1 expression plasmid was sufficient to activate the TG-1 promoter. The suppression of Sp1 activity by E2F in differentiated cells appeared to be indirect since we found no evidence of an Sp1/E2F coassociation on the TG-1 promoter fragment. Moreover, E2F inhibition in the presence of a differentiation stimulus induced Sp1 protein. These data demonstrate that (i) Sp1 can act as a differentiation stimulus, (ii) E2F-mediated suppression of differentiation-specific markers is indirect via Sp1 inhibition and (iii) a combination of E2F inhibition and Sp1 activation could form the basis of a differentiation therapy for SCCs."
https://openalex.org/W2006527633,"The c-Abl and Arg nonreceptor tyrosine kinases are activated in the response of cells to oxidative stress. The present studies demonstrate that treatment of cells with 0.1 mM H2O2 is associated with increased tyrosine phosphorylation of Arg and little effect on Arg levels. By contrast, exposure to 1.0 mM H2O2 decreased Arg phosphorylation. Treatment with 1.0 mM H2O2 was also associated with ubiquitination and degradation of Arg. The results show that Arg is stabilized in response to 0.1 mM H2O2 by autophosphorylation of Y-261, consistent with involvement of the Arg kinase function in regulating Arg levels. The results further demonstrate that c-Abl-mediated phosphorylation of Arg on Y-261 similarly confers Arg stabilization. In concert with these results, phosphorylation of Arg on Y-261 blocked H2O2-induced ubiquitination and thereby Arg degradation and inactivation. These findings demonstrate that Arg phosphorylation and degradation are differentially regulated by the degree of oxidative stress, and that Arg stability is conferred by phosphorylation of Y-261."

There are two recognized pathways to cobalamin (1Roessner C.A. Santander P.J. Scott A.I. Litwack G. Begley T. Vitamins and Hormones. 61. Academic Press, San Diego, CA2001: 267-297Google Scholar), one that requires molecular oxygen (aerobic pathway) and one that does not (anaerobic pathway). The intermediates of the aerobic route, from aminolevulinic acid (ALA) 1The abbreviations used are: ALA, 5-aminolevulinic acid; cobester, cobyrinic acid heptamethylester. to adenosylcobalamin in Pseudomonas denitrificans, have all been biosynthesized and their structures determined (1Roessner C.A.

In addition, the role of cobalt in early intermediates of the anaerobic pathway and its importance in the mechanism of ring contraction in the absence of oxygen were established (3Santander P.J. Roessner C.A. Stolowich N.J. Holderman M.T. Scott A.I. Chem. Biol. 1997; 4: 659-666Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar) in a cell-free system. In this system, precorrin 3 was produced from uroporphyrinogen III and then converted to cobalt-precorrin 4 (Fig. 1) by non-enzymatic cobalt chelation and C-17 methylation (with the concomitant ring contraction) by CbiH of Salmonella enterica serovar typhimurium LT2. However, the in vitro synthesis of those intermediates of the anaerobic pathway, which have been proposed to lie between cobalt-precorrin 4 and cobyrinic acid (Fig. 1), has proved difficult, and most of their structures remain unknown. Furthermore, the enzymes CbiD and CbiG, which are found in almost all organisms that utilize the anaerobic pathway and were shown previously to be essential for adenosyl-cobyric acid biosynthesis (4Raux E. Lanois A. Levillayer F. Warren M.J. Brody E. Rambach A. Thermes C. J. Bacteriol. 1996; 178: 753-767Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar, 5Raux E. Lanois A. Rambach A. Warren M.J. Thermes C. Biochem. J. 1998; 335: 167-173Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar), have not been functionally characterized. Although CbiG shows some similarity to the P. denitrificans CobE protein (function not known), CbiD has no known counterpart in the aerobic pathway. Because it has a potential S-adenosyl-l-methionine binding site (6Warren M.J. Raux E. Schubert H. Escalante-Semerena J.C. Nat. Prod. Rep. 2002; 19: 390-412Crossref PubMed Scopus (330) Google Scholar), CbiD was suggested previously to be the C-1 methyltransferase (7Roper J.M. Raux E. Brindley A.A. Schubert H.L. Gharbia S.E. Shah H.N. Warren M.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 40316-40323Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar), but no experimental data have yet been provided to support this proposal. In the aerobic pathway, the C-1 methyltransferase is encoded by the cobF gene (8Debussche L. Thibaut D. Cameron B. Crouzet J. Blanche F. J. Bacteriol. 1993; 175: 7430-7440Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), but an analog of cobF has been reported in only one of the organisms that utilize the anaerobic pathway to cobalamin. The recent sequence of the Propionibacterium acnes genome (9Bruggemann H. Henne A. Hoster F. Liesegang H. Wiezer A. Strittmatter A. Hujer S. Durre P. Gottschalk G. Science. 2004; 305: 671-673Crossref PubMed Scopus (360) Google Scholar) revealed the presence of proteins similar to CobF and CbiG but none that showed homology to CbiD, suggesting that CobF takes the place of CbiD in this organism. To provide an experimental system for analysis of the function of CbiD, we engineered new strains of Escherichia coli that bear cobalamin biosynthetic genes from the anaerobic pathway of S. enterica. One of these strains produced cobyrinic acid a,c-diamide, whereas other strains produced related compounds. These compounds, however, lacked the C-1 methyl group, a phenomenon not observed previously in cobalamin biosynthesis but one that provides the first evidence that CbiD is involved in C-1 methylation during the biosynthesis of this cofactor.

The combined cell pellets from 4 liters of LB were resuspended in 1 liter of minimal medium, which consisted of M9 salts containing the same antibiotics plus the following additives: 0.2% glycerol, 0.2% l(+)-arabinose, 0.01% yeast extract, 2 mm MgCl2, 0.1 mm CaCl2, 20 mg of CoCl2 ♦6H2O, 20 mg of ALA, and (for strains containing pZS*24-based plasmids) 0.2 mm isopropyl-β-d-thiogalactopyranoside. Products for 13C NMR analysis were prepared by adding either 10–20 mg of [13C×ALA instead of unlabeled ALA to label the ring or 50 mg of [13C]methionine to label the S-adenosyl-l-methionine-derived methyl groups. The cells in minimal medium were incubated with aeration at 37 °C for 24 h and without aeration at 25 °C for 24 h, collected by centrifugation, resuspended in 100 ml of 50 mm Tris-HCl, and lysed by sonication. The porphyrinoids found in both the culture medium and in the cell lysate were isolated by binding them to DEAE-Sephadex followed by esterification in methanol:sulfuric acid (95:5) and separation by thin layer chromatography on silica plates (3Santander P.J. Roessner C.A. Stolowich N.J. Holderman M.T. Scott A.I. Chem. Biol. 1997; 4: 659-666Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). Solid KCN was added to the product and to the solvent (dichloromethane:methanol, 95:5) prior to TLC. The isolation procedure resulted in purification of the products in the cyano-methylester form, which were extracted from the silica gel with the TLC solvent and quantitated using ϵ368 = 3.04 × 104m–1 cm–1. Spectral Analyses—UV-visible spectra were obtained with an Ocean Optics USB2000 miniature fiber optic spectrometer. 13C NMR spectra were acquired on a Bruker ARX 500 spectrometer at 125 MHz using a 5-mm C/H probe with a 1-s relaxation delay, a 30° pulse, accumulation of 40,000 scans, and Fourier transformation with 1-Hz line broadening. The samples were dissolved in KCN-saturated C6D6, and the benzene central line (128 ppm) was used for calibration. Mass spectral analyses were provided by the Laboratory for Biological Mass Spectrometry (Chemistry Department, Texas A&M University). Production of 1-Desmethylcobyrinic Acid in E. coli—The first product analyzed was isolated from strain CR681, which was constructed to contain all of the genes believed to be necessary to convert uroporphyrinogen III to cobyrinic acid (Fig. 1, the enzymes that convert ALA to uroporphyrinogen III are provided by the host). The esterified product isolated from CR681 was similar to cobyrinic acid heptamethylester (cobester) based on Rf (see TLCs in the supplemental material), UV-visible spectroscopy (Fig. 2), and 13C NMR spectrometry of the product derived from 13C-enriched ALA (Table II and the NMR spectra in the supplemental material). However, the chemical shifts of some of the ring carbons differed significantly from those expected for cobester, especially that of C-19 (a 3.4-ppm difference). In addition, the mass of the product was 14 daltons less than that expected for cobester, which could be accounted for by loss of a methyl group. When the cells were grown on [13C]methionine to label the methyl groups, the chemical shifts of the six labeled methyl groups did not correspond to the seven S-adenosyl-l-methionine-derived methyl groups of cobester reported for cobester; especially conspicuous was the lack of the downfield signal at around 22.4 ppm corresponding to the C-1 methyl group. Further NMR analyses (see DEPT90, two-dimensional heteronuclear single quantum correlation proton-carbon correlation, and heteronuclear multiple band correlation spectra in the supplemental material) showed beyond a doubt that C-1 of the CR681 product was protonated rather than methylated, proving that the isolated product was, indeed, 1-desmethylcobester (Fig. 3).Table IINMR, mass, and Rf characterization of the esterified products isolated from engineered strainsNMR analysis of the CR681, CR701, and CR727 productsChemical shiftLiterature valueCarbon assignmentCR681CR701CR727CobesteraDerived by methanolysis of vitamin B12 (20).83.383.383.382.81bDerived from 4-13C-ALA-labeled product.56.356.357.757.23bDerived from 4-13C-ALA-labeled product.176.7176.7ND175.64cDerived from 5-13C-ALA-labeled product.103.8103.8ND104.25cDerived from 5-13C-ALA-labeled product.163.3163.3162.2164.16bDerived from 4-13C-ALA-labeled product.54.454.457.354.68bDerived from 4-13C-ALA-labeled product.172.1172.0ND172.29cDerived from 5-13C-ALA-labeled product.91.191.1ND91.510cDerived from 5-13C-ALA-labeled product.176.7176.8176.1176.811bDerived from 4-13C-ALA-labeled product.53.553.554.054.013bDerived from 4-13C-ALA-labeled product.163.5163.5ND163.814cDerived from 5-13C-ALA-labeled product.102.7102.5ND102.215cDerived from 5-13C-ALA-labeled product.175.9175.4ND175.916cDerived from 5-13C-ALA-labeled product.59.359.358.658.617bDerived from 4-13C-ALA-labeled product.71.971.975.275.319bDerived from 4-13C-ALA-labeled product.NDgND, not determined.22.222.4C-1-MedDerived from 13C-methionine-labeled product.18.6ND17.016.9C-2-MedDerived from 13C-methionine-labeled product.15.5ND15.815.9C-5-MedDerived from 13C-methionine-labeled product.19.0ND19.419.3C-7-MedDerived from 13C-methionine-labeled product.19.4ND19.519.6C-12α-MedDerived from 13C-methionine-labeled product.15.3ND15.515.6C-15-MedDerived from 13C-methionine-labeled product.18.7ND18.218.2C-17-MedDerived from 13C-methionine-labeled product.Mass and Rf analyses of the CR681, CR701, CR716, CR718, CR727, and CR728 productsRfeCH2Cl2:CH3OH (95:5).Observed mass (ESI+)CobesteraDerived by methanolysis of vitamin B12 (20).1062.43 (monocyanocobester)0.5CR681 and CR701 productsfMasses were derived from unlabeled products.1048.43 (monocyano-1-desmethylcobester)0.5CR716 and CR718 products1018.43 (monocyano-1-desmethylcobester a,c-diamide)0.1CR727 product1032.43 (monocyanocobester a,c-diamide)0.1CR728 product1018.43 (monocyano-1-desmethylcobester a,c-diamide)0.1a Derived by methanolysis of vitamin B12 (20Battersby A.R.

No corrinoid products could be isolated from the cbiG deletion mutant (see TLC in the supplemental material). Evidence that the truncated CbiG/CbiH fusion protein still had CbiH activity and that no polar effects were created by deletion of the BstBI fragment was provided by transforming a third plasmid, pCAR698, which bears a complete cbiG gene, into CR694. Cobyrinic acid synthesis in this strain, CR699, was rescued by complementation of the mutant cbiG gene by pGEC4 (see TLC in the supplemental material). CbiD Is Not Necessary for 1-Demethyl Cobyrinic Acid Biosynthesis—A cbiD– strain (CR701) was constructed by removing a 1060-base pair SnaBI-SalI fragment from the plasmid bearing the cbiC-J genes, which resulted in the loss of 93% of the 379-amino acid CbiD protein. This strain, otherwise identical to CR681, also produced 1-desmethylcobyrinic acid based on UV-visible, NMR, and mass analyses (Fig. 2, Table II), suggesting that CbiD is necessary for C-1 methylation. Production of 1-Desmethylcobyrinic Acid a,c-Diamide— Based on the homology of CbiA with CobB of the aerobic pathway, CbiA is the enzyme that amidates the a and c side chains of cobyrinic acid to afford cob(II)yrinic acid a,c-diamide, which is then reduced to cob(I)yrinic a,c-diamide and adenosylated to yield adenosyl-cobyrinic acid a,c-diamide (Fig. 1). Thus, the cbiA gene was inserted into pZS*24 and the plasmid transformed into strains CR681 and CR701 to afford CR716 and CR718. An identical product was isolated from both strains with Rf and mass values (Table II and TLC in supplemental material) lower than those of the CR681 and CR701 product and consistent with the bisamidation of 1-desmethylcobyrinic acid. Although the amidation sites have not been confirmed, the assumption is made that the a and c side chains of the product are amidated, thus affording 1-desmethylcobyrinic acid a,c-diamide. Production of Cobyrinic Acid a,c-Diamide—Based on its homology with CobQ of the aerobic pathway, CbiP is proposed to be the enzyme that amidates the b, d, e, and g side chains of adenosyl-cobyrinic acid a,c-diamide to afford adenosyl-cobyric acid (Fig. 1). In addition, previous reports (4Raux E. Lanois A. Levillayer F. Warren M.J. Brody E. Rambach A. Thermes C. J. Bacteriol. 1996; 178: 753-767Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar, 5Raux E.

To test whether our engineered E. coli strain could further process 1-demethyl cobyrinic acid a,c-diamide, the cbiP gene was introduced into the plasmid bearing cbiA and transformed into CR681 and CR701 to afford strains CR727 and CR728. Two products that bound to DEAE-Sephadex were isolated from CR727 (see TLC in the supplemental material). The mass and 13C NMR spectrum (derived from 13C-4 ALA) of the product in the lower band extracted from the TLC plate corresponded to 1-desmethylcobester a,c-diamide, and, surprisingly, the mass and 13C NMR spectra (derived from 13C-4 ALA and [13C×methionine, Table II) of the product in the upper band corresponded to cobester a,c-diamide. The presence of the C-1 methyl group in this product has been confirmed by two-dimensional NMR analyses (see NMR spectra in the supplemental material). On the other hand, the mass and the methyl group NMR spectrum of the product isolated from CR728 (identical to CR727 except cbiD–) correspond to that of 1-desmethylcobester a,c-diamide, and a strain (CR735) in which only the cbiP gene was transformed into CR681 produced 1-demethyl cobyrinic acid. The product isolated from each strain described in this paper is summarized in Table III.Table IIIProducts isolated from genetically engineered strains of E. coliStrainGenesProduct isolatedCR681cobAKL, cbiCDETFGHJ1-DesmethylcobesterCR694cobAKL, cbiCDETFHJ, (ΔcbiG)No corrinoid productCR699cobAKL, cbiCDETFHJ, (ΔcbiG)(+cbiG)1-DesmethylcobesterCR701cobAKL, cbiCETFGHJ, (ΔcbiD)1-DesmethylcobesterCR716cobAKL, cbiCDETFGHJ, cbiA1-Desmethylcobester a,c-diamideCR718cobAKL, cbiCETFGHJ, cbiA1-Desmethylcobester a,c-diamideCR727cobAKL, cbiCDETFGHJ, cbiAPCobester a,c-diamide (75%)1-Desmethylcobester a,c-diamide (25%)CR728cobAKL, cbiCETFGHJ, cbiAP1-Desmethylcobester a,c-diamideCR735cobAKL, cbiCDETFGHJ, cbiP1-Desmethyl cobester Open table in a new tab We have described several genetically engineered strains of E. coli that synthesize corrinoid products. One strain, CR727, synthesizes cobyrinic acid a,c-diamide, whereas another strain, CR728, which differs only in the lack of the cbiD gene, synthesizes 1-desmethylcobyrinic acid a,c-diamide. This result alone provides solid evidence that CbiD is either itself the C-1 methyltransferase or performs some role prerequisite to C-1 methylation. A paradox exists, however, in that the products isolated from other strains that do have the cbiD gene are also unmethylated at the C-1 position. These strains have either no additional genes (CR681) or one of the two amidases cbiA or cbiP (CR716 and CR735, respectively). It is possible that in these strains, cbiD is the only gene not expressed from the large plasmid or that CbiD, when overexpressed, is not folded correctly or is insoluble. Varying the growth conditions (lower temperatures, no aeration) had no effect on the CR681 product (not shown). To express cbiD separately from the other genes in the large plasmid (and because enzymes from different sources are sometimes more soluble), the cbiD genes from not only S. enterica but also Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Methanocaldococcus jannaschii were ligated into pZS*24, and the resultant plasmids were transformed into strain CR681. The three resultant strains all still produced 1-desmethylcobyrinic acid (not shown). Because neither CbiA nor CbiP alone is sufficient for CbiD activity (strains CR716 and CR735), it appears that CbiD, even though it may be produced, is not active unless both CbiA and CbiP are present. It could be that these two proteins act as a chaperone for the proper folding of CbiD or that the three enzymes (perhaps along with other enzymes of the pathway) form a complex, and CbiD is active only when part of this trimer. Another possibility is that as more genes are added into the overexpression system, the overall level of each gene product is reduced. This possibility is reflected in the decreased amount of product that can be isolated from the strains as the number of genes increases (see the TLCs in the supplemental material). If CbiD is soluble only when produced under a certain critical concentration and insoluble above that concentration, then it may be soluble only in strain CR727, which bears the most genes and makes the least product. There is also a conundrum with strain CR727 in that there is no evidence for amidation beyond the formation of cobyrinic acid a,c-diamide even though the strain contains cbiP, the gene for the second amidase. In the aerobic pathway, it has been shown that the substrate for the second amidase (CobQ) is adenosyl-cobyrinic acid a,c-diamide (12Blanche F. Couder M. Debussche L. Thibaut D. Cameron B. Crouzet J. J. Bacteriol. 1991; 173: 6046-6051Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Although E. coli K-12 does have BtuR, an endogenous corrinoid:ATP adenosyltransferase (13Lundrigan M.D. Kadner R.J. J. Bacteriol. 1989; 171: 154-161Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), which could serve to adenosylate cobyrinic acid a,c-diamide, it is possible that either the growth conditions or lack of the needed enzymes and/or cofactors prevent the cobalt reduction that is necessary for adenosylation. Perhaps the most intriguing outcome of this study is that the pathway was able to advance as far as the bisamidated intermediate in the absence of C-1 methylation. Because the order of methylations in the anaerobic pathway has been shown to be as it is depicted in Fig. 1 (21Scott A.I. Mackenzie N.E. Santander P.J. Fagerness P.E. Muller G. Schneider E. Sedlmeier R. Worner G. Bioorg. Chem. 1984; 12: 356-360Crossref Scopus (35) Google Scholar), the substrate specificity of the enzymes ensuing C-1 methylation must be relaxed enough to accept the unmethylated substrates. It is of considerable evolutionary interest to speculate whether the 1-demethyl pathway could be extended to the cobalamin cofactors and, indeed, whether the 1-demethyl cofactors would function in the reactions of the enzymes where they were used.

https://openalex.org/W2032102284,"The G-protein α subunit, α13, regulates cell growth and differentiation through the monomeric Rho GTPase. α13 activates Rho through direct stimulation of the guanine nucleotide exchange factor p115RhoGEF, which contains a regulator of G-protein signaling homology domain (RH) in its N-terminus. Through its RH domain, p115RhoGEF also functions as a GAP for Gα13. The mechanism for the Gα13/p115RhoGEF interaction is not well understood. Here, we determined specific α13 residues important for its interaction with p115RhoGEF. GST-pulldowns and co-immunoprecipitation assays revealed that individually mutating α13 residues Lys204, Glu229, or Arg232 to opposite charge residues disrupts the interaction of activated α13 with the RH domain of p115RhoGEF or full-length p115RhoGEF. We further demonstrate that mutation of Glu229, and to a lesser extent Lys204 or Arg232, disrupts the ability of activated α13 to induce the recruitment of p115RhoGEF to the plasma membrane (PM) and to activate Rho-mediated serum response element-luciferase gene transcription. Interestingly, an α13 mutant where a conserved Gly was mutated to a Ser (G205S) retained its ability to bind to p115RhoGEF, induce p115RhoGEF recruitment to the PM, and activate Rho-dependent signaling, even though identical Gly to Ser mutations in other α disrupt their interaction with regulator of G-protein signaling (RGS) proteins. These results demonstrate that, whereas several features of a typical α/RGS interaction are preserved in the α13/p115RhoGEF interaction, there are also significant differences."
