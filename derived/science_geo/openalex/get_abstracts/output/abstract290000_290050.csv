https://openalex.org/W2049117296,"Molecular dynamics simulations of atomically thin, fluid films confined between two solid plates are described. For a broad range of parameters, a generic stick-slip motion is observed, consistent with the results of recent boundary lubrication experiments. Static plates induce crystalline order in the film. Stick-slip motion involves periodic shear-melting transitions and recrystllization of the film. Uniform motion occurs at high velocities where the film no longer has time to order. These results indicate that the origin of stick-slip motion is thermodynamic instability of the sliding state, rather than a dynamic instability as usually assumed."
https://openalex.org/W2075436552,"The concentrations of H(+), SO(4)(2-), and NO(3)(-) in the precipitation of eastern North America are greater now than they were historically as a result of fossil-fuel combustion. Because of a lack of data prior to 1950, the absolute increases in the concentrations of these three ions are unknown. This problem can be addressed by comparing the composition of precipitation from areas sensitive to acidic deposition with that of precipitation from remote areas. An analysis of precipitation data indicates that many areas of eastern North America receive precipitation with substantially greater H(+), SO(4)(2-), and NO(3)(-) concentrations than remote areas. For example, SO(4)(2-), the most ecologically significant indicator of change, is enriched 2 to 16 times in eastern North American precipitation relative to its concentration in remote areas."
https://openalex.org/W2044490939,"The character of sedimentary basins, before they are deformed and metamorphosed, may strongly influence the thermal and baric patterns of metamorphic belts. Crustal thickening of anoxic sedimentary basins and subsequent thermal reequilibration may produce large areas of high-grade metamorphic rocks and granites because the concentrations of the heat-producing elements are high in such basins. In New England there is a spatial association among granites and high-grade metasedimentary rocks rich in U and Th that now form the Central Maine terrane. The high content of heat-producing elements in these rocks is attributed to fixing of U and Th in highly reduced sediments that were deposited in an anoxic basin that formed in the Silurian. When the basin was thickened during the Devonian Acadian orogeny, the thermal energy generated by the U- and Th-rich sediments produced the observed broad zone of high-grade rocks and anatectic granites. This hypothesis was tested with thermal calculations that reproduce most of the first-order thermal and baric patterns of the Acadian Appalachians, if pretectonic lateral variations in heat production are assumed."

https://openalex.org/W2093970541,"Phosphatidylinositol has been identified as a major component of the ice nucleating site on the outer surface of two bacteria, Pseudomonas syringae and Erwinia herbicola. Plant lectins binding to inositol and a highly purified phosphatidylinositol-specific hydrolase (a C(II) lipase) inhibited or decreased the efficiency of the ice nucleating activity (INA) of both bacteria. Extracts of these two INA(+) bacteria had phosphatidylinositol synthase activity while extracts from related INA(-) Pseudomonas or Erwinia strains had no detectable synthase activity. An Escherichia coli strain acquired phosphatidylinositol synthase activity when transformed to the INA(+) phenotype with recombinant plasmids containing fragments of P. syringae DNA."
https://openalex.org/W2036238947,"The status of experimental tests of general relativity is reviewed on the occasion of its 75th anniversary. Einstein's equivalence principle is well supported by experiments such as the Eötvös experiment, tests of special relativity, and the gravitational redshift experiment. Tests of general relativity have reached high precision, including the light deflection and the perihelion advance of Mercury, proposed by Einstein 75 years ago, and new tests such as the Shapiro time delay and the Nordtvedt effect in lunar motion. Gravitational wave damping has been detected to an accuracy of 1 percent on the basis of measurements of the binary pulsar. The status of the ""fifth force"" is discussed, along with the frontiers of experimental relativity, including proposals for testing relativistic gravity with advanced technology and spacecraft."
https://openalex.org/W2147401192,"The presence of magnetic anomaly 3, age 5 million years, beneath the continental slope off northernmost California, is evidence for underthrusting of the continental margin during the late Cenozoic. Folded and faulted strata near the base of the slope attest to deformation of the eastern edge of the turbidite sedimzents in the Gorda Basin; the deformation observed is exactly that expected from underthrusting. The relative motions of three crustal plates also suggest underthrusting, possibly with a major component of right-lateral slip."
https://openalex.org/W1981832116,"Geological, geomorphological, and archeological data of changes in sea level during the Holocene at the Mediterranean coast of Dor provide a eustatic curve of the region. This curve shows that sea level was approximately 2 meters below the present level 4000 years ago, rose to 1 meter below the present level 3000 years ago, and was 1 meter higher than the present level 1500 years ago. It then dropped to 1 meter below the present level about 800 years ago."
https://openalex.org/W2026638854,"The concentrations of beryllium-7, sodium-22, aluminum-26, potassium-40, scandium-46, vanadium-48, chromium-51, manganese-54, cobalt-57, cobalt-60, and thorium-232 (thallium-208) have been measured in the Allende meteorite by nondestructive gamma-ray spectrometry. The high cobalt-60 content of the meteorite is indicative of a preatmospheric body with a minimum effective radius of 50 centimeters and a weight of 1650 kilograms; the aluminum-26 activity indicates a minimum exposure age of 3 million years."
https://openalex.org/W1972285625,The magnetic anomaly usually associated with the Olduvai geomagnetic event (1.96 million years) should probably be associated with the Gilsa event (~ 1.65 million years). The Oldu-vai event can be correlated with a con-sistently appearing minor anomalycalled W. This reassignment gives near-ly uniform spreading rates for sections of the mid-ocean ridge system consid-ere( l here.
