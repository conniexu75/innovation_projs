https://openalex.org/W3179857518,"Ageing is characterized by a progressive loss of physiological integrity, leading to impaired function and increased vulnerability to death1. Despite rapid advances over recent years, many of the molecular and cellular processes that underlie the progressive loss of healthy physiology are poorly understood2. To gain a better insight into these processes, here we generate a single-cell transcriptomic atlas across the lifespan of Mus musculus that includes data from 23 tissues and organs. We found cell-specific changes occurring across multiple cell types and organs, as well as age-related changes in the cellular composition of different organs. Using single-cell transcriptomic data, we assessed cell-type-specific manifestations of different hallmarks of ageing—such as senescence3, genomic instability4 and changes in the immune system2. This transcriptomic atlas—which we denote Tabula Muris Senis, or ‘Mouse Ageing Cell Atlas’—provides molecular information about how the most important hallmarks of ageing are reflected in a broad range of tissues and cell types."
https://openalex.org/W3042406747,"Ageing is the single greatest cause of disease and death worldwide, and understanding the associated processes could vastly improve quality of life. Although major categories of ageing damage have been identified-such as altered intercellular communication, loss of proteostasis and eroded mitochondrial function1-these deleterious processes interact with extraordinary complexity within and between organs, and a comprehensive, whole-organism analysis of ageing dynamics has been lacking. Here we performed bulk RNA sequencing of 17 organs and plasma proteomics at 10 ages across the lifespan of Mus musculus, and integrated these findings with data from the accompanying Tabula Muris Senis2-or 'Mouse Ageing Cell Atlas'-which follows on from the original Tabula Muris3. We reveal linear and nonlinear shifts in gene expression during ageing, with the associated genes clustered in consistent trajectory groups with coherent biological functions-including extracellular matrix regulation, unfolded protein binding, mitochondrial function, and inflammatory and immune response. Notably, these gene sets show similar expression across tissues, differing only in the amplitude and the age of onset of expression. Widespread activation of immune cells is especially pronounced, and is first detectable in white adipose depots during middle age. Single-cell RNA sequencing confirms the accumulation of T cells and B cells in adipose tissue-including plasma cells that express immunoglobulin J-which also accrue concurrently across diverse organs. Finally, we show how gene expression shifts in distinct tissues are highly correlated with corresponding protein levels in plasma, thus potentially contributing to the ageing of the systemic circulation. Together, these data demonstrate a similar yet asynchronous inter- and intra-organ progression of ageing, providing a foundation from which to track systemic sources of declining health at old age."

https://openalex.org/W3099814693,"Magic-angle twisted bilayer graphene (TBG), with rotational misalignment close to 1.1$^\circ$, features isolated flat electronic bands that host a rich phase diagram of correlated insulating, superconducting, ferromagnetic, and topological phases. The origins of the correlated insulators and superconductivity, and the interplay between them, are particularly elusive. Both states have been previously observed only for angles within $\pm0.1^\circ$ from the magic-angle value and occur in adjacent or overlapping electron density ranges; nevertheless, it is still unclear how the two states are related. Beyond the twist angle and strain, the dependence of the TBG phase diagram on the alignment and thickness of insulating hexagonal boron nitride (hBN) used to encapsulate the graphene sheets indicates the importance of the microscopic dielectric environment. Here we show that adding an insulating tungsten-diselenide (WSe$_2$) monolayer between hBN and TBG stabilizes superconductivity at twist angles much smaller than the established magic-angle value. For the smallest angle of $\theta$ = 0.79$^\circ$, we still observe clear superconducting signatures, despite the complete absence of the correlated insulating states and vanishing gaps between the dispersive and flat bands. These observations demonstrate that, even though electron correlations may be important, superconductivity in TBG can exist even when TBG exhibits metallic behaviour across the whole range of electron density. Finite-magnetic-field measurements further reveal breaking of the four-fold spin-valley symmetry in the system, consistent with large spin-orbit coupling induced in TBG via proximity to WSe$_2$. Our results highlight the importance of symmetry breaking effects in stabilizing electronic states in TBG and open new avenues for engineering quantum phases in moir\'e systems."
https://openalex.org/W3042484529,"Approximately 75% of all breast cancers express the oestrogen and/or progesterone receptors. Endocrine therapy is usually effective in these hormone-receptor-positive tumours, but primary and acquired resistance limits its long-term benefit1,2. Here we show that in mouse models of hormone-receptor-positive breast cancer, periodic fasting or a fasting-mimicking diet3-5 enhances the activity of the endocrine therapeutics tamoxifen and fulvestrant by lowering circulating IGF1, insulin and leptin and by inhibiting AKT-mTOR signalling via upregulation of EGR1 and PTEN. When fulvestrant is combined with palbociclib (a cyclin-dependent kinase 4/6 inhibitor), adding periodic cycles of a fasting-mimicking diet promotes long-lasting tumour regression and reverts acquired resistance to drug treatment. Moreover, both fasting and a fasting-mimicking diet prevent tamoxifen-induced endometrial hyperplasia. In patients with hormone-receptor-positive breast cancer receiving oestrogen therapy, cycles of a fasting-mimicking diet cause metabolic changes analogous to those observed in mice, including reduced levels of insulin, leptin and IGF1, with the last two remaining low for extended periods. In mice, these long-lasting effects are associated with long-term anti-cancer activity. These results support further clinical studies of a fasting-mimicking diet as an adjuvant to oestrogen therapy in hormone-receptor-positive breast cancer."
https://openalex.org/W3042952686,"Mechanical interlocking of molecules (catenation) is a nontrivial challenge in modern synthetic chemistry and materials science1,2. One strategy to achieve catenation is the design of pre-annular molecules that are capable of both efficient cyclization and of pre-organizing another precursor to engage in subsequent interlocking3–9. This task is particularly difficult when the annular target is composed of a large ensemble of molecules, that is, when it is a supramolecular assembly. However, the construction of such unprecedented assemblies would enable the visualization of nontrivial nanotopologies through microscopy techniques, which would not only satisfy academic curiosity but also pave the way to the development of materials with nanotopology-derived properties. Here we report the synthesis of such a nanotopology using fibrous supramolecular assemblies with intrinsic curvature. Using a solvent-mixing strategy, we kinetically organized a molecule that can elongate into toroids with a radius of about 13 nanometres. Atomic force microscopy on the resulting nanoscale toroids revealed a high percentage of catenation, which is sufficient to yield ‘nanolympiadane’10, a nanoscale catenane composed of five interlocked toroids. Spectroscopic and theoretical studies suggested that this unusually high degree of catenation stems from the secondary nucleation of the precursor molecules around the toroids. By modifying the self-assembly protocol to promote ring closure and secondary nucleation, a maximum catenation number of 22 was confirmed by atomic force microscopy. Nanoscale toroids with a high percentage of poly-catenation and radii of up to about 13 nm are kinetically organized using fibrous supramolecular assemblies with intrinsic curvature and a solvent-mixing strategy."
https://openalex.org/W3103920613,"Versatile interfaces with strong and tunable light–matter interactions are essential for quantum science1 because they enable mapping of quantum properties between light and matter1. Recent studies2–10 have proposed a method of controlling light–matter interactions using the rich interplay of photon-mediated dipole–dipole interactions in structured subwavelength arrays of quantum emitters. However, a key aspect of this approach—the cooperative enhancement of the light–matter coupling strength and the directional mirror reflection of the incoming light using an array of quantum emitters—has not yet been experimentally demonstrated. Here we report the direct observation of the cooperative subradiant response of a two-dimensional square array of atoms in an optical lattice. We observe a spectral narrowing of the collective atomic response well below the quantum-limited decay of individual atoms into free space. Through spatially resolved spectroscopic measurements, we show that the array acts as an efficient mirror formed by a single monolayer of a few hundred atoms. By tuning the atom density in the array and changing the ordering of the particles, we are able to control the cooperative response of the array and elucidate the effect of the interplay of spatial order and dipolar interactions on the collective properties of the ensemble. Bloch oscillations of the atoms outside the array enable us to dynamically control the reflectivity of the atomic mirror. Our work demonstrates efficient optical metamaterial engineering based on structured ensembles of atoms4,8,9 and paves the way towards controlling many-body physics with light5,6,11 and light–matter interfaces at the single-quantum level7,10. A single two-dimensional array of atoms trapped in an optical lattice shows a tunable cooperative subradiant optical response, acting as a single-monolayer optical mirror with controllable reflectivity."
https://openalex.org/W3042812654,"Manganese is one of the most abundant elements on Earth. The oxidation of manganese has long been theorized1-yet has not been demonstrated2-4-to fuel the growth of chemolithoautotrophic microorganisms. Here we refine an enrichment culture that exhibits exponential growth dependent on Mn(II) oxidation to a co-culture of two microbial species. Oxidation required viable bacteria at permissive temperatures, which resulted in the generation of small nodules of manganese oxide with which the cells associated. The majority member of the culture-which we designate 'Candidatus Manganitrophus noduliformans'-is affiliated to the phylum Nitrospirae (also known as Nitrospirota), but is distantly related to known species of Nitrospira and Leptospirillum. We isolated the minority member, a betaproteobacterium that does not oxidize Mn(II) alone, and designate it Ramlibacter lithotrophicus. Stable-isotope probing revealed 13CO2 fixation into cellular biomass that was dependent upon Mn(II) oxidation. Transcriptomic analysis revealed candidate pathways for coupling extracellular manganese oxidation to aerobic energy conservation and autotrophic CO2 fixation. These findings expand the known diversity of inorganic metabolisms that support life, and complete a biogeochemical energy cycle for manganese5,6 that may interface with other major global elemental cycles."
https://openalex.org/W3043399522,"Bone marrow transplantation therapy relies on the life-long regenerative capacity of haematopoietic stem cells (HSCs)1,2. HSCs present a complex variety of regenerative behaviours at the clonal level, but the mechanisms underlying this diversity are still undetermined3-11. Recent advances in single-cell RNA sequencing have revealed transcriptional differences among HSCs, providing a possible explanation for their functional heterogeneity12-17. However, the destructive nature of sequencing assays prevents simultaneous observation of stem cell state and function. To solve this challenge, we implemented expressible lentiviral barcoding, which enabled simultaneous analysis of lineages and transcriptomes from single adult HSCs and their clonal trajectories during long-term bone marrow reconstitution. Analysis of differential gene expression between clones with distinct behaviour revealed an intrinsic molecular signature that characterizes functional long-term repopulating HSCs. Probing this signature through in vivo CRISPR screening, we found the transcription factor TCF15 to be required and sufficient to drive HSC quiescence and long-term self-renewal. In situ, Tcf15 expression labels the most primitive subset of true multipotent HSCs. In conclusion, our work elucidates clone-intrinsic molecular programmes associated with functional stem cell heterogeneity and identifies a mechanism for the maintenance of the self-renewing HSC state."
https://openalex.org/W3043338671,"The rate of cell growth is crucial for bacterial fitness and drives the allocation of bacterial resources, affecting, for example, the expression levels of proteins dedicated to metabolism and biosynthesis1,2. It is unclear, however, what ultimately determines growth rates in different environmental conditions. Moreover, increasing evidence suggests that other objectives are also important3–7, such as the rate of physiological adaptation to changing environments8,9. A common challenge for cells is that these objectives cannot be independently optimized, and maximizing one often reduces another. Many such trade-offs have indeed been hypothesized on the basis of qualitative correlative studies8–11. Here we report a trade-off between steady-state growth rate and physiological adaptability in Escherichia coli, observed when a growing culture is abruptly shifted from a preferred carbon source such as glucose to fermentation products such as acetate. These metabolic transitions, common for enteric bacteria, are often accompanied by multi-hour lags before growth resumes. Metabolomic analysis reveals that long lags result from the depletion of key metabolites that follows the sudden reversal in the central carbon flux owing to the imposed nutrient shifts. A model of sequential flux limitation not only explains the observed trade-off between growth and adaptability, but also allows quantitative predictions regarding the universal occurrence of such tradeoffs, based on the opposing enzyme requirements of glycolysis versus gluconeogenesis. We validate these predictions experimentally for many different nutrient shifts in E. coli, as well as for other respiro-fermentative microorganisms, including Bacillus subtilis and Saccharomyces cerevisiae. A model of sequential flux bottlenecks explains a universal trade-off between steady-state growth and physiological adaptation time in bacteria exposed to fluctuating growth conditions."
https://openalex.org/W3043231606,"Proteins are manufactured by ribosomes-macromolecular complexes of protein and RNA molecules that are assembled within major nuclear compartments called nucleoli1,2. Existing models suggest that RNA polymerases I and III (Pol I and Pol III) are the only enzymes that directly mediate the expression of the ribosomal RNA (rRNA) components of ribosomes. Here we show, however, that RNA polymerase II (Pol II) inside human nucleoli operates near genes encoding rRNAs to drive their expression. Pol II, assisted by the neurodegeneration-associated enzyme senataxin, generates a shield comprising triplex nucleic acid structures known as R-loops at intergenic spacers flanking nucleolar rRNA genes. The shield prevents Pol I from producing sense intergenic noncoding RNAs (sincRNAs) that can disrupt nucleolar organization and rRNA expression. These disruptive sincRNAs can be unleashed by Pol II inhibition, senataxin loss, Ewing sarcoma or locus-associated R-loop repression through an experimental system involving the proteins RNaseH1, eGFP and dCas9 (which we refer to as 'red laser'). We reveal a nucleolar Pol-II-dependent mechanism that drives ribosome biogenesis, identify disease-associated disruption of nucleoli by noncoding RNAs, and establish locus-targeted R-loop modulation. Our findings revise theories of labour division between the major RNA polymerases, and identify nucleolar Pol II as a major factor in protein synthesis and nuclear organization, with potential implications for health and disease."
https://openalex.org/W3097612863,"High-speed actuation of laser frequency1 is critical in applications using lasers and frequency combs2,3, and is a prerequisite for phase locking, frequency stabilization and stability transfer among optical carriers. For example, high-bandwidth feedback control of frequency combs is used in optical-frequency synthesis4, frequency division5 and optical clocks6. Soliton microcombs7,8 have emerged as chip-scale frequency comb sources, and have been used in system-level demonstrations9,10. Yet integrated microcombs using thermal heaters have limited actuation bandwidths11,12 of up to 10 kilohertz. Consequently, megahertz-bandwidth actuation and locking of microcombs have only been achieved with off-chip bulk component modulators. Here we demonstrate high-speed soliton microcomb actuation using integrated piezoelectric components13. By monolithically integrating AlN actuators14 on ultralow-loss Si3N4 photonic circuits15, we demonstrate voltage-controlled soliton initiation, tuning and stabilization with megahertz bandwidth. The AlN actuators use 300 nanowatts of power and feature bidirectional tuning, high linearity and low hysteresis. They exhibit a flat actuation response up to 1 megahertz-substantially exceeding bulk piezo tuning bandwidth-that is extendable to higher frequencies by overcoming coupling to acoustic contour modes of the chip. Via synchronous tuning of the laser and the microresonator, we exploit this ability to frequency-shift the optical comb spectrum (that is, to change the comb's carrier-envelope offset frequency) and make excursions beyond the soliton existence range. This enables a massively parallel frequency-modulated engine16,17 for lidar (light detection and ranging), with increased frequency excursion, lower power and elimination of channel distortions resulting from the soliton Raman self-frequency shift. Moreover, by modulating at a rate matching the frequency of high-overtone bulk acoustic resonances18, resonant build-up of bulk acoustic energy allows a 14-fold reduction of the required driving voltage, making it compatible with CMOS (complementary metal-oxide-semiconductor) electronics. Our approach endows soliton microcombs with integrated, ultralow-power and fast actuation, expanding the repertoire of technological applications of microcombs."
https://openalex.org/W3043661890,"The majority of targeted therapies for non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC) are directed against oncogenic drivers that are more prevalent in patients with light exposure to tobacco smoke1-3. As this group represents around 20% of all patients with lung cancer, the discovery of stratified medicine options for tobacco-associated NSCLC is a high priority. Umbrella trials seek to streamline the investigation of genotype-based treatments by screening tumours for multiple genomic alterations and triaging patients to one of several genotype-matched therapeutic agents. Here we report the current outcomes of 19 drug-biomarker cohorts from the ongoing National Lung Matrix Trial, the largest umbrella trial in NSCLC. We use next-generation sequencing to match patients to appropriate targeted therapies on the basis of their tumour genotype. The Bayesian trial design enables outcome data from open cohorts that are still recruiting to be reported alongside data from closed cohorts. Of the 5,467 patients that were screened, 2,007 were molecularly eligible for entry into the trial, and 302 entered the trial to receive genotype-matched therapy-including 14 that re-registered to the trial for a sequential trial drug. Despite pre-clinical data supporting the drug-biomarker combinations, current evidence shows that a limited number of combinations demonstrate clinically relevant benefits, which remain concentrated in patients with lung cancers that are associated with minimal exposure to tobacco smoke."

https://openalex.org/W3042865808,"Mobile geolocation data is a valuable asset in the assessment of movement patterns of a population. Once a highly contagious disease takes place in a location the movement patterns aid in predicting the potential spatial spreading of the disease, hence mobile data becomes a crucial tool to epidemic models. In this work, based on millions of anonymized mobile visits data in Brazil, we investigate the most probable spreading patterns of the COVID-19 within states of Brazil. The study is intended to help public administrators in action plans and resources allocation, whilst studying how mobile geolocation data may be employed as a measure of population mobility during an epidemic. This study focuses on the states of São Paulo and Rio de Janeiro during the period of March 2020, when the disease first started to spread in these states. Metapopulation models for the disease spread were simulated in order to evaluate the risk of infection of each city within the states, by ranking them according to the time the disease will take to infect each city. We observed that, although the high-risk regions are those closer to the capital cities, where the outbreak has started, there are also cities in the countryside with great risk. The mathematical framework developed in this paper is quite general and may be applied to locations around the world to evaluate the risk of infection by diseases, in special the COVID-19, when geolocation data is available."
https://openalex.org/W3043465392,"Temperature is a key factor in the growth and development of all organisms1,2. Plants have to interpret temperature fluctuations, over hourly to monthly timescales, to align their growth and development with the seasons. Much is known about how plants respond to acute thermal stresses3,4, but the mechanisms that integrate long-term temperature exposure remain unknown. The slow, winter-long upregulation of VERNALIZATION INSENSITIVE 3 (VIN3)5–7, a PHD protein that functions with Polycomb repressive complex 2 to epigenetically silence FLOWERING LOCUS C (FLC) during vernalization, is central to plants interpreting winter progression5,6,8–11. Here, by a forward genetic screen, we identify two dominant mutations of the transcription factor NTL8 that constitutively activate VIN3 expression and alter the slow VIN3 cold induction profile. In the wild type, the NTL8 protein accumulates slowly in the cold, and directly upregulates VIN3 transcription. Through combining computational simulation and experimental validation, we show that a major contributor to this slow accumulation is reduced NTL8 dilution due to slow growth at low temperatures. Temperature-dependent growth is thus exploited through protein dilution to provide the long-term thermosensory information for VIN3 upregulation. Indirect mechanisms involving temperature-dependent growth, in addition to direct thermosensing, may be widely relevant in long-term biological sensing of naturally fluctuating temperatures. The authors find that slow plant growth at low temperatures during winter reduces dilution of the transcription factor NTL8, which allows slow accumulation of NTL8 and thus the gradual increase in transcription of VIN3—a gene involved in memory of cold exposure."
https://openalex.org/W3042709419,"The recent discovery of N6-methyladenine (N6-mA) in mammalian genomes suggests that it may serve as an epigenetic regulatory mechanism1. However, the biological role of N6-mA and the molecular pathways that exert its function remain unclear. Here we show that N6-mA has a key role in changing the epigenetic landscape during cell fate transitions in early development. We found that N6-mA is upregulated during the development of mouse trophoblast stem cells, specifically at regions of stress-induced DNA double helix destabilization (SIDD)2–4. Regions of SIDD are conducive to topological stress-induced unpairing of the double helix and have critical roles in organizing large-scale chromatin structures3,5,6. We show that the presence of N6-mA reduces the in vitro interactions by more than 500-fold between SIDD and SATB1, a crucial chromatin organizer that interacts with SIDD regions. Deposition of N6-mA also antagonizes SATB1 function in vivo by preventing its binding to chromatin. Concordantly, N6-mA functions at the boundaries between euchromatin and heterochromatin to restrict the spread of euchromatin. Repression of SIDD–SATB1 interactions mediated by N6-mA is essential for gene regulation during trophoblast development in cell culture models and in vivo. Overall, our findings demonstrate an unexpected molecular mechanism for N6-mA function via SATB1, and reveal connections between DNA modification, DNA secondary structures and large chromatin domains in early embryonic development. The DNA modification N6-methyladenine regulates gene expression during mouse trophoblast development by depositing at the boundaries of active chromatin and preventing its spread by antagonizing the chromatin organizer SATB1."
https://openalex.org/W3043456584,"Sleep duration and sleep quality are often linked to increased risk of mortality and morbidity. However, national representative data on both sleep duration and sleep quality and their relationship with chronic health problems are rarely available from the same source. This current study aimed to examine the independent and combined associations of sleep duration and sleep quality with physical and mental disorders, using data from the Singapore Mental Health Study 2016. 6,126 residents aged ≥18years participated in this epidemiological, cross-sectional survey. Sleep measures were assessed using the Pittsburg Sleep Quality Index while lifetime or 12-month medical and psychiatric diagnoses were established using the Composite International Diagnostic Interview 3.0. Both short sleep (<6hrs compared to 7-8hrs) and poor sleep were found to be independently associated with chronic pain, obsessive compulsive disorder and any mental disorder while poor sleep was additionally associated with major depressive disorder, bipolar disorder, generalized anxiety disorder and any physical disorder, when adjusted for confounders. Poor sleep combined with short sleep (≤6hrs/day vs 7-8hrs/day) was associated with the highest number of comorbidities among other sleep combinations. Sleep duration and sleep quality, when adjusted for each other, remained independently associated with both physical and mental disorders. Affective disorders may be more closely related to poor sleep quality compared to abnormal sleep duration. Our findings suggest sleep quality to be a more important indicator for psychological and overall health compared to sleep duration."

https://openalex.org/W3042592762,"Soybean cyst nematode (SCN), Heterodera glycines Ichinohe, is one of the most devastating pathogens affecting soybean production in the U.S. and worldwide. The use of SCN-resistant soybean cultivars is one of the most affordable strategies to cope with SCN infestation. Because of the limited sources of SCN resistance and changes in SCN virulence phenotypes, host resistance in current cultivars has increasingly been overcome by the pathogen. Host tolerance has been recognized as an additional tool to manage the SCN. The objectives of this study were to conduct a genome-wide association study (GWAS), to identify single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) markers, and to perform a genomic selection (GS) study for SCN tolerance in soybean based on reduction in biomass. A total of 234 soybean genotypes (lines) were evaluated for their tolerance to SCN in greenhouse using four replicates. The tolerance index (TI = 100 × Biomass of a line in SCN infested / Biomass of the line without SCN) was used as phenotypic data of SCN tolerance. GWAS was conducted using a total of 3,782 high quality SNPs. GS was performed based upon the whole set of SNPs and the GWAS-derived SNPs, respectively. Results showed that (1) a large variation in soybean TI to SCN infection among the soybean genotypes was identified; (2) a total of 35, 21, and 6 SNPs were found to be associated with SCN tolerance using the models SMR, GLM (PCA), and MLM (PCA+K) with 6 SNPs overlapping between models; (3) GS accuracy was SNP set-, model-, and training population size-dependent; and (4) genes around Glyma.06G134900, Glyma.15G097500.1, Glyma.15G100900.3, Glyma.15G105400, Glyma.15G107200, and Glyma.19G121200.1 (Table 4). Glyma.06G134900, Glyma.15G097500.1, Glyma.15G100900.3, Glyma.15G105400, and Glyma.19G121200.1 are best candidates. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first report highlighting SNP markers associated with tolerance index based on biomass reduction under SCN infestation in soybean. This research opens a new approach to use SCN tolerance in soybean breeding and the SNP markers will provide a tool for breeders to select for SCN tolerance."
https://openalex.org/W3043255896,"The construction of artificial structures, such as seawalls, is increasing globally, resulting in loss of habitat complexity and native species biodiversity. There is increasing interest in mitigating this biodiversity loss by adding topographic habitat to these structures, and/or seeding them with habitat-forming species. Settlement tile experiments, comparing colonisation of species to more and less complex habitats, have been used to inform eco-engineering interventions prior to their large-scale implementation. Most studies have focused on applying one type of intervention (either adding habitat structure or seeding with native organisms), so it is unclear whether there are greater benefits to biodiversity when multiple interventions are combined. Using a fully orthogonal experiment, we assessed the independent and interactive effects of habitat structure (flat vs. crevice/ridges) and seeding with native oysters (unseeded vs. seeded) on the biodiversity of four different functional groups (sessile and mobile taxa, cryptobenthic and pelagic fishes). Concrete tiles (flat unseeded, flat seeded, complex unseeded and complex seeded) were deployed at two sites in Sydney Harbour and monitored over 12 months, for the survival and colonisation of oysters and the species density and abundances of the four functional groups. The survival of seeded oysters was greater on the complex than flat tiles, at one of the two sites, due to the protective role of crevices. Despite this, after 12 months, the species density of sessile invertebrates and the percentage cover of seeded and colonising oysters did not differ between complex and seeded tiles each of which supported more of these variables than the flat unseeded tiles. In contrast, the species density of mobile invertebrates and cryptobenthic fishes and the MaxN of pelagic fishes, at 1 month, were only positively influenced by seeding with oysters, which provided food as well as habitat. Within the complex seeded and unseeded tiles, there was a greater species density of sessile taxa, survival and percentage cover of oysters in the crevices, which were more humid and darker at month 12, had lower high temperature extremes at months 1 and 12, than on the ridges or flat tiles. Our results suggest that eco-engineering projects which seek to maximise the biodiversity of multiple functional groups on seawalls, should apply a variety of different microhabitats and habitat-forming species, to alter the environmental conditions available to organisms."

However, little is known about the sub-continental origins of these three main ancestries. We present new high-throughput genotyping data for 87 admixed individuals across Argentina. This data was combined to previously published data for admixed individuals in the region and then compared to different reference panels specifically built to perform population structure analyses at a sub-continental level. Concerning the Native American ancestry, we could identify four Native American components segregating in modern Argentinean populations. Three of them are also found in modern South American populations and are specifically represented in Central Andes, Central Chile/Patagonia, and Subtropical and Tropical Forests geographic areas. The fourth component might be specific to the Central Western region of Argentina, and it is not well represented in any genomic data from the literature. As for the European and African ancestries, we confirmed previous results about origins from Southern Europe, Western and Central Western Africa, and we provide evidences for the presence of Northern European and Eastern African ancestries."
https://openalex.org/W3043753412,"During the course of the asexual erythrocytic stage of development, Plasmodium spp. parasites undergo a series of morphological changes and induce alterations in the host cell. At the end of this stage, the parasites egress from the infected cell, after which the progeny invade a new host cell. These processes are rapid and occur in a time-dependent manner. Of particular importance, egress and invasion of erythrocytes by the parasite are difficult to capture in an unsynchronized culture, or even a culture that has been synchronized within a window of one to several hours. Therefore, precise synchronization of parasite cultures is of paramount importance for the investigation of these processes. Here we describe a method for synchronizing Plasmodium falciparum and Plasmodium knowlesi asexual blood stage parasites with ML10, a highly specific inhibitor of the cGMP-dependent protein kinase (PKG) that arrests parasite growth approximately 15 minutes prior to egress. This inhibitor allows parasite cultures to be synchronized so that all parasites are within a window of development of several minutes, with a simple wash step. Furthermore, we show that parasites remain viable for several hours after becoming arrested by the compound and that ML10 has advantages, owing to its high specificity and low EC50, over the previously used PKG inhibitor Compound 2. Here, we demonstrate that ML10 is an invaluable tool for the study of Plasmodium spp. asexual blood stage biology and for the routine synchronization of P. falciparum and P. knowlesi cultures."

We aimed to investigate the association of workplace gender discrimination and depressive symptoms among employed women in South Korea.The 6th wave (2016) survey datasets of the Korean Longitudinal Survey of Women and Family (KLoWF) were analyzed for 2,339 respondents who are identified as wage workers. Depressive symptoms were evaluated by the short-form (10-item) Center for Epidemiological Studies-Depression scale. Association of workplace gender discrimination and depressive symptoms was assessed using multivariate logistic regression, adjusted for potential confounding variables including age, income satisfaction, education level, marital status, and currently diagnosed disease. We then measured the age effect using age stratification multivariate logistic regression model.Women who experienced gender discrimination at workplace had higher odds of depressive symptoms regardless of the type of the discrimination including hiring, promotion, work assignments, paid wages, and firing. These associations were consistent in younger women below 40 years of age in regard to hiring, promotion, paid wages and firing, whereas inconsistent among older women above 40 years of age.We did not investigate the effect of workplace gender discrimination on depressive symptoms in a longitudinal manner.Workplace gender discrimination was found to be significantly associated with depressive symptoms after adjustment for socio-demographic factors. Further, women under 40 years of age were especially vulnerable to workplace gender discrimination."

Twenty NPT genotypes were found promising with an average grain yield varying from 5.45 to 8.8 t/ha. A total of 85 SSR markers were used in the study to identify QTLs associated with grain yield per se and related traits. Sixty-six (77.65%) markers were found to be polymorphic. The PIC values varied from 0.516 to 0.92 with an average of 0.704. A moderate level of genetic diversity (0.39) was detected among genotypes. Variation to the tune of 8% within genotypes, 68% among the genotypes within the population and 24% among the populations were observed (AMOVA). This information may help in identification of potential parents for development of transgressive segregants with very high yield. The association analysis using GLM and MLM models led to the identification of 30 and 10 SSR markers associated with 70 and 16 QTLs, respectively. Thirty novel QTLs linked with 16 SSRs were identified to be associated with eleven traits, namely tiller number (qTL-6.1, qTL-11.1, qTL-4.1), panicle length (qPL-1.1, qPL-5.1, qPL-7.1, qPL-8.1), flag leaf length (qFLL-8.1, qFLL-9.1), flag leaf width (qFLW-6.2, qFLW-5.1, qFLW-8.1, qFLW-7.1), total no. of grains (qTG-2.2, qTG-a7.1), thousand-grain weight (qTGW-a1.1, qTGW-a9.2, qTGW-5.1, qTGW-8.1), fertile grains (qFG-7.1), seed length-breadth ratio (qSlb-3.1), plant height (qPHT-6.1, qPHT-9.1), days to 50% flowering (qFD-1.1) and grain yield per se (qYLD-5.1, qYLD-6.1a, qYLD-11.1).Some of the SSRs were co-localized with more than two traits. The highest co-localization was identified with RM5709 linked to nine traits, followed by RM297 with five traits. Similarly, RM5575, RM204, RM168, RM112, RM26499 and RM22899 were also recorded to be co-localized with more than one trait and could be rated as important for marker-assisted backcross breeding programs, for pyramiding of these QTLs for important yield traits, to produce new-generation rice for prospective increment in yield potentiality and breaking yield ceiling."
https://openalex.org/W3043186161,"Erythropoietin (EPO) regulates erythropoiesis by binding to erythropoietin receptor (Epor) on erythroid progenitor cells. Epor is also expressed on bone forming osteoblasts and bone loss accompanies EPO-stimulated erythropoiesis in mice. Mice with Epor restricted to erythroid tissue exhibit reduced bone and increased marrow adipocytes; in contrast, transgenic mice (Tg) with osteoblastic-specific deletion of Epor exhibit reduced trabecular bone with age without change in marrow adipocytes. By 12 weeks, male Tg mice had 22.2% and female Tg mice had 29.6% reduced trabecular bone volume (BV) compared to controls. EPO administration (1200 U/kg) for 10 days reduced trabecular bone in control mice but not in Tg mice. There were no differences in numbers of osteoblasts, osteoclasts, and marrow adipocytes in Tg mice, suggesting independence of EPO signaling in mature osteoblasts, osteoclasts, and adipocytes. Female Tg mice had increased number of dying osteocytes and male Tg mice had a trend for more empty lacunae. Osteogenic cultures from Tg mice had reduced differentiation and mineralization with reduced Alpl and Runx2 transcripts. In conclusion, endogenous EPO-Epor signaling in osteoblasts is important in bone remodeling, particularly trabecular bone and endogenous Epor expression in osteoblasts is required for bone loss accompanying EPO-stimulated erythropoiesis."

https://openalex.org/W3043374831,"Morphometry characterization is an important procedure in describing neuronal cultures and identifying phenotypic differences. This task usually requires labor-intensive measurements and the classification of numerous neurites from large numbers of neurons in culture. To automate these measurements, we wrote AutoNeuriteJ, an imageJ/Fiji plugin that measures and classifies neurites from a very large number of neurons. We showed that AutoNeuriteJ is able to detect variations of neuritic growth induced by several compounds known to affect the neuronal growth. In these experiments measurement of more than 5000 mouse neurons per conditions was obtained within a few hours. Moreover, by analyzing mouse neurons deficient for the microtubule associated protein 6 (MAP6) and wild type neurons we illustrate that AutoNeuriteJ is capable to detect subtle phenotypic difference in axonal length. Overall the use of AutoNeuriteJ will provide rapid, unbiased and accurate measurement of neuron morphologies."
https://openalex.org/W3042670386,"Understanding the determinants of range location and size is fundamental to our understanding of spatial patterns in species richness. Here, we aimed to test the role of 'climatic stability' in determining latitudinal trends in range size and as a consequence on species richness of tropical woody plants. Using primary data from 156 (0.06 ha) plots comprising 20,400 occurrences of more than 400 species of tropical woody plants, we built a biome-wide species database that covers the entire latitudinal extent of the wet-evergreen forests of the Western Ghats (8o to 20o N), India. We consolidated this database using secondary data from other published species inventories. We then calculated the range sizes and climatic niche width of woody plants to test the predictions of the climatic stability hypothesis and examined the relationship between range position and climatic tolerance of species. Our results show a significant latitudinal gradient in species richness and turnover where local and regional species richness increase monotonically from higher latitudes to lower latitudes of the Western Ghats. We found strong support for Rapoport's Rule with an increase in range size from lower to higher latitudes; our results are consistent with the predictions of the climatic stability hypothesis, where species at higher latitudes exhibited greater tolerance to temperature and rainfall seasonality. Contrary to earlier work, our findings suggest that Rapoport's Rule and the climatic stability hypothesis can operate over regional scales, and even at lower latitudes. We suggest that latitude associated climatic seasonality through its influence on species ranges, can influence latitudinal patterns in species turnover as well as species richness."

In this study, a spiral grooved-wheel fertilizer discharge device was designed to replace the conventional straight grooved-wheel. Comparisons of the fertilizer discharge performance of the two grooved-wheel types were performed through tests and simulations using the discrete element method (DEM). The discharge performance of the two discharge devices was assessed by measuring the discharge mass rate, discharge uniformity, and the falling velocity of the fertilizer particles. Results showed that under similar conditions, the fertilizer discharge mass rate of the spiral grooved-wheel was higher than that of the straight grooved-wheel. The fertilizer discharge uniformity of the spiral grooved-wheel was much better than that of the straight grooved-wheel. The average falling velocity of fertilizer particles through the discharge spout was higher under the spiral grooved-wheel. The relative errors between the test and simulation results for the discharge mass rates, discharge uniformity, and particle falling velocities of the spiral grooved-wheel were all less than 10%. The developed spiral grooved-wheel exhibited a better performance than the conventional straight grooved-wheel, in all the aspects examined. The results serve as a theoretical basis for guiding the design of high-performance fertilizer applicators."

https://openalex.org/W3043192890,"This study tested the hypothesis that in human aging, a decreased intramuscular acylcarnitine status is associated with (pre-)frailty, reduced physical performance, and altered mitochondrial function. We used a cross-sectional study design with well-matched fit and (pre-)frail old males and females, using young males and females as healthy controls. Frailty was assessed according to the Fried criteria and physical performance was determined by 400 m walk test, short physical performance battery and handgrip strength. Muscle and plasma acylcarnitine status, and muscle mitochondrial gene expression was analyzed. Results showed that intramuscular total carnitine levels and short-chain acylcarnitine levels were lower in (pre-)frail old females compared to fit old females and young females, whereas no differences were observed in males. The low intramuscular short-chain acylcarnitine levels in females correlated with low physical performance, even after correction for muscle mass (%), and were accompanied with lowered expression of genes involved in mitochondrial energy production and functionality. It is, therefore, concluded that in (pre-)frail old females, intramuscular total carnitine levels and short-chain acylcarnitine levels are decreased, and this decrease is associated with reduced physical performance and low expression of a wide range of genes critical for mitochondrial function. The results stress the importance of taking sex differences into account in aging research."

The aim of this study was to use a multi-dimensional measurement tool to describe the health literacy of people living in a fishing community in northern Egypt.Data were collected from 436 people (fisherman and their families), using the Health Literacy Questionnaire (HLQ), which includes 9 scales. Effect sizes (ES) for standardized mean differences estimated the magnitude of difference between demographic groups.The mean age of participants was 42 years, 50% were male, 42% were working in the fishing sector, 17.9% had access to the Internet and 36.8% were illiterate. Male participants showed higher capabilities in scales 3. Actively managing my health and 4. Social support for health (ES = 0.21 and 0.27, respectively). In comparison to other occupations, fishing occupation had a negative impact on scale 7. Navigating the healthcare system (ES -0.23). Also, higher educational level was associated with higher HLQ indicators. Across all scales, scale 2. Having sufficient information to manage my health showed the lowest mean (SD) score; 2.23 (0.76) indicating that most people reported they didn't have enough information.This study has revealed that fishermen and their families have a wide range of health literacy difficulties which are likely to have profound negative effects on health behavior and health outcomes."
https://openalex.org/W3043499949,"Background Subjects with chronic kidney disease are at increased risk for contrast-induced acute kidney injury (CI-AKI). Risk stratification is traditionally based on glomerular filtration rate (GFR) and proteinuria. The present trial examines, whether tubular and inflammatory biomarkers are able to identify subjects at increased risk as well. Methods We performed a prospective study in 490 patients undergoing coronary angiography. An increase of serum creatinine concentration ≥ 0.3 mg/dl from baseline to day 2–3 was defined as primary endpoint (CI-AKI). Urinary neutrophil gelatinase-associated lipocalin (NGAL), kidney injury molecule-1 (KIM-1), and calprotectin were assessed < 24h before coronary angiography. Prognostic accuracy was assessed by receiver operating characteristics (ROC) calculations. Results 30 (6.1%) patients suffered from CI-AKI (27 AKIN stage I, 3 AKIN stage II, 0 AKIN stage III). Those subjects who developed CI-AKI had 3.1 fold higher baseline urinary NGAL/creatinine ratios than those without CI-AKI (60.8 [IQR 18.7–93.1] μg/mg vs. 19.9 [IQR 12.3–38.9] μg/mg, p = 0.001). In those subjects without clinically overt CKD (eGFR > 60 ml/min, urinary albumin creatinine ratio <30 mg/g), the NGAL/creatinine ratio was 2.6 higher in CI-AKI vs. no CI-AKI (47.8 [IQR 11.8–75.3] vs. 18.6 [IQR 11.7–36.3] μg/mg). No significant differences were obtained for KIM-1 and calprotectin (p>0.05 each). ROC analyses revealed an area under the curve (AUC) of 0.68 (95% CI 0.60–0.81) for NGAL/creatinine. An NGAL/creatinine ratio < 56.4 μg/mg has a negative predictive value of 96.5%. Conclusions The present study is the largest investigation on the use of urinary biomarkers for CI-AKI risk stratification so far. It shows that NGAL provides prognostic information beyond the glomerular biomarkers eGFR and proteinuria."
https://openalex.org/W3042433356,"Objective To investigate the risk factors for BPD severity by gestational age (GA) and identify a way to reduce the incidence of moderate-to-severe BPD Study design This was a retrospective cohort study of very-low-birth-weight-infants (VLBWIs) delivered at 24 to 28 weeks GA from Korean Neonatal Network registry between 2013 and 2016. BPD was defined using the National Institutes of Health criteria. Study populations were divided by GA and subdivided into no/mild BPD and moderate/severe BPD. The initial statuses of all infants, including those who died before BPD diagnosis and the maternal and neonatal factors of the live infants were compared. Statistical methods included descriptive statistics, comparative tests, and logistic regression. Results Of 3,976 infants, 3,717 were included (24weeks, n = 456; 25 weeks, n = 650, 26 weeks, n = 742; 27 weeks, n = 836; 28 weeks, n = 1,033). The overall mortality rate was 18% and the rates by GA were 43%, 29%, 11%, and 6% in the 24-, 25-, 26-, 27-, 28-GA groups, respectively. Small for GA (SGA), treated patent ductus arteriosus (PDA), hypotension, and late-onset sepsis were significant risk factors for developing moderate/severe BPD in the 25 to 28-week GA groups in the multivariate analyses. However, for infants born at 24 weeks GA, there were no significant risk factors apart from initial resuscitation. Conclusions Effective initial resuscitation was the most important factor for infants delivered at 24 weeks GA determining the severity of BPD. For infants delivered between 25 and 28 weeks, judicious care of SGA infants, aggressive treatment for PDA and hypotension, and intense efforts to decrease the sepsis rate are needed to reduce the development of moderate-to-severe BPD."
https://openalex.org/W3043239280,"In recent years, the incidence of tuberculosis (TB) has declined worldwide, although this disease still occurs at relatively high rates in Amerindian populations. This suggests that the genetic ancestry of Amerindians may be an important factor in the development of infections, and may account for at least some of the variation in infection rates in the different populations. The present study investigated the potential influence of Amerindian genetic ancestry on susceptibility to tuberculosis in an Amazon population. The study included 280 patients diagnosed with tuberculosis and 138 asymptomatic hospital employees with no history of TB, but who were in contact with bacterially active TB patients. Ancestry analysis was run on a set of 61 Ancestry-Informative Markers to estimate European, African, and Amerindian genetic ancestry using STRUCTURE v2.2. The TB group had significantly higher Amerindian ancestry in comparison with the control group, and significantly lower European ancestry. Amerindian ancestry in the 20–60% range was found to be the principal risk factor for increased susceptibility to TB. The results of the study indicate that Amerindian ancestry is an important risk factor for susceptibility to TB in the admixed population of the Brazilian Amazon region."

We investigated the risk of subsequent myocardial infarction and ischemic stroke according to weight gain after smoking cessation, using a nationwide population based cohort. We enrolled 3,797,572 Korean adults aged over 40 years who participated in national health screenings between 2009 and 2010. Subjects who quit smoking were classified into three subgroups according to the weight change between baseline and 4 years prior. Myocardial infarctions and ischemic strokes were followed until the end of 2015. We compared the hazard ratios among smoking cessation subgroups, non-smokers, and current smokers. The mean changes in weight (1.5 ± 3.9 kg) of the smoking cessation group were higher than those of the other groups (p < 0.0001). A total of 31,277 and 46,811 subjects were newly diagnosed with myocardial infarction and ischemic stroke, respectively. Regardless of weight change, all subgroups of smoking cessation had significantly less risk than current smokers. The subgroup of smoking cessation with weight gain over 4kg showed the lowest risk for myocardial infarctions (hazard ratio 0.646, 95% confidence interval 0.583–0.714, p < 0.0001) and ischemic strokes (hazard ratio 0.648, 95% confidence interval 0.591–0.71, p < 0.0001) after multivariable adjustment. In conclusion, weight gain after smoking cessation did not adversely affect the cardiovascular protective effect."
https://openalex.org/W3043662595,"Deregulation of Src kinases is associated with cancer. We previously showed that SrcDN conditional expression in MCF7 cells reduces tumorigenesis and causes tumor regression in mice. However, it remained unclear whether SrcDN affected breast cancer stem cell functionality or it reduced tumor mass. Here, we address this question by isolating an enriched population of Breast Cancer Stem Cells (BCSCs) from MCF7 cells with inducible expression of SrcDN. Induction of SrcDN inhibited self-renewal, and stem-cell marker expression (Nanog, Oct3-4, ALDH1, CD44). Quantitative proteomic analyses of mammospheres from MCF7-Tet-On-SrcDN cells (data are available via ProteomeXchange with identifier PXD017789, project DOI: 10.6019/PXD017789) and subsequent GSEA showed that SrcDN expression inhibited glycolysis. Indeed, induction of SrcDN inhibited expression and activity of hexokinase, pyruvate kinase and lactate dehydrogenase, resulting in diminished glucose consumption and lactate production, which restricted Warburg effect. Thus, c-Src functionality is important for breast cancer stem cell maintenance and renewal, and stem cell transcription factor expression, effects linked to glucose metabolism reduction."

The aim of this study was to evaluate the perceptions and experiences of 1) people living with HIV infection and comorbid hypertension, and 2) their healthcare providers, related to their diagnoses and interactions with chronic healthcare services in South Africa. Methods This study comprised quantitative and qualitative arms with a multi-layered approach. We randomly selected 17 public healthcare facilities providing HIV care across Cape Town and surrounding rural municipalities. Results Interviews were conducted with clinicians (n = 11), specialised nursing professionals (n = 10), lay counsellors (n = 12), six patients focus groups (n = 35) and 20 in-depth individual patient interviews. There were mixed views on being treated at integrated vs. separate chronic care facilities regarding quality of care and privacy/anonymity. Specialised clinics offered better care for HIV infection while hypertension and other non-communicable diseases were neglected. Privacy about HIV status maybe better maintained in integrated clinics but not if status was disclosed by having the green-coloured HIV treatment card. A single appointment date was considered advantageous as it saved time and money leading to greater compliance; however, waiting times at clinics were longer with perhaps fewer patients seen. Conclusions The mixed reactions elicited to the integration of healthcare services for HIV, hypertension and other non-communicable diseases highlights the complexities involved in implementing such services. Greater human resources with retraining and reskilling of healthcare staff is required for the optimal management of chronic multi-morbidities."
https://openalex.org/W3042259284,"Globally, about one in four people develop a psychiatric disorder during their lifetime. Specifically, the lifetime prevalence of schizophrenia is about 0.48%, and schizophrenia can have detrimental effects on a patient’s life. Therefore, estimating the economic burden of schizophrenia is important. We investigated the cost-of-illness trend of schizophrenia in South Korea from 2006 to 2016. The cost-of-illness trend was estimated from a societal perspective using a prevalence-based approach for direct costs and a human capital approach for indirect costs. We utilized information from the following sources: 1) National Health Insurance Service, 2) Korean Statistical Information Service, Statistics Korea, 3) the National Survey of Persons with Disabilities, 4) Budget and Fund Operation Plan, Ministry of Justice, 5) Budget and Fund Operation Plan, Ministry of Health and Welfare, and 6) annual reports from the National Mental Health Welfare Commission. Direct healthcare costs, direct non-healthcare costs, and indirect costs by sex and age group were calculated along with sensitivity analyses of the estimates. The cost-of-illness of schizophrenia in Korea steadily increased from 2006 to 2016, with most costs being indirect costs. Individuals in their 40s and 50s accounted for most of the direct and indirect costs. Among indirect costs, the costs due to unemployment were most prevalent. Our estimation implies that schizophrenia is associated with a vast cost-of-illness in Korea. Policymakers, researchers, and physicians need to put effort into shortening the duration of untreated psychosis, guide patients to receive community-care-based services rather than hospital-based services and empower lay people to learn about schizophrenia."

Methods Participants ≥20 years of age in Korea National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey 2010–2011 were divided into two groups, those with higher and lower IOP values, compared with the reference IOP value. We compared the risk of OAG in each group using regression analyses. The IOP value that yielded the highest statistical significance was determined as an IOP significantly associated with the OAG risk. Results A total of 7,650 participants (7,292 control, 358 OAG) were included. The mean IOP was significantly higher in OAG group (14.4 ± 2.9 mmHg), compared to control group (13.9 ± 2.7 mmHg, P = 0.022). In association with an increased risk of OAG, the significant IOP value was 18 mmHg (Odds ratio [OR] = 1.79, 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.14–2.80, P = 0.011). Additionally, sex-difference was identified and they were 19 mmHg (OR = 2.79, 95% CI 1.27–6.16, P = 0.011) in men and 18 mmHg (OR = 2.65, 95% CI 1.32–5.33, P = 0.006) in women. The IOP values associated with significantly decreased risk of glaucoma were determined to be 14 mmHg in men (OR = 0.68, 95% CI 0.47–0.99, P = 0.042) and 16 mmHg in women (OR = 0.47, 95% CI 0.27–0.81, P = 0.007). Conclusions In consideration of the risk to benefit ratio, the reference IOP level for screening or setting the target IOP for treatment could be considered different from traditional 21 mmHg in Korean population."

Six basic emotions are recognized through facial expressions in addition to the physiological state, which is recognized through the body posture. The facial expressions and body posture are acquired in real-time from a Kinect sensor. A scoring system is used to improve recognition by minimizing the confusion between the different emotions. The implemented solution achieves an accuracy rate of above 90%. The recognized emotion is then used to derive an Automatic AUI where the user can use speech commands to modify the User Interface (UI) automatically. A comprehensive user study is performed to compare the usability of an Automatic, Manual, and a Hybrid AUI. The AUIs are evaluated in terms of their efficiency, effectiveness, productivity, and error safety. Additionally, a comprehensive analysis is performed to evaluate the results from the viewpoint of different genders and age groups. Results show that the hybrid adaptation improves usability in terms of productivity and efficiency.

From the 783 peer-reviewed papers produced by 48 projects identified from project bibliographies, 12,380 citations were identified using the Web of Science archive and their citation search engine to the end of 2018. Various conventional productivity and impact measures were applied including the Impact Factor, H and M-indices, and entry into the Top-1000 papers in cited research. The earth science projects tend to under-perform in terms of Impact Factor (IF = 14-20) and the M-index (M<0.5) but perform at the level of a 'tenured professor' with <H> = 23. When compared to non-citizen science research in general, there is a ten-fold higher probability of the earth science papers reaching the Top-1000 threshold of most-cited papers in natural science research. Some of the reasons for the lower performance by some indicators may have to do with the down-turn in published papers after 2010 for the majority of the earth science projects, which itself could be related to the fact that 52% of these projects only became operational after 2010 compared to the more successful 'Top-3' projects, whose impacts resemble the general population of non-citizen science research."

Work in model organisms has demonstrated that benefits of exercise can be provided to stationary animals by daily intermittent stimulation of adrenergic signaling. Here, we examine as a proof of principle whether exposure of human participants to virtual reality (VR) simulation of exercise can alter sympathovagal balance in stationary humans. In this study, 24 participants performed 15 minutes of cycling exercise at standardized resistance, then repeated the exercise with a virtual reality helmet that provided an immersive environment. On a separate day, they each controlled a virtual environment for 15 minutes to simulate exercise without actual cycling exercise. Response to each treatment was assessed by measuring heart rate (HR), norepinephrine, and heart rate variability, and each participant’s response to virtual exercise was compared internally to his/her response to the actual cycling. We found that neither post-exercise norepinephrine nor post-exercise HR was significantly increased by VR simulation. However, heart rate variability measured during virtual exercise was comparable to actual cycling in participants that engaged in moderate exercise, but not in those that engaged in high-intensity exercise. These findings suggest that virtual exercise has the potential to mimic some effects of moderate exercise. Further work will be needed to examine the longitudinal effects of chronic exposure to VR-simulated exercise."

To assess the influence of Tas1r3 polymorphisms on feeding behavior and metabolism, we examined the phenotype of F1 male hybrids obtained from crosses between the following inbred mouse strains: females from 129SvPasCrl (129S2) bearing the recessive Tas1r3 allele and males from either C57BL/6J (B6), carrying the dominant allele, or the Tas1r3-gene knockout strain C57BL/6J-Tas1r3tm1Rfm (B6-Tas1r3-/-). The hybrids 129S2B6F1 and 129S2B6-Tas1r3-/-F1 had identical background genotypes and different sets of Tas1r3 alleles. The effect of Tas1r3 hemizygosity was analyzed by comparing the parental strain B6 (Tas1r3 homozygote) and hemizygous F1 hybrids B6 × B6-Tas1r3-/-. Data showed that, in 129S2B6-Tas1r3-/-F1 hybrids, the reduction of glucose tolerance, along with lower consumption of and lower preference for sweeteners during the initial licking responses, is due to expression of the recessive Tas1r3 allele. Hemizygosity of Tas1r3 did not influence these behavioral and metabolic traits. However, the loss of the functional Tas1r3 allele was associated with a small decline in the long-term intake and preference for sweeteners and reduction of plasma insulin and body, liver, and fat mass."
https://openalex.org/W3043593294,"Study has been made of the thermoluminescence yield of various novel tailor-made silica fibres, 6 and 8 mol % Ge-doped, with four differing outer dimensions, comprised of flat and cylindrical shapes, subjected to electron irradiation. Main thermoluminescence dosimetric characteristics have been investigated, including the glow curve, dose response, energy dependence, minimum detectable dose, effective atomic number, linearity of index and sensitivity of the fibres. The studies have also established the uncertainties involved as well as the stability of response in terms of fading effect, reproducibility and annealing. In addition, dose-rate dependence was accounted for as this has the potential to be a significant factor in radiotherapy applications. The 6 and 8 mol % fibres have been found to provide highly linear dose response within the range 1 to 4 Gy, the smallest size flat fibre, 6 mol% Ge-doped, showing the greatest response by a factor of 1.1 with respect to the highly popular LiF phosphor-based medium TLD100. All of the fibres also showed excellent reproducibility with a standard deviation of < 2% and < 4% for 6 and 8 mol % Ge-doped fibres respectively. For fading evaluation, the smallest 6 mol% Ge-doped dimension flat fibre, i.e., 85 × 270 μm displayed the lowest signal loss within 120 days post-irradiation, at around 26.9% also showing a response superior to that of all of the other fibres. Moreover, all the fibres and TLD-100 chips showed independence with respect to electron irradiation energy and dose-rate. Compared with the 8 mol% Ge-doped optical fibres, the 6 mol% Ge-doped flat optical fibres have been demonstrated to possess more desirable performance features for passive dosimetry, serving as a suitable alternative to TLD-100 for medical irradiation treatment applications."
https://openalex.org/W3042855730,"Most people struggle to understand probability which is an issue for Human-Robot Interaction (HRI) researchers who need to communicate risks and uncertainties to the participants in their studies, the media and policy makers. Previous work showed that even the use of numerical values to express probabilities does not guarantee an accurate understanding by laypeople. We therefore investigate if words can be used to communicate probability, such as ""likely"" and ""almost certainly not"". We embedded these phrases in the context of the usage of autonomous vehicles. The results show that the association of phrases to percentages is not random and there is a preferred order of phrases. The association is, however, not as consistent as hoped for. Hence, it would be advisable to complement the use of words with numerical expression of uncertainty.

Two different age groups completed self-report measures of the positive directive (planning for present and future behaviors) and social (communication) uses of autobiographical memory, as well as maladaptive rumination and depression symptom severity. Young participants (Mean age: 21.82) ruminated more and reported greater frequency of using the directive and social functions of thinking and talking about past experiences than older adults (Mean age: 71.82). These reminiscence processes were also differentially associated with depression symptoms between age groups when tested in structural equation models. In older participants, but not young participants, the directive function was negatively associated with depression severity; in young participants, but not old participants, the social function was negatively associated with depression severity. Furthermore, although depressive and abstract rumination was directly positively related to depression scores in both samples, this association was inverted when the effect of rumination on depression was calculated through functions of reminiscence. The implications of these results for intervention development in older versus young adults, is discussed."

This means that a reasonable prediction of body composition helps to improve model users’ health. To overcome the low accuracy and poor adaptability of existing human body composition prediction models and obtain higher efficiency, we proposed a novel method for predicting human body composition which uses a modified adaptive genetic algorithm (MAGA). Methods Firstly, since there are many parameters for a human body composition model, and these parameters are associated, we designed a new parameter selection approach by combining the improved RReliefF method with the mRMR method. Following this, selected parameters were used to establish a model that fits body composition. Secondly, in order to accurately calculate the weight of parameters in this model, we proposed a solution which used a modified adaptive genetic algorithm, taking advantage of both roulette and optimum reservation strategies. This solution also has an improved selection operator. Thirdly, taking the percentage of body fat (PBF) as an example of body composition, we conducted experiments to compare performance between our algorithm and other algorithms. Results Through our simulations, we demonstrated that the adaptability of the proposed model is 0.9921, the mean relative error is 0.05%, the mean square error is 1.3 and the correlation coefficient is 0.982. When compared with the indexes of other models, our model has the highest adaptability and the smallest error. Additionally, the suggested model, which has a training time of 28.58s and a running time of 2.84s, is faster than some models. Conclusion The PBF prediction model established by MAGA has high accuracy, stronger generalization ability and higher efficiency, which could provide a new method for human composition prediction."
https://openalex.org/W3043716782,"Objectives We aimed to assess prevalence of left ventricular (LV) systolic and diastolic function in stable cohort of COPD patients, where LV disease had been thoroughly excluded in advance. Methods 100 COPD outpatients in GOLD II-IV and 34 controls were included. Patients were divided by invasive mean pulmonary artery pressure (mPAP) in COPD-PH (≥25 mmHg) and COPD-non-PH (<25 mmHg), which was subdivided in mPAP ≤20 mmHg and 21–24 mmHg. LV myocardial performance index (LV MPI) and strain by tissue Doppler imaging (TDI) were used for evaluation of LV global and systolic function, respectively. LV MPI ≥0.51 and strain ≤-15.8% were considered abnormal. LV diastolic function was assessed by the ratio between peak early (E) and late (A) velocity, early TDI E´, E/E´, isovolumic relaxation time, and left atrium volume. Results LV MPI ≥0.51 was found in 64.9% and 88.5% and LV strain ≤-15.8% in 62.2.% and 76.9% in the COPD-non-PH and COPD-PH patients, respectively. Similarly, LV MPI and LV strain were impaired even in patients with mPAP <20 mmHg. In multiple regression analyses, residual volume and stroke volume were best associated to LV MPI and LV strain, respectively. Except for isovolumic relaxation time, standard diastolic echo indices as E/A, E´, E/E´ and left atrium volume did not change from normal individuals to COPD-non-PH. Conclusions Subclinical LV systolic dysfunction was a frequent finding in this cohort of COPD patients, even in those with normal pulmonary artery pressure. Evidence of LV diastolic dysfunction was hardly present as measured by conventional echo indices."
