https://openalex.org/W4224218779,"Most spatial transcriptomics technologies are limited by their resolution, with spot sizes larger than that of a single cell. Although joint analysis with single-cell RNA sequencing can alleviate this problem, current methods are limited to assessing discrete cell types, revealing the proportion of cell types inside each spot. To identify continuous variation of the transcriptome within cells of the same type, we developed Deconvolution of Spatial Transcriptomics profiles using Variational Inference (DestVI). Using simulations, we demonstrate that DestVI outperforms existing methods for estimating gene expression for every cell type inside every spot. Applied to a study of infected lymph nodes and of a mouse tumor model, DestVI provides high-resolution, accurate spatial characterization of the cellular organization of these tissues and identifies cell-type-specific changes in gene expression between different tissue regions or between conditions. DestVI is available as part of the open-source software package scvi-tools ( https://scvi-tools.org )."
https://openalex.org/W4224232972,"Neurons in the hippocampus exhibit a striking selectivity for specific combinations of sensory features, forming representations that are thought to subserve episodic memory. Even during completely novel experiences, hippocampal “place cells” are rapidly configured such that the population sparsely encodes visited locations, stabilizing within minutes of the first exposure to a new environment. What mechanisms enable this fast encoding of experience? Using virtual reality and neural population recordings in mice, we dissected the effects of novelty and experience on the dynamics of place field formation. During place field formation, many CA1 neurons immediately modulated the amplitude of their activity and shifted the location of their field, rapid changes in tuning predicted by behavioral timescale synaptic plasticity (BTSP). Signatures of BTSP were particularly enriched during the exploration of a novel context and decayed with experience. Our data suggest that novelty modulates the effective learning rate in CA1, favoring rapid mechanisms of field formation to encode a new experience."
https://openalex.org/W4224213096,"Abstract As animals explore an environment, the hippocampus is thought to automatically form and maintain a place code by combining sensory and self-motion signals. Instead, we observed an extensive degradation of the place code when mice voluntarily disengaged from a virtual navigation task, remarkably even as they continued to traverse the identical environment. Internal states, therefore, can strongly gate spatial maps and reorganize hippocampal activity even without sensory and self-motion changes."
https://openalex.org/W4226248812,"Fitness is at the core of evolutionary theory, but it is difficult to measure accurately. One way to measure long-term fitness is by calculating the individual's reproductive value, which represents the expected number of allele copies an individual passes on to distant future generations. However, this metric of fitness is scarcely used because the estimation of individual's reproductive value requires long-term pedigree data, which is rarely available in wild populations where following individuals from birth to death is often impossible. Wild study systems therefore use short-term fitness metrics as proxies, such as the number of offspring produced. This study compared two frequently used short-term metrics for fitness obtained at different offspring life stages (eggs, hatchlings, fledglings and recruits), and compared their ability to predict reproductive values derived from the genetic pedigree of a wild passerine bird population. We used twenty years of precise field observations and a near-complete genetic pedigree to calculate reproductive success, individual growth rate and de-lifed fitness as lifetime fitness measures, and as annual de-lifed fitness. We compared the power of these metrics to predict reproductive values and lineage survival to the end of the study period. The three short-term fitness proxies predict the reproductive values and lineage survival only when measured at the recruit stage. There were no significant differences between the different fitness proxies at the same offspring stages in predicting the reproductive values and lineage survival. Annual fitness at one year old predicted reproductive values equally well as lifetime de-lifed fitness. However, none of the short-term fitness proxies were strongly associated with the reproductive values. The commonly used short-term fitness proxies best predict long-term fitness when measured at recruitment stage. Thus, because lifetime fitness measured at recruit stage and annual fitness in the first year of life were the best proxies of long-term fitness in short-lived birds, we encourage their future use."
https://openalex.org/W4223939393,"G-quadruplex (G4)-prone structures are abundant in mammalian genomes, where they have been shown to influence DNA replication, transcription, and genome stability. In this article, we constructed cells with a single ectopic homopurine/homopyrimidine repeat tract derived from the polycystic kidney disease type 1 (PKD1) locus, which is capable of forming triplex (H3) and G4 DNA structures. We show that ligand stabilization of these G4 structures results in deletions of the G4 consensus sequence, as well as kilobase deletions spanning the G4 and ectopic sites. Furthermore, we show that DNA double-strand breaks at the ectopic site are dependent on the nuclease Mus81. Hypermutagenesis during sister chromatid repair extends several kilobases from the G4 site and breaks at the G4 site resulting in microhomology-mediated translocations. To determine whether H3 or G4 structures are responsible for homopurine/homopyrimidine tract instability, we derived constructs and cell lines from the PKD1 repeat, which can only form H3 or G4 structures. Under normal growth conditions, we found that G4 cell lines lost the G4 consensus sequence early during clonal outgrowth, whereas H3 cells showed DNA instability early during outgrowth but only lost reporter gene expression after prolonged growth. Thus, both the H3 and G4 non-B conformation DNAs exhibit genomic instability, but they respond differently to endogenous replication stress. Our results show that the outcomes of replication-dependent double-strand breaks at non-B-DNAs model the instability observed in microhomology-mediated break-induced replication (BIR). Marked variability in the frequency of mutagenesis during BIR suggests possible dynamic heterogeneity in the BIR replisome."
https://openalex.org/W4224211197,"It has been indicated that there is an association between inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) and hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). However, the molecular mechanism underlying the risk of developing HCC among patients with IBD is not well understood. The current study aimed to identify shared genes and potential pathways and regulators between IBD and HCC using a system biology approach. By performing the different gene expression analyses, we identified 871 common differentially expressed genes (DEGs) between IBD and HCC. Of these, 112 genes overlapped with immune genes were subjected to subsequent bioinformatics analyses. The results revealed four hub genes (CXCL2, MMP9, SPP1 and SRC) and several other key regulators including six transcription factors (FOXC1, FOXL1, GATA2, YY1, ZNF354C and TP53) and five microRNAs (miR-124-3p, miR-34a-5p, miR-1-3p, miR-7-5p and miR-99b-5p) for these disease networks. Protein-drug interaction analysis discovered the interaction of the hub genes with 46 SRC-related and 11 MMP9- related drugs that may have a therapeutic effect on IBD and HCC. In conclusion, this study sheds light on the potential connecting mechanisms of HCC and IBD."
https://openalex.org/W4224297192,"Access to low-frequency acoustic information in cochlear implant patients leads to better speech understanding in noise. Electrocochleography (ECochG) can provide real-time feedback about the health of the cochlea during the insertion process with the potential to reduce insertion trauma. We describe our experiences of using this technique. Data from 47 adult subjects with measurable residual hearing and an Advanced Bionics (Valencia, CA) SlimJ (46) or MidScala (1) electrode array were analyzed. ECochGs were recorded intraoperatively via the implant. The surgeon adjusted the course of the electrode insertion based on drops in the ECochG. The final array position was assessed using postoperative imaging and pure tone thresholds were measured before and after surgery. Three different patterns of ECochG response amplitude were observed: Growth, Fluctuating and Total Loss. Subjects in the growth group showed the smallest postoperative hearing loss. However, the group with fluctuating amplitudes showed no meaningful correlation between the ECochG responses and the postoperative hearing loss, indicating that amplitude alone is insufficient for detecting damage. Considering the phase of the signal additionally to the amplitude and reclassifying the data by both the phase and amplitude of the response into three groups Type I-Type III produced statistically significant correlations between postoperative hearing loss and the grouping based on amplitude and phase respectively. We showed significantly better hearing preservation for Type I (no drop in amplitude) and Type II (drop with a concurrent phase shift), while Type III (drop without concurrent phase shift) had more surgery induced hearing loss. ECochG potentials measured through the implant could provide valuable feedback during the electrode insertion. Both the amplitude and phase of the ECochG response are important to consider. More data needs to be evaluated to better understand the impact of the different signal components to design an automated system to alert the surgeon ahead of damaging the cochlea."
https://openalex.org/W4226056780,"Testing surfaces in school classrooms for the presence of SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes COVID-19, can provide public-health information that complements clinical testing. We monitored the presence of SARS-CoV-2 RNA in five schools (96 classrooms) in Davis, California (USA) by collecting weekly surface-swab samples from classroom floors and/or portable high-efficiency particulate air (HEPA) units (n = 2,341 swabs). Twenty-two surfaces tested positive, with qPCR cycle threshold (Ct) values ranging from 36.07-38.01. Intermittent repeated positives in a single room were observed for both floor and HEPA filter samples for up to 52 days, even following regular cleaning and HEPA filter replacement after a positive result. We compared the two environmental sampling strategies by testing one floor and two HEPA filter samples in 57 classrooms at Schools D and E. HEPA filter sampling yielded 3.02% and 0.41% positivity rates per filter sample collected for Schools D and E, respectively, while floor sampling yielded 0.48% and 0% positivity rates. Our results indicate that HEPA filter swabs are more sensitive than floor swabs at detecting SARS-CoV-2 RNA in interior spaces. During the study, all schools were offered weekly free COVID-19 clinical testing through Healthy Davis Together (HDT). HDT also offered on-site clinical testing in Schools D and E, and upticks in testing participation were observed following a confirmed positive environmental sample. However, no confirmed COVID-19 cases were identified among students associated with classrooms yielding positive environmental samples. The positive samples detected in this study appeared to contain relic viral RNA from individuals infected before the monitoring program started and/or RNA transported into classrooms via fomites. High-Ct positive results from environmental swabs detected in the absence of known active infections supports this conclusion. Additional research is needed to differentiate between fresh and relic SARS-CoV-2 RNA in environmental samples and to determine what types of results should trigger interventions."
https://openalex.org/W4223902575,"We recently demonstrated that GPR133 (ADGRD1), an adhesion G protein-coupled receptor involved in raising cytosolic cAMP levels, is necessary for growth of glioblastoma (GBM) and is de novo expressed in GBM relative to normal brain tissue. Our previous work suggested that dissociation of autoproteolytically generated N-terminal and C-terminal fragments of GPR133 at the plasma membrane correlates with receptor activation and signaling. To promote the goal of developing biologics that modulate GPR133 function, we investigated the effects of antibodies against the N-terminus of GPR133 on receptor signaling. Here, we show that treatment of HEK293T cells overexpressing GPR133 with these antibodies increased cAMP levels in a concentration-dependent manner. Analysis of culture medium following antibody treatment further indicated the presence of complexes of these antibodies with the autoproteolytically cleaved N-terminal fragments of GPR133. In addition, cells expressing a cleavage-deficient mutant of GPR133 (H543R) did not respond to antibody stimulation, suggesting that the effect is cleavage dependent. Finally, we demonstrate the antibody-mediated stimulation of WT GPR133, but not the cleavage-deficient H543R mutant, was reproducible in patient-derived GBM cells. These findings provide a paradigm for modulation of GPR133 function with biologics and support the hypothesis that the intramolecular cleavage in the N-terminus modulates receptor activation and signaling."
https://openalex.org/W4224234601,"Asparagine-linked glycosylation (N-glycosylation) of proteins in the cancer secretome has been gaining increasing attention as a potential biomarker for cancer detection and diagnosis. Small extracellular vesicles (sEVs) constitute a large part of the cancer secretome, yet little is known about whether their N-glycosylation status reflects known cancer characteristics. Here, we investigated the N-glycosylation of sEVs released from small-cell lung carcinoma (SCLC) and non-small-cell lung carcinoma (NSCLC) cells. We found that the N-glycans of SCLC-sEVs were characterized by the presence of structural units also found in the brain N-glycome, while NSCLC-sEVs were dominated by typical lung-type N-glycans with NSCLC-associated core fucosylation. In addition, lectin-assisted N-glycoproteomics of SCLC-sEVs and NSCLC-sEVs revealed that integrin αV was commonly expressed in sEVs of both cancer cell types, while the epithelium-specific integrin α6β4 heterodimer was selectively expressed in NSCLC-sEVs. Importantly, N-glycomics of the immunopurified integrin α6 from NSCLC-sEVs identified NSCLC-type N-glycans on this integrin subunit. Thus, we conclude that protein N-glycosylation in lung cancer sEVs may potentially reflect the histology of lung cancers."
https://openalex.org/W4224285664,"Models can be applied to extrapolate consequences of climate change for complex ecological systems in the future. The acknowledged systems’ behaviour at present is projected into the future considering climate projection data. Such an approach can be used to addresses the future activity and density of the castor bean tick Ixodes ricinus , the most widespread tick species in Europe. It is an important vector of pathogens causing Lyme borreliosis and tick-borne encephalitis. The population dynamics depend on several biotic and abiotic factors. Such complexity makes it difficult to predict the future dynamics and density of I . ricinus and associated health risk for humans. The objective of this study is to force ecological models with high-resolution climate projection data to extrapolate I . ricinus tick density and activity patterns into the future. We used climate projection data of temperature, precipitation, and relative humidity for the period 1971–2099 from 15 different climate models. Tick activity was investigated using a climate-driven cohort-based population model. We simulated the seasonal population dynamics using climate data between 1971 and 2099 and observed weather data since 1949 at a specific location in southern Germany. We evaluated derived quantities of local tick ecology, e.g. the maximum questing activity of the nymphal stage. Furthermore, we predicted spatial density changes by extrapolating a German-wide tick density model. We compared the tick density of the reference period (1971–2000) with the counter-factual densities under the near-term scenario (2012–2041), mid-term scenario (2050–2079) and long-term scenario (2070–2099). We found that the nymphal questing peak would shift towards early seasons of the year. Also, we found high spatial heterogeneity across Germany, with predicted hotspots of up to 2,000 nymphs per 100 m 2 and coldspots with constant density. As our results suggest extreme changes in tick behaviour and density, we discuss why caution is needed when extrapolating climate data-driven models into the distant future when data on future climate drive the model projection."
https://openalex.org/W4223905221,"Cytokinesis in the early divergent protozoan Trypanosoma brucei occurs from the anterior cell tip of the new-flagellum daughter toward the nascent posterior end of the old-flagellum daughter of a dividing biflagellated cell. The cleavage furrow ingresses unidirectionally along the preformed cell division fold and is regulated by an orphan kinesin named kinesin localized to the ingressing furrow (KLIF) that localizes to the leading edge of the ingressing furrow. Little is known about how furrow ingression is controlled by KLIF and whether KLIF interacts with and cooperates with other cytokinesis regulatory proteins to promote furrow ingression. Here, we investigated the roles of KLIF in cleavage furrow ingression and identified a cohort of KLIF-associated cytoskeletal proteins as essential cytokinesis regulators. By genetic complementation, we demonstrated the requirement of the kinesin motor activity, but not the putative tropomyosin domain, of KLIF in promoting furrow ingression. We further showed that depletion of KLIF impaired the resolution of the nascent posterior of the old-flagellar daughter cell, thereby stalking cleavage furrow ingression at late stages of cytokinesis. Through proximity biotinylation, we identified a subset of cytoskeleton-associated proteins (CAPs) as KLIF-proximal proteins, and functional characterization of these cytoskeletal proteins revealed the essential roles of CAP46 and CAP52 in positioning the cleavage furrow and the crucial roles of CAP42 and CAP50 in promoting cleavage furrow ingression. Together, these results identified multiple cytoskeletal proteins as cytokinesis regulators and uncovered their essential and distinct roles in cytokinesis."
https://openalex.org/W4224306473,"β-Mannans are a heterogeneous group of polysaccharides with a common main chain of β-1,4-linked mannopyranoside residues. The cleavage of β-mannan chains is catalyzed by glycoside hydrolases called β-mannanases. In the CAZy database, β-mannanases are grouped by sequence similarity in families GH5, GH26, GH113 and GH134. Family GH113 has been under-explored so far with six enzymes characterized, all from the Firmicutes phylum. We undertook the functional characterization of 14 enzymes from a selection of 31 covering the diversity of the family GH113. Our observations suggest that GH113 is a family with specificity towards mannans, with variations in the product profiles and modes of action. We were able to assign mannanase and mannosidase activities to four out of the five clades of the family, increasing by 200% the number of characterized GH113 members, and expanding the toolbox for fine-tuning of mannooligosaccharides."
https://openalex.org/W4226018342,"The study of lithic raw material quality has become one of the major interpretive tools to investigate the raw material selection behaviour and its influence to the knapping technology. In order to make objective assessments of raw material quality, we need to measure their mechanical properties (e.g., fracture resistance, hardness, modulus of elasticity). However, such comprehensive investigations are lacking for the Palaeolithic of Kazakhstan. In this work, we investigate geological and archaeological lithic raw material samples of chert, porphyry, and shale collected from the Inner Asian Mountain Corridor (henceforth IAMC). Selected samples of aforementioned rocks were tested by means of Vickers and Knoop indentation methods to determine the main aspect of their mechanical properties: their indentation fracture resistance (a value closely related to fracture toughness). These tests were complemented by traditional petrographic studies to characterise the mineralogical composition and evaluate the level of impurities that could have potentially affected the mechanical properties. The results show that materials, such as porphyry possess fracture toughness values that can be compared to those of chert. Previously, porphyry was thought to be of lower quality due to the anisotropic composition and coarse feldspar and quartz phenocrysts embedded in a silica rich matrix. However, our analysis suggests that different raw materials are not different in terms of indentation fracture resistance. This work also offers first insight into the quality of archaeological porphyry that was utilised as a primary raw material at various Upper Palaeolithic sites in the Inner Asian Mountain Corridor from 47–21 ka cal BP."
https://openalex.org/W4224218566,"Extracellular small RNAs (sRNAs) are abundant in many biofluids, but little is known about their mechanisms of transport and stability in RNase-rich environments. We previously reported that high-density lipoproteins (HDLs) in mice were enriched with multiple classes of sRNAs derived from the endogenous transcriptome, but also from exogenous organisms. Here, we show that human HDL transports tRNA-derived sRNAs (tDRs) from host and nonhost species, the profiles of which were found to be altered in human atherosclerosis. We hypothesized that HDL binds to tDRs through apolipoprotein A-I (apoA-I) and that these interactions are conferred by RNA-specific features. We tested this using microscale thermophoresis and electrophoretic mobility shift assays and found that HDL binds to tDRs and other single-stranded sRNAs with strong affinity but did not bind to double-stranded RNA or DNA. Furthermore, we show that natural and synthetic RNA modifications influenced tDR binding to HDL. We demonstrate that reconstituted HDL bound to tDRs only in the presence of apoA-I, and purified apoA-I alone were able to bind sRNA. Conversely, phosphatidylcholine vesicles did not bind tDRs. In summary, we conclude that HDL binds to single-stranded sRNAs likely through nonionic interactions with apoA-I. These results highlight binding properties that likely enable extracellular RNA communication and provide a foundation for future studies to manipulate HDL–sRNA interactions for therapeutic approaches to prevent or treat disease.

Bioinformatic analysis of endogenous and exogenous small RNAs on lipoproteins.J. Extracell. Vesicles. 2018; 7: 1506198Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). Recently, we profiled HDL–sRNAs in mice using high-throughput sRNA sequencing, and many classes of host and nonhost sRNAs were identified on circulating HDL (7Allen R.M. Zhao S.

Extracell. Vesicles. 2018; 7: 1506198Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). Results showed that HDL also transport tRNA-derived sRNAs (tDRs) and rRNA-derived sRNAs (rDRs) (7Allen R.M. Zhao S.

Furthermore, we found that mouse HDLs are highly enriched with nonhost microbial sRNAs which likely originate from bacteria and fungi in the microbiome, environment, and/or diet. HDL–sRNAs are likely single-stranded and generally <60 nts in length (7Allen R.M. Zhao S. Ramirez Solano M.A. Zhu W. Michell D.L. Wang Y. Shyr Y. Sethupathy P. Linton M.F. Graf G.A. Sheng Q.

Rep. 2019; 9: 3803Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). Nevertheless, the mechanism by which HDL acquires sRNAs from donor cells and the underlying biochemistry of HDL–sRNA binding have remained elusive. Studies suggest that oligonucleotides can associate with zwitterionic lipids, e.g., phosphatidylcholine (PC) (22Gromelski S. Brezesinski G.

Results from HDL delipidation studies suggest that miRNAs may bind to HDL proteins as opposed to phospholipids (13Axmann M. Meier S.M. Karner A. Strobl W. Stangl H. Plochberger B.

Here, we tested the hypothesis that apoA-I is a novel RNA binding protein for single-stranded sRNAs, specifically tDRs. Microscale thermophoresis (MST) and electrophoretic mobility shift assay (EMSA) data suggest that apoA-I is a novel ribonucleoprotein that likely confers the ability of HDL to bind RNA, rather than the lipid cargo of the particle. MST approaches were used to define the impact of base modifications and the 2′ hydroxyl group on HDL–sRNA binding. These results support a mechanism by which HDL binds sRNAs, including tDRs, and reveal the physicochemical properties that influence HDL–sRNA binding. The determination of overall total RNA content on human HDL particles has previously been challenging due to technical limitations that require RNA isolation and downstream quantitation of individual candidate sRNAs of prior knowledge. To overcome these barriers, total RNA levels were quantified in intact human HDL with SYTO RNASelect, a fluorescence-based membrane-penetrating RNA dye that does not require RNA isolation (27Herster F. Bittner Z. Archer N.K. Dickhöfer S. Eisel D. Eigenbrod T. Knorpp T. Schneiderhan-Marra N. Löffler M.W. Kalbacher H. Vierbuchen T. Heine H. Miller L.S. Hartl D. Freund L. et al.Neutrophil extracellular trap-associated RNA and LL37 enable self-amplifying inflammation in psoriasis.Nat. Commun. 2020; 11: 105Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). HDLs were isolated from healthy controls (control, mean=0, N = 46) and subjects with indications of atherosclerosis (coronary artery calcium [CAC], mean=61, n = 21) (Fig. 1A and Table S1). Based on an oligoribonucleotide standard curve, HDL particles were determined to transport about 128 μg of total RNA per mg HDL total protein for healthy control subjects (n = 16) and 125 μg total RNA per mg HDL total protein for CAC subjects (n = 11) (Fig. 1B). In both control and CAC subjects, density-gradient ultracentrifugation (DGUC)-HDL total cholesterol (TC) levels were significantly correlated to HDL–RNA (Fig. 1C). HDL–apoA-I protein levels were also found to be significantly correlated to HDL–RNA levels in control subjects, but not CAC subjects (Figs. 1D, S1, A and B). Host miRNAs are only a minor fraction of HDL–sRNA cargo and further investigation of non-miRNA classes for content and function are warranted. tDRs are associated with cellular stress and likely function as sRNA regulators of cell survival and protein synthesis (28Dhahbi J.M.

To define the human HDL–tDR profile and quantify differences in HDL–tDR levels in atherosclerosis (CAC versus control), sRNA-seq and informatics (TIGER pipeline) were performed (7Allen R.M. Zhao S. Ramirez Solano M.A. Zhu W. Michell D.L. Wang Y. Shyr Y. Sethupathy P. Linton M.F. Graf G.A. Sheng Q. Vickers K.C. Bioinformatic analysis of endogenous and exogenous small RNAs on lipoproteins.J. Extracell. Vesicles. 2018; 7: 1506198Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). Preprocessed reads from HDL–sRNA-seq were aligned to the human reference genome (hg19) as well as to additional parent tRNA transcripts not present in the reference genome (7Allen R.M. Zhao S. Ramirez Solano M.A. Zhu W. Michell D.L. Wang Y. Shyr Y. Sethupathy P. Linton M.F. Graf G.A. Sheng Q. Vickers K.C. Bioinformatic analysis of endogenous and exogenous small RNAs on lipoproteins.J. Extracell. Vesicles. 2018; 7: 1506198Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). Special considerations were made for tRNA nomenclature, multimapping, and terminal 3′ CCA masking; and tDR read counts were tabulated for parent tRNAs at the amino acid anticodon level, as well as individually at the read level (7Allen R.M. Zhao S. Ramirez Solano M.A. Zhu W. Michell D.L. Wang Y. Shyr Y. Sethupathy P. Linton M.F. Graf G.A. Sheng Q. Vickers K.C. Bioinformatic analysis of endogenous and exogenous small RNAs on lipoproteins.J. Extracell. Vesicles. 2018; 7: 1506198Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). The most abundant class of host (human) sRNAs on DGUC-HDL were rDRs, followed by yDRs (Y RNA–derived sRNAs), miRNAs, and tDRs (Fig. 1E). Differential expression analyses (DEseq2) were used to identify altered HDL–sRNAs and multiple miRNAs, rDRs, and tDRs were found to be significantly increased or decreased on HDL from human atherosclerotic subjects (CAC) compared to control subjects (Fig. S1C and Tables S2–S5). Summary counts for parent tRNA-GlyGCC were the highest on human HDL, followed by tRNA-GluCTC and tRNA-LysCTT (Fig. 1F and Table S2). Multiple tDRs were observed to be significantly altered in human atherosclerosis at the individual sRNA level, as opposed to the parent transcript level (Table S3). For example, HDL levels of tDR-GlyGCC-30, a 30 nt tDR processed from the 5′ half of parent tRNA-GlyGCC, were increased 3.5-fold (p = 0.0012) on HDL from CAC subjects compared to control subjects (Fig. 1G and Table S3). In our previous study, mouse HDL were demonstrated to transport many nonhost sRNAs, including microbial sRNAs, not from laboratory contamination, but indeed from bacteria and fungi in the microbiome and environment (7Allen R.M. Zhao S. Ramirez Solano M.A. Zhu W. Michell D.L. Wang Y. Shyr Y. Sethupathy P. Linton M.F. Graf G.A. Sheng Q. Vickers K.C. Bioinformatic analysis of endogenous and exogenous small RNAs on lipoproteins.J. Extracell. Vesicles. 2018; 7: 1506198Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). To determine if human HDL also transport microbial sRNA, all nonhost reads were further aligned to curated nonhost genomes, including bacteria, fungi, and viruses. Strikingly, we found that DGUC-HDL from human plasma are also highly enriched with nonhost microbial sRNAs (Fig. 1H). To determine if HDL transports nonhuman tDRs, nonhost reads were further aligned to a database of tRNA transcripts (GtRNAdb), and human HDL were observed to carry many bacterial tDRs (Fig.1I and Table S6). Interestingly, many nonhost tDRs aligned to bacterial tRNAs curated in the GtRNAdb database (38Chan P.P. Lowe T.M. GtRNAdb 2.0: An expanded database of transfer RNA genes identified in complete and draft genomes.Nucl. Acids Res. 2016; 44: D184-D189Crossref PubMed Scopus (378) Google Scholar), as reported at the species (count) level (Fig. 1J and Table S6). Nonetheless, host tDR-GlyGCC-30 was still found to be one of the most altered sRNAs on HDL in subjects with CAC. These results support the notion that human HDL transports high levels of sRNA in circulation, and HDL–sRNA levels are correlated to HDL-cholesterol and apoA-I levels. Moreover, results support the notion that human HDL transports specific tDRs which are altered in atherosclerosis; however, the mechanism by which HDL binds to tDRs is unknown. We have previously observed that macrophages and other immune cells readily export miRNAs to HDL in vitro (8Vickers K.C. Palmisano B.T. Shoucri B.M. Shamburek R.D. Remaley A.T.

Cellular tDR changes are associated with stress and macrophages within the atherosclerotic lesion are under both environmental (local tissue inflammation) and metabolic stresses (cholesterol-loading endoplasmic reticulum stress) (29Fu H. Feng J. Liu Q. Sun F. Tie Y. Zhu J. Xing R. Sun Z. Zheng X.

Med. 2009; 15: 1383-1391Crossref PubMed Scopus (382) Google Scholar). To determine if macrophages export tDRs to HDL, CD14+ human peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) were isolated from whole blood, differentiated to macrophages for 7 days with GM-CSF (50 ng/ml), and incubated with 1 mg/ml DGUC-HDL for 24 h in serum-free media (Fig. 2A). HDL were repurified from culture media by size-exclusion chromatography (SEC), and total RNA was isolated from equal protein levels (0.2 mg HDL total protein) of HDL preincubation and postincubation with macrophages. To quantify tDR-GlyGCC-30 export, qPCR with custom probes were performed, and we observed an increase in HDL-tDR-GlyGCC-30 levels on post-HDL compared to pre-HDL (Fig. 2B). To confirm macrophage HDL–tDR export, mouse bone marrow cells were differentiated to bone marrow–derived macrophages (BMDM) with GM-CSF for 7 days, transiently-transfected for 24 h with fluorescence-labeled tDR-GlyGCC-30-AF647, washed, and incubated with accepting HDL (1 mg/ml) for 24 h (Fig. 2C). BMDM culture media was collected and separated by SEC, and HDL-tDR-GlyGCC-30 export was determined by the levels of fluorescence (tDR-GlyGCC) in HDL (SEC) fractions. We observed a significant increase in fluorescence signal in fractions corresponding to HDL compared to media from wells that did not receive accepting HDL (Fig. 2, D and E). These results suggest that primary macrophages in both humans and mice have the capacity to export tDRs, namely tDR-GlyGCC-30, to HDL in vitro. Although the mechanism by which HDL accepts tDRs from macrophages is unknown, HDL may have the capacity to bind to free, unprotected extracellular tDRs exported from macrophages. To quantify the binding affinity of sRNAs to HDL, MST assays were completed with oligonucleotides labeled with a 3′ terminal fluorophore (Alexa Fluor 647) (Fig. 3, A and B and Table S7). As a positive control, the binding affinity of tDR-GlyGCC-30 to its complementary antisense (AS) sequence was tested, and strong affinity toward AS-GlyGCC-30 was observed (Fig. 3C). tDR-GlyGCC-30 binding to a control scrambled sequence (AS-Scr) was also assayed as a negative control, and tDR-GlyGCC-30 binding was not observed (Fig. 3C). To calculate HDL’s binding affinity to tDR-GlyGCC-30, multiple DGUC-HDL samples were tested with MST, and we found that HDL does indeed have strong affinity toward tDR-GlyGCC-30 (Fig. 3D). To determine if HDL has similar affinity to other tDRs of same length (30 nts), MST assays were used to calculate HDL affinities toward tDR-LysCTT-30 and tDR-GlyCCC-30, both of which were found to have reduced affinity toward HDL compared to tDR-GlyGCC-30 (Fig. 3E). These results suggest that HDL have preferential binding toward tDR-GlyGCC-30 compared to other HDL-tDRs. Based on informatics, HDL-sRNAs are likely single-stranded RNA (ssRNA); however, tDR-GlyGCC has been reported to form secondary hairpin structures that have been proposed to increase its stability and resistance to RNases in plasma (40Tosar J.P.

The SMART intervention consisted of one mandatory two-hour in-person workshop and an optional 24-week online program, designed to support the materials delivered in the workshop. Outcome measures were assessed using validated scales administered online at baseline and at 3-months and 6-months follow-up.After adjusting for baseline levels of each outcome, no statistically significant intervention effect was observed for resilience, subjective happiness, stress or anxiety at 3-months or 6-months follow-up. However, physicians in the intervention group demonstrated improvements in resilience, stress and anxiety at follow-up that were within the range of clinically relevant differences.The findings of this exploratory study provide modest support that the SMART intervention may be beneficial for proactively addressing physician wellness during the implementation of a new HIS and that larger randomized trials are warranted.NCT04384861."

https://openalex.org/W4224292546,"The development of new drugs is a very complex and time-consuming process, and for this reason, researchers have been resorting heavily to drug repurposing techniques as an alternative for the treatment of various diseases. This approach is especially interesting when it comes to emerging diseases with high rates of infection, because the lack of a quickly cure brings many human losses until the mitigation of the epidemic, as is the case of COVID-19. In this work, we combine an in-house developed machine learning strategy with docking, MM-PBSA calculations, and metadynamics to detect potential inhibitors for SARS-COV-2 main protease among FDA approved compounds. To assess the ability of our machine learning strategy to retrieve potential compounds we calculated the Enrichment Factor of compound datasets for three well known protein targets: HIV-1 reverse transcriptase (PDB 4B3P), 5-HT2A serotonin receptor (PDB 6A94), and H1 histamine receptor (PDB 3RZE). The Enrichment Factor for each target was, respectively, 102.5, 12.4, 10.6, which are considered significant values. Regarding the identification of molecules that can potentially inhibit the main protease of SARS-COV-2, compounds output by the machine learning step went through a docking experiment against SARS-COV-2 M pro . The best scored poses were the input for MM-PBSA calculations and metadynamics using CHARMM and AMBER force fields to predict the binding energy for each complex. Our work points out six molecules, highlighting the strong interaction obtained for M pro -mirabegron complex. Among these six, to the best of our knowledge, ambenonium has not yet been described in the literature as a candidate inhibitor for the SARS-COV-2 main protease in its active pocket."
https://openalex.org/W4225814340,"TLR7 and TLR8 are key members of the Toll-like receptor family, playing crucial roles in the signaling pathways of innate immunity, and thus become attractive therapeutic targets of many diseases including infections and cancer. Although TLR7 and TLR8 show a high degree of sequence homology, their biological response to small molecule binding is very different. Aiming to understand the mechanism of selective profiles of small molecule modulators against TLR7 and TLR8, we carried out molecular dynamic simulations on three imidazoquinoline derivatives bound to the receptors separately. They are Resiquimod (R), Hybrid-2 (H), and Gardiquimod (G), selective agonists of TLR7 and TLR8. Our MD trajectories indicated that in the complex of TLR7-R and TLR7-G, the two chains forming the TLR7 dimer tended to remain ""open"" conformation, while the rest systems maintained in the closed format. The agonists R, H, and G developed conformational deviation mainly on the aliphatic tail. Furthermore, we attempted to quantify the selectivity between TLR7 and TLR8 by binding free energies via MM-GBSA method. It showed that the three selected modulators were more favorable for TLR7 than TLR8, and the ranking from the strongest to the weakest was H, R and G, aligning well with experimental data. In the TLR7, the flexible and hydrophobic aliphatic side chain of H has stronger van der Waals interactions with V381 and F351 but only pick up interaction with one amino acid residue i.e. Y353 of TLR8. Unsurprisingly, the positively charged side chain of G has less favorable interaction with I585 of TLR7 and V573 of TLR8 explaining G is weak agonist of both TLR7 and TLR8. All three imidazoquinoline derivatives can form stable hydrogen bonds with D555 of TLR7 and the corresponding D543 of TLR8. In brief, the set of total 400ns MD studies sheds light on the potential selectivity mechanisms of agonists towards TLR7 and TLR8, indicating the van der Waals interaction as the driving force for the agonists binding, thus provides us insights for designing more potent and selective modulators to cooperate with the hydrophobic nature of the binding pocket."
https://openalex.org/W4224211429,"The physiological role played by uncoupling protein 3 (UCP3) in white adipose tissue (WAT) has not been elucidated so far. In the present study, we evaluated the impact of the absence of the whole body UCP3 on WAT physiology in terms of ability to store triglycerides, oxidative capacity, response to insulin, inflammation, and adipokine production. Wild type (WT) and UCP3 Knockout (KO) mice housed at thermoneutrality (30°C) have been used as the animal model. Visceral gonadic WAT (gWAT) from KO mice showed an impaired capacity to store triglycerides (TG) as indicated by its lowered weight, reduced adipocyte diameter, and higher glycerol release (index of lipolysis). The absence of UCP3 reduces the maximal oxidative capacity of gWAT, increases mitochondrial free radicals, and activates ER stress. These processes are associated with increased levels of monocyte chemoattractant protein-1 and TNF-α. The response of gWAT to in vivo insulin administration, revealed by (ser473)-AKT phosphorylation, was blunted in KO mice, with a putative role played by eif2a, JNK, and inflammation. Variations in adipokine levels in the absence of UCP3 were observed, including reduced adiponectin levels both in gWAT and serum. As a whole, these data indicate an important role of UCP3 in regulating the metabolic functionality of gWAT, with its absence leading to metabolic derangement. The obtained results help to clarify some aspects of the association between metabolic disorders and low UCP3 levels."
https://openalex.org/W4224226325,"The Ordinary Kriging method is a common spatial interpolation algorithm in geostatistics. Because the semivariogram required for kriging interpolation greatly influences this process, optimal fitting of the semivariogram is of major significance for improving the theoretical accuracy of spatial interpolation. A deep neural network is a machine learning algorithm that can, in principle, be applied to any function, including a semivariogram. Accordingly, a novel spatial interpolation method based on a deep neural network and Ordinary Kriging was proposed in this research, and elevation data were used as a case study. Compared with the semivariogram fitted by the traditional exponential model, spherical model, and Gaussian model, the kriging variance in the proposed method is smaller, which means that the interpolation results are closer to the theoretical results of Ordinary Kriging interpolation. At the same time, this research can simplify processes for a variety of semivariogram analyses."
https://openalex.org/W4224287679,"Intrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma (ICC) has a poor prognosis, as the resectability rate is low due to its diagnosis at a late/advanced stage. Moreover, most patients with resected ICC eventually relapse. Hepatic arterial infusion chemotherapy (HAIC) has been indicated only by a few reports to be effective in patients with advanced ICC; thus, its efficacy for these patients remains unclear. This study aimed to evaluate the efficacy of HAIC using gemcitabine, cisplatin, and 5-fluorouracil in patients with advanced ICC. A total of 18 patients who underwent HAIC were retrospectively investigated. The patients received gemcitabine, cisplatin, and 5-fluorouracil through one artery. In patients who received gemcitabine plus cisplatin ( n = 10), the response and disease control rates were 0% and 80.0%, respectively; the median overall survival (OS) and progression-free survival (PFS) after treatment initiation were 6.3 and 3.7 months, respectively. In patients who never received chemotherapy ( n = 8), the response and disease control rates were 37.5% and 75%, respectively; the median OS and PFS were 20.6 and 8.1 months, respectively. Moreover, we compared the patients who received HAIC using gemcitabine, cisplatin, and 5-fluorouracil to patients whose tumors were refractory to systemic gemcitabine and cisplatin therapy. The OS of the patients who received HAIC was better than that of the patients who received standard chemotherapy cohort since the gemcitabine plus cisplatin combination therapy-refractory response and disease onset ( P = 0.045, 0.006). HAIC using gemcitabine, cisplatin, and 5-fluorouracil may be effective as a therapeutic option for patients with advanced ICC."
https://openalex.org/W4224289755,"As a result of the significance of childbearing in the Ghanaian culture, couples would go to all lengths to have biological children. One of the means that has made it possible for childless couples to have children is through the use of various assisted reproductive technologies. Using a qualitative research design, the paper explores the experiences of 40 women who have delivered following the use of assisted reproductive technology in Ghana. A semi-structured interview guide was utilised to explore women's experiences and results were analysed thematically. The study revealed that childless women faced hostile treatment but the birth of a child ceased the hostility, giving couples social recognition. The study also revealed that the transition to motherhood is characterised by excitement, high self-esteem, recognition and acceptance into spouses' families. It was a source of anxiety for other women due to society's perception of children born following the use of assisted reproductive technologies. However, women perceived that having a second or third child could change society's perception about the use of assisted reproductive technologies to have children. Based on these assumptions, there is a need for public education to change the societal perception about women who utilise assisted reproductive technologies to meet their parenthood desires as well as children who are born following the use of assisted reproductive technologies."
https://openalex.org/W4224293368,"Introduction HIV co-infection with hepatitis B (HIV-HBV) and hepatitis C (HIV-HCV) is known to affect treatment outcomes of antiretroviral therapy (ART); however, its magnitude is not well documented. We aimed to determine the magnitude of HIV-HBV and HIV-HCV co-infections simultaneously in people living with HIV (PLHIV) enrolled in ART care in Addis Ababa. Methods We reviewed the medical records of adults ≥15 years who were receiving ART care in three high burden hospitals in Addis Ababa. Baseline clinical and laboratory test results were extracted from medical records. Co-infection was determined based on hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg) and hepatitis C virus antibody (anti-HCV) tests obtained from the medical records. A multivariable logistic regression model was used to identify the risk factors for hepatitis B and C co-infections. Results A total of 873 HIV-positive participants were included in this study. The median age of the participants was 37.5 years, and 55.7% were women. Overall, HIV-HBV co-infection was 5.96% (95% CI: 4.56–7.74), and HIV-HCV co-infection was 1.72% (95% CI: 1.03–2.83). The multivariable logistic regression showed that the male sex was the most independent predictor for viral hepatitis B co-infection with an odds ratio of 2.42(95% CI:1.27–4.63). However, HIV-HCV co-infection did not show a significant association in any of the sociodemographic data of the participants. Conclusion HIV co-infection with hepatitis B was moderately high in individuals enrolled in ART care in Addis Ababa. Men had significantly higher HIV-HBV co-infection. HIV co-infection with hepatitis C was relatively low. Strengthening integrated viral hepatitis services with HIV care and treatment services should be emphasized to improve patient care in health facilities."
https://openalex.org/W4223943508,"Nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) is one of the most common chronic liver diseases worldwide. However, the molecular mechanisms that promote dysregulation of hepatic triglyceride metabolism and lead to NAFLD are poorly understood, and effective treatments are limited. Leukemia inhibitory factor (LIF) is a member of the interleukin-6 cytokine family and has been shown to regulate a variety of physiological processes, although its role in hepatic triglyceride metabolism remains unknown. In the present study, we measured circulating LIF levels by ELISA in 214 patients with biopsy-diagnosed NAFLD as well as 314 normal control patients. We further investigated the potential role and mechanism of LIF on hepatic lipid metabolism in obese mice. We found that circulating LIF levels correlated with the severity of liver steatosis. Patients with ballooning, fibrosis, lobular inflammation, and abnormally elevated liver injury markers alanine transaminase and aspartate aminotransferase also had higher levels of serum LIF than control patients. Furthermore, animal studies showed that white adipose tissue-derived LIF could ameliorate liver steatosis through activation of hepatic LIF receptor signaling pathways. Together, our results suggested that targeting LIF-LIF receptor signaling might be a promising strategy for treating NAFLD."
https://openalex.org/W4224013298,"Inorganic phosphate is essential for human life. The widely expressed mammalian sodium/phosphate cotransporter SLC20A1/PiT1 mediates phosphate uptake into most cell types; however, while SLC20A1 is required for development, and elevated SLC20A1 expression is associated with vascular calcification and aggressive tumor growth, the mechanisms regulating SLC20A1 protein abundance are unknown. Here, we found that SLC20A1 protein expression is low in phosphate-replete cultured cells but is strikingly induced following phosphate starvation, whereas mRNA expression is high in phosphate-replete cells and only mildly increased by phosphate starvation. To identify regulators of SLC20A1 protein levels, we performed a genome-wide CRISPR-based loss-of-function genetic screen in phosphate-replete cells using SLC20A1 protein induction as readout. Our screen revealed that endosomal sorting complexes required for transport (ESCRT) machinery was essential for proper SLC20A1 protein downregulation in phosphate-replete cells. We show that SLC20A1 colocalizes with ESCRT and that ESCRT deficiency increases SLC20A1 protein and phosphate uptake into cells. We also found numerous additional candidate regulators of mammalian phosphate homeostasis, including genes modifying protein ubiquitination and the Krebs cycle and oxidative phosphorylation pathways. Many of these targets have not been previously implicated in this process. We present here a model in which SLC20A1 protein abundance and phosphate uptake are tonically negatively regulated post-transcriptionally in phosphate-replete cells through direct ESCRT-mediated SLC20A1 degradation. Moreover, our screening results provide a comprehensive resource for future studies to elucidate the mechanisms governing cellular phosphate homeostasis. We conclude that genome-wide CRISPR-based genetic screening is a powerful tool to discover proteins and pathways relevant to physiological processes."
https://openalex.org/W4224212396,"Recordings of calls may be used to assess population structure for acoustic species. This can be particularly effective if there are identity calls, produced nearly exclusively by just one population segment. The identity call method, IDcall, classifies calls into types using contaminated mixture models, and then clusters repertoires of calls into identity clades (potential population segments) using identity calls that are characteristic of the repertoires in each identity clade. We show how to calculate the Bayesian posterior probabilities that each repertoire is a member of each identity clade, and display this information as a stacked bar graph. This methodology (IDcallPP) is introduced using the output of IDcall but could easily be adapted to estimate posterior probabilities of clade membership when acoustic clades are delineated using other methods. This output is similar to that of the STRUCTURE software which uses molecular genetic data to assess population structure and has become a standard in conservation genetics. The technique introduced here should be a valuable asset to those who use acoustic data to address evolution, ecology, or conservation, and creates a methodological and conceptual bridge between geneticists and acousticians who aim to assess population structure."
https://openalex.org/W4224232006,"Although Ethiopia had made a significant change in maternal morbidity and mortality over the past decades, it remains a major public health concern. World Health Organization designed maternal continuum of care to reduce maternal morbidity and mortality. However, majority of the mothers didn't utilize the maternal continuum of care. Therefore, this study aimed to assess the spatial distribution of incomplete utilization of maternal continuum of care and its associated factors in Ethiopia.This study was based on 2016 Demographic and Health Survey data of Ethiopia. A total weighted sample of 4,772 reproductive aged women were included. The study used ArcGIS and SaTScan software to explore the spatial distribution of incomplete utilization of maternal continuum of care. Besides, multivariable Generalized Estimating Equation was fitted to identify the associated factors of incomplete utilization of maternal continuum of care using STATA software. Model comparison was made based on Quasi Information Criteria. An adjusted odds ratio with 95% confidence interval of the selected model was reported to identify significantly associated factors of incomplete utilization of maternal continuum of care.The spatial analysis revealed that incomplete utilization of maternal continuum of care had significant spatial variation across the country. Primary clusters were detected at Somali, North-Eastern part of Oromia, and East part of Southern Nation Nationalities while secondary clusters were detected in the Central Amhara region. In multivariate GEE, rural residency, secondary education, higher education, Protestant religious follower's, Muslim religious follower's, poorer wealth index, richer wealth index, richest wealth index, currently working, having barriers for accessing health care, and exposure for mass media were significantly associated with incomplete utilization maternal continuum of care.Incomplete utilization of maternal continuum of care had significant spatial variations in Ethiopia. Residence, wealth index, education, religion, and barriers for health care access, mass media exposure, and currently working were significantly associated with incomplete utilization of maternal continuum of care. Therefore, public health interventions targeted to enhance maternal service utilization and women empowerment in hotspot areas of incomplete utilization of maternal continuum of care are crucial for reducing maternal morbidity and mortality."
https://openalex.org/W4224247855,"Free amino acids that accumulate in the plasma of patients with diabetes and obesity influence lipid metabolism and protein synthesis in the liver. The stress-inducible intracellular protease calpain proteolyzes various substrates in vascular endothelial cells (ECs), although its contribution to the supply of free amino acids in the liver microenvironment remains enigmatic. In the present study, we showed that calpains are associated with free amino acid production in cultured ECs. Furthermore, conditioned media derived from calpain-activated ECs facilitated the phosphorylation of ribosomal protein S6 kinase (S6K) and de novo lipogenesis in hepatocytes, which were abolished by the amino acid transporter inhibitor, JPH203, and the mammalian target of rapamycin complex 1 inhibitor, rapamycin. Meanwhile, calpain-overexpressing capillary-like ECs were observed in the livers of high-fat diet-fed mice. Conditional KO of EC/hematopoietic Capns1, which encodes a calpain regulatory subunit, diminished levels of branched-chain amino acids in the hepatic microenvironment without altering plasma amino acid levels. Concomitantly, conditional KO of Capns1 mitigated hepatic steatosis without normalizing body weight and the plasma lipoprotein profile in an amino acid transporter-dependent manner. Mice with targeted Capns1 KO exhibited reduced phosphorylation of S6K and maturation of lipogenic factor sterol regulatory element-binding protein 1 in hepatocytes. Finally, we show that bone marrow transplantation negated the contribution of hematopoietic calpain systems. We conclude that overactivation of calpain systems may be responsible for the production of free amino acids in ECs, which may be sufficient to potentiate S6K/sterol regulatory element-binding protein 1-induced lipogenesis in surrounding hepatocytes."

https://openalex.org/W4224113204,"Mechanistic target of rapamycin (mTOR) and mTOR complex 1 (mTORC1), linchpins of the nutrient sensing and protein synthesis pathways, are present at relatively high levels in the ganglion cell layer (GCL) and retinal ganglion cells (RGCs) of rodent and human retinas. However, the role of mTORCs in the control of protein synthesis in RGC is unknown. Here, we applied the SUrface SEnsing of Translation (SUnSET) method of nascent protein labeling to localize and quantify protein synthesis in the retinas of adult mice. We also used intravitreal injection of an adeno-associated virus 2 vector encoding Cre recombinase in the eyes of mtor- or rptor-floxed mice to conditionally knockout either both mTORCs or only mTORC1, respectively, in cells within the GCL. A novel vector encoding an inactive Cre mutant (CreΔC) served as control. We found that retinal protein synthesis was highest in the GCL, particularly in RGC. Negation of both complexes or only mTORC1 significantly reduced protein synthesis in RGC. In addition, loss of mTORC1 function caused a significant reduction in the pan-RGC marker, RNA-binding protein with multiple splicing, with little decrease of the total number of cells in the RGC layer, even at 25 weeks after adeno-associated virus-Cre injection. These findings reveal that mTORC1 signaling is necessary for maintaining the high rate of protein synthesis in RGCs of adult rodents, but it may not be essential to maintain RGC viability. These findings may also be relevant to understanding the pathophysiology of RGC disorders, including glaucoma, diabetic retinopathy, and optic neuropathies."

Efficient utilization of blood bank facilities by frequent auditing is crucial; however, few studies have examined blood utilization in Saudi Arabia. We aimed to review the blood ordering patterns and transfusion practices, and blood bank audit effectiveness at a single center in Saudi Arabia and compare our results with those of a similar study performed in the same center 20 years ago.This study was a retrospective descriptive chart review of all healthy blood donors and recipients from January 1, 2016, to December 31, 2020. We evaluated the crossmatching-to-transfusion ratio (C/T) as an indicator of blood bank utilization and compared the findings with those of the previous study. We also evaluated changes in blood bank utilization during the coronavirus disease 2019 pandemic.Findings from 27,414 donors (men, 94.9%; mean age, 32.2 + 9.6 years) showed a 71% increase in blood donations compared to that of 2000. The donations gradually increased over the years, peaking just before COVID-19 pandemic started in March 2020. For 3,836 patients, 13,324 units of blood were crossmatched (average, 3.47 crossmatch/patient), with 23% of the crossmatch requests from surgical departments. The average C/T ratio, transfusion index, and transfusion probability (T%) were 1.37, 2.55, and 73.2%, respectively. The C/T ratio decreased by 54% between 2000 and 2020. During the pandemic, crossmatching decreased by 26% between 2019 and 2020, but with comparable C/T ratio in 2019 (1.45) and 2020 (1.39).Our hospital blood bank utilization improved over the past 20 years, showing increased donations, reduced C/T ratio, and increased T%. This improvement emphasizes the importance of blood donation campaigns, blood bank auditing, restrictive transfusion guidelines, and physician education."
https://openalex.org/W4224225511,"In this contribution, we present an innovative data-driven model to reconstruct a reliable temporal pattern for time-lagged statistical monetary figures. Our research cuts across several domains regarding the production of robust economic inferences and the bridging of top-down aggregated information from central databases with disaggregated information obtained from local sources or national statistical offices. Our test bed case study is the European Regional Development Fund (ERDF). The application we discuss deals with the reported time lag between the local expenditures of ERDF by beneficiaries in Italian regions and the corresponding payments reported in the European Commission database. Our model reconstructs the timing of these local expenditures by back-dating the observed European Commission reimbursements. The inferred estimates are then validated against the expenditures reported from the Italian National Managing Authorities (NMAs) in terms of cumulative monetary difference. The lower cumulative yearly distance of our modelled expenditures compared to the official European Commission payments confirms the robustness of our model. Using sensitivity analysis, we also analyse the relative importance of the modelling parameters on the cumulative distance between the modelled and reported expenditures. The parameters with the greatest influence on the uncertainty of this distance are the following: first, how the non-clearly regionalised expenditures are attributed to individual regions; and second, the number of backward years that the residuals of the yearly payments are spread onto. In general, the distance between the modelled and reported expenditures can be further reduced by fixing these parameters. However, the gain is only marginal for some regions. The present study paves the way for modelling exercises that are aimed at more reliable estimates of the expenditures on the ground by the ultimate beneficiaries of European funds. Additionally, the output databases can contribute to enhancing the reliability of econometric studies on the effectiveness of European Union (EU) funds."

We aimed to determine associations between systemic cytokine profiles and clinical parameters in BA patients and to identify potential BA biomarkers. Methods Systemic levels of 27 cytokines were measured in 82 BA patients and 25 healthy controls using a multiplex immunoassay. Relative mRNA expressions of candidate cytokines in 20 BA livers and 5 non-BA livers were assessed using quantitative real-time PCR. Results Higher levels of 17 cytokines including IL-1β, IL-6, IL-7, IL-8, IL-9, IL-2, IL-15, eotaxin, IP-10, MCP-1, MIP-1α, MIP-1β, G-CSF, IL-1ra, IL-4, IL-5, and IL-10 and lower levels of IFN-α and PDGF were significantly associated with BA. In BA patients, increased levels of IL-7, eotaxin, IP-10, and IL-13 were significantly associated with unfavorable outcomes including jaundice, fibrosis, and portal hypertension. Indeed, systemic levels of those cytokines were significantly correlated with clinical parameters indicating jaundice, fibrosis, and hepatic dysfunction in BA patients. Out of 27 cytokines, 4 (IL-8, IP-10, MCP-1, and PDGF) had potential as sensitive and specific biomarkers of BA. Of these, higher IL-8 levels were significantly associated with reduced survival of BA. In BA livers, relative mRNA expressions of IL-8 , IP-10 , and MCP-1 were significantly up-regulated. Conclusions Higher levels of several cytokines including inflammatory cytokines, immunomodulatory cytokines, chemokines, and anti-inflammatory cytokines and lower levels of growth factors would reflect inflammatory and immune responses related to BA development. Among 27 cytokines, plasma IL-8 might have great potential as a diagnostic and prognostic biomarker for BA."

The enzymatic reaction generates reactive hydrogen peroxide and aldehydes as by-products that can damage DNA and other biomolecules. Increased expression of SMOX is frequently found in lung, prostate, colon, stomach and liver cancer models, and the enzyme also appears to play a role in neuronal dysfunction and vascular retinopathy. Because of growing evidence that links SMOX activity with DNA damage, inflammation, and carcinogenesis, the enzyme has come into view as a potential drug target. A major challenge in cancer research is the lack of characterization of antibodies used for identification of target proteins. To overcome this limitation, we generated a panel of high-affinity rabbit monoclonal antibodies against various SMOX epitopes and selected antibodies for use in immunoblotting, SMOX quantification assays, immunofluorescence microscopy and immunohistochemistry. Immunohistochemistry analysis with the antibody SMAB10 in normal and transformed tissues confirms that SMOX is upregulated in several different cancers. Together, the panel of antibodies generated herein adds to the toolbox of high-quality reagents to study SMOX biology and to facilitate SMOX drug development."
https://openalex.org/W4224255323,"The melanocortin-1 receptor (MC1R) is one of the key proteins involved in the regulation of melanin production and several polymorphisms have been associated with different phenotypes of skin and hair color in human and nonhuman species. Most of the knowledge is centered on more homogeneous populations and studies involving an admixed group of people should be encouraged due to the great importance of understanding the human color variation. This work evaluates the MC1R diversity and the possible impacts of MC1R variants in an admixed sample population of Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, which is a product of Native American, African, and European miscegenation. Sequencing of complete coding region and part of the 3´UTR of MC1R gene identified 31 variants including one insertion and three novel synonymous substitutions in sample population grouped according to skin, hair and eye pigmentation levels. In nonmetric multidimensional scaling analysis (NMDS), three main clusters were identified, in which the Brazilian dark skin group remained in the African cluster whereas the intermediate and the light skin color phenotype in the European one. None gathered with Asians since their immigration to Brazil was a recent event. In silico analyses demonstrated that Cys35Tyr, Ile155Thr and Pro256Ser, found in our population, have a negative effect on receptor function probably due to changes on the receptor structure. Notably, Cys35Tyr mutation could potentially impair agonist binding. Altogether, this work contributes to the understanding of the genetic background of color variation on an admixed population and gives insights into the damaging effects of MC1R variants."
https://openalex.org/W4224279617,"Background Portal vein thrombosis (PVT) is a rare but severe disease that often leads to portal hypertension-related complications. It is well-known that patients with portal hypertension associated with liver cirrhosis are at increased risk for bone fractures, however data on the impact of PVT on fracture risk are lacking. Aims This study aimed to explore the impact of PVT on the incidence of bone fractures in a large German primary care cohort. Methods Patients with PVT were extensively matched to non-PVT individuals in a 1:5 ratio. The primary outcome of the study was the incidence of any bone fracture. Results This study included 596 patients with PVT and 2,980 non-PVT individuals. During five years of follow-up, the cumulative incidence of bone fractures was significantly higher in PVT patients (n = 87, 13.6%) than in those without PVT (n = 186, 6.7%) (p&lt;0.001). In Cox-regression analyses, PVT was positively associated with bone fractures (HR: 2.16; 95% CI: 1.59–2.93). This association was stronger in women (HR: 2.55; 95% CI: 1.65–3.95) than in men (HR: 1.87; 95% CI: 1.22–2.87). The strongest association was observed in the age group 51–60 years (HR: 2.50, 95% CI: 1.40–4.47). The association between PVT and bone fractures was maintained in subgroup analyses of patients with (HR: 2.03, 95% CI: 1.13–3.63) and without liver cirrhosis (HR: 1.82, 95% CI: 1.28–2.58). Conclusions PVT is independently associated with a higher incidence of bone fractures. Patients with PVT should be critically evaluated for fracture risk and preventive measures should be considered."
https://openalex.org/W4224222392,"Growth hormone (GH) deficiency (GHD) is often complicated by non-functioning pituitary tumors (NFPTs); however, its prevalence remains unclear because preoperative screening for GHD with provocative tests is not recommended. Accordingly, we attempted to clarify the characteristics of GHD in unoperated patients with NFPT.We retrospectively reviewed adult patients with non-functioning pituitary adenoma (NFPA) and Rathke's cyst who underwent preoperative GH-releasing peptide-2 (GHRP-2) tests from January 2013 to December 2016. We investigated the association between peak GH response to GHRP-2 and background characteristics.Among 104 patients (85 NFPA and 19 Rathke's cysts), 45 (43%) presented severe GHD, as diagnosed using GHRP-2 tests. Body mass index (β = -0.210, P = 0.007), free thyroxine (β = 0.440, P < 0.001), and tumor height (β = -0.254, P < 0.001) were significant variables for determining the peak GH response to GHRP-2 in multiple regression analyses. Overweight (odds ratio, 3.86; 95% confidence interval, 1.02-14.66) was significantly associated with severe GHD after adjustment for age, sex, creatinine, free thyroxine, tumor height and clinical diagnosis. The regression slopes between tumor height and peak GH response to GHRP-2 significantly differed between overweight patients and non-overweight individuals, as determined by analysis of covariance (P = 0.040). In the 48 patients who underwent postoperative GHRP-2 tests, severe postoperative GHD was significantly more common in overweight patients than non-overweight individuals (100% vs. 48%, P < 0.001).We observed a negative synergistic effect between overweight and tumor size on GH secretion in patients with NFPTs, indicating that GH provocation tests for diagnosing underestimated GHD could be considered in overweight unoperated patients with large NFPTs."
https://openalex.org/W4224230447,"Kinesin-1 is an ATP-driven, two-headed motor protein that transports intracellular cargoes (loads) along microtubules. The movement of kinesin-1 has generally been modeled according to its correlation with ATP cleavage (forward movement), synthesis (backward movement), or unproductive cleavage (futile consumption). Based on recent experimental observations, we formulate a mechanochemical model for this movement in which the forward/backward/futile cycle can be realized through multiple biochemical pathways. Our results show that the backward motion of kinesin-1 occurs mainly through backward sliding along the microtubule and is usually also coupled with ATP hydrolysis. We also found that with a low external load, about 80% of ATP is wasted (futile consumption) by kinesin-1. Furthermore, at high ATP concentrations or under high external loads, both heads of kinesin-1 are always in the ATP- or ADP ⋅ Pi-binding state and tightly bound to the microtubule, while at low ATP concentrations and low loads, kinesin-1 is mainly in the one-head-bound state. Unless the external load is near the stall force, the motion of kinesin-1 is almost deterministic."

https://openalex.org/W4224245578,"Linear replicons can be found in a minority of prokaryotic organisms, including Borrelia species and Agrobacterium tumefaciens. The problem with replicating the lagging strand end of linear DNAs is circumvented in these organisms by the presence of covalently closed DNA hairpin telomeres at the DNA termini. Telomere resolvases are enzymes responsible for generating these hairpin telomeres from a dimeric replication intermediate through a two-step DNA cleavage and rejoining reaction referred to as telomere resolution. It was previously shown that the agrobacterial telomere resolvase, TelA, possesses ssDNA annealing activity in addition to telomere resolution activity. The annealing activity derives, chiefly, from the N-terminal domain. This domain is dispensable for telomere resolution. In this study, we used activity analyses of an N-terminal domain deletion mutant, domain add back experiments, and protein-protein interaction studies and we report that the N-terminal domain of TelA is involved in inhibitory interactions with the remainder of TelA that are relieved by the binding of divalent metal ions. We also found that the regulation of telomere resolution by the N-terminal domain of TelA extends to suppression of inappropriate enzymatic activity, including hairpin telomere fusion (reaction reversal) and recombination between replicated telomeres to form a Holliday junction."
https://openalex.org/W4224268243,"Background The contribution of left atrial disease and excessive supraventricular ectopic activity (ESVEA) to the risk for incident atrial fibrillation (AF) is incompletely understood. Objective To analyse the ten-year risk to develop AF in patients with cardiovascular risk factors and to define the impact of parameters of left atrial disease and ESVEA on AF risk. Methods 148 patients from the Diast-CHF trial with at least one cardiovascular risk factor and free of AF at baseline were followed for 10 years. Left atrial disease was defined as left atrial volume index (LAVI) &gt;35 ml/m 2 , P-terminal force in lead V 1 (PTFV 1 ) &gt;4000 ms*μV or elevated N-terminal pro-B-type natriuretic peptide (NT-proBNP) &gt;250 pg/ml. We analyzed the association of these parameters and ESVEA (either &gt;720 premature atrial contractions (PAC) or one atrial run &gt;20 beats per day) on AF-free survival. Results After ten years, AF was newly detected in twelve patients (13.4%) with signs of left atrial disease and two patients (3.4%) without signs of left atrial disease (p = 0.04). LAVI (p = 0.005), ESVEA (p = 0.016) and NT-proBNP (p = 0.010) were significantly associated with AF-free survival in univariate analysis. A combined Cox model of left atrial disease parameters showed associations for NT-proBNP (HR 3.56; 95%CI 1.33–5.31; p = 0.04) and PAC (HR 2.66; 95%CI 1.25–10.15; p = 0.01) but not for LAVI or PTFV 1 with AF-free survival. Conclusion The risk for AF is higher in patients with cardiovascular risk factors and signs of left atrial disease. NT-proBNP and premature atrial contractions independently predict AF-free survival. The role of excessive supraventricular ectopic activity for the assessment of AF risk may be underestimated and requires further study."

However, the association between electrophysiological responses of the sensory system and subjective peripheral sensation (SPS) during a voluntary muscle contraction remains unclear. This study aimed to describe the changes in SPS, spinal α-motoneuron excitability (F-wave to M-wave amplitude), and somatosensory evoked potentials (SEPs) during a unilateral pinch-grip task. Outcome variables were measured on the side ipsilateral and contralateral to the muscle contraction and at rest (control). Participants were 8 healthy men aged 20.9±0.8 years. The isometric pinch-grip task was performed at 30% of the maximum voluntary isometric force measured for the right and left hands separately. The appearance rate of the F-wave during the task was significantly higher for the ipsilateral (right) hand than for the contralateral (left) hand and control condition. Although there was no difference in the F-wave latency between hands and the control condition, the amplitude of the F-wave was significantly higher for the ipsilateral (right) hand than for the contralateral (left) hand and the control condition. There was no difference in the amplitude of the SEP at N20. However, the amplitude at P25 was significantly lower for the ipsilateral (right) hand than for the contralateral (left) hand and the control condition. The accuracy rate of detecting tactile stimulation, evaluated for 20 repetitions using a Semmes-Weinstein monofilament at the sensory threshold for each participant, was significantly lower during the pinch-grip task for both the ipsilateral (right) and contralateral (left) hands than in the control condition. Overall, our findings show that SPS and neurophysiological parameters were not modulated in parallel during the task, with changes in the subjective sensation preceding changes in electrophysiological indices during the motor task. Our findings provide basic information on sensory-motor coordination."

Thus, this study sought to assess the incidence and predictors of TB among adult HIV positive patients on ART. Methods This was a hospital based retrospective study including 368 adult HIV positive patients on ART in Gondar comprehensive specialized hospital between January 1, 2016, and April 30, 2019. Data was extracted from clinical laboratory and HIV care ART follow up clinic. The bi-variable and multivariable regression models were used to ascertain predictors of incident TB. Data was analyzed using SPSS version 20 software. Results A total of 335 adult HIV positive patients were included in the analysis, of whom, 56 (16.7%) were developed incident TB. Being ambulatory and bedridden (AOR: 2.2, 95% CI: 1.1, 4.6), advanced WHO clinical HIV disease stage (III and IV) (AOR: 3.2, 95% CI: 1.6, 6.1), not taking INH (AOR: 2.8, 95% CI: 1.3, 5.9), and baseline CD4 + T cell count ≤ 200 cell/mm 3 (AOR: 3.6, 95% CI: 1.8, 7.2) were found to be the predictors of tuberculosis incidence. Conclusion The study indicated a high TB incidence among HIV positive patients in Gondar. Therefore, scaling up the isoniazid preventive therapy program and its strict compliance is necessary to avert HIV fueled tuberculosis in HIV endemic areas."

Through a cross-sectional design, this study examined performance on aspects of attention and executive control among varsity athletes playing soccer (strategic sport) or track & field (static sport) using a computerized test of attention and executive control. Ninety-seven university athletes participating in soccer (n = 50) or track and field (n = 47) were included in the study. Domains of attention and executive control were examined using the Attention Network Test-Interactions (ANT-I). Mean reaction time (RT) and intra-individual variability (IIV) were compared between groups as measures of performance speed and performance stability respectively. Soccer players demonstrated overall faster RTs (p = 0.0499; ηp2 = .04) and higher response accuracy (p = .021, d = .48) on the ANT-I compared to track and field athletes. Faster RTs were observed for soccer players when presented with an alerting tone (p = .029, d = .45), valid orienting cue (p = .019, d = .49) and incongruent flanker (p = .031, d = .45). No significant group differences were observed in IIV (p = .083, d = .36). Athletes engaging in strategic sports (i.e., soccer) demonstrated faster performance under test conditions that required higher vigilance and conflict resolution. These findings suggest that engagement in strategic sports is associated with enhanced performance on non-sport-related cognitive tasks of attention and executive control."

Unlike in Escherichia coli and Saccharomyces cerevisiae , the synthesis of cardiolipin is essential for growth of Trypanosoma brucei parasites in culture. Inhibition of cardiolipin production has been shown to result in major changes in the T . brucei proteome and energy metabolism, with CLDP43, a mitochondrial protein containing a StaR-related lipid transfer (START)-like domain, being depleted in a cardiolipin-dependent way. We now show that in T . brucei procyclic forms lacking CLDP43, cardiolipin metabolism and mitochondrial function are affected. Using quantitative and qualitative lipid analyses, we found that while steady-state levels of cardiolipin were elevated in CLDP43 knock-out parasites compared to parental cells, de novo formation of cardiolipin was down-regulated. In addition, depletion of CLDP43 resulted in partial loss of mitochondrial membrane potential and decreased ATP production via substrate level phosphorylation. Recombinant CLDP43 was found to bind cardiolipin and phosphatidic acid in lipid overlay experiments, suggesting that it may be involved in transport or synthesis of cardiolipin or its precursors in T . brucei ."

Investigation of neuromuscular control strategies in these individuals may reveal factors that contribute to these functional deficits. The purpose of this pilot study was to determine the relationship between patient function and modular control during gait before and after TKA. Methods Electromyography data from 36 participants (38 knees) were collected from 8 lower extremity muscles on the TKA-involved limb during ≥5 over-ground walking trials before (n = 30), 6-months after (n = 26), and 24-months after (n = 13) surgery. Muscle modules were estimated using non-negative matrix factorization. The number of modules was determined from 500 resampled trials. Results A higher number of modules was related to better performance-based and patient-reported function before and 6-months after surgery. Participants with organization similar to healthy, age-matched controls trended toward better function 24-months after surgery, though these results were not statistically significant. We also observed plasticity in the participants’ modular control strategies, with 100% of participants who were present before and 24-months after surgery (10/10) demonstrating changes in the number of modules and/or organization of at least 1 module. Conclusions This pilot work suggests that functional improvements following TKA may initially present as increases in the number of modules recruited during gait. Subsequent improvements in function may present as improved module organization. Noteworthy This work is the first to characterize motor modules in TKA both before and after surgery and to demonstrate changes in the number and organization of modules over the time course of recovery, which may be related to changes in patient function. The plasticity of modular control following TKA is a key finding which has not been previously documented and may be useful in predicting or improving surgical outcomes through novel rehabilitation protocols."
