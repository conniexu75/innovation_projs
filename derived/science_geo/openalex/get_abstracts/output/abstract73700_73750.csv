https://openalex.org/W114418772,"This article describes research into the conformational stability of globular proteins -- specifically the effects of various electrolytes and nonelectrolytes on the thermally induced structural transition in ribonuclease. Optical rotatory methods were used to measure transition parameters including: melting temperature (T m ), the size of the transition (DELTA(alpha)), its breadth, and the specific optical rotation and optical rotary dispersion of the pre- and post-transition compounds. Structural perturbants investigated were neutral salts (with and without ethylene glycol), urea and the guanidinium salts, the tetraalkylammonium ions and the alcohols. Physicochemical instrumental analysis methods used in the study include polarimetry, viscometry, ultraviolet (UV) spectroscopy, short column sedimentation (weight average molecular weights); spectrophotometry and interferometry were used to characterize the bovine pancreatic ribonuclease used for most of the experiments."

https://openalex.org/W115436759,"SUMMARY The finding reported here, that isolated mitochondria can synthesize malate in good yield from pyruvate and COz, offers an alternative to the transmembrane movement of oxaloacetate. Thus, malate could be formed within the mitochondria by the action of malic dehydrogenase and NADH on oxaloacetate. The malate could pass through the mitochondrial membrane and then be re-oxidized to oxaloacetate by the malic dehydrogen- ase of the cell sap with subsequent conversion of this extramito- chondrial oxaloacetate to P-enolpyruvate. 2. A net synthesis of malate and citrate was demonstrated in mitochondria incubated under these conditions. 3. Essentially all of the radioactive compounds formed were released from the mitochondria during the incubation. 4. It is proposed that in rat liver the initial stages of gluco- neogenesis from pyruvate proceed as follows. In the mito- chondria, pyruvate is carboxylated to oxaloacetate. The oxalo- acetate, which does not react with acetyl coenzyme A to form citrate, is reduced to malate. Malate or fumarate or both cross the mitochondrial membrane into the cytoplasm of the cell. There malate is oxidized to oxaloacetate which is in turn con- verted to phosphoenolpyruvate. Fumarate could function in a similar manner, and it does not appear feasible at the present time to devise experiments to choose between malate and fumarate as the compound which moves across the membrane. Thus, in the experiments reported here, the mitochondria were twice washed, but there might well have been fumarase present outside the mitochondria which would have regenerated malate from fumarate, had only fuma- rate crossed the mitochondrial membrane. AcknowledgmentsWe are indebted to Miss Rosalind Levene of Dr. Cecil Cooper’s laboratory for assessing the respiratory con- trol of our mitochondrial preparation. The helpful criticism of Dr. M. F. Utter during the preparation of this manuscript is greatly appreciated. The technical assistance of Mr. Glenn DeBoer and Mr. Endre Solti is gratefully acknowledged."

https://openalex.org/W2052002324,Both processes involve extremely large amplification between the stimulus and the response. In vision it had been suggested that thismight be achieved by a chain of successive proenzyme-enzyme activations. Such a chain has now been found to underlie the mechanism of blood clotting. Methods are suggested for pursuing this comparison further.

Recently the important role of this enzyme in the degradation of sucrose in plant storage tissues was pointed out2. Other nucleotides, notably ADP, can also serve as glucosyl acceptors in this system3,4. Furthermore, tracer experiments with carbon-14 have shown that ADP-glucose formation from sucrose and ADP is a channel for the transfer of glucose from sucrose to starch4,5, and that TDP-glucose is a substrate for sucrose synthesis in a crude enzyme preparation obtained from wheat endosperm3."

https://openalex.org/W2044184874,"RECENT reports have suggested the occurrence of DNA in mitochondria of yeast1 and chick embryo2. These studies have added interest in view of the presence of DNA in the chloroplast fractions of algae and higher plants3, and its obvious implications for non-chromosomal inheritance4. The respiratory-deficient petite mutants of yeast possess altered mitochondria5, and they are easily induced by a variety of agents6. It is important to establish the chemical nature of the non-chromosomal determinants of this inheritance pattern, with DNA and RNA most probably involved, since they are the principal genetic materials. To approach the question of which nucleic acid might be the determinant for the respiratory characteristic, Moustacchi and Marcovich7 added uridine and thymidine along with the mutagenic base analogue 5-fluorouracil (5-FU). Their data showed that added thymidine was ineffective at all mutagen concentrations used, but that uridine significantly reduced the frequency of mutants induced at 5-FU concentrations of 0.1 and 0.2 µg/ml. There was no appreciable effect when uridine was added at 5-FU concentrations lower than 0.1 or higher than 0.2 µg/ml. When both nucleosides were added, the results paralleled those obtained with only thymidine added or with neither nucleoside present. They concluded that RNA was more likely than DNA to be the determinant involved, even though the uridine effect occurred only in a narrow portion of the concentration range of the mutagen. We have reinvestigated the problem, using the same experimental design, with the more commonly applied mutagen for petite induction, the acridine dye acriflavin. Unlike Moustacchi and Marcovich7, we found that both uridine and thymidine reduced the frequency of petite mutations induced by acriflavin. Our results, like theirs, also showed the nucleoside effect to be restricted to a narrow segment of the range of mutagen concentrations tested."
