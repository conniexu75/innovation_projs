These metabolic abnormalities are secondary to the deficit in NaCl reabsorption, but the underlying mechanisms are unclear. To gain a better understanding of the role of NCC in sodium and fluid volume homeostasis and in the pathogenesis of Gitelman's syndrome, we used gene targeting to prepare an NCC-deficient mouse. Null mutant (Ncc −/−) mice appear healthy and are normal with respect to acid-base balance, plasma electrolyte concentrations, serum aldosterone levels, and blood pressure.Ncc −/− mice retain Na+ as well as wild-type mice when fed a Na+-depleted diet; however, after 2 weeks of Na+ depletion the mean arterial blood pressure of Ncc −/− mice was significantly lower than that of wild-type mice. In addition, Ncc −/−mice exhibited increased renin mRNA levels in kidney, hypomagnesemia and hypocalciuria, and morphological changes in the distal convoluted tubule. These data indicate that the loss of NCC activity in the mouse causes only subtle perturbations of sodium and fluid volume homeostasis, but renal handling of Mg2+ and Ca2+ are altered, as observed in Gitelman's syndrome.

The thiazide-sensitive Na+-Cl−cotransporter (NCC)1 is expressed on the apical membranes of distal convoluted tubule epithelial cells (1Ellison D.H. Biemesderfer D. Morrisey J. Lauring J. Desir G.V.

In humans, mutations in the genes encoding NCC and the apical Na+-K+-2Cl− cotransporter have been shown to cause Gitelman's (6Simon D.B. Nelson-Williams C. Bia M.J. Ellison D. Karet F.E. Molina A.M.

Hypokalemic alkalosis is a common feature of both diseases but there are a number of significant differences. Patients with Bartter's syndrome present clinically at an early age, have severe salt wasting and volume depletion (9Bettinelli A. Bianchetti M.G. Girardin E. Caringella A. Cecconi M. Appiani A.C. Pavanello L. Gastaldi R. Isimbaldi C. Lama G. Marchesoni C. Matteucci C. Patriarca P. Di Natale B. Setzu C. Vitucci P. J.

In contrast, patients with Gitelman's syndrome are frequently asymptomatic at younger ages, display only limited evidence of salt wasting or hypovolemia, and exhibit hypocalciuria and hypomagnesemia (9Bettinelli A. Bianchetti M.G. Girardin E. Caringella A. Cecconi M. Appiani A.C. Pavanello L. Gastaldi R. Isimbaldi C. Lama G. Marchesoni C. Matteucci C. Patriarca P. Di Natale B. Setzu C. Vitucci P. J.

Identification of mutations in NCC as the molecular basis of Gitelman's syndrome was a major breakthrough in the elucidation of the mechanisms underlying the metabolic abnormalities seen in affected patients (6Simon D.B. Nelson-Williams C. Bia M.J. Ellison D. Karet F.E. Molina A.M. Vaara I. Iwata F. Cushner H.M. Koolen M. Gainza F.J. Gitelman H.J. Lifton R.P. Nat.

Genet. 1996; 59: 1019-1026PubMed Google Scholar). Given the established biochemical function of NCC, it was apparent that the loss of NCC or a reduction in its activity would impair NaCl reabsorption in the DCT, and that the metabolic disturbances must be secondary to this defect. Despite this advance in our understanding of Gitelman's syndrome, the role of NCC in the maintenance of sodium and fluid volume homeostasis is unclear, and the mechanisms by which NCC deficiency causes perturbations of acid-base homeostasis and renal handling of K+, Na+, Ca2+, and Mg2+ have not been determined. To begin addressing these issues we have prepared and analyzed a mouse model with a null mutation in the Ncc gene (locusSlc12a3). The strain 129/SvJ phage library from which Ncc genomic clones were isolated and the targeting vector, MJK+KO, were described previously (11Schultheis P.J. Clarke L.L. Meneton P. Harline M. Boivin G.P. Stemmermann G. Duffy J.J. Doetschman T. Miller M.L. Shull G.E. J. Clin. Invest. 1998; 101: 1243-1253Crossref PubMed Scopus (222) Google Scholar). A 2.5-kb PvuII genomic fragment, ending with codon 485 in exon 12, was subcloned into a cloning site 5′ of the neo gene in the vector and served as the 5′ homologous arm. The 3′ arm (1.8 kb) was PCR amplified from a genomic clone using primers corresponding to codons 494–506 in exon 12 and codons 528–539 in exon 13. XhoI sites were included in the primers to facilitate subcloning into the vector. The 3′ outside probe used for Southern blot analysis began at codon 546 in exon 13 and included 3.7 kb of genomic sequence. Electroporation of embryonic stem cells, selection of cells in the presence of G418 and gancyclovir, Southern blot analysis of DNA samples from cells and mice, and blastocyst-mediated transgenesis were carried out as described previously (11Schultheis P.J. Clarke L.L. Meneton P. Harline M. Boivin G.P. Stemmermann G. Duffy J.J. Doetschman T. Miller M.L. Shull G.E. J. Clin. Invest. 1998; 101: 1243-1253Crossref PubMed Scopus (222) Google Scholar). DNA from tail biopsies was analyzed by PCR. Forward (5′-AGGGTCAAGGGCACGGTTGGC-3′) and reverse (5′-GGTAAAGGGAGCGGGTCCGAGG-3′) primers corresponding to intron sequences flanking the disrupted exon amplified a 265-base pair product from the wild-type gene. A reverse primer (5′-GCATGCTCCAGACTGCCTTG-3′) complementary to sequences in the phosphoglycerate kinase promoter, which drives the neo gene, and the forward primer described above amplified a 188-base pair product from the targeted allele. Total RNA was isolated from the kidneys of adult mice using Tri-Reagent (Molecular Research Center, Inc., Cincinnati, OH) according to the supplier's protocol. Blots were prepared and hybridized with GAPDH, rat renin, and rat NCC cDNA probes as described previosly (11Schultheis P.J. Clarke L.L. Meneton P. Harline M. Boivin G.P. Stemmermann G. Duffy J.J. Doetschman T. Miller M.L. Shull G.E. J. Clin. Invest. 1998; 101: 1243-1253Crossref PubMed Scopus (222) Google Scholar). mRNA expression was quantified by PhosphorImager analysis. Blood (∼50 μl) was collected into heparin-treated capillary tubes from the femoral artery of anesthetized mice or from the tail vein of awake mice and immediately analyzed for gases, electrolytes, and pH using a Chiron diagnostics model 348 pH/blood gas analyzer (Chiron, Norwood, MA). Serum Mg2+ and Ca2+ concentrations were determined colorimetrically (calmagite and arsenazo III assays, Sigma). An 125I radioimmunoassay kit (Diagnostic Products Corp., Los Angeles, CA) was used to measure serum aldosterone concentrations. Custom research diets were purchased from Harlan-Teklad (Madison, WI). Adult Ncc +/+ and Ncc −/− mice were housed in metabolic cages as described previously (12Meneton P. Schultheis P.J. Greeb J. Nieman M.L. Liu L.H. Clarke L.L. Duffy J.J. Doetschman T. Lorenz J.N. Shull G.E. J. Clin. Invest. 1998; 101: 536-542Crossref PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar). The mice were given deionized water ad libitum and fed either Na+-replete (TD 90229, 1% NaCl) or Na+-depleted diets (TD 94268, 0.1% NaCl; TD 90228, 0.01% NaCl). The volume of urine collected during each 24-h period was measured and Na+ and K+ content was assayed by flame photometry (Corning model 480). Urinary Ca2+ concentrations were determined colorimetrically (arsenazo III assay, Sigma). Mean arterial blood pressure of mice that were maintained on a 1% NaCl diet or fed a 0.01% NaCl diet for 2 weeks was measured using a femoral artery catheter (13Lorenz J.N. Robbins J. Am. J. Physiol. 1997; 272: H1137-H1146PubMed Google Scholar). The mice were anesthetized with intraperitoneal injections of inactin (100 μg/g body weight) and ketamine (50 μg/g body weight). Kidney sections from 10–15-week-old Ncc +/+ and Ncc −/− mice (n = 5 for each genotype) were prepared for light and transmission electron microscopy as described previously (11Schultheis P.J. Clarke L.L. Meneton P. Harline M. Boivin G.P. Stemmermann G. Duffy J.J. Doetschman T. Miller M.L. Shull G.E. J. Clin. Invest. 1998; 101: 1243-1253Crossref PubMed Scopus (222) Google Scholar). Both objective and subjective criteria were used in the analysis of DCT and other distal tubule cells, and morphometric analyses were performed without prior knowledge of the genotype. Features used to distinguish DCT cells from other cortical cell types (14Dorup J. J. Ultrastruct. Res. 1985; 92: 101-118Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar, 15Madsen K.M. Tisher C.C. Am J. Physiol. 1986; 250: F1-F15Crossref Google Scholar) included the absence of a brush border, apically placed nuclei, epithelial thickness, and the shape and placement of mitochondria relative to invaginations of the basolateral membrane. The transition point between DCT and connecting tubule cannot be clearly delineated in some species (15Madsen K.M. Tisher C.C. Am J. Physiol. 1986; 250: F1-F15Crossref Google Scholar), and there is evidence that the morphology of DCT cells is dependent on the transport activity of the cell (16Kaissling B. Bachmann S. Kriz W. Am. J. Physiol. 1985; 248: F374-F381PubMed Google Scholar, 17Kaissling B. Stanton B.A. Am. J. Physiol. 1988; 255: F1256-F1268PubMed Google Scholar, 18Ellison D.H. Velazquez H. Wright F.S. J. Clin. Invest. 1989; 83: 113-126Crossref PubMed Scopus (236) Google Scholar). Therefore, objective measurements were used to distinguish DCT and connecting tubule cells, and to identify alterations in the DCT. Measurements were made onNcc +/+ and Ncc −/− DCT cells which had been classified based on both appearance and, as an objective criterion, the position of their nuclei. At × 1250 magnification, the distances from the basement membrane to the inferior pole of the nucleus and the apical membrane were measured. Distal tubule cells containing apically (within the upper two-thirds of the cell) and basally (within or penetrating into the lower one-third of the cell) positioned nuclei were classified as DCT and “other” distal tubule cells, respectively. While this method cannot be used to show definitively that DCT cells are altered in number, rather than having an altered morphology that more closely resembles connecting tubule cells, it does indicate that the features used to classify them as DCT have changed. To determine the volume density of the DCT a 32-point grid was projected onto sequentially encountered fields of kidney cortex at × 1250 magnification, with 25 fields surveyed for kidneys of each mouse. The height of DCT and other distal tubule cells was obtained by digitizing a line that extended from the basement membrane to the tubule lumen. Values represent the mean ± S.E. A mixed factorial analysis of variance with repeated measures was used to assess statistical significance, and post hoc analysis of individual means was accomplished by contrast analysis. Embryonic stem cells carrying an Ncc null allele were generated by inserting the neo gene into exon 12 (Fig. 1,A and B) and used to establish a null mutant mouse line. PCR analysis of tail DNAs from offspring of heterozygous mating pairs (Fig. 1 C) showed that mice of all three genotypes were born at the expected Mendelian ratios (37 +/+, 83 +/−, and 48 −/−). Northern blot analysis of kidney RNA (Fig. 1 D) showed that Ncc mRNA expression was reduced in Ncc +/− mice and absent in Ncc −/− mice, demonstrating that theNcc gene was inactivated. Ncc −/−mice grew normally, were indistinguishable fromNcc +/+ littermates in appearance and behavior, and were fertile. Blood gases, blood pH, and plasma electrolytes were measured in both awake and anesthetized mice that were maintained on either a normal diet or on a Na+-depleted diet for 14 or 20 days. As shown in Table I, there were no significant differences in blood gases, blood pH, or HCO3−concentrations between Ncc +/+ and Ncc −/− mice when maintained on either diet, nor were there significant differences between the two genotypes in plasma Na+, Cl−, K+, or Ca2+ concentrations. Interestingly, serum Ca2+concentrations of both Ncc +/+ and Ncc −/− mice maintained on the Na+-depleted diet were significantly reduced when compared with the levels observed under Na+-replete conditions.Table IBlood gases, acid-base status, and plasma electrolytesParameterNa+-replete dietNa+-depleted dietAnesthetized1-an = 4 Ncc +/+ and 4Ncc −/− samples.Awake1-bn = 8 Ncc −/− and 9Ncc −/− samples except for Ca2+(Ncc +/+, n = 5;Ncc −/−, n = 6).Anesthetized1-cn = 8 Ncc −/+ and 9Ncc −/− samples.Awake1-dn = 5 Ncc +/+ and 5Ncc −/− samples.+/+−/−+/+−/−+/+−/−+/+−/−pCO244.7 ± 2.445.9 ± 2.938.6 ± 1.239.9 ± 1.752.8 ± 3.051.2 ± 1.836.5 ± 1.537.3 ± 0.6pO269.2 ± 2.468.8 ± 4.475.3 ± 2.373.3 ± 3.372.0 ± 3.271.8 ± 2.170.3 ± 1.469.2 ± 1.7pH7.36 ± 0.017.39 ± 0.017.41 ± 0.027.43 ± 0.017.31 ± 0.027.29 ± 0.057.45 ± 0.017.46 ± 0.01HCO3−24.6 ± 1.127.6 ± 2.024.0 ± 0.625.6 ± 0.925.6 ± 0.824.8 ± 2.124.8 ± 1.025.8 ± 0.6Na+150.5 ± 1.9159.2 ± 6.6147.0 ± 1.4150.0 ± 1.7151.3 ± 0.7151.4 ± 0.9152.6 ± 1.3152.8 ± 0.8K+4.4 ± 0.354.3 ± 0.296.1 ± 0.185.7 ± 0.294.5 ± 0.084.4 ± 0.246.9 ± 0.246.3 ± 0.39Cl−ND1-eND, not determined.ND116.9 ± 0.9114.6 ± 0.6117.1 ± 1.3115.2 ± 1.1111.6 ± 1.0109.4 ± 0.6Ca2+NDND3.2 ± 0.13.1 ± 0.1NDND2.2 ± 0.11-fSignificantly different from mice of the same genotype fed a Na+ replete diet (p < 0.0001).2.0 ± 0.21-fSignificantly different from mice of the same genotype fed a Na+ replete diet (p < 0.0001).All values (mm Hg for gases and mm for ions) are means ± S.E.1-a n = 4 Ncc +/+ and 4Ncc −/− samples.1-b n = 8 Ncc −/− and 9Ncc −/− samples except for Ca2+(Ncc +/+, n = 5;Ncc −/−, n = 6).1-c n = 8 Ncc −/+ and 9Ncc −/− samples.1-d n = 5 Ncc +/+ and 5Ncc −/− samples.1-e ND, not determined.1-f Significantly different from mice of the same genotype fed a Na+ replete diet (p < 0.0001).

Ncc +/+ and Ncc −/− mice were fed a Na+-replete diet (1% NaCl) for 9 days followed by a Na+-depleted diet (0.01% NaCl) for 3 weeks, and the amounts of Na+ and K+ excreted in the urine were measured (Fig. 2, A and B). Urinary Na+ excretion was similar in Ncc +/+ (0.50 ± 0.02 mmol/day) and Ncc −/− (0.46 ± 0.03 mmol/day) mice during the Na+-replete period, and after only 2 days of Na+ restriction (Fig. 2 A) was reduced to very low levels (∼0.5% of the excretion rate during the Na+-replete period) in mice of both genotypes. During the Na+ depletion period, Na+ excretion averaged 2.6 ± 0.45 and 1.9 ± 0.39 μmol/day in Ncc +/+ and Ncc −/− mice, respectively; the differences were not statistically significant. No significant difference in daily urinary K+ excretion was observed between Ncc +/+ and Ncc −/− mice during the Na+-replete (0.63 ± 0.03 mmol/day in Ncc +/+ mice; 0.57 ± 0.03 mmol/day in Ncc −/− mice) or Na+ depletion (0.50 ± 0.02 mmol/day in Ncc +/+, 0.51 ± 0.02 mmol/day in Ncc −/−) periods (Fig. 2 B). When the mice were fed a normal diet, mean arterial pressures, measured using a femoral artery catheter, were slightly lower in Ncc −/−(84.7 ± 5.6 mm Hg) than in Ncc +/+(87.4 ± 6.6 mm Hg) mice (Fig. 3), but the difference was not statistically significant. However, after both groups of mice were fed a Na+-depleted diet for 2 weeks (Fig. 3), the mean arterial pressure of Ncc −/− mice (72.3 ± 5.0 mm Hg) was significantly lower than that of wild-type mice (86.1 ± 3.9 mm Hg). To assess whether the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone axis was activated in Ncc −/− mice, renin mRNA in kidney and serum aldosterone levels were measured in mice that were fed a Na+-replete diet. In an initial experiment we analyzed renin mRNA in pooled kidney samples (two mice of each genotype) and found that renin mRNA, when normalized against GAPDH mRNA, was 1.9-fold higher in kidneys of Ncc −/− mice (data not shown). An additional experiment was performed in which kidney RNA from three mice of each genotype was analyzed. As shown in Fig. 4 A, renin mRNA levels were higher in Ncc −/− kidneys than in Ncc +/+ kidneys (averaging 1.7-fold when normalized against GAPDH mRNA). Serum aldosterone levels (Fig. 4 B) were similar in Ncc +/+ (0.67 ± 0.16 ng/ml) and Ncc −/− (0.65 ± 0.13 ng/ml) mice that were fed a normal diet (1% NaCl). After 2 weeks of Na+ restriction, aldosterone levels were higher in Ncc −/− mice (2.73 ± 0.32 ng/ml) than in Ncc +/+ mice (2.18 ± 0.27 ng/ml), but the difference was not statistically significant. Because hypocalciuria and hypomagnesemia are commonly observed in Gitelman's syndrome, we analyzed urinary Ca2+and serum Mg2+ concentrations in theNcc −/− and Ncc +/+ mice that were used in the Na+ depletion study. Urinary Ca2+ excretion was significantly lower in Ncc −/− (0.045 ± 0.004 mg/day) than in Ncc +/+ (0.208 ± 0.014 mg/day) mice when they were fed a Na+-replete diet (Fig. 5 A). However, urinary Ca2+ excretion in Ncc +/+ mice dropped by ∼60% after 24 h of Na+ depletion and remained at this level (0.084 ± 0.008 mg/day) throughout the 3-week Na+ depletion period. In contrast, there was no significant change in urinary Ca2+ excretion in Ncc −/− mice when they were fed the Na+-depleted diet. Serum Mg2+ was significantly lower in Ncc −/− than in Ncc +/+ mice when the animals were fed either normal (0.51 ± 0.03 and 0.87 ± 0.03 mm, respectively) or Na+-depleted (0.76 ± 0.02 and 1.17 ± 0.07 mm, respectively) diets (Fig. 5 B). For both Ncc −/− and Ncc +/+ mice, serum Mg2+ was significantly higher (p < 0.002) after being fed the Na+-depleted diet for 3 weeks. In response to treatment with diuretics or altered dietary Na+, DCT cells undergo ultrastructural changes (16Kaissling B. Bachmann S. Kriz W. Am. J. Physiol. 1985; 248: F374-F381PubMed Google Scholar, 17Kaissling B. Stanton B.A. Am. J. Physiol. 1988; 255: F1256-F1268PubMed Google Scholar, 18Ellison D.H. Velazquez H. Wright F.S. J. Clin.

Physiol. 1988; 255: F1269-F1275PubMed Google Scholar), which are thought to be due to alterations in Na+transport activity. Because Na+ transport is likely to be severely reduced in NCC-deficient DCT cells, we examined kidneys of Ncc −/− and Ncc +/+ mice by light and electron microscopy to determine whether there were morphological correlates of the Na+ transport defect. Readily identifiable DCT cells were 6.1 ± 1.2% of cortical epithelial cells in Ncc +/+ kidneys and only 1.9 ± 0.7% in Ncc −/− kidneys (p = 0.012). In contrast, there was no significant difference in the number of other distal tubule cell types (9.1 ± 1.4% and 10.5 ± 2.2% for Ncc +/+ and Ncc −/− kidneys, respectively). Cell height was significantly decreased in Ncc −/− DCT cells (14.4 ± 0.5 μm in Ncc +/+, 12.7 ± 0.1 μm in Ncc −/−, p = 0.009) but not in other distal tubule cells (11.9 ± 0.7 μm in Ncc +/+, 11.6 ± 0.2 μm in Ncc −/−). As evident in the representative electron micrographs of mutant and wild-type cells shown in Fig. 6, mitochondria of Ncc −/− DCT cells were less elongated in shape and the association of basolateral membrane folds with the mitochondria was developed less well than in Ncc +/+cells. In order to examine the role of NCC in sodium and fluid volume homeostasis and in the pathogenesis of Gitelman's syndrome we generated an NCC-deficient mouse line. Insertion of the neo gene into exon 12 of the Ncc gene clearly produced a null mutation, asNcc mRNA could not be detected in the kidneys of homozygous mutant mice. Ncc −/− mice were born at the expected Mendelian ratios, exhibited no overt disease phenotype, and were fertile. Subsequent analyses provided evidence for a mild but largely compensated perturbation of sodium and fluid volume homeostasis, revealed morphological changes in the DCT, and demonstrated that Ncc −/− mice have hypocalciuria and hypomagnesemia, which are characteristic of Gitelman's syndrome. Although hypokalemic alkalosis is recognized as a major feature of Gitelman's syndrome in humans, analysis of blood samples fromNcc −/− mice revealed no apparent disturbances of potassium or acid-base homeostasis. The absence of hypokalemic alkalosis in Ncc −/− mice may indicate a major species difference in the effects of NCC dysfunction; however, Gitelman's syndrome is often quite mild and many patients are not identified until adulthood. In many of the case histories that have been reported, as well as in the studies demonstrating that mutations in the NCC gene cause Gitelman's syndrome (6Simon D.B. Nelson-Williams C. Bia M.J. Ellison D. Karet F.E. Molina A.M. Vaara I. Iwata F. Cushner H.M. Koolen M. Gainza F.J. Gitelman H.J. Lifton R.P. Nat.

Thus, it is possible that the patients that have been reported in the literature represent a more strongly affected subset of individuals with mutations in the NCC gene, and that the physiological consequences of such mutations differ depending on genetic background and environmental factors. Serious impairments of sodium and fluid volume homeostasis are observed in humans and/or mice with null mutations in the epithelial sodium channel of the collecting duct (21Chang S.S. Grunder S.

Given the role of NCC in NaCl reabsorption in the distal tubule, one might anticipate that NCC null mutations would also perturb sodium and fluid volume homeostasis. However, when cases of Gitelman's syndrome were distinguished from Bartter's syndrome by relatively rigorous diagnostic criteria, Gitelman's syndrome patients were typically normotensive and exhibited little direct evidence of hypovolemia (9Bettinelli A. Bianchetti M.G. Girardin E. Caringella A. Cecconi M. Appiani A.C. Pavanello L. Gastaldi R. Isimbaldi C. Lama G. Marchesoni C. Matteucci C. Patriarca P. Di Natale B. Setzu C. Vitucci P. J. Pediatr. 1992; 120: 38-43Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (326) Google Scholar). Nevertheless, elevated serum aldosterone levels (9Bettinelli A. Bianchetti M.G. Girardin E. Caringella A. Cecconi M. Appiani A.C. Pavanello L. Gastaldi R. Isimbaldi C. Lama G. Marchesoni C. Matteucci C. Patriarca P. Di Natale B. Setzu C. Vitucci P. J. Pediatr. 1992; 120: 38-43Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (326) Google Scholar) indicated that some of the mechanisms that compensate for a perturbation of sodium and fluid volume homeostasis were activated in these patients. The results of the current study suggest that NCC-deficient mice also have a mild, compensated perturbation of sodium and fluid volume homeostasis. Serum aldosterone was not elevated in Ncc −/− mice, indicating that the systemic renin-angiotensin-aldosterone axis was not activated. However, the increased renin mRNA levels in Ncc −/− kidneys is consistent with the possibility that compensation might be mediated by the intra-renal renin-angiotensin system (24Yanagawa N. Kidney Int. 1991; 39: S33-S36Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar, 25Navar L.G. Imig J.D. Zou L. Wang C.T. Semin. Nephrol. 1997; 17: 412-422PubMed Google Scholar, 26Quan A. Baum M. Semin. Nephrol. 1997; 17: 423-430PubMed Google Scholar). There was no significant difference in mean arterial blood pressure between Ncc −/−and Ncc +/+ mice when maintained on a Na+-replete diet, but anesthetizedNcc −/− mice exhibited a lower blood pressure than wild-type mice when fed a Na+-depleted diet for 2 weeks. This was surprising because Ncc −/− mice were able to retain Na+ as well as wild-type mice during the Na+-depletion period. A possible explanation for this result is that Ncc −/− mice are mildly hypovolemic, and that gradual Na+ loss during Na+ restriction reduces intravascular volume to a point where the mechanisms that regulate blood pressure can no longer fully compensate. If this interpretation is correct, it implies thatNcc −/− mice have an altered set point for Na+-fluid volume balance in which the reduction in intravascular volume due to the loss of Na+ reabsorption via NCC is largely, but not completely, corrected by compensatory mechanisms. Like patients with Gitelman's syndrome, NCC-deficient mice had low levels of both urinary Ca2+ and serum Mg2+, which are thought to be due to increased Ca2+ and decreased Mg2+ reabsorption in the DCT (27Costanzo L.S. Windhager E.E. Seldin D.W. Giebisch G. The Kidney: Physiology. Raven Press, New York1992: 2375-2393Google Scholar, 28Quamme G.A. Kidney Int. 1997; 52: 1180-1195Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (287) Google Scholar). The mechanisms by which NCC dysfunction perturbs renal Ca2+ and Mg2+ handling in Gitelman's patients are not well understood. It has been suggested that a reduction in intracellular Na+ levels as a result of the loss of NCC activity could increase the rate of Ca2+ efflux via basolateral Na+/Ca2+ exchange (27Costanzo L.S. Windhager E.E. Seldin D.W. Giebisch G. The Kidney: Physiology. Raven Press, New York1992: 2375-2393Google Scholar). Also, inhibition of NaCl uptake by chlorothiazide has been shown to decrease intracellular Cl− activity, causing hyperpolarization that in turn causes increased Ca2+ uptake via apical Ca2+channels (29Gesek F.A. Friedman P.A. J. Clin. Invest. 1992; 90: 429-438Crossref PubMed Scopus (176) Google Scholar). With regard to Mg2+ handling, there are data indicating that the hypomagnesemia might be secondary to hypokalemia (30Dai L.-J. Friedman P.A. Quamme G.A. Kidney. Int. 1997; 51: 1008-1017Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). Our results tend to negate this hypothesis asNcc −/− mice develop hypomagnesemia in the absence of hypokalemia. Also, clinical studies of patients with hypomagnesemia and hypokalemia show that correction of hypomagnesemia by dietary Mg2+ supplements often leads to correction of the hypokalemia (31Whang R.

Kidney Dis. 1990; 16: 495-500Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar), thereby suggesting that the hypokalemia is secondary to hypomagnesemia. We observed significant histological changes in the distal tubule of NCC-deficient mice, but saw no evidence of apoptosis in this segment, as observed following acute treatment with high doses of thiazides (19Loffing J. Loffing-Cueni D. Hegyi I. Kaplan M.R. Hebert S.C. Le Hir M. Kaissling B. Kidney Int. 1996; 50: 1180-1190Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar). In Ncc −/− mice, there was a sharp reduction in the number of readily identifiable DCT cells, the height of DCT cells was decreased, their mitochondria were less elongated, and their basolateral membrane folds were not as closely associated with the mitochondria. These changes are the opposite of those observed in rats treated with furosemide (16Kaissling B. Bachmann S. Kriz W. Am. J. Physiol. 1985; 248: F374-F381PubMed Google Scholar) or maintained on a high salt diet (17Kaissling B. Stanton B.A. Am. J. Physiol. 1988; 255: F1256-F1268PubMed Google Scholar), in which Na+ reabsorption in the DCT is increased. Thus, it seems likely that the alterations in the DCT of Ncc −/− mice are due to the reduced transcellular Na+ transport capacity. These data support the view (16Kaissling B. Bachmann S. Kriz W. Am. J. Physiol. 1985; 248: F374-F381PubMed Google Scholar, 17Kaissling B. Stanton B.A. Am. J. Physiol. 1988; 255: F1256-F1268PubMed Google Scholar, 18Ellison D.H. Velazquez H. Wright F.S. J. Clin.

Physiol. 1988; 255: F1269-F1275PubMed Google Scholar) that the structure of DCT cells is regulated by the level of Na+ reabsorption, and suggest that the alterations in renal Ca2+ and Mg2+ handling could be due, at least in part, to the altered structure of the DCT. In summary, our studies show that Ncc −/− mice have hypocalciuria and hypomagnesemia, but not hypokalemic alkalosis. This suggests that the renal defects in Ca2+ and Mg2+ reabsorption are a consequence of functional and/or structural alterations in the DCT caused by the loss of NCC activity rather than being secondary to systemic metabolic disturbances such as hypokalemia or alkalosis. Our results also indicate that NCC plays a relatively subtle role in the maintenance of sodium and fluid volume homeostasis, compared with that of the NHE3 Na+/H+ exchanger (23Schultheis, P. J., Clarke, L. L., Meneton, P., Miller, M. L., Soleimani, M., Gawenis, L. R., Riddle, T. M., Duffy, J. J., Doetschman, T., Wang, T., Giebisch, G., Aronson, P. S., Lorenz, J. N., and Shull, G. E. Nat.

In future studies the NCC-deficient mouse should serve as a valuable model for deciphering the mechanisms by which NCC deficiency alters renal Ca2+and Mg2+ handling and for further investigations of the role of NCC in electrolyte, fluid volume, and acid-base homeostasis."

The amount of p65 staining is measured in both the nuclei defined by Hoechst 33342 labeling and in the surrounding cytoplasmic area within a preselected number of cells/well in 96-well plates. Using this technique in synchronously activated human chondrocytes or HeLa cells, NF-κB was found to move to the nucleus with a half-time of 7–8 min for HeLa and 12–13 min for chondrocytes, a rate in each case about 4–5 min slower than that of IκBα degradation. IL-1 receptor antagonist and anti-TypeI IL-1 receptor antiserum on the one hand and anti-TNFα and monoclonal anti-TNF receptor 1 antibodies on the other hand could be shown to respectively inhibit IL-1 and TNFα stimulation in both cell types. In contrast, a polyclonal anti-TNF receptor 1 antiserum exhibited both a 50% agonism and a 50% antagonism to a TNFα stimulation in a dose-dependent fashion, indicating that subtle functional responses to complex agonist and antagonist stimuli could be measured. The effects of different proteasome inhibitors to prevent IκBα degradation and subsequent NF-κB translocation could also be discriminated; Leu-Leu-Leu aldehyde was only a partial inhibitor with an IC50 of 2 μm, while clastolactacystin β-lactone was a complete inhibitor with an IC50 of 10 μm. The nonselective kinase inhibitor K252a completely inhibited both IL-1 and TNFα stimulation in both cell types with an IC50 of 0.4 μm. This concentration, determined after a 20-min stimulation, was shown to be comparable with that obtained for inhibition of IL-6 production induced by a 100-fold lower IL-1 and TNFα concentration measured after 17 h of stimulation.

IL-11 and TNFα are two master cytokines that induce an almost identical proinflammatory response, including the production of chemotactic cytokines, adhesion molecules, and enzymes such as cyclooxygenase, nitric-oxide synthetase, and matrix metalloproteinases (1Dinarello C.A. Semin. Immunol. 1992; 4: 133-145PubMed Google Scholar, 2Arend W.P. Dayer J.-M. Arthritis Rheumatism. 1995; 38: 151-160Crossref PubMed Scopus (927) Google Scholar). Many of these effects are a result of the activation by both IL-1 and TNFα of the NF-κB transcription factor pathway, which is associated with the activation of many cellular defense genes (3Siebenlist U. Brown K. Franzoso G. Baeuerle P.A. Inducible Gene Expression. Birkhauser, Boston1995: 93-141Google Scholar, 4Baldwin Jr., A.S. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 1996; 14: 649-681Crossref PubMed Scopus (5546) Google Scholar). Composed of p65 (RelA) and p50 proteins, NF-κB is normally present in the cytoplasm in an inactive state in a complex with members of the IκB inhibitor protein family, chiefly the 37-kDa IκBα form. In this complexed form, a nuclear localization sequence found on NF-κB is masked by the IκBα, preventing nuclear translocation of NF-κB, DNA binding, and subsequent transcriptional activation (5Baeuerle P.A.

IL-1 or TNFα receptor activation induces within several minutes the specific phosphorylation of Ser32 and Ser36 on IκBα, the destruction of the phosphorylated IκBα protein by proteasomes, and the translocation of NF-κB to the nucleus (13Beg A.A.

Recent reports have identified an IL-1- and TNFα-activated Ser/Thr kinase cascade containing at least four kinases that serially phosphorylate each other prior to the phosphorylation of IκBα (reviewed in Refs. 18Baeuerle P.A.

Today. 1998; 19: 80-88Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1044) Google Scholar). The inhibition of proteasome activity by specific inhibitors as LLL-H (MG132) prevented both the destruction of IκBα as well as the subsequent activation of NF-κB as measured by the production of NF-κB-dependent proteins such as leukocyte adhesion proteins (20Palombella V.J.

Immunity. 1995; 2: 493-506Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (310) Google Scholar).Cellular assays of the early signaling events leading up to NF-κB activation are difficult because of the rapidity and complexity of the protein interactions. To show activation of NF-κB, electrophoretic mobility shift assays are typically performed to look at the specific binding of activated NF-κB to DNA (5Baeuerle P.A. Baltimore D. Cell. 1988; 53: 211-217Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (793) Google Scholar, 7Shirakawa F. Mizel S.B. Mol. Cell.

Nucleic Acids Res. 1981; 9: 3047-3060Crossref PubMed Scopus (1205) Google Scholar), but this technique requires relatively large numbers of cells and is laboriously quantitative, and the assay is not performed in intact cells. In contrast, the use of gene reporter constructs in transfected cells measures a response occurring hours after cell activation, and the resulting gene transcription is influenced by other transcription factors that act cooperatively to activate individual genes (12Siebenlist U. Franzoso G. Brown K. Annu. Rev. Cell Biol. 1994; 10: 405-455Crossref PubMed Scopus (2010) Google Scholar, 23Thanos D. Maniatis T. Cell. 1995; 80: 529-532Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1216) Google Scholar). Because protein translocation from the cytoplasm to nucleus can be readily visualized by immunocytolocalization (see e.g. Refs.9Henkel T. Zabel U. van Zee K. Muller J.M. Fanning E. Baeuerle P.A.

Nature. 1996; 382: 370-373Crossref PubMed Scopus (430) Google Scholar), a computerized cytometric fluorescence system, termed the ArrayScan™, has been developed to analyze translocation of cytoplasmic proteins in cells grown in 96-well plates (26Giuliano K.A. DeBiasio R.L. Dunlay R.T. Gough A. Volosky J.M. Zock J. Pavlakis G.N. Taylor D.L. J. Biomol. Screening. 1997; 2: 249-259Crossref Scopus (186) Google Scholar). We have used this ArrayScan™ system to quantitate the rate and extent of NF-κB translocation following stimulation of varying IL-1 and TNFα concentrations. We show that in human chondrocytes and HeLa cells complete translocation of NF-κB occurs within 10–20 min, with a half-time several minutes following that of IκBα destruction. Furthermore, the effects of receptor agonists and antagonists and kinase and proteasome inhibitors can be differentially quantitated.DISCUSSIONIn the present paper, we describe a new technique for quantitation of early events in IL-1 and TNFα signal transduction in intact cells by measuring translocation of NF-κB from cytoplasm to the nucleus. Cellular analysis of NF-κB translocation is performed within 20 min following the synchronized stimulation of cells with IL-1 and TNFα. This rapid response focuses on just the process leading up to the appearance of NF-κB in the nucleus prior to any nuclear binding and expression of its transcription activity. The assay thus reduces the number of postreceptor, intracellular signaling steps affecting the measurement to those of the kinase and adaptor protein cascade producing IκBα phosphorylation, the IκBα destruction by proteasomes, and the unknown factors enabling nuclear entry of NF-κB. As is shown in this report, ArrayScan™ analysis of NF-κB translocation is highly quantitative, sensitive, and reproducible. The low coefficient of variation (6.8%) for repeatedly scanning the same wells (but different fields of cells) indicates the ability of the system to extract statistically similar data from a number of fields in the same well. The analysis of variance indicated that this nuclear translocation technique was robust and produced only a minimal variation between rows and between plates regardless of whether they were analyzed on the same or successive days. Assay, plate, and day variability (Table II) were similar to those obtained for other cell-based assay formats currently used in compound screening. ArrayScan™ analysis is also rapid, taking less than 1 h to scan 75 cells/well in a 96-well plate. Furthermore, determination of protein distribution can be made on native, untransfected cells using fixation and staining such as that described here, or dynamic analysis can be performed in living cells in which proteins of interest are labeled with a fluorescent probe such as green fluorescent protein attached to receptors like the glucocorticoid receptor (26Giuliano K.A.

Hager G.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 4845-4850Crossref PubMed Scopus (326) Google Scholar) or to other transcription factors such as NF-AT (25Shibasaki F. Price E.R. Milan D. McKeon F. Nature. 1996; 382: 370-373Crossref PubMed Scopus (430) Google Scholar).Previously, NF-κB translocation was chiefly identified indirectly by electrophoretic mobility shift assays where measurement could only occur following subsequent NF-κB binding to DNA, and quantitation could only be made following cellular lysis, fractionation, and separation by gel electrophoresis (5Baeuerle P.A. Baltimore D. Cell. 1988; 53: 211-217Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (793) Google Scholar, 7Shirakawa F. Mizel S.B. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1989; 9: 2424-2430Crossref PubMed Scopus (301) Google Scholar, 22Garner M.M. Revsin A. Nucleic Acids Res. 1981; 9: 3047-3060Crossref PubMed Scopus (1205) Google Scholar). Such a technique is tedious, multistep, and subject to artifacts of protein partitioning and separation (36Baeuerle P.A. Baltimore C. Science. 1994; 242: 540-546Crossref Scopus (1611) Google Scholar). Analysis with the present ArrayScan™ technique preserves the spatial distribution of proteins within the cell without disruption. Electrophoretic mobility shift assay measurement is also subject to the influences on other components of the transcription apparatus that are necessary for NF-κB binding to the DNA (37Tjian R. Maniatis T. Cell. 1994; 77: 5-8Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (953) Google Scholar). Hence, results of electrophoretic mobility shift assay analysis may reflect the influences of a number of signaling pathways rather than that of NF-κB alone. On the other hand, with the ArrayScan™ measurement of NF-κB at an earlier stage in signaling, the comparison of results by ArrayScan™ analysis with that of measurement of transcriptional activity of NF-κB may enable a clearer understanding of those events activating NF-κB in the nucleus such as phosphorylation (38Zhong H. SuYang H. Erdjument-Bromage H. Tempst P. Ghosh S. Cell. 1997; 89: 413-424Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (725) Google Scholar).As is shown here, IL-1- or TNFα-stimulated nuclear NF-κB translocation begins within 2–4 min following the phosphorylation of IκBα, which is initiated 1–2 min after stimulation (see also Ref.28Yamin T.-T. Miller D.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 21540-21547Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (244) Google Scholar). The half-time for nuclear NF-κB translocation occurs at about 7–12 min, depending on the cell type, and occurs about 4–5 min following IκBα degradation. This time course is comparable for both IL-1 and TNFα activation despite the differences in the nature of the receptors and the different adaptor proteins involved (see Ref. 18Baeuerle P.A. Curr. Biol. 1998; 8: R19-R22Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The NF-κB translocation occurs gradually and uniformly in the entire cell population during the course of the cytokine stimulation. Only a small amount of the entire pool of NF-κB in the cytoplasm translocates despite the proteolysis of essentially all of the associated IκBα; the cytoplasmic fluorescence decreases by only 20% following stimulation (Fig. 5). This observation is comparable with earlier observations in which only 10–20% of the cytoplasmic NF-κB was observed to translocate (11Verma I.M. Stevenson J.K. Schwarz E.M. Van Antwerp D. Miyamoto S. Genes Dev. 1995; 9: 2723-2735Crossref PubMed Scopus (1654) Google Scholar). One might consider an alternative scenario producing the same average nuclear/cytoplasmic difference in which say only 50% of the cells responded but where the amount of the NF-κB translocation in those cells was twice as much. If this were the case, however, then the S.D. in the nuclear/cytoplasmic difference values would be increased over the course of the translocation. This increase is not seen; the S.D. between cells is constant during the entire translocation (data not shown).Both IL-1 and TNFα produce a maximal response when incubated at about 10 ng/ml (0.6 nm), but they show substantial differences in the concentrations for half-maximal response; whereas IL-1 titrates over about 1.5 logs with an ED50 of about 2 ng/ml, the TNFα titrates over 3 logs with an ED50 of about 0.15 ng/ml (Fig. 8). These titrations in NF-κB nuclear translocation are comparable with other cellular responses induced by both IL-1 (see Fig. 13) and TNFα (see Ref. 39Engelmann H. Holtmann H. Brakebusch C. Avni Y.S.

Precisely why TNFα is effective in receptor ligation and cell stimulation over such an extended concentration range is unknown but is perhaps a function of its trimeric nature (43Aggarwal B.B.

The antagonism of the IL-1 response by IL-1RA as measured in the ArrayScan™ faithfully replicates its antagonism of IL-1 receptor binding, where in both cases roughly a 100-fold excess of IL-1RA is needed for antagonism. The agonism induced by the aggregation of the TNFR1 molecules by the polyclonal antiTNFR1 mimics the TNFα response as reported earlier (39Engelmann H. Holtmann H. Brakebusch C. Avni Y.S. Sarov I. Nophar Y. Hadas E. Leitner O. Wallach D. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 14497-14504Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), but quantitation by the ArrayScan™ shows that this agonism is only partial and is mixed with partial antagonism.In this paper, we discuss the effects of inhibitors of NF-κB translocation at two measurable stages following receptor activation: at the level of the kinase signaling cascade and at the level of proteosome involvement in IκBα destruction and liberation of NF-κB. The nonspecific kinase inhibitor K252a (46Ruegg U.T. Burgess G.M. Trends Pharmacol. Sci. 1989; 10: 218-220Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (838) Google Scholar) has been shown to inhibit NF-κB activation (47Sonoda Y. Kasahara T. Yamaguchi Y. Kuno K. Matsushima K. Mukaida N. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 15366-15372Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar), and the closely related compound K252b inhibits both the IL-1 receptor association kinase and the phosphorylation of IκBα (28Yamin T.-T. Miller D.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 21540-21547Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (244) Google Scholar). As is shown in Fig. 13, K252a inhibits TNFα signaling equally well as IL-1 signaling, indicating that it must inhibit other kinases in the NF-κB activation cascade that are common to both stimulators. As expected from the necessary role for proteasomes in the degradation of phospho-IκBα prior to NF-κB nuclear translocation, proteasome inhibitors such as LLL-H (20Palombella V.J. Rando O.J. Goldberg A.L. Maniatis T. Cell. 1994; 78: 773-785Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1915) Google Scholar) and lactacystin (48Fenteany G. Schreiber S.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 8545-8548Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (383) Google Scholar) equally prevent both IL-1 and TNFα-induced cell activation (Fig. 12). Because of the ease of quantitation of the NF-κB translocation in the ArrayScan™, however, subtle differences between the two proteasome inhibitors can be seen such that LLL-H gives only partial inhibition of NF-κB translocation, while the lactacystin analog clastolactacystin β-lactone gives complete inhibition in both HeLa and chondrocyte cells. This suggests that there may be at least two subsets of proteasomes operating in these cells with only one of them inhibited by LLL-H. Such an interpretation is supported by recent evidence that cells resistant to LLL-based proteasome inhibitors, lacking enzymatic activity associated with this class of proteasomes, can still process substrates such as peptides for assembly of class I histocompatibility antigens. These resistant cells contain a different high molecular weight proteasome-like complex with a different substrate specificity (49Glas R. Bogyo M. McMaster J.S. Gaczynska M. Ploegh H.L. Nature. 1998; 392: 618-622Crossref PubMed Scopus (236) Google Scholar). IL-11 and TNFα are two master cytokines that induce an almost identical proinflammatory response, including the production of chemotactic cytokines, adhesion molecules, and enzymes such as cyclooxygenase, nitric-oxide synthetase, and matrix metalloproteinases (1Dinarello C.A. Semin. Immunol. 1992; 4: 133-145PubMed Google Scholar, 2Arend W.P. Dayer J.-M. Arthritis Rheumatism. 1995; 38: 151-160Crossref PubMed Scopus (927) Google Scholar). Many of these effects are a result of the activation by both IL-1 and TNFα of the NF-κB transcription factor pathway, which is associated with the activation of many cellular defense genes (3Siebenlist U. Brown K. Franzoso G. Baeuerle P.A. Inducible Gene Expression. Birkhauser, Boston1995: 93-141Google Scholar, 4Baldwin Jr., A.S. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 1996; 14: 649-681Crossref PubMed Scopus (5546) Google Scholar). Composed of p65 (RelA) and p50 proteins, NF-κB is normally present in the cytoplasm in an inactive state in a complex with members of the IκB inhibitor protein family, chiefly the 37-kDa IκBα form. In this complexed form, a nuclear localization sequence found on NF-κB is masked by the IκBα, preventing nuclear translocation of NF-κB, DNA binding, and subsequent transcriptional activation (5Baeuerle P.A.

IL-1 or TNFα receptor activation induces within several minutes the specific phosphorylation of Ser32 and Ser36 on IκBα, the destruction of the phosphorylated IκBα protein by proteasomes, and the translocation of NF-κB to the nucleus (13Beg A.A.

Biol. 1996; 16: 1295-1304Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Recent reports have identified an IL-1- and TNFα-activated Ser/Thr kinase cascade containing at least four kinases that serially phosphorylate each other prior to the phosphorylation of IκBα (reviewed in Refs. 18Baeuerle P.A. Curr. Biol. 1998; 8: R19-R22Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar and 19May M.J. Ghosh S. Immunol. Today. 1998; 19: 80-88Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1044) Google Scholar). The inhibition of proteasome activity by specific inhibitors as LLL-H (MG132) prevented both the destruction of IκBα as well as the subsequent activation of NF-κB as measured by the production of NF-κB-dependent proteins such as leukocyte adhesion proteins (20Palombella V.J. Rando O.J. Goldberg A.L. Maniatis T. Cell. 1994; 78: 773-785Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1915) Google Scholar, 21Read M.A. Neish A.S. Luscinskas F.W. Palombella V.J. Maniatis T. Collins T. Immunity. 1995; 2: 493-506Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (310) Google Scholar). Cellular assays of the early signaling events leading up to NF-κB activation are difficult because of the rapidity and complexity of the protein interactions. To show activation of NF-κB, electrophoretic mobility shift assays are typically performed to look at the specific binding of activated NF-κB to DNA (5Baeuerle P.A. Baltimore D. Cell. 1988; 53: 211-217Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (793) Google Scholar, 7Shirakawa F. Mizel S.B. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1989; 9: 2424-2430Crossref PubMed Scopus (301) Google Scholar, 22Garner M.M. Revsin A. Nucleic Acids Res. 1981; 9: 3047-3060Crossref PubMed Scopus (1205) Google Scholar), but this technique requires relatively large numbers of cells and is laboriously quantitative, and the assay is not performed in intact cells. In contrast, the use of gene reporter constructs in transfected cells measures a response occurring hours after cell activation, and the resulting gene transcription is influenced by other transcription factors that act cooperatively to activate individual genes (12Siebenlist U. Franzoso G. Brown K. Annu. Rev. Cell Biol. 1994; 10: 405-455Crossref PubMed Scopus (2010) Google Scholar, 23Thanos D. Maniatis T. Cell. 1995; 80: 529-532Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1216) Google Scholar). Because protein translocation from the cytoplasm to nucleus can be readily visualized by immunocytolocalization (see e.g. Refs.9Henkel T. Zabel U. van Zee K. Muller J.M. Fanning E. Baeuerle P.A. Cell. 1992; 68: 1121-1133Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (302) Google Scholar, 10Zabel U. Henkel T. dos Santos Silva M. Baeuerle P.A.

Science. 1995; 270: 286-290Crossref PubMed Scopus (2143) Google Scholar, and 25Shibasaki F. Price E.R. Milan D. McKeon F. Nature. 1996; 382: 370-373Crossref PubMed Scopus (430) Google Scholar), a computerized cytometric fluorescence system, termed the ArrayScan™, has been developed to analyze translocation of cytoplasmic proteins in cells grown in 96-well plates (26Giuliano K.A. DeBiasio R.L. Dunlay R.T. Gough A. Volosky J.M. Zock J. Pavlakis G.N. Taylor D.L. J. Biomol. Screening. 1997; 2: 249-259Crossref Scopus (186) Google Scholar). We have used this ArrayScan™ system to quantitate the rate and extent of NF-κB translocation following stimulation of varying IL-1 and TNFα concentrations. We show that in human chondrocytes and HeLa cells complete translocation of NF-κB occurs within 10–20 min, with a half-time several minutes following that of IκBα destruction. Furthermore, the effects of receptor agonists and antagonists and kinase and proteasome inhibitors can be differentially quantitated. DISCUSSIONIn the present paper, we describe a new technique for quantitation of early events in IL-1 and TNFα signal transduction in intact cells by measuring translocation of NF-κB from cytoplasm to the nucleus. Cellular analysis of NF-κB translocation is performed within 20 min following the synchronized stimulation of cells with IL-1 and TNFα. This rapid response focuses on just the process leading up to the appearance of NF-κB in the nucleus prior to any nuclear binding and expression of its transcription activity. The assay thus reduces the number of postreceptor, intracellular signaling steps affecting the measurement to those of the kinase and adaptor protein cascade producing IκBα phosphorylation, the IκBα destruction by proteasomes, and the unknown factors enabling nuclear entry of NF-κB. As is shown in this report, ArrayScan™ analysis of NF-κB translocation is highly quantitative, sensitive, and reproducible. The low coefficient of variation (6.8%) for repeatedly scanning the same wells (but different fields of cells) indicates the ability of the system to extract statistically similar data from a number of fields in the same well. The analysis of variance indicated that this nuclear translocation technique was robust and produced only a minimal variation between rows and between plates regardless of whether they were analyzed on the same or successive days. Assay, plate, and day variability (Table II) were similar to those obtained for other cell-based assay formats currently used in compound screening. ArrayScan™ analysis is also rapid, taking less than 1 h to scan 75 cells/well in a 96-well plate. Furthermore, determination of protein distribution can be made on native, untransfected cells using fixation and staining such as that described here, or dynamic analysis can be performed in living cells in which proteins of interest are labeled with a fluorescent probe such as green fluorescent protein attached to receptors like the glucocorticoid receptor (26Giuliano K.A. DeBiasio R.L. Dunlay R.T. Gough A. Volosky J.M. Zock J. Pavlakis G.N. Taylor D.L. J. Biomol. Screening. 1997; 2: 249-259Crossref Scopus (186) Google Scholar, 35Htun H. Barsony J. Renyi I. Gould D.L. Hager G.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 4845-4850Crossref PubMed Scopus (326) Google Scholar) or to other transcription factors such as NF-AT (25Shibasaki F. Price E.R. Milan D. McKeon F. Nature. 1996; 382: 370-373Crossref PubMed Scopus (430) Google Scholar).Previously, NF-κB translocation was chiefly identified indirectly by electrophoretic mobility shift assays where measurement could only occur following subsequent NF-κB binding to DNA, and quantitation could only be made following cellular lysis, fractionation, and separation by gel electrophoresis (5Baeuerle P.A. Baltimore D. Cell. 1988; 53: 211-217Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (793) Google Scholar, 7Shirakawa F. Mizel S.B. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1989; 9: 2424-2430Crossref PubMed Scopus (301) Google Scholar, 22Garner M.M. Revsin A. Nucleic Acids Res. 1981; 9: 3047-3060Crossref PubMed Scopus (1205) Google Scholar). Such a technique is tedious, multistep, and subject to artifacts of protein partitioning and separation (36Baeuerle P.A. Baltimore C. Science. 1994; 242: 540-546Crossref Scopus (1611) Google Scholar). Analysis with the present ArrayScan™ technique preserves the spatial distribution of proteins within the cell without disruption. Electrophoretic mobility shift assay measurement is also subject to the influences on other components of the transcription apparatus that are necessary for NF-κB binding to the DNA (37Tjian R. Maniatis T. Cell. 1994; 77: 5-8Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (953) Google Scholar). Hence, results of electrophoretic mobility shift assay analysis may reflect the influences of a number of signaling pathways rather than that of NF-κB alone. On the other hand, with the ArrayScan™ measurement of NF-κB at an earlier stage in signaling, the comparison of results by ArrayScan™ analysis with that of measurement of transcriptional activity of NF-κB may enable a clearer understanding of those events activating NF-κB in the nucleus such as phosphorylation (38Zhong H. SuYang H. Erdjument-Bromage H. Tempst P. Ghosh S. Cell. 1997; 89: 413-424Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (725) Google Scholar).As is shown here, IL-1- or TNFα-stimulated nuclear NF-κB translocation begins within 2–4 min following the phosphorylation of IκBα, which is initiated 1–2 min after stimulation (see also Ref.28Yamin T.-T. Miller D.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 21540-21547Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (244) Google Scholar). The half-time for nuclear NF-κB translocation occurs at about 7–12 min, depending on the cell type, and occurs about 4–5 min following IκBα degradation. This time course is comparable for both IL-1 and TNFα activation despite the differences in the nature of the receptors and the different adaptor proteins involved (see Ref. 18Baeuerle P.A. Curr. Biol. 1998; 8: R19-R22Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The NF-κB translocation occurs gradually and uniformly in the entire cell population during the course of the cytokine stimulation. Only a small amount of the entire pool of NF-κB in the cytoplasm translocates despite the proteolysis of essentially all of the associated IκBα; the cytoplasmic fluorescence decreases by only 20% following stimulation (Fig. 5). This observation is comparable with earlier observations in which only 10–20% of the cytoplasmic NF-κB was observed to translocate (11Verma I.M. Stevenson J.K. Schwarz E.M. Van Antwerp D. Miyamoto S. Genes Dev. 1995; 9: 2723-2735Crossref PubMed Scopus (1654) Google Scholar). One might consider an alternative scenario producing the same average nuclear/cytoplasmic difference in which say only 50% of the cells responded but where the amount of the NF-κB translocation in those cells was twice as much. If this were the case, however, then the S.D. in the nuclear/cytoplasmic difference values would be increased over the course of the translocation. This increase is not seen; the S.D. between cells is constant during the entire translocation (data not shown).Both IL-1 and TNFα produce a maximal response when incubated at about 10 ng/ml (0.6 nm), but they show substantial differences in the concentrations for half-maximal response; whereas IL-1 titrates over about 1.5 logs with an ED50 of about 2 ng/ml, the TNFα titrates over 3 logs with an ED50 of about 0.15 ng/ml (Fig. 8). These titrations in NF-κB nuclear translocation are comparable with other cellular responses induced by both IL-1 (see Fig. 13) and TNFα (see Ref. 39Engelmann H. Holtmann H. Brakebusch C. Avni Y.S.

Raju, unpublished observations. and TNFα (42Aggarwal B.B. Eessalu T.E. Hass P.E. Nature. 1985; 318: 665-667Crossref PubMed Scopus (740) Google Scholar). Precisely why TNFα is effective in receptor ligation and cell stimulation over such an extended concentration range is unknown but is perhaps a function of its trimeric nature (43Aggarwal B.B.

The antagonism of the IL-1 response by IL-1RA as measured in the ArrayScan™ faithfully replicates its antagonism of IL-1 receptor binding, where in both cases roughly a 100-fold excess of IL-1RA is needed for antagonism. The agonism induced by the aggregation of the TNFR1 molecules by the polyclonal antiTNFR1 mimics the TNFα response as reported earlier (39Engelmann H. Holtmann H. Brakebusch C. Avni Y.S. Sarov I.

Biol. 1989; 9: 2424-2430Crossref PubMed Scopus (301) Google Scholar, 22Garner M.M. Revsin A. Nucleic Acids Res. 1981; 9: 3047-3060Crossref PubMed Scopus (1205) Google Scholar). Such a technique is tedious, multistep, and subject to artifacts of protein partitioning and separation (36Baeuerle P.A. Baltimore C. Science. 1994; 242: 540-546Crossref Scopus (1611) Google Scholar). Analysis with the present ArrayScan™ technique preserves the spatial distribution of proteins within the cell without disruption. Electrophoretic mobility shift assay measurement is also subject to the influences on other components of the transcription apparatus that are necessary for NF-κB binding to the DNA (37Tjian R. Maniatis T. Cell. 1994; 77: 5-8Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (953) Google Scholar). Hence, results of electrophoretic mobility shift assay analysis may reflect the influences of a number of signaling pathways rather than that of NF-κB alone. On the other hand, with the ArrayScan™ measurement of NF-κB at an earlier stage in signaling, the comparison of results by ArrayScan™ analysis with that of measurement of transcriptional activity of NF-κB may enable a clearer understanding of those events activating NF-κB in the nucleus such as phosphorylation (38Zhong H. SuYang H. Erdjument-Bromage H. Tempst P. Ghosh S. Cell. 1997; 89: 413-424Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (725) Google Scholar). As is shown here, IL-1- or TNFα-stimulated nuclear NF-κB translocation begins within 2–4 min following the phosphorylation of IκBα, which is initiated 1–2 min after stimulation (see also Ref.28Yamin T.-T. Miller D.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 21540-21547Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (244) Google Scholar). The half-time for nuclear NF-κB translocation occurs at about 7–12 min, depending on the cell type, and occurs about 4–5 min following IκBα degradation. This time course is comparable for both IL-1 and TNFα activation despite the differences in the nature of the receptors and the different adaptor proteins involved (see Ref. 18Baeuerle P.A. Curr. Biol. 1998; 8: R19-R22Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The NF-κB translocation occurs gradually and uniformly in the entire cell population during the course of the cytokine stimulation. Only a small amount of the entire pool of NF-κB in the cytoplasm translocates despite the proteolysis of essentially all of the associated IκBα; the cytoplasmic fluorescence decreases by only 20% following stimulation (Fig. 5). This observation is comparable with earlier observations in which only 10–20% of the cytoplasmic NF-κB was observed to translocate (11Verma I.M. Stevenson J.K. Schwarz E.M. Van Antwerp D. Miyamoto S. Genes Dev. 1995; 9: 2723-2735Crossref PubMed Scopus (1654) Google Scholar). One might consider an alternative scenario producing the same average nuclear/cytoplasmic difference in which say only 50% of the cells responded but where the amount of the NF-κB translocation in those cells was twice as much. If this were the case, however, then the S.D. in the nuclear/cytoplasmic difference values would be increased over the course of the translocation. This increase is not seen; the S.D. between cells is constant during the entire translocation (data not shown). Both IL-1 and TNFα produce a maximal response when incubated at about 10 ng/ml (0.6 nm), but they show substantial differences in the concentrations for half-maximal response; whereas IL-1 titrates over about 1.5 logs with an ED50 of about 2 ng/ml, the TNFα titrates over 3 logs with an ED50 of about 0.15 ng/ml (Fig. 8). These titrations in NF-κB nuclear translocation are comparable with other cellular responses induced by both IL-1 (see Fig. 13) and TNFα (see Ref. 39Engelmann H. Holtmann H. Brakebusch C. Avni Y.S. Sarov I. Nophar Y. Hadas E. Leitner O. Wallach D. J. Biol.

Raju, unpublished observations. and TNFα (42Aggarwal B.B. Eessalu T.E. Hass P.E. Nature. 1985; 318: 665-667Crossref PubMed Scopus (740) Google Scholar). Precisely why TNFα is effective in receptor ligation and cell stimulation over such an extended concentration range is unknown but is perhaps a function of its trimeric nature (43Aggarwal B.B. Kohr W.J. Hass P.E. Moffat B. Spencer S.A. Henzel W.J. Bringman T.S. Nedwin G.E. Goeddel D.V. Harkins R.N. J. Biol.

Remy R. Poschl B. van Loon A.P.G.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 15183-15188Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The antagonism of the IL-1 response by IL-1RA as measured in the ArrayScan™ faithfully replicates its antagonism of IL-1 receptor binding, where in both cases roughly a 100-fold excess of IL-1RA is needed for antagonism. The agonism induced by the aggregation of the TNFR1 molecules by the polyclonal antiTNFR1 mimics the TNFα response as reported earlier (39Engelmann H. Holtmann H. Brakebusch C. Avni Y.S. Sarov I. Nophar Y. Hadas E. Leitner O. Wallach D. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 14497-14504Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), but quantitation by the ArrayScan™ shows that this agonism is only partial and is mixed with partial antagonism. In this paper, we discuss the effects of inhibitors of NF-κB translocation at two measurable stages following receptor activation: at the level of the kinase signaling cascade and at the level of proteosome involvement in IκBα destruction and liberation of NF-κB. The nonspecific kinase inhibitor K252a (46Ruegg U.T. Burgess G.M. Trends Pharmacol. Sci. 1989; 10: 218-220Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (838) Google Scholar) has been shown to inhibit NF-κB activation (47Sonoda Y. Kasahara T. Yamaguchi Y. Kuno K. Matsushima K. Mukaida N. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 15366-15372Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar), and the closely related compound K252b inhibits both the IL-1 receptor association kinase and the phosphorylation of IκBα (28Yamin T.-T. Miller D.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 21540-21547Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (244) Google Scholar). As is shown in Fig. 13, K252a inhibits TNFα signaling equally well as IL-1 signaling, indicating that it must inhibit other kinases in the NF-κB activation cascade that are common to both stimulators. As expected from the necessary role for proteasomes in the degradation of phospho-IκBα prior to NF-κB nuclear translocation, proteasome inhibitors such as LLL-H (20Palombella V.J. Rando O.J. Goldberg A.L. Maniatis T. Cell. 1994; 78: 773-785Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1915) Google Scholar) and lactacystin (48Fenteany G. Schreiber S.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 8545-8548Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (383) Google Scholar) equally prevent both IL-1 and TNFα-induced cell activation (Fig. 12). Because of the ease of quantitation of the NF-κB translocation in the ArrayScan™, however, subtle differences between the two proteasome inhibitors can be seen such that LLL-H gives only partial inhibition of NF-κB translocation, while the lactacystin analog clastolactacystin β-lactone gives complete inhibition in both HeLa and chondrocyte cells. This suggests that there may be at least two subsets of proteasomes operating in these cells with only one of them inhibited by LLL-H. Such an interpretation is supported by recent evidence that cells resistant to LLL-based proteasome inhibitors, lacking enzymatic activity associated with this class of proteasomes, can still process substrates such as peptides for assembly of class I histocompatibility antigens. These resistant cells contain a different high molecular weight proteasome-like complex with a different substrate specificity (49Glas R. Bogyo M. McMaster J.S. Gaczynska M. Ploegh H.L.

Trans. 1990; 18: 1132-1135Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). In liver and kidney, pyruvate and lactate produced by peripheral tissues are converted back to glucose through the gluconeogenic pathway (4Voet D. Voet J.G. Biochemistry. John Wiley & Sons, Inc., New York1990: 599-606Google Scholar). On the other hand, tissues with few or no mitochondria, such as erythrocytes and tumor cells, depend largely on glycolysis to generate ATP. The major end products of this metabolic pathway, pyruvate and lactate, are therefore produced in quantity and must be eliminated from the cells to enable continued glycolytic flux and prevent toxic effects in the cells (5Halestrap A.P. Biochem. J. 1976; 156: 181-183Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). Similarly, under conditions of hypoxia (6Halestrap A.P. Wang X. Poole R.C. Jackson V.N. Price N.T. Am. J. Cardiol. 1997; 80: 17A-25AAbstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar, 7Schurr A. Payne R.S. Miller J.J. Rigor B.M. J. Neurochem. 1997; 69: 423-426Crossref PubMed Scopus (226) Google Scholar), the rate of glycolysis increases prominently in muscle in an effort to generate ATP to drive contraction, and it is critical for the cell to efflux the lactate to avoid intracellular acidosis. It is now widely accepted that the transport of lactate and pyruvate is mediated by a family of H+/monocarboxylate transporters, MCTs,1 named for their characteristic substrate specificity for short chain monocarboxylates (1Poole R.C. Halestrap A.P. Am. J. Physiol. 1993; 264: C761-C782Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The MCTs share substrate specificity, have a characteristic stereoselectivity for the L isomer of lactate, and are inhibited by α-cyanocinnamate derivatives and by less specific anion transporter blockers such as stilbene disulfonates and phloretin. Pyruvate and lactate transport are accelerated at acid pH, implying a mechanism of H+/monocarboxylate cotransporter (reviewed in Ref. 1Poole R.C. Halestrap A.P. Am. J. Physiol. 1993; 264: C761-C782Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Several isoforms of MCTs have been molecularly characterized and their tissue distribution described. Accumulating evidence has led to the notion that each isoform of the transporter may have slightly different kinetic and pharmacological properties related to the unique metabolic requirements of the tissues where it is localized (1Poole R.C. Halestrap A.P. Am. J. Physiol. 1993; 264: C761-C782Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 8Jackson V.N. Halestrap A.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 861-868Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar). The first monocarboxylate transporter (designated MCT1) was cloned from Chinese hamster ovary cells by Garcia et al. (9Garcia C.K. Goldstein J.L. Pathak R.K. Anderson R.G. Brown M.S. Cell. 1994; 76: 865-873Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (470) Google Scholar). MCT1 is a membrane-bound protein with 12 predicted transmembrane regions (9Garcia C.K. Goldstein J.L. Pathak R.K. Anderson R.G. Brown M.S. Cell. 1994; 76: 865-873Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (470) Google Scholar). The motif of the 12 transmembrane regions is shared by many other transporters, including p-glycoprotein (10Gottesman M.M. Pastan I. Annu. Rev.

MCT1 was not categorized as a member of the ABC (ATPBinding Cassette) super family of membrane transporter proteins (14Higgins C.F. Annu. Rev. Cell Biol. 1992; 8: 67-113Crossref PubMed Scopus (3375) Google Scholar) because of its lack of ATP-binding domains. MCT1 homologues were later cloned and sequenced from human, rat, and mouse and found to be highly conserved between species (15Garcia C.K. Li X. Luna J. Francke U.

A second isoform, named MCT2, was isolated from a Syrian hamster liver library that has ∼60% amino acid sequence identity with MCT1 (19Garcia C.K. Brown M.S. Pathak R.K. Goldstein J.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 1843-1849Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (307) Google Scholar). A rat MCT2 homologue was also cloned and sequenced (20Jackson V.N. Price N.T. Carpenter L. Halestrap A.P. Biochem. J. 1997; 324: 447-453Crossref PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar). Unlike MCT1, MCT2 appears to be less highly conserved between species (20Jackson V.N. Price N.T. Carpenter L. Halestrap A.P. Biochem. J. 1997; 324: 447-453Crossref PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar). Northern and Western blotting have shown that MCT1 is expressed in the majority of tissues examined in rodents (15Garcia C.K. Li X. Luna J. Francke U.

Goldstein J.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 1843-1849Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (307) Google Scholar). Recently, a third isoform of the MCT family, designated MCT3, was isolated from chicken retinal pigment epithelium (21Yoon H. Fanelli A. Grollman E.F. Philp N.J. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1997; 234: 90-94Crossref PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar). Its tissue distribution remains to be determined. Although much of our understanding of these transporters was derived from the studies of hamster MCTs, relatively little is known about the human monocarboxylate transporters at both biochemical and molecular levels. Human MCT1 cDNA has been isolated and its gene (gene symbol SLC16A1) mapped to chromosome bands 1p13.2-p12 (15Garcia C.K. Li X. Luna J. Francke U. Genomics. 1994; 23: 500-503Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). Detailed functional characterization and tissue distribution of human MCT1, however, has not yet been reported. In the present study, we report the cloning of the human monocarboxylate transporter MCT2 and provide a comparative characterization of the human MCT1 and MCT2 transporters expressed in Xenopus laevis oocytes. Because of its degree of sequence identity to hamster MCT2, human MCT2 may be presumed to have similar biological properties as its hamster homologue. Human MCT2, however, is novel because it has a high affinity for the transport of pyruvate (apparent K m of 25 μm), suggesting that it is a primary pyruvate transporter in man. Also, multiple mRNA transcripts of human MCT2 are detected (whereas there is only one mRNA species for hamster MCT2), implying a mechanism of alternative splicing or multiple promoters to generate the human MCT2 RNA variants. We also found differential expression of the human MCT2 mRNA between normal tissues and cancer cell lines, whereas no difference was seen among the transcripts of human MCT1, implying that human MCT2 may be pretranslationally regulated in neoplasia. Finally, we found co-expression of human MCT1 and MCT2 at the mRNA level in neoplastic hematopoietic lineage lines including HL60, K562, MOLT-4, and Burkitt's lymphoma Raji and in solid tumor cell lines such as SW480, A549, and G361. The presence of multiple MCTs is likely physiologically important in cancer cell lines. Sodium [2-14C]pyruvic acid (6.25 mCi/mmol) and sodium l-[2-3H]lactic acid (20 Ci/mmol) were obtained from American Radiolabeled Chemicals (St. Louis, MO). All other chemicals were purchased from Sigma. Complementary DNA encoding hamster MCT2 (GenBankTM/EBI Data Bank accession number L31957) was digested with NdeI, and the resulting two fragments (corresponding to nucleotides 220–925 and 925–1908) were used as templates to generate uniformly random primed, 32P-labeled probes. These probes were then used to screen a human liver 5′-stretch (oligo(dT)- and random primed) cDNA library in bacteriophage λgt10 (CLONTECH, Palo Alto, CA) (22Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, New York1989Google Scholar). Over one million plaques were transferred to replicate filters and probed at 60 °C with 2 × 106 cpm/ml of the probes using ExpressHyb hybridization solution (CLONTECH). The filters were washed under low stringency conditions, once in 2× SSC and 0.05% SDS at room temperature for 15 min and twice in 1× SSC and 0.1% SDS at room temperature for 30 min. Positive recombinant phage clones were plaque purified, and cDNAs were subcloned in the plasmid pGEM3Z (Promega) and pcDNA3 (Invitrogen) for further studies. cDNAs were sequenced using an Applied Biosystem 373A automated DNA sequencer and ABI 377 from Applied Biosystems. PCR extension was performed on a Perkin-Elmer 9600 using AmpliTaq DNA polymerase. The final sequence was confirmed from both strands using vector-specific or internal primers. Sequence comparisons and data base searches were performed using Lasergene Navigator (DNASTAR Inc., Madison, WI) and the BLAST program (23Altschul S.F. Gish W. Miller W. Myers E.W. Lipman D.J. J. Mol. Biol. 1990; 215: 403-410Crossref PubMed Scopus (70762) Google Scholar) provided by the NCBI server at the National Library of Medicine/National Institutes of Health. 500 ng of poly(A+) RNA from human liver (CLONTECH) was reverse transcribed using a Life Technologies, Inc. SuperScriptTM preamplification system for first strand cDNA synthesis. 1/10 of the product was subjected to PCR using vent polymerase. The 5′-oligonucleotide (5′-CTGAGGATCCCCACTAGAGGAGCAGAAATG-3′) introduced a 5′-BamHI restriction site and 20 downstream nucleotides that match nucleotides 145–164 in the human MCT2 cDNA sequence. The 3′-oligonucleotide (5′-ATCGCTCGAGATCAGAGATGTGATTCTTGT-3′) introduced a 3′-XhoI restriction site. The last 20 nucleotides of the 3′-oligonucleotide complement nucleotides 1598–1617 of the human MCT2 cDNA. The PCR conditions used were 35 cycles of 94 °C for 30 s, 57 °C for 1 min, followed by 74 °C for 1 min. Amplified cDNAs were digested with BamHI and XhoI and cloned into the vector pcDNA3, which was cleaved with the same restriction endonucleases. The identity of the amplified MCT2 cDNA fragment was confirmed by sequencing. The plasmid cDNA containing human MCT1 was obtained from the American Type Culture Collection (Manassas, VA) and linearized with BamHI, followed by in vitrotranscription using T7 RNA polymerase. The plasmid cDNA containing human MCT2 was linearized with XhoI digestion and transcribed in vitro using T7 RNA polymerase. All thein vitro transcription reactions were done in the presence of RNase inhibitors and the cap analog m7G(5′)ppp(5′)G (Ambion, Austin, TX). The resultant cRNA was phenol-chloroform extracted and isopropyl alcohol precipitated. RNA concentration was determined by UV spectrophotometry, and RNA integrity was verified by denaturing 1% formaldehyde-agarose gel electrophoresis. X. laevis oocytes (stages V-VI) were microinjected with 50 ng of cRNA of human MCT1 or MCT2 or water and maintained in Barth's solution at 18 °C for 3 days (24Dai G. Levy O. Carrasco N. Nature. 1996; 379: 458-460Crossref PubMed Scopus (971) Google Scholar). For transport studies, groups of three oocytes were incubated in the OR2 reaction mixture (15 mmHepes, 82.5 mm NaCl, 2.5 mm KCl, 1 mm Na2HPO4, and 1 mmMgCl2) containing [14C]pyruvate at room temperature. The initial velocities of pyruvate transport were determined at 5 min for various pyruvate concentrations (0.5–15 mm for MCT1 and 1–100 μm for MCT2). For substrate specificity and inhibitor studies, unlabeled compounds (10 and 1 mm for MCT1 and MCT2 studies, respectively) were included in the reaction mixture simultaneously. Nonspecific transport was determined in parallel experiments with water-injected oocytes. After incubation, transport was stopped by washing oocytes three times with 4 ml of ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline. Each oocyte was then lysed individually with 0.5% SDS. The incorporated radioactivity was determined by liquid scintillation counting. Multiple tissue RNA blots containing size-fractionated human poly(A+) RNAs (2 μg/lane) were obtained from CLONTECH. These blots were hybridized with 32P-labeled cDNA inserts corresponding to nucleotides 611–1490 of human MCT1 and nucleotides 1–1229 of human MCT2, respectively. Hybridization was carried out at highly stringent conditions at 68 °C for 1 h with ExpressHyb hybridization solution. The blots were washed three times at 50 °C in 0.1× SSC and 0.1% SDS. The blots were then exposed to XAR-5 film at −70 °C with two intensifying screens. Signals were visualized by autoradiography. The 1.9-kb full-length human MCT2 cDNA was used for chromosomal localization of the gene encoding MCT2. Localization was done by somatic cell hybrid analysis using a32P-labeled cDNA probe and by fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) using biotin-labeled cDNA. Mapping panel 2 (Coriell Cell Repository) consisting of monochromosomal hybrid cell lines obtained from the NIGMS, National Institutes of Health, was used for somatic cell hybrid analysis following conventional methods. FISH was employed for subregional localization following biotin-labeling of the MCT2 cDNA. Metaphase chromosome preparation,in situ hybridization, and detection of the labeled probe were performed as described previously (25Rao P.H. Murty V.V.V.S. Gaidano G. Hauptschein R. Dalla-Favera R. Chaganti R.S.K. Genomics. 1993; 16: 426-430Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). Separate images of hybridization signal and DAPI-stained chromosomes were captured using a cooled charge-coupled devise (CCD) camera (Photometrics, Tucson, AZ) and analyzed using the Smartcapture image analysis system (Vysis, Downers Grove, IL). To isolate the cDNA for human MCT2, a human liver cDNA library in bacteriophage λgt10 was screened with a32P-labeled cDNA probe corresponding to the entire coding region of hamster MCT2 under low stringency hybridization conditions. Over one million plaques were screened, and three weakly positive clones were purified and sequenced and found to contain overlapping cDNA sequences that were 75% identical to hamster MCT2. The longest cDNA was 1.9-kb in size and was chosen for functional expression. This clone was subsequently named human monocarboxylate transporter 2 (MCT2). The nucleotide and the derived amino acid sequences of human MCT2 are presented in Fig. 1 A. The isolated cDNA of human MCT2 is 1907 base pairs long, with a predicted open reading frame of 1,437 nucleotides, a 5′-untranslated region of 161 nucleotides, and a 3′-untranslated region of 309 nucleotides. The putative initiation codon ATG (nucleotides 162–164) lies within a consensus translation start site (26Kozak M. Nucleic Acids Res. 1987; 15: 8125-8148Crossref PubMed Scopus (4168) Google Scholar). Although the exact size of the 5′-untranslated region is unknown, the occurrence of an in-frame stop codon at nucleotides 138–140 precludes the possible utilization of a distal, upstream initiator ATG. Neither a poly(A) tail nor a polyadenylation signal was evident in the sequence, and therefore the length and complete sequence of the 3′-untranslated region remain to be determined. The open reading frame in Fig. 1 A reveals that human MCT2 comprises 478 amino acids and has a calculatedM r = 52,247. The protein is rich in hydrophobic amino acid residues (Ala, Ile, Leu, Phe, Trp, and Val), which account for 41% of the residues in the predicted sequence and may explain the migration pattern of the in vitro translated product of human MCT2 (apparent M r = 40,000) upon electrophoresis in SDS-polyacrylamide gel. 2R. Y. Lin and D. W. Golde, unpublished observations. As shown in Fig. 1 B, Kyte-Doolittle hydropathy analysis of the primary amino acid sequence of human MCT2 revealed the presence of 12 putative transmembrane domains with a lengthy hydrophilic segment between transmembrane domains 6 and 7. This pattern of hydropathy was nearly superimposable with MCT1 (15Garcia C.K. Li X. Luna J. Francke U. Genomics. 1994; 23: 500-503Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar, 16Carpenter L. Poole R.C.

J. 1997; 324: 447-453Crossref PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar). The amino acid sequence of human MCT2 exhibited 77% sequence identity to the hamster and 72% identity to the rat homologue (Fig. 2 A) (19Garcia C.K. Brown M.S. Pathak R.K. Goldstein J.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 1843-1849Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (307) Google Scholar, 20Jackson V.N. Price N.T. Carpenter L. Halestrap A.P. Biochem. J. 1997; 324: 447-453Crossref PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar). Human MCT2 also showed 49% sequence identity to human MCT1 (Fig. 2 B). Sequence identity between human MCT1 and MCT2 exists throughout the coding region. Most sequence conservation lies within the 12 predicted transmembrane regions. Most sequence divergence is found at the amino- and carboxyl-terminal ends and in the hydrophilic loop between the predicted transmembrane domains 6 and 7. To access the functional properties of human MCT2 and compare them to MCT1, [14C]pyruvate uptake was measured in X. laevis oocytes that express limited endogenous transport activity. Oocytes injected with cRNA derived from either human MCT1 or MCT2 exhibited a 5–10-fold higher [14C]pyruvate uptake than water-injected oocytes (data not shown). The transport of pyruvate was time-dependent and approximately linear in the first 20 min for both MCT1 and MCT2 (Fig. 3 A). A 5-min incubation time was used in subsequent experiments to estimate the initial velocities. Uptake of [14C]pyruvate by either MCT1 or MCT2 was saturable and conformed to simple Michaelis-Menten kinetics. Surprisingly, pyruvate transport in MCT1- or MCT2-expressing oocytes revealed strikingly different K m values. An apparentK m value of 2.5 mm for pyruvate was observed in human MCT1-expressing oocytes (Fig. 3 B, left panel), a value that is in agreement with previously published data regarding hamster MCT1 (19Garcia C.K. Brown M.S. Pathak R.K. Goldstein J.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 1843-1849Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (307) Google Scholar). The calculatedK m for human MCT2-expressing oocytes was 25 μm as determined by double reciprocal plot (Fig. 3 B, right panel). In contrast, the hamster MCT2 has a reported K m for pyruvate transport of 0.8 mm (19Garcia C.K. Brown M.S. Pathak R.K. Goldstein J.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 1843-1849Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (307) Google Scholar). Apparent K m values of 6.0 and 6.5 mm were determined for transport ofl-lactate in oocytes expressing human MCT1 and MCT2, respectively (data not shown), indicating that neither of the human transporters handles lactate at high affinity. Uptake of pyruvate by MCT1 or MCT2 was stimulated by decreasing the extracellular pH from 8.5 to 6.0 (Fig. 3 C). The rate of pyruvate uptake in MCT1 cRNA-injected oocytes increased by more than 1.5-fold when the extracellular pH was lowered from 8.5 to 6.0, whereas there was only a minor increase in the rate of pyruvate transport in water-injected oocytes. The rate of pyruvate uptake in MCT2 cRNA injected oocytes increased by 35 and 65%, respectively, when the pH was lowered from 8.5 to 7.5 and to 6.0. Together, these data suggest that both MCTs function as H+/monocarboxylate cotransporters. To investigate substrate specificity, we examined inhibition of MCT1- or MCT2-mediated [14C]pyruvate uptake by various unlabeled monocarboxylates (Fig. 3 D). At an extracellular concentration of 1 mm pyruvate, MCT1-mediated pyruvate transport was inhibited by 10-fold excess l-lactate (100% inhibition) and to a lesser extent by γ-hydroxybutyrate (85%),dl-α-hydroxybutyrate (78%) anddl-β-hydroxybutyrate (65%). Similarly, at an extracellular concentration of 15 μm pyruvate, MCT2-mediated pyruvate transport was strongly inhibited by a 60-fold excess of l-lactate (100% inhibition),dl-β-hydroxybutyrate (80%), and to a lesser extent, by γ-hydroxybutyrate (60%) and dl-α-hydroxybutyrate (55%). These results provided further evidence that both MCTs exhibit broad substrate specificity for unbranched aliphatic monocarboxylates. Human MCT1 and MCT2 also showed stereoselectivity for l- over d-lactate (Fig. 3 D). This stereospecific transport of the l-isomer of lactate is in good agreement with that of other MCTs as reported previously (1Poole R.C. Halestrap A.P. Am. J. Physiol. 1993; 264: C761-C782Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 27Deuticke B. J. Membr. Biol. 1982; 70: 89-103Crossref PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar, 28Deuticke B. Methods Enzymol. 1989; 173: 300-329Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). Deoxyglucose was used here as a negative control because it is not transported by MCTs (Fig. 3 D). Classical inhibitors of monocarboxylate transport such as α-cyanocinnamates decrease pyruvate uptake mediated by MCT1 and MCT2. Of the two α-cyanocinnamate compounds that we examined, α-cyano-3-hydroxycinnamate demonstrated more potent inhibitory effects than did α-cyano-4-hydroxycinnamate in MCT1-expressing oocytes, whereas α-cyano-4-hydroxycinnamate was found to be able to block more transport activity mediated by MCT2. Northern blots containing poly(A+) RNA from human tissues were probed with32P-labeled cDNAs corresponding to human MCT1 and MCT2 and processed under highly stringent conditions. A strong band indicating the 3.6-kb transcript of MCT1 was detected in heart tissue (Fig. 4 A). Other tissues found to express MCT1 included spinal cord, skeletal muscle, testis, ovary, placenta, small intestine, colon, prostate, thymus, spleen, liver, brain, stomach, thyroid, lymph node, trachea, adrenal gland and bone marrow. No hybridization signals were obtained with mRNA isolated from kidney, pancreas, lung, and leukocytes (Fig. 4 A). In contrast to the widely distributed MCT1 transcript, MCT2 mRNA showed substantial tissue restriction and appears to be more complicated. Three mRNAs of MCT2 from testis (ranging from 1.2- to 2.8-kilobases) yielded intense hybridization signals (Fig. 4 A). Moderate to low levels of longer transcripts (3.6 and 11 kb) were observed in RNA samples derived from spleen, heart, kidney, pancreas, skeletal muscle, brain, and leukocyte (Fig. 4 A). The lack of detection of MCT2 transcripts in liver, the tissue from which we cloned MCT2, is probably partially because of low abundance of MCT2 message and also related to limited quantities of RNA on the blot with respect to the hybridization signals for β-actin (Fig. 4 A). Liver has a relatively low abundance of MCT2 message compared with pancreas which also has low β-actin hybridization signals, but a strong human MCT2 hybridization signal. Using sequence-specific primers, we amplified the full-length MCT2 by reverse transcriptase-PCR from liver (Fig. 4 B). Of the tissues containing the two MCT2 transcripts (3.6- and 11.0-kb, respectively), the 11-kb mRNA is more abundant than the smaller 3.6-kb transcript. Southern blot analysis of human genomic DNA hybridized with32P-labeled probe corresponding to nucleotides 634–1096 in the MCT2 cDNA sequence yielded a simple pattern (data not shown), suggesting that human MCT2 is a single copy gene in the human genome. The Northern analysis therefore suggests that human MCT2 RNA transcripts undergo alternative splicing, or possibly multiple promoters drive transcription of the human MCT2 gene. Northern blot analysis of human cancer cell lines revealed that MCT1 mRNA was abundantly expressed in hematopoietic lineage lines HL60, K562, MOLT-4, and Burkitt's lymphoma Raji, representing myeloid, erythroid, and T- and B-lymphoid differentiation, respectively, and in epithelial tumor cell lines SW480, A549, and G361. MCT2 mRNA was also expressed in all the cell lines. In contrast to the human tissues where the longer, 11-kb transcript is the predominant species in tissues expressing it (except testis, Fig. 4 A), the smaller, 3.6-kb transcript appeared to be more abundant in the human cancer cells. Longer exposure of the same blot revealed the presence of a weak but clear 11-kb mRNA transcript in all the cell lines. The abundance of the two MCT2 transcripts is therefore differentially displayed between normal human tissues and cancer cell lines. It is worth noting that HL60 leukemia cells have an extra MCT2 transcript of 4.4 kb. Its function remains to be determined. Southern blotting of the cDNA probe to the monochromosomal somatic cell hybrid panel revealed a strong band in the lane containing human chromosome 12 without cross-hybridization in any other lane (data not shown). The result unambiguously assigned the human MCT2 gene to chromosome 12. For subregional assignment, normal human metaphase spreads were evaluated, following FISH of the biotin-labeled probe. In ten metaphases, twin hybridization spots were detected on both chromosome 12 homologues at band 12q13, thereby assigning the gene to this band (Fig. 5) Accumulating evidence has led to the notion that mammals express multiple isoforms of MCT. We isolated the human MCT2 cDNA by low stringency screening of a liver cDNA library. Western blot and immunohistochemical studies revealed the presence of MCT2 in hamster liver (19Garcia C.K. Brown M.S. Pathak R.K. Goldstein J.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 1843-1849Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (307) Google Scholar), and Jackson et al. (20Jackson V.N. Price N.T. Carpenter L. Halestrap A.P. Biochem. J. 1997; 324: 447-453Crossref PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar) reported the expression of an abundant 2.4-kb message of MCT2 in hamster and mouse liver by Northern blot analysis. We found that human liver, however, contains low abundance MCT2 message that can only be detected by reverse transcriptase-PCR. Contrasting results have also been reported concerning expression of MCT2 in the brain. Neither MCT1 nor MCT2 were detected in hamster brain by Western blot analysis (19Garcia C.K. Brown M.S. Pathak R.K. Goldstein J.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 1843-1849Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (307) Google Scholar). In contrast, Jackson et al. (20Jackson V.N. Price N.T. Carpenter L. Halestrap A.P. Biochem. J. 1997; 324: 447-453Crossref PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar) reported the expression of MCT2 mRNA in hamster brain but not in rat or mouse brain by Northern blot analysis (20Jackson V.N. Price N.T. Carpenter L. Halestrap A.P. Biochem. J. 1997; 324: 447-453Crossref PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar). Recently, Pellerin et al. (29Pellerin L. Pellegri G. Martin J.-L. Magistretti P.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci., U. S. A. 1998; 95: 3990-3995Crossref PubMed Scopus (246) Google Scholar) reported the presence of three transcripts for MCT2 in mouse brain. We found expression of MCT2 at the mRNA level in human heart, brain, kidney, spleen, pancreas, skeletal muscle, testis, and leukocytes. The tissue distribution of MCT2 therefore appears to be species-dependent. We also found three transcripts for MCT2 in human testis and two larger transcripts for MCT2 in other tissues. Human testis abundantly expresses both MCT1 and MCT2. The physiological significance of the unique MCT2 transcripts in testis is unknown. Previous immunohistochemical studies showed a cell-type-specific expression of MCT1 and MCT2 in the hamster male reproductive system. Hamster MCT1 was present on sperm heads in the testis and proximal epididymis and on the microvillar surface of the epithelium in the distal epididymis. In contrast, MCT2 was present on the tails of sperm throughout the testis and epididymis (19Garcia C.K. Brown M.S. Pathak R.K. Goldstein J.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 1843-1849Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (307) Google Scholar). Although it is not clear why sperm express one isoform of MCT in the head and another in the tail, it is postulated that MCT2 is coupled to LDH-X, the isoform of lactate dehydrogenase that is expressed exclusively in sperm tail (30Hintz M. Goldberg E. Dev. Biol. 1977; 57: 375-384Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar). Because the relative abundance of MCT2 transcripts varies from one tissue to another, MCT2 is presumably posttranscriptionally regulated, and the roles of each of the transcripts may be tissue-specific. Although the genomic clone for MCT2 is not yet available, our Southern blot analysis yielded a simple hybridization pattern, suggesting that MCT2 is a single copy gene in the human genome. The multiple transcripts of MCT2 may arise from alternative splicing or are generated by different promoters and/or have different polyadenylation sites. We studied the uptake of pyruvate in oocytes expressing human MCT1 and MCT2 because it is difficult to interpret data on MCTs expressed in mammalian cell lines because of the presence of high endogenous monocarboxylate transport activity. X. laevis oocytes, proved to be a reliable system for investigating the transport properties of MCTs using radiolabeled substrates (31Broer S. Rahman B. Pellegri G. Pellerin L. Martin J.L. Verleysdonk S. Hamprecht B. Magistretti P.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 30096-30102Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (292) Google Scholar). A preliminary analysis of human MCT1 and MCT2 substrate selectivity demonstrated that the two MCTs had similar but distinguishable substrate preferences. The major difference observed between human MCT2 and MCT1 was an almost 2-orders of magnitude difference in the K m value for the transport of pyruvate. The high affinity for pyruvate transport of the human MCT2 points to this isoform as the primary transporter of pyruvate in man. Hamster MCT2 only has a slightly higher, less than 4-fold, affinity for pyruvate as compared with hamster MCT1. The differential kinetic properties of MCT1 and MCT2 among the two species may relate to the fact that the amino acid sequence identity is only 49% between human MCT1 and MCT2 as compared with the 60% identity between hamster MCTs. Recombinant chimeric transporter studies will be helpful to identify regions within the MCT1 and MCT2 transporters that dictate their unique patterns of substrate specificity.dl-β-Hydroxybutyrate anddl-α-hydroxybutyrate were found to be inhibitors of pyruvate transport in MCT1- or MCT2-expressing oocytes. Furthermore, pyruvate transport was strongly inhibited by α-cyanocinnamates. Our studies show that α-cyano-3-OH-cinnamate exerted a more potent inhibitory effect than did α-cyano-4-OH-cinnamate in MCT1-expressing oocytes, whereas α-cyano-4-OH-cinnamate was found to block more transport activity mediated by MCT2. When decreasing the extracellular pH from 8.5 to 6.0, the uptake of pyruvate by MCT1 or MCT2 was stimulated, suggesting both MCTs function as H+/monocarboxylate cotransporters. Our data indicate that the two human MCTs are likely to have distinct biological roles. The physiological significance of the presence of both MCTs in the same tissue is unknown. Previously, Bröer et al. (31Broer S. Rahman B. Pellegri G. Pellerin L. Martin J.L. Verleysdonk S. Hamprecht B. Magistretti P.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 30096-30102Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (292) Google Scholar) proposed a mechanism of lactate shuttle between neurons and astroglial cells based on the molecular evidence of the existence of MCT1 mRNA in astroglia-rich culture and the expression of MCT2 mRNA in neuron-rich primary culture (31Broer S. Rahman B. Pellegri G. Pellerin L. Martin J.L. Verleysdonk S. Hamprecht B. Magistretti P.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 30096-30102Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (292) Google Scholar). Direct evidence of a transfer of lactate between Müller glial cells and photoreceptors in mammalian retina has also been provided (32Poitry-Yamate C.L. Poitry S. Tsacopoulos M. J. Neurosci. 1995; 15: 5179-5191Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Using in situhybridization, Pellerin et al. (29Pellerin L. Pellegri G. Martin J.-L. Magistretti P.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci., U. S. A. 1998; 95: 3990-3995Crossref PubMed Scopus (246) Google Scholar) provided an extensive characterization of the regional distribution of both MCT1 and MCT2 mRNA during development in the mouse brain. Their results showed that both transporter mRNAs are highly expressed in the cortex, the hippocampus, and the cerebellum. A peak in the expression of both transporters was observed at about postnatal day 15 and declined rapidly by 30 days, suggesting a mechanism of developmental regulation. We found wide distribution of both MCT1 and MCT2 in human tumor cell lines. Both transporters were expressed in the neoplastic hematopoietic lines, and the smaller 3.6-kb MCT2 transcript was favored. Our findings suggest that human MCT2 functions primarily as a pyruvate carrier. Further, human MCT2 may play a special role in the metabolism of cancer cells, perhaps facilitating anaerobic glycolysis. We thank Ge Dai for microinjection of Xenopus oocytes and Dr. P. H.

Apoptosis is a highly regulated active process of cell death that plays a crucial role in development and tissue homeostasis, but its deregulation is associated with the pathogenesis of a number of diseases including autoimmune disease, neurodegenerative disorders, and cancers (1Thompson C.B.

Cells undergoing apoptosis show characteristic morphological changes, including membrane blebbing, chromatin condensation, and DNA fragmentation. Although the mechanisms that control the process of apoptosis are still poorly understood, an increasing number of regulatory molecules involved in apoptosis have been currently identified and characterized. They include caspase family of cysteine proteases, the Bcl-2 family members, as well as tumor suppressor and oncogenic proteins such as p53, c-Myc, c-Jun, and RB (4Nagata S.

The evidence that protein kinases may participate in regulation of apoptosis is also now accumulating (13Anderson P. Microbiol. Mol. Biol. Rev. 1997; 61: 33-46Crossref PubMed Scopus (165) Google Scholar). One serine/threonine kinase, termed ZIP kinase, was recently cloned by our laboratory through the yeast two-hybrid system in which the leucine zipper domain of ATF4, a member of activating transcription factor/cAMP-responsive element binding protein (ATF/CREB) family of transcriptional factors, was used as a bait (14Kawai T. Matsumoto M. Takeda K. Sanjo H. Akira S. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 1642-1651Crossref PubMed Scopus (202) Google Scholar). In addition to an N-terminal serine/threonine kinase domain, ZIP kinase contains a C-terminal leucine zipper domain which is sufficient not only for the homodimerization and kinase activation but also for binding to ATF4. Overexpression of wild type ZIP kinase, but not kinase inactive mutant, caused the morphological changes typical of apoptosis in NIH 3T3 cells, suggesting that the kinase activity of ZIP kinase triggers apoptosis. Furthermore, the catalytic domain of ZIP kinase shares homology to that of DAP1 kinase. DAP kinase is also found to participate in apoptosis since its reduced expression by antisense mRNA protected HeLa cells from apoptosis induced by interferon-γ (15Deiss L.P. Feinstein E. Berissi H. Cohen O. Kimchi A. Genes Dev. 1995; 9: 15-30Crossref PubMed Scopus (538) Google Scholar). In addition, overexpression of DAP kinase induced apoptosis, and kinase-negative mutant blocked apoptosis by interferon-γ (16Cohen O. Feinstein E. Kimchi A. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 998-1008Crossref PubMed Scopus (380) Google Scholar). This study describes the cloning and characterization of two additional members of DAP kinase family, which we termed DRAK1 and DRAK2. Overexpression of DRAK1 and DRAK2 induced the morphological changes of apoptosis, as did DAP kinase and ZIP kinase. Therefore, we propose that these kinases form a new family of protein kinases that mediate apoptosis. A partial cDNA of the EST clone encoding DRAK1 was obtained by reverse transcriptase-PCR from a human placenta cDNA. To obtain full-length of DRAK1 cDNA, a human placenta λgt11 cDNA library (CLONTECH) was screened by hybridization through the standard procedures. DNA inserts of the purified phage clones were characterized by restriction enzyme mapping and nucleotide sequencing using an automated DNA sequencer (ABI model 377). Full-length of the DRAK2 cDNA was obtained by the rapid amplification of cDNA ends protocol from a human liver cDNA library according to the manufacturer's instructions (CLONTECH). Full-length cDNAs of human DRAK1 and DRAK2 were used to probe human Multiple Tissue Northern blots containing 2 μg of poly(A)+ RNA isolated from various tissues according to the manufacturer's instructions (CLONTECH). N-terminal FLAG- or Myc-tagged DRAK cDNAs were obtained by PCR. The PCR products were subcloned into pEF-BOS, a mammalian expression plasmid (17Mizushima S. Nagata S. Nucleic Acids Res. 1990; 18: 5322Crossref PubMed Scopus (1499) Google Scholar). The site-directed mutagenesis was performed using Transformer Site-directed Mutagenesis Kit (CLONTECH). Sequences of all constructs were confirmed by DNA sequencing. Sequences of the primer are available upon request. One million of COS-7 cells were transiently transfected with 10 μg of the plasmid by Lipofectin (Mirus Corp.). Cells were lysed with lysis buffer containing 0.5% Nonidet P-40, 150 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, and 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5. Cell lysates were immunoprecipitated with protein-G Sepharose (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) together with 10 μg/ml anti-FLAG M2 mAb (Eastman Kodak Co.). Immunoprecipitates were washed four times with lysis buffer and once with kinase reaction buffer (10 mm MgCl2, 3 mmMnCl2, 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.2). The in vitro kinase reaction was carried out in kinase reaction buffer containing 10 μCi of [γ-32P]ATP (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) for 10 min at 30 °C in the presence of 5 μg of myosin light chain (Sigma). Laemmli sample buffer was added to terminate the kinase reaction. After boiling, the samples were separated on SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and then visualized by autoradiography. COS-7 cells grown on glass plates were transiently transfected with 1.0 μg of the indicated plasmids by Lipofection. After 36 h, cells were doubly stained with anti-FLAG M2 mAb and DAPI (Wako) as described previously (14Kawai T. Matsumoto M. Takeda K. Sanjo H. Akira S. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 1642-1651Crossref PubMed Scopus (202) Google Scholar). NIH 3T3 cells were co-transfected with 9.0 μg of the indicated expression plasmid together with 1.0 μg of a β-galactosidase expression plasmid (pEF-BOS-lacZ) by Lipofectin. After 36 h, X-gal staining was performed as described previously (10Evan G.I. Wyllie A.H. Gilbert C.S. Littlewood T.D. Land H. Brooks M. Waters C.M. Penn L.Z. Hancock D.C.

To isolate genes that harbor the region homologous to the catalytic domains of DAP and ZIP kinases, we searched for DAP kinase-related EST clones using the BLAST and FASTA programs. The searches identified two novel genes that show a high degree homology with DAP kinase. Full-length cDNAs were isolated from human placenta and liver cDNA libraries by a combination of hybridization and PCR techniques. We termed these molecules DAP kinase-related apoptosis-inducing proteinkinase (DRAK)1 and DRAK2. Nucleotide sequence analyses revealed that DRAK1 contains an open reading frame of 414 amino acids with a predicted molecular mass of 46.56 kDa, whereas DRAK2 contains an open reading frame that encodes 372 amino acids with a mass of 42.34 kDa (Fig. 1). The putative kinase domains of both DRAKs are located at the N terminus and contain all 11 subdomains conserved among all serine/threonine kinases (Figs. 1 and 2) (18Hanks S.K. Quinn A.M. Methods Enzymol. 1991; 200: 38-62Crossref PubMed Scopus (1082) Google Scholar). Within the kinase domain, DRAK1 shows the highest homology to DRAK2 (67.1% identity). Besides the kinase domain, there is a homology in the non-catalytic C-terminal regions between DRAK1 and DRAK2 with 24.2% identity. These domains, however, do not reveal any significant homology either to those of DAP and ZIP kinases or to any other proteins. Within the kinase domain, DRAKs also display homology to CaMK II, and MLC kinase, in addition to DAP and ZIP kinases (Fig. 2).Figure 2Comparison of the kinase domains of human DRAK1, DRAK2, DAP kinase, ZIP kinase, CaMK II, and MLC kinase. The 11 subdomains conserved within serine/threonine kinases are indicated above the sequences.

In the case of DRAK1 expression, a major 1.9-kilobase pair transcript was detected in all tissues tested, with the highest expression in placenta. In addition, three minor transcripts of 7.0, 4.0, and 2.9 kilobase pairs were detected in placenta and also in other tissues after long exposure. In the case of DRAK2 expression, three transcripts of 5.1, 4.0, and 2.0 kilobase pairs were detected in various tissues, suggesting the existence of isoforms generated by alternative splicing or of highly homologous transcripts encoding different proteins. To clarify this point, we screened a human placenta λgt11 cDNA library with the DRAK2 cDNA as a probe. Sequencing analysis revealed that sequences of several clones obtained were completely identical within the coding region, although there were variations in the 3′-untranslated regions (data not shown). This suggests that all DRAK2 transcripts encode the same protein despite the existence of multiple transcripts probably due to differences in the 3′-untranslated region. To assess the biochemical functions of DRAKs, we performed an in vitro kinase assay. We prepared expression plasmids for N-terminal FLAG-tagged DRAKs and for mutant DRAKs with a point mutation in which a conserved lysine residue within the subdomain II was changed to alanine (termed FLAG-DRAK1 K90A and FLAG-DRAK2 K62A). The substitution of this lysine residue blocks the phosphotransfer reaction in a number of protein kinases and results in the loss of kinase activity. The cell lysates prepared from COS-7 cells transiently transfected with the indicated plasmid were immunoprecipitated with anti-FLAG mAb and were carried out in in vitro kinase reactions (Fig. 4 A). A 32P-labeled band at the size of 55 kDa was detected in cells transfected with wild type DRAK1. In contrast, the phosphorylation was abolished by the point mutation of the conserved lysine residue. Likewise, wild type DRAK2, but not DRAK2 K62A mutant, was autophosphorylated, although the kinase activity of DRAK2 was much lower than that of DRAK1. It was reported that the catalytic domain of DAP kinase shares homology with myosin light chain (MLC) kinase. Indeed, DAP kinase phosphorylated the MLC as an exogenous substrate. Therefore, we tested the ability of both DRAKs to phosphorylate MLC as the substrate. As seen in Fig. 3, both DRAKs, but not kinase inactive mutants, phosphorylated the MLC in vitro. To investigate the role of the C-terminal regions of DRAKs, we prepared a series of deletion mutants lacking the C-terminal region (Fig. 4 B). The plasmid was transiently transfected into COS-7 cells and subjected to the in vitro kinase assay. As shown in Fig. 4 C, both auto- and MLC phosphorylations were detected in cells transfected with the deletion mutant encoding DRAK1 amino acids 1–345 (Myc-DRAK1-(1–345)), with the same level of wild type DRAK1. By contrast, the kinase activity was drastically decreased in cells expressing the mutant encoding only the kinase domain of DRAK1 (Myc-DRAK1-(1–321)), suggesting the critical role of the C terminus for full activation of the kinase. Unlike DRAK1, the kinase activity of the mutant DRAK2 that lacked the C terminus (Myc-DRAK2-(1–293)) was higher than in cells introduced full-length DRAK2 or C-terminal deleted mutant (amino acids 1–315) of DRAK2. However, we found that the kinase activity of the mutants encoding only the kinase domain is roughly equal between DRAK1 and DRAK2 (data not shown). These results suggest the opposing function of the C terminus of both DRAKs in modulation of the kinase activity despite their similar structures. It was demonstrated that the cellular localization is different between DAP and ZIP kinases. DAP kinase is tightly associated with the cytoskeleton, whereas ZIP kinase is localized to the nucleus. Therefore, we investigated the cellular localizations of both DRAKs. The expression plasmid for either FLAG-tagged DRAKs WT or the kinase negative mutants (DRAK1 K90A, DRAK2 K62A) was transiently transfected into COS-7 cells. After 36 h, the FLAG proteins were detected by indirect immunostaining with anti-FLAG mAb and fluorescein-conjugated secondary antibody. The nuclei were simultaneously visualized by staining with DAPI. As shown in Fig. 5, the fluorescent signals for DRAKs and the nucleus overlapped, indicating that both DRAKs are exclusively localized to the nucleus, and the kinase activity was not required for the nuclear localization. However, we found that DRAKs were localized to both cytoplasm and nucleus in some transfected cells. DAP kinase is involved in the apoptotic process initiated by the interferon-γ receptor signaling (15Deiss L.P. Feinstein E. Berissi H. Cohen O. Kimchi A. Genes Dev. 1995; 9: 15-30Crossref PubMed Scopus (538) Google Scholar, 16Cohen O. Feinstein E. Kimchi A. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 998-1008Crossref PubMed Scopus (380) Google Scholar). ZIP kinase also induces apoptosis of NIH 3T3 cells when it is overexpressed (14Kawai T. Matsumoto M. Takeda K. Sanjo H. Akira S. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 1642-1651Crossref PubMed Scopus (202) Google Scholar). Therefore, we tested the ability of DRAKs to induce apoptosis. NIH 3T3 mouse fibroblast cells were transiently co-transfected with the expression plasmid for either DRAK1 or DRAK2 together with the LacZ expression plasmid as an indicator. Transfected cells were visualized by staining with X-gal solution. As seen in Fig. 6, blue-stained cells transfected with wild type DRAK1 or DRAK2 display the morphological changes of typical apoptosis characterized by shrunken cell size and membrane blebbing (DRAK1, 25.6%; DRAK2, 23.4%). In contrast, these features are not observed in the transfectants with catalytically negative mutants of DRAKs (DRAK1 K90A, 1.1%; DRAK2 K62A, 2.0%). In addition, the phenotypes of these mutant transfectants were almost the same with mock transfectants used as a control (data not shown). To investigate that there is some correlation between the kinase activity and initiation of apoptosis, we carried out the colony formation assay with the expression plasmid for DRAKs or their mutants. Each construct (Myc-DRAK1 WT, Myc-DRAK1-(1–321), FLAG-DRAK1 K90A, Myc-DRAK2 WT, Myc-DRAK2-(1–293), FLAG-DRAK2 K62A, or empty vector) was co-transfected along with neomycin resistance gene (pSV2 neo) into NIH 3T3 cells. Three weeks after transfection, G418-resistant colonies were scored by staining with 0.1% crystal violet solution. As seen in Table I, the colony numbers of both DRAKs WT were significantly reduced when compared with the vector transfected. In contrast, the colony numbers of the kinase negative mutants of both DRAKs were almost same with the vector transfected. In the case of the deletion mutants encoding only the kinase domains of both DRAKs (DRAK1-(1–321) and DRAK2-(1–293)), the number of colonies was increased when compared with the wild type of DRAKs. These results suggest that cell death-inducing activity of DRAKs was dependent on their intact structures but not their intensities of the kinase activity, and the C-terminal domain of DRAKs was necessary for induction of apoptosis. Furthermore, the cell death-inducing activity was similar for both DRAKs because of almost the same colony number between DRAK1 WT and DRAK2 WT transfections.Table IColony growth after transfection with the DRAKs or their mutant constructsExp. set1-aTransfections of each set were performed at the same time.pEF-BOS construct1-bpEF-BOS expression plasmids for DRAK1 and DRAK2 were constructed as described under “Experimental Procedures.”Colony yield1-cNIH 3T3 cells were co-transfected with 0.5 μg of pSV2neo plus 5 μg of the indicated construct of the plasmids by Lipofection.

However, the role for kinases in apoptosis is not clear. This study describes the cDNA cloning and characterization of two novel serine/threonine kinases designated DRAK1 and DRAK2. Both DRAKs are closely related throughout their overall structures. Furthermore, ectopic expression of DRAKs, but not kinase inactive DRAKs, triggered morphological changes typical of apoptosis of NIH 3T3 cells, suggesting the catalytic activities of both DRAKs to link the apoptotic process. The kinase domains of both DRAKs share homology to that of DAP kinase, which is involved in the apoptotic signaling induced by interferon-γ. Reduced expression of DAP kinase by antisense mRNA inhibits apoptosis by interferon-γ (15Deiss L.P. Feinstein E. Berissi H. Cohen O. Kimchi A. Genes Dev. 1995; 9: 15-30Crossref PubMed Scopus (538) Google Scholar). Overexpression of DAP kinase induced apoptosis, and the catalytically inactive mutant blocked apoptosis by interferon-γ (16Cohen O. Feinstein E. Kimchi A. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 998-1008Crossref PubMed Scopus (380) Google Scholar). Recently, we have identified ZIP kinase whose kinase domain is the most closely related to that of DAP kinase (14Kawai T. Matsumoto M. Takeda K. Sanjo H. Akira S. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 1642-1651Crossref PubMed Scopus (202) Google Scholar). Overexpression of ZIP kinase also induced apoptosis of NIH 3T3 cells as did DRAKs. Taken together, these kinases may form a new family of serine/threonine kinase that mediates apoptosis. Although kinase domains among DRAKs, DAP kinase, and ZIP kinase are closely related, the non-catalytic C-terminal regions are structurally different and do not share any homology. DAP kinase contains two known domains characterized by eight ankyrin repeats and the death domain, whereas ZIP kinase has the leucine zipper domain at its C-terminal end. These domains are known to mediate protein-protein interactions. In fact, ZIP kinase is activated when it homodimerizes through the leucine zipper domain. In case of DAP kinase, apoptosis was not induced in cells ectopically expressing the mutant that lacks the C-terminal region containing the ankyrin repeats and the death domain. This suggests that DAP kinase may be activated by formation of homodimer or binding to the regulatory molecule(s) through interactions with the domains. Similarly, the non-catalytic C-terminal regions of both DRAKs may also function as an interaction domain, although there is no significant homology to any other protein. The transfection studies with the DRAKs expression vectors indicated that the C-terminal domains play an important role for induction of apoptosis. Apoptosis was highly induced by expression of wild type DRAKs but not the kinase-inactive mutants or the deletion mutants lacking the C-terminal domains (Fig. 6and Table I). These findings suggested that the C-terminal domains of both DRAKs may function as an interacting domain with a regulator or a specific substrate for mediating apoptosis. Surprisingly, the induction of cell death was higher in cells expressing the wild type DRAK2 than DRAK2-(1–293), although the kinase activity of wild type DRAK2 was lower than DRAK2-(1–293). Therefore, there was no correlation between the intensity of the kinase activity and the induction of apoptosis. However, the kinase activity in addition to C-terminal domain was also required for the induction of apoptosis because the kinase-inactive DRAKs failed to induce apoptosis. We found that overexpression of both DRAKs did not cause the morphological changes of apoptosis in COS-7 cells (data not shown), which is different from the NIH 3T3 cells. In fact, the nucleus exhibited normal morphology when DRAKs were overexpressed into COS-7 cells (Fig. 5). It was considered that the genetic changes that protect cells from DRAKs-induced apoptosis occurred in the immortalization process of COS-7 cells or that the sensitivity to DRAKs-induced apoptosis was different depending on the cell type. Based on the sequence analysis, we found that there is a stretch of basic amino acids in the kinase subdomain II in DRAKs, ZIP kinase, and DAP kinase (Fig. 2). It is possible that the nuclear localization of DRAKs depends on the sequences, because the deletion mutant lacking the non-catalytic C-terminal region of ZIP kinase was exclusively localized to the nucleus (14Kawai T. Matsumoto M. Takeda K. Sanjo H. Akira S. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 1642-1651Crossref PubMed Scopus (202) Google Scholar). In addition, the mutant DAP kinase lacking the C terminus composed of ankyrin repeats and the death domain was localized to nucleus, although the intact form was tightly associated with the cytoskeleton (16Cohen O. Feinstein E. Kimchi A. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 998-1008Crossref PubMed Scopus (380) Google Scholar). It is possible that these kinases in some way function in the nucleus where they phosphorylate the downstream targets of the apoptotic machinery. However, upstream regulators or specific substrates for DAP kinase and ZIP kinase have not been identified. It is important to understand the regulation and function of DRAKs on apoptosis. Previously, several kinases besides DAP and ZIP kinases are reported to be activated in response to various apoptotic stimuli such as TNF-α, FasL, UV light, and certain drugs. JNKs, members of mitogen-activated protein kinase family, are reported to be activated by various apoptotic stimuli, whereas the blockage of JNKs pathway inhibited cells from apoptosis by such stimuli (19Verheij M. Bose R. Lin X.H. Yao B. Jarvis W.D. Grant S. Birrer M.J. Szabo E. Zon L.I. Kyriakis J.M. Haimovitz-Freidman A. Fuks Z. Kolesnick R.N.

Science. 1995; 270: 1326-1331Crossref PubMed Scopus (5045) Google Scholar). Furthermore, upstream kinases of JNKs, ASK1, and MEKK1 were also known to induce apoptosis upon overexpression (21Ichijo H.

Oncogene. 1997; 15: 2439-2447Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). Recently, it was reported that activation of CaMK II is an essential event in TNF-α- and UV light-induced apoptosis (24Wright S.C. Schellenberger U. Ji L. Wang H. Larrick J.W. FASEB J. 1997; 11: 843-849Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). CaMK II was rapidly activated in Ca2+-independent manner in response to TNF-α or UV light, and apoptosis was suppressed by CaMK II inhibitors. Considering that DRAKs are structurally related to CaMK II, DRAKs may be activated in response to various apoptotic stimuli as described above. Recent study has implicated that DAP kinase functions as a tumor suppressor gene (25Inbal B. Cohen O. Polak-Charcon S. Kopolovic J. Vadai E. Eisenbach L. Kimchi A.

The lung carcinoma clones, which behave as high metastatic cells, did not express DAP kinase, in contrast to cells behaving as low metastatic cells. When the expression of DAP kinase was restored into high metastatic carcinoma cells, the ability of lung metastasis was significantly suppressed after injection of cells into mice. Furthermore, the susceptibility to apoptosis in response to TNF was increased in the DAP kinase transfectants in vitro. We are currently investigating the expression of DRAK1 and DRAK2 in various tumor cells and their roles in tumorigenesis and metastasis. We thank K. Ohgishi and T. Aoki for excellent secretarial assistance."

Here, we established a primary culture system of smooth muscle cells maintaining a differentiated phenotype, as characterized by expression of smooth muscle-specific marker genes such as h-caldesmon and calponin, cell morphology, and ligand-induced contractility. Laminin retarded the progression of dedifferentiation of smooth muscle cells. Insulin-like growth factors (IGF-I and IGF-II) and insulin markedly prolonged the differentiated phenotype, with IGF-I being the more potent. In contrast, serum, epidermal growth factor, transforming growth factors, and platelet-derived growth factors potently induced dedifferentiation compared with angiotensin II, arginine-vasopressin, and basic fibroblast growth factor. Using the present culture system, we investigated signaling pathways regulating a phenotype of smooth muscle cells. In cultured cells, IGF-I specifically activated phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3-kinase) and its downstream target, protein kinase B, but not mitogen-activated protein kinases. Specific inhibitors of PI3-kinase (wortmannin and LY294002) induced dedifferentiation of smooth muscle cells even when they were cultured on laminin under IGF-I-stimulated conditions. The sole effect of laminin to retard the dedifferentiation was completely blocked by anti-IGF-I antibody, and laminin promoted the endogenous expression of IGF-I in cultured cells. The reduced promoter activity of the caldesmon gene induced by platelet-derived growth factor BB was overcome by the forced expression of the constitutive active form of PI3-kinase p110α catalytic subunit. These findings suggest that an IGF-I signaling pathway through PI3-kinase plays a critical role in maintaining a differentiated phenotype of smooth muscle cells.

The smooth muscle cells (SMCs)1 play roles in the control of blood pressure, enteric peristalsis, and bronchial, uterus, and bladder contraction. Although the precursor cells of SMC seem to undergo phenotypic modulation into matured cells, the origin of precursor cells has not been well characterized. During embryogenesis, three different lineages (cardiac neural crest, nodosa placode, and lateral mesoderm) have been, in part, proven as precursors of SMC. In the case of vasculogenesis (1Folkman J. D'Amore P.A. Cell. 1996; 87: 1153-1155Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1102) Google Scholar, 2Hanahan D. Science. 1997; 277: 48-50Crossref PubMed Scopus (1048) Google Scholar), angioblasts originated from mesoderm differentiate into endothelial cells, which then coalesce to form a single layer of endothelial tubes. It has been proposed that these primitive vessels are involved in the recruitment of neighboring mesenchymal cells and the subsequent differentiation of SMCs. However, the precise mechanism regarding recruitment of SMC precursors has remained unknown. Phenotypic modulation of SMCs is also associated with pathological conditions, such as atherosclerosis, hypertension, and leiomyogenic tumorigenicity. In the progression of these diseases, SMCs change their phenotype from a differentiated to a dedifferentiated state (3Ross R. Nature. 1993; 362: 801-809Crossref PubMed Scopus (10004) Google Scholar). Recent studies have focused on the molecular mechanism of SMC phenotype-dependent expression and/or isoform conversion of α-SM actin (4Campbell J.H. Kocher O. Skalli O. Gabbiani G. Campbell G.R.

These proteins, which are specifically expressed in SMCs, are collectively termed as SMC-specific molecular markers. The expressions of α-SM actin, caldesmon, calponin, SM22α, β-tropomyosin, smooth muscle myosin heavy chain, and α1 integrin are increased in differentiated SMCs but are decreased in dedifferentiated SMCs. These changes are regulated at transcription levels. Isoform changes of caldesmon, α-tropomyosin, and smooth muscle myosin heavy chain are controlled by alternative splicing in an SMC phenotype-dependent manner. Changes to these molecular markers are, therefore, favorable for quantification to SMC phenotypes (15Sobue K. Hayashi K. Nishida W. Horm. Res. 1998; 50 Suppl. 2: 15-24PubMed Google Scholar). In order to elucidate the molecular mechanism of such phenotypic modulation, it is necessary to use cultured SMCs. However, the SMCs in conventional culture display their phenotype from a differentiated to a dedifferentiated state (16Chamley-Campbell J. Campbell G.R. Ross R. Physiol. Rev. 1979; 59: 1-6Crossref PubMed Scopus (1266) Google Scholar). In addition, passaged SMCs do not show a differentiated phenotype even if they are cultured under quiescent conditions. Serum growth factors and extracellular matrices (ECMs) have been reported to be involved in such phenotypic modulation. Using morphological criteria, Hedin et al. (17Hedin U. Bottger B.A. Forsberg E. Johansson S. Thyberg J. J. Cell Biol. 1988; 107: 307-319Crossref PubMed Scopus (324) Google Scholar) demonstrated that in primary cultured vascular SMCs, laminin induced a delay in the progression of dedifferentiation, whereas fibronectin stimulated it. There are some reports regarding the establishment of cell lines that display partial characteristics of differentiated SMCs as monitored by morphological and biochemical indicators. Despite these efforts, primary culture systems or cell lines of SMC maintaining a differentiated phenotype have not been presented. Here, we achieved the first establishment of a primary culture system of SMCs to maintain a differentiated phenotype for a long culture using SMC-specific molecular markers, cell morphology, and ligand-induced contractility as indicators. We confirmed that laminin retarded the progression of SMC dedifferentiation and found that insulin-like growth factor-I (IGF-I) had a highly potent activity to maintain a differentiated phenotype. Using these culture conditions, we investigated the IGF-I-generated signaling pathway in SMCs and demonstrated the critical role of phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3-kinase) in maintaining a differentiated phenotype. This culture system seems to be useful for future analyses of SMC-specific signal transduction and transcription and for identification of factors affecting the SMC phenotype. Anti-PI3-kinase p85 subunit antiserum and monoclonal anti-IGF-I antibody, which can neutralize the activity of IGF-I, were purchased from Upstate Biotechnology. Polyclonal antibodies against mitogen-activated protein kinases (MAPKs), such as extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK), c-Jun N-terminal protein kinase (JNK), p38MAPK, Akt/protein kinase B (PKB), and PI3-kinase p110α subunit were obtained from Santa Cruz Biotechnology. Construction of caldesmon promoter plasmid, GP3CAT, is described elsewhere (12Yano H. Hayashi K. Momiyama T. Saga H. Haruna M. Sobue K. J. Biol.

Expression plasmid of a constitutive active form of PI3-kinase p110α subunit was kindly provided by Drs. H. Kurosu and T. Katada (Department of Physiological Chemistry, Graduate School of Pharmaceutical Sciences, University of Tokyo). This cDNA was constructed by Hu et al. as described previously (18Hu Q. Klippel A. Muslin A.J. Fantl W.J. Williams L.T. Science. 1995; 268: 100-102Crossref PubMed Scopus (517) Google Scholar) and was inserted downstream of the cytomegalovirus promoter of pCMV5. Gizzard SMCs in primary culture were prepared from 15-day old chick embryos. Whole gizzards were dissected under sterile conditions, and tunica muscularis was carefully separated from serosa and tunica mucosa. The gizzard muscles were minced well with scissors and were incubated at 30 °C in 1 mg/ml collagenase (type V, Sigma) solution containing 137 mm NaCl, 5 mmKCl, 4 mm NaHCO3, 2 mmMgCl2, 5.5 mmd-glucose, 10 mm PIPES, pH 6.5, and 0.2% bovine serum albumin (BSA) for 60 min with gentle shaking (19Small J.V. J. Cell Sci. 1977; 24: 327-349PubMed Google Scholar). Dispersed single cells were separated from undigested tissues by filtration and were collected by centrifugation at 800 rpm for 5 min at 4 °C. The cells thus obtained were washed twice with basal culture medium (Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (DMEM) supplemented with 0.2% BSA) and were cultured in the medium on 6-well culture plates (1 × 106cells/3.6-cm2 well) coated with ECM components (laminin, fibronectin, and collagen type I or collagen type IV) at 37 °C with 5% CO2 atmosphere. The coating of the wells with ECM components was performed as follows: the wells were soaked with solutions containing laminin or fibronectin (20 μg/ml in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS), Iwaki Glass, Chiba, Japan) or collagen type I or type VI (20 μg/ml in 0.1 mm HCl, Iwaki Glass) at room temperature for 3 h. After washing with PBS, the wells were soaked with DMEM containing 0.2% BSA to block nonspecific binding. The cultured cells were stimulated with indicated amounts of growth factors, cytokines, and/or kinase inhibitors on the first day of culture, and the medium was changed at an interval of 2 days. The medium containing wortmannin was replaced every 6 h throughout the culture period (20Ui M. Okada T. Hazeki K. Hazeki O. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1995; 20: 303-307Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (521) Google Scholar). Ligand-induced contractility of cultured SMCs was analyzed as follows. SMCs were cultured under IGF-I- or PDGF-BB-stimulated conditions for 3 days, and the cultures were washed with PBS and then stimulated with basal culture medium containing 1 mm carbachol for 1 min. Contraction was observed with a microscope, and the same fields of vision before and after carbachol treatment (1 min) were photographed. Total RNAs were extracted from precultured or cultured SMCs under indicated conditions using an ISOGEN RNA extraction kit (Nippon Gene, Japan). Two micrograms of total RNAs were separated on 1.0% agarose-formaldehyde denaturing gels and then transferred to nylon membranes. A caldesmon cDNA (GenBankTM accession number M28417) fragment (expanding from 286 to 810) and a calponin cDNA (GenBank accession numberM63559) fragment (expanding from 1 to 867) were used as probes to monitor the expression of respective mRNA. This caldesmon cDNA fragment, composed of parts of exon 2 and exon 3a is a common probe forh- and l-caldesmon (21Hayashi K. Fujio Y. Kato I. Sobue K. J. Biol.

In previous studies, we demonstrated using specific probes for h- orl-caldesmon that the full lengths of h- and l-caldesmon mRNAs are 4.8 and 4.1 kilobases, respectively (9Kashiwada K. Nishida W. Hayashi K. Ozawa K. Yamanaka Y. Saga H. Yamashita T. Tohyama M. Shimada S. Sato K. Sobue K. J. Biol.

Probes were 32P-labeled on the antisense strands and used for hybridization under the following conditions: at 42 °C for 16 h in 50% formamide, 6× SSC, 10× Denhardt's solution (1× Denhardt's solution is 0.02% polyvinylpyrrolidone/0.02% BSA), 0.5% SDS, and 0.5 mg/ml denatured herring sperm DNA. The blots were washed in 0.1× SSC containing 0.1% SDS at 52 °C and visualized by autoradiography. The ratio of h-caldesmon mRNA versus total h- and l-caldesmon mRNAs and the content of calponin mRNA were quantified by Scanning Imager (Molecular Dynamics). To quantify the applied RNAs, ribosomal RNAs were stained with 0.02% methylene blue. After washing with PBS, the indicated cultured SMCs were lysed with 2% SDS sample buffer. The protein samples were separated by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and transferred to nitrocellulose membranes. Detection of target proteins on the membrane was performed by ECL Western blotting detection kit (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) using the respective polyclonal antibodies against caldesmon (23Hayashi K. Yamada S. Kanda K. Kimizuka F. Kato I. Sobue K. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1989; 164: 503-511Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar) and calponin (24Takahashi K. Hiwada K. Kokubo T. Life Sci. 1987; 41: 291-296Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). The anti-calponin antibody was donated by Dr. K. Hiwada. Endogenous IGF-I mRNA in SMCs was analyzed by reverse transcription-PCR based on the contents of glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH) mRNA. Total RNAs were extracted from precultured and cultured SMCs under the indicated conditions, and oligo(dT)15 primed single-strand cDNAs were synthesized from 3 μg of total RNAs using RAV-2 reverse transcriptase (Takara). Heat-treated single-strand cDNA mixtures were subjected to PCR using specific sets of primers (see the legend to Fig. 6) and ExTaq DNA polymerase (Takara) under the following conditions: 96 °C for 3 min once and 28 cycles of 94 °C for 1 min, 62 °C for 1.5 min, and 72 °C for 1.5 min for IGF-I mRNA, and 96 °C for 3 min once and 18 cycles of 94 °C for 1 min, 56 °C for 2 min, and 72 °C for 2 min for GAPDH mRNA. We confirmed that PCR cycle numbers were pertinent because PCR products were saturated under 30 cycles for IGF-I mRNA and 20 cycles for GAPDH mRNA (data not shown). PCR products were separated on 1.2% agarose gels, and then transferred to nylon membranes. The membranes were hybridized with oligoprobes (see the legend to Fig. 6) to detect IGF-I and GAPDH cDNAs under the following conditions: at 45 °C for 16 h in 6× SSC, 10× Denhardt's solution, 0.5% SDS, and 0.5 mg/ml denatured herring sperm DNA. The blots were washed in 6× SSC containing 0.1% SDS at 50 °C. Quantification of amplified IGF-I and GAPDH cDNA were carried out as described for Northern blotting, and the ratios of IGF-I cDNA content were normalized to GAPDH cDNA contents. Phospholipid mixtures containing phosphatidylinositol (PI) and phosphatidylserine (PS) were dried under a stream of nitrogen and sonicated (2 mg/ml) in 10 mm HEPES (pH 7.4) in a bath sonicator at 0 °C for 15 min. Ten microliters of the vesicles (PI/PS) was used as a substrate for PI3-kinase. Preparation of cell lysates and immunoprecipitation for PI3 kinase were conducted at 4 °C. The cultured cells were washed three times with ice-cold PBS, and the cells were lysed in 550 μl of lysis buffer (20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 137 mm NaCl, 1 mm MgCl2, 1 mm CaCl2, 1% Nonidet P-40, 50 mm NaF, 1 mmNa3VO4, 50 μg/ml phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1 μg/ml leupeptin, and 1 μg/ml pepstatin). After 30 min of gentle shaking, the lysates were centrifuged in a microcentrifuge at 13,000 rpm for 5 min. The amounts of PI3-kinase p85 subunit in the cell lysates were estimated by Western blotting using antiserum against PI3-kinase p85 subunit (Upstate Biotechnology). The lysates containing equal amounts of PI3-kinase p85 subunit were precleaned with control rabbit IgG coupled protein A-Sepharose for 30 min. PI3-kinase was immunoprecipitated with antiserum against PI3-kinase p85 subunit (Upstate Biotechnology) and protein A-Sepharose. The immunoprecipitates were washed twice with the lysis buffer; twice with 100 mmTris-HCl, pH 7.5, 0.5 m LiCl, 1 mm DTT, and 0.2 mm Na3VO4; and three times with 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 100 mm NaCl, 1 mm DTT, and 0.2 mmNa3VO4. All washes were performed at 4 °C. The reaction mixtures (50 μl) containing the immunoprecipitates in 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 50 mm NaCl, 5 mm MgCl2, 0.5 mm EGTA, 10 μm ATP, 5 μCi [γ-32P]ATP, and 20 μg of PI/PS were incubated at 30 °C for 10 min. The reactions were terminated, and the lipids were extracted by the addition of CHCl3/MeOH (1: 2) and mixing. The mixture was vortexed and centrifuged. The extracted reaction products were separated by thin-layer chromatography by a developing solution composed of CHCl3/MeOH/4 m NH4OH (9:7:2). The production of phosphatidylinositol-3-phosphate was observed by autoradiography. Basic methods were similar to that for PI3-kinase assay. Cell lysis buffer comprised 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 120 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm EGTA, 1% Triton X-100, 50 mm NaF, 1 mm Na3VO4, 10 mm β-glycerophosphate, 50 μg/ml phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1 μg/ml leupeptin, and 1 μg/ml pepstatin for ERK and Akt/PKB; 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 10% glycerol, 1 mm DTT, 120 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm EGTA, 1% Triton X-100, 50 mm NaF, 1 mm Na3VO4, 10 mmβ-glycerophosphate, 50 μg/ml phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1 μg/ml leupeptin, and 1 μg/ml pepstatin for JNK; and 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 50 mm NaCl, 5 mm EDTA, 1% Triton X-100, 50 mm NaF, 2 mm Na3VO4, 10 mmβ-glycerophosphate, 50 μg/ml phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1 μg/ml leupeptin, and 1 μg/ml pepstatin for p38MAPK. The cell lysates were immunoprecipitated with specific antibodies against the respective protein kinases, and the immunoprecipitates were washed well with their lysis buffer and then with kinase assay buffer and incubated with respective specific substrates and 5 μCi [γ32P]ATP for 30 min at 30 °C. The reaction products were analyzed by 15% SDS-PAGE. Kinase reaction mixtures were as follows: 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 10 mm MgCl2, 1 μm protein kinase A inhibitor, 1 mm DTT, and 25 μg of histone H2B for Akt/PKB; 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 10 mm MgCl2, 1 μm protein kinase A inhibitor, 1 mm DTT, and 25 μg of myelin basic protein for ERK; 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 10 mmMgCl2, 1 μm protein kinase A inhibitor, 1 mm DTT, 1 mm Na3VO4, and 1 μg of glutathione S-transferase-Jun (1–79) for JNK; and 20 mm HEPES, pH 7.4, 20 mmMgCl2, 20 mm β-glycerophosphate, 1 μm protein kinase A inhibitor, 2 mm DTT, and 1 μg of glutathione S-transferase-ATF2 (1–96) for p38MAPK. Caldesmon promoter was analyzed using chloramphenicol acetyltransferase (CAT) construct, GP3CAT (12Yano H. Hayashi K. Momiyama T. Saga H. Haruna M. Sobue K. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 23661-23666Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar), according to the method described elsewhere (12Yano H. Hayashi K. Momiyama T. Saga H. Haruna M.

The SMCs prepared as described above were seeded on laminin-coated 6-well plates and were cultured in DMEM supplemented with 0.2% BSA or in the medium containing 20 ng/ml PDGF-BB for 3 days. Transfection was carried out on 3-day culture using Trans ITTM-LT1, polyamine transfection reagents (Pan Vera Corporation). Complex mixtures composed of 10 μg of trans-ITTM-LT1 reagent and 2 μg of GP3CAT, 1 μg of control plasmid carrying the luciferase gene under Rous sarcoma virus promoter (Rous sarcoma virus-luciferase), and 2 μg of control expression plasmid (pCMV5) or expression plasmid carrying a constitutive active form of PI3-kinase p110α subunit were added to the cells in Opti-MEM (Life Technologies, Inc.). Following a further 4-h incubation, the medium was replaced with DMEM supplemented with 0.2% BSA plus 2 ng/ml IGF-I or 20 ng/ml PDGF-BB, and the transfected cells were harvested 48 h later. Standardization of transfection efficiency was performed using luciferase activity as described previously (12Yano H. Hayashi K. Momiyama T. Saga H. Haruna M. Sobue K. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 23661-23666Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar, 14Obata H. Hayashi K. Nishida W. Momiyama T. Uchida A. Ochi T. Sobue K. J. Biol.

The transfection experiments were repeated at least three times on duplicate cultures with two or three different plasmid preparations. The CAT activity was quantified by Scanning Imager (Molecular Dynamics). Under conventional culture conditions, SMCs prepared by either enzyme dispersion or explant methods rapidly display phenotypic modulation from a differentiated to a dedifferentiated state (16Chamley-Campbell J. Campbell G.R. Ross R. Physiol. Rev. 1979; 59: 1-6Crossref PubMed Scopus (1266) Google Scholar). It has been suggested that ECMs play, at least in part, a role in the determination of SMC phenotype. Using SMC-specific molecular markers (caldesmon, calponin, α- and β-tropomyosins, and α1 integrin), we examined the culture conditions of SMCs using ECM components such as laminin, fibronectin, and collagens type I and type IV, which are present in the SMC layer. The expression of such SMC-specific molecular markers at mRNA levels represented a phenotype of SMCs; h-caldesmon and α-tropomyosin were converted to l-caldesmon and F1 and F2 tropomyosins, respectively. Calponin, β-tropomyosin, and α-integrin were also down-regulated during dedifferentiation (data not shown). Among them, we selected caldesmon and calponin as molecular markers for SMC phenotype (Fig. 1). In SMCs cultured on laminin, isoform conversion of caldesmon and down-regulation of total caldesmon (h- plusl-caldesmons) and calponin were significantly observed at 5 days of culture, and these changes proceeded thereafter. By contrast, such changes in the expression of marker genes occurred on the first day of SMCs cultured on the other three ECM components. These results indicated that laminin, but not other ECM components, retarded the dedifferentiation of SMCs. Although laminin retarded the dedifferentiation of SMCs, it was not able to maintain a differentiated phenotype for more than 5 days of culture (Fig. 1), suggesting the requirement of additional factors. We further examined the effects of several growth factors and cytokines on SMCs cultured on laminin (Fig. 2). Dedifferentiation of SMCs was induced by serum and several growth factors/cytokines such as platelet-derived growth factors (PDGFs), basic fibroblast growth factor, angiotensin II, arginine-vasopressin, epidermal growth factor (EGF), and transforming growth factors (TGFβs). These factors induced the conversion of h-caldesmon to l-caldesmon and the decrease of the calponin expression. Among them, serum, EGF, TGFβs, and PDGFs potently induced dedifferentiation compared with angiotensin II, arginine-vasopressin, and basic fibroblast growth factor; the former factors completely induced the conversion of h-caldesmon tol-caldesmon and the down-regulation of the calponin expression to a negligible level at 5 days of culture (Fig. 2 A, lanes 2–4 and 8–13). EGF, TGFβs, and PDGFs significantly decreased the expression of caldesmon (Fig. 2 A, lanes 9–13), whereas the down-regulation of caldesmon by serum (Fig. 2 A, lane 8) was modest. On the other hand, IGF-I, IGF-II, and insulin prolonged the differentiated phenotype of SMCs for more than 9 days of culture, as determined by the expression of h-caldesmon and calponin mRNAs (Fig. 2 A, lanes 5–7, 14, and 15–17) and the proteins (Fig. 2 B, lanes 1–4). The same results were obtained using α- and β-tropomyosins and α1 integrin as other SMC-specific molecular markers (data not shown). To determine which is the most potent factor for maintaining a differentiated state of SMCs, we compared dose dependence among IGFs and insulin (Fig. 3). The concentrations of IGF-I, IGF-II, and insulin required for half-maximum levels of h-caldesmon expression (the ratio of h-caldesmon mRNA to total h- and l-caldesmon mRNAs is 50%) were 6.5 × 10−13, 2.7 × 10−12, and 2.2 × 10−11m, respectively (Fig. 3 A). In regard to calponin, the concentrations of IGF-I, IGF-II, and insulin required for half-maximum levels were 1.3 × 10−12, 2.7 × 10−12, and 1.7 × 10−10m, respectively (Fig. 3 B). These results suggest that IGF-I is 2–4 times and 34–130 times more potent than IGF-II and insulin, respectively. We also confirmed by immunoblotting that IGF-I receptor protein was expressed in SMCs and that its expression was not affected by stimulation of IGF-I, serum, or PDGF-BB (data not shown). In addition to these SMC-specific molecular markers, SMCs cultured on laminin under IGF-I-stimulated conditions appeared as a spindle-like shape and formed a typical meshwork. They also displayed a carbachol-induced contractility (Fig. 4,A and C). In contrast, SMCs cultured under PDGF-BB-stimulated conditions showed a fibroblast-like shape and were unable to contract (Fig. 4, B and D). Based on three criteria, such as biochemical markers, cell morphology, and ligand-induced contractility, we concluded that our culture system as presented here made it possible to maintain a differentiated phenotype of SMCs for a long culture. We then investigated the effect of laminin on cultured SMCs (Fig. 5). Anti-IGF-I monoclonal antibody, which can neutralize the activity of IGF-I, abolished the effect of laminin to retard the dedifferentiation of SMCs under nonstimulated conditions (Fig. 5, lanes 1–3) and the effect"
https://openalex.org/W2002393139,"Arg-gingipain (RGP) is an Arg-X-specific cysteine proteinase produced by the Gram-negative anaerobe Porphyromonas gingivalis and has been shown to be a potent virulence factor in progressive periodontal disease (Nakayama, K., Kadowaki, T., Okamoto, K., and Yamamoto, K. (1995) J. Biol. Chem. 270, 23619–23626). In this study, we provide evidence that RGP acts as a major processing enzyme for various cell surface and secretory proteins in P. gingivalis. Fimbrilin, a major component of fimbriae, remained in the precursor form in the RGP-null mutant. Prefimbrilin expressed in Escherichia coli was converted to the mature fimbrilinin vitro when incubated with purified RGP, but its conversion was suppressed by potent RGP inhibitors. The results were consistent with the electron microscopic observation indicating little or no fimbriation in the RGP-null mutant. The immunogenic 75-kDa cell surface protein was also shown to retain its proform in the RGP-null mutant. In addition, Lys-gingipain (KGP) was found to be abnormally processed in the RGP-null mutant. In contrast, both prefimbrilin and the 75-kDa protein precursor were processed to their respective mature forms in the KGP-null mutant, suggesting that KGP is not involved in the normal processing mechanisms of these proteins. These results suggest that RGP not only acts as a direct virulence factor but also makes a significant contribution as a major processing enzyme to the virulence of P. gingivalis. Arg-gingipain (RGP) is an Arg-X-specific cysteine proteinase produced by the Gram-negative anaerobe Porphyromonas gingivalis and has been shown to be a potent virulence factor in progressive periodontal disease (Nakayama, K., Kadowaki, T., Okamoto, K., and Yamamoto, K.

Arg-gingipain Lys-gingipain polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. Porphyromonas gingivalis has been frequently isolated from subgingival lesions of patients with progressive periodontal disease and is believed to be one of the major causative agents of the disease (1Slots J. Genco R.J. J. Dent. Res. 1984; 63: 412-421Crossref PubMed Scopus (655) Google Scholar). This bacterium is known to produce a novel class of cysteine proteinases, now termed Arg-gingipain (RGP)1 and Lys-gingipain (KGP) on the basis of the peptide cleavage specificity at arginine and lysine residues, respectively, which are responsible for the trypsin-like activity of P. gingivalis (2Potempa J. Pike R. Travis J. Infect. Immun. 1995; 63: 1176-1182Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Recent studies revealed that the proteolytic activities of both enzymes were closely associated with the virulence of the organism in terms of the proteolytic destruction of host connective-tissue proteins (3Kadowaki T.

Our recent studies have revealed that two separate RGP-encoding genes (rgpA and rgpB) (21Nakayama K. Kadowaki T. Okamoto K. Yamamoto K. J. Biol.

By analyses with the RGP-null (rgpA rgpBdouble) mutant and the KGP-null mutant, both RGP and KGP have been shown to act as major virulence factors of P. gingivalis in the progression of periodontal disease. The bacterial colonization on gingival tissues that precedes bacterial penetration and tissue destruction is critical in the pathogenic process of periodontal disease. A variety of cell surface structures, including fimbriae, hemagglutinins, and lipopolysaccharides, are thought to be important for colonization of P. gingivalis in the periodontal pockets (22Slots J.

Sojar H.T. Grossi S.G. Christersson L.A. Genco R.J. Infect. Immun. 1991; 59: 4363-4370Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 27Ogawa T. Shimauchi H. Kusumoto Y. Hamada S. Immunology. 1990; 69: 8-13PubMed Google Scholar, 28Yoshimura F. Takasawa T. Yoneyama M. Yamaguchi T. Shiokawa H. Suzuki T. J. Bacteriol. 1985; 163: 730-734Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Also, the 75-kDa protein is known as a major immunodominant surface protein and is considered to contribute to the host-bacterial interaction (29Yoshimura F. Watanabe K. Takasawa T. Kawanami M. Kato H. Infect. Immun. 1989; 57: 3646-3652Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Molecular cloning and sequencing of their genes and the amino (NH2)-terminal amino acid sequencing of the purified proteins have revealed that maturation of these proteins requires specific cleavages of the Arg46-Ala47 bond in prefimbrilin (30Lee J-Y. Sojar H.T. Bedi G.S. Genco R.J. Infect. Immun. 1991; 59: 383-389Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 31Dickinson D.P. Kubiniec M.A. Yoshimura F. Genco R.J. J. Bacteriol. 1988; 170: 1658-1665Crossref PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar) and the Arg49-Ala50 bond in the 75-kDa protein precursor (32Watanabe K. Takasawa T. Yoshimura F. Ozeki M. Kawanami M. Kato H. FEMS Microbiol. Lett. 1992; 92: 47-56Crossref Google Scholar, 33Ogawa T. Mori H. Yasuda K. Hasegawa M. FEMS Microbiol. Lett. 1994; 120: 23-30Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). It is generally accepted that most of the cell surface proteins are initially synthesized as high molecular mass precursors and are subsequently processed to the mature forms during or after translocation. However, the precise mechanisms of the biosynthesis and processing of fimbrilin and the 75-kDa protein have not yet been studied. In particular, it is not known what enzyme(s) is responsible for processing of these proteins and where the processing occurs in the cells. In our previous studies, we have found that the RGP-null mutant has very few fimbriae on the cell surface (34Nakayama K. Yoshimura F. Kadowaki T. Yamamoto K. J. Bacteriol. 1996; 178: 2818-2824Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and that the Lys-X-specific cysteine proteinase activity was markedly decreased in this mutant (18Okamoto K. Kadowaki T. Nakayama K. Yamamoto K. J. Biochem. (Tokyo). 1996; 120: 398-406Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar), suggesting the defect of normal processing of the cell surface proteins and the KGP precursor in the RGP-null mutant. In this study, we provide the first evidence that RGP is a major processing enzyme for the maturation and translocation of the precursors of fimbrilin, the 75-kDa cell surface protein, KGP, and RGP itself in P. gingivalis. P. gingivalis ATCC33277, KDP112 (rgpA::Tcr rgpB::Emr) (21Nakayama K. Kadowaki T. Okamoto K. Yamamoto K. J. Biol.

Bacterial strains were maintained on blood agar plates and grown in enriched brain heart infusion broth (21Nakayama K. Kadowaki T. Okamoto K. Yamamoto K. J. Biol.

Erythromycin (10 μg/ml) and tetracycline (1 μg/ml) were added to the media, if necessary. Escherichia coli harboring thefimA-overexpressing plasmid pT7-5Bg71 (36Onoe T. Hoover C.I. Nakayama K. Ikeda T. Nakamura H. Yoshimura F. Microb. Pathog. 1995; 19: 351-364Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar) was maintained on L agar and grown in L broth supplemented with ampicillin (50 μg/ml) and kanamycin (20 μg/ml). Overnight cultures of P. gingivalis strains were harvested by centrifugation at 10,000 × g for 10 min at 4 °C. The bacterial cells were washed twice with 10 mm Tris-HCl buffer (pH 7.3) containing 30 mm NaCl at 4 °C. Bacterial cells were suspended in 33 mm Tris-HCl buffer (pH 7.3) followed by addition of the same volume of 40% sucrose in 33 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.3) at room temperature. Then EDTA was added to the cell suspension quickly to give the final concentration of 0.1 mm, and stirred gently for 10 min. By centrifugation at 12,000 × g for 15 min the cells were collected and subjected to osmotic shock by suspension in 0.5 mm MgCl2. The periplasmic fractions were sorted out from the osmolyzed cells by centrifugation at 13,000 ×g for 10 min. The osmolyzed cells were washed, sonicated, and separated into the cytoplasmic and membrane fractions by ultracentrifugation at 150,000 × g for 30 min. Sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (PAGE) was performed according to the methods of Laemmli (37Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (207018) Google Scholar). The solubilizing buffer containing the protease inhibitors (leupeptin and N α-p-tosyl-l-lysine chloromethyl ketone) at 0.1 mm was used. SDS-PAGE was performed under reducing conditions in 7–12% gradient gels after heat treatment of the samples in the solubilizing buffer at 100 °C for 5 min. Gels were stained with Coomassie Brilliant Blue R-250. For immunoblotting, the proteins on gels were electrophoretically transferred to nitrocellulose membranes and then immunostained with anti-fimbrilin antibody (38Yoshimura F. Takahashi Y. Hibi E. Takasawa T. Kato H. Dickinson D.P. Infect. Immun. 1993; 61: 5181-5189Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), antiserum to the 75-kDa protein (29Yoshimura F. Watanabe K. Takasawa T. Kawanami M. Kato H. Infect. Immun. 1989; 57: 3646-3652Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), or antibodies reacting with both RGP and KGP (39Abe N. Kadowaki T. Okamoto K. Nakayama K. Ohishi M. Yamamoto K. J. Biochem. (Tokyo). 1998; 123: 305-312Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar), essentially according to the procedure described previously (40Yamamoto K. Takeda M. Yamamoto H. Tatsumi M. Kato Y. J. Biochem. (Tokyo). 1985; 97: 821-830Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). The membrane fraction (200 μg of protein) of E. coli harboring the fimA-overexpressing plasmid pT7-5Bg71 was incubated with RGP (0.5 μg) at 37 °C for 3 h. The proteinase inhibitors (leupeptin and EDTA) were added to the reaction mixture at 0.5 and 10 mm, respectively. Samples were analyzed by SDS-PAGE in a 7–12% polyacrylamide gel. The proteins which had been separated by SDS-PAGE under reducing conditions were electrophoretically transferred from the gels onto polyvinylidene difluoride membranes. The protein bands on the membranes were stained with Coomassie Brilliant Blue R-250, excised, and subjected to the NH2-terminal amino acid sequence analysis by an automatic protein/peptide sequencer (Applied Biosystems Model 476A) To investigate the role of RGP in the distribution and processing of bacterial cellular proteins, P. gingivalis strains, the wild-type strain (ATCC33277), the RGP-null (rgpA rgpB double) mutant (KDP112), the rgpB + revertant from KDP112 (KDP114), and the KGP-null mutant (KDM35) were subfractionated into the cytoplasmic, periplasmic, and membrane fractions and then subjected to SDS-PAGE (Fig. 1). A 43-kDa protein band which was mainly observed in the cytoplasmic fractions of the ATCC33277, KDP114, and KDM35 (indicated by asterisks) disappeared in the corresponding fraction of KDP112. Instead, a new protein band with an apparent molecular mass of 43.5 kDa was observed in the cytoplasmic fraction of KDP112. On the other hand, there were three distinct differences in the electrophoretic profiles of the membrane fractions between KDP112 and the other three strains. While a 75-kDa protein band was obviously detected in ATCC33277, KDP114, and KDM35, the 75-kDa protein band was significantly decreased and a large amount of the protein having an apparent molecular mass of 78-kDa appeared in KDP112 (indicated by closed diamonds). A 51-kDa protein band seen in ATCC33277 and KDP114 was decreased in KDP112 (indicated by open triangles). Instead, an additional 51.5-kDa band appeared in KDP112. Either 51- or 51.5-kDa protein was hardly detectable in KDM35 because of disruption of the kgpgene. The electrophoretic profile of the periplasmic fraction at this area was significantly different between ATCC33277 and KDP114. A 44-kDa protein band that was demonstrated clearly in ATCC33277 and KDM35 was very weakly found in KDP114 (indicated by closed circles) and was not found in KDP112. Since the 44-kDa form of RGP is encoded by the rgpA gene (21Nakayama K. Kadowaki T. Okamoto K. Yamamoto K. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 23619-23626Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (217) Google Scholar), it is most likely that the marked decrease in the 44-kDa protein band in the rgpB +revertant KDP114 is caused by disruption of the rgpA gene. Disappearance of the 44-kDa protein in KDP112 is due to disruption of both rgpA and rgpB genes. In view of the size, the 43-kDa protein observed in the cytoplasmic fractions of ATCC33277, KDP114, and KDM35 seemed to be fimbrilin, a major component of fimbriae. To determine whether the 43-kDa protein is fimbrilin, an immunoblot analysis with anti-fimbrilin antibody was performed (Fig. 2). The 43-kDa proteins found in the cytoplasmic and membrane fractions of ATCC33277, KDP114, and KDM35 clearly immunoreacted with this antibody, although the immunoreactivity for the cytoplasmic fraction was more intense than that for the membrane fraction. The mobility of the 43-kDa proteins was consistent with that of the purified mature fimbrilin. On the other hand, the cytoplasmic fraction of KDP112 showed a single immunoreactive band with an apparent molecular mass of 43.5 kDa moving slightly slower than those of ATCC33277, KDP114, and KDM35. It is noteworthy that, in addition to the 43.5-kDa protein, a 44.5-kDa protein immunostained with the anti-fimbrilin antibody was sometimes observed in the cytoplasmic fraction of KDP112 (data not shown). Importantly, the anti-fimbrilin-immunoreactive proteins were barely detectable in the membrane fraction of KDP112. These results suggest that the RGP-null mutant is deficient in the processing and transport of prefimbrilin. Electron microscopy revealed that, while the wild-type strain ATCC33277 and the KGP-deficient mutant KDM35 possessed a number of characteristic curly fimbriae on the cell surface, the RGP-null mutant KDP112 showed little or no fimbriation (Fig. 3), suggesting that RGP and not KGP is responsible for fimbriation of P. gingivalis. We found an abundance of fimbrilin in the cytoplasmic fractions of ATCC33277, KDP114, and KDM35. However, it is plausible that fimbrilin molecules were released in part from the membranes to the cytoplasmic fractions during subfractionation.Figure 3Electron microscopy of the fimbriae on the wild-type, RGP-null mutant, and KGP-null mutant of P. gingivalis.

Kubiniec M.A. Yoshimura F. Genco R.J. J. Bacteriol. 1988; 170: 1658-1665Crossref PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar) and the mature fimbrilin purified from P. gingivalis (28Yoshimura F. Takasawa T. Yoneyama M. Yamaguchi T. Shiokawa H. Suzuki T. J. Bacteriol. 1985; 163: 730-734Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) has revealed that the maturation of prefimbrilin requires the specific cleavage of the Arg46-Ala47 bond, the NH2-terminal amino acid sequences of both 43- and 43.5-kDa proteins were determined (Table I). The NH2-terminal amino acid sequences of 43-kDa proteins in the cytoplasmic fractions of ATCC33277, KDP114, and KDM35 were found to be AFGVGDDESKV—–, which was identical with that of mature fimbrilin starting with the Ala47 residue (30Lee J-Y. Sojar H.T. Bedi G.S. Genco R.J. Infect. Immun. 1991; 59: 383-389Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The NH2-terminal sequence of the 43.5-kDa protein in KDP112 was TSNSNRAFGVG—–, which corresponded to the amino acid sequence starting with the Thr41 residue of the predicted amino acid sequence of prefimbrilin (36Onoe T. Hoover C.I. Nakayama K. Ikeda T. Nakamura H. Yoshimura F. Microb. Pathog. 1995; 19: 351-364Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar), indicating that the protein in the RGP-null mutant is processed by cleavage of the Lys40-Thr41bond. However, this alternative processing may not result in translocation of fimbrilin to the cell surface, since the RGP-null mutant has very few fimbriae. In addition, the amount of immunoreactive proteins with anti-fimbrilin antibody in the RGP-null mutant KDP112, especially in its membrane fraction, was much less than those in the wild-type strain ATCC33277 and the KGP-null mutant KDM35, suggesting that the alternatively processed fimbrilin in KDP112 might be unstable.Table IAnalysis of amino-terminal amino acid sequence of P. gingivalis proteinsSizeSourceImmunoreacted withSequencekDa43.0ATCC33277FimbrilinAFGVGDDESKV43.5KDP112FimbrilinTSNSNRAFGVG43.0KDP114FimbrilinAFGVGDDESKV43.0KDM35FimbrilinAFGVGDDESKV75.0ATCC3327775-kDa proteinAGDGNDNANPD78.0KDP11275-kDa proteinEGNGPDPDNAA75.0KDP11475-kDa proteinAGDGNDNANPD75.0KDM3575-kDa proteinAGDGNDNANPD51.0ATCC33277KGPDVYTDHGDLYN51.5KDP112KGPFNRDVYTDHGD51.0KDP114KGPDVYTDHGDLYN44.0ATCC33277RGPYTPVEEKQNGR48.0KDM35RGPYTPVEEKQNGR Open table in a new tab To determine whether RGP directly converts fimbrilin from its precursor form into the mature form, the membrane fraction of the prefimbrilin overexpressing E. coli was incubated at 37 °C for 3 h with the purified RGP in the presence or absence of the RGP inhibitors leupeptin and EDTA (Fig. 4). Following treatment with RGP, the 45-kDa prefimbrilin specifically disappeared and a 43-kDa protein appeared. Production of the 43-kDa protein was inhibited by the presence of the proteinase inhibitors. The interaction between the organism and the host cells is thought to be the first step of bacterial colonization and penetration into the host tissues. Since the fimbriae of P. gingivalis are believed to be one of the key factors for this interaction, it is most likely that RGP contributes to the bacterial adhesion to the host tissues through the processing of fimbrilin. P. gingivalis is known to produce a highly immunogenic 75-kDa protein on the cell surface, which forms large complexes with approximate molecular mass of 2,000 kDa (29Yoshimura F. Watanabe K. Takasawa T. Kawanami M. Kato H. Infect. Immun. 1989; 57: 3646-3652Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Western blot analysis with antiserum to the 75-kDa cell surface protein revealed that ATCC33277, KDP114, and KDM35 produced a 75-kDa protein predominantly in their membrane fractions, while the KDP112 membrane fraction showed a 78-kDa protein and a faint 75-kDa protein (Fig. 5). The NH2-terminal amino acid sequences of the 75-kDa proteins in ATCC33277, KDP114, and KDM35 were found to be AGDGNDNANPD—–. This sequence was consistent with that of the mature 75-kDa cell surface protein which was found to start with the Ala50 residue of the amino acid sequence predicted from the nucleotide sequence (Table I). The NH2-terminal sequence of 78-kDa protein in RGP-null mutant was EGNGPDPDNAA—. This sequence corresponds to the Glu23 residue of the amino acid sequence of the 75-kDa cell surface protein predicted from its nucleotide sequence (33Ogawa T. Mori H. Yasuda K. Hasegawa M. FEMS Microbiol. Lett. 1994; 120: 23-30Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar), indicating that the 78-kDa protein is produced by cleavage of the Lys22-Glu23 bond. The NH2-terminal amino acid sequence of the 75-kDa protein in the membrane fraction of KDP112 could not be determined because of its small quantity and contamination by other protein(s) with the same size. The results indicate that the 75-kDa cell surface protein precursor, like prefimbrilin, undergoes abnormal processing in the RGP-null mutant, suggesting that RGP makes a significant contribution to the virulence of P. gingivalis through processing of this cell surface protein. Considering the fact that the precursors of both fimbrilin and the 75-kDa protein are processed at the post-lysyl sites of their prodomains in the RGP-null mutant, the lysine-specific cysteine proteinase KGP may be involved as an alternative processing enzyme in post-translational cleavage of these membrane protein precursors in the RGP-null mutant. Since the precursors of fimbrilin and the 75-kDa protein in the KGP-null mutant KDM35, as well as the wild-type strain ATCC33277, were normally processed to their mature forms and since the cell surface morphology of KDM35 was quite similar to that of ATCC33277, KGP is not thought to be required for the normal processing of these proteins in the organism. As described previously (35Okamoto K. Nakayama K. Kadowaki T. Abe N. Ratnayake D.B. Yamamoto K. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 21225-21231Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar, 41Yamamoto K. Kadowaki T. Okamoto K. Abe N. Nakayama K. Katunuma N. Kido H. Fritz H. Travis J. Medical Aspects of Proteases and Protease Inhibitors. IOS Press, Amsterdam1997: 139-149Google Scholar), KGP, as well as RGP, is found in both cell-associated and secretory forms. The NH2-terminal amino acid sequence of the secretory 51-kDa KGP was identical with that of the cell-associated 51-kDa protein. The Arg-X-specific cysteine proteinase activity was not affected by disruption of kgp (35Okamoto K. Nakayama K. Kadowaki T. Abe N. Ratnayake D.B. Yamamoto K. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 21225-21231Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar), whereas the Lys-X-specific cysteine proteinase activity in both the cell extract and supernatant of fractions of RGP-null mutant (KDP112) was greatly decreased to 20–30% of the corresponding fractions of the wild-type parent strain (18Okamoto K. Kadowaki T. Nakayama K. Yamamoto K. J. Biochem. (Tokyo). 1996; 120: 398-406Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar). These observations suggest that RGP may be involved in processing of the KGP precursor. Immunoblot analysis with antibodies reacting with both RGP and KGP revealed that the cell extracts of KDP112 produced a discrete protein band with an apparent molecular mass of 51.5 kDa, while the wild-type strain ATCC33277 produced discrete protein bands with apparent molecular masses of 44 and 51 kDa, and smearing protein bands with molecular masses of 60–90 kDa (Fig. 6). In contrast, the cell extracts of KDM35 produced a discrete protein band with an apparent molecular mass of 48 kDa and smearing protein bands with molecular masses of 70–80 kDa. These results indicate that the 44- and 60–90-kDa protein bands (ATCC33277) and 48- and 70–80-kDa protein bands (KDM35) are derived from the rgp genes, whereas the 51-kDa (ATCC33277) and 51.5-kDa protein band (KDP112) originate from the kgp gene. The NH2-terminal amino acid sequence of the 51.5-kDa protein was found to be FNRDVYT- (Table I), which corresponds to the sequence starting with the Phe226residue of the amino acid sequence of prepro-KGP predicted from its nucleotide sequence (18Okamoto K. Kadowaki T. Nakayama K. Yamamoto K. J. Biochem. (Tokyo). 1996; 120: 398-406Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar). Since the NH2-terminal sequence of mature KGP in the wild-type strain is known to start with Asp229(18), KGP in KDP112 appears to have three additional residues at the amino terminus. The abnormal processing of KGP in the RGP-null mutant appeared to produce KGP with a reduced activity or to result in rapid degradation of the processed enzyme. Therefore, RGP seems to be important in the processing of pro-KGP. On the other hand, the NH2-terminal amino acid sequence of the 48-kDa protein in KDM35 was identical with that of the 44-kDa RGP in ATCC33277, which starts with the Tyr228 residue of the amino acid sequence of prepro-RGP predicted from its nucleotide sequence (13Okamoto K. Misumi Y. Kadowaki T. Yoneda M. Yamamoto K. Ikehara Y. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1995; 316: 917-925Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). The RGP purified from the culture supernatant of KDM35 also showed an apparent molecular mass of 48 kDa and had the same NH2-terminal sequence as that of the wild-type strain (not shown). Since the 44- and 48-kDa RGPs have the same NH2terminus, the difference in the molecular mass of these RGP proteins from ATCC33277 and KDM35 appears to be due to their COOH-terminal ends. It has been thought that both of the NH2 and COOH termini of the RGP proteinase domain are processed by Arg-specific proteinase (12Pavloff N. Potempa J. Pike R.N. Prochazka V. Kiefer M.C. Travis J.

Recently, we have suggested the importance of KGP in the processing of the 19-kDa hemoglobin receptor protein (35Okamoto K. Nakayama K. Kadowaki T. Abe N. Ratnayake D.B. Yamamoto K. J. Biol.

Kadowaki T. Yamamoto K. Fujimura S. Mol. Microbiol. 1998; 27: 51-61Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar). The NH2-terminal (Arg-Ala) and COOH-terminal (Lys-Pro) junction sequences of hemoglobin receptor protein have suggested that the cleavages at the NH2 and COOH termini of this protein are due to RGP and KGP, respectively. In fact, the NH2-terminal sequence of this protein in the RGP-null mutant (KDP112) was different from that in the wild-type strain (45Nakayama K. Ratnayake D.B. Tsukuba T. Kadowaki T. Yamamoto K. Fujimura S. Mol. Microbiol. 1998; 27: 51-61Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar). The KGP-null mutant (KDM35) growing on a blood agar for 3 days had no proteins immunoreacting with antiserum to the hemoglobin receptor protein, suggesting that KGP is responsible for the production of this protein (35Okamoto K. Nakayama K. Kadowaki T. Abe N. Ratnayake D.B. Yamamoto K. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 21225-21231Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar). Taken together, the present study suggests that KGP also plays important roles in the processing of some proteins in P. gingivalis. We thank Jeremy Hengst for critical reading of the manuscript."
https://openalex.org/W1984706102,"Differentiation of adipocytes is an important aspect of energy homeostasis. Although the transcriptional regulation of adipocyte differentiation is relatively well characterized, the subsequent molecular events remain unclear. The activity of phosphoinositide (PI) 3-kinase precipitated with antibodies to phosphotyrosine has now been shown to increase transiently during adipocyte differentiation of 3T3-F442A and of 3T3-L1 cells. PI 3-kinase activity precipitated with antibodies to insulin receptor substrate 1 (IRS1) and association of subunits of PI 3-kinase with IRS1 were also increased at this stage of differentiation, suggesting that IRS1 contributes to PI 3-kinase activation. Inhibition of the activation of PI 3-kinase by expression of dominant negative mutant subunits of the enzyme prevented adipogenesis, as assessed by lipid accumulation and expression of key adipocyte proteins such as GLUT4, adipsin, and aP2, suggesting that PI 3-kinase activation is essential for adipocyte differentiation. However, these mutant proteins did not affect either the expression of the transcription factor PPARγ at the mRNA or protein level or the increase in the abundance of mRNAs encoding the adipocyte marker proteins. These results demonstrate that adipocyte differentiation is regulated at the posttranscriptional level and that activation of PI 3-kinase is required for this regulation.

Inhibition of the activation of PI 3-kinase by expression of dominant negative mutant subunits of the enzyme prevented adipogenesis, as assessed by lipid accumulation and expression of key adipocyte proteins such as GLUT4, adipsin, and aP2, suggesting that PI 3-kinase activation is essential for adipocyte differentiation. However, these mutant proteins did not affect either the expression of the transcription factor PPARγ at the mRNA or protein level or the increase in the abundance of mRNAs encoding the adipocyte marker proteins. These results demonstrate that adipocyte differentiation is regulated at the posttranscriptional level and that activation of PI 3-kinase is required for this regulation. phosphoinositide insulin receptor substrate 5,8,11,14-eicosatetraynoic acid isobutylmethylxanthine β-galactosidase multiplicity of infection plaque-forming unit(s) insulin-like growth factor. Adipocytes are essential for regulation of energy homeostasis, not only by serving as a massive energy reserve but by secreting hormones and cytokines that affect food intake or metabolic regulation (1Spiegelman B.M.

Because mature adipocytes do not undergo cell division, the number of these cells is thought to increase as a result of differentiation of preadipocytes into mature adipocytes (1Spiegelman B.M.

Studies with cultured cell lines that can be induced to differentiate into adipocytes have shed light on the regulation, especially at the transcriptional level, of adipocyte differentiation (1Spiegelman B.M.

Trans-activation of adipocyte-specific genes is thought to be induced by a cascade of key transcriptional factors including PPARγ (4Tontonoz P Hu E. Graves R.A. Budavari A.I. Spiegelman B.M.

Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 4126-4136Google Scholar). Thus, these factors coordinate the expression of genes, such as those encoding insulin-sensitive glucose transporter GLUT4, the fatty acid-binding protein aP2, and adipsin, which contribute to the creation and maintenance of the adipocyte phenotype (13Smas C.M. Sul H.S. Biochem. J. 1995; 306: 697-710Crossref PubMed Scopus (225) Google Scholar). In addition to regulation at the transcriptional level, posttranscriptional mechanisms also may be important in determining the amounts of various proteins during adipocyte differentiation. For example, activation of PPARγ by a thiazolidinedione derivative has been shown to result in a decrease in the amount of PP2Ac protein without an affect on the abundance of its mRNA (14Altiok S. Min X. Spiegelman B.M. Genes Dev. 1997; 11: 1987-1998Crossref PubMed Scopus (337) Google Scholar), suggesting that PPARγ regulates not only transcriptional but also posttranscriptional mechanisms. However, the regulatory events that occur subsequent to sequential gene transcription during adipogenesis remain largely unknown. Phosphoinositide (PI)13-kinase, a lipid kinase composed of an Src homology 2 domain-containing regulatory subunit (p85) and a 110-kDa catalytic subunit (p110), catalyzes phosphorylation of the D3 position of phosphoinositides. This enzyme is important in a wide variety of cellular processes, including intracellular trafficking, organization of the cytoskeleton, cell growth and transformation, and prevention of apoptosis (15Toker A Cantley L.C.

We have now investigated the role of PI 3-kinase in adipocyte differentiation and, more specifically, at which level in the differentiation process it might act.

Bernlohr (University of Minnesota, St. Paul, MN), M. F. White (Joslin Diabetes Center, Boston, MA), and R. A. Roth (Stanford University, Stanford, CA), respectively. A monoclonal antibody to the insulin receptor (29B4) was obtained from Santa Cruz Biotechnology. Probes for Northern blot analysis were as described (9Tonztoz P. Hu E. Spiegelman B.M.

Troglitazone was kindly provided by Sankyo Pharmaceutical Co. (Tokyo, Japan). 3T3-F442A or 3T3-L1 preadipocytes were maintained under an atmosphere of 7.5% CO2 in Dulbecco's minimum essential medium containing 25 mm glucose and supplemented with 10% calf serum, 2 mml-glutamine, 500 ml penicillin, and 50 μg/ml streptomycin. Adipocyte differentiation was induced by treating confluent 3T3-F442A cells for 2 days with insulin (5 μg/ml) and ETYA (100 μm) in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 10% fetal calf serum, and then for 2 days with insulin (5 μg/ml) dissolved in the same medium. Alternatively, the cells were treated with troglitazone (30 μg/ml) in the same medium for only 2 days. Differentiation of 3T3-L1 preadipocytes was induced by exposing confluent cells to insulin (5 μg/ml), isobutylmethylxanthine (IBMX) (0.5 mm), and dexamethasone (0.25 μm) for 2 days, and then to insulin (5 μg/ml) alone for an additional 2 days. After incubation with these reagents, the basal medium was replenished every other day. Staining of cells with oil red O was performed as described (22Hu E. Kim J.B. Sarraf P. Spiegelman B.M. Science. 1996; 274: 2100-2103Crossref PubMed Scopus (941) Google Scholar). An adenovirus vector encoding Δp85, bovine p85α lacking the binding site for the catalytic subunit of PI 3-kinase, was as described previously (20Sakaue H. Ogawa W. Takata M. Kuroda S. Kotani K. Matsumoto M. Sakaue M. Nishio S. Ueno H. Kasuga M. Mol. Endocrinol. 1997; 11: 1552-1562Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar). Complementary DNA encoding p110N, a COOH-terminal deletion mutant of bovine p110α (amino acids 2–127) fused with the Myc epitope tag at its NH2 terminus, was cloned into pAxCAwt (24Kanegae Y. Lee G. Tanaka M. Nakai M. Sakai T. Sugano S. Saito I. Nucleic Acids Res. 1995; 23: 3621-3816Crossref PubMed Scopus (599) Google Scholar), and an adenovirus vector encoding p110N was isolated as described (20Sakaue H. Ogawa W. Takata M. Kuroda S. Kotani K. Matsumoto M. Sakaue M. Nishio S. Ueno H. Kasuga M. Mol. Endocrinol. 1997; 11: 1552-1562Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar). When overexpressed, p110N acts in a dominant negative manner by competing with endogenous p110 for the regulatory subunits of the enzyme2. An adenovirus vector containing the lacZ gene (AxCALacZ) (25Miyake S. Makimura M. Kanegae Y. Harada S. Sato Y. Takamori K. Tokuda C. Saito I. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 1320-1324Crossref PubMed Scopus (788) Google Scholar) was kindly provided by I. Saito (Tokyo University, Japan). For adenovirus-mediated gene transfer, cells cultured to subconfluence were infected with various adenovirus vectors at the indicated multiplicity of infection (m.o.i.). Two days after infection, differentiation was induced as described above. 3T3-F442A or 3T3-L1 preadipocytes were induced to differentiate as described above. At the indicated times, the cells were lysed as described (20Sakaue H. Ogawa W. Takata M. Kuroda S. Kotani K. Matsumoto M. Sakaue M. Nishio S. Ueno H. Kasuga M. Mol. Endocrinol. 1997; 11: 1552-1562Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar), and PI 3-kinase activity in immunoprecipitates prepared with antibodies to phosphotyrosine or to IRS1 was assayed as described (20Sakaue H. Ogawa W. Takata M. Kuroda S. Kotani K. Matsumoto M. Sakaue M. Nishio S. Ueno H. Kasuga M. Mol. Endocrinol. 1997; 11: 1552-1562Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar). For Northern blot analysis, cells were harvested at the indicated time and total RNA was extracted with the use of an RNeasy kit (Qiagen). Twenty micrograms of total RNA were then subjected to Northern analysis with various probes as described previously (9Tonztoz P. Hu E. Spiegelman B.M. Cell. 1994; 79: 1147-1156Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3133) Google Scholar, 22Hu E. Kim J.B. Sarraf P. Spiegelman B.M. Science. 1996; 274: 2100-2103Crossref PubMed Scopus (941) Google Scholar, 23Cook K.S. Min H.Y. Johnson D. Chaplinsky R.J. Flier J.S. Hunt C.R. Spiegelman B.M. Science. 1987; 237: 402-405Crossref PubMed Scopus (301) Google Scholar). Lysates containing ∼100 μg of protein were subjected to immunoblot analysis. Differentiation of 3T3-F442A preadipocytes was induced with insulin and the arachidonic acid analog ETYA, and, at various times, the cells were lysed and PI 3-kinase activity was assayed in immunoprecipitates prepared with antibodies to phosphotyrosine. PI 3-kinase activity was markedly increased 4 days after induction of differentiation, but it had returned to basal values by 8 days (Fig. 1 A). A similar activation of PI 3-kinase was observed when differentiation was induced by troglitazone (Fig. 1 A), a direct activator of PPARγ (26Lehman J.M. Moore L.B. Smith-Oliver T.A. Wilkison W.O. Willson T.M. Kliewer S.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 12953-12956Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3469) Google Scholar); however, the peak of PI 3-kinase activity was delayed by 2 days compared with that in cells treated with insulin and ETYA, consistent with the 2-day delay in lipid accumulation apparent in troglitazone-treated cells (data not shown). Furthermore, differentiation of 3T3-L1 preadipocytes induced by a combination of insulin, IBMX, and dexamethasone was accompanied by a transient activation of PI 3-kinase at a similar stage (Fig. 1 B). These data suggested that activation of PI 3-kinase is not a direct effect of the reagents used to induce differentiation, but is rather a characteristic event associated with adipocyte differentiation. We next investigated which tyrosine-phosphorylated protein associates with PI 3-kinase during adipocyte differentiation. Specific antibodies to the p85 regulatory subunit of PI 3-kinase precipitated an ∼180-kDa tyrosine-phosphorylated protein from 3T3-F442A cells induced to differentiate with insulin and ETYA or with troglitazone (Fig. 2 A). The time course of the association of this phosphorylated protein with p85 was similar to that of PI 3-kinase activation during differentiation. Four days after induction of differentiation with insulin and ETYA, a 180-kDa tyrosine-phosphorylated protein was also detected in immunoprecipitates prepared with antibodies to p110 catalytic subunit of PI 3-kinase; furthermore, immunoprecipitates prepared with antibodies to p85 reacted with antibodies to IRS1 (Fig. 2 B). Immunoprecipitates prepared with antibodies to IRS1 also reacted with antibodies to phosphotyrosine (Fig. 2 B). Moreover, PI 3-kinase activity in immunoprecipitates prepared with antibodies to IRS1 increased during adipocyte differentiation with a time course similar to that observed for PI 3-kinase activity in anti-phosphotyrosine immunoprecipitates (Figs. 1 A and 2 C). These data suggested that tyrosine phosphorylation of IRS1 contributes to the activation of PI 3-kinase during adipogenesis. Immunoprecipitates prepared with antibodies to IRS2, a protein closely related to IRS1, also reacted with antibodies to phosphotyrosine (Fig. 2 B); the corresponding tyrosine-phosphorylated protein migrated slightly more slowly than that precipitated with antibodies to IRS1 (Fig. 2 B), consistent with the slightly larger molecular size of IRS2 relative to that of IRS1 (27White M.F. Diabetologia. 1997; 40: 2-17Crossref PubMed Scopus (465) Google Scholar). Moreover, immunoprecipitates prepared with antibodies to p85 reacted with antibodies to IRS2, suggesting that IRS2 also undergoes tyrosine phosphorylation and associates with PI 3-kinase during adipocyte differentiation (Fig. 2 B). However, the mobilities of the tyrosine-phosphorylated proteins detected in the immunoprecipitates prepared with antibodies to p110 or to p85 were similar to that of the phosphoprotein precipitated with antibodies to IRS1; they were slightly greater than that of IRS2. It is thus likely that the major tyrosine-phosphorylated protein associated with PI 3-kinase is IRS1, although IRS2 is also phosphorylated and may, at least in part, contribute to the activation of PI 3-kinase during adipocyte differentiation. Because IRS proteins are well characterized substrates of the insulin receptor family of tyrosine kinases, we examined whether the insulin receptor or the IGF 1 receptor is activated during adipocyte differentiation. The amount of the insulin receptor protein was markedly increased during differentiation of 3T3-F442A cells induced with insulin and ETYA (Fig. 2 D), as consistent with a previous report (28Rice K.M. Lienhard G.E. Garner C.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 10163-10167Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). However, tyrosine phosphorylation of ∼100 kDa proteins, of which molecular size correspond to those of the insulin and IGF-1 receptors, was barely detectable in the immunoprecepitates prepared with antibodies to the insulin receptor (Fig. 2 D) or to the IGF1 receptor (data not shown). When the membrane was exposed to a film for a long time, faint tyrosine-phosphorylated bands were evident in the immunoprecipitates with antibodies to the insulin receptor at 2–4 days after the induction of differentiation with insulin and ETYA. However, the extent of tyrosine phosphorylation during adipogenesis was much smaller than that in differentiated 3T3-F442A cells that were treated with 100 nm insulin for 10 min (Fig. 2 D). At 4 days after induction, an ∼180-kDa and an ∼190-kDa tyrosine phosphorylated proteins, which are likely to be IRS1 and IRS2, were apparent in anti-phosphotyrosine immunoprecipitates (Fig. 2 E); the extent of tyrosine phosphorylation of these proteins was similar to those of a 180-kDa and a 190-kDa protein in differentiated 3T3-F442A cells that were treated with insulin. A 100-kDa protein, of which molecular size corresponds to those of the insulin and the IGF-1 receptors, also became tyrosine-phosphorylated at 4 days after induction; however, the extent of tyrosine phosphorylation of the 100-kDa protein was, again, much less than that of a 100-kDa protein in differentiated 3T3-F442A cells that were treated with insulin (Fig. 2 E). These results suggest that the insulin receptor or the IGF1 receptor was not significantly activated during adipocyte differentiation. To investigate whether the transient change in the activity of PI 3-kinase is important for adipocyte differentiation, we attempted to inhibit PI 3-kinase activation with the use of dominant negative mutants of the enzyme. Adenovirus vectors encoding either a mutant p85 that lacks the binding site for p110 (Δp85) (19Hara K. Yonezawa K. Sakaue H. Ando A. Kotani K. Kitamura T. Kitamura Y. Ueda H. Stephens L. Jackson T.R. Hawkins P.T. Dhand R. Clark A.E. Holman G.D. Waterfield M.D. Kasuga M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 7415-7419Crossref PubMed Scopus (418) Google Scholar, 20Sakaue H. Ogawa W. Takata M. Kuroda S. Kotani K. Matsumoto M. Sakaue M. Nishio S. Ueno H. Kasuga M. Mol. Endocrinol. 1997; 11: 1552-1562Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar) or a COOH-terminal deletion mutant of p110 that lacks the kinase domain but retains the binding site for p85 (p110N) were prepared. Infection of 3T3-F442A cells with adenovirus vectors encoding either of these mutants, but not with a virus encoding β-galactosidase (β-gal), almost completely inhibited the activation of PI 3-kinase normally apparent in anti-phosphotyrosine immunoprecipitates prepared from cells treated with insulin plus ETYA or with troglitazone (Fig. 3), confirming that these mutants exerted dominant inhibitory effects on PI 3-kinase activation in these cells. Infection of the cells with viruses encoding either Δp85 or p110N also inhibited lipid accumulation in an m.o.i.-dependent manner; at an m.o.i. of 30 plaque-forming units (pfu)/cell, lipid accumulation induced by insulin plus ETYA was completely abolished (Fig. 4, D–I), whereas a control virus encoding β-gal did not affect adipocyte differentiation induced by insulin and ETYA (Fig. 4, A–C). A similar m.o.i.-dependent inhibition of adipogenesis (as assessed by lipid accumulation) by these adenoviruses was observed in both 3T3-F442A cells induced to differentiate with troglitazone and in 3T3-L1 cells treated with insulin, IBMX, and dexamethasone (data not shown), indicating that PI 3-kinase activation is required for adipogenesis. We next examined the effects of the dominant negative mutants of PI 3-kinase on the expression of PPARγ, a key transcriptional regulator during adipocyte differentiation. Both PPARγ mRNA and protein were apparent within 2 days after induction of differentiation of 3T3-F442A cells with insulin plus ETYA, with the abundance of both being maximal at 4 days (Fig. 5). The increases in PPARγ mRNA and protein during adipocyte differentiation were not affected by infection of the cells with adenoviruses encoding either Δp85 or p110N even at an m.o.i. of 30 pfu/cell (Fig. 5), a virus concentration sufficient for complete inhibition of lipid accumulation (Fig. 4). Furthermore, the differentiation-associated increase in the abundance of mRNAs encoding various adipocyte marker proteins, including GLUT4, adipsin, and aP2, was not affected by either of the dominant negative mutants of PI 3-kinase (Fig. 6 A). Moreover, the time course of the increase in GLUT4 mRNA did not differ between cells infected with viruses encoding Δp85 or p110N and control cells (Fig. 6 B). These data suggested that PI 3-kinase activity is not required for the transcriptional control of genes that encode adipocyte-specific proteins.Figure 6Effects of dominant negative mutants of PI 3-kinase on the abundance of adipocyte-specific marker (GLUT4, adipsin, and aP2) mRNAs during differentiation of 3T3-F442A cells. A, cells were infected or not (control) with adenovirus vectors encoding β-gal, Δp85, or p110N at the indicated m.o.i. and subsequently induced (or not) to differentiate with insulin plus ETYA. Eight days after induction, mRNAs encoding GLUT4, adipsin, and aP2 were assayed by Northern blot analysis. B, cells were infected or not (control) with adenovirus vectors encoding Δp85 or p110N at an m.o.i. of 30 pfu/cell and subsequently induced to differentiate with insulin plus ETYA. At the indicated times, GLUT4 mRNA was assayed by Northern analysis. Data are representative of three experiments.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) We also investigated the effects of the dominant negative mutants of PI 3-kinase on the abundance of GLUT4, adipsin, and aP2 proteins during adipocyte differentiation. The amount of GLUT4 was markedly increased at 4 days and maximal at 6 days after the induction of differentiation of 3T3-F442A cells with insulin plus ETYA (Fig. 7 A). The increase in the amount of GLUT4, as well as similar increases in the amounts of adipsin and aP2 proteins, was markedly inhibited by either Δp85 or p110N in an m.o.i.-dependent manner (Fig. 7 B); at an m.o.i. (30 pfu/cell) sufficient to prevent lipid accumulation, these adipocyte marker proteins were undetectable by immunoblot analysis. These data suggested that activation of PI 3-kinase is required for expression of adipocyte-specific proteins at a posttranscriptional step. To determine whether activation of PI 3-kinase at a specific stage is important for adipocyte differentiation, we examined the effects of genistein, a broad spectrum pharmacological inhibitor of tyrosine kinases (29Akiyama T. Ishida J. Nakagawa S. Ogawara H. Watanabe S. Itoh N. Shibuya M. Fukami Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 5592-5595Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Addition of genistein to 3T3-F442A cells 3 days after the induction of differentiation with insulin plus ETYA resulted in marked inhibition of the tyrosine phosphorylation of IRS1, as well as of the activation of PI 3-kinase in anti-phosphotyrosine immunoprecipitates, normally apparent at 4 days (Fig. 8 A). Genistein added at this time also inhibited the differentiation-associated increase in the amount of GLUT4 protein, without affecting the increase in GLUT4 mRNA (Fig. 8 B). However, addition of genistein 6 days after induction of differentiation, at which time the activity of PI 3-kinase has already begun to decrease (Fig. 1 A), did not inhibit expression of GLUT4 protein (Fig. 8 B). Moreover, 8 days after induction of differentiation by insulin plus ETYA, at which time the activity of PI 3-kinase has already returned to basal values (Fig. 1 A), infection of cells with viruses encoding either Δp85 or p110N did not affect the amount of GLUT4 protein (data not shown). These data suggest that the transient increase in PI 3-kinase activity that occurs 4–6 days after induction of differentiation with insulin and ETYA is required for expression of adipocyte-specific proteins at a posttranscriptional level. We finally examined the effect of rapamycin on the expression of GLUT4 protein because this reagent partially inhibits mitogen-stimulated bulk protein synthesis at posttranscriptional level (30Jefferies H.B.J. Reinhard C. Kozma S.C. Thomas G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 4441-4445Crossref PubMed Scopus (560) Google Scholar, 31Mendez R. Myers Jr., M.G. White M.F. Rhoads R.E. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 2857-2864Crossref PubMed Scopus (208) Google Scholar). Addition of rapamycin to the cells 3 days after the induction of differentiation did not inhibit the differentiation-associated increase in the amount of GLUT4 protein, GLUT4 mRNA (Fig. 9), or lipid accumulation normally apparent at 8 days (data not shown), suggesting that rapamycin-sensitive pathways are not involved in posttranscriptional control at this stage of adipocyte differentiation. We have now shown that PI 3-kinase activity precipitated with antibodies to phosphotyrosine was transiently increased during adipocyte differentiation. This increase in PI 3-kinase activity does not appear to be attributable to a direct effect of insulin used for induction of differentiation, because insulin was present in the induction medium for the first 4 days whereas PI 3-kinase activation was apparent only 4–6 days after induction in 3T3-F442A cells treated with insulin plus ETYA or in 3T3-L1 cells treated with insulin, IBMX, and dexamethasone. Indeed, little increase in tyrosine phosphorylation of the insulin receptor or the IGF1 receptor was observed in 3T3-F442A cells induced to differentiate with insulin plus ETYA. These data indicate that the transient increase in PI 3-kinase is due not to activation of the insulin or the IGF1 receptor by insulin, which was added to the induction media, but instead to a programmed event during adipocyte differentiation. A similar activation of PI 3-kinase observed during the differentiation of 3T3-F442A cells induced by troglitazone alone also supports this conclusion. Antibodies to either p110 or to p85 coprecipitated a tyrosine- phosphorylated protein of 180 kDa during differentiation of 3T3-F442A cells, and the time course of the association of this protein with p85 was similar to that of PI 3-kinase activation in anti-phosphotyrosine immunoprecipitates. This 180-kDa protein reacted with antibodies to IRS1 on immunoblot analysis. Moreover, the time courses of PI 3-kinase activity precipitated with IRS1 were similar to that of PI 3-kinase activity precipitated with antibodies to phosphotyrosine, suggesting that IRS1 contributes to the activation of PI 3-kinase during adipocyte differentiation. We also showed that IRS2 undergoes tyrosine phosphorylation and associates with PI 3-kinase during adipocyte differentiation. However, the mobility of the tyrosine-phosphorylated protein observed in the immunoprecipitates prepared with antibodies to PI 3-kinase more closely resembles that of IRS1 than that of IRS2. These data suggest that the major tyrosine-phosphorylated protein that associates with and activates PI 3-kinase during differentiation of 3T3-F442A cells is IRS1, although IRS2 also may contribute to PI 3-kinase activation during adipocyte differentiation. Sun et al. (32Sun X.J. Sebastian P. Wang L.-M. Zhang Y. Yenush L. Burks D. Myers Jr., M.G. Glasheen J.E. Copeland N.G. Jenkins N.A. Pierce J.H. White M.F. Mol. Endocrinol. 1997; 11: 251-262Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar) have shown that the amount of IRS2 in 3T3-L1 cells and isolated rat adipocytes is less than that of IRS1. Our data may reflect the relative abundance of these two proteins in 3T3-F442A cells. IRS1 was originally identified as a substrate of the insulin receptor family of tyrosine kinases and was subsequently shown to become phosphorylated in response to ligands, such as growth hormone as well as various interferons and interleukins (27White M.F. Diabetologia. 1997; 40: 2-17Crossref PubMed Scopus (465) Google Scholar), whose receptors are thought to be coupled with the JAK family of tyrosine kinases (33Schindler C. Darnell Jr., J.E. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1995; 64: 621-651Crossref PubMed Scopus (1657) Google Scholar). However, we could not detect tyrosine phosphorylation of Jak1, Jak2, Jak3, or Tyk2 in 3T3-F442A cells 4 days after induction of differentiation with insulin and ETYA (data not shown), suggesting that none of these tyrosine kinases is responsible for PI 3-kinase activation during adipocyte differentiation. Immunoprecipitation and immunoblot analysis with antibodies to phosphotyrosine revealed that several proteins other than IRS1 became tyrosine-phosphorylated during differentiation of 3T3-F442A cells. Thus, one of these tyrosine-phosphorylated proteins may be a tyrosine kinase that phosphorylates IRS1. We used two structurally diverse dominant negative mutants of PI 3-kinase to inhibit activation of the enzyme during adipocyte differentiation because pharmacological inhibitors have been shown to attenuate the activity of enzymes other than PI 3-kinase (15Toker A Cantley L.C. Nature. 1997; 387: 673-676Crossref PubMed Scopus (1229) Google Scholar, 34Brunn G.J. Williams J. Sabers C. Wiederrecht G. Lawrence Jr., J.C. Abraham R.T. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 5256-5267Crossref PubMed Scopus (626) Google Scholar). Whereas Δp85 inhibits PI 3-kinase activation by competing with the endogenous enzyme for association with tyrosine-phosphorylated proteins, p110N inhibits the enzyme by competing with endogenous p110 for association with p85. 2T. Takata, W. Ogawa, and M. Kasuga, manuscript in preparation.Overexpression of these mutants inhibited both the activation of PI 3-kinase and adipocyte differentiation induced by exposure of 3T3-F442A cells either to insulin plus ETYA or to troglitazone alone, indicating that PI 3-kinase activation is required for adipogenesis. We showed that Δp85 or p110N did not affect expression of PPARγ at either the mRNA or protein level, possibly consistent with the observation that the increases in PPARγ mRNA and protein induced by insulin plus ETYA appeared to peak before maximal PI 3-kinase activation. Although PPARγ is an important transcriptional regulator during adipocyte differentiation, other transcription factors, such as C/EBPα, -β, -δ, and ADD-1/SREBP1 also contribute to this process, at least in 3T3-L1 cells induced with insulin, IBMX, and dexamethasone (2Hwang C.-S. Loftus T.M. Mandrup S. Lane M.D. Annu. Rev. Cell Dev. Biol. 1997; 13: 231-259Crossref PubMed Scopus (211) Google Scholar, 9Tonztoz P. Hu E. Spiegelman B.M.

The differentiation-associated increases in the abundance of mRNAs encoding the adipocyte marker proteins GLUT4, adipsin, and aP2 in 3T3-F442A cells also were not inhibited by expression of the dominant negative mutants of PI 3-kinase. Thus, transcriptional control of the corresponding genes appears to be independent of PI 3-kinase, regardless of the transcription factors involved in this control. Akt, also known as protein kinase B, is one of the downstream effector of PI 3-kinase (35Franke T.F. Kaplan D.R. Cantley L.C. Cell. 1997; 88: 435-437Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1528) Google Scholar). It was reported that Akt fused with a viral Gag protein or tagged with a membrane-targeted signal sequence shows higher kinase activity than wild type Akt, and that overexpression of these mutant proteins into 3T3-L1 preadipocytes caused spontaneous differentiation with increased expression of mRNA of aP2 or C/EBPα (36Magun R. Burgering B.M.T. Coffer P.J. Pardasani D. Lin Y. Chabot J. Sorisky A. Endocrinology. 1995; 137: 3590-3593Crossref Scopus (152) Google Scholar, 37Kohn A.D. Summers S.A. Birnbaum M.J. Roth R.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 271: 31372-31378Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (1097) Google Scholar). These findings suggest that signals transmitted through PI 3-kinase are involved in transcriptional regulation of adipogenesis. However, we have shown that activation of PI 3-kinase was observed exclusively at a specific stage of adipocyte differentiation. It is thus possible that expression of a constitutively active Akt at a stage when PI 3-kinase is not normally activated modulates the transcriptional control which is not physiologically regulated by PI 3-kinase during adipocyte differentiation. Inhibition of PI 3-kinase activation during differentiation prevented the increase in the amounts of adipocyte-specific proteins in 3T3-F442A cells, presumably by a posttranscriptional mechanism given that the corresponding mRNAs were unaffected. This effect could theoretically be mediated through control of protein translation or control of protein turnover. In this regard, PI 3-kinase is thought to contribute to ligand-stimulated protein synthesis at several steps, including activation of initiation factor eIF-2B (38Welsh G.I. Stokes C.M. Wang X. Sakaue H. Ogawa W. Kasuga M. Proud C.G. FEBS Lett. 1997; 410: 418-422Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar), phosphorylation of PHAS-I/4E-BP1 (39von Manteuffel S.R. Gingras A.C. Ming X.F.

FEBS Lett. 1997; 410: 78-82Crossref PubMed Scopus (487) Google Scholar). Furthermore, PI 3-kinase might contribute to the differentiation of cells in which this process is sensitive to pharmacological inhibitors of the enzyme (17Kimura K. Hattori S. Kabuyama Y. Shizawa Y.

It is known that rapamycin, a bacterial macrolide, attenuates mitogen-stimulated protein synthesis by 10–30% (30Jefferies H.B.J. Reinhard C. Kozma S.C. Thomas G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Thomas G. FEBS Lett. 1997; 410: 78-82Crossref PubMed Scopus (487) Google Scholar,41Jefferies H.B. Fumagalli S. Dennis P.B. Reinhard C. Pearson R.B. Thomas G. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 3693-3704Crossref PubMed Scopus (813) Google Scholar). We have shown that addition of rapamycin to 3T3-F442A cells 3 days after the induction of differentiation with insulin plus ETYA had no effect on the differentiation-associated increase in the amount of GLUT4 protein or adipocyte differentiation as assessed by lipid accumulation, whereas addition of genistein at the same stage of differentiation completely abolished the expression of GLUT4 at posttranscriptional step. These results suggest that rapamycin sensitive-mechanism is not required for adipogenesis at this stage of differentiation. In conclusion, we have demonstrated a stage-specific activation of PI 3-kinase, to which tyrosine phosphorylation of IRS1 may contribute, during adipocyte differentiation. Furthermore, this activation of PI 3-kinase increases the expression of adipocyte-specific proteins at a posttranscriptional level. The tyrosine kinase responsible for the activation of PI 3-kinase and the mechanism by which this protein kinase is activated remain unknown, but their identification and elucidation, respectively, should increase further our understanding of the regulation of adipocyte differentiation.

However, virtually nothing is known regarding its organization in the limited extracellular space between these cells. We have used metabolic labeling with [3H]glucosamine and [35S]sulfate and a hyaluronan-specific biotinylated probe to study the metabolism of hyaluronan and its localization in monolayer cultures of a rat epidermal keratinocyte cell line. Hyaluronan (∼20 fg/cell) was present on the apical and lateral surfaces of the cells in two nearly equal pools, either in patches (∼160/cell) or diffusely spread. The hyaluronan in the patches is bound to CD44 as indicated by co-localization with an antibody to CD44, and by displacement with hyaluronan decasaccharides as well as with an antibody that blocks hyaluronan binding to CD44. The inability of hyaluronan oligomers shorter than 10 monosaccharides to displace hyaluronan suggests that CD44 dimerization or cooperative interactions are required for tight binding.

Hyaluronan is well known as a constituent of connective tissue extracellular matrices, but more recent studies have also demonstrated its abundance in stratified squamous epithelia including the epidermis (1Tammi R.

In contrast with connective tissue extracellular matrices that contain mixtures of collagens, fibronectins, other multiadhesive glycoproteins, proteoglycans, and hyaluronan, hyaluronan is the only known extracellular matrix macromolecule present in high concentration, ∼2 mg/ml, in the small extracellular space between adjacent epithelial cells (keratinocytes) that form the epidermis (4Tammi R.

Physiol. 1995; 164: 240-248Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). Additionally, studies of human skin organ cultures have shown that the hyaluronan within the epidermis is rapidly turned over (6Tammi R. Säämänen A.-M. Maibach H.I. Tammi M. J. Invest. Dermatol. 1991; 97: 126-130Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), an observation that suggests that the epidermis possesses efficient mechanisms to catabolize hyaluronan that are closely coordinated with its synthesis. Although the coating of keratinocytes by hyaluronan is not generally appreciated, it is widely known that cell types of mesodermal origin (7Munaim S.I. Klagsbrun M. Toole B.P. Dev.

These coats 1) are removed by digestion with highly specific hyaluronidase, 2) can be stabilized by the serum-derived protein inter-α-trypsin inhibitor which interacts with hyaluronan (12Blom A.

Extracellular hyaluronan is often anchored to CD44, a ubiquitous, abundant, and structurally variable plasma membrane receptor that has a hyaluronan binding domain (17Lesley J. Hyman R. Kincade P.W. Adv. Immunol. 1993; 54: 271-335Crossref PubMed Scopus (1032) Google Scholar). Smaller amounts of hyaluronan may bind to RHAMM, a receptor involved in cell motility and cell transformation through hyaluronan-dependent signaling involving tyrosine phosphorylation (18Hall C.L. Wang C. Lange L.A. Turley E.A. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 126: 575-588Crossref PubMed Scopus (225) Google Scholar). In addition, some cell-surface hyaluronan appears to remain tethered to hyaluronan synthase, while biosynthesis continues on the cytoplasmic side of the plasma membrane (19Kitchen J.R. Cysyk R.L.

Still, current understanding of the mechanisms of hyaluronan binding to CD44 and other receptors on normal adherent cells, and the role that these interactions have in hyaluronan organization and catabolism, remains far from complete. We have developed a rat keratinocyte model for epidermal differentiation that is suitable to explore these issues. This epidermal keratinocyte cell line is unique in its ability to reform an epidermis essentially identical to native tissue in the absence of feeder cells when cultured at an air-liquid interface (30MacCallum D. Lillie J. Skin Pharmacol. 1990; 3: 86-96Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar) and exhibits a nearly complete set of morphological differentiation markers (31Baden H.P. Kubilus J. J. Invest. Dermatol. 1983; 80: 124-130Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar,32Haydock P.V. Blomquist C. Brumbaugh S. Dale B.A. Holbrook K.A. Fleckman P. J. Invest. Dermatol. 1993; 101: 118-126Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). These cells can also be maintained in a continuous growth phase when regularly trypsinized and cultured as conventional monolayers on plastic dishes. In this report, the essentially monolayer character of recently subcultivated rat keratinocytes enabled us to quantitate and characterize the hyaluronan bound on keratinocyte cell surfaces in ways that are not technically feasible in complete epidermis covered with an impermeable stratum corneum. Our results show that about half of the hyaluronan is bound on the apical and lateral keratinocyte surfaces to CD44 and about half remains bound, most likely to hyaluronan synthase. Furthermore, hyaluronan oligosaccharides with at least five repeat units (decasaccharides) are required to displace hyaluronan from CD44. A newborn rat epidermal keratinocyte (REK)1 cell line was developed by MacCallum and Lillie (30MacCallum D. Lillie J. Skin Pharmacol. 1990; 3: 86-96Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar) from neonatal rat epidermal cells originally isolated by Baden and Kubilus (31Baden H.P. Kubilus J. J. Invest. Dermatol. 1983; 80: 124-130Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). REKs were cultured in Dulbecco's minimum essential medium (low glucose, Life Technologies, Inc.) with 10% fetal bovine serum (HyClone, Logan, UT) at 37 °C in a humidified atmosphere containing 5% CO2. Cells were passaged when confluent using 0.05% trypsin (w/v), 0.02% EDTA (w/v) in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) (Life Technologies, Inc.). When seeded at 10,000 cells/cm2, the cells grew to confluency in about 2 days and formed multilayers 2–4 cells thick after 4–6 additional days of culture. For biochemical assays and radiolabeling, the cells were grown close to confluency in 6-well plates and incubated in the presence of 20 and 100 μCi/ml [3H]glucosamine and [35S]sulfate (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech, Little Chalfont, UK), respectively. For microscopic studies, the cells were plated in 8-well chamber slides (Lab-Tek and Nalge, Naperville, IL), 10,000–30,000 cells/well, precoated for 30 min at 37 °C with fetal bovine serum. For ELISA-like assays of cell-associated hyaluronan in situ, the cells were grown on Costar Transwell inserts (polycarbonate, 0.4-μm pore size, 4.5 cm2, 6-well plate, Costar Corp., Cambridge, MA) seeded at 10,000 cells/cm2. Cells were grown in 6-well plates (9.6 cm2/well) in 1–2 ml of medium and subsequently washed with 2 × 250 μl of Earle's balanced salt solution (EBSS, Life Technologies, Inc.). The combined medium and washes were designated as “medium.” The cell layer was trypsinized in 0.5 ml of 0.025% trypsin (w/v) and 0.02% EDTA (w/v) (Sigma). After removing the cells, each plate was washed with 0.25% (w/v) soybean trypsin inhibitor (Sigma) in 100 μl of EBSS and then with 200 μl of EBSS. The cell suspension, combined with the washes, was centrifuged, and the supernatant designated as “trypsinate” or “cell-surface hyaluronan.” The cell pellet was suspended in 200 μl of EBSS and designated as the “intracellular” hyaluronan fraction. Carrier (4 μg of hyaluronan in 40 μl, Healon®, Amersham Pharmacia Biotech, Uppsala, Sweden) and 4 volumes of ethanol saturated with NaCl were added to each medium, trypsinate, and intracellular sample. After 1 h at −20 °C, precipitates were centrifuged for 15 min at 2500 ×g. Each precipitate was suspended in 200 μl of 50 mm sodium acetate, pH 5.8, containing 5 mmcysteine HCl and 5 mm EDTA to which 50 μg of papain (Sigma) in 50 μl of water was added followed by incubation at 60 °C for 4 h. The samples were heated at 100 °C for 10 min, centrifuged at 13,000 × g for 15 min, and supernatants containing hyaluronan and other glycosaminoglycans recovered. Cetylpyridinium chloride (1% in 20 mm NaCl, 4 volumes) was added to each supernatant followed by incubation for 1 h at room temperature. After centrifugation at 13,000 × g for 15 min, each supernatant was carefully removed by aspiration. Each precipitate was washed with 1 ml of H2O, centrifuged, and the supernatant discarded as above. Each cetylpyridinium chloride precipitate was dissolved in 50 μl of 4 m guanidine HCl, and 900 μl of ethanol, saturated with NaCl, was added. After 1 h at −20 °C, each sample was centrifuged, and the supernatant removed as described above. Each purified sample was dissolved in 50 μl of 50 mm sodium acetate, pH 6.7, and digested for 3 h at 37 °C with 25 milliunits of chondroitinase ABC and 1 milliunit of Streptococcus hyaluronidase (both from Seikagaku Kogyo Co., Tokyo, Japan), and 10–45 μl were injected onto a 1 × 30 cm Superdex Peptide column (Pharmacia) and eluted at 0.5 ml/min with 0.1 m NH4HCO3. The eluent was monitored at 232 nm, and aliquots of the 250-μl fractions were counted for 3H and 35S. Undigested glycosaminoglycans, consisting mainly of heparan sulfate, eluted near the void volume, whereas disulfated, monosulfated, and non-sulfated disaccharides were eluted in this order as separate peaks before the total volume of the column. The carrier hyaluronan produced a disaccharide peak at 232 nm which was used to monitor the recovery (about 80%) and correct for any losses in purification. The radiolabeled disaccharide peaks from Superdex chromatography were dried, redissolved in water, and their identities confirmed by ion exchange chromatography. The non-sulfated disaccharides and monosulfated chondroitin disaccharides were fractionated on 4 × 50-mm Carbopak MA1 and PA1 columns (Dionex, Sunnyvale, CA) eluted isocratically with 20 and 500 mm sodium phosphate, pH 7.0, respectively. The disulfated disaccharides were chromatographed on a 0.4–1.0 m LiCl gradient on the PA1 column. More than 85% of the radioactivity in the dried peaks coeluted with standards (Seikagaku) in the expected positions. Ion exchange chromatography on Carbopak MA1 showed that digests of samples from these keratinocytes did not contain ΔDi-0S, the nonsulfated disaccharide from chondroitin sulfate. Hence the nonsulfated peak in the Superdex eluents contained only ΔDi-HA and indicated the content of hyaluronan. Incorporation of label from35SO4 provides a measure of the chemical quantity of the chondroitin sulfate synthesized during the labeling period. The [3H]glucosamine incorporated into the same disaccharides provides an estimate of the effective specific activity of the N-acetylglucosamine precursor pool and hence the chemical content of newly synthesized hyaluronan, as described in detail previously (33Yanagishita M. Salustri A. Hascall V.C. Methods Enzymol. 1989; 179: 435-445Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). The accuracy of hyaluronan content calculated from the double labeling technique was confirmed as follows: 1) by pooling media and trypsinates for parallel, ELISA-like, hyaluronan-competitive binding assays (5Ågren U.M. Tammi M. Tammi R. J. Cell. Physiol. 1995; 164: 240-248Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar), and 2) by determination of unlabeled disaccharides in chondroitinase and hyaluronidase digests without added carrier hyaluronan, at 232 nm on the Carbopak MA1 column as described above. Commercial hyaluronan from human umbilical cord (Sigma) was dissolved in 0.1m sodium acetate, 0.1 m NaCl, pH 6.0. Bovine testicular hyaluronidase (∼6000 units/mg, Calbiochem) was incubated with the hyaluronan at 37 °C until the size distribution peaked at 10–20 monosaccharide units, as determined by elution on an analytical Superdex 75 gel filtration column (Pharmacia). Preparative fractionation of the oligosaccharides was done on a 5 × 95-cm column of Superdex 30 (Pharmacia), eluted with 0.1 mNH4HCO3. The fractions corresponding to the peak of each oligosaccharide were pooled, lyophilized twice, dissolved in the appropriate medium, and filtered sterile. Ion exchange high pressure liquid chromatography of aliquots of the purified oligosaccharide peaks on a 9 × 250-mm Propak PA1 column (Dionex), eluted with an NH4HCO3 gradient, showed 3% cross-contamination of the HA6 with HA8 but no detectable HA10, and 9 and 7% cross-contaminations of the HA10 with HA8 and HA12, respectively. HA8 had a 3% cross-contamination from both HA6 and HA10. The hyaluronan-specific probe, biotinylated hyaluronan binding complex (bHABC), was purified from a 4 m guanidine HCl extract of bovine articular cartilage, dialyzed, and digested with trypsin, as described previously (34Tammi R. Ågren U.M. Tuhkanen A.-L. Tammi M. Prog. Histochem. Cytochem. 1994; 29: 1-77Crossref PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar). The ternary complex with the G1 domain of aggrecan, the link protein, and hyaluronan was purified using hydroxyapatite chromatography and gel filtration on Sephacryl S-1000 (Pharmacia), followed by biotinylation. Hyaluronan and excess biotin were then removed from the complex by dissociative gel filtration on Sephacryl S-400 (Pharmacia) (34Tammi R. Ågren U.M. Tuhkanen A.-L. Tammi M. Prog. Histochem. Cytochem. 1994; 29: 1-77Crossref PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar). In SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis analysis, the probe exhibited biotinylated G1 domain of aggrecan and biotinylated link protein as the only silver-stained and biotinylated proteins. Keratinocytes were seeded at 10,000 cells/cm2 and grown to confluence on Costar Transwell® polycarbonate 0.4-μm pore membrane inserts. Standardized 0.55-cm2 discs were punched out of the membrane. The cell layers on the discs were fixed and incubated with bHABC as described below for histological staining. After washing, the discs were incubated for 30 min at 37 °C with 100 μl of streptavidin peroxidase (Vector, Inc, Burlingame, CA), 1:10,000 dilution in 150 mm NaCl and 20 mm Tris acetate, pH 8.2, washed 3 × for 5 min with the phosphate buffer, and 100 μl of 50 mm phosphate/citrate buffer, pH 5.0 (Sigma), containing 2 mg/ml o-phenylenediamine (Sigma) and 0.025% H2O2 (v/v), was added. After 30 min at 37 °C, aliquots from the incubation solutions were read at 405 nm. The linearity of the assay was confirmed by a concentration series of hyaluronan (0.01–100 ng/100 μl) cross-linked with 1-ethyl-3-(3-dimethylaminopropyl)-carbodiimide HCl, (Sigma) onto Covalink® plates (Nunc, Roskilde, Denmark). Background absorbance (15–20% of total), obtained using the bHABC probe, pretreated with hyaluronan oligosaccharides, was subtracted. Streptomyceshyaluronidase digestion removed 95–100% of the specific absorbance,i.e. produced the same values as the oligosaccharide-treated probe, indicating the specificity of the reaction. The standards chondroitin, chondroitin 4-sulfate (chondroitin sulfate A), chondroitin 6-sulfate (chondroitin sulfate C), and heparan sulfate were purchased from Seikagaku. Each cell layer to be analyzed was washed with Dulbecco′s PBS (D-PBS) (Life Technologies, Inc.) and fixed at room temperature for 20 min either in 2% paraformaldehyde (v/v) and 0.5% glutaraldehyde (v/v) inD-PBS for electron microscopy and light microscopy with peroxidase detection or in paraformaldehyde alone for fluorescence microscopy. After fixation, the cells were washed 3 times for 2 min each with D-PBS and then blocked in 1% BSA (w/v) containing 0.3% Triton X-100 (v/v) and 50 mm glycine inD-PBS, for 30 min at 37 °C. For light microscopy, the bHABC probe, diluted to 2–10 μg/ml in 3% BSA (w/v), was added to the fixed cells, and incubated overnight at 4 °C. The slides were then washed and treated with avidin-biotin peroxidase (ABC standard kit, Vector) for 1 h. The color was developed using DAB and H2O2 (kit from Vector) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Counterstaining was done with hematoxylin for 2 min before mounting either in Chrystalmount® or DPX® (Biomeda, Foster City, CA). For electron microscopy, fixation, incubation with bHABC, blocking, and washes were done as for light microscopy. The samples were then incubated with streptavidin/gold (LM grade, Amersham Corp.) 1:40 dilution for 1 h. After washing, the samples were postfixed in 1% glutaraldehyde (v/v) for 20 min and washed 5 times for 1 min with distilled water. Silver enhancement was done according to the manufacturer's instructions (IntenSE M, Amersham Corp.). The cells were dehydrated in graded ethanol and embedded in Spurr's resin. Thin sections were cut, placed onto Formvar-coated copper grids, stained with uranyl acetate, and viewed with a JEOL 1200 EX microscope. The specificity of the staining was controlled by pre-digesting the fixed cultures with Streptomyces hyaluronidase (100 turbidity reducing units/ml, 50 mm sodium acetate buffer, pH 5.0, 3 h at 37 °C) in the presence of protease inhibitors (4Tammi R. Ripellino J.A. Margolis R.U. Maibach H.I. Tammi M. J. Invest. Dermatol. 1989; 92: 326-332Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar) or by preincubating the bHABC probe with HA oligosaccharides (length ∼20 monosaccharides, 3 μg/1 μg bHABC) to reveal possible nonspecific binding of the probe. The cells were grown on 8-well chamber slides and stained for hyaluronan with DAB as a chromogen, as described above, but without hematoxylin counterstaining. A Leitz BK II microscope with 16 ×/0.45 numerical aperture objective (Leitz, Wetzlar, Germany) was connected with a 12-bit digital camera (Photometrics CH 200, Tucson, AZ) equipped with a KAF 1400 CCD detector (Eastman Kodac Co.). The optimum wavelength for DAB was found at 543 nm using an interference filter (Schott, Wiesbaden, Germany). Camera control and image analysis were done with IPLab software (Signal Analytics, Vienna, VA). The settings of the microscope and camera were kept constant during the study. Spatial resolution of the system was 1.43 μm/pixel. During system calibration and measuring, each image of interest was corrected using a flat fielding algorithm. The imaging system was calibrated with neutral density filters (Schott) in the range of 0 to 3 OD to convert the pixel density values into the linear, standardized scale of OD.

Area-integrated mean OD values, including both DAB-positive and background intensities, were calculated for each whole digitized area, excluding possible artifact areas. In addition, DAB-positive staining areas were estimated from binary images with a cut-off at an OD value of 0.13. Based on the positive area data and the sum of the pixels that fulfilled the positivity criteria, the mean area-integrated OD values for the DAB-positive material were calculated accordingly, and those data were used for the presentation of the results. The cells were fixed and blocked with BSA as described above and then incubated overnight at 4 °C with the OX 50 antibody (Biosource Inc., Camarillo, CA) at 1:100 dilution in 3% BSA. After washing, the cells were incubated for 1 h with biotinylated anti-mouse secondary antibody (Vector) diluted to 1:100 in 1% BSA. After washing, they were treated with avidin-biotin peroxidase, developed with DAB, counterstained with hematoxylin, and mounted in Chrystalmount® or DPX®, as described above for bHABC. Negative controls included isotype-specific control serum (Sigma) and omission of the primary antibody. For double staining of hyaluronan and CD44, the cells were fixed in 2% paraformaldehyde, blocked as described above, and then incubated overnight at 4 °C with the OX 50 antibody (1:100 dilution) and bHABC (3 μg/ml) in 3% BSA. After washing, the cells were incubated for 1 h with fluorescein isothiocyanate-labeled anti-mouse secondary antibody (Boehringer GMBH, Mannheim, Germany, 1:50) and Texas Red-labeled streptavidin (Vector) 1:1000 in 1% BSA, washed, and mounted in Vectashield (Vector). Recently confluent or near-confluent cultures of REKs were incubated in the presence of monoclonal antibodies against CD44: 1M7 (Zymed Laboratories Inc., San Francisco, CA, and a gift from Dr. W. Knudson, Chicago), Ox 50 (Biosource Int., Camarillo, CA), and Hermes 3 (a gift from Dr. Sirpa Jalkanen, Turku) and with non-immune IgG (Sigma) before staining for hyaluronan as described above. Recently confluent cultures of rat keratinocytes were labeled for times between 6 and 24 h with [3H]glucosamine and [35S]sulfate. The3H-labeled hyaluronan was determined for medium, cell surface (trypsinate), and intracellular compartments, and the values were used to determine the mass of [3H]hyaluronan with the double label method. As shown in Fig. 1, the content of newly synthesized hyaluronan in the trypsinate (i.e. on the cell surface) reached a plateau value by ∼18 h. The [3H]hyaluronan in the medium continued to increase linearly, after an initial lag, during 24 h indicating continued synthesis of hyaluronan throughout. The intracellular [3H]hyaluronan (i.e. the cell pellet after trypsin digestion) remained constant and low (∼4% of the total at 24 h). The kinetics to steady state content of [3H]hyaluronan in the trypsinates indicates that the half-life of a newly synthesized hyaluronan molecule on the cell surface is only ∼8 h and the equilibrium content is ∼200 pg/104 cells (or ∼20 fg/cell). The loss of [3H]hyaluronan from the cell surface reflects loss to the medium and some internalization for catabolism. Confluent cultures of keratinocytes were incubated at 37 °C for 2 h with hyaluronan oligosaccharides of different sizes, and the displacement of cell-surface hyaluronan was determined using the in situ hyaluronan assay described under “Experimental Procedures.” Oligosaccharides HA10(Fig. 2 a) or larger (not shown), when used at 0.3–1.0 mg/ml, reduced cell layer-associated hyaluronan in this ELISA assay to 45–56% of controls. In contrast, HA6 had no effect (Fig. 2 a). Related glycosaminoglycans, such as chondroitin and chondroitin 6-sulfate, did not displace hyaluronan even at high concentrations (Fig. 2 a). The oligosaccharide HA8 and heparan sulfate were also without effect (data not shown). A nearly identical displacement of cell-surface [3H]hyaluronan (to 53–55% of controls) was found in cultures labeled for 24 h with [3H]glucosamine in the presence of HA14 oligosaccharides (Fig. 2 b). Again, HA6 oligosaccharides had no effect. This confirmed that HA6 was unable to displace endogenous hyaluronan and that 3H-labeled cell-surface hyaluronan had equilibrated with the total content of hyaluronan on cell surfaces. Increasing oligosaccharide size from 10 to 18 monosaccharides did not significantly increase the release of cell-surface hyaluronan (data not shown). Hyaluronan molecules on the surfaces of the keratinocytes, therefore, are present in two different pools, one with the characteristics of a specific receptor (displaced by HA≥10-oligosaccharides, but not with other glycosaminoglycans), and one not displaced and likely still attached to hyaluronan synthase. Localization of hyaluronan with the biotinylated probe (bHABC) in confluent cultures revealed dense patches decorating the cell-cell contact areas, as well as spots and linear deposits on the apical surfaces (Fig. 3 a). In contrast, the underside of the keratinocytes, facing the plastic or glass surface (position determined by the focal plane), was almost always devoid of hyaluronan. Digestion with eitherStreptomyces hyaluronidase (Fig. 3 b) or trypsin (Fig. 3 c) completely removed the cell-surface signal. An intracellular, granular hyaluronan signal was present in some of the cells (Fig. 3 b). The ability of trypsin to release all cell-surface hyaluronan was also confirm"

Huntington's disease (HD)1 is a progressive neurodegenerative disorder with an autosomal dominant inheritance (1The Huntington's Disease Collaborative Research Group Cell. 1993; 72: 971-983Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (7076) Google Scholar). The genetic defect of the HD gene involves an expansion of a CAG repeat where normal and expanded HD allele sizes range between 6 to 37 and 34 to 121, respectively (1The Huntington's Disease Collaborative Research Group Cell. 1993; 72: 971-983Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (7076) Google Scholar, 2Harper P.S.

The most common pathologic allele in the HD gene has between 40 and 49 CAG repeats and is clinically manifested by middle age onset with choreiform movement, mental impairment, and cognitive dysfunction due to a selective loss of striatal, cortical, and hippocampal neurons (1The Huntington's Disease Collaborative Research Group Cell. 1993; 72: 971-983Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (7076) Google Scholar, 2Harper P.S.

Juvenile HD, associated with a longer CAG repeat, is characterized by a severe and diffuse loss of neurons throughout the brains (1The Huntington's Disease Collaborative Research Group Cell. 1993; 72: 971-983Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (7076) Google Scholar, 2Harper P.S.

Although the HD gene has been identified for several years, the molecular mechanism by which mutated huntingtin induces neurons to die remains unclear. Many studies have suggested that glutamate-mediated excitotoxicity may play an essential role in the pathogenesis of HD (7Coyle J.T. Puttfarcken P. Science. 1993; 262: 689-695Crossref PubMed Scopus (3532) Google Scholar). Administration of NMDA receptor agonists such as quinolinic acid induces a behavioral phenotype and neuropathology strikingly similar to that observed in HD patients (8Beal M.F. Kowall N.W. Ellison D.W. Mazurek M.F. Swartz K.J. Martin J.B. Nature. 1986; 321: 168-171Crossref PubMed Scopus (1113) Google Scholar). Apparently, polyglutamine repeat-expanded huntingtin and NMDA receptors may stimulate a common neurotoxic pathway to cause neuronal injury. Therefore, identification of such a neurotoxic pathway may be not only crucial for understanding of the mechanism of neuronal death induced by mutated huntingtin and glutamate, but also for identifying potential drug targets for the treatment of HD as well as other neurodegenerative diseases. Activation of JNKs has also been implicated in neuronal death induced by a wide range of environmental stress stimuli and glutamate-mediated excitotoxicity. In both primary cultured sympathetic neurons and differentiated pheochromocytoma PC12 cells, deprivation of nerve growth factor leads to the JNK activation and neuronal apoptosis (9Ham J. Babij C. Whitfield J. Pfarr C.M. Lallemand D. Yaniv M. Rubin L.L. Neuron. 1995; 14: 927-939Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (757) Google Scholar, 10Xia Z. Dickens M. Raingeaud J. Davis R.J. Greenberg M.E. Science. 1995; 270: 1326-1330Crossref PubMed Scopus (5034) Google Scholar). In primary cultured striatal neurons, stimulation of NMDA receptors leads to activation of JNKs and increases of c-Jun and c-Fos expression (11Schwarzschild M.A. Cole R.L. Hyman S.E. J. Neurosci. 1997; 17: 3455-3466Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Intriguingly, gene-targeted knockout of JNK3, an isoform of JNKs that is almost exclusively expressed in the brain, results in a remarkable resistance to neuronal excitotoxicity induced by kainic acid (12Yang D.D. Kuan C.-Y. Whitmarsh A.J. Rincon M. Zheng T.S. Davis R.J. Rakis P. Flavell R. Nature. 1997; 389: 865-869Crossref PubMed Scopus (1115) Google Scholar). Seizures and hippocampal neuronal apoptosis are prevented, while phosphorylation of c-Jun and the transcription activity of AP-1 are markedly reduced in the JNK3 (−/−) mice (12Yang D.D. Kuan C.-Y. Whitmarsh A.J. Rincon M. Zheng T.S. Davis R.J. Rakis P. Flavell R. Nature. 1997; 389: 865-869Crossref PubMed Scopus (1115) Google Scholar). The present study was undertaken to determine whether expression of full-length polyglutamine expanded huntingtin induces neuronal toxicity and to explore the potential molecular mechanism of neuronal death. I found that expression of full-length huntingtin with 48 or 89 polyglutamine repeats resulted in the JNK activation and apoptotic cell death of an immortalized rat hippocampal neuronal cell line (HN33). Co-expression of a dominant negative form of SEK1 nearly completely blocked mutated huntingtin-mediated neuronal apoptosis. Thus, I conclude that polyglutamine-expanded huntingtin, via activation of JNKs mediates neuronal apoptosis. The first third of the full-length construct was derived by ligation of IT16LL (bp 932–3018) with three different PCR products (bp 2401–3270, bp 637–1429, and 187–858). A 3027-bp cDNA fragment was lifted from this resulting construct and ligated to corresponding sites in the cDNA clone IT15B (bp 3024–10366). The CAG repeat size in this full-length huntingtin construct, pFL16HD, is 16. PCR products were generated from the genomic DNA of an adult patient with 48 CAG repeats and a juvenile onset case with 89 CAG repeats. These PCR products were ligated to replace the corresponding region in pFL16HD to generate the pFL48HD and pFL89HD with 48 and 89 CAG repeats, respectively. Colony hybridization and PCR were used to identify the 48 and 89 CAG huntingtin clones, and positive clones were verified by DNA sequence analysis. HN33 cells, cultured in 10-cm plates were initially maintained in DMEM medium supplemented with 10% of fetal bovine serum. After 20–30 passages, cells became differentiated, exhibiting neurite outgrowth. The medium was switched to DMEM/F-12 (50/50) in which the morphology of HN33 cells remains unaltered after over 100 passages. 50–60% confluent HN33 or 293 cells were washed once with serum-free medium prior to transfection. Transfection was performed using Lipofectin (Boehringer Mannheim) according to the manufacturer's instructions, and fetal bovine serum was added to the medium 12 h after transfection to a final concentration of 1%. 60 μg of plasmid with 10 μl of Lipofectin/60-mm plate was used in all transfection experiments. After 24 h, the transfection medium was removed and replaced by fresh medium with 1% fetal bovine serum. 48–72 h after transfection, 293 cells were harvested and lysed in 1% Nonidet P-40 lysis buffer (14Liu Y.F.

Transfection medium was removed at the time indicated in the figures, and cells were washed once with serum-free medium, fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde, and then permeabilized with 0.1% of Triton X-100 for 2 min. The TUNEL staining (18Gavrieli Y. Sherman Y. Ben-Sasson S.A. J. Cell Biol. 1992; 119: 493-501Crossref PubMed Scopus (9156) Google Scholar) was performed as per the manufacturer's instructions (Boehringer Mannheim). Most apoptotic HN33 cells were detached from the slides. In Figs. 2 A and 3 C, TUNEL stain was performed on remaining attached cells. HN33 cells showing the retraction of neurites and positive stain in the nucleus were recognized as apoptotic. TUNEL stain negative cells (living cells) were counted in the × 20 power field in four different places on the slides, and about 600∼800 control cells were counted.Figure 3Mutated huntingtin-induced apoptosis is mediated by activation of the SEK1-JNK pathway.

HN33 cells were transiently transfected with different plasmids as indicated in the figure. 16 h after transfection, HN33 cells were lysed, and JNK activity was measured as described under “Experimental Procedure.” Data are from a typical experiment that has been repeated three times with similar results. B, increase of JNK activity was determined by analyzing the blots with a densitometer.

Cell lysates were incubated with GST-c-Jun (1–89) fusion proteins immobilized on glutathione-Sepharose beads to separate JNKs. These beads were resuspended in 30 μl of kinase buffer (25 mmTris-HCl, 5 mm β-glycerophosphate, 2 mmdithiothreitol, 0.1 Na3VO4, and 10 mm MgCl2). The kinase assay was performed at 30 °C for 30 min, and the reaction was stopped by adding SDS sample buffer. The samples were resolved in a SDS gel, transferred, and the blot was analyzed by Western blotting using a phospho (Ser-63)-specific c-Jun antibody (New England Biolabs). To assess whether polyglutamine-expanded huntingtin causes neuronal toxicity, full-length huntingtin expression constructs containing 16, 48, or 89 CAG repeats, respectively, were generated by assembly of a combination of reverse transcription-PCR products from normal and human HD lymphoblast and plasmid cDNA clones IT16L and IT15B (1The Huntington's Disease Collaborative Research Group Cell. 1993; 72: 971-983Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (7076) Google Scholar). To test whether the resulting constructs pFL16HD, pFL48HD, or pFL89HD express different huntingtins, they were transiently transfected into 293 embryonic kidney cells. Expression of either normal or polyglutamine-expanded huntingtin in 293 cells did not generate visible cell toxicity, and the rate of cell proliferation remained unaltered. Transfected cells were lysed 72 h after transfection, and the levels of huntingtin expression were analyzed by immunoblotting using an anti-huntingtin monoclonal antibody, 4C8 (15Trottier Y. Devys D. Imbert G. Saudou F. An I. Lutz Y. Weber C. Agid Y. Hirsh E.C. Mandel J.L. Nat. Genet. 1995; 10: 104-110Crossref PubMed Scopus (382) Google Scholar). As shown in Fig. 1, all three huntingtin constructs constitutively express the huntingtin protein. Similar to previous reports (15Trottier Y. Devys D. Imbert G. Saudou F. An I. Lutz Y. Weber C. Agid Y. Hirsh E.C. Mandel J.L. Nat. Genet. 1995; 10: 104-110Crossref PubMed Scopus (382) Google Scholar), mutant proteins migrate slightly slower than normal huntingtin (Fig. 1). Because transfection efficiency is about 40–50% according to β-galactosidase staining (data not shown), the amount of polyglutamine-expanded huntingtin expressed in these transfectants under an optional condition is about three to five times higher than that of endogenous huntingtin in 293 cells (Fig. 1). Next, I examined whether expression of polyglutamine-expanded huntingtin induces neuronal toxicity. Since hippocampus is one of the brain regions affected in HD (2Harper P.S. Huntington's Disease. W. B. Saunders, London1991Google Scholar, 4Reiner A. Albin R.L. Anderson K.D. D'Amato C. Penney J.B. Young A.B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1988; 85: 5733-5737Crossref PubMed Scopus (800) Google Scholar), I used an immortalized rat hippocampal neuronal cell line, HN33, in my experiments (13Hammond D.N. Lee H.J. Tonsgard J.H. Wainer B.H. Brain Res. 1990; 512: 190-200Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). To normalize the expression level in different transfection experiments, 60 μg of plasmid DNA/60-mm plate and the same amount of Lipofectin were used in all experiments, and under this condition, the levels of expression of huntingtin were similar according to huntingtin immunoblotting. Transfection of pcDNA1 (vector) or normal huntingtin with 16 CAG repeats (pFL16HD) did not produce any toxic effect in HN33 cells, and DNA fragmentation was not detectable using TUNEL stain (Fig. 2 A, left and middle panels), although expression of normal huntingtin slightly suppressed proliferation of HN33 cells (Fig. 2 A, middle panel). Expression of mutated huntingtin with 48 or 89 polyglutamine repeats (pFL48HD or pFL89HD), however, clearly induced cell toxicity in HN33 cells. Apoptosis was initially observed between 20 and 24 h after transfection of pFL48HD or pFL89HD. At 48 h after transfection, about ∼75% of HN33 cells were apoptotic. As shown in the right panel of Fig. 2 A, 24 h after transfection of pFL48HD, a small population of HN33 cells was stained positively by TUNEL, and at 48 h after transfection of pFL48HD, most cells were detached from the slide, and most remaining attached cells exhibited DNA fragmentation. Although transfection efficiency is about 30–40%, according to β-galactosidase staining, about 90∼95% of HN33 cells were apoptotic at 72 h after transfection of either pFL48HD or pFL89HD. A similar phenomenon has been observed following injection of the Rac target protein POSH into COS-1 cells, which lead to apoptosis of injected and noninjected neighboring cells (19Tapon N. Nagata K. Lamarche N. Hall A. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 1395-1404Crossref PubMed Scopus (180) Google Scholar). Since POSH is also a JNK activator, one possible explanations is that the JNK-activated apoptotic cells may produce and secrete a toxin that contributes to the death of neighboring cells. In addition, scattered neuronal cells in culture may be more vulnerable to neurotoxic stimuli. Mutated huntingtin with 48 or 89 polyglutamine repeats correlates with middle age and juvenile onset of HD, respectively (5Andrew S.E. Goldberg Y.P. Kremer B. Håkan T. Theilmann J. Adam S. Starr E. Squitieri F. Lin B. Kalchman M.A. Graham R.K. Hayden M.P. Nat. Genet. 1993; 4: 398-403Crossref PubMed Scopus (888) Google Scholar, 6Snell R.G. MacMillan J.C. Cheadle J.P. Fenton I. Lazarou L.P. Davies P. MacDonald M.E. Gusella J.F. Harper P.S. Shaw D.J. Nat. Genet. 1993; 4: 393-397Crossref PubMed Scopus (604) Google Scholar). To examine whether mutated huntingtin with 89 polyglutamine repeats generates earlier and more severe neuronal toxicity than that induced by mutated huntingtin with 48 polyglutamine repeats, I performed a detailed time course of HN33 cell survival following transfection with different huntingtin constructs. HN33 cells were transfected with pcDNA1, pFL16HD, pFL48HD, or pFL89HD, and after different times of transfection as indicated in Fig. 2 B, cells were fixed and TUNEL-stained. Since most apoptotic cells were detached from the plates, TUNEL-negative cells were counted. Compared with transfection of pcDNA1 (control), transfection with normal huntingtin containing 16 polyglutamine repeats did not significantly reduce the number of TUNEL-negative cells between 12 and 72 h after transfection (Fig. 2 B). As expected, neuronal toxicity induced by transfection with mutated huntingtin containing 89 polyglutamine repeats occurred 2–3 h earlier than that mediated by mutated huntingtin with 48 polyglutamine repeats (Fig. 2 B). To determine further whether polyglutamine-expanded huntingtin-induced cell death is apoptotic, an ICE inhibitor (zVAD-frm) or CPP32 inhibitor (zDEVD-frm) was added to the medium during transfection (16Sarin A.L. Wu M.-L. Henkart P.A. J. Exp. Med. 1996; 184: 2445-2449Crossref PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar, 17Rodriguez I. Matsuura K. Ody C. Nagata S. Vassalli P. J. Exp. Med. 1996; 184: 2067-2072Crossref PubMed Scopus (271) Google Scholar). Both the ICE and CPP32 inhibitors completely blocked apoptotic cell death induced by expression of mutated huntingtin with 48 or 89 polyglutamine repeats. TUNEL staining was negative (Fig. 2 C), and the rate of cell proliferation was similar to the control (transfected with pFL16HD) at both 48 and 72 h after transfection. ICE cleaves inactive CPP32 precursor, thereby activating the enzyme (20Vaux D.L. Strasser A Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 2239-2244Crossref PubMed Scopus (909) Google Scholar). This result therefore suggests that expression of polyglutamine-expanded huntingtin may stimulate ICE, which in turn activates CPP32 to induce apoptotic cell death. I then explored the possible molecular mechanism of polyglutamine-expanded huntingtin-mediated neuronal toxicity. Since activation of JNK has been implicated in neuronal apoptosis induced by glutamate, kainic acid, or deprivation of neurotrophic factors (9Ham J. Babij C. Whitfield J. Pfarr C.M. Lallemand D. Yaniv M. Rubin L.L. Neuron. 1995; 14: 927-939Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (757) Google Scholar, 10Xia Z. Dickens M. Raingeaud J. Davis R.J. Greenberg M.E.

Nature. 1997; 389: 865-869Crossref PubMed Scopus (1115) Google Scholar), and since glutamate-mediated excitotoxicity may be involved in HD neuronal loss (7Coyle J.T. Puttfarcken P. Science. 1993; 262: 689-695Crossref PubMed Scopus (3532) Google Scholar, 8Beal M.F. Kowall N.W. Ellison D.W. Mazurek M.F. Swartz K.J. Martin J.B. Nature. 1986; 321: 168-171Crossref PubMed Scopus (1113) Google Scholar), I investigated whether expression of polyglutamine-expanded huntingtin induces activation of JNKs. GST c-Jun (1–89 amino acids) was utilized as a substrate to measure JNK activity. HN33 cells were transfected with pcDNA1, pFL16HD, pFL48HD, or pFL89HD, and 16 h after transfection, cells were lysed, and JNK was precipitated by GST-c-Jun fusion protein beads. A low level of JNK activation was observed in pcDNA1-transfected cells (Fig. 3 A, Control). This result is consistent with the data obtained from primary cultures of rat striatal neurons where a basal level of JNK activation was also observed (12Yang D.D. Kuan C.-Y. Whitmarsh A.J. Rincon M. Zheng T.S. Davis R.J. Rakis P. Flavell R. Nature. 1997; 389: 865-869Crossref PubMed Scopus (1115) Google Scholar). Transfection of normal huntingtin with 16 polyglutamine repeats did not further increase the amount of serine phosphorylated GST-c-Jun and thus did not stimulate JNK activity in HN33 cells (Fig. 3, A and B). Expression of mutated huntingtin with 48 or 89 polyglutamine repeats, however, significantly increased the level of JNK activity. As shown in Fig. 3, A and B, serine phosphorylated GST-c-Jun was increased 7–8-fold 16 h upon transfection of either pFL48HD or pFL89HD, similar to the level of JNK activity induced by 30 min of UV irradiation (Fig. 3, A and B). These results indicate that the polyglutamine repeat expansion of huntingtin enables it to activate JNKs in HN33 cells and the JNK activation precedes apoptotic cell death. Next, I explored whether activation of JNK is responsible for polyglutamine-expanded huntingtin-induced apoptotic cell death in HN33 cells. JNK is specifically activated by SEK1 (21Sanchez I. Hughea R.T. Mayer B.J. Yee K. Woodgett J.R. Avruch J. Kyriakis J.M. Zon L.I. Nature. 1994; 380: 75-79Google Scholar), and a dominant negative mutant form of SEK1 (K54R) can act as an inhibitor of the wild-type, blocking its phosphorylation and the activation of JNK (22Lin A. Minden A. Martinetto H. Claret F.-X. Lange-Carter C. Mercurio F. Johnson G.L. Karin M. Science. 1995; 268: 286-290Crossref PubMed Scopus (711) Google Scholar,23Yan M. Dai T. Deak J.C. Kyriakis J.M. Zon L.I. Woodgett J.R. Templeton D.J. Nature. 1994; 372: 798-800Crossref PubMed Scopus (658) Google Scholar). To investigate the role of JNK activation in polyglutamine-expanded huntingtin-mediated apoptosis in HN33 cells, I examined the effect of co-expression of this dominant negative mutant form of SEK1 with polyglutamine-expanded huntingtin. Transient expression of either wild-type or dominant negative SEK1 alone had little effect on the proliferation and survival of HN33 cells (data not shown). Co-expression of pcDNA1 with pEBG (SEK1 vector) also did not produce any toxic effect (Fig. 3, C and 3 D, upper left panel). Co-transfection of wild-type SEK1 with pFL48HD or pFL89HD did not affect neuronal toxicity induced by mutated huntingtin (Fig. 3 C), while co-expression of dominant negative mutant SEK1, however, significantly prevented apoptotic cell death induced by the mutated huntingtin with either 48 or 89 polyglutamine repeats (Fig. 3, C and D). At 48 h after transfection, about 25–30% of cells had undergone apoptotic cell death compared with ∼75% of cells after expression of mutated huntingtin with 48 or 89 polyglutamine repeats alone (Fig. 3,C and D). These TUNEL-negative HN33 cells appeared to be viable, because cells continued to proliferate, and trypan blue staining was negative. I further examined whether the rescuing effect of dominant negative SEK1 is mediated by inhibition of the JNK activation. Co-expression of dominant negative SEK1 significantly attenuated the JNK activity induced by mutated huntingtin with either 48 or 89 polyglutamine repeats (data not shown). These results further support the conclusion that polyglutamine-expanded huntingtin activates the SEK1-JNK pathway to mediate apoptosis in HN33 cells. In the present study, I demonstrate that expression of mutated huntingtin containing 48 or 89 polyglutamine repeats activates the SEK1-JNK pathway and induces apoptosis in a hippocampal neuronal cell line. The observed neuronal toxicity is unlikely to be due to overexpression of mutated proteins, since expression of the same level of normal huntingtin with 16 polyglutamine repeats does not initiate cell death. Apparently, neuronal apoptosis induced by huntingtin is dependent on expansion of its polyglutamine repeat. Moreover, neuronal toxicity induced by mutated huntingtin with 89 polyglutamine repeats occurs slightly, but consistently, earlier than huntingtin with 48 polyglutamine repeats, further supporting the notion that neuronal apoptosis is mediated by polyglutamine repeat expansion. Since expression of mutated huntingtin alone does not induce apoptosis in 293 cells, this toxic effect may be a cell-specific event. Selective loss of neurons in different brain regions is a hallmark of HD (2Harper P.S. Huntington's Disease. W. B. Saunders, London1991Google Scholar, 4Reiner A. Albin R.L. Anderson K.D. D'Amato C. Penney J.B. Young A.B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1988; 85: 5733-5737Crossref PubMed Scopus (800) Google Scholar), and neuronal apoptosis is one of the pathological changes observed in brains of HD patients, particularly in the early stage of the disease (24Portera-Cailliau C. Hedreen J.C. Price D.L. Koliatsos V.E. J. Neurosci. 1995; 15: 3775-3787Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 25Thomas L.B. Gates D.J. Richfield E.K. O'Brien T.F. Schweitzer J.B. Steindler D.A. Exp. Neurol. 1995; 133: 265-272Crossref PubMed Scopus (210) Google Scholar). Thus, understanding of the molecular mechanism of neuronal death in HD is essential for revealing the pathogenesis of HD. My studies first demonstrate that expression of polyglutamine-expanded huntingtin leads to neuronal apoptosis. Since hippocampal neurons are targeted in HD (2Harper P.S. Huntington's Disease. W. B. Saunders, London1991Google Scholar, 4Reiner A. Albin R.L. Anderson K.D. D'Amato C. Penney J.B. Young A.B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1988; 85: 5733-5737Crossref PubMed Scopus (800) Google Scholar), my results are consistent with the major pathological feature of the disease. Moreover, the time course of neuronal toxicity generated by mutated huntingtin is clearly correlated with the length of the polyglutamine repeat as is the onset of the disease (5Andrew S.E. Goldberg Y.P. Kremer B. Håkan T. Theilmann J. Adam S. Starr E. Squitieri F. Lin B. Kalchman M.A. Graham R.K. Hayden M.P. Nat. Genet. 1993; 4: 398-403Crossref PubMed Scopus (888) Google Scholar, 6Snell R.G. MacMillan J.C. Cheadle J.P. Fenton I. Lazarou L.P. Davies P. MacDonald M.E. Gusella J.F. Harper P.S. Shaw D.J. Nat. Genet. 1993; 4: 393-397Crossref PubMed Scopus (604) Google Scholar). Activation of JNK appears to be a major factor in the apoptotic death of HN33 cells induced by polyglutamine-expanded huntingtin. Mutated huntingtin with 48 or 89 polyglutamine repeats activates JNK in HN33 cells, while normal huntingtin with 16 repeats fails to do so, suggesting that activation of JNK by huntingtin requires expansion of the polyglutamine repeat. Activation of JNK induced by mutated huntingtin takes place several hours prior to apoptotic cell death, implying that JNK activation may trigger apoptotic pathways. The JNK-c-Jun-mediated apoptosis has been reported to be sensitive to both ICE and CPP32 inhibitors (19Tapon N. Nagata K. Lamarche N. Hall A. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 1395-1404Crossref PubMed Scopus (180) Google Scholar, 26Bossy-Wetzel E. Bakiri L. Yaniv M. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 1695-1709Crossref PubMed Scopus (379) Google Scholar), mutated huntingtin-mediated apoptosis was blocked by either inhibitor. Furthermore, dominant negative SEK1 inhibits mutated huntingtin induced-activation of JNKs in HN33 cells and also attenuates apoptotic cell death, further indicating that mutated huntingtin activates the SEK1-JNK pathway to induce neuronal apoptosis in HN33 cells. Excitotoxicity is thought to contribute a final common pathway of neuronal injury in a wide range of neurodegenerative disorders including HD (7Coyle J.T. Puttfarcken P. Science. 1993; 262: 689-695Crossref PubMed Scopus (3532) Google Scholar, 27Beal M.F. Ann. Neurol. 1995; 38: 357-366Crossref PubMed Scopus (1264) Google Scholar). Administration of NMDA receptor agonists in rats causes selective loss of medium-spiny neurons in striatum that are also particularly affected in HD (8Beal M.F. Kowall N.W. Ellison D.W. Mazurek M.F. Swartz K.J. Martin J.B. Nature. 1986; 321: 168-171Crossref PubMed Scopus (1113) Google Scholar). The most intriguing data comes from gene-targeted knockout of JNK3, which renders mice resistant to neuronal excitotoxicity mediated by kainic acid receptors (12Yang D.D. Kuan C.-Y. Whitmarsh A.J. Rincon M. Zheng T.S. Davis R.J. Rakis P. Flavell R. Nature. 1997; 389: 865-869Crossref PubMed Scopus (1115) Google Scholar). Given the fact that activation of kainic acid or glutamate receptors and mutated huntingtin share selective neuronal targets, they could also utilize common cellular mediators for the induction of neuronal toxicity. JNK is one such cellular mediator for neuronal toxicity induced by both mutated huntingtin and glutamate/kainic acid receptors, since my current study and other reports (11Schwarzschild M.A. Cole R.L. Hyman S.E. J. Neurosci. 1997; 17: 3455-3466Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 12Yang D.D. Kuan C.-Y. Whitmarsh A.J. Rincon M. Zheng T.S. Davis R.J. Rakis P. Flavell R. Nature. 1997; 389: 865-869Crossref PubMed Scopus (1115) Google Scholar) show that activation of JNK is responsible for neuronal toxicity induced either by mutated huntingtin or by stimulation of glutamate/kainic acid receptors. Currently, it is unclear whether JNK activation precedes neuronal loss in HD patients. JNK activates c-Jun and AP-1 transcription factors to induce apoptosis (9Ham J. Babij C. Whitfield J. Pfarr C.M. Lallemand D. Yaniv M. Rubin L.L. Neuron. 1995; 14: 927-939Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (757) Google Scholar, 27Beal M.F. Ann. Neurol. 1995; 38: 357-366Crossref PubMed Scopus (1264) Google Scholar). Increased expression and translocation of c-Jun and NF-κB (often concomitantly activated with the JNK cascade) has been observed in several neurodegenerative diseases (28Anderson A.J. Cummings B.J. Cotman C.W. Exp. Neurol. 1994; 125: 286-295Crossref PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar, 29Hunot A. Brugg B. Ricard D. Michel P.P. Muriel M.-P. Ruberg M. Faucheux B.A. Agid Y. Hirsch E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 7531-7536Crossref PubMed Scopus (630) Google Scholar). Moreover, JNK activation is responsible for neuronal apoptosis induced by a variety of oxidative stress stimuli such as ischemia (30Herdegen T. Claret F.-X. Kallunki T. Martin-Villalba A. Winter C. Hunter T. Karin M. J. Neurosci. 1998; 18: 5124-5135Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). These data and my current study suggest that overactivation of the JNK cascade may be a common pathway of neuronal death in different neurodegenerative diseases and in acute insults. In summary, my findings show that activation of the SEK1-JNK pathway may mediate neuronal death in HD, and proteins that are involved in activation of this signaling pathway may therefore be potential drug targets for the prevention of neuronal loss in HD as well as other neurodegenerative disorders.

Sphingomyelinase (SMase) and phospholipase A2 (PLA2) have been found in the arterial wall, and, moreover, lesional LDL shows signs of hydrolysis of both sphingomyelin and phosphatidylcholine. We have now studied the effects of these two lipolytic modifications on the aggregation and fusion of LDL particles by hydrolyzing the particles with Bacillus cereus SMase or bee venom PLA2. In addition, the binding strengths of the modified LDL to human aortic proteoglycans (PG) were analyzed on an affinity column. We found that SMase induced aggregation and fusion of LDL, but PLA2 induced only aggregation of the particles. In addition, the SMase-induced aggregation and fusion of LDL was promoted by pretreatment of LDL with PLA2. Determination of the binding strengths of the hydrolyzed LDL revealed that mere lipolysis of LDL without aggregation or fusion, either by SMase or PLA2, did not affect the binding of the particles to PG. Aggregation and fusion of lipolyzed LDL particles, however, increased their strength of binding to PG.

Moreover, aggregation and fusion of LDL increased the number of apoB-100 copies and, consequently, the number of active lysine residues per aggregate or fused particle. Our present findings therefore (i) show that treatment of LDL with SMase and PLA2 generates modified LDL particles, which then bind to human aortic PG with increased strength, and (ii) suggest that SMase- and PLA2-induced aggregation and fusion of LDL are potential mechanisms leading to focal retention of extracellular lipid in the arterial wall.

In atherosclerosis, one important factor causing the retention of low density lipoprotein (LDL)1 particles within the arterial wall is their binding to intimal proteoglycans (1Williams K.J. Tabas I. Arterioscler. Thromb. Vasc. Biol. 1995; 15: 551-561Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 2Hurt-Camejo E. Olsson U. Wiklund O. Bondjers G. Camejo G. Arterioscler. Thromb. Vasc.

Indeed, complexes of apolipoprotein B-100 (apoB-100) containing lipoproteins and proteoglycans can be isolated from fatty streaks and fibrous plaques in the human aorta (3Vijayagopal P. Srinivasan S.R. Radhakrishnamurthy B. Berenson G.S. Arterioscler. Thromb. 1992; 12: 237-249Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). Since a subendothelial proteoglycan-rich layer is present in all arteries, the atherosclerotic areas have been suggested to contain proteoglycans with a unique structure that favors entrapment of LDL (4Camejo G. Fager G. Rosengren B. Hurt-Camejo E. Bondjers G. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 14131-14137Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 5Vijayagopal P. Figueroa J.E. Fontenot J.D. Glancy D.L. Atherosclerosis. 1996; 127: 195-203Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). Another possible cause of the focal accumulation of LDL-derived cholesterol is modification of the LDL in the atherosclerosis-prone intimal areas, with ensuing strengthened binding to proteoglycans. Of the potential modifications of LDL in the arterial intima, oxidation has been studied the most (6Steinberg D. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 20963-20966Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1445) Google Scholar). However, oxidation of LDL inhibits rather than augments the interaction between LDL and proteoglycans (7Öörni K. Pentikäinen M.O. Annila A. Kovanen P.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 21303-21311Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). Another potential cause of LDL modification influencing the interaction between LDL and proteoglycans is proteolysis of the apoB-100 component of LDL. In fact, treatment of LDL with mast cell chymase (8Paananen K. Kovanen P.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 2023-2031Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) or α-chymotrypsin (9Paananen K. Saarinen J. Annila A. Kovanen P.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 12257-12262Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar) increased the strength of LDL binding to proteoglycans. Treatment of LDL with these proteolytic enzymes induced fusion of the proteolyzed LDL particles (10Kokkonen J.O. Kovanen P.T. J. Biol.

After hydrolysis by either SMase or PLA2, LDL is taken up by macrophages in vitro(19Xu X.-X. Tabas I. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 24849-24858Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 20Aviram M.

However, no studies have addressed the effects of these enzymes on the direct binding of LDL to proteoglycans. In this study, we have examined the effects of hydrolysis of SM withBacillus cereus SMase and hydrolysis of PC with bee venom PLA2 on the morphology of LDL particles and on the interaction between LDL particles and human aortic proteoglycans. The distinct changes in the lipids of LDL induced by the two enzymes were found to lead to dissimilar aggregation/fusion behavior of the modified LDL particles. Despite these differences, both modifications were found to increase the binding strength of LDL to human aortic proteoglycans. Essentially fatty acid-free bovine serum albumin (BSA), ε-aminocaproic acid, PLA2 (from bee venom), immobilized PLA2 (from bee venom), and sphingomyelinase (from B. cereus) were from Sigma.t-Butoxycarbonyl-l-[3H]methionineN-hydroxysuccinimidyl ester (the 3H-labeling reagent) was from Amersham Pharmacia Biotech. Phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride was from Boehringer Mannheim. Chondroitinases ABC and AC and the unsaturated chondro-disaccharide kit for high performance liquid chromatography were from Seikagaku Kogyo. [13C]Formaldehyde (99% isotope enrichment) as a 20% solution in water was from Isotec Inc., and [14C]formaldehyde was from DuPont. NaCNBH3from Sigma was purified by recrystallization from dichloromethane before use (21Jentoft N. Dearborn D.G. Methods Enzymol. 1983; 91: 570-579Crossref PubMed Scopus (172) Google Scholar). Superose 6 HR 10/30 column and HiTrap NHS activated (1 ml) column were from Amersham Pharmacia Biotech. Bio-Gel A-5m gel filtration media was from Bio-Rad, and the 5-μm NH2(0.3 × 25 cm) column was from Spherisorb. Human LDL (d = 1.019–1.050 g/ml) was isolated from plasma of healthy volunteers by sequential ultracentrifugation in the presence of 3 mm EDTA (22Havel R.J. Eder H.A. Bragdon J.H. J. Clin. Invest. 1955; 34: 1345-1353Crossref PubMed Scopus (6449) Google Scholar, 23Radding C.M. Steinberg D. J. Clin. Invest. 1960; 39: 1560-1569Crossref PubMed Scopus (170) Google Scholar). 3H-LDL was prepared by labeling the protein component of LDL by the Bolton-Hunter procedure (24Bolton A.E. Hunter W.M. Biochem. J. 1973; 133: 529-539Crossref PubMed Scopus (2374) Google Scholar) with a 3H-labeling reagent, as described previously (25Kovanen P.T. Kokkonen J.O. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 4430-4436Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). For each experiment, labeled LDL was diluted with unlabeled LDL to give the specific radioactivities indicated in the figure legends. The amounts of LDL are expressed in terms of its protein concentration. LDL (1 mg/ml) was incubated with 95 ng/ml (50 milliunits/ml) SMase in 5 mm HEPES, 2 mmCaCl2, 5 mm MgCl2, and 140 mm NaCl, pH 7.4, or with 50 ng/ml (60 milliunits/ml) PLA2 or 16 μg/ml agarose beads containing 60 units/ml immobilized PLA2 in the absence or presence of 2% (w/v) fatty acid-free BSA in 5 mm HEPES, 5 mmCaCl2, 2 mm MgCl2, and 140 mm NaCl, pH 7.4. After incubation at 37 °C for the indicated times, lipolysis was stopped by addition of EDTA to give a final concentration of 10 mm. To separate the immobilized PLA2 from LDL, the incubation mixtures were centrifuged at 2000 × g for 5 min. The turbidity of modified LDL (250 μl) was measured at 430 nm, using a cuvette with a 1-cm light path with a Biochrom 4060 spectrophotometer (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). The degree of lipolysis with SMase was determined as the amount of phosphocholine generated (26Krug E.L. Kent C. Methods Enzymol. 1981; 72: 347-351Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar), and the degree of lipolysis with PLA2 was determined by measuring the amount of free fatty acids generated using a commercial kit (Nefa-C-kit, Wako Chemicals). For phospholipid analysis, lipid extracts of LDL (27Bligh E.G. Dyer W.J. Can. J. Biochem. Physiol. 1959; 37: 911-917Crossref PubMed Scopus (41848) Google Scholar) were chromatographed by TLC using chloroform/methanol/acetic acid/H2O (50:30:8:3.5, v/v). Individual phospholipid subclasses were visualized by dipping the TLC plate into a solution containing 3% copper acetate (w/v) and 8% phosphoric acid (w/v) and then heating the plate at 150 °C for 20 min. The phospholipids were detected with an automatic plate scanner (CAMAG TLC Scanner 3). Protein was determined by the method of Lowry et al. (28Lowry O.H. Rosebrough N.J. Farr A.L. Randall R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1951; 193: 265-275Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), with bovine serum albumin as standard. The degree of aggregation and/or fusion of lipolyzed 3H-LDL was determined by gel filtration chromatography. Aliquots corresponding to 100–400 μg of LDL in 100–400 μl were run through a Superose 6 HR 10/30 column in 5 mm Tris-HCl, 1 mm EDTA, and 150 mmNaCl, pH 7.4. The flow rate was 0.5 ml/min, and 500–μl fractions were collected. The degree of aggregation/fusion of the3H-LDL (eluting in the void volume of the column) was determined by calculating the ratio of the radioactivity in fractions 14–19 (void volume peak) to the total eluted radioactivity (fractions 14–30). The degree of aggregation/fusion is expressed in percent ((radioactivity in void volume/total eluted radioactivity) × 100). Proteoglycans from intima media of human aortas were obtained at autopsy within 24 h of accidental death and were prepared essentially by the method of Hurt-Camejo et al.(29Hurt-Camejo E. Camejo G. Rosengren B. López F. Wiklund O. Bondjers G. J. Lipid Res. 1990; 31: 1397-1398Abstract Full Text PDF Google Scholar) as described previously (7Öörni K. Pentikäinen M.O. Annila A. Kovanen P.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 21303-21311Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). The disaccharide composition of the proteoglycans was analyzed after treatment with chondroitinase ABC and AC by high performance liquid chromatography using a 5-μm NH2 column (30Macek J. Krajickova J. Adam M. J. Chromatogr. 1987; 414: 156-160Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). The proteoglycan preparation used here contained 36% of chondroitin 6-sulfate, 52% of chondroitin 4-sulfate, and 12% of dermatan sulfate. Glycosaminoglycans were determined by the method of Bartold and Page (31Bartold P.M. Page R.C. Anal. Biochem. 1985; 150: 320-324Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar), and the amounts of the proteoglycans are expressed in terms of their glycosaminoglycan content. Human arterial proteoglycans were coupled to an NHS-activated HiTrap column (1 ml) according to the manufacturer's instructions. For this purpose, 1.0 mg of proteoglycans in 0.2m NaHCO3 and 0.5 m NaCl, pH 8.3, were coupled to the column at 25 °C for 2 h. The column was then blocked with 0.5 m ethanolamine, pH 8.3, containing 0.5 m NaCl. Under these conditions, 0.7 mg of the proteoglycans was found to be coupled to the column. The columns were equilibrated with buffer A (5 mm HEPES, 2 mmCaCl2, and 2 mm MgCl2, pH 7.4) before use. LDL was treated with SMase or PLA2 as described above and separated into aggregated/fused and native-sized monomeric lipolyzed particles by gel filtration chromatography on a Superose 6 HR 10/30 gel filtration column. Aliquots (30 μl) of the incubation mixtures and the peak fractions were analyzed on a HiTrap proteoglycan column by eluting with a linear NaCl gradient (0–250 mmNaCl in 10 min) in buffer A. Chromatography was performed at a flow rate of 1.0 ml/min. Elution was monitored by UV absorbance at 280 nm and by collecting 500–μl fractions and determining their radioactivity. The chromatographic apparatus was the Smart system (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). LDL (2 mg) was lipolyzed for 12 h with SMase or PLA2 as described above, and after lipolysis, the lysine residues of apoB-100 were modified by treatment of 1 mg of the lipolyzed LDL samples with acetic anhydride (32Basu S.K. Goldstein J.L. Anderson R.G.W. Brown M.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1976; 73: 3178-3182Crossref PubMed Scopus (818) Google Scholar). LDL (20–40 mg, 2 mg/ml) was lipolyzed with PLA2 or SMase as described above. After incubation at 37 °C for 8 h, the samples were applied to a gel filtration column (Bio-Gel A-5m (2.6 × 70 cm) equilibrated in saline (150 mm NaCl, 1 mmEDTA, pH 7.4) to separate the aggregated/fused particles from the monomers. For NMR analysis, the amino groups of lysine residues (lysine-NH3) in the samples and, as a control, in untreated LDL, were reductively methylated with [13C]formaldehyde to produce lysine-NH(13CH3)2 as described by Lund-Katz et al. (33Lund-Katz S. Ibdah J.A. Letizia J.Y. Thomas M.T. Phillips M.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 13831-13838Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). First, 0.2 mNaCNBH3 was added to untreated LDL, monomeric PLA2-lipolyzed LDL, aggregated PLA2-lipolyzed LDL, and aggregated/fused SMase-lipolyzed LDL (1 mg/ml in saline) to give a final concentration of 20 mm. Then [13C]formaldehyde (6.5 × 10−6 mol/mg LDL) was added to the samples, and these were incubated at 4 °C for 18 h. The reactions were stopped by extensive dialysis against saline at 4 °C. The labeled LDL solutions were concentrated in Amicon 50 concentrators with a 50-kDa cut-off membrane. The [13C]formaldehyde was doped with a trace of [14C]]formaldehyde to give a known specific radioactivity. The degree of reductive methylation was calculated by measuring the amount of 14C radioactivity incorporated into the lysine residues of apoB-100. Broad band proton-decoupled13C NMR-free induction decay signals were measured from LDL samples comprising 2.1–20 mg of protein/ml in a solution containing 150 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, and 0.02% NaN3, pH 7.4, and 10% of D2O for the spectrometer field-lock. The 13C NMR data were obtained at 37 ± 0.5 °C. In all experiments, the relaxation delay was 5 s, and pulse length was 8 μs (34Lund-Katz S. Innerarity T.L. Arnold K.S. Curtiss L.K. Phillips M.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 2701-2704Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The spectral width of 200 ppm and the free induction decay was recorded for 0.273 s. The total acquisition time varied from 6 to 16 h, depending on the LDL concentration of the sample. Proton decoupling was performed with a GARP-1 sequence (35Shaka A.J. Barker P. Freeman R. J. Magn. Reson. 1985; 64: 547-552Google Scholar). Each measured free induction decay was zero-filled twice prior to the Fourier transformation to the frequency domain spectrum. No apodization was used. The normal and active lysines peak at 42.8 and 43.2 ppm, respectively, and the cholesterol backbone 13C13 peaks at 42.2 ppm were subjected to line shape fitting analysis to accurately resolve the areas of these partly overlapping peaks. Each peak was modeled with a Lorenzian basis line shape, but for each spectrum the shape was corrected for a Gaussian contribution. In addition, the phase and the base-line level were adjusted during the analysis. The total line shape option of the PERCH (PEak reseaRCH) software was used (36Laatikainen R. Niemitz M. Malaisse W.J. Biesemans M. Willem R. Magn. Reson. Med. 1996; 36: 359-365Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar). The iterative analysis resulted in a good correspondence with the experimental resonances in every case and thus the model parameters obtained could be used to derive the areas of the normal and active lysine peaks. Samples (3 μl) were dried on carbon-coated grids, after which 3 μl of 1% potassium phosphotungstate, pH 7.4, was also dried on the grids (37Forte T. Nichols A.V. Adv. Lipid Res. 1972; 10: 1-42Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The negatively stained samples were viewed and photographed in a JEOL 1200EX electron microscope at the Institute for Biotechnology, Department of Electron Microscopy, Helsinki, Finland. The diameters of 200 randomly selected lipoprotein particles were measured from the electron micrographs. To study the effect of SM and PC hydrolysis of LDL particles, 1 mg/ml 3H-LDL was first treated with 95 ng/ml (50 milliunits/ml) SMase for 1 h at 37 °C or with 50 ng/ml (60 milliunits/ml) PLA2 in the presence of 2% BSA for 1 h at 37 °C. The degrees of lipolysis produced by SMase and PLA2 were determined from the respective amounts of phosphocholine and free fatty acid molecules formed. After incubation for 1 h, 0.28 nmol of SM/μg LDL and 0.45 nmol of PC/μg LDL were hydrolyzed. The aggregation and fusion of the LDL particles were determined from the turbidity of the lipolyzed samples, as measured by their absorbance at 430 nm. The absorbance of the SMase-treated LDL was markedly increased, whereas that of PLA2-treated LDL was not. The absorbances of native LDL, SMase-treated LDL, and PLA2-treated LDL were 0.325, 0.695, and 0.363, respectively. The increased turbidity of the SMase-treated LDL reflects aggregation/fusion of LDL and is in accord with previously reported results (19Xu X.-X. Tabas I. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 24849-24858Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The degree of aggregation/fusion of the lipolyzed LDL samples was determined on a Superose 6 HR 10/30 gel filtration column, whose exclusion limit is 4 × 106. Native LDL eluted from the gel filtration column in a single peak at 11 ml (Fig. 1 A). Surprisingly, both SMase- and PLA2-treated LDL eluted from the column in two peaks (Figs. 1, B and C, respectively); peak I eluted at the void volume of the column and peak II at a position corresponding to the elution volume of native LDL. The degree of aggregation/fusion of the two lipolyzed samples was quantified by expressing the amount of radioactivity eluting at the void volume of the column (peak I) in percent of the total eluted radioactivity. These calculations showed that 45% of the SMase-treated LDL and 44% of the PLA2-treated LDL were aggregated/fused. To analyze the morphology of the SMase- and PLA2-treated LDL particles, native LDL and aliquots of the peak fractions from the gel filtration chromatography were analyzed with electron microscopy after negative staining of the particles. The size distribution of 200 particles was determined from the electron micrographs (Fig. 2, A—E). Native LDL had a mean diameter of 21.1 nm (±1.4 nm, median 21.4 nm). The SMase-treated particles eluting in peak II resembled native LDL, and the PLA2-treated particles eluting in peak II were slightly smaller than native LDL. Their mean diameters were 20.7 (±2.0 nm, median 21.4 nm) and 19.5 (±2.2 nm, median 20.0 nm), respectively. The mean diameter of the SMase-treated particles eluting in peak I was 24.7 nm (±6.2 nm, median 21.4 nm). About 35% of the particles were larger than any of the particles in native LDL; the largest particles had diameters of 47 nm. In contrast, the PLA2-treated particles eluting in peak I resembled native LDL; their mean diameter was 20.4 nm (±2.4 nm, median 21.4 nm). Since elution of the native-sized LDL particles from the gel filtration column at the void volume reveals particle aggregation, we conclude that PLA2 induced aggregation of LDL, whereas SMase induced both aggregation and fusion of the lipolyzed LDL particles. We next studied the effect of the degree of LDL lipolysis on the degree of aggregation and fusion. For this purpose, 3H-LDL was incubated with 50 milliunits/ml SMase or with 60 milliunits/ml of PLA2 and 2% BSA for various times. At the indicated time points, lipolysis was stopped with EDTA, and the degrees of lipolysis (Fig. 3 A) and aggregation/fusion (Fig. 3 B) were determined. Under the above conditions, lipolysis of LDL with both SMase and PLA2reached a maximum after incubation for 2 h, when 0.51 nmol of PC or 0.36 nmol of SM/μg LDL was hydrolyzed. The degree of aggregation/fusion was determined with gel filtration chromatography on a Superose 6 HR 10/30 column. SMase induced substantial aggregation/fusion of LDL after 1 h, when the degree of lipolysis was 85% of the maximum. In a parallel experiment, the degree of SM hydrolysis was found to be different in the two particle populations; 97% of SM in the aggregated/fused particles and 74% of SM in the monomeric particles were degraded. With prolonged incubation, the SMase-induced aggregation/fusion continued, and after incubation for 8 h, 90% of the radioactivity eluted in the void volume of the gel filtration column. After incubation for 24 h, the recovery of SMase-treated LDL from the gel filtration column was less than 50%, and the degree of aggregation/fusion could not be determined accurately. About 50% of the particles in this sample formed large aggregates that could be sedimented by centrifugation at 14,000 ×g, and electron microscopic examination of the sample revealed that about 50% of the particles were enlarged (not shown). PLA2-induced aggregation of LDL particles reached a maximum of about 40% after incubation for as little as 2 h, the degree of lipolysis then being maximal. Even after incubation for 24 h, more than half of the PLA2-treated LDL remained monomeric. Recovery of the sample from the gel filtration column was over 85%, and less than 10% of the radioactivity could be sedimented by centrifugation at 14 000 × g, indicating formation of small aggregates. The particles, whether eluting in peak I (void volume) or peak II, and whether the incubation time was 1 h or 24 h, were slightly smaller than native LDL (not shown). Phospholipid analysis of the peak fractions showed that, after incubation for 24 h, all of the PC in both the aggregated and monomeric PLA2-treated particles was hydrolyzed. When the above experiments were repeated with LDL from various donors, it was found that the degree of PLA2-induced aggregation varied between 16 and 44%. SMase-induced aggregation, on the other hand, always led to aggregation/fusion of virtually all of the lipolyzed LDL particles. Taken together, SMase induced substantial aggregation/fusion of LDL only after most of the SM molecules on the particles were hydrolyzed, but once this had taken place, all of the SMase-treated particles became aggregated and/or fused. In contrast, PLA2-induced aggregation of LDL began without any delay, but, even after prolonged incubation times, only a fraction of the PLA2-treated particles became aggregated without ensuing particle fusion. Recently, human secretory SMase (s-SMase), secreted by arterial cells, was shown to be unable to act on native LDL at neutral pH (15Schissel S.L. Jiang X. Tweedie-Hardman J. Jeong T. Camejo E.H. Najib J. Rapp J.H. Williams K.J. Tabas I. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 2738-2746Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (273) Google Scholar). In contrast, LDL pretreated with human secretory PLA2 was hydrolyzed by the enzyme even at neutral pH. In preliminary experiments, we found that when LDL is treated with PLA2 in the absence of albumin, the lipolytic products of PLA2activity accumulate in the LDL particles; the negatively charged free fatty acids increase the net negative charge of the PLA2-treated particles, and they do not aggregate (not shown). However, intimal fluid contains about 2% albumin (38Smith E. Eur. Heart. J. 1990; 11 Suppl. E: 72-81Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), and if LDL (1 mg/ml) is treated with PLA2 in the presence of 2% BSA, the net charge of the particles is not increased, indicating that the negatively charged free fatty acids have been released from the particles (not shown). Therefore, to study the effect of PLA2 pretreatment on SMase-induced aggregation/fusion of LDL, we treated LDL with immobilized PLA2 in the presence and absence of 2% BSA for various times. At the indicated time points, the PLA2 beads were sedimented and removed, and 50 milliunits/ml SMase was added to the supernatants. After incubation for 30 min with SMase, EDTA was added to stop the lipolysis, and incubation was continued for an additional 4 h at 37 °C. The turbidity of the samples at 430 nm and the degrees of PC and SM hydrolysis were then determined. In all the samples, the degree of SM hydrolysis was similar (130 nmol ± 22 nmol/μg LDL), indicating that pretreatment of LDL with PLA2 did not affect the activity of SMase on LDL. Treatment of LDL with PLA2 in either the presence or absence of BSA did not change the turbidity of the samples, even though treatment for 30 min in the presence of albumin induced aggregation of about 20% of the LDL particles. In the absence of albumin, PLA2 pretreatment decreased the degree of SMase-induced aggregation/fusion of LDL particles (Fig. 4, white columns). In contrast, in the presence of albumin PLA2 pretreatment promoted SMase-induced aggregation/fusion of LDL; the higher the degree of PC hydrolysis, the higher was the turbidity of the SMase-treated LDL particles (Fig. 4, black columns).

https://openalex.org/W1975276753,"Elevated lipogenesis is a key determinant of exaggerated fat deposition in adipose tissue of obese Zucker rats. We previously delineated a region in the fatty-acid synthase promoter, which was responsible for obesity-related overexpression of the fatty-acid synthase (FAS) gene, by negatively regulating the activity of the downstream promoter in lean but not obese rat fat cells. The present study aimed to identify the transcriptional factors acting on this target region. First, functional analysis of mutated FAS promoter constructs in transiently transfected lean and obese rat adipocytes showed that the activity of the obesity-related region relied on the presence of a transcriptionally inactive sterol regulatory element at −150, which counteracted activation through the downstream E-box. Adenovirus-mediated overexpression of a dominant negative form of adipocyte determination and differentiation factor 1 (ADD1) was used to neutralize endogenous ADD1/ sterol regulatory element-binding protein (SREBP) transcriptional activity in fat cells, by producing inactive dimers unable to bind target DNA. With this system, we observed that overexpression of FAS in obese rat adipocytes was ADD1/SREBP-dependent. SREBP isoforms expression was assessed in lean and obese rat fat cells and showed no differences in the level of ADD1/SREBP1 mRNA. In addition, equivalent amounts of immunoreactive ADD1/SREBP1 were found in nuclear extracts from lean and obese rat fat cells. In contrast, immunoreactive SREBP2, which was very low in nuclear extracts from lean rats, was induced in obese rat fat cells. Finally, using <i>in vitro</i>binding studies, we showed that SREBP2 was able to displace ADD1/SREBP1 binding from the sterol regulatory element (SRE) site. Thus, we propose a mechanism for obesity-related overexpression of FAS gene in rat adipocyte. ADD1/SREBP1-activated transcription proceeding from the E-box motif is counterbalanced by a negative SRE site acting by limiting the availability of ADD1/SREBP1 in normal fat cells. The negative effect of this site is abolished in obese rat adipocyte nuclei where SREBP2 is induced and can substitute for ADD1/SREBP1 binding to the inactive SRE. These results provide evidence for the implication of SREBPs in the dysregulation of adipocyte metabolism characteristic of the obese state."
https://openalex.org/W2105880282,"NapC is a member of a family of bacterial membrane-anchored tetra-heme c-type cytochromes that participate in a number of respiratory electron transport pathways.

Mediated redox potentiometry and characterization by UV-visible, magnetic circular dichroism, and electron paramagnetic resonance spectroscopies demonstrates that soluble NapC contains four low spin hemes, each with bis-histidine axial ligation and with midpoint reduction potentials of −56, −181, −207, and −235 mV.

Many bacterial periplasmic oxidoreductases have been identified that couple respiratory electron acceptors or electron donors to energy conserving electron transport pathways (1Parsonage D. Ferguson S.J. FEBS Lett. 1983; 153: 108-112Crossref Scopus (23) Google Scholar). Often these enzymes need to interact with a redox protein that can mediate electron transport from, or to, the membrane QH2/Q1 pool (2Parsonage D. Greenfield A.J. Ferguson S.J. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1985; 807: 81-95Crossref Scopus (49) Google Scholar). In some cases quinol oxidation can be facilitated by operation of the cytochrome bc 1 complex, for example in electron transport to the periplasmic nitrite and nitrous oxide reductases of the denitrifying bacterium Paracoccus denitrificans (3Nicholls D.G.

However, the cytochrome bc 1 complex is not ubiquitous in bacteria and when present is not always involved in electron transport to all the periplasmic enzymes. For example, electron transport to the periplasmic nitrate reductase of P. denitrificans proceeds independently of the cytochromebc 1 complex (4Berks B.C. Ferguson S.J. Moir J.W.B. Richardson D.J.

Over the last 5 years, sequencing studies have identified a family of periplasmicc-type cytochromes, the NapC/NirT family, which appear to provide the major, cytochrome bc 1-independent, route for electron transfer between the quinol pool and water-soluble periplasmic oxidoreductases. Such cytochromes are phylogenetically more widely distributed than the cytochrome bc 1complex among the Proteobacteria (6Berks B.C. Richardson D.J. Reilly A. Willis A.C. Ferguson S.J. Biochem. J. 1995; 309: 983-992Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar). However, no member of this important cytochrome family has been purified or characterized spectroscopically. Analysis of the primary structure derived from DNA sequences suggests that a common feature of the NapC/NirT-like cytochromes is the presence of a N-terminal transmembrane α-helical anchor that binds a tetra-heme globular domain to the periplasmic face of the plasma membrane (6Berks B.C. Richardson D.J. Reilly A. Willis A.C. Ferguson S.J. Biochem. J. 1995; 309: 983-992Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar). Some members of the family have an additional C-terminal extension that is predicted to bind a fifth heme (7Méjean V. Iobbi-Nivol C. Lepelletier M. Giordano G. Chippaux M. Pascal M.-C. Mol. Microbiol. 1994; 11: 1169-1179Crossref PubMed Scopus (214) Google Scholar). The nirT gene product was the first member of the NapC/NirT family of membrane-anchored multiheme c-type cytochromes to be identified. nirT clusters with the nirS gene encoding the periplasmic cytochrome cd 1 nitrite reductase of Pseudomonas stutzeri. Disruption of this gene results in the loss of the ability of the bacterium to reduce nitrite using endogenous electron donors (8Jüngst A. Wakabayashi S. Matsubara H. Zumft W.G. FEBS Lett. 1991; 279: 205-209Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar). The napC gene encoding a homologue of NirT has since been identified in nap gene clusters that contain the napA gene for the catalytic subunit of the periplasmic nitrate reductase of Paracoccus denitrificans, Alcaligenes eutrophus, Rhodobacter sphaeroides, Hemophilus influenzae (6Berks B.C.

Disruption of thenapC gene in R. sphaeroides results in the loss of physiological electron transport to the nitrate reductase (10Reyes F. Roldán M.D. Klipp W. Castillo F Moreno-Vivián C. Mol.

InShewanella putrefaciens disruption of the cymAgene, encoding another NapC/NirT homologue, results in the pleiotropic loss of nitrate, fumarate, and iron(III) reduction (12Myers C.R. Myers J.M. J.

ThetorC genes of E. coli and H. influenzae, the dmsC gene of R. sphaeroides, and the dorC gene of Rhodobacter capsulatusencode penta-heme members of the NapC/NirT family that are likely to be involved in electron transfer to the periplasmic trimethylamineN-oxide and dimethyl sulfoxide (Me2SO) reductases (7Méjean V.

Taken together, this combination of genetic evidence strongly implicates the members of the NapC/NirT family in electron transfer from quinols to periplasmic reductases. In addition to participating in quinol oxidation some members of the NapC/NirT family may also participate in quinone reduction. For example, thecycB gene of Nitrosomonas europaea encodes a NapC/NirT homologue and is clustered with genes encoding the hydroxylamine-cytochrome c oxidoreductase (15Bergmann D.J. Arciero D.M. Hooper A.B. J. Bacteriol. 1994; 176: 3148-3153Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Electron transport from hydroxylamine to the quinone pool is a prerequisite for lithoautotrophic growth using ammonia as electron donor. The participation of members of the NirT family in a wide range of periplasmic electron transfer systems in a phylogenetically diverse range of bacteria make the characterization of this protein of central importance to understanding a number of QH2/Q-linked periplasmic electron transfer systems. In this study, we have developed an expression system for the heme-containing domain of NapC from the periplasmic nitrate reductase of P. denitrificans. This has provided a water-soluble form of NapC that can be easily purified and concentrated to the levels required for magneto-optical spectroscopies and has allowed the first spectroscopic characterization of a member of the NapC/NirT family. Bacterial strains and plasmids used and constructed in this work are listed in Table I. E. coli was routinely grown at 37 °C on LB medium (16Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T.

The primers were: 5′- CCG ACC TTA AGT GGT TAT GGC TC-3′ (napC 4672/4695 bp) and 3′- CGA TCC CAG ACG TCC CCG CGG-5′ (napC 5227/5247 bp). The 575-bp polymerase chain reaction product was cloned into EcoRI-PstI cut pLITMUS 38 to generate pLITC. A 328-bp SalI-EcoRI fragment from pKPD1, which contained the promoter and the DNA encoding the signal peptide and the first 12 amino acids of the mature CycA (cytochrome c 550) protein of P. denitrificans, was ligated into pLITC to generate pLITCsol, which now contained a 903-bp DNA fragment encoding a CycA-NapC fusion protein. This was then cloned into pKK223 as aSalI-PstI fragment (pKKCsol) and then into the broad host range vector pLA2917, previously digested with the restriction enzymes BglI/HindIII, as aBamHI-HindIII fragment (Fig. 1). This construct (pLACsol) was transferred by conjugation from the donor strain DH5α of E. coli to the recipient strains 1222 or C010 of P. denitrificans. The helper strain pRK2013 of E. colialso was required. The transconjugants were selected on minimal media plates containing rifampicin and tetracycline (P. denitrificans 1222) or rifampicin, tetracycline, and kanamycin (P. denitrificans C010). Periplasmic fractions were prepared from 100-liter batch cultures of P. denitrificans C010/pLACsol growing aerobically in LB media. The cells were harvested (A610 ∼ 0.9) by cross-flow ultrafiltration followed by centrifugation at 40,000 × g and 4 °C for 20 min. The periplasmic extract was prepared as described previously (5Berks B.C. Richardson D.J. Robinson C. Reilly A. Aplin R.T. Ferguson S.J. Eur. J. Biochem. 1994; 220: 117-124Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar). Periplasmic fractions were chromatographed on a DEAE-CL6B anion exchange chromatography column (50 mm inside diameter and 30 cm in length) developed using 100 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, with a gradient of sodium chloride (0–300 mm). The 24-kDa heme staining NapC band eluted at 300 mm NaCl but co-eluted with a 12-kDa heme-staining band, the identity of which was not further investigated. The 24-kDa NapC cytochrome could be separated from the 12-kDa cytochrome by phenyl-Sepharose chromatography (26 mm inside diameter and 40 cm in length). The fractions containing NapC were brought to 30% saturation with ammonium sulfate and loaded onto the phenyl-Sepharose column, which was developed using a 100 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, dual gradient of ammonium sulfate (30–0%) and ethylene glycol (0–25%) v/v. Most of the bound proteins eluted in this first step, but the 12- and 24-kDa cytochromes remained bound. The 12-kDa cytochrome was subsequently eluted when a second gradient of ethylene glycol (25–60%) was applied. The 24-kDa NapC was eluted when the column was finally perfused with 70% ethylene glycol. The protein was estimated using the bicinchoninic acid method (18Smith P.K. Krohn R.I. Hermanson G.T. Mallia A.K. Gartner F.H. Provenzano M.D. Fujimoto E.K. Goeke N.M. Olson B.J. Klenk D.C. Anal. Biochem. 1985; 150: 76-85Crossref PubMed Scopus (18590) Google Scholar) using bovine serum albumin Cohn fraction V as a standard. The proteins were stained with Coomassie Brilliant Blue R250. The stain for heme-linked peroxidase activity, which is specific for c-type cytochromes, was performed as described previously (19Thomas P.E. Ryan D. Levin W. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 75: 168-176Crossref PubMed Scopus (896) Google Scholar). Absorption spectra were collected using an Aminco SLM DW2000 spectrophotometer. The UV-visible spectra and redox titration of soluble NapC were carried out at 25 °C in 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, and 100 mm NaCl. Mediated redox potentiometry was performed as described (20Dutton P.L. Methods Enzymol. 1978; 54: 411-435Crossref PubMed Scopus (729) Google Scholar). Dithionite and ferricyanide were used as reductant and oxidant, respectively. Redox mediators were phenazine methosulfate, phenazine ethosulfate, diaminodurene, 4-hydroxynapthoquinone, 5-anthraquinone 2-sulfonate, 6-anthraquinone 2,6-disulfonate, and benzylviologen (at a final concentration of 20 μm). Quinhydrone was used as a redox standard (E m,7.0 = +295 mV). All potentials quoted are with respect to the normal hydrogen electrode. The MCD and EPR spectra were carried out in 20 mm TAPS, pH 8.0, and 100 mm NaCl. MCD spectra were measured using a split-coil superconducting solenoid, type SM-4 (Oxford Instruments), capable of generating a maximum magnetic field of 5 T and spectropolarimeters JASCO J-500D and J-730 for the wavelength ranges 240–100 and 800–2000 nm, respectively. EPR spectra were recorded using an ER-200D X-band spectrometer (Bruker Spectrospin) interfaced to an ESP1600 computer and fitted with a liquid-helium flow cryostat (ESR-9; Oxford Instruments). A strategy for expressing a soluble form of NapC was designed (Fig. 1). P. denitrificans was used to express NapC instead of E. coli, because E. coli has a very limited capacity for synthesis of c-type cytochromes and efforts to express NapC in this bacterium failed. The protein produced must be postranslationally modified by covalent attachment of four hemes, and this occurs after export of the polypeptide into the periplasmic compartment. Thus, having removed the DNA encoding the N-terminal membrane anchor region to construct a napC gene encoding a soluble form of NapC (pLITC), it was necessary to introduce a DNA fragment coding for a signal peptide to direct export to the periplasm. The DNA region encoding the CycA (cytochrome c 550) P. dentrificans signal peptide and the first 12 amino acids of this cytochrome were used in the gene fusion that was then expressed under the control of the cycA promoter (pLACsol; Fig. 1). ThecycA promoter and signal peptide were used because cytochrome c 550 is expressed at high levels under a variety of growth conditions and has been previously shown to direct efficient export of passenger mono-heme c-type cytochromes (21Sambongi Y. Stoll R. Ferguson S.J. Mol. Microbiol. 1996; 19: 1193-1204Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). Periplasmic extracts were prepared from P. denitrificans1222 carrying pLACsol. The cells were grown under anaerobic denitrifying conditions, with succinate as carbon substrate and nitrate as electron acceptor, and periplasmic fractions examined by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (Fig. 2 A). Comparison of heme-stained gels revealed the presence of a 24-kDa c-type cytochrome that was absent from the parent strain (Fig. 2 A, lanes 1 and 2). The calculated molecular mass of the mature NapC-soluble protein with the leader sequence cleaved is 22,035 Da, rising to 24,493 Da if the expected four heme groups are covalently bound. Thus, the presence of a 24-kDa heme-staining protein in periplasmic fractions of P. denitrificans 1222/pLACsol is strong evidence for successful expression of a soluble form of NapC. The 24-kDa heme staining band corresponding to NapC could also be resolved in periplasmic extracts of P. denitrificans C010/pLACsol (Fig. 2 A, lane 4), which carries acycA::km insertion resulting in the loss of the cytochrome c 550 heme-staining band at 17 kDa on the SDS-polyacrylamide gels (Fig. 2 A, lanes 3 and 4). Indeed, the NapC-soluble heme staining band was more intense in periplasmic extracts from P. denitrificans C010/pLACsol compared withP. denitrificans 1222/pLACsol. Moreover, the absence of cytochrome c 550 aided purification of the NapC, so the strain C010/pLACsol of P. denitrificans was selected for further analysis. The highest levels of expression of NapC were observed in periplasmic extracts prepared from cells grown aerobically in LB media (Fig. 2 B, lane 2). Much lower levels of expression of this protein were observed in cells grown aerobically in minimal media with succinate as carbon source (Fig. 2 B, lane 1) or grown anaerobically in LB media (Fig. 2 B, lane 3). Growth in LB media offered the best yield combined with an easy preparation of the batch cultures and purification, so this medium was selected for purification of the enzyme, which was performed using DEAE-Sepharose anion exchange and phenyl-Sepharose hydrophobic chromatographies. The purified NapC (Fig. 2 C) was stable at 4 °C at pH 8 (Tris-HCl or TAPS) provided that the sodium chloride concentration was maintained at 100 mm or that the ethylene glycol was maintained at 70% (v/v). The yield was 5 mg of NapC/100 liters of culture. The UV-visible absorption spectrum of air-oxidized (Fig. 3 A) and ferricyanide-oxidized (Fig. 4, inset, top) NapC showed a Soret peak at 406.5 nm with an extinction co-efficient of 434 mm−1 cm−1. This wavelength, the bandshape of the α, β region (500–600 nm), and the absence of bands in the 630–650 nm region suggest that the hemes are in the low spin state. The Soret intensity is consistent with the presence of four such species. The NapC hemes could be reduced by dithionite but not by ascorbate (E m,7.0 = +80 mV), even in the presence of the mediators tetramethyl-p-phenylenediamine or phenazine methosulfate. Absorption maxima at 416, 525, and 551 nm were observed in the dithionite reduced form (Fig. 4, inset, bottom).Figure 4Redox titration of NapC. Inset, visible absorption spectra of NapC. The ferricyanide-oxidized spectrum (top) and dithionite-reduced spectrum (bottom) are shown. Main panel, mediated potentiometric titration of the four hemes of NapC was followed by monitoring the absorption changes of the typical c-type cytochrome α band at 551 nm. These absorption values were modified by subtracting the absorbance at 563 nm (isosbestic point). The curve shows a best fit with four n = 1 Nernstian components, each given equal weighting. The protein concentration was 10 μm.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) The room temperature MCD spectrum of air-oxidized NapC (Fig. 3 B) could be assigned unambiguously to ferric heme; none of the characteristic signatures of ferrous heme were observed. Low spin ferric MCD bands dominate those of high spin throughout the 300–600 nm region (22Cheesman M.R. Greenwood C. Thomson A.J. Adv. Inorg. Chem. 1991; 36: 201-255Crossref Scopus (131) Google Scholar). This is especially so for the Soret region (∼400 nm), where a single low spin heme gives rise to a derivative shaped band with a peak-to-trough intensity of approximately 150m−1 cm−1 T−1. The MCD Soret feature of NapC (Fig. 3 B) had an intensity of 573m−1 cm−1 T−1, implying the presence of four low spin ferric hemes. The MCD for the α, β bands were also consistent with this interpretation. All the bands between 300 and 600 nm, arise from π-π* transitions of the porphyrin but are sensitive to the spin-state of the iron (22Cheesman M.R. Greenwood C. Thomson A.J. Adv. Inorg. Chem. 1991; 36: 201-255Crossref Scopus (131) Google Scholar). At wavelengths longer than 600 nm, CT bands (largely porphyrin → ferric) are observed, one for low spin ferric heme and two for the high spin state (23Braterman P.S. Davies R.C. Williams R.J.P. Adv. Chem. Phys. 1964; 7: 359-407Google Scholar, 24Cheng J.C. Osborne G.A. Stephens P.J. Eaton W.A. Nature. 1973; 241: 193-194Crossref Scopus (45) Google Scholar). The first of the high spin CT bands often appears in the absorption spectrum as a shoulder at ∼630 nm, and its observation flags the presence of this spin-state. However, its apparent absence can be due to overlap from adjacent and more intense α, β bands, and the transition is more reliably located in the MCD spectrum, where it gives rise to a derivative shaped feature. The MCD spectrum of NapC showed no trace of this band, implying that there were no significant levels of high spin heme. The CT band for low spin ferric heme, which occurs in the near-infrared region (NIR) (800–2000 nm), is rarely detectable by absorption spectroscopy but is also readily located by MCD and the peak wavelength is diagnostic of the heme ligands (22Cheesman M.R. Greenwood C. Thomson A.J. Adv. Inorg. Chem. 1991; 36: 201-255Crossref Scopus (131) Google Scholar, 25Gadsby P.M.A. Thomson A.J. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1990; 112: 5003-5011Crossref Scopus (144) Google Scholar). The NIR-MCD of NapC revealed a positive band at 1490 nm with side structure to higher energy (Fig. 3 C). This band-form is characteristic of the low spin CT band and the wavelength is typical forbis-histidine ligation (25Gadsby P.M.A. Thomson A.J. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1990; 112: 5003-5011Crossref Scopus (144) Google Scholar). However, examples of both histidine-amine (26Gadsby P.M.A. Peterson J. Foote N. Greenwood C. Thomson A.J. Biochem.

Acta. 1985; 829: 83-96Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar) co-ordination are known, and these give CT bands at similar wavelengths. Met-His− can be ruled out in this case since the co-ordination of sulfur to low spin ferric heme iron, either as methionine or cysteine, always gives rise to additional ligand → Fe(III) CT MCD bands in the 650–750 nm region (29Eaton W.A. Hochstrasser R.M. J. Chem. Phys. 1967; 46: 2533-2539Crossref PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar, 30Cheesman M.R. Kadir F.H.A. Al-Basseet J. Al-Massad F. Farrar J. Greenwood C. Thomson A.J. Moore G.R.

Furthermore, EPR analysis revealed a typical low spin ferric heme spectrum with features atg z = 2.96, g y = 2.28,g x = 1.5 (data not shown). These g values are characteristic of heme with two histidine ligands orientated with parallel planes (32Walker F.A. Huynh B.H. Scheidt W.R. Osvath S. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1986; 108: 5288-5297Crossref Scopus (304) Google Scholar) and rule out the presence of histidine-amine co-ordination, where the g values are substantially different, i.e. g z = 3.3–3.55,g y = 1.8–2.05 (26Gadsby P.M.A. Peterson J.

J. 1988; 246: 571-577Crossref Scopus (62) Google Scholar). Mediated potentiometric titrations of P. denitrificans NapC monitored spectroscopically at the α-band maximum at 551 nm could only be satisfactorily fitted with four n = 1 Nerstian components (Fig. 4, main panel). The titer was fully reversible in both oxidative and reductive directions. The best fit was obtained when it was assumed that all the hemes contributed equally to the absorption amplitude of the fully reduced sample. The estimated midpoint potentials (pH 7.0) of the four hemes were −56, −181, −207, and −235 mV. These potentials are consistent with the spectral evidence for bis-His-ligated hemes, which tend to have mid-point potentials in the range of −400 to 0 mV, whereas the redox potentials of His-Met ligated hemes tend to lie in the range of 0 to +400 mV (33Moore G.R. Pettigrew G.W. Cytochromes c: Evolutionary, Structural and Physicochemical Aspects. Springer-Verlag, Berlin1990Crossref Google Scholar). Spectra were collected at each redox potential in the titer and analysis of difference spectra indicated that each component had identical reduced absorption maxima. This paper has presented the first spectroscopic characterization of a member of the NapC/NirT family of membrane-anchored multi-heme cytochromes c. The technique of substituting a signal peptide for the membrane-anchor to yield a stable soluble periplasmic multi-heme cytochrome should prove useful for the characterization of other membrane-anchored c-type cytochromes. The soluble NapC is capable of mediating electron transfer between water-soluble quinols and the periplasmic nitrate reductase, demonstrating that it retains functionality in this form. 2M. D. Roldán and D. J. Richardson, unpublished data. The combined approach of UV-visible, EPR, MCD, and redox potentiometry provides unambiguous evidence that NapC binds four hemes, all of which are low spin and bis-His-ligated in the ferric state. Moreover, analysis of the primary structure of the NirT family provides information that supports the heme ligand assignments. Eleven primary structures are available for members of the NapC/NirT family. Our analysis of the globular region of the protein, which includes the four CXXCH heme binding motifs, supports the possibility of a gene duplication leading to two structurally similar di-heme binding domains (Fig. 5). 60–70 amino acids of the N-terminal and C-terminal segments, each containing two CXXCH motifs, were aligned at CXXCH motif I with motif III and CXXCH motif II with motif IV (Fig. 5). The two CXXCH motifs in each segment are spaced around 28 amino acids apart. A conserved His residue (His-81 and His-174; P. denitrificans numbering) lies between the two motifs in each segment. These are candidates for the distal ligand of two of thebis-His hemes predicted from the EPR/MCD. A less well conserved His residue (His-99 and His-194) lies close to the second CXXCH motif in each segment and is a candidate for the ligand of the second bis-His ligated heme in each domain. Therefore, we suggest that in the N-terminal domain His-81 provides the distal ligand to the heme bound by CXXCH motif II and His-99 provides the distal ligand to the heme bound by CXXCH motif I and that in the C-terminal domain His-174 provides the distal ligand to the heme bound to CXXCH motif IV and His-194 provides the distal ligand to the heme bound by CXXCH motif III (Fig. 5). A previous analysis of the primary structure of a NapC/NirT homologue from Chromatium vinosum, which may be involved in electron transfer between periplasmic sulfide dehydrogenase and the QH2/Q pool, has also suggested a duplication of two di-heme domains (34Dolata M.M. van Beeumen J.J. Ambler R.P. Meyer T.E. Cusanovich M.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 14426-14431Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). However, this analysis argued for a His-Met- and bis-His-ligated heme in each domain with Met-68, His-81, Met-161, and His-194 (P. denitrificans numbering) providing the axial ligands. Although the residues Met-68 and Met-161 are highly conserved in all the members of the NapC/NirT family (Fig. 5), our spectroscopic data exclude these amino acids as candidates for the ligands of any of the hemes of NapC. In our analysis, the heme ligands suggested are all completely conserved in the NapC subgroup of the NapC/NirT family. However, it is clear that the proposed heme ligands for NapC are not completely conserved throughout the NapC/NirT family (i.e. His-99). This raises the possibility of ligand substitutions during evolution, which should now be explored through characterization of other members of this important family of multi-heme c-type cytochrome. We are grateful to Ann Reilly for invaluable technical assistance and Dr. Nicholas Watmough for helpful discussions."
https://openalex.org/W2078337351,"PR-39 is a proline-arginine-rich antimicrobial peptide and an important component of innate immunity. In addition to its antimicrobial effects, PR-39 can alter mammalian cell gene expression and behavior. To determine the mechanism through which PR-39 affects mesenchymal cells, we identify a number of binding targets for PR-39 using a biologically active fragment of PR-39 (PR-39(15)). We found that PR-39 binds NIH 3T3 in a saturable manner consistent with the existence of a binding target. Similar to full-length PR-39, PR-39(15) interacts with lipid bilayers. After interacting with the membrane, PR-39(15) rapidly enters human microvascular endothelial cells and binds a number of cytoplasmic proteins. PR-39 selectively binds recombinant SH3-containing proteins and was also found to bind a native SH3-containing protein, p130<sup>Cas</sup>. PR-39(15) treatment of endothelial cells results in altered p130 localization. These results show that PR-39(15) binds an SH3-containing signal transduction molecule that has the potential to explain a myriad of effects PR-39 has on mammalian cell behaviors."
https://openalex.org/W1972765470,"Excitation-contraction uncoupling has been identified as a mechanism underlying skeletal muscle weakness in aging mammals (sarcopenia). The basic mechanism for excitation-contraction uncoupling is a larger number of ryanodine receptors (RyR1) uncoupled to dihydropyridine receptors (DHPRs) (Delbono, O., O'Rourke, K. S., and Ettinger, W. H. (1995) J. Membr. Biol. 148, 211–222). In the present study, we used transgenic mice overexpressing human insulin-like growth factor-1 exclusively in skeletal muscle to test the hypothesis that a high concentration of IGF-1 prevents age-related decreases in DHPR number and in muscle force. Transgenic mice express 10–20-fold higher IGF-1 concentrations than nontransgenic mice at all ages (1–24 months). The number of DHPRs is 50–100% higher, and the DHPR/RyR1 ratio is 40% higher in transgenicsoleus (predominantly type I fiber muscles), extensor digitorum longus (predominantly type II fiber muscles), and the pool of type I and type II fiber muscles than in nontransgenic young (6 months), adult (12 months), and old (24 months) mice. Furthermore, no age-related changes in DHPRs and the DHPR/RyR1 ratio were observed in transgenic muscles. The specific single twitch and tetanic muscle force in old transgenic soleus and extensor digitorum longus muscles are 50% higher than in old nontransgenic muscles. Taken together, these results support the concept that IGF-1- dependent prevention of age-related decline in DHPR expression is associated with stronger muscle contraction in older transgenic mice. Excitation-contraction uncoupling has been identified as a mechanism underlying skeletal muscle weakness in aging mammals (sarcopenia). The basic mechanism for excitation-contraction uncoupling is a larger number of ryanodine receptors (RyR1) uncoupled to dihydropyridine receptors (DHPRs) (Delbono, O., O'Rourke, K.

Insulin-like growth factor (IGF-1)1 is a trophic factor required for the proliferation of myoblasts, the proliferation of myogenic differentiation, and subsequent growth and hypertrophy of myofibers (1Florini J.R. Ewton D.Z. Magri K.A. Mangiacapra F.J. Adv. Exp. Med. Biol. 1993; 343: 319-326Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). IGF-1 has been identified as a potent regulator of gene expression in skeletal muscle. Age-related decrease in plasma IGF-1 concentration is well established (2Hochberg M.C. Lethbridge-Cejku M. Scott Jr., W.W. Reichle R. Plato C.C. Tobin J.D. Arthritis Rheum. 1994; 37: 1177-1180Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar), which may contribute to the decrease in muscle size and strength in the elderly. In addition to effects on muscle development, IGF-1 facilitates skeletal muscle DHPR activity via tyrosine kinase-protein kinase C-dependent phosphorylation (3Delbono O. Renganathan M. Messi M.L. J. Neurosci. 1997; 17: 6918-6928Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Our laboratory has also shown that IGF-1 dependent DHPR modulation is impaired in aging skeletal muscles (4Renganathan M. Sonntag W.E. Delbono O. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1997; 235: 784-789Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar), which may explain, at least partially, the decline in muscle force with aging (5Delbono O. O'Rourke K.S. Ettinger W.H. J. Membr. Biol. 1995; 148: 211-222Crossref PubMed Scopus (183) Google Scholar). Specific muscle strength declines with aging in humans and in several animal models of aging (6Larsson L. Grimby G. Karlsson J. J. Appl. Physiol. 1979; 46: 451-456Crossref PubMed Scopus (894) Google Scholar, 7Grimby G. Saltin B. Clin. Physiol. 1983; 3: 209-218Crossref PubMed Scopus (419) Google Scholar, 8Brooks S.V. Faulkner J.A. J. Physiol. 1988; 404: 71-82Crossref PubMed Scopus (582) Google Scholar). The impairment in sustaining the contraction tension during prolonged muscle activation seems to be a general phenomenon in aging mammals. It also becomes apparent from a series of studies on in vitro contractility that the decrease in muscle mass does not explain entirely the age-related decrease in skeletal muscle force (8Brooks S.V. Faulkner J.A. J. Physiol. 1988; 404: 71-82Crossref PubMed Scopus (582) Google Scholar, 9Brooks S.V. Faulkner J.A. Am. J. Physiol. 1994; 267: C507-C513Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Therefore, some other mechanisms are involved in age-dependent loss in muscle strength. Studies done in our laboratory in single human skeletal muscle fiber support the theory that sarcolemmal excitation-sarcoplasmic reticulum Ca2+ release uncoupling (EC uncoupling) is a basic mechanism underlying the reported age-related decline in specific skeletal muscle tension (10Delbono O. Renganathan M. Messi M.L. Muscle Nerve Suppl. 1997; 5: S88-S92Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). EC uncoupling results from alterations in the number of dihydropyridine receptors (DHPRs) linked to the Ca2+ release channel/ryanodine receptor (RyR1). The DHPR, a voltage-gated L-type Ca2+ channel, expressed in the tubular sarcolemma, and the RyR1, expressed in the terminal cisternae of the sarcoplasmic reticulum, are key molecules involved in skeletal muscle excitation-contraction coupling (11Schneider M.F. Chandler W.K. Nature. 1973; 242: 244-246Crossref PubMed Scopus (640) Google Scholar). The DHPR undergoes conformational changes that produce intramembrane charge movements. A hypothetical physical interaction between DHPR and RyR1 at the triadic junction leads to sarcoplasmic reticulum Ca2+ release into the myoplasm (12Schneider M.F. Annu. Rev. Physiol. 1994; 56: 463-484Crossref PubMed Scopus (246) Google Scholar, 13Meissner G. Annu. Rev. Physiol. 1994; 56: 485-508Crossref PubMed Scopus (834) Google Scholar). Ca2+ binding to contractile proteins initiates muscle contraction (14Ashley C.C. Mulligan I.P. Lea T.J. Q. Rev. Biophys. 1991; 24: 1-73Crossref PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar). We have reported that the molecular basis for EC uncoupling in Fisher 344 Brown Norway cross rats is a decrease in DHPR expression in fast- and slow-twitch muscles (15Renganathan M. Messi M.L. Delbono O. J. Membr. Biol. 1997; 157: 247-253Crossref PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar). The age-related decrease in DHPR expression leads to a significant impairment in the sarcolemmal action potential transduction into a Ca2+ signal and consequently in a diminished mechanical response. There has been a considerable interest in the use of exogenous IGF-1 to restore age-related losses in muscle mass and strength (16Carter W.J. Clin. Geriatr. Med. 1995; 11: 735-748Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) because a number of studies in vitro have established that IGF-1 elicits pleiotropic effects on myogenic cells, including stimulation of myoblast replication and myogenic differentiation (17Florini J.R. Ewton D.Z. Coolican S.A. Endocr. Rev. 1996; 17: 481-517PubMed Google Scholar). However, overexpression of IGF-1 in skeletal muscle with increased paracrine/autocrine secretion was more effective as a myogenic stimulus than exogenous IGF-1 (18Coleman M.E. DeMayo F. Yin K.C. Lee H.M. Geske R. Montgomery C. Schwartz R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 12109-12116Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (524) Google Scholar). The expression of the α-skeletal actin/human IGF-1 hybrid gene induced overexpression of IGF-1 in FVB mice (18Coleman M.E. DeMayo F. Yin K.C. Lee H.M. Geske R. Montgomery C. Schwartz R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 12109-12116Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (524) Google Scholar). In the present work, we used this animal model to test the hypothesis that high concentration of IGF-1 in skeletal muscle prevents age-related decreases in DHPRs and consequently in muscle force. Human IGF-1 (hIGF-1) transgenic S1S2 mice showed a 10–20-fold increase in IGF-1 concentration and 50–100% increases in the number of DHPRs, whereas no significant change in RyR1 was detected. The prevention of age-related decline in DHPR expression in animals overexpressing IGF-1 was associated with a potentiation of muscle contraction in old mice. These results support the concept that the increase in autocrine/paracrine secretion of hIGF-1 exerts potent stimulatory effects on DHPR expression in adult skeletal muscle, improving its mechanical performance. S1S2 transgenic mice overexpressing hIGF-1 exclusively in skeletal muscle and control wild-type FVB mice were used (18Coleman M.E. DeMayo F. Yin K.C. Lee H.M. Geske R. Montgomery C. Schwartz R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 12109-12116Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (524) Google Scholar, 19Renganathan M. Messi M.L. Schwartz R. Delbono O. FEBS Lett. 1997; 417: 13-16Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). Dr. R. Schwartz (Department of Cell Biology, Baylor College of Medicine) provided the founder mice of the colony. Animals were housed in a pathogen-free area at Wake Forest University School of Medicine and fed ad libitum. Animal procedures followed an approved protocol by the Animal Care and Use Committee of Wake Forest University School of Medicine. FVB and S1S2 transgenic mice were killed by cervical dislocation. IGF-1 concentration from frozen quadriceps muscles of S1S2 transgenic and FVB nontransgenic mice was determined as described previously (19Renganathan M. Messi M.L. Schwartz R. Delbono O. FEBS Lett. 1997; 417: 13-16Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). Briefly, frozen quadriceps muscles were powdered under liquid N2 and then homogenized (1:5 w/v) in 0.1 m acetic acid using a Polytron tissue homogenizer. Homogenate was incubated for 2 h to separate the debris from the supernatant. Homogenate equivalent to 100 μg of protein was added to the reaction mixture containing 50 mm phosphate, pH 7.5, 50 mm NaCl, 10 mm EDTA, 3 mm sodium azide, and 0.25% bovine serum albumin. IGF-1 antiserum was a kind gift from NIDDK, National Institutes of Health. The concentration of antiserum required for the maximum detection of IGF-1 was determined from IGF-1-antiserum titration. IGF-1 antiserum was specifically withheld in some reaction tubes to determine nonspecific binding of radiolabeled IGF-1. Thr59IGF-1 (Bachem, Inc., Torrence, CA) was radiolabeled with 125I using the lactoperoxidase and glucose oxidase procedure (20Sonntag W.E. Steger R.W. Forman L.J. Meites J. Endocrinology. 1980; 107: 1875-1879Crossref PubMed Scopus (244) Google Scholar). The optimal counts needed for maximal IGF-1 detection were determined by titrating radiolabeled IGF-1 against known IGF-1 concentration. To initiate the reaction, 50,000 counts per tube were added and incubated overnight at room temperature. IGF-1-antiserum complex was precipitated by protein A for 30 min, and centrifuging at 3000 × g for 15 min pelleted the precipitate down. Radioactive IGF-1 in the pellet was estimated in a gamma counter. Data were expressed per mg of protein in relation to IGF-1 standards. The minimum and maximum detectable doses were 15 and 1000 pg of IGF-1. Extensor digitorum longus (EDL),soleus, and whole leg muscles were homogenized as described (19Renganathan M. Messi M.L. Schwartz R. Delbono O. FEBS Lett. 1997; 417: 13-16Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). Protein concentration was determined by Coomassie protein assay with bovine serum albumin as the protein calibration standard. DHPR and RyR1 concentrations were determined using the radioligands [3H]PN200–110 and [3H]ryanodine, respectively. Homogenates (1–2 mg/ml protein) were incubated either with 0.05–5 nm [3H]PN200–110 for 1 h at 23 °C in 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 10 μmCa2+, 1 mm diisopropyl fluorophosphate, and 5 μm leupeptin or 0.5–50 nm[3H]ryanodine for 24–48 h at 10 °C in 20 mm Pipes-NaOH, pH 7.0, 1.0 m NaCl, 100 μm Ca2+, 5 mm AMP, 1 mm diisopropyl fluorophosphate, and 5 μmleupeptin. Membrane bound [3H]PN200–110 and [3H]ryanodine were determined by filtration through Whatman GF/B filters using a Millipore unit (XX2702550, Millipore Corp., Bedford, MA). Filters were rinsed three times with 5 ml of ice-cold 200 mm choline chloride, 20 mmTris-HCl, pH 7.5. Nonspecific [3H]PN200–110 and [3H]ryanodine binding was assessed in the presence of 10 μm unlabeled nifidepine (Sigma) or PN200–110 (Sandoz Pharmaceutical, East Hanover, NJ) and 10 μm unlabeled ryanodine (Calbiochem, San Diego, CA), respectively. Radioligand concentrations used resulted in occupancy of >95% of the high affinity binding sites (21Anderson K. Cohn A.H. Meissner G. Am. J. Physiol. 1994; 266: C462-C466Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Linear regression and nonlinear least squares analysis were used to calculate nonspecific and total binding of the radioligands to the receptors. Specific binding of [3H]PN200–110 and [3H]ryanodine at each concentration was calculated by subtracting the nonspecific binding from the total binding obtained from the above analysis. The following equation,y=((xa)/(x+b))+xc(Eq. 1) where a = receptor number (B max), b =K d (dissociation constant), and c = the nonspecific binding or the low affinity site, was used to fit the binding isotherm. Data were also given in a graphical representation of the Scatchard plot. All values were analyzed for statistical significance using the unpaired Student's t test. Small bundles of fibers from EDL and soleus muscles from 24–26-month-old transgenic and nontransgenic mice were dissected. The bundle of muscle fibers was equivalent to about ¼ of the entire muscle. Whole muscle weight and bundle wet mass values are included in Table III. We used bundles of fibers to facilitate oxygenation of the core fibers and ameliorate pH and ionic gradients from the outer to the inner layers of the muscle (22Delbono O. Kotsias B.A. Pflügers Arch. 1987; 410: 394-400Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar, 23Segal S.S. Faulkner J.A. Am. J. Physiol. 1985; 248: C265-C270Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). All of the bundles from a mouse were tested within 4 h of muscle dissection. The bath buffered physiological solution used for contraction studies contained the following: NaCl, 121 mm; NaHCO3, 24 mm; glucose, 5.5 mm; KCl, 5 mm; CaCl2, 1.8 mm; MgCl2, 0.5 mm; NaH2PO4, 0.4 mm; andd-tubocurarine chloride, 0.025 mm (24Balnave C.D. Allen D.G. J. Physiol. 1996; 492: 705-713Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). All of the experiments were carried out at room temperature (22–24 °C). The solution pH was maintained at approximately 7.4 by buffering with a gas mixture of 95% O2 and 5% CO2. The fiber bundles were placed horizontally in a recording chamber, and one tendon was fastened to a micromanipulator that allowed bundle micropositioning in the three axes. The other tendon was tied to a Grass FT 03 force transducer (self-resonant frequency of 85 Hz). Analog signals were digitized using a 1200 Digidata (Axon Instruments, Foster City, CA). For data acquisition and analysis pClamp 6.3 software was used (Axon). Data were sampled at 2 kHz. Muscle bundles were field stimulated with a pair of platinum electrodes connected to a Grass electrical stimulator. The pulse waveform was acquired and digitized together with the contraction signal. Isometric contractions were measured at optimal fiber length (L o) using supramaximal pulses.L o was defined as the fiber length at which maximal force was recorded in response to 50-ms pulses. The frequency-force relationship was studied for each muscle bundle and peak twitch and tetanic tensions were measured. After measurements of muscle bundle force, the tendons were removed, and the bundle was blotted and immediately weighed. Muscle bundle cross-sectional area (cm2) was calculated by dividing muscle wet mass by the product of fiber length and muscle density (1.06 g/cm3) (8Brooks S.V. Faulkner J.A. J. Physiol. 1988; 404: 71-82Crossref PubMed Scopus (582) Google Scholar,23Segal S.S. Faulkner J.A. Am. J. Physiol. 1985; 248: C265-C270Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Soleus and EDL fiber lengths were measured under video control in small bundles (3–5 fibers) stretched toL o in a separate group of experiments (n = 5 for transgenic and nontransgenicsoleus and EDL muscles).

The aim of this study is to determine whether age-dependent decrease in DHPRs and the decline in muscle strength can be prevented or delayed by specific overexpression of IGF-1 in skeletal muscle. S1S2 transgenic mice overexpressing hIGF-1 exclusively in skeletal muscle and control FVB nontransgenic mice were used for that purpose (18Coleman M.E. DeMayo F. Yin K.C. Lee H.M. Geske R. Montgomery C. Schwartz R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 12109-12116Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (524) Google Scholar). Age-related changes were determined using groups of 1-, 2-, 3-, 6-, 12-, and 24-month-old transgenic and nontransgenic mice. The extent of hIGF-1 gene expression was determined by measuring IGF-1 concentration in individual quadriceps muscles. Skeletal muscles from S1S2 transgenic mice exhibited a 10–20-fold higher IGF-1 concentration compared with nontransgenic mice (Table I, P < 0.01). The increase in IGF-1 concentration in the transgenic mice used in the present study is similar to that reported previously (18Coleman M.E. DeMayo F. Yin K.C. Lee H.M. Geske R. Montgomery C. Schwartz R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 12109-12116Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (524) Google Scholar, 19Renganathan M. Messi M.L. Schwartz R. Delbono O. FEBS Lett. 1997; 417: 13-16Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). The severalfold increases in IGF-1 concentration in skeletal muscle was sustained from 1- to 24-month-old mice (Table I). Therefore, the transgenic mice S1S2 is an appropriate model to determine whether age-dependent changes in skeletal muscle can be prevented by specific overexpression of IGF-1 in skeletal muscle.Table IHigh affinity [3H]PN200–110 and [3H]ryanodine binding and their ratio to skeletal muscle isolated from S1S2 transgenic and nontransgenic miceAge[IGF-1]1-aStatistically significant difference was seen between nontransgenic and transgenic mice (P < 0.01).[3H]PN200–110[3H]RyanodineRatioB maxK dB maxK dmonthsNontransgenic 12032 ± 4872.49 ± 0.081.66 ± 0.512.86 ± 0.2212.8 ± 2.60.88 ± 0.04 22993 ± 4662.28 ± 0.081.60 ± 0.192.33 ± 0.1514.8 ± 0.20.98 ± 0.04 31215 ± 5023.03 ± 0.031.77 ± 0.143.11 ± 0.088.4 ± 3.70.97 ± 0.02(P < 0.01 )(P < 0.01) 62057 ± 6522.77 ± 0.182.48 ± 0.843.06 ± 0.1910 ± 2.30.91 ± 0.05 12917 ± 1202.79 ± 0.122.10 ± 0.392.84 ± 0.139.2 ± 0.90.99 ± 0.03 241336 ± 3521.68 ± 0.081.48 ± 0.422.52 ± 0.0919.5 ± 3.50.67 ± 0.03(P < 0.001)(P < 0.05)(P < 0.001)Transgenic 127384 ± 57344.35 ± 0.27 (P < 0.001)1.39 ± 0.543.34 ± 0.1723 ± 41.30 ± 0.03 (P < 0.01) 225900 ± 87064.89 ± 0.38 (P < 0.001)3.01 ± 1.643.37 ± 0.45 (P < 0.05)22 ± 61.48 ± 0.14 (P < 0.02) 315735 ± 64604.87 ± 0.21 (P < 0.002)2.07 ± 0.323.72 ± 0.1913 ± 51.31 ± 0.03 (P < 0.01) 625861 ± 70324.21 ± 0.10 (P < 0.001)2.05 ± 0.393.17 ± 0.1316 ± 51.33 ± 0.02 (P < 0.01) 1222705 ± 70374.09 ± 0.13 (P < 0.001)1.24 ± 0.473.13 ± 0.149 ± 31.31 ± 0.03 (P < 0.01) 2416845 ± 70074.00 ± 0.09 (P < 0.001)2.58 ± 0.742.82 ± 0.07 (P < 0.01)15 ± 21.42 ± 0.04 (P < 0.01)(P < 0.05)Values of B max, K d, and IGF-1 are mean ± S.E. and are expressed in pmol/mg of protein, nm, and pg/mg protein, respectively.

The sarcoplasmic reticulum RyR1 was quantitated by radioligand analysis using the neutral plant alkaloid [3H]ryanodine as a high affinity probe in the same muscle homogenates. Fig. 1 shows [3H]PN200–110 (top) and [3H]ryanodine (bottom) binding to 6- and 24-month-old nontransgenic (closed circle) and transgenic (closed square) mice. The insetsare the Scatchard analysis of the ligand binding assay. [3H]PN200–110 and [3H]ryanodineB max and K d and [3H]PN200–110 and [3H]ryanodine (DHPR/RyR1) ratio values are calculated from Scatchard analyses of the binding assay for 1-month (10 determinations in five different preparations), 2-month (6 determinations in three different preparations), 3-month (8 determinations in four different preparations), 6-month (10 determinations in five different preparations), 12-month (8 determinations in four different preparations), and 24-month (10 determinations in five different preparations) age groups and are given in Table I. The number of PN200–110 and ryanodine receptors in FVB mice showed a significant increase at three months of age (P < 0.01) compared with 1- and 2-month-old animals and the increase was sustained in 6-month-old (young) and 12-month-old (adult) animals. However, in aged animals (24 months old), the number of PN200–110 receptors decreased 40% (P < 0.001), and ryanodine receptors decreased 12% (P < 0.05) compared with adult animals. These changes in maximum binding capacity cannot be explained by changes in the dissociation constant of both receptors for their ligand because no significant changes in K d were recorded (Table I). The PN200–110/ryanodine ratio, an indication of the proportion of receptors coupling, is given in Table I. The PN200–110/ryanodineB max ratio is close to 1 in young and adult animals (1–12 months old). This indicates that every fourth foot/RyR1 is linked to a group of four DHPRs, assuming localization at the triadic junction of all DHPRs and RyR1 (21Anderson K. Cohn A.H. Meissner G. Am. J. Physiol. 1994; 266: C462-C466Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). TheB max, K d, and PN200–110/ryanodine ratio values reported for control mice are similar to the values reported earlier for rabbit muscles (21Anderson K. Cohn A.H. Meissner G. Am. J. Physiol. 1994; 266: C462-C466Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), fast-twitch rat EDL muscle (25Delbono O. Meissner G. J. Membr. Biol. 1996; 151: 123-130Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar), and mouse muscles (19Renganathan M. Messi M.L. Schwartz R. Delbono O. FEBS Lett. 1997; 417: 13-16Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). In aged animals, the PN200–110/ryanodine ratio is 0.67 due to the decrease in the number of PN200–110 receptors. These results indicate that in aged skeletal muscles, 23 of the available RyR1s are coupled to DHPRs, and the other 13 of RyR1s are uncoupled due to the age-related decrease in the number of DHPRs. The PN200–110/ryanodine ratio of 0.67 in aged muscle is similar to that reported for aging F344BNF1 rat muscle (15Renganathan M. Messi M.L. Delbono O. J. Membr. Biol. 1997; 157: 247-253Crossref PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar). S1S2 transgenic mice show a 50–100% increases in the number of PN200–110 receptors compared with nontransgenic mice at different ages. These results indicate that specific overexpression of IGF-1 in skeletal muscle results in an increased expression of DHPR. The difference in the number of RyR1 between transgenic and nontransgenic muscles is not statistically significant. Also, in aged transgenic mice, the number of RyR1 depicts a significant age-related decrease, as observed in control mice (P < 0.05). This suggests that IGF-1 does not modulate ryanodine receptor expression. Consequently, the PN200–110/ryanodine ratio in transgenic animals is about 30% higher in transgenic animals compared with nontransgenic animals (P < 0.01), and the increase is similar to results reported earlier for adult transgenic mice (19Renganathan M. Messi M.L. Schwartz R. Delbono O. FEBS Lett. 1997; 417: 13-16Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). The age-related decrease in the number of PN200–110 receptors and PN200–110/ryanodine ratio seen in control mice is absent in transgenic animals. These results demonstrate that the increased availability of IGF-1 in skeletal muscle by exclusive overexpression of hIGF-1 gene prevents age-related decrease in the number of DHPRs and the DHPR/RyR1 ratio. A two-factor analysis of variance was used to see whether the number of PN200–110 receptors and the PN200–110/ryanodine ratio are affected by interaction of the two different factors namely aging and IGF-1concentration (transgenic IGF-1 expression). The effect of aging on DHPRs and the DHPR/RyR1 ratio depends on what level of IGF-1 is present in skeletal muscle. There is a statistically significant interaction between age and status of IGF-1 expression in the number of DHPRs (P = 0.005) and the DHPR/RyR1 ratio (P < 0.001). The age-related decrease in the number of DHPRs depends on whether the animals are nontransgenic or transgenic. In aged nontransgenic animals, the number of DHPRs and the DHPR/RyR1 ratio decrease, whereas in transgenic animals, the specific overexpression of IGF-1 in skeletal muscle prevents age-related decrease in the number of DHPRs and the DHPR/RyR1 ratio. No statistically significant interaction between age and status of IGF-1 expression was observed in the case of RyR1. To determine whether the prevention of the age-related decline in the number of PN200–110 and the PN200–110/ryanodine ratio in transgenic skeletal muscle was due to an effect on fast- and/or slow-twitch muscle fibers, binding assays on fast- or slow-twitch muscles were performed. For this purpose, transgenic and nontransgenic 1-, 2-, 3-, 6-, 12-, and 24-month-old mice were studied. The B max values of PN200–110 and ryanodine in soleus and EDL muscles of nontransgenic mice were determined by a single saturating concentration of [3H]PN200–110 and [3H]ryanodine. Table II shows [3H]PN200–110 and [3H]ryanodine binding to soleus and EDL muscle homogenates from 1-, 2-, 3-, 6-, 12-, and 24-month-old nontransgenic and transgenic mice. The B max values of PN200–110 and ryanodine in soleus and EDL muscles did not change significantly in young (1–6 months old) and adult (12 months old) mice. The number of PN200–110 receptors decreased 30 and 25%, and the PN200–110/ryanodine ratio decreased 30 and 15% in EDL and soleus muscles, respectively, isolated from 24-month-old FVB nontransgenic mice. The decrease in PN200–110/ryanodine ratio in aged EDL and soleus muscles is mainly due to the decrease in the number of PN200–110 sites as seen in muscle pool. In FVB nontransgenic mice, the number of PN200–110-uncoupled ryanodine receptors in soleus is larger than EDL muscles due to lower number of PN200–110 receptors in soleus muscle (25Delbono O. Meissner G. J. Membr. Biol. 1996; 151: 123-130Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). Consequently, the PN200–110/ryanodine binding ratio is less in soleusmuscle than in EDL muscle. These values are similar to those reported by us earlier in rat (15Renganathan M. Messi M.L. Delbono O. J. Membr. Biol. 1997; 157: 247-253Crossref PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar) and mouse (19Renganathan M. Messi M.L. Schwartz R. Delbono O.

https://openalex.org/W2078806556,"Enhancer II (ENII) of hepatitis B virus (HBV) is one of the essential cis-elements for the transcriptional regulation of HBV gene expression. Its function is highly liver-specific, suggesting that liver-enriched transcriptional factors play critical roles in regulating the activity of ENII. In this report, a novel hepatocyte transcription factor, which binds specifically to the B1 region (AACGACCGACCTTGAG) within the major functional unit (B unit) of ENII, has been cloned from a human liver cDNA library by yeast one-hybrid screening, and demonstrated to trans-activate ENII via the B1 region. We named this factor hB1F, for human B1-binding factor. Amino acid analysis revealed this factor structurally belongs to nuclear receptor superfamily. Based on the sequence similarities, hB1F is characterized to be a novel human homolog of the orphan receptor fushi tarazu factor I (FTZ-F1). Using reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction, a splicing isoform of hB1F (hB1F-2) was identified, which has an extra 46 amino acid residues in the A/B region. Examination of the tissue distribution has revealed an abundant 5.2-kilobase transcript of hB1F is present specifically in human pancreas and liver. Interestingly, an additional transcript of 3.8 kilobases was found to be present in hepatoma cells HepG2. Fluorescent in situ hybridization has mapped the gene locus of hB1F to the region q31-32.1 of human chromosome 1. Altogether, this study provides the first report that a novel human homolog of FTZ-F1 binds and regulates ENII of HBV. The potential roles of this FTZ-F1 homolog in tissue-specific gene regulation, in embryonic development, as well as in liver carcinogenesis are discussed.

Hepatitis B virus (HBV)1is the major cause of acute and chronic hepatitis, also closely associated with the development of hepatocellular carcinoma (1Raney A.K. McLachlan A. MaLachlan A. Molecular Biology of the Hepatitis B Virus. CRC Press, Boca Raton, FL1991: 1-37Google Scholar). HBV predominantly infects hepatocytes, which is a prominent characteristic of hepadnaviruses. The genome of HBV is a small, circular, partially double-stranded DNA of about 3.2 kb, which contains four partially overlapping open reading frames (ORF) encoding the surface antigens (preS/S), the core antigen/e antigen (preC/C), the polymerase (P) and the X protein (X), respectively (2Garnem D. Varmus H.E. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1987; 56: 651-693Crossref PubMed Scopus (821) Google Scholar, 3Tiollais P. Pourcel C. Dejean A. Nature. 1985; 317: 489-495Crossref PubMed Scopus (977) Google Scholar). These HBV genes express specifically in liver, controlled by the combinatorial action of the promoters and enhancers. To date, four promoters (Sp1, Sp2, Cp, and Xp) (4Schaller H. Fisher M. Curr. Top. Microbiol. Immunol. 1991; 168: 21-39Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar) have been identified to be responsible for the transcription of the viral mRNAs, and they are regulated by two HBV enhancers. Enhancer I (ENI) functions in a relatively tissue independent manner (5Shaul Y. Rutter W.J. Laub O. EMBO J. 1985; 4: 427-430Crossref PubMed Scopus (165) Google Scholar, 6Tognoni A. Cattaneo R. Serfling E. Schaffner W. Nucleic Acids Res. 1985; 13: 7457-7472Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar), while enhancer II (ENII) shows strong hepatocyte specificity. Enhancer II of HBV is located within the X ORF, about 600 bp downstream of ENI (7Wang Y. Chen P. Wu X. Sun A.L. Wang H. Zhu Y.A. Li Z.P. J. Virol. 1990; 64: 3977-3981Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 8Yee J.K. Science. 1989; 246: 658-661Crossref PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar, 9Yuh C.H. Ting L.P. J. Virol. 1993; 67: 142-149Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In our previous study, ENII was mapped in a 148-bp region from nt 1627 to 1774 (HBV adr1 subtype), partially overlapped with the core promoter (Cp) (7Wang Y. Chen P. Wu X. Sun A.L. Wang H. Zhu Y.A. Li Z.P. J. Virol. 1990; 64: 3977-3981Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). According to the functional analyses, it can be divided into two parts, A and B, with part B as the basal functional unit, which could be further subdivided into three regions B1 (nt 1687–1704), B2 (nt 1705–1735), and B3 (nt 1736–1774) (Fig. 1) (7Wang Y. Chen P. Wu X. Sun A.L. Wang H. Zhu Y.A. Li Z.P. J. Virol. 1990; 64: 3977-3981Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 10Wu X. Zhu L. Li Z.P. Koshy R. Wang Y. Virology. 1992; 191: 490-494Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). ENII plays critical roles in the regulation of the liver-specific viral gene transcription. It is a major cis element regulating the liver-specific transcription initiated by Cp, which is critical for viral replication and morphogenesis (11Honigwachs J. Faktor O. Dikstein R. Shaul Y. Laub O. J. Virol. 1989; 63: 919-924Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). ENII also participates in the regulation of other promoters of HBV genome, and is able to activate heterologous promoters in a highly liver-specific manner (7Wang Y. Chen P. Wu X. Sun A.L. Wang H. Zhu Y.A. Li Z.P. J. Virol. 1990; 64: 3977-3981Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 12Su H. Yee J.K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 2708-2712Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). To elucidate the regulatory mechanism of the liver-specific activity of ENII, a considerable amount of work has been focused on the study of trans-acting factors that interact with ENII. As shown in Fig. 1, many transcription factors have been identified to interact with different regions of ENII. Among these factors, a set of liver-enriched transcription factors such as HNF1, C/EBP, HNF3, and HNF4 are believed to be involved in the determination of hepatocyte specificity of ENII. Recently, we found the B1 region (nt 1688-AACGACCGACCTTGAG-nt 1703) was bound specifically by a novel hepatocyte nuclear factor (B1-binding factor, Fig. 1). 2Y. Xie, M. Li, Y. Wang, P. H. Hofschneider, and L. Weiss, submitted for publication. This binding activity is present in differentiated hepatoma cell line HepG2 but not in the nonhepatic cell line HeLa. Mutations in the B1 region not only aborted the specific binding by this factor, but also significantly reduced the activity of ENII in co-transfection analysis. In addition, the disruption of the specific binding was shown to cause a decrease in viral gene transcription initiated from the core promoter, resulting in a reduction of the 3.5-kb pregenomic RNA (13Xie, Y. H. (1997) Interaction of Cellular Transcription Factors with Enhancer II of Hepatitis B Virus. Ph.D. thesis, Shanghai Institute of Biochemistry, Chinese Academy of Sciences; Max-Plank-Institute of Biochemistry, GermanyGoogle Scholar, 14Xie Y.H. Wang Y. Hofschneider P.H. Weiss L. Molecular Biology of Hepatitis B Viruses Meeting. 1997; (, organized by C. Brechot and J. Summers, Institut Pasteur, Paris): O5Google Scholar). Therefore, this binding site has an important function in regulating the ENII activity, and consequently, it affects the global HBV gene expression. Our previous efforts to identify the B1-binding factor have suggested it not to be any members of known liver-enriched factors such as HNF1, HNF3, HNF4, or C/EBP (13Xie, Y. H. (1997) Interaction of Cellular Transcription Factors with Enhancer II of Hepatitis B Virus. Ph.D. thesis, Shanghai Institute of Biochemistry, Chinese Academy of Sciences; Max-Plank-Institute of Biochemistry, GermanyGoogle Scholar, 15Wang W.X. Li M. Wu X. Wang Y. Li Z.P. Res. Virol. 1998; 149: 99-108Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar), but a novel hepatocyte transcription factor uncharacterized before; it was thus considered of great interest to clone and characterized this factor. For this purpose, we employed a yeast one-hybrid screen (16Alexandre C. Grueneberg D.A. Gilman M.Z. Methods. 1993; 5: 147-155Crossref Scopus (20) Google Scholar, 17Li J.J Herskowitz I. Science. 1993; 262: 1870-1874Crossref PubMed Scopus (368) Google Scholar, 18Wang M.M. Reed R.R. Nature. 1993; 364: 121-126Crossref PubMed Scopus (371) Google Scholar) to clone the cDNA of the B1-binding factor. By screening GAL4 activation domain (AD) fused-cDNA library of human adult normal liver, we isolated a cDNA named hB1F (humanB1-binding factor) and investigated both its interaction with the B1 region in vitro and its trans-regulatory effects on ENII in vivo. hB1F was further characterized as a novel human homolog of FTZ-F1, an orphan nuclear receptor that was originally identified as a transcriptional factor involved in the regulation of fushi tarazu(ftz) expression in early Drosophila melanogasterembryos (19Lavorgna G. Ueda H. Clos J. Wu C. Science. 1991; 252: 848-851Crossref PubMed Scopus (247) Google Scholar). The two oligonucleotides, 5′-gatcAACGACCGACCTTGAG-3′ and 3′-TTGCTGGCTGGAACTCctag-5′, contained the B1 fragment in capital letters with extra nucleotides in lowercase letters added for cloning purpose, were chemically synthesized and annealed. Four tandem repeats of the B1 fragment were placed upstream of the E1b minimal promoter in HIS3 reporter plasmid (p6012), and the CYC1 minimal promoter in lacZ reporter plasmid (pCZII), respectively (CLONTECH). These two plasmids were linearized and sequentially integrated into Saccharomyces cerevisiae YM4271 (MAT a , ura3-52, his3-200, ade2-101, lys2-801, leu2-3, 112, trp1-903, tyr1-501) (CLONTECH) to obtain a reporter yeast strain YMB1-HB. The yeast was then transformed with human liver MATCHMAKER cDNA library (CLONTECH) and selected on histidine-deficient (His−) plates containing 3-aminotriazole (45 mm was shown optimal for suppressing HIS3 background growth). Large colonies (His+) were transferred onto Hybond N filters (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) and further screened for β-galactosidase activity (20Breeden L. Nasmyth K. Cold Spring Harbor Symp. Quant. Biol. 1985; 50: 643-650Crossref PubMed Scopus (470) Google Scholar). After being placed in liquid nitrogen for 30 s, the filters were incubated in a buffer containing 0.8 mm6-bromo-4-chloro-3-indolyl-β-d-galactosidase at 30 °C. The positive interaction was determined by the appearance of blue colonies. The LacZ+ colonies were selected and plasmids were recovered (21Kaiser P. Auer B. BioTechniques. 1993; 14: 552PubMed Google Scholar). The candidate plasmids isolated from the positive clones were transformed into YMB1-HB to retest for His+phenotype and β-galactosidase activity. Those that could reproduce the positive phenotypes were called true positive clones and their cDNA inserts were sequenced and further characterized. EcoRI-digested 2.5-kb cDNA of the isolated positive clone (named pGAD-16) containing the complete hB1F coding sequence was inserted downstream of the T7 promoter of the pBS(+) (Stratagene), and used for in vitrotranslation in a typical 50-μl reaction volume of TNT coupled reticulocyte lysate systems (Promega), containing 25 μl of rabbit reticulocyte lysate, 1 μl of 1 mm amino acids, and 1 μg of DNA template. The BglII-NdeI fragment of pGAD-16 (nt 158–696) (see Fig. 3 B) containing the suspected DNA-binding domain of hB1F was made blunt-ended and in-frame fused with glutathione S-transferase by inserting into theSmaI digested pGEX-3X vector (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). The glutathione S-transferase fusion protein was expressed in Eschericha coli. BL21 essentially as described by Smith and Johnson (22Smith D.B. Johnson K.S. Gene (Amst.). 1988; 67: 31-40Crossref PubMed Scopus (5047) Google Scholar), then was purified with glutathione-Sepharose 4B (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). The nuclear extract of HepG2 cells and HeLa cells was prepared according to the method of Andreas and Faller (23Andreas N.C. Faller D.V. Nucleic Acids Res. 1991; 19: 2499Crossref PubMed Scopus (2214) Google Scholar). The detailed procedure has been described previously (24Li M. Xie Y.H. Wu X. Kong Y.Y. Wang Y. Virology. 1995; 214: 371-378Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). Briefly, cells were first suspended in 400 μl of buffer A (10 mm HEPES-KOH pH 7.9, 10 mm KCl, 1.5 mm MgCl2, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride), kept on ice for 15 min, and then homogenized in a Dounce homogenizer with a B pestle about 20–25 strokes. After centrifugation, the nuclear pellet was resuspended in 200 μl of buffer B (20 mm HEPES-KOH, pH 7.9, 420 mm NaCl, 1.5 mm MgCl2, 0.2 mm EDTA, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 1 mmphenylmethylsulfonyl, fluoride, 25% glycerol), and kept on ice for 20 min. The supernatant was collected after centrifugation, immediately frozen in small aliquots in liquid nitrogen, and stored at −70 °C. Oligonucleotides used in EMSA were the following: B1, 5′-GATCAACGACCGACCTTGAG-3′ and 3′-TTGCTGGCTGGAACTCCTAG-5′; B1m (mutant B1, the mutated nucleotides are in lowercase letters), 5′-GATCAACtACaGAtCTcGAG-3′ and 3′-TTGaTGtCTaGAgCTCCTAG-5′. EMSA was performed as described previously (24Li M. Xie Y.H. Wu X. Kong Y.Y. Wang Y. Virology. 1995; 214: 371-378Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). In the binding reaction,32P-end-labeled probe (0.1–1 ng, 10,000 cpm) was mixed with 1–2 μg of poly(dI-dC) (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech), 2–6 μg of nuclear extract, or 2 μl of in vitro translation product in a 20-μl reaction mixture containing 10 mmTris-HCl (pH 7.5), 90 mm NaCl, 0.15 mmMgCl2, 0.2 mm EDTA, 0.1 mmdithiothreitol, 0.1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and 5% glycerol. After incubation at room temperature for 25 min, the mixture was resolved on a 5% nondenaturing polyacrylamide gel. In the competition assay, competitors were added to the reaction mixture and incubated at 0 °C for 10 min prior to the addition of the probe. The HBV genome fragment (nt 1634–1816) containing ENII and the core promoter (10Wu X. Zhu L. Li Z.P. Koshy R. Wang Y. Virology. 1992; 191: 490-494Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar) was amplified by PCR with [γ-32P]ATP-end-labeled 5′-primer (nt 1634-CCAGGTCTAGACCAAGGTC-nt 1651) and unlabeled 3′-primer (nt 1816-GGTGCTGGTTAACAGACCA-nt 1798), then used as a target DNA. The HBV sequence was derived from plasmid pADR-1, which contains an entire copy of the HBV genome of the subtype adr1 (25Gan R.B. Chu M.J. Shen L.P. Qian S.W. Li Z.P. Sci. Sin. 1987; 30: 507-521Google Scholar). For DNase I footprinting analysis, 2.5–7.5 μg of purified glutathioneS-transferase fusion protein was incubated with 5 μg of poly(dI-dC) and the probe in a 50-μl reaction mixture containing 10 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 90 mm NaCl, 0.15 mm MgCl2, 0.2 mm EDTA, 0.1 mm dithiothreitol, 0.1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and 5% glycerol for 25 min at room temperature. The DNase I digestion was then carried out as described in SureTrack footprinting kit (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). To construct the CAT reporter plasmid pENII(B)/CpCAT, the ENII(B)/Cp fragment (nt 1686–1878) containing the basic functional unit of ENII (part B) and the Cp (10Wu X. Zhu L. Li Z.P. Koshy R. Wang Y. Virology. 1992; 191: 490-494Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar), was amplified by PCR and inserted into the XbaI and HindIII sites of pBS(+) (Stratagene). The CAT reporter gene was then cloned downstream of pENII(B)/Cp. Four point mutations of the B1 region (sequence was listed in an EMSA procedure) were introduced by PCR to construct mutant reporter plasmid pENII(B1m)/CpCAT. To construct the eukaryotic expression plasmid of hB1F, pCMV-hB1F, 2.5-kb hB1F cDNA from pGAD-16 released byEcoRI digestion was inserted downstream of CMV promoter in pCMV-poly vector (a gift from E. Lai). The antisense expression plasmid pAnti-hB1F, which transcribes hB1F in the antisense orientation, was constructed by inserting the hB1F cDNA in the reverse orientation downstream of CMV promoter in the same vector. HepG2 and HeLa cells were propagated in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium with 10% fetal bovine serum at 5% CO2 and 37 °C. DNAs were transfected into HepG2 or HeLa cells by the calcium phosphate precipitation method (26Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar). Cells were harvested 48 h after transfection and the protein extracts were prepared. CAT assay was performed according to the method of Gorman et al. (27Gorman C.M. Moffat L.F. Howard B.H. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1982; 2: 1044-1051Crossref PubMed Scopus (5292) Google Scholar). In the co-transfection assay, different amounts of hB1F expression plasmid (pCMV-hB1F) and 1 μg of the reporter plasmid pENII(B)/CpCAT or pENII(B1m)/CpCAT were used; 1 μg of plasmid pCMV/SEAP (28Berger J. Hauber J. Hauber R. Geiger R. Cullen B.R. Gene (Amst.). 1988; 66: 1-10Crossref PubMed Scopus (583) Google Scholar), which expresses secreted placental alkaline phosphatase (SEAP), was included as internal control. The total amount of DNA plasmids used for each transfection experiment was 15 μg, and the plasmid pBS(+) (Stratagene) was used to make up the difference. Each transfection experiment was performed at least three times. Five primers were synthesized and used in the RT-PCR for amplification of the complete coding sequence of the hB1F in HepG2 cells: primer I, 5′-CCCCCAATCTCTTTTTGTTTTGAAAGC-3′ (nt 1591–1565 in hB1F); primer II, 5′-GAAAGCAGAGCTCCTAGGGGTTGTAAC-3′ (nt 1570–1544); primer III, 5′-GTAACTTATGCTCTTTTGGCATGCAAC-3′ (nt 1548–1522); primer IV, 5′-GAACTGCCTATAATTTCACTAAGAATGTC-3′ (nt 32–60); primer V, 5′-CTAAGAATGTCTTCTAATTCAGATACTGG-3′ (nt 50–78). 100 ng of poly(A)+-RNA from HepG2 or HeLa cells were reverse transcribed with 1 μl (200 units) of SUPERSCRIPT II RNase H− reverse transcriptase (Life Technologies, Inc.), using 2 pmol of primer I. The first round PCR was performed with primers I and IV, and the second round with primers II and V. To increase the specificity of the final PCR product, a third round PCR was performed with primers III and V. The resulting fragment was subcloned into pcDNA3 (Invitrogen) and subsequently sequenced. To examine the distribution of hB1F isoforms with difference within A/B regions, 1 μg of total RNA isolated separately from fetal liver, adult liver, HepG2 cells, and HeLa cells by TRIzol reagent (Life Technologies, Inc.) was reverse transcribed into cDNA with primer VI (5′-CTTGGATCACCTGAGACATGGCTTCTAGC-3′) (nt 521–493). Subsequently, first round PCR was performed using primer VI and primer IV, and second round using primer VII (5′-GTCTTTAAAGCACGGACTTACACCTATTG-3′) (nt 91–119) and primer VIII (5′-CTTCTAGCTTAAGTCCATTGGCTCGGATG-3′) (nt 500–472). The resulting PCR fragments were expected to include part of the A/B region and the C region, and were analyzed by electrophoresis on a 5% nondenaturing polyacrylamide gel. Multiple Tissue Northern blots containing 2 μg of poly(A)+ RNA per lane from multiple human adult tissues were purchased from CLONTECH. Blots were hybridized with random radiolabeled 2.5-kb hB1F cDNA probe (Prime-a-Gene labeling system, Promega) in ExpressHyb hybridization solution (CLONTECH) at 68 °C for 1 h. The filters were washed twice with wash solution I (0.3m NaCl, 0.03 m sodium citrate (pH 7.0), 0.05% SDS) for 20 min at room temperature, and twice with wash solution II (15 mm NaCl, 1.5 mm sodium citrate (pH 7.0), 0.1% SDS) for 30 min at 50 °C. The same filters were hybridized separately with a β-actin cDNA control probe. Twenty micrograms of total RNA isolated from HepG2 and HeLa cells by TRIzol reagent (Life Technologies, Inc.) were electrophoresed in 1.0% agarose-formaldehyde gels, blotted onto Hybond N+ nylon membranes (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech), and subjected to Northern blot hybridization as described above. A 2.5-kb hB1F cDNA probe was biotinylated with dATP using the Life Technologies, Inc. BioNick labeling kit. The FISH detection was performed in See DNA Biotech. Inc. (Canada), according to Heng and Tsui (29Heng H.H.Q. Tsui L.-C. Chromosoma. 1993; 102: 325-332Crossref PubMed Scopus (431) Google Scholar) and Heng et al.(30Heng H.H.Q. Squire J. Tsui L.-C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 9509-9513Crossref PubMed Scopus (521) Google Scholar). The sequence of the hB1F cDNA determined in this study has been deposited in the GenBankTM data base under accession no. HSU80251. Our previous study has revealed that B1 region of HBV ENII is bound specifically by a novel liver-enriched nuclear factor (13Xie, Y. H. (1997) Interaction of Cellular Transcription Factors with Enhancer II of Hepatitis B Virus. Ph.D. thesis, Shanghai Institute of Biochemistry, Chinese Academy of Sciences; Max-Plank-Institute of Biochemistry, GermanyGoogle Scholar, 14Xie Y.H. Wang Y. Hofschneider P.H. Weiss L.

Virol. 1998; 149: 99-108Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). As shown in Fig. 2, using the 16-bp B1 fragment (AACGACCGACCTTGAG) as probe in EMSA, we detected a specific shift (band s) with the nuclear extract of the hepatoma HepG2 cell, but not with that of nonhepatic HeLa cell. When four mutations (AACtACaGAtCTcGAG) were introduced into the B1 fragment, the specific binding was no longer detected. Although HNF4 DNA binding consensus oligonucleotide in large excess amount seemed to be able to compete the B1 specific binding (Fig. 2), the possibility of HNF4 binding was ruled out since HNF4-specific antiserum failed to affect this specific band in a supershift assay (13Xie, Y. H. (1997) Interaction of Cellular Transcription Factors with Enhancer II of Hepatitis B Virus. Ph.D. thesis, Shanghai Institute of Biochemistry, Chinese Academy of Sciences; Max-Plank-Institute of Biochemistry, GermanyGoogle Scholar). As the interaction of the B1-binding factor with B1 fragment was of functional significance (13Xie, Y. H. (1997) Interaction of Cellular Transcription Factors with Enhancer II of Hepatitis B Virus. Ph.D. thesis, Shanghai Institute of Biochemistry, Chinese Academy of Sciences; Max-Plank-Institute of Biochemistry, GermanyGoogle Scholar, 14Xie Y.H. Wang Y. Hofschneider P.H. Weiss L. Molecular Biology of Hepatitis B Viruses Meeting. 1997; (, organized by C. Brechot and J. Summers, Institut Pasteur, Paris): O5Google Scholar), it was of great importance to identify this unknown factor. A yeast one-hybrid screen was employed to clone the B1- binding factor from human liver MATCHMAKER cDNA library (CLONTECH). In a total of approximately 4 × 106 transformants, 19 His+ colonies were selected, of which one colony showed strong β-galactosidase activity (LacZ+). The plasmid of this dual positive colony was recovered from the yeast, and named pGAD-16. When retransformed into the reporter yeast strain, pGAD-16 restored His and LacZ activity, indicating it was a true positive clone. Subsequent sequencing of the 2.5-kb cDNA insert of pGAD-16 revealed a 1.5-kb ORF. Surprisingly, the ORF is in an orientation reverse to the GAL4 AD (Fig. 3 A). This cDNA was probably transcribed by a cryptic promoter located around the ADH1 terminator region of the vector, 3M. Li and Y. Wang, unpublished data. and similar observations had been reported previously (31Chien C.-T. Bartel P.L. Sternglanz R. Fields S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 9578-9582Crossref PubMed Scopus (1225) Google Scholar). The complete sequence of the cDNA insert in pGAD-16 is shown in Fig. 3 B. The presence of an in-frame stop codon TAA upstream of the predicted initiation codon indicated that the cDNA insert contained the complete ORF encoding a protein of 495 amino acids. We named it hB1F for human B1-binding factor. The predicted molecular mass of 54 kDa for hB1F was verified by in vitro translation (data not shown). The amino acid sequence analysis showed that hB1F shared a common modular structure with the nuclear receptors (32Mangelsdorf D.J. Thummel C. Beato M. Herrlich P. Schutz G. Umesono K. Lumberg B. Kastner P. Mark M. Chambon P. Evans R.M. Cell. 1995; 83: 835-839Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (6110) Google Scholar). It consists of subdomains A to E or F (Fig. 3 C), among which the C region (DNA-binding domain) and the E/F region (ligand-binding domain) are the two conserved domains of the nuclear receptor superfamily (33Evans R.M. Science. 1988; 240: 889-895Crossref PubMed Scopus (6341) Google Scholar, 34Tsai M.-J. O'Malley B.W. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1994; 63: 451-486Crossref PubMed Scopus (2702) Google Scholar). The homology comparisons suggested hB1F to be a human homolog of orphan nuclear receptor FTZ-F1 (see below). Since the whole sequences including the DNA-binding domain and the activation domain have been encompassed in this factor, it is then not surprising that hB1F could activate the B1-driven HIS3 and lacZ reporter genes independent of GAL4 AD in the yeast screening. To confirm the binding specificity of the cloned hB1F for the B1 target sequence, in vitro translated hB1F was incubated with labeled B1 probe and analyzed by EMSA. As shown in Fig. 4 A, the formation of shifted complex (band s) could be efficiently competed by unlabeled B1 oligonucleotides, but not by B1m, or other nonspecific oligonucletides. Quite notably, the shifted complex (band s) migrated to a position similar to that of the complex found with the HepG2 nuclear extract (Fig. 2), suggesting that the binding fashion of the cloned hB1F to the B1 sequence was consistent with that of the B1-binding factor observed in the HepG2 nuclear extract. Since hB1F shares the common structure with nuclear receptors (Fig. 3,B and C), a partial hB1F cDNA (nt 158–696, encoding amino acids 35–215) containing the putative DNA-binding domain was fused with glutathione S-transferase and expressed in E. coli. The purified protein glutathioneS-transferase-hB1F(DBD) was able to bind to the B1 target region specifically (data not shown). To localize further the hB1F specific binding site(s) in HBV ENII and core promoter region, we performed a DNase I footprinting analysis, using the labeled fragment of HBV DNA (nt 1634–1816) as target. After incubation with the purified glutathione S-transferase-hB1F(DBD), one region of ENII (nt 1689-ACGACCGACCTTGAGGCA-nt 1706) was shown to be completely protected from DNase I digestion (Fig. 4 B). It agrees well with the B1 region of ENII (nt 1688-AACGACCGACCTTGAG-nt 1703). No other binding site of hB1F was found in ENII and Cp region. The above results provided strong evidence of the specific binding of hB1F to the B1 sequence. Together with the results obtained from a yeast one-hybrid screen, we have demonstrated that hB1F is the human cellular factor binding specifically to the B1 region of enhancer II of HBV. To investigate the functional importance of hB1F to the activity of enhancer II, we performed co-transfection analysis in nonhepatic cells (HeLa) which do not express hB1F protein (see the results of Northern blot analyses, Fig. 8 B). The CAT activity of the reporter plasmid pENII(B)/CpCAT is very low in HeLa cells due to the liver specificity of ENII (Fig. 5 A, lane 1) (24Li M. Xie Y.H. Wu X. Kong Y.Y. Wang Y. Virology. 1995; 214: 371-378Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). When eukaryotic expression plasmid pCMV-hB1F, which contains hB1F cDNA under the control of CMV promoter was co-transfected, the CAT level of pENII(B)/CpCAT could be stimulated with the increasing amount of pCMV-hB1F (Fig. 5 A). However, if mutations were introduced into the B1 region, the activity of ENII could no longer be stimulated by hB1F (Fig. 5 B). These results indicated that hB1F activates ENII via the B1 site.

Angiogenesis is a process of blood vessel formation in which new vessels sprout from existing blood vessels (1Folkman J. D'Amore P.A. Cell. 1996; 87: 1153-1155Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1098) Google Scholar). Blood capillaries are primarily composed of endothelial cells that are normally quiescent in adult mammals under physiological conditions (2Hanahan D. Folkman J. Cell. 1996; 86: 353-364Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (6066) Google Scholar). Angiogenesis is required for a variety of physiological processes such as embryonic development, wound healing, tissue regeneration, and organ regeneration. Outgrowth of new blood vessels under pathological conditions can lead to the development and progression of diseases such as tumor growth, diabetic retinopathy, tissue and organ malformation, and cardiovascular disorders (3Folkman J. Shing Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 10931-10934Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The switch of the angiogenesis phenotype depends upon the net balance between the up-regulation of angiogenic stimulators and the down-regulation of angiogenic suppressors (2Hanahan D. Folkman J. Cell. 1996; 86: 353-364Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (6066) Google Scholar). A variety of growth factors can stimulate angiogenesis in vitro and in vivo (4Folkman J. N. Engl. J. Med. 1995; 333: 1757-1763Crossref PubMed Scopus (2243) Google Scholar). Of the known angiogenic factors, fibroblast growth factors (FGFs)1 and vascular endothelial growth factors are most commonly expressed (5Nguyen M. Watanabe H. Budson A.E. Richie J.P. Hayes D.F. Folkman J. J. Natl. Cancer Inst. 1994; 86: 356-361Crossref PubMed Scopus (449) Google Scholar, 6Ferrara N. Henzel W.J. Biochem. Biophys. Res.

These factors may function synergistically in promoting tumor growth when angiogenic inhibitors are simultaneously down-regulated (10Good D.J. Polverini P.J. Rastinejad F. Lebeau M.M. Lemons R.S.

Multiple factors, including an angiogenic stimulator (FGF) and an inhibitor (transforming growth factor-β), are called into play during wound healing to bring about regrowth of damaged tissues and a functional vascular bed (12Lynch S.E. Colvin R.B. Antoniades H.N. J. Clin. Invest. 1989; 84: 640-646Crossref PubMed Scopus (453) Google Scholar). The strategy to discover a new angiogenic factor depends upon the generation of neovascularization in the chick chorioallantoic membrane assay and in the corneal assay in vivo and in the endothelial cell tube formation and migration assay in vitro. Recently, O'Reilly et al. (13O'Reilly M.S. Holmgren L. Shing Y. Chen C. Rosenthal R.A. Moses M. Lane W.S. Cao Y. Sage E.H. Folkman J.

These proteins suppressed neovascularization in the mouse corneal assay and growth of tumor metastases. In this report we describe the identification of an angiogenic inhibitor from rabbit serum treated with lipopolysaccharide (LPS) by using a BCE cell proliferation assay. Also, we report that this molecule is identical to the prothrombin kringle-2 domain (PtK2). New Zealand White rabbits were challenged intravenously with 150 μg of LPS (serotype 055: B5; Sigma) and were bled 1 h later. The blood was allowed to stand at room temperature for 1 h and then overnight at 4 °C. The blood was centrifuged at 1,000 × g for 30 min to remove hard clots. L929 cells were maintained in Earle's modified Eagle's medium. The medium contained 10% fetal bovine serum, 2 mml-glutamine, 10 units/ml penicillin G, and streptomycin sulfate. All media components were from Life Technologies, Inc. Capillary endothelial cells of the adrenal cortex were cultured from bovine adrenal grands according to the methods of Folkman et al. (15Folkman J. Haudenschild C.C. Zetter B.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1979; 76: 5217-5221Crossref PubMed Scopus (616) Google Scholar) and Gospodarowicz et al. (16Gospodarowicz D. Massoglia J.C. Fujii D.K. J. Cell. Physiol. 1986; 127: 121-136Crossref PubMed Scopus (215) Google Scholar). Briefly, five adrenal glands were obtained in as sanitary conditions as possible from slaughtered calves. The adrenal cortex was extricated from the glands and cut into 1-mm pieces. The sliced tissues were then incubated in 0.5% collagenase at room temperature for 1 h. The detached capillary segment and endothelial cell aggregates were suspended in a culture medium (DMEM containing 10% bovine calf serum, 2 mml-glutamine, 10 units/ml penicillin G, and streptomycin sulfate) and plated onto gelatinized dishes. After 2–4 days, colonies of endothelial cells were mechanically removed using a pipette equipped with a microtip. Endothelial cell aggregates were seeded onto a gelatinized dish and grown in a culture medium containing 3 ng/ml recombinant human bFGF (R & D Systems, Inc.). The cells over 30 passages were used for the endothelial cell proliferation assay. Endothelial cell proliferation assay was performed according to the method of O'Reilly et al. (13O'Reilly M.S. Holmgren L. Shing Y. Chen C. Rosenthal R.A. Moses M. Lane W.S. Cao Y. Sage E.H. Folkman J. Cell. 1994; 79: 315-328Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3162) Google Scholar). BCE cells were maintained in DMEM containing 10% heat-inactivated bovine calf serum and 3 ng/ml recombinant human bFGF. Cells growing in gelatin-coated six-well plates were dispersed in a 0.05% trypsin solution and resuspended with DMEM containing 10% bovine calf serum. Approximately 12,500 cells in 0.5 ml were added to each well of gelatinized 24-well plates and incubated at 37 °C (in 10% CO2) for 24 h. The media were replaced with 0.25 ml of fresh DMEM containing 5% bovine calf serum, and samples were added to each well. After 30 min of incubation, media were added to obtain a final volume of 0.5 ml of DMEM containing 5% bovine calf serum and bFGF at 1 ng/ml. After 72 h of incubation, the cells were trypsinized and counted using a hemocytometer. To ensure that any inhibition observed was not due to detachment of the BCE cells from the plate, all wells of the assay were examined for evidence of cell detachment under an inverted microscope prior to cell counting. Cytotoxic activity was determined by using mouse L929 fibroblast cells as described by Ruff and Gifford (17Ruff M.R. Gifford G.E. J. Immunol. 1980; 125: 1671-1677PubMed Google Scholar). To purify the rabbit angiogenic inhibitor, we used both TNF cytotoxicity assay and BCE cell proliferation assay, because the endothelial cell growth inhibitory activity co-eluted with fibroblast cell cytotoxic activity on conventional chromatography procedures. Briefly, solid ammonium sulfate was added to LPS-treated rabbit serum to 80% saturation. Pellets were dialyzed against 10 mm NaPi, pH 7.0 containing 50 mm NaCl. The dialyzed proteins were applied to a DEAE-Sephacel column previously equilibrated with a starting buffer (10 mm NaPi, 50 mmNaCl). The column was eluted at 4 °C with a linear gradient of 50–500 mm NaCl in 10 mm NaPi, pH 7.0. The active fractions were pooled, concentrated, and loaded at 4 °C onto a Sephacryl S-200 column equilibrated with 50 mm NaPi, pH 7.0. The active fractions were loaded at room temperature onto a Mono Q column equilibrated with 50 mm NaPi, pH 7.0. The column was eluted with a linear gradient of 125–300 mm NaCl in 50 mmNaPi, pH 7.0. The active fractions from the FPLC-Mono Q column were loaded on a preparative native 12.5% polyacrylamide gel (LKB, Inc.). After electrophoresis for 48 h at 50 V and 4 °C, the gels were sliced to 5-mm and eluted in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS), and the eluates were assayed for BCE cell proliferation and L929 cell cytotoxicity. N-terminal amino acid sequence analysis was performed with 10 μg of the protein electroblotted onto a polyvinylidene difluoride membrane (Bio-Rad). For internal peptide sequencing, protein samples were dissolved in 100 μl of digestion buffer (20 mm Tris-HCl, 100 mm NaCl, and 5% acetonitrile, pH 7.8). Digestion was performed with trypsin, chymotrypsin, and V8 protease, respectively, at an enzyme to substrate ratio of 1:50 for 12 h at 37 °C. The digested proteins were then applied to a C18-reverse phase column for the isolation of digested products. The isolated peptide fragments were sequenced on a model 477A protein sequencer (Applied Biosystems, Inc., Foster City, CA). For C-terminal amino acid sequencing, the purified angiogenic inhibitor was incubated with carboxypeptidase Y at a 1:50 molar ratio for 3, 10, and 30 min, respectively. Each aliquot was then loaded directly onto a Beckman 6300 amino acid analyzer. For the amino acid composition of the purified angiogenic inhibitor, the carboxymethylated proteins (20 μg) were dissolved in 0.2 ml of acid hydrolysis solution (6 n HCl, 0.01% phenol, 0.005% 2-mercaptoethanol) in an acid-washed hydrolysis tube. The sample was then sealed under reduced pressure and hydrolyzed at 110 °C for 24 h. The amino acid composition of the sample was determined using a Beckman 6300 amino acid analyzer. Rabbit prothrombin (Pt) was purified according to the modified method of Weinstein et al. (18Weinstein R.E. Rickles F.R. Walker F.J. Tromb. Res. 1990; 59: 759-772Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar). The blood was treated with 0.85% sodium citrate and centrifuged at 1,000 ×g for 30 min to remove blood cells and insoluble materials. Benzamidine HCl and P-PACK (d-phenylalanyl-l-prolyl-l-arginine chroromethyl ketone, Calbiochem, Inc.) were added to a final concentration of 5 mm and 1 μM, respectively. Ten grams of QMA Accell (Waters, Inc.) were added to 350 ml of plasma, and the mixture was stirred at room temperature for 1 h. After allowing the QMA to settle, the plasma was decanted, and the beads were washed several times with a Tris buffer (20 mm Tris-HCl, 100 mm NaCl, 5 mm benzamidine HCl, 1 μM P-PACK, pH 7.5). The QMA-bound proteins were eluted with a Tris buffer containing 0.6 m NaCl. The supernatant was pooled, and solid sodium citrate was added to a final concentration of 0.6%. Barium chloride (8 ml of 1 m BaCl2/100 ml) was added dropwise, and the suspension was stirred at 4 °C for 1 h. After centrifugation at 4,500 × g for 20 min, the pellet was resuspended in 0.2 m EDTA, 5 mmbenzamidine HCl and then dialyzed overnight at 4 °C against the Tris buffer. The proteins were applied to a 1 × 16-cm column of QMA Accell and then eluted from the column with a linear gradient of 0.2–0.4 m NaCl using an FPLC apparatus. Prothrombin pools were identified with SDS-PAGE and were dialyzed for 4 h at 4 °C against a Tris buffer containing 50 mm NaCl and applied to a Blue-Sephadex column. After being washed with the dialysis buffer, bound prothrombin was eluted with a Tris buffer containing 0.6m NaCl. The purified Pt was dialyzed at 4 °C overnight against the Tris buffer (100 mm Tris-HCl, 150 mm NaCl, 1 mm CaCl2, pH 8.0) and incubated with factor Xa (Sigma) at 23 °C overnight on a water bath. The proteolytic fragments were loaded to a preparative native 12.5% polyacrylamide gel (LKB, Inc.). After electrophoresis for 48 h in 50 V at 4 °C, the gels were sliced to 5-mm and eluted in PBS. The eluates containing the PtK2 were pooled, dialyzed extensively against doubly distilled water, and lyophilized. The isolated PtK2 was analyzed by N-terminal sequencing and assayed for BCE cell proliferation. Human plasminogen (Pg) was purified according to the modified method of Deutsch and Mertz (19Deutsch D.G. Mertz E.T. Science. 1970; 170: 1095-1096Crossref PubMed Scopus (1670) Google Scholar). Two liters of blood were treated with 0.85% sodium citrate and centrifuged at 1,000 × g for 30 min to remove blood cells and insoluble materials. The sample was diluted 1:2 with PBS and applied to a lysine-Sepharose column equilibrated with PBS. The column was washed by 0.3 m NaPi, pH 7.0, containing 3 mm EDTA and then eluted with 0.2m aminocaproic acid, pH 7.4. Pg pools were identified with SDS-PAGE. The eluent was diluted with an equal volume of chloroform, and the aqueous phase was removed and dialyzed extensively using 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4. Angiostatin was produced from the purified Pg by a limited proteolytic digest according to the method of O'Reilly et al. (20O'Reilly M.S. Holmgren L. Chen C. Folkman J. Nat. Med. 1996; 2: 689-692Crossref PubMed Scopus (1150) Google Scholar). Briefly, porcine pancreatic elastase (Sigma) was added (0.8 unit/mg) to 100 mg of Pg in 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4. The solution was incubated at 37 °C for 5 h and then loaded onto a lysine-Sepharose column that had been equilibrated with 50 mm NaPi, pH 7.0. The column was washed and subsequently eluted with 0.2 m aminocaproic acid. The eluent was concentrated and loaded onto a Sephacryl S-200 gel column previously equilibrated with PBS. The angiostatin containing fractions was pooled, dialyzed by doubly distilled water, and lyophilized. Purified angiostatin was analyzed on SDS-PAGE followed by Coomassie staining and by N-terminal sequencing. Rats were injected with 80 μg of recombinant rabbit PtK2 in Freund's complete adjuvant, followed by 80 μg in Freund's incomplete adjuvant at 2-week intervals after the priming injection. After 4 weeks, antibody formation was detected by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay, and final boosting was followed by 20 μg of recombinant rabbit PtK2 in PBS. After 1 week, the rats were bled, and the titer of the antiserum was assessed by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. For immunoblot analysis, the samples were resolved on 15% SDS-PAGE or 12.5% native PAGE and electrophoretically transferred to nitrocellulose membranes. The primary antibody was diluted 1/100 in PBS. The bound primary antibody was detected by a secondary antibody (peroxidase-conjugated goat anti-rat Ig G, Sigma). Total RNA was isolated from the rabbit liver using the guanidium thiocyanate extraction method described by Chomczynshi and Sacchi (21Chomczynshi P. Sacchi N. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1972; 69: 1408-1412Crossref PubMed Scopus (5183) Google Scholar). Complementary DNA prepared from a New Zealand White rabbit liver RNA was used in each series of polymerase chain reaction experiments. The primers used for polymerase chain reaction were a series of degenerative oligonucleotides based on the amino acid sequences of the angiogenic inhibitor determined by Edman degradation (5′-end primers of nnnnnnacyggncaytccgg (TGHSG) andcaytcnggngtnaaycarcc (HSGVTQP) and 3′ primers ofnnnnnnccytcdatngcrtaytc (EEAIEG) andgcrtaytcnccnagnacytcytc (EVLGLEEA)). The amplified products were directly ligated to the pGEM-T vector (Promega, Inc.) and sequenced by the dideoxy chain termination method (22Sanger F. Nicklen S. Coulson A.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1977; 74: 5463-5467Crossref PubMed Scopus (52602) Google Scholar). Recombinant PtK2 was expressed in Escherichia coli strain BL21(DE3) using a periplasmic secretion pET22b vector (Novagen). The crude extract was loaded onto a DEAE-Sephacel column that had been equilibrated with 10 mm NaPi, pH 7.0, containing 50 mm NaCl. Proteins were eluted with an NaCl gradient. Fractions containing PtK2 were pooled, concentrated, and loaded on a Sephacryl S-200 column equilibrated with 50 mmNaPi, pH 7.0. The purified PtK2 was analyzed on SDS-PAGE followed by Coomassie staining and N-terminal sequencing. Reduction and alkylation were performed according to Caoet al. (23Cao Y. Ji R.W. Davidson D. Schaller J. Marti D. Sohndel S. McCance S.G. O'Reilly M.S. Llinas M. Folkman J. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 29461-29467Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (373) Google Scholar). Fifty μg of purified protein in 0.3 ml of DMEM in the absence of serum were incubated at room temperature with 15 μl of 0.5 m dithiothreitol for 15 min. After incubation, 30 μl of 0.5 m iodoacetamide was added to the reaction. The protein solution was dialyzed at 4 °C for 6 h against 100 volumes of DMEM. After dialysis, the samples were analyzed on SDS-PAGE under nonreducing conditions and assayed for their inhibitory activities on BCE cell proliferation. Three-day-old fertilized eggs were incubated at 37 °C in 3% CO2, and a window was made after the extraction of ovalbumin (24Nguyen M. Shing Y. Folkman J. Microvasc. Res. 1994; 47: 31-40Crossref PubMed Scopus (224) Google Scholar). After 2 days of incubation, a Thermanox coverslip (Nunc, Inc.) containing rPtK2 (20 μg) was applied to the CAM (chorioallantoic membrane) of individual embryos. After 48 h, a 20% fat emulsion was injected into the chorioallantois of the embryos, and CAMs were photographed. Previously, we reported a purification of a TNF-like factor from the serum of New Zealand White rabbits, which was stimulated by LPS. Several experimental procedures, including immunoblot analysis, receptor binding assay, and cell line specificity, indicated that the TNF-like factor might be a high molecular mass form of TNFα (25Lee T.H. Rhim T.Y. Son O.K. Kim Y.H. Kim S.S. Immunol. Lett. 1998; 60: 97-102Crossref PubMed Scopus (1) Google Scholar). When a highly purified TNF-like factor was further purified by native PAGE elution, the bioactive fractions were separated into two peaks by BCE cell proliferation assay (Fig. 1 B). The upper fractions that showed both BCE cell growth inhibition and L929 cell cytotoxicity were able to bind antibodies against recombinant human TNFα (rhTNFα) on native PAGE under nonreducing conditions (Fig. 1 A, right panel). This result was consistent with the previous report that TNFα had potent BCE cell growth inhibitory activity (26Schweigerer L. Malerstein B. Gospodarowicz D. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1987; 143: 997-1004Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). On the other hand, the lower fractions that revealed only BCE cell growth inhibition did not react with antibodies against rhTNFα (Fig. 1 A, right panel). This result suggests that the lower fractions contain materials that are immunogenically different from TNFα. When the pooled lower fractions were subjected to SDS-PAGE under reducing conditions, a 22-kDa single band was observed by silver staining (Fig. 2, inset). Using a native PAGE elution step, we isolated 0.2 mg of angiogenic inhibitor from rabbit serum containing 30,000 mg of total protein. The half-maximal inhibition in BCE cell proliferation was observed when a 2 μg/ml concentration of this angiogenic inhibitior was treated. The amino acid sequence of the angiogenic inhibitor was determined by automated Edman degradation (Fig. 3 A). Approximately 10 μg of the purified protein (the pooled lower fractions) was electroblotted to a polyvinylidene difluoride membrane and sequenced on a model 477 protein sequencer. In one extended sequencing run, an essentially single N-terminal amino acid sequence was clearly identified through 27 cycles, suggesting that only one sort of protein molecule was present in the isolated active material. For the internal peptide sequencing, 40 μg of the protein was digested with trypsin, chymotrypsin, or V8 protease, respectively. The digested peptides were isolated by high performance liquid chromatography and sequenced by automated Edman degradation on a protein sequencer. The cysteic acid residues were identified from the molar ratio of carboxymethylated cysteine determined by amino acids composition analysis (data not shown) and from mass spectrometer analysis of the proteolytic fragments (data not shown). Repeated sequence analyses of the overlapping proteolytic digests indicated that the rabbit angiogenic inhibitor consists of approximately 110 amino acids. However, we could not obtain a full sequence corresponding to the molecular size of 22 kDa. Thus, we determined the molecular mass of the angiogenic inhibitor by mass spectrometer analysis. Unexpectedly, this analysis showed two peaks, a minor peak with a molecular mass of 12.3 kDa and a major peak with a molecular mass of 12.6 kDa (Fig. 2). The abnormal behavior of the rabbit angiogenic inhibitor on SDS-PAGE could possibly be due to an unusually large number of proline residues (10% of total amino acids) in the protein (27Pham D.Q. Sivasubramanian N. Gene (Amst.). 1992; 122: 345-348Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar). However, a high number of glutamate residues on the C-terminal portion of the molecule may also be responsible for the abnormality (28Kaufmann E. Geisler N. Weber K. FEBS Lett. 1984; 170: 81-84Crossref PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar). The amino acid sequence of the angiogenic inhibitor showed high homology with the human and mouse PtK2. Since the cDNA encoding rabbit prothrombin was partially cloned and the nucleotide sequence encoding kringle-2 domain (K2) was not available (29Karpatkin M. Tnag Z. Meer J. Blei F. Samuels H.H. Thromb. Res. 1991; 62: 757-763Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (5) Google Scholar), we obtained cDNA encoding rabbit PtK2 from rabbit liver RNA. The nucleotide sequence of the amplified polymerase chain reaction products was determined by the dideoxy chain termination method (Fig. 3 B). The amino acid sequence deduced from its cDNA was well matched with the sequence of the angiogenic inhibitor as described above and was very similar to the known human and bovine PtK2 sequence (Fig. 4). The C-terminal amino acid of PtK2 as judged by the factor Xa cleavage site was supposed to be arginine. However, when the angiogenic inhibitor was digested by carboxypeptidase Y, the first released amino acid was glycine (Fig. 3 A). This analysis revealed that the C-terminal arginine residue of PtK2 was deleted in the angiogenic inhibitor. To confirm the identity between the angiogenic inhibitor and PtK2 at the protein level, we purified rabbit prothrombin and obtained the kringle-2 domain from prothrombin by factor Xa cleavage (Fig. 5, lanes A–C). The molecular mass of PtK2 derived from prothrombin was 22 kDa on SDS-PAGE under reducing conditions (Fig. 5, lane C), and mass spectrometer analysis revealed a 12.4-kDa protein and a 12.7-kDa protein (data not shown). When the N-terminal amino acid sequence of this protein was analyzed by automated Edman degradation, a major sequence was clearly identified through 15 cycles. Two positions were unassigned due to the lack of a signal (Fig. 3 C). A secondary sequence (approximately 110 the primary signal) starting at the fourth amino acid (serine) was also detectable. These N-terminal differences between the two forms can explain the molecular mass heterogeneity detected by mass spectrometer analysis. The PtK2 derived from prothrombin also showed anti-endothelial cell proliferative activity as the angiogenic inhibitor purified from rabbit serum. These results indicate that the angiogenic inhibitor is the same molecule as the PtK2. We examined the anti-recombinant PtK2 antibody specificity by immunoprecipitation. The antibody reacted not only with prothrombin but also with the kringle-2 domain containing prothrombin derivatives such as prethrombin. However, the antibody did not react with the kringle 1 domain or thrombin (Fig. 6 A). Both the kringle 2 domain purified from factor Xa-treated rabbit prothrombin and the recombinant PtK2 showed similar binding affinity to the anti-PtK2 antibody (Fig. 6 B). However, the antibodies did not react with rabbit plasminogen, angiostatin, or the kringle-5 domain by immunoblot analysis (Fig. 6 D). Although very weak bands were detected on plasminogen and angiostatin, these bands were thought to be nonspecific, because bands of the same intensity were also found in the blot that incubated with the control sera. We produced recombinant rabbit PtK2 in an E. coliexpression system. Using DEAE-Sephacel chromatography and Sephacryl S-200 chromatography, the recombinant PtK2 was purified to apparent homogeneity from E. coli crude extracts (Fig. 5, lane D). The purified rPtK2 exerted a growth inhibitory effect on bFGF-stimulated BCE cells, and the effect was blocked by an antibody against recombinant PtK2 (Fig. 7 A). Also, the activity of rPtK2 for BCE cells was diminished after reduction and alkylation of the protein (Fig. 7 C). This result indicates that PtK2 requires appropriate folding by intrachain disulfide bonds to display its inhibitory activity. The anti-endothelial cell proliferative activity of rPtK2 was also compared with that of pPtK2 (proteolytic PtK2 isolated from factor Xa-treated prothrombin). As shown in Fig. 8, the concentrations of half-maximal inhibition (ED50) for rPtK2 and pPtK2 are about 2 μg/ml and 4 μg/ml, respectively. Although the activity of rPtK2 is two times that of pPtK2, this result suggests the folding of recombinant PtK2 might be similar to PtK2 in prothrombin.Figure 8Comparison of endothelial cell growth inhibitory activity of PtK2 with human angiostatin. rPtK2 (■), proteolytic PtK2 purified from factor Xa-treated rabbit prothrombin (pPtK2, ▵), and human proteolytic angiostatin (hK1–4, ♦) were assayed on BCE cells in the presence of 1 ng/ml bFGF in a 72-h proliferation experiment.

The antitumor drug bleomycin produces exclusively OAS in the form of C-4-keto-C-1-aldehydes in unbroken DNA strands and 3′-phosphoglycolate esters terminating strand breaks. We investigated whether two human DNA repair enzymes can mediate OAS excision in vitro: Ape1 protein (the main human abasic endonuclease (also called Hap1, Apex, or Ref1)) and DNA polymerase β, which carries out both the abasic excision and the resynthesis steps. We used a duplex oligonucleotide substrate with one main target for bleomycin-induced damage. Ape1 catalyzed effective incision at the C-4-keto-C-1-aldehyde sites at a rate that may be only a few-fold lower than incision of hydrolytic abasic sites at the same location. Consistent with several previous studies, Ape1 hydrolyzed 3′-phosphoglycolates 25-fold more slowly than C-4-keto-C-1-aldehydes. DNA polymerase β excised the 5′-terminal OAS formed by Ape1 incision at a rate similar to its removal of unmodified abasic residues. Polymerase β-mediated excision of 5′-terminal OAS was stimulated by Ape1 as it is for unmodified abasic sites. Escherichia coli Fpg (MutM) protein also excised 5′-terminal OAS, but in our hands, the RecJ protein did not. These observations help define mammalian pathways of OAS repair, point to interactions that might coordinate functional steps, and suggest that still unknown factors may contribute to removal of 3′-phosphoglycolate esters.

Under physiological conditions, the human genome is continuously damaged by hydrolysis; reactive metabolic by-products, such as oxygen radicals; exogenous agents that penetrate cells; and radiation (1Lindahl T.

The tremendous sizes of chromosomal DNA molecules render them susceptible to even infrequent events that covalently alter their structure. For example, all of the hydrogen atoms of DNA deoxyribose can potentially be abstracted by free radicals. Four of the seven sugar hydrogens in B-form duplex DNA, i.e. C-1′-H, C-2′-H(R), C-4′-H, and C-5′-H(S) are exposed to free radicals through the minor groove and the others through the major groove (3Blackburn G.M.

Such oxidized abasic sites (OAS)1 may comprise up to one-third of total oxidative damage (2Demple B. Harrison L. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1994; 63: 915-948Crossref PubMed Scopus (1300) Google Scholar, 10Von Sonntag C. The Chemical Basis of Radiation Biology. Taylor and Francis, London1987Google Scholar). It is expected that the abasic sites and DNA fragmentation resulting from oxidative agents would block DNA replication and be cytotoxic or mutagenic (1Lindahl T. Nature. 1993; 362: 709-715Crossref PubMed Scopus (4378) Google Scholar, 2Demple B. Harrison L. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1994; 63: 915-948Crossref PubMed Scopus (1300) Google Scholar). However, little is known about the biochemistry of repair of these naturally occurring and environmentally induced lesions that may threaten genetic stability. Genetic instability can be counteracted by various pathways of DNA repair (1Lindahl T. Nature. 1993; 362: 709-715Crossref PubMed Scopus (4378) Google Scholar, 2Demple B. Harrison L. Annu. Rev.

Base excision repair (2Demple B. Harrison L. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1994; 63: 915-948Crossref PubMed Scopus (1300) Google Scholar) handles altered bases through the action of DNA glycosylases that produce apurinic/apyrimidinic (AP) sites. The AP sites generated by glycosylases can be incised at the 5′-side by a number of AP endonucleases, such as the mammalian Ape1 protein (13Demple B. Herman T. Chen D.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 11450-11454Crossref PubMed Scopus (478) Google Scholar). Ape1 protein 2We have modified the previous name for this protein by adding a number, which will accommodate naming of new enzymes of this type. Accordingly, the gene should be calledAPE1.

Ape1 has a broad specificity for AP sites and incises them to generate a 3′-OH and a 5′-terminal deoxyribose-5-phosphate (5′-dRp) residue (17Rothwell, D. G., and Hickson, I.

The resulting 5′-dRp can be removed by an intrinsic activity of human DNA polymerase β (Polβ) (20Matsumoto Y. Kim K.

Harrison L. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1994; 63: 915-948Crossref PubMed Scopus (1300) Google Scholar). Recently, human Ape1 protein and Polβ were found to act in an orchestrated manner mediated by protein-protein interactions (22Bennett R.A.O. Wilson D.W., III Wong D. Demple B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 7166-7169Crossref PubMed Scopus (327) Google Scholar). An alternative base excision repair pathway is used when strand displacement repair synthesis generates a single-stranded 5′-end that must be removed by a “FLAP” endonuclease (23Klungland A. Lindahl T. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 3341-3348Crossref PubMed Scopus (666) Google Scholar). The C-4′ oxidized deoxyribose damage initiated by bleomycin is a mixture of oxidized abasic lesions and strand breaks (6Absalon M.J. Kozarich J.W. Stubbe J.

Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 2076-2086Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar) that the activated bleomycin, after binding into the DNA minor groove, position-specifically abstracts a hydrogen atom from the C-4′ position of the deoxyribose of the pyrimidine (Py) in a d(GpPy) sequence to initiate the degradation process. One pathway (Fig. 1, lower branch) leads to the formation of a C-4′-hydroxylated abasic site (2-deoxypentose-4-ulose), which can be chemically cleaved by hydrazine treatment to form a strand break with a 3′-pyridazine (25Sugiyama H. Kawabata H. Fujiwara T. Dannoue Y. Saito I. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1990; 112: 5252-5257Crossref Scopus (52) Google Scholar). Strand breaks with 3′-phosphoglycolate (3′-PG) can be generated directly (Fig. 1,upper branch) with the concomitant release of base-propenal. Although the mechanisms are different, C-4′ hydrogen abstraction by enediyne antitumor antibiotics, such as neocarzinostatin (8Goldberg I.H. Kappen L.S. Xu Y.J. Stassinopoulos A. Zeng X. Xi Z.

Biochemistry. 1995; 36: 14975-14984Crossref Scopus (39) Google Scholar), results in the same DNA damage products in either the presence or the absence of thiols. Since C-4′-oxidized abasic sites constitute as much as 10% of the damage formed by ionizing radiation (10Von Sonntag C. The Chemical Basis of Radiation Biology. Taylor and Francis, London1987Google Scholar), they are also likely to be significant products of the chemical oxidation that occurs in vivoas a by-product of aerobic metabolism (2Demple B. Harrison L. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1994; 63: 915-948Crossref PubMed Scopus (1300) Google Scholar). Here we address whether these C-4′-oxidized damage products can be enzymatically excised in vitro and investigate the efficiency with which these products are processed by known enzymes. We have designed a fragment of duplex DNA (Fig. 2, duplex D1·D2) that contains one predominant attack site for bleomycin, which exhibits a limited sequence dependence for its reactions (6Absalon M.J. Kozarich J.W. Stubbe J. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 2056-2075Google Scholar, 7Absalon M.J. Wu W. Stubbe J. Kozarich J.W. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 2076-2086Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar). The results show that the C-4′-oxidized abasic residues are readily excised by the human enzymes and confirm that 3′-PG lesions are poor substrates for excision by Ape1, consistent with previous studies of randomly introduced 3′-PG lesions (see “Discussion”). As they do acting on hydrolytic AP sites, Ape1 and Polβ can work cooperatively in the excision of OAS. High pressure liquid chromatography-purified DNA oligonucleotides were commercial products from Operon Technologies (Alameda, CA). Radiolabeled nucleotides and the enzymes used for labeling were from NEN Life Science Products and New England Biolabs, Inc. (Beverly, MA), respectively. Bleomycin (1.2–1.7 units/mg) was purchased from Sigma. Recombinant human Ape1 protein expressed in E. coli was purified (>95% homogeneity as judged by silver staining of polyacrylamide-SDS gels) as described by Wilson et al. (19Wilson D.M., III Takeshita M. Grollman A.P. Demple B. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 16002-16007Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (245) Google Scholar). Endonuclease IV (Endo IV) was purified (>98% purity) by D. M. Wilson III using a method described previously (28Levin J.D. Demple B. Nucleic Acids Res. 1996; 24: 885-889Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). Recombinant human Polβ protein was purified by R. A. O. Bennett as described previously (22Bennett R.A.O. Wilson D.W., III Wong D. Demple B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 7166-7169Crossref PubMed Scopus (327) Google Scholar) using an expression vector generously provided by Drs. J. Carney and S. Linn (University of California, Berkeley). E. coli uracil-DNA glycosylase and Fpg protein were kindly provided by Dr. D. Mosbaugh (Oregon State University) and Dr. A. Grollman (State University of New York, Stony Brook), respectively. Single-stranded DNA oligomers were end-labeled with 32P at the 5′ termini with [γ-32P]ATP and T4 polynucleotide kinase (29Ausubel F.M. Brent R. Kingston R.E. Moore D.D. Seidman J.G. Smith J.A. Struhl K. Current Protocols in Molecular Biology. John Wiley & Sons, New York1989: 3.4.1-3.10.5Google Scholar) and annealed to the complementary strands. For 3′-end labeling, the oligonucleotides were first annealed and then incubated with [α-32P]dATP (for D1 and D3) or [α-32P]dCTP (for D2) and the Klenow fragment of E. coli DNA polymerase I (29Ausubel F.M. Brent R. Kingston R.E. Moore D.D. Seidman J.G. Smith J.A. Struhl K. Current Protocols in Molecular Biology. John Wiley & Sons, New York1989: 3.4.1-3.10.5Google Scholar). For 32P internal labeling, oligomer D5 (which corresponds to the 3′ half of D1; Fig. 2) was first 5′-32P-end labeled as described above and then gel-purified. Oligomer D4 (the 5′-half of D1; Fig. 2) was placed adjacent to the 5′-labeled D5 by annealing both oligonucleotides to a third oligomer, D8 (Fig. 2). The nick between D4 and D5 was sealed by T4 DNA ligase to produce an internally 32P-labeled D1.3H internal labeling at the bleomycin target site was done following the method of T. A. Winters et al. (30Winters T.A. Henner W.D. Russell P.S. McCullough A. Jorgensen T.J. Nucleic Acids Res. 1994; 22: 1866-1873Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar) with some modifications. Briefly, the deoxyribose of the target T nucleotide in D1 was labeled with 3H at the C-1′- and C-2′-positions by incubation of [methyl-1′,2′-3H]dTTP and duplex D4·D6 with the Klenow fragment of DNA polymerase I in the presence of dGTP and dATP. Similarly, the C-5′-position was labeled with 3H by incubation of [5,5′-3H]dCTP with Klenow fragment in the presence of duplex D4·D7, dGTP, and dATP. The internally 3H-labeled D4 oligonucleotide was then gel-purified and annealed to oligonucleotide D8 (Fig. 2). The 3′ portion of D1 was then synthesized by Klenow fragment in the presence of all four dNTPs. When [5,5′-3H]dCTP was incorporated, which substitutes the target T nucleotide on D1, a complementary strand containing a G on the opposite position was annealed. The DNA duplex with C replacing T is still expected to provide a good target for bleomycin reaction, but more double-stranded lesions are expected to be generated (24Povirk L.F. Han Y.H. Steighner R.J. Biochemistry. 1989; 28: 5808-5814Crossref PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar). However, these double-stranded lesions should not interfere with the analysis conducted here. All labeled oligonucleotides were purified using electrophoresis in denaturing polyacrylamide gels (National Diagnostics) and then annealed to their complementary strands at a molar ratio of 1:1. Bleomycin reactions with DNA were carried out according to published protocols (6Absalon M.J. Kozarich J.W. Stubbe J. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 2056-2075Google Scholar, 7Absalon M.J. Wu W. Stubbe J. Kozarich J.W. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 2076-2086Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar, 24Povirk L.F. Han Y.H. Steighner R.J. Biochemistry. 1989; 28: 5808-5814Crossref PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar). In brief, bleomycin was first mixed with an equal amount of ferrous ammonium sulfate at 4 °C for exactly 1 min to make “activated bleomycin.” The activated bleomycin was then added to the annealed DNA oligonucleotides in Hepes-KOH buffer (50 mm, pH 7.8) containing 50 mm NaCl to initiate the drug-DNA reactions (6Absalon M.J. Kozarich J.W. Stubbe J. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 2056-2075Google Scholar, 7Absalon M.J. Wu W. Stubbe J. Kozarich J.W. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 2076-2086Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar). Alternatively, the drug-DNA reactions were started by adding ferrous ammonium sulfate to a mixture of DNA and bleomycin (24Povirk L.F. Han Y.H. Steighner R.J. Biochemistry. 1989; 28: 5808-5814Crossref PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar). The reactions were allowed to proceed for 1–2 h at room temperature and then stopped by the addition of sodium acetate to 0.3 m(from a pH 7.0 stock) and ethanol precipitation or by washing with 20 volumes of 5 mm Hepes-KOH buffer (pH 7.6) in an ultrafiltration apparatus (Centricon 10, Amicon, Beverly, MA). These procedures remove most of the free bleomycin. The freshly prepared, bleomycin-treated DNA substrates (0.25 μm final concentration) with position-specific, C-4′-oxidized deoxyribose lesions were incubated with the indicated amounts of Ape1, Endo IV, Fpg, or Polβ protein in 50 mm Hepes-KOH buffer (pH 7.6) containing different enzyme-specific components. For Ape1 reactions, 50 mm KCl, 100 μg/ml BSA, 0.05% Triton X-100, and 10 mm MgCl2 were included (18Chen D.S. Herman T. Demple B. Nucleic Acids Res. 1991; 19: 5907-5914Crossref PubMed Scopus (230) Google Scholar). The Endo IV reactions contained 50 mm KCl, 50 μg/ml BSA, and 1 mm EDTA (28Levin J.D. Demple B. Nucleic Acids Res. 1996; 24: 885-889Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). The Ape1 or Endo IV reactions were stopped by flash freezing and drying in a Speed-Vac concentrator or further incubated with Fpg or Polβ in Hepes-KOH buffer containing 2 mm dithiothreitol, 50 mm NaCl, 2.5% glycerol, and 100 μg/ml BSA (22Bennett R.A.O. Wilson D.W., III Wong D. Demple B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 7166-7169Crossref PubMed Scopus (327) Google Scholar). The repair enzyme reactions were assembled at 0–4 °C and incubated at room temperature. In order to stabilize the C-4′-oxidized abasic sites and unexcised 5′-dRp, Polβ reaction mixtures were terminated by treatment with 300 mmNaBH4 for 1 h at room temperature. The DNA samples were then precipitated in ice-cold 75% ethanol containing 0.3m sodium acetate and pelleted by centrifugation. After the DNA-bleomycin or DNA-enzyme reactions, the samples were either directly frozen and dried in a Speed-Vac concentrator or precipitated with ethanol and pelleted by centrifugation. The DNA samples were then taken up in a loading buffer containing 80% formamide and dyes, and then separated on 15 or 20% polyacrylamide sequencing gels as described previously (27Xu Y.J. Xi Z. Zhen Y.S. Goldberg I.H. Biochemistry. 1995; 36: 14975-14984Crossref Scopus (39) Google Scholar). The gels were visualized by autoradiography, and the intensities of the bands were quantitated using a phosphor imager (Bio-Rad). When needed, the bands were excised, the materials inside the gel slices were eluted with distilled H2O, and the amount of radioactivity was determined by liquid scintillation using an LS 1801 counter (Beckman Instruments, Fullerton, CA). Based on the reported sequence specificity of bleomycin (6Absalon M.J. Kozarich J.W. Stubbe J. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 2056-2075Google Scholar, 7Absalon M.J. Wu W. Stubbe J. Kozarich J.W. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 2076-2086Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar, 24Povirk L.F. Han Y.H. Steighner R.J. Biochemistry. 1989; 28: 5808-5814Crossref PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar), a 36-mer DNA oligonucleotide was designed and 5′-32P-end-labeled forin vitro studies. When this duplex DNA fragment (duplex of oligomers D1 and D2; Fig. 2) was reacted with different amounts of bleomycin, one major damage site was found on strand D1 (Fig. 3, lanes 4–9) and two minor sites on D2 (lanes 13–18), respectively. The band in Fig. 3, lane 4 (indicated by an arrow) that moves slightly faster than the Maxam-Gilbert “T” sequencing marker corresponds to a DNA fragment bearing a 3′-PG terminus, which is diagnostic for C-4′ chemistry (27Xu Y.J. Xi Z. Zhen Y.S. Goldberg I.H. Biochemistry. 1995; 36: 14975-14984Crossref Scopus (39) Google Scholar). To reveal additional OAS, samples were treated with hydrazine, which specifically cleaves C-4′-oxidized abasic sites to generate strand breaks terminated with 3′-pyridazine (Fig. 1). As shown in Fig. 3, lane 5, the band (marked by anasterisk) that was generated by hydrazine treatment and moves more slowly than the “T” sequencing marker corresponds to a DNA cleavage product containing a 3′-pyridazine terminus (27Xu Y.J. Xi Z. Zhen Y.S. Goldberg I.H. Biochemistry. 1995; 36: 14975-14984Crossref Scopus (39) Google Scholar). Such a band was not observed without bleomycin treatment (Fig. 3,lanes 2 and 11). Quantitation by phosphor imaging of the bleomycin damage products showed that, under our conditions, C-4′-oxidized abasic sites and direct strand breaks (3′-PG) were generated at a ratio of ∼1.5:1. Comparison of lanes 5 and 14 of Fig. 3 shows that, when almost all of the D1 strand had been modified, 35% of oligomer D2 remained without detectable bleomycin damage. Thus, the central T nucleotide within oligonucleotide D1 was indeed the major site for bleomycin attack in this DNA fragment. However, we also note that, at the highest level of bleomycin treatment, considerable damage at secondary sites was observed, which was accompanied by some loss of material from the gel analysis. Therefore, to ensure that the bleomycin-treated DNA fragments prepared for later enzymatic treatment would contain only one damaged nucleotide, the extent of damage in the D1 oligomer was limited to 5–7% of the total D1 oligomer by using bleomycin concentrations of 3–5 μm. The abundance of Ape1 protein in human cells (13Demple B. Herman T. Chen D.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 11450-11454Crossref PubMed Scopus (478) Google Scholar, 18Chen D.S. Herman T. Demple B. Nucleic Acids Res. 1991; 19: 5907-5914Crossref PubMed Scopus (230) Google Scholar) and its ability to cleave DNA at diverse types of abasic sites (19Wilson D.M., III Takeshita M. Grollman A.P. Demple B. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 16002-16007Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (245) Google Scholar) prompted us to test the enzyme's ability to act on OAS. Incubation of the bleomycin-treated, 5′-labeled D1·D2 duplex with Ape1 initially generated a single cleavage product (band labeled b in Fig. 4), which remained as the main product at the highest level of enzyme treatment (Fig. 4, lane 6). For comparison, the 5′-labeled D2·D3 DNA duplex, treated with uracil-DNA glycosylase to generate a single AP site, was cleaved by Ape1 protein to generate a single product of the same mobility (Fig. 4, lanes 7–10). As expected, the mobility of this product (faster than the G (not shown) and slower than the T Maxam-Gilbert markers with 3′-phosphate ends generated by piperidine treatment) was consistent with cleavage by Ape1 at the single AP site to form a DNA fragment containing a 3′-OH end. Thus, Ape1 cleaves C-4′-oxidized abasic lesions in the same way. Because only some of the DNA in the bleomycin-treated samples contained OAS at the target site, and allowing for possible inhibitory effects of other damage in these samples, we cannot make an accurate quantitative comparison of Ape1 activity on C-4′-oxidizedversus hydrolytic abasic sites. However, we note that 54 nm Ape1 acting on C-4′-oxidized abasic sites generated product at ≥10% of the amount generated from hydrolytic abasic sites (Fig. 4, lane 5 versus lane 10). Since other lesions in the bleomycin-treated DNA probably compete for Ape1 with the C-4′-oxidized abasic residues at the target site, the relative efficiency of the enzyme on this type of OAS may be within a few-fold of the activity on regular AP sites. Lane 3 of Fig. 4 shows the direct cleavage product of bleomycin acting on the 5′-labeled D1·D2 duplex to generate a strand break with 3′-PG (indicated by an arrow). Incubation with increasing amounts of Ape1 protein led to the disappearance of the 3′-PG band, with nearly complete excision at the highest Ape1 level (Fig. 4, lane 6).Band b contains the common product of Ape1 3′-PG excision and abasic site incision activities. However, at an intermediate Ape1 concentration, most of the 3′-PG substrate remained intact in the same sample in which there was extensive incision at the C-4′-oxidized abasic site (Fig. 4, lane 5). This result suggested that Ape1 acts more readily on the intact abasic residues formed by bleomycin than it does on the 3′-PG sites, and this conclusion was verified by a kinetic analysis (see below). The same products were formed by Endo IV (Fig. 4, lanes 11–14), in keeping with earlier reports of this enzyme's activity upon bleomycin cleavage (28Levin J.D. Demple B. Nucleic Acids Res. 1996; 24: 885-889Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar, 31Häring M. Rüdiger H. Demple B. Boiteux S. Epe B. Nucleic Acids Res. 1994; 22: 2010-2015Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar). However, Endo IV excised 3′-PG as efficiently as it incised C-4′-oxidized abasic sites (comparelanes 12 and 13 of Fig. 4). In addition, the action of the bacterial enzyme on the OAS was nearly as robust as its activity on hydrolytic AP sites (see lanes 15–18 of Fig. 4). Band c in Fig. 4 is probably generated by a trace amount of contaminating exonuclease in this particular Endo IV preparation (data not shown). To verify the incision sites of Ape1 and Endo IV at bleomycin damages, the D1 oligomer was annealed with D2 and 32P-labeled at its 3′-end before treatment with bleomycin. Ape1 or Endo IV treatment of the 3′-labeled substrate generated a single cleavage product (Fig. 5, lanes 2 and 7, labeled with an asterisk) of slower mobility than the 5′-phosphate produced by the direct action of bleomycin (arrow in Fig. 5). The slower mobility of this product is consistent with the presence of an abasic residue at the 5′ terminus. Thus, Ape1 protein recognizes and incises the C-4′-oxidized abasic residues on their immediate 5′ side. Ape1 protein can remove 3′-PG residues from DNA single-stranded breaks, one-base gaps, and from double-stranded breaks with either blunt or two-base recessed 3′-termini (Refs. 30Winters T.A. Henner W.D. Russell P.S. McCullough A. Jorgensen T.J. Nucleic Acids Res. 1994; 22: 1866-1873Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar and 32Suh D. Wilson D.M., III Povirk L.F. Nucleic Acids Res. 1997; 25: 2495-2500Crossref PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar and this work). Since we found that Ape1 can also incise on the 5′ side of C-4′-oxidized abasic sites, it was of interest to compare the excision and incision activities of Ape1 in the same reaction system. For this purpose, oligomers were32P-labeled at either the 5′-end or internally in the phosphodiester at the immediate 5′ side of the target T nucleotide in sequence D1 (Fig. 2). With the internal-labeled oligomers, the DNA fragments with 3′-PG residues (direct damage products) and the fragments with 5′-terminal oxidized abasic residues (Ape1 dependent products) can be well separated as two bands on 15% sequencing gels (see Fig. 7). Quantitation by phosphor imaging showed that the incision activity of"

Leishmania are important human pathogens (1Lainson R. Shaw J.J. Nature. 1978; 273: 595-600Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar) whose life cycle involves transmission of an extracellular flagellate (promastigote) from the alimentary tract of a sandfly vector to a mammalian host, where the parasite multiplies intracellularly in macrophages as an aflagellate (amastigote) (2Wyler D.J. Modern Parasite Biology. W. H. Freeman and Co., New York1990Google Scholar). The pronounced biological changes that occur during the life cycle underscore the importance of developmental regulation of gene expression to parasite survival in these contrasting and hostile environments. Yet, the mechanisms responsible for regulation of gene expression in Leishmania and related kinetoplastid protozoa have not been extensively studied. To probe the mechanisms controlling gene expression during the parasite life cycle, we are studying a family of glucose transporters that contains both developmentally regulated and constitutively expressed members. Metabolism of glucose is of considerable interest in these parasites since it provides a major source of energy to the promastigote (3Blum J.J. Parasitol. Today. 1993; 9: 118-122Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar), and it involves some novel biochemical features such as specialized membrane-bound organelles called glycosomes (4Opperdoes F.R. Annu. Rev. Microbiol. 1987; 41: 127-151Crossref PubMed Scopus (429) Google Scholar) that contain many of the glycolytic enzymes. In Leishmania species, the permeases for glucose are structurally related to the 12 transmembrane-spanning mammalian facilitative glucose transporters (5Cairns B.R. Collard M.W. Landfear S.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1989; 86: 7682-7686Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar, 6Langford C.K. Ewbank S.A. Hanson S.A. Ullman B. Landfear S.M. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 1992; 55: 51-64Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). Previous studies with Leishmania enriettii (5Cairns B.R. Collard M.W. Landfear S.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1989; 86: 7682-7686Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar) have shown that the mRNAs encoding these glucose transporters are present at relatively abundant levels in promastigotes but are dramatically down-regulated in amastigotes. Down-regulation of glucose transporter expression in the amastigote presumably reflects the lower glucose concentration that the parasite encounters in the macrophage. Indeed, Leishmaniaamastigotes transport much less glucose than promastigotes (7Burchmore R.J.S. Hart D.T. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 1995; 74: 77-86Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar) and derive metabolic energy primarily from fatty acid oxidation (8Hart D.T. Coombs G.H. Exp. Parasitol. 1982; 54: 397-409Crossref PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar). Thus, the glucose transporter genes encode proteins that are likely to play an important role in parasite life cycle adaptation, and they present an attractive model in which to address the molecular mechanisms of gene regulation during the parasite life cycle. However, the study of developmentally regulated gene expression in Leishmania has been hampered by the inherent difficulty in obtaining substantial numbers of viable, pure amastigotes. Furthermore, experiments involving expression of wild-type or altered genes from extrachromosomal expression vectors (9LeBowitz J.H. Coburn C.M. McMahon-Pratt D. Beverley S.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 9736-9740Crossref PubMed Scopus (191) Google Scholar) are impractical in intracellular amastigotes, since transfected parasites would have to be cultured in the presence of selective drugs, such as neomycin or hygromycin, which are toxic to the host macrophages. One way to overcome the technical difficulties of studying gene expression in amastigotes is to use axenically cultured amastigotes as a model system (10Doyle P.S. Engel J.C. Pimenta P.F.P. Pinto da Silva P. Dwyer D.M. Exp. Parasitol. 1991; 73: 326-334Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar, 11Pan A.A. Duboise S.M. Eperon S. Rivas L. Hodgkinson V. Traub-Cseko Y. McMahon-Pratt D. J.

Parasitol. 1991; 49: 111-118Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). Leishmania mexicana is one species that can be grown in axenic culture and exhibits many of the morphological and biochemical properties of intracellular amastigotes (13Bates P.A. Robertson C.D. Tetley L. Coombs G.H. Parasitology. 1992; 105: 193-202Crossref PubMed Scopus (180) Google Scholar). To study the developmentally regulated expression of glucose transporter genes in this axenic model system, we have cloned glucose transporter genes fromL. mexicana. Mapping and sequencing of genomic clones encoding these transporters (referred to hereafter asLmGT 1 genes, indicating their identity as L. mexicana glucose transporters) demonstrate that there are three genes that encode three distinct isoforms of this permease, LmGT1, LmGT2, and LmGT3.LmGT2 mRNA is strongly regulated during the parasite life cycle, since it is present at a ∼15-fold higher level in promastigotes compared with amastigotes. In contrast, the less abundantLmGT1 and LmGT3 mRNAs are present at similar levels in both life cycle stages. Transcription of the LmGTgenes is constitutive in promastigotes and axenic amastigotes; consequently, expression of LmGT2 is post-transcriptionally regulated. Measurement of LmGT2mRNA half-life suggests a role for differential mRNA turnover in the control of glucose transporter gene expression during the parasite life cycle. These results underscore the importance of post-transcriptional regulatory mechanisms in Leishmaniaparasites and also reveal for the first time the existence of both developmentally regulated and constitutively expressed glucose transporters in the genus. L. mexicana promastigotes (WHO reference strain M379) were grown at 26 °C in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium-L (14Iovannisci D.M. Ullman B. J. Parasitol. 1983; 69: 633-636Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar) containing 10% heat-inactivated fetal calf serum. Axenic amastigotes were grown in a simplified version of JH-30 medium (15Pan A. Exp. Parasitol. 1984; 58: 72-80Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar), developed by Dr. David Russell (Washington University, St. Louis) and designated JH-30A, consisting of M199 (11 g·liter−1), glucose (2.5 g·liter−1), trypticase (5 g·liter−1),l-glutamine (0.75 g·liter−1), HEPES (5.96 g·liter−1), NaHCO3 (2.2 g·liter−1), and hemin (20 mg·liter−1). The pH was adjusted to 6.0 with HCl. Axenic amastigotes were transformed from mid-log phase promastigote cultures by dilution into an equal volume of JH-30A medium, containing either 20% heat-inactivated fetal bovine serum or 20% bovine embryonic fluid, followed by incubation at 32.5 °C. Continuous cultures were maintained at 32.5 °C by periodic dilution with JH-30A containing serum or embryonic fluid. In vivo amastigotes were grown in a macrophage-like cell line, J774.G8 (16Chang K.-P. Science. 1980; 209: 1240-1242Crossref PubMed Scopus (169) Google Scholar). J774.G8 cells were maintained in RPMI 1640 growth medium supplemented with 20 mm HEPES buffer, 2 mml-glutamine, and 20% heat-inactivated fetal calf serum, at 35 °C in a humidified atmosphere containing 5% CO2. When monolayers of J774.G8 were confluent, they were infected with early stationary phase promastigotes at a ratio of 50 parasites per host cell. Infected monolayers were incubated for 12–24 h at 32.5 °C before unincorporated parasites were removed by washing and replacing the growth medium. After incubation for an additional 24 h, monolayers were washed twice with ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline, pH 7.3 and detached by scraping. J774.G8 cells were lysed by repeated passage through a 30-gauge needle, and the amastigotes were purified by Percoll density gradient centrifugation (16Chang K.-P. Science. 1980; 209: 1240-1242Crossref PubMed Scopus (169) Google Scholar). Isolation of genomic DNA and preparation of Southern and Northern blots were performed as described (17Landfear S.M. McMahon-Pratt D. Wirth D.F. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1983; 3: 1070-1076Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). Total RNA was prepared as reported (18Chomczynski P. Sacchi N. Anal. Biochem. 1987; 162: 156-159Crossref PubMed Scopus (63232) Google Scholar). The phage library of EcoRI-digested L. mexicana genomic DNA in the Lambda DASH II vector (Stratagene) was prepared according to protocols supplied by the manufacturer, and screening, isolation, and subcloning were performed by standard protocols (19Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. 2nd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar). DNA sequences were obtained from the two KpnI fragments and the twoKpnI/EcoRI fragments, which together span theLmGT locus (Fig. 1 B) using an ABI 373 automated sequencer (Perkin Elmer). Protein-coding regions and 5′-UTRs were sequenced completely on both strands, whereas only partial sequence was obtained for 3′-UTRs and intergenic regions. DNA sequences of cloned PCR products and from other genomic clones derived from theLmGT locus were obtained using the Sequitherm EXCEL DNA sequencing kit (Epicentre Technologies Inc.). Comparisons of the LmGT-predicted protein sequences to protein sequences in the GenBank data base were performed using the FASTA algorithm (20Pearson W.R. Lipman D.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1988; 85: 2444-2448Crossref PubMed Scopus (9393) Google Scholar). Predicted membrane-spanning domains were determined using the Eisenberg algorithm (21Eisenberg D. Schwarz E. Komaromy M. Wall R. J. Mol. Biol. 1984; 179: 125-142Crossref PubMed Scopus (1717) Google Scholar). Reverse transcription of total promastigote RNA and PCR amplification of resulting cDNA was performed as described previously (6Langford C.K. Ewbank S.A. Hanson S.A. Ullman B. Landfear S.M. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 1992; 55: 51-64Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). The forward primer was the 39-nucleotide sequence of the spliced leader from Leishmania donovani (22Wilson K. Hanson S. Landfear S. Ullman B. Nucleic Acids Res. 1991; 19: 5787Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). Gene-specific reverse primers were the reverse complement of the nucleotide sequences encoding divergent regions within the NH2 terminus of the putative protein-coding regions forLmGT1, LmGT2, and LmGT3. Thus, the reverse primers were 5′-ATAGCTCCTTATTTGGGGATATAGACTCC-3′ (LmGT1), 5′-GCTGCAGGATCCCGTGAATGGGCTCCTTTTCGGACCTAGAGC-3′ (LmGT2), and 5′-GCTGCAGGATCCCGTGCCGCTCCTCGGACAACCAGTTCGAGC-3′ (LmGT3), where the underlined nucleotides represent aBamHI site introduced to facilitate subcloning of the PCR products. Amplification products were either digested withBamHI and subcloned into the BamHI site of the plasmid vector pBluescript (Stratagene) or they were subcloned directly into the pGEMT vector (Stratagene), and the nucleotide sequence was determined to reveal the site for spliced leader addition. Since the sequence encoding the COOH-terminal region of the LmGT3 isoform was not contained within the ∼14-kb genomic EcoRI fragment obtained from the genomic library (Fig. 1 B), this region of the LmGT3 gene was obtained by PCR amplification of cDNA. Reverse transcription of total promastigote RNA was performed as described previously (6Langford C.K. Ewbank S.A. Hanson S.A. Ullman B. Landfear S.M. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 1992; 55: 51-64Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar), using the following oligonucleotide designed to prime from the poly(A) tail: 5′-GGCCGGATCCGAATTCTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTT-3′. Two consecutive PCRs were performed, both using the above oligonucleotide as a reverse primer. The first 13 nucleotides in this primer provided an “anchor” that facilitated performing the PCR at a higher annealing temperature than is possible using oligo(dT) alone. The forward primer for the first reaction, primed with cDNA, was 21 nucleotides from the sequence that encodes the predicted hydrophilic loop between transmembrane segments 10 and 11, identical in all threeLmGT genes (primer 1, Fig. 1 B: 5′-CTGGACTGACCGCGAGAGGCGC-3′). The forward primer for the second reaction, templated with a small aliquot of the product from the first reaction, was the 21 nucleotides upstream of the 3′ end of theEcoRI site near the predicted COOH terminus of LmGT3 (primer 2, Fig. 1 B: 5′-AGGGAGCTGAGCGGGGAATTC-3′). This primer is specific for LmGT3. The product of this PCR, called PCR1, was sequenced directly to obtain the sequence of the COOH terminus (the last six amino acids) and part of the 3′-UTR of the LmGT3gene. The observation that PCR1 is only 1.8 kb, whereasLmGT3 mRNA is 7.5 kb long and hence contains a 3′-UTR of almost 6 kb, indicates that the oligo(dT)-containing primer described above that was used to template cDNA synthesis did not actually prime from the poly(A) tail but initiated synthesis at an internal site within the 3′-UTR. To confirm that this PCR product represented a sequence that was contiguous with the rest of the LmGT3 gene, PCR was exploited to amplify from cDNA the sequences flanking theEcoRI site within the predicted COOH terminus of LmGT3. The forward primer was the oligonucleotide used in the first reaction above (primer 1) and contained within the body of the LmGT3 coding region, whereas the reverse primer was the reverse complement of the nucleotide sequence ∼200–220 nucleotides downstream of the putative translation stop for LmGT3 (primer 3, Fig. 1 B: 5′-AAAGGCGAAAGCCAACGGAGTG-3′), obtained from the sequence of PCR1. Sequence analysis of this second PCR product, PCR2, confirmed that the body of the LmGT3 protein-coding region was linked to the COOH-terminal coding region originally obtained by sequencing PCR1. The LmGT coding region probe used for detection of RNAs on Northern blots (Fig. 4 A) was an antisense RNA of ∼1.2 kb, derived from cloned DNA between the BglII site upstream of the LmGT2 open reading frame and thePstI site within the LmGT2 open reading frame (Fig. 1 B). The LmGT1 probe (Fig. 4 B) was a DNA probe of ∼1.2 kb, encompassing sequence from aSmaI site ∼1 kb downstream of the LmGT1 open reading frame to the KpnI site ∼2.2 kb downstream of theLmGT1 open reading frame (Fig. 1 B). TheLmGT2 probe (Fig. 4 C) was an antisense RNA of ∼1.4 kb, derived from cloned DNA between the ScaI site at the downstream end of the LmGT2 open reading frame and aSmaI site ∼200 base pairs downstream of theKpnI site in the intergenic region between LmGT2and LmGT3 (Fig. 1 B). The LmGT3 probe (Fig. 4 D) was an antisense RNA of ∼1.8 kb, derived from the cloned product of PCR1 (see above). Crude nuclei were prepared from promastigotes and axenically cultured amastigotes by detergent lysis (23Kooter J.M. Borst P. Nucleic Acids Res. 1984; 12: 9457-9472Crossref PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar). Cells were harvested by centrifugation and washed twice in ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline. Approximately 5 × 108 cells were resuspended in 4 ml of lysis buffer (10 mm Tris-Cl, pH 7.4, 10 mm NaCl, 3 mm MgCl2, 0.5% (v/v) Nonidet P-40) and vortexed gently for 10 s before incubation for 5 min on ice. Lysates were centrifuged for 5 min at 500 × g at 4 °C, and the pellet was resuspended in 4 ml of lysis buffer and centrifuged again as above. The pellet was resuspended in 1 ml of storage buffer (50 mm Tris-Cl, pH 8.3, 40% glycerol, 5 mm MgCl2, 0.1 mm EDTA) and frozen in 0.1-ml aliquots in liquid nitrogen. Run-on transcription was performed using freshly thawed nuclei in a 300-μl reaction volume containing 50 mm Tris-Cl, pH 8.0, 25 mm NaCl, 2 mm dithiothreitol, 2 mm MgCl2, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 2 mm each of rATP, rCTP, and rGTP, 10 μm rUTP, 250 μCi [α-32P]rUTP at 3000 Ci mol−1 (NEN Life Science Products), 10 mmcreatine phosphate, 20 μg·μl−1 creatine phosphokinase. Nuclei were kept on ice until all reaction components were added, and then promastigote nuclei were incubated at 26 °C and amastigote nuclei at 32 °C, both for 20 min. As appropriate, α-amanitin was added to nuclei 10 min prior to other reaction components. Samples were extracted with 1 volume of phenol:chloroform (1:1), and the aqueous phase was extracted with 1 volume of chloroform. Nucleic acids were precipitated with 2 m ammonium acetate (pH 7) and 3 volumes of ethanol and centrifuged at full speed for 20 min in a microcentrifuge, with 10 μg of yeast tRNA as a carrier, rinsed twice with 70% ethanol, and resuspended in 200 μl of water. Incorporation of [α-32P]rUTP was determined by counting a 2-μl aliquot. Labeled transcripts were hybridized to slot blots of linearized, alkaline-denatured plasmid DNA (∼5 μg per slot) (23Kooter J.M. Borst P. Nucleic Acids Res. 1984; 12: 9457-9472Crossref PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar). Slot blots were prehybridized for at least 2 h at 42 °C in a sealed plastic bag containing 5 ml of 50% formamide, 5 × SSC, 50 mm NaPO4 (pH 7.0), 1% SDS, 200 μg·ml−1 yeast tRNA, 5 × Denhardt's solution, 5 mm EDTA (19Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. 2nd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar). Run-on transcripts were denatured by heating to 95 °C for 5 min and then added to the slot blot in prehybridization solution. Hybridization was allowed to proceed with gentle agitation for ∼48 h. Blots were washed at 55 °C, three times for 30 min each in 0.1 × SSC, 0.1% SDS, 5 mmEDTA, dried, and exposed to film or phosphorimage screen for a period between 12 h and 1 week. Analysis of intensity of hybridization to individual slot blots was performed using a Phosphorimager SI (Molecular Dynamics) and IP Lab Gel software for Apple Macintosh (Signal Analysis Corp.). We first determined that 9 μg·ml−1 was the IC90 for actinomycin D (Boehringer Mannheim) inhibition of [3H]uracil (NEN Life Science Products) incorporation in L. mexicana. Promastigote and amastigote cultures, at approximately 2 × 107 cells·ml−1, were incubated with 10 μg·ml−1 actinomycin D under normal culture conditions. Aliquots were removed at various time points, and nucleic acids were extracted and analyzed by Northern blot and exposure to a phosphorimage screen, as described above. ABglII-ClaI restriction fragment containing the protein-coding region of the LmGT2 gene (labeled BC in Fig. 1 B) was subcloned into the Bluescript SK+ plasmid (Stratagene), linearized with ClaI, and transcribedin vitro with T3 RNA polymerase (Life Technologies, Inc.) as described (24Langford C.K. Little B.M. Kavanaugh M.P. Landfear S.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 17939-17943Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Stage V-VI Xenopus oocytes were injected with 40 nl containing ∼3 ng of RNA, incubated for 3 days at 18 °C, and assayed for uptake of 50 μm2-deoxy-d-[3H]glucose as described previously (24Langford C.K. Little B.M. Kavanaugh M.P. Landfear S.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 17939-17943Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Lysates of promastigotes and axenic amastigotes were prepared by dissolving the cell pellet in Laemmli sample buffer (19Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. 2nd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar) at a concentration of 2.5–5 × 105cells·μl−1 and heating immediately to 65 °C for 5 min. Aliquots of the lysate were assayed in triplicate for protein content by the Bradford method (25Bradford M.M. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 72: 248-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (217544) Google Scholar). Samples (10 μl) were separated on a 10% SDS-polyacrylamide gel and electroblotted onto nitrocellulose, and the blot was incubated overnight in TBST buffer (20 mm Tris, pH 7.6, 150 mm NaCl, 0.05% Tween 20, 3% (w/v) powdered milk) containing the affinity-purified P1L antiserum directed against the large extracellular loop of the L. enriettii Pro-1 glucose transporter (26Snapp E.L. Landfear S.M. J. Cell Biol. 1997; 139: 1775-1783Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar) (1:1000 dilution). Prior to application to the blot, the P1L antiserum was preincubated for 1 h in a 200-μl volume of TBST buffer containing 50 μg of either glutathione S-transferase (GST) or the GST-fusion protein used to raise the P1L antibody. Blots were developed with a horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary goat anti-rabbit (1:40,000) IgG and the Supersignal chemiluminescence kit (Pierce) using the manufacturer's instructions and then exposed to XAR-5 film (Eastman Kodak Co.). To study expression of glucose transporter genes using the L. mexicana axenic amastigote system, we first cloned these genes from L. mexicana. Southern blots of restriction-digested L. mexicana genomic DNA, probed with a protein-coding region of the L. enriettii Pro-1 glucose transporter gene, revealed the presence of single hybridizing bands in EcoRI, HindIII, EcoRV, and BamHI digests, suggesting that most or all of theLmGT locus was contained within the ∼14-kbEcoRI fragment (Fig. 1 A). Other Southern blots revealed that there were no other smaller bands that hybridized to thePro-1 probe in genomic DNA digested with these four enzymes (data not shown). Therefore, a phage library of EcoRI-digested L. mexicana genomic DNA was screened with the L. enriettii Pro-1 probe, and 11 positive clones were isolated, all with an insert of ∼14 kb. Restriction mapping of one of these inserts revealed three restriction fragments of 5.2 kb (EcoRI/KpnI), 3.8 kb (KpnI), and 2.7 kb (KpnI/EcoRI), which hybridized with the Pro-1 probe (Fig. 1 B). Each of these restriction fragments was subcloned, partially sequenced, and found to contain a single copy of an L. mexicana Pro-1 homologue. The results indicate that this locus contains three closely related glucose transporter genes, with significant identity to L. enriettii Pro-1. The deduced amino acid sequences (Fig. 2) for these three genes indicates that they differ from each other most markedly within their predicted NH2-terminal hydrophilic domains (thought to be located on the cytoplasmic side of the membrane (27Mueckler M. Caruso C. Baldwin S.A. Panico M. Blench I. Morris H.R. Allard W.J. Lienhard G.E. Lodish H.F. Science. 1985; 229: 941-945Crossref PubMed Scopus (1149) Google Scholar)). LmGT1 has an NH2 terminus that is 45 amino acids longer than that of either LmGT2 or LmGT3, which have NH2 termini of similar length but divergent sequence. Downstream of the predicted NH2-terminal domains, all three sequences are more than 90% identical, and all have the same predicted membrane-spanning topology. However, there are 24 additional amino acid positions that are divergent among the three isoforms. Thus, LmGT1 and LmGT2 have identical COOH termini, whereas LmGT3 differs in 8 of the last 9 amino acids, and LmGT1 has a divergent cluster of 7 amino acids toward the cytoplasmic end of the predicted transmembrane domain IV. In addition, there are nine other non-identical amino acids distributed throughout the primary amino acid sequence. Among the three isoforms, LmGT2 is the most closely related to L. enriettii Pro-1 (LmGT1, LmGT2, and LmGT3 have 78.0, 85.2, and 83.1% identity, respectively, toL. enriettii Pro-1 isoform 2). To define the 5′ end of the mRNA from LmGT1, LmGT2, and LmGT3, we amplified, subcloned, and sequenced cDNAs representing the 5′ ends of each mRNA (6Langford C.K. Ewbank S.A. Hanson S.A. Ullman B. Landfear S.M. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 1992; 55: 51-64Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). cDNA synthesized using a random oligonucleotide primer was amplified in the PCR using a reverse primer complementary to the unique NH2-terminal coding region of each mRNA and a forward primer representing the 39-nucleotide spliced leader (22Wilson K. Hanson S. Landfear S. Ullman B. Nucleic Acids Res. 1991; 19: 5787Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar) present on all L. donovani mRNAs (see “Experimental Procedures”). The sequences of the cDNA subclones revealed that the spliced leaders weretrans-spliced onto the 5′ ends of the LmGT2 and LmGT3 mRNAs at identical positions, 170 base pairs upstream of the first ATG codon. Comparison of the 5′-UTRs of theLmGT2 and LmGT3 mRNAs revealed that they were identical. In contrast, the 5′-UTR of LmGT1 showed no sequence homology with that of LmGT2 and LmGT3, and the site of spliced leader addition was 386 base pairs upstream of the first ATG codon. For each predicted transporter protein, the indicated initiation codon is the first in frame methionine codon in the RNA. The limited sequence we have obtained for the 3′-UTRs of each mRNA indicates that all three are divergent. To confirm that theLmGT genes encode bona fide glucose transporters, we expressed the LmGT2 gene in Xenopus oocytes and assayed for uptake of the glucose analog 2-deoxy-d-[3H]glucose (24Langford C.K. Little B.M. Kavanaugh M.P. Landfear S.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 17939-17943Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Oocytes injected with LmGT2 RNA exhibited robust linear uptake of the radiolabeled analog for at least 3 h, whereas oocytes injected with water did not take up this compound (Fig. 3). Biological criteria suggest that axenically cultured amastigotes of L. mexicana present a reasonable model for in vivo amastigotes (12Rainey P.M. Spithill T.W. McMahon-Pratt D. Pan A.A. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 1991; 49: 111-118Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar, 13Bates P.A. Robertson C.D. Tetley L. Coombs G.H. Parasitology. 1992; 105: 193-202Crossref PubMed Scopus (180) Google Scholar). However, if these axenic amastigotes are to be used as a model for investigating the regulation of LmGT gene expression, it is essential to establish that LmGT gene expression is correctly regulated in these cells. Consequently, we have used Northern blots to compare the expression of RNAs from several genes in promastigotes, axenically cultured amastigotes, and amastigotes derived from cultures of macrophage-like cells (Fig. 4). In these experiments, equal amounts of total RNA from promastigotes, macrophage-derived amastigotes, and axenic amastigotes were separated by gel electrophoresis. Following blotting and hybridization, the signals for each mRNA were quantitated by phosphorimaging and normalized to those for rRNA (28Comeau A.M. Miller S.I. Wirth D.F. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 1986; 21: 161-169Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar), allowing quantitative comparison of mRNA levels in each cell type. For all of the genes investigated, expression by axenically cultured amastigotes was very similar to expression by intracellular amastigotes, supporting the validity of these axenic amastigotes as a model for intracellular amastigotes. Northern blots reveal that LmGT1, LmGT2, and LmGT3 are encoded by three different mRNAs of ∼8.0, ∼3.5, and ∼7.5 kb, respectively (Fig. 4). Hybridization with probes from the 3′-UTR of each gene detect an ∼8.0-kb transcript for LmGT1 (Fig. 4 B), a ∼3.5-kb transcript for LmGT2 (Fig. 4 C), and a ∼7.5-kb transcript for LmGT3 (Fig. 4 D). Hybridization with the LmGT2 protein-coding region alone detects each of these (Fig. 4 A) and an additional ∼6.0-kb tra"

The galectins, or S-type lectins, are a large family of animal lectins distinguished from other lectins by their calcium-independent binding of β-galactoside sugars (1Drickamer K. Taylor M.E. Annu.

In evolutionary terms, they are ancient and are found distributed throughout from the lower invertebrates to higher vertebrates (5Hirabayashi J. Satoh M. Kasai K. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 15485-15490Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). They were first identified biochemically through their lectin activity (6de Waard A. Hickman S. Kornfeld S. J. Biol.

Ripoche M.A. Scaerou F. Foulis D. Poirier F. Biochem. Soc. Trans. 1996; 24: 141-146Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). The galectins fall into several classes. Galectins 1–3, 5, and 7 carry a single carbohydrate binding domain (CBD),1 whereas galectins 4, 6, and 8 carry two CBDs in tandem (4Colnot C. Ripoche M.A. Scaerou F. Foulis D. Poirier F. Biochem. Soc. Trans. 1996; 24: 141-146Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). Furthermore, of the galectins with a single CBD, galectins 1, 2, and 7 exist as noncovalent homodimers under physiological conditions (8Gitt M.A. Massa S.M. Leffler H. Barondes S.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 10601-10606Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 9Magnaldo T. Bernerd F. Darmon M. Dev. Biol. 1995; 168: 259-271Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar), whereas galectin 5 exists as a monomer (10Gitt M.A. Wiser M.F. Leffler H. Herrmann J. Xia Y.R. Massa S.M. Cooper D. Lusis A. Barondes S.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 5032-5038Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar). Galectin-3 (also known as Mac-2 (11Hughes R.C. Glycobiology. 1994; 4: 5-12Crossref PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar)) exhibits disulfide-mediated multimerization (12Woo H.J. Lotz M.M. Jung J.U. Mercurio A.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 18419-18422Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) that can increase its affinity for glycoconjugates. Crystallographic studies have shown that galectins with a single CBD have β-sandwich topology that may be related to the structure of the legume lectins such as concanavalin A (3Kasai K. Hirabayashi J. J. Biochem. 1996; 119: 1-8Crossref PubMed Scopus (454) Google Scholar). Galectins play diverse biological roles. Indeed, it appears that even a given galectin may have multiple functions. For example, both galectins 1 and 3 have been implicated in pre-mRNA splicing through the immunodepletion of in vitro splicing extracts (13Dagher S.F. Wang J.L. Patterson R.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 1213-1217Crossref PubMed Scopus (355) Google Scholar, 14Vyakarnam A. Dagher S.F. Wang J.L. Patterson R.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 4730-4737Crossref PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar). In contrast, but not surprising given their lectin activity, some galectins appear to be involved in regulating adhesion. In particular, galectin-1 was shown in vitro to promote binding between olfactory neurons and a laminin glycoconjugate that lines the axonal migration path in vivo (15Mahanthappa N.K. Cooper D.N. Barondes S.H. Schwarting G.A. Development. 1994; 120: 1373-1384PubMed Google Scholar). More recently, it has been shown that mice missing the galectin-1 gene have disrupted axonal architecture for a subset of olfactory neurons (16Puche A.C. Poirier F. Hair M. Bartlett P.F. Key B. Dev. Biol. 1996; 179: 274-287Crossref PubMed Scopus (180) Google Scholar), thus supporting the idea that galectin-1 mediates fasciculation. Different again is the demonstration from culture experiments that galectin-1 can induce programmed cell death in T-cells in a CD45-dependent manner (17Perillo N.L. Pace K.E. Seilhamer J.J. Baum L.G. Nature. 1995; 378: 736-739Crossref PubMed Scopus (940) Google Scholar). More recently, a urate transporter identified through expression screening was shown to have a high degree of identity to the galectins (18Leal-Pinto E. Tao W. Rappaport J. Richardson M. Knorr B.A. Abramson R.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 617-625Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). It is designated galectin-9, has tandem carbohydrate binding domains with affinity for lactose (19Wada J. Kanwar Y.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 6078-6086Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (281) Google Scholar), and represents one of the few galectins for which a function is defined. In the current report, we describe the characterization of a novel protein related to the galectins, designated GRIFIN (galectin-relatedinter-fiber protein), that is restricted in its expression to the lens. In the adult, GRIFIN is located at the interface between adjacent fiber cells. Although GRIFIN is clearly a galectin family member based on amino acid sequence similarity, it differs in sequence at two locations that are absolutely conserved among the galectins and that are involved in carbohydrate binding; GRIFIN does not display β-galactoside-binding activity. Timed pregnant Sprague-Dawley rats were obtained from Taconic Farms (German Town, NY) and maintained according to institutional guidelines. Ages of rats are noted as days postconception (e.g. PC 31.5). The arbitrarily primed PCR method was adapted from previously established protocols (20Ralph D. McClelland M. Welsh J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 10710-10714Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar). RNA samples for arbitrarily primed PCR were obtained from eyes taken from Sprague-Dawley rats at 29, 33, and 50 days postconception. Eye tissue used for RNA preparations included lens, ciliary body, and the ocular vasculatures with the remaining eye tissues excluded through dissection. Total RNA was extracted using the RNAzol B kit (Biotecz) and poly(A) enriched using oligo dT cellulose (Boehringer Mannheim) according to manufacturer instructions. RNA samples were treated with 0.5 units of RQ1 DNase (Promega) in 40 mm Tris-HCl, 10 mmNaCl, and 6 mm MgCl2 in the presence of 0.5 units of RNasin (Promega) for 10 min at 37 °C. After adding EDTA to 10 mm to halt the reaction, samples were extracted with equal volumes of phenol, then chloroform, and then precipitated with 0.3 m NaOAc (pH 5.5) and ethanol. cDNA was produced from 20 ng of RNA samples using 50 units Moloney murine leukemia virus reverse transcriptase (Promega) in a 20-μl reaction mixture containing 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.3, 75 mm KCl, 10 mm dithiothreitol, 3 mmMgCl2, 200 mm dNTPs, 4 pmol of two random 10-mer primers (Operon), and 20 units of RNasin. Reactions were incubated at 37 °C for 1 h. To this, 20 μl of a PCR reaction mixture containing 10 mm Tris-HCl (pH 9.0), 50 mm KCl, 1.5 mm MgCl2, 4 pmol of each primer, 5 μCi [α-32P]dCTP, and 2.5 units of Taq polymerase was added and subjected to one low stringency round of amplification (94 °C for 5 min, 27.5 °C for 3 min followed by a 5-min temperature ramp to 72 °C holding for 3 min). Following this, 40 rounds of high stringency amplification were performed (94 °C for 1 min, 39 °C for 1 min, and 72 °C for 2 min) with a final extension incubation of 72 °C for 15 min. Products were visualized on a 5% polyacrylamide, 7 m urea 1× Tris borate-EDTA gel after denaturation (5 μl of PCR reaction in 10 ml of 80% formamide with dye heated to 65 °C for 10 min). The gels were dried according to standard protocols and exposed to film overnight. Film and gel were aligned with radioactive ink dots, and bands were cut out with a scalpel and placed in a microfuge tube containing 50 μl of TE (10 mm Tris-Cl, 1 mmEDTA). DNA was allowed to elute overnight. 5 μl was then removed and subjected to the high stringency amplification protocol previously mentioned. PCR products were then visualized on 1.2% agarose gel stained with ethidium bromide. PCR products were cloned using the pCR II T-A cloning kit (Invitrogen), and positive clones were identified using blue/white selection. Miniscreens were performed using the Qiaprep system (Qiagen). Automated sequencing was performed bidirectionally using SP6 and T7 primers. Consensus sequences were elucidated using Geneworks software (IntelliGenetics) and matched against the GenBankTM data bank using the FASTA search engine. 10 μg of poly(A)+ RNA was extracted from whole eyes of PC 33.5 Sprague-Dawley rats, and cDNA was generated and then unidirectionally sub-cloned into λ-ZAP II Express vector according to the manufacturer recommendations (Stratagene). A cDNA library of 2.1 × 106isolates resulted. Library screens and phagemid excision were also performed according to the manufacturer instructions. cDNA clones hybridizing with the GRIFIN probe were sequenced from the pBK-CMV phagemid bidirectionally using T3 and T7 primers. The GeneBankTM accession number for the rat cDNA sequence for GRIFIN is AF082160. Experience had shown that cDNAs identified by arbitrarily primed PCR always matched (at their 5′ end) the most 3′ nucleotides of the random 10-mer primer. Given this, we were able to design a 20-mer primer to complement the seventeen most 5′ nucleotides of the GRIFIN cDNA subclone and the three 3′ terminal nucleotides of the OPA-4 10-mer used in the arbitrarily primed PCR amplification (Operon Technols., Inc.). When this primer was used in conjunction with a T3 primer (complementary to a region of plasmid DNA 5′ to the cloning site), we were able to amplify the relevant 5′ sequences from GRIFIN cDNAs when library DNA was used as template. Specifically, 750 μl of the 2 × 109 phage/ml amplified eye cDNA library was digested for 1 h at 55 °C in 20 mm EDTA, 0.5% SDS with 50 μg/ml proteinase K. Phenol, phenol/chloroform, and chloroform extractions followed with DNA precipitation using 0.3 m NaOAc and ethanol. DNA was resuspended in 50 μl of TE. One μl of this DNA and 100 ng of both a T3 primer and the 5′ primer (5′-TGTAATGCCATTACCCTCAG-3′) were added to a 50-μl reaction containing 10 mm Tris-HCl (pH 9.0), 50 mm KCl, 1.5 mm MgCl2, 100 ng of each primer, and 2.5 units of Taq polymerase and cycled for 40 rounds (94 °C for 1 min, 55 °C for 1 min, and 72 °C for 2 min) followed by a 15-min extension at 72 °C. The products were visualized on a 1.5% ethidium/agarose gel, subcloned into the pCR II vector, and sequenced. Total RNA or poly(A) RNA purified as above was run out on a 1% agarose, 18% formaldehyde gel and transferred overnight onto Hybond-N (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). Randomly primed probes labeled with [α-32P]dCTP (ICN) were generated according to RAPD priming protocol (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). Results were viewed and quantitated for intensity using a PhosphorImager (Molecular Dynamics). GRIFIN genomic DNA was isolated from a 129 sv genomic library in the λFIXII vector (Stratagene). Hybridization screening of the library was performed with the cDNA to GRIFIN according to the manufacturer instructions. Subcloning and sequencing of GRIFIN genomic DNA was carried out using conventional methods. The accession number for the mouse genomic sequence for GRIFIN is AF082159. N-terminal His-tagged and unmodified recombinant GRIFIN were prepared using the pRSET plasmids essentially as recommended by the manufacturer (Invitrogen). Recombinant, untagged galectin-1 was generated from a PCR-amplified cDNA subcloned into the pRSETB plasmid with the region encoding the His tag removed. All proteins were overexpressed in Escherichia coli strain BL21(DE3). Galectin-1 was purified from a bacterial extract using lactosyl-Sepharose (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). Recombinant His-tagged GRIFIN was purified using a nickel resin column. Untagged GRIFIN was overexpressed in the E. coli strain BL21(DE3) using the vector pRSETB. Cells were lysed in 150 mm NaCl, 50 mm Tris-HCl pH 8.5 (± 10 mm β-mercaptoethanol) by French Press. The cell lysate was centrifuged for 1 h at 4 °C at 15,000 rpm. Polyethyleneimine was added to the supernatant to a final concentration of 0.5% and the solution was stirred at 4 °C for 30 min. The suspension was then centrifuged at 15,000 rpm for 30 min and the supernatant loaded on a Q-Sepharose (Pharmacia) column that was pre-equilibrated with 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.5). The column was washed with 300 mm NaCl, 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.5), and the protein was step eluted with 400 mm NaCl, 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.5) (± 10 mmβ-mercaptoethanol). The protein obtained from anion exchange chromatography was concentrated and loaded on a Superdex-75 (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) gel-filtration column, using 20 mm Tris (pH 7.5), 150 mm NaCl as the elution buffer at 1 ml/min. The peak at 68–72 min corresponded to GRIFIN (or its mutant forms). SDS-PAGE conducted on the protein containing fractions from gel filtration chromatography resulted in a single band of appropriate molecular weight when visualized by silver staining. Electrospray ionization mass spectrometry was used to confirm precise subunit molecular masses. Using either of these two techniques, recombinant material was purified to homogeneity at a yield of 6–7 mg/liter of bacterial culture. Rabbit anti-GRIFIN polyclonal antisera were prepared against either the His-tagged or unmodified forms of GRIFIN using standard immunization protocols (21Harlow E. Lane D. Antibodies: A Laboratory Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1988Google Scholar). Immunization and harvesting procedures were performed by Covance (Denver, PA). Detection of recombinant GRIFIN by Western blotting was used as a means of testing antisera titers. Immunoblotting was performed according to standard procedures (21Harlow E. Lane D. Antibodies: A Laboratory Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1988Google Scholar) using Renaissance chemiluminescence visualization reagents (NEN Life Science Products). Protein A-horseradish peroxidase (Kirkegaard and Perry Laboratories Inc.) was used at a 1:5000 dilution and the polyclonal antisera to GRIFIN at a 1:2500–1:5000 dilution. Tissues for histological analysis included developmentally staged embryos or whole eyes from postnatal animals. Tissue samples were processed using conventional methods (22Culling C.F.A. Allison R.T. Barr W.T. Cellular Pathology Technique. Butterworth & Co. Ltd, London1985Google Scholar). The figures in this paper were prepared digitally using a ProGres 3012 digital camera, a Nikon slide scanner, and Adobe® Photoshop® and Quark Express® production software. Axial sections (4 μm) of paraffin-embedded, phosphate-buffered saline-formalin (4%) fixed eyes were immunofluorescently labeled according to conventional methods (20Ralph D. McClelland M. Welsh J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 10710-10714Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar). Polyclonal rabbit antiserum to GRIFIN was used at a range of dilutions between 1:50 and 1:250. The secondary antibody used was a goat anti-rabbit IgG conjugated with rhodamine (Boehringer Mannheim). The cDNA encoding GRIFIN was identified using an arbitrarily primed PCR assay (20Ralph D. McClelland M. Welsh J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 10710-10714Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar) designed to detect mRNAs differentially expressed during the postnatal stages of lens development. A PCR-amplified cDNA for GRIFIN arose in two separate reactions and appeared as an abundant product expressed at higher levels at PC day 50 than at PC 33.5 or PC 29.5 (Fig. 1, A and B). Both PCR products were bracketed with sequences complementary to the primers used. Subcloning and partial sequencing of the amplified cDNA revealed that the conceptual translation of one open reading frame showed a high degree of sequence identity to members of the galectin class of lectins. A rat eye cDNA library in λZAP II Express (Stratagene) was screened by hybridization for GRIFIN representatives using the amplified cDNA subclone fragment as a probe. GRIFIN hybridizing λ-plaques represented 1 in 5–10,000 clones. Six were plaque purified, and the pBK-CMV phagemid was excised from ZAP II Express cDNA vector and the inserts sequenced. Conceptual translation (Fig. 1 C) of the GRIFIN cDNA revealed a single open reading frame matching the amino acid sequence predicted from the amplified cDNA from arbitrarily primed PCR. The library screen failed to provide enough 5′ sequence to include the candidate start codon present in the original PCR fragment, so further PCR of phage DNA was undertaken (see “Experimental Procedures”). This strategy yielded another 23 nucleotides, and the initiator methionine codon was tentatively assigned to position 33 in the cDNA based on a reasonable match with the Kozak consensus sequence (23Kozak M. J. Cell Biol. 1989; 108: 229-241Crossref PubMed Scopus (2802) Google Scholar). A search of the nonredundant protein data base (at NCBI;http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/) using the BLAST algorithm revealed that the GRIFIN open reading frame encoded a protein of the galectin class. The GRIFIN amino acid sequence was aligned with many of the known galectin family members (Fig. 1 D) using the alignment program Clustawl (http://www.public.iastate.edu/∼pedro/rt_1.html) and was shown to be highly related. The alignment program was directed to choose the alignment order based on relatedness. Thus, being positioned last in the alignment series, GRIFIN is the most distant family member. Of the eight Gal-2 residues identified as forming direct contacts with carbohydrate (24Hirabayashi J. Kasai K. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 23648-23653Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and the three residues whose mutation abolished lactose binding in Gal-1 (25Solis D. Jumenez-Barbero J. Matin-Lomas M. Diaz-Maurino T. Eur. J. Biochem. 1994; 234: 107-114Crossref Scopus (33) Google Scholar), GRIFIN has two that diverge from the consensus galectin sequence: Lys-48 instead of Asn and Val-72 instead of Arg/Lys(Fig. 1 D, asterisks). GRIFIN did not show any characteristics of a secretory leader sequence (26von Heijne G. J. Membr. Biol. 1990; 115: 195-201Crossref PubMed Scopus (857) Google Scholar) nor of a GPI-linked protein (27Udenfriend S. Kodukula K. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1995; 64: 563-591Crossref PubMed Scopus (434) Google Scholar). A hydrophobicity plot (generated by the IntelliGenetics Geneworks software) did not provide any indication of the presence of a transmembrane domain. To assess the expression pattern of GRIFIN, mRNA was isolated from a variety of rat tissues and subject to Northern blotting analysis. Stringent wash conditions were employed in an experiment using the rat GRIFIN cDNA as a hybridization probe. GRIFIN mRNA was detected at high levels in the eye but not elsewhere (Fig. 2 A). The band representing GRIFIN was clearly not a single species when compared with the internal control (the mRNA representing glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH)). A further Northern hybridization to RNA prepared from dissected lenses as well as the remaining eye tissues revealed that GRIFIN expression was restricted to the lens (data not shown). Because GRIFIN had been identified based on differential representation after PCR amplification, we determined whether its mRNA was modulated through development. Northern blotting of total RNA under stringent washing conditions revealed three GRIFIN mRNA species closely related in size but with different patterns of modulation (Fig. 2 B). The largest of the species (species a) was expressed at high levels at PC days 18 and 20 but showed diminished intensity from PC 22 onward. Species b increased in intensity only at PC 46 and PC 50 (Fig. 2 B, tracks labeled46 and 50). Species c is represented at higher levels from PC 22–30, reaching a peak at PC 34. Hybridization of the same Northern filter to a probe for GAPDH provided a control for RNA loading (Fig. 2 C). We isolated and characterized λ-clones encompassing the GRIFIN gene from a 129 sv strain DNA library in λFIXII (Stratagene). Three hybridizing λ-clones were plaque purified, and the inserts were subcloned into pGEM7z and restriction mapped. The exonic region of the gene was identified through Southern hybridization with a rat GRIFIN cDNA probe, and a restriction fragment carrying the gene was subcloned and sequenced. Comparison of the sequences of the cDNAs and the genomic DNA revealed that the GRIFIN gene was made up of five exons and was a little less than 2 kilobases from the 5′- to 3′-untranslated regions (Fig. 3 A). A TATA box sequence is present upstream of exon 1, and a canonical polyadenylation sequence corresponding to that identified in the rat cDNA was located at the 3′ end of the gene (Fig. 3 C). Three sets of imperfect direct repeats were detected in the region of the gene using a dot matrix comparison method (http://alces.med.umn.edu/rawdot.html). Two of these repeats were located in the region upstream of the promoter and consisted of two 58-bp repeats (Fig. 3 B, long arrows) and three 10-bp repeats (Fig. 3 B, small arrows). Two of the 10-bp repeats appear at the 5′ end of the 58-bp repeats. Within the 58-bp repeats, sequences that match the consensus binding sites for the transcription factors c-myb (28Thompson M.A. Ramsay R.G. Bioessays. 1995; 17: 341-350Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar) and δEF1 (29Funahashi J. Sekido R. Murai K. Kamachi Y. Kondoh H. Development. 1993; 119: 433-446Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 30Kamachi Y. Kondoh H. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 5206-5215Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) are found (Fig. 3 B, gray bars). Two additional potential binding sites for each of these transcription factors are located between the direct repeats and the TATA box. The second set of imperfect direct repeats appear in the exon 4-intron 4 region (Fig. 3 C). These repeats are each 65 bp in length and contain two consensus binding sites for the transcription factor δEF1. The first repeat overlaps the splice donor for exon 4, and this places one potential δEF1 binding site within the coding region of exon 4 (Fig. 3 C). An examination of GRIFIN protein by immunoblotting revealed that, during the developmental period corresponding to fiber cell differentiation, the level of GRIFIN increased markedly (Fig. 4 A). According to an estimation based on the use of recombinant GRIFIN as a control, endogenous GRIFIN represents about 0.5% of total lens protein in the adult (data not shown). Despite the appearance of multiple mRNA species (Fig. 3, A and B), only a single GRIFIN protein species is observed on a native gel (Fig. 4 A). Furthermore, this single species runs at approximately 28 kDa, suggesting that it might be a dimer of the 15 kDa monomer. Given this observation, we sought additional evidence for the dimerization of GRIFIN. On SDS-PAGE gels, both recombinant and endogenous GRIFIN were observed at the expected monomeric size of about 15 kDa (Fig. 4 B). In contrast, recombinant untagged GRIFIN eluted from a size-exclusion column between the 25- and 43-kDa size standards (Fig. 4 C) suggesting that by this measure too, GRIFIN might exist in dimeric form. To test directly whether GRIFIN would dimerize, we determined whether His-tagged recombinant GRIFIN could form a heterodimer with either the untagged recombinant form or endogenous material in a lens extract (Fig. 4 D). When His-tagged GRIFIN was combined with either untagged GRIFIN (Fig. 4 D, track 4) or lens extract containing endogenous GRIFIN (Fig. 4 D, track 5), three distinct species were observed on a native gel. Included as controls were His-tagged recombinant GRIFIN (Fig. 4 D, track 1), untagged recombinant GRIFIN (Fig. 4 D, track 2), and endogenous GRIFIN in lens extract (Fig. 4 D, track 3). In order of reducing molecular weight, the species apparent in tracks 4 and 5 correspond to the His-tagged GRIFIN homodimer, a heterodimer between untagged and his-tagged GRIFIN, and a homodimer of untagged protein. No monomeric GRIFIN was observed. Combined, these experiments provide strong evidence that GRIFIN can form a stable dimer and that it probably exists as a dimer in the lens. Anticipating that GRIFIN would display the lactose-binding characteristics of the galectin family members, we tested its ability to bind lactosyl-Sepharose (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). In initial experiments, GRIFIN did not display any lactose-binding activity. GRIFIN differs in sequence from the galectin family of proteins at three key positions involved in sugar-binding. To test the possibility that lack of sequence conservation at these locations was responsible for the inability of GRIFIN to bind lactose, we modified residues at positions 47, 48, and 71 (Fig. 1 D, residues indicated in red) so that the GRIFIN sequence conformed closely to the conserved CBD consensus. The resulting altered protein was referred to as the GRIFIN triple mutant (TM) and included the changes Val-47 to Phe, Lys-48 to Asn and Val-71 to Arg. Recombinant GRIFIN-TM was overexpressed in E. coli and chromatographically purified as described previously for wild-type GRIFIN. The pure protein was tested for its ability to bind lactosyl-Sepharose beads under conditions that effectively immobilized recombinant Gal-1. GRIFIN and GRIFIN-TM did not bind lactosyl-Sepharose (Fig. 4 E). In contrast, in parallel experiments approximately 90% of recombinant galectin-1 bound to lactosyl-Sepharose and was eluted with lactose (Fig. 4 E). Recombinant GRIFIN proteins with either one or two of the changes in the triple mutant also displayed no discernible lactose-binding activity (data not shown). To allow a detailed examination of the location of GRIFIN in the lens, we generated rabbit polyclonal antiserum using recombinant material and performed immunofluorescence labeling of histological sections from the eye (Fig. 5). Immunoreactivity for anti-GRIFIN antiserum was detected in the fiber cells of the lens at the day of birth (PC 22) (Fig. 3 A). Immunoreactivity was highest in the central region of the lens, whereas the lens epithelium and the anterior tip of the fiber cells immediately underlying the epithelial layer have minimal immunoreactivity (Fig. 5, A and B). Lens sections incubated with nonimmune rabbit serum in the place of anti-GRIFIN antiserum showed minimal background fluorescence (Fig. 5 C). Interestingly, adult lens sections show a distinctly different pattern of GRIFIN immunoreactivity (Fig. 5, D-G). At low magnification, discrete areas of immunoreactivity are observed in a peripheral region underlying the lens epithelium (Fig. 5 D) and were not observed in control sections incubated with preimmune serum (Fig. 5 E). This provides evidence that there may be a relocalization of the GRIFIN protein dependent on developmental stage. In the adult lens, GRIFIN immunoreactivity is observed at the angular interface between fiber cells over an extended region of the fiber cell stacks; labeling is present but much less intense at the flat interface between adjacent fiber cells (Fig. 5, F and G). The changing pattern of GRIFIN labeling seen in Fig. 5 D is probably a reflection of the changing direction of the fiber cell axes at a lens suture (white arrowhead). We have identified a lens-specific protein that is related to the family of small, soluble lectins called galectins (1Drickamer K. Taylor M.E. Annu. Rev. Cell Biol. 1993; 9: 237-264Crossref PubMed Scopus (705) Google Scholar, 2Barondes S.H. Cooper D.N.W. Gitt M.A. Leffler H. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 20807-20810Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 3Kasai K. Hirabayashi J. J. Biochem. 1996; 119: 1-8Crossref PubMed Scopus (454) Google Scholar, 4Colnot C. Ripoche M.A. Scaerou F. Foulis D. Poirier F. Biochem. Soc. Trans. 1996; 24: 141-146Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). The protein, designated GRIFIN (galectin-relatedinter-fiber protein) appears to be expressed exclusively in the lens and is restricted to the differentiated fiber cells of this organ. GRIFIN forms a stable dimerin vitro and, by immunofluorescence, is located at the interface between adjacent lens fiber cells. The location of expression, cellular distribution, and biochemical characteristics of GRIFIN raise a number of interesting questions concerning its likely function. We currently have no satisfactory explanation for the appearance of three GRIFIN mRNA species. The structure of the genomic locus did not reveal potential splicing signals besides those that would give the intron-exon structure indicated. Furthermore, the many GRIFIN cDNAs shown provided no unequivocal evidence of multiple splice variants. The existence of a single protein product probably means that the existence of three mRNA species is of limited biological significance. The GRIFIN gene has a set of large direct repeats that encompass the 3′ splice site of exon 4. Within each repeat are two potential binding sites for the transcription factor δEF1. This is a zinc finger and homeodomain transcription factor that has previously been implicated in conferring lens-specific expression of the chicken δ1-crystallin gene (29Funahashi J. Sekido R. Murai K. Kamachi Y. Kondoh H. Development. 1993; 119: 433-446Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The enhancer at which δEF1 acts is located toward the 3′ end of the δ1-crystallin gene in the third intron (30Kamachi Y. Kondoh H. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 5206-5215Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The similar location of the potential δEF1 binding sites in the GRIFIN gene and its lens-specific expression may indicate some similarities in the mechanism of transcriptional regulation. GRIFIN does not bind β-galactoside sugars under conditions where both galectin-1 and galectin-3 will. All current members of the galectin family show β-galactoside binding activity even though many have been identified using techniques that did not rely on lectin activity (2Barondes S.H. Cooper D.N.W. Gitt M.A. Leffler H. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 20807-20810Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 3Kasai K. Hirabayashi J. J. Biochem. 1996; 119: 1-8Crossref PubMed Scopus (454) Google Scholar, 4Colnot C. Ripoche M.A. Scaerou F. Foulis D. Poirier F. Biochem. Soc. Trans. 1996; 24: 141-146Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). The lack of two residues in the CBD that are conserved in other family members (Lys-48 and Val-71) might have explained the lack of lectin activity except for the fact that a mutant form of GRIFIN, conforming to the conserved motifs, did not show β-galactoside binding activity either. While sequence homology suggests that the polypeptide fold of GRIFIN is likely to be similar to that of the galectins, the lack of demonstrable lectin activity indicates stereochemical differences in the putative carbohydrate binding pocket. It is also possible that GRIFIN will bind particular sugars under conditions not tested here. GRIFIN forms very stable dimers in vitro according to multiple criteria. Striking is the observation that no monomeric form is apparent under native conditions. Many of the galectins will form dimers or multimers (3Kasai K. Hirabayashi J. J. Biochem. 1996; 119: 1-8Crossref PubMed Scopus (454) Google Scholar) or have two tandemly repeated CBDs (3Kasai K. Hirabayashi J. J. Biochem. 1996; 119: 1-8Crossref PubMed Scopus (454) Google Scholar, 4Colnot C. Ripoche M.A. Scaerou F. Foulis D. Poirier F. Biochem. Soc. Trans. 1996; 24: 141-146Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar), and this argues that their biological function requires the cross-linking of glycoconjugates. In the absence of a lectin activity for GRIFIN, it is not clear whether the same significance can be attached to its dimerization. One interesting possibility for the function of GRIFIN is that it may be a new lens crystallin. The class of soluble, abundant proteins collectively referred to as the crystallins are expressed exclusively or primarily in the lens (31Piatigorsky J. Cell. 1984; 38: 620-621Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). They have evolved from proteins with high solubility and provide the high protein concentration necessary for light refraction. With the characterization of multiple crystallins, it has become clear that any protein with high solubility can evolve for function as a crystallin (32Wistow G.J. Piatigorsky J. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1988; 57: 479-504Crossref PubMed Scopus (675) Google Scholar). Crystallin proteins include an α-enolase (33Wistow G.J. Lietman T. Williams L.A. Stapel S.O. de Jong W.W. Horwitz J. Piatigorsky J. J. Cell Biol. 1988; 107: 2729-2736Crossref PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar), an arginosuccinate lyase (34Wistow G.J. Piatigorsky J. Gene (Amst.). 1990; 96: 263-270Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar), and lactate dehydrogenase (35Wistow G.J. Mulders J.W. de Jong W.W. Nature. 1987; 326: 622-624Crossref PubMed Scopus (163) Google Scholar). Like many of the crystallins, GRIFIN is expressed exclusively in the lens, and it is both abundant and highly soluble. Although we cannot exclude the possibility that GRIFIN has a function in binding a saccharide, it does not have the characteristic lactose-binding activity of the class of molecules to which it is most closely related. Combined, these characteristics might support the idea that GRIFIN represents a novel crystallin that has evolved from a galectin but has not retained its capacity to bind lactose. The location of GRIFIN at the interface between lens fiber cells tends to counter the argument that it is a crystallin because those that have been characterized show a uniform cytoplasmic distribution. Because many of the galectins are secreted from cells despite the lack of a classical signal sequence, there is a possibility that the observed distribution of GRIFIN reflects a position outside the plasma membrane. Whether intra- or extracellular, the pattern of immunofluorescence for GRIFIN suggests that its primary function is executed at the membrane. Further studies on molecules that interact with GRIFIN may prove revealing. We are grateful to Jon Weider for assistance with all aspects of imaging and to Doug Cooper for pointing out the recent addition of the human GRIFIN gene to the high-throughput genomic sequenced data base. While this paper was in review, human genomic sequence encoding the gene for GRIFIN was added to the high-throughput genomic sequence data base (accession number AC004840, nucleotide segment 11172 to 17312). Analysis of the intron-exon structure and the deduced mRNA sequence revealed an encoded protein showing a high degree of identity to rat GRIFIN. Importantly, the amino acids in rat GRIFIN within the carbohydrate-binding domain that deviate from the galectin consensus are also variant in human GRIFIN."
https://openalex.org/W2099674213,"The tumor suppressor protein p53 has been implicated in the response of cells to DNA damage. Studies to date have demonstrated a role for p53 in the transcriptional activation of target genes in the cellular response to DNA damage that results in either growth arrest or apoptosis. In contrast, here is demonstrated a role for p53 in regulating the basal level of expression of the cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor p21 in the absence of treatment with DNA-damaging agents. Wild-type p53-expressing MCF10F cells had detectable levels of p21 mRNA and protein, whereas the p53-negative Saos-2 cells did not. Saos-2 cells were infected with recombinant retrovirus to establish a proliferating pool of cells with a comparable constitutive level of expression of wild-type p53 protein to that seen in untreated MCF10F cells. Restoration of wild-type but not mutant p53 expression recovered a basal level of expression of p21 in these cells. Constitutive expression of luciferase reporter constructs containing the p21 promoter was inhibited by co-transfection with the human MDM2 protein or a dominant-negative p53 protein and was dependent on the presence of p53 response elements in the reporter constructs. Furthermore, p53 in nuclear extracts of untreated cells was capable of binding to DNA in a sequence-specific manner. These results implicate a role for p53 in regulating constitutive levels of expression of p21 and demonstrate that the p53 protein is capable of sequence-specific DNA binding and transcriptional activation in untreated, proliferating cells."

Cleavage between the threonine and the glycine of the LPXTG motif liberates the carboxyl of threonine to form an amide bond with the pentaglycyl cross-bridge in the staphylococcal peptidoglycan. Here, we asked whether altered peptidoglycan cross-bridges interfere with the sorting reaction and investigated surface protein anchoring in staphylococcalfem mutants. S. aureus strains carrying mutations in the femA, femB, femAB, or the femAX genes synthesize altered cross-bridges, and each of these strains displayed decreased sorting activity. Characterization of cell wall anchor structures purified from thefem mutants revealed that surface proteins were linked to cross-bridges containing one, three, or five glycyl residues, but not to the ε-amino of lysyl in muropeptides without glycine. When tested in a femAB strain synthesizing cross-bridges with mono-, tri-, and pentaglycyl as well as tetraglycyl-monoseryl, surface proteins were found anchored mostly to the five-residue cross-bridges (pentaglycyl or tetraglycyl-monoseryl). Thus, although wild-type peptidoglycan appears to be the preferred substrate for the sorting reaction, altered cell wall cross-bridges can be linked to the COOH-terminal end of surface proteins.

Gram-positive bacteria display proteins on their surface as a means to interact with host tissues and to establish human infections (1Foster T.J. McDevitt D. FEMS Microbiol.

The mechanism of surface protein anchoring to the bacterial cell wall has recently been established for protein A of Staphylococcus aureus. After synthesis in the cytoplasm, protein A is first initiated into the secretory pathway by an NH2-terminal signal (leader) peptide (3Schneewind O. Model P. Fischetti V.A. Cell. 1992; 70: 267-281Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (435) Google Scholar). A 35-residue COOH-terminal sorting signal is necessary and sufficient for the anchoring of protein A and functions to first retain the polypeptide within the secretory pathway (4Schneewind O. Mihaylova-Petkov D. Model P. EMBO J. 1993; 12: 4803-4811Crossref PubMed Scopus (359) Google Scholar). This allows proteolytic cleavage between the threonine and the glycine of the conserved LPXTG motif (5Navarre W.W. Schneewind O. Mol. Microbiol. 1994; 14: 115-121Crossref PubMed Scopus (306) Google Scholar). The liberated carboxyl of threonine is amide linked to the amino of the pentaglycyl cross-bridge of the staphylococcal peptidoglycan, thereby tethering the COOH-terminal end of protein A to the bacterial cell wall (6Schneewind O. Fowler A. Faull K.F. Science. 1995; 268: 103-106Crossref PubMed Scopus (375) Google Scholar, 7Ton-That H. Faull K.F. Schneewind O. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 22285-22292Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar). This amide bond exchange mechanism displays striking similarity to the penicillin-sensitive transpeptidation reaction (8Tipper D.J. Strominger J.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1965; 54: 1133-1141Crossref PubMed Scopus (630) Google Scholar), during which the cell wall pentapeptide precursor is cleaved at the peptide bond betweend-alanyl-d-alanine, while the liberated carboxyl of d-alanyl is amide linked to the free amino of the peptidoglycan cross-bridge (9Ghuysen J.-M. Annu. Rev. Microbiol. 1991; 45: 37-67Crossref PubMed Scopus (491) Google Scholar), pentaglycyl in S. aureus(10Ghuysen J.-M. Bacteriol. Rev. 1968; 32: 425-464Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Elements involved in transpeptidation and the sorting reaction are conserved in Gram-positive bacteria (6Schneewind O. Fowler A. Faull K.F. Science. 1995; 268: 103-106Crossref PubMed Scopus (375) Google Scholar, 11Schleifer K.H. Kandler O. Bacteriol. Rev. 1972; 36: 407-477Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Thus, it seems likely that cell wall sorting is a universal mechanism for the anchoring of surface proteins (6Schneewind O. Fowler A. Faull K.F. Science. 1995; 268: 103-106Crossref PubMed Scopus (375) Google Scholar). If so, sortase, the enzymatic activity that is thought to catalyze this reaction, might also be found conserved in many different bacterial species and could provide a target for an antibacterial therapy that interferes with surface protein anchoring (6Schneewind O. Fowler A. Faull K.F. Science. 1995; 268: 103-106Crossref PubMed Scopus (375) Google Scholar). Although the presence of free amino groups is a common feature in the cross-bridges of bacterial peptidoglycans, the overall chemical nature of this structure varies between different Gram-positive bacteria (11Schleifer K.H. Kandler O. Bacteriol. Rev. 1972; 36: 407-477Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In staphylococci, the cross-bridge is composed of five glycyl, whereas in some streptococci and listerial species it consists of two alanyl and meso-diaminopimelic acid, respectively (11Schleifer K.H. Kandler O. Bacteriol. Rev. 1972; 36: 407-477Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Genetic analysis of staphylococcal methicillin resistance has provided insights into the synthesis of peptidoglycan cross-bridges. Staphylococcal strains expressing the penicillin binding protein PBP2a (PBP2′) are resistant to most β-lactam antibiotics including methicillin (12Hartman B.J. Tomasz A. J.

Genetic screens designed to identify elements that are also necessary for methicillin resistance yielded mutations in approximately ten different fem (aux) genes (17Berger-Bächi B.

Bacteriol. 1997; 179: 5321-5325Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The precise biochemical defect of other fem mutations is still unknown (29Kopp U. Roos M. Wecke J. Labischinski H. Microb. Drug Resist. 1996; 2: 29-41Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). Presently available staphylococcal strains harboring mutations in thefemA, femB, and femX genes synthesize altered cell wall cross-bridges with either three glycyl (femB), one glycyl (femA), or a combination of no or one glycyl (29Kopp U. Roos M. Wecke J. Labischinski H. Microb. Drug Resist. 1996; 2: 29-41Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). The latter phenotype has been reported for a mutant with a combination of a femA mutation and a second one leading to a partial non-functional FemX protein (hereafter calledfemAX) (29Kopp U. Roos M. Wecke J. Labischinski H. Microb. Drug Resist. 1996; 2: 29-41Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). Biochemical studies on the synthesis of staphylococcal peptidoglycan revealed that the pentaglycyl cross-bridge is synthesized via modification of the lipid II precursor (undecaprenylpyrophosphate-MurNAc(-l-Ala-d-iGln-l-Lys-d-Ala-dAla)-(β1–4)-GlcNAc) (30Matsuhashi M.

Three glycyl tRNA species are dedicated to this biosynthetic pathway (33Stewart T.S. Roberts R.J. Strominger J.L. Nature. 1971; 230: 36-38Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar, 34Roberts R.J.

After being charged with amino acid, these tRNAs are thought to serve as substrate in a sequence of reactions that successively add glycine either directly to the ε-amino of lysyl or to the amino of another glycyl (31Matsuhashi M. Dietrich C.P. Strominger J.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1967; 242: 3191-3206Abstract Full Text PDF Google Scholar, 34Roberts R.J. Lovinger G.G. Tamura T. Strominger J.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1974; 249: 4781-4786Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). It seems likely that the femA, femB, and femXgenes specify enzymatic activities that catalyze these reactions (29Kopp U. Roos M. Wecke J. Labischinski H. Microb. Drug Resist. 1996; 2: 29-41Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). In this model, one enzyme, presumably FemX, adds the first glycine to the ε-amino side chain of lysyl within lipid II (29Kopp U. Roos M. Wecke J. Labischinski H. Microb. Drug Resist. 1996; 2: 29-41Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). FemA and FemB are thought to each add two additional glycines, thereby synthesizing cross-bridges with three and five glycyl, respectively (29Kopp U. Roos M. Wecke J. Labischinski H. Microb. Drug Resist. 1996; 2: 29-41Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). It is conceivable that each Fem factor might recognize one of the three glycyl tRNA species (35Roberts R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1974; 249: 4787-4796Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 36Green C.I. Vold B.S. J. Bacteriol. 1993; 175: 5091-5096Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). If so, one would predict that mutations in any one of the three glycyl tRNA genes should cause the same phenotype as the corresponding fem mutants. Here, we asked whether the sorting reaction of surface proteins can proceed in fem mutant staphylococci. As compared with wild-type cells, the half-life of surface protein precursor molecules was increased in fem mutant strains, suggesting that the sorting reaction is partially hindered. Characterization of anchor structures revealed that surface proteins were linked to peptidoglycan with cross-bridges harboring mono-, tri-, or pentaglycyl as well as tetraglycyl-monoseryl. No surface protein was found attached to the ε-amino of lysyl, suggesting that the sorting reaction discriminates between certain peptidoglycan cross-bridges. Plasmids pHTT4 (7Ton-That H. Faull K.F.

Drug Resist. 1996; 2: 29-41Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). Briefly, strains were grown in CY broth containing glycerol phosphate overnight (per liter CY: 10 g of casamino acids, 10 g of yeast extract, 5 g of glucose, 5.9 g of NaCl; 40 ml of sterile filtered 1.5 mβ-glycerophosphate were added after autoclaving) (37Novick R.P. Methods Enzymol. 1991; 204: 587-636Crossref PubMed Scopus (467) Google Scholar). Staphylococci (109 colony-forming units) were sedimented by centrifugation at 7000 × g for 3 min and suspended in 200 μl of phage buffer (1 mm MgSO4, 4 mm CaCl2, 50 mm Tris-HCl, 100 mm NaCl, pH 7.8, and 1 g of gelatin added per liter). Phage lysate, 200 μl generated from S. aureus OS2 carrying either pHTT4 or pSeb-Cws-BlaZ, was added for 10 min, and cells were plated on tryptic soy agar containing 10 μg/ml chloramphenicol.Escherichia coli BL21(DE3) pLysS, pHTT2 was used to purify staphylococcal φ11 hydrolase as described previously (7Ton-That H. Faull K.F. Schneewind O. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 22285-22292Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar). Staphylococcal strains harboring pSeb-Cws-BlaZ were grown overnight in tryptic soy broth supplemented with chloramphenicol (10 μg/ml), diluted 1:20 into fresh medium, and grown with shaking at 37 °C until A 600 0.6. Cells from 1 ml of culture were sedimented by centrifugation at 8000 × gfor 2 min and washed with 1 ml of prewarmed minimal medium (3Schneewind O. Model P. Fischetti V.A. Cell. 1992; 70: 267-281Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (435) Google Scholar). The cells were suspended in 1 ml of minimal medium, and newly synthesized polypeptide was labeled with 100 μCi of [35S]Promix (Amersham) for 1 min. Labeling was quenched by the addition of an excess non-radioactive amino acid (50-μl chase (100 mg/ml casamino acids, 20 mg/ml methionine)). At timed intervals after the addition of the chase, 0, 2, 5, and 10 min, 250-μl aliquots were removed, and protein was precipitated by the addition of 250 μl of 10% trichloroacetic acid. The precipitate was sedimented by centrifugation 15,000 × g for 10 min, washed with 1 ml of acetone, and dried. Samples were suspended in 1 ml of 0.5 mTris-HCl, pH 6.8, and staphylococcal peptidoglycan was digested by adding 50 μl of mutanolysin (5000 units/ml, Sigma) and incubating 4 h at 37 °C. Proteins were again precipitated with trichloroacetic acid, washed with acetone, and subjected to immunoprecipitation with α-BlaZ (38Navarre W.W. Schneewind O. J. Bacteriol. 1996; 178: 441-446Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) followed by SDS-PAGE and PhosphorImager analysis. Staphylococcal strains harboring pHTT4 were grown overnight in tryptic soy broth supplemented with 10 μg/ml chloramphenicol, diluted 1:40 into 4 liters of fresh medium, and grown with 250 rpm shaking for 5 h at 37 °C. Cells were sedimented by centrifugation at 8000 × g for 15 min. Pellets were suspended in 100 ml of water, extracted with 100 ml of ethanol-acetone (1:1), and incubated for 30 min on ice. The cells were collected by centrifugation, washed with 300 ml of ice-cold water, and suspended in 30 ml of 0.1 m Tris-HCl, pH 7.5. The peptidoglycan was digested by adding 210 μg of purified φ11 hydrolase for 16 h at 37 °C. Seb-MH6-Cws was purified as described previously (7Ton-That H. Faull K.F. Schneewind O. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 22285-22292Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar). Briefly, the digested cell wall was centrifuged at 17,000 × g for 15 min to remove insoluble material, and the supernatant was subjected to affinity chromatography. 2 ml of Ni-NTA Sepharose (Qiagen) were washed with equilibration buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, 150 mmNaCl, pH 7.5), loaded with the supernatant of the φ11 hydrolase digest, washed first with 30 ml of wash buffer (50 mmTris-HCl, 150 mm NaCl, 10% glycerol, pH 7.5) and then with 30 ml of equilibration buffer. Bound protein was eluted with 0.5m imidazole in wash buffer. Seb-MH6-Cws was precipitated with 7% trifluoroacetic acid (v/v), washed with acetone, dried under vacuum, and dissolved in 600 μl of 70% formic acid. A crystal of CnBr was added, and the cleavage reaction was incubated for 16 h at room temperature. The reaction mixture was dried under vacuum, washed with water, and dissolved in 1 ml of buffer A (6m guanidine hydrochloride, 0.1 mNaH2PO4, 0.01 m Tris-HCl, pH 8.0). The sample was subjected to 1 ml Ni-NTA Sepharose column pre-equilibrated with buffer A, washed with 10 ml of buffer A, 10 ml of buffer B (6 m urea, 0.1 mNaH2PO4, 0.01 m Tris-HCl, pH 8.0), and 10 ml of buffer C (same as buffer B, but pH 6.3). Anchor peptides were eluted with 2 ml of 0.5 m acetic acid, desalted over C18 cartridge (Analtech), and subjected to MALDI-MS. MALDI-MS spectra were obtained on a reflectron time-of-flight instrument (PerSeptive Biosystems Voyager RP) in the linear mode. Samples (0.5–1.0 μl) were co-spotted with 1.0 μl of matrix (α-cyano-4-hydroxycinnamic acid at 1 mg/100 μl CH3CN:water:trifluoroacetic acid (70:30:0.1)) and mass measured using an external calibration with bovine insulin (7Ton-That H. Faull K.F. Schneewind O. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 22285-22292Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar). Previous work characterized the processing of Seb-Cws-BlaZ, harboring a central sorting signal flanked by NH2-terminal Seb and COOH-terminal BlaZ domains (5Navarre W.W. Schneewind O. Mol. Microbiol. 1994; 14: 115-121Crossref PubMed Scopus (306) Google Scholar). Seb-Cws-BlaZ is exported from the cytoplasm by an NH2-terminal signal peptide and cleaved between the threonine and the glycine of its LPXTG motif (5Navarre W.W. Schneewind O. Mol. Microbiol. 1994; 14: 115-121Crossref PubMed Scopus (306) Google Scholar). The NH2-terminal Seb fragment is linked to the staphylococcal peptidoglycan, whereas the COOH-terminal BlaZ domain remains in the bacterial cytosol (5Navarre W.W. Schneewind O. Mol. Microbiol. 1994; 14: 115-121Crossref PubMed Scopus (306) Google Scholar). All surface protein that is cleaved at the LPXTG motif is also anchored to the cell wall (5Navarre W.W. Schneewind O. Mol. Microbiol. 1994; 14: 115-121Crossref PubMed Scopus (306) Google Scholar). Hence, the rate of cleavage at the LPXTG motif of pulse-labeled Seb-Cws-BlaZ is a measure for the rate of surface protein anchoring in various staphylococcal fem mutant strains. Staphylococci were pulse labeled with [35S]methionine for 1 min. At timed intervals during chase, culture aliquots were precipitated with trichloroacetic acid and washed in acetone. The staphylococcal peptidoglycan was digested with mutanolysin, and all protein was again precipitated with trichloroacetic acid prior to immunoprecipitation with α-BlaZ and SDS-PAGE. The amount of Seb-Cws-BlaZ precursor and BlaZ cleavage fragment were determined by PhosphorImager analysis. Fig. 1 B shows the autoradiogram of a typical experiment that measured the processing of Seb-Cws-BlaZ in S. aureus BB308 (femAB). In wild-type cells the half-life of the precursor was 0.53 min for S. aureus OS2 (spa −, ermr) and 1.4 min for BB270 (Mc r). All S. aureus femstrains displayed an increased half-life of the Seb-Cws-BlaZ precursor: 2.12 min (UK17 (femA of BB270)), 2.58 min (UT34–2 (femB:Tn551 of BB270)), 2.38 min (BB308 (femA:Tn551 of BB270)), and 2.25 min (UK31 (femAXof BB270)). Together, these results suggested that the sorting reaction of surface proteins is significantly slowed in the femmutant staphylococci. To characterize the anchor structure of surface proteins in fem mutant staphylococci, we employed another hybrid protein. Seb-MH6-Cws is composed of enterotoxin B carrying an NH2-terminal signal peptide and a COOH-terminally fused sorting signal of protein A. At the fusion joint between Seb and the sorting signal, a methionine followed by six histidines is inserted. When expressed in staphylococci, this protein is exported and linked to the bacterial cell wall. φ11 hydrolase cleaves the staphylococcal peptidoglycan at the peptide bonds betweenN-acetylmuramyl-l-alanyl (amidase) andd-alanyl-glycyl. 2W. W. Navarre, H. Ton-That, K. F. Faull, and O. Schneewind, manuscript in preparation.After peptidoglycan solubilization with the φ11 hydrolase, Seb-MH6-Cws was affinity purified on nickel Sepharose, cleaved at methionyl with CnBr, and COOH-terminal anchor peptides were purified by another round of chromatography on Ni-NTA Sepharose. Fig. 2 shows that purified Seb-MH6-Cws migrated as two distinct species on SDS-PAGE. The faster migrating species hasl-Ala-d-iGln-l-Lys(Gly5)d-Ala amide linked to the carboxyl of its COOH-terminal threonine, whereas the slower migrating species carries MurNAc[l-Ala-d-iGln-l-Lys(Gly5)-d-Ala]-(β1–4)-GlcNAc (7Ton-That H. Faull K.F. Schneewind O. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 22285-22292Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar). The migration pattern of Seb-MH6-Cws purified from strains OS2 (wild type), UK17 (femA), UT34–2 (femB), BB308 (femAB), and UK31 (femAX) was indistinguishable on SDS-PAGE. Anchor peptides purified from the peptidoglycan of the femB mutant strain UT34–2 were desalted and analyzed by MALDI-MS. The mass spectrum in Fig. 3revealed signals at m/z 2123, 2193, 2601, 2642, 2670, 4224, and 4742. The measurement of m/z 2123 was consistent with the structure of a COOH-terminal peptide linked tol-Ala-d-iGln-l-Lys(Gly3)-d-Ala, whereas the signal at m/z 2193 was consistent with an anchor peptide and linkedl-Ala-d-iGln-l-Lys(Gly3)-d-Ala-d-Ala. Compounds with m/z 2601 and 2670 represented anchor peptides with linked MurNAc-[l-Ala-d-iGln-l-Lys(Gly3)-d-Ala]-(β1–4)-GlcNAc and MurNAc-[l-Ala-d-iGln-l-Lys(Gly3)-d-Ala-d-Ala]-(β1–4)-GlcNAc, respectively. The ion with m/z 2642 was explained as anchor peptide linked to O-6-acetyl-MurNAc-[l-Ala-d-iGln-l-Lys(Gly3)-d-Ala]-(β1–4)-GlcNAc in which the muramic acid is N,O-6-diacetylated, a modification present in approximately half of all staphylococcal muramoyl residues (39Ghuysen J.-M. Strominger J.L. Biochemistry. 1963; 2: 1119-1125Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). Compounds with m/z 4224 and 4742 represented anchor peptides in which the methionine at position 251 had not been cleaved, resulting in additional upstream peptide sequence (NH2-VDSKDVKIEVYLTTKKGTMHHHHHHAQALPET-anchor structure) (7Ton-That H. Faull K.F. Schneewind O. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 22285-22292Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar). Taken together, the results indicated that all detectable anchor peptides were linked to the peptidoglycan of thefemB mutant S. aureus strain UT34–2 via triglycyl cross-bridges. After digestion of the cell wall of S. aureus UK17 (pHTT4) with φ11 hydrolase, anchor peptides were purified and analyzed by MALDI-MS. The spectrum shown in Fig. 4 revealed ions at m/z 2009, 2080, 2486, 2528, 2557, and 2599. Observation of the signal withm/z 2009 was consistent with the calculated mass of anchor peptide linked tol-Ala-d-iGln-l-Lys(Gly1)-d-Ala. The compound with m/z 2080 was explained asl-Ala-d-iGln-l-Lys(Gly1)-d-Ala-d-Ala linked to the COOH-terminal threonine of surface proteins. Compounds with m/z 2486 and 2557 represented the disaccharide-linked species of the aforementioned anchor peptides, whereas the observation of ions at m/z 2528 and 2599 suggested N,O-6 diacetylation of muramoyl in similar structures. Thus, the data revealed that all anchor peptides were linked to the peptidoglycan of the femA mutant strain UK17 via monoglycyl cross-bridges. Strain BB308 carries a transposon insertion in the promoter region of the femAB operon, a mutation which is known to decrease the expression of both genes (18Berger-Bächi B. Barberis-Maino L. Strassle A. Kayser F.H. Mol. Gen. Genet. 1989; 219: 263-269Crossref PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar, 23Stranden A. Ehlert K. Labischinski H. Berger-Bächi B. J. Bacteriol. 1997; 179: 9-16Crossref PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar). In contrast to the femA and femB mutants analyzed above, strain BB308 synthesizes cross-bridges containing pentaglycyl, tetraglycyl-monoseryl (Gly4-Ser1), monoglycyl, and small amounts of triglycyl (26Maidhof H. Reinicke B. Blumel P. Berger-Bächi B. Labischinski H. J. Bacteriol. 1991; 173: 3507-3513Crossref PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar, 29Kopp U. Roos M. Wecke J. Labischinski H. Microb. Drug Resist. 1996; 2: 29-41Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). When subjected to MALDI-MS, anchor peptides purified from φ11 hydrolase-digested peptidoglycan of strain BB308 yielded four main ion clusters. For better analysis of the signals at m/z 2000–3000, the spectrum was drawn on an expanded scale in Fig. 5 B. Observation of ions with m/z 2266 and 2745 was consistent with the calculated mass of anchor peptides harboringl-Ala-d-iGln-l-Lys(Gly4Ser1)-d-Ala and MurNAc-[l-Ala-d-iGln-l-Lys(Gly4Ser1)-d-Ala]-(β1–4)-GlcNAc linked to the carboxyl of threonine. Anchor peptides linked to pentapeptide species via similar Gly4Ser1cross-bridges were also observed: m/z 2337 (l-Ala-d-iGln-l-Lys(Gly4Ser1)-d-Ala-d-Ala), 2815 (MurNAc-(l-Ala-d-iGln-l-Lys(Gly4Ser1)-d-Ala-d-Ala)-(β1–4)-GlcNAc), and 2859 (6-OAc-MurNAc-(l-Ala-d-iGln-l-Lys(Gly4Ser1)-d-Ala-d-Ala)-(β1–4)-GlcNAc). In addition, signals of anchor peptides were identified that harbored either wild-type pentaglycyl (m/z 2237, 2309, 2715, 2757, 2787, 2829) or monoglycyl cross-bridges (m/z 2007, 2080, 2529, 2601). Compounds with m/z 4370 and 4887 were due to incomplete CnBr cleavage of Seb-MH6-Cws, and their anchor structures were similar to those described for ions with m/z2266 and 2787. The femAX mutant strain UK31 has been generated by chemical mutagenesis of strain UK14 (femA) (29Kopp U. Roos M. Wecke J. Labischinski H. Microb. Drug Resist. 1996; 2: 29-41Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). The peptidoglycan of S. aureus UK31 displayed reduced peptidoglycan cross-linking as compared with its UK14 parent (63% as compared with 67% for UK14 and 76% for wild-type strain BB270) (29Kopp U. Roos M. Wecke J. Labischinski H. Microb. Drug Resist. 1996; 2: 29-41Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). In contrast to the cell wall of strain UK14, in which all cross-bridges consist of monoglycyl, about half of all peptidoglycan monomer isolated from S. aureus UK31 contains cross-bridges without glycine, in which the ε-amino of lysyl is directly linked to thed-alanyl at position four of a neighboring cell wall subunit. The remaining 50% is composed of monoglycyl cross-bridges, similar to the UK17 parent (29Kopp U. Roos M. Wecke J. Labischinski H. Microb. Drug Resist. 1996; 2: 29-41Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). MALDI-MS analysis of anchor peptides released from the peptidoglycan of UK31 with φ11 hydrolase treatment revealed prominent ions with m/z 1454, 2010, 2081, 2488, 2530, 2559, 3557, and 4184 (Fig. 6). The compound with m/z 1454 is likely a COOH-terminal degradation product of surface protein; its mass is consistent with the peptide sequence NH2-HHHHHHAQALPE (calculated mass of 1450 Da). The ion at m/z 3557 can be explained as a COOH-terminal peptide with a structure similar to that of m/z 1454 and an additional 16 upstream residues due to incomplete CnBr cleavage. The observed compound with m/z 2010 represented anchor peptide linked to the monoglycyl cross-bridge of a cell wall tetrapeptide (l-Ala-d-iGln-l-Lys(Gly1)-d-Ala). Ions with m/z 2081, 2488, 2530, 2559, and 2601 were explained as anchor peptide linked to monoglycyl cross-bridges with additional peptidoglycan structures: 2081 (l-Ala-d-iGln-l-Lys(Gly1)-d-Ala-d-Ala), 2488 (MurNAc-(l-Ala-d-iGln-l-Lys(Gly1)-d-Ala-D)-(β1–4)-GlcNAc), 2530 (6-OAc-MurNAc-(l-Ala-d-iGln-l-Lys(Gly1)-d-Ala)-(β1–4)-GlcNAc), 2559 (MurNAc-(l-Ala-d-iGln-l-Lys(Gly1)-d-Ala-d-Ala)-(β1–4)-GlcNAc), 2601 (6-OAc-MurNAc-(l-Ala-d-iGln-l-Lys(Gly1)-dAla-d-Ala)-(β1–4)-GlcNAc). None of the observed signals were consistent with anchor peptide structures in which the carboxyl of threonine was linked directly to the ε-amino of lysine. All bacterial peptidoglycan is synthesized from lipid-linked precursor molecules (10Ghuysen J.-M. Bacteriol. Rev. 1968; 32: 425-464Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 11Schleifer K.H. Kandler O. Bacteriol. Rev. 1972; 36: 407-477Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Penicillin binding proteins have evolved to cleave these precursors at the amide bond ofd-alanyl-d-alanine (9Ghuysen J.-M. Annu. Rev. Microbiol. 1991; 45: 37-67Crossref PubMed Scopus (491) Google Scholar). Even when compared with penicillin binding protein homologs from distantly related species, these enzymes share significant sequence and structural similarity (9Ghuysen J.-M. Annu. Rev. Microbiol. 1991; 45: 37-67Crossref PubMed Scopus (491) Google Scholar). In contrast to the conservation ofd-alanyl-d-alanine, the chemical nature of cross-bridges within bacterial peptidoglycans is highly variable. Nevertheless, the presence of a free amino group is a common feature (11Schleifer K.H. Kandler O. Bacteriol. Rev. 1972; 36: 407-477Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), and this element functions as a nucleophile to attack the acyl intermediate formed between the carbonyl of d-alanyl and the active site serine residue of PBPs. The nucleophilic attack results in the formation of a peptide bond between d-alanyl and the peptidoglycan cross-bridge as well as the regeneration of the hydroxyl at the active site serine (9Ghuysen J.-M. Annu. Rev. Microbiol. 1991; 45: 37-67Crossref PubMed Scopus (491) Google Scholar). In vitro, when tested with purified pentapeptide substrate and enzyme, several different nucleophiles can substitute for the free amino of the peptidoglycan cross-bridge, including hydroxylamine, alanine, glycine, and others (40Kozarich J.W. Strominger J.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1978; 253: 1272-1278Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). However, in vivo the transpeptidation reaction is known to proceed with great specificity, cross-linking only neighboring wall peptides (41Strominger J.L. Izaki K. Matsuhashi M. Tipper D.J. Fed. Proc. 1967; 26: 9-18PubMed Google Scholar). These observations suggest that the fidelity of the transpeptidation reaction may depend at least in part on a unique environment in which the free amino of the cross-bridge is the only available nucleophile. The sorting reaction of Gram-positive bacteria displays similarity to the penicillin-sensitive transpeptidation reaction (6Schneewind O. Fowler A. Faull K.F. Science. 1995; 268: 103-106Crossref PubMed Scopus (375) Google Scholar). Here, the substrate for proteolytic cleavage is the LPXTG motif of surface proteins, which is cleaved between the threonine (T) and the glycine (G) (5Navarre W.W. Schneewind O. Mol. Microbiol. 1994; 14: 115-121Crossref PubMed Scopus (306) Google Scholar). The nucleophilic amino group donor of the sorting reaction is identical to that of the transpeptidation reaction,i.e., the peptidoglycan cross-bridge. Because the LPXTG motif is found in sorting signals of many different surface proteins (42Fischetti V.A. Pancholi V. Schneewind O. Mol. Microbiol. 1990; 4: 1603-1605Crossref PubMed Scopus (315) Google Scholar), it seems likely that sortase, the enzyme proposed to catalyze this reaction, is structurally conserved between different Gram-positive bacteria. Here, we asked whether mutationally altered cross-bridges of the staphylococcal peptidoglycan can serve as substrates for the sorting reaction. The rate of surface protein precursor cleavage at the LPXTG motif was employed to measure this reaction. S. aureus strains carrying mutations in the fem genes displayed a decreased rate of precursor cleavage as compared with the wild-type strains, suggesting that the altered cross-bridges slowed the anchoring of surface proteins. We also revealed here the anchor structures of surface proteins expressed in S. aureus strains that carry mutations in various fem genes. The results showed that surface protein was linked to tri- and monoglycyl cross-bridges of peptidoglycan isolated from femB and femA mutant staphylococci, respectively. However, no surface protein was found linked directly to the ε-amino of lysyl within the cell wall of the femAXstrain UK31, indicating that not all cross-bridges serve as a substrate for the sorting reaction. S. aureus BB308 carries a transposon insertion in the promoter of the femAB operon (18Berger-Bächi B. Barberis-Maino L. Strassle A. Kayser F.H. Mol. Gen. Genet. 1989; 219: 263-269Crossref PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar). Peptidoglycan analysis of this strain revealed the presence of pentaglycyl, tetraglycyl-monoseryl, and monoglycyl as well as small amounts of triglycyl cross-bridges. Analysis of anchor peptides purified from the peptidoglycan of S. aureus BB308 showed that surface proteins were mostly linked to tetraglycyl-monoseryl as well as pentaglycyl. Although monoglycyl containing murein is known to be the most abundant species in strain BB308, we observed little surface protein anchoring to this cross-bridge, suggesting that the sortase activity of S. aureus preferred cross-bridges containing five residues. BB308 also contains small amounts of peptidoglycan with triglycyl cross-bridges; however, we could not identify surface protein linked to this species. This is likely due to the low abundance of triglycyl murein subunits in the peptidoglycan BB308 since the results from strain UT34–2 (femB) indicate that surface proteins can be linked to triglycyl amino donors. The loss of β-lactam resistance in fem mutants of strain BB270 suggests that the PBP2′ enzyme cannot efficiently recognize the altered peptidoglycan cross-bridges (20Berger-Bächi B. Trends Microbiol. 1994; 2: 309-389Abstract Full Text PDF Scopus (78) Google Scholar). This is corroborated by electron microscopic studies of fem strains that revealed gross defects in morphology as well as cell lysis (29Kopp U. Roos M. Wecke J. Labischinski H. Microb. Drug Resist. 1996; 2: 29-41Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). Furthermore, all fem strains contain reduced amounts of cross-linked peptidoglycan (29Kopp U. Roos M. Wecke J. Labischinski H. Microb. Drug Resist. 1996; 2: 29-41Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). Introduction of the femA orfemB mutation into strains that do not express the PBP2′ enzyme also caused significant changes in the amount of peptidoglycan cross-linking as well as cell wall physiology. Thus, similar to the sorting reaction, staphylococcal PBPs can employ different amino group donors for transpeptidation, although these cross-bridges cannot fully substitute for the wild-type pentaglycyl substrate. We thank Kym F. Faull for suggestions and discussion during the course of this work and laboratory members for critically reading this manuscript."

In vitro studies identify three essential elements of the TATA-less blr1 core promoter that confer cell type- and differentiation-specific expression in the B cells of both humans and mice, a functional promoter region (−36 with respect to the transcription start site), a NF-κB motif (+44), and a noncanonical octamer motif (+157). The importance of these sites was confirmed byin vivo studies in gene-targeted mice deficient of either Oct-2, Bob1, or both NF-κB subunits p50 and p52. In all of these animals, the expression of BLR1 was reduced or absent. In mice deficient only of p52/NF-κB, BLR1 expression was unaffected. Thus our data demonstrate that BLR1 is a target gene for Oct-2, Bob1, and members of the NF-κB/Rel family and provides a link to the impaired B cell functions in mice deficient for these factors.

Immunol. 1992; 22: 2795-2799Crossref PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar), and its homologues were cloned from murine and rat tissues (4Kaiser E. Förster R. Wolf I. Ebensperger C. Kuehl W.M. Lipp M.

FEBS Lett. 1993; 321: 173-178Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). Within the hematopoietic system, the expression of BLR1 is restricted to mature resting B cells and a subset of T helper memory cells (6Förster R. Emrich T. Kremmer E. Lipp M. Blood. 1994; 84: 830-840Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Disruption of the blr1 gene in mice revealed an essential role of this receptor in directing lymphocyte migration (7Förster R. Mattis A.E. Kremmer E. Wolf E. Brem G. Lipp M. Cell. 1996; 87: 1037-1047Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (951) Google Scholar).Blr1 −/− mice lack inguinal lymph nodes and possess either none or a significantly reduced number of morphologically altered Peyer's patches. The migration of B cells to Peyer's patches and splenic follicles was severely impaired in these animals, resulting in significant morphological alterations of the primary lymphoid follicles and lack of functional germinal centers.The regulatory mechanisms directing cell type- and differentiation-specific expression of genes to mature B cells have not been resolved. Candidate transcription factors are members of the NF-κB/Rel family that includes several factors; among these a heterodimer of p50 (NFκB1) and p65 (RelA) is one of the prevailing forms in mammalian cells. All members of the NF-κB family share a common amino-terminal Rel homology domain, which is required for dimerization as well as for DNA binding. Upon induction by various stimuli, NF-κB factors activate a wide array of genes, including those involved in the early immune response (for review see Ref.8Baeuerle P.A. Baltimore D. Cell. 1996; 87: 13-20Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2917) Google Scholar).The octamer consensus sequence, 5′-ATGCAAAT-3′, was initially identified as an essential regulatory element in promoters and enhancers of the immunoglobulin genes but is also present in promoters of numerous ubiquitous genes (for review see Ref. 9Verrijzer C.P. Van der Vliet P.C. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1993; 1173: 1-21Crossref PubMed Scopus (243) Google Scholar). The octamer motif is recognized by the ubiquitously expressed transcription factor Oct-1 and by the B lymphocyte-restricted factor Oct-2. Both are highly homologous in their bipartite DNA-binding POU domain (for review see Ref. 10Herr W. Cleary M.A. Genes Dev. 1995; 9: 1679-1693Crossref PubMed Scopus (345) Google Scholar). As both Oct-1 and Oct-2 bind equally well to the octamer sequence, it remains unclear whether Oct-2 specifically directs the expression of octamer-dependent genes in B lymphocytes. Several observations suggest the existence of additional B cell-restricted cofactors essential for an octamer-dependent gene activation in B cells. Recently, a novel B cell-specific coactivator of octamer binding factors termed Bob1 (OBF-1/OCA-B) was identified and cloned from human (11Gstaiger M. Knoepfel L. Georgiev O. Schaffner W. Hovens C.M. Nature. 1995; 373: 360-362Crossref PubMed Scopus (285) Google Scholar, 12Strubin M. Newell J.W. Matthias P. Cell. 1995; 80: 497-506Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (351) Google Scholar, 13Luo Y.

Nucleic Acids Res. 1996; 24: 1913-1920Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar) tissues. Bob1 interacts with the POU domains of either Oct-1 or Oct-2 forming a ternary complex on DNA. Upon the binding of Bob1, Oct-1 is converted from an ubiquitous to a lymphocyte-specific factor and shows increased specificity of DNA binding (16Gstaiger M. Georgiev O. van Leeuwen H. van der Vliet P. Schaffner W. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 2781-2790Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar).Although in gene-targeted mice Oct-2 is dispensable in the antigen-independent stage of B lymphocyte development, B cell maturation seems to be severely impaired in these animals (17Corcoran L.M. Karvelas M. Nossal G.J. Ye Z.S. Jacks T. Baltimore D. Genes Dev. 1993; 7: 570-582Crossref PubMed Scopus (238) Google Scholar). Recently, two Oct-2-regulated genes, CD36 (18König H. Pfisterer P. Corcoran L.M. Wirth T. Genes Dev. 1995; 9: 1598-1607Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar) and CRISP-3 (19Pfisterer P. König H. Hess J. Lipowsky G. Haendler B. Schleuning W.D. Wirth T. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 6160-6168Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar), have been identified. As their function in the immune system is not clear, there might be yet undiscovered targets of Oct-2 regulation that are relevant for B cell maturation. Data presented here demonstrate that in B cells regulation of the BLR1 gene is cooperatively controlled by NF-κB, Oct-2, and Bob1. The observation that the B cell homing chemokine receptor, BLR1, is a target for Bob1 and Oct-2 links these factors to the molecule with an essential function in the immune system.DISCUSSIONWe isolated and characterized the promoter for the BLR1gene. BLR1 transcription initiation starts at a single site, but the promoter sequence lacks classical features like a TATA box or an initiator-like sequence. The core promoter sequence required for basic and tissue-specific expression was found to reside in a fragment encompassing a region from position −78 to +215 with respect to the transcriptional start site. By mutational analysis, it was found that this fragment harbors three regions essential for promoter activity: 1) a site termed FPR located at position −36, which suggests that it may be important for the formation of the preinitiation complex; 2) a NF-κB site; and 3) a noncanonical octamer sequence. The latter is the key determinant for BLR1 promoter activity, because a mutation abrogating binding of Oct factors resulted in a complete promoter inactivation. Available evidence suggests that NF-κB, Bob1, and Oct-2 factors act in a synergistic fashion to regulateBLR1 promoter activity (see Fig. 2). It was reported that the binding of NF-κB p50/p65 subunits to DNA introduces a bend into the DNA molecule (27Schreck R. Zorbas H. Winnacker E.L. Baeuerle P.A. Nucleic Acids Res. 1990; 18: 6497-6502Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). Taking into consideration the location of the essential binding sites for NF-κB, Oct, and the FPR in BLR1 promoter, it is tempting to speculate that this NF-κB-mediated DNA bending brings FPR and the octamer element into close proximity to each other. This would enable the interaction of octamer-bound factors to the protein(s) bound to FPR. The importance of this interaction is substantiated by the evidence that Oct-2 may facilitate the formation of the preinitiation complex (28Arnosti D.N. Merino A. Reinberg D. Schaffner W. EMBO J. 1993; 12: 157-166Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). Furthermore, Oct-2 can interact with the TATA box-binding protein TBP (29Zwilling S. Annweiler A. Wirth T. Nucleic Acids Res. 1994; 22: 1655-1662Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). The described regulation of the BLR1 promoter activity is the first example for the cooperative regulation via NF-κB and octamer binding factors from a position downstream of the transcriptional start site.We demonstrated that the B cell-specific coactivator Bob1 potentiates Oct-2-mediated activation of the blr1 promoter. Bob1 has its own activation domain (11Gstaiger M. Knoepfel L. Georgiev O. Schaffner W. Hovens C.M. Nature. 1995; 373: 360-362Crossref PubMed Scopus (285) Google Scholar), but the mechanism of activation is not fully understood. It is suggested that Bob1 acts as a bridge, connecting the octamer-bound transcription factor to components of the TFIID complex (12Strubin M. Newell J.W. Matthias P. Cell. 1995; 80: 497-506Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (351) Google Scholar). Therefore, this interaction may also contribute to the regulation of the BLR1 promoter function.The ternary complex of Bob1 with octamer factors shows higher selectivity in recognition of the octamer sequences, as Oct-1 or Oct-2 alone (16Gstaiger M. Georgiev O. van Leeuwen H. van der Vliet P. Schaffner W. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 2781-2790Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar). The octamer site in the BLR1 promoter is a noncanonical motif, with a substitution T/A in the second position in the human promoter accompanied in the murine counterpart by an additional substitution G/A in the third position. It was shown that the fifth base in the octamer site is most critical for the formation of the ternary complex, and it should be occupied by adenosine (16Gstaiger M. Georgiev O. van Leeuwen H. van der Vliet P. Schaffner W. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 2781-2790Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar). It was suggested that the first three nucleotides of the octamer sequence are also involved in the recognition of the octamer sequence. However, our data indicate that the blr1 promoter is activated by Bob1, implying that within the context of this gene the second and the third bases of the octamer motif are not necessarily required for the activation.Analysis of mice with targeted deletion of Oct-2, Bob1, or NF-κB provides further evidence for the critical requirement of these factors for the expression of BLR1. Like Oct-2-deficient mice, Bob1 knockout mice (30Kim U. Qin X.F. Gong S. Stevens S. Luo Y. Nussenzweig M. Roeder R.G. Nature. 1996; 383: 542-547Crossref PubMed Scopus (212) Google Scholar, 31Schubart D.B. Rolink A. Kosco-Vilbois M.H. Botteri F. Matthias P.

The same phenotype is shared by mice with the targeted disruption of p52/NF-κB2 (33Franzoso G. Carlson L. Poljak L. Shores E.W. Epstein S. Leonardi A. Grinberg A. Tran T. Scharton-Kersten T. Anver M.

In p50/p52 double knockout mice development of B cells is halted at stage B220low, IgM+, CD23−. Cells with this phenotype are also found in normal spleens, although at low frequency. In wild-type animals, these cells express BLR1 at the same level as observed for mature B cells, 2R. Förster, unpublished data. but we could not detect BLR1 on corresponding cells derived from double knockout mice. The absence of germinal centers is also a hallmark of the phenotype of blr1-deficient mice. Following a T cell-dependent antigenic challenge, B cells become activated but fail to migrate into B cell follicles of the spleen. As a consequence, germinal centers do not develop (7Förster R.

Thus, the severely reduced expression of BLR1 in both Bob1 and p50/p52 null mice may contribute to the absence of germinal center reactions in these animals as a consequence of impaired B lymphocyte migration. BLR1/CXCR5 is the receptor of the recently identified CXC chemokine BCA-1/BLC (1Gunn M.D. Ngo V.N. Ansel K.M. Ekland E.H. Cyster J.G. Williams L.T.

Immunol. 1992; 22: 2795-2799Crossref PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar), and its homologues were cloned from murine and rat tissues (4Kaiser E. Förster R. Wolf I. Ebensperger C. Kuehl W.M. Lipp M.

FEBS Lett. 1993; 321: 173-178Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). Within the hematopoietic system, the expression of BLR1 is restricted to mature resting B cells and a subset of T helper memory cells (6Förster R. Emrich T. Kremmer E. Lipp M. Blood. 1994; 84: 830-840Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Disruption of the blr1 gene in mice revealed an essential role of this receptor in directing lymphocyte migration (7Förster R. Mattis A.E. Kremmer E. Wolf E. Brem G. Lipp M. Cell. 1996; 87: 1037-1047Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (951) Google Scholar).Blr1 −/− mice lack inguinal lymph nodes and possess either none or a significantly reduced number of morphologically altered Peyer's patches. The migration of B cells to Peyer's patches and splenic follicles was severely impaired in these animals, resulting in significant morphological alterations of the primary lymphoid follicles and lack of functional germinal centers. The regulatory mechanisms directing cell type- and differentiation-specific expression of genes to mature B cells have not been resolved. Candidate transcription factors are members of the NF-κB/Rel family that includes several factors; among these a heterodimer of p50 (NFκB1) and p65 (RelA) is one of the prevailing forms in mammalian cells. All members of the NF-κB family share a common amino-terminal Rel homology domain, which is required for dimerization as well as for DNA binding. Upon induction by various stimuli, NF-κB factors activate a wide array of genes, including those involved in the early immune response (for review see Ref.8Baeuerle P.A. Baltimore D. Cell. 1996; 87: 13-20Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2917) Google Scholar). The octamer consensus sequence, 5′-ATGCAAAT-3′, was initially identified as an essential regulatory element in promoters and enhancers of the immunoglobulin genes but is also present in promoters of numerous ubiquitous genes (for review see Ref. 9Verrijzer C.P. Van der Vliet P.C. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1993; 1173: 1-21Crossref PubMed Scopus (243) Google Scholar). The octamer motif is recognized by the ubiquitously expressed transcription factor Oct-1 and by the B lymphocyte-restricted factor Oct-2. Both are highly homologous in their bipartite DNA-binding POU domain (for review see Ref. 10Herr W. Cleary M.A. Genes Dev. 1995; 9: 1679-1693Crossref PubMed Scopus (345) Google Scholar). As both Oct-1 and Oct-2 bind equally well to the octamer sequence, it remains unclear whether Oct-2 specifically directs the expression of octamer-dependent genes in B lymphocytes. Several observations suggest the existence of additional B cell-restricted cofactors essential for an octamer-dependent gene activation in B cells. Recently, a novel B cell-specific coactivator of octamer binding factors termed Bob1 (OBF-1/OCA-B) was identified and cloned from human (11Gstaiger M. Knoepfel L. Georgiev O. Schaffner W. Hovens C.M. Nature. 1995; 373: 360-362Crossref PubMed Scopus (285) Google Scholar, 12Strubin M. Newell J.W. Matthias P. Cell. 1995; 80: 497-506Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (351) Google Scholar, 13Luo Y. Roeder R.G. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 4115-4124Crossref PubMed Scopus (249) Google Scholar) and murine (14Pfisterer P. Zwilling S. Hess J. Wirth T. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 29870-29880Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar, 15Schubart D.B. Sauter P. Massa S. Friedl E.M. Schwarzenbach H. Matthias P. Nucleic Acids Res. 1996; 24: 1913-1920Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar) tissues. Bob1 interacts with the POU domains of either Oct-1 or Oct-2 forming a ternary complex on DNA. Upon the binding of Bob1, Oct-1 is converted from an ubiquitous to a lymphocyte-specific factor and shows increased specificity of DNA binding (16Gstaiger M. Georgiev O. van Leeuwen H. van der Vliet P. Schaffner W. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 2781-2790Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar). Although in gene-targeted mice Oct-2 is dispensable in the antigen-independent stage of B lymphocyte development, B cell maturation seems to be severely impaired in these animals (17Corcoran L.M. Karvelas M. Nossal G.J. Ye Z.S. Jacks T. Baltimore D. Genes Dev. 1993; 7: 570-582Crossref PubMed Scopus (238) Google Scholar). Recently, two Oct-2-regulated genes, CD36 (18König H. Pfisterer P. Corcoran L.M. Wirth T. Genes Dev. 1995; 9: 1598-1607Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar) and CRISP-3 (19Pfisterer P. König H. Hess J. Lipowsky G. Haendler B. Schleuning W.D. Wirth T. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 6160-6168Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar), have been identified. As their function in the immune system is not clear, there might be yet undiscovered targets of Oct-2 regulation that are relevant for B cell maturation. Data presented here demonstrate that in B cells regulation of the BLR1 gene is cooperatively controlled by NF-κB, Oct-2, and Bob1. The observation that the B cell homing chemokine receptor, BLR1, is a target for Bob1 and Oct-2 links these factors to the molecule with an essential function in the immune system. DISCUSSIONWe isolated and characterized the promoter for the BLR1gene. BLR1 transcription initiation starts at a single site, but the promoter sequence lacks classical features like a TATA box or an initiator-like sequence. The core promoter sequence required for basic and tissue-specific expression was found to reside in a fragment encompassing a region from position −78 to +215 with respect to the transcriptional start site. By mutational analysis, it was found that this fragment harbors three regions essential for promoter activity: 1) a site termed FPR located at position −36, which suggests that it may be important for the formation of the preinitiation complex; 2) a NF-κB site; and 3) a noncanonical octamer sequence. The latter is the key determinant for BLR1 promoter activity, because a mutation abrogating binding of Oct factors resulted in a complete promoter inactivation. Available evidence suggests that NF-κB, Bob1, and Oct-2 factors act in a synergistic fashion to regulateBLR1 promoter activity (see Fig. 2). It was reported that the binding of NF-κB p50/p65 subunits to DNA introduces a bend into the DNA molecule (27Schreck R. Zorbas H. Winnacker E.L. Baeuerle P.A. Nucleic Acids Res. 1990; 18: 6497-6502Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). Taking into consideration the location of the essential binding sites for NF-κB, Oct, and the FPR in BLR1 promoter, it is tempting to speculate that this NF-κB-mediated DNA bending brings FPR and the octamer element into close proximity to each other. This would enable the interaction of octamer-bound factors to the protein(s) bound to FPR. The importance of this interaction is substantiated by the evidence that Oct-2 may facilitate the formation of the preinitiation complex (28Arnosti D.N. Merino A. Reinberg D. Schaffner W. EMBO J. 1993; 12: 157-166Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). Furthermore, Oct-2 can interact with the TATA box-binding protein TBP (29Zwilling S. Annweiler A. Wirth T. Nucleic Acids Res. 1994; 22: 1655-1662Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). The described regulation of the BLR1 promoter activity is the first example for the cooperative regulation via NF-κB and octamer binding factors from a position downstream of the transcriptional start site.We demonstrated that the B cell-specific coactivator Bob1 potentiates Oct-2-mediated activation of the blr1 promoter. Bob1 has its own activation domain (11Gstaiger M. Knoepfel L. Georgiev O. Schaffner W. Hovens C.M. Nature. 1995; 373: 360-362Crossref PubMed Scopus (285) Google Scholar), but the mechanism of activation is not fully understood. It is suggested that Bob1 acts as a bridge, connecting the octamer-bound transcription factor to components of the TFIID complex (12Strubin M. Newell J.W. Matthias P. Cell. 1995; 80: 497-506Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (351) Google Scholar). Therefore, this interaction may also contribute to the regulation of the BLR1 promoter function.The ternary complex of Bob1 with octamer factors shows higher selectivity in recognition of the octamer sequences, as Oct-1 or Oct-2 alone (16Gstaiger M. Georgiev O. van Leeuwen H. van der Vliet P. Schaffner W. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 2781-2790Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar). The octamer site in the BLR1 promoter is a noncanonical motif, with a substitution T/A in the second position in the human promoter accompanied in the murine counterpart by an additional substitution G/A in the third position. It was shown that the fifth base in the octamer site is most critical for the formation of the ternary complex, and it should be occupied by adenosine (16Gstaiger M. Georgiev O. van Leeuwen H. van der Vliet P. Schaffner W. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 2781-2790Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar). It was suggested that the first three nucleotides of the octamer sequence are also involved in the recognition of the octamer sequence. However, our data indicate that the blr1 promoter is activated by Bob1, implying that within the context of this gene the second and the third bases of the octamer motif are not necessarily required for the activation.Analysis of mice with targeted deletion of Oct-2, Bob1, or NF-κB provides further evidence for the critical requirement of these factors for the expression of BLR1. Like Oct-2-deficient mice, Bob1 knockout mice (30Kim U. Qin X.F. Gong S. Stevens S. Luo Y. Nussenzweig M. Roeder R.G.

https://openalex.org/W2055843550,"We have recently shown that insulin-like growth factor (IGF)-binding protein 5 forms ternary complexes with IGF-I or IGF-II and the acid-labile subunit (ALS) (Twigg, S. M., and Baxter, R. C. (1998) J. Biol. Chem. 273, 6074–6079). Because IGF-binding protein 3 (IGFBP-3) binds to ALS through its basic carboxyl-terminal domain, we tested whether a homologous region present in IGFBP-5 is involved in IGFBP-5 binding to ALS. Chimeric peptides were generated by carboxyl-terminal domain interchange between recombinant human IGF-BP-5 and IGFBP-6, producing two IGFBP peptides designated 5-5-6 and 6-6-5. Determined by immunoprecipitation and by Superose chromatography, 6-6-5 formed ternary complexes, albeit less potently than IGF-BP-5. In contrast, 5-5-6, like IGFBP-6, did not form ternary complexes by these methods. Whereas 6-6-5, like IGFBP-6, had a marked preference for binary complex formation with IGF-II rather than IGF-I, it formed ternary complexes more efficiently with IGF-I, like IGF-BP-5. The glycosaminoglycans heparin and heparan sulfate bind to IGFBP-5 through its basic carboxyl-terminal domain. At high concentrations, these glycosaminoglycans inhibited ALS binding to binary complexed IGF-BP-5. In addition, in the absence of IGFs, IGFBP-5, a synthetic peptide representing the basic carboxyl-terminal sequence IGFBP-5(201–218), and the corresponding IGFBP-3 basic sequence IGFBP-3(215–232), competed weakly for ALS binding to covalent IGF–IGFBP-5 complex, as did a random-sequence synthetic peptide with the same composition as IGFBP-5(201–218). These findings are consistent with the basic carboxyl-terminal domain on IGFBP-5 being the principal site in IGFBP-5 that binds to ALS. We have recently shown that insulin-like growth factor (IGF)-binding protein 5 forms ternary complexes with IGF-I or IGF-II and the acid-labile subunit (ALS) (Twigg, S. M., and Baxter, R. C.

These findings are consistent with the basic carboxyl-terminal domain on IGFBP-5 being the principal site in IGFBP-5 that binds to ALS. insulin-like growth factor acid-labile subunit IGF-binding protein glycosaminoglycan recombinant human nonsense. The insulin-like growth factors IGF-I1 and IGF-II are anabolic peptides, which regulate cell and tissue growth and glycemic control. They bind to six well characterized high affinity IGF-binding proteins (IGFBP-1 to IGFBP-6) (1Le Roith D. New Engl. J. Med. 1997; 336: 633-640Crossref PubMed Scopus (567) Google Scholar, 2Jones J.I.

The IGFBPs can be considered to have three domains on the basis of amino acid sequence comparisons (4Kiefer M. Masiarz F. Bauer D. Zapf J. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 9043-9049Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar,5Kiefer M.C. Ioh R.S. Bauer D.M. Zapf J. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1991; 176: 219-225Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). They share common structural features with relatively conserved amino- and carboxyl-terminal domains, including 10–12 conserved cysteine residues at the amino terminus and six conserved cysteine residues at the carboxyl terminus (6Rechler M.M. Brown A.L. Growth Regul. 1992; 2: 55-68PubMed Google Scholar). The midregion domain of each IGFBP is more variable in length and amino acid composition. We recently reported that IGFBP-5, like IGFBP-3, forms ternary complexes with IGF-I or IGF-II and ALS (7Twigg S.M. Baxter R.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 6074-6079Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (163) Google Scholar). IGFBP-1, -2, -4, and -6 do not form ternary complexes (7Twigg S.M. Baxter R.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 6074-6079Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (163) Google Scholar). IGFBP-5 and IGFBP-3 share a highly homologous 18-amino acid region in their carboxyl-terminal domain, IGFBP-5(201–218) and IGFBP-3(215–232) respectively, of which 10 amino acids are basic and none are acidic (6Rechler M.M. Brown A.L. Growth Regul. 1992; 2: 55-68PubMed Google Scholar). This region is known to be of major importance for IGFBP-3 binding to ALS (8Firth S.M. Ganeshprasad U. Baxter R.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 2631-2638Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar), as well as cell-surface binding and nuclear localization (9Schedlich L. Young T.F. Firth S.M. Baxter R.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 18347-18352Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (230) Google Scholar). IGFBP-3 mutagenesis studies involving substitution of residues 228–232 (KGRKR) with the corresponding residues of IGFBP-1 (MDGEA), have shown an order of magnitude loss of affinity for ALS in the presence of IGF-I or IGF-II (8Firth S.M. Ganeshprasad U. Baxter R.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 2631-2638Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar). The highly basic carboxyl-terminal region in IGFBP-5 is a known site of interaction with glycosaminoglycans (GAGs) (10Arai T. Parker A. Busby Jr., W. Clemmons D.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 20388-20393Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 11Booth B.A. Boes M. Andress D.L. Dake B.L. Kiefer M.C. Maack C. Linhardt R.J. Bar K. Caldwell E.E.O. Weiler J. Bar R.S. Growth Regul. 1995; 5: 1-17PubMed Google Scholar), which bind to IGFBP-5 via the only functional IGFBP-5 heparin binding motif, at amino acids 206–211 (KRKQCK) (10Arai T. Parker A. Busby Jr., W. Clemmons D.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 20388-20393Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). We tested whether the basic carboxyl-terminal domain in IGFBP-5 binds to ALS using two complementary approaches. We first determined whether this domain is involved in ALS binding with the use of IGFBP chimeras in which the carboxyl-terminal domains of IGFBP-5 and IGFBP-6 are interchanged. Second, to further localize the IGFBP-5 region that binds to ALS, we have used reagents that are known to bind to or potentially compete with the basic carboxyl-terminal domain of IGFBP-5 as inhibitors of IGFBP-5 binding to ALS. These studies demonstrate that IGFBP-5 binds to ALS through its basic carboxyl-terminal domain. Recombinant human (rh) IGFBP-5 and rhIGFBP-6 were derived from yeast expression systems as described previously (12Kiefer M.C. Schmid C. Waldvogel M. Schlapfer I. Futo E. Masiariz F.R. Green K. Barr P.J. Zapf J. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 12692-12699Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Natural human IGFBP-3 (13Martin J.L. Baxter R.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 8754-8760Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and ALS (14Baxter R.C. Martin J.L. Beniac V.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 11843-11848Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) were purified as described. Human IGF-I and IGF-II were generous gifts from Genentech (South San Francisco, CA) and Kabi Peptide Hormones (Stockholm, Sweden), respectively. The rabbit anti-human ALS antiserum AL2/2 was raised by immunization with serum-derived ALS (7Twigg S.M. Baxter R.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 6074-6079Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (163) Google Scholar). Disuccinimidyl suberate was purchased from Pierce. The glycosaminoglycans heparin, heparan sulfate, dermatan sulfate, chondroitin sulfate A, and bovine serum albumin were purchased from Sigma. The following radiolabeled iodinated tracers were prepared as described previously: ALS (14Baxter R.C. Martin J.L. Beniac V.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 11843-11848Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), IGF-I (7Twigg S.M. Baxter R.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 6074-6079Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (163) Google Scholar), IGF-II (7Twigg S.M. Baxter R.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 6074-6079Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (163) Google Scholar), and IGF-I-IGFBP-5 and IGF-I-IGFBP-3 cross-linked tracers (7Twigg S.M. Baxter R.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 6074-6079Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (163) Google Scholar). The chimeras were constructed based on the designated domains of the IGFBPs as described previously (5Kiefer M.C. Ioh R.S. Bauer D.M. Zapf J. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1991; 176: 219-225Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). The structural domains of IGFBP-5 and IGFBP-6 used as a basis for production of the chimeras, are shown in Fig. 1 A. For generation of the chimeras, pBS24Ub-IGFBP-5 and pBS24Ub-IGFBP-6 (12Kiefer M.C. Schmid C. Waldvogel M. Schlapfer I. Futo E. Masiariz F.R. Green K. Barr P.J. Zapf J. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 12692-12699Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) were digested withBamHI and SalI. The pBS24 plasmid was gel-purified and saved for the final ligation step, as described below. The ∼2-kilobase DNA fragments encoding ubiquitin fused to IGFBP-5 or IGFBP-6 were also gel-purified and ligated toBamHI/SalI-digested pUC18 to generate pUC18Ub-IGFBP-5 and pUC18Ub-IGFBP-6, respectively. These plasmids were subsequently digested with ApaI and SalI, which released ∼250-base pair DNA fragments encoding the third domain of each IGFBP. Both domain 3-encoding DNA fragments and the pUC18 plasmids were gel-purified and reciprocally ligated to generate plasmids encoding ubiquitin fused to 1) the first two domains of IGFBP-5 and the third domain of IGFBP-6, termed pUC18Ub-IGFBP-5-5-6, and 2) the first two domains of IGFBP-5 and the third domain of IGFBP-5, termed pUC18Ub-IGFBP-6-6-5. These resulting plasmids were then digested with BamHI and SalI. The ∼2-kilobase DNA fragments encoding ubiquitin fused to the IGFBP chimeras were gel-purified and ligated toBamHI/SalI-digested pBS24 (purified in the first step of the construction) to yield pBS24Ub-IGFBP-5-5-6 and pBS24Ub-IGFBP-6-6-5. These plasmids were used for yeast transformation, and the chimeric IGFBPs were expressed as fusion proteins with ubiquitin. The ubiquitin was removed by proteolysis, and the IGFBPs were purified as described (12Kiefer M.C. Schmid C. Waldvogel M. Schlapfer I. Futo E. Masiariz F.R. Green K. Barr P.J. Zapf J. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 12692-12699Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Synthetic 18-amino acid peptides were generated corresponding to the carboxyl-terminal basic regions at IGFBP-5(201–218) (RKGFYKRKQCKPSRGRKR) and IGFBP-3(215–232) (KKGFYKKKQCRPSKGRKR) and the corresponding amino acids of IGFBP-6(168–185) (HRGFYRKRQCRSSQGQRR). These peptides are designated Peptide 5, Peptide 3, and Peptide 6, respectively. A control, nonsense peptide, termed Peptide ns5, was produced using the same amino acid content as Peptide 5, but as a randomly generated amino acid sequence (KCRSKFRRPKYKGQRKGR). Peptides were synthesized by Chiron Technologies Pty. Ltd. (Clayton, Victoria, Australia) by the solid phase Fmoc (N-(9-fluorenyl)methoxycarbonyl) chemistry method, cleaved into a trifluroroacetic acid/scavenger mixture, dried down, and purified by reverse-phase high pressure liquid chromatography, using a gradient of increasing acetonitrile for elution. After lyophilization, the identity of the purified peptide was confirmed by ion spray mass spectrometry and the purity by analytical reverse-phase high pressure liquid chromatography. This was performed essentially as described previously (15Martin J.L. Willetts K.E. Baxter R.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 4124-4130Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In brief, IGFBP samples were incubated with IGF-I or IGF-II radiolabeled tracers at ∼50 pg/tube for 2 h at 21 °C in binding buffer (50 mm sodium phosphate buffer, pH 6.5, with 0.25 g/liter bovine serum albumin) in a final volume of 300 μl. Bound radioactivity was separated from free by the addition of 1 ml of cold charcoal suspension (10 g/liter) in binding buffer plus 0.2 g/liter protamine sulfate, incubating for 4 min at 4 °C, and then centrifuging for 10 min at 2000 rpm. For competitive binding studies, either rhIGFBP-5 (1 ng/tube for IGF-I tracer and IGF-II tracer), rhIGFBP-6 (10 ng/tube for IGF-I tracer and 1 ng/tube for IGF-II tracer), 5-5-6 (1 ng/tube for IGF-I and IGF-II tracer), or 6-6-5 (25 ng/tube for IGF-I and IGF-II tracer) was incubated with IGF tracer in the presence of unlabeled IGF-I or IGF-II in the range 0.01–100 ng per 300-μl reaction volume, and unbound tracer was removed by adsorption to charcoal as described above. This was performed essentially as described previously (7Twigg S.M. Baxter R.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 6074-6079Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (163) Google Scholar). Increasing amounts of rhIGFBP-5 (0.05–10 ng) were added to IGF-I or IGF-II tracer (each ∼50 pg/tube) and incubated at 22 °C for 2 h with or without 25 ng of ALS per tube, in a total of 300 μl of buffer as described previously (7Twigg S.M. Baxter R.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 6074-6079Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (163) Google Scholar). Affinity-purified rabbit anti-human ALS antiserum AL2/2 was added to precipitate the complex. Precipitating goat anti-rabbit immunoglobulin and then polyethylene glycol were sequentially added, tubes were centrifuged, and the precipitated complex was counted in a gamma counter (7Twigg S.M. Baxter R.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 6074-6079Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (163) Google Scholar). For competition studies involving IGF-I tracer, rhIGFBP-5 or 6-6-5 (0.1–10 ng/tube) was added to IGF-I tracer (∼50 pg/tube) and ALS at 25 ng/tube. Heparin, 25 μg/ml, was added in some tubes. The mixture was incubated in a total of 300 μl of the phosphate buffer as used in the ternary complex formation assay. The precipitation and counting protocol used was exactly the same as for the immunoprecipitation assay described above. For competition assays involving cross-linked tracer, IGF-I tracer cross-linked to IGFBP-5 (7Twigg S.M. Baxter R.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 6074-6079Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (163) Google Scholar) was added at a constant amount of 10,000 cpm/tube to 20 ng of ALS. When an IGFBP was used in competition, increasing amounts were added over the range of 0.05–250 ng/tube (to 1000 ng/tube for IGFBP-3), with or without IGF-I or IGF-II (100 ng/tube). In equivalent formats, either heparin, heparan sulfate, dermatan sulfate, chondroitin sulfate A, or one of the synthetic peptides (Peptide 3, Peptide 5, Peptide 6, or Peptide ns5) was added to the reagents described above at the concentrations shown in the respective figures. The mixture was incubated in a total of 300 μl of the phosphate buffer as used in the ternary complex formation assay. The conditions used for precipitation of the ternary complex and subsequent counting were exactly the same as for the immunoprecipitation assay described above. The method used is described in the original description of rhIGFBP-5 ternary complex formation (7Twigg S.M. Baxter R.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 6074-6079Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (163) Google Scholar). The Superose-12 column was calibrated with IGF-I tracer (7.6 kDa, peaking in fraction 34); IGF-I tracer cross-linked to IGFBP-3 (approximately 50 kDa), which mainly eluted in fractions 26–27, peaking in fraction 27; and IGFBP-3 in ternary complex with IGF-I tracer and ALS, which eluted mainly in fractions 23–25, peaking in fraction 24. By nonreducing SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, the IGFBPs were seen as silver-stained bands at ∼32 kDa for rhIGFBP-5 and ∼27 kDa for rhIGFBP-6, both as previously reported (12Kiefer M.C. Schmid C. Waldvogel M. Schlapfer I. Futo E. Masiariz F.R. Green K. Barr P.J. Zapf J. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 12692-12699Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), and at ∼31 kDa for the 5-5-6 chimera and ∼28 kDa for the 6-6-5 chimera, averaged from duplicate gels (Fig. 2). In all lanes, lightly staining bands were also present at higher molecular mass, consistent with dimerization. Dimerization has previously been described for rhIGFBP-5 and rhIGFBP-6 (12Kiefer M.C. Schmid C. Waldvogel M. Schlapfer I. Futo E. Masiariz F.R. Green K. Barr P.J. Zapf J. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 12692-12699Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and for other IGFBPs (16Zapf J.

Binoux M. Clemmons D.R. Endocrinology. 1989; 125: 773-777Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar) using these methods. Because IGF binding is necessary for high affinity ALS binding to IGFBP-3 (14Baxter R.C. Martin J.L. Beniac V.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 11843-11848Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), we first compared IGF-I and IGF-II tracer binding to that by rhIGFBP-5, rhIGFBP-6, and the chimeric proteins (Fig. 3, A and B). rhIGFBP-5 and rhIGFBP-6 bound IGF-I and IGF-II with relative potencies consistent with previous studies (12Kiefer M.C. Schmid C. Waldvogel M. Schlapfer I. Futo E. Masiariz F.R. Green K. Barr P.J. Zapf J. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 12692-12699Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 18Martin J.L. Coverly J.A. Baxter R.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 11470-11477Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The 5-5-6 chimera bound IGF-I and IGF-II with high potency, with some preference for IGF-II binding. The 6-6-5 chimera bound both IGFs less well than native rhIGFBP-5 and rhIGFBP-6. A marked preference for IGF-II binding over IGF-I binary complex formation was seen for the 6-6-5 chimera, more so even than was seen for rhIGFBP-6. Competitive binding curves (Fig. 3, C and D) with IGF tracer and IGFBP were generated in the presence of increasing IGF-I (for IGF-I tracer) or IGF-II (for IGF-II tracer), and the 50% effective concentration for tracer displacement (EC50) for each IGFBP was determined as shown in Table I. The EC50values for all the IGFBPs tested were lower for IGF-II binding than for IGF-I, with the greatest difference seen for the 6-6-5 chimera, for which a value could not be determined for IGF-I.Table ISummary of competition binding assays with 125I-IGF-I,125I-IGF-II, and IGF-I and IGF-II ligandsEC50IGF-IIGF-IIng/mlrhIGFBP-50.25 ± 0.040.23 ± 0.055–5-61.03 ± 0.090.77 ± 0.156–6-5ND (≫100)12.7 ± 1.3rhIGFBP-614.6 ± 1.50.97 ± 0.21The effective concentrations (EC50), in ng/ml (mean ± S.D.), of IGF-I or IGF-II that caused half-maximal displacement of IGF-I or IGF-II tracer, respectively, in the presence of each IGFBP are shown.

Open table in a new tab The effective concentrations (EC50), in ng/ml (mean ± S.D.), of IGF-I or IGF-II that caused half-maximal displacement of IGF-I or IGF-II tracer, respectively, in the presence of each IGFBP are shown. An EC50 could not be accurately determined (ND) for the 6–6-5 chimera with IGF-I tracer. Calculations were derived from four independent experiments. In this assay, IGF-I or IGF-II radiolabeled tracers were added in the presence of ALS and increasing concentrations of IGFBP. Ternary complexes formed were precipitated by the addition of ALS antiserum, and then radioactivity in the precipitated complex was counted. By this method, only rhIGFBP-5 and the 6-6-5 chimera formed ternary complexes using either IGF tracer (Fig. 4, A and B). No ternary complex formation was seen for the 5-5-6 chimera or for rhIGFBP-6 at the highest concentration tested (10 ng/0.3 ml). The 6-6-5 chimera was significantly less potent than rhIGFBP-5 using either tracer. To compare the ability of the IGFBPs to compete for ALS binding in the absence and presence of excess unlabeled IGFs, a tracer of iodinated IGF-I covalently cross-linked to IGFBP-5 was added to a fixed amount of ALS and increasing IGFBP concentrations from 1 to 250 ng, with excess IGF-I or IGF-II (100 ng) in some tubes (Fig. 4, C–E). These results show that the 6-6-5 chimera competed for ternary complex formation more effectively in the presence of IGF-I than IGF-II (Table II). This is in contrast to the binary complex studies, in which 6-6-5 showed a clear preference for binding to IGF-II rather than IGF-I. The 6-6-5 chimera in this competitive assay had 40% of the potency of rhIGFBP-5. This relatively high activity is likely to be due to the presence of excess IGFs in this format, in contrast to the positive complex formation assay (Fig. 4,A and B), in which the tracer IGF concentration is limiting.Table IISummary of competition binding assays by IGFBPs (in the presence of IGF-I or IGF-II) with 125I-IGF-I-IGFBP-5 cross-linked tracer binding to ALS, as shown in Fig. 4EC50+IGF-I+IGF-IINo IGFng/mlrhIGFBP-585.7 ± 3.6229 ± 9.222676–6-5217 ± 9.8571 ± 191224The effective concentrations (EC50), in ng/ml (mean ± S.D.), of rhIGFBP-5 or the 6–6-5 chimera that caused half-maximal displacement of radiolabeled tracer in the presence of IGF-I or IGF-II or no added IGF are shown.

Calculations were derived from three independent experiments, except for the IGFBPs in the absence of added IGFs, for which an average result from two independent experiments is shown. Open table in a new tab The effective concentrations (EC50), in ng/ml (mean ± S.D.), of rhIGFBP-5 or the 6–6-5 chimera that caused half-maximal displacement of radiolabeled tracer in the presence of IGF-I or IGF-II or no added IGF are shown. The 5–5-6 chimera and rhIGFBP-6 did not demonstrate any competition over the dose range studied. Calculations were derived from three independent experiments, except for the IGFBPs in the absence of added IGFs, for which an average result from two independent experiments is shown. In the absence of added IGFs (Fig. 4 E), though at much higher concentrations than in the presence of IGFs, rhIGFBP-5 and the 6-6-5 chimera were able to compete with the cross-linked tracer for binding to ALS. In the absence of IGFs, the 6-6-5 chimera was more potent than rhIGFBP-5, in contrast to the greater activity of IGFBP-5 when IGFs were present. The concentrations of these IGFBPs required for 50% inhibition of cross-linked tracer binding to ALS are shown in Table II. Using this format neither rhIGFBP-6 nor the 5-5-6 chimera had any effect on IGFBP-5 ternary complex formation in the presence or absence of IGFs. A second method of assessing ternary complex formation demonstrated equivalent results to those seen by the immunoprecipitation method. By fast protein liquid chromatography on a column of Superose-12 (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech), of the two chimeras, only 6-6-5 could form ternary complexes (Fig. 5, A and C), as was also seen for IGFBP-5 (Fig. 5, B and D). In the presence of ALS, the 5-5-6 chimera formed binary complexes only with each of the IGF tracers (Fig. 5, A and C). A similar result was seen (Fig. 5, B and D) for IGFBP-6, as was reported previously (5Kiefer M.C. Ioh R.S. Bauer D.M. Zapf J. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1991; 176: 219-225Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). The broad-peaked distribution of the IGF tracer across fractions, which is seen particularly in the presence of the 6-6-5 chimera, may indicate some dissociation of previously formed complexes during fast protein liquid chromatography and a dynamic equilibrium between ternary complexes, binary complexes, and free IGF tracer. Such dissociation is well recognized in complex formation studies using fast protein liquid chromatography (19Winzor D.J. J. Chromatogr. 1992; 597: 67-82Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). Because GAGs bind IGFBP-5 in its basic carboxyl-terminal domain (10Arai T. Parker A. Busby Jr., W. Clemmons D.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 20388-20393Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 11Booth B.A. Boes M. Andress D.L. Dake B.L. Kiefer M.C. Maack C. Linhardt R.J. Bar K. Caldwell E.E.O. Weiler J. Bar R.S. Growth Regul. 1995; 5: 1-17PubMed Google Scholar), they were used in the ALS immunoprecipitation format to determine whether they affected IGFBP-5 binding to ALS. Binding of IGFBP-5 to ALS in the presence of excess IGF-I was markedly inhibited by the addition of heparin sulfate (25 μg/ml). The effect on 6-6-5 binding to ALS was even greater with binding entirely abolished by 25 μg/ml heparin sulfate (Fig. 6 A). Similar results were seen in the presence of IGF-II (not shown). Because GAGs are reported to inhibit IGFBP-5 binding to IGFs (10Arai T. Parker A. Busby Jr., W. Clemmons D.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 20388-20393Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 20Arai T. Clarke J. Parker A. Busby Jr., W. Nam T. Clemmons D.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 6099-6106Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar), the alternative assay format using IGF-I-IGFBP-5 cross-linked tracer and ALS was used to determine whether IGFBP-5 binary complex binding to ALS was inhibited by these substances. Even under conditions where IGF-I could not be displaced from IGFBP-5, increasing concentrations of heparan sulfate and heparin inhibited IGFBP-5 ternary complex formation (Fig. 6 B), whereas under the study conditions, dermatan sulfate and chondroitin sulfate A did not (not shown). In comparison with IGFBP-3 ternary complex formation using an equivalent assay format, these GAGs inhibited IGFBP-5 ternary complex more potently. Because GAGs are known to bind to the basic carboxyl-terminal region of IGFBP-5, these results are consistent with the involvement of this region in ALS binding. Increasing amounts of a synthetic fragment representing the basic sequence IGFBP-5(201–218) (designated Peptide 5) were added in a competitive immunoprecipitation assay using IGF-I-IGFBP-5 cross-linked tracer and ALS (Fig. 7 A). This peptide inhibited IGFBP-5 ternary complex formation in a dose-dependent manner. A synthetic basic region IGFBP-3 peptide (215–232), designated Peptide 3, inhibited IGFBP-5 ternary complex with potency equivalent to that of Peptide 5. A nonsense peptide (designated Peptide ns5), with the same amino acid content of Peptide 5 but with a random amino acid sequence, inhibited cross-linked tracer binding to ALS to the same extent as Peptide 5 and Peptide 3. The synthetic peptide generated from the equivalent IGFBP-6 carboxyl-terminal region IGFBP-6(168–185) (designated Peptide 6) also inhibited complex formation, albeit less potently than the other synthetic peptides. Similar results were seen in the presence of 100 ng/tube IGF-I (not shown). Taken together, these synthetic peptide results suggest that charge is important for ALS binding, at least for these short synthetic peptides. The results are not specific to the amino acid sequence in the carboxyl-terminal IGFBP-5 basic region, as Peptide ns5 showed inhibition equivalent to that seen for Peptide 5. In contrast to the equipotent effect of synthetic Peptides 3 and 5 in inhibiting cross-linked tracer binding to ALS, differences were found for the native IGFBPs. Whereas full- length rhIGFBP-5, at high concentrations, did compete for cross-linked tracer binding to ALS in the absence of IGFs (Fig. 7 B and Table II), full-length IGFBP-3 (to 1 μg/tube) showed no competition in the absence of IGFs, confirming our previous observations (14Baxter R.C. Martin J.L. Beniac V.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 11843-11848Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). This result suggests that IGFBP-5 binds weakly to ALS in the absence of IGFs. IGF-I and IGF-II are carried in serum predominantly in a growth hormone-dependent ternary complex (21Furlanetto R.W. J. Clin. Endocrinol.

We have recently shown that similar complexes can form with IGFBP-5 instead of IGFBP-3 (7Twigg S.M. Baxter R.C. J. Biol.

The ternary complexes appear to function as a circulating reservoir of IGFs and limit the rate of efflux of IGFs to tissues, predominantly due to t"
https://openalex.org/W2040708509,"The rat GLYT-1 gene encodes two glycine transporter variants, GLYT-1a and GLYT-1b, that differ in NH2 termini and 5′-noncoding regions as well as in tissue distribution. The GLYT-1 gene contains 15 exons, with the first two specific for GLYT-1a and the third specific for GLYT-1b. By combining RNase protection and rapid amplification of cDNA ends analysis, we have determined transcription start sites for GLYT-1a and GLYT-1b. By using a functional luciferase reporter assay, we demonstrate that distinct promoters regulate the expression of these transporters in several cell lines. Serially truncated GLYT-1b promoter constructs reveal a basal promoter within 304 base pairs of the transcription start site, possible negative regulatory elements between −304 and −1310, and additional positive regulatory elements between −1310 and −5264. The GLYT-1 gene contains three sets of dinucleotide repeats, two AC repeats, and one TG repeat which may form stem-loop structures to either facilitate or interfere with transcription of one of the transporter isoforms. The potential use of dinucleotide repeats in this manner would represent a novel mechanism for gene splicing. The use of distinct promoters for GLYT-1a and GLYT-1b suggests that these transporters have unique regulatory requirements that may reflect the differential tissue-specific expression patterns in white matter (GLYT-1b) and gray matter (GLYT-1a).

Glycine is the major inhibitory neurotransmitter in the brainstem and spinal cord and acts as a co-agonist at the ionotropic glutamate NMDA1 receptors throughout the central nervous system. A role for NMDA receptors, and therefore, glycine, has been implicated in numerous disease states including glutamate neurotoxicity associated with ischemia (1Lees K.R. Neurology. 1997; 49: S66-S69Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 2Small D.L. Buchan A.M. Int. Rev. Neurobiol. 1997; 40: 137-171Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and schizophrenia (3Coyle J.T. Harv. Rev. Psychiatry. 1996; 3: 241-253Crossref PubMed Scopus (485) Google Scholar, 4Hirsch S.R. Das I. Garey L.J. de Belleroche J. Pharmacol. Biochem. Behav. 1997; 56: 797-802Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). Several studies have suggested that partial glycine agonists may be effective in limiting damage due to glutamate excitotoxicity (5Fossom L.H. Skolnick P. J. Neural. Transm. 1997; 49 (suppl.): 235-244Google Scholar). The primary means of regulating extracellular levels of glycine is by re-uptake through high affinity glycine transporters. Recent evidence demonstrates that glycine transporter activity can modulate NMDA receptor activity when both are co-expressed in Xenopus oocytes (6Supplisson S. Bergman C. J. Neurosci. 1997; 17: 4580-4590Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and that, in the presence of low levels of glycine, peptides such as dynorphin can regulate NMDA receptors (7Zhang L. Peoples R.W. Oz M. Harvey-White J. Weight F.F. Brauneis U. J. Neurophysiol. 1997; 78: 582-590Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). In addition to removing glycine from the extracellular space, Ca2+-independent glycine release may occur through reversal of the transporter (8Attwell D. Mobbs P. Curr. Opin. Neurobiol. 1994; 4: 353-359Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar, 9Attwell D. Barbour B. Szatkowski M. Neuron. 1993; 11: 401-407Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (726) Google Scholar). In light of these data, regulation of glycine transporter activity may represent an important therapeutic avenue by which to alter extracellular glycine levels. Neurotransmitter transporters are membrane-bound proteins that actively transport released neurotransmitters back into presynaptic neurons and surrounding glia, thereby terminating the activity of monoamine and amino acid neurotransmitters, and helping replenish presynaptic pools of neurotransmitters. On the basis of sequence homology, ion dependence, and predicted topology, transporters have been classified into several families (10Amara S.G. Kuhar M.J. Annu. Rev. Neurosci. 1993; 17: 73-93Crossref Scopus (1001) Google Scholar, 11Borowsky B. Hoffman B.J. Int. Rev. Neurobiol. 1995; 38: 139-199Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar). Included in the largest of these, the Na+/Cl−-dependent family, are transporters for the monoamine neurotransmitters dopamine, norepinephrine, and serotonin, as well as amino acid neurotransmitters γ-aminobutyric acid, glycine, proline, taurine, and betaine. Whereas a single transporter has been identified for each of the monoamine neurotransmitters, multiple subtypes have been reported for the amino acid neurotransmitters γ-aminobutyric acid and glycine. Two glycine transporter genes, GLYT-1 and GLYT-2, have been identified. The rat GLYT-1 gene encodes two glycine transporter variants (12Borowsky B. Mezey E. Hoffman B.J. Neuron. 1993; 10: 851-863Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (192) Google Scholar), GLYT-1a (12Borowsky B. Mezey E. Hoffman B.J. Neuron. 1993; 10: 851-863Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (192) Google Scholar, 13Guastella J. Brecha N. Weigmann C. Lester H.A. Davidson N. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 7189-7193Crossref PubMed Scopus (239) Google Scholar) and GLYT-1b (14Smith K.E. Borden L.A. Hartig P.R. Branchek T. Weinshank R.L. Neuron. 1992; 8: 927-935Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (383) Google Scholar). These two isoforms are identical except for the NH2termini and 5′-noncoding regions. The only differences in the amino acid sequences of these two transporters are the first 10 for GLYT-1a (Met-Val-Gly-Lys-Gly-Ala-Lys-Gly-Met-Leu) and the first 15 for GLYT-1b (Met-Ala-Val-Ala-His-Gly-Pro-Val-Ala-Thr-Ser-Ser-Pro-Glu-Gln). GLYT-1a and GLYT-1b variants have also been identified in the mouse (15Liu Q.R. Nelson H. Mandiyan S. Lopez-Corcuera B. Nelson N. FEBS Lett. 1992; 305: 110-114Crossref PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar, 16Adams R.H. Sato K. Shimada S. Tohyama M. Puschel A.W. Betz H. J. Neurosci. 1995; 15: 2524-2532Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Furthermore, human GLYT-1a, GLYT-1b, and GLYT-1c isoforms have been isolated (27Kim K.M. Kingsmore S.F. Han H. Yang-Feng T.L. Godinot N. Seldin M.F. Caron M.G. Giros B. Mol. Pharmacol. 1994; 45: 608-617PubMed Google Scholar). In addition to glycine transporters encoded byGLYT-1, a rat GLYT-2 glycine transporter has been cloned (17Liu Q.R. Lopez-Corcuera B. Nelson H. Mandiyan S. Nelson N. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 12145-12149Crossref PubMed Scopus (247) Google Scholar) and localized to the hindbrain and spinal cord in glycinergic neurons (18Luque J.M. Nelson N. Richards J.G. Neuroscience. 1995; 64: 525-535Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar, 19Jursky F. Nelson N. J. Neurochem. 1995; 64: 1026-1033Crossref PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar) with a distribution distinct from both GLYT-1a and GLYT-1b (20Zafra F. Gomeza J. Olivares L. Aragon C. Gimenez C. Eur. J. Neurosci. 1995; 7: 1342-1352Crossref PubMed Scopus (241) Google Scholar, 21Zafra F. Aragon C. Olivares L. Danbolt N.C. Gimenez C. Storm-Mathisen J. J. Neurosci. 1995; 15: 3952-3969Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). We have previously demonstrated by both in situhybridization histochemistry and Northern analysis that GLYT-1a and GLYT-1b have distinct distributions in the rat. Whereas GLYT-1a mRNA is found in gray matter in the central nervous system as well as a number of peripheral tissues, GLYT-1b mRNA was detected only in white matter in the central nervous system (12Borowsky B. Mezey E. Hoffman B.J. Neuron. 1993; 10: 851-863Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (192) Google Scholar). By using RNase protection assays, mRNA expression of these two isoforms is temporally distinct in the developing mouse embryo (16Adams R.H. Sato K. Shimada S. Tohyama M. Puschel A.W. Betz H. J. Neurosci. 1995; 15: 2524-2532Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Thus, these transporters appear to be alternatively spliced or alternatively promoted from a single gene, in a tissue-specific and developmentally specific manner. Based on the determination of multiple transcription start sites for both mouse GLYT-1a and GLYT-1b, it was suggested, but not demonstrated, that alternative promoter usage rather than alternative splicing mediates the production of these two isoforms (16Adams R.H. Sato K. Shimada S. Tohyama M. Puschel A.W. Betz H. J. Neurosci. 1995; 15: 2524-2532Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Although tissue culture models suggest similar pharmacologic profiles for these transporters, the limited number of pharmacologic tools for glycine transporters makes it difficult to definitively address this issue (13Guastella J. Brecha N. Weigmann C. Lester H.A. Davidson N. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 7189-7193Crossref PubMed Scopus (239) Google Scholar, 14Smith K.E. Borden L.A. Hartig P.R. Branchek T. Weinshank R.L. Neuron. 1992; 8: 927-935Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (383) Google Scholar). Whereas GLYT1 proteins have been identified by immunohistochemistry in the rat brain (20Zafra F. Gomeza J. Olivares L. Aragon C. Gimenez C. Eur. J. Neurosci. 1995; 7: 1342-1352Crossref PubMed Scopus (241) Google Scholar, 21Zafra F. Aragon C. Olivares L. Danbolt N.C. Gimenez C. Storm-Mathisen J. J. Neurosci. 1995; 15: 3952-3969Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), available antibodies do not distinguish between the two isoforms, GLYT-1a and GLYT-1b. The differences in the NH2 termini of these transporters may reflect differences in the ability of these transporters to interact with different cellular proteins and/or to target to different subcellular compartments. In addition, glycine transporters found in gray matter (GLYT-1a) and glycine transporters found in white matter (GLYT-1b) may have different physiologic roles with distinct regulatory requirements. In the present study, we have determined transcription start sites for the rat GLYT-1a and GLYT-1b transporters by combining RNase protection assays with rapid amplification of cDNA ends (RACE) analysis. Furthermore, by using functional reporter assays, we have identified distinct promoters that regulate the expression of GLYT-1a and GLYT-1b. Analysis of the genomic structure of the GLYT-1 gene suggests a novel mechanism for gene splicing. All probes and primers described in the text are illustrated in Fig. 1. Two overlapping clones from a Wistar rat genomic cosmid library (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA) that hybridized to a probe common to GLYT-1a and GLYT-1b were isolated (probe 1). One clone (RC-GLYT-1-1) hybridized to a probe specific for GLYT-1a (probe 3) and a probe specific for GLYT-1b (probe 4) but not to a common 3′ probe (probe 2). A second clone (RC-GLYT-1-2) hybridized only to the common 3′ probe. Probes were labeled with [α-32P]dCTP using a random priming kit (Boehringer Mannheim). Southern analysis was performed as described previously (12Borowsky B. Mezey E. Hoffman B.J. Neuron. 1993; 10: 851-863Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (192) Google Scholar). The nucleotide sequence was determined from overlapping fragments subcloned into pBluescript II (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA) by the dideoxynucleotide method using Sequenase polymerase (U. S. Biochemical Corp.), or directly from the cosmid clones using SequiTherm Cycle Sequencing polymerase (Epicentre, Madison, WI). Nucleotide sequences were assembled using the GCG Sequence Analysis Software Package (22Devereux J. Haeberli P. Smithies O. Nucleic Acids Res. 1984; 12: 387-395Crossref PubMed Scopus (11531) Google Scholar). The 5′ ends of GLYT-1 were amplified using a 5′-AmpliFINDER RACE kit (CLONTECH, Palo Alto, CA). Poly (A)+RNA (2 μg) from rat cerebellum or rat brainstem and a primer common to GLYT-1a and GLYT-1b (primer A or primer B) were annealed at 65 °C for 5 min. First strand cDNA was synthesized with avian myeloblastosis virus reverse transcriptase at 52 °C for 30 min. The RNA was then hydrolyzed with NaOH at 65 °C for 30 min, and excess primer and nucleotides were removed using a glass matrix support (GENO-BIND, NEN Life Science Products). A single-stranded AmpliFINDER anchor (CLONTECH, Palo Alto, CA) was ligated to the 3′ end of the cDNA overnight at room temperature using T4 RNA ligase. The anchored cDNA was amplified with Taq DNA polymerase (Boehringer Mannheim) using a primer complementary to the anchor (AmpliFINDER anchor primer) and either a GLYT-1a-specific primer (primer C), a GLYT-1b-specific primer (primer D), or a primer common to GLYT-1a and GLYT-1b (primer E). All PCR components except for primers were heated to 82 °C. Primers were then added followed by 35 cycles of amplification (94 °C for 45 s, 55 °C for 45 s, and 72 °C for 2 min) and a final 7-min extension at 72 °C. PCR products were blunt-ended with T4 polynucleotide kinase (New England Biolabs, Beverly, MA), and subcloned into pCR-Script SK(+) (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA). Clones were screened with32P-end-labeled oligonucleotide probes specific for GLYT-1a (probe 5) or GLYT-1b (probe 6). Positive clones were sequenced to determine transcription start sites. To make complementary RNA (cRNA) probes, GLYT-1a- and GLYT-1b-specific genomic fragments were PCR-amplified (using primers F and G for GLYT-1a, and primers D and H for GLYT-1b) and subcloned into pBluescript SK(+). The GLYT-1a-specific fragment was from −181 to −579, and the GLYT-1b-specific fragment was from +44 to −236, relative to their respective translation start sites (Fig. 2). To make the antisense cRNA probes for GLYT-1a (probe 7) and GLYT-1b (probe 8), plasmids (1 μg) were linearized with NotI and transcribed in vitro with T7 RNA polymerase and [α-32P]CTP, using a MAXIscript T7/T3 kit (Ambion, Austin, TX). Sense probes were transcribed with T3 RNA polymerase from EcoRI- digested GLYT-1a or Xho-digested GLYT-1b plasmids. Labeled probes were purified on 5% acrylamide, 8.4 m urea denaturing gels and eluted overnight at 37 °C. RNase protection assays were carried out using the RPA II kit (Ambion, Austin, TX). Sense and antisense cRNA probes (1 × 106 cpm) were hybridized overnight at 55 °C with either 8 μg of poly (A)+ RNA from total rat brain or 10 μg of yeast RNA and then digested with RNase A (0.5 units) and RNase T1 (20 units) for 30 min at 37 °C. Following ethanol precipitation, protected fragments were separated on a 6% acrylamide, 8.4 m urea denaturing gel. The sizes of protected fragments were determined by comparison to an adjacent dideoxynucleotide sequencing reaction. Luciferase (LUC) reporter plasmids were constructed by subcloning portions of theGLYT-1 gene into the polylinker site upstream from the firefly luciferase cDNA in pGL2-Basic (Promega, Madison, WI). pGLYT-1a-LUC contained a 2.9-kb NotI-SacII fragment that included the 5′-most region of the isolated cosmid and part of the first exon (−32683 to +210 relative to the GLYT-1a transcription start). pGLYT-1b-LUC contained a 5.4-kbBamHI-EarI fragment assembled from a 4.9-kbBamHI fragment and adjacent 0.5-kbBamHI-EarI fragment (−5264 to +130 relative to GLYT-1b transcription start). pGLYT-1b-LUC was digested withNheI, SacI, or KpnI and re-ligated to produce the following truncated constructs: pGLYT-1b-1310-LUC (−1310 to +130), pGLYT-1b-785-LUC (−785 to +130), and pGLYT-1b-304-LUC (−304 to +130), respectively. Constructs were verified by restriction mapping and sequencing of DNA junctions. The rat neuroblastoma cell B104, the rat glioma C6 glioma, and the rat oligodendrocyte type 2 astrocyte progenitor cell CG4 were plated at 2 × 105to 5 × 105 cells per well in 6-well tissue culture plates 1 day before transfection. Two days after plating at low density, CG4 cells were differentiated into oligodendrocytes or type 2 astrocytes (23Louis J.C. Magal E. Muir D. Manthorpe M. Varon S. J. Neurosci. Res. 1992; 31: 193-204Crossref PubMed Scopus (362) Google Scholar) and allowed to differentiate for 6 days prior to transfection. Reporter constructs (2 μg of DNA in 100 μl of DMEM) and LipofectAMINE reagent (Life Technologies, Inc.; 6 μg in 100 μl of DMEM) were mixed, incubated at room temperature for 45 min, and then added to cells along with 800 μl of DMEM. After 4–5 h, 1 ml of DMEM with 20% fetal bovine serum was added to each well, and cells were fed with complete growth medium 20 h later. Seventy-two hours after transfection, cells were washed twice with phosphate-buffered saline and lysed in 200 μl of lysis buffer (Promega, Madison, WI). Following a brief centrifugation to remove cell debris, triplicate 10-μl samples were used to determine luciferase activity (Berthold Lumat LB 9501). An additional 10-μl sample was reserved for protein determination (BCA kit, Pierce). All transfections were performed in triplicate 2–4 times. Transfection efficiencies for each cell line were determined by β-galactosidase staining following transfection with pCMV β-galactosidase. Briefly, cells were fixed for 5 min at 4 °C with a solution of 2% formaldehyde and 0.2% glutaraldehyde and then incubated overnight at 37 °C with 5-bromo-4-chloro-3-indolyl-β-galactopyranoside (1 mg/ml) in 5 mm potassium ferricyanide, 5 mm potassium ferrocyanide, 2 mm MgCl2. Transfection efficiencies were 40- 50% for all cells except oligodendrocyte-differentiated CG4 cells, which had less than 5% transfection efficiency. There are 15 exons in the rat GLYT-1 gene (Fig. 2). Fig. 2 A illustrates the gene structure of GLYT-1 and the mRNA structure of GLYT-1a and GLYT-1b. The intron-exon consensus splice sites and exon sizes are also shown (Fig. 2 B). The first two exons are specific for GLYT-1a; the third exon is specific for GLYT-1b, and the remaining 12 exons are common to both. Exon 1, which contains only noncoding sequences, was not detected in previously published cDNAs. RC-GLYT-1–1 contained 2.9 kb upstream (5′) from the first exon. Translation start sites for GLYT-1a and GLYT-1b are found in exons 2 and 3, respectively. Transcription initiation sites can be analyzed either by RNase protection analysis or by 5′-RACE. Prediction of transcription start sites based on analysis of RACE products alone can be misleading because of the potential for premature reverse transcription stops. Similarly, RNase protection analysis can be misleading because it does not reveal information about exon size or number. We integrated these two approaches to more reliably predict the transcription start sites for GLYT-1a and GLYT-1b. 5′-RACE analysis using a GLYT-1a-specific primer (primer C) revealed a GLYT-1a-specific exon approximately 8 kb upstream from the second GLYT-1a-specific exon. Of the 25 RACE products that hybridized to a GLYT-1a-specific probe (probe 5), 10 extended into the first exon. As indicated by the inner arrows on the left panelof Fig. 3, 6 of these predicted start sites clustered over a 10-base range, from 238 to 247 bases upstream from the translation start of GLYT-1a. Three products predicted start sites 20–52 bases downstream from this region. One RACE product predicted a transcription start site 358 bases upstream from the translation start (Fig. 3, left). Of the 24 RACE products that hybridized to a GLYT-1b-specific probe (probe 6), 11 were clustered over a 10-base region 98–107 bases upstream from the GLYT-1b translation start site (Fig. 3, right, inner arrows). Eight products were clustered over a 14-base region 65–78 bases upstream from the GLYT-1b translation start (Fig. 3, right). Four additional RACE products were 44, 51, 122, and 140 bases upstream from the GLYT-1b translation start site. RNase protection analysis on rat brain poly (A+) RNA using a cRNA probe containing part of exon 1 and its 5′-flanking region (probe 7) identified multiple transcription start sites for GLYT-1a over a 100-base region, with a major protected band in exon 1, 338 bases upstream from the GLYT-1a translation start site (Fig. 3,right, outer arrows). Several smaller, fainter protected bands suggest multiple start sites. The clustering of RACE products around the smallest protected band is most likely due to the failure of reverse transcriptase to complete transcription. None of these bands were protected when this probe was hybridized with yeast RNA or when the sense probe was hybridized with rat brain poly (A)+ RNA (data not shown). RNase protection analysis of rat brain poly (A+) RNA using probe 8, which contains part of exon 3 and its 5′-flanking region, predicted multiple transcription start sites for GLYT-1b (Fig. 3, right). This probe protected several bands over a 60-base range. The major protected band predicted a start site 107 bases upstream from the GLYT-1b translation start site and coincided with the major clustering of RACE products. Protected bands 76 and 68 bases from the translation start site coincided with other RACE products. None of these bands were protected when this probe was hybridized with yeast RNA or when the sense probe was hybridized with rat brain poly(A)+ RNA (data not shown). The sequence of the first 2 exons of GLYT-1a as well as part of the 5′-flanking region of GLYT-1a is shown in Fig. 4 A. The sequence is numbered with first potential transcription start site as 1. There are no apparent TATA or CCAAT boxes near the transcription start sites. Instead, as is typical for TATA-less promoters, there is a clustering of consensus sites for SP1 and one overlapping liver suppressor factor site located 13–28 bases upstream of the first predicted start site. In addition, there is a consensus site for AP-1 58 bases upstream from the first start site, and two consensus sites for a transcriptional initiator protein (24Javahery R. Khachi A. Lo K. Zenzie-Gregory B. Smale S.T. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 116-127Crossref PubMed Scopus (597) Google Scholar) 81 and 136 bases upstream from the first start site. Further 5′ to this region are 3 sites for SP1, and single sites for C/EBP, AP-3 and GRE. Also 5′ to the transcription start site is a 46-base pair dinucleotide repeat (see below). Fig. 4 B shows the first exon of GLYT-1b (exon 3) and 1 kb of its 5′-flanking region. The first potential transcription start site is numbered 1. As was the case for GLYT-1a, no clear TATA box is found near the transcription start sites. Unlike GLYT- 1a, there is no clustering of SP1 sites near the start site. Instead, there is a 54-base dinucleotide repeat 160 bases upstream from the first predicted start site (see below). Immediately upstream from this repeat are consensus sites for Z-DNA (25Nordheim A. Rich A. Nature. 1983; 303: 674-679Crossref PubMed Scopus (272) Google Scholar) and a consensus site for a transcriptional initiator protein. There is also a CRE binding site within the multiple start site region. Within the 6-kb intron between exon 2 and exon 3 there are numerous consensus sites for various transcription factors, some of which are illustrated in Fig. 7. Fig. 4 C illustrates the 5′ end of the GLYT-1 gene and highlights the promoter regions, the first potential transcription start sites, and the translation start sites for GLYT-1a and GLYT-1b. Although it has been demonstrated that GLYT-1a and GLYT-1b are encoded by a single gene, it remains to be determined whether they are alternatively spliced from a single promoter or the result of alternative promoter usage. To investigate this, we measured the promoter activities of the 5′-flanking regions of GLYT-1a and GLYT-1b by using a transient transfection system with luciferase as a reporter gene. The constructs used in these studies consisted of fragments of genomic DNA from the 5′-flanking regions of GLYT-1a or GLYT-1b inserted upstream of the gene encoding firefly luciferase in the vector pGL2-Basic (Promega) (Fig. 5,bottom). As shown in Fig. 5 (left bars), a 2.9-kb fragment from the 5′-flanking region of GLYT-1a, pGLYT-1a-LUC, had very strong promoter activity in all cells tested. A 5.4-kb fragment from the 5′-flanking region of GLYT-1b, pGLYT-1b-LUC, had significant promoter activity in differentiated CG4 cells but not in CG4 progenitors (Fig. 5,second bars from left). We recently determined by both RT-PCR and in situ hybridization that GLYT-1a is expressed in all three states of CG4 cells, whereas GLYT-1b is expressed only very weakly in the progenitor cells but more strongly in the differentiated cells. 2B. Borowsky and B. J. Hoffman, unpublished observations.Thus, the 5′-flanking regions of both GLYT-1a and GLYT-1b have promoter activity in cells expressing these transporters. These results demonstrate that GLYT-1a and GLYT-1b arise by alternative promoter usage rather than alternative splicing from a common promoter. We also tested the promoter activities of the 5′-flanking regions of GLYT-1a and GLYT-1b in the rat glioma cell line C6 glioma and the rat neuroblastoma cell line B104 (Fig. 5, top). We have demonstrated by RT-PCR that both of these cell lines express GLYT-1a but not GLYT-1b.2 In both cell lines, the 5′-flanking region of GLYT-1a had very strong promoter activity. Surprisingly, the 5′-flanking region of GLYT-1b had weak, yet significant, promoter activity in these cells. One possible explanation for this is that these cell lines express low levels of GLYT-1b that were not detected by RT-PCR. Alternatively, the 5′-flanking region of GLYT-1b may have a basal promoter activity that would normally be inhibited in cells not expressing the transporter. As a first attempt at exploring this possibility, we generated serially truncated reporter constructs containing only the 3′-most sequence of the GLYT-1b construct as follows: pGLYT-1b-1310-LUC, pGLYT-1b-785-LUC, and pGLYT-1b-304-LUC. In CG4 oligodendrocytes, CG4 astrocytes, C6 glioma cells, or B104 cells, the 304-base pair flanking region and the full 5264-base pair flanking region had the strongest promoter activities (Fig. 6). In contrast, the 785- and 1310-base pair flanking regions had significantly weaker promoter activities in these cells. These findings suggest that a functional promoter exists within the 434 bases closest to exon 3 and that negative regulatory elements exist within the 304 bases upstream from this region and perhaps also in the adjacent 525 bases further upstream. The recovery of promoter activity in the full-length construct could be accounted for by additional positive regulatory elements in the more 3′ sequences or by a disinhibition of the negative regulation. In all cell lines tested, the promoter activity of the GLYT-1b construct was weaker than that of the GLYT-1a construct. It should be noted, however, that the promoter activities of both of these constructs were quite high. In C6 glioma cells, for example, the activities of the GLYT-1a and GLYT-1b promoters were 343,184 and 81,603 light units/μg of protein, respectively, whereas the SV40 control promoter was 239 light units/μg of protein (Fig. 5). In the present study, we have isolated and characterized the gene encoding two rat glycine transporter variants, GLYT-1a and GLYT-1b. We have used two strategies to determine the transcription start sites for these transporters and employed a functional reporter assay to determine regions of the gene important in regulating transcription. Our results demonstrate, for the first time, that transcription of these transporter variants is mediated by alternative promoter usage rather than alternative splicing off of a single promoter. In addition, our findings suggest several novel mechanisms that may potentially be important in regulating the alternative expression of these two transporters. The gene encoding the neurotransmitter transporters GLYT-1a and GLYT-1b consists of 15 exons. The first two exons are specific for GLYT-1a, the third specific for GLYT-1b, and the remaining exons are common to both transporters. The genomic organization of the rat GLYT-1 gene is similar to those of both the g-aminobutyric acid transporter GAT1(26Liu Q.R. Mandiyan S. Nelson H. Nelson N. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 6639-6643Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar) and the mouse Glyt-1 gene (16Adams R.H. Sato K. Shimada S. Tohyama M. Puschel A.W. Betz H. J. Neurosci. 1995; 15: 2524-2532Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The major apparent difference between the genomic organization of the ratGLYT-1 gene reported here and that of the mouse homologue reported previously (16Adams R.H. Sato K. Shimada S. Tohyama M. Puschel A.W. Betz H. J. Neurosci. 1995; 15: 2524-2532Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) is that we have found no evidence for a GLYT-1c-specific exon. Kim and colleagues (27Kim K.M. Kingsmore S.F. Han H. Yang-Feng T.L. Godinot N. Seldin M.F. Caron M.G. Giros B. Mol. Pharmacol. 1994; 45: 608-617PubMed Google Scholar) reported the isolation of a human GLYT-1c isoform consisting of the third exon, normally found in GLYT-1b, and an additional exon found between the third exon and the first common exon. Although we have found a region in the ratGLYT-1 gene that is homologous to this exon, we have not seen evidence that it is retained in mature mRNA. None of the RACE products that we obtained, using primers from the common region, contained this exon. Furthermore, Northern analysis, using an oligonucleotide probe complementary to this region, failed to detect any signal from rat brain or peripheral tissues (data not shown). It should be noted that, whereas Adams et al. (16Adams R.H. Sato K. Shimada S. Tohyama M. Puschel A.W. Betz H. J. Neurosci. 1995; 15: 2524-2532Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) include a GLYT-1c exon in their description of the GLYT-1 gene, they too have failed to detect any RACE clones containing this exon. Therefore, it appears that the only evidence for a GLYT-1c isoform is in human substantia nigra RNA (27Kim K.M. Kingsmore S.F. Han H. Yang-Feng T.L. Godinot N. Seldin M.F. Caron M.G. Giros B. Mol. Pharmacol. 1994; 45: 608-617PubMed Google Scholar). Combining RNase protection with RACE analysis, we demonstrate multiple transcription start sites for both GLYT-1a and GLYT-1b. The heterogeneity of transcription starts may be explained by the absence of TATA and CCAAT boxes for these genes. While potential start sites have been reported for the mouse GLYT-1 transporter, these were based only on RACE analysis (16Adams R.H. Sato K. Shimada S. Tohyama M. Puschel A.W. Betz H. J. Neurosci. 1995; 15: 2524-2532Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Because this type of analysis relies on reverse transcriptase, there is always the potential that premature transcription termination will lead to identification of false start sites. In the present study, we found a clustering of RACE products for GLYT-1a that were about 100 bases downstream from the major protected band, clearly illustrating the necessity for using multiple approaches. GLYT-1a is localized in gray matter within the central nervous system, as well as in macrophages in a number of peripheral tissues (12Borowsky B. Mezey E. Hoffman B.J. Neuron. 1993; 10: 851-863Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (192) Google Scholar). In contrast, GLYT-1b is found only in fiber tracts in the central nervous system (28Woolsey T.A. Van der Loos H. Brain Res. 1970; 17: 205-242Crossref PubMed Scopus (1850) Google Scholar). These differences make it likely that GLYT-1a and GLYT-1b have distinct regulatory requirements. Based on the sequences of GLYT-1a and GLYT-1b, we had previously suggested that the expression of these transporters was the result of either alternative splicing from a single promoter or alternative promoter usage (12Borowsky B. Mezey E. Hoffman B.J. Neuron. 1993; 10: 851-863Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (192) Google Scholar). Several lines of evidence suggest the latter. First, if alternative splicing alone mediates the expression of GLYT-1a and GLYT-1b, then there would have to be a common first exon to which the third exon could splice to generate GLYT-1b. In addition, the presence of multiple start sites for exon 3 suggests that it is a site of transcription initiation rather than simply an internal exon. Finally, evidence for alternative promoter usage comes from the functional reporter assays described in this study. We have demonstrated that the 5′-flanking regions of both GLYT-1a and GLYT-1b have strong promoter activity in transfected cells. Interestingly, although GLYT-1a and GLYT-1b have strong promoters, the levels of expression of these mRNAs in tissues are low, perhaps due to the presence of an endogenous inhibitor or to the instability of the mRNAs. By transiently transfecting cells with a portion of the 5′-flanking region of GLYT-1a linked to a luciferase reporter gene, we have demonstrated very strong promoter activity in the region from +210 to −2683 (relative to the first transcription start for GLYT-1a). Within this region, the only canonical sites for a TATA box are 878 and 1103 bases upstream from the first predicted transcription start site. There are a clustering of SP1 sites and an overlapping liver suppressor factor site (29Kim C.H. Heath C. Bertuch A. Hansen U. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1987; 84: 6025-6029Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar) 13–28 bases upstream from the first start site. Such a clustering is typical for TATA-less promoters (30Azizkhan J.C. Jensen D.E. Pierce A.J. Wade M. Crit. Rev. Eukaryotic Gene Expr. 1993; 3: 229-254PubMed Google Scholar). There are also two consensus sites for a transcriptional initiator protein ((C/T)(C/T)A(T/A)(C/T)(C/T)) located 81 and 136 bases upstream from the start sites. Whereas these have been shown to be sufficient for determining start sites in TATA-less promoters, the first A is usually located between −5 and +5 of the start site (24Javahery R. Khachi A. Lo K. Zenzie-Gregory B. Smale S.T. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 116-127Crossref PubMed Scopus (597) Google Scholar). Transient transfection of a luciferase reporter gene containing serially truncated portions of exon 3 and the upstream intron revealed basal promoter activity in a 434-base pair region including 304 bases upstream and 130 bases downstream from the first potential transcription start site. This finding indicates that GLYT-1b is regulated by a separate promoter from GLYT-1a. There is neither a clear TATA box nor a clustering of SP1 sites in the 5′-flanking region of GLYT-1b. However, the results of the present reporter studies have helped to define the regions of 5′ sequence that may be important in regulating the transcription of GLYT-1b. Fig. 7 shows the consensus sites for representative transcription factors and other potentially interesting structures located 5′ to exon 3 and also illustrates the boundaries of the reporter constructs used in this study. The only recognizable sites within pGLYT-1b-304-LUC are for a transcription initiation protein, a Z-DNA, and a 54-base dinucleotide repeat. These sites are located 159–232 bases upstream from the first predicted start site, with the first two being adjacent to one another and the dinucleotide repeat beginning 5 bases downstream. The strong promoter activity seen with this construct suggests that these three elements or a portion of them may be sufficient for basal promoter activation of GLYT-1b. It is possible that secondary structures formed by the Z-DNA, which can cause negative supercoiling (25Nordheim A. Rich A. Nature. 1983; 303: 674-679Crossref PubMed Scopus (272) Google Scholar), and the TG repeat could affect transcription. Of course, it remains possible that other yet to be described transcription factors are also involved. Our results further suggest that there are negative regulatory elements within pGLYT-1b-785-LUC and pGLYT-1b-1310-LUC and either additional positive regulatory elements or disinhibiting factors within pGLYT-1b-LUC. One of the most interesting features of the GLYT-1 gene is the presence of several sets of dinucleotide repeats. As shown in Fig. 8 A, there are 23 pairs of ACs 5′ of exon 1, 27 pairs of TGs 5′ of exon 3, and 2 sets of AC repeats, 17 and 21 pairs, 3′ of exon 3. Several possible scenarios in which secondary structures formed by these repeats might enable or disable the transcription of GLYT-1a or GLYT-1b are illustrated in Fig. 8. Although a definitive role for these repeats has yet to be demonstrated, it is tempting to speculate that they may result in secondary structures that could help to determine which isoform might be transcribed. While a role for these repeats in splicing or promotor choice has not been demonstrated, a role for secondary structures has been demonstrated. Secondary structure can influence alternative splicing as has been suggested for α-tropomyosin (31Libri D. Piseri A. Fiszman M.Y. Science. 1991; 252: 1842-1845Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar, 32Libri D. Goux-Pelletan M. Brody E. Fiszman M.Y. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1990; 10: 5036-5046Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 33Libri D. Mouly V. Lemonnier M. Fiszman M.Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 3471-3473Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and may preclude the recognition of one exon over another (34Bernstein S.I. Hodges D. Harford J.B. Morris D.R. mRNA Metabolism and Post-transcriptional Gene Regulation. Wiley-Liss, Inc., New York1997: 43-60Google Scholar). For example, a stem loop formed between the first AC repeat and the TG repeat could ensure the exclusion of exons 1 and 2 from GLYT-1b (Fig. 8 B). Similarly, a stem-loop formation between the TG repeat and one (Fig. 8 C) or both (Fig. 8 D) of the 3′ AC repeats could help ensure the exclusion of exon 3 from GLYT-1a. In addition to bringing exons to be spliced closer together physically, the secondary structure formed by these stem loops might also result in transcriptional interference of one or the other transporter. Although the exact roles of these dinucleotide repeats remain to be demonstrated, those proposed here represent a novel and intriguing mechanism for gene splicing. The present demonstration that GLYT-1a and GLYT-1b are transcribed from the same gene by different promoters suggests that it is critical for cells to be able to differentially regulate the levels of these transporters. The most likely rationale for this requirement is the ability to modulate the levels of these transporters in different regions or at different times during development. In support of this, we have previously demonstrated that GLYT-1a and GLYT-1b have quite distinct distributions in the rat, with the former present in gray matter in the central nervous system as well as several peripheral tissues, and the latter detected only in white matter in the central nervous system (12Borowsky B. Mezey E. Hoffman B.J. Neuron. 1993; 10: 851-863Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (192) Google Scholar). The limited number of pharmacologic tools available to assess glycine transporters makes it difficult to compare these transporters functionally, but it is likely that the demands on and requirements for a transporter in white matter are unique from those of a transporter in gray matter. We have recently demonstrated that progenitor oligodendrocyte type 2 astrocyte cells express high levels of GLYT-1a but very low levels of GLYT-1b, whereas mature oligodendrocytes derived from these cells express high levels of both transporter variants.2 Other potential differences between these transporters include targeting to different subcellular compartments and differential post-translational regulation by a casein kinase II phosphorylation site found only in GLYT-1b.

Lineage commitment of eukaryotic cells involves a highly controlled developmental progression through successive stages of differentiation. Hematopoiesis, the process of blood cell formation, provides a powerful experimental system for studying this process. During blood cell formation, pluripotent hematopoietic stem cells give rise to a hierarchy of distinct progenitors that differentiate into at least eight phenotypically different mature blood cell lineages (1Orkin S.H. Curr. Opin. Cell. Biol. 1995; 7: 870-877Crossref PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar). Since lineage commitment and differentiation involve alterations in patterns of gene expression, the function and regulation of tissue-restricted transcription factors represents a major issue (2Bockamp E.-O. McLaughlin F. Murrell A. Green A.R. BioEssays. 1994; 16: 481-488Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar, 3Orkin S.H. J. Biol.

For this reason, we have chosen to study the transcriptional regulation of the SCL gene (also known as tal-1), which encodes a lineage-restricted basic helix-loop-helix transcription factor pivotal for the regulation of hematopoiesis (5Green A.R. Nature. 1996; 383: 575-577Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar). SCL was originally discovered by virtue of a chromosomal translocation associated with T cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (6Begley C.G. Aplan P.D. Davey M.P. Nakahara K. Tchorz K. Kurtzberg J.

Rearrangements of the SCL locus are now realized to be the commonest molecular pathology associated with T cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (10Bash R.O. Hall S. Timmons C.F. Crist W.M. Amylon M. Smith R.G. Baer R. Blood. 1995; 86: 666-676Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). SCL expression is restricted to hematopoietic tissues, endothelial cells, and distinct regions in the brain (11Cross M.A. Heyworth C.M. Murrell A.M. Bockamp E.-O. Cobley U.T. Dexter T.M. Green A.R.

Within blood cells, SCL expression is exclusively found in committed erythroid, mast, and megakaryocytic cells as well as in interleukin-3-dependent progenitor and primitive CD34-positive cell lines (11Cross M.A. Heyworth C.M.

In cell lines, induction of erythroid differentiation resulted in up-regulation of SCL mRNA, although protein levels decreased (12Green A.R. Lints T. Visvader J. Harvey R. Begley C.G. Oncogene. 1992; 7: 653-660PubMed Google Scholar, 20Murrell A.M. Bockamp E.-O. Göttgens B. Chan Y.S. Goss M.A. Heyworth C.M. Green A.R. Oncogene. 1995; 11: 131-139PubMed Google Scholar), whereas induced granulocyte/monocyte differentiation was accompanied by extinction of SCL expression (11Cross M.A. Heyworth C.M. Murrell A.M. Bockamp E.-O. Cobley U.T. Dexter T.M. Green A.R. Oncogene. 1994; 9: 3013-3016PubMed Google Scholar). Indeed, down-regulation of SCL may be necessary for normal monocytic differentiation (21Tanigawa T. Elwood N. Metcalf D. Cary D. DeLuca E. Nicola N.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 7864-7868Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). Gene targeting experiments have demonstrated that SCL is required for the development of all hematopoietic lineages in mice, thus suggesting a crucial role for SCL in early blood cell development (22Robb L. Lyons I. Li R. Hartley L. Kontgen F. Harvey R.P. Metcalf D. Begley C.G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 7075-7079Crossref PubMed Scopus (483) Google Scholar, 23Shivdasani R.A. Mayer E.L. Orkin S.H. Nature. 1995; 373: 432-434Crossref PubMed Scopus (778) Google Scholar). In addition, SCL null ES cells failed to give rise to any colony-forming cells in vitro and did not contribute to hematopoietic tissues in general when used in chimeric mice (24Robb L. Elwood N.J. Elefanty A.G. Köntgen F. Li R. Barnett L.D. Begley C.G. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 4123-4129Crossref PubMed Scopus (285) Google Scholar, 25Porcher C. Swat W. Rockwell K. Fujiwara Y. Alt F.W. Orkin S.H. Cell. 1996; 86: 47-57Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (611) Google Scholar). Antisense and overexpression approaches have implied that SCL performs different functions in distinct hematopoietic cell types. The expression of antisense SCLconstructs in a multipotent cell line resulted in reduced proliferation and self-renewal (26Green A.R. De Luca E. Begley C.G. EMBO J. 1991; 10: 4153-4158Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar), whereas similar experiments inhibited erythroid differentiation of a committed erythroid cell line (27Aplan P.D. Nakahara K. Orkin S.H. Kirsch I.R. EMBO J. 1992; 11: 4073-4081Crossref PubMed Scopus (202) Google Scholar). Furthermore, experiments involving constitutive expression of normal, mutant, or truncated SCL polypeptides in myeloid progenitor cell lines suggested that SCL regulates proliferation, differentiation, and apoptosis (28Condorelli G.L. Tocci A. Botta R. Facchiano F. Testa U. Vitelli L. Valtieri M. Croce C.M. Peschle C. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 2954-2969Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). Inhibition of apoptosis may also underlie the leukemogenic effect of SCL expression in T cells (29Leroy-Viard K. Vinit M.-A. Lecointe N. Jouault H. Hibner U. Romeo P.-H. Mathieu-Mahul D. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 2341-2349Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). However, despite implicit involvement in several physiological processes, no target genes for SCL have yet been identified. The complex pattern of SCL expression raises important questions about the molecular mechanisms responsible for the cell-specific expression of SCL in hematopoietic stem cells and in a subset of committed hematopoietic cell types. We have therefore chosen to study the regulation of the murine SCLgenomic locus. Two proximal promoters have been identified in alternate exons (30Begley C.G. Robb L. Rockman S. Visvader J. Bockamp E.-O. Chan Y.S. Green A.R. Gene (Amst.). 1994; 138: 93-99Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar), and several distant enhancers and silencers have also been characterized (31Göttgens B.

Promoter 1a was regulated by GATA-1 in erythroid cells but was silent in myeloid cells lacking GATA-1. By contrast, promoter 1b was active in transient transfection assays only in primitive myeloid cells (32Bockamp E.-O. McLaughlin F. Murrell A.M. Göttgens B. Robb L. Begley C.G. Green A.R.

In this paper, we have characterized the molecular mechanisms regulating the SCL promoter region in mast cells. Our results show that promoter 1a was regulated by GATA-1, Sp1, and Sp3, similar to its regulation in erythroid cells. However, promoter 1b was strongly active in mast cells, in marked contrast to the situation in erythroid cells, and was regulated by PU.1 and Elf-1 in addition to Sp1 and Sp3. These results provide the first evidence thatSCL is a direct target for PU.1, Elf-1, and Sp3. The murine mast cell line 6− is a factor-independent subclone of Fmpl.6 and has been previously described (19Green A.R. Salvaris E. Begley C.G. Oncogene. 1991; 6: 475-479PubMed Google Scholar). The murine MST (96.42 B3) mast cell line and the murine J558 L plasma cell line have also been described previously (44Elefanty A.G. Cory S.

Elefanty, The Walter and Eliza Hall Institute of Medical Research, Melbourne, Australia), and J558 L (kindly provided by Dr. M. Neuberger, Laboratory of Molecular Biology, Cambridge, United Kingdom) were grown in RPMI 1640 plus 10% fetal calf serum. Drosophila SL2 Schneider cells have been described previously (46Schneider I. J. Embryol. Exp. Morphol. 1972; 27: 353-365PubMed Google Scholar) and were a generous gift from Dr. M. Freeman (Division of Cellular Biology, MRC-LMB, Cambridge, United Kingdom). SL2 Schneider cells were grown at 25 °C in Schneider medium supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum. After spinning the cells onto glass slides using a cytospin apparatus at 1000 rpm for 5 min, cells were air-dried and subsequently fixed for 3 h in Carmoy's solution (ethanol:chloroform:acetic acid, 6:3:1). After fixation, cells were washed in H2O, transferred for 5 min to 3% acetic acid, and stained with Alcian blue solution (1% Alcian blue (w/v) in 3% acetic acid). After the Alcian blue staining, cells were washed twice in 3% acetic acid and subsequently stained in safranin solution (1% safranin O (w/v) in 3% acetic acid) for exactly 1 min followed by three washes in H2O. All steps were performed at room temperature. SCL promoter sequences in all constructs are from a genomic clone isolated from a Balb/C genomic library (30Begley C.G. Robb L. Rockman S. Visvader J.

The following oligonucleotides were used as primers in the mutagenesis reaction (mutated residues are underlined, and the wild type binding consensus is shown in boldface type below the mutated residues).Sequences1–8 Mutants were generated on wild type SCLsingle-stranded templates, and all mutations were subsequently confirmed by nucleotide sequence analysis. Nuclear protein was prepared exactly as described previously (52O'Prey J. Ramsay S. Chambers I. Harrison P.R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 6290-6303Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). Footprinting probes were prepared by 5′-end labeling of DNA restriction fragments with T4 polynucleotide kinase and [γ-32P]ATP and isolated after secondary restriction (53Plumb M.A. Goodwin G.H. Walker J.M. Methods in Molecular Biology. 4. Humana Press, Clifton, NJ1988: 139-164Google Scholar). G + A markers were prepared by chemical sequencing reactions (54Maxam A.M. Gilbert W. Methods Enzymol. 1980; 65: 499-560Crossref PubMed Scopus (9008) Google Scholar). DNase I footprint protection assays were performed in a volume of 100 μl of storage buffer in the presence of 6 μg of poly(dI-dC), 2 ng of end-labeled restriction fragment, and up to 80 μl (30 μg) of nuclear protein extract. After partial DNase I digestion, the nucleic acid was purified and resolved by denaturing 6% polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and exposed for autoradiography. Transient transfections of MST, 6−, and J558 L cells were performed as described (32Bockamp E.-O. McLaughlin F. Murrell A.M. Göttgens B. Robb L. Begley C.G. Green A.R. Blood. 1995; 86: 1502-1514Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) with the difference that during the electropulse, voltages of 240 V (for MST and 6− cell lines) and of 220 V (for J558 L cell line) were applied. In the transfection experiments, 10 μg of pEF-BOS lacZ vector and 15 μg of the appropriate luciferase reporter construct were used. One day prior to transfection,Drosophila SL2 Schneider cells were seeded at 5 × 106 cells/10-cm plastic Petri dish. The next day, the medium was changed, and cells were transformed using the calcium phosphate method. Briefly, 5 μg of pPac expression plasmid or empty pPac vector were co-transfected with 7 μg of the +209 SCL1b pGL-2 luciferase reporter plasmid or a +209 SCL 1b mutant version. As an internal reference, 4 μg of the Sp1-independent p79blacZ plasmid was also co-transfected in each transformation. Cells were harvested 40 h post-transfection and assayed for luciferase and β-galactosidase activity. β-Galactosidase and luciferase assays for mammalian and invertebrate cell lines were carried out as described (32Bockamp E.-O. McLaughlin F. Murrell A.M. Göttgens B. Robb L. Begley C.G. Green A.R. Blood. 1995; 86: 1502-1514Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). A linear relationship between light units and amount of luciferase reporter plasmid was confirmed in all cell lines. For each pulse the relative light units were normalized for transfection efficiency against β-galactosidase values obtained from the same sample. The relative light unit values presented are the mean of at least four independent experiments, and the same pattern was also obtained using a different DNA preparation. Conditions for the band shift assays were as described (32Bockamp E.-O. McLaughlin F. Murrell A.M. Göttgens B. Robb L. Begley C.G. Green A.R.

Lineage-specific expression of the SCL gene has been studied in erythroid, early myeloid, and T cell lines (32Bockamp E.-O. McLaughlin F. Murrell A.M. Göttgens B. Robb L. Begley C.G. Green A.R. Blood. 1995; 86: 1502-1514Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 33Bockamp E.O. McLaughlin F. Göttgens B. Murrell A.M. Elefanty A.G. Green A.R. J. Biol.

Oncogene. 1994; 9: 2623-2632PubMed Google Scholar). However, nothing is known about the molecular mechanisms underlying lineage-restricted expression of SCL in mast cells. Since it is difficult to obtain sufficient numbers of homogeneous normal mast cells, we have chosen to study transcriptional regulation of both SCL promoters in the MST and 6− murine mast cell lines. Northern blot analysis revealed the expression of SCL mRNA in MST and 6− cells and also the presence of GATA-1- and GATA-2-specific transcripts (Fig. 1 A). In addition, mRNA for the Fcε receptor 1 α-chain receptor, which is known to be restricted to mast cells, basophils, and epidermal Langerhans cells (59Bieber T. Immunol. Today. 1994; 15: 52-53Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar), was detected in both cell lines. To further confirm the mast cell phenotype of MST and 6− cells, Alcian blue/safranin histochemical staining was performed (Fig. 1 B). More than 95% of the MST and 6− cells contained Alcian blue positive granules, characteristic of mast cells (60O'Farrell A.M. Ichihara M. Mui A.L.F. Miyajima A. Blood. 1996; 87: 3655-3668Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). No Alcian blue staining was detected in the J558 L plasma cell line. These results therefore demonstrated that the MST and 6− cell lines available in our laboratory displayed several mast cell-restricted characteristics.−37GATA5′­CGTGTGCGCCGCCGAAT¯TC¯AGATAAGGAGCCGCCTCGGG­3′A−69GATA5′­GGCCCGCCCGCCCCCAT¯TC¯CGATAAGCGCCTCGGCCATT­3′A−63Sp5′­CCGAGATAAGGAGCCCGCCTCGGG C C C GA A T T¯C C CGCCCGCCCGCCCCCGATAAGCGCCTCGGCC­3′C−101AP15′­GGCCATTATGGGCCAAAT G AA¯T T C¯ TT¯TTAATTTGGCAATTTC­3′ATGATTCAT+239Sp5′­AGTCTCCCCGG C T¯ G C¯ A GGGGCAGCGGAGGG­3′CGGGAGGGG+265ETS5′­GCGCAAGGGGAAAAGGGG G¯A G C T C¯ GGAAGAGAGTCTCCCC­3′GGGGAAGGAAG+277ETS5′­CTATTGCGCAAGGA¯G C T C¯AGGGGAAGGAAGG­3′GGGAAA+251MZF5′­GGAAGGAAGAGAGTG¯TC G A¯C GGCGGGAGGGCC­3′TCCCCGSEQUENCES 1–8 Luciferase reporter constructs were generated to determine SCL promoter usage in mast cells and to characterize mast cell-specific elements within SCLpromoters 1a and 1b. Transient transfection of a luciferase reporter construct, which contained approximately 2 kilobase pairs upstream of exon 1a into either 6− or MST mast cell lines, resulted in 10–30-fold stimulation when compared with values obtained using the empty luciferase vector (Fig. 2 A). Deletion of sequences upstream of position −187 (nucleotide numbering is relative to the transcriptional start site of exon 1a) did not decrease promoter 1a activity, but further deletion to −55 produced a marked fall in luciferase activity. By contrast, no transcriptional activation was detected when the same constructs were electroporated into the SCL-negative J558 L murine plasma cell line. These results demonstrate that promoter 1a could initiate transcription in mast cells and that a core promoter element spanning nucleotides −187 to +26 was sufficient for this activity. In order to study promoter 1b, a second series of deletion constructs were tested in 6− and MST cells. As shown in Fig. 2 B, constructs containing both exon 1a and exon 1b with approximately 2 kilobase pairs upstream sequence were between 25- and 45-fold more active than the empty expression vector. Removal of 5′ sequences including exon 1a and intronic sequence to position +209 did not reduce luciferase activity. The same constructs produced only weak luciferase activity in J558 L plasma cells. These results show that a region from +209 to +353 was sufficient for activity of promoter 1b in mast cells. Our data therefore demonstrated activity of both promoter 1a and promoter 1b in mast cell lines. The activity of both promoters was confirmed in splenic mast cells using an RNase protection assay to detect transcripts from both promoters (data not shown). To identify transcription factor binding sites important for promoter 1a and promoter 1b function, we analyzed both core promoter regions by DNase I footprinting in vitro. Using MST nuclear extracts and a labeled sense strand, three different protected areas were identified in promoter 1a (Fig. 3A). Footprint A corresponds to a region between nucleotides −74 and −56 upstream of the transcription start site of exon 1a and contains a GATA and an Sp1 binding motif. Footprint B is located between positions −40 and −26 and contains a second GATA binding site. Footprint C overlaps the first exon and the transcription start site. The same protected areas were also observed with a labeled antisense strand (data not shown). Within promoter 1b, two protected areas were detected using a labeled sense strand (Fig. 3 B). Footprint D between position +238 and +249, contains a MYC-associated zinc finger protein binding site that also resembles an Sp1 binding consensus (55Hagen G. Müller S. Beato M. Suske G.

Other bacteria employ either the ε-amino itself or incorporate other amino acids into the cross-bridge (13Schleifer K.H. Kandler O. Bacteriol. Rev. 1972; 36: 407-477Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Cross-linking, i.e., the transpeptidation reaction, is catalyzed by penicillin binding proteins and can be inhibited by β-lactam antibiotics (6Tipper D.J. Ghuysen J.-M. Strominger J.L.

Matsuhashi M. Tipper D.J. Fed. Proc. 1967; 26: 9-18PubMed Google Scholar). About 99% of wall peptides within the staphylococcal cell wall are cross-linked (12Tipper D.J. Berman M.F. Biochemistry. 1969; 8: 2183-2191Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). Covalent attachment of surface proteins to the staphylococcal cell wall also occurs by a transpeptidation mechanism, whereby the sorting signal is cleaved between the threonine (T) and the glycine (G) of the LPXTG motif upon export of the polypeptide from the bacterial cytoplasm (16Navarre W.W. Schneewind O. Mol. Microbiol. 1994; 14: 115-121Crossref PubMed Scopus (310) Google Scholar). The carboxyl of threonine is subsequently amide linked to the pentaglycyl cross-bridge of the staphylococcal cell wall (17Schneewind O. Fowler A. Faull K.F. Science. 1995; 268: 103-106Crossref PubMed Scopus (375) Google Scholar). Previous work investigated the anchor structure of surface proteins that were released from the cell wall of S. aureusby enzymatic cleavage of the peptidoglycan at unique sites. Lysostaphin cut at the pentaglycyl cross-bridge and released surface protein with two or three glycyl linked to the carboxyl of threonine (T) in the LPXTG motif (17Schneewind O. Fowler A. Faull K.F. Science. 1995; 268: 103-106Crossref PubMed Scopus (375) Google Scholar, 18Ton-That H. Faull K.F. Schneewind O. J. Biol.

Digestion with the murein hydrolase of staphylococcal phage φ11 released surface protein as two species, one of which contained the branched anchor peptide NH2-l-Ala-d-iGln-l-Lys(Gly5)-d-Ala-COOH linked to the carboxyl of threonine, whereas the other harbored an additional disaccharide moiety (MurNAc-(l-Ala-d-iGln-l-Lys(NH2-Gly5)-d-Ala-d-Ala-COOH)-(β1–4)-GlcNAc) (18Ton-That H. Faull K.F. Schneewind O. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 22285-22292Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar). Analysis of the predicted amino acid sequence of φ11 hydrolase revealed homology to knownN-acetylmuramyl-l-alanine amidases (19Wang A. Wilkinson B.J. Jayaswal R.K. Gene (Amst.). 1991; 102: 105-109Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). Assuming the φ11 enzyme functioned as anN-acetylmuramyl-l-alanine amidase, we previously proposed that staphylococcal surface proteins may be linked to unsubstituted (non-cross-linked) cell wall tetrapeptide (18Ton-That H. Faull K.F. Schneewind O. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 22285-22292Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar). This interpretation is in disagreement with the observed high degree of cross-linking of staphylococcal peptidoglycans (12Tipper D.J. Berman M.F.

To address this issue, we purified and characterized anchor peptides of surface proteins that were released from the staphylococcal peptidoglycan by treatment with mutanolysin, an N-acetylmuramidase of Streptomyces globisporus (23Calandra G.B.

We report elsewhere that φ11 hydrolase displayedN-acetylmuramyl-l-alanine amidase as well asd-alanyl-glycine endopeptidase activity, thereby releasing surface protein linked to unsubstituted cell wall tetrapeptide. 2W. W. Navarre, H. Ton-That, K. F. Faull, and O. Schneewind, manuscript in preparation. We present a refined model of the cell wall anchor structure that accounts for the observed solubilization patterns of surface proteins with murein hydrolases. S. aureus OS2 (pHTT4) was employed for all preparations of staphylococcal cell wall with linked Seb-MH6-Cws (18Ton-That H. Faull K.F. Schneewind O. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 22285-22292Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar). Escherichia coli XL1-Blue was used for the expression of CwlA (29Bullock W.O. Fernandez J.M. Short J.M. BioTechniques. 1987; 5: 376Google Scholar). The coding sequence of theB. subtilis cwlA amidase (27Kuroda A. Sekiguchi J. J. Gen. Microbiol. 1990; 136: 2209-2216Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar) was polymerase chain reaction amplified from B. subtilis MN202 chromosomal DNA using the primers BSA-1 (AAAGGATCCATTAAAGTTGTAAAGAATCTA) and BSA-2 (AAACTGCAGTTACTTCAAGAGAGCTTCAAGT). The polymerase chain reaction product was digested with BamHI and PstI and cloned into the corresponding sites of pQE30 (Qiagen) to generate pWil50. Tryptic soy broth (TSB) was purchased from Difco. Mutanolysin (Sigma) and lysostaphin (Ambi, UK) were purchased and used as recommended by the supplier. 6 liters of S. aureus OS2 (pHTT4) culture were grown overnight in tryptic soy broth (10 μg/ml chloramphenicol). The cells were harvested by centrifugation at 10,000 × g for 15 min, and the supernatant was discarded. Staphylococci were washed in 50 ml of 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, and suspended in the same buffer supplemented with 1 μm pepstatin and 5 mmPMSF. Cell walls were broken with a Bead-Beater instrument (Biospec Products; Bartlesville, OK) by 15 pulses of 40 s each followed by a 5-min incubation period on ice. The lysate was cleared by ultracentrifugation at 32,500 × g for 15 min, and the supernatant was discarded. The sediment was suspended in 50 ml of wash buffer (100 mm potassium phosphate, pH 7.5, 1% Triton X-100, 1 mm PMSF, 1 μm pepstatin), and membrane detergent was extracted by stirring for 3 h at 4 °C. The cell walls were sedimented by centrifugation for 15 min at 32,500 × g, washed three times with 100 mmsodium phosphate, pH 6.0, and once with water, and pellets were stored at −80 °C. Mutanolysin was suspended at a concentration of 5,000 units/ml in 100 mm sodium phosphate, pH 6.0, containing 1 mm PMSF and stored at −20 °C. Cell walls were suspended in 100 mm sodium phosphate buffer, usually 30 ml per peptidoglycan from 6 liters of culture; 10,000 units of mutanolysin, 1 mm PMSF, and 1 μm pepstatin were added followed by a 14-h incubation period at 37 °C. Insoluble material was removed by centrifugation at 32,500 × g for 15 min. The supernatant was adjusted to pH 8.0 by adding 1 mTris-HCl, pH 10.0. Gst-Atl, a hybrid between glutathionine S-transferase and staphylococcal Atl amidase (25Oshida T. Sugai M. Komatsuzawa H. Hong Y.-M. Suginaka H. Tomasz A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 285-289Crossref PubMed Scopus (243) Google Scholar), has been constructed and described elsewhere (30Baba T. Schneewind O. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 4639-4646Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar). An overnight culture of E. coli strain BL21(DE3)(pGst-Atl) was diluted 1:50 into 2 liters of fresh LB medium containing 100 μg/ml ampicillin, incubated with shaking for 3 h at 37 °C, and induced with 1 mmisopentenyl-β-thiogalactoside for another 2 h. Cells were harvested by centrifugation at 8000 × g for 15 min, washed with 25 ml of 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, suspended in 25 ml of F buffer (20% sucrose, 150 mm NaCl, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 1% Triton X-100, 0.03% SDS, 100 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0), and lysed by a single pass through a French press at 6000 psi. Unbroken cells and insoluble material were removed by two centrifugation steps at 20,000 × g for 30 min. The supernatant was subjected to affinity chromatography on glutathione-Sepharose (30Baba T. Schneewind O. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 4639-4646Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar, 31Kaelin W.G. Krek W. Sellers W.R. DeCaprio J.A. Ajchenbaum F. Fuchs C.S. Chittenden T. Li Y. Farnham P.J.

To prepare extracts containing His6-CwlA, an overnight culture of E. coliXL1-Blue (pWil-50) was subcultured 1:50, incubated with shaking at 37 °C for 3 h, and induced with 1 mmisopropylthiogalactopyranoside for another 3 h. Cells were harvested by centrifugation at 10,000 × g for 15 min, suspended in 50 ml of 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, and lysed by a single pass through the French press at 6000 psi. Insoluble material was removed by two centrifugation steps at 20,000 × gfor 10 min. The soluble extract was frozen and stored at −80 °C for future use. For amidase digestion, purified cell walls were suspended in 30 ml of 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5. To this, 5 mg of purified Gst-Atl or 5 ml of His6-CwlA containing E. coli extract were added and incubated for 16 h at 37 °C. Cell wall digests were cleared by two centrifugation steps at 32,500 × g for 15 min. The supernatant was loaded onto a column packed with 1 ml of Ni-NTA resin (Qiagen) equilibrated with 10 ml of buffer Y (10% glycerol, 150 mm NaCl, 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5) at a flow rate of 0.5 ml/min. After loading, the column was washed with 10 ml of buffer Y followed by 15 ml of 2% buffer Z (buffer Y supplemented with 500 mmimidazole) in buffer Y. Seb-MH6-Cws was eluted by a step gradient with 50% buffer Z in buffer Y. Absorbance was monitored at 280 nm, and peak fractions were analyzed for the presence of purified surface protein by 12% SDS-PAGE. Purified Seb-MH6-Cws was precipitated by the addition of an equal volume of methanol:chloroform (5:1) and centrifuged for 10 min at 11,000 × g (32Wessel D. Flügge U.I. Anal. Biochem. 1984; 138: 141-143Crossref PubMed Scopus (3170) Google Scholar). The aqueous phase was discarded, 1 volume of methanol was added to the supernatant and vortexed, and protein was sedimented by centrifugation for 10 min at 11,000 ×g. The supernatant was discarded, and the precipitate was washed with 1 volume of methanol. Pellets were dried under vacuum in a Speed-Vac concentrator (Savant), and protein was dissolved in 1–3 ml of 70% formic acid. About 5 mg of CnBr crystal was added, and the cleavage reaction was incubated for 16–18 h at room temperature in the dark. Samples were dried under vacuum and washed twice with 0.5 ml of water. Pellets were dissolved in 1–2 ml of buffer A (6 mguanidine hydrochloride, 0.1 mNaH2PO4, 0.01 m Tris-HCl, pH 8.0) and loaded onto a column packed with 1 ml of Ni-NTA Sepharose pre-equilibrated with 10 ml of buffer A. The column was washed with 10 ml of each buffer A, buffer B (8 m urea, 100 mmNaH2PO4, 0.01 m Tris-HCl, pH 8.0), and buffer C (same as buffer B, but pH 6.3). Peptides were eluted with 2 ml of buffer D (6 m guanidine hydrochloride, 0.5m acetic acid, pH 4.3) and subjected to RP-HPLC on C18 column (2 × 250 mm, C18 Hypersil, Keystone Scientific). Separation was carried out at 40 °C with a flow rate of 0.2 ml/min and a linear gradient starting 10 min after injection from 99% H2O, 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid to 60% H2O, 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid, and 40% CH3CN in 35 min followed by a steep gradient to 99% CH3CN in 5 min. Eluate absorbance was monitored at 215 nm, and 1-min fractions were collected. Dried HPLC fractions were suspended in CH3CN:water:trifluoroacetic acid (50:50:0.1), typically 50 μl per 1.5 absorbance units at 215 nm. MALDI-MS spectra were obtained on a reflectron time-of-flight instrument (PerSeptive Biosystems Voyager RP) in the linear mode. Samples (0.5 μl) were co-spotted with 0.5 μl of matrix (α-cyano-4-hydroxycinnamic acid, 10 mg/ml in CH3CN:water:TFA (70:30:0.1)). All samples were externally calibrated to a standard of bovine insulin. Anchor peptides solubilized with either Gst-Atl or mutanolysin were reduced by treatment with sodium borohydride (33Glauner B. Höltje J.-V. Schwarz U. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 10088-10095Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). After HPLC purification on C18 column, anchor peptides were dried and suspended in 200 μl of water. To the peptides, 200 μl of 0.5 m sodium borate buffer, pH 9.0, was added followed by the immediate addition of 1–3 mg of solid sodium borohydride. The reaction was incubated for 30 min at room temperature and quenched by the addition of 20 μl of 20% phosphoric acid. Reduced peptides were desalted over a C18 cartridge (Analtech), dried under vacuum, and suspended in 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5. The glycyl-glycine endopeptidase lysostaphin (Ambi) was added at a concentration of 200 μg/ml and incubated overnight at 37 °C. Lysostaphin digestion was terminated by the addition of trifluoroacetic acid to a concentration of 10%. Samples were placed on ice to precipitate lysostaphin, which was separated from the soluble muropeptides by centrifugation at 15,000 × g for 15 min. Separation of muropeptides by RP-HPLC on C18 column (2 × 250 mm, C18 Hypersil, Keystone Scientific) was carried out using a method devised for E. coli wall peptides (33Glauner B. Höltje J.-V. Schwarz U. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 10088-10095Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 34Glauner B. Höltje J.-V. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 18988-18996Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and modified for the separation of S. aureus muropeptides (35de Jonge B.L.M. Sidow T. Chang Y.S. Labischinski H. Berger-Bächi B. Gage D.A. Tomasz A. J. Bacteriol. 1993; 175: 2779-2782Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Briefly, peptides were chromatographed by a linear reversed phase gradient from 5% (v/v) methanol in 100 mmNaH2PO4 (pH 2.5) to 30% (v/v) methanol in 100 mm NaH2PO4 (pH 2.8) in 100 min. Baseline drift was accounted for by subtracting the chromatogram of a blank run. Eluate absorbance was monitored at 206 nm, and peak fractions were desalted using a C18 cartridge and dried under vacuum prior to analysis by ESI-MS. Dried muropeptides were dissolved in 30 μl of water:CH3CN:formic acid (50:50:0.1). A Perkin Elmer Sciex API III triple quadrupole mass spectrometer was tuned and calibrated by flow injection (10 μl/min) of a mixture of PPG 425, 1000, 2000 (3.3 × 10−5, 1 × 10−4, and 2 × 10−4m, respectively) in water:methanol (1:1) containing 2 mm ammonium formate and 0.1% CH3CN. Calibration across the m/z range 10–2400 was achieved by multiple ion monitoring of eight PPG solution signals (singly charged ions at m/z 58.99, 326.25, 906.67, 1254.92, 1545.13, 1863.34, and 2010.47 and the doubly charged ion atm/z 520.4). The ion spray voltage was operated at 4.5 kV using hydrocarbon-depleted air for spray nebulization, and spectra were generated with a curtain gas produced from the vapors of liquid nitrogen. Samples were introduced into the ionization source by flow injection. ESI-MS spectra were obtained at instrument conditions sufficient to resolve the isotopes of the PPG/NH4+ singly charged ion at m/z906 with 40% valley, an orifice voltage of 60, and step size during data collection of 0.3 Da. Daughter ion spectra were obtained using degraded mass resolution to improve sensitivity of detection, and a step size of 1 Da was used for data collection. Under these conditions, the isotopes of the PPG/NH4+ single charged ion at m/z 906 were not resolved from one another. Previous work developed an experimental scheme for the analysis of anchor peptides of staphylococcal surface proteins (18Ton-That H. Faull K.F. Schneewind O. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 22285-22292Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar). The hybrid Seb-MH6-Cws contains the protein A sorting signal fused to the COOH terminus of Seb. At the fusion joint, a methionine followed by six histidines is inserted (Fig. 1). After enzymatic solubilization of the staphylococcal cell wall, Seb-MH6-Cws is purified by affinity chromatography on nickel Sepharose. COOH-terminal anchor peptides are generated by CnBr cleavage at methionyl, purified by a second round of affinity chromatography, and analyzed by mass spectrometry. Isolated staphylococcal peptidoglycan was digested with lysostaphin, φ11 hydrolase, mutanolysin, autolysin, or lysin A, and purified Seb-MH6-Cws was analyzed on Coomassie-stained SDS-PAGE (Fig. 1 C). As previously observed, lysostaphin-cut Seb-MH6-Cws migrated faster on SDS-PAGE than the two species obtained after φ11 hydrolase digestion (18Ton-That H. Faull K.F. Schneewind O. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 22285-22292Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar). Mutanolysin, anN-acetylmuramidase that cut at the β1–4 glycosidic linkage between MurNAc and GlcNAc (23Calandra G.B. Cole R. Infect. Immun. 1980; 28: 1033-1037Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), solubilized Seb-MH6-Cws as a spectrum of fragments with increasing mass, all of which migrated more slowly on SDS-PAGE than the lysostaphin-digested counterpart.N-Acetylmuramyl-l-alanine amidases, S. aureus Atl (25Oshida T. Sugai M. Komatsuzawa H. Hong Y.-M. Suginaka H. Tomasz A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 285-289Crossref PubMed Scopus (243) Google Scholar), and B. subtilis CwlA (27Kuroda A. Sekiguchi J. J. Gen. Microbiol. 1990; 136: 2209-2216Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar) also released Seb-MH6-Cws as a spectrum of fragments with different mass. Most amidase-released species migrated more slowly on SDS-PAGE than then lysostaphin-cut counterpart, indicating surface protein attachment to cross-linked peptidoglycan. These results suggested that φ11 hydrolase cut the staphylococcal cell wall not only at the N-acetylmuramyl-l-Ala amide bond but also at the peptidoglycan cross-bridge, thereby releasing Seb-MH6-Cws linked to unsubstituted (non-cross-linked) tetrapeptide. Amidase-treated samples also contained a prominent species of Seb-MH6-Cws that migrated faster on SDS-PAGE than the lysostaphin-solubilized counterpart. This species was characterized to be the product of proteolytic cleavage between the glutamine (Q) and the alanine (A) upstream of the LPXTG motif during sample preparation (AQ/ALPETG, data not shown). To analyze the structure of mutanolysin-solubilized anchor peptides, the CnBr cut fragments were purified by affinity chromatography. The eluate was rechromatographed by RP-HPLC to separate COOH-terminal anchor peptides from contaminating peptides generated by incomplete CnBr cleavage (18Ton-That H. Faull K.F. Schneewind O. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 22285-22292Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar). Two peaks of absorption at 215 nm were observed for these samples. The peak that eluted at 27% CH3CN was composed of COOH-terminal anchor peptides, whereas the peak that eluted at 33% CH3CN contained additional peptide sequence (NH2-VDSKDVKIEVYLTTKKGTMHHHHHHAQALPET-cell wall anchor) (Fig. 2 A, data not shown). Mutanolysin-solubilized anchor peptides were analyzed by MALDI-MS (Fig. 2 B). The mass of anchor peptide linked to a single murein pentapeptide unit, MurNAc-[l-Ala-d-iGln-l-Lys-(NH2-HHHHHHAQALPET-Gly5)-d-Ala-d-Ala-COOH](β1–4)-GlcNAc, was calculated to be 2785.88 [M+H]+, which was in agreement with the observation of a strong signal at m/z2786. Nevertheless, we also expected signals for anchor peptide linked to cell wall tetrapeptide as well as theN,O-6-diacetylated muramoyl species of the staphylococcal peptidoglycan (5Ghuysen J.-M. Strominger J.L. Biochemistry. 1963; 2: 1119-1125Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). Close examination of the spectrum revealed compounds with m/z 2716, 2744, 2758, 2786, 2814, 2828, and 2856. The measurement of m/z 2716 was consistent with the mass of anchor peptide linked to cell wall tetrapeptide (calculated mass 2714.80, MurNAc-(l-Ala-d-iGln-l-Lys-(NH2-HHHHHHAQALPET-Gly5)-d-Ala-COOH)-(β1–4)-GlcNAc), whereas the observed ions at m/z 2758 and 2828 were explained as the N,O-6-diacetylated muramoyl species of the compounds with m/z 2716 and 2786. Ions withm/z 2744, 2813, and 2856 differed by an average mass of 28 from those at m/z 2716, 2786, and 2828, respectively. Signals with mass deviation of 28 were observed routinely for CnBr-cleaved anchor peptides and were likely due to formylation of anchor peptides during the incubation in 70% formic acid (18Ton-That H. Faull K.F. Schneewind O. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 22285-22292Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar). Mutanolysin digestion of the staphylococcal cell wall released Seb-MH6-Cws as a spectrum of fragments, indicating that anchor peptides must be tethered to cross-linked peptidoglycan. The mass of a murein subunit, MurNAc-(l-Ala-d-iGln-l-Lys-(Gly5)-d-Ala)-(β1–4)-GlcNAc, was calculated to be 1162.16 Da and 1204.19 Da for theN,O-6-diacetylated muramoyl species, respectively. Observed ion signals at m/z 2786, 3991, 5153, and 6357 differed from one another by mass increments of 1205, 1162, and 1204 Da, suggesting that these signals were generated by anchor peptides linked to one, two, or three murein subunits.N,O-6-diacetylation is known to occur at approximately half of all muramoyl residues in the staphylococcal peptidoglycan (5Ghuysen J.-M.

https://openalex.org/W2077118277,"Protease-activated receptor 1 (PAR1), a G protein-coupled, protease-activated receptor for the serine protease thrombin, is activated when thrombin cleaves its amino-terminal exodomain. This irreversible mechanism of activation may have necessitated an unusual pattern of receptor trafficking. Unactivated PAR1 cycles tonically between the cell surface and an intracellular pool, providing an intracellular store of uncleaved receptors and allowing repopulation of the surface with uncleaved receptors after thrombin exposure without new receptor synthesis. Activated PAR1 internalizes rapidly and is degraded in lysosomes. We report characterization of a PAR1 mutant that trafficked like the wild-type receptor when activated but did not internalize and recycle in the absence of agonist. This complements a previous study in which a mutant with normal tonic internalization but defective agonist-triggered internalization was described. These observations suggest that the trafficking behaviors of unactivated and activated PAR1 are specified by distinct signals within the receptor and imply that PAR1 internalization in the presence or absence of agonist may be mediated by distinct molecular machinery. PAR1 mutants that did not internalize in the absence of agonist were also shown to localize exclusively to the cell surface and to be defective in their ability to repopulate the cell surface with uncleaved receptors after thrombin exposure. These observations suggest that tonic internalization is necessary for maintenance of the intracellular PAR1 pool."

The disulfide-linked homodimeric product contains N-terminal heparin-binding sites that were utilized as intrinsic affinity tags to obtain a highly enriched preparation in one chromatographic step. A subsequent C4 reverse phase high pressure liquid chromatography step provides high purity, salt-free protein that is amenable to biophysical and structural studies at a yield of approximately 3 mg/liter of bacterial culture. The dimeric protein is correctly folded as determined by electrophoretic, spectroscopic, chemical, and proteolytic analyses. Refolded DPP is also bioactive as shown by induction of chondrogenesis in embryonic chick limb bud cells and by high affinity binding to Noggin, an antagonist of bone morphogenetic protein signaling. In contrast to bone morphogenetic proteins extracted from demineralized bone or overexpressed in cell culture, the refolded <i>Escherichia coli</i>-expressed protein is not glycosylated at a conserved <i>N</i>-linked site and is therefore homogeneous. The C-terminal domain dimer is more hydrophobic and thus less soluble than its unfolded or partially folded forms, necessitating highly solubilizing conditions for recovery after folding<i>in vitro</i>. Hence solubilization of the mature ligand may be one of the principal roles of the large (250–400 amino acids) N-terminal prodomains of transforming growth factor-β superfamily members, shown to act as intramolecular chaperones <i>in vivo</i>."

Sequence alignment of PTPα-D1 and -D2 with the D1 domains of other receptor-like PTPs, and modeling of the PTPα-D1 and -D2 structures, identified two non-conserved amino acids in PTPα-D2 that may account for its low activity.

Protein tyrosine phosphorylation status is a key determinant of nearly all eukaryotic cell processes and is controlled by the protein-tyrosine kinases and phosphatases (PTPs).1 Phosphotyrosine hydrolysis is catalyzed by members of the large and diverse PTP superfamily, and although the specific roles of most of these enzymes have yet to be determined, they can positively or negatively regulate cellular signaling pathways (1Tonks N.K. Neel B.G. Cell. 1996; 87: 365-368Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (495) Google Scholar, 2Streuli M. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1996; 8: 182-188Crossref PubMed Scopus (165) Google Scholar). The PTPs include enzymes with absolute specificity for phosphotyrosine as well as dual specificity enzymes that can also dephosphorylate serine and threonine residues. Most do not share significant sequence identity, with the exception of the phosphotyrosine-specific receptor and non-receptor-like PTPs, which have stretches of amino acid identity throughout their catalytic domains. Nevertheless, despite dissimilarities in primary sequence, PTPs from diverse subgroups have a remarkably conserved tertiary structure and predicted catalytic mechanism (3Denu J.M. Stuckey J.A.

Sci. 1996; 21: 413-417Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (319) Google Scholar). Enzymological and mutational studies have elucidated several features of the catalytic mechanism of PTPs (5Zhang Z.-Y. Crit. Rev. Biochem. Mol. Biol. 1998; 33: 1-52Crossref PubMed Scopus (252) Google Scholar). All have an absolutely conserved CX5R motif in the active site and nucleophilic attack on the phosphate ester by this essential cysteine results in the formation of a covalent thiophosphate intermediate (6Guan K.L.

Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 15266-15270Crossref PubMed Scopus (171) Google Scholar). This phosphate transfer is facilitated by proton donation to the phenolic oxygen of phosphotyrosine from a general acid, identified in the tyrosine-specific PTP1 and Yop51 from Yersinia as the aspartate residue within a conserved WPD motif about 30–40 residues N-terminal to the active site sequence (9Zhang Z.-Y.

U. S. A. 1996; 93: 2493-2498Crossref PubMed Scopus (252) Google Scholar). Subsequent transfer of the phosphate to water is likely aided by the same aspartate residue acting as a general base (10Denu J.M. Lohse D.L. Vijayalakshmi J. Saper M.A. Dixon J.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 2493-2498Crossref PubMed Scopus (252) Google Scholar). The crystal structures of several PTPs support this mechanism and have further shown that the CX5R lies at the base of a phosphotyrosine-binding pocket, with substrate binding inducing the movement of a loop containing the WPD sequence so that the aspartate residue is brought into the catalytic site and in proximity to the leaving group oxygen (11Barford D.

Many receptor-like PTPs (RPTPs) have the structural distinction of possessing two homologous tandem catalytic domains in the intracellular region, raising the intriguing question of the functional roles of each repeat. The first, or membrane proximal domains (D1) of LAR, CD45, PTPμ, and PTPε are catalytically active, whereas the second or membrane distal domains (D2) have either no detectable or extremely lowin vitro activity, usually less than 0.1% of the activity of D1 (14Streuli M.

Where studied, there is also no evidence for an in vivo catalytic action of D2, as the inactivation of D2 of CD45 does not detectably affect the action of CD45 in T cell activation (20Desai D.M.

A novel interaction of D2 of PTPδ with D1 of PTPς inhibits PTPς-D1 activity in in vitro assays, suggesting a role for D2 in regulating the formation and activity of receptor heterodimers (22Wallace M. Fladd C. Batt J. Rotin D. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 2608-2616Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). On the other hand, the D2 domain of PTPα is exceptional in exhibitingin vitro catalytic activity of up to about 10% of D1 activity toward certain substrates (19Lim K.L. Lai D.S.Y. Kalousek M.B.

The relatively high activity of PTPα-D2 is due to two factors, the higher intrinsic activity of PTPα-D2 compared with other D2 domains and the lower activity of PTPα-D1 compared with other D1 domains (19Lim K.L. Lai D.S.Y. Kalousek M.B. Wang Y. Pallen C.J. Eur. J. Biochem. 1997; 245: 693-700Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). Structure-function studies of PTPα-D2 present a unique opportunity to assess the minimal sequence requirements that might distinguish the characteristic catalytic properties of the homologous D1 and D2 domains. Most of the highly conserved and invariant residues among the tyrosine-specific PTPs are found within or near the catalytic cleft and are involved in interaction with phosphotyrosine or in actual hydrolysis (12Stuckey J.A. Schubert H.L. Fauman E.B. Zhang Z.-Y. Dixon J.E. Saper M.A. Nature. 1994; 370: 571-575Crossref PubMed Scopus (378) Google Scholar, 13Jia Z. Barford D. Flint A.J. Tonks N.K. Science. 1995; 268: 1754-1758Crossref PubMed Scopus (558) Google Scholar). Mutation of many of these residues impairs PTP activity (8Zhang Z.-Y. Wang Y. Wu L. Fauman E.B. Stuckey J.A. Schubert H.L.

A. 1997; 94: 1680-1685Crossref PubMed Scopus (685) Google Scholar). The lack of certain of these apparently critical residues in PTPα-D2 suggests that its low activity may simply be due to defective substrate binding or catalysis. If so, this would imply a non-catalytic role for D2 rather than an enzymatic function. To investigate this possibility, we have mutated two atypical residues in PTPα-D2 to conform to the corresponding amino acid found in all other tyrosine-specific PTPs with activity. One such residue is the putative general acid of D2 necessary for formation of the thiophosphate intermediate. The other is a residue that, in PTP1B, is located at the top of the catalytic cleft where it interacts with phosphotyrosine of the substrate (13Jia Z. Barford D. Flint A.J. Tonks N.K. Science. 1995; 268: 1754-1758Crossref PubMed Scopus (558) Google Scholar). The in vitro and in vivo activities of the D2 single and double mutants, as well as those of D1 single and double mutants possessing wild-type D2 residues in these positions, have been analyzed. Modeling of structures was performed using LOOK (Molecular Applications Group). Sequences of D1 and D2 were initially aligned to the target sequence of PTP1B (sequence identities of 47 and 41%, respectively), and the structure was subsequently modeled based on the algorithm of Lee and Subbiah (the algorithm uses self-consistent ensemble optimization to determine the global minimum structure resulting in the location of side chains with high accuracy) (27Lee C. Subbiah S. J. Mol. Biol. 1991; 217: 373-388Crossref PubMed Scopus (249) Google Scholar). The target structure was the complexed form of PTP1B(C215S) with phosphotyrosyl-hexapeptide (13Jia Z. Barford D. Flint A.J. Tonks N.K. Science. 1995; 268: 1754-1758Crossref PubMed Scopus (558) Google Scholar). Numbering of the PTPα amino acid sequence is according to Krueger et al. (28Krueger N.X. Streuli M. Saito H. EMBO J. 1990; 9: 3241-3252Crossref PubMed Scopus (370) Google Scholar). The bacterial expression plasmids pGEX-KG containing PTPα-D1 or -D2 have been described (19Lim K.L. Lai D.S.Y. Kalousek M.B. Wang Y. Pallen C.J. Eur. J. Biochem. 1997; 245: 693-700Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar), and they served as template for polymerase chain reaction site-directed mutagenesis. For the WPD mutants, the forward mutant primer sequences were 5′-ACCAGCTGGCCAGAATTTGGGGTG-3′ for D1(D382E), 5′-ACCAGCTGGCCAGCCTTTGGGGTG-3′ for D1(D382A), 5′-CATGGCTGGCCTGACGTGGGCATC-3′ for D2(E671D), and 5′-CATGGCTGGCCTGCAGTGGGCATC-3′ for D2(E671A). For the KNRY mutants, the reverse primer sequences were 5′-CAGGTGGACTCTAGAGTGGTCATAAGGCAAGATGTTTACAACTCGATTTTTTTC-3′ for D1(Y243V) and 5′-CACTCTGTTGAATTCATATGGAATGATCTGTAAATAACGGTTCTTCTT-3′ for D2(V536Y). The pGEX-KG-PTPα-D1(Y243V/D382E) was constructed by removing appropriate restriction fragments from pGEX-KG-PTPα-D1(D382E) and pGEX-KG-PTPα-D1(Y243V) and assembling them together so that they contained the double mutation. A similar strategy was used in the construction of pGEX-KG-PTPα-D2(V536Y/E671D). All mutations introduced by polymerase chain reaction were confirmed by DNA sequencing, and no extraneous mutations were found. Restricted fragments of these mutants encompassing the desired mutations and most of the catalytic domain were used to replace homologous fragments of the full-length PTPα in the expression vector pXJ41-neo, where PTPα already contained an inactivating Cys to Ser mutation in D1 (C414S) and D2 (C704S) (30Bhandari V. Lim K.L. Pallen C.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 8691-8698Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). The plasmids pXJ41-PTPα-D1(C414S)D2-neo and pXJ41PTPα-D1D2(C704S)-neo were constructed by replacing D1 or D2 within pXJ41-PTPα-neo with a corresponding restriction fragment encompassing D1(C414S) or D2(C704S) that was derived from pXJ41-PTPα-D1(C414S)D2(C704S)-neo. The Cys to Ser mutations are denoted in the figure legends as a subscript S following the domain containing the mutation. These plasmids and those containing wild-type PTPα (pXJ41-PTPα-neo) (29Zheng X.M. Wang Y. Pallen C.J. Nature. 1992; 359: 336-339Crossref PubMed Scopus (387) Google Scholar) or PTPα-D1(C414S)D2(C704S) (19Lim K.L. Lai D.S.Y. Kalousek M.B. Wang Y. Pallen C.J. Eur. J. Biochem. 1997; 245: 693-700Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar) were subsequently used for cotransfection studies with p59fyn in COS-1 cells. The expression vector pXJ41-neo-p59fyn has been described (30Bhandari V. Lim K.L. Pallen C.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 8691-8698Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). The expression, purification, quantitation, and storage of GST-PTPα fusion proteins have been previously described (19Lim K.L. Lai D.S.Y. Kalousek M.B. Wang Y. Pallen C.J. Eur. J. Biochem. 1997; 245: 693-700Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). Phosphatase activity toward RR-src was measured in 30-μl reactions containing 50 mm Mes (pH 6.0), 0.5 mg/ml bovine serum albumin, and 0.5 mmdithiothreitol. Dephosphorylation of pNPP was measured in 450-μl reactions containing 50 mm sodium acetate (pH 5.5), 0.5 mg/ml bovine serum albumin, and 0.5 mm dithiothreitol. ForK m and V max determinations, RR-src concentrations generally ranged from 2.0 to 25 μm, and pNPP concentrations ranged from 0.5 to 10 mm. All reactions were carried out at 30 °C and terminated during the linear portion of the reaction. Released 32P orp-nitrophenol was quantitated as described previously (23Wang Y. Pallen C.J. EMBO J. 1991; 10: 3231-3237Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar). Phosphatase activity was plotted against substrate concentration in the form of a Lineweaver-Burk plot and manually extrapolated to determineK m and V max values. COS-1 cells were obtained from American Type Culture Collection (Rockville, MD). Cells were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum and penicillin/streptomycin in an atmosphere of 5% CO2 at 37 °C. Prior to transfection, confluent monolayers of COS-1 cells were trypsinized and replated in 60- or 100-mm tissue culture dishes and incubated for 16 h until 50–70% confluency. Cells were transfected with 2–4 μg of plasmid DNA by liposome-mediated transfection with 10 μl (1 mg/ml) (60-mm dishes) or 30 μl (1 mg/ml) (100-mm dishes) of Lipofectin or LipofectAMINE reagent (Life Technologies, Inc.) for 6 h as described by the manufacturer and maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum for an additional 18 h prior to harvesting. The empty expression plasmid pXJ41neo was used to normalize the amount of DNA in each transfection. Equivalent amount of the various forms of PTPα were expressed. The preparation of cell extracts and subsequent Western blot procedures have been described (30Bhandari V. Lim K.L. Pallen C.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 8691-8698Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). Membranes were immunoblotted with anti-PTPα-D1 antiserum (no. 2205, raised against a GST-PTPα fusion protein containing the first catalytic domain of PTPα) (1:1000) and followed by goat anti-rabbit IgG conjugated to peroxidase (Sigma) (1:2500), anti-p59fyn monoclonal antibody (Transduction Laboratories) (1:300) followed by goat anti-mouse IgG conjugated to peroxidase (1:2500), or peroxidase-conjugated anti-phosphotyrosine antibody (Transduction Laboratories) (1:2000). Immunoblots were developed using the ECL system (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). For immunoprecipitation of p59fyn, anti-p59fyn (FYN3, Santa Cruz) was added to the cell lysates (1 μl per 100 μg of protein) and incubated for 2 h at 4 °C. Protein A cell suspension (Sigma) was then added and mixed at 4 °C for 2 h. After low speed centrifugation, the immunoprecipitates were washed twice each with lysis buffer and once in 2× kinase assay buffer containing 10 mm Pipes (pH 7.0), 5 mm MnCl2, and 0.5 mmdithiothreitol. Part of the immunoprecipitates were used in kinase assays to measure p59fyn autophosphorylation as described previously (30Bhandari V. Lim K.L. Pallen C.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 8691-8698Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). Other portions of the immunoprecipitates were probed for p59fyn as described above. The p59fyn level, phosphotyrosine content, and kinase activity were quantitated using a GS700 Bio-Rad densitometer. Alignment of the amino acid sequences of the catalytic D1 domains of 16 active mammalian receptor-like PTPs shows that they possess 42 invariant residues, highlighted in the amino acid sequence of PTPα-D1 (Fig. 1 A). No D2 domain of these RPTPs possesses all 42 invariant residues, although PTPα-D2 is only lacking 3 of them: a tyrosine at position 536, a leucine at position 549, and an aspartate at position 671 (Fig. 1 A). In fact, all of the D2 domains examined are lacking the corresponding tyrosine and aspartate residues, suggesting that the substitution of these residues may be a common denonimator that, in the absence of other obvious defects (for example, the substitution of the essential cysteine residue in the active site of PTPγ, PTPζ, and PTP-OST), accounts for low D2 activity. Furthermore, the counterpart Tyr in the KNRY motif and the Asp in the WPD motif of non-receptor PTP1B are involved in interactions with the substrate. The crystal structures of PTP1B complexed with phosphopeptide shows that the corresponding invariant tyrosine (Tyr-46) interacts with the phenyl ring of phosphotyrosine of the substrate (13Jia Z. Barford D. Flint A.J. Tonks N.K. Science. 1995; 268: 1754-1758Crossref PubMed Scopus (558) Google Scholar). This tyrosine is one of several hydrophobic, conserved residues that form the recognition site for phosphotyrosine. In the PTP1B structure, the invariant aspartate (Asp-181) is found in the movable WPD loop and is brought into the catalytic site upon substrate binding, where it acts as a general acid to facilitate phosphoester hydrolysis. The involvement of these residues in substrate binding and catalysis suggests that their altered nature in PTPα-D2 could have profound effects on phosphatase activity. To see if the substitution of these two invariant residues in PTPα-D2 affected D2 structure, we modeled PTPα-D1 and -D2 (Fig. 1 B). Although the x-ray structure of PTPα-D1 has been reported (31Bilwes A.M. den Hertog J. Hunter T. Noel J.P. Nature. 1996; 382: 555-559Crossref PubMed Scopus (292) Google Scholar), it is not complexed with substrate, so models were prepared based on the structure of PTP1B complexed with phosphopeptide (13Jia Z. Barford D. Flint A.J. Tonks N.K. Science. 1995; 268: 1754-1758Crossref PubMed Scopus (558) Google Scholar). Inspection of all three superimposed structures showed that the molecules were largely similar. One area of interest and notable difference among the structures was the WPD loop region. The carboxylate group of Asp-382 in PTPα-D1 sits close to the phosphate (approximately 4 Å), whereas the carboxylate group of Glu-671 in the WPE loop of PTPα-D2 sits about 7.45 Å from the phosphate, likely due to the larger glutamate side chain having steric hindrance as well as repulsive forces from adjacent negative charges within the active site pocket (Fig. 1 B, inset). The distances between these carboxylate groups and the phenolic oxygen are 3.7 and 6.94 Å, respectively (not shown). The aspartate thus fits within the active site, whereas the glutamate is forced to remain at a distance from active site residues. Additional models were made of mutants where the loop sequence of PTPα-D1 was changed to WPE and that of PTPα-D2 to WPD (data not shown). The resulting models had the aspartate and glutamate residues at the expected locations so that glutamate was outside the active site pocket and aspartate was nestled inside the pocket of D2. The conserved KNRY region containing the invariant tyrosine (recognition region) was also analyzed. The model reveals that, as in PTP1B, Tyr-243 of PTPα-D1 supplies a hydrophobic environment to the phosphotyrosine-binding pocket. The Val-536 in the analogous sequence position in PTPα-D2 could result in reduced tenacity of binding due to the absence of a complementary surface for phosphotyrosines. The roles of Val-536 and Glu-671 in PTPα-D2 catalysis were tested by mutating these residues, singly and in combination, to the corresponding residues in PTPα-D1. Likewise, the counterpart invariant residues Tyr-243 and Asp-382 of PTPα-D1 were mutated to those present in PTPα-D2. A schematic representation of these mutants is shown in Fig. 2 A. Recombinant wild-type and mutant forms of the PTPα catalytic domains were expressed as GST-fusion proteins and cleaved with thrombin. The integrity, purity, and amounts of the released PTPα proteins were evaluated by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (Fig. 2 B) and densitometric scanning prior to the assays described below. To test the theory that proton donation to the phenolic oxygen of phosphotyrosine by the more distant hydroxyl moiety of glutamate in wild-type PTPα-D2 would be less catalytically favorable than from a closer hydroxyl moiety of aspartate, Glu-671 was mutated to either Asp or Ala (E671D and E671A, respectively). The kinetic parameters of activity of these PTPα-D2 mutants were assayed toward pNPP and the RR-src phosphotyrosyl peptide. As predicted, the E671D substitution positively affected PTPα-D2 activity toward pNPP, resulting in an enzyme with a 10-fold increased turnover number (k cat) intermediate to those of wild-type PTPα-D1 and -D2 and with an overall 4-fold increase in catalytic efficiency ratio (k cat/K m) (Table I). In contrast, the E671D substitution had surprisingly little effect on the kinetics of RR-src dephosphorylation by PTPα-D2 (Table I), indicating that Glu-671 in wild-type D2 is not responsible for the very low activity toward this substrate. Consistent with a role for Glu-671 as a general acid in catalysis, the PTPα-D2 E671A mutant exhibited less favorableK m and V max values than wild-type D2, with a 60-fold reduction in the catalytic efficiency ratio of pNPP dephosphorylation and such low activity toward RR-src that it could not be reliably measured (Table I).Table IKinetic parameters of activity of WPD and KNRY mutants of PTPαpNPPRR-srcK mV maxk catk cat/K mK mV maxk catk cat/K mmmnmol/min/mgs−1m−1s−1(102)mmnmol/min/mgs−1m−1s−1(102)PTPα-D11-aValues as previously determined in Ref. 19.0.281887211.644160.03380004.931494PTPα-D1(D382E)1.9422761.407.220.049400.024.08(±0.25)(±74)(±0.014)(±12)PTPα-D1(D382A)1.471770.110.750.0391.509.25 × 10−40.24(±0.25)(±4)(±0.009)(±0.29)PTPα-D1(Y243V)2.2365464.0418.10.153210.010.65(±0.55)(±543)(±0.041)(±3)PTPα-D1(Y243V/D382E)3.124550.280.900.1380.160.99 × 10−40.01(±0.27)(±16)(±0.049)(±0.07)PTPα-D21-aValues as previously determined in Ref. 19.1.689240.513.040.1330.6673.67 × 10−40.03PTPα-D2(E671D)3.8688024.8412.50.1330.8334.58 × 10−40.03(±0.25)(±736)(±0.047)(±0.24)PTPα-D2(E671A)3.81350.020.05ND1-bND, not determined.ND1-bND, not determined.(±0.96)(±11)PTPα-D2(V536Y)0.4539662.1848.40.0932.3312.8 × 10−40.14(±0.02)(±142)(±0.028)(±0.72)PTPα-D2(V536Y/E671D)0.766299634.654560.112580.032.68(±0.10)(±5633)(±0.023)(±25)The K m and V max values represent the mean ± S.E. of experiments conducted with at least three independent preparations of purified proteins.1-a Values as previously determined in Ref. 19Lim K.L.

Open table in a new tab The K m and V max values represent the mean ± S.E. of experiments conducted with at least three independent preparations of purified proteins. The mutation of Asp-382 to Glu or Ala in PTPα-D1 (D382E or D382A, respectively) had pronounced effects on the kinetics of dephosphorylation of pNPP and RR-src peptide (Table I). Toward pNPP, the PTPα-D1 D382E mutant exhibited a 7-fold increase in K m and an 8-fold decrease in V max relative to wild-type PTPα-D1, resulting in a turnover number and a catalytic efficiency ratio only 2–3-fold higher than wild-type PTPα-D2. However, toward RR-src, the PTPα-D1 D382E mutant had an essentially unchanged K m value relative to wild-type PTPα-D1, whereas theV max decreased 200-fold. Despite this,k cat and the catalytic efficiency ratio of this mutant D1 were still 54- and 136-fold higher than those of wild-type D2. The D1 mutant containing alanine rather than an acidic residue in position 382 (D382A) exhibited K m values similar to those of the D382E mutant for both substrates but had a further reduced rate of activity (Table I). The D1(D382A) mutant and wild-type D1 showed no essential difference in K m values for RR-src, although the K m of the mutant for pNPP was about 5-fold higher than that of wild-type D1 (Table I). The latter contrasts with a report that this same mutation in PTPα-D1 has virtually no effect on the K m for pNPP (24Wu L. Buist A. den Hertog J. Zhang Z.-Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 6994-7002Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). We do not know the reason for this difference, but in our experiments the mutation of Glu-671 to Ala in D2 had a similar effect on theK m value for pNPP (Table I). The catalytic efficiency ratios of PTPα-D1 D382A were about 560- and 6200-fold lower than wild-type D1 for pNPP and RR-src, respectively, consistent with a role of Asp-382 as a general acid in catalysis. The above results suggest that in the case of pNPP, PTPα-D1 and -D2 can be induced to behave more, but not entirely, like the other catalytic domain (i.e., D1 like D2 and vice versa) by mutation of their different putative general acids to that present in the counterpart domain, but in the case of the peptide substrate RR-src, the D1 a"

This analysis showed that individually mutating Leu-205 or Glu-241 to alanine completely abolished LFA-1 binding to ICAM-1 or -2 without affecting I-domain structure, as assayed by antibody binding. Mutating Thr-243 to alanine also had a profound effect on LFA-1 binding to ICAM-1 and -2, as seen by complete loss of binding to ICAM-1 and a significant reduction (70% decrease) in binding to ICAM-2. Mutating Glu-146 to alanine reduced LFA-1 binding to ICAM-1 or -2 by 70%, and mutating His-264 or Glu-293 to alanine reduced binding to ICAM-1 or -2 by about 30–40%. Mutating Thr-175 to alanine reduced binding to ICAM-1 by about 30% and binding to ICAM-2 by about 70%. Interestingly, mutating Lys-263 to alanine preferentially abolished LFA-1 binding to ICAM-2. Using these data, we have generated a model of the interface between the LFA-1 I-domain and residues in the first domain of ICAM-1 that have been shown to be critical for this interaction.

Leukocyte function-associated antigen-1 (LFA-1)1 is a member of the leukocyte integrin family. Like other members of this family, it is expressed exclusively on leukocytes and shares a common β-chain (β2, CD18). The four members of this family that differ in their α-chains are LFA-1 (CD11a, αL), Mac-1 (CD11b, αM), p150,95 (CD11c, αX), and αdβ2 (CD11d, αd). LFA-1 is constitutively expressed on the cell surface and is thought to undergo a conformational change that renders it capable of high affinity ligand binding. The primary ligands for LFA-1 are intercellular adhesion molecules-1, -2, and -3 (ICAM-1, -2, and -3). The interaction of ICAM-3 with LFA-1 is of considerably lower affinity than ICAM-1 or -2 binding to LFA-1 (1Binnerts M.E. van Kooyk Y. Simmons D.L. Figdor C.G. Eur. J.

Immunol. 1997; 158: 928-936PubMed Google Scholar). The role of these two new ligands has yet to be established. Much of our understanding of the binding of β2 integrins to ligands comes from analysis of the LFA-1/ICAM-1 interaction and the Mac-1/ICAM-1, iC3b, or fibrinogen interaction. The α-chains of all the β2 integrins contain a region of approximately 200 amino acids, called the inserted or I-domain, that is N-terminal to the divalent cation binding EF hand motifs. In addition, the α1, α2, and αE integrin subunits contain an I-domain, which is also known as the A-domain and was first identified as a sequence motif in von Willibrand factor. Both the I-domains and the EF hand motifs have been shown to bind divalent cations. A large body of evidence suggests that the I-domain plays a critical role in the binding of these integrins to their respective ligands. Numerous function-blocking antibodies to LFA-1, Mac-1, p150,95, α1β1, and α2β1 map to their respective I-domains (16Champe M. McIntyre B.W. Berman P.W. J. Biol.

High resolution crystal structures of the CD11a and CD11b I-domains, as well as the α2 I-domain, have been solved (27Qu A. Leahy D.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

The cation coordinating amino acids are located on one face of the I-domain. It has been hypothesized that the region of the I-domain that coordinates cation binding (Asp-137, Ser-139, Ser-141, Thr-206, and Asp-239 in CD11a) is part of the ligand binding surface (28Lee J.-O. Rieu P. Arnaout M.A. Liddington R. Cell. 1995; 80: 631-638Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (806) Google Scholar). In addition, mutagenesis of the LFA-1 I-domain showed that amino acids outside the cation binding domain contribute to ICAM-1 binding (30Huang C. Springer T.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 19008-19016Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar). Using a two-step approach consisting of alanine scanning mutagenesis and targeted mutagenesis based on the crystal structure, we have carried out extensive mutagenesis of the LFA-1 I-domain and have identified amino acids that are critical to LFA-1 binding to ICAM-1 and ICAM-2. Using this information, we have generated a model of the binding interface between the I-domain and the first Ig-like domain of ICAM-1, which accounts for the amino acids in both molecules shown to be important for ligand binding. The production and purification of the ICAM-1-IgG fusion protein, as well as the K39A andK39E ICAM-1 mutants, has previously been described (31Fisher K.L. Lu J. Riddle L. Kim K.J. Presta L.G. Bodary S.C. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1997; 8: 501-515Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). We have established the convention that the ICAM amino acids will be underlined. ICAM-2-IgG fusion protein was generated in a similar fashion. Briefly, cDNA was made from U937 RNA. Using PCR and forward (5′-GTCAGTATCGATTGGAGACTGCCAGAGATGTC-3′) and reverse (5′-AAAGTCGGTGACCTGCTGGCTGTCCGACACAGGCTC-3′) primers, a fragment containing the extracellular domain of ICAM-2 was generated from that cDNA. At the 5′-end of the forward primer, a ClaI site was placed and at the 5′-end of the reverse primer, a BstEII site was placed. Using the plasmid containing the human interferon-γ receptor extracellular domain (ECD)-human Ig fusion protein construct (32Marsters S.A. Pennica D. Bach E. Schreiber R.D. Ashkenazi A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 5401-5405Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar), the interferon-γ receptor ECD was replaced with the ICAM-2 ECD at the ClaI and BstEII sites. The entire ICAM-2 ECD was sequenced to assure fidelity. The plasmid was stably transfected into human 293 cells and secreted ICAM-2-IgG was purified using protein A affinity chromatography. The I-domain mutants were generated using a plasmid containing the sequence encoding amino acids 115–411 of human CD11a and in which the first PflMI site 3′ of the I-domain had been abolished (pLFA.ID.Δp). A series of oligonucleotides were synthesized to incorporate the indicated base pair substitutions within the I-domain. Then, using oligonucleotide-directed mutagenesis (33Kunkel T.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1985; 82: 488-492Crossref PubMed Scopus (4903) Google Scholar), the indicated I-domain mutations were incorporated into the pLFA.ID.Δp plasmid. The entire sequence from the NarI site to the remainingPflMI site for each construct was sequenced to ensure the accuracy of each mutant. The mutant I-domains were then inserted into the human CD11a plasmid (pRKLFAαm) at the comparable NarI and PflMI sites. Human 293 cells were transfected by a standard calcium phosphate method as described previously (34Gorman C.M. Gies D.R. McCray G. DNA Protein Eng. Tech. 1990; 2: 3-10Google Scholar). Briefly, 1 day prior to transfection, 293 cells were seeded at 30–40% confluence in 10-cm plates and incubated overnight. For each condition, 10 μg of pRKCD18 (35Berman P.W. Nakamura G.R. Riddle L.

DNA Protein Eng. Tech. 1990; 2: 3-10Google Scholar), and 10 μg of the plasmid containing the specified CD11a constructs were precipitated in CaCl2 and HEPES buffer and added to the plates. Mock-transfected cells were transfected with only the pAdvRNA construct. The cells were incubated with the DNA for 3–4 h, shocked with 15% glycerol in PBS for 45 s, and then placed in fresh media. After 3 days, transfectants were tested for 1) adhesion to ICAM-1-IgG or ICAM-2-IgG that had been captured by anti-human Fc antibody (Caltag, Burlingame, CA), or 2) expression of the CD11a/CD18 complexes on the cell surface using FACS analysis. 200 ng of goat anti-human Fc (Caltag) in PBS was added to each well of Nunc Maxisorb 96-well plates and incubated overnight at 4 °C. Plates were washed with PBS and blocked with 1% bovine serum albumin/PBS solution for 1 h at room temperature. The plates were washed, and 50 μl of a 1–2 μg/ml solution of ICAM-1-IgG or ICAM-2-IgG was added to the wells and incubated at 37 °C for 1–2 h. The plates were washed, and 50 μl of cells was added per well, in triplicate determinations for each condition. Each experiment testing for ICAM-1 adhesion was carried out at least three times and at least twice for ICAM-2. Transfected cells were detached with 5 mm EDTA/PBS and resuspended at a concentration of 200,000 cells/50 μl of adhesion buffer (140 mm NaCl, 20 mm HEPES, pH 7.5, 0.2% glucose) containing 1 mm each of MgCl2 and CaCl2 and 5 μg/ml of the anti-CD18 activation antibody MEM-48 (R & D Systems, Abingdon, United Kingdom) (1Binnerts M.E. van Kooyk Y. Simmons D.L. Figdor C.G. Eur. J. Immunol. 1994; 24: 2155-2160Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). FACS analysis determined that the I-domain mutants bound MEM-48 at levels comparable to CD11a/CD18 under these conditions. The cells were added to the plates and incubated at 37 °C for 1.5 h. Nonadherent cells were removed by three washes with PBS. Cell attachment was measured using theP-nitrophenyl-N-acetyl-β-d-glucosaminide method of Landegren (36Landegren U. J. Immunol. Methods. 1984; 57: 379-388Crossref Scopus (603) Google Scholar). The wild-type LFA-1 expressing cells bound ligand on average at levels approximately 10 times higher than mock-transfected cells. On average, 50% of the total wild-type LFA-1 expressing cells added per well bound the coated ligand. Three days posttransfection, cells were detached, and 500,000 cells were resuspended in 100 μl of adhesion buffer containing 1 mmeach of MgCl2 and CaCl2 and antibodies against either CD11a or CD18. Monoclonal antibodies against CD11a were used at 1 μg/ml, for purified MHM-24 (37Hildreth J.E.K. Gotch F.M. Hildreth P.D.K. McMichael A.J. Eur. J.

Monoclonal antibodies against CD18 were used at 5 μg/ml for MEM-48 (R & D Systems), or 1 μg/ml for MHM-23 (37Hildreth J.E.K. Gotch F.M. Hildreth P.D.K. McMichael A.J. Eur. J.

Cells were incubated with antibodies on ice for 1 h and washed, and fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated goat anti-mouse antibodies (Cappel, Westchester, PA) were added at a dilution of 1:500. Cells were washed, fixed in 1% formaldehyde, and analyzed by FACS analysis using the CELLQuest software (Becton Dickinson). Transfection efficiencies and antibody binding levels were calculated as the percentage of the number of mutant expressing cells that bound to a given antibody compared with the number of wild-type LFA-1 expressing cells that bound to the same antibody. We have found that this provides a good estimation of transfection efficiency for our experiments, and in no instance did the relative mean fluorescence intensity differ significantly from the relative percentage of antibody binding positive cells. Typical transfection efficiencies ranged from 30 to 80%. A panel of 35 mutants of the LFA-1 I-domain were generated and subdivided into two classes. The first class of mutants was a series of alanine scans in which clusters of charged amino acids in the I-domain were changed to alanines. These mutants, designated hImp-1 through hImp-13, are depicted in Fig. 1. Asp-137, which was mutated in our previous work, was not changed (40Edwards C.P. Champe M. Gonzalez T. Wessinger M.E.

The second class of mutants was a series of 21 point mutants in which the single amino acids were mutated to alanine (Fig. 1 and Table I, B). The nomenclature for these point mutants identifies the wild-type amino acid, its position within the polypeptide, and the amino acid substitution. Twelve of these point mutants correspond to charged residues contained within hImp-2, -8, -10, and -12 sequences, and 9 were novel mutants of uncharged amino acids.Table IBinding of I-domain mutants to ICAM-1 and ICAM-2Cells expressing wild-type and mutant LFA-1 were assayed for binding to ICAM-1 and ICAM-2 coated plates.

Each condition was carried out in triplicate. In each experiment, cells transfected with cDNAs encoding the mutants were assayed for their ability to bind to a panel of antibodies against LFA-1 using FACS (Table II). Three antibodies that recognize CD18 and nine antibodies that recognize CD11a were used. Of the anti-CD18 antibodies, two recognize the CD18 subunit alone (H52 and MEM-48) and one recognizes CD18 (MHM-23) when complexed with an α-chain (39Hildreth J.E.K. August J.T. J. Immunol. 1985; 134: 3272-3280PubMed Google Scholar). 3P. Berman and G. Nakamura, unpublished observation. Of the anti-CD11a antibodies, seven recognize epitopes within the I-domain (25.3, TS1/22, 32E6, 50G1, MHM-24, and MEM-83, 38), and two recognize epitopes outside the I-domain (3D6, L16). Six of the seven anti-CD11a antibodies have been mapped to four different epitopes, Ide A, B, C, and D (16Champe M. McIntyre B.W. Berman P.W. J. Biol.

The antibodies that map to Ide A, B, and C are function-blocking antibodies and block the interaction of LFA-1 with ICAM-1, -2, and -3.

ND (not determined) indicates that a particular antibody was not tested for binding to a particular mutant. Wild-type and mutant CD11a constructs were co-transfected with the cDNA for CD18, and cells were assayed for their ability to bind to ICAM-1 (Fig. 2 and Table I) and the panel of antibodies against LFA-1 (Table II). The hImp mutants were examined first (Fig. 2). Based on antibody binding and adhesion to ICAM-1, the mutants were subdivided into three groups. The first group is represented by hImp-3, -5, -6, -10, and -11. Cells expressing these mutants bound ICAM-1 and a majority of the antibodies at levels similar to wild-type LFA-1 transfectants. The second group of mutants is represented by hImp-1, -4, -7, and -9. These mutants appear to have major structural perturbations in LFA-1 because binding of all antibodies was abolished or reduced to less than 60% of wild-type binding. The last class of mutants is represented by hImp-2, -8, -12, and -13. Cells expressing these mutants had reduced or no binding to ICAM-1 but showed robust binding to the panel of anti-CD18 and anti-CD11a antibodies. The amino acids making up this last class of hImp mutants are likely to play a key role in ICAM-1 binding. Our strategy in generating point mutants was 2-fold. First, the hImp mutants that were found to express structurally intact LFA-1 and also abrogate ICAM-1 binding were further dissected. Second, the region adjacent to the cation binding site of the CD11a and CD11b I-domains has been suggested as important for contacting ligand (27Qu A. Leahy D.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Arnaout M.A. Cell. 1993; 72: 857-867Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (318) Google Scholar), and amino acids that mapped to this region were mutated. Within the hImp mutants, we mutated the following charged amino acids to alanine: Asp-145 and Glu-146 in hImp-2, Glu-241 in hImp-8, and Lys-287, Asp-290, Glu-293, and Lys-294 in hImp-12. We did not mutate individual amino acids within hImp-13, because it is not located on or close to the cation binding domain. In addition, a second group of point mutants were generated in which uncharged amino acids near the cation binding region were mutated to alanine. These residues are Met-140, Gln-143, Thr-175, Leu-205, Thr-243, Ser-245, Gln-266, Thr-267, and Thr-273. Of these 16 point mutants, L205A, E241A, and T243A completely abolished binding to ICAM-1. E146A reduced binding to ICAM-1 by 70% compared with wild-type LFA-1 (Table I, B). Three mutants, T175A, H264A, and E293A, had moderate effects on LFA-1 binding to ICAM-1, reducing binding by 40% compared with wild-type LFA-1. L205A, E241A, T243A, E146A, T175A, and E293A bound to the panel of antibodies as well as wild-type LFA-1, whereas H264A showed a moderate decrease in binding to TS1/22 (Table II). Unexpectedly, when the hImp-12 mutant, which abolished binding of LFA-1 expressing cells to ICAM-1, was dissected into point mutants (K287A, D290A, E293A, and K294A), none of these mutants abrogated binding. As mentioned, the E293A mutant did show an approximately 40% reduction in binding. This suggests that more than one amino acid from the hImp-12 mutant must be simultaneously mutated in order to generate the hlmp-12 phenotype. The structure of the extracellular domain of ICAM-2 has been solved (43Casasnovas J.M. Springer T.A. Liu J. Harrison S.C. Wang J. Nature. 1997; 387: 312-315Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar). The three-dimensional structure of the first domain of ICAM-2 shows a high degree of similarity to the predicted three-dimensional structure of the first domain of ICAM-1 (31Fisher K.L. Lu J. Riddle L. Kim K.J. Presta L.G. Bodary S.C. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1997; 8: 501-515Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). Therefore, we determined whether the amino acids in the LFA-1 I-domain important for ICAM-1 binding were also important for ICAM-2 binding. All mutants that abolished or reduced binding to ICAM-1 also abolished or reduced binding to ICAM-2 (Table I). In addition, the hImp-10 mutant preferentially abrogate"

Na+/K+-ATPase is an integral membrane protein that transports sodium and potassium ions against an electrochemical gradient. The transport of Na+ and K+ ions is presumably connected to an oscillation of the enzyme between two major conformational states, namely the E1Na+ and the E2K+conformations. The E1 and E2 states have different affinities for ATP. The pumping mechanism may be described by conformational changes of a single ATP site of the catalytic α-subunit between a high affinity E1ATP1 site (from where Na+ export starts by phosphorylation) and a low affinity E2ATP site (which is involved in K+import) (1Skou J.C.

The amino acid sequence forming the high affinity E1ATP site has been defined by affinity labeling with protein-reactive ATP derivatives and by specific labeling with the pseudo-ATP analog FITC (25Ohta T.

Information on the location of the low affinity E2ATP binding site may be obtained by similar means, i.e. affinity labeling followed by amino acid sequencing and by energy transfer experiments after specific modification of the E1ATP site by a fluorophor. Affinity labeling of the low affinity E2ATP site needs the availability of specific ATP derivatives as probes (4Thoenges D. Schoner W. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 16315-16321Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). Since many derivatives of fluorescein (pyrene, eosin, or erythrosin) bind to the E1ATP site as well (32Skou J.C. Esmann M. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1980; 601: 386-402Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar, 33Skou J.C. Esmann M. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1981; 647: 232-240Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar, 34Amler E. Abbott A.

Biochem. 1998; 251: 522-527Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar), the possibility arose that fluorescent pseudo-ATP derivatives may exist that label the E2ATP site as well. Provided specific labeling of the E2ATP binding site by a fluorescent pseudo-ATP derivative can be achieved, Förster energy transfer measurements may give information on the distance of this E2ATP site to the E1ATP site, since the latter can be labeled specifically by FITC at Lys501 (26Kirley T.L.

Hence, information may be obtained from the availability of such a system on the question as to whether both ATP binding sites are close or distant from each other. This paper shows that a pseudo-ATP binding for the E2ATP site exists. Erythrosin 5′-isothiocyanate (ErITC) inactivates the residual K+-activated phosphatase (an activity of the E2ATP site) in an enzyme whose E1ATP had already been blocked by labeling with FITC. Energy transfer from the E1ATP-labeled fluorescein to the E2ATP-labeled erythrosin (as well to the Co2+ ions sitting in the E2ATP site) was so low that it is unlikely that both ATP sites reside on the same catalytic α-subunit. All chemicals were of the highest purity available and were obtained from Bio-Rad, Boehringer Mannheim, Merck, and Molecular Probes (Eugene, OR). Lab-Trol protein standard is a product of Merz & Dade (Munich, Germany). [γ-32P]ATP was from Amersham Pharmacia Biotech. Calculation and presentation of data were performed with the program Graph-Pad-Prism 2.01 (Graph Pad Software Inc., San Diego, CA). The synthesis of Cr(H2O)4ATP, Cr(H2O)4AdoPP[CH2]P, and Co(NH3)4ATP was performed by the aniline method of Cleland et al. (37Cleland W.W. Methods Enzymol. 1982; 87: 159-179Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar) with the variations described earlier (22Schoner W. Thönges D. Hamer E. Antolovic R. Buxbaum E. Willeke M. Serpersu E.H.

Na+/K+-ATPase from pig kidney with a specific enzymatic activity of 25–27 units/mg of protein was isolated by a modification of Jørgensen's procedure (38Jørgensen P.L. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1974; 356: 36-52Crossref PubMed Scopus (773) Google Scholar) and measured by coupled spectrophotometric assay (39Schoner W. von Ilberg C. Kramer R. Seubert W. Eur. J. Biochem. 1967; 1: 334-343Crossref PubMed Scopus (246) Google Scholar). One enzyme unit is defined as the amount of enzyme hydrolyzing 1 μmol of ATP/min at 37 °C. Protein was determined by the method of Lowry et al. (40Lowry O.H. Rosebrough N.J. Farr A.L. Randall R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1951; 193: 265-275Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) using Lab-Trol as the protein standard. Lab-Trol is a mixture of proteins and enzymes used for the calibration of assays in clinical chemical analysis. All buffers used were made up to their respective pH value at room temperature. K+-activated p-nitrophenylphosphatase activity was measured on a multititer plate by incubating Na+/K+-ATPase at 37 °C in a total volume of 150 μl containing 61 mm Tris/HCl (pH 7.25), 6.4 mm MgCl2, 12 mm KCl, and 5 mm p-nitrophenylphosphate. The reaction was stopped after 15 min by the addition of 200 μl of 3 n NaOH. Thep-nitrophenolate formed was measured at 405 nm by an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay reader (8Linnertz H. Thönges D. Schoner W. Eur. J. Biochem. 1995; 232: 420-424Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). Na+/K+-ATPase at a final concentration of 1 unit/ml (65 μg/ml) was incubated overnight at 37 °C in a solution containing 20 mm Tris/HCl (pH 7.25), 15 mm NaCl, and 10 μm FITC. The inactivated enzyme was sedimented in Eppendorf tubes at 100,000 ×g in a 50Ti rotor using adapters of our own design. The pellet was resuspended in 1 ml of 20 mm Tris/HCl (pH 7.25), and the Na+/K+-ATPase activity (39Schoner W. von Ilberg C. Kramer R. Seubert W. Eur. J. Biochem. 1967; 1: 334-343Crossref PubMed Scopus (246) Google Scholar) was determined. The residual activity was less than 5% initial activity. Na+/K+-ATPase was inactivated with varying concentrations of ErITC as follows. 1 unit of Na+/K+-ATPase was incubated in a total volume of 1 ml with ErITC (0–1 mm) in 20 mm Tris/HCl (pH 7.25) and 15 mm NaCl at 37 °C. The residual Na+/K+-ATPase activity was assayed by transferring aliquots of 50 μl to the optical assay (39Schoner W. von Ilberg C. Kramer R. Seubert W. Eur. J. Biochem. 1967; 1: 334-343Crossref PubMed Scopus (246) Google Scholar). To detect whether ErITC binds to the ATP site, the enzyme was inactivated with 200 nm ErITC in the presence of 0, 2.5, or 25 mm Na2ATP (adjusted to pH 7.25 with Tris base). The inactivation constant K i was calculated according to Piszkiewics and Smith (41Piszkiewics D. Smith E.L. Biochemistry. 1971; 10: 4544-4552Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). FITC is a covalent label for the high affinity E1ATP binding site of Na+/K+-ATPase that leaves the activity of the E2ATP site almost unaffected (8Linnertz H. Thönges D. Schoner W. Eur. J. Biochem. 1995; 232: 420-424Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar, 11Buxbaum E. Schoner W. Eur. J. Biochem. 1991; 195: 407-419Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar, 25Ohta T. Nagano K.

Biomembr. 1980; 12: 111-136Crossref PubMed Scopus (235) Google Scholar). Therefore, the effects of ErITC on K+-activatedp-nitrophenylphosphatase, an activity of the low affinity E2ATP site, were tested in the following way. Na+/K+-ATPase at a final concentration of 1 unit/ml (65 μg/ml) was incubated overnight at 37 °C in a solution containing 20 mm Tris/HCl (pH 7.25) and 10 μmFITC. A control enzyme was treated in the same way but without FITC. This control was set at 100%. The inactivated enzyme (residual Na+/K+-ATPase activity of 1%) was spun down in Eppendorf tubes at 100,000 × g. The pellet was washed in 20 mm Tris/HCl (pH 7.25) and resuspended in a solution of 20 mm Tris/HCl (pH 7.25), 15 mm NaCl, and various concentrations (0–10 μm) of ErITC. After incubation for 15 min at 37 °C, the K+-activatedp-nitrophenylphosphatase activity was estimated. Co(NH3)4ATP is a specific inhibitor of the E2ATP site of Na+/K+-ATPase (9Scheiner-Bobis G. Fahlbusch K. Schoner W. Eur. J. Biochem. 1987; 168: 123-131Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar, 22Schoner W. Thönges D. Hamer E. Antolovic R. Buxbaum E. Willeke M. Serpersu E.H. Scheiner-Bobis G. Bamberg E. Schoner W. The Sodium Pump. Steinkopff, Darmstadt, Germany1994: 332-341Crossref Google Scholar). It was used, therefore, to detect interferences of ErITC with this site. Na+/K+-ATPase at a final concentration of 2.5 units/ml (163 μg/ml) was incubated overnight at 37 °C in a solution containing 20 mm Tris/HCl (pH 7.25), 15 mm NaCl, and 10 μm FITC. The enzyme was spun down at 100,000 × g, and washed with 20 mmTris/HCl (pH 7.25), and resuspended in 20 mm Tris/HCl (pH 7.25), 15 mm NaCl, and 1 mmCo(NH3)4ATP (the control contained no Co(NH3)4ATP). After a 1-h incubation at 37 °C, the enzyme was spun down and washed again. After incubation at 37 °C for 1 additional h in a solution containing 20 mm Tris/HCl, 15 mm NaCl, and different concentrations of ErITC (0–1 μm), the enzyme was spun down at 100,000 × g and washed three times with 20 mm Tris/HCl (pH 7.25). The fluorescence of ErITC was detected in a Hitachi F-3000 spectrofluorometer at λex530 nm and λem 555 nm. A probe labeled with FITC served as control. Co(NH3)4PO4 is an inhibitor of the E2ATP site (11Buxbaum E. Schoner W. Eur. J. Biochem. 1991; 195: 407-419Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar, 12Buxbaum E. Schoner W. Eur. J. Biochem. 1990; 193: 355-360Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar), and Na+-dependent phosphorylation (front-door phosphorylation) detects an activity of the E1ATP site (1Skou J.C. Esmann M. J. Bioenerg. Biomembr. 1992; 24: 249-261PubMed Google Scholar,4Thoenges D. Schoner W. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 16315-16321Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar, 21Askari A. Prog. Clin. Biol. Res. 1988; 268: 149-165Google Scholar). Interference by ErITC of the E1ATP site can be detected from the change of the Na+-dependent phosphorylation of Na+/K+-ATPase by the chosen isothiocyanate in an enzyme whose E2ATP site had been blocked with Co(NH3)4PO4. Na+/K+-ATPase at a final concentration of 1 units/ml (65 μg/ml) was incubated overnight at 37 °C in a solution containing 20 mm Tris/HCl (pH 7.25) and 50 mmCo(NH3)4PO4 (a control without Co(NH3)4PO4 was run in parallel). The inactivated enzyme was sedimented at 100,000 × g, washed in 20 mm Tris/HCl (pH 7.25), and incubated in 20 mm Tris/HCl, 15 mm NaCl, and 2 μmErITC. After different incubation times at 37 °C, the enzyme was spun down and washed twice with 20 mm Tris/HCl (pH 7.25), and front-door phosphorylation was measured as follows. The enzyme in 100 mm NaCl, 1 mm MgCl2, and 10 mm imidazole/HCl (pH 7.25) was placed on ice. The reaction was started by the addition of 100 μl of 1 mm[γ-32P]ATP (200 cpm/pmol) so that the final concentration was 0.1 mm. The reaction was stopped after 1 min by the addition of 250 μl of 25% trichloroacetic acid, 10 mm Na2HPO4, and 1 mmunlabeled ATP. The mixture was centrifuged at 100,000 ×g for 30 min. The pellet was washed three times with 500 μl of 5% trichloroacetic acid containing 2 mmNa2HPO4 and 0.2 mm unlabeled ATP. Background labeling of 1 unit of Na+/K+-ATPase that was quenched first with 250 μl of 25% trichloroacetic acid prior to the addition of the phosphorylation mixture was subtracted from all samples. Na+/K+-ATPase (6 units, 300 μg) was incubated in a total volume of 1 ml overnight at 37 °C in a solution containing 20 mm Tris/HCl (pH 7.25), 15 mm NaCl, and 10 μm FITC (a control contained no FITC). This inactivated enzyme was centrifuged in Eppendorf tubes at 100,000 × g. The pellet was resuspended in 1 ml of a solution containing 20 mm Tris/HCl (pH 7.25), 15 mm KCl, and 2 μm ErITC or 1 mmCo(NH3)4ATP. This preparation was incubated additionally for 3 h at 37 °C, centrifuged, and washed twice in 20 mm Tris/HCl (pH 7.25). After the last centrifugation step, the protein was resuspended in 0.3 ml of 20 mmTris/HCl buffer (pH 7.25) (final concentration 1.8 mg/ml). All lifetime measurements of FITC-labeled Na+/K+-ATPase were performed in the presence of 5 μg/ml antifluorescein antibodies to correct for contributions by free and nonspecifically attached FITC molecules (34Amler E. Abbott A. Ball W.J. Biophys. J. 1992; 61: 553-568Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). To study the effects on the individual α-subunit, the labeled enzyme was solubilized by incubation with 5% SDS at 37 °C for 15 min to break any protein-protein interactions of the α-subunits. The energy transfer was measured in the presence of SDS in the same way. Specific binding of the ouabain derivatives anthroylouabain (AO) and FEDO to Na+/K+-ATPase proceeded under conditions of backdoor phosphorylation (8Linnertz H. Thönges D. Schoner W. Eur. J. Biochem. 1995; 232: 420-424Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar, 42Brinkmann K. Linnertz H. Amler E. Lanz E. Herman P. Schoner W. Eur. J. Biochem. 1997; 249: 301-308Crossref PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar). Na+/K+-ATPase (6 units) was incubated in 200 mm imidazole/HCl buffer (pH 7.25), 3 mmMgCl2, 10 mm imidazole/phosphate (pH 7.25), and 150 nm AO for 1 h at 37 °C. To prepare the sample labeled with donor (AO) and acceptor (FEDO), the enzyme was incubated under the same conditions but in the presence of 150 nm AO and 300 nm FEDO. This concentration was used because the affinity of Na+/K+-ATPase for AO was twice as high as that for FEDO (42Brinkmann K. Linnertz H. Amler E. Lanz E. Herman P. Schoner W. Eur. J. Biochem. 1997; 249: 301-308Crossref PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar). A Specol 211 spectrophotometer was used for absorbance measurements. Steady-state fluorescence data were collected in quartz cuvettes on a Perkin-Elmer LS-5 fluorometer equipped with monochromators (34Amler E. Abbott A. Ball W.J. Biophys. J. 1992; 61: 553-568Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). Excitation and emission wavelengths were 500 and 520 nm, respectively, for FITC and FEDO, 362 and 471 nm for AO, and 530 and 555 nm for ErITC, respectively. Two Glan-Thompson polarizers were used for determination of the steady-state anisotropy values. All measurements were performed at 25 °C. The molar ratio of bound fluorophores per α-subunit was determined from steady-state fluorescence measurements based on the known quantum yield of standards of known concentrations. Quantum yield of bound FITC was compared with free FITC in ethanol, and bound ErITC was compared with free ErITC in water. Although the former increases about 10%, the quantum yield of the latter increases four times (34Amler E. Abbott A. Ball W.J. Biophys. J. 1992; 61: 553-568Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). For the determination of the molar FITC/ErITC ratio per mol of α-subunit, we labeled Na+/K+-ATPase at a specific activity of 25–27 units/mg of protein first with 10 μm FITC at pH 7.25 and subsequently with 2 μm ErITC (as described above). Steady-state fluorescence of the protein-bound fluorescein was corrected for unspecific fluorescence (outside the E1ATP binding site) by the addition of 5 μg/ml antifluorescein antibodies (34Amler E. Abbott A. Ball W.J. Biophys. J. 1992; 61: 553-568Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). The molar concentration of Na+/K+-ATPase and its α-subunit was calculated from the protein concentration using the molecular weight of 113 kDa for the α- and 55 kDa for the β-subunit (3Lingrel J.B Kuntzweiler T. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 19659-19662Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The samples were measured in a total volume of 600 μl at a final protein concentration of 1.8 mg/ml. The apparatus for lifetime measurements was based on a laser excitation source and on time-correlated single photon counting as the detection system. The excitation source consisted of a cavity-dumped dye laser (model 375, Spectra Physics, Mountain View, CA) synchronously pumped by the argon ion laser (model 171, Spectra Physics) and a frequency doubler. The excitation pulses (full width at half maximum about 10 ps) were generated at 356 nm with pyridine 1 as the laser dye. The required emission wavelength was selected by a monochromator with a proper cut-off filter in front of the input slit. The fluorescence decays were measured with the emission polarizer oriented at the “magic angle” of 54.7 degrees to the direction of the excitation polarization vector. The response function of the apparatus was determined by the REF procedure of Vecer (43Vecer J. Kowalczyk A.A. Davenport L. Dale R.E. Rev. Sci. Instrum. 1993; 64: 3413-3422Crossref Scopus (26) Google Scholar) with FITC and potassium iodide-quenched FITC as reference compounds. In the case of AO as fluorescence donor, 1,4-bis[2-(5-phenyloxazolyl)]benzene was used as the reference compound. All experiments were repeated with an unlabeled sample to correct for the fluorescence background and light scattering. The decay data were analyzed by a nonlinear least squares deconvolution procedure. The fit quality was evaluated from the randomness of the residual plot and the autocorrelation function together with the χR2 value. Distances (R) between donor and acceptor pairs were derived from the apparent efficiencies of Förster energy transfer (E), which was calculated from the quenching of the steady-state fluorescence intensity of the donor or from the decrease of donor lifetime (τD, presence of donor only; τDA, presence of donor and acceptor). The apparent efficiency of energy transfer is related to the absolute rate of energy transfer (k T) as shown below.E=kTτD/1+kTτD=1−τDA/τD(Eq. 1) This rate has been defined by Förster (44Förster T. Fluoreszenz Organischer Verbindungen. Vandehoeck & Ruprecht, Göttingen, Germany1951: 67Google Scholar) askT=(ΦDJκ2/τDn4R6)×8.7×1023 s−1,(Eq. 2) where ΦD is the quantum yield of the donor in the absence of acceptor, n is the refractive index of the solution, R is the distance between donor and acceptor (in cm), J is the spectral overlap integral (cm3/m) defined asJ=∫FDλex,λεA(λ)λ4dλ∫FDλex,λdλ,(Eq. 3) where εA(λ) is the extinction coefficient of the acceptor, and F D(λex,λ) is the fluorescence of the donor (excited at λex) that is emitted at wavelength λ. Finally, κ2 is the orientation factor of the donor, which is defined asκ2=(sinα sinβ cosP−2cosα cosβ)2,(Eq. 4) and α and β are, respectively, the angles that the emission dipole of the donor and the absorption dipole acceptor's form with vector R. Vector R connects these two dipoles.P is then the angle between the planes that contain α and β. The resulting Förster critical distance (R 0), which is the distance in the case of E = 0.5, isR06=8.7×1023ΦDJκ2/n4.(Eq. 5) Labeling of the enzyme used in this work (pH at 7.25) resulted in the donor and acceptor anisotropy values low enough to take the orientational factor κ2 for the mutual distance calculations as 2/3, assuming random mutual orientation of fluorophores (45Dale R.E. Eissinger J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1976; 73: 271-273Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). For determination of the overlap integral (J), the values of ε and ΦD were taken from Amler et al.(34Amler E. Abbott A. Ball W.J. Biophys.

Following copper addition, Rpr protein was detected at 1.5 h and maximal at 2.5 h. Ceramide generation and caspase activation occurred nearly simultaneously, each detectable at 2–2.5 h and maximal at 6 h. Ceramide levels increased from a base line of 5 pmol/nmol lipid phosphorus to a maximum of 10 pmol/nmol lipid phosphorus. Identical increases in ceramide were detected using the enzymatic 1,2-diacylglycerol kinase assay or the non-enzymatico-phthalaldehyde derivatization high pressure liquid chromatography assay. In contrast, diacylglycerol levels were not increased by Rpr expression. Apoptosis, first detected at 4 h, was maximal at 16 h. Co-expression of p35 did not affect Rpr-induced ceramide generation, whereas caspase activation and apoptosis were abolished. In contrast, zVAD.fmk inhibited ceramide generation and apoptosis.

Apoptosis results from activation of a preprogrammed pathway of biochemical events that lead to cell death. One of the first genes to be identified from Drosophila as involved in apoptosis is the Reaper (Rpr)1 gene, which encodes a 65-amino acid protein. Deletion of a genomic region that contains the Rpr gene as well as two other pro-apoptotic genes, Grim and Head Involution Defective, blocked virtually all apoptosis that normally occurs during Drosophila embryogenesis (1White K.

Science. 1996; 271: 805-807Crossref PubMed Scopus (336) Google Scholar, 5Nordstrom W. Chen P. Steller H. Abrams J.M. Dev.

The mechanism by which Rpr induces apoptosis is still unclear. Rpr is hypothesized to be a death-inducing signal, as opposed to being part of the death effector machinery. It has been suggested that Rpr is the Drosophilahomolog of the death domains of the human APO-1/Fas/CD95 and p55 tumor necrosis factor receptors (7Golstein P. Marguet D. Depraetere V. Cell. 1995; 81: 185-186Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar), but this hypothesis was not supported by two mutagenesis studies on Rpr (8Chen P. Lee P. Otto L. Abrams J. J. Biol.

Biol. 1997; 17: 667-676Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar).The lipid molecule, ceramide, forms the backbone of all sphingolipids, including sphingomyelin and glycosphingolipids. Sphingomyelin hydrolysis by sphingomyelinases is induced in response to diverse stimuli, generating the second messenger ceramide. Such stimuli include the cytokines tumor necrosis factor-α, interleukin-1β, and nerve growth factor, ligands for the CD95 and CD28 receptors, and cellular stresses such as ionizing radiation and ultraviolet light, to list a few (10Jarvis W.D. Grant S. Kolesnick R.N. Clin. Cancer Res. 1996; 2: 1-6PubMed Google Scholar, 11Hannun Y.A. Science. 1996; 274: 1855-1859Crossref PubMed Scopus (1487) Google Scholar, 12Spiegel S. Foster D.A. Kolesnick R.N. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1996; 8: 159-167Crossref PubMed Scopus (471) Google Scholar). A second pathway for ceramide generation involving the enzyme ceramide synthase is activated by the chemotherapeutic agent, daunorubicin (13Bose R. Verheij M. Haimovitz-Friedman A. Scotto K. Fuks Z. Kolesnick R. Cell. 1995; 82: 405-414Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (782) Google Scholar). A number of direct targets for ceramide action have been identified, including a ceramide-activated protein kinase (14Liu J. Mathias S. Yang Z. Kolesnick R.N. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 3047-3052Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar,15Zhang Y. Yao B. Delikat S. Bayoumy S. Lin X.-H. Basu S. Chan-Hui P.-Y. Lichenstein H. Kolesnick R.

Ceramide also indirectly activates signaling cascades involving stress-activated protein kinase/Jun N-terminal kinase (18Verheij M. Bose R. Lin X.H. Yao B. Jarvis W.D. Grant S. Birrer M.J. Szabo E.

Lang F. Gulbins E. J. Biol.

Chem. 1993; 268: 14572-14575Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Ceramide signals apoptosis, differentiation, or growth arrest, depending on the cell type and context in which ceramide is generated. In this regard, ceramide is generated during the induction of apoptosis in a wide variety of cellular systems (10Jarvis W.D. Grant S. Kolesnick R.N. Clin. Cancer Res. 1996; 2: 1-6PubMed Google Scholar, 21Pena L.A. Fuks Z. Kolesnick R. Biochem. Pharmacol. 1997; 53: 615-621Crossref PubMed Scopus (218) Google Scholar). Addition of cell-permeable ceramide analogs, but not analogs of other lipid second messengers, induces apoptosis in many of these cell lines, providing evidence that ceramide generation plays a direct role in the apoptotic response. Furthermore, genetic models of sphingomyelinase deficiency that lack ceramide generation display reductions in apoptosis upon exposure to stress. Cells from patients with Niemann-Pick disease fail to respond to ionizing radiation with ceramide generation or apoptosis, and retroviral transfer of the acid sphingomyelinase gene restores both events (22Santana P. Pena L.A. Haimovitz-Friedman A. Martin S. Green D. McLoughlin M. Cordon-Cardo C. Schuchman E.H. Fuks Z. Kolesnick R. Cell. 1996; 86: 189-199Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (722) Google Scholar). Similarly, acid sphingomyelinase knock-out mice present a deficit in radiation-induced ceramide generation and endothelial apoptosis in the lung but no defect in p53-mediated death of thymocytes (22Santana P. Pena L.A. Haimovitz-Friedman A. Martin S. Green D. McLoughlin M. Cordon-Cardo C. Schuchman E.H. Fuks Z. Kolesnick R. Cell. 1996; 86: 189-199Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (722) Google Scholar). Additional support for a requirement for ceramide generation is derived from studies using daunorubicin in P388 lymphoma cells. In this system, daunorubicin induces prolonged ceramide generation by activation of ceramide synthase, and the mycotoxin fumonisin B1, a specific inhibitor of ceramide synthase, blocks ceramide generation and apoptosis (13Bose R. Verheij M. Haimovitz-Friedman A. Scotto K. Fuks Z. Kolesnick R. Cell. 1995; 82: 405-414Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (782) Google Scholar). Fumonisin B1 also abrogated daunorubicin-induced apoptosis in hen granulosa cells (23Witty J.P. Bridgham J.T. Johnson A.L. Endocrinology. 1996; 137: 5269-5277Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar) and CPT-11-induced apoptosis in L929 cells (24Suzuki A. Iwasaki M. Kato M. Wagai N. Exp. Cell Res. 1997; 233: 41-47Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). In sum, ceramide appears to be a generic signal for the apoptotic response.Caspases are a family of cysteine proteases, formerly known as the ICE/Ced-3 family, that specifically cleave proteins after aspartate residues. The critical role of caspases in apoptosis was first demonstrated by the isolation of the ced-3 gene by genetic screens for cell death-defective mutants in Caenorhabditis elegans (25Yuan J. Shaham S. Ledoux S. Ellis H.M. Horvitz H.R. Cell. 1993; 75: 641-652Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2233) Google Scholar). An abundance of evidence supports the notion that caspases are the effectors of apoptosis in mammalian systems. Currently, at least 10 mammalian caspases and 2 Drosophilacaspases have been cloned (26Martin S.J. Green D.R. Cell. 1995; 82: 342-352Abstract Full Text PDF Scopus (1258) Google Scholar, 27Villa P.

Physiologic caspase inhibitors, such as the cowpox virus CrmA protein and the baculovirus p35 protein, and peptide caspase inhibitors designed to compete for the substrate recognition site (27Villa P.

Sci. 1997; 22: 388-393Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (550) Google Scholar) have been used effectively to block stress-induced apoptosis.Numerous studies have addressed the role of caspases in ceramide-induced apoptosis. Ceramide has been reported to function upstream of caspase-3 or caspase-3-like proteases during induction of apoptosis (31Tepper A.D. Boesen-de Cock G.R. de Vries E. Borst J. van Blitterswijk W.J. J.

In Drosophila, it was reported that ceramide functions downstream of caspases during Rpr-induced apoptosis on the basis of the effects of the tripeptide caspase inhibitorN-benzyloxycarbonyl-VAD-fluoromethylketone (zVAD.fmk) (6Pronk G.J. Ramer K. Amiri P. Williams L.T. Science. 1996; 271: 808-810Crossref PubMed Scopus (258) Google Scholar). In the present study, we re-examined this result using cells transfected with the baculovirus p35 protein under the control of a metallothionein promoter. We demonstrate that ceramide is generated in SL2 cells rapidly following induction of the Rpr gene. Ceramide generation and caspase activation are nearly simultaneous and precede apoptosis. Cells co-expressing Rpr and p35 manifest a ceramide rise despite blockade of caspase activation and apoptosis, demonstrating that ceramide elevation is either upstream or parallel to p35-inhibitable caspases. Additionally, we have confirmed that zVAD.fmk inhibits ceramide generation and apoptosis. Thus, these two caspase inhibitors, which are generally regarded as having similar broad specificities, may have very different effects in some systems (27Villa P. Kaufmann S. Earnshaw W. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1997; 22: 388-393Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (550) Google Scholar,40Cohen G.M. Biochem. J. 1997; 326: 1-16Crossref PubMed Scopus (4103) Google Scholar). This report is the first to demonstrate a difference between peptide and p35 caspase inhibitors and encourages caution when interpreting the results of caspase inhibitor studies.RESULTSExpression of Rpr in Drosophila embryos and in SL2 cells is sufficient for induction of apoptosis (1White K. Grether M.E. Abrams J.M. Young L. Farrell K. Steller H. Science. 1994; 264: 677-683Crossref PubMed Scopus (890) Google Scholar, 6Pronk G.J. Ramer K. Amiri P. Williams L.T.

Chem. 1996; 271: 25735-25737Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). To study the biochemical signals involved in Rpr-induced apoptosis, we used SL2 cells, a cell line originally derived from Drosophilaembryos, stably transfected with the Rpr open reading frame fused to an N-terminal HA tag under control of the Drosophilametallothionein promoter. Previous studies showed that Rpr transgene expression occurred rapidly after addition of 0.7 mm copper sulfate to the media (5Nordstrom W. Chen P. Steller H. Abrams J.M. Dev. Biol. 1996; 180: 213-226Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar). A detailed time course of Rpr expression following addition of copper sulfate was determined by immunoblot using an anti-HA monoclonal antibody (Fig. 1). Rpr protein expression was detected at 1–1.5 h, maximal at 2.5 h, and began to decrease at 4.5–5 h after treatment of cells with copper. This decrease in Rpr protein levels at 5 h correlated with initiation of apoptosis in the Rpr expressing cells (see below).Following induction of Rpr, cells undergo apoptosis and displayed dramatic changes in cell morphology as seen under phase contrast microscopy. Previous studies (5Nordstrom W. Chen P. Steller H. Abrams J.M. Dev. Biol. 1996; 180: 213-226Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar) showed that at 3–4 h after copper addition, numerous membrane blebs were visible, and by 6 h apoptotic bodies began to dissociate from the cells and over 12–24 h, the dying cells completely disintegrated. Rpr cells had a base-line apoptotic population of 5% which increased to a maximum of 52% by 16 h. Rpr-induced apoptosis was blocked by concomitant p35 expression in cells stably transfected with Rpr and p35, with both genes driven by the metallothionein promoter (5Nordstrom W. Chen P. Steller H. Abrams J.M. Dev. Biol. 1996; 180: 213-226Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar).To investigate whether ceramide is involved in Rpr action, ceramide levels were measured by three independent methodologies following Rpr induction. In Fig. 2 A, ceramide levels were measured by the DAG kinase assay. Ceramide levels in Rpr transfectants began to increase at 2–2.5 h after copper addition from a base-line level of 5.5 pmol of ceramide/nmol of lipid phosphorus and reached 186% of control at 5 h. In two experiments, time courses were extended out to 12 h, and ceramide levels were found to reach a peak of 208% of control at 6 h and remain elevated at 203% of control for 12 h after copper addition (data not shown). Ceramide levels in wild-type SL2 cells did not change following copper addition.Figure 2Measurement of ceramide levels, by two independent methods, and diacylglycerol levels following induction of Rpr by copper. A, cells stably transfected with Rpr and wild-type SL2 cells were treated with 0.7 mm copper sulfate for the indicated time, to induce Rpr expression, and then extracted to obtain cellular lipids. Ceramide content was measured via the DAG kinase assay and normalized for total lipid phosphorus. Base-line ceramide mass was 5.7 and 5.5 pmol of ceramide per nmol of lipid phosphorus for Rpr transfectants and wild-type cells, respectively. Each value represents mean ± S.E. of triplicate determinations from six experiments. B, cells were treated as in A, and ceramide levels were measured by HPLC fluorescence spectrometry after derivatization with OPA. By using this method, base-line ceramide mass was measured as 4.5 and 4.4 pmol of ceramide per nmol of lipid phosphorus for Rpr transfectants and wild-type cells, respectively. Data represent mean ± range of duplicate determinations from one of two similar experiments. C, cells were treated as in A, and DAG content was measured using the DAG kinase assay. Base-line DAG mass was 23 and 21 pmol of DAG per nmol of lipid phosphorus for Rpr transfectants and wild-type cells, respectively. Each value represents mean ± S.E. of triplicate determinations from two experiments.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Recently, the validity of the DAG kinase assay to measure ceramide levels has been questioned (49Watts J.D. Gu M. Polverino A.J. Patterson S.D. Aebersold R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 7292-7296Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar). To confirm the ceramide elevations detected with the DAG kinase assay after Rpr induction, ceramide levels were measured by two non-enzymatic techniques as follows: by HPLC fluorescence spectrometry after derivatization with OPA, and by metabolic labeling with [3H]palmitic acid. As seen in Fig. 2 B, the magnitude and time course of the ceramide rise in the Rpr expressing cells as determined by the HPLC fluorescence spectrometry assay were virtually identical to that obtained by the DAG kinase assay. Similarly, no elevation in ceramide levels was detected in wild-type SL2 cells after copper treatment using HPLC fluorescence spectrometry (Fig. 2, A and B).Ceramide levels were also measured using a metabolic labeling approach using cells labeled to isotopic equilibrium with [3H]palmitic acid. By this method, cells expressing Rpr showed a 71% increase in ceramide at 8 h after copper addition (data not shown). Control cells transfected with empty vector displayed no increase in ceramide at 8 h. Thus metabolic labeling with [3H]palmitic acid confirmed the specific elevation in ceramide levels detected by the DAG kinase and HPLC fluorescence spectrometry methods.DAG levels were also determined in response to expression of Rpr. In contrast to ceramide, expression of Rpr did not elevate DAG levels. In fact, copper treatment induced a small, 15–20% decrease in DAG levels in both wild-type and Rpr expressing SL2 cells (Fig. 2 C). Thus, the effect of Rpr to generate an increase in the level of ceramide was specific.Previous reports implicated caspases in Rpr-induced apoptosis since caspase inhibitors blocked Rpr-induced apoptosis (4White K. Tahaoglu E. Steller H. Science. 1996; 271: 805-807Crossref PubMed Scopus (336) Google Scholar, 5Nordstrom W. Chen P. Steller H. Abrams J.M. Dev. Biol. 1996; 180: 213-226Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar, 6Pronk G.J. Ramer K. Amiri P. Williams L.T. Science. 1996; 271: 808-810Crossref PubMed Scopus (258) Google Scholar). We sought to assay caspases and determine the rapidity of their activation in this system by use of an in vitro protease assay. Rpr transfectants were cultured for various periods in the presence of copper sulfate, after which caspase activity in cellular lysates was determined by using bovine poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP) as substrate. Since mammalian PARP is a good substrate for at least two invertebrate caspases, DCP-1 from Drosophila and ced-3 from C. elegans (28Song Z. McCall K. Steller H. Science. 1997; 275: 536-540Crossref PubMed Scopus (249) Google Scholar, 52Xue D. Shaham S. Horvitz H.R. Genes Dev. 1996; 10: 1073-1083Crossref PubMed Scopus (279) Google Scholar), bovine PARP was selected as substrate for the caspase assay using SL2 cell lysates. Cleavage of the full-length, 116-kDa form of PARP to the expected 85-kDa fragment indicative of caspase activation was first detected in lysates from Rpr-transfected cells at 2–2.5 h after copper addition (Fig. 3). Maximal caspase activity was seen at 6 h, and by 12 h there was a slight decrease in caspase activity. No caspase activity was detected in wild-type cells in the absence or presence of copper (data not shown). The immunoblotting has a limit of detection of 3 ng of PARP, and therefore this assay can detect cleavage of as little as 3% of the total amount of substrate added. These studies demonstrate that Rpr-induced apoptosis is accompanied by ceramide generation and caspase activation.Figure 3Time course of caspase activation following induction of Rpr by copper. Cells, transfected with Rpr, were treated with 0.7 mm copper sulfate for the indicated times and then lysed by homogenization in hypotonic buffer with a microcentrifuge tube pestle. Caspase activity in the lysate was measured in vitro using 100 ng of bovine PARP as substrate. Data are representative of two experiments.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Table I summarizes the time courses of Rpr expression, ceramide generation, caspase activation, and induction of apoptosis. As expected, Rpr protein expression was the most rapid of these four events following copper addition. Subsequently, ceramide levels increased and caspases became activated. These events were nearly simultaneous, being initially detectable at 2–2.5 h and maximal at 6 h after copper addition. Finally, apoptosis was detected by flow cytometry as early as 4 h and peaked at 16 h. Based on these data, it is clear that both ceramide generation and caspase activation preceded apoptosis. However, the relative order of ceramide generation and caspase activation cannot be ascertained from this information. To molecularly order these two events, we used baculovirus p35 a known inhibitor of caspases (53Bump N.J. Hackett M. Hugunin M. Seshagiri S. Brady K. Chen P. Ferenz C. Franklin S. Ghayur T. Li P. Licari P. Mankovich J. Shi L. Greenberg A.H. Miller L.K. Wong W.W.

Biol. 1996; 180: 213-226Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar). As described above, co-expression of p35 blocked Rpr-induced apoptosis. For the subsequent analysis, the Rpr + p35 cell line was compared with the Rpr2 cell line, a second, independent Rpr transfectant derived with the same construct as the original Rpr line. Both the Rpr + p35 and Rpr2 cell lines expressed comparable levels of Rpr which was somewhat less than the Rpr-transfected cell line used for the above studies, as determined by immunoblotting (data not shown). The in vitro caspase assay using bovine PARP as substrate was performed on Rpr + p35 and Rpr2 cells (Fig. 4 A). No caspase activity was detected by this assay in the Rpr + p35 cells after gene induction by copper, whereas abundant caspase activity was seen in the Rpr2 cell line. Thus it appears that p35 prevented Rpr-mediated caspase activation. Measurements of the ceramide level in Rpr + p35 cells following gene induction by copper (Fig. 4 B) demonstrated that a ceramide rise still occurs and in fact was slightly greater in these cells, despite complete blockade of apoptosis and caspase activity. Cells that were stably transfected with only the p35 gene showed no changes in ceramide level following gene induction by copper (data not shown). These data strongly suggest that ceramide elevation is either upstream or parallel to p35-inhibitable caspases.Figure 4Ceramide levels and caspase activation in Rpr + p35-transfected cells following induction of Rpr and p35 by copper. A, Rpr2 cells and Rpr + p35 cells were treated with 0.7 mm copper sulfate for the indicated times, and caspase activity was measured in vitro as in Fig. 3. Data are representative of two experiments. B, Rpr2 and Rpr + p35 cells were treated as in Fig. 2 A, and ceramide content was measured using the DAG kinase assay. Expression of Rpr was simultaneously analyzed by immunoblot (data not shown) and the level of expression quantified by densitometry, and ceramide levels were normalized for Rpr expression. Each value represents mean ± S.E. of triplicate determinations from three experiments.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)In contrast to p35, the peptide caspase inhibitor, zVAD.fmk, was reported to inhibit both Rpr-mediated ceramide generation and apoptosis (6Pronk G.J. Ramer K. Amiri P. Williams L.T. Science. 1996; 271: 808-810Crossref PubMed Scopus (258) Google Scholar). In the present investigation, we re-examined this issue. zVAD.fmk had no effect on Rpr expression or base-line ceramide levels (data not shown). However, Rpr-induced apoptosis, as measured by cells with hypodiploid DNA content at 18 h after copper addition, was completely inhibited by 10 μm zVAD.fmk; an IC50 for this effect was approximately 5 μmzVAD.fmk (Fig. 5 A). Ceramide generation, measured 4 h after copper addition, was similarly inhibited by zVAD.fmk. Complete inhibition of Rpr-induced ceramide generation occurred with 10 μm zVAD.fmk, and an IC50 was approximately 3 μm zVAD.fmk (Fig. 5 B).

The amino-terminal region of ATF-2 containing the transcriptional activation domain is phosphorylated by stress-activated kinases, which leads to activation of ATF-2. We report here that CBP, which was originally identified as a co-activator of CREB, directly binds to the b-ZIP region of ATF-2 via a Cys/His-rich region termed C/H2, and potentiates trans-activation by ATF-2. The b-ZIP region of ATF-2 was previously shown to interact with the amino-terminal region intramolecularly and to inhibit trans-activating capacity. The binding of CBP to the b-ZIP region abrogates this intramolecular interaction. The adenovirus 13S E1A protein which binds to the b-ZIP region of ATF-2 also inhibited this intramolecular interaction, suggesting that both CBP and 13S E1A share a similar function as positive regulators of ATF-2. We found that the b-ZIP regions of c-Jun and CREB also interact with the C/H2 domain of CBP, suggesting that CBP acts as a regulator for a group of b-ZIP-containing proteins. These results shed light on a novel aspect of CBP function as a regulator for a group of b-ZIP-containing proteins.

The b-ZIP region of ATF-2 was previously shown to interact with the amino-terminal region intramolecularly and to inhibit trans-activating capacity. The binding of CBP to the b-ZIP region abrogates this intramolecular interaction. The adenovirus 13S E1A protein which binds to the b-ZIP region of ATF-2 also inhibited this intramolecular interaction, suggesting that both CBP and 13S E1A share a similar function as positive regulators of ATF-2. We found that the b-ZIP regions of c-Jun and CREB also interact with the C/H2 domain of CBP, suggesting that CBP acts as a regulator for a group of b-ZIP-containing proteins. These results shed light on a novel aspect of CBP function as a regulator for a group of b-ZIP-containing proteins. cAMP response element histone acetyltransferase cAMP-dependent protein kinase stress-activated kinase phosphate-buffered saline glutathioneS-transferase polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis chloramphenicol acetyltransferase. So far, a number of transcription factors of the ATF/CREB family have been identified. All members of this family contain a DNA-binding domain consisting of a cluster of basic amino acids and a leucine zipper region, the so-called b-ZIP. They form homodimers or heterodimers through the leucine zipper and bind to the cAMP response element (CRE)1 (1Hai T. Curran T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 3720-3724Crossref PubMed Scopus (1117) Google Scholar). Among many of the transcription factors of the ATF/CREB family, three factors, ATF-2 (also called CRE-BP1), ATF-a, and CRE-BPa, form a subgroup (2Maekawa T. Sakura H. Kanei-Ishii C. Sudo T.

A common characteristic of this group of factors is the presence of a transcriptional activation domain containing the metal finger structure located in the amino-terminal region (5Nomura N. Zu Y.-L. Maekawa T. Tabata S. Akiyama T. Ishii S. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 4259-4266Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 6Matsuda S. Maekawa T. Ishii S. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 18188-18193Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). These factors are capable of forming homodimers or heterodimers with c-Jun and bind to CRE (1Hai T. Curran T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 3720-3724Crossref PubMed Scopus (1117) Google Scholar, 5Nomura N. Zu Y.-L. Maekawa T. Tabata S. Akiyama T. Ishii S. J. Biol.

Among these three factors, ATF-2 has been more extensively studied and shown to be ubiquitously expressed with the highest level of expression being observed in the brain (7Takeda J. Maekawa T. Sudo T. Seino Y. Imura H. Saito N. Tanaka C. Ishii S. Oncogene. 1991; 6: 1009-1014PubMed Google Scholar). The mutant mice generated by gene targeting exhibited decreased postnatal viability and growth with a defect in endochondrial ossification and a decreased number of cerebellar Purkinje cells (8Reimond A.M. Grusby M.J. Kosaras B. Fries J.W.U. Mori R. Maniwa S. Clauss I.M. Collins T. Sidman R.L. Glimcher M.J. Glimcher L.H. Nature. 1996; 379: 262-265Crossref PubMed Scopus (243) Google Scholar). The stress-activated protein kinases (SAPK) such as Jun amino-terminal kinase and p38 phosphorylate this group of factors at sites close to the amino-terminal transcriptional activation domain, and stimulate their trans-activating capacity (9Gupta S. Campbell D. Dérijard B. Davis R.J. Science. 1995; 267: 389-393Crossref PubMed Scopus (1339) Google Scholar, 10Livingstone C. Patel G. Jones N.

EMBO J. 1995; 14: 1798-1811Crossref PubMed Scopus (571) Google Scholar). Since a group of factors of the ATF/CREB family including CREB are activated via direct phosphorylation by cAMP-dependent protein kinase (PKA) (12Gonzalez G.A. Montminy M.R. Cell. 1989; 59: 675-680Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2063) Google Scholar), these two groups of factors, CREB and ATF-2, are linked to the distinct signaling cascades involving the PKA and SAPK pathways. The adenovirus 13S E1A activates CRE-dependent transcription, and this transcriptional activation is mediated by ATF-2 (13Liu F. Green M.R. Cell. 1990; 67: 1217-1224Abstract Full Text PDF Scopus (266) Google Scholar, 14Maekawa T. Matsuda S. Fujisawa J.-I. Yoshida M. Ishii S. Oncogene. 1991; 6: 627-632PubMed Google Scholar). E1A binds to the b-ZIP region of ATF-2 (15Liu F. Gree M.R. Nature. 1994; 368: 520-525Crossref PubMed Scopus (225) Google Scholar). Recently, it was reported that the b-ZIP region of ATF-2 interacts with the amino-terminal region intramolecularly (16Li X.-Y. Green M.R. Genes Dev. 1996; 10: 517-527Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar), and this interaction appears to inhibit thetrans-activating capacity of ATF-2. However, the co-activator that binds to the amino-terminal activation domain remains unidentified, and the mechanism of transcriptional activation by ATF-2 needs to be clarified. The transcriptional co-activator CBP was originally identified as a protein that binds to the PKA-phosphorylated form of CREB (17Chrivia J.C. Kwok R.P.S. Lamb N. Hagiwara M. Montminy M.R. Goodman R.H. Nature. 1993; 365: 855-859Crossref PubMed Scopus (1770) Google Scholar). CBP also binds to multiple components of the basal transcriptional machinery, including TFIIB (18Kwok R.P.S. Lundblad J.R. Chrivia J.C. Richards J.P. Bachinger H.P. Brennan R.G. Roberts S.G.R. Green M.R. Goodman R.H.

Chem. 1996; 271: 2373-2375Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (186) Google Scholar), suggesting that CBP serves as a molecular bridge between CREB and the basal transcriptional machinery. In addition to CREB, many other transcription factors including c-Jun (20Arias J. Alberts A.S. Brindle P. Claret F.X. Smeal T. Karin M. Feramisco J. Montminy M. Nature. 1994; 370: 226-229Crossref PubMed Scopus (681) Google Scholar), c-Fos (21Bannister A.J. Kouzarides T. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 4758-4762Crossref PubMed Scopus (319) Google Scholar), c-Myb (22Dai P. Akimaru H. Tanaka Y. Hou D.-X. Yasukawa T. Kanei-Ishii C. Takahashi T. Ishii S. Genes Dev. 1996; 10: 528-540Crossref PubMed Scopus (303) Google Scholar), nuclear hormone receptors (23Kamei Y. Xu L. Heinzel T. Torchia J. Kurokawa R. Gloss B. Lin S.-C. Heyman R.A. Rose D.W. Glass C.K. Rosenfeld M.G.

Nature. 1996; 383: 344-347Crossref PubMed Scopus (423) Google Scholar), and MyoD (26Eckner R. Yao T.-P. Oldread E. Livingston D.M. Genes Dev. 1996; 10: 2478-2490Crossref PubMed Scopus (320) Google Scholar) were recently demonstrated to bind to CBP (for review, see Ref. 27Giles R.H. Peters D.J.M. Breuning M.H. Trends Genet. 1998; 14: 178-183Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (361) Google Scholar). CBP contributes to the transcriptional activation mediated by each of these factors. Although multiple transcription factors bind to CBP, there is a striking difference in the role of CBP depending on the transcriptional activator. For instance, CBP binds to the transcriptional activation domains of CREB and c-Myb (17Chrivia J.C. Kwok R.P.S. Lamb N. Hagiwara M. Montminy M.R. Goodman R.H. Nature. 1993; 365: 855-859Crossref PubMed Scopus (1770) Google Scholar, 22Dai P. Akimaru H. Tanaka Y. Hou D.-X. Yasukawa T. Kanei-Ishii C. Takahashi T. Ishii S. Genes Dev. 1996; 10: 528-540Crossref PubMed Scopus (303) Google Scholar). In the case of nuclear hormone receptors, however, other co-activators bind to the transcriptional activation domain, and CBP binds to a different domain, indicating that CBP functions as a integrator for nuclear hormone receptors (23Kamei Y. Xu L. Heinzel T. Torchia J. Kurokawa R. Gloss B. Lin S.-C. Heyman R.A. Rose D.W. Glass C.K. Rosenfeld M.G.

Nature. 1996; 383: 99-103Crossref PubMed Scopus (851) Google Scholar). The amount of CBP in mammalian cells appears to be limiting, as a 50% reduction in the amount of CBP causes abnormal pattern formation in human (known as Rubinstein-Taybi syndrome) (28Petrij F. Giles R.H. Dauwerse H.G. Saris J.J. Hennekam R.C.M. Masuno M. Tommerup N. van Ommen G.B. Goodman R.H. Peters D.J.M. Breuning M.H. Nature. 1995; 376: 348-351Crossref PubMed Scopus (1029) Google Scholar) and mouse (29Tanaka Y. Naruse I. Maekawa T. Masuya H. Shiroishi T. Ishii S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 10215-10220Crossref PubMed Scopus (261) Google Scholar). Recent genetic analyses using Drosophila CBP mutants indicated that CBP is required for transcriptional activation by Cubitus interruptus (Ci) and Dorsal (Dl), which are homologs of mammalian factors glioblastoma (GLI) and NF-κB, respectively (30Akimaru H. Chen Y. Dai P. Hou D.-X. Nonaka M. Smolik S.M. Armstromg S. Goodman R. Ishii S. Nature. 1997; 386: 735-738Crossref PubMed Scopus (238) Google Scholar, 31Akimaru H. Hou D.-X. Ishii S. Nat. Genet. 1997; 17: 211-214Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar). These results suggest that the decreased expression level of target genes of these transcription factors such as Bmp and Twist lead to the deficiency in pattern formation. In addition to the finding that CBP itself has histone acetyltransferase (HAT) activity (32Ogryzko V.V. Schiltz R.L. Russanova V. Howard B.H. Nakatani Y. Cell. 1996; 87: 953-959Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2409) Google Scholar, 33Bannister A.J. Kouzarides T. Nature. 1996; 384: 641-643Crossref PubMed Scopus (1535) Google Scholar), CBP forms a complex with multiple HATs such as P/CAF, ACTR, and SRC-1 (34Yang X.-J. Ogryzko V.V. Nishikawa J. Howard B.H. Nakatani Y. Nature. 1996; 382: 319-324Crossref PubMed Scopus (1320) Google Scholar, 35Chen H. Lin R.J. Schiltz R.L. Chakravarti D. Nash A. Nagy L. Privalsky M.L. Nakatani Y. Evans R.M.

Tsai M.-J. O'Malley B.W. Nature. 1997; 389: 194-198Crossref PubMed Scopus (1070) Google Scholar), suggesting that the CBP complex contributes to transcriptional activation by disrupting the repressive chromatin structure. The cbp gene family contains at least one other member, p300, that was originally identified through its ability to bind to the adenovirus E1A protein (37Eckner R. Ewen M.E. Newsome D. Gerdes M. DeCapiro J.A. Lawrence J.B. Livingston D.M. Genes Dev. 1994; 8: 869-884Crossref PubMed Scopus (927) Google Scholar), and E1A binds to both CBP and p300 (38Lundblad J.R. Kwok R.P.S. Laurance M.E. Harter M.L. Goodman R.H. Nature. 1995; 374: 85-88Crossref PubMed Scopus (531) Google Scholar, 39Arany Z. Newsome D. Oldread E. Livingston D.M. Eckner R. Nature. 1995; 374: 81-84Crossref PubMed Scopus (492) Google Scholar). Binding of E1A to CBP inhibits transcriptional activation mediated by CBP. Since E1A and HAT P/CAF bind to the same region of CBP, the mechanism of inhibition of CBP activity by E1A was postulated to be due to blocking of P/CAF binding to CBP (34Yang X.-J. Ogryzko V.V. Nishikawa J. Howard B.H. Nakatani Y. Nature. 1996; 382: 319-324Crossref PubMed Scopus (1320) Google Scholar). To investigate the possibility that CBP is also involved in transcriptional activation by ATF-2, we have examined for a direct interaction between CBP and ATF-2. Our results indicate that CBP functions as a regulator of ATF-2 by binding to its b-ZIP region. To express various forms of GST-CBP fusion proteins in Escherichia coli, the plasmids pGEX-KIX, pGEX-Bromo, pGEX-C/H2, and pGEX-C/H3 were made by inserting the appropriate fragment encoding the 265- (amino acids 454–718), 104- (amino acids 1087–1190), 437- (amino acids 1190–1626), and 257-amino acid (amino acids 1621–1877) regions of mouse CBP, respectively, into the appropriate site of the pGEX vector (see Ref. 40Smith D.B. Johnson K.S. Gene (Amst.). 1988; 67: 31-40Crossref PubMed Scopus (5047) Google Scholar; Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). The plasmid to express the GST fusion protein containing the amino-terminal 253 amino acids of ATF-2 was constructed using the pGEX-2TK vector. The modified pSP65 vector pSPUTK (Stratagene) was used for in vitro transcription/translation of various forms of ATF-2. A series of mutants of ATF-2 was described previously (6Matsuda S. Maekawa T. Ishii S. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 18188-18193Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The plasmid to express CREB, c-Jun, c-Fos, or E1A byin vitro transcription/translation system was also made using pGEM (Promega), pBluescript, and the pcDNA3 vector (Invitrogen), respectively. The plasmids to express Gal4-CBPC/H2 in which the C/H2 domain of CBP (amino acids 1182–1500) was fused to the DNA-binding domain of Gal4 (amino acids 1–147) were constructed by the polymerase chain reaction-based method using the cytomegalovirus promoter-containing vector, pSTCX556 (41Severne Y. Wieland S. Schaffner W. Rusconi S. EMBO J. 1988; 7: 2503-2508Crossref PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar). The plasmid encoding the VP16 fusion protein containing the carboxyl-terminal region of ATF-2 (amino acids 291–505), CREB (amino acids 191–341), or c-Jun (amino acids 201–334) joined to the VP16 activation domain was constructed similarly. The plasmids to express CBP and E1A were described previously (22Dai P. Akimaru H. Tanaka Y. Hou D.-X. Yasukawa T. Kanei-Ishii C. Takahashi T. Ishii S. Genes Dev. 1996; 10: 528-540Crossref PubMed Scopus (303) Google Scholar). The GST pull-down assay using GST-CBP and in vitro translated ATF-2, CREB, c-Jun, or c-Fos was essentially performed as described (22Dai P. Akimaru H. Tanaka Y. Hou D.-X. Yasukawa T. Kanei-Ishii C. Takahashi T. Ishii S. Genes Dev. 1996; 10: 528-540Crossref PubMed Scopus (303) Google Scholar). The expression of the GST fusion protein or GST alone in E. coliand preparation of the bacterial lysates containing these proteins were done as described (42Nomura T. Sakai N. Sarai A. Sudo T. Kanei-Ishii C. Ramsay R.G. Favier D. Gonda T.J. Ishii S. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 21914-21923Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Samples of bacterial lysate containing 20 μg of GST or GST-CBP were rocked for 2–3 h at 4 °C with 100 μl of glutathione-Sepharose beads (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). The beads were washed with 1 ml of PBS 5 times and then with 1 ml of binding buffer (20 mm Hepes, pH 7.7, 75 mm KCl, 0.1 mm EDTA, 2.5 mm MgCl2, 1% skim milk, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 0.05% Nonidet P-40). Various forms of ATF-2, CREB, c-Jun, or c-Fos were synthesized with [35S]methionine using an in vitrotranscription/translation kit according to the procedures described by the supplier (Promega). Then, a sample from the reaction was mixed with 750 μl of binding buffer and the GST or GST-CBP affinity resin. After rocking at 4 °C overnight, the resin was washed with 1 ml of binding buffer 5 times and mixed with SDS-sample buffer, and the bound proteins were released by boiling. The proteins were analyzed by SDS-PAGE followed by autoradiography. In the experiments to examine the effects of phosphorylation by PKA, 25 μl of lysate containing the in vitro translated CREB was mixed with 175 μl of the kinase buffer to give final concentrations of 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 100 mm NaCl, 12 mm MgCl2, and 2.5 mm ATP, and the mixture was incubated with or without 100 units of the catalytic subunit of bovine PKA (Sigma). The potato acid phosphatase treatment of the in vitro translated CREB was performed as described (22Dai P. Akimaru H. Tanaka Y. Hou D.-X. Yasukawa T. Kanei-Ishii C. Takahashi T. Ishii S. Genes Dev. 1996; 10: 528-540Crossref PubMed Scopus (303) Google Scholar) except for the use of 1 milliunit of phosphatase. To examine the intramolecular interaction of ATF-2, the GST pull-down assay using the GST fusion protein containing the amino-terminal portion of ATF-2 and the in vitro translated carboxyl-terminal region of ATF-2 was done similarly, except for the use of a low stringency binding buffer (10 mm Hepes, pH 8.0, 50 mm KCl, 2.5 mm MgCl2, 50 mm ZnCl2, 0.025% Nonidet P-40, 0.5 mm dithiothreitol, 0.5 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 100 μg/ml bovine serum albumin). To investigate whether the SAPK-phosphorylated activation domain of ATF-2 binds to CBP, GST pull-down assays were performed as follows. HepG2 cells were transfected with 5 μg of the ATF-2 expression plasmid, and the transfected cells were treated with sorbitol (0.5m) or PBS for 30 min before the preparation of cell lysates. Three days after transfection, cell lysates were prepared using the lysis buffer (50 mm Hepes, pH 7.5, 250 mm NaCl, 0.2 mm EDTA, 50 mm NaF, 0.5% Nonidet P-40, 2 mm Na3VO4, 25 mm β-glycerophosphate, and 0.1 nm okadaic acid) containing the protease inhibitor mixture (Boehringer Mannheim) and mixed with the resin containing 20 μg of the GST-CBP fusion protein containing various parts of CBP. The bound proteins were eluted by SDS sample buffer and analyzed by Western blotting using the anti-ATF-2 antibody and chemiluminescent detection reagents (New England Biolabs). To investigate thein vivo interaction between the C/H2 domain of CBP and the b-ZIP region of ATF-2, two-hybrid assays were done using HepG2 cells essentially as described (43Kanei-Ishii C. Tanikawa J. Nakai A. Morimoto R.I. Ishii S. Science. 1997; 277: 246-248Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). A mixture containing 1 μg of the luciferase reporter plasmid containing three copies of the Gal4-binding site linked to the TK promoter, 3 μg of the Gal4-CBPC/H2 expression plasmid, 3 μg of VP16-ATF-2, or VP16 expression plasmid, and 0.5 μg of the internal control plasmid pRL-TK (Promega), in which the sea-pansy luciferase gene is linked to the TK promoter, was transfected into HepG2 cells by using the CaPO4 method. Luciferase assays were performed using the dual-luciferase assay system (Promega). For co-immunoprecipitation of CBP and ATF-2, a mixture of 5 μg of the CBP expression plasmid, pcDNA3-CBP, and 5 μg of the plasmid to express wild type ATF-2 was transfected by using the CaPO4 method into 293T cells which corresponds to the adenovirus type 5-transformed human embryonic kidney 293 cells containing the SV40 large T antigen (44DuBridge R.B. Tang P. Hsia H.C. Phaik-Mooi L. Miller J.H. Calos M.P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1987; 84: 156-160Crossref PubMed Scopus (754) Google Scholar). Two days after transfection, cells were lysed by rocking in the lysis buffer (50 mm Hepes, pH 7.5, 250 mm NaCl, 0.2 mm EDTA, 10 mm NaF, 0.5% Nonidet P-40) at 4 °C for 1 h and centrifuged at 13,000 rpm for 20 min. The supernatant was mixed with 1.5 volume of the lysis buffer lacking NaCl to decrease the salt concentration to 100 mm. Lysates were immunoprecipitated using anti-CBP antibodies NT (Upstate Biotechnology Inc.) or anti-β-galactosidase, and the immune complexes were separated on 10% SDS gels and analyzed by Western blotting using anti-ATF-2 antibodies (7Takeda J. Maekawa T. Sudo T. Seino Y. Imura H. Saito N. Tanaka C. Ishii S. Oncogene. 1991; 6: 1009-1014PubMed Google Scholar) and ECL detection reagents (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). For co-immunoprecipitation of Gal4-CBPC/H2 and VP16-CREBDBD or VP16-c-JunDBD, a mixture of 5 μg of the Gal4-CBPC/H2 expression plasmid and 5 μg of the plasmid to express VP16-CREBDBD or VP16-c-JunDBD was transfected into 293 cells. Immunoprecipitation was performed similarly using anti-VP16 antibody V-20 (Santa Cruz), and the immune complexes were separated on 10% SDS gels and analyzed by Western blotting using anti-Gal4 antibody DBD (Santa Cruz) and chemiluminescent detection reagents (New England Biolabs). The CAT co-transfection assay was done essentially as described (14Maekawa T. Matsuda S. Fujisawa J.-I. Yoshida M. Ishii S. Oncogene. 1991; 6: 627-632PubMed Google Scholar). A mixture of 4 μg of the reporter plasmid DNA pMFcolCAT6MBS-I, in which the CAT gene is linked to the mouse α2(I)-collagen promoter and six tandem repeats of the Myb-binding site MBS-I, 5 μg of effector plasmid DNA to express c-Myb-ATF-2 fusion protein consisting of the DNA-binding domain of c-Myb and full-length ATF-2, and 1 μg of the internal control plasmid pact-β-gal was transfected into Chinese hamster ovary cells (CHO-K1). The plasmid to express c-MybDBD-ATF-2-Gla4, in which the carboxyl-terminal 512 amino acids of c-MybDBA-ATF-2 containing the b-ZIP region was replaced by the DNA-binding domain of Gal4 (amino acids 1–147), was constructed using the polymerase chain reaction-based method and also used for co-transfection assays as the effector plasmid. To examine the effect of E1A and CBP, 5 μg of the E1A13S expression plasmid and 6 μg of the CBP expression plasmid were added. The total amount of DNA was adjusted to 21 μg by adding the control plasmid DNA lacking the cDNA to be expressed. Forty hours after transfection, cell lysates were prepared, and CAT assays were done. The amounts of lysates used for the CAT assay were normalized with the β-galactosidase activity expressed from the internal control plasmid pact-β-gal. For UV stimulation, cells were washed with PBS 8 h before preparation of cell lysates and irradiated (45 J/m2) for 15 s. All co-transfection experiments were repeated at least two times, and the difference between each set of experiments was no more than 20%. Typical results are shown in Fig. 4. To examine whether CBP directly binds to ATF-2, we first used the GST pull-down assay. The full-length form of mouse CBP synthesized using an in vitrotranscription/translation system bound to the GST fusion protein containing full-length ATF-2 (data not shown). To narrow down the specific region in CBP responsible for interaction with ATF-2, a series of GST fusion proteins containing various parts of CBP were made and used for the GST pull-down assays (Fig. 1, A and B). The35S-ATF-2 protein was synthesized using an in vitro transcription/translation system and mixed with various GST-CBP resins. Approximately 51% of input ATF-2 bound to the GST fusion protein containing the Cys/His-rich region of CBP, termed the C/H2 domain, whereas other GST fusion proteins containing other regions of CBP and GST alone as a control did not interact with ATF-2 (less than 2% of input) (Fig. 1 C). To examine further which region of ATF-2 interacts with CBP, we used deletion mutants of ATF-2 for the binding assay (Fig. 2, A and B). We previously identified the amino-terminal region between amino acids 19 and 50, which contains a metal finger, as a transcriptional activation domain (6Matsuda S. Maekawa T. Ishii S. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 18188-18193Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The NT50 mutant lacking this activation domain still retained almost full capacity to bind to CBP. About 27 and 30% of the input wild type ATF-2 protein and NT50 bound to the GST-CBP resin, respectively. The two amino-truncated mutants, NT253 and NT341, lacking the amino-terminal 253 and 341 amino acids, respectively, also bound to CBP as efficiently as the wild type. These results indicate that CBP binds to the carboxyl-terminal 164-amino acid region containing the b-ZIP region. The two mutants lacking the cluster of basic amino acids of the b-ZIP region, ΔBR and NT253ΔBR, failed to interact with CBP. In addition, the two mutants in which the third and fourth leucine in the b-ZIP region were changed to valine, L34V and NT253L34V, did not bind to CBP. The CT91 mutant lacking the carboxyl-terminal 91 amino acid region bound to the GST-CBP resin, but its binding efficiency was significantly lower than that of wild type. These results indicate that CBP binds to the b-ZIP region of ATF-2 (amino acids 338–407) and that the region downstream from the b-ZIP region enhances the interaction with CBP. To confirm thein vivo interaction between ATF-2 and CBP in mammalian cells, co-immunoprecipitation was performed (Fig. 3 A). The two plasmids to express ATF-2 and CBP were transfected into 293T cells, and the cell lysates were immunoprecipitated with anti-CBP antibody or control antibody against anti-β-galactosidase. ATF-2 was co-immunoprecipitated with anti-CBP antibody but not with the anti-β-galactosidase antibody. To confirm further the in vivo interaction between ATF-2 and CBP, we performed in vivo two-hybrid assays in mammalian cells (Fig. 3 B). Two chimeric proteins were created by fusing the CBP fragment containing the C/H2 region in frame to the DNA-binding domain of Gal4 and by fusing the carboxyl-terminal region of ATF-2 containing the b-ZIP to the transcriptional activation domain of VP16. Transcriptional activation was then examined in HepG2 cells transfected with a combination of these constructs. The basal activity is the luciferase activity obtained by a combination of Gal4 DNA-binding domain and VP-16. The VP16 protein fused to the carboxyl-terminal region of ATF-2 stimulated Gal4-CBP activity 7.3-fold, whereas VP16 alone stimulated only 2.2-fold. Furthermore, VP16-ATF-2 enhanced the Gal4 activity only 1.7-fold. These results indicated that the C/H2 domain of CBP interact with the carboxyl-terminal region of ATF-2 containing the b-ZIP structure. To investigate the role of CBP in transcriptional activation by ATF-2, we performed some CAT co-transfection experiments using Chinese hamster ovary cells (Fig. 4). Since ATF-2 was expressed in all of the cell lines examined, it was difficult to analyze the transcriptional activation resulting from the exogenous ATF-2 expressed from the transfected DNA. Therefore, we used the fusion protein consisting of the c-myb gene product (c-Myb) and ATF-2 (14Maekawa T. Matsuda S. Fujisawa J.-I. Yoshida M. Ishii S. Oncogene. 1991; 6: 627-632PubMed Google Scholar). c-Myb is a sequence-specific DNA-binding protein, which is predominantly expressed in immature hematopoietic cells but not in many other cells. Therefore, the transcriptional activation by the fusion protein consisting of the DNA-binding domain of c-Myb and full-length ATF-2 (MybDBD-ATF-2) can be analyzed without any interference from the endogenous protein. The plasmid pMFcolCAT6MBS-I, in which the CAT gene is linked to the mouse α2(I)-collagen promoter and six tandem repeats of the Myb-binding site MBS-I, was used as a reporter. Under the conditions used, CAT expression from this reporter plasmid was activated 3.5-fold by the MybDBD-ATF-2 fusion protein (comparelanes 1 and 4). Co-transfection of the CBP expression plasmid with the MybDBD-ATF-2 expression plasmids enhanced the level of CAT activity about 2.7-fold (cf. lanes 4 and 5). The E1A13S product also potentiated by 2.6-fold the trans-activation by MybDBD-ATF-2 as reported previously (cf. lanes 4 and 6), but additional enhancement of the trans-activating capacity of Myb"

Cauliflower mosaic virus (CaMV)1 is the type member of the caulimovirus group, a family of plant pararetroviruses (for review, see Ref. 1Rothnie H.M. Chapdelaine Y. Hohn T. Adv. Virus. Res. 1994; 44: 1-67Crossref PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar). The virion is made of 420 subunits of processed forms of the coat protein (44, 39, and 37 kDa) that build an icosahedral viral particle of symmetry T = 7 (2Cheng R.H. Olson N.H. Baker T.S. Virology. 1992; 186: 655-668Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). A small viral protein of 15 kDa, encoded by ORF III (p15) is found associated with the purified virus particle (3Dautel S.

This protein contains a C-terminal proline-rich nonspecific DNA-binding domain that is conserved in the caulimovirus group and similar to the C terminus of the histone-like proteins (4Mougeot J.L.

It was suggested that this domain could be involved in compaction of the viral genomic DNA (4Mougeot J.L. Guidasci T. Wurch T. Lebeurier G. Mesnard J.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Virology. 1997; 239: 352-359Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar), although its exact function remains unknown. The analysis of the amino acid sequence of the N terminus of p15 predicted a coiled-coil structure. A coiled-coil is a protein structure that allows the oligomerization of a protein via association of two or more α-helices. Coiled-coils are found in a large class of fibrous proteins like keratin, myosin, and fibrinogen, and more recently, they have been recognized as a dimerization element of transcription factors (8Lupas A. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1996; 21: 375-382Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1008) Google Scholar). Sequences that are capable of forming coiled-coils are characterized by a heptad repeat of seven residues denoted “a” to “g” (9McLachlan A.D. Stewart M. J. Mol. Biol. 1975; 98: 293-304Crossref PubMed Scopus (569) Google Scholar, 10Cohen C. Parry D.A.D. Proteins. 1990; 7: 1-15Crossref PubMed Scopus (667) Google Scholar, 11Kammerer R.A. Matrix Biol. 1997; 15: 555-565Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar) in which the “a” and “d” positions are occupied predominantly by hydrophobic amino acids, whereas polar residues are found elsewhere. A hydrophobic interface is formed between the helices and represents the major driving force for the stabilization of the oligomer (12Harbury P.B. Zhang T. Kim P.S. Alber T. Science. 1993; 262: 1401-1407Crossref PubMed Scopus (1338) Google Scholar). Positions “e” and “g” are frequently charged residues which might contribute to stability, the specificity of helix association, and their relative order of oligomerization (13Monera O.D. Zhou N.E.

There can be two, three, four, or five helices in the bundle, in parallel or in opposite orientation (for review, see Ref. 8Lupas A. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1996; 21: 375-382Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1008) Google Scholar). We have characterized the coiled-coil domain of p15, located at its N terminus, and have shown that the protein assembles into a parallel tetramer through this domain to adopt a rodlike structure. The CaMV ORF III sequence and its derivatives were amplified by PCR from the Strasbourg strain cloned in pBR322 (pCa37; Ref. 18Lebeurier G. Hirth L. Hohn T. Hohn B. Gene (Amst.). 1980; 12: 139-146Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). The following sense oligonucleotides, 5′-AAACCCGGGGAATTCACCATGGCTAATCTTAATCAGATCCAAAAG-3′ (11711), 5′-AAACCCGGGGAATCCACCATGGGATCCCAAAATCCTATTAAAGAAAGCTTA-3′ (17558) and antisense oligonucleotides, 5′-AAAAGATCTTTACCAGGTTAAAGCTTTAGGGTTTC-3′ (15975), 5′-AAAAGATCTTTATTGTTCTATTAGTTGCTCTTTAGG-3′ (15976), 5′-AAAAGATCTGGATCCCTAAAATTGATTCGGCCATCCTGCTGGAGC-3′ (11710) were used for the amplification. The combinations of oligonucleotides for the PCR reaction were: 11711 and 11710 for the full-length p15, 11711 and 15975 for p(1–118), 11711 and 15976 for p(1–82), and finally 17558 and 11710 for p(33–129). All PCR reactions were performed as follows: 94 °C for 1 min, 50 °C for 1 min, and 72 °C for 1 min for 30 cycles. An EcoRI and an NcoI site at the N terminus and aBglII site at the C terminus were generated by PCR for cloning in pGAD424, pGBT9 (CLONTECH), and pET-3D (Novagen). The entire sequence of each construct was verified by DNA sequencing. The clone p(Δ34–107) was generated by a BamHI digest of p15wt cloned into pGAD424 that allowed the deletion of an p15 internalBamHI fragment. The linearized plasmid was ligated and used in the two-hybrid assay. The fusion of the N terminus of p15 was then generated without adding or changing any amino acids of the protein. The construct p(1–34) was generated by elution of theEcoRI-BamHI fragment of p15wt in pGAD424 and cloning in the pGAD424 vector linearized with the same enzymes. This cloning generated a fusion of 5 amino acids at the C terminus (MNRRY) of the first 34 amino acids of ORF II of CaMV that are not present in the wt sequence. The PCR mutagenesis was done according to Vogel and Das (19Vogel A.M. Das A. Mol. Microbiol. 1994; 12: 811-817Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar) with primers 11710 and 11711. The PCR products were cloned in pGAD424 as described previously. The RTBV genome served as template for the PCR amplification of the ORF II. PCR was performed using the forward oligonucleotide 5′-ACGTAAGTGCCCATATGAGCGCTGA TTATCCAACTTTCAAGG-3′ and the reverse oligonucleotide 5′-GCCGCAGGATCCTCATGCTGGATATTTTCTTTTAATTCC-3′. The PCR fragment was digested with NdeI and BamHI and cloned into the procaryotic expression vector pET-3A (Novagen). The resulting plasmid allowed the expression of the complete ORF II product. The bacterial pellet from 3 liters of culture was resuspended in 50 ml of TP buffer (20 mm Tris, pH 7.0, 20 mm NaCl, 1 mmEDTA, 1 mm EGTA, 5% glycerol, and mixture of inhibitors of proteases (Boehringer Mannheim)), and the cell suspension was lysed by sonication or with a French press. The lysate was heated at 65 °C for 15 min and centrifuged at 30,000 × g for 60 min at 4 °C. The supernatant was kept and centrifuged at 100,000 ×g for 60 min at 4 °C. The supernatant was loaded on a CM-Sephacellulose column that was previously pre-equilibrated in TP buffer. p15 was eluted with TP buffer + 100 mm sodium chloride. The eluted protein was diluted 10-fold with 0.5× TP buffer and passed through the column once more. The eluted protein was then diluted 5-fold in TP buffer, pH 8.8, and loaded on a DEAE-Sepharose column. The protein was eluted with TP buffer, pH. 8.8, plus 250 mm NaCl and concentrated with Centriprep P50 (Amicon). This procedure yielded around 10 mg of pure protein/liter of culture medium. The peptide sequences were as follows; pep(wt) is GSCECKQNLNQIQKEVSEILSDQKSMKADIKAILELL, pep(K→N) is GSCECKQNLNQIQKEVSEILSDQKSMNA DIKAILELL, and pep(K→D) is GSCECKQNLNQIQKEVSEILSDQKSMDADIKAILELL. The peptides were synthesized, freeze-dried, dissolved in water to a concentration of 1 mg/ml, and stored as stock solution at –80 °C. The proteins were mixed with 1/3 of the final volume of loading buffer containing 5% SDS, 30% glycerol, and 0.01% bromphenol blue. The SDS-PAGE was performed as described elsewhere (20Schägger H. von Jagow G. Anal. Biochem. 1987; 166: 368-379Crossref PubMed Scopus (10480) Google Scholar). Analytical ultracentrifugation was performed according to Ref. 21Faix J. Steinmetz M. Boves H. Kammerer R.A. Lottspeich F. Mintert U. Murphy J. Stock A. Aebi U. Gerish G. Cell. 1996; 86: 631-642Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar. The recombinant protein was analyzed at 20 °C in 12.5 mm Tris, pH 8.3, and 90 mm glycine. The protein concentration was adjusted to 0.2 mg/ml. Sedimentation velocity (SV) and equilibrium (SE) of the sample was performed using the Beckman model XLA analytical ultracentrifuge equipped with absorption optics. The SV run was carried out at 56,000 rpm, at 20 °C in a 12-mm double-sector cell and recorded at 278 nm. The SE run was carried out in the same cell, as previously mentioned, but filled only about 3 mm filling height in addition to FC-43 bottom fluid and run at 18,000 rpm at 20 °C. The molecular mass was calculated using a floating base-line computer program that adjusts the base-line absorbance to obtain the best linear fit of lnA versus r 2(A, absorption; r, radial distance). In all cases, a partial specific volume of V = 0.73 cm3/g2 and a buffer density of ρ = 1.005 g/cm3. CD spectra were recorded on a Cary 61 spectropolarimeter at 20 °C. For far UV CD (250–195 nm), thermostated quartz cells of 0.1 or 0.2 cm path length were used. Mean residue ellipticity values ([Q]MRW) were calculated (22Schmid F.X. Creighton T.E. Protein Structure: A Practical Approach. Oxford IRL Press, Oxford1989: 251-285Google Scholar) by using the expression: [Q]MRW = (Q × 100 ×M r)/(c × d ×Naa) (degrees cm2 dmol−1), whereQ is the measured ellipticity in degrees, c is the protein concentration in mg/ml, d is the path length in cm, M r is the relative molecular mass, and Naa is the number of amino acids per protein. Synthesized peptides were lyophilized and resuspended at a concentration of 1 mg/ml in water. To analyze the formation of hetero-oligomers, the peptides were mixed in the presence of 1 mm reduced glutathione in 200 mm Tris, pH 7.5 or 8.8, 200 mm NaCl, and 1 mm EDTA, heated to 37 °C for 10 min., and then cooled to 4 °C on ice. The samples were prewarmed at the appropriate temperature for 5 min prior to oxidation by the addition of 10 mm oxidized glutathione. The free cysteines were blocked by the addition of 100 mm iodoacetamide for 15 min at the same temperature. Products were analyzed by Tricine-SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (20Schägger H. von Jagow G. Anal. Biochem. 1987; 166: 368-379Crossref PubMed Scopus (10480) Google Scholar) and visualized by Coomassie Blue staining. The cross-linking was performed in 20 mm sodium phosphate buffer, 150 mm NaCl, pH 7 (phosphate-buffered saline) at a concentration of 0.2 mg/ml with 5 mm or 10 mm of sulfo-GMBS for 2 h at 4 °C according to the manufacturer's protocol (Pierce). Products were analyzed by Tricine-SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis as described before. Cross-linking of the ORF II product of RTBV was done with 5 mm bis-2-sulfosuccinimidooxycarbonyloxyethyl sulfone using the same procedure (Pierce). The ORF III coiled-coil tetramer was modeled using the computer graphics program TURBO-FRODO (23Roussel, A., and Inisan, A. G. (1993) TURBO-FRODO, Version 4.3, Release a, Bio-Graphics, Marseille, FranceGoogle Scholar). The crystal structure of GCN4-tetramer (24Harbury P.B. Kim P.S. Alber T. Nature. 1994; 371: 80-83Crossref PubMed Scopus (420) Google Scholar) was taken as a template for constructing the model. The structure was further refined by using X-PLOR program (25Brunger, A. T. (1992) X-PLOR: A System for X-ray Crystallography and NMR, Version 3.1, Yale University Press, New Haven, CTGoogle Scholar, 26Brooks B.R. Bruccoleri R.E. Olafson B.D. States D.J. Swaminathan S. Karplus M. J. Comp. Chem. 1993; 4: 187-217Crossref Scopus (13967) Google Scholar) using a procedure already described (27Kajava A.V. Proteins. 1996; 24: 218-226Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). Liquid chromatography interfaced with electrospray ionization-mass spectrometry was performed using a Rheos 4000 chromatograph with a Jasco 975 UV detector. The system was equipped with a Vydac C8 column (1 × 250 mm) interfaced with Sciex API 300. The mass spectrometer was equipped with an electrospray ion source. The Vydac C8 column was equilibrated in 5% solvent A (2% CH3CN, 0.05% trifluoroacetic acid) and solvent B (80% CH3CN, 0.045% trifluoroacetic acid) using a linear gradient from 5 to 60% B in 30 min at a flow rate of 50 μl/min. The ion spray voltage was 5500 V, and the gas pressure was 40 p.s.i. The mass spectrometer was operated in single quadrupole operating mode. The mass range from 300 to 2400 Da was scanned with a step size of 0.5 kDa and a dwell time of 0.75 ms. The yeast two-hybrid system (28Bartel P.L. Chien C.T. Sternglanz R. Fields S. Hartley D.A. Cellular Interactions in Development: A Practical Approach. Oxford University Press, Oxford1993: 153-179Google Scholar) was used to study the interaction of p15 with itself. The ORF III sequence of CaMV was fused in frame with the C terminus of the GAL4 DNA binding domain in the vector pGBT9 to give pGBT III and to the C terminus of the GAL4 activation domain in the vector pGAD424 to give pGAD III. The yeast reporter strain was co-transformed with the plasmids, and β-galactosidase activity could be detected less than 1 h after colony lift with 5-bromo-4-chloro-3-indolyl β-d-galactopyranoside. To map the domain of interaction, deletions were made in pGAD III (Fig. 1 A). The proteins p(1–118), p(1–82), and p(1–34), named after the corresponding amino acids of p15, harbor a C-terminal deletion and induce a β-galactosidase activity in the yeast two-hybrid system. The protein p(Δ34–107) harbors an internal deletion of 73 amino acids and does not affect the interaction with full-length p15, as seen by induction of β-galactosidase activity. However, no activity was observed if the first 33 amino acids were deleted in the protein p(34–129), suggesting that the interaction domain of p15 is located at the N terminus of the protein. Random mutagenesis was performed on the p15 gene using a modified PCR reaction with Taq polymerase. The fidelity of DNA synthesis of Taq polymerase can be altered by modification of the buffer composition. The presence of metal ions as well as altered nucleotide ratios have been shown to decrease the fidelity of DNA synthesis (19Vogel A.M. Das A. Mol. Microbiol. 1994; 12: 811-817Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar, 29Beckman R.A. Mildvan A.S. Loeb L.A. Biochemistry. 1985; 24: 5810-5817Crossref PubMed Scopus (168) Google Scholar). Following PCR mutagenesis, a bank of mutated DNA fragments encoding the p15 gene were cloned into the pGAD vector and cotransformed in yeast with the wt p15 sequence in pGBT III. Five colonies that did not show β-galactosidase activity were selected. Their plasmids were isolated and sequenced. One of the five colonies was an empty pGBT vector. The other four plasmids revealed mutations that introduced early stop codons (pM1, pM2, and pM5) or a frameshift ending at a new stop codon (pM3) (Fig. 1 B). All the mutant proteins terminated within the first 34 nucleotides, which was the minimal domain of interaction with the full-length p15 mapped in the experiment (Fig. 1 A). These mutants could probably not interact with p15 because they are too short. This result reinforces the importance of the N terminus of p15 in the protein-protein interaction. Since only mutations found close to the N terminus of p15 could influence the interaction, it is tempting to suggest that only this region is involved in the oligomerization of the protein. When expressed in Escherichia coli BL21(DE3) cells, p15 represented more than 20% of the total protein. The purified protein was analyzed by analytical ultracentrifugation to determine the quaternary structure. The calculation yielded a molecular mass of 57 kDa in 12.5 mm Tris pH 8.3 and 90 mm glycine. The sedimentation coefficient of p15 was of 2.8s 020,w. The combined analytical ultracentifugation data show that the protein is a tetramer and has a rodlike shape. The analysis of the amino acid sequence of the N terminus of p15 revealed a heptad repeat that is characteristic of a coiled-coil (Fig. 1 C). To test the ability of this region to form a coiled-coil structure, a peptide corresponding to residues 3–32 of p15 with a molecular mass of 4149 Da was synthesized. The presumptive coiled-coil sequence was preceded by the sequence GSCECKQ and called pep(wt) (Fig. 2 A). The two cysteines were used to allow disulfide cross-linking of associated peptides. The position of the cysteines at the N terminus of pep(wt) is important to assess the orientation of the α-helices to each other in the coiled-coil. Based on the results obtained in the two-hybrid system, it was concluded that the N-terminal 34 amino acids of p15 are involved in the oligomerization of the protein. Furthermore, the analytical centrifugation showed us that p15 is a tetramer. To investigate the formation of an oligomeric structure, pep(wt) was reduced at 37 °C, slowly cooled to 4 °C and oxidized with glutathione for different times. After alkylation, the cross-linked peptide complexes were separated by electrophoresis on non-reducing SDS-polyacrylamide gels. One minute of oxidation was sufficient to cross-link the peptide into a parallel tetramer, which is the major cross-linked form observed on the gel (Fig. 2 B). Oxidation for longer periods gave similar results (Fig. 2 B). We also observed the formation of a tetramer as the highest multimer when pep(wt) was chemically cross-link with sulfo-GMBS (Fig. 2 C). The mass of the tetramer is overestimated on the SDS gel when compared with the protein markers. This could be due to the dense packing of the coiled-coil making it resistant to complete denaturation by SDS, thus causing retardation of the protein in the gel because less SDS is bound to it. To assess the formation of a coiled-coil, the secondary structure of the peptide was examined by CD spectroscopy. The spectrum, recorded at 20 °C in 200 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 200 mm NaCl, and 1 mm EDTA at a concentration of 0.5 mg/ml, displayed minima around 208 and 222 nm, characteristic for an α-helical structure (Fig. 3 A). The purified tetramer of p15 was also analyzed by CD spectroscopy. The protein showed a typical α-helical spectrum (Fig. 3 B) with two minima, at 208 and 222 nm. The calculation predicts an α-helix content of 65%, 27% random coil, and 8% β-turn. Because of the discrepancy in apparent molecular weight on the gel, we verified the oligomerization state by mass spectrometry. The cross-linked pep(wt) was applied to a reverse phase high performance liquid chromatography interfaced with an electrospray ionization mass spectrometer. The spectrum of peak A (Fig. 4 A) showed a mass of 16,585 Da corresponding to the tetramer form with 8 oxidized Cys. Peak B, with a mass of 4759 Da, corresponded to the monomer, taking into account the two attached glutathione on the Cys, and peak C with a mass of 8293 Da corresponds to the dimer with 4 oxidized cysteines. The trimer form was previously found as the least abundant form of oligomers on the SDS-polyacrylamide gel (Fig. 4 A). The trimer was not detected with the liquid chromatography-electrospray ionization mass spectrometer. A helical wheel representation of the coiled-coil of p15 (Fig. 4 B) highlights the importance of the hydrophobic residues in the formation of the stalk and the contribution of the electrostatic interaction between Lys22 and Asp24 in position “e” and “g,” respectively, for the stability of the tetrameric coiled-coil. The hydrophobic residues Leu29 and Leu31 could also contribute to the stability of the stalk. To discard the possibility of an artifact caused by the oxydative cross-linking of pep(wt), the homogeneity of the oligomer of the reduced pep(wt) was verified in native condition by gel filtration on a Sephadex G-50 medium (Pharmacia). Two globular proteins with molecular masses of 25 kDa (chymotrypsinogen A) and 12.4 kDa (cytochrome C) were used as controls. The stalked peptide, assembled as a tetramer (16.585 kDa), was exclusively eluting together with the chymotrypsinogen A (25 kDa) fractions (Fig. 5). To verify the level of oligomerization of the eluted peptide, fraction 9 was oxidized for 10 min with glutathione at 4 °C prior to denaturing and loading on the SDS-PAGE. As expected, a major band corresponding to the parallel tetramer was detected (Fig. 5). We think that the overestimation of the mass of the tetramer by gel filtration is due to the rod-shaped structure of the coiled-coil that increased its migration through the beads as compared with a globular protein. Asp24 in position “e” and Lys22 in position “g” are facing each other and could be involved in an electrostatic interaction that stabilizes the tetramer or even determines its oligomerization state (17Beck K. Gambee J.E. Kamawal A. Bächinger H.P. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 3767-3777Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). To verify this hypothesis, we synthesized a mutant peptide, pep(K22N). At 4 °C, this mutant assembled like pep(wt) (Fig. 6). However, when the oxidation and the alkylation of pep(K22N) was performed at 42 or 65 °C, the formation of the tetramer was clearly reduced and the formation of dimers increased (Fig. 6). Mutation of Lys22 to Asp impaired considerably the formation of the tetramer at 4 °C (Fig. 6). In this case, the tetramer almost completely disappeared and more dimers and monomers could be detected. The formation of α-helical coiled-coil structures is a common mechanism of protein subunit assembly. Well characterized examples are myosin, intermediate filaments, laminin, and transcription factors (30Chew M.W. Squire J.M. J. Struct. Biol. 1995; 115: 233-249Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar, 31North A.C.T. Steinert P.M. Parry D.A.D. Proteins. 1994; 20: 174-1843Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar, 32Hunter I. Schulthess T. Engel J. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 6006-6011Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The ORF III product of CaMV (p15) contains a heptad repeat at its N terminus, typical of a coiled-coil domain. Using the yeast two-hybrid system, we showed that the first 33 amino acids of p15 are sufficient to allow oligomerization of the full-length p15. Oxidative and chemical cross-linking of the stalk peptides (pep(wt)), comprising amino acids 3–32 of p15, could form a parallel tetramer as shown by SDS-PAGE and mass spectroscopy. Finally, the CD spectrum of pep(wt) confirmed the α-helical structure of the tetramer. The homogeneity of the oligomer of the reduced pep(wt) was verified by gel filtration, suggesting that the peptide is found uniquely as a tetramer in solution. p15 is a thermostable protein as evidenced by the purification protocol (see “Experimental Procedures”). Electrostatic interactions have been shown to improve thermal stability in coiled-coils (17Beck K. Gambee J.E. Kamawal A. Bächinger H.P. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 3767-3777Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). The mutation K22N decreased thermal stability. Furthermore, mutation K22D introduced a negative charge that destabilized the tetramer and favored the formation of a dimer. In a tetrameric and pentameric coiled-coil, positions “a” and “d” are substantially buried in the stalk and are close to each other; residues at the “e” and “g” positions are partially buried; residues “b,” “c,” and “f” remain completely exposed (27Kajava A.V. Proteins. 1996; 24: 218-226Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). Only dimers were observed when a negative charge was introduced at position e22 probably because the tetramer stalk cannot accommodate two negative charges in position e22 and g24. Sequence alignment of related proteins found in other caulimoviruses suggests also the presence of N-terminal coiled-coils. Thus, oligomerization of this class of proteins would seem to be important for its function (Fig. 7 A). This is supported by the observation that deletion of 20 amino acids in the coiled-coil of CaMV p15 leads to a non-infectious virus (33Jacquot E. Geldreich A. Keller M. Yot P. Virology. 1998; 242: 395-402Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). As shown in studies of GCN4 leucine zipper mutants, the “a” and “d” positions exhibit preferences for leucine and isoleucine, respectively, in a tetrameric coiled-coil (12Harbury P.B. Zhang T. Kim P.S. Alber T. Science. 1993; 262: 1401-1407Crossref PubMed Scopus (1338) Google Scholar). The coiled-coil domain of p15 shows no strong bias for leucine at the “a” position, while the “d” position, as in the case of the GCN4-tetramer, is occupied by apolar Cβ-branched residues (mostly Ile). This provides additional support for the idea that the isoleucine at “d” position can favor coiled-coil tetramerization. To visualize the spatial arrangement of the ORF III product tetramer, a model of the three-dimensional structure was developed (Fig. 8 A). The data and the modeling suggest that Asp24 can interact simultaneously with both Lys22 and Lys26. The modeling also suggests that the p15 tetramer has two interhelical salt bridges between charged side chains at the “g” and “b” positions (Asp17-Lys19, Asp24-Lys26) (Fig. 8 A). This type of ion pair was also found in the crystal structure of the four-stranded coiled-coil of GCN4 (12Harbury P.B. Zhang T. Kim P.S. Alber T. Science. 1993; 262: 1401-1407Crossref PubMed Scopus (1338) Google Scholar) and can provide for an additional interaction favoring the tetramerization of p15. A hydrophobic interaction between Leu29 and Leu31 of CaMV p15 in position “e” and “g” could also contribute to the stability of this complex.Figure 8A, stereo view of a modeled structure of the ORF III coiled-coil domain. Negatively and positively charged side chains are in red and blue, polar and apolar side chains are in green and black, and the disulfide-bonded cysteines are in yellow. Ionic bonds between the side chains are denoted by dotted lines. This figure as well as Fig. 2 were generated with the program MOLSCRIPT (37Kraulis P.J. J. Appl. Crystallogr. 1991; 24: 946-950Crossref Google Scholar). B, axial projection of the tetramer model looking from the C terminus. The projection shows the specific network of hydrogen bonds between glutamines 18 (shown by a ball-and-stick representation) in a tetramer arrangement.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Charged residues are found in the e22 position of the ORF III product of all the aligned caulimovirus (Fig. 7 A). This charge is compensated by an opposite charge in position g24and b26 in carnation etched ring virus, and in g24 for strawberry vein banding virus. For soybean chlorotic mottle virus, the electrostatic bridge is found at positions e17 and g19 between a Glu and an Arg residue. Furthermore, because of the rather close proximity of the “b” and “c” positions in a tetramer stalk (11Kammerer R.A. Matrix Biol. 1997; 15: 555-565Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar), it is possible that the soybean chlorotic mottle virus couples Asp7-Arg8 and Lys21-Glu22 and the figwort mosaic virus couple Glu27 and Arg28 also contribute to the stability of the pIII coiled-coils by forming salt bridges. Badnaviruses have a genomic organization related to the one of caulimoviruses. ORF II of badnaviruses has been suggested to be the homologue of the ORF III of caulimoviruses based on sequence homology and function of their C-terminal nucleic acid binding domain (7Jacquot E. Keller M. Yot P. Virology. 1997; 239: 352-359Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). We could also find a putative coiled-coil domain in the ORF II of the badnavirus RTBV in the middle of the protein (Fig. 7 B). The purification and chemical cross-linking of the ORF II product showed that also this protein oligomerizes as a tetramer (data not shown). It is tempting to extrapolate this feature to the other badnavirus (Fig. 7 B). The putative coiled-coil of CoYMV shows some residues of the same charge in positions b57 and c58, and b64 and c65, respectively. This arrangement would destabilize the tetrameric coiled-coil; however, the virus might have compensated this deficiency by an increase in length of the coiled coil structure. We can also find putative salt bridges between the couples e58-g60 and e65-g67 in the sugarcane bacilliform virus, b55-c56 in cacao swollen shoot virus, e60-g62 in the RTBV and e67-g69 in CoYMV coiled-coil. Potential hydrophobic stabilizing interactions are found between positions e46 and g48 in the CoYMV, and between positions e51 and g53 in the sugarcane bacilliform virus coiled-coils. All the coiled-coils presented in Fig. 7 (A and B), with the exception of RTBV, which has the smallest coiled-coil, are interrupted once with a Gln or Thr in position “a” or “d” in the stalk of the multimer. This seems to be a common feature of other coiled-coils, and the nature of this phenomenon is not understood. The assembly domain of cartilage oligomeric matrix protein forms a homo-pentamer coiled-coil with a conserved Gln in the interior “d” position. The substitution of this residue for Leu improved the thermal stability of the coiled-coil and did not lead to any difference in the assembly of the multimer (34Terskikh A.V. Potekhin S.A. Melnik T.N. Kajava A.V. Lett. Pept. Sci. 1997; 4: 297-304Google Scholar). It is possible that nature favors the presence of a Gln or Thr in this position to allow protein turnover in the cell (34Terskikh A.V. Potekhin S.A. Melnik T.N. Kajava A.V. Lett. Pept. Sci. 1997; 4: 297-304Google Scholar). The tetramer structure has a continuous central channel with a radius that varies from 1.0 to 1.3 Å. The radius of the pore excludes a 1.4-Å radius of a water molecule probe or an anion, for example chloride, which was found in a pentameric coiled-coil (35Malashkevich V.N. Kammerer R.A. Efimov V.P. Schulthess T. Engel J. Science. 1996; 274: 761Crossref PubMed Scopus (269) Google Scholar). However, the oxygen atoms of Gln18, in the CaMV p15 coiled-coil, could form hydrogen bounds in the stalk and possibly provide a higher specificity for a parallel coiled-coil structure (Fig. 8 B) (34Terskikh A.V. Potekhin S.A. Melnik T.N. Kajava A.V. Lett. Pept. Sci. 1997; 4: 297-304Google Scholar). The coefficient of sedimentation and the evidences brought by the oxidative and chemical cross-linking as well as the gel filtration of pep(wt) suggest that the protein adopts a rodlike structure presenting the C-terminal functional domain. The C terminus is likely to be important for the function since a deletion of the last 5 amino acids of the protein completely abolishes the viability of the virus (33Jacquot E. Geldreich A. Keller M. Yot P. Virology. 1998; 242: 395-402Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). The rod-shaped structure of the coiled-coil probably extends to the two central Cys residues (Cys64 and Cys66) because of an extension of the amphipathic α-helix (Fig. 1 C). The amino acid sequence after those two Cys is rich in the α-helix breakers Gly and Pro. This region of the protein probably serves as a hinge, providing the space necessary for the C-terminal domain to bind nucleic acids (4Mougeot J.L. Guidasci T. Wurch T. Lebeurier G. Mesnard J.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 1470-1498Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). The tetramerization of p15 through a coiled-coil domain can improve its binding affinity for nucleic acid (36Terskikh A.V. Le Doussal J.M. Crameri R. Fisch I. Mach J.-P. Kajava A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 1663-1668Crossref PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar), because it links together identical subunits which enhance the affinity for the substrate. Furthermore, this feature might be important to modify the structure of the viral genomic DNA prior to assembly (4Mougeot J.L. Guidasci T. Wurch T. Lebeurier G. Mesnard J.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 1470-1498Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). It is not excluded that the tetramerization of p15 could also play a role in the specificity of recognition of nucleic acids.

Kirschner for the supply of the CD spectra spectrophotometer and to Renate Mattis for technical assistance."
https://openalex.org/W1967187871,"γ-Aminobutyric acid, type A (GABAA) receptors, the major inhibitory neurotransmitter receptors in the central nervous system, are heteropentameric proteins assembled from distinct subunit classes with multiple subtypes, α(1–6), β(1–4), γ(1–3), δ(1), and ε(1). To examine the process of receptor assembly and targeting, we tagged the carboxyl terminus of the GABAA receptor α1 subunit with red-shifted enhanced green fluorescent protein (EGFP). Xenopus oocytes were injected with cRNA of this fusion protein, α1-EGFP, alone or in combination with cRNA of GABAA receptor β2, γ2, or β2+γ2 subunits. Within 72 h after injection, EGFP fluorescence was visible in all fusion protein-injected cells. The fluorescence was associated with the plasmalemma only when the β2 subunit was co-injected with α1-EGFP. Texas Red-conjugated immunolabeling of EGFP on nonpermeabilized cells demonstrated that EGFP was localized extracellularly. Hence, the COOH terminus of the α1subunit is extracellular. Two-electrode voltage clamp of α1-EGFPβ2- and α1-EGFPβ2γ2-injected oocytes demonstrates that these cells express functional receptors, with EC50 values for GABA and diazepam similar to wild-type receptors. Thus, a COOH-terminal tag of the α1 subunit appears to be functionally silent, providing a useful marker for studies of GABAA receptor expression, assembly, transport, targeting, and clustering.

GABAA1receptors are the major inhibitory neurotransmitter receptors in the mammalian brain and are members of a ligand-gated ion channel superfamily (1Ortells M.O. Lunt G.G. Trends Neurosci. 1995; 18: 121-127Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (467) Google Scholar), which includes receptors for acetylcholine, glycine, and serotonin. The native GABAA receptor is likely to be a heteropentameric protein (2Nayeem N. Green T.P. Martin I.L. Barnard E.A. J. Neurochem. 1994; 62: 815-818Crossref PubMed Scopus (376) Google Scholar) assembled from several different classes and isoforms of GABAA receptor subunits, including 6α, 4β, 3γ, 1δ and 1ε subunit subtypes (3Sieghart W. Pharmacol. Rev. 1995; 47: 181-234PubMed Google Scholar, 4Rabow L.E. Russek S.J. Farb D.H. Synapse. 1995; 21: 189-274Crossref PubMed Scopus (457) Google Scholar, 5Davies P.A. Hanna M.C. Hales T.G.

Hydropathy plots of the sequences of all the subunits predict an extracellular NH2-terminal domain of about 200 amino acids, four putative membrane-spanning domains, referred to as M1, M2, M3, and M4, a cytoplasmic domain of variable length between M3 and M4, and an extracellular carboxyl terminus. Theoretically, a large number of different pentameric subunit combinations derived from the various subunit subtypes can be present in the brain. Localization of the GABAA receptor gene products, including mRNA byin situ hybridization and polypeptides by immunocytochemistry, has revealed that the various subunits and subunit subtypes show different regional as well as developmental distributions (7Wisden W.

Seeburg P.H. Curr. Opin. Neurobiol. 1992; 2: 263-269Crossref PubMed Scopus (234) Google Scholar, 13Wisden W. Korpi E.R. Bahn S. Neuropharmacology. 1996; 35: 1139-1160Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar). GABAA receptors consisting of different subunit isoforms are most likely responsible for the diversity of inhibitory synaptic responses observed in some regions of the brain, and it is possible that different types of GABAA receptors are present even within single neurons (14Nusser Z. Sieghart W. Somogyi P. J. Neurosci. 1998; 18: 1693-1703Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Thus, elucidating the cellular and molecular mechanisms involved in the regulation of the assembly, membrane targeting and subcellular distribution of GABAA receptors is important for ultimately understanding how neurons control their fast inhibitory responses.In general, antibody labeling of receptors has been used to study receptor trafficking and localization. This approach, however, can be labor intensive and is generally not useful for monitoring receptors in intracellular compartments. More recently, green fluorescent protein (GFP) from the jellyfish Aequorea victoria has been used in a variety of studies to examine gene expression and protein subcellular localization (15Marshall J. Molloy R. Moss G.W. Howe J.R. Hughes T.E. Neuron. 1995; 14: 211-215Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (219) Google Scholar, 16Barak L.S. Ferguson S.S. Zhang J. Martenson C. Meyer T. Caron M.G. Mol.

A. 1998; 95: 1903-1908Crossref PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar). GFP is particularly useful because it fluoresces in living cells without requiring additional reagents or cofactors, and its fluorescence is resistant to photobleaching. GFP has been used successfully as a protein tag on both the amino and carboxyl termini of a wide range of cytosolic and membrane-bound proteins (for review, see Cubitt et al. (18Cubitt A.B. Heim R. Adams S.R. Boyd A.E. Gross L.A. Tsien R.Y. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1995; 20: 448-455Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1193) Google Scholar)) and provides a way to directly measure levels of protein expression, to visually identify cells expressing the protein, and to localize the protein as it is being processed.To specifically examine GABAA receptor expression, assembly and membrane targeting, we attached red-shifted GFP (EGFP,CLONTECH) to the COOH terminus of the GABAA receptor α1 subunit. This fusion protein, α1-EGFP, was expressed in Xenopusoocytes alone or with β2, γ2, or β2+γ2 GABAA receptor subunit combinations. Oocytes expressing the fusion protein are clearly fluorescent and show distinct patterns of fluorescence, depending on the subunits coinjected. Voltage clamp studies provide evidence that the fusion protein forms a functional channel when coexpressed with β2 or β2γ2 subunits, and that the GFP tag is functionally silent. In addition, GFP immunolabeling on nonpermeabilized cells provides direct experimental evidence that the COOH terminus of the α1 subunit is extracellular, consistent with the four-transmembrane subunit topology model based on hydrophobicity analysis.DISCUSSIONBecause the response properties of neurons are ultimately controlled by the types of ion channels and neurotransmitter receptors present at a particular synapse, a fundamental question in neurobiology is to understand the regulation and the processes involved in the assembly, expression, and subcellular targeting of these proteins. Since GABAA receptors are heteropentameric proteins assembled from five distinct subunit classes with multiple subtypes, this question is particularly complex (22Wisden W. Moss S.J. Biochem. Soc. Trans. 1997; 25: 820-824Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar). To address this, we created a fusion protein of the GABAA receptor α1subunit with a naturally fluorescent protein, EGFP. We then characterized α1-EGFP expression in Xenopusoocytes, alone or with other receptor subunit combinations, using microscopic, immunological, and electrophysiological techniques. Attachment of GFP to a protein allows rapid, noninvasive detection of the tagged protein in living cells and provides a powerful tool for studying protein trafficking. Ideally, the labeled protein should be relatively unperturbed by its fluorescent tag and exhibit little or no change in its behavior.Attachment of EGFP to the COOH terminus of the GABAAreceptor α1 subunit produces a bright green fluorescent protein when expressed in Xenopus oocytes. When expressed alone or in combination with the γ2 subunit, α1-EGFP shows a generalized fluorescence, which is distributed throughout the cell (Fig. 1). Immunolabeling with an anti-GFP antibody and Texas Red established that when expressed alone or with γ2, the location of the α1-EGFP fluorescence is intracellular. Thus, neither α1-EGFP nor α1-EGFPγ2 is transported to the cell surface. Heterologous expression of single and multiple combinations of different GABAA receptor subunits and the subsequent formation of functional surface receptors has proven controversial. Homomeric expression of α1 and β2 subunits produces functional surface receptor expression in some reports (23Blair L.A. Levitan E.S. Marshall J. Dionne V.E. Barnard E.A. Science. 1988; 242: 577-579Crossref PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar) but not in others (24Sigel E. Baur R. Trube G. Mohler H. Malherbe P.

Chem. 1996; 271: 89-96Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (289) Google Scholar). Similarly, expression of binary combinations of subunits (e.g. αγ and βγ) have produced functional receptors in some cases (26Draguhn A. Verdorn T.A. Ewert M. Seeburg P.H. Sakmann B. Neuron. 1990; 5: 781-788Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (350) Google Scholar, 27Verdoorn T.A. Draguhn A. Ymer S. Seeburg P.H. Sakmann B.

Chem. 1996; 271: 89-96Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (289) Google Scholar). Our results provide evidence that α1 subunits are not localized to nor inserted into the surface membrane in oocytes expressing α1 subunits alone or α1 + γ2 subunits. The inability of α1 and α1γ2 subunit combinations to reach the cell surface may reflect the inability of these subunits to oligomerize into pentameric receptors.When expressed with β2 or β2γ2 subunits, α1-EGFP is targeted to the surface membrane (Fig. 1). Electrophysiological analyses show that the α1-EGFP fusion protein forms functional GABAA receptor channels when coexpressed with β2 or β2γ2 subunits, with EC50 values for both GABA and diazepam similar to wild-type receptors (Figs. 4 and 5), confirming a surface membrane localization. In addition, these results indicate that the GABAA receptor β2 subunit is required for translocation of α1-EGFP to the surface plasmalemma, and most likely plays an important role in both functional pentameric receptor assembly as well as membrane targeting.GABAA receptor targeting studies, carried out in polarized Madin-Darby canine kidney cells, have mixed results. One study (28Perez-Velazquez J.L. Angelides K.J. Nature. 1993; 361: 457-460Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar) demonstrated that α1 subunits expressed alone were targeted to the basolateral membrane and β1 subunits expressed alone to the apical membrane. Coexpression of α1 and β1 targeted both subunits to the apical membrane. Thus, even though both α1 and β1 subunits are capable of being subcellularly targeted, the β1 subunit when present regulates the targeting of the α1 subunit. In contrast, Connolly et al. (29Connolly C.N. Wooltorton J.R. Smart T.G. Moss S.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 9899-9904Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar) showed that α1β1 coexpression in Madin-Darby canine kidney cells resulted in a nonpolarized surface distribution, and neither α1 nor β1subunits expressed alone were inserted into any surface membrane. In the same study, α1β2 coexpression resulted in a basolateral surface distribution, and α1β3 in an apical distribution which switched to a basolateral distribution over time. Thus, while it appears that the type of β subunit may guide membrane targeting, it is less clear if it is a required element. In our study, we show that α1 subunits expressed alone are not targeted to nor inserted into the oocyte surface membrane and that the β2subunit is required for targeting and assembling the α1subunit into a functional cell surface receptor.The transmembrane topology of a GABAA receptor subunit is predicted by hydrophobicity analysis to have an extracellular NH2-terminal domain, four putative membrane-spanning domains, and an extracellular COOH terminus (30Schofield P.R. Darlison M.G. Fujita N. Burt D.R. Stephenson F.A. Rodriguez H. Rhee L.M. Ramachandran J. Reale V. Glencorse T.A. Seeburg P.H. Barnard E.A. Nature. 1987; 328: 221-227Crossref PubMed Scopus (1261) Google Scholar). Experimental support of this model is not well established for the GABAAreceptor family, and as demonstrated for the ionotropic glutamate receptor family (15Marshall J. Molloy R. Moss G.W. Howe J.R.

Neuron. 1994; 13: 1331-1343Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (382) Google Scholar), hydrophobicity analysis is not always correct. For GABAA receptor subunits, the extracellular placement of the amino-terminal end of the subunit has been verified by antibody labeling of intact cells (25Connolly C.N. Krishek B.J. McDonald B.J. Smart T.G. Moss S.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 89-96Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (289) Google Scholar) and mutagenesis of glycosylation sites (32Buller A.L. Hastings G.A.

In this study, since EGFP is fused to the carboxyl terminus of the α1 subunit, GFP immunocytochemical labeling of nonpermeabilized oocytes expressing α1-EGFPβ2 or α1-EGFPβ2γ2receptors provides direct evidence that the COOH terminus of the α1 subunit is extracellular (Fig. 3). Our results lend further support for the four-transmembrane subunit topology model.The stoichoimetry of recombinant GABAA receptors is most likely 2α,2β,1γ or 3α,2β subunits (35Im W.B. Pregenzer J.F. Binder J.A. Dillon G.H. Alberts G.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 26063-26066Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar, 36Chang Y. Wang R. Barot S. Weiss D.S. J.

Thus, α1-EGFP-containing receptors presumably have two to three EGFP tags per receptor. Surprisingly, the EGFP tag is functionally silent even though it is much larger than most protein tags and, at 238 amino acid residues, is approximately half the size of a GABAA receptor subunit. Despite this, the addition of this relatively large protein to the COOH terminus of the α1subunit does not appear to interfere or alter subunit folding, oligomeric assembly, membrane targeting, or the physiological properties of the receptor. Since attachment of EGFP has no obvious effect on the receptor, we speculate that the COOH-terminal regions and the adjacent M4 transmembrane regions of the α1 subunits are relatively far apart from each other in a receptor complex and are presumably not involved in agonist-induced conformational changes in the receptor. The lack of change in EGFP fluorescent emission measured during GABA activation of α1-EGFPβ2γ2 receptors is consistent with this hypothesis.Taken together, our data unequivocally demonstrate that COOH-terminal tagging of the α1 subunit of the GABAAreceptor with EGFP yields fully functional ion channels in Xenopus oocytes when expressed with β2 or β2γ2 subunits. Our results provide evidence for the importance of the β2 subunit in efficient functional receptor assembly, expression and targeting to the surface plasmalemma. In addition, we provide the first direct experimental evidence that the COOH terminus of the α1 subunit is extracellular. This is the first report of successfully tagging GFP to a member of the ligand-gated ion channel superfamily, which includes neuronal and muscle nicotinic acetylcholine receptors, GABAA receptors, glycine receptors, and serotonin receptors and establishes the general usefulness of this approach for studying their assembly, transport, targeting, and clustering. It should now be possible to identify specific regions of the receptor essential for these processes by using GFP-tagged subunit chimeras. GABAA1receptors are the major inhibitory neurotransmitter receptors in the mammalian brain and are members of a ligand-gated ion channel superfamily (1Ortells M.O. Lunt G.G. Trends Neurosci. 1995; 18: 121-127Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (467) Google Scholar), which includes receptors for acetylcholine, glycine, and serotonin. The native GABAA receptor is likely to be a heteropentameric protein (2Nayeem N. Green T.P. Martin I.L. Barnard E.A. J. Neurochem. 1994; 62: 815-818Crossref PubMed Scopus (376) Google Scholar) assembled from several different classes and isoforms of GABAA receptor subunits, including 6α, 4β, 3γ, 1δ and 1ε subunit subtypes (3Sieghart W. Pharmacol. Rev. 1995; 47: 181-234PubMed Google Scholar, 4Rabow L.E. Russek S.J. Farb D.H. Synapse. 1995; 21: 189-274Crossref PubMed Scopus (457) Google Scholar, 5Davies P.A. Hanna M.C. Hales T.G.

Chem. 1997; 272: 15346-15350Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (195) Google Scholar). Hydropathy plots of the sequences of all the subunits predict an extracellular NH2-terminal domain of about 200 amino acids, four putative membrane-spanning domains, referred to as M1, M2, M3, and M4, a cytoplasmic domain of variable length between M3 and M4, and an extracellular carboxyl terminus. Theoretically, a large number of different pentameric subunit combinations derived from the various subunit subtypes can be present in the brain. Localization of the GABAA receptor gene products, including mRNA byin situ hybridization and polypeptides by immunocytochemistry, has revealed that the various subunits and subunit subtypes show different regional as well as developmental distributions (7Wisden W.

Neuropharmacology. 1996; 35: 1139-1160Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar). GABAA receptors consisting of different subunit isoforms are most likely responsible for the diversity of inhibitory synaptic responses observed in some regions of the brain, and it is possible that different types of GABAA receptors are present even within single neurons (14Nusser Z. Sieghart W. Somogyi P. J. Neurosci. 1998; 18: 1693-1703Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Thus, elucidating the cellular and molecular mechanisms involved in the regulation of the assembly, membrane targeting and subcellular distribution of GABAA receptors is important for ultimately understanding how neurons control their fast inhibitory responses. In general, antibody labeling of receptors has been used to study receptor trafficking and localization. This approach, however, can be labor intensive and is generally not useful for monitoring receptors in intracellular compartments. More recently, green fluorescent protein (GFP) from the jellyfish Aequorea victoria has been used in a variety of studies to examine gene expression and protein subcellular localization (15Marshall J. Molloy R. Moss G.W. Howe J.R. Hughes T.E. Neuron. 1995; 14: 211-215Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (219) Google Scholar, 16Barak L.S. Ferguson S.S. Zhang J. Martenson C. Meyer T. Caron M.G. Mol. Pharmacol. 1997; 51: 177-184Crossref PubMed Scopus (201) Google Scholar, 17Grabner M. Dirksen R.T. Beam K.G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 1903-1908Crossref PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar). GFP is particularly useful because it fluoresces in living cells without requiring additional reagents or cofactors, and its fluorescence is resistant to photobleaching. GFP has been used successfully as a protein tag on both the amino and carboxyl termini of a wide range of cytosolic and membrane-bound proteins (for review, see Cubitt et al. (18Cubitt A.B. Heim R. Adams S.R. Boyd A.E. Gross L.A. Tsien R.Y. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1995; 20: 448-455Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1193) Google Scholar)) and provides a way to directly measure levels of protein expression, to visually identify cells expressing the protein, and to localize the protein as it is being processed. To specifically examine GABAA receptor expression, assembly and membrane targeting, we attached red-shifted GFP (EGFP,CLONTECH) to the COOH terminus of the GABAA receptor α1 subunit. This fusion protein, α1-EGFP, was expressed in Xenopusoocytes alone or with β2, γ2, or β2+γ2 GABAA receptor subunit combinations. Oocytes expressing the fusion protein are clearly fluorescent and show distinct patterns of fluorescence, depending on the subunits coinjected. Voltage clamp studies provide evidence that the fusion protein forms a functional channel when coexpressed with β2 or β2γ2 subunits, and that the GFP tag is functionally silent. In addition, GFP immunolabeling on nonpermeabilized cells provides direct experimental evidence that the COOH terminus of the α1 subunit is extracellular, consistent with the four-transmembrane subunit topology model based on hydrophobicity analysis. DISCUSSIONBecause the response properties of neurons are ultimately controlled by the types of ion channels and neurotransmitter receptors present at a particular synapse, a fundamental question in neurobiology is to understand the regulation and the processes involved in the assembly, expression, and subcellular targeting of these proteins. Since GABAA receptors are heteropentameric proteins assembled from five distinct subunit classes with multiple subtypes, this question is particularly complex (22Wisden W. Moss S.J. Biochem. Soc. Trans. 1997; 25: 820-824Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar). To address this, we created a fusion protein of the GABAA receptor α1subunit with a naturally fluorescent protein, EGFP. We then characterized α1-EGFP expression in Xenopusoocytes, alone or with other receptor subunit combinations, using microscopic, immunological, and electrophysiological techniques. Attachment of GFP to a protein allows rapid, noninvasive detection of the tagged protein in living cells and provides a powerful tool for studying protein trafficking. Ideally, the labeled protein should be relatively unperturbed by its fluorescent tag and exhibit little or no change in its behavior.Attachment of EGFP to the COOH terminus of the GABAAreceptor α1 subunit produces a bright green fluorescent protein when expressed in Xenopus oocytes. When expressed alone or in combination with the γ2 subunit, α1-EGFP shows a generalized fluorescence, which is distributed throughout the cell (Fig. 1). Immunolabeling with an anti-GFP antibody and Texas Red established that when expressed alone or with γ2, the location of the α1-EGFP fluorescence is intracellular. Thus, neither α1-EGFP nor α1-EGFPγ2 is transported to the cell surface. Heterologous expression of single and multiple combinations of different GABAA receptor subunits and the subsequent formation of functional surface receptors has proven controversial. Homomeric expression of α1 and β2 subunits produces functional surface receptor expression in some reports (23Blair L.A. Levitan E.S. Marshall J. Dionne V.E. Barnard E.A. Science. 1988; 242: 577-579Crossref PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar) but not in others (24Sigel E. Baur R. Trube G. Mohler H. Malherbe P.

Chem. 1996; 271: 89-96Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (289) Google Scholar). Similarly, expression of binary combinations of subunits (e.g. αγ and βγ) have produced functional receptors in some cases (26Draguhn A. Verdorn T.A. Ewert M. Seeburg P.H. Sakmann B. Neuron. 1990; 5: 781-788Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (350) Google Scholar, 27Verdoorn T.A. Draguhn A. Ymer S. Seeburg P.H. Sakmann B.

Chem. 1996; 271: 89-96Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (289) Google Scholar). Our results provide evidence that α1 subunits are not localized to nor inserted into the surface membrane in oocytes expressing α1 subunits alone or α1 + γ2 subunits. The inability of α1 and α1γ2 subunit combinations to reach the cell surface may reflect the inability of these subunits to oligomerize into pentameric receptors.When expressed with β2 or β2γ2 subunits, α1-EGFP is targeted to the surface membrane (Fig. 1). Electrophysiological analyses show that the α1-EGFP fusion protein forms functional GABAA receptor channels when coexpressed with β2 or β2γ2 subunits, with EC50 values for both GABA and diazepam similar to wild-type receptors (Figs. 4 and 5), confirming a surface membrane localization. In addition, these results indicate that the GABAA receptor β2 subunit is required for translocation of α1-EGFP to the surface plasmalemma, and most likely plays an important role in both functional pentameric receptor assembly as well as membrane targeting.GABAA receptor targeting studies, carried out in polarized Madin-Darby canine kidney cells, have mixed results. One study (28Perez-Velazquez J.L. Angelides K.J. Nature. 1993; 361: 457-460Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar) demonstrated that α1 subunits expressed alone were targeted to the basolateral membrane and β1 subunits expressed alone to the apical membrane. Coexpression of α1 and β1 targeted both subunits to the apical membrane. Thus, even though both α1 and β1 subunits are capable of being subcellularly targeted, the β1 subunit when present regulates the targeting of the α1 subunit. In contrast, Connolly et al. (29Connolly C.N. Wooltorton J.R. Smart T.G. Moss S.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 9899-9904Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar) showed that α1β1 coexpression in Madin-Darby canine kidney cells resulted in a nonpolarized surface distribution, and neither α1 nor β1subunits expressed alone were inserted into any surface membrane. In the same study, α1β2 coexpression resulted in a basolateral surface distribution, and α1β3 in an apical distribution which switched to a basolateral distribution over time. Thus, while it appears that the type of β subunit may guide membrane targeting, it is less clear if it is a required element. In our study, we show that α1 subunits expressed alone are not targeted to nor inserted into the oocyte surface membrane and that the β2subunit is required for targeting and assembling the α1subunit into a functional cell surface receptor.The transmembrane topology of a GABAA receptor subunit is predicted by hydrophobicity analysis to have an extracellular NH2-terminal domain, four putative membrane-spanning domains, and an extracellular COOH terminus (30Schofield P.R.

Experimental support of this model is not well established for the GABAAreceptor family, and as demonstrated for the ionotropic glutamate receptor family (15Marshall J. Molloy R. Moss G.W. Howe J.R.

In this study, human breast cancer cells were treated withcis-diamminedichloroplatinum to cross-link protein to nuclear DNA in situ, and proteins bound to DNA were isolated. We show that cytokeratins 8, 18, and 19 of T-47D5 and T5-PRF were associated with nuclear DNA in situ. The levels of the cytokeratins 8, 18, and 19 bound to nuclear DNA or associated with the cytoskeleton of T-47D5 human breast cancer cells decreased when estrogens were depleted or the pure antiestrogen ICI 164,384 was added. In contrast, the cytokeratin levels associated with nuclear DNA or cytoskeleton were not significantly affected by estrogen withdrawal or antiestrogen administration in T5-PRF cells. These observations suggest that estrogen regulates the organization of nuclear DNA by rearrangement of the cytokeratin filament network in hormone-dependent, ER-positive human breast cancer cells and that this regulation is lost in hormone-independent, ER-positive breast cancer cells. In a previous study we showed that the levels of the intermediate filament proteins, cytokeratins 8, 18, and 19, in the nuclear matrix-intermediate filament (NM-IF) fraction from the hormone-dependent and estrogen receptor (ER)-positive human breast cancer cell line T-47D5 were regulated by estrogens. In contrast, estrogens did not regulate the cytokeratins in the NM-IF fraction of the hormone-independent and ER-positive cell line, T5-PRF.

The nuclear matrix (NM),1 cytoskeleton (CSK), and extracellular matrix form the tissue matrix system, a mechanically continuous skeletal network thought to govern nuclear shape and function (1Maniotis A.J.

Cytol. 1995; 162A: 191-250PubMed Google Scholar). The NM is an RNA-protein structure that has a role in the organization and function of nuclear DNA (5Nickerson J.A. Krockmalnic G. He D.C. Penman S.

The chromatin fiber is organized into loop domains by the association of DNA sequences, called matrix-attachment regions (MARs), located at the base of the loop with NM proteins (4Davie J.R. Int.

Transcribing chromatin is also attached to the nuclear matrix by multiple dynamic attachment sites thought to be mediated by NM-bound transcription factors and histone-modifying enzymes (8McNeil S.

In eukaryotic cells, the CSK is composed of actin-containing microfilaments, tubulin-containing microtubules, and intermediate filaments, which may be composed of keratins and vimentin (12Ingber D.E. J. Cell Sci. 1993; 104: 613-627Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The NM is physically associated with the CSK through its associations with intermediate filaments, major proteins of the CSK (5Nickerson J.A. Krockmalnic G. He D.C. Penman S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 2259-2263Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar, 13Hendrix M.J.C. Cancer Metastasis Rev. 1996; 15: 413-416Crossref PubMed Scopus (4) Google Scholar, 14Penman S. Proc. Natl.

In epithelial cells and in well and poorly differentiated carcinoma cells, cytokeratins 8, 18, and 19 are the major proteins of intermediate filaments (16Oshima R.G. Baribault H. Caulin C. Cancer Metastasis Rev. 1996; 15: 445-471Crossref PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar). Intermediate filaments are dynamic structures that may transmit signals from the extracellular matrix to the nucleus (13Hendrix M.J.C. Cancer Metastasis Rev. 1996; 15: 413-416Crossref PubMed Scopus (4) Google Scholar, 14Penman S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

In an analysis of the NM-IF (nuclear matrix with associated intermediate filaments) fraction of T-47D5 human breast cancer cells (ER-positive and hormone-dependent), we identified the principal NM-IF proteins as cytokeratins 8, 18, and 19 (18Coutts A.S. Davie J.R. Dotzlaw H. Murphy L.C. J. Cell. Biochem. 1996; 63: 174-184Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). Estrogens regulated the levels of these cytokeratins in the NM-IF fraction of T-47D5 cells. When cells were grown in estrogen-depleted conditions, cytokeratin levels in NM-IF declined, but when estrogen was added back to the media, cytokeratin levels increased. In a hormone-independent, ER-positive human breast cancer cell line (T5-PRF), cytokeratins in the NM-IF were maintained at high levels regardless of whether the cells were grown in the presence or absence of estrogens (18Coutts A.S. Davie J.R. Dotzlaw H. Murphy L.C. J. Cell. Biochem. 1996; 63: 174-184Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). Furthermore, the pure antiestrogen, ICI 164,384, significantly reduced the NM-IF levels of cytokeratins 8, 18, and 19 in T-47D5 cells grown in estrogen-replete conditions, while having no effect on NM-IF levels of these proteins in the T5-PRF cell line. There is both in situ and in vitro evidence that intermediate filaments bind to nuclear DNA (19Wang X. Tolstonog G. Shoeman R.L. Traub P. DNA Cell Biol. 1996; 15: 209-225Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar, 20Ward W.S. Schmidt W.N. Schmidt C.A. Hnilica L.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

In vitro binding studies show that the intermediate filament protein vimentin selectively binds DNA sequences that are MARs, that are recognized by transcription factors, or that have structural properties important in recombination and gene expression (19Wang X. Tolstonog G. Shoeman R.L. Traub P. DNA Cell Biol. 1996; 15: 209-225Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). In the identification of NM proteins bound to nuclear DNA in situ, the cross-linker cis-diamminedichloroplatinum (cis-DDP) has become particularly useful (11Davie J.R. Samuel S. Spencer V. Bajno L. Sun J.-M. Chen H.Y. Holth L.T. Gene Ther. Mol. Biol. 1998; 1: 509-528Google Scholar, 22Ferraro A. Eufemi M. Cervoni L. Altieri F. Turano C. Acta Biochim.

Most proteins cross-linked to DNA with cis-DDP are nuclear matrix proteins, and the DNA cross-linked to protein is enriched in MAR sequences (21Olinski R. Wedrychowski A. Schmidt W.N. Briggs R.C.

Lamins, components of the nuclear pore-lamina, are cross-linked in situ to nuclear DNA consistent with in vitro data suggesting that these proteins are involved in the organization of nuclear DNA (26Wedrychowski A. Bhorjee J.S. Briggs R.C. Exp. Cell Res. 1989; 183: 376-387Crossref PubMed Scopus (6) Google Scholar, 27Wedrychowski A. Schmidt W.N. Hnilica L.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 3370-3376Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In this study, we incubated human breast cancer cell lines, T-47D5 and T5-PRF, with cis-DDP to find if cytokeratins were bound to nuclear DNA in situ. We demonstrate that cytokeratins 8, 18, and 19 are attached to nuclear DNA in T-47D5 and T5-PRF cells. Further, we show that the interaction between cytokeratins and nuclear DNA is regulated by estrogens in hormone-dependent T-47D5 but not in the hormone-independent T5-PRF cell line. These results support the idea that intermediate filaments are involved in the organization of nuclear DNA. The human breast carcinoma cell lines T-47D5 (28Watts C.K. Handel M.L. King R.J. Sutherland R.L. J. Steroid Biochem. Mol. Biol. 1992; 41: 529-536Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar) and T5-PRF (18Coutts A.S. Davie J.R. Dotzlaw H. Murphy L.C. J. Cell. Biochem. 1996; 63: 174-184Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar) were used. All cell lines were maintained at 37 °C (humidified atmosphere, 5% CO2/95% air) on 150 × 20-mm tissue culture dishes (Nunc) in culture medium containing Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (DMEM, Life Technologies, Inc.) supplemented with 1% (v/v) l-glutamine (stock solution concentration, 200 mm), 1% (v/v) glucose (stock solution concentration, 30% w/v), 1% (v/v) penicillin/streptomycin (stock solution concentrations, 10,000 units/ml and 10,000 μg/ml, respectively), and 5% (v/v) fetal calf serum (FCS, Life Technologies, Inc.) except for T5-PRF, which were maintained in medium containing Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium-phenol red free (Sigma), 5% (v/v) twice charcoal-stripped FCS and supplemented as mentioned above (5% CS) (18Coutts A.S. Davie J.R. Dotzlaw H. Murphy L.C. J. Cell. Biochem. 1996; 63: 174-184Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). T-47D5 cells acutely depleted of estrogen were grown in 5% CS for one passage, whereas T5-PRF cells were routinely passaged in 5% CS. Cells were passaged at 70–80% confluence using Earle's EDTA solution and set up in 100-mm dishes for experiments. For estrogen and antiestrogen treatments, the T-47D5 or T5-PRF cells were cultured for 72 h in the presence of 10 nm estradiol with or without 1 μm ICI 164,384 or the ethanol vehicle. Following treatments, cells were removed from the plates (confluence about 80%) with a rubber policeman and frozen as pellets containing 1 × 107 cells at −70 °C. Nuclear matrices were prepared according to methodologies previously reported (29Samuel S.K. Minish T.M. Davie J.R. Cancer Res. 1997; 57: 147-151PubMed Google Scholar). Cytoskeletal protein-enriched fractions were isolated according to the method of Sommers and colleagues (30Sommers C.L. Walker Jones D. Heckford S.E. Worland P. Valverius E. Clark R. McCormick F. Stampfer M. Abularach S. Gelmann E.P. Cancer Res. 1989; 49: 4258-4263PubMed Google Scholar). Cells were suspended in 4 °C Triton-high salt buffer (20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 0.6 m KCl, 1% Triton X-100, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride), incubated on ice for 20 min, and then centrifuged at 10,000 ×g for 20 min. The pellet was then resuspended in the same Triton-high salt buffer, incubated on ice for 20 min, and centrifuged once more. The pellet of insoluble proteins was resuspended in 8m urea. DNA-protein cross-linking was performed as described previously (31Ferraro A. Grandi P. Eufemi M. Altieri F. Cervoni L. Turano C. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1991; 178: 1365-1370Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). Human breast cancer cells were harvested from plates, and the cell pellet (1 × 106 cells/ml) was resuspended in Hanks' solution in which NaCl was substituted with sodium acetate at the same concentration and containing either 1 or 3 mm cis-DDP (31Ferraro A. Grandi P. Eufemi M. Altieri F. Cervoni L. Turano C. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1991; 178: 1365-1370Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). The cells were incubated at 37 °C for 2 h. Following this incubation, cells were treated with lysis buffer (5 m urea, 2 m guanidine HCl, 2 m NaCl, and 0.2m potassium phosphate, pH 7.5), and then hydroxylapatite (4 g per 20 A 260 units of lysate, Bio-Rad) was added. The hydroxylapatite resin was washed with lysis buffer to remove RNA and proteins not cross-linked to DNA. To reverse the cross-linking, the hydroxylapatite resin was incubated in lysis buffer that had 1m thiourea instead of 5 m urea. The proteins were released from hydroxylapatite, whereas the DNA remained bound. The released proteins were dialyzed overnight against double distilled water and then lyophilized. The lyophilized protein preparation was resuspended in 8 m urea. After protein isolation, a linear range of cytokeratin protein stainingversus protein amount was established by resolving increasing amounts of NM-IF protein on a SDS gel. The gel was then stained with 0.04% Serva Blue G (Serva) and subjected to scanning densitometry. The density of each cytokeratin band on the SDS gel was determined using the Quantity OneTM version 2.7 software (PDI, Kingston Station, NY). This software eliminated any background interference with cytokeratin band intensity. From this, it was concluded that 10 μg of DNA-cross-linked protein fell within the linear range for Serva Blue G staining. Thus, a sample load of 10 μg of DNA-cross-linked protein was applied to the SDS gel, and the density of each cytokeratin band was determined. Density values for the cytokeratin bands in each T-47D5 cell treatment and in the untreated T5-PRF cell line cultured in the absence of estrogen were related to the density values of cytokeratin bands in the untreated T-47D5 cell line grown continuously in DMEM supplemented with 5% FCS medium. This was accomplished by dividing the density value of each cytokeratin in the T5-PRF or T-47D5 treatment samples by the density value of the respective cytokeratin in the untreated T-47D5 cell line. Similarly, density values for cytokeratins of T5-PRF cells exposed to ICI or estrogen were related to levels expressed in the untreated T5-PRF cell line. Two-dimensional gel electrophoresis was performed as described previously (29Samuel S.K. Minish T.M. Davie J.R. Cancer Res. 1997; 57: 147-151PubMed Google Scholar). Gels were stained using the Amersham Pharmacia Biotech silver stain kit (Uppsala, Sweden) for protein detection. The gels were then dried between sheets of gel-drying film (Promega Corp., Madison, WI) at room temperature. The silver-stained two-dimensional gel patterns were scanned using a PDI 325OE densitometer (PDI, Kingston Station, NY), and the data were analyzed using the Image Master System (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech, Uppsala, Sweden). All studies were carried out using at least three preparations from each cell line. Our previous study showed that the levels of cytokeratins in the NM-IF fraction of T-47D5 cells were regulated by estradiol (18Coutts A.S. Davie J.R. Dotzlaw H. Murphy L.C. J. Cell. Biochem. 1996; 63: 174-184Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). To determine whether the interaction between cytokeratins and nuclear DNA was regulated by estradiol, the effect of estradiol withdrawal and re-addition on cytokeratin-DNA interaction was investigated. T-47D5 cells grown in the absence (one passage) or presence of estradiol were incubated with cis-DDP, and the proteins cross-linked to DNA were isolated. The cross-linked proteins were electrophoretically resolved on two-dimensional (Fig. 1) and one-dimensional SDS-polyacrylamide gels (Fig. 2 A). A comparison of Fig. 1 B with Fig. 1 A shows that when cells were grown in the absence of estradiol, there was a reduction in the relative amounts of cytokeratins 8, 18, and 19 bound to nuclear DNA. The addition of estradiol to cells grown in the absence of estradiol for one passage had a dramatic effect on the amount of cytokeratins binding to nuclear DNA in situ, with the levels of cytokeratins 8, 18, and 19 showing marked increases in abundance (Fig. 1 C). Inspection of the two-dimensional gel patterns showed that cytokeratins 8 and 19 did not co-migrate with other proteins with an identical molecular weight. This situation did not apply to cytokeratin 18, which co-migrated with other proteins. However, the two-dimensional gel showed that the levels of cytokeratin 18 followed a similar trend to levels displayed in the one-dimensional gel. The cytokeratins were not the only DNA-binding proteins whose levels were affected when cells were grown in the presence or absence of estrogen. However, not all cis-DDP cross-linked DNA-binding proteins were responsive to estrogen; for example, the levels of nuclear matrix proteins NMP-5, NMP-6, and hnRNP K were similar in the three preparations.Figure 2Effect of estrogen and antiestrogens on levels of cytokeratins cross-linked to DNA by cis-DDP in T-47D5 human breast cancer cells. Cells were cross-linked with 1 mm cis-DDP, and 10 μg of protein cross-linked to DNA was electrophoretically resolved on a SDS-polyacrylamide gel. The gel was stained with Serva Blue.

Values are expressed relative to levels observed in the T-47D5 cell line grown continuously in DMEM supplemented with 5% FCS.

The position of the molecular weight standards (in thousands) is shown on the left side of the gel.

The abundance of DNA-bound cytokeratins 8, 18, and 19 in cells grown in the absence of estrogen was reduced to levels of 0.60 ± 0.08, 0.64 ± 0.02, and 0.59 ± 0.11 (n = 3), respectively (Fig. 2 B), of the cells grown in the presence of estrogen. When estrogen was added back to the media of the cells cultured in the absence of estrogen, the levels of the DNA-attached cytokeratins 8, 18, and 19 rebounded to levels higher than those found in T-47D5 cells cultured in the presence of estrogens (1.95 ± 0.22, 1.59 ± 0.22, and 1.61 ± 0.17, n = 3, respectively) (Fig. 2 B). The proteins shown in Figs. 1 and 2 were from cells cross-linked with 3 and 1 mm cis-DDP, respectively. The relative levels of DNA-bound cytokeratin in cells grown with and without estrogens and treated with 3 mm cis-DDP yielded similar results to those treated with 1 mm cis-DDP. Treatment of T-47D5 cells with the antiestrogen ICI 164,384 reduced the amount of cytokeratins associated with the NM-IF fraction (18Coutts A.S. Davie J.R. Dotzlaw H. Murphy L.C. J. Cell. Biochem. 1996; 63: 174-184Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). The addition of ICI 164,384 had the same effect on the amount of cytokeratin interacting with nuclear DNA, with the amount of DNA-cross-linked cytokeratins 8, 18, and 19 being reduced to low levels (Fig. 2 C). The growth of the T5-PRF cell line (ER positive) is nonresponsive to estrogen, and its sensitivity to ICI 164,384 is less than that of T-47D5 cells (18Coutts A.S. Davie J.R. Dotzlaw H. Murphy L.C. J. Cell. Biochem. 1996; 63: 174-184Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). The NM-IF preparations from these cells had high amounts of cytokeratins 8, 18, and 19, regardless of whether the cells were grown in the presence or absence of estradiol (18Coutts A.S. Davie J.R. Dotzlaw H. Murphy L.C. J. Cell. Biochem. 1996; 63: 174-184Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). To determine whether the interaction between cytokeratins and DNA was nonresponsive to estrogen, proteins cross-linked to nuclear DNA in T5-PRF cells grown in the presence or absence of estrogen were isolated and analyzed by gel electrophoresis. The levels of DNA-bound cytokeratins 8, 18, and 19 in T5-PRF cells grown in the absence of estrogens were greater than those of DNA-bound cytokeratins of T-47D5 cells grown with estrogen (2.87 ± 0.9, 2.0 ± 0.41, 1.93 ± 0.16,n = 3, respectively) (Fig. 3, A and B). Incubation of T5-PRF cells with estrogen or ICI 164,384 in the presence of estrogen did not significantly alter the levels of cis-DDP DNA-cross-linked cytokeratins 8, 18, and 19 (Fig. 3). To determine whether estrogen affected the cellular levels of cytokeratins in hormone-responsive breast cancer cells, a high-salt Triton-insoluble cellular fraction, which contains 95% of the total cellular cytokeratins (32Chou C.F. Riopel C.L. Rott L.S. Omary M.B. J. Cell Sci. 1993; 105: 433-444Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), was isolated from T-47D5 and T5-PRF cells grown in the presence or absence of estrogen. Fig. 4 shows the two-dimensional gel patterns of the cytoskeletal protein-enriched fractions. This fraction from T-47D5 cells grown in the presence of estradiol had a much greater level of cytokeratins 8, 18, and (to a lesser extent) 19 than that from cells grown in the absence of estradiol. Treatment of T-47D5 cells with the antiestrogen ICI 164,384 in the presence of estrogen resulted in a major reduction in total cellular levels of cytokeratins (data not shown). In contrast, the levels of cytokeratins in the cytoskeletal protein-enriched fractions from T5-PRF cells grown with or without estradiol (and ICI 164,384; data not shown) were similar (Fig. 4). The levels of other major proteins in the T-47D5 or T5-PRF preparations were not affected in cells grown in the presence or absence of estradiol. Thus, the effect of estradiol in T-47D5 cells did not globally affect other cytoskeletal proteins. Nuclear matrix proteins have a key role in the organization of nuclear DNA into loop domains. Several MAR-binding proteins have been identified by in vitro methods, but few have been shown to bind to nuclear DNA in situ. Recently, Göhring and Fackelmayer (33Göhring F. Fackelmayer F.O. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 8276-8283Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar) presented evidence that SAF-A, a MAR-binding protein, was associated with DNA in situ. The cross-linking agent used was formaldehyde, which can cross-link protein to DNA. However, formaldehyde will also cross-link protein to protein; thus, indirect cross-linking between protein and DNA may occur (34Walter J. Biggin M.D. Methods. 1997; 11: 215-224Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar).cis-DDP cross-links DNA to protein (cross-link distance, 4 Å) (21Olinski R. Wedrychowski A. Schmidt W.N. Briggs R.C. Hnilica L.S. Cancer Res. 1987; 47: 201-205PubMed Google Scholar). This cross-linker preferentially cross-links nuclear matrix proteins to MAR DNA, making this reagent particularly useful in the identification of nuclear matrix proteins involved in the organization of nuclear DNA (11Davie J.R. Samuel S. Spencer V. Bajno L. Sun J.-M. Chen H.Y. Holth L.T. Gene Ther. Mol. Biol. 1998; 1: 509-528Google Scholar). Our results extend the original observations of Hnilica and colleagues (21Olinski R. Wedrychowski A. Schmidt W.N. Briggs R.C. Hnilica L.S. Cancer Res. 1987; 47: 201-205PubMed Google Scholar, 35Wedrychowski A. Schmidt W.N. Ward W.S. Hnilica L.S. Biochemistry. 1986; 25: 1-9Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar), who reported that cis-DDP cross-linked cytokeratins to nuclear DNA in Novikoff hepatoma cells. Cytokeratins 8, 18, and 19 are among the most prominent proteins cross-linked to DNA with cis-DDP in situ in ER-positive T-47D5 and T5-PRF human breast cancer cells. Comparable results were obtained when this analysis was done with a variety of ER-positive breast cancer cells lines, including MCF-7, T-47D, and ZR-75 (data not shown). Cytokeratins 8, 18, and 19 remained the most prominent proteins cross-linked to DNA of ER-positive breast cancer cells incubated with a range of cis-DDP concentrations (35 μm to 3 mm for 2 h, data not shown). Similarly, Hnilica and colleagues (21Olinski R. Wedrychowski A. Schmidt W.N. Briggs R.C. Hnilica L.S. Cancer Res. 1987; 47: 201-205PubMed Google Scholar) observed that cytokeratins were the major proteins cross-linked to DNA when Novikoff hepatoma-bearing rats were injected with low dosages of cis-DDP. The cytokeratins are also cross-linked to DNA with cis-DDP in ER-negative human breast cancer cells (MDA MB 231) (data not shown), although the abundance of cytokeratins 8 and 18 is less than that seen with the ER-positive cell lines. The lower levels of cytokeratins cross-linked to DNA in the MDA MB 231 cells reflect the lower expression of these cytoskeletal proteins in this cell line (36Trask D.K. Band V. Zajchowski D.A. Yaswen P. Suh T. Sager R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 2319-2323Crossref PubMed Scopus (169) Google Scholar, 37Kuang W.W. Thompson D.A. Hoch R.V. Weigel R.J. Nucleic Acids Res. 1998; 26: 1116-1123Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar). Although cytokeratins lack a nuclear localization signal, these proteins appear to be associated with the nuclear lamina (5Nickerson J.A. Krockmalnic G. He D.C. Penman S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 2259-2263Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar, 14Penman S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 5251-5257Crossref PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar). Intermediate filaments are thought to penetrate the double nuclear membrane and are part of the nuclear periphery lamina (19Wang X. Tolstonog G. Shoeman R.L. Traub P. DNA Cell Biol. 1996; 15: 209-225Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar, 20Ward W.S. Schmidt W.N. Schmidt C.A. Hnilica L.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1984; 81: 419-423Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). Further studies by Maniotis et al. (1Maniotis A.J. Chen C.S. Ingber D.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 849-854Crossref PubMed Scopus (1307) Google Scholar) showed that the intermediate filament network was sufficient to transmit mechanical stress to the nucleus. It is of interest to note that following the treatment of HeLa cells with cis-DDP (200 μm for 4 h), most platinum was seen in nucleoli and as patches located on the inner side of the double nuclear membrane and in the nucleoplasm (38Khan M.U. Sadler P.J. Chem. Biol. Interact. 1978; 21: 227-232Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). It is possible that cis-DDP is cross-linking cytokeratins that are interacting with nuclear DNA located at the inner side of the nuclear membrane. The ability of cis-DDP to cross-link cytokeratins to DNA suggests that these intermediate filament proteins are MAR-binding proteins involved in the organization of nuclear DNA. Estrogen regulates the cytoskeletal levels of cytokeratins and the interaction between cytokeratins and nuclear DNA in ER-positive, hormone-dependent breast cancer cells. The removal of estrogen or the introduction of an estrogen antagonist (ICI 164,384) results in decreased levels of intermediate filaments composed of cytokeratins and a corresponding decline in cytokeratins associated with the nuclear matrix and binding to nuclear DNA (18Coutts A.S. Davie J.R. Dotzlaw H. Murphy L.C. J. Cell. Biochem. 1996; 63: 174-184Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar) (this study). Rearrangement of the keratin intermediate filaments (called tonofilaments) in MCF-7 (ER-positive, hormone-dependent) human breast cancer cells was observed when cells were deprived of estrogens or treated with antiestrogens (39Sapino A. Pietribiasi F. Bussolati G. Marchisio P.C. Cancer Res. 1986; 46: 2526-2531PubMed Google Scholar). Further, in agreement with our observations, the latter study observed that administration of estrogen increased the keratin filamentous network in the breast cancer cells. It is also expected that a reorganization of chromatin will accompany this rearrangement of the tonofilaments. In contrast, an ER-positive human breast cancer cell line, T5-PRF, that has acquired the ability to grow normally in a medium greatly depleted of estrogens had higher amounts of cytokeratins associated with the cytoskeleton, nuclear matrix, and DNA than did the parent cell line cultured with estrogen. Regardless of the presence or absence of estradiol or the administration of an antiestrogen, the cytokeratin interaction with nuclear DNA was not affected. Thus, the T5-PRF cell line has lost the capacity of estrogen to regulate cytokeratin interaction with nuclear DNA. The organization of nuclear DNA mediated by cytokeratins will be maintained in these cells regardless of whether estrogen is present or absent. These observations are particularly important in breast cancer, as progression of breast epithelial cells to malignancy is accompanied by increased expression of cytokeratins 8 and 18 (36Trask D.K. Band V. Zajchowski D.A. Yaswen P. Suh T. Sager R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 2319-2323Crossref PubMed Scopus (169) Google Scholar). Nuclear matrix proteins are informative biomarkers in analysis of many types of cancer (40Replogle-Schwab T.S. Pienta K.J. Getzenberg R.H. Crit. Rev. Eukaryotic Gene Expression. 1996; 6: 103-113Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). During the preparation of nuclear matrix proteins, intermediate filaments are often removed (29Samuel S.K. Minish T.M. Davie J.R. Cancer Res. 1997; 57: 147-151PubMed Google Scholar). Our study and those of Hnilica and colleagues (21Olinski R. Wedrychowski A. Schmidt W.N. Briggs R.C. Hnilica L.S. Cancer Res. 1987; 47: 201-205PubMed Google Scholar, 27Wedrychowski A. Schmidt W.N. Hnilica L.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 3370-3376Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) show that cytokeratins are nuclear matrix proteins associated with nuclear DNA. These observations argue that informative nuclear matrix proteins may be lost during previously used protocols for the preparation of nuclear matrix proteins. Thus, the characterization of nuclear matrix proteins and proteins cross-linked to DNA by cis-DDP in situ, which are primarily nuclear matrix proteins, are two complementary approaches that can be used to identify nuclear matrix proteins that are informative in cancer diagnosis."

The L-A dsRNA1 virus has a single segment of 4.6 kilobases which replicates inside yeast cells, where it is maintained at a copy number of 1,000 or more without a substantial adverse effect on cell growth (1Wickner R.B. Microbiol. Rev. 1996; 60: 250-265Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 2Wickner R.B. Fields B.N. Knipe D.M. Howley P.M. Fields Virology. 3rd. Ed. 1. Raven Press, New York1996: 557-585Google Scholar). The icosahedral L-A virus particles are composed of 120 copies of the major coat protein (Gag) and about 2 copies of a Gag-Pol fusion protein (3Cheng R.H. Caston J.R. Wang G.-j. Gu F. Smith T.J.

Chem. 1998; 273: 9306-9311Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). The L-A (+) strand serves as the mRNA, encoding Gag and Gag-Pol, the latter formed by a −1 ribosomal frameshift event (5Icho T. Wickner R.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 6716-6723Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 6Dinman J.D. Icho T. Wickner R.B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 174-178Crossref PubMed Scopus (259) Google Scholar). These proteins also support the propagation of a satellite RNA, called M1dsRNA, which encodes the secreted polypeptide “killer toxin” and immunity to this toxin (7Bostian K.A. Sturgeon J.A. Tipper D.J. J. Bacteriol. 1980; 143: 463-470Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Propagation of M1 is particularly sensitive to the efficiency of expression of the L-A mRNA, suggesting that only excess Gag and Gag-Pol, above the needs of L-A itself, are available to support M1. Because L-A mRNA lacks both a 5′-cap and 3′-poly(A) and induces a −1 ribosomal frameshift in expressing Gag-Pol, mutations affecting L-A virus propagation have included mutations in many components of the translation apparatus. Mutations in SKI2, SKI3, SKI6, SKI7, and SKI8 result in elevated virus copy number (8Toh-e A. Guerry P. Wickner R.B. J. Bacteriol. 1978; 136: 1002-1007Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 9Ridley S.P.

Genetics. 1995; 141: 95-105Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) as well as by several other genes and drugs influencing translation (17Dinman J.D. Wickner R.B.

Most of these agents and mutations accordingly influence viral propagation. Mutations in genes resulting in an inability to propagate M1 dsRNA are called mak mutations. 20mak genes have been found to affect or be deficient in 60 S ribosomal subunits (21Wickner R.B. Ridley S.P. Fried H.M. Ball S.G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1982; 79: 4706-4708Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar, 22Ohtake Y. Wickner R.B. Mol. Cell.

Bacteriol. 1995; 177: 2887-2891Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), but no mak mutants deficient in 40 S subunits were identified (22Ohtake Y. Wickner R.B. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 2772-2781Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). Based on the proposal that the 3′-poly(A) structure may facilitate the 60 S subunit joining reaction (24Munroe D. Jacobson A. Gene (Amst.). 1990; 91: 151-158Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar), we suggested that 60 S-deficient mutants may be preferentially defective in translation of non-poly(A) mRNAs, such as viral mRNA (10Masison D.C. Blanc A. Ribas J.C. Carroll K. Sonenberg N. Wickner R.B. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 2763-2771Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar, 22Ohtake Y. Wickner R.B. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 2772-2781Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). However, there has been no direct evidence for this suggestion. Here we clone the MAK21 gene and analyze the effects of mak21 mutations on translation and ribosome subunits. Saccharomyces cerevisiae strain D2-3C (a mak21-1 ura3 his5 ade2) was provided by Daniel Masison. Strains 3164 (a arg1 kar1-1 L-A-HN M1) and 3165 (α arg1 thr(1,x) kar1-1 L-A-HN M1) were used for cytoduction of L-A and M1. Yeast genomic λ clones (25Riles L. Dutchik J.E. Baktha A. McCauley B.K. Thayer E.C. Leckie M.P. Braden V.V. Depke J.E. Olson M.V. Genetics. 1993; 134: 81-150Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), ATCC71164, 70347, 70812, 70443, 71181, and 71075 were obtained from the American Type Culture Collection. Pfupolymerase (Stratagene) was used for PCR and a Bio-Rad kit for site-directed mutagenesis. λ clones covering the region on chromosome IV wheremak21-1 is located (26Wickner R.B. Leibowitz M.J. J. Bacteriol. 1979; 140: 154-160Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) were tested for complementation of mak21-1 using in vivo recombination with vector pBM2240 (27Erickson J.R. Johnston M. Genetics. 1993; 134: 151-157Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Strain D2-3C was transformed by the spheroplast method with a mixture of 1 μg of λ clone DNA and 0.1 μg of linear plasmid pBM2240 digested with EcoRI and XhoI. These transformants were used as cytoduction recipients from strain 3165, and the cytoductants were tested by the killer assay (9Ridley S.P. Sommer S.S. Wickner R.B. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1984; 4: 761-770Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). Only clone 71164 complemented mak21-1. Media have been defined previously (9Ridley S.P. Sommer S.S. Wickner R.B. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1984; 4: 761-770Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). Subclones of λ ATCC71164 in the centromere plasmid pRS316 were tested for complementation of mak21-1 in strain D2-3C cytoduction as above. Only the 6.8-kilobase XbaI fragment shown in Fig. 1 complemented mak21-1. Subclones of this fragment inserted in pRS316 (Fig. 1) included the 4.7-kilobaseXbaI-SalI fragment (p782) which complementedmak21-1. The XbaI-NheI fragment from p782 encompassingMAK21 was ligated into the XbaI site of pRS315 forming pH102 (=pRS315-MAK21). MAK21 bordered byXhoI and SacI sites was then transferred to theXhoI-SacI window of pRS313 and pRS316 (28Sikorski R.S. Hieter P. Genetics. 1989; 122: 19-27Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), resulting in pH110 and pH107, respectively. The XbaI-SalI fragment from p782 includingMAK21 was ligated intoXbaI-SalI-digested pBS KS+. After ligation of aBglII linker (NEB1001) into the StuI site at base 3447 of MAK21, the HIS3 gene of pJJ215 (29Jones J.S. Prakash L. Yeast. 1990; 6: 363-366Crossref PubMed Scopus (327) Google Scholar), bordered by BamHI sites, was cloned into theBglII-digested MAK21 plasmid, resulting in pH75 (Fig. 1 shows the region deleted). To confirm the disruption, genomic DNA of putative disruptant strain YHE353 was digested withSnaBI and PstI and probed with theSalI-PstI fragment from p782. This confirmed the integrity of the 3′-integration border. Probing YHE353 genomic DNA digested with SnaBI and NsiI with theBamHI-NsiI fragment from pJJ215 confirmed the integrity of the 5′-integration site. pRS316-SKI2 (30Widner W.R. Wickner R.B. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 4331-4341Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar) and pRS316-SKI6 (11Benard L. Carroll K. Valle R.C.P. Wickner R.B. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 2688-2696Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar) have been described. The expression plasmids pH116 and pH118 were made by ligating the ADH1 cassette from pVT103 (31Vernet T. Dignard D. Thomas D.Y. Gene (Amst.). 1987; 52: 225-233Crossref PubMed Scopus (465) Google Scholar), obtained after PCR amplification using primers HE66 (5′-ACAGCTAGCATTACGCCAGCAACTTCT-3′) and HE67 (5′-ACAAGATCTTAATGCAGCCGGTAGAG-3′), intoPvuII-digested pRS313 (28Sikorski R.S. Hieter P. Genetics. 1989; 122: 19-27Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), replacing the latter's multiple cloning region. In pH118 the ADH1 cassette is oriented opposite that in pH116, being directed toward the HIS3 gene. The luc+ ORF, bordered by BamHI and XhoI sites, was transferred from pH96 (see below) into theBamHI-XhoI windows of pH116 and pH118, creating pH170 and pH171. Thus pH170 and pH171 have theADH1-luciferase cassette in two orientations relative toHIS3. A 516-base pair SSA3 promoter fragment was obtained by PCR amplification from the genomic DNA of strain Σ1278b using primers HE49 (5′-CTTGGATCCTTTGTAGCGTTTAGTACC-3′) and HE50 (5′-CAAGCTAGCATTGCCTGAACAATACTC-3′). This SSA3 fragment was used to replace the ADH1 promoter in pH170 and pH171, resulting in pH172 and 173, respectively. To place the L-A genome under control of the Sp6 promoter, the L-A gag region was amplified by PCR from pTIL05 (5Icho T. Wickner R.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 6716-6723Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) using oligonucleotides JR71 (5′-CGACGGCCAGTGAATTCATTTAGGTGACACTATAGAAAAATTTTTAAATTC-3′) and HE4 (5′-CTTGGATCCCGGGTCCGTGTGAGGGTTC-3′). The product was cloned into the HincII site of pBS KS+ (pH91). TheEcoRV-BamHI fragment from pH91 was replaced with the EcoRV-BamHI fragment from pTIL05, producing pH94. An SmaI site was introduced at the L-A ATG codon of pH94 by site-directed mutagenesis using oligonucleotide HE54 (5′-ACAAATCTTAGCCCGGGGAGTTATAT-3′), resulting in pH148. TheSphI site of pH94 was changed into an SmaI site by linker insertion using oligonucleotide HE52 (5′-ACCCGGGTCATG-3′), resulting in pH160. To place luc+ between StuI sites, theluc+ ORF was amplified by PCR from plasmid pSP-luc(+) (Promega) using oligonucleotides HE39 (5′-CAAAGGCCTCATGGAAGACGCCAAAAAC-3′) and HE40 (5′-CACAGGCCTAAGCTTCACTTACACGGCGATCTTTCC-3′). The product was cloned into the EcoRV site of pBS KS+, resulting in clone pH96. Insertion of the StuI fragment from pH96 containingluc+ into the SmaI site of pH148 and pH160 resulted in pH149 and pH161, respectively. A human CCAAT box-binding factor (hCBF) clone (pMT2-CBF) was kindly provided by Daniel Linzer (Department of Biochemistry, Molecular Biology, and Cell Biology, Northwestern University). The hCBF ORF is tightly bordered by NcoI sites. The NcoI fragment of pMT2-CBF was cloned into pH291, producing pH293, in which hCBF expression is under the control of the ADH1 promoter present on this LEU2 2-μ plasmid. An XhoI site was introduced by site-directed mutagenesis (Bio-Rad) immediately downsteam of the MAK21stop codon in pH115 (see below) using oligonucleotide HE81 (5′-GTGTTTAGTTAATGTATTATCTCGAGCTAGTCTGAATCTTG-3′), resulting in clone pH183. The HindIII-XhoI-bordered MAK21ORF was transferred into the HindIII-XhoI window of pBC KS+ (Stratagene) to give pH232. The ADH1 expression cassette from pVT101 was amplified by PCR using oligonucleotides HE66 and HE67 and ligated into PvuII-digested pRS315, resulting in pH268. The GAL1,10 promoter bordered by EcoRI and BamHI sites was transferred from pBM272 (32Johnston M. Davis R.W. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1984; 4: 1440-1448Crossref PubMed Scopus (634) Google Scholar) into theEcoRI-BamHI window of pBC KS+ (Stratagene). After the EcoRI site was changed into an NheI site using of oligonucleotide HE93, and the BamHI site was changed into a HindIII site, the resultingNheI-HindIII fragment encompassing theGAL1 promoter was used to replace theNheI-HindIII-bordered ADH1 promoter in pH268. The resulting construct was designated pH272, and theMAK21 ORF encompassed within theHindIII-XhoI fragment of pH232 was ligated into its HindIII-XhoI window, resulting in pH287. The SmaI-ApaI sites of pH102 (=pRS315-MAK21) were fused, resulting in pH113. Using oligonucleotide HE55 (5′-TTCTCACTCATTAAGCTTGATTACTGTAC-3′) an HindIII site was created in pH113 immediately upstream of the ATG start codon of MAK21, resulting in pH115. Ser-207, Val-228, or Arg-248 was changed into an ATG start codon with a HindIII site directly upstream of Ser-207, Val-228, or Arg-248 in pH115 by site-directed mutagenesis using oligonucleotide HE107 (5′-GGAATAATAAGTTTGTCAGACATAAGCTTAGTAGTTTGAGTAAT-3′) or HE106 (5′-CATCATCATTTTGTCCCATAAGCTTATCCAATGGAATTTC-3′) or HE85 (5′-TAGCGTTTGCTTACCCATAAGCTTAAGTTTCTCAATCTG-3′). During these mutageneses an XhoI site was created directly downstream of the MAK21 stop codon using oligonucleotide HE81 (5′-GTGTTTAGTTAATGTATTATCTCGAGCTAGTCTGAATCTTG-3′). Subsequently theHindIII sites were fused, producing pH310, pH311, and pH216, respectively. Asn-961, Ala-933, Val-898, or Ala-873 was changed to a stop codon with an XhoI site directly downstream of Asn-961, Ala-933, Val-898, or Ala-873 in clone pH115 by site-directed mutagenesis using oligonucleotide HE75 (5′-CGAAGGAACGTTTTTTCTCGAGTTAGTCTTGTTCTCCATCGAA-3′), HE88 (5′-TTCTTGGCTGCCTTCCTCGAGTTAATCTTCATCATCAAT-3′), HE89 (5′-ACTGTCGTCGTCATCCTCGAGTTAATCTGGTCTCGATTT-3′), or HE113 (5′-TTCGTCATCACTATCGAACTCGAGTTATTTGTTAGATTTCTTTCCT-3′). During these mutageneses a second XhoI site was created downstream of the MAK21 stop codon using oligonucleotide HE81. Subsequently the XhoI sites were fused, resulting in pH211, pH280, pH281, and pH309. To verify that M1 dsRNA is lost from strains from which polysome profiles would be prepared a mak21-1 strain (YHE414 = MATα ura3 his3 mak21-1) was crossed with a wild-type strain (YHE413 = MATa leu2 his3 K+), and the ability to maintain M1 satellite RNA was shown to segregate 2:2 in all eight meiotic tetrads was examined. On crossing YHE561 (MATa leu2 trp1 his3 ski6-2 K+) with YHE414, the slow growth phenotype of mak21-1 (26Wickner R.B. Leibowitz M.J. J. Bacteriol. 1979; 140: 154-160Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) segregated 2:2 as did the inability to grow at 39 °C resulting from theski6-2 allele (11Benard L. Carroll K. Valle R.C.P. Wickner R.B. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 2688-2696Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). Among 28 tetrads dissected, three showed 4 K+:0 segregation, 21 showed 3 K+:K−, three showed 2 K+:2 K−, and one showed 1 K− : 3 K+. One segregant, strain YHE618 (69–15D =MATa ura3 leu2 his3 mak21-1 ski6-2 K+ ts39 °C), was transformed with pRS316-SKI6 (11Benard L. Carroll K. Valle R.C.P. Wickner R.B. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 2688-2696Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar) and became K− (YHE659). This K− strain was then allowed to lose pRS316-SKI6 and transformed with plasmids carrying SKI6 and/or MAK21. Similarly, in the cross of YHE626 (MATa leu2 trp1 ski2::HIS3 K+) with YHE414 segregants withmak21-1 were identified by their slow growth phenotype and ski2 by His prototrophy. Of 24 tetrads, four showed 4 K+:0 segregation, 11 showed 3 K+:1 K−, and 9 showed 2 K+:2 K−. One segregant, YHE633 (71–4D = MATa ura3 leu2 trp1 mak21-1 ski2::HIS3 K+), was transformed with pRS316-SKI2 and became K− as a result (YHE658). This strain was allowed to lose pRS316-SKI2 and transformed with plasmids carrying SKI2and/or MAK21. Strains YHE561, YHE414, YHE618, YHE626, YHE633, and YHE686 were grown in -Leu, -Ura medium until the cell density reached anA 600 between 0.400 and 0.550. Cells were broken with glass beads in phosphate-buffered saline containing 100 μg/ml phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride. The protein concentration was measured with the Bradford assay (Bio-Rad), and 7.5 μg of total protein was analyzed for Gag by Western blotting. From the extract dsRNA was isolated by phenol extraction. Protein extracts were analyzed by electrophoresis on an 8% SDS-polyacrylamide gel and blotted onto a nitrocellulose membrane. L-A Gag protein was visualized using an anti-Gag monoclonal antibody (yCP6) and anti-mouse IgG-conjugated alkaline phosphatase (Promega) (33Ribas J.C. Fujimura T. Wickner R.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 28420-28428Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). A 5′-MAK21 sequence tag was fused to the 3′-end of the green fluorescent protein (GFP) ORF by amplifying the GFP ORF from plasmid pYGFP (34Cormack B.P. Bertram G. Egerton M. Gow N.A. Falkow S. Brown A.J. Microbiology. 1997; 143: 303-311Crossref PubMed Scopus (502) Google Scholar) using primers HE57 (5′-GCCGTTGTTCTCACTCATTTTGTACAATTCATCCATACC-3′) and HE58 (5′-AACAAGCTTAATGTCTAAAGGTGAAGAAT-3′). This product was used as a megaprimer to amplify the first 565 nucleotides from MAK21from plasmid p782 aided by oligonucleotides HE58 and HE59 (5′-TCTCTGCAGATTCTGATT-3′). The product was cloned into theEcoRV site of pBC KS+ (Stratagene) creating pH165. TheHindIII/PstI fragment from pH165 was used to replace the HindIII/PstI window of pH115, creating pH209. Strain YHE393 carrying pH209 is strain YHE505. M827 was changed to a stop codon as described for pH211 but using oligonucleotides HE83 (5′-GTTCACGGGACCCTGCTCGAGTTAAATATCAGATGCCTTAA-3′) and HE81, resulting in pH212. The HindIII-PstI fragment from pH165 was used to replace theHindIII-PstI window of pH212, creating pH283. YHE393 carrying pH283 is strain YHE533. The GFP ORF from pYGFP was amplified by PCR using oligonucleotides HE58 and HE69 (5′-AGTCTCGAGTTATTTGTACAATTCATCCATAC-3′). The product was cloned into the EcoRV site of pBC KS+, resulting in pH163. Replacement of the HindIII-XhoI bordered MAK21 ORF from pH183 with the HindIII-XhoI-bordered GFP ORF from pH163 resulted in pH210. YHE393 carrying pH210 is strain YHE506. GFP was visualized using an Axiovet 100TV microscope (Zeiss, Germany), and images were recorded using a C5810 color chilled 3CCD camera (Hamamatsu Photonics Systems, Japan) and processed using Adobe Photoshop. The mak21-1 mutation is on chromosome IV between trp1 and aro1 (26Wickner R.B. Leibowitz M.J. J. Bacteriol. 1979; 140: 154-160Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). λ clones of this region (25Riles L. Dutchik J.E. Baktha A. McCauley B.K. Thayer E.C. Leckie M.P. Braden V.V. Depke J.E. Olson M.V. Genetics. 1993; 134: 81-150Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) were screened for complementation of mak21-1, and only ATCC71164 showed positive complementation (see “Materials and Methods”). Subclones of λ71164 were likewise tested for complementation of mak21-1, and only the 6.8-kilobase XbaI fragment shown at the top of Fig. 1 complemented mak21-1.Subcloning this XbaI fragment showed that theKpnI, EagI, and SpeI sites were within the complementing gene (Fig. 1). Sequencing the ends of theXbaI-SalI fragment showed that theXbaI site on the left in Fig. 1 is at base 570,079 of chromosome IV, and the XbaI site at theright is at base 576,879. The KpnI,EagI, and SpeI sites are all insideYDR060W. Because this fragment is located at the genetic map position of mak21-1, YDR060W is theMAK21 gene and not a suppressor. Because the rrp1 mutation maps close to mak21-1and, like mak21-1, rrp1 results in loss of M1dsRNA, it was thought possible that RRP1 was identical toMAK21 (35Fabian G.R. Hopper A.K. J. Bacteriol. 1987; 169: 1571-1578Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). However, the restriction map of the clones carrying RRP1 are different from that of MAK21,and recently RRP1 has been sequenced, showing that it is identical toYDR087C 3D. R. Stanford, S. M. Hess, R. J. Crouch, and A. K. Hopper, personal communication. and thus distinct from MAK21. One of the MAK21 genes of the diploid strain YHE305 (MATa/MATα ura3/ura3 his3/his3 trp1/+ leu2/+) was replaced with the HIS3 gene using plasmid pH75 (see “Materials and Methods” and Fig. 1), resulting in strain YHE353, and the disruption was confirmed by Southern blotting. Of 32 meiotic tetrads from strain YHE353, 31 tetrads had only two viable spores, and the remaining tetrad contained only one viable spore. Of these 32 tetrads 11 were germinated at 30 °C, 10 at 25 °C, and 11 at 20 °C. Thus the germination temperature did not seem to influence spore viability. MAK21 is thus needed for spore germination or for growth. To investigate if MAK21 is needed for spore germination or for cell growth, tetrads from strain YHE353 carrying pH107 (URA3 CEN MAK21, see “Materials and Methods”) were were germinated on medium lacking uracil. Cells from eight tetrads containing four germinating ascospores were transferred to media containing 5-fluoroorotic acid to eliminate the URA3 plasmid. All eight tetrads showed 2:2 segregation for growth. Thus MAK21 is not only needed for spore germination, it is absolutely required for viability. The 1,025-residue Mak21p shares substantial sequence similarity throughout its length with the hCBF (36Lum L.S. Hsu S. Vaewhongs M. Wu B. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1992; 12: 2599-2605Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). Other ORFs of unknown function from mouse, Caenorhabditis elegans, and Schizosaccharomyces pombe also show significant amino acid similarity with Mak21p (see Fig. 2). The hCBF stimulates expression from the hsp70 CCAAT box promoter in tissue culture cells. It was identified by its specific binding to this promoter. As shown diagramatically in Fig. 2, 77 residues are conserved in all five homologs, and 90 are conserved in four of five homologs, and these are distributed through most of the length of the five proteins. The control of human hsp70 expression by hCBP suggested that the homologous Mak21p might control the expression of yeast hsp70. The most homologous yeast hsp70 to the human hsp70 controlled by hCBP is Ssa3p (37Werner-Washburne M. Stone D.E. Craig E.A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1987; 7: 2568-2577Crossref PubMed Scopus (293) Google Scholar, 38Werner-Washburne M. Craig E.A. Genome. 1989; 31: 684-689Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). Of its 649 residues, 445 are identical to the human hsp70. The promoter of the SSA3 gene contains an inverted CCAAT box. To estimate expression from the SSA3 promoter, we constructed two plasmids (pH172 and pH173) in which transcription of luciferase was driven by the SSA3 promoter, differing only in the orientation of the SSA3-luciferase cassette relative to the HIS3 gene. Two similar plasmids, in which theADH1 promoter drives luciferase transcription, were used as controls (see “Materials and Methods”). The four plasmids were transformed into strain YHE414 (MATα ura3 his3 mak21-1) containing either pRS316 (a URA3 CEN plasmid) or pH107 (pRS316-MAK21). Transformants were grown in 50 ml of SD medium to A 600 = 0.6. After resuspension of the cells in phosphate-buffered saline, protein extracts were prepared by disruption with glass beads. Luciferase activity was measured using the Promega luciferase assay kit and a luminometer (10Masison D.C. Blanc A. Ribas J.C. Carroll K. Sonenberg N. Wickner R.B. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 2763-2771Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar, 11Benard L. Carroll K. Valle R.C.P. Wickner R.B. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 2688-2696Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar) and was corrected for the protein concentration of the extract, measured using the Bradford assay. For luciferase expression from the ADH1 promoter, the ratio of activity in a mak21-1 mutant to that in the wild type was 1.57 ± 0.46 (10 independent assays), probably not a significant increase. For luciferase from the SSA3 promoter, the same ratio was 4.7 ± 3.4. The increase in SSA3-promoted activity in mak21 cells is the opposite of what would be expected if Mak21p were functioning the same in yeast as does hCBF in human cells. From transformants of a clone of hCBF under the ADH1 promoter (pH293-LEU2 2 μ) in YHE393 (MATα leu2 trp1 ura3 mak21::HIS3 pH107 {URA3 CEN MAK21} K+) were selected 5-fluoroorotic acid-resistant colonies. However, the appearance of resistant cells was below 1 in 10,000, suggesting that loss of the MAK21 plasmid was lethal. One resistant isolate was analyzed for the presence of plasmids by Southern blotting. This showed that recombination had taken place, resulting in loss of the original plasmids. Thus, hCBF cannot substitute for Mak21p in yeast. The same eight strains used to examine SSA3 expression above were used to compare L-A levels in mak21-1 and MAK21 strains. L-A Gag levels are at least 2-fold less in the mak21-1strains compared with the MAK21-complemented strains (Fig. 3). Examination of phenol-extracted nucleic acids or RNase-resistant dsRNA showed likewise that there was twice as much L-A dsRNA present in the extract of MAK21cells as in that of mak21-1 cells (Fig. 3). Polysome profiles (10Masison D.C. Blanc A. Ribas J.C. Carroll K. Sonenberg N. Wickner R.B. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 2763-2771Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar, 11Benard L. Carroll K. Valle R.C.P. Wickner R.B. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 2688-2696Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar) were examined from wild-type strain YHE413, the mak21-1 strain YHE414, YHE432 (YHE414 containing plasmid pRS313 {HIS3 CEN}) and YHE433 (YHE414 containing plasmid pH110 {HIS3 CEN MAK21}). Strains YHE413 and YHE414 were grown in YPAD, and strains YHE432 and YHE433 were grown in -His medium. The polysome profiles of themak21-1 strains YHE414 and YHE432 show a marked increase in the ratio of free 40 S to 60 S ribosomal subunits compared with the wild-type strain YHE413 and also contain pronounced halfmer polysomes peaks (Fig. 4 A). The 40 S:60 S ratio was restored to wild-type levels by theMAK21 expression plasmid (strain YHE433), with a concurrent disappearance of halfmer polysomes. Because the ratio of free 60 S subunits to free 40 S subunits was decreased in mak21-1 strains, we examined the ratio of total 40 S to 60 S subunits. The mak21-1 strain YHE432 containing the vector pRS313 was compared with the same strain carrying the MAK21 plasmid pH110 grown in -His medium to anA 600 between 0.4 and 0.5. Cells were broken in buffer lacking cyclohexamide and MgCl2, and the cell extract was loaded onto a sucrose gradient lacking MgCl2. The sucrose gradients were centrifuged for 14 h at 27,000 rpm. In the mak21-1 strain the 40 S:60 S ratio (asA 260) was 0.83, whereas this ratio was 0.64 in the isogenic MAK21 strain (Fig. 4 B). Thus themak21-1 strain has an imbalance in the 40 S:60 S ratio probably because of a decrease in 60 S ribosomal subunits since the 40 S peaks are nearly identical in the two strains whereas the 60 S peaks differ. Because MAK21is essential for cell viability we analyzed the effect of depleting Mak21p on ribosomal subunit biogenesis by putting Mak21p expression under the control of the GAL1 promoter. After transforming pH287 (GAL1::MAK21) into strain YHE393 (MATα leu2 trp1 ura3 mak21::HIS3 K+ pH107), theADH1::MAK21 expression plasmid pH107 was eliminated by 5′-fluoro-orotic acid selection, making Mak21p expression dependent on the activity of the GAL1 promoter of pH287 (strain YHE565). Strain YHE565 was grown in galactose/raffinose medium toA 600 = 0.640. Cells were collected and resuspended in YPAD, to shut off production of Mak21p, or in YPAgal/raf. The doubling time in galactos"

The exodomain alone binds hormone with high affinity, whereas the endodomain is the site of receptor activation. Coordination of these two domains is essential for successful hormone action but little is known about their functional and structural relationship. In this communication, we report that exoloop 3 of FSH-R constrains follicle-stimulating hormone binding to the exodomain. When the FSH-R exodomain was prepared by truncating its endodomain, the hormone binding affinity of the exodomain was slightly improved, compared with the wild type receptor. The binding affinity was further improved by >3-fold when the exodomain was attached to the membrane-associated domain of CD8. These results suggest that the FSH-R endodomain attenuates hormone binding at the exodomain. As a first step to test this hypothesis, the 11 amino acids except Ala589 of exoloop 3 were individually substituted with Ala. Ala substitution for Leu583 or Ile584 improved the hormone binding affinity by 4–6-fold while totally abolishing cAMP induction, indicating an inverse relationship. The Ala substitution for Lys580 or Pro582 had a similar trend but to a lesser extent. This significant improvement in the binding affinity suggests that the four residues at the N-terminal region of exoloop 3 interact with the exodomain and constrain the hormone binding in the wild type receptor. This effect is specific since substitutions for other than the 4 residues did not improve the hormone binding affinity. Computer modeling shows that the 4 residues can be positioned on one side of exoloop 3. This result and the apparent inverse relationship of hormone binding and cAMP induction suggest that these two essential functions may work against each other. Therefore, hormone binding might be compromised to preserve cAMP inducibility while maintaining a reasonably high, but below maximum, binding affinity.

The FSH1 receptor and other glycoprotein hormone (LH/CG and TSH) receptors belong to a structurally unique subfamily of G protein-coupled receptors (1Ji T.H. Grossmann M. Ji I. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 17299-17302Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (555) Google Scholar). Unlike other receptor subfamilies, they comprise two equal halves, an extracellular N-terminal half (exodomain) and a membrane-associated C-terminal half (endodomain) (2McFarland K. Sprengel R.

Endocrine. 1995; 3: 187-194Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar), which is structurally equivalent to the entire molecule of many other G protein-coupled receptors (15Probst W. Snyder L. Schuster D. Brosius J. Sealfon S. DNA Cell Biol. 1992; 11: 1-20Crossref PubMed Scopus (685) Google Scholar). Existing evidence suggests that glycoprotein hormones initially bind to the exodomain, and then the resulting hormone-exodomain complex interacts with the endodomain (1Ji T.H. Grossmann M. Ji I. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 17299-17302Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (555) Google Scholar). This secondary interaction is responsible for signal generation (1Ji T.H. Grossmann M. Ji I. J.

Endocrine. 1995; 3: 187-194Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). Despite the importance of this secondary contact and the relationship between the two domains, there is little information on the subject, particularly concerning the FSH receptor. Because the exodomain of the LH/CG receptor lacking the endomain is capable of high affinity hormone binding (6Tsai-Morris C.H. Buczko E. Wang W. Dufau M.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 19385-19388Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 7Xie Y.B. Wang H. Segaloff D.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 21411-21414Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 8Ji I.

Endocrinol. 1995; 9: 159-170Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) the high affinity hormone binding appears to be independent of the endodomain. Contrary to this view, we recently observed that human CG binding to the LH/CG receptor is regulated by certain residues of exoloop 2 (16Ryu K. Lee H. Kim S. Beauchamp J. Tung C. Isaacs N.W. Ji I. Ji T.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 6285-6291Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). In this study, we set out to determine the effect of the endodomain on hormone binding at the exodomain of the FSH receptor. As a first step, exoloop 3 of the endodomain was examined because it is the shortest exoloop and linked to transmembrane domain 6 that is important for signal transfer (17Kudo M. Osuga Y. Kobilka B. Hsueh A. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 22470-22478Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar). Each mutant human FSH receptor cDNA was prepared in a pSELECT vector using the non-PCR-based altered sites mutagenesis system (Promega), sequenced, subcloned into pcDNA3 (Invitrogen) as described (18Ji I. Ji T.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 15970-15973Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). After subcloning pcDNA3, the mutant cDNAs were sequenced again. In one of the mutants, the codon following Asp341 was substituted with a stop codon to produce the truncated exodomain, Cys1-Asp341. The exodomain/CD8 plasmid (19Osuga Y. Kudo M. Kaipia A. Kobilka B. Hsueh A.J. Mol. Endocrinol. 1997; 11: 1659-1668Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar) is a kind gift of Dr. A. W. Hsueh. In this hybrid, Cys1-Asp341 was fused to the transmembrane and cytoplasmic domains of CD8 via the thrombin cleavage sequence linker. Plasmids were transfected into human embryonic kidney (HEK) 293 cells by the calcium phosphate method. Stable cell lines were established in minimum essential medium containing 10% horse serum and 500 μg/ml of G-418, and then used for hormone binding and cAMP assay. All assays were carried out in duplicate and repeated 4–6 times. Means and standard variations were calculated and analyzed by Student'st test. In addition, values for mutants were compared with the corresponding values of the wild type receptor using analysis of variance with 95% confidence to determine the statistical significance of differences as detailed in the figure legends. Human FSH (the National Hormone and Pituitary Program) was radioiodinated as described previously for radioiodination of human CG (20Ji I. Ji T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1981; 78: 5465-5469Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). Stable cells were assayed for 125I-FSH binding in the presence of increasing concentrations of nonradioactive FSH. TheK d values were determined by Scatchard plots. Truncated exodomain was solubilized in Nonidet P-40 and assayed for hormone binding as described previously (16Ryu K. Lee H. Kim S. Beauchamp J. Tung C. Isaacs N.W. Ji I. Ji T.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 6285-6291Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). For intracellular cAMP assay, cells were washed twice with Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium and incubated in the medium containing isobutylmethylxanthine (0.1 mg/ml) for 15 min. Increasing concentrations of FSH were then added, and the incubation was continued for 45 min at 37 °C. After removing the medium, the cells were rinsed once with fresh medium without isobutylmethylxanthine, lysed in 70% ethanol, freeze–thawed in liquid nitrogen, and scraped. After pelleting cell debris at 16,000 × g for 10 min at 4°, the supernatant was collected, dried under vacuum, and resuspended in 10 μl of the cAMP assay buffer that was provided by the manufacturer. cAMP concentrations were determined with an 125I-cAMP assay kit (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) following the manufacturer's instruction and validated for use in our laboratory. Computer models of exoloop 3 were built using a method similar to that developed for modeling nucleic acid loop structures (21Tung C. Biophys. J. 1997; 72: 876-885Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar). Crystal structure of the seven helix bundle from bacteriorhodopsin (22Grigorieff N. Ceska T.A. Downing K.H. Baldwin J.M. Henderson R. J. Mol. Biol. 1997; 259: 393-421Crossref Scopus (876) Google Scholar) was used for anchoring the loop. Using a reduced coordinates approach, random loop structures with the targeted pair of fixed ends were generated. Those loop structures with energies below a threshold were selected and subjected to a short run of energy equilibration using Metropolis Monte Carlo simulation (21Tung C. Biophys. J. 1997; 72: 876-885Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar), and then 1,000 cycles of energy minimization using AMBER (23Weiner S. Kollman P. Case D. Chandra-Singh U. Ghio C. Algona G. Profeta S.J. Weiner P. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1984; 106: 765-784Crossref Scopus (4895) Google Scholar). The exodomain of the FSH receptor was truncated by placing a stop codon after Asp341, and the truncated exodomain, Cys1-Asp341, was expressed in HEK 293 cells. Because the exodomain remains within the cells and is not secreted, the cells expressing it were solubilized in Nonidet P-40 and assayed for125I-FSH binding in the presence of increasing concentrations of unlabeled FSH. The K d value was slightly less than the K d value of the wild type receptor solubilized in the detergent. There are three possible differences in the truncated exodomain and the exodomain in the wild type receptor: the location, the tethering to a transmembrane domain, and the structure. The truncated exodomain is present within the cell and not attached to the membrane, whereas the exodomain of the wild type receptor is present on the cell surface and tethered to the membrane. To test whether these differences influenced the hormone binding affinity of the truncated exodomain, we used a hybrid FSH receptor in which the exodomain, Cys1-Asp341, was attached to the transmembrane and cytoplasmic domain of CD8. Cells transiently transfected with the hybrid or the wild type receptor were incubated with125I-FSH in the presence of increasing concentrations of unlabeled FSH. After washing the cells, the bound radioactivity was measured and analyzed for Scatchard plot (Fig. 2). The hybrid was not only expressed on the cell surface but also bound FSH on intact cells with aK d value of 2.54 nm. ThisK d value is >3-fold less than theK d value 8.3 nm of the wild type receptor on intact cells, indicating a >3-fold increase in the binding affinity of the hybrid. The result shows that the location and tethering to the membrane of the exodomain did not cause the difference in the binding affinities of the hybrid and the wild type receptor. Next, we considered structural differences. The major difference between the hybrid and wild type receptor is the lack of the endodomain in the hybrid. It is possible that the endodomain may interact with the exodomain and influence FSH binding to the exodomain. Such an interaction is likely to occur at the extracellular surface of the endodomain, which is primarily comprised of exoloops. As a first step to identifying such a region, we decided to examine the shortest of the 3 exoloops, exoloop 3. Exoloop 3 of the human FSH consists of 11 amino acids, Lys580, Val581, Pro582, Leu583, Ile584, Thr585, Val586, Ser587, Lys588, Ala589, and Lys590. Ten of them except Ala589 were individually substituted with Ala to produce 10 substitution mutants, Lys580 → Ala, Val581→ Ala, Pro582 → Ala, Leu583 → Ala, Ile584 → Ala, Thr585 → Ala, Val586 → Ala, Ser587 → Ala, Lys588 → Ala, and Lys590 → Ala. In addition, Ala589 was substituted with Gly to produce the Ala589 → Gly mutant. Cells transfected with the Lys580 → Ala, Val581 → Ala, and Pro582 → Ala mutant receptor cDNAs were capable of binding 125I-FSH, indicating surface expression of the mutant receptors (Fig. 3). Their surface concentrations were 12,000–35,000 receptors/cell as compared with 77,000 receptors/cell for the wild type receptor. The mutant receptors showed K d values in the range of 4–8.2 nm (p < 0.01–0.001) as compared with theK d value of 8 nm for the wild type receptor. The K d values of Lys580 → Ala and Pro582 → Ala were ∼50% of the wild type receptor's K d value, indicating a ∼2-fold improvement in the hormone binding affinity. In contrast to the improved binding affinities, the cAMP level produced by these two mutants was only 13–16% of the wild type value (Fig. 3 C). These levels are also lower than the cAMP level of Val581→ Ala, which is 58% of the wild type value. These results suggest an inverse relationship between the binding affinity of and maximum cAMP level induced by Lys580 → Ala and Pro582 → Ala. Next, Leu583 → Ala and Ile584 → Ala mutants were examined (Fig. 4). Ala substitution for Leu583 or Ile584 dramatically improved the hormone binding affinity by 4.4- or 5.7-fold, respectively. In contrast, the mutants were incapable of inducing cAMP. Interestingly, the maximum cAMP levels were not affected by the surface concentration of receptors when the receptors were transiently expressed at varying concentrations on the surface of HEK 293 cells (Table I). This is consistent with the fact that cAMP was maximally induced at the FSH concentration range of ∼5–50 nm, which is below the FSH concentration (>50 nm) necessary for the maximum (saturation) FSH binding of the wild type receptor (Fig. 4). Apparently, the limiting factor(s) for cAMP induction is associated with G protein or adenylyl cyclase.Table INo effect of the receptor concentration on the maximum cAMP levelReceptors/CellMax cAMPfmol/103 cellsWild type20,30066.8 ± 634,50074.4 ± 277,40062.7 ± 4116,60068.8 ± 2Leu583 → Ala6,200NS9,600NS17,500NSIle585 → Ala1,900NS6,800NS8,400NS17,900NSVarying concentrations of the receptors were expressed on the surface of HEK 293 cells by transiently transfecting cells with different concentrations of plasmids.

Ala substitutions for the next three amino acids, Thr585→ Ala, Val586 → Ala, and Ser587 → Ala, did not significantly affect the hormone binding affinity but increased the EC50 values for cAMP induction by ∼10-fold (Fig. 5). Despite the significant decrease in the affinity for cAMP induction, the mutant receptors produced FSH-induced cAMP at 22–85% of the wild type level. Substitutions for the last 3 amino acids of exoloop 3, Lys588 → Ala, Ala589 → Gly, and Lys590 → Ala, had mixed results (Fig. 6). Lys588 → Ala had no effect in the K d value but negative effects on the EC50 value and maximum cAMP level. In the case of Ala589 → Gly, the binding affinity increased by >2-fold, whereas the potency of cAMP induction and maximum cAMP level decreased. On the other hand, Lys590 → Ala completely abolished the cAMP induction activity without affecting hormone binding.Figure 6Substitutional analysis of Lys588-Lys590 of exoloop 3.Lys588 and Lys590 of exoloop 3 individually were substituted with Ala and Ala589 with Gly.

In contrast to mutants' lower or similarK d values, the affinity and the maximum level of cAMP induction by all mutants were less than the values of the wild type. In addition, the basal cAMP level of these mutants were also below that of the wild type. One exception is the Ser587→ Ala mutant of which maximum and basal cAMP levels were similar to those of the wild type receptor. These results indicate the importance of exoloop 3 in cAMP induction and the negative effect of the substitutions on cAMP induction. Our site-directed mutagenesis uses synthetic oligonucleotides containing a mutant sequence for each mutation and further, does not involve polymerase chain reaction. After mutagenesis, the mutant and flanking sequences are verified by sequencing. In addition, the same sequence is confirmed once more after a mutant cDNA is subcloned into the expression vector. Therefore, it is highly unlikely that a mutant cDNA might have undergone an unintended mutation(s) during the mutagenesis and subcloning. To confirm this mutation, cDNAs were reverted to the wild type cDNA, which, in turn, was used to transfect cells. All of the revertants behaved the same as the wild type receptor in surface expression, hormone binding, and cAMP induction (data not included), indicating that there was no mutations other than the intended substitutions. To readily compare various results of the hormone binding affinity and maximum cAMP level, each mutant's percent values relative to the values of the wild type were generated as described in Fig. 7: the higher the percent values of K d, the better the affinities for hormone binding. Ala substitutions for Lys580, Pro582, Leu583, and Ile584 augmented the binding affinity but attenuated the maximum cAMP level. Particularly, Leu583 → Ala and Ile584 → Ala substitutions increased the binding affinities by 4–6-fold, respectively, while completely abolishing cAMP induction. These results highlight an apparent inverse relationship between hormone binding and cAMP induction. This inverse relationship is independent of receptor concentrations and specific for the 4 residues. Therefore, they may have been compromised to preserve cAMP inducibility while maintaining a reasonably high binding affinity in the wild type receptor. If so, the Ala substitutions relieve the constraint and improve hormone binding while attenuating cAMP induction. In contrast to the Leu583 → Ala and Ile584→ Ala substitutions, Lys590 → Ala substitution abolished cAMP induction without impacting hormone binding. This suggests that the essential role of Lys590 → Ala in cAMP induction differs from that of Leu583 and Ile584. On the other hand, Ala substitutions for the 4 amino acids in the Thr585-Lys588 sequence showed no or marginal effect on hormone binding and some effects on cAMP induction. These results suggest that the exoloop 3 residues are differentially impacted by Ala substitution and could be classified into four groups. Leu583 → Ala and Ile584 → Ala dramatically improved the binding affinity but abolished cAMP induction. Lys580 → Ala and Pro582 → Ala improved the binding affinity and attenuated the cAMP induction affinity and the maximum and basal cAMP levels. The rest of the substitutions had no significant effect on hormone binding. For example, Lys590 → Ala abolished cAMP induction with no effect on hormone binding. Ala substitutions for Thr585-Lys588 had some effects on cAMP induction without significantly affecting hormone binding. The results raise an interesting question: does exoloop 3 assume a structure more favorable for cAMP induction than hormone binding? For example, Leu583 and Ile584 are crucial for cAMP induction, yet along with Lys580 and Pro582, they appear to attenuate the hormone binding affinity. To help envision such a structure and to test whether the structure is possible, exoloop 3 was modeled (Fig. 8). Exoloop 3 was anchored to transmembrane domains 6 and 7 of bacteriorhodopsin (22Grigorieff N. Ceska T.A. Downing K.H. Baldwin J.M. Henderson R. J. Mol. Biol. 1997; 259: 393-421Crossref Scopus (876) Google Scholar). We focused on Lys580, Pro582, Leu583, and Ile584 for which Ala substitutions improved the binding affinity. These 4 residues appear on one side of exoloop 3, consistent with our experimental results. The FSH receptor and LH/CG receptor are closely related in their structure and function as are FSH and LH/CG. Exoloop 3 of both receptors are comprised of 11 amino acids, 8 of which are identical (Table II). Despite these similarities, the impact of certain Ala substitutions on the affinities of hormone binding and cAMP induction were significantly different. Leu583 → Ala and Ile584 → Ala enhanced the hormone binding affinity by ∼4–6-fold for the FSH receptor but the corresponding substitutions slightly changed the binding affinity for the LH/CG receptor (24Ryu K.-S. Gilchrist R.L. Ji I. Kim S.-J. Ji T.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 7301-7304Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). In addition, the same substitutions abolished cAMP induction for the FSH receptor but not for the LH/CG receptor. Conversely, Lys588 → Ala did not impact the binding affinity of the FSH receptor, but the Ala substitution for the corresponding Asn in the LH/CG receptor enhanced the binding affinity by 3.6-fold. These results indicate the structural and functional differences of exoloop 3 of the two receptors. These differential effects seem to be specific, because other substitutions did not have them. For instance, Val581 → Ala impacted similarly for both receptors. In addition, Lys590 → Ala in both the FSH receptor and LH/CG receptor totally abolished cAMP induction without impacting hormone binding and surface expression.Table IIPercent Kd and maximum cAMP values for exoloop 3 mutants of the FSH receptor and LH/CG receptorBindingMax cAMPFSH-RLH/CG-RFSH-RLH/CG-R% Kd%Wild type100100100100Lys5801861431388Val58196705895Pro582200921628Leu583444128077Ile584571133074Thr585881313983Val58670932253Ser587 → Thr831018583Lys588 → Asn953355480Ala589 → Ser2421063795Lys59011616800The FSH receptor and LH/CG receptor share the identical amino acid sequence except the 3 residues near the C terminus.

Percent maximum cAMP values were calculated by dividing maximum cAMP of each FSH receptor mutant with that of the wild type receptor. Ala substitutional analyses indicate that exoloop 3 amino acids of the FSH receptor play crucial but differential roles in hormone binding and cAMP induction. Particularly, 4 N-terminal residues, Lys580, Pro581, Leu583, and Ile584, may be clustered at one side of exoloop 3 and are crucial for cAMP induction and constrain hormone binding to the exodomain. The mechanisms for these two essential receptor functions appear to work against each other. Therefore, hormone binding might be compromised to preserve cAMP inducibility while maintaining a reasonably high, but below maximum, binding affinity. In contrast to the 4 residues, other amino acids function differently, suggesting that the exoloop 3 residues assume a structure that differentially influences hormone binding and cAMP induction. Exoloop 3 of the FSH receptor and LH/CG receptor shares the same size and high sequence homology. However, their influences on hormone binding and cAMP induction are strikingly different, indicating the receptor specificity of exoloop 3."

The catabolic pathways of human APP were studied 3 to 4 days after infection, when the equilibrium of APP production was reached. Although the expression of human wild type APP (WtAPP) by rat neurons induced the production of both extracellular and intraneuronal amyloid peptide (Aβ), Aβ was not detected in the culture medium of rat astrocytes producing human WtAPP. Because a low β-secretase activity was previously reported in rodent astrocytes, we wondered whether modifications of the APP amino acid sequence at the β-secretase clipping site would modify the astrocytic production of Aβ. Interestingly, rat astrocytes produced high amounts of Aβ after expression of human APP carrying a double amino acid substitution responsible for Alzheimer's disease in a large Swedish family (SwAPP). In both rat cortical neurons and astrocytes, the β-secretase cleavage of the human SwAPP occurred very early in the secretion process in a cellular compartment in which a different sorting of SwAPP and WtAPP seems unlikely. These results suggest that human WtAPP and SwAPP could be processed by different β-secretase activities.

Alzheimer's disease is the most common form of dementia. The major hallmarks of this neurodegenerative disorder are intraneuronal neurofibrillary tangles as well as senile plaques containing an extracellular amyloid core associated with reactive astrocytes (1Pike C.J. Cummings B.J. Cotman C.W. Exp. Neurol. 1995; 132: 172-179Crossref PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar). The amyloid peptide (Aβ)1 is the major constituent of the amyloid deposits (2Masters C.L. Simms G. Weinman N.A. Multhaup G. McDonald B.L. Beyreuther K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci U. S. A. 1985; 82: 4245-4249Crossref PubMed Scopus (3683) Google Scholar) and is derived from the amyloid precursor protein (APP) (3Kang J. Lemaire H.G. Unterbeck A. Salbaum J.M. Masters C.L. Grzeschik K.H. Multhaup G. Beyreuther K. Muller-Hill B. Nature. 1987; 325: 733-736Crossref PubMed Scopus (3957) Google Scholar). The processing of human APP has been widely studied in transfected cells (4Weidemann A. Konig G. Bunke D. Fischer P. Salbaum J.M. Masters C.L. Beyreuther K. Cell. 1989; 57: 115-126Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1038) Google Scholar, 5Octave J.N. Rev. Neurosci. 1995; 6: 287-316Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). These cellular models have identified different proteolytic pathways for the processing of APP. A portion of APP is cleaved by α-secretase within the Aβ region. This non-amyloidogenic pathway, which precludes the formation of full-length Aβ, occurs during the processing of APP to the plasma membrane as early as in the trans-Golgi network (6De Strooper B. Umans L. Van Leuven F. Van Den Berghe H. J. Cell Biol. 1993; 121: 295-304Crossref PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar, 7Kuentzel S.L. Ali S.M. Altman R.A. Greenberg B.D. Raub T.J. Biochem. J. 1993; 295: 367-378Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar). This cleavage releases the N-terminal ectodomain of APP containing the first 17 amino acids of Aβ into the culture medium of transfected cells. Another fraction of newly synthesized APP appears at the plasma membrane. Following endocytosis of this transmembrane APP, the cleavage by β-secretase at the N terminus of Aβ generates a C-terminal fragment of APP that contains the entire Aβ sequence. A second protease activity called γ-secretase cleaves this C-terminal fragment of APP to release the full-length amyloid peptide, which is detected in the extracellular medium (8Haass C. Schlossmachern M.G. Hung A.Y. Vigo-Pelfrey C. Mellon A. Ostaszewski B.L. Lieberburg I. Koo E.H. Schenk D. Teplow D.B. Selkoe D.J. Nature. 1992; 359: 322-325Crossref PubMed Scopus (1765) Google Scholar). In transfected cells, the cellular trafficking of APP plays a key role in the choice between the two catabolic pathways of the protein, since the non-amyloidogenic pathway occurs during the processing of APP to the plasma membrane, whereas endocytosis of APP is required for Aβ production (9Essalmani R. Macq A.F. Mercken L. Octave J.N. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1996; 218: 89-96Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). Because the intracellular trafficking of APP in transfected cells could be completely different from that in neuronal cells, it was important to study the metabolism of APP in neuronal cells. So far as neuronal cells are concerned, two cellular models have been recently utilized. Cell lines derived from neuroblastoma (10Thinakaran G. Teplow D.B. Siman R. Greenberg B. Sisodia S.S. J. Biol.

Ida N. Multhaup G. Masters C.L. Van Leuven F. Beyreuther K. Dotti C.G. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 5218-5229Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar). Primary cultures of rat hippocampal neurons have also been used to express human APP following infection by a recombinant SFV. The SFV system allows sufficient amounts of human APP to be produced for biochemical analysis. In this way, it was possible to demonstrate that primary cultures of rat hippocampal neurons produce human extracellular and intracellular Aβ by different mechanisms (14Tienari P.J. Ida N. Ikonen E. Simons M. Weidemann A. Multhaup G. Masters C.L. Dotti C.G. Beyreuther K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 4125-4130Crossref PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar). At least one intraneuronal location for β-cleavage of human APP is within the endoplasmic reticulum (15Hartmann T. Bieger S.C. Brühl B Tienari P.J. Ida N. Allsop D. Roberts G.W. Masters C.L. Dotti C.G. Unsicker K. Beyreuther K. Nat. Med. 1997; 3: 1016-1020Crossref PubMed Scopus (646) Google Scholar). It is therefore evident that rat neurons process human APP differently from transfected cells. Although the SFV system allows a high production of human APP into neuronal cells, it induces a pronounced cytopathic effect a few hours after infection (16Olkkonen V.M. Liljestrom P. Garoff H. Simons K. Dotti C.G. J. Neurosci. Res. 1993; 35: 445-451Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). The influence of this cytopathic effect on the short term expression and metabolism of APP remains questionable. In addition, glial cells are infected much less efficiently with recombinant SFV than are neurons (12Simons M.J. de Strooper B. Multhaup G. Tienari P.J. Dotti C.G. Beyreuther K. J. Neurosci. 1996; 16: 899-908Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), making a comparison between glial cells and neuronal cells rather difficult. We have constructed recombinant adenoviruses that allow the long term expression of human APP into primary cultures of rat cortical neurons and astrocytes without cytopathic effect. We found that human wild type APP (WtAPP) is processed in a distinct manner in rat cortical neurons and astrocytes. Although rat cortical neurons produce both extracellular and intracellular Aβ from human WtAPP, the amyloidogenic pathway of human WtAPP was not detected in astrocytes. On the contrary, astrocytes produce high amounts of Aβ from human APP carrying a double amino acid substitution responsible for Alzheimer's disease in a Swedish family (SwAPP). In both neurons and astrocytes, the β-cleavage of SwAPP occurs early in the secretion process. This suggests that WtAPP and SwAPP could be processed by different β-secretase activities.

Invest. 1992; 90: 626-630Crossref PubMed Scopus (574) Google Scholar). AdRSVβ-gal carries the LacZ reporter gene under the transcriptional control of the long terminal repeat of the Rous sarcoma virus (RSV). AdRSVWtAPP carries the human APP 695 cDNA sequence, and AdRSVSwAPP is the same vector containing the Swedish double mutation (Lys to Asn at position 595 and Met to Leu at position 596 of APP 695) (24Mullan M. Crawford F. Axelman K. Houlden H. Lilius L. Winblad B. Lannfelt L. Nat. Genet. 1992; 1: 345-347Crossref PubMed Scopus (1198) Google Scholar). Recombinant adenoviruses were generated in 293 transformed human kidney cells by homologous recombination between a plasmid containing the transgene and the large ClaI fragment of the Ad5dl324 viral DNA, as described previously (23Stratford-Perricaudet L.D. Makeh I. Perricaudet M. Brian P. J. Clin. Invest. 1992; 90: 626-630Crossref PubMed Scopus (574) Google Scholar). Recombinant viruses were purified from isolated plaques, and viral DNA was prepared. Recombinant adenoviruses containing the transgene were identified by both restriction fragment analysis and PCR, amplified, and tested for the transgene expression. Viral preparations were purified by two CsCl gradient centrifugations, dialyzed against buffer containing 10 mm Tris-Cl, pH 7.5, 1 mmMgCl2, and 135 mm NaCl and stored in 10% glycerol at −80 °C. The viral titer was determined by plaque assay on 911 cells (25Fallaux F.J. Kranenburg O. Cramer S.J. Houweling A. Van Ormondt H. Hoeben R.C. Van Der Eb A.J. Hum. Gene Ther. 1996; 7: 215-222Crossref PubMed Scopus (443) Google Scholar) and expressed as plaque formation units/ml. Infection of cultured cells by recombinant adenovirus was performed during 1 h at 37 °C in a small volume of culture medium. Infected cells were thereafter reincubated in a fresh culture medium, and the expression of the recombinant proteins was measured during the following days. For the detection of β-galactosidase activity, cells were washed with phosphate-buffered saline, fixed in 2% formaldehyde, and 0.05% glutaraldehyde for 5 min and incubated with X-gal solution (5 mm potassium ferricyanide, 5 mm potassium ferrocyanide, 2 mmMgCl2, 1 mg/ml 5-bromo-4-chloro-3-indolyl β-d-galactopyranoside in phosphate-buffered saline) for 12 h. Cells expressing the β-galactosidase were detected by the presence of a blue coloration located in the nucleus. Following the β-galactosidase detection, neurons in cultures were identified by the immunocytochemical detection of the microtubule-associated protein 2, and astrocytes were detected using an anti-glial fibrillary acid protein antibody. After rinsing in phosphate-buffered saline, the endogenous peroxidase activity was blocked by incubation in 0.3% H2O2 in Tris-buffered saline (TBS) for 10 min. After two incubations (10 min) in a solution of 0.1% Triton X-100 in TBS, cells were incubated for 10 min in 0.5% sodium borohydride in TBS. Cells were then incubated for 16 h with the primary antibody (anti-microtubule-associated protein 2:anti-serum B9 or with an anti-glial fibrillary acid protein:polyclonal antibody Dako; Denmark) diluted 1/800 in TBS containing 1% fetal calf serum. After two washes in TBS, cells were sequentially incubated with swine anti-rabbit antibodies (Dako-Denmark) (diluted 1/100) for 1 h, washed, incubated with the peroxidase-antiperoxidase complex (Dako-Denmark) (diluted 1/100) for 1 h, and revealed in diaminobenzidine (0.03% in 0.05 m Tris-HCl, pH 7.6, 10 mm imidazole, 0.015% H2O2). The β-galactosidase activity was quantified in cell extracts solubilized in 1% deoxycholate by spectrophotometry at 420 nm following the metabolization of o-nitrophenyl β-d-galactopyranoside as described (26Hall C.V. Jacob P.E. Ringold G.M. Lee F. J. Mol. Appl. Genet. 1983; 2: 101-109PubMed Google Scholar). APP metabolites were analyzed by immunoprecipitation and Western blot as described (27Czech C. Delaere P. Macq A.F. Reibaud M. Dreisler S. Touchet N. Schombert B. Mazadier M. Mercken L. Theisen M. Pradier L. Octave J.N. Beyreuther K. Tremp G. Brain. Res. Mol. Brain. Res. 1997; 47: 108-116Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). Neurons and astrocytes cultured on 3-cm dishes were infected with either AdRSVWtAPP or AdRSVSwAPP. The culture medium and the cellular extracts were harvested during the following days. The protein concentration in cell lysates was measured using the BCA method (Pierce-USA) and bovine serum albumin as a standard. Human APP was detected in Western blot analysis of 25 μg of cell lysate proteins or 25 μl of culture medium with the 3H5 (19Philippe B. Brion J.P. Macq A.F. Octave J.N. J. Neurosci.

Human Aβ was detected by immunoprecipitation of 1 ml of culture medium or 1 mg of cell lysate proteins with the L6 or FCA18 (18Barelli H. Lebeau A. Vizzavona J. Delaere P. Chevallier N. Drouot C.

The immunoprecipitate was analyzed by Western blot on a 4–12% Nupage gel (NOVEX-USA) using the WO2 (20Ida N. Hartmann T Pantel J. Schroder J. Zerfass R. Forstl H. Sandbrink R. Masters C.L. Beyreuther K. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 22908-22914Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (474) Google Scholar) antibody. APP was quantified in immunoblotting experiments using the 3H5 monoclonal antibody (19Philippe B. Brion J.P. Macq A.F. Octave J.N. J. Neurosci. Res. 1996; 46: 709-719Crossref PubMed Scopus (7) Google Scholar), a secondary 125I-labeled goat anti-mouse Ig (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech-Nederland) and exposure of immunoblots to phosphorimaging plates (Cyclone, Packard Instrument Co.). The same batch of radiolabeled antibody was used to quantify Aβ immunoprecipitated by the L6 anti-Aβ serum and detected in immunoblotting by the WO2 monoclonal antibody (20Ida N. Hartmann T Pantel J. Schroder J. Zerfass R. Forstl H. Sandbrink R. Masters C.L. Beyreuther K. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 22908-22914Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (474) Google Scholar). A standard curve (r = 0.9987) was generated by immunoprecipitation and immunoblotting of appropriate synthetic Aβ standards diluted in the same volume of identical culture medium. Quantification of immunoblots was performed using the Optiquant software. Recombinant adenoviruses were used as an expression system in primary cultures of both rat cortical neurons and astrocytes as described previously (28Maron A. Havaux N. Le Roux A. Knoops B. Perricaudet M. Octave J.N. Gene Ther. 1997; 4: 25-31Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar). To compare in details the relative efficiency of infection by this vector, rat cortical neurons and astrocytes were infected by a recombinant adenovirus carrying the LacZ gene (AdRSVβ-gal) at different multiplicities of infection, and the β-galactosidase activity was revealed by histochemistry. Thereafter, neurons were identified by immunocytochemical detection of microtubule-associated protein 2 using an anti-microtubule-associated protein 2 serum, whereas astrocytes were specifically labeled by an anti-anti-glial fibrillary acid protein serum. Those labeling demonstrated that more than 99% of the cells correspond to either neurons or astrocytes. Rat cortical neurons were cultured for 7 days before infection by recombinant adenoviruses. The β-galactosidase activity was observed in the nucleus of infected cells (Fig. 1,A and B) as a result from the fusion of the β-galactosidase with a nuclear localization signal. 63 ± 4% (n = 25) of neurons express β-galactosidase following infection by AdRSVβ-gal at a multiplicity of infection of 10, whereas 59 ± 10% (n = 25) of astrocytes showed a blue nucleus at a multiplicity of infection of 1. These results indicate therefore that the relative efficiency of infection by AdRSVβ-gal is about 10 times higher in astrocytes than in neurons. The production of β-galactosidase was measured as a function of time in rat cortical neurons infected by AdRSVβ-gal using o-nitrophenyl β-d-galactopyranoside as a substrate (26Hall C.V. Jacob P.E. Ringold G.M. Lee F. J. Mol. Appl. Genet. 1983; 2: 101-109PubMed Google Scholar). The results presented in Fig. 1 C indicate that the production of β-galactosidase activity increases up to 4 days after infection before reaching a plateau. The kinetics of production of β-galactosidase was identical in both astrocytes and neurons, and the β-galactosidase activity remained stable up to 7 days after infection (not shown). Four days after infection, the amount of β-galactosidase produced by astrocytes was two times higher as compared with neurons, although about 60% of both cell types expressed the transgene. This suggests that the RSV promoter is more efficient in astrocytes than in neurons. Because the recombinant adenoviruses allow the long term expression of proteins in neurons and astrocytes without important toxicity, they were used as an expression system to study the neuronal and astrocytic metabolism of human APP. Rat cortical neurons were infected by the AdRSVWtAPP recombinant adenovirus carrying the human APP 695 cDNA sequence. The production of human WtAPP in the culture medium as well as in the cellular extract was analyzed by Western blot, using the WO2 monoclonal antibody recognizing the Aβ 5–8 amino acid sequence (20Ida N. Hartmann T Pantel J. Schroder J. Zerfass R. Forstl H. Sandbrink R. Masters C.L. Beyreuther K. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 22908-22914Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (474) Google Scholar). The production of intraneuronal human APP reached a maximum 2 days after infection, whereas the production of extracellular human WtAPP increased up to 3 days after infection (Fig. 2). Although rat cortical neurons produce endogenous APP, this protein was not detected by the WO2 monoclonal antibody, which is specific for the human Aβ sequence (20Ida N. Hartmann T Pantel J. Schroder J. Zerfass R. Forstl H. Sandbrink R. Masters C.L. Beyreuther K. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 22908-22914Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (474) Google Scholar). It has been previously shown that rodent-cultured neurons are not able to efficiently process rodent APP into Aβ (29De Strooper B. Simons M. Multhaup G. Van Leuven F. Beyreuther K. Dotti C.G. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 4932-4938Crossref PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar). However, when rat cortical neurons were infected by AdRSVWtAPP, they produced extracellular human Aβ (Fig. 2). The kinetic of production of extracellular Aβ (Fig. 2) was very similar to that of APP and was maximal after 3 days of infection. This human APP and Aβ production remained stable as long as the cells survived in culture (up to 7 days after infection). Rat cortical neurons expressing human APP were also able to produce intracellular Aβ (Fig. 3). The production of intraneuronal Aβ has been previously reported in rat-cultured neurons infected by a SFV recombinant for human APP (26Hall C.V. Jacob P.E. Ringold G.M. Lee F. J. Mol. Appl. Genet. 1983; 2: 101-109PubMed Google Scholar). Because of the cytopathic effect of the SFV system, the expression of human APP can be measured only during a very short period of time. Using recombinant adenovirus, we measured the production of intraneuronal Aβ 3 days after infection, when the production of human APP reached a plateau. Interestingly enough, the production of both extracellular and intracellular Aβ by rat cortical neurons during several days did not induce significant neuronal modification.Figure 3Generation of intracellular Aβ by rat cortical neurons infected by AdRSVWtAPP. Rat cortical neurons were infected by AdRSVWtAPP. Three days after infection, the infected cells were lysed, and 1 mg of cellular proteins were immunoprecipitated with the L6 polyclonal anti-Aβ serum. The immunoprecipitate was analyzed by Western blot using the WO2 monoclonal antibody.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) When rat-cultured astrocytes were infected by AdRSVWtAPP, human WtAPP was found in both cellular extract and culture medium (Fig. 4). The production of intracellular and extracellular human APP by infected rat astrocytes showed a kinetics very similar to that observed in infected neurons. Although human WtAPP was produced by rat astrocytes to levels comparable with neurons, Aβ was undetectable in both cellular extracts and culture medium (Fig. 4). This absence of Aβ in rat astrocytes expressing human WtAPP could result from the rapid degradation of the amyloid peptide. To test this hypothesis, rat astrocytes were incubated for 24 h at 37 °C in the presence of the culture medium of a transfected CHO cell line that expresses human APP and produces high amounts of extracellular Aβ (9Essalmani R. Macq A.F. Mercken L. Octave J.N. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1996; 218: 89-96Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). After this incubation, human Aβ was recovered by immunoprecipitation of the culture medium, indicating that Aβ produced by CHO cells was not degraded by rat astrocytes (not shown). These results clearly demonstrate that whereas rat astrocytes process human WtAPP in the non-amyloidogenic pathway, the human Aβ is not detected in these cells. This suggests that β- and/or γ-secretase(s), which cleave(s) human WtAPP is/are not present or very inefficient in rat astrocytes. The astrocytic β-secretase activity has been previously reported to be very inefficient (30Zhao J. Paganini L. Mucke L. Gordon M. Refolo L. Carman M. Sinha S. Oltersdorf T. Lieberburg I. McConlogue L. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 31407-31411Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). We wondered whether modifications of the APP amino acid sequence at the β-secretase cleavage site could influence the production of Aβ by rat astrocytes. In a large Swedish family with Alzheimer's disease, the APP gene carries a double amino acid substitution (24Mullan M. Crawford F. Axelman K. Houlden H. Lilius L. Winblad B. Lannfelt L. Nat. Genet. 1992; 1: 345-347Crossref PubMed Scopus (1198) Google Scholar) located close to the clipping site of the β-secretase, increasing the Aβ production up to 8-fold (31Citron M. Oltersdorf T. Haass C. McConlogue L. Hung A.Y. Seubert P. Vigo-Pelfrey C. Lieberburg I. Selkoe D.J. Nature. 1992; 360: 672-674Crossref PubMed Scopus (1537) Google Scholar). Human SwAPP was expressed in both rat-cultured neurons and astrocytes. Rat cortical neurons infected by AdRSVSwAPP produced intracellular and extracellular human SwAPP. The WO2 (20Ida N. Hartmann T Pantel J. Schroder J. Zerfass R. Forstl H. Sandbrink R. Masters C.L. Beyreuther K. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 22908-22914Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (474) Google Scholar) antibody, which specifically recognizes human Aβ, and the 3H5 (19Philippe B. Brion J.P. Macq A.F. Octave J.N. J. Neurosci. Res. 1996; 46: 709-719Crossref PubMed Scopus (7) Google Scholar) antibody, which specifically recognizes the anionic domain of human APP (20Ida N. Hartmann T Pantel J.

Chem. 1996; 271: 22908-22914Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (474) Google Scholar) (Fig. 5 A) were used in Western blot analysis of extracellular medium from neurons expressing either WtAPP or SwAPP. The results presented in Fig. 5 B show that the 3H5 antibody detected extracellular human SwAPP and WtAPP, part of the extracellular SwAPP being found at a lower molecular weight, as compared with the WtAPP. This shift in the molecular weight could result from a predominant β-secretase cleavage of the SwAPP. This was confirmed by the analysis of the same culture medium with the WO2 antibody, which only recognizes soluble APP resulting from the α-secretase cleavage. Levels of secreted SwAPP were indeed much lower than WtAPP when detected by the WO2 antibody. This indicates that in rat neurons, SwAPP favors the β-secretase cleavage at the expense of the α-secretase cleavage, as it has been previously reported in other cell types (10Thinakaran G. Teplow D.B. Siman R. Greenberg B. Sisodia S.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 9390-9397Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (282) Google Scholar). As compared with WtAPP, the expression of human SwAPP by rat cortical neurons significantly increased the production of Aβ in both the culture medium (Fig. 5 B) and the cellular extracts (not shown). Quantification of Aβ in the culture medium of rat neurons infected by AdRSVWtAPP or AdRSVSwAPP indicates that rat neurons expressing SwAPP secrete 6.4 times more Aβ as compared with neurons expressing WtAPP (Fig. 6 A). Human SwAPP was expressed in rat astrocytes. The resulting soluble SwAPP was also characterized by a faster migration in SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, as compared with the WtAPP (Fig. 5 C). The culture medium of rat astrocytes expressing human SwAPP was immunoprecipitated by the FCA18 anti-Aβ serum, which has an absolute requirement of the first aspartyl residue of the amyloid peptide (18Barelli H. Lebeau A. Vizzavona J. Delaere P. Chevallier N. Drouot C. Marambaud P. Ancolio K. Buxbaum J.D. Khorkova O. Heroux J. Sahasrabudhe S. Martinez J. Warter J.M. Mohr M. Checler F. Mol. Med. 1997; 3: 695-707Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Analysis of this immunoprecipitate in Western blot with the WO2 antibody clearly indicates that rat astrocytes expressing human SwAPP produce Aβ with an N-terminal sequence starting at Asp1. This β-cleavage of human SwAPP by rat astrocytes was also concomitant with a reduction of the α-cleavage, as demonstrated by the analysis of soluble WtAPP and SwAPP with the WO2 antibody (Fig. 5 C). Quantification of Aβ in the culture medium of rat astrocytes infected by AdRSVSwAPP indicates that rat astrocytes expressing SwAPP secrete Aβ at levels that are 3.7-fold higher than those measured in the culture medium of neurons expressing WtAPP (Fig. 6 B). Four days after infection, the production of Aβ by astrocytes expressing SwAPP induced an important cellular toxicity, leading to a dramatic loss of cellular proteins. Although variations of the cellular protein content were measured between different cultures of astrocytes, a 95% loss of cellular proteins was measured 4 days after infection of rat astrocytes by AdRSVSwAPP, as compared with astrocytes expressing WtAPP at a similar level (Fig. 7). Altogether, these results demonstrate that the β-cleavage of human WtAPP is very inefficient in rat astrocytes. On the contrary, rat astrocytes contain a β-secretase that cleaves SwAPP with high efficiency. We have shown here that recombinant adenoviruses can be used to overexpress proteins in primary cultures of rat cortical neurons and astrocytes. The expression of the transgene can be maintained as long as the cells survive in culture. Although astrocytes are infected more efficiently with recombinant adenoviruses than are neurons, a very similar expression can be achieved in both cell types by using different multiplicities of infection. The use of a recombinant adenovirus carrying the human WtAPP 695 cDNA sequence allowed us to study the processing of human APP in rat-cultured neurons and astrocytes. The present paper is, to our knowledge, the first to study the long term expression and metabolism of human APP in both rat cortical neurons and astrocytes. Rat cortical neurons expressing human WtAPP produce extracellular and intracellular amyloid peptide during several days. This sustained production of amyloid peptide does not induce any significant neurotoxicity. Although rat-cultured astrocytes are able to produce high amounts of human WtAPP, we were unable to detect Aβ in both their culture medium and cellular extract. The lack of detection of Aβ in rat astrocytes expressing human WtAPP could be due to the level of sensitivity of our assay. However, immunoprecipitation of two times more culture medium or infection of astrocytes at a higher multiplicity of infection did not allow the detection of Aβ in the culture medium of rat astrocytes expressing the human WtAPP. Very recently, Aβ was quantified using enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay in the conditioned medium from either the NT2N cell line or astrocytes infected by SFV recombinant for human APP (11McPhie D.L. Lee R.K.K. Eckman C.B. Olstein D.H. Durham S.P. Yager D. Younkin S.G. Wurtman R.J. Neve R.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 24743-24746Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). The level of the production of Aβ by astrocytes corresponded to less than 10% that found for NT2N cells (11McPhie D.L. Lee R.K.K. Eckman C.B. Olstein D.H. Durham S.P. Yager D. Younkin S.G. Wurtman R.J. Neve R.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 24743-24746Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). We therefore conclude that human WtAPP is very inefficiently processed into Aβ by rat astrocytes. It has been previously reported that the β-secretase processing of the human APP is inefficient in astrocytes of transgenic mice (30Zhao J. Paganini L. Mucke L. Gordon M. Refolo L. Carman M. Sinha S. Oltersdorf T. Lieberburg I. McConlogue L. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 31407-31411Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). Because the Swedish mutation induces amino acid substitutions near the β-secretase cleavage site of APP, we decided to express human SwAPP in both rat neurons and astrocytes. When rat-cultured neurons express human SwAPP, an increased β-secretase processing was observed at the expense of the α-secretase cleavage. In addition, a 6.4-fold increase of Aβ secretion was measured as compared with WtAPP. Such an effect of the Swedish mutation was not observed in the NT2N cell line (11McPhie D.L. Lee R.K.K. Eckman C.B. Olstein D.H. Durham S.P. Yager D. Younkin S.G. Wurtman R.J. Neve R.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 24743-24746Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). Although rat astrocytes did not produce Aβ from human WtAPP, large amounts of Aβ were found in the culture medium of rat astrocytes expressing human SwAPP. The production of the amyloid peptide by rat cortical astrocytes induces a very important cellular toxicity. These results demonstrate therefore that, contrary to neurons, a sustained production of amyloid peptide by astrocytes induces a dramatic cellular toxicity. The production of Aβ from human SwAPP by rat astrocytes could have two explanations. Either the astrocytic β-secretase activity could be located in a cellular compartment that is accessible only to human SwAPP and not to WtAPP or the astrocytic β-secretase activity could cleave human SwAPP and not WtAPP. In both rat cortical neurons and astrocytes, the β-secretase cleavage of the human SwAPP occurs at the expense of the α-secretase cleavage. In mouse neuroblastoma N2a cells, the same observation allowed to conclude that the β-secretase cleavage of the SwAPP occurs in the medial compartment of the Golgi apparatus and disables APP molecules that would normally be cleaved by α-secretase (10Thinakaran G. Teplow D.B. Siman R. Greenberg B. Sisodia S.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 9390-9397Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (282) Google Scholar). Therefore, the β-secretase cleavage of human SwAPP by rat-cultured astrocytes has to occur very early in the secretion process in a cellular compartment in which a different sorting of WtAPP and SwAPP seems unlikely. Therefore, our results suggest that the amyloidogenic cleavage of human SwAPP in rat astrocytes is performed by a β-secretase that does not cleave the human WtAPP. In conclusion, we report here the long term expression of human Wt and SwAPP in rat cortical neurons and astrocytes, and we demonstrate that the Swedish mutation alters APP processing in both cell types. In neurons, SwAPP is processed in a pathway that increases the production of extracellular and intracellular Aβ. In astrocytes, the production of Aβ, resulting from the expression of SwAPP, induces an important cellular toxicity. The processing of human SwAPP by rat-cultured astrocytes uses a β-secretase activity, which is very inefficient on WtAPP. The dramatic effect of the Swedish mutation on the astrocytic processing of APP suggests that cell types other than neurons could contribute to elevate Aβ production in some FAD cases. It remains, however, that the recent identification of Aβ in the extracellular medium of primary cultures of human astrocytes (32Leblanc A.C. Papadopoulos M. Belair C. Chu W. Crosato M. Powell J. Goodyer C.G. J. Neurochem. 1997; 68: 1183-1190Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar) highlights an important difference between rodent and human astrocytes in the processing of human APP. Nevertheless, coexpression of human WtAPP and protease activities in rat astrocytes will be important for the further characterization and identification of β-secretase activities. We thank K. Beyreuther and F. Checler for the generous gift of the WO2 and FCA18 antibodies. B. Tasiaux is also acknowledged for her excellent technical assistance."
https://openalex.org/W2053858457,"The secondary structure of bacteriorhodopsin polypeptides comprising two (AB, CD, DE, FG), three (AC, CE, EG), four (AD, DG), or five (AE, CG) of the seven transmembrane segments has been analyzed by circular dichroism spectroscopy. A comparison of the alpha-helix content with that predicted from the high resolution structure of the native protein revealed that the N-terminal AB, AC, AD, and AE fragments and the C-terminal CG fragment are completely refolded in the presence of mixed phospholipid micelles. In contrast, the DG, EG, FG, CD, CE, and DE fragments did not form alpha-helices of the expected lengths at pH 6. Each of the latter fragments displayed, however, an increased helicity upon lowering the pH to 4. Fluorescence measurements with the CD and FG fragments suggest that this helix formation occurs within transmembrane segments C and G, respectively, and thus is likely to originate from the protonation of carboxyl residues that participate in proton translocation. The partial misfolding at neutral pH observed for the shorter fragments from the central and C-terminal part of bacteriorhodopsin indicates that the conformation of some transmembrane segments is specified by interactions with neighboring helices in the assembled structure. Moreover, the data demonstrate that two stable helices at the N terminus of a multihelical membrane protein are sufficient as a folding template to induce a native conformation to the following transmembrane domains."
https://openalex.org/W2123786244,"Three amino acid residues highly conserved in most proofreading DNA polymerases, a phenylalanine contained in the Exo II motif and a serine and a leucine belonging to the S/TLx2 h motif, were recently shown to be critical for 3′-5′ exonucleolysis by acting as single-stranded DNA ligands (de Vega, M., Lázaro, J.M., Salas, M. and Blanco, L. (1998) J. Mol. Biol. 279, 807–822). In this paper, site-directed mutants at these three residues were used to analyze their functional importance for the synthetic activities of ø29 DNA polymerase, an enzyme able to start linear ø29 DNA replication using a terminal protein (TP) as primer. Mutations introduced at Phe65, Ser122, and Leu123 residues of ø29 DNA polymerase severely affected the replication capacity of the enzyme. Three mutants, F65S, S122T, and S122N, were strongly affected in their capacity to interact with a DNA primer/template structure, suggesting a dual role during both polymerization and proofreading. Interestingly, mutant S122N was not able to maintain a stable interaction with the TP primer, thus impeding the firsts steps (initiation and transition) of ø29 DNA replication. The involvement of Ser122 in the consecutive binding of TP and DNA is compatible with the finding that the TP/DNA polymerase heterodimer was not able to use a DNA primer/template structure. Assuming a structural conservation among the eukaryotic-type DNA polymerases, a model for the interactions of ø29 DNA polymerase with both TP and DNA primers is presented. Three amino acid residues highly conserved in most proofreading DNA polymerases, a phenylalanine contained in the Exo II motif and a serine and a leucine belonging to the S/TLx2 h motif, were recently shown to be critical for 3′-5′ exonucleolysis by acting as single-stranded DNA ligands (de Vega, M., Lázaro, J.M., Salas, M. and Blanco, L.

Interestingly, mutant S122N was not able to maintain a stable interaction with the TP primer, thus impeding the firsts steps (initiation and transition) of ø29 DNA replication. The involvement of Ser122 in the consecutive binding of TP and DNA is compatible with the finding that the TP/DNA polymerase heterodimer was not able to use a DNA primer/template structure. Assuming a structural conservation among the eukaryotic-type DNA polymerases, a model for the interactions of ø29 DNA polymerase with both TP and DNA primers is presented. double-stranded DNA ø29 terminal protein TP covalently linked to ø29 DNA bovine serum albumin Klenow fragment of DNA polymerase I of Escherichia coli single-stranded DNA polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis.

This event occurs opposite the second 3′ nucleotide of the template, and then the initiation product (TP-dAMP) generated slides back one position to be paired to the terminal nucleotide (3Méndez J. Blanco L. Esteban J.A. Bernad A. Salas M. Proc. Natl. Acad. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 9579-9583Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). After sliding back, the same DNA polymerase molecule catalyzes the synthesis of a short elongation product (9 nucleotides) while it is still bound to the TP (transition step) (4Méndez J. Blanco L. Salas M. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 2519-2527Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). The incorporation of the next nucleotide forces dissociation of the TP/DNA polymerase heterodimer, starting normal DNA elongation initially coupled to strand displacement. Strand displacement synthesis proceeds from both DNA ends until the two replication forks meet. Then, the two partially replicated parental strands separate, and full-length DNA synthesis (19,285 base pairs in length) is completed. ø29 DNA polymerase is one of the smallest replicases known (66 kDa) containing well characterized enzymatic activities (reviewed in Ref.5Blanco L.

The functional importance of this residue was supported by site-directed mutagenesis analysis in ø29 DNA polymerase (49de Vega M. Ilyina T. Lázaro J.M. Salas M. Blanco L. J. Mol. Biol. 1997; 270: 65-78Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar) together with its invariant presence in the eukaryotic DNA polymerase family (48Wang J. Sattar A.K.M.A. Wang C.C. Karam J.D.

In addition to the residues involved in metal binding and catalysis at the 3′-5′ exonuclease active site, other residues are structurally and functionally conserved at the exonuclease domain of most proofreading DNA polymerases. Among them, ø29 DNA polymerase residues Thr15 and Asn62 of the Exo I and II motifs, respectively, were shown to act as ssDNA ligands, having a critical role in the stabilization of the primer terminus at the 3′-5′ exonuclease active site (50de Vega M. Lázaro J.M. Salas M. Blanco L. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 1182-1192Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). Another highly conserved residue at the Exo II motif (Phe65 in ø29 DNA polymerase) and two residues (Ser122 and Leu123) belonging to the newly identified S/TLx2 h motif were shown to act also as ssDNA ligands for 3′-5′ exonucleolysis (51de Vega M. Lázaro J.M. Salas M. Blanco L. J. Mol. Biol. 1998; 279: 807-822Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar), in agreement with the crystallographic data from T4 (47Wang J., Yu, P. Lin T.C.

To date, in the case of ø29 DNA polymerase, none of the mutations carried out at both metal and ssDNA ligands affected the synthetic activities of the enzyme (protein-primed initiation and DNA polymerization). However, as described in this paper, a detailed biochemical characterization of various mutants at the ssDNA ligands Phe65, Ser122, and Leu123 of ø29 DNA polymerase demonstrated the involvement of these residues also in primer (both DNA and TP) binding during the synthetic reactions. Based on these data, and assuming conservation of the overall structure among eukaryotic-type DNA polymerases, a three-dimensional structure prediction for the ø29 DNA polymerase/TP interaction, modeled on the crystal structure of RB69 DNA polymerase (48Wang J.

Oligonucleotides 15-mer (5′-GATCACAGTGAGTAC) and 21-mer (5′-TCTATTGTACTCACTGTGATC), which has a 5′-extension of six nucleotides in addition to the sequence complementary to the 15-mer, were supplied by Isogen. Oligonucleotide 15-mer was 5′-labeled with [γ-32P]ATP and T4 polynucleotide kinase. 5′-Labeled 15-mer was hybridized to 21-mer in the presence of 0.2 m NaCl and 60 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5. ø29 DNA was obtained by proteinase K treatment of phage particles in the presence of SDS (56Inciarte M.R.

M13mp18 ssDNA was hybridized to the universal primer as described above, and the resulting molecule was used as a primer/template to analyze processive DNA polymerization coupled to strand displacement by ø29 DNA polymerase. Terminal protein-containing ø29 DNA (ø29 TP-DNA) was obtained as described (57Peñalva M.A. Salas M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1982; 79: 5522-5526Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar). The incubation mixture contained, in 25 μl, 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5; 10 mmMgCl2; 20 mm ammonium sulfate; 1 mmdithiothreitol; 4% glycerol; 0.1 mg/ml BSA; 20 μm each dCTP, dGTP, dTTP, and [α-32P]dATP (1 μCi); 0.5 μg of ø29 TP-DNA; 125 ng of purified TP; and 5 ng of either wild-type or mutant ø29 DNA polymerase. After incubation for 10 min at 30 °C, the reaction was stopped by adding 10 mm EDTA-0.1% SDS, and the samples were filtered through Sephadex G-50 spin columns. Relative activity was calculated from the Cerenkov radiation corresponding to the excluded volume. For size analysis, the labeled DNA was denatured by treatment with 0.7 m NaOH and subjected to electrophoresis in alkaline 0.7% agarose gels, as described (58McDonnell M.W. Simon M.N. Studier F.W. J. Mol. Biol. 1977; 110: 119-146Crossref PubMed Scopus (1043) Google Scholar). After electrophoresis, the position of unit-length ø29 DNA (19,285 bases) was detected by ethidium bromide staining, and then the gels were dried and autoradiographed. For the analysis of the transition products, 100 ng of DNA polymerase were used, providing the concentration of dNTP indicated in each case. The samples were analyzed in an SDS-12% polyacrylamide gel (360 × 280 × 0.5 mm) to obtain enough resolution to distinguish the TP bound to the first elongation products. The incubation mixture contained, in 25 μl, 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5; 10 mm MgCl2; 20 mm ammonium sulfate; 1 mm dithiothreitol; 4% glycerol; 0.1 mg/ml BSA; 80 μm each dCTP, dGTP, dTTP, and [α-32P] dATP (2 μCi); 5 ng of ø29 TP-DNA; 5 ng of either wild-type or mutant ø29 DNA polymerase; 5 ng of TP; 10 μg of ø29 ssDNA binding protein; and 10 μg of ø29 dsDNA binding protein. After incubation for 90 min at 30 °C, the samples were processed, and the amplified DNA was analyzed by electrophoresis in alkaline agarose gels, as described (59Blanco L. Lázaro J.M. de Vega M. Bonnin A. Salas M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 12198-12202Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). After electrophoresis, the position of unit-length ø29 DNA was detected by ethidium bromide staining. The incubation mixture contained, in 25 μl, 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5; 10 mm MgCl2; 1 mm dithiothreitol; 4% glycerol; 0.1 mg/ml BSA; 80 μm each dCTP, dGTP, dTTP, and [α-32P]dATP (2.5 μCi); 0.25 μg of primed M13mp8 ssDNA; and 25 ng of either wild-type or mutant ø29 DNA polymerase. After incubation for the indicated times at 30 °C, the samples were processed, and the synthesized DNA was quantitated and analyzed as described above for the ø29 TP-DNA replication assay. After electrophoresis, unit-length M13mp8 ssDNA was detected by ethidium bromide staining, and then, gels were dried and autoradiographed. The incubation mixture contained, in 25 μl, 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 10 mm MgCl2, 20 mm ammonium sulfate, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 4% glycerol, 0.1 mg/ml BSA, 0.2 μm dATP ([α-32P]dATP) (2.5 μCi), 0.5 μg of ø29 TP-DNA, 125 ng of purified TP, and 5 ng of either wild-type or mutant ø29 DNA polymerase and was incubated for 4 min at 30 °C. In the case of the template-independent initiation assay, ø29 TP-DNA was omitted, 80 ng of either wild-type or mutant ø29 DNA polymerase were added, 1 mm MnCl2 was used instead of MgCl2, and the incubation was maintained for 90 min at 30 °C. The reactions were stopped by adding 10 mmEDTA and 0.1% SDS, filtered through Sephadex G-50 spin columns, and further analyzed by SDS-PAGE as described (57Peñalva M.A. Salas M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1982; 79: 5522-5526Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar). Quantitation was done by densitometric analysis of the labeled band corresponding to the TP-dAMP complex, detected by autoradiography. Reactions were carried out as described for the template-independent initiation assay, but in the absence of template and using a limiting amount of TP and different proportions of a mixture of wild-type and mutant DNA polymerases. ø29 DNA polymerase mutant D249E (catalytically inactive but displaying a normal interaction with the TP) was used as a positive control for the interference assay, as described previously (15Blasco M.A. Lázaro J.M. Blanco L. Salas M. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 24106-24113Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The amounts of proteins used were as follows: 10 ng of TP, 25 ng of wild-type DNA polymerase, and either 25, 200, or 800 ng of each mutant derivative (D249E, F65S, or S122N). In all cases, the incubation was for 2 h at 30 °C. After incubation, reactions were stopped and analyzed as indicated for the protein-primed initiation assay. The incubation mixture contained, in 150 μl, 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 0.1 mg/ml BSA, 20 mm ammonium sulfate, 1 μg of TP, and 2 μg of either wild-type or mutant DNA polymerase. After incubation for 30 min at 4 °C, samples were loaded in 15–30% glycerol gradients (4 ml) in the presence of 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 20 mm ammonium sulfate, 0.2 m NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, and 7 mm 2-mercaptoethanol and centrifuged at 4 °C for 24 h at 62,000 rpm in a Beckman SW65 rotor. Gradients were fractionated and subjected to SDS-PAGE in 12% polyacrylamide gels. After electrophoretical separation, the proteins in the gel were transferred to a polyvinylidene difluoride membrane (Millipore) during 120 min at 100 mA and incubated with polyclonal antibodies against ø29 DNA polymerase and TP. Detection was carried out using the ECL Western blotting system (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). A 5′-labeled 15-mer/21-mer hybrid molecule was used as DNA primer/template to analyze the interaction with either wild-type or mutant ø29 DNA polymerases. The incubation mixture, in a final volume of 20 μl, contained 12 mmTris-HCl, pH 7.5, 1 mm EDTA, 10 mmMgCl2, 20 mm ammonium sulfate, 0.1 mg/ml BSA, 0.18 ng of the 15-mer/21-mer molecule, and 5 ng of either wild-type or mutant ø29 DNA polymerase. To analyze the interaction of wild-type ø29 DNA polymerase/TP heterodimer with DNA primer/template and ssDNA, the heterodimer was preformed by incubating 40 ng of wild-type DNA polymerase with 20 ng of TP, in the presence of 12 mmTris-HCl, pH 7.5, and 20 mm ammonium sulfate. After incubation for 30 min at 4 °C, either the heterodimer, 40 ng of wild-type ø29 DNA polymerase, or 20 ng of TP were incubated with either 0.18 ng of the 15-mer/21-mer or with 0.075 ng of 15-mer molecule, under the conditions described above. When ssDNA was used as substrate, MgCl2 was omitted to avoid its degradation. After incubation for 5 min at 4 °C, the samples were subjected to electrophoresis in 4% (w/v) polyacrylamide gels (80:1, monomer:bis), containing 12 mm Tris acetate, pH 7.5, and 1 mmEDTA and run at 4 °C in the same buffer at 8 V/cm, essentially as described (60Carthew R.W. Chodosch L.A. Sharp P.A. Cell. 1985; 43: 439-448Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (404) Google Scholar). After autoradiography, ø29 DNA polymerase, TP, and DNA polymerase/TP complexed with ssDNA and dsDNA were detected as a mobility shift (retardation) in the migrating position of the labeled DNA. Quantitation of the binding capacity of the wild-type ø29 DNA polymerase versus its mutant derivatives was carried out by densitometry of the retarded band. The hybrid molecule 15-mer/21-mer can be used as a substrate for DNA-dependent DNA polymerization, because it contains a 6-nucleotide-long 5′-protruding end. The incubation mixture contained, in 12.5 μl, 12 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5; 10 mmMgCl2; 0.18 ng of 5′-labeled 15-mer/21-mer; 400 nm each of the four dNTPs; and either 40 ng of wild-type ø29 DNA polymerase; 20 ng of TP, or 60 ng of the DNA polymerase/TP complex (preformed as indicated above). After incubation for 2 min at 4 °C (to guarantee the stabilization of the interaction between TP and DNA polymerase), the reaction was stopped by adding EDTA up to 10 mm. Samples were analyzed by 8 m urea-20% PAGE and autoradiography. Polymerization is detected as an increase in the size (15-mer) of the 5′-labeled 15-mer primer. The incubation mixture contained, in 12.5 μl, 12 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5; 10 mm MgCl2; and either 40 ng of the wild-type ø29 DNA polymerase, 20 ng of TP, or 60 ng of the DNA polymerase/TP heterodimer (preformed as indicated above). 0.075 ng of a 5′-labeled oligonucleotide (15-mer) was used as ssDNA substrate. Samples were incubated for 2 min at 4 °C (to preserve the stabilization of the TP/DNA polymerase heterodimer) and quenched by adding 3 μl of sequencing gel loading buffer. Reactions were analyzed by 8 m urea-20% PAGE and autoradiography. Fig. 1 shows a multiple alignment of two amino acid motifs, highly conserved in all DNA-dependent DNA polymerases endowed with a proofreading activity, but restricted here to the subgroup of eukaryotic-type DNA polymerases that use a protein-priming mechanism and to RB69 DNA polymerase, the crystal structure of which has been recently solved (48Wang J.

https://openalex.org/W2066133678,"The molecular mechanism of substrate recognition in membrane transport is not well understood. Two amino acid residues, Tyr446 and Trp455 in transmembrane segment 10 (TM10), have been shown to be important for galactose recognition by the yeast Gal2 transporter; Tyr446 was found to be essential in that its replacement by any of the other 19 amino acids abolished transport activity (Kasahara, M., Shimoda, E., and Maeda, M. (1997) J. Biol. Chem. 272, 16721-16724). The Glut1 glucose transporter of animal cells belongs to the same Glut transporter family as does Gal2 and thus might be expected to show a similar mechanism of substrate recognition. The role of the two amino acids, Phe379 and Trp388, in rat Glut1 corresponding to Tyr446 and Trp455 of Gal2 was therefore studied. Phe379 and Trp388 were individually replaced with each of the other 19 amino acids, and the mutant Glut1 transporters were expressed in yeast. The expression level of most mutants was similar to that of the wild-type Glut1, as revealed by immunoblot analysis. Glucose transport activity was assessed by reconstituting a crude membrane fraction of the yeast cells in liposomes. No significant glucose transport activity was observed with any of Trp388 mutants, whereas the Phe379 mutants showed reduced or no activity. These results indicate that the two aromatic amino acids in TM10 of Glut1 are important for glucose transport. However, unlike Gal2, the residue at the cytoplasmic end of TM10 (Trp388, corresponding to Trp455 of Gal2), rather than that in the middle of TM10 (Phe379, corresponding to Tyr446 of Gal2), is essential for transport activity."
https://openalex.org/W2080523215,"Histone deacetylase-2 (HDAC2) is a component of a complex that mediates transcriptional repression in mammalian cells. A mouse HDAC2 cDNA was used to identify several recombinant clones containing the entire mouse HDAC2 gene. The mouse HDAC2 gene spans over 36 kilobase pairs and is composed of 14 exons (ranging from 58 to 362 nucleotides in length) and 13 introns (ranging from 75 base pairs to 19 kilobase pairs in length). Primer extension analysis with total RNA from NIH3T3 cells revealed a major transcriptional start site at 221 base pairs 5' of the ATG translational start codon. Upstream of the transcriptional start site, no canonical TATA box was found, but binding sites for several known transcription factors were identified. Transient transfection studies with 5' deletion mutants localized the promoter to no more than 76 base pairs upstream from the major transcriptional start site. Fluorescence in situ hybridization mapped mouse HDAC2 to chromosomal location 10B1, which is in close proximity to the growth factor-inducible gene fisp-12. Information concerning the genomic organization and promoter of HDAC2 will be useful in studies of the regulation of histone deacetylase activities, which in turn are important in studies of the regulation of transcriptional repression in mammalian cells."
https://openalex.org/W2087795674,"The comprehensive study of chimeras between the Gal2 galactose transporter and the Hxt2 glucose transporter of Saccharomyces cerevisiae has shown that Tyr446is essential and Trp455 is important for galactose recognition by Gal2. Consistent with this finding, replacement of the corresponding Phe431 and Tyr440 residues of Hxt2 with Tyr and Trp, respectively, allowed Hxt2 to transport galactose, suggesting that the two amino acid residues in putative transmembrane segment 10 play a definite role in galactose recognition (Kasahara, M., Shimoda, E., and Maeda, M. (1997) J. Biol. Chem. 272, 16721–16724). Replacement of Trp455 of Gal2 with any of the other 19 amino acids was shown to reduce galactose transport activity to between 0 and <20% of that of wild-type Gal2. The role of Phe431 in Hxt2 was similarly studied. Other than Phe, only Tyr at position 431 was able to support glucose transport activity, at the reduced level of <20%. In contrast, replacement of Tyr440 of Hxt2 with other amino acids revealed that most replacements, with the exception of Pro and charged amino acids, supported glucose transport activity. The importance of residue 431 in sugar recognition was more pronounced in a modified Hxt2 in which Tyr440 was replaced with Trp. Glucose transport was supported only by the aromatic amino acids Phe, Tyr, and Trp at position 431, and galactose transport was supported only by Tyr. These results suggest that an aromatic amino acid located in the middle of transmembrane segment 10 (Tyr446 in Gal2 and Phe431 in Hxt2) plays a critical role in substrate recognition in the yeast sugar transporter family to which Gal2 and Hxt2 belong.

The yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae possesses nearly 20 homologous genes that potentially encode proteins belonging to the sugar transporter family (1Baldwin S.A. Biochim. Biophys.

This family includes both Hxt2, a major high affinity glucose transporter and Gal2, a major high affinity galactose transporter that also transports glucose with almost the same affinity (2Bisson L.F. Coons D.M. Kruckeberg A.L. Lewis D.A Crit. Rev. Biochem. Mol. Biol. 1993; 28: 259-308Crossref PubMed Scopus (211) Google Scholar, 5Nishizawa K. Shimoda E. Kasahara M. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 2423-2426Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). We have previously taken a three-step comprehensive approach to identify the amino acid residues responsible for substrate recognition in Gal2 and Hxt2 (5Nishizawa K. Shimoda E. Kasahara M. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 2423-2426Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar, 6Kasahara M. Shimoda E. Maeda M.

Chem. 1997; 272: 16721-16724Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). In the first step (5Nishizawa K. Shimoda E. Kasahara M. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 2423-2426Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar), three types of systematic chimeras between Gal2 and Hxt2 were constructed with the use of the Escherichia coli homologous recombination system. The site responsible for differential recognition of galactose and glucose was localized to a COOH-terminal region of 101 amino acids. In the second step (6Kasahara M. Shimoda E. Maeda M. FEBS Lett. 1996; 389: 174-178Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar), the 101-amino acid region was subdivided into transmembrane (TM)1 segment 10, TM11, TM12, and the proximal half of the COOH-terminal hydrophilic tail by introducing five restriction enzyme sites into the corresponding segment of each gene, without changing the encoded amino acids. By analyzing the 16 clones encoding all possible combinations of subdomains, we identified TM10 as the segment responsible for differential recognition of galactose and glucose. In the third step (7Kasahara M. Shimoda E. Maeda M. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 16721-16724Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar), a mixture of ∼25,000 distinct plasmids that encoded all possible combinations of the 12 amino acids in TM10 that differ between Gal2 and Hxt2 was produced. All the 19 galactose transport-positive clones selected on galactose-limited agar plates encoded transporters containing the Tyr446 residue of Gal2 (see Fig. 8). Fourteen of the 19 clones also encoded Trp455 of Gal2 and the other five encoded Cys455, a residue not found in either Gal2 or Hxt2. To confirm that Tyr446 is important for substrate recognition, we replaced this residue of Gal2 with each of the other 19 amino acids. None of the resulting transporters exhibited galactose transport activity. Replacement of Phe431 and Tyr440 of Hxt2 with the corresponding Tyr and Trp of Gal2 allowed the modified Hxt2 to transport galactose. These results demonstrated that Tyr446is essential and Trp455 is important for the discrimination of galactose and glucose by Gal2. The present study was designed to answer the following questions: (i) Is the apparently essential role of Tyr446 in substrate recognition by Gal2 attributable to a contribution to the affinity of the transporter for galactose? (ii) Which amino acid residues can substitute for Trp455 of Gal2? (iii) Is Phe431of Hxt2 essential for glucose recognition? (iv) Is Tyr440of Hxt2 important for glucose recognition? We obtained the results indicating that Tyr446 is exclusively required for galactose recognition and two aromatic amino acids in TM10 play important roles in substrate recognition both in Gal2 and Hxt2. The cassette vector GAL2-pTV3e was constructed as described previously (5Nishizawa K. Shimoda E. Kasahara M. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 2423-2426Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). Briefly,GAL2 (8Nehlin J.O. Carlberg M. Ronne H. Gene (Amst.). 1989; 85: 313-319Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar) was introduced into the YEp-based vector pTV3 (YEpTRP1 bla) (9Rose M.D. Broach J.R. Methods Enzymol. 1991; 194: 195-230Crossref PubMed Scopus (214) Google Scholar). After the disruption of an EcoRI site situated at the boundary of GAL2 and the vector by blunting, a new EcoRI site was introduced immediately downstream of the initiation codon by PCR (10Pont-Kington G. BioTechniques. 1994; 16: 1010-1011PubMed Google Scholar), which resulted in a change in the encoded amino acid sequence from Met-Ala-Val-Glu to Met-Ala-Glu-Phe. A new ClaI site was also introduced immediately downstream of the termination codon of GAL2. Since HXT2 contains a single EcoRI site at the position corresponding to that of the newly created site in GAL2, it was necessary to introduce only a newClaI site at the position corresponding to that in GAL2. These two sites were used to replace the open reading frame of GAL2 in GAL2-pTV3e with that of HXT2, yielding HXT2-pTV3e. Both GAL2-pTV3e and HXT2-pTV3e were further modified to create five restriction enzyme sites (SacI,MluI, SpeI, StuI, and NcoI) in the distal half of each gene (6Kasahara M. Shimoda E. Maeda M. FEBS Lett. 1996; 389: 174-178Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar), yielding GAL2d-pTV3e and HXT2d-pTV3e, respectively (the StuI site in GAL2 and the NcoI site in HXT2 are preexisting sites). Residues Tyr446 and Trp455 of Gal2 and the corresponding Phe431 and Tyr440 of Hxt2 were targeted for by each of the other 19 amino acids. The nucleotide sequence of Gal2 coding for Trp455 was randomly modified by PCR with a degenerate primer. A forward primer 5′-CACGG TAAAA GCCAG CCGAG CTCTA AAGGT GCCGG TA encompassing the SacI site and a degenerate reverse primer 5′-TTCGA CTTGA CGCGT AGTGG GAATG ATTCT GCTGT GATGA CNNNG GCA AC TGGGG CCCAG GT that creates a new ApaI site at a position corresponding to that in HXT2 were used for long PCR (Ex Taq, Takara). Twenty-five cycles of 95 °C for 30 s, 50 °C for 2 min and 72 °C for 1 min were performed with a thermocycler (model 2400, Perkin-Elmer). The PCR products were digested with SacI and MluI and introduced into the corresponding position of GAL2d-pTV3e. A total of 40 clones was sequenced, and 14 encoding the desired amino acids were selected (Table I). The remaining five clones were generated with the use of a specific primer for each amino acid. This series of clones was designated Gal2(Y-X). Replacement of Tyr446 with each of the other 19 amino acids was performed in a similar manner, with this series of clones designated Gal2(X-W). For the Hxt2 transporter, four series of clones, designated Hxt2(X-Y), Hxt2(F-X), Hxt2(X-W), and Hxt2(Y-X) according to the same nomenclature were produced.Table ICodon usage for mutation of GAL2 and HXT2Gal2(X-W)Gal2(Y-X)Hxt2(X-Y)Hxt2(F-X)Hxt2(X-W)Hxt2(Y-X)X446CodonW455Y446X455CodonX431CodonY440F431X440CodonX431CodonW440Y431X440CodonGGGGGGGCGGGAGGGGGGGAGGGGAGCUAGCCAGCGAGCUAGCGAGCUVGUGVGUCVGUGUAUVGUUVGUGVGUULCUULUUGLUUGLCUALUUGLUUAIAUAIAUAIAUAIAUUIAUAIAUUFUUUFUUUFUUCUACUUUFUUUFUUUFUUUWUGGWUGGWUGGWUGGWUGGWUGGMAUGMAUGMAUGMAUGMAUGMAUGCUGUCUGUCUGUCUGUCUGUCUGUPCCUUGGUAUPCCCPCCAPCCUPCCUUGGUAUPCCUSAGUSUCCSAGUSUCUSUCGSUCUTACUTACUTACUTACGTACUTACUYUAUYUACYUAUUAUUUCYUACYUAUYUAUNAACNAAUNAAUNAAUNAAUNAAUQCAAQCAAQCAAQCAGQCAAQCAGDGAUDGAUDGAUUUUDGAUDGAUDGAUEGAAEGAAEGAAEGAAEGAAEGAAHCAUHCAUHCAUHCAUHCAUHCAUKAAAKAAAKAAAKAAAKAAAKAAARCGURAGARCGARAGARCGARAGAThe nucleotide sequences of GAL2 and HXT2 were modified to encode Gal2(X-W), Gal2(Y-X), Hxt2(X-Y), Hxt2(F-X), Hxt2(X-W), and Hxt2(Y-X) transporters as described under “Experimental Procedures.” The original codons are UAU(Y446) in GAL2 and UUC(F431) and UAC(Y440) in HXT2.

The nucleotide sequences of the substituted fragments and the surrounding regions in each clone were verified by sequencing both strands with a DNA sequencer (model 373A, Perkin-Elmer). Yeast cells were cultured as described (5Nishizawa K. Shimoda E. Kasahara M. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 2423-2426Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar, 6Kasahara M.

Transport of galactose or glucose in yeast strain LBY416(MATα hxt2::LEU2 snf3::HIS3 gal2 lys2 ade2 trp1 his3 leu2 ura3) harboring the various Gal2 or Hxt2 plasmids was measured at 30 °C for 5 s (7Kasahara M. Shimoda E. Maeda M. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 16721-16724Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). Transport activities with 0.1 mmgalactose or glucose were expressed as picomoles/107cells/5 s. For comparison, the background obtained with control cells harboring the empty vector was subtracted from transport activity obtained with each clone, and the activity was normalized by expression as a percentage of that obtained with cells expressing Gal2 (galactose transport) or Hxt2 (glucose transport). Although in some instances, values of <10% were significant by Student's t test (p < 0.05), we considered only values of >10% as significant, since cell numbers determined with Burker-Turk cell counters were somewhat variable, and some transporters showed activities that were less than the control values, sometimes as low as −5 to −10%. Immunoblot analysis of cell homogenates was performed as described previously (5Nishizawa K. Shimoda E. Kasahara M. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 2423-2426Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). Briefly, polyclonal rabbit antibody to Gal2 or Hxt2 was produced by using the COOH-terminal 13 or 14 oligopeptide, respectively, that was coupled to keyhole limpet hemocyanin. Yeast cells grown to an early log phase were washed with H2O and disrupted with glass beads. The homogenate was subjected to SDS-gel electrophoresis and blotted onto a polyvinylidine difluoride membrane (Immobilon PSQ, Millipore), followed by incubation with125I-protein A (IM144, Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) overnight. Autoradiography was performed with imaging plates (BAS2000, Fuji Film). Under the present conditions, a linear relation of amounts of protein and radioactivity was observed. These antibodies reacted with Gal2 or Hxt2, but not with other homologous proteins revealed by the yeast genome sequence (5Nishizawa K. Shimoda E. Kasahara M. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 2423-2426Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar, 6Kasahara M. Shimoda E. Maeda M. FEBS Lett. 1996; 389: 174-178Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). To evaluate the possible degradation of modified Hxt2 transporters in vivo and in vitro, we used the protease-deficient strain BJ3505 (MAT a pep4::HIS3 prb1-Δ1.6R his3 lys2 trp1 ura3 gal2 can1) in place of LBY416 or added a mixture of protease inhibitors consisting of 5 mm EDTA, pepstatin A (2 μg/ml), leupeptin (2 μg/ml), aprotinin (100 units/ml), and 2 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride (final concentrations) to the homogenization solution. Neither approach appeared to affect the amounts of these transporters. Our previous studies with systematic series of chimeras of Gal2 and Hxt2 revealed that Tyr446 in Gal2 is essential for the differential recognition of galactose and glucose (5Nishizawa K. Shimoda E. Kasahara M. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 2423-2426Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar, 6Kasahara M. Shimoda E. Maeda M.

Chem. 1997; 272: 16721-16724Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). To characterize further the role of Tyr446 in substrate recognition, we measured transport of galactose or glucose by Gal2(X-W) transporters at a substrate concentration (10 mm) 100 times that used previously (Fig. 1). Even at this high substrate concentration, substantial galactose transport was mediated only by Gal2(Y-W); Gal2(F-W) showed 12% of the galactose transport activity of Gal2, whereas the other Gal2(X-W) transporters showed no significant activity (Fig. 1 A). Glucose transport at the high substrate concentration was mediated by many of the Gal2(X-W) transporters (Fig. 1 B). Gal2(Y-W) and Gal2(F-W) were most active, with Gly, Ala, Val, Leu, Met, Cys, Ser, Thr, and Asn substitutions also conferring transport activity at the high glucose concentration. Comparison of glucose transport activities between substrate concentrations of 0.1 and 10 mm indicates that the transporters with glucose transport activities of ∼20% at 10 mm glucose possess K m values of ∼100 mm. The differences in transport activity were not due to differences in the extent of expression of Gal2(X-W) transporters, as revealed by immunoblot analysis of cell homogenates (Fig. 2 A).Figure 2Expression of Gal2(X-W) and Gal2(Y-X) transporters as detected by immunoblot analysis. LBY416 cells harboring plasmids containing GAL2, each of 20 Gal2(X-W) genes (A), or each of 20 Gal2(Y-X) genes (B) were cultured to early log phase and homogenized.

The replacement of Trp455 with any of the other 19 amino acids markedly reduced galactose transport to <20% of that of Gal2, although significant activity was exhibited by transporters containing Tyr, Cys, Thr, Ile, or Met at this position (Fig. 3). In glucose transport assays, Gal2(Y-W), or wild-type Gal2, showed only 28% of the activity of Hxt2; this may be mainly due to Tyr446 since replacement of this residue with Phe increased the glucose transport activity to 60% of that of Hxt2 (Fig. 1 B). Gal2(Y-X) transporters containing Tyr, Phe, or Thr showed almost the same glucose transport activity as did the original Gal2. Thus, for galactose transport, Trp was the most favorable amino acid at position 455, with other amino acids conferring little activity; whereas for glucose transport, replacement of Trp with many other amino acids supported activity, although not to the same extent as did Trp. The expression levels were similar for each of the Gal2(Y-X) transporters (Fig. 2 B). Our previous study (7Kasahara M. Shimoda E. Maeda M. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 16721-16724Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar) and the results described above indicate that Tyr446 in Gal2 is essential for the recognition of galactose. Since Gal2 and Hxt2 share an amino acid sequence identity of ∼70% (5Nishizawa K. Shimoda E. Kasahara M. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 2423-2426Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar), it is reasonable to hypothesize that Phe431 of Hxt2, corresponding to Tyr446 of Gal2, may be important for recognition of glucose. Transport of glucose or galactose in cells expressing Hxt2(X-Y) transporters was measured at a substrate concentration of 0.1 mm (Fig. 4 A). The only transporter other than Hxt2(F-Y), or wild-type Hxt2, that exhibited significant glucose transport activity was Hxt2(Y-Y), which showed an activity of 17% of that of Hxt2. In contrast, none of the Hxt2(X-Y) transporters supported galactose transport. Some of the Hxt2(X-Y) transporters were expressed at a low level, as revealed by immunoblot analysis (Fig. 5 A). Transporters containing Pro or charged amino acids at position 431 tended to show a reduced level of expression, suggesting that a proper conformation of the protein is necessary for it to maintain its integrity, although the possibility of protein degradation during preparation can not be excluded at present (see “Experimental Procedures” and “Discussion”).Figure 5Expression of Hxt2(X-Y) and Hxt2(F-X) transporters as detected by immunoblot analysis. Cells harboring plasmids containing HXT2, each of 20 Hxt2(X-Y) genes (A) or each of 20 Hxt2(F-X) genes (B) were cultured to early log phase and homogenized. A portion of 10 μg was subjected to immunoblot analysis with antibodies to the COOH terminus of Hxt2 (5Nishizawa K. Shimoda E. Kasahara M. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 2423-2426Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). The bands immediately below the 47,000 (47k) recombinant proteins appear to be degradation products; their abundance increased by repeated freeze-thaw treatment of homogenates.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) To study the role of Tyr440 of Hxt2, we measured glucose transport in cells expressing Hxt2(F-X) transporters (Fig. 4 B). In contrast to Hxt2(X-Y) transporters, many Hxt2(F-X) transporters showed high glucose transport activities. However, no significant glucose transport activity was apparent with transporters containing Pro or the charged amino acids Asp, Glu, His, Lys, or Arg at position 440. None of the Hxt2(F-X) transporters exhibited galactose transport activity. Since the expression of transporters containing these charged amino acids was markedly reduced (Fig. 5 B), the results obtained with the corresponding cells were inconclusive. In the previous study (7Kasahara M. Shimoda E. Maeda M. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 16721-16724Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar), to confirm that Tyr446 and Trp455 of Gal2 are important for galactose recognition, we replaced the corresponding amino acids of Hxt2, Phe431, and Tyr440, with Tyr and Trp, respectively. The resulting Hxt2(Y-W) transporter mediated galactose transport in addition to glucose transport. In the present study, we constructed the Hxt2(X-W) series of transporters to determine whether amino acids other than Tyr at position of 431 of Hxt2 can support galactose transport. Hxt2(Y-W) was the only transporter in the Hxt2(X-W) series that exhibited galactose transport activity (Fig. 6 A). This apparently essential role for Tyr431 in galactose transport by doubly modified Hxt2 suggests that, in wild-type Hxt2, Phe431 together with Tyr440 acts to admit glucose and reject galactose. Hxt2(Y-W) showed a K m for galactose of 43 mm, which is about eight times that of Gal2 and almost identical to that of Hxt2–8, which possesses a Gal2-derived TM10 (6Kasahara M. Shimoda E. Maeda M. FEBS Lett. 1996; 389: 174-178Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). For glucose transport, the importance of aromatic amino acids at position 431 was apparent, with only Hxt2(X-W) transporters containing Phe, Tyr, or Trp exhibiting glucose transport activity. Hxt2(Y-X) transporters behaved differently (Fig. 6 B). For galactose transport, Trp, Met, Cys, Thr, and Leu were effective, but the aromatic amino acids Phe and Tyr were not. Thus, the combination of Tyr431 and Trp440 present in Gal2 was also most effective in conferring galactose transport activity on the background of Hxt2. Glucose transport in cells expressing Hxt2(Y-X) transporters was at most ∼25% of that in cells expressing Hxt2, a value similar to that obtained with cells expressing Gal2. Glucose transport at this reduced level was observed with Hxt2(Y-X) transporters containing a wide range of amino acids, including Trp, Phe, Tyr, Cys, Thr, Met, Leu, and Ile. Taken together, our data indicate that the combination of Phe431 and Tyr440 is most accepting of glucose and rejects galactose efficiently. The extent of expression of Hxt2(Y-I) and Hxt2(Y-D) was low, indicating that no definitive conclusions can be drawn for these mutants (Fig. 7 B). In this study, we have demonstrated the importance of two aromatic amino acid residues in putative TM10 for substrate recognition by Gal2 and Hxt2. Hereafter, the aromatic amino acid situated in the middle of TM10, Tyr446 in Gal2 and Phe431 in Hxt2, is referred to as the middle aromatic site (Fig. 8), and that situated at the cytoplasmic end of TM10, Trp455 in Gal2 and Tyr440 in Hxt2, is referred to as the cytoplasmic aromatic site. We previously showed (7Kasahara M. Shimoda E. Maeda M. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 16721-16724Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar) that Tyr446 of Gal2 is essential for the differential recognition of galactose and glucose on the basis that none of 19 other amino acids was able to replace it for galactose transport. However, it remained possible that the apparent inability of other amino acids to support galactose transport may have been overcome by higher concentrations of substrate. In the present study, to determine whether the role of the middle aromatic site is merely to contribute to the affinity for galactose, we compared galactose transport at substrate concentrations of 0.1 and 10 mm. Our observation that, even at the high galactose concentration, substantial galactose transport was mediated only by Gal2(Y-W), with Gal2(F-W) showing a small amount of activity, is consistent with the idea that Tyr at the middle aromatic site is not merely a contributor to the affinity for galactose, but rather is exclusively required for the selection of galactose. In contrast, for glucose transport, Tyr at the middle aromatic site of Gal2 was not essential. The observation that other amino acid residues were able to replace it, especially at the high substrate concentration, indicates that the role of this Tyr residue in glucose transport is to increase the affinity for glucose. Glucose transport in cells expressing Hxt2(X-Y) transporters was supported by Phe and, to a much lesser extent, by Tyr. A similar tendency was apparent with Hxt2(X-W) transporters, in which the requirement for an aromatic amino acid showed an order of preference of Phe ≫ Tyr > Trp, as well as with Gal2(X-W) transporters, which showed the same rank order of preference at the low glucose concentration. These observations suggest that the glucose recognition process is similar in both transporters. The apparently different roles of the middle aromatic site in galactose and glucose transport might be indicative of multiple functions of the amino acid at this site (see below). With regard to the cytoplasmic aromatic site, galactose transport by Gal2(Y-X) transporters was preferentially supported by Trp, with several other amino acids, including Tyr > Cys ≈ Met ≈ Thr ≈ Ile, also conferring activity. Glucose transport by Hxt2(F-X) transporters was supported by most amino acids, excluding Pro and charged residues. Similar patterns of glucose transport activities were observed with Hxt2(Y-X) and Gal2(Y-X) transporters, although Tyr at the middle aromatic site appeared to reduce the activities of these series. These results indicated that the interaction of the cytoplasmic site with glucose may be similar in Gal2 and Hxt2. It should be mentioned that the variable level of expression of Hxt2(F-X) and Hxt2(Y-X) transporters revealed by immunoblot analysis may not necessarily reflect the amounts of the transporters in intact cells, since the expression level of Gal2(Y-X) transporters was not variable and yet they showed a pattern of glucose transport activity similar to those of the Hxt2(F-X) and Hxt2(Y-X) transporters. A total of 18 closely related sugar transporters has been identified in S. cerevisiae, the cluster I of sugar permease homologs (4Nelissen B. De Wachter R. Goffeau A. FEMS Microbiol. Rev. 1997; 21: 113-134Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) that is equivalent to the hexose transporter family (3Kruckeberg A.L. Arch. Microbiol. 1996; 166: 283-292Crossref PubMed Scopus (205) Google Scholar), excluding Snf3 and Rgt2, which appear to be glucose sensor (11Ozcan S. Dover J. Rosenwald A.G. Wolfl S. Johnston M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 12428-12432Crossref PubMed Scopus (347) Google Scholar). Of these 18 homologs, only Gal2 contains Tyr at the middle aromatic site and Trp at the cytoplasmic site. All the other 17 homologs, including Hxt2, contain Phe at the middle site. At the cytoplasmic site, Tyr is present in most homologs and Phe in Hxt4, Hxt12, and Hxt14. Together with our demonstration that Phe was the second most active residue in Hxt2(F-X) transporters in terms of glucose transport, these observations are consistent with the idea that Gal2 is the only galactose transporter and that the other 17 transporters are glucose transporters. If this is the case, low affinity galactose transport noted in previous studies (2Bisson L.F. Coons D.M. Kruckeberg A.L. Lewis D.A Crit. Rev. Biochem. Mol. Biol. 1993; 28: 259-308Crossref PubMed Scopus (211) Google Scholar) may be attributable to one or more of the glucose transporters carrying galactose with low affinity. This notion is also consistent with the selection of galactose transport-positive clones fromgal2 mutants (7Kasahara M. Shimoda E. Maeda M. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 16721-16724Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar) and the selection of glucose transport-positive clones from strains carrying gal2 and multiple hxt mutations in the presence of antimycin (12Liang H. Ko C.H. Herman T. Gaber R.F. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 926-935Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). Several functions for the two aromatic sites in galactose transport by Gal2 have been proposed (7Kasahara M. Shimoda E. Maeda M. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 16721-16724Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar), including roles in steric hindrance, hydrogen bonding, a stacking effect with the sugar, and structural changes in other amino acids that interact directly with the sugar. In addition, the possibility that the two amino acids function independently has also been suggested. Recent structural studies on porins (13Dutzler R. Wang Y.F. Rizkallah P. Rosenbusch J.P. Schirmer T. Structure. 1996; 4: 127-134Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar, 14Forst D. Welte W. Wacker T. Diederichs K. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1998; 5: 37-46Crossref PubMed Scopus (209) Google Scholar) may be worth mentioning in this respect. The three-dimensional structures of maltoporin and the sucrose-specific porin SrcY analyzed by x-ray crystallography indicate that maltose and sucrose passes through the corresponding porins via a relay of aromatic amino acids. Since most galactose and glucose molecules are in the form of β- and α-pyranose in aqueous solution (15Vyas M.N. Vyas N.K. Quiocho F.A. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 4762-4768Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar), differential recognition of galactose and glucose requires differentiation between α- and β-anomers and C4 epimers. Crystallographic studies of binding proteins in the periplasm of bacteria (16Quiocho F.A. Biochem. Soc. Trans. 1993; 21: 442-448Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar) and of lectins (17Weiss W.I. Drickamer K. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1996; 65: 441-448Crossref PubMed Scopus (1017) Google Scholar), in addition to the porin studies, have shown that the binding of sugars to these proteins is mediated by hydrogen bonding to various amino acids and H2O and stacking of the sugars with aromatic amino acids. Thus, further insight into the molecular mechanism of substrate recognition by Gal2 and Hxt2 should be provided by identification of the amino acid residues that presumably form hydrogen bonds with galactose and glucose located at the middle site. In addition, it will be important to determine whether other aromatic amino acids in these transporters contribute to substrate binding. We thank L.

RecA protein is a recombinase from Escherichia colithat plays an important role in chromosomal rearrangements and DNA repair. RecA exerts its biological activity by formation of a nucleoprotein structure known as a presynaptic filament, which is highly conserved throughout evolution (1West S. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1992; 61: 603-640Crossref PubMed Scopus (302) Google Scholar, 2Egelman E.H. Stasiak A. Micron. 1993; 24: 309-324Crossref Scopus (66) Google Scholar, 3Kowalczykowski S.C. Eggleston A.K. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1994; 63: 991-1043Crossref PubMed Scopus (281) Google Scholar, 4Roca I.A. Cox M.M. Prog. Nucleic Acids Res. Mol. Biol. 1997; 56: 129-223Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In this structure RecA protein binds to 3–4 nucleotides per RecA monomer and polymerizes with a helical disposition on ssDNA.1 Several biochemical activities of the presynaptic filament have been characterized in vitro including ATP hydrolysis and DNA strand exchange, the central enzymatic activity of homologous recombination. Hydrolysis of ATP is associated with an ATP-dependent affinity cycle in which RecA-ATP binds most tightly to DNA and RecA-ADP binds the least tightly, whereas RecA with no cofactor has intermediate stability (5Kowalczykowski S.C. Annu. Rev. Biochem. Biophys. Chem. 1991; 20: 539-575Crossref PubMed Scopus (232) Google Scholar). The tightly bound RecA-ATP complex stretches DNA 1.5 times the length of B form duplex DNA. In this conformation the presynaptic filament can invade double stranded DNA and catalyze DNA strand exchange in vitro. It has been proposed for some time that RecA protein has two DNA-binding sites (6Howard-Flanders P. West S.C. Stasiak A. Nature. 1984; 309: 215-220Crossref PubMed Scopus (284) Google Scholar). Subsequent experiments have shown that within the nucleoprotein filament, the RecA protein monomer binds two ssDNA molecules, each with a similar binding site size (4Roca I.A. Cox M.M. Prog. Nucleic Acids Res. Mol. Biol. 1997; 56: 129-223Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 7Zlotnick A. Mitchell R.S. Steed R.K. Brenner S.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 22525-22530Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), and these sites have been functionally defined. Occupation of the first site (site I) by ssDNA is sufficient for ATP hydrolysis (7Zlotnick A. Mitchell R.S. Steed R.K. Brenner S.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 22525-22530Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and stimulation of autocleavage of LexA repressor protein (8Takahashi M. Schnarr M. Eur. J. Biochem. 1989; 183: 617-622Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar) by the nucleoprotein complex in vitro. Once assembled in a presynaptic filament, RecA is able to bind a second molecule of DNA (site II). dsDNA and ssDNA competitively bind at this site. Fixation of a second ssDNA molecule at site II does not further stimulate LexA cleavage (8Takahashi M. Schnarr M. Eur. J. Biochem. 1989; 183: 617-622Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar) or ATP hydrolysis (7Zlotnick A. Mitchell R.S. Steed R.K. Brenner S.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 22525-22530Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Binding ssDNA at site II does not require Watson-Crick base pair formation with ssDNA in the primary site and may play a role in the strand exchange reaction (9Rao B.J. Radding C.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 6161-6165Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar, 10Mazin A.V. Kowalzykowski S.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 10673-10678Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). It is important to determine whether functionally defined sites I and II correspond to particular peptide sequences of the RecA protein. On the basis of the crystal structure of RecA protein in the absence of DNA, it has been proposed that the L2 loop of RecA protein (195IRMKIGVMFGNPETT209) is a DNA-binding site (11Story R.M. Weber I.T. Steitz T.A. Nature. 1992; 355: 318-325Crossref PubMed Scopus (680) Google Scholar). This sequence contains positively charged and aromatic residues that are typical constituents of DNA-binding sites. In addition it has a negatively charged residue Glu207 that is highly conserved in bacterial recombinases (4Roca I.A. Cox M.M. Prog. Nucleic Acids Res. Mol. Biol. 1997; 56: 129-223Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Various studies have attributed the L2 loop to the primary (11Story R.M. Weber I.T. Steitz T.A. Nature. 1992; 355: 318-325Crossref PubMed Scopus (680) Google Scholar, 12Malkov V.A. Camerini-Otero R.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 30230-30233Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar) or secondary (13Wang Y. Adzyma K. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 3563-3571Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar) DNA-binding site. A third possibility is that functional sites I and II do not correspond to distinct peptide sequences but require overlapping or identical surfaces of the RecA protein. To address this question, we have investigated two mutant RecA proteins, RecAE207Q (14Larminat F. Cazaux C. Germanier M. Defais M. J. Bacteriol. 1992; 174: 6264-6269Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and RecAE207K (this work), that eliminate the negative charge at position 207 and replace it with an uncharged or positively charge residue, respectively. We have compared the capacities of these proteins for DNA repair, SOS induction, and homologous recombination in vivo as well as the DNA strand exchange and DNA-dependent ATPase activities of purified proteins in vitro. Finally we have used fluorescence spectroscopy to compare the stoichiometry, structure, and stability of nucleoprotein filaments formed by mutant and wild type proteins.

Upon restriction enzyme digestion a BamHI fragment containing only therecA sequence was obtained and cloned into pBR322 DNA to create pCCrecA. Mutant recA E207K was constructed by using a 5′ polymerase chain reaction primer (CTCTACCGGTTCGCTTTCACTGGATA) harboring the AgeI site situated about 500 base pairs upstream the L2 site and a 3′ primer (TACCACCGGTAGTGGTTTTCGGATTACCGAA) matching the L2 loop up to a secondAgeI site downstream. The DNA template used was the pCC605 plasmid carrying the recA G204V mutant (20Cazaux C. Defais M. J. Mol. Biol. 1992; 223: 823-829Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar). The 3′ oligonucleotide not only brings the E207K mutation but also eliminates the HpaI site related to the G204V substitution through the reversion of this mutation toward the wild type 204 residue. This strategy allowed us to easily screen recombinant clones by restriction analysis. Upon AgeI digestion, the amplified DNA fragment was cloned into the large fragment of AgeI-digested pCCrecA to give pCCE207K recombinant plasmid.recA E207Q (14Larminat F. Cazaux C. Germanier M.

Genet. 1985; 201: 1162-1165Crossref Scopus (12) Google Scholar) freshly transformed by the plasmids pCCrecA and pCCE207K, respectively, and proteins were purified as above. Protein concentrations (moles protein) were determined using ε280 = 2.17 × 104m−1 cm−1. The purity of the final material was estimated by gel electrophoresis to be greater than 95%. Strand exchange promoted by wild type and mutant proteins was followed as described (22Cazaux C. Larminat F. Villani G. Johnson N.P. Schnarr M. Defais M. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 8246-8254Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). 9 μm M13 ssDNA, 0.8 μm E. colisingle stranded binding protein, 5 μm protein, and 1 mm ATPγS were incubated at 37 °C in 25 mmTris-HCl, 4 mm MgCH3CO2, 1 mm dithiothreitol, pH 7.5. The reaction was initiated by addition of 9 μm M13 dsDNA. In some experiments ATPγS was replaced by an ATP regenerating system consisting of 5 units/ml pyruvate kinase and 2 mm phosphoenolpyruvate. The reaction was stopped by the addition of 1% SDS, 50 mm EDTA. Deproteinized DNA was subsequently analyzed by 0.8% agarose gel electrophoresis in 40 mm Tris acetate, pH 8, 2 mm EDTA at 4 °C. Gels were stained with ethidium bromide, photographed, and quantified with the Image QuantR4.2A software from Molecular Dynamics. Results are reported as the percentage of recombination, the concentration of dsDNA products (joint molecules plus nicked circular DNA) relative to total dsDNA. ATP hydrolysis in the presence of poly(dT) was carried out in a reaction mixture containing 1 mm ATP, buffer A (10 mm HEPES, 12 mm MgCl2, 1 mm dithiothreitol, pH 7.5) and an ATP regenerating system identical to that used in the DNA strand exchange assay. The reaction was initiated by addition of RecA or mutant protein, and hydrolysis was measured by a spectrophotometric assay where 5 units/ml lactate dehydrogenase and 0.5 mm NADH were coupled to the ATP regenerating system. Decreases in NADH absorbance as a function of time were monitored at 370 nm at a constant temperature of 37 ± 0.3 °C. Initial rates, μm ADP/min, were calculated from the linear part of the curve using an extinction coefficient of ε370 = 2640 m−1 cm−1(23Morrical S.W. Lee J. Cox M.M. Biochemistry. 1986; 25: 1482-1494Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar). Fluorescence experiments were carried out using a model MOS-400 spectrophotometer from Bio-Logic (Claix, France). Samples were excited at 305 nm, and fluorescence was detected through a 345 nm cutoff filter. Data acquisition was performed with Bio-Kine software using a chart recorder mode with a 1-s sampling time. Data were corrected for dilution and inner filter effects (24Lakowicz J.R. Principles of Fluorescence Spectroscopy. Plenum Press, London1983: 44Google Scholar) using ε305 = 217 m−1 cm−1for RecA proteins, ε305 = 15 m−1cm−1 for εDNA and ε305 = 15m−1 cm−1 for nucleotide cofactors. All titrations were carried out in 600 μl of TMD buffer (10 mm Tris, 2 mm MgCl2, 0.05 mm dithiothreitol, pH 7.4). Fluorescence of εDNA alone and scattering of proteins increased linearly over all concentration ranges studied. Samples were stirred continuously at 25 ± 1 °C in a 1.0 × 0.4-cm thermostated cuvette with the 4-mm path oriented in the direction of the exciting light to minimize inner filter corrections. Protein-DNA complexes formed during titration were subsequently dissociated by aliquots of a 2 m NaCl solution in TMD buffer, pH 7.4. To investigate the effect of charge at position 207 of the RecA protein on overall DNA repair, we measured the colony forming ability after UV irradiation of ΔrecAbacteria transformed by vectors carrying wild type and mutantrecA genes (Fig. 1). Transformation of ΔrecA bacteria by a vector carryingwtrecA restored survival to the level of wild type bacteria; RecAE207K increased survival less efficiently than wt protein but more efficiently than RecAE207Q (14Larminat F. Cazaux C. Germanier M. Defais M. J. Bacteriol. 1992; 174: 6264-6269Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). RecA protein can modulate DNA repair by participating in the SOS response, which induces the expression of an ensemble of gene products under control of the LexA repressor. To evaluate the capacity of the mutant proteins to induce the SOS response, we measured β-galactosidase production in bacteria carrying acea::lacZ fusion (Table I), where cea possesses a promoter regulated by the LexA protein. β-Galactosidase induction in ΔrecA bacteria transformed with pCCrecA reached a plateau of 4.5 times basal level 30 min after irradiation. Bacteria expressing RecAE207K induced β-galactosidase by a factor of 2 after 120 min, and RecAE207Q protein did not induce the SOS response as previously reported (14Larminat F. Cazaux C. Germanier M. Defais M. J. Bacteriol. 1992; 174: 6264-6269Crossref PubMed Google Scholar).Table IPhenotype of bacteria expressing wild type and mutant RecA proteinsSOS induction factor1-aMaximum level of β-galactosidase after exposure to 10 J/m2 UV radiation relative to uninduced cells.Intrachromosomal recombination1-bNumber of papillae relative to wt bacteria.Interchromosomal recombination1-cNumber of genetic crosses relative to wt bacteria.%wtRecA4.5100100RecAE207K21250RecAE207Q1-dRef. 14.100.00041-a Maximum level of β-galactosidase after exposure to 10 J/m2 UV radiation relative to uninduced cells.1-b Number of papillae relative to wt bacteria.1-c Number of genetic crosses relative to wt bacteria.1-d Ref. 14Larminat F.

Bacteria expressing RecAE207K protein carried out intrachromosomal recombination with 12% efficiency of wild type (Table I); no activity was found with RecAE207Q as previously reported (14Larminat F. Cazaux C. Germanier M. Defais M. J. Bacteriol. 1992; 174: 6264-6269Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The mutation E207K also reduced interchromosomal recombination by 2-fold (Table I), whereas bacteria expressing RecAE207Q were inactive (14Larminat F. Cazaux C. Germanier M. Defais M. J. Bacteriol. 1992; 174: 6264-6269Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). To understand the molecular bases of these phenotypic differences, we purified wild type and mutant proteins and compared their biochemical activities in vitro. Some features of homologous recombination are exhibited in vitroby a DNA strand exchange reaction between single and double stranded M13 phage DNA in the presence of E. coli single stranded binding protein and the stable ATP analog ATPγS. wtRecA protein carries out strand exchange in these reaction conditions, and RecAE207Q is inactive (22Cazaux C. Larminat F. Villani G. Johnson N.P. Schnarr M. Defais M. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 8246-8254Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar); RecAE207K catalyzed strand exchange as efficiently as wild type protein (Fig. 2). We also compared strand exchange activity of these proteins in the presence of an ATP regenerating system. Under these conditions the extent of the reaction increased; both wtRecA and RecAE207K converted 80% ssDNA into dsDNA products. However, kinetics were significantly slower for the RecAE207K protein; half reaction of mutant protein was observed after 30 min as compared with 10 min with wtRecA. RecAE207Q was inactive. RecA protein also exhibits DNA-dependent ATPase activity. ATP hydrolysis was examined in nucleoprotein filaments formed by poly(dT) (25Brenner S.L. Mitchell R.S. Morrical S.W. Neuendorf S.K. Schutte B.C. Cox M.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 4011-4016Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In one set of experiments, initial rates of ATP hydrolysis were measured using 3.0 μm poly(dT) and varying the concentration of wtRecA or mutant RecA proteins. As shown in Fig. 3 a hydrolysis rates were the same for wtRecA and RecAE207K and reached a maximum value of 30 μm/min. The maximum hydrolysis rate of RecAE207Q was 50% of wild type protein. Stoichiometries of the saturated nucleoprotein filament were calculated by extrapolating the low concentration region of this titration curve to the plateau. In our experiments RecA protein, RecAE207K and RecAE207Q all bound poly(dT) with a stoichiometry of 3 nucleotides/protein monomer (Table II). DNA binding at site I is both necessary and sufficient for ATPase activity of RecA protein, and the stoichiometry for binding at this site is 3 nucleotides/protein monomer (7Zlotnick A. Mitchell R.S. Steed R.K. Brenner S.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 22525-22530Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In a second set of experiments ATP hydrolysis rates were determined using 1 μm protein as a function of poly(dT) concentration. A double reciprocal plot of these data, 1/V versus1/[poly(dT)], gave values for V max and K D apparent (Fig. 3 b). Poly(dT), which lacks secondary structure, gives the maximum rate of DNA-dependent ATP hydrolysis; our kinetic parameters for wtRecA protein, k cat = 29 min−1 and K D = 1.8 μm (Table II), are in agreement with previously reported values (25Brenner S.L. Mitchell R.S. Morrical S.W. Neuendorf S.K. Schutte B.C. Cox M.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 4011-4016Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The turnover number for ATP hydrolysis by mutant proteins RecAE207K and RecAE207Q was the same as that of the wild type protein. However, the apparent dissociation constant of the mutant nucleoprotein filaments were 1.4 and 4 times larger, respectively, than wild type.Table IIKinetic parameters for ssDNA dependent ATP hydrolysis by wild type and mutant RecA proteinsStoichiometry2-aTitration of 3.0 μm poly(dT) with protein (Fig. 3 a).k cat2-bTitration of 1 μm protein with poly(dT) (Fig. 3 b); k cat = V max/total protein concentration.KDapparent2-bTitration of 1 μm protein with poly(dT) (Fig. 3 b); k cat = V max/total protein concentration.nucleotides/proteinmin−1μmRecA3.2 ± 0.229 ± 21.8RecAE207K2.9 ± 0.428 ± 22.5RecAE207Q3.0 ± 0.228 ± 37.02-a Titration of 3.0 μm poly(dT) with protein (Fig. 3 a).2-b Titration of 1 μm protein with poly(dT) (Fig. 3 b); k cat = V max/total protein concentration.

Chem. 1991; 20: 539-575Crossref PubMed Scopus (232) Google Scholar). This phenomenon can be investigated using εDNA, a fluorescent derivative of phage M13 ssDNA (16Cazenave C. Toulmé J.J. Hélène C. EMBO J. 1983; 2: 2247-2251Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar, 17Silver M.S. Fersht A.R.

Biol. 1985; 181: 281-295Crossref PubMed Scopus (252) Google Scholar). εDNA conformation can be followed by the fluorescence increase, which is a result of lengthening εDNA in the nucleoprotein filament. Stoichiometry of the protein-DNA complexes (nucleotides/protein monomer) can be determined from the concentration of protein necessary to saturate the fluorescence increase. Finally, stability of the protein-εDNA complex can be characterized by the salt titration midpoint, the salt concentration that produces loss of 50% fluorescence increase. Titrations of εDNA with RecAE207Q protein resembled in part those with wild type protein (7Zlotnick A. Mitchell R.S. Steed R.K. Brenner S.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 22525-22530Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 16Cazenave C. Toulmé J.J. Hélène C. EMBO J. 1983; 2: 2247-2251Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar, 17Silver M.S.

Without cofactor or in the presence of 100 μm ADP, εDNA fluorescence increased by a factor of 2 reflecting the formation of extended single stranded structures in both protein-DNA complexes. Titration with RecA or RecAE207Q in the presence of 100 μm ATPγS increased fluorescence 2.7 times, and the additional fluorescence signal is associated with further stretching of DNA. Although the complexes with mutant protein were dissociated by slightly higher NaCl concentrations, relative stability depended on nucleotide cofactor in the same way for RecAE207Q and wild type proteins. However, RecAE207Q-εDNA binding saturated at half the protein concentration necessary for complete binding of wtRecA (Table III). In contrast complexes of εDNA with RecAE207K had the same stoichiometry and stability as with wtRecA protein.Table IIIStoichiometry, fluorescence increase, and stability of complexes formed between protein and ɛDNA and subsequently denatured by NaClStoichiometry3-a5.7 μm ɛDNA titrated by protein.Stoichiometry3-b1 μm protein titrated by ɛDNA.Fluorescence increaseSalt titration midpointnucleotides/monomermmNaClRecA No cofactor7.2 ± 1.26.3 ± 0.52.0 ± 0.1275 ± 10 ADP7.4 ± 0.77.4 ± 0.52.1 ± 0.2170 ± 15 ATPγS10.2 ± 0.97.1 ± 0.62.7 ± 0.2>500RecAE207K No cofactor6.9 ± 0.22.2 ± 0.1280 ± 10 ADP6.8 ± 0.71.9 ± 0.1180 ± 10 ATPγS7.1 ± 0.12.8 ± 0.1>500RecAE207Q No cofactor4.0 ± 0.52.6 ± 0.32.2 ± 0.1390 ± 10 ADP4.3 ± 0.52.9 ± 0.42.2 ± 0.3320 ± 15 ATPγS5.1 ± 0.52.7 ± 0.32.7 ± 0.2>500The values are the means ± range of three or more experiments.3-a 5.7 μm ɛDNA titrated by protein.3-b 1 μm protein titrated by ɛDNA.

In some conditions nucleoprotein filaments equilibrate slowly, and the nature of the RecA-DNA complex may vary with the order of addition (7Zlotnick A. Mitchell R.S. Steed R.K. Brenner S.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 22525-22530Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar,17Silver M.S. Fersht A.R. Biochemistry. 1982; 21: 6066-6072Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). To investigate a possible effect of kinetic trapping on the stoichiometry of the RecAE207Q filament, we carried out reverse titrations where protein was titrated with εDNA (Fig. 5 and Table III). For both wild type RecA and RecAE207Q, the fluorescence of εDNA increased to the same extent in filaments with protein alone and in the presence of ADP, whereas fluorescence increased to a greater extent with ATPγS. However, saturation of RecA protein by εDNA gave a complex with twice the fluorescence intensity of the corresponding complex with RecAE207Q; as observed for titration with protein, the stoichiometry of the complexes showed that each wtRecA molecule bound twice as much εDNA (Table III). The L2 loop (195IRMKIGVMFGNPETT209) is a likely candidate for one of the ssDNA-binding sites of RecA protein. These amino acids are disordered in the RecA-ADP crystal and disposed toward the central cavity where they can interact with DNA (11Story R.M. Weber I.T. Steitz T.A. Nature. 1992; 355: 318-325Crossref PubMed Scopus (680) Google Scholar). Mutations in this region inactivate RecA protein (14Larminat F. Cazaux C. Germanier M. Defais M. J.

Biol. 1990; 211: 845-855Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). Photocross-linking experiments (12Malkov V.A. Camerini-Otero R.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 30230-30233Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar, 13Wang Y. Adzyma K. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 3563-3571Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar) show that, in the nucleoprotein filament, DNA is near the L2 loop. Finally a peptide with the sequence of the L2 loop is able to promote joint molecule formation, an early step in homologous recombination (29Voloshin O.N. Wang L. Camerini-Otero R.D. Science. 1996; 272: 868-872Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). Here we investigate the role of this sequence in protein-DNA interactions by comparing wtRecA protein with proteins carrying point mutations E207Q and E207K in the L2 loop. Both mutant proteins increased the sensitivity of bacteria to UV radiation (Fig. 1) (probably by their incapacity to induce the SOS response (Table I)), and homologous recombination in vivo was impaired (Table I). Proteins were therefore purified, and their biochemical activities and DNA binding properties were studied in vitro. RecAE207Q was unable to carry out strand exchange in vitro with ATP or ATPγS. Nevertheless mutant protein catalyzed ATP hydrolysis (22Cazaux C. Larminat F. Villani G. Johnson N.P. Schnarr M. Defais M. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 8246-8254Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), and this reaction was characterized by a stoichiometry of 3 nucleotides/protein monomer (Fig. 3 a and Table II). The same stoichiometry was also observed for wtRecA and RecAE207K and has been previously used to argue that site I binding is sufficient for ATP hydrolysis by RecA protein (7Zlotnick A. Mitchell R.S. Steed R.K. Brenner S.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 22525-22530Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The maximum stoichiometry for binding of εDNA to wtRecA and RecAE207K was 6–7 nucleotides/monomer (Figs. 5 and 6, Table III) as a result of ssDNA binding at site I and site II (7Zlotnick A. Mitchell R.S. Steed R.K. Brenner S.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 22525-22530Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In contrast the maximum binding of εDNA to RecAE207Q was half this value. These stoichiometries were observed with three independent RecAE207Q protein preparations. Assuming that both DNA-binding sites of wtRecA have a uniform size of 3–4 nucleotides/protein monomer (4Roca I.A. Cox M.M. Prog. Nucleic Acids Res. Mol. Biol. 1997; 56: 129-223Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 7Zlotnick A. Mitchell R.S. Steed R.K. Brenner S.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 22525-22530Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), the simplest interpretation of these results is that wtRecA protein has two ssDNA-binding sites, whereas mutant protein RecAE207Q has only one. Biochemical activities of the RecAE207Q protein indicate that the remaining site corresponds functionally to site I. This protein catalyzes LexA self-cleavage and hydrolyzes ATP in the presence of ssDNA (Fig. 3 and Ref. 22Cazaux C. Larminat F. Villani G. Johnson N.P. Schnarr M. Defais M. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 8246-8254Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). These biochemical activities are characteristic of the RecA nucleoprotein filament with a ssDNA molecule bound to site I (7Zlotnick A. Mitchell R.S. Steed R.K. Brenner S.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 22525-22530Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 8Takahashi M. Schnarr M. Eur. J. Biochem. 1989; 183: 617-622Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). We conclude that RecAE207Q protein has a single DNA-binding site that corresponds to a “functional” site I. The absence of the secondary binding site is likely responsible for the incapacity of RecAE207Q protein to catalyze DNA strand exchange in vitro and its inactivity in vivo (14Larminat F. Cazaux C. Germanier M. Defais M. J. Bacteriol. 1992; 174: 6264-6269Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 22Cazaux C. Larminat F. Villani G. Johnson N.P. Schnarr M. Defais M. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 8246-8254Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). If this analysis is correct, the L2 loop of the RecA protein is or is part of site II, as also suggested by photocross-linking experiments (13Wang Y. Adzyma K. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 3563-3571Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). The discovery of a mutant RecA protein with a single functional primary DNA-binding site has important implications for the mechanism of action of RecA protein. It shows that functional sites I and II correspond to distinct amino acid sequences of RecA protein. The allosteric conformation and stability changes characteristic of wild type RecA protein (5Kowalczykowski S.C. Annu. Rev. Biochem. Biophys. Chem. 1991; 20: 539-575Crossref PubMed Scopus (232) Google Scholar) are also observed with RecAE207Q (Figs. 4 and 5and Table III), i.e. upon binding ssDNA to site I without binding at the L2 loop, site II. Hence, the formation of the presynaptic filament may be both necessary and sufficient for the cofactor-dependent affinity cycle of wild type RecA protein. No major differences in stoichiometry, structure, or stability were observed for nucleoprotein filaments of wtRecA and RecAE207K in the presence of ADP, ATPγS, or without cofactor (Table III). It is therefore not surprising that RecAE207K catalyzed DNA strand exchange in vitroin the presence of ATPγS as efficiently as wild type protein (Fig. 2). However, when strand exchange was carried out with an ATP regenerating system, the reaction rate of RecAE207K was slower than wild type protein, although both proteins eventually gave 80% dsDNA products. k cat for the ATP hydrolysis reaction was the same for RecAE207K as for wild type protein, whereas the apparent dissociation constant for the DNA binding was larger for mutant protein (Fig. 3 b and Table II). Hence, inefficient ssDNA substrate binding at site I of RecAE207Kmight explain the kinetic inhibition of strand exchange in the presence of ATP. Model peptide studies suggested that the negative charge at position 207 might regulate affinity of the L2 loop for ssDNA (30Johnson N.P. Mazarguil H. Lopez A. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 19675-19679Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (7) Google Scholar). However, we observe no correlation of biochemical or biological activities of RecA with increasing positive charge at this position. An uncharged side chain (E207Q) inhibited biological functions, whereas a positive charge (E207K) reduced but did not eliminate biological activity (Fig. 1 and Table I). Therefore, a negative charge at position 207 is not necessary for RecA function. We speculate that Glu207 contributes to the water solubility of the L2 loop and that the point mutation E207Q may reduce the solubility and collapse this peptide sequence onto the protein surface where it is inaccessible to DNA. In this hypothesis, a positive or a negative charge at position 207 would equally solubilize the L2 the loop and restore activity. The biochemical and DNA binding properties of RecAE207K protein are consistent with this proposition, even though Lys207 may also perturb DNA binding and reduce the efficiency of this protein compared with wild type RecA. If this argument is correct, the role of the negative charge Gly207 would be to increase the solubility of the L2 loop without engendering parasitic electrostatic protein-DNA bonds. Negatively charged amino acids that are found in the L2 region of recombinases from phage to man (4Roca I.A. Cox M.M. Prog. Nucleic Acids Res. Mol. Biol. 1997; 56: 129-223Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) may also have this function. ATP hydrolysis requires DNA binding at site I of RecA protein. The Lineweaver-Burke plot for ATP hydrolysis as a function of poly(dT) (Fig. 3 b) shows that the effect of our point mutations in the L2 loop resembles competitive inhibition (31Fersht A. Enzyme Structure and Mechanism. W. H. Freeman & Co., New York1985: 108Google Scholar) for ssDNA binding at site I, i.e. point mutations E207Q and E207K increased the apparent K D for ATP hydrolysis without changingV max; the E207Q mutation was a more potent “inhibitor” than E207K. Protein-protein interactions play an important role in the cooperative stability of RecA-DNA nucleoprotein filaments and could influence K D of mutant proteins. However, this phenomenon is sensitive to NaCl (32Menetski J.P. Varghese A. Kowalczykowski S.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 10400-10404Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), and we observed that salt titration midpoint values were the same for wtRecA and RecAE207K and increased for RecAE207Q (Table III). Therefore protein-protein interactions are not destabilized in mutant proteins. If the mutations introduced a conformational effect that led to nonproductive DNA binding, both V maxand 1/K D would be expected to decrease, which was not observed. These considerations suggest a model to explain the “competitive inhibition” behavior of the mutant proteins. In wild type protein ssDNA binds to site I without interference from the L2 loop (Fig. 6 a). The point mutation E207Q reduces the charge, and the more hydrophobic L2 loop of the mutant protein may bind reversibly on the surface of this protein at or near site I; in this putative structure the L2 sequence would compete with ssDNA for site I (Fig. 6 b). In contrast, the mutation E207K introduces a positive charge, which would be able to bind electrostatically to DNA; hence, the L2 loop of RecAE207K could compete with site I for DNA (Fig. 6 c). The nucleoprotein filament formed in the presence of ATPγS is more stable than the corresponding ADP complex, an expected product of ATP hydrolysis (Table III, Fig. 4, and Ref. 18Menetski J.P. Kowalczykowski S.C. J. Mol. Biol. 1985; 181: 281-295Crossref PubMed Scopus (252) Google Scholar). Stabilizing ssDNA at site I of RecAE207K by ATPγS might dominate the effect of competitive binding and explain why the presynaptic complex is fully competent for DNA strand exchange on the presence of ATPγS but not ATP (Fig. 2). We thank one of the referees for constructive comments."
https://openalex.org/W2082427800,"Considerable progress has been made in the understanding of tumor necrosis factor (TNF) signaling; however, the molecular and biochemical basis of tumor resistance to the cytotoxic action of TNF are still not definitively identified yet. Although a role of c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK) pathway has been suggested as an effector in TNF signaling, its exact relative contribution and its interaction with ceramide pathway and tumor resistance to TNF remain unknown. The relationship between JNK activation and human breast adenocarcinoma MCF7 resistance acquisition to the cytotoxic action of TNF was therefore investigated. We demonstrate that TNF triggers JNK activation in both TNF-sensitive MCF7 cells and its resistant derivative, RA1/1001. In addition, when MCF7 cells were stably transfected with mitogen-activated protein kinase kinase 4 (MKK4) dominant-negative cDNA or transiently transfected with a dominant-negative c-Jun mutant (TAM 67), their susceptibility to the cytotoxic action of TNF remains comparable with control cells. We also demonstrated that JNK activation does not require ceramide generation since in MCF7 cells transfected with a dominant-negative derivative of FADD (FADD-DN), which are resistant to the cytotoxic action of TNF, TNF induced JNK activation in the absence of ceramide generation. Furthermore, our data indicate that exogenous permeable synthetic ceramide C-6 induced the killing of MCF7 cells transfected with MKK4 dominant-negative cDNA. These results provide strong evidence indicating that tumor acquisition of resistance to the cytotoxic action of TNF may occur either independently or at a level downstream of JNK activation and suggest that JNK activation is not linked to ceramide pathway in TNF-mediated apoptosis. Considerable progress has been made in the understanding of tumor necrosis factor (TNF) signaling; however, the molecular and biochemical basis of tumor resistance to the cytotoxic action of TNF are still not definitively identified yet. Although a role of c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK) pathway has been suggested as an effector in TNF signaling, its exact relative contribution and its interaction with ceramide pathway and tumor resistance to TNF remain unknown.

Tumor necrosis factor α (TNF)1 is a cytokine with powerful direct tumor-killing capability (1Chouaı̈b S. Brannelec D. Buurman W.A. Immunol. Today. 1991; 12: 141-142Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar, 2Fiers W. FEBS Lett. 1991; 285: 199-212Crossref PubMed Scopus (681) Google Scholar). This cytokine has also been shown to play a role in tumor regression mediated by cytotoxic T cells. In fact, TNF may be released by cytotoxic T cells clones and significantly contributes to the local immune response to the tumor (3Ratner A. Clark W.R. J. Immunol. 1993; 150: 4303-4314PubMed Google Scholar). Thus, when its secretion is confined to the area of tumor growth, TNF may fulfill its promise as an anticancer agent. It is well established that release of cytotoxic cytokines such as TNF triggered by T cell receptor engagement may be even more important to tumor destruction than direct lysis by cell-cell contact. This factor is now recognized as the most pleiotropic cytokine acting as a host defense factor in immunological responses and may contribute to tumor cell destruction (4Aggarwal B.B. Natarajan K. Eur. Cytokine Netw. 1996; 7: 93-124PubMed Google Scholar). Whereas expression of the TNF receptor 1 (TNFR1) alone is necessary for providing a biological response, it is not sufficient to induce the cytolytic process (5Tsujimoto M. Yip Y.K. Vilcek J. Proc.

Despite the major advance in understanding the early events in TNF signaling and the identification of molecules that are recruited to TNFR1, the mechanisms of resistance to TNF observed in some tumor cells remain largely unknown. It has become clear that the initiation of intracellular signaling events through TNFR1 depends on protein intermediates that interact with specific cytoplasmic domains of this receptor. In fact, the death domain motif of TNFR1 plays a central role in the interactions between TRADD (TNFR1-associated death domain) (7Hsu H. Xiong J. Goeddel D.V.

Natarajan K. Eur. Cytokine Netw. 1996; 7: 93-124PubMed Google Scholar) and the transcription factors NF-κB (14Osborn L. Kunkel S. Nabel G.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

The prototypical JNK/SAPK pathway involves the sequential activation of mitogen-activated protein kinase kinase kinase 1, mitogen-activated protein kinase kinase 4 (MKK4), JNK, and c-Jun. The activated JNKs translocate to the nucleus where they phosphorylate transcription factors such as c-Jun and ATF2 (26Dérijard B. Hibi M. Wu I.H. Barrett T. Su B. Deng T. Karin M. Davis R.J.

MKK4 itself is phosphorylated and activated by the upstream mitogen-activated protein kinase kinase kinase 1 (30Sanchez I. Hughes R.T. Mayer B.J. Yee K. Woodgett J.R. Avruch J. Kyriakis J.M. Zon L.I.

Moreover, introduction of constitutively active mitogen-activated protein kinase kinase kinase 1 resulted in increased apoptosis in PC-12 cells, whereas dominant interfering mutants of c-Jun, a downstream target of the JNK cascade, blocked apoptosis induced by nerve growth factor withdrawal (22Xia Z.

The present data demonstrate that the resistance of MCF7 cells to the cytotoxic action of TNF is not associated with a defect in SAPK/JNK activation and emphasizes the absence of interaction between JNK and ceramide pathways in TNF-mediated apoptosis. Highly purified (>99%) recombinant TNF (specific activity 6.63 × 106 units/mg of protein) was kindly provided by Dr. Apfler Isle. (Bender Wien). N-hexanoyl-d-sphingosine (C6-ceramide) and C6- dihydroceramide were purchased from Matreya (Pleasant Gap, PA). [9,10-3H]palmitic acid and [methyl-3H]choline were purchased from NEN Life Science Products. DAPI (4′,6′-diamidino-2-phenylindole) was purchased from Sigma. TNF-resistant cells, 1001, were derived from RA-1 cells transfected by p55 TNF receptor cDNA as described (6Cai Z. Bettaieb A. El Mahdani N. Legrès L.G. Stancou R. Masliah J. Chouaı̈b S. J. Biol.

Dixit (University of Michigan Medical School, Michigan). MKK4-DN-expressing cells were obtained by stable transfection of the MCF7 cells with an expression vector encoding MKK4 dominant-negative cDNA. All cell lines were routinely cultured in RPMI 1640 medium containing 5% fetal calf serum, 1% penicillin-streptomycin, 1%l-glutamine at 37 °C in a humidified atmosphere with 5% CO2. Cells were seeded in 96-well plates (7 × 104 cells/ml) and treated either with human recombinant TNF, synthetic cell-permeable C6-ceramide, or with C6-dihydroceramide. After incubation for 72 h with TNF or 48 h with ceramide at 37 °C, the medium was replaced with 0.5% crystal-violet solution. Plates were then incubated for 10 min at room temperature and washed, and viable crystal-violet-stained cells were lysed with 1% SDS. Absorbance (A), proportional to cell viability, was then measured at 540 nm. Cell lysis was assessed by comparing the viability of untreated cells versus treated cells using the following calculation: cell viability (%) = 100 × (A1/Ao); cell lysis (%) = 1 − cell viability (%), where A1 and Ao were the absorbance obtained from treated and untreated cells, respectively. The main value of quadruplicate was used for analysis. Cells were incubated in RPMI medium containing 5% fetal calf serum and labeled with 0.5 μCi/ml [9,10-3H]palmitic acid (35.9 Ci/mmol) for ceramide analysis or 0.5 μCi/ml [methyl-3H]choline for sphingomyelin analysis. After 48 h of incubation, the medium was removed, and cells were washed several times with phosphate-buffered saline. Cells (5 × 106) were then resuspended and treated with TNF (50 ng/ml) for various times. Lipids were extracted by the method of Bligh and Dyer (41Bligh E.G. Dyer W.S. Can. J. Biochem. Physiol. 1959; 37: 911-919Crossref PubMed Scopus (43133) Google Scholar) and separated by thin layer chromatography (TLC) using as developing solvent systems for ceramide analysis chloroform/methanol/water (100:42:6) followed by a second step using hexane/diethyl ether/formic acid (55:45:1). For sphingomyelin analysis, lipids were separated using chloroform/methanol/water (70:35:5). Radioactive lipid spots were detected upon exposure to iodine vapor, scraped into scintillation fluid, and counted. The positions of ceramide on TLC plates were determined by comparison with concomitantly run nonradioactive ceramide (type III) (Sigma). Statistical analysis was performed using Student's ttest. JNK activity was performed as described previously (41Bligh E.G. Dyer W.S. Can. J. Biochem. Physiol. 1959; 37: 911-919Crossref PubMed Scopus (43133) Google Scholar, 42Atfi A. Djelloul S. Chastre E.

Briefly, cells were lysed at 4 °C in lysis buffer containing 25 mm HEPES (pH 7.5), 0.3m NaCl, 1.5 mm MgCl2, 0.2 mm EDTA, 0.5 mm dithiothreitol, 1% Triton X-100, 0.5% sodium deoxycholate, 20 nmβ-glycerophosphate, 1 mm sodium vanadate, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 20 μg/ml aprotinin, and 20 μg/ml leupeptin. Lysates were centrifuged at 25,000 ×g for 15 min, and JNK was immunoprecipitated from the supernatants at 4 °C for 2 h using affinity-purified rabbit anti-JNK antibody (Santa Cruz Biotech, CA). Immunocomplexes were immobilized on Sepharose-coupled protein G for 30 min at 4 °C (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) and washed twice in lysis buffer and once in kinase buffer consisting of 12.5 mm MOPS (pH 7.5), 12.5 mm β-glycerophosphate, 7.5 mmMgCl2, 0.5 mm EGTA, 0.5 mm sodium fluoride, 0.5 mm sodium vanadate. After washing, the immunoprecipitates were resuspended in buffer supplemented with 2 μg of GST-Jun (amino acids 1–79), 20 μm unlabeled ATP, and 5 μCi of [γ-32P]ATP. After incubation at 30 °C for 20 min, the reaction was stopped by the addition of SDS sample buffer. Samples were analyzed by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and autoradiographed. Proteins were separated on 10% SDS-polyacrylamide gels and electroblotted onto hybondTMmembranes (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). After blocking, the membranes were probed with anti-JNK polyclonal antibody (Santa Cruz Biotech) as described elsewhere (43Atfi A. Lepage K. Allard P. Chapdelaine A. Chevalier S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci U. S. A. 1995; 92: 12110-12114Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). The complexes were detected using enhanced chemiluminescence detection kit (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) and autoradiography. For transient transfection, cells were plated overnight at a density of 105/60-mm plate and then co-transfected with vector encoding the dominant-negative mutant of Jun pCMVTAM67 (27Gupta S.

Science. 1995; 267: 389-393Crossref PubMed Scopus (1339) Google Scholar) together with the pE-GFP vector (CLONTECH) expression vector encoding for the green fluorescent protein, according to the manufacturer instructions (Qiagen). After 24 h, cells were subsequently treated or not with TNF (50 ng/ml) for 16 h. For apoptosis analysis, cells were stained with DAPI at a concentration of 1 mm (Sigma) and examined with a Zeiss Axiophot fluorescent microscope. For stable transfection, MCF7 cells were transfected with the MKK4 dominant-negative cDNA inserted in the mammalian expression vector pc-DNA3 or with an empty vector (control) and selected for 3 weeks with G418 sulfate (Sigma) at a concentration of 0.5 mg/ml. Individual clones were pooled, and cells were then subjected to TNF treatment and harvested for the cytotoxic or JNK assays. To further analyze the biochemical basis of cell resistance acquisition to the cytotoxic action of TNF, we first performed experiments to investigate the possible implication of the JNK/SAPK pathway in the acquisition of MCF7 resistance to the cytotoxic action of TNF. For this purpose, we have used the TNF-sensitive human breast adenocarcinoma MCF7 cell line and its well characterized TNF-resistant variant (RA1/1001) established by prolonged culture of MCF7 in the presence of increasing concentrations of TNF (6Cai Z.

As expected, over 70% MCF7 cells undergo apoptotic cell death in response to TNF, whereas less than 10% RA1/1001 clone exhibited such a phenotype (Table I). The resistance exhibited by these cells was not due to a lack of TNF receptor expression or TNF signaling (6Cai Z. Bettaieb A. El Mahdani N. Legrès L.G. Stancou R. Masliah J. Chouaı̈b S. J. Biol.

Cell viability was measured using the crystal violet assay as described under “Experimental Procedures.” Data presented are the means ±S.D. of quadruplicate determinations. To determine whether the RA1/1001 cell resistance to the cytotoxic action of TNF interferes with JNK activation, JNK activity was examined in these cells by an immunocomplex assay with GST-c-Jun as substrate (46Minden A. Lin A. Claret F.G. Abo A. Karin M. Cell. 1995; 81: 1159-1170Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1447) Google Scholar, 47Coso O.A. Chiariello M., Yu, J.C. Teramoto H. Crespo P. Xu N. Miki T. Gutkind J.C. Cell. 1995; 81: 1137-1146Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1570) Google Scholar). As shown in Fig. 1 A, JNK was similarly activated in both MCF7 and RA1/1001 clone. Kinetic studies showed that optimal induction of JNK was observed after 15–30 min of exposure to TNF. Immunoblotting of cell lysates with anti-JNK antibody revealed that JNK1 protein level remained constant under TNF treatment (Fig. 1 C). The data in Fig. 1, panel C, also indicate that RA1/1001 cells contain more JNK protein than in MCF7 cells. These data suggest the absence of a causal correlation between activation of JNK and the acquisition of resistance to the cytotoxic action of TNF by MCF7 cells. Experiments were performed to examine whether inactivation of the JNK pathway interferes with MCF7 resistance to the cytotoxic action of TNF. We therefore examined the ability of dominant interfering mutants of MKK4 to inhibit JNK activation and cell death in response to TNF. Therefore, we stably transfected MCF7 cells with an expressing vector encoding a dominant-negative mutant of MKK4 (MKK4 ala), which has a single mutation at the ATP-binding site, abrogating the kinase activity (31Dérijard B. Raingeaud J. Barrett T. Wu I.H. Han J. Ulevitch R.J. Davis R.J. Science. 1995; 267: 682-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (1415) Google Scholar). Fig. 2 A shows that stable expression of MKK4 ala inhibited (70%) the activation of JNK by TNF, indicating that TNF signaling leading to JNK activation was specifically blocked in MCF7-transfected cells. Furthermore, when expressed with an hemagglutinin epitope-tagged JNK in a transient transfection assay, MKK4 ala suppressed TNF-induced JNK activation (Fig. 2 B). Interestingly, the data depicted in Fig. 3 B demonstrate that such transfection did not result in the alteration of MCF7 sensitivity to the cytotoxic action of TNF, as compared with control cells (MCF7/pc-DNA3). A similar conclusion could be drawn when these experiments were performed using MCF7 cells transiently co-transfected with MKK4 ala and an expression vector encoding green fluorescent protein, which allows the identification of transfected cells. DAPI staining showed that inhibition of the JNK pathway in MKK4-DN-transfected cells did not interfere with TNF-induced apoptosis in these cells (data not shown). It is therefore unlikely that JNK activation plays a direct role in TNF-induced programmed cell death in MCF7 cells.Figure 3Activation of JNK in the absence of ceramide generation. Vector control (closed circles) and FADD-DN (open circles) transfected MCF7 cells were prelabeled with either [methyl-3H]choline (for sphingomyelin analysis) (A and B) or [9,10-3H]palmitic acid (for ceramide analysis) (B) for 48 h in 1% fetal calf serum. Cells (5 × 106) were treated with 50 ng/ml TNF for the time intervals indicated. Labeled sphingomyelin (SM) and ceramide were resolved by analytic thin layer chromatography as described under “Experimental Procedures.” Results are expressed as the percentage of untreated controls. Results are the mean ±S.E. of three independent experiments (*, p < 0.05). C, activation of JNK by TNF in vector control and FADD-DN-transfected MCF7 cells. Cells were treated with the indicated concentrations of TNF for 15 min. Cells lysates were subjected to in vitro kinase assay, and the phosphorylated GST-Jun proteins were resolved by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and visualized by autoradiography. D, kinetic analysis of JNK activation by TNF. MCF7 cells and FADD-DN-transfected MCF7 cells were incubated in the absence (lanes 1 and 6) or in the presence of TNF (50 ng/ml) for various time periods. Cell lysates were assessed for JNK activity. E, the level of JNK-1 expression was determined by immunoblotting with JNK-1 antibody.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) To provide further evidence that inactivation of JNK cascade does not significantly contribute to apoptosis triggered by TNF, we examined the effect of the dominant interfering mutant of c-Jun (TAM 67) on TNF-induced MCF7 cell death. TAM 67 acts as a dominant-inhibitor due to a deletion in the N-terminal transactivation domain of c-Jun that includes the binding site for JNK (27Gupta S. Campbell D. Dérijard B. Davis R.J. Science. 1995; 267: 389-393Crossref PubMed Scopus (1339) Google Scholar, 44Rapp U.L. Troppmair J. Beck T. Birrer M.J. Oncogene. 1994; 9: 33493-33498Google Scholar). MCF7 cells were transiently co-transfected with TAM 67 and green fluorescent protein. As shown by DAPI staining, treatment of transfected cells with TNF induced condensation and fragmentation of the nucleus (Fig. 2 C), consistent with apoptosis, irrespective of whether these cells are transfected with control expression vector or TAM 67. To provide evidence that MCF7 cells expressed sufficient levels of TAM 67 to block c-Jun activity, we tested the ability of TAM 67 to inhibit the transcriptional activity of c-Jun. When fused to the DNA binding domain of the yeast transactivator Gal4 (1–147), Jun proteins can activate transcription from a promoter containing a luciferase reporter gene under the control of Gal4 binding sites linked to an E1b TATA. As expected, expression of TAM 67 inhibits the activation of Gal4-Jun reporter in response to TNF. These results, together with the inability of MKK4 ala to block TNF-mediated cell death, are consistent with a model in which TNF-mediated JNK activation and cell death occur through independent mechanisms in MCF7 cell model. Although a coordinated regulation of apoptosis via the sphingomyelin pathway and JNK has been suggested (22Xia Z. Dickens M. Raingeaud J. Davis R.J. Greenberg M.E.

https://openalex.org/W2065103714,"To further characterize the mechanistic basis for cellular resistance/hypersensitivity to anticancer drugs, a yeast genetic system was used to select a mutant type II topoisomerase that conferred cellular resistance to CP-115,953, amsacrine, etoposide, and ellipticine. The mutant enzyme contained a single point mutation that converted Gly437 → Ser (top2G437S). Purified top2G437S displayed wild-type enzymatic activity in the absence of drugs but exhibited two properties that were not predicted by the cellular resistance phenotype. First, in the absence of ATP, it was hypersensitive to all of the drugs examined and hypersensitivity correlated with increased drug affinity. Second, in the presence of ATP, top2G437S lost its hypersensitivity and displayed wild-type drug sensitivity. Since the resistance of yeast harboring top2G437S could not be explained by alterations in enzyme-drug interactions, physiological levels of topoisomerase II were determined. The Gly437 → Ser mutation reduced the stability of topoisomerase II and decreased the cellular concentration of the enzyme. These findings suggest that the physiological drug resistance phenotype conferred by top2G437S results primarily from its decreased stability. This study highlights the need to analyze both the biochemistry and the physiology of topoisomerase II mutants with altered drug sensitivity in order to define the mechanistic bridge that links enzyme function to cellular phenotype."
https://openalex.org/W2038808162,"The kinase splitting membranal proteinase (KSMP), was recently shown to be identical with the β-subunit of meprin. Meprin is a metalloendoproteinase located in brush border membranes and composed of the two types of subunits, α and β. Despite their high sequence homology and similar domain organization, meprin subunits are differently processed during maturation; meprin α is retained in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER), and undergoes a proteolytic removal of the transmembrane and cytoplasmic domains, prior to its export from this organelle. In contrast, meprin β retains these domains even after reaching its final destination in the plasma membrane. Using truncated mutants of rat meprin β expressed in Cos-7 and human embryonic kidney (HEK) 293 cells, we show here that the cytoplasmic tail is indispensable for its exit from the ER. A meprin β mutant lacking the last 25 amino acids is shown to be transport-incompetent, although it does not contain any of the known ER retention signals. Systematic analysis of the rate of the ER to Golgi transport using a series of mutants with Ala or Pro substitutions in the tail, suggests that while no specific amino acid residue by itself is imperative for normal intracellular trafficking of meprin β, the insertion of a bend at a distinct position in the tail (specifically by a Y685P mutation) suffices to retain this protein in the ER. We propose that the very length of the cytoplasmic tail, as well as its secondary structure are essential for the ER to Golgi transport of meprin β, possibly by allowing an interaction with a cargo receptor.

The proteinase was shown to clip the catalytic subunit of PKA (C-subunit) with the formation of a distinct cleavage product devoid of kinase activity (2Alhanaty E. Patinkin J. Tauber-Finkelstein M. Shaltiel S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1981; 78: 3492-3495Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). Recently we demonstrated that the C-subunit degrading activity of KSMP can be quantitatively reproduced by the β-subunit of meprin (3Chestukhin A. Muradov K. Litovchick L. Shaltiel S. J. Biol.

Top. Cell. Regul. 1986; 28: 263-290Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar, 9Johnson G.D. Hersh L.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 13505-13512Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). It was previously proposed that meprins might be involved in the degradation of some biologically active peptides such as bradykinin, angiotensin, and substance P (6Bond J.S. Beynon R.J. Protein Sci. 1995; 4: 1247-1261Crossref PubMed Scopus (357) Google Scholar), emphasizing that meprin subunits differ in their specificity. For example, it was shown that bradykinin is a good substrate for mouse meprin A (which is assumed to be either a hetero-oligomer of α- and β-subunits or homo-oligomer of α-subunits), but not for meprin B (a homo-oligomer of β-subunits) (11Kounnas M.Z. Wolz R.L. Gorbea C.M. Bond J.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 17350-17357Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Furthermore, we have recently demonstrated that while the rat meprin β-subunit cleaves the C-subunit of PKA, the meprin α-subunit did not cleave this kinase under the same experimental conditions (4Chestukhin A. Litovchick L. Muradov K. Batkin M. Shaltiel S. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 3153-3160Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). The physiological targets and the exact role of meprins are still not established. Nevertheless, specificity studies carried out recently in our laboratory showed that the peptide hormone gastrin (which is physiologically accessible to this ecto-proteinase), has a significantly lower K mthan any other previously tested substrate of meprin β). Since this peptide hormone is inactivated by such cleavage, we proposed that gastrin may well be an in vivo substrate of meprin β (4Chestukhin A. Litovchick L. Muradov K. Batkin M. Shaltiel S. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 3153-3160Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). Despite the high sequence homology and similar domain structure, the different meprin subunits undergo different post-translational proteolytic processing. The cDNA structure of both α- and β-subunits of meprin predicts the presence of carboxyl-terminal, cytoplasmic, transmembrane, and epidermal growth factor-like domains, which are all still present in the mature β-subunit, but removed from the α-subunit in the course of its maturation (10Johnson G.D. Hersh L.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 7682-7688Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 12Grunberg J. Dumermuth E. Eldering J.A. Sterchi E.E.

J. 1995; 309: 683-688Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). In addition, the α-subunit of meprin also differs from the β-subunit by possessing a domain (denoted the I domain) which is both necessary and sufficient for the proteolytic processing of the immature α-subunit (15Marchand P. Tang J. Johnson G.D. Bond J.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 5449-5456Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). It was recently reported that the α-subunit of the human analog of meprin is retained in the endoplasmic reticulum until the proteolytic removal of the transmembrane and cytoplasmic domains is completed, and that the cytoplasmic tail of this subunit of human meprin is responsible for its retention in the endoplasmic reticulum (16Hahn D. Lottaz D. Sterchi E.E. Eur. J. Biochem. 1997; 247: 933-941Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). Since only the β-subunit of meprin possesses the cytoplasmic tail in its mature form, we attempted to establish the functional assignment of this tail, using constructs of meprin β with various mutations in this region (expressed in mammalian cells), and monitoring their properties and their localization. Here we show that the segment Tyr679 to Asn700 of the rat meprin β is indispensable for its transport of from the endoplasmic reticulum to the Golgi complex. A meprin β mutant, lacking the last 25 amino acids, is shown to be transport-incompetent, although it does not contain any of the known ER retention signals. It seems, therefore, that not only the two meprin subunits have different mechanisms of maturation and targeting, but that their carboxyl-terminal tail is involved in this process in a different manner. In the α-subunit, the tail is involved in its retention in the endoplasmic reticulum (16Hahn D. Lottaz D. Sterchi E.E. Eur. J. Biochem. 1997; 247: 933-941Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar) to allow it to undergo the proteolytic cleavage(s) necessary for the export of this subunit to the cell exterior. The results presented here show that, in the case of the β-subunit, the carboxyl-terminal tail is essential for the exit of the enzyme from the ER and its subsequent transport to the Golgi apparatus. Mutants of meprin β truncated at their carboxyl terminus were constructed by introducing stop codons at the positions 680, 690, 695, and 700 in the sequence of rat meprin β by PCR using Pwo polymerase (Boehringer Mannheim. Germany). For all reactions, the sense oligonucleotide primer 5′-CTGAGGTACCGAGCTTGCAACTTTGAAAGCCAC-3′ carrying aKpnI restriction site was used, and the rat meprin β cDNA (3Chestukhin A. Muradov K. Litovchick L. Shaltiel S. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 30272-30280Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar) subcloned in pBlueScript vector (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA) served as a template. Antisense oligonucleotides with aBamHI restriction site were designed as follows: 5′-ATTGGATCCGGGTTCAGTAGACGCTGATA-3′ (stop 680), 5′-GCTGGATCCTTTGCTCAAGCCTTCTTAC-3′ (stop 690), 5′-GGTTTTCTGGATCCATTCATGCTGTC-3′ (stop 695), 5′-AACGGATCCTGTTATTCTAGATTCATGG-3′ (stop 700). PCR amplified fragments were digested by the indicated restriction enzymes, and subcloned into a pcDNA3 vector (Invitrogen, San Diegeo, CA) for expression in mammalian cells. Amino acid substitutions in the tail were introduced by directed mutagenesis using PCR and overlapping mutagenic primers (17Ausubel F.M. Brent R. Kingston R.E. Moore D.D. Seidman J.G. Smith J.A. Struhl K. Current Protocols in Molecular Biology.in: Kaaren J. John Wiley & Sons, New York1994Google Scholar). In all constructs, the mutations were confirmed by DNA sequencing. The human cell line HEK 293 and monkey Cos-7 cells were grown on 35 mm plastic tissue culture dishes (Nunc, Napperville, CT) in DMEM with 10% fetal calf serum and standard antibiotics. For transient transfection experiments, subconfluent cells were incubated for 5 h at 37 °C with the precipitate prepared from 2 μg of the plasmid DNA of interest using the LipofectAMINETM reagent (Life Technologies, Inc.). Cells were analyzed for expression of the recombinant proteins 48 h after adding the precipitate. For the stable expression of the βΔ25 mutant, HEK 293 cells were transfected with a βΔ25/pcDNA3 construct, and clones were selected as described earlier (3Chestukhin A. Muradov K. Litovchick L. Shaltiel S. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 30272-30280Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). The trypsin activation of the expressed meprin β (including mutants), and the C-subunit degradation assay were performed as described earlier (3Chestukhin A. Muradov K. Litovchick L. Shaltiel S. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 30272-30280Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). Azocaseinolytic activity was measured according to Wolz and Bond (18Wolz R.L. Bond J.S. Methods Enzymol. 1995; 248: 325-345Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar), using the mock-transfected HEK 293 cells as a control. The HEK 293 cells (transfected as above) were incubated before labeling (5–8 h) in methionine-free DMEM supplemented with 5% fetal calf serum. Cells were then pulse-labeled by incubation in the same medium (0.5 ml/35-mm tissue culture dish) containing 50 μCi/ml [35-S]methionine (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) for 15 min, and chased by the complete medium for the indicated time. Then the cells were lysed in a radioimmune precipitation buffer (19Harlow E. Lane D. Antibodies: A Laboratory Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1988Google Scholar) containing proteinase inhibitors (CompleteTM EDTA-free proteinase inhibitors mixture (Boehringer Mannheim, Germany)) for 30 min at 4 °C with constant rocking. Lysates were cleared by centrifugation at 15,000 × g for 15 min at 4 °C and incubated with 1 μl of the anti-meprin β serum and 10 μl of the Affi-PrepTM Protein A Support (Bio-Rad) for 1 h at 4 °C. Precipitates were collected by centrifugation and washed three times in the radioimmune precipitation buffer before assay. Protein samples for the deglycosylation experiments were denatured by boiling for 10 min in a 50 mm sodium acetate buffer, pH 5.5, containing 2% SDS and 10 mm β-mercaptoethanol, and divided into equal aliquots. These aliquots were diluted 5-fold with the buffer recommended by the glycosidase manufacturer, containing a proteinase inhibitors mixture (CompleteTM EDTA-free mixture, Boehringer Mannheim, Germany). Samples were incubated overnight at 37 °C with or without endo-β-N-acetyglucosaminidase H (Endo H, Boehringer Mannheim, Germany), or N-Glycanase® (peptide-N-glycosidase F or PNGase F, Genzyme, Cambridge, MA) and analyzed by SDS-PAGE (20Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (207537) Google Scholar). The HEK 293 cells were transiently transfected on 35-mm plastic tissue culture dishes as described above (each series of transfections included the wild type meprin β and five different mutants). Cells then were plated on 24-well plate (Nunc) and metabolically labeled as described above, using a 5-min pulse of [35S]methionine (20 μCi/well), then chased by complete medium for 0–60 min at 37 °C. At different time points, cells were lysed in the radioimmune precipitation buffer, and proteins were immunoprecipitated and treated with Endo H as described above. After resolving of the proteins on SDS-PAGE, the amount of the Endo H-resistant and sensitive forms of the expressed meprin β or its mutants were measured by a PhosphoImager (Fujix Bas 1000, Fuji Foto Film, Ltd., Japan) using MacBas 2.0 software. The ratio between the Endo H-resistant and the sensitive forms for each protein was plotted as a function of time, and a slope was extracted from the linear curve fit. The slope values were designated as Endo H resistance and expressed as percent of that of the wild type meprin β. Cell staining was performed essentially as described in Harlow and Lane (19Harlow E. Lane D. Antibodies: A Laboratory Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1988Google Scholar). Cells growing on glass coverslips were rinsed twice with PBS before fixation in PBS containing 4% paraformaldehyde (fixing solution), and permeabilized (where specified) by treatment for 2 min with the fixing solution containing 0.1% Triton X-100. The cells were subsequently incubated with anti-meprin β immune serum (diluted 1:500 in PBS), and with goat anti-rabbit TRITC conjugated antibodies (Sigma). Immunofluorescence was monitored using a fluorescence microscope (Nikon, Japan). Photographs were taken with a LIS-700 video camera (APPLItec, Israel). HEK 293/β (3Chestukhin A. Muradov K. Litovchick L. Shaltiel S. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 30272-30280Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar) and 293/βΔ25 cells were grown to confluence on 15-cm tissue culture dishes in DMEM, supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum, a standard mixture of antibiotics, and 0.2 mg/ml G418. Cells were fixed on the plates with a PBS buffer (containing 1% glutharaldehyde and 3% paraformaldehyde) for 1 h at room temperature, and the ultrathin frozen sections were prepared as described by Himmelhoch (21Himmelhoch S. Microsc. Res. Tech. 1994; 29: 23-28Crossref PubMed Scopus (4) Google Scholar). The anti-meprin β immune serum or normal rabbit serum (diluted 1:25), and goat anti-rabbit IgG (10-nm gold-conjugated, Zymed Laboratories Inc. Laboratories, San-Francisco, CA), were used for the detection of the immunocomplexes. Electron micrographs were taken at magnifications of 15,000–34,000 with a Philips 410 electron microscope operated at 80 kV. Protein samples were analyzed by 10% SDS-PAGE under reducing conditions, as described in the literature (20Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (207537) Google Scholar). The proteins were either stained by Coomassie Blue R-250 (Serva, Germany), or subjected to Western blotting according to Harlow and Lane (19Harlow E. Lane D. Antibodies: A Laboratory Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1988Google Scholar). Typically, a dilution of 1:15,000 of anti-meprin β immune serum was used. For visualization of the cross-reactive material, horseradish peroxidase-conjugated goat anti-rabbit antibodies (Transduction Laboratories, Lexington, KY), and an ECL detection system (Amersham, UK) were used. In an attempt to assess the possible functional assignment of the cytoplasmic tail of KSMP/meprin β we prepared meprin β mutants systematically truncated in their carboxyl-terminal part (see Scheme FS1). A comparison of the carboxyl-terminal sequences of the human (PPHβ) and of rat meprin β (9Johnson G.D. Hersh L.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 13505-13512Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 22Eldering J.A. Grunberg J. Hahn D. Croes H.J. Fransen J.A. Sterchi E.E. Eur. J. Biochem. 1997; 247: 920-932Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar) revealed three distinct segments within the tail having a different level of sequence identity, a highly conserved cluster of basic amino acids following the transmembrane domain, another conserved region in the last six-amino acid fragment of the tail, and an in-between segment with no homology. On this basis, stop codons were introduced by PCR into positions between these regions, and the mutant enzyme molecules were then subcloned into a pcDNA3 vector for expression in mammalian cells. To test the general integrity of the cloned proteins, we translated them in vitro using the rabbit reticulocyte lysate system (Fig. 1 A). By supplementing the reaction mixture with the purified canine microsomal membranes (CMM), and subsequent purification of the membranal fraction by centrifugation, we monitored the co-translational translocation of the proteins into the membrane. As shown in Fig. 1 A, all the proteins exhibited an ability to translocate to the microsomal membrane. The increase in apparent molecular weight of the proteins translated in the presence of CMM, reflects posttranslational glycosylation by the microsomal membrane preparation, since this difference is eliminated upon treatment with PNGase F (the broad specificity glycosidase). We therefore concluded that the carboxyl-terminal truncations did not impede the initial maturation of the meprin β mutants. The constructs thus obtained were utilized to transfect HEK 293 fibroblasts, monitoring the expression of the cloned proteins with polyclonal antibodies raised against purified meprin β (4Chestukhin A. Litovchick L. Muradov K. Batkin M. Shaltiel S. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 3153-3160Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). In an attempt to assess the effect of carboxyl-terminal truncations on the enzyme activity, we tested the proteolytic activities of nonactivated and of trypsin-activated wild type meprin β and of its mutants on two previously characterized KSMP/meprin β substrates, the catalytic subunit of PKA (3Chestukhin A. Muradov K. Litovchick L. Shaltiel S. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 30272-30280Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar) and azocasein (18Wolz R.L. Bond J.S. Methods Enzymol. 1995; 248: 325-345Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). The level of expression of each construct was determined by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay with polyclonal antibodies raised against meprin β, using as a reference the meprin β purified from the stably transfected cell line (described previously in Chestukhin et al. (4Chestukhin A. Litovchick L. Muradov K. Batkin M. Shaltiel S. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 3153-3160Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar)). As shown in Table I, all the mutants were found to have a specific activity toward azocasein and toward the C-subunit of PKA, which was similar to that of the wild type meprin β, clearly showing that the carboxyl-terminal truncations caused no major misfolding in the catalytic domain of the enzyme.Table ISpecific activities of the wild type and truncated meprin β mutants towards azocasein and catalytic subunit of PKAEnzymeAzocasein1-aActivity was measured in total 1% octyl-β-d-glucopyranoside extracts of transfected HEK 293 cells according to Wolz and Bond (18). Proteolytic activity of the extract of mock-transfected cells was used as a background.

Open table in a new tab To find out whether the carboxyl-terminal tail of KSMP/meprin β is involved in the maturation of the enzyme, we compared the intracellular transport of meprin β and mutants. Transiently expressed in 293 cells proteins were subjected to the [35S]methionine pulse-chase labeling, followed by immunoprecipitation with anti-meprin β antibodies (for details, see “Materials and Methods”). The precipitated proteins were then treated by Endo H and PNGase F in order to analyze their processing. Since Endo H is able to remove only the high mannose oligosaccharide side chains added to the proteins upon maturation in the endoplasmic reticulum, the appearance of the Endo H-resistant forms indicates the processing of the oligosaccharides by Golgi-associated enzymes. As shown in Fig. 1 B, whereas most of the amount of the full-length meprin β and βΔ5 mutant protein exhibited an Endo H-resistant glycosylation (this is evident from the appearance of slow migrating forms of the protein sensitive to the treatment with PNGase F), essentially no Endo H-resistant form of the βΔ25, βΔ15, and βΔ10 mutant proteins was accumulated under the same experimental conditions. The lack of complex glycosylation of the βΔ25, βΔ15, and βΔ10 proteins suggests that they are transport-incompetent, i.e. that they retained in the endoplasmic reticulum. This result was further confirmed by immunocytochemical visualization of the distribution of the truncated and the nontruncated meprin β within the cell. For indirect immunofluorescence studies we used transiently transfected Cos-7 cells (see “Materials and Methods”), since these cells were found to be more suitable than the HEK 293 fibroblasts for microscopy studies. The full-length meprin β is detected on the surface of the nonpermeabilized cells (Fig. 2 a), and the pattern of staining was essentially not changed upon permeabilization of the cell membrane before incubation with antibodies (Fig. 2 b). The distribution of the βΔ5 mutant was similar to that of the wild type, but with the highlighted Golgi-like compact structure. In agreement with the Endo H assay results, we observed that the βΔ25, βΔ15, and βΔ10 mutant proteins were accumulated in the perinuclear zone of the cell exhibiting a characteristic localization in the endoplasmic reticulum (Fig. 2). Thus, the carboxyl-terminal truncation of more than 10 amino acids resulted in accumulation of meprin β in the ER. To gain an insight into the possible reason for the retention of the meprin βΔ25 mutant in the ER and to minimize the possible effect of overexpression, we prepared the HEK 293 fibroblasts cell line stably expressing this mutant (293/βΔ25 cells). The meprin-βΔ25 protein was expressed at approximately the same level as the wild type meprin β in 293/β cells (Fig. 3 A) and was found to be associated with the total membranal fraction of these cells. It was not present in the culture medium or the cytoplasm, thus exhibiting essentially the same distribution as the wild type enzyme (data not shown). The apparent molecular mass of the βΔ25 mutant expressed in 293 cells was calculated to be 78 kDa by SDS-PAGE (Fig. 3 A). Such a 37-kDa decrease in molecular mass (from 115 kDa for the full-length meprin-β) cannot be attributed merely to the removal of 25 amino acids. The susceptibility of the βΔ25 mutant to the Endo H treatment proved the absence of the complex glycosylation (Fig. 3 A), which is in agreement with the results on the transiently expressed βΔ25 described above. The possibility that the molecular weight of the protein is reduced due to an additional deletion from the amino terminus was ruled out by NH2-terminal"

Therefore, the nucleotide-free form of G proteins has some of the characteristics of the GTP-bound, activated form. muscarinic K+ channels pertussis toxin. The muscarinic K+ channel (KACh)1 is an inwardly rectifying, potassium-selective channel whose activation by agonist-bound receptors is mediated by the βγ subunits of a pertussis toxin (PTX)-sensitive GTP-binding protein (reviewed in Ref.1Wickman K.D. Clapham D.E. Physiol. Rev. 1995; 75: 865-885Crossref PubMed Scopus (341) Google Scholar). In the heart, the primary components of this system of signal transduction have been identified. These include the muscarinic m2 receptor, heterotrimeric G proteins of the Gi subfamily, and the heterotetrameric channel formed by Kir3.1 (GIRK1) and Kir3.4 (GIRK4 or CIR) subunits (2Kubo Y.

Several neurotransmitter-regulated channels share the basic structural and functional features of atrial KAChchannels; therefore, the latter are considered a prototype for the study of G protein-channel interactions (6Dascal N. Cell. Signalling. 1997; 9: 551-573Crossref PubMed Scopus (265) Google Scholar). In addition, because patch clamp methods allow the study of signal transduction with high time resolution and under circumstances in which the composition of the milieu can be strictly controlled, atrial muscarinic K+channels can also be viewed as rapid, selective, and sensitive monitors of G protein function (7Breitwieser G.E. Szabo G. J. Gen. Physiol. 1988; 91: 469-493Crossref PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar, 8Szabo G. Li Y. Otero A.S. Dickey B.F. Birnbaumer L. GTPases in Biology. Handbook of Experimental Pharmacology. 108/II. 1993: 291-302Google Scholar). In the present work, we used excised, inside-out patches of atrial membranes to examine how G proteins might be affected by the total absence of intracellular nucleotides. Our results provide new insights into the behavior of a nucleotide-free form of G proteins that appears regardless of receptor occupancy and suggest that the empty α subunit shares some characteristics of the activated, GTP-bound form. Atrial myocytes were obtained from bullfrog hearts by digestion with collagenase and trypsin (9Otero A.S. Sweitzer N.M. Mol. Pharmacol. 1993; 44: 595-604PubMed Google Scholar). Pertussis toxin was a gift from Dr. Erik Hewlett (University of Virginia). G protein subunits αi2-GDP and βγ were a gift from Dr. S. Graber (West Virginia University). Protease inhibitors and nucleotides were from Boehringer Manheim, except for Mg·ATP, which was from Sigma. All other chemicals were of the highest purity available. Single channel activity in excised, inside-out atrial membrane patches was measured, stored, and analyzed essentially as described previously (10Xu L. Murphy J.M. Otero A.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 21120-21125Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). The external (pipette) solution contained 0.1 m KCl, 2.5 mm CaCl2, and 20 mm HEPES, pH 7.2 with KOH; carbamylcholine (10 μm) or atropine (1 μm) was added when noted. The internal (bath) solution contained 0.1 m KCl, 2 mm MgCl2, 1 mm EGTA-KOH, and 20 mm HEPES, pH 7.2 with KOH, supplemented with test compounds as noted. Although the exchange of bath solutions was usually performed with the aid of a rotary valve, to avoid contamination of the bath with G protein subunits or nucleotides small volumes of stock solutions of these compounds were applied directly to the recording chamber. To ensure the access of bath solution to the intracellular aspect of the membranes, after the formation of a patch the tip of the pipette was briefly passed through the air-bath solution interface. Additionally, single channel kinetics, activation of ATP-sensitive K+ channels after patch excision, and/or sensitivity to G protein subunits or guanine nucleotides were taken as an indication that a closed vesicle had not formed during excision. Channel activity in patches is reported as the number of channels (N) multiplied by the probability of being open (Po). To determine the relative channel activities, the NPo during a period of 2 min at the end of the application of control or test solutions to a patch was averaged. The value obtained in the test solution was then normalized to the control NPo . Many of the patches examined during this study contained some other types of ion channels, the most prominent being the ATP-sensitive channel of atrial myocytes, which opens when cytoplasmic ATP is reduced or absent. These channels differed markedly from KACh in unitary conductance (2.9 pA for KACh and 5.4 pA for ATP-sensitive K+ channels under our conditions) and bursting behavior. Therefore, the NPo values reported here for KACh channels were calculated after a selection of events with amplitudes in the range of 2.4–3.5 pA. Although this procedure underestimates the number of KAChopenings by eliminating simultaneous openings of two or more muscarinic K+ channels, it minimizes the contribution of ATP-sensitive K+ channels to the results. NPo diaries were constructed by plotting NPo values calculated over consecutive periods of 12.3 s as a function of time. Results are reported as means ± S.E. Pertussis toxin was activated as described previously (10Xu L. Murphy J.M. Otero A.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 21120-21125Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar) and diluted to a final toxin concentration of 1 μg/ml with bath solution containing 1 mm NAD before application to patches. Patches of frog atrial membranes were formed without agonist in the pipette (external) solution and subsequently excised into a bath (internal) solution containing no nucleotides. At first, the patches remained silent (Fig. 1 A); if ATP-sensitive K+ channels were present, these were active for a short period and then closed, presumably due to dephosphorylation (11Findlay I. Dunne M.J. Pfluegers Archiv. 1986; 407: 238-240Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar). After a variable delay (0.2–5 min), openings of another channel were detectable in 76% of the patches examined (349 of 459 patches). The activity of this channel increased gradually, reaching a steady level within 20 min of recording. The channel was characterized by a single channel slope conductance of 41 pS, strong inward rectification, bursting behavior (Fig. 1 A), and a mean open time of 1.5 ms (n = 3). When the total K+ concentration in the bath was changed from 107.3 to 57.3 mm, the single channel reversal potential shifted by +15.5 mV, in good agreement with the theoretical value expected for a K+ selective channel, +16.1 mV (data not shown). These properties are identical to those of the muscarinic K+ channels present in atrial cells (KACh; Refs. 12Kurachi Y. Nakajima T. Sugimoto T. Am. J. Physiol. 1986; 251: H681-H684Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 13Logothetis D.E. Kurachi Y. Galper J. Neer E.J. Clapham D.E.

(Lond.). 1990; 424: 229-251Crossref Scopus (28) Google Scholar). Nevertheless, the time course, the rate of activation, the conductance, and the gating properties of these channels were not significantly affected by the presence or absence of a muscarinic agonist (carbamylcholine, 10 μm) or an antagonist (atropine, 1 μm) in the pipette (Fig. 2). Moreover, a comparison of the final levels of channel activity attained in the absence of ligands (NPo = 0.018 ± 0.006; n = 6), with atropine (NPo = 0.031 ± 0.015;n = 5), and with carbamylcholine (NPo = 0.087 ± 0.037; n = 6) shows no significant differences (t test,p > 0.05), suggesting that channel activation in nucleotide-free solutions is a receptor-independent process. Because stimulation of KACh channel activity by muscarinic receptors is mediated by a heterotrimeric G protein and therefore requires GTP, our results suggest that a prolonged exposure of atrial membranes to nucleotide-free solutions alters the mechanism of activation of KACh channels to the extent that the dependence on activated receptors and GTP ceases to exist.Figure 2Muscarinic ligands have no effect on muscarinic K+ channel activation in nucleotide-free solutions. Conditions were as described in the Fig. 1 legend, but the pipette solution contained 10 μm carbamylcholine (top panels) or 1 μm atropine (bottom panels). The left panels (A) show continuous recordings of channel activity. The recording obtained in the presence of atropine (bottom left panel) contains two channels aside from KACh. The larger channel that is very active in the early portion of the experiment and eventually runs down is the ATP-sensitive K+ channel. A smaller (unitary conductance < 2 pA), short-lived channel with poorly defined openings remains active throughout this experiment. The two right panels (B) show the respective plots of NPo (N = number of KACh channels in the patch; Po = open probability) versus time for events corresponding to muscarinic K+ channels (see “Experimental Procedures”).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Activation of KACh channels in GTP-free solutions has been previously observed under two conditions. One condition involves the application of high (0.25–1 mg/ml) concentrations of trypsin to the internal aspect of excised patches, which induces a gradual increase in muscarinic channel opening in the absence of GTP (15Kirsch G.E. Brown A.M. Am. J. Physiol. 1989; 257: H334-H338Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 16Ito H. Sugimoto T. Kobayashi I. Takahashi K. Katada T. Ui M. Kurachi Y. J. Gen. Physiol. 1991; 98: 517-533Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). Activation of KACh by trypsin presumably is a result of the release of βγ dimers after cleavage of the N terminus of Gα, which is essential for binding to βγ (17Neer E.J. Pulsifer L. Wolf L. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 8996-9000Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Therefore, we initially considered the possibility that a protease associated with atrial membrane patches was responsible for KACh activation in nucleotide-free solution. However, the excision of patches in a bath solution containing a mixture of protease inhibitors (1 μg/ml each of aprotinin, leupeptin, and pepstatin) had no effect on KAChactivation in the absence of nucleotides (Fig. 3; n = 5). Furthermore, KACh channels arising through exposure to nucleotide-free solutions remain open for extended periods of time and are blocked by GDP (see below); in contrast, the open probability of trypsin-activated channels decays markedly with time (15Kirsch G.E. Brown A.M. Am. J. Physiol. 1989; 257: H334-H338Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), and channel activity is not affected by the GDP analog GDPβS after trypsin treatment (16Ito H. Sugimoto T. Kobayashi I. Takahashi K. Katada T. Ui M. Kurachi Y. J. Gen. Physiol. 1991; 98: 517-533Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). These results suggest that membrane-bound proteases are not involved in the activation of KACh in nucleotide-free solutions. Another condition that results in the activation of KACh in the absence of GTP (and agonist) is the perfusion of patches with purified Gβγ subunits (13Logothetis D.E. Kurachi Y. Galper J. Neer E.J. Clapham D.E. Nature. 1987; 325: 321-326Crossref PubMed Scopus (854) Google Scholar, 18Ito H. Tung R.T. Sugimoto T. Kobayashi I. Takahashi K. Katada T. Ui M. Kurachi Y. J. Gen. Physiol. 1992; 99: 961-983Crossref PubMed Scopus (176) Google Scholar), which bind directly to the channel protein (reviewed in Ref. 6Dascal N. Cell. Signalling. 1997; 9: 551-573Crossref PubMed Scopus (265) Google Scholar) and increase the probability of opening, bypassing the GTP-dependent steps of channel activation. By analogy, channel activation in the absence of GTP or agonist might be achieved through the spontaneous liberation of βγ subunits from endogenous G proteins. This hypothesis allows us to make several predictions regarding the behavior of the system. First, if the release of endogenous βγ subunits is the cause of channel activation, the application of exogenous βγ subunits should have different effects on the system, depending on the extent of channel activation. Namely, βγ subunits should increaseNPo when applied during the early stages of each experiment, when channel activation is still underway. However, when the system is allowed to attain maximal activation levels so that endogenous βγ subunits occupy most of the channel sites available, the presence of additional βγ dimers should have little or no effect on channel activity. Fig. 4 A shows that when βγ subunits were applied 8–10 min after patch excision, that is, before full activation was reached, the channel activity (NPo) increases rapidly, by an average of 5.92-fold (±1.61; n = 5). In contrast, the application of βγ subunits to patches 20 min after the patch has been excised (Fig. 4 B) had little or no effect on channel activity, and the ratio of NPo after βγ application toNPo in bath solution was 1.1 ± 0.24 (n = 4). These results indicate that the sites involved in channel activation through exposure to nucleotide-free solutions are identical to the βγ activation sites. Second, Gα-GDP subunits bind βγ dimers with high affinity (19Gilman A.G. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1987; 56: 615-649Crossref PubMed Scopus (4669) Google Scholar) and inhibit their actions through formation of the inactive G protein heterotrimer (reviewed in Ref. 20Hamm H.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 669-672Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (929) Google Scholar). If endogenous βγ subunits are responsible for KACh activation in nucleotide-free solutions, then this process should be blocked by exogenous Gα-GDP. Therefore, we examined the effect of Gαi2-GDP on channels that had reached maximal activation levels in the absence of nucleotides (Fig. 4 C). At 25 nm, Gαi2-GDP decreased NPo to 4.4% (±0.02; n = 4) of the control value, and similar results were obtained at 50 nm (NPo in Gαi2-GDP/NPo control = 0.053 ± 0.09; n = 3), supporting the idea that the opening of muscarinic K+ channels in nucleotide-free solutions involves the liberation of endogenous βγ subunits. Third, the activation of channels through the release of βγ subunits should occur equally well in the presence and absence of Mg2+, because the latter is only required for channel opening when the mechanism involves GTP hydrolysis (5Corey S. Krapivinsky G. Krapivinsky L. Clapham D.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 5271-5278Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar, 18Ito H. Tung R.T. Sugimoto T. Kobayashi I. Takahashi K. Katada T. Ui M. Kurachi Y. J. Gen. Physiol. 1992; 99: 961-983Crossref PubMed Scopus (176) Google Scholar). Indeed, as seen in Fig. 4 D, activation of KACh channels in the absence of nucleotides also took place when Mg2+ was omitted from the bath solution and replaced by 1 mm EDTA (14 of 14 patches). On the other hand, EDTA markedly changed the behavior of ATP-sensitive K+ channels, which remained open for the duration of these experiments (Fig. 4 D). Note that the lack of effect of EDTA on muscarinic K+ channels eliminates a possible contamination of our solutions with AlF4− as a cause for channel activation, because AlF4− does not activate G proteins in the absence of Mg2+ (21Sternweis P.C. Gilman A.G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U S A. 1982; 79: 4888-4891Crossref PubMed Scopus (476) Google Scholar). Finally, in the absence of agonists, GTP induces a basal stimulation of muscarinic K+ channels that results from interactions between unoccupied receptors and Gk (16Ito H. Sugimoto T. Kobayashi I. Takahashi K. Katada T. Ui M. Kurachi Y. J. Gen. Physiol. 1991; 98: 517-533Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar, 22Okabe K. Yatani A. Brown A.M. J. Gen. Physiol. 1991; 97: 1279-1293Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). In contrast, we find no evidence that muscarinic receptors affect the activation of KACh channels in nucleotide-free solutions (Fig. 2), suggesting that under these conditions, receptors cannot couple to G proteins. To verify this conclusion, we examined the effect of ADP ribosylation by PTX on channel activation in the absence of guanine nucleotides. PTX blocks basal- and agonist-stimulated GTP-induced KACh channel opening due to the uncoupling of Gk from muscarinic receptors (16Ito H. Sugimoto T. Kobayashi I. Takahashi K. Katada T. Ui M. Kurachi Y. J. Gen. Physiol. 1991; 98: 517-533Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar, 22Okabe K. Yatani A. Brown A.M. J. Gen. Physiol. 1991; 97: 1279-1293Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar) but should not influence events that result from receptor-independent GDP release and dissociation of heterotrimers. As illustrated in Fig. 5 A, exposure of the inner surface of patches to solutions containing 1 μg/ml PTX and no nucleotides other than 1 mm NAD did not affect spontaneous activation of muscarinic K+ channels (n = 4). This was also true when PTX and NAD were applied 5–10 min after patch excision (data not shown). Likewise, 50 μm N-ethyl maleimide, which affects muscarinic K+channels in a manner similar to that of PTX (14Clark R.B. Nakajima T. Giles W. Kanai K. Momose Y. Szabo G. J. Physiol. (Lond.). 1990; 424: 229-251Crossref Scopus (28) Google Scholar, 16Ito H. Sugimoto T. Kobayashi I. Takahashi K. Katada T. Ui M. Kurachi Y. J. Gen. Physiol. 1991; 98: 517-533Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar), had no effect on channel activation in nucleotide-free solutions (Fig. 5 B;n = 7). Note that in control experiments performed in the presence of 100 μm GTP, both PTX and N-ethyl maleimide abolished channel activity (data not shown). These results are consistent with the hypothesis that activation of muscarinic K+ channels in the absence of GTP happens independently from receptor-G protein coupling. Taken together, the results above support the idea that KACh channels become active in nucleotide-free solutions as a consequence of unstimulated release of βγ subunits from endogenous G proteins. Under normal conditions, the high affinity of βγ subunits for GDP-bound Gα subunits prevents GDP release and dissociation of the G protein heterotrimer. In our experiments, however, nucleotide-free solutions create an environment where the GDP that is gradually released from the G protein cannot be replaced by another nucleotide. This might promote the accumulation of a nucleotide-free form of the G protein akin to the empty form that is a transient intermediate in the GDP-GTP exchange process that induces subunit dissociation and effector activation. In the present case, complete removal of the guanine nucleotide from the medium seems to promote the uncoupling of receptors and G proteins, generating the form Gα(empty)βγ. If this receptor-free form of the empty heterotrimer is unstable, its spontaneous dissociation into Gα(empty) and βγ dimers could fully account for our results. This hypothesis can be tested by examining the effects of nucleotides on channel activity after the system has attained a steady level of activation, because occupation of the empty nucleotide binding site should induce reassociation of the heterotrimer and thus turn off the system. Moreover, if the activation process observed here is indeed G protein mediated, it should display the expected specificity for guanine nucleotides. We applied GDP or GTP to patches where KACh channel openings had reached a steady level after a prolonged perfusion with nucleotide-free solutions. At 2 μm, GDP had a strong inhibitory effect on channel activity (Fig. 6 A). The application of 10 μm GDP reduced the open probability by 93.1% (± 0.04%; n = 6). This is the outcome expected if GDP were to bind specifically to an empty form of Gα, thus promoting its reassociation with βγ. The block by GDP (as well as GTP, Fig. 6 B) took place gradually, indicating that the binding/reassociation process has at least one slow step. In contrast, upon washout of GDP, KACh channels resumed activity at once (Fig. 6 A), indicating that GDP dissociates rapidly from this state of the G protein. The treatment of patches with GTP had dose-dependent effects that were similar to those of GDP (Fig. 6 B), reducing the channel opening probability by 75.4% (±14.1%;n = 4) at 10 μm. In contrast, ATP (100 μm; Fig. 6 C) and UDP (data not shown) did not affect channel activation, attesting to the specificity of the block by guanine nucleotides. The negative effect of GTP is reminiscent of the results obtained when purified G proteins are incubated with GTP: because Gα hydrolyzes GTP at a rate that vastly exceeds the rate of GDP release (19Gilman A.G. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1987; 56: 615-649Crossref PubMed Scopus (4669) Google Scholar), the inactive GDP-bound form of Gα accumulates, despite the presence of the activating trinucleotide. This observation lends further support to the conclusion that nucleotide-free conditions cause the uncoupling of endogenous receptors and G proteins, because otherwise the basal activity of unliganded receptors would have allowed GTP to activate the system (16Ito H. Sugimoto T. Kobayashi I. Takahashi K. Katada T. Ui M. Kurachi Y. J. Gen. Physiol. 1991; 98: 517-533Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar, 22Okabe K. Yatani A. Brown A.M. J. Gen. Physiol. 1991; 97: 1279-1293Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). The sequence of events that follow the initial binding of agonists to muscarinic receptors and eventually lead to muscarinic K+ channel opening has been elucidated using patch clamp methods. Thus, early experiments demonstrated that channel activation by muscarinic agonists requires GTP or its analogs (23Breitwieser G.E. Szabo G. Nature. 1985; 317: 538-540Crossref PubMed Scopus (356) Google Scholar, 24Pfaffinger P.J. Martin J.M. Hunter D.D. Nathanson N.M. Hille B. Nature. 1985; 317: 536-538Crossref PubMed Scopus (593) Google Scholar) as well as Mg2+ (25Kurachi Y. Nakajima T. Sugimoto T. Pfluegers Archiv. 1986; 407: 572-574Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar), implicating a heterotrimeric G protein, Gk, in channel opening. Additionally, the demonstration that pertussis toxin blocks channel activity indicated that Gk belongs to the Gi/o family (13Logothetis D.E. Kurachi Y. Galper J. Neer E.J. Clapham D.E. Nature. 1987; 325: 321-326Crossref PubMed Scopus (854) Google Scholar, 24Pfaffinger P.J. Martin J.M. Hunter D.D. Nathanson N.M. Hille B. Nature. 1985; 317: 536-538Crossref PubMed Scopus (593) Google Scholar). More recently, knockout of both Gαo isoforms has shown that Gk is a member of the Gi group (26Valenzuela D. Han X. Mende U. Fankhauser C. Mashimo H. Huang P. Pfeffer J. Neer E.J. Fishman M.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U S A. 1997; 94: 1727-1732Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar). Therefore, muscarinic K+ channels are customarily described as being activated by muscarinic agonists via a PTX-sensitive, Gi-type G protein through a process that shows an absolute requirement for GTP and Mg2+ (1Wickman K.D. Clapham D.E. Physiol. Rev. 1995; 75: 865-885Crossref PubMed Scopus (341) Google Scholar). Nonetheless, the data described here show that KACh channels can be activated in the absence of agonist, GTP, and Mg2+, and that under this particular set of conditions, the opening of channels is not affected by PTX. At first, this might be taken as evidence for the existence of a novel, G protein-independent pathway that also leads to muscarinic K+ channel activation. However, the observation that GDP, GTP, and Gαi2-GDP terminate channel activation, as well as the time-dependent effect of exogenous Gβγ dimers, suggests that this agonist and GTP-independent pathway still relies on the dissociation of endogenous G proteins and the release of βγ dimers to induce channel opening. The notable difference between the pathway unveiled here and conventional channel activation is that in nucleotide-free conditions the G protein heterotrimer seems to be destabilized not through the binding of GTP, but by the continued absence of bound nucleotide. One important feature of the activation of KACh channels in nucleotide-free solutions is that this condition apparently uncouples the receptor from the G protein. This is reflected in the lack of effect of agonists and antagonists on the activation process and in the lack of effect of PTX and N-ethyl maleimide. Thus, the G protein form generated in our experiments is presumably distinct from the empty state of transducin (Gt) generated in the presence of activated rhodopsin (R*) and in nucleotide-free solutions, which reflects the formation of a tight R*Gtα(empty)βγ complex that does not release βγ dimers (27Chabre M. Deterre P. Eur. J. Biochem. 1989; 179: 255-266Crossref PubMed Scopus (219) Google Scholar). Formation of the latter complex shows an absolute requirement for R*, because, unlike other heterotrimeric G proteins, Gt does not release GDP spontaneously (28Phillips W.J. Cerione R.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 15498-15505Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Note that in vitro studies of the empty form of purified α subunits of Gi and Gs are hindered by the marked instability of the unliganded proteins (29Ferguson K.M. Higashijima T. Smigel M.D. Gilman A.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 7393-7399Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 30Ilrl T. Herzmak P. Nakamoto J.M. Van Dop C. Bourne H.R. Nature. 1994; 371: 164-168Crossref PubMed Scopus (243) Google Scholar). Therefore, to our knowledge, this is the first report on the functional properties of the empty pocket conformation of a G protein generated in the absence of activated receptors. Note that although we assume that the loss of GDP leads to the dissociation of Gαβγ into free α(empty) and βγ dimers, there is an alternative explanation for our observations; namely, in the absence of GTP, Gα-GDP might associate into multimers such as those found in crystals of Gαi1-GDP (31Mixon M.B. Lee E. Coleman D.E. Berghuis A.M. Gilman A.G. Sprang S.R. Science. 1995; 270: 954-960Crossref PubMed Scopus (266) Google Scholar). The formation of these structures is expected to prevent interactions between Gα and receptors, pertussis toxin, or βγ dimers, and it has been hypothesized that polymerization of Gα-GDP might induce nucleotide exchange independently of activated receptors or Gβγ (32Bourne H.R. Science. 1995; 270: 933-934Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar). Finally, our results suggest that the empty state of G protein α subunits bears some resemblance to the GTP-bound conformation, because it seems to have low affinity for the βγ dimer and for receptors. However, this does not imply that this form of Gα is active and could, for example, inhibit adenylyl cyclase as does Gαi-GDP; rather, the activation of channels takes place because Gα(empty) cannot act as a negative regulator of βγ. In summary, our results show that KACh channels can be activated in the absence of agonist, GTP, and Mg2+. We propose that prolonged perfusion of atrial membrane patches with nucleotide-free solution leads to the slow release of GDP from the α-subunit of Gk and the appearance of a form of αk with an unoccupied nucleotide binding site, the empty state. The empty G protein heterotrimer is unstable and undergoes spontaneous dissociation, gradually releasing βγ subunits that can then activate effectors such as the muscarinic K+ channel. Our data imply that this particular empty form of the G protein can arise independent of interactions with receptors. Furthermore, this empty state of G protein α subunits resembles the GTP-bound state, being characterized by low-affinity interactions with the βγ dimer and the receptor. We thank Dr. Stephen Graber for the generous gift of G protein subunits and Dr. Erik L. Hewlett for pertussis toxin."
