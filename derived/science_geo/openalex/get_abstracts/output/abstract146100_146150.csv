https://openalex.org/W2097662881,"At eight European field sites, the impact of loss of plant diversity on primary productivity was simulated by synthesizing grassland communities with different numbers of plant species. Results differed in detail at each location, but there was an overall log-linear reduction of average aboveground biomass with loss of species. For a given number of species, communities with fewer functional groups were less productive. These diversity effects occurred along with differences associated with species composition and geographic location . Niche complementarity and positive species interactions appear to play a role in generating diversity-productivity relationships within sites in addition to sampling from the species pool."
https://openalex.org/W2071648920,"Masses of single-walled carbon nanotubes (SWNTs) with a large mean diameter of about 1.85 nanometers, synthesized by a semicontinuous hydrogen arc discharge method, were employed for hydrogen adsorption experiments in their as-prepared and pretreated states. A hydrogen storage capacity of 4.2 weight percent, or a hydrogen to carbon atom ratio of 0.52, was achieved reproducibly at room temperature under a modestly high pressure (about 10 megapascal) for a SWNT sample of about 500 milligram weight that was soaked in hydrochloric acid and then heat-treated in vacuum. Moreover, 78.3 percent of the adsorbed hydrogen (3.3 weight percent) could be released under ambient pressure at room temperature, while the release of the residual stored hydrogen (0.9 weight percent) required some heating of the sample. Because the SWNTs can be easily produced and show reproducible and modestly high hydrogen uptake at room temperature, they show promise as an effective hydrogen storage material."

The results of cross-fostering studies reported here provide evidence for (i) a causal relationship between maternal behavior and stress reactivity in the offspring and (ii) the transmission of such individual differences in maternal behavior from one generation of females to the next. Moreover, an environmental manipulation imposed during early development that alters maternal behavior can then affect the pattern of transmission in subsequent generations. Taken together, these findings indicate that variations in maternal care can serve as the basis for a nongenomic behavioral transmission of individual differences in stress reactivity across generations."

https://openalex.org/W2083129881,"Diatom cell walls are regarded as a paradigm for controlled production of nanostructured silica, but the mechanisms allowing biosilicification to proceed at ambient temperature at high rates have remained enigmatic. A set of polycationic peptides (called silaffins) isolated from diatom cell walls were shown to generate networks of silica nanospheres within seconds when added to a solution of silicic acid. Silaffins contain covalently modified lysine-lysine elements. The first lysine bears a polyamine consisting of 6 to 11 repeats of the N -methyl-propylamine unit. The second lysine was identified as ɛ - N,N -dimethyl- lysine. These modifications drastically influence the silica-precipitating activity of silaffins."

https://openalex.org/W2057949133,"The Brca1 (breast cancer gene 1) tumor suppressor protein is phosphorylated in response to DNA damage. Results from this study indicate that the checkpoint protein kinase ATM (mutated in ataxia telangiectasia) was required for phosphorylation of Brca1 in response to ionizing radiation. ATM resides in a complex with Brca1 and phosphorylated Brca1 in vivo and in vitro in a region that contains clusters of serine-glutamine residues. Phosphorylation of this domain appears to be functionally important because a mutated Brca1 protein lacking two phosphorylation sites failed to rescue the radiation hypersensitivity of a Brca1-deficient cell line. Thus, phosphorylation of Brca1 by the checkpoint kinase ATM may be critical for proper responses to DNA double-strand breaks and may provide a molecular explanation for the role of ATM in breast cancer."

https://openalex.org/W2000624133,"Hypoxia-inducible factor-1 (HIF-1) controls the expression of a number of genes such as vascular endothelial growth factor and erythropoietin in low oxygen conditions. However, the molecular mechanisms that underlie the activation of the limiting subunit, HIF-1α, are still poorly resolved. Results showing that endogenous HIF-1α migrated 12 kDa higher than in vitrotranslated protein led us to evaluate the possible role of phosphorylation on this phenomenon. We report here that HIF-1α is strongly phosphorylated in vivo and that phosphorylation is responsible for the marked differences in the migration pattern of HIF-1α. In vitro, HIF-1α is phosphorylated by p42 and p44 mitogen-activated protein kinases (MAPKs) and not by p38 MAPK or c-Jun N-terminal kinase. Interestingly, p42/p44 MAPK stoichiometrically phosphorylate HIF-1α in vitro, as judged by a complete upper shift of HIF-1α. More importantly, we demonstrate that activation of the p42/p44 MAPK pathway in quiescent cells induced the phosphorylation and shift of HIF-1α, which was abrogated in presence of the MEK inhibitor, PD 98059. Finally, we found that in a vascular endothelial growth factor promoter mutated at sites previously shown to be MAPK-sensitive (SP1/AP2–88-66 site), p42/p44 MAPK activation is sufficient to promote the transcriptional activity of HIF-1. This interaction between HIF-1α and p42/p44 MAPK suggests a cooperation between hypoxic and growth factor signals that ultimately leads to the increase in HIF-1-mediated gene expression.

Angiogenesis occurs in natural situations such as the female reproductive cycle, or in pathological situations such as wound healing, retinopathy, tumor proliferation, and metastasis. In the latter cases, these events share a common characteristic of occurring in a hypoxic environment. A major mediator of vasculogenesis and angiogenesis is vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF)1 (1Risau W. Nature. 1997; 386: 671-674Crossref PubMed Scopus (4867) Google Scholar, 2Shweiki D.

Induction of VEGF is a multistage process in which the hypoxia-inducible factor 1 (HIF-1) plays a key role in transcriptional activation (10Forsythe J.A. Jiang B.H. Iyer N.V. Agani F. Leung S.W. Koos R.D. Semenza G.L. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 4604-4613Crossref PubMed Scopus (3234) Google Scholar). During hypoxia, HIF-1 is expressed, binds to DNA, and induces the transcription of VEGF mRNA. HIF-1 is composed of two subunits, HIF-1α and HIF-1β (11Wang G.L. Semenza G.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 1230-1237Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1737) Google Scholar). Each subunit contains an N-terminal basic-helix-loop-helix domain. They also contain a PAS motif, which is found in a number of transcription factors including the Drosophila proteins Period, Single-minded, and Trachealess, and mammalian proteins such as the aryl hydrocarbon receptor (AHR) and the aryl hydrocarbon receptor nuclear translocator (ARNT). HIF-1β was identified as being the previously described ARNT protein (11Wang G.L. Semenza G.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 1230-1237Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1737) Google Scholar). The basic domain is responsible for DNA binding, while the helix-loop-helix and PAS domains play a role in heterodimerization (12Wang G.L. Jiang B.H. Rue E.A. Semenza G.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.

However, while HIF-1β is quite stable in normoxic conditions, HIF-1α is extremely unstable (t 1/2< 5 min) and previous studies have shown that, in oxygenated cells, HIF-1α is quickly degraded by the ubiquitin-proteasome system (17Huang L.E.

Recently, three independent laboratories succeeded in the knockout of the mouse HIF-1α gene (HIF-1α−/−) (19Iyer N.V. Kotch L.E. Agani F. Leung S.W. Laughner E. Wenger R.H. Gassmann M. Gearhart J.D.

They also showed that HIF-1α−/− mice were deficient in vascularization and had cardiac and neuronal abnormalities. Tumors formed from HIF-1α−/− ES cells were retarded in growth, and vascularization was absent. These results clearly show the irrevocable role that HIF-1α plays in neovascularization and embryogenesis. A large quantity of information concerning HIF-1α has been published in a very short period. However, molecular signals underlying activation of HIF-1α are still unknown. Very little is known about the post-translational modifications of HIF-1α and, more precisely, the possible role of phosphorylation. In this work, we show that HIF-1α is highly phosphorylated in vivo and that HIF-1α phosphorylation induces strong changes in its electrophoretic migration pattern. We also show that, in vitro, p42/p44 MAPK duplicate this phosphorylation. More interestingly, direct activation of the p42/p44 MAPK pathway in quiescent cells induces the same striking shift in molecular mass. Finally, this activation of p42/p44 MAPK can promote the transcriptional activation of HIF-1. The established Chinese hamster fibroblast cell line CCL39 and their corresponding transfected cells, HA-p44 MAPK, HA-p38 MAPK, and HA-JNK cells, were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (DMEM) containing 7.5% fetal calf serum (FCS), penicillin (50 units/ml), and streptomycin (50 μg/ml) (Life Technologies, Inc.). Mouse embryo fibroblasts were cultured on gelatin-coated culture plates in the same medium as above. Raf-1:ER clonal cell line (clone 19) is a derivative of the CCL39 cell line, which stably expresses a fusion protein between the catalytic domain of Raf-1 and the ligand binding domain of the estrogen receptor (22Samuels M.L. Weber M.J. Bishop J.M. McMahon M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 6241-6252Crossref PubMed Scopus (323) Google Scholar, 23Samuels M.L. McMahon M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 7855-7866Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). This clone allows the exclusive activation of the p42/p44 MAPK pathway upon estradiol treatment, and its characteristics have been previously described (24Lenormand P. McMahon M. Pouyssegur J. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 15762-15768Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). These cells were cultured in the same medium as described above in the absence of phenol red in order to reduce the basal activity of the Raf-1:ER chimera. Human 293, HeLa, and HepG2 cell lines were cultured in DMEM containing 7.5% heat-inactivated FCS. Mouse endothelial 1G11 cells were cultured on gelatin-coated plates in the DMEM medium supplemented with 20% FCS, 100 μg/ml heparin, and 100 μg/ml endothelial cell growth supplement (25Dong Q.G. Bernasconi S. Lostaglio S. De C.R. Martin P.I. Breviario F. Garlanda C. Ramponi S. Mantovani A. Vecchi A. Arterioscler. Thromb. Vasc. Biol. 1997; 17: 1599-1604Crossref PubMed Scopus (209) Google Scholar). Cell growth was arrested by total deprivation of serum for 16–20 h if not otherwise indicated. Hypoxic conditions were obtained placing the cells in a sealed “Bug-Box” anaerobic workstation (Ruskinn Technologies, Leeds, UK/Jouan, Saint Herblain, France). The oxygen in this workstation was maintained at 1–2% with the residual gas mixture being 93–94% nitrogen and 5% carbon dioxide. The hemagglutinin (HA)-tagged HIF-1α and HIF-1β were cloned by reverse transcription-PCR. Briefly, poly(A) RNA was extracted from hypoxic 293 cells with the use of the mRNA isolation kit (Roche Molecular Biochemicals) and reverse transcribed using the Expand reverse transcriptase system (Roche Molecular Biochemicals). HIF-1α and HIF-1β were amplified with the Expand high fidelity PCR system (Roche Molecular Biochemicals) using the primers: sense 5′-ATGGAGGGCGCCGGCGGCGAG-3′ and antisense 5′-GTTAACTTGATCCAAAGCTCTGAG-3′ for HIF-1α and sense 5′-TGGCGGCGACTACTGCCAACCCC-3′ and antisense 5′-TTCTGAAAAGGGGGGAAAC-3′ for HIF-1β. Conditions for PCR amplification were: 35 cycles with 30 s at 95 °C, 1 min at 55 °C, 2.5 min at 72 °C, and a last cycle of elongation at 72 °C for 10 min. Blunt ended fragments were 3′ A-tailed with Taq DNA polymerase, purified, and ligated into the PCR fragment cloning vector pTag (Ingenius; R&D Systems). To construct the HA-tagged forms of HIF-1α and HIF-1β, a new PCR reaction was performed using the p-Tag constructions as templates and the same sense (initiation codons ATG were mutated to GAG) and antisense primers (containing aSmaI and a XbaI restriction site, respectively) previously utilized. The PCR products were digested withSmaI and XbaI and subcloned into the pECE/HA expression vector (26Ellis L. Morgan D.O. Clauser E. Edery M. Jong S.M. Wang L.H. Roth R.A. Rutter W.J. Cold Spring Harbor Symp. Quant. Biol. 1986; 2: 773-784Crossref Google Scholar). Finally, the two tagged forms were subcloned into the pcDNA3 expression vector (Invitrogen). The complete sequence was verified by Eurogentec (Liège, Belgium). The luciferase reporter used in these experiments is a modified version of the original VEGF promoter gene construct that was generously provided by Dr. Werner Risau. Two SP1 and one AP2 binding sites, which have been recently implicated in p42/p44 MAPK-mediated VEGF expression, were point mutated as previously reported (6Milanini J. Vinals F. Pouyssegur J. Pages G. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 18165-18172Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (289) Google Scholar). GST-ATF2 construct was a generous gift from Dr. Roger Davis. Raf-1:ER cells or parental CCL39 cells in 12-well plates (1.5 × 105cells/well) were transiently transfected by CaPO4precipitation. 100 ng/well reporter plasmid were used along with the indicated concentrations of expression vector, 100 ng/well virus β-galactosidase as a control for transfection efficiency and the empty vector, pcDNA3, to normalize the quantity of DNA transfected to a total of 1 μg/well. Four hours after transfection, cells were FCS-starved for 5 h, followed by stimulation for 16 h. Cells were then washed twice with cold PBS, and luciferase assays were performed as follows. Cells were lysed in a lysis buffer (25 mm Tris-phosphate (pH 7.8), 2 mm DTT, 2 mm 1,2-diaminocyclohexane-N,N,N′,N′-tetraacetic acid, 10% glycerol, and 1% Triton X-100) for 15 min at room temperature, and the lysate was cleared by centrifugation. The luciferase assay was performed in a buffer containing 20 mmTricine, 1.07 mm(MgCO3)Mg(OH)2-5H2O (Sigma), 2.67 mm MgSO4, 3.1 mm EDTA, 33.3 mm DTT, 270 μm coenzyme A (Sigma), 470 μm beetle luciferin (Promega), and 530 μmATP. β-Galactosidase activity was evaluated with the use of Galacto-Light chemiluminescent reporter assay kit from Tropix (Bedford, MA). Results were quantified with a MicroBeta TRILUX luminescence counter (Wallac) and expressed as the -fold induction over control cells. Control cells were transfected with the reporter only and underwent the same treatments as cells transfected with HIF-1α and HIF-1β. Anti-HIF-1α antiserum 2087 was raised in rabbits immunized against the last 20 amino acids of the C-terminal end of human HIF-1α. Mouse monoclonal anti-hemagglutinin (HA) antibody 12CA5 was from BabCO (Richmond, CA). Rabbit anti-phospho-p44/p42 MAPK polyclonal antibody was from New England Biolabs and horseradish peroxidase-coupled anti-mouse and anti-rabbit antibody were from Promega. Rabbit p42 MAPK antiserum E1B4 was produced and characterized in our laboratory (48Brondello J.M. Brunet A. Pouysségur J. McKenzie F.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 1368-1376Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (318) Google Scholar). Confluent cells were lysed in a lysis buffer containing 0.1% Triton X-100, 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 100 mm NaCl, 5 mm EDTA, 50 mmsodium fluoride, 40 mm β-glycerophosphate, 200 μm sodium orthovanadate, 5 μg/ml aprotinin, 0.7 μg/ml pepstatin, 0.5 μg/ml leupeptin, and 0.1 mmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride. Protein concentration was determined with the use of a Bio-Rad assay. 50 μg of whole cell extracts were resolved in SDS-polyacrylamide gels (7.5% or 12.5%) and electrophoretically transferred onto a polyvinylidene difluoride membrane (Immobilon-P, Millipore). HA-HIF-1α was immunoprobed with an anti-HA antibody (1:1000) while endogenous HIF-1α was revealed with an anti-HIF-1α antiserum (1:1000). The bands were visualized with the ECL system (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). Bacterially expressed and purified active p42 MAPK was generously provided by Dr. Melanie Cobb (27Khokhlatchev A. Xu S. English J. Wu P. Schaefer E. Cobb M.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 11057-11062Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (177) Google Scholar). HA-tagged p44 MAPK, p38 MAPK, and JNK were obtained by immunoprecipitation from stably expressing cell lines developed in our laboratory (28Brunet A. Pouyssegur J. Science. 1996; 272: 1652-1655Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar). HA-HIF-1α or HA-HIF-1β were translated in vitro using the TNT-coupled reticulocyte lysate system (Promega). For radiolabeled HIF-1α, translation was performed in the presence of 40 μCi of [35S]methionine (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). For unlabeled HIF-1α, translation was performed in the presence of 20 μml-methionine (Sigma). 5 μl of the translation mixture (for each condition) were immunoprecipitated using anti-HA antibody and used as substrate. The kinase assay was performed in a buffer containing 20 mm Hepes, 10 mmMgCl2, 0.5 mm DTT, 5 mm p-nitrophenyl phosphate, 50 μm ATP with or without 2 μCi of [γ-32P]ATP for the desired time at 30 °C. Proteins were then resolved in SDS-polyacrylamide gels (7.5%) and revealed by autoradiography and Western blotting. Endogenous HIF-1α from HeLa cells was used as substrate. HIF-1α was immunoprecipitated using an anti-HIF-1α antiserum and washed three times with the previously mentioned lysis buffer. Immunoprecipitates were then washed twice with the phosphatase buffer supplied by the manufacturer and incubated with λ phosphatase (New England Biolabs) for 1 h at 37 °C. Proteins were resolved in SDS-polyacrylamide gels (7.5%) and revealed by Western blotting. We developed a high affinity anti-HIF-1α antibody that specifically allows us to evaluate HIF-1α expression in vitro and in whole cell extracts. Human HIF-1α, translated in vitro in a rabbit reticulocyte system, migrated in a 7.5% SDS-polyacrylamide gel as a sharp band, which corresponded to a molecular mass of 104 kDa (Fig.1). We then compared the in vitro expressed protein to endogenous HIF-1α from different exponentially growing cell lines. In all the cases tested, HIF-1α was strongly induced by hypoxia. The migration patterns of the endogenous HIF-1α are different between cell lines. However, one common occurrence is noted: induced HIF-1α migrated with a very diffused pattern (104–116 kDa) as compared with the in vitrotranslated protein (Fig. 1). Since very few post-translational modifications can occur in vitro, these results suggested that HIF-1α, expressed in a whole cell system, undergoes strong post-translational modifications. It has often been demonstrated that phosphorylation can markedly modify the migration pattern of proteins in SDS-polyacrylamide gels. Therefore, we wanted to evaluate whether these changes in electrophoretic migration (about 12 kDa) were due to phosphorylation. Endogenous HIF-1α from HeLa cells was dephosphorylated with the use of a nonspecific protein phosphatase, λ phosphatase. As shown in Fig.2, when HeLa cells were incubated in hypoxic conditions and HIF-1α was immunoprecipitated with anti- HIF-1α antibody and revealed with the same antibody, hypoxia strongly induced HIF-1α, which migrated as two distinct bands: the first at 104 kDa and the second at 116 kDa. Incubation of immunoprecipitated HIF-1α with λ phosphatase drastically decreased the molecular mass of HIF-1α to a value that corresponded exactly to in vitrotranslated HIF-1α, i.e. 104 kDa. These results show that HIF-1α is phosphorylated in vivo and that phosphorylation is responsible for increase in HIF-1α's apparent molecular mass. We next wanted to identify a kinase capable of phosphorylating HIF-1α and inducing this 12-kDa shift in molecular mass. Results from our laboratory showed that treatment of CCL39 cells with the potent serine/threonine phosphatase inhibitor okadaic acid led to a clear increase in HIF-1α's molecular mass (data not shown). This suggested that serine/threonine protein phosphatase(s) dephosphorylate(s) HIF-1α and therefore, serine/threonine protein kinase(s) should be responsible for the mobility shift of HIF-1α. p42/44 MAPK are two serine/threonine protein kinases activated by mitogenic stimulation and modulate the activity of a number of transcription factors (for review, see Ref. 29Cobb M.H. Goldsmith E.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 14843-14846Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1663) Google Scholar). Recently, Elk-1 was shown to be phosphorylated during hypoxic conditions by MAPK, inducing the transcription of the c-fos gene (30Muller J.M. Krauss B. Kaltschmidt C. Baeuerle P.A. Rupec R.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 23435-23439Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar). We therefore wanted to evaluate the capacity of p42/p44 MAPK to phosphorylate HIF-1α. HIF-1α was translated in vitro with [35S]methionine and incubated for different periods of time with active p42 MAPK. Surprisingly, incubation of HIF-1α with p42 MAPK induced a rapid shift in the electrophoretic mobility of HIF-1α with a t 1/2 of 5 min and a complete shift of the molecule at 20 min (Fig. 3). The molecular mass of the shifted HIF-1α was strikingly similar to the uppermost band seen for endogenous HIF-1α expressed in human cells, i.e. 116 kDa. As a control, HIF-1β was also translated in vitro and incubated with p42 MAPK. In contrast to HIF-1α, the migration of HIF-1β was not modified by p42 MAPK (Fig. 3). These results suggest that HIF-1α is phosphorylatedin vitro by p42 MAPK and, more importantly, that this phosphorylation is able to reproduce the SDS gel mobility shift observed in vivo. To this point, we have evaluated the phosphorylation of in vitro translated HIF-1α by p42 MAPK. However, we next wanted to examine whether this phosphorylation was reproducible on endogenous HIF-1α expressed in a intact cell system. Therefore, we performed phosphorylation assays with active p42 MAPK on λ phosphatase dephosphorylated HIF-1α from HeLa cells. As previously shown in Fig.2, dephosphorylated HIF-1α was shifted to a lower molecular mass of approximately 104 kDa, which corresponds to the unmodified in vitro translated HIF-1α. After dephosphorylation, HIF-1α was incubated in the presence of p42 MAPK for 20 min at 30 °C. As expected, HIF-1α now migrated at a molecular mass that corresponded to the uppermost band of untreated HIF-1α from HeLa cells (Fig.4). In these conditions, the shift is complete, all of HIF-1α migrating as the higher molecular mass band. This suggests a good stoichiometric phosphorylation of HIF-1α by p42 MAPK, since every molecule is phosphorylated on the site(s) responsible for this shift. The same results can be seen with HIF-1α from other cell types and transiently transfected HA-HIF-1α (data not shown). These results demonstrate that endogenous HIF-1α can be phosphorylated by p42 MAPK. We also show that this phosphorylation can reproduce the maximal SDS gel shift detected for HIF-1α induced in intact cells. The MAPK family of protein kinases includes the mitogen-stimulated p42/p44 MAPK or ERKs and also the stress-activated kinases p38 MAPK and JNK (31Karin M. Ann. N. Y. Acad. Sci. 1998; 851: 139-146Crossref PubMed Scopus (291) Google Scholar). We therefore evaluated the specificity of the p42/p44 MAPK phosphorylation by assessing whether p38 MAPK or JNK could phosphorylate HIF-1α. In this experiment, HA-tagged kinases, stimulated or not, were immunoprecipitated from CCL39 cells stably transfected with the corresponding expression vector and incubated with in vitro translated HIF-1α as substrate. In the case of p44 MAPK, cells were incubated for 5 min with 10% FCS, a condition that gives a maximal activation of p42/p44 MAPK. As for p38 MAPK and JNK, cells were maximally activated by addition of 1 μg/ml anisomycin for 20 min. Incubation of unlabeled HIF-1α with [γ-32P]ATP and activated p44 MAPK strongly phosphorylated HIF-1α (Fig. 5, autoradiography) and induced a marked shift in its molecular mass (Fig.5, Western blot). Neither p38 MAPK or JNK were able to phosphorylate HIF-1α or induce changes in HIF-1α's migration pattern. These results indicate that the phosphorylation of HIF-1α by MAPK is specific to p42/44 MAPK. We now wanted to evaluate if hypoxia could activate p42/p44 MAPK, which would then phosphorylate HIF-1α and induce the molecular mass shift. Hypoxia has been shown to activate p42/p44 MAPK in HeLa cells (30Muller J.M. Krauss B. Kaltschmidt C. Baeuerle P.A. Rupec R.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 23435-23439Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar). The HeLa cell line is a difficult model to evaluate p42/44 MAPK activity, since these cells are highly transformed and have a high basal level of p42/p44 MAPK activity even in FCS-starved conditions (32Berra E. Diaz-Meco M.T. Moscat J. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 10792-10797Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (232) Google Scholar). In contrast, CCL39 cells are an excellent model for studying p42/p44 MAPK activation. When deprived of FCS, CCL39 cells arrest well and show very low levels of p42/p44 MAPK activity. Therefore, we evaluated the effect of hypoxia on p42/p44 MAPK activation in CCL39 cells. Since dual phosphorylation of p42/p44 MAPK is a clear indication of activation (33Payne D.M. Rossomando A.J. Martino P. Erickson A.K. Her J.H. Shabanowitz J. Hunt D.F. Weber M.J. Sturgill T.W. EMBO J. 1991; 10: 885-892Crossref PubMed Scopus (842) Google Scholar, 34Anderson N.G. Maller J.L. Tonks N.K. Sturgill T.W. Nature. 1990; 343: 651-653Crossref PubMed Scopus (797) Google Scholar), we used an anti-phospho-p42/p44 MAPK antibody to evaluate variations in p44/p42 MAPK activity. As seen in Fig. 6, stimulation of quiescent CCL39 cells with 10% FCS (v/v) induced a strong activation of p42 MAPK. However, no active p42 MAPK could be detected after exposure to hypoxia (1% oxygen) for 5–60 min while the levels HIF-1α rapidly and steadily increased under the same conditions. Longer times were also performed (up to 24 h of hypoxia) without any detectable phosphorylation of p42 MAPK (data not shown). p42 MAPK protein levels did not vary during hypoxia. It is important to note that in this model system and with the antibody used, detection of active p44 MAPK is very faint even if p44 MAPK is present in a relatively similar quantity as p42 MAPK (data not shown). These results suggested that p42/p44 MAPKs are not activated by hypoxia. To confirm these results, p42/p44 MAPK activity was also analyzed by a kinase assay. Serum stimulation (10% v/v) induced a strong phosphorylation of MBP (over 10-fold) while hypoxia (from 5 min to 24 h in 1% oxygen) did not significantly increase the phosphorylation of MBP over basal levels (data not shown). Taken together, these results demonstrate that p42/p44 MAPK activity is not increased by hypoxia in growth-arrested CCL39 cells. Therefore, the phosphorylation of HIF-1α by p42/p44 MAPK and the changes in molecular mass induced by this phosphorylation are not those induced by hypoxia. Since hypoxia did not activate p42/p44 MAPKs, the induction of HIF-1α mobility shift should not be apparent in quiescent hypoxic cells and would be induced by an activation of the p42/p44 MAPK pathway. To investigate this possibility, we used a derivative of the CCL39 cell line that stably expresses the chimera Raf-1:ER. This protein is a fusion between the catalytic domain of Raf-1, an upstream activator of the p42/p44 MAPK cascade, and the ligand binding domain of the estradiol receptor. Estradiol stimulation of Raf-1:ER cells leads to a rapid and exclusive p42/p44 MAPK activation. As seen in Fig.7 A, when quiescent CCL39/Raf-1:ER cells are incubated in hypoxic conditions for 3 h, HIF-1α is induced and migrated as a single band at approximately 104 kDa. This demonstrated that the phophorylation inducing HIF-1α's shift in molecular mass does not occur in quiescent cells. When these cells were treated with estradiol for different intervals before the end of the 3-h hypoxic period, a form of HIF-1α appeared at 116 kDa, which corresponded exactly to the molecular mass of HIF-1α phosphorylated in vitro by p42/p44 MAPK. The induction of the HIF-1 shift closely followed the activation of p42/p44 MAPK. Essentially the same results were obtained using another stimulus shown to activate p42/p44 MAPK, 10% FCS (data not shown). Furthermore, this shift was inhibited by treatment of cells with the specific p42/p44 MAPK pathway inhibitor, PD 98059 (Fig. 7 B). However, the mobility shift of HIF-1α after estradiol stimulation was not complete. We suspected that strong phosphatase activity in the nucleus was the cause of the partial HIF-1α phosphorylation and that if we could increase the level of p42/p44 MAPK activity, we could induce a complete shift of HIF-1α. We therefore incubated the cells with a potent tyrosine phosphatase inhibitor, the vanadate-derived compound, bpV(phen) (Calbiochem). Treatment of cells with bpV(phen) alone strongly activated p42/p44 MAPK activity in CCL39 cells (Fig.7 B, pho"

https://openalex.org/W2091204939,"In response to DNA damage, cells activate checkpoint pathways that prevent cell cycle progression. In fission yeast and mammals, mitotic arrest in response to DNA damage requires inhibitory Cdk phosphorylation regulated by Chk1. This study indicates that Chk1 is required for function of the DNA damage checkpoint in Saccharomyces cerevisiae but acts through a distinct mechanism maintaining the abundance of Pds1, an anaphase inhibitor. Unlike other checkpoint mutants, chk1 mutants were only mildly sensitive to DNA damage, indicating that checkpoint functions besides cell cycle arrest influence damage sensitivity. Another kinase, Rad53, was required to both maintain active cyclin-dependent kinase 1, Cdk1(Cdc28), and prevent anaphase entry after checkpoint activation. Evidence suggests that Rad53 exerts its role in checkpoint control through regulation of the Polo kinase Cdc5. These results support a model in which Chk1 and Rad53 function in parallel through Pds1 and Cdc5, respectively, to prevent anaphase entry and mitotic exit after DNA damage. This model provides a possible explanation for the role of Cdc5 in DNA damage checkpoint adaptation."

Then, pools were assayed for activities, and active pools were deconvoluted to identify the source strains.

A green fluorescent protein-beta1 integrin chimera was used to label FAs in living cells. In stationary cells, FAs were highly motile, moving linearly for several plaque lengths toward the cell center. FA motility was independent of cell density and resulted from contraction of associated actin fibers. In migrating cells, FAs were stationary and only moved in the tail. FA motility in stationary cells suggests that cell movement may be regulated by a clutch-like mechanism by which the affinity of integrins to substrate may be altered in response to migratory cues."

The mechanism of Pak activation by these agents remains unclear. We investigated Pak kinase activation in more detail to gain insight into the interplay between the GTPase/sphingosine binding, an intramolecular inhibitory interaction, and autophosphorylation. We present biochemical evidence that an autoinhibitory domain (ID) contained within amino acid residues 67–150 of Pak1 interacts with the carboxyl-terminal kinase domain and that this interaction is regulated in a GTPase-dependent fashion. Cdc42- and sphingosine-stimulated Pak1 activity can be inhibited intrans by recombinant ID peptide, indicating similarities in their mode of activation. However, Pak1, which was autophosphorylated in response to either GTPase or sphingosine, is highly active and is insensitive to inhibition by the ID peptide.

Hormonal or other stimuli are usually necessary to switch a kinase into a catalytically competent state, allowing phosphorylation of substrates to take place. An emerging regulatory theme is that inhibitory mechanisms exist to keep protein kinases in an inactive state (1Taylor S.S. Radzio-Andzelm E. Curr. Opin. Chem. Biol. 1997; 1: 219-226Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar, 2Kemp B.E. Pearson R.B. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1991; 1094: 67-76Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar), and that relief of such inhibition allows activation to occur. Kinases often act autocatalytically to phosphorylate key amino acid residues that relieve autoinhibition and enhance catalytic efficiency. Alternatively, exogenous kinases may also serve this role. However, activation must be reversed in the absence of the stimulus, and dephosphorylation by protein phosphatases is thought to mediate switching the active kinase back to an inactive or basally activated state. p21-activated kinases (Paks)1belong to a growing family of serine/threonine kinases involved in the control of various cellular processes, including the cell cycle, dynamics of the cytoskeleton, apoptosis, and transcription (3Sells M.A. Chernoff J. Trends Cell Biol. 1997; 7: 162-167Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (265) Google Scholar). Pak kinase activity is regulated by members of the Rho family of GTPases, specifically Cdc42 and Rac. These GTPases bind to Pak kinase solely in their active forms, i.e. the GTP-bound state, resulting in stimulation of the kinase activity both in vitro andin vivo. The molecular details of how the GTPases exert their effect on the kinase to induce its activation remain unclear, however. Several lines of evidence suggested that the amino-terminal non-kinase region of Pak, in which the Cdc42/Rac-binding site is located, is crucial for the regulation of kinase activity. It has been shown by several groups that removal of the NH2-terminal portion of Pak by protease digestion leads to activation of the kinase fragment (4Benner G.E. Dennis P.B. Masaracchia R.A. J.

A physiologically relevant example is known for the 62-kDa isoform Pak2, which has been shown to be cleaved and activated by the cysteine protease caspase-3 in response to apoptosis-inducing stimuli (6Lee N.

Biol. 1998; 18: 2153-2163Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) have recently used mutational analysis to characterize a region in the NH2-terminal regulatory domain of Pak adjacent to the p21-binding domain that is important for the inhibition of kinase activity. Using a plasmid injection approach, they showed that cellular effects that depend on Pak kinase activity, including dissolution of actin stress fibers and focal adhesions, can be blocked by coexpression of the autoinhibitory region. Similar conclusions were reached using a genetic analysis ofSchizosaccharomyces pombe Pak1 (10Tu H. Wigler M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 602-611Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). We undertook a biochemical approach to characterize an interaction between the Pak1 kinase domain and the regulatory amino terminus. We localized the interacting site in the NH2 terminus to the same area as the autoinhibitory domain (ID) characterized by Zhao et al.(9Zhao Z.S. Manser E. Chen Z.Q. Chong C. Leung T. Lim L. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 2153-2163Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Our data suggest that the interaction observed is responsible for maintaining the kinase in an inactive state. Cdc42 was able to disrupt the interaction, but only in the GTP-bound active form. Using characterized mutations in Pak1 that abolish GTPase binding or inactivate the inhibitory function, we could show that the p21-binding and autoinhibitory domains are separable but overlapping. Recently, we have demonstrated that sphingosine is an activator of human Pak1in vitro and in vivo (11Bokoch G.M. Reilly A.M. Daniels R.H. King C.C. Olivera A. Spiegel S. Knaus U.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 8137-8144Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (175) Google Scholar), although the activation by the lipid in vivo is controversial (12Lian J.P. Huang R. Robinson D. Badwey J.A. J. Immunol. 1998; 161: 4375-4381PubMed Google Scholar). We observed that, at non-saturating concentrations, sphingosine-induced Pak1 activation was also sensitive to the autoinhibitory peptide, suggesting that the lipid mediates activation of Pak1 via a similar mechanism, i.e. relief of autoinhibition by the NH2-terminal ID domain. We demonstrate that one major phosphorylation event on residue threonine 423 within the COOH-terminal kinase domain renders the kinase activity independent of the autoinhibitory module and simultaneously increases its specific activity. Both Cdc42 and sphingosine act on Pak1 kinase to expose threonine 423, which in turn becomes accessible for cross-phosphorylation. Cell culture medium, fetal bovine serum and supplements were from Life Technologies, Inc. [γ-32P]ATP (specific activity 4500 mCi/mmol) was from ICN, Costa Mesa CA. Plasmids for transfection were purified using the Qiafilter purification system of Qiagen, Chatsworth CA. The T7-tag monoclonal antibody was purchased from Novagen, Madison WI. Thrombin and sphingosine were purchased from Sigma; GTPγS and [35S]GTPγS were from NEN Life Science Products. For polymerase chain reactions, the Expand High Fidelity PCR system from Roche Molecular Biochemicals was used. The PKCβII antibody (originally raised against a subdomain VIII phosphopeptide of the protein kinase C isoform βII, kindly provided by Erica Dutil and Alexandra Newton, University of California, San Diego, CA) was used to detect the threonine 423 phosphorylated subdomain VIII activation loop of Pak1. pGEX-KG/rpak1 (233–544) was kindly provided by Melanie H. Cobb (University of Texas Southwestern Medical Center, Dallas, TX). pCMV6M is a myc tag-containing derivative of pCMV5 and has been described elsewhere (13Sells M.A. Knaus U.G. Bagrodia S. Ambrose D.M. Bokoch G.M. Chernoff J. Curr. Biol. 1997; 7: 202-210Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (579) Google Scholar). All Pak1 variants (human Pak1 wild type, Pak1-(T423E), Pak1-(T423A), Pak1-(H83L,H86L), Pak1-(L107F), Pak1-(K299A) were inserted into pCMV6M and contain a myc epitope at the amino terminus for detection. The threonine to alanine exchange at position 423 in hPak1 was introduced using oligonucleotides (5′-CAGAGCAAACGGAGCgCCATGGTAGGAACCCC-3′ and the complementary oligonucleotide) and the Quikchange Site-directed mutagenesis kit of Stratagene, La Jolla. The NH2-terminal fragments of hpak1 (amino acid 1–234: hpak1-(1–234), aa 67–150: hpak1-(67–150) and mutated derivative H83L,H86L) were subcloned in pET28a (Novagen, Madison). The wild type and H83L,H86L mutation of hpak1-(1–234) were amplified by PCR from the corresponding pCMV6M/hPak1 derivatives using primers pT637 and OP1/234–3′ (5′-CCG GAATTC TTA AGC ATC TGG TGG AGT GGT-3′), cut with BamHI and EcoRI, and inserted into BamHI-EcoRI-cut pET28a. The p21-binding domain (PBD)/ID wild type fragment (amino acid 67–150) was produced by PCR using primers OP1/67–5′ (5′-CGC GGATCC AAG AAA GAG AAA GAG CGG-3′) and OP1/150–3′ (AAG GAA AAA AGC GGC CGC GTCGAC TCA AGC TGA CTT ATC TGT AAA GCT-3′), cut with BamHI and EcoRI, and inserted into pET28a. The PBD/ID fragments containing the H83L,H86L or the L107F mutations were amplified from the corresponding full-length hPak1 cDNA clones and inserted by BamHI andEcoRI restriction into pET28a. To produce H83L and H86L single mutations in the PBD/ID fragment, overlapping PCR was performed using OP1/67–5′ and OP1/150–3′ as outer boundary primers and overlapping primer pairs to introduce the desired mutations (for H83L: forward primer 5′-TCA GAT TTT GAg CtC ACA ATT CAT-3′ and reverse primer 5′-ATG AAT TGT GaG cTC AAA ATC TGA-3′; for H86L: forward primer 5′-GAA CAC ACA Ata Cta GTC GGT TTT-3′ and reverse primer 5′-AAA ACC GAC taG tAT TGT GTG TTC-3′; lowercase letters indicate the introduced base mutations). The COOH-terminal kinase domains of human Pak1 (amino acids 232–545) was amplified by PCR (primers for hpak1-(232–545): 5′-GCGGATCC CCA GAT GCT TTG ACC CGG-3′, 5′-G CCGGTCGAC TTA GTG ATT GTT CTT TG-3′). The hpak1 fragment was cut with BamHI-SalI and inserted into BamHI-SalI-cut pET28a. The GST-rpak1-(233–544) protein was expressed in DH10B cells and purified according to the standard protocol of Amersham Pharmacia Biotech, Uppsala, Sweden (GST gene fusion system, 3rd edition). Buffers for GST-Cdc42 purification contained 1 μm GDP starting from the lysis, excluding the dialysis buffer. The GST moiety was cleaved off the Cdc42 with thrombin at a final concentration of 10 units/ml glutathione beads. Thrombin was removed by incubation withp-aminobenzamidine beads (Sigma) and Cdc42 dialyzed four times against buffer (25 mm Tris/HCl, pH 7.5, 1 mm EDTA, 5 mm MgCl2, 1 mm DTT, 0.1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride). After dialysis, 1 μm GDP was added again and the purified protein was concentrated by ultrafiltration. His-tagged fusion proteins in vector pET28a were expressed in BL21/DE3 (pLysS). The recombinant kinase fragment (hpak1-(232–545)) was purified following the standard batch purification protocol under native conditions (Qiagen QIAexpressionist, March 1997). The histidine-tagged fusion proteins, hpak1-(1–234) and hpak1-(67–150), were purified under denaturing conditions according to the batch purification method by Qiagen. After elution the proteins were dialyzed twice against 2 liters of buffer (50 mm Hepes/NaOH, pH 7.5, 100 mm NaCl, 10 mm MgCl2, 5% glycerol) and stored frozen at −70 °C. Rat Pak1 kinase fragment (amino acids 233–544) fused to glutathione S-transferase (GST-rpak1-(233–544)) and an NH2-terminal His6/T7-tagged fusion of human Pak1 hpak1-(1–235) were purified and used for in vitro binding studies. The rat Pak1 COOH-terminal kinase domain does not differ in amino acid sequence from the human homologue (sequencing of human Pak1 revealed that amino acid 503 in human Pak1 is glutamic acid, codon GAG, and not aspartic acid, codon GAT, as in the GenBank data base sequence). 1–5 μg of GST-rpak1-(233–544) kinase domain was incubated with 1–3 μg of NH2-terminal protein fragments in binding buffer (50 mm Hepes/NaOH, pH 7.5, 100 mm NaCl, 10 mm MgCl2, 1 mm DTT, 1% Nonidet P-40) in a volume of 200–500 μl. To immobilize the GST protein, glutathione-agarose beads equilibrated in binding buffer were added to the reaction and incubated for 30 min to 1 h at 4 °C under constant agitation. Binding reactions were washed four times with 1 ml of binding buffer each. Samples were boiled in SDS-sample buffer and separated on SDS-PAGE gels for immunoblotting or Coomassie staining. In Cdc42 competition experiments, the binding reactions were washed twice with binding buffer to remove unbound hpak1-(1–234) and Cdc42 was added to the complex for 15 min on ice or for 15 min at 30 °C as indicated in the figure legends. The bead fraction was washed again four times with binding buffer and prepared for SDS-PAGE. Cos-1 or HeLa cells were seeded on 10 cm cell culture dishes at 50–70% confluency and transfected using LipofectAMINE (Life Technologies, Inc.) as a transfection agent. 5 μg of plasmid DNA and 15 μl of LipofectAMINE were used per dish, and the transfection protocol was essentially followed according to the manufacturer's guidelines (Life Technologies, Inc.). After 48 h the dishes were washed once with 1× Hanks' buffered saline solution (Life Technologies, Inc.) and lysed in 0.5 ml of lysis buffer (25 mm Tris/HCl, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 0.1 mmEGTA, 1 mm DTT, 10% glycerol, 1% Nonidet P-40, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride). The expression of proteins in the lysates was analyzed by immunoblotting. For precipitations of myc-tagged hPak1, lysates were incubated with equilibrated protein G beads and monoclonal anti-myc antibody (9E10) for at least 3 h or overnight at 4 °C. The bead fraction was washed four times with lysis buffer, stored frozen at −70 °C, or directly used for kinase assays. To use immunoprecipitated hPak1 in kinase assays, the bead fraction was washed twice in kinase buffer. Cdc42 was loaded with GTPγS under the following conditions. 5–20 μg of Cdc42 were incubated in 25 mm Hepes/NaOH, pH 7.5, containing 20 mm EDTA and 1 mm GTPγS for 10 min at 30 °C in a total volume of 25–100 μl. The reaction was stopped by addition of MgCl2 at 100 mm final concentration. Sphingosine was dissolved in 95% ethanol at a concentration of 15 mm and stored at −20 °C. Aliquots were dried under nitrogen gas and dissolved in 25 mm Tris/HCl, pH 7.5, at 3–4 mm concentration. Before addition of sphingosine to the kinase reaction, the lipid solution was sonicated for 30–60 s. Kinase reactions with purified recombinant or immunoprecipitated Pak were performed in kinase buffer (50 mm Hepes/NaOH, pH 7.5, 10 mmMgCl2, 2 mm MnCl2, 0.2 mm DTT) in a volume of 60 μl with 250 μmATP except for the experiment shown in Fig. 1 D, where 50 μm ATP was used. Radiolabeled ATP was used at 10 μCi/reaction. The reactions were incubated for 30 min at 30 °C and stopped by addition of sample buffer. Myelin basic protein (MBP) was used as a substrate at 2–4 μg/reaction. To prephosphorylate Pak prior to a kinase reaction, the protein G-bound hPak1 was incubated with 250 μm unlabeled ATP and an activator (0.5–2 μg of GTPγS-loaded Cdc42 or 0.4 mmsphingosine) for 30 min at 30 °C. The reactions were washed three times with lysis buffer and twice with kinase buffer and directly used in kinase assays as described above. Pak kinases consist of a NH2-terminal regulatory domain and a COOH-terminal kinase domain having many of the conserved features of all known serine/threonine kinases. Several lines of evidence have suggested that the NH2-terminal region down-regulates the enzymatic activity of the COOH-terminal kinase. We tested whether we could detect a physical interaction between these domains that might be responsible for inhibiting Pak kinase activity. As seen in Fig. 1 A, the purified hpak1-(1–234) fragment efficiently complexed with the bead-coupled GST-rpak1-(233–544) COOH-terminal piece containing the entire kinase domain. Binding was specific to the GST-rpak1-(233–544) fusion since the amino terminus was not precipitated with GST alone. Incubating the preformed GST-rpak1-(233–544)/NH2 terminus complex with GTPγS-loaded Cdc42 reduced the amount of the hpak1-(1–234) in the pull-down fraction (Fig. 1 A,lane 4). This reduction was specific for GTPγS-loaded Cdc42, as a GDP-loaded or a non-loaded Cdc42 was not able to compete (Fig. 1 B). Addition of GTPγS-loaded Cdc42 decreased complex formation in a concentration-dependent manner (Fig. 1 C). A hpak1-(1–234) fragment in which the Cdc42-binding site was mutated (H83L,H86L) bound as efficiently as the wild type fragment to the kinase domain (Fig. 1 C, comparelanes 2 and 7). However, in this case the GTPγS-loaded Cdc42 was not able to disrupt the interaction, indicating that binding of the GTPase to the NH2-terminal fragment is required for the observed competitive effect. In vitro kinase assays showed hpak1-(1–234) is capable to inhibit GST-rpak1-(233–544) kinase activity (Fig. 1 D,lanes 3–6). With increasing amounts of the NH2 terminus, autophosphorylation and phosphorylation of myelin basic protein were decreased. However, hpak1-(1–234) itself was a good substrate for GST-rpak1-(233–544) (data not shown) and this, due to competitive substrate phosphorylation, made it difficult to determine the K i value. Cdc42 binds Pak1 in a minimal region consisting of amino acids 75–89 (14Burbelo P.D. Dreschsel D. Hall A. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 29071-29074Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (559) Google Scholar). However, amino acids surrounding this sequence contribute to the efficiency of the interaction (9Zhao Z.S. Manser E. Chen Z.Q. Chong C. Leung T. Lim L. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 2153-2163Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). We hypothesized, based on the Cdc42 competition experiments (Fig. 1), that the domain interacting with the kinase core might be in close vicinity or overlap with the Cdc42 binding site. To localize the carboxyl-terminal interacting and autoinhibitory domain in the NH2 terminus, we expressed smaller regions of human Pak1 as recombinant His6/T7-tagged proteins in Escherichia coli and tested these in pull-down assays with GST-rpak1-(233–544) immobilized on glutathione-agarose. We detected a very efficient interaction with a His6/T7-tagged fusion of the wild type hpak1-(67–150) peptide (Fig.2 A, lane 4). The amino-terminal fragment did not bind to the GST protein (Fig. 2 A, lane 3), demonstrating the specificity of this interaction. Other amino-terminal Pak fragments (amino acids 1–74 and 174–306) were not pulled down by the COOH-terminal fragment (data not shown). The region encompassing amino acids 67–150 contains the previously characterized GTPase/p21-binding domain and confirmed our hypothesis that the interaction site is in close proximity to the p21 binding domain. To further refine the interacting region, we constructed smaller peptides of hPak1 (aa 67–89, 67–108, and 109–150). However, we could not detect an interaction of these peptides with the Pak1 kinase domain using the pull-down assay (data not shown). We employed already characterized mutations within hpak1-(67–150) to further analyze the function of this region. Mutation of both conserved histidine residues to leucine (H83L,H86L) has been shown to disrupt the interaction with small GTPases, accompanied by a moderate increase in kinase activity (13Sells M.A. Knaus U.G. Bagrodia S. Ambrose D.M. Bokoch G.M. Chernoff J. Curr. Biol. 1997; 7: 202-210Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (579) Google Scholar, 15Daniels R.H. Zenke F.T. Bokoch G.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 6047-6050Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar). Mutating leucine 107 to phenylalanine, on the other hand, leads to strong activation of full-length Pak1, and activity is independent of GTPases (16Brown J.L. Stowers L. Baer M. Trejo J. Coughlin S. Chant J. Curr. Biol. 1996; 6: 598-605Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (228) Google Scholar), even though binding is maintained. We analyzed how these mutations influence the interaction with the GST-rpak1-(233–544) fusion. As seen in Fig. 2 A(lanes 5–12), the H83L and H86L single and double mutants bound as efficiently to the kinase domain as did the wild type peptide. In contrast, the L107F mutation exhibited drastically reduced binding to the kinase domain. The purified hpak1-(67–150) fragments had different abilities to inhibit GST-rpak1-(233–544) kinase (Fig. 2 B). The wild type hpak1-(67–150) was most potent in inhibiting kinase activity, whereas the L107F mutated peptide was strongly reduced in its inhibitory potency, and the H83L,H86L double mutant was moderately reduced in inhibiting GST-rpak1-(233–544) kinase activity. The hpak1-(67–150) fragments, unlike hpak1-(1–234), were not phosphorylated substantially. We termed the hpak1-(67–150) region PBD/ID (p21 bindingdomain/inhibitory domain). Using GST- rpak1-(233–544) kinase to evaluate the inhibitory potential of the PBD/ID region (aa 67–150) had the advantage that the isolated COOH terminus is constitutively active, independently of GTPases. However, we asked whether Cdc42-stimulated hPak1 activity could also be inhibited by the purified peptides. Since a functional p21 binding site is contained within the PBD/ID fragment, it was expected that inhibition of kinase activity could in part be due to sequestering of the GTPases. The ability of the PBD/ID fragments to bind activated Cdc42 was tested (Fig. 3). Only the wild type fragment and the L107F mutated form could bind Cdc42 in overlay assays, although the latter bound with somewhat reduced affinity (about 50% of wild type). Mutation of histidines 83 and 86 either separately or together led to a complete loss of binding to Cdc42. Any kinase inhibition by these Cdc42 binding-deficient fragments would therefore not be due to titration of GTPases. We were able to show that not only the Cdc42-binding proficient, but also the binding-deficient versions were able to inhibit full-length hPak1 activity. As Fig. 4 Ashows, both autophosphorylation and substrate phosphorylation are reduced by hpak1-(67–150) peptides. The wild type and L107F mutant peptides strongly reduce kinase activity. The inhibition by the L107F peptide is most likely due to sequestration of the activated Cdc42. Of the GTPase binding-deficient versions, the H83L mutant peptide was most potent in its kinase-inhibitory effect. Mutation of position 86 significantly reduced the inhibitory effect to a similar extent as did the H83L,H86L double mutant. All peptides showed concentration-dependent inhibitory effects. We titrated the H83L peptide to determine the half-maximal inhibitory concentration using a constant amount of immunoprecipitated hPak1 stimulated with Cdc42 (Fig. 4 B). The purified peptides were not significantly phosphorylated and therefore did not interfere with theK i determination. We calculated the apparentK i as 1.2 μm for MBP phosphorylation (Fig. 4 C). Overall, the peptide inhibition data obtained with p21-activated Pak1 fit well with those using GST-rpak1-(233–544) (Fig. 2 C). Taken together, these data demonstrate that the functional domains for p21 binding and autoinhibition of kinase activity overlap in part within the PBD/ID. Both activities can, however, be separated from each other, demonstrating that the PBD and the ID have distinct structural determinants for function. Pak kinases autosphosphorylate after stimulation with activated Cdc42 and remain activated after removal of the GTPase (17Martin G.A. Bollag G. McCormick F. Abo A. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 1970-1978Crossref PubMed Scopus (305) Google Scholar). In light of our above results, this could indicate that phosphorylation events antagonize the inhibitory effect of the ID domain by decreasing its interaction with the kinase domain. Full-length hPak1 was activated by autophosphorylation for 30 min in the presence of excess unlabeled ATP and Cdc42-GTPγS; these were then removed by washing (Fig.5 A). As shown inlanes 3–7, in a subsequent kinase reaction with labeled ATP the incorporation of label into hPak1 was drastically decreased due to an efficient incorporation of unlabeled ATP in the initial reaction. Autophosphorylated hPak1 was highly active toward substrate even without further addition of activated Cdc42. The hpak1-(67–150) wild type peptide and also the mutated versions (data not shown) did not affect substrate phosphorylation activity of the autophosphorylated Pak1 at levels sufficient to efficiently block Cdc42-stimulated hPak1. Addition of activated GTPase to prephosphorylated hPak1 did not restore the sensitivity toward ID-mediated inhibition (data not shown). We also observed that the hPak1 kinase domain (aa 232–545), when expressed as a His6/T7-tagged fusion protein in E. coli, is autophosphorylated and also not inhibited by excess concentrations of PBD/ID peptide (data not shown), supporting the idea that phosphorylation renders the kinase domain independent of autoinhibition. Interestingly, a hPak1 mutant, hPak1-(T423E) (13Sells M.A. Knaus U.G. Bagrodia S. Ambrose D.M. Bokoch G.M. Chernoff J. Curr. Biol. 1997; 7: 202-210Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (579) Google Scholar), which is constitutively activated by mutation at phospho-acceptor site threonine 423 in the activation loop, is also completely inert toward inhibition by the PBD/ID fragments (Fig. 5 B). In this case, both autophosphorylation and substrate phosphorylation are not affected by the hpak1-(67–150) peptide. This argues that the phosphorylation state of threonine 423 is a critical determinant for kinase inhibition by the ID domain. As indicated by the threonine 423 to glutamic acid mutation in hPak1, the phosphorylation status of the activation loop appears to be of importance for the autoinhibitory mechanism. To analyze this in more detail, we constructed a threonine 423 to alanine mutant that does not autophosphorylate at this residue, and the activity of this mutant was compared with the wild type protein inin vitro kinase assays. Basal activities of immunoprecipitated T423A hPak1 did not differ from wild type (Fig. 6, lanes 1 and 6). The Cdc42-stimulated hPak1 T423A had a decreased activity toward exogenous substrate, ranging from 10 to 30% of wild type activity (Fig. 6, compare lanes 2and 7). Autophosphorylation was less affected and in the range of 40–60% of wild type Pak1. The Cdc42-stimulated hPak1-(T423A) activity was sensitive to inhibition by the H83L hpak1-(67–150) fragment. Prephosphorylation of hPak1-(T423A) in the presence of GTPγS-loaded Cdc42 and excess cold ATP led to a significant decrease in the incorporation of radioactivity into the protein in a subsequent kinase reaction. The prephosphorylated hPak1-(T423A) retained its (reduced) activity toward substrate but surprisingly this activity was still sensitive toward addition of hpak1-(67–150) fragment (Fig. 6,lane 10). It was of interest to analyze if lipid-mediated activation of hPak1 is sensitive to the ID/kinase domain interaction. Sphingosine, which is one of the more effective lipids to activate hPak1 (11Bokoch G.M. Reilly A.M. Daniels R.H. King C.C. Olivera A. Spiegel S. Knaus U.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 8137-8144Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (175) Google Scholar), was used in in vitro kinase assays in the absence and presence of the PBD/ID peptide (Fig.7). The concentration (400 μm) used in the assay resulted in a highly activated hPak1 in which auto- and substrate phosphorylation was comparable to the Cdc42-stimulated enzyme (Fig. 7 A). Under these conditions, sphingosine-mediated activation was completely insensitive to the wild type PBD/ID fragment. However, we observed that activat"

However, themyc family genes are also implicated in the regulation of apoptosis, and both the mitogenic and proapoptotic properties of Myc are functionally inseparable (2Evan G. Littlewood T.

Extracellular stresses, including genotoxic stress stimuli, often activate the c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK)1/p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) pathway (14Nishida E. Gotoh Y. Trends.

In the present study, we investigated whether there is a direct link between JNK pathway and the functional regulation of Myc through phosphorylation. We found that JNK directly phosphorylated c-Myc at Ser-62 and Ser-71, which affects the apoptosis-promoting activities of c-Myc. Therefore, our findings suggest a selective and direct role for JNK as a signal mediator of stress stimuli to c-Myc in apoptosis. pc3GF vector was constructed as follows.

JNK1 and ERK2 were immunoprecipitated from the cell extracts (1.6 mg of protein) by using 10 μg of anti-JNK1 and anti-ERK2 antibodies bound with protein-G4FF-Sepharose beads. Immunocomplexes were resolved on 11% SDS-polyacrylamide gels polymerized with GST-c-Jun (100 μg/ml) or GST-c-Myc (1–262) (100 μg/ml).

Finally, the gel was washed with 5% trichloroacetic acid and 1% sodium pyrophosphate at room temperature several times and then overnight at 4 °C before being dried. Kinase activities were analyzed with a BAS2000 bio-image analyzer (Fujix, Tokyo). For the in vitro kinase assay, 5 μg of each recombinant substrate was incubated with 100 ng of GST-JNK1β1 in Buffer K (25 mm Hepes-KOH, pH 7.6, 20 mm MgCl2, 20 mmβ-glycerophosphate, 20 mm p-nitrophenyl phosphate, 1 mm Na3VO4, 2 mm DTT, 20 μm ATP, 100 μCi/ml [γ-32P]ATP) at 30 °C for 30 min, and the reaction was stopped by adding 2× Laemlli buffer. Phosphorylated proteins were resolved by SDS-PAGE, stained with Coomassie Blue, and analyzed. For the immunocomplex kinase assay, JNK was immunoprecipitated as above, and the immunocomplex was washed with WCE buffer (1 ml, three times) followed by Buffer K without [γ-32P]ATP (1 ml, one time). The kinase reaction proceeded as described above with GST-c-Jun (1–92) as a substrate. To generate anti-phospho-c-Myc (Ser-71) polyclonal antibody (α-P-Ser-71), a synthetic phospho-peptide (RSGLC(phospho-S)PSYVA) corresponding to amino acids 66–76 in the human c-Myc protein was used as an antigen. After five immunizations in Japanese White rabbits, serum was prepared, and α-P-Ser71 was purified on peptide-affinity columns. For the detection of phosphorylated c-Myc of Ser-71 in vivo, 293T cells were transfected with pc3GFhcmyc. Two days after transfection, cells were suspended in cytosol buffer (0.2% Nonidet P-40, 20 mmTris-HCl, pH 7.6, 137 mm NaCl, 10 mm NaF, 20 mm β-glycerophosphate, 1 mmNa3VO4, 2 mm MgCl2, 1 mm PMSF, 1 mm DTT) and the particle nuclear pellet was lysed with particle buffer (1% Nonidet P-40, 0.5% SDS, 0.5% sodium deoxycholate, 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.6, 137 mm NaCl, 10 mm NaF, 20 mmβ-glycerophosphate, 1 mm Na3VO4, 1 mm PMSF, 1 mm DTT) by sonication. Equal amounts of nuclear protein (32 μg) were resolved by SDS-PAGE and transferred to filters. Filters were blocked with 5% lowfat milk, Tris-buffered saline, 0.1% Tween-20 at room temperature, and phosphorylation of Thr-58/Ser-62 or Ser-71 of c-Myc was detected using anti-phospho-c-Myc (Thr-58/Ser-62) antibody (α-P-Thr-58/Ser-62) and α-P-Ser-71. First antibodies diluted with 3% bovine serum albumin, Tris-buffered saline were used for an overnight incubation at 4 °C, and after hybridization with secondary antibodies conjugated with horseradish peroxidase, signals were detected with ECL detection reagent (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). For the pull-down assay, in vitro transcribed and translated35S-Met-labeled JNK1β1 and GST protein (30 μg)/glutathione-Sepharose beads were mixed in a dilution buffer (20 mm Hepes-KOH, pH 7.6, 20 mm MgCl2, 0.5 mm EGTA, 2 mm DTT, 0.1 mm PMSF) and rotated at 4 °C for 2 h. Beads were washed with binding buffer (20 mm Hepes-KOH, pH 7.6, 50 mm NaCl, 2.5 mm MgCl2, 0.05% Triton X-100, 1 mm DTT, 1 mm PMSF) (1 ml, five times), and bound proteins were resolved by 12% SDS-PAGE. The binding proteins were analyzed with a BAS2000 bio-image analyzer. For the detection of an in vivo association between JNK1 and c-Myc, 293T cells (3 × 106 cells) were transfected with pflag-hcmyc (10 μg) using SuperFect reagents (Qiagen GmbH, Hilden, Germany). Two days after transfection, cells were either irradiated with UVC (300 J/m2) or left unirradiated. After a further 30 min of incubation in the presence of chemical cross-linker dithiobis(succinimidylpropionate) (Pierce) (1.5 mg/ml), cells were lysed in Buffer S (20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.6, 137 mm NaCl, 1% Nonidet P-40, 0.5% sodium deoxycholate, 0.1% SDS, 1 mm PMSF) following brief sonication. Immunoprecipitated complex from equal amounts of each cell lysate (1.6 mg) was extensively washed with Buffer S (1 ml, five times) and subjected to 10% SDS-PAGE, and flag-tagged c-Myc was detected by Western blot analysis using anti-Flag M5 antibody. To detect the c-Myc and mutated Myc proteins, cells were lysed in the Buffer S and cleared lysates were obtained by centrifugation. Equal amounts of protein were resolved by 10% SDS-PAGE following transfer to nitrocellulose membrane. Filters were blocked in 5% lowfat milk, PBS, 0.1% Tween 20 and hybridized with first antibodies, such as anti-c-Myc monoclonal antibody 9E10 (Calbiochem-Novabiochem). For the detection of JNK and ERK, cells after treatment were once washed with PBS and frozen with liquid nitrogen. Cells were lysed in 1× Laemlli sample buffer or Buffer S containing phosphatase inhibitors (20 mm NaF, 1 mm Na3VO4, 20 mm β-glycerophosphate), heat-denatured, and sonicated. Equal amounts of protein were resolved by 12% SDS-PAGE, transferred, and hybridized with a first antibody, such as anti-phospho-JNK (G-7) or anti-phospho-ERK (E-4), diluted with 3% bovine serum albumin/Tris-buffered saline, or anti-JNK1(C-17) and anti-ERK2 (C-14) diluted with 5% lowfat milk, PBS, 0.1% Tween 20. After hybridization with secondary antibodies conjugated with horseradish peroxidase, immunocomplex was detected with the ECL detection reagent. Human cervical carcinoma HeLa cells, mouse fibroblast NIH3T3 cells, and human embryonic kidney transformed 293T cells were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (Nissui, Tokyo, Japan) supplemented with 10% heat-inactivated fetal bovine serum (FBS) (Cytosystems, Castle Hill, Australia). To establish human c-myc-transfected NIH3T3 clones, cells were cotransfected using pcDNA3 with each myc-expressing pSP271 plasmid (pSPhcmyc and pSPhcmyc(S62A/S71A)). Transfected cells were cultured in the presence of G418 (200 μg/ml) for 2 weeks and cloned. Deregulated expression of exogenous human c-myc gene products was confirmed by both Northern and Western blot analysis. To isolate JNK(APF)-expressing HeLa cells, pCR3JNK1β1(APF) was transfected into HeLa cells, and transfected cells were cultured with G418 (400 μg/ml) for 2 weeks. After screening jnk1(APF) expression, a HeLa/APF cell clone was established. For transient apoptosis assay of HeLa cells, HeLa (4 × 105 cells/60-mm dish) cells were transfected with plasmid using SuperFect reagents. At 40 h posttransfection, cells were either irradiated by UVC (100 J/m2) or not and then incubated for 4 h in the original medium containing 10% FBS. Next, the cells were fixed with 1% formaldehyde-PBS for 1 min, and the EGFP-positive cells were examined for normal or apoptotic morphology under a fluorescence microscope as described (6Sugiyama A. Noguchi K. Kitanaka C. Katou N. Tashiro F. Ono T. Yoshida M.C. Kuchino Y. Gene. 1999; 226: 273-283Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). Apoptosis was also determined by trypan blue dye exclusion assay. We assumed that some molecules might directly mediate stress signals to Myc, and modulate the functions of Myc. Our preliminary experiments suggested that 42–55-kDa protein kinase(s) could be activated by UVC and phosphorylate c-Myc detected by in-gel kinase assay. 2K. Noguchi, unpublished observation. UV irradiation is known to activate the JNK and p38 MAPK pathway, and the molecular masses of these MAPK family proteins are around 42–55 kDa. As reported before, UV irradiation activates JNK and a mitogenic MAPK protein, ERK2 pathway in HeLa cells (17Derijard B. Hibi M. Wu I.H. Barrett T. Su B. Deng T. Karin M. Davis R.J. Cell. 1994; 76: 1025-1037Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2941) Google Scholar), and ERK2 phosphorylates c-Myc at Ser-62 (31Alvarez E. Northwood I.C. Gonzalez F.A. Latour D.A. Seth A. Abate C. Curran T. Davis R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 15277-15285Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Furthermore, the JNK pathway contributes to the apoptosis induction (21Xia Z. Dickens M. Raingeaud J. Davis R.J. Greenberg M.E. Science. 1995; 270: 1326-1331Crossref PubMed Scopus (5019) Google Scholar, 22Seimiya H. Mashima T. Toho M. Tsuruo T. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 4631-4636Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (215) Google Scholar). Then, we examined whether JNK could phosphorylate c-Myc, as does ERK2. JNK and ERK2 were immunoprecipitated from control and UV-irradiated HeLa cell lysates, and immunocomplex was subjected to in-gel kinase assay with GST-c-Myc (1–262) as a substrate (Fig.1 A). We found that not only ERK2 but also activated JNK phosphorylated c-Myc, and surprisingly, phosphorylation of c-Myc by activated JNK was likely to be stronger than that by activated ERK2 in HeLa cell lysate (Fig. 1 A, right). ERK2 was activated about 2-fold by UV irradiation when GST-c-Myc was used as a substrate, but JNK was activated about 50-fold when GST-c-Jun (1–92) was used as a positive control substrate (Fig.1 A, left). These observations suggest that the total kinase activities of both JNK and ERK2 will affect the phosphorylation status and the function of c-Myc protein, regardless of differences in the total amount and in the substrate specificity of JNK and ERK2. Next, we examined the phosphorylation of several c-Myc substrates by JNK (Fig. 1 B). In vitro kinase assay by GST-JNK1 demonstrated that JNK1 phosphorylated GST-c-Myc (1–139), (1–181), and (1–262), but less GST-c-Myc (1–66) and little GST-c-Myc (1Henriksson M. Luscher B. Adv.

https://openalex.org/W1980155359,"The Caenorhabditis elegans heterochronic genes control the relative timing and sequence of many events during postembryonic development, including the terminal differentiation of the lateral hypodermis, which occurs during the final (fourth) molt. Inactivation of the heterochronic gene lin-42 causes hypodermal terminal differentiation to occur precociously, during the third molt. LIN-42 most closely resembles the Period family of proteins from Drosophila and other organisms, proteins that function in another type of biological timing mechanism: the timing of circadian rhythms. Per mRNA levels oscillate with an approximately 24-hour periodicity. lin-42 mRNA levels also oscillate, but with a faster rhythm; the oscillation occurs relative to the approximately 6-hour molting cycles of postembryonic development."

https://openalex.org/W2099347903,"Chlorofluorocarbon-11 inventories for the deep Southern Ocean appear to confirm physical oceanographic and geochemical studies in the Southern Ocean, which suggest that no more than 5 x 10(6) cubic meters per second of ventilated deep water is currently being produced. This result conflicts with conclusions based on the distributions of the carbon-14/carbon ratio and a quasi-conservative property, PO(4)(*), in the deep sea, which seem to require an average of about 15 x 10(6) cubic meters per second of Southern Ocean deep ventilation over about the past 800 years. A major reduction in Southern Ocean deep water production during the 20th century (from high rates during the Little Ice Age) may explain this apparent discordance. If this is true, a seesawing of deep water production between the northern Atlantic and Southern oceans may lie at the heart of the 1500-year ice-rafting cycle."

https://openalex.org/W2117815723,Glutamatergic neurotransmission is controlled by presynaptic metabotropic glutamate receptors (mGluRs). A subdomain in the intracellular carboxyl-terminal tail of group III mGluRs binds calmodulin and heterotrimeric guanosine triphosphate-binding protein (G protein) betagamma subunits in a mutually exclusive manner. Mutations interfering with calmodulin binding and calmodulin antagonists inhibit G protein-mediated modulation of ionic currents by mGluR 7. Calmodulin antagonists also prevent inhibition of excitatory neurotransmission via presynaptic mGluRs. These results reveal a novel mechanism of presynaptic modulation in which Ca(2+)-calmodulin is required to release G protein betagamma subunits from the C-tail of group III mGluRs in order to mediate glutamatergic autoinhibition.
https://openalex.org/W2068386374,"We investigated a possible role of reactive oxygen species (ROS) in p70S6k activation, which plays an important role in the progression of cells from G0/G1 to S phase of the cell cycle by translational up-regulation of a family of mRNA transcripts that encode for components of the protein synthetic machinery. Treatment of mouse epidermal cell JB6 with H2O2 generated extracellularly by glucose/glucose oxidase led to the activation of p70S6k and p90Rsk and to phosphorylation of p42MAPK/p44MAPK. The activation of p70S6k and p90Rsk was dose-dependent and transient, maximal activities being in extracts treated for 15 and 30 min, respectively. Further characterization of ROS-induced activation of p70S6kusing specific inhibitors for p70S6k signaling pathway, rapamycin, and wortmannin revealed that ROS acted upstream of the rapamycin-sensitive component FRAP/RAFT and wortmannin-sensitive component phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase, because both inhibitors caused the inhibition of ROS-induced p70S6k activity. In addition, Ca2+ chelation also inhibited ROS-induced activation of p70S6k, indicating that Ca2+ is a mediator of p70S6k activation by ROS. However, down-regulation of 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate (TPA)-responsive protein kinase C (PKC) by chronic pretreatment with TPA or a specific PKC inhibitor Ro-31-8220 did not block the activation of p70S6kby ROS, indicating that the activation of TPA-responsive PKC was not required for stimulation of p70S6k activity by H2O2 in JB6 cells. Exposure of JB6 cells to platelet-derived growth factor or epidermal growth factor led to a rapid increase in H2O2, phosphorylation, and activation of p70S6k, which were antagonized by the pretreatment of catalase.

Ray L.B. Erikson E. Maller J.L. Nature. 1988; 334: 715-718Crossref PubMed Scopus (754) Google Scholar). The other family consists of two enzymes termed p70S6k and p85S6k (4Banerjee P. Ahmad M.F.

Thomas G. Semin. Cancer Biol. 1994; 5: 255-260PubMed Google Scholar, 7Ferrari S. Thomas G. CRC Crit. Rev. Biochem. Mol. Biol. 1994; 29: 385-413Crossref PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar). Unlike p90Rsk, p70S6k and p85S6k have been shown to reside on a novel p21Ras-independent mitogenic signaling pathway (8Ballou L.M. Luther H. Thomas G. Nature. 1991; 349: 348-350Crossref PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar, 9Ming X.F. Burgering B.M.T. Wennstrom S. Claesson-Welsh L. Heldin C.H. Bos J.L. Kozma S.C. Thomas G. Nature. 1994; 371: 426-429Crossref PubMed Scopus (204) Google Scholar) that bifurcates at the level of the receptor from the p21Ras pathway (9Ming X.F. Burgering B.M.T. Wennstrom S. Claesson-Welsh L.

Nature. 1994; 370: 71-75Crossref PubMed Scopus (657) Google Scholar). The p70S6k is cytoplasmic, whereas the amino-terminal extension of p85S6k targets it to the nucleus (11Reinhard C. Fernandez A. Lamb N.J.C. Thomas G. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 1557-1565Crossref PubMed Scopus (179) Google Scholar). The major substrate of the kinase in both compartments of the cell appears to be the 40 S ribosomal protein S6 (12Stewart M.J. Thomas G. BioEssay. 1994; 16: 1-7Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar), whose multiple phosphorylation in the cytosol has been implicated in the selective translational up-regulation of a family of mRNA transcripts that contain polypyrimidine tract at their 5′ transcriptional start site (13Jefferies H.B.J.

Consistent with this finding, inhibition of p70S6k activation by microinjection of neutralizing antibodies into cells (15Lane H.A. Fernandez A. Lamb N.J.C. Thomas G. Nature. 1993; 363: 170-172Crossref PubMed Scopus (318) Google Scholar) or by treatment of cells with the inhibitors of p70S6k, the immunosuppressant rapamycin (16Chung J. Kuo C.J. Crabtree G.R.

Science. 1992; 257: 973-977Crossref PubMed Scopus (589) Google Scholar), severely impedes cell cycle progression. Although p70S6k is activated by numerous stimuli, including growth factors, cytokines, phorbolesters, oncogenic products, Ca2+, inhibitors of protein synthesis (7Ferrari S. Thomas G. CRC Crit. Rev. Biochem. Mol. Biol. 1994; 29: 385-413Crossref PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar, 19Chou M.M. Blenis J. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1995; 7: 806-814Crossref PubMed Scopus (245) Google Scholar), and hormones such as angiotensin II (20Graves L.M. He Y. Lambert J. Hunter D. Li X. Earp H.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 1920-1928Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar), the signal transduction pathway that mediates p70S6k is poorly understood. This pathway bifurcates at a growth factor receptor docking site that is distinct from that of the p21Ras/MAPK pathway (9Ming X.F. Burgering B.M.T. Wennstrom S. Claesson-Welsh L. Heldin C.H. Bos J.L. Kozma S.C. Thomas G. Nature. 1994; 371: 426-429Crossref PubMed Scopus (204) Google Scholar). Many studies, including point mutational analysis of platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF) receptor (10Chung J. Grammer T. Lemon K.P. Kazlauskas A. Blenis J. Nature. 1994; 370: 71-75Crossref PubMed Scopus (657) Google Scholar), and the effect of various mutants of phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K) (21Weng Q.P. Andrabi K. Klippel A. Kozlowski M.T. Williams L.T. Avruch J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 5744-5748Crossref PubMed Scopus (202) Google Scholar) and specific inhibitor wortmannin for PI3K on p70S6k activity (10Chung J.

Biol. 1994; 14: 4902-4911Crossref PubMed Scopus (1001) Google Scholar), have suggested that PI3K is an upstream mediator of p70S6k activity. Recent studies favor a model in which protein kinase B lies below PI3K and upstream of p70S6k (23Downward J. Nature. 1995; 376: 553-554Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar, 24Kitamura T. Ogawa W. Sakaue H. Hino Y. Kuroda S. Takata M. Matsumoto M. Maeda T. Konishi H. Kikkawa U. Kasuga M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 3708-3717Crossref PubMed Scopus (296) Google Scholar), although its function as a regulator for p70S6k signaling pathway has been challenged (25Andjelkovic M. Jakubowicz T. Cron P. Ming X.-F. Han J.W. Hemmings B.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 5699-5704Crossref PubMed Scopus (430) Google Scholar, 26Conus N.M. Hemmings B.A. Pearson R.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 4776-4782Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar). Protein kinase B is activated through a wortmannin-sensitive phosphorylation. Recently, the kinase responsible for phosphorylation has been characterized and has been designated phosphoinositide-dependent protein kinase PDK1 (27Pullen N. Dennis P.B. Andjelkovic M. Dufner A. Kozma S.C. Hemmings B.A. Thomas G. Science. 1998; 279: 707-710Crossref PubMed Scopus (727) Google Scholar). Rapamycin inhibits the activity of FKBP12-rapamycin-associated protein (FRAP/RAFT) kinase by binding to its cognate binding protein, FK506-binding protein (FKBP12), thus inhibiting p70S6kstimulation (28Brown E.J. Albers M.W. Shin T.B. Ichikawa K. Keith C.T. Lane W.S. Schreiber S.L. Nature. 1994; 369: 756-758Crossref PubMed Scopus (1665) Google Scholar). FRAP/RAFT appears to lies either on downstream of PI3K or on a parallel pathway, because TPA-induced activation of p70S6k is insensitive to specific inhibitor for PI3K, wortmannin, which blocks growth factor-induced stimulation of PI3K and p70S6k, but still blocked by rapamycin (29Han J.W. Pearson R.B. Dennis P.B. Thomas G. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 21396-21403Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar). However, the precise mechanism by which FRAP or PI3K regulates p70S6ksignaling pathway remains to be elucidated. This uncertainty appears to be due to the complex nature of the p70S6k activation mechanism, which requires multiple hierarchical phosphorylation by several protein kinases (29Han J.W. Pearson R.B.

Wettenhall R.E.H. Thomas G. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 5279-5287Crossref PubMed Scopus (388) Google Scholar). Recently, one of them has been identified as phosphoinositide-dependent protein kinase PDK1 which activates p70S6k through phosphorylation at Thr229 (27Pullen N. Dennis P.B. Andjelkovic M. Dufner A. Kozma S.C. Hemmings B.A. Thomas G. Science. 1998; 279: 707-710Crossref PubMed Scopus (727) Google Scholar). Emerging evidence suggests that reactive oxygen species (ROS) at low concentration may function as signaling intermediators of cellular responses (31Schreck R. Baeuerle P.A. Trends Cell Biol. 1991; 1: 39-42Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (445) Google Scholar). Recently, the production of ROS has been reported in a wide variety of cell types, including vascular smooth muscle cells (32Yu M. Sundaresan Z.X. Ferrans V.J. Irani K. Finkel T.

The increase in production of ROS following various external stimuli has been associated with various cellular processes, such as cell proliferation (32Yu M. Sundaresan Z.X. Ferrans V.J. Irani K. Finkel T. Science. 1995; 270: 296-299Crossref PubMed Scopus (9724) Google Scholar) or apoptosis (42Jacobson M.D. Biochem.

Recently, ROS have been shown to stimulate signaling pathways implicated in growth factor and cytokine effects through activating their important components, such as MAPK, extracellular-regulated protein kinase (32Yu M.

In addition, ROS have been observed to induce the anchorage-independent growth in soft agar of mouse epidermal cell JB6 (46Gindhart T.D. Nakamura Y. Stevens L.A. Hegmeyer G.A. West M.W. Smith B.M. Colburn N.H. Carcinog. Compr. Surv. 1985; 8: 341-367PubMed Google Scholar), the competence-related proto-oncogenesc-fos and c-myc in JB6 (47Crawford D. Amstad P. Zbinden I. Cerutti P.A. Oncogene. 1988; 3: 27-32Google Scholar), and the phosphorylation of ribosomal protein S6 in vitro (48Larsson R. Cerutti P. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 17452-17458Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). These observations prompted us to investigate a possible involvement of ROS in the growth factor-stimulated p70S6k and p90Rskactivation pathway, with particular focus on the differential regulation of both pathways by ROS. Our findings support a pivotal role of ROS for p70S6k signaling pathway. Balb/c mouse epidermal cells (JB6) were grown at 37 °C in modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 8% fetal bovine serum in a humidified 5% CO2. 80% confluent cells were made quiescent by culturing for 24 h in modified Eagle's medium (MEM) containing no bovine serum. Serum-starved cells were treated at 37 °C with following stimuli: 0.33 unit/ml glucose/glucose oxidase or 500 nm TPA for 15 min, and 5 ng/ml PDGF or 50 nm EGF for 20 min. Alternatively, cells were pretreated for the indicated times at 37 °C with serum-free MEM containing 2 mm EGTA, 2, 10, and 20 μm BAPTA-AM, 30, 300, and 3000 unit/mlAspergillus niger catalase, 500 nm wortmannin, 5 nm rapamycin, or 5 μm PKC inhibitor Ro-31-8220 before stimulation. In some experiments, cells were pretreated for 24 h with 5 μm TPA. The controls were carried out by incubating the cells for the corresponding period in serum-free MEM containing dimethyl sulfoxide instead of the agents. Following stimulation, the cells were rinsed twice with a ice-cold wash buffer solution containing 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 120 mm NaCl, 20 mm NaF, 1 mm EDTA, 5 mm EGTA, 15 mm sodium pyrophosphate, 30 mm p-nitrophenyl phosphate, 1 mmbenzamidine, and 0.1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride and then extracted in the same buffer containing 1% Nonidet P-40. Cell extracts were collected with a plastic scraper, homogenized, and cleared by centrifugation at 4 °C for 15 min at 15,000 ×g. Protein concentration was measured by the method of Bradford, with bovine serum albumin as the standard. Aliquots of the supernatant were frozen in liquid nitrogen and stored at −70 °C. p70S6k and p90Rsk were immunoprecipitated by incubating 20 μg (total 200 μl) of protein/assay of cell extract to an antibody directed to the carboxyl-terminal 18 residues of p70S6k and the carboxyl-terminal 21 residues of p90Rskfor 2 h incubation at 4 °C, respectively. Immunoprecipitation was facilitated by the addition of protein A-Sepharose (20 μl) for 30 min at 4 °C on a shaking plate. The beads were then washed twice at 4 °C with an extraction buffer containing 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 120 mm NaCl, 20 mm NaF, 1 mm EDTA, 5 mm EGTA, 15 mm sodium pyrophosphate, 30 mm p-nitrophenyl phosphate, 1 mm benzamidine, 0.1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and 1% Nonidet P-40 and once with a dilution buffer containing 50 mm MOPS (pH 7.0), 1 mmdithiothreitol, 5 mm MgCl2, 10 mm p-nitrophenyl phosphate, and 1% Nonidet P-40. S6 kinase (p70S6k and p90Rsk) activity was assayed using the S6 peptide as substrate by incubating the immunoprecipitated S6 kinases for 30 min in 25 μl of reaction mixture containing 50 mmMOPS (pH 7.0), 5 mm MgCl2, 1 mmdithiothreitol, 10 mm p-nitrophenyl phosphate, 0.1% Nonidet P-40, 0.6 μm protein kinase inhibitor, and 12 μm ATP (plus 0.75 μCi of [γ-32P]ATP). The reaction was terminated by the addition of 10 μl of 100 mm EDTA (pH 7.0). Following a brief centrifugation, the supernatant was spotted on P-81 paper. Unincorporated [γ-32P]ATP was eliminated by three 10-min washes in 5% phosphoric acid, and phosphorylated S6 peptide bound to the paper was counted. The assays were carried out in duplicate. The results were calculated as units of S6 kinase activity/mg of protein lysate and expressed as the fold of increase over the control value. One unit of activity represents the transfer of 1 pmol of 32P i into S6 peptide/min under the assay condition. Cell lysates were boiled in Laemmli sample buffer for 3 min. Cell lysates containing 50 μg of total protein were subjected to SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (PAGE) on 15% slab gels for the determination of p70S6k and p42MAPK/44MAPK, and proteins were transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride membranes. Membranes were blocked for 30 min in PBS containing 0.1% Tween 20 and 5% (w/v) dry skim milk powder and incubated overnight with anti-p70S6k or anti-p42MAPK/44MAPK antisera. The membranes were then washed with PBS containing 0.1% Tween 20 and incubated for 2 h with an anti-rabbit secondary antibody. Bound antibodies were detected with the enhanced amplified alkaline phosphatase immunoblot system (Bio-Rad). Cells were grown on coverslips for 2 days and serum-free MEM for 1 day. The serum-starved cells were stabilized in serum-free MEM without phenol red for at least 30 min and stimulated with 5 ng/ml PDGF for different times. Sometimes, cells were preincubated with A. niger catalase (300 or 3000 unit/ml) for 20 min before treatment with PDGF or EGF for 5 min, respectively. For the last 10 min of stimulation, 5 μmH2DCFDA was added to monitor intracellular H2O2. Then the cells were immediately observed with a laser scanning confocal microscope (Carl Zeiss LSM 410). The images of samples excited by a 488 nm argon laser were filtered by a long pass 515 nm filter. Thirty cells were randomly selected from three independent experiments, and dichlorofluorescein fluorescence intensities of treated cells were compared with those of unstimulated cells (36Ohba M. Shibanuma M. Kuroki T. Nose K. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 126: 1079-1088Crossref PubMed Scopus (435) Google Scholar, 38Bae Y.S. Kang S.W. Seo M.S. Baines I.C. Tekle E. Chock P.B. Rhee S.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 217-221Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1098) Google Scholar). Catalase activity from nonstimulated or stimulated JB6 cell lysates was assayed by a slightly modified method of Aebi (49Aebi H. Methods Enzymol. 1984; 105: 121-126Crossref PubMed Scopus (18681) Google Scholar). Briefly, serum-starved JB6 cells (1 × 107 cells/ml) were incubated with A. niger catalase (3000 unit/ml) for the indicated times. After incubation, cells were washed twice in PBS, trypsinized, and homogenized in extraction buffer containing 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 120 mm NaCl, 20 mm NaF, 1 mm EDTA, 5 mm EGTA, 15 mm sodium pyrophosphate, 1 mm benzamidine, 0.1 mmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and 1% Nonidet P-40. Cell extracts were cleared by centrifugation at 15,000 × g for 15 min at 4 °C. Catalase activity was assayed using H2O2 (10 mm) as a substrate by incubating the catalase in the supernatants for 30 s in 1 ml of reaction mixture containing 50 mm sodium phosphate and potassium phosphate (pH 7.0). Activity was monitored as the decrease in absorbance following decomposition of H2O2 at 240 nm. Assays were carried out in duplicates, and the results were expressed as units of catalase activity/μg of protein lysate. Recently, peptide growth factors such as PDGF, basic fibroblast growth factor, and EGF have been demonstrated to produce ROS. One of the targets of ROS appears to be p42MAPK/p44MAPK (3Sturgill T.W. Ray L.B. Erikson E. Maller J.L. Nature. 1988; 334: 715-718Crossref PubMed Scopus (754) Google Scholar) which is upstream kinase of p90Rsk. On the other hand, an earlier observation revealed that exposure of mouse epidermal cells JB6 to ROS could activate a protein kinase in cellular extracts which phoshorylated ribosomal protein S6in vitro (48Larsson R. Cerutti P. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 17452-17458Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). These studies led to an assumption that p90Rsk, the downstream kinase of p42MAPK/p44MAPK, might be responsible for the induction of S6 phosphorylation in vitro. To examine the possibility, JB6 cells were arrested in G0, and the p42MAPK/p44MAPK phosphorylation and p90Rskactivity were measured after treatment of the cells with ROS generated extracellularly by glucose/glucose oxidase (G/GO) producing H2O2. As shown in Fig.1, G/GO treatment led to a dose-dependent phosphorylation of p42MAPK/p44MAPK and activation of p90Rsk, as measured by its slower migration on Western blots of one-dimensional SDS-PAGE and immune complex kinase assay (Fig. 1, A andB), respectively. The increase in p42MAPK/p44MAPK phosphorylation following ROS treatment was followed by the activation of p90Rsk. The increase in p90Rsk activity was transient after active oxygen treatment, with a peak of S6 phosphorylation occurring after 30 min. A slow inactivation of p90Rsk then ensued within 60 min (Fig.1 D). However, the increase in p42MAPK/p44MAPK phosphorylation was apparent as early as 5 min after the H2O2 treatment and sustained for more than 30 min (Fig. 1 C). This time discrepancy indicated that the activation of p42MAPK/p44MAPKpreceded activation of p90Rsk located in the downstream position. Taken together, these data demonstrate conclusively that H2O2 activates p42MAPK/p44MAPKand p90Rsk in mouse epidermal cell JB6. Consistent with the data presented herein, p42MAPK/p44MAPK activation in response to H2O2 has also been reported for other cell types (32Yu M. Sundaresan Z.X. Ferrans V.J. Irani K. Finkel T. Science. 1995; 270: 296-299Crossref PubMed Scopus (9724) Google Scholar, 44Guyton K.Z. Liu Y. Gorospe M. Xu Q. Holbrook N.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 4138-4142Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1140) Google Scholar). The kinetics of p90Rsk activation in JB6 cells following ROS exposure was not exactly consistent with that of total S6 kinase activation in cellular extracts (48Larsson R. Cerutti P. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 17452-17458Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), suggesting involvement of another family of S6 kinase, p70S6k, which is activated by virtually all mitogenic stimuli, including growth factors, cytokines, phorbol esters, and oncogenic products (7Ferrari S. Thomas G. CRC Crit. Rev. Biochem. Mol. Biol. 1994; 29: 385-413Crossref PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar). Indeed, treatment of mouse epidermal JB6 cells with G/GO caused a rapid phosphorylaton and activation of p70S6k, as judged by the slower migration of a family of bands on SDS-PAGE and by immune complex kinase assay, respectively (Fig. 2). The S6 phosphorylation increased dose-dependently (Fig. 2,C and D). The maximal activity found in the extracts of cells treated for 15 min was 6–7-fold higher than basal levels. Within 60 min, the activity and phosphorylation decreased substantially (Fig. 2, A and B). These results are similar to those found with growth factors or serum-treated various cell lines (50Olivier A.R. Ballou L.M. Thomas G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Bende S.M. LaFerla F.M. Am. J. Pathol. 1996; 148: 1797-1806PubMed Google Scholar). Despite their similarities, there are genetic and physiological differences between these two molecules that may reflect important functional differences. For instance, while over 50 mutations have been identified in PS1, only two mutations have been found in PS2 that are definitively linked to FAD: one in a group of eight Volga German kindreds (PS2N141I) and another in an Italian kindred (PS2M239V) (5Levy-Lahad E. Wasco W. Poorkaj P. Romano D.M. Oshima J. Yu W.H. Pettingell C.E. Jondro P.D. Schmidt S.D. Wang K. et al.Science. 1995; 269: 973-977Crossref PubMed Scopus (2203) Google Scholar, 6Rogaev E.I.

In addition, PS1 mutations cause an aggressive form of FAD with a particularly early age of onset, whereas PS2 is associated with a form of FAD that more closely resembles sporadic AD in terms of age of onset and disease duration (7Renbaum P. Levy-Lahad E. Cell. Mol. Life Sci. 1998; 54: 910-919Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). Physiologically, although PS1 and PS2 share in common certain features such as modulating Aβ production, there are also key distinctions. Regarding their effect on apoptosis, for example, wild-type PS2 (wtPS2), but not PS1, has been shown to be proapoptotic (8Vito P. Wolozin B. Ganjei J.K. Iwasaki K. Lacana E. D'Adamio L. J. Biol.

These changes may be highly relevant to the pathogenesis of AD, since calcium dysregulation can contribute to several key features of AD, including increased Aβ production (20Querfurth H.W. Selkoe D.J. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 4550-4561Crossref PubMed Scopus (214) Google Scholar, 21Querfurth H.W. Jiang J. Geiger J.D. Selkoe D.J. J.

Sci. 1994; 747: 382-406Crossref PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar). However, despite the likely significance of these changes to the pathogenesis of AD, no studies have yet reported the effects ofPS2 mutations on calcium signaling. Circumstantial experimental evidence supports the potential involvement of PS2 in intracellular calcium regulation. For instance, PS2 interacts with a calcium-binding protein, calsenilin, that has been shown to regulate the levels of the caspase-3 cleavage product of PS2 (25Buxbaum J.D. Choi E.K. Luo Y. Lilliehook C. Crowley A.C. Merriam D.E. Wasco W. Nat. Med. 1998; 4: 1177-1181Crossref PubMed Scopus (300) Google Scholar). Although the function of calsenilin remains to be determined, sequence homology with neuronal calcium sensor-1 suggests that it may play a role in regulating intracellular calcium levels. Moreover, PS2, but not PS1, interacts with another calcium-binding protein known as sorcin (26Kim T.-W. Pettingell W.P. Tanzi R.E. Soc. Neurosci. Abstr. 1998; 24: 757Google Scholar). Sorcin is known to modulate the activity of ryanodine receptors (27Meyers M.B. Pickel V.M. Sheu S.S. Sharma V.K. Scotto K.W. Fishman G.I. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 26411-26418Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar), a major type of intracellular calcium release channel, and has also been found to associate with l-type voltage-gated calcium channels (28Meyers M.B. Puri T.S. Chien A.J. Gao T. Hsu P.H. Hosey M.M. Fishman G.I. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 18930-18935Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar). Collectively, these findings suggest a possible physiological role for PS2 in regulating calcium signaling pathways, a function that may be modulated by FAD mutations. Here we studied the effects of wild-type PS2(wtPS2) and both of the identified FAD-linked PS2mutations on calcium signaling in Xenopus oocytes. We show that, relative to controls, both FAD mutations in PS2significantly potentiated calcium signals evoked by the ubiquitous intracellular second messenger inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate (IP3). Notably, both PS2 mutations also significantly accelerated decay rates of calcium signals evoked by high levels of IP3. These findings lend strong support to the hypothesis that alterations in calcium signaling pathways may be a common pathogenic mechanism by which presenilin mutations contribute to FAD. Full-length cDNAs encoding human wtPS2, PS2NI141I, and PS2M239Vwere the generous gift of Dr. John Hardy. Synthesis of m7G(5′)ppp(5′)G-capped cRNA was performed by run-off transcription of template plasmids linearized with the restriction endonuclease XbaI using the Riboprobe Gemini System (Promega) according to manufacturer's recommendations. The quantity and quality of the resulting transcripts were determined by spectrophotometric analysis and direct visualization on a denaturing gel as described elsewhere (17Leissring M.A. Paul B.A. Parker I. Cotman C.W. LaFerla F.M. J. Neurochem. 1999; 72: 1061-1068Crossref PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar). Stage V and VI oocytes ofXenopus laevis (Xenopus I, Ann Arbor, MI) were defolliculated by two 1-h treatments with 0.5 mg/ml collagenase and were injected the following day with 46 nl of the appropriate cRNA (500 ng/μl) or RNase-free H2O (17Leissring M.A. Paul B.A. Parker I. Cotman C.W. LaFerla F.M. J. Neurochem. 1999; 72: 1061-1068Crossref PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar). Three days after cRNA injection and 1–4 h prior to calcium imaging experiments, oocytes were loaded with 46 nl of a mixture containing 0.25 mm caged IP3 (c-IP3;d-myo-inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate,P 4(5)-(1-(2-nitrophenyl)ethyl) ester; Molecular Probes, Eugene, OR) and 1 mm of the low affinity calcium indicator Oregon Green-5N (OG-5N; Molecular Probes), yielding final concentrations in the oocytes of ∼12 and ∼46 μm, respectively. To ensure equal loading of the oocytes, we used a piston-driven Nanoject microinjector apparatus (Drummond Scientific) fitted with freshly pulled glass electrodes with tip diameters of ∼15–20 μm. Photolysis of c-IP3 to liberate free intracellular IP3 was achieved using flashes of UV light (340–400 nm) derived from a mercury arc lamp (17Leissring M.A. Paul B.A. Parker I. Cotman C.W. LaFerla F.M. J. Neurochem. 1999; 72: 1061-1068Crossref PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar). The concentration of IP3 photoreleased by UV light is a function of both flash duration, controlled by a mechanical shutter, and flash intensity, controlled by a neutral density filter (29Callamaras N. Parker I. Methods Enzymol. 1998; 291: 380-403Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). For experiments using supramaximal IP3 stimulation, the neutral density filter was reduced so that further increases in UV intensity failed to generate increased calcium signals in response to a fixed (200 ms) flash duration. Remaining experiments used a neutral density setting giving a flash intensity ∼57-fold weaker. Estimates of IP3 concentrations (see legend to Fig. 2) were calculated based on previous findings indicating that ∼50 nmIP3 is required to initiate a calcium wave (29Callamaras N. Parker I. Methods Enzymol. 1998; 291: 380-403Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). Calcium-dependent fluorescence changes of OG-5N in response to photoreleased IP3 were imaged using a custom-built line-scanning confocal microscope, and data were recorded and analyzed as described previously (30Sun X.P. Callamaras N. Marchant J.S. Parker I. J. Physiol. (Lond.). 1998; 509: 67-80Crossref Scopus (218) Google Scholar). Fluorescence intensities were averaged over a 50-μm scan line and are expressed as the change in intensity over the basal level of fluorescence prior to stimulation (ΔF/F o ). Statistical comparisons were made using two-factor analysis of variance with replication. All results are presented as mean values ± S.E. Immediately following completion of the calcium imaging experiments, cells were frozen for later processing. Protein extracts were prepared as described previously (17Leissring M.A. Paul B.A. Parker I. Cotman C.W. LaFerla F.M. J. Neurochem. 1999; 72: 1061-1068Crossref PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar) and concentrations determined by the Bradford method. Equal amounts of protein (10 μg) were separated by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis on 5 or 10% acrylamide gels, transferred to nitrocellulose membranes, blocked overnight in 5% non-fat milk in Tris-buffered saline (pH 7.5) supplemented with 0.2% Tween 20, and processed as described previously (17Leissring M.A. Paul B.A. Parker I.

The αPS2Nantibody (the generous gift of Dr. Carl Cotman) was generated in rabbits by immunization with a synthetic peptide corresponding to amino acids 8–21 of the PS2 protein, affinity-purified, and used at a dilution of 1:1000. Other antibodies and dilutions used in this study include PS2NT (1:5000; the generous gift of Dr. Gopal Thinakaran; Ref. 31Saura C.A. Tomita T. Davenport F. Harris C.L. Iwatsubo T. Thinakaran G. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 13818-13823Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar); PS2 loop antibody 3711 (1:500; the generous gift of Dr. Christian Haass; Ref. 32Walter J. Grunberg J. Schindzielorz A. Haass C. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 5961-5967Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar); and αIP3R-I, a rabbit polyclonal anti-type-I IP3 receptor antibody (Affinity Bioreagents, Golden, CO). Quantitative densitometric analyses were performed on digitized images of immunoblots using the Stratagene EagleEye II gel documentation system according to manufacturer's recommendations (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA). To determine whether PS2 mutations modulate IP3-mediated calcium signaling, we conducted fluorescent calcium imaging in Xenopus oocytes expressing wild-type or mutant PS2 and H2O-injected controls (Fig.1). Intracellular IP3 was liberated from a caged precursor by flashes of UV light. By varying the flash durations, different relative amounts of IP3 could be photoreleased in a reproducible manner. The rapid calcium signals evoked by photorelease of caged IP3 are almost exclusively due to liberation of calcium from the ER through IP3receptors and negligible amounts of calcium influx from outside the cell occur at this time scale (33Yao Y. Parker I. J. Physiol. (Lond.). 1993; 468: 275-295Crossref Scopus (47) Google Scholar). Relative to controls, cells expressing either PS2N141I orPS2M239V exhibited larger mean peak responses for each flash duration tested, whereas wtPS2-expressing cells produced responses intermediate between mutant-expressing and control cells (Fig. 1, A and B). Moreover, with increasing flash duration, mean peak calcium responses approached higher asymptotic maxima in mutant PS2-expressing cells relative to controls (e.g. for 120-ms flashes, ΔF/F o = 1.40 ± 0.08versus 0.93 ± 0.06 for PS2N141I-injected cells versus controls, respectively; p < 0.001; Fig. 1 B). To ensure that absolute maximal levels of IP3-mediated calcium release had been achieved, cells were further stimulated with supramaximal [IP3] (∼30 μ m; see “Experimental Procedures”). As with lower stimulus intensities, mean peak calcium responses following supramaximal IP3 stimulation were significantly increased in cells expressing PS2 mutations relative both towtPS2-expressing cells and to controls (Fig. 1 C). Therefore, PS2 mutations consistently increase the mean amplitude of calcium responses evoked by a wide range of IP3 levels. The threshold for IP3-mediated calcium release was lower in cells expressing PS2 mutations relative to controls, since we found that mutant-expressing cells responded more frequently than controls to the lowest flash durations tested. For example, in response to flash durations of 20 ms, six out of nine cells expressingPS2N141I responded as compared with only 1 of 10 H2O-injected controls (p < 0.001 by χ2 analysis). PS2M239V-expressing cells displayed even more marked differences, being the only cells to respond to flash durations of 10 ms (2 out of 10 trials; see Fig.1 B). Taken together, these data suggest that PS2mutations confer an increased sensitivity to IP3. We also examined the effects of PS2 mutations on the decay rates of calcium signals evoked by different concentrations of IP3, which were quantitated by measuring the half-decay time (t 12) of individual signals (Fig.2). At low [IP3] (∼0.15 μ m; see “Experimental Procedures”), calcium responses in wild-type and mutant PS2-expressing cells and controls decayed at similar rates (Fig. 2, A andB). By comparison, following supramaximal IP3stimulation (“high [IP3]”; ∼30 μm), decay rates were significantly slowed in wtPS2-expressing cells and controls (which were not significantly different from each other; Fig. 2, C and D). In striking contrast, decay rates were significantly accelerated in mutantPS2-expressing cells following supramaximal IP3stimulation relative to wtPS2-expressing cells and controls (Fig. 2, C and D; see also bold traces in Fig. 1 A). To ascertain if differences in calcium signaling were due to differences in PS2 expression levels, protein extracts from the oocytes used for calcium imaging experiments were subjected to Western analysis using several anti-PS2 antibodies (Fig.3 A). For each antibody tested, protein expression levels did not differ by more than 5% among thePS2 cRNA-injected conditions, as determined by densitometric analysis. Therefore, the increased potentiation observed in mutant PS2-expressing cells relative to wild-type PS2-expressing cells is not attributable to differences in protein expression levels. Interestingly, some antibodies, including the αPS2Nantibody (Fig. 3 A), also detected a weak band in the H2O-injected controls, presumably reflecting endogenousXenopus presenilin (34Tsujimura A. Yasojima K. Hashimoto-Gotoh T. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1997; 231: 392-396Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). To address the mechanism by which PS2 mutations potentiate IP3-mediated calcium release, we also conducted a Western analysis of type-I IP3 receptors (Fig. 3 B), which are the only type of calcium release channel expressed inXenopus oocytes (35Kume S. Muto A. Aruga J. Nakagawa T. Michikawa T. Furuichi T. Nakade S. Okano H. Mikoshiba K. Cell. 1993; 73: 555-570Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (203) Google Scholar). IP3 receptor protein levels differed only slightly (∼7%) between control cells and cells expressing wild-type or mutant PS2, and these small differences did not correlate consistently with the amplitudes of calcium responses in the various conditions. These findings indicate that mechanisms other than IP3 receptor up-regulation are responsible for the observed potentiation in IP3-mediated calcium signaling. The “calcium hypothesis” of AD proposes that perturbed intracellular calcium homeostasis plays a central role in AD neurodegeneration (36Khachaturian Z.S. Neurobiol. Aging. 1987; 8: 345-346Crossref PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar). In support of the idea, several distinct AD-linked PS1 mutations have been shown to modulate calcium signaling in a variety of systems, including fibroblasts from FAD patients (12Ito E. Oka K.

Neurochem. 1999; 72: 1061-1068Crossref PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar). However, to our knowledge, the effects of PS2 mutations on calcium signaling have not previously been examined. We addressed this question by measuring IP3-mediated calcium signals in Xenopus oocytes expressing wild-type PS2 and the two identified FAD-linked mutations in PS2. Calcium signals were potentiated in oocytes overexpressing wild-type PS2 as compared with H2O-injected controls, and a further potentiation was observed in oocytes expressing similar amounts of mutantPS2. Notably, the nature and extent of this potentiation closely resembles the results we observed for mutant PS1using identical methods in the same system (17Leissring M.A. Paul B.A. Parker I.

Therefore, FAD mutations in both PS1 and PS2 lead to similar alterations in IP3-mediated calcium signaling, providing further evidence that intracellular calcium dysregulation may represent a common pathophysiological consequence of all AD-linked presenilin mutations. Since elevated cytosolic calcium levels can lead to several hallmark features of AD, including increased levels of Aβ (20Querfurth H.W. Selkoe D.J.

Neurochem. 1998; 70: 1-14Crossref PubMed Scopus (229) Google Scholar), these findings lend additional support to the hypothesis that calcium dysregulation plays a causative role in the pathogenesis of AD. Conversely, our data do not reveal differences in IP3-mediated calcium signaling that may account for the contrasting functional differences between the PS1 and PS2 proteins. Oocytes expressing wild-type PS2 exhibited potentiated IP3-mediated calcium release relative to H2O-injected controls, albeit to a lesser extent than those expressing the FAD mutations. Overexpression of wild-typePS1 in the same system also produced a comparable potentiation in IP3-mediated calcium release (17Leissring M.A. Paul B.A. Parker I. Cotman C.W. LaFerla F.M. J. Neurochem. 1999; 72: 1061-1068Crossref PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar). Although the significance of these findings is not presently clear, these results may reflect a physiological function of endogenous presenilins in calcium signaling, a function that is perturbed by FAD mutations. Given the interaction of the presenilins with calsenilin (25Buxbaum J.D. Choi E.K. Luo Y. Lilliehook C. Crowley A.C. Merriam D.E. Wasco W. Nat. Med. 1998; 4: 1177-1181Crossref PubMed Scopus (300) Google Scholar), which is homologous to proteins involved in calcium homeostasis, and sorcin, which modulates calcium release through ryanodine receptors, this possibility warrants further investigation. Although the mechanism by which PS2 mutations potentiate IP3-mediated calcium signaling remains to be established, up-regulation of IP3 receptors does not appear to be involved, since comparable levels of IP3 receptor levels were present in control cells and in cells expressing wild-type and mutant PS2. Alternative possibilities may involve alteration of IP3-receptor function or overfilling of the ER calcium pools. In support of the latter idea, measurements of store content obtained by using thapsigargin to release calcium show an enhancement in PC-12 cells expressing mutant PS1 (14Guo Q. Furukawa K. Sopher B.L. Pham D.G. Xie J. Robinson N. Martin G.M. Mattson M.P. Neuroreport. 1996; 8: 379-383Crossref PubMed Scopus (298) Google Scholar). Rates of decay of calcium signals evoked by supramaximal [IP3] were also markedly accelerated by PS2mutations. The decay of the fluorescent calcium signal represents a balance between calcium efflux through activated IP3receptors and mechanisms that remove calcium ions from the cytosol (e.g. reuptake into the ER, uptake into mitochondria, extrusion across plasma membrane). Although we cannot entirely exclude effects of PS2 mutations on calcium sequestration mechanisms, it seems unlikely that this could result in an acceleration of calcium transport at high, but not low, [IP3]. One mechanism that may account for these results might be an increase in the rate of inactivation of IP3 receptors in the presence of high [IP3]. Alternatively, the accelerated decay rates might be due to the increased calcium release evoked by high [IP3] in the mutant PS2-expressing cells, since it is known that high local levels of cytosolic calcium can actually inhibit the opening of IP3 receptors (37Bezprozvanny I. Watras J. Ehrlich B.E. Nature. 1991; 351: 751-754Crossref PubMed Scopus (1419) Google Scholar). The fact that intracellular calcium signaling is modulated by mutations in both PS1 and PS2 increases support for the hypothesis that these disturbances play a causative role in the pathogenesis of FAD. In view of the central importance of intracellular calcium regulation for numerous cellular processes, elucidation of the mechanisms responsible for these changes is clearly warranted and could uncover novel targets for therapeutic intervention.

However, specific chaperones for the recruitment or concentration of secretory proteins into COPII-coated vesicles have not yet been identified. Although ERGIC-53 was identified in 1988 and is a well defined marker of the ERGIC, its function within the secretory pathway remains an enigma. ERGIC-53 is proposed to operate as a transport receptor for glycoproteins in the early secretory pathway, targeting them to COPII-coated vesicles budding from the ER for trafficking to the Golgi compartment (3Herrmann J.M.

Initial reports examining the role of ERGIC-53 suggested that most glycoproteins did not require a functional form of ERGIC-53 for efficient secretion (7Vollenweider F. Kappeler F. Itin C. Hauri H.P. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 142: 377-389Crossref PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar). Patients with combined deficiency of coagulation factors V and VIII have between 5 and 30% of normal plasma levels (by antigen and activity). The majority of patients with this autosomal recessive genetic bleeding disorder have null mutations in ERGIC-53. Although this suggests a factor V and factor VIII secretion defect, it is also possible that ERGIC-53 deficiency affects the production and/or stability of factors V and VIII (8Nichols W.C. Seligsohn U. Zivelin A. Terry V.H. Hertel C.E. Wheatley M.A. Moussalli M.J. Hauri H.P. Ciavarella N. Kaufman R.J. Ginsburg D. Cell. 1998; 93: 61-70Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (345) Google Scholar). Coagulation factors V and VIII are plasma glycoproteins of approximately 330 and 280 kDa, respectively, that function as essential cofactors in the blood coagulation cascade. They are both synthesized as single chain polypeptides having the identical domain structure of A1-A2-B-A3-C1-C2 (Fig. 1). Although their respective A and C domains exhibit 40% amino acid sequence identity and provide important structural and functional roles, the B domains have extensively diverged, are dispensable for their activity, and serve an unidentified function (9Toole J.J.

Blood. 1994; 84: 4214-4225Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). B domain-deleted (BDD) forms of factor VIII achieve higher mRNA levels and improved expression into cell media in vitro and into plasma in vivo and are utilized in a number of gene therapy strategies for hemophilia A (11Kaufman R.J. Hum. Gene Ther. 1999; 10: 2091-2107Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). In addition, BDD factor VIII has recently been approved for protein replacement therapy for hemophilia A (12Berntorp E. Thromb. Haemostasis. 1997; 78: 256-260Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). The B domains are encoded by single large exons and contain 25 and 18 N-linked oligosaccharide (GlcNAc2Man9Glc3) attachment sites for factor V and factor VIII, respectively. Within the early secretory pathway, these asparagine (N)-linked oligosaccharides undergo glucose trimming via sequential action of ER glucosidases I and II, and the GlcNAc2Man9Glc1 structures mediate the interactions of factors V and VIII with the ER lectin chaperones calnexin and/or calreticulin (13Pipe S.W. Morris J.A. Shah J. Kaufman R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 8537-8544Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar). We hypothesized the existence of a specialized pathway for the efficient secretion of a specific subset of heavily glycosylated proteins within higher eukaryotes. The post-translational processing and presentation of the mannose residues of their N-linked oligosaccharides may facilitate the interaction of this subset of glycoproteins with the mannose-binding ERGIC-53 (14Arar C.

In this report we show that efficient trafficking of factors V and VIII is impaired when ERGIC-53 is prevented from cycling between the ER and the Golgi. This impairment requires the B domains of these coagulation factors. In addition, ERGIC-53-dependent trafficking is dependent on post-translational modification of the N-linked oligosaccharides to fully glucose-trimmed, mannose9 structures.

HtTA-1 cell lines (HeLa) stably expressing a cDNA encoding either wild-type (WT) ERGIC-53 (KKFF) or cytosolic tail mutant ERGIC-53 (KKAA) under control of the tTA promotor were described previously (7Vollenweider F. Kappeler F. Itin C. Hauri H.P. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 142: 377-389Crossref PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar). Cells were maintained in 2 μg/ml tetracycline, 500 ng/ml puromycin, and 400 μg/ml geneticin (Life Technologies, Inc.). Cells were transiently transfected with the mammalian expression vector pMT2 (18Kaufman R.J. Methods Enzymol. 1990; 185: 487-511Crossref PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar) containing cDNA's encoding full-length factors V and VIII and B domain deleted forms. The lipofection method was used according to the manufacturer's recommendations (LipofectAMINE PLUS, Life Technologies, Inc.). Cells were maintained in the presence of tetracycline throughout the transfection and metabolic labeling unless indicated (+ induction), in which case tetracycline was removed at the time of transfection. For drug treatments with castanospermine (CST) (1 mm) and deoxymannojirimycin (DMJ) (1 mm), cells were treated for 1 h prior to metabolic labeling, and drug exposure was maintained throughout pulse and chase conditions. Protein synthesis and secretion were analyzed by metabolically labeling cells at 48 h post-transfection for 30 min with [35S]methionine (250 μCi/ml in methionine-free medium), followed by a chase for 3 h in medium containing 100-fold excess unlabeled methionine and 0.02% aprotinin.

The recycling of ERGIC-53 within the ERGIC is controlled by targeting epitopes at its cytosolic COOH terminus-a dilysine ER retrieval signal followed by a diphenylalanine ER exit determinant (KKFF) (4Kappeler F.

Matteson J. Balch W.E. J. Cell Biol. 1997; 137: 581-593Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). Previously, in a tetracycline-repressible system, HeLa cells were described that overexpress either WT or a mutant of ERGIC-53 that is unable to exit the ER due to mutation of the diphenylalanine epitope to alanines (KKAA) (7Vollenweider F. Kappeler F. Itin C. Hauri H.P. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 142: 377-389Crossref PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar). ERGIC-53 forms homo-hexamers, thus the mutant form of ERGIC-53 should oligomerize with the endogenous ERGIC-53, thus acting as a dominant negative to trap the majority of the ERGIC-53 within the ER (Fig.2 a). Previous immunofluorescence microscopy and density gradient analysis suggested that both the endogenous and mutant ERGIC-53 were quantitatively retained in the ER under inducible conditions (7Vollenweider F. Kappeler F. Itin C. Hauri H.P. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 142: 377-389Crossref PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar). Similarly, transfer of the KKAA C-terminal motif onto other proteins also resulted in their permanent ER retention (24Andersson H. Kappeler F. Hauri H.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 15080-15084Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar). We transfected expression vectors encoding full-length factors V and VIII into these HeLa cell lines and examined their efficiency of secretion using metabolic pulse-chase labeling with [35S]methionine. Upon removal of tetracycline, an approximately 10-fold induction in the expression of the recombinant ERGIC-53 (both WT and mutant forms) was observed (Fig. 2 b), as described previously (7Vollenweider F. Kappeler F. Itin C. Hauri H.P. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 142: 377-389Crossref PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar). Factor VIII and factor V were expressed and secreted into the conditioned medium from both the WT and mutant ERGIC-53 cells under tetracycline repression. However, upon induction of the recombinant forms of ERGIC-53, secretion from the WT cells was not significantly affected, demonstrating that the amount of ERGIC-53 expression was not limiting for efficient factors V and VIII secretion. In contrast, upon induction of the mutant ERGIC-53, there was 3-fold reduced secretion of factor V and 5-fold reduced secretion of factor VIII. Time course studies demonstrated that the impaired secretion was maximal at the earliest time points (1 h) and less significant with longer chase times (5 h) suggesting a kinetic effect (data not shown). This is consistent with the finding that ER to Golgi trafficking of the lysosomal enzyme procathepsin C was delayed in this cell system (7Vollenweider F. Kappeler F. Itin C. Hauri H.P. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 142: 377-389Crossref PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar). Thus, efficient secretion of factors V and VIII requires ERGIC-53 exit out of the ER. We hypothesize that in this cell system, bulk flow transport through a default, non-ERGIC-53-dependent pathway allows the ultimate secretion of factors V and VIII (25Wieland F.T. Gleason M.L. Serafini T.A. Rothman J.E. Cell. 1987; 50: 289-300Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (358) Google Scholar). We next examined the role of the B domains within factors V and VIII in mediating ERGIC-53-dependent transport (Fig. 3). BDD forms of factors V and VIII were transfected into the HeLa cell lines under identical conditions and their transport examined. Neither BDD factor V nor BDD factor VIII secretion were affected by induction of either WT or mutant forms of ERGIC-53. The minor variability in molecular weight observed for BDD factor V is likely because of differences in glycosylation between the two HeLa cell clones. Taken together, these observations demonstrate that the early secretory pathway is not generally disrupted under conditions of WT and mutant ERGIC-53 overexpression. In addition, it suggests that the clustering of N-linked oligosaccharide structures within the respective B domains of factors V and VIII mediates their interaction with ERGIC-53. The role of post-translational modifications of the N-linked oligosaccharides in mediating interaction with ERGIC-53 was studied by inhibiting either glucosidase or mannosidase activities (Fig. 4). CST inhibits the action of glucosidases I and II, thereby maintaining the GlcNAc2Man9Glc3 structure of theN-linked oligosaccharides. Expression of full-length factor V was examined in the HeLa cells both in the presence and absence of CST. As observed in Fig. 3, induction of WT ERGIC-53 had no effect on the secretion of factor V, whereas induction of the mutant ERGIC-53 reduced factor V secretion by 3-fold (Fig. 4; lanes 1, 2, 5, and 6). The impaired secretion of factor V (3-fold reduction) upon induction of mutant ERGIC-53 correlated with increased retention of factor V within the cell extract (Fig. 4; lanes 5 and 6). However, when FV was synthesized in the presence of CST, there was a 2-fold increase in the amount of FV rescued to secretion into the cell medium upon induction of the mutant ERGIC-53 (Fig. 4; lane 7). Concomitantly, there was less factor V protein retained within the cell extract. The slower mobility within the cell extract of the factor V synthesized in the presence of CST is consistent with the retention of the 3 glucose residues on the multiple N-linked oligosaccharides. We hypothesize a requirement for ERGIC-53 to recognize the proper presentation of the mannose residues on the N-linked oligosaccharides. The factor V polypeptides with the GlcNAc2Man9Glc3 oligosaccharide structures may escape retention by the mutant ERGIC-53 and are instead secreted by a default pathway. Finally, we tested whether ERGIC-53 recognized a specific mannose structure for efficient interaction (Fig. 4). DMJ inhibits the action of ER mannosidases 1 and 2, thereby inhibiting the removal of the outermost mannose residues of the middle and outer nonglucosylated branches of the GlcNAc2Man9 structure. DMJ had no effect on secretion of factor V in cells that express WT ERGIC-53 (Fig. 4; lane 4). In contrast, secretion of factor V, upon induction of mutant ERGIC-53, was inhibited 7-fold following incubation with DMJ, and this was accompanied by increased retention within the cell extract (Fig. 4; lane 8). This result suggests that the GlcNAc2Man9 oligosaccharide structure is the preferential substrate for interaction and the inability to trim the outer mannose residues leads to sustained retention of the glycoprotein by the mutant ERGIC-53. Co-immunoprecipitation of ERGIC-53/factor V or ERGIC-53/factor VIII, in the presence or absence of membrane-permeable cross-linking reagents, could not be demonstrated in extracts of cells expressing factor V or factor VIII, including Chinese hamster ovary cells, COS-1 monkey kidney cells, and HeLa cells (data not shown). In vitro pull-down assays using immunoprecipitated ERGIC-53 incubated directly with factor V or factor VIII conditioned medium also failed to demonstrate a direct interaction. These results suggest that this is a low affinity interaction, potentially consistent with a lectin-like function of ERGIC-53. Alternatively, this interaction may be mediated by one or more additional adapter proteins. These results demonstrate the ability of ERGIC-53 to influence the secretion efficiency of coagulation factors V and VIII, providing mechanistic insight into the molecular defect recently recognized in patients with null expression of ERGIC-53. These data also suggest a model for ERGIC-53 in recruiting factors V and VIII into budding COPII-coated vesicles through the recognition of specificN-linked oligosaccharide structures (Fig. 5). Our results suggest that it is the fully glucose-trimmed mannose9 oligosaccharide core structures, primarily clustered within the B domains of FV and FVIII that are recognized. The de-and re-glucosylation of N-linked oligosaccharide cores, mediated by the sequential actions of glucosidase II and UDP-glucose:glucosyltransferase, occurs during nascent folding of glycoproteins, facilitating retention within the ER prior to achieving the native folded structure (26Helenius A. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1994; 5: 253-265Crossref PubMed Scopus (562) Google Scholar, 27Hebert D.N. Foellmer B. Helenius A. Cell. 1995; 81: 425-433Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (490) Google Scholar). Trimming of mannose residues by ER mannosidase I has also been proposed as a mechanism for retention of misfolded nascent glycoproteins. For example, mutant variants of the soluble secretory protein alpha1-antitrypsin are retained within the ER bound to calnexin following mannose trimming of the GlcNAc2Man9Glc1 oligosaccharide core (28Liu Y. Choudhury P. Cabral C.M. Sifers R.N. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 5861-5867Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (217) Google Scholar). The GlcNAc2Man8Glc1structure does not undergo further glucose trimming but is rather targeted for degradation by ER-associated degradation machinery. In this manner, it has been proposed that ER mannosidase1 acts as a “clock” regulating the disposal of those glycoproteins that are mutant or fold inefficiently (28Liu Y. Choudhury P. Cabral C.M. Sifers R.N. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 5861-5867Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (217) Google Scholar). Only properly folded glycoproteins, following terminal glucose trimming, are in turn able to begin trafficking to the Golgi. The investigation of the trafficking of factors V and VIII provides insight into the latter phase of this ER quality control system, highlighting the importance of the terminal mannose residues. By recognizing the fully glucose-trimmed mannose9 oligosaccharide cores of factors V and VIII, ERGIC-53 can recruit only properly folded native proteins into the secretory vesicles of the ERGIC for trafficking to the Golgi. Further mannose trimming by Golgi mannosidase may ensure unidirectionality for ERGIC-53 chaperone function. Recent analysis of additional families with combined deficiency of factors V and VIII has identified a significant subset of patients (∼26%) that express normal levels of ERGIC-53 antigen and appear to have a genetic defect corresponding to another genetic locus (29Neerman-Arbez M. Johnson K.M. Morris M.A. McVey J.H. Peyvandi F. Nichols W.C. Ginsburg D. Rossier C. Antonarakis S.E. Tuddenham E.G. Blood. 1999; 93: 2253-2260Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Thus, at least one additional protein appears to be required for the efficient secretion of FV and FVIII. We hypothesize that this gene product functions either upstream or downstream of ERGIC-53 in facilitating the efficient secretion of a limited subset of glycoproteins. Glucosidase II would be a potential upstream candidate, as an inability to remove the terminal glucose residue from the core oligosaccharide structures would impair the proper presentation of the mannose residues and reduce the efficiency of recruitment into secretion vesicles. It is also possible that another gene product functions in a similar manner as ERGIC-53. There is precedence for similar ERGIC chaperones in yeast (30Schimmoller F. Singer-Kruger B. Schroder S.

Erv14p (ER-vesicle protein of 14 kDa) is an integral ER membrane protein, localized to the ER and packaged into COPII-coated vesicles that shares sequence identity to the Drosophila cornichon gene product (mutations of which lead to disruption of anterior-posterior pattern formation during the early stages of Drosophila oogenesis). erv14Dyeast strains exhibit normal secretion of a variety of proteins. However they exhibit a unique deficiency in secretion of the transmembrane protein, Axl2p, a glycoprotein with 16 potentialN-linked oligosaccharides, required for an axial budding pattern. Thus Erv14p, localized to the ER and packaged into COPII-coated vesicles, may also function in recruiting a limited set of glycoproteins into these vesicles to facilitate their efficient trafficking. Vesicular-Integral membraneProtein of 36 kDa, or VIP-36, is another ERGIC-53 homologue isolated from MDCK cells (33Fiedler K. Parton R.G. Kellner R. Etzold T. Simons K.

Cell Sci. 1996; 109: 271-276Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), which was recently shown to recognize high-mannose type glycans (35Hara-Kuge S. Ohkura T. Seko A. Yamashita K. Glycobiology. 1999; 9: 833-839Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar) although the specific role for its lectin binding characteristics in sorting within the trans-Golgi network is still not known. The results reported here suggest that the B domains of factors V and VIII, and potentially similar heavily glycosylated structures, may provide quality control by mediating the retention of misfolded protein variants within the ER and efficient secretion of the properly folded native forms. Our results demonstrate that a functional ERGIC-53 cycling pathway is required to increase the secretion efficiency of factors V and VIII. ERGIC-53 homologues have been identified in yeast (36Schroder S. Schimmoller F. Singer-Kruger B. Riezman H. J. Cell Biol. 1995; 131: 895-912Crossref PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar) and have been conserved from Caenorhabditis elegans toXenopus, rat and man (37Lahtinen U. Hellman U. Wernstedt C. Saraste J. Pettersson R.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 4031-4037Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). Therefore, ERGIC-53 appeared in evolution prior to the blood coagulation system and may represent a general transport system to increase the efficiency of ER to Golgi transport for a variety of glycoproteins. Coagulation factors V and VIII have uniquely evolved to usurp this transport system. The existence of ERGIC-53 to facilitate selective glycoprotein transport provides the first example of a chaperone that mediates ER to Golgi transport in higher eukaryotic cells."

The spectrum of antibacterial activity, always limited to Gram-negatives, is further dependent on a small number of variable residues and can be manipulated. We show here that mutations in the evolutionary conserved regions result in a more general loss of function, and we have used such analogs to probe molecular interactions in Escherichia coli. First, an assay was developed to measure selectively chiral association with cellular targets. By using this method, we find that apidaecin uptake is energy-driven and irreversible and yet can be partially competed by proline in a stereospecific fashion, results upholding a model of a permease/transporter-mediated mechanism. This putative transporter is not the end point of apidaecin action, for failure of certain peptide analogs to kill cells after entering indicates the existence of another downstream target. Tetracycline-induced loss of bactericidal activity and dose-dependent in vivo inhibition of translation by apidaecin point at components of the protein synthesis machinery as likely candidates. These findings provide new insights into the antibacterial mechanism of a unique group of peptides and perhaps, by extension, for distant mammalian relatives such as PR-39.

Pore-forming is not dependent on recognition of chiral molecules, for it is well established that all-d enantiomers are equally active (40Wade D. Boman A. Wahlin B. Drain C.M. Andreu D. Boman H.G.

Biochem. 1991; 202: 849-854Crossref PubMed Scopus (289) Google Scholar). Best characterized to date is apidaecin, a short peptide (18 amino acids) originally isolated from honeybees, that is lethal for many Gram-negative bacteria (7Casteels P. Ampe C. Jacobs F. Vaeck M. Tempst P. EMBO J. 1989; 8: 2387-2391Crossref PubMed Scopus (337) Google Scholar, 11Casteels P. Romagnolo J. Castle M. Casteels-Josson K. Erdjument-Bromage H. Tempst P. J. Biol.

Killing occurs very rapidly, through a not as yet understood mechanism (7Casteels P. Ampe C. Jacobs F. Vaeck M. Tempst P. EMBO J. 1989; 8: 2387-2391Crossref PubMed Scopus (337) Google Scholar). The most unique feature about its mode-of-action is a total lack of pore-forming activity. In addition, all-d enantiomers are devoid of any measurable function, indicating a significant degree of stereospecificity (44Casteels P. Tempst P. Bioch. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1994; 199: 339-345Crossref PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar). To begin to understand the functional role of each amino acid in the apidaecin structure, we have previously isolated 13 isotypes from various hymenopteran insects (11Casteels P. Romagnolo J. Castle M. Casteels-Josson K. Erdjument-Bromage H. Tempst P. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 26107-26115Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Sequence alignment delineated conserved “core” regions, most likely essential for activity. Subsequent functional analysis revealed striking differences between the antibacterial spectra of individual isotypes, implying that the structural elements underlying such specificities resided within the short stretches of “variable” sequence (11Casteels P. Romagnolo J. Castle M. Casteels-Josson K. Erdjument-Bromage H. Tempst P. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 26107-26115Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In some instances, subtle changes would switch the spectra to mutually exclusive patterns. For example, replacing one Arg and one Gln in isotype Cd1− with lysines (isotype Cd3-) abolished all original activity againstYersinia enterocolitica, yet created a peptide that was lethal for Campylobacter jejuni, whereas the initial “Cd1−” was not. Thus, apidaecin-type peptides consist of “constant” regions, conferring general antibacterial capacity (i.e. any modifications are predicted to reduce or eliminate function), and variable regions, determining specificity of the spectrum. Collectively, the data suggest that apidaecin antibacterial function may be transporter-based. If indeed the case, species-related differences in homologous “receptor/docking” molecules, proteins perhaps, would explain the contrasting antibacterial spectra of different isotypes; and novel mutations could conceivably result in unique bacterial mutants, resistant to one particular isotype but still sensitive to others, as observed (11Casteels P. Romagnolo J. Castle M. Casteels-Josson K. Erdjument-Bromage H. Tempst P. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 26107-26115Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Here, we present strong corroborating evidence for a transporter-mediated mechanism. By using a biological assay to selectively measure chiral interactions with bacterial targets, we show that uptake is energy-driven and virtually irreversible and yet partially competable by proline in a stereospecific fashion. Failure of certain peptide mutants to kill cells after entering indicates the existence of at least one other downstream target. Several lines of evidence, including in vivo inhibition of translation, suggest this could be a component of the protein synthesis machinery. Chemical synthesis of apidaecin (isoform Ho+, GKPRPQQVPPRPPHPRL, and analogs)-type peptides and magainin 2 (GIGKFLHSAKKFGKAFVGEIMNS) was performed with an automated instrument, model 433A (PE Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA), as described (11Casteels P.

Chem. 1994; 269: 26107-26115Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar).N-(9-Fluoroenyl)methoxycarbonyl (Fmoc)1-protectedl-amino acids were obtained from Anaspec (San Jose, CA); Fmoc-d-amino acids, Fmoc-l-amino acid resins, and Fmoc-d-Leu-Wang and Fmoc-d-Ser(t-butyl)-Wang resins were from Novabiochem (San Diego, CA). Trifluoroacetic acid promoted cleavage from the resin, and extraction and purification by one or more rounds of preparative reversed-phase high performance liquid chromatography (RP-HPLC) were also as documented (11Casteels P. Romagnolo J. Castle M. Casteels-Josson K. Erdjument-Bromage H. Tempst P. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 26107-26115Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Stocks were initially quantitated by amino acid composition analysis (Protein/DNA Technology Center, Rockefeller University, New York, NY) and periodically thereafter by RP-HPLC. In case of radiolabeled peptides, the automated synthesis process was stopped with just one cycle to go (before addition of the N-terminal glycine, common to apidaecin and analogs, and magainin 2), after removal of the Fmoc group. Peptide resin was then washed five times with dimethylformamide (DMF), and 910 nmol were taken for manual addition of [14C]glycine, as follows. Two ml of an Fmoc-[1-14C]Gly-OH (55 mCi/mmol, 0.1 mCi/ml ethanol; from American Radiolabeled Chemicals, St. Louis, MO) solution were dried down in a SpeedVac and redissolved by adding 1 ml of DMF, 0.25 ml of 1 m 1,3-diisopropylcarbodiimide in DMF, 33.75 mg of 1-hydroxybenzotriazole, and 5 mg of dimethylaminopyridine, before mixing with the resin. Coupling was done for 15 h at room temperature while shaking vigorously, followed by several washes with DMF, dichloromethane/DMF (3:2 by volume), and finally with dichloromethane, before drying. After transfer to a 10-ml PolyPrep disposable chromatography column (Bio-Rad), peptides were cleaved from the resin, and deprotected, for 2 h at room temperature in a solution (2-ml total volume) consisting of 1.67 ml of trifluoroacetic acid, 125 μl of phenol, 42 μl of 1,2-ethanedithiol, 84 μl of thioanisole, and 84 μl of water. Peptide solutions were then vacuum filtered away from the resin, straight into ice-coldtert-methyl butyl ether for precipitation; peptides were collected by centrifugation, followed by four more washes with ether, lyophilized, and redissolved in 10% acetic acid before RP-HPLC purification. Peak fractions (from UV detection) were screened for the correct product by matrix-assisted laser-desorption/ionization time-of-flight mass spectrometry (MALDI-TOF MS), using a Voyager RP system (Perspective Biosystems, Framingham, MA), and lyophilized. A 20% solution of piperidine in DMF was then added to cover the dried powder and stirred for 30 min at room temperature to remove the N-terminal Fmoc-protecting group, followed by 20-fold dilution with 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid in water and another round of RP-HPLC. Quality control was done by analytical RP-HPLC and MALDI-TOF MS; stocks were quantitated (see above), and radioactivity was measured by liquid scintillation counting (model LS600IC; Beckman Coulter, Fullerton, CA). Typically, specific activity was on the order of 60,000 cpm/μg peptide. The following bacterial strains (except one) were obtained from the American Type Culture Collection (ATCC, Manassas, VA): Acinetobacter calcoaceticus ATCC 49137,Agrobacterium tumefaciens ATCC 15955, Escherichia coli ATCC 25922 and 11775, Enterobacter cloacae ATCC 529, Klebsiella pneumoniae ATCC 13883, Salmonella typhimurium ATCC 14028, Salmonella typhi ATCC 6539, andShigella dysenteriae ATCC 13313; E. coli strain D22 is an outer membrane defective mutant, derived from strain K-12 (39Boman H.G. Agerberth B. Boman A. Infect. Immun. 1993; 61: 2978-2984Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 44Casteels P. Tempst P. Bioch. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1994; 199: 339-345Crossref PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar). All strains were handled under conditions and in a laboratory environment in compliance with Biosafety Level 2 for Infectious Agents as set forth in Health and Human Services Publication (NIM) 88-8395. For well assays, an aliquot of an overnight culture was inoculated into BHI broth (BBL, Becton-Dickinson, Cockeysville, MD) and grown at 37 °C with shaking at 150 rpm until the cell suspension became moderately turbid. An aliquot of the suspension was then diluted into 10% BHI broth until the turbidity matched the density of a 0.5 McFarland (Remel; Renexa, KS) standard. This procedure produced cells at a density that grow just confluently when plated with a cotton swab on Nutrient Agar (Difco) plates. Subsequent to swabbing the plate with bacterial cells, 10-μl capacity wells (3 mm diameter) were punched into the agar surface. Peptide solutions (10 μl) were then delivered to the wells. In case of filter assays, filters (0.25-inch; BBL) were impregnated with peptide and then placed on the surface of the plate. After 16 h of incubation at 37 °C, all plates were screened for zones of inhibition. Plating was also used to determine number of viable cells. Serial dilutions were made in sterile 0.9% NaCl, and aliquots of the dilution series were removed for triplicate plating on tryptic soy agar (Difco) plates. After spreading, plates were incubated overnight at 37 °C and colonies counted. An aliquot of an overnight culture was inoculated into BHI broth until the cell suspension became moderately turbid, then diluted into 10% BHI broth to match turbidity of a 0.5 McFarland standard, and diluted 1:1000 in fresh 10% BHI broth. MICs of peptides for cells were determined in round-bottomed, 96-well microtiter plates; total volume of each well was 200 μl. Preliminary assays determined the appropriate peptide concentration range, and then peptides were distributed to wells in successive 2-fold dilutions; control wells did not contain peptide. The final suspension of cells was 1000–5000 colony-forming units (cfu) per ml in 10% BHI. Growth of cells in the microtiter plates was determined by visual inspection after 24 h incubation at 37 °C. MIC is defined as the lowest concentration tested that inhibits bacterial growth. E. coli ATCC 25922 cells were grown in BHI broth overnight, at 37 °C. An aliquot of this culture was inoculated into fresh BHI and incubated at 37 °C with shaking (150 rpm) until the culture reached 0.5–0.6A 600; cells were pelleted and washed with 4 times the original culture volume of 10% BHI. The final pellet was resuspended in 10% BHI at a cell density of 5 × 109cfu/ml. One-ml aliquots were then incubated with 1–10 μg of radiolabeled (60,000–600,000 cpm) peptide in Uptake Assay Broth (10% BHI) for 30 min at 22 °C, unless otherwise stated. In all cases where higher peptide concentrations were used, unlabeled peptide was added to yield the desired amount. After reaction, cells were pelleted, and the reaction supernatant (“wash 0”) was collected into Liquid Scintillation Fluid (Scintiverse, Fisher). The resulting pellet was resuspended in Wash Buffer (fresh 10% BHI, containing 150 mm NaCl) by vortexing, and the procedure was repeated for the remainder of the washes. After removing the last (typically 11th) wash supernatant, the final pellet was resuspended in the original reaction volume of Wash Buffer. If desired, an aliquot of the resuspended pellet is removed for determining viable plate counts. The resuspended pellet and all wash supernatants were inspected for the presence of labeled peptides by liquid scintillation counting. Pellet counts were corrected for removal of the viable plate count aliquot. Experimental variations to the above listed procedure were introduced in the course of this study, as follows. Assay broth was at times supplemented with 0.2 mm MgCl2 or 25 mm NaCl. l-Pro, d-Pro, or all-l Arg-Pro-Lys-Pro (all from Sigma) were sometimes added to the incubation mixture to give 10 mm final concentrations, just seconds before addition of the labeled peptides. Tetracycline (8 μg/ml; Sigma) or 2,4-dinitrophenol (5 mmfinal concentration; Sigma) were added to cell suspensions for 15 h, respectively, and 3 h at 30 °C while shaking; cells were then pelleted, washed with 25 ml of 10% BHI, repelleted, and resuspended in 1 ml of assay broth before addition of labeled peptides. E. coli ATCC 25922 cells were grown in Nutrient Broth (Difco) overnight at 37 °C. An aliquot of this culture was inoculated into fresh Nutrient Broth until the cell suspension reached anA 660 of 0.1. Incorporation reactions were done in round-bottomed 96-well microtiter plates. Total volume in each well was 300 μl, containing 100 μl cells and 200 μl 50% Nutrient Broth with either 2-μCi ofl-[4,5-3H]leucine (135 Ci/mmol),30 μCi ofl-[35S]methionine (>1000 Ci/mmol), or 2 μCi of [5,6-3H]uridine (39.0 Ci/mmol). Radiolabeled chemicals were purchased from Amersham Pharmacia Biotech. Tetracycline hydrochloride and rifampin were obtained from Sigma. TET stock solutions were prepared at 10 mg/ml in water; RIF stocks were 10 mg/ml in methanol. Reactions that contained these drugs had concentrations of 8.3 μg/ml TET and 83 μg/ml RIF. Reactions that contained apidaecin (lHo+) had concentrations that varied from 1.7 to 17 μg/ml. At various time points, 50-μl aliquots of the reaction mixtures were removed to 200 μl of ice-chilled 20% trichloroacetic acid and allowed to precipitate. After 30 min of precipitation on ice, 200-μl aliquots were delivered into 3 ml of ice-chilled 5% trichloroacetic acid. Glass microfiber filters (24-mm diameter circles; Whatman, Hillsboro, OR) were pre-washed with 1 ml of ice-chilled 5% trichloroacetic acid, and the sample was then filtered under vacuum. The filter was next washed three times with 3 ml of ice-chilled 5% trichloroacetic acid, followed by three 2-ml washes with 100% ethanol. Filters were dried under a heat lamp, immersed in scintillation fluid, and counted in a liquid scintillation counter. Taking the model of constant and variable regions as a platform for further study, we carried out an alanine scan of the conserved sequence in apidaecin, isotype Ho+ (sequence from Ref. 11Casteels P.

Agar plate diffusion tests were used to assay antibacterial activity of all synthetic analogs. The results of serial dilution experiments using wild type Ho+ (see TableI) initially served to devise a scoring system for loss-of-activity based on shrinking inhibition zones (····· corresponds to the biggest zones; · denotes the smallest visible inhibition); a decrease by one such arbitrary unit corresponds to a roughly 1–2 order of magnitude drop in activity.Table IPlate inhibition zone assays of serially diluted apidaecin (Ho+ isotype)StrainAmount Ho+ (nmol)50251052.51.250.50.250.05 inhibition zones, mmE. coli25922161615131211108E. coli D22151512.511.5109987Agrobacterium1515986E. coli25922······························E. coliD22···························Agrobacterium···············Conditions and bacterial strain identification are given under “Experimental Procedures”; all strains were grown on nutrient agar.

Microbiol. 1996; 62: 4652-4655Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), replacing conserved Pro or Arg residues (which define the “PR-rich” peptide antibiotics) with Ala reduced apidaecin inhibitory effects on all bacterial strains tested (TableII). Attenuation resulting from each of the four Pro → Ala point mutations varied to some extent, in a species-dependent manner. Analog “P10A” was considerably less potent than “P13A” to inhibit growth of E. coli, Klebsiella, and Shigella strains but, by comparison, worked better against Acinetobacter. Even more pronounced differences were found between the two Arg → Ala analogs. From the inhibition zone data, we estimated that analog “R16A” was at the very least 2 orders of magnitude less active than analog “R11A” and 3 orders less than wild type Ho+. To investigate if the strict Arg conservation was solely based in its ionic nature, a double mutant (R11K/R16K) was synthesized and found to exert greatly reduced activity, suggestive of a role beyond merely contributing to charge state or amphiphilic structure.Table IIAntibacterial spectra of 15 apidaecin (Ho+ isotype) analogsStrainsPeptides (50 nmol)Ho+P10AP12AP13AP15AR11AR16AR11K/R16KH14AH14RH14QL17AL17GHo+ (1–16)L17SL17LE. coli11775······································−······E. coli25922···········································−········E. coliD22············································−·······E. cloacae···········································−·········K. pneumoniae································−········S. typhimurium····································−········S. typhi············································−··········S. dysenteriae············································−········A. calcoaceticus····−−−−−−−−−−−−−··A. tumefaciens····················−−−······−−····Listed are the results of agar plate inhibition zone assays.

Extinction in experimental populations of brine shrimp (Artemia franciscana) was measured to assess hypothesized extinction processes. Greater initial population size, greater maximum population size supported by the environment, and lower variation in environmental conditions reduced the likelihood of extinction, as hypothesized. However, initial population size was less important, and maximum population size and environmental variation were more important than often hypothesized. Unexpectedly, deterministic oscillations in population size due to inherent nonlinear dynamics and overcrowding were as important or more important than hypothesized processes."

It is unclear whether lineage commitment is mechanistically distinct from the process that selects for the survival of T cells with useful T cell receptor (TCR) specificities (positive selection). In HD mice, which lack mature CD4+ T cells, major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class II-restricted T cells are redirected to the CD8 lineage independent of MHC class I expression. However, neither TCR-mediated signaling nor positive selection is impaired. Thus, the HD mutation provides genetic evidence that lineage commitment may be mechanistically distinct from positive selection."

In combination with quantum yield measurements and thermochemical calculations, this measurement provides an enthalpy of formation for CBD of 114 +/- 11 (2final sigma) kilocalories per mole (kcal/mol). The extraordinary reactivity of this prototypical antiaromatic hydrocarbon had previously made its heat of formation inaccessible except by theoretical calculations. Relative to a hypothetical strainless, conjugated diene reference, CBD is destabilized by a total of 87 kcal/mol, 32 kcal/mol of which can be attributed to ring strain and 55 kcal/mol to antiaromaticity (compared with 21 kcal/mol for the aromatic stabilization of benzene). Relative to a reference with isolated double bonds, CBD's antiaromaticity is 48 kcal/mol (compared with 32 kcal/mol for the aromaticity of benzene)."

In their anatomical organization they may form a modern counterpart to the structural plan proposed for the eyes of some trilobites. Externally they differ from the usual ""insect plan"" by presenting far fewer but much larger lenses. Beneath each lens is its own independent retina. Anatomical and optical measurements indicate that each of these units is image-forming, so that the visual field is subdivided into and represented by ""chunks,"" unlike the conventional insect compound eye that decomposes the visual image in a pointwise manner.

https://openalex.org/W2041687977,"The MN/CA 9 (MN) gene encodes a tumor-associated isoenzyme of the carbonic anhydrase family. Functional characterization of the 3.5-kilobase pair MN 5′ upstream region by deletion analysis led to the identification of the −173 to +31 fragment as the MN promoter. In vitro DNase I footprinting revealed the presence of five protected regions (PRs) within the MN promoter. Detailed deletion analysis of the promoter identified PR1 and PR2 (numbered from the transcription start) as the most critical for transcriptional activity. PR4 negatively affected transcription, since its deletion led to increased promoter activity and was confirmed to function as a promoter-, position-, and orientation-independent silencer element. Mutational analysis indicated that the direct repeat AGGGCacAGGGC is required for efficient repressor binding. Two components of the repressor complex (35 and 42 kDa) were found to be in direct contact with PR4 by UV cross-linking. Increased cell density, known to induce MN expression, did not affect levels of PR4 binding in HeLa cells. Significantly reduced repressor level seems to be responsible for MN up-regulation in the case of tumorigenic CGL3 as compared with nontumorigenic CGL1 HeLa × normal fibroblast hybrid cells."

Fibrillins, which are components of elastic tissue 10-nm microfibrils, resemble LTBPs in protein domain structure, both consisting of multiple copies of conserved 8-cysteine repeats and epidermal growth factor like (EGF-like) repeats. In the large latent complex the association between the latent TGF-β1 and LTBP-1 is mediated by the third 8-cysteine repeat of LTBP-1 (18Saharinen J. Taipale J. Keski-Oja J. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 245-253Crossref PubMed Scopus (190) Google Scholar, 19Gleizes P.E. Beavis R.C. Mazzieri R. Shen B. Rifkin D.B. J. Biol.

Immunofluorescence and electron microscopic studies suggest also that LTBPs have roles as structural extracellular matrix proteins, since at least LTBP-1 and LTBP-2 have been observed to localize to 10-nm extracellular matrix microfibrils, similar to those containing fibrillins (20Gibson M.A. Hatzinikolas G.

At least LTBP-1 and -4 have been detected to possess amino-terminally distinct forms (26Tsuji T. Okada F. Yamaguchi K. Nakamura T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 8835-8839Crossref PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar, 27Olofsson A. Ichijo H. Moren A. ten Dijke P. Miyazono K. Heldin C.H. J. Biol.

Chem. 1998; 273: 18459-18469Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar). Alternatively spliced exons have also been detected at the 5′-end of Fibrillin-1 (28Corson G.M. Chalberg S.C. Dietz H.C. Charbonneau N.L. Sakai L.Y. Genomics. 1993; 17: 476-484Crossref PubMed Scopus (227) Google Scholar). LTBP-1L (long) is a splice variant, which contains an amino-terminal extension of 346 amino acids not found in the smaller LTBP-1S (small) isoform (27Olofsson A. Ichijo H. Moren A. ten Dijke P. Miyazono K. Heldin C.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 31294-31297Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). The mRNA expression patterns of the isoforms in different human tissues suggest that they are regulated in a tissue-specific manner. LTBP-1L is mainly expressed in heart, placenta, kidney, and prostate, whereasLTBP-1S has a wider expression pattern and appears also in lung, skeletal muscle, testis, and ovary (27Olofsson A. Ichijo H. Moren A. ten Dijke P. Miyazono K. Heldin C.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 31294-31297Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). The molecular mechanisms that lead to their diverse expression patterns are not known. LTBP-1 is considered to play an important role in the assembly and efficient secretion of the small latent TGF-β1 complex (29Miyazono K. Olofsson A. Colosetti P. Heldin C.H. EMBO J. 1991; 10: 1091-1101Crossref PubMed Scopus (423) Google Scholar, 30Miyazono K. Thyberg J. Heldin C.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 5668-5675Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). After secretion LTBP-1 is known to target TGF-β1 to the extracellular matrix (9Taipale J. Miyazono K. Heldin C.H. Keski-Oja J. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 124: 171-181Crossref PubMed Scopus (374) Google Scholar), which probably serves as a storage place, from which the growth factor can be activated effectively. The longer, amino-terminal extended isoform of LTBP-1 is known to associate more efficiently than LTBP-1S with the extracellular matrix (27Olofsson A. Ichijo H. Moren A. ten Dijke P. Miyazono K. Heldin C.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 31294-31297Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). Interestingly, studies of transformed cells have revealed a decrease in the production and secretion of LTBP-1, or even its total absence in these cells. Certain osteosarcoma cells secrete TGF-β1 in a small latent complex lacking LTBP-1 (8Dallas S.L. Park-Snyder S. Miyazono K. Twardzik D. Mundy G.R. Bonewald L.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 6815-6821Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Immunohistochemical analysis of prostatic carcinoma indicated that in malignant tissue TGF-β1 is produced without association with LTBP-1 (31Eklov S. Funa K. Nordgren H. Olofsson A. Kanzaki T. Miyazono K. Nilsson S. Cancer Res. 1993; 53: 3193-3197PubMed Google Scholar). In human gastrointestinal carcinomas no expression of LTBP-1 was detected and TGF-β1 remained in the cytosol of cancer cells suggesting defects in the secretory pathway of the growth factor (32Mizoi T. Ohtani H. Miyazono K. Miyazawa M. Matsuno S. Nagura H. Cancer Res. 1993; 53: 183-190PubMed Google Scholar). The present study was carried out to determine how the two diverse transcripts of LTBP-1 are formed and to examine the putative differences in their transcriptional regulation in normal and transformed cells. Characterization and functional analyses of the upstream regions of LTBP-1 isoforms revealed that their transcription is regulated independently from distinct promoter regions. Determination of the genomic structure of LTBP-1L splice site further refined the mechanism of how the independently regulated transcripts of LTBP-1S and -1L are formed. Functional analyses of their regulatory regions revealed elements affecting their constitutive and cell-type specific transcription, including differential regulation in transformed cells compared with normal cells. We, furthermore, determined the transcriptional responses of these genes to TGF-β1 and certain other growth factors, and mapped the chromosomal localization of the LTBP-1 gene by fluorescence in situ hybridization to region 2p22–24. Thermostable AmpliTaq polymerase was from Perkin-Elmer (Branschburg, NJ) and SuperScript II RNase H-Reverse Transcriptase from Life Technologies (Gaithersburg, MD). All the DNA modifying enzymes were purchased from New England Biolabs (Beverly, MA). Reagents for dideoxy sequencing and radioactive labels were from Amersham Pharmacia Biotech (Uppsala, Sweden). Human EGF was obtained from Sigma. Human hepatocyte growth factor, human vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), and human basic fibroblast growth factor were purchased from R&D Systems (Minneapolis, MN). Recombinant human small latent TGF-β1 was a gift from Dr. P. Puolakkainen (Oncogen, Seattle, WA). Genome Walker Kit (CLONTECH, Palo Alto, CA) was used to identify the upstream region ofLTBP-1S. Two nested gene-specific primers corresponding to nucleotides from +182 to +214 and +156 to +185 of humanLTBP-1S cDNA (GenBank accession number M34057) were used together with kit adapter primers in amplifying the gene upstream region by nested polymerase chain reactions. Nested PCR reactions were performed for 35 cycles using 4-min extension times, otherwise following the manufacturer's instructions. Amplification products from differentially restricted genomic DNA pools were cloned into pGEM-T cloning vector (Promega Corp., Madison, WI) and used as templates in DNA sequencing. Sequencing was performed in both directions by an ALFexpress automated sequencer (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). An additional upstream region of LTBP-1S was obtained by using adapter primers of the kit and another set of nested gene-specific oligonucleotides designed based on the sequence obtained from the first amplification. The primer sequences were: 5′-TGCATTCCACGTATCAAGTGGTCGTGTAACCTCTACTTG-3′ and 5′-CTCTAGTGACGGGCAGCTCATTACCCACAAAAGCA-3′. Nested PCR reactions, cloning, and sequencing were performed as before. Genomic DNA for human LTBP-1L was cloned from λ FIX II human placenta genomic library (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA). The library was screened using a polymerase chain reaction-derived probe corresponding to nucleotides from +1 to +307 of humanLTBP-1L cDNA (GenBank™ accession numberL48925). The probe was labeled with [α-32P]dCTP using the random priming kit (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) and hybridized to filters in 5 × SSPE, 50% formamide, 5 × Denhardt's, 0.25% sodium dodecyl sulfate at 42 °C overnight. λ DNA from positive clones were extracted and cloned into pBluescript II KS(+) cloning vector (Stratagene) as a NotI restriction fragment. A restriction map of the desired clone was built up by digesting the clone with single cutters of the multiple cloning site of pBluescript II KS(+) and detecting specific fragments by Southern blotting. A shorter 8.4-kb SacI restriction fragment including the 5′-flanking region of LTBP-1L was further subcloned into pBluescript II KS(+) and sequenced as described forLTBP-1S. Primer extending from +1 to +24 nucleotides relative to the translation start site of LTBP-1S was end-labeled with [γ-32P]ATP using T4 polynucleotide kinase. Total RNA from WI-38 human embryonic lung fibroblasts (CCL-75, American Type Culture Collection, Rockville, MD) was extracted using a commercial RNeasy Kit (Qiagen, Hilden, Germany). 20 μg of total RNA and 200 fmol of the end-labeled oligonucleotide were mixed and denatured at 70 °C for 10 min. The oligonucleotide was then extended with SuperScript II RNase H-reverse transcriptase at 48 °C for 50 min. The extension products were separated by an 8% denaturing urea polyacrylamide gel. Their sizes were determined by comparison with sequencing ladders obtained from dideoxy sequencing ofLTBP-1S using the same primer as in the primer extension reaction. The 5′-end ofLTBP-1L transcript was determined by ribonuclease protection analysis following the instructions of a commercial RPA III kit (Ambion Inc., Austin, TX). AscI-AgeI andPvuII-DraI fragments of the upstream region ofLTBP-1L spanning nucleotides from −513 to −21 and from −398 to −163, respectively, relative to the translation initiation site of LTBP-1L, were cloned into pGEM-7Zf vector (Promega), which contains the recognition site of T7 polymerase. The plasmids were further linearized and antisense RNA probes were synthesized with T7 RNA polymerase in the presence of [α-32P]UTP. Messenger RNA from WI-38 cells was extracted using Oligotext Direct mRNA Midi Kit (Qiagen), and 0.6 μg of mRNA was hybridized with the appropriate antisense RNA probe. Following hybridization overnight, unpaired, single-stranded probes were digested with RNase A/RNase T1 Mix and the samples were subsequently precipitated. Protected fragments were analyzed in a denaturing 6% polyacrylamide gel and their sizes were determined by comparing with M13 phage sequencing ladder. The genome walking amplification product, which contained the 5′-flanking region ofLTBP-1S, was transferred from pGEM-T cloning vector to pGL3 basic luciferase reporter gene plasmid (Promega) by first subcloning it to pBluescript II KS(+). The fragment was cloned using EcoRI and SacI restriction endonucleases, which recognize the vector polylinkers. The 3′-region of the fragment, which contained the coding sequences of LTBP-1S, was subsequently replaced with a polymerase chain reaction-derived product corresponding to nucleotides from −1339 to −1 relative to the translation start site of LTBP-1S. Finally the fragment covering only the upstream region of LTBP-1S was moved from pBluescript II KS(+) to pGL3 basic reporter vector by digesting the vector polylinkers withXhoI and SacI restriction endonucleases. The construct was named “L-1S PROM.” Four 5′-deletion constructs of L-1S PROM were generated by double digestion with EcoRI, which recognizes a sequence in the vector polylinker, and with the indicated restriction endonucleases followed by blunt end religation. Starting from position −1 relative to the translation initiation codon of LTBP-1S “L-1SΔMscI” construct contained 1375 bp, “L-1SΔBsmBI” 977 bp, “L-1SΔPvuII” 520 bp, and “L-1SΔBlpI” 163 bp of the upstream region of LTBP-1S (Fig. 5). An internal deletion to the L-1S PROM construct was generated by digesting it with BsmBI and PvuII endonucleases and religating blunted ends. The construct was named “L-1SΔBsmBI-PvuII.” “L-1S/L PacI-SacI” construct was built by ligating aPacI-SacI restriction fragment from the upstream region of LTBP-1L to the recognition site ofEcoRI in the upstream region of the “L-1S PROM” constuct (Fig. 5 A). “L-1S PROM REV” reporter plasmid containing the upstream region of LTBP-1S in reverse orientation was constructed by inverting the insert using NotI andBglII restriction endonucleases. The LTBP-1L 5′-flanking region was cloned into pGL3 basic by first moving the entire 8.4-kb SacI restriction fragment from pBluescript II KS(+) to pGL3 basic reporter plasmid. In order to include the outmost 3′-end of the LTBP-1L upstream region, a large 3′-region, which contained the coding sequences of LTBP-1L was replaced with an AgeI-Bsp102I fragment of the upstream region of LTBP-1L. The fragment corresponds to nucleotides from −25 to −5 relative to its translation start site (Fig. 1 B). Several 5′-deletion constructs of this 2265-bp construct named L-1L PROM were further generated by digestions with the following enzymes and blunt end religation. “L-1LΔPacI” construct, which is 1465 bp in size, was made by using SacI, which recognizes a sequence in the vector polylinker, and PacI restriction endonucleases. “L-1LΔKpnI” (851 bp) was constructed by usingKpnI, which has recognition sites in both the vector and the gene upstream region. “L-1LΔAatI” (457 bp) and “L-1LΔPvuII” (161 bp) constructs were generated by double digesting with KpnI together with AatI orPvuII restriction endonucleases (Fig. 6). In addition, a reporter plasmid containing the 2265-bp upstream region ofLTBP-1L in reverse orientation was constructed usingKpnI and XhoI restriction endonucleases. The ends of all the constructs were finally sequenced using universal primers of the pGL3 basic vector.Figure 6Deletion analyses of the 5′-flanking region of LTBP-1L reveal a presence of a negative regulatory element. A, WI-38 human embryonic fibroblasts orB, SV-40 virus-transformed WI-38/VA13 human embryonic fibroblasts were transiently transfected with luciferase reporter gene constructs of LTBP-1L, which are schematically shown in the figure. The symbols used are the same as forLTBP-1S in Fig. 5. Normalized luciferase activities (mean ± S.E.) are presented as percentage of L-1L PROM constructs.

Human amniotic (HA) epithelial cells were isolated as described (33Valle M. Penttinen K. Ann. Med. Exp. Biol. Fenn. 1962; 40: 342-351PubMed Google Scholar) and maintained in medium 199 supplemented with 5% fetal calf serum, 0.1% glucose, 100 IU/ml penicillin, and 50 μg/ml streptomycin. Amnion cells were used as second passages of the primary cultures. Cells to be transfected were cultured in 35-mm diameter plates. Upon reaching 50–80% confluence WI-38, WI-38/VA13, and HA cells were co-transfected with the total 3 μg of each construct plasmid and pRL-TK control plasmid using FuGENE 6 transfection reagent (Roche Molecular Biochemicals, Mannheim, Germany) according to the manufacturer's instructions. HT-1080 cells were rinsed twice with serum and antibiotic-free Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium and transfected similarly using LipofectAMINE transfection reagent (Life Technologies, Inc.). The pRL-TK plasmid contains the Renillaluciferase gene of seapansy under control of the constitutively expressed tymidine kinase promoter, and is used in dual luciferase assays to normalize the transfection efficiency. After 24 h the following concentrations of growth factors were added to WI-38 fibroblasts under serum-free conditions: TGF-β1 (5 ng/ml), hepatocyte growth factor (20 ng/ml), basic fibroblast growth factor (20 ng/ml), EGF (30 ng/ml), or VEGF (50 ng/ml). Subsequently, 48 h after transfection, the cells were washed twice with phosphate-buffered saline (0.14 m NaCl, 10 mm sodium phosphate buffer, pH 7.4) and lysed with 500 μl of Passive Lysis Buffer (Dual Luciferase Kit, Promega). Finally, 20 μl of the lysates were subjected for activity measurements by using a Dual Luciferase Kit (Promega) and Digene DCR-1 luminometer (MGM Instruments, Inc., Hamden, CT). Human amniotic epithelial cells, WI-38 lung fibroblasts, SV-40 WI-38/VA13 virus-transformed fibroblasts, and HT-1080 osteosarcoma cells were cultured in 100-cm2 flasks to 70% confluence. For growth factor induction WI-38 cells were washed several times by serum-free medium. Subsequently TGF-β1 (5 ng/ml) was added to cells and incubated for 24 h under serum-free conditions. Total RNA was extracted from all the cell lines by the commercial RNeasy kit (Qiagen) following the manufacturer's instructions. For Northern hybridization analysis 10 μg of total RNA was electrophoresed on a 0.8% formaldehyde-agarose gel and transferred to Hybond-N nylon filter (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) in 20 × SSC. A probe for hybridizations corresponding to nucleotides from +1756 to +2593 of human LTBP-1S cDNA was radioactively labeled with [α-32P]dCTP. The hybridizations were performed using Express Hyb hybridization solution (CLONTECH) according to the manufacturer's instructions and the filters were washed under high stringency conditions followed by autoradiography. Similar hybridizations were performed with radioactively labeled glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase cDNA probe. A polymerase chain reaction-derived fragment corresponding to bases from +91 to +1389 of human LTBP-1S cDNA was used as a probe in selecting human genomic PAC clone (Genome Systems Inc., St. Louis, MO). The obtained PAC clones were verified by polymerase chain reaction using oligonucleotides specific for LTBP-1S. The probes for hybridization were prepared by nick translation using the PAC clones as templates and biotin-l4-dATP as a label. Human lymphocyte metaphase spreads were treated with pepsin (0.2 mg/ml in 0.01 m HCl) at 37 °C for 10 min. Chromosomes were denatured in 70% formamide, 2 × SSC, pH 7.0, at 64 °C for 2 min. Hybridization signals from preparations were detected by indirect immunofluorescence using avidin-tetramethylrhodamine isothiocyanate. The slides were counterstained with 4,6′-diamidino-2-phenylindole. Fluorescent signals were analyzed by an Olympus (Tokyo, Japan) fluorescence microscope equipped with an ISIS digital image analysis system (MetaSystems GmbH, Altlussheim, Germany). The chromosome identity was confirmed by chromosome-specific painting following the instructions of the manufacturer (Cambio, Cambridge, United Kingdom). The genomic upstream region of LTBP-1S was amplified by nested polymerase chain reaction using the Genome Walker Kit and oligonucleotides designed based on LTBP-1S cDNA. The amplification products obtained from differentially restricted genomic DNA pools of the kit were cloned into pGEM-T cloning vector for sequencing. Sequencing of five overlapping clones of the 5′-flanking region of LTBP-1S resulted in a sequence of 1.75 kb upstream from its translation initiation site (Figs.1, A and B). An additional 0.5-kb sequence further toward the 5′-flanking region was amplified by another nested PCR reaction using oligonucleotides complementary to part of the sequence obtained from the first PCR reaction. The genomic clones contained also the nucleotide sequence surrounding a previously reported splice site of the NH2-terminal extended form, LTBP-1L (27Olofsson A. Ichijo H. Moren A. ten Dijke P. Miyazono K. Heldin C.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 31294-31297Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). Sequencing of the alternative splice site from the genomic clones revealed that theLTBP-1L transcript is generated by using an intraexonic splice acceptor site in the first exon of LTBP-1S. Therefore, the genomic region upstream from the alternative splice site functions as part of the first exon forLTBP-1S and as an intron for LTBP-1L (see Fig. 9). Screening of λ FIX II human placenta genomic library with a PCR-derived probe corresponding to bases from +1 to +307 ofLTBP-1L cDNA resulted in several positive phage clones. A clone named CL 6.9, which contained the upstream region ofLTBP-1L, was further characterized by Southern blotting (Fig. 2 A). An 8.4-kbSacI restriction fragment of CL 6.9 was subcloned into pBluescript KS II(+) vector and used as a template in automated sequencing. The subclone was found to contain 2.3 kb ofLTBP-1L upstream region (Fig. 2, A andB). Primer extension studies were performed in order to determine the exact transcription initiation codon ofLTBP-1S. We localized the transcription initiation site by using an end-labeled oligonucleotide, which extended from +1 to +24 nucleotides relative to the translation initiation site. Two clear extension products, 64 and 102 bp in size, were detected when total RNA from WI-38 human embryonic lung fibroblasts was used as template (Fig.3 A). According to these extension products the transcription initiation sites ofLTBP-1S are situated at −40 and −88 bp relative to its translation initiation codon. Ribonuclease protection assay was used to determine the nucleotide sequence of the 5′-end of the LTBP-1L transcript since the attempts using primer extension analysis were not successful. Two antisense riboprobes spanning from nucleotide −513 to −22 and −398 to −163 relative to the trans"

Their universal presence in all cells suggests a fundamental role in membrane traffic. SCAMPs are particularly highly expressed in organelles that undergo regulated exocytosis, such as synaptic vesicles and mast cell granules. Of the three currently known SCAMPs, SCAMP1 is the most abundant. To investigate the possible functions of SCAMP1, we generated mice that lack SCAMP1. SCAMP1-deficient mice are viable and fertile. They exhibit no changes in the overall architecture or the protein composition of the brain or alterations in peripheral organs. Capacitance measurements in mast cells demonstrated that exocytosis could be triggered reliably by GTPγS in SCAMP1-deficient cells. The initial overall capacitance of mast cells was similar between wild type and mutant mice, but the final cell capacitance after completion of exocytosis, was significantly smaller in SCAMP1-deficient cells than in wild type cells. Furthermore, there was an increased proportion of reversible fusion events, which may have caused the decrease in the overall capacitance change observed after exocytosis. Our data show that SCAMP1 is not essential for exocytosis, as such, and does not determine the stability or size of secretory vesicles, but is required for the full execution of stable exocytosis in mast cells. This phenotype could be the result of a function of SCAMP1 in the formation of stable fusion pores during exocytosis or of a role of SCAMP1 in the regulation of endocytosis after formation of fusion pores.

EMBO J. 1993; 12: 3753-3761Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). Only one of the three SCAMPs, SCAMP1, appears to be present at high levels on synaptic vesicles that lack SCAMPs 2 and 3 (Refs. 1Brand S.H. Laurie S.M. Mixon M.B. Castle J.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 18949-18957Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar and2Brand S.H. Castle J.D. EMBO J. 1993; 12: 3753-3761Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar and footnote 2). The function of SCAMPs are unknown. Their ubiquitous presence in transport vesicles in all cells indicates a fundamental role in membrane traffic. The enrichment of SCAMPs in secretory vesicles that are subject to regulated exocytosis followed by rapid endocytosis suggests a function in exo- or endocytosis. Interestingly, SCAMP1 and SCAMP3 are tyrosine-phosphorylated in vivo by the epidermal growth factor receptor tyrosine kinase (9Wu T.T. Castle J.D. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1998; 9: 1661-1674Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar); this result indicates that SCAMPs may be targets of intracellular signal transduction pathways. To gain insight into the functions of SCAMPs, we have used homologous recombination to abolish SCAMP1 expression in mice. Surprisingly, SCAMP1-deficient mice were viable and fertile. The knockout mice exhibited no major nervous system phenotypes despite the fact that SCAMP1 is the major, and possibly only, SCAMP isoform on synaptic vesicles. Furthermore, capacitance recordings in mast cells that normally express copious amounts of SCAMP1 (10Guo Z. Turner C. Castle J.D. Cell. 1998; 94: 537-548Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (227) Google Scholar) revealed that SCAMP1 is not essential for the generation or maintenance of normally sized secretory vesicles nor is it required for exo- or endocytosis as such. The only phenotype observed was a change in the total amount of stable membrane fusion that could be triggered by GTPγS and in the frequency of reversible fusion events in SCAMP1-deficient mast cells during exocytosis. A mouse genomic library (λ-FIX, Stratagene) was screened with a uniformly32P-labeled probe from the rat SCAMP1 cDNA (1Brand S.H. Laurie S.M. Mixon M.B. Castle J.D. J. Biol.

Mapping and sequencing revealed that one genomic clone (pmLSCAMP1–4) subcloned into pBluescript contained exons 3–5 from the N-terminal coding region of SCAMP 1. Exon numbers were identified by comparison with the published pig SCAMP1 gene (see Fig. 1 A and Ref.13Wen G. Leeb T. Hui D. Baumgartner B.G. Robic A. Hameister H. Brenig B. Mamm. Genome. 1998; 9: 536-539Crossref PubMed Scopus (6) Google Scholar). A targeting vector was designed to delete exons 3 and 4 (residues 46–114 of SCAMP1). The vector contained neomycin resistance and diphtheria toxin gene cassettes as positive and negative selectable markers, respectively (Fig. 1 A). ES cells (SM1 cells from Sv/129 mice) were cultured on irradiated STO cells and electroporated with NotI-linearized targeting vector as described (12Rosahl T.W. Spillane D. Missler M. Herz J.

After selection with 0.19 g/liter G418, resistant clones were picked, expanded, and analyzed by Southern blotting of genomic DNA digested with EcoRI, BamHI, or XbaI with an 0.57-kb NotI-PstI fragment from the 5′-end of pmLSCAMP1–4 as an outside probe to detect homologous recombination (Fig. 1). Polymerase chain reaction genotyping was performed in a single tube with three oligonucleotides.

Chimeric mice derived from one ES cell clone transmitted the mutant gene through the germline; resulting offspring were used for all further studies.

A GST-fusion protein containing the entire N-terminal cytoplasmic sequence of SCAMP1 (encoded by pGEX-SCAMP1) was used to generate a SCAMP1-specific antibody (R806) that did not react with SCAMP2 and SCAMP3 and was expressed in transfected COS cells (data not shown). Immunoblotting of total brain homogenates from wild type and mutant mice was carried out as described (16Johnston P.A. Jahn R. Südhof T.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 1268-1273Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar); signals were detected by125I-labeled secondary antibodies. Immunocytochemical analysis was performed on cryostat brain sections from perfusion-fixed adult mice and developed using the peroxidase-antiperoxidase technique and heavy metal enhancement (12Rosahl T.W.

Mast cells were obtained essentially as described (17Alvarez de Toledo G. Fernandez-Chacon R. Fernandez J.M. Nature. 1993; 363: 554-558Crossref PubMed Scopus (530) Google Scholar, 18Fernandez-Chacon R. Alvarez de Toledo G. FEBS Lett. 1995; 363: 221-225Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar) from wild type and SCAMP1 knockout mice by peritoneal lavage with buffer A containing (in millimolar; pH 7.2): 140 NaCl, 10 HEPES-NaOH, 2 CaCl2, 1 MgCl2, 6 glucose, 45 NaHCO3, and 0.4 sodium phosphate. For immunofluorescence analysis, mast cells were fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde, 0.1m phosphate buffer, and 0.12 m sucrose for 20 min and permeabilized with 0.3% Triton X-100 in phosphate-buffered saline for 10 min. Blocking reaction and incubations with primary SCAMP1 antibody and secondary Cy-3-labeled antibody (from Jackson ImmunoResearch) were performed in 3% goat serum. For electrophysiological analysis (17Alvarez de Toledo G. Fernandez-Chacon R. Fernandez J.M. Nature. 1993; 363: 554-558Crossref PubMed Scopus (530) Google Scholar, 18Fernandez-Chacon R. Alvarez de Toledo G. FEBS Lett. 1995; 363: 221-225Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar), cells were plated on coverslips and incubated in an atmosphere of 5% CO2, 95% air until use (between 1 and 8 h after culture). All experiments were performed at room temperature in buffer A without NaHCO3; glucose was added to adjust the osmolarity to 310 mosmol/kg. Patch pipette solutions contained (in millimolar): 140 potassium glutamate, 10 HEPES, 7 MgCl2, 3 KOH, 0.2 Mg-ATP, 2.5 K2-EGTA, and 7.5 Ca2+-EGTA. The final Ca2+ concentration was between 500 and 900 nm. We added 5–10 μm GTPγS to the pipette solution to induce degranulation. Membrane capacitance was measured by whole cell recordings (19Hamill O.P. Marty A. Neher E. Sakmann B. Sigworth F.J. Pflügers Arch. 1981; 391: 85-100Crossref PubMed Scopus (15174) Google Scholar). The C-slow and G-series potentiometers of an EPC-7 (Heka Electronics) patch clamp amplifier were used to cancel out the incoming membrane current in order to resolve small capacitance changes. Direct readout of these knobs gave us the approximations for the initial and final cell membrane capacitance and series conductance of every cell. We obtained a calibration signal by unbalancing the C-slow potentiometer by 100 fF, corresponding to a change of 10 μm2 (assuming a specific membrane capacitance of 1 μF/cm2 of membrane). The V-command was a 50-mV sine wave (root mean square, 1 kHz). Capacitance and conductance values were estimated from the real and imaginary components of the complex admittance, which was obtained by a Lock-In amplifier (SR-830, Stanford Research) (20Lindau M. Q. Rev. Biophys. 1991; 24: 75-101Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). We set the phase manually at the beginning of each recording. Data acquisition was done using an IDA 15125 board (INDEC Systems) programmed in Visual Basic. One data point was obtained every 2.5 ms. Data analysis was done with IGOR Pro 3.13 (Wavemetrics). Vesicle radii were calculated assuming that a vesicle is spherical and its specific membrane capacitance is 1 μF/cm2. Statistical significance was tested using PRISM software with a two-tailed nonparametric Mann-Whitney test. To construct a targeting vector for homologous recombination of the SCAMP1 gene in mice, we first cloned genomic sequences containing exons that encode the N terminus of SCAMP1. We isolated one genomic clone that contained three N-terminal exons. The exon-intron structure observed in the murine SCAMP1 clone was the same as that recently described for the pig SCAMP1 gene (13Wen G. Leeb T. Hui D. Baumgartner B.G. Robic A. Hameister H. Brenig B. Mamm. Genome. 1998; 9: 536-539Crossref PubMed Scopus (6) Google Scholar), allowing us to identify the exons as exons 3, 4, and 5 (Fig.1 A). Using the SCAMP1 genomic clone, we then constructed a targeting vector in which the genomic sequences that contain exons 3 and 4 are replaced by a neomycin resistance gene cassette as a positive selectable marker. The neomycin cassette is flanked by short and long arms to allow for efficient recombination. The short arm in turn is flanked by a diphtheria toxin expression cassette as a negative selectable marker. The vector design predicts that homologous recombination should lead to a loss of the diphtheria toxin expression, a gain of neomycin resistance, and a deletion of exons 3 and 4. As a result, homologous recombination should remove residues 46–144 of SCAMP1. In addition, if exon 2 were spliced to exon 5 after homologous recombination, an out-of-frame junction in the mRNA would occur that should also abolish SCAMP1 expression. We electroporated the targeting vector into ES cells and selected resistant clones with neomycin. Southern blotting analysis showed that 2.5% of the resistant clones were the result of homologous recombination (Fig. 1 B). One of several clones injected into blastocysts gave rise to highly chimeric mice that transmitted the SCAMP1 mutation through the germline. The resulting heterozygous mice were bred to homozygosity and analyzed by a number of techniques. Unexpectedly, we found that mice homozygous for the SCAMP1 mutation were viable and fertile. Matings between heterozygotes produced offspring with a normal Mendelian distribution of the mutant allele (data not shown). No increased morbidity was observed after prolonged periods of observation; even homozygous mutant mice 18 months of age exhibited no disease symptoms or increased mortality. These experiments demonstrate that SCAMP1 is not an essential gene. Considering the fact that SCAMP1 is the major SCAMP isoform, and the only currently known isoform on synaptic vesicles, the absence of a major phenotype in the SCAMP1-knockout mice was surprising. It raised the possibility that homologous recombination may have occurred in a pseudogene or resulted in a gene duplication that does not ablate expression. To test for this possibility, we analyzed brain proteins from wild type and mutant mice by immunoblotting. Using a general SCAMP monoclonal antibody and a SCAMP1-specific polyclonal antibody, we detected no SCAMP1 in the homozygous mutant and found reduced SCAMP1 protein levels in the heterozygotes (Fig. 2). Thus, the mutation we introduced is effectively a null mutation. The SCAMP monoclonal antibody reacts weakly with other SCAMP isoforms in addition to SCAMP1 (1Brand S.H. Laurie S.M. Mixon M.B. Castle J.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 18949-18957Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 2Brand S.H. Castle J.D. EMBO J. 1993; 12: 3753-3761Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar, 3Singleton D.R. Wu T.T. Castle J.D. J. Cell Sci. 1997; 110: 2099-2107Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Analysis of the knockout mice shows, however, that these other SCAMP isoforms, which appear to be less abundant than SCAMP1, are unchanged in the knockout mice, suggesting that there is no compensatory change in these isoforms (arrowheads in the top panel in Fig. 2). We then studied another series of synaptic proteins in the same samples. No major change in any of these proteins was uncovered (Fig. 2 and data not shown). In particular, the levels of an array of synaptic vesicle proteins (synaptophysin, synaptoporin, synaptotagmin, synaptobrevin, rabphilin, synapsins, Rab3s) exhibited no obvious alteration, nor were there changes in a cytosolic presynaptic protein (complexin) or postsynaptic N-methyl-d-aspartic acid receptors. These results indicate that deleting SCAMP1 does not induce major aberrations in the brain. To confirm this conclusion by an independent method, we performed immunocytochemistry experiments with sections of the hippocampus from wild type and homozygous SCAMP1 mutant mice. Sections were probed with antibodies to SCAMP1 and to synaptoporin (data not shown). When we compared the SCAMP1 staining patterns between wild type and SCAMP1 knockout mice, we found no SCAMP1 expression in the knockout mice, as expected. A comparison of the synaptoporin staining patterns, however, showed that the distribution of synaptoporin was indistinguishable between wild type and SCAMP1 knockout mice (data not shown). The synaptic vesicle protein synaptoporin is an isoform of synaptophysin that is highly concentrated in mossy fiber terminals of the CA3 region (21Fykse E.M. Takei K. Walch-Solimena C. Geppert M. Jahn R. De Camilli P. Südhof T.C. J. Neurosci. 1993; 13: 4997-5007Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). It is therefore a marker that is sensitive to changes in the structural organization of the hippocampus. The absence of changes in the structure of the hippocampus or in the levels in major synaptic proteins indicates that the SCAMP1 knockout does not lead to a reorganization of the brain architecture. Mast cells are specialized secretory cells with large exocytotic granules and high levels of SCAMP1 (10Guo Z. Turner C. Castle J.D. Cell. 1998; 94: 537-548Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (227) Google Scholar). Mast cells have been very useful in electrophysiological studies in which membrane traffic is measured by capacitance changes (17Alvarez de Toledo G. Fernandez-Chacon R. Fernandez J.M.

A. 1996; 93: 14349-14354Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). Immunocytochemical staining of peritoneal mast cells from wild type and SCAMP1 knockout mice with antibodies to SCAMP1 confirmed that SCAMP1 is enriched in the secretory granules of mast cells and is absent from the knockout animals (data not shown). Nevertheless, the SCAMP1-deficient mast cells had a normal appearance with no major changes in the distribution or sizes of secretory granules as judged by Normarski optics. To determine whether the SCAMP1 deficiency induced a functional defect in mast cell exo- and/or endocytosis, we performed capacitance measurements in SCAMP1-deficient mast cells by patch clamp electrophysiology (Fig. 3). As a control, we used mast cells from wild type littermates that have the same genetic background. Capacitance recordings allow monitoring of exo- and endocytosis in real time. In addition, the size of the granules and the kinetics of fusion can be determined by capacitance measurements in mast cells because of the large size of their secretory granules. Using capacitance recordings, we found that GTPγS triggered exocytosis in SCAMP1-deficient mast cells as readily as in wild type mast cells (Fig.3). In cells of both genotypes, capacitance changes occurred in discrete steps, which are thought to correspond in size to a single secretory granule (23Almers W. Neher E. J. Physiol. (London). 1987; 386: 205-217Crossref Scopus (58) Google Scholar, 24Monck J.R. Alvarez de Toledo G. Fernandez J.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 7804-7808Crossref PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar, 25Alvarez de Toledo G. Fernandez J.M. J. Cell Biol. 1990; 110: 1033-1039Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar, 26Lindau M. Gomperts B.D. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1991; 1071: 429-471Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). The average size of the individual capacitance steps was slightly but not significantly smaller in the knockout cells than in wild type cells. Accordingly, the radius of the secretory granules calculated from these measurements was similar between wild type and mutant cells (see Fig. 3,C–F). These data show that mast cells lacking SCAMP1 contain normally sized secretory granules that are fusion competent. We next quantified the overall capacitance changes that could be triggered by GTPγS in wild type and knockout mast cells. Cells with or without SCAMP1 exhibited a similar overall initial capacitance (Fig.4 A). Interestingly, however, the final capacitance was significantly different between wild type and knockout cells (Fig. 4 B). Inspection of the capacitance traces indicated that there may be an increase in the frequency of reversible exocytosis in the knockout mice (asterisks in Fig.3 A). These reversible fusion events probably reflect transient fusion reactions (17Alvarez de Toledo G. Fernandez-Chacon R. Fernandez J.M. Nature. 1993; 363: 554-558Crossref PubMed Scopus (530) Google Scholar) or accelerated membrane retrieval processes after exocytosis. Quantitation of the frequency of such events confirmed that the SCAMP1-deficient cells had a tendency to undergo more frequent fusion reversals, indicating that this may have contributed to the decrease in the overall capacitance change triggered by GTPγS (Fig. 4 C). SCAMP1 is the most abundant SCAMP isoform in mammals and the only currently described isoform that is present in synaptic vesicles. In the present study, we generated a null mutant for SCAMP1 and analyzed its phenotype. Probably our most remarkable observation is that mice lacking SCAMP1 exhibit relatively few changes: SCAMP1 is clearly not an essential gene, is not required for the stability or normal size of secretory vesicles, and is not needed for exo- or endocytosis as such. In view of its abundance and universal expression, the relatively mild phenotype of the SCAMP1 knockout mice is surprising. At least three hypotheses can be advanced to explain this finding. 1) SCAMP1 may be functionally redundant. Although the other two currently known SCAMP isoforms (SCAMP2 and SCAMP3) are not present in synaptic vesicles, additional SCAMPs may be expressed here and elsewhere that could be functionally redundant. 2R. Fernández-Chacón and T. C. Südhof, unpublished observation. 2) SCAMP1 may have a discrete specialized function that only becomes apparent in unusual circumstances. For example, it could be essential for particular environmental stresses that we have not tested. 3) SCAMP1 may have a very subtle, relatively unimportant function. Although rarely considered, evolutionary leftovers in the genome with relatively minor functions are conceivable. For example, even an abundant and conserved protein such as serum albumin can be deleted in humans without untoward consequences. Future studies will have to address which of these hypotheses is the most likely. Although SCAMP1 was found to be nonessential in our studies, its deletion did have phenotypic consequence for membrane traffic; we observed an increase in the frequency of reversible fusion events in mast cells and a decrease in the total capacitance change generated after stimulation of exocytosis, even though the starting capacitance was identical. This phenotype is distantly related to the phenotype observed in ruby mutant mice (27Oberhauser A.F. Fernandez J.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 14349-14354Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). It could be the result of a role for SCAMP1 in stabilizing fusion pores, a role that would agree well with the conserved transmembrane structure of SCAMPs (3Singleton D.R. Wu T.T. Castle J.D. J. Cell Sci. 1997; 110: 2099-2107Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 13Wen G. Leeb T. Hui D. Baumgartner B.G. Robic A. Hameister H. Brenig B. Mamm. Genome. 1998; 9: 536-539Crossref PubMed Scopus (6) Google Scholar). Alternatively, this phenotype could be caused by a function of SCAMP1 in the timing of endocytosis, resulting in an increase of fast endocytosis when SCAMP1 is absent. Whichever of these models for the function of SCAMP1 is correct, either invokes a role for SCAMP1 in membrane traffic at the cell surface, which agrees well with its universal presence in small transport vesicles in all cells (1Brand S.H. Laurie S.M. Mixon M.B. Castle J.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 18949-18957Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 2Brand S.H. Castle J.D.

The adult body consists of a solitary axial cell surrounded by a single layer of 10–40 ciliated outer cells.

https://openalex.org/W2028409421,"Presenilin-1 (PS-1) is the most causative Alzheimer gene product, and its function is not well understood. In an attempt to elucidate the function of PS-1, we screened a human brain cDNA library for PS-1-interacting proteins using the yeast two-hybrid system and isolated a novel protein containing a PSD-95/Dlg/ZO-1 (PDZ)-like domain. This novel PS-1-associated protein (PSAP) shares a significant similarity with a Caenorhabditis elegans protein of unknown function. Northern blot analysis revealed that PSAP is predominantly expressed in the brain. Deletion of the first four C-terminal amino acid residues of PS-1, which contain the PDZ domain-binding motif (Gln-Phe-Tyr-Ile), reduced the binding activity of PS-1 toward PSAP 4-fold. These data suggest that PS-1 may associate with a PDZ-like domain-containing protein in vivoand thus may participate in receptor or channel clustering and intracellular signaling events in the brain."

In humans, homocysteine can be metabolized in one of two ways, transsulfurated to form cysteine or remethylated to form methionine. Disturbance in either of these pathways can lead to an accumulation of homocysteine in plasma. Methylenetetrahydrofolate reductase (MTHFR)1 is a critical enzyme in the remethylation pathway. It catalyzes the formation of a methyl donor, 5-methyltetrahydrofolate (5-methyl-THF), for converting homocysteine to methionine. Human MTHFR gene has been localized to 1p36.3. It encodes a protein of 656 amino acids, with a predicted molecular mass of 74.5 kDa (3Goyette P. Sumner J.S. Milos R. Duncan A.M. Rosenblatt D.S. Matthews R.G. Rozen R. Nat. Genet. 1994; 7: 195-200Crossref PubMed Scopus (254) Google Scholar). The enzyme is a flavoprotein that utilizes NADPH as an electron donor and FAD as a cofactor in mammalian cells (5Kutzbach C. Stokstad E.L. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1971; 250: 459-477Crossref PubMed Scopus (268) Google Scholar). Human and other eukaryotic MTHFR exist as homodimers, whereas Escherichia coli MTHFR is a homotetramer (6Matthews R.G. Vanoni M.A. Hainfeld J.F. Wall J. J. Biol. Chem. 1984; 259: 11647-11650Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 7Sheppard C.A. Trimmer E.E. Matthews R.G. J. Bacteriol. 1999; 181: 718-725Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Porcine MTHFR has been shown to be allosterically inhibited byS-adenosylmethionine (AdoMet) (5Kutzbach C. Stokstad E.L. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1971; 250: 459-477Crossref PubMed Scopus (268) Google Scholar, 8Jencks D.A. Matthews R.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 2485-2493Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). This inhibition was proposed to play a role in preventing the depletion of methylenetetrahydrofolate in cells (5Kutzbach C. Stokstad E.L. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1971; 250: 459-477Crossref PubMed Scopus (268) Google Scholar). Mutations in human MTHFR are known to cause clinical MTHFR deficiency, an autosomal recessive disorder (4Engbersen A.M. Franken D.G. Boers G.H. Stevens E.M. Trijbels F.J. Blom H.J. Am. J. Hum. Genet. 1995; 56: 142-150PubMed Google Scholar). The clinical symptoms of patients with MTHFR deficiency are highly variable including developmental delay, motor and gait abnormalities, seizures, and premature vascular disease (9Rosenblatt D.S. Scriver C.R. Beaudet A.L. Sly W.S. Valle D. Inherited Disorders of Folate Transport and Metabolism. 7th Ed. McGraw-Hill Inc., New York1995: 3111-3128Google Scholar). The reductase activity from cultured fibroblasts of patients with severe MTHFR deficiency ranges from 0 to 20% of the control (10Goyette P. Frosst P. Rosenblatt D.S. Rozen R. Am. J. Hum. Genet. 1995; 56: 1052-1059PubMed Google Scholar). The severity of the disease tends to correlate with the residual MTHFR activity (9Rosenblatt D.S. Scriver C.R. Beaudet A.L. Sly W.S. Valle D. Inherited Disorders of Folate Transport and Metabolism. 7th Ed. McGraw-Hill Inc., New York1995: 3111-3128Google Scholar). Several mutant alleles of MTHFR have been identified in patients with MTHFR deficiency (10Goyette P. Frosst P. Rosenblatt D.S. Rozen R. Am. J. Hum. Genet. 1995; 56: 1052-1059PubMed Google Scholar, 11Goyette P. Christensen B. Rosenblatt D.S. Rozen R. Am. J. Hum. Genet. 1996; 59: 1268-1275PubMed Google Scholar). In addition, two common polymorphisms inMTHFR, C677T (A222V) and A1298C (E428A), have also been described (12Frosst P. Blom H.J. Milos R. Goyette P. Sheppard C.A. Matthews R.G.

The C677T variant has an allele frequency of 35% in the North American population, with about 12% of the population being homozygous and 40–45% heterozygous for the mutation (14Rozen R. Thromb. Haemostasis. 1997; 78: 523-526Crossref PubMed Scopus (284) Google Scholar). The homozygotes appear to have a slightly increased risk of coronary heart disease and of giving birth to children with neural tube defects (15van der Put N.M. Eskes T.K. Blom H.J. Q. J. Med. 1997; 90: 111-115Crossref Scopus (220) Google Scholar,16Kluijtmans L.A. Kastelein J.J. Lindemans J. Boers G.H. Heil S.G. Bruschke A.V. Jukema J.W. van den Heuvel L.P. Trijbels F.J. Boerma G.J. Verheugt F.W. Willems F. Blom H.J. Circulation. 1997; 96: 2573-2577Crossref PubMed Scopus (208) Google Scholar). The A1298C mutation has an allele frequency of 33%. Neither homozygosity nor heterozygosity of this allele is associated with high plasma homocysteine levels or lower plasma folate concentration (13van der Put N.M. Gabreels F. Stevens E.M.

However, this allele is reported to interact with the C677T allele intrans to cause reduced MTHFR activity and decreased plasma folate level, which could be a genetic risk factor for neural tube defects (13van der Put N.M. Gabreels F. Stevens E.M. Smeitink J.A. Trijbels F.J. Eskes T.K. van den Heuvel L.P. Blom H.J. Am. J. Hum.

So far human MTHFR and its mutant alleles have not been individually expressed and characterized at molecular levels. We have taken advantage of the yeast, Saccharomyces cerevisiae, as a model organism to characterize wild-type and mutant alleles ofMTHFR. This organism serves as a good model system for studying human biology because of the evolutionary conservation of human and yeast genes. Over 30% of yeast open reading frames share significant sequence similarity with known human genes, and more than 70 human cDNAs have been shown to complement yeast mutations (17Botstein D. Chervitz S.A. Cherry J.M. Science. 1997; 277: 1259-1260Crossref PubMed Scopus (282) Google Scholar). This structural and functional conservation has allowed the functional characterization of human genes in yeast and identification of mutations in human genes. Some examples of characterizing mutations and polymorphisms of human genes in yeast include p53 (18Ishioka C. Englert C. Winge P. Yan Y.X. Engelstein M. Friend S.H. Oncogene. 1999; 10: 1485-1492Google Scholar), cystathionine β-synthase (19Kim C. Gallagher P.M. Guttormsen A.B. Refsum H. Ueland P.M. Ose L. Folling I. Whitehead A.S. Tsai M.Y. Kruger W.D. Hum. Mol.

Genet. 1995; 56: 640-646PubMed Google Scholar), and the Wilson disease gene (21Forbes J.R. Cox D.W. Am. J. Hum. Genet. 1998; 63: 1663-1674Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar). In addition, yeast systems, due to their genetic tractability, have proven useful in structure-function analysis of human proteins. For example, yeast systems have been used to identify functional domains of the human melatonin receptor (22Kokkola T. Watson M.A. White J. Dowell S. Foord S.M. Laitinen J.T. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1998; 249: 531-536Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar), p53 (18Ishioka C. Englert C. Winge P. Yan Y.X. Engelstein M. Friend S.H. Oncogene. 1999; 10: 1485-1492Google Scholar), and cystathionine β-synthase (23Shan X. Kruger W.D. Nat. Genet. 1998; 19: 91-93Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar). In this paper we describe the development of a yeast system for functionally and structurally characterizing human MTHFR, and we show the utility of the yeast system in both mutation analysis and structure-function analysis. E. coli strain XL-1 Blue was used for all DNA manipulations. Yeast strains used were as follows: W303-1A, Mata, ade2-1, can1-100, ura3-1, leu2-3, 112, trp1-1, his3-11,15 and XSY3-1A, Mat a, ade2-1, can1-100, ura3-1, leu2-3,112, trp1-1, his3-11,15, met11Δ::TRP1. Media preparation and bacterial and yeast transformation were done according to standard procedures (24Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. 2nd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar, 25Sherman F. Hicks J.B. Fink G.R. Methods of Yeast Genetics. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1986Google Scholar, 26Ito H. Fukuda Y. Murata K. Kimura A. J. Bacteriol. 1983; 153: 163-168Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Human MTHFR cDNA was obtained from a human cDNA library (27Schild D. Brake A.J. Kiefer M.C. Young D. Barr P.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 2916-2920Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar) by PCR amplifications using Klentaq (CLONTECH). The final PCR product containing the entire coding region of MTHFR was ligated to PCR 2.1 (Invitrogen). The amplified cDNA carries the common C677T mutation. An XhoI/KpnI (about 1.8 kb) fragment containing the entire MTHFR coding region from phMV2.1 was isolated and ligated toSalI/KpnI-digested pBBP-GAL (28Xue Z. Shan X. Sinelnikov A. Melese T. Genetics. 1996; 144: 979-989Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). This generates a plasmid carrying the 5′ end HA (hemagglutinin A) epitope-tagged MTHFR open reading frame under the control of the inducible yeastGAL1 promoter and the yeast URA3 gene as a selectable marker. The C677T mutation in phMV2.1 was reverted to wild-type (C-677) by site-directed mutagenesis using the Transformer Mutagenesis kit (CLONTECH). A 20-bp oligonucleotide with the altered base in the middle was used as the mutagenic primer. The resulting plasmid, phMA2.1, was digested with KpnI andXhoI, and a 1.8-kb DNA fragment containing wild-type MTHFR cDNA (C677) was gel-purified. To incorporate the wild-type cDNA into the expression plasmid, the yeast gap repair technique was used. A 1.8-kb DNA fragment from phMA2.1 was co-transformed into XSY3–1A strain with an SmaI (partial)/EcoNI-linearized pC677T with a region containing T677 being removed. The transformants carry a gap repaired phMTHFR identical to pC677T except C-677 (wild-type). These plasmids were generated using the same strategy as above. Essentially, phMV2.1 was mutated at the desired positions by site-directed mutagenesis. The mutagenic primers are all 20-mers with the altered nucleotide in the middle. The final products were sequenced to confirm the incorporation of the mutations. These plasmids were then digested with XhoI andKpnI. The 1.8-kb fragments containing various mutations were isolated and ligated to SalI/KpnI-digested pBBP-GAL (28Xue Z. Shan X. Sinelnikov A. Melese T. Genetics. 1996; 144: 979-989Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). These plasmids express HA-tagged MTHFRvariants from the yeast GAL1 promoter. These two plasmids were generated through PCR mutagenesis. Briefly, for pA1298C, primer sets 5′-GCCATGGTGAACGAAGCCAGAGGAA (forward)/5′-AAAGACACTTGCTTCACTGG (reverse) and 5′-CCAGTGAAGCAAGTGTCTTT (forward)/5′-TCATGGAGCCTCCGTTTCTCTCGC (reverse) were used to generate two PCR fragments containing A1298C mutation. These two fragments were than co-transformed with a linearized gap repair vector into XSY3–1A. The gap repair vector is essentially identical with phMTHFR except most of the MTHFR coding region has been removed. The yeast transformants carry the pA1298C plasmid. This plasmid put the HA-tagged A1298C allele under the control of the yeastGAL1 promoter. pG458T was constructed the same way. Only two PCR primers containing the G458T mutation were used. This plasmid was constructed to express the N-terminal MTHFR. A DNA fragment encoding the N terminus was amplified by PCR using primers 5′-GCCATGGTGAACGAAGCCAGAGGAA (forward) and 5′-GAAGTCATTGTCCACCAGGTTCAGGGGTAGGGGACGCCTGA (reverse). The reverse primer contains a point mutation, G1059A, that changes a Trp codon to an OPA. This DNA fragment was used to gap repair as above. The resulting yeast transformants carry plasmids that express HA-tagged N-terminal MTHFR under the control of the yeast GAL1promoter. The chromosomal copy of MET11 in strain W303-1A was disrupted using the one-step gene disruption method (29Rothstein R. Methods Enzymol. 1991; 194: 281-301Crossref PubMed Scopus (1093) Google Scholar). The DNA fragment used for disruption was generated by the fusion PCR (30Amberg D.C. Botstein D. Beasley E.M. Yeast. 1995; 11: 1275-1280Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar). In this fragment, 200 bp of 3′ and 5′ MET11 flanking regions were fused to the yeast TRP1 gene at each end. Briefly, a PCR fragment was generated that contained the 5′-flanking region ofMET11 plus 20 bp at the 3′ end homologous to the 5′ end of the yeast TRP1 gene. Another PCR fragment containing the 3′-flanking region and 20 bp at the 5′ end complementary to the 3′ end of the TRP1 was also generated. These two DNA fragments and the TRP1 gene were connected by PCR. PCR primers for the 5′-flanking region were 5′-CACCGTACGTGAGCACATG (forward) and 5′-GTCGTGACTGGGAAAACCCTGGCGCTGTGGTGGTTCTGTTTGC T (reverse). For the 3′-flanking region, the primers were 5′-TCCTGTGTGAAATTGTTA TCCGCTCACAG (forward) and 5′-TTTCTGAATTGGATGAGTAC (reverse). The fusion PCR product was gel-purified and transformed into W303–1A. Ten Trp+ transformants were obtained, and their chromosomal DNA was isolated for PCR analysis to verify thatTRP1 gene was integrated into the MET11 locus. One of the ten transformants was confirmed to bemet11Δ::TRP1 (TRP1integrated at MET11 locus). This strain, XSY3-1A, was used for complementation studies. To test for growth, yeast cells were inoculated on SD-Met-Ura plates and SG-Met-Ura plates. The plates were then incubated at 30 °C for 3–4 days. For growth curve measurement, yeast cells were inoculated into SG-Met-Ura liquid media and incubated at 30 °C overnight. The cultures were diluted to about 0.1 × 107 cells/ml the next day. The number of cells in 1 ml of media was counted using a hemocytometer every 2 h. Yeast extracts and immunoblot analysis were done essentially as described (31Shan X. Xue Z. Melese T. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 126: 853-862Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). Monoclonal antibody 12CA5 (against HA) was purchased from Roche Molecular Biochemicals, and alkaline phosphatase-conjugated goat anti-mouse secondary antibody was from Bio-Rad. Color developing reagents, nitro blue tetrazolium and 5-bromo-4-chloro-3-indolyl phosphate, were from Sigma. The assay is described by Rosenblatt and Erbe (32Rosenblatt D.S. Erbe R.W. Pediatr. Res. 1977; 11: 1137-1141Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). The assay measures the reverse reaction that MTHFR catalyzes under physiological conditions. Briefly, 250 μg of extract was used for each reaction. The reaction mix also contained 0.18 m potassium phosphate, pH 6.3, 3.6 mm menadione bisulfite, 1.4 mmEDTA, 7.2 mm ascorbic acid, 178 μm flavin adenine dinucleotide, 420 μm 5-[14C]MeTHF. The reaction temperature was 37 °C, and the reaction time was 1 h. For heat treatment, the reaction mixes without 5-[14C]MeTHF were heated 50 °C for 20 min. 5-[14C]MeTHF was then added back to the mix and proceeded as the samples without heat treatment. The 5-[14C]MeTHF (barium salt) was from Amersham Pharmacia Biotech. All other chemicals were from Sigma. To characterize humanMTHFR in yeast, a strain lacking endogenous MTHFRwas constructed. We searched for yeast proteins with sequence similarities to human MTHFR in the Saccharomyces Genome Data Base. Protein sequence alignments showed that a polypeptide encoded by yeast MET11 shared the highest degree of identity with the human MTHFR (38.3%). To determine if MET11 encodes the yeast MTHFR enzyme, we constructed a deletion allele ofMET11 in yeast strain W303-1A (see “Materials and Methods”). We anticipated that yeast lacking MTHFR activity would require methionine for growth since 5-MeTHF is required for the synthesis of methionine from homocysteine. As expected, the resultingmet11Δ::TRP1 strain, XSY3-1A, fails to grow in media lacking methionine (see Fig. 1). To confirm further that MTHFR activity was depleted in themet11 − (XSY3-1A) yeast cells, we compared the enzyme activity of whole cell extracts made from themet11− strain and the parental strain W303-1A (see “Materials and Methods”). As shown in Fig.2, extracts made from themet11− (XSY3-1A) cells contain no detectable MTHFR activity. The genetic and enzyme activity data both indicate thatMET11 encodes yeast MTHFR and that the MET11 gene is essential for cell growth on media lacking methionine.Figure 2Enzyme activity of different alleles of human MTHFR. About 250 μg of crude yeast extract was used in each assay. For heat treatment, samples were incubated at 55 °C for 20 min before the substrate was added to the reaction mixture. Heat treatment was only performed on alleles with detectable reductase activity. The reaction time was 1 h at 37 °C, and measurements were done in triplicates.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) We next determined whether expression of humanMTHFR in the met11 − yeast cells could complement the methionine auxotrophic phenotype. We constructed a yeast centromere plasmid, phMTHFR, carrying human MTHFR cDNA controlled by the galactose-inducible yeast GAL1 promoter (see “Materials and Methods”). In the presence of galactose, this plasmid expresses wild-type human MTHFR with a hemagglutinin A (HA) epitope at its N terminus. The HA epitope allowed us to detect the protein by immunoblot analysis of whole cell extract with a monoclonal anti-HA antibody, 12CA5. This plasmid was transformed into themet11 − yeast cells. As shown in Fig.3, a doublet band was observed in the extract made from cells grown in galactose media but not in the extract from glucose-grown cells. The apparent molecular mass of the upper band is about 78 kDa, which is very close to the predicted size (74.5 kDa) for human MTHFR. The absence of the lower band in the extract of cells grown in glucose media suggests that it is related to MTHFR protein. This band could be either a proteolytic product or the result of post-translational modification. Yeast met11− cells carrying phMTHFR were then tested for growth on galactose and glucose media lacking methionine. As shown in Fig. 1, expression of human MTHFR, induced by galactose, supported the growth of met11 − cells on media lacking methionine. No growth was observed when the expression of human MTHFR was repressed in a glucose media lacking methionine. In fact, yeast met11 − expressing human MTHFR grow as well as the same strain expressing yeast MTHFR(MET11). The ability of human MTHFR to complement the auxotrophic phenotype indicates that human MTHFR and yeast MET11 encode functional homologues. To detect biological consequences caused by mutations in human MTHFR gene, we constructed four expression plasmids carrying mutant alleles of MTHFR . Each of the alleles contains a single MTHFR mutation (G164C, G458T, T980C, and C1141T), previously found in patients with clinical MTHFR deficiency (see Table I) (11Goyette P. Christensen B. Rosenblatt D.S. Rozen R. Am. J. Hum. Genet. 1996; 59: 1268-1275PubMed Google Scholar). These mutations were engineered into MTHFR cDNA by either site-directed or PCR mutagenesis (see “Materials and Methods”). The cDNA fragments were then cloned into a yeast expression vector individually (see “Materials and Methods”). The resulting plasmids are identical to phMTHFR, except each carries a mutant allele. The plamids were then transformed into the met11 −cells.Table IPlasmids carrying mutant MTHFR allelesNucleotide changeAmino acid changePlasmid carrying the mutationG164CR51PpG164CG458TG149VpG458TC677TA222VpC677TT980CL323PpT980CC1141TR377CpC1141TA1298CE429ApA1298C Open table in a new tab We ascertained that MTHFR proteins were expressed from the mutantMTHFR alleles by immunoblot analysis of yeast whole cell extracts using the anti-HA antibody. The extracts were made from yeast cells grown in galactose medium to induce the expression of the alleles (see “Materials and Methods”). Immunoblot analysis of the extracts indicates that all the alleles were expressed at a similar level to the wild type (see Fig. 3). We next examined the ability of the mutants to complement the auxotrophic phenotype of the met11 − yeast cells. As shown in Fig. 1, met11− cells expressing three of the mutant alleles, G164C, G458T, and T980C, were unable to grow in either glucose (repressed) or galactose (induced) media lacking methionine, indicating that these cells lacked MTHFR activity. Since immunoblot analysis (Fig. 3) showed that the mutant proteins were present in the cells, we conclude that these mutant proteins are non-functional. Our data show that the inability of these mutants to complement met11 − yeast cells correlates with their pathogenic effects in humans. However, one of the alleles tested, C1141T, was able to complement the methionine auxotrophic phenotype of themet11 − cells and was phenotypically indistinguishable from the wild-type MTHFR in yeast. It should be noted that this mutation was found in a patient heterozygous for C1141T, C677T, and T980C. Thus it is possible that C1141T might be deleterious only in the context of these other mutations (see “Discussion”). We next used this system to characterize two common polymorphisms found in the human MTHFR, C677T and A1298C. We constructed plasmids pC677T and pA1298C that express C677T and A1298C from theGAL1 promoter, similar to phMTHFR (see “Materials and Methods”). The two plasmids were transformed intomet11 − cells, and expression of the two alleles was confirmed by immunoblotting with anti-HA antibody (see Fig. 3). As shown in Fig. 1, these alleles were able to rescue the auxotrophic phenotype of the met11− cells. This is not unexpected for two reasons. First, human lymphocyte extracts from individuals homozygous for C677T have 40–50% MTHFR activity of the control (14Rozen R. Thromb. Haemostasis. 1997; 78: 523-526Crossref PubMed Scopus (284) Google Scholar), and those A1298C homozygotes have 62% MTHFR activity of wild-type (13van der Put N.M. Gabreels F. Stevens E.M. Smeitink J.A. Trijbels F.J. Eskes T.K. van den Heuvel L.P. Blom H.J. Am. J. Hum. Genet. 1998; 62: 1044-1051Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1357) Google Scholar). Second, in our yeast cells these alleles were expressed from the strong yeast GAL1 promoter, resulting in high levels of MTHFR protein. This would elevate the reductase activity in the cell and compensate for the low MTHFR activity of the mutant alleles. We then determined whether the ability of a human MTHFR allele to complement the yeast growth phenotype correlated with its enzymatic activity in vitro. We measured the MTHFR activities using yeast whole cell extracts containing variousMTFHR mutants (see “Materials and Methods”). As a negative control, MTHFR activity was also measured using an extract made from cells grown in glucose media where the expression of an allele was repressed. Since the gene product of the C677T allele is thermolabile (12Frosst P. Blom H.J. Milos R. Goyette P. Sheppard C.A. Matthews R.G. Boers G.J. den Heijer M. Kluijtmans L.A. van den Heuvel L.P. Rozen R. Nat. Genet. 1995; 10: 111-113Crossref PubMed Scopus (5056) Google Scholar), we have also examined thermal stability of MTHFR variants that display detectable reductase activity. As shown in Fig.2, the mutant alleles that failed to complement the yeast growth phenotype showed less than 7% of wild-type activity, whereas extracts from cells carrying the complementing alleles, C677T, A1298C, and C1141T, all exhibited high levels of enzyme activity. After heat treatment (55 °C for 20 min), we found wild-type human MTHFR retained about 40% of its original activity, whereas C677T lost almost all its activity (Fig. 2). Alleles A1298C and C1141T retained about 40% of their enzyme activity similar to that of wild-typeMTHFR. Thus A1298C and C1141T are indistinguishable from the wild type in their thermal stability and MTHFR activity in vitro. Our results show that A1298C and C1141T mutations do not cause any dysfunction of the enzyme under our assay conditions. One common feature of these two mutations is that they are located in the C-terminal domain of the protein. Comparison of human MTHFR and E. coli MetFp (encoding MTHFR in E. coli) revealed that the C terminus of human MTHFR was absent inE. coli MTHFR (Fig. 4). This suggested that the catalytic domain of human MTHFR was located in the N terminus of the protein. To verify this, we constructed a plasmid (pNhMTHFR) that expresses a truncated human MTHFR (residues 1–349). Yeast met11 − cells carrying this plasmid were able to grow on galactose medium lacking methionine but not on glucose medium lacking methionine (see Fig. 5). Further analysis (Fig. 6) showed those yeast cells expressing the truncated MTHFR grew slower than those expressing the full-length protein, suggesting that the truncated protein was less active or the protein level was low. We then determined MTHFR activity using extracts made from cells expressing truncated MTHFR. The result in Fig. 2 shows that the C-terminal truncated protein does have MTHFR activity but at a lower level compared w"

Bastadin 5 (B5) was shown to stabilize open and closed channel states with little influence on the sensitivity of the channel to activation by Ca2+ (Mack, M. M., Molinski, T. F., Buck, E.

In the present paper, we utilize single channel analysis and measurements of Ca2+ flux across the sarcoplasmic reticulum to identify bastadin 10 (B10) as the structural congener responsible for dramatically stabilizing the open conformation of the RyR channel, possibly by reducing the free energy associated with closed to open channel transitions (ΔG*c → o). The stability of the channel open state induced by B10 sensitized the channel to activation by Ca2+ to such an extent that it essentially obviated regulation by physiological concentrations of Ca2+ and relieved inhibition by physiological Mg2+. These actions of B10 were produced only on the cytoplasmic face of the channel, were selectively eliminated by pretreatment of channels with FK506 or rapamycin, and were reconstituted by human recombinant FKBP12. The actions of B10 were found to be reversible. A structure-activity model is proposed by which substitutions on the Eastern and Western hemispheres of the bastarane macrocycle may confer specificity toward the RyR1-FKBP12 complex to stabilize either the closed or open channel conformation. These results indicate that RyR1-FKBP12 complexes possesses a novel binding domain for phenoxycatechols and raise the possibility of molecular recognition of an endogenous ligand. The marine sponge Ianthella bastasynthesizes at least 25 tetrameric bromotyrosine structures that possess a stringent structural requirement for modifying the gating behavior of ryanodine-sensitive Ca2+ channels (ryanodine receptors) (RyR)). Bastadin 5 (B5) was shown to stabilize open and closed channel states with little influence on the sensitivity of the channel to activation by Ca2+ (Mack, M. M., Molinski, T. F., Buck, E. D., and Pessah, I. N. (1994)J. Biol. Chem. 269, 23236–23249).

Although immunophilins represent a structurally heterogeneous family of proteins of molecular mass ranging from 12 to 56 kDa, they share several common functional and pharmacological features. All possess rotamase (peptidylprolyl cis/trans-isomerase) activity which is inhibited by nanomolar concentrations of immunosuppressant drugs including FK506, its analogs, and rapamycin. The 12-kDa FK506-binding protein (FKBP12)1 is perhaps the best studied immunophilin and is expressed in yeast (4Heitman J. Movva N.R. Hall M.N.

Our current understanding of how FKBP12 regulates cellular signal processing largely derives from studies that examine how immunosuppressants influence gain or loss of functions through their ability to promote or disrupt physical associations between FKBP12 and key mediators of cell signaling. FK506 and rapamycin share mutually exclusive high affinity binding sites on FKBP12 but promote associations with distinct cytosolic signaling proteins (6Griffith J.P. Kim J.L. Kim E.E.

Schreiber S.L. Clardy J. Science. 1996; 273: 239-242Crossref PubMed Scopus (703) Google Scholar). For example, FK506 binds to FKBP12 and promotes an association with calcineurin thereby inhibiting phosphatase 2B activity that, in turn, is essential for regulating the phosphoryl state of a wide variety of Ca2+-dependent mediators of cell signaling including Ca2+/calmodulin-dependent kinase, nitric oxide synthase, and nuclear factor activating T-cells (1Abraham R.T. Wiederrecht G.J. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 1996; 14: 483-510Crossref PubMed Scopus (570) Google Scholar, 2Marks A.R. Physiol. Rev. 1996; 76: 631-649Crossref PubMed Scopus (336) Google Scholar, 3Snyder S.H.

By contrast, the rapamycin-FKBP12 complex promotes formation of a ternary complex with mTOR (also known as FRAP), a non-receptor protein kinase that shares C-terminal domain homology with lipid phosphatidylinositol 3-kinases, thereby inhibiting its kinase activity (8Brunn G.J.

Formation of a FKBP12-rapamycin-mTOR complex and inhibition of mTOR kinase activity prevents hyperphosphorylation of PHAS I, thereby blocking an essential step linking activation of growth factor receptors and initiation of protein translation.FKBP12 also indirectly regulates Ca2+ transport by forming tight associations with the skeletal isoform of ryanodine receptor (RyR1) Ca2+ channel complex, and Ca2+ channels activated by inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate receptors localized within sarcoplasmic (SR) and endoplasmic reticulum membranes (2Marks A.R.

The functional significance of FKBP12 is perhaps best understood in striated muscle where its association with the skeletal (RyR1) or cardiac (RyR2) isoforms of RyR appears to regulate the fidelity of intracellular Ca2+ transport, although the molecular details and physiological significance of this regulation remain unclear. Deletion of FKBP12 expression using gene targeting in mice produces severe deficits of skeletal and cardiac muscle which underscores the developmental and functional importance of FKBP12 to striated muscle (9Shou W. Aghdasi B. Armstrong D.L. Guo Q. Bao S. Charng M.J. Mathews L.M. Schneider M.D. Hamilton S.L. Matzuk M.M. Nature. 1998; 391: 489-492Crossref PubMed Scopus (349) Google Scholar). In native skeletal muscle, each RyR1 homotetramer interacts with up to four molecules of FKBP12 (10Jayaraman T. Brillantes A.M. Timerman A.P. Fleischer S. Erdjument-Bromage H. Tempst P. Marks A.R. J.

Grassucci R. Berkowitz J. Xin H.B. Fleischer S. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 32463-32471Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar). Most of our understanding of how FKBP12 regulates RyR1 function originates from studies utilizing immunosuppressants FK506 and rapamycin which, in micromolar concentration, promote dissociation of the immunophilin from the RyR1 homotetramer. Dissociation of the RyR-FKBP12 heterocomplex with immunosupressant, or expression of RyR1 in Sf9 cells that lack constitutive expression of FKBP12, alters channel conductance from a characteristically large ∼500 pS for Cs+ and 100 pS for Ca2+ to gating transitions more frequently exhibiting ¾, ½, and ¼ subconductances (12Brillantes A.B. Ondrias K. Scott A. Kobrinsky E. Ondriasová E. Moschella M.C. Jayaraman T. Landers M. Ehrlich B.E. Marks A.R.

Marks A.R. Science. 1998; 281: 818-821Crossref PubMed Scopus (350) Google Scholar). The RyR1 complex deficient of FKBP12 appears to be more sensitive to activation by caffeine and Ca2+(10Jayaraman T.

Essentially their actions of promoting or breaking physical associations with key mediators of cell signaling have been correlated with altered function. Therefore compounds that mediate their effects in an FKBP12-dependent manner without dissociating the physical interaction with the target signaling protein, e.g. RyR1, may provide unique insight into the following: 1) the possible endogenous functions of FKBP12 in regulating SR/endoplasmic reticulum Ca2+ transport, and 2) the chemical structure of natural ligands and their binding sites within the RyR1-FKBP12 complex. We previously reported that bromotyrosine derivatives known as bastadins isolated from the marine sponge Ianthella basta (Pallas) dramatically alter SR Ca2+ transport and channel gating behavior of RyR1 in a manner that appears to require the integrity of the FKBP12-RyR complex, and these actions exhibited a stringent structure-activity relationship (17Mack M.M.

In the presence of physiological concentrations of K+ and Na+, bastadin 5 (B5) was shown to allosterically enhance maximal occupancy of [3H]ryanodine to high affinity sites and diminished the tendency for low affinity binding sites in junctional SR. In bilayer lipid membrane (BLM) studies, B5 dramatically slowed single channel gating kinetics without significantly altering unitary conductance or open probability. The unique actions of B5 were eliminated by either FK506 or rapamycin, suggesting the pharmacological actions of bastadins were mediated by a novel modulatory site that requires the structural integrity of the FKBP12-RyR channel complex. More recently, B5 and ryanodine in combination were shown to enhance steady-state Ca2+ loading capacity of junctional SR vesicles by 2–3-fold, revealing a possible role of RyR1-FKBP12 complexes in regulating the filling capacity of the SR Ca2+store by influencing a “leak” conformation of RyR1 (19Pessah I.N.

The unique actions of bastadin 10 (B10) were originally predicted to exist from results obtained with extracts containing a mixture of bastadins (17Mack M.M. Molinski T.F. Buck E.D. Pessah I.N. J.

By contrast, the rapamycin-FKBP12 complex promotes formation of a ternary complex with mTOR (also known as FRAP), a non-receptor protein kinase that shares C-terminal domain homology with lipid phosphatidylinositol 3-kinases, thereby inhibiting its kinase activity (8Brunn G.J.

The A126 cell line, a derivative of PC12, is defective in cAMP-induced transcription and does not differentiate in the presence of cAMP. In these cells overexpression of a cAMP-dependent protein kinase (PKA) anchor protein, AKAP75, and of the PKA catalytic subunit substantially increased the fraction of PKAII bound to the membrane, stimulated the transcription of cAMP-induced genes, and induced terminal differentiation. Conversely, wild type PC12 cells expressing a derivative of the AKAP75 protein, AKAP45, which binds the PKA regulatory subunits RII, but fails to locate them to the membranes, induced translocation of PKAII to the cytosol. These cells did not efficiently accumulate PKA catalytic subunit in the nuclei when stimulated with cAMP, did not transcribe cAMP-induced genes, and failed to differentiate when exposed to cAMP.

In eukaryotes, cAMP binds the regulatory (R) subunit of cAMP-dependent protein kinases (PKA).1 This binding releases the catalytic subunit (C-PKA) which phosphorylates a wide range of substrate proteins. A fraction of the C-PKA migrates to the nucleus and phosphorylates nuclear proteins and transacting factors (4Hagiwara M. Brindle P. Harootunian A. Armstrong R. Rivier J. Vale W. Tsien R.

The distinctive characteristics of PKA are largely determined by the structure and properties of their R subunits (3Taylor S.S. Buechler J.A. Yonemoto W. Annu. Rev.

We have provided evidence linking membrane targeting of PKAII to cAMP-dependent gene transcription in differentiated and non-differentiated cells. In thyroid cells, displacement of immobilized PKAII from perinuclear sites to the cytoplasm impaired cAMP-induced transcription of the thyroglobulin gene (12Feliciello A. Giuliano P. Porcellini A.

Also, in non-neuronal cells positioning of PKAII in the membranes significantly stimulated the rate and the magnitude of transcription of cAMP-induced promoters (13Feliciello A. Li Y.

We have used PC12 as a model system to study the transmission of cAMP signals under well defined conditions. PC12 cells terminally differentiate in neurons when exposed to cAMP (1Corbitt J.

Biochem. 1997; 66: 807-822Crossref PubMed Scopus (860) Google Scholar). A PC12 derivative cell line has been isolated, which proliferates and does not differentiate when exposed to cAMP. This cell line, A126, efficiently differentiates when treated with NGF or other agents which stimulate protein kinase C or Ras, indicating that the cAMP and Ras pathways are independently required for the execution of the differentiation program in PC12 cells (14Van Buskirk R. Corcoran T. Wagner J.A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1985; 5: 1984-1992Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar,15Damon D.H. D'Amore P.A. Wagner J. Cell Biol. 1990; 110: 1333-1339Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar). The A126 cells fail to transcribe cAMP-induced genes, although they normally grow in presence of the cyclic nucleotide. These cells contain mostly cytosolic PKAII, and we have provided evidence suggesting that the failure to activate cAMP-induced genes is because of the loss of membrane-bound PKAII (16Cassano S.

Here, we show that A126 cells, overexpressing the anchor protein AKAP75 and the catalytic subunit of PKA, significantly increase the fraction of membrane-bound PKA. These cells transcribe cAMP-induced genes and differentiate when exposed to cAMP, becoming undistinguishable from wild type PC12 cells. These data indicate that membrane-bound PKA positively controls cAMP-dependent transcription and terminal differentiation in PC12 cells. PC12 and A126 1B2 cells were grown in RPMI medium containing 5% fetal calf serum, 10% horse serum, 100 units/ml penicillin, 100 μg/ml streptomycin, and 2 mmglutamine.

Stable transfectants were generated as follows. 107 cells/100-mm dish were transfected with a total amount of 20 μg of DNA: 5 μg of RSV-NEO, 5 μg of AK75, 5 μg of C-PKA, and salmon sperm to 20 μg. 72 h later, the cells were split and fresh medium was added. Selection was carried in G418 for 3 weeks. Single colonies (∼50) were pooled and expanded for further studies. Transient transfections were carried with a total amount of 10 μg of DNA: 5 μg of CRE-CAT and 5 μg RSV-lacZ. 44 h later, the cells were stimulated with 0.5 mm 8-Br-cAMP for 4 h. CAT activity was assayed in extracts containing equivalent units of β-galactosidase (0.1, 0.2 unit), (1 unit is the absorbance at 420 nm of the extracts incubated with 1 mg/ml 2-nitrophenyl-d-galactopyranoside transferase at 37 °C for 1 h). Experiments showing differences oflacZ expression more than 2-fold have been eliminated. The cells were washed with phosphate-buffered saline and lysed mechanically as described previously (1Corbitt J. Vivekananda J. Wang S.S. Strong R. J. Neurochem. 1998; 71: 478-486Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). The pellet was treated with AT buffer (15 mm NaCl, 60 mm KCl, 15 mm Hepes (pH 7.8), 2 mm EDTA, 0.3 m sucrose, 14 mm β-mercaptoethanol) containing 1% Triton X-100 for 15 min at 4 °C and sonicated 3 pulses of 20 s. Preparation of cytosolic fractions was carried out as described previously (16Cassano S. Gallo A. Buccigrossi V. Porcellini A. Cerillo R. Gottesman M.E. Avvedimento V.E. J. Biol.

The proteins were transferred to nitrocellulose filters (0.45 mm Schleicher & Schuell) and probed with purified RIIβ (a gift of Dr. C.

After washing (three times in TBST for 15 min), the nitrocellulose membranes were incubated with peroxidase-conjugated anti-rabbit IgG (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) in 5% in non-fat dry milk in TBST for 1 h and developed by ECL (16Cassano S.

The cells were lysed in AT buffer containing 0.1% Triton X-100 by incubation for 5 min on ice. The lysate was layered on 1 volume of a sucrose cushion (AT buffer containing 1 m sucrose) and centrifuged at 2,500 ×g for 5 min. The pellet represents purified nuclei, and the upper phase contains the cytoplasm. The nuclear fraction contained ∼90% of the transcription factors: TTF1, CREB, and PAX8 (21Gallo A. Benusiglio E.

Each preparation was stained with propidium iodide to check purity. PKA assays (final volume 25 μl) were performed at 30 °C for 10 min in a solution containing 100 μm ATP, [γ-32P]ATP (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) (125–150 cpm/pmol) at a final concentration of 10 μCi/100 μl of reaction mixture, 10 mm MgCl2, 20 mm Hepes (pH 7.4), 100 μm Kemptide (Sigma). When measuring PKA holoenzyme, 10–50 μm cAMP was added. PKA activity was fully inhibited by adding a specific PKA inhibitor peptide (10 μm) containing a PKA pseudophosphorylation site (Sigma). Kemptide phosphorylation was monitored by spotting 20 μl of the incubation mixture on phosphocellulose filters (Whatman, P81) and washing with 75 mm phosphoric acid, as described previously (12Feliciello A.

The radioactivity retained on the filters was determined by scintillation counting in 4 ml of scintillation liquid (Ecolite, ICN). Free C-PKA activity was evaluated by subtracting cpm obtained in the absence of cAMP from the values obtained in the presence of PKA inhibitor peptide. Data were expressed as picomoles of [32P]phosphate transferred to the peptide substrate during a 10-min incubation in the presence (PKA holoenzyme) or absence (free C-PKA) of 10 μm cAMP. At the concentrations used, PKA inhibitor peptide did not inhibit the binding of phosphorylated Kemptide to phosphocellulose filters (12Feliciello A. Giuliano P. Porcellini A. Garbi C. Obici S.

Cells (2–4 × 104) grown in RPMI medium were induced with 1 mm 8-Br-cAMP for 12 days and 100 ng/ml NGF (Upstate Biotechnology Inc.) for 5 days. The cells received fresh medium supplemented with 8-Br-cAMP or NGF at 2-day intervals. A neurite was identified as a process whose length was 1.5 times the cell body. 200 cells were counted for each plate, and the percentage of cells with neurites was calculated as described (15Damon D.H. D'Amore P.A. Wagner J. Cell Biol. 1990; 110: 1333-1339Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar). Total RNA (30 μg) was size-fractionated in 2.2 m formaldehyde:1% agarose gel and transferred to N-Hybond filters (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). Hybridization was performed at 42 °C for 15 h in 50% formamide, 0.1% SDS, 5× SSC, 5× Denhardt's solution. The filters were washed at 42 °C in 0.2× SSC (22Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. 2nd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989: 7.3-7.8Google Scholar). A126 cells do not differentiate when exposed to cAMP because cAMP-stimulated transcription is defective. We previously found that these cells contain mostly cytosolic PKAII, and we have provided evidence suggesting that the failure to activate cAMP-sensitive genes was dependent on the absence of membrane-bound PKAII (16Cassano S. Gallo A. Buccigrossi V. Porcellini A. Cerillo R. Gottesman M.E. Avvedimento V.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 29870-29875Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). To prove that when PKAII is localized to the membranes it can reactivate cAMP-induced transcription, we transfected A126 cells with plasmid constructs expressing the RII-binding protein AKAP75, or the catalytic subunit of PKA, or both genes. Stable transfectants were selected, pooled (∼50 for each DNA construct), analyzed for the expression of the plasmid vectors, and further characterized. Cells transfected with C-PKA contained two-fold higher PKA activity compared with NEO or AKAP75 transfectants (data not shown). We first determined the cytosolic/membrane partition of endogenous RII subunits in transfected cells. Fig. 1 shows RIIα and RIIβ present in the cytosolic (C) and membrane (P) fractions derived from transfected cells. The blots were analyzed by ligand blotting assay using labeled RII as the probe (A) or by immunoblot with specific anti RIIβ (B) or anti RIIα (C) antibodies. Panel A in Fig. 1 shows that AKAP75 transfected cells contain in the membrane fraction a band which strongly interacts with labeled RII (lanes indicated byA75 and A75+C). This band of approximately 75 kDa corresponds to the exogenous AKAP75 protein (Fig.1 A, lanes 4 and 6). Other RII-binding proteins of approximately 220, 150, and 85 kDa are present in the membrane fraction. The 85–90-kDa RII-binding protein is induced in A126 cells expressing AKAP75 or C-PKA alone (Fig. 1 A,lanes 6 and 8). The 150–220-kDa proteins are induced in cells expressing AKAP75 (Fig. 1, lane 4). The levels of these RII binding proteins are high in PC12 and reduced in A126 cells. A minor band of ∼52 kDa is detected in the lower part of the blot. This band corresponds to RII subunits, which are better defined in the B (RIIβ) and C (RIIα)panels of Fig. 1. RIIβ is found exclusively in the cytosol of A126 cells (Fig. 1, A and B, lanes 1, and Ref. 16Cassano S. Gallo A. Buccigrossi V. Porcellini A. Cerillo R. Gottesman M.E. Avvedimento V.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 29870-29875Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). Expression of AKAP75 in combination with C-PKA subunit significantly increases RIIβ in the membrane fraction (Fig.1 B, lane 6). In these transfectants, a significant fraction of RIIβ translocates to the membranes (see the histogram below the blot). As to RIIα, we did not detect significant variations relative to control cells (Fig. 1, panel C), indicating that AKAP75 expression influences predominantly the membrane-cytoplasmic partition of RIIβ. This finding might be explained by the higher binding affinity of AKAP75 to RIIβ relative to RIIα (23Leiser M. Rubin C.S. Erlichman J. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 1904-1908Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). AKAP75 is limiting in these cells, as demonstrated by the residual RIIβ in the cytosol (Fig. 1 B). These clones do not express very high levels of AKAP75, and under these conditions AKAP75 affects preferentially cytosolic/membrane partition of RIIβ but not RIIα. In transfectants expressing high levels of AKAP75, both RIIα and RIIβ are targeted to the membranes (data not shown, and Ref. 13Feliciello A. Li Y. Avvedimento V.E. Gottesman M.E. Rubin C.S. Curr. Biol. 1997; 7: 1011-1014Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). To determine the biological effects of membrane-bound PKA, we tested cAMP-induced transcription in the cells mentioned above by assaying the transient expression of CAT driven by a cAMP-induced promoter (CRE). Fig. 2 shows that cAMP-induced transcription was markedly stimulated in the cells transfected with C-PKA and AKAP75. The effects of AKAP75 and C-PKA were synergistic, indicating that the increase in total PKA by C-PKA and membrane anchoring by AKAP75 expression independently contributed to the stimulation of cAMP-induced transcription, defective in A126 cells (Fig. 2). A126 cells were originally isolated as cells resistant to cAMP-induced differentiation, we therefore tested whether the expression of AKAP75 and C-PKA could rescue this phenotype. Fig.3 A shows that A126 cells expressing exogenous AKAP75 and C-PKA (A75+C-PKA) differentiated efficiently when stimulated with cAMP (75% of the cells showed neurite outgrowth versus 10% in control cells). This effect was cAMP-dependent since these cells did not differentiate in the absence of cAMP (Fig. 3 A, A75+C-PKA). We also measured the growth profile of these cells in the presence of cAMP (Fig. 3 B). The growth of cells expressing AKAP75 and C-PKA was markedly inhibited by cAMP, whereas control or mock-transfected cells proliferated in the presence of cAMP for 12 days. Cells expressing AKAP75 or C-PKA alone proliferated more slowly than control A126 cells in the presence of cAMP. These data indicate that relocation of PKA to the membrane reverses the block in cAMP-induced transcription and restores cAMP-induced differentiation in A126 cells. The experiments shown above indicate that membrane-bound PKA stimulates the transcription of cAMP-induced genes and the differentiation of A126 cells. To conclusively determine the role of membrane-bound PKA in the amplification of cAMP signals, we performed the complementary experiment. We expressed in the wild type PC12 cells a derivative of AKAP75 protein, which contains a deletion at the NH terminus. Since this segment of the protein contains the protein domain which is necessary for membrane binding, overexpression of this mutant, AKAP45, translocates RII and PKAII to the cytosol (24Glanz S.B. Li Y. Rubin C.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 12796-12804Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). PC12 stable transfectants expressing AKAP45 were isolated and analyzed by immunoblot with anti-RIIα- and -RIIβ-specific antibodies. Fig.4 A shows an overlay experiment using labeled RIIβ as probe. In control cells (NEO), we detected two major RII-binding proteins of size ∼110–150 and 85 kDa. These proteins were not detected in AKAP45-transfected cells. Fig.4 B shows a Western blot of the same extracts with specific antibodies to bovine the AKAP75 (18Hirsh Allen H. Glantz S.B. Li Y. You Y. Rubin C.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 2131-2134Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The two arrowsindicate the endogenous AKAP150 (homologous to the bovine AKAP75) and the exogenous AKAP45 (18Hirsh Allen H. Glantz S.B. Li Y. You Y. Rubin C.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 2131-2134Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Note that the endogenous AKAP150 was down-regulated in cells expressing AKAP45. This effect is seen more dramatically in the overlay blot shown in Fig. 4 A. The same cell extracts were also analyzed by immunoblotting with specific anti-RIIβ and anti RIIα antibodies. The 52-kDa band corresponds to the RII subunits, RIIβ (Fig. 4 C) and RIIα (Fig.4 D). Expression of AKAP45 significantly increased RII subunits in the cytosol. PKA activation by cAMP was measured in these cells. Fig.5 shows that cAMP-induced accumulation of nuclear C-PKA was substantially reduced in AKAP45-expressing cells compared with control cells (Fig. 5, upper panel). Also, cytoplasmic PKA was not efficiently activated by cAMP (Fig. 5,lower panel) or forskolin (data not shown), when compared with control cells. It is of interest to note that inefficient PKA activation was found in A126 cells, which are refractory to cAMP-induced differentiation (14Van Buskirk R. Corcoran T. Wagner J.A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1985; 5: 1984-1992Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar, 16Cassano S. Gallo A. Buccigrossi V. Porcellini A. Cerillo R. Gottesman M.E. Avvedimento V.E. J. Biol.

The ratio PKAII/PKAI in PC12 expressing AKAP45 was unchanged compared with wild type PC12 (data not shown). Total PKA in PC12-A45 was ∼80% of that found in wild type PC12 (see legend of Fig. 5). Nuclear cAMP signaling in PC12 cells expressing A45 was significantly down-regulated as shown by inefficient accumulation of nuclear C-PKA following cAMP stimulation (Fig. 5, upper panel). Activation of transcription of a CRE promoter following cAMP stimulation was reduced in terms of magnitude and kinetics (Fig.6). PC12 cells exposed to cAMP stop growing and differentiate (14Van Buskirk R. Corcoran T. Wagner J.A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1985; 5: 1984-1992Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar, 15Damon D.H.

The left panel in Fig.7 shows that the growth of these cells is not inhibited by cAMP as control cells. Furthermore, the induction of differentiation genes (c-Fos, H-Ferritin, and vgf) by cAMP was significantly depressed in A45-expressing cells (Fig. 7, right panel). The induction of the same genes by NGF was unchanged in AKAP45-expressing cells. Neurite outgrowth, a very sensitive marker of cAMP biological response in PC12 cells, was significantly depressed in PC12-A45 cells (Fig. 8 B).Figure 8PC12 expressing AKAP45 do not differentiate when exposed to cAMP. Control and AKAP45 expressing (A45) cells were plated at the concentration of 5 × 104 and induced with 1 mm 8-Br-cAMP for 12 days (panels A and B, respectively). Panel C shows PC12 expressing AKAP45 stimulated with NGF (100 ng/ml) for 3 days.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Table I summarizes the data and illustrates that the expression of A45 in PC12 cells, which results in translocation of PKAII to the cytosol, down-regulates the cAMP biological response.Table IOverexpression of AKAP-45 inhibits cAMP-induced differentiation in PC12Inducer1-acAMP and NGF treatments are indicated in the legend of Figure 8.Cell type1-bThe cell lines are indicated in the text.

This effect is mediated by the stimulation of transcription of cAMP-responsive genes (16Cassano S. Gallo A. Buccigrossi V. Porcellini A. Cerillo R. Gottesman M.E. Avvedimento V.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 29870-29875Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar, 25Kim K.-S. Ishiguro H. Tinti C. Wagner J. Joh T.H. J. Neurosci. 1994; 14: 7200-7207Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The mutant cell line A126 is defective in cAMP-induced transcription and does not differentiate when exposed to cAMP (14Van Buskirk R. Corcoran T. Wagner J.A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1985; 5: 1984-1992Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar, 26Henderson L.P. Gdovin M.J. Liu C. Gardner P.D. Maue R.A. J. Neurosci. 1994; 14: 1153-1163Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). PKA is present and active, albeit reduced, but is localized exclusively in the cytosol (16Cassano S. Gallo A. Buccigrossi V. Porcellini A. Cerillo R. Gottesman M.E. Avvedimento V.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 29870-29875Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). Expression of a PKA anchor protein, AKAP75, relocates PKAII to the membranes and activates cAMP-induced transcription. Co-expression of C-PKA and AKAP75 completely reverses the block of cAMP-induced transcription and differentiation. Note that C-PKA or AKAP75 alone did not restore cAMP-induced transcription in A126 cells (Fig. 2 and Ref. 16Cassano S. Gallo A. Buccigrossi V. Porcellini A. Cerillo R. Gottesman M.E. Avvedimento V.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 29870-29875Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). On the other hand, C-PKA is also required for membrane localization of RIIβ because the expression of RIIβ binding proteins is stimulated by PKA (Fig. 1, panel A and Ref. 27Feliciello A. Rubin C.S. Avvedimento E.V. Gottesman M.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 23361-23366Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). A126 cells were selected for their ability to grow in the presence of high cAMP concentrations (14Van Buskirk R. Corcoran T. Wagner J.A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1985; 5: 1984-1992Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar).These cells became resistant to cAMP inhibition of growth probably by reducing the pool of membrane-bound PKAII (Fig. 1). However, we cannot exclude that the A126 phenotype might result from other yet unknown mutations in pathways directly or indirectly affecting cAMP signaling. One way to demonstrate the cause-effect relationship between membrane-bound PKA and cAMP-induced differentiation was to generate the A126 defective phenotype in wild type PC12 by manipulating only the localization of endogenous PKA. The experiments shown here indicate that the expression of a mutated variant of AKAP75, AKAP45, which binds RII but fails to localize it to the membranes, alters the membrane-cytosol partition of RII and significantly increases the fraction of cytosolic RII. cAMP-induced nuclear accumulation of C-PKA and cAMP-induced transcription are significantly down-regulated in these transfectants, indicating that membrane-bound PKA positively regulates cAMP-induced transcription (Fig. 6). The effects elicited by AKAP45 are solely dependent on RII binding because this mutant does not bind membrane, PKC, or calcineurin (19Ndubuka C. Li Y. Rubin C.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 7621-7624Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 21Gallo A. Benusiglio E. Bonapace I.M. Feliciello A. Cassano S. Garbi C. Musti A.M. Gottesman M.E. Avvedimento V.E. Genes Dev. 1992; 6: 1621-1633Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). Recently, we have shown that a version of AKAP45, which does not bind RII, does not down-regulate cAMP-induced transcription. 2Feliciello, A., Gallo, A., Porcellini, A., Hesman, M. E., and Avvedimento, E. V. (1999) J. Biol. Chem., (in press). PC12 cells expressing AKAP45 mimic A126 mutant cells and become refractory to cAMP signaling. Thus, these cells proliferate and fail to differentiate when exposed to cAMP. Biochemical comparative analysis of PC12 cells expressing AKAP45 indicate that they are very similar to A126 because 1) endogenous cAMP levels are not altered (Ref. 16Cassano S. Gallo A. Buccigrossi V. Porcellini A. Cerillo R. Gottesman M.E. Avvedimento V.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 29870-29875Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar, and data not shown), 2) cytoplasmic PKA is not efficiently activated by cAMP in PC12-A45 and A126 cells (Ref. 16Cassano S. Gallo A. Buccigrossi V. Porcellini A. Cerillo R. Gottesman M.E. Avvedimento V.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 29870-29875Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar, and Fig. 5), and 3) the expression of RII-binding proteins is down-regulated (Figs. 1 and 4). We have previously shown that A126 cells contain an excess of R subunits in the cytosol that efficiently buffers exogenous C-PKA, added to the extracts. Thus, PKA in these cells is efficiently activatedin vitro but not in vivo (16Cassano S. Gallo A. Buccigrossi V. Porcellini A. Cerillo R. Gottesman M.E. Avvedimento V.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 29870-29875Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). We have reproduced this phenotype in PC12 that express AKAP45, which do not respond to cAMP (Figs. 5 and 8). We suggest that excess of R subunits in the cytosol inhibits PKA dissociation and reduces cAMP-dependent activation of the enzyme. PC12 cells expressing AKAP45 show the same PKA phenotype as A126 cells. As to the endogenous PKA anchor proteins in PC12, a comparative analysis of the overlay blots of the AKAP45 and AKAP75 transfectants indicates that 1) two major protein species binding RII are present in the membranes of PC12 cells, one ∼150 kDa and the other ∼85 kDa of molecular mass (Fig. 4, panel A); 2) the expression of both proteins is reduced in A126 and PC12-A45 cells; and 3) the level of expression of each of the endogenous RII-binding proteins is modulated differently in response to cAMP signaling (Fig. 1, panel A, see also Ref. 27Feliciello A. Rubin C.S. Avvedimento E.V. Gottesman M.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 23361-23366Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar for cAMP-induced AKAP). The reduction of the AKAP proteins in A126 might be a consequence of the down-regulation of the expression of cAMP-induced genes (27Feliciello A. Rubin C.S. Avvedimento E.V. Gottesman M.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 23361-23366Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). This further down-regulated cAMP-induced transcription and differentiation. The definition of the biological roles of the PC12 AKAPs requires the molecular cloning of the species indicated above. In conclusion, we have demonstrated that membrane-bound PKA amplifies cAMP signals to the nucleus, and it is essential in cAMP-induced differentiation of PC12 cells. We especially thank Graciana Diez-Roux for the critical comments to the manuscript and Dr. C. Rubin for providing antibodies to AKAP75 protein."
