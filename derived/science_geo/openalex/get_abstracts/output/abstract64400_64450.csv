https://openalex.org/W2035581455,"The anxiety-reducing effects of minor tranquilizers in the rat conflict test were mimicked by serotonin antagonists and by p-chlorophenylalanine, an inhibitor of serotonin synthesis; the depressant effects of the minor tranquilizers were mimicked by norepinephrine antagonists. Intraventricular injections of serotonin led to a suppression of behavior, and also antagonized the anxiety-reducing action of benzodiazeprines. Intraventricular injections of norepinephrine led to a release of punished behavior from suppression, and also antagonized the depressant action of benzodiazepines. The anxiety-reducing activity, and the decrease in serotonin turnover induced by benzodiazepines, were maintained over repeated doses, whereas depressant activity, and the decrease induced in norepinephrine turnover, both rapidly underwent tolerance. Tranquilizers may exert their anxiety-reducing effects by a reduction of serotonin activity in a behaviorally suppressive punishment system, and they may exert their depressant effects by a reduction of norepinephrine activity in a behaviorally facilitatory reward system."
https://openalex.org/W1543033526,"Abstract Two limiting structures may be assigned to the primary derivative of peroxidases (Compound I) demanding either (a) total or (b) partial retention of peroxide components. It is now shown that (a) interaction of horseradish peroxidase with m-nitroperbenzoic acid, in 15 mm phosphate, pH 6.2, 25°, leads to the stoichiometric formation of the enzyme-peroxide derivative, m-nitrobenzoate and 1 proton; and (b) in 5 mm phosphate, pH 6.6, 10°, the conversion of horseradish peroxidase into Compound I with ethyl hydrogen peroxide, is attended by the release of ethanol, but without concomitant prototropic changes. The results establish that horseradish peroxidase (H-peroxidase) Compound I is not an enzyme peroxide complex, but a derivative in which the active site is oxidized. The optical spectra of H-peroxidase and Compound I in 5 mm phosphate, pH 6.6, 25°, were re-examined and extended to include previously undefined features in the near infrared absorption region. The spectrum of Compound I is devoid of bands typical of isoporphyrins, suggesting that conversion of the enzyme into Compound I does not involve covalent modification of the prosthetic group."
https://openalex.org/W1516377333,"SUMMARY n-Ribulose-l , 5-di-P carboxylase, purified from soybeans, had K, values of 0.13 XnM for COS and 0.19 mM for ribulose1,5-di-P under a Nz atmosphere. O2 inhibited 14C02 incorporation by the enzyme and this inhibition was rapidly reversed by Ns. Inhibition was competitive with respect to CO2 and uncompetitive with respect to ribulose-1,5-di-P. The Ki for O2 was 0.8 mM. This O2 inhibition, together with the ribulose-1,5-di-P carboxylase-catalyzed oxidation of ribulose-l ,5-di-P to P-glycolate observed previously (Bowes, G., Ogren, W. L., and Hageman, R. H. (1971) Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 45, 716-722), explains the “Warburg effect”: the rapidly reversible O2 inhibition of photosynthesis and stimulation of glycolate production seen in plants and isolated chloroplasts. In corn and soybean extracts, ribulose-1,5di-P carboxylase was inhibited by O2 but P-enolpyruvate carboxylase was unaffected. These data may explain the different response to O2 by plants which utilize ribulose-1,5-di-P carboxylase for the initial photosynthetic carboxylation and those utilizing P-enolpyruvate carboxylase. The optimum temperature for purified ribulose-1,5-di-P carboxylase was 55” and activation energies, in kilocalories per mole, were 18.4 in Nt and 20.4 in OZ. Phosphorylated compounds inhibited 14C02 incorporation by the enzyme. Nonphosphorylated sugars, including ribulose, did not inhibit. Fructose-1,6-di-P was a competitive inhibitor with respect to ribulose-l,S-di-P, the Ki being 0.88 mM. Fructose-l, 6-di-P was a more effective inhibitor than fructose-6-P, fructose-l-P, and ribulose-5-P suggesting that both phosphate groups of ribulose-1,5-di-P are involved in binding to the enzyme. HgCl, was a noncompetitive inhibitor with respect to COZ and a mixed inhibitor with respect to ribulose-1,5-di-P, suggesting that sulfhydryl groups are not involved in COZ binding but may be close to the site where ribulose-1,5-di-P binds to the enzyme."
https://openalex.org/W2152875061,"Abstract The complete amino acid sequence of 147 residues has been determined for the major monomeric component of the hemoglobin of the bloodworm, Glycera dibranchiata. The residues at 34 sites (23%) appear to be identical with those in sperm whale myoglobin. Of the 7 invariant residues found in vertebrate hemoglobins only three are present in this molecule: the glycine and phenylalanine residues at positions 27 (B6) and 45 (CD1), respectively, and the proximal heme-linked histidyl residue; the distal heme-linked histidine in vertebrate hemoglobins has been replaced by leucine."

The agglutinin was purified 184-fold to homogeneity from commercial wheat germ lipase. A molecular weight of 23,500 was estimated for the protein by means of sedimentation equilibrium and sodium dodecyl sulfate gel electrophoresis. The agglutinin is a glycoprotein. Amino acid and carbohydrate compositions are reported. The protein contains unusually high half-cystine and glycine. Glucose was found to be the major carbohydrate constituent."
https://openalex.org/W1526421290,"Abstract An increase in chromatin template activity occurs within 1 hour after confluent monolayers of WI-38 human diploid fibroblasts are stimulated to proliferate by a change of medium. The present experiments were designed to investigate the role of non-histone chromosomal proteins in the stimulation of chromatin template activity. Chromatin from unstimulated WI-38 cells or from WI-38 cells 1 hour following stimulation was dissociated and then reconstituted with HeLa cell DNA, pooled histones, and non-histone chromosomal proteins from either unstimulated WI-38 cells or WI-38 cells 1 hour after stimulation. The template activity of chromatin reconstituted with non-histone chromosomal proteins from stimulated WI-38 cells was higher than the template activity of chromatin reconstituted with nonhistone chromosomal proteins from unstimulated cells. These results imply that the increased template activity of chromatin from stimulated WI-38 cells is due to changes in the constituent non-histone chromosomal proteins."
https://openalex.org/W1591714527,"Succinylation of ovine luteinizing hormone α subunit (LH-α) and tryptic cleavage at the available arginine residues provided two fractions, only one of which contained disulfide bonds. Reduction and aminoethylation of the disulfide bonds provided two additional fractions. From these three major fractions, whose positional sequence in the original subunit could be established, the amino acid sequence for the 96 amino acid residues in the entire subunit was established. Appropriate use was made of the cyanogen bromide cleavage products and tryptic cleavage at the S-aminoethylcysteine residues, in conjunction with the Edman degradation, to establish this sequence. Determination of the NH2-terminal sequence proved difficult in view of a heterogeneity resulting from an apparent proteolytic degradation involving the first 6 residues. This sequence was ultimately clarified by a study of the cyanogen bromide cleavage peptides released after attack at the methionine in position 8. The sequence of ovine LH-α determined in the present report is identical with that for bovine thyroid-stimulating hormone α-subunit determined by Liao and Pierce (1971) J. Biol. Chem. 246, 850) and differs by a 2 residue inversion from the ovine LH-α sequence presented in a brief communication by Papkoff et. al. ((1971) J. Amer. Chem. Soc. 93, 1531)."
https://openalex.org/W1563227285,"Abstract It is known that l-homoarginine fails to inhibit human intestinal and placental alkaline phosphohydrolases under conditions which produce inhibition of bone and liver isoenzymes. Now, the mechanism of inhibition by l-homoarginine of human liver and bone alkaline phosphatases has been investigated. Results of inhibition by l-homoarginine were very similar for these two isoenzymes and resembled other organ-specific inhibitors of alkaline phosphatase isoenzymes; l-phenylalanine and l-tryptophan which, however, inhibit intestinal and placental alkaline phosphohydrolases but not liver and bone isoenzymes. Thus, the inhibition by l-homoarginine was independent of pH, but dependent on substrate concentration up to 5 mm. Further increase of substrate concentration, however, had little effect on the inhibition. The double reciprocal plots of 1/v versus 1/s at various concentrations of l-homoarginine showed a series of parallel lines indicating that the mechanism of inhibition was uncompetitive. Partial denaturation of the enzyme with heat, urea, or papain digestion had no effect on the inhibition but a shift of the optimum temperature for maximum velocity to a higher temperature, from 37–45° for bone isoenzyme and 39–45° for liver isoenzyme, was observed when the inhibitor was present in the enzyme digest. Hyperbolic curves were obtained when the percentage of inhibition was plotted against substrate concentration at different temperatures. The n value which is the apparent number of inhibitor molecules combining with one active site of the enzyme molecule was calculated to be 1.02 to 1.04 for bone and 0.90 to 0.94 for liver alkaline phosphatases."
https://openalex.org/W2114381016,"Proton-decoupled Fourier transform nuclear magnetic resonance of natural abundance 13C was used to obtain spectra of ribonuclease A and its oxidized derivative at a set of pH values ranging from pH 1.40 to 6.72 at 45°. Observations on the native conformation were made at pH 4.14 and 6.55, and on the denatured conformation at pH 2.12 and below. In addition, the disrupted structure obtained by performic acid oxidation of the disulfide bonds was observed at several pH values. The loss of the native structure was associated with sharpening of the resonance bands. A tentative assignment was made for the unmodified ribonuclease A at pH 1.46 based on resonance positions of free amino acids and peptides. Although a good fit to the data was obtained, further development is required for unequivocal assignment. Partially relaxed spectra were used to obtain spin-lattice relaxation times (T1) for certain carbon types. These values are traced through several pH values for both ribonuclease A and its oxidized derivatives. Pairs of effective rotational correlation times (τeff) were derived from the T1 values of certain aliphatic resonances. By considering data from fluorescence depolarization experiments and observed line widths, it was possible to exclude one of the τeff values in the majority of cases. The results were interpreted in terms of increased segmental mobility in the denatured states, especially for α carbon nuclei that appear relatively restrained in the native state."
https://openalex.org/W2058504444,"A quantitative method was used to determine the concentration of receptor-estrogen complex in the nuclear fraction of rat uterine cells throughout the estrous cycle. The concentrations of nuclear receptor-estrogen complex were: metestrus, 0.22; diestrus, 0.75; proestrus, 1.29; and estrus, 0.31 picomoles per milligram of DNA. This cyclic fluctuation in the nuclear complex closely parallels the secretion of ovarian estrogen during the estrous cycle, an indication that the accumulation of receptor-estrogen complex by the nuclear fraction of uterine cells may be of physiological significance, and under the control of endogenous estrogen."
https://openalex.org/W1600280599,"Abstract The soluble glycoprotein components of the S-carboxy-methylated glomerular basement membrane were fractionated by gel filtration in sodium dodecyl sulfate on agarose columns of varying porosity and by DEAE-cellulose chromatography in urea. By such techniques, these components, which represented 70 to 80% of the total membrane and ranged in molecular weight from 30,000 to greater than 700,000, were resolved into fractions differing markedly in their amino acid and sugar composition. Some contained large amounts of hydroxyproline, glycine, and hydroxylysine, while others had fewer of these amino acids characteristic of collagen and were richer in amino acids such as aspartic acid, serine, threonine, tyrosine, lysine, histidine, and S-carboxymethyl-cysteine. The fractions with the more collagen-like composition had a higher number of hydroxylysine-linked glucosylgalactose disaccharide units than did the fractions which were more polar in nature, with as many as 35 units per 1000 amino acids occurring in the former and as few as 2 per 1000 amino acids in the latter. The heteropolysaccharide units (consisting of sialic acid, fucose, galactose, mannose, and hexosamines) were more evenly distributed, ranging from 1 to 4 units per 1000 amino acids with a somewhat higher content being present in the more polar fractions. Both the disaccharide and heteropolysaccharide units occurred in components spanning a wide molecular weight range. The former, however, tended to be predominantly associated with high molecular weight material (over 100,000). These results are believed to be consistent with the occurrence in the glomerular basement membrane of both collagen-like and more polar chains, with the former containing both di- and heteropolysaccharide units and the latter having only the polysaccharides. Although disulfide bonds appear to serve as a major crosslink between the peptide chains of this membrane, NH2-terminal amino acid analyses of higher molecular weight fractions suggested that other as yet undefined cross-links may exist."
https://openalex.org/W1602898698,"Abstract The maximum velocity of rat liver phenylalanine hydroxylase is stimulated by the following phospholipids, in order of decreasing potency: lysolecithin, lysophosphatidylserine, phosphatidylserine, and sphingomyelin. Lysolecithin stimulates the maximum velocity 50-fold when the naturally occurring pterin, tetrahydrobiopterin, is used as cofactor, and only 1.15-fold when the synthetic cofactor, 6,7-dimethyltetrahydropterin, is employed. In the presence of tetrahydrobiopterin, lysolecithin also converts the initial velocity-phenylalanine concentration relationship from a sigmoidal to a hyperbolic curve."
https://openalex.org/W2011949324,"Morphine-3-hemisuccinate was synthesized by reaction of morphine with succinic anhydride. This compound was conjugated to bovine serum albumin by the mixed anhydride method, and the degree of conjugation was determined by base hydrolysis of the conjugate, extraction, and measurement of free morphine. An average of 6.5 molecules of morphine were conjugated to each molecule of protein. Eleven rabbits immunized with varying doses of the conjugate were producing antibody 8 weeks later, as determined by a modification of the ammonium sulfate method, which measures primary binding of antigen by antibody."
https://openalex.org/W1481819272,"Abstract Gel filtration studies of 45Ca++ binding to bovine pancreatic deoxyribonuclease A show that the enzyme can bind from 5 to 7 Ca++ ions. At pH 7.5 DNase binds 2 Ca++ ions strongly, with a Kd of 1.4 x 10-5 m, and 3 Ca++ ions weakly, with a Kd of 2 x 10-4 m. At pH 5.5 the protein binds only 1 Ca++ ion strongly, with a Kd of 5 x 10-4 m. DNase has two strong Mg++-binding sites, with a Kd of 2.3 x 10-4 m. Mg++ and Mn++ can compete with one of the two strong Ca++-binding sites present at pH 7.5. They do not complete for the single strong Ca++-binding site present at pH 5.5. Even a 103-fold molar excess of Mn++ or Mg++ does not affect Ca++ binding to the Ca++-specific site."
https://openalex.org/W2048411401,An area in the ventral midbrain tegmentum has been discovered in which electrical stimulation elicits biting attack. The midbrain sites from which attack was elicited correspond well with the zone in the midbrain tegmentum where degeneration was previously observed after lesions were made in lateral hypothalamic attack sites.
https://openalex.org/W1492282552,"Abstract Dihydrofolate reductase from a methotrexate-resistant hamster cell culture was purified to apparent homogeneity by affinity chromatography. A similar procedure was used to prepare enzyme from wild type cells, although the final enzyme protein concentration was too small to be measured. The purified enzymes were not significantly different with regard to substrate specificity, Km values for folate and NADPH, sedimentation coefficient, electrophoretic mobilities at pH values 8.3 and 7.0, turnover number per methotrexate-binding site, and degree of inactivation by antiserum. The rate of radioactive leucine incorporation into the reductase in wild type and resistant cells was compared by specific immunoprecipitation. By this method resistant cells showed a 20-fold increase in the rate of enzyme synthesis. These results indicate that methotrexate-resistant cells accumulate large quantities of a very similar, if not identical, reductase, due at least in part to an increased rate of enzyme synthesis."
https://openalex.org/W1485259183,"Abstract Qualitative and quantitative analyses for pterins (derivatives of 2-amino-4-hydroxypteridine) in human urine were carried out by an improved procedure which involved the use of two new weak ion exchangers, ECTEOLA-Sephadex and phospho-Sephadex. The predominant pterins found in urine were biopterin [6(l-erythro-dihydroxypropyl)pterin] and d-erythroneopterin [6(d-erythrotrihydroxypropyl)pterin], and daily individual outputs of these pterins were 980 µg and 380 µg, respectively. Crithidia fasciculata assays of urine revealed that 1.5 mg of biopterin equivalents were excreted daily. Oral administration of a large amount of folic acid did not affect the amount of these pterins. Furthermore, evidence was obtained which indicated that these pterins occur as the dihydro form. Additional pterins found in urine are l-threoneopterin [6(l-threotrihydroxypropyl)pterin], sepiapterin (6-lactyl-7,8-dihydropterin), pterin, and isoxanthopterin (7-hydroxypterin)."

This treatment does not block the lesser ""stress-induced"" rise in prolactin in response to either. Although nicotine may impair milk production by its effect on prolactin release, it does not appear to block milk ejection from the lactating mammary gland."
https://openalex.org/W1511994659,"Abstract Lactose synthetase is made up of a galactosyl transferase (the A protein) and α-lactalbumin which controls the specificity of the reaction by regulating the affinity of the system for acceptor sugars. We have purified the A protein from bovine skim milk so that it is free of contaminating proteins. This preparation is a single chain glycoprotein of molecular weight 44,000 with a sedimentation coefficient of 3.2 S. The enzyme behaves on disc gel electrophoresis as a family of closely related components all of which are enzymically active and contain carbohydrate. A rapid and sensitive method of studying macromolecular interactions is described. In this procedure the band forming cell of Vinograd is used and the migration of a band of A protein through solutions of α-lactalbumin is followed in the analytical ultracentrifuge equipped with a photoelectric scanner. These experiments show that a complex is formed between A protein and α-lactalbumin which contains one molecule of each protein component. The complex is stable enough to be observed only in the presence of one of the substrates of the enzyme such as UDP-galactose or N-acetylglucosamine. Binding of tetranitromethane-treated α-lactalbumin to A protein in the presence of UDP-galactose could be demonstrated by conventional sedimentation velocity techniques using absorption optics at 430 nm."
https://openalex.org/W1985751472,"By using various methods for comparing polypeptide sequences we find that the evolutionary divergence of rattlesnake cytochrome c from cytochromes c of species in other classes has been more rapid than that of cytochrome c of another reptile, the snapping turtle. This suggests that the evolutionary rate of change of cytochromes c is species-dependent as well as time-dependent."
https://openalex.org/W1513041986,"Abstract Superoxide radical, generated by ultrasonication of buffered aerated aqueous solutions, was detected by its ability to cause the reduction of ferricytochrome c. The rate of reduction of cytochrome c was enhanced by scavengers of hydroxyl radicals, such as formate, and was inhibited by the biological scavenger of superoxide radicals, i.e. superoxide dismutase. Raising the ionic strength of the solutions, subjected to ultrasound, caused an additive and progressive appearance of a superoxide dismutase-insensitive reduction of cytochrome c. It appears that superoxide radicals, generated within the sonically created cavities, can reduce cytochrome c in the solution by two routes. One is independent of ionic strength and can be intercepted by superoxide dismutase, whereas the other, which becomes quantitatively significant as the ionic strength is raised, cannot be interfered with by superoxide dismutase."
https://openalex.org/W1550696452,"Abstract Adenosine kinase (ATP: adenosine 5'-phosphotransferase, EC 2.7.1.20) was partially purified from Ehrlich ascities tumor cells. Initial velocity and product inhibition studies indicated that it catalyzes an ordered Bi Bi reaction, with ATP the first substrate to bind, and ADP the first product to dissociate from, the enzyme."
https://openalex.org/W1989468007,"Rats were given electrical stimulation to the midbrain reticular formation or to the hippocampus 4 seconds after they received shocks contingent on the animals' bar-press responses. They were retested for memory of the shocks 64 seconds or 24 hours after the shocks. The animals that received stimulation to the midbrain reticular formation showed amnesia at the 64-second retest and memory at the 24-hour retest. In contrast, animals that received stimulation to the hippocampus showed memory at the 64-second retest and amnesia at the 24-hour retest. The data support a dual, parallel-processing model of memory."
https://openalex.org/W1530885371,"The association-dissociation equilibrium of the genetic variant β-lactoglobulin A has been studied in an aqueous environment (acetate buffer, pH 4.65, Γ/2 = 0.1) and one in which D2O replaced H2O (pD 4.65). Sedimentation velocity experiments (analyzed with respect to the area distribution of bimodal reaction boundaries and weight-average sedimentation coefficients) indicated that the extent of association was increased in the heavy water medium. The conclusion was supported by results obtained by Sephadex chromatography and by treatment of the Moffitt-Yang parameter, a0, derived from optical rotatory dispersion studies, as a weight-average quantity. The latter method was also used to evaluate enthalpy changes associated with polymer formation in the two environments, the values being -64 and -69 kcal per mole in the H2O and D2O media, respectively. The results are compared with the stabilizing effect of D2O previously reported for other proteins and discussed in terms of increased interactions of both hydrogen bonding and hydrophobic types."
https://openalex.org/W1521996469,"Abstract It has been previously found possible to reconstitute apomyoglobin with cobalt protoporphyrin IX to form oxygen-carrying cobaltoproteins which are presumably isomorphous with the natural hemoproteins. We have here observed the influence of an apoprotein upon the reactivity of a prosthetic group by comparing oxygen binding to the dimethyl ester of cobalt protoporphyrin IX with that to the metalloporphyrin incorporated in apomyoglobin. The protein environment causes no major alteration on the electronic structure of cobalt porphyrin or its oxygen adduct, yet produces a large effect on the stabilities of the cobaltoxygen linkage: at 25°, both whale and horse skeletal muscle cobaltomyoglobin have the same free energy changes upon oxygenation (+2.4 Cal per mole), and a binding constant ∼300 times greater than that for the N-methyl imidazole complex of porphyrin in solution. Furthermore, the two cobaltomyoglobins have substantially different enthalpies and entropies of oxygen binding: for horse the values are ΔH = -11.3 Cal per mole, ΔS = -46 e.u.; for whale ΔH = -13.3, ΔS = -53 e.u. A formal thermochemical cycle is used to obtain the contributions from apoprotein-prosthetic group interactions to the enthalpy and entropy of oxygen binding. These in turn are used to partition the binding enhancement (300-fold) for the two proteins into enthalpic and entropic contributions. The enhancement of oxygen binding in horse cobaltomyoglobin is entirely entropic, whereas that in whale cobaltomyoglobin is roughly balanced between enthalpic (20-fold) and entropic (15-fold) components. We have thus, for the first time, directly observed how two proteins of similar structure and function achieve similar modifications in prosthetic group reactivity through a different balance of enthalpic and entropic factors."
https://openalex.org/W1561948093,"Abstract A cytochrome b5 was isolated from an individual human liver and found to have some 50 additional terminal residues more than previously reported in this protein from human sources. The tryptic digest of this preparation was characterized, and a chromatography system was devised to resolve all of the tryptic peptides by a single colume procedure. The sequence previously established for the human protein is identical with the segment comprised of residues 5 to 92 of the larger cytochrome. The largest cytochrome b5 whose primary structure is known is that of the rabbit. Comparison between this and the human protein shows the human cytochrome to be 4 residues longer at the NH2 terminus and to extend some 37 residues at the COOH terminus. The methods of investigation developed in this study will be helpful in determining how variant cytochrome b5 is in man."
https://openalex.org/W1480062314,"Abstract The circular dichroic (CD) behavior of ferri- and ferrocytochrome c in the presence of methanol, ethanol, and 1-propanol was investigated in an attempt to elucidate some structure-function relationships of the protein. The circular dichroic spectrum of ferricytochrome c in the Soret region exhibited extrema at 417 and 402 nm, which were susceptible to the presence of alcohols in solution. In concentrations of 1-propanol exceeding 6 mole % the protein became modified to a form that showed a positive CD band at 406 nm with a large increase in ellipticity and the disappearance of the 417-nm trough. Similar changes were also observed in solvents containing greater than 13 mole % of ethanol and greater than 21 mole % of methanol. These changes in the Soret region occurred at the same alcohol concentration as those in the aromatic region, thus possibly implicating the aromatic residues in heme crevice conformation changes. Changes in the intrinsic region of ferricytochrome c indicated the enhancement of α helix content at elevated alcohol concentrations. In contrast, ferrocytochrome c under anaerobic conditions showed no changes in either absorption or CD spectra even in 50 volume per cent of 1-propanol. These spectra were, however, converted immediately by higher alcohol concentrations to that resembling the modified ferricytochrome c. The heme of this apparently autoxidized cytochrome c was reactive to carbon monoxide and thus the iron was still in the reduced state. These results indicate that alcohols perturb effectively the interactions between the heme and the protein moiety forming the heme crevice. At increasing alcohol concentrations, ferrocytochrome c which is less susceptible to modification than ferricytochrome c is gradually deformed. Consequently, the heme becomes exposed and reactive toward CO. The similarity in the CD spectra of ferro- and ferricytochrome c under these conditions is a reflection of interactions between the distorted heme coordination sphere and the altered heme environment."
https://openalex.org/W1481585105,"Abstract The formation of mono- and diaddition products resulting from incorporation of rAMP residue(s) at the 3' end of an oligodeoxynucleotide primer catalyzed by the enzyme terminal deoxynucleotidyltransferase is strongly influenced by the primer to substrate ratio in the reaction mixture. Low concentrations (1 to 100 µm) of primer (hexathymidylate) and an excess (1000 µm) of substrate (rATP) cause an exclusive synthesis of the diaddition product. The monoaddition product, undetectable at a very low primer to substrate ratio, however, becomes detectable when the primer concentration approaches one-fifth of the concentration of substrate. In the presence of an excess of primer, mainly the monoaddition product is formed. The utilization of primer can be driven to completion using an excess (1 mm) of rATP and a limited (50 to 100 µm) concentration of primer. The optimum substrate utilization is noticed when there is a 4- to 5-fold excess of primer in the incubation medium. All four common ribonucleotides (rAMP, rGMP, rCMP, rUMP) can be added at the 3' end of an oligodeoxynucleotide primer. Such ribonucleotide terminated primers can then be employed for the initiation of new chains at the ribo-3' terminus of the primer, using all four common deoxynucleoside triphosphates (dATP, dGTP, dCTP, dTTP) giving rise to polydeoxynucleotides covalently linked to the original deoxyoligonucleotide primer by a specific ribonucleotide linkage."
https://openalex.org/W1517038676,"Abstract The effects of divalent metal ions on the circular dichroism (CD) and optical rotatory dispersion (ORD) spectra of bovine pancreatic deoxyribonuclease have been studied. Both the CD and ORD spectra of DNase undergo significant changes below 250 nm upon the binding of calcium to the enzyme. The maximum increase in ellipticity at the 215 nm minimum in the CD spectrum is 950 deg cm2 per decimole. Fifty per cent of the maximum transition occurs near 10-5 m CaCl2. MnCl2 gives a smaller increase at 215 nm of 290 deg cm2 per decimole while MgCl2 causes no change. Calcium is able to protect DNase completely against inactivation by trypsin. Half-maximum protection is achieved near 1.3 x 10-5 m CaCl2. Although some protection against trypsin inactivation is given by MnCl2, and less by MgCl2, at no concentration is either metal able to protect completely. Calcium-induced changes in the CD spectrum and in susceptibility to trypsin must not involve any large changes in shape or volume of the protein since no change in the sedimentation coefficient could be observed. Concentrations of 10-4 m to 10-2 m CaCl2 cause intensification of the CD bands between 310 nm and 250 nm. The same calcium concentration range induces a large ultraviolet difference spectrum in DNase. This indicates that calcium causes significant perturbations of tryptophan and tyrosine residues in DNase."
https://openalex.org/W1640041356,"Abstract Synthesis, degradation, and colchicine-binding characteristics of the microtubule protein were assayed in the cell cycle of two Chinese hamster lines. Levels of microtubule protein in the cell cycle were determined by electrophoresis of purified iodinated microtubule protein together with tritium-labeled whole cell lysates. Synthesis occurred almost exclusively in the G2 phase of the cloned aneuploid V79 line, whereas in the diploid Don line, considerable microtubule protein was synthesized in mid S phase as well as G2. In both Don and V79 cells, colchicine-binding activity displayed a pattern which was in agreement with the changing levels of microtubule protein determined with polyacrylamide gels. Degradation of the protein appeared to be intermittent. Microtubule protein synthesized in G2 phase survived into the ensuing G1 phase but was catabolized rapidly and concomitantly with initiation of DNA replication. The results show an intracyclic rhythm in microtubule synthesis and colchicine-binding activity and give support to the idea that oscillatory behavior of proteins is a common characteristic of the mammalian cell cycle."
https://openalex.org/W2035243112,Amnesia was obtained following electroconvulsive shock in rats trained at one-trial passive avoidance of immersion in ice water. Avoidance behavior was restored when noncontingent foot shock was administered outside the training apparatus. The qualitative differences between ice water and foot shock demonstrate that the agent inducing recovery of memory need not be physically similar to the reinforcer used during training. These findings are interpreted as supporting a retrieval failure view of experimental amnesia.
https://openalex.org/W1559454408,"Abstract Complexes of the Bowman-Birk soybean inhibitor with either trypsin or chymotrypsin and with both of these enzymes were isolated by gel filtration. Amino acid analyses and molecular weight estimates by gel filtration were consistent with the formation of a 1:1 molar complex between inhibitor and trypsin or chymotrypsin and a 1:1:1 molar complex composed of inhibitor, trypsin, and chymotrypsin. The binary complexes were also isolated by affinity chromatography employing insoluble derivatives of trypsin and chymotrypsin. Determination of the residual enzymic activity in solutions of the isolated complexes permitted an evaluation of their dissociation constants."

It is therefore probable that the nucleotide sequence of 5 S rRNA is invariant throughout the Mammalia.
https://openalex.org/W1553681157,"Abstract The effect of the protein denaturant urea upon the circular dichroism spectrum of lysozyme in aqueous solution has been determined. The near-ultraviolet spectrum of native lysozyme in water contained a prominent negative plateau centered at 258 nm. In the spectrum of lysozyme in 8 m urea this plateau was replaced by a broad shoulder with a value for the molar ellipticity at 258 nm 50% less negative. The shape and intensity of the negative plateau were, however, nearly identical for lysozyme in water or 8 m acetamide, an amide of poor denaturing ability. Thus the extent of change in this plateau correlates directly with change in the stability of lysozyme's disulfides toward reduction in aqueous urea or acetamide (Warren, J. R., and Gordon, J. A. (1970) J. Biol. Chem. 245, 4097). Alteration in the near-ultraviolet spectrum of lysozyme in urea solutions was unaccompanied by equivalent change in the far-ultraviolet spectrum of the protein. In contrast, both the near- and far-ultraviolet circular dichroism spectra of bovine serum albumin were altered upon exposure of the protein to increasingly concentrated urea solutions. These circular dichroic data are consistent with the following conclusions: (a) the negative plateau in the near-ultraviolet spectrum of native lysozyme arises primarily from the intramolecular disulfide bonds of the protein; (b) upon interaction of urea with lysozyme a conformational rearrangement occurs around the disulfide bond or bonds with, unlike serum albumin, little or no disruption of α helical structure; (c) lysozyme is not resistant to the denaturing action of urea, although unfolding appears to be restricted to nonhelical portions of the lysozyme molecule."
https://openalex.org/W1570826478,"Spectrophotometric studies of various mixtures of reduced and oxidized forms of myoglobin and cytochrome c revealed that oxymyoglobin is capable of reducing ferricytochrome c at a molar ratio of 1. Other combinations, i.e. oxymyoglobin and ferrocytochrome c; metmyoglobin and ferricytochrome c; or metmyoglobin and ferrocytochrome c showed no spectral change during the time course studied. The pH optimum of the reaction was found to be 7.2. The Q10 was about 5 and the activation energy was about 29 kcal per mole. Aging of oxymyoglobin tended to increase the rate of the reaction, but metmyoglobin added to the reaction mixture had no effect on the system. Antimycin A, amytal, and rotenone were without effect on the reaction. The partial carboxymethylation of histidyl residues of myoglobin increased the reaction rate to twice that of the control. The formation of a complex between oxymyoglobin and cytochrome c was not detected by various physical methods. Oxygen had an inhibitory effect on the reaction of the oxymyoglobin-ferricytochrome c system. This suggested that deoxymyoglobin rather than oxymyoglobin is the reacting species and that the rate-limiting step is the dissociation of oxygen from oxymyoglobin. This was confirmed by measurements showing that deoxymyoglobin reacted with ferricytochrome c at rates significantly greater than those of oxymyoglobin-cytochrome c system. This reaction was shown to proceed in stoichiometric fashion under equilibrium conditions. Carbon monoxide myoglobin was unreactive."
https://openalex.org/W1602891868,"Abstract In an attempt to understand the structure of the active center of β-glucuronidase (EC 3.2.1.31), the behavior of the kinetic parameters of the liver lysosomal enzyme as a function of pH was examined. The pH optimum of the enzyme in the presence of 0.65 m NaCl is 5.1. This dependence of maximal velocity on pH suggests that two dissociable groups are involved, for which the pK values 4.14 and 6.21 were calculated. These values, and those of the heats of dissociation calculated for these two groups, are suggestive of the participation of a carboxylate group and perhaps a carboxyl group in the catalysis. The inactivation of the enzyme by a carbodiimide and by isoxazolium salts is compatible with this hypothesis. The interaction between β-glucuronidase and phenolphthalein-β-d-glucopyranosiduronic acid was found to involve ionic forces, as suggested by the absence of substrate activity or inhibitory effects of p-nitrophenyl-β-d-glucopyranosiduronamide, by the greater inhibitory activity of an isoxazolium salt bearing a sulfonate group than of one that did not contain this group, and by the effect of ionic strength on the kinetic constant Vmax/Km. It was inferred from these findings that a cationic group at the active center of the enzyme is probably involved in attacking the substrate. That this cationic group is probably an imidazolium group was suggested by the inactivation effected by photooxidation, which was pH-dependent, and by diazonium salts."
https://openalex.org/W1574489123,"Abstract A preparation of acetyl-CoA:arylamine N-acetyltransferase from pigeon liver is rapidly and completely inactivated by iodoacetamide with a second order rate constant of 1950 m-1 min-1 at 25°, pH 7.5. This inactivation is prevented by p-nitrophenyl acetate, an active substrate, at concentrations as low as 1.7 x 10-8 m, far below the Ks value of 8.6 x 10-3 m. The protection afforded by 1.67 x 10-3 m p-nitrophenyl acetate is removed to varying extents in the presence of acceptor anilines under conditions in which the enzyme is catalyzing acetyl transfer. Saturating concentrations of p-toluidine bring about complete removal of protection, whereas saturating concentrations of p-cyanoaniline bring about only a 19% removal of protection. This effect of anilines exhibits the same dependence upon aniline concentration as does the rate of the normal catalyzed reaction. It is concluded: (a) there is a kinetically significant acetyl-enzyme intermediate that is not subject to inactivation by iodoacetamide; (b) the acetyl-enzyme intermediate is almost certainly a thiol ester; (c) the rate of inactivation by iodoacetamide provides a probe for the fraction of enzyme that exists as acetyl-enzyme during the steady state turnover of substrates; (d) with p-nitrophenyl acetate and p-toluidine acetyl-enzyme formation is the rate-determining step, whereas with the less reactive acceptor p-cyanoaniline the deacylation step is rate-determining, confirming earlier conclusions from kinetic data."
https://openalex.org/W1539748855,"Abstract The amino acid sequence of a biologically active fragment, A-II, isolated from a fraction of a tryptic digest of bovine growth hormone which has metabolic activity in humans similar to human growth hormone has been determined. The 37 amino acid peptide was cleaved with cyanogen bromide at its single methionine residue to yield two fragments. The larger fragment corresponded to the NH2-terminal and the smaller peptide (nine amino acids) to the COOH-terminal region. The sequence of 37 amino acids was established by analysis of cyanogen bromide fragments, chymotryptic and tryptic peptides. Good homology was found in the sequence between the bovine growth hormone fragment and peptides occurring in human growth hormone and human chorionic somatomammotropin. This suggests that there may be a common active site in growth hormone of various species."
https://openalex.org/W1583160364,"Abstract The relative rates of hydrolysis of monosubstituted phenyl-β-d-glucopyranosiduronic acids (phenyl-β-glucuronides) catalyzed by β-glucuronidase correlate with Hammett values, yielding a biphasic curve with the curve being concave up and with the change-over occurring at the unsubstituted compound. A similar type of plot has not previously been obtained with other enzymes. The relative rates of hydrolysis of p-methoxyphenyl, p-chlorophenyl, and p-nitrophenyl-β-d-glucopyranosiduronic acids, and of the most commonly used substrate, phenolphthalein-β-d-glucopyranosiduronic acid, were compared in D2O and H2O, and it was observed that the pH optimum in D2O shifted towards higher values, with the rate of hydrolysis in D2O decreasing by a factor of 1.7 to 2.0 as compared to that in H2O. These results suggest the involvement of a rate-determining proton transfer in the catalytic steps of the enzymatic reaction. A possible explanation for the change in slope in the Hammett plot is that there is a shift in the relative electronic importance of the general acid-nucleophile portions of the push-pull mechanism."

By selective ammonium sulfate fractionation and preliminary incubation at 35°, it is possible to unmask trehalose-6-P synthetase activity in myxamoebae extracts. This communication re-emphasizes the inadequacy of enzyme profiles and antibiotic inhibition studies as a means of understanding metabolic regulation during cellular differentiation."

https://openalex.org/W1526478202,"Abstract The microsomal enzyme system, aryl hydrocarbon (benzo-[a]pyrene) hydroxylase, is highly inducible by substrate in monolayer cultures of the mouse thymus-spleen cell line, JLSV 5. The rise in enzyme activity is continuously dependent on protein synthesis and requires RNA synthesis during an initial 2-hour period. Selective inhibition of ribosomal RNA synthesis by actinomycin D before and during the presence of the inducer does not interfere with the increase in enzyme activity. Higher levels of actinomycin D ranging from 0.06 to 0.12 µg per ml inhibit both the increase in enzyme activity and the appearance of newly formed RNA in the cytoplasm. Similarly, suppression of ribosomal RNA synthesis by cycloheximide followed by the addition of high levels of actinomycin D and release of the block in protein synthesis does not prevent the increase in enzyme activity. Our results suggest that the early stages of enzyme induction require the synthesis of an RNA of the heterogeneous type whose formation, transport and expression as increased enzyme activity are independent of concomitant ribosomal RNA synthesis and transport to the cytoplasm."
https://openalex.org/W1562070527,"Abstract The circular dichroic spectra of lysozyme with peaks at 289 and 294 nm were shown to be due nearly completely to the tertiary and quaternary structure since they are nearly completely abolished in denaturing amounts of guanidine hydrochloride. Moreover, the shape as well as the magnitude of the dichroic spectra depend on the concentration of lysozyme, indicating that the dichroic chromophores are affected by the self-association of lysozyme (Sophianopoulos, A. J., and van Holde, K. E. (1964) J. Biol. Chem. 239, 2516). If the ellipticity difference Δ[θ] between dilute and concentrated solutions of lysozyme is corrected for the fact that the lysozyme is not completely in dimer form at pH 8, µ = 0.15, 25°, then the concentration-dependent ellipticity change, Δ[θ] = - 148 deg cm2 per decimole at 293 nm and Δ[θ = - 80 deg cm2 per decimole at 286 nm. Moreover, the concentration-dependent Δ[θ] is nearly abolished in the presence of N-acetyl-d-glucosamine, supporting the finding that N-acetyl-d-glucosamine and its polymers abolish the reversible, self-association of lysozyme (Sophianopoulos, A. J. (1969) J. Biol. Chem. 244, 3188). A quantity is proposed, the reduced ellipticity θλ (degrees per absorbance), which is equal to the mean residue ellipticity [θ] divided by the mean residue extinction coefficient, e*, at the same wave length. Using this quantity θλ, the concentration-dependent Δθλ of lysozyme is of the same order of magnitude as found for the change of linear l-Trp-l-Trp to its more rigid, cyclic diketopiperazine (Edelhoch, H., Lippoldt, R. E., and Wilchek, M. (1968) J. Biol. Chem. 243, 4799)."
https://openalex.org/W1512474424,"Abstract A nucleolytic enzyme found in aged bovine plasma albumin Fraction V has been purified approximately 400-fold. The purified preparation hydrolyzes native or denatured deoxyribonucleic acid and ribosomal ribonucleic acid. The three activities appeared to reside in a protein. Native deoxyribonucleic acid is degraded by the enzyme at a somewhat greater rate than is denatured deoxyribonucleic acid or ribosomal ribonucleic acid, and the latter two nucleic acids are hydrolyzed at approximately the same rate. The enzyme is activated by the presence of a divalent cation (Mn2+, Mg2+, or Co2+) and requires both Co2+ (6 x 10-4 m) and Ca2+ (3 x 10-4 m) for the maximal reaction velocity. Potassium phosphate is inhibitory. The optimal pH is around 7.4 with collidine-HCl buffer, and the isoelectric point is 7.3. The molecular weight of the enzyme is approximately 38,000 as determined by gel filtration on Sephadex G-100. The action of the enzyme is predominantly endonucleolytic and the mechanism of digestion seems to be of a single hit type. The reaction products are 5'-phosphate-terminated mononucleotides and oligonucleotides, and the latter are converted largely to mononucleotides after extensive degradation."
https://openalex.org/W1547436042,"Abstract A series of sodium n-alkyl sulfate esters (6, 8, 10, 12, 14, and 16 carbon atoms) were synthesized from the respective alcohols. The relative potency (negative logarithm of detergent concentration producing 50% inhibition) of these sodium dodecyl sulfate analogs for inhibition of bovine liver glutamate dehydrogenase was a linear function of the number of carbon atoms in the detergent. This linear correlation indicated that hydrophobic bonding interactions were a major force in the combination of inhibitor with enzyme. This was substantiated by the observation that a linear correlation was also obtained between log (1/I50) and log P. P was the partition coefficient for the inhibitor between the phases 1-octanol and water. Lengthening the alkyl chain of the anionic detergents beyond 14 carbon atoms did not bring an additional enhancement of inhibition. This indicated a possible size limitation of about 23 A (extended length of C14 analog) or 13 A (for a folded configuration of the detergent) at the detergent binding site on the enzyme. Inhibition occurred without denaturation since changes in protein fluorescence occurred only at much higher cencentrations than those used in the kinetic studies. Denaturation activity by the detergents (log 1/F50, F was the concentration of detergent producing 50% of the change in protein tryptophanyl fluorescence) was also linearly related to the number of carbon atoms in the sulfate ester. Double reciprocal plots of velocity against l-glutamate concentration indicated that sodium hexyl sulfate was a noncompetitive inhibitor. Sodium octyl sulfate gave mixed kinetics between competitive and uncompetitive inhibition. Sodium decyl, dodecyl, tetradecyl, and hexadecyl sulfates were uncompetitive inhibitors. The inhibition by sodium decyl and dodecyl sulfates involved greater cooperativity than that which occurred with the other analogs. Sulfate ion was observed to be a weak competitive inhibitor (Ki, 0.29 m). Sodium laurate and cetyltrimethylammonium bromide were cooperative uncompetitive inhibitors with respect to l-glutamate. Thus, either a positive or negative charge at one end of the hydrophobic alkyl chain will suffice for uncompetitive inhibition by these detergents."
https://openalex.org/W1492275846,"The interaction of cystathionase with the apoprotein of the enzyme aspartate aminotransferase induces, concomitant with inhibition of cystathionase activity, an increase in aminotransferase activity. The interaction between both proteins brings about a change in the amplitude of the circular dichroic band corresponding to pyridoxal-5-P bound to the active center of cystathionase. These spectral changes, taken together with the results of enzymatic assays, clearly establish the transfer as occurring from cystathionase to the catalytic site of aspartate aminotransferase. Light-scattering measurements indicate that the enzyme cystathionase interacts with the apotransaminase to form large molecular weight aggregates."
https://openalex.org/W1583219183,"Abstract Highly purified porcine and bovine luteinizing hormone subunits, LHα and LHβ, have been chromatographed on agarose gel in 6 m guanidine HCl. All nonreduced subunits gave essentially one symmetrical peak, as did reduced bovine LHα and LHβ. In contrast, reduced porcine LHα and LHβ gave three and two peaks, respectively. It is proposed that, whereas bovine LHα and LHβ are single chain proteins, each of the porcine subunits consists of two populations of molecules, one with single peptide chains and the other with two peptide chains linked by disulfide bonds."
https://openalex.org/W1773342765,"A new nuclease activity has been found in aged solution of bovine plasma albumin Fraction V. The nuclease was present in solutions of plasma albumin of all species tested. Bovine serum also exhibited the same nuclease activity after aging. The time course of appearance of nuclease revealed that the activity was detected in a 0.1% bovine plasma albumin solution after 2 or 3 months of aging. A 10% solution was only slightly activated after 5 months and the rate of increase of the activity was slow; however, the activity began to increase rapidly after a short lag period upon the dilution of the solution to a concentration of 1 mg per ml. The final specific activity of the nuclease in bovine plasma albumin of various concentrations reaches nearly the same level after prolonged aging. Gel filtration of bovine plasma albumin solution before and after the aging showed that the nuclease appeared in fractions which had a larger molecular weight than that of the nuclease. These results suggest that the nuclease originates from a specific component of bovine serum by a mechanism where a precursor, presumably enzyme-inhibitor complex, is converted to a catalytically active form by denaturation of an inhibitory component during the storage."
