When parity-time symmetric systems have dissipative components, the interplay between gain and loss can lead to unusual and exotic behavior. Li et al. show theoretically and demonstrate experimentally that such behavior need not be limited to wave systems. Looking at the diffusion of heat, they devised an experimental setup comprising two thermally coupled disks rotating in opposite directions. The thermal energy transported by each disk is strongly coupled to the disk rotating in the opposite direction, providing a return path for the heat wave. For a particular rotation rate, there is an exceptional point where thermal coupling and counterrotating motion balance, resulting in the thermal energy profile being stationary over time.

Zhao et al. used cryo–election microscopy to observe the structure of PTH1R in a complex with a modified form of parathyroid hormone and stimulatory G protein. The structural model helps explain how parathyroid hormone interacts with its receptor and the molecular basis for receptor activation. Science , this issue p. 148"

Some of these interactions are mediated by lipopolysaccharide—a large, complex, and irregular molecule on the surface of most Gram-negative bacteria. Studying the small mustard plant Arabidopsis , Kutschera et al. identified a 3-hydroxydecanoyl chain as the structural element sensed by the plant's lectin receptor kinase. Indeed, synthetic 3-hydroxydecanoic acid alone was sufficient to produce a response. A small microbial metabolite may thus suffice to trigger immune responses. Science , this issue p. 178"
https://openalex.org/W2938527909,"Epitaxial films through spin coating A simple way to coat a surface with a uniform film is by spin coating. The substrate is spun at high speed, and a droplet of solution containing the coating is added at the center, spreads out, and evaporates. This method is used to make polycrystalline inorganic coatings and amorphous films, such as polymers used in lithography. Kelso et al. performed spin coating with single-crystal substrates, carefully controlling the thickness of the spreading solution on the basis of its viscosity and the rotation rate. In this way, they achieved epitaxial growth—in which the crystallites are oriented by the substrate—for perovskites, zinc oxide, and sodium chloride. Science , this issue p. 166"

https://openalex.org/W2939163745,"Adaptation by way of compromise Many plants rely on animal pollinators to spread pollen and increase the genetic diversity of their offspring. However, there are trade-offs, because attracting pollinators may also attract herbivores and deterring predation may diminish floral displays. Ramos and Schiestl studied the interplay between mating system, flowers, and chemical defenses over several generations in Brassica rapa plants (see the Perspective by Ågren). Evolution driven by pollination and herbivory can be observed after only eight generations, suggesting that trade-offs have large evolutionary consequences.

When NOTCH1 binds its ligand DLL4, the intracellular domain (NICD1) is cleaved from the receptor and works with other proteins to regulate gene transcription. In a screen for proteins that interacted with NICD1 in human cells in culture, Lim et al. identified the deubiquitinase USP10. NICD1 is rapidly ubiquitinated and degraded in cells, but interaction of NICD1 with USP10 counteracts ubiquitination of NICD1 and stimulates Notch signaling. Genetic experiments in mice support a role for USP10 in fine-tuning Notch signaling during vascular morphogenesis. Science , this issue p. 188"

We sought to investigate the inflammatory impact of diet on cancer risk using the Dietary inflammatory index (DII) and an adapted Mediterranean diet score (MDS).This population-based, prospective cohort study used self-reported dietary data from the Västerbotten Intervention Programme, including 100,881 participants, of whom 35,393 had repeated measures. Associations between dietary patterns and cancer risk were evaluated using Cox proportional hazards regression. We also used restricted cubic splines to test for potential non-linear associations.A total of 9,250 incident cancer cases were diagnosed during a median follow-up of 15 years. The two dietary patterns were moderately correlated to each other and had similar associations with cancer risk, predominantly lung cancer in men (DII per tertile decrease: Hazard ratio (HR) 0.81 (0.66-0.99), MDS per tertile increase: HR 0.86 (0.72-1.03)), and gastric cancer in men (DII: 0.73 (0.53-0.99), MDS: 0.73 (0.56-0.96)). Associations were, in general, found to be linear. We found no longitudinal association between 10-year change in diet and cancer risk.We confirm small, but consistent and statistically significant associations between a more anti-inflammatory or healthier diet and reduced risk of cancer, including a lower risk of lung and gastric cancer in men. The dietary indexes produced similar associations with respect to the risk of cancer."
https://openalex.org/W2953170534,"Braided river floodplains are highly dynamic ecosystems, where aquatic communities are strongly regulated by the hydrologic regime. So far, however, understanding of how flow variation influences assembly mechanisms remains limited. We collected benthic chironomids and oligochaetes over a year across a lateral connectivity gradient in the semi-natural Tagliamento River (Italy). Four bankfull flood events occurred during the study, allowing the assessment of how flooding and hydrologic connectivity mediate the balance between stochastic and deterministic community assembly. While invertebrate density and richness were positively correlated with connectivity, diversity patterns showed no significant correlation. Species turnover through time increased with decreasing connectivity. Contrary to expectations, hydrologic connectivity did not influence the response of community metrics (e.g. diversity, density) to floods. Invertebrate composition was weakly related to connectivity, but changed predictably in response to floods. Multivariate ordinations showed that faunal composition diverged across the waterbodies during stable periods, reflecting differential species sorting across the lateral gradient, but converged again after floods. Stable hydrological periods allowed communities to assemble deterministically with prevalence of non-random beta-diversity and co-occurrence patterns and larger proportion of compositional variation explained by local abiotic features. These signals of deterministic processes declined after flooding events. This occurred despite no apparent evidence of flood-induced homogenisation of habitat conditions. This study is among the first to examine the annual dynamic of aquatic assemblages across a hydrologic connectivity gradient in a natural floodplain. Results highlight how biodiversity can exhibit complex relations with hydrologic connectivity. However, appraisal of the assembly mechanisms through time indicated that flooding shifted the balance from deterministic species sorting across floodplain habitats, towards stochastic processes related to organisms redistribution and the likely resetting of assembly to earlier stages."
https://openalex.org/W2940381370,"This study aimed to reveal the specific mechanism of extracellular polymeric substances (EPS) in the bioleaching of copper-bearing sulfide ore by moderately thermophilic bacterium Acidithiobacillus caldus. The bioleaching performance of blank control (BC), planktonic cell deficient (PD), attached cell deficient (AD), and EPS deficient (ED) systems were compared, to investigate the specific functions of ""non-contact"" and ""contact"" (including direct contact and, EPS-mediated contact) mechanisms. The detailed mechanics of bioleaching were studied using μx of cell growth, scanning electron microscopy (SEM), X-ray diffraction (XRD), and Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR). The μx of cell growth demonstrated that EPS favors planktonic and attached cell growth. SEM observation revealed that intensive micro-pores on slag benefitted from the ""EPS-mediated contact"" mechanism. XRD identification indicated that additional chemical derivatives were produced via ""EPS-mediated contact"" mechanism, because of the active iron/sulfur metabolism. FTIR analysis revealed that the absorption peaks of C-O-S, sulfate, and S = O, which are closely associated with sulfur metabolism, have significant influences of EPS secretion. Taken together, the ""EPS-mediated contact"" mechanism contributed to almost half of the ""contact"" mechanism efficiency and a quarter of the total bioleaching efficiency. The proposed specific mechanism of EPS can deepen our understanding of similar bioleaching processes."
https://openalex.org/W2939519484,"The islet amyloid polypeptide (IAPP) is a 37-residue peptide hormone whose deposition as amyloid fibrils in the pancreatic islets is associated with type 2 diabetes. Previous studies have suggested that residue Asn-21 plays a critical role in the in vitro self-assembly of IAPP. Herein, we studied structure–self-assembly relationships focusing on position 21 to gain detailed insights into the molecular mechanisms of IAPP self-assembly and to probe the conformational nature of the toxic assemblies associated with β-cell death. Thioflavin T (ThT) fluorescence, CD spectroscopy, and transmission EM analysis revealed that the Asn-21 amide side chain is not required for IAPP nucleation and amyloid elongation, as N21A and N21G variants assembled into prototypical fibrils. In contrast, Asn-21 substitution with the conformationally constrained and turn-inducing residue Pro accelerated IAPP self-assembly. Successive substitutions with hydrophobic residues led to the formation of ThT-negative β-sheet–rich aggregates having high surface hydrophobicity. Cell-based assays revealed no direct correlation between the in vitro amyloidogenicity of these variants and their toxicity. In contrast, leakage of anionic lipid vesicles disclosed that membrane disruption is closely associated with cytotoxicity. We observed that the N21F variant self-assembles into worm-like aggregates, causing loss of lipid membrane structural integrity and inducing β-cell apoptosis. These results indicate that specific intra- and intermolecular interactions involving Asn-21 promote IAPP primary nucleation events by modulating the conformational conversion of the oligomeric intermediates into amyloid fibrils.

The link between islet amyloid and type II diabetes initially led to the postulate that amyloid fibrils mediate β-cell degeneration. This hypothesis was reinforced by the early work of Lorenzo et al.

It has been shown that residue Asn-21 plays a key role in the in vitro self-assembly of IAPP, as its consecutive replacement by Leu, Ser, and Asp inhibits amyloid formation (25Koo B.W. Hebda J.A.

Position 21 is particularly intriguing because it is located in the disordered loop joining the two β-strands in the amyloid conformation (19Luca S. Yau W.M. Leapman R. Tycko R. Peptide conformation and supramolecular organization in amylin fibrils: constraints from solid-state NMR.Biochemistry. 2007; 46 (17979302): 13505-1352210.1021/bi701427qCrossref PubMed Scopus (498) Google Scholar, 20Bedrood S.

The side chain of Asn-21 projects outward from the protofilament core; thus, it could participate in fibril packing. This position is also located at the intersection of the putative 5–20 helical segment and the 20–29 amyloidogenic core. Moreover, Asn-21 is adjacent to Ser-20, for which the Asian mutation S20G is known to increase amyloidogenicity and toxicity (32Sakagashira S. Hiddinga H.J. Tateishi K. Sanke T. Hanabusa T. Nanjo K. Eberhardt N.L. S20G mutant amylin exhibits increased in vitro amyloidogenicity and increased intracellular cytotoxicity compared to wild-type amylin.Am. J.

These observations strongly suggest that this residue plays a critical role in the conformational conversion modulating oligomerization, nucleation, and/or amyloid growth. Accordingly, we performed a structure–assembly relationship study focusing on position 21 by tuning the side-chain physicochemical properties and the local conformational freedom of the backbone. The data indicated that the introduction of a hydrophobic residue at this position locks the peptide into highly toxic β-sheet–rich aggregates, whereas a Pro hastens IAPP self-assembly into nontoxic amyloid fibrils. The present study reveals that Asn-21 acts as a molecular hinge modulating IAPP amyloid formation and cytotoxicity. To gain mechanistic insights into IAPP self-assembly and toxicity to β-cells, we prepared a library of analogs modified at Asn-21. We probed the contribution of the amide side chain by successively incorporating Ala and a negatively (Asp) and a positively (diaminobutyric acid (Dab)) charged residue. Dab was used instead of Lys to maintain the length of the side chain. Asn-21 was substituted with hydrophobic residues with high β-sheet propensity (Phe and Leu) and with Phe capable of π–π interactions. Conformational modifications were introduced to favor turn (Pro, Gly, and d-enantiomer). In fact, d-amino acids are known to promote and/or stabilize turn conformation (33Bourgault S. Vaudry D.

These substitutions (Pro, Gly, Asn, and Aib) modulate the local conformational freedom of the peptide backbone. Rodent IAPP (rIAPP), which contains three Pro residues and is less prone to aggregation and is nontoxic, was used as a negative control (36Westermark P. Engström U. Johnson K.H. Westermark G.T. Betsholtz C. Islet amyloid polypeptide: pinpointing amino acid residues linked to amyloid fibril formation.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 1990; 87 (2195544): 5036-504010.1073/pnas.87.13.5036Crossref PubMed Scopus (705) Google Scholar). The effect of site-specific modifications on self-assembly was initially evaluated by thioflavin T (ThT) fluorescence. ThT is a small dye whose fluorescence emission increases sharply upon its binding to the cross-β-sheet quaternary structure (37LeVine H. Thioflavine T interaction with amyloid β-sheet structures.Amyloid. 1995; 2: 1-610.3109/13506129509031881Crossref Scopus (258) Google Scholar). IAPP amyloid formation can be ascribed to a nucleated polymerization where the three distinctive phases (lag phase, elongation phase, saturation phase) are governed by different kinetics. Dynamic and transient oligomeric species are generated during the lag phase, which is the thermodynamic rate-limiting step. Upon formation of competent oligomer(s), or nuclei, the elongation phase begins, leading to the rapid growth of protofilaments and fibrils until equilibrium is reached. The sigmoidal curve obtained by measuring ThT fluorescence over time is fitted to a Boltzmann sigmoidal, and the lag time can be extracted. Under the conditions of the assay (20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 40 μm ThT, 25 °C, nonbinding surface 96-well plates, 10-min interval between measurements, no agitation), a lag time of 8.6 ± 1.8 h was observed for IAPP at 12.5 μm (Fig. 2) and 4.2 ± 1.2 h at 25 μm (Fig. S1). Introducing a hydrophobic side chain (N21F, N21L) at position 21 abolished the formation of ThT-positive assemblies (Fig. 2A). This is in agreement with the previous work of Miranker and colleagues (25Koo B.W. Hebda J.A. Miranker A.D. Amide inequivalence in the fibrillar assembly of islet amyloid polypeptide.Protein Eng. Des. Sel. 2008; 21 (18299291): 147-15410.1093/protein/gzm076Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). Interestingly, the presence of an amide group on the residue 21 side chain is not a prerequisite for the formation of a ThT-positive cross-β-sheet structure, as the substitution N21A led to a slight acceleration of self-assembly. This result is unexpected, considering that the mutant N21S has been previously shown to self-assemble into ThT-negative amorphous aggregates (25Koo B.W. Hebda J.A. Miranker A.D. Amide inequivalence in the fibrillar assembly of islet amyloid polypeptide.Protein Eng. Des. Sel. 2008; 21 (18299291): 147-15410.1093/protein/gzm076Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). Introducing a negative or a positive charge without altering the side chain length (N21D or N21Dab) inhibited the formation of ThT-positive species. These results indicate that IAPP amyloid formation tolerates the elimination of the position 21 amide group, although it does not allow the introduction of a charged or hydrophobic residue. Considering that IAPP self-assembly occurs in the absence of the Asn-21 amide group, we investigated the role of backbone conformational entropy and side-chain chirality. Introducing the turn-inducing residue Pro led to an acceleration of amyloid assembly, with N21P displaying a lag time of 4.2 ± 0.8 h and a significant increase of ThT end-point fluorescence (Fig. 2B). This observation is intriguing, as a Pro residue is recognized to inhibit amyloid assembly (36Westermark P. Engström U. Johnson K.H. Westermark G.T. Betsholtz C. Islet amyloid polypeptide: pinpointing amino acid residues linked to amyloid fibril formation.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci.

For instance, single-point mutation I26P has been shown to transform IAPP into a potent amyloid inhibitor (28Abedini A. Meng F. Raleigh D.P. A single-point mutation converts the highly amyloidogenic human islet amyloid polypeptide into a potent fibrillization inhibitor.J. Am. Chem. Soc. 2007; 129 (17722920): 11300-1130110.1021/ja072157yCrossref PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar). When Asn-21 was replaced by Aib, known to favor α-helix, amyloid assembly was slowed down to a lag time of over 12 h, with some ThT assays at 12.5 μm showing no increase of fluorescence over 20 h (Fig. S2). Increasing the conformational freedom by incorporating Gly led to kinetics somewhat similar to the N21A analog. It is worth mentioning that N21Aib, N21A, and N21G showed a somewhat high heterogeneity between ThT kinetic assays performed at 12.5 μm (Fig. S2). This observation suggests that the Asn-21 amide function facilitates the IAPP nucleation step through specific intra- or intermolecular hydrogen bonds. Substituting Asn-21 by its corresponding d-amino acid hastened amyloid formation, although it led to a lower fluorescence at the saturation phase. Similar trends were obtained with all peptides used at 25 μm (Fig. S1). These results show that modifications favoring turn conformation (Pro and d-Asn) hasten IAPP self-assembly, whereas restricting the local conformation to the helical space (Aib) delays amyloid formation. The effect of site-specific modifications on conformational transitions was evaluated by CD spectroscopy. Peptides were incubated at room temperature under quiescent conditions (20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 50 μm IAPP), and far-UV CD spectra were recorded. As expected, immediately after solubilization of monomerized/lyophilized IAPP, a random coil CD spectrum was recorded (Fig. 3). No conformational shift was observed during the first 6 h incubation of WT IAPP, whereas a β-sheet secondary structure (single minimum at 220 nm) was observed upon 24 h. The presence of a hydrophobic group (Phe, Leu) confined IAPP into a β-sheet conformation immediately after solubilization. These β-sheet–rich species assembled under these conditions were also ThT-negative (Fig. S3). N21D and N21Dab remained in a random coil conformation, even after 48-h incubation. Although the N21A and N21G mutants showed a ThT-positive signal in the kinetic assays (Fig. 2), the two peptides remained in a random coil conformation after 24 h of incubation, and a β-sheet signal was observed only after 48 h of incubation. Moreover, under the conditions of the CD experiment, a low ThT fluorescence was measured for N21A a"

However, these synthetic agents often possess toxicity leading to various adverse effects.

Because NAD is required throughout the cell, NAMPT might be expected to be distributed in multiple cellular compartments. In dividing Swiss 3T3 and PC-12 cells, NAMPT was predominantly cytosolic, but its localization changed to nuclear when the cell division was stopped (6Kitani T. Okuno S. Fujisawa H.

Translocation of NAMPT from cytosol to nucleus as a result of cell division arrest has also been observed in colorectal carcinoma cells HCT-116 (7Buldak R.J. Skonieczna M. Buldak L. Matysiak N.

These results suggest that the transport of NAMPT between cytosol and nucleus is a regulated process. However, NAMPT’s transport mechanism, relationship to cell cycle, and role in the nucleus are not known. To characterize NAMPT transport and its regulation, we studied endogenous NAMPT and GFP–NAMPT during the cell cycle, after inhibition of cell proliferation, and under stress conditions. We identified a required nuclear localization signal. Our data suggest that inhibition of NAMPT nuclear transport has potential as a therapeutic target in cancer treatment. We studied the cellular localization of NAMPT in three cell types: (i) human hepatoma HepG2 cells, (ii) mouse 3T3-L1 preadipocytes, and (iii) differentiated 3T3-L1 adipocytes. Fusion proteins with either EGFP or HA at the N terminus of NAMPT were constructed. The GFP–NAMPT was transiently transfected, and its localization was analyzed by fluorescence microscopy (Fig. 1A). HA-tagged NAMPT showed similar localization as GFP–NAMPT (Fig. 1B). Fluorescence was detected in both the nucleus and the cytoplasm with a large intercellular variability in nuclear to cytoplasmic proportion. To quantify NAMPT localization, we counted the number of cells with NAMPT located predominantly in the nucleus or cytoplasm according to average fluorescence. In HepG2 hepatocytes, NAMPT was nuclear in 84% and cytoplasmic in 6% of the cells, without clear preferential localization in the rest. In 3T3-L1 preadipocytes, NAMPT was nuclear in 62% of cells and cytoplasmic in 25%. In contrast, in nondividing 3T3-L1 adipocytes, NAMPT localization was nuclear in >99% of cells. These results demonstrate that NAMPT localizes to both the nucleus and cytoplasm in multiple cell types and suggest that the GFP does not affect NAMPT distribution. To further explore NAMPT localization, we produced stably transfected HepG2 cell lines expressing GFP–NAMPT and monitored its localization using live cell imaging microscopy (Movie S1). In cells undergoing mitosis during the initial 24 h, GFP–NAMPT location was scored according to average fluorescence until the next mitosis or up to the end of monitoring, whichever occurred first (Fig. 2A). Prior to mitosis, NAMPT was always predominantly nuclear, whereas newly formed nuclei were free of NAMPT, and for the subsequent 6.9 ± 1.7 h, the average fluorescence was higher in cytoplasm. This period was followed by 5.3 ± 2.6 h of dual localization, and then NAMPT was observed to be predominantly nuclear for 7.6 ± 3.6 h, until the next mitosis. Live-cell microscopy was also performed in 3T3-L1 preadipocytes stably expressing GFP–NAMPT (Movie S2). Two patterns of NAMPT localization were observed (Fig. 2B). In 60% of cells, localization changes were similar to those in HepG2 (4.9 ± 1.5 h cytoplasmic, 3.3 ± 1.5 h dual, and 8.2 ± 3.2 h nuclear). The other 40% of cells skipped the nuclear localization phase. After mitosis, the NAMPT in these cells was cytoplasmic (6.7 ± 3.2 h) and then dual (8.9 ± 3.5 h) before proceeding into the next mitosis. The intensity of nonmitotic nuclear GFP–NAMPT fluorescence appeared to be stable or increasing in both cell lines. DNA content was measured by flow cytometry to determine cell cycle phase (Fig. 2C). In the unsynchronized HepG2 cells carrying GFP–NAMPT, 39.5 ± 2.6% were in the G1/G0 phase, 40.0 ± 2.5% were in the S phase, and 20.5 ± 1.3% in the G2/M phase. In unsynchronized GFP–NAMPT 3T3-L1 cells, 46.8 ± 1.6% were in the G1/G0 phase, 26.7 ± 1.9% were in the S phase, and 26.5 ± 2.2% were in the G2/M phase. In these unsynchronized cultures, the percentage of cells in a phase reflects the relative duration of the phase. Localization of endogenous NAMPT was determined in unsynchronized cultures of HepG2 cells. These cells were pretreated with a FUCCI cell cycle sensor kit to determine the cell cycle phase (Fig. 2, D and E). Most of cells (79 ± 16%) in the G1/G0 phase had higher NAMPT level in cytosol. 71 ± 18% of cells in the early S phase and all cells in the late S, G2, and M phases had NAMPT predominantly in nucleus. This result was similar to a previous experiment utilizing GFP–NAMPT; therefore, overexpression of GFP–NAMPT did not significantly affect cell cycle–associated changes in NAMPT localization. Taken together, these results demonstrate that NAMPT changes its cellular localization in a cell cycle–dependent manner. We next analyzed the effect of cell cycle inhibitors on NAMPT localization (Fig. 3, A and B). Aphidicolin inhibits DNA replication and arrests at the S phase (10Baranovskiy A.G. Babayeva N.D. Suwa Y. Gu J. Pavlov Y.I. Tahirov T.H. Structural basis for inhibition of DNA replication by aphidicolin.Nucleic Acids Res. 2014; 42 (25429975): 14013-1402110.1093/nar/gku1209Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar), RO-3306 inhibits cyclin-dependent kinase 1 and arrests cells at the G2/M phase (11Vassilev L.T. Tovar C. Chen S. Knezevic D. Zhao X. Sun H. Heimbrook D.C. Chen L. Selective small-molecule inhibitor reveals critical mitotic functions of human CDK1.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2006; 103 (16818887): 10660-1066510.1073/pnas.0600447103Crossref PubMed Scopus (544) Google Scholar), and culture at confluency and differentiation both arrests cells at the G1/G0 phase. Cell cycle inhibition was confirmed by flow cytometry (Table S1). All four manipulations increased nuclear NAMPT. NAMPT was predominantly nuclear in 22% of control cells versus 86% of aphidicolin-treated cells, 78% of RO-3306–treated cells, 67% of confluent cells, and 100% of differentiated cells. All of the cell cycle inhibitors increased SIRT activity (Fig. 3C). Confluency reduced cellular NAD levels and NAMPT and NMNAT1 mRNA expression (Fig. 3D and Tables S2, S3, S4, and S6). To test the hypothesis that DNA damage and stress conditions affect nuclear transport of NAMPT, we monitored NAMPT localization after DNA damage by UV light or BrdU (12Kaufman E.R. Reversion analysis of mutations induced by 5-bromodeoxyuridine mutagenesis in mammalian cells.Mol. Cell. Biol. 1985; 5 (3837841): 3092-309610.1128/MCB.5.11.3092Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar) or induction of oxidative (H2O2) or dicarbonyl (methylglyoxal (MG)) stress (Fig. 3E). Each treatment increased number of cells with predominantly nuclear NAMPT: UV light, BrdU, H2O2, and MG to 70, 67, 38, and 72%, respectively, compared with 22% in controls. Increased PARP activity was also observed in all four conditions (Fig. 3F). UV illumination and H2O2 (the more aggressive DNA-damaging agents) reduced NAD level and mRNA expression of NAMPT and NMNAT1 (Fig. 3G and Tables S2, S3, and S5). In agreement with these results is NAMPT localization after transient plasmid transfection (Fig. 1), where NAMPT was nuclear at 62% of cells. Transfection is another example of stress condition associated with activation of nuclear processes. We further tested effect of SIRT6 and PARP inhibition on NAMPT localization. Trichostatin A (TSA) is an inhibitor of SIRT6 and class I and class II histone deacetylases (13Wood M. Rymarchyk S. Zheng S. Cen Y. Trichostatin A inhibits deacetylation of histone H3 and p53 by SIRT6.Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 2018; 638 (29233643): 8-1710.1016/j.abb.2017.12.009Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). TSA at 0.75 nmol·liter−1, which did not affect cell viability, increased the number of cells with cytoplasmic NAMPT localization (Fig. 3H) and increased histone H3 acetylation (Fig. 3I). High doses of TSA (75 nmol·liter−1), which caused ∼50% reduction in cell viability, had the opposite effect and substantially increased number of cells with predominantly nuclear NAMPT to 66% (data not shown). Inhibitor of PARP 3-aminobenzamide (3AB) reduced PARP activity but did not affect NAMPT localization (Fig. 3, H, J, and K). NAMPT enzymatic activity inhibitor FK866 increased histone H3 acetylation but had no effect on NAMPT localization or PARP activity (Fig. 3, H–K). Overall, these results show that NAMPT is transported into nucleus under situations with increased requirement for nuclear NAD. Sequence analysis of NAMPT suggested two possible nuclear localization signals, 35SYFECREKKTENSKVRKVKYEE56 and 423KRSKKGR429 (Fig. 4A). Clustered amino acid substitution (50RKVK to GAVA or 424RSKK to ASGA) were introduced into GFP–NAMPT, producing GFP–NAMPTGAVA and GFP–NAMPTASGA. After transient transfection of HepG2 cells, GFP–NAMPTGAVA remained mostly nuclear (nuclear in 74 ± 11% of cells and cytoplasmic in 9 ± 4% of cells), not significantly different from GFP–NAMPTWT. In contrast, localization of GFP–NAMPTASGA was almost completely cytoplasmic (nuclear in 12 ± 7% of cells and cytoplasmic in 77 ± 12% of cells) (Fig. 4B). The fluorescence intensities of GFP–NAMPTGAVA and GFP–NAMPTASGA were similar to GFP–NAMPTWT, suggesting that the introduced substitutions did not affect protein expression or stability. Region 424RSKK is located on the surface of NAMPT and separated from its active site (Fig. 4C). These results demonstrate that the 423KRSKKGR429 region in NAMPT contains a required nuclear localization signal. To explore the functional role of NAMPT nuclear localization, we generated stable HepG2 cell lines overexpressing NAMPTWT, NAMPTASGA, and NAMPT carrying amino acid substitutions in the active site (Asp219 to Ala, Arg311 to Ala, and Asp313 to Ala) producing enzymatically inactive NAMPT (NAMPTKO) (14Khan J.A. Tao X. Tong L. Molecular basis for the inhibition of human NMPRTase, a novel target for anticancer agents.Nat. Struct. Mol.

The three independent clones expressing NAMPTWT, NAMPTASGA, and NAMPTKO had similar levels of NAMPT protein expression approximately five times that of the endogenous enzyme (Fig. 5A). Overexpression of NAMPTWT or NAMPTASGA similarly increased the activity of NAD salvage pathway ∼6-fold, whereas NAMPTKO overexpression had no effect on this activity (Fig. 5B). These data suggest that the 424RSKK to ASGA substitution does not affect NAMPT enzymatic activity and verified that NAMPTKO is enzymatically inactive. Exogenous NAMPT mRNA levels had high variability and were slightly higher in NAMPTKO (Fig. 5C). Overexpression of NAMPTWT or NAMPTASGA produced ∼2-fold higher cellular NAD concentrations compared with control or NAMPTKO cells (Fig. 5D). Expression of exogenous NAMPT had no effect on the mRNA levels of endogenous NAMPT or NMNAT1 (Fig. 5, E and F). Taken together, these results demonstrate that the NAMPTWT, NAMPTASGA, and NAMPTKO are comparably overexpressed. Like transiently expressed NAMPT, the stably expressed NAMPTWT was mostly nuclear (nuclear in 82 ± 10% of cells and cytoplasmic in 7 ± 5% of cells), whereas the NAMPTASGA mutant localization was almost entirely cytoplasmic (nuclear in 5 ± 3% of cells and cytoplasmic in 86 ± 9% of cells) (Fig. 5G). Overexpression of NAMPTWT accelerated growth, with a 30% decrease in generation time. In contrast, overexpression of NAMPTASGA, as well as NAMPTKO, did not affect growth (Fig. 5H). Accelerated growth in cells overexpressing NAMPTWT was associated with increased proportion of cells in the G1/G0 phase (Table S7). Overexpression of either NAMPTWT or NAMPTASGA but not NAMPTKO made cells less sensitive to FK866, a NAMPT enzymatic activity inhibitor. Importantly, NAMPTWT relative to NAMPTASGA overexpression made cells significantly more resistant, when ∼10 times higher concentration of FK866 was required to achieve the same effect on cell viability (Fig. 5I). Overexpression NAMPTWT reduced histone H3 acetylation by 64%, whereas in NAMPTASGA cells, the reduction was only 38%, and no reduction was observed in NAMPTKO (Fig. 5J). NAMPTWT cells, but not NAMPTASGA cells, had slightly higher SIRT activity (Table S7). PARP activity was increased by 46% in NAMPTWT overexpressing cells and did not change in NAMPTASGA or NAMPTKO cells (Fig. 5K), suggesting that nuclear localization and enzymatic activity are required for these effects (Fig. 5, H and I). NAMPT is localized in the nucleus in nondividing adipocytes and is present in both the cytoplasm and the nucleus in dividing cells. This suggests that NAMPT is transported between the nucleus and the cytoplasm in a cell cycle–dependent manner. Supporting literature includes the observation that NAMPT translocates from cytosol to nucleus after cell division arrest (6Kitani T. Okuno S. Fujisawa H. Growth phase-dependent changes in the subcellular localization of pre–B-cell colony-enhancing factor.FEBS Lett. 2003; 544 (12782293): 74-7810.1016/S0014-5793(03)00476-9Crossref PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar, 7Buldak R.J.

Histochem. 2014; 58 (25308845): 2408Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar). We monitored NAMPT localization continuously in cells that were naturally progressing through the cell cycle. NAMPT was lowest in newly formed nuclei right after mitosis and increased thereafter. This suggests that mitosis regulates nuclear NAMPT levels. Furthermore, NAMPT was present in the nucleus in the early S phase, suggesting a possible role of this enzyme in DNA replication. The requirement of NAD for nuclear processes is a likely reason for NAMPT nuclear localization. Nicotinamide is product of all nonredox NAD-consuming reactions (3Cantó C. Menzies K.J. Auwerx J. NAD+ metabolism and the control of energy homeostasis: a balancing act between mitochondria and the nucleus.Cell Metab. 2015; 22 (26118927): 31-5310.1016/j.cmet.2015.05.023Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (857) Google Scholar), and in mammalian cells, most of the NAD is synthetized from nicotinamide by a salvage pathway of NAMPT and nicotinamide mononucleotide adenylyl transferase (NMNAT) (16Di Stefano M. Conforti L. Diversification of NAD biological role: the importance of location.FEBS J. 2013; 280 (23848828): 4711-472810.1111/febs.12433Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). There is one NAMPT isoform and three NMNAT isoforms: nuclear, NMNAT 1; Golgi surface, NMNAT 2; and mitochondrial, NMNAT 3 (17Berger F. Lau C. Dahlmann M. Ziegler M. Subcellular compartmentation and differential catalytic properties of the three human nicotinamide mononucleotide adenylyltransferase isoforms.J. Biol.

Compartmentalization of enzymes of a single metabolic pathway is a general feature of living organisms, which increases the rate and efficiency of synthesis (18Zecchin A. Stapor P.C. Goveia J. Carmeliet P. Metabolic pathway compartmentalization: an underappreciated opportunity?.Curr. Opin. Biotechnol. 2015; 34 (25499800): 73-8110.1016/j.copbio.2014.11.022Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). Rapid turnover of NAD occurs in the nucleus (19Cambronne X.A. Stewart M.L. Kim D. Jones-Brunette A.M. Morgan R.K. Farrens D.L. Cohen M.S. Goodman R.H. Biosensor reveals multiple sources for mitochondrial NAD+.Science. 2016; 352 (27313049): 1474-147710.1126/science.aad5168Crossref PubMed Scopus (239) Google Scholar). Because of nuclear colocalization of NAMPT with NMNAT1, it should be possible to quickly restore NAD from nicotinamide. NMN (product of NAMPT), NAD, and nicotinamide can pass through the nuclear pore by passive diffusion (19Cambronne X.A. Stewart M.L. Kim D. Jones-Brunette A.M. Morgan R.K. Farrens D.L. Cohen M.S.

The two main classes of nuclear enzymes utilizing NAD are poly(ADP-ribosyl) polymerases and NAD-dependent deacetylases, also known as SIRTs. These enzymes regulate DNA repair, chromatin structure, transcription, replication, telomere length, cell division, and circadian rhythm (21Boehler C. Gauthier L.R. Mortusewicz O. Biard D.S.

SIRTs are the important histone deacetylases and key factors for chromatin condensation and heterochromatin stabilization (26Vaquero A. The conserved role of sirtuins in chromatin regulation.Int. J.

Chromosomes are maximally condensed during mitotic segregation, then decondense, and are mostly open during replication (28Williamson W.D. Pinto I. Histones and genome integrity.Front. Biosci. (Landmark Ed.). 2012; 17 (22201786): 984-99510.2741/3969Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar). To reflect these changes, SIRT should have maximal activity prior to mitosis and lower activity in the postmitotic phase. Our results showing changes of NAMPT localization during naturally progressing cell cycle are in agreement with these cell cycle–dependent changes in chromatin structure. NAMPT nuclear content mimics different requirements of NAD because of SIRT-induced changes in chromatin structure during the cell cycle. Hence, these changes in chromatin structure are possible reasons for different NAMPT localization depending on the cell cycle. One of the aims of this study was to find conditions that increase NAMPT nuclear content. Cell cycle inhibition at the G1/G0 (confluency and differentiation), S (aphidicolin), and G2/M phases (RO-3306) increased NAMPT nuclear localization. This suggests that NAMPT is transported into nucleus in all phases of cell cycle and/or that cell cycle arrest activates transport of NAMPT into nucleus. Concurrently with increased NAMPT nuclear localization, we found increased SIRT activity after all types of cell cycle inhibition. This indicates that increased SIRT-mediated NAD degradation should be at least partly covered by increased NAD synthesis within the nucleus. TSA, an inhibitor of SIRT6 and class I and class II histone deacetylases slightly increased cytoplasmic NAMPT. SIRT6 is located in the nucleus and is crucial for maintaining genomic integrity (13Wood M. Rymarchyk S. Zheng S. Cen Y. Trichostatin A inhibits deacetylation of histone H3 and p53 by SIRT6.Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 2018; 638 (29233643): 8-1710.1016/j.abb.2017.12.009Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). Increased cytoplasmic NAMPT after TSA treatment suggests a possible relationship between SIRT6 activity, histone deacetylation, and NAMPT nuclear transport. We hypothesized that NAMPT is transported into nucleus to provide nuclear NAD, which led us to test NAMPT localization un"
https://openalex.org/W2939531350,"Single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) are the most common form of genetic variation in humans and drive phenotypic variation. Due to evolutionary conservation, SNPs and indels (insertion and deletions) are depleted in functionally important sequence elements. Recently, population-scale sequencing efforts such as the 1000 Genomes Project and the Genome of the Netherlands Project have catalogued large numbers of sequence variants. Here, we present a systematic analysis of the polymorphisms reported by these two projects in different coding and non-coding genomic elements of the human genome (intergenic regions, CpG islands, promoters, 5’ UTRs, coding exons, 3’ UTRs, introns, and intragenic regions). Furthermore, we were especially interested in the distribution of SNPs and indels in direct vicinity to the transcription start site (TSS) and translation start site (CSS). Thereby, we discovered an enrichment of dinucleotides CpG and CpA and an accumulation of SNPs at base position −1 relative to the TSS that involved primarily CpG and CpA dinucleotides. Genes having a CpG dinucleotide at TSS position -1 were enriched in the functional GO terms “Phosphoprotein”, “Alternative splicing”, and “Protein binding”. Focusing on the CSS, we compared SNP patterns in the flanking regions of canonical and alternative AUG and near-cognate start sites where we considered alternative starts previously identified by experimental ribosome profiling. We observed similar conservation patterns of canonical and alternative translation start sites, which underlines the importance of alternative translation mechanisms for cellular function."
https://openalex.org/W2939777620,"Forest cover has been associated with higher dietary diversity and better diet quality in Africa. Anemia prevalence among women of reproductive age in sub-Saharan Africa is very high and diet is one known contributor of a high prevalence rate. We investigated whether living in communities with high forest cover was associated with better diet quality and lower anemia prevalence among women of reproductive age in Southwest Cameroon.We conducted a cross-sectional survey of 247 women of reproductive age from four forest-based villages (n = 126) and four non-forest villages (n = 121). We assessed the Hemoglobin (Hb) levels, anthropometric status, and diet (by 24-hour recall), as well as anemia-related morbidity and socio-demographic characteristics. Differences between groups were assessed with Pearson's chi-square and independent T-tests. We used a number of multivariate regression models to estimate the impacts of forest proximity on adjusted hemoglobin status of women of reproductive age, as well as to identify the most likely pathway through which forest proximity was important.We found that women living in forest communities had higher adjusted hemoglobin levels (mean hemoglobin concentration 11.10±1.53 g/dl vs.10.68±1.55g/dl; p = 0.03 for women forest and non-forest communities respectively). Moderate to severe anemia prevalence was significantly higher in women living in the non-forest villages compared to women in forest villages (forest 63% vs. 73%; p = 0.04). Compared with women from non-forest villages, women from forest-based villages had consumed significantly more vitamin A rich fruits and vegetables and animal source foods, and more of these came from the forest (as opposed to the farm or purchased sources). We found that the consumption of Gnetum africanum (Eru), a leafy green vegetable that grows in forests of the Congo Basis, was best able to account for the higher levels of adjusted hemoglobin in women in forest communities.This study contributes to the growing evidence that in some circumstances, forests make important contributions to diet quality and nutrition. The results of this study suggest that plant foods from the forest may make important contributions to iron intake and reduce the risk of anemia in women. Efforts to prevent forest loss and maintain ecosystem services are warranted to enhance nutrition and health of forest-based communities."
https://openalex.org/W2902147340,"Human Immunodeficiency Virus infection (HIV) remains a public health concern in Cameroon that requires regular surveillance for informed policy-making to guide programmatic interventions. Using data from the 2016 HIV national sentinel survey in Cameroon, we ascertained HIV prevalence and factors associated with risk of infection among pregnant women.A cross-sectional study was conducted throughout 2016 in the 10 regions of Cameroon, targeting 7000 first antenatal care (ANC-1) attendees (4000 from urban and 3000 from rural areas) in 60 sentinel health facilities. HIV serological test was performed using the national serial algorithm at the National Reference Laboratory (NRL). Prevalence was determined, and multivariate logistic regression was used to assess determinants of HIV infection, with p-value<0.05 considered statistically significant.Of the 7000 targeted participants, a total of 6859 first ANC-1 attendees were enrolled (98.0% sampling coverage). Median age was 26 [IQR: 21-30] years and 47,40% had a secondary school level of education. The national prevalence of HIV was 5.70% (95% CI: 4.93-6.40) and range from 9.7% in East region to 2.6% in North region. The prevalence was 5.58% (95% CI: 95%: 4.88-6.35) in urban and 5.87% (95% CI: 5.04-6.78) in rural settings. Factors that were associated with HIV infection included marital status, women who were married or living with their partner are less likely to be infected than singles women (aOR = 0.60; 95% CI: 0.46-0.78), multiparity [aOR = 1.5(95%CI:1.0-2.2)] and been living in the Centre, East, North-west and South-west regions. HIV infection was also significantly associated with age, with the risk of being infected increasing with age.Pregnant women in Cameroon are still disproportionately infected with HIV compared with the general population (prevalence 4.3%). Preventive actions to curb the epidemic amongst pregnant women should prioritize interventions targeting single pregnant women, who are older, and residing particularly in the Centre, East, North West and South West regions of the country."
https://openalex.org/W2936338658,"In humans, mitochondrial iron–sulfur cluster biosynthesis is an essential biochemical process mediated by the assembly complex consisting of cysteine desulfurase (NFS1), LYR protein (ISD11), acyl-carrier protein (ACP), and the iron–sulfur cluster assembly scaffold protein (ISCU2). The protein frataxin (FXN) is an allosteric activator that binds the assembly complex and stimulates the cysteine desulfurase and iron–sulfur cluster assembly activities. FXN depletion causes loss of activity of iron–sulfur-dependent enzymes and the development of the neurodegenerative disease Friedreich’s ataxia. Recently, a mutation that suppressed the loss of the FXN homolog in Saccharomyces cerevisiae was identified that encodes an amino acid substitution equivalent to the human variant ISCU2 M140I. Here, we developed iron–sulfur cluster synthesis and transfer functional assays and determined that the human ISCU2 M140I variant can substitute for FXN in accelerating the rate of iron–sulfur cluster formation on the monothiol glutaredoxin (GRX5) acceptor protein. Incorporation of both FXN and the M140I substitution had an additive effect, suggesting an acceleration of distinct steps in iron–sulfur cluster biogenesis. In contrast to the canonical role of FXN in stimulating the formation of [2Fe–2S]–ISCU2 intermediates, we found here that the M140I substitution in ISCU2 promotes the transfer of iron–sulfur clusters to GRX5. Together, these results reveal an unexpected mechanism that replaces FXN-based stimulation of the iron–sulfur cluster biosynthetic pathway and suggest new strategies to overcome the loss of cellular FXN that may be relevant to the development of therapeutics for Friedreich’s ataxia.

Here, we developed iron–sulfur cluster synthesis and transfer functional assays and determined that the human ISCU2 M140I variant can substitute for FXN in accelerating the rate of iron–sulfur cluster formation on the monothiol glutaredoxin (GRX5) acceptor protein. Incorporation of both FXN and the M140I substitution had an additive effect, suggesting an acceleration of distinct steps in iron–sulfur cluster biogenesis. In contrast to the canonical role of FXN in stimulating the formation of [2Fe–2S]–ISCU2 intermediates, we found here that the M140I substitution in ISCU2 promotes the transfer of iron–sulfur clusters to GRX5. Together, these results reveal an unexpected mechanism that replaces FXN-based stimulation of the iron–sulfur cluster biosynthetic pathway and suggest new strategies to overcome the loss of cellular FXN that may be relevant to the development of therapeutics for Friedreich’s ataxia."
https://openalex.org/W2937069679,"The menaquinone biosynthetic pathway presents a promising drug target against Mycobacterium tuberculosis and potentially other Gram-positive pathogens. In the present study, the essentiality, steady state kinetics of MenA from M. tuberculosis and the mechanism of MenA inhibition by Ro 48–8071 were characterized. MenA [isoprenyl diphosphate:1,4-dihydroxy-2-naphthoate (DHNA) isoprenyltransferase] catalyzes a critical reaction in menaquinone biosynthesis that involves the conversion of cytosolic DHNA, to membrane bound demethylmenaquinone by transferring a hydrophobic 45-carbon isoprenoid chain (in the case of mycobacteria) to the ring nucleus of DHNA. Rv0534c previously identified as the gene encoding MenA in M. tuberculosis complemented a menA deletion in E. coli and an E. coli host expressing Rv0534c exhibited an eight-fold increase in MenA specific activity over the control strain harboring empty vector under similar assay conditions. Expression of Rv0534c is essential for mycobacterial survival and the native enzyme from M. tuberculosis H37Rv was characterized using membrane preparations as it was not possible to solubilize and purify the recombinant enzyme. The enzyme is absolutely dependent on the presence of a divalent cation for optimal activity with Mg+2 being the most effective and is active over a wide pH range, with pH 8.5 being optimal. The apparent Km values for DHNA and farnesyl diphosphate were found to be 8.2 and 4.3 μM, respectively. Ro 48–8071, a compound previously reported to inhibit mycobacterial MenA activity, is non-competitive with regard to DHNA and competitive with regard to the isoprenyldiphosphate substrate."
https://openalex.org/W2936115553,"To gain a greater understanding of oral squamous cell carcinoma (OSCC) we investigated the actions of all-trans-retinoic acid (RA; a retinoid), bexarotene (a pan-RXR agonist), and forkhead box (FOX) transcription factors in human OSCC-derived cell lines. RA and bexarotene have been shown to limit several oncogenic pathways in many cell types. FOXO proteins typically are associated with tumor suppressive activities, whereas FOXM1 acts as an oncogene when overexpressed in several cancers. RA and/or bexarotene increased the transcript levels of FOXO1, FOXO3A, and TRAIL receptors; reduced the transcript levels of FOXM1, Aurora kinase B (AURKB), and vascular endothelial growth factor A (VEGFA); and decreased the proliferation of OSCC-derived cell lines. Also, RA and/or bexarotene influenced the recruitment of FOXO3A and FOXM1 to target genes. Additionally, FOXM1 depletion reduced cell proliferation, decreased transcript levels of downstream targets of FOXM1, and increased transcript levels of TRAIL receptors. Overexpression of FOXO3A decreased proliferation and increased binding of histone deacetylases (HDACs) 1 and 2 at the FOXM1, AURKB, and VEGFA promoters. This research suggests novel influences of the drugs RA and bexarotene on the expression of FOXM1 and FOXO3A in transcriptional regulatory pathways of human OSCC."

However, the effects of decreased fatty acid oxidation on skeletal muscle function, histology, use of alternative fuels, and mitochondrial function and morphology are unclear. We observed that Acsl1M−/− mice have impaired voluntary running capacity and muscle grip strength and that their gastrocnemius muscle contains myocytes with central nuclei, indicating muscle regeneration. We also found that plasma creatine kinase and aspartate aminotransferase levels in Acsl1M−/− mice are 3.4- and 1.5-fold greater, respectively, than in control mice (Acsl1flox/flox), indicating muscle damage, even without exercise, in the Acsl1M−/− mice. Moreover, caspase-3 protein expression exclusively in Acsl1M−/− skeletal muscle and the presence of cleaved caspase-3 suggested myocyte apoptosis. Mitochondria in Acsl1M−/− skeletal muscle were swollen with abnormal cristae, and mitochondrial biogenesis was increased. Glucose uptake did not increase in Acsl1M−/− skeletal muscle, and pyruvate oxidation was similar in gastrocnemius homogenates from Acsl1M−/− and control mice. The rate of protein synthesis in Acsl1M−/− glycolytic muscle was 2.1-fold greater 30 min after exercise than in the controls, suggesting resynthesis of proteins catabolized for fuel during the exercise. At this time, mTOR complex 1 was activated, and autophagy was blocked. These results suggest that fatty acid oxidation is critical for normal skeletal muscle homeostasis during both rest and exercise. We conclude that ACSL1 deficiency produces an overall defect in muscle fuel metabolism that increases protein catabolism, resulting in exercise intolerance, muscle weakness, and myocyte apoptosis.

The aim of this study was to determine the acute effect of a single tennis match on shoulder rotation ROM, isometric strength and serve speed. Twenty-six professional tennis players participated in the study (20.4±4.4 years; 10.5±3.2 years tennis expertise; 20.5±5.4 h/week training). Passive shoulder external (ER-ROM) and internal rotation ROM (IR-ROM), ER and IR isometric strength were measured before and after a single tennis match (80.3±21.3 min) in both shoulder´s. Moreover, the total arc of motion (TAM) and ER/IR strength ratio were calculated. Video analysis was used to assess the number of serves and groundstrokes, while a radar gun was utilized to measure maximal ball speed. In the dominant shoulder, compared to pre-match levels, IR-ROM was significantly reduced (-1.3%; p = 0.042), while ER-ROM (5.3%; p = 0.037) and TAM (3.1%; p = 0.050) were significantly increased. In the non-dominant shoulder, ER-ROM (3.7%; p = 0.006) was increased. Furthermore, in the dominant shoulder, the isometric ER strength was significantly reduced after the match (-4.8%; p = 0.012), whereas serve speed was not significantly reduced after match (-1.16%; p = 0.197). A single tennis match leads to significant reductions in shoulder ROM (e.g., IR of the dominant shoulder) and isometric strength (e.g., ER of the dominant shoulder). This study reveals the importance of recovery strategies prescription aiming at minimize post-match alteration in the shoulders."
https://openalex.org/W2939182104,"Cystic fibrosis (CF) is the one of the most common inherited diseases. It affects around 10,000 people in the UK, and the median survival age is 47. Recent developments making use of longitudinal patient registry data are producing more detailed and relevant information about predicted life expectancy in CF based on current age and clinical measurements. The objective of this study was toconduct an online survey of adults with CF living in the UK using a web-based questionnaire to investigate: (i) if and how they access information on life expectancy; (ii) what they use it for; (iii) if they want more personalised information on life expectancy or the time until other milestones. The survey was advertised through the Cystic Fibrosis Trust using social media. There were 85 respondents, covering men (39%) and women (61%) aged 16–65. 75% had received information on life expectancy either from their CF care team (34%) or other sources (71%), the most common being the Cystic Fibrosis Trust website and research literature. Most people who received information found it to be beneficial and reported using it in a variety of ways, including to plan strategies for maintaining as best health as possible and to psychologically manage current health status. 82% of respondents were interested in more personalised information about their life expectancy, and participants also noted interest in other outcomes, including time to needing transplant or reaching a low level of lung function. Themes arising in text responses included the importance of good communication of information, the difficulty of relating general information to one’s own circumstances, and a desire for increased information on factors that impact on survival in CF. As an outcome from this work, research is underway to establish how information on life expectancy can be presented to people with CF in an accessible way."

A cross-sectional study was conducted using convenience sampling. The outcomes were responses to the knowledge and attitude questions, and the main outcome variables were the total scores for knowledge and attitudes toward ADs. This study included 281 physicians and nurses (60.5%). Most physicians were men (95, 80.5%), whereas most nurses were women (147, 86.5%). The mean (standard deviation; SD) total knowledge score was 6.8 (4.0) for physicians and 9.1 (3.0) for nurses (p < 0.001). There was a significant difference in the total knowledge score between nurses and physicians, with an adjusted mean difference of 1.54 (95% confidence interval [CI]; 0.08–2.97). Other significant independent predictors of knowledge of ADs were female sex (1.60, 95% CI; 0.27–3.13) and education level (master’s versus bachelor’s: 1.26, 95% CI; 0.30–2.33 and Ph.D. versus bachelor’s: 2.22, 95% CI; 0.16–4.52). Nurses’ attitudes appeared to be significantly more positive than those of physicians, and the mean total attitude score (SD) was 19.5 for nurses (6.2) and 15.1 (8.1) for physicians (p < 0.001).

However, the NPC WNT-receptor complex is unknown. We obtained M15 cells from E10.5 mesonephric mesenchyme and systematically analyzed components required for canonical WNT9b-responsiveness. When M15 cells were transfected with a β-catenin luciferase reporter plasmid, exposure to recombinant WNT9b resulted in minimal luciferase activity. We then analyzed mRNA-expression of WNT-pathway components and identified Fzd1-6 and Lrp6 transcripts but not Rspo1. When M15 cells were treated with recombinant RSPO1 the response to transfected WNT9b was augmented 4.8-fold. Co-transfection of M15 cells with Fzd5 (but no other Fzd family member) further increased the WNT9b signal to 16.8-fold and siRNA knockdown of Fzd5 reduced the signal by 52%. Knockdown of Lrp6 resulted in 60% WNT9b signal reduction. We confirmed Fzd5, Lrp6 and Rspo1 mRNA expression in CITED1(+) NPCs from E15.5 embryonic mouse kidney. Thus, while many WNT signaling-pathway components are present by E10.5, optimum responsiveness of E11.5 cap mesenchyme requires that NPCs acquire RSPO1, FZD5 and LRP6."

We analyzed the Korean Network for Organ Sharing (KONOS) database to assess the impact of waiting time on post-transplant survival outcomes and investigate risk factors for mortality by waiting time based on a complete enumeration survey in Korea.We analyzed all persons aged over 18 years in deceased donor kidney transplant cases enrolled in the Korean Network for Organ Sharing (KONOS) database from January 2000 to January 2015. The primary end point was all-cause mortality after enrollment.Of the 24,296 wait-listed subjects on dialysis, 5,255 patients received kidney transplants from deceased donors, with a median waiting time of 4.5 years. Longer waiting times had distinct deleterious effects on overall survival after transplantation. While waiting for a transplant, patients with diabetes were more likely to die before transplantation (HR 1.515, 95% CI 1.388-1.653, p<0.001). Age was another significant risk factor for mortality. Only 56% of people aged 65 years survived after 10 years of waiting, whereas 86% of people aged 35 years survived after 10 years. Moreover, women on the waiting list were more likely to live longer than men on the list.More attention should be focused on patients with a higher risk of mortality while waiting for a deceased donor kidney transplant, such as patients with diabetes, those of advanced age, and those who are male."
https://openalex.org/W2938493145,"We present a new signal for detecting deception: full body motion. Previous work on detecting deception from body movement has relied either on human judges or on specific gestures (such as fidgeting or gaze aversion) that are coded by humans. While this research has helped to build the foundation of the field, results are often characterized by inconsistent and contradictory findings, with small-stakes lies under lab conditions detected at rates little better than guessing. We examine whether a full body motion capture suit, which records the position, velocity, and orientation of 23 points in the subject's body, could yield a better signal of deception. Interviewees of South Asian (n = 60) or White British culture (n = 30) were required to either tell the truth or lie about two experienced tasks while being interviewed by somebody from their own (n = 60) or different culture (n = 30). We discovered that full body motion-the sum of joint displacements-was indicative of lying 74.4% of the time. Further analyses indicated that including individual limb data in our full body motion measurements can increase its discriminatory power to 82.2%. Furthermore, movement was guilt- and penitential-related, and occurred independently of anxiety, cognitive load, and cultural background. It appears that full body motion can be an objective nonverbal indicator of deceit, showing that lying does not cause people to freeze."
https://openalex.org/W2939046387,"Motor adaptation to perturbations is provided by learning mechanisms operating in the cerebellum and basal ganglia. The cerebellum normally performs motor adaptation through supervised learning using information about movement error provided by visual feedback. However, if visual feedback is critically distorted, the system may disengage cerebellar error-based learning and switch to reinforcement learning mechanisms mediated by basal ganglia. Yet, the exact conditions and mechanisms of cerebellum and basal ganglia involvement in motor adaptation remain unknown. We use mathematical modeling to simulate control of planar reaching movements that relies on both error-based and non-error-based learning mechanisms. We show that for learning to be efficient only one of these mechanisms should be active at a time. We suggest that switching between the mechanisms is provided by a special circuit that effectively suppresses the learning process in one structure and enables it in the other. To do so, this circuit modulates learning rate in the cerebellum and dopamine release in basal ganglia depending on error-based learning efficiency. We use the model to explain and interpret experimental data on error- and non-error-based motor adaptation under different conditions."

One fourth of participants (25.6%) had a poor level of knowledge, 50.2% a moderate, and only 24.2% a good level about the most common infectious diseases in the destination country. Those who had received information from physicians about the most common infectious diseases in the destination country and who do not need additional information were significantly more likely to have a good level of knowledge. A large majority (91%) showed no concern about the risk of getting an infectious disease during the travel. Almost half of the respondents had received information concerning the most common infectious diseases in the destination country and the related prevention measures. This information was more likely acquired by those graduated, those who know the foods that can cause the infectious diseases, and those who self-perceived a well health status, and less likely by those who had a poor level of knowledge about the most common infectious diseases in the destination country and who were going to Asia and South America.

https://openalex.org/W2951356366,"Background Human tuberculosis (TB) is caused by seven phylogenetic lineages of the Mycobacterium tuberculosis complex (MTBC), Lineage 1–7. Recent advances in rapid genotyping of MTBC based on single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNP), allow for phylogenetically robust strain classification, paving the way for defining genotype-phenotype relationships in clinical settings. Such studies have revealed that, in addition to host and environmental factors, strain variation in the MTBC influences the outcome of TB infection and disease. In Tanzania, such molecular epidemiological studies of TB however are scarce in spite of a high TB burden. Methods and findings Here we used SNP-typing to characterize a nationwide collection of 2,039 MTBC clinical isolates representative of 1.6% of all new and retreatment TB cases notified in Tanzania during 2012 and 2013. Four lineages, namely Lineage 1–4 were identified within the study population. The distribution and frequency of these lineages varied across regions but overall, Lineage 4 was the most frequent (n = 866, 42.5%), followed by Lineage 3 (n = 681, 33.4%) and 1 (n = 336, 16.5%), with Lineage 2 being the least frequent (n = 92, 4.5%). We found Lineage 2 to be independently associated with female sex (adjusted odds ratio [aOR] 2.14; 95% confidence interval [95% CI] 1.31 – 3.50, p = 0.002) and retreatment cases (aOR 1.67; 95% CI 0.95 – 2.84, p = 0. 065) in the study population. We found no associations between MTBC lineage and patient age or HIV status. Our sublineage typing based on spacer oligotyping on a subset of Lineage 1, 3 and 4 strains revealed the presence of mainly EAI, CAS and LAM families. Finally, we detected low levels of multidrug resistant isolates among a subset of 144 retreatment cases. Conclusions This study provides novel insights into the MTBC lineages and the possible influence of pathogen–related factors on the TB epidemic in Tanzania."
https://openalex.org/W2935902497,"We studied the saproxylic beetle community inhabiting deadwood in remnants of riparian cloud forests in “La Antigua” basin, in central Veracruz (Mexico). We assessed the influence of deadwood features (tree species, trunk position, trunk diameter, trunk volume and decomposition stages) on saproxylic beetle diversity. In order to assess the stability of beetle species-deadwood interactions, we also analyzed the ecological networks structure. A total of 63 deadwood trunks, belonging to four tree species, were sampled by standardized hand-collection throughout well-preserved remnants of riparian cloud forest. We found that tree species and deadwood decay stage are the main drivers that determine the diversity and stability of saproxylic beetle species interactions. Our results indicate that Quercus corrugata is the main tree species in terms of maintaining the significantly highest saproxylic beetle diversity, but with no stable interactions (saproxylic beetle-deadwood). A nested network structure was detected for Clethra mexicana and Liquidambar styraciflua, with a pool of core (generalist) saproxylic beetle species. We observed that beetle diversity from the early and late deadwood stages comprises distinct assemblages and the four stages of decomposition showed a nested network structure. During deadwood succession, community composition and guilds changed among networks; the early successional stage had more specialized xylophagous beetles, while other guilds (mycophagous, saprophagous and zoophagous) arrive later and become the core species in the advanced stages of decomposition networks. Heliscus tropicus (Passalidae) is a key species constituting the core of all of the networks and could be considered an ecosystem engineer in cloud forests. By exploring links between saproxylic beetles and deadwood characteristics, we can further our understanding of species interaction in order to develop management strategies oriented towards the protection of species and their habitats in this threatened ecosystem."

UUO was performed with a microvascular clamp. At day 3 after surgery, the ureteral clamp was removed and nephrectomy of the contralateral kidney was performed. Immediately, PBS, siRNA SC (50μg) or siRNA-CD40 (50μg) was administrated via the tail vein. Mice were killed 48h hours after the siRNA or saline administration. Wild type (WT) mice were used as controls. Blood samples were collected for measuring creatinine and blood urea nitrogen (BUN). Histology and kidney mRNA expression were performed.The administration of siRNA-CD40 reduced significantly the severity of acute renal failure associated with UUO. Pathologic analysis showed reduction of tubular dilation, interstitial fibrosis, F4/80 macrophage and CD3 (T cell) infiltration in animals treated with siRNA-CD40. Furthermore, kidney mRNA gene expression analysis showed significantly lower levels of macrophage markers (F4/80 and Mannose receptor), fibrosis matrix proteins (Fibronectin, MMP-9, Collagen IV and α-SMA), pro-inflammatory cytokines (iNOS and MCP-1) and the pro-fibrotic molecule TGF-β1 in siRNA-CD40.The administration of siRNA-CD40 therapy reduces the severity of the acute kidney injury induced by obstructive uropathy and promotes kidney repair.

The two ssDNA–RecA filaments catalyze alignment of the ssDNA with homologous sequences in dsDNA. If sufficient local homology is present, the base pairing of the complementary strand in the dsDNA is transferred from its original partner in the dsDNA to the invading ssDNA in the ssDNA–RecA filament. That transfer of base pairing is referred to as strand exchange. Strand exchange creates a heteroduplex dsDNA product in which the invading and complementary strands are base-paired (see Fig. 1A, panel iii) (1Kowalczykowski S.C.

An overview of the molecular mechanisms of recombinational DNA repair.Cold Spring Harb. Perspect. Biol. 2015; 7 (26525148)a01641010.1101/cshperspect.a016410Crossref PubMed Scopus (267) Google Scholar). The extension of the invading strand in the D-loop depends on an interaction among a DNA polymerase, the 3′ end of the invading ssDNA, and the complementary strand in the dsDNA. The required geometry between the 3′ end of the invading ssDNA and the complementary strand can be established by heteroduplex strand exchange products near the 3′ end of the invading ssDNA (Fig. 1A, panel iv). Because heteroduplex formation depends on the homology between the invading and complementary strands (5Hsieh P. Camerini-Otero C.S. Camerini-Otero R.D.

This is not surprising because RecA is an ATPase (14Schutte B.C. Cox M.M.

Thus, the probability of incorporating an N-bp region of accidental homology into a genome may be influenced by the extension of the invading strand in the D-loop that is triggered by strand exchange. Previous in vitro experiments have shown that N affects the triggering of DNA synthesis by RecA-mediated strand exchange (19Li C. Danilowicz C. Tashjian T.F. Godoy V.G. Prévost C. Prentiss M. The positioning of Chi sites allows the RecBCD pathway to suppress some genomic rearrangements.Nucleic Acids Res. 2019; 47 (30544167): 1836-184610.1093/nar/gky1252PubMed Google Scholar). The previous studies indicated that heteroduplex products rarely trigger DNA synthesis unless the number of homologous bases is N ≥ 20 (19Li C. Danilowicz C. Tashjian T.F. Godoy V.G. Prévost C. Prentiss M. The positioning of Chi sites allows the RecBCD pathway to suppress some genomic rearrangements.Nucleic Acids Res. 2019; 47 (30544167): 1836-184610.1093/nar/gky1252PubMed Google Scholar). However, that previous work did not consider how DNA synthesis that extends the invading strand in a D-loop affects the yield of heteroduplex products or how N influences the progress of invading strand extension after the extension is triggered by the formation of a heteroduplex product (19Li C. Danilowicz C. Tashjian T.F. Godoy V.G. Prévost C. Prentiss M. The positioning of Chi sites allows the RecBCD pathway to suppress some genomic rearrangements.Nucleic Acids Res. 2019; 47 (30544167): 1836-184610.1093/nar/gky1252PubMed Google Scholar). In this work, we extend that study to determine whether DNA synthesis that extends the invading strand in a D-loop affects the yield of heteroduplex products. We also probe how N influences the extension of the invading strand in the D-loop after DNA synthesis is initiated by RecA-mediated strand exchange. Many DNA polymerases can potentially perform DNA synthesis. In this work, we considered two different polymerases, Bacillus subtilis DNA polymerase, large fragment (DNA LF-Bsu Pol) and DNA polymerase (Pol) IV. DNA Pol IV is up-regulated by the SOS response that follows formation of a double-strand break among other insults (20Janion C. Inducible SOS response system of DNA repair and mutagenesis in Escherichia coli.Int. J. Biol. Sci. 2008; 4 (18825275): 338-344Crossref PubMed Scopus (199) Google Scholar), and DNA Pol IV is known to extend invading strands in D-loops formed by RecA-mediated homologous recombination (9Pomerantz R.T. Kurth I. Goodman M.F. O'Donnell M.E. Preferential D-loop extension by a translesion DNA polymerase underlies error-prone recombination.Nat. Struct. Mol. Biol. 2013; 20 (23686288): 748-75510.1038/nsmb.2573Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). Thus, we chose to consider how DNA Pol IV extends the invading strand in D-loops formed by RecA-mediated recombination in vitro. When DNA synthesis does not require strand displacement, DNA Pol IV synthesis is inefficient (21Tang M. Pham P. Shen X. Taylor J.-S. O'Donnell M. Woodgate R. Goodman M.F. Roles of E. coli DNA polymerases IV and V in lesion-targeted and untargeted SOS mutagenesis.Nature. 2000; 404 (10801133): 1014-101810.1038/35010020Crossref PubMed Scopus (392) Google Scholar), whereas synthesis by DNA LF-Bsu is rapid and processive (22Le Chatelier E. Bécherel O.J. d’Alençon E. Canceill D. Ehrlich S.D. Fuchs R.P. Jannière L. Involvement of DnaE, the second replicative DNA polymerase from Bacillus subtilis, in DNA mutagenesis.J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279 (14593098): 1757-176710.1074/jbc.M310719200Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). DNA LF-Bsu Pol is a well-characterized, commercially available protein that also provides rapid strand displacement DNA synthesis in vitro; therefore, we chose to compare invading strand extension performed by DNA Pol IV with the invading strand extension performed by DNA LF-Bsu Pol. For either polymerase, we found that extension of the invading strand in a D-loop increases the yield of heteroduplex strand exchange products. Importantly, when the extension of the invading strand is limited to ≤15 nt, the fluorescence signals for both polymerases are similar. In contrast, when the invading strand can be extended by 50 or more nt, DNA LF-Bsu Pol extends the invading strand more than DNA Pol IV. We also found that the homology dependence of the extension of the invading strand in the D-loop by DNA Pol IV is quite different from the homology dependence of the extension by DNA LF-Bsu Pol. Finally, we present a model that could explain these differences in homology dependence and consider implications of the model for genomic rearrangements. We used FRET to study both strand exchange and DNA synthesis that extends the invading strand in a D-loop formed by strand exchange. As in previous studies, a fluorescein label is placed on one of the dsDNA strands, and a rhodamine label is placed on the other strand (7Danilowicz C. Yang D. Kelley C. Prévost C. Prentiss M. The poor homology stringency in the heteroduplex allows strand exchange to incorporate desirable mismatches without sacrificing recognition in vivo.Nucleic Acids Res. 2015; 43 (26089391): 6473-648510.1093/nar/gkv610Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar, 13Danilowicz C.

Thus, initially rhodamine quenches the fluorescein label. Because the fluorophores are positioned on opposite strands in the dsDNA, the quenching becomes less efficient as the separation between the dsDNA strands increases. Fig. 1B illustrates how heteroduplex formation can increase fluorescein emission if a FRET pair is placed within the region of the dsDNA that is homologous to the invading strand (6Bazemore L.R. Folta-Stogniew E. Takahashi M. Radding C.M. RecA tests homology at both pairing and strand exchange.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci.

Thus, we monitored heteroduplex formation using FRET probes positioned within the region of the dsDNA that is homologous to the invading strand. Previous in vitro experiments studied the N-dependent stability of heteroduplex products in the absence of any DNA polymerase. If heteroduplex stability is influenced by the extension of the invading strand in a D-loop, then in vitro studies that do not include DNA polymerase may not capture the N probability of permanently incorporating regions of accidental homology into genomes. Thus, the influence of DNA polymerase could contribute to the large discrepancy between the N dependence of the in vivo (10Shen P. Huang H.V.

If extension of the invading strand in a D-loop enhances heteroduplex stability, then that extension should also enhance the yield of heteroduplex strand exchange products. Fig. 2A shows a schematic of experiments designed to test whether the extension of the invading strand in a D-loop increases the yield of heteroduplex products. It is a particular example of the general scheme illustrated in Fig. 1B. All of the experimental results were obtained using the same 180-bp dsDNA. The dsDNA interacted with 98-nt ssDNA–RecA filaments that were long enough (98 nt) to allow for complete filament formation. Because the dsDNA was always the same, we controlled N, the number of contiguous bp at the 3′ end of the invading strand, by changing the sequences of the 98-nt invading strands. The remaining bases in the invading strand were not sequence-matched to the corresponding bases in the complementary strand. In Fig. 2A, the matching sequences are indicated by the green regions in the dsDNA. The ends of the homologous regions are indicated by the green arrows. The fluorophores are 58 (rhodamine) and 57 bp (fluorescein) from the end of the dsDNA, so Dfluor ∼ 58 bp is the separation between the fluorescent labels and the end of the dsDNA. The 3′ end of the ssDNA–RecA filaments is 50 bp from the end of the dsDNA. We will refer to that separation as Dinit3′, and we define ΔL = Dfluor − Dinit3′. Fig. 2A shows that ΔL = 8 bp, so when ΔL > 0, the labels are positioned within the region of the dsDNA containing the N homologous bases (the homologous region). In these experiments, we measure the number of counts per second recorded by a fluorometer. We then calculate ΔF(t), the difference between the number of counts obtained at time t = 0 when the invading ssDNA is heterologous to the dsDNA (N = 0) and the number of counts measured at a time t. Fig. 2, B and D, show that in the absence of a DNA polymerase, the values of the ΔF(t) curves are quite small. The presence of either polymerase significantly increases the ΔF(t) signals if all dNTPs are present. Experiments that use 90-bp dsDNA also show that either polymerase increases the ΔF(t) signals if all dNTPs are present (Fig. S1). For both polymerases, when filaments are prepared in dATP, the fluorescence signal is larger than the fluorescence signal obtained when the filaments are prepared with ATP (Fig. 2, C and E). Importantly, experiments using 180-bp dsDNA indicate that in either buffer the increase in fluorescence for DNA LF-Bsu Pol is much larger than the increase in fluorescence for DNA Pol IV.

Reduction of E. multilocularis prevalence in foxes was achieved in various studies by distributing praziquantel-containing bait by hand or by aircraft in either rural or settlement areas. Here, an integrated approach is described from southern Germany (district of Starnberg). Baseline data were obtained in winter 2002/03, when the prevalence rate in the project area was 51%. Between December 2005 and December 2011, air distribution of bait in agricultural and recreational areas was combined with distribution by hand in towns and villages, in order to cover the entire fox population, with a bait density of 50 pieces / km2 (baiting area: 213 km2). In addition, a control area without anthelmintic treatment was selected. Prevalence was reduced in the baiting area to 1% by March 2007. Subsequently, from 2007 to the end of 2011, prevalence rates remained at a low level with 2.4% (2007), 2.4% (2008), 2.6% (2009), 1.2% (2010) and 0.0% (2011). In the un-baited control area the prevalence rates remained high, ranging from 19.6% to 35.1% with an average of 27.3%. During the 6 years of anthelmintic treatment, differences between baiting and control areas were highly significant (P<0.001). In the suburban and urban parts of the study area prevalence could be reduced to less than 1%, i.e. to a level below the limit of detection, which was maintained even after the measures had been discontinued. The applicability and effectiveness of anthelmintic baiting was therefore confirmed even for a heavily settled and fragmented landscape, which posed challenges for practical application of the control measures.

The mechanisms underlying these processes are unclear.Heterotopic heart transplantion (hHTX) is an accepted model for the study of mechanical unloading in rodents. The wide variety of genetically modified strains in mice provides an unique opportunity to examine remodeling pathways. However, the procedure is technically demanding and has not been extensively used in this area. To support investigators adopting this method, we present our experience establishing the abdominal hHTX in mice and describe refinements to the technique.In this model, the transplanted heart is vascularised but implanted in series, and therefore does not contribute to systemic circulation and results in a complete mechanical unloading of the donor heart. Training followed a systematic program using a combination of literature, video tutorials, cadaveric training, direct observation and training in live animals.Successful transplantation was defined as a recipient surviving > 24 hours with a palpable, beating apex in the transplanted heart and was achieved after 20 transplants in live animals. A success rate of 90% was reached after 60 transplants. Operative time was shown to decrease in correlation with increasing number of procedures from 200 minutes to 45 minutes after 60 operations. Cold/warm ischemia time improved from 45/100 to 10/20 minutes. Key factors for success and trouble shootings were identified.Abdominal hHTX in the mouse may enable future examination of specific pathways in unloading induced myocardial remodeling. Establishment of the technique, however, is challenging. Structured training programs utilising a variety of training methods can help to expedite the process. Postoperative management, including daily scoring increases animal wellbeing and helps to predict survival."
https://openalex.org/W2939499151,"The Estonian Biobank, governed by the Institute of Genomics at the University of Tartu (Biobank), has stored genetic material/DNA and continuously collected data since 2002 on a total of 52,274 individuals representing ~5% of the Estonian adult population and is increasing. To explore the utility of data available in the Biobank, we conducted a phenome-wide association study (PheWAS) in two areas of interest to healthcare researchers; asthma and liver disease. We used 11 asthma and 13 liver disease-associated single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs), identified from published genome-wide association studies, to test our ability to detect established associations. We confirmed 2 asthma and 5 liver disease associated variants at nominal significance and directionally consistent with published results. We found 2 associations that were opposite to what was published before (rs4374383:AA increases risk of NASH/NAFLD, rs11597086 increases ALT level). Three SNP-diagnosis pairs passed the phenome-wide significance threshold: rs9273349 and E06 (thyroiditis, p = 5.50x10-8); rs9273349 and E10 (type-1 diabetes, p = 2.60x10-7); and rs2281135 and K76 (non-alcoholic liver diseases, including NAFLD, p = 4.10x10-7). We have validated our approach and confirmed the quality of the data for these conditions. Importantly, we demonstrate that the extensive amount of genetic and medical information from the Estonian Biobank can be successfully utilized for scientific research."
https://openalex.org/W2937983819,"Effective delivery of protein therapeutics into the brain remains challenging because of difficulties associated with crossing the blood-brain barrier (BBB). To overcome this problem, many researchers have focused on antibodies binding the transferrin receptor (TfR), which is expressed in endothelial cells, including those of the BBB, and is involved in receptor-mediated transcytosis (RMT). RMT and anti-TfR antibodies provide a useful means of delivering therapeutics into the brain, but the anti-TfR antibody has a short half-life in blood because of its broad expression throughout the body. As a result, anti-TfR antibodies are only maintained at high concentrations in the brain for a short time. To overcome this problem, we developed a different approach which slows down the export of therapeutic antibodies from the brain by binding them to a brain-specific antigen. Here we report a new technology, named AccumuBrain, that achieves both high antibody concentration in the brain and a long half-life in blood by binding to myelin oligodendrocyte glycoprotein (MOG), which is specifically expressed in oligodendrocytes. We report that, using our technology, anti-MOG antibody levels in the brains of mice (Mus musculus) and rats (Rattus norvegicus) were increased several tens of times for a period of one month. The mechanism of this technology is different from that of RMT technologies like TfR and would constitute a breakthrough for central nervous system disease therapeutics."
https://openalex.org/W2938921214,"A mild ischemic load applied after a lethal ischemic insult reduces the subsequent ischemia-reperfusion injury, and is called ischemic postconditioning (PostC). We studied the effect of ischemic PostC on synaptic glutamate release using a whole-cell patch-clamp technique. We recorded spontaneous excitatory post-synaptic currents (sEPSCs) from CA1 pyramidal cells in mouse hippocampal slices. The ischemic load was perfusion of artificial cerebrospinal fluid (ACSF) equilibrated with mixed gas (95% N2 and 5% CO2). The ischemic load was applied for 7.5 min, followed by ischemic PostC 30 s later, consisting of three cycles of 15 s of reperfusion and 15 s of re-ischemia. We found that a surging increase in sEPSCs frequency occurred during the immediate-early reperfusion period after the ischemic insult. We found a significant positive correlation between cumulative sEPSCs and the number of dead CA1 neurons (r = 0.70; p = 0.02). Ischemic PostC significantly suppressed this surge of sEPSCs. The mitochondrial KATP (mito-KATP) channel opener, diazoxide, also suppressed the surge of sEPSCs when applied for 15 min immediately after the ischemic load. The mito-KATP channel blocker, 5-hydroxydecanoate (5-HD), significantly attenuated the suppressive effect of both ischemic PostC and diazoxide application on the surge of sEPSCs. These results suggest that the opening of mito-KATP channels is involved in the suppressive effect of ischemic PostC on synaptic glutamate release and protection against neuronal death. We hypothesize that activation of mito-KATP channels prevents mitochondrial malfunction and breaks mutual facilitatory coupling between glutamate release and Ca2+ entry at presynaptic sites."
https://openalex.org/W2896629548,"Understanding the biological mechanisms behind aging, lifespan and healthspan is becoming increasingly important as the proportion of the world's population over the age of 65 grows, along with the cost and complexity of their care. BigData oriented approaches and analysis methods enable current and future bio-gerontologists to synthesize, distill and interpret vast, heterogeneous data from functional genomics studies of aging. GeneWeaver is an analysis system for integration of data that allows investigators to store, search, and analyze immense amounts of data including user-submitted experimental data, data from primary publications, and data in other databases. Aging related genome-wide gene sets from primary publications were curated into this system in concert with data from other model-organism and aging-specific databases, and applied to several questions in genrontology using. For example, we identified Cd63 as a frequently represented gene among aging-related genome-wide results. To evaluate the role of Cd63 in aging, we performed RNAi knockdown of the C. elegans ortholog, tsp-7, demonstrating that this manipulation is capable of extending lifespan. The tools in GeneWeaver enable aging researchers to make new discoveries into the associations between the genes, normal biological processes, and diseases that affect aging, healthspan, and lifespan."
https://openalex.org/W2938441518,"Longevity in the United States ranks below most other Western nations despite spending more on healthcare per capita than any other country. Across the world, mortality has been declining, but in the USA the trend toward improvement has stalled in some middle-aged demographic groups. Cross-national studies suggest that social welfare is positively associated with longevity. The United States has less government sponsored welfare, education and healthcare than almost all other Western nations, but the level of this social welfare commitment varies across the states. In this study we examined the association of state tax burden and state government expenditures with subsequent middle-aged mortality.The primary exposure was state tax burden in 2005, defined as proportion of all state income paid to the state. We also examined the impact of state expenditures per capita in 2005 for education, healthcare, welfare, police and highways. The dependent variable was mortality during the subsequent 10 years. Death counts and population sizes by sex, age group and race strata for 2006-2015 were abstracted from CDC WONDER. Binomial logistic regression was employed based on the number of deaths and underlying population within each county-sex-age-race bin.State tax burden in 2005 varied from 5.8% to 12.2%. An increase of 1.0 percentage point in state tax burden was associated with a 5.8% (SE = 0.1%) reduction in mortality adjusted for sex, age and race, but was associated with a 1.1% (SE = 0.1%) reduction when further adjusting for state income and education levels. Controlling for sex, age and race each type of state expenditures was associated with decreases in middle aged mortality, notably K-12 education (reduction of 4.7%, SE = 0.1%, per 10% expenditure increase) except healthcare but all types were associated with mortality decreases further controlling for state income and education.The residents of states with higher state taxation and higher expenditures per capita have lower middle aged mortality rates."
https://openalex.org/W2939351829,"The Gram-negative bacterium Kerstersia gyiorum, a potential etiological agent of clinical infections, was isolated from several human patients presenting clinical symptoms. Its significance as a possible pathogen has been previously overlooked as no disease has thus far been definitively associated with this bacterium. To better understand how the organism contributes to the infectious disease, we determined the complete genomic sequence of K. gyiorum SWMUKG01, the first clinical isolate from southwest China.The genomic data obtained displayed a single circular chromosome of 3, 945, 801 base pairs in length, which contains 3, 441 protein-coding genes, 55 tRNA genes and 9 rRNA genes. Analysis on the full spectrum of protein coding genes for cellular structures, two-component regulatory systems and iron uptake pathways that may be important for the success of the bacterial survival, colonization and establishment in the host conferred new insights into the virulence characteristics of K. gyiorum. Phylogenomic comparisons with Alcaligenaceae species indicated that K. gyiorum SWMUKG01 had a close evolutionary relationships with Alcaligenes aquatilis and Alcaligenes faecalis.The comprehensive analysis presented in this work determinates for the first time a complete genome sequence of K. gyiorum, which is expected to provide useful information for subsequent studies on pathogenesis of this species."

Our methods are motivated by recent attempts to assess how the quality and homogeneity of large datasets may change over time by using the First-Digit Rule. We resort to a smooth multinomial logistic model which captures the dynamics governing the proportion of first digits, and apply the proposed model to global tropical cyclone tracks over the past two centuries. Our findings indicate that cumulative technological improvements may have only had a moderate influence on the homogeneity of the dataset, and hint that recent heterogeneity could be due to other drivers."
https://openalex.org/W2938616695,"Type 1 diabetic Akita mice develop severe cardiac parasympathetic dysfunction that we have previously demonstrated is due at least in part to an abnormality in the response of the end organ to parasympathetic stimulation. Specifically, we had shown that hypoinsulinemia in the diabetic heart results in attenuation of the G-protein coupled inward rectifying K channel (GIRK) which mediates the negative chronotropic response to parasympathetic stimulation due at least in part to decreased expression of the GIRK1 and GIRK4 subunits of the channel. We further demonstrated that the expression of GIRK1 and GIRK4 is under the control of the Sterol Regulatory element Binding Protein (SREBP-1), which is also decreased in response to hypoinsulinemia. Finally, given that hyperactivity of Glycogen Synthase Kinase (GSK)3β, had been demonstrated in the diabetic heart, we demonstrated that treatment of Akita mice with Li+, an inhibitor of GSK3β, increased parasympathetic responsiveness and SREBP-1 levels consistent with the conclusion that GSK3β might regulate IKACh via an effect on SREBP-1. However, inhibitor studies were complicated by lack of specificity for GSK3β. Here we generated an Akita mouse with cardiac specific inducible knockout of GSK3β. Using this mouse, we demonstrate that attenuation of GSK3β expression is associated with an increase in parasympathetic responsiveness measured as an increase in the heart rate response to atropine from 17.3 ± 3.5% (n = 8) prior to 41.2 ± 5.4% (n = 8, P = 0.017), an increase in the duration of carbamylcholine mediated bradycardia from 8.43 ± 1.60 min (n = 7) to 12.71 ± 2.26 min (n = 7, P = 0.028) and an increase in HRV as measured by an increase in the high frequency fraction from 40.78 ± 3.86% to 65.04 ± 5.64 (n = 10, P = 0.005). Furthermore, patch clamp measurements demonstrated a 3-fold increase in acetylcholine stimulated peak IKACh in atrial myocytes from GSK3β deficiency mice compared with control. Finally, western blot analysis of atrial extracts from knockout mice demonstrated increased levels of SREBP-1, GIRK1 and GIRK4 compared with control. Taken together with our prior observations, these data establish a role of increased GSK3β activity in the pathogenesis of parasympathetic dysfunction in type 1 diabetes via the regulation of IKACh and GIRK1/4 expression."
https://openalex.org/W2938954430,"Atomic interactions in solid materials are described using network theory. The tools of network theory focus on understanding the properties of a system based upon the underlying interactions which govern their dynamics. While the full atomistic network is dense, we apply a spectral sparsification technique to construct a sparse interaction network model that reduces the computational complexity while preserving macroscopic conservation properties. This sparse network is compared to a reduced network created using a cut-off radius (threshold method) that is commonly used to speed-up computations while approximating interatomic forces. The approximations used to estimate the total forces on each atom are quantified to assess how local interatomic force errors propagate errors at the global or continuum scale by comparing spectral sparsification to thresholding. In particular, we quantify the performance of the spectral sparsification algorithm for the short-range Lennard-Jones potential and the long-range Coulomb potential. Spectral sparsification of the Lennard-Jones potential yields comparable results to thresholding while spectral sparsification yields improvements when considering a long-range Coulomb potential. The present network-theoretic formulation is implemented on two sample problems: relaxation of atoms near a surface and a tensile test of a solid with a circular hole."
https://openalex.org/W2952987137,"Bovine Salivary Protein 30b (BSP30b) is a member of the tubular lipid-binding (TULIP) superfamily that includes the human bactericidal/permeability-increasing proteins (BPI), lipopolysaccharide binding proteins (LBP) and palate, lung, and nasal epithelium carcinoma-associated proteins (PLUNC). BSP30b is most closely related to the PLUNC family and is predominantly found in bovine saliva. There are four BSP30 isoforms (BSP30a-d) and collectively, they are the most abundant protein component of bovine saliva. The PLUNC family members are proposed to be lipid binding proteins, although in most cases their lipid ligands are unknown. Here, we present the X-ray crystal structure of BSP30b at 2.0 Å resolution. We used a double methionine mutant and Se-Met SAD phasing to solve the structure. The structure adopts a curved cylindrical form with a hydrophobic channel formed by an α/β wrap, which is consistent with the TULIP superfamily. The structure of BSP30b in complex with oleic acid is also presented where the ligand is accommodated within the hydrophobic channel. The electron density for oleic acid suggests that the ligand is only partially occupied in the binding site implying that oleic acid may not be the preferred ligand. GFP-tagged BSP30b binds to the surface of olive oil droplets, as observed under fluorescent microscopy, and acts as a surfactant consistent with its association with decreased susceptibility to bloat in cattle. Bacteria extracted directly from bovine rumen contents indicate that the GFP_BSP30b fusion protein binds to a small number of selected bacterial species in vivo. These results suggest that BSP30b may bind to bacterial lipids from specific species and that this abundant protein may have important biological roles via interacting with rumen bacteria during feeding and rumination."
https://openalex.org/W2935799600,"Protein dynamics is pivotal to biological processes. However, experiments are very demanding and difficult to perform, and all-atom molecular dynamics simulations can still not provide all the answers. This motivates us to analyze protein dynamics in terms of different reduced coordinate representations. We then need to resolve how to reconstruct the full all-atom dynamics from its coarse grained approximation. Accordingly we scrutinize all-atom molecular dynamics trajectories in terms of crystallographic Protein Data Bank (PDB) structures, and inquire to what extent is it possible to predict the dynamics of side chain Cβ atoms in terms of the static properties of backbone Cα and O atoms. Here we find that simulated Cβ dynamics at near physiological conditions can be reconstructed with very high precision, using the knowledge of the crystallographic backbone Cα and O positions. The precision we can reach with our PDB-based Statistical Method reconstruction exceeds that of popular all-atom reconstruction methods such as Remo and Pulchra, and is fully comparable with the precision of the highly elaborate Scwrl4 all-atom reconstruction method that we have enhanced with the knowledge of the backbone Cα and O atom positions. We then conclude that in a dynamical protein that moves around at physiological conditions, the relative positions of its Cβ atoms with respect to the backbone Cα and O atoms, deviate very little from their relative positions in static crystallographic PDB structures. This proposes that the dynamics of a biologically active protein could remain subject to very similar, stringent stereochemical constraints that dictate the structure of a folded crystallographic protein. Thus, our results provide a strong impetus to the development of coarse grained techniques that are based on reduced coordinate representations."

It was for a job I had worked toward for years, as a medical doctor doing research and teaching along with treating patients—a rare and highly competitive type of post in the United Kingdom. Toward the end of the interview, I was asked how I would balance the different parts of the role. I had expected this question and had thought about how I would answer. Still, I hesitated. I could say what I thought the members of the interview panel wanted to hear: I'm good at multitasking, prioritizing, and delegating, and I was confident that I would be able to juggle the various responsibilities. That would have been true—yet it didn't feel authentic. The more honest answer was that I knew it would be difficult, but I wanted to try anyway. I wasn't sure which answer to give."
https://openalex.org/W2936837802,"In this paper, we consider joint decisions on inventory rationing and replenishment from a regular supplier or a backup supplier with two classes of customers. When the on-hand inventory falls below a certain critical level, an inventory rationing policy is implemented to reject lower priority customers. We investigated the potential use of a backup supplier as a response to inventory rationing policy. First, we establish an inventory level transition equilibrium equation for the steady-state inventory level probability distributions and derive analytical steady-state performance indicators. Next, the inventory cost function and the nonlinear optimization model are characterized. We use real-coded genetic algorithm (RCGA) to search for the optimal joint decisions. Finally, the proposed algorithm and the joint decisions are investigated with different inventory service polices through numerical experiments. The results show that the inventory rationing policy (IRP) is superior to the traditional priority service policy (CPSP) and the common first-come-first service policy (FCFSP). The backup supply can reduce inventory costs with high arrival intensity."
