https://openalex.org/W2021260035,"Amyloid β-peptide (Aβ), the pathogenic agent of Alzheimer disease, is a physiological metabolite whose levels are constantly controlled in normal brain. Recent studies have demonstrated that a fraction of extracellular Aβ is associated with exosomes, small membrane vesicles of endosomal origin, although the fate of Aβ in association with exosome is largely unknown. In this study, we identified novel roles for neuron-derived exosomes acting on extracellular Aβ, i.e. exosomes drive conformational changes in Aβ to form nontoxic amyloid fibrils and promote uptake of Aβ by microglia. The Aβ internalized together with exosomes was further transported to lysosomes and degraded. We also found that blockade of phosphatidylserine on the surface of exosomes by annexin V not only prevented exosome uptake but also suppressed Aβ incorporation into microglia. In addition, we demonstrated that secretion of neuron-derived exosomes was modulated by the activities of sphingolipid-metabolizing enzymes, including neutral sphingomyelinase 2 (nSMase2) and sphingomyelin synthase 2 (SMS2). In transwell experiments, up-regulation of exosome secretion from neuronal cells by treatment with SMS2 siRNA enhanced Aβ uptake into microglial cells and significantly decreased extracellular levels of Aβ. Our findings indicate a novel mechanism responsible for clearance of Aβ through its association with exosomes. The modulation of the vesicle release and/or elimination may alter the risk of AD."
https://openalex.org/W2135955660,"Chemokine (C-C motif) receptor 2 (CCR2)-signaling can mediate accumulation of microglia at sites affected by neuroinflammation. CCR2 and its main ligand CCL2 (MCP-1) might also be involved in the altered metabolism of beta-amyloid (Aβ) underlying Alzheimer's disease (AD). We therefore measured the levels of CCL2 and three other CCR2 ligands, i.e. CCL11 (eotaxin), CCL13 (MCP-4) and CCL26 (eotaxin-3), in the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) and plasma of 30 controls and 119 patients with mild cognitive impairment (MCI) at baseline. During clinical follow-up 52 MCI patients were clinically stable for five years, 47 developed AD (i.e. cases with prodromal AD at baseline) and 20 developed other dementias. Only CSF CCL26 was statistically significantly elevated in patients with prodromal AD when compared to controls (p = 0.002). However, in patients with prodromal AD, the CCL2 levels in CSF at baseline correlated with a faster cognitive decline during follow-up (rs = 0.42, p = 0.004). Furthermore, prodromal AD patients in the highest tertile of CSF CCL2 exhibited a significantly faster cognitive decline (p<0.001) and developed AD dementia within a shorter time period (p<0.003) compared to those in the lowest tertile. Finally, in the entire MCI cohort, CSF CCL2 could be combined with CSF Tau, P-tau and Aβ42 to predict both future conversion to AD and the rate of cognitive decline. If these results are corroborated in future studies, CCL2 in CSF could be a candidate biomarker for prediction of future disease progression rate in prodromal AD. Moreover, CCR2-related signaling pathways might be new therapeutic targets for therapies aiming at slowing down the disease progression rate of AD."

Histone deacetylase (HDAC) inhibitors have been reported to have antitumor activity in different malignancies and immunomodulatory effects. Herein, we report the Tregs-targeting and immune-promoting effect of a class I specific HDAC inhibitor, entinostat, in combination with either IL-2 in a murine renal cell carcinoma (RENCA) model or a survivin-based vaccine therapy (SurVaxM) in a castration resistant prostate cancer (CR Myc-CaP) model.RENCA or CR Myc-CaP tumors were implanted orthotopically or subcutaneously, respectively. Inoculated mice were randomized into four treatment groups: vehicle, entinostat, cytokine or vaccine, and combination. Tregs in the blood were assessed by FACS analysis. Real time quantitative PCR and Western blot analysis of isolated T cell subpopulations from spleen were performed to determine Foxp3 gene and protein expression. The suppressive function of Tregs was tested by T cell proliferation assay. Low dose (5 mg/kg) entinostat reduced Foxp3 levels in Tregs and this was associated with enhanced tumor growth inhibition in combination with either IL-2 or a SurVaxM vaccine. Entinostat down-regulated Foxp3 expression transcriptionally and blocked Tregs suppressive function without affecting T effector cells (Teffs). In vitro low dose entinostat (0.5 µM) induced STAT3 acetylation and a specific inhibitor of STAT3 partially rescued entinostat-induced down-regulation of Foxp3, suggesting that STAT3 signaling is involved in Foxp3 down-regulation by entinostat.These results demonstrate a novel immunomodulatory effect of class I HDAC inhibition and provide a rationale for the clinical testing of entinostat to enhance cancer immunotherapy."
https://openalex.org/W1998602493,"Heat or Acid? The question of how tropical coral reefs will respond to increasing atmospheric greenhouse gas concentrations and concomitant climate change is widely debated. Model predictions and laboratory experiments suggest that decreasing carbonate saturation and decreasing pH may reduce calcification in carbonate-depositing organisms, including corals, yet field data are sparse, and recent declines in coral growth rates have been variously attributed to thermal stress or ocean acidification. Cooper et al. (p. 593 ) demonstrate that there has been no large-scale decline in calcification rates of massive Porites on coral reefs along the Indian Ocean coast of Western Australia. Instead, coral growth has increased significantly in the past 110 years, particularly at high latitudes. Thus, coral calcification appears to increase as ocean waters warm, but—at excessive temperatures—coral bleaching and reduced ocean carbonate saturation may lead to growth declines as observed on the Great Barrier Reef."
https://openalex.org/W2070267953,"A nearly complete genome sequence of Candidatus ‘Acetothermum autotrophicum’, a presently uncultivated bacterium in candidate division OP1, was revealed by metagenomic analysis of a subsurface thermophilic microbial mat community. Phylogenetic analysis based on the concatenated sequences of proteins common among 367 prokaryotes suggests that Ca. ‘A. autotrophicum’ is one of the earliest diverging bacterial lineages. It possesses a folate-dependent Wood-Ljungdahl (acetyl-CoA) pathway of CO2 fixation, is predicted to have an acetogenic lifestyle, and possesses the newly discovered archaeal-autotrophic type of bifunctional fructose 1,6-bisphosphate aldolase/phosphatase. A phylogenetic analysis of the core gene cluster of the acethyl-CoA pathway, shared by acetogens, methanogens, some sulfur- and iron-reducers and dechlorinators, supports the hypothesis that the core gene cluster of Ca. ‘A. autotrophicum’ is a particularly ancient bacterial pathway. The habitat, physiology and phylogenetic position of Ca. ‘A. autotrophicum’ support the view that the first bacterial and archaeal lineages were H2-dependent acetogens and methanogenes living in hydrothermal environments."
https://openalex.org/W1987993132,"In this paper we introduce the olog, or ontology log, a category-theoretic model for knowledge representation (KR). Grounded in formal mathematics, ologs can be rigorously formulated and cross-compared in ways that other KR models (such as semantic networks) cannot. An olog is similar to a relational database schema; in fact an olog can serve as a data repository if desired. Unlike database schemas, which are generally difficult to create or modify, ologs are designed to be user-friendly enough that authoring or reconfiguring an olog is a matter of course rather than a difficult chore. It is hoped that learning to author ologs is much simpler than learning a database definition language, despite their similarity. We describe ologs carefully and illustrate with many examples. As an application we show that any primitive recursive function can be described by an olog. We also show that ologs can be aligned or connected together into a larger network using functors. The various methods of information flow and institutions can then be used to integrate local and global world-views. We finish by providing several different avenues for future research."

Here, we report the crystal structures of non-glycosylated LeIBP and glycosylated LeIBP at 1.57- and 2.43-Å resolution, respectively. Structural analysis of the LeIBPs revealed a dimeric right-handed β-helix fold, which is composed of three parts: a large coiled structural domain, a long helix region (residues 96–115 form a long α-helix that packs along one face of the β-helix), and a C-terminal hydrophobic loop region (243PFVPAPEVV251). Unexpectedly, the C-terminal hydrophobic loop region has an extended conformation pointing away from the body of the coiled structural domain and forms intertwined dimer interactions. In addition, structural analysis of glycosylated LeIBP with sugar moieties attached to Asn185 provides a basis for interpreting previous biochemical analyses as well as the increased stability and secretion of glycosylated LeIBP. We also determined that the aligned Thr/Ser/Ala residues are critical for ice binding within the B face of LeIBP using site-directed mutagenesis. Although LeIBP has a common β-helical fold similar to that of canonical hyperactive antifreeze proteins, the ice-binding site is more complex and does not have a simple ice-binding motif. In conclusion, we could identify the ice-binding site of LeIBP and discuss differences in the ice-binding modes compared with other known antifreeze proteins and ice-binding proteins.

The structures of insect and bacterial AFPs exhibit a β-helical fold, and these proteins have a regular pattern of Thr residues. Two Thr residues are aligned in insect AFPs (Thr-X-Thr motif), which may allow the protein to bind to two different basal and prism planes of ice. By contrast, bacterial MpAFP (from Marinomonas primoryensis) uses a Thr-X-Asx motif located in a flat β-sheet to bind ice. Mutational studies have shown that substitution of this Thr residue with Tyr resulted in a loss of antifreeze activity (27Doucet D. Tyshenko M.G. Kuiper M.J. Graether S.P. Sykes B.D. Daugulis A.J.

LeIBP shows a remarkable sequence similarity with IBPs from other fungi, diatoms, or yeast. Comparison of the amino acid sequence of LeIBP to those of other IBPs revealed that LeIBP has 56 and 58% identity to IBPs found in the snow mold Typhula ishikariensis (TisIBP) and in the polar diatom Navicula glaciei (NglIBP), respectively. Periodic acid-Schiff (PAS) staining and peptide:N-glycosidase F treatment further confirmed the glycosylation of secreted LeIBP. Secondary structure prediction and circular dichroism experiments have revealed that IBPs are mainly composed of β-sheet elements similar to other hyperactive β-helical AFPs. However, LeIBP does not contain a simple ice-binding motif as in other hyperactive β-helical AFPs. Moreover, we have shown that LeIBP exhibits distinct differences from other AFPs, including its oligomerization, antifreeze activity, and ice-binding ability (8Lee J.K. Park K.S. Park S. Park H.

In this study, we describe two crystal structures of non-glycosylated LeIBP produced from E. coli and glycosylated LeIBP produced from Pichia pastoris. This study presents the first structure of a glycosylated IBP. We compared these structures with other known structures to understand their unusual ice-binding site as well as the role of glycosylation. We present a new class of IBPs with a unique set of ice-binding residues that form a previously undescribed dimer. Non-glycosylated LeIBP was expressed in Escherichia coli, purified, and crystallized as described previously (9Park A.K. Park K.S. Kim H.J. Park H. Ahn I.Y. Chi Y.M. Moon J.H.

Selenomethionine (SeMet)-labeled LeIBP (Leu86 and Leu172 were mutated to methionine because the amino acid sequence of LeIBP contains no methionines) was expressed in E. coli B834 cells grown in a minimal medium (M9) supplemented with SeMet and other nutrients and was purified using the same procedure used for the wild-type protein. Briefly, the transformed bacteria were grown at 30 °C in Luria-Bertani (LB) medium containing 50 mg/liter of ampicillin. Bacterial cultures were induced at A600 = 0.6 by adding isopropyl 1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside to 1 mm and incubating at 16 °C for 18 h. After lysis using sonication, the lysate was clarified by centrifugation (12,000 × g for 1 h at 4 °C) and loaded onto a nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid-agarose column pre-equilibrated with lysis buffer (20 mm potassium Pi, pH 7.4, 500 mm NaCl, and 5 mm imidazole). The protein was eluted with a 500 mm imidazole gradient. The fractions containing SeMet-labeled LeIBP protein were pooled and dialyzed against lysis buffer. After cleavage of the His6 tag at 4 °C overnight, the proteins were gel-filtrated on a Superdex 200 column (Amersham Biosciences) equilibrated in a buffer containing 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, and 150 mm NaCl. The fractions containing SeMet-labeled LeIBP protein were pooled and concentrated up to 18.2 mg/ml. The SeMet-labeled crystals were grown using hanging drop vapor diffusion at 20 °C. The drops consisted of 1 μl of protein solution (18.2 mg/ml in 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, and 150 mm NaCl) and 1 μl of reservoir solution (0.1 m sodium acetate, pH 4.5, 1.2 m ammonium sulfate, and 0.2 m NaCl). Cryoprotection was achieved by successive transfer of the crystals into mother liquor supplemented with 10, 15, 20, and 30% glycerol. Glycosylated LeIBP was expressed in P. pastoris and purified as described previously.4 Briefly, P. pastoris transformant cells were grown in 3 liters of YPD medium (1% yeast extract, 1% Bacto-tryptone, and 2% glucose) at 30 °C for 5 days. The culture was supplemented daily with 5 ml of methanol. The culture supernatant was applied to an ion exchange (QFF) column and eluted with a buffer containing 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, and 400 mm NaCl. The elution fractions were analyzed by SDS-PAGE and further separated with a Superdex 200 size exclusion column (Amersham Biosciences) equilibrated with a buffer containing 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, and 150 mm NaCl at a flow rate of 1 ml/min. The protein was concentrated to ∼25 mg/ml prior to the crystallization experiments using a Vivaspin membrane with a molecular mass cutoff of 10 kDa. The protein concentration was determined by measuring the absorbance at 280 nm using a calculated extinction coefficient of 26,930 m−1 cm−1. The best crystal used for data collection was grown using the hanging drop vapor diffusion method after mixing with a precipitant solution consisting of 0.1 m imidazole, pH 8.5, 1.7 m potassium phosphate, 0.5 m sodium phosphate, and 0.2 m NaCl using drop ratios of 1 μl of protein to 1 μl of precipitant. Large single crystals grew to a maximum size of 0.5 mm in all directions within 2–3 days. A selenium single-wavelength anomalous dispersion data set was collected to 1.57-Å resolution at the Photon Factory NE3A beam line, and diffraction images were processed and scaled with iMOSFLM (30Leslie A.G.

Mutations were introduced by site-directed PCR mutagenesis using mutagenic primers. Plasmids for non-glycosylated LeIBP were used as template DNA for mutagenesis. After amplification, the PCR fragments were digested by the DpnI restriction enzyme to eliminate template plasmids. The nucleotide sequences of the desired mutants were confirmed by DNA sequencing.

Antifreeze (thermal hysteresis) activity was measured using a nanoliter osmometer (Otago Osmometers, Dunedin, New Zealand) connected to a cold well stage mounted on a light microscope and equipped with a Canon digital camera. The sample well was placed on the stage and frozen rapidly by placing the samples on the surface of a cold metal block at approximately −20 °C. The temperature was raised slowly until a single ice crystal remained. The temperature was lowered again slowly, whereas the ice crystal morphology was maintained. The freezing point of the sample was determined to be the temperature at which rapid growth of the ice crystal was observed under the microscope. The maximum difference between the annealing temperature and freezing point during the slow cooling steps was used as an approximation of the freezing point depression activity of the sample. Measurements for the TH activity curve were done in distilled water, and the protein sample concentration ranged from 0 to 500 μm as determined by amino acid analysis.

https://openalex.org/W2041843068,"Background Inflammatory cytokines are detected in the plasma of patients with renal cell carcinoma (RCC) and are associated with poor prognosis. However, the primary cell type involved in producing inflammatory cytokines and the biological significance in RCC remain unknown. Inflammation is associated with oxidative stress, upregulation of hypoxia inducible factor 1-alpha, and production of pro-inflammatory gene products. Solid tumors are often heterogeneous in oxygen tension together suggesting that hypoxia may play a role in inflammatory processes in RCC. Epithelial cells have been implicated in cytokine release, although the stimuli to release and molecular mechanisms by which they are released remain unclear. AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) is a highly conserved sensor of cellular energy status and a role for AMPK in the regulation of cell inflammatory processes has recently been demonstrated. Methods and Principal Findings We have identified for the first time that interleukin-6 and interleukin-8 (IL-6 and IL-8) are secreted solely from RCC cells exposed to hypoxia. Furthermore, we demonstrate that the NADPH oxidase isoform, Nox4, play a key role in hypoxia-induced IL-6 and IL-8 production in RCC. Finally, we have characterized that enhanced levels of IL-6 and IL-8 result in RCC cell invasion and that activation of AMPK reduces Nox4 expression, IL-6 and IL-8 production, and RCC cell invasion. Conclusions/Significance Together, our data identify novel mechanisms by which AMPK and Nox4 may be linked to inflammation-induced RCC metastasis and that pharmacological activation of AMPK and/or antioxidants targeting Nox4 may represent a relevant therapeutic intervention to reduce IL-6- and IL-8-induced inflammation and cell invasion in RCC."
https://openalex.org/W1634644123,"We have studied for the first time the transcriptional regulatory circuit that controls the expression of the box genes encoding the aerobic hybrid pathway used to assimilate benzoate via coenzyme A (CoA) derivatives in bacteria. The promoters responsible for the expression of the box cluster in the β-proteobacterium Azoarcus sp., their cognate transcriptional repressor, the BoxR protein, and the inducer molecule (benzoyl-CoA) have been characterized. The BoxR protein shows a significant sequence identity to the BzdR transcriptional repressor that controls the bzd genes involved in the anaerobic degradation of benzoate. Because the boxR gene is present in all box clusters so far identified in bacteria, the BoxR/benzoyl-CoA regulatory system appears to be a widespread strategy to control this aerobic hybrid pathway. Interestingly, the paralogous BoxR and BzdR regulators act synergistically to control the expression of the box and bzd genes. This cross-regulation between anaerobic and aerobic pathways for the catabolism of aromatic compounds has never been shown before, and it may reflect a biological strategy to increase the cell fitness in organisms that survive in environments subject to changing oxygen concentrations."
https://openalex.org/W2081331206,"Cells of eukaryotic or prokaryotic origin express proteins with LysM domains that associate with the cell wall envelope of bacteria. The molecular properties that enable LysM domains to interact with microbial cell walls are not yet established. Staphylococcus aureus, a spherical microbe, secretes two murein hydrolases with LysM domains, Sle1 and LytN. We show here that the LysM domains of Sle1 and LytN direct murein hydrolases to the staphylococcal envelope in the vicinity of the cross-wall, the mid-cell compartment for peptidoglycan synthesis. LysM domains associate with the repeating disaccharide β-N-acetylmuramic acid, (1→4)-β-N-acetylglucosamine of staphylococcal peptidoglycan. Modification of N-acetylmuramic acid with wall teichoic acid, a ribitol-phosphate polymer tethered to murein linkage units, prevents the LysM domain from binding to peptidoglycan. The localization of LytN and Sle1 to the cross-wall is abolished in staphylococcal tagO mutants, which are defective for wall teichoic acid synthesis. We propose a model whereby the LysM domain ensures septal localization of LytN and Sle1 followed by processive cleavage of peptidoglycan, thereby exposing new LysM binding sites in the cross-wall and separating bacterial cells."
https://openalex.org/W2084758459,"Bacterial lipoproteins/lipopeptides inducing host innate immune responses are sensed by mammalian Toll-like receptor 2 (TLR2). These bacterial lipoproteins are structurally divided into two groups, diacylated or triacylated lipoproteins, by the absence or presence of an amide-linked fatty acid. The presence of diacylated lipoproteins has been predicted in low-GC content gram-positive bacteria and mycoplasmas based on the absence of one modification enzyme in their genomes; however, we recently determined triacylated structures in low-GC gram-positive Staphylococcus aureus, raising questions about the actual lipoprotein structure in other low-GC content gram-positive bacteria. Here, through intensive MS analyses, we identified a novel and unique bacterial lipoprotein structure containing an N-acyl-S-monoacyl-glyceryl-cysteine (named the lyso structure) from low-GC gram-positive Enterococcus faecalis, Bacillus cereus, Streptococcus sanguinis, and Lactobacillus bulgaricus. Two of the purified native lyso-form lipoproteins induced proinflammatory cytokine production from mice macrophages in a TLR2-dependent and TLR1-independent manner but with a different dependence on TLR6. Additionally, two other new lipoprotein structures were identified. One is the ""N-acetyl"" lipoprotein structure containing N-acetyl-S-diacyl-glyceryl-cysteine, which was found in five gram-positive bacteria, including Bacillus subtilis. The N-acetyl lipoproteins induced the proinflammatory cytokines through the TLR2/6 heterodimer. The other was identified in a mycoplasma strain and is an unusual diacyl lipoprotein structure containing two amino acids before the lipid-modified cysteine residue. Taken together, our results suggest the existence of novel TLR2-stimulating lyso and N-acetyl forms of lipoproteins that are conserved in low-GC content gram-positive bacteria and provide clear evidence for the presence of yet to be identified key enzymes involved in the bacterial lipoprotein biosynthesis."
https://openalex.org/W1981366282,"MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are a class of non-coding RNA that plays an important role in posttranscriptional regulation of mRNA. Evidence has shown that miRNA gene variability might interfere with its function resulting in phenotypic variation and disease susceptibility. A major role in miRNA target recognition is ascribed to complementarity with the miRNA seed region that can be affected by polymorphisms. In the present study, we developed an online tool for the detection of miRNA polymorphisms (miRNA SNiPer) in vertebrates (http://www.integratomics-time.com/miRNA-SNiPer) and generated a catalog of miRNA seed region polymorphisms (miR-seed-SNPs) consisting of 149 SNPs in six species. Although a majority of detected polymorphisms were due to point mutations, two consecutive nucleotide substitutions (double nucleotide polymorphisms, DNPs) were also identified in nine miRNAs. We determined that miR-SNPs are frequently located within the quantitative trait loci (QTL), chromosome fragile sites, and cancer susceptibility loci, indicating their potential role in the genetic control of various complex traits. To test this further, we performed an association analysis between the mmu-miR-717 seed SNP rs30372501, which is polymorphic in a large number of standard inbred strains, and all phenotypic traits in these strains deposited in the Mouse Phenome Database. Analysis showed a significant association between the mmu-miR-717 seed SNP and a diverse array of traits including behavior, blood-clinical chemistry, body weight size and growth, and immune system suggesting that seed SNPs can indeed have major pleiotropic effects. The bioinformatics analyses, data and tools developed in the present study can serve researchers as a starting point in testing more targeted hypotheses and designing experiments using optimal species or strains for further mechanistic studies."
https://openalex.org/W2089192912,"Crocodyliforms were one of the most successful groups of Mesozoic tetrapods, radiating into terrestrial, semiaquatic and marine environments, while occupying numerous trophic niches, including carnivorous, insectivorous, herbivorous, and piscivorous species. Among these taxa were the enigmatic, poorly represented flat-headed crocodyliforms from the late Cretaceous of northern Africa. Here we report a new, giant crocodyliform from the early Late Cretaceous (Cenomanian) Kem Kem Formation of Morocco. Represented by a partial braincase, the taxon has an extremely long, flat skull with large jaw and craniocervical muscles. The skull roof is ridged and ornamented with a broad, rough boss surrounded by significant vascular impressions, likely forming an integumentary structure unique among crocodyliforms. Size estimates using endocranial volume indicate the specimen was very large. The taxon possesses robust laterosphenoids with laterally oriented capitate processes and isolated epipterygoids, features allying it with derived eusuchians. Phylogenetic analysis finds the taxon to be a derived eusuchian and sister taxon to Aegyptosuchus, a poorly understood, early Late Cretaceous taxon from the Bahariya formation. This clade forms the sister clade of crown-group Crocodylia, making these taxa the earliest eusuchian crocodyliforms known from Africa. These results shift phylogenetic and biogeographical hypotheses on the origin of modern crocodylians towards the circum-Tethyean region and provide important new data on eusuchian morphology and evolution."
https://openalex.org/W2090406694,"Renal inflammation modulates angiotensinogen (AGT) production in renal proximal tubular cells (RPTCs) via inflammatory cytokines, including interleukin-6, tumor necrosis factor α, and interferon-γ (IFN-γ). Among these, the effects of IFN-γ on AGT regulation in RPTCs are incompletely delineated. This study aimed to elucidate mechanisms by which IFN-γ regulates AGT expression in RPTCs. RPTCs were incubated with or without IFN-γ up to 48 h. AGT expression, STAT1 and STAT3 activities, and SOCS1 expression were evaluated. RNA interference studies against STAT1, SOCS1, and STAT3 were performed to elucidate a signaling cascade. IFN-γ decreased AGT expression at 6 h (0.61 ±0.05, ratio to control) and 12 h (0.47±0.03). In contrast, longer exposure for 24 and 48 h increased AGT expression (1.76±0.18, EC50 = 3.4 ng/ml, and 1.45±0.08, respectively). IFN-γ treatment for 6 h strongly induced STAT1 phosphorylation and SOCS1 augmentation, and decreased STAT3 activity. However, STAT1 phosphorylation and SOCS1 augmentation waned at 24 h, while STAT3 activity increased. RNA interference studies revealed that activation of STAT1-SOCS1 axis decreased STAT3 activity. Thus, IFN-γ biphasically regulates AGT expression in RPTCs via STAT3 activity modulated by STAT1-SOCS1 axis, suggesting the STAT1-SOCS1 axis is important in IFN-γ-induced activation of the intrarenal renin-angiotensin system.—Satou, R., Miyata, K., Gonzalez-Villalobos, R.

https://openalex.org/W2030819177,"A GABAA receptor β3 subunit mutation, G32R, has been associated with childhood absence epilepsy. We evaluated the possibility that this mutation, which is located adjacent to the most N-terminal of three β3 subunit N-glycosylation sites, might reduce GABAergic inhibition by increasing glycosylation of β3 subunits. The mutation had three major effects on GABAA receptors. First, coexpression of β3(G32R) subunits with α1 or α3 and γ2L subunits in HEK293T cells reduced surface expression of γ2L subunits and increased surface expression of β3 subunits, suggesting a partial shift from ternary αβ3γ2L receptors to binary αβ3 and homomeric β3 receptors. Second, β3(G32R) subunits were more likely than β3 subunits to be N-glycosylated at Asn-33, but increases in glycosylation were not responsible for changes in subunit surface expression. Rather, both phenomena could be attributed to the presence of a basic residue at position 32. Finally, α1β3(G32R)γ2L receptors had significantly reduced macroscopic current density. This reduction could not be explained fully by changes in subunit expression levels (because γ2L levels decreased only slightly) or glycosylation (because reduction persisted in the absence of glycosylation at Asn-33). Single channel recording revealed that α1β3(G32R)γ2L receptors had impaired gating with shorter mean open time.

https://openalex.org/W2114331892,"Oxidative stress contributes to the pathogenesis of many diseases, including heart failure, but the role and regulation of oxidative DNA damage in many cases have not been studied. Here, we set out to examine how oxidative DNA damage is regulated in cardiomyocytes. Compared to normal healthy controls, human hearts in end-stage cardiomyopathy (EsCM) showed a high degree of DNA damage by histological evidence of damage markers, including 8-oxoG and γH2AX (8-oxoG: 4.7±0.88 vs. 99.9±0.11%; γH2AX: 2.1 ± 0.33 vs. 85.0 ± 13.8%; P< 0.01) This raised the possibility that defective DNA repair maybe partly responsible. Indeed, nutrient deprivation led to impaired base-excision repair (BER) in cardiomyocytes in vitro, accompanied by loss of the BER enzyme OGG1, while BER activity was rescued by recombinant OGG1 (control vs. nutrient deprived vs. nutrient deprived+OGG1; 100±2.96 vs. 68.2±7.53 vs. 94.0±0.72%; ANOVA, P<0.01). Hearts from humans with EsCM and two murine models of myocardial stress also showed a loss of OGG1 protein. OGG1 loss was inhibited by the autophagy inhibitor bafilomycin and in autophagy-deficient Atg5-/- mouse embryonic fibroblasts. However, pharmacological activation of autophagy, itself, did not induce OGG1 loss, suggesting that autophagy is necessary but not sufficient for OGG1 turnover, and OGG1 loss requires concurrent nutrient deprivation. Finally, we found that the role of autophagy in nutrient starvation is complex, since it balanced the positive effects of ROS inhibition against the negative effect of OGG1 loss. Therefore, we have identified a central role for OGG1 in regulating DNA repair in cardiomyopathy. The manipulation of OGG1 may be used in future studies to examine the direct contribution of oxidative DNA damage to the progression of heart failure.—Siggens, L., Figg, N., Bennett, M., Foo, R.

Very little is known about how these additional elements contribute to complex function except for Nse2/Mms21, which is an E3 small ubiquitin-like modifier (SUMO) ligase important for Smc5 sumoylation. Characterization of two temperature-sensitive mutants, nse5-ts1 and nse5-ts2, demonstrated the importance of Nse5 within the Smc5/6 complex for its stability and functionality at forks during hydroxyurea-induced replication stress. Both NSE5 alleles showed a marked reduction in Smc5 sumoylation to levels lower than those observed with mms21-11, a mutant of Mms21 that is deficient in SUMO ligase activity. However, a phenotypic comparison of nse5-ts1 and nse5-ts2 revealed a separation of importance between Smc5 sumoylation and the function of the Smc5/6 complex during replication. Only cells carrying the nse5-ts1 allele exhibited defects such as dissociation of the replisome from stalled forks, formation of fork-associated homologous recombination intermediates, and hydroxyurea sensitivity that is additive with mms21-11. These defects are attributed to a failure in Smc5/6 localization to forks in nse5-ts1 cells. Overall, these data support the premise that Nse5 is important for vital interactions between components within the Smc5/6 complex, and for its functionality during replication stress."
https://openalex.org/W1998465906,"The LIM homeodomain gene Islet-1 (ISL1) encodes a transcription factor that has been associated with the multipotency of human cardiac progenitors, and in mice enables the correct deployment of second heart field (SHF) cells to become the myocardium of atria, right ventricle and outflow tract. Other markers have been identified that characterize subdomains of the SHF, such as the fibroblast growth factor Fgf10 in its anterior region. While functional evidence of its essential contribution has been demonstrated in many vertebrate species, SHF expression of Isl1 has been shown in only some models. We examined the relationship between human ISL1 and FGF10 within the embryonic time window during which the linear heart tube remodels into four chambers. ISL1 transcription demarcated an anatomical region supporting the conserved existence of a SHF in humans, and transcription factors of the GATA family were co-expressed therein. In conjunction, we identified a novel enhancer containing a highly conserved ISL1 consensus binding site within the FGF10 first intron. ChIP and EMSA demonstrated its direct occupation by ISL1. Transcription mediated by ISL1 from this FGF10 intronic element was enhanced by the presence of GATA4 and TBX20 cardiac transcription factors. Finally, transgenic mice confirmed that endogenous factors bound the human FGF10 intronic enhancer to drive reporter expression in the developing cardiac outflow tract. These findings highlight the interest of examining developmental regulatory networks directly in human tissues, when possible, to assess candidate non-coding regions that may be responsible for congenital malformations."

CRL4Cdt2 substrates contain a “PIP degron,” which consists of a canonical proliferating cell nuclear antigen (PCNA) interaction motif (PIP box) and an adjacent basic amino acid. Substrates use their PIP box to form a binary complex with PCNA on chromatin and the basic residue to recruit CRL4Cdt2 for substrate ubiquitylation. Using Xenopus egg extracts, we identify an acidic residue in PCNA that is essential to support destruction of all CRL4Cdt2 substrates. This PCNA residue, which adjoins the basic amino acid of the bound PIP degron, is dispensable for substrate binding to PCNA but essential for CRL4Cdt2 recruitment to chromatin. Our data show that the interaction of CRL4Cdt2 with substrates requires molecular determinants not only in the substrate degron but also on PCNA.

Eukaryotic cells contain hundreds of E3 ubiquitin ligases that each ubiquitylate one or more target proteins, modulating their activity or marking them for destruction by the 26 S proteasome (1Deshaies R.J. Joazeiro C.A. RING domain E3 ubiquitin ligases.Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2009; 78: 399-434Crossref PubMed Scopus (1875) Google Scholar). Several of the best-studied E3 ligases regulate cell cycle progression. For example, the Skp2-containing Cullin ring ligase 1 (CRL1Skp2 also known as SCFSkp2) 2The abbreviations used are: CRL1Cullin ring ligase 1CRL4Cullin ring ligase 4MMSmethyl methane sulfonateCDKcyclin-dependent kinasePCNAproliferating cell nuclear antigenIDCLinterdomain connector loopHSShigh speed supernatantLSSlow speed supernatantTAPtandem affinity purification. is composed of a Cul1 scaffold, a Skp1 adaptor, the Skp2 substrate receptor, and Rbx1, which interacts with a ubiquitin-conjugating enzyme.

Other substrates of CRL4Cdt2 are likely to emerge. The activity of CRL4Cdt2 is coupled to DNA replication and damage via PCNA, a homotrimeric, ring-shaped molecule that encircles DNA. Given its topological embrace of DNA, PCNA tethers to DNA any proteins with which it interacts, including DNA polymerases, DNA ligases, chromatin-remodeling factors, and numerous other proteins involved in DNA replication and repair (23Moldovan G.L. Pfander B. Jentsch S. PCNA, the maestro of the replication fork.Cell. 2007; 129: 665-679Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1325) Google Scholar). Most proteins that bind PCNA do so via an eight-amino acid motif called a PIP box (see Fig. 1A, green amino acids). The aromatic and hydrophobic residues in the PIP box interact with a hydrophobic pocket underlying the interdomain connector loop (IDCL) (23Moldovan G.L. Pfander B. Jentsch S.

Chem. 1998; 273: 713-719Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). CRL4Cdt2 substrates contain a PIP box, through which they bind to chromatin-bound PCNA (PCNAchromatin) at sites of DNA damage or at the replication fork. Most CRL4Cdt2 substrates also contain a TD motif at positions 5 and 6 of the PIP box (Fig. 1A, blue amino acids), which confers especially high affinity binding to PCNA (27Havens C.G. Walter J.C. Docking of a specialized PIP Box onto chromatin-bound PCNA creates a degron for the ubiquitin ligase CRL4Cdt2.Mol. Cell. 2009; 35: 93-104Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar, 28Michishita M. Morimoto A. Ishii T. Komori H. Shiomi Y. Higuchi Y. Nishitani H. Positively charged residues located downstream of PIP box, together with TD amino acids within PIP box, are important for CRL4(Cdt2)-mediated proteolysis.Genes Cells. 2011; 16: 12-22Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). However, a PIP box and TD motif are not sufficient for CRL4Cdt2 activity. All substrates also contain a basic residue four amino acids downstream of the PIP box (the “B+4” residue). When this residue is mutated to alanine in Xenopus Cdt1, the resulting protein binds normally to PCNA, but CRL4Cdt2 is not recruited to the Cdt1·PCNA complex (27Havens C.G. Walter J.C. Docking of a specialized PIP Box onto chromatin-bound PCNA creates a degron for the ubiquitin ligase CRL4Cdt2.Mol. Cell. 2009; 35: 93-104Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar). These data explain why most PIP box proteins, such as DNA polymerases, which lack the B+4 residue, are not destroyed. In summary, the above data indicate that, during CRL4Cdt2-mediated proteolysis, a substrate docks onto PCNAchromatin, leading to recruitment of CRL4Cdt2, followed by ubiquitin transfer (see Fig. 1B). Notably, an alternative model has recently been proposed in which CRL4Cdt2 binds PCNA independently of a substrate, and in which the PCNA and Cdt2 binding regions within substrates can be separated (11Kim D.H. Budhavarapu V.N. Herrera C.R. Nam H.W. Kim Y.S. Yew P.R. The CRL4Cdt2 ubiquitin ligase mediates the proteolysis of cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor Xic1 through a direct association with PCNA.Mol. Cell. Biol. 2010; 30: 4120-4133Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). Thus, there is significant disagreement over the role of PCNA in promoting substrate recognition by CRL4Cdt2. In this report, we investigate the mechanism by which CRL4Cdt2 interacts with its substrates to trigger proteolytic degradation. First, we provide evidence against the recent proposal that CRL4Cdt2 and its substrates dock onto PCNA independently of one another (11Kim D.H. Budhavarapu V.N. Herrera C.R. Nam H.W. Kim Y.S. Yew P.R. The CRL4Cdt2 ubiquitin ligase mediates the proteolysis of cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor Xic1 through a direct association with PCNA.Mol. Cell. Biol. 2010; 30: 4120-4133Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar), thereby affirming that CRL4Cdt2 is initially recruited to a PIP degron·PCNA complex. We then addressed whether the sole function of PCNA is to position the substrate's PIP degron for binding to CRL4Cdt2 (indirect role) or if a specific surface of PCNA is required, together with the PIP degron, to recruit CRL4Cdt2 (direct role). In support of the latter model, we identify an acidic residue (Asp-122) on the surface of PCNA that is essential for CRL4Cdt2 activity. Importantly, this residue is not necessary for PIP box binding to PCNA but is essential for CRL4Cdt2 recruitment to the PCNA·PIP degron complex on chromatin. Asp-122 is also essential for CRL4Cdt2 activity in fission yeast. Our findings support the idea that CRL4Cdt2 recognizes the PCNA·PIP degron interface by making direct contacts with residues in both polypeptides. This mechanism suggests new possibilities for the regulation of proteolysis. pCS2+/Xic1 (11Kim D.H. Budhavarapu V.N. Herrera C.R. Nam H.W. Kim Y.S. Yew P.R.

Cells were arrested in G1 phase in Edinburgh minimal medium (65Moreno S. Klar A. Nurse P.

Molecular genetic analysis of fission yeast Schizosaccharomyces pombe.Methods Enzymol. 1991; 194: 795-823Crossref PubMed Scopus (3137) Google Scholar) at 32 °C. nda3–311 strains were grown at 32 °C in rich medium and arrested in M phase by incubation for 4 h at 20 °C. For UV exposure, cells were resuspended in water and irradiated with 100 J/m2 of 254 nm UV light in a 6-mm deep stirred suspension at 20 °C. Protein extracts were made by TCA extraction and analyzed by Western blotting as described previously (39Ralph E. Boye E. Kearsey S.E. DNA damage induces Cdt1 proteolysis in fission yeast through a pathway dependent on Cdt2 and Ddb1.EMBO Rep. 2006; 7: 1134-1139Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). Tandam affinity purification (TAP)-tagged Cdt1 was detected with peroxidase·anti-peroxidase-soluble complex (P1291, Sigma), and α-tubulin was used as loading control and detected with antibody T5168 (Sigma). To study the mechanism of CRL4Cdt2-mediated proteolysis, we used two approaches that involve different types of Xenopus egg extracts (summarized in supplemental Fig. S1). First, DNA that had been treated with MMS to induce methylation damage was added to an HSS of egg cytoplasm. Nucleotide excision repair of the methylation damage involves a PCNA-dependent gap-filling step that promotes destruction of endogenous Cdt1 as well as other substrates by CRL4Cdt2 (7Jin J.

Upon nuclear-envelope assembly around the sperm, chromosomal DNA replication initiates, leading to PCNA-dependent, CRL4Cdt2-mediated proteolysis (7Jin J. Arias E.E. Chen J. Harper J.W. Walter J.C.

Most experiments were performed using DNA damage-induced destruction in HSS, but key conclusions were confirmed using the S phase pathway in LSS. The B+4 residue is conserved in all CRL4Cdt2 substrates (Fig. 1A), and it is known to be essential for Cdt1 destruction (27Havens C.G. Walter J.C.

We wanted to know whether B+4 is also important for destruction of other substrates. We therefore examined Xic1 and Set8.

This study demonstrates the influence of long-term glucose load on patient and technique survival.We surveyed 173 incident PD patients. Long-term glucose load was evaluated by calculating the average dialysate glucose concentration since initiation of PD. Risk factors were assessed by fitting Cox's models with repeatedly measured time-dependent covariates.We noted that older age, higher glucose concentration, and lower residual renal function (RRF) were significantly associated with a worse patient survival. We found that female gender, absence of diabetes, lower glucose concentration, use of icodextrin, higher serum high density lipoprotein cholesterol, and higher RRF were significantly associated with a better technique survival.Long-term glucose load predicted mortality and technique failure in chronic PD patients. These findings emphasize the importance of minimizing glucose load in PD patients."

The anti-inflammatory effects of curcumin have primarily been attributed to its inhibitory effect on NF-κB activity due to redox regulation. In this study, we show that curcumin is an immunosuppressive phytochemical that blocks T cell-activation-induced Ca2+ mobilization with IC50 = ∼12.5 μm and thereby prevents NFAT activation and NFAT-regulated cytokine expression. This finding provides a new mechanism for curcumin-mediated anti-inflammatory and immunosuppressive function. We also show that curcumin can synergize with CsA to enhance immunosuppressive activity because of different inhibitory mechanisms. Furthermore, because Ca2+ is also the secondary messenger crucial for the TCR-induced NF-κB signaling pathway, our finding also provides another mechanism by which curcumin suppresses NF-κB activation.

Curcumin (Diferuloylmethane) is a polyphenol product derived from the rhizomes of plant Curcuma longa widely used for flavoring additives and food preservatives in Asiatic countries. In old Hindu and in traditional Chinese medicine, Curcuma longa has been used for treatment of a variety of inflammatory conditions, skin wounds, hepatic, and biliary disorders (1Ammon H.P. Wahl M.A. Pharmacology of Curcuma longa.Planta Med. 1991; 57: 1-7Crossref PubMed Scopus (1529) Google Scholar). Research over the last 50 years demonstrates that curcumin possesses a variety of pharmacological effects against inflammation and infections from parasites, bacteria, and viruses (2Araújo C.C.

Because of its potent anti-inflammatory properties, curcumin has actively been under clinical trials in various inflammatory conditions e.g. post-surgery, rheumatoid arthritis, osteoarthritis, dyspepsia, gastric ulcer, inflammatory bowel disease and pancreatitis (3Jurenka J.S.

Current studies indicate that curcumin may also have potential in prevention and treatment of tumors (6Aggarwal B.B. Kumar A. Bharti A.C.

Curcumin has been shown to suppress production of a number of inflammatory cytokines including TNF, IL-1, IL-8, IL-12, and chemokines (8Xu Y.X. Pindolia K.R. Janakiraman N. Noth C.J. Chapman R.A.

To a large part, the anti-inflammatory potential of curcumin stems from its antioxidant capacity (depending on the dose) leading to down-regulation of transcription factors, e.g. NF-κB, STAT-1, and STAT-3 (13Singh S.

A later study showed that curcumin could enhance the immunosuppressive activity of cyclosporine A (CsA) 2The abbreviations used are: CsAcyclosporine ATCRT cell receptorPTKprotein-tyrosine kinasesCRACCa2+ release-activated calciumLSMlaser scan microscopyPMAphorbol myristate acetateNFATnuclear factor of activated T cellsIPinositol phosphate. in rat cardiac allografts (17Chueh S.C.

Physiologically, T cell activation via T cell receptor (TCR) engagement initiates activation of SRC protein-tyrosine kinases (PTKs) LCK and FYN which in turn phosphorylate the TCR subunits at tyrosine residues. Phosphorylated TCR subunits function as docking sites for the recruitment of the PTK ZAP70 which subsequently phosphorylates several substrates, the linker for activation of T cells (LAT), SLP76 and phospholipase C-γ (PLC-γ). Activation of PLC-γ by phosphorylation leads to hydrolysis of phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate to inositol 3,4,5-triphosphate (IP3) and diacylglycerol (DAG). DAG activates protein kinase Cθ (PKCθ)/NF-κB and the mitogen-activated protein kinases (MAPK) pathways, whereas, IP3 production triggers release of Ca2+ from intracellular stores in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) (19Baniyash M. TCR zeta-chain down-regulation: curtailing an excessive inflammatory immune response.Nat. Rev. Immunol. 2004; 4: 675-687Crossref PubMed Scopus (291) Google Scholar, 20Feske S. Calcium signaling in lymphocyte activation and disease.Nat. Rev. Immunol. 2007; 7: 690-702Crossref PubMed Scopus (785) Google Scholar). Depletion of Ca2+ stores is then sensed by stromal interaction molecule 1 (STIM1), an ER-resident sensor, which triggers entry of Ca2+ through the Ca2+ release-activated calcium (CRAC) channels in the plasma membrane (20Feske S. Calcium signaling in lymphocyte activation and disease.Nat. Rev. Immunol. 2007; 7: 690-702Crossref PubMed Scopus (785) Google Scholar, 21Hogan P.G. Lewis R.S. Rao A. Molecular basis of calcium signaling in lymphocytes: STIM and ORAI.Annu. Rev. Immunol. 2010; 28: 491-533Crossref PubMed Scopus (619) Google Scholar). Increase in cytoplasmic Ca2+ levels triggers activation of the Ca2+-dependent serine/threonine phosphatase calcineurin, which in turn activates the nuclear factor of activated T cells (NFAT) by dephosphorylation and nuclear translocation. NFAT is a key regulator of T cell function and is essential for activating most T cell cytokine genes (20Feske S. Calcium signaling in lymphocyte activation and disease.Nat. Rev. Immunol. 2007; 7: 690-702Crossref PubMed Scopus (785) Google Scholar, 22Müller M.R. Rao A. NFAT, immunity and cancer: a transcription factor comes of age.Nat. Rev. Immunol. 2010; 10: 645-656Crossref PubMed Scopus (426) Google Scholar). The well-known NFAT inhibitors are CsA and FK506 that have been used in organ transplantation to prevent graft-versus-host disease (23Sigal N.H. Dumont F.J. Cyclosporin A, FK-506, and rapamycin: pharmacologic probes of lymphocyte signal transduction.Annu. Rev. Immunol. 1992; 10: 519-560Crossref PubMed Scopus (657) Google Scholar). Both drugs target calcineurin (24Ke H. Huai Q. Structures of calcineurin and its complexes with immunophilins-immunosuppressants.Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2003; 311: 1095-1102Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). Because curcumin could overcome CsA-resistant T cells (18Ranjan D. Chen C. Johnston T.D. Jeon H. Nagabhushan M. Curcumin inhibits mitogen-stimulated lymphocyte proliferation, NFκB activation, and IL-2 signaling.J. Surg. Res. 2004; 121: 171-177Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar), we asked whether curcumin suppresses NFAT activation and if so by what mechanism curcumin overcomes CsA resistance. In this study, we show that curcumin exerts its immunosuppressive activity by suppressing NFAT activation via a mechanism different from CsA and FK506. We demonstrate that curcumin blocks T cell-stimulation-induced Ca2+ mobilization and thereby prevents calcium signaling in lymphocyte activation. The Jurkat T leukemia cells were cultured in RPMI 1640 medium (Sigma) supplemented with 10% FCS, 50 μg/ml gentamicin, 6 mm HEPES (Sigma), and 2 mm l-glutamine (Sigma) at 37 °C and 5% CO2. Human peripheral blood T cells were prepared as described previously (25Li-Weber M. Treiber M.K. Giaisi M. Palfi K. Stephan N. Parg S. Krammer P.H. Ultraviolet irradiation suppresses T cell activation via blocking TCR-mediated ERK and NF-κB signaling pathways.J. Immunol. 2005; 175: 2132-2143Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). Briefly, peripheral blood mononuclear cells were prepared by Ficoll-Paque (Pharmacia) density centrifugation. Adherent cells were removed by adherence to plastic culture vessels for 1 h. T cells were isolated from the peripheral blood mononuclear cells by rosetting with 2 amino-ethylisothio-uronium-bromide-treated sheep red blood cells. For inductions, cells were stimulated by α-CD3 (OKT3 10 μg/ml) or PMA (5 ng/ml) (Sigma) plus ionomycin (1 μm) (Merck, Darmstadt, Germany) for the indicated time. Curcumin (> 99%) was purchased from Alexis Biochemicals (San Diego, CA). Freshly isolated peripheral blood T cells (1 × 106/ml) were stimulated by PMA (5 ng/ml) plus ionomycin (1 μm) in the absence or presence of curcumin for 24 h. Supernatants were tested for the presence of IL-2 and IFN-γ using an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) specific for human IL-2 and IFN-γ proteins (Becton Dickinson Company, Heidelberg, Germany) according to the manufacturer's instruction. Cells were washed twice with PBS and stained with fluorescent-tagged antibody to CD69 (mAb, FITC; BD Biosciences, Heidelberg, Germany) on ice in the dark. After 30 min of staining, cells were washed twice with PBS and analyzed by FACScan (BD Biosciences). Nuclear proteins were prepared as described previously (25Li-Weber M. Treiber M.K. Giaisi M. Palfi K. Stephan N. Parg S. Krammer P.H. Ultraviolet irradiation suppresses T cell activation via blocking TCR-mediated ERK and NF-κB signaling pathways.J. Immunol. 2005; 175: 2132-2143Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). For cell lysates, T cells were lysed in ice-cold RIPA buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 120 mm NaCl, 1% Nonidet P-40, 0.5% deoxycholate, 1 mm PMSF, 25 mm NaF, 0.1% SDS, 1 mm DTT, 0.2 mm Na3V04, and 20 μl/ml protease inhibitors) for 20 min at 4 °C. Equal amounts of proteins were run on 10% SDS-PAGE gels, transferred onto Hybond-ECL nitrocellulose membrane (GE Healthcare, Munich, Germany). The blot was blocked with 5% BSA in PBS/0.1% Tween 20 for 1 h at room temperature. The blot was washed 3 × 10 min with PBS/Tween 20 and developed with HRP-coupled antibodies in 5% milk powder in PBS/0.1% Tween 20 for 1 h at room temperature, washed again 3 × 10 min at room temperature followed by enhanced Chemiluminescence Reagent Plus (PerkinElmer Life Sciences, Rodgau). The following antibodies were used: the antibodies against NFκB p65 (A, sc-109), p50 (E-10, sc-8414) and YY1 (H-10, sc-7341) antibody from Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc. (Santa Cruz, Heidelberg, Germany); the anti-c-Jun monoclonal antibody from BD-Bioscience-Phamingen (Heidelberg, Germany); the anti-active p38 antibody from NEB (Frankfurt a. Main, Germany); the phosphor-SAPK/JNK (G9, 9255) monoclonal antibody from Cell signaling (Europe) and the anti-NF-ATc1 monoclonal antibody (7A6) from Alexis Biochemicals (Grünberg, Germany). For stripping, membranes were incubated for 30 min at 56 °C in a buffer containing 62.5 mm Tris-HCl, pH 6.7, 2% SDS, and 100 mm β-mercaptoethanol. Jurkat T cells stimulated with PMA/ionomycin for 30 min in the presence or absence of curcumin were fixed with Cytofix/Cytoperm (BD Pharmingen) and washed with Perm/Washing solution (BD Pharmingen) for three times at 4 °C. The cells were incubated with anti-NF-ATc1 for 30 min, washed three times with Perm/Washing solution as before and then stained with anti-IgG Cy3 antibodies for 30 min. The cells were washed with Perm/Washing solution for three times again and subjected to LSM. Slides were coated with poly-l-lysine to increase adhesion and prevent cell motility during microscopy. The nucleus was stained with DAPI. Confocal LSM was performed using a Zeiss LSM 510 UV microscope operating with an argon ion laser (488 nm) and a HeNe laser (543 nm) (Zeiss, Jena, and Oberkochen, Germany). Luciferase reporter construct containing the human IL-2 (−300/+47), the human IFN-γ (−854/+7) promoter, and the multiple NF-AT, AP-1, and NF-κB luciferase constructs were generated previously (25Li-Weber M. Treiber M.K. Giaisi M. Palfi K. Stephan N. Parg S. Krammer P.H. Ultraviolet irradiation suppresses T cell activation via blocking TCR-mediated ERK and NF-κB signaling pathways.J. Immunol. 2005; 175: 2132-2143Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). Jurkat T cells were transfected by electroporation as previously described (25Li-Weber M. Treiber M.K. Giaisi M. Palfi K. Stephan N. Parg S. Krammer P.H. Ultraviolet irradiation suppresses T cell activation via blocking TCR-mediated ERK and NF-κB signaling pathways.J. Immunol. 2005; 175: 2132-2143Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). After overnight recovery, the cells were divided and treated with different doses of curcumin and then further cultured in the absence or presence of PMA (5 ng/ml) and ionomycin (1 μm) for 8 h. Luciferase activity was determined in 10 μl of cell extract using the luciferase assay substrate (Promega Corp., Mannheim, Germany) with a Duolumat LB9507 luminometer (Berthold, Bad Wildbad, Germany). Cells were loaded with 1 μm Fluo-4 (Invitrogen, Darmstadt, Germany) at 37 °C in the dark for 20 min followed by treated with different doses of curcumin for 10 min and then, washed three times with PBS to remove the extracellular Ca2+ and suspended in PBS. The release of Ca2+ was measured by flow cytometry in a FACScan (Becton Dickinson, Sunnyvale, CA) in FL-1 after adding ionomycin (0.5 μm) or αCD3 (OKT3 10 μg/ml). For determination of influx of extra-cellular Ca2+, the intracellular Ca2+ stores were first depleted in the absence of extracellular Ca2+ (in PBS) by either ionomycin or αCD3 for 7 min. The cells were then treated with or without curcumin for 30 s and 1 mm Ca2+ was added back. Calcineurin phosphatase activity was measured using a calcineurin assay kit (Merck). Each reaction (total 50 μl) contained 50 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 100 mm NaCl, 6 mm MgCl2, 0.5 mm CaCl2, 0.5 mm DTT, 0.025% Nonidet P-40, 0.25 μm calmodulin, and 40 units of calcineurin. The reaction was initiated at 30 °C by adding the phosphopeptide substrate to a final concentration of 0.15 mm. In the case of calcineurin inhibition, 5 or 10 μg/ml curcumin or 400 ng/ml CsA plus 200 ng/ml cyclophilin A (BIOMOL Research Laboratories, Inc) was included in the reaction mixture. To investigate the role of curcumin on T cell activation, we used the Jurkat T cell line and peripheral blood T cells (PBT) freshly isolated from healthy donors as model systems. Jurkat or PBT were stimulated with ionomycin, a Ca2+ stimulus, in combination with PMA, which mimics antigen signals for T cell activation, in the absence or presence of different concentrations of curcumin. The effect of curcumin on the status of T cell activation was evaluated by the cell surface expression levels of CD69, an early activation marker of T cells (26Cho N.H. Feng P. Lee S.H. Lee B.S. Liang X. Chang H. Jung J.U. Inhibition of T cell receptor signal transduction by tyrosine kinase-interacting protein of Herpesvirus saimiri.J. Exp. Med. 2004; 200: 681-687Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). The experiment showed that PMA/ionomycin stimulation resulted in increase in CD69 expression in Jurkat and PBT cells. However, in the presence of curcumin (2.5–10 μg/ml equivalent to 7–28 μm), CD69 expression levels were reduced in a dose-dependent manner (Fig. 1, A and B). 5 μg/ml of curcumin (equivalent to 14 μm) reduced CD69 expression to a level comparable to that treated with 50 ng/ml of CsA (Fig. 1C). Suppression of CD69 expression correlated with reduced expression levels of the T cell cytokine IL-2 and IFN-γ (Fig. 2A). High doses of curcumin induces apoptotic cell death in PBT (> 30 μm) and Jurkat T cells (50 μm) (27Piwocka K. Zablocki K. Wieckowski M.R. Skierski J. Feiga I. Szopa J. Drela N. Wojtczak L. Sikora E.

After 24 h stimulation, the supernatants were analyzed for IL-2 and IFN-γ protein production by ELISA. Results are representative of two independent experiments. B, curcumin down-regulates promoter activities of IL-2 and IFN-γ. Luciferase constructs containing the human IL-2 and IFN-γ promoter were transfected into Jurkat T cells. After overnight recovery, transfected cells were split and pre-incubated with different concentrations of curcumin as indicated for 1 h and then stimulated with PMA and ionomycin or left unstimulated for 8 h. The promoter activity was given as luciferase activity. Results are representative of two independent experiments each in triplicate transfections.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) We next investigated the mechanisms by which curcumin down-regulates IL-2 and IFN-γ protein expression. Luciferase reporter plasmids containing promoters of the human IL-2 and IFN-γ were subjected to transient transfection studies into Jurkat T cells. Transfected cells were then stimulated with PMA/ionomycin in the presence or absence of different concentrations of curcumin. Consistent with the protein expression data, the promoter activities of IL-2 and IFN-γ were down-regulated by curcumin in a dose-dependent manner (Fig. 2B). Therefore, curcumin suppresses cytokine expression at the transcriptional levels. Most of inflammatory cytokine genes, including IL-2 and IFN-γ, are activated by the inducible transcription factors NFAT and NF-κB (29Serfling E. Avots A. Neumann M. The architecture of the interleukin-2 promoter: a reflection of T lymphocyte activation.Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1995; 1263: 181-200Crossref PubMed Scopus (201) Google Scholar, 30Sica A. Dorman L. Viggiano V. Cippitelli M. Ghosh P. Rice N. Young H.A. Interaction of NF-κB and NFAT with the interferon-γ promoter.J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 30412-30420Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (370) Google Scholar). Curcumin has been shown to inhibit NF-κB activity in various cell types including T cells and, therefore, inhibition of NF-κB has been suggested to be the main mechanism of curcumin-mediated suppression of cytokine expression (31Gao X. Kuo J. Jiang H. Deeb D. Liu Y. Divine G. Chapman R.A. Dulchavsky S.A. Gautam S.C. Immunomodulatory activity of curcumin: suppression of lymphocyte proliferation, development of cell-mediated cytotoxicity, and cytokine production in vitro.Biochem. Pharmacol. 2004; 68: 51-61Crossref PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar). Because NFAT is a key regulator of T cell function and has been shown to be essential for activating most T cell cytokine genes (32Im S.H. Rao A. Activation and deactivation of gene expression by Ca2+/calcineurin-NFAT-mediated signaling.Mol. Cells. 2004; 18: 1-9PubMed Google Scholar, 33Macian F. NFAT proteins: key regulators of T cell development and function.Nat. Rev. Immunol. 2005; 5: 472-484Crossref PubMed Scopus (1111) Google Scholar), we examined the effect of curcumin on NFAT activity. A luciferase reporter construct containing multiple copies of the NFAT-binding elements derived from the IL-2 promoter was transiently transfected into Jurkat T cells, and the transfected cells were stimulated with PMA/ionomycin in the absence or presence of curcumin. The experiment showed that the transcriptional activity mediated by the NFAT elements was down-regulated by curcumin in a dose-dependent manner (Fig. 3A, left panel). The IL-2 NFAT element is composed of a combined NFAT and AP-1 (Fos/Jun) binding sequence (33Macian F. NFAT proteins: key regulators of T cell development and function.Nat. Rev. Immunol. 2005; 5: 472-484Crossref PubMed Scopus (1111) Google Scholar). However, the same concentrations of curcumin did not suppress the transcriptional activity mediated by the consensus binding sequences for AP-1 (Fig. 3A, middle panel). Consistent with other studies, NF-κB-mediated transcriptional activity was down-regulated by curcumin (Fig. 3A, right panel). This study indicates that besides NF-κB, curcumin may inhibit NFAT transcriptional activity. To investigate the mechanism by which curcumin inhibits NFAT-mediated transcription, we examined the effect of curcumin on nuclear expression of NFAT. Jurkat T cells were stimulated with PMA/ionomycin for 2 h in the absence or presence of different concentrations of curcumin and nuclear proteins were isolated for Western blot analysis with specific antibodies against NFATc1. The experiment showed that NFATc1 was initially absent in the nucleus and rapidly expressed in the nucleus after 2 h of PMA/ionomycin stimulation. However, in the presence of curcumin, the nuclear NFATc1 expression levels were strongly impaired (Fig. 3B). Reduced nuclear expression of Jun and NF-κB (p50/p65) was also observed in the presence curcumin (Fig. 3, C and D). However, the levels of phosphorylated (activated) Jun were not affected by curcumin treatment (Fig. 3C). This may explain why AP-1-mediated transcriptional activity was not impaired by curcumin (Fig. 3A, middle panel). These experiments demonstrate that curcumin inhibits NFAT transcriptional activity by preventing its nuclear translocation. To confirm the suppressive effect of curcumin on nuclear translocation of NF-AT in vivo, we performed confocal LSM analysis. The LSM analysis showed that NFATc1 was translocated from the cytoplasm into the nucleus upon PMA/ionomycin stimulation of Jurkat T cells. However, in the presence of curcumin, the nuclear expression of NFATc1 was blocked (Fig. 4). These data demonstrate that curcumin can inhibit NFAT nuclear expression in stimulated T cells. The NFAT family of proteins is activated by the calcium/calmodulin-dependent phosphatase calcineurin that dephosphorylates and promotes nuclear translocation of NFAT (33Macian F. NFAT proteins: key regulators of T cell development and function.Nat. Rev. Immunol. 2005; 5: 472-484Crossref PubMed Scopus (1111) Google Scholar). Therefore, we asked whether curcumin inhibits NFAT activity by inhibition of calcineurin function. To address this question, an in vitro phosphatase assay was performed in the presence or absence of curcumin. The experiment showed that no reduction in calcineurin activity was seen in the presence of curcumin (Fig. 5A). In contrast, CsA strongly inhibited calcineurin phosphatase activity (Fig. 5A). Therefore, curcumin does not directly inhibit calcineurin activity. It has been shown that NFAT activation can be inhibited by the cellular MAPK JNK and p38 that phosphorylate and promote NFAT nuclear export (34Gómez del Arco P. Martínez-Martínez S. Maldonado J.L. Ortega-Pérez I. Redondo J.M. A role for the p38 MAP kinase pathway in the nuclear shuttling of NFATp.J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 13872-13878Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar, 35Porter C.M. Havens M.A. Clipstone N.A.

Chem. 2000; 275: 3543-3551Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar). Therefore, we asked whether curcumin inhibits NFAT activity by enhancing JNK and p38 activity. To address this question, Jurkat T cells were treated with curcumin for different time periods (Fig. 5B) or in combination with T cell stimulation with PMA/ionomycin (Fig. 5B). Kinetic analysis showed that curcumin alone induced phosphorylation of JNK and p38, but at a rather late time point (8 h) (Fig. 5B). As shown in Fig. 3B, inhibition of NFAT nuclear expression was seen at 2 h of curcumin treatment. In addition, curcumin did not significantly enhance the PMA/ionomycin-induced phosphorylation of JNK and p38 (Fig. 5C). These experiments ruled out the possibility that curcumin inhibits NFAT nuclear expression through enhancing JNK/p38-mediated nuclear export. Because NFAT is a Ca2+-regulated transcription factor, we asked whether curcumin inhibits NFAT activity by interfering with T cell activation-induced Ca2+ signal transduction. To investigate this question, Jurkat T cells were loaded with the Ca2+ indicator Fluo-4 and then stimulated with ionomycin or α-CD3 antibody (which mimic TCR stimulation) in the absence or presence of curcumin. In the absence of curcumin, a rapid rise in cytosolic Ca2+ concentration was seen immediately after stimulation of the cells with ionomycin or with α-CD3 (Fig. 6A, left panel). In the presence of curcumin, the ionomycin- and α-CD3-induced increase in cytosolic Ca2+ concentrations was inhibited in a dose-dependent manner (Fig. 6A, left panel). These data suggest that curcumin blocks Ca2+ efflux from intracellular C"
https://openalex.org/W2023258827,"Background Myelination is an exquisite and dynamic example of heterologous cell-cell interaction, which consists of the concentric wrapping of multiple layers of oligodendrocyte membrane around neuronal axons. Understanding the mechanism by which oligodendrocytes ensheath axons may bring us closer to designing strategies to promote remyelination in demyelinating diseases. The main aim of this study was to follow glial-axonal interactions over time both in vitro and ex vivo to visualize the various stages of myelination. Methodology/Principal Findings We took two approaches to follow myelination over time: i) time-lapse imaging of mixed CNS myelinating cultures generated from mouse spinal cord to which exogenous GFP-labelled murine cells were added, and ii) ex vivo imaging of the spinal cord of shiverer (Mbp mutant) mice, transplanted with GFP-labelled murine neurospheres. We demonstrate that oligodendrocyte-axonal interactions are dynamic events with continuous retraction and extension of oligodendroglial processes. Using cytoplasmic and membrane-GFP labelled cells to examine different components of the myelin-like sheath, we provide evidence from time-lapse fluorescence microscopy and confocal microscopy that the oligodendrocytes' cytoplasm-filled processes initially spiral around the axon in a corkscrew-like manner. This is followed subsequently by focal expansion of the corkscrew process to form short cuffs, which then extend longitudinally along the axons. We predict from this model that these spiral cuffs must extend over each other first before extending to form internodes of myelin. Conclusion These experiments show the feasibility of visualizing the dynamics of glial-axonal interaction during myelination over time. Moreover, these approaches complement each other with the in vitro approach allowing visualization of an entire internodal length of myelin and the ex vivo approach validating the in vitro data."
https://openalex.org/W2033049981,"The scaffolding protein PICK1 (protein interacting with C kinase 1) contains an N-terminal PSD-95/Discs large/ZO-1 (PDZ) domain and a central lipid-binding Bin/amphiphysin/Rvs (BAR) domain. PICK1 is thought to regulate trafficking of its PDZ binding partners but different and even opposing functions have been suggested. Here, we apply ELISA-based assays and confocal microscopy in HEK293 cells with inducible PICK1 expression to assess in an isolated system the ability of PICK1 to regulate trafficking of natural and engineered PDZ binding partners. The dopamine transporter (DAT), which primarily sorts to degradation upon internalization, did not form perinuclear clusters with PICK1, and PICK1 did not affect DAT internalization/recycling. However, transfer of the PICK1-binding DAT C terminus to the β(2)-adrenergic receptor, which sorts to recycling upon internalization, led to formation of PICK1 co-clusters in Rab11-positive compartments. Furthermore, PICK1 inhibited Rab11-mediated recycling of the receptor in a BAR and PDZ domain-dependent manner. In contrast, transfer of the DAT C terminus to the δ-opioid receptor, which sorts to degradation, did not result in PICK1 co-clusters or any change in internalization/recycling. Further support for a role of PICK1 determined by its PDZ cargo was obtained for the PICK1 interaction partner prolactin-releasing peptide receptor (GPR10). GPR10 co-localized with Rab11 and clustered with PICK1 upon constitutive internalization but co-localized with the late endosomal marker Rab7 and did not cluster with PICK1 upon agonist-induced internalization. Our data suggest a selective role of PICK1 in clustering and reducing the recycling rates of PDZ domain binding partners sorted to the Rab11-dependent recycling pathway."
https://openalex.org/W2044355484,"Interpersonal communication involves the processing of multimodal emotional cues, particularly facial expressions (visual modality) and emotional speech prosody (auditory modality) which can interact during information processing. Here, we investigated whether the implicit processing of emotional prosody systematically influences gaze behavior to facial expressions of emotion. We analyzed the eye movements of 31 participants as they scanned a visual array of four emotional faces portraying fear, anger, happiness, and neutrality, while listening to an emotionally-inflected pseudo-utterance (Someone migged the pazing) uttered in a congruent or incongruent tone. Participants heard the emotional utterance during the first 1250 milliseconds of a five-second visual array and then performed an immediate recall decision about the face they had just seen. The frequency and duration of first saccades and of total looks in three temporal windows ([0–1250 ms], [1250–2500 ms], [2500–5000 ms]) were analyzed according to the emotional content of faces and voices. Results showed that participants looked longer and more frequently at faces that matched the prosody in all three time windows (emotion congruency effect), although this effect was often emotion-specific (with greatest effects for fear). Effects of prosody on visual attention to faces persisted over time and could be detected long after the auditory information was no longer present. These data imply that emotional prosody is processed automatically during communication and that these cues play a critical role in how humans respond to related visual cues in the environment, such as facial expressions."

To investigate this process in mammalian cells, we examined TLS across a benzo[a]pyrene dihydrodiol epoxide-derived dG adduct (BPDE-dG) using a plasmid bearing a single BPDE-dG and genetically engineered mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs). In wild-type MEFs, TLS was extremely miscoding (>90%) with G → T transversions being predominant. Knockout of the Rev1 gene decreased both the TLS efficiency and the miscoding frequency. Knockout of the Rev3L gene, coding for the catalytic subunit of pol ζ, caused even greater decreases in these two TLS parameters; almost all residual TLS were error-free. Thus, REV1 and pol ζ are critical to mutagenic, but not accurate, TLS across BPDE-dG. The introduction of human REV1 cDNA into Rev1−/− MEFs restored the mutagenic TLS, but a REV1 mutant lacking the C terminus did not. Yeast and mammalian three-hybrid assays revealed that the REV7 subunit of pol ζ mediated the interaction between REV3 and the REV1 C terminus.

The aim of this study was to determine the long-term incidence of severe D4T-toxicity (requiring drug substitution) and associated risk factors in HIV-infected Cambodians up to six years on antiretroviral treatment (ART). Methodology/Principal Findings This is a retrospective analysis of an observational cohort, using data from an ART program with systematic monitoring for D4T-toxicity. Probabilities of time to D4T substitution due to suspected D4T toxicity (treatment-limiting D4T toxicity) were calculated, a risk factor analysis was performed using multivariate Cox regression modelling. Out of 2581 adults initiating a D4T-containing regimen, D4T was replaced in 276 (10.7%) patients for neuropathy, 14 (0.5%) for lactic acidosis and 957 (37.1%) for lipoatrophy. The main early side effect was peripheral neuropathy (7.0% by 1 year). After the first year, lipoatrophy became predominant, with a cumulative incidence of 56.1% and 72.4% by 3 and 6 years respectively. Older age (aHR 1.8; 95%CI: 1.4–2.3) and lower baseline haemoglobin (aHR 1.7; 95%CI: 1.4–2.2) were associated with the occurrence of neuropathy. Being female (aHR 3.8; 95%CI: 1.1–12.5), a higher baseline BMI (aHR 12.6; 95%CI: 3.7–43.1), and TB treatment at ART initiation (aHR 8.6; 95%CI: 2.7–27.5) increased the likelihood of lactic acidosis. Lipoatrophy was positively associated with female gender (aHR 2.3; 95%CI: 2.0–2.6), an older age (aHR 1.3; 95%CI: 1.1–1.4), and a CD4 count <200 cells/µL (aHR 1.3; 95%CI: 1.1–1.5). Conclusions Stavudine-based treatment regimens in low-income countries are associated with significant long-term toxicities, predominantly lipoatrophy. Close clinical monitoring for toxicity with timely D4T substitution is recommended. Phasing-out of stavudine should be implemented, as costs allows."

The deletion strain hrg-2 (tm3798) was isolated in mutagenesis screens by the National Bioresource Project in Japan (21.Gengyo-Ando K. Mitani S. Characterization of mutations induced by ethyl methanesulfonate, UV, and trimethylpsoralen in the nematode Caenorhabditis elegans.Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2000; 269: 64-69Crossref PubMed Scopus (167) Google Scholar). The allele was confirmed by sequencing and was outcrossed eight times with the N2 Bristol strain. Progeny from genetic crosses were genotyped by PCR on individual worms using sense primer 5′-TTTATGCTCTTCCTGCGAG-3′ and antisense primer 5′-TATACCATGCATCCTCTGC-3′. During the final out-cross, both homozygous mutants and their wild type brood mates were saved for further analysis. Transcriptional (hrg-2::gfp) and translational (hrg-2::HRG-2-YFP) reporter constructs were generated either by fusion PCR or by the multisite Gateway system (Invitrogen). Worms with extrachromosomal arrays or stable transgenic lines were obtained by microinjection or by microparticle bombardment (supplemental Table S1) (22.Praitis V. Casey E. Collar D. Austin J. Creation of low-copy integrated transgenic lines in Caenorhabditis elegans.Genetics. 2001; 157: 1217-1226Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Methods for RNA extraction, Northern blotting, qRT-PCR, and rapid amplification of cDNA ends (RACE) were described previously (6.Rajagopal A. Rao A.U. Amigo J. Tian M. Upadhyay S.K. Hall C. Uhm S. Mathew M.K. Fleming M.D. Paw B.H. Krause M. Hamza I. Haem homeostasis is regulated by the conserved and concerted functions of HRG-1 proteins.Nature. 2008; 453: 1127-1131Crossref PubMed Scopus (223) Google Scholar). The hrg-2 primers used in this study were sense (5′-GCCTGGCTGATAATCATCTCTTG-3′) and antisense (5′-ATGGACCTTCTTCATAAATAACTTTCG-3′) for qRT-PCR and sense (5′-GCTGAAATGTTATGTCACAAAG-3′) and antisense (5′-TTATTGCCACAGAGATACAGG-3′) for the synthesis of [α-32P]dCTP-labeled cDNA probe. Total worm RNA was first reverse-transcribed into cDNA using oligo(dT) primers. hrg-2 ORF was amplified with primers flanked by BamHI and XhoI restriction sites. Following restriction digestion and DNA purification, the PCR products were cloned into the pcDNA3.1(+)zeo vector (Invitrogen) and the pEGFP-N1 vector as well as its equivalent GFP variant living color vectors (Clontech). Truncated constructs, including HRG-2N, HRG-2ΔGST-N, HRG-2ΔGST-C, and HRG-2ΔN, were introduced into mammalian expression plasmids in a similar way. For yeast studies, untagged or tagged versions of the hrg-2 ORF were cloned into the 2 μ plasmid pYES-DEST52 (Invitrogen) by Gateway cloning or into a modified pYES-DEST52 plasmid (provided by Dr. Caroline Philpott, National Institutes of Health) using primers engineered with BamHI and XbaI restriction sites. cdr-1 and truncated hrg-2 constructs were cloned into the modified pYES-DEST52 plasmid. Transfected HEK293 cells grown on coverslips were fixed with 4% (w/v) paraformaldehyde, permeabilized with 0.2% (v/v) Triton X-100, and blocked in 3% (w/v) bovine serum albumin and 50% (v/v) SuperBlock solution (Pierce). Samples were incubated in a primary polyclonal anti-HA antibody (Sigma) at a 1:2000 dilution followed by goat anti-rabbit IgG secondary antibodies conjugated to either Alexa 488 or Alexa 568 at a 1:6000 dilution. Coverslips were mounted onto slides using ProLong Antifade (Invitrogen). For GFP fluorescence studies, transfected cells were mounted directly onto slides after fixation. Transformed yeast cells were grown under inducing conditions in liquid synthetic complete (SC) medium to mid-log phase. After fixing with 4% (w/v) formaldehyde, cells were treated with zymolyase-100T (United States Biological) to create spheroplasts. Aliquots of the spheroplasts were added to 8-well slides followed by incubation with rabbit polyclonal anti-HA antibody at a 1:2000 dilution (Sigma) and then with Alexa 488-conjugated polyclonal goat anti-rabbit IgG antibody at a 1:5000 dilution. Fluorescent worms were paralyzed in 10 mm levamisole and mounted on 1.2% (w/v) agarose pads on glass slides. GFP, mCherry, and Alexa fluorophores were examined in an LSM 510 laser-scanning confocal microscope with argon (458 and 488 nm) and helium/neon (543 and 633 nm) lasers (Zeiss). Samples of mammalian cells, worms, and yeast were examined using ×63 and ×100 oil immersion objective lenses. Images with a z resolution of 1 μm were acquired and processed in the LSM image browser (Zeiss). The procedure for fluorescence protease protection assay was modified from the protocol by Lorenz et al. (23.Lorenz H. Hailey D.W. Lippincott-Schwartz J. Fluorescence protease protection of GFP chimeras to reveal protein topology and subcellular localization.Nat. Methods. 2006; 3: 205-210Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar). HRG-2-GFP and control plasmid pCFP-CD3δ-YFP (a gift from Dr. Jennifer Lippincott-Schwartz, National Institutes of Health) were transfected into HEK293 cells grown on Lab-Tek chambered coverglasses (Nunc). After 24 h, the cells were washed with KHM buffer (110 mm potassium acetate, 2 mm MgCl2, and 20 mm HEPES, pH 7.3), and the cell chambers were moved to a DMIRE2 epifluorescence microscope (Leica) connected with a Retiga 1300 Mono 12-bit cooled camera. The plasma membrane was permeabilized with 30 μm digitonin for 2 min, and then the cells were immediately incubated in 50 μg/ml proteinase K for 2 min. Images were taken before digitonin treatment, after digitonin treatment, and after proteinase K digestion. Transfected HEK293 cells were lysed in cell lysis buffer (150 mm NaCl, 0.5% (v/v) Triton X-100, and 20 mm HEPES, pH 7.4) for 5 min on ice. Yeast cells were harvested and resuspended in breaking buffer (1 mm dithiothreitol, 20% (v/v) glycerol, and 100 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0) followed by disruption using a FastPrep-24 (MP Biomedicals) Bead Beater (three 30-s pulses at 6.5 m/s) in the presence of acid-washed glass beads. The protein concentration was quantified with Bradford reagent (Bio-Rad). Protein samples were separated by SDS-PAGE and transferred to nitrocellulose membrane (Bio-Rad). After blocking in 5% (w/v) nonfat dry milk, the membranes were incubated in rabbit anti-HA (Sigma) at a 1:2000 dilution or mouse anti-GFP at a 1:5000 dilution. HRP-conjugated secondary antibodies diluted to 1:20,000 were applied to the membranes, and the signals were detected by SuperSignal chemiluminescence reagents (Thermo Scientific) using the gel documentation system (Bio-Rad). Hemin-agarose pulldown assays were performed according to the procedure outlined by Rajagopal et al. (6.Rajagopal A. Rao A.U. Amigo J. Tian M. Upadhyay S.K. Hall C. Uhm S. Mathew M.K. Fleming M.D. Paw B.H. Krause M. Hamza I. Haem homeostasis is regulated by the conserved and concerted functions of HRG-1 proteins.Nature. 2008; 453: 1127-1131Crossref PubMed Scopus (223) Google Scholar). HEK293 cells transfected with hrg-2 or control constructs were treated with heme-depleted medium with or without 10 μm heme. Each binding reaction contained 300 nmol of hemin-agarose and 500 μg of HRG-2 cell lysate or the equivalent amount of target proteins from other cell lysates. After removing the unbound cell lysates, the hemin-agarose pellets were washed three times with 1 ml of wash buffer (150 mm NaCl, 1% (v/v) Nonidet P-40, and 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0) and three times with 1 ml of radioimmune precipitation assay buffer (150 mm NaCl, 1% (v/v) Nonidet P-40, 0.5% (w/v) sodium deoxycholate, 0.1% (w/v) SDS, and 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.9). The bound proteins were eluted by incubating them in 8 m urea and Laemmli sample-loading buffer containing 100 mm dithiothreitol for 5 min at room temperature and then boiling for 3 min. Equivalent amounts of input protein (input), the flow-through after radioimmune precipitation assay buffer washes (wash), and the eluted protein (bound) were subjected to electrophoresis in 4–20% polyacrylamide gels and immunoblotting with HA antibodies. Each heme binding assay was performed at least twice. HEK293 cells were maintained in DMEM (Invitrogen) supplemented with 10% (v/v) fetal bovine serum and penicillin/streptomycin/glutamine. DNA constructs were transiently transfected into HEK293 cells using Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen) for Western blotting studies and FuGENE 6 (Roche Applied Science) for immunofluorescence assays. To deplete intracellular heme, HEK293 cells were grown in heme-depleted growth medium supplemented with 0.5 mm succinylacetone, an inhibitor of the heme synthesis pathway, for 24 h. The fetal bovine serum (10%) for this medium was depleted of endogenous heme by incubating it with 10 mm ascorbic acid for 7 h at 37 °C followed by dialysis three times in phosphate-buffered saline (24.Zhu Y. Hon T. Ye W. Zhang L. Heme deficiency interferes with the Ras-mitogen-activated protein kinase signaling pathway and expression of a subset of neuronal genes.Cell Growth Differ. 2002; 13: 431-439PubMed Google Scholar). HA-tagged hrg-2 and the pcDNA3.1(+) Zeo vector were transcribed and translated in vitro using the TnT-coupled wheat germ extract system (Promega). One microgram of each plasmid DNA was added to wheat germ lysates in the presence of amino acids and TnT RNA polymerase. The reactions were incubated at 30 °C for 2 h. The samples were subjected to SDS-PAGE and immunoblotting. The heme-deficient Saccharomyces cerevisiae strain DY1457 hem1Δ(6D) was kindly provided by Dr. Caroline Philpott. This hem1Δ strain lacks the gene encoding δ-aminolevulinic acid synthase, which is the rate-limiting enzyme in the heme biosynthesis pathway (25.Crisp R.J. Pollington A. Galea C. Jaron S. Yamaguchi-Iwai Y. Kaplan J. Inhibition of heme biosynthesis prevents transcription of iron uptake genes in yeast.J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 45499-45506Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). hem1Δ yeast were maintained on enriched yeast extract-peptone-dextrose (YPD) or SC media (−Ura) supplemented with 250 μm δ-aminolevulinic acid. Expression plasmids containing control or hrg-2 constructs were transformed into hem1Δ yeast using polyethylene glycol and lithium acetate. Positive clones were isolated by plating the transformants onto the selective SC medium, lacking uracil. Residual δ-aminolevulinic acid was removed by incubating the transformants in SC liquid medium without δ-aminolevulinic acid for 16 h. Equal numbers of transformed yeast were inoculated onto growth assay plates containing SC medium with 2% (w/v) raffinose and 0.4% (w/v) galactose for gene induction as well as different concentrations of hemin chloride. Yeast growth was analyzed after incubation at 30 °C for 3–5 days as described (7.Yuan X. Protchenko O. Philpott C.C. Hamza I. Topologically conserved residues direct heme transport in HRG-1-related proteins.J. Biol. Chem. 2012; 287: 4914-4924Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). Oxygen consumption was measured in wild type W303 and hem1Δ (6D) S. cerevisiae transformed with pYES-DEST52 containing hrg-2, hrg-4, cdr-1, or vector. Transformants were induced in SC medium containing 2% (w/v) raffinose with 0.8% (w/v) galactose and 5 μm hemin chloride for 16 h in triplicate. Cultures were then diluted to an A600 of 1.0 in the same growth medium and assayed in a 3-ml volume in the electrode chamber with constant stirring at room temperature (23 °C). Oxygen consumption was monitored with a Clark-type electrode, YSI model 5300. Oxygen consumption was linear, and the slope was calculated for each sample. The total protein content of the whole yeast lysate was determined by BCA assay, and the rate was calibrated to μM O2/min/mg of protein. Statistical analysis was carried out using one-way ANOVA and the Student-Newman-Keuls multiple comparison test in GraphPad Instat. Triplicate biological replicates of hrg-2 (tm3978) and wild type brood mate animals obtained after eight back-crosses were grown in axenic mCeHR-2 liquid medium supplemented with 20 μm hemin chloride for one generation (P0). Synchronized F1 worms were subsequently grown at either 4 or 20 μm heme, and the ensuing F2 progeny were synchronized, grown at their respective heme concentrations, and harvested at the late L4 larval stage. Total RNA was extracted from these populations as reported previously and subjected to Affymetrix whole genome expression microarray probing with the resulting data analyzed by both MAS5.0 (Affymetrix) and Robust Multichip Average (RMA; Partek Software Suite). Approximately 1 × 106 hrg-2 (tm3798) and wild type brood mate L1 larvae were grown for one generation in axenic liquid mCeHR-2 medium with 4 or 20 μm heme. F2 progeny obtained from these F1 mothers were grown subsequently to the L4 larval stage in the corresponding concentration of heme in mCeHR-2 medium. Worm pellets were lysed in 0.5× buffer (50 mm HEPES, pH 7.4, 100 mm KCl, and 250 mm sorbitol) with protease inhibitors (1 mm PMSF, 0.02 mg/ml leupeptin, and 0.01 mg/ml pepstatin) at 16,000 psi using a French pressure cell. The crude extract was cleared by centrifugation at 1000 × g for 15 min at 4 °C. The supernatant was then fractionated by centrifugation at 100,000 × g for 1 h at 4 °C to obtain a membrane-enriched pellet and a cytosol-enriched supernatant. The membrane fraction was resuspended in buffer with fresh protease inhibitors. Both the membrane and cytosolic fractions were assayed for protein concentration using Bradford protein assay prior to cytochrome quantitation. Triton X-100 (1.0% (w/v)) was added to membrane fractions, and samples were sonicated for 30 s in ice, the material centrifuged at 10,000 × g for 10 min, and the supernatant fraction collected for analysis. Soluble cell fractions were analyzed directly. Protoheme was quantitated by the pyridine hemochromogen assay (26.Smith K.M. Porphyrins and Metalloporphyrins. Elsevier Scientific Publishing Co., New York1975Google Scholar). Cytochrome content was determined by oxidized minus reduced spectroscopy with a Cary 1G spectrophotometer (27.Rieske J.S. The quantitative determination of mitochondrial hemoproteins.Methods Enzymol. 1967; : 488-493Crossref Scopus (139) Google Scholar). Samples were reduced by dithionite immediately prior to determinations. Although ferricyanide was employed as an oxidant, it was found that prepared samples were maximally oxidized. BLAST searches were applied to identify homologous genes of hrg-2. A putative ortholog was assigned when it had a significant E value (<10−4) and met the criterion of reciprocal best BLAST hit. Molecular weights and isoelectric points were calculated in the Compute pI/Mw program (28.Bjellqvist B. Basse B. Olsen E. Celis J.E. Reference points for comparisons of two-dimensional maps of proteins from different human cell types defined in a pH scale where isoelectric points correlate with polypeptide compositions.Electrophoresis. 1994; 15: 529-539Crossref PubMed Scopus (404) Google Scholar). Transmembrane domains and protein motifs were predicted using the transmembrane prediction with the Hidden Markov Model program (TMHMM) and the conserved domain database (CDD), respectively. Multiple sequence alignment was performed using ClustalW (29.Thompson J.D. Higgins D.G. Gibson T.J. CLUSTAL W: improving the sensitivity of progressive multiple sequence alignment through sequence weighting, position-specific gap penalties and weight matrix choice.Nucleic Acids Res. 1994; 22: 4673-4680Crossref PubMed Scopus (55629) Google Scholar) and was visualized with the BoxShade program. Following multiple sequence alignment of HRG-2 and CDR-1 proteins, a phylogenetic tree was constructed using the neighbor-joining method in MEGA 4 (Molecular Evolutionary Genetics Analysis, version 4.0) with 1000 pseudoreplicates (30.Saitou N. Neil M. The neighbor-joining method: a new method for reconstructing phylogenetic trees.Mol. Biol. Evol. 1987; 4: 406-425PubMed Google Scholar, 31.Tamura K. Dudley J. Nei M. Kumar S. MEGA4: Molecular Evolutionary Genetics Analysis (MEGA) software, version 4.0.Mol. Biol. Evol. 2007; 24: 1596-1599Crossref PubMed Scopus (25548) Google Scholar). The CdCl2 induction assays used a 2 × 2 factorial design with two levels of heme concentrations and two levels of CdCl2 concentrations. The main effects of heme and CdCl2 on the expression of hrg-2 or cdr-1 were tested by two-way ANOVA in GraphPad Prism, version 5. Statistical significance in all other experiments was tested using one-way ANOVA followed by the Tukey-Kramer multiple comparisons test in GraphPad INSTAT, version 3.01 (GraphPad, San Diego). All data are presented as mean ± S.E., and a p value of <0.05 was considered statistically significant. C. elegans requires environmental heme to sustain growth and development. In response to changes in heme concentrations, worms have been shown to regulate the expression of 288 heme-responsive genes (hrg) of which 80 genes are up-regulated at low heme (6.Rajagopal A. Rao A.U. Amigo J. Tian M. Upadhyay S.K. Hall C. Uhm S. Mathew M.K. Fleming M.D. Paw B.H. Krause M. Hamza I.

Genome-wide analysis reveals novel genes essential for heme homeostasis in Caenorhabditis elegans.PLoS Genet. 2010; 6: e1001044Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). To identify candidate genes that may function in heme homeostasis, we categorized genes which encoded proteins with homology to other heme-binding proteins and were highly up-regulated at low heme. The gene K01D12.14 was up-regulated more than 70-fold when worms were grown at 4 μm heme (Table 1). K01D12.14 was previously annotated as cadmium-responsive gene-5 (cdr-5) because of its amino acid sequence homology to cdr-1, although K01D12.14 expression, unlike cdr-1, was neither induced nor repressed by cadmium (33.Cui Y.

A single ∼900-bp mRNA was detected by Northern blotting only at low heme supplementation (Fig. 1A). Quantitative RT-PCR confirmed that K01D12.14 mRNA expression was up-regulated by more than"
https://openalex.org/W2031408824,"M-channels are voltage-gated potassium channels that regulate cell excitability. They are heterotetrameric assemblies of Kv7.2 and Kv7.3 subunits. Their opening requires the presence of the membrane phospholipid phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate (PI(4,5)P2). However, the specificity of PI(4,5)P2 as a binding and activating ligand is unknown. Here, we tested the ability of different phosphoinositides and lipid phosphates to activate or bind to M-channel proteins. Activation of functional channels was measured in membrane patches isolated from cells coexpressing Kv7.2 and Kv7.3 subunits. Channels were activated to similar extents (maximum open probability of ∼0.8 at 0 mV) by 0.1–300 μm dioctanoyl homologs of the three endogenous phosphoinositides, PI(4)P, PI(4,5)P2, and PI(3,4,5)P3, with sensitivity increasing with increasing numbers of phosphates. Non-acylated inositol phosphates had no effect up to 100 μm. Channels were also activated with increasing efficacy by 1–300 μm concentrations of the monoacyl monophosphates fingolimod phosphate, sphingosine 1-phosphate, and lysophosphatidic acid but not by phosphate-free fingolimod or sphingosine or by phosphate-masked phosphatidylcholine or phosphatidylglycerol. An overlay assay confirmed that a fusion protein containing the full-length C terminus of Kv7.2 could bind to a broad range of phosphoinositides and phospholipids. A mutated Kv7.2 C-terminal construct with reduced sensitivity to PI(4,5)P showed significantly less binding to most polyphosphoinositides. We concluded that M-channels bind to, and are activated by, a wide range of lipid phosphates, with a minimum requirement for an acyl chain and a phosphate headgroup. In this, they more closely resemble inwardly rectifying Kir6.2 potassium channels than the more PI(4,5)P2-specific Kir2 channels. Notwithstanding, the data also support the view that the main endogenous activator of M-channels is PI(4,5)P2. M-channels are voltage-gated potassium channels that regulate cell excitability.

One such channel is the M-type potassium channel. This is a voltage-gated potassium channel composed of Kv7 family subunits, primarily Kv7.2 and Kv7.3 (4Wang H.S. Pan Z. Shi W. Brown B.S. Wymore R.S.

They are particularly interesting because their sensitivity to PI(4,5)P2 is set at such a level that they rapidly close when the endogenous membrane content of PI(4,5)P2 is reduced by a neurotransmitter such as acetylcholine that activates phospholipase C and so stimulates PI(4,5)P2 hydrolysis (2Gamper N.

Pathways modulating neural KCNQ/M (Kv7) potassium channels.Nat. Rev. Neurosci. 2005; 6: 850-862Crossref PubMed Scopus (544) Google Scholar). The loss of outward potassium current then initiates a marked increase in the excitability of many neurons, with profound physiological consequences (9Brown D.A. Passmore G.M.

Ion channels (and other proteins) vary in the specificity of their interaction with PI(4,5)P2 vis-à-vis other phosphoinositides or other membrane phospholipids (3Suh B.C. Hille B. PIP2 is a necessary cofactor for ion channel function: how and why?.Annu. Rev. Biophys. 2008; 37: 175-195Crossref PubMed Scopus (495) Google Scholar). Kv7.2/7.3 channels appear to show a rather specific dependence on PI(4,5)P2 in that activity is rapidly and substantially reduced when the 5′-phosphate is cleaved by an inositol-5-phosphatase (10Suh B.C.

Furthermore, in experiments in which the individual channel subunits were expressed and then isolated membrane patches were exposed to the water-soluble PI(4,5)P2 analog diC8PI(4,5)P2, the two subunits showed a very large (∼100-fold) difference in the concentrations of diC8PI(4,5)P2 required to activate them (7Li Y.

This was attributable to variations within a small cluster of basic amino acids in a region of the C terminus of the subunit protein, suggesting a specific PI(4,5)P2 interaction site (11Hernandez C.C.

Furthermore, a C-terminal fusion protein of the homologous cardiac Kv7.1 channel was noted to bind to a variety of phosphoinositides and phospholipids in a protein-lipid overlay assay (12Thomas A.M.

Chem. 2011; 286: 2088-2100Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). This raised the question of how broad might be the range of phosphoinositides and lipid phosphates that can interact with Kv7.2/7.3 channels. In these experiments, we have tried to answer this question by (a) testing a range of phosphoinositides and their analogs and derivatives for their ability to activate Kv7.2/7.3 channels when applied to an isolated membrane patch in which they are expressed and (b) using a lipid overlay assay to observe the binding of a Kv7.2 C-terminal fusion protein to a number of membrane phospholipids. From this, we have been able to draw some conclusions regarding the minimum requirements for M-channel activation by membrane phospholipids and lipid phosphates. Electrophysiological experiments were undertaken using CHO cells stably cotransfected with the full-length human Kv7.2 and Kv7.3 M-channel subunits (designated Kv7.2/7.3 cells) (13Main M.J. Cryan J.E. Dupere J.R. Cox B. Clare J.J. Burbidge S.A. Modulation of KCNQ2/3 potassium channels by the novel anticonvulsant retigabine.Mol. Pharmacol. 2000; 58: 253-262Crossref PubMed Scopus (271) Google Scholar). For in vitro binding tests, the full-length C terminus of Kv7.2 (Kv7.2C; amino acids 318–845; NCBI accession number NM_004518) was cloned into the pMAL-c2X vector (New England Biolabs) to create a C-terminal fusion with maltose-binding protein (MBP). MBP-Kv7.2C was expressed and purified as described previously (12Thomas A.M. Harmer S.C. Khambra T. Tinker A. Characterization of a binding site for anionic phospholipids on KCNQ1.J. Biol. Chem. 2011; 286: 2088-2100Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). Experiments were repeated using the full-length C terminus of the mutant channel Kv7.2(K452E/R459E/R461E) (called Kv7.2C-EEE), which is ∼2-fold less sensitive to PI(4,5)P2 than the wild-type channel when expressed as a homomer (11Hernandez C.C. Zaika O. Shapiro M.S. A carboxyl-terminal interhelix linker as the site of phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate action on Kv7 (M-type) K+ channels.J. Gen. Physiol. 2008; 132: 361-381Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). Kv7.2/7.3-CHO cells were incubated in α-minimal essential medium (Invitrogen) supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum, 1% l-glutamine, 1% penicillin/streptomycin, 0.2 mg/ml hygromycin, and 0.4 mg/ml neomycin. The cell line was maintained in a humidified incubator gassed with 5% CO2 and 95% air. Cells were passaged every 2–3 days at a ratio of 1:10. Ca2+- and Mg2+-free phosphate-buffered Hanks' balanced saline solution was used to detach the cells. This was subsequently followed by centrifugation at 800 × g and resuspension in the supplemented medium described above. For subsequent electrophysiological experimentation, cells were settled in specially designed siliconized chambers (volume of ∼200 μl) within plastic Petri dishes. They were incubated for at least 24 h before being mounted on the stage of an inverted microscope equipped with phase-contrast optics and continuously superfused at ∼5 ml/min. Single M-channel activity was recorded using patch electrodes in membrane patches excised from Kv7.2/7.3-CHO cells in inside-out configuration at a controlled room temperature (22 ± 0.5 °C). Pipette voltage was set at 0 mV. For current recording, we used an Axopatch 200A amplifier and Digidata 1440 A/D interface (Axon Instruments, Forster City, CA) and a pipette holder optimized for low-noise recordings (G23 Instruments, University College London). All recordings were filtered with an 8-pole Bessel filter at 2 kHz and digitized at 5 kHz. The pipette resistance when filled with the pipette solution was ∼5–10 megohms. Recorded channel currents were judged to be through a single class of heteromeric Kv7.2/7.3 channels because they had a constant single current amplitude of 0.52 ± 0.01 pA at 0 mV (n = 27 patches). In parallel studies on these cells, a channel slope conductance of 9.2 ± 0.1 picosiemens (n = 6) was determined in cell-attached mode, in agreement with previous data (7Li Y. Gamper N. Hilgemann D.W.

Bath and pipette solutions contained 144 mm NaCl, 2.5 mm KCl, 0.5 mm MgCl2, 2 mm CaCl2, 10 mm d-glucose, and 5 mm HEPES; the pH was adjusted to 7.4 with Trizma (Tris base). Bath solutions in the inside-out studies contained 165 mm KCl, 5 mm HEPES, and 10 mm EGTA; the pH was adjusted to 7.2 with NaOH. Non-hydrolyzable ATPγS (0.1 μm) was constantly present in the bath solutions in inside-out studies to inhibit endogenous production of PI(4,5)P2 by phosphatidylinositol-phosphate kinases, which possibly remained associated with the patch after excision. All compounds studied were applied to the isolated inside-out membrane patches in incremental concentrations using a fast microperfusion system (delivery time of <1 s). All applied phospholipids were reversible. The effects of water-soluble phosphoinositides recovered within 100–500 ms on washout. A longer recovery time (up to 10 s) was needed to wash out compounds dissolved in methanol, which itself slightly depressed M-channel activity. Single channel current amplitudes were determined individually in each patch using a Gaussian all-point amplitude distribution. Because in these experiments we were concerned only with open probability (Po) values, not open-shut time distributions, we included patches with several channels in the analysis. The number of channels (N) in multichannel patches was determined in two ways: first, by observing the number of incremental current steps attained as Po rose to 0.6–0.8; and second, by using variance analysis. In the latter, current variance (Var(Im)) was fitted to the mean current (Im) using the parabolic function shown in Equation 1,Var(x)=Varbackground+iunitIm−Im2N(Eq. 1) with the unit current (iunit) constrained to the value estimated from the point amplitude distribution. Values for N were accepted if the two estimates agreed to the nearest whole number. Patch NPo was measured over the last 20 s of each concentration of phospholipid, when activity was stable as judged from stability plots, and then corrected for the estimated number of channels in each patch to give channel Po as a function of phospholipid concentration. The concentrations for half-activation (EC50) were calculated from concentration-response curves of the Po using two-component Hill equations (15Telezhkin V. Brown D.A. Gibb A.J. Stoichiometry of potassium M-channel activity by PIP2, Program 340.1, Poster F20, 2010 Neuroscience Meeting Planner.

Two-component curves were found to fit the Po/[phospholipid] concentration-response curves of heteromeric M-channels significantly better than one-component curves. Statistical comparisons were performed using one-way analysis of variance, and the difference was considered as significant at the level of p < 0.05. Data were analyzed using Clampfit Version 10.2, WinEDR, Microsoft Office Excel 2003 and MicroCal Origin Version 6.0 software. Purified MBP-Kv7.2C was incubated with PIP Strips (Invitrogen) at a concentration of 5 μg/ml as described previously (16Thomas A.M. Brown S.G. Leaney J.L. Tinker A.

Rabbit anti-MBP antiserum (New England Biolabs) and ECL detection were used to detect binding of MBP-Kv7.2C to the relevant phospholipids. Densitometric analysis was carried out using Scion Image. Experiments were repeated using mutant Kv7.2C-EEE, which is ∼2-fold less sensitive to PI(4,5)P2 than the wild-type channel when expressed as a homomer (11Hernandez C.C. Zaika O. Shapiro M.S.

Phosphatidylinositol mono-, bis-, and trisphosphates (diC8PI(4)P, diC8PI(4,5)P2 and diC8PI(3,4,5)P3), inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate (I(1,4,5)P3), sphingosine 1-phosphate (S-1-P), d-erythro-sphingosine, and biotinylated phosphatidylglycerol (PG) and phosphatidylcholine (PC) were purchased from Echelon Inc. Fingolimod phosphate (FTY720-P), fingolimod (FTY720), and 1-oleoyl lysophosphatidic acid (LPA) were purchased from Cayman Chemical Co. I(4,5)P2/triethanolamine salt was provided by Prof. B. V. L. Potter. Stock solutions of S-1-P, d-erythro-sphingosine, fingolimod phosphate, fingolimod, LPA, PG, and PC were dissolved in methanol (maximum concentration applied to patch of 12%). PI(4,5)P2 is normally synthesized from PI(5)P by PI5K and then can be further phosphorylated to PI(3,4,5)P3 by PI3K (Fig. 1) (18Osborne S.L. Meunier F.A. Schiavo G. Phosphoinositides as key regulators of synaptic function.Neuron. 2001; 32: 9-12Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). We therefore tested the effect of incremental concentrations of the diC8 analogs of these three phosphoinositides on the activity of Kv7.2/7.3 channels in excised membrane patches held at a constant pipette voltage of 0 mV. All three produced a strikingly similar activation of the channels (Fig. 2, A–C). As previously noted for diC8PI(4,5)P2 (15Telezhkin V. Brown D.A. Gibb A.J. Stoichiometry of potassium M-channel activity by PIP2, Program 340.1, Poster F20, 2010 Neuroscience Meeting Planner. Society for Neuroscience, San Diego, CA2010Google Scholar), incremental concentrations between 0.1 and 300 μm generated a biphasic concentration-Po curve, resolvable into “high-affinity” and “low-affinity” components; the former maximized at Po = 0.19 (0.10 for diC8PI(4)P), whereas the latter carried Po up to an extrapolated value approaching ∼0.8 (Fig. 2D). The three phosphoinositides had very similar EC50 values (EC50(1) = 1.1–1.7 μm) for the high-affinity component, whereas the low-affinity EC50 (EC50(2)) varied inversely with the number of phosphates (Table 1). As a result, diC8PI(4)P produced a slightly lower observed Po (0.61 ± 0.10, n = 9) at the maximum applied concentration of 300 μm compared with diC8PI(4,5)P2 (0.79 ± 0.05, n = 11) or diC8PI(3,4,5)P3 (0.80 ± 0.04, n = 11) (Table 1). Thus, diC8 homologs of all three endogenous phosphoinositides strongly activated the M-channels, with a potency that increased with increasing numbers of phosphates.FIGURE 2M-type channel activity stimulated by diC8 phosphatidylinositides.

Open table in a new tab Studies on other potassium channels indicate that the inositol phosphate headgroup of PI(4,5)P2 projects from the inner leaflet of the lipid bilayer into the cytoplasm, where it docks onto a receptive site (or sites) in the cytoplasmic domain of the channel (19Stansfeld P.J. Hopkinson R. Ashcroft F.M. Sansom M.S. PIP2-binding site in Kir channels: definition by multiscale biomolecular simulations.Biochemistry. 2009; 48: 10926-10933Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar, 20Hansen S.B. Tao X. MacKinnon R. Structural basis of PIP2 activation of the classical inward-rectifier K+ channel Kir2.2.Nature. 2011; 477: 495-498Crossref PubMed Scopus (436) Google Scholar). The above results suggest that the charges on the headgroup are one factor governing the ability of phosphoinositides to activate M-channels. We therefore wondered whether the inositol phosphates themselves might activate the Kv7.2/7.3 channels or, conversely, compete with PI(4,5)P2 to inhibit its action. These are not unreasonable possibilities because (a) the PI(4,5)P2-binding pleckstrin homology domain of the membrane enzyme phospholipase C also binds I(1,4,5)P3 with high affinity (21Garcia P. Gupta R. Shah S. Morris A.J. Rudge S.A. Scarlata S. Petrova V. McLaughlin S. Rebecchi M.J.

U.S.A. 1995; 92: 10472-10476Crossref PubMed Scopus (477) Google Scholar), and (b) I(1,4,5)P3 has been reported to antagonize the effect of PI(4,5)P2 on some transient receptor potential cation channels (23Ju M. Shi J. Saleh S.N. Albert A.P. Large W.A. Ins(1,4,5)P3 interacts with PIP2 to regulate activation of TRPC6/C7 channels by diacylglycerol in native vascular myocytes.J. Physiol. 2010; 588: 1419-1433Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). Accordingly, we applied incremental concentrations of I(1,4,5)P3 to excised Kv7.2/7.3-containing patches as illustrated in Fig. 3A. No channel activation occurred up to 300 μm in any of six experiments, whereas in each case, 100 μm PI(4,5)P2 increased Po to an average value of 0.54 ± 0.09 (n = 6). Furthermore, 100 μm I(1,4,5)P3 did not inhibit the effect of PI(4,5)P2 when applied either before or during the application of 100 μm PI(4,5)P2, so the mean Po remained unaffected (0.58 ± 0.08, n = 5) (Fig. 3B). I(4,5)P2 (n = 5) or a small water-soluble monophosphate, dihydroxyacetone phosphate (n = 8), also had no effect at concentrations of 100 μm (data not shown). Thus, water-soluble analogs of the phosphoinositide headgroups do not activate M-channels. The above results indicate that, although the docking of the inositol headgroups of the phosphoinositides onto the cytoplasmic domain of the channel may be responsible for channel opening, attachment of the phosphate to a lipophilic moiety is necessary for (or facilitates) this effect. This accords with recent structural information regarding inwardly rectifying Kir channels, in which the acyl chain of PI(4,5)P2 interacts nonselectivity with the transmembrane domain of Kir2 (20Hansen S.B. Tao X. MacKinnon R. Structural basis of PIP2 activation of the classical inward-rectifier K+ channel Kir2.2.Nature. 2011; 477: 495-498Crossref PubMed Scopus (436) Google Scholar). To assess what the minimum lipophilic acyl phosphate requirement for M-channel activation might be, we tested the effect of several other phospholipids and their congeners (Fig. 4): S-1-P, its analog fingolimod phosphate, and LPA, whose aliphatic structure corresponds in principle to PI(4,5)P2. S-1-P activated the channels at concentrations of 3 μm upward to a mean Po of 0.16 ± 0.03 (n = 9) at 100 μm (Fig. 5, A and B). Fingolimod phosphate also activated the channels over the same concentration range but only to a lower mean Po of 0.02 ± 0.006 (n = 8) (Fig. 5C). Concentration-Po curves (Fig. 5D) could be resolved into two (high- and low-affinity) components like those generated by the phosphoinositides (Table 2). In both cases, incorporating two components gave a significantly better fit than a single component. This suggests that they acted mechanistically, rather like the phosphoinositides.TABLE 2Activation of Kv7.2/7.3 M-channels by non-inositol lipid monophosphatesS-1-PFTY720-PLPAHigh-affinity component EC50(1) (μm)3.2 ± 0.60.5 ± 0.0011.5 ± 0.4 Po(max1)0.072 ± 0.006aValues significantly differ from the Po(max1) of PI(4,5)P2 (p < 0.02).0.007 ± 0.000001aValues significantly differ from the Po(max1) of PI(4,5)P2 (p < 0.02).0.204 ± 0.027Low-affinity component EC50(2) (μm)157.3 ± 40.863.2 ± 0.240.0 ± 9.2 Po(max2)0.26 ± 0.043bValues significantly differ from the Po(max2) and combined Po(max) of PI(4,5)P2 (p < 0.000006 and p < 0.0000000001 for S-1-P and fingolimod phosphate, respectively).0.021 ± 0.00006bValues significantly differ from the Po(max2) and combined Po(max) of PI(4,5)P2 (p < 0.000006 and p < 0.0000000001 for S-1-P and fingolimod phosphate, respectively).0.626 ± 0.075Combined Po(max)0.26 ± 0.05bValues significantly differ from the Po(max2) and combined Po(max) of PI(4,5)P2 (p < 0.000006 and p < 0.0000000001 for S-1-P and fingolimod phosphate, respectively).0.02 ± 0.006bValues significantly differ from the Po(max2) and combined Po(max) of PI(4,5)P2 (p < 0.000006 and p < 0.0000000001 for S-1-P and fingolimod phosphate, respectively).0.68 ± 0.09 nH1.5 ± 0.21.8 ± 0.00421.3 ± 0.2 ncNumber of patches at each concentration.6–158–114–12a Values significantly differ from the Po(max1) of PI(4,5)P2 (p < 0.02).b Values significantly differ from the Po(max2) and combined Po(max) of PI(4,5)P2 (p < 0.000006 and p < 0.0000000001 for S-1-P and fingolimod phosphate, respectively).c Number of patches at each concentration.

Again, the concentration-Po curve could be resolved into two components, although less clearly demarcated than with PI(4,5)P2 (Fig. 6C and Table 2). Hence, the property of activating M-channels is not totally restricted to diacylphosphoinositides but extends to some monoacyl phosphates. As noted, the acyl groups of phosphoinositides interact with the transmembrane domain of the Kir2 channels (20Hansen S.B. Tao X. MacKinnon R.

https://openalex.org/W2078624525,"Considerable progress in our understanding of the population genetic changes associated with biological invasions has been made over the past decade. Using selectively neutral loci, it has been established that reductions in genetic diversity, reflecting founder effects, have occurred during the establishment of some invasive populations. However, some colonial organisms may actually gain an ecological advantage from reduced genetic diversity because of the associated reduction in inter-colony conflict. Here we report population genetic analyses, along with colony fusion experiments, for a highly invasive colonial ascidian, Didemnum vexillum. Analyses based on mitochondrial cytochrome oxidase I (COI) partial coding sequences revealed two distinct D. vexillum clades. One COI clade appears to be restricted to the probable native region (i.e., north-west Pacific Ocean), while the other clade is present in widely dispersed temperate coastal waters around the world. This clade structure was supported by 18S ribosomal DNA (rDNA) sequence data, which revealed a one base-pair difference between the two clades. Recently established populations of D. vexillum in New Zealand displayed greatly reduced COI genetic diversity when compared with D. vexillum in Japan. In association with this reduction in genetic diversity was a significantly higher inter-colony fusion rate between randomly paired New Zealand D. vexillum colonies (80%, standard deviation ±18%) when compared with colonies found in Japan (27%, standard deviation ±15%). The results of this study add to growing evidence that for colonial organisms reductions in population level genetic diversity may alter colony interaction dynamics and enhance the invasive potential of newly colonizing species."

We found on chromatography of native intestinal cytosol over a Sephacryl S-100 HR column that FABP1 (14 kDa) eluted in a volume suggesting a 75-kDa protein complex that contained four proteins on an anti-FABP1 antibody pulldown. The FABP1-containing column fractions were chromatographed over an anti-FABP1 antibody adsorption column. Proteins co-eluted from the column were identified as FABP1, Sar1b, Sec13, and small VCP/p97-interactive protein by immunoblot, LC-MS/MS, and MALDI-TOF. The four proteins of the complex had a total mass of 77 kDa and migrated on native PAGE at 75 kDa. When the complex was incubated with intestinal ER, there was no increase in FABP1-ER binding. However, when the complex member Sar1b was phosphorylated by PKCζ and ATP, the complex completely disassembled into its component proteins that migrated at their monomer molecular weight on native PAGE. FABP1, freed from the complex, was now able to bind to intestinal ER and generate the pre-chylomicron transport vesicle (PCTV). No increase in ER binding or PCTV generation was observed in the absence of PKCζ or ATP.

The intestinal absorptive cell performs many complex operations in the process of absorbing dietary nutrients. Of these, the absorption of dietary lipid is among the most multifaceted. Most dietary lipid is made available for absorption as fatty acids (FA) 2The abbreviations used are: FAfatty acidTAGtriacylglycerolPCTVpre-chylomicron transport vesicleSVIPsmall VCP/p97-interactive proteinCOPIIcoat protein complex IIERendoplasmic reticulum. and sn-2-monoacylglycerols, the hydrolytic products of triacylglycerols (TAG), in the intestinal lumen. The enterocyte has little control over the amount of FA and sn-2-monoacylglycerols presented for absorption and no well defined control over the rate at which these lipids are absorbed. It must rapidly convert them to the more physicochemically inert TAG, however, or risk cell membrane disruption (1Strålfors P. Autolysis of isolated adipocytes by endogenously produced fatty acids.FEBS Lett. 1990; 263: 153-154Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). fatty acid triacylglycerol pre-chylomicron transport vesicle small VCP/p97-interactive protein coat protein complex II endoplasmic reticulum. Accordingly, the re-synthesis of the split lipids to TAG occurs extremely rapidly (2Mansbach 2nd, C.M. Nevin P. Intracellular movement of triacylglycerols in the intestine.J. Lipid Res. 1998; 39: 963-968Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) at the level of the ER. Diet-derived TAG in the ER is then incorporated into the intestine's unique TAG-rich transport lipoprotein, the chylomicron, in a two-step process (3Cartwright I.J. Higgins J.A. Direct evidence for a two-step assembly of ApoB48-containing lipoproteins in the lumen of the smooth endoplasmic reticulum of rabbit enterocytes.J. Biol.

Because of the size of chylomicrons, 250 nm average (6Zilversmit D.B. Formation and transport of chylomicrons.Fed. Proc. 1967; 26: 1599-1605PubMed Google Scholar), and the presence of lipase in intestinal cytosol (7Mahan J.T. Heda G.D. Rao R.H. Mansbach 2nd, C.M. The intestine expresses pancreatic triacylglycerol lipase. Regulation by dietary lipid.Am. J. Physiol. Gastrointest. Liver Physiol. 2001; 280: G1187-G1196Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), we postulated that a cargo-specific, sealed transport vesicle would be required to transport the chylomicrons from the ER to the Golgi. In support of this hypothesis, we isolated and characterized the pre-chylomicron transport vesicle (PCTV) (8Siddiqi S.A. Gorelick F.S. Mahan J.T. Mansbach 2nd, C.M. COPII proteins are required for Golgi fusion but not for endoplasmic reticulum budding of the pre-chylomicron transport vesicle.J. Cell Sci. 2003; 116: 415-427Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar) that accomplishes this task. The formation of PCTV is highlighted by our finding that the ER budding step for PCTV is rate-limiting in the transit of dietary TAG from the ER to the lymph (2Mansbach 2nd, C.M. Nevin P. Intracellular movement of triacylglycerols in the intestine.J. Lipid Res. 1998; 39: 963-968Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). These data led us to concentrate on the mechanisms by which PCTV are budded from the ER. There are multiple differences between PCTV generation and that of vesicles that transport newly synthesized proteins (protein vesicles) from the ER to the Golgi. These include the cargo selection process and the machinery for budding the vesicles from ER membranes. In contrast to protein vesicles that require COPII proteins for their initiation (9Aridor M. Fish K.N. Bannykh S. Weissman J. Roberts T.H. Lippincott-Schwartz J. Balch W.E. The Sar1 GTPase coordinates biosynthetic cargo selection with endoplasmic reticulum export site assembly.J.

Chem. 2007; 282: 17974-17984Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). Also, in contrast to protein vesicles that require ATP and GTP to bud (13Aridor M. Balch W.E.

Chem. 2000; 275: 35673-35676Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar), FABP1, in the absence of both ATP and GTP, can bind to the ER (12Neeli I. Siddiqi S.A. Siddiqi S.

Lipid Res. 2010; 51: 1918-1928Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). This finding is confusing because our original studies, using whole cytosol, identified ATP (not GTP) as being necessary for PCTV budding to occur (8Siddiqi S.A. Gorelick F.S. Mahan J.T. Mansbach 2nd, C.M. COPII proteins are required for Golgi fusion but not for endoplasmic reticulum budding of the pre-chylomicron transport vesicle.J. Cell Sci. 2003; 116: 415-427Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar). These conflicting data created a conundrum in which ATP was found to be necessary for PCTV budding when whole cytosol is used, but ATP was not required when FABP1 was utilized to initiate budding. Furthermore, native cytosol contains 2% of total protein as FABP1 (15Bass N.M. Manning J.A. Ockner R.K. Gordon J.I. Seetharam S. Alpers D.H. Regulation of the biosynthesis of two distinct fatty acid-binding proteins in rat liver and intestine. Influences of sex difference and of clofibrate.J. Biol. Chem. 1985; 260: 1432-1436Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) suggesting that adequate amounts of FABP1 would be present in the cytosol to bud PCTV. These data could be rationalized if FABP1 in cytosol were sequestered from binding to the ER until ATP was provided. The treatment of native cytosol with ATP enabling PCTV budding to occur suggests the involvement of a kinase. We have identified the putative kinase as the atypical protein kinase C, PKCζ. Immunodepletion of this kinase greatly attenuates PCTV budding activity that is restored by adding recombinant PKCζ to the depleted cytosol (16Siddiqi S.A. Mansbach 2nd, C.M. PKCζ-mediated phosphorylation controls budding of the pre-chylomicron transport vesicle.J. Cell Sci. 2008; 121: 2327-2338Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). In support of this finding, ER membranes incubated with PKCζ-depleted cytosol do not form the PCTV budding complex despite the addition of ATP (14Siddiqi S. Saleem U. Abumrad N.A. Davidson N.O. Storch J. Siddiqi S.A. Mansbach 2nd, C.M. A novel multiprotein complex is required to generate the prechylomicron transport vesicle from intestinal ER.J. Lipid Res. 2010; 51: 1918-1928Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). This study tests the hypothesis that FABP1 is a member of a cytosolic multiprotein complex that blocks FABP1 from binding to the ER unless it is treated with PKCζ and ATP. We further identify the substrate for PKCζ as Sar1b, mutations of which result in chylomicron retention disease (17Georges A. Bonneau J. Bonnefont-Rousselot D. Champigneulle J. Rabès J.P. Abifadel M.

Immunoblot reagents were purchased from Bio-Rad. ECL reagents were procured from GE Healthcare. Protease inhibitor mixture tablets were obtained from Roche Applied Science. Albumin was purchased from Sigma. PKCζ was purchased from StressGen Biotechnologies (Victoria, Canada). Other biochemicals used were of analytical grade and were purchased from local companies. Rats, 150–200 g, were purchased from Harlan (Indianapolis, IN). Polyclonal antibodies against FABP1 were a generous gift from Dr. Judith Storch (Rutgers University). Polyclonal anti-small VCP/p97-interactive protein (SVIP) antibodies were generated commercially (Alpha Diagnostic, Inc. San Antonio, TX), and the results were compared with anti-SVIP antibodies generously provided by Dr. Mitsuo Tagaya (School of Life Science, Tokyo University of Pharmacy and Life Science, Tokyo, Japan). The protein identified by the antibody was confirmed as SVIP by MALDI-TOF with a Z score of 1.9. Polyclonal antibodies to Sar1b were also generated by Alpha Diagnostic using an 18-mer from 102 and an 18-mer from 133. Both peptides were injected into the same rabbit. The antibodies generated could not distinguish Sar1a from Sar1b (Fig. 5B). The anti-Sar1 and anti-SVIP antibodies were generated under the direction of Dr. Shadab A. Siddiqi (University of Central Florida, Orlando) while a member of the laboratory. Polyclonal antibodies to Sec13 were a kind gift of Dr. Chris Kaiser (Massachusetts Institute of Technology, Cambridge, MA). Goat anti-rabbit IgG conjugated with agarose beads was purchased from Sigma. Goat anti-rabbit IgG, goat anti-mouse IgG, and goat anti-rabbit IgG conjugated with horseradish peroxidase were purchased from Santa Cruz Biotechnology (Santa Cruz, CA). Immunogenic peptides used to generate antibodies to SVIP and Sar1 and the recombinant protein, FABP1, were incubated with their respective antibodies to determine whether the signal on immunoblot generated by the antibody could be extinguished. In each case, the antibody gave a strong signal for the protein against which it was directed in intestinal cytosol. This signal was completely blocked by prior incubation of the antibody with its immunogenic peptide (Sar1, SVIP) or recombinant protein (FABP1). These data suggest the monospecificity of the antibodies employed. Antibody inhibition was not done for Sec13 because the immunogenic peptide was not available, although the antibody has been characterized previously (19Shugrue C.A. Kolen E.R. Peters H. Czernik A. Kaiser C. Matovcik L. Hubbard A.L. Gorelick F. Identification of the putative mammalian orthologue of Sec31P, a component of the COPII coat.J. Cell Sci. 1999; 112: 4547-4556Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Enterocytes from the proximal half of male Sprague-Dawley rat small intestine were isolated and radiolabeled with [3H]oleate as described previously (8Siddiqi S.A. Gorelick F.S. Mahan J.T. Mansbach 2nd, C.M. COPII proteins are required for Golgi fusion but not for endoplasmic reticulum budding of the pre-chylomicron transport vesicle.J. Cell Sci. 2003; 116: 415-427Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar). In brief, the isolated enterocytes were incubated with albumin-bound [3H]oleate for 30 min at 35 °C and washed twice with PBS containing 2% BSA to remove the excess [3H]oleate. The labeled enterocytes were homogenized using a Parr bomb, and the cytosol was isolated. The cytosol was dialyzed against Buffer A (0.25 m sucrose, 30 mm HEPES (pH 7.2), 30 mm KCl, 5 mm MgCl2, 5 mm CaCl2, 2 mm DTT) overnight at 4 °C and concentrated 5-fold using a 50-ml Amicon filter with a YM10 membrane (Amicon, Beverly, MA). This cytosol was further concentrated on a Centricon filter (Amicon) with a 10-kDa cutoff to 20 mg of protein/ml. Enterocytes from the proximal half of male Sprague-Dawley rat small intestines were isolated and radiolabeled with [3H]oleate as described (20Kumar N.S. Mansbach C.M. Determinants of triacylglycerol transport from the endoplasmic reticulum to the Golgi in intestine.Am. J. Physiol. 1997; 273: G18-G30PubMed Google Scholar). In brief, enterocytes were isolated from intestinal villi, collected, incubated with albumin-bound [3H]oleate for 30 min at 35 °C, and washed with 2% BSA to remove the excess [3H]oleate. The labeled enterocytes were homogenized using a Parr bomb, and the ER was isolated using a sucrose step gradient, which was repeated to purify the ER (21Siddiqi S.A. Mahan J. Siddiqi S. Gorelick F.S. Mansbach 2nd, C.M. Vesicle-associated membrane protein 7 is expressed in intestinal ER.J. Cell Sci. 2006; 119: 943-950Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). 1 mg of cytosol was applied to a Sephacryl S-100 HR column (1.5 cm × 45 cm) previously equilibrated with PBS (pH 7.2). The flow rate was 0.5 ml/min, and the cytosol was eluted with PBS (pH 7.2) at 4 °C. 1-ml fractions were collected. 3H disintegrations/min radioactivity was determined by liquid scintillation spectroscopy for each fraction. For immunoblot, proteins in each fraction were concentrated using a Millipore centrifugal filter unit (Millipore Corp., Billerica, MA) and suspended in Laemmli's buffer. The presence of FABP1 in each fraction was analyzed by immunoblot using anti-FABP1 antibodies as indicated. 500 μg of protein from the gel filtration column was purified using a SulfoLink coupling gel kit according to the manufacturer's instructions (Pierce) in three steps. In brief, 10 μl of anti-FABP1 antibody was incubated with 6 mg of 2-methylamine at 37 °C for 1.5 h. This reduced sample was first incubated with a SulfoLink coupling gel column for 15 min at room temperature (RT) by rocking and another 30 min without rocking. Second, the nonspecific binding sites on the column gel were blocked by first incubating 15.8 mg of l-cysteine for 15 min at RT by rocking and then for 30 min without rocking. The column was washed with PBS. Third, 1 ml (500 μg of protein) of the sample was applied to the SulfoLink coupling column and incubated for 2 h at RT; the column was washed with 15 ml of sample buffer, and the bound proteins were eluted by applying 8 ml of 100 mm glycine buffer (pH 2.5). 1-ml fractions were collected, immediately neutralized by 1 m Tris (pH 9.0), and kept at 4 °C. The fractions were pooled and concentrated using a Millipore centrifugal filter unit. For immunoblots, proteins were separated by SDS-PAGE and then transblotted to nitrocellulose membranes (Bio-Rad). After blocking the membrane with 5% Blotto, the membranes were incubated with specific primary antibodies and then peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibodies. Labeled proteins were detected using ECL (GE Healthcare) and Biomax film (Eastman Kodak Co.). For native gels, samples were not boiled, and SDS or DTT was not used in the sample preparation or running gel buffer. Otherwise, the procedure was the same as with the SDS-polyacrylamide gels. For autoradiography, proteins were separated by SDS-PAGE, 2D gels, or native PAGE. The gels were rinsed three times with distilled water, dried, and autoradiographed using Kodak Biomax film at −70 °C for 10 days. Cytosol (250 μg of protein) or the 75-kDa protein complex (150 μg of protein) were solubilized in 500 μl of sample buffer (7 m urea, 2 m thiourea, 4% CHAPS, 2 mm tri-butyl phosphine, 0.5% carrier ampholyte, 40 mm Tris) for 1 h at 37 °C. The solubilized protein sample was loaded onto immobilized pI gradient gel (IPG) strips (pH 3–11 or pH 5.3–6.5) (GE Healthcare) by incubation (RT) overnight. Isoelectric focusing was performed using a Multiphor II apparatus (GE Healthcare). A total of 50,500 V-h was applied to each IPG strip. After isoelectric focusing, the IPG strip was first equilibrated in buffer I (0.5 m Tris-HCl (pH 6.8), 6 m urea, 30% glycerol (v/v), 2% SDS, 25 mm DTT) for 10 min and then in buffer II (0.5 m Tris-HCl (pH 6.8), 6 m urea, 30% glycerol (v/v), 2% SDS, 12 mm iodoacetamide) for 10 min. For the second dimension, the proteins were separated on an 8–18% SDS-polyacrylamide gel, transblotted onto nitrocellulose membranes, and probed with specific antibodies. Immunoprecipitation of proteins from fractions 3 to 5 of the Sephacryl S-100 HR column was accomplished by incubating the eluted fractions (250 μg of protein) with 10 μl of anti-FABP1 antibody at 4 °C for 4 h. 40 μl of anti-rabbit IgG bound to agarose beads (Sigma) were added and incubated for another 4 h at 4 °C. The beads were collected by centrifugation, washed 10 times with cold PBS, and resuspended in Laemmli's buffer. The proteins were separated by native or SDS-PAGE, transblotted to a nitrocellulose membrane, and immunoblotted using anti-SVIP, Sec13, or Sar1 antibodies. Detection was by ECL. The 75-kDa complex (150 μg) was incubated with 5 μg of recombinant PKCζ, an ATP-generating system (1 mm ATP, 5 mm phosphocreatine, 5 units of creatine phosphokinase), 50 μCi of [γ-32P]ATP, 2 mm NaF, 5 mm Mg2+, 2 mm DTT, and 2.5 mm Ca2+ for 30 min at 37 °C or as indicated. Postincubation, the reaction was stopped by placing the tubes on ice and by adding cold HEPES buffer (10 mm) supplemented with 10 units of apyrase. [3H]TAG-pre-loaded intestinal ER was used to generate PCTV containing [3H]TAG (8Siddiqi S.A. Gorelick F.S. Mahan J.T. Mansbach 2nd, C.M. COPII proteins are required for Golgi fusion but not for endoplasmic reticulum budding of the pre-chylomicron transport vesicle.J. Cell Sci. 2003; 116: 415-427Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar). In brief, [3H]TAG-loaded ER (500 μg) was incubated at 37 °C for 30 min with cytosol (1 mg) and an ATP-regenerating system in the absence of Golgi acceptor (total volume 500 μl). When the 75-kDa protein complex was used to generate PCTV instead of cytosol, PKCζ (5 μg) and an ATP-generating system were used. The incubation mixture was resolved on a continuous sucrose gradient (0.1–1.15 m sucrose) and PCTV isolated from the light portions of the gradient. The PCTV thus formed were concentrated using a Millipore centrifugal filter unit. 30 μg of cytosolic protein was separated by SDS-PAGE, transblotted to nitrocellulose membranes, and immunoblotted using specific antibodies as indicated. To test for the specificity of the antibodies utilized, prior to incubating the transblotted membrane with antibody, the antibodies were first incubated with either their immunogenic peptide or FABP1 as indicated. The antibodies were incubated with 3-fold (by weight) excess of the immunogenic peptide or FABP1 in 500 μl of PBS overnight at 4 °C. Following the incubation, the antibody-peptide or FABP1 mixture was diluted. The treated antibody was used to probe the nitrocellulose membrane after it was treated with 5% Blotto and washed with PBS. Detection was by ECL. The purified four-membered protein complex (5, 10, and 15 μg of protein) was separated by SDS-PAGE, and the proteins were stained by SimplyBlue SafeStain. The gel was completely destained, and each of the four-protein bands were scanned and their densities determined by using the Gel Doc XR. The three differing protein concentrations gave similar results on a per mg basis indicating that the measured densities were proportional to the amount of protein present. The oleate concentration in the protein complex was determined by the [3H]oleate-specific activity fed to the primary enterocyte culture (5,000 dpm/10−12 mol) and subsequently the [3H]oleate dpm in a known amount of complex-FABP1. The isolated heterotetramer eluted from the anti-FABP1 adsorption column was separated by SDS-PAGE and stained with SimplySafe Blue (Invitrogen). The bands at 33, 22, 14, and 8.6 kDa were cut from the gel and digested by trypsin. Data were acquired on a Thermo Scientific LTQ Orbitrap (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham, MA) equipped with a Waters nanoAcquity UPLC system using a Waters Symmetry® C18 180-μm × 20-mm trap column and a 1.7-μm, 75-μm × 250-mm nanoAcquityTM UPLCTM column (Waters Corp., Milford, MA) (35 °C) for peptide separation. Trapping was done at 15 μl/min. MS was acquired in the Orbitrap using one microscan over the range 400–2000 m/z at 60,000 resolutions and a maximum injection time of 900 ms, followed by six data-dependent MS/MS acquisitions in the ion trap. The data were searched using The MASCOT Distiller and the MASCOT search algorithm (22Hirosawa M. Hoshida M. Ishikawa M. Toya T. MASCOT. Multiple alignment system for protein sequences based on three-way dynamic programming.Comput. Appl. Biosci. 1993; 9: 161-167PubMed Google Scholar). The data were searched against the MASCOT Swiss-Prot data base using partial methionine oxidation and propionamide-modified cysteine, a peptide tolerance of +20 ppm, MS/MS fragment tolerance of +0.6 Da, and peptide charges of +2 or +3. Normal and decoy data base searches were run. The band at 9 kDa of the complex could not be analyzed by LC-MS/MS because of contaminating peptides derived from predominantly FABP1 but also Sar1. For this reason we did a pulldown using our anti-SVIP antibody and analyzed the one bound protein by MALDI-TOF. The MALDI-TOF was performed as described previously (21Siddiqi S.A. Mahan J. Siddiqi S. Gorelick F.S. Mansbach 2nd, C.M. Vesicle-associated membrane protein 7 is expressed in intestinal ER.J. Cell Sci. 2006; 119: 943-950Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). TAG radioactivity was determined by liquid scintillation spectroscopy. Significant differences between two means were tested by Student's t test using the nonpaired, two-tailed method. When more than two means were compared, analysis of variance was used with post-Bonferroni corrections (Instat, GraphPad, San Diego) in combination with Student's nonpaired two-tailed t test. p < 0.05 was taken as a significant difference between means. To test if absorbed oleate were present in intestinal cytosol bound to FABP1 as a monomer or as part of a multiprotein complex, we incubated primary cultures of rat intestinal cells with [3H]oleate, disrupted the cells, and isolated the cytosol. The cytosol was passed over a Sephacryl S-100 HR column; the eluted fractions were collected, and the oleate disintegrations/min were determined for each fraction. The oleate eluted in a single peak coincident with the elution of conalbumin (76 kDa), clearly different from the elution volumes of albumin ( 66.5 kDa) or FABP1 (14 kDa) (Fig. 1). We suspected that the [3H]oleate marked the elution volume of FABP1. This was confirmed by immunoblot as shown in the inset of Fig. 1. Only minor amounts of FABP1 (Mr ≈14,000) eluted at its monomer molecular weight. Consistent with the data in Fig. 1, cytosol, whose proteins had been separated by native PAGE (no boiling, no SDS, and no DTT) and immunoblotted for FABP1, showed that FABP1 migrated as a 75-kDa protein (Fig. 2A, Native). However, on SDS-PAGE, FABP1 migrated at its expected monomer mass of 14 kDa (Fig. 2A, Boiled). We suspected that FABP1 eluted from the column in a volume suggestive of a protein of ≈75 kDa because it was either part of a multiprotein complex or because FABP1 was present as a pentamer. Performing a nonspecific protein stain on the FABP1-containing fractions from the column would likely have led to a multiplicity of protein bands making interpretation of the results difficult. Therefore, as a first approach to differentiate between a homo- and a multiprotein complex, we performed a pulldown experiment using the column fractions containing the [3H]oleate incubated with anti-FABP1 antibodies attached to beads (Fig. 2B). As shown, we identified three other proteins by immunoblot that interacted with FABP1 by this methodology as follows: Sar1, small VCP/p97 interactive protein (SVIP), and Sec13 (Fig. 2B, IP with FABP1). The identification of these proteins was guided by their kDa and our knowledge of the proteins involved with PCTV budding (14Siddiqi S. Saleem U. Abumrad N.A. Davidson N.O. Storch J. Siddiqi S.A. Mansbach 2nd, C.M. A novel multiprotein complex is required to generate the prechylomicron transport vesicle from intestinal ER.J. Lipid Res. 2010; 51: 1918-1928Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). The same proteins were present in cytosol (Fig. 2B, Cytosol). The total molecular weight of these three proteins plus FABP1 is 77. Each of these proteins was present in the 75-kDa fraction from the column as shown by immunoblot (Fig. 2C). The data from Fig. 2B would suggest that we could concentrate the 75-kDa complex by using an anti-FABP1 antibody adsorption column. In accord with this goal, we collected the [3H]oleate-containing fractions from the Sephacryl S-100 HR column, concentrated them, and passed the concentrate over an anti-FABP1 antibody adsorption column. We used native PAGE to separate the proteins eluted from the column. All the proteins eluted in a single band of ≈75 kDa (Fig. 3A, panel 1). By contrast, on SDS-PAGE, the majority of the proteins from the 75-kDa band now eluted at 50, 33, 21, 14, and 9 kDa by SimplyBlue SafeStain (Fig. 3A, panel 2). That some protein remained at 75 kDa despite"

However, models of angiogenesis by human endothelial cells localized within an intact human prostate tissue architecture are until now extremely limited. This report characterizes the burst of angiogenesis by endogenous human blood vessels in primary xenografts of fresh surgical specimens of benign prostate or prostate cancer (CaP) tissue that occurs between Days 6–14 after transplantation into SCID mice pre-implanted with testosterone pellets. The wave of human angiogenesis was preceded by androgen-mediated up-regulation of VEGF-A expression in the stromal compartment. The neo-vessel network anastomosed to the host mouse vascular system between Days 6–10 post-transplantation, the angiogenic response ceased by Day 15, and by Day 30 the vasculature had matured and stabilized, as indicated by a lack of leakage of serum components into the interstitial tissue space and by association of nascent endothelial cells with mural cells/pericytes. The angiogenic wave was concurrent with the appearance of a reactive stroma phenotype, as determined by staining for α-SMA, Vimentin, Tenascin, Calponin, Desmin and Masson's trichrome, but the reactive stroma phenotype appeared to be largely independent of androgen availability. Transplantation-induced angiogenesis by endogenous human endothelial cells present in primary xenografts of benign and malignant human prostate tissue was preceded by induction of androgen-driven expression of VEGF by the prostate stroma, and was concurrent with and the appearance of a reactive stroma phenotype. Androgen-modulated expression of VEGF-A appeared to be a causal regulator of angiogenesis, and possibly of stromal activation, in human prostate xenografts."
https://openalex.org/W2087263556,"The cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) chloride channel is a member of the ATP-binding cassette (ABC) protein family, most members of which act as active transporters. Actively transporting ABC proteins are thought to alternate between “outwardly facing” and “inwardly facing” conformations of the transmembrane substrate pathway. In CFTR, it is assumed that the outwardly facing conformation corresponds to the channel open state, based on homology with other ABC proteins. We have used patch clamp recording to quantify the rate of access of cysteine-reactive probes to cysteines introduced into two different transmembrane regions of CFTR from both the intracellular and extracellular solutions. Two probes, the large [2-sulfonatoethyl]methanethiosulfonate (MTSES) molecule and permeant Au(CN)2− ions, were applied to either side of the membrane to modify cysteines substituted for Leu-102 (first transmembrane region) and Thr-338 (sixth transmembrane region). Channel opening and closing were altered by mutations in the nucleotide binding domains of the channel. We find that, for both MTSES and Au(CN)2−, access to these two cysteines from the cytoplasmic side is faster in open channels, whereas access to these same sites from the extracellular side is faster in closed channels. These results are consistent with alternating access to the transmembrane regions, however with the open state facing inwardly and the closed state facing outwardly. Our findings therefore prompt revision of current CFTR structural and mechanistic models, as well as having broader implications for transport mechanisms in all ABC proteins. Our results also suggest possible locations of both functional and dysfunctional (“vestigial”) gates within the CFTR permeation pathway. The cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) chloride channel is a member of the ATP-binding cassette (ABC) protein family, most members of which act as active transporters. Actively transporting ABC proteins are thought to alternate between “outwardly facing” and “inwardly facing” conformations of the transmembrane substrate pathway. In CFTR, it is assumed that the outwardly facing conformation corresponds to the channel open state, based on homology with other ABC proteins.

Rapid kinetics measurements with cytochrome c using submillisecond continuous flow mixing devices suggest simultaneous formation of a compact collapsed state and secondary structure. These data seem to indicate that collapse formation is guided by specific short and long range interactions (heteropolymer collapse). A contrasting interpretation also has been proposed, which suggests that the collapse formation is rapid, nonspecific, and a trivial solvent related compaction, which could as well be observed by a homopolymer (homopolymer collapse). We address this controversy using fluorescence correlation spectroscopy (FCS), which enables us to monitor the salt-induced compaction accompanying collapse formation and the associated time constant directly at single molecule resolution. In addition, we follow the formation of secondary structure using far UV CD. The data presented here suggest that both these models (homopolymer and heteropolymer) could be applicable depending on the solution conditions. For example, the formation of secondary structure and compact state is not simultaneous in aqueous buffer. In aqueous buffer, formation of the compact state occurs through a two-state co-operative transition following heteropolymer formalism, whereas secondary structure formation takes place gradually. In contrast, in the presence of urea, a compaction of the protein radius occurs gradually over an extended range of salt concentration following homopolymer formalism. The salt-induced compaction and the formation of secondary structure take place simultaneously in the presence of urea.

Several experimental and theoretical techniques have been devised to study dynamics of the unfolded state and to monitor early events of protein folding (1Eaton W.A. Thompson P.A. Chan C.K. Hage S.J.

Many of these studies involve measurements of rapid kinetics using mixing techniques with sub-millisecond and μs time resolutions (5Akiyama S. Takahashi S. Ishimori K. Morishima I.

Cytochrome c has been found to be an attractive model system for these experiments (9Goldbeck R.A. Chen E. Kliger D.S. Early events, kinetic intermediates, and the mechanism of protein folding in cytochrome c.Int. J. Mol. Sci. 2009; 10: 1476-1499Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). Two long-standing controversial questions related to the nature and time scale of the initial events of protein folding have been addressed by many of these rapid kinetics measurements. First, is it the hydrophobic collapse, which occurs first, followed by the formation of the secondary structure, or do they occur simultaneously? Second, is the initial event of protein folding directed by specific interactions between the participating amino acids, or is it nonspecific? Rapid kinetics measurements show barrier limited formation of a native-like collapsed states in the early time scale (6Shastry M.C. Roder H. Evidence for barrier-limited protein folding kinetics on the microsecond time scale.Nat. Struct. Biol. 1998; 5: 385-392Crossref PubMed Scopus (272) Google Scholar, 10Chen E. Goldbeck R.A. Kliger D.S. The earliest events in protein folding: A structural requirement for ultrafast folding in cytochrome c.J. Am. Chem. Soc. 2004; 126: 11175-11181Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). These experiments and other data seem to suggest that hydrophobic collapse and secondary structure formation take place simultaneously (11Uversky V.N. Fink A.L. The chicken-egg scenario of protein folding revisited.FEBS Lett. 2002; 515: 79-83Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). These studies indicated that collapse is guided by specific short and long range interactions and barrier-limited (heteropolymer collapse) (6, 9–10). A contrasting interpretation was brought up by Sosnick et al. (12Sosnick T.R. Mayne L. Englander S.W. Molecular collapse: The rate-limiting step in two-state cytochrome c folding.Proteins. 1996; 24: 413-426Crossref PubMed Scopus (255) Google Scholar, 13Sosnick T.R. Shtilerman M.D. Mayne L.

U.S.A. 1997; 94: 8545-8550Crossref PubMed Scopus (160) Google Scholar), who suggested that the initial collapse is nonspecific. According to this interpretation, the initial collapse is a trivial compaction, which any homopolymer would experience when the denaturant gets diluted by aqueous buffer (homopolymer collapse). The controversy has been found difficult to resolve because of several reasons. First, the number of experimental techniques, which could probe early change in conformation and μsec dynamics in the unfolded state, is limited. Second, pathways of protein folding are heterogeneous with complications arising from parallel pathways, trapped intermediates, and misfolding. We addressed these questions by making use of fluorescence correlation spectroscopy (FCS) 2The abbreviations used are: FCSfluorescence correlation spectroscopyTMRtetramethyl rodamine 5 maleimideMEMmaximum entropy method. and far UV CD to study the salt-induced collapse and secondary structure formation of cytochrome c from Saccharomyces cerevisiae. Bovine serum albumin also was used to verify some of the key experimental results on a different protein system. FCS is a unique experimental technique that can measure conformation of the unfolded state and its fluctuation dynamics in the μs time scale using the same experimental data. Additionally, FCS offers single molecule sensitivity, which could efficiently isolate folding events from any competing undesired processes such as aggregation. fluorescence correlation spectroscopy tetramethyl rodamine 5 maleimide maximum entropy method. Using FCS, we observed the presence of a fluctuation dynamics between an extended and a collapsed conformer of cytochrome c unfolded at pH 2. The time constant of their interconversion was 50 μs. The equilibrium population of collapsed conformer increased upon the addition of salt as monitored by a decrease in the hydrodynamic radius (rH). Using far UV CD and FCS, we independently monitored the formation of secondary structure and that of the collapsed state, respectively. In aqueous buffer, the formation of collapsed state followed a cooperative two-state transition occurring at low salt concentration (heteropolymer collapse), although secondary structure forms gradually over a large range of salt concentration. In aqueous buffer, these two events are not simultaneous. A salt-induced compaction of the hydrodynamic radius has been observed in the presence of urea. However, the contraction of the unfolded chain and secondary structure formation occurred simultaneously in urea. In the presence of urea, the contraction followed homopolymer formalism. Iso-1-cytochrome c (C2436), sodium perchlorate (CAS-7601-89-0), and urea (CAS-13-6) were obtained from Sigma. Alexa Fluor 488-maleimide and tetramethyl rodamine 5 maleimide (TMR) were obtained from Molecular Probes (Eugene, OR). All of the other reagents used were of the highest available grade. Far UV CD spectra were carried out using a Jasco J715 spectropolarimeter. Experiments were performed typically with 9 μm TMR-maleimide-labeled cytochrome c-TMR. Far-UV CD spectra were recorded over a 200–250-nm range, and each spectrum was averaged using 10 repeat scans. Steady state fluorescence experiments were carried out with TMR-labeled protein using a PTI fluorescence spectrometer (Photon Technology Intl.). The fluorescence emission spectra were recorded between 560–650 nm using an excitation wavelength of 540 nm. Final concentration of the labeled cytochrome c used for the steady-state fluorescence was 1 μm. MALDI mass spectrometry was carried out using a 4800 MALDI-TOF-TOF mass spectrometer (Applied Biosystems) equipped with a microchannel plate detector. The delay time used was 500 ns. Mass spectra were acquired by averaging 600 to 800 shots. Labeled cytochrome c fragment of 1 μm concentration was used for the mass spectrometry measurements. Cytochrome c from S. cerevisiae contains one free cysteine (Cys-102), which was labeled with TMR using published procedures (14Haldar S. Mitra S. Chattopadhyay K. Role of protein stabilizers on the conformation of the unfolded state of cytochrome c and its early folding kinetics: Investigation at single molecular resolution.J. Biol. Chem. 2010; 285: 25314-25323Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). Labeling of BSA with Alexa Fluor 488-maleimide was carried out using an identical method. Labeling of cytochrome c with TMR does not result in any significant effect on the structure, conformation, and folding of the protein (14Haldar S. Mitra S. Chattopadhyay K. Role of protein stabilizers on the conformation of the unfolded state of cytochrome c and its early folding kinetics: Investigation at single molecular resolution.J. Biol. Chem. 2010; 285: 25314-25323Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). FCS experiments were carried out with a ConfoCor 3 LSM setup (Carl Zeiss, Evotec, Jena, Germany) using a 40× water immersion objective. The detailed experimental procedure has been published previously (15Ghosh R. Sharma S. Chattopadhyay K. Effect of arginine on protein aggregation studied by fluorescence correlation spectroscopy and other biophysical methods.Biochemistry. 2009; 48: 1135-1143Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar, 16Haldar S.

For FCS data analysis, correlation function curves observed with the FCS experiments were analyzed using different models as described below. For a single component system without any conformational event, the diffusion time (τD) of a fluorophore (for example, the free dye, TMR or Alexa Fluor 488-maleimide-labeled bovine serum albumin) and the number of particles in the observation volume (N) can be calculated by fitting the correlation function (G(τ)) to Equation 1 (17Haupts U. Maiti S. Schwille P. Webb W.W. Dynamics of fluorescence fluctuations in green fluorescent protein observed by fluorescence correlation spectroscopy.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 1998; 95: 13573-13578Crossref PubMed Scopus (489) Google Scholar),G(τ)=1+1N1ττD11+s2ττD0.5(Eq. 1) where S is the structure parameter, the depth-to-diameter ratio of the Gaussian observation volume. Because the correlation functions obtained with cytochrome c-TMR at pH 2 could not be analyzed using model 1 described above, we needed to use model 2 for the successful representation of the data. This model (model 2) assumes a single diffusing species (with the diffusion time of τD), which undergoes a chemical reaction or conformational change. The correlation function of the system can be represented by Equation 2 (17Haupts U. Maiti S. Schwille P. Webb W.W. Dynamics of fluorescence fluctuations in green fluorescent protein observed by fluorescence correlation spectroscopy.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 1998; 95: 13573-13578Crossref PubMed Scopus (489) Google Scholar).G(τ)=1+1−F+Fexp⁡−τ/τRN(1−F)1+ττD11+S2ττD0.5(Eq. 2) The parameter τR represents the time constant of a conformational fluctuation between a fluorescent and a non-fluorescent conformer (for example, A ⇄ B, and both of the conformers, A and B, have the same τD) provided that the said event occurs faster than the diffusion time (τR ≪ τD). F is the amplitude of τR, which corresponds to the average fraction of the molecules in the non-fluorescent (dark) state (17Haupts U. Maiti S. Schwille P. Webb W.W. Dynamics of fluorescence fluctuations in green fluorescent protein observed by fluorescence correlation spectroscopy.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 1998; 95: 13573-13578Crossref PubMed Scopus (489) Google Scholar). For both Equations 1 and 2, a rapid exponential component with amplitude 20–30% and the time constant of 1–3 μs for the triplet state photophysics also is present. The diffusion coefficient (D) of the molecule can be calculated from τD using Equation 3,τD=ω24D(Eq. 3) where ω is the beam radius of the observation volume, which can be obtained by measuring τD of a fluorophore of known D. The hydrodynamic radius (rH) of a labeled molecule can be calculated from D using the Stokes Einstein equation (Equation 4),D=kT6πηrH(Eq. 4) where k is the Boltzmann constant, T is the temperature, and η corresponds to the viscosity of the solution. FCS data were further analyzed by maximum entropy method (MEM) (18Sengupta P. Garai K. Balaji J. Periasamy N. Maiti S. Measuring size distribution in highly heterogeneous systems with fluorescence correlation spectroscopy.Biophys. J. 2003; 84: 1977-1984Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (175) Google Scholar). This is a model-free method in which the multicomponent correlation function can be represented by n, the number of non-interacting fluorescent species. These species can have diffusion time values between 0.001 and 500 ms. MEM minimizes the parameter χ2 and maximizes the entropic quantity, S = Σipilnpi (where pi = aiΣiaj) to obtain an optimized fit (15Ghosh R. Sharma S. Chattopadhyay K.

J. 2003; 84: 1977-1984Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (175) Google Scholar). FCS has been used extensively to measure hydrodynamic radius (rH) of fluorescently labeled molecules at a single molecule resolution (19Elson E.L. Quick tour of fluorescence correlation spectroscopy from its inception.J. Biomed Opt. 2004; 9: 857-864Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar, 20Hess S.T. Huang S. Heikal A.A. Webb W.W. Biological and chemical applications of fluorescence correlation spectroscopy: A review.Biochemistry. 2002; 41: 697-705Crossref PubMed Scopus (602) Google Scholar). Additionally, FCS has been used to monitor conformational dynamics of biological molecules at μs time scale (3Chattopadhyay K. Elson E.L. Frieden C. The kinetics of conformational fluctuations in an unfolded protein measured by fluorescence methods.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2005; 102: 2385-2389Crossref PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar, 4Chen H. Rhoades E. Butler J.S. Loh S.N. Webb W.W. Dynamics of equilibrium structural fluctuations of apomyoglobin measured by fluorescence correlation spectroscopy.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2007; 104: 10459-10464Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). As a matter of fact, FCS is one of the very few experimental techniques that can measure protein dynamics in the μs time scale. This is because NMR and stopped flow methods are limited by their time resolution typically at ms; time resolved fluorescence decay experiments are effective only at the ns or ps time range. Computational studies including molecular dynamics simulations are frequent at the ns or ps time scale because of computational constraints one would encounter to perform simulations at μs time scale. In a typical FCS experiment, intensity fluctuations of a labeled molecule inside a small observation volume are monitored with time. Intensity fluctuations may arise due to the diffusion of the molecule (with a diffusion time of τD) in or out of the observation volume (Equation 1) or due to the kinetics of a conformational change (with the time constant of τR) whose rate is faster than the molecular diffusion (τR ≪ τD, Equation 2). Analysis of the diffusion component (τD) using Equations 3 and 4 provides hydrodynamic radius (rH). Analysis of the kinetic component provides information about the time constant (τR) of the conformational fluctuations in the μs time scale. We have used FCS and far UV CD to study salt-induced collapse and secondary structure formation of TMR-labeled cytochrome c (cytochrome c-TMR) at pH 2. Labeling with TMR does not affect the conformation and folding of cytochrome c (14Haldar S. Mitra S. Chattopadhyay K. Role of protein stabilizers on the conformation of the unfolded state of cytochrome c and its early folding kinetics: Investigation at single molecular resolution.J. Biol. Chem. 2010; 285: 25314-25323Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar, 21Werner J.H. Joggerst R. Dyer R.B. Goodwin P.M. A two-dimensional view of the folding energy landscape of cytochrome c.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2006; 103: 11130-11135Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). At low pH (for example, at pH 2), the protein becomes positively charged. To avoid the repulsive interactions between the positively charged residues at acidic pH, it unfolds and becomes extended. Unfolding of cytochrome c-TMR at pH 2 leads to a large decrease in the secondary structure as observed by far UV CD experiments (supplemental Fig. S1). The correlation functions obtained by the FCS experiments with cytochrome c-TMR at pH 2 could not be fit to Equation 1 resulting in non-random residual distributions (Fig. 1a). The data instead have been fit to Equation 2 (Fig. 1b), which contains an exponential time constant (τR of 50 μs) in addition to a diffusion component (of diffusion time of τD). Using the τD value obtained from the diffusion component, we have calculated the hydrodynamic radius (rH) of the protein at pH 2 to be 31 Å (using Equations 3 and 4, “Experimental Procedures”). The parameter τR denotes the time constant of a conformational fluctuation occurring between a non-fluorescent and a fluorescent conformer (also see “Experimental Procedures” for explanations of Equations 1 and 2). The parameter F denotes the amplitude of τR describing the relative population of the compact non-fluorescent state in equilibrium. Fitting of the FCS data using two exponential components (1 diffusion + 2 exponential components) does not improve the quality of the fit. The addition of salts (for example, sodium perchlorate) increases the dielectric constant of the aqueous solution. Because the repulsive interactions between the positive charged residues are inversely proportional to the dielectric constant of the medium, the hydrophobic interactions predominate resulting in the compaction of the unfolded state. The value of rH, as observed by FCS experiments with cytochrome c-TMR, decreases with the addition of sodium perchlorate at pH 2 (Fig. 2a), suggesting the formation of a compact collapsed state. The value of rH in the presence of 120 mm sodium perchlorate at pH 2 has been found to be 18 Å. The parameter F increases with the increase in the sodium perchlorate concentration (Fig. 2b), which occurs in concert with the decrease in rH. The value of τR remains at 50 μs at low salt concentration and decreases to 20 μs as the salt induced transition occurs (Fig. 2c). In addition, the presence of 120 mm sodium perchlorate leads to partial refolding of cytochrome c-TMR as observed by an increase in the ellipticity measured by far UV CD (supplemental Fig. S1). The results discussed above could be explained by assuming the presence of a conformational equilibrium between an extended (U, 31 Å) and a compact collapsed (IC, 18 Å) conformer in the unfolded state of cytochrome c-TMR at pH 2.U(extended)⇄Ic(collapsed)(Eq. 5) The presence of an equilibrium containing three states (for example, one described in Equation 6) can be ruled out. This is because, the use of Equation 2 (which represents a two-state equilibrium between U and IC, Equation 5 above) is sufficient to successfully fit the correlation functions data of cytochrome c-TMR at pH 2. The use of an equation containing two exponential components (with time constants of τR1 and τR2) in addition to a diffusion component (of diffusion time of τD), which would define a three states equilibrium (Equation 6), does not improve the quality of the fit.IC′(collapsed)⇄U(extended)⇄Ic′′(collapsed)(Eq. 6) It has been shown that the presence of heme quenches TMR fluorescence of the protein (22Pletneva E.V. Gray H.B. Winkler J.R. Many faces of the unfolded state: Conformational heterogeneity in denatured yeast cytochrome c.J. Mol. Biol. 2005; 345: 855-867Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). The compact collapsed conformer (IC) is non-fluorescent because heme (the quencher) is close to the attached fluorophore (TMR) ensuring efficient quenching of TMR fluorescence. Alternatively, the extended conformer (U) is strongly fluorescent because heme (the quencher) and TMR (the fluorophore) are distant from each other. The parameter F, which corresponds to the population of the non-fluorescent conformer (see “Experimental Procedures”), would represent the population of IC (the compact conformer) in the equilibrium between U and IC. The time constant (τR) of the interconversion between U and IC has been found to be 50 μs. The population of IC increases with sodium perchlorate concentration as observed by a decrease in rH (Fig. 2a) and an increase in F (Fig. 2b). The decrease in rH with sodium perchlorate occurs in a single co-operative step that could be fit successfully using a two-state transition model, and the midpoint is 23 mm. The increase in F with the sodium perchlorate concentration occurs simultaneously (Fig. 2b), and a fit using the two state transition hypotheses leads to a midpoint of 20 mm. The presence of an equilibrium between an extended and a compact conformer in the unfolded state of cytochrome c has been shown before by fluorescence spectroscopy and small angle x-ray scattering experiments (14Haldar S.

Several control experiments have been carried out to establish that the parameter τR measures a true physical event and is not a fitting artifact. First, experiments have been carried out with TMR (the free dye) using the same setup and experimental conditions. Supplemental Fig. S2 shows the correlation functions obtained by the FCS experiments with TMR at pH 2. The data are fit successfully to Equation 1 and the use of τR is not needed. Second, FCS experiments have been carried out with cytochrome c-TMR using different laser power and pinhole diameters. The possibility of an artifactual extra component at large pinhole diameter has been reported previously (30Hess S.T. Webb W.W.

We see no systematic variation in the value of τR and F with the variation of laser power and pinhole diameters studied at pH 2 in the absence or presence of sodium perchlorate (supplemental Figs. S3 and S4). This experiment suggests that τR represents a true conformational event and not an erroneous component arising from the imperfect Gaussian approximation of the confocal volume element. In the third control experiment, we used cyanogen bromide-treated labeled cytochrome c-TMR as the control. Cyanogen bromide treatment with the protein yields a fragment with molecular weight of 3139 Da (as judged by mass spectrometry, supplemental Fig. S5). Although the fragment was still labeled with TMR, it did not contain the heme group as judged by absorption spectroscopy (supplemental Fig. S6). The absence of heme in the cyanogen bromide fragment resulted in a complete absence of fluorescence quenching observed in the full-length protein (supplemental Fig. S7 shows the fluorescence spectra of native and cyanogen bromide-treated fragment of cytochrome c with the same TMR concentration). Because the fragment lacks the non-fluorescent state and the parameter F in Equation 2 denotes the relative amplitude of the"

As one indirect effect, they can alter magnitude and direction of species interactions, for example those between hosts and parasites. We simulated a summer heat wave to investigate how a changing environment affects the interaction between the broad-nosed pipefish (Syngnathus typhle) as a host and its digenean trematode parasite (Cryptocotyle lingua). In a fully reciprocal laboratory infection experiment, pipefish from three different coastal locations were exposed to sympatric and allopatric trematode cercariae. In order to examine whether an extreme climatic event disrupts patterns of locally adapted host-parasite combinations we measured the parasite's transmission success as well as the host's adaptive and innate immune defence under control and heat wave conditions. Independent of temperature, sympatric cercariae were always more successful than allopatric ones, indicating that parasites are locally adapted to their hosts. Hosts suffered from heat stress as suggested by fewer cells of the adaptive immune system (lymphocytes) compared to the same groups that were kept at 18°C. However, the proportion of the innate immune cells (monocytes) was higher in the 18°C water. Contrary to our expectations, no interaction between host immune defence, parasite infectivity and temperature stress were found, nor did the pattern of local adaptation change due to increased water temperature. Thus, in this host-parasite interaction, the sympatric parasite keeps ahead of the coevolutionary dynamics across sites, even under increasing temperatures as expected under marine global warming."
https://openalex.org/W2046404571,"Plants of the genus Salvia produce various types of phenolic compounds and tanshinones which are effective for treatment of coronary heart disease. Salvia miltiorrhiza and S. castanea Diels f. tomentosa Stib are two important members of the genus. In this study, metabolic profiles and cDNA-AFLP analysis of four samples were employed to identify novel genes potentially involved in phenolic compounds and tanshinones biosynthesis, including the red roots from the two species and two tanshinone-free roots from S. miltiorrhiza. The results showed that the red roots of S. castanea Diels f. tomentosa Stib produced high contents of rosmarinic acid (21.77 mg/g) and tanshinone IIA (12.60 mg/g), but low content of salvianolic acid B (1.45 mg/g). The red roots of S. miltiorrhiza produced high content of salvianolic acid B (18.69 mg/g), while tanshinones accumulation in this sample was much less than that in S. castanea Diels f. tomentosa Stib. Tanshinones were not detected in the two tanshinone-free samples, which produced high contents of phenolic compounds. A cDNA-AFLP analysis with 128 primer pairs revealed that 2300 transcript derived fragments (TDFs) were differentially expressed among the four samples. About 323 TDFs were sequenced, of which 78 TDFs were annotated with known functions through BLASTX searching the Genbank database and 14 annotated TDFs were assigned into secondary metabolic pathways through searching the KEGGPATHWAY database. The quantitative real-time PCR analysis indicated that the expression of 9 TDFs was positively correlated with accumulation of phenolic compounds and tanshinones. These TDFs additionally showed coordinated transcriptional response with 6 previously-identified genes involved in biosynthesis of tanshinones and phenolic compounds in S. miltiorrhiza hairy roots treated with yeast extract. The sequence data in the present work not only provided us candidate genes involved in phenolic compounds and tanshinones biosynthesis but also gave us further insight into secondary metabolism in Salvia."
https://openalex.org/W2041640802,"The Wnt/β-catenin pathway controls cell proliferation, death and differentiation. Several families of extracellular proteins can antagonize Wnt/β-catenin signaling, including the decoy receptors known as secreted frizzled related proteins (SFRPs), which have a cysteine-rich domain (CRD) structurally similar to the extracellular Wnt-binding domain of the frizzled receptors. SFRPs inhibit Wnt signaling by sequestering Wnts through the CRD or by forming inactive complexes with the frizzled receptors. Other endogenous molecules carrying frizzled CRDs inhibit Wnt signaling, such as V3Nter, which is proteolytically derived from the cell surface component collagen XVIII and contains a biologically active frizzled domain (FZC18) inhibiting in vivo cell proliferation and tumor growth in mice. We recently showed that FZC18 expressing cells deliver short-range signals to neighboring cells, decreasing their proliferation in vitro and in vivo through the Wnt/β-catenin signaling pathway. Here, using low concentrations of soluble FZC18 and Wnt3a, we show that they physically interact in a cell-free system. In addition, soluble FZC18 binds the frizzled 1 and 8 receptors' CRDs, reducing cell sensitivity to Wnt3a. Conversely, inhibition of Wnt/β-catenin signaling was partially rescued by the expression of full-length frizzled 1 and 8 receptors, but enhanced by the expression of a chimeric cell-membrane-tethered frizzled 8 CRD. Moreover, soluble, partially purified recombinant FZC18_CRD inhibited Wnt3a-induced β-catenin activation. Taken together, the data indicate that collagen XVIII-derived frizzled CRD shifts Wnt sensitivity of normal cells to a lower pitch and controls their growth."

Fis1 is a mitochondrial outer membrane protein that recruits the dynamin-related GTPase Dnm1 during the fission process. This recruitment occurs via Mdv1, which binds both Fis1 and Dnm1 and therefore functions as a molecular adaptor linking the two molecules. Mdv1 has a modular structure, consisting of an N-terminal extension that binds Fis1, a central coiled coil for dimerization, and a C-terminal WD40 repeat region that binds Dnm1. We have solved the crystal structure of a dimeric Mdv1-Fis1 complex that contains both the N-terminal extension and coiled-coil regions of Mdv1. Consistent with previous studies, Mdv1 binds Fis1 through a U-shaped helix-loop-helix motif, and dimerization of the Mdv1-Fis1 complex is mediated by the antiparallel coiled coil of Mdv1. However, the complex is surprisingly compact and rigid due to two additional contacts mediated by the surface of the Mdv1 coiled coil. The coiled coil packs against both Fis1 and the second helix of the Mdv1 helix-loop-helix motif. Mutational analyses showed that these contacts are important for mitochondrial fission activity. These results indicate that, in addition to dimerization, the unusually long Mdv1 coiled coil serves a scaffolding function to stabilize the Mdv1-Fis1 complex.

The automated CAGE cDNA preparation system we present here can prepare 96 'HeliScope ready' CAGE cDNA libraries in 8 days, as opposed to 6 weeks by a manual operator.We compare the results obtained using the same RNA in manual libraries and across multiple automation batches to assess reproducibility.We show that the sequencing was highly reproducible and comparable to manual libraries with an 8 fold increase in productivity. The automated CAGE cDNA preparation system can prepare 96 CAGE sequencing samples simultaneously. Finally we discuss how the system could be used for CAGE on Illumina/SOLiD platforms, RNA-seq and full-length cDNA generation."
https://openalex.org/W2074018752,"To date, oxidized glycerophosphocholines (Ox-GPCs) with platelet-activating factor (PAF) activity produced non-enzymatically have not been definitively demonstrated to mediate any known disease processes. Here we provide evidence that these Ox-GPCs play a pivotal role in the photosensitivity associated with the deficiency of the DNA repair protein xeroderma pigmentosum type A (XPA). It should be noted that XPA-deficient cells are known to have decreased antioxidant defenses. These studies demonstrate that treatment of human XPA-deficient fibroblasts with the pro-oxidative stressor ultraviolet B (UVB) radiation resulted in increased reactive oxygen species and PAF receptor (PAF-R) agonistic activity in comparison with gene-corrected cells. The UVB irradiation-generated PAF-R agonists were inhibited by antioxidants. UVB irradiation of XPA-deficient (Xpa-/-) mice also resulted in increased PAF-R agonistic activity and skin inflammation in comparison with control mice. The increased UVB irradiation-mediated skin inflammation and TNF-α production in Xpa-/- mice were blocked by systemic antioxidants and by PAF-R antagonists. Structural characterization of PAF-R-stimulating activity in UVB-irradiated XPA-deficient fibroblasts using mass spectrometry revealed increased levels of sn-2 short-chain Ox-GPCs along with native PAF. These studies support a critical role for PAF-R agonistic Ox-GPCs in the pathophysiology of XPA photosensitivity."
https://openalex.org/W1996748207,"The mitogen-activated protein kinases (MAPK) ERK1 and ERK2 are among the major signal transduction molecules but little is known about their specific functions in vivo. ERK activity is provided by two isoforms, ERK1 and ERK2, which are ubiquitously expressed and share activators and substrates. However, there are not in vivo studies which have reported a role for ERK1 or ERK2 in HSCs and the bone marrow microenvironment. The present study shows that the ERK1-deficient mice present a mild osteopetrosis phenotype. The lodging and the homing abilities of the ERK1−/− HSC are impaired, suggesting that the ERK1−/−-defective environment may affect the engrafment of HSCs. Serial transplantations demonstrate that ERK1 is involved in the maintenance of an appropriate medullar microenvironment, but that the intrinsic properties of HSCs are not altered by the ERK1−/− defective microenvironment. Deletion of ERK1 impaired in vitro and in vivo osteoclastogenesis while osteoblasts were unaffected. As osteoclasts derive from precursors of the monocyte/macrophage lineage, investigation of the monocytic compartment was performed. In vivo analysis of the myeloid lineage progenitors revealed that the frequency of CMPs increased by approximately 1.3-fold, while the frequency of GMPs significantly decreased by almost 2-fold, compared with the respective WT compartments. The overall mononuclear-phagocyte lineage development was compromised in these mice due to a reduced expression of the M-CSF receptor on myeloid progenitors. These results show that the cellular targets of ERK1 are M-CSFR-responsive cells, upstream to osteoclasts. While ERK1 is well known to be activated by M-CSF, the present results are the first to point out an ERK1-dependent M-CSFR regulation on hematopoietic progenitors. This study reinforces the hypothesis of an active cross-talk between HSCs, their progeny and bone cells in the maintenance of the homeostasis of these compartments."
https://openalex.org/W1994166077,"The mechanism by which inclusion bodies form is still not well understood, partly because the dynamic processes of the inclusion body formation and its solubilization have hardly been investigated at an individual cell level, and so the important detailed information has not been acquired for the mechanism. In this study, we investigated the in vivo folding and aggregation of Aspergillus phoenicis β-D-galactosidase fused to a red fluorescence protein in individual Escherichia coli cells. The folding status and expression level of the recombinant β-D-galactosidase at an individual cell level was analyzed by flow cytometry in combination with transmission electron microscopy and Western blotting. We found that individual E. coli cells fell into two distinct states, one containing only inclusion bodies accompanied with low galactosidase activity and the other containing the recombinant soluble galactosidase accompanied with high galactosidase activity. The majority of the E. coli cells in the later state possessed no inclusion bodies. The two states of the cells were shifted to a cell state with high enzyme activity by culturing the cells in isopropyl 1-thio-β-D-galactopyranoside-free medium after an initial protein expression induction in isopropyl 1-thio-β-D-galactopyranoside-containing medium. This shift of the cell population status took place without the level change of the β-D-galactosidase protein in individual cells, indicating that the factor(s) besides the crowdedness of the recombinant protein play a major role in the cell state transition. These results shed new light on the mechanism of inclusion body formation and will facilitate the development of new strategies in improving recombinant protein quality."

https://openalex.org/W2021904716,"The coverage and reliability of protein-protein interactions determined by high-throughput experiments still needs to be improved, especially for higher organisms, therefore the question persists, how interactions can be verified and predicted by computational approaches using available data on protein structural complexes. Recently we developed an approach called IBIS (Inferred Biomolecular Interaction Server) to predict and annotate protein-protein binding sites and interaction partners, which is based on the assumption that the structural location and sequence patterns of protein-protein binding sites are conserved between close homologs. In this study first we confirmed high accuracy of our method and found that its accuracy depends critically on the usage of all available data on structures of homologous complexes, compared to the approaches where only a non-redundant set of complexes is employed. Second we showed that there exists a trade-off between specificity and sensitivity if we employ in the prediction only evolutionarily conserved binding site clusters or clusters supported by only one observation (singletons). Finally we addressed the question of identifying the biologically relevant interactions using the homology inference approach and demonstrated that a large majority of crystal packing interactions can be correctly identified and filtered by our algorithm. At the same time, about half of biological interfaces that are not present in the protein crystallographic asymmetric unit can be reconstructed by IBIS from homologous complexes without the prior knowledge of crystal parameters of the query protein."

Despite growing resistance chloroquine (CQ) remained until recently the official first-line treatment for falciparum malaria in Pakistan, with sulfadoxine-pyrimethamine (SP) second-line. Co-treatment with the gametocytocidal primaquine (PQ) is recommended for transmission control in South Asia. The relative effect of artesunate (AS) or primaquine, as partner drugs, on clinical outcomes and gametocyte carriage in this setting were unknown.A single-blinded, randomized trial among Afghan refugees in Pakistan compared six treatment arms: CQ; CQ+(single-dose)PQ; CQ+(3 d)AS; SP; SP+(single-dose)PQ, and SP+(3 d)AS. The objectives were to compare treatment failure rates and effect on gametocyte carriage, of CQ or SP monotherapy against the respective combinations (PQ or AS). Outcomes included trophozoite and gametocyte clearance (read by light microscopy), and clinical and parasitological failure.A total of 308 (87%) patients completed the trial. Failure rates by day 28 were: CQ 55/68 (81%); CQ+AS 19/67 (28%), SP 4/41 (9.8%), SP+AS 1/41 (2.4%). The addition of PQ to CQ or SP did not affect failure rates (CQ+PQ 49/67 (73%) failed; SP+PQ 5/33 (16%) failed). AS was superior to PQ at clearing gametocytes; gametocytes were seen on d7 in 85% of CQ, 40% of CQ+PQ, 21% of CQ+AS, 91% of SP, 76% of SP+PQ and 23% of SP+AS treated patients. PQ was more effective at clearing older gametocyte infections whereas AS was more effective at preventing emergence of mature gametocytes, except in cases that recrudesced.CQ is no longer appropriate by itself or in combination. These findings influenced the replacement of CQ with SP+AS for first-line treatment of uncomplicated falciparum malaria in the WHO Eastern Mediterranean Region. The threat of SP resistance remains as SP monotherapy is still common. Three day AS was superior to single-dose PQ for reducing gametocyte carriage.ClinicalTrials.gov NCT00959517."
https://openalex.org/W1971307043,"Cyclolipopeptides (CLPs) are biosurfactants produced by numerous Pseudomonas fluorescens strains. CLP production is known to be regulated at least by the GacA/GacS two-component pathway, but the full regulatory network is yet largely unknown. In the clinical strain MFN1032, CLP production is abolished by a mutation in the phospholipase C gene () and not restored by complementation. Their production is also subject to phenotypic variation. We used a modelling approach with Boolean networks, which takes into account all these observations concerning CLP production without any assumption on the topology of the considered network. Intensive computation yielded numerous models that satisfy these properties. All models minimizing the number of components point to a bistability in CLP production, which requires the presence of a yet unknown key self-inducible regulator. Furthermore, all suggest that a set of yet unexplained phenotypic variants might also be due to this epigenetic switch. The simplest of these Boolean networks was used to propose a biological regulatory network for CLP production. This modelling approach has allowed a possible regulation to be unravelled and an unusual behaviour of CLP production in P. fluorescens to be explained."
https://openalex.org/W2107946512,"Wnt signaling is crucial for a variety of biological processes, including body axis formation, planar polarity, stem cell maintenance and cellular differentiation. Therefore, targeted manipulation of Wnt signaling in vivo would be extremely useful. By applying chemical inducer of dimerization (CID) technology, we were able to modify the Wnt co-receptor, low-density lipoprotein (LDL)-receptor-related protein 5 (LRP5), to generate the synthetic ligand inducible Wnt switch, iLRP5. We show that iLRP5 oligomerization results in its localization to disheveled-containing punctate structures and sequestration of scaffold protein Axin, leading to robust β-catenin-mediated signaling. Moreover, we identify a novel LRP5 cytoplasmic domain critical for its intracellular localization and casein kinase 1-dependent β-catenin signaling. Finally, by utilizing iLRP5 as a Wnt signaling switch, we generated the Ubiquitous Activator of β-catenin (Ubi-Cat) transgenic mouse line. The Ubi-Cat line allows for nearly ubiquitous expression of iLRP5 under control of the H-2K(b) promoter. Activation of iLRP5 in isolated prostate basal epithelial stem cells resulted in expansion of p63(+) cells and development of hyperplasia in reconstituted murine prostate grafts. Independently, iLRP5 induction in adult prostate stroma enhanced prostate tissue regeneration. Moreover, induction of iLRP5 in male Ubi-Cat mice resulted in prostate tumor progression over several months from prostate hyperplasia to adenocarcinoma. We also investigated iLRP5 activation in Ubi-Cat-derived mammary cells, observing that prolonged activation results in mammary tumor formation. Thus, in two distinct experimental mouse models, activation of iLRP5 results in disruption of tissue homeostasis, demonstrating the utility of iLRP5 as a novel research tool for determining the outcome of Wnt activation in a precise spatially and temporally determined fashion."
https://openalex.org/W2018595121,"GABAergic signaling is essential for proper respiratory function. Potentiation of this signaling with allosteric modulators such as anesthetics, barbiturates, and neurosteroids can lead to respiratory arrest. Paradoxically, pregnant animals continue to breathe normally despite nearly 100-fold increases in circulating neurosteroids. ε subunit-containing GABA(A)Rs are insensitive to positive allosteric modulation, thus we hypothesized that pregnant rats increase ε subunit-containing GABA(A)R expression on brainstem neurons of the ventral respiratory column (VRC). In vivo, pregnancy rendered respiratory motor output insensitive to otherwise lethal doses of pentobarbital, a barbiturate previously used to categorize the ε subunit. Using electrode array recordings in vitro, we demonstrated that putative respiratory neurons of the preBötzinger Complex (preBötC) were also rendered insensitive to the effects of pentobarbital during pregnancy, but unit activity in the VRC was rapidly inhibited by the GABA(A)R agonist, muscimol. VRC unit activity from virgin and post-partum females was potently inhibited by both pentobarbital and muscimol. Brainstem ε subunit mRNA and protein levels were increased in pregnant rats, and GABA(A)R ε subunit expression co-localized with a marker of rhythm generating neurons (neurokinin 1 receptors) in the preBötC. These data support the hypothesis that pregnancy renders respiratory motor output and respiratory neuron activity insensitive to barbiturates, most likely via increased ε subunit-containing GABA(A)R expression on respiratory rhythm-generating neurons. Increased ε subunit expression may be critical to preserve respiratory function (and life) despite increased neurosteroid levels during pregnancy."
https://openalex.org/W1969052798,"Background The assessment of anticancer agents to treat leukemia needs to have animal models closer to the human pathology such as implantation in immunodeficient mice of leukemic cells from patient samples. A sensitive and early detection of tumor cells in these orthotopic models is a prerequisite for monitoring engraftment of leukemic cells and their dissemination in mice. Therefore, we developed a fluorescent antibody based strategy to detect leukemic foci in mice bearing patient-derived leukemic cells using fluorescence reflectance imaging (FRI) to determine when to start treatments with novel antitumor agents. Methods Two mAbs against the CD44 human myeloid marker or the CD45 human leukocyte marker were labeled with Alexa Fluor 750 and administered to leukemia-bearing mice after having verified the immunoreactivity in vitro. Bioluminescent leukemic cells (HL60-Luc) were used to compare the colocalization of the fluorescent mAb with these cells. The impact of the labeled antibodies on disease progression was further determined. Finally, the fluorescent hCD45 mAb was tested in mice engrafted with human leukemic cells. Results The probe labeling did not modify the immunoreactivity of the mAbs. There was a satisfactory correlation between bioluminescence imaging (BLI) and FRI and low doses of mAb were sufficient to detect leukemic foci. However, anti-hCD44 mAb had a strong impact on the tumor proliferation contrary to anti-hCD45 mAb. The use of anti-hCD45 mAb allowed the detection of leukemic patient cells engrafted onto NOD/SCID mice. Conclusions A mAb labeled with a near infrared fluorochrome is useful to detect leukemic foci in disseminated models provided that its potential impact on tumor proliferation has been thoroughly documented."

We describe QC and performance of two rapid tests, Determine™ and Uni-Gold™ used in a microbicide clinical trial in rural KwaZulu-Natal, South Africa. Methods/Results Internal QC of both HIV rapid tests was conducted at the trial site using a Uni-Gold control kit (Uni-Gold™Recombigen® HIV). Both assays produced the expected results for a total of 4637 QC tests. Study participants were tested for HIV at screening and, if enrolled, at regular time points throughout the study. Positive or discordant results were confirmed by a double HIV immunoassay testing strategy at a local laboratory. Overall, 15292 HIV rapid test were performed. Sensitivity and specificity of Determine was 98.95% (95% CI: 97.72–99.61) and 99.83% (95% CI: 99.70–99.91) respectively [positive predictive value (PPV) 97.91% (95% CI: 96.38–98.92)], for Uni-Gold it was 99.30% (95% CI: 98.21–99.81) and 99.96% (95% CI: 99.88–99.99) respectively [PPV 99.47% (95% CI: 98.46–99.89)]. Conclusions The results suggest that a Uni-Gold control kit can be used for internal QC of both Uni-Gold and the HIV-1 component of the Determine rapid tests. Both rapid tests performed proficiently in the trial population."
