Since phagocytizing polymorphonuclear leukocytes produce superoxide radicals, this reac-tion is sutggested and shown to be quantitatively feasible as the ini vivo mechanism of synovial fluid degradation in anl inflamed joint. Superoxide dismutase, and catalase protect synaovial fluid against such degradation in vitro."

https://openalex.org/W2004494479,Male Papilio glaucus butterflies are attracted to sand soaked with dillute aqueous solutions of sodium salts. A sodium ion concentration of 10(-3) molar is sufficient to stimulate puddling behavior. Acqlisition of sodiumn mnay be the main ecological function of pudding behavior.
https://openalex.org/W2103024955,"Under the influence of testosterone, the free-running circadian rhythm of locomotor activity of the starling, Sturnus vulgaris, tends to ""split"" into two components which temporarily run with different circadian frequencies: ""splitting"" occurred in intact birds whose testes grew, and in castrated birds that were injected with testosterone. Since ""splitting"" most probably reflects the temporal separation of two (or two groups of) circadian oscillators, these results suggest that testosterone affects the mutual coupling of circadian oscillators controlling locomotor activity."
https://openalex.org/W1987713079,"Basal bodies isolated from Chlamydomonas reinhardi will serve as initiation centers for the assembly of chick brain microtubule protein subunits (tubulin) into microtubules. The rate of microtubule assembly is tubulin-concentration dependent; this assembly occurs onto both distal and proximal ends of the basal body microtubules, with distal assembly greatly favored. In vitro assembly of brain tubulin also occurs onto the mid-lateral aspects of the basal bodies, presumably onto the fiber connecting the two basal bodies."
https://openalex.org/W2046959432,"IMMUNOGLOBULIN (Ig) molecules on the surface of B lymphocytes aggregate into a ‘cap’1 when the cell is treated with anti-Ig1–3. A similar process occurs with concanavalin A (con A) on neutrophil polymorphonuclear leukocytes (PMN)4. Capping occurs in two stages in both of these cell types4,5: first, the ligand-receptor complexes aggregate into multiple clusters of variable size, leaving intervening bare membrane; and second, the clusters are swept into a single mass. Both stages are temperature-dependent (that is, they do not occur in the cold), but only the latter is energy-dependent (that is, clustering occurs but capping is inhibited on cells treated with metabolic inhibitors)4–6. The formation of clusters can be attributed to the ability of the ligand to cross-link receptors5; some form of membrane activity then sweeps the clusters into the cap. Capping can occur in the absence of cell locomotion4,7, but if locomotion does occur the cap is found at the trailing end of the cell4. These aspects of capping have recently been analysed in detail4,7."

During this period, seven subjects showed behavioral alertness and increased CNV amplitude. Both groups of subjects showed heightened alertness 2 and 3 hours post-drug. Amphetamine is not a simple stimulant of the central nervous system but can also act as a depressant."

These compounds are the largest pheromones isolated thus far from a lepidopterous species. Sanninoidea exitiosa males did not respond to the synthesized (E,Z)-isomer, and low concentrations of it in the synthesized (Z,Z)-isomer did not interfere with their response to the (Z,Z)-isomer. In contrast, even very low concentrations of the (Z,Z)-isomer (1 percent) in the (E,Z)-isomer significantly inhibited the response of Synanthedon pictipes males."

https://openalex.org/W2022085797,A gonadotropin similar to human chorionic gonadotropin or luteinizing hormone has been demonstrated in rabbit blastocyst prior to implantation. The gonadotropin has been detected by a radioreceptor assay for human chorionic gonadotropin with the use of the plasma membranes of bovine corpora lutea obtained during the first trimester of pregnancy. The concentrations of the human chorionic gonadotropin or luteinizing hormone per milliliter of blastocyst fluid were tenfold higher than those in the blood of pregnant rabbits on days 5 and 6 after mating.

https://openalex.org/W2012575259,"A perchlorinated, cage-structured hydrocarbon, C10Cl12, also known as mirex or Dechlorane, has been identified in fish samples from the Bay of Quinte, Lake Ontario, Canada. The compound coelutes with polychlorinated biphenyls (PCB's) in residue cleanup procedures and under standard gas chromatographic conditions. Mirex has never been registered for use as an insecticide in Canada, nor does it appear to be in use in any area of the United States discharging water into Lake Ontario or its tributaries. It seems likely, therefore, that this compound is another widespread environmental contaminant of extremely high geochemical stability and as yet only superficially investigated biological activities. Under standard gas chromatographic conditions its peak is superimposed on that of the PCB's, and, as a result, the presence of mirex may have been unrecognized and it may therefore have been misinterpreted as a PCB isomer."

Identification of the structure of the regenerated material is based on comparisons of its x-ray diffractogram and its Raman spectrum with those of the native fiber, cellulose II, and cellulose IV."

Threshold injury resulted from single pulses with a mnean energy of 13 +/- 3 mnicrojoules. Electron microscopy of the retina revealed that damnage was highly localized in the photoreceptor and pigmented epithelial cells at the oluter retina. Membrane disruption, distorted outer segmtzents, and abnormnal melanin granules resembling fetal premelanosomnies were observed."

Only species with calcium-dependent serum precipitins to these fungi showed skin reactions. Immediate hypersensitivity in a nonreactive species could be induced after injection with serum from reactive species. The transferable serum factor (or factors) was heat sensitive.

The peak membrane potential of the spike correlates with the chloride ion concentration, but not with the calcium or sodium ion concentration. The chloride spike is blocked by manganese ion but not by cobalt ion."
https://openalex.org/W2064774476,"We describe an optical technique for measurement of mechanical vibrations in the auditory organs of living animals. The technique uses light scattered from the vibrating structure and offers several new advantages. Better than 1 angstrom sensitivity, 10 micrometers spatial resolution, and > 70 decibels dynamic range are achieved. Illustrative measurements of the mechanical response of the tympanic membrane of crickets (Gryllidae) are reported."
https://openalex.org/W2082662043,"A fish of the genus Eigenmannia responds differently to a neighboring conspecific fish with a slightly higher frequency of the electric organ discharge than its own than to one with a slightly lower such frequency than its own. When the two frequencies are beating against each other the special wave shape of the electric organ discharge leads to asymmetries of the beat pattern which are distinct for the two cases. Midbrain neurons, called ""deltaF recoders,"" sign and magnitude of the frequency difference on the basis of these patterns. that is, in the time rather than the frequency domain."

The molecule was characterized by (3l)P nuclear magnetic resonance, and its (31)P spectrum was simulated through the assumption of a three-phosphorus spin system. The molecule is highly reactive and is rapidly converted to adenosine triphosphate upon contact with water."

It has been known for more than 50 years that certain chemicals will blacken photographic plates (chemical fogging).

Examples are the plots of γ spectra, radiochromatograms and, most important, the data sheet that specifies such things as quality, purity and radiation intensity of the specific nuclide. Unfortunately, however, the controls used by suppliers are inadequate and the technical data sheet cannot be relied upon implicity."
