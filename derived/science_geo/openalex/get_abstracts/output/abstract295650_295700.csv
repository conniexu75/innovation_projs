https://openalex.org/W2000740358,"In September 1969, approximately 600 metric tons of number 2 fueloil were spilled in Buzzards Bay, Massachusetts. Two years later, fuel oil hydrocarbons still persisted in the marsh and in offshore sediments. Hydrocarbon degradation is slow, especially below the immediate sediment surface and appears to proceed principally through microbial utilization of alkanes and through partial dissolution of the lower-boiling aromatic hydrocarbons. The boiling range of the spilled oil and the relative abundances of homologous hydrocarbons (for example, phytane and pristane) have been well preserved. The findings are in agreement with the known geochemical stability of hydrocarbons. Fuel oil is an appreciable fraction of whole crude oil. This fact suggests that oil products and crude oils have a considerable environmental persistence."
https://openalex.org/W2022086310,"Experiments testing the effects of hydrodynamic processes and chemical cues on substrate selection were conducted with larvae of the marine tube worm Phragmatopoma lapidosa californica. In flume experiments, larvae were presented an array of sand treatments, including two substrates previously shown to induce metamorphosis in this species, under fast and slow flow regimes. Larvae preferentially metamorphosed on the inductive substrates in both flows. Delivery to the array was higher in fast flow because larvae tumbled along the bottom, whereas in slow flow, larvae were observed swimming in the water column. Thus, in addition to chemical cues, behavioral responses to flow conditions may play an important role in larval recruitment to the benthos."

https://openalex.org/W2067147063,"Chilean glaciers at a latitude of 41 degrees S reached a maximum extent about 19,400 carbon-14 years before the present (B. P.), shrank 50 percent by 16,000 years B. P., and readvanced to a smaller maximum after 14,800 years B. P. These fluctuations were closely in step with those of the Laurentide ice sheet east of the Mississippi River but differ somewhat from the accepted sequence in New Zealand. A corresponding pattern is not apparent in the Antarctic paleotemperature curve deduced from changes in oxygen isotope ratios."

https://openalex.org/W2036142209,"Experimental results concerning the ascent of sap in the xylem are usually interpreted in terms of gradients of hydrostatic pressure in the xylem conduits. In this report an alternative model is proposed that is equally consistent with the experimental results: under static conditions the water column is supported by a gradient in the chemical activity of the water, and the hydrostatic pressure is constant throughout. Observations that support the new model are cited, and experiments are suggested that would permit a choice between the two models."

https://openalex.org/W1977171273,"A small ice cap (covering about 12 square kilometers) and at least two-probably four-cirque glaciers (each covering less than 1 square kilometer) occurred on St. George Island, Pribilof Islands, probably during the Illinoian; Glaciation. Snowbanks persisted during a later cold cycle, probably during the Wisconsin Glaciation, with no glaciers existing. We found no evidence of glaciation on other Pribilof islands."

https://openalex.org/W2093249512,"Hordenine, anhalidine, pellotine, 3-demethyltrichocereine, mescaline, dimethoxy-beta-phenethylamine, and the N-monomethyl derivatives of mescaline d 3,4-dimethoxy-beta-phenethylamine have been isolated or identified, or both, in caloid extracts of a Mexican ""peyote"" cactus, Pelecyphora aselliformis tenberg. This is the first report of the occurrence of some of these alkaloids, including mescaline, in a North American cactus other than Lophophora."
