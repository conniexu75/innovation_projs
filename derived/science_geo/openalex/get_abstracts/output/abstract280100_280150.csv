https://openalex.org/W2134744478,"Shallow, seaward portions of modern coral reefs produce about 4 kilograms of calcium carbonate per square meter per year, and protected areas produce about 0.8 kilogram per square meter per year. The difference is probably largely a function of water motion. The more rapid rate, equivalent to a maximum vertical accretion of 3 to 5 millimeters per year, places an upper limit on the potential of modern coral reef communities to create a significant vertical structure on a rising sea."

https://openalex.org/W2014086107,Freeze-fracturing of untreated plasma membrane and inner wall surfaces of stelar tissue in corn roots demonstrated the association of globular complexes with the ends of nascent microfibrils. It is proposed that the granule complexes associated with the outer leaflet of the plasma membrane coordinate the assembly of the cellulosic microfibrils.

https://openalex.org/W2052541639,"An analysis of the weekly averages of diatom biomass measured near the coast of Southern California (32 degrees 50'N, 117 degrees 10'W) during the period from 1928 through 1939 indicates that three major blooms account for 85 percent of each year's diatom biomass. The average duration of a single bloom is 5.5 weeks. The diatom blooms coincide with upwelling, but their individual characteristics depend on the detailed features of the circulation patterns of the water masses. That is, if upwelling takes place after a large influx of subtropical or even tropical water because of the slackening California Current, the resulting diatom blooms are smaller by several orders of magnitude than those observed when the flow of the current is strong. This influx of subtropical water into the region is reflected in positive anomalies of temperature, salinity, and sea level."

Assuming an average particle density of 2.0 grams per cubic centimeter, concentrations of particles with diameters between 5 and 55 micrometers sampled on 11 different days averaged 31 micrograms per cubic meter upwind and 55 micrograms per cubic meter downwind of the city."
https://openalex.org/W2141298016,"On 26 January 1969 an Aerobee 350 rocket was fired from Wallops Island, Virginia, carrying an electron accelerator. Above 230 kilometers the electron guns put out a beam of 0.5 ampere of 10 kev electrons in pulses of 1-second duration aimed downward along the earth's magnetic field lines. The interaction of electron beam with the atmosphere at an altitude of about 100 kilometers generated enough light so that the auroral rays produced could be photographed on the ground by television camera systems."

A storage system capable of delivering the yearly average power output for about 10 hours already makes the dependability of the wind energy system comparable to that of a typical nuclear plant."

The unusual venation is reminiscent of family Stenoviciidae known from the Permian and Triassic of Eastern Australia and elsewhere. This first documented account of Paleozoic insects in Antarctica bears on drift questions."

https://openalex.org/W1975622971,The relation of the density of the lunar surface layer to depth is probably best determined from spacecraft measurements of the bearing capacity as a function of depth. A comparison of these values with laboratory measurements of the bearing capacity of low-cohesion particulate materials as a function of the percentage of solid indicates that the bulk density at the lunar surface is about 1.1 grams per cubic centimeter and that it increases nearly linearly to about 1.6 grams per cubic centimeter at a depth of 5 centimeters.
https://openalex.org/W2066751403,"A portion of basaltic glass retrieved from an abyssal hill in the northeast Pacific has been dated by the fission track method. The sample location corresponds to magnetic anomaly 10 believed to have resulted from sea-floor spreading. The age of this sample is 35 Â± 5 million years, which is in agreement with the previously proposed age of 31 to 32 million years based on linear extrapolation of measured recent spreading rates. This observation upholds the suggestions of other authors on the time variation of sea-floor spreading for the last 30 million years in various parts of the world ocean basin."

https://openalex.org/W1966653882,The inappropriate use of combinations of estrogen and progestagens to prevent miscarriages for pregnancy testing and for other complications of pregnancy is discussed. Physicians have continued to prescribe these drugs despite evidence that they may produce birth defects. It has been shown that the incidence of birth defects among women taking these drugs is 2-5 times higher than those who are untreated. In light of the preliminary evidence the Food and Drug Administration withdrew approval of the drugs for use during pregnancy. Early in 1975 a bulletin was mailed to physicians and other health professionals further warning them against the use of the drugs. However evidence obtained by the International Marketing Service of Ambler Pennsylvania indicates that in 1975 physicians wrote only about 10% less prescriptions for these drugs than when they were approved in 1972. Further regulations are being prepared concerning the hormones. Manufacturers will also be required to revise physician labeling for the hormones to incorporate a warning against use in early pregnancy.

https://openalex.org/W2048184603,The Ford Foundation Report Reproduction and Human Welfare which argues for renewed interest in and funding for birth control research is reviewed. The report reflects the work of more than 150 experts from 23 countries and contains 41 scientific essays. It traces the history of contraceptive research the explosion of interest from 1965 to 1974 the dropping off of support as problems of acceptance began to be experienced and details the need for more research dollars to investigate drug-containing implants antipregnancy vaccines and basic research to develop other possible contraceptives. Worldwide support for fertility research increased from $31 million in 1965 to $119 million in 1974 but $328 million is needed from the U.S. $162 million from other industrial nations and $7 million from developing nations to adequately fund research efforts. The report also encourages greater division of labor among scientists in developing and developed nations. To do this there will have to be greater international funding efforts.
