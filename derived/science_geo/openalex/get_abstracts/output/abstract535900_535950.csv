https://openalex.org/W2162682097,"Because of the generally lower activation energy associated with proton conduction in oxides compared to oxygen ion conduction, protonic ceramic fuel cells (PCFCs) should be able to operate at lower temperatures than solid oxide fuel cells (250° to 550°C versus ≥600°C) on hydrogen and hydrocarbon fuels if fabrication challenges and suitable cathodes can be developed. We fabricated the complete sandwich structure of PCFCs directly from raw precursor oxides with only one moderate-temperature processing step through the use of sintering agents such as copper oxide. We also developed a proton-, oxygen-ion-, and electron-hole-conducting PCFC-compatible cathode material, BaCo(0.4)Fe(0.4)Zr(0.1)Y(0.1)O(3-δ) (BCFZY0.1), that greatly improved oxygen reduction reaction kinetics at intermediate to low temperatures. We demonstrated high performance from five different types of PCFC button cells without degradation after 1400 hours. Power densities as high as 455 milliwatts per square centimeter at 500°C on H2 and 142 milliwatts per square centimeter on CH4 were achieved, and operation was possible even at 350°C."

https://openalex.org/W985591008,"Although periodontitis has been implicated as a risk factor for various systemic diseases, the precise mechanisms by which periodontitis induces systemic disease remain to be elucidated. We have previously revealed that repeated oral administration of Porphyromonas gingivalis elicits endotoxemia via changes in the gut microbiota of the ileum, and thereby induces systemic inflammation and insulin resistance. However, it is not clear to what extent a single administration of P. gingivalis could affect gut microbiota composition, gut barrier function, and subsequent influx of gut microbiota into the liver. Therefore, in the present study, C57BL/6 mice were orally administered P. gingivalis (strain W83) once and compared to sham-inoculated mice. The phylogenetic structure and diversity of microbial communities in the gut and liver were analyzed by pyrosequencing the 16S ribosomal RNA genes. Serum endotoxin activity was determined by a Limulus amebocyte lysate test. Gene expression in the intestine and expression of 16S rRNA genes in the blood and liver were examined by quantitative polymerase chain reaction. Administration of P. gingivalis significantly altered gut microbiota, with an increased proportion of phylum Bacteroidetes, a decreased proportion of phylum Firmicutes, and increased serum endotoxin levels. In the intestinal tissues, gene expression of tjp-1 and occludin, which are involved in intestinal permeability, were downregulated. Higher amounts of bacterial DNA were detected in the liver of infected mice. Importantly, changes in gut microbiota preceded systemic inflammatory changes. These results further support the idea that disturbance of the gut microbiota composition by orally derived periodontopathic bacteria may be a causal mechanism linking periodontitis and systemic disease."

In a study of the regulation of mitochondrial function, Aurelio Teleman and colleagues find that the fatty acid stearic acid (C18:0) and the protein transferrin receptor (TFR1) are both mitochondrial regulators. C18:0 acts by stearoylating TFR1, thereby inhibiting its activation of JNK signalling and promoting mitochondrial fusion and function. C18:0 is a dietary component and, intriguingly, animal cells respond to both increases and decreases in C18:0 levels. Dietary supplementation with C18:0 enhances mitochondrial fusion in Drosophila, counteracting the mitochondrial dysfunction caused by genetic defects such as the loss of the Parkinson's associated genes Pink and Parkin in models of the disease. Mitochondria are involved in a variety of cellular functions, including ATP production, amino acid and lipid biogenesis and breakdown, signalling and apoptosis1,2,3. Mitochondrial dysfunction has been linked to neurodegenerative diseases, cancer and ageing4. Although transcriptional mechanisms that regulate mitochondrial abundance are known5, comparatively little is known about how mitochondrial function is regulated. Here we identify the metabolite stearic acid (C18:0) and human transferrin receptor 1 (TFR1; also known as TFRC) as mitochondrial regulators. We elucidate a signalling pathway whereby C18:0 stearoylates TFR1, thereby inhibiting its activation of JNK signalling. This leads to reduced ubiquitination of mitofusin via HUWE1, thereby promoting mitochondrial fusion and function. We find that animal cells are poised to respond to both increases and decreases in C18:0 levels, with increased C18:0 dietary intake boosting mitochondrial fusion in vivo. Intriguingly, dietary C18:0 supplementation can counteract the mitochondrial dysfunction caused by genetic defects such as loss of the Parkinson’s disease genes Pink or Parkin in Drosophila. This work identifies the metabolite C18:0 as a signalling molecule regulating mitochondrial function in response to diet."
https://openalex.org/W1003766845,"This paper assesses the potentiality of certainty factor models (CF) for the best suitable causative factors extraction for landslide susceptibility mapping in the Sado Island, Niigata Prefecture, Japan. To test the applicability of CF, a landslide inventory map provided by National Research Institute for Earth Science and Disaster Prevention (NIED) was split into two subsets: (i) 70% of the landslides in the inventory to be used for building the CF based model; (ii) 30% of the landslides to be used for the validation purpose. A spatial database with fifteen landslide causative factors was then constructed by processing ALOS satellite images, aerial photos, topographical and geological maps. CF model was then applied to select the best subset from the fifteen factors. Using all fifteen factors and the best subset factors, landslide susceptibility maps were produced using statistical index (SI) and logistic regression (LR) models. The susceptibility maps were validated and compared using landslide locations in the validation data. The prediction performance of two susceptibility maps was estimated using the Receiver Operating Characteristics (ROC). The result shows that the area under the ROC curve (AUC) for the LR model (AUC = 0.817) is slightly higher than those obtained from the SI model (AUC = 0.801). Further, it is noted that the SI and LR models using the best subset outperform the models using the fifteen original factors. Therefore, we conclude that the optimized factor model using CF is more accurate in predicting landslide susceptibility and obtaining a more homogeneous classification map. Our findings acknowledge that in the mountainous regions suffering from data scarcity, it is possible to select key factors related to landslide occurrence based on the CF models in a GIS platform. Hence, the development of a scenario for future planning of risk mitigation is achieved in an efficient manner."
https://openalex.org/W1522056646,"Long-term therapies such as disease modifying therapy for Multiple Sclerosis (MS) demand high levels of medication adherence in order to reach acceptable outcomes. The objective of this study was to describe adherence to four disease modifying drugs (DMDs) among statutorily insured patients within two years following treatment initiation. These drugs were interferon beta-1a i.m. (Avonex), interferon beta-1a s.c. (Rebif), interferon beta-1b s.c. (Betaferon) and glatiramer acetate s.c. (Copaxone).This retrospective cohort study used pharmacy claims data from the data warehouse of the German Institute for Drug Use Evaluation (DAPI) from 2001 through 2009. New or renewed DMD prescriptions in the years 2002 to 2006 were identified and adherence was estimated during 730 days of follow-up by analyzing the medication possession ratio (MPR) as proxy for compliance and persistence defined as number of days from initiation of DMD therapy until discontinuation or interruption.A total of 52,516 medication profiles or therapy cycles (11,891 Avonex, 14,060 Betaferon, 12,353 Copaxone and 14,212 Rebif) from 50,057 patients were included into the analysis. Among the 4 cohorts, no clinically relevant differences were found in available covariates. The Medication Possession Ratio (MPR) measured overall compliance, which was 39.9% with a threshold MPR≥0.8. There were small differences in the proportion of therapy cycles during which a patient was compliant for the following medications: Avonex (42.8%), Betaferon (40.6%), Rebif (39.2%), and Copaxone (37%). Overall persistence was 32.3% at the end of the 24 months observation period, i.e. during only one third of all included therapy cycles patients did not discontinue or interrupt DMD therapy. There were also small differences in the proportion of therapy cycles during which a patient was persistent as follows: Avonex (34.2%), Betaferon (33.4%), Rebif (31.7%) and Copaxone (29.8%).Two years after initiating MS-modifying therapy, only 30-40% of patients were adherent to DMDs."
https://openalex.org/W1043625994,"During inflammation, dendritic cells emigrate from inflamed tissue across the lymphatic endothelium into the lymphatic vasculature and travel to regional lymph nodes to initiate immune responses. However, the processes that regulate dendritic cell tissue egress and migration across the lymphatic endothelium are not well defined. The mammalian lectin galectin-1 is highly expressed by vascular endothelial cells in inflamed tissue and has been shown to regulate immune cell tissue entry into inflamed tissue. Here, we show that galectin-1 is also highly expressed by human lymphatic endothelial cells, and deposition of galectin-1 in extracellular matrix selectively regulates migration of specific human dendritic cell subsets. The presence of galectin-1 inhibits migration of immunogenic dendritic cells through the extracellular matrix and across lymphatic endothelial cells, but it has no effect on migration of tolerogenic dendritic cells. The major galectin-1 counter-receptor on both dendritic cell populations is the cell surface mucin CD43; differential core 2 O-glycosylation of CD43 between immunogenic dendritic cells and tolerogenic dendritic cells appears to contribute to the differential effect of galectin-1 on migration. Binding of galectin-1 to immunogenic dendritic cells reduces phosphorylation and activity of the protein-tyrosine kinase Pyk2, an effect that may also contribute to reduced migration of this subset. In a murine lymphedema model, galectin-1−/− animals had increased numbers of migratory dendritic cells in draining lymph nodes, specifically dendritic cells with an immunogenic phenotype. These findings define a novel role for galectin-1 in inhibiting tissue emigration of immunogenic, but not tolerogenic, dendritic cells, providing an additional mechanism by which galectin-1 can dampen immune responses.

https://openalex.org/W2154081990,"Background The impact of adjuvant chemotherapy on breast cancer prognosis has been demonstrated in randomized trials, but its impact is unknown in real-world populations. The aim of this study was to evaluate the effect of adjuvant chemotherapy on the survival of breast cancer patients in an unselected population. Methods This prospective cohort study included 32,502 women treated at the Institut Curie between 1981 and 2008 for a first invasive breast cancer without metastasis. The patients were matched based on their propensity score to receive adjuvant chemotherapy. Results The matching generated a subsample of 9,180 patients with an overlapping propensity score. In the group without chemotherapy, the overall survival (OS) rates at 5 and 10 years of follow-up were 87.6% (95% CI [86.7–88.6]) and 75.0% (95% CI [73.6–76.5]), respectively, versus 92.1% (95% CI [91.3–92.9]) and 81.9% (95% CI [80.6–83.2]), respectively, in the chemotherapy group. Distant disease-free survival (DDFS) was significantly improved in the five first years (absolute benefit of 3.5%). In a multivariate analysis, adjuvant chemotherapy was associated with better OS (HR = 0.75, 95% CI [0.69–0.83], p<0.0001) and DDFS (HR = 0.82, 95% CI [0.75–0.90], p<0.0001). Conclusion Adjuvant chemotherapy significantly improves OS and DDFS rates in an unselected population, in accordance with previous results reported by randomized trials."
https://openalex.org/W1747137150,"Heart failure (HF) is an increasingly recognized complication of diabetes. Cardiac fibrosis is an important causative mechanism of HF associated with diabetes. Recent data indicate that inflammation may be particularly important in the pathogenesis of cardiovascular fibrosis. We sought to determine the mechanism by which cardiac fibrosis develops and to specifically investigate the role of the CXCR4 axis in this process. Animals with type I diabetes (streptozotocin treated mice) or type II diabetes (Israeli Sand-rats) and controls were randomized to treatment with a CXCR4 antagonist, candesartan or vehicle control. Additional groups of mice also underwent bone marrow transplantation (GFP+ donor marrow) to investigate the potential role of bone marrow derived cell mobilization in the pathogenesis of cardiac fibrosis. Both type I and II models of diabetes were accompanied by the development of significant cardiac fibrosis. CXCR4 antagonism markedly reduced cardiac fibrosis in both models of diabetes, similar in magnitude to that seen with candesartan. In contrast to candesartan, the anti-fibrotic actions of CXCR4 antagonism occurred in a blood pressure independent manner. Whilst the induction of diabetes did not increase the overall myocardial burden of GFP+ cells, it was accompanied by an increase in GFP+ cells expressing the fibroblast marker alpha-smooth muscle actin and this was attenuated by CXCR4 antagonism. CXCR4 antagonism was also accompanied by increased levels of circulating regulatory T cells. Taken together the current data indicate that pharmacological inhibition of CXCR4 significantly reduces diabetes induced cardiac fibrosis, providing a potentially important therapeutic approach."
https://openalex.org/W1943150785,"Keratocytes, the quiescent cells of the corneal stroma, play a crucial role in corneal wound healing. Neuropeptides and neurotransmitters are usually associated with neuronal signaling, but have recently been shown to be produced also by non-neuronal cells and to be involved in many cellular processes. The aim of this study was to assess the endogenous intracellular and secreted levels of the neuropeptides substance P (SP) and neurokinin A (NKA), and of the neurotransmitters acetylcholine (ACh), catecholamines (adrenaline, noradrenaline and dopamine), and glutamate, as well as the expression profiles of their receptors, in human primary keratocytes in vitro and in keratocytes of human corneal tissue sections in situ. Cultured keratocytes expressed genes encoding for SP and NKA, and for catecholamine and glutamate synthesizing enzymes, as well as genes for neuropeptide, adrenergic and ACh (muscarinic) receptors. Keratocytes in culture produced SP, NKA, catecholamines, ACh, and glutamate, and expressed neurokinin-1 and -2 receptors (NK-1R and NK-2R), dopamine receptor D2, muscarinic ACh receptors, and NDMAR1 glutamate receptor. Human corneal sections expressed SP, NKA, NK-1R, NK-2R, receptor D2, choline acetyl transferase (ChAT), M3, M4 and M5 muscarinic ACh receptors, glutamate, and NMDAR1, but not catecholamine synthesizing enzyme or the α1 and β2 adrenoreceptors, nor M1 receptor. In addition, expression profiles assumed significant differences between keratocytes from the peripheral cornea as compared to those from the central cornea, as well as differences between keratocytes cultured under various serum concentrations. In conclusion, human keratocytes express an array of neuropeptides and neurotransmitters. The cells furthermore express receptors for neuropeptides/neurotransmitters, which suggests that they are susceptible to stimulation by these substances in the cornea, whether of neuronal or non-neuronal origin. As it has been shown that neuropeptides/neurotransmitters are involved in cell proliferation, migration, and angiogenesis, it is possible that they play a role in corneal wound healing."
https://openalex.org/W2243692560,"The Ras-like small GTPases RalA and RalB are well validated effectors of RAS oncogene-driven human cancer growth, and pharmacologic inhibitors of Ral function may provide an effective anti-Ras therapeutic strategy. Intriguingly, although RalA and RalB share strong overall amino acid sequence identity, exhibit essentially identical structural and biochemical properties, and can utilize the same downstream effectors, they also exhibit divergent and sometimes opposing roles in the tumorigenic and metastatic growth of different cancer types. These distinct biological functions have been attributed largely to sequence divergence in their carboxyl-terminal hypervariable regions. However, the role of posttranslational modifications signaled by the hypervariable region carboxyl-terminal tetrapeptide CAAX motif (C = cysteine, A = aliphatic amino acid, X = terminal residue) in Ral isoform-selective functions has not been addressed. We determined that these modifications have distinct roles and consequences. Both RalA and RalB require Ras converting CAAX endopeptidase 1 (RCE1) for association with the plasma membrane, albeit not with endomembranes, and loss of RCE1 caused mislocalization as well as sustained activation of both RalA and RalB. In contrast, isoprenylcysteine carboxylmethyltransferase (ICMT) deficiency disrupted plasma membrane localization only of RalB, whereas RalA depended on ICMT for efficient endosomal localization. Furthermore, the absence of ICMT increased stability of RalB but not RalA protein. Finally, palmitoylation was critical for subcellular localization of RalB but not RalA. In summary, we have identified striking isoform-specific consequences of distinct CAAX-signaled posttranslational modifications that contribute to the divergent subcellular localization and activity of RalA and RalB.

https://openalex.org/W2161470650,"In several clinical and experimental studies IL-33 and its receptor have been found to play important roles in the development of asthma and allergic airway inflammation. We evaluated the effects of vaccination against IL-33 in a mouse model of airway inflammation induced by house dust mite (HDM) allergen. Balb/c mice received the IL-33 vaccine subcutaneously, followed by intranasal administration of HDM for up to six weeks. Vaccination against IL-33 induced high titers of specific anti-IL-33 IgG antibodies that inhibited HDM-induced airway hyperresponsiveness (AHR) in the conducting airways and tissue damping. The vaccination also attenuated the HDM-induced elevation in the numbers of eosinophils in bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF) and suppressed the accumulation of inflammatory cells in the airways. Furthermore, the levels of IL-17A, IL-25, IL-33 and TSLP in lung tissue homogenates were reduced by vaccination against IL-33. These observations demonstrate that vaccination against IL-33 inhibits HDM-induced development of AHR, airway inflammation and production of inflammatory cytokines. The results also indicate an important role of IL-33 in the regulation of AHR of the distal lung compartments. Thus, administration of such a vaccine is potentially an effective therapeutic tool for treating allergic asthma."

https://openalex.org/W950283202,"In epidemiological studies, it is important to identify independent associations between collective exposures and a health outcome. The current stepwise selection technique ignores stochastic errors and suffers from a lack of stability. The alternative LASSO-penalized regression model can be applied to detect significant predictors from a pool of candidate variables. However, this technique is prone to false positives and tends to create excessive biases. It remains challenging to develop robust variable selection methods and enhance predictability.Two improved algorithms denoted the two-stage hybrid and bootstrap ranking procedures, both using a LASSO-type penalty, were developed for epidemiological association analysis. The performance of the proposed procedures and other methods including conventional LASSO, Bolasso, stepwise and stability selection models were evaluated using intensive simulation. In addition, methods were compared by using an empirical analysis based on large-scale survey data of hepatitis B infection-relevant factors among Guangdong residents.The proposed procedures produced comparable or less biased selection results when compared to conventional variable selection models. In total, the two newly proposed procedures were stable with respect to various scenarios of simulation, demonstrating a higher power and a lower false positive rate during variable selection than the compared methods. In empirical analysis, the proposed procedures yielding a sparse set of hepatitis B infection-relevant factors gave the best predictive performance and showed that the procedures were able to select a more stringent set of factors. The individual history of hepatitis B vaccination, family and individual history of hepatitis B infection were associated with hepatitis B infection in the studied residents according to the proposed procedures.The newly proposed procedures improve the identification of significant variables and enable us to derive a new insight into epidemiological association analysis."
https://openalex.org/W1895071906,"Many surface proteins thought to promote Streptocococcus pneumoniae virulence have recently been discovered and are currently being considered as future vaccine targets. We assessed the prevalence of 16 virulence genes among 435 S. pneumoniae invasive isolates from France and the ""African meningitis belt"" region, with particular focus on serotype 1 (Sp1), to compare their geographical distribution, assess their association with site of infection and evaluate their potential interest as new vaccine candidates.Detection by PCR of pspA (+families), pspC (+pspC.4), pavA, lytA, phtA,B,D,E, nanA,B,C, rrgA (Pilus-1), sipA (Pilus-2), pcpA and psrp was performed on all isolates, as well as antibiotic resistance testing and MLVA typing (+MLST on 54 representative strains). Determination of ply alleles was performed by sequencing (Sp1 isolates).MLVA and virulence genes profiles segregated Sp1 isolates into 2 groups that followed continent distribution. The ply allele 5 and most of the genes that were variable (nanC, Pilus-2, psrp, pcpA, phtD) were present in the French Sp1 isolates (PMEN clone Sweden(1)-28, ST306) but absent from the African ones. Whereas all African Sp1 isolates clustered into a single MLST CC (CC217), MLVA distinguished two CCs that followed temporal evolution. Pilus-2 and psrp were more prevalent in bacteraemic pneumonia yielded isolates and phtB in meningitis-related isolates. Considering vaccine candidates, phtD was less prevalent than anticipated (50%) and pcpA varied importantly between France and Africa (98% versus 34%). Pilus-1 was carried by 7-11% of isolates and associated with β-lactams resistance.Most virulence genes were carried by the European ST306 clone but were lacking on Sp1 isolates circulating in the African meningitis belt, where a more serious pattern of infection is observed. While virulence proteins are now considered as vaccine targets, the geographical differences in their prevalence could affect the efficacy expected from future vaccines."
https://openalex.org/W1001729783,"Structural biology has recently documented the conformational plasticity of the trypsin fold for both the protease and zymogen in terms of a pre-existing equilibrium between closed (E*) and open (E) forms of the active site region. How such plasticity is manifested in solution and affects ligand recognition by the protease and zymogen is poorly understood in quantitative terms. Here we dissect the E*-E equilibrium with stopped-flow kinetics in the presence of excess ligand or macromolecule. Using the clotting protease thrombin and its zymogen precursor prethrombin-2 as relevant models we resolve the relative distribution of the E* and E forms and the underlying kinetic rates for their interconversion. In the case of thrombin, the E* and E forms are distributed in a 1:4 ratio and interconvert on a time scale of 45 ms. In the case of prethrombin-2, the equilibrium is shifted strongly (10:1 ratio) in favor of the closed E* form and unfolds over a faster time scale of 4.5 ms. The distribution of E* and E forms observed for thrombin and prethrombin-2 indicates that zymogen activation is linked to a significant shift in the pre-existing equilibrium between closed and open conformations that facilitates ligand binding to the active site. These findings broaden our mechanistic understanding of how conformational transitions control ligand recognition by thrombin and its zymogen precursor prethrombin-2 and have direct relevance to other members of the trypsin fold."
https://openalex.org/W1538512608,"Similar environmental driving forces can produce similarity among geographically distant ecosystems. Coastal oceanic upwelling, for example, has been associated with elevated biomass and abundance patterns of certain functional groups, e.g., corticated macroalgae. In the upwelling system of Northern Chile, we examined measures of intertidal macrobenthic composition, structure and trophic ecology across eighteen shores varying in their proximity to two coastal upwelling centres, in a hierarchical sampling design (spatial scales of >1 and >10 km). The influence of coastal upwelling on intertidal communities was confirmed by the stable isotope values (δ13C and δ15N) of consumers, including a dominant suspension feeder, grazers, and their putative resources of POM, epilithic biofilm, and macroalgae. We highlight the utility of muscle δ15N from the suspension feeding mussel, Perumytilus purpuratus, as a proxy for upwelling, supported by satellite data and previous studies. Where possible, we used corrections for broader-scale trends, spatial autocorrelation, ontogenetic dietary shifts and spatial baseline isotopic variation prior to analysis. Our results showed macroalgal assemblage composition, and benthic consumer assemblage structure, varied significantly with the intertidal influence of coastal upwelling, especially contrasting bays and coastal headlands. Coastal topography also separated differences in consumer resource use. This suggested that coastal upwelling, itself driven by coastline topography, influences intertidal communities by advecting nearshore phytoplankton populations offshore and cooling coastal water temperatures. We recommend the isotopic values of benthic organisms, specifically long-lived suspension feeders, as in situ alternatives to offshore measurements of upwelling influence."
https://openalex.org/W1761708297,"To investigate the cost-effectiveness of screening and subsequent intervention for age-related macular degeneration (AMD) in Japan.The clinical effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of screening and subsequent intervention for AMD were assessed using a Markov model. The Markov model simulation began at the age of 40 years and concluded at the age of 90 years. The first-eye and second-eye combined model assumed an annual state-transition probability, development of prodromal symptoms, choroidal neovascularization (CNV), and reduction in visual acuity. Anti-vascular-endothelial-growth-factor (anti-VEGF) intravitreal injection therapy and photodynamic therapy (PDT) were performed to treat CNV. Intake of supplements was recommended to patients who had prodromal symptoms and unilateral AMD. Data on prevalence, morbidity, transition probability, utility value of each AMD patient, and treatment costs were obtained from published clinical reports.In the base-case analysis, screening for AMD every 5 years, beginning at the age of 50 years, showed a decrease of 41% in the total number of blind patients. The screening program reduced the incidence of blindness more than did the additional intake of supplements. However, the incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) of screening versus no screening was 27,486,352 Japanese yen (JPY), or 259,942 US dollars (USD) per quality-adjusted life year (QALY). In the sensitivity analysis, prodromal symptom-related factors for AMD had great impacts on the cost-effectiveness of screening. The lowest ICER obtained from the best scenario was 4,913,717 JPY (46,470 USD) per QALY, which was approximately equal to the willingness to pay in Japan.Ophthalmologic screening for AMD in adults is highly effective in reducing the number of patients with blindness but not cost-effective as demonstrated by a Markov model based on clinical data from Japan."
https://openalex.org/W1727087060,"Social justice concerns but also perceived business advantage are behind a widespread drive to increase workplace diversity. However, dominance in terms of ethnicity, gender or other aspects of diversity has been resistant to change in many sectors. The different factors which contribute to low diversity are often hotly contested and difficult to untangle. We propose that many of the barriers to change arise from self-reinforcing feedbacks between low group diversity and inclusivity. Using a dynamic model, we demonstrate how bias in employee appointment and departure can trap organizations in a state with much lower diversity than the applicant pool: a workforce diversity ""poverty trap"". Our results also illustrate that if turnover rate is low, employee diversity takes a very long time to change, even in the absence of any bias. The predicted rate of change in workforce composition depends on the rate at which employees enter and leave the organization, and on three measures of inclusion: applicant diversity, appointment bias and departure bias. Quantifying these three inclusion measures is the basis of a new, practical framework to identify barriers and opportunities to increasing workforce diversity. Because we used a systems approach to investigate underlying feedback mechanisms rather than context-specific causes of low workforce diversity, our results are applicable across a wide range of settings."

In aquatic systems, for example, reductions in water clarity can limit the light available for photosynthesis, with knock-on consequences for secondary consumers, though in naturally turbid wave-swept estuaries, detecting the effects of elevated turbidity can be difficult. The objective of this study was to investigate the effects of shading on ecosystem functions mediated by sandflat primary producers (microphytobenthos) and deep-dwelling surface-feeding macrofauna (Macomona liliana; Bivalvia, Veneroida, Tellinidae). Shade cloths (which reduced incident light intensity by ~80%) were deployed on an exposed, intertidal sandflat to experimentally stress the microphytobenthic community associated with the sediment surface. After 13 weeks, sediment properties, macrofauna and fluxes of oxygen and inorganic nutrients across the sediment-water interface were measured. A multivariate metric of ecosystem function (MF) was generated by combining flux-based response variables, and distance-based linear models were used to determine shifts in the drivers of ecosystem function between non-shaded and shaded plots. No significant differences in MF or in the constituent ecosystem function variables were detected between the shaded and non-shaded plots. However, shading reduced the total explained variation in MF (from 64% in non-shaded plots to 15% in shaded plots) and affected the relative influence of M. liliana and other explanatory variables on MF. This suggests that although shade stress may shift the drivers of ecosystem functioning (consistent with earlier investigations of shading effects on sandflat interaction networks), ecosystem functions appear to have a degree of resilience to those changes."
https://openalex.org/W1638473988,"Self-report is the most common and feasible method for assessing patient adherence to medication, but can be prone to recall bias and social desirability bias. Most studies assessing adherence to artemisinin-based combination therapies (ACTs) have relied on self-report. In this study, we use a novel customised electronic monitoring device--termed smart blister packs--to examine the validity of self-reported adherence to artemether-lumefantrine (AL) in southern Tanzania.Smart blister packs were designed to look identical to locally available AL blister packs and to record the date and time each tablet was removed from packaging. Patients obtaining AL at randomly selected health facilities and drug stores were followed up at home three days later and interviewed about each dose of AL taken. Blister packs were requested for pill count and extraction of smart blister pack data.Data on adherence from both self-report verified by pill count and smart blister packs were available for 696 of 1,204 patients. There was no difference between methods in the proportion of patients assessed to have completed treatment (64% and 67%, respectively). However, the percentage taking the correct number of pills for each dose at the correct times (timely completion) was higher by self-report than smart blister packs (37% vs. 24%; p<0.0001). By smart blister packs, 64% of patients completing treatment did not take the correct number of pills per dose or did not take each dose at the correct time interval.Smart blister packs resulted in lower estimates of timely completion of AL and may be less prone to recall and social desirability bias. They may be useful when data on patterns of adherence are desirable to evaluate treatment outcomes. Improved methods of collecting self-reported data are needed to minimise bias and maximise comparability between studies."
https://openalex.org/W1854239124,"Patient-derived cancer xenografts (PDCX) generally represent more reliable models of human disease in which to evaluate a potential drugs preclinical efficacy. However to date, only a few patient-derived gastric cancer xenograft (PDGCX) models have been reported. In this study, we aimed to establish additional PDGCX models and to evaluate whether these models accurately reflected the histological and genetic diversities of the corresponding patient tumors. By engrafting fresh patient gastric cancer (GC) tissues into immune-compromised mice (SCID and/or nude mice), thirty two PDGCX models were established. Histological features were assessed by a qualified pathologist based on H&E staining. Genomic comparison was performed for several biomarkers including ERBB1, ERBB2, ERBB3, FGFR2, MET and PTEN. These biomarkers were profiled to assess gene copy number by fluorescent in situ hybridization (FISH) and/or protein expression by immunohistochemistry (IHC). All 32 PDGCX models retained the histological features of the corresponding human tumors. Furthermore, among the 32 models, 78% (25/32) highly expressed ERBB1 (EGFR), 22% (7/32) were ERBB2 (HER2) positive, 78% (25/32) showed ERBB3 (HER3) high expression, 66% (21/32) lost PTEN expression, 3% (1/32) harbored FGFR2 amplification, 41% (13/32) were positive for MET expression and 16% (5/32) were MET gene amplified. Between the PDGCX models and their parental tumors, a high degree of similarity was observed for FGFR2 and MET gene amplification, and also for ERBB2 status (agreement rate = 94~100%; kappa value = 0.81~1). Protein expression of PTEN and MET also showed moderate agreement (agreement rate = 78%; kappa value = 0.46~0.56), while ERBB1 and ERBB3 expression showed slight agreement (agreement rate = 59~75%; kappa value = 0.18~0.19). ERBB2 positivity, FGFR2 or MET gene amplification was all maintained until passage 12 in mice. The stability of the molecular profiles observed across subsequent passages within the individual models provides confidence in the utility and translational significance of these models for in vivo testing of personalized therapies."
https://openalex.org/W1550072693,"The study of cancer, a highly heterogeneous disease with different causes and clinical outcomes, requires a multi-angle approach and the collection of large multi-omics datasets that, ideally, should be analyzed simultaneously. We present a new pathway relevance ranking method that is able to prioritize pathways according to the information contained in any combination of tumor related omics datasets. Key to the method is the conversion of all available data into a single comprehensive network representation containing not only genes but also individual patient samples. Additionally, all data are linked through a network of previously identified molecular interactions. We demonstrate the performance of the new method by applying it to breast and ovarian cancer datasets from The Cancer Genome Atlas. By integrating gene expression, copy number, mutation and methylation data, the method’s potential to identify key pathways involved in breast cancer development shared by different molecular subtypes is illustrated. Interestingly, certain pathways were ranked equally important for different subtypes, even when the underlying (epi)-genetic disturbances were diverse. Next to prioritizing universally high-scoring pathways, the pathway ranking method was able to identify subtype-specific pathways. Often the score of a pathway could not be motivated by a single mutation, copy number or methylation alteration, but rather by a combination of genetic and epi-genetic disturbances, stressing the need for a network-based data integration approach. The analysis of ovarian tumors, as a function of survival-based subtypes, demonstrated the method’s ability to correctly identify key pathways, irrespective of tumor subtype. A differential analysis of survival-based subtypes revealed several pathways with higher importance for the bad-outcome patient group than for the good-outcome patient group. Many of the pathways exhibiting higher importance for the bad-outcome patient group could be related to ovarian tumor proliferation and survival."
https://openalex.org/W1959075511,"Airguns used in seismic surveys are among the most prevalent and powerful anthropogenic noise sources in marine habitats. They are designed to produce most energy below 100 Hz, but the pulses have also been reported to contain medium-to-high frequency components with the potential to affect small marine mammals, which have their best hearing sensitivity at higher frequencies. In shallow water environments, inhabited by many of such species, the impact of airgun noise may be particularly challenging to assess due to complex propagation conditions. To alleviate the current lack of knowledge on the characteristics and propagation of airgun pulses in shallow water with implications for effects on small marine mammals, we recorded pulses from a single airgun with three operating volumes (10 in3, 25 in3 and 40 in3) at six ranges (6, 120, 200, 400, 800 and 1300 m) in a uniform shallow water habitat using two calibrated Reson 4014 hydrophones and four DSG-Ocean acoustic data recorders. We show that airgun pulses in this shallow habitat propagated out to 1300 meters in a way that can be approximated by a 18log(r) geometric transmission loss model, but with a high pass filter effect from the shallow water depth. Source levels were back-calculated to 192 dB re µPa2s (sound exposure level) and 200 dB re 1 µPa dB Leq-fast (rms over 125 ms duration), and the pulses contained substantial energy up to 10 kHz, even at the furthest recording station at 1300 meters. We conclude that the risk of causing hearing damage when using single airguns in shallow waters is small for both pinnipeds and porpoises. However, there is substantial potential for significant behavioral responses out to several km from the airgun, well beyond the commonly used shut-down zone of 500 meters."
https://openalex.org/W2195453043,"Lipolytic enzymes have attracted attention from a global market because they show enormous biotechnological potential for applications such as detergent production, leather processing, cosmetics production, and use in perfumes and biodiesel. Due to the intense demand for biocatalysts, a metagenomic approach provides methods of identifying new enzymes. In this study, an esterase designated as Est16 was selected from 4224 clones of a fosmid metagenomic library, revealing an 87% amino acid identity with an esterase/lipase (accession number ADM63076.1) from an uncultured bacterium. Phylogenetic studies showed that the enzyme belongs to family V of bacterial lipolytic enzymes and has sequence and structural similarities with an aryl-esterase from Pseudomonas fluorescens and a patented Anti-Kazlauskas lipase (patent number US20050153404). The protein was expressed and purified as a highly soluble, thermally stable enzyme that showed a preference for basic pH. Est16 exhibited activity toward a wide range of substrates and the highest catalytic efficiency against p-nitrophenyl butyrate and p-nitrophenyl valerate. Est16 also showed tolerance to the presence of organic solvents, detergents and metals. Based on molecular modeling, we showed that the large alpha-beta domain is conserved in the patented enzymes but not the substrate pocket. Here, it was demonstrated that a metagenomic approach is suitable for discovering the lipolytic enzyme diversity and that Est16 has the biotechnological potential for use in industrial processes."
https://openalex.org/W1651644620,"In 2003, the Ethiopian Ministry of Health established the Health Extension Program (HEP), with the goal of improving access to health care and health promotion activities in rural areas of the country. This paper aims to assess the association of the HEP with improved utilization of maternal health services in Northern Ethiopia using institution-based retrospective data.Average quarterly total attendances for antenatal care (ANC), delivery care (DC) and post-natal care (PNC) at health posts and health care centres were studied from 2002 to 2012. Regression analysis was applied to two models to assess whether trends were statistically significant. One model was used to estimate the level and trend changes associated with the immediate period of intervention, while changes related to the post-intervention period were estimated by the other.The total number of consultations for ANC, DC and PNC increased constantly, particularly after the late-intervention period. Increases were higher for ANC and PNC at health post level and for DC at health centres. A positive statistically significant upward trend was found for DC and PNC in all facilities (p<0.01). The positive trend was also present in ANC at health centres (p = 0.04), but not at health posts.Our findings revealed an increase in the use of antenatal, delivery and post-natal care after the introduction of the HEP. We are aware that other factors, that we could not control for, might be explaining that increase. The figures for DC and PNC are however low and more needs to be done in order to increase the access to the health care system as well as the demand for these services by the population. Strengthening of the health information system in the region needs also to be prioritized."

A commercially available FVA measurement system (AS-28; Kowa, Aichi, Japan) was modified to measure FVA under mesopic conditions as well as photopic conditions. Measurements were performed monocularly in photopic conditions during 60 seconds. After dark adaptation for 15 minutes, the same measurements were repeated in mesopic conditions. Outcomes included starting visual acuity (VA), FVA (the average of VAs), visual maintenance ratio (VMR), maximum VA, minimum VA, and numbers of blinks during the 60-second measurement session, and were compared between mesopic and photopic conditions. Starting VA was -0.11 ± 0.08 and 0.39 ± 0.12 logarithm of the minimum angle of resolution (logMAR) in photopic and mesopic conditions, respectively. FVA was -0.06 ± 0.09 and 0.52 ± 0.14 logMAR, VMR was 0.98 ± 0.02 and 0.94 ± 0.04, maximum VA was -0.15 ± 0.06 and 0.33 ± 0.12 logMAR, the minimum VA was 0.05 ± 0.12 and 0.78 ± 0.20 logMAR, and the number of blinks was 8.23 ± 7.54 and 7.23 ± 6.20, respectively. All these parameters except the number of blinks were significantly different between the two conditions (P < 0.001). Besides, the difference between maximum and minimum VAs and standard deviation of VA were significantly larger in mesopic than in photopic conditions (P < 0.001). This study revealed that not only overall visual function decline but also instability of vision under mesopic conditions even in healthy subjects."
https://openalex.org/W1900341762,"RNF144A, an E3 ubiquitin ligase for DNA-dependent protein kinase catalytic subunit (DNA-PKcs), can promote DNA damage-induced cell apoptosis. Here we characterize an important regulation of RNF144A through its transmembrane (TM) domain. The TM domain of RNF144A is highly conserved among species. Deletion of the TM domain abolishes its membrane localization and also significantly reduces its ubiquitin ligase activity. Further evidence shows that the TM domain is required for RNF144A self-association and that the self-association may be partially mediated through a classic GXXXG interaction motif. A mutant RNF144A-G252L/G256L (in the G252XXXG256 motif) preserves membrane localization but is defective in self-association and ubiquitin ligase activity. On the other hand, a membrane localization loss mutant of RNF144A still retains self-association and E3 ligase activity, which can be blocked by additional G252L/G256L mutations. Therefore, our data demonstrate that the TM domain of RNF144A has at least two independent roles, membrane localization and E3 ligase activation, to regulate its physiological function. This regulatory mechanism may be applicable to other RBR (RING1-IBR-RING2) E3 ubiquitin ligases because, first, RNF144B also self-associates. Second, all five TM-containing RBR E3 ligases, including RNF144A and RNF144B, RNF19A/Dorfin, RNF19B, and RNF217, have the RBR-TM(GXXXG) superstructure.

Most of those important functions are dependent on the ubiquitin ligase activity of the RNF144 subfamily. However, the mechanisms that regulate RNF144A activity remain unknown. RNF144, RNF19, and RNF217 are three RBR ubiquitin ligase subfamilies that contain a TM domain. However, the function of these TM domains is not well characterized. Most TM domains do not just restrict the localization of these TM-containing proteins on the membrane but also have other important functions (such as self-association) (29Sparr E. Ash W.L. Nazarov P.V. Rijkers D.T. Hemminga M.A. Tieleman D.P. Killian J.A. Self-association of transmembrane α-helices in model membranes: importance of helix orientation and role of hydrophobic mismatch.J.

Our previous study has demonstrated that RNF144A is an E3 ubiquitin ligase and that the TM domain is required for its membrane localization. Deletion of the C-terminal TM domain of RNF144A significantly reduces its autoubiquitination. However, the mechanism was not known (18Ho S.R. Mahanic C.S. Lee Y.J. Lin W.C.

In this study, we show that the TM domain is required for RNF144A self-association-dependent activation of ubiquitin ligase activity at least in part through a classic GXXXG motif. Deletion of the TM domain of RNF144B also abolishes its self-association, suggesting that the TM domain-dependent activation of E3 ligase activity might be a common mechanism in the RNF144 subfamily. HEK293T cells or human osteosarcoma U2OS cells were maintained in DMEM or McCoy's 5A medium supplemented with 10% FBS, penicillin (50 IU/ml), and streptomycin (50 μg/ml). All cells were grown in a humidified incubator at 37 °C with 5% CO2 and 95% air. A standard Lipofectamine® 2000 (Life Technologies) method was used for transfection of HEK293T or U2OS cells. All reagents, chemicals, and antibodies were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich unless indicated otherwise. The antibodies specific to RNF144A were purchased from Abcam (catalog nos. ab75054 and ab89260) and Novus Biological (catalog no. NBP1-01049). DNA-PKcs Ab-4 antibody was purchased from NeoMarkers.

In brief, the mammalian expression pCMV-Tag2B vector was used for cloning of the FLAG-RNF144A and FLAG-RNF144A truncated mutants. Mutations of FLAG-RNF144A and RNF144B were generated using QuikChange II site-directed mutagenesis kits (Agilent Technologies).

The sequences of all constructs were verified by sequencing in the Baylor College of Medicine DNA sequencing core facility. For co-IP, the transfected cells were harvested 24–48 h after transfection with TNN buffer (50 mm Tris, 0.25 m NaCl, 5 mm EDTA, and 0.5% Nonidet P-40) supplemented with 1 mm dithiothreitol, 1 mm NaF, 1 mm sodium orthovanadate, 20 nm microcystin, and a mixture of protease inhibitors. A 10% aliquot of the cell lysates was saved for protein input control, and immunoprecipitation was carried out using FLAG M2 beads (Sigma-Aldrich) overnight and resolved by 10% or 4–15% gradient SDS-PAGE (Bio-Rad). Specific signals were detected with the appropriate antibodies. Cells prepared for direct Western blot analysis were lysed in radioimmune precipitation assay buffer (50 mm Tris (pH 8.0), 150 mm NaCl, 0.5% sodium deoxycholate, 1% Nonidet P-40, and 0.1% SDS). Equal amounts of proteins were resolved by SDS-PAGE and then probed with the indicated antibodies. For immunofluorescence, the cells were stained with a rabbit FLAG antibody (catalog no. F7245, Sigma-Aldrich) and a fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated secondary antibody. The nuclei were stained with Hoechst 33258. Images were captured on a Zeiss fluorescence microscope equipped with ApoTome 2 (Axio Observer inverted microscope). GST-tagged RNF144A constructs were subcloned from FLAG-tagged RNF144A using BamHI/XhoI sites. Protein purification was performed as described previously (18Ho S.R. Mahanic C.S. Lee Y.J. Lin W.C. RNF144A, an E3 ubiquitin ligase for DNA-PKcs, promotes apoptosis during DNA damage.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2014; 111: E2646-E2655Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). Briefly, Escherichia coli strain DH5α transformed with either the pGEX-6P1 vector, pGEX-6P1-RNF144A-WT (a.a. 1–292), the pGEX-6P1-RNF144A-RING1 mutant (C20A/C23A), pGEX-6P1-RNF144A-ΔTM (Δa.a. 250–270), and pGEX-6P1-RNF144A-RBR (a.a. 1–229) were cultured in Luria-Bertani broth medium containing ampicillin at 37 °C to an A600 value of 0.6. GST fusion proteins were induced by 0.5 mm isopropyl 1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside at 37 °C for 3 h. GST-tagged proteins were purified using glutathione-Sepharose 4B (GE Healthcare). The in vitro auto-ubiquitination assay was performed in 50 μl of reaction buffer (50 mm Tris (pH 8), 1 mm dithiothreitol, 5 mm MgCl2, 100 mm NaCl, and 5 mm ATP or 5 μl 10× energy regeneration solution (Boston Biochem)). In each reaction, 15 nm human recombinant E1 (Boston Biochem), 0.5 mm UbcH7 (Boston Biochem), and 5 mm HA-ubiquitin (Boston Biochem) were mixed with 0.77–1 mm GST-RNF144A or GST-RNF144A mutants in the reaction buffer and incubated at 37 °C for 90 min. Samples were then washed with 1× PBS five times and subjected to SDS-PAGE for Western blot. The membranes were blotted using the indicated antibody. The in vivo ubiquitination assay was performed as described previously (18Ho S.R. Mahanic C.S. Lee Y.J. Lin W.C.

Briefly, HEK293T cells were cotransfected with HA-tagged ubiquitin and FLAG-tagged RNF144A (WT or mutants) for 24 h as indicated. Cells were treated with 20 μm MG132 for 6 or 8 h before collection. Cells were then lysed in radioimmune precipitation assay buffer or SDS lysis buffer (1% SDS and 60 mm Tris (pH 6.8)), followed by boiling for 5 min at 95 °C. The denatured cell lysates were reconstituted to 0.1% SDS by 1:10 dilution in TNN buffer supplemented with a mixture of protease inhibitors. The lysates were then sonicated and clarified by centrifugation at 12,000 rpm (16,000 × g) for 10 min in a microfuge. Equivalent amounts of lysates were incubated overnight with DNA-PKcs antibody/protein G-agarose at 4 °C. Beads were washed five times with radioimmune precipitation assay buffer and subjected to SDS-PAGE, followed by Western blot analysis using anti-HA and anti-DNA-PKcs antibodies. HEK293T cells were transiently transfected with FLAG-tagged RNF144A-WT or mutants for 24 h, and then harvested for cytosol soluble enriched fractionation in the Tris:EDTA 20:2 solution on ice for 15 min. The insoluble fraction (nuclei, subcellular organelles, and plasma membrane) was spun down in a microfuge at 16,000 × g for 60 min. The enriched nuclei were dissolved in TNN lysis buffer. The total cell lysates, nuclear extract, and supernatant were subjected to immunoblotting. The blot was probed with anti-GAPDH, anti-p84, and anti-RNF197 (or anti-EGF receptor) antibodies as cytosolic, nuclear, and membrane markers, respectively. HEK293T cells were transiently transfected with FLAG-RNF144A-WT or empty vector for 24 h and then harvested for anti-FLAG IP. The immunoprecipitated proteins were aliquoted equally into two tubes. The tubes were washed and incubated with either 20 mm freshly prepared dimethyl pimelimidate-2HCl (Thermo Scientific) in one tube or vehicle control in the other tube for 60 min. An equal volume of 50 mm NH4Cl in 1× PBS was added for 10 min to quench the reaction (30Liu K. Graves J.D. Scott J.D. Li R. Lin W.C. Akt switches TopBP1 function from checkpoint activation to transcriptional regulation through phosphoserine binding-mediated oligomerization.Mol. Cell. Biol. 2013; 33: 4685-4700Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). The samples were subjected to SDS-PAGE and Western blot analysis. To determine whether the single-spanning TM of RNF144A is required for its autoubiquitination, we constructed GST-RNF144A-WT (a.a. 1–292), the GST-RNF144A-RING1 mutant (C20A/C23A), GST-RNF144A-ΔTM (Δa.a. 250–270), and the GST-RNF144A-RBR mutant (a.a. 1–229) and performed an in vitro autoubiquitination assay (Fig. 1). Consistent with our previous study, GST-RNF144A-WT, but not the GST-RNF144A-RBR mutant, was able to exhibit clear monoubiquitination in this assay (Fig. 1B) (18Ho S.R. Mahanic C.S. Lee Y.J. Lin W.C.

Furthermore, this monoubiquitination also disappeared in both the GST-RNF144A-RING1 mutant and GST-RNF144A-ΔTM, indicating that both RING1 and the TM domain are required for RNF144A ubiquitin ligase activity (Fig. 1C). RNF144A is heavily ubiquitinated in vivo (18Ho S.R. Mahanic C.S. Lee Y.J. Lin W.C. RNF144A, an E3 ubiquitin ligase for DNA-PKcs, promotes apoptosis during DNA damage.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2014; 111: E2646-E2655Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar), which is characteristic of most ubiquitin ligases. However, RNF144A-ΔTM dramatically lost this ubiquitination (Fig. 1D). Because there is no lysine residue for ubiquitination on the TM domain (Fig. 2A), these data suggest that the TM domain of RNF144A is important for its E3 ligase activity.FIGURE 2RNF144A possesses ubiquitin ligase activity independent of its membrane localization in vivo.

Different FLAG-tagged RNF144A plasmids were transfected into U2OS cells. The next day, cells were fixed and stained with anti-FLAG antibody (green) and Hoechst 33258 (blue, DNA). Immunofluorescence images (×100) were acquired by a Zeiss inverted microscope. D, Western blot analysis showing that FLAG-RNF144A-3L259R mainly localized at the cytoplasmic soluble fraction.

As the incidence of high-risk human papillomavirus (HPV)-related HNSCC is increasing globally, we analyzed the patterns of SPM occurrence, the effect of the index tumor site along with attributes to HPV, and the effect of SPM on survival in South Korean patients with head and neck cancer (HNC). Data were retrieved from the Korea Central Cancer Registry, a nationwide population-based cancer registry, from 1993 to 2010. Standardized incidence ratios were analyzed and compared between index tumor sites, particularly oropharyngeal vs. non-oropharyngeal sites. After adjustment for competing risks, 3- and 5-year SPM rates were calculated using the cumulative incidence function. The effects of SPM occurrence on overall survival (OS) were then analyzed. SPM rates were significantly lower for HPV-attributable oropharyngeal sites than for non-oropharyngeal sites, such as the larynx and hypopharynx (p<0.001). SPM rates were also lower for oral cavity first primary sites than for non-oropharyngeal first primary sites (p<0.001). SPMs typically occurred in the esophagus, lungs and the head and neck. Uterine cervical cancers occurred significantly more frequently after index oropharyngeal cancer in women. The 5-year and 10-year OS rates were 57.8 and 45.7% in all HNC patients, respectively. The OS after SPM occurrence was poor (5-year, 31.8%; 10-year, 20.8%) compared to after index HNC occurrence (5-year, 68.4%; 10-year, 41.2%). SPM occurrence in the esophagus and lung/bronchus showed a worse OS than SPM localized to the head and neck. South Korean HNC patient, the first primary cancer site affected SPM risk and distribution. The 5- and 10-year OS rates deteriorated after SPM occurrence, particularly in the esophagus and lungs. Further optimization of follow-up strategies for effective surveillance of SPM, particularly in the esophagus and lungs, is warranted."

It is generally accepted that the phosphate is removed by the laforin phosphatase. To study the dynamics of skeletal muscle glycogen phosphorylation in vivo under physiological conditions, mice were subjected to glycogen-depleting exercise and then monitored while they resynthesized glycogen. Depletion of glycogen by exercise was associated with a substantial reduction in total glycogen phosphate and the newly resynthesized glycogen was less branched and less phosphorylated. Branching returned to normal on a time frame of days, whereas phosphorylation remained suppressed over a longer period of time. We observed no change in markers of autophagy. Exercise of 3-month-old laforin knock-out mice caused a similar depletion of glycogen but no loss of glycogen phosphate. Furthermore, remodeling of glycogen to restore the basal branching pattern was delayed in the knock-out animals. From these results, we infer that 1) laforin is responsible for glycogen dephosphorylation during exercise and acts during the cytosolic degradation of glycogen, 2) excess glycogen phosphorylation in the absence of laforin delays the normal remodeling of the branching structure, and 3) the accumulation of glycogen phosphate is a relatively slow process involving multiple cycles of glycogen synthesis-degradation, consistent with the slow onset of the symptoms of Lafora disease.

This study explored community members' (men and women) and healthcare workers' perceptions of male involvement in the prevention of mother-to-child transmission of HIV in Khayelitsha, South Africa. Two focus group discussions were held with 25 men of unknown HIV status and one focus group discussion held with 12 HIV-positive women in the community. In depth interviews were conducted with four HIV-positive couples and five service providers purposely sampled from the community and a health facility, respectively. Both men and women interviewed in this study were receptive towards male involvement in PMTCT. However, men were reluctant to engage with health services due to stigma and negative attitudes from nurses. This study also found HIV testing, disclosure and direct health worker engagement with men increases male involvement in PMTCT. Using men in the media and community to reach out to fellow men with prevention messages tailored to suit specific audiences may reduce perceptions of antenatal care as being a woman`s domain."
https://openalex.org/W1567604666,"The aim of present study was to investigate the effects of ammonium ions on in vitro neuronal network activity and to search alternative methods of acute ammonia neurotoxicity prevention.Rat hippocampal neuronal and astrocytes co-cultures in vitro, fluorescent microscopy and perforated patch clamp were used to monitor the changes in intracellular Ca2+- and membrane potential produced by ammonium ions and various modulators in the cells implicated in neural networks.Low concentrations of NH4Cl (0.1-4 mM) produce short temporal effects on network activity. Application of 5-8 mM NH4Cl: invariably transforms diverse network firing regimen to identical burst patterns, characterized by substantial neuronal membrane depolarization at plateau phase of potential and high-amplitude Ca2+-oscillations; raises frequency and average for period of oscillations Ca2+-level in all cells implicated in network; results in the appearance of group of «run out» cells with high intracellular Ca2+ and steadily diminished amplitudes of oscillations; increases astrocyte Ca2+-signalling, characterized by the appearance of groups of cells with increased intracellular Ca2+-level and/or chaotic Ca2+-oscillations. Accelerated network activity may be suppressed by the blockade of NMDA or AMPA/kainate-receptors or by overactivation of AMPA/kainite-receptors. Ammonia still activate neuronal firing in the presence of GABA(A) receptors antagonist bicuculline, indicating that «disinhibition phenomenon» is not implicated in the mechanisms of networks acceleration. Network activity may also be slowed down by glycine, agonists of metabotropic inhibitory receptors, betaine, L-carnitine, L-arginine, etc.Obtained results demonstrate that ammonium ions accelerate neuronal networks firing, implicating ionotropic glutamate receptors, having preserved the activities of group of inhibitory ionotropic and metabotropic receptors. This may mean, that ammonia neurotoxicity might be prevented by the activation of various inhibitory receptors (i.e. by the reinforcement of negative feedback control), instead of application of various enzyme inhibitors and receptor antagonists (breaking of neural, metabolic and signaling systems)."
https://openalex.org/W953791947,"Introduction Rotavirus (RV) infection in neonatal age can be mild or even asymptomatic. Several studies have reported that RV is responsible for 31%-87% of pediatric nosocomial diarrhea and causes gastroenteritis outbreaks in pediatric and neonatal units. Objectives Study clinical characteristics, genotypes and risk factors of RV infection in neonatal age. Methods A prospective study was conducted from April 2009 till April 2013 in the neonatal special care unit of the largest tertiary pediatric hospital of Greece. Fecal samples and epidemiological data were collected from each neonate with gastrointestinal symptoms. RV antigen was detected with a rapid immunochromatography test. RV positive samples were further genotyped with RT PCR and sequencing using specific VP7 and VP4 primers. Results Positive for RV were 126/415 samples (30.4%). Mean age of onset was 18 days. Seventy four cases (58%) were hospital acquired. Seasonality of RV infection did not differ significantly throughout the year with the exception of 4 outbreaks. Genotypes found during the study period were G4P[8] (58.7%), G1P[8] (14.7%), G12P[8] (9.3%), G3P[8] (9.3%), G12P[6] (5.3%), G9P[8] (1.3%) and G2P[4] (1.3%). RV cases presented with: diarrhea (81%), vomiting (26.2%), fever (34.9%), dehydration (28.6%), feeding intolerance (39.7%), weight loss (54%), whilst 19% of cases were asymptomatic. Comparing community with hospital acquired cases differences in clinical manifestations were found. Conclusions Significant incidence of nosocomially transmitted RV infection in neonatal age including asymptomatic illness exists. Genotypes causing nosocomial outbreaks are not different from community strains. Circulating vaccines can be effective in prevention of nosocomial RV infection through herd immunity."

This study assessed the heatwave-mortality relationship using different study periods in the three largest Australian cities (Brisbane, Melbourne and Sydney).Daily data on climatic variables and mortality for the three cities were obtained from relevant government agencies between 1988 and 2011. A consistent definition of heatwaves was used for these cities. Poisson generalised additive model was fitted to assess the impact of heatwaves on mortality.Non-accidental and circulatory mortality significantly increased during heatwaves across the three cities even with different heatwave definitions and study periods. Using the summer data resulted in the largest increase in effect estimates compared to those using the warm season or the whole year data.The findings may have implications for developing standard approaches to evaluating the heatwave-mortality relationship and advancing heat health warning systems. It also provides an impetus to methodological advance for assessing climate change-related health consequences."
https://openalex.org/W1513373964,"Purpose Spinal surgery in a previously irradiated field carries increased risk of perioperative complications, such as delayed wound healing or wound infection. In addition, adhesion around the dura mater is often observed clinically. Therefore, similar to radiation-induced fibrosis—a major late-stage radiation injury in other tissue—epidural fibrosis is anticipated to occur after spinal radiation. In this study, we performed histopathologic assessment of postirradiation changes in the spinal dura mater and peridural tissue in mice. Materials and Methods The thoracolumbar transition of ddY mice was irradiated with a single dose of 10 or 20 Gy. After resection of the irradiated spine, occurrence of epidural fibrosis and expression of transforming growth factor beta 1 in the spinal dura mater were evaluated. In addition, microstructures in the spinal dura mater and peridural tissue were assessed using an electron microscope. Results In the 20-Gy irradiated mice, epidural fibrosis first occurred around 12 weeks postirradiation, and was observed in all cases from 16 weeks postirradiation. In contrast, epidural fibrosis was not observed in the nonirradiated mice. Compared with the nonirradiated mice, the 10- and 20-Gy irradiated mice had significantly more overexpression of transforming growth factor beta 1 at 1 week postirradiation and in the late stages after irradiation. In microstructural assessment, the arachnoid barrier cell layer was thinned at 12 and 24 weeks postirradiation compared with that in the nonirradiated mice. Conclusion In mice, spinal epidural fibrosis develops in the late stages after high-dose irradiation, and overexpression of transforming growth factor beta 1 occurs in a manner similar to that seen in radiation-induced fibrosis in other tissue. Additionally, thinning of the arachnoid barrier cell layer was observed in the late stages after irradiation. Thus, consideration should be given to the possibility that these phenomena can occur as radiation-induced injuries of the spine."
https://openalex.org/W955558374,"To determine whether the degree of venous tortuosity is significantly correlated with the aqueous vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) concentration in eyes with a central retinal vein occlusion (CRVO).We reviewed the medical records of 32 eyes of 32 patients who had macular edema due to a CRVO. All of the patients were examined at the Nagoya University Hospital and were scheduled to receive an intravitreal injection of bevacizumab (IVB) or ranibizumab (IVR) within 12 weeks of the onset of the CRVO to treat the macular edema. Aqueous humor was collected just before the IVB or IVR, and the VEGF concentration was determined by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). The venous tortuosity index was calculated by dividing the length of the retinal veins by the chord length of the same segment. The correlation between the mean tortuosity index of the inferotemporal and supratemporal branches of the retinal vein and the aqueous VEGF concentration was determined.The mean aqueous VEGF concentration was 384 ± 312 pg/ml with a range of 90 to 1077 pg/ml. The degree of venous tortuosity was significantly correlated with the VEGF concentration in the aqueous. (r = 0.49, P = 0.004), with the foveal thickness (r = 0.40, P = 0.02), and with the best-corrected visual acuity (r = 0.38, P = 0.03).The significant correlation between the aqueous VEGF concentration and the venous tortuosity indicates that the degree of retinal venous tortuosity can be used to identify eyes that are at a high risk of developing neovascularization."
https://openalex.org/W994563114,"We recently showed that inter-keratin disulfide bonding plays an important role in the assembly, organization, and dynamics of keratin intermediate filaments in skin keratinocytes.

Although individually rare, these diseases are often devastating, and there is unfortunately no effective treatment for disorders rooted in defective IFs (5McLean W.H. Moore C.B.

In part, the inability to therapeutically intervene reflects a limited understanding of the assembly and detailed structure of all types of intermediate filaments and of the mechanisms defining their intracellular organization and dynamics. intermediate filament cysteine-free tris(2-carboxyethyl) phosphine unit-length filament. Although highly variable in size (40–240 kDa) and primary structure, all IF proteins share a tripartite domain structure, consisting of a central α-helical (rod) domain of conserved length and substructure, flanked by non-helical N-terminal head and C-terminal tail domains of variable length and primary structure (7Fuchs E. Weber K. Intermediate filaments: structure, dynamics, function, and disease.Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1994; 63: 345-382Crossref PubMed Scopus (1278) Google Scholar, 8Herrmann H. Aebi U. Intermediate filaments: molecular structure, assembly mechanism, and integration into functionally distinct intracellular scaffolds.Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2004; 73: 749-789Crossref PubMed Scopus (551) Google Scholar). IF assembly is driven largely by the central rod domain, given long-range heptad repeats mediating coiled-coil dimerization and higher order interactions, with variable contributions from the head and tail domains (depending of the IF system), notably with regard to post-translational modifications and interactions with associated proteins (9Snider N.T. Omary M.B. Post-translational modifications of intermediate filament proteins: mechanisms and functions.Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2014; 15: 163-177Crossref PubMed Scopus (329) Google Scholar). In vivo, IF proteins assemble into 10-nm filaments either as obligate (e.g. keratins, neurofilaments) or facultative (e.g. vimentin, glial fibrillary acidic protein) heteropolymers (8Herrmann H. Aebi U. Intermediate filaments: molecular structure, assembly mechanism, and integration into functionally distinct intracellular scaffolds.Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2004; 73: 749-789Crossref PubMed Scopus (551) Google Scholar). IF assembly appears complex and even polymorphic but can be readily recapitulated from purified proteins in vitro (10Steinert P.M. Idler W.W. Zimmerman S.B.

Unifying principles in intermediate filament assembly.Protoplasma. 1988; 145: 73-81Crossref Scopus (105) Google Scholar). Further, live imaging studies over the last decade suggest that, in cultured epithelial cells, keratin IF assembly is initiated at the cell periphery and is completed as filament precursors become incorporated into a network that continuously flows toward the center of the cell, culminating in the formation of a robust perinuclear array of filaments (13Kölsch A. Windoffer R. Würflinger T. Aach T. Leube R.E. The keratin-filament cycle of assembly and disassembly.J. Cell Sci. 2010; 123: 2266-2272Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar, 14Windoffer R.

Despite this progress, much remains to be learned about the processes that preside over keratin assembly and network organization, in vitro as well as in vivo. Disulfide bonding recently came to the fore as a novel and important mechanism that regulates the assembly, organization, and dynamics of keratin 14 (a type I keratin expressed in the progenitor basal layer of stratified epithelia)-containing intermediate filaments in skin keratinocytes (16Lee C.H. Kim M.S. Chung B.M. Leahy D.J. Coulombe P.A. Structural basis for heteromeric assembly and perinuclear organization of keratin filaments.Nat. Struct. Mol. Biol. 2012; 19: 707-715Crossref PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar, 17Feng X. Coulombe P.A. A role for disulfide bonding in keratin intermediate filament organization and dynamics in skin keratinocytes.J. Cell Biol. 2015; 209: 59-72Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). Particularly, residue Cys-367 in the central α-helical rod domain of human K14 mediates a trans-dimer homotypic disulfide bond in a crystal of the interacting K5/K14 rod domains as well as in epidermal keratinocytes in vivo (16Lee C.H. Kim M.S. Chung B.M. Leahy D.J. Coulombe P.A. Structural basis for heteromeric assembly and perinuclear organization of keratin filaments.Nat. Struct. Mol. Biol. 2012; 19: 707-715Crossref PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar). This cysteine and its associated disulfide bonds play a key role in the formation and/or maintenance of a perinuclear-concentrated network of keratin IFs and in the centripetal keratin filament cycle observed in epidermal keratinocytes in primary culture (17Feng X. Coulombe P.A. A role for disulfide bonding in keratin intermediate filament organization and dynamics in skin keratinocytes.J. Cell Biol. 2015; 209: 59-72Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). The data in hand also show that, albeit important, Cys-367 does not account for all of the disulfide bonding-dependent properties of K14 in vitro and in vivo. In this study, we uncover complementary roles for two additional cysteine residues located in the non-helical head domain of K14, Cys-4 and Cys-40. As is the case for Cys-367, K14 Cys-4 and Cys-40 play key roles toward both the assembly and organization of keratin IFs. Further, we present evidence that all three cysteine residues act in concert to foster the execution of a normal keratin cycle in live cultures of epidermal keratinocytes. The human K14 (NP_000517) and K5 (NP_000415) protein sequences can be accessed at the Human Intermediate Filament Database and the National Center for Biotechnology Information. Based on the simple nucleotide polymorphism database (dbSNP 142), human K14 (gene ID 3861) has an “A→G” SNP (dbSNP ID rs6503640), resulting in a missense variant (Tyr-63 → Cys) (UCSC Genome Browser Database). Because this SNP is relatively rare (0.739%; given 37 Cys and 4971 Tyr alleles among 5008 human genomes surveyed), it was not investigated in our study. Plasmids pT7HMT-K14WT, pT7HMT-K14CF, pT7HMT-K14CF-C367, and pT7HMT-K5WT (for in vitro studies); pBK-CMV His-GFP-K14WT, pBK-CMV His-GFP-K14CF, pBK-CMV His-GFP-K14C367A, pBK-CMV His-GFP-K14CF-C367, and pBK-CMV His-GFP-K14C389A (for expression in mammalian cells); and pShuttle-CMV-H2B-mCherry (live cell imaging study) have been described (16Lee C.H.

Targeted cysteine-to-alanine replacements (e.g. C4A, C18A, C40A, C4A/C40A, and the triple C4A/C40A/C367A variant) were introduced into the K14WT cDNA using the QuikChange lightning site-directed mutagenesis kit (Agilent Technologies). Selective cysteine restorations (e.g. Cys-4, Cys-40, Cys-4/Cys-40, and Cys-4/Cys-40/Cys-367) were created on the K14 cysteine-free (CF) backbone using the same mutagenesis kit (Agilent Technologies). The antibodies used include anti-K5 (rabbit, 1:1000 for immunofluorescence) from Covance, anti-GFP (mouse, 1:1000) from Abcam, IRDye 800CW goat anti-mouse IgG (1:20,000) from LI-COR Biosciences, and Alexa Fluor 594 goat anti-rabbit IgG (1:1000) from Life Technologies, Inc. DAPI was from Life Technologies, tris(2-carboxyethyl) phosphine (TCEP) was from Thermo Scientific, and N-ethylmaleimide was from Sigma-Aldrich. Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (DMEM)/calcium-free/low glucose and DMEM/calcium-free/low glucose/without phenyl red, used in the preparation of flavin adenine dinucleotide (FAD) medium and FAD imaging medium, were from United States Biological. Restriction endonucleases were from New England Biolabs. All other chemicals were obtained from Sigma-Aldrich unless noted otherwise. 308 mouse skin keratinocytes (18Strickland J.E. Greenhalgh D.A.

Cells were cultured in DMEM/low glucose supplemented with 10% FBS, 100 units/ml penicillin, and 100 μg/ml streptomycin (Life Technologies). Transfection of GFP-tagged K14 cysteine variants was performed using FuGENE HD (Promega) according to the manufacturer's instructions. At 24 h after transfection, cells were switched to Keratinocyte Basal Medium-2 without Ca2+ (KBM-2, Lonza; so-called low calcium medium) for an additional 24 h and then switched to KBM-2 supplemented with 1.8 mm calcium and 10% FBS (high-calcium medium). Keratinocytes were harvested 4 h after high-calcium switch. To prepare whole cell lysates, cells were lysed in cold urea lysis buffer (pH 7.0) (6.5 m urea; 50 mm Tris-HCl; 150 mm sodium chloride; 5 mm EDTA; 0.1% Triton X-100; 50 μm N-ethylmaleimide; 1 mm PMSF; 1 μg/ml each of chymostatin, leupeptin, and pepstatin; 10 μg/ml each of aprotinin and benzamidine; 2 μg/ml antipain; and 50 mm sodium fluoride), and then pelleted via centrifugation (14,000 rpm for 30 min at 4 °C) in order to remove cell debris. For immunoblotting, the Bradford protein assay (Bio-Rad) was used to determine protein concentration in cell lysates. Samples for gel electrophoresis were prepared in LDS sample buffer (Life Technologies) in the presence or absence of 20 mm TCEP. TCEP treatment was performed at room temperature for 1 h in order to fully reduce disulfide bonds. Equal amounts of cell lysates were resolved by SDS-PAGE and transferred to nitrocellulose membrane (0.45 μm; Bio-Rad). Quantitative infrared immunoblotting analysis (LI-COR Biosciences) was performed using primary antibodies, followed by secondary antibodies conjugated to infrared fluorescent dye IRDye800 (1Feng X.

All studies involving mice were reviewed and approved by the Johns Hopkins Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee. Freshly isolated keratinocytes from 1- or 2-day-old Krt14−/− newborn mouse skin (19Lloyd C. Yu. Q.C. Cheng J. Turksen K. Degenstein L. Hutton E. Fuchs E.

CnT57 (low calcium, 0.07 mm; CELLnTEC) and FAD media were used for keratin IF organization and live cell imaging studies, respectively (17Feng X. Coulombe P.A. A role for disulfide bonding in keratin intermediate filament organization and dynamics in skin keratinocytes.J. Cell Biol. 2015; 209: 59-72Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). Transfected cells were fixed using prechilled methanol at 72 h post-transfection and processed for immunofluorescence staining to assess the organization of keratin IFs. Imaging of live keratinocytes was initiated at 48 h post-transfection. pShuttle-CMV-H2BmCherry was co-transfected in order to monitor the nucleus in transfected cells. Keratinocytes were fixed by prechilled methanol; blocked in 10% normal goat serum, 0.1% Triton X-100, PBS for 1 h at room temperature; incubated in anti-K5 antibody solution for 1 h; washed in PBS; incubated in Alexa Fluor 594 goat anti-rabbit IgG solution; counterstained in DAPI; and mounted in FluorSave Reagent mounting medium (Calbiochem). Pictures were acquired as single focal planes using an Axio Observer.Z1 fluorescence microscope equipped with an ApoTome II attachment and AxioCam MRm camera (Carl Zeiss Microscopy). Focal planes were selected by focusing on the center of the nuclei. Pictures were taken using a 63× plan-apochromat oil immersion objective, with the system controlled by the AxioVision version 4.8.2 software (Carl Zeiss Microscopy). Distinct modes of keratin filament network organization were analyzed by blindly counting transfected mouse keratinocytes and re-examined based on quantitative criteria for each of the three categories of keratin filament network organization (see Fig. S3 in Ref. 17Feng X. Coulombe P.A. A role for disulfide bonding in keratin intermediate filament organization and dynamics in skin keratinocytes.J. Cell Biol. 2015; 209: 59-72Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). Imaging of live keratinocytes and associated data processing were as described (17Feng X. Coulombe P.A. A role for disulfide bonding in keratin intermediate filament organization and dynamics in skin keratinocytes.J. Cell Biol. 2015; 209: 59-72Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). A single-point laser scanning confocal microscope (LSM780-FCS, Carl Zeiss Microscopy), fitted with a 40× PlanNeofluar oil immersion objective, was used to record pictures. Cells in a closed culture dish (35 mm; MatTek Corp.) were kept in an environment chamber at 37 °C with 5% CO2 and 25 °C humidity. Excitation was set at 488 nm for GFP and 561 nm for mCherry. Recording intervals were 5 min, color depth was 12 bit, and image resolution was 1024 × 1024 pixels. Seven focal planes (optical slice thickness: 0.43 μm/stack) were recorded for each time point, and the movie recording lasted 6 h. Maximum intensity projections were generated by compressing three-dimensional stacks of time series using the Zen software (Carl Zeiss Microscopy) and used for preparing figures and conversion into QuickTime movies (Apple). Reconstruction of 2.5-dimentional images from Z stacks was achieved using the Zen software. Measurements of filament length and of the fluorescence intensity of individual keratinocytes were performed using the ImageJ freeware (20Schneider C.A. Rasband W.S. Eliceiri K.W. NIH Image to ImageJ: 25 years of image analysis.Nat. Methods. 2012; 9: 671-675Crossref PubMed Scopus (34949) Google Scholar). Tracking of nuclei was performed using the Imaris software (Bitplane). Plasmids pT7HMT-K5WT, pT7HMT-K14WT, pT7HMT-K14CF, pT7HMT-K14CF-C367, pT7HMT-K14CF-C4/C40, and pT7HMT-K14CF-C4/C40/C367 were transformed into the Escherichia coli strain BL21(DE3) to produce the corresponding recombinant human keratin proteins as inclusion bodies. Keratin proteins were purified using HiTrapQ and MonoQ columns (GE Healthcare) as described (21Lee C.H. Coulombe P.A. Self-organization of keratin intermediate filaments into cross-linked networks.J. Cell Biol. 2009; 186: 409-421Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). Heterotypic complexes containing K5 and K14 in an equimolar ratio were obtained using MonoQ column chromatography (21Lee C.H. Coulombe P.A. Self-organization of keratin intermediate filaments into cross-linked networks.J. Cell Biol. 2009; 186: 409-421Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). The concentration of purified keratin complexes was adjusted to 0.15 mg/ml, and keratin filaments were assembled under either reducing or oxidizing buffer conditions as described (17Feng X. Coulombe P.A. A role for disulfide bonding in keratin intermediate filament organization and dynamics in skin keratinocytes.J. Cell Biol. 2015; 209: 59-72Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). For certain experiments, filaments assembled under oxidizing buffer conditions were subjected to a reducing environment at the postassembly stage. Physical states of the keratin polymers were analyzed using a high-speed sedimentation assay (150,000 × g for 30 min) as described previously (22Ma L. Yamada S. Wirtz D. Coulombe P.A. A “hot-spot” mutation alters the mechanical properties of keratin filament networks.Nat. Cell Biol. 2001; 3: 503-506Crossref PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar). Polymerization efficiency of filament assembly was estimated on SDS-PAGE through densitometry with the ImageJ freeware (20Schneider C.A. Rasband W.S. Eliceiri K.W. NIH Image to ImageJ: 25 years of image analysis.Nat. Methods. 2012; 9: 671-675Crossref PubMed Scopus (34949) Google Scholar). The ultrastructure of assembled keratin filaments was examined by negative staining (1% uranyl acetate) and transmission electron microscopy using HU-12A instruments (Hitachi). Measurements of filament length and diameter were performed on recorded micrographs (80,000× nominal magnification) using the AmtV602 capture engine software (Hitachi) and ImageJ freeware (20Schneider C.A. Rasband W.S. Eliceiri K.W. NIH Image to ImageJ: 25 years of image analysis.Nat. Methods. 2012; 9: 671-675Crossref PubMed Scopus (34949) Google Scholar). Statistical analyses were performed using Microsoft Excel software 2011 (Microsoft Office) and Prism version 5 (GraphPad Software, Inc.). Student's t test analysis was used to compare two conditions or samples (see Figs. 1C, 5D, and 6 (A, C, and E)). One-way analysis of variance was used to compare three conditions or samples (see Figs. 2C and 3C). A statistical p value of <0.05 was considered significant.FIGURE 5Residues Cys-4 and Cys-40 in the K14 head domain foster a normal keratin filament cycle in live mouse keratinocytes.

https://openalex.org/W1948191553,"Soil soluble nickel (Ni) concentration is very important for determining soil Ni toxicity. In the present study, the relationships between soil properties, total and soluble Ni concentrations in soils were developed in a wide range of soils with different properties and climate characteristics. The multiple regressions showed that soil pH and total soil Ni concentrations were the most significant parameters in predicting soluble Ni concentrations with the adjusted determination coefficients (Radj2) values of 0.75 and 0.68 for soils spiked with soluble Ni salt and the spiked soils leached with artificial rainwater to mimic field conditions, respectively. However, when the soils were divided into three categories (pH < 7, 7–8 and > 8), they obtained better predictions with Radj2 values of 0.78–0.90 and 0.79–0.94 for leached and unleached soils, respectively. Meanwhile, the other soil properties, such as amorphous Fe and Al oxides and clay, were also found to be important for determining soluble Ni concentrations, indicating that they were also presented as active adsorbent surfaces. Additionally, the whole soil speciation including bulk soil properties and total soils Ni concentrations were analyzed by mechanistic speciation models WHAM VI and Visual MINTEQ3.0. It was found that WHAM VI provided the best predictions for the soils with pH < 7, was relatively reasonable for pH 7 to 8, and gave an overestimation for pH > 8. The Visual MINTEQ3.0 could provide better estimation for pH < 8 and meanwhile quite reasonable results for pH > 8. These results indicated the possibility and applicability of these models to predict soil soluble Ni concentration by soil properties."
https://openalex.org/W2172235611,"Although neonatal farm animals are frequently subjected to painful management procedures, the role of maternal behaviour in pain coping, has not been much studied. We investigated whether ewes were able to distinguish between lambs in pain and those that were not, and whether their behaviour altered depending on the severity of lamb pain. Eighty male lambs were allocated to one of 4 pain treatments within 24 hours of birth. Lambs were either handled only (C), bilaterally castrated with tight rubber rings (RR), as for RR but with the application of a Burdizzo clamp immediately proximal to the ring (Combined) or subjected to short scrotum castration (SSC) where the testicles were retained within the abdomen and only the scrotum removed. The behaviour of the ewe, treated lamb and untreated sibling where present (n = 54) were recorded for 30 minutes after treatment. Castration treatment increased the expression of abnormal standing and lying postures, specific pain-related behaviours (head-turning, stamping/kicking, easing quarters, tail wagging) and composite pain scores (P<0.001 for all). The greatest expression of pain-related behaviours was shown by lambs in the RR group, which were the only group to show rolling responses indicative of severe pain, followed by the SSC group. Ewes expressed more licking/sniffing responses to the RR and SSC lambs than towards the Combined and C lambs (P<0.05), and oriented most to RR lambs and least to C lambs (P<0.001). Ewes with two lambs also directed more attention towards the treated than the untreated lamb (P<0.001). The quantity of maternal care directed towards the lamb was positively correlated with the expression of active pain behaviours. The data demonstrate that ewes are able to discriminate between lambs in pain and those that are not, and that their response is increased with a greater severity of pain."
https://openalex.org/W2120199624,"Allergy afflicts one third of children, negatively impacting their quality of life and generating a significant socio-economic burden. To this day, this disorder remains difficult to diagnose early in young patients, with no predictive test available.This study was designed to correlate cytokine profiles with clinical phenotypes of allergy development.Three hundred patients were recruited and followed from birth to 18 months of age. They were given a clinical exam at birth and at 2, 6, 12, and 18 months of age, with skin prick tests at 6, and 18 months, in order to have a record of their medical history and determine their allergic status. In addition, mononuclear cells from 131 patients were isolated from cord blood and from peripheral blood samples at 2, 6 and 18 months of age, to analyse their cytokine and chemokine production.Cord blood mononuclear cells (CBMCs) from future Immunoglobulin (Ig) E-mediated allergic children produced significantly less Interleukin (IL)-12p70 and IL-15 than cells from the rest of the cohort. Multivariate analyses revealed that the best predictive model of allergy was built on cytokine data, whereas the best predictive model of IgE-mediated allergy was built on clinical parameters.Although univariate analyses can yield interesting information regarding the immune responses of allergic children, finding predictive markers of the disorder will likely rely on monitoring multiple parameters. Nonetheless these analyses suggest a potential key role for IL-15 in the development of atopic disease. In addition, the study highlights the importance of clinical parameters in predicting the development of IgE-mediated allergy."
https://openalex.org/W1857797520,"Expression of the Bcr-Abl fusion gene in hematopoietic progenitor cells (HPCs) results in the development of chronic myelogenous leukemia (CML), for which hematopoietic microenvironment plays an important role. We investigated the specific effects of an HPC line transduced with Bcr-Abl, KOBA, on BM-derived OP9 stroma cells. DNA microarray analysis revealed that OP9 cells co-cultured with KOBA cells (OP9/L) show diverse changes in the gene expression. OP9/L cells showed significant down-regulation of Cdkn genes and up-regulation of Icam1, leading to the increased proliferation capacity of OP9 cells and enhanced transmigration of leukemia cells through them. The effects were attributed to direct Notch activation of OP9 cells by KOBA cells. OP9/L cells also showed a markedly altered cytokine gene expression pattern, including a robust increase in a variety of proinflammatory genes and a decrease in hematopoietic cytokines such as Cxcl12, Scf, and Angpt1. Consequently, OP9/L cells promoted the proliferation of KOBA cells more efficiently than parental OP9 cells, whereas the activity supporting normal myelopoiesis was attenuated. In mice bearing KOBA leukemia, the characteristic genetic changes observed in OP9/L cells were reflected differentially in the endothelial cells (ECs) and mesenchymal stroma cells (MCs) of the BM. The ECs were markedly increased with Notch-target gene activation and decreased Cdkn expression, whereas the MCs showed a marked increase in proinflammatory gene expression and a profound decrease in hematopoietic genes. Human CML cell lines also induced essentially similar genetic changes in OP9 cells. Our results suggest that CML cells remodel the hematopoietic microenvironment by changing the gene expression patterns differentially in ECs and MCs of BM."
https://openalex.org/W2298423750,"Chromoproteins (CPs) have unique colors and can be used in biological applications. In this work, a novel blue CP with a maximum absorption peak (λmax) at 608 nm was identified from the carpet anemone Stichodactyla gigantea (sgBP). In vivo expression of sgBP in zebrafish would change the appearance of the fishes to have a blue color, indicating the potential biomarker function. To enhance the color properties, the crystal structure of sgBP at 2.25 Å resolution was determined to allow structure-based protein engineering. Among the mutations conducted in the Gln-Tyr-Gly chromophore and chromophore environment, a S157C mutation shifted the λmax to 604 nm with an extinction coefficient (ε) of 58,029 M-1·cm-1 and darkened the blue color expression. The S157C mutation in the sgBP chromophore environment could affect the color expression by altering the deprotonation state of the phenolic group in the chromophore. Our results provide a structural basis for the blue color enhancement of the biomarker development."
https://openalex.org/W1501888510,"Non-volitional sex (NVS) in young people continues to be a major public health problem with long-term negative health outcomes. For the first time, the prevalence of different types of NVS and associated factors are compared between young people with same-sex sexual activities and those who have not.We obtained data from 10,401 young women and men (aged 12 to 25 years) who participated in a population study on sexual health, the Netherlands. We calculated and compared the prevalence of six types of NVS between women who had sex with men (yWSM) or women (yWSW), and men who had sex with women (yMSW) or men (yMSM). In sexually experienced participants (n = 5986) logistic regression analyses were applied to assess associations with NVS by assault or penetration. Analyses were weighted to represent the Dutch population.The prevalence of NVS ranged from 1% to 61%, depending on type. Prevalence was higher for young women (any: 40.6%) than men (any: 20.4%), and highest for yMSM and yWSW. Prevalence of NVS by assault or penetration was related to a range of socio-demographic, behavioral and social factors, which were largely similar regardless of sex or same-sex-experiences. The NVS perpetrators were in over 70% of cases known to the victim; 1 in 4 cases of NVS by penetration were accompanied by violence.A substantial proportion of young people in the Netherlands have experienced NVS. Medical professionals, educators and caregivers should integrate services to continue to address NVS by targeting young people's multifaceted risk profiles and evidenced based interventions for doing so are needed."
https://openalex.org/W1666293447,"While the fractional concentration of exhaled nitric oxide (FeNO) has proven useful in asthma research, its exact role in clinical care remains unclear, in part due to unexplained inter-subject heterogeneity. In this study, we assessed the hypothesis that the effects of determinants of the fractional concentration of exhaled nitric oxide (FeNO) vary with differing levels of FeNO. In a population-based cohort of 1542 school children aged 12–15 from the Southern California Children's Health Study, we used quantile regression to investigate if the relationships of asthma, socio-demographic and clinical covariates with FeNO vary across its distribution. Differences in FeNO between children with and without asthma increased steeply as FeNO increased (Estimated asthma effects (in ppb) at selected 20th, 50th and 80th percentiles of FeNO are 2.4, 6.3 and 22.2, respectively) but the difference was steeper with increasing FeNO in boys and in children with active rhinitis (p-values<0.01). Active rhinitis also showed significantly larger effects on FeNO at higher concentrations of FeNO (Estimated active rhinitis effects (in ppb) at selected 20th, 50th and 80th percentiles of FeNO are 2.1, 5.7 and 14.3, respectively). Boys and children of Asian descent had higher FeNO than girls and non-Hispanic whites; these differences were significantly larger in those with higher FeNO (p-values<0.01). In summary, application of quantile regression techniques provides new insights into the determinants of FeNO showing substantially varying effects in those with high versus low concentrations."
https://openalex.org/W2249043610,"The Parkes Weber syndrome is a congenital vascular malformation, characterized by varicose veins, arterio-venous fistulas and overgrown limbs. No broadly accepted animal model of Parkes Weber syndrome has been described. We created side-to-side arterio-venous fistula between common femoral vessels with proximal non-absorbable ligature on common femoral vein limiting the enlargement of the vein diameter in Wistar rats. Contralateral limb was sham operated. Invasive blood pressure measurements in both iliac and inferior cava veins were performed in rats 30 days after fistula creation. Tight circumference and femoral bone length were measured. Histopathology and morphology of soleus muscle, extensor digitorum longus muscle, and the common femoral vessel were analyzed. 30 days following arterio-venous fistula creation, a statistically significant elevation of blood pressure in common iliac vein and limb overgrowth was observed. Limb enlargement was caused by muscle overgrowth, varicose veins formation and bone elongation. Arterio-venous fistula with proximal outflow limitation led to significant increase of femoral vein circumference and venous wall thickness. Our study indicates that the described rat model mimics major clinical features characteristic for the human Parkes Weber syndrome: presence of arterio-venous fistula, venous hypertension and dilatation, varicose veins formation, and the limb hypertrophy. We reveal that limb overgrowth is caused by bone elongation, muscle hypertrophy, and venous dilatation. The newly established model will permit detailed studies on the mechanisms underlying the disease and on the efficacy of novel therapeutic strategies for the Parkes Weber syndrome treatment."
https://openalex.org/W2155183427,"Pyridoxal 5'-phosphate (PLP) dependent alanine racemase catalyzes racemization of L-Ala to D-Ala, a key component of the peptidoglycan network in bacterial cell wall. It has been extensively studied as an important antimicrobial drug target due to its restriction in eukaryotes. However, many marketed alanine racemase inhibitors also act on eukaryotic PLP-dependent enzymes and cause side effects. A thermostable alanine racemase (AlrTt) from Thermoanaerobacter tengcongensis MB4 contains an evolutionarily non-conserved residue Gln360 in inner layer of the substrate entryway, which is supposed to be a key determinant in substrate specificity. Here we determined the crystal structure of AlrTt in complex with L-Ala at 2.7 Å resolution, and investigated the role of Gln360 by saturation mutagenesis and kinetic analysis. Compared to typical bacterial alanine racemase, presence of Gln360 and conformational changes of active site residues disrupted the hydrogen bonding interactions necessary for proper PLP immobilization, and decreased both the substrate affinity and turnover number of AlrTt. However, it could be complemented by introduction of hydrophobic amino acids at Gln360, through steric blocking and interactions with a hydrophobic patch near active site pocket. These observations explained the low racemase activity of AlrTt, revealed the essential role of Gln360 in substrate selection, and its preference for hydrophobic amino acids especially Tyr in bacterial alanine racemization. Our work will contribute new insights into the alanine racemization mechanism for antimicrobial drug development."
https://openalex.org/W2285714618,"Background Previous predictions of population morbidity consider demographic changes only. To model future morbidity, however, changes in prevalences of risk factors should be considered. We calculated the number of incident cases of first myocardial infarction (MI) in Mecklenburg-Western Pomerania in 2017 considering the effects of demographic changes and trends in the prevalences of major risk factors simultaneously. Methods Data basis of the analysis were two population-based cohorts of the German Study of Health in Pomerania (SHIP-baseline [1997–2001] and the 5-year follow-up and SHIP-Trend-baseline [2008–2011] respectively). SHIP-baseline data were used to calculate the initial coefficients for major risk factors for MI with a Poisson regression model. The dependent variable was the number of incident cases of MI between SHIP-baseline and SHIP-5-year follow-up. Explanatory variables were sex, age, a validated diagnosis of hypertension and/or diabetes, smoking, waist circumference (WC), increased blood levels of triglycerides (TG) and low-density-lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL), and low blood levels of high-density-lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL). Applying the coefficients determined for SHIP baseline to risk factor prevalences, derived from the new cohort SHIP-Trend together with population forecast data, we calculated the projected number of incident cases of MI in 2017. Results Except for WC and smoking in females, prevalences of risk factors in SHIP-Trend-baseline were lower compared to SHIP-baseline. Based on demographic changes only, the calculated incidence of MI for 2017 compared to the reference year 2006 yields an increase of MI (males: +11.5%, females: +8.0%). However, a decrease of MI (males: -23.7%, females: -17.1%) is shown considering the changes in the prevalences of risk factors in the projection. Conclusions The predicted number of incident cases of MI shows large differences between models with and without considering changes in the prevalences of major risk factors. Hence, the prediction of incident MI should preferably not only be based on demographic changes."
