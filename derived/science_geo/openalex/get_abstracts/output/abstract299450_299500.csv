https://openalex.org/W2004483486,"Current knowledge of the interstellar medium is discussed on the basis of recent published studies. The subjects considered include optical identification of interstellar molecules, radio molecular lines, interstellar clouds, isotopic abundances, formation and disappearance of interstellar molecules, and interstellar probing techniques. Diagrams are plotted for the distribution of galactic sources exhibiting molecular lines, for hydrogen molecule, hydrogen atom and electron abundances due to ionization, for the densities, velocities and temperature of NH3 in the direction of Sagitarius B2, for the lower rotational energy levels of H2CO, and for temporal spectral variations in masing H2O clouds of the radio source W49. Future applications of the maser and of molecular microscopy in this field are visualized."

The development of the lateral meristem was blocked, in general, through inhibition of mitosis, while, concurrently, the growth of certain other plant organs was stimulated in some cases. That higher dosages were required to block vegetattive than floral bud growth suggests that gibberellin also exerts the more specific effect of inhibiting floral initiation."
https://openalex.org/W2025120504,"The infraclass Metatheria has not been reported from deposits predating the mid-Cretaceous. Fossil material just recovered from Albian deposits in northcentral Texas has definite characteristics of the family Didelphidae and is submitted as being from the oldest known marsupials. The same locality has also produced remains referable to Eutheria, demonstrating a somewhat earlier divergence of these two important groups than was known before."
https://openalex.org/W1986759924,The radiogenic argon and helium contents of three basalts erupted into the deep ocean from an active volcano (Kilauea) have been measured. Ages calculated from these measurements increase with sample depth up to 22 million years for lavas deduced to be recent. Caution is urged in applying dates from deep-ocean basalts in studies on ocean-floor spreading.

This is the first occurrence of crystalline iron mineralization in the phylum Porifera and the first indication of hard tissue formation among the Keratosa."

https://openalex.org/W2081263698,"The pattern of deformation in central uplifts of Sierra Madera and other well-known cryptoexplosion structures indicates that inward as well as upward movement of strata formed the uplifts. This kind of movement is incompatible with structures not of impact origin with which they have been compared. The structural style of cryptoexplosion structures, together with features that suggest shock deformation, supports the belief that they are the eroded roots of impact craters."

https://openalex.org/W2017321631,"Shatter cones abound in the central uplift of Sierra Madera and they occur as far as 6.5 kilometers from the center. Apical angles average near 90 degrees. Whole cones and full cones represented by diversely oriented cone segments in any structural block show relatively uniform orientations of axes and a dominant direction of point. The cones predate faulting and folding in the central uplift, and, when beds are restored to horizontal, most cones point inward and upward, a pattern that supports the hypothesis of an impact origin."
https://openalex.org/W2066739263,"Eastern harvest mice, Reithrodontomys humulis humulis (Audubon and Bachman), were tagged with subcutaneously inserted 20 gauge gold-198 wires 10 mm long and varying in activity from 0.7 to 4.5 mc. None of the tags inserted by this method were lost or had any apparent effect on the animals. The movements of the tagged mice were successfully traced with a portable Geiger counter."
https://openalex.org/W2037940867,"The Néel thermal-activation theory of remanence in monodomain grains has been verified quantitatively in experiments on four ferrite micropowders and two natural rocks. Magnetization and demagnetization curves of thermal, isothermal, viscous, and anhysteretic remanences can all be predicted with reasonable accuracy when the Neél theory is generalized to include effects of grain interaction. Results with the natural materials indicate that interacting, single-domain grains or regions are the carriers of the magnetically hard natural remanence of some paleomagnetic rocks."
https://openalex.org/W2049611270,"Infrared images of the lunar eclipse of 13 April 1968 were obtained and compared with infrared images of the 19 December 1964 eclipse. A similarity of apparent strength and distribution of most thermal anomalies on the maria is evident from inspection of these images, indicating that these features are not ephemeral. One new linear thermal anomaly was discovered, which is thermally enhanced during the lunar afternoon. Its close relation to a lunar crustal fracture line and other features of probable internal origin suggests that this anomaly may be of internal origin."

https://openalex.org/W2157371465,Pilots' reports of clear-air turbulence correlate inferentially with sporadic E activity observed by backscatter radar. A cursory survey was made of 19 reports of turbulence between 1 and 20 August 1964 over the western United States; all but three correlate with sporadic E patches.

https://openalex.org/W4247952541,"The two most significant conduits through which scientific advice is channeled to government are the National Academy of Sciences (NAS) and the President's Science Advisory Committee (PSAC). The neutrality of these two bodies has on occasion been called into question by their critics, but seldom from within. In a philosophic but candid interview published in a recent issue of Mosaic, house organ of the National Science Foundation, Edward E. David, the President's science adviser and chairman of PSAC, suggests that the Academy and PSAC may be hindered by their government links from offering scientific advice in an unbiased and credible way."
