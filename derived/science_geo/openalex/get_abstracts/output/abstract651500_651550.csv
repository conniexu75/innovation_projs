https://openalex.org/W3017680297,"SARS-CoV-2 is a betacoronavirus responsible for the COVID-19 pandemic. Although the SARS-CoV-2 genome was reported recently, its transcriptomic architecture is unknown. Utilizing two complementary sequencing techniques, we present a high-resolution map of the SARS-CoV-2 transcriptome and epitranscriptome. DNA nanoball sequencing shows that the transcriptome is highly complex owing to numerous discontinuous transcription events. In addition to the canonical genomic and 9 subgenomic RNAs, SARS-CoV-2 produces transcripts encoding unknown ORFs with fusion, deletion, and/or frameshift. Using nanopore direct RNA sequencing, we further find at least 41 RNA modification sites on viral transcripts, with the most frequent motif, AAGAA. Modified RNAs have shorter poly(A) tails than unmodified RNAs, suggesting a link between the modification and the 3′ tail. Functional investigation of the unknown transcripts and RNA modifications discovered in this study will open new directions to our understanding of the life cycle and pathogenicity of SARS-CoV-2."

Such major viral outbreaks demand early elucidation of taxonomic classification and origin of the virus genomic sequence, for strategic planning, containment, and treatment. This paper identifies an intrinsic COVID-19 virus genomic signature and uses it together with a machine learning-based alignment-free approach for an ultra-fast, scalable, and highly accurate classification of whole COVID-19 virus genomes. The proposed method combines supervised machine learning with digital signal processing (MLDSP) for genome analyses, augmented by a decision tree approach to the machine learning component, and a Spearman’s rank correlation coefficient analysis for result validation. These tools are used to analyze a large dataset of over 5000 unique viral genomic sequences, totalling 61.8 million bp, including the 29 COVID-19 virus sequences available on January 27, 2020. Our results support a hypothesis of a bat origin and classify the COVID-19 virus as Sarbecovirus, within Betacoronavirus. Our method achieves 100% accurate classification of the COVID-19 virus sequences, and discovers the most relevant relationships among over 5000 viral genomes within a few minutes, ab initio, using raw DNA sequence data alone, and without any specialized biological knowledge, training, gene or genome annotations. This suggests that, for novel viral and pathogen genome sequences, this alignment-free whole-genome machine-learning approach can provide a reliable real-time option for taxonomic classification."

https://openalex.org/W3018645360,"Paralyzed muscles can be reanimated following spinal cord injury (SCI) using a brain-computer interface (BCI) to enhance motor function alone. Importantly, the sense of touch is a key component of motor function. Here, we demonstrate that a human participant with a clinically complete SCI can use a BCI to simultaneously reanimate both motor function and the sense of touch, leveraging residual touch signaling from his own hand. In the primary motor cortex (M1), residual subperceptual hand touch signals are simultaneously demultiplexed from ongoing efferent motor intention, enabling intracortically controlled closed-loop sensory feedback. Using the closed-loop demultiplexing BCI almost fully restored the ability to detect object touch and significantly improved several sensorimotor functions. Afferent grip-intensity levels are also decoded from M1, enabling grip reanimation regulated by touch signaling. These results demonstrate that subperceptual neural signals can be decoded from the cortex and transformed into conscious perception, significantly augmenting function."

Inhibition of the epigenetic enzyme enhancer of zeste homolog 2 (EZH2) is both bone anabolic and osteoprotective. EZH2 inhibition stimulates key components of bone-stimulatory signaling pathways, including the BMP2 signaling cascade. Because of high costs and adverse effects associated with BMP2 use, here we investigated whether BMP2 dosing can be reduced by co-treatment with EZH2 inhibitors. Co-administration of BMP2 with the EZH2 inhibitor GSK126 enhanced differentiation of murine (MC3T3) osteoblasts, reflected by increased alkaline phosphatase activity, Alizarin Red staining, and expression of bone-related marker genes (e.g. Bglap and Phospho1). Strikingly, co-treatment with BMP2 (10 ng/ml) and GSK126 (5 μm) was synergistic and was as effective as 50 ng/ml BMP2 at inducing MC3T3 osteoblastogenesis. Similarly, the BMP2–GSK126 co-treatment stimulated osteogenic differentiation of human bone marrow–derived mesenchymal stem/stromal cells, reflected by induction of key osteogenic markers (e.g. Osterix/SP7 and IBSP). A combination of BMP2 (300 ng local) and GSK126 (5 μg local and 5 days of 50 mg/kg systemic) yielded more consistent bone healing than single treatments with either compound in a mouse calvarial critical-sized defect model according to results from μCT, histomorphometry, and surgical grading of qualitative X-rays. We conclude that EZH2 inhibition facilitates BMP2-mediated induction of osteogenic differentiation of progenitor cells and maturation of committed osteoblasts. We propose that epigenetic priming, coupled with bone anabolic agents, enhances osteogenesis and could be leveraged in therapeutic strategies to improve bone mass.

https://openalex.org/W3018434270,"HIV-related stigma has been identified as a significant stressor affecting Quality of Life of Youth Living With HIV/AIDS (YLWHA). Gaining a contextualized understanding of how this stigma is experienced by YLWHA in Western Uganda is crucial in addressing it in this group and setting. In this study, we explored the lived experiences of YLWHA with HIV-related stigma. Photovoice was used to gain insight into the lived experiences of HIV-related stigma in 11 YLWHA (15–19 years), purposively selected from a hospital-based peer support group. Group interview transcripts, notes and photographs were subjected to phenomenological hermeneutic analysis. Encounters with enacted, anticipated and internalized stigmas and their myriad sequels were prevalent in the photos and narratives of participants. Our findings were categorized and presented in 5 main themes that were identified through the analysis: being devalued, experiencing fear, experiencing injustices, feeling lonely, and lacking future perspectives. HIV-related stigmas were experienced in various socio-ecological domains but predominantly in homes and schools that ought to be supportive surroundings for youths. A multilevel approach, targeting the entire society where the root causes of stigma can be found and specific contexts like schools and homes where youth are confronted with stigma on a daily basis is proposed for a wholistic intervention."
https://openalex.org/W3018478389,"Abstract In epithelial ovarian cancer (EOC), response to platinum (PT)-based chemotherapy dictates subsequent treatments and predicts patients’ prognosis. Alternative splicing is often deregulated in human cancers and can be altered by chemotherapy. Whether and how changes in alternative splicing regulation could impact on the response of EOC to PT-based chemotherapy is still not clarified. We identified the splicing factor proline and glutamine rich (SFPQ) as a critical mediator of response to PT in an unbiased functional genomic screening in EOC cells and, using a large cohort of primary and recurrent EOC samples, we observed that it is frequently overexpressed in recurrent PT-treated samples and that its overexpression correlates with PT resistance. At mechanistic level, we show that, under PT treatment, SFPQ, in complex with p54 nrb , binds and regulates the activity of the splicing factor SRSF2. SFPQ/p54 nrb complex decreases SRSF2 binding to caspase-9 RNA, favoring the expression of its alternative spliced antiapoptotic form. As a consequence, SFPQ/p54 nrb protects cells from PT-induced death, eventually contributing to chemoresistance. Overall, our work unveils a previously unreported SFPQ/p54 nrb /SRSF2 pathway that in EOC cells plays a central role in regulating alternative splicing and PT-induced apoptosis and that could result in the design of new possible ways of intervention to overcome PT resistance."

Hypomyelinating leukodystrophies (HLDs) are a group of genetically heterogeneous neurodegenerative diseases characterized by improper myelination of the central nervous system (Charzewska et al., 2016Charzewska A.

HLD10 (MIM: 616420) is caused by homozygous germline loss-of-function mutations in PYCR2 (Meng et al., 2017Meng L. Donti T. Xia F. Niu Z. Al Shamsi A. Hertecant J. Al-Jasmi F. Gibson J.B. Nagakura H.

So far, all 24 patients diagnosed with HLD10 displayed postnatal progressive microcephaly, poor overall growth, and severely delayed psychomotor development. Neuroimaging analyses revealed hypomyelination, a thinner corpus callosum and brain stem, and generalized reduced white matter volume. Pyrroline-5-carboxylate reductase 2 is a mitochondrial enzyme that catalyzes the final step of proline biosynthesis by reducing pyrroline-5-carboxylate (P5C) into L-proline via NADH oxidation. Deficiency in PYCR1, a closely related isoenzyme, leads to a non-overlapping recessive progeroid syndrome characterized by cutis laxa, joint hypermobility, dysmorphic features, and developmental delay (Reversade et al., 2009Reversade B. Escande-Beillard N. Dimopoulou A. Fischer B. Chng S.C. Li Y. Shboul M. Tham P.Y. Kayserili H. Al-Gazali L. et al.Mutations in PYCR1 cause cutis laxa with progeroid features.Nat. Genet. 2009; 41: 1016-1021Crossref PubMed Scopus (170) Google Scholar). Although PYCR1 and PYCR2 are ubiquitously expressed, the exact biological function of PYCR2 in the brain is poorly understood. In vitro studies have shown that loss of PYCR2 leads to decreased mitochondrial potential, defective cell proliferation, and increased susceptibility to apoptosis under oxidative stress (Kuo et al., 2016Kuo M.L. Lee M.B. Tang M. den Besten W. Hu S. Sweredoski M.J. Hess S. Chou C.M. Changou C.A. Su M. et al.PYCR1 and PYCR2 Interact and Collaborate with RRM2B to Protect Cells from Overt Oxidative Stress.Sci.

Genet. 2015; 96: 709-719Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). Surprisingly, plasma metabolomics profiling from affected PYCR2- or PYCR1-mutant patients did not reveal significant perturbations in proline or related metabolites (Meng et al., 2017Meng L. Donti T. Xia F. Niu Z. Al Shamsi A. Hertecant J. Al-Jasmi F. Gibson J.B. Nagakura H. Zhang J. et al.Homozygous variants in pyrroline-5-carboxylate reductase 2 (PYCR2) in patients with progressive microcephaly and hypomyelinating leukodystrophy.Am. J. Med. Genet. A. 2017; 173: 460-470Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar), arguing against proline auxotrophy for these two Mendelian mitochondriopathies. To better comprehend the pathogenesis of HLD10, we sought to model this syndrome in mice by creating the first germline-complete Pycr2 knockout line. Similar to human patients, Pycr2 knockout mice show progressive neurological symptoms with white matter defects, pronounced failure to thrive, and premature death. Using embryonic mouse neural stem cells, we demonstrate that both neurons and oligodendrocytes are affected by loss of PYCR2, which severely lowers endogenous PYCR1 levels. By directly analyzing metabolites related to amino acid biosynthesis and key neurotransmitters in Pycr2 knockout (KO) brains, we document symptoms of an encephalopathy driven by glycine accumulation. This overabundance of cerebral glycine, which is a potent neurotransmitter, could also be documented in PYCR2 mutant patients via magnetic resonance (MR) spectroscopy. Using proximity-based proteomics, we found that SHMT2, the enzyme responsible for glycine synthesis that colocalizes with PYCR1 and PYCR2 in the mitochondria, is significantly upregulated in the absence of PYCR2, accounting for the abnormally high cerebral glycine levels. Last, we provide a proof of concept showing that, by lowering SHMT2, glycine levels are normalized, and the axonal beading and neurite length of Pycr2 KO neurons can be rescued. Together, our results establish that PYCR2 is an essential enzyme for proper mammalian brain development and delineate the glycine metabolic pathway as a potential therapeutic intervention point for PYCR2-deficient patients. Here we report three affected children, born to consanguineous Turkish parents, presenting with failure to thrive, global developmental delay with progressive loss of achieved neuromotor skills, spasticity, myoclonus, seizures, and recurrent episodes of vomiting with onset at 6 months of age (Figure 1A). Evaluation and follow-up of the two affected siblings (III:1 and III:2) and their cousin (III:3) indicated progressive microcephaly (Figure S1A). Head circumferences for patients III:1 and III:2 at 13 and 3.5 years of age, respectively, were below three standard deviations. Brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of proposita III-2 revealed a thin corpus callosum and mildly delayed myelination of the subcortical white matter in all T2 sections (Figure 1B). A combination of homozygosity mapping and whole-exome sequencing revealed a novel germline homozygous pathogenic mutation in PYCR2 (Chr1:c.746G > T, p.Gly249Val) that was never described in the ExAC, UK10K Consortium, or GnomAD databases. Sanger sequencing confirmed that this private mutation segregated with the disease in all available family members (Figure 1C). Consistent with the observed clinical symptoms, we conclude that these three children suffer from recessive HLD10 (MIM: 616420) which has been described previously in patients with PYCR2 deficiency (Meng et al., 2017Meng L. Donti T. Xia F. Niu Z. Al Shamsi A. Hertecant J. Al-Jasmi F. Gibson J.B. Nagakura H.

Abdel-Hamid M.S. Abdel-Salam G. et al.PYCR2 Mutations cause a lethal syndrome of microcephaly and failure to thrive.Ann. Neurol. 2016; 80: 59-70Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). PYCR2 encodes a mitochondrial enzyme that belongs to the family of P5C reductases, whose function is to synthetize L-proline via NADH oxidation (De Ingeniis et al., 2012De Ingeniis J. Ratnikov B. Richardson A.D. Scott D.A. Aza-Blanc P. De S.K. Kazanov M. Pellecchia M. Ronai Z. Osterman A.L. Smith J.W. Functional specialization in proline biosynthesis of melanoma.PLoS ONE. 2012; 7: e45190Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). To assess how this novel missense p.Gly249Val could affect the overall structure and activity of PYCR2, we set out to solve the crystal structure of this enzyme (Table S1). We obtained a 3.4-Å subatomic structure of the apo-enzyme, which is congruent with that of the PYCR1 isoenzyme (Meng et al., 2006Meng Z. Lou Z. Liu Z. Li M. Zhao X. Bartlam M. Rao Z. Crystal structure of human pyrroline-5-carboxylate reductase.J. Mol. Biol. 2006; 359: 1364-1377Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar), where five dimers assembled into a decamer (Figure S1B). This quaternary structure is highly similar to PYCR1, with the C-terminal domains driving most of the contacts to form the hollow “cylindrical” core of the decamer, whereas its N-terminal domains line the periphery of its characteristic yoyo-like structure (Figures S1C and S1D). Notably, the N termini of chains D and E of apo-PYCR2 move away from the core of the decamer complex compared with the NADPH-bound PYCR1 structure (Figure S1C). The residue Gly249 mapped to the PYCR2 dimer interface (Figure 1D), where it makes important contact with the neighboring residues Glu246 and Arg251 (Figure 1E). Its substitution into valine, with a bulkier side chain, is anticipated to weaken the dimer interaction, disrupting PYCR2 stability and function (Figures 1F and 1G). To test this hypothesis, we produced, purified, and compared the enzymatic activity of PYCR2WT and PYCR2G249V. Using an in vitro assay measuring NADH production (Figure 1H), the PYCR2G249V mutant enzyme showed a substantial increase in KM, whereas maximal velocity (Vmax) and kcat were decreased relative to PYCR2WT. These values translated into an overall reduced catalytic efficiency (Figure 1I), indicating that PYCR2G249V enzymatic function is impaired because of loss of NAD affinity and turnover deficiency. To investigate the role played by PYCR2 during brain development in vivo, we generated two mouse Pycr2 KO lines (Figures S2A–S2C). Although we obtained identical phenotypes with both KO lines, most experiments presented were performed with the second allele unless otherwise specified (Figures 2A). Western blot and immunofluorescence studies of primary dermal fibroblasts confirmed that Pycr2−/− mice lack endogenous PYCR2 protein (Figures 2B and 2C). Similar to PYCR2-mutant patients, Pycr2−/− mice were normal at birth but rapidly displayed symptoms of neurodegeneration. From 10 weeks onwards, relative to wild-type or heterozygous littermates, Pycr2−/− mice lost weight, leading to a notable reduction in BMI (Figure 2D). The lifespan of Pycr2−/− mice was also reduced significantly (Figure 2E), consistent with what has been reported for patients with homozygous PYCR2-null mutations (Zaki et al., 2016Zaki M.S. Bhat G. Sultan T. Issa M. Jung H.J. Dikoglu E. Selim L. G Mahmoud I. Abdel-Hamid M.S. Abdel-Salam G. et al.PYCR2 Mutations cause a lethal syndrome of microcephaly and failure to thrive.Ann. Neurol. 2016; 80: 59-70Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). Using a MRI-based morphometric analysis, Pycr2−/− mice showed a trend, although not statistically significant, toward microcephaly, similar to that seen in PYCR2-deficient patients (Figure S2D). A severe abnormal clasping reflex, a typical marker of neurodegeneration, was the first obvious and consistent symptom observed in both Pycr2−/− mice lines (Figures 2F and 2G). A ledge test confirmed that KO mice had impaired balance and motor coordination, which correlated with the ataxia frequently observed in PYCR2-deficient patients (Meng et al., 2017Meng L. Donti T. Xia F. Niu Z. Al Shamsi A. Hertecant J. Al-Jasmi F. Gibson J.B. Nagakura H. Zhang J. et al.Homozygous variants in pyrroline-5-carboxylate reductase 2 (PYCR2) in patients with progressive microcephaly and hypomyelinating leukodystrophy.Am. J. Med. Genet. A. 2017; 173: 460-470Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar; Figure 2H). Furthermore, Pycr2−/− mice displayed early and progressive kyphosis, a common manifestation of neurodegenerative disease often seen in mouse models (Figure S2E). The corpus callosum (CC), the largest white matter structure in the brain, was also significantly reduced in volume in Pycr2 KO mice, reminiscent of what is observed in PYCR2-deficient patients (Figure 2I). In the fetal human brain, PYCR2 mRNA was found to be expressed at a relatively higher level than PYCR1 (Nakayama et al., 2015Nakayama T. Al-Maawali A. El-Quessny M. Rajab A. Khalil S. Stoler J.M. Tan W.H. Nasir R. Schmitz-Abe K. Hill R.S. et al.Mutations in PYCR2, Encoding Pyrroline-5-Carboxylate Reductase 2, Cause Microcephaly and Hypomyelination.Am. J. Hum. Genet. 2015; 96: 709-719Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). We examined endogenous PYCR2 expression in adult mouse brain by measuring the activity of the LacZ knockin reporter or using a validated PYCR2 antibody. Both methods showed that PYCR2 was mainly expressed in the cortex, hippocampus, CC, and cerebellum, whereas it was undetectable in midbrain structures (Figures 2J and S2F). This first KO animal model confirms the importance of PYCR2 during brain development in mammals. Furthermore, it reveals that, for humans and mice, loss of PYCR2 function causes failure to thrive, which worsens with time, leading to premature death. Extensive immunohistochemical and immunofluorescence analyses revealed that the general brain architecture in Pycr2 KO mice was significantly altered compared with control siblings. The levels of endogenous TUJ1, an early neuronal marker, were decreased in the cortical region and hippocampus of 5-month-old Pycr2−/− mice, indicative of neurodegeneration (Figure S3A). Consistent with neuronal maturation defects, a significant reduction in MAP2, which labels differentiated neurons, was observed from 12 weeks onwards in the cortical region of Pycr2−/− mice (Figure 3A). Those anomalies were accompanied by signs of axonopathy, revealed by a significant increase in amyelin precursor protein (APP) (Figure 3B) and synaptophysin (SYN) (Figure S3B), two established markers of axonal damage (Gudi et al., 2017Gudi V. Gai L. Herder V. Tejedor L.S. Kipp M. Amor S. Sühs K.W. Hansmann F. Beineke A. Baumgärtner W. et al.Synaptophysin Is a Reliable Marker for Axonal Damage.J. Neuropathol. Exp. Neurol. 2017; 76: 109-125Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). In parallel, various oligodendroglial lineage markers were assessed in situ to better characterize white matter defects (Figure S3C). Platelet-derived growth factor receptor alpha (PDGFRa), a marker of pre-oligodendrocytes, did not vary in the cortex and CC of Pycr2−/− mice, whereas two markers of mature oligodendrocytes, 2′,3′-cyclic nucleotide 3′-phosphodiesterase (CNPase) and myelin basic protein (MBP), were markedly reduced (Figures S3C and S3D). We also observed a noticeable reduction in the levels of O4, a marker of pre-myelinating oligodendrocytes, and those of MBP in the CC of Pycr2 KO mice (Figure S3D). Quantitative analyses of MBP density in the cortical and CC regions of Pycr2−/− mice revealed no differences at 4 weeks but significant differences at 12 weeks that worsened at 20 weeks (Figures 3C and S3E). The extent of cell death in neuronal and oligodendroglial lineages was assessed using TUNEL labeling (Figures 3D and 3F). Quantitative analyses indicated a substantial number of NeuN- and OLIG2-apoptotic cells at 12 and 20 weeks in Pycr2 KO mice relative to wild-type (WT) littermates (Figures 3E and 3G). Although the ratio of total OLIG2-positive cells, an universal marker of oligodendroglial lineages, did not vary in cortical and CC regions (Figures S3F and S3G), subtracting OLIG2+/TUNEL+ from this total OLIG2+ population showed that OLIG2+/TUNEL− (i.e., viable oligodendrocytes) significantly decreases from 12 to 20 weeks in the Pycr2 KO cortex, whereas it steadily increases in WT brains (Figure 3H). All of these data suggest that the reduction of myelin observed in Pycr2−/− mice is probably due to an oligodendrocyte maturation defect rather than a reduction of the total number of oligodendroglial lineages. These observations are consistent with patent neurodegenerative processes that start postnatally as the brain begins to mature. Unexpectedly, we also observed that endogenous PYCR1, which is readily detectable in cortices from WT mice, was virtually absent in that of Pycr2−/− siblings (Figure S3H). This suggests that neuronal cells lacking PYCR2 cannot compensate by engaging the isoenzyme PYCR1, whose expression or half-life seems to appear to be broadly dependent on that of PYCR2. Taken together, the defects seen in Pycr2−/− mice corroborate the neurological and white matter defects observed in PYCR2 mutant patients, providing a reliable animal model to study the pathogenesis of recessive HLD10. To explore the cause of the neurodegenerative phenotype seen in mice lacking PYCR2, we isolated and propagated primary neural stem cells (NSCs) from WT, Pycr2+/−, and Pycr2−/− mouse embryonic brains at embryonic day 15 (E15). These NSCs were assessed for their ability to expand and differentiate into several lineages. All three multipotent lines expanded similarly under normal culture conditions and were equally affected by proline starvation (Figure 4A). This result indicates that varying the levels of exogenous proline does not exacerbate or rescue the defects associated with PYCR2 deficiency. This is in line with the notion that HLD10 is not a disorder of proline auxotrophy. Because loss of PYCR2 does not reduce the self-renewal of undifferentiated NSCs, we next examined their differentiation potential. Using the proliferative marker proliferating cell nuclear antigen (PCNA), we confirmed that loss of PYCR2 did not impair NSCs’ proliferative capacity and survival throughout differentiation (Figure 4B). All three lines were able to differentiate into neurons, as demonstrated by loss of NESTIN, a marker of NSCs. However, upregulation of TUJ1, a specific neuronal differentiation marker, was notably blunted in Pycr2−/− NSC cultures, whereas it was intermediate in Pycr2+/− cells compared with WT cultures (Figure 4B). This observation led us to postulate that loss of PYCR2 might affect neuronal maturation and/or survival. To test this hypothesis, we further investigated the properties of differentiated Pycr2+/+ and Pycr2−/− neurons. After 1 week in culture, relative to WT or heterozygous neurons, Pycr2−/− differentiated neurons showed thinner neuronal fibers and significantly increased axonal beading, an early and morphological hallmark of neuronal injury (Figure 4C). Consistent with these data, a substantial increase in activated caspase-3 in Pycr2−/− differentiated neurons was documented (Figure S4A). Together, these results demonstrate that Pycr2−/− neurons can reach maturity but have a higher propensity to undergo premature apoptosis. The myelination defects observed in the brain of PYCR2-deficient patients and mice prompted us to examine the differentiation of oligodendrocytes in vitro. For this purpose, NSCs were differentiated into oligodendrocytes (OLGs) according to standard protocols (Figure S4C). We observed a rapid decrease in endogenous PYCR1 levels upon OLG differentiation. This was more pronounced in Pycr2−/− cells (Figure 4D), in line with what was observed in the cortex of the same animals. WT and Pycr2−/− NSCs were similarly able to differentiate into PDGFRa+ pre-OLGs after 7 days of culture (Figure 4D). However, as WT pre-OLGs successfully gave rise to maturing PDGFRa−/O4+ OLGs, Pycr2−/− cell cultures became O4+ but remained PDGFRa+, indicative of incomplete or delayed OLG maturation (Figures 4D and S4D). Consistently, protein kinase B (AKT) phosphorylation increased throughout differentiation in WT but was blunted in Pycr2−/− cultures (Figures 4D and S4B). Compared with WT cells, MBP+ Pycr2 KO cells presented a low number of processes with limited arborization (Figure S4D). Consistent with this observation, fluorescence intensity analyses found few differences in pre-OLG numbers but significantly less immature and mature OLGs in Pycr2−/− cultures (Figure S4E). Upon 7 days of differentiation, OLIG2 levels were slightly decreased in Pycr2−/− cultures, indicating a reduction of total oligodendroglial lineages (Figure S4B). Overall, Pycr2−/− OLGs exhibited a reduced capacity to produce MBP in vitro. OLGs rely on mitochondrial energy to synthesize myelin sheaths. We therefore assessed whether NSCs, differentiated neurons, and OLGs had impaired respiratory capacity. Interestingly, oxidative phosphorylation (OxPhos) was normal in KO NSCs (Figure 4E) and differentiated neurons (Figure S4F) but specifically impaired in Pycr2−/− OLGs compared with WT counterparts (Figure 4F). Basal and maximal respiration rate, ATP production, and spare respiratory capacity were significantly reduced by loss of PYCR2, indicating mitochondrial dysfunction in OLG lineages but not in parental undifferentiated NSCs (Figure 4G). Taken together, our data demonstrate that PYCR2 is not necessary for the maintenance or multi-lineage potency of undifferentiated NSCs but essential for neuronal survival and OLG maturation in vitro. To gain insights into the in vivo pathogenesis of this degenerative microcephaly, we next measured proline-related metabolites directly in the brain of WT and Pycr2 KO animals. Consistent with what has been described previously for PYCR2 mutant patients, we did not detect any proline deficiency in blood or brain tissues of Pycr2−/− mice (Figure 5A). We employed liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry to measure the concentration of various metabolites in regions of the brain where PYCR2 is highly expressed. Analyses of key amino acids that can act as neurotransmitters revealed no changes, with the exception of glycine, which was significantly and robustly increased in all tested brain regions (Figure 5B and S5A). In contrast, circulating glycine levels in the blood of Pycr2−/− mice did not differ from that of WT siblings (Figure S5B). We next sought to replicate this finding in PYCR2-mutant patients. We investigated two previously unreported children, born to consanguineous Egyptian parents, with recessive HLD10 (MIM: 616420) because of a PYCR2 germline homozygous p.Cys232Gly mutation (Figures 5C and 5D). MRI of propositae II-6 and II-7 confirmed cortical atrophy, myelination defects, and thin CCs (Figure 5C). Like in mutant mice, circulating glycine levels were not significantly increased in these two affected individuals (Figure S5C). A non-invasive magnetic resonance spectroscopy (MRS) was performed on these two patients and a healthy volunteer (Figures 5E, S5D, and S5E). A peak of glycine resonating at 3.54 was observed only in PYCR2-mutant patients (Figures 5E and 5F). The cerebral glycine spectrum was distinctly separated from the nearby broader multiplet myo-inositol peak (Figure S5F) and significantly increased in the cortex and cerebellum of the two PYCR2-mutant children relative to the healthy individual (Figure 5G). These results suggest that patients and mice lacking PYCR2 exhibit patent cerebral hyperglycinemia, a hallmark of glycine encephalopathies (Hennermann et al., 2012Hennermann J.B. Berger J.M. Grieben U. Scharer G. Van Hove J.L. Prediction of long-term outcome in glycine encephalopathy: a clinical survey.J. Inherit. Metab. Dis. 2012; 35: 253-261Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). These conditions present with overlapping clinical features, raising the possibility that the overabundance of glycine in HLD10 patients might contribute to disease pathogenesis. To gain mechanistic insights into how glycine levels may rise in the absence of PYCR2, we employed a BirA proximity-based labeling approach to decipher the PYCR1 and PYCR2 interactome (Roux et al., 2013Roux K.J.

We selected PYCR1-BirA as bait because it is a direct interactor of PYCR2 (Kuo et al., 2016Kuo M.L. Lee M.B. Tang M. den Besten W. Hu S. Sweredoski M.J. Hess S. Chou C.M. Changou C.A.

Neurol. 2016; 80: 59-70Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar), and its expression is dependent on PYCR2 in the CNS (Figures S3H and 4D). The robust pull-down of endogenous PYCR1 and PYCR2, among the most abundant biotinylated partners of overexpressed PYCR1-BirA in two distinct human cell lines, confirmed the validity of our proteomics-based approach. Among the 20 most frequently biotinylated proteins, 8 candidates were related to mitochondrial metabolism, including glycine, glutamate, and fatty acid metabolism (Figure 6B). Seven candidates were subunits of complex I (NADH coenzyme Q oxidoreductase), the largest multimeric enzyme complex of the mitochondrial respiratory chain. Notably, serine hydroxymethyltransferase (SHMT2), the rate-limiting mitochondrial enzyme responsible for glycine synthesis, was found among the top 5 pyrroline-5-carboxylate reductase (PYCR) partner candidates. We used western blot and immunohistochemistry assays to examine whether this observation made in cultured cells was also relevant in vivo. Rewardingly, and consistent with the observed elevated cerebral glycine levels, we found that loss of PYCR2 significantly increased endogenous SHMT2 levels in mouse cortices (Figures 6C and 6D) and CC (Figure S6A), two brain regions expressing high endogenous PYCR2 levels. This observation was also confirmed in human primary fibroblasts isolated from PYCR2-mutant patients, where mitochondrial fractions revealed increased SHMT2 levels in the absence of PYCR2 (Figure 6E). The two enzymes co-localized within the mitochondria in WT cells (Figure 6F) but did not co-immunoprecipitate (Figure S6B). By qRT-PCR, we observed that Shmt2 mRNA levels in mouse tissues were significantly upregulated in the absence of Pycr2, suggestive of transcriptional coupling between the proline and glycine metabolic pathways (Figure S6C). We next sought to assess whether increased SHMT2, which correlates with abnormally high cerebral glycine levels, is only a marker, or rather a potential driver, of the neurological defect observed in Pycr2−/− mice. In a first set of experiments, we subjec"

https://openalex.org/W3019607268,"Background Circulating microRNAs (miRNAs) have been shown to dysregulate in many cancer types including hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). The purpose of this study was to examine the potential diagnostic or prognostic roles of circulating miRNAs in patients with hepatitis B virus (HBV)-related HCC. Methods Paired cancerous and adjacent non-cancerous liver tissue specimens of patients with HBV-related HCC were used as a discovery set for screening 800 miRNAs by a Nanostring quantitative assay. Differentially expressed miRNAs were then examined by SYBR green quantitative RT-PCR in a validation cohort of serum samples obtained from 70 patients with HBV-related HCC, 70 HBV patients without HCC and 50 healthy controls. Results The discovery set identified miR-223-3p, miR-199a-5p and miR-451a significantly lower expressed in cancerous tissues compared with non-cancerous tissues. In the validated cohort, circulating miR-223-3p levels were significantly lower in the HCC group compared with the other groups. The combined use of serum alpha-fetoprotein and miR-223-3p displayed high sensitivity for detecting early HCC (85%) and intermediate/advanced stage HCC (100%). Additionally, serum miR-223-3p had a negative correlation with tumor size and BCLC stage. On multivariate analysis, serum miR-223-3p was identified as an independent prognostic factor of overall survival in patients with HCC. In contrast, circulating miRNA-199a-5p and miR-451a did not show any clinical benefit for the diagnosis and prognostic prediction of HCC. Conclusions Our results demonstrated that miR-223-3p was differentially expressed in cancerous compared with paired adjacent non-cancerous tissues. In addition, circulating miRNA-223-3p could represent a novel diagnostic and prognostic marker for patients with HBV-related HCC."

The purpose of this study was to estimate the diagnostic accuracy of the iNPH Radscale in a sample of “true positive” and “true negative” cases. Methods Seventy-five patients with definite iNPH, i.e. who had improved at clinical follow-up one year after ventriculoperitoneal shunt surgery, were compared with 55 asymptomatic individuals from the general population. A radiologist assessed the seven radiological features of the iNPH Radscale in computed tomography of the brain in the patients (preoperatively) and controls. Results The iNPH Radscale score was significantly higher in the iNPH group (Median = 10, interquartile range 9–11) than in the control group (Median = 1, interquartile range 1–2) (p <0.001). Receiver operated characteristics analysis yielded an area under the curve of 99.7%, and an iNPH Radscale score ≤ 4 identified those without iNPH, with a sensitivity of 100%, specificity of 96% and overall accuracy of 98.5%. Conclusions In this study, iNPH Radscale could accurately discriminate between patients with definite iNPH and asymptomatic individuals over 65 years old. According to the results, a diagnosis of iNPH is very likely in patients with an iNPH Radscale score above 8 and corresponding clinical symptoms. On the other hand, the diagnosis should be questioned when the iNPH Radscale score is below the cut-off level of 4. We conclude that the iNPH Radscale could work as a diagnostic screening tool to detect iNPH. Whether the scale also can be used to predict shunt outcome needs further studies."

Although a wide variety of studies are available for larvae rearing, the indoor breeding of adults still presents a great challenge for industrial purposes. This study was designed to assess the simultaneous influence of 3 different light sources (the Mix of LED UV:blue:green 1:1:3, White LED, Neon light) and 3 types of nutrition (sugar and water, only water, no sugar no water) on adult performances, obtaining different egg production parameters that included the number and weight of the egg masses and single eggs laid by the females, the duration of pre-oviposition and oviposition period, the adult life span, the hatchability of the eggs. Our results showed that production parameters are influenced mainly by nutrition rather than light factor, although light plays an important secondary role. Moreover, the presence of sugar positively affects the egg production (12,93-27,10 mg eggs/female) and increases oviposition period (18,2-31,8 days) and adult lifespan (20,79-27,11 days). Light sources also affect egg production parameters, with the exposure to the Mix of LEDs resulting in the best performance of flies. Results obtained from this study are very useful for the design and management of an efficient industrial black soldier fly mass rearing process."
https://openalex.org/W3018279164,"Intimate partner violence (IPV) continues to be a major public health problem globally. Although Ethiopia has a high prevalence of IPV, previous studies in this country have only investigated individual-level determinants of IPV within small geographic areas. The current study aimed to identify the individual-, relationship-, community-, and societal-level determinants of IPV directed against women in Ethiopia since women are predominantly affected. A retrospective analysis of nationally representative data from the 2016 Ethiopian Demographic and Health Survey (EDHS) was conducted. A sample of 3,897 married women of reproductive age (15–49 years) who participated in the domestic violence module of the survey were included in the analysis. Three-level mixed-effects multilevel logistic regression models were used to estimate the individual-, relationship-, community-, and societal-level determinants of IPV. Variability at the community- and societal-level were also assessed. About 1,328 (34.1%) of 3,897 participants reported experiencing IPV (a composite measure of physical, sexual and emotional abuse). In adjusted models, the odds of lifetime IPV experience were higher among women who were older, were married before the age of 18 years, witnessed inter-parental violence during their childhood, had a partner who drank alcohol, and lived in a community with high IPV accepting norms. Alternatively, the odds of IPV were lower among women who had decision-making autonomy in the household, had the same or lower educational attainment as their partner, and lived in a community with low proportions of educated women. These findings reveal that although individual-level factors were significant determinants of IPV, higher level factors, including female education and IPV acceptance in the community, were also important influences on this major public health issue in Ethiopia. These findings suggest combined interventions at different levels may reduce IPV in this country."
https://openalex.org/W3017631069,"Heat shock protein 70 (Hsp70) proteins are a family of ancient and conserved chaperones. Cysteine modifications have been widely detected among different Hsp70 family members in vivo, but their effects on Hsp70 structure and function are unclear. Here, we treated HeLa cells with diamide, which typically induces disulfide bond formation except in the presence of excess GSH, when glutathionylated cysteines predominate. We show that in these cells, HspA1A (hHsp70) undergoes reversible cysteine modifications, including glutathionylation, potentially at all five cysteine residues. In vitro experiments revealed that modification of cysteines in the nucleotide-binding domain of hHsp70 is prevented by nucleotide binding but that Cys-574 and Cys-603, located in the C-terminal α-helical lid of the substrate-binding domain, can undergo glutathionylation in both the presence and absence of nucleotide. We found that glutathionylation of these cysteine residues results in unfolding of the α-helical lid structure. The unfolded region mimics substrate by binding to and blocking the substrate-binding site, thereby promoting intrinsic ATPase activity and competing with binding of external substrates, including heat shock transcription factor 1 (Hsf1). Thus, post-translational modification can alter the structure and regulate the function of hHsp70."

Given that PTEN-induced kinase 1 (PINK1) regulates mitochondrial function, dynamics, and turnover, we hypothesized that alterations in endogenous PINK1 levels contribute to depletion of mitochondria during chronic complex I injury. Here we found that chronic MPP+ treatment of differentiated SH-SY5Y neuronal cells significantly decreases PINK1 expression prior to reductions in other mitochondrial components. Furthermore, Bcl2-associated athanogene 6 (BAG6, BAT3, or Scythe), a protein involved in protein quality control and degradation, was highly up-regulated during the chronic MPP+ treatment.

These results indicate that BAG6 up-regulation during chronic complex I inhibition contributes to mitochondrial pathology by decreasing the levels of endogenous PINK1.

The proper assessment of the patient’s function relies greatly on the repeatability between the measurements. Marker misplacement has been reported as the largest source of variability between measurements and its impact on kinematics is not fully understood. Thus, the purpose of this study was: 1) to evaluate the impact of the misplacement of the lateral femoral epicondyle marker on lower limb kinematics, and 2) evaluate if such impact can be predicted. The kinematic data of 10 children with cerebral palsy and 10 aged-match typical developing children were included. The lateral femoral epicondyle marker was virtually misplaced around its measured position at different magnitudes and directions. The outcome to represent the impact of each marker misplacement on the lower limb was the root mean square deviations between the resultant kinematics from each simulated misplacement and the originally calculated kinematics. Correlation and regression equations were estimated between the root mean square deviation and the magnitude of the misplacement expressed in percentage of leg length. Results indicated that the lower-limb kinematics is highly sensitive to the lateral femoral epicondyle marker misplacement in the anterior-posterior direction. The joint angles most impacted by the anterior-posterior misplacement were the hip internal-external rotation (5.3° per 10 mm), the ankle internal-external rotation (4.4° per 10 mm) and the knee flexion-extension (4.2° per 10 mm). Finally, it was observed that the lower the leg length, the higher the impact of misplacement on kinematics. This impact was predicted by regression equations using the magnitude of misplacement expressed in percentage of leg length. An error below 5° on all joints requires a marker placement repeatability under 1.2% of the leg length. In conclusion, the placement of the lateral femoral epicondyle marker in the antero-posterior direction plays a crucial role on the reliability of gait measurements with the Conventional Gait Model."

A total of 15 dogs with urothelial carcinoma were included. cfDNA concentration was measured using a real-time polymerase chain reaction (PCR) of the LINE-1 gene. To measure the concentration of the mutated BRAF gene in cfDNA, allele-specific real-time PCR with a locked nucleic acid probe was performed. BRAF mutations were detected in 11 (73%) of the 15 tested tumor samples. BRAF-mutated ctDNA concentrations were significantly higher in dogs with the BRAF mutation (14.05 ± 13.51 ng/ml) than in wild-type dogs (0.21 ± 0.41 ng/ml) (p = 0.031). The amount of BRAF-mutated ctDNA in plasma increased with disease progression and responded to treatment.

Photovoltaic solar energy provides benefits in that no emissions are produced; however, there are potential impacts from photovoltaic solar development on birds that include habitat loss and potential for collision mortality. Only 2 papers in the peer-reviewed literature present fatality information from fatality monitoring studies at a photovoltaic utility-scale solar energy facility; however, more data exists in unpublished reports. To provide a more comprehensive overview of bird mortality patterns, we synthesized results from fatality monitoring studies at 10 photovoltaic solar facilities across 13 site-years in California and Nevada. We found variability in the distribution of avian orders and species among and within Bird Conservation Regions, and found that water-obligate birds, which rely on water for take-off and landing, occurred at 90% (9/10) of site-years in the Sonoran and Mojave Deserts Bird Conservation Region. We found that a cause of mortality could not be determined for approximately 61% of intact carcasses, and that approximately 54% of all carcasses were feather spots, introducing uncertainty into the interpretation of the fatality estimates. The average annual fatality estimate we calculated for photovoltaic solar (high-end estimate of 2.49 birds per megawatt per year) is lower than that reported by another study (9.9 birds per megawatt per year) that included one photovoltaic facility. Our results provide a summary of fatalities in bird conservation regions where the facilities are located, but expanding our conclusions to new regions is limited by the location of facilities with fatality monitoring data."
https://openalex.org/W3017484310,"The aim of this study in out-of-hospital cardiac arrest (OHCA) patients treated with targeted temperature management (TTM) was to evaluate the prognostic value of OHCA, C-GRApH, and CAHP scores with initial neurologic examinations for predicting neurologic outcomes.This retrospective study included OHCA patients treated with TTM from 2009 to 2017. We calculated three cardiac arrest (CA)-specific risk scores (OHCA, C-GRApH, and CAHP) at the time of admission. The initial neurologic examination included an evaluation of the Full Outline of UnResponsiveness brainstem reflexes (FOUR_B) and Glasgow Coma Scale motor (GCS_M) scores. The primary outcome was the neurologic outcome at hospital discharge.Of 311 subjects, 99 (31.8%) had a good neurologic outcome at hospital discharge. The OHCA score had an area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUROC) of 0.844 (95% confidence interval (CI): 0.798-0.884), the C-GRApH score had an AUROC of 0.779 (95% CI: 0.728-0.824), and the CAHP score had an AUROC of 0.872 (95% CI: 0.830-0.907). The addition of the FOUR_B or GCS_M score to the OHCA score improved the prediction of poor neurologic outcome (with FOUR_B: AUROC = 0.899, p = 0.001; with GCS_M: AUROC = 0.880, p = 0.004). The results were similar with the C-GRApH and CAHP scores in predicting poor neurologic outcome.This study confirms the good prognostic performance of CA-specific scores to predict neurologic outcomes in OHCA patients treated with TTM. By adding new variables associated with the initial neurologic examinations, the prognoses of neurologic outcomes improved compared to the existing scoring models."
https://openalex.org/W3017890493,"Aim To identify and describe the characteristics of naturally occurring patterns of exercise, sitting in leisure time and at work and cardiorespiratory fitness, and the association of such profiles with metabolic risk factors, perceived health, and perceived symptoms. Methods 64,970 participants (42% women, 18–75 years) participating in an occupational health service screening in 2014–2018 were included. Exercise and sitting were self-reported. Cardiorespiratory fitness was estimated using a submaximal cycle test. Latent profile analysis was used to identify profiles. BMI and blood pressure were assessed through physical examination. Perceived back/neck pain, overall stress, global health, and sleeping problems were self-reported. Results Six profiles based on exercise, sitting in leisure time and at work and cardiorespiratory fitness were identified and labelled; Profile 1 “Inactive, low fit and average sitting in leisure, with less sitting at work”; Profile 2 “Inactive, low fit and sedentary”; Profile 3 “Active and average fit, with less sitting at work”; Profile 4 “Active, average fit and sedentary in leisure, with a sedentary work” (the most common profile, 35% of the population); Profile 5 “Active and fit, with a sedentary work”; Profile 6 “Active and fit, with less sitting at work”. Some pairwise similarities were found between profiles (1 and 2, 3 and 4, 5 and 6), mainly based on similar levels of exercise, leisure time sitting and fitness, which translated into similar dose-response associations with the outcomes. In general, profile 1 and 2 demonstrated most adverse metabolic and perceived health, profile 4 had a more beneficial health than profile 3, as did profile 6 compared to profile 5. Conclusions The present results implies a large variation in exercise, sitting, and fitness when studying naturally occurring patterns, and emphasize the possibility to target exercise, sitting time, and/or fitness in health enhancing promotion intervention and strategies."
https://openalex.org/W3020777891,"Objective Polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) has been associated with an increased risk of metabolic disturbances and cardiovascular disease. Intima-media thickness of the common carotid artery (CIMT) represents a valid surrogate marker of early systemic atherosclerosis. This study aimed to investigate if CIMT is increased in PCOS patients compared to healthy controls and if there is an association with hormone and metabolic profiles. Methods In this prospective cross-sectional study, past medical history, anthropometrical measurements and hormonal, lipidemic and glycemic parameters were obtained in 41 PCOS patients and 43 age-matched healthy controls of similar body mass index (BMI) and frequency of smokers. B-mode ultrasound enabled CIMT measurement at the far wall of the left and right common carotid artery. Results Patients with PCOS showed significantly increased CIMT values compared to healthy controls (0.49±0.04mm vs. 0.37±0.04mm respectively, P<0.001). They featured a generally increased cardiovascular risk profile. Correlation analysis showed a positive association between CIMT and the adverse metabolic risk profile. The diagnosis of PCOS was the strongest predictor of CIMT, even after multiple adjustments for BMI, age and smoking status (β = 0.797, P<0.001, R2 = 0.73). A model among oligomenorrhoic patients revealed a relationship between CIMT and the suspected duration of disease (β = 0.373, P = 0.021, R2 = 0.14). Conclusions PCOS patients are likely to feature signs of premature systemic atherosclerosis at a young age. Early exposure to adverse cardiovascular risk factors may possibly have long-term consequences on the vascular system. An early vessel screening might thus already be beneficial in these patients at a younger age."
https://openalex.org/W3020120155,"Patients diagnosed with polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) are at high risk of developing a myriad of endocrinologic and metabolic derailments. Moreover, PCOS is a leading cause of habitual abortion, also known as recurrent pregnancy loss (RPL). Meteorin-like protein (Metrnl) is a newly discovered adipokine with the potential to counteract the metaflammation. This study aimed at determining the associations of serum Metrnl levels with homocysteine, hs-CRP, and some components of metabolic syndrome in PCOS-RPL and infertile PCOS patients.This case-control study was conducted in 120 PCOS patients (60 PCOS-RPL and 60 infertile) and 60 control. Serum hs-CRP and homocysteine were assessed using commercial kits, while adiponectin, Metrnl, FSH, LH, free testosterone and insulin levels were analyzed using ELISA technique. Serum Metrnl levels were found to be lower in PCOS patients when compared to controls (67.98 ± 26.66 vs. 96.47 ± 28.72 pg/mL, P <0.001)). Furthermore, serum adiponectin levels were lower, while free testosterone, fasting insulin, HOMA-IR, homocysteine, and hs-CRP were significantly higher in PCOS group compared to controls. Moreover, serum Metrnl correlated with BMI, adiponectin, and homocysteine in controls, and inversely correlated with FBG, fasting insulin, and HOMA-IR in PCOS group and subgroups. Besides, it inversely correlated with hs-CRP in control, and PCOS group and subgroups. These findings revealed a possible role of Metrnl in the pathogenesis of PCOS and RPL. Nevertheless, there is a necessity for future studies to prove this concept."
https://openalex.org/W3019461970,"Air pollution with PM2.5 (particulate matter smaller than 2.5 micro-metres in diameter) is a major health hazard in many cities worldwide, but since measuring instruments have traditionally been expensive, monitoring sites are rare and generally show only background concentrations. With the advent of low-cost, wirelessly connected sensors, air quality measurements are increasingly being made in places where many people spend time and pollution is much worse: on streets near traffic. In the interests of enabling members of the public to measure the air that they breathe, we took an open-source approach to designing a device for measuring PM2.5. Parts are relatively cheap, but of good quality and can be easily found in electronics or hardware stores, or on-line. Software is open source and the free LoRaWAN-based “The Things Network” the platform. A number of low-cost sensors we tested had problems, but those selected performed well when co-located with reference-quality instruments. A network of the devices was deployed in an urban centre, yielding valuable data for an extended time. Concentrations of PM2.5 at street level were often ten times worse than at air quality stations. The devices and network offer the opportunity for measurements in locations that concern the public."
https://openalex.org/W3019598444,"Quality assurance and control (QA/QC) is an essential element of a breeding program’s optimization efforts towards increased genetic gains. Due to auto-hexaploid genome complexity, a low-cost marker platform for routine QA/QC in sweetpotato breeding programs is still unavailable. We used 662 parents of the International Potato Center (CIP)’s global breeding program spanning Peru, Uganda, Mozambique and Ghana, to develop a low-density highly informative single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) marker set to be deployed for routine QA/QC. Segregation of the selected 30 SNPs (two SNPs per base chromosome) in a recombined breeding population was evaluated using 282 progeny from some of the parents above. The progeny were replicated from in-vitro, screenhouse and field, and the selected SNP-set was confirmed to identify relatively similar mislabeling error rates as a high density SNP-set of 10,159 markers. Six additional trait-specific markers were added to the selected SNP set from previous quantitative trait loci mapping studies. The 36-SNP set will be deployed for QA/QC in breeding pipelines and in fingerprinting of advanced clones or released varieties to monitor genetic gains in famers’ fields. The study also enabled evaluation of CIP’s global breeding population structure and the effect of some of the most devastating stresses like sweetpotato virus disease on genetic variation management. These results will inform future deployment of genomic selection in sweetpotato."
https://openalex.org/W3018337808,"Maize (Zea mays L) is one of main nutrients sources for humans and animals worldwide. In Africa, storage of maize ensures food resources availability throughout the year. However, it often suffers losses exceeding 20% due to insects such as the larger grain borer, Prostephanus truncatus (Horn) (Coleoptera; Bostrichidae), major pest of stored maize in the tropical countries. This study aims to select resistant varieties to reduce maize storage losses and explain the physicochemical parameters role in grains susceptibility. In the first study, maize grains were artificially infested under no-choice method with insects. Susceptibility parameters such as weight loss, grain damage, number of emerged insects, median development time and susceptibility index varied significantly through maize varieties. Dobie susceptibility index (SI) was assessed as a major indicator of resistance. The most resistant varieties were Early-Thaï, DMR-ES and Tzee-Yellow. Conversely, Synth-9243, Obatampa and Synth-C varieties were susceptible. SWAN, Across-Pool and Tzee-White were classified as moderately resistant varieties. The insect reproductive potential was significantly different in the nine maize varieties and Early-Thaï, DMR-ES and Tzee-Yellow varieties were the least favourable host. To assess the relationship between grains physicochemical characteristics and varietal susceptibility, moisture, total phenolics, palmitic acid, proteins, amylose, density and grain hardness were evaluated according to standardized methods. Palmitic acid, SI, insects emerged and grain damage were significantly and positively correlated with each other, and negatively correlated with grains hardness, phenolics and amylose contents. Maize susceptibility index was significantly and negatively correlated to amylose, and phenolics contents and positively correlated to palmitic acid content. This study identified three resistant maize varieties to P. tuncatus and revealed that the major factors involved in this resistance were hardness, phenolic and amylose contents of grains."
https://openalex.org/W3019974472,"Coffea arabica is a highly traded commodity worldwide, and its plantations are habitat to a wide range of organisms. Coffee farmers are shifting away from traditional shade coffee farms in favor of sun-intensive, higher yield farms, which can impact local biodiversity. Using plant-associated microorganisms in biofertilizers, particularly fungi collected from local forests, to increase crop yields has gained traction among coffee producers. However, the taxonomic and spatial distribution of many fungi in coffee soil, nearby forests and biofertilizers is unknown. We collected soil samples from a sun coffee system, shade coffee system, and nearby forest from Izalco, Sonsonate, El Salvador. At each coffee system, we collected soil from the surface (upper) and 10 cm below the surface (lower), and from the coffee plant drip line (drip line) and the walkway between two plants (walkway). Forest soils were collected from the surface only. We used ITS metabarcoding to characterize fungal communities in soil and in the biofertilizer (applied in both coffee systems), and assigned fungal taxa to functional guilds using FUNGuild. In the sun and shade coffee systems, we found that drip line soil had higher richness in pathotrophs, symbiotrophs, and saprotrophs than walkway soil, suggesting that fungi select for microhabitats closer to coffee plants. Upper and lower soil depths did not differ in fungal richness or composition, which may reflect the shallow root system of Coffea arabica. Soil from shade, sun, and forest had similar numbers of fungal taxa, but differed dramatically in community composition, indicating that local habitat differences drive fungal species sorting among systems. Yet, some fungal taxa were shared among systems, including seven fungal taxa present in the biofertilizer. Understanding the distribution of coffee soil mycobiomes can be used to inform sustainable, ecologically friendly farming practices and identify candidate plant-growth promoting fungi for future studies."
https://openalex.org/W3020440914,"During the periodic moult of the plumage of birds, a fast regrowth of feathers would shorten the time of reduced plumage functionality. However, it has long been known that feather growth-rate is limited and that long feathers take disproportionally longer to grow than small feathers, which has severe consequences on moult duration and the completeness of moult in large birds. The reasons for the limitations of feather-growth must be related to the size and/or functions of the feather follicle, but are largely unknown. Here we measured the size of the feather follicle (taking calamus width as a proxy) and related it to parameters of feather growth (feather growth-rate by mass and by length) and feather structure (feather length, mass, massiveness [mass of feather material per mm feather-length]). We used three independent datasets which allowed for interspecific analyses, and for intraspecific comparisons of differently structured feathers within the framework of biological scaling. We found that the cross-sectional area of the calamus (as a proxy of feather follicle size) was directly proportional to feather growth-rate by mass. Hence, factors acting at a two-dimensional scale (possibly nutrient supply to the growing feather) determines feather growth rate by mass, rather than the linear arrangement of stem cells (in a circular configuration) as had previously been assumed. Feather follicle size was correlated with both feather length and massiveness, hence it seems to be adapted to some extent to feather structure. Feather growth-rate by length was dependent on both the feather material produced per unit time (growth-rate by mass) and the amount of material deposited per unit feather-length. Follicle size not only determines feather growth-rate by mass, but also directly the structural design (shape, number of barbs, etc.) of a feather. Therefore, feather growth-rate is severely constrained by the requirements imposed by the structural feather design."

https://openalex.org/W3018092194,"Hair growth is the cyclically regulated process that is characterized by growing phase (anagen), regression phase (catagen) and resting phase (telogen). Hair follicle stem cells (HFSCs) play pivotal role in the control of hair growth cycle. It has been notified that stem cells have the distinguished metabolic signature compared to differentiated cells, such as the preference to glycolysis rather than mitochondrial respiration. Crif1 is a mitochondrial protein that regulates the synthesis and insertion of oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS) polypeptides to inner membrane of mitochondria. Several studies demonstrate that tissue-specific knockout of Crif1 leads to mitochondrial dysfunction. In this study, we investigated the effect of mitochondrial dysfunction in terms of Crif1 deficiency on the hair growth cycle of adult mice. We created two kinds of inducible conditional knockout (icKO) mice. In epidermal specific icKO mice (Crif1 K14icKO), hair growth cycle was significantly retarded compared to wild type mice. Similarly, HFSC specific icKO mice (Crif1 K15icKO) showed significant retardation of hair growth cycle in depilation-induced anagen model. Interestingly, flow cytometry revealed that HFSC populations were maintained in Crif1 K15icKO mice. These results suggest that mitochondrial function in HFSCs is important for the progression of hair growth cycle, but not for maintenance of HFSCs."

Patients were identified using data from the Ontario Health Insurance Plan Database, and the Ontario Drug Benefit Plan Database. We identified other study variables including all-cause mortality using data from the Registered Persons Database. Encrypted patient identifiers were used to link across databases. Logistic regression models were used to measure potential correlates of deep tissue infections.An increase in the incidence of deep tissue infections was observed between 2011 and 2016 for patients on opioid agonist treatment. Additionally, age, sex, positive HIV diagnosis, and all-cause mortality was correlated with deep tissue infection in our study population.The study indicates factors that are associated with deep tissue infections in the opioid use disorder population and can be used to identify opportunities to reduce the incidence of new infections."
https://openalex.org/W3017697131,"G protein–coupled receptor signaling is required for the navigation of immune cells along chemoattractant gradients. However, chemoattractant receptors may couple to more than one type of heterotrimeric G protein, each of which consists of a Gα, Gβ, and Gγ subunit, making it difficult to delineate the critical signaling pathways. Here, we used knockout mouse models and time-lapse microscopy to elucidate Gα and Gβ subunits contributing to complement C5a receptor-mediated chemotaxis. Complement C5a-mediated chemokinesis and chemotaxis were almost completely abolished in macrophages lacking Gnai2 (encoding Gαi2), consistent with a reduced leukocyte recruitment previously observed in Gnai2−/− mice, whereas cells lacking Gnai3 (Gαi3) exhibited only a slight decrease in cell velocity. Surprisingly, C5a-induced Ca2+ transients and lamellipodial membrane spreading were persistent in Gnai2−/− macrophages. Macrophages lacking both Gnaq (Gαq) and Gna11 (Gα11) or both Gna12 (Gα12) and Gna13 (Gα13) had essentially normal chemotaxis, Ca2+ signaling, and cell spreading, except Gna12/Gna13-deficient macrophages had increased cell velocity and elongated trailing ends. Moreover, Gnaq/Gna11-deficient cells did not respond to purinergic receptor P2Y2 stimulation. Genetic deletion of Gna15 (Gα15) virtually abolished C5a-induced Ca2+ transients, but chemotaxis and cell spreading were preserved.

Gnb2−/− macrophages exhibited robust Ca2+ transients and cell spreading, albeit decreased cell velocity and impaired chemotaxis. In summary, complement C5a-mediated chemotaxis requires Gαi2 and Gβ2, but not Ca2+ signaling, and membrane protrusive activity is promoted by G proteins that deplete phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate.

Leber (Theodor Karl Gustav Leber), using a model of mycotic keratitis, observed the migration of leukocytes to sites of inflammation, where they accumulated in large numbers, reminiscent of the swarming of neutrophils to injured tissue described more recently by Lämmermann et al.

Gradients of chemoattractant ligands emanating from sites of inflammation or injured tissue guide cells by binding to G protein–coupled receptors (GPCRs), but how spatiotemporal ligand-GPCR signaling accomplishes this has not been delineated.

In this study, we used knockout mouse models to explore the roles of different G protein subunits in macrophage chemotaxis. More specifically, we used time-lapse microscopy to visualize the navigation and movement of macrophages, isolated from WT or various knockout mice, in a chemotactic complement C5a gradient, and, in parallel, we imaged the Ca2+ signaling and lamellipodial membrane dynamics in individual cells upon C5aR stimulation. RNA sequence analysis of purified resident peritoneal F4/80+ cells (macrophages) revealed that Gnai2 (Gαi2) and Gnai3 (Gαi3) of the Gαi/o family of Gα-subunits, as well as Gnas (Gαs) and members of the Gαq/Gα11 (Gnaq, Gna11, and Gna15) and Gα12/Gα13 (Gna12 and Gna13) families, are expressed, as well as complement C5a receptor 1 (as known as CD88), encoded by C5ar1 (Fig. 1, A and B). Notably, the controversial C5aR, complement C5a receptor 2 (17Li X.X. Lee J.D. Kemper C. Woodruff T.M. The complement receptor C5aR2: a powerful modulator of innate and adaptive immunity.J. Immunol. 2019; 202 (31160390): 3339-334810.4049/jimmunol.1900371Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar), encoded by C5ar2, was negligibly expressed (see the inset with interrupted y axis in Fig. 1A). We used knockout mouse models to explore the roles of the various Gα and Gβ subunits shown in Fig. 1B, except Gnas (Gαs), in transducing gradients of the chemoattractant complement C5a into stimulated motility (chemokinesis) and directed cell migration (chemotaxis) using the μ-Slide Chemotaxis chamber (16Kronlage M.

Macrophages isolated from WT mice migrated robustly along chemotactic gradients of complement C5a (Fig. 1C and Videos S1 and S2). Incubation with PTX (1 μg/ml), which ADP-ribosylates a serine residue and inhibits Gαi2 and Gαi3 as well as other Gαi/o family members (19Mangmool S. Kurose H.

Similarly, genetic deletion of Gnai2 markedly impaired cell velocity and chemotactic navigation in a complement C5a gradient (Fig. 1 (C and D) and Videos S3–S6), whereas deletion of Gnai3 only marginally impaired cell velocity. The extent of in vitro chemotaxis impairment in Gnai2−/− macrophages was greater than expected when compared with WT versus Gnai2−/− mouse in vivo inflammation models (12Zarbock A. Deem T.L. Burcin T.L. Ley K. Gαi2 is required for chemokine-induced neutrophil arrest.Blood. 2007; 110 (17699741): 3773-377910.1182/blood-2007-06-094565Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar, 13Wiege K.

In the following experiments, we simultaneously imaged intracellular [Ca2+], using the fluorescent Ca2+ indicator Cal-520, and membrane dynamics, assessed by brightfield microscopy (Fig. 2). Macrophages, like neutrophils, migrate on a two-dimensional surface in an amoeboid fashion in which the dominant lamellipodial membrane protrusion steers the cell (22Pollard T.D. Borisy G.G. Cellular motility driven by assembly and disassembly of actin filaments.Cell. 2003; 112 (12600310): 453-46510.1016/S0092-8674(03)00120-XAbstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3160) Google Scholar, 23Lämmermann T.

Huang C.H. Devreotes P.N. Eukaryotic chemotaxis: a network of signaling pathways controls motility, directional sensing, and polarity.Annu. Rev. Biophys. 2010; 39 (20192768): 265-28910.1146/annurev.biophys.093008.131228Crossref PubMed Scopus (356) Google Scholar), as evident, for example, in Video S1. We therefore tested whether complement C5a-induced lamellipodial membrane protrusive activity is defective in Gnai2−/− macrophages. Surprisingly, similar to WT macrophages, complement C5a induced robust monophasic Ca2+ transients and lamellipodial membrane protrusions in the absence of Gnai2 (Fig. 2A and Videos S7 and S8). Deletion of either Gnai2 or Gnai3 did not significantly decrease the peak levels of complement C5a-induced Ca2+ transients or cell spreading, indexed as the peak projected cell area normalized to that preceding stimulation (Fig. 2B). The Ca2+ transient peak, but not peak cell spreading, was decreased by PTX treatment (Fig. 2B). The temporal relation between complement C5a-induced Ca2+ transients and cell spreading suggested that rapid increases in intracellular [Ca2+] may promote branched actin polymerization, which drives lamellipodial membrane extension. To test this notion, we loaded the cytosol of macrophages with the Ca2+ chelator EGTA, using its cell-permeable acetoxymethyl (AM) ester form (EGTA/AM). Intracellular loading of cells with EGTA almost completely abolished complement Ca2+-induced Ca2+ transients (Fig. 3A), but cell spreading was not abrogated (Fig. 3B). This implies that the second messenger Ca2+ is not important for the formation of complement C5a-induced lamellipodial membrane protrusions. Next, we investigated the roles of the Gαq/Gα11 and Gα12/Gα13 families of Gα subunits (schematically illustrated in Fig. 4A) in complement C5a-mediated chemotaxis using triple mutant mice in which one gene is deleted and the second one is conditionally knocked out in myeloid cells, which includes macrophages. The median velocity and chemotaxis index of macrophages isolated from Gnaqfl/fl/LysM-Cre/Gna11−/− (Gnaq/Gna11 dKO (double knockout)) mice, in which Gna11 is constitutively deleted and Gnaq is conditionally deleted, did not differ from the values for WT macrophages (Fig. 4B). Similarly, macrophages isolated from Gna12−/−/Gna13fl/fl/LysM-Cre (Gna12/Gna13 dKO) mice, in which Gna12 is deleted and Gna13 is conditionally deleted, clearly navigated well along chemotactic complement C5a gradients, although the median velocity of Gna12/Gna13 dKO macrophages was modestly increased (Fig. 4, B and C). The polarized morphology of Gnaq/Gna11 dKO macrophages migrating in a complement C5a gradient was unremarkable (Videos S9 and S10), whereas Gna12/Gna13 dKO macrophages exhibited modestly elongated trailing ends (Fig. 4D and Videos S11 and S12), reminiscent of the phenotype of conditional Rhoa knockout macrophages (25Königs V. Jennings R. Vogl T. Horsthemke M. Bachg A.C. Xu Y. Grobe K. Brakebusch C. Schwab A. Bähler M. Knaus U.G. Hanley P.J. Mouse macrophages completely lacking Rho subfamily GTPases (RhoA, RhoB, and RhoC) have severe lamellipodial retraction defects, but robust chemotactic navigation and altered motility.J. Biol.

Jennings R. Vogl T. Horsthemke M. Bachg A.C. Xu Y. Grobe K. Brakebusch C. Schwab A. Bähler M. Knaus U.G. Hanley P.J. Mouse macrophages completely lacking Rho subfamily GTPases (RhoA, RhoB, and RhoC) have severe lamellipodial retraction defects, but robust chemotactic navigation and altered motility.J. Biol.

Measurements of maximal tail length (Fig. 4, D and E), assessed over a 6-h migration period, confirmed that Gna12/Gna13 dKO macrophages developed elongated trailing ends (Fig. 4E). The modest phenotypes of Gna12/Gna13 dKO macrophages suggest that complement C5a coupling to Gα12 and Gα13 contributes to the activation of the Rho subfamily of Rho GTPases and retraction of the trailing end in migrating cells. Consistent with this interpretation, we found that application of complement C5a increased the levels of active RhoA (RhoA-GTP) in WT mouse bone marrow–derived macrophages, measured by G-LISA assays (Fig. 4F). Extracellular UTP and ATP induce large Ca2+ transients in mouse macrophages by binding to P2Y2 receptors (P2Y2Rs), although ATP additionally induces Ca2+ influx via P2X receptors, ATP-gated, nonselective cation channels (20del Rey A. Renigunta V. Dalpke A.H. Leipziger J. Matos J.E. Robaye B. Zuzarte M. Kavelaars A. Hanley P.J. Knock-out mice reveal the contributions of P2Y and P2X receptors to nucleotide-induced Ca2+ signaling in macrophages.J. Biol.

Kaur H. Iring A. Wettschureck N. Offermanns S. Endothelial cation channel PIEZO1 controls blood pressure by mediating flow-induced ATP release.J. Clin.

Offermanns S. Mammalian G proteins and their cell type specific functions.Physiol. Rev. 2005; 85 (16183910): 1159-120410.1152/physrev.00003.2005Crossref PubMed Scopus (766) Google Scholar). Indeed, we found that UTP-induced Ca2+ signaling was almost completely abrogated in Gnaq/Gna11 dKO macrophages, whereas subsequent application of complement C5a induced robust Ca2+ transients (Fig. 5, A and B). Note that the decaying Ca2+ hump following large complement C5a-induced Ca2+ peaks can be explained by store-operated Ca2+ entry because it is absent in Ca2+-free media and can be evoked by reintroduction of Ca2+-containing media (20del Rey A. Renigunta V. Dalpke A.H. Leipziger J. Matos J.E. Robaye B. Zuzarte M. Kavelaars A. Hanley P.J. Knock-out mice reveal the contributions of P2Y and P2X receptors to nucleotide-induced Ca2+ signaling in macrophages.J. Biol.

The large complement C5a-induced Ca2+ peak persists in Ca2+-free media and is produced by endoplasmic reticular (ER) Ca2+ release (20del Rey A. Renigunta V. Dalpke A.H. Leipziger J. Matos J.E. Robaye B. Zuzarte M. Kavelaars A. Hanley P.J. Knock-out mice reveal the contributions of P2Y and P2X receptors to nucleotide-induced Ca2+ signaling in macrophages.J. Biol.

Unlike Gαq and Gα11, which stimulate phospholipase C-β (PLC-β) activity and generate the ER Ca2+-releasing agonist inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate (IP3) via phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate (PIP2) hydrolysis, Gα12 and Gα13 do not stimulate PLC-β, but instead activate Rho guanine nucleotide exchange factors (RhoGEFs). Thus, complement C5a signaling to Gα12 and Gα13 is unlikely to shape the Ca2+ response. Indeed, complement C5a induced robust Ca2+ transients in Gna12/Gna13 dKO macrophages (Fig. 6, A and B). There were no significant differences in the peak Ca2+ responses of Gna12/Gna13 dKO or Gnaq/Gna11 dKO macrophages compared with WT cells (Fig. 6C). Moreover, complement C5a induced lamellipodial membrane spreading in both Gnaq/Gna11 dKO and Gna12/Gna13 dKO macrophages, such that median cell area significantly increased by 1.5-fold (n = 25; three independent experiments) and 1.4-fold (n = 17; two independent experiments), respectively. To determine whether the hematopoietic-restricted α-subunit Gα15, a member of the Gαq/Gα11 family (as illustrated in Fig. 7A), is required for macrophage migration toward complement C5a, we performed real-time chemotaxis assays. Similar to WT cells, Gna15−/− macrophages migrated efficiently along complement C5a gradients (Fig. 7B and Videos S13 and S14), and cells showed normal polarized morphologies in a chemotactic gradient (Fig. 7C and Videos S13 and S14). There were no significant differences in the measured velocity and chemotactic efficiency of WT and Gna15−/− macrophages migrating in a complement C5a gradient (Fig. 7D). Davignon et al. (14Davignon I. Catalina M.D. Smith D. Montgomery J. Swantek J. Croy J. Siegelman M. Wilkie T.M. Normal hematopoiesis and inflammatory responses despite discrete signaling defects in Gα15 knockout mice.Mol. Cell.

In accord with the findings of Davignon et al. (14Davignon I. Catalina M.D. Smith D. Montgomery J. Swantek J. Croy J. Siegelman M. Wilkie T.M. Normal hematopoiesis and inflammatory responses despite discrete signaling defects in Gα15 knockout mice.Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20 (10629036): 797-80410.1128/MCB.20.3.797-804.2000Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar), we found that WT resident peritoneal macrophages produced robust Ca2+ transients upon application of complement C5a, as well as 10 min later following the application of UTP (Fig. 8A), whereas most individual Gna15−/− macrophages did not respond to complement C5a and those that responded gave a weak signal (Fig. 8, B and C). The peak intracellular Ca2+ response to UTP 10 min after complement C5a application was significantly weaker in WT macrophages compared with Gna15−/− macrophages (Fig. 8C). This could possibly be explained as follows. The large cytosolic Ca2+ signal induced by complement C5a in WT cells (which is virtually absent in Gna15−/− cells) causes inactivation of ER Ca2+ release channels (IP3 receptors), which has been shown to occur after ∼30 s in the sustained presence of IP3 (28Foskett J.K. White C. Cheung K.H. Mak D.O. Inositol trisphosphate receptor Ca2+ release channels.Physiol. Rev. 2007; 87 (17429043): 593-65810.1152/physrev.00035.2006Crossref PubMed Scopus (867) Google Scholar). Thus, the weaker response to the second agonist (UTP) probably reflects insufficient resensitization of these channels and/or other factors, such as insufficient time for replenishment of ER Ca2+ stores and membrane PIP2 levels. We next tested whether impaired lamellipodial cell spreading accompanied the loss of Ca2+ signaling in Gna15−/− macrophages. Instead of using transmitted light on the spinning disk confocal microscope to assess membrane dynamics, as in earlier experiments, we used the fluorescent plasma membrane stain CellMask Orange. This fluorophore nicely stained the membrane of macrophages, but it also weakly labeled the surface of fibronectin-coated μ-Slide I chambers (Fig. 9A). Application of complement C5a induced rapid and robust lamellipodial membrane protrusions in WT (Fig. 9A and Video S15) and Gna15−/− macrophages (Fig. 9A and Video S16). Fig. 9A shows snapshots of CellMask Orange recordings, whereas the supporting videos (Videos S15 and S16) show an overlay of fluorescent Cal-520 and CellMask Orange signals. A sharp increase in intracellular [Ca2+] precedes cell spreading in WT macrophages (Video S15), whereas no increase in intracellular [Ca2+] is seen in Gna15−/− macrophages (see the Cal-520 fluorescence intensity trace in Fig. 9A and Video S16). Notably, in Fig. 9A and in the accompanying video (Video S15), the introduction of complement C5a-containing medium to WT macrophages caused a marginal shift of the focal plane in the z axis. Quantification of the images confirmed that complement C5a induced significant increases in projected cell area in both WT and Gna15−/− macrophages (Fig. 9B), and the effects could not be explained by effects of shear stress (Fig. 9C), which typically causes ruffling with minimal net cell spreading. There was no difference, WT versus Gna15−/− macrophages, in the magnitude of complement C5a-induced cell spreading (Fig. 9D). Impaired inflammation-mediated phagocyte recruitment in Gnai2−/− mice (12Zarbock A. Deem T.L. Burcin T.L. Ley K. Gαi2 is required for chemokine-induced neutrophil arrest.Blood. 2007; 110 (17699741): 3773-377910.1182/blood-2007-06-094565Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar, 13Wiege K. Le D.D. Syed S.N.

In addition to the inhibitory effect of Gαi subunits on adenylyl cyclase, the Gβγ subunits released upon activation of members of the Gαi/o family are known to regulate various signal pathways, including PLC-β isoforms, phosphoinositide 3-kinases (PI3Ks), and ion channels (8Wettschureck N.

Covalent modification of lysine residues by electrophilic aldehydes gives rise to formation of heterocyclic structural motifs such as pyrroles, pyridines, and pyrazines. The pyrrole framework is particularly interesting because of its chemical properties and presence in a wide variety of biologically active natural compounds (1Walsh C.T. Garneau-Tsodikova S. Howard-Jones A.R. Biological formation of pyrroles: nature's logic and enzymatic machinery.Nat. Prod. Rep. 2006; 23 (16874387): 517-53110.1039/b605245mCrossref PubMed Scopus (371) Google Scholar). Recently, a covalent modification reaction of proteins, converting lysine residues to Nϵ-pyrrole-l-lysine (pyrK), was discovered by Miyashita et al. (2Miyashita H. Chikazawa M. Otaki N. Hioki Y. Shimozu Y. Nakashima F. Shibata T. Hagihara Y. Maruyama S. Matsumi N. Uchida K. Lysine pyrrolation is a naturally occurring covalent modification involved in the production of DNA mimic proteins.Sci. Rep. 2014; 4 (24938734): 5343Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar). Lysine N-pyrrolation (Fig. 1A) is associated with an increase in net negative charges of proteins because of formation of a lysine charge–neutralizing pyrrole structure. More interestingly, proteins gain electrical conductivity via pyrrolation (2Miyashita H. Chikazawa M. Otaki N. Hioki Y. Shimozu Y. Nakashima F. Shibata T. Hagihara Y. Maruyama S. Matsumi N. Uchida K. Lysine pyrrolation is a naturally occurring covalent modification involved in the production of DNA mimic proteins.Sci. Rep. 2014; 4 (24938734): 5343Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar). The mechanisms underlying these electronic properties have been suggested to be due to stacking interactions between the pyrrole rings and/or between pyrrole ring and aromatic amino acid residues. Because of these properties, pyrrolated proteins have been claimed to be DNA-mimicking molecules. Indeed, it has been shown that DNA-binding molecules, such as anti-DNA autoantibodies and DNA intercalators, recognize pyrrolated proteins and that immunization of mice with pyrrolated proteins triggers enhanced production of anti-DNA autoantibodies (2Miyashita H.

Using a highly sensitive and specific LC-MS/MS–based method, pyrK has been detected in immune complex deposits in kidneys of mice (2Miyashita H. Chikazawa M. Otaki N. Hioki Y. Shimozu Y. Nakashima F.

In addition, significantly elevated levels of serum pyrrolated proteins compared with normal control individuals have also been demonstrated. These findings support our proposition that lysine N-pyrrolation in proteins, generating pyrK, occurs in vivo and provide a link connecting lysine N-pyrrolation and lipoprotein metabolism. However, the key question is what mediates N-pyrrolation. 1,4-Butanedial (BDA), a Paal–Knorr reagent, can readily convert lysine to pyrK, but it is not a physiological molecule. Several studies have shown that conversion of primary amino groups into pyrrole derivatives occurs upon reaction of lysine residues of proteins with the reactive species that originated from the lipid peroxidation reactions. They are mostly aldehydes, such as 4-hydroxy-2-nonenal (4Sayre L.M. Arora P.K. Iyer R.S. Salomon R.G. Pyrrole formation from 4-hydroxynonenal and primary amines.Chem. Res.

In our previous study, we demonstrated that oxidative modification of LDL, generating a number of lipid peroxidation-derived aldehydes, was accompanied by an increase in binding potential of the oxidized LDL with a DNA intercalator. Based on these observations, we tentatively concluded that pyrK was being formed from a product of oxidation of the lipid component of LDL (2Miyashita H. Chikazawa M. Otaki N. Hioki Y. Shimozu Y. Nakashima F. Shibata T. Hagihara Y. Maruyama S. Matsumi N. Uchida K. Lysine pyrrolation is a naturally occurring covalent modification involved in the production of DNA mimic proteins.Sci. Rep. 2014; 4 (24938734): 5343Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar). Moreover, given the structure of the pyrrole ring in pyrK, the most likely candidates were anticipated to be short-chain aldehydes, especially C2 and/or C4 aldehydes. To understand the potential physiological and pathophysiological significance of lysine N-pyrrolation, we initiated studies to identify pyrrolating agent(s) from in vitro peroxidized polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs) and unequivocally identified a C2 aldehyde, glycolaldehyde (GA), as a source of pyrK. We also characterized the mechanism of GA-mediated lysine N-pyrrolation and suggest that the reaction might require oxidation of GA. Following identification of GA as an active substance, we examined the interaction between GA-modified proteins and apoE, a binding target of pyrrolated proteins. We also generated several monoclonal antibodies from mice immunized with GA-modified proteins and revealed their specificity toward pyrrolated proteins. Our findings uncovered a novel function of GA as an endogenous source of DNA-mimicking pyrrolated proteins and suggest that GA-derived pyrK residues generated in proteins may play a role in innate and autoimmune responses associated with glucose metabolism and oxidative stress. To obtain direct evidence of the occurrence of lysine N-pyrrolation in oxidized LDL, we analyzed pyrK in Cu2+-oxidized LDL using LC-ESI-MS/MS coupled with a stable isotope dilution method. When isolated human plasma LDL (0.5 mg/ml) was incubated at 37 °C with Cu2+ (5 μm), the yield of pyrK in low-density lipoproteins increased in a time-dependent manner (Fig. 1B). The yield of the adduct was 0.53 mol/1 mol of LDL after 24 h of incubation. The data strongly suggest that lipid peroxidation is involved in formation of pyrK in oxidized LDL. Then, based on the fact that pyrrolated proteins act as DNA mimics recognized by SYBR Green I (SG), we carried out activity-guided separation of oxidized fatty acids upon production of SG–binding proteins. Oxidized PUFAs (EPA and DHA) were separated into aqueous and organic fractions and determined for production of SG-stainable proteins upon incubation with BSA at 37 °C for 48 h. Proteins incubated with the aqueous fractions of the oxidized PUFAs were recognized by SG, whereas the organic fractions barely produced SG-stainable proteins (Fig. 1C). The data obtained from these in vitro experiments suggest that a physiologically relevant metabolite of fatty acids might be involved in formation of pyrK. To identify the oxidized lipid(s) responsible for formation of pyrK in the protein, the aqueous fractions of oxidized EPA and DHA were separated and fractionated every 1 min by reverse-phase HPLC. Aliquots of each fraction were then incubated with BSA in 50 mm phosphate buffer (pH 7.2) at 37 °C for 4 days, and their activities regarding production of SG-binding proteins were evaluated. It appeared that multiple fractions in oxidized EPA and DHA could generate SG-stainable proteins (Fig. 2). We tested these fractions for formation of pyrK upon incubation with BSA and observed that only fraction 4 commonly produced pyrK. The data suggest that the same molecule originating from both PUFAs might be involved in production of pyrK. Peroxidation of PUFAs produces complex breakdown products, including alcohols, aldehydes, ketones, and ethers. We speculated that the most likely sources of pyrK might be aldehydes. Hence, fraction 4 from oxidized EPA and DHA was incubated with 2,4-dinitrophenylhydrazine (DNPH) and analyzed by reverse-phase HPLC. As shown in Fig. 3A, the fractions gave the same product (indicated by arrows). To identify the putative pyrrolating agent, the DNPH derivatives of fraction 4 from oxidized EPA and DHA were further analyzed by LC-ESI-MS. Each fraction gave two common peaks (peaks a and b from oxidized EPA and peaks c and d from oxidized DPA) at 4.6 min and 4.9 min (Fig. 3, B and C). Peaks a (Fig. 3B, center panel) and c (Fig. 3C, center panel) showed an [M-H]− peak at m/z 197 corresponding to the m/z of the unreacted DNPH. Peaks b (Fig. 3B, bottom panel) and d (Fig. 3C, bottom panel) gave the same [M-H]− ion at m/z 239, which was expected to be the DNPH derivative of the putative pyrrolating agent that originated from the PUFAs. Because DNPH derivatization of an aldehyde is an addition reaction followed by dehydration, the original pyrrolating agent was expected to have a molecular mass of 60 Da. Considering that it has an aldehyde moiety that originated from lipid peroxidation, the most likely structure of this product was GA (Fig. 3D). The DNPH derivative of the authentic GA (Fig. 3E) indeed gave the same fragmentation pattern as the products that originated from the oxidized PUFAs (Fig. 3, B and C). In addition, we also confirmed that authentic GA chromatographed with the activity in fraction 4. Using the stable isotope dilution–based LC-ESI-MS/MS method, we confirmed that a significant amount of GA could be generated during peroxidation of the PUFAs (Fig. S1 and Fig. 4). Thus, GA appeared to be a putative pyrrolating agent generated during peroxidation of the PUFAs. To establish that GA could mediate lysine N-pyrrolation in proteins, we examined production of SG-stainable DNA mimic proteins and pyrK upon incubation of GA with BSA. As shown in Fig. 5, A and B, GA indeed produced modified proteins that could be recognized by the DNA intercalator. The GA-modified proteins also showed significant cross-reactivity with an anti-DNA IgM mAb, ADL19 (Fig. 5C). In parallel with production of DNA mimic proteins, a significant amount of pyrK was detected in GA-modified proteins (Fig. 5D). Thus, GA was identified as the first endogenous metabolite that could mediate lysine N-pyrrolation. To examine whether any other endogenous metabolites could be involved in lysine N-pyrrolation, we tested several carbohydrates and their related metabolites with a chain length between two and four carbon atoms. We also tested C5 and C6 reducing sugars that could serve as their precursors. As shown in Fig. 6A, in addition to GA, glycolytic intermediates, such as glyceraldehyde and methylglyoxal, generated DNA-mimicking SG-stainable proteins. In addition, the SG-binding potency of these modified proteins correlated well with their ability to bind to the anti-DNA IgM mAb ADL19 (Fig. 6B). Thus, glyceraldehyde and methylglyoxal, in addition to GA, were tentatively identified as the most likely candidates of physiological pyrrolating agents. To determine whether the SG-binding potency could be ascribed to N-pyrrolation of lysine residues, we measured pyrK in modified proteins using LC-ESI-MS/MS coupled with a stable isotope dilution method. Interestingly, pyrK was primarily detected in protein modified with GA (Fig. 6C). The pyrrolated lysine was also generated by glyceraldehyde, which was far less efficient than GA. We also examined conversion of Nα-acetyl-lysine (NAK) to Nα-acetyl-pyrK (pyrNAK) and observed that lysine N-pyrrolation was mediated by GA (Fig. 6D). Despite significant SG-binding potency, methylglyoxal was hardly involved in formation of pyrK upon incubation with the protein and the lysine derivative. It is likely that methylglyoxal may generate a pyrK-like adduct, which might contribute to recognition of modified proteins by SG. Lysine N-pyrrolation by GA may be explained by a mechanism involving formation of a Schiff base derivative as the first intermediate. The Schiff base further reacts with a second GA molecule to generate an imine derivative, which is subsequently converted to the final product (pyrK). Theoretically, conversion of this imine derivative to the final product (pyrK) requires one oxidation step and intramolecular cyclization. Indeed, pyrK formation upon incubation of NAK with GA was enhanced by addition of metal ions such as copper and iron ions (Fig. 7A). The data suggest involvement of oxidation of a GA–lysine intermediate and/or oxidation of GA itself. In this regard, based on the previous finding that GA can be easily oxidized to glyoxal (11Glomb M.A. Monnier V.M. Mechanism of protein modification by glyoxal and glycolaldehyde, reactive intermediates of the Maillard reaction.J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270 (7730303): 10017-1002610.1074/jbc.270.17.10017Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (502) Google Scholar), we examined whether oxidized GA could mediate lysine N-pyrrolation upon incubation with NAK. pyrNAK was barely produced by glyoxal alone; however, pyrrolation was dramatically accelerated by combination of GA and glyoxal (Fig. 7B). Thus, oxidative conversion of GA to glyoxal may, at least in part, be involved in lysine N-pyrrolation by GA (Fig. 7C). Fig. 8 depicts a proposed mechanism for formation of pyrK involving GA and glyoxal. The mechanism may include two sets of nucleophilic addition reactions, i.e. between a primary amino group of the lysine residue and GA and between a secondary amine derivative (Amadori product) and glyoxal.Figure 8Proposed mechanism for formation of pyrK upon reaction of the lysine amino group with GA.

Hence, to determine whether GA-modified proteins could show affinity for serum proteins, including apoE, normal mouse serum was incubated with beads coupled to native BSA and GA-modified BSA (GA-BSA). We used two GA-BSA ligands that differ depending on the incubation period (1 and 7 days). The bound proteins were eluted and separated by SDS-PAGE under reducing conditions (Fig. 9A). Several unique bands were detected in pulldown with the GA-BSA ligands (Tables S1–S7). Among them, a protein with a molecular mass of about 35 kDa (Fig. 9A, band 6) that was pulled down by GA-BSA was identified as apoE by LC-MS/MS analysis. Another six proteins (Fig. 9A, bands 1–5 and 7) were also identified: i.e. thrombospondin 1 (Fig. 9A, band 1), complement factor H–related protein C (Fig. 9A, band 2), coagulation factor XIII A chain (Fig. 9A, band 3), serotransferrin (Fig. 9A, band 4), antithrombin (Fig. 9A, band 5), and metalloproteinase inhibitor 3 (Fig. 9A, band 7). Immunoblot analysis confirmed that GA-BSA could bind to apoE (Fig. 9B). The solid-phase binding and pulldown assays showed that GA-BSA and GA-PA were almost equally recognized by the three apoE isoforms (Fig. 9, C and D). Based on binding of apoE to GA-modified proteins, we examined the changes in antibody response to GA-modified proteins in sera from male control and apoE-deficient hyperlipidemia mice. As shown in Fig. 9E, there was an increased tendency for the serum IgG and IgM titers to GA-BSA and BDA-BSA in apoE-deficient mice compared with control mice. Of interest, the levels of the anti-GA-BSA titers were notably higher than those of the anti-BDA-BSA titers in control and hyperlipidemia mice. Thus, these data suggest that the impaired lipid and lipoprotein metabolism caused by apoE deficiency may accelerate the immune response, leading to overproduction of these antibodies against GA-specific epitopes, including pyrK. Given the significant increase in serum levels of antibodies against GA-specific epitopes in apoE-deficient mice, we evaluated the changes in immune response in BALB/c mice after immunization with GA-modified proteins. The mice were immunized every 2 weeks with GA-modified keyhole limpet hemocyanin (GA-KLH), and the IgG and IgM responses to the antigens, including control BSA, GA-BSA, and BDA-BSA (pyrrolated BSA), were examined. As shown in Fig. 10A, mice immunized with GA-KLH displayed significant IgM responses to GA-BSA and pyrrolated BSA. However, only a low IgG response to pyrrolated proteins was observed. To gain more insight into the immune response to GA-modified proteins, we established three hybridoma clones (GAK1, GAK2, and GAK3) producing mAbs that recognize GA-BSA from GA-KLH–immunized mice (Fig. 10B). GAK1 and GAK2 produced IgG, whereas GAK3 produced IgM. The IgG mAb GAK1 cross-reacted specifically with GA-BSA and glyceraldehyde-modified BSA but did not display detectable binding with pyrrolated proteins. The IgG mAb GAK2 also cross-reacted with the GA-BSA and glyceraldehyde-BSA more prominently than with pyrrolated proteins. However, the IgM mAb GAK3 was rather specific to pyrrolated proteins. In fact, binding of IgM mAb to GA-modified proteins was inhibited by pyrrolated proteins in a dose-dependent manner (Fig. 10C), suggesting that the IgM mAb may have specificity toward an epitope such as pyrK. Endogenous reactive species such as oxidized fatty acids and intermediates of glycolysis mediate covalent modification of proteins under physiological conditions. The ϵ-amino group of lysine is one of the targets of modification and has a major effect on the chemical properties of proteins, leading to important functional and regulatory consequences. Lysine N-pyrrolation, converting lysine residues to pyrK, is associated with an increased negative charge because of neutralization of the lysine residues and with conferring electrochemical properties onto proteins that potentially produce an electrical mimic to DNA (2Miyashita H. Chikazawa M. Otaki N. Hioki Y. Shimozu Y. Nakashima F. Shibata T. Hagihara Y. Maruyama S. Matsumi N. Uchida K.

This finding strongly suggests that a physiologically relevant molecule might be involved in lysine N-pyrrolation. However, until now, the endogenous source of pyrrolation was unknown. In this study, based on detection of pyrK in oxidized LDL, we focused our attention on lipid peroxidation and identified the simplest hydroxyaldehyde, GA, as a source of lysine N-pyrrolation. The presence of an endogenous pyrrolating factor is thought to be an important indication that the processes leading to formation of pyrrolated proteins can take place under physiological conditions. GA can be enzymatically formed from fructose 1,6-bisphosphate as catalyzed by ketolase in an alternate glycolysis pathway. It is also a common intermediate generated through several nonenzymatic reactions, such as peroxidation of PUFAs (12Onyango A.N.

GA produced from activated macrophages and neutrophils has been reported to play an important role in generation of an active ligand for the macrophage scavenger receptor. Because of the presence of multiple sources for GA in vivo, it is still difficult to discern the primary source of GA involved in lysine N-pyrrolation in complex biological matrices. However, identification of GA as a physiological pyrrolating factor may emphasize the significance of GA metabolism in biological systems and may provide additional insight into the etiologic role of this glycolytic product in the pathogenesis of chronic inflammatory diseases. GA has facile reactivity with biological materials, including proteins, and has been implicated in the pathogenesis of vascular diseases such as atherosclerosis and renal disorders (14Greven W.L.

Isolates from Todos Santos Bay were cultivated under conditions of phosphate sufficiency and deficiency at 16°C and 22°C to evaluate the production of DA. This toxin was detected in the particulate (DAp) and dissolved (DAd) fractions of the cultures during the exponential and stationary phases of growth of the cultures. The highest DA concentration was detected during the exponential phase grown in cells maintained in P-deficient medium at 16°C (1.14 ± 0.08 ng mL-1 DAd and 4.71 ± 1.11 × 10-5 ng cell-1 of DAp). In P-sufficient cultures DA was higher in cells maintained at 16°C (0.25 ± 0.05 ng mL-1 DAd and 9.41 ± 1.23 × 10-7 ng cell-1 of DAp) than in cells cultured at 22°C. Therefore, we confirm that P. subpacifica can produce DA, especially under P-limited conditions that could be associated with extraordinary oceanographic events such as the 2013-2016 ""Blob"" in the northeastern Pacific Ocean.

https://openalex.org/W3020720373,"Background Accurate radiation dose estimates are critical for determining eligibility for therapies by timely triaging of exposed individuals after large-scale radiation events. However, the universal assessment of a large population subjected to a nuclear spill incident or detonation is not feasible. Even with high-throughput dosimetry analysis, test volumes far exceed the capacities of first responders to measure radiation exposures directly, or to acquire and process samples for follow-on biodosimetry testing. Aim To significantly reduce data acquisition and processing requirements for triaging of treatment-eligible exposures in population-scale radiation incidents. Methods Physical radiation plumes modelled nuclear detonation scenarios of simulated exposures at 22 US locations. Models assumed only location of the epicenter and historical, prevailing wind directions/speeds. The spatial boundaries of graduated radiation exposures were determined by targeted, multistep geostatistical analysis of small population samples. Initially, locations proximate to these sites were randomly sampled (generally 0.1% of population). Empirical Bayesian kriging established radiation dose contour levels circumscribing these sites. Densification of each plume identified critical locations for additional sampling. After repeated kriging and densification, overlapping grids between each pair of contours of successive plumes were compared based on their diagonal Bray-Curtis distances and root-mean-square deviations, which provided criteria (<10% difference) to discontinue sampling. Results/Conclusions We modeled 30 scenarios, including 22 urban/high-density and 2 rural/low-density scenarios under various weather conditions. Multiple (3–10) rounds of sampling and kriging were required for the dosimetry maps to converge, requiring between 58 and 347 samples for different scenarios. On average, 70±10% of locations where populations are expected to receive an exposure ≥2Gy were identified. Under sub-optimal sampling conditions, the number of iterations and samples were increased, and accuracy was reduced. Geostatistical mapping limits the number of required dose assessments, the time required, and radiation exposure to first responders. Geostatistical analysis will expedite triaging of acute radiation exposure in population-scale nuclear events."

The school environment factors were assessed using a set of validated whole-school environmental mapping questionnaires, consisting of 76 criteria with four domains; physical environment (41 criteria), economic environment (nine criteria), political environment (nine criteria) and sociocultural environment (17 criteria). This involved face-to-face interview sessions with 32 teachers from 16 schools (eight rural and eight urban). In addition, 400 school children aged between 9 and 11 years of the selected schools were assessed for BMI (WHO 2007 reference chart), dietary intake (food frequency questionnaire (FFQ)) and physical activity level (physical activity questionnaire for children (PAQ-C)). Multiple regression was used to examine the association between school environment factors and BMI of the school children. Seven school environment criteria were found to be associated with BMI of school children when it was adjusted for calorie intake and physical activity level. About 33.4% of the variation in BMI of school children was explained by health professional involvement, simple exercise before class, encouragement to walk/ride bicycle to/from school, no high-calorie food sold, healthy options of foods and drinks at tuck shop, availability of policy on physical activity and training teacher as a role model.

Regulation of total ghrelin concentration following food stimulation is highly individual and responders showed upregulated total ghrelin, while the concentration of active ghrelin decreases following a meal. Protein content and colour intensity of food pictures reversely correlated with participants’ rating of the pictures. We conclude that observation of food pictures influences the concentration of several appetite-related hormones. The close link of visual clues to physiological responses is likely of clinical relevance. Additionally, the protein content of displayed foods and green colour intensity in pictures may serve as a predictor of subjective attractiveness of the presented meal."
https://openalex.org/W3019335877,"Previous research suggests that the size of one’s body is used as a metric to scale the external world. On the other hand, the influence of information from the external world on the perception of body size is unclear. It has been suggested that increased inter-pupillary distance (IPD) leads people to perceive the external world as smaller than it actually is. The present study investigated the effect of the IPD on body size perception, and the relationship between the perceived scale of the body and the external world when the IPD is manipulated. To this end, in a virtual environment, we manipulated the IPD as well as the size and presence of participants’ hands, while participant’s eye height was increased vertically. Results showed that, when participants’ eye height was increased and their hands were enlarged, people with a fixed IPD perceived the size of their body to be large (like a giant) while the external world was perceived to be changed minimally. Alternatively, people with increased IPD perceived that the external world as having shrank, whereas their perception of their body size changed little. However, when a viewers’ virtual hands were not shown, the IPD did not affect the individual’s percept of body size, although the IPD did affect one’s perception of the external world. These results suggest that, when the ratio of the size between one’s body and the external world are explicit, the perceived size of one’s body is affected by the IPD or perceived scale of the external world that is affected by the IPD."
https://openalex.org/W3018479745,"Countermeasures to reduce radiocesium (134Cs and 137Cs) uptake by crops have been implemented in farmlands affected by the Fukushima nuclear accident in 2011. A widely practiced countermeasure is the application of potassium (K). Long-term soil K maintenance is a key issue due to the long physical half-life of 137Cs (30 years). Information on input and output pathways determining plant-available K budgets can provide a base for the development of maintenance strategies. Therefore, in this study we evaluated these pathways in paddy fields subjected to K fertilization as a countermeasure. We selected two fields with different soil textures and drainage conditions and quantified input and output via fertilization, irrigation, precipitation, straw return to soil, plant harvesting, surface runoff, and percolation during the cropping period in 2018. The major input pathways were fertilization, straw return, and irrigation due to a large inflow volume with spill-over irrigation. The major output pathways consisted of plant harvesting, surface runoff, and percolation. However, 85% of K in harvested plants was brought back by straw return; in practice, harvesting was a minor pathway. The K budgets during the study period were negative (-20 and -289 kg ha-1) and especially severe in clay loam soil with high output via percolation. This could probably be attributed to the low cation exchange capacity and high permeability from the low total C and clay contents. Losses via surface runoff stemmed from excessive irrigation volumes in both fields. Around 70% of the total K output via surface runoff and percolation was discharged before mid-summer drainage. Accordingly, controlling the irrigation volume during this period in addition to increasing cation exchange capacity and decreasing permeability may improve the negative budgets."
https://openalex.org/W3020547489,"Idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) is a chronic and progressive lung disease. Chronic idiopathic interstitial pneumonia (c-IIP) is a group of lung diseases consisting mainly of fibrotic IIPs, and IPF is a type of c-IIP. Some patients with c-IIP undergo respiratory-related hospitalizations (RHs). With the hypothesis that the characteristics of patients who undergo RHs are related to the number of hospitalizations, we reviewed and investigated the RHs of patients with c-IIP.We retrospectively examined the data of patients with c-IIP who were admitted to Kindai University Hospital between January 2008 and December 2018 for respiratory-related causes.During the study period, 243 patients with c-IIP were hospitalized a total of 544 times because of respiratory-related causes. The most common reasons for the first RH were acute exacerbation (48.1%) followed by pulmonary infection (32.5%). The most frequent reason for subsequent RHs was pulmonary infection. The in-hospital and 90-day mortality rate of patients with pulmonary infection increased with increasing numbers of RHs. Patients with multiple RHs had significantly worse long-term survival than patients hospitalized a single time.Pulmonary infection was the most frequent reason for repeated RHs. The proportion of all patients hospitalized for pulmonary infection at each RH increased with increasing numbers of RHs, along with the mortality rate of patients with pulmonary infections. Furthermore, repeated RHs were associated with poor survival."
https://openalex.org/W3018274567,"Background Hospital-Acquired Infections (HAIs) are acquired when the patient is hospitalized for more than 48 hours. In Ethiopia data are scarce in management appropriateness of HAIs. Hence, this study was aimed to assess the prevalence and management of HAIs among patients admitted at Zewditu Memorial Hospital. Method A facility based prospective cross sectional study was conducted from March 1, 2017 to August 30, 2017. The sample was proportionally allocated among (medical, pediatrics, gynecology and obstetrics and surgical) wards, based on patient flow. Data were collected using data abstraction format and supplemented by key informant interview. Interview was made on eight physicians and four microbiologists who have been working in the wards during study period. Management appropriateness was assessed using Infectious Disease Society of America guideline and experts opinion (Infectious disease specialist). A multivariate logistic regression was used to identify factors associated with HAIs. Result The prevalence of HAIs was 19.8%. Surgical Site Infection (SSI) and pneumonia accounted for 20 (24.7%) of the infections. Culture and sensitivity was done for 24 (29.6%) patients. Of the 81 patients who developed HAIs, 54 (66.67%) of them were treated inappropriately. Physicians’ response for this variation was information gap, forgetfulness, affordability and availability issue of first line medications. Younger age (AOR (Adjusted odds ratio) = 8.53, 95% CI: 2.67–27.30); male gender (AOR = 2.06, 95% CI: 1.01–4.22); longer hospital stay (AOR = 0.17, 95% CI: 0.06–0.51); and previous hospital admission (AOR = 3.22, 95% CI: 1.76–5.89); were independent predictors of HAIs. Conclusion Prevalence of HAIs and inappropriate management were substantially high in this study. Pneumonia and SSI were the common types of HAIs. Locally conformable guidelines could help to correct such problems."
https://openalex.org/W3018833570,"A common approach to improving probabilistic forecasts is to identify and leverage the forecasts from experts in the crowd based on forecasters' performance on prior questions with known outcomes. However, such information is often unavailable to decision-makers on many forecasting problems, and thus it can be difficult to identify and leverage expertise. In the current paper, we propose a novel algorithm for aggregating probabilistic forecasts using forecasters' meta-predictions about what other forecasters will predict. We test the performance of an extremised version of our algorithm against current forecasting approaches in the literature and show that our algorithm significantly outperforms all other approaches on a large collection of 500 binary decision problems varying in five levels of difficulty. The success of our algorithm demonstrates the potential of using meta-predictions to leverage latent expertise in environments where forecasters' expertise cannot otherwise be easily identified."
https://openalex.org/W3017552407,"Tail rot disease is associated with major economic losses in the seahorse aquaculture in China. This study aimed to isolate and identify the pathogen causing tail rot disease in seahorses. Three culturable intestinal bacteria strains were isolated from Hippocampus kuda specimens with tail rot disease. Strain HL11, HL12, and HL13 were identified as Pseudoalteromonas spongiae, Bacillus subtilis and Photobacterium ganghwense based on its morphological characteristics, physiological and biochemical properties, through 16S rRNA and gyrB sequencing, respectively. Challenge experiments using these strains on healthy H. kuda and bacterial re-isolation from challenged diseased seahorses showed that the bacteria strain named HL11 induced identical pathological symptoms, indicating that it is the causative pathogen of the disease. Antibiotic-resistance tests against of 32 antibiotics revealed that HL11 was highly sensitive to 13 kinds, while exhibited intermediate susceptibility to 6, and resistance to 13 kinds. Antibacterial tests of the bioactive agents showed that HL11 was susceptible to five kinds, including tea polyphenols, lactic acid, gallic acid, allicin, and polylysine; however, it was not susceptible to the other 13 kinds of bioactive agents. The results demonstrate the potential of using bioactive agents to replace antibiotics to generate an environmentally friendly mode of culturing seahorses."
https://openalex.org/W3017900312,"Artificial reefs act as high-rugosity habitats and are often deployed to enhance fishing; however, the effects of man-made features on fish communities can be unpredictable and are poorly understood in deeper waters. In this study, we used a submersible to describe a deep-water artificial reef complex (93–245 m) off of Ewa Beach, Oahu, Hawaii, USA, and evaluated possible conservation and/or fisheries-related contributions. Sixty-eight species were recorded, with larger features supporting greater diversity of species. Species composition changed strongly with depth and a faunal break was detected from 113–137 m. While the features supported diverse fish communities, they were not similar to those on natural substrates, and were numerically dominated by only two species, Lutjanis kasmira and Chromis verater. Depth-generalist and endemic species were present at levels comparable to natural substrates, but were less abundant and species-rich than at biogenic Leptoseris reefs at similar depths. While the non-native L. kasmira was highly abundant, its presence and abundance were not associated with discernable changes in the fish community, and was not present deeper than 120 m. Finally, five species of commercially- and recreationally-important ‘Deep 7’ fisheries species were also observed, but the artificial reef complex was mostly too shallow to provide meaningful benefits."
https://openalex.org/W3017416829,"Background Recently, the importance of chronic total occlusion (CTO)-percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) has been emphasized with greater success rates. In the antegrade wire based approach, it is generally considered that the guidewire would not advance from the subintimal space to the intimal space without dissection re-entry device. However, it is sometimes observed by intravascular ultrasound (IVUS) that the guidewire within the subintimal space advanced into the distal true lumen. The purpose of this study was to investigate specific conditions or characteristics which were associated with “antegrade true-sub-true” phenomenon in CTO-PCI. Methods We retrospectively reviewed consecutive 320 CTO lesions that underwent CTO-PCI in our institution. Among them, 16 lesions in which the IVUS confirmed the “antegrade true-sub-true” phenomenon were categorized as the true-sub-true group, whereas 27 lesions that resulted in unsuccessful CTO-PCI were categorized as the unsuccessful group. We compared the clinical, lesion, and procedural characteristics between the true-sub-true group and the unsuccessful group. Results The prevalence of bifurcation with abrupt type in CTO exit-sites was significantly higher in the true-sub-true group in comparison to the unsuccessful group (75.0% vs. 25.9%, p = 0.002). The multivariate logistic regression analysis revealed that bifurcation with abrupt type in CTO exit-site (OR 8.017; 95%CI: 1.484–43.304; p = 0.016) was independent predictor of the antegrade true-sub-true phenomenon. Conclusions In CTO-PCI, the antegrade true-sub-true phenomenon is rare, but can be a last chance for successful PCI. Bifurcation with abrupt type in CTO exit-site was significantly associated with the antegrade true-sub-true phenomenon."
https://openalex.org/W3020480851,"The introduction of bundled payment for maternity care, aimed at improving the quality of maternity care, may affect pregnant women's choice in providers of maternity care. This paper describes a Dutch study which examined pregnant women's preferences when choosing a maternity care provider. The study focused on factors that enhance the quality of maternity care versus (restricted) provider choice.A discrete choice experiment was conducted amongst 611 pregnant women living in the Netherlands using an online questionnaire. The data were analysed with Latent Class Analyses. The outcome measure consisted of stated preferences in the discrete choice experiment. Included factors were: information exchange by care providers through electronic medical records, information provided by midwife, information provided by friends, freedom to choose maternity care provider and travel distance.Four different preference structures were found. In two of those structures, respondents found aspects of the maternity care related to quality of care more important than being able to choose a provider (provider choice). In the two other preference structures, respondents found provider choice more important than aspects related to quality of maternity care.In a country with presumed high-quality maternity care like the Netherlands, about half of pregnant women prefer being able to choose their maternity care provider over organisational factors that might imply better quality of care. A comparable amount of women find quality-related aspects most important when choosing a maternity care provider and are willing to accept limitations in their choice of provider. These insights are relevant for policy makers in order to be able to design a bundled payment model which justify the preferences of all pregnant women."
