https://openalex.org/W1585634514,"We have purified a human non-pancreatic phospholipase A2 that is present in platelets and is enriched in rheumatoid synovial fluid. The enzyme is calcium-dependent, has a pH optimum of 8-10, and shows a striking preference for substrate presented in the form of Escherichia coli membranes. In the E. coli phospholipase A2 assay the phospholipase exhibits an apparent specific activity of 300 mumol/mg/min. Using oligonucleotide probes based on amino-terminal sequence data, we cloned the corresponding human gene from a genomic DNA library and expressed the gene in animal cells. The protein was secreted from the cells in an active form. The deduced amino acid sequence of the human protein consists of 124 amino acids, contains structural features common to all known phospholipase A2s, and has a half-cystine pattern that is characteristic of the snake venom group II enzymes."
https://openalex.org/W1536233348,"Abstract Changes in cytosolic free magnesium ion concentration (Mgi) during myocardial ischemia were measured by 19F NMR in perfused rat hearts loaded with fluorine-labeled derivatives of the magnesium chelator o-aminophenol-N,N,O-triacetate. The perfused rat hearts were loaded intracellularly with the appropriate magnesium indicator by perfusion with 200-400 ml of Krebs-Henseleit buffer containing 5 microM acetoxymethyl ester of the indicator. Basal Mgi concentrations measured by three different indicators averaged 0.85 +/- 0.10 mM (n = 9) and showed no correlation with the KD of the indicator used. 31P NMR measurements of the magnesium-dependent shift between alpha- and beta-phosphates of ATP demonstrate that there is no measurable lowering of Mgi during loading with fluorinated o-aminophenol-N,N,O-triacetate. Between 10 and 15 min of ischemia, Mgi rose nearly 3-fold to 2.1 +/- 0.4 mM. This increase in Mgi occurred over the same time course as the decrease in ATP. After 20 min of reperfusion with Krebs-Henseleit buffer, Mgi declined to 1.5 +/- 0.5 mM. This sustained elevation of Mgi above basal levels may inhibit calcium release from sarcoplasmic reticulum, thereby contributing to the well documented impairment of mechanical function that occurs after a reversible period of ischemia."
https://openalex.org/W1583504083,"When screening various isoquinolinesulfonamide compounds which we synthesized, CKI-7, N-(2-amino-ethyl)-5-chloroisoquinoline-8-sulfonamide, was found to have a potent inhibitory action against casein kinase I and a much weaker effect on casein kinase II and other protein kinases. Kinetic analysis indicated that CKI-7 inhibited casein kinase I competitively with respect to ATP and that the Ki values were 8.5 microM for casein kinase I and 70 microM for casein kinase II. An affinity chromatography absorbent was synthesized by coupling CKI-8 (1-(5-chloroisoquinoline-8-sulfonyl], a derivative of CKI-7, to cyanogen bromide-activated Sepharose 4B. Partially purified casein kinase I from bovine testis was subjected to affinity chromatography. Analysis of the purified casein kinase I by polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis in the presence of sodium dodecyl sulfate revealed a single band with molecular weight 37,000. These newly synthesized compounds, CKI-7 and CKI-8, should serve as useful tools for elucidating the biological significance of casein kinase I-mediated reactions."
https://openalex.org/W1606451505,"We used infrared attenuated total reflection spectroscopy to study the structure of diphtheria toxin (DT) and its fragments A, B, CB1, and CB4 as a function of the pH in the absence and in the presence of phospholipid vesicles. Binding of DT to asolectin or DL-alpha-dipalmitoylphosphatidylcholine-DL-alpha-dipalmitoylphosphatidic acid liposomes at pH 7.3 results in a 10% increase in its alpha-helix content. At pH 4, in the presence of liposomes, the secondary structure of DT is characterized by the appearance of a beta-sheet structure with strengthened hydrogen bonds which did not exist before pH lowering. DT fragment B displays little conformational change upon pH lowering in the presence of liposomes. However, the alpha-helix content of CB1 increases by 10%, and polarization measurements indicate that the alpha-helices of CB1 at pH 4 are oriented parallel to the lipid acyl chains. On the other hand, the alpha-helix content of CB4 decreases dramatically while the low frequency beta-sheet content increases. Dichroism measurements demonstrate that this sheet lies close to a parallel to the bilayer surface. The fragment A of DT experiences a large conformational change upon pH lowering and binds to the liposome membrane even in the absence of DT fragment B. The conformational modification of DT fragment A is fully reversed when pH is brought back to 7.3."
https://openalex.org/W1505925742,"A number of cellular processes involving vesicle transport are inhibited during mitosis. In the present study we asked whether the transport of a newly synthesized glycerophospholipid and (some) sphingolipids from their site(s) of intracellular synthesis to the plasma membranes of Chinese hamster ovary cells was also inhibited at mitosis. (i) For phospholipids, we examined the movement of phosphatidylethanolamine (PE) following its de novo synthesis from [3H]ethanolamine (Sleight, R. G., and Pagano, R. E. (1983) J. Biol. Chem. 258, 9050-9058). Plasma membrane PE was distinguished from intracellular PE by its derivatization with the amino-reactive reagent, trinitrobenzenesulfonic acid, under nonpermeating conditions. Both the steady state amount of PE and the rate of appearance of newly synthesized PE at the cell surface were quantified. Transport of newly synthesized PE to the plasma membrane was not inhibited at mitosis but was found to be a rapid process similar to that previously reported for interphase cells. (ii) For sphingolipids, we examined the transport of fluorescent analogs of sphingomyelin and glucosylceramide (GlcCer) to the plasma membrane following their de novo synthesis from the fluorescent sphingolipid precursor, N-[7-(4-nitrobenzo-2-oxa-1,3-diazole)]aminocaproyl D-erythro-sphingosine (Lipsky, N. G., and Pagano, R. E. (1985a) J. Cell Biol. 100, 27-34). Transport of fluorescent sphingomyelin and glucosylceramide to the plasma membrane was inhibited in mitotic cells but not in interphase or G1 cells. These results are discussed in terms of alternative mechanisms for delivery of the newly synthesized lipids to the outer leaflet of the plasma membrane bilayer."
https://openalex.org/W1583417191,"Radiolabeled preprocecropin B, with an alpha-amidated COOH terminus, and preprocecropin A, extended at the COOH terminus by a glycine residue, were synthesized by solid-phase methods. The respective syntheses were interrupted at intervals to allow the preparation of the predicted procecropins A and B as well as three other truncated derivatives of the cecropin A precursors. All the synthetic peptides were purified to near homogeneity by reverse-phase liquid chromatography and their purity was established by analytical high performance liquid chromatography, gel electrophoresis, and amino acid analysis. A dipeptidyl aminopeptidase was purified about 350 times from the hemolymph of cecropia pupae and characterized by its affinity for different substrates and inhibitors. The synthetic prepro peptides were tested for processing by an extract of dog pancreas microsomes and purified leader peptidase from Escherichia coli, with and without partly purified dipeptidyl aminopeptidase, and the two synthetic proforms were also processed with the dipeptidyl aminopeptidase alone. From these experiments we conclude that the signal/leader peptidase cleaves the peptide bond between Ala-5 and Ala-4. This cleavage site is further substantiated by radio sequencing of procecropin A isolated after synthesis in a coupled system for in vitro transcription, translation, and processing. The two procecropins, which are stable to further digestion by the signal peptidase, are further processed by dipeptidyl aminopeptidase which removes, in two steps, the dipeptides Ala-Pro (residues -4 and -3) and Glu-Pro (residues -2 and -1). Although the synthetic peptide with only one dipeptide (Glu-Pro) preceding the mature cecropin sequence could function as a substrate for dipeptidyl aminopeptidase, it could be demonstrated as an intermediate in the enzymatic reaction with the procecropins. Dipeptidyl aminopoptidase did not cleave the procecropin analog when it was preceded by a single alanine residue, i.e. preprocecropin (-5,38). Antibacterial activity was demonstrated for the mature cecropin A-Gly obtained by processing of the synthetic preproprotein."
https://openalex.org/W1581891708,"To assess the role of protein kinase C (Ca2+/phospholipid-dependent enzyme) in the activation of the human neutrophil respiratory burst, we have utilized an ether lipid of the type 1-O-alkyl-2-O-methylglycerol (AMG), recently shown to be an inhibitor of this kinase. AMG-C16 (with an hexadecyl chain at the sn-1 position) was found to inhibit the respiratory burst induced by sub-optimal concentrations of phorbol 12,13-dibutyrate. Respiratory burst activity was recovered by subsequent addition of a supraoptimal dose of phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate, indicating that in the presence of the inhibitor only the activation of the NADPH:O2 oxidoreductase via protein kinase C is inhibited, but not the oxidoreductase itself. The respiratory burst induced by the chemoattractant N-formyl-methionyl-leucyl-phenylalanine (fMLP) was also inhibited in the presence of AMG-C16, the extent of inhibition being dependent on the concentration of fMLP. At the concentrations applied in these studies, AMG-C16 had no effect on cell viability, did not affect the formation of inositol phosphates induced by fMLP, and did not affect the characteristics of the Ca2+ fluxes induced by the same stimulus. In a cell-free assay system, AMG-C16 had no effect on the activity of cAMP-dependent or Ca2+/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase but inhibited protein kinase C in a dose-dependent fashion. To characterize the inhibitory action of AMG-C16 on the respiratory burst activity in more detail, we studied protein phosphorylation in relation to respiratory burst activity in neutrophil cytoplasts. We focused on the phosphorylation of the 47-kDa protein, because this protein is functionally associated with the NADPH:O2 oxidoreductase. At suboptimal concentrations of phorbol 12,13-dibutyrate, AMG-C16 inhibited phosphorylation of proteins, including that of the 47-kDa protein. Recovery of protein phosphorylation in parallel to recovery of respiratory burst activity was obtained by addition of increasing doses of phorbol 12,13-dibutyrate. Recovery of respiratory burst activity at intermediate concentrations of fMLP did not result in a proportional increase in 47-kDa protein phosphorylation; phosphorylation of the 47-kDa protein was recovered only at high concentrations of fMLP. From these data we conclude that protein kinase C is involved in the activation of the respiratory burst by phorbol esters and fMLP. However, with fMLP as a stimulus, a second signal seems to be triggered, which is insensitive to AMG-C16."
https://openalex.org/W1603059344,"Abstract The sea urchin hatching enzyme provides an interesting model for the control of gene expression during early development. In order to study its properties and developmental regulation, the hatching enzyme of the species Paracentrotus lividus has been purified. The fertilization envelopes of the embryos were digested before hatching by a crude culture supernatant previously made. The enzyme was then solubilized by 1 M NaCl and 0.5% 3-[(3-cholamidopropyl)dimethylammonio]-1-propanesulfonate and purified by hydrophobic chromatography on Procion-agarose. A 470-fold increase in specific activity was obtained. The kinetic parameters of the proteolytic activity using dimethylcasein as substrate are: Km = 120 micrograms x ml-1, Vm = 200 mumol x min-1 x mg-1, and kcat = 180 s-1 at 500 mM NaCl, 10 mM CaCl2, pH 8.0, at 35 degrees C. The purified enzyme is highly active on fertilization envelopes: at 20 degrees C and 500 mM NaCl, 10 mM CaCl2, pH 8.0, 100 ng of enzyme completely denudes embryos in about 20 min under standard conditions. The molecular mass of the enzyme was estimated as 57 kDa by gel filtration, 51 kDa by gel electrophoresis, and 52 kDa by amino acid analysis. The hatching enzyme was shown to be a glycoprotein which autolyzes to a 30-kDa inactive form. Antibodies raised against the 51- or 30-kDa forms reacted with both these forms. Immunoblotting experiments showed that the hatching supernatants contain important amounts of the autolyzed species."
https://openalex.org/W1588546604,"The nuclease activity of 1,10-phenanthroline copper ion was targeted to a specific sequence by attachment of the ligand to the 5' or 3' end of octathymidylates. An acridine derivative was also attached to the other end of the oligothymidylate-phenanthroline conjugate. The duplex formed by the oligothymidylate with its complementary sequence was stabilized by intercalation of the acridine derivative. The reaction induced by 3-mercaptopropionic acid led to a very localized cleavage of a 27-nucleotide-long DNA fragment containing a (dA)8 sequence. At high NaCl concentration or in the presence of spermine, cleavage of the single-stranded 27-mer fragment occurred on both sides of the target sequence. This was ascribed to the formation of a triple helix involving two 1,10-phenanthroline-octathymidylate strands that adopt an antiparallel orientation with respect to each other. When a 27-mer duplex was used as a substrate, cleavage sites were observed on both strands. The location of the cleavage sites led us to conclude that the octathymidylate was bound to the (dA)8.(dT)8 sequence in a parallel orientation with respect to the (dA)8-containing strand. This result reflects the ability of thymine to form two hydrogen bonds with an adenine already engaged in a Watson-Crick base pair. This study shows that it is possible to design DNA-binding oligodeoxynucleotides that could selectively recognize and cleave polypurine-polypyrimidine sequences in double-stranded DNA."
https://openalex.org/W1900319011,"The heterobifunctional, photoactivatable, thiol-cleavable cross-linker sulfosuccinimidyl 2-(p-azido-salicylamido)ethyl-1,3′-dithiopropionate (SASD) was radioiodinated and used to determine whether endothelial albumin binding proteins (ABP) recently identified (Ghinea, N., Fixman, A., Alexandru, D., Popov, D., Hasu, M., Ghitescu, L., Eskenasy, M., Simionescu, M., and Simionescu, N. (1988) J. Cell Biol. 107, 231–239) are plasma membrane-associated components exposed on the cell surface. Microvascular endothelial cells (MEC) freshly isolated from rat epididymal fat were incubated with 125I-2-(p-azidosalicylamido)ethyl-1,3′-dithiopropionate (ASD)-albumin conjugate which upon photolysis by UV light was cross-linked to the receptor proteins. By cleaving the disulfide linkages of the cross-linker with 5% β-mercaptoethanol and the ligand-receptor interactions with 0.1% sodium dodecyl sulfate, the radioiodinated ASD moiety remained attached to the receptor peptides which were further detected by 5% sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis followed by autoradiography. In parallel, samples were examined by ligand blotting with albumin-gold complex. The results showed that in these experimental conditions ABP are represented by two major peptides of 31 and 18 kDa and two minor bands of 73 and 56 kDa. Densitometric scanning showed that the two major bands constitute more than 70% of the total ABP. The four peptides were not apparent if the samples were not UV-irradiated. The binding of the radioiodinated ligand to ABPs was reduced by ∼ 82% in the presence of excess competitive unlabeled albumin. When MEC were incubated with unlabeled SASD and exposed to UV light, the autoradiographic banding pattern obtained was similar to that of either radioiodinated receptor proteins or MEC not treated with SASD. This indicated that the four albumin binding peptides are distinct proteins of the endothelial cell plasmalemma."
https://openalex.org/W1505453996,"Abstract The denitrifier Pseudomonas perfectomarina reduced nitrite under conditions of kinetic competition between cells and gas sparging for extracellular dissolved nitric and nitrous oxides, NOaq and N2Oaq, in a chemically defined marine medium. Time courses of nitrite reduction and NOg and N2Og alpha removal were integrated to give NOg and N2Og yields. At high sparging rates, the NOg yield was greater than 50% of nitrite-N reduced, and the yield of NOg + N2Og was approximately 75%. Hence interrupted denitrification yields NOaq and N2Oaq as major products. The yields varied with sparging rates in agreement with a quantitative model of denitrification (Betlach, M. P., and Tiedje, J.M. (1981) Appl. Environ. Microbiol. 42, 1074-1084) that applies simplified Michaelis-Menten kinetics to NO2-----NOaq----N2Oaq----N2. The fit gave an estimate of the maximum scavengeable NOaq yield of 73 +/- 8% of nitrite-N. Thus a minor path independent of NOaq is also required. The fit of the model to data at lower sparging rates, where normal denitrification products predominate, implies that the extracellular NOaq pool yield is independent of gas sparging rate. Thus in P. perfectomarina NOaq and N2Oaq are intermediates, or facilely equilibrate with true intermediates, during complete denitrification. The recovery of most nitrite-N as NO and/or N2O under perturbed conditions is not an artifact of irreversible product removal, but an attribute of denitrification in this species, and most probably it is characteristic of denitrification in other species as well."
https://openalex.org/W1546022381,"Tumor necrosis factor (TNF) can inhibit the differentiation of preadipocytes to adipocytes and will revert differentiated adipocytes to the preadipocyte state. TNF is not toxic to either adipocytes or preadipocytes when used alone but is highly toxic to these cells when used in conjunction with cycloheximide, yielding virtually 100% killing within 4-6 h of treatment. A cell line (TA1 R-6) was isolated which is resistant to the combined toxic effects of TNF and cycloheximide. This cell line is stable and, unlike the parental cell line, does not morphologically differentiate to adipocytes or express adipocyte-specific mRNAs. It has a more transformed appearance and growth pattern and, while resistant to the toxic effects of TNF and cycloheximide in a 6-h assay, has become sensitive to cytotoxicity induced by TNF used alone in a 3-day assay. The adipocyte differentiation-inducing agents, dexamethasone and indomethacin, block the cytotoxicity induced by TNF alone in the TA1 R-6 line but do not block the rapid cytotoxicity of TNF and cycloheximide in the parental line. These results provide both genetic and pharmacologic evidence that there are at least two distinct or overlapping pathways by which TNF mediates its effects."
https://openalex.org/W1592791766,"Human T cells (H9), infected with the HTLV-IIIB strain of the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV-1), have been used to study the alteration of 2',5'-oligoadenylate [2'-5')A) metabolism in relation to virus production. The synthesis of (2'-5')A was determined to proceed in close association with the nuclear matrix. After HIV infection the (2'-5')A synthetase activity increased from 1.1 to 1.5 pmol of (2'-5')A synthesized/100 micrograms of nuclear matrix protein (during a 3-h in vitro incubation period) to 8.2 pmol at day 3 after infection. Then the activity dropped to the initial values. In non-infected H9 cells the (2'-5')A synthetase activity remained unchanged. Simultaneously with the decrease of the (2'-5')A level the cells started to release HIV. At the time of maximum synthetase levels the (2'-5')A-activated endoribonuclease (RNase L) activity strongly increased. Only one protein could be selectively cross-linked to a (2'-5')A derivative in the nuclear matrix from H9 cells; this protein is assumed to be RNase L. Experimental evidence is provided revealing that RNase L degrades HIV transcripts. A correlation could be established between high levels of (2'-5')A and RNase L and a failure of the cells to release HIV. 3'-Azido-3'-deoxythymidine was shown to cause an extension of the time period during which an RNase L-mediated degradation of viral transcripts occurred. The possibility of a novel molecular pharmacologic approach on the level of (2'-5')A metabolism is discussed."
https://openalex.org/W1493670265,"Measurements of cell volume changes, free cytosolic Ca2+ concentration [( Ca2+]i) with Fura 2 and cell membrane potential with 3,3'-dipropylthiodicarbocyanine iodide were used to study the effect of cell volume change on Ca2+ influx and the membrane potential of the osteoblastic osteosarcoma cell line, UMR-106-01. Swelling the cells by hypo-osmotic stress was followed by reduction in cell volume which was markedly impaired by removal of medium Ca2+. Accordingly, cell swelling resulted in [Ca2+]i increase only in the presence of medium Ca2+. The cell swelling-activated Ca2+ entry pathway was active at resting membrane potentials, and Ca2+ influx through this pathway markedly increased upon cell hyperpolarization. A linear relationship between Ca2+ entry and the potential across the plasma membrane was observed. Thus, the volume-activated Ca2+ permeating pathway in UMR-106-01 cells has conductive properties. These pathways do not spontaneously inactivate with time when the cells are not allowed to volume regulate. The pathway can be blocked by micromolar concentrations of nicardipine and La3+ but display very low sensitivity to diltiazem and verapamil. Activation of the volume-sensitive, Ca2+ permeating pathway was not dependent on an increase in [Ca2+]i. Likewise, activation of the pathway was independent of a change in membrane potential between -85 and -3 mV. The increase in [Ca2+]i resulted in hyperpolarization of the cells, probably due to activation of Ca2+-activated K+ channels. The volume-sensitive pathways were partially active under isotonic conditions. Their activity was inhibited by cell shrinkage and increased by cell swelling. The pathways were sensitive to small changes in cell volume, particularly around a medium osmolarity of 310 mosM."
https://openalex.org/W1548423451,"We have studied the membrane topology of liver microsomal cytochromes P-450 derived from phenobarbital-treated rabbits via trypsinolysis of intact microsomes, recovery of solubilized peptide fragments by ultracentrifugation and liquid chromatography, primary structure determination by Edman microsequence analysis, and database searching to match isolated fragments with parent sequences. Relative to the primary structure of isozyme 2, the major phenobarbital-inducible form, fragments were isolated beginning at residues Glu86, Ile101, Arg126, Cys152, Leu198, Ser211, Asn237, Glu327, Asn385, Thr407, Phe408, Phe413, and Thr444. Such results show that this family of structurally related cytochromes is bound to the endoplasmic reticulum membrane by only one or two transmembrane segments, located at the NH2-terminal end of the polypeptide chain. The remainder of the protein, from residue approximately 50 to the COOH terminus must exist as a catalytic, heme-containing domain exposed on the cytosolic side of the membrane. Furthermore, our results indicate that the catalytic domain must be peripherally associated with the membrane surface. This would imply that substrates might have access to the active site of the cytochrome P-450 either by diffusion from the cytosol or from within the lipid bilayer."
https://openalex.org/W1558413876,"Abstract A novel sulfated glycosphingolipid containing a sulfated glucosyl residue was isolated from rat kidney and purified to homogeneity by column chromatographies with DEAE-Sephadex and silica beads. By compositional analyses, permethylation studies, one- and two-dimensional proton magnetic resonance spectroscopy, infrared spectroscopy, negative secondary ion mass spectrometry, solvolysis, and immunostaining on thin layer chromatogram, the structure of this glycolipid was proposed to be HSO3-3Glc beta 1-1Cer (where Cer is ceramide). The ceramide portion consisted of 4-D-hydroxysphinganine as the sole long chain base, and the fatty acid consisted of predominantly tetracosanoic acid, deduced from both composition analysis and negative secondary ion mass spectrometry. The yield of glucosyl sulfatide was about 5 nmol/g of tissue, being about three times as much as that of lactosylceramide sulfate."
https://openalex.org/W1573975307,"Abstract The mRNA coding for the rat liver S14 protein (Mr 17,000; pI 4.9) is rapidly induced by triiodothyronine (T3) (Jump, D. B., Narayan, P., Towle, H. C., and Oppenheimer, J. H. (1984) J. Biol. Chem. 259, 2789-2797). In an effort to define the molecular basis for the rapid increase in mRNAS14, the in vitro run-on activity and chromatin structure of the S14 gene was examined. Following injection of hypothyroid rats with a receptor-saturating dose of T3, a 5-min lag period preceded a rapid increase in S14 gene transcription. S14 transcriptional activity was induced 3.8-fold within 15 min and reached nearly 70% of the maximal 9-fold induction within 60 min of T3 administration. Hepatic mRNAS14 levels were induced 2.4-, 19-, and 24-fold within 15 min, 4 h, and 24 h, respectively. Thus, the rapid T3-mediated induction of mRNAS14 was due, in large part, to a rapid and apparent direct effect of T3 on S14 transcriptional activity. Analysis of S14 chromatin structure showed that the Hss-3 DNase I hypersensitive site located 3.3 kilobases (kb) upstream from the hepatic S14 cap site was present in both euthyroid and hyperthyroid states, but either absent or present at diminished DNase I sensitivity in the hypothyroid state. However, within 5 min of T3 administration to hypothyroid rats, the Hss-3 DNase I hypersensitive site was significantly induced. The induction of this structure preceded T3 induction of S14 gene transcription. Other DNase I hypersensitive sites located adjacent to the S14 cap site at -65 to -265 base pairs (Hss-1) or upstream at -1.3 kb (Hss-2), -2.1 kb (Hss-3'), -5.3 kb (Hss-4), and -6.2 kb (Hss-5) remained unaffected by changes in S14 gene transcription. The rapid T3 effect on the Hss-3 DNase I hypersensitive site may reflect the presence of T3 receptors in the vicinity of this chromatin locus. Modification of chromatin structure in the vicinity of the Hss-3 site may be an important antecedent event for T3-mediated induction of S14 gene transcription."
https://openalex.org/W1586989338,"Abstract During the process of transduction of a photon signal in vertebrate rod outer segments, transducin, a guanine nucleotide binding protein, mediates between a photobleaching intermediate of rhodopsin and a cGMP-phosphodiesterase. We report here that the beta gamma-subunit of bovine transducin (T beta gamma) characterized so far consists of two components (T beta gamma-1 and T beta gamma-2), which can be separated by anion exchange chromatography under nondenaturing conditions. Both components consisted of two polypeptides of Mr 36,000 (T beta) and about 8,000 (T gamma) in sodium dodecyl sulfate polyacrylamide (13%) gel electrophoresis. On a further analysis by 8 M urea/sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, T gamma subunits of T beta gamma-1 and T beta gamma-2 showed Mr values of 8,000 (T gamma-1) and 6,000 (T gamma-2), respectively. Amino acid compositions of both T gamma-1 and T gamma-2 roughly corresponded with that of T gamma previously reported and were quite different from that of gamma-subunit of cGMP-phosphodiesterase. Western blot analysis of freshly isolated rod outer segments by an antiserum raised against a mixture of T beta gamma-1 and T beta gamma-2 revealed the presence of both components in the membranes of a starting material. This observation excludes the possibility that one of the components might be produced artificially in the course of the purification. In the presence of a photobleaching intermediate of either unphosphorylated or phosphorylated rhodopsin, the binding of guanosine 5'-(beta, gamma-imido)triphosphate (GppNHp) to the alpha-subunit of transducin (T alpha) was remarkably enhanced with increasing concentrations of purified T beta gamma-2. On the contrary, T beta gamma-1 retained little ability, if any, to enhance the GppNHp binding to T alpha; the ability of T beta gamma-1 was at least 30 times lower than that of T beta gamma-2. Such a low activity of T beta gamma-1 was attributed to inability for coupling of T alpha with a photobleaching intermediate of rhodopsin. These results indicate that T gamma-2 is essential for the GTP binding of transducin. The role of T gamma-1 in vertebrate photoreceptor cells was discussed."
https://openalex.org/W1516253953,"The high levels of peptidylglycine alpha-amidating monooxygenase (PAM, EC 1.14.17.3) found in adult rat atrium led us to examine PAM expression in rat atrium and ventricle from embryonic day 14 through adulthood. Immunocytochemical studies using antisera to PAM identified cardiocytes as the major site of PAM expression in atrium and ventricle throughout development. Levels of PAM mRNA and PAM activity exhibited distinctly different developmental profiles in atrium and ventricle. Ventricular PAM mRNA and PAM activity were highest from embryonic days 14 through 18, declined at the time of birth, rose slightly during the first postnatal week, and declined toward adult levels. Atrial PAM mRNA and PAM activity were low at embryonic day 14, rose to a peak immediately before birth, declined at the time of birth, and then rose after birth. Levels of atrial PAM mRNA and PAM activity were not directly correlated at all developmental stages. Two major forms of PAM mRNA (4.2 +/- 0.1 and 3.8 +/- 0.1 kilobase(s] were identified in atrium and ventricle throughout development. The prevalence of the two forms varied with developmental stage, with atrium and ventricle containing similar forms at each stage. Western blots of atrial and ventricular membranes revealed the existence of a developmental stage-specific distribution of PAM protein among forms ranging in mass from 125 to 94 kDa. In both atrium and ventricle PAM activity was primarily soluble from embryonic days 14 through 16 and primarily particulate after birth. The role of PAM in the heart is not yet clear, but the presence of tissue-specific and developmentally regulated alterations in PAM mRNA, PAM protein, and PAM activity suggests that this peptide processing enzyme plays a key role in the heart."
https://openalex.org/W1509440618,"Lysosomes contain enzymatic activities capable of degrading nucleic acids to their constituent nucleosides, but the manner by which these degradation products are released from the lysosome is unknown. To investigate this process, human fibroblast lysosomes, purified on Percoll density gradients, were incubated with [3H]adenosine at pH 7.0, and the amount of adenosine taken up by the lysosomes was measured. Adenosine uptake by fibroblast lysosomes attained a steady state by 12 min at 37 degrees C and was unaffected by the presence of 2 mM MgATP or changes in pH from 5.0 to 8.0. An Arrhenius plot was linear with an activation energy of 12.9 kcal/mol and a Q10 of 2.0. Lysosomal adenosine uptake is saturable, displaying a Km of 9 mM at pH 7.0 and 37 degrees C. Various nucleosides and the nucleobase, 6-dimethylaminopurine, strongly inhibit lysosomal adenosine uptake, whereas neither D-ribose or nucleotide monophosphates have any significant effect upon lysosomal adenosine uptake. On a molar basis, purines are recognized more strongly than pyrimidines. Changing the nature of the nucleoside sugar from ribose to arabinose or deoxyribose has little effect on reactivity with this transport system. The known plasma membrane nucleoside transport inhibitors, dipyridamole and nitrobenzylthioinosine, inhibit lysosomal nucleoside transport at relatively low concentrations (25 microM) relative to the Km of 9 mM for lysosomal adenosine uptake. The half-times of [3H]inosine and [3H]uridine efflux from fibroblast lysosomes ranged from 6 to 8 min at 37 degrees C. Trans effects were not observed to be associated with either inosine or uridine exodus. In contrast to adenosine uptake, adenine primarily enters fibroblast lysosomes by a route not saturable by high concentrations of various nucleosides. In conclusion, the saturability of lysosomal adenosine uptake and its specific, competitive inhibition by other nucleosides indicate the existence of a carrier-mediated transport system for nucleosides within fibroblast lysosomal membranes."
https://openalex.org/W1532965526,"Abstract The partitioning of bilirubin between albumin and model and biological membranes and the differential partitioning of bilirubin between membranes with different lipid and protein compositions were measured. Partition coefficients were independent of the concentration of bilirubin in membranes up to at least 7 mol of bilirubin/mol of phospholipid. The avidity of albumin for bilirubin was greater than that of membranes, but the avidity of the latter for bilirubin depended on the composition of the membrane. Bilirubin partitioned preferentially into model membranes comprised of microsomal lipids greater than dioleoylphosphatidylcholine = plasma membrane lipids much greater than egg phosphatidylcholine = dimyristoylphosphatidylcholine. Partitioning into membranes was increased if these contained proteins, but the effect of proteins could not be attributed to specific binding to sites on proteins, as reflected by the temperature independence of partition coefficients. Differential partitioning of bilirubin into different membranes of pure lipids also was independent of temperature. Differences in the bulk phase fluidity of membranes does not appear to account for the preferential partitioning of bilirubin into some membranes. It appears that bilirubin partitions into elements of free volume of differing sizes in membranes with variable lipid compositions and that the size of these elements can be increased by adding proteins to membranes."
https://openalex.org/W1558325670,"Abstract Phloroglucinol reductase was purified 90-fold to homogeneity from the anaerobic rumen organism Eubacterium oxidoreducens strain G-41. The enzyme is stable in the presence of air and is found in the soluble fraction after ultracentrifugation of cell extract. Ion-exchange, hydrophobic interaction, and affinity chromatography were used to purify the enzyme. The native Mr is 78,000, and the subunit Mr is 33,000 indicating an alpha 2 homodimer. The enzyme is specific for phloroglucinol and NADPH. The Km and Vmax are 600 microM and 640 mumol min-1 mg-1 (pH 7.2) for phloroglucinol, and 6.7 microM and 550 mumol min-1 mg-1 (pH 6.8) for NADPH; the Km and Vmax for the reverse direction are 290 microM and 140 mumol min-1 mg-1 (pH 7.2) for dihydrophloroglucinol, and 27 microM and 220 mumol min-1 mg-1 (pH 7.2) for NADP. Temperature and pH optima are 40 degrees C and 7.8 in the forward direction. The pure enzyme is colorless in solution and flavins are absent. Analysis for cobalt, manganese, molybdenum, vanadium, tungsten, selenium, copper, nickel, iron, and zinc indicated that these metals are not components of the phloroglucinol reductase. Cupric chloride, n-ethylmaleimide, and p-chloromercuribenzoate are potent inhibitors of enzyme activity. The properties of phloroglucinol reductase indicate that it functions in the pathway of anaerobic degradation of trihydroxybenzenes by catalyzing reduction of the aromatic nucleus prior to ring fission."
https://openalex.org/W1588556361,"Indenestrol A (IA) and indenestrol B (IB) are analogs and metabolites of diethylstilbestrol (DES). These compounds have high binding affinity with the estrogen receptor (ER) but possess weak uterotropic activity. Due to their chemical structures, IA and IB exist as mixtures of enantiomers. We investigated whether the poor biological activity of these compounds was due to differential activity of the enantiomers. We also utilized these compounds as probes to determine the extent of stereochemical sensitivity in the ER ligand binding site. The IA and IB enantiomers were separated to greater than 98% purity using a chiral high pressure liquid chromatography column. Their enantiomeric nature was confirmed by mass spectrometry and NMR. The purified IA enantiomer peak 1 was derivatized with 4-bromobenzoyl chloride. The resulting di(4-bronobenzoate) IA was analyzed by x-ray crystallography and the absolute enantiomeric conformation assigned is C(3)-R. The IA enantiomers designated IA-R and A-S were assayed by competitive binding to cytosolic ER. The competitive binding index was estradiol, 100; DES, 286; IA-Rac (racemic mixture of IA), 143; IA-R, 3; and IA-S, 285; the index showed that ER demonstrates a stereochemical chiral preference. The IB enantiomers did not show a binding preference: IB, 145; IB-1, 100; and IB-2, 143. The differences in the IA enantiomer binding were shown to be due to competitive interactions by Lineweaver-Burk analysis of saturation binding of estradiol to ER in the presence of 1-, 5-, and 10-fold molar excess of competitor. Differences in binding affinity of the enantiomers could be partially explained by differences in the association rate constant (k+1) determined by association rate inhibition studies in which IA-S was 15 times more active than IA-R. Nuclear estrogen receptor levels were measured 1 h after in vivo treatment with doses of 5-20 micrograms/kg. The IA-Rac produced only 60% of the levels is compared with DES. Nuclear ER levels were checked every 30 min up to 2 h with no apparent difference, indicating that the low early levels were not due to a delayed estrogen receptor retention. When the enantiomers were tested individually only a dose of 10 micrograms/kg IA-S translocated ER to a level comparable to DES, while IA-R showed low levels at several doses. These results suggest that the poor biological activity of IA may be related to the differential ER interaction of its enantiomers.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)"

https://openalex.org/W1504684784,"The luteinizing hormone (LH)/human choriogonadotropin (hCG) receptor of rat ovary was solubilized with Lubrol PX in the presence of 20% glycerol and protease inhibitors, and purified by one-step affinity chromatography. Purified receptor had a specific hCG binding capacity of 4900 pmol/mg protein, and displayed a single class of high affinity binding sites (Ka = 6.20 X 10(9) M-1). An 11,200-fold purification over the starting crude homogenate was achieved. The purified LH/hCG receptor was identified by sodium dodecyl sulfate-gel electrophoresis and silver staining as a single protein of 92 kDa. The ability of the purified 92-kDa protein to specifically bind hormone was demonstrated by electroblotting onto Immobilon P membrane, incubation with 125I-labeled hCG, and autoradiography of the blot. In addition to a 92-kDa band, ligand blotting also yielded a 170-kDa band representing receptor dimer. Covalent cross-linking of hCG, with isotope in either the alpha- or beta-subunit, to membrane-bound receptor produced complexes that contained a single receptor component of approximately 92 kDa. The cross-linking studies indicated that both subunits interact with receptor and also suggested receptor dimer formation. Following sodium dodecyl sulfate-electrophoresis, purified receptor was electroblotted onto polyethylenimine-treated glass fiber filters for direct microsequencing in a gas-phase sequenator. Eleven cycles of sequence analysis yielded the unique sequence: NH2-Arg-Glu-Leu-Ser-Gly-Ser-Leu-XXX-Pro-Glu-Pro-COOH. These results indicate that the rat ovarian LH/hCG receptor is a protein of 92 kDa which can be easily purified in microgram amounts. This study also describes a relatively simple technique for electroblotting and microsequencing that should be applicable to other membrane-bound hormone receptors."

A full cDNA clone of the p49 subunit of mouse primase, a heterodimeric enzyme, has been isolated using a primase p49-specific polyclonal antibody to screen a λgt11 mouse cDNA expression library. The cDNA indicated the subunit is a 417-amino acid polypeptide with a calculated molecular mass of 49,295 daltons. The p49 mRNA is approximately 1500 nucleotides long with a 5′-untranslated region of 74 nucleotides and a 3′-untranslated region of 200 nucleotides. Comparison with a similar sized primase subunit from yeast showed highly conserved amino acid sequences in the N-terminal halves of the polypeptides and included a potential metal-binding domain suggesting the functional importance of this region for DNA binding. In contrast, the 3′ portion of the cDNA has rapidly diverged in nucleotide sequence, as primase mRNA can be detected in mouse and rat cells with a 3′ probe (including coding and noncoding) but not in RNA from hamster or human cells. A full-length cDNA probe detected mRNA from hamster and human cell lines, indicating a conserved 5′ portion and divergent 3′ region of the expressed gene. The rapid divergence may be related to the species-specific protein interactions found for the DNA polymerase α-primase complex. The mRNA is detected in proliferating but not in quiescent cells consistent with its function in DNA replication."
https://openalex.org/W1858340774,"We have previously reported that purified thyroid lysosomes bind to reconstituted microtubules to form stable complexes (Mithieux, G., Audebet, C., and Rousset, B. (1988) Biochim. Biophys. Acta 969, 121-130), a process which is inhibited by ATP (Mithieux, G., and Rousset, B. (1988) Biochim. Biophys. Acta 971, 29-37). Among detergent-solubilized lysosomal membrane protein, we identified a 50-kDa molecular component which binds to preassembled microtubules. The binding of this polypeptide to microtubules was decreased in the presence of ATP. We purified this 50-kDa protein by affinity chromatography on immobilized ATP. The 50-kDa protein bound to the ATP column was eluted by 1 mM ATP. The purified protein, labeled with 125I, exhibited the ability of interacting with microtubules. The binding process was inhibited by increasing concentrations of ATP, the half-maximal inhibitory effect being obtained at an ATP concentration of 0.35 mM. The interaction of the 50-kDa protein with microtubules is a saturable phenomenon since the binding of the 125I-labeled 50-kDa protein was inhibited by unlabeled solubilized lysosomal membrane protein containing the 50-kDa polypeptide but not by the same protein fraction from which the 50-kDa polypeptide had been removed by the ATP affinity chromatography procedure. The 50-kDa protein has the property to bind to pure tubulin coupled to an insoluble matrix. The 50-kDa protein was eluted from the tubulin affinity column by ATP. These findings support the conclusion that a protein inserted into the lysosomal membrane is able to bind directly to microtubules in a process which can be regulated by ATP. We propose that this protein could account for the association of lysosomes to microtubules demonstrated both in vitro and in intact cells."
https://openalex.org/W1574224188,"When sycamore cells were suspended in basal medium containing choline, the latter was taken up by the cells very rapidly. A facilitated diffusion system appertained at low concentrations of choline and exhibited Michaelis-Menten kinetics. At higher choline concentrations simple diffusion appeared to be the principal mode of uptake. Addition of choline to the perfusate of compressed sycamore cells monitored by 31P NMR spectroscopy resulted in a dramatic accumulation of P-choline in the cytoplasmic compartment containing choline kinase and not in the vacuole. The total accumulation of P-choline over a 10-h period exhibited Michaelis-Menten kinetics. During this period, in the absence of Pi in the perfusion medium there was a marked depletion of glucose-6-P, and the cytoplasmic Pi resonance disappeared almost completely. When a threshold of cytoplasmic Pi was attained, the phosphorylation of choline was sustained by the continuous release of Pi from the vacuole although at a much lower rate. However, when 100 microM inorganic phosphate was present in the perfusion medium, externally added Pi was preferentially used to sustain P-choline synthesis. It is clear, therefore, that cytosolic choline kinase associated with a carrier-mediated transport system for choline uptake appeared as effective systems for continuously trapping cytoplasmic Pi including vacuolar Pi entering the cytoplasm."
https://openalex.org/W1589661091,"Abstract Human umbilical vein endothelial cells express the B chain gene (c-sis) of platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF). PDGF acts as a mitogen for mesenchymal cells and has recently been reported to be a potent vasoconstrictor (Berk, B. C., Alexander, R. W., Brock, T. A., Gimbrone, M. A., Jr., and Webb, R. C. (1986) Science 232, 87-90). Regulation of c-sis therefore, may play an important role in maintaining and controlling the integrity of the vasculature. We report here that basic fibroblast growth factor (bFGF), a growth factor for endothelial cells in culture, significantly decreases the amount of PDGF-like protein secreted by these cells. Levels of c-sis mRNA increase more than 10-fold in the absence of bFGF. This effect is specific for the B chain of PDGF as transcript levels of other growth factors synthesized by endothelial cells, such as transforming growth factor beta are not affected by bFGF. c-sis mRNA levels increase 12 h after bFGF removal as the cells begin to accumulate in G0 stage of the cell cycle and remain elevated for at least 96 h. Transcript levels fall again upon re-exposure of the cells to bFGF. bFGF may regulate c-sis mRNA levels and PDGF protein production by endothelial cells either directly, or indirectly via cell cycle arrest at G0. This effect is not due to nonspecific cessation of cell growth because arresting the cells at S phase or in metaphase does not result in increased c-sis transcript levels."
https://openalex.org/W1495517783,"Abstract Tetanus toxin was found to be a potent inhibitor of neurosecretion in the rat pheochromocytoma cell line PC12, a system in which biochemical and functional studies could be performed in parallel. Incubation of the cells with 10 nM tetanus toxin (3 h) led to an inhibition of acetylcholine release by 75-80% when evoked by 200 microM veratridine, 1 mM carbachol, or 2 mM Ba2+. The main characteristics of the inhibition process are: 1) the toxin is very potent, with threshold doses of 10 pM; 2) the action of toxin is blocked at low temperature (0 degrees C) and by antitoxin; 3) the effects are dose- and time-dependent; 4) a concentration-dependent lag phase precedes the onset of the inhibitory effects. Thus the PC12 cultures are a valid system for studies on the underlying molecular process in tetanus action. This system was exploited by the use of long term incubation studies to examine the processes responsible for the lag phase. When cells were incubated with 0.1 nM 125I-tetanus toxin, cell-associated toxin reached a plateau of 16 fmol of toxin/mg of protein, yet the toxic effects did not appear until 12 h. Further, PC12 cells were found to rapidly internalize tetanus toxin, with a half-life of 1-2 min, once it was bound to the surface of the cells. Thus, the lag phase results from steps that occur in the intracellular compartment after internalization. An important discovery was that the differentiation state of the PC12 cells was a critical factor in determining sensitivity to tetanus toxin. Cells that were cultured with nerve growth factor for 8-12 days were very sensitive to toxin. In contrast, acetylcholine release from nondifferentiated, autodifferentiated, or dexamethasone-treated cultures was insensitive to tetanus toxin. Since differential expression of high affinity tetanus toxin receptors cannot explain these results, it is concluded that PC12 cells are capable of expressing different forms of excitation-secretion coupling mechanisms. Tetanus toxin should prove a valuable probe to further distinguish these processes."

Both [Glu1,8,Leu11,17] 18A and [Glu4,9,Leu11,17] reverse-18A strongly disrupt the bilayer structure as indicated by the relatively narrow lipid 1H and 31P NMR peaks. In addition, the 1H chemical shift of the quaternary ammonium methyl groups indicates that [Glu1,8,Leu11,17] 18A forms smaller lipoprotein particles with dimyristoylphosphatidylcholine (DMPC) than does [Glu4,9,Leu11,17] reverse-18A. However, motional properties of the lipid head group indicate that no specific salt bridges are formed between the phospholipid head group and the side chains of polar amino acids of either of the two peptides. In addition, the acyl chain conformation for the DMPC complexes with [Glu1,8,Leu11,17] 18A and with [Glu4,9,Leu11,17] reverse-18A are indistinguishable by the criterion of IR spectroscopy. The 2H linewidth of the solvent 2H2O remains narrower in frozen solutions of the DMPC-[Glu1,8,Leu11,17] 18A complexes suggesting the presence of more unfrozen bound water in this case. The two peptides exhibit many similarities in their interaction with lipids. However, [Glu1,8,Leu11,17] 18A can more readily lyse vesicles and activate lecithin:cholesterol acyltransferase. These differences do not appear to result from differences in specific charge interactions between the lipid and peptide but may be manifested through differences in hydration properties."
https://openalex.org/W1481356988,"In the liver, System A-mediated uptake of neutral amino acids may play a key role in metabolic control. Knowing the properties of the solubilized and reconstituted System A activity is important for future studies on the purification of the carrier protein. Solubilization of System A activity by the combination of 2.5% cholate and 4 M urea resulted in greater than 85% extraction of the activity. Previous removal of easily extracted plasma membrane proteins with 1% cholate alone followed by solubilization of the transporter with cholate/urea resulted in a 2-fold enrichment in transport activity. Based on the observation that the carrier protein aggregates in the presence of low detergent concentrations, a selective polyethylene glycol precipitation procedure was developed resulting in recovery of more than 70% of the initial transport activity and less than 10% of the total protein. A concomitant 10-fold enrichment in carrier activity was achieved. The precipitated carrier could be resuspended in buffer containing Triton X-100, asolectin, and glycerol. Transporter activity in this buffer was stable for up to 5 days when maintained at -20 degrees C or for 2 days at 4 degrees C. The general applicability of the devised reconstitution is illustrated by the presence of Systems N and Gly in the reconstituted proteoliposomes at specific activities greater than those in the native vesicles."

Pretreatment of the CTBP with NADP induced dithiothreitol (DTT)-dependent T3 binding. The DTT-dependent T3 binding was increased by NADP in a concentration-dependent manner, and the maximal binding was obtained by 0.1 microM NADP. Higher concentrations of NADP (more than 0.1 microM), however, reduced T3 binding. NAD also induced DTT-dependent T3 binding, but was very low compared to that induced by NADP. NADPH and NADH did not produce DTT-dependent T3 binding. This NADP-activated, DTT-dependent T3 binding was characterized as follows: Ka for T3 binding was 1.8 x 10(9) M-1, and the maximal binding capacity was 15,000 pmol/mg of protein in the CTBP activated by 0.1 microM NADP. The molecular weight of the CTBP was 58,000 (4.7 S). A complex of [125I]T3 and CTBP (NADP.DTT.CTBP.[125I]T3), which was made from the CTBP pretreated with NADP and DTT, did not bind to DNA. However, the complex bound to the nuclei prepared from rat kidney. Treatment of the nuclei with 0.38 M KCl and with DNase I did not lead to loss of the binding activity for the complex. Treatment of nuclei with 0.5 M NaCl led to the loss of the activity for binding the complex. A complex of [125I]T3 and NADPH-activated CTBP did not bind these nuclear preparations. These results suggested that the active form of CTBP is present in two different forms: one is NADPH-activated, which plays a role as a reservoir for cytoplasmic T3, and the other is NADP-activated, which plays a role as a T3 carrier protein that transfers T3 from cytoplasm to nucleus."

Purified CTBP had a sedimentation coefficient of 4.7 S, Stokes radius of 32.5A, and calculated molecular weight of 58,000. The apparently homogeneous protein consisted of a single polypeptide chain with Mr of 58,000 as estimated by sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. Scatchard analysis of T3 binding showed that NADPH increases maximal binding capacity without changes in the affinity constant (Ka = 2.43 X 10(9) M-1). Double reciprocal analysis of NADPH and binding capacity gave maximal binding capacity of 16,400 pmol/mg of CTBP, Mr = 58,000. The order of affinity of iodothyronine analogues to purified CTBP was as follows: L-T3 = D-T3 greater than triiodothyroacetic acid greater than L-thyroxine. [125I]T3 bound to purified CTBP spontaneously dissociated from CTBP at 20 degrees C (t 1/2 = 22 min) in the absence of NADPH, whereas the dissociation was not observed in the presence of NADPH. The optimal pH for T3 binding was 7.2-7.5 Na+, K+, Ca2+, and Mg2+ (0-200 mM) did not influence T3 binding to CTBP.

https://openalex.org/W1521172074,"Host specificity in the Rhizobium-legume symbiosis is controlled in the bacterium by host specific nodulation (hsn) genes residing on its symbiotic plasmid. We have examined the structure of the major acidic heteropolysaccharide produced by recombinant hybrid strains of Rhizobium leguminosarum carrying cloned R. trifolii hsn genes with those produced by the parent donor and recipient strains. Alteration of the nod gene composition of R. leguminosarum strain 300 by introduction of an 8-kilobase set of hsn genes (nodFERL and nodMN) from R. trifolii strain ANU843, resulted in a hybrid strain which conferred efficient white clover infection and nodulation, production of the R. trifolii-type acidic polysaccharide, and an increased proportion of bacterial cells which bound to the white clover lectin, trifoliin A, in the external root environment. 1H NMR studies indicated that the structure of the polysaccharide from the hybrid recombinant differed from that of the R. leguminosarum strain 300 recipient in site and stoichiometry of acetate and stoichiometry of 3-hydroxybutyrate substituents. In contrast, the polysaccharide from a different hybrid recombinant strain containing only R. trifolii nodFERL genes had the acetylation pattern of the R. leguminosarum recipient but was substituted with 3-hydroxybutyrate at a level between that made by R. trifolii and R. leguminosarum. This latter recombinant strain displays sparse infection and nodulation of white clover roots. Immunofluorescence studies indicated that the R. leguminosarum recombinant strain containing the full complement of R. trifolii hsn genes (nodFERL and nodMN) gained the ability to interact with the excreted lectin, trifoliin A, in the white clover root environment, whereas the recombinant strain containing R. trifolii nodFERL only, was significantly attenuated in this cell-lectin interaction. These results indicate that the acylation pattern of the acidic polysaccharide synthesized by these hybrid recombinants of R. leguminosarum is influenced by the introduced hsn genes of R. trifolii and suggest that the acidic polysaccharide of R. trifolii and the interaction of these bacteria with the host lectin may contribute to host specificity in the white clover-R. trifolii symbiosis."

Germin mRNA (1075 nucleotide residues) has an 85-residue 5'-untranslated sequence, a 69-residue sequence that can encode a 23-residue signal-peptide sequence, a 603-residue sequence that can encode a 201-residue mature-protein sequence, and a 318-residue 3'-untranslated sequence that begins with a UAA-terminator codon, ends with a 63-residue polyadenylate tract, and has three polyadenylation (and other, related) signals (AAUAAN etc.). One polyadenylation signal is just 9 nucleotides from the polyadenylation site, the shortest stretch of nucleotides yet found between polyadenylation signal and site in any animal or plant mRNA. The mature-protein coding sequence in germin mRNA contains an unusually high proportion (87%) of G + C in the third positions of its codons. The amino acid sequence of germin does not have extensive internal homologies or repetitions, and it is not characterized by regions of unusually high charge density, as is nucleoplasmin, another water-soluble homopentameric protein with otherwise closely related structural properties. Germin does, however, contain a stretch of 34 uncharged amino acid residues and these may possibly mediate its homopentameric structure and its remarkable resistance to enzymic proteolysis. In view of a possible association of germin with cellular membranes, the most interesting relatedness of the germin sequence to the sequences of other proteins is an 80% homology between a decapeptide sequence in mature germin and a decapeptide sequence in Escherichia coli glycerol-3-phosphate acyltransferase. The relation of germin-gene structure to overall gene regulation during early plant growth is discussed."

Scatchard analysis of 125I-human growth hormone binding to the purified receptor revealed two classes of specific binding sites with Ka = 18.5 x 10(9) and 1.2 x 10(9) M-1. Considering that both classes of binding sites are responsible for high affinity prolactin binding, the partially purified receptor preparation had a binding activity of 1.69 nmol/mg protein, representing 1000-fold purification over microsomal receptors with a recovery of 52%. From three separate purifications, 6 mg of partially purified prolactin receptor were obtained with a purity of approximately 4 to 6.5%. Thus, the use of monoclonal antibody for affinity chromatography resulted in a large improvement of prolactin receptor purification compared to previous hormone affinity chromatography (300-fold purification, 15% recovery). The purified receptor was run on preparative sodium dodecyl sulfate polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, and a homogeneous preparation of prolactin receptor was obtained by electroelution from gel slices corresponding to Mr 38,000-43,000. Immunoblot analysis using a radiolabeled monoclonal antibody revealed two separate but closely located bands of Mr 42,000 and 40,000 in microsomal, partially purified, and electroeluted preparations. The homogeneous receptor protein was extensively digested with L-1-tosylamido-2-phenylethyl chloromethyl ketone trypsin, and 10 internal amino acid sequences of the rat liver prolactin receptor were determined by gas-phase sequence analysis. Oligonucleotide probes were prepared against two of these internal sequences, and a prolactin receptor cDNA was isolated from a rat liver library using one of these probes (Boutin, J.

The amino acid sequence deduced from the cDNA reveals three potential sites of N-linked glycosylation, two of which were confirmed during protein sequencing. The prolactin receptor was characterized by affinity labeling with 125I-human growth hormone. Cross-linking of microsomes revealed a single band for the hormone-receptor complex with Mr 62,000. On the other hand, cross-linking of Triton X-100-solubilized or partially purified receptor with labeled hormone resulted in the appearance of two bands with Mr 62,000 and 102,000, suggesting the existence of a subunit structure of the prolactin receptor, or alternatively, the existence of two types of prolactin receptor.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)"
https://openalex.org/W1950136012,"Abstract During the acute phase response to inflammation the plasma concentration of some proteins, such as alpha(1-acid glycoprotein (AGP), increases dramatically. Since breakdown and remodeling of tissue is common to both nidation and inflammation we studied the tissue distribution and regulation of AGP mRNA levels during the embryonic development of the rat. High levels of mRNA coding for AGP were detected in the placenta during early fetal development. Expression of this mRNA was confined to the decidua and was first observed approximately 1 day after implantation when proliferation of the decidua is already well advanced. Maximum levels were attained about 5 days after implantation, after which the levels decreased rapidly. In contrast to the high levels of AGP mRNA in the decidua only very low levels were detected in fetal liver and visceral yolk sac, and there was only a small increase in the levels in maternal liver. Corticosteroid hormone responsiveness of AGP mRNA synthesis by hepatocytes appeared 3 days before birth. It is likely that the synthesis of AGP by the cells of the decidua is important in establishing the precisely controlled interaction between mother and embryo during nidation."

Upon incubation of reticulocytes with 8-bromo-cAMP, phosphorylation of threonyl-tRNA synthetase is stimulated approximately 2-fold, an increase similar to that observed with ribosomal protein S6. To analyze the effects of phosphorylation on activity, threonyl-tRNA synthetase has been purified to apparent homogeneity from rabbit reticulocytes utilizing a four-step purification procedure with the simultaneous purification of seryl-tRNA synthetase. Both synthetases are phosphorylated in vitro by the cAMP-dependent protein kinase. Prior to phosphorylation, the two synthetases produce significant amounts of P1, P4-bis(5'-adenosyl)-tetraphosphate (Ap4A) in the presence of the cognate amino acid and ATP, with activities comparable to that of lysyl-tRNA synthetase. Phosphorylation has no effect on aminoacylation, but an increase in Ap4A synthesis of up to 6-fold is observed with threonyl-tRNA synthetase and 2-fold with seryl-tRNA synthetase. Thus, cAMP-mediated phosphorylation of specific aminoacyl-tRNA synthetases appears to be a potential mode of regulation of Ap4A synthesis in mammals."
https://openalex.org/W1836780958,"Abstract Monoiodotyrosine (MIT) crosses the lysosomal membrane of rat FRTL-5 thyroid cells by a carrier-mediated process. In egress studies, MIT lost from inside lysosomes was quantitatively recovered outside lysosomes as MIT, indicating that the compound was transported intact across the lysosomal membrane. In uptake studies, [125I]MIT entry required intact lysosomes and exhibited saturation kinetics. The apparent Km for MIT was approximately 1.5 microM and the Vmax was approximately 0.24 pmol/unit hexosaminidase/min. Countertransport of MIT was demonstrated, with an initial velocity of [125I]MIT uptake which reached a maximum at high intralysosomal MIT loading. Nonradioactive MIT and diiodotyrosine competed to approximately equivalent extents with [125I]MIT for uptake in countertransport experiments. The existence of a lysosomal MIT carrier in thyroid cells may explain how this product of thyroglobulin catabolism is transported to the cytosol for iodine salvage and reutilization."
https://openalex.org/W1600329711,"Abstract We have purified a protein with hemagglutinating activity from the seeds of a West African legume, Bowringia milbraedii. The purified protein, designated BMA, has a native Mr = 38,000 on gel filtration and a subunit size of Mr = 16,000 by sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis under reducing or nonreducing conditions. Hemagglutination was inhibited most effectively by Man alpha 1----2 linked sugars. Affinity chromatography of oligosaccharides on BMA-Sepharose showed that Man alpha 1----2Man alpha 1----2Man alpha 1----3Man beta 1----4GlcNAcol (where GlcNAcol is N-acetylglucosaminitol) and Man alpha 1----2Man alpha 1----3Man beta 1----4GlcNAcol were retarded on the column, whereas Man alpha 1----3Man beta 1----4GlcNAcol did not bind. Oligomannosidic-type glycans obtained by treatment of [3H] mannose-labeled baby hamster kidney cells with endo-beta-N-acetylglucosaminidase H bound more strongly to BMA-Sepharose and required 10 or 200 mM methyl-alpha-mannoside for elution. Oligosaccharides bearing the sequence Man alpha 1----2Man alpha 1----6Man alpha 1----6Man, i.e. Man9GlcNAc and certain isomers of Man8GlcNAc and Man7GlcNAc, bound more tightly than other Man8 GlcNAc and Man7GlcNAc isomers lacking this sequence. Man6GlcNAc and Man5GlcNAc were weakly bound. These results suggest that BMA binds preferentially to glycoproteins that are subjected to early steps of oligosaccharide processing in the endoplasmic reticulum but not to glycoproteins that are exposed to more extensive processing by Golgi mannosidases. Staining of permeabilized cells with BMA-chromophore conjugates revealed a reticular cytoplasmic pattern consistent with a preferential visualization of the endoplasmic reticulum. BMA staining was less evident in the juxtanuclear regions that were stained brightly with wheat germ agglutinin, a lectin that binds preferentially to sialylated glycoproteins located in Golgi compartments."
https://openalex.org/W1559993597,"Abstract Recent studies have described a DNase I hypersensitive site in the 5'-flanking region of the rat hepatic S14 gene that is closely associated with its expression. A 111-base pair subfragment (-389 to -279) of this region interacts specifically in a gel shift assay with a protein present in hepatic nuclear protein extracts. This protein, designated P1, was not present in extracts of other tissues, even those in which the gene is expressed and hormonally regulated. The binding activity of P1 is exceedingly low in extracts from hypothyroid rats and is markedly increased by administration of thyroid hormone. However, the slow accumulation of P1 after thyroid hormone administration indicates that increased levels of P1 are not necessary for the acute hormonal induction of S14 gene expression. The level of P1 binding activity increases in the evening, synchronous with circadian variation of hepatic mRNA S14. Since neither P1 binding activity nor circadian variation in mRNA-S14 levels are observed in the other tissues expressing the S14 gene, P1 may function to modulate the circadian rhythm observed in hepatic S14 gene expression. DNase I footprinting analysis revealed that P1 binds to a defined nucleotide sequence, 5'-AAAAGAGCTATTGATTGCCTGCA-3', located between -310 and -288 in the S14 gene."
https://openalex.org/W127854460,"(11S,12S)-Epoxy-5,14-cis-7,9-trans-eicosatetraenoic acid (11,12-leukotriene A4) was nonenzymically converted to seven compounds: two diastereomers of (12S)-hydroxyeicosatetraeno-delta-lactones (major products), two diastereomers of (5,12S)-dihydroxyeicosatetraenoic acid and three stereoisomers of (11,12S)-dihydroxyeicosatetraenoic acid. Among these compounds, (11R,12S)-dihydroxy-5,14-cis-7,9-trans-eicosatetraenoic acid proved to be the only enzymic product. This hydrolysis activity was present in the cytosol fractions of various tissues of guinea pig such as liver, adrenal gland, small intestine, and brain. We purified the epoxide hydrolase to an apparent homogeneity from the guinea pig liver. The enzyme had a molecular weight of 60,000 as determined by sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, and an isoelectric point of 7.3. The partial amino acid sequence was different from that of the microsomal enzyme. Km and Vmax values for 11,12-leukotriene A4 were 18 microM and 2.4 mumol/min/mg protein, respectively. These results indicate that 11,12-dihydroxyeicosatetraenoic acid is enzymically synthesized from 11,12-leukotriene A4 by the action of the cytosolic epoxide hydrolase in vitro."
https://openalex.org/W1515144353,"Hepatic lipid synthesis was verified and studied in lysolecithin-permeabilized cultured rat hepatocytes and compared to that of intact liver cells. Triacylglycerol synthesis in permeabilized cells incubated in the presence of glycerol 3-phosphate and long chain fatty acids approached that of intact hepatocytes. Similarly, phosphatidylcholine synthesis in permeable cells incubated in the presence of exogenous CDP-choline was similar to that of intact hepatocytes and at the expense of microsomal neutral lipid synthesis. Phosphatidic acid accumulation in lysolecithin-permeabilized liver cells was remarkably increased as compared to that of intact cells, and its synthesis was mostly accounted for by the activity of mitochondrial glycerol-3-phosphate acyltransferase. Mitochondrial-generated phosphatidate was found to migrate to the endoplasmic reticulum, thus establishing a novel lipid esterification pathway which begins in mitochondrial glycerol 3-phosphate acylation and results in microsomal triacylglycerol and phospholipid synthesis. The free access of permeabilized liver cells to substrates and modulators of lipid synthesis, while maintaining an overall synthetic pattern similar to that of intact hepatocytes, makes them a system of choice for studying hepatic lipid synthesis in general and the microsomal/mitochondrial distribution of fluxes in particular."
https://openalex.org/W1506763963,"Abstract The distal upstream region of the fibroin gene, -238 to -73, is known to contain the cis-acting element(s) responsible for tissue-specific transcription enhancement in vitro. To identify factor(s) trans-acting on this region, we have developed a modified nitrocellulose blot protein-DNA binding procedure that detects DNA-protein complexes via protein-protein interaction. A protein that does not bind to DNA as a monomer cannot be detected by standard Southwestern blotting. To detect protein-DNA complexes involving both protein-DNA and protein-protein interactions, the protein blot was reacted with the extract protein to form a protein complex on the filter, in the presence of the DNA probe. This new method revealed that the 75-kDa protein binds to the enhancer region of the fibroin gene in the presence of the second protein(s). The 75-kDa protein and the factor(s) mediating DNA binding activity were recovered in two different column fractions. The level of the 75-kDa protein appeared to be much higher in silk gland extracts than in nonsilk gland extracts, whereas the mediating factor(s) distributed evenly. These observations suggest that the distal upstream region of the fibroin gene can be specifically recognized by a protein complex composed of at least two distinct proteins, through protein-protein interaction."
https://openalex.org/W1483495368,"Biotin-binding protein I (BBP-I), a protein that differs in its heat stability at low concentrations from that of BBP-II, has been purified from the yolk of hen oocytes and compared to BBP-II. Rabbit antiserum to BBP-II cross-reacts with identity to BBP-I. The molecular mass of BBP-I under denaturing conditions is about 68 kDa, a value four times that of BBP-II. Limited trypsin proteolysis of BBP-I generates subunits of 18 kDa with intermediate forms of approximately 51 and 34 kDa. The NH2-terminal sequence of BBP-I is very similar to that of BBP-II but has little of the polymorphism that is presumed to be generated at several positions by the slightly different subunits of BBP-II. These results indicate an unusual processing pathway in which four tandemly repeated biotin-binding domains of BBP-I become the subunits of BBP-II after limited proteolysis."
https://openalex.org/W1547736514,"Steady state and rapid reaction kinetics of the flavoprotein anthranilate hydroxylase (EC 1.14.12.2) have been examined with the nonhydroxylated substrate analogue, salicylate. Since the reaction with salicylate does not involve events in which aromatic substrate is oxygenated, it provides a simpler model for studying the hysteresis exhibited by this enzyme. It is shown that the first turnover of the enzyme is slower than subsequent turnovers owing in part to slow initial binding reactions of salicylate with the enzyme. The reductive half-reaction of the first turnover is also slow since rapid reduction of the enzyme flavin requires bound aromatic substrate. The oxidative half-reaction involves reaction of the reduced enzyme-salicylate complex with oxygen to form a flavin C4a-hydroperoxide, which then decays to oxidized flavoenzyme and H2O2. Several lines of evidence indicate that salicylate remains bound to the enzyme at the end of the catalytic cycle so that in turnovers subsequent to the first, the slow steps involving salicylate binding are avoided."
https://openalex.org/W1568613781,"Abstract Ornithine decarboxylase from Lactobacillus 30a is representative of the large subunit (80 kDa), oligomeric, pyridoxal phosphate-dependent amino-acid decarboxylases. Yellow crystals of ornithine decarboxylase are obtained from polyethylene glycol solutions and belong to space group P6 with unit cell constants a = b = 194.9 and c = 97.44 A, alpha = beta = 90 degrees and gamma = 120 degrees, V = 3.21 x 10(6) A3. Still photographs show reflections at better than 2.4-A resolution. Electron micrographs reported by Guirard and Snell (Guirard, B.M., and Snell, E.E. (1980) J. Biol. Chem. 255, 5960-5964) reveal that the ornithine decarboxylase dodecamer is a hexagonally shaped particle with a point-to-point distance of approximately 210 A and a thickness of approximately 70 A. The crystallographic unit cell can thus accommodate one 10(6)-Da dodecamer (Vm = 3.2 A3/Da), implying that a dimer occupies an asymmetric unit. Tanaka rotation function analysis, using native data (5-7 A) collected from three crystals, reveals that the particle has the expected 622 molecular symmetry with molecular 2-fold axes lying at 20 degrees and 50 degrees from a in the a-b plane. A search for suitable heavy atom derivatives is underway."
https://openalex.org/W1999880077,"Abstract A novel class of glycolipids, assigned the trivial name blaberosides, was isolated from whole head tissues of the giant cockroach (Blaberus colosseus). The class consists of two closely related families, blaberoside I and blaberoside II, each containing species differing by 26 atomic mass units. The structure of these gentiobiose-based glycoglycerolipids was elucidated by chromatographic behavior, nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy, mass spectrometry, and analysis of chemical degradation products and derivatives. Species in the blaberoside I family have been identified as 2-O-[6'-O-(6-O-3-hydroxy-11-eicosenoyl-beta-D-glucopyranosyl)-bet a-D- glucopyranosyl]-3-(hexadecyloxy)-1-(3-hydroxy-11-eicosenoyl)-1,2-p ropanediol (blaberoside Ia) and 2-O-[6'-O-(6-O-3-hydroxy-11-eicosenoyl-beta-D-glucopyranosyl)-bet a- D-glucopyranosyl]-3-(6-octadeceloxy)-1-(3-hydroxy-11-eicosenoyl )-1,2- propanediol (blaberoside Ib). Two smaller homologs of the blaberoside II family were discerned to be 2-O-[6'-O-(6-O-3-hydroxy-11- eicosenoyl-beta-D-glucopyranosyl)-beta-D-glucopyranosyl]-3-(hex ade cyloxy)- 1,2-propanediol (blaberoside IIa), and 2-O-[6'-O-(6-O-3-hydroxy-11-eicosenoyl-beta-D- glucopyranosyl)-beta-D-glucopyranosyl]-3-(4-octadeceloxy)-1,2-prop anediol (blaberoside IIb). These compounds are unique because they are animal origin glyceroglycolipids with a highly flexible gentiobiose backbone, and a beta-linkage of the carbohydrate to the glycerol ether at the 2 position rather than the usual 1 position."
