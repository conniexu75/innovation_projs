https://openalex.org/W2084106399,"Recombinant bacterial plasmids have been constructed that contain complementary DNA prepared from rat islets of Langerhans messenger RNA. Three plasmids contain cloned sequences representing the complete coding region of rat proinsulin I, part of the preproinsulin I prepeptide, and the untranslated 3' terminal region of the mRNA. A fourth plasmid contains sequences derived from the A chain region of rat preproinsulin II."

https://openalex.org/W2151591460,"Transformed cells lack a large, external, transformation-sensitive (LETS) glycoprotein which is a major surface component of their normal counter-parts. Addition of LETS glycoprotein isolated from normal cells to transformed cells restores certain morphological features and adhesive properties characteristic of normal cells. LETS protein is detected on the cell surface both by iodination using lactoperoxidase and by immunofluorescent staining. The surface distribution pattern detected by immunofluorescence is strikingly similar to that of normal cells. After addition of LETS protein, transformed cells also exhibit well defined actin cables which are not seen in untreated, transformed cells. All these alterations can be blocked by treating LETS protein with specific antisera or by subjecting it to mild trypsinization prior to addition to transformed cells. The effects are rapidly reversible by mild trypsinization, which removes the added LETS protein. The high rate of uptake of 2-deoxyglucose, characteristic of transformed cells, is not affected by LETS protein. These results suggest that LETS protein may have a role in cell attachment and spreading, and affect the organization of cytoskeleton."

https://openalex.org/W1569556111,"Agents known to inphorylation of specific endogenous proteins in intact synaptosomes from rat brain. Synaptosome preparations, preincubated in vitro with 32Pi, incorporated 32P into a variety of specific proteins. Veratridine and high (60 mM) K+, which increase Ca2+ transport across membranes, through a mechanism involving membrane depolarization, as well as the calcium ionophore A23187, each markedly stimulated the incorporation of 32P into two specific proteins (80,000 and 86,000 daltons) as determined by sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and autoradiography. All three agents failed to stimulate protein phosphorylation in calcium-free medium containing ethylene glycol bis(beta-aminoethyl ether) N,N'-tetraacetic acid (EGTA). Moreover, the Ca2+-dependent protein phosphorylation could be reversed by the addition of sufficient EGTA to chelate all free extracellular Ca2+. Veratridine, high K+, and A23187 also stimulated 45Ca2+ accumulation by synaptosomes. Tetrodotoxin blocked the stimulation both of protein phosphorylation and of 45Ca2+ accumulation by veratridine but not by high K+ or A23187. Cyclic nucleotides and several putative neurotransmitters were without effect on protein phosphorylation in these intact synaptosome preparations. The absence of any endogenous protein phosphorylation in osmotically shocked synaptosome preparations incubated with 32Pi, and the inability of added [gamma-32P]ATP to serve as a substrate for veratridine-stimulated protein phosphorylation in intact preparations, indicated that the Ca2+-dependent protein phosphorylation occurred within intact subcellular organelles. Fractionation of a crude synaptosome preparation on a discontinuous Ficoll/sucrose flotation gradient indicated that these organelles were synaptosomes rather than mitochondria. The data suggest that conditions which cause an accumulation of calcium by synaptosomes lead to a calcium-dependent increase in phosphorylation of specific endogenous proteins. These phosphoproteins may be involved in the regulation of certain calcium-dependent nerve terminal functions such as neurotransmitter synthesis and release."
https://openalex.org/W1579455946,"Tunicamycin, an antibiotic which blocks the formation of N-acetylglucosamine-lipid intermediates, thereby preventing glycosylation of glycoproteins, inhibits the secretion of IgA and IgE by MOPC 315 mouse plasma cells and IR162 rat plasma cells, respectively. At 0.5 microng of tunicamycin per ml, D-[14C]glucosamine incorporation into newly synthesized immunoglobulin was inhibited greater than 90% while the overall rate of protein synthesized was much less inhibited (40% in the case of MOPC 315 cells and 13% in the case of IR162 cells). This dose of tunicamycin produced an 85% inhibition of IgA secretion by the MOPC 315 cells and a complete inhibition of intact IgE secretion by the IR162 plasma cells. In contrast, tunicamycin had little effect on the secretion of normally nonglycosylated lambda light chains or on cell-free protein synthesis, demonstrating that tunicamycin is not a general inhibitor of protein synthesis or a non-specific inhibitor of protein secretion. No enhancement of intracellular degradation of nonglycosylated immunoglobulin could be demonstrated. Electron microscopy of tunicamycin-treated MOPC 315 cells revealed marked dilatations of the rough endoplasmic reticulum, and direct immunofluorescence indicated that the dilated rought endoplasmic reticulum contained IgA. These data indicate that glycosylation of newly synthesized IgA and IgE may be necessary for normal secretion to occur."
https://openalex.org/W1492772411,"Mutants of Saccharomyces cerevisiae were isolated which were blocked in heme biosynthesis and required heme for growth on a nonfermentable carbon source. They were rho+, and grew fermentatively on ergosterol or cholesterol and Tween 80, as a source of oleic acid. Cells grown on ergosterol and Tween 80 lacked cytochromes and catalase which were restored by growth on heme. The mutants comprised five nonoverlapping complementation groups. Tetrad analysis showed that the pleiotropic properties of each of the mutants resulted from a single mutation in one of five unlinked loci (hem1 to hem5) affecting heme biosynthesis. Biochemical studies confirmed that each mutation resulted in loss of a single enzyme activity. hem1 mutants grew on delta-aminolevulinate and lacked delta-aminolevulinate synthase activity, hem2 mutants lacked delta-aminolevulinate dehydratase, and hem3 mutants uroporphyrin I synthase. Mutants in hem1, hem2, and hem3 had an additional requirement for methionine on synthetic medium supplemented with either heme or ergosterol and Tween 80, owing to a lack of sulfite reductase which contains siroheme, a modified uroporphyrin III. Since hem4 and hem5 mutants have sulfite reductase activity under all growth conditions, they are blocked after uroporphyrin III. Cell extracts of a hem4 mutant incubated with delta-aminolevulinate accumulated coproporphyrin III suggesting a block in coproporphyrinogenase, the enzyme which converts coproporphyrinogen III to protoporphyrinogen. Cells and extracts of a hem5 mutant accumulated protoporphyrin IX. Since it was the only mutant that grew on heme but not on protoporphyrin IX, a block in ferrochelatase was suggested for this strain. Mutant strains grown on heme had the sterol composition of wild type cells, whereas without heme only squalene, small amounts of lanosterol, and added sterol was observed. A heme product therefore participates in the transformation of lanosterol to ergosterol. A hem3 mutant was isolated which was also blocked between 2,3-oxidosqualene and lanosterol (erg12). When grown on lanosterol or ergosterol (with Tween 80) it accumulated a compound which was identified as 2,3-oxidosqualene by comparison with the synthetic compound in thin layer and gas-liquid chromatography, and by proton magnetic resonance and mass spectroscopy. Supplementation with heme did not remove the requirement for sterol, but it enabled the mutant to convert lanosterol to ergosterol."
https://openalex.org/W1590585236,"Because 50% of the mass of the external invertase of Saccharomyces cerevisiae consists of carbohydrate, it has been extremely difficult to obtain an accurate molecular weight of this enzyme by centrifugal or electrophoretic techniques. However, on removing almost all of the oligosaccharide chains of this enzyme with the endo-beta-N-acetyl-glucosaminidase H from Streptomyces plicatus, it has been possible to show that carbohydrate-free invertase is composed of two 60,000-dalton subunits. Terminal sequence analysis with carboxypeptidases A, B, and Y provided strong evidence that the subunits are identical."

Evidence was obtained that a protein immunochemically related to prolactin was stored in networks of nerve terminals of many hypothalamic areas such as the arcuate nucleus, the dorsomedial hypothalamic nucleus, and periventricular regions of the hypothalamus and preoptic area. The neuronal storage of a prolactin-like protein in the hypothalamus was unaffected by hypophysectomy."
https://openalex.org/W2071277496,"Fourteen schizophrenic patients and five patients with affective disorders were given naloxone (0.4 to 10 milligrams) or placebo intravenously in a double-blind fashion. Physicians' ratings of hallucinations, mannerisms and posturing, conceptual disorganization, psychosis, and mood did not change significantly. A single item, unusual thought content, improved significantly on the naloxone day compared to the placebo day. There was no improvement in mood in affectively ill patients rated either by themselves or by physicians. Naloxone did not markedly improve any patient studied, which suggests that the acute blockade of opiate receptors is not associated with global improvement in psychotic symptomatology."
https://openalex.org/W1595657386,"Evidence is presented that a methyltransferase enzyme, previously shown to be necessary for chemotaxis and identified as the cheR gene product, catalyzes the formation of a gamma-glutamyl methyl ester in one or more membrane proteins of Salmonella typhimurium. The rates of release of methyl label from the methylated protein in acid, base, and hydroxylamine are consistent with a methyl ester and not with a methylated imidazole, guanidino, or amino group. A gamma-glutamyl methyl ester was isolated from a proteolytic digest of the modified protein."
https://openalex.org/W1543686981,"A comparison of isogenic RNase III+ and RNase III- strains of Escherichia coli shows that although both synthesize precursor and mature 16 S and 23 S ribosomal RNAs, the transient rRNA species of the RNase III- strain differ from those of the RNase III+ strain. The RNase III+ strain synthesizes p16 and rRNA, whereas the RNase III- strain produces unstable 17 S, 18 S, p23, 25 S and 30 S RNA molecules. The 30 S RNA, which is a primary transcript of the ribosomal RNA gene cluster, does not contribute significantly to any of the smaller RNAs, nor is m23 rRNA derived from 25 S but rather from p23 RNA. Mature 16 S rRNA is derived from both 18 S and 17 S RNA, and 17 S RNA can be derived from 18 S. Additionally, an unstable RNA species about 300 bases long is missing in the RNase III- strain and another species which seems to be about 50 bases larger appears. Processing of the primary ribosomal RNA transcript in RNase III- strains of Escherichia coli is accomplished during its transcription by two independent pathways which are not so utilized in RNase III+ strains. One pathway yields 18 S and precursor 23 S RNAs which are processed to mature rRNAs; the second pathway yields 25 S RNA and perhaps 16 S rRNA. The second pathway, unlike the first, is inhibited by chloramphenicol treatment. At slow rates of ribosomal RNA synthesis, the nascent transcript is processed preferentially by the first pathway. We suggest that in the absence of RNase III, which is involved in the primary processing of rRNA in E. coli, other enzymes involved in primary and secondary processing of rRNA in RNase III+ cells can recognize their sites on the nascent rRNA transcript and accomplish the primary processing."

The population was sampled at the end of the feeding period and compared to an adjacent population receiving no grass supplements. All of the experimental females were pregnant, while animals from the control area remained in nonbreeding condition. Replication of the experiment during the next winter produced similar results. The data suggest that Microtus montanus cues reproductive effort from chemical signals in the plant food resources."
https://openalex.org/W1969809817,"In E. coli cells, accumulation of ppGpp is normally triggered by conditions that restrict the aminoacylation of tRNA or interfere with carbon/energy source metabolism; in both cases, the nucleotide's accumulation is associated with control of stable RNA synthesis and is generally believed to bring it about. We have found an anomalous situation wherein vigorously growing cells accumulate a high level of ppGpp and there is no restriction of stable RNA synthesis. This occurs when wild-type cells are shifted up from an abnormally low growth temperature to one in the optimal range (35 degrees C-40 degrees C). The effect is partly, but not entirely, dependent upon the presence of a functional relA gene product. These results appear to call into question the simpler interpretations of the role of ppGpp in the control of stable RNA synthesis."

https://openalex.org/W1525979122,"Yeast DNA-dependent RNA polymerases I, II, and III are phosphorylated in vivo. Yeast cells were grown continuously in 32Pi and the RNA polymerases were isolated by a new procedure which allows the simultaneous purification of these enzymes from small quantities (35 to 60 g) of cells. Each of the RNA polymerases was phosphorylated. The following phosphorylated polymerase polypeptides were identified: polymerase I subunits of 185,000, 44,000, 36,000, 24,000, and 20,000 daltons; a polymerase II subunit of 24,000 daltons; and polymerase III subunits of 24,000 and 20,000 daltons. The incorporated 32P was acid-stable but base-labile. Phosphoserine and phosphothreonine were identified after partial acid hydrolysis of purified [32P]polymerase I. A yeast protein kinase that co-purifies with polymerase I during part of the isolation procedure was partially purified and characterized. This protein kinase phosphorylates the subunits of the purified polymerases that are phosphorylated in vivo and, in addition, a polymerase I subunit of 48,000 daltons and a polymerase II subunit of 33,500 daltons. Phosphorylation of the purified enzymes with this protein kinase had no substantial effect on polymerase activity in simple assays using native yeast DNA as a template. Preincubation of purified polymerase I with acid or alkaline phosphatase also had no detectable effect on polymerase activity."

https://openalex.org/W2012115177,"ALTHOUGH the ecological role of bacterial chemotaxis has been the object of considerable speculation, little is known of its role in nature1. Moreover, chemotaxis as a factor in the interaction between the mammalian host and its indigenous or pathogenic microflora remains unexplored. Studies with Vibrio cholerae and other intestinal pathogens have shown that bacterial association with the mucosa is influenced by bacterial motility, adhesion to brush border membranes, the presence of an indigenous flora and by the inhibitory effects of local antibodies (summarised in refs 2, 3). We have shown previously that a pepsin digest of rabbit intestinal mucosa (PMS) inhibits the association of cholera vibrios and Salmonella enteritidis with rabbit intestine, and speculated that this extract was inhibitory because it neutralised the adhesion of the bacteria to a hypothetical receptor in the mucus gel3. We report here that PMS neutralises a positive chemotactic response of several bacterial species to the mucosa and in that way reduces bacterial association with intestinal tissue. Chemotaxis thus seems to be one of several mechanisms controlling interactions of bacteria with mucosal surfaces."
https://openalex.org/W1589447451,The transport of methylamine (methylammonium ion) and ammonia (ammonium ion) is accomplished in Saccharomyces cerevisiae by means of a specific active transport system. L-Amino acids are noncompetitive inhibitors of methylamine transport. This inhibition is relieved or eliminated in mutant strains that have a reduced ability to transport amino acids. The inhibition of methylamine transport occurs immediately upon the addition of amino acids to the assay system and persists until the external amino acid pool is depleted. The degree of inhibition observed is a direct function of the rate of amino acid transport. Both methylamine and ammonia are capable of inhibiting amino acid transport. The inhibition of amino acid transport is eliminated in mutant strains that cannot transport methylamine and ammonia.

https://openalex.org/W1524119113,"The kinetics of the de novo formation of pyrimidine deoxyribonucleotides is the same after infection by wild type bacteriophage T4, which generate very low steady state levels of deoxytibonucleotides, and by T4 DNA synthesis-negative mutatants (Dna-), which accumulate high levels, suggesting that the control is not by a feedback mechanism. In this study, the ratio of the de novo synthesis of dTMP to HmdCMP derivatives was measured by determining the total thymine and 5-hydroxylxytosine (HmCyt) deoxyribonucleotides synthesized by the reductive pathways from [6-3H]uracil including those in DNA and any degradation products excreted into the medium. The ratio of the de novo synthesis of Thy/HmCyt derivatives remained constant at 2.1 +/- 0.1 for at least 45 min after infection by wild type phage, i.e. precisely at the Thy/HmCyt ratio in T4 DNA. On infection by phage mutated in the Dna-genes 32, 41, 44, or 45, the ratio still remained close to 2 to 1 for at least 25 min. Only after the pyrimidine deoxyribonucleotide concentrations reached levels about 100-fold greater than the initial values did the ratio begin to increase. However, a mutant of the structural gene for T4 DNA polymerase showed some increase in ratio by 15 min. Mutants of gene 1 (HmdCMP kinase) were distinct in that the Thy/HmCyt ratio dropped to about 1.0 by 25 min, and then remained quite constant. Uniquely, in these mutants a significant quantity of 5-hydroxymethyluracil or a derivative was found, about 40% being in the medium. The product was shown to be derived by deamination of a 5-HmCyt derivative. All Dna- mutants tested excreted 35 to 50% of their thymine derivatives, mostly as thymine, into the medium. Neither thymine nor 5-hydroxymethyluracil derivates were excreted after wild type phage infection. We propose that pyrimidine deoxyribonucleotide synthesis is regulated at a Thy:HmCyt ratio of 2:1 as an intrinsic property of a complex of enzymes synthesizing and channeling deoxyribonucleotides for T4 DNA replication and not exclusively by effector-sensitive mechanisms."

https://openalex.org/W1565023424,"The reaction of phenylglyoxal with aspartate transcarbamylase and its isolated catalytic subunit results in complete loss of enzymatic activity (Kantrowitz, E. R., and Lipscomb, W. N. (1976) J. Biol. Chem. 251, 2688-2695). If N-(phosphonacetyl)-L-aspartate is used to protect the active site, we find that phenylglyoxal causes destruction of the enzyme's susceptibility to activation by ATP and inhibition by CTP. Furthermore, CTP only minimally protects the regulatory site from reaction with this reagent. The modified enzyme still binds CTP although with reduced affinity. After reaction with phenylglyoxal, the native enzyme shows reduced cooperativity. The hybrid with modified regulatory subunits and native catalytic subunits exhibits slight heterotropic or homotropic properties, while the reverse hybrid, with modified catalytic subunits and native regulatory subunits, shows much reduced homotropic properties but practically normal heterotropic interactions. The decrease in the ability of CTP to inhibit the enzyme correlates with the loss of 2 arginine residues/regulatory chain (Mr = 17,000). Under these reaction conditions, 1 arginine residue is also modified on each catalytic chain (Mr = 33,000). Reaction rate studies of p-hydroxymercuribenzoate, with the liganded and unliganded modified enzyme suggest that the reaction with phenylglyoxal locks the enzyme into the liganded conformation. The conformational state of the regulatory subunit is implicated as having a critical role in the expression of the enzyme's heterotropic and homotropic properties."

https://openalex.org/W1544553598,"The 19F NMR spectrum of Escherichia coli tRNA1Val in which [5-19F]uridine replaces 93% of all uridine and uridine-derived residues has been examined at 93.6 and 235 MHz. The resolution of 11 peaks and visibility of two additional shoulders at either frequency for the 14 FUra residues in the molecule attests to the excellence of 19F as a probe for the structure of tRNA1Val in solution. No significant gain in resolution was attained at the higher frequency. A comparison of the relative areas in the different regions of the 19F spectrum of mixed [FUra]tRNAs with that of [FUra]tRNA1Val suggests that the three single resonances at lowest field in the region 86.5 to 88.5 ppm upfield from trifluoroacetate correspond to the three invariant bases which form tertiary hydrogen bonds in all tRNAs, namely, 8 (U or s4U), 54 (T), and 55 (phi) in unsubstituted tRNAs."

https://openalex.org/W1517343911,"A modified form of aspartate transcarbamylase is synthesized by Escherichia coli in the presence of 2-thiouracil which does not exhibit homotropic cooperative interactions between active sites yet retains heterotropic cooperative interactions due to nucleotide binding. The conformational changes induced in the modified enzyme by the binding of different ligands (substrates, substrate analogs, a transition state analog, and nucleotide effectors) were studied using ultraviolet absorbance and circular dichroism difference spectroscopy. Comparison of the results for the modified enzyme and its isolated subunits to those for the native enzyme and its isolated subunits showed that the conformational changes detected by these methods are qualitatively similar in the two enzymes. Comparison of the absorbance difference spectra due to the binding of a transition substrate analog to the intact native or modified enzymes to the corresponding results for the isolated subunits suggested that ligand binding causes an increased exposure to solvent of certain tyrosyl and phenylalanyl residues in the intact enzymes but not in the isolated subunits. This result is consistent with a diminution of subunit contacts due to substrate binding in the course of homotropic interactions in the native enzyme. Such conformational changes, though perhaps necessary for homotropic cooperativity, are not sufficient to cause homotropic cooperativity since the modified enzyme gave identical perturbations. Interactions of the transition state analog, N-(phosphonacetyl)-L-aspartate, with the modified enzyme were studied. Enzyme kinetic data obtained at low aspartate concentrations showed that this transition state analog does not stimulate activity, but rather exhibits the inhibition predicted for the total absence of homotropic cooperative interactions in the modified enzyme. Spectrophotometric titrations of the number of catalytic sites with the transition state analog showed that the modified enzyme and its isolated subunits possess, respectively, four and two high affinity sites for the inhibitor instead of six and three observed in the case of the normal enzyme and its isolated catalytic subunits. These results are correlated with the lower specific enzymatic activities of the modified enzyme and its catalytic subunits compared to the normal corresponding enzymatic species."
https://openalex.org/W1556644053,"Antibodies specific for N6-methyladenosine (m6A) and for 7-methylguanosine (m7G) were immobilized on Sepharose and the resulting immunoadsorbents tested for their ability to retain specific oligonucleotides possessing the corresponding antigenic haptens (i.e. m6A and m7G). Results obtained with oligonucleotides derived from ribonuclease T1 digests of Escherichia coli tRNA (previously labeled with [methyl-3H]methionine) indicated that each immunoadsorbent quantitatively and exclusively retained those methyl-3H-labeled oligonucleotides possessing [methyl-3H]m6A and [methyl-3H]m7G. Elution and subsequent characterization of the retained methyl-3H-labeled oligonucleotides via DEAE-cellulose chromatography revealed the presence of several small oligonucleotides containing m7G and a single, larger oligonucleotide containing m6A. These findings are in accord with previously sequenced structures which indicate that numerous bacterial tRNA species possess m7G while only tRNAVal contains m6A."

https://openalex.org/W1571587034,"A simple technique has been developed for isolating intracellular DNA and its bound proteins from uninfected and phage-infected bacteria. This technique, which utilizes aqueous salt concentrations in the physiological range, is based upon the fact that DNA exists in normal cell lysates in a stiff random coil conformation, and has an unusually large excluded volume to mass ratio. Such stiff coils display a unique combination of low sedimentation coefficient and large Stokes radius, enabling them to be separated rapidly from all other cellular components by successive centrifugal and gel permeation steps. Analysis of this purified intracellular DNA fraction from bacteriophage T4-infected Escherichia coli reveals mainly DNA and protein, with a small amount of RNA also present. Among the major proteins obtained are the DNA-dependent RNA polymerase of the host and the products of T4 genes rIIA, rIIB, and 32 (DNA-unwinding protein). Small amounts of the proteins coded by T4 genes 43 (DNA polymerase) and 42 (dCMP hydroxymethylase) have also been identified, in addition to at least 13 other phage-coded proteins of unidentified genes. Much of the phage-coded protein in the complex, including the gene 32 protein, does not exchange readily with the same protein exogenously added in the lysate."

https://openalex.org/W1566855057,"Abstract Limited pepsin digestion of human plasma albumin at pH 3.5 and 0 degrees in the presence of octanoate caused cleavage at residue 307 of the albumin molecule to yield two fragments. Thw two fragments corresponding to the NH2- and the COOH-terminal halves of the molecule were isolated in yields of about 15%. The COOH-terminal fragment is a mixture in which about 85% of the molecules had an additional cleavage at residue 422 of the albumin molecule. The COOH-terminal fragment with the additional cleavage at residue 422 contains two peptides which are linked by a disulfide bridge at residues 391 and 437 of the albumin molecule. Both the NH2- and the COOH-terminal fragment of human albumin showed no detectable binding of octanoate anions, that is, less than 1/170 of the binding constant of the primary site of human albumin. These findings differ from earlier observations on limited pepsin digestion of bovine plasma albumin where the corresponding COOH-terminal fragment had the octanoate-binding activity, about 1/8 of the primary binding constant of bovine albumin, while the NH2-terminal fragment did not. The COOH-terminal fragment of bovine albumin did not have cleavage at residue 422 as in the corresponding fragment of human albumin. However, it is not clear that the loss of octanoate-binding activity of fragment C of human albumin is a direct consequence of the cleavage at residue 422."

Thirteen acidic and neutral amino acids were isolated from protein hydrolysates of wild type E. coli K12 grown aerobically or anaerobically in the presence of [U-14C]glucose together with [1-3H]glucose, [3-3H]glucose, [4-3H]glucose, or [6-3H]glucose. The observed 3H/14C counts of the amino acids were compared with the ratios expected on the basis of the input substrate specific activities and present understanding of biosynthetic pathways. For nine amino acids, serine, valine, leucine, threonine, isoleucine, glycine, glutamate, proline, and phenylalanine, the agreement between anticipated and observed specific activities was satisfactory. For the remaining four, methionine, alanine, aspartate, and (in cells labeled with [3-3H]glucose) tyrosine, the anticipated and observed specific activities differed markedly. For alanine, aspartate, and tyrosine, the differences are probably due to exchange of tritium in the course of biosynthesis; for methionine, it may be that there is a principle source of the methyl group other than carbon 3 of serine."
