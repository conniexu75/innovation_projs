Defects in this process have been linked to diabetes. Diabetes-associated glucotoxicity/lipotoxicity contribute to impaired β-cell function and have been implicated as contributing factors to this disease. We tested the hypothesis that these two conditions affect β-cell function by modulating autophagy. We report that exposure of β-cell lines and human pancreatic islets to high levels of glucose and lipids blocks autophagic flux and leads to apoptotic cell death. EM analysis showed accumulation of autophagy intermediates (autophagosomes), with abundant engulfed cargo in palmitic acid (PA)- or glucose-treated cells, indicating suppressed autophagic turnover. EM studies also showed accumulation of damaged mitochondria, endoplasmic reticulum distention, and vacuolar changes in PA-treated cells. Pulse-chase experiments indicated decreased protein turnover in β-cells treated with PA/glucose. Expression of mTORC1, an inhibitor of autophagy, was elevated in β-cells treated with PA/glucose. mTORC1 inhibition, by treatment with rapamycin, reversed changes in autophagic flux, and cell death induced by glucose/PA. Our results indicate that nutrient toxicity-induced cell death occurs via impaired autophagy and is mediated by activation of mTORC1 in β-cells, contributing to β-cell failure in the presence of metabolic stress."

The present study investigated the neuroprotective effects and anti-inflammatory actions of berberine, an isoquinoline alkaloid, in both in vitro and in vivo TBI models. Mice subjected to controlled cortical impact injury were injected with berberine (10 mg·kg−1) or vehicle 10 min after injury. In addition to behavioral studies and histology analysis, blood-brain barrier (BBB) permeability and brain water content were determined. Expression of PI3K/Akt and Erk signaling and inflammatory mediators were also analyzed. The protective effect of berberine was also investigated in cultured neurons either subjected to stretch injury or exposed to conditioned media with activated microglia. Berberine significantly attenuated functional deficits and brain damage associated with TBI up to day 28 post-injury. Berberine also reduced neuronal death, apoptosis, BBB permeability, and brain edema at day 1 post-injury. These changes coincided with a marked reduction in leukocyte infiltration, microglial activation, matrix metalloproteinase-9 activity, and expression of inflammatory mediators. Berberine had no effect on Akt or Erk 1/2 phosphorylation. In mixed glial cultures, berberine reduced TLR4/MyD88/NF-κB signaling. Berberine also attenuated neuronal death induced by microglial conditioned media; however, it did not directly protect cultured neurons subjected to stretch injury. Moreover, administration of berberine at 3 h post-injury also reduced TBI-induced neuronal damage, apoptosis and inflammation in vivo. Berberine reduces TBI-induced brain damage by limiting the production of inflammatory mediators by glial cells, rather than by a direct neuroprotective effect."

The mitochondrial Ca2+ uniporter (MCU) mediates Ca2+ uptake into the organelle, where energy metabolism is further stimulated for sustained second phase insulin secretion. Here, we have studied the contribution of the MCU to the regulation of oxidative phosphorylation and metabolism-secretion coupling in intact and permeabilized clonal β-cells as well as rat pancreatic islets. Knockdown of MCU with siRNA transfection blunted matrix Ca2+ rises, decreased nutrient-stimulated ATP production as well as insulin secretion. Furthermore, MCU knockdown lowered the expression of respiratory chain complexes, mitochondrial metabolic activity, and oxygen consumption. The pH gradient formed across the inner mitochondrial membrane following nutrient stimulation was markedly lowered in MCU-silenced cells. In contrast, nutrient-induced hyperpolarization of the electrical gradient was not altered. In permeabilized cells, knockdown of MCU ablated matrix acidification in response to extramitochondrial Ca2+. Suppression of the putative Ca2+/H+ antiporter leucine zipper-EF hand-containing transmembrane protein 1 (LETM1) also abolished Ca2+-induced matrix acidification. These results demonstrate that MCU-mediated Ca2+ uptake is essential to establish a nutrient-induced mitochondrial pH gradient which is critical for sustained ATP synthesis and metabolism-secretion coupling in insulin-releasing cells.

These results demonstrate that MCU-mediated Ca2+ uptake is essential to establish a nutrient-induced mitochondrial pH gradient which is critical for sustained ATP synthesis and metabolism-secretion coupling in insulin-releasing cells. Pancreatic β-cells maintain blood glucose homeostasis by adapting insulin secretion to the changes in circulating nutrients. A major signaling molecule in this metabolism-secretion coupling linking nutrient metabolism to insulin secretion is cytosolic ATP most of which is synthesized from oxidative phosphorylation. Mitochondrial ATP synthesis is driven by the electrical (ΔΨmito, membrane potential) and chemical (ΔpHmito) gradients across the mitochondrial inner membrane. These gradients are established as a result of electron transport and the associated export of protons mediated by the respiratory chain. Reducing equivalents in mitochondrial matrix are mainly produced by the tricarboxylic acid (TCA) 2The abbreviations used are: TCAtricarboxylic acidGSISglucose-stimulated insulin secretionLETMleucine zipper-EF hand-containing transmembrane proteinMCUmitochondrial Ca2+ uniporterMTT3-(4,5-dimethylhioazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromideCOXcytochrome c oxidaseOCRoxygen consumption rate. cycle and mitochondrial metabolite shuttles.

Given its importance, mitochondrial Ca2+ uptake has been a research focus for decades, starting with the functional characterization in isolated mitochondria. Nevertheless, it took 50 years to elucidate the molecular identity of the mitochondrial Ca2+ uniporter (MCU) (11.Baughman J.M. Perocchi F. Girgis H.S. Plovanich M. Belcher-Timme C.A. Sancak Y.

Especially MICU1/2 negatively regulate MCU activity under resting cytosolic Ca2+ ([Ca2+]i).

Mitochondrial Ca2+ homeostasis is maintained by balanced Ca2+ influx and efflux. Mitochondrial Ca2+ export is mediated by antiporters exchanging Ca2+ for H+ or Na+ (20.Nicholls D.G. Crompton M. Mitochondrial calcium transport.FEBS Lett. 1980; 111: 261-268Crossref PubMed Scopus (205) Google Scholar). Two mitochondrial antiporters promoting Ca2+ efflux have been identified: The leucine zipper-EF hand-containing transmembrane protein 1 (LETM1) and the mitochondrial sodium calcium exchanger (NCLX). LETM1, which is defective in Wolf-Hirschhorn syndrome (WHS), works as a K+/H+ exchanger in yeast mitochondria (21.Froschauer E. Nowikovsky K. Schweyen R.J. Electroneutral K+/H+ exchange in mitochondrial membrane vesicles involves Yol027/Letm1 proteins.Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2005; 1711: 41-48Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar) or mammalian ER (22.Kuum M. Veksler V. Liiv J. Ventura-Clapier R. Kaasik A.

Zhao L. Clapham D.E. Genome-wide RNAi screen identifies Letm1 as a mitochondrial Ca2+/H+ antiporter.Science. 2009; 326: 144-147Crossref PubMed Scopus (398) Google Scholar). NCLX was confirmed as an electrogenic Na+/Ca2+ antiporter (exchanging 3 or 4 Na+ per Ca2+) (24.Palty R. Silverman W.F. Hershfinkel M. Caporale T. Sensi S.L. Parnis J. Nolte C. Fishman D.

In addition to [Ca2+]mito, the matrix pH has been identified as a regulator of mitochondrial energy metabolism in β-cells. In contrast to other cell types, pancreatic β-cells have acidic pHmito under resting conditions. Nutrient stimulation causes matrix alkalinization without any marked cytosolic pH change (29.Wiederkehr A. Park K.S. Dupont O. Demaurex N. Pozzan T. Cline G.W. Wollheim C.B.

Therefore, pathogenic conditions causing a reduction of ΔpHmito may seriously deteriorate ATP generation and insulin secretion in pancreatic β-cells. Several recent reports demonstrate the functional role of MCU in pancreatic β-cells (26.Tarasov A.I. Semplici F. Ravier M.A. Bellomo E.A. Pullen T.J. Gilon P. Sekler I. Rizzuto R. Rutter G.A.

Mice lacking MCU show a significant reduction of [Ca2+]mito and Ca2+-stimulated oxygen consumption in muscle mitochondria, without changes in the basal respiration in embryonic fibroblasts (33.Pan X. Liu J. Nguyen T. Liu C. Sun J. Teng Y. Fergusson M.M. Rovira II Allen M. Springer D.A. Aponte A.M. Gucek M. Balaban R.S. Murphy E. Finkel T. The physiological role of mitochondrial calcium revealed by mice lacking the mitochondrial calcium uniporter.Nat. Cell Biol. 2013; 15: 1464-1472Crossref PubMed Scopus (465) Google Scholar). It remains unclear, however, how reduced MCU activity attenuates mitochondrial signal generation in pancreatic β-cell metabolism-secretion coupling. In this study, we observed that reduced mitochondrial Ca2+ uptake following silencing of MCU significantly attenuated respiratory chain activity and ΔpHmito increase in permeabilized as well as in intact insulin-secreting cells. These defects lead to impaired ATP synthesis and insulin secretion, demonstrating the crucial role of mitochondrial Ca2+ uptake for the establishment of the ΔpHmito in metabolism-secretion coupling. We also provide evidence for a novel role of the putative Ca2+/H+ antiporter leucine zipper-EF hand-containing transmembrane protein 1 (LETM1) as a Ca2+ efflux route in insulin secreting cells, the role of which is altered in the absence of MCU. Rat insulinoma INS-1E cells were cultured in a humidified atmosphere (37 °C) containing 5% CO2 in a complete medium composed of RPMI 1640 (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA) supplemented with 10% FBS (Invitrogen), 1 mm sodium pyruvate, 50 μm 2-mercaptoethanol, 2 mm glutamine, 10 mm HEPES, 100 units/ml penicillin, and 100 μg/ml streptomycin (HyClone, Thermo Fisher Scientific Inc., Lafayette, CO). Experiments were performed with cells of passage number 80–120. Most chemicals were purchased from Sigma except JC-1 from Molecular Probes (Eugene, OR). Pancreatic islets were isolated from 200–300-g male Sprague-Dawley rats (Orient Bio, Seongnam, Korea) by collagenase (Sigma) digestion (29.Wiederkehr A. Park K.S. Dupont O. Demaurex N. Pozzan T.

INS-1E cells were seeded and cultured onto well-plates or coverslips coated with 804G matrix. Cells were washed with Ca2+-free Krebs-Ringer bicarbonate (KRB) solution (mm; 140 NaCl, 3.6 KCl, 0.5 NaH2PO4, 0.5 MgSO4, 1.5 CaCl2, 10 HEPES, 2 NaHCO3, 5.5 glucose, pH 7.4 titrated with NaOH) and then incubated for 10 min at 37 °C with 1 μg/ml of Staphylococcus aureus α-hemolysin toxin (Sigma) in an intracellular buffer (mm; 140 KCl, 5 NaCl, 7 MgSO4, 1 KH2PO4, 20 HEPES, 10.2 EGTA, 1.65 CaCl2, 0.1 ATP, pH 7.0 with KOH), which has about 120 nm of free Ca2+ concentration. After α-toxin permeabilization, cells were washed once with 0.5% bovine serum albumin (BSA) containing intracellular buffer and used for experiments (29.Wiederkehr A. Park K.S. Dupont O. Demaurex N.

Cells were transfected with non-targeting or target-specific small interfering RNA (siRNA) using DharmaFECT1 (Dharmacon, Thermo Fisher Scientific Inc.). The target-specific siRNAs for rat MCU and LETM1 were purchased from Dharmacon, which is composed of siRNAs for four different targets of each gene (SMARTpool, Dharmacon). Total RNA was isolated from cells 72 h after siRNA transfection using the RNeasy kit (Cat. 74134, Qiagen GmbH, Hilden, Germany). First strand cDNA was synthesized from 1 μg of total RNA with a reverse transcription kit (Applied Bioscience, Foster City, CA) using oligo-dT. Quantitative PCR was performed using sequence-specific primers for rat MCU (forward: 5′-GAAGTAGGTGACCGGTTCCA-3′, reverse: 5′-AGGAAAGCGGAGAAGAGGAC-3′), and LETM1 (forward: 5′-GGCTGGACTTGCACCTGTAT-3′, reverse: 5′-CAAGGTGGACTTCAGCTGGT-3′). Rat β-actin was used as the reference control. For the analysis of each gene expression, experiments were conducted in a triplicate in the real-time PCR system (7900HT, Applied Bioscience) using SYBR Green PCR Master Mix (Cat. 204143, Qiagen GmbH). Data were analyzed following ΔΔCT method (34.Livak K.J. Schmittgen T.D.

The protein level of MCU or LETM1 was determined in a cell extract using Western blotting as described previously (31.Quan X. Das R. Xu S. Cline G.W. Wiederkehr A. Wollheim C.B. Park K.S.

Horseradish peroxidase (HRP)-conjugated secondary antibody against either mouse or rabbit IgG (Cat. 31450 and 31460, Thermo Scientific) was incubated for 1 h at room temperature. The bands were visualized with a UVP Biospectrum-600 imaging system using enhanced chemiluminescence (ECL) solution (Luminata Forte, Millipore). To measure mitochondrial matrix Ca2+ level, we used a mitochondria-targeted ratio-pericam (RPmit) plasmid, generously provided by Prof. Roger Tsien (UC San Diego). Cells were transfected with siRNA, and 24 h after, transfected with RPmit using X-tremeGENE (Roche Diagnostics GmbH, Mannheim, Germany). Fluorescence imaging of Ca2+ was performed by using an inverted microscope (IX-81, Olympus, Tokyo, Japan) with an array laser confocal spinning disk (CSU10, Yokogawa Electric Corporation, Tokyo, Japan) and a cooled charge-coupled device (CCD) camera (Cascade 512B, Photometrics, Tucson, AZ). Intact or permeabilized cells on the confocal microscope were perfused with KRB solution or intracellular buffer, respectively, and fluorescence images (435 nm excitation and 535 nm emission) were acquired every 10 s and analyzed using Metafluor 6.3 software (Universal Imaging, Molecular Devices). Cells plated onto 48 well-plates (2 × 105 cells/well) were permeabilized with α-toxin and incubated for 5 or 15 min in an intracellular buffer containing ADP (10 μm) with or without succinate (3 mm). To determine mitochondrial ATP release, the supernatant was harvested after incubation, and ATP level was measured by using the microplate reader (SynergyTM2, BioTek Instruments Inc., Winooski, VT) with a bioluminescence assay kit (HS II, Roche Diagnostics, Mannheim, Germany). For static insulin secretion measurement, cells in a 804G-coated 24 well-plate (1.5 × 105 cells/well) were transfected with siRNA and grown for 72 h. After deprivation of glucose for 1 h, cells were preincubated for 30 min with a KRB solution containing 2.8 mm glucose and 0.1% BSA. Then, cells were washed and incubated for 30 min with 2.8 mm or 16.7 mm glucose-containing KRB solution. Supernatant was collected for estimation of insulin release. Cellular insulin contents were determined in acid-ethanol extracts. Insulin levels were measured by using an insulin ELISA kit (Shibayagi Co., Gunma, Japan). For cytochrome c oxidase (COX) activity measurement, INS-1E cells were permeabilized by freeze-thaw cycle three times and mixed with isotonic solution (10 mm KH2PO4, 250 mm sucrose, 0.1% BSA, pH 6.5) with detergent (laurylmaltoside, 2.5 mm). Traces were started with the addition of reduced cytochrome c (25 nm; with a tiny amount of sodium hydrosulfite) and the enzymatic activity of COX was estimated by measuring absorbance at 550 nm continuously with a spectrophotometer (Amersham Biosciences, GE Healthcare Biosciences, Pittsburgh, PA). COX activity was expressed as moles of oxidized cytochrome c per min. Citrate synthase activity was measured with citrate synthase assay kit (Sigma) based on the manufacturer's instructions. For the MTT assay, siRNA-transfected cells were incubated with 3-(4,5-dimethylhioazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide (MTT) (50 μg/well) for 2 h and then treated with dimethyl sulfoxide (100 μl/well). The absorbance (A570 − A630) of each well was measured by using a microplate reader (Molecular Devices, Sunnyvale, CA). Cellular oxygen consumption rate (OCR) was determined by Extracellular Flux Analyzer (XF-24, Seahorse Bioscience, North Billerica, MA). Cells (2 × 104 cells/well) seeded on 24-well plates (Seahorse Bioscience) were transfected with siRNA and cultured for 72 h. On the experiment day, cells were incubated for 1 h at 37 °C with KRB solution containing 2.8 mm glucose prior to 20 min of basal OCR measurement. Then, glucose (16.7 mm), oligomycin (3 μg/ml), FCCP (3 μm), and antimycin A (3 μm) were added consecutively and the changes in OCR analyzed. Mitochondrial matrix pH (pHmito) was measured using adenovirus expressing mtAlpHi (Ad-tetON-mAlpHi) as described previously (29.Wiederkehr A. Park K.S. Dupont O. Demaurex N. Pozzan T. Cline G.W. Wollheim C.B. Matrix alkalinization: a novel mitochondrial signal for sustained pancreatic beta-cell activation.EMBO J. 2009; 28: 417-428Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). Intact or permeabilized cells on the confocal microscope were perfused with KRB solution (pH 7.4) or intracellular buffer (pH 7.0), respectively, and the fluorescence signals (488 nm excitation and 535 nm emission) were recorded. Titration of the mitochondrial pH was performed by clamping the matrix pH with high K+ buffer (mm) (125 KCl, 5 NaCl, 1 NaH2PO4, 1 MgSO4, 10 HEPES) of defined pH containing the ionophores nigericin (5 μm) and monensin (5 μm) (31.Quan X.

To measure the mitochondrial membrane potential (ΔΨmito), cells seeded onto black-walled 96-well plates (5 × 104 cells/well) were loaded with JC-1 (500 nm, Invitrogen) for 30 min and then permeabilized with α-toxin. The ratio of red (540 nm excitation and 590 nm emission) over green (490 nm excitation and 540 nm emission) fluorescence intensity was monitored from permeabilized cells in the presence of intracellular buffer containing JC-1 (500 nm) using a multi-well fluorescence reader (FlexStation, Molecular Devices) (35.Park K.S.

https://openalex.org/W1985081669,"RT-qPCR is the accepted technique for the quantification of microRNA (miR) expression: however, stem-loop RT-PCR, the most frequently used method for quantification of miRs, is time- and reagent-consuming as well as inconvenient for scanning. We established a new method called ‘universal stem-loop primer’ (USLP) with 8 random nucleotides instead of a specific sequence at the 3′ end of the traditional stem-loop primer (TSLP), for screening miR profile and to semi-quantify expression of miRs. Peripheral blood samples were cultured with phytohaemagglutinin (PHA), and then 87 candidate miRs were scanned in cultured T cells. By USLP, our study revealed that the expression of miR-150-5p (miR-150) decreased nearly 10-fold, and miR-155-5p (miR-155) increased more than 7-fold after treated with PHA. The results of the dissociation curve and gel electrophoresis showed that the PCR production of the USLP and TSLP were specificity. The USLP method has high precision because of its low ICV (ICV<2.5%). The sensitivity of the USLP is up to 103 copies/µl miR. As compared with the TSLP, USLP saved 75% the cost of primers and 60% of the test time. The USLP method is a simple, rapid, precise, sensitive, and cost-effective approach that is suitable for screening miR profiles."
https://openalex.org/W1973859913,"We recently described the mitochondrial localization and import of the vitamin D receptor (VDR) in actively proliferating HaCaT cells for the first time, but its role in the organelle remains unknown. Many metabolic intermediates that support cell growth are provided by the mitochondria; consequently, the identification of proteins that regulate mitochondrial metabolic pathways is of great interest, and we sought to understand whether VDR may modulate these pathways. We genetically silenced VDR in HaCaT cells and studied the effects on cell growth, mitochondrial metabolism and biosynthetic pathways. VDR knockdown resulted in robust growth inhibition, with accumulation in the G0G1 phase of the cell cycle and decreased accumulation in the M phase. The effects of VDR silencing on proliferation were confirmed in several human cancer cell lines. Decreased VDR expression was consistently observed in two different models of cell differentiation. The impairment of silenced HaCaT cell growth was accompanied by sharp increases in the mitochondrial membrane potential, which sensitized the cells to oxidative stress. We found that transcription of the subunits II and IV of cytochrome c oxidase was significantly increased upon VDR silencing. Accordingly, treatment of HaCaT cells with vitamin D downregulated both subunits, suggesting that VDR may inhibit the respiratory chain and redirect TCA intermediates toward biosynthesis, thus contributing to the metabolic switch that is typical of cancer cells. In order to explore this hypothesis, we examined various acetyl-CoA-dependent biosynthetic pathways, such as the mevalonate pathway (measured as cholesterol biosynthesis and prenylation of small GTPases), and histone acetylation levels; all of these pathways were inhibited by VDR silencing. These data provide evidence of the role of VDR as a gatekeeper of mitochondrial respiratory chain activity and a facilitator of the diversion of acetyl-CoA from the energy-producing TCA cycle toward biosynthetic pathways that are essential for cellular proliferation."

This study aimed to make overall evaluation of the association between these two anesthetic techniques and prognosis of cancer patients undergoing surgery.Related databases such as PubMed and EMbase were searched for eligible studies that evaluated the influence of EGA and GA on the prognosis of cancer patients undergoing surgery. Selected studies were evaluated according to the inclusion criteria by two reviewers respectively, followed by data extraction and quality assessment. The odds ratio (OR) with their 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were calculated to assess the influence strength of EGA and GA on prognosis of cancer patients.A total of ten studies involving 3254 patients were included. The overall results demonstrated that there was no significant difference between EGA and GA group (OR = 0.88, 95% CI 0.73 to 1.06, P = 0.187) concerning postoperative recurrence and metastasis rate. In regard to the following two factors: cancer category and time of follow-up, subgroup analysis identified significant differences between EGA and GA in the group of patients with prostate cancer and the group with follow-up less than or equal to two years (OR = 0.66, 95% CI 0.46 to 0.95, P = 0.027; OR = 0.70, 95% CI 0.51 to 0.98, P = 0.035; respectively) concerning postoperative recurrence and metastasis rate. However, no significant difference was found in the group of patients with colorectal cancer (OR = 1.06, 95% CI 0.84-1.33, P = 0.62).This meta-analysis showed that EGA might be associated with improvement in prognosis of patients with operable prostate cancer and the cancer patients with follow-up less than or equal to two years. However, no obvious relationship between the improvement in prognosis of colorectal cancer and EGA were detected, comparing to GA. Furthermore, all the results should be interpreted cautiously, as heterogeneous data were used for analyzing."
https://openalex.org/W2086190149,"Supplemental oxygen inhalation is frequently used to treat severe respiratory failure; however, prolonged exposure to hyperoxia causes hyperoxic acute lung injury (HALI), which induces acute respiratory distress syndrome and leads to high mortality rates. Recent investigations suggest the possible role of NLRP3 inflammasomes, which regulate IL-1β production and lead to inflammatory responses, in the pathophysiology of HALI; however, their role is not fully understood. In this study, we investigated the role of NLRP3 inflammasomes in mice with HALI. Under hyperoxic conditions, NLRP3−/− mice died at a higher rate compared with wild-type and IL-1β−/− mice, and there was no difference in IL-1β production in their lungs. Under hyperoxic conditions, the lungs of NLRP3−/− mice exhibited reduced inflammatory responses, such as inflammatory cell infiltration and cytokine expression, as well as increased and decreased expression of MMP-9 and Bcl-2, respectively. NLRP3−/− mice exhibited diminished expression and activation of Stat3, which regulates MMP-9 and Bcl-2, in addition to increased numbers of apoptotic alveolar epithelial cells. In vitro experiments revealed that alveolar macrophages and neutrophils promoted Stat3 activation in alveolar epithelial cells. Furthermore, NLRP3 deficiency impaired the migration of neutrophils and chemokine expression by macrophages. These findings demonstrate that NLRP3 regulates Stat3 signaling in alveolar epithelial cells by affecting macrophage and neutrophil function independent of IL-1β production and contributes to the pathophysiology of HALI.

Increasing evidence indicates that inflammation in the absence of pathogens, referred to as sterile inflammation, is mediated through NLRP3 (nucleotide-binding oligomerization domain-like receptor family pyrin domain containing 3; also known as NALP3 and cryopyrin) inflammasomes, which are large cytosolic multiple-protein complexes that regulate the production of the proinflammatory cytokine IL-1β (5.Latz E.

NLRP3 inflammasomes contain NLRP3 associated with ASC (apoptosis-associated speck-like protein containing a caspase recruitment domain), which recruits caspase-1 and induces its activation. Caspase-1 is an IL-1β-converting enzyme that processes pro-IL-1β to its mature form and induces IL-1β release, causing inflammatory responses and tissue damage. We recently demonstrated the importance of NLRP3 inflammasomes in the pathogenesis of certain diseases, such as myocardial ischemia-reperfusion, atherosclerosis, vascular injury, and chronic kidney diseases (7.Usui F.

However, the precise role of NLRP3 inflammasomes in HALI remains unknown. In this study, we used mice deficient in NLRP3 and IL-1β and unexpectedly found that a deficiency in NLRP3 (but not IL-1β) shortened survival under hyperoxic conditions regardless of diminished inflammatory responses. Furthermore, we observed that Stat3 (signal transducer and activator of transcription 3) signaling caused hyperoxia-induced lethality in NLRP3−/− mice. These findings demonstrate a novel role for NLRP3 in the pathophysiology of HALI independent of IL-1β and provide novel insights into the mechanisms of pathogenesis of HALI.

The mice were exposed to 90% oxygen (7 liters/min) in an airtight plastic chamber (40 × 35 × 30 cm) at 24–25 °C. In our preliminary experiments, we analyzed the total cell counts, neutrophils, and macrophages in bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF) isolated from WT mice at 24, 48, 72, and 96 h after hyperoxia and observed a significant increase in these cells after 72 h. Therefore, we analyzed the samples at 72 h after hyperoxia. The mice had ad libitum access to food and water and were subjected to a 12-h light/dark cycle. The mice were observed every 12 h. All experiments in this study were performed in accordance with the Jichi Medical University Guide for Laboratory Animals. BALF was obtained by cannulating the trachea with an 18-gauge catheter. After the whole lung was lavaged four times with 0.8 ml of PBS, the lavage fluid was centrifuged at 1000 rpm for 10 min at 4 °C, and cell-free supernatants were stored at −30 °C. The pellet was diluted in PBS, the cells were stained with trypan blue, and the number of cells was counted using a hemocytometer. Differential cell analysis was performed by Diff-Quik staining (Sysmex, Kobe, Japan) after cytospinning (800 rpm, 8 min, 22 °C) and by flow cytometry. RNA was extracted using ISOGEN (Nippon Gene Co., Ltd., Toyama, Japan) from lungs perfused with PBS according to the manufacturer's instructions. Real-time RT-PCR analysis was performed using a Takara TP960 PCR Thermal Cycler Dice detection system (Takara Bio Inc., Shiga, Japan) to detect mRNA.

Expression levels were quantified using a standard curve and were normalized to the content of 18 S rRNA. Each normalized value was expressed as a ratio to the value of WT mice exposed to normoxia. Lysates from perfused lung tissue and cell culture were prepared using radioimmune precipitation assay buffer (20 mm Tris, 2.5 mm EDTA, 1% Triton X, 10% glycerol, 1% deoxycholic acid, 0.1% SDS, 50 mm NaF, and 10 mm Na4P2O7·10H2O) and subjected to SDS-PAGE. The proteins were electrophoretically transferred to PVDF membranes. The membranes were blocked with 2% casein or 3% BSA for 1 h at room temperature and then incubated overnight at 4 °C with primary antibodies, followed by incubation for 1 h with secondary antibodies conjugated to HRP. Immunoreactive bands were visualized using a Western BLoT chemiluminescent HRP substrate system (Takara Bio Inc.). The expression level of β-actin served as an internal control for protein loading. Primary antibodies against Stat3, phospho-Stat3 (Tyr-705), Bax, and Bcl-2 (Cell Signaling Technology, Inc., Boston, MA); NLRP3 (R&D Systems); and anti-β-actin (Sigma-Aldrich) were used. HRP-conjugated goat anti-mouse IgG (Invitrogen) and HRP-conjugated goat anti-rabbit IgG (ZyMAX grade, Zymed Laboratories Inc., South San Francisco, CA) were used as secondary antibodies. The results represent at least three independent experiments. Quantitative analysis of bands was performed using ImageJ 1.47v (National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, MD). MMP-9 (matrix metalloproteinase 9) levels were measured using a mouse MMP-9 activity assay kit (QuickZyme Biosciences, Leiden, The Netherlands) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Lungs were fixed by intratracheal injection of 1 ml of 10% formalin and embedded in paraffin. Lung tissue sections (5-μm thick) were stained with H&E. Neutrophils were stained using a naphthol AS-D chloroacetate esterase staining kit (Muto Pure Chemicals Co., Ltd., Tokyo, Japan), which identifies specific leukocyte esterases. The cells in 10 random fields were counted at a magnification of ×60. Immunohistochemical analyses were performed to detect the oxidative stress marker 4-hydroxy-2-nonenal (4-HNE) and the white blood cell marker CD45. In brief, deparaffinized sections were boiled in target retrieval solution (Dako, Carpinteria, CA), blocked with normal goat serum, and incubated overnight with an antibody against CD45 (BD Biosciences). This was followed by incubation with Histofine Simple Stain Rat MAX PO (Nichirei Biosciences Inc., Tokyo, Japan). The immune complexes were detected using a 3,3′-diaminobenzidine substrate kit (Vector Labs, Burlingame, CA). For 4-HNE immunostaining, the sections were blocked with mouse IgG-blocking reagent (M.O.M. immunodetection kit, Vector Labs) and incubated overnight with an antibody against 4-HNE (clone HNEJ-2, Japan Institute for the Control of Aging, Nikken SEIL Co., Shizuoka, Japan). This was followed by incubation with biotin-conjugated secondary antibodies. The sections were treated with avidin-peroxidase (VECTASTAIN ABC kit, Vector Labs). The reaction was developed using the 3,3′-diaminobenzidine substrate kit. The sections were counterstained with hematoxylin. No signals were detected when an irrelevant IgG (Vector Labs) was used instead of the primary antibody as a negative control. The images of the stained sections were digitized and analyzed using an FSX100 microscope (Olympus, Tokyo, Japan). Five-hundred cells were randomly selected to calculate the percentage of positive cells. Apoptotic cells were identified with an in situ apoptosis detection kit (Takara Bio Inc.) using the TUNEL method and immunohistochemical staining of cleaved caspase-3. In brief, deparaffinized sections were boiled in 1 mm EDTA for 10 min in a pressure cooker. For TUNEL staining, boiled sections were blocked with 3% H2O2 and incubated at 37 °C for 90 min with terminal deoxynucleotidyltransferase enzyme. For immunohistochemical staining of cleaved caspase-3, boiled sections were blocked with 1% H2O2 and normal goat serum and incubated overnight with an antibody against cleaved caspase-3 (Cell Signaling Technology, Inc.). This was followed by incubation with Histofine Simple Stain Rabbit MAX PO (Nichirei Biosciences Inc.). The immune complexes were detected using the 3,3′-diaminobenzidine substrate kit, and the sections were counterstained with hematoxylin. The images of the stained sections were digitized and analyzed using a microscope. Five-hundred alveolar epithelial cells were randomly selected to calculate the percentage of positive cells. The extracted left lung was weighed to obtain the wet weight and kept in an oven at 75 °C for 72 h to obtain the dry weight. The protein concentration in BALF was measured using BCA protein assay reagent (Thermo Fisher Scientific Inc., Waltham, MA). IL-1β levels in BALF were assessed using a mouse ELISA kit (R&D Systems) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Cells collected from BALF were analyzed by flow cytometry. The cells were double-labeled with the following antibodies: allophycocyanin-conjugated anti-CD45 (eBioscience), FITC-conjugated anti-CD45R (eBioscience), phycoerythrin-conjugated anti-Ly6G (BD Biosciences), FITC-conjugated anti-CD11c (BD Biosciences), and phycoerythrin-conjugated anti-CD11b (eBioscience). The cells were analyzed using a FACSCalibur system with CellQuest version 3.3 (BD Biosciences). Isotype control antibodies were used as negative controls to exclude nonspecific staining. MLE 12 (murine lung epithelial cells) and MH-S (murine alveolar macrophages) cell lines were purchased from American Type Culture Collection (Manassas, VA). MLE 12 cells were grown in DMEM and 1000 mg/liter glucose (Wako Pure Chemical Industries, Ltd., Osaka, Japan) containing 10% FBS. MH-S cells were grown in RPMI 1640 medium (Sigma-Aldrich) containing 10% FBS and 0.05 mm 2-mercaptoethanol (Sigma-Aldrich). Immortalized murine bone marrow-derived macrophages (BMDMs) from WT and NLRP3 mice (provided by E. L.) (17.Hornung V. Bauernfeind F. Halle A. Samstad E.O. Kono H. Rock K.L. Fitzgerald K.A. Latz E. Silica crystals and aluminum salts activate the NALP3 inflammasome through phagosomal destabilization.Nat.

Primary alveolar epithelial cells and macrophages were isolated from murine lungs as described previously (18.Dobbs L.G. Gonzalez R.F.

In brief, alveolar macrophages in the alveolar cavities were removed by lavaging whole lungs with PBS administered through intratracheal cannulation. After perfusion with PBS, the lungs were extracted and digested with collagenase type I (Wako Pure Chemical Industries, Ltd.) and Dispase (Dispase II, Godo Shusei Co., Ltd., Tokyo, Japan) with DNase (Worthington). To isolate alveolar epithelial cells, the cells were placed on culture dishes for 30 min to allow the alveolar macrophages to adhere securely to the bottom of the culture dishes. Non-adherent cells (alveolar epithelial cells) were removed and added to new culture dishes. The expression of type I collagen and surfactant protein C was determined in the alveolar epithelial cells. Adherent cells (alveolar macrophages) were mixed with alveolar macrophages collected from alveolar cavities. Peritoneal exudate neutrophils were isolated by intraperitoneal injection of 9% casein as described previously (20.Inoue Y. Shirasuna K. Kimura H. Usui F. Kawashima A. Karasawa T. Tago K. Dezaki K.

Hyperoxia was maintained in an incubator with an atmosphere of 90% O2 and 5% CO2. Neutrophil migration was analyzed using a Transwell migration assay with 24-well tissue culture plates (3-μm pore polycarbonate membranes, BD Biosciences) (20.Inoue Y. Shirasuna K. Kimura H. Usui F.

After the supernatant from MLE 12 cells or recombinant murine CXCL1 (also known as KC; PeproTech, Inc., Rocky Hill, NJ) was added to the lower chamber, neutrophils (2 × 105) were placed in the upper chamber and incubated for 1 h at 37 °C. Neutrophils in the lower chamber were collected and analyzed by flow cytometry. Separated co-culture of MLE 12 cells with MH-S cells or neutrophils was performed using 6-well tissue culture plates with a Transwell culture system (0.4-μm pore polycarbonate membranes, BD Biosciences). After MLE 12 cells (1 × 106 cells) were cultured in the lower chamber for 24 h, MH-S cells (5 × 105 to 1 × 106 cells) or neutrophils (5 × 105 to 2 × 106 cells) were added to the upper chamber and incubated for 8 h, and cell lysates from the MLE 12 cells in the lower chamber were prepared. Non-separated co-culture was performed using 6-well tissue culture plates. Neutrophils were prepared from WT or NLRP3−/− mice as described above. NLRP3−/− mice were reconstituted with 1 × 106 WT or NLRP3−/− neutrophils by intravenous administration 5 h before exposure to hyperoxia. Data were analyzed using SPSS version 21 (IBM Japan Ltd., Tokyo, Japan) and expressed as the means ± S.E. An unpaired t test was used to compare two groups. For comparisons between multiple groups, the significance of differences between group means was determined by one-way analysis of variance combined with Tukey's test or the Games-Howell test. We defined p < 0.05 as statistically significant. We first examined the survival times of WT, NLRP3−/−, and IL-1β−/− mice exposed to hyperoxia (90% O2), which is an established model of acute lung injury, and found that NLRP3−/− mice survived for significantly shorter times compared with WT mice (median survival time of 96 ± 6.53 h versus 120 ± 2.28 h, p < 0.01) (Fig. 1A). There was no significant difference in survival time between WT and IL-1β−/− mice (median survival time of 120 ± 0.00 h versus 108 ± 10.25 h) (Fig. 1B). In addition, there was no significant difference in IL-1β production in BALF between WT and NLRP3−/− mice under normoxic or hyperoxic conditions (Fig. 1C). Real-time RT-PCR analysis showed that although Il1b mRNA expression was significantly elevated in the lungs of hyperoxic WT mice compared with normoxic mice, there was no significant difference in elevated Il1b expression between hyperoxic WT and NLRP3−/− mice (Fig. 1D). These results indicate that NLRP3 contributes to the survival of mice exposed to lethal hyperoxia independent of IL-1β. H&E staining showed thickening of the alveolar septae, vascular congestion, and alveolar edema present to similar extents in the lungs of hyperoxic WT and NLRP3−/− mice (Fig. 2A). Because hyperoxia generates excess amounts of reactive oxygen species in the lungs (2.Kallet R.H. Matthay M.A. Hyperoxic acute lung injury.Respir Care. 2013; 58: 123-141Crossref PubMed Scopus (223) Google Scholar), we performed immunohistochemical analysis of 4-HNE, a marker of lipid peroxidation. Compared with normoxia, hyperoxia markedly increased the number of 4-HNE-positive cells in the lungs (Fig. 2, B and C); however, there was no significant difference between WT and NLRP3−/− mice with respect to the number of 4-HNE-positive cells. To assess the infiltration of inflammatory cells into the lungs, we performed immunohistochemical analysis of CD45 and found that infiltration of inflammatory cells was significantly increased in the lungs of hyperoxic WT mice and that this increased infiltration was significantly suppressed in NLRP3−/− mice (Fig. 3, A and B). We determined the number and type of inflammatory cells in BALF. Consistent with the results of immunohistochemical analysis, the cell number was significantly increased by hyperoxia in the BALF of WT mice, and this increase was markedly suppressed in NLRP3−/− mice (Fig. 3C). Flow cytometric analysis revealed that the number of alveolar macrophages (CD11c+) and neutrophils (Ly6G+/CD45R−) in BALF was significantly increased in hyperoxic WT mice and significantly decreased in hyperoxic NLRP3−/− mice (Fig. 3D). Prevention of neutrophil infiltration of the lungs of hyperoxic NLRP3−/− mice was confirmed by naphthol AS-D chloroacetate esterase staining (data not shown). To investigate whether inflammatory cytokines are involved in hyperoxia-induced lethality, we determined the levels of Ccl2, Cxcl1, Il6, and Lif in the lungs of normoxic and hyperoxic mice. Real-time RT-PCR analysis revealed that the expression of Ccl2, Cxcl1, Il6, and Lif was significantly elevated in hyperoxic WT mice compared with normoxic WT mice and that this increase was significantly suppressed in hyperoxic NLRP3−/− mice (Fig. 4). Because inflammatory responses were suppressed in the lungs of NLRP3−/− mice, we investigated whether another mechanism may explain the findings regarding hyperoxia-induced lethality. Previous studies indicate that MMP-9 and apoptosis may play a crucial role in HALI and lethality (21.Lian X. Qin Y. Hossain S.A. Yang L. White A. Xu H. Shipley J.M. Li T. Senior R.M. Du H. Yan C. Overexpression of Stat3C in pulmonary epithelium protects against hyperoxic lung injury.J. Immunol. 2005; 174: 7250-7256Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). Real-time RT-PCR analysis revealed that the expression of Mmp9 mRNA was markedly increased in the lungs of hyperoxic NLRP3−/− mice compared with hyperoxic WT mice (Fig. 5A). There was a consistent increase in MMP-9 protein levels in the lungs of NLRP3−/− mice compared with WT mice (Fig. 5B). Furthermore, the mRNA expression level of the anti-apoptotic molecule Bcl2 in the lungs of hyperoxic NLRP3−/− mice was lower than that in the lungs of hyperoxic WT mice (Fig. 5C). The ratio of Bax to Bcl2, a key factor in the regulation of apoptosis, was significantly increased in the lungs of hyperoxic NLRP3−/− mice. Moreover, the results of Western bot analysis showed that the protein ratio of Bax to Bcl-2 was significantly increased in the lungs of NLRP3−/− mice (Fig. 5, D and E). Because the expression of Bcl-2 was decreased and the ratio of Bax to Bcl-2 was increased in the lungs of hyperoxic NLRP3−/− mice, we ascertained apoptosis of alveolar epithelial cells by TUNEL staining and immunohistochemical staining of cleaved caspase-3. Both TUNEL-positive cells and cleaved caspase-3-positive cells were significantly increased in alveolar epithelial cells of hyperoxic NLRP3−/− mice (Fig. 6). These results suggest that progression of apoptosis contributes to hyperoxia-induced lethality in NLRP3−/− mice. We next focused on Stat3 because it regulates the transcription of MMP-9 and Bcl-2 (21.Lian X. Qin Y. Hossain S.A. Yang L. White A. Xu H. Shipley J.M. Li T. Senior R.M. Du H. Yan C.

https://openalex.org/W1992063298,"Ubiquitin signaling on chromatin is linked to diverse aspects of genome regulation, including gene expression and DNA repair. The yeast RING E3 ligase Bre1 combines with the E2 Rad6 to monoubiquitinate histone H2B during transcription. Little is known about how Bre1 directs Rad6 toward transferring only a single ubiquitin to a specific lysine residue. Using a defined in vitro system, we show that the Bre1 RING domain interaction with Rad6 is minimally sufficient to monoubiquitinate nucleosomes at histone H2B Lys-123. In addition, we reveal a cluster of charged residues on the Bre1 RING domain that is critical for recognizing the nucleosome surface. Notably, a second Rad6 binding domain of Bre1 interacts with the E2 backside and potentiates ubiquitin transfer to the substrate. Taken together, our study establishes a molecular framework for how distinct RING and non-RING E3 elements cooperate to regulate E2 reactivity and substrate selection during gene expression."
https://openalex.org/W1972491378,"Objectives One way to optimize the drug prescription in rheumatoid arthritis (RA) is to identify predictive biomarkers of drug responsiveness. Here, we investigated the potential ""theranostic"" value of proteins of the S100 family by monitoring levels of both S100A8 and S100A9 in blood samples from RA patients. Design For proteomic analysis, peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) and serum samples were collected in patients prior to initiation of the methotrexate/etanercept (MTX/ETA) combination. Firstly, relative mass spectrometry (MS) quantification focusing on S100A8 and S100A9 proteins was carried out from PBMCs samples to identify potential biomarkers. The same approach was also performed from serum samples from responder (R) and non responder (NR) patients. Finally, to confirm these results, an absolute quantification of S100A8, S100A9 proteins and calprotectin (heterodimer of S100A8/S100A9) was carried out on the serum samples using ELISA. Results MS analyses revealed that both S100A8 and S100A9 proteins were significantly accumulated in PBMC from responders. In contrast to PBMC, only the S100A9 protein was significantly overexpressed in the serum of R patients. Absolute quantification by ELISA confirmed this result and pointed out a similar expression level of S100A8 protein and calprotectin in sera from both R and NR groups. Thus, the S100A9 protein revealed to be predictive of MTX/ETA responsiveness, contrarily to parameters of inflammation and auto-antibodies which did not allow significant discrimination. Conclusion This is the first report of an overexpression of S100A9 protein in both PBMCs and serum of patients with subsequent response to the MTX/ETA combination. This protein thus represents an interesting biomarker candidate of therapeutic response in RA."

Among those are 30 single-residue mutations in TPM1, the gene encoding α-tropomyosin. We examined seven mutant tropomyosins, E62Q, D84N, I172T, L185R, S215L, D230N, and M281T, that were chosen based on their clinical severity and locations along the molecule. The goal of our study was to determine how the biochemical characteristics of each of these mutant proteins are altered, which in turn could provide a structural rationale for treatment of the cardiomyopathies they produce.

We also report correlations between ATPase activity at maximum Ca2+ concentrations and conformational changes in TnC measured using a fluorescent probe, which provide evidence that different substitutions perturb the structure of the regulatory complex in different ways. Moreover, we observed changes in protein stability and protein-protein interactions in these mutants. Our results suggest multiple mechanistic pathways to hypertrophic and dilated cardiomyopathies.

At the sarcomeric level, contractility is brought about by Ca2+ regulation of the cross-bridge cycle. Cross-bridges form between myosin heads protruding from bipolar thick filaments and the regulated thin filament (RTF). The RTF is composed of F-actin, Tm, and the Tn complex and responds to Ca2+ with a series of conformational changes. The most widely accepted model linking Ca2+ and muscle contraction is the three-state model (9McKillop D.F. Geeves M.A. Regulation of the interaction between actin and myosin subfragment 1: evidence for three states of the thin filament.Biophys. J. 1993; 65: 693-701Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (659) Google Scholar, 10Tobacman L.S. Butters C.A. A new model of cooperative myosin-thin filament binding.J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 27587-27593Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar). In the absence of Ca2+, Tm physically occludes the myosin-binding sites on actin to produce the blocked state. Muscle contraction is triggered by the influx of Ca2+ into the sarcoplasm, where it binds to TnC and initiates a sequence of conformational changes through TnI and TnT. The ensuing conformational shift of TnT and its interaction with Tm (11Murakami K. Stewart M. Nozawa K. Tomii K. Kudou N. Igarashi N. Shirakihara Y. Wakatsuki S. Yasunaga T. Wakabayashi T. Structural basis for tropomyosin overlap in thin (actin) filaments and the generation of a molecular swivel by troponin-T.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2008; 105: 7200-7205Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar) results in azimuthal movement of Tm and partial uncovering of the myosin-binding sites of actin. This is called the closed state. Myosin binding to F-actin stimulates the power stroke, associated with phosphate release, causing movement of thin filaments with respect to the myosin heads, and sarcomere contraction. ADP is released from the myosin head in the subsequent steps (12Murphy C.T. Rock R.S. Spudich J.A. A myosin II mutation uncouples ATPase activity from motility and shortens step size.Nat. Cell Biol. 2001; 3: 311-315Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar, 13Kraft T. Mählmann E. Mattei T. Brenner B. Initiation of the power stroke in muscle: insights from the phosphate analog AlF4.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2005; 102: 13861-13866Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar). The binding of myosin further displaces Tm, producing the open state. Dissociation of Ca2+ from TnC and the ATP-induced dissociation of myosin from actin produce sarcomere relaxation. Thus, muscle contraction is brought about by coordination between Ca2+-induced changes in the thin filament and the ATPase cycle of myosin. The components of the RTF harbor almost 100 cardiomyopathy-associated single-residue substitutions (14Tardiff J.C. Thin filament mutations: developing an integrative approach to a complex disorder.Circ. Res. 2011; 108: 765-782Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar), making the RTF a crucial system to study. In this study we focus on Tm, because its interactions with actin, Tn, and myosin define the states of the RTF. α-Tropomyosin, encoded by the TPM1 locus, is a 284-amino acid residue, 33-kDa α-helical coiled-coil protein that associates with actin filaments as a homodimer. The Tm sequence has characteristic heptad repeats (Fig. 1) stabilized by hydrophobic core residues at the a and d positions, with predominantly hydrophilic residues at the b, c, and f positions on the surface. Flexibility is imparted by kinks and alanine clusters and is important for regulatory functions. The Tm sequence also can be visualized as seven periods, each divided into an N-terminal α band and C-terminal β band. The α bands are involved in interaction with actin and the β bands in interaction with the myosin head (15Hitchcock-DeGregori S.E. Song Y. Greenfield N.J.

What makes tropomyosin an actin binding protein? A perspective.J. Struct. Biol. 2010; 170: 319-324Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). The head-to-tail association of Tm dimers forms a continuous super-helical cable that matches the contours of F-actin and imparts cooperativity to regulatory interactions (17Greenfield N.J. Palm T.

Of 30 identified mutations in human TPM1 (19Redwood C. Robinson P. α-Tropomyosin mutations in inherited cardiomyopathies.J. Muscle Res. Cell Motil. 2013; 34: 285-294Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar), four (E40K, E54K, D175N, and E180G) have been characterized more than the others. E40K and E54K are DCM-causing mutants that decrease Ca2+ sensitivity in ATPase assays and lower tension at high Ca2+ concentrations in myofiber experiments, whereas the HCM-causing mutants D175N and E180G show opposite changes to the DCM mutants (19Redwood C.

M281T may affect the head-to-tail overlap between Tm dimers. The other substitutions are on the outside surface of the coiled coil, regions that may alter interactions with actin, myosin, or the Tn complex.

The residue is located in the C-terminal half of Tm period 5 and is likely to function to stabilize the blocked and closed states via electrostatic interactions with actin. This leads to the prediction that a charge reversal will displace Tm from the blocking position and lead to hypersensitivity. To test this hypothesis, we created E181K and analyzed it along with the seven mutants known to cause cardiomyopathy. Overall, our suite of assays suggested a surprising degree of mechanistic heterogeneity in that alterations in Ca2+ sensitivity could not be attributed to any single parameter of Tm function. Hence, we propose that a more fine-grained categorization of mechanisms could lead to better small molecule amelioration of disease. Plasmids encoding human cardiac isoforms of α-Tm with an Ala-Ser N-terminal dipeptide, TnC, TnT, and TnI were kindly provided by James D. Potter, University of Miami. The plasmid encoding the triple mutant of TnC (C35S, T53C, C84S; hereafter TnC3) was constructed as described (33Sommese R.F. Nag S. Sutton S. Miller S.M. Spudich J.A. Ruppel K.M.

The mutations were introduced by standard site-directed mutagenesis. All mutants were confirmed by DNA sequencing. Escherichia coli Rosetta cells were transformed, selected with ampicillin and chloramphenicol, grown in terrific broth at 37 °C to an A600 of ∼1, induced with 1 mm isopropyl 1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside for 4 h at 25 °C, and pelleted.

The pellet was dialyzed into 20 mm Tris, 1 mm EDTA, 100 mm NaCl, 1 mm DTT, pH 7.5, at 4 °C and purified over DE52 or Q-Sepharose. Tm was eluted using a gradient from 0.1 to 1 m NaCl. The fractions containing Tm were pooled and dialyzed into equilibration buffer (5 mm sodium phosphate, 1 m NaCl, 1 mm DTT) for hydroxyapatite chromatography. The Tm was eluted using an increasing gradient of phosphate up to 400 mm. Positive fractions were run on a gel to confirm purity, and the pure concentrated fractions were pooled.

Our laboratory previously demonstrated that diabetes-induced VEGF expression in the retina was dependent on the repressor of mRNA translation 4E-BP1. Interaction of 4E-BP1 with the cap-binding protein eIF4E regulates protein expression by controlling the selection of mRNAs for translation. The process is regulated by the master kinase mTOR in complex 1 (mTORC1), which phosphorylates 4E-BP1, thus promoting its disassociation from eIF4E. In the present study, we investigated the role of the Akt/mTORC1 repressor REDD1 (regulated in development and DNA damage) in diabetes-induced VEGF expression. REDD1 expression was induced by hyperglycemia in the retina of diabetic rodents and by hyperglycemic conditions in Müller cells concomitant with increased VEGF expression. In Müller cells, hyperglycemic conditions attenuated global rates of protein synthesis and cap-dependent mRNA translation concomitant with up-regulated cap-independent VEGF mRNA translation, as assessed by a bicistronic luciferase reporter assay. Hyperglycemic conditions also attenuated mTORC1 signaling and enhanced 4E-BP1 binding to eIF4E. Furthermore, ectopic expression of REDD1 in Müller cells was sufficient to promote both increased 4E-BP1 binding to eIF4E and VEGF expression. Whereas the retina of wild-type mice exhibited increased expression of VEGF and tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-α) 4 weeks after streptozotocin administration, the retina of REDD1 knock-out mice failed to do so. Overall, the results demonstrate that REDD1 contributes to the pathogenesis of diabetes in the retina by mediating the pathogenic effects of hyperglycemia.Background: VEGF plays a causal role in diabetic retinopathy.Results: Hyperglycemia induced VEGF and REDD1 expression in the retina of wild-type, but not REDD1 knock-out mice.Conclusion: REDD1 is necessary for hyperglycemia mediated effects on VEGF expression in the retina of diabetic mice.Significance: Molecular therapies targeting REDD1 could prove useful in preventing pathological effects of hyperglycemia.

Ribosome recruitment to the mRNA 5′-end serves as the rate-controlling step in translation and in mammalian cells is classically thought of as occurring through mechanisms that are either dependent on or independent of a m7GTP cap.

The Akt/mTORC1 (master kinase mammalian target of rapamycin complex 1) signaling pathway regulates mRNA translation by governing assembly of the mRNA cap-binding complex, eIF4F, which is composed of eIF4E, eIF4G, and eIF4A (8Thoreen C.C. Many roads from mTOR to eIF4F.Biochem. Soc. Trans. 2013; 41: 913-916Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). In their hypophosphorylated state, eIF4E-binding proteins (4E-BPs) sequester the cap-binding protein eIF4E away from eIF4G and thus inhibit cap-dependent mRNA translation. However upon phosphorylation by mTORC1, 4E-BPs are released from eIF4E, allowing assembly of the eIF4F-complex and thus a concomitant increase in cap-dependent and a decrease in cap-independent mRNA translation. We previously demonstrated that hyperglycemic conditions enhanced relative cap-independent translation in the liver of diabetic mice and in cells in culture and that 4E-BP1 is necessary for the effect (9Dennis M.D. Shenberger J.S.

These previous studies from our laboratory (18Dennis M.D. Schrufer T.L. Bronson S.K. Kimball S.R. Jefferson L.S. Hyperglycemia-Induced O-GlcNAcylation and Truncation of 4E-BP1 Protein in Liver of a Mouse Model of Type 1 Diabetes.J. Biol. Chem. 2011; 286: 34286-34297Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar) demonstrate that the effect of diabetes-induced hyperglycemia on 4E-BP1 is mediated at least in part through the covalent addition of O-linked N-acetylglucosamine (O-GlcNAcylation). Regulation of mRNA translation and specifically sequestration of eIF4E by 4E-BP1 potentially represent a key mechanism in the pathological VEGF expression associated with DR. However, the relative contribution of reduced phosphorylation and increased O-GlcNAcylation of 4E-BP1 in diabetes-induced VEGF expression is unexplored. Thus, we set out to evaluate the signaling mechanisms whereby hyperglycemia alters mRNA translation in the retina. The protein Regulated in Development and DNA Damage 1 (REDD1; also known as DNA-damage-inducible transcript 4 (DDIT4), dexamethasone-induced gene 2 (Dig2), and RTP801) governs phosphorylation of 4E-BP1 through inhibition of Akt/mTORC1 signaling (11Dennis M.D. Coleman C.S.

Signal. 2014; 7: ra68Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar). Our laboratory previously reported increased REDD1 protein and mRNA expression in the muscle of diabetic mice (12McGhee N.K. Jefferson L.S. Kimball S.R. Elevated corticosterone associated with food deprivation upregulates expression in rat skeletal muscle of the mTORC1 repressor, REDD1.J. Nutr. 2009; 139: 828-834Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar), and more recent reports have shown enhanced REDD1 mRNA expression in the retinal pigment epithelium/choroid of diabetic rats (13Rittenhouse K.D. Johnson T.R. Vicini P. Hirakawa B. Kalabat D. Yang A.H. Huang W. Basile A.S. RTP801 gene expression is differentially upregulated in retinopathy and is silenced by PF-04523655, a 19-Mer siRNA directed against RTP801.Invest Ophthalmol. Vis. Sci. 2014; 55: 1232-1240Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). Thus, in the present study we set out to test the hypothesis that diabetes-induced REDD1 protein expression represents a translational control mechanism that contributes to enhanced VEGF expression in the retina. The results show that hyperglycemia, rather than reduced insulin availability, plays a dominant role in inducing both VEGF mRNA translation and REDD1 expression. Moreover, diabetes failed to promote expression of either VEGF or the proinflammatory marker TNF-α in the retina of REDD1 knock-out mice, demonstrating a critical role for REDD1 in diabetes-induced pathology of the retina.

Cells were maintained in DMEM containing 5 mm glucose and supplemented with 10% heat-inactivated FBS (Atlas Biologicals) and 1% penicillin/streptomycin (Invitrogen). Cells were maintained at either 37 °C (MIO-M1 and MEFs) or 33 °C (TR-MUL) and 5% CO2 atmosphere. For studies on the effects of hyperglycemic conditions, cell culture medium was replaced with medium containing 10% FBS and either 30 mm glucose or 5 mm glucose with 25 mm mannitol as an osmotic control added 16 h prior to harvest or as indicated. Global rates of protein synthesis were calculated by the incorporation of 35S-labeled methionine into TCA-precipitable protein as previously described (17Dennis M.D. Jefferson L.S. Kimball S.R.

A fraction of the supernatant was added to 1× SDS sample buffer, boiled for 5 min, and analyzed by Western blotting as previously described (10Schrufer T.L. Antonetti D.A. Sonenberg N. Kimball S.R.

Another fraction of the supernatant was evaluated with a Mouse VEGF Quantikine ELISA (R&D systems). RNA was extracted from cells with TRIzol reagent according to the manufacturer's instructions (Invitrogen). RNA (1 μg) was reverse transcribed using a High Capacity cDNA Reverse Transcription Kit (Applied Biosystems) and subjected to quantitative real-time PCR using QuantiTect SYBR Green master mix (Qiagen). QuantiTect SYBR Green primers were used for rat Vegfa and Actb (Qiagen). Primers for mouse Vegfa were as follows: forward 5′-gag aga ggc cga agt cct tt-3′, reverse 5′-ttg gaa ccg gca tct tta tc-3′. Primers for mouse Gapdh were as previously described (19Gordon B.S. Steiner J.L. Lang C.H. Jefferson L.S. Kimball S.R. Reduced REDD1 expression contributes to activation of mTORC1 following electrically induced muscle contraction.Am. J. Physiol. Endocrinol. Metab. 2014; 307: E703-711Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). The data are expressed as mean ± S.E. Analysis of variance was used to identify differences between group means. When identified, Student's t test was used post hoc to compare differences among groups. p < 0.05 was considered statistically significant. REDD1 protein expression was assessed in the retina of diabetic rats by Western blot analysis. Following 4 weeks of STZ-induced diabetes, REDD1 expression was increased in the retina of diabetic rats as compared with non-diabetic controls (Fig. 1A). We have previously reported decreased phosphorylation of 4E-BP1 on Thr37/46 concomitant with elevated VEGF abundance in the retina of diabetic rats (10Schrufer T.L. Antonetti D.A. Sonenberg N. Kimball S.R. Gardner T.W. Jefferson L.S. Ablation of 4E-BP1/2 prevents hyperglycemia-mediated induction of VEGF expression in the rodent retina and in Muller cells in culture.Diabetes. 2010; 59: 2107-2116Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). When analyzed by SDS-PAGE, 4E-BP1 can be resolved into multiple phospho-isoforms based upon a reduced migratory capacity that is associated with increased phosphorylation. In the present study, relative 4E-BP1 phosphorylation was lower in the retina of diabetic rats compared with control rats as assessed by the proportion of the protein present in the hyperphosphorylated γ isoform relative to total 4E-BP1 (i.e. the sum of the α, β, and γ isoforms, Fig. 1B). As expected, the abundance of VEGF was also increased as compared with non-diabetic cohorts (Fig. 1C). To specifically evaluate the contribution of diabetes-induced hyperglycemia to these changes, normalization of blood glucose levels by phlorizin was used to achieve glycemic control. As previously observed (20Fort P.E. Losiewicz M.K. Reiter C.E. Singh R.S. Nakamura M. Abcouwer S.F. Barber A.J. Gardner T.W. Differential roles of hyperglycemia and hypoinsulinemia in diabetes induced retinal cell death: evidence for retinal insulin resistance.PLoS One. 2011; 6: e26498Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar), twice-daily administration of phlorizin reduced serum glucose levels in diabetic rats close to normal levels independently of insulin (145.0 ± 23.0 mg.dL−1 in control versus 547.3 ± 21.5 mg.dL−1 in diabetic and 214.9 ± 21.1 mg.dL−1 in diabetic treated with phlorizin). Normalization of serum glucose concentrations also reduced the abundance of REDD1 (Fig. 1A), enhanced phosphorylation of 4E-BP1 (Fig. 1B), and reduced VEGF abundance (Fig. 1C) in the retina of diabetic rats, such that levels were no longer different than those observed in non-diabetic controls. These findings demonstrate that hyperglycemia contributes to the effect of diabetes on these key signaling proteins in the retina. To further evaluate the effect of hyperglycemia on REDD1 and VEGF abundance, we employed Müller cells in culture exposed to medium containing either control (5 mm) or high (30 mm) concentrations of glucose (i.e. a hyperglycemic condition). Müller cells are the main glial cells of the retina and a likely target of hyperglycemia (21Mizutani M. Gerhardinger C. Lorenzi M. Muller cell changes in human diabetic retinopathy.Diabetes. 1998; 47: 445-449Crossref PubMed Scopus (402) Google Scholar, 22Zhong Y. Li J. Chen Y. Wang J.J. Ratan R. Zhang S.X. Activation of endoplasmic reticulum stress by hyperglycemia is essential for Muller cell-derived inflammatory cytokine production in diabetes.Diabetes. 2012; 61: 492-504Crossref PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar). Furthermore, Müller cells are activated early in the progression of DR (21Mizutani M. Gerhardinger C. Lorenzi M. Muller cell changes in human diabetic retinopathy.Diabetes. 1998; 47: 445-449Crossref PubMed Scopus (402) Google Scholar) and are among the cells responsible for the synthesis and expression of a number of growth factors including VEGF that play a causative role in retinal inflammation, vascular lesions, and increased permeability that characterize the disease (23Shelton M.D. Distler A.M. Kern T.S. Mieyal J.J. Glutaredoxin regulates autocrine and paracrine proinflammatory responses in retinal glial (muller) cells.J. Biol. Chem. 2009; 284: 4760-4766Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar, 24Wang J. Xu X. Elliott M.H. Zhu M. Le Y.Z. Muller cell-derived VEGF is essential for diabetes-induced retinal inflammation and vascular leakage.Diabetes. 2010; 59: 2297-2305Crossref PubMed Scopus (290) Google Scholar). In both human MI0-M1 (Fig. 2A) and rat TR-MUL (Fig. 2B) Müller cells in culture, exposure to medium containing 30 mm glucose increased the abundance of REDD1 and VEGF as compared with control medium containing 5 mm glucose with 25 mm mannitol added as an osmotic control. Furthermore, increased REDD1 and VEGF abundance was detected in TR-MUL cells as early as 4 h after exposure to high glucose and was maintained through 24 h (Fig. 2C). Hyperglycemic conditions did not alter VEGF mRNA expression as compared with an osmotic control (Fig. 2D). Although transcriptional changes are strongly correlated with those seen in VEGF protein following prolonged exposure of retinal cells to hyperglycemic conditions (i.e. >72 h), elevated VEGF protein expression precedes the change in VEGF mRNA (25Donovan K. Alekseev O. Qi X. Cho W. Azizkhan-Clifford J. O-GlcNAc Modification of Transcription Factor Sp1 Mediates Hyperglycemia-Induced VEGF-A Upregulation in Retinal Cells.Invest Ophthalmol Vis. Sci. 2014; 55: 7862-7873Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). Thus, a post-transcriptional control mechanism allows retinal cells to acutely responded to hyperglycemia. To evaluate the effect of hyperglycemic conditions on global rates of protein synthesis, the incorporation of 35S-labeled methionine into cellular protein was assessed. Global protein synthesis was reduced in TR-MUL cells following exposure to 30 mm glucose (Fig. 2E). Thus, an increase in the overall rate of protein synthesis was not responsible for the induction of VEGF protein expression following exposure to hyperglycemic conditions. To specifically evaluate VEGF mRNA translation in TR-MUL cells, we ectopically expressed a bicistronic plasmid containing two open reading frames (ORF) encoding two distinct luciferase enzymes, LucR and LucF (9Dennis M.D. Shenberger J.S. Stanley B.A. Kimball S.R. Jefferson L.S. Hyperglycemia mediates a shift from cap-dependent to cap-independent translation via a 4E-BP1-dependent mechanism.Diabetes. 2013; 62: 2204-2214Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). Translation of the first ORF (LucR) occurs in a cap-dependent manner, whereas translation of the second ORF (LucF) is driven by the VEGF IRES that is located between the two cistrons (Fig. 2F). Thus, LucF activity functions as a reporter of cap-independent translation. Whereas hyperglycemia attenuated cap-dependent translation (Fig. 2G), cap-independent translation was enhanced (Fig. 2H). Overall, the relative LucF/LucR activity ratio in TR-MUL lysates was increased by 54% upon exposure to hyperglycemic conditions (Fig. 2I). The best characterized mechanism for controlling the shift from cap-dependent to cap-independent mRNA translation involves assembly of the eIF4F complex (27Svitkin Y.V. Herdy B. Costa-Mattioli M. Gingras A.C. Raught B. Sonenberg N. Eukaryotic translation initiation factor 4E availability controls the switch between cap-dependent and internal ribosomal entry site-mediated translation.Mol. Cell. Biol. 2005; 25: 10556-10565Crossref PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar), a process that is regulated by the mTORC1 signaling pathway (8Thoreen C.C. Many roads from mTOR to eIF4F.Biochem. Soc. Trans. 2013; 41: 913-916Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). Since the effects of hyperglycemia are potentially mediated by repression of mTORC1, we initially evaluated Akt/mTORC1 signaling in TR-MUL cells following exposure to medium containing high glucose concentrations. We recently demonstrated that REDD1 acts to repress mTORC1 by promoting the association of protein phosphatase 2A with Akt, leading to the site-specific dephosphorylation of the kinase on Thr308, a subsequent reduction in Akt-mediated phosphorylation of TSC2, and a fall in the proportion of Rheb in the active GTP-bound state (11Dennis M.D. Coleman C.S. Berg A. Jefferson L.S. Kimball S.R. REDD1 enhances protein phosphatase 2A-mediated dephosphorylation of Akt to repress mTORC1 signaling.Sci. Signal. 2014; 7: ra68Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar). Direct interaction of Rheb-GTP, but not Rheb-GDP, with mTORC1 results in its activation and thus promotes hyperphosphorylation of 4E-BP1 and p70S6K1 (28Long X. Lin Y. Ortiz-Vega S. Yonezawa K. Avruch J. Rheb binds and regulates the mTOR kinase.Curr. Biol. 2005; 15: 702-713Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (746) Google Scholar). Following exposure to medium containing high glucose concentrations, Akt phosphorylation was attenuated at the REDD1-sensitive Thr308 site, but not at Ser473 following (Fig. 3A). Furthermore, as compared with osmotic controls, hyperglycemic conditions attenuated mTORC1 signaling in both MI0-M1 (Fig. 3B) and TR-MUL Müller (Fig. 3C) cells in culture as assessed by p70S6K1 phosphorylation on Thr389. Importantly, the high glucose-induced phosphorylation changes on both Akt and p70S6K1 we"

Methods This is a cross-sectional study using a screening questionnaire and semi-structured interviews for data collection. Thirty-one women filled out the questionnaire and 23 of them were later interviewed. The questionnaires were analyzed by descriptive statistics. The interviews were recorded, transcribed verbatim and analyzed with qualitative content analysis. Most Important Findings Indications for the abortion were fetal malformation or unintended pregnancy. The women expressed similar feelings and these were irrespective for the reason for having an abortion. Both physical and mental pain was experienced during the abortion process and described by the women. Taking the mifepristone-pill was experienced as especially emotionally difficult for many participants. Professional support from the staff together with support from the partner, a friend or relative helped in transforming the worries related to something unknown to feelings of coping with a new and hard experience. Prior to the abortion most women stated that they did not want to view the fetus but women who chose to view the fetus described this as a way of confronting the reality and an opportunity to say farewell to the pregnancy/fetus. The analysis of the interview transcripts revealed five themes mirroring the women's experiences, thoughts and feelings related to the abortion. Conclusions The decision to undergo second trimester abortion sometimes exposes women to strong and conflicting emotions which are irrespective for the reason for having an abortion. Despite this women do not regret their decision to terminate the pregnancy. This analysis shows that their rational thinking outweighs their emotionally difficult feelings. It is important for the attending staff to be responsive to the needs of each individual woman whatever the indication is for the abortion."
https://openalex.org/W2074830578,"Cyclooxygenases (COXs) catalyze the committed step in prostaglandin (PG) biosynthesis. COX-1 is constitutively expressed and stable, whereas COX-2 is inducible and short lived. COX-2 is degraded via endoplasmic reticulum (ER)-associated degradation (ERAD) following post-translational glycosylation of Asn-594. COX-1 and COX-2 are found in abundance on the luminal surfaces of the ER and inner membrane of the nuclear envelope. Using confocal immunocytofluorescence, we detected both COX-2 and microsomal PGE synthase-1 (mPGES-1) but not COX-1 in the Golgi apparatus. Inhibition of trafficking between the ER and Golgi retarded COX-2 ERAD. COX-2 has a C-terminal STEL sequence, which is an inefficient ER retention signal. Substituting this sequence with KDEL, a robust ER retention signal, concentrated COX-2 in the ER where it was stable and slowly glycosylated on Asn-594. Native COX-2 and a recombinant COX-2 having a Golgi targeting signal but not native COX-1 exhibited efficient catalytic coupling to mPGES-1. We conclude that N-glycosylation of Asn-594 of COX-2 occurs in the ER, leading to anterograde movement of COX-2 to the Golgi where the Asn-594-linked glycan is trimmed prior to retrograde COX-2 transport to the ER for ERAD. Having an inefficient ER retention signal leads to sluggish Golgi to ER transit of COX-2. This permits significant Golgi residence time during which COX-2 can function catalytically. Cytosolic phospholipase A2α, which mobilizes arachidonic acid for PG synthesis, preferentially translocates to the Golgi in response to physiologic Ca(2+) mobilization. We propose that cytosolic phospholipase A2α, COX-2, and mPGES-1 in the Golgi comprise a dedicated system for COX-2-dependent PGE2 biosynthesis."
https://openalex.org/W1964894262,"Mouse pluripotent stem cells (PSCs), such as ES cells and induced PSCs (iPSCs), are an excellent system to investigate the molecular and cellular mechanisms involved in early embryonic development. The signaling pathways orchestrated by leukemia inhibitor factor/STAT3, Wnt/β-catenin, and FGF/MEK/ERK play key roles in the generation of pluripotency. However, the function of TGF-β signaling in this process remains elusive. Here we show that inhibiting TGF-β signaling with its inhibitor SB431542 can substitute for Oct4 during reprogramming. Moreover, inhibiting TGF-β signaling can sustain the pluripotency of iPSCs and ES cells through modulating FGF/MEK/ERK signaling. Therefore, this study reveals a novel function of TGF-β signaling inhibition in the generation and maintenance of PSCs."
https://openalex.org/W2108550484,"The pancreas is composed of both exocrine glands and intermingled endocrine cells to execute its diverse functions, including enzyme production for digestion of nutrients and hormone secretion for regulation of blood glucose levels. To define the molecular constituents with elevated expression in the human pancreas, we employed a genome-wide RNA sequencing analysis of the human transcriptome to identify genes with elevated expression in the human pancreas. This quantitative transcriptomics data was combined with immunohistochemistry-based protein profiling to allow mapping of the corresponding proteins to different compartments and specific cell types within the pancreas down to the single cell level. Analysis of whole pancreas identified 146 genes with elevated expression levels, of which 47 revealed a particular higher expression as compared to the other analyzed tissue types, thus termed pancreas enriched. Extended analysis of in vitro isolated endocrine islets identified an additional set of 42 genes with elevated expression in these specialized cells. Although only 0.7% of all genes showed an elevated expression level in the pancreas, this fraction of transcripts, in most cases encoding secreted proteins, constituted 68% of the total mRNA in pancreas. This demonstrates the extreme specialization of the pancreas for production of secreted proteins. Among the elevated expression profiles, several previously not described proteins were identified, both in endocrine cells (CFC1, FAM159B, RBPJL and RGS9) and exocrine glandular cells (AQP12A, DPEP1, GATM and ERP27). In summary, we provide a global analysis of the pancreas transcriptome and proteome with a comprehensive list of genes and proteins with elevated expression in pancreas. This list represents an important starting point for further studies of the molecular repertoire of pancreatic cells and their relation to disease states or treatment effects."
https://openalex.org/W2042181177,"Background Thymic stromal lymphoproetin (TSLP) is a cytokine secreted by the airway epithelium in response to respiratory viruses and it is known to promote allergic Th2 responses in asthma. This study investigated whether virally-induced secretion of TSLP is directional in nature (apical vs. basolateral) and/or if there are TSLP-mediated effects occurring at both sides of the bronchial epithelial barrier in the asthmatic state. Methods Primary human bronchial epithelial cells (HBEC) from control (n = 3) and asthmatic (n = 3) donors were differentiated into polarized respiratory tract epithelium under air-liquid interface (ALI) conditions and treated apically with dsRNA (viral surrogate) or TSLP. Sub-epithelial effects of TSLP were examined in human airway smooth muscle cells (HASMC) from normal (n = 3) and asthmatic (n = 3) donors. Clinical experiments examined nasal airway secretions obtained from asthmatic children during naturally occurring rhinovirus-induced exacerbations (n = 20) vs. non-asthmatic uninfected controls (n = 20). Protein levels of TSLP, CCL11/eotaxin-1, CCL17/TARC, CCL22/MDC, TNF-α and CXCL8 were determined with a multiplex magnetic bead assay. Results Our data demonstrate that: 1) Asthmatic HBEC exhibit an exaggerated apical, but not basal, secretion of TSLP after dsRNA exposure; 2) TSLP exposure induces unidirectional (apical) secretion of CCL11/eotaxin-1 in asthmatic HBEC and enhanced CCL11/eotaxin-1 secretion in asthmatic HASMC; 3) Rhinovirus-induced asthma exacerbations in children are associated with in vivo airway secretion of TSLP and CCL11/eotaxin-1. Conclusions There are virally-induced TSLP-driven secretory immune responses at both sides of the bronchial epithelial barrier characterized by enhanced CCL11/eotaxin-1 secretion in asthmatic airways. These results suggest a new model of TSLP-mediated eosinophilic responses in the asthmatic airway during viral-induced exacerbations."
https://openalex.org/W2052504838,"Pseudomonas syringae employs a type III secretion system to inject 20-30 different type III effector (T3SE) proteins into plant host cells. A major role of T3SEs is to suppress plant immune responses and promote bacterial infection. The YopJ/HopZ acetyltransferases are a superfamily of T3SEs found in both plant and animal pathogenic bacteria. In P. syringae, this superfamily includes the evolutionarily diverse HopZ1, HopZ2 and HopZ3 alleles. To investigate the roles of the HopZ family in immunomodulation, we generated dexamethasone-inducible T3SE transgenic lines of Arabidopsis for HopZ family members and characterized them for immune suppression phenotypes. We show that all of the HopZ family members can actively suppress various facets of Arabidopsis immunity in a catalytic residue-dependent manner. HopZ family members can differentially suppress the activation of mitogen-activated protein (MAP) kinase cascades or the production of reactive oxygen species, whereas all members can promote the growth of non-virulent P. syringae. Localization studies show that four of the HopZ family members containing predicted myristoylation sites are localized to the vicinity of the plasma membrane while HopZ3 which lacks the myristoylation site is at least partially nuclear localized, suggesting diversification of immunosuppressive mechanisms. Overall, we demonstrate that despite significant evolutionary diversification, all HopZ family members can suppress immunity in Arabidopsis."
https://openalex.org/W2021884639,"Pregnancy-specific glycoproteins (PSGs) are a family of Ig-like proteins secreted by specialized placental cells. The PSG1 structure is composed of a single Ig variable region-like N-terminal domain and three Ig constant region-like domains termed A1, A2, and B2. Members of the human and murine PSG family have been shown to induce anti-inflammatory cytokines from monocytes and macrophages and to stimulate angiogenesis. We recently showed that recombinant forms of PSG1 (PSG1-Fc and PSG1-His) and PSG1 purified from the serum of pregnant women are associated with the immunoregulatory cytokine TGF-β1 and activated latent TGF-β1. Here, we sought to examine the requirement of specific PSG1 domains in the activation of latent TGF-β1. Plasmon surface resonance studies showed that PSG1 directly bound to the small latent complex and to the latency-associated peptide of TGF-β1 and that this binding was mediated through the B2 domain. Furthermore, the B2 domain alone was sufficient for activating the small latent complex. In separate experiments, we found that the PSG1-mediated induction of TGF-β1 secretion in macrophages was dependent on the N-terminal domain. Mutagenesis analysis revealed that four amino acids (LYHY) of the CC′ loop of the N-terminal domain were required for induction of latent TGF-β1 secretion. Together, our results show that two distinct domains of PSG1 are involved in the regulation of TGF-β1 and provide a mechanistic framework for how PSGs modulate the immunoregulatory environment at the maternal-fetal interface for successful pregnancy outcome. Pregnancy-specific glycoproteins (PSGs) are a family of Ig-like proteins secreted by specialized placental cells. The PSG1 structure is composed of a single Ig variable region-like N-terminal domain and three Ig constant region-like domains termed A1, A2, and B2. Members of the human and murine PSG family have been shown to induce anti-inflammatory cytokines from monocytes and macrophages and to stimulate angiogenesis. We recently showed that recombinant forms of PSG1 (PSG1-Fc and PSG1-His) and PSG1 purified from the serum of pregnant women are associated with the immunoregulatory cytokine TGF-β1 and activated latent TGF-β1. Here, we sought to examine the requirement of specific PSG1 domains in the activation of latent TGF-β1. Plasmon surface resonance studies showed that PSG1 directly bound to the small latent complex and to the latency-associated peptide of TGF-β1 and that this binding was mediated through the B2 domain. Furthermore, the B2 domain alone was sufficient for activating the small latent complex.

There are 10 protein-coding human PSG genes, PSG1–PSG9 and PSG11 (PSG10 is a noncoding pseudogene) arrayed within a genomic region of 0.55 Mb in chromosome 19 (Ensembl) (1.Teglund S. Olsen A. Khan W.N. Frängsmyr L. Hammarström S.

PSGs share membership in the Ig superfamily with the structurally related carcinoembryonic antigen-related cell adhesion molecules (CEACAMs). The human PSG structure consists of an Ig variable region-like N-terminal domain, followed by two or three Ig constant region type 2-like domains termed A1, A2, and B2. The human PSG structure differs from murine PSGs in that most of the murine PSGs contain three Ig variable region-like N-terminal domains and a single Ig constant region type 2-like A domain (2.McLellan A.S. Fischer B. Dveksler G. Hori T. Wynne F. Ball M. Okumura K. Moore T. Zimmermann W. Structure and evolution of the mouse pregnancy-specific glycoprotein (Psg) gene locus.BMC Genomics. 2005; 6: 4Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). Because the PSG1 mRNA is relatively highly expressed compared with other PSGs in the first trimester of pregnancy and in the term placenta, we concentrated our studies on this member of the family (3.Shanley D.K. Kiely P.A. Golla K. Allen S. Martin K. O'Riordan R.T. Ball M. Aplin J.D. Singer B.B. Caplice N. Moran N. Moore T. Pregnancy-specific glycoproteins bind integrin αIIbβ3 and inhibit the platelet-fibrinogen interaction.PLoS ONE. 2013; 8: e57491Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). Several studies support the hypothesis that PSGs contribute to the immunoregulatory environment required for fetal tolerance. PSG1, PSG6, and PSG11 induce the secretion of cytokines IL-10, IL-6, and TGF-β1 in human monocytes, and the PSG6 N-terminal domain alone is sufficient for the induction of TGF-β1 secretion (4.Snyder S.K. Wessner D.H. Wessells J.L. Waterhouse R.M. Wahl L.M. Zimmermann W. Dveksler G.S.

Immunol. 2001; 45: 205-216Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar). PSGs also regulate dendritic and macrophage cell function, thereby directing T cell activation (5.Martínez F.F. Knubel C.P. Sánchez M.C. Cervi L. Motrán C.C. Pregnancy-specific glycoprotein 1a activates dendritic cells to provide signals for Th17-, Th2-, and Treg-cell polarization.Eur. J.

In clinical studies, low serum PSG concentrations during the first trimester of pregnancy correlated with adverse pregnancy outcomes, including preterm delivery and small birth weight (7.Pihl K.

Investigation of potential receptors for PSGs revealed that the tetraspanin CD9 binds murine PSG17, but not PSG23; however, both PSG17 and PSG23 were found to bind to cellular proteoglycans via the N-terminal domain (8.Waterhouse R.

Human PSG1 also binds cell-surface proteoglycans (10.Lisboa F.A. Warren J. Sulkowski G. Aparicio M. David G. Zudaire E. Dveksler G.S.

TGF-β1 is a pleiotropic cytokine produced by a variety of hematopoietic and non-hematopoietic cells and is critical for angiogenesis, embryogenesis, cell matrix synthesis, and immune system regulation, including lymphocyte differentiation and inhibition of macrophage and dendritic cell activation (11.Li M.O. Wan Y.Y. Sanjabi S. Robertson A.K. Flavell R.A. Transforming growth factor-β regulation of immune responses.Annu. Rev. Immunol. 2006; 24: 99-146Crossref PubMed Scopus (1750) Google Scholar). TGF-β1 plays a role in many biological processes, and its activity is highly regulated. TGF-β1 is produced in a biologically inactive form, covalently associated with the latency-associated peptide (LAP), and cannot signal unless this TGF-β1·LAP complex, also known as the small latent complex (SLC), is activated. Activation of latent TGF-β1 results in the proteolysis, dissociation, or altered binding of LAP to TGF-β1, allowing free TGF-β1 to bind its receptors (12.Annes J.P. Munger J.S. Rifkin D.B. Making sense of latent TGFβ activation.J. Cell Sci. 2003; 116: 217-224Crossref PubMed Scopus (1319) Google Scholar). Factors that activate latent TGF-β1 include plasmin, metalloproteases, selected integrins, neuropilin-1, and thrombospondin-1 (TSP-1), as well as heat, low pH, and shear stress (12.Annes J.P.

We recently showed that both full-length PSG1 and PSG1-Fc, which contains three domains (N-terminal, A2, and B2), activate SLC of TGF-β1 (15.Blois S.M. Sulkowski G. Tirado-González I. Warren J. Freitag N. Klapp B.F. Rifkin D. Fuss I. Strober W. Dveksler G.S. Pregnancy-specific glycoprotein 1 (PSG1) activates TGF-β and prevents dextran sodium sulfate (DSS)-induced colitis in mice.Mucosal Immunol. 2014; 7: 348-358Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). This finding led to the hypothesis that PSG1 could have therapeutic potential as a novel anti-inflammatory therapy. In vivo studies showed that PSG1-Fc treatment reduced inflammation in a TGF-β1-dependent manner in a model of dextran sodium sulfate-induced colitis (15.Blois S.M. Sulkowski G. Tirado-González I. Warren J. Freitag N. Klapp B.F. Rifkin D. Fuss I. Strober W. Dveksler G.S. Pregnancy-specific glycoprotein 1 (PSG1) activates TGF-β and prevents dextran sodium sulfate (DSS)-induced colitis in mice.Mucosal Immunol. 2014; 7: 348-358Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). To study the activation of SLC by PSG1, we performed surface plasmon resonance (SPR) experiments to characterize the interaction between these proteins. These experiments showed that PSG1 directly bound LAP in the presence or absence of the TGF-β1 polypeptide. To examine the contribution of specific domains of PSG1-Fc to activation of SLC, we expressed PSG1 domains independently fused to the Fc portion of human IgG1 (PSG1-N-Fc, PSG1-A2-Fc and PSG1-B2-Fc). We used the PSG1 single-domain constructs in SPR experiments to characterize their binding to LAP and SLC and determined that LAP binding was mediated via the Ig constant region type 2-like B2 domain. In addition, the B2 domain was found to be sufficient for latent TGF-β1 activation. To date, few factors have been described that induce the secretion of TGF-β1 in distinct cell populations. In addition to PSGs, the induction of TGF-β1 has been described in macrophages treated with apoptotic lymphocytes (16.Fadok V.A. Bratton D.L. Konowal A. Freed P.W. Westcott J.Y. Henson P.M. Macrophages that have ingested apoptotic cells in vitro inhibit proinflammatory cytokine production through autocrine/paracrine mechanisms involving TGF-β, PGE2, and PAF.J. Clin.

Decreased production of TGF-β1 by human alveolar macrophages compared with blood monocytes.J. Immunol. 1996; 156: 3461-3468PubMed Google Scholar). We re-examined the induction of TGF-β1 by PSG1 and found that the N-terminal domain alone is sufficient for macrophage TGF-β1 production. In addition, we identified the region within the N-terminal domain required for TGF-β1 induction: a four-amino acid sequence (LYHY) located in the CC′ loop. With these studies, we characterized the binding and activation of TGF-β1 via PSG1 and defined two domains of PSG1 capable of regulating TGF-β1 biological activity. PSG1-Fc and CEACAM9-Fc were generated as described previously (15.Blois S.M. Sulkowski G. Tirado-González I. Warren J. Freitag N. Klapp B.F. Rifkin D. Fuss I. Strober W. Dveksler G.S. Pregnancy-specific glycoprotein 1 (PSG1) activates TGF-β and prevents dextran sodium sulfate (DSS)-induced colitis in mice.Mucosal Immunol. 2014; 7: 348-358Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). The PSG1 single-domain mutants were generated as follows. The cDNA consisting of the PSG1 leader peptide followed by the indicated domain was synthesized by GenScript USA Inc. (Piscataway, NJ) and subcloned into the EcoRI-BglII sites of the pFUSE-IgG1-e3-Fc1 vector (InvivoGen, San Diego, CA), resulting in the in-frame addition of the hinge region and CH2 and CH3 domains (Fc tag) of the IgG1 heavy chain. PSG1-His has a His6 tag at the N- and C-terminal ends of the protein and was purified from the supernatant of stably transfected CHO-K1 cells grown on a C2003 hollow fiber cell culture cartridge (FiberCell Systems, Frederick, MD) on an anti-PSG1 monoclonal antibody 4 column. Monoclonal antibody 4 was obtained from Dr. S. Jonjic (University of Rijeka, Rijeka, Croatia) and was previously used to purify PSG1 from the serum of pregnant women (15.Blois S.M. Sulkowski G. Tirado-González I. Warren J. Freitag N. Klapp B.F. Rifkin D. Fuss I. Strober W. Dveksler G.S. Pregnancy-specific glycoprotein 1 (PSG1) activates TGF-β and prevents dextran sodium sulfate (DSS)-induced colitis in mice.Mucosal Immunol. 2014; 7: 348-358Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). Recombinant proteins generated by transient transfection were purified from cell culture medium (Opti-MEM I) of CHO-K1 cells transfected with Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen) 72 h post-transfection. The protein consisting of the Fc tag (used as control for the treatment of macrophages) was generated by transient transfection of CHO-K1 cells with the pFUSE-hIgG1-Fc2 vector (InvivoGen). The four mutant N-terminal domain proteins were obtained by replacing the wild-type sequence in the cDNA encoding the leader peptide and the N-terminal domain of PSG1 cloned into the pFUSE-IgG1-e3-Fc1 vector with a synthesized cDNA fragment encoding the indicated mutations at the unique EcoRI-XhoI sites. For the generation of the recombinant B2 protein in bacteria, the B2 domain of PSG1 was PCR-amplified with primers 5′-GACGACGACAAGATGGGTCCAGACCTCCCCAG and 5′-GAGGAGAAGCCCGGTTAAGAGACTTCGACTGTCATG using the B2 domain cloned into pFUSE-IgG1-e3-Fc1 as the template. The PCR product was cloned into the pET-41 Ek/LIC vector (Novagen, Billerica, MA). The proper insert orientation and sequence were confirmed by sequencing with the S-tag primer as recommended by the manufacturer. Expression of the B2 cDNA cloned into the pET-41 Ek/LIC vector in Rosetta-gami 2(DE3) bacteria renders a polypeptide containing GST, His, and S-tag at the N terminus, and its expression was induced by addition of 1 mm isopropyl β-d-thiogalactopyranoside for 2 h. Following induction, the soluble and insoluble fractions were analyzed for the presence of the protein (designated as PSG1-GST-B2) by separation on a 4–12% NuPAGE Bis-Tris gel (Invitrogen), followed by staining of the gel with GelCode Blue (Thermo Scientific, Waltham, MA). The PSG1-GST-B2 protein, which had a predicted molecular mass of 40 kDa, was present in the insoluble fraction, and its identity was confirmed by immunoblot analysis with anti-PSG1 B2 peptide polyclonal antibody NBP1-58028 (Novus Biologicals, Littleton, CO), followed by HRP-conjugated goat anti-rabbit antibody. To generate purified PSG1-GST-B2 protein, Rosetta-gami 2(DE3) cells expressing PSG1-GST-B2 were disrupted using lysozyme (1 kilo-unit/ml) and Benzonase (25 units/ml) in BugBuster protein extraction reagent (Novagen) with cOmplete EDTA-free protease inhibitor mixture (Roche Applied Science), and the insoluble fraction was recovered by centrifugation, followed by several washes with BugBuster as suggested by the manufacturer. The bacterial pellet (containing the inclusion bodies) was solubilized in binding buffer (6 m guanidine HCl, 20 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.0), 500 mm NaCl, and 5 mm imidazole), and the protein was purified following the HisTrap on-column refolding protocol (GE Healthcare). Recombinant GST (GenScript USA Inc.) was used as the control protein in experiments testing PSG1-GST-B2 activation of SLC. All recombinant proteins generated for the studies described in this work were purified with the indicated column: protein A for Fc-tagged proteins and HisTrap for the bacterially produced B2 domain in an ÄKTAprime system (GE Healthcare) unless specified otherwise. Elution fractions containing the protein were pooled, concentrated, and buffer-exchanged with PBS in an Amicon Ultra-10K centrifugal filter unit (Millipore). For quantitation purposes, the purified proteins were separated on 4–20% NuPAGE Bis-Tris gels at different dilutions alongside known concentrations of BSA (Thermo Scientific), used as a standard. After staining with GelCode Blue, the proteins were quantitated by densitometry. Antibodies to the specific domains, including monoclonal antibody 4 (which reacts with the N-terminal domain), monoclonal antibody BAP1 (Aldevron Freiburg GmbH, Freiburg, Germany; which reacts with the A2 domain), and anti-B2 peptide polyclonal antibody, were used to confirm the identity of the single-domain mutants by Western blotting (data not shown). Protein-protein interactions were analyzed by the SPR technique using a Biacore 3000 instrument (GE Healthcare). Recombinant human LAP and human latent TGF-β1 (catalog numbers 246-LP (carrier-free) and 299-LT, respectively; R&D Systems, Minneapolis, MN), were coupled via a standard amine-coupling procedure to the flow cells of a CM5 sensor chip until a level of 1000 resonance units was reached. A control cell was prepared in the same way but without protein. Tested proteins were injected separately into the flow cell at a flow rate of 10 μl/min at 25 °C. Each interaction was analyzed at least three times with different protein preparations. Several analyte concentrations (8, 6, 5, 4, 2, 1, and 0.5 μm) were injected during the association phase for 3 min with HBS-EP (0.01 m HEPES (pH 7.4), 0.15 m NaCl, 3 mm EDTA, and 0.005% (v/v) Surfactant P20) as the running buffer. The dissociation phase, initiated by passage of HBS-EP buffer alone, was carried out over a period of 2 min. The chip surfaces were regenerated by a 60-s injection of 10 mm glycine HCl (pH 2.0). Kinetic data were analyzed using BIAevaluation version 4.1.1. The association (Ka) and dissociation (Kd) constants were calculated assuming a 1:1 Langmuir binding model. All binding curves were corrected for background and bulk refractive index contribution by subtraction of the reference flow cells. For LSKL peptide inhibition studies, 2 μm PSG1-Fc was incubated with the LSKL peptide (GenScript USA Inc.) or a control peptide (SLLK) at 20 and 200 μm final concentrations for 1 h at 37 °C before injection at 10 μl/min over a biosensor chip with immobilized LAP. LAP was coupled via a standard amine-coupling procedure to the flow cell of a CM5 sensor chip until a level of 2000 resonance units was reached. A reference cell was prepared in the same way but without protein. The association and dissociation phases were perform as described above. The percentages of PSG1-Fc-LAP binding in the presence of the LSKL or SLLK peptide were calculated in comparison with PSG1-LAP binding in the absence of peptide (100%). Each interaction was analyzed at least three times, and all binding curves were corrected for background and bulk refractive index contribution by subtraction of the reference flow cell. Active TGF-β1 was detected as described previously (15.Blois S.M. Sulkowski G. Tirado-González I. Warren J. Freitag N. Klapp B.F. Rifkin D. Fuss I. Strober W. Dveksler G.S. Pregnancy-specific glycoprotein 1 (PSG1) activates TGF-β and prevents dextran sodium sulfate (DSS)-induced colitis in mice.Mucosal Immunol. 2014; 7: 348-358Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). Briefly, 50 ng/ml SLC (R&D Systems) was incubated with PSG1-A2-Fc, PSG1-N-Fc, PSG1-B2-Fc, PSG1-GST-B2, CEACAM9-Fc, or GST at the concentrations indicated in the figure legends (0.25–10.0 μg/ml) at 37 °C for 1 h in a final volume of 0.1 ml of PBS in siliconized tubes. The samples were transferred to a 96-well Nunc MaxiSorp plate that had been blocked with 0.5% BSA following an overnight coating step with either recombinant human TGF-β receptor II-Fc or anti-TGF-β1 antibody (R&D Systems). After 2 h, the plates were washed, and the presence of active TGF-β1 was detected with a biotinylated antibody specific for mature TGF-β1 from a DuoSet ELISA kit (R&D Systems). The presence of bioactive TGF-β was determined using the TGF-β-responsive plasminogen activator inhibitor-1 luciferase reporter mink lung epithelial cell (MLEC) line provided by Dr. D. Rifkin (New York University, New York, NY) as described previously (20.Abe M. Harpel J.G. Metz C.N. Nunes I. Loskutoff D.J. Rifkin D.B. An assay for transforming growth factor-β using cells transfected with a plasminogen activator inhibitor-1 promoter-luciferase construct.Anal. Biochem. 1994; 216: 276-284Crossref PubMed Scopus (677) Google Scholar). In brief, 1.6 × 104 MLECs were seeded onto a 96-well plate in serum-free DMEM supplemented with 0.1% insulin/transferrin/sodium selenite medium (Sigma-Aldrich). After 3 h, the MLECs were treated either with DMEM and 0.1% insulin/transferrin/sodium selenite medium or with 2.5 μg/ml PSG1-A2-Fc, PSG1-N-Fc, PSG1-GST-B2, GST, or CEACAM9-Fc that had been incubated at 37 °C for 1 h with or without 50 ng/ml SLC. After 16 h, the cells were rinsed with PBS and lysed with Passive Lysis Buffer (Promega, Madison, WI), and the lysate was analyzed on a GloMax luminometer (Promega) following addition of the luciferase substrate and reported as relative light units. Similarly, for LSKL peptide inhibition studies, 50 ng/ml SLC was incubated at 37 °C for 1 h with PSG1-GST-B2 in the presence of a 10-fold molar excess of LSKL or SKKL peptide (4.4 nm) and added to MLECs in triplicate as described above. The increase in luciferase was compared with PSG1-GST-B2- and GST control-treated samples as a measure of active TGF-β1. RAW264.7 macrophages were plated at a density of 1.8 × 105 cells/well of a 96-well plate in triplicate in DMEM and 5% HyClone FetalClone III (GE Healthcare). After overnight incubation at 37 °C, the medium was replaced with medium containing the proteins at the indicated concentrations, and the supernatants were collected after 16–22 h. Supernatant (0.1 ml) was activated with 1 n HCl, followed by neutralization to measure total TGF-β1 by ELISA following the manufacturer's recommendations (R&D Systems). All treatments were performed in triplicate in at least three independent experiments. Total RNA was isolated from RAW264.7 cells with an RNeasy mini kit (Qiagen). RNA (1 μg) was used to generate cDNA with a high capacity cDNA reverse transcription kit (Applied Biosystems). The TGF-β1 mRNA levels were determined with the following primer-probe sets (Invitrogen): for TGF-β1, assay ID MM01178820_M1, and for the hypoxanthine phosphoribosyltransferase (HPRT) housekeeping gene, assay ID MM00446968_M1 using TaqMan Gene Expression Master Mix in a 20-μl final reaction volume as recommended by the manufacturer. The Ct values of TGF-β1 were normalized to those of hypoxanthine phosphoribosyltransferase, and the experiment was repeated three independent times using three wells per treatment. All cells were cultured in 5% CO2 and 95% air in 37 °C humidified incubators in the presence of 100 units/ml penicillin/streptomycin (Invitrogen) and 1× Normocin (InvivoGen). RAW264.7 cells were obtained from the American Type Culture Collection (Manassas, VA) and cultured in the medium and conditions recommended. Regular FBS was replaced with HyClone FetalClone III, which has very low levels of TGF-β1, in experiments designed to test the ability of different proteins to induce TGF-β1 secretion from RAW264.7 cells. A structural model of the N-terminal domain of human PSG1 was generated using SWISS-MODEL with the crystal structure of the N-terminal domain of CEACAM5 as a reference (Protein Data Bank ID 2QSQ) (21,22). The model was refined using 3Drefine and evaluated with PROCHECK (23.Laskowski R.A. MacArthur M.W. Moss D.S. Thornton J.M. PROCHECK: a program to check the stereochemical quality of protein structures.J. Appl. Crystallogr. 1993; 26: 283-291Crossref Google Scholar). The final model had 98.9% of the residues in the most favorable or additionally allowed regions (24.Bhattacharya D. Cheng J. 3Drefine: consistent protein structure refinement by optimizing hydrogen bonding network and atomic-level energy minimization.Proteins. 2013; 81: 119-131Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar). The root mean square deviation between the model and the CEACAM5 crystal structure was 0.2 Å for 107 residues. Statistical significance of raw data between two groups was evaluated using Student's unpaired t test. Results are expressed as the mean ± S.D. Statistical analysis was performed using GraphPad Prism software. We showed previously that full-length PSG1 purified from the serum of pregnant women and a natural splice variant composed of three domains (N-terminal, A2, and B2) with an Fc tag at the C terminus, designated PSG1-Fc, activate latent TGF-β1 (15.Blois S.M.

The best characterized activators of TGF-β1, including selected integrins and TSP-1, bind to LAP of TGF-β1 in the absence of the mature TGF-β1 polypeptide (25.Annes J.P. Chen Y. Munger J.S.

Chem. 1999; 274: 13586-13593Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (301) Google Scholar). Here, we analyzed whether PSG1 can bind to LAP in the absence of the mature TGF-β1 polypeptide and defined the kinetics of the interactions between PSG1 and LAP and between PSG1 and SLC of TGF-β1 using SPR analysis. For these experiments, we used PSG1-Fc, which is the protein we previously used for our in vivo studies, and PSG1-His, which is composed of the four PSG1 domains (N-terminal, A1, A2, and B2) (Fig. 1B). The SPR experiments revealed a direct interaction between PSG1 and LAP in the absence and presence of the mature TGF-β1 polypeptide (Fig. 2). The affinity of the PSG1-LAP interaction is in the micromolar range (Kd = 1.09–3.56 μm). Kinetic parameters of these interactions were calculated and are shown in Table 1. To determine which domain(s) of PSG1-Fc are involved in TGF-β1 binding, we generated PSG1 single-domain constructs (Fig. 1). Binding of the PSG1 single-domain proteins to SLC and LAP was also analyzed by SPR (Fig. 3). Proteins consisting of only the N-terminal or A2 domain did not bind to SLC or LAP more than the control protein CEACAM9-Fc. Interestingly, the B2 domain alone showed binding to SLC and LAP, revealing a direct interaction bet"
https://openalex.org/W2054422197,"Spasticity obstructs motor function recovery post-stroke, and has been reported to occur in spinal cord injury and electrophysiological studies. The purpose of the present study was to assess spinal cord circuit spasticity in post-stroke mice. At 3, 7, 21, and 42 d after photothrombotic ischemic cortical injury in C57BL/6J mice, we observed decreased rate-dependent depression (RDD) of the Hoffmann reflex (H reflex) in the affected forelimb of mice compared with the limbs of sham mice and the non-affected forelimb. This finding suggests a hyper-excitable stretch reflex in the affected forelimb. We then performed immunohistochemical and western blot analyses to examine the expression of the potassium-chloride cotransporter 2 (KCC2) and phosphorylation of the KCC2 serine residue, 940 (S940), since this is the main chloride extruder that affects neuronal excitability. We also performed immunohistochemical analyses on the number of vesicular glutamate transporter 1 (vGluT1)-positive boutons to count the number of Ia afferent fibers that connect to motoneurons. Western bolts revealed that, compared with sham mice, experimental mice had significantly reduced KCC2 expression at 7 d post-stroke, and dephosphorylated S940 at 3 and 7 d post-stroke in motoneuron plasma membranes. We also observed a lower density of KCC2-positive areas in the plasma membrane of motoneurons at 3 and 7 d post-stroke. However, western blot and immunohistochemical analyses revealed that there were no differences between groups 21 and 42 d post-stroke, respectively. In addition, at 7 and 42 d post-stroke, experimental mice exhibited a significant increase in vGluT1 boutons compared with sham mice. Our findings suggest that both the down-regulation of KCC2 and increases in Ia afferent fibers are involved in post-stroke spasticity."

To date, topical application of mAbs in humans and their stability in vaginal secretions has not been studied.To assess the pharmacokinetics and safety of the mAbs 2F5, 4E10 and 2G12 when applied vaginally in women.A randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled phase 1 trial.Twenty-eight healthy, sexually abstinent women administered 2.5 g of gel daily for 12 days containing either 10 or 20 mg/g of each mAb (MABGEL) or placebo. Main clinical evaluations and sampling occurred at baseline, 1, 8, and 24 hours post-1st dose and 12 and 36 hours post-12th dose.After adjustment for dilution factors, median levels of 2F5, 4E10 and 2G12 in vaginal secretions at 1 hour post high-dose MABGEL were 7.74, 5.28 and 7.48 mg/ml respectively. Levels of 2F5 and 4E10 declined exponentially thereafter with similar estimated half-lives (4.6 and 4.3 hours). In contrast, 2G12 levels declined more rapidly in the first 8 hours, with an estimated half-life of 1.4 hours during this period. There was no evidence of systemic absorption. There were no significant differences in local or systemic adverse event rates or vaginal flora changes (by qPCR) between active and placebo gel arms. Whilst at least 1 adverse event was recorded in 96% of participants, 95% were mild and none were serious.Vaginal application of 50 mg of each mAb daily was safe over a 12 day period. Median mAb concentrations detected at 8 hours post dose were potentially sufficient to block HIV transmission.2G12 exhibited more rapid elimination from the human vagina than 4E10 and 2F5, likely due to poor stability of 2G12 in acidic human vaginal secretions. Further research is needed to develop mAb-based vaginal microbicides and delivery systems.ISRCTN 64808733 UK CRN Portfolio 6470."
https://openalex.org/W2092291054,"Establishing an effective method to improve stem cell differentiation is crucial in stem cell transplantation. Here we aimed to explore whether and how sodium butyrate (NaB) induces rat bone marrow mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) to differentiate into bladder smooth muscle cells (SMCs). We found that NaB significantly suppressed MSC proliferation and promoted MSCs differentiation into SMCs, as evidenced by the enhanced expression of SMC specific genes in the MSCs. Co-culturing the MSCs with SMCs in a transwell system promoted the differentiation of MSCs into SMCs. NaB again promoted MSC differentiation in this system. Furthermore, NaB enhanced the acetylation of SMC gene-associated H3K9 and H4, and decreased the expression of HDAC2 and down-regulated the recruitment of HDAC2 to the promoter regions of SMC specific genes. Finally, we found that NaB significantly promoted MSC depolarization and increased the intracellular calcium level of MSCs upon carbachol stimulation. These results demonstrated that NaB effectively promotes MSC differentiation into SMCs, possibly by the marked inhibition of HDAC2 expression and disassociation of HDAC2 recruitment to SMC specific genes in MSCs, which further induces high levels of H3K9ace and H4ace and the enhanced expression of target genes, and this strategy could potentially be applied in clinical tissue engineering and cell transplantation."
https://openalex.org/W2102398739,"Molecular signatures in Glioblastoma (GBM) have been described that correlate with clinical outcome and response to therapy. The Proneural (PN) and Mesenchymal (MES) signatures have been identified most consistently, but others including Classical (CLAS) have also been reported. The molecular signatures have been detected by array techniques at RNA and DNA level, but these methods are costly and cannot take into account individual contributions of different cells within a tumor. Therefore, the aim of this study was to investigate whether subclasses of newly diagnosed GBMs could be assessed and assigned by application of standard pathology laboratory procedures. 123 newly diagnosed GBMs were analyzed for the tumor cell expression of 23 pre-identified proteins and EGFR amplification, together allowing for the subclassification of 65% of the tumors. Immunohistochemistry (IHC)-based profiling was found to be analogous to transcription-based profiling using a 9-gene transcriptional signature for PN and MES subclasses. Based on these data a novel, minimal IHC-based scheme for subclass assignment for GBMs is proposed. Positive staining for IDH1R132H can be used for PN subclass assignment, high EGFR expression for the CLAS subtype and a combined high expression of PTEN, VIM and/or YKL40 for the MES subclass. The application of the proposed scheme was evaluated in an independent tumor set, which resulted in similar subclass assignment rates as those observed in the training set. The IHC-based subclassification scheme proposed in this study therefore could provide very useful in future studies for stratification of individual patient samples."
https://openalex.org/W1986872439,"Introduction Linkage of HIV-infected pregnant women to HIV care remains critical for improvement of maternal and child outcomes through prevention of maternal-to-child transmission of HIV (PMTCT) and subsequent chronic HIV care. This study determined proportions and factors associated with intra-facility linkage to HIV care and Early Infant Diagnosis care (EID) to inform strategic scale up of PMTCT programs. Methods A cross-sectional review of records was done at 2 urban and 3 rural public health care facilities supported by the Infectious Diseases Institute (IDI). HIV-infected pregnant mothers, identified through routine antenatal care (ANC) and HIV-exposed babies were evaluated for enrollment in HIV clinics by 6 weeks post-delivery. Results Overall, 1,025 HIV-infected pregnant mothers were identified during ANC between January and June, 2012; 267/1,025 (26%) in rural and 743/1,025 (74%) in urban facilities. Of these 375/1,025 (37%) were linked to HIV clinics [67/267(25%) rural and 308/758(41%) urban]. Of 636 HIV-exposed babies, 193 (30%) were linked to EID. Linkage of mother-baby pairs to HIV chronic care and EID was 16% (101/636); 8/179 (4.5%)] in rural and 93/457(20.3%) in urban health facilities. Within rural facilities, ANC registration <28 weeks-of-gestation was associated with mothers' linkage to HIV chronic care [AoR, 2.0 95% CI, 1.1–3.7, p = 0.019] and mothers' multi-parity was associated with baby's linkage to EID; AoR 4.4 (1.3–15.1), p = 0.023. Stigma, long distance to health facilities and vertical PMTCT services affected linkage in rural facilities, while peer mothers, infant feeding services, long patient queues and limited privacy hindered linkage to HIV care in urban settings. Conclusion Post-natal linkage of HIV-infected mothers to chronic HIV care and HIV-exposed babies to EID programs was low. Barriers to linkage to HIV care vary in urban and rural settings. We recommend targeted interventions to rapidly improve linkage to antiretroviral therapy for elimination of MTCT."
https://openalex.org/W1988816367,"The choroidal circulation plays a central role in maintaining the health of outer retina and photoreceptor function. Alterations in this circulation contribute to pathogenesis of many eye diseases including exudative age-related macular degeneration. Unfortunately, very little is known about the choroidal circulation and its molecular and cellular regulation. This has been further hampered by the lack of methods for routine culturing of choroidal endothelial cells (ChEC), especially from wild type and transgenic mice. Here we describe a method for isolation and culturing of mouse ChEC. We show that expression of thrombospondin-1 (TSP1), an endogenous inhibitor of angiogenesis and inflammation, has a significant impact on phenotype of ChEC. ChEC from TSP1-deficient (TSP1−/−) mice were less proliferative and more apoptotic, less migratory and less adherent, and failed to undergo capillary morphogenesis in Matrigel. However, re-expression of TSP1 was sufficient to restore TSP1−/− ChEC migration and capillary morphogenesis. TSP1−/− ChEC expressed increased levels of TSP2, phosphorylated endothelial nitric oxide synthase (NOS) and inducible NOS (iNOS), a marker of inflammation, which was associated with significantly higher level of NO and oxidative stress in these cells. Wild type and TSP1−/− ChEC produced similar levels of VEGF, although TSP1−/− ChEC exhibited increased levels of VEGF-R1 and pSTAT3. Other signaling pathways including Src, Akt, and MAPKs were not dramatically affected by the lack of TSP1. Together our results demonstrate an important autocrine role for TSP1 in regulation of ChEC phenotype."

We describe here for the first time that p38α, p38γ, and p38δ down-regulate fibulin 3 expression. p38α has a stronger effect, and it does so through hypermethylation of CpG sites in the regulatory sequences of the gene. This would be mediated by the DNA methylase, DNMT3A, which is down-regulated in cells lacking p38α, but once re-introduced represses Fibulin 3 expression. p38α through HuR stabilizes dnmt3a mRNA leading to an increase in DNMT3A protein levels. Moreover, by knocking-down fibulin 3, we have found that Fibulin 3 inhibits migration and invasion in MEFs by mechanisms involving p38α/β inhibition. Hence, p38α pro-migratory/invasive effect might be, at least in part, mediated by fibulin 3 down-regulation in MEFs. In contrast, in HCT116 cells, Fibulin 3 promotes migration and invasion through a mechanism dependent on p38α and/or p38β activation. Furthermore, Fibulin 3 promotes in vitro and in vivo tumor growth of HCT116 cells through a mechanism dependent on p38α, which surprisingly acts as a potent inducer of tumor growth.

Despite the uncertainties of the risks involved, some Muslim patients undergoing chronic haemodialysis choose to observe intermittent fasting during the month of Ramadan. This study aims to investigate the effect of Ramadan fasting in haemodialysis patients residing in a tropical climate country. Methods This prospective cross sectional study recruited Muslim patients on regular haemodialysis from three haemodialysis centres in Kuala Lumpur from 15th July 2011 to 29th August 2011. Patients who fasted for any number of days were included (n = 35, 54% female, age 54±11 years). 89% of patients fasted for more than 15 days and 49% were diabetics. Dialysis parameters and blood samples were obtained one week prior to Ramadan and during the last week of Ramadan. The differences in dialysis parameters and biochemical values pre- and end-Ramadan were examined using paired t-test. Results Both pre- and post-dialysis weight were significantly decreased during Ramadan fasting compared to the month prior (p = <0.001). There was a significant decrease in the amount of ultrafiltration (p = 0.002). There were no significant differences in dry weight, inter-dialytic weight gain, mean urea reduction ratio or blood pressure measurements comparing pre- and end of Ramadan fasting. There was a significant increase in serum albumin level (p = 0.006) and decrease in serum phosphate level (p = 0.02) at the end of Ramadan. Conclusion Ramadan fasting is associated with reduced weight, improved serum albumin and phosphate level in our population of haemodialysis patients. A larger multi-centre study will allow us to understand more about the effects of fasting in this population."

Here, we extracted two lignin-containing carbohydrates, lignin-rich enzyme lignin (LREL) and pure enzyme lignin (PEL), from barley husk and demonstrated that they act as immune stimulators of dendritic cells (DCs), which are particularly important in linking innate and adaptive immunity. Thioacidolysis, acid hydrolysis, and mild alkali hydrolysis of both LREL and PEL revealed that their immunostimulatory activities depended on the lignin structure and/or content, neutral sugar content (especially the characteristic distribution of galactose and mannose), and presence of an ester bond. Furthermore, we showed that the immunostimulatory potency of the lignin-carbohydrate depended on its molecular weight and degree of polymerization. We also demonstrated that the LREL-induced activation of DCs was mediated via TLR4. Thus, LREL-induced increases in the expression levels of several cell surface marker proteins, production of inflammatory cytokines IL-12p40 and TNF-α, and activation and nuclear translocation of transcription factors, as was observed in the WT DCs, were completely abrogated in DCs derived from the TLR4−/− mice but not in DCs derived from the TLR2−/−, TLR7−/−, and TLR9−/− mice.

Methods We randomly divided 30 rats into a control group (CG), a normal temperature (25±2°C, 60%±5% humidity) exercise group (NTEG) and a high temperature and high humidity (35±2°C, 80%±10% humidity) exercising group (HTEG), each comprising 10 animals. The NTEG and HTEG rats were forced to run in a treadmill for 1 hour maximum at 20 rpm. We analyzed liver cells of all three groups with JC-1 dye and flow cytometry for apoptosis rates in addition to liver tissue 8 - hydroxy deoxyguanosine (8 - OhdG) and blood serum IL–6, tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-α), alanine aminotransferase ALT, aspartate amino transferase (AST), serum creatinine (CREA), blood urea nitrogen (BUN), lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), creatine phosphate kinase (CK) concentrations. Result Compared with NTEG rats, beside reduced exercise tolerance (60±5 vs. 15±3 minutes) (p = 0.002) the 8-OhdG liver tissue concentrations were significantly higher (p = 0.040) in the HTEG rats. The HTEG developed more organ tissue damage and cellular fragmentations of liver cells. In both exercise groups TNF-α and IL-6 serum concentrations were enhanced significantly (p<0.001) being highest in the HTEG animals. Serum ALT, AST, LDH, CREA, BUN and CK concentrations were significantly enhance in both exercise groups. Conclusion In our exertional heat stroke rat model, we found tissue damage particularly in livers during exercises in hot and humid environment that was related to inflammation, oxidative stress and apoptosis."
https://openalex.org/W2069993585,"Insulin is known to induce hepatocyte swelling, which triggers via integrins and c-Src kinase an activation of the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) and subsequent cell proliferation (1). Free fatty acids (FFAs) are known to induce lipoapoptosis in liver cells in a c-Jun-NH2-terminal kinase (JNK)-dependent, but death receptor-independent way (2). As non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) is associated with hyperinsulinemia and increased FFA-blood levels, the interplay between insulin and FFA was studied with regard to hepatocyte proliferation and apoptosis in isolated rat and mouse hepatocytes. Saturated long chain FFAs induced apoptosis and JNK activation in primary rat hepatocytes, but did not activate the CD95 (Fas, APO-1) system, whereas insulin triggered EGFR activation and hepatocyte proliferation. Coadministration of insulin and FFAs, however, abolished hepatocyte proliferation and triggered CD95-dependent apoptosis due to a JNK-dependent association of the activated EGFR with CD95, subsequent CD95 tyrosine phosphorylation and formation of the death-inducing signaling complex (DISC). JNK inhibition restored the proliferative insulin effect in presence of FFAs and prevented EGFR/CD95 association, CD95 tyrosine phosphorylation and DISC formation. Likewise, in presence of FFAs insulin increased apoptosis in hepatocytes from wild type but not from Alb-Cre-FASfl/fl mice, which lack functional CD95. It is concluded that FFAs can shift insulin-induced hepatocyte proliferation toward hepatocyte apoptosis by triggering a JNK signal, which allows activated EGFR to associate with CD95 and to trigger CD95-dependent apoptosis. Such phenomena may contribute to the pathogenesis of NASH."
https://openalex.org/W2056817304,"Background Intratumoral heterogeneity may help drive resistance to targeted therapies in cancer. In breast cancer, the presence of nodal metastases is a key indicator of poorer overall survival. The aim of this study was to identify somatic genetic alterations in early dissemination of breast cancer by whole genome next generation sequencing (NGS) of a primary breast tumor, a matched locally-involved axillary lymph node and healthy normal DNA from blood. Methods Whole genome NGS was performed on 12 µg (range 11.1–13.3 µg) of DNA isolated from fresh-frozen primary breast tumor, axillary lymph node and peripheral blood following the DNA nanoball sequencing protocol. Single nucleotide variants, insertions, deletions, and substitutions were identified through a bioinformatic pipeline and compared to CIN25, a key set of genes associated with tumor metastasis. Results Whole genome sequencing revealed overlapping variants between the tumor and node, but also variants that were unique to each. Novel mutations unique to the node included those found in two CIN25 targets, TGIF2 and CCNB2, which are related to transcription cyclin activity and chromosomal stability, respectively, and a unique frameshift in PDS5B, which is required for accurate sister chromatid segregation during cell division. We also identified dominant clonal variants that progressed from tumor to node, including SNVs in TP53 and ARAP3, which mediates rearrangements to the cytoskeleton and cell shape, and an insertion in TOP2A, the expression of which is significantly associated with tumor proliferation and can segregate breast cancers by outcome. Conclusion This case study provides preliminary evidence that primary tumor and early nodal metastasis have largely overlapping somatic genetic alterations. There were very few mutations unique to the involved node. However, significant conclusions regarding early dissemination needs analysis of a larger number of patient samples."
https://openalex.org/W2021673219,"Connexins, the constituent proteins of gap junctions, are transmembrane proteins. A connexin (Cx) traverses the membrane four times and has one intracellular and two extracellular loops with the amino and carboxyl termini facing the cytoplasm. The transmembrane and the extracellular loop domains are highly conserved among different Cxs, whereas the carboxyl termini, often called the cytoplasmic tails, are highly divergent. We have explored the role of the cytoplasmic tail of Cx32, a Cx expressed in polarized and differentiated cells, in regulating gap junction assembly. Our results demonstrate that compared with the full-length Cx32, the cytoplasmic tail-deleted Cx32 is assembled into small gap junctions in human pancreatic and prostatic cancer cells. Our results further document that the expression of the full-length Cx32 in cells, which express the tail-deleted Cx32, increases the size of gap junctions, whereas the expression of the tail-deleted Cx32 in cells, which express the full-length Cx32, has the opposite effect. Moreover, we show that the tail is required for the clustering of cell-cell channels and that in cells expressing the tail-deleted Cx32, the expression of cell surface-targeted cytoplasmic tail alone is sufficient to enhance the size of gap junctions. Our live-cell imaging data further demonstrate that gap junctions formed of the tail-deleted Cx32 are highly mobile compared with those formed of full-length Cx32. Our results suggest that the cytoplasmic tail of Cx32 is not required to initiate the assembly of gap junctions but for their subsequent growth and stability. Our findings suggest that the cytoplasmic tail of Cx32 may be involved in regulating the permeability of gap junctions by regulating their size."
https://openalex.org/W2046701333,"iRhom1 and iRhom2 are inactive homologues of rhomboid intramembrane serine proteases lacking essential catalytic residues, which are necessary for the maturation of TNFα-converting enzyme (TACE). In addition, iRhoms regulate epidermal growth factor family secretion. The functional significance of iRhom2 during mammalian development is largely unclear. We have identified a spontaneous single gene deletion mutation of iRhom2 in Uncv mice. The iRhom2Uncv/Uncv mice exhibit hairless phenotype in a BALB/c genetic background. In this study, we observed dysplasia hair follicles in iRhom2Uncv/Uncv mice from postnatal day 3. Further examination found decreased hair matrix proliferation and aberrant hair shaft and inner root sheath differentiation in iRhom2Uncv/Uncv mutant hair follicles. iRhom2 is required for the maturation of TACE. Our data demonstrate that iRhom2Uncv cannot induce the maturation of TACE in vitro and the level of mature TACE is also significantly reduced in the skin of iRhom2Uncv/Uncv mice. The activation of Notch1, a substrate of TACE, is disturbed, associated with dramatically down-regulation of Lef1 in iRhom2Uncv/Uncv hair follicle matrix. This study identifies iRhom2 as a novel regulator of hair shaft and inner root sheath differentiation."
https://openalex.org/W2010504934,"Central hypovolemia elevates hemostatic activity which is essential for preventing exsanguination after trauma, but platelet activation to central hypovolemia has not been described. We hypothesized that central hypovolemia induced by lower body negative pressure (LBNP) activates platelets. Eight healthy subjects were exposed to progressive central hypovolemia by LBNP until presyncope. At baseline and 5 min after presyncope, hemostatic activity of venous blood was evaluated by flow cytometry, thrombelastography, and plasma markers of coagulation and fibrinolysis. Cell counts were also determined. Flow cytometry revealed that LBNP increased mean fluorescence intensity of PAC-1 by 1959±455 units (P<0.001) and percent of fluorescence-positive platelets by 27±18%-points (P = 0.013). Thrombelastography demonstrated that coagulation was accelerated (R-time decreased by 0.8±0.4 min (P = 0.001)) and that clot lysis increased (LY60 by 6.0±5.8%-points (P = 0.034)). Plasma coagulation factor VIII and von Willebrand factor ristocetin cofactor activity increased (P = 0.011 and P = 0.024, respectively), demonstrating increased coagulation activity, while von Willebrand factor antigen was unchanged. Plasma protein C activity and tissue-type plasminogen activator increased (P = 0.007 and P = 0.017, respectively), and D-dimer increased by 0.03±0.02 mg l−1 (P = 0.031), demonstrating increased fibrinolytic activity. Plasma prothrombin time and activated partial thromboplastin time were unchanged. Platelet count increased by 15±13% (P = 0.014) and red blood cells by 9±4% (P = 0.002). In humans, LBNP-induced presyncope activates platelets, as evidenced by increased exposure of active glycoprotein IIb/IIIa, accelerates coagulation. LBNP activates fibrinolysis, similar to hemorrhage, but does not alter coagulation screening tests, such as prothrombin time and activated partial thromboplastin time. LBNP results in increased platelet counts, but also in hemoconcentration."
https://openalex.org/W2026535711,"In this study, we conducted a meta-analysis on high-throughput gene expression data to identify TNF-α-mediated genes implicated in lung cancer. We first investigated the gene expression profiles of two independent TNF-α/TNFR KO murine models. The EGF receptor signaling pathway was the top pathway associated with genes mediated by TNF-α. After matching the TNF-α-mediated mouse genes to their human orthologs, we compared the expression patterns of the TNF-α-mediated genes in normal and tumor lung tissues obtained from humans. Based on the TNF-α-mediated genes that were dysregulated in lung tumors, we developed a prognostic gene signature that effectively predicted recurrence-free survival in lung cancer in two validation cohorts. Resampling tests suggested that the prognostic power of the gene signature was not by chance, and multivariate analysis suggested that this gene signature was independent of the traditional clinical factors and enhanced the identification of lung cancer patients at greater risk for recurrence."
https://openalex.org/W2052435715,"Maternal-fetal IgGs transport occurs either prenatally or postnatally, which confers the newborns with passive immunity before their own immune system has matured. However, little is known about the mechanisms of postnatal IgGs passage in the mammary gland. To investigate how FcRn mediates the IgGs transport in the mammary gland, we first generated bFcRn and anti-HAV mAb transgenic mice, and then obtained HF transgenic mice expressing both transgenes by mating the above two strains. Transgene expression of bFcRn in the four lines was determined by qRT-PCR and western blot. We then localized the expression of bFcRn to the acinar epithelial cells in the mammary gland, and anti-HAV mAb was mainly detected in the acini with weak staining in the acinar epithelial cells. Human IgGs could be detected in both milk and serum of HF transgenic mice by western blot and ELISA. A significantly lower milk to serum ratio of human IgGs in HF mice compared with that of anti-HAV mAb mice, indicating that bFcRn could transport human IgGs across the milk-blood barrier from milk to serum during lactation in HF mice. While, there were no transport of murine IgGs, IgAs, or IgMs. These results provide understandings about the mechanisms of maternal-fetal immunity transfer in the mammary gland."
https://openalex.org/W2321429082,"Objective Plasma apolipoprotein (apo)D, a ubiquitously expressed protein that binds small hydrophobic ligands, is found mainly on HDL particles. According to studies of human genetics and lipid disorders, plasma apoD levels positively correlate with HDL-cholesterol and apoAI levels. Thus, we tested the hypothesis that apoD was a regulator of HDL metabolism. Methods & Results We compared the plasma lipid and lipoprotein profiles of wild-type (WT) C57BL/6 mice with apoD−/− mice on a C57BL/6 background after receiving a high fat-high cholesterol diet for 12 weeks. ApoD−/− mice had higher HDL-cholesterol levels (61±13-apoD−/− vs. 52±10-WT-males; 37±11-apoD−/− vs. 22±2 WT-female) than WT mice with sex-specific changes in total plasma levels of cholesterol and other lipids. Compared to WT, the HDL of apoD−/− mice showed an increase in large, lipid-rich HDL particles and according to size various quantities and sizes of LDL particles. Plasma levels of lecithin:cholesterol acyltransferase in the control and apoD−/− mice were not different, however, plasma phospholipid transfer protein activity was modestly elevated (+10%) only in male apoD−/− mice. An in vivo HDL metabolism experiment with isolated Western-fed apoD−/− HDL particles showed that female apoD−/− mice had a 36% decrease in the fractional catabolic rate of HDL cholesteryl ester. Hepatic SR-BI and LDLR protein levels were significantly decreased; accordingly, LDL-cholesterol and apoB levels were increased in female mice. Conclusion In the context of a high fat-high cholesterol diet, apoD deficiency in female mice is associated with increases in both plasma HDL and LDL-cholesterol levels, reflecting changes in expression of SR-BI and LDL receptors, which may impact diet-induced atherosclerosis."

https://openalex.org/W2156066790,"Traditionally, fMRI data are analyzed using statistical parametric mapping approaches. Regardless of the precise thresholding procedure, these approaches ultimately divide the brain in regions that do or do not differ significantly across experimental conditions. This binary classification scheme fosters the so-called imager's fallacy, where researchers prematurely conclude that region A is selectively involved in a certain cognitive task because activity in that region reaches statistical significance and activity in region B does not. For such a conclusion to be statistically valid, however, a test on the differences in activation across these two regions is required. Here we propose a simple GLM-based method that defines an ""in-between"" category of brain regions that are neither significantly active nor inactive, but rather ""in limbo"". For regions that are in limbo, the activation pattern is inconclusive: it does not differ significantly from baseline, but neither does it differ significantly from regions that do show significant changes from baseline. This pattern indicates that measurement was insufficiently precise. By directly testing differences in activation, our procedure helps reduce the impact of the imager's fallacy. The method is illustrated using concrete examples."
https://openalex.org/W1990312078,"Responses to height may range from indifference to minor distress to severe symptoms of fear of heights (acrophobia); visual height intolerance (vHI) denotes the whole spectrum of symptoms. Although there are options to manage vHI, only a small part of persons affected by vHI are willing to seek professional help or confront their problem. Purpose of this study was to determine if persons with vHI, specifically those who show avoidant behavior towards heights (avoiders), score lower in their general self-efficacy (GSE) than those who confront vHI (confronters).Cross-sectional survey in 607 individuals living in the urban region of Munich, Germany, using a mailed questionnaire on presence or absence of vHI, confronting or avoiding behaviour, and GSE.Of all participants (mean age 53.9, 50.3% female), 407 reported life-time presence of vHI. Participants with vHI had a mean GSE score of 31.8 (SD 4.3) points (participants without vHI: 32.5, SD 4.3, p = 0.008 for difference). Among individuals with vHI, 23% reported confronting behavior. Confronters were significantly younger (p<.0001, 50.2 vs. 55.7 years), more likely to be female (p = 0.0039, 64.3% female), and had a higher GSE score (p = 0.0049, 32.5 vs. 31.1). Associations remained significant after multiple adjustment.Our study provides evidence for the association of GSE and vHI. These findings may have consequences for strategies of alleviation and therapy of vHI."
https://openalex.org/W2044178516,"Oxygen sensor prolyl hydroxylases (PHDs) play important roles in the regulation of HIF-α and cell metabolisms. This study was designed to investigate the direct role of PHD2 in high fat-diet (HFD)-induced cardiac dysfunction. In HFD fed mice, PHD2 expression was increased without significant changes in PHD1 and PHD3 levels in the heart. This was accompanied by a significant upregulation of myeloid differentiation factor 88 (MYD88) and NF-κB. To explore the role of PHD2 in HFD-induced cardiac dysfunction, PHD2 conditional knockout mice were fed a HFD for 16 weeks. Intriguingly, knockout of PHD2 significantly reduced MYD88 and NF-κb expression in HFD mouse hearts. Moreover, knockout of PHD2 inhibited TNFα and ICAM-1 expression, and reduced cell apoptosis and macrophage infiltration in HFD mice. This was accompanied by a significant improvement of cardiac function. Most importantly, conditional knockout of PHD2 at late stage in HFD mice significantly improved glucose tolerance and reversed cardiac dysfunction. Our studies demonstrate that PHD2 activity is a critical contributor to the HFD-induced cardiac dysfunction. Inhibition of PHD2 attenuates HFD-induced cardiac dysfunction by a mechanism involving suppression of MYD88/NF-κb pathway and inflammation."
https://openalex.org/W1981672525,"Transcription factors SOX9, SOX5 and SOX6 are indispensable for generation and differentiation of chondrocytes. However, molecular mechanisms to induce the SOX genes are poorly understood. To address this issue, we previously determined the human embryonic enhancer of SOX6 by 5'RACE analysis, and identified the 46-bp core enhancer region (CES6). We initially performed yeast one-hybrid assay for screening other chondrogenic factors using CES6 as bait, and identified a zinc finger protein ZNF449. ZNF449 and Zfp449, a counterpart in mouse, transactivated enhancers or promoters of SOX6, SOX9 and COL2A1. Zfp449 was expressed in mesenchyme-derived tissues including cartilage, calvaria, muscle and tendon, as well as in other tissues including brain, lung and kidney. In limb cartilage of mouse embryo, Zfp449 protein was abundantly located in periarticular chondrocytes, and decreased in accordance with the differentiation. Zfp449 protein was also detected in articular cartilage of an adult mouse. During chondrogenic differentiation of human mesenchymal stem cells, ZNF449 was increased at an early stage, and its overexpression enhanced SOX9 and SOX6 only at the initial stage of the differentiation. We further generated Zfp449 knockout mice to examine the in vivo roles; however, no obvious abnormality was observed in skeletal development or articular cartilage homeostasis. ZNF449 may regulate chondrogenic differentiation from mesenchymal progenitor cells, although the underlying mechanisms are still unknown."
https://openalex.org/W2038033678,"Starting point for the present work was the assumption that the cell line MuMac-E8 represents a murine cell population with stem cell properties. Preliminary studies already pointed to the expression of stem-cell associated markers and a self-regenerative potential of the cells. The cell line MuMac-E8 should be examined for their differential stage within stem cell hierarchy. MuMac-E8 cells were derived from a chimeric mouse model of arthritis. It could be shown that MuMac-E8 cells express mRNA of some genes associated with pluripotent stem cells (Nanog, Nucleostemin), of genes for hematopoietic markers (EPCR, Sca-1, CD11b, CD45), for the mesenchymal marker CD105 and of genes for the neural markers Pax-6 and Ezrin. In methylcellulose and May-Grünwald-Giemsa staining, hematopoietic colonies were obtained but the hematopoietic system of lethally irradiated mice could not be rescued. Osteogenic differentiation was not detectable. Thus, it became evident that MuMac-E8 represents not a stem cell line. However, MuMac-E8 cells expressed several myeloid surface markers (i.e. CD11b, F4/80, CD14, CD64), showed phagocytosis and is capable of producing nitric oxide. Thus, this cell line seems to be arrested an advanced stage of myeloid differentiation. Adherence data measured by impedance-based real-time cell analysis together with cell morphology data suggested that MuMac-E8 represents a new macrophage precursor cell line exhibiting weak adherence. This cell line is suitable as an in-vitro model for testing of macrophage functions. Moreover, it might be also useful for differentiation or reprogramming studies."

However, almost all papers on the games and their applications are based on solutions built either upon an ad-hoc argument or a twisted Bayesian analysis of the games. Here, we present logical gaps in those solutions and offer an exact solution of our own. We also introduce a minor extension to the original game so that not only logical differences but also differences in action outcomes among those solutions become visible."
https://openalex.org/W2092226800,"Endothelial dysfunction is a key initiating event in vascular disease in chronic kidney disease (CKD) patients and haemodialysis (HD) patients exhibit significant vascular abnormalities. To understand this further, we examined how ex vivo intrinsic function in isolated arteries correlates with in vivo assessments of cardiovascular status in HD patients. Abdominal fat biopsies were obtained from 11 HD patients and 26 non-uremic controls. Subcutaneous arteries were dissected and mounted on a wire myograph, and cumulative concentration-response curves to noradrenalin, endothelin-1, a thromboxane A2 agonist (U46619), angiotensin II, vasopressin, bradykinin (BK), acetylcholine (ACh) and sodium nitroprusside (SNP) were constructed. Pulse wave velocity and blood pressure were measured in HD patients. Enhanced (P<0.05-0.0001) maximal contractile responses (Rmax) to all spasmogens (particularly vasopressin) were observed in arteries from HD patients compared to controls, and this effect was more pronounced in arteries with an internal diameter>600 µm. The potency (pEC50) of U46619 (P<0.01) and vasopressin (P<0.001) was also increased in arteries>600 µm of HD patients. The maximal relaxant response to the endothelium-dependent dilators ACh and BK were lower in HD patients (P<0.01-P<0.0001) (worse for ACh than BK); however the endothelium-independent dilator SNP was similar in both groups. PWV was significantly correlated with the vasoconstrictor response to vasopressin (P = 0.042) in HD patients. HD patients are primed for hypertension and end organ demand ischaemia by a highly sensitised pressor response. The failure of arterial relaxation is mediated by endothelial dysfunction. Intrinsic vascular abnormalities may be important in sensitising HD patients to recurrent cumulative ischaemic end organ injury."
