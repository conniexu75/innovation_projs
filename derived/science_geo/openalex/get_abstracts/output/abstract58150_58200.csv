The LRF effect on lordosis was seen 90, 180, and 360 minutes after injection. This effect could help to synchronize the female's mating behavior with the ovulatory discharge of luteinizing hormone."

The frequency distribution of the classes argues against the importance of neutral mutations in allozymic variation. Heterosis is not the universal cause of genic polymorphism."

https://openalex.org/W2268325201,"Abstract Partially purified enzyme preparations derived from a strain of Escherichia coli K12 with an amber mutation (polA1) in the DNA polymerase I gene contain approximately 1% as much polymerase I activity as the preparations from wild type strain purified by the same procedure. Two other polymerase I mutants, one temperature-sensitive (polA12) and the other nonsuppressible (polA5), also contain significant levels of polymerase I (12% and 35% of wild type, respectively). In the case of polA12, the polymerase I activity is abnormally thermolabile. The level of polymerase I observed in a given mutant is dependent, in part, on the pH and the template-primer used. Despite their low DNA polymerase I levels, these mutants possess nearly normal amounts of the 5' → 3' exonuclease activity that is known to be part of DNA polymerase I and is separable as a 2.8 S fragment by proteolytic cleavage. In the temperature-sensitive and nonsuppressible mutants, the 5' → 3' exonuclease and polymerase I activities cosediment at approximately 5.4 S just as in the wild type. In contrast, the polymerase I activity in the amber mutant sediments at 5.4 S, but the 5' → 3' exonuclease activity sediments at 2.8 S. These findings suggest that the residual DNA polymerase I activity sedimenting like the wild type enzyme in the polA1 mutants is the result of a low level read-through of the amber mutation, and that the 5' → 3' exonuclease represents the amber peptide, or a proteolytic cleavage product of it."

https://openalex.org/W1495437719,"Abstract Malonyl coenzyme A-acyl carrier protein transacylase of Escherichia coli was purified 4800-fold by procedures which included chromatography on DEAE-cellulose, Sephadex G-100, Sephadex G-75, DEAE-Sephadex, and preparative polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. The purified enzyme was shown to be homogeneous by electrophoresis on polyacrylamide gels, by sedimentation equilibrium centrifugation, and by amino acid analysis. A molecular weight of 36,660, obtained with carboxymethylated enzyme by sedimentation equilibrium measurements, agreed with determinations on the native enzyme by sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (36,500) and by Sephadex G-100 column chromatography (37,000). An s20,w = 2.31 S was determined for the enzyme by sedimentation velocity measurements. Amino acid analysis and determination of the isoelectric point (pH 4.65) both showed the enzyme to be acidic. The purified enzyme was inhibited by N-ethylmaleimide and to a lesser extent by iodoacetamide, but inhibition by both reagents was significantly increased at pH values above 7.3. Preincubation of the enzyme with malonyl-CoA protected against inactivation by both sulfhydryl reagents. Reduction of aged enzyme preparations by incubation with dithiothreitol was shown to stimulate enzyme activity approximately 5-fold. These experiments suggest that a reduced sulfhydryl group(s) on the enzyme is required for maximal catalytic activity."
https://openalex.org/W1549684468,"Abstract Potential roles for the single sulfhydryl group of the catalytic subunit of aspartate transcarbamylase from Escherichia coli have been investigated by means of chemical modification. The S-cyano and S-methyl derivatives are highly active and recombine normally with the zinc regulatory subunit. The derivatives of native enzyme formed in this way are fully responsive to homotropic and heterotropic allosteric effectors and have pH-activity curves indistinguishable from that of unmodified native enzyme. Therefore, despite strong evidence that the—SH group is at the active site, its integrity is not necessary for activity or for allosteric function. However, modifications which lead to negatively charged derivatives of the—SH group do result in inactivation. The reason for such loss of activity was investigated with a sulfonate derivative prepared by rapid and highly specific oxidation of the native enzyme with KMnO4. Carbamyl phosphate and the transition state analog N-(phosphonacetyl)-l-aspartate bind well to the sulfonate derivative, but the affinity of this derivative for succinate (in the presence of carbamyl-P) is much reduced when compared to that of native enzyme. The newly introduced negative charge apparently inactivates by greatly reducing the affinity of the active site for the substrate l-aspartate. The trimeric catalytic subunit is inactive after modification of the 3 identical —SH groups by dithionitrobenzoate, and the derivative is capable of binding tightly only 1 eq of either carbamyl-P or N-(phosphonacetyl)-l-aspartate per trimer, demonstrating a strong interaction among the three active sites of the isolated subunit. Furthermore, the thionitrobenzoate derivative of native aspartate transcarbamylase correspondingly binds only about 2 molecules of N-(phosphonacetyl)-l-aspartate per six active sites and binds them with strong positive cooperativity, suggesting that in unmodified native enzyme positive cooperativity is due at least in part to an interaction between the two catalytic trimers. If catalytic subunit is combined with a limiting amount of zinc regulatory subunit, a new species deficient in regulatory subunit is formed, with altered allosteric properties."

https://openalex.org/W1536211123,"Abstract A malonyl-enzyme intermediate, which functions in the transacylation of malonate from coenzyme A to acyl carrier protein (ACP) in Escherichia coli fatty acid synthesis, was isolated and characterized using purified and reduced malonyl-CoA-ACP transacylase. An enzymatically active malonyl-enzyme complex was isolated by Sephadex chromatography in 8 m urea, by trichloroacetic acid precipitation, and by Sephadex chromatography in aqueous buffer. The intermediate isolated by these procedures was shown to be free of CoA and capable of transferring the covalently bound malonyl group to CoA or ACP. Formation of malonyl-enzyme appeared to be a readily reversible reaction with a pH optimum between 6.0 and 7.5. Stability measurements of the malonyl-enzyme indicated a marked lability at pH values above 6.0, with a half-life of 30 to 40 min at pH 7.0 at 0°. The malonyl-enzyme linkage was shown to be stable to performic acid oxidation and labile to neutral hydroxylamine and alkaline pH. Denaturation of the malonyl-enzyme by urea at concentrations of 2.0 m or greater increased the stability of the malonyl-enzyme at various pH values and stabilized it to cleavage by hydroxylamine. Dilution of the urea concentration to 0.1 m permitted renaturation of the malonyl-enzyme, as indicated by its ability to transfer bound malonyl groups to CoA and its sensitivity to hydroxylamine and alkaline pH. A pH dependent inhibition of malonyl-enzyme formation was observed with the alkylating agents, N-ethylmaleimide and iodoacetamide. Treatment of the enzyme with phenylmethylsulfonylfluoride and p-chloromercuribenzoate also resulted in inhibition of malonyl-enzyme formation. p-Chloromercuribenzoate effects were shown to be reversed by 2-mercaptoethanol. Preincubation of the enzyme with malonyl-CoA prevented the inhibitory effects of all agents tested. Identification of the malonyl binding site on the enzyme was accomplished by proteolytic hydrolysis of [14C]malonyl-enzyme. Digestion of carboxymethylated [14C]malonyl-enzyme with thermolysin and purification of the labeled peptides by paper chromatography and Dowex 50 column chromatography resulted in the separation of five groups of labeled peptides, B through F. Treatment with performic acid indicated that the [14C]malonyl groups were not cleaved from these peptides by this treatment. Further purification of the major [14C]malonyl-peptide, D, by paper electrophoresis and by Dowex 50 chromatography after performic acid oxidation resulted in the isolation of a pure peptide with the amino acid composition alanine, glycine, histidine, and serine. Digestion of two of the [14C]malonyl-peptides, E and F, with aminopeptidase plus pronase resulted in the quantitative release of radioactive products having chromatographic properties identical with those of synthetic malonyl-O-serine. These experiments indicate that a serine residue of malonyl transacylase is the covalent binding site of malonyl groups in the malonyl-enzyme intermediate."
https://openalex.org/W1498837278,"Abstract Antibodies against inosine were prepared, purified, and characterized. The relative affinity of the antibodies for various nucleosides shows that inosine has a 180-fold higher affinity than guanosine, and that several inosine and guanosine analogues have at least a 4-fold lower affinity than guanosine. This difference in affinity allowed the separation of inosine and guanosine by chromatography on columns of anti-inosine antibody immobilized on Sepharose. A similar chromatographic procedure was used for the detection of inosine-containing tRNA species. When unfractionated Escherichia coli tRNA was chromatographed on the antibody column, inosine-containing tRNAarg was specifically retarded on the column. The specific retention of tRNAarg was abolished when the tRNA was cyanoethylated and then applied to the column. Similar results were obtained with purified tRNAarg. On the other hand, E. coli tRNAmet, tRNAile, tRNAthr, tRNAval, tRNA,ser as well as the majority of tRNApro were not retarded by the column indicating the absence of inosine residues in unpaired regions of these tRNAs. The advantage of this method is that unfractionated tRNA can be used for analysis."

https://openalex.org/W2157601025,"The core portion of the cell wall lipopolysaccharide of Escherichia coli J-5, an UDP-Gal epimerase-less mutant of E. coli 0111:B4, was subjected to detailed structural analysis. Lipopolysaccharide was isolated from cell envelope preparations by extraction with hot aqueous phenol followed by ultracentrifugation of the aqueous phase. Mild acid (pH 3.5) hydrolysis of lipopolysaccharide yielded a mixture of phosphorylated core oligosaccharides which were dephosphorylated by treatment with hydrofluoric acid at 0°. The mixture of dephosphorylated core oligosaccharides was resolved by paper chromatography, paper electrophoresis, and ion exchange chromatography into three components, designated A, B and C. Each of the oligosaccharides was shown to possess a single titratable carboxyl group and a single terminal reducing 3-keto-3-deoxyoctulosonate (KDO) residue. Analyses indicated the following molar ratios of constituents: A, glucose, heptose, glucosamine, and KDO (2:2:1:1); B, glucose, heptose, and KDO (1:3:1); and C, glucose, heptose, and KDO (1:2:1). The presence of unsubstituted glucosamine in A was confirmed by formation and subsequent isolation of dinitrophenylated glucosamine after treatment of the oligosaccharide with dinitrofluorobenzene and by demonstration of a titratable, free amino group in the polymer. The hexosamine isolated from A by hydrolysis was shown to be glucosamine by degradation to arabinose with ninhydrin. Linkage of the glucosamine moiety to heptose was established by isolation and characterization of glucosaminyl-heptose by controlled hydrolysis of A. Oligosaccharides A and C were characterized structurally by Smith degradation and specific enzymatic and chemical techniques as follows: [see PDF for equation] Because of uncertainty regarding the homogeneity of oligosaccharide B, its detailed structure was not determined unequivocally although it is tentatively proposed to be identical to oligosaccharide C except for a third heptose moiety substituting the heptose linked to KDO at position 6 or 7. Using cell envelope particulate fractions as a source of galactosyl transferase, it was demonstrated that [14C]galactose is incorporated into core oligosaccharides A and C with identical efficiency whereas no detectable quantity of galactose was incorporated into the B structure. The galactosyltransferase system exclusively transfers galactose residues from UDP-galactose to terminal nonreducing glucose residues of oligosaccharides A and C."

https://openalex.org/W1496658385,"Abstract The effect of AMP on the kinetic parameters, Vmax, Km, and Hill coefficient for l-threonine, as well as the effect of enzyme concentration on the Ka and Hill coefficient for AMP were determined for the biodegradative l-threonine dehydrase of Escherichia coli. These values were affected by the order of addition of assay components and the manner in which the enzyme was diluted. For instance, dilutions in the absence of AMP followed by assays with graded levels of AMP resulted in a degree of inactivation which was dependent upon the concentrations of AMP and enzyme; on the other hand, no inactivation occurred when the dehydrase was diluted and assayed in 5 mm AMP. A correction procedure is described which nullifies this spurious effect. The kinetic parameters determined following correction were Km for threonine = 70 mm without and 3.1 with 5 mm AMP; Vmax = 489 µmoles min-1 mg of protein-1 at 28° in the absence of AMP and 478 µmoles min-1 mg of protein-1 in the presence of 5 mm AMP. The Hill coefficients for l-threonine were 1.2 to 1.6 without and 1.0 with 5 mm AMP. The Ka value and Hill coefficient for AMP was dependent on dehydrase concentration."
https://openalex.org/W1606834440,"Abstract The relationship between the AMP-induced increases in molecular weight and the AMP-promoted decrease in Km for l-threonine for the biodegradative l-threonine dehydrase of Escherichia coli was investigated. The sedimentation velocity in sucrose gradients over a range of 0.07 to 22 µg of dehydrase in the presence of AMP showed little effect of protein concentration (ranging from 7.5 to 8.1 S). In the absence of AMP, the sedimentation velocity increased with protein concentration over the range of 0.61 to 366 µg from 3.7 to 6.4 S. Extrapolation of the line to zero protein concentration indicated a limiting s value of 3.2 S. Oligomers formed at high protein concentration (1 mg ml-1) in the absence of AMP were shown by direct determination in stopped flow assays to have a Km for l-threonine significantly higher than observed in the absence of AMP at much lower protein concentration where monomer would be present. Therefore, oligomer formation alone is not a sufficient condition to cause the allosteric kinetic effect observed with AMP; namely, a decrease in Km for threonine. Following dilution of the concentrated dehydrase in the absence of AMP, an activation was observed upon addition of AMP; the activation was shown to be second order in protein concentration as determined by integral, differential, and fractional time methods. Therefore, the rate limiting step for activation is a dimerization process. These results show that oligomerization is a necessary, although not a sufficient, condition to cause the decrease in Km for threonine elicited by AMP. They also indicate that the sequential isomerization and concerted isomerization models of allosteric behavior are not well suited to the biodegradative threonine dehydrase."

https://openalex.org/W1596246986,"Abstract The site of AMP activation of the biodegradative l-threonine dehydrase of Escherichia coli was established by spectrophotometric and circular dichroic measurements, and by determining the Ki values in the presence and absence of AMP for a series of threonine analogs which undergo various partial reactions of the mechanism except dehydration. It was found that AMP greatly enhanced (a) the accumulation of an intermediate absorbing at 455 nm; (b) loss of circular dichroism; and (c) the binding of l-analogs of threonine including those which did not have an amino group. From observations with inhibitors and other published results, it was postulated that the intermediate absorbing at 455 nm is the Schiff base of α-aminocrotonate and pyridoxal phosphate. Similarly, it was concluded that loss of circular dichroism reflected the accumulation of Schiff bases between pyridoxal phosphate and l-threonine as well as with α-aminocrotonate. The major conclusion reached was that AMP enhances the first partial reaction of the sequence; namely, the noncovalent binding of threonine to the dehydrase."

https://openalex.org/W207695574,"Abstract The l-arabinose operon is under both positive and negative control by the product of its regulatory gene, araC. We have measured transcription of the arabinose genes by hybridization of 3H-labeled messenger RNA to single-stranded DNA from an arabinose transducing phage in order to study the effect of the regulatory gene on transcription. In strains in which the arabinose regulatory gene is completely nonfunctional due to deletion or nonsense mutation, only lack of activator, the positive controlling element, prevents expression of the arabinose operon. In these strains no mRNA from the arabinose operon can be detected, indicating that the positive control is exerted on the transcription process. Arabinoseconstitutive mutants which make functional activator in the absence of arabinose or which do not need the activator function for enzyme synthesis produce mRNA from the arabinose operon even in the absence of inducer. When an araC+ F'ara episome is introduced into these constitutive strains, making them diploid for the arabinose genes, the araC+ gene provides repressor function and transcription of the operon is shut off in the absence of inducer, demonstrating that negative control also functions at the transcription step. A number of araC mutants producing lower than wild type levels of enzymes from the arabinose operon were shown to have correspondingly lower levels of mRNA from the operon. These results are consistent with the hypothesis that the araC gene affects only the process of transcription of the arabinose operon."

https://openalex.org/W2007264858,"THE ability of mouse liver to convert mouse or bovine albumin to a faster migrating band under acid conditions of electrophoresis has recently been found to be controlled by a dominant gene, as observed in the SWR/J and several other strains of mice1. Other strains, such as C3H/HeJ, had the recessive allele and were unable to convert albumin. The conditions used included a pH at which conformational changes in albumin are known to occur, suggesting that the strains of mice differ in a factor in the liver capable of converting albumin to a different conformational state. I report here evidence that the conversion of albumin can be reversed by lowering the pH markedly. This provides further evidence that a conformational change has taken place."

https://openalex.org/W1506891473,Abstract The biosynthesis of the pyridoxal phosphate-dependent enzyme imidazolylacetolphosphate aminotransferase (EC 2.6.1.9) was investigated in a pyridoxine auxotroph of Salmonella typhimurium grown under conditions in which the intracellular pool size of pyridoxal phosphate would be expected to be low. In the absence of cofactor the apoprotein is synthesized at a normal rate and is stable in vivo. The protein assumes a tertiary and quaternary structure very similar to that of holoenzyme since apoenzyme sediments through sucrose gradients at the same rate as the holoenzyme and apoenzyme can be constituted in vitro with pyridoxal phosphate. We conclude that there is no stoichiometric cofactor involvement during the biosynthesis of this protein. The cofactor does play a positive role in maintaining the structural integrity of the protein since apoprotein loses its ability to be constituted after short incubations at 45° and after chromatography through Sephadex G-200 gels. Binding of cofactor to apoprotein protects against both perturbations.
