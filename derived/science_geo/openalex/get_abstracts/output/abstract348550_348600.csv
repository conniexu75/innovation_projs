https://openalex.org/W1997976406,"IN recent years Szent-Györgyi has directed attention to the possible importance of the electrical properties of organic molecules in biochemical catalysis1 and has given evidence for photoconductivity in gelatin2. An approach to the theory in trans-conjugated polyenes has been indicated by N. S. Bayliss3. Hoping to obtain a system suitable for quantitative investigation, I have examined the electrical conductivity of two phthalocyanines. These substances, described by Linstead and co-workers4, form a group of conjugated structures closely related to the biologically important porphyrins. They are particularly suitable for a research of this kind, because of their high degree of involatility and thermal stability. Their crystal structures are known from the work of J. M. Robertson5."

N+(CH3)3] 2In) appear to possess activities which may be suitable for clinical use—the C 10 derivative (n = 10) to produce neuromuscular block, the C 6 derivative (n = 6) to produce ganglionic block. We wish to describe briefly the main characteristics of these compounds, in view of the great attention being paid to possible substitutes for d-tubocurarine chloride2,3 and to the use of tetraethylammonium iodide for ganglionic block4."

https://openalex.org/W177174325,"A method for the determination of protein in urine by means of the biuret reaction was described by Hiller (1) and by Hiller, McIntosh, and Van Slyke (2), in which pure biuret prepared by Kahlbaum was used as a standard for visual calorimetry. Since Hiller (1) the biuret method has been used for the determination of urinary proteins by Price (3) and by Lehmann (4), and has been widely used in many forms and modifications for the determination of plasma proteins. A review of the literature on the biuret method will not be given here, but may be found in the papers of KiintzeI and Droscher (5) and of Robinson and Hogden (6). The latter workers studied the conditions necessary for the production of a stable color which bears a quantitative relationship to the protein concentration and also published transmission curves for the biuret color. The present paper describes a photometric method for the determination of urinary protein in which the entire procedure is carried out in a single test-tube, which serves as a cuvette for the photoelectric spectrophotometer. The method can be used even when the urine contains Evans blue excreted after blood volume determinations. Since pure preparations of biuret are not now obtainable on the market, solutions of urinary proteins, of concentration determined by accurate Kjeldahl analysis, are used to prepare standard optical density curves, and the use of a chrome-alum solution for checking the curves is detailed."

Also it is widely recognized that on ‘going out to grass' cows often show an increase in milk yield, greater than the amount ascribable to the extra nutrients ingested."

https://openalex.org/W1662936748,"IN a case of erythroblastosis fœtalis the mother was found to belong to the rare Rh phenotype which includes the genotype R' R"". Rh-typing of her family makes it clear that the genotype is, in fact, CdE/cde or Ryr (or, in the latest nomenclature of Dr. Wiener, ryr). The combination CdE has never previously been clearly demonstrated1–5. The claim of Stancu, Clark and Snyder6 to have discovered CdE seems insufficiently documented for so important a claim."

https://openalex.org/W2026603001,"HEIFERS and cows with regular æstrous cycle were inseminated several hours (6–12 up to 48 hours) before the expected æstrus. The sperm used in these experiments was collected from the two bulls of the artificial insemination centre; it was diluted 1/50 in sodium citrate – egg yolk diluent and inseminated by rectal fixation of the cervix. In most of the cows the operation was executed very easily, and the insemination was made partly in the corpus uteri and partly in the cervix; exceptionally the cervix is insufficiently dilated, but penetration with the catheter was possible though more difficult than in the heat-period."
https://openalex.org/W2044974183,"THE increasing use of radioactive tracers in biology demands methods for quantitative recording even in tissue sections. Autoradiography furnishes one method, either by simply placing the sections containing the radio-ions towards a photographic plate1, or by covering the section itself with a film of photographic emulsion2,3. In this way α- and even βrays can be recorded4."

https://openalex.org/W2094833485,"THE following bactericidal substances—trypaflavine (5 × 10-4 M), methylene blue (1 × 10-3 M), protamine sulphate (2.5 × 10-4 M), chinine (2·5 × 10-3 M) and crystal violet (1 × 10-4 M)—cause a strong and progressive inhibition of the respiration of bakers' yeast, suspended in glucose phosphate at 28° C. (cf. also ref. 1). Spermine and streptomycin, though also basic substances, even at high concentrations (1 × 10-2 M and 1 × 10-2 M respectively) do not affect the respiration of yeast and thus have no direct bactericidal activity. It can be shown that all these substances, the inhibitors as well as spermine and streptomycine, compete for the same negative components of the yeast cell, when brought in contact with a yeast suspension2."
https://openalex.org/W1978157001,"THE examination of meristems in root tips and young ovules in the c2-generation bushes grown from seed of colchicine-induced tetraploid Ribes nigrum (2n = 32) showed that the chromosome number varies greatly from one to another. The lowest number found was 4, all numbers between 4 and 32 being observed. Statistics on the frequency of the different chromosome numbers shows that the distribution is in its main features binomial, the peak lying at the diploid number 2n = 16. All numbers divisible by four are more frequent than might be expected on random distribution."
https://openalex.org/W2038840711,"THE John Innes Horticultural Institution is perhaps best known in the scientific world for its great part in genetical work, under its three successive directors, Bateson, Hall and Darlington. While its contributions to science in the field of cytogenetics have been so outstanding, sight must not be lost of the more directly horticultural research in the applied sphere which has steadily progressed at the Institution and which has resulted in advances of knowledge no whit less important. Throughout, the work has been a model of what applied research should be, the scientific approach to the problems of the practical grower. The work of M. B. Crane on compatibility and incompatibility in fruits illustrates this conception of applied research in a striking manner ; not only does it constitute an outstanding advance in scientific knowledge, but also it is the foundation of all modern systems of orchard planning. His ""Fertility Rules in Fruit Planning"" (Leaflet No. 4 of the new collected edition of the John Innes Leaflets*) is the vade mecum of all growers laying out new plantations."

https://openalex.org/W1996550889,WHEAT bran has been frequently used as an ingredient in media for culturing micro-organisms. Good results have been recorded from this laboratory for penicillin production by P. notatum1 and streptomycin formation by S. griseus2. Detailed systematic investigations carried out to discover the factors in wheat bran extract responsible for these results have shown that the ash of the extract is mainly concerned so far as streptomycin is concerned.

https://openalex.org/W4240782781,"IN his paper ""Mechanism of Nuclear Fission"", Bohr1 has explained the emission of delayed neutrons from certain members of the fission chains as due to the product being in a sufficiently highly excited state after the emission of β-particles. Of the other possibilities, production of delayed neutrons by (γ, n) reaction by the γ-rays after a β-disintegration, following Bohr, can be excluded simply because of the absence of sufficiently energetic γ-rays in fission chains reported in the Plutonium Project Report2."
