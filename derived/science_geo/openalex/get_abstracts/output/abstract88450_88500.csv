https://openalex.org/W100430351,"Vertebrate skeletal muscle contraction is the result of a cyclic interaction of thick myosin filaments with the thin filaments, composed primarily of actin, troponin, and tropomyosin, causing these two sets of filaments to slide past each other (2, 3). This cycling is driven by the hydrolysis of ATP by myosin in a reaction which is activated by actin. When the sarcoplasmic reticulum lowers the free Ca2+ concentration from 10−5 to <10−7 m, muscle contraction ceases and the associated actin-activated myosin ATPase activity is inhibited. The proteins troponin and tropomyosin are responsible for this effect of Ca2+ on the interaction between myosin and actin (4, 5).

The tropomyosin molecules lie end to end along the two grooves of the F-actin filament with each tropomyosin molecule binding to seven actin monomers (6). Troponin consists of three subunits, and one troponin molecule is bound to each tropomyosin molecule. The binding of Ca2+ to troponin determines the position of tropomyosin on the F-actin filament. At levels of Ca2+ low enough to cause relaxation, tropomyosin is positioned away from the central groove of the F-actin filament where it appears that it might interfere with the binding of the myosin cross-bridge (7–9). This structural work formed the basis of the steric blocking hypothesis which suggests that relaxation occurs when tropomyosin, in the “relaxed” position, physically blocks the binding of the myosin cross-bridge to actin. Three-dimensional reconstructions from electron micro-graphs have suggested that the myosin cross-bridge and the tropomyosin molecule may be in close contact with each other on the actin filament, a requirement for a steric blocking type model (10, 11).

The steric blocking model predicts that in the absence of Ca2+ the degree of association of S-11 should be much weaker with regulated actin than with unregulated actin. In fact, Greene and Eisenberg (12) have recently demonstrated that, in the absence of Ca2+, the binding of S-1·ADP to regulated actin is strongly inhibited in a cooperative manner. At low levels of saturation of the actin filament with S-1·ADP, the binding of S-1·ADP to the regulated actin filament is about 103 weaker than at high levels of saturation. However, the fact that S-1·ADP binds weakly to regulated actin does not prove the steric blocking model since, in relaxed muscle, the cross-bridges normally exist with bound ATP (or ADP · Pi) and not bound ADP (13,14). Therefore, the steric blocking model predicts that troponin-tropomyosin should inhibit the binding of S-1·ADP·Pi as well as S-1·ADP to regulated actin in the absence of Ca2+.

Using stopped flow turbidity measurements, we have previously measured the effect of Ca2+ on the association of S-1 · ATP and S-1 · ADP · Pi with regulated actin (15). Surprisingly, in the absence of Ca2+, the binding constant of S-1 · ATP or S-1 · ADP · Pi to regulated actin was only decreased to 56% of the value in the presence of Ca2+ although the rate of ATP hydolysis under the same conditions was decreased to 6% of the rate with Ca2+ present. These data suggest, in disagreement with the steric blocking model, that inhibition of the rate of ATP hydrolysis, in the absence of Ca2+, is not the result of inhibition of the binding of S-1 to regulated actin.

In the present study, we have reinvestigated this problem using a different and more direct measurement of binding. Free S-1 was separated from actin-bound S-1 in the presence of ATP by rapid centrifugation in an air-driven ultracentrifuge and the free S-1 concentration was then determined by an ATPase assay. As in our earlier turbidity studies, we find very little effect of troponin-tropomyosin on the binding of S-1 to regulated actin in the presence of ATP. Similar confirmation of our turbidity results has already been reported by Wagner and Giniger (16). In the present study, we have also measured the binding at a higher ionic strength (50 mm) and here too have found no correlation between the inhibition of ATPase rate and the binding of S-1·ATP or S-1 · ADP · Pi to regulated actin. Finally, we demonstrate that the removal of Ca2+ affects the rate of regulated actin-activated S-1-ATPase activity primarily by lowering the maximum ATPase rate (Vmax) rather than the apparent binding constant of S-1 to actin (KATPase). These data imply that, in the absence of Ca2+, troponin-tropomyosin inhibits the ATPase activity by inhibiting a kinetic step in the cycle of ATP hydrolysis, perhaps Pi release."

https://openalex.org/W2000467705,"Reversion analysis of flagellar-motility mutants of Chlamydomonas reinhardtii yields an unusual class of intergenic suppressor mutations that restore flagellar activity to paralyzed radial-spoke or central-pair mutants without altering the structural or molecular defects associated with the original mutations. Four suppressors representing independent genetic loci were studied in detail. Two of the mutations, suppf1 and suppf2, restore flagellar motility to either radial-spoke or central-pair mutants of different genes. The mutants suppf3 and suppf 4 suppress flagellar paralysis associated only with mutants defective for the radial spokes. Analyses of the axonemal polypeptides of suppf1, suppf3 and suppf4 mutants indicate that the mutations restore flagellar activity to paralyzed radial-spoke or central-pair mutants by altering other components of the flagellar axoneme. suppf1 shows an altered electrophoretic migration for a 325,000 molecular weight polypeptide known to be a subunit of an outer-arm dynein. suppf3 and suppf4 are missing different axonemal polypeptides with molecular weights of 60,000 (in the case of suppf3), and 40,000 and 29,000 (in the case of suppf4). Genetic evidence has been obtained indicating that the polypeptides affected in suppf3 and suppf4 are components of a newly identified functional and/or structural compartment of the flagellar axoneme. The suppressor mutations described here reveal the operation of a control mechanism that inhibits the operations of flagellar movements in the presence of radial-spoke or central-pair defects. Suppressor mutations release the inhibition. The molecular defects of suppf1, suppf3 and suppf4 provide evidence that the inhibitory mechanism can be interrupted at two different levels of axonemal function."

https://openalex.org/W1535064294,"A post-translational processing assay of the precursor to the yeast F1-ATPase subunit has been utilized to examine a mitochondrial endoprotease which cleaves this subunit precursor to the size of a mature subunit. The endoprotease is extracted from purified mitochondria as a soluble complex of Mr = 115,000 which is composed of subunits of lower molecular weight when examined on sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. It exhibits a pH optimum of between pH 7 and 8 and is inactive at pH 6.5 and below. The mitochondrial endoprotease is insensitive to serine esterase inhibitors, but is inhibited by EDTA and o-phenanthroline. Restoration of precursor subunit processing activity in the presence of metal chelators is strictly dependent on excess Co2+ and Mn2+ over other heavy metals examined. These and additional data indicate that this soluble metallo endoprotease is involved in the processing of other cytoplasmically synthesized precursor subunits of the ATPase complex in addition to the subunit 2 precursor. The role of this processing enzyme in the assembly of mitochondrial inner membrane complexes is discussed in light of the current model of mitochondrial biogenesis."

https://openalex.org/W1604437810,"The site of recA cleavage of the phage lambda and P22 repressors has been determined. Each repressor is cut once by the recA enzyme, lambda repressor between residues 111 and 112, and P22 repressor between residues 94 and 95. recA cleavage occurs at identical alanyl-glycyl sequences in both repressors, and in both repressors, the cleavage separates the repressor's NH2-terminal DNA-binding domain from its COOH-terminal oligomerization domain. A papain-generated proteolytic fragment of lambda repressor consisting of repressor residues 93-236 is also efficiently cleaved by recA protein. Moreover, the recA cleavage of radioactive lambda repressor can be inhibited by certain COOH-terminal proteolytic fragments of lambda repressor which do not contain the alanyl-glycyl cleavage sequence. These facts suggest that recA cleavage of lambda repressor requires an intact COOH-terminal domain but not an intact NH2-terminal domain."
https://openalex.org/W2064517451,"Two dyneins have been isolated from axonemes of Chlamydomonas flagella by a three step procedure consisting of extraction in a high salt containing buffer, hydroxyapatite chromatography and sedimentation in sucrose gradient. A dynein with Mg+2-dependent ATPase activity 6.0 μmole Pi/min/mg, sedimenting at 12.5S was found associated with a polypeptide of molecular weight 310,000. A second dynein with specific activity of 3.7, sedimenting at 10–11S was found associated with a polypeptide of molecular weight 315,000. In their most purified forms, the two dyneins are complexed with nonstoichiometric amounts of four polypeptides ranging in molecular weight between 42,000 and 19,000. The 42,000 component has been identified previously as an actin-like protein. The high molecular weight subunits of both dyneins and two polypeptides of 28,000 and 19,000 molecular weight were found to be phosphorylated by in vivo pulse-labeling with 32P-phosphoric acid. All components of the 12.5S and 10–11S dynein complexes, with the exception of the 19,000 polypeptide, form a subset of polypeptides found to be deficient in pf-23, a Chlamydomonas mutant, which is defective for inner arms."
https://openalex.org/W2075677200,"Crude and highly purified SV40 large T antigen has been found to exist in forms of various sizes. Immunoreactive structures of 5.5S (80–85 kd), 7S (∼150 kd) and 15.5S (325–340 kd) have been identified by zonal sedimentation and gel filtration. They appear to correspond to monomeric, dimeric and tetrameric species of T, respectively, and are free of detectable 55 kd NVT by specific immunoprecipitation analyses. While highly purified monomer appears relatively inactive in SV40 DNA-binding and ATPase assays, both the dimer and tetramer display these activities. By contrast, all three comigrate with casein kinase activity. These data suggest that the protein can exist as a monomer and in various homoaggregated forms. In addition, it appears that it must aggregate to be an active DNA-binding element and an ATPase."

https://openalex.org/W1541932063,"Profilin inhibits the rate of nucleation of actin polymerization and the rate of filament elongation and also reduces the concentration of F-actin at steady state. Addition of profilin to solutions of F-actin causes depolymerization. The same steady state concentrations of polymerized and nonpolymerized actin are reached whether profilin is added before initiation of polymerization or after polymerization is complete. The KD for formation of the 1:1 complex between Acanthamoeba profilin and Acanthamoeba actin is in the range of 4 to 11 microM; the KD for the reaction between Acanthamoeba profilin and rabbit skeletal muscle actin is about 60 to 80 microM, irrespective of the concentrations of KCl or MgCl2. The critical concentration of actin for polymerization and the KD for the actin-profilin interaction are independent of each other; therefore, a change in the critical concentration of actin alters the amount of actin bound to profilin at steady state. As a consequence, the presence of profilin greatly amplifies the effects of small changes in the actin critical concentration on the concentration of F-actin. Profilin also inhibits the ATPase activity of monomeric actin, the profilin-actin complex being entirely inactive."

https://openalex.org/W2079081124,"Permeabilized PtK1 cells continue to undergo anaphase chromosome movements provided MgATP is included in the lysis medium. However, chromosome-to-pole movement (anaphase A) and spindle elongation (anaphase B) differ with respect to nucleotide requirements. The rate of anaphase B depends on the concentration of ATP in the lysis medium; two-thirds the maximal rate is observed in 0.2 mM ATP. However, other nucleotides, such as ITP, CTP and GTP, cannot substitute for ATP. Spindle elongation is blocked by the addition of nonhydrolyzable ATP analogs. ADP, AMP and inhibitors such as vanadate, the magnesium chelator EDTA and sulfhydryl reagents. Anaphase does no require exogenous ATP and is unaffected by these inhibitors. These results are consistent with ""dynein-like"" ATPase involvement during spindle elongation, and rule out the possibility of tubulin-dynein and actomyosin mechanochemistry during anaphase A. I suggest that chromosome-to-pole movement involves the collapse of an elastic component in the spindle. Force generation could be provided by microtubule depolymerization or by the contraction of a nonmicrotubule microtrabecular lattice."

https://openalex.org/W1499357361,"Dexamethasone induces an inhibitor of plasminogen-dependent fibrinolysis in rat hepatoma (HTC) cells. The specificity of the inhibitor for urokinase and plasmin was investigated using both fibrinolytic and esterolytic assays. Urokinase, but not plasmin, was inhibited by serum-free conditioned medium from cells incubated with 0.1 microM dexamethasone. The specificity of the inhibitor for plasminogen activator was demonstrated directly by the inhibition of the urokinase-catalyzed activation of 125I-plasminogen to 125I-plasmin. The inhibitory activity was stable to pH 3 for 2 h at 37 degrees C, a condition which inactivated fibrinolytic inhibitors in serum, suggesting a cellular origin for the inhibitor. Further evidence for the cellular origin was the constant daily production of inhibitor throughout a 4-day incubation with dexamethasone in serum-free medium. SF HTC-H1 cells, selected for their ability to grow in serum-free medium (Thompson, E. B., Anderson, C. U., and Lippman, M. E. (1975) J. Cell Physiol. 86, 403-412), were grown for 76 days (at least 30 generations) in the presence or absence of serum; dexamethasone induced equivalent amounts of inhibitory activity in cells which had been grown under both conditions. We conclude that the dexamethasone-induced inhibitor from HTC cells is a cellular product which is specific for the inhibition of plasminogen activation and which differs from other reported fibrinolytic inhibitors."

https://openalex.org/W1495554302,"The acyl-phosphate intermediate of the sarcoplasmic reticulum calcium ATPase reaction, formed in a brief incubation of vesicular enzyme with 5 microM [gamma-32P]ATP and calcium, reacts biphasically with added ADP (pH 7.0, 25 degrees C, 100 mM KCl, 5 mM MgSO4). Both the burst size and the rate constant for the slow phase increase with increasing ADP concentration in the way that is expected if the burst represents very rapid formation of an equilibrium amount of enzyme-bound ATP and the slow phase represents rate-limiting dissociation of ATP. Also consistent with this interpretation are the slow labeling of phosphoenzyme under conditions in which unlabeled ATP must dissociate first and the observation of a burst of ATP formation on ADP addition to phosphoenzyme. Values of the equilibrium constants for ADP dissociation from phosphoenzyme (0.75 mM), for ATP formation on the enzyme (2.3), and for the ATP dissociation rate constant (37 s-1) were obtained from a quantitative analysis of the data."

Autoantibodies to nucleosomal proteins were detected in 45 percent of the patients with SLE, 18 percent of the MCTD patients, and none of the RA patients. The results suggest that, in SLE, antibodies are formed against a subset of nucleosomes which contain protein HMG-17."

(Goodwin, G. H., Sanders, C., and Johns, E. W. (1973) Eur. J. Biochem. 38, 14-19). Analysis of their amino acid composition, electrophoretic mobility, and tryptic peptide map reveal the identity of the single-stranded DNA binding protein with HMG1 protein, implying that the rat liver HMG1 protein becomes able both to destabilize a double helix of DNA and to stimulate homologous DNA polymerases only when rat liver cells enter a phase of DNA synthesis, possibly after a specific modification."
https://openalex.org/W1581458636,"The site I redox-driven H+ pump has been activated by the addition of exogenous quinones to antimycin A-KCN-inhibited mitochondria. The rate of quinone reduction and the degree of rotenone sensitivity increase in the order, duroquinone less than ubiquinone0 less than ubiquinone1. Apparent Km, Vmax, and degree of sigmoidicity during e- transfer in the absence and presence of rotenone have been determined for each quinone. The data support the view that the NADH dehydrogenase possesses two redox sites, one accounting for the rotenone-sensitive reduction and another accounting for the rotenone-insensitive reduction. The degree of activation of the redox H+ pump, which reflects the rotenone-sensitive e- transfer, depends, for each quinone, on the relative Km, Vmax, and sigmoidicity of the rotenone-sensitive and insensitive processes. The redox H+ pump activation is highest with ubiquinone1, where the rotenone-sensitive reaction has a lower Km than that of the rotenone-insensitive reaction, and lowest with duroquinone where the rotenone-insensitive reaction has a high Vmax and no sigmoidicity with respect to that of the rotenone-sensitive reaction. Using ubiquinone1 the stoichiometry of the site I redox-driven H+ pump has been determined on either the flow or the force ratios. The flow ratios approached values of 4 H+/2 e- under conditions close to stationary state for H+ pumping and to zero for H+ electrochemical gradient. The force ratio also approached values close to 4 H+/2 e- under static head conditions."

https://openalex.org/W1504590820,"The activation by proteases of the Ca2+-dependent ATPase of chloroplast coupling factor 1 (CF1) has been investigated. Using low concentrations of papain and trypsin, the increase in ATPase activity and the degradation of the five subunits of CF1 were compared. Sodium dodecyl sulfate-gel electrophoresis of protease-treated CF1 revealed that the delta subunit was very rapidly degraded and that the alpha and beta subunits were clipped. The gamma and epsilon subunits were more resistant to digestion. The modification of the alpha subunit of latent CF1 most closely correlated with the activation of Ca2+-ATPase activity. Trypsin treatment of dithiothreitol-activated CF1 resulted in a very rapid increase in Ca2+-ATPase activity and a corresponding rapid cleavage of the gamma subunit to a 25,000-dalton species. With more prolonged treatment, the 25,000-dalton species was cleaved to fragments of 14,000 and 11,000-daltons. Dithiothreitol treatment did not alter the rate of attack on the other subunits. The gamma subunit of heat-activated CF1 was also more susceptible to protease digestion. The increased protease sensitivity of the gamma subunit of soluble CF1 after treatment with dithiothreitol or heat mimics the increased protease sensitivity of the gamma subunit of bound CF1 when thylakoids are treated with trypsin during illumination (Moroney, J. V., and McCarty, R. E. (1982) J. Biol. Chem. 257, 5915-5920). These results suggest that the conformational changes that occur when purified CF1 is exposed to dithiothreitol are similar to those that CF1 bound to thylakoid membranes undergoes under illumination."
https://openalex.org/W1555401845,"The degradation rates of inner mitochondrial membrane proteins were examined in serum-deprived hepatoma cultures. In those nonproliferating cells, the degradation of composite mitochondrial proteins was a first order process with a half-life of 34 h. The half-lives of specific inner mitochondrial membrane polypeptides were determined by examining the 3H/35S of isolated polypeptides from cells given [3H]methionine and [35S]methionine pulses, respectively, before and after a 2-day chase period. The 33 most abundant polypeptides resolved on a bidirectional polyacrylamide gel system showed half-lives ranging from 20 to 100+ h. The 15 polypeptides translated on mitochondrial ribosomes in the presence of inhibitory concentrations of cycloheximide also displayed heterogeneous rates of degradation (t1/2 = 35-100+ h). None of the isolated adenosine triphosphatase (coupling factor F1) or immunoprecipitated cytochrome c oxidase subunits were significantly turned over during the case period. Five of eight cytochrome b-c1 complex subunits, however, were turned over significantly more rapidly (t1/2 = 39-42 h) than the other three (t1/2 = 94+ h). The results demonstrate heterogeneous degradation rates for inner membrane polypeptides, extending in some cases to those within the same respiratory complex."

https://openalex.org/W1481132977,"Purified human C9 was treated separately with three proteolytic enzymes: trypsin, plasmin, and alpha-thrombin, and the digestion products were analyzed by sodium dodecyl sulfate polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. Trypsin initially cleaved the Mr = 71,000 C9 to produce a Mr = 47,000 fragment plus numerous smaller fragments and prolonged digestion reduced the molecule to small polypeptides. Plasmin produced a Mr = 37,000 fragment which was stable to further digestion, plus fragments smaller than Mr = 10,000. Human alpha-thrombin cleaved C9 (7.8% carbohydrate) at a single internal site to produce a Mr = 37,000 fragment (11.3% carbohydrate) and a Mr = 34,000 fragment (3.9% carbohydrate). Statistical analysis of the amino acid compositions of the fragments and alkaline polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis showed that C9 is highly amphiphilic; the Mr = 34,000 fragment contains a majority of the acidic amino acids and migrates rapidly on alkaline gels; the Mr = 37,000 fragment is hydrophobic with a slow electrophoretic mobility. The two fragments remain noncovalently associated, but were separated by sodium dodecyl sulfate-hydroxylapatite chromatography. The NH2-terminal sequence analysis of native C9, of alpha-thrombin-cleaved C9, and for the isolated fragments showed that the acidic Mr = 34,000 fragment is the NH2-terminal C9a domain and the more hydrophobic Mr = 37,000 fragment is the carboxyl-terminal C9b domain. Hemolytic activity of C9 was unaffected by alpha-thrombin cleavage."

Measurements using a calcium ionophore suggest this activation was the result of rendering the vesicles permeable to calcium. Complete activity is preserved at a detergent concentration range in which the detergent is complexed with the monomeric form of the ATPase, as measured by Sepharose 6B chromatography. Using a calibrated column, we found the C12E9 complex to have a Stokes radius of 55 A. As measured by time-resolved fluorescence anisotropy decay experiments, it had a rotational correlation coefficient of 214 ns, which is equivalent to a Stokes radius of 59 A. The axial ratio of the corresponding ellipsoid of revolution is calculated to be 5 to 6, indicating the complex is quite asymmetric. Like the vesicular form of the ATPase, the detergent-solubilized monomeric form bound with high affinity about 9 nmol of Ca2+/mg of protein. Also, like the vesicular enzyme, the solubilized form displayed a Ca2+ dependence of the activation of ATP hydrolysis which was cooperative (Hill coefficient 1.8). These results suggest that the calcium sites interact intramolecularly."
https://openalex.org/W1488537321,"The role of AMP deaminase (EC 3.5.4.6) reaction in the stimulation of the regulatory enzymes of glycolysis was investigated using permeabilized yeast cells. 1) The addition of polyamine activated AMP deaminase in situ, resulting in the subsequent increase in ammonium production, which can stimulate the activity of 6-phosphofructokinase (EC 2.7.1.11) and pyruvate kinase (EC 2.7.1.40). 2) Zn2+ inhibited AMP deaminase activity, followed by a decrease in ammonium ion concentration which reduced the activity of phosphofructokinase. 3) Polyamine and Zn2+ did not activate or inhibit directly the activity of phosphofructokinase and pyruvate kinase. 4) A simple Michaelis-Menten relationship was observed between the various levels of ammonium ion and of fructose 1,6-biphosphate formed in situ, indicating that phosphofructokinase activity or glycolytic flux was dependent upon the level of ammonium produced through the action of AMP deaminase. 5) The increase in Pi concentration resulted in the decreased magnitude of activation by NH4+ and marked stimulation by Pi itself of phosphofructokinase, and further reduced the production of NH4+ through the inhibition of AMP deaminase, suggesting that phosphofructokinase activity may not be regulated by the level of NH4+ but by Pi concentration under conditions of increased Pi levels. The AMP deaminase-ammonium system shows a regulatory function in glycolysis of yeast cells in the presence of physiological Pi levels, whereas glycolysis may be principally controlled by Pi level under the conditions of elevated Pi concentration. Polyamines may play a part in the stimulation of glycolysis through the elevated level of ammonium ion under the conditions of increased ATP utilization during cell proliferation, and can participate in the catabolic processes as well as anabolic processes through the stimulation of the AMP deaminase-ammonium system."

HMG 14 and 17, but not HMB 1 and 2, were phosphorylated in the nuclei of all cell lines with a serine being the site of modification for both proteins in Ehrlich ascites cells. Phosphorylation of HMG 14 and 17 was greatly reduced in cultured cells at plateau phase in comparison to log phase cells, suggesting that modification of HMG 14 and 17 is growth-associated. However, phosphorylation was not linked to DNA synthesis, since incorporation of 32P did not vary through G1 and S phase in synchronized Chinese hamster ovary cells. Treatment of HT-29 or Ehrlich ascites cells with sodium butyrate reduced HMG phosphorylation by 30 and 70%, respectively. The distribution of the phosphorylated HMG proteins in chromatin was examined using micrococcal nuclease and DNase I. 32P-HMG 14 and 17 were preferentially associated with micrococcal nuclease-sensitive regions as demonstrated by the release of a substantial fraction of the phosphorylated forms of these proteins under conditions which solubilized less than 3% of the DNA. Short digestions with DNase I did not show a marked release of 32P-HMG 14 or 17."

The enzyme was shown to be homogeneous by two-dimensional electrophoresis, Sepharose 6B column chromatography, and high performance liquid chromatography utilizing a size exclusion column. The subunit molecular weight of the enzyme was found to be 95,000 by electrophoresis in the presence of sodium dodecyl sulfate. In solutions of low ionic strength, the native enzyme aggregated to species of higher molecular weight than did the rabbit muscle phosphofructokinase. In the presence of 0.2 M (NH4)2SO4, the minimum native molecular weight was determined to be 398,000 by high performance liquid chromatography and Sepharose 6B column chromatography. Therefore, the enzyme appears to be a tetramer with identical or near-identical subunits. The apparent isoelectric point of the enzyme was shown to be 7.3 to 7.4 by both column and gel isoelectric focusing. Amino acid analysis revealed a lower number of the aromatic residues Phe, Tyr, and Trp than in the rabbit muscle enzyme and this is in agreement with the lower extinction coefficient of E1%280 nm = 6.5.

Total RNA extracted from experimental and control hearts was translated in vitro and hybridized with polyuridylate. Synthesis of protein and polyadenylate-containing RNA was greater in rat hearts perfused with extracts of hypertrophying dog hearts than in control hearts. The results demonstrate that molecules from hypertrophying dog hearts are not species-specific since they are effective in stimulating transcription of messenger RNA in rat hearts as well as in dog hearts.

https://openalex.org/W1571959891,"RNA polymerase specifically primes the replication of M13 DNA but not phi X174 DNA in vivo and in crude extracts of Escherichia coli. Yet purified preparations of RNA polymerase have been observed not to distinguish between the two templates. We investigated the basis for specificity by assaying priming and transcriptional activities on single-stranded phage DNAs covered by single-stranded DNA-binding protein. In the course of preparing homogeneous RNA polymerase holoenzyme, loss of specificity and decreased priming activity resulted from procedures which removed the rho subunit. Specificity was restored and priming activity was increased upon the addition of rho subunit to core RNA polymerase. Priming of replication depended on a very limited transcription, presumably confined to the unique sequence in M13 DNA that directs the origin of complementary strand synthesis. No transcription was observed on phi X174 DNA comparably covered by binding protein. Thus, the specific priming of M13 DNA replication in E. coli depends on recognition of an origin sequence by an RNA polymerase holoenzyme with a functional rho subunit. Priming specificity for M13 DNA replication thus provides a sensitive and simple test for the activity of the rho subunit of E. coli RNA polymerase, even though the M13 origin region lacks the sequences characteristic of RNA polymerase promoters."
https://openalex.org/W1487344153,"rho proteins isolated from strains of Escherichia coli with the suA1, suA100, and suA120 polarity suppressor mutant alleles of the rho gene are shown to be defective in termination of T7 DNA transcription in vitro. These mutant rho factors are found to be less active than normal rho in catalyzing the hydrolysis of ATP with isolated T7 RNA as cofactor, and their lower ATPase activities correlate well with their decreased abilities to mediate release of RNA from isolated T7 DNA transcription complexes. The mutant rho factors also have lower ATPase activities than wild type rho with certain synthetic RNA polymers, but they have full activity with poly(C). Because the mutant rho factors have normal ATPase activity with some RNAs, we conclude that their defects are in their abilities to interact with certain RNA cofactors and not in their catalytic capacities. Binding studies indicate that their defects do not appear to involve the primary interaction between rho and RNA. When poly(dC) is used to saturate the primary site for RNA on rho, the Km values for (Cp)7C as a secondary site activator of rho ATPase are 3.4, 80, and 15 microM for rho from the strains with the wild type, suA1, and suA100 alleles, respectively. These results suggest that the defects in the rho factors isolated from strains with the polarity suppressor alleles suA1 and suA100 involve their abilities to interact with RNA at their secondary sites."

One hundred and forty samples were tested and the results showed four different alleles of PGM4 whose frequencies were under Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium."

https://openalex.org/W1577258651,"The hydrolysis of ATP catalyzed by sarcoplasmic reticulum vesicles prepared from rabbit skeletal muscle was studied by microcalorimetry in parallel with measuring the extent of hydrolysis and the level of the phosphorylated intermediate (E approximately P) of the Ca2+-ATPase in the reaction medium containing 100 mM MgCl2, 0.1 mM CaCl2, 20 mM 3-(N-morpholino)propanesulfonic acid/KOH (pH 7.1). During the first few turnovers of the enzyme catalytic cycle, when an appreciable amount of E approximately P is still present, the observed heat is much smaller than the heat expected from the amount of ATP hydrolyzed. Since the accompanying Ca2+ uptake, inclusive of Ca2+ binding to internal sites, is associated with very little heat change (Kodama, T., Kurebayashi, N., and Ogawa, Y. (1980) J. Biochem. (Tokyo) 88, 1259-1265), this result indicates that the formation of E approximately P is endothermic and hence driven by a large increase in entropy. The overall exothermicity of the ATP hydrolysis is brought about by the subsequent, strongly exothermic decomposition of E approximately P."
